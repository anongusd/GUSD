Overall, the number of primary care physicians rose from 196,014 in 2005 to 204,419 in 2015. But because of disproportionate losses of providers in rural areas, the average number of physicians for every 100,000 people declined from 46.6 to 41.1 #RuralHealth @JAMA_current @aafp

"I hope all of you are excited about this future because I'm excited about the future of #rural #healthcare. For any area where there is this much dedication to patients and this much openness to innovation, you can't help but be optimistic." - @SecAzar #RuralHealth #NRHAPolicy19
"With modern technology, your survival rate should not depend on your zip code... For someone in a city or suburb, that (telehealth) is convenient; for a patient in a #rural area, it could be life-changing." - @SecAzar #RuralHealth #NRHAPolicy19
"Patients need access to care to prevent and manage illnesses. High quality care, whether because it's curative or enables the patient to live a more active, healthy life, can sometimes pay for itself in the long run." - @SecAzar #RuralHealth #NRHAPolicy19
"The #ruralhealth task force is examining all aspects of our rural health policies, looking closely at how payments are affecting rural hospitals." - @SecAzar #NRHAPolicy19
"Our goals for #rural #healthcare are simple: We need care in rural areas to be affordable. We need care to be as accessible as possible. And we want that care to be high quality. We know where we want to go...sustainability, innovation, and flexibility." - @SecAzar #NRHAPolicy19
"That's why we have identified #ruralhealth as a priority, too. Better meeting the needs of #rural communities is going to require transforming how we meet those needs. For that reason, I pulled together a rural health task force at @HHSGov." - @SecAzar #NRHAPolicy19
"Each of these priority areas has important implications for rural providers and communities they serve. But they're also important to mention because the reason I picked them as priorities is the same reason that #ruralhealth is a priority for @HHSGov." - @SecAzar #NRHAPolicy19
"The #opioidcrisis is one of the 4 priorities I have identified as Secretary, alongside value-based transformation of our healthcare system, addressing the cost and availability of insurance, and bringing down the cost of prescription drugs." - @SecAzar #RuralHealth #NRHAPolicy19

Through equitable and sustainable reimbursements and continued funding, we can ensure that CHCs can continue to service the underserved and #rural communities that so desperately need them #RuralHealth @NACHC
CHCs are community-based and patient-directed organizations that serve populations with limited access to health care. Most CHCs are based in #rural America, where care options are limited #RuralHealth #HealthDisparities @NACHC @GOPHELP @HELPCmteDems
Community Health Centers are a key piece of the #ruralhealth safety net, meeting the need for care in underserved populations. There are currently more than 1,400 community health centers across the country that provide care to more than 25 million Americans #RuralHealth @NACHC
To keep rural health clinics open, we need #Medicare reimbursement rates for provider-based and independent RHCs that are uniformly capped to save money and create equity #RuralHealth @NARHC1
RHC closures impacted over 3.86 million individuals living in #rural and underserved areas. The total estimated economic impact of RHC closures since 2012 is 3,667 total jobs lost and $284,048,661 in payroll #RuralHealth @GOPHELP @HELPCmteDems
Rural health clinics (RHCs) are closing, leaving rural communities without necessary primary care. Reimbursement, regulatory and policy changes have created challenges for RHCs. Since 2012, there have been 388 RHC closures #RuralHealth @HELPCmteDems @GOPHELP
Keep #rural hospital doors open:	1) Stop the cuts: Repeal harmful changes to #Medicare that have caused an increase in negative operating margins, and 	2) Create a path forward: Design a new model that allows flexibility while ensuring access to emergency care 	#RuralHealth

The impacts of closures go beyond the loss of access to care for patients in these rural communities. Often, a #rural #hospital is the first or second largest employer in a community, so when it closes, many jobs - and insurance benefits of the employees - are lost #RuralHealth

A6: Rural counties with higher %s of African American women were more than 10x as likely as rural counties with higher %s of white women to have never had OB services and more than 4x as likely to have lost OB services between 2004-2014 #RuralHealthChat @ruralhealthinfo @UMNRHRC
A6: Within #rural communities there is also variance. While urban areas remain more diverse, rural areas are experiencing increasing #diversity @ruralhealthinfo https://t.co/sUkQA8QLGA
A6: While the Midwest has seen changes that impact their rural hospitals, southern #rural communities with high poverty and racial disparities have been particularly hard hit by the closure crisis #RuralHealthChat @RHIHub @UNCSheps  https://t.co/kKSFPLLruv
A6: Every #rural community possesses needs specific to the demographics of the area and its location. The needs of a small town on the plains of Nebraska are different than a frontier community in Wyoming or a remote Appalachian community in West Virginia #RuralHealthChat @RHIHub https://t.co/b44bepNc8s
A5: #Rural providers are the pillar of the community. As John Henderson, CEO of Childress Regional Hospital in Texas explains, “#Hospitals, schools, churches. It’s the three-legged stool. If one of those falls down, you don’t have a town.” #RuralHealthChat @ruralhealthinfo https://t.co/EA7ChPIUOF
A5: They're more than just care. #Rural hospitals propel the economy forward. If every vulnerable rural hospital closes, we will lose 236,000 jobs. Annual income in rural communities will decrease by $703 and rural unemployment would increase by 1.6% #RuralHealthChat @RHIHub https://t.co/JU6GwFEAta
A5: When a #ruralhospital closes, it has a ripple effect across services – primary care, emergency services, maternity care – that cause unnecessary, completely preventable deaths #RuralHealthChat @RHIHub @jackhealyNYT #NationalRuralHealthDay		https://t.co/PHOymwycIz

On average, #rural trauma victims must travel 2x to the closest hospital. In an emergency, every second counts. When a community loses access to its ER, we lose lives. 60% of trauma deaths occur in #rural America because there isn’t adequate access #RuralHealthChat @RHIHub https://t.co/3QbvdwkVhU

@JohnCullenMD @ruralhealthinfo we couldn't agree more John! Those living with full #access to quality, affordable #healthcare services don't know what it's like to live life in a medical desert #RuralHealthChat
A2: Challenges for delivery of #rural #healthcare include: older and poorer patient populations, low patient volumes and high rates of publicly insured #Medicare and #Medicaid recipients, uninsured and underinsured populations #RuralHealthChat @RHIHub @NOSORH

"A mom is going to die, and until that happens enough no one is going to change it. It’s inevitable if you have to go that far for health care.” This isn't the first time we've heard a doctor say this after an OB closure #RuralHealth https://t.co/rra9bVPvlu @jackhealyNYT
What are women's options now? Emergency room delivery, but as one local #obstetrician says, "The ER is a bad place to have a baby; it’s just not set up for it. Even for us (obstetricians), when we go to deliver a baby in an emergency room, it’s much more difficult." #RuralHealth
Mesa View Regional Hospital, a Nevada CAH, closed its #obstetrics unit October 1. Now, expecting mothers in the #rural area must travel either to St. George, Utah, about 40 miles northeast, or to a hospital in Las Vegas, 82 miles southwest #RuralHealth	https://t.co/hcvKNfuTSx

88 #rural hospitals have closed since 2010. In Alan Levine's home state of Tennessee, a 9th rural hospital closed just as he was visiting an expanding hospital in Memphis. Rural hospitals continue to struggle #RuralHealth
Medicare #baddebt cuts now equate to over $1 billion in lost revenue for #rural hospitals, a small number for federal budgets but losses that push rural hospitals to closure. Reversing these cuts costs Congress little and keeps care in rural communities #RuralHealth
The #ACA included cuts to programs to help hospitals with unpaid bills and charity care, since #Medicaid Expansion and increased insurance coverage would reduce this burden. However, many rural states have not expanded Medicaid #RuralHealth @HELPCmteDems @GOPHELP
The @TransUnion study explained the issue’s predominant culprit: higher deductibles. Unaffordable plans mean increasing unpaid bills, known as bad debt for providers. #Rural hospital #baddebt has increased by 50% since 2010, an increase not see by urban providers #RuralHealth
A recent @TransUnion study found a significant increase in the number of patients unable to pay their hospital bills. The study revealed that 68% of patients with bills of $500 or less did not pay off the full balance during 2016 – up from 53% in 2015 and 49% in 2014 #RuralHealth

Over the last two months, the number of rural hospital closures has risen rapidly to 87. In rural America, health care is a pillar of the community. Without health care, without a hospital, a rural community will crumble #SaveRural #RuralHealth	 https://t.co/9nmnun9CdN

Many #veterans living in #rural areas fail to get the help they need and are entitled to because of barriers to care. Unsurprisingly, the largest barrier is often the geographic distance to the nearest @DeptVetAffairs facility #RuralHealth #RuralVets
3.2 million #rural veterans are enrolled in @DeptVetAffairs health care system, comprising 35% of total enrollees. Despite higher numbers of veterans in rural areas, VA facilities are scarce in rural America #RuralHealth #RuralVets
Rural Americans are on average older, sicker, and poorer than their urban and suburban counterparts. Veterans in rural America are no different, and they often face health challenges and complications that their rural neighbors don’t have to consider #RuralVets #RuralHealth

The loss of maternity care in rural America is the result of workforce shortages, low birth volumes, and insufficient Medicaid reimbursements. The Improving Access to Maternity Care Act is a step in the right direction, and we thank @SenDonnelly for his support #RuralHealth
85 #rural hospitals have closed since 2010, and between 2004 and 2014, more than 200 rural OB units closed their doors. These closure numbers continue to rise. Without Congressional intervention, more hospitals will close, and lives will be lost #DeliveringRuralBabies
Dr. James Turner (Richard G. Lugar Center for Rural Health) said, “Over 30 Indiana counties are without hospital-based OB Services for pregnant women... This bill is a first step in helping identify areas in our state where it is difficult for women to find the care they need.” https://t.co/utVs4JQky8
Of his support, @SenDonnelly said, "Hoosier mothers deserve access to quality maternal care, no matter where they live. Unfortunately, too many Indiana communities face a shortage or even lack of maternity care professionals and services..." #DeliveringRuralBabies #RuralHealth

We need funding to fight the #opioidepidemic to ensure states hardest hit have an opportunity to recover. The current formula does not sufficiently consider the scope of the crisis in small states #RuralHealth #21stCenturyCures @HouseCommerce @EnergyCommerce
Texas and California, though larger states with bigger populations, had proportionately some of the lowest overdose death rates in the country. Nevertheless, Texas received $27.3 million and California received $44.7 million #RuralHealth #21stCenturyCures #OpioidEpidemic
West Virginia has the highest overdose death rate in the country, but only received $5.8 million out of the $500 million allocated for this year. Second-ranked New Hampshire was given $3.1 million #RuralHealth #21stCenturyCures #OpioidEpidemic
In 21st Century Cures, Congress authorized funding to combat the #opioidepidemic. This funding is being allocated to states by mortality rate and size of a state, but Congress intended it be distributed using a per-capita formula to account for smaller states' needs #RuralHealth
And though Medication Assisted Treatment has been proven to be a successful treatment for opioid abuse, it is nearly nonexistent in rural. Of the 2.2% of physicians that have obtained a waiver to prescribe Buprenorphine, less than 10% are in rural counties #RuralHealth
65% of rural counties do not have a practicing psychiatrist, 47% lack a psychologist, and 81% lack a psychiatric nurse practitioner. For those struggling with mental and behavioral health issues in #rural America, care is nearly nonexistent #RuralHealth #MentalHealth
13% of #rural counties have no behavioral health providers and, in the counties where there are providers, the provider to population ratio is much lower than in urban counties #RuralHealth #MentalHealth
Although the prevalence of clinically deﬁned behavioral health problems and the rate of Substance Use Disorder among adults is similar in rural and urban, the availability and accessibility of behavioral health services is limited for those in rural communities #RuralHealth
While only 20% of Americans live in #rural areas, a disproportionate number of rural communities are struggling with substance use disorders. Due to lack of services and higher abuse rates, the rate of overdose deaths in nonmetro counties is 45% higher than in metro #RuralHealth

The program was expanded to cover more #rural entities that serve the original #340B population: low income, underserved, vulnerable@patients #RuralHealth #Rural340B https://t.co/yLjVvoWUqg
We support robust oversight but we cannot support requirements that divert sparse dollars from patient care to administrative burden. Small #rural providers do not have large staffs or employees who can focus exclusively on the #340B program #RuralHealth #Rural340B
Rural hospitals use their contract pharmacy benefit to support uncompensated care, but they are also more likely to rely on their benefit to maintain their operations and keep their doors open #RuralHealth #Rural340B @340BHealth https://t.co/5RPRRw7iPf
Rural hospitals use their contract pharmacy benefit to support services in rural areas to treat a number of chronic and life-threatening conditions, including diabetes (78%), oncology (57%), cardiac diseases (54%), and pulmonary diseases	(50%) #RuralHealth #Rural340B @340BHealth
The @340BHealth study found that 65%  of #rural hospitals did not have their own outpatient pharmacy, and 60% reported relying on contract pharmacies for over half of their overall 340B benefit #RuralHealth #Rural340B
In a @340BHealth study, hospitals unanimously reported that a loss of or reduction in their contract pharmacy benefit would impair their ability to serve	low-income and rural patients #RuralHealth #Rural340B
As we discuss the role of contract pharmacies in the #340B program, we must remember the key role they play in helping small, #rural hospitals without their own pharmacy provide #340B benefits #RuralHealth #Rural340B
The purpose of the #340B program is to ensure access to care for low-income, vulnerable patients. We must ensure that regulations regarding oversight of the program continue to put patients before paperwork #Rural340B #RuralHealth
As we move forward in considering legislation that will ensure #340B dollars are used appropriately, we must prevent oversight and regulation from becoming so onerous as to force small #rural providers to use the majority of 340B proceeds for compliance #RuralHealth #Rural340B
When #rural hospitals close, the low income are the hardest hit. These populations are the most likely to struggle to travel to more distant providers due to lack of transportation, the cost of child care, and hourly wage jobs #RuralHealth #Rural340B #340B https://t.co/rGOfzLG5jV
Thank you @repgregwalden for noting how critical #340B is in ensuring that #rural hospitals can keep their doors open to serve vulnerable patient populations. Just last month, three more hospitals announced that they will have to soon close their doors #RuralHealth #Rural340B
For many rural hospitals #340B is used to prevent closure. In fact, 75% of participating #rural hospitals use 340B savings just to keep their doors open. Currently, 44% of rural hospitals operate at a loss, and more than 1/3 are vulnerable to closure #RuralHealth #Rural340B https://t.co/Gv3xBCRNmM
As the Energy and Commerce Committee considers legislation this week to increase oversight of the program, we must remember the critical role #340B plays in providing community care in remote rural areas #RuralHealth @HouseCommerce @EnergyCommerce
Supporting policies that decrease costs for rural providers and patients is an ever-important measure, and one that will help spur rural economic growth and secure a strong, healthy rural future. One program that helps keep rural hospitals afloat is the #340B Program #RuralHealth https://t.co/OKtNosPdS1

85 rural hospitals have closed since 2010, and 673 are vulnerable. If those 673 hospitals closed, rural patients would need to seek alternatives for 11.7 million hospitals visits, 99,000 health care workers' jobs, and $277 billion in lost GDP #RuralHealth #FarmBill

In @SenatorBaldwin's state, one CAH has used #340B to expand its dental clinic in order to serve #Medicaid and uninsured patients. Oral health care is desperately need in #rural communities throughout Wisconsin and the country #RuralHealth
More #rural hospitals were covered under during an expansion of the #340B program for rural providers in 2010 and subsequently became covered entities. This has allowed these rural hospitals to keep their doors open and provide critical community care #RuralHealth
Rural Alabama has been losing hospitals "left and right," explains @SenDougJones. In his state, 35 entities use the #340B program, and for them it is critical to keeping their doors open #RuralHealth

In @SenTinaSmith's state of Minnesota, many #rural facilities are struggling to recruit and retain staff, treat substance use disorders, and serve an older, sicker population. This is why #340B is critical for rural Minneostans #RuralHealth
We agree with @SenatorHassan's concerns about the pressure that audits for #340B facilities places on small rural hospitals with thin operating margins. This puts an enormous administration burden on struggling providers #RuralHealth
In @SenatorHassan's state of New Hampshire, #340B providers are using the program to provide substance use disorder treatments both in the hospital and after release. This is the critical role that the 340B program plays in #rural areas #RuralHealth
In its role overseeing #340B, @HRSAgov ensures effective administration of the program. We understand the need for improved and reformed oversight of 340B, but we cannot change the program in a way that inhibits its support of rural providers #RuralHealth
We can ensure that the #340B program is being used as the program was intended through effective oversight, while still keeping the program intact to support those communities in need #RuralHealth
As @PattyMurray explains, the original purpose of the #340B program was to "stretch scarce federal resources", and nowhere is this more poignant and more important than in #rural areas #RuralHealth https://t.co/3WGIcbw7NK
In the past, members of Congress have worked to provide rural providers with the certainty they need. When considering the #340B Program, Congress must acknowledge the key role that it plays in keeping the rural health safety net intact #RuralHealth
In fact, 75% of participating #rural hospitals use #340B savings just to keep their doors open. In the fluctuating healthcare landscape, it is imperative that we not forget the rural providers caring for the most vulnerable in our nation #RuralHealth
Over 90% of participating hospitals use #340B savings to offset costs of the under- and uninsured. Without these savings, 73% of hospitals will have to reduce staff, 71% will have to reduce pharmacy services, and 40% would have to close one or more clinics #RuralHealth #Rural340B

Many rural Americans live in areas with limited health care resources, restricting their options for care, including purchasing prescriptions. Rural areas also have an older population with more chronic illnesses, with a greater need for affordable medications #RuralHealth

The Improving Access to Maternity Care Act (S.783/ H.R. 315) would improve the geographic distribution of maternity care providers by creating maternity health professional target areas #DeliveringRuralBabies #MaternalHealthEquity @ACOGAction @ACNMmidwives @everymomcounts
Workforce retention challenges reported by hospitals are related to their rural location and low birth volume. Geographic maldistribution of health care providers has resulted in a relative shortage of maternity care providers in rural #DeliveringRuralBabies #MaternalHealthEquity
More than three-quarters of rural hospitals with less than 300 births a year have shared nurse staff, and midwives attend deliveries in 1/3 of rural hospitals #DeliveringRuralBabies #MaternalHealthEquity @ACNMmidwives
Hospitals with lower birth volume (less than 240 per year) are more likely to have family physicians and general surgeons attending deliveries, whereas hospitals with a higher birth volume more frequently have obstetricians and midwives attending deliveries #DeliveringRuralBabies
As OB units close and hospitals continue to struggle, rural communities are also grappling with a shortage of maternity care providers. Hospitals with OB care are struggling to retain maternity care providers #MaternalHealthEquity #DeliveringRuralBabies @TheHillEvents
“I received calls from rural Southern mothers who are on #Medicaid, and there is not a single doctor who will give them the care they need” -@HerreraBeutler #MaternalHealthEquity #DeliveringRuralBabies #RuralHealth
“This is certainly an issue with race, gender, class, and region.” -@HerreraBeutler #MaternalHealthEquity #DeliveringRuralBabies https://t.co/InNSOjIVVS
As @RepGwenMoore explains, health care is critical in creating #MaternalHealthEquity. More than half of rural births are services that are covered under Medicaid, and reimbursement rates for rural hospitals are a continuing issue #DeliveringRuralBabies #RuralHealth @TheHillEvents
When @RepGwenMoore saw the state of #MaternalHealthEquity, she knew she needed to act in Congress to defend our most vulnerable communities and families and ensure a healthy future for rural mothers #DeliveringRuralBabies #RuralHealth https://t.co/L1hO6CqgqU
More than half of women in rural communities live more than the recommended 30 minutes from a hospital offering OB services. There is a clear disparity between the availability of maternity care between #rural and urban communities #MaternalHealthEquity #DeliveringRuralBabies
In his district in #rural Kansas, @RogerMarshallMD worked to ensure that every woman had access to prenatal care. Too many rural women do not have access to this care which is critcal for ensuring that both mother and child are healthy #MaternalHealthEquity #DeliveringRuralBabies
Rep. @RogerMarshallMD is an OBGYN who has delivered babies himself and has seen firsthand how devastating the effects of #maternalhealth disparities are #DeliveringRuralBabies #MaternalHealthEquity
Rural counties with higher %s of African American women were more than 10 times as likely as rural counties with higher %s of white women to have never had hospital-based OB services and more than 4 times as likely to have lost OB services between 2004-2014 #MaternalHealthEquity
The most vulnerable communities are the most likely to be without maternity care: low-income, health care shortage areas, minority populations, and the most remote locations #MaternalHealthEquity #DeliveringRuralBabies @TheHillEvents @ACOGAction @ACNMmidwives
The loss of maternity care in rural America is the result of multiple factors including: workforce shortages, low birth volumes, and stingy Medicaid programs #MaternalHealthEquity #DeliveringRuralBabies @ACOGAction @ACNMmidwives @TheHillEvents
When distance to maternity care is directly correlated with outcomes, this shortage has a devastating effect. Rural babies are being born outside of hospitals or in hospitals without OB care, and infant mortality rates are rising #MaternalHealthEquity #DeliveringRuralBabies
Still, from 1985 to 2002, the number of rural hospitals without obstetric services grew from 24% to 44%. Today, more than half of rural counties have no hospital-based obstetrics services #MaternalHealthEquity #DeliveringRuralBabies @TheHillEvents @ACOGAction @ACNMmidwives
The number of #rural hospitals without an OB unit or any OB care is growing rapidly, placing expecting mothers at risk. 18 million reproductive-age women live in rural areas across the US, and half a million babies are born in rural hospitals every year #MaternalHealthEquity

Lack of plan competition in rural markets, exorbitant premiums, deductibles, and co-pays, and lack of Medicaid expansion, coupled with devastating Medicare cuts to rural providers have collided to create a health care crisis in rural America #RuralHealth @RepTerriSewell
Thank you to one of our strongest #ruralhealth advocates, @RepTerriSewell, for discussing the need to provide the uninsured and underinsured in #rural areas of Alabama with affordable, quality care #SaveRural
In @WaysandMeansGOP, one of our constant #ruralhealth advocates asks about regulatory barriers to access care in #rural areas, specifically around accessing prescriptions #SaveRural
Thank you for @RepGuthrie for asking what role @HHSGov can play in ensuring that babies born with #NeonatalAbstinenceSyndrome have access to care programs, especially for the many babies born with NAS in #Appalachia and his district in Kentucky #RuralHealth https://t.co/ui5AMSp1bV
There are many reasons why more patients are struggling to make their healthcare payments in full, the most prominent of which are higher deductibles and the increase in patient responsibility from 10% to 30% over the last few years #RuralHealth
One recent study (TransUnion Healthcare) found a significant increase in the number of patients that were unable to completely pay their hospital bills. The study revealed that 68% of patients with bills of $500 or less did not pay off the full balance during 2016 #RuralHealth
A hospital incurs bad debt when it is unable to obtain reimbursement for already provided care. Most commonly, this occurs because patients are unable to pay their hospital bills, but do not apply for financial assistance #RuralHealth
A laudable goal of the Affordable Care Act was to significantly decrease bad debt; however, because of unaffordable health plans in rural areas, rural patients still cannot afford health care. Bad debt among rural hospitals has increased 50% since the ACA was passed #RuralHealth
This issue is also being discussed in @WaysMeansCmte @WaysandMeansGOP right now, in another hearing focused on consumer-directed health care plans #RuralHealth https://t.co/drlUoO625F
Though uninsured rates have dropped, many rural insured are still unable to pay their medical bills: “If someone goes from no insurance to a high-deductible plan, they are effectively uninsured,” says one rural hospital CEO #RuralHealth @RepStefanik
In 2017 41% of rural marketplace enrollees had only a single option of insurer and current estimates show this number is likely to be much higher with many estimating well over 50% in 2018 #RuralHealth @RepStefanik
On the East Coast, @RepStefanik's district is one of the most rural, and she knows just how critical it is to ensure that we have affordable health care options to ensure positive health care outcomes #RuralHealth #RebuildRural
Thank you @RepByrne for recognizing the key role that rural hospitals play in providing critical community care and supporting the rural economy. Those who lose when we don't support our rural patients and providers are the individuals in poor rural areas  #RuralHealth #SaveRural
In @RepByrne's state of Alabama, they've lost 12 #rural hospitals. It is a "crisis, and we're going to lose more hospitals if we don't do something... The difference between a 45 minute hospital ride and a 10 minute ride is the difference between life and death" #RuralHealth
In @RepLouBarletta's district in #rural Pennsylvania, it is critical that seniors are able to access their medications at their community pharmacy. Local options are even more important for the older, sicker, poorer populations in #rural America #RuralHealth

Dr. Perez will no longer be delivering Southeast Missouri's babies. The next nearest obstetrics unit is in Poplar Bluff, an hour's drive away. Many of his patients can't afford a car. This is the reality for many expecting mothers in #rural America #DeliveringRuralBabies https://t.co/sAaUe2xrPu
Dr. Nelson Perez has been the only full-time OB-GYN at the Kennett hospital for several years. He said he typically delivers around 400 babies each year — about 100 more than a typical OB-GYN. When the hospital closes, his practice will close #RuralHealth #DeliveringRuralBabies
What does this mean for the expecting mothers of southeast Missouri? They are now scrambling to change their birth plans, a dangerous proposition in an area with the worst birth outcomes in the state and one of the highest infant mortality rates in the US https://t.co/lhIypNsgn7
Remaining resources at Twin Rivers Regional Medical Center will be consolidated with those operations at Poplar Bluff Regional Medical Center, and some jobs will be offered to the unemployed, but Poplar Bluff is over an hour away from Twin Rivers location in Kennett #RuralHealth

Just a few days ago @SenatorCardin @MarkWarner @SenJohnThune and @JohnCornyn introduced legislation to ensure the continuum of services and the expansion of telehealth treatment to respond to the #opioidepidemic in rural communities #RuralHealth
We need longterm incentives in order to encourage providers to come to communities that have no one to ensure care for the local community. Thank you to @MarkWarner for asking about this important issue #RuralHealth
At @RUPRIHealth, Dr. Mueller is researching the expansion of #telehealth services in providing care for the most remote areas. This could be key for remote areas in @SenJohnThune's state of South Dakota #RuralHealth
In @SenJohnThune's home state of South Dakota, there are a variety of barriers and complications they face on a daily basis - one of which is attracting providers to the area #RuralHealth
More and more babies are born with NAS and we need to work with #rural providers to ensure access to care for these infants and families. The #CRIB Act would help support facilities like @BrigidsPath in Ohio expand access to critical care #RuralHealth #OpioidEpidemic https://t.co/41U0ux6vUr
In Ohio, they have programs that work to help babies born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome, and few rural areas have the ability to provide the unique care necessary for this care #RuralHealth @senrobportman
Ohio has a number of small rural hospitals, many which are at risk of closure, and when they close those struggling with the #opioidepidemic will be acutely harmed #RuralHealth @senrobportman @SenSherrodBrown
Thank you @SenatorCarper for asking about how to increase services for mental and behavioral health in #rural areas. We need to invest in education and telemedicine, as well as recruitment and integration of services #RuralHealth
Rural America's communities are more likely to be overweight, to use tobacco, and to have high risk behaviors than their urban counterparts. This is why we need to ensure that our care provision recognizes these risk factors #RuralHeatlh #HealthDisparities https://t.co/mNwSanqSOU
"The doctor shortages issue for rural communities continues. We have counties in our state that have 4,000 people and no access" - @SenatorCantwell #RuralHealth #WorkforceShortages

Rural hospitals are key pieces of the struggling rural economy. Quality rural health care not only saves lives, it provides jobs, attracts businesses, and reinvests millions back into rural communities #RuralHealth https://t.co/YAmrc9EdYN
Eighty-four rural hospitals have closed since 2010.  44% of all rural hospitals operate at a loss and 1 in 3 rural hospitals is vulnerable. Closures of this magnitude will create a crisis in access to emergency services as well as significantly harm rural economies #RuralHealth
We need innovative and effective policies, and we need models that we can work on rapidly. Thank you Dr. Pink for sharing your research and ideas on what is needed for rural hospitals and providers #RuralHealth @uncsheps
These communities have significantly higher proportions of being majority minority, low-income, obese, and at risk for poor health outcomes. They are some of the most vulnerable populations in the country, and they are often the first to lose a hospital #RuralHealth
Rural hospitals serve a population that is on average older, sicker, and poorer than their urban counterparts. The patients are also often uninsured or underinsured #RuralHealth

As @OrrinHatch, and the entire Finance Committee recognizes, it is key that we provide affordable, quality care in our communities. We must ensure "appropriate access" and "protect Medicare Beneficiaries" #RuralHealth
Flexible and sustainable models that focus on improving access and population health are a significant part of the solution. We believe that flexibility is key for rural communities, and a “one-size fits all” approach to rural policy is destined for failure #RuralHealth

Nearly 3 out of every 5 areas facing a primary care shortage program are rural. That's why it is essential to ensure that graduating physicians are encouraged to provide care in rural areas #RuralHealth #WorkforceShortages @PattyMurray
Thank you to @PattyMurray for discussing the many programs that @HRSAgov provides in order to better address #workforceshortages in rural areas, especially in the most undeserved and vulnerable communities #RuralHealth
Maternity care shortages in rural America are severe. In 1985, 24% of rural counties lacked OB services. Today, 54% of rural counties are without hospital-based OB.  More than 200 rural maternity wards closed between 2004 and 2014 #RuralHealth #WorkforceShortages @ACOGAction
47 rural Tennessee counties have not a single OBGYN, according to @ACOGAction. These shortages in obstetrics services put expecting mothers and children at risk #RuralHealth #WorkforceShortages @SenAlexander
Thank you @SenAlexander for discussing how significant workforce shortages are in rural areas. In rural communities, there are only 39 physicians to 100,000 people, compared to urban areas where there are 53 physicians to 100,000 people #RuralHealth
77%of the 2,050 rural counties in the United States are designated as primary care Health Professional Shortage Areas by @HRSAgov, and only 9% of physicians practice in rural areas #RuralHealth #WorkforceShortages
Many rural residents experience a lack of basic health services even though the larger society cannot absorb all the health care professionals that are produced #RuralHealth
One of the most enduring characteristics of the rural health landscape is the shortage of health care professionals. These shortages exist across every field of health care in rural America, and affect the life of the 60 million Americans living in rural communities #RuralHealth
This morning, we're watching @HELPCmteDems @GOPHELP hearing: "The Health Care Workforce: Addressing Shortages and Improving Care" #RuralHealth #WorkforceShortages

Attacks on Medicaid would only worsen the opioid crisis for many rural Americans. We need to work together to protect Medicaid as a funding source to provide treatment #RuralHealth #YouthOpioidAwareness @SenSherrodBrown @TheHillEvents

“There’s a balance - we don’t want people to suffer but we have to learn how to use opioids more carefully, especially for young people.” -@SecretaryLevine #RuralHealth #YouthOpioidAwareness
In Pennsylvania, @SecretaryLevine works with the medical community, schools, and community organizations to develop a holistic approach to stopping the spread of #opioids and addiction #RuralHealth #YouthOpioidAwareness
Next we’ll hear from @SecretaryLevine, Pennsylvania Secretary of Health. As one of the most rural states in the country, Pennsylvania has been hard hit by the #opioidcrisis in many of the state’s communities #RuralHealth #YouthOpioidAwareness @TheHillEvents
On addressing provider shortages, @SenCapito discusses the role that telehealth can play in care delivery for those communities that don’t have a mental health provider #RuralHealth #YouthOpioidAwareness
We need proportional distribution of funding to ensure the states hardest hit by the opioid epidemic have an opportunity to recover. The current formula does not sufficiently consider the scope of the crisis and favors larger states #RuralHealth #YouthOpioidAwareness @SenCapito
West Virginia had the highest overdose death rate in the country, but only received $5.8 million out of the $500 million allocated last year. States with bigger populations, who received more money, had proportionately some of the lowest overdose deaths @SenCapito #RuralHealth
We are proud supporters of @SenCapito’s Targeted Opioid Formula Act, S. 2125, which would change the formula used for allocating opioid funding so that states most in need receive funding by reducing emphasis on population in the formula #RuralHealth #YouthOpioidAwareness
In 55% of all American counties, most of which are rural, there are no psychologists, psychiatrists or social workers. This is why “our biggest issue is manpower” - @SenCapito #RuralHealth #YouthOpioidAwareness
The specific challenges for rural America are the “lack of providers and the lack of treatment...we were ill prepared to address this need.” -@SenCapito #RuralHealth #YouthOpioidAwareness

We thank @RepOHalleran for acknowledging the specific needs of rural communities that are struggling with substance use disorders, and we appreciate his work to enable providers to find innovative community solutions through the Rural DOCS Act #RuralHealth #OpioidCrisis
The Rural DOCS Act, sponsored by @RepOHalleran requires @CMSGov to carry out a demonstration project to provide an enhanced Federal matching rate for state Medicaid expenditures related to the expansion of treatment and recovery services focusing on provider capacity #RuralHealth
Only one piece of legislation being considered today in the @HouseCommerce @EnergyCommerce markup is specific to the needs of rural Americans: H.R. 5477, the Rural Development of Opioid Capacity Services Act #RuralHealth #OpioidCrisis @RepOHalleran
We must work together to develop a holistic approach that identifies treatment solutions that are practical for even the most remote areas and which address the causes of increased rates of substance abuse #RuralHealth #OpioidCrisis
Substance abuse has torn through vulnerable rural communities with few health care resources and limited economic opportunity creating landscapes of despair. As we work to address the #opioidcrisis in our nation, we cannot afford to leave rural America behind #RuralHealth https://t.co/5HjsyH8vXu
While the #opioidcrisis has now impacted communities across the country, we cannot forget the devastating toll it has taken on rural communities already still struggling to recover from the Great Recession #RuralHealth
In rural communities, behavioral health is even scarcer. 13% of rural counties have no behavioral health providers. 65% of rural counties do not have a practicing psychiatrist, 47% lack a psychologist, and 81% lack a psychiatric nurse practitioner #RuralHealth #OpioidCrisis
Between 2017 and 2018, the number of rural hospitals operating at a loss rose from 40 to 44%. As more rural hospitals close, the number of rural communities at risk grows, and the number of treatment options for the #opioidcrisis in rural areas disappear #RuralHealth
Rural America lacks the necessary health care infrastructure for mental health and substance use treatment that is needed to effectively treat opioid use disorders #RuralHealth #OpioidCrisis https://t.co/FXfjpYU57O
In rural America, we have seen the devastating effects of the #opioidepidemic since the beginning of this crisis. While only 20% of Americans live in rural areas, a disproportionate number of rural communities are struggling with prescription opioids and heroin abuse #RuralHealth https://t.co/BGORcuJZCZ
As @HouseCommerce @EnergyCommerce considers yet another slate of legislation addressing the #opioidcrisis, and as both the House and Senate piece together packages to address the epidemic, we ask that they ensure that the needs of rural America are met #RuralHealth #Opioids
This morning, we're watching @HouseCommerce @EnergyCommerce markup another large slate of opioid bills #RuralHealth #OpioidEpidemic https://t.co/eFzWoHAqPz
Allowing hospital debt refinancing through existing @USDA programs supports rural communities and ensures local care. @RepArrington knows that the "heart of rural communities is access to quality health care" which is why he introduced this amendment #FarmBill #RuralHealth https://t.co/emfGgVn0iE
We want to thank @RepArrington for his amendment to the #FarmBill which would allow rural hospitals that are struggling to keep their doors open to better utilize the @USDA's Business and Industry and Community Facilities Loan Programs #RuralHealth https://t.co/M62O0cU2X8

NRHA Member Brad Gibbens, Deputy Director of @CRuralHealth at the @UofNorthDakota, had the opportunity to speak with @SenatorHeitkamp about #rural hospitals, including the need for alternative models and financing; social determinants of health; and global budgets #RuralHealth https://t.co/YLAP21eJ1j
Thank you to @SenatorHeitkamp and @SenTinaSmith, two Dem leaders of the Senate Rural Health Caucus for meeting with rural health leaders from both North Dakota and Minnesota May 12 at CHI St. Francis Health in Breckenridge, MN #RuralHealth https://t.co/cjBemnwqoF
David spoke of the need for a holistic approach: "The crisis has reached such a level that in isolation no single entity, and no single approach, can hope to impact it in a meaningful way. Presented strategies ranged from preventive, to clinical, to rehabilitative." #RuralHealth https://t.co/foKBiUESzp
Last week, NRHA Member David Gross, Director of @neahec, participated in a roundtable with @usdaRD to discuss community solutions in the opioid crisis. Learn more about the listening session and his work on the blog #RuralHealth #OpioidCrisis https://t.co/ZkBRBh2Ai0
RiverView Health in Minnesota, a Critical Access Hospital, is only able to maintain its Level 2 Trauma Center and keep its doors open because of #340B. Thank you @SenTinaSmith for recognizing the importance of this program for rural safety net hospitals #RuralHealth #Rural340B
14 of the 25 Maine hospitals receiving #340B have negative operating margins. The remaining hospitals that receive #340B dollars are using the funds in order to operate at a positive margin. Without the program, many would close #RuralHealth #Rural340B @SenatorCollins
The purpose of the program was to be able to "stretch scarce federal resources." It is clear that rural providers are using #340B exactly how it was intended when Congress created the program #RuralHealth #Rural340B
Hardin County General Hospital in Tennessee is currently able to provide oncology care as a result of #340B. The next closest hospital that provides oncology care is 1 hour and 15 minutes away and many patients travel to Vanderbilt 2.5-3 hours away #RuralHealth @SenAlexander
Kearney County Hospital in Kansas utilized the #340B program to provide care coordination and to provide unfunded care that prevents high cost interventions #RuralHealth #Rural340B @PatRoberts @JerryMoran
Childress Hospital in Texas is about 100 miles from another hospital that provides oncology care, for one patient the opening of the oncology infusion unit meant he did not have to travel 4 hours each way to receive chemotherapy #RuralHealth #Rural340B @JohnCornyn @SenTedCruz
For Lake Regional Health System in Missouri the #340B program allows them to set up primary care within their service area serving the elderly with substantial transportation challenges at a loss to the hospital #RuralHealth #Rural340B @RoyBlunt @clairecmc
Other facilities use #340B funds to staff their ED, to offset uncompensated care, or simply to keep their doors open to allow them to continue to serve their community, such as Cole Memorial Hospital in Pennsylvania @SenBobCasey #RuralHealth #Rural340B
Multiple hospitals, including Boone County Hospital in Iowa, are only able to staff their labor and delivery unit because of the #340B program, preventing women from needing to travel long distances to deliver a baby @ChuckGrassley @SenJoniErnst #RuralHealth
Thank you to @PattyMurray for recognizing a number of #rural facilities across Washington state that are using #340B just as the program was intended - to provide critical care to the most vulnerable and remote patient communities #RuralHealth
"340B is critical for safety net providers that care for patients and families with the greatest needs and fewest resources" - @PattyMurray #RuralHealth #340B
75% of participating hospitals use #340B savings just to keep their doors open. This is especially true for rural hospitals. In the fluctuating healthcare landscape, it is critical that we not forget the rural providers caring for the most vulnerable patients #RuralHealth
Over 90% of participating hospitals use #340B savings to offset costs of the under- and uninsured. Without these savings, 73% of hospitals will have to reduce staff, 71% will have to reduce pharmacy services, and 40% would have to close one or more clinics #RuralHealth
The #340B Program, as @SenAlexander explains, was designed to help low-income patients. In #rural America, providers serve a patient population that is on average older, sicker, and poorer than those in urban and suburban areas #RuralHealth
The #340B Program enables rural hospitals and providers to decrease costs for patients and provide necessary savings for the hospital, an ever-important measure when 44% of rural hospitals operate at a loss and 1/3 of all rural hospitals vulnerable to closure #RuralHealth
What are we watching this morning? @GOPHELP @HELPCmteDems discuss oversight of #340B - a program critical to providing resources for patients and providers in #rural America #RuralHealth https://t.co/hHewwjikXu
During #NRHAPolicy2018, rural received one of the biggest spending packages in years, but now the administration is calling for significant health care cuts to programs like #SCHIP and #CMMI. We need to keep fighting for rural #RuralHealth #NRHA2018
The President announces a blueprint TODAY to lower drug prices that may attack #340B. We need to remain vigilant to ensure that our rural hospitals that rely on this program to keep their doors open and provide critical care still have this resource #NRHA2018 #RuralHealth
On Tuesday, the House VA Committee advanced a major overhaul of the Veteran's Choice Act, which would alter eligibility criteria for veterans to access private-sector health care and encourage better #ruralveterans care #RuralHealth #NRHA2018
We are also looking for new opportunities to provide care for veterans in #rural America: 22 million veterans live in the US and almost 25% of these veterans live in rural communities #RuralHealth #NRHA2018
We are also looking forward to the Pennsylvania Global Budget Model, which enables systems to fully transform to emphasize prevention and chronic disease management #RuralHealth #NewModels #NRHA2018
And now we are looking to the future, such as with legislation like the Save Rural Hospitals Act from @daveloebsack and @RepSamGraves which creates a new future model: the Community Outpatient Hospital #RuralHealth #NRHA2018
But Congress IS starting to listen: @SenatorCollins opposed previous legislation that would have devastated Medicaid because it would have devastated rural hospitals in Maine #RuralHealth #NRHA2018
Then there's #sequestration which harms ALL rural health providers - rural hospitals have lost more than $320 million and 7,100 jobs in just one year from these cuts #RuralHealth #NRHA2018
Rural providers are also being forced to subsidize care: bad debt has increased by nearly 50% since the ACA was signed into law - bad debt cuts caused $3.8 billion in losses for #rural hospitals over the last 10 years #RuralHealth #NRHA2018
We know that these closures are going to continue and states that have not expanded #Medicaid are some of the most vulnerable #RuralHealth #NRHA2018 https://t.co/Hq3bm6C9cL
When hospitals are struggling, they shut down their obstetrics units first. More than 200 rural maternity wards closed between 2004 and 2014. Today 54% of rural counties are without hospital based OB #RuralHelath #NRHA2018
"It's hard to look at people in the face and tell them to pull themselves up by their bootstraps when they can't afford boots...We have seen 8 hospital closures in the past...if you want to see a small town not thrive, close its hospital" -Rebecca Jolley, @RuralHealthTN #NRHA2018
Rural hospitals are a key employer in these communities...if they can keep their doors open. 84 #rural hospitals have closed since 2010, and 673 are vulnerable to closure #RuralHealth #NRHA2018
"At the depths of the Great Recession, rural counties were shedding 200,000 jobs per year, rural unemployment stood at nearly 10%, and poverty rates reached heights unseen in decades. Many rural communities were ill-positioned to bounce back quickly" -Former USDA Sec Tom Vilsack https://t.co/8xqjWoQ0vU
We cannot separate the #opioidcrisis and the rise in substance use disorders in rural America from the poverty rates in these communities. In 1980, 70% of rural Americans living in poverty were working - today less than half of the rural poor are employed #RuralHealth #NRHA2018
As the House and Senate are marking up an enormous slate of bills... is there a rural focus? Will any of this legislation stop the crisis in rural America? Unfortunately, we're not seeing enough for rural communities from Congress #RuralHealth #OpioidCrisis #NRHA2018
Congress is leaning that the most vulnerable in our communities are at risk: every 15 minutes a baby is born with neonatal abstinence syndrome. The number of babies in the womb rose by more than 5 times in the last four years #RuralHealth #NRHA2018 #OpioidCrisis
The rural #opioid crisis also contributes to the rural-urban mortality divide. In rural America, there are 175 deaths every day, and the death rate is 45% higher in rural counties #RuralHealth #OpioidCrisis #NRHA2018
The rates of the five leading causes of death - heart disease, cancer, injuries, chronic respiratory disease, and stroke - are higher among rural Americans. Mortality is tied to income and geography #RuralHealth #NRHA2018 @CDCMMWR @CDCgov
The gap between rural and urban America continues to grow, and it is critical that we make politicians pay attention to the headlines. Workforce shortages increase, the urban-rural mortality divide expands, and provider resources are scarce #NRHA2018 #RuralHealth @ruralhealthinfo https://t.co/kwicDluBrI

Thank you to one of our Senate Rural Health Caucus Co-Chairs @SenatorHeitkamp for recognizing the difficulties that the rural economy is facing. Too many rural Americans are living in poverty, and too many rural Americans are unemployed #RebuildRural #RuralHealth
Rural hospitals are a critical part of the rural community and the backbone of the rural economy. 83 rural hospitals have closed since 2010, and 673 are vulnerable to closure. As more rural hospitals close, the number of rural communities at risk grows #RuralHealth #RebuildRural https://t.co/Julq7Rxxi7
From 2010 to 2014, rural areas saw more businesses close than open. In 1980, 70% of rural Americans living in poverty were employed, but today less than 50% of the rural poor are working #RuralHealth #RebuildRural
Rural America encompasses more than 90% of the nation’s land area, houses 46 million residents, and 20% of our nation’s population. Still, rural communities make up only 3% of job growth since the Great Recession #RuralHealth #RebuildRural @USDA @SenateAgGOP @SenateAgDems
As John Henderson, CEO of Childress Regional Hospital in Texas explains, “Hospitals, schools, churches. It’s the three-legged stool. If one of those falls down, you don’t have a town.” #RuralHealth #RebuildRural
In rural America, health care is the center of the community. It helps create and foster a sustainable and livable environment for rural Americans, and without health care, without a hospital, a rural community will crumble #RuralHealth #TheStateofRural @SenateAgDems @SenateAgGOP
This morning we're watching @SenateAgDems @SenateAgGOP hearing "The State of Rural America" with @USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue. We cannot talk about Rural America and its communities – their populations, economies, infrastructure -without discussing their health #RuralHealth
While we appreciate @SenAlexander and @PattyMurray's work on this crucial legislation, it still needs more for rural America. Providing "preference" to rural facilities is not enough. We need specific rural funding to fight the #opioidcrisis https://t.co/YFqrzJnsvj
The @dailyyonder reported that rural adults are significantly more likely to have untreated dental decay: 32.6% compared to 25.7% #OralHealth #NMHM18 #HealthEquity #RuralHealth @FamiliesUSA @Smile4Health @Teeth_Matter
Rural children are less likely than urban children to have received any dental care  in the previous year (23.4 v 22.3%) and rural adults ages 18-64 are nearly twice as likely to be missing teeth due to health issues #OralHealth #NMHM18 #HealthEquity #RuralHealth
Challenges to #rural oral health care include: provider shortages, high cost of care and low coverage under Medicaid/Medicare, lack of fluoridated community water, oral health literacy, and transportation #NMHM18 #OralHealth #HealthEquity @FamiliesUSA @Teeth_Matter @Smile4Health
"People living in rural areas face structural barriers when seeking dental care. These barriers... contribute to minimal expectations for receiving care and cause people to undervalue care." - NRHA Member Lisa Davis, PA Office of Rural Health #NMHM18 #oralhealth  #healthequity

The most important takeaway from the @HouseAgNews #2018FarmBill Markup so far? Those all over rural America, regardless of occupation, are struggling as the rural economy fights to recover from the Great Recession #RuralHealth #FarmBill
We urge the Agriculture Committee to create a grant and loan program in order to prevent further closures of rural hospitals and ensure continued community based care for small rural and remote communities #RuralHealth #FarmBill @HouseAgNews @SenateAgGOP @SenateAgDems @usdaRD
This emergency funding would be available for hospitals facing eminent closure. @USDA has experience with keeping struggling hospitals from closing through their rural development program, which is at times faced with borrows struggling to pay back their loans #RuralHealth
NRHA would like @HouseAgNews to consider the creation of an emergency hospital fund under Title VI, Temporary Prioritization of Rural Health Assistance. When a rural area is faced with a hospital closure the community often looks for preventative resources #RuralHealth #FarmBill
While we appreciate the recognition that these programs are essential in addressing an emergency, we know that rural America is in the midst of a rural hospital closure crisis. There already IS an emergency, and rural America needs our help now #RuralHealth #FarmBill
Title VI, Rural Infrastructure and Economic Development, is the section of the #FarmBill that includes @USDA funding for rural health programs. The 2018 bill allows the USDA Secretary to prioritize funding for rural health in the case of an emergency #RuralHealth https://t.co/4pnh9QI3wF
While the #2018FarmBill provides funding for rural communities, more is necessary to support our economy and health.

Vote No on the BBA which would cause cuts to programs that are critical for the health and economy of rural areas. This legislation would only worsen the rural hospital closure crisis and put our most vulnerable communities at greater risk #RuralHealth #BalancedBudgetAmendment https://t.co/smRr0ZfzPx
We cannot afford to let the #BalancedBudgetAmendment pass the House today. While ensuring the economic security of our future is important, we cannot do so at the expense of our rural providers #RuralHealth
Sequestration has rapidly expedited the closure crisis. Rural hospitals lose an average of $150,000 annually as a result of the 2% cut imposed under the sequester. We have lost a total of 7,122 jobs and $317,769,135. Any broad cut places rural providers at risk #RuralHealth
44% of rural hospitals operate at a loss, with 30% operating below -3% margin. According to MedPAC, the median operating loss for rural hospitals is 6%, while the median profit margin for urban hospitals is 7% #RuralHealth #BalancedBudgetAmendment
Across the nation, rural hospitals absorb a combined $318 mil in annual revenue cuts due to sequestration. For 29 rural hospitals, this was the difference between operating in the black or the red. The median rural hospital loses $71,000 annually from the sequester #RuralHealth
If the #BalancedBudgetAmendment were to pass, it would force cuts in critical programs. As our members know, the rural hospital closure crisis continues to grow, a crisis that has only been accelerated by previous restraints enacted under the Budget Control Act #RuralHealth
This evening, the House is expected to vote on H.J. Res. 2, the Balanced Budget Amendment, which would prevent Congress from spending more than the government receives each year #VoteNoOnBBA #BalancedBudgetAmendment
More from yesterday's roundtable with Ways and Means. NRHA Member @LeslieLmarsh and NRHA Regulatory Counsel Diane Calmus discuss policy changes CMS can make in order to improve access to care and reduce undue burdens on small rural providers #RuralHealth	https://t.co/d7jhOXOs5S
Thank you to one of our strong rural advocates @RepAdrianSmith for bringing attention to the challenges rural Nebraskans face in providing and accessing health care #RuralHealth #RedTapeRelief https://t.co/IAnlR9mvQW
.@RepAdrianSmith asked about exclusive use, and @LeslieLmarsh explained that individuals will not receive care if specialists are not present in the community. It's an access to care issue - many don't have the ability to go to an urban center for care #RuralHealth #RedTapeRelief
83 rural hospitals have closed since 2010, and 673 are vulnerable to closure. NRHA has identified regulatory concerns that could immediately be addressed by @CMSGov to improve access to care and reduce undue burdens placed on small rural providers #RuralHealth #RedTapeRelief
As the rural hospital closure crisis continues to escalate, rolling back regulations that are burdensome and unnecessary can help facilities better provide quality, affordable care #RuralHealth #RedTapeRelief
Direct supervision is a real issue for rural hospitals as well - there are no quality concerns with general supervision and it can help to improve access in small remote communities #RuralHealth #RedTapeRelief
An additional issue that @LeslieLmarsh's CAH must deal with is the 96 hour condition of payment rule. Physicians cannot admit a patient if they don't believe they can provide care in this period of time. This prevents them from providing critical care #RuralHealth #RedTapeRelief
One key issue Lexington Regional faces is the exclusive use rule - it is asking for a rebuild of facilities that is not possible for small rural providers. It is an enormously costly endeavor, but these specialty services are critical #RuralHealth #RedTapeRelief
Even though the facility is only a 25 bed Critical Access Hospital, it still has to deal with many of the same regulations as a large facility #RuralHealth #RedTapeRelief
Lexington Regional is an economic provider for the community, injecting $30 million into the area annually. Without the hospital, the community's infrastructure would crumble #RuralHealth

We need proportional distribution of funding to ensure that the states hardest hit by the opioid epidemic have an opportunity to recover. The current formula does not sufficiently consider the scope of the crisis and favors larger states #RuralHealth #OpioidCrisis
West Virginia has the highest overdose death rate in the US, but only received $5.8 million. Second-ranked New Hampshire was given $3.1 million...but California and Texas received the most funding even though they had some of the lowest overdose death rates in the US #RuralHealth
In the 21st Century Cures legislation, passed in 2016, Congress authorized $1 billion in funding for the next 2 years to combat the #opioidepidemic. Currently, this funding is being allocated to the states based on the mortality rate and the size of each state #RuralHealth
As we continue our work on the Opioid Crisis Response Act, we need to ensure proportional distribution of funding to the most impacted states. Thank you @SenatorHassan for your work on this specific issue which is critical for our rural communities #RuralHealth #OpioidCrisis
Thank you @lisamurkowski for asking about Substance Use Disorders (SUD) across our country beyond opioids and heroin. We have seen increased rates of meth and alcohol abuse in our rural communities, and we cannot ignore rising rates of addiction of all kinds #RuralHealth #Opioids
Thank you for noting the need to address the economic challenges and unemployment of rural communities in fighting the opioid crisis @SenDougJones. We need a holistic approach to rebuild rural communities and stop the spread of SUD in rural America #RuralHealth #OpioidCrisis
The Opioid Crisis Response Act works to improve the regulations under @DEAHQ to expand access to telemedicine. The legislation would allow community mental health and addiction treatment centers to register with the DEA to treat patients using telemedicine #RuralHealth #Opioids
As @SenPatRoberts notes, those in Southeast Kansas cannot even access a methadone clinic in the state - they're forced to travel to Missouri to receive Medication Assisted Treatment. Telemedicine can reduce travel times and increase access to critical care #RuralHealth #Opioids
Telemedicine provides the opportunity for care in otherwise underserved communities. 77% of rural communities are Health Professional Shortage Areas and in 55% of all US counties, most of which are rural, there are no psychologists, psychiatrists or social workers #RuralHealth
Thank you to @SenPatRoberts and @SenatorHeitkamp for their work on legislation that utilizes telemedicine to help treat the #OpioidCrisis in #rural communities. Our Senate Rural Health Caucus Co-Chairs are constant advocates for our most vulnerable communities #RuralHealth
As Rebecca Crowder, Director of @LilysPlaceWV explained at #NRHAPolicy2018, babies born with NAS require specialized care that often cannot be provided in a hospital. The growth of facilities similar to Lily's Place could be made possible by the CRIB Act #RuralHealth #Opioids

Lack of economic opportunity in rural America effects health outcomes. Poverty and health are inextricably linked - the result of a multitude of factors both directly related to health care (access to providers) and impacting health (access to healthy foods) #NMHM18 #RuralHealth

Thank you to @boblatta for noting the key effects that the #opioidcrisis has had on families in #rural Ohio. In Ohio, there were 5,256 drug-overdose deaths statewide from June 2016 to June 2017 - a 43.9% increase from the previous 12-month period #RuralHealth
Today and tomorrow @HouseCommerce @EnergyCommerce is holding a hearing on "COMBATING THE OPIOID CRISIS: PREVENTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH SOLUTIONS." Watch what's happening here: https://t.co/3suOKz8tFf #OpioidCrisis #RuralHealth

Are you a rural facility or provider with a story about how you've used #340B in your community to provide critical care? We want to hear your story. Tweet or send us a message with your story so we can share it here and with the Hill! #Rural340B #RuralHealth
71 hospitals in @SenatorBaldwin's home state of Wisconsin rely on the #340B program. Thanks to 340B, one rural WI hospital has been able to expand a remote dispensing site in a remote community that otherwise would not have a pharmacy #Rural340B #RuralHealth
In Indiana, #340B helps hospitals and providers serving the state's most vulnerable populations @SenToddYoung #Rural340B #RuralHealth
18% of rural populations are those 65 and older, and 19% of rural Americans are living in poverty. Medicaid covers 21% of rural Americans (16% of urban) and over 45% of patients in rural hospitals are Medicare beneficiaries (41% in urban.) #Rural340B #RuralHealth #340B https://t.co/TNhDK3oxZh
78% of Critical Access Hospitals rely on #340B to provide essential care to their rural and remote communities #Rural340B #RuralHealth https://t.co/CGG2Y4M37q
The #340B program was created to help safety net providers stretch scarce resources and provide for the disproportionate number of Medicare, Medicaid, under- and uninsured patients. Rural providers certainly fit the description of the program's original intent #Rural340B
In Virginia, 22 hospitals use #340B, as well as many other providers. Riverside Health Systems provides care to rural areas of the state where patients would otherwise have to travel hours for care. Thank you to @timkaine for recognizing the work they do #Rural340B #RuralHealth
#340B helps reduce costs for rural hospitals and health centers – for many, the program has provided an opportunity for innovation to ensure communities are adequately served. Thank you @SenTinaSmith for recognizing how important this program is to rural #Rural340B #RuralHealth
In New Hampshire there are 13 hospitals that use #340B, like rural Dartmouth Hitchcock, which created $172 million in community benefits with 340B, including work to fight the opioid epidemic. Thank you @SenatorHassan for asking about the role of 340B in rural America #Rural340B
The rural health safety net is already at risk: since 2010, 83 rural hospitals have closed and 674 are vulnerable to closure. This represents almost 37% of rural hospitals. #340B allows rural hospitals to stay open #Rural340B #RuralHealth https://t.co/OSpj4Kqiwu
#340B doesn't just support rural hospitals in our communities. As Sue Veer, President And Chief Executive Officer of Carolina Health Centers, explains, the program allows community health centers to provide for vulnerable rural areas as well #Rural340B #RuralHealth
In rural America, supportive programs, like the #340B Drug Pricing Program, are crucial for saving rural hospitals and facilities in the fluctuating health care landscape #Rural340B #RuralHealth https://t.co/H92O0szJBW
.@SenAlexander explains that hospitals use #340B savings to cover the costs of uncompensated care they provide. Uncompensated care is a growing issue in the rural health safety net, yet rural providers must continue caring for patients that have few or no other options #Rural340B
#340B can be used in working to treat the opioid epidemic which is critical to rural patients and providers. Thank you @PattyMurray for opening today's hearing by discussing the positive and innovative ways small #rural communities use this program #Rural340B #RuralHealth
What are we watching this morning? @HELPCmteDems @GOPHELP host a hearing on Perspectives on the #340B Program #Rural340B https://t.co/7glWSex1e2
Although Hardin Medical Center in Tennessee serves a challenging patient population facing a great deal of poverty, they do not turn any patients away from their oncology practice because “that would be a death sentence.” #Rural340B #RuralHealth #340B https://t.co/SanuXZt3yc
NRHA is proud to support the STRESS Act which will provide critical resources to farmers in need #RuralHealth https://t.co/saWEKJfUfF
This epidemic continues to tear through our communities. We are so grateful that one of our amazing members, Lisa Davis, was able to join this round table to speak about the challenges facing rural Pennsylvanians #OpioidCrisis #RuralHealth https://t.co/3ZwJIND9bn
Many policy decisions have negatively impacted rural hospitals, but programs like #340B that enable rural providers to provide low-cost care to patients are invaluable to the sustainability of the rural safety net #Rural340B #RuralHealth
Imagine driving four hours to receive chemotherapy while battling cancer. Childress Hospital in Texas is about 100 miles from another hospital that provides oncology care, but because of #340B it can provide a local oncology infusion unit #Rural340B #RuralHealth https://t.co/semXO1l2Sa
Facilities like Neshoba General in Mississippi use innovative #340B ideas to reduce costs: the majority of the patients served in their infusion center receive IV antibiotics there instead of in an inpatient setting decreasing Medicaid and Medicare costs #Rural340B https://t.co/xstNtUuttw
For some, the #340B program allows them to set up primary care so that the older, sicker, poorer populations of rural America don't have to face significant travel barriers for care, like Lake Regional Health System in Missouri #Rural340B #RuralHealth https://t.co/19pHP3rpc7
Other facilities use #340B funds to keep their doors open to provide local community care. In fact, 75% of participating hospitals use 340B savings just to keep their doors open #Rural340B #RuralHealth #SaveRural https://t.co/zhlSD9Qsbm
What does #340B look like in rural America? While more than half of rural counties have no hospital-based obstetrics services, Boone County Hospital in Iowa is able to keep their labor and delivery unit open because of this program #Rural340B #RuralHealth #DeliveringRuralBabies https://t.co/HRzcot3JIP

Models for proportional funding already exist in S. 2125 The Targeted Opioid Formula Act and H.R. 4190 The Federal Opioid Response Fairness Act. Most other proposals are population based and hard-hit areas such as Appalachia and the Midwest don't receive needed funds #RuralHealth
To make CARA 2.0 work for rural America, we need to include rural set asides to ensure money is going to communities hit the hardest and especially for treatment related monies to go to communities that doesn’t already have treatment resources #OpioidEpidemic #RuralHealth
The original #CARA addressed some of the needs of rural communities, acknowledging that this epidemic had most impacted them. Any legislation working to stop the spread of opioids must acknowledge and address the specific needs of rural America #OpioidEpidemic #RuralHealth

Rural Americans are farther away from emergency care and treatment options, especially for mental health and substance abuse. Every second counts  #OpioidEpidemic #RuralHealth https://t.co/Tpil9blKaz
The #opioid crisis is creating greater demands on health care services in rural America that are already spread incredibly thin. 83 rural hospitals have closed since 2010, leaving millions of rural Americans without timely local access to care #OpioidEpidemic #RuralHealth https://t.co/foL70777LP
According to @CDCgov, rural Americans are more vulnerable to prescription painkiller abuse and overdoses, and the rate of opioid-related overdose deaths in non-metro counties is 45% higher than in metro counties #RuralHealth #OpioidEpidemic https://t.co/Bb3Fy5bo4F
The #opioid crisis has only increased the growing rural-urban health gap.  While only 20% of Americans live in rural areas, a disproportionate number of rural communities are struggling with prescription opioids and heroin abuse #RuralHealth #OpioidEpidemic
45% of rural counties had no hospital obstetric services between 2004 and 2014, and an additional 9% lost all their services during the study period. After 2014, just 46% of rural counties in the United States had hospital-based obstetric services #DeliveringRuralBabies https://t.co/CF4Y7TrgrC

Geographic maldistribution of providers has created a maternity care shortage in rural America. The Improving Access to Maternity Care Act would improve this issue by creating maternity health professional target areas #DeliveringRuralBabies #MaternityCareShortages
The most vulnerable communities are the most likely to be without maternity care: low-income, health care shortage areas, minority populations, and the most remote locations #DeliveringRuralBabies #MaternityCareShortages https://t.co/yz9yLLT15H
The loss of maternity care in rural America is the result of multiple factors including: workforce shortages, low birth volumes, and stingy Medicaid programs #DeliveringRuralBabies #MaternityCareShortages
When distance to maternity care is correlated with outcomes, this care shortage has a devastating effect. Rural babies are being born outside of hospitals or in hospitals without obstetrics care, and infant mortality rates are rising #DeliveringRuralBabies #MaternityCareShortages https://t.co/x3Pcs0fGOZ
The number of rural hospitals without obstetrics care is growing at an alarming rate, placing expecting mothers at risk. From 1985 to 2002, the number of rural hospitals without obstetrics grew from 24% to 44%, and today that number has climbed over 50% #DeliveringRuralBabies

Health care infrastructure is more than just buildings and roads: it is the nurses, doctors, and other providers that care for patients; it’s telehealth services that localize specialty care; and it is community resources that provide jobs and opportunities #RebuildRural
Especially at a time when we are trying to move control of critical policies from the federal to the state level, we cannot afford to limit our governors and ourselves with a narrow view of what comprises rural infrastructure #RebuildRural #RuralHealth
We also appreciate that the Administration recognizes the role that our governors can play in ensuring that funds are appropriately directed. That being said, final legislation must allow state officials to allocate funds to health care infrastructure investments #RebuildRural
We need investments in rural infrastructure, and especially in health care, to ensure the future of our rural communities, and we are encouraged to see President Trump’s commitment to rural infrastructure in the outline of this proposed plan #RebuildRural #RuralHealth
If all 674 vulnerable hospitals close, we will lose 99,000 direct health care jobs, 137,000 community jobs, and $277 billion in GDP. Per-Capita annual income in rural communities will decrease by $703, while rural unemployment would increase by 1.6 percentage points #RebuildRural
In most rural communities, the hospital is the first or second largest employer, but only if the hospital can stay open. 44% of rural hospitals operate at a loss and 30% operate below a -3% margin. 83 rural hospitals have closed since 2010, and 674 are vulnerable #RebuildRural
Rural communities have not recovered from the Great Recession: 200,000 jobs are still lost annually in rural communities, and as a result, 749 rural counties experience increasing unemployment #RebuildRural #RuralHealth
It is essential that we build rural priorities into this massive investment in our nation’s future, and it is even more important that we recognize the special role that health care plays in our country’s infrastructure #RebuildRural #RuralHealth

Thank you to @RepJimRenacci for discussing the critical need to battle the opioid epidemic in Ohio and across the country. Addressing the roots of this crisis can do so much to prevent its growth and we look forward to seeing @HHSGov work on this issue #RuralHealth @SecAzar
We greatly appreciate @RepRonKind's statement advocating for rural providers during W&amp;M hearing. There are 2 trillion Medicaid and Medicare cuts in this proposed budget, and yet we've lost 83 rural hospitals in the last decade. These cuts could kill rural facilities #SaveRural
We look forward to seeing the work that @SecAzar will do to fight the opioid crisis. Thank you @RepErikPaulsen for asking the Secretary about alternative prescribing practices and treatment options to reduce opioid use #RuralHealth #OpioidEpidemic
Small providers suffer under mountains of regulations. Thank you @RepLynnJenkins for asking @SecAzar about the difficulties these regulations create, and we appreciate the Secretary's commitment at @HHSGov and @CMSGov to reduce these burdens on small rural hospitals #RuralHealth
Thank you @RepAdrianSmith for being a consistent advocate for #rural. In W&amp;M hearing, Smith just asked @SecAzar about the CAH 96-Hour Rule and the Bay State Boondoggle. We hope to work to better educate @HHSGov Secretary Azar on the issues that are important to rural America.

Republicans are Red, Democrats are Blue, but rural health is an issue we can all commit to #healthpolicyvalentines #RuralHealth
Our CEO @Amorganrural is getting in on #healthpolicyvalentines! Do you have a rural health valentine to share? #RebuildRural https://t.co/SP6hRXbtjf
We could not be happier to see this huge investment in our rural areas, and we appreciate that the Administration recognizes the needs of struggling rural communities. We are excited to release our health care infrastructure plan soon! #RebuildRural

A constant advocate for rural Alaskans, @SenDanSullivan talks about how Trump's infrastructure plan could help rural states #RebuildRural https://t.co/O41qSK6lrM
The Administration and Congress have pledged to support vulnerable rural communities. At first glance, this budget would instead devastate rural patients and providers. We need to work together to ensure that Washington hears the voice of rural on this proposed plan #RuralHealth
The Administration is asking Congress to roll back the ACA's Medicaid expansion, instead supporting state block grants. This would be devastating for rural hospitals: Recent studies show that Medicaid expansion states have significantly less rural hospital closures #RuralHealth
An update from @politico shows that Trump's 2019 budget proposal hopes to "modify hospital payments for uncompensated care," which it believes would save $70 billion. It also asks for reforms for Medicare bad debt coverage which it hopes would save $37 billion #RuralHealth
BREAKING NEWS from our friends @politico: President Trump's proposed budget will devastate Medicaid and Medicare. Read more here: https://t.co/AsYXXLPSWY
We have an incredible opportunity in the coming weeks and months to invest in the future of rural America. We hope that the action we saw from Congress this week will continue, and we will soon be able to work together to rebuild our rural communities #RebuildRural #RuralHealth
Health care infrastructure is more than just buildings and roads: it is the nurses, doctors, and other providers that care for patients; it’s telehealth services that localize specialty care; and it is community resources that provide jobs and opportunities #RebuildRural
It is essential that we build rural priorities into Congress and the President's massive investment in our nation’s future, and it is even more important that we recognize the special role that health care plays in our country’s infrastructure #RebuildRural #RuralHealth
Now that Congress has acted on its commitment to our most vulnerable populations, rural facilities and providers can get back to work with the certainty they need. Now we can finally turn to other priorities to improve delivery and access to care in #rural America #RebuildRural
For months, Congress has said they hear our #rural voice. Finally, we saw action. It is no coincidence that this legislation passed the same week that more than 400 rural advocates joined us here in Washington, D.C. for the 29th Annual Rural Health Policy Institute #RuralHealth
On Friday, Congress finally acted on their promise to support #rural facilities. They passed a CR with a 2-year extension for Community Health Centers, Medicare Dependent Hospitals, Low-Volume Hospital adjustments, rural ambulance payments, and Medicare Therapy Caps #RuralHealth
Last week, we came together in D.C. and Congress finally renewed its commitment to rural Americans. Now, as President Trump sends his budget requests to Congress and details of his infrastructure plan are released, we look to what's next #RuralHealth https://t.co/OyxKtdrswD

Greater access to care, not less, is the solution to improve the troubling health care outcomes in rural America.  A broad call for less CAHs and fewer rural hospitals will mean increased barriers to care for our rural communities most in need of local access to care #RuralHealth
However, the report ignores the government's role in creating instability in the #rural health care delivery system by imposing cut after cut in Medicare and Medicaid. We believe that the most cost effective method of ensuring care for rural is to stop reimbursement payment cuts.
The report finds that adjustments need to be made to fit the health care needs of rural communities. We agree, and NRHA has led the way in advancing new rural payment models #ruralhealth

When a CAH fills its 25 beds, it has no choice but to turn away patients, transfer them to another location, or consider removing them from beds. Congress and the Administration can provide flexibility and resources for rural facilities facing an outbreak #fluseason #ruralhealth
Margaret Mary Health, a #CAH in Batesville, IN, has been running at capacity for over a week, due almost entirely to the flu outbreak. Many CAHs have additional capacity but are constrained by the 25 bed limit. Providing flexibility for CAHs could save lives #ruralhealth
CAHs stretch a small number of resources to care for their communities and are often the only point of care for individuals in #rural America, so what happens when the area a CAH services is hit with a #fluoutbreak? #ruralhealth #fluseason
1,330 Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) operate across #rural America, providing essential access for underserved communities. CAHs are equipped to handle a flu outbreak but inflexible red tape prevents them from caring for their community #fluseason #ruralhealth
The older, sicker, poorer populations of #rural America are more susceptible to the flu, and less likely to have access to care. They're more likely to face physical boundaries (distance and lack of transportation) and to be uninsured or underinsured #ruralhealth #fluseason

We needed Congress to reauthorize Rural Medicare Extenders in 2017. Now we need to demand that they are reauthorized at the beginning of 2018. Rural hospitals are closing, obstetrics units are shuttering even more quickly, and Congress needs to act #SaveRural
Congress left town at the end of 2017 and left rural behind. Even though yet another rural hospital is on the verge of closing, Congress did not take the time to reauthorize crucial Rural Medicare Extenders #ruralhealth
Rural communities are on average older, sicker, and poorer than urban and suburban areas. The presence of a local hospital can change that for the better, but the loss of a hospital can devastate these communities even more #ruralhealth #SaveRural #ruralhospitals https://t.co/sAIXYhIFlR

Reauthorize #RuralMedicareExtenders in a clean bill that also includes an extension of #CHIP and #CHCs. Congress needs to act on these program before times run out #RuralHealth
Some proposals for end of the year funding reauthorize #CHIP and #CHCs while forgetting about rural hospitals. This is also unacceptable – we need one all-encompassing package to save rural communities #RuralHealth
Proposals to alter the Low Volume Hospital adjustment, like in the Senate Finance bill, or cut the Critical Access Hospital swing-bed program, like in the House Ways and Means bill, are unacceptable. We cannot provide aid to some rural hospitals at the cost of others #RuralHealth
Without action, Medicare Dependent Hospitals and rural hospitals reliant on Low Volume Hospital adjustments will have to close their doors; children and expecting mothers will lose insurance; and community health centers will see reductions of up to 70% in funds #RuralHealth
There are only 11 more days left in 2017. There are only 2 more full days left until the government shuts down. There have been 81 days since Congress irresponsibly let funding for Rural Medicare Extenders, CHIP, and Community Health Centers expire #RuralHealth
Late last night, the Senate also passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It will return to the House today for one final vote because of one technical change, and then it will head to the President's desk #TaxReform
The House just passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, sweeping #tax reform legislation that may end up being harmful to rural Americans. Tonight the Senate will vote on this legislation.
Today, the House will vote on the tax reform bill, a bill that will increase the deficit by about $1.5 trillion. Without Congressional intervention, this deficit increase will cause a sequester and devastating cuts to Medicare #TaxReform

Under the proposed #TaxCutsandJobsAct, Congress would be forced to cut $136 billion, including $25 billion from #Medicare, in mandatory spending programs next year #TaxReform
That being said, we have serious concerns that mandatory spending cuts harmful to rural America may still be on the horizon. Without a permanent spending bill by mid-January, Congress will be forced into another round of sequestration #TaxReform #TaxCutsandJobsAct
Just a month ago, we announced that tax-exempt financing (a crucial tool for our non-profit hospitals) was at serious risk in the House #taxreform bill. We are happy to see that this provision has been removed from the final legislation https://t.co/u8dxMCzu7O
The House and Senate are expected to vote this week on both another government funding bill and the final version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act #TaxReform #GovernmentShutdownn
@MontanaStandard Montana’s community health centers received $35.5 million in FY17 federal funds to serve vulnerable, underserved and rural communities. Last year 1 in 10 Montanans relied on CHCs for primary care, and most of those patients are below poverty level #RuralHealth
In this article from @MontanaStandard, we see how states are impacted by this irresponsible lack of action #CHCs #RuralHealth https://t.co/rfqNvOABgq
Congress still has not reauthorized funding for Community Health Centers... These federally subsidized, locally directed clinics deliver lower cost and high quality, stretching every dollar they receive from patients and taxpayers #CHCs #RuralHealth
CHIP provides essential insurance to children of low-income families and expecting mothers, but if there is no local hospital for these individuals to receive care from, then the costs of travel and care escalate quickly #RuralHealth #CHIP #MedicareExtenders
We applaud appropriators for recognizing these essential programs, but we cannot help some and forget about others. #RuralExtenders must be included in the #CHIP and #CHC package #RuralHealth
@maggie_elehwany @modrnhealthcr Just last night, House appropriators released language funding the government through January 19th and reauthorizing funding for the CHIP program for 5 years and Community Health Centers for 2 years...but where are #RuralMedicareExtenders?

The goal of #21stCenturyCures was to expand and provide better health coverage for all Americans, and several provisions focused on expanded telehealth services, rural providers, and substance abuse and mental health reforms #RuralHealth

@CMSGov Some of these states have already begun to send parents letters informing them when their children will lose coverage on the program. Some of these states have already run out of funds. This change is not enough #FundCHIP
The funding bill passed last week included a technical change that would allow @CMSGov to send funds to state #CHIP programs that are due to run out of money at the end of the year #FundCHIP
Rural children and families rely on #CHIP for affordable care today more than they ever have before. Today, 45% of rural children are covered under Medicaid and CHIP #FundCHIP #SaveRural
While the House passed a bill that would fund both CHIP and CHCs, the Senate has not taken up similar legislation. We ask that Congress include CHC and CHIP funding in any end of the year budget deal #CHIP #CHCCliff #SaveRural
There are currently more than 1,400 community health centers across the country that provide care to more than 25 million Americans - Most are based in rural America, where care options are limited #SaveRural #CHCCliff
Like so many other programs essential to the health of rural America, the funding for Community Health Centers (CHCs) ran out on September 30th, and has not yet been renewed #CHCCliff #SaveRural
The Children’s Health Insurance (CHIP) program, Rural Medicare Extenders, and Community Health Centers need Congress to act now to reauthorize their funding and insure that our most vulnerable populations have the resources they need #SaveRural
Last week, Congress passed a short term funding bill, narrowly averting a government shutdown… at least for the next 2 weeks. But in the bill, lawmakers forgot the needs of rural Americans who are struggling bc programs crucial to their communities expired Oct 1 #SaveRural

We can’t make good decisions if we are using bad data. At a time when the rural hospital closure crisis continues to escalate, when rural Americans are dying at higher rates, when the opioid crisis is ravaging our communities, we cannot afford to make bad decisions #SaveRural
Unfortunately, the original press release from @WaysandMeansGOP cited the fatally flawed OIG Report in its decision making for using CAH swing-beds as a pay-for in funding these other critically important programs #SaveRural #SwingBeds
The nonpartisan @uncsheps found that the flawed methodology of the OIG report over-estimates the potential Medicare savings by removing swing beds from cost-based reimbursement #SwingBeds #SaveRural
Then CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner, sharply disagreed with the OIG's findings, “The report does not take into account the burden on patients on being treated farther from home and family, and being transferred in an ambulance to a new facility…" #SaveRural #SwingBeds
What do experts say about the 2015 OIG report on Critical Access Hospital Swing beds? @ahahospitals senior associate director, Priya Bathija, said: “The report demonstrates an unfortunate lack of understanding of how healthcare is delivered in rural communities." #SaveRural

Our own VP of Govt Affairs, @maggie_elehwany, explains, "It's little irresponsible of Congress to let the extenders expire...We're in the middle of a rural hospital closure crisis that is escalating. These payments are so critically important."
Without #RuralExtenders, many rural hospitals may be forced to close their doors, and millions of patients will lose care options https://t.co/WsFBPdFmS2
The #CHIP program isn't the only thing Congress let expire on October 1st. Crucial Medicare Extenders, like the low volume hospital program, Medicare Dependent Hospital payments, rural ambulance services, and many more are in desperate need of Congressional action #RuralExtenders
What happens when expecting mothers and their children lose #CHIP coverage? Congress must act to reauthorize funding for this program soon, or millions of families will find out #FundCHIP
The farther women need to travel for obstetrics, the more likely their babies are to need time in neonatal intensive care units #SaveRural
A recent study by @UMNRHRC found that more than half of the nation’s rural counties no longer have hospital obstetric services, and 9%  lost those services between 2004 and 2014 #SaveRural
Cuts to Medicaid and CHIP only hurt rural hospitals and make it even harder for them to keep their doors open. Obstetrics are high cost, low-volume services and are often the first thing a hospital cuts when its struggling #SaveRural #FundCHIP
Dr. Stephan Schomer, interim CEO of Washington County Hospitals and Clinics, said "It was a difficult decision...They’ve had births there for 105 years, but it really came down to resources and how we can best serve the people in the community." #SaveRural #FundCHIP
Just this week, Washington County Hospital in Iowa announced that it will be closing its obstetrics unit #SaveRural #FundCHIP  https://t.co/vynJPaPn66
And Congress is letting this happen while obstetrics units and hospitals are struggling to keep their doors open to provide care for mothers and children #FundCHIP #CHIP #SaveRural
CHIP offers affordable coverage for pregnant women, removing barriers to pregnancy services and prenatal care that are essential for ensuring the health of children from birth #CHIP #FundCHIP
CHIP covers 9 million children every year, but it also covers 370,000 pregnant women annually #CHIP #FundCHIP
Colorado and Virginia have announced that they will send letters to CHIP beneficiaries soon to alert them to the end of the program on Jan 31 #FundCHIP #CHIP
Not all states can increase funding like MN and OR. By state law, some  are required to shut down their CHIP programs if federal funding disappears #FundCHIP #CHIP
In Oregon, @OregonGovBrown said that she is ready to spend $35 million in state funds to keep CHIP running when it runs out of federal funds as expected in December #FundCHIP #CHIP
The state of Minnesota has ALREADY run out of federal dollars for its CHIP fund this month, requiring the state to contribute more of its own resources to keep the health plan in operation #FundCHIP #CHIP
5 states will run out of funding before the end of December leaving thousands of children without insurance #CHIP #FundCHIP
Today is the 58th day since CHIP funding expired. Many states are now making plans for the program when it completely runs out of money @thehill #CHIP #ReauthorizeCHIP https://t.co/mYTeQ65KIX
"One hospital is only able to staff their labor and delivery unit because of the 340B program...Other facilities use #340B funds to staff their ED, to offset uncompensated care, or simply to keep their doors open to allow them to continue to serve their community" - @Amorganrural

At this rate, 25% of rural hospitals will have to close their doors in the next 10 years, causing 1.7 million patients to lose access to care, 99,000 health care and 137,000 community jobs to be lost, and a $277 billion loss to GDP #SaveRural

As we continue to debate the future of health care in our country, the Save Rural Hospitals Act and the hospital closure crisis must be a part of the conversation #SaveRural #PowerofRural
The Save Rural Hospitals Act will stabilize rural hospitals, create rural Medicare beneficiary equity, implement regulatory relief, and provide an innovative model for rural hospitals #SaveRural #PowerofRural
“We applaud @RepSamGraves and @daveloebsack for reintroducing the Save Rural Hospitals Act &amp; call for Congress to quickly pass this comprehensive legislation to save rural hospitals &amp; ensure emergency access to care for rural patients across the nation.” - NRHA CEO @Amorganrural
“The NRHA has continuously called on Congress to stabilize rural hospitals by stopping the many cuts in Medicare that are causing rural closures and providing common-sense regulatory relief,” says NRHA CEO @Amorganrural #SaveRural #PowerofRural
Save Rural Hospitals Act cosponsor @daveloebsack said, “Rural hospitals are the cornerstone of ensuring patients have access to high quality care and are a major contributor to the local economy, creating jobs in the hospital and the community." #SaveRural #PowerofRural #NRHD
Cosponsor of the Save Rural Hospitals Act, @RepSamGraves said, “This bill shines a light on the rural health crisis in MO &amp; across the country...If we accept this reality... rural hospitals will continue to close, leaving 1000s w/o access to health care" #SaveRural #PowerofRural
The Save Rural Hospitals Act will provide rural hospitals with financial and regulatory relief to allow them to stay open and care for rural residents who are older, sicker, and poorer than those in urban counties #SaveRural  #PowerofRural #hospitalclosurecrisis
On National Rural Health Day, we also want to talk about our Save Rural Hospitals Act, H.R. 2957 #SaveRuralHospitals #SaveRural #PowerofRural https://t.co/y6W4jqJvi6
The resolution from @RepLynnJenkins @PeterWelch @cathymcmorris @RepRonKind recognizes the crisis rural America is facing and recognizes that access to hospitals and other providers  is essential to the survival and success of communities #PowerofRural #NRHD #SaveRural
At this rate, 25% of rural hospitals will have shut down in the next 10 years and medical deserts are appearing across rural America, leaving many of our nation’s most vulnerable populations without timely access to care #PowerofRural #ruralhospitalclosure #closurecrisis #NRHD
Because of the closure of these 82 rural hospitals, 99,000 health care jobs have been lost and 137,000 community jobs have been lost #PowerofRural #ruralhospitalclosure #closurecrisis #NRHD
Rural hospitals and other providers are facing a growing closure crisis: 82 rural hospitals have closed since 2010 and 673 rural hospitals are in severe financial crisis, representing one-third of the rural hospitals in the United States #PowerofRural #NRHD
According to @HHSGov , “rural areas have higher rates of poverty, chronic disease, and uninsurance, and millions of rural Americans have limited access to a primary care provider” #PowerofRural #NRHD
More than 60,000,000 individuals in rural areas of the United States rely on rural hospitals and other providers as critical access points to health care #PowerofRural #NRHD

We need proportional distribution of funding to save our rural populations hit hardest by the opioid epidemic #opioidcrisis #saverural

West Virginia has the highest overdose death rate in the country, but only received $5.8 million out of the $500 million allocated for this year, while California received $44.7 million with one of the lowest death rates #OpioidEpidemic
Lawmakers intended that money be distributed using a per-capita formula to account for the needs of smaller states impacted more heavily by the crisis #opioidcrisis #opioidepidemic #saverural
Currently, funding is being allocated to the states based on the mortality rate and the size of each state #opioidcrisis #opioidepidemic #saverural

Read our full blog post on what's happening in DC to improve health care options for rural veterans here: https://t.co/cqa9NEHZja #VeteransDay #RuralHealth
Many veterans living in rural areas fail to get the help they need and are entitled to because of barriers to healthcare, and the largest primary barrier is often the geographic distance to the nearest VA facility #VeteransDay #RuralHealth https://t.co/8ReFHN1uWd
3.2 million rural veterans are enrolled in the VA health care system, comprising 35% of total enrollees, but VA health facilities in rural America are scarce #VeteransDay #RuralHealth
Because of their service to our country, veterans often face health challenges and complications that their rural neighbors don’t have to consider #VeteransDay #RuralHealth
Approximately 2.8 million Veteran Affairs (VA) health care patients are affected by a service-related injury, and 1,027,000 of those patients live in rural areas #VeteransDay #RuralHealth
Veterans living in rural areas are more likely to be older, sicker, and poorer than their urban and suburban counterparts #VeteransDay #RuralHealth https://t.co/MsHy7Ssvca
The poverty rate for all rural veterans is 6.9 percent, and this rate increases to 8.6 percent for veterans in the most rural counties #VeteransDay #RuralHealth
More than 1/4 of the country's veterans live in rural communities and a disproportionate number of those serving in the military hail from rural communities #VeteransDay #RuralHealth
