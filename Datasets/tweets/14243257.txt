@DemandIntegrity So if the Senate bill is black and white No Abortion funding, Why didn't the Senate adopt the Stupak language?
@DemandIntegrity Why didn't the Senate just adopt the Stupak language instead of resorting Cornhusker kickback? Not enough votes.
@DemandIntegrity  http://shar.es/mfeQL $730K awarded to Stupak's district on Friday by FAA looks questionable. Washington Culture is Rotten
@DemandIntegrity With Wasserman on TV this AM saying Exec. order is useless, Obama negotiates 1 to get deal. Makes him,Stupak7 look crooked
@DemandIntegrity So why would Obama issue an Executive Order for something he said was not in the bill? Makes him look deceitful + forceful
@jazgar Health-Care Insurance company stock index went up 3% on Friday. Investors don't think they will suffer w/50% going on Medicaid.
