@RobertMLee @NorseCorp for context: DIA uses classified data sources for analysis, but today we're at an unclassified conference&amp;need to visualize attacks to crowd
heard at #DoDIIS17: On average an analyst can read 200 words/minute, or one technical doc/assessment in 8 minutes
There's a myth that AI means we'll need fewer analysts. Not true - AI means analysts can focus on the most critical analysis #DoDIIS17

Technology can enhance the ways/ means of war by improving our ability to wage it but we shouldn't attempt to eliminate man from the process
"We must use artificial intelligence like white blood cells: seeking and consuming the adversarial agent" #DoDIIS17
Once we've isolated malware, I want to re-engineer it &amp; prep to use it against the same adversary who sought to use against us #DoDIIS17

Lt. Gen. Stewart at today's SASC hearing #defense #intelligence https://t.co/udv0Ip1Je0
Russia builds nuclear capability with the intent of using it at the high end of conflict. Escalate to terminate (or escalate to deescalate)
SASC Q&amp;A: Russia will continue to meddle. They'll continue to bet on all horses ... including the Taliban ... to get a seat at the table.

3/ and intel integration, as well as overall force generation and sustainment.
2/ Despite some improvements to C2 &amp; integration of air capabilities, the ANDSF remains beset by persistent shortfalls in combined arms
Afg &amp; Taliban: 1/ Coalition train, adv. &amp; asst efforts are critical to improving ANDSF ability to forestall Tal. advances past rural areas

3/ Anticipate China adds to robust defense spending growth for foreseeable future; 7% increase in the annual mil budget to $148 billion
2/ Expanding unprecedented military modernization program involving weapons systems, doctrine, tactics, training, space and cyber operations
1/ China now stands firmly in the category as a near peer U.S. competitor
4/ conducting its first deployment outside its immediate region since the fall of the Soviet Union
