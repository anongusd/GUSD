@CarolineFlintMP Why are you voting against 75% of Labour members? Yes, including the North.	It's one thing if you actually believe in Brexit, but to vote against both your conscience and the vast majority of both Labour members and voters is nonsensical

@JonCruddas_1 That is the policy Jon, I suggest you go back and read it. You know as well as I do where the vast majority of members are on this.
@JohnMannMP Leave vote in Bassetlaw: 67%	Labour vote 2017: 52%	Tory vote 2017: 43%.	Even in your constit. majority of Lab voters probably voted Remain, even if Leave it was nothing like a "very large majority".U should target people who actually might vote Labour instead of chasing UKIP vote

@quantumgrizzly @ciaranosull87 @Uvote4yourself @Channel4News So let me get this straight, the EU negotiated the FTA with Japan, starting in 2011, to punish the UK for leaving the EU 5 years before the referendum was even held? Nationalism and grievance rots the brain
@Paul_Wingfield They can no longer sell into the single market tariff-free because of Brexit. So yes it is down to Brexit. See also Airbus, Jaguar, Ford. Nationalism rots the brain and ruins the country

@Britestoan @novaramedia @tompeck Well the conference opinion is that a second referendum is on the table. If the leadership takes it off the table, like Lavery tried to do yesterday, then surely we need another conference to confirm this change in policy?
@Redpeter99 My grandfathers actually fought in the war and my uncle was in the Normandy landing. And I never heard an anti-German word pass their lips. They hated the Nazis for sure, but had nothing but sympathy for the German soldier.
@Britestoan @novaramedia @tompeck So let's call a special conference and test that hypothesis. I'd go along with the majority opinion, would you?
RT @jwgop: The beautiful thread... https://t.co/ZUkFqgtAng
@novaramedia @tompeck We can start by deselecting all Labour MPs who enable Brexit against the wishes of 80% of the membership and 70% of Labour voters
