@LegacyZeroYT @KamalaHarris Wow, amazing. Nobody said it had to be a policy position. And if you would have watched the video you might have realized she spoke on the issues of Medicare for all, equal rights, tax reform, and criminal Justice reform.

I mean did we expect anything less? The Republican party has been hijacked and its leaders are too weak to speak out for what is right.  https://t.co/Ez5veI6aSw
