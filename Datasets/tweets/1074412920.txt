The House just passed S. 47, the Natural Resources Management Act. It now goes to the President for his signature. When it becomes law, it'll be the most comprehensive public lands bill to pass Congress in over a decade. https://t.co/UNyMk0BBGl https://t.co/HXB8ubyGad

Earlier today, the Senate passed a critical public lands bill that includes three pieces of my legislation. When it becomes law, this will be the most comprehensive public lands legislation to pass Congress in over a decade. https://t.co/wXLaLb6I3r

@CBluy Cheryl, I agree; Steve Knight is a good man and a great friend of mine. My statement was referring to Steve King, a Congressman from Iowa with a long history of racist statements and behavior, not Steve Knight.
Whether deriding racial minorities at home or cavorting with Nazis and white supremacists abroad, Rep. Steve King brings dishonor to himself, the party of Abraham Lincoln, and his nation. We must reconsider whether Mr. King has the moral authority to continue serving in Congress. https://t.co/pUNn6XOpbE
America has lost a true statesman. President Bush spent his entire life in service to our nation. He was a naval aviator, a Congressman, Ambassador, CIA Chief, Vice President, and President. We will never forget his steadfast leadership and unwavering commitment to our nation.
