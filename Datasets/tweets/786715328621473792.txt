@realDonaldTrFan Good for Melania, sounds like she is right on I can't imagine how disgusting it is for her to have you humping her! Really the thought makes me want to run screaming thru the streets. It makes me nauseous. It makes my skin crawl. My stomach is turned from this idea! Disgusting!!
@realDonaldTrFan Oh that poor RACIST bitch. People are using it against her. This is really sad...NOT! Racism is violent and hateful and despicable and horrific and wrong. She should be lynched along with you.
@realDonaldTrFan You can't be this stupid. What idiot is tweeting for You? The great Martian landing of 1913? What are you smoking? It seems to me you are the greatest danger for World War that has ever been on the planet so sit on your tiny hands and shut up!
@realDonaldTrFan Lys is spelled: "lies"stupid. As for your lies goes they make you a felon, stupid. Mueller had you write your answers so he could catch you in lies &amp; it seems his strategy worked. Dummy. You are too stupid to make up facts. You don't know the difference between reality &amp; fantasy.
@realDonaldTrFan Our air quality and water quality is horrible. What are you talking about? Bottled water is man made, filtered and one of the main reasons we have so much garbage in the ocean and killing the sea creatures. Climate change is about invisible carbon monoxide. A poisonous gas to!
@realDonaldTrFan I just showed this go my husband. He said "Too much information	 No he didn't write that. Nobody can be that syupid." But you are aren't You? Yes stupid and coniving and nefarious and lycivious and filthy and s child molester. Him is that all the high points? Let me know here.
@realDonaldTrFan You confound the mind. You just proved you are a cheating predator. Argentina women understand your lyciviousness just perfectly. That's why she told you "Never" She understood you just fine!We all do. We know you are a profoundly abusive disgusting filthy predator. Go to hell!
@realDonaldTrFan Wow are you stupid. You just admitted obstruction of justice. And yeah, wowie wow wow I am so glad to hear this is bad for you and you are screwed. Just like you wanted to do to that Swedish girl in Argentina. My suggestion is to take your entire family to Russia and stay there!
@realDonaldTrFan To get sleep, resign the presidency, then either go to Russia for sanctuary, or go home &amp; wait to be arrested, accept it, &amp; relax.
@realDonaldTrFan Oh my do you see the writing on the wall? Seems to me you have been caught with your tiny hands in the Russia cookie jar &amp; the payoff cookie jar &amp; the obstruction cookie jar &amp; the misuse of campaign funds jar &amp; the lying to the public cookie jar &amp; etc. NO WONDER YOU ARE SO FAT!!!
@realDonaldTrFan Too bad. Are you getting cranky? Too damn bad. I hope you rot in your own rancid juices. No one deserves this more. Lie to get a pardon? No you will never get a pardon because you have been lying ever since you were born let alone since you decided to run for president. LIAR LIAR
@realDonaldTrFan Yeah and YOUR TAXES ARE DOING JUST THAT. And your tariffs are doing it too to the POOR FARMERS. You a$$hole. You have caused the stock market to take quite a dive with your lies. You are not a good businessman  but rather an anathema on America. A curse. A horrible leader. SICKO
@realDonaldTrFan No it's your word against COHEN, MANAFORT, FLYNN &amp;Etc. You are found out you poor sick excuse for a human being. LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR YOU ARE A CRIMINAL AND WILL BE CONVICTED FOR YOUR TREASON!!!
@realDonaldTrFan Oh and one more thing stupid. Mueller only filed the redacted paper for the public. The judge gets papers without the blacked out words so he gets to be happy about what is coming for you. So funny just you wait and sit on your little hands because it is coming for you you idiot!
@realDonaldTrFan You sound like a spoiled 4 year old. Mueller redactions were done in black rectangles that were copied &amp; pasted on all the words Mueller didn't want the public to know he was speaking about you and your family in those covered words. He was protecting you a$$hole! Get a grip.

Yes and there is so much duplicity it will take years to unwind all the criminal and anti-american things he has done. Trump will go down as the most destructive President who ever lived. He has truly sold his soul to the devil, oh wait he is the devil incarnate. https://t.co/ltOCtby8Iw

@WhiteHouse Yeah Harrah for Pres. OBAMA. He really did a great job which is making you, the monkey in the W.H. look good. I am sure this wasn't his intention, that is to make anything that would reflect good on you.

@ProudResister Yes Dear Ryan, this is called "projection". This is from tried and true psychological terminology. This is the good news about Trump. Every time he attempts to communicate he is actually exposing his own sicknesses and warped personality.  I think we should not show him respect!
RT @madaboutagirl: That was implied! #LiarInChief https://t.co/zWJEaazeP4
@madaboutagirl How bright you are. Very clever. I guess Trump could hire you to help him with his speeches. After all you have demonstrated as much intelligence as Whitaker....don't take this as cricism to you. You are fabulous. Whitaker and Trump suck big time!!!
@ibrake4lemmings @realDonaldTrump Dear David, please accept my sincere apology for being an american with pres trump in office. He has completely ruined our reputation. He can't help himself. He is a totally narcissistic fool, but we will be rid of him sooner then he thinks. Watch him continue to expose himself!

@realelhijo @realDonaldTrump Yes the booming economy is directly attributable to Pres. OBAMA. Not you. What have you done to boost the economy---nothing so stop lying PLEASE! KEEP YOUR BIG FAT LYING MOUTH SHUT!!!
@realDonaldTrump I guess you had your nappy and you were able to locate your pacifier. Poor Pres Trump is so much projecting his fear. What does it matter if Mueller worked for Obama. Just adds to his credibility. Boy are you stupidly reaching!!!
@realDonaldTrump No one ever said that 	Mueller needed to be approved by the Senate. Poor Pres Trump hasn't done well in his civics classes. You need to bone up on the law because you are clearly unaware that obstruction of justice is a very serious charge for you to face. Stop goading the world.
@senatemajldr Why don't you just RETIRE already PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!!!
@TMBJon Absolutely agree with you, but if we lock him up will we still have to guard his safety. Will we actually agree to waste our money this way? After all a dead Trump can tell no more lies! Tee hee.
@realDonaldTrump You are such a liar and obfiscator. Blame the victims again? Oh my perhaps the responsibility rests with you and your ignorant attitudes to global warming, wake up and smell the coffee stupid
@realDonaldTrump Yes but YOU don't care about the environment so what are you spewing now? Just so many more lies out of your pie hole.
@TheGreenDailyy Baby Brand made for well need infants. Smoke before you walk babies. Just for yoy!
@TheGreenDailyy He smiled the infant brand designed for babies of all ages. A newborn can duck on them just like he does with his moldy disgusting lips! Oh my can you imagine what all the women felt when he touched them. Probably like turning inside out and want to run fast away
@kjzzphoenix And how would he recognize it? Oh yeah, by looking in the mirror (which in itself sounds like something that would make him lose his cookies). Poor dear is just throwing another tantrum!!!
@realDonaldTrump Oh my have you mislaid your pacifier again. Poor Little frumpy go such on one of Whitakers toes! It appears as if you already have. You are truly sick!!
@realDonaldTrump No it is you who doesn't care how many lives you destroy with your rhetoric and your stupid tweets etc. It's as if your digestive system is in reverse so you talk out of your butt and what comes out of your mouth is s--t!!! Maybe your mommy didn't toilet train you well enough.
RT @IndivisibleNet: Here's Trump's "witchhunt"		https://t.co/6OKFwritd8
@realDonaldTrump I am totally surprised that you know how to spell collusion. Impressive as you seem completely unaware of what your personal issues by projecting such dishonest outrageous claims against the right actually expose your inner fears. Poor frumpy did you lose your pacifier again?
@realDonaldTrump Sounds like what you are learning from looking into the Mueller probe is that YOU NOW know that these charges you put on the Democrats actually apply to you. I think your butt is grass and Mueller has the lawn mower. Better take some beginning army training to save yourself.
@realDonaldTrump Sounds like the head witch cast a stupid spell on you. You couldn't be more out of touch with your constuents and the rest of the country who all want you to lose in 2020. Amen to that!
Calling and neg rhetoric he routinely spews is just that. Hold your ears and nail his big fat hairy disgusting smelly butt to the floor! I am now ashamed to be an American because of him. Yuk!
Soo pres Trump	has access to the inner workings of the Mueller Investigation	 I guess Whitaker is willing to take a bullet for him. 2 a holes preside over the usa!!! Not on your life. Please take Trump to trial. Please get him out. He is just being obstinate and all the name call
@RobertMeuller @realDonaldTrump Yes but it's not dementia, it's ego which is so warped it is probably incurable! Just look at Trump like a very dangerous Baby Huey who has misplaced his pacifier!
@realDonaldTrump Interesting. Too bad you would fail in these courses. It is ALL about you after all and clearly you don't care what you do. Everyone who criticizes you is no good but clearly this is a projection of how you feel about you!
@realDonaldTrump Of course you would say this. It is just another demonstration of your level of dishonesty. Everything is about you right?
@SenSchumer @CoryBooker Absolutely. Totally agree. Why would a mother place her child into the hands of a child sexual predator? She wouldn't but Trump has just done exactly that with this appointment.
@SenSchumer Of course because your buddy is a crook Too? No well like attracts like and Trump clearly wants this guy in sooo like attracts like. 1 crook to another.
@realDonaldTrump Aww what's the matter poor little TRUMP? Did you lose your pacifier again? This is the only reason all this stupidity can leak out of your disgusting pie hole. Oh no I am not being respectful. Well maybe if you started being respectful of the office you hold you may acquire some.
@cmc4diversity @SenSchumer @rieth_damon Because a criminal is in the white house. Take your head out of the sand SWEETHEART. TRUMP is like a crime boss. Of course he would attract criminals. Like attracts like. See? XXXX
@davkoch2 @SenSchumer Exonerate? Trump is a criminal and NO investigation would ever exonerate him. You are dreaming. Really wake up and smell the coffee. TRUMP is a evil contender. A poor Big Fat Baby Huey doing whatever he can with his abuse of power!
@trumper_tantrum @SenSchumer Yes yes yes. Trump is constantly throwing tantrums. He is like a big fat Baby Huey gone bad! XXX
@Ladyblueclr @SenSchumer MCConnel is a 100% crook! He thinks the people are all P.W.T. like Trump' s base but I believe even they can see how corrupt MCConnel really is. XXX
@Ladyblueclr @SenSchumer Yes yes yes I totally agree with you!
@joe_socket2me @SenSchumer How stupid you sound. Why don't you find your pacifier and put it into your drooling mouth?
@patrick_casale @SenSchumer No I think this is a projection from someone who feels that way. Poor boo you need you pacifier rather then tweeting such stupidity!
@SenSchumer I totally agree with you. I had no idea you were so straight up and caring. Whitaker 's appointment was done with Trumps abuse of power!!!
@CoryBooker Oh my oh my. Republicans are clearly attached to every vote not being counted. I grew up in Fl. And it is my experience that it is being run by idiots!
@CoryBooker Of course they want this. There is power in numbers and 1 more into their group adds power to these thugs who are totally projecting their views
@tlamb775 @AsheSchow Yes you are sooo right on. She probably took off her undies and used them to wipe his nose and then put them back on. How dump men are and how abusive they are. Me thinks she is being abused by the law!!!
@MrBarberJ @AsheSchow Yeah like all abuse survivors are lying. Me thinks you are an abuser and this is a very interesting projection. Sorry for making you look up the word "projection" but clearly you are an idiotic abuser!
@AsheSchow Oh my are you really serious to state a cop couldn't be abusive. More then half of them joined "the FORCE" so they can be forcefully abusive altogether. You are an idiot!
@realDonaldTrump Because Mueller isn't a thug but interesting projection by you. I am almost sad for poor little trumpy needs another bottle. So sorry his mother didn't   	Nurse him. What a yukky idea having Trump suck on any part of anyone but clearly he has lost his pacifier
@jvn Yes I totally agree with you. Too bad baby Huey wasn't a pig rather then a goose. Then we can call piggy Trump baby Huey but I see no reason to not call him this name anyway. It fits him perfectly. He is a stupid, ignorant big fat buffoon and so is trump!
@realDonaldTrump There is no way anyone else can make you look more bad then he already does. He is a huge baby Huey with a razor blade in his hands. You wouldn't give any baby a blade but we have by faux electing this idiot to the WHITE House. What a horrible mistake we made.
@SenBooker Yes yes yes. Hey Corey when are you going to put your hat in the ring to run for president?? I can't think of a better person for the job. You are magnificent!!
Great call. Neil Trump but not me. To he'll with Trump rather.
Yeah NOT -- all the world hates us because of Pres. TRUMP and no one envieds us at all. It's just Trumps narcissistic point of view that he is trying to make himself appear loved buy he isn't because he acts like a big fat baby huey!!! He should learn how to learn
Yeah the jobs are from Obama's administration and have nothing to do with little lying TRUMP!
@POTUS Does this mean that if you ever get out of jail for your lies,  cheating and treason that you too will get put n.a. l in jail again?
