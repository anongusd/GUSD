@RSlideboy @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Yes, a stunning display of narcissistic personality disorder, sociopathy, pathological lying, and Dunning Kruger effect that would not end.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Lmao! I’m not surprised you thought that two hour unhinged ramble was a speech.
@CoryBooker Let find some  than a church to do this? Your god myth is something I should never know about. I need to hear policy and how we achieve that policy.
@realDonaldTrump @GovIvey So you would tell them to offer lesser quality to other states?

@realDonaldTrump Still stuck on Clinton huh? We know you lied, we know your kids lied, we know you all lie daily. The difference this time is he’s telling the truth and has recordings and documents to prove it. You and your kids are so screwed. Between Muller and SDNY I hope you die in prison
@realDonaldTrump Said every single dictator ever
@realDonaldTrump Lmao! What case has fallen apart? Cohen is not about Russian collusion but campaign finance, obstruction, and perjury on his part lying for you as well as others, including you. Your written answers, you lied.
@AlecA82475839 @GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal No your not “helping” me understand anything. We know the ban works on reducing the number of shootings committed with them because we’ve had the ban before.
@AlecA82475839 @GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal Yes they are but you trying to avoid my assertion that assault weapons are now most used firearm in mass shootings is dishonest at best
@AlecA82475839 @GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal Mass shootings, look at those numbers. I was specific, mass shootings. And still acting like 11,000 is a nothing burger, amazing. Anything to get around universal background checks or taking weapons that are only good for warfare off the streets.
@AlecA82475839 @GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal Yes they are. Assault style rifles are now the most commonly used in mass shootings. How many deaths from shootings all together? Not suicides but shootings, how many? We have way more than 300.
@AlecA82475839 @GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal They are used in most mass shootings. Stop trying to minimize that.
@AlecA82475839 @GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal No as tech advanced assault style weapons were created to inflict maximum damage. They are very different and no amount of intellectual dishonesty changes that
@AlecA82475839 @GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal Yes they are and they still don’t do the same damage that guns designed specifically for maximum physical damage do. You can not compare them yet you try to assert they’re the same.
@realDonaldTrump Says Cadet Heel Spurs too afraid to visit troops in combat zones or even go in the rain. Your sad childish behavior only further demonstrates your stupidity, it doesn’t cover it up.
@AlecA82475839 @GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal Not true. Hunting and self defense in the home. The difference of a weapon designed for the battlefield over a side arm law enforcement carries is massive. With a handgun you can even repair organs damaged by a bullet many time. With an AR15 and high velocity rounds the liquify
@GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal I think you lost your other profile pic. https://t.co/QlFRsFnuEQ
@GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal Your words liar https://t.co/m8wrvOx9VR
@GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal Yes you said that, right after you said “no one cares”. Lmao!
@GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal Your lies don’t change the truth. I own guns, I’m not anti gun. I’m just anti stupid bullshit because you personally feel you need a penis extension in the form of firearms. No right is unlimited and regulations are needed.
@GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal What was used in Newtown? Parkland? How many mass shootings here?
@GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal Where did I say law? I said what it was designed for and that’s it. Maximum damage to a human body is why it was designed.
@GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal No typically dishonest conservative to say sh!t then try to deny they said it or meant it.
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal Lmao! Conspiracy is all you’ve got? That doesn’t change the factual admission by Al Qaeda or the men who flew the planes into the buildings being caught in video. Your any Semitic beliefs are now showing
@GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal “No one cares” your words.
@GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal Yes cars were created to transport people guns like AR 15s were designed to kill humans, nothing else
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal Lmao! Name one person who targeted a place due to being “gun free”? List how many “good guys with guns” have been killed using their own gun or killed innocent people? You are stuck on full potato level stupid
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal Lmao! So instead of guns now you want to focus on biologicals? That’s quite the deflection
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal “Tagged”? Lmao! Doubtful you have and it’s called “shot”
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal That’s a claim not evidence.
@realDonaldTrump No we absolutely should ask the current POTUS this question. You’re the only person who should be asked. What is wrong with you? How can you be this stupid?!
Oh look, a group of people who think animals and plants spoke disapprove of my marriage. Lmao!  https://t.co/5wrSFFXNwz

@GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal The doctors trying to save lives care, the victims care a great deal.
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal Those are the top twelve. Give a go. Find one developed nation with more gun deaths, not currently at war
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal Those are third world nations, war zones, or embroiled in conflict with cartels.
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal No that is the implications of your chart.
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal Well every intelligence agency says you’re wrong and the people who did it took credit. You’re the one making the claim, prove it? Where is the evidence?
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal That’s not the only ammo they fire. Stop lying
@glenn_wofford @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal 12,000 dead and 24,000 wounded not by suicide last year alone.
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal I have twice, I won’t again. Reread the tweets
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal If your best defense is “the UN says the US is slightly better than war zones” you’ve failed
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal I said compare developed nations and when you do that you’re wrong. https://t.co/xYqh8HOy76
@GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal I know the Remington company well and even own two guns from them and one Beretta.
@GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal Lmao! Explain why having it taken into combat or not is what dictates its original purpose or design?
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal No once again you’re asking for evidence of the law working but refuse to accept the period the law was on the books. More dishonesty.
@GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal I didn’t ask why you purchased it I asked why it was made.
@GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal Lmao! Bullshit. That’s not why that gun was designed.
@GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal Right here I told you what it stands for
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal I did
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal You’re the one who thinks Israel committed the attacks. Call me what you like your opinion is irrelevant as the dunning Kruger effect is off the charts with you. Lmao!
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal Was that gun designed for hunting or to inflict maximum damage to a human body in combat?
@GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal Armalite rifle which was designed for?
@GunAlpha @OdinsEye5 @NRA @NaturalStateGal I know this one, we have objective legal definitions of assault weapons and wether or not that particular gun made it to a battlefield is not a part of it nor should it be. What was the gun designed and made for? Killing humans with maximum damage.
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal One more lie and I’m done playing the game. You’re an idiot who thinks Israel “did” 9/11 and trumo is good. At best you’re a sociopath but more likely a narcissistic psychopath
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal Cite the legislation and its definition or keep on lying and imo,y there is no such thing.
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal Oh look, more dishonesty. Look at the law that banned them and you will see how the law defines or or just stop being a liar  and tell me what the “AR” stands for in AR-15?
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal Let’s do apples to apples? https://t.co/vhwVTXUtNm
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal Lmao! Yes now look at gun ownership and deaths in the developed world?
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal When the assault weapons ban and Brady bill were signed vs when it expired under W? No we don’t have laws here in the states that are more recent. We do have objective facts in places like Australia.
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal https://t.co/bl5OCTnHq6
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal Are you trying to conflate crime rates from population growth with gun laws?
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal Yes let’s ask NYC who used to see thousands of murders a year? I lived there in the 80s. Do you really want those numbers? What about Australia?
@GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal I didn’t save the article but do have a chart from The Home Office https://t.co/pSnnNk2CDG
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal Yes let’s look at gun death rates in places that have banned them or even the increase in mass shooting deaths since the US assault weapons ban expired? Let’s compare Australia before and after?
@OdinsEye5 @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal We are talking crime so those numbers would be guns “illegally” fired. My wording was bad.
@OdinsEye5 @glenn_wofford @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal Aw you’re stuck on last year the one month that happened. Lmao! Look at national totals?
@glenn_wofford @GunAlpha @NRA @NaturalStateGal Dancing on graves? Not in any way. Would you prefer I compare people killed by guns fired by other people? The stats from the UK is simply the number of guns fired, not people shot or killed. Your attempt to dance on the graves of almost 20,000 killed by another person is sick

@Jasonarm92 @bob16066 @NRA In their refusals to hear cases they says restrictions are not inherently unconstitutional nor a burden as there are many guns on the market.
@Jasonarm92 @bob16066 @NRA No the NRA is a lobby group, nothing more. They were intended as a safety and education group, now it’s all money. They took money from Russia to illegally funnel it to campaigns. There are 324 million more Americans not a part of the NRA and want common sense gun laws.

@Jasonarm92 @bob16066 @NRA Good grief, just saw your Twitter feed. No liberty or constitutional right is unlimited and gun regulations like an assault weapons ban that had already existed and was ruled constitutional does no such thing like turn a “liberty” into a crime.
@Jasonarm92 @bob16066 @NRA More than 90% of the US want stricter gun laws so yeah, it’s a small percentage funded by foreign governments preventing those laws.
@Jasonarm92 @bob16066 @NRA No you are conflating hardworking gun owners with a multi billion dollar lobby group called the NRA. All the guns in law abiding citizens hands can still end up in the hands of those who shouldn’t have them. Especially with no background checks on private sales or transfers
@Jasonarm92 @bob16066 @NRA And the fact that information is in the poll tells me it’s the NRA dishonestly representing the poll as a propaganda piece for their members. Let’s also keep in mind that 5 million is 2% of adults. Why should 2% hold the nation hostage and make it easier for children to die?

@NRA Lmao! So pollsters can not contact people who belong to the NRA? I don’t think you quite get how polls work. They can ask if the person is a member and get numbers based on that. That why the polls would say “% of NRA members polled”. We could also look a 90% of Americans
@TheRickWilson Sanders is racist, period. His continued assertions that income inequality is the only problem and denying that racism is its own very real problem leaves him 100% unqualified. Not to mention his decades long love affair with societ Russia. His campaign staff meeting with them.

@Jennfromwv @VaderLover1971 @kylegriffin1 @shaunking I know it’s not a persons fault how their brain develops the topic was “what did they know or do” meaning not the shooter. I could have phrased it better.
@Jennfromwv @VaderLover1971 @kylegriffin1 @shaunking We should be looking at our mental health system and gun laws, not the people or places that get shot.
@Jennfromwv @VaderLover1971 @kylegriffin1 @shaunking No, their mental,illness is not the fault of anyone outside them. To say someone else or something “put them over the edge” is again, blaming someone other than the shooter.
@Jennfromwv @VaderLover1971 @kylegriffin1 @shaunking As long as we focus on anything else we aren’t solving the problem.
@Jennfromwv @VaderLover1971 @kylegriffin1 @shaunking No that’s the wrong question, it should be about the shooter. How can you not get that? The shooter and the laws that allow them to get guns. Only in cases of self defense or a situation like that is logical to ask what the person who was shot had done.
@Jennfromwv @VaderLover1971 @kylegriffin1 @shaunking Why not ask the same question? “Why was he expelled? He went to that school for years. Not trying to blame the school but why?” Seems ridiculous right?
@Abraxsys @ByChipBrownlee I agree, they are sociopathic and disgusting. I find it repulsive people wish to subjugate, abuse, and even kill others for not being exactly as they are.

@RepDLamborn @POTUS As soon as he stops holding 800,000 American families hostage sure. As soon as you stop lying and asserting you have not held nine compromise votes in congress so far.
@ScottPresler @TheLoveBel0w @AOC That’s not what’s going on idiot. Sanctuary cities allow people to report crimes and get medical without having to answer questions about citizenship status. Law enforcement in those cities love it because it helps them catch violent criminals. You’re just a bigot trying to hide
@ScottPresler @AOC I see you have no clue what a sanctuary city means, why they exist, or how they work. Why do republicans always choose to hate? What about you makes that your driving force?
RT @AOC: Is it getting hot in here, or just the elevating public consciousness around rampant wealth inequality? https://t.co/jEvoGVRbT9
@realDonaldTrump Wrong, you’re a liar and it’s just reality and facts you think you can lie about and everyone is stupid enough to buy it. Your supporters only make up about 1/4 of Americans. Not many people are as stupid as you and yours.
@realDonaldTrump That’s a lie
@realDonaldTrump Have you asked anyone in any of your intelligence agencies? Any branch of military intelligence? Any person other than Putin?
@2f_us @Trichomes83 @TalbertSwan Sorry not for you
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump No it’s our all encompassing hatred of racists that’s the problem Linda. Surely you remember the hate of the bigots growing up as a gay boy wanting to wear mommas dresses in the south?
@WhiteHouse There have been nine of them liars
@WhiteHouse Trump can end the shutdown by compromising with the elected officials Americans chose not by holding Americans hostage and risking lives.
@SenateFloor Do your damn jobs and reopen the government. Mr Speaker please find on single cell in your body that maybe still holds this nation dear and do your damn job you disgusting psychopath.

@Trichomes83 @lincolntiger84 @TalbertSwan Actually yes you are in trying to somehow defend white people from the comments of black folks about racism. You then try to deflect from the racism with some extra gaslighting. You’re a racist little cu@t and that’s the reality. If you don’t like being called racist, don’t be 1
@Trichomes83 @TalbertSwan Wha! I’m a racists twat and no body likes me. You’re an idiot son, no two ways about it.
@2f_us @Trichomes83 @TalbertSwan Yes people of all races commit crimes. Only racists try desperately to find crimes committed by POC to deflect from the racist. You’re a racist piece of trash, not white trash, just plain old trash.
@Trichomes83 @TalbertSwan Get a load of this sh!tstain. He’s fine with caging kids too. It must be so hard to be white in a time when people of color have a voice and demand equal treatment
@Trichomes83 @SenJeffMerkley @gebriel99796662 Well no they should and can apply for asylum it’s perfectly legal.
@Trichomes83 @TalbertSwan I mean really, what would a white man like you do if he couldn’t protect himself from unarmed black children and their scary music or deadly hoodies? Lmao! What a fu@king pansy ass bigot
@Trichomes83 @TalbertSwan Dude, you are a racist. The biggest and first clue is you holding up a criminal who was charged rather than all the innocent men killed and many by cops. White men who are afraid of rap music fear for their lives and open fire, thank goodness for stand your ground laws

@CJP101 @KHOU An hillary did get 3.5 million more votes that trump who won the EC by 77,000 spread across three states. Every poll shows this and that has to do with trump saying he would be responsible for shutting down and proud to.
@KHOU Because he is the one who said “give me what I want or I’ll shit it down”. Still demanding what he wants or he will keep it shutdown is not a compromise.

@rmv22 @Dax_x98 Well actually god are a claim and the Bible god is hardly “Love”. The entire concept of infinite punishment for finite crimes is way outside of the love range. Love me or perish is not love but a threat. Telling people hate (Luke 14:26) isn’t love. Sorry

@DarkNike0815 @politiKutie @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 I don’t think arming the public to fight cops is going to improve the situation and make cops less likely shoot first. That’s just stupid
@DarkNike0815 @politiKutie @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 I would deny everyone that right yes.
@DarkNike0815 @politiKutie @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 I didn’t say I was fine with anything yet, you’re simply moving goal posts and being intellectually dishonest.

@Peaches_Sabrina @BBC_dip @ScottChalleen @NRA @Lady_Red_2 Lmao! Maybe you didn’t get the job because you’re an ass? Really bad at interviews? Not qualified?
@DarkNike0815 @politiKutie @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 Lmao! So now we make the person who dialed 911 responsible for what cops do?
@DarkNike0815 @BBC_dip @politiKutie @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 Republicans are not the same as conservatives. Lmao! That’s a party who’s ideology has shifted. Look up the definition of conservative vs liberal before you spew more stupid.
@DarkNike0815 @politiKutie @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 This also doesn’t change the vast disparity in black deaths bs white from police encounters
@DarkNike0815 @politiKutie @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 Lmao! Yes yes and they all should have been arrested long before that. He was actually a person who had tried to kill cops.
@DarkNike0815 @politiKutie @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 The basic facts of this are correct, you can research it. Reagan signed it as governor 		https://t.co/IF5VhC69gW
@DarkNike0815 @politiKutie @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 Reagan proposed the ban
@DarkNike0815 @politiKutie @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 Because it was in response to the Black Panthers in Ca and nothing else.
@DarkNike0815 @politiKutie @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 More guns in public carried by untrained people is by far the stupidest idea that’s legal in existence today.
@DarkNike0815 @politiKutie @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 I do not support open carry
@DarkNike0815 @politiKutie @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 White men with guns threaten cops and don’t get killed, I do have to
@DarkNike0815 @BBC_dip @politiKutie @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 No liberals did. You need to bone up on your definitions of political philosophies. Lmao! Republican is not synonymous with conservative bud. ROFLMAO!
@DarkNike0815 @BBC_dip @politiKutie @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 No those ARE the implications of consistently voting for the party that runs on those policies.
@DarkNike0815 @politiKutie @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 I do understand the story
@DanielBednar4 @JonNick8 @ElviSymo @realDonaldTrump Yes we did. Do some research and inform yourself. Google “Obama 5% GDP”
@ajfaz05 @Amy_Siskind These boys were calling the black men niggers and the native Americans tomahawks. Oh please with your feigned moral outrage simply because you chose to remain ignorant of the facts.
@ajfaz05 @Amy_Siskind https://t.co/4aWyYoKnjv
@vikings1Usc @cpierson8 @Amy_Siskind Yeah the video of these boys screaming build the wal, tomahawk, and nigger is quite clear.

@LouDobbs @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump No the Special Counsel said they have not received that information they did not say the the information was false. Whataboutism isn’t a defense and there are people who have been convicted and in jail already. This is not going away. POTUS maybe should not lie so much?
@DanielBednar4 @JonNick8 @ElviSymo @realDonaldTrump Yeah I hated that record breaking sustained job growth, breaking monthly creation records, that 5% GDP and not bein gopenly laughed at by world leaders at the UN. That was hell.
@realDonaldTrump Nope, these kids were screaming build the wall, tomahawk, and nigger. You’re a liar, a racist, and a sociopath. These kids were taught by people like you. 		https://t.co/4aWyYoKnjv
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends No that would be you. Congress has voted 9 times to reopen the govt. you and Mitch refuse to vote in that compromise. Your offer is a sham and empty.
@Peaches_Sabrina @BBC_dip @ScottChalleen @NRA @Lady_Red_2 If you think calling you out for supporting bigoted policy is discrimination you’re just confused.
@Peaches_Sabrina @BBC_dip @ScottChalleen @NRA @Lady_Red_2 Yes I’m sure you don’t even understand what discrimination really is. When was the last time you were refused service?

@DarkNike0815 @BBC_dip @politiKutie @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 Conservatives have literally been on the wrong side of every major social issue since before this nation was formed.

@BBC_dip @BrokenScales @ScottChalleen @NRA But please tell me about being gay and conservative, why do you hate yourself?
@BrokenScales @BBC_dip @ScottChalleen @NRA An AR-15 aka penis extensions are not scary. It’s the ammo it can fire does much worse than any handgun
@BrokenScales @BBC_dip @ScottChalleen @NRA No I won’t ignore the question. Assault style weapons have a definition, there are even laws that define them. They are machines that were designed and exist for one thing, maximum damage to a human body. One example would be an AR15.
@Peaches_Sabrina @BBC_dip @ScottChalleen @NRA @Lady_Red_2 Yes yes, gay people aren’t black people. Gay people conservatives still wish for legal rights to discriminate against. Another gem of conservative policy and prof they are always o the wrong side of every issue from the revolution til now.
@BBC_dip @DarkNike0815 @politiKutie @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 Aw look, you don’t understand exceptions to every rule. There are anti marriage equality gay people who are republicans, does that mean republicans support marriage equality as a party or majority? Lmao!
@DarkNike0815 @politiKutie @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 No they are not. Look at how many white men in the Deep South open carry states get stopped in public with a gun vs blacks, how many get shot without a question? Look at reality
@dixstrong @washingtonpost Lee was much worse than a klansman. Lmao!
@dixstrong @washingtonpost Still trying to minimize the fact that his desire t own another person helped end the lives of 600,000 people? Really? Well let’s build monuments to Stalin? Mao? Seriously, we are not talking about your average person.
@TheoWind72 @ScottChalleen @NRA Oh so the implication being laws don’t work so why have them? Do you think illegal immigrants care about immigration laws? Pedophiles about age of consent laws? Why have laws if we follow your logic. Lmao!
@BrokenScales @ScottChalleen @NRA We are talking Ronald Reagan FFS.
@politiKutie @DarkNike0815 @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 Yes yes, I’m sure understanding there are exceptions require a great deal of gymnastics for you. Look at reality and it may help. Uncle Tom was real, this man doesn’t change  majority. Lmao!
@BallsDeepState @ScottChalleen @NRA No the NRA actually in its earliest days was a marksmanship group. It did support blacks against the Klan for a while, in the early days. By the 60s they were advocating against open carry because if groups like the Black Panthers. Every modern support of laws have been racist
@TheoWind72 @ScottChalleen @NRA Yes because the NRA has never backed restrictions on guns when it comes to minorities? Lmao!
@BrokenScales @ScottChalleen @NRA Yes and Dems are historically in favor of restrictions on things like assault style weapons. Conservatives only seem to favor them for minorities m that’s the point
@DarkNike0815 @politiKutie @ScottChalleen @NRA @cleflore23 And? That makes the facts of this less fact somehow?
@FUR_GTR @ScottChalleen @NRA Thank you Blue as I was going to say the same thing. The only restrictions they have historically been on record as “in favor of” seem to always target minorities in some way

@TruckersVote @SenKamalaHarris So you assert no trucking companies used to push truckers on time? No truckers drove all day and night or used drugs to help? That didn’t happen? Lmao! Come on guy, don’t lie

@thechrisraines @warnerthuston @VenSpa There are too many people who have never supported torturing kids to choose from why should I even consider her? Seriously, let’s assume her change is genuine, so what? There are better more ethical candidates.
@thechrisraines @warnerthuston @VenSpa She isn’t. POTUS should be held to the highest standard not lower ones.
@thechrisraines @warnerthuston @VenSpa Her lack of morals and ethics for the first 25 years of her life
@thechrisraines @warnerthuston @VenSpa I grew up in that type of setting. I’m talking snake handling speaking in tongues Hell Fire Mississippi Pentecostals. I never shared those views. I knew it was wrong. I knew because I wouldn’t want to be treated that way. No, you don’t get a pass on that to run for POTUS
@warnerthuston @thechrisraines @VenSpa People who must be taught it is wrong to discriminate and torture do not have many “sincere” changes like this.
@melinacorazon11 @realDonaldTrump Actually it is true, it’s an NPR poll that shows 59%Latinos approve of his handling of the job market. That’s irrelevant.

@lachie_priv @thechrisraines @VenSpa @warnerthuston She did support conversion therapy and this is my point. She has no ethics only taught morality which is no better than a sociopath.
@lachie_priv @thechrisraines @VenSpa @warnerthuston It was not 20 years ago and it was much more than a lack of support, that was Obama. He thought civil unions were a good answer, they also are not. Obama never pushed for legalized discrimination or torture programs like she did. This went  until she wanted to get elected
@bootsybootsyboo @fawfulfan As one of her constituents I have to say a big no on Gillibrand. She is too like Tulsi who will vote in whatever manor she thinks will get her elected. They have no set standard of ethics or amorality. It just depends on who is writing the check or voting.

@thechrisraines @VenSpa @warnerthuston I do have a consistent ethic. If you have ever supported, defended, or work to legalize discrimination or child abuse you are wholly unfit for public office.

@mauro_sondra @washingtonpost You keep saying you’re proud to be white so I ask why.  Why should your race be a source of “pride”? That’s the entire question
@mauro_sondra @washingtonpost I’m sure it must be hell for you to be so oppressed no one cares about your sense of “pride” in being born white. Lmao!
@mauro_sondra @washingtonpost Well yes to have a sign that says white lives matter in response to racially motivated killing of black people and institutionalized mass incarceration of them, it’s vey racist.
@mauro_sondra @washingtonpost So I ask again, what have you had to overcome by being born white to make that a source of pride? What is the actual accomplishment?
@mauro_sondra @washingtonpost Well it’s historically been white people doing the oppressing and the pride is coming through that to the other side. That’s the only context I have ever heard it used
@mauro_sondra @washingtonpost That’s also it’s origins, the idea of “white pride”.
@mauro_sondra @washingtonpost I don’t “need” to know I just think it’s a phrase that gets thrown around with little thought of the implications or origins. I can see from your frustration you can’t explain what it is your proud of. The implication being you’re a superior race.
@chrisdancy The other side effect of my brain is I have what most people would call internal conversations externally so I’m ok with that. People get to see all my crazy all the time.
@mauro_sondra @washingtonpost The implications of this statement are there are races you would be ashamed to have been born into.

@mauro_sondra @washingtonpost I also am very doubtful of your Native American claim. Either way you identify as white and your first response makes that clear.
@mauro_sondra @washingtonpost And what part of that is some sort of “accomplishment” or sense of pride?
@mauro_sondra @washingtonpost What part of being white makes you “proud”? Explain it?
@mauro_sondra @washingtonpost Not “just as much as the next person”. He played a major role in the loss of 620,000 lives. That’s not just a normal thing.
@mauro_sondra @washingtonpost Yes being born to Caucasian parents is quite an accomplishment
@mauro_sondra @washingtonpost Great bit of white nationalists propaganda though, bravo there.
@mauro_sondra @washingtonpost The equivalence would be celebrating Stalin or Mona, Geobbles even.
@mauro_sondra @washingtonpost And neither of those things are the same as a traitor who made war in order to have the legal right to own another human. Your attempts to minimize or rationalize that speak volumes to your lack of morals
@PiccolotheMoor @washingtonpost But instead it’s about a traitor who took up arms against Americans and fought for an assumed right to own another human.  Great person to honor
@mauro_sondra @JohnDoeTWC @washingtonpost Yes and you also have the right to be an idiot, no one questions that.
@mauro_sondra @washingtonpost One man fought for civil rights, one took up arms as a traitor and fought to own another human. Truly the stupidest things said here.
@dixstrong @washingtonpost No the fat that people think traitors who took up arms to defend owning another human should be honored, that’s the problem.

@senatemajldr @March_for_Life @KentuckyRTL Really? So fighting to make sure women have fewer rights than a corpse is “peaceful”?
@AlijahSimon The bottom line is eating animals doesn’t equal sociopathy or lack of empathy as that is something we offer to humans. Kindness is not the same as empathy. Animal rights are not equal to my legal rights. No matter how much you kiss yourself claiming so.
@AlijahSimon How many animals get married? Buy homes? Pay taxes? Get to vote? They can not because they are not conscious beings, just fact.
@AlijahSimon Sorry, fact is animals are not self aware, they are not able to contemplate life and death. They don’t understand the concept of rights. That doesn’t mean abuse animals but it certainly doesn’t mean they should be in the same level as humans when it comes to legal rights.

@AlijahSimon Leave to a vegan to come in and attempt to minimize human suffering. Sorry dude but animals aren’t self aware so legal rights aren’t a thing for them.
@AlijahSimon First empathy for humans is not quite the same thing. Second not being aware you’re doing harm and actively fighting to restrict legal rights and allow abuse with conversion therapy are not even the same world. Sociopaths have difficulty empathizing with people that are different

@NPR I wonder if this judge realizes slave labor was outlawed and forced work for no pay is just that.

@RobertFox3333 @LowellStewart8 @LadyManderville @UROCKlive1 @waltshaub @realDonaldTrump Um no that’s what this whole topic was when you could no longer defend kidnapping and caging kids
@LowellStewart8 @RobertFox3333 @LadyManderville @UROCKlive1 @waltshaub @realDonaldTrump @DavidLaufmanLaw The timeline and trump many times saying he fired comey over Russia then the next day telling the Russian ambassador he is free of the Russia investigation is a perfect example of when they should start a counter intel investigation.
@LowellStewart8 @RobertFox3333 @LadyManderville @UROCKlive1 @waltshaub @realDonaldTrump @DavidLaufmanLaw No it points to them DOJ their job.
@LowellStewart8 @RobertFox3333 @LadyManderville @UROCKlive1 @waltshaub @realDonaldTrump You mean objective reality? Lmao! Even the administration now admits this, courts have ruled on cases about this, and elected officials from both sides have been to see them. Are you calling them all liars?
@LowellStewart8 @RobertFox3333 @LadyManderville @UROCKlive1 @waltshaub @realDonaldTrump That photo doesn’t change objective facts. Even he admits it now but the courts have ruled on these kids, DHS has reported on them, and two have died in custody. You can’t be that stupid so I’m assuming you’re a liar
@RobertFox3333 @LowellStewart8 @LadyManderville @UROCKlive1 @waltshaub @realDonaldTrump Former top DOJ counterintel official @DavidLaufmanLaw on the recent Trump/Russia revelations: “The evidence points to the inference—and it’s a painful thing to acknowledge—that the president is a clear and present danger to the national security of the United States.”
@RobertFox3333 @LowellStewart8 @LadyManderville @UROCKlive1 @waltshaub @realDonaldTrump I’m still waiting for you to prove he didn’t take kids from their parents and put them in cages
@RobertFox3333 @LowellStewart8 @LadyManderville @UROCKlive1 @waltshaub @realDonaldTrump Trumps campaign manager was working as a foreign agent.

@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @GOP How many parents of mass shootings or children in the tent cities have you or Fox News talked to? Really? Smh. Since 90% of those illegal immigrants come through legal ports of entry your propaganda is failing. Also, what about Steve King?
@EdwardTHardy So what, he still has his job and will get millions in lobbying money even without being on a committee. He’s getting paid for not really doing anything now, bravo GOP.
@MrFrankBaraan Watching documentaries does not equal “knowing a lot about” anything. I have two decades in the mental health profession and I can assure not one professional uses those words interchangeably. Trump is in fact a sociopath with narcissistic personality disorder.
@MrFrankBaraan Long and short a psychopath is incapable of feeling human emotion an da sociopath has trouble empathizing or relating to people they don’t identify with.
@MrFrankBaraan Considered synonymous with sociopathy in lay terms is not close to the same thing. Look up the two in the DSM

@RobertFox3333 @ProudResister Yes we already know about 1/4 of the US is racist and will vote for him no matter what he does because you enjoy seeing people you hate suffer. You defend sexual predators, child abusers, and racists. Your opinions are irrelevant. You’re a waste of flesh, a sociopath.
@RobertFox3333 @LowellStewart8 @LadyManderville @UROCKlive1 @waltshaub @realDonaldTrump No denying objective facts make you a liar.

@LowellStewart8 @LadyManderville @RobertFox3333 @UROCKlive1 @waltshaub @realDonaldTrump No Obama did not take kids from their parents, that’s a lie. Unaccompanied children are a different story. Trump has done everything he can to abuse them as a deterrent. They also came through legal ports and a wall won’t change that.

@DanCrenshawTX Fact check, those almost 400,000 crossings were a more than 40 year low, how is that a “crisis”? Fact check, gun deaths at a 40 year how, how is that not a crisis? Also please stop lying, trump is making the false claims you just lied about and said no one is making that argument

@1DestinationWed @jackson00799 @JudgeJeanine @POTUS @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/wiSev4jodu
@JudgeJeanine He also says the border is secure on Tuesday. He also said he would be proud to own his shutdown. Illegal crossings are at a more than 40 year low while gun deaths are at a 40 year high. You have the wrong thing being called a crisis. How much is NRA paying you for that?

@SenJoniErnst @SenJohnBarrasso @EPWGOP Regulations exist for a reason and that reason is safety. If you can not do business safely you should not do business. That’s not a burden just common sense.
@marcorubio What about disaster funds from anywhere?  Let’s prevent that. Illegal borde crossings are at a 40 year low and gun deaths a 40 year high. Let’s not pretend this is about safety and call it what it is, hate. It’s a monument to white nationalist hate. It’s fodder for the base
@realDonaldTrump Illegal border crossing are at a more than 40 year low  gun deaths are at a 40 year high. I can see your true concern is for my safety by your priorities right?

@jamadvrs @KamalaHarris You don’t have time to back up your crazy claims you mean. Lmao!
@Dargon74 The evolution of morality itself prove there is no objective standard of measure for “good” or “bad”, only subjective.
@jamadvrs @KamalaHarris Oh so you have conversations? Lmao!
@Dargon74 A counter example of something else that can not be proven?
@Dargon74 We are back at “universal” and anytime you make blanket assertions about human behavior you’re going to be wrong.
@Dargon74 If it’s only killing “and” eating them that is wrong, why not just killing or eating? By what “universal” objective standard is right and wrong measured?
@Dargon74 We know both have existed throughout history. It isn’t very plausible one society didn’t share both practices at some point.
@Dargon74 Yes and countless ancient societies used to sacrifice people including children, many have been cannibalistic in some way and there is no reason to think the two have never once existed in the same society.
@Dargon74 I can’t assert that no, I said I’m sure. Who is to say if there is no history of eating live children it’s about morality rather than difficulty? It’s hard to eat a living person I would imagine.
@ursusmiratus I guess destroying the Judiciary wasn’t enough, they had to move on to separation of powers also.
@Dargon74 I don’t know what they all believe but I am quite sure in the past there have been. I do have to point out how the goal post keeps moving. We started with universal morals to eating children to now eating live children.
@judymaedoctor7 @SenTedCruz @CBP He’s onadering to the ignorant and you’re buying it. That might be something you want to look at. https://t.co/ALIffHWj8s
@SenTedCruz @CBP he real American tragedy is illegal immigration is at its lowest levels since 1972 and you think it’s an emergency. Gun deaths and mass shootings at the highest numbers ever and its “thoughts and prayers”. Your motives are clear. https://t.co/n9WyvlJUxo
@Dargon74 We know it was much more common historically which is more evidence against an objective morality.
@Dargon74 Let’s not call nature “broken”. 		Yes, the Korowai in New Guinea eat their dead. There are a handful of cannibal tribes still around.
@Dargon74 I think each society has it’s set of morals and laws which are different. Morality is taught to us by parents and that society.
@Dargon74 Tribal societies in the Middle East have very different ideas about torture and execution that we do. Very different moral beliefs about sex with children, bodily autonomy, women’s rights, and so on
@Dargon74 I would argue that many cannibal tribes have existed and that’s not universal. Not to mention people like psychopaths with no ability to feel emotion or sociopaths who can’t relate to others. There is nothing humans aren’t capable of when it comes to unspeakable horror
@itsreallyalexb @polgara_toads This is not hypocrisy it’s in fact sociopathic. It’s required of any person who believes in a kind god myth, heaven, and hell. There is no way around it.

@oxfordvic @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump Yes and the law also says congress still has oversight and well, lowest numbers in 40+ years will make a really tough argument in court for an emergency. If it was an emergency why didn’t he take care of this the two years the gop controlled everything?
@oxfordvic @AdamSchiff No they have “asked” him he has threatened which is ridiculous. Congress still has the power of oversight and controls the money. It will fail in court and he will have accomplished nothing it making people suffer.

@TheView I thought he was going to be “proud to take the mantle” of this shutdown. I’m still wondering why we even have the shutdown. Mexico is paying for the wall, the wall is paying for the wall, NAFTA 1.5 is paying for the wall, saving from criminals is paying for the wall, I mean WTH?
@LorenCosby Maybe stop trying to justify kidnapping and locking up thousands of children to be used as a “deterrent” and you won’t be nailed a sociopath? That’s all on you
@LorenCosby This is the sociopathy. These parents know this could happen when they get here yet they still feel their children have a better chance of survival. They aren’t coming due to encouragement from anyone. They are running for their lives. Bigots really hate that fact
@LorenCosby These were children with parents not coyotes. Why deflect to unattended when I’m talking about literally teakettle from their parents? Any compassion for the other cops killed by natural born citizens or do you just use that to deflect from the topic at hand?
@LorenCosby It’s very telling that American evangelicals are so easily desensitized to things like that, very telling of their faith and god myth, very telling of their hate.
@LorenCosby The very fact that you think thousands of children taken from their parents and locked up is “overplayed” that speaks volumes to your lack of basic human decency and emotion. It also is a typical shared trait of conservatives today.
@LorenCosby Lmao! He is because he thought it would rally his base behind him and well, it has. I see comments daily where elected officials including Trump saying “you don’t want your kids taken don’t come”.  He has a Stephen Miller as policy advisor and white nationalist in charge. Lmao!

@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump That would be much more scary than rain
@LorenCosby The AFL CIO is not the NBPC it recognizes them as a Union. They have 35 employees.
@ReformedFL No that’s a claim and my heart has one function, makes the circulatory system work. Your god myth maw zero evidence only claims. Hats the bottom line. No more evidence than Vishnu or even Voldemort.
@LorenCosby It begin an employee union leaves it no credibility with research or statistics when its job is only one part of the immigration issue.
@LorenCosby When led by Judd yes, they have become that. They also are not an agency, it’s a union that proposes extreme anti immigrant policy. It lies about the fact illegal crossings are way down and there is more traffic across the border of people returning than the last the years
@ReformedFL Lmao! Oh no that’s ridiculous. You are going to try and shut down any critical thought by asserting I have to believe first. Personal experience is a claim, not evidence
@LorenCosby And I can cite many that that disagree. The reality the world over shows what works is people and equipment, not just walls.
@LorenCosby That’s a wiki entry by the very right wing white nationalist group I referenced earlier. They are not in any way an official agency nor research group.

@ReformedFL @NBCNews @NBCOUT They are all claims, many of which have been proven false. Maybe start there, the Bible, all of it is the claim not the evidence.
@ReformedFL @NBCNews @NBCOUT No that’s the claim and many of those claims are not possible or plausible. That’s just a lie in the most basic terms.
@ReformedFL @NBCNews @NBCOUT You don’t get to decide who is and who is not a Christian based on wether or not they believe the same way you do.
@ReformedFL @NBCNews @NBCOUT That’s a lie. Lmao!
@ReformedFL @NBCNews @NBCOUT Yes and you should read up on it. One of the original translators of the KJV made notes all over his work and it was recently found. It’s surprising how freely he makes stuff up he doesn’t know and even notes it. It also doesn’t change objective facts that go against the Bible
@LorenCosby @theyonks @Jim_Jordan @SpeakerPelosi No many from CBP say they need people and equipment. The National Border Patrol Council is factually a right wing  anti immigration white nationalist group. That’s just reality.
@DerekCressman Oh it is absolutely both. Narcissistic personality disorder and Dunning Kruger
@ReformedFL @NBCNews @NBCOUT I also not sure how that confirms falsified bible stories either but ok
@ReformedFL @NBCNews @NBCOUT Do you imply Christians have no impact in American society? Maybe you imply you wouldn’t care enough to learn about the beliefs of the people who govern you? I’m not sure why you think it would be a good thing to ignore?
@ReformedFL @NBCNews @NBCOUT No there are many bibles. The kJV has more than 14,800 differences from the Sinai Bible. Why would I not study what billions of people claim to be the “one truth” and source of creation? I’m not a fan of willful ignorance.
@AndrewWVa Evolution is science creation is religion and has no place in public schools.
@AndrewWVa No states are not “free to do as they wish” and SCOTUS has proven that time and again. The founders knew the religion in government is a cancer and you can’t freedom of without freedom from. How am I free if your religious taboos are written into law? You need critical thinking
@ReformedFL @NBCNews @NBCOUT Yes many of them cover to cover and it is fact, the Bible contains literally hundreds of direct contradictions. It is fact it makes many claims proven false like the flood myth or the creation account.
@LorenCosby @theyonks @Jim_Jordan @SpeakerPelosi Hundreds of MS13? That American born gang? Lmao! No most law enforcement and CBP are not calling for it. Right wing radical groups with some official sounding names are. They were the skin heads trump hosted in press room last week.
@ReformedFL @NBCNews @NBCOUT Well since the Bible is contradictory and not backed up by reality, the definition of Christian is belief in Jesus as the messiah, and the No True Scotsman fallacy say there is no such thing as a “real Christian”. 40,000 denominations prove this

@janiesustaita @AOC @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump A god that offers infinite punishment for finite crimes is sociopathic when you consider others get “heaven” which is another joke. It isn’t about legal discrimination, that which makes Christians sociopathic
@janiesustaita @AOC @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump I know that you openly admit to support of a party that advocates discrimination and is the party of racists. You can not relate to the people your support of those candidates harms. You are indeed a bit sociopathic and I’m betting a pretty firm Christian. It’s common with them
@janiesustaita @AOC @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump The problem is you don’t
@DexterGrif2 @brianwins5 @561Pamela And guns also won’t fire when people don’t have access to them and there is not one thing that requires assault style weapons of war to be owned by citizens.

@DexterGrif2 @brianwins5 @561Pamela Sure sure. That’s why the US has such a high rate of gun deaths for a non co bat zone vs countries with strict gun laws. Lmao! You can have your opinion on gun rights and I respect that but you insist on denying objective reality to try and defend your opinion and that I can not
@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela Wrong, you need to chat with a few trauma surgeons
@janiesustaita @AOC @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump I’m sorry you feel there is enough “good” on the side who thinks entire populations deserve fewer rights than they do to outweigh the fact that they think entire populations deserve fewer rights. It’s pure sociopathy that you wish to ignore somehow.
@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela Also no, pencils do not liquify organs and disintegrate bone.
@janiesustaita @AOC @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump Because the gop has literally become a party of treason with trump.
@janiesustaita @AOC @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump Oh no, that “both sides” thing doesn’t play. One side fights for everyone to have the same rights and one against. One side fights for everyone to have healthcare and one fights to protect profits.
@janiesustaita @AOC @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump The GOP has not been fiscally conservative for more than four decades and all Republican administrations in the last 40 years have done worse than Dems save Carter.
@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela And you could kill that many kids in that amount of time with no one stopping you if you had a pencil? Now you’re just lying
@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela I don’t think assuming anyone is better off dead or their families are better that way is anything but sociopathic too. You need some basic empathy
@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela Wonder not wander, I know I am pedantic.
@janiesustaita @AOC @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump You’re the one who said you were a conservative. All I’m saying is if I identified with the same side as all the neo Nazis, fascist groups, and white nationalists I might reconsider my positions.
@janiesustaita @AOC @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump No you just vote for the people and party that does

@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela Nope
@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela That’s great but your somments are sociopathic, period. There is no way around it. That discomfort you feel at thinking that is the cognitive dissonance part a I referred to earlier
@janiesustaita @AOC @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump The majority of the Conservative party consistently proposes and supports legislation that allows discrimination yet you still support their candidates. You’re complicit. Making a call doesn’t change that
@janiesustaita @AOC @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump And not many people agree 100% with what their party does but I d have to think you must be at least ok with it.
@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela No trust me you don’t seem to understand sympathy 		https://t.co/MOnnhEf62r
@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela No that’s the only implication of your comments. Your “fun” and enjoyment matter more than peoples lives.
@janiesustaita @AOC @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump Yes but in EVERY major social issue conservatives have been on the wrong side. Every one of them.
@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela Not all guns no.
@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela No you’re saying you have fun so screw the people getting killed. That’s literally the real world implications of your comments.
@janiesustaita @AOC @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump I didn’t say “conservative” I said 1/3 of the population and yes on the conservative side. Let’s face it, Obama was more conservative than Reagan in many instances. Let’s also remember conservatives have been on the wrong side of every major social issue in the history of the US
@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela Yes well there are hundreds of millions that did not do a lot of things that are now illegal. That doesn’t change the cost of life
@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela It’s like saying “sorry tens of thousands die every year, it’s fun for me”. That’s the definition of a sociopath
@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela And sociopathy
@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela It’s not harsh , it’s a display of cognitive dissonance
@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela I think children have a superseding right to attend school without lockdown drills and fear of being killed. I have the right to go out in public and come home as well.
@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela I’m asking specifically about rifles that fire armor piercing rounds, have high capacity clips, and modified to work like an automatic.
@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela Fun is no reason to allow literal weapons of war in the streets.
@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela This statement implies laws are futile and never work. We know that’s wrong.
@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela And before you make assumptions, I am a gun owner and I grew up with them. My family is from Mississippi and I grew up in Tennessee, they are a part of daily life and a tool there, not an accessory.
@DexterGrif2 @561Pamela I still have to ask why you would feel you have the right to own a weapon created for the sole purpose of killing human beings, to inflict maximum damage in human bodies? Why does a private citizen need a weapon of war?
@janiesustaita @AOC @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump Oh no, both sides won’t come together, it’s way past that. A full 1/3 of the population is willing to see the country burn to pay back liberals for their imagined persecution at the hands of gays and people of color.

@GaryDotson @gatewaypundit It does when it requires me to ignore factual evidence
@GaryDotson @gatewaypundit No evolution is both a theory and science fact. Evolution of fruit flies can be observed but most importantly modern antibiotics are built on the fact that evolution is real.
@GaryDotson @gatewaypundit Again, have you observed your creator at the moment of creation? Micro and macro are the same process just describe different amounts of change over time. Yes we all have observed the results of it.
@GaryDotson @gatewaypundit No the evidence, the actual observations which yes do happen, and yes it is the only answer that explains biodiversity.
@GaryDotson @gatewaypundit Not if, the NAS agrees it is both fact and theory. You seem to think a theory is a hunch or idea and that’s not true. You have no grasp of science at all. You don’t understand fossils either or “transitional”. Lmao!
@GaryDotson @gatewaypundit Actually math has proven it 100% possible, gravitational waves back it up, and there is no better explanation
@GaryDotson @gatewaypundit No I accept evidence that supports scientific theories, you have faith
@GaryDotson @gatewaypundit ROFLMAO! One more time, the evidence is real and won’t go away with your implications that I must first believe to understand which is absurd. I was raised a believer and born a skeptic.
@GaryDotson @gatewaypundit Let’s see if I end up with a bingo. Lmao! https://t.co/Z1fntKe1Uz
@GaryDotson @gatewaypundit Lmao! No it does not. That is a claim minus evidence. “I don’t see any other way” is ignorance. Irreducible complexity is total ignorance. The scientific theory and fact of evolution is real.
@GaryDotson @gatewaypundit Ice cores and geology prove the flood never happened, start there
@GaryDotson @gatewaypundit Kings and places are not supernatural claims. I challenge you to look at all of the evidence that proves many Bible claims false
@GaryDotson @gatewaypundit Lmao! Would you like to hold your god to the same standard of evidence? Eyewitness documentation? We know this through study of the solar system, seeing so,we systems forming in other parts of the galaxy, math, physics, planetary studies, and astrophysics
@GaryDotson @gatewaypundit Irrelevant, evidence proves many Bible claims objectively factually false
@GaryDotson @gatewaypundit Yes I spent hours every Sunday with a very very large family discussing and debating it. I have read it and many others. The Bible is a claim not evidence. There is zero evidence to support any god myth including the Abrahamic god of the Jews, Christians, and Muslims

@GaryDotson @gatewaypundit The fact is the Bible is the claim with no evidence to support a single supernatural claim. There isn’t even one single piece of contemporary evidence of the Christ myth.
@GaryDotson @gatewaypundit Many fields of science and the evidence in them. Take the creation account, we know for a fact the sun came first, period end of story. The flood myth, we have geology and ice core samples that prove that false. Historical records from many countries that counter the Bible
@GaryDotson @gatewaypundit The creation account is backwards, there was never a large population of Hebrews in Egypt, no exodus, there was never a global flood, Jonah, and the list goes on. The Roman emperor at the time never held a census, the center piece of the birth myth.
@GaryDotson @gatewaypundit Lmao! Yeah the Bible says a lot that simply isn’t true. What one “needs” is critical thought with reason and evidence based beliefs. Your god myth or belief in it is not required for anything.

@MrsRabbitResist @Dax_x98 A footnote, I never edit that to “the n word” because it should be seen and understood in all of its vulgarity. I don’t think making it nicer helps at all, it desensitizes.
@MrsRabbitResist @Dax_x98 When the first motherfucker can actually tell me what makes a word “bad” I will accept that. Take the word nigger for example, it was created and has existed solely for the purpose of dehumanizing an entire race, it’s just a bad word. Tell me why motherfucker is inherently bad?
@derrin376 @DogginTrump Lmao! I hardly think words are vulgar. If you assert they are please explain how?

@sequinpants @rubycramer @finnygo If your dad wanted to be more sure he could get tested along with any siblings. You might surprised at what you find is you have any siblings and they do the test.
@sequinpants @rubycramer @finnygo Your dad could be fully in half Shawnee and you show zero DNA for it. We get 50% of our DNA from our father but not 50% of his entire makeup. This is the problem with poor understanding of genetics and these tests with claims of heritage. Even Warren doesn’t understand it.
@rubycramer @maggieNYT I think until Americans including even Warren are better educated about DNA tests we should leave this distraction alone. Her dad could have been full one half Native American and she could have zero Native American DNA. That’s just reality.

@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Racist propaganda
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump The fact is if you’re not racist (very very very unlikely given your defense of trump) you’re perfectly fine with racists and racist policy. Either way you’re pretty much a sh!t human being.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Yes I am an asshole but that is irrelevant to logic
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump No truthful observation based on actual facts vs what you claim to make a point about the bad brown people down there.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Canada doesn’t have the violence yet still, more illegal Canadians than any other group. You’re still attempting to gaslight
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump No a person breaking the law is a person breaking the law. Nation of origin doesn’t make one the devil and one ok. You’re a racist pig, it’s that simple.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Did you catch your own racism here? Is that why you deleted? https://t.co/AYTceDFH3p
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Your racism is still showing. Especially the deleted tweet
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/LDoLrU0v4h
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump The largest single group here illegally are Canadians so again facts prove you wrong.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/V6Hu10Dbf2
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump You’re gaslighting, a favorite tactic of racists and xenophobes
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump There are laws to restrict criminals, that’s absurd. How many cops killed by US citizens?
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Not to mention the coast lines. A few possible flaws in the whole wall idea. Lmao!
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump It’s true. If you were not you would be calling for a wall at the northern borders as well.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump The law doesn’t require that and when the administration refuses to take their application and violates the law, many will choose illegal entry. I think you’re quite the little racist, it’s sad.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Name any nation where that is the case?
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Russia?
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump There are no open sections of border? No breaks?
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Lmao! So China has a border around every inch of it?
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump So what? The fact that something exists doesn’t prove necessity.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump They want to seek asylum and that is legal. The migrant caravans have gotten more popular due to the very violence they are trying to flee. A wall is not needed and the numbers coming are still at their lowest in almost four decades. You can’t change that reality.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Of course a simp,e search for the US Mexico border could show you that. You’re not a very good journalist if you really are one.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump What’s your point?we already have taller better fencing at the southern border https://t.co/Fwm8HfIqwR
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Some do yes but if we just had the people and equipment we could fix that, no wall required
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Nothing about this requires a wasteful wall
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump The landscape itself provides security is my point. Lmao!
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump People and equipment are required, even you just said so. A wall is not when you consider the landscape.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump The US already has much more than this fence at its southern border. Your point is being defeated with these pictures.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump That’s not true at all. The US Canadian border doesn’t need a fence does it? Why would an almost impassable desert or mountains need a wall? Why not people and equipment?
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Oh look, a fence. Let me ask, are their people and surveillance equipment along this fence?
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump No you’re the one implying no wall equals open border and that’s ridiculous. Reality proves it false
@rebeinstein @theGSpledge @mnmanofhour Yes because it costs tax payers more when people don’t have it. The for profit companies are to blame for the “racket”
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump And? How many countries have “open borders”?
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump I asked about the entire Chinese border? If not then you can not assert a wall is required or it’s open borders. It’s just ridiculous.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump The fact is we track numbers via dozens of agencies including healthcare, criminal justice, homeland security, border patrol, ICE, local law enforcement and not for profits.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump I never said complete statistics but we do have a very good idea. Mostly now thanks to sanctuary cities where people can report crime without giving proof of status. It allows us to catch many more here illegally.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump And not having a wall doesn’t equal open borders. Does China have open borders? Is the entire border surrounded by a wall?
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Lmao! We have a way of figuring out how many people from what countries cross illegally and the information isn’t coming from their governments. We have agencies here that monitor our borders and immigration. That’s a better source than a communist regime
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Unless the Chinese government is the government patrolling our borders and operating our agencies they don’t have all the data, neither would a reporter unless they could cite on actual official source of data.
@mgtkn @TabacosCA @RT_com There were no firemen in the building. There was no way to load explosives
@mgtkn @TabacosCA @RT_com It’s a video from a conspiracy group, I don’t need to watch it.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump I know there are people here illegally for decades, that isn’t the discussion
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Cite data this is another claim
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump I wouldn’t trust Chinese numbers on an American numbers issue
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Lmao! What about the US government
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump It is legal to apply for asylum up to one year after entering the country illegally.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump This figure is your claim and nothing more at this point.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Cite a source of actual data?
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Again with the lie of a sudden immigration crisis. The numbers don’t back up your claim. https://t.co/OusB5P6yzb
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Oh I see, you think your personal experience is actual evidence that refutes reality and actual numbers, got it.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump I do claim it to be anything but evidence that backs up my claim most entered through legal points of entry. You have provided nothing but more claims.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Prove it? Show a legitimate source of data that proves most come through illegal points of entry?
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Please don’t think the irony of a person with your name being anti immigration is lost on anyone.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump The largest single group of illegal immigrants currently in the US are those from Canada. Maybe we should build a northern wall first?
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Prove they did not? Cite an actual governmental report like I did from Trumps own DHS.
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Tens of millions of illegal immigrants? Lmao! Just over ten million and 7.8 million are working and were originally here legally yes.

@rosie_rosella @cmartinico1 @shannonrwatts Is not always what’s really going on. What we think we see may not be the case. “Common sense” and personal beliefs have no place in science or medicine
@rosie_rosella @cmartinico1 @shannonrwatts I base mine on researchers across many disciplines including neurobiology, embryology, pediatric neuroscience, and the list goes on. I spent many years working with homeless and at risk youth, that does not mean anything when you get down to actual facts. What we observe..
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump We have a border with legal points of entry, that’s not an open border. Your false equivalence is cute though. It shows the grade school level of reasoning typical in trump supporters
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Who is calling for open borders? Lmao! You’re too ignorant to know exactly how ignorant you are. It’s Dunning Kruger
@mgtkn @TabacosCA @RT_com That was not on 9/11 or during the attacks. Lmao! Now I know you have zero credibility and posses zero critical thinking skills
@JingmeiL @realDonaldTrump Total false equivalence. Lmao! You are seriously asserting the only nations with secure borders have walls? Lmao! That’s a whole lot of ignorance
@rosie_rosella @cmartinico1 @shannonrwatts It does not end at six, not in any way shape or form is what I am saying. This is an old wives tale

@CBSNews For the first time ever?
@mgtkn @TabacosCA @RT_com Let me rephrase, do you have credible peer reviewed evidence?
@mgtkn @TabacosCA @RT_com You provided an outlier that denied the totality of the damage prior to collapse and was funded by a conspiracy group.
@mgtkn @TabacosCA @RT_com No reason except being hit by debris from 110 story building and burning from the basement up for almost 8 hrs, none at all. The majority of engineers who have zero stake in the game agree with the official cause and back it up with evidence and models.
@mgtkn @TabacosCA @RT_com I can tell you’re deeply attached to your conspiracy but you are only providing claims and so far claims funded by conspiracy groups.
@mgtkn @TabacosCA @RT_com And the model I showed demonstrated how exactly what this says happened happened. The entire center column collapsed. That’s evidence for reality not explosives. It’s another claim.
@rosie_rosella @cmartinico1 @shannonrwatts Actually the human brain doesn’t finish developing until the mid 20s. Even after that learned things can be unlearned. What can not be taught is human emotion and these two sound like psychopaths. That’s not teachable.
@mgtkn @TabacosCA @RT_com More claims minus evidence
@mgtkn @TabacosCA @RT_com It was a B-52 and not a jet. The twin towers were built with all the support in a center column to allow maximum floor space and expansive views. There is no comparison. The fire proofing was blown off the steel on impact so it’s irrelevant in the preventing structure damage.

@HappyGoLucky186 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS When Putin and the Taliban are the only people cheering your decision you might want to look at why?
@HappyGoLucky186 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS We are over there so they don’t come here. Us leaving now with the entire region destabilized will make the 2002 state of global terror look like Disney. Their job isn’t done and it’s sending a message to the ones they’re fighting that we are wimps. He has disgraced your family
@realDonaldTrump Because there has been no “victory”. Reasonable people tried to explain back in 2002 these wars would mean decades of nation building or we would leave the entire region in turmoil and a safe place for the Taliban, Al Qaeda, and ISIS. They are already rejoicing.
@Losinmaui @09umt09 @realDonaldTrump How many generations has your family lived here? How do you rationalize supporting people who hate you enough they would gladly see you and your family die?
@Losinmaui @09umt09 @realDonaldTrump Let’s also not forget Carlos Vasquez they would be just as happy to toss you in the other side of that fence regardless of your citizenship status, it’s been happening already. You look Mexican, have a Hispanic name you’re deported.
@Losinmaui @09umt09 @realDonaldTrump Our not “are” and yes, that’s what most conservatives are doing. It has worked the world over to reduce violence and drug crime. Just because you have an opinion doesn’t change reality and facts.
@realDonaldTrump No that’s what you’ve proven. You want a monument to stupidly rather than a secure border.
@realDonaldTrump Lmao! What’s that traitor? You’re a coward? We know
@realDonaldTrump No one is calling asking you that liar. Heads of other nations laugh at you openly in the UN.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump No that’s one indicator, the economy is faltering thanks to his trade wars, unpredictability, and inability to negotiate.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump After being shamed into it. You don’t get props for being a slightly decent person only if you’re shamed into doing so.
@realDonaldTrump That’s simply false
@09umt09 @Losinmaui @realDonaldTrump There will always be drug users. The problem is he war on drugs creating the violence, the cartels, and the black market which makes them rich. Decriminalize and take away their money and our violence and watch how fast it settles down.
@Losinmaui @realDonaldTrump Lmao! Well that’s a boat load of stupid. You must be Ana American citizen to receive federal benefits. Undocumented workers pay around 12 billion annually in income taxes. Over 90% of the drugs come through legal ports of entry. What would your Jesus say to you about strangers?
@realDonaldTrump We do not have open borders. If you cared about the crime and drugs you would ask for people and equipment since over 90% of the drugs and people here illegally crossed through legal birder crossings. The largest single group of people here illegally are from Canada.

@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes And somare boys from their bodies.
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes Yes it is and that’s why one of the major problems with trans people  is black market hormones and no care. They die at unbelievable rates
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes Yes they do. To take testosterone in the levels that would require for a long period of time equals dead
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes Pyes but not testosterone
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes No to use testosterone in higher levels for that length of time is nothing short of deadly.
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes Yes but therapeutic use is not going to have the results of use as a steroid.
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes Yes
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes He wants to be, it’s the bigots who refuse to let him
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes No a FTM should not compete with women. Men who take estrogen and stop testosterone production lose some of that speed and a lot a lot of muscle mass.
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes They will start to feminize again in this case. Higher voice, less muscle more fat, less hair etc.
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes No that’s very dangerous not just for the body but he mind. That’s why steroids are illegal not just in sports but in the law. It damages the kidneys, liver, and brain.
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes Once the ovaries are removed it isn’t such a problem with estrogen
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes Testosterone in the doses given is not going to work like it would in a boy taking it. They also take estrogen suppressors to keep that down which causes them to be smaller boned.
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes It is but they would immediately lower the dose. Regular labs are a constant and that means monthly for a long time.
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes When it comes to biology and medicine common sense has no place. Things that seem contrary are in fact true. Too much oxygen is poison, that goes against common sense and baffles the majority of people. The actual science and evidence is still hidden behind common sense
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes No it doesn’t depend on that. Hormone therapy keeps the hormone levels where they would be in biological boys. Normal testosterone levels are 8 to 60 no/dl. The hormone therapy puts the trans boy within this limits. That makes them the same levels not more than
@cdognight @digital_crates @mattparker412 @WashTimes Yes I’m bigoted against bigotry. I’ll take that. Lmao!
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes Not if he could wrestle with the boys like he wants. You’re arguing against what trans people argue against.
@cdognight @digital_crates @mattparker412 @WashTimes I’m sorry if you think you’re a decent enough person for your opinion to matter, it does not.
@cdognight @digital_crates @mattparker412 @WashTimes And?
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes No they would have the same levels if one is trns
@cdognight @digital_crates @mattparker412 @WashTimes It’s obvious
@cdognight @digital_crates @mattparker412 @WashTimes I’m glad you pat yourself on the back
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes Yes your entire life you are on testosterone or estrogen depending on gender.
@cdognight @digital_crates @mattparker412 @WashTimes Bigot
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes I’m saying if what you assert is true, that testosterone therapy makes trans boys better than stronger or faster than biological boys where are all of here elite trans men? It’s objective reality that disproves what you imagine and you still can’t see it.
@cdognight @digital_crates @mattparker412 @WashTimes No it makes you a bigot but I’m sure it feels like “common sense” from a man who’s never had to fight for the same rights others enjoy.
RT @LouiseDavies26: @realDonaldTrump Its OK, there's a plan https://t.co/SSuJr3eMOp
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes They would both have the same amount in their bodies, the biological boy from his testicles and the trans boy from hormone therapy.
@cdognight @digital_crates @mattparker412 @WashTimes Yes from your place of privilege you still think there are some areas trans people should be treated differently, that’s a bigot
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes I agree it’s a hormone and steroid
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes It’s a hormone that is used as a steroid yes. Boys make it naturally. Why should boys get special treatment from trans boys when they both have the same hormone at the same level? Where are all these millions of super trans men that must be around if what you assert is true
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes Both men and women have estrogen and testosterone. In men they have more testosterone than estrogen and in women vice versa. If you have the same hormone at the same levels how is one getting an advantage?
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes Yes and the dosage is to get them at the level of free testosterone that biological boys have not extra.
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes Hormones which are also steroids are used yes. Testosterone is given to get the female to the level of a biological male not more than. This is life long, not temporary. If we follow your “logic” all trans men should be olympic level athletes. Lmao!
@cdognight @digital_crates @mattparker412 @WashTimes So forget college and dreams of competing? Many of these kids can’t take that time off unless they want to forfeit their entire life’s hopes.
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes No you don’t need more Han men, that’s untrue.
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes Yes and can be used for multiple things in many different ways. Lmao!

@cdognight @digital_crates @mattparker412 @WashTimes Says you? Like I have been pointing out, bigoted sociopath.
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes No one is hormone therapy and another use ad dosage is steroid treatment. The amount in the body makes all the difference. Your ignorance of that is the problem.
@cdognight @digital_crates @mattparker412 @WashTimes Really? And who is this straight white man to tell anyone seeking equality what “kind” of voice they need? I e been fighting for people since the 80s when all of my friends were dropping dead of AIDS. You don’t get rights by appealing to the morals of the oppressors
@cdognight @digital_crates @mattparker412 @WashTimes When you can come up with reasons or excuses to treat people differently then you’re a bigot and in this case a bit sociopathic yes. We all have it so don’t be offended. Lmao!
@the_kelves I think your mistake is using “common sense” when trying to understand biology, physiology, and the endocrine system of boys and girls
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes No it isn’t it is objective medica science. It’s about the level of testosterone in the body. These things matter when you want to claim anabolic effects. You’re simply wrong
@cdognight @digital_crates @mattparker412 @WashTimes There is no “like it or not”, there is no exception. Equal treatment period. Girls getting hormone therapy to transition s not even close to the same as a boy taking testosterone as a steroid.
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes Yes and there is no evidence that hormone therapy works like steroids
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes Testosterone occurs natural,y in both men and women, it triggers puberty. When you add to the natural testosterone of a boy yes it has anabolic effects. When a female takes it in prescribed levels she is not getting as much as the boys would take it. It does not work like that
@the_kelves It’s math and averages based on the life expectancy of humans vs dogs or any other animal. Some species mature faster than others, humans being some of the slowest.
@digital_crates @cdognight @mattparker412 @WashTimes Not when that “hormone” is used in girls to give them boys bodies, it is different. Boys who use it are adding too much Tot heir systems, that’s not the case here. There is also the issue of weight classes to help prevent that.
