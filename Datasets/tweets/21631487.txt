@Gwatson0008 @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle Don't be silly. Democrats can never win again - on a national level - because of their disdain for the white working class.
@realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle In the long-run, government shut downs are useful because they make Democrats more fearful of increased spending. I wouldn't hesitate to shut the government down if they don't give you substantial funding for the wall. You're not asking for much.
@realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle I wouldn't worry about the political fallout of shutting down the government over the wall. After the 1995 shutdown the Republicans added two Senate seats in the 1996 elections and lost only two in the House.

Again, if you are going to promote "humanism" you need to be aware of the consequences of this belief system.

Until atheism shows it can stop killing people, Christians are right to worry about atheists taking control of military or police powers. Simple as that.

Establishing your own morals doesn't do a lot of good if you have decided it is moral to murder to stay in power. One study showed 58% of governments run by atheists produced mass murder.

@WoopsWoah @DanHinz65 @iamAtheistGirl @phipps_billy @MakiN47550299 @macca2514 @WrongGod2NoGod @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES Atheist leaders find it easy to establish death camps and mass murder programs.

Hitler was more inspired by atheist Nietzsche than Christian Luther. You can't use Luther to explain why Nazis initially targeted non-Jews. You also illogically assume the Nazis represented the entire German population. All 100% BS.
@becca07rn @RickOhioImBack Yes. The numbers show Republicans out participating Democrats in terms of early voting. It's a bad sign for Democrats. They were anticipating low levels of Republican voting.

@WoopsWoah @DanHinz65 @iamAtheistGirl @phipps_billy @MakiN47550299 @macca2514 @WrongGod2NoGod @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES No. You're confused. The Nazi's treated Jews as a race. That's why they were protective of Hitler's family history. The Nazi's believed in an atheist inspired "survival of the fittest ideology." This is why they killed non-Jews too. Again, you're views are way off base.
@WoopsWoah @DanHinz65 @iamAtheistGirl @phipps_billy @MakiN47550299 @macca2514 @WrongGod2NoGod @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES That's silly and you know it. Christianity had nothing to do with Hitler's philosophy or party. Again, Jews and Christians have lived together for centuries. Hitler was an an unfortunate anomaly. The reality is atheists are the only people capable of organizing mass murder.
@WoopsWoah @DanHinz65 @iamAtheistGirl @phipps_billy @MakiN47550299 @macca2514 @WrongGod2NoGod @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES You are underestimating the impact of atheism and Darwin on Nazi ideology. I've read a lot on Hitler and I never once saw him even mention Luther. I think you are really stretching the evidence to suggest Nazi's were inspired by Luther as part of a larger anti-Christian attack.
@WoopsWoah @DanHinz65 @iamAtheistGirl @phipps_billy @MakiN47550299 @macca2514 @WrongGod2NoGod @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES That's just illogical. Luther wasn't a Nazi. You could say he was a religious anti-semite, but he wasn't an ethnic anti-semite like the Nazis. Nazis used Luther, but ultimately they were hostile to Christianity. Frankly, if there was no atheism there would have been no Nazism.
@WoopsWoah @DanHinz65 @iamAtheistGirl @phipps_billy @MakiN47550299 @macca2514 @WrongGod2NoGod @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES That's silly. The mass murder of innocents in German initially started with bumping off people who were mentally or physically disabled. This was an expression of atheist, Darwinian philosophy, not antisemitism. Jews have lived peacefully with Christians for generations.
@WoopsWoah @DanHinz65 @iamAtheistGirl @phipps_billy @MakiN47550299 @macca2514 @WrongGod2NoGod @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES The USSR proved the bankruptcy of atheist thought and showed the results of putting atheists in power.

@phipps_billy @macca2514 @WoopsWoah @DanHinz65 @MakiN47550299 @WrongGod2NoGod @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES @iamAtheistGirl Hitler killed in the name of atheism too.

@phipps_billy @macca2514 @WoopsWoah @DanHinz65 @MakiN47550299 @WrongGod2NoGod @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES @iamAtheistGirl Stalin killed in the name of atheism.
@phipps_billy @WoopsWoah @MakiN47550299 @macca2514 @WrongGod2NoGod @DanHinz65 @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES @iamAtheistGirl The facts show atheists are more prone to mass murder than theists. Look at abortion. Atheists are OK with killing and harvesting babies. There is nothing in the Bible that supports abortion. Theists see people as precious. Atheists see them as just another type of animal.
@macca2514 @WoopsWoah @DanHinz65 @phipps_billy @MakiN47550299 @WrongGod2NoGod @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES @iamAtheistGirl You're just being lame. The relevant issue is numbers and severity. Atheists are far more lethal than theists. This is particularly true when you take into account how atheists support abortion. Atheists don't mind killing and harvesting little babies. How sick is that?
@phipps_billy @WoopsWoah @MakiN47550299 @macca2514 @WrongGod2NoGod @DanHinz65 @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES @iamAtheistGirl As for the second part of your question, I think it is unquestionable that atheist books (Nietzsche) have caused far more mass murder than the Bible. See, https://t.co/75MMNWeUPm
@WoopsWoah @MakiN47550299 @macca2514 @WrongGod2NoGod @DanHinz65 @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES @phipps_billy @iamAtheistGirl Not true. Stalin specifically murdered on behalf of atheism. That's why I always bring up his name. Too many atheists don't know their own, morbid, self-destructive history.
@phipps_billy @WoopsWoah @MakiN47550299 @macca2514 @WrongGod2NoGod @DanHinz65 @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES @iamAtheistGirl I'm saying that atheism is more dangerous to other people than theism. Atheists believe there is nothing special or holy about people that might keep atheists from slaughtering them like animals. Atheists don't value others or themselves. Look at the life of Christoper Hitchens.
@WoopsWoah @DanHinz65 @phipps_billy @MakiN47550299 @macca2514 @WrongGod2NoGod @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES @iamAtheistGirl Meanwhile, atheists slaughtered 100s of millions in just the last century alone. I think you are gas-lighting us by ignoring the sheer scale of destruction caused by atheism. You have to ask yourself: Why are my atheist beliefs so conducive to unprecedented mass murder?

@WrongGod2NoGod @DanHinz65 @macca2514 @MakiN47550299 @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES @phipps_billy @iamAtheistGirl You didn't grasp my argument. I'm saying there is a correlation and a causal argument to be made that atheism increases the risk of mass murder. Read R. J. Rummel's book, Democide. https://t.co/uk4Bj7kpsF
@WrongGod2NoGod @DanHinz65 @macca2514 @MakiN47550299 @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES @phipps_billy @iamAtheistGirl Please. I'm a published author with a Ph.D. in political science. You look like you're unemployed. While you are looking for a job, Google atheism and mass murder. Tell me what you find.
@WrongGod2NoGod @DanHinz65 @macca2514 @MakiN47550299 @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES @phipps_billy @iamAtheistGirl FYI: There is a substantial amount of pro-atheist literature...atheist textbooks. For example, Nietzsche's book, The Antichrist (1888) was one of the most influential books on Adolf Hitler. The exact same book inspired Ted Bundy and Mussolini too.
@WrongGod2NoGod @DanHinz65 @macca2514 @MakiN47550299 @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES @phipps_billy @iamAtheistGirl There is a correlation between atheism and mass murder. There are also plausible causal arguments. Religion places restraints on people that reduce the risk of mass murder. Atheism, however, increases the risks of mass murder. Atheism bad.
@WrongGod2NoGod @DanHinz65 @macca2514 @MakiN47550299 @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES @phipps_billy @iamAtheistGirl Now you're just being silly. Read up on the way atheists like you treated Catholics during the French Revolution. Stalin murdered millions in the name of atheism. His atheist followers were the sheep who implemented his horrifying agenda. Atheists get hard-ons for dictators.

@WrongGod2NoGod @DanHinz65 @macca2514 @MakiN47550299 @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES @phipps_billy @iamAtheistGirl Please. You're using the logical fallacy called the strawman argument. I've never said false gods are the equivalent of atheism. You didn't get my argument. I'm saying atheists cannot be trusted with power based on historic experience.
@UKchimp History shows atheists mass murdered over 100 million in the last century. It looks to me like atheists are suckers for totalitarianism. If you make up your own rules, then killing others for the common good becomes a realistic option. Especially if you also profit from it.

@MakiN47550299 @UKchimp @WEKNOWYOURLIES @phipps_billy @iamAtheistGirl I'm a political scientist. I've studied mass murder. If I thought atheists made safe neighbors, then I would say it. As a general matter, however, atheists have established a bad reputation. You can't kill over 100 million people and then ask people to ignore that fact.
@phipps_billy @MPaulkovich @JohnnyIMHO @religulous You're low-life pond scum. Read up on how atheists treated Christians during the French Revolution. I don't see how anyone who has read the history of atheism could ever tolerate letting them have political dominance ever again. Atheists are just too cruel and dangerous to trust.
@MPaulkovich Please. Hitch was an alcoholic asshole. He basically killed himself. Frankly, he did the world a favor by showing the logical, dysfunctional consequences of his bizarre atheist belief system. Meanwhile, his healthy Christian brother is doing just fine.
@MPaulkovich Don't be silly. Studies show atheists are more likely to be single, alcoholic, drug users and into child porn than believers. Maybe it is time to judge belief systems by their results?
@phipps_billy @MPaulkovich @JohnnyIMHO @religulous Please. You're an uninformed pussy who needs to call in reinforcements. If atheism was a good idea, there would be a lot more happy atheists out there.
@MPaulkovich @phipps_billy @JohnnyIMHO @religulous I think it is more fair to say I'm an ex-atheist who is alarmed by atheists who underestimate the danger their beliefs pose to others. Atheists mass murdered over 100 million in the last century. We need to understand why it is so easy for atheists to pull the trigger.

@moyrypass @mattyglesias Please. You're underestimating the violence and extremism of the Democrats and over-estimating the conservatism of the Republican party. My God, a Democrat just tried to murder a ton of U.S. Republican Congressmen. I think we have every reason to fear Democrats.
@SpeakingBee @CJ_Feher @mattyglesias The founders were fearful of those who would use the power of the vote to redistribute the wealth. I'm fearful of that too. They set up a republic and I thank God they did.
@pjb527 @mattyglesias What's wrong with white people? They and their relatives pioneered and built this country. We need more of them and more of their values not less. The last thing we need is a voting system that empowers the followers of Islam and the dysfunctional values of the black community.

@larrybeer @ScottPresler Looks sincere to me. I think that way. It's scary out there when any vile, wacky, politically aggressive woman can lie about a sexual assault and then ruin your life. Even women think that's a bad idea.
@Gwatson0008 @jemelehill @ClistonBrown Don't be silly. Kavanaugh was hammered with three reports of sexual assault just this month and all of them were false. Never overestimate the honesty of a politically motivated woman willing to lie about sexual assault to prevent a historic Republican realignment of the court.
@NormOrnstein Well, Kavanaugh did survive 7 background checks. I suppose someone could have said something earlier....
@TeaPainUSA Dem foolz. We ain't needin no evidence. You is guilty of rape or treason just cus I say so. Dems the rules dude. Evidents keeping the poe man a slave.
@joanwalsh @MaxBoot As a political scientist, I've always been first to point out that tribe beats ideology every time. You can't ask whites to harm other whites and not expect some sort of backlash. That's just the way the system works.
@ProudResister @MikaelaSkyeSays So true. Ford accused him and that made Kavanaugh guilty as hell until proven innocent. If fair procedures harm the women we love, then we need to create unfair procedures. Simple as that. Good grief the GOP is so stupid and illogical.
@owillis @MikaelaSkyeSays Kavenaugh was such a crybaby. A real man accused of sexual assault would have honored all women by immediately resigning...whether he did it or not. We shouldn't have to admire people who fight back against false accusations. That not a bug, that's the system.
@steelsnowflake1 @DesignationSix So true. After years of oppressing women, these white men need to learn that even a vague, unfounded accusation must be believed over their pathetic claims of innocence. The blood is on their hands not ours.
@kenwyatt44 @GOP @TheDemocrats The GOP just doesn't get it, do they? Even if all rape accusers were lying, we should still believe them just to teach men a historical lesson. Right is might.

@orvaloriginal @parrhizzia @sarahkendzior @slpng_giants @gaslitnation @AndreaChalupa That's a distinction without a difference.

@ohhkinny @HuffPost I think the rate is a lot greater than that. The key question is how many women would be willing to falsely accuse a man of sexual assault simply to detail his career, gain revenge or score political points. I think it is naive to forget the presumption of innocence.
@Live2teachLives @Lorie4040 You don't understand the methodology. Otherwise, you'd realize how silly you sound right now.
@NetDenizeNet @AditiJuneja3 @joanwalsh Like I've said. Democrats have lost the white working class for a generation due to this sort of nonsense.
@Live2teachLives @Lorie4040 Kavenaugh was cleared by 7 FBI background checks. You really think the FBI made a mistake about him 7 times?
@dennissweatt That's exactly how I think of government employees.

@westkydem @gnuman1979 Kavanaugh will only make it tougher for Democrats to get things done that most of us don't want done at all. That's how Democracy works.

@Debjohnson12708 @Donald_Jailtime @joanwalsh Don't be silly. No one can control the parameters of an FBI background check...especially the person being investigated. Kavanaugh was clearly, without a doubt, innocent of all charges. Where's you social IQ?

@Donald_Jailtime @joanwalsh @Debjohnson12708 No one is trying to "normalize" sexual assault. The Kavanaugh case turned on the strength of 7 FBI background checks which showed no problems. What's scary here is all the people willing to harm innocent men by automatically acting on every woman's charge of sexual assault.
@AditiJuneja3 @joanwalsh @NetDenizeNet The Democrats have a lot of hostility to white men. It should not surprise you that this would permanently offend the women and mothers who love those men. This is particularly true because attacks on white men, like Kavanaugh, often have no basis in reality.

@paulwaldman1 @NormOrnstein You don't have be frantic. That's exactly what happened. My mom has five sons. She thinks the way Democrats are threatening young men with spurious rape charges is unforgivable. Automatically believing every woman is insane. Democrats should run on that for a generation.
@InspiringU2 @Lorie4040 Unfortunately, I'm less likely to believe women who claim they've been raped. Ford was obviously lying. How many other women are willing to lie about rape just to score points in a political fight?
@delaneytarr @Lorie4040 Also, don't falsely accuse men of sexual assault just to score political points. Not nice.
@Live2teachLives @Lorie4040 I don't think any serious person believes Kavenaugh likes to lie or assault women. The anti-Kavenaugh campaign is over. Isn't it time to let go and move on?

@nes_nathan @CollegeFix So true. If there was no Islam, there would be virtually no terrorism at all. Without Islam there would be little reason to intervene anywhere.
