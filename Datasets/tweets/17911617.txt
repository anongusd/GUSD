Fave takeaway so far: Make giving sexy, make people feel good and involved #DCarts #fundraising
Q: how to increase engagement? A: try unusual partnerships w other orgs, personal stories, listen to supporters. #DCarts
People can surprise you, like big donation by little girl who asked friends. Make sure people have awesome, memorable experience w your org
Looking to crowd funding, eg kickstarter? Be specific on costs, reason, story of project; trust &amp; transparency. #dcarts - @awayoflife0
Capture -&amp; share- stories/photo/vid as they happen, as organization. (We do this as individuals, harder but as necessary for orgs.) #DCarts

"Is he wrong on that?" leading the witness, I object! #VPdebate
Wait, so overseas from where Ryan comes from is Canada? #distraction #VPdebate Also, there are plenty of under-taxed profits out there.
I think Biden is effectively playing the role of Obama's anger interpreter. "holding hostage middle-class tax cuts" #truth #VPdebate

@tonybalogna If I remember rightly about the Georgia suburbs, stop signs were so rare (and sometimes needless), it hardly mattered.
@tonybalogna The two "two-way" stop signs I live near are noted as such, so I would expect to see it noted elsewhere in the District.
@tonybalogna It seems like nearly every stop sign I regularly use in DC is all-way. It should be noted when it's not the norm in an area.
Dear @DDOTDC, Stop signs that are not all-way stops should be clearly indicated as one-way or two-way stop signs for the safety of all

Another turnover! #Georgia ball deep in #Mizzou territory. Maybe. Play under review. Ugh! #GoDawgs
#Georgia fails to answer #Mizzou FG, still 3-0 Missouri. :-(
(we will return to regularly tweeted politics, science, arts, DC, etc. after the conclusion of today's games)
UGHH!!! Interception by #Mizzou. Way to turn it back over, Georgia.
Woo! #Georgia recovered #Mizzou fumble as Mizzou was getting close in GA red zone! Still scoreless, UGA ball. #GoDawgs
@kcesledd @gymerk true, would love to meet more Hill residents!
Sloppy, scoreless first quarter for Missouri/Georgia. MO with ball in GA territory on solid drive heading to 2nd qtr. #SEC #GoDawgs
Poor start for #Mizzou, and excellent field position for #Georgia, who luckily recovered their own fumble. Get it together, guys.
Welcome to the #SEC #Missouri, show me what you've got. #GoDawgs
@JRheaDC I will be happy to oblige! #GoDawgs
LSU's starting QB was once dismissed from Georgia's team for violating rules? Keep it classy, LSU. #SEC #butniceTD
Nats comeback to win 7-6 in the 10th, after long rain delay. Nicely done! #Natitude
Not typically a big sports fan, but I do love when college football &amp; late season baseball overlap. Nats still tied, Braves still in delay.
Boo. Florida wins 20-17 after Aggies lose lead in second half. #SEC
And they're finally playing ball again at Nats Park, tied and heading to the 10th, in front of a few dozen diehard fans.

@dance_DC @JStreetJr yeah, I understand. Looks like community is using both already, from a quick search. I'll add #dmvdance to my roster!
@dance_DC I still think motor vehicles when I see DMV. I like inclusiveness, but most locals think "&amp; MD/VA" when they see DC, right?
@dance_DC will do. Except I hate calling DC area DMV. Couldn't we use #dcdance, to include greater dc? Fits with dcarts, dctheatre hashtags.

@ccorrie1 @heathernaut88 I enjoyed the CNN outtakes on the live stream as well. June, July, what's the difference? ;-)
The #Enterprise is scheduled to be at JFK until June 6th, when it will be loaded on a barge to sail up the Hudson to the Intrepid.
Thank you @cnn http://t.co/AGbgpAxa for continuing to stream coverage of #Enterprise #IntrepidShuttle welcome ceremony! #scienceisawesome

@VTjawo Having local knowledge of the airport facilities came in handy! Glad you got to see another "launch." I'm enjoying following online.
@VTjawo Great photos/view! Where at the airport were you to see it that close?
@12minds pretty much. And they grabbed some nuts and bolts from the hardware store to fasten them down.

Fun fact: about 500 lbs of weights frm Sports Authority were in the nose of #Enterprise as ballast for weight balance for this flight #ov101
Getting unexpectedly emotional watching tv/Internet coverage of #Enterprise. Another farewell in the long goodbye to shuttle program. #ov101
And she's down. #Enterprise has landed at JFK. NY, take good care of her! Love, Washington #ov101
Would have been sweet if they could've done one more approach and landing "test" &amp; let #Enterprise "glide" in to land on her own #ov101
#Enterprise never flew into space, but served as ambassador, showcasing US space program around the world, seen by the most people #ov101
Aww, Leonard Nemoy is there to welcome #Enterprise #OV101 to NY! #livelongandprosper
