@RepLaMalfa Wrong! The GOP controls the Senate, the Congress, and the white house!  If you prepared and did the math, you would have known you needed some Dem votes. You Republican leaders failed to make a deal worth voting on. #GOPshutdown
@HonkyTalk @HanksKendyl This is just disgusting!
@HanksKendyl This is disgusting! Some people really need to wake up and recognize humanity as human!  What a poor excuse for a man.
@RepDLamborn This is dumb! Republicans have completely lost their ability to lead!  I thought this would never happen under a GOP controlled Senate, Congress and white house.  So disappointed! #GOPshutdown
@adijnas @NavKaz Thank you for standing up for what is right!
@SenSanders So pathetic!  The GOP needs to make a deal! This should have never happened of they did the math and tallied the votes!
@SenSanders I agree 100%!
@SpeakerRyan Wrong! Stop the lying and BS.  This shutdown is due to lack of leadership in the Republicans including you @SpeakerRyan! Get it together and fix this! Make a deal! #GOPshutdown
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I give you an F.  You have failed miserably and not accomplished what you promised!  Get a deal put together and get our government open again! #TrumpShutdown
@PattyMurray I agree! The Republican leadership knew they needed at least some of the Dems on board, yet they did nothing to make the deal happen. Procrastinating till this happened and then passed the blame. #RepublicanShutDown
@xbbloader81 @SpeakerRyan So this is going just be a pissing match on history?  You are supporting @SpeakerRyan spending his time bringing up history instead of focusing in governing. He needs to do his job! What he was elected to do! Make the deal happen!
@PatB1232 @SpeakerRyan Yes!  Thank you Pat! 100% agree!
@jakesdcjournal @SpeakerRyan Yes!  Do something @SpeakerRyan
@xbbloader81 @SpeakerRyan First off, Chuck is not my buddy! Second this should not have happened when Republicans control the Senate, Congress, and the white house! I am disappointed GOP could not make a deal happen!
@scillahammons @RepJasonSmith I agree 100%.  The Republican leadership can fix this by making a deal! It only takes 9 Dem votes. Make a deal happen and fix this GOP! #GOPshutdown
@SpeakerRyan Why are you spending time pulling quotes from history.  That is useless in getting our government running again! Pick up the phone and reach across the aisle and make a deal! #GOPshutdown
@apkeaton48 @SteveScalise Yes!  It is like they wanted this.  They have been thinking they can do this without reaching across he aisle and making a deal! #GOPshutdown
@jwhoopes2 @SteveScalise I agree!  Republicans own this shutdown and need to fix this!  #GOPshutdown
@DanaEness @SteveScalise Yes! Exactly! They failed us in their leadership!
@RepJimRenacci Instead of worrying about how to spend the money you are getting, try spending some time working with your colleagues (Dems) to re-open the gov! #GOPshutdown
@SenJohnThune Wrong! Republican leadership control the Senate, Congress, and the white house! The GOP is to blame! Make the deal happen! Do your job! Reach across the aisle and make a deal! #GOPshutdown
@GOP I am going to be saying no to Republicans! Republican controlled Congress, Republican controlled Senate, Republican white house!  You are to blame! Get it together and fix this! #GOPshutdown
@RepDonBacon I don't know about anyone else here in NE, but my taxes have definitely NOT gone down any yet. Actually my paycheck has had a few more dollars held in taxes this year. Maybe the rich see more of a break?
@amyklobuchar Thank you for reaching across the aisle and trying to work with republicans. This attitude is what is needed to get our government open again. #GOPshutdown
@HouseGOP @SenateDems You did not do your job! Your job is to keep our gov running.. make deals and decisions on behalf of your states to keep the gov running..  is our gov running? No! #failed #GOPshutdown
@VP It is the job of Congress and the Senate to make a deal and keep our government open. Make the deal! Make it happen! Get our gov open again! #TrumpShutdown
@RepDonBacon Instead of focusing on yourself and what to do with the money you get, why not focus on getting your colleagues (Dems) to work with you. Reach across the aisle and make a deal. Fix this. #GOPshutdown
@SpeakerRyan @FaceTheNation Face yourself in the mirror and recognize that you did not prepare for this.  You did not reach across the aisle and secure 9 votes.  You did not help your colleagues in the Senate get this passed. You did not do your job! #RepublicanShutDown
@daddybusa13 @GOP @SenateMajLdr Yes. Absolutely! Our Republican leadership know they cannot pass this without some Dem votes.  And if they don't know, then why are they in government? They should have prepared for this, thought about what deal they could make and they should have made it. #RepublicanShutDown
@SenSanders I agree!  There is no excuse from Republican leadership!  They failed to make the deal happen and need to own this shutdown. #RepublicanShutDown #TrumpShutdown
@BusinessNadia @RepDonBacon I am aware!  I say make the deal or deals happen! Republican leadership only needed to get 9 votes across the aisle.  Only 9...  They need to make the deals happen and get our gov open!
@tedlieu Yes they do! Republican leaders please make the deal! #TrumpShutdown
@AndreaThomp84 @RepKevinCramer So I should be censured and prohibited from reaching out to other senators or congressmen?  This same attitude is what got Republican leadership in this mess.  Not reaching out...  Go live in the hole or under the rock you have been. Peace out!
@arapaho_slayer @abc15 @SenJohnMcCain Again. You can say no all you want, but my facts above remain the same. Republican leadership in control failed to make a deal happen.
@AndreaThomp84 @RepKevinCramer Haha. I'm gay and married! But keep them coming!  Maybe one of your responses will actually make the point you want instead of attempting to insult me personally. #Loser
@daddybusa13 @GOP @SenateMajLdr Yes. And Republicans leaders only needed to make deals with 9 people across the aisle...  only 9...  I say make the deals happen! Get our gov running! #TrumpShutdown
@GOP @SenateMajLdr We just witnessed a GOP controlled Congress, GOP controlled Senate, and GOP controlled white House all fail at their jobs! Make the deal happen! #TrumpShutdown
@realDonaldTrump Yes, I am angry at you!  You caused this chaos and failed to make the deal. Failed to get the right people in the room and failed to lead this country. #TrumpShutdown
@arapaho_slayer @abc15 @SenJohnMcCain No matter what you say or try to use as leverage, it doesn't change the FACT that the government is controlled in majority by Republicans and they failed at making this deal! #TrumpShutdown
@arapaho_slayer @abc15 @SenJohnMcCain All aspects of legislation require funding, including DACA. Again, not that I agree with everything Dems want, but Republican leadership needs to make the deal. Get our gov running again!
@JamesJe89819800 @RepByrne If Dems want DACA, then give it to them. It is worth it to keep our government running! Make the deal happen! Get our gov running!
@RepByrne Republicans contol Congress, the Senate, and the white house!  Make a deal and get the gov running! No fault but your own here! #TrumpShutdown
@RepThomasMassie You are an idiot!
@AndreaThomp84 @RepKevinCramer I will. And if you keep going, I will keep telling you that. Haha! What a joke response!
@RepDonBacon Oh please Don...  Republicans control Congress, the Senate, and the white house!  Just make the deal happen!  Your job is to represent us in Nebraska and I don't want the gov shutdown. Reach across the aisle and make the deal happen! #TrumpShutdown
@ZRace76 @RepTomReed Haha.  Nope. I am tweeting all you fine people. I do my research on my own.
@arapaho_slayer @abc15 @SenJohnMcCain The dream act was a bill that Dems presented...  Do I agree with everything Dems want?  No, but that is our government. Deal making for the greater good.  This #TrumpShutdown is disappointing considering how our government is  currently controlled.
@arapaho_slayer @BBBooth44 @abc15 @SenJohnMcCain @TheDemocrats Wow! Way to label me and put me in a group with a ton of baggage and history.  My point is simple and limited to this one shutdown. Republican leaders failed us all. #TrumpShutdown
@RepTimRyan @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump I 100% agree!  #TrumpShutdown .  Republican leadership make the deal happen! #TrumpShutdown
@RepChrisStewart Honestly, Republican leadership should have reached across the aisle sooner and made the deal.  If Dems want DACA, give it to them... Republicans control Congress, the Senate, and the white house. #TrumpShutdown
@SpeakerRyan Hold on. Blaming Democrats...  You lead Congress! Republicans lead the Senate and the white house. Make the deal happen! No fault but your own. #TrumpShutdown
@AndreaThomp84 @RepKevinCramer I don't think I will.  My point is simple and it seems like Republican leadership is making this too complex.  They need to compromise and make the deal. It is the sole purpose of their job!
@ZRace76 @RepTomReed The military is not going unpaid yet...  I say make the deal happen! Pass DACA if that means funding our government. Take the deal! And seams like Democrats strategy is working.  The president looks real bad this morning!
@RepAdamSchiff This should have never happened! Republicans control Congress, the Senate, and the white house! Make the deal! This is your job! Deals! #TrumpShutdown
@ZRace76 @RepTomReed I understand they need 9 more votes, no need to explain!  But they failed at getting those 9 votes.  Republican leadership failed at making the deal! I just want Republican leadership to make the deal! #TrumpShutdown
@BBBooth44 @arapaho_slayer @abc15 @SenJohnMcCain @TheDemocrats That's a cop out!  The job of our country's leaders is to make deals. They didn't make one.  I think Republican leadership should make the immigration deal happen if they cannot bring 9 people on the current CR. #TrumpShutdown
@AndreaThomp84 @RepKevinCramer I pay attention! Republican leadership should have reached across the aisle sooner or done something different knowing they needed 9 votes.  Make the deal happen.  This is their job! Deals! #TrumpShutdown
@arapaho_slayer @abc15 @SenJohnMcCain Oh, I am aware! Republicans need to make the deal happen. All they need is 9 votes. This is their job! Make deals! This is on Republican leadership for not working with the Dems knowing they needed votes. #TrumpShutdown
@realDonaldTrump Why are you so bad at making deals!  This should have never happened under a republican controlled Congress, Senate, and white house!  So disappointed!  #TrumpShutdown
@RepKevinCramer Republicans contol Congress, the Senate, and the white house! There is nobody to blame but Republican leadership! I am so disappointed in you all! Make the deal! #TrumpShutdown
@RepTomReed Republicans contol Congress, the Senate, and the white house!  Stop with the both sides blame and make the deal happen.  This should have never happened! #TrumpShutdown
@SenJohnMcCain Republican controlled government!  Why did this happen at all!  Just make the deal happen!  I am so disappointed in Republican leadership! #TrumpShutdown
@RepStefanik This shutdown should have never happened!  Republicans control Congress, the Senate, and the white house! I am so disgusted! Just make the deal! #TrumpShutdown
@ReutersPolitics Seems like the white house will not support anything.  It is almost as if they want chaos. That is what they are getting here! America is not great again! Make the deal!  #TrumpShutdown
@VP Republicans contol the Senate, you control the Senate! Republicans control Congress and the white house!  Make the deal! #TrumpShutdown
@RepPaulMitchell @RepJackBergman @RepMikeBishop @RepHuizenga @RepMoolenaar @RepWalberg Congress, controlled by Republicans. Senate, controlled by Republicans, white house, controlled by Republicans!  Make the Dallas happen! #TrumpShutdown
@keithellison I am so disgusted with him!  #TrumpShutdown
@timkaine Republicans!  Make the deal happen!  This should have been a happened considering you control the house, the Senate and the white house! Doesn't seem you control anything right now! #TrumpShutdown
@abc15 @SenJohnMcCain The Republicans contol the house, the Senate and the white house!  This should have never happened!  #TrumpShutdown
@KenCalvert Republicans control the house, Senate and white house!  This is totally and completely on the Republican representation! #TrumpShutdown
@RepDonBacon The blame belongs to the Republican controlled Congress, Senate, and white House!  So disgusting in you all!  Make the deal happen! #TrumpShutdown
@RepChrisStewart There is no blame, but to the Republican controlled Congress, Senate, and white house! Make the deal happen! #TrumpShutdown
@realDonaldTrump #TrumpShutdown

@realDonaldTrump Republicans control everything already!  You couldn't get this done, they couldn't get this done. Voting Democrats 2018 due to your lack of action Republicans!  So disappointed!
@realDonaldTrump You caused this!  Should have been making those deals you promised instead of playing golf so much!  You are to blame!  Republican Congress, Republican Senate, Republican white house! You did this!
@realDonaldTrump Some deal maker you ended up being!  So disappointed in your lack of action on this.  Quit playing golf and do some work!  Get our government open again! This is on you!
@realDonaldTrump You suck as our president!
@realDonaldTrump So glad Moore did not win!  So disappointed you endorsed him!!  Shame on you!  Congratulations Doug Jones!
@GDouglasJones Congratulations!!
@GDouglasJones congratulations on your win!!  Go make us proud!!
@SenatorCollins Thank you for standing up for those who need it most!!
@jayMAGA45 @realDonaldTrump 1 of those freedoms is #FreedomOfSpeech #TakeAKnee is a peaceful protest. Protect our #1stAmendment.
@BenSasse Sinking ship.  History has alot to say for those who stand against civil liberties. Especially the #1stAmendment .
@BenSasse You are really putting yourself in a bad place here with your constituents. Back off. You are putting yourself in a losing battle.
@realDonaldTrump #TakeAKnee I stand with the #1stAmendment .
@cnnbrk Can your experts determine if this is an ethics violation?
@BenSasse You are just adding to this mess. I am a constituent and you are not speaking for me now. Stop the criticism and address the issues.
@realDonaldTrump It's called the first amendment. They have the right to peacefully protest. Let them be private citizens. They are not gov officials...
@realDonaldTrump Is this an ethics violation? Is this tweet illegal? Didn't your @PressSec do the same thing recently with a reporter at the podium?
@realDonaldTrump Is this an ethics violation? Is this tweet illegal? Endorsement of the NHL compared to other tweets about the NFL?
@realDonaldTrump Is this an ethics violation? Is this tweet illegal? Using your government position as president to affect a private enterprise negatively?
@realDonaldTrump Is this an ethics violation? Is this tweet illegal? Is this an endorsement of Nascar compared to the NFL?
@realDonaldTrump So disgusted by you. Stop!! Just stop creating division and act presidential for once.  The first amendment applies to the NFL players too!
@RepDonBeyer Thank you for speaking up about this. I appreciate this!!
@realDonaldTrump Stop dividing by stepping on individual citizens rights. Start paying attention to the issues they are protesting, which is about race.
@realDonaldTrump This is about the first amendment. As an elected official should not tell people how to protest unless it causes harm or violence to others.
@BenSasse These are US citizens and they have the right to protest peacefully. How about address the issues they are protesting instead of criticism??
@SenSasse Please vote no to the repeal and replace of ACA. A complete overhaul is not the answer.
@SenatorFischer Please vote no to the repeal and replace of ACA. A complete overhaul is not the answer.
@SenRonJohnson Please do more research into how this will affect people's lives. This is not the right answer to health care.
@SenJohnMcCain Thank you!! Thank you for standing up for those who need it!!  Another complete overhaul is not the answer.
@realDonaldTrump Could you be less presidential?? "Rocket man"??  Are you a child???  #growup and stop stirring the pot.
@glamourizes @realDonaldTrump I haven't seen success until he involved the Democrats.  Please provide his successes.  I am an interested American and see differently.
@Fuctupmind @realDonaldTrump Wow. Trump you really get so bent out of shape over Hillary.  Stop being so childish and start acting like a president.  #growup
@michaelconsolo @theClaudiaInez @Therealbudcook @SenJohnMcCain Wow... Really???  'mine is bigger than yours'...  Get over yourself!!
@SenJohnMcCain Thank you for standing up for what is right!!  You really have amazed me recently!!  Keep it up!!
@PressSec Be more careful with what you say. Ethics come first as  #pressSec . Leave emotions at the door and be responsible.
@realDonaldTrump Why do you insist on tweeting wrong facts.  It is 25%.  Research before you tweet!!  #loser
@realDonaldTrump Get over Hillary and get to your job. Be the president of the USA!!  The country I live I and love??
@realDonaldTrump Another failed deal?  Come on first health care? Then this? Some deal maker...  Disappointed!!
@realDonaldTrump Maybe could have tweeted your condolences 3 days ago.. You tweet everything else. Why not something positive and uplifting to out neighbors?
@realDonaldTrump Closing off our country is not the answer.  Our economy as fragile as it is depends on other countries.  Don't destroy that!!
@realDonaldTrump You should have known how the government worked before you tried to run it!!  Man..  Do your research!!
@realDonaldTrump You could make deals like nobody else? Make deals with the extra 9 people and be what you promised! Really 9 people is not that many!
@realDonaldTrump Nastiness has a bitter taste. Be careful. Karma will bite hard.  Do what is necessary, but don't be nasty!!  I am discouraged each tweet!
@realDonaldTrump Omg..  run our country already!!  Stop getting butt hurt over stuff you have no control over.  Be a president and not a cry baby!!
@realDonaldTrump Really?Choose country over family? Sorry but family always comes first.Very disappointed in you. Re-evaluation of priorities is needed here!
@realDonaldTrump Shut up and get over Hillary already.  Only a loser would keep bringing it up. You won. Do something more constructive with your time.
@UCPD_Cal I am disgusted by a video of your officers taking $ from a vendor.  Corrective action is needed!!
@Moreno This makes me so angry.  This is heartless and not how our police should act!!
@realDonaldTrump You had a choice and you made the wrong one. Very disappointed by your actions in office.
@TheRealMaffoo Good, then understand that they are just as American as you and I.
@PatTiberi Pass the #DreamAct then.  It is written!!  Vote on it today!!
@realDonaldTrump This is yet another sad day in your presidency.  Wrong decision @POTUS!! Congress pass the #DREAMAct!!
@TheRealMaffoo I challenge you to travel to another country and help your fellow humans.  It may enlighten your views on the world!

@SenWhitehouse Thank you for supporting!! #DefendDACA
@SenWhitehouse @realDonaldTrump Thank you for supporting #DACA!!  #Dreamers deserve a chance!!
@Kenricward There is no way that the judge could have known he would do this w/ 1 possession of marijuana charge. Murder is not excusable. weed≠murder
@Kenricward This is a sad story. Thanks for sharing. I still don't think this warrants denying other #Dreamers a chance. I still #DefendDACA!
@BuccaneerD @CNN 'pimps and whores' aren't really changing my support. I am thankful for the aid &amp; can see there is no changing your logic. #agreetodisagree?
@Kenricward I agree that not all who obtained a #Dreamers status under #DACA were good.  But the article proves my point.  They all lost their status.
@Kenricward Maybe review the differences between two different legislative items. #DACA is a way to help manage sanctuary cities and decrease criminals.
@Kenricward I am sure this is a response to my #DACA tweets. Sanctuary cities are different from #DACA.  #Dreamers are not allowed a criminal record.
@SenSasse Our neighbors include #Dreamers.  Stand up and #DefendDACA. They are people too and contribute to our community!!
@BuccaneerD @CNN Interesting analogy...  I am no expert on pimps or whores. I see we need aid &amp; MX is helping to provide that. Seems respec &amp; caring. Thx MX!

@radmadmid @SenFranken @POTUS Changing rules to create an inclusive and diverse USA, allowing individuals to thrive and overcome poverty. I scream #DACA #DACAWorks
@radmadmid @FreeThinkTX @KariGarber @FoxNews @GovAbbott I invite them to stay.  I need their tax dollars they pay to continue to pay for infrastructure, like roads and bridges. I need #Dreamers!
@radmadmid @SenFranken @POTUS None of them have committed a scam against you or anyone else.  They simply ask to keep the life they have had for many years.
@radmadmid @SenFranken @POTUS I am for rules. Society can't function w/out.  The rule I support is #DACA. It contributes to society and doesn't take from it. #DACAWorks
@radmadmid @FreeThinkTX @KariGarber @FoxNews @GovAbbott Great! Glad to hear, as have I and I am glad to allow diversity to thrive in our unique country. We need these individuals to continue here.
@radmadmid @SenFranken @POTUS Neither is kick good people out, build a wall, and isolate this country further. #DACA allows good people to stay and contribute positively.
@radmadmid @SenFranken @POTUS Read the #DACA documents.  If you did, then you would know there are more requirements than that. Again, for imm control with #DACA added!
@radmadmid @FreeThinkTX @KariGarber @FoxNews @GovAbbott Maybe you should consider going to another country and making a positive impact. It might enlighten your thinking a bit.  It did mine...
@radmadmid @SenFranken @POTUS I consider having a job, education, and respect to step forward as #Dreamers better than this who lack empathy and compassion! #DefendDACA
@radmadmid @SenFranken @POTUS I have not heard any #Dreamers asking or petitioning for open borders. They are following the new 'rules' #DACAWorks. The rules need change!
@radmadmid @FreeThinkTX @KariGarber @FoxNews @GovAbbott How are you contributing to your kids dreams other than preventing other kids from accomplishing theirs? Try a positive impact not negative!
@radmadmid @SenFranken @POTUS This situation could get better, by having compassion for fellow human beings who deserve respect for positively impacting our society!!
@radmadmid @SenFranken @POTUS They contribute to society positively by having an education and a job. They do not demand open borders. They demand and deserve respect!!
@radmadmid @SenFranken @POTUS You are wrong.  I can be for Imm control and still support #DACA. Imm control='rules'. I think the 'rules' need to change. #DACA=change. :)
@radmadmid @SenFranken @POTUS Not all 7.5B ppl want in this country.  I am for imm. control including #DACA. Let them stay &amp; encourage them to positively impact the USA.
@radmadmid @SenFranken @POTUS Ppl here, contributing to society positively deserve legal status. We wouldn't kick out uneducated, jobless, &amp; 'legal' ppl.  Would we?
@radmadmid @SenFranken @POTUS They are human beings who deserve respect. They are in this country and contribute to our society. I support them becoming legal citizens.
@radmadmid @SenFranken @POTUS #DACA isn't about who comes into this country.  The people #DACA applies to are already here. They deserve the right to stay. #DefendDACA
@BuccaneerD @CNN I am a proud supporter of the MX aid to the US.  That was the topic of the article.  Not jobs...  Who spun the topic?
@radmadmid @SenFranken @POTUS The 'rules' needed change. #DACA did that. I support of allowing #DACA to stand, allowing immigrants a chance in this country.#DefendDACA
@pastormarkburns Anybody who lives a good life in the borders of this country should be considered an American.  #DefendDACA
@BuccaneerD @CNN My neighbors are wonderful people and only want the best for me. Maybe you should consider moving if your neighbor has it out for you???
@HRC Yes we need to protect #Dreamers!!

@SenFranken @POTUS Thank you for your support of #DACA.  Represent all Americans and those who wish to become American.  #DefendDACA
