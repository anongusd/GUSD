Rep told me @USAirways is still looking into flight attendant's response. Wasn't clear if an apology would be coming. @wsoctv
Talked to @USAirways rep. Said they're trying to reach Sgt. Marle. They want to thank him for his service.
It should be noted: Sgt. Marle asked if his coat could be hung in a closet. Passengers said he didn't fuss. They did in response.
Sgt. Marle's parents told me his uniform is very important to him. He is Special Forces Green Beret. Loves his country. @wsoctv
Here's the original story about Sgt. Marle on board yesterday @USAirways flt. #1930. http://t.co/XcZQJ5rg35
Just spoke w/ Sgt. Marle's parents. Said they talked to him last night. He never mentioned @USAirways ordeal. Said that's how humble he is.
