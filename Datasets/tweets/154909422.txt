-And finally (and most relevant for reporters), all prior payments under the CAA will be reported to the public within 30 days
-Interns and fellows will be protected just like everybody else	-Lawmakers responsible for settlements or awards will have the amount deducted from their wages or their future wages/Social Security if they leave Congress
-Staffers will not have to undergo counseling, mediation and "cooling off" periods to get accountability and/or file a lawsuit	-Staffers will not have to sign NDAs in order to start the process and can ask to  work remotely or go on paid leave while it happens
Stuff that will happen as a result of this bill: 	-Lawmakers who harass or retaliate will have to pay for their own settlements and up to $300K of court-ordered awards	-Settlements and awards will be reported annually to the public

She said Cuellar told her she was under a 90-day probation period when she asked him to meet to discuss her maternity leave. He later told her she had not addressed his concerns about her work, she said.

@Eugene_Scott @DPAQreport “Keep it moving” is so good
@crampell My favorite. Found in an invitation for an anti-Trump flash mob at the White House.
The funniest finds so far are tweets where the Russians went meta and started messaging on their own purported actions and U.S. political involvement -- tweets that were pro-DOJ, pro-Russian indictments, anti-"Internet Research Agency f*ckers."
Here are the news organizations that were mentioned by the Russians, either in private conversations or on social media, according to the indictment. Breitbart and BuzzFeed were allegedly mentioned in a neutral way - the rest, negatively: https://t.co/b6tiK5K6cr
You can imagine that Trump was referred to both positively and negatively.
A few more lists. Here's what the accounts allegedly had to say about figures in U.S. politics who are not Trump and not lawmakers or candidates: https://t.co/mj9NglN4Bf
I want to emphasize that these lists reflect how they allegedly framed these issues, not how I frame these issues.
And here's what the Russian accounts expressed opposition to or stoked concern about, per the indictment: https://t.co/U5w6AeqKbR
Continuing my inventory, here is what the Russian accounts expressed support for, sympathy for or solidarity with, according to the indictment: https://t.co/YEzmiDHkmx
For those following the new Russia indictment, here's a look at how the Russians allegedly messaged or planned to message about the various lawmakers and congressional candidates mentioned in the filing. Underscores their commitment to playing for and against all sides: https://t.co/djY9cs9317

The interview -- playful, off-color, emotional -- revealed someone with complicated feelings about being a #Resistance leader, who feels threatened or overwhelmed at times by her fans, and whose life has changed in some sad and irrevocable ways because of all of this.
"I don't really consider myself to be a super feminist," she said.
To me, the most interesting part was her response to the idea that she's leading a "feminist crusade": https://t.co/oazye4cKDN
The interview was flattering to her. Huys asked over and over if she will enter the history books by bringing down DT. She claimed to have more damaging info but otherwise gave pretty measured answers. Knows there's a chance her cases won't succeed. Doesn't think he will resign.

She talked about hearing the Cohen news for the first time. She was in Italy and said she opened a bottle of wine before this happened: https://t.co/N5IdJ46uem
She said the most frustrating criticisms she receives are (1) accusations she's lying (2) suggestions she's doing this for money (3) charges that she's a bad parent
Here's what she had to say about Giuliani, with an unexpected reference to Melania: https://t.co/NYTqvOoSfF
The most personal parts of the interview had to do with her husband (who filed for divorce in July) and her seven-year-old daughter. She said her marriage couldn't take the stress of her sudden, strange celebrity: https://t.co/cU4clt8yRx
She spoke about her childhood and her career and business sense. She's proud of both and doesn't think she gets enough credit for either.
She said she felt "in danger" before she became a public figure given her situation with Trump: https://t.co/CYIFm0ONZR
About her fear that someone could do "something stupid," either a Trump supporter or a fan: https://t.co/1IjPT2GVvK

She talked about her need for bodyguards -- to deal with people who love her as well as people who hate her: https://t.co/AxCnipZpUu
But there's a lot for Stormy fans or those interested in her life these days.
For those following Stormy's cases, there wasn't a lot of news. She said the NDA suit could be delayed again at the status hearing before Judge Otero on Monday.
The host, Twan Huys, asked why she came on his program and didn't just fly back to the US to appear on CNN. She said it's about avoiding legal risk: https://t.co/iUa9dqEBQD
This interview contains her first at-length reaction to the Michael Cohen news. It is one of her only TV appearances -- if not her only TV appearance -- since she went on "60 Minutes" in March.
Couple of thoughts. Readers often feel like @StormyDaniels is everywhere, but she doesn't speak to the media all that often.

Jordan didn't say much about the interview itself, but he didn't have anything bad to say about Perkins Coie or its lawyers this time. "I thought that the lawyer who did that [the interview] handled it the proper way," he said.
Interesting fodder from the interview: Jordan declined to repeat previous criticisms of Perkins Coie and said the firm had, in fact, reached out to his office about scheduling an interview. "They had called our office," he said. "I just didn't get that message."

Here's our story from today: https://t.co/cKIIn9JaUW
Again, Jordan denies seeing, knowing or hearing about any sexual abuse or inappropriate behavior during his time as an assistant coach at OSU. As many as eight former wrestlers say knew or he must have known; only one of those says he told Jordan directly.
Delman said he doesn’t understand Jordan’s denials since it would have been "extremely difficult" for him not to know. “I think times are different and I think it could have been put in light of the times,” he said. “I don’t know why he would try to sweep it under the rug.”
We've updated this story with another wrestler saying it would be "extremely difficult" for Jordan not to know. “I have no doubt that Russ and Jim knew, but I never heard it presented in a way that made it  need to be addressed in any large sense,” Reid Delman said.
Here's our story, which we expect to build on today: https://t.co/HXyBMaoxUW
The statement comes from:	Russ Hellickson, former head coach	 Dave Ruckman, former assistant coach	 Rex Holman, former assistant coach	 Ken Chertow, former assistant coach	 Myron Kharchilava, former assistant coach	 Kenny Ramsey Jr., former assistant coach
"We all worked on the wrestling coaching staff during Jim’s tenure at The Ohio State University. None of us saw or heard of abuse of OSU  wrestlers. The well-being of student-athletes was all of our concern. If we had heard of any abuse, we would have spoken up.”
Just in: six former wrestling coaches from Ohio State are vouching for Jordan with a unified statement that calls allegations he knew "absolutely wrong."
“I’m devastated by what I’ve heard," said one. "My heart goes out to anyone who was abused in any way. But Jim Jordan is a tremendous human being ... If he had any knowledge of any misconduct, he would deal with it. There’s no question in my mind.’’
The wrestlers said they and other alumni are planning a public show of support for Jordan, maybe an open letter.

“Currently, I spend about 20% of my time in clinical sports medicine with OSU varsity athletes, at the Sports Medicine Clinic of the Student Health Service and at the Larkins Hall training room daily in the late afternoon."
My favorite find was a reference by Strauss to Larkins Hall as early as 1980. He wrote this in a memo that was included in his employment file:
He said he doesn't remember much about Strauss, who resigned as team physician on June 30, 1995. He also said he does not know what Jordan knew, saying they didn't overlap for very long. Jordan left OSU on May 31, 1995, according to the school.
“I was concerned that we not have harassment on either side — that the  wrestlers be left alone and feel secure and not harassed or observed or  approached ... At the same time, I didn’t want [the athletes] to retaliate or make a mistake they would regret," he said.
Geiger said he worked extensively with head wrestling coach Russ Hellickson to move the wrestlers because many were "feeling uncomfortable" with voyeurism in Larkins. He suggested he was concerned about the situation coming to blows.
We learned that Larkins Hall was demolished in 2005, two years after a warehouse was renovated to become Steelwood Athletic Training Facility. That's where the wrestlers, fencers and gymnasts at Ohio State moved, per Andy Geiger, the athletic director starting in April 1994.
We learned Strauss was a big name in sports medicine during his career, and part of an effort to win more recognition for it as a medical specialty. (Not in our story, but The Washington Post quoted him about student steroid use in 1989.)
Ohio State declined to say if it has received allegations about Strauss's time in those places. States where he worked include Massachusetts, Hawaii, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Washington.
We note that Strauss was affiliated with about half a dozen medical schools or hospitals as a professor, resident or fellow before he landed at Ohio State.  Strauss was licensed to practice medicine in seven states by 1975.
The school declined to confirm or deny that a hearing took place or offer more detail.
We note that Ohio State's student newspaper, The Lantern, reported in April that an unnamed OSU athlete was asked to testify at a personnel hearing against Strauss in the spring of 1997. There appear to be no references to a hearing in Strauss's personnel file, which is online.
We learned that Ohio State conducted summer wrestling camps for kids in as early as 1989. The school declined to say whether those camps are covered by the Strauss investigation or to provide more detail, like the ages of the kids involved.
Eisen: “The evidence that Rep. Jordan is lying continues to mount. If this were a ‘he said, he said’ matter that would be one thing. But with seven witnesses  already stepping forward and perhaps more in the wings, an Office of  Congressional Ethics investigation is needed.”
Wertheimer: “If Rep. Jordan is lying, he failed to protect student wrestlers under  his supervision ... This is a very serious matter that goes to the institutional integrity  of the House and its Members.”
(I want to note again that Jordan has repeatedly denied seeing, hearing or knowing about any abuse or misconduct while he was an assistant coach at Ohio State.)
A few new elements: @NormEisen and @FredWertheimer are calling for a preliminary ethics inquiry by the Office of Congressional Ethics in a letter they will send tomorrow.

@ChadPergram Chad, was this to you or on air? Thanks.
New: Jordan's office confirms he successfully made contact with lawyers investigating Strauss's behavior at Ohio State and has scheduled an interview with them. There was a whole back-and-forth on Tuesday about this.
As a reminder, Hellickson has said that he not only knew about the alleged abuse -- he reported it to school administrators and even confronted Strauss.
"At no time while Jim Jordan was a coach with me at Ohio State did either of us ignore abuse of our wrestlers," he stated.
One quote was from Russ Hellickson, who served as the head wrestling coach when Jordan was assistant coach. He described Jordan as "the most honorable man I have ever known," among other accolades, but did not say directly whether he believes Jordan knew about the alleged abuse.
The other development from the last 24 hours was Jordan's office working to rebut the allegations by releasing statements from character witnesses for Jordan and against DiSabato.
Jordan "took showers with us, he saw Dr. Strauss and others perform these kind of acts in front of us. It was a huge issue within the team," DiSabato said.
Here's the full DiSabato quote to CNN after he was asked whether he spoke to Jordan about the alleged abuse. He describes the "lewd acts" as "public masturbation" and "excessive soaping" of the groin area: https://t.co/nWMStCycwo
I want to note again that Jordan denies knowing, seeing or hearing anything.
Michael DiSabato has been interviewed several times at this point. He went into into detail with CNN on Wednesday, saying Jordan saw Strauss and others perform "lewd acts" in the showers: https://t.co/jtKcTA0L4p
His office wouldn't say - maybe they will at some point.
The short version: Jordan questioned the timing of the original NBC report, saying, "Look, the timing makes you wonder. All I know is, it’s not true. ... It’s interesting that the timing is what it is, in light of things that are going on in Washington." What was he referring to?
I also asked the office to clarify what Jordan meant in this interview with reporters in Ohio on Wednesday: https://t.co/fj0UdJ1E2t
I asked Jordan's office about the emails and whether they've contacted the Capitol Police. They wouldn't say.
The source said DiSabato had been sending Jordan emails for a few months and that the number of messages made them vaguely threatening (CNN's phrase). That report is here: https://t.co/bUl4zF9aNT
An unnamed source in Jordan's office told CNN that Jordan will contact the Capitol Police over "bullying" emails received from Michael DiSabato, the main source in NBC's original story, who says he was sexually abused by Strauss.
Controversy over whether @Jim_Jordan knew about sexual misconduct allegations against Richard Strauss has entered its third day, though with Congress in recess, things are still pretty quiet.

"Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State.  He has not been contacted by investigators about the  matter but will assist them ...
As a reminder, here's the statement from Jordan:
DiSabato said Strauss, now deceased, first abused him when he was 14. He said he believes there are 1,000-2,000 victims. “He was Larry Nassar before Larry Nassar,” DiSabato said.
“He knew,” DiSabato said in a brief phone interview with The Post. “That’s not a question. Why he had a spokesman put out misinformation is frankly beyond comprehension, because is he the target of this? No. It was common knowledge and he knew.”
Strong language from Michael DiSabato, who says @Jim_Jordan knew about Richard Strauss's alleged abuse at Ohio State. (Jordan denies he knew, witnessed or heard anything.)

The suit lists the causes of action as sexual battery, common law battery, sexual assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The plaintiff, who was not named in the suit, is being represented by @LisaBloom. Bloom did not respond to a request for comment.

A lawyer for @RepCardenas confirmed he is the "John Doe" named in the lawsuit. That was after The Post learned from Democratic aides that he has been calling colleagues about the whole thing.

It is unclear whether law enforcement is probing Duncan's spending. But it's hard not to think of Jesse Jackson Jr. in these cases: https://t.co/yig6Ki8ipJ
@Rep_Hunter is under criminal investigation for similar allegations: https://t.co/Kmk9zMRFb6
Will conclude by looking at the bigger potential consequences here. Duncan is on his way out, but OCE said he might have broken federal law if he misused political funds.
As @pkcapitol notes, this OCE report raises some interesting issues. Should members reconsider spending campaign dollars to fly family members to political events? Either way, we bet it happens a lot.
Did the spending involve family? Well, lots of family members had formal and informal roles in the campaign. Did it involve friends? Well, lots of friends were campaign donors, volunteers or longtime supporters who deserved thanks: https://t.co/Gg6qySaFN5
Duncan and his wife called these expenses campaign-related and thus legitimate.
The picture gets even more vivid when you read about baby showers and bridal brunches at a private Knoxville club -- plus seemingly related gifts: https://t.co/fbqxJE0arN
Here are a couple of examples of the spending we're talking about here: https://t.co/2uJosVhpAG
“They are not traveling to political events, throwing parties or purchasing club memberships to enrich themselves or  live a more lavish life,” the lawyers wrote of Duncan and his wife, Lynn. The full response -- it's a long one -- is here: https://t.co/f5L3qmpu6m
Lawyers for Duncan sought to rebut OCE's case with a couple of arguments. First, Duncan had no knowledge of any of the spending and shouldn't be held accountable. Second, virtually all of the spending had what they called a "campaign nexus."
It paints a picture of a longtime representative with a tendency to involve family members at all levels of his campaign infrastructure -- one who allegedly spent more than $100,000 on travel, experiences and gifts for those family members and various friends.
Their report is here: https://t.co/Z6qgDVwicB
@CongressEthics wrote quite a report, which was released today. Investigators reviewed thousands of pages of FEC records for Duncan's campaign fund and leadership PAC, plus credit card statements, travel records, correspondence, etc.
@RepJohnDuncanJr says he's always considered politics a family affair. Now, his apparent use of political funds on travel, lodging, meals, gifts, parties and incidentals for family and friends is under scrutiny: https://t.co/Nmuu4gBf8G

This is a long-winded way of saying: look up a reporter if you've experienced or observed something that should be part of a reckoning, this one or another one. Also, read my story: https://t.co/4drx3cGHtx
That reckoning is ongoing and we reporters are here to listen and check stuff out. The process is not always easy on sources, especially for #MeToo stories, and we know that. But we rely on you to help us cut through the stuff that clouds what's real.
Some people think that's changing. In some cases? Sure. Broadly? I think not. While we're "reckoning" (I know, I know) with workplace harassment, some members need to consider whether they're running family tribes or offices staffed by professionals.
Many staffers -- particularly young ones -- absorb an implicit lesson. It's that your purpose is not so much serving constituents or advocating for policy change on the Hill. It's about ensuring your boss has a smooth ride to reelection, even if that means burying misconduct.
It has struck me in the last six months that even as politics becomes increasingly professionalized, congressional offices remain among the most tribal environments in the space.
The detail that sticks with me is what Anna Kain said about turning off her phone's WiFi to ensure she was no longer on the House network when she Googled the Ethics Committee.
And of course: what actions can we expect from members who confront misconduct allegations against trusted aides? Is OHEC applying garden-variety employment law in an environment that requires more accountability and nuance?
Do members do enough to ensure their staffers treat each other well? Is the considerable power wielded by chiefs of staff appropriate? Does alcohol, to the extent it becomes a problem, play a role in the dynamics of harassment?
This case brings together a lot of important themes -- and questions -- about how Congress operates.
The House Admin. Committee provided a reminder: "each member makes the final decision" on the legal documents they sign. Esty could have suspended or terminated Baker in May 2016. She could have demanded different terms for his exit. She chose not to, and has regrets about that.
Esty said she felt shoehorned into a system designed to protect members of Congress from the consequences of their bad behavior. She also suggested that OHEC, in its effort to protect individual members from legal backlash, can sometimes undermine the values of the House itself.
This gets back to the role of House Employment Counsel - the group of lawyers that represents members of Congress in employment cases. They've come under scrutiny since #MeToo hit Capitol Hill last fall. Esty said they urged her to sign an NDA and provide Baker with a severance.
In a lengthy, at times emotional interview, Esty took responsibility for not doing enough to protect her staff. At the same time, she argued that she was pressured by House lawyers to manage Baker's departure in a way that made her uncomfortable.
A couple of highlights from our version, which includes exclusive information from the NDA signed by Esty and Baker and tidbits from the letter of recommendation they cowrote for him to use in his job search.
Their article is here: https://t.co/xCGiR7qTTQ
We reached out to @RepEsty last week about sitting down to discuss the case. After I interviewed her Monday at her Ct. home, reporters in the state began hearing that something was afoot. As sometimes happens, we got beat in the final hours -- this time by @connpost.

A few days ago, attorney Arnold Reed insisted Conyers would not resign or plan his retirement after facing multiple accusations of sexual harassment. Now: "We're going to have discussions about what his future plans are. ... We're not going to let this languish and continue."
Shift from Conyers attorney about congressman's future: possible resignation "something that we will discuss, I'm sure" in the coming days. Conyers still hospitalized in Detroit.
@rachaelmbade Our updated story on today's Hill harassment developments -- Farenthold, the OOC data and the House Ethics review: https://t.co/RZfHWGgPwt

@rachaelmbade Updated story: https://t.co/yhlgv32E9Q
@rachaelmbade Here's her story -- ours updating shortly: https://t.co/ysp6rhzQhM
Go @rachaelmbade, who confirmed the $84K was Blake Farenthold's settlement with Lauren Greene. We figured as much.
Here's what to take from that information. That little-known Treasury fund that pays for lawmakers' settlements? OOC says it only paid for one settlement involving alleged sexual harassment on the House side (cost: $84K) in the last five years.
New info from the OOC, released by the House Administration Committee: https://t.co/lESf5afQek
@myhlee Here's the first cut of our story, which we'll be updating: https://t.co/ccCIEcS58Y
@myhlee "A nice change of pace to see the Ethics Committee asserting its jurisdiction.  Usually they are looking for ways to avoid taking on hard questions, hoping the Members leave or burying the allegations until the 'heat' goes away. This time the 'heat is too hot!'"
@myhlee But to outside experts, it's looking like a step in the right direction. Here's what one told us.
@myhlee It is unclear exactly what the Ethics Committee will do with the information it receives. Will it make the claims and settlement information public? Will it punish offenders? (And with more than a slap on the wrist?) We don't know yet.
@myhlee Leaders of the panel just asked the Office of Compliance -- best known for running the counseling and mediation process -- to hand over all records pertaining to claims against people currently working on the House side.
Coming soon from me and @myhlee: House Ethics Committee to look at all formal claims of sexual harassment, discrimination, retaliation and other misconduct against sitting members, current staff.

ICYMI: McConnell was on Fox News last night and made two interesting comments related to the harassment debate.
One issue is whether or not to maintain the Treasury "slush" fund. Some object to getting rid of it.
Among the topics discussed: how to protect victims who don't want to be identified. Whether old settlements should be released or just new ones. How to track new settlements.
We understand Pelosi just held a large meeting on sexual harassment with lawmakers, attorneys and victim advocates -- about 30 people in total. They discussed how to amend Speier's bill to reform the OOC/reporting process.

@washingtonpost For those wondering about the Local 4 report: Reed says it is not true. (Detroit TV station said Conyers will announce plans in January not to run for reelection.) Doesn't mean it won't happen, but Conyers's lead spokesman is denying it tonight.

@washingtonpost Lawyer Arnold Reed said it's an "ugly scene" around the Conyers home. "When I went over there, [reporters] were out there like vultures. Mr. Conyers is awfully concerned about that. This does not involve his family."
@washingtonpost More: "These allegations are untrue, and Mr. Conyers wants the public to know they are untrue. We will weigh and continue to assess his options, and as the CBC indicated, whatever decision is made in the end will be the congressman's."
Conyers has no immediate plans to resign, his attorney tells @washingtonpost: "The congressman is a very deliberate person and doesn't want to make a hasty decision."

@RepJoeBarton One last little tidbit to weigh. On the phone, Barton suggested he might involve the Capitol Police merely because the woman *kept* the explicit material: https://t.co/gUhiqSIi7W

@RepJoeBarton For those wondering about the revenge porn issue: good question. We  listened to the tape. Barton brought up the Capitol Police because he  was mad the woman learned about and was making contact with his other  lovers. She was mad; he brought up the idea of an investigation.

@thamburger Republicans at the event stood by Moore. Some acknowledged Corfman's allegation might be true. But then they said they didn't believe her.
Here's my initial story with @thamburger about Moore's appearance this morning: https://t.co/LidYodZoYB
And Larry Hogan, Maryland's GOP governor, said Moore is "unfit for office and should step aside": https://t.co/7ADTKh9Z8G
A few things have happened since I put down my phone. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) weighed in: https://t.co/cuZOjGwnj2
I'm putting Twitter down for now to interview voters. Be back in a bit.
Moore did not respond to shouted questions.
Then he left in a big SUV (just out of frame). https://t.co/ZRr4FKKJd6
As soon as he stepped through the door, this guy stepped in front of it. https://t.co/665UMbjI0M
He greeted a few supporters, then headed to an exit behind a phalanx of aides and friends.
Moore has finished.
At the same time, he says, he does not engage in negative campaigning.
@pkcapitol "In the next few days, there will be revelations about the motivations and the content of this article."
@pkcapitol "To think grown women would come forward" after decades, with the election around the corner, is "unbelievable." Crowd applauds.
@pkcapitol He denies serving alcohol improperly and committing sexual misconduct.
@pkcapitol These allegations are "completely false and untrue," he says. He mentions his long marriage and his belief in protecting children.
@pkcapitol He is now addressing the allegations. He said the Post started an attack on him and his wife after he won the primary.
@pkcapitol Moore is now reciting the Gettysburg Address from memory.
And this great analysis from @pkcapitol: https://t.co/r5Xgc59VAT

@MooreSenate Moore is now reading a story written by @SenJohnMcCain about his (McCain's) imprisonment in Vietnam.
@MooreSenate Moore is talking about the need to appreciate the Constitution. Listening to him, you'd think there was nothing happening in the news.
@MooreSenate No reference yet to the allegations in the Post article and no disruptions.
@MooreSenate He's starting his main remarks. Theme: public service and cultural decline in America.

@MooreSenate Just heard from my reporting partner that @MooreSenate is outside.
@MooreSenate At this point, the room is packed.
@MooreSenate The Republican meeting is proceeding with its routine. Pledge, prayer, introductions. Veterans were asked to stand. (Happy Veterans Day.)
@MooreSenate (Note on that: I should probably revise down the number of Republicans in the room. There are some Democrats here - I would guess maybe 10.)
@MooreSenate A leader of the local Republican chapter thanked the media for being here. She asked Democrats in attendance not to disrupt the event.
@MooreSenate (@MooreSenate not yet here.)
@MooreSenate The event is getting underway.
@MooreSenate I was not sure they would allow media inside (including the Washington Post). But here we are.
@MooreSenate Inside the library, it's a lot warmer. There are maybe 130, 150 Republicans here. Biscuits and coffee are from McDonald's. https://t.co/cccAoChXu8
