Said Biegler, "One of the things I think that‚Äôs happened historically - not just with the church but society in general...I think we‚Äôve not listened to the victims. I think the people in power have controlled the conversation."
In Wyoming, retired Bishop Joseph Hart could face criminal charges for decades-old allegations. It wasn't a grand jury or police that reopened the case against him but his own diocese, led by current bishop, Steven Biegler. At the end of the day, we need clarity and justice.
Take the first American bishop to ever be found guilty on criminal charges of covering up abuse, Bishop Robert Finn in Kansas City. He stayed an active bishop for three years after the conviction and still ministers in retirement.
There have been few consequences for bishops because no clear policy for bishop accountability exists. ‚ÄúThe bishops simply do not have anyone looking over their shoulder,‚Äô‚Äô said the Rev. John Bauer, a Minneapolis pastor. ‚ÄúEach bishop in his own diocese is pretty much king.‚Äù
The analysis shows that the claims against more than 50 bishops center on incidents that occurred after a historic 2002 Dallas gathering of U.S. bishops where they promised that the church‚Äôs days of concealment and inaction were over.
At least 15 bishops and cardinals, including Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the former archbishop of Washington who resigned in July, have themselves been accused of committing abuse or harassment.
While Catholic bishops have removed hundreds of credibly accused priests from ministry since 2002, about 1/3 have been accused of covering up abuse, themselves, often breaking the policies they themselves created 16 years ago. More takeaways below: https://t.co/5xYyP9D5sY

@jeremykusnir @jensenoffcampus Temple says no one will be displaced. Englert mentioned that last night before he got cut off but neighbors have taken 'we shall not be moved' up as their rallying call.
A lot of people thought Temple's Town Hall would end exactly as it did last night. Where do talks with the community go from here? https://t.co/6bAngYFTOM
This wasn‚Äôt the first gathering about the stadium to end in protests. https://t.co/i0Dqd5XFLU
Worth noting: In Englert's (unread) planned remarks he pledged to have on-going, regularly scheduled meetings with community and promised to enter into signed community benefits agreement. "There may be disagreements about aspects of this project," he wrote. "But I'm optimistic." https://t.co/tEisBmq47q
Here's my story from the very short-lived @TempleUniv town hall about the football stadium tonight. https://t.co/dnKs1HtUSU
‚ÄúI understand we need to do a better job of listening to our neighbors,‚Äù Englert says prompting another round of jeers. Program ends again.
Temple new library will be done in early 2019. Community members will have access same as Paley Library, Englert says.
Englert promises community an early learning and mental health center, Laborers Union training facility, investment in Amos Rec Center.
Englert now back at the mic continuing with presentation. ‚ÄúNo one will lose their property or homes if the project moves forward‚Äù
RT @IngaSaffron: Rev. Moore, a stadium opponent, makes passionate, eloquent  plea to hecklers to let @TempleUniv go on with presentation. ‚Äò‚Ä¶
Whether Temple will go on with meeting/presentation is a moving target. They‚Äôve canceled the meeting like three times and then rehuddled.
Rev. Moore, member of stadium stompers, addressing crowd now. Asking crowd to listen but Englert was just ushered out by security.
Temple admins are huddling to decide whether to proceed. Room still packed. https://t.co/LltySLrdjr
Community has been asking for town hall for months, presentation was planned and Q&amp;A but lots of anger here making that impossible.
It‚Äôs unclear if they‚Äôre going to resume. Protesters are now chanting ‚ÄúShame!‚Äù
Temple ends public town hall less than ten minutes after is starts after protesters shouted over Englert.
As Englert mentions no residents will be displaced group of protesters starts chanting ‚ÄúDown with the stadium!‚Äù And now they‚Äôre ending mtg
Boos at mention of creating a special services district. Englert says neighbors would not pay for it.
Englert says stadium facility will include new and diverse retail spaces, together providing 100 part and full time jobs.
Englert ‚Äúbuilding our own facility means substantial savings‚Äù Says another long term lease with Eagles doesn‚Äôt make financial sense.

Among people here are members of Temple Faculty Senate who voted 24-1 last week to oppose stadium RN/ further study it.

Meeting is rotating between public comment and scheduled speakers, chants erupting after every one.
Temple public meeting next week is during student Spring Break, Dobkin points out.
‚ÄúWe can take a 20 minute train ride to one of the nicest football stadiums in the world,‚Äù Dobkin says about Linc.

Says people shouldn't have to put up with pot smoking across from where they live, Ross says.
"This is not about this is center city and this place deserves it," Ross said. "We do not minimize the plight of anyone's living situation."
Ross says police still looking for second person. Says patrols have increased in park, plans to maintain presence.
Commissioner Ross says shooting was "very targeted incident." Offender knew targets, he said. Targets knew suspect by name.

"It will be a constitutional feast," says Nat Constitution Center director.
@mdent05 @MattGelb I hope they expand it to TV. @VeepHBO  #showmeprezbartlett
Constitution Center will be  PoliticalFest hub in July. Last time it was Convention Center. (where I accidentally went for press conf today)
Kenney thanks "our Republican friends," at the Union League, says collaboration shows this is a Philadelphia event not a party event.
"(DNC) isn't going to be a bother this is going to be an exciting event for everyone," Rendell says.
Historic announcement: Union League (founded as a Republican club) has agreed to take one of those donkeys to display outside, Rendell says.
Political board game tournament also coming. Rendell asks Kenney if he'll take on Clarke. "I'm already doing that now," he says.
Rendell says they'll have Q&amp;As with actors here who played presidents in movies.
DNC officially announcing PoliticalFest today. It's expanding this time to include seven locations with Phlash bus transpo between.
From yesterday: @Darrell_Clarke floats alternative soda tax plan https://t.co/vRVKMxvOGs He said today there's ongoing talk, no one proposal
Clarke said today he wouldn't talk about specific soda tax alternatives and proposals, said his job is to provide info to councilmembers.
RT @mdent05: Speaking of Allan Domb's idea to tax diet soda, too: https://t.co/qPZsGx4vX1
Council President Clarke and Harold Honickman just ducked out of Council chambers for a chat. It didn't last very long.
Domb wants efficiencies in gov to pay for tax but says taxing diet broadens base. People w/more money drink diet, he says.
Sidebar: Distributor Harold Honickman is at hearing today and he told my colleague he'd absolutely pass the tax on. https://t.co/GigAG69iAN
Gym: have you asked distributors how much they expect to pass on? Dubow: They're saying they would pass it along.
Health Commissioner Farley: Milk, water and any fruit juices are exempt. In general, that's what's served in schools.
Sanchez said looking at first year alone city needs $54 mil to initiate programs. "You mean to tell you there's not $54 mil?" Dubow says no.
@MariaQSanchez doesn't buy there's no savings in a $4 billion budget. "Did departments realign budgets based on priorities of the mayor?"
@CouncilwomanBRB said Arksansa &amp; W Virgina both in appeal process to pass soda tax. Solicitor says he'll look into both legal situations.
@Darrell_Clarke breaks to introduce ammendment to transfer $2 million to increase Park &amp; Rec employees in Special Proj Unit
Dubow again insists tax would be sustainable. 55% fall out in consumption built into projections, he says.
Reynolds Brown says if goal is sustainable source of revenue, why not tax a broader base of products with wider consumer base?
@CouncilwomanBRB asks if admin considered a container tax (tax on bottles) like in Baltimore. Dubow said it doesn't generate the revenue.
Councilman Jones just delivered a seemingly very pro tax speech. "Yeah I'm for saving jobs..."but I'm damn sure for saving kids," he said.

City Solicitor Tulante says it's not a sales tax because its on the transaction b/w distributor and retailer. "No requirement its passed on"
Greenlee: How do you proejct 55% drop in consumption and also say you don't think bulk of tax gets passed on? Dubow: Conservative budgeting
Dubow says Mexico and Berkeley are the only two examples we have. Clarke notes Berkeley had referendum. "They voted for it."
Clarke on Mexico comparisons: Would you acknowledge that's about as close as "apples and trees," not appropriat model?
Clarke shows map of households below the poverty line &amp; corner stores. "I want acknowledgement consumption is primarily in low income" areas
Clarke wants to know if goal of tax is health or revenue. Dubow says it's revenue and the intiatives it funds.
Dubow says liquor by the drink revenue has gone up in recent years, concludes testimony, asks for questions. There will probably be a few...
Dubow says city's figures are based on noncompliance rate of 10 percent in the first year and the full cost of tax passed onto consumer.
Dubow says property tax already increased four times in last five years and biz and wage tax reductions "essential to creating jobs."
Finance Director Dubow says SDT only way to bring in $95 million per year to fund pre-K, community schools, Rebuild.

Jones asks for names of the top three insitutions with owed city taxes. "We want to get the ones who can't run." Breslin says info to come.
Philly is owned $33 million in taxes by people who live outside of Philadelphia or PA, Revenue Commissioner says.
Revenue Commissioner Breslin says question better for OPA. "We rely on their assessed value."
Domb: Total value of real estate in Phila has stayed at $134 billion past three years. "Reasonable to assume RE market has gone up 4 or 5 %?

Dispatch from the rally today where President Clinton and a protester largely stole the show. #PAprimary  https://t.co/I0SEPKKCKo
Clinton wrapping up now, "not just about winning its about how many people vote, we need a big turnout."
"You don't learn anything when you're talking"
Protester is still at it, been shouting over Bill for past five minutes.
"They were wrong too and they don't like to listen either."
Clinton defends crime bill from 90s as she keeps shouting over him. He says she reminds him of when GOP  blamed him for financial meltdown
Clinton: Hillary was first to say get non violent offenders out of jail. Protester keeps yelling, hard to understand her. Now HRC chant.
Clinton: Hillary didn't vote for that bill, she wasn't in the senate, she was spending time getting healthcare for kids.
Protester shouted out something about Clinton "three strikes". Protester telling over Clinton. Clinton: "I listened to you you listen to me"
Clinton: Need good jobs in clean energy, modern infrastructure. Need training programs.
Someone in direct eye line of Bill is holding a "Hillary is a murderer" sign. Yikes. Appears to be only protester here
Bill on Hillary's plan for 1/2 billion solar panels. If you think that's California talk, check out "your neighbor, New Jersey"
Clinton via Yeats "Too large a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart." Protest, but think, he says, don't "make a stone of your head,"
Clinton "If I were age of these students and I knew what I know now, I would still choose to live in America" Echoes Obama: "We're so close"
Clinton says Philly gave him two elections and his Pa-bred son in law who weeps every time the Eagles lose.
Clinton: "thanks to Villanova for the first time in 15 years I won (bracket)"
Pres. Clinton takes stage. https://t.co/nov1B9BmLl

My write up from all things Bernie in Philly today with @ByChrisBrennan  https://t.co/eEtWmMOVqW
"On April 26 make sure Pennsylvania is part of the political revolution," crowd goes wild, music plays. That's a wrap.
Sanders on Trump. The Amercian people have learned what all religions have taught us, at the end of the day "love trumps hatred."
Sanders: This campaign is listening to women. And women are saying they are tired of working for 79 cents on the dollar compared to men.
"We should be talking about making colleges and universities tuition free. This is not a radical idea. This is a very common sensical idea"
"I don‚Äôt think you are qualified if you supported virtually every disastrous trade agreement which has cost us million."
Sanders going hard on Clinton. She says he's not qualified to be prez. He lists reasons he thinks she's not qualified: SuperPac $, Iraq vote
Sanders takes the stage: "Thank you, Philadelphia, what a tremendous turnout" https://t.co/vkcKEBwElk
Bernie on decriminalizing pot: Marijuana is not heroin, shouldn't be federal crime, he says. *Very* loud reaction from this crowd.
"It seems to me to make a lot more sense for us to invest in our young people in jobs and education (cheers) and not in jails." #paprimary
Sanders hitting on all his points: corrupt campaign finance system, broken economy, income disparity, broken criminal justice system
The noise level in here really is rivaling, if not surpassing, most sporting events I've attended.
Koch brothers (booos) spending $900 million in this campaign cycle to elect candidates who elect the wealthy...not democracy, oligarchy
Sanders takes the stage: we have a loud, large raucous crowd...it sounds to me like the sound of a political revolution."
Sanders is late because he's addressing overflow crowd in second location before arrival here. #PAprimary  https://t.co/oiVDtnoBtV
Overheard at the press table as crowd in Philly goes WILD chanting for Bernie. "He has no chance here." (He trails Clinton 6 pts in Pa).

Sanders says polls show him beating Rep. candidates. Says he'd do everything in his power to block a right wing extremist from presidency.
Last ?: Worried you'd be painted a radical and what that could mean in the general? Sanders: Consider what Clinton would be painted as (1/2)
Sanders said its no secret Clintons are popular with minority voters, part of the reason he doesn't do as well there.
On filling the deficit: Raise taxes on wealthy Americans, big corporations, look at gov. agencies, like defense department for waste.
Sanders: I don't want to see American troops sucked into ISIS. "perpetual warfare. We could be there forever."
"Here is a guarantee, write it down. Bernie Sanders is elected, take any bet, the Dems win the Senate" https://t.co/k183OaCz5t
Sanders said Obama should have mobilized the American public in a way he did not, relied too heavily on hope of working with GOP.
"I don‚Äôt claim to be as good a politician as Barack Obama." but "our campaign like his is generating enormous amount of excitement." (2/2)
Sanders asked if he sees parallels with Obama campaign. Does Obama‚Äôs experience give him pause? (1/2)
On free public higher ed: "Mark my words, sooner or later public colleges and universities will be tuition free"
Sanders said he sees role as prez also about "mobilizing the American people to demand that Congress do what has to be done"
1st ? on trade. Sanders:I believe in fair trade not unfettered free trade. Now can I give you a detailed plan, no but this is what I believe
Sanders tells ed board "I honestly believe we have the possibility of pulling off one of the great political upsets in  history of America"

Council President Clarke: one cent vs. three cent tax a big difference. "No ones gonna eat the three cent difference."

Tolson says part of streets department challenge is plows take 2-3 minutes per street but smaller streets requiring bobcat take 30-45 min.
All through-ways should be passable by end of day Wednesday.
Goal is that every street in city will receive a plow, Kenney said. People taking cars out, getting stuck haven't helped.
Kenney says when he was a kid city "never plowed smaller streets"
Kenney: We need to get primary streets as clear as possible. I recognize if it's your street it's important to you
Free parking all day tomorrow, too, folks. No kiosk or meters enforced.
Kenney warns not uncommon for fires to occur in these post storm conditions, asks residents to clear snow off hydrants.

Trash collection will resume tomorrow. Tuesday collection will occur as normal. Sanitation trucks had been used as plows.

Nutter is a "lead surrogate" for Clinton campaign. Went to South Carolina week before Christmas.
Nutter says he will continue work on DNC and will be active on presidential campaign trail for Clinton.
Real answer: he's taking a break but staying in Phila. Says corporate sector, think tanks have all come calling. But he doesn't know yet.
What will Nutter do next? "I'm going to take over the anchor chair at Fox 29." He's got jokes. Even on the last day.
Nutter says faith has also been key to leadership. He still has bible from his first swearing in. "Leadership can be a very lonely position.
RT @TriciaNadolny: Nutter on poverty: "This is a long term issue that we can't afford to take a long, long" time to solve.
On becoming more emotional: "It's not that I didn't have feelings before but something has happened over the course of these eight years."
Last Presser getting introspective now. "I've seen an incredible level of kindness from our citizens that goes above and beyond."
"At the end, there are facts," Nutter says. He says facts show a safer city, more HS grads, lower unemployment.
"The thing about legacies is generally, you don't get to write your own legacy," Nutter says. He thinks time will help shape his.
RT @TriciaNadolny: Nutter gives "credit and praise" to #PHLCouncil &amp; says "notwithstanding some of the news reports" they worked together &amp;‚Ä¶
Nutter thanks news media. "We've had a quite exciting relationship from time to time...received more than decent coverage."
Nutter now thanking cabinet members, commissioners past and present and his "Pope Five"

@Turtle19820 @6abc they only let us into the studio at the five-minute til start time mark. He'd already been make-up-ed.
@steveneumann11 @phillydotcom Oops. Live tweeting error. Apologies.
And that's a wrap. #nextmayorphl See the whole thing Sunday at 11 a.m. on 6abc.
Kenney channeling JFK. "We need to stop asking, 'what can you do?' What can we do?" to stop Phila brain drain. #nextmayorphl
They split on something (an hour in) Should Philadelphia keep sanctuary city status? Bailey against, Kenney for. #nextmayorphl
Q for Bailey HOW do you fund education when Harrisburg falls short? She says as city supervisors retire she'll replace each two with one.
Both Bailey and Kenney say they'd keep Superintendent William Hite when his contract is up in two years. #nextmayorphl
Kenney, "I‚Äôm not a charter school opponent I‚Äôm a public school proponent," but says, "we need reimbursement." #nextmayorphl
Kenney says standardized tests do not enhance the schooling experience. Calls them a "testing industrialized complex." #nextmayorphl
Bailey calls high stakes standardized testing "the worst form of one size fits all." #nextmayorphl
Bailey: "It's easy to say you have good relationship with the teacher's union when you know how much $ they've put in your campaign"
If Kenney could solve the budget crisis? "I would tell them to pass the 1 percent income tax increase." #nextmayorphl
On release of officer names in police-involved shootings. Kenney supports release after 72 hours. Bailey says no to "full throttle release"
@Jim_Gardner asks point blank: Will Richard Ross be next commissioner? Both Kenney and Bailey decline to answer.
Bailey wants 500 more police in Phila and says she would pay for it by switchover to paperless government. It would save $200 mil she says.
Kenney compliments work of Ramsey in Phila but says Harrisburg needs harsher gun laws, specifically legislation to report stolen guns.
Q for Bailey. How do you drive down violence? She says more activities for kids b/w 3-6pm also impose mandatory minimums on gun crimes.
How high should minimum wage be? Kenney says "whatever the economy will bare when it comes to collective bargaining." #nextmayorphl
How will you address poverty? Bailey says she can bring jobs here, specifically call center jobs. Kenney says universal pre-k, port jobs.
In Kenney's one-minute opening "We're going to make sure we have pre-k," jobs that can sustain families. #nextmayorphl
Bailey opens saying  she's a mother who knows what it's like to "wonder whether your kid will be safe at the playground." #nextmayorphl

Nutter apologizes for "intemperate remark" thanks media, says his mother will probably call and yell at him. #popeinphilly
What happened to the prison chair? Reporter shouts out   "Congressman Brady took it," laughs all around. We're friends again. #popeinphilly
@Michael_Nutter's favorite #popeinphilly moments: the plane door opening, the embrace with prisoner at Curran Fromhold.
Nutter: "I think sometimes if we could be a little less defeatist, down...citizens would probably appreciate that." #popeinphilly
Nutter says in some cases the media "scared the shit out of people," reporter responds, "As did you," "Walk for miles?" #popeinphilly
But he says those crowds had to eat somewhere "no one packs granola bars for days."
On business complaints: "this was never billed as a huge economic impact event, or money maker," Nutter says. #popeinphilly
Secure area could only hold so many people, Nutter says, "you run out of space." #popeinphilly
3 incidents were a DUI, probation violation &amp; "one complete idiot" who sought to bring large amount of illegal substance thru magnetometer.
"Wasn't about how many people were going to come. It was about the event. The event was successful." Nutter on #popeinphilly
Nutter says city doesn't have attendance number. Defends whatever that number is. "It's not our responsibility to be crowd builders."
"I can't even believe this morning we're in the same city where all those visitors were," @WMOFDonna says of #popeinphilly transformation.
