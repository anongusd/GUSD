Obama takes ISIS threat to US so 'seriously' his Admin still can't find Orlando shooter Omar Mateen's wife &amp; media hasn't bothered to ask.
If Obama logic alleges GOP 'rhetoric' exacerbates the Sunni ISIS threat, I wonder what Obama secretly funneling Shia Iran $400m does.
Obama today said the threat ISIS poses to the US is serious. So serious, his Admin had intelligence reports scrubbed of any mention of them.
Obama March 26, 2016: "They [ISIS] are not an existential threat to the US."		Obama today on threat ISIS poses to the US: "It's serious."

It would be a much bigger moment for women if the 1st female nominee didn't need to fake a marriage with a serial cheater to get here.
Hillary doesn't represent all women. She's only ever fought for elevating and advancing the interests and pursuits of one woman: herself.
I'd love to be more excited about a woman accepting a nomination for President. It is a huge deal for women. I just wish it weren't her.
Watching this...how could anyone ever think or question whether or not Hillary would be indicted by the same party throwing this convention.
Hillary is very lucky to have Chelsea. Nobody has ever done a better job than she just did trying to convince us that Hillary has a soul.
Whoever thought it was a good idea for Obama to lecture about self-appointed saviors also saw no irony in this one: https://t.co/r1Ed9I9o3s

Days after having their party's entire nominating process exposed as a rigged game, how can Obama lecture anyone about democracy?
Dems have spent past 2 yrs trying to convince us Hillary is too confused to work email &amp; now she's the most intelligent candidate ever?
There has never been a woman more qualified to be President than the woman who can't name a single accomplishment of hers to Wolf Blitzer.

The most honest admission by FBI Director Comey during his Capitol Hill testimony was that he had to go to the bathroom for an hour.
Hillary allowing her lawyers, who didn't have a security clearance, access to her classified emails is in and of itself a felony.
That isn't for him to decide. Comey is not a prosecutor. His job is to investigate. This is a complete whitewash. https://t.co/PRvLPs5MwG
To say that she didn't lie to the FBI, and to the American people, is an absolute lie. https://t.co/L6aHGa5ksZ
Comey sounds more like Clinton's defense attorney than the Director of the FBI.
Comey: Clinton might not be "sophisticated" enough to note "c" for classified. Pretty damaging argument for someone running for President.
FBI Director Comey testifying on Capitol Hill: "Hillary set up her private email server for convenience." SHE DOESN'T HAVE THAT OPTION.
The Obama Admin seems as concerned with his disappearance as they are with finding Omar Mateen's missing wife. https://t.co/oUbnOP69Yh

Senate leaders saying "voters should have their say" on SCOTUS. Shame GOP establishment won't adopt same logic with Republican primary.
McConnell's right: let voters pick in Nov but that msg won't get through w liberal MSM carrying his/Hillary's water. https://t.co/uE0f4rEsbG
Obama is capitalizing on the division on the right &amp; they are taking the bait w Garland. Divide &amp; conquer so Prez Hillary can nom a liberal.
I can see left saying: "The right's blocking reasonable Garland as payback bc he prosecuted the 'right wing extremists' in Oklahoma City"
Obama may say "violent" Trump supporters are blocking Garland as payback for prosecuting OK "right wing extremists" https://t.co/3t8h29WqhR
R's ARE right on policy: Constitution doesn't state that Senate must act. But Garland is so moderate that blocking him makes R's look bad.
Precisely Obama's calculus: R's will take bait &amp; block a "reasonable" nom. Then left paints them as obstructionists. https://t.co/9BcdjGedro

There's 1 final, desperate phase to the GOP establishment's inevitable, deserved demise: join w/ the left &amp; blame Trump for staged protests.
Left stages anti-Trump protests. Protestors blame cops for brutality. Media blames Trump for both. Obama &amp; Hillary weigh in, blame Trump.
"If Trump becomes President we can expect more protests like this" - current &amp; future talking point/threat of deeply threatened Democrats.
Deeply Democratic Chicago is a failed city thanks to the policies of the left, not the right. More misplaced anger.
These riots in Chicago. The left is so petrified of @realDonaldTrump.
After laying down &amp; dying for Barack Obama in 2012, Romney laid down &amp; died for the establishment. Again. The damage is politically fatal.
There are two Americas: the powerful &amp; connected on the right &amp; left, &amp; the American voter who isn't. On the right, the voters are winning.
He's right. The elites caused this. For the establishment, this is a fight for their very power &amp; existence.  https://t.co/yjCdrO95Sg

Trump ripping Rubio for being a war mongering, makeup wearing basketcase. He's basically callling him Ricky Martin in camo.
Having @ChrisChristie's endorsement pretty much destroys the argument that if it were a two man race, Trump would lose to Rubio.
"I think the media is among the most dishonest groups I've seen" - @realDonaldTrump. Populist and 100% on point.
"I wouldn't accept [his] support" - Trump on Mitt Romney. So smart.
"I voted for McCain and he lost. I voted for Romney and he lost. This time I said I'll do it myself" - @realDonaldTrump in Ft. Worth, TX.
Who is the better and more brilliant antagonist: @realDonaldTrump or @marcorubio?
.@marcorubio was on fire last night but will his tone &amp; type of attack work? Trump just crisply called him a sweaty, choking beta in makeup.
An indisputable lesson learned thus far in the 2016 election: whatever most of the media elites are saying, think the opposite.
"Once a choker, always a choker" - Trump on Rubio, using a football kicker analogy that most Americans-esp working class men-understand.
Once again, @realDonaldTrump completely shifts the news cycle off of his opponents and back onto him. Masterful media strategy.
Even Trump haters secretly know that voters want to see Trump &amp; Christie take on Hillary &amp; Bill. It would be an epic political sight.
W/ voters clammoring for a fighter to take on Hillary, having @ChrisChristie as a sidekick is smart. NJ &amp; NYers are the toughest around.
America, meet @realDonaldTrump's attack dog, @ChrisChristie.

President Obama inists keeping Gitmo open hurts our relationships with other nations. Gee, I wonder who that could be.
Come on, GOP candidates...waiting for you to rail Obama this AM on indefensibly releasing lethal terrorists back into battle. Where are you?
Jihadi propaganda never mentions Gitmo. Only propaganda we're hearing is coming out of the White House. There's no good reason to close it.

W's brother advocating for the Sunnis. A top fundraiser of his, Ignacio Sanchez is a top lobbyist at DLA Piper who reps Sunni Saudi Arabia.
That was good answer by @tedcruz but it assumes that Muslim refugees aren't already prone to radicalization no matter where which is naive.

Tomorrow's editorial question: Can Republicans throw deeply blue, ISIS terror target, post 9/11 New York, under the bus?

Reagan's pollster Dick Wirthlin used to say "motivate by reason, persuade through emotion" @tedcruz is using reason. Trump is using emotion.
.@realDonaldTrump is consistent with the counterpoint. Cannot get a glove on him.
Not a lot of conservatives come out of Manhattan. Daaamn.
Excellent question on Bill's past but it should have been posed to one of the equivocators who think Clinton is off limits like Jeb &amp; Kasich
.@MariaBartiromo is elevating the conversation.
.@realDonaldTrump made @nikkihaley look petty. And petty on behalf of the establishment is a bad look.
Oh boy. These two.
Now, the rest play Who Does the Establishment Hate More...@donaldtrump &amp; @tedcruz
Wow. @realDonaldTrump &amp; @tedcruz prepared but this sounds like a deal gone bad.
Does anyone get they might run against @HillaryClinton who bases her entire campaign on women? Might want to bring up Europe's rape crisis.
If @realDonaldTrump linked rape in Germany to how American women are in danger w importing male refugees that would've been a better answer.
First time the word "asunder" has been used in a Presidential debate &amp; not a love song.
Somebody's been studying. That was the best answer W's brother has given yet. His parents must be BEAMING.

DHS has a secret policy that prohibits "reviewing the social-media messages of all foreign citizens applying for VISAs." WE ARE FOOLS.
Watch what ppl do, not what they say. What Obama's doing from importing refugees to not suspending VISAs to emptying Gitmo helps jihadists.
Before we see photos of him in mom jeans, biking &amp; eating shaved ice in Hawaii Obama gave today's press conf to pretend he cares abt terror.
Wives won't have husbands &amp; kids won't have their dads this Christmas bc they died capturing jihadists. The same jihadists Obama's freeing.
Americans are dying every day to kill &amp; capture terrorists &amp; Obama is RELEASING THEM to rejoin the fight. This issue should dominate news.

Obama's DOJ could pressure companies who allow jihadists to use their networks. Instead his DOJ pressures citizens to not criticize Muslims.
Obama forgot to mention we aren't bombing ISIS oil fields for climate reasons &amp; he had staff downplay ISIS intel threat pre 2012 election.
Obama did more than just wag his finger at the constitution. He extended a very specific finger &amp; flipped it at the First &amp; Second Amend.

Both warmongering  Republicans &amp; backwards liberals like Obama will defend Islamist Turkey who is letting ISIS  move resources. Insanity.
The USA cannot go to war w Russia bc of intramural Sunni-Shia wars within Islam. It is CRAZY. If we were smart we'd toss Turkey from NATO.
Turkey doesn't care abt Western security. They have a 500,000 man army within a few miles of ISIS and they have not lifted a finger to help.
Turkey shot down that plane because Russia is bombing their rebel allies trying to get rid of Assad. Islamist Turkey is not our ally.
Are ppl really suggesting we go to war w Russia over Sunni Turkey when they are likely aiding Sunni ISIS? We should throw them out of NATO.

Hollande was right when he said we should keep refugees close to their country of origin. This is why US must make Arab states step up.
Finally the question that needed to be asked but it wasn't from the American lap dog media. The French press does not play.
I thought President Obama said he didn't do joint press events with leaders running for re-election. Just Israel's @netanyahu, I guess.
Obama: wait til they get a load of us at the Climate Summit in a few wks...."a rebuke." Because nothing scares jihadists like the weather.
"There have been moments when we have failed to hold up our American ideals." - Obama. Yeah, a looong moment that has lasted 7 years.
Looking forward to hearing the response from the socialist on the stage who is proven at community organizing. But enough about Hollande.
You will hear lots of words from Obama at this press conference with French PM that mean absolutely nothing.
Compassionate conservatism is out. Common sense patriotism is in. It's time to put America, and her citizenry, first. #americafirst

The left wants to ban or restrict guns in case a gun is used to kill. Why wouldn't they apply same logic to refugees who the govt can't vet?
It's not that those who oppose refugees think every refugee is a terrorist. It's that you can't trust this govt to weed out those who aren't

Hillary, did you not know they wanted more security or did you and couldn't get the funding? Which one is it? Pick a story.
If a consulate is attacked 2x prior &amp; the nearby British embassy/Red Cross closes &amp; Amb says he's not safe how could you not pay attention?
She can't follow record keeping laws, can't tell classified info, didn't see security requests. At best, she was not up to the job.

His plan is actually pretty good. Makes the case to stop handing so much money to foreign governments who hate us.  https://t.co/wLwGhdLdOo
Putin doesn't want to destroy US, ISIS does. He wants to restore respect &amp; regional dominance lost during Cold War. https://t.co/hYVY78WAnm

Russia is not a gleaming democracy, never has been. We gotta grow up &amp; deal w it. If he's willing to stop ISIS we should ask how can we help
Regarding Islam, Russia is riddled w radical Chechens &amp; Dagastanis in the South who commit acts of terror. He has every reason to stop ISIS.
Putin is an authoritarian dictator in the mold that has ruled for centuries. While not a good guy, we have great reasons to cooperate w him.

Tonight on @oreillyfactor Kim Davis returns to work tmrw. What is the best solution since she refuses to resign? We debate at 8pm ET
The lack of realism in our elites is astounding. This is why we're hated: we don't know how to use US power &amp; we're meddling busybodies.
The 11 democratic "freedom fighters" we trained to fight Assad won't take over if he falls, ISIS - a real threat to the US - will.
Assad is a thug &amp; a dictator but he isn't a threat to the US. Why are we trying to oust him so ISIS, a religious murder cult can take over?
Russia is helping Assad defeat ISIS yet I've heard the US call it "de-stabilizing." Do we want ISIS to win and control Syria? Are we insane?

Hillary apologizes, Trump v. Jeb and Kerry names a transparency czar at State - more wasted money. see you on @OutnumberedFNC in minutes!
It would send a bad msg &amp; be damaging to women everywhere if our very first female President was in over her head, confused &amp; incompetent.
Put aside the lies, Hillary clearly couldn't handle the responsibilities of being Sec. of State, which means she can't handle a higher ofc.
How can we trust Hillary with the national security of the entire country when we can't trust her with a blackberry?

Hillary isnt some solo rogue actor. Obama's whole Admin is rogue. Her emails aren't an outlier they are a modus operandi of a lawless Admin.

While it cannot &amp; ikely will not be overturned, an amendment can be added if people get angry enough. No other country has a law like ours.

THE HUG.
That answer from Rubio on immigration was on point and passionate. He shouldn't run from the issue. Be an advocate for legal immigration.
Trump is right. GOP has been scared to talk about illegal immigration. Some of the candidates on stage have been obessed with amnesty.
Jeb looks nervous. This forum is not his strong suit.
Megyn asked a question the Clinton camp would have eventually hit him on. It was fair. He had to be ready &amp; he was.  https://t.co/sUxRRKTgPm
These questions are really tough. Impressively tough.
Trump should have stopped after saying he doesn't have time for political correctness. The dig at @megynkelly wasn't necessary.
"I don't have for total political correctness." Masterful. @realDonaldTrump
Rubio should have nailed Hillary on saying the GOP is hostile to immigrants as a first generation immigrant. He is scared to go there.

Sanctuary cities are a core value of Democrats. Policies from Feinstein &amp; @HillaryClinton have created safe havens for killers like Sanchez.
Congressional Republicans should be passing stand alone border security bills over &amp; over daring Obama to veto. They'd be fools not to.

Bill: "when the tab comes due" we'll snap back to traditional. We're already bankrupt. Sadly, the secular liberal culture is here to stay.

Tonight on @oreillyfactor Bill argues the country will eventually snap back to its traditional roots. I say it's not happening. Who's right?
