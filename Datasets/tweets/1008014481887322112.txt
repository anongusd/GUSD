@WalshFreedom There's nothing wrong with debating the merits of such a high rate - eg how much revenue would that even raise? - but let's at least understand what we're debating
@WalshFreedom It's a marginal tax rate, meaning 70% of your income *beyond the proposed cutoff (I believe something like 10 mil?)* is taxed. Everything you make before 10mil is taxed at lower rates	Even someone who makes tens of millions of dollars a year won't lose 70% of their income.

@realDailyWire I disagree completely. I believe that true religion and true progressivism can exist in a society, and in fact are better off by the other's influence.		It was not much more than a century ago that American religious fervor and progressivism went hand in hand.

@MrFilmkritik Tbf neither of them have had any prior political experience.		Just don't want to see Oprah or Lebron as President in three years. One celebrity president is enough for a lifetime.
@politico I'm pro choice myself, but I think we as a party need to be a big tent if we are going to seriously pursue a 50 state strategy.
@ktumulty @Acosta I had to check their website to see if this was real or if it was indeed fake news. I encourage everyone else to do the same - because you won't believe it's real until you see it for yourself.		Shameful.

@thehill Lou just thought if he translated "crusade" into Arabic he could make it sound scarier.
@Lawrence @RandPaul I'm disappointed in his decision, but it's important to point out that he has voted against the President more often than Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, or any other Republican senator.

@justinamash Anyone who considers themselves a libertarian would do well to oppose Kavanaugh, especially in regard to the powers and privileges of the presidency.		(Personally, though we disagree on much, I was hoping for @SenMikeLee)
I must urge any Senators who may be leaning on the fence to vote down this worrying nomination by the President. @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski @RandPaul @JeffFlake @BobCorker @Sen_JoeManchin @HeidiHeitkamp @SenDonnelly @DougJones @MarkWarner @SenatorTester
Kavanaugh believes in an all-powerful presidency, unhindered by criminal or civil cases. I could not disagree more with such a broad view of executive power. And that he was appointed by a president under significant civil and criminal scrutiny is even more alarming.
@Jim_Jordan So many unscrupulous politicians are the most qualified and attentive person for the job- until they're in hot water, at which point they were too incompetent to know any better.		In other words, #ResignJimJordan
@FoxNews I agree @PatrickBuchanan. But that civility must go both ways.
