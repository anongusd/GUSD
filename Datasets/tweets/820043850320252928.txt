@oneboubala @LeahNTorres The Lord is making the woman miscarry after drinking the bitter water if she has been unfaithful, using abortion as a punishment. This is an act carried out by a priest. This is not a random miscarriage.
@oneboubala @LeahNTorres If the wife has had sexual relations with a man other than her husband she will miscarry after drinking the bitter water. That IS abortion.
@oneboubala @LeahNTorres The Lord causes the woman to miscarry if she has been unfaithful in this "test" where the priest gives the woman a bitter drink. That is about abortion. https://t.co/dN4i1eiGWQ
@oneboubala @LeahNTorres https://t.co/dN4i1eiGWQ
@oneboubala @LeahNTorres In it the Lord makes abortion (performed by a priest) the punishment for an unfaithful wife.

@Blkvelvt87 @BernieSanders Trump claims his wall will benefit American society.  He could easily start claiming it is a "socialist" program. "Socialism: An economic system in which the production and distribution of goods are controlled substantially by the government rather than by private enterprise."
@jwgop And then many of his supporters will refuse to support the Democrat that does become the nominee.
@BuckwheatS @JoshuaEli23 @BernieSanders The candidates you name will most likely drop out of the race relatively early, long before the nomination.  Bernie, on the other hand, will likely stay till the last days, no matter where he stands. And his presence in the race will continue to divide the party.
@DavidWright_CNN Bernie had a built in base from his prior run. Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar were both newcomers.  I find their totals much more impressive for that reason.
@Blkvelvt87 @BernieSanders So anyone that supports any type of public school or public roads is a Sanders follower? Trump wants your taxes to pay for a wall, which could also be considered a "socialist program".  Your logic doesn't fly.
@Blkvelvt87 @BernieSanders All the dems are NOT running on a socialist platform. Kamala Harris specifically stated today she is not a democratic socialist.
@JoshuaEli23 @BernieSanders Him throwing his hat in the ring again has done nothing but add division to the Democratic party, both from the "never Bernie" dems, and the "only Bernie" ones.  If he had stayed out of the race we wouldn't have this immediate caustic division. A 2016 repeat is now more likely.
@JoshuaEli23 @BernieSanders I have already been told by Bernie supporters in my local Indivisble group that they WILL NOT commit to supporting another Democrat candidate if Bernie doesn't win the nomination. So much for being "Indivisible".
@markhughesfilms @eugenegu I have already been told by Bernie supporters in my local Indivisble group that they WILL NOT commit to supporting another Democrat candidate if Bernie doesn't win the nomination. So much for being "Indivisible".
@eugenegu I have already been told by Bernie supporters in my local Indivisble group that they WILL NOT commit to supporting another Democrat candidate if Bernie doesn't win the nomination. So much for being "Indivisible".
@BernieSanders Very disappointed in your decision, Sir. There are so many other great DEMOCRAT candidates already out there. I hope your decision doesn't condemn us to a repeat of 2016.
@politvidchannel @KamalaHarris I hope Bernie Sander's supporters will do the same and if he loses the nomination they will vote for which ever candidate DOES win it.  Though I have already been told by some Bernie supporters they WILL NOT commit to doing this. üò°

@Christy56074523 @PattyMurray You are the "Mother of a beautiful teenage daughter" according to your profile. What will you do if she ever becomes pregnant with a WANTED pregnancy that goes terribly wrong and only an abortion can save her life?
@Christy56074523 @PattyMurray What question did I avoid? You asked if I was a baby lover as well a an animal lover. I am.  YOU are the one avoiding the questions.  What about ectopic pregnancies...which are WANTED pregnancies...which can KILL both the pregnant woman and the baby?
@Christy56074523 @PattyMurray Democrats are passing bills to SAVE WOMEN'S LIVES!  You are promoting the death of women and the removal of needed health care procedures.
@Christy56074523 @PattyMurray Ectopic pregnancies are WANTED pregnancies. What does birth control even have to do with ectopic pregnancies?
@Christy56074523 @PattyMurray Again, have you heard of ectopic pregnancies?
@Christy56074523 @PattyMurray I love babies and animals. I can do both!  And I love living breathing women, and refuse to sentence them to death over rabid beliefs.
@Christy56074523 @PattyMurray You think the "RIGHT side" is forbidding a woman from having a medical procedure that may be necessary to SAVE HER LIFE?  That is scary!
@Christy56074523 @PattyMurray You are spreading propaganda. Abortion is a medical procedure that is often necessary to SAVE THE LIFE of a woman. Have you ever heard of an ectopic pregnancy? And there are SO MANY other things that can go wrong. I support women's health care!
@KevinMKruse @soledadobrien Just be glad you are not a woman being actually, physically stalked by a creepy person like this. Women often end up being killed by creepy stalkers.
@Christy56074523 @PattyMurray And what about all the wanted pregnancies that go sadly wrong, where the mother is at risk of death?  You would prefer these women to die? May God have mercy on YOUR evil.
@GOP Comments like Pres. Trump's should be condemned by Republicans and Democrats alike. It is LONG PAST TIME for Trump to resign, be impeached, and/or be indicted.

@DanCrenshawTX Who will profit (as in $$$) from all these extra detention beds that you want?  Whose pockets is this GOP demand lining?

@RobLowe This tweet is not only racist, but misogynistic. Shame on you.
@JeffHJR87 @PattyMurray Stating "not interested" just shows you are not interested in the actual facts, and just want to spout your propaganda.
@JeffHJR87 @PattyMurray Google is your friend. Google the Michael Cohen court filings and read them.
@JeffHJR87 @PattyMurray NIce denial of the facts.  All will be known in time.  I expect charges against the President.
@1rarebird61 @ananavarro @EllenCotler Warren only repels many because she has been demonized by the right, and the press has played along and hyerpublicized their demonization. It is another "but her emails".
@JeffHJR87 @PattyMurray Michael Cohen is going to prison for this.  Why should Pres. Trump not be indicted as well. He directed the crime for the benefit of his campaign for President.
@JeffHJR87 @PattyMurray Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to eight counts in federal court, saying he made illegal campaign payments at the direction of "a candidate for federal office". That candidate, the unindicted co-conspirator, the person who DIRECTED COHEN TO COMMIT THE CRIME, is Pres. Trump.
@JeffHJR87 @PattyMurray "In criminal law, a conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime at some time in the future."
@JeffHJR87 @PattyMurray "An unindicted co-conspirator is a person who is identified by a law enforcement officer to have engaged in a conspiracy, but who is not charged in the indictment charging that person‚Äôs fellow conspirators."
@JeffHJR87 @PattyMurray What Trump did IS illegal.
@olystubbies44 @PattyMurray https://t.co/sY9KgKiXQz
@olystubbies44 @PattyMurray Again, as you obviously didn't read: "We have laws against infanticide in this country. This is a gross misinterpretation of the actual language of the bill that is being asked to be considered and therefore, I object."
@JeffHJR87 @PattyMurray Trump is an unindicted co-conspirator in the Cohen sentencing.
@JimTypeDude @PattyMurray Trump is already an unindicted co-conspirator in the Michael Cohen sentencing. And as the Mueller investigation gets closer to Trump and is children there will likely be more crimes revealed.
@olystubbies44 @PattyMurray As to our Senator, NO SHE DID NOT. Her comment was "We have laws against infanticide in this country. This is a gross misinterpretation of the actual language of the bill that is being asked to be considered and therefore, I object."  Stop believing propaganda.
@olystubbies44 @PattyMurray Yes Trump has, and he is an unindicted co-conspirator in a case already filed.

@ECMcLaughlin @ChuckGrassley They don't care if she was sexually assaulted.  Honestly, I don't think they want to know.  They don't care that Trump sexually assaulted many women.

@renato_mariotti And the MSM is ignoring most of them to focus on random stories about the right, and allowing WH propoganda people on their shows, as they think make them look fair and balanced in their reporting. Scary times.
@SpeakerRyan @VP Happy Birthday @VP.  May you spend your next one in prison.
@RepDennyHeck @realDonaldTrump If the GOP don't step up and do something we will lose this country if we are not able to vote them all out.
@RepDennyHeck @realDonaldTrump Keep fighting Congressman. Our country is in danger, and your GOP colleagues are doing nothing to stop this insanity.
@matthewamiller We are losing our country. CNN is currently running a headline "Justice report expected to criticize Comey" and MSNBC is running "Are you out of your mind? Mika responds to Giuliani"  The Trump distraction campaign is working very well.
@BBCWorld Thank you for reporting this to the world BBC. This type of brutality in America needs to stop.
@Dictionarycom But it also means "a small, flat, thin piece, especially one that has been or become detached from a larger piece or mass:" and Senator @JeffFlake is one small piece of the GOP that has become detached from the larger complicit GOP mass.  I wish there were MORE Flakes!

@JohnJHarwood How about this: I am a reporter of the Jewish faith. We are in Nazi Germany. I attend a dinner that Hitler is at. He is funny. I laugh and I write an article that says he is funny. My entire family later dies in the gas chamber.  Do you still call it nonsense?
@KamalaHarris Keep speaking out and fighting against this insanity, Senator.  Americans truly appreciate your willingness to step up and speak out!
@RepDonBeyer It is NOT funny and ALL OF CONGRESSS needs to start speaking up and doing something. The current inaction and normalization of this behavior will only put our country in danger.
@DanRather The fact that this type of behavior from Trump has been mormalized, and is now just brushed off, is incredibly frightening, and uur current Congress seems unwilling to do anything to stand up against this behavior!
@joncoopertweets Maybe the should all just march en masse to Mueller's office and tell him EVERYTHING that they know. Then America would applaud and support them.
@JennyWilsonUT @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump Seems like @MittRomney is a flip-flopper who will say anything to fit the specific moment, and is a man who WON'T stand up for his own convictions. Not someone I would vote for
