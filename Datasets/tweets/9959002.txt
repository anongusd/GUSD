@Elanier_dos @prepxtra @KnoxWebbHoops Congratulations to y'all!
@vhelsing1015 @spann Someone on MSNBC's twitter wanted to know if anyone has checked on Jeff Sessions. Too bad such a blinding hatred toward someone they can't see lives were lost.
@Rene_gadeCowboy @MSNBC @kasie Yes, I'm praying for all involved.
@BrowningStephen @MSNBC @kasie I don't think that part of Alabama got ht. It was a bit farther to the east. The County where Auburn is was where most of the fatalities occurred.
@Devin_Price3 @KAGS_Lucas @ConsolFootball @simplyCoachO @Coach_Hoyd Congratulations to you!

@Evelynromero193 @WHOhd Yes, I could go for that!
@IkeMorgan @aldotcom I'm praying for all involved!
@1967oldman @RealJamesWoods No, I don't support Hollywood. However, at a friend's house I did see one of those movies made by that church down in South Georgia. I think it was called Fire Proof or something.
@CaptainMabel Woman or man I believe abuse is wrong! However, I don't go to movies, because I don't support Hollywood. Not to mention the cost to go to theaters these days and the transportation to go there.
@RedBankHoops Thank you Seniors! We look forward to hearing about your future endeavors!
@spann Wow, praying for all!
@munderw341 @brooks_fletcher @EWErickson Some of the greatest people in the world live in South Georgia and if you were stranded on the side of the road they would stop and pick you up without asking whether or not you were a Republican or Democrat.

@Sherry_Hughes @WCPO It's too bad some colleges have their Spring break this week!

@insert_funny @PennyJJerald Funny! It took two colleges and six years before I got my degree. I was so embarrassed I did not go to my 10 year reunion. I went to my 20th year reunion because I figured everyone had screwed somethin' up by then. It was liberating!
@PennyJJerald Yes, if the person realizes thay've made mistakes, is teachable, and then ultimately willing to take responsibility.
@caddy_canada @SKYRIDER4538 @fedagentmark Or, employees who are black. For example, I'm not a blind person, but a person who happens to be blind.

It's optional so the students can go to Walmart or something if they don't want to go to the speaking engagement. Heck, when I was in college I didn't have time to go to them them things, anyway.
@tonym43202 @AndrewPollackFL @realDonaldTrump @TPUSA @benshapiro The thing is tolerant has become a word like moderation, because it is so misused. I'll truly listen even if I don't agree with what you're telling me. I might tell you what I think, but ultimately your opinion is just that.

@NBCDFW So, how come these people will come out and say ""I'm running for President." Then, a few weeks later have their campaign announcement?
@BearcatEd1981 @conservmillen Yes, I agree! These people fight for the rights of a few instead of many. How many times have you heard the media and politicians talk about senior citizens and the disabled.
@Cybernat2015 @DailyMirror You are correct! We as a society don't even take suicide seriously.
@ahumorlessfem @imillhiser @AOC Well, I am myself wherever I go. I know a well-known politician and if he is around people he'll talk to me. If it's just me or even my mom and I then he pretends not to know me. I don't care what your politics that's just low.
At the under 16:00 media time out Furman is leading Chattanooga 10-6.	#UTCvsFurman	#GoMocs
@ahumorlessfem @imillhiser @AOC Yes, and most of these politicians will maybe talk to you at a political event, especially in front of the media. However, a week or so later if you see 'me in Shoney's they pretend not to know you.

Now, I'm told the only recourse I have is to talk to an attorney, which it will ost money I don't really have.
@seal_kim @steph93065 @AOC @RashidaTlaib Yes, I've been there so many times. Have you noticed that if a politician and the media are in the same room with disabled person they will take a photo with you. The next week if you see the same politician at Shoney's they pretend not to know you.
@KTSMtv Yeah, some colleges in this area have their break next week. Seems kind of early to me.

@GregHarris71 @Ridgetrim @mike_moroski In the North, maybe, but it seems to me that homework assignments are so watered down. The answer has to be in the book. So, we have 14 and 15-year old kids who don’t know how to analyze and come up with an answer.

@scottsauls I agree, but if nobody else will fight for you then you got to stand up and fight for yourself and hope that eventually you will impact others.

@GreatSchools @NBCNewsLearn Well, why aren’t school systems working harder to hire more disabled teachers?
@NBCNewsLearn I was the only blind person in my high school, and it was an incredibly positive experience. I learned how it adapt to a different environment.
@Dale_Chu @JocelynAChadwic @KhaliaBraswell @NBCNewsLearn @INTechCamp Students with disabilities are underrepresented in the mainstream classroom. For the longest time we were placed in residential schools, which caused family separation.
@NBCNewsLearn Well, having students with disabilities in a mainstream environment helps other students feel more comfortable around disabled people and can eliminate some common stereotypes people have.

@buster21047 @JoeGorges @JosiahHawthorne @ShaneClaiborne You're absolutely right! The problem is the church has become part of the world. I've heard of pastors who will eat in restaurants and leave a gospel tract that says "You don't need a tip you need to be saved."

@Bmills775 As a kid growing up I used to love Earl Pitts. I was almost crushed the day I found out Earl Pitts was not a real person.

@tigrayrocks @lynnskyi @songbird328 @boltonnut @angelgirl1976 @boogiechild5820 Unfortunately, the student was not there for the academics, but for the athletics. Because of the school's accreditation the students we accepted were not exactly at the top of the class. One of the reasons why the school eventually closed.
@AftPitsnipe @ShaneClaiborne I'm not an atheist, but I will tell you this. I have gone to churches with people who need a heart transplant, and I'm not talkin' about the one a medical doctor would perform, either.
@ShaneClaiborne Wait, isn't this idolatry? I mean that is how some churches get in trouble, because they worship the pastor and not God. Man will let you down, but Jesus will not. All men are capable of sin.

@JefferyADoveJr @PGutierrez630 Seems to me kind of pointless! How does 'tis person know the book will be a life change for him? How will it be proved he read it? Will there be a quiz afterward? Will he have to write an essay?
@bpjauburn @Talkmaster @AOC Yes, it is evil! Look at the whole Terry Shiavo thing in 2005.
@Talkmaster @AOC It does not surprise me. A lot of these politicians don't want those of us with disabilities around.I've asked a few who they've done for the disabled and crickets.
@philp_michelle @LucyAlexanderTV In the United States disabled people get little coverage in the media. Stories like your sons need to be reported on to show that the disabled can and do have rich and fulfilling lives.
@NBCNews @NBCNewsBETTER I don't know how this will help people with disabilities, but okay. I reckon to the creators this is easier than public awareness.
@FiveRights That's the question I've been asking for the past couple of months. You are always going to offend someone. Also, why should put any stock in what someone I don't even know from Adam's house at says.
@cestlah Wall or not these people are putting others at risk. For example, people at school, the grandparent in the room, and organ donor recipients like me at risk. It really shouldn't be a political issue. It is a safety issue.
@wdefnews12 I wish we could have conversations on disability.
@BeckwithLeslie @DougRipleyODU @ODUWBB @ConstantCenter @ESPNradio941 @ODUMensHoops I've noticed the Southern Conference does that a less frequently than than they used to.
@NBCNews @NBCNewsBETTER It may not be the healthiest, but it's most people don't eat pizza everyday. Birthday cake isn't healthy, but I will enjoy a slice or two every once and a while. Moderation is key!
@lynnskyi @tigrayrocks @songbird328 @boltonnut @angelgirl1976 @boogiechild5820 I knew a college professor who marked a student absent one day, because he was banging around on his phone and doing everything, but pay attention to the lecture. The professor told the kid "your body was here., but your mind was elsewhere."
@joehaugheyIII @MZHemingway Yes, we are, but the Bible says we have to die daily to the sins of the flesh.
@NBCNews @MeetThePress @NBCLeftField For the disabled relatively little has changed.
@TrayveonNewton1 @webofootball1 @WEBOrecruiting1 Congratulations to you!

@santaarnold @tigrayrocks @boogiechild5820 @Instacart Yes, you should or at least close to the amount you ordered. You may want to go through and pick substitutions just in case the items you want are out stock. Also, if there is something you can live without you can go into the ap and select don't refund.
@santaarnold @tigrayrocks @boogiechild5820 @Instacart However, they give you that wiggle room in case you make a change at the last minute, you wish to change to change your tip, the item is out of stock and you request a refund instead of a substitution.
@santaarnold @tigrayrocks @boogiechild5820 @Instacart Usually, let's say your total bill is $50, but they charge your credit card for $65. Well, let's say your driver finds everything and no changes are made to your order then your credit card statement will say $50.
@shitarce @Talkmaster I like California Pizza Kitchenn, which isn't too far away from True Foods.

@RepStevenSmith If you go to the original thread and say that you will be taken to the lion's den by some rabid people. One person is so angry with me for having an opinion they blocked me so I couldn't respond. This is tolerance, I reckon!
@WRCB It depends on how wide they mean by diversity. If it includes how to communicate and interact with a disabled person then yes I could go along with it.
@Deja_Great @shiratarlo @mollyhc I have faced constant verbal abuse in the the workplace and I would not wish it on anyone. Now, I've pretty much given up people are gonna say whatever they want and there's not a lot I can do.

@teresainnj Can I ask an honest question. Is it bad to have an opinion that may differed from someone else? How come people get angry when people have an opinion that differs from there's? Oops, that's two questions, but I really do want to know.
@Deja_Great @shiratarlo @mollyhc Well, I personally oppose the drinking of alcoholic beverages and I'm not taking sides here all I'm saying is I'm not too surprised. However, I'll admit I don't know the woman personally so for all I know she could be the nicest person on Earth.
@teresainnj Not necessarily! I Aline more with the Constitution and I had problems with both sides of the hearings. Also, I have been yelled at work for things I did not do and it's not fun. In fact, I've been yelled at all my life.

@MollyMcKew Yes, discrimination of all kinds is systemic, but the media and politicians want to tackle a small part of the wound. Wouldn't it be nice if all types of discrimination were reported on? People want somebody to discriminate against, I reckon.

@zampella @ABCPolitics Yes, as a blind person I agree with you! However, when you tell people how you think that rarely works. I on the other hand do want people to ask my questions and be honest with me. I might be the one with the problem.
@LizaSoho @ABCPolitics At the end of the day I would rather have someone be honest and tell me what they think. As a blind person who tries to conform to society as much as possible I would rather someone come out and tell me why they don't want to go to dinner with me verses constant excuses.
@zampella @ABCPolitics Theat's the ting about an apology is you don't know how sincere a person is until they show it. A public figures, such as politicians, apologie more because they want your votes. In the end all you can do ask for the person's forgiveness and then it's in their hands.
@wellingtonmiley @ABCPolitics Yes, I agree! Maybe the way he said it was not right, but whatever happened to the days of someone having a differing opinion and I might not like it, but we either talk through it or move on.
@cincisterling @ABCPolitics You are 100 percent right. However, we should not have to learn a language just to communicate with the neighbor next door. I do see your point, though.
@techy_tellechea @ABCPolitics As a person with a disability you can educate, but you rarely do change minds. So, whenever someone brings up a stereotype. I just say "Oh, that's a myth." Then, explain why. The rest is up to the other party.

@tigrayrocks @angelgirl1976 @lynnskyi @nycki96 I had a great-aunt who would talk away, but she wanted you to talk she could repeat the gossip. However, most of her time was spent gossiping about people she didn't really know.
@tigrayrocks @angelgirl1976 @santaarnold @lynnskyi @nycki96 @tonysohl Yes, I tend to enjoy larger groups where you can kind of mix and mingle. Also, I'm a typical Baptist so it depends on what they are having to eat. For example, I love cookouts and church ice cream socials.
@NBCNews On the job, maybe? However, aside from that people can support whoever they want.
@NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK Well, there are other ways for kids to socialize outside of school. For example, a church youth group.
@TigOhhh @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK I started to say I think I saw this article on here last week.
@rangerwyld @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK I will say I was mainstreamed into a public school and had just as many opportunities as my sighted classmates. Any mistakes I've made since then I can't attribute to anyone else, but myself.
@rangerwyld @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK Well, bigotry exists in all kinds of forms. The disabled aren't treated any better.
@RadicalRuss @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK Yes, if you can afford to send your kid to a school who they are going to be prepared for Harvard and Princeton verses the public schools where the teachers do more disciplining then teaching. Then, it's a no-Brainer.
@wgrice03 @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK Some sort of school choice program so most parents are not necessarily locked into their neighborhood school.
@LouisParess @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK Yes, this is why so many parents are homeschooling their kids. The basics is the key and then other things follow later.
@joesmit61414142 @NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK They still do a lot of that today! I met a girl whose high school didn't not have a valedictorian, because they wanted everybody to graduate with honors. Then, on the other hand I had about another school who had 27 valedictorians.

@Kazzak_Mach @Resuna @CNET As a totally blind person I use voiceover on my iPhone to use my Fitbit. To sink the device you do need to use a code on your Fitbit to enter into your phone. You do need sighted assistance for that, but beyond that it's easy to use the phone app.
@Kazzak_Mach @CNET We could do that, but Apple products have voiceover. So, they are 100 percent accessible right out of the box. So, I don't know why a blind person couldn't use an Apple Watch.

@MSNBC @morningmika If one maybe two channels want to air it, fine. They have no need to all broadcast it. It is a speech not a tornado warning!
@Antamania1 @TIABABA0525 @MSNBC @morningmika There is plenty going on. They could talk about the McStay Family Murder trial or something.
@LourdesGutier13 @MSNBC @morningmika Most of those type of things bore me to tears. So, even if it were a relative I likely would not tune in.

@PreetBharara @laweez Why must we use bad language to tell the truth? If I wronged a friend then why can’t they just tell me what I did wrong?
@PreetBharara @laweez Neither are right. However, I would rather listen to lies than bad language.
@BKaysac Maybe? But it is not happening and won’t anytime soon regardless of who the president is.

@yeshua_porvida What I don't understand when people say "I'm tolerant." However, they come unglued when someone has a different opinion from them. Not to mention the lessons we are teaching our children.

@KB31_Era Congratulations to you!
@SteveShirt So, if it were a blind person would you tell us you were leaving so we don't end up talking to air?
@CbusPaulieD1977 @TheConservative @NBCNews Great! Now, we have yet another political discussion to look forward to at the Christmas table. However, I probably will not participate, because I have bronchitis.
@jelani_wendt Amen, congratulations to you! I remember the day I received my first acceptance letter into college, even though it was not my first choice it felt good to know I was college bound next year.
@jyoung2448 @BigJoeBastardi No thanks you can have it in your town, but keep it away from mine. The Storm of 93 brings back too many bad memories.
@apronman @Lawrence So, like at Christmas if someone comes unglued, because I happen to have a different opinion should I just tell them what they want me to say? How should I handle the situation?
@DJDublin @Lawrence I think the general public has to much on their plate to think about it. If the Russian thing was all I had to worry about I would be in a pretty sweet spot. Impeachment, as well.
@PAVH48 @Lawrence I don't really take what anyone tells me as gospel truth, even if it were my pastor.
@ChristineBende2 @RevChuckCurrie @RonWyden Politicians protecting us? That's like asking your thief neighbor to keep an eye on your house while uoi're gone for a month. They'll keep an eye on it, but not the one you want. Why go to Waffle House and expect a white table cloth?
@Jewels8031 @RevChuckCurrie @RonWyden Yes, but standing by the book and knowing the Book are two different things. I've been to church where the pastor might know 10 verses and that is what he preaches on and nothing else. We need to read and study.
@holly_taggart @fred_guttenberg I don't I'm hoping to celebrate with an iPad Pro this Christmas. The chances of this happening are about the same as a 90 degree day in Siberia, but one can always dream, right?
@living_my_story @fred_guttenberg Yes, it's too bad everything has to be politicize to the enth degree! I think the prayer breakfast was always around the 1st week in May. Are there two?
@cathyrusson @clarionledger I hope someday they can get justice for Jessica!
@Dolph82117178 @MSNBC Yes, I could go for term limits!
@LisaRosenbaum @MSNBC No, I don't think so! More gets done when they are not in session.
@Drew_Akins From this  Red Bank Lion congratulations to you! Playing y'all may not be quite so much fun this year, and I might not get to Dateline faster.
@DisneyNurseJen @NBCNews It seems to me like they take more time off than the schools. So, most of the year it's re-runs. In fact, on some Saturday Nights you get two re-runs of Dateline, a re-run of Saturday Night Live, local news, and another SNL re-run.
@PinkBelgium @PGutierrez630 @realDonaldTrump So, does this mean the small local marches are off, as well? I keep seeing things on twitter and Facebook about a women's march focusing on that teenage killer that they are trying to get out of prison.
@catclo @ChloeNooga Yes, sometimes nothing is as it seems.For example, in our local grocery store the air conditioning filters are next to the dog food. In Walmart the chili is next to the peanut butter.

@OneEyedORourke @NBCNews I don't know much more than you do, but what they call comedy now is not funny. Besides isn't humor in some ways supposed to be a bit sarcastic?

@HankHampshire @AndrewCMcCarthy It's too bad the cable news networks have become so partisan and work to divide the country even more. Why do people hang onto every word these people say like it's gospel?
@ChrisHoneycutt @FWCFlorence @PastorSteveFWC Amen, praise the Lord!
@duckyknits @nancyrector @realDonaldTrump Fox and Friends and all the other cable news networks carry is mostly editorial. I personally don't watch any of them, becaus they are just people with opinions.
@realDonaldTrump Well, like it or not Saturday Night Live is entertainment. Also, changing the channel or turning the set off are viable options.
@JeanieCStein @NBCNews Well, like it or not it's just entertainment. My television has an off button and I chose not to watch regardless of what the content was.
@geoffschwartz @ClayTravis If the Titans win today it would be a good day for Middle Tennessee after the New Orleans Bowl last night.
@StephenAShirley @BlueRaiderDJ @ChadInTheBoro @MT_FB Would the Boca Raton Bowl have been a better fit? Seems like Middle Tennessee and Northern Illinois would be two more evenly matched teams.
@blountstownFB Then, you go back and are gone for another hour.
@robeva1495 @paynej247 @NBCNews I assume he has the money to help combat suicide and/or bullying, which are both very important issues.
@paynej247 @NBCNews Well, I guess this person knows what it's like to be in someone else's shoes, now.
@TwoHauteMamas1 @KPRC2 I wish the national media would cover stories like this instead of their political rhetoric.
@Jen_Smilez @NBCNews @ruthbadergins Hopefully someday a disabled person will have a voice at the table. I don't think it will happen in my lifetime.
@fred_guttenberg Well, Sunday is supposed to be a day of rest. Tweeting from the bathroom is something I've never thought, but sounds kind of fun.
@lindalu1965 @farm_iowa @48hours Well, last night Dateline reran the episode about Brad Jennings.

@cestlah Yes, I can see your side of the issue and that's not the Christmas me talking. I'll let you know how my family Christmas goes. My sister has a new baby so maybe their will be less political discussions. Babies can change a routine in my favor.
@Heywhygodsdoin @PGutierrez630 @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Unfortunately, I've met con artists of all colors ,shapes, and sizes.
@pez1963 If you do the crime you should do the time! Also, the person was able to get a college degree on the taxpayer'sdime.
@Lucyandricky613 @NBCNews Yes, unfortunately, I think you're right. Also,out of the people that live in this country next to none who run for president are exactly awe-inspiring.
@ShaneClaiborne Let me explain something else. The airlines are not in a hurry to get disabled people off the airplane, especially if you're not connecting. I've actually set on the airplane for 30 minutes waiting for them to get me off. Even more difficult for your party to meet you
@YourStuffIsBad @NBCNews @NBCOUT Well, my parents knew a guy who had a stroke and had to go into a nursing home. He and his wife got a divorce so he could receive some kind of government benefit. This was not recently either.
@StacyGrantstacy @Kreager @ESBN_BA @CSmithScout Congratulations to you!
@TubaTekindor @cestlah Good going Nashville! At least this time you are in the news for something positive.
@paulosophia @saradannerdukic @theresamax @MelissaJPeltier I just hope we can all make it through Christmas. I've had a hard year and am not really in the mood for family political discussions. However, I guess like last year I'll tolerate it and tell people what they want me to say.
@saradannerdukic @MelissaJPeltier Good for you! I think so many of us are afraid to get out and make new friends, because we'll have an opinion and the other person will get angry and fly off the handle and walk right out of our lives. I don't need that right now!
@saradannerdukic @MelissaJPeltier Well, what if you have family members who get angry whenever you have an opinion that's different from there's. Last year I just started telling them whatever they want me to say. Whenever I voice an opinion it's time to change the subject.
@Jessbrooke_00 @AshlyVYPE @ETBU_Volleyball Congratulations to you!
@fred_guttenberg Why do people say "flat broke?"
@Scott_Pauley Good place! If only Nashville could manage to stay out of the national news, which has been a challenge for them in 2018.
@Trickyjabs @AFireInTheNorth Yes, whey do people get so angry at others who have an opinion that's different from there. So, I guess where all supposed to be like robots and agree on everything.
@cestlah In a few days I'll be with people who get angry with people who have opinions they disagree with. So, I'll say whatever you want me to say I need some practice. That's usually do with some of my family members.
@cestlah Maybe, but so much happens I can't get all worked up about it. There are sad stories all around us and some of us are living some.
@YupYurgin @NBCNews Yes, tha'ts true! I mean kids all over the country have had their last names made fun of. However, the parents didn't go to court and change the name. Bullying is wrong no matter who or what your name is.
@cestlah The kids in Colorado didn't have to die. They deserved a better father.

@MSNBC Somebody told me that if you were attending a college that closed you're loans would be forgiven. However, if you had already graduated your degree would be worthless.
@Beardeadbully @CNN Yes, I think we're already paying enough and seems to me like there might be bigger problems out then taxing text messages.
@nothink78 @CNN I can see your side of it, but for some people with disabilities who can't get out it would be a bad move. As a blind person text messages have saved me several times. What may help some would disadvantage others.

@ASEDawg89 @NBCNightlyNews @stephgosk Well, some people might live in towns where cab service is not a reliable. So, Uber or Lift are better. Then, you have grocery delivery services and the like.
@NBCNightlyNews @stephgosk While it makes sense it's not practical for some of us with disabilities.
@LorettaFletch18 @RockinCheri99 @foxie21460 @FOX2News Yes, unfortunately, you get to a point to you think there is no way forward. Reaching out work might work, but some people will just shrug it off and say "Oh, you just want attention." Or, "don't you think you are being dramatic here?" Later it's too late for tak backs.
@jala_da @RockinCheri99 @foxie21460 @FOX2News Yes, I've had a hard year and this year like most years I'm having a problem finding my Christmas joy. Some folks think you can just put on a hat and Christmas will be merry.
@RockinCheri99 @foxie21460 @FOX2News Yes, that's true! People need to try to understand where the person is in life. For example, November and December are hard months for a lot of people, but if you say something like "I'm not looking forward to Christmas this year," people come unglued.
@foxie21460 @FOX2News Exactly! We should take suicide seriously. Also, strive o be encouragers and not joy-stealers, good listeners. Most importantly let the person know you are there if they ever need to talk.

@revcoltom @PaintingPastor @albertmohler Fine, but why does it always have to be about race. Why aren't we talking about disabled people in the church and how few of them there are?
@GHMansfield Why aren't organizations that deal with diversity working with us to address these issues. Hopefully we as disabled people will have a place at the table.
@sbamodel @hardball @Mimirocah1 Sounds like a neighbor of mine. One week he'll say a truck pulled in front of my house with a Hispanic and a Black Male in it. The next week the truck had three people in it all Hispanic. So, which is it?
@PaintingPastor @ShamelLakins Something did happen at a church where I was a charter member that I didn't think it was right. So, when I went to another church I told the pastor my side of the incident in case it did come back to haunt me in a letter.
@NBCNews No, bring back Friday Night Lights!
@JackPosobiec @HenshallHarold I think it was on 48 Hours before Winchester pled guilty and lead investigators to Mike Williams body. I'm wondering if Dateline is in Tallahassee, but can't confirm or deny either.
@jimmygards So, I reckon you got a Houston Solution in mind.
@JackPosobiec @HenshallHarold Denise Williams is a woman on trial in Florida who plotted her husband's murder. She could get life in prison. The killer pled guilty and got 20 years in prison. Mike Williams death she went on to marry the killer who testified against her yesterday.
@jerbergmann @NBCNews I've been to St. Louis once and I don't care if I ever go back. I worked with someone from Kansas City and the slightest thing caused her to come unglued. I know where I'm not moving to.
@TZeliznak @NBCNews Yes, I'm glad I don't live in Missouri. The city people sound like angry, bitter people.
@Mark923to25 @HenshallHarold If it doesn't fit their radar then the story does not exist. According to the cable editorial networks there are at most four things happening in this country.
@JackPosobiec @HenshallHarold I wish this did something to me, but it doesn't. So, wake me up when there is news in the Denise Williams case.

@Peace_Unleashed @CardiacKembaa @hulu I hope you are right there, because they took Friday Night Lights off of Netflicks and put it on Hulu.
@Peace_Unleashed @CardiacKembaa @hulu Yes, in theory they should have alredy done so according to ADA, but some businesses drag their feet as long as they can.
@GregoryMcKelvey Wow, I'm glad I graduated when I did and we did not have a police officer in my high school.

@WinstonTechnol1 Where is peanut butter?
@MattBarx @realDonaldTrump Hey, that's my game! I hear words on the television and use them all day. For example, "tight as a tick's behind." It's fun game, you know.
@MichaelJAltman Maybe a book about the Holly Bobo case.
@ShaneClaiborne That would be an interesting trial to have listened to!
@BigOrangePruitt @BenBriley Y'all got WIVK and an S&amp;S Cafeteria.
@BigOrangePruitt @BenBriley Yes, why's the rich man busy dancing while the poor man pays the band.
@BigOrangePruitt @BenBriley Utopia? I've never heard that before. Public transportation is a joke. However, as of today we do have a Cheese Cake Factory.
@gbos_23 Wow,  I'll sure be praying for him!
@MayorLeeHarris @PaintingPastor I'm praying for all involved!
@SuttonEli21 @NatlPlaymkrsAca @GatorsFB @crob45 @theBAFootball @BuckFitz @RivalsWoody @bartonsimmons @CoachDanMullen Wow, Congratulations to you!

@GordonnBombay @andrewjatkins @nytimes @ndn Yes, these national sources are tryin' to talk up global warmin'. All I ask is they keep the cold weather out of the South. It's fixin' to be so cold here Tennessee Volunteers fans have already started burning next year's season tickets.
@dbv154 @andrewjatkins @nytimes @ndn I got to meet a New York Times reporter once. However, I didn't make it into the New York Times. I mean I told the revival joke and everything!
@MarkScarborou91 @LaneBuban @BryanISD @bryanvikingband @CityofBryan @BryanISDSup @theeagle @KBTXNews @BCSChamber Merry Christmas to you, as well!
@PastorJohn2005 Happy birthday! Hope you get the corner piece of cake! Great people were born in December. My birthday was Saturday.
@tahirajh @NBCNewYork That's odd! Seems to me like you could see and/or smell the difference? Did the bottles feel the same?
@Lrihendry Nashville needs to own up to it's own faults. They started off the year who was having an affair. Throughout the year the city has made the news for all the wrong reasons. Now, this is how they want to end the year!
@Kenneth_Walker9 @TNGridironScout @johnlhunter1 @CoachClawson @coach_craw Congratulations to you!
@Inoalot2 @HenshallHarold @Kimbraov1 @gatewaypundit The overwhelming majority of these people are from outside the South. The most recent disappointment was Tim Scott.

@DrDonKAnderson I, too, will be praying for the meeting!		The college I graduated from is facing a North Carolina school in the New Orleans Bowl.
@gnesem @fred_guttenberg Actually, other than the media the Russian thing is off most people's radar. To them this is the equivalent of us getting an iPad Pro for Christmas. I'm more excited about the New Orleans Bowl.
@UberFacts Well, I'm a typical Baptist I like to eat!
@martytravels @NBCNews Yes, I'm not Catholic, but I thought they were not supposed to get married.
@fischerll69 @MSNBC @FoxNews Bad idea all the way around! All these cable editorial networks need to go or get back to all news. These networks divide the country!

@JWilkersonWNML @CentralFball014 @CHSCOACHBR @ghsfootballstat @alcoafootball Congratulations to the Bobcats!
@fiumiamifan @FLgridironpreps @UMichFootball @GatorsFB Congratulations to the Panthers! It's too bad the media doesn't want to give Conference USA schools the recognition they deserve.
@KDuke111 @BVEvery @RecruitGeorgia @RmaCoachP @coachseiler_ksu Congratulations to you!
@robints Happy Hanukkah out there to those who celebrate it!
@Ju_Not_Jew @JBeasleyWSMV Yes, how could you have 12 players on the field when it's your last shot to win the game. Middle Tennessee actually had some decent chances yesterday to win.
@NickWhite0 @VBCBoston Amen, praise the Lord!
@BreitbartNews The mayor said he want going to come if Kid Rock was in the parade. After all his town went through earlier this year he needs to work on uniting his city not dividing it.
@RikiRachtman No, some people think they've dotted our accent even though they haven't.		If your Southern accent sounds like another language you're one of us.
@sgt_buckeye @philsteele042 Yes, it's too bad Conference USA is such a low-rated conference that we get all the bowls that nobody has heard of. I mean it's better than staying home, but Middle Tennessee has done better.
@FlightofaEagle @philsteele042 @ConferenceUSA @SouthernMissFB They didn't even sneak at te minute like Middle Tenessee did last year.
@michaeljack @philsteele042 It sounds like to me minds were made up already before the game was played.
@Alex_w04 @Jeff_XOS @MtnBrookFTBL @Yellowhammer247 Congratulations to you!
@BlazerTalk Yes, I think Appalachian State has finally gotten used to the move up from the Southern Conference. They were a good Southern Confeence team, as well!
@427L88 @RepChuck I hope you have a Merry Christmas, as well!
@RepChuck Happy Hanukkah to those who celebrate it!
@DrJonMJenkins @RealBrandonJenk Wow, I'll sure be praying for y'all! Please keep us updated when possible.
@bridgetownfiner @jimkiefer1952 How could not like twice baked potatoes? They are much better than once baked potatoes.
@PascoSheriff That's what I love about Sunday!
@R1ckterScale Bowl wise did UAB really do better than Middle Tennessee?
@JustinForUAB Yes, I'll wait and see what happens next year. What I was excited about was that we played some big name schools and got our name out there.
@DanCardenMP Congratulations to you!
@_cingraham Yes, unfortunately in most elections it comes down to which is the lesser of two evils.
@tobennna @UberFacts I was wondering the same thing! This sounds like one of those radio station trivia questions. Valentine's Day, Super Bowl Sunday?St. Patrick's Day?
@WLWT It seems like we go through this every year. What song will it be next year? "I'm dreaming of a white Christmas?"
@MikeOrganWriter @LipscombMBB @MT_MBB @Tennessean @gmathews_24 @caseyalexander @MTCoachNick Yes, it's definitely a rebuilding year for the Blue Raiders. Maybe they can turn things around when conference play starts.
@joypainlife @UberFacts Yes, sad, but true! I'm as guilty as anyone. I mean I watch Dateline, 48 Hours and find most of the episodes captivating.
@livpresent @NARAL Amen, I agree!
@pack_of_camels @TheJordanRachel @JacobAWohl The same b word that deprived Kid Rock of being in the Nashville Christmas parade.
@TheJordanRachel @PGutierrez630 I know I'm from East Tennessee, but am I missing something here. Was this supposed to be like one of them jokes that the pastor tells in church and someone gets it and starts laughing 5 minutes later?
@LoLoWil12 @GPowers79 @Perroni247 @techjohnsondog @Dunne_Football @MikeRoach247 @FlightSkillz @TO98_Kroog @JoeHamilton__ @adamgorney @EJHolland247 Wow, congratulations to you!

@BigOrangePruitt Or, She Shed!
@JbananaOfficial @WyattEarpLA Yes, and I don't understand how people can hang on to these people every word like it is gospel. This is man's opinion and should be taken as such. It is fun to see them unglued, occasionally, I agree.
@JoelEdmonson @WyattEarpLA Yes, I give none of them the time of day. They really are not even fit for breaking news.
@WyattEarpLA @JohnVassNascar You are correct! These are all cable editorial networks and need to go or return to the all news format they started as. All these networks divide the country.
@yruwhining @MSNBC Funny! I thought they posted this story last week. I reckon it was so newsworthy it needed to be posted a second week. All stories like this do are divide the country even more.
@jmcraz8 @GoMiddle It's a great night to be a Blue Raider!
@MoonShineTD @jmcraz8 Thank you Marshall! For the rest of my life no more Marshall jokes!
@friend23456 @MSNBC Yes, it's Thanksgiving weekend and the cable editorial networks are working harder than ever to divide the country.
@MetzgerDee @MSNBC Yes, that's what politicians do! How frequently have we heard "we are gonna raise your taxes! It's for the children." "The schools need more money."

@BlondeHistorian @alexhaagaard Yes, when I was in college I would be walking down a sidewalk or hall and someone would say "Where are you trying to go?" I would reply "I'm going..."
@Social_Mands @alexhaagaard @intowildplaces When I was in high school sone students would ask if I needed help getting to a certain classroom. If it was the beginning of the year or something  I would say "I don't think so, but can you walk with me to make sure I know where I'm going?"
@Dannilion @ughkatagain @alexhaagaard Yes, I thinking is fine! However, if it is a situation where it is a college student and they have their arms full of bags then it's acceptable to say "I'll get the door fo you!"
@mcautigers Yes, the Meigs County Tigers had a great season!
@johnthedude_ @GrandpaGio @cc32399 @CaguamaDaddy That's correct! There are a variety of missions trip that could range from doing something in your surrounding area to possible going overseas. Your short term missions trip to another city is more common, because it is much cheaper.
@cc32399 @CaguamaDaddy Yes, churches raised money for missions trips long before gofundme.
@song_bird1987 Yes, I'm pretty sure google home works like Alexa where you can set a musical alarm.

@random_atheist @fred_guttenberg @thereal_hair All go back to all news, which is which all these channels did a good job doing at first. I wish to hear news not what someone thinks.
@changemustcome7 @fred_guttenberg @cammonsey @FoxNews All these channels that started out as news are now mostly opinion and have their own agenda. I give none of them the day of day.
@fred_guttenberg Seems to me all the cable editorial networks do is cause division. So, it's time for them to go. They are not an encouragement to anybody nor particularly informative.
@fred_guttenberg @YouTube I don't have no time for these television talking heads and their editorial opinions. If I was bored out of my mind then I might tune in, maybe.
@Redted797 @fred_guttenberg @YouTube Yes, the cable editorial networks are pointless! They're a ton of things I'd rather do than sit around and listen to somebody else's opinion whether I agree with them or not.

@WhenPigsFly @hroethgar @BethBakerRS @Spoolses @Steffalompen @RespectableLaw @TheNewAgeOfOhm I usually will listen to what they say whether I agree with them or not. The problem is most of them who come to visit you tend to be about as dry as cracker juice. Occasionally, you'll get someone personable and talkative, but rarely.
@stevewymt It's fun to go to Walmart and easedrop on the conversations and brawls on Black Friday. I hope you have a good trip to Florida!
@spakhm @m2jr Yes, I agree to a point. However, they are people who can be introverts at the office and extroverts at home. With that said I have worked with some very serious people who think their opinion is important and if yours is different stand back.
@resolvingdust @m2jr I guess my point is if we meet someone in an airport and we tell them something we think is funny we don't know if their grandma was just diagnosed with cancer, if we find funny they don't, their personality, etc.
@resolvingdust @m2jr Seems like to me we're human and have good and bad days. What I find funny on a sunny Friday may not seem quite so funny on a cold, cloudy Wednesday when I am struggling to get to the end of the month.
@m2jr @getongab Yes, I have met someone who do not have a sense of humor and when you say something funny they became unglued. So, you have to back the truck up and say "Oh, bad joke!"
@resolvingdust @m2jr Now, when people make jokes about my disability it depends on the intent and how well I know. Is it a friend I see fairly often or an usher at church making a joke about me to impress his buddy.
@resolvingdust @m2jr As a person with a disability I can see both sides of the story. I find sometimes making a joke about my disability a way for others to get comfortable and ask my questions about my disability.
@paulosophia I would be in favor of doing away with the two party system and letting more viable parties have a decent shot. However, I know why they don't.
@JJSebastianelli @GatorsWewa @coachbjohns It's too bad the national media is not reporting on this, but going on with their agenda. Also, that coaches are portrayed s country bumpkins who just know sports.
@MdwithNYBlood13 @bessivon @CBSNews Yes, I get that it was an open and shut case. However, I think he should have stood trial and faced the death penalty. However, I get the fact her family did not want it nor the pain and stress of going through trial.
@DrBobParker Wow, that's great news! Congratulations to you and your family.

@CarolynnRachel @DatelineNBC @dateline_keith I did some research! Dateline aired the story two years ago. However, it looks like some things have happened since then.
@TheLancerLink Dateline Will rerun this story tonight.
@cgnetwork Dateline is reairing this episode tonight. Maybe some more things of happened since then. I don’t know!
@edod2002 @fred_guttenberg I second that.
@Rambobiggs @NaplesRocks Yes, I would be for a system with more than two parties, especially one that more involves Christians and the values we stand for.
@TrumpsAsianChic @cordia_83 Yes, I don't understand why the media is so tore up about it. In fact, they were so tore up about it they took the Florida panhandle out of the news the week of Hurricane Michael.

@ShannonBream Either way it's better than what I got!

@Blake_Ewing @realDonaldTrump I don't know! It kind of sounds like somebody playing a joke. People travel. Every Thanksgiving. So, I don't know why it's news.
@jehawbaker Yes, it seems the older you get holidays definitely aren't like they used to be.
@DylanDreyerNBC I hope you have a very happy Thanksgiving!
@PascoSheriff Yes, I'm ready for the Baptist super Bowl!
@PascoSheriff Happy Thanksgiving to you, as well!
@SnoringDoggo @GHMansfield That's right! You notice when minorities are mentioned people with disabilities are rarely mentioned. We are a family of all races and classes.
@NASCARNAC @JohnVassNascar Amen, I've never asked how any of my family members voted. If they want to vote for their microwave then that's their rite!
@TonyaReid911 @WXII I reckon if you write books about what you know you ain't supposed to have them published. Heaven forbid we make someone feel uncomfortable by reading your fiction book.

@Elena77h @AmiHorowitz No, because I imagine like here they have their own agenda, as well.

@ThinBlueLine614 @1967oldman Amen, praise the Lord!
@EdPiotrowski @Macys Yes, I am glad I'm not there!
@AdamDunlap01 Yes, I kind of feel the same way. A friend of mine was talking about how he thought he had overslept 24-hours. I thought "I wish I could do that."
@KPRC2Ryan @KPRC2 I hope you have a happy Thanksgiving, as well!
@buzzman888 @RodStryker Amen, preach on! I hope you have a happy Thanksgiving!
@JamesTorrez_NC9 @RockyTopSkiBum @newschannelnine I like it, but I can't have it, becausee cranberries interact with my antirejection drugs I take for my kidney transplant.
@NoahsArks1_2 Sounds fun! I hope y'all have a very happy Thanksgiving!
@NAARobertWilson @NHLFlyers @Eagles Wow, I'll be praying you will get well soon!
@malikmcconnell1 @CoachGrabowski7 Amen, praise the Lord! I'll continue to pray for your full recovery.

@DougRipleyODU Yes, long swim!
@KPRC2RoseAnn @KPRC2 Happy Thanksgiving to you, as well! I had a heart attack this year. So, I'm thankful to still be here. Also, I'm thankful my 11-year-old kidney transplant made it through the arteriogram.

@ChrisRowland9 @gbroh10 Happy Thanksgiving to you, as well!
@BrianaWhitney This I can believe!
@wbir Yes, I'm sure his victim had an option, as well!

@ReporterHannah @newschannelnine @cleveland19news Good luck!
@KeyandraMason @dreamarlowe85 Congratulations to you!
@Dr_H_Rodriguez Wow, I have some distant cousins who graduated from Plano High School. Their high school had 4,000 students for two grades. I'm glad I wasn't invited to neither of their graduations.
@ChrisDavisMMJ Yes, in the South we say dressing.
@KennyCTucker Sounds fun! I hope you have a good visit!
@VidCon There is no gravy!
@Dr_H_Rodriguez Praise the Lord for a safe trip! I hope y'all have a good visit! What part of Texas are you visiting?

@nbcwashington How come they always seem to have corny names?
@TerryLLawson @BenjaminNorman Years ago I cut my teeth on high school football in Florida, South Georgia, and South Alabama. The Cairo Syrupmakers was one of many teams I covered. You practically had to go around Robinhood's Barn several times to get a score from down there.
@TerryLLawson Glad to hear you're doing well! I had a heart attack this year. Thankfully, I didn't have to have open heart surgery, but know recovery can be slow.
@ricktillisTN Congratulations to you!

@theaggie96 The gym?
@IsraelUSAforevr @John_KissMyBot It's too bad the cable editorial networks are going on with their agenda instead of reporting on Thanksgiving stories like this.
@TomAhernCPD @ChicagosMayor I will be praying for all involved!

@hoody_two_shoes @KZKX969 @WatchChad @Lauren_Alaina @lukecombs Yes, I agree! They say today's country is about like 70s pop.
@SgtMincy643 @CameronWRCB Yes, I agree! I've lived in both Rutherford and Davidson Counties. I miss Middle Tennessee!
@CameronWRCB Congratulations to you!
@lynnskyi Yes.
@lynnskyi I just read another incident in Philadelphia.

@Pete5474212I live in a cold blue collar state, but I hate snow, and like cake. Pass me the corner piece. Whoever invented round cakes should be shot at dawn.
@_Sales_007 @CBSNews Yes, I ain't never been to Chicago and don't care if I ever go near that place.
@AnnCoulter It's fun to sit back and watch the cable editorial networks come unglued about everything.
@bearski55 @mmpadellan @laweez Wow, such nice language. Sad this is the only way city people can come up with to disagree with someone. Have a great evening.
@JenReadsRomance It's funny! I knew someone who got transferred up to Minneapolis and he and his wife loved living there. Then, they got transferred to Portland, and they did not Portland, OR. For them I think it was more the climate.
@Pete54742125 @DeadlineWH @MSNBC @ZerlinaMaxwell @NicolleDWallace Being a member of a party is not the answer. In fact, seeing how divided this country is I'd be in favor of doing away with the party system. We need revival!
@PhilHollowayEsq @paynelindsey @upandvanished Yes, that would be about the only way they could get a fair trial. That's what they did in the Holly Bobo case, anyway. Decatur County has about 11,000 people.
@billprady I'll let the city people worry about all that. They're the ones who read all that science fiction stuff. All I'm saying is if you could spend Thanksgiving in McAllen. TX or Boston, MA seems to me McAllen, TX wold win.
@billprady If they are headed to the northeast they are gonna wish they were still on the border.
@JoshMankiewicz Choose that weekend for a Dateline marathon! Also, that would be a good weekend to move the clocks back. Just a thought!
@mmpadellan @laweez I wish we could have a president from the South.
@JudgeDillard @samford_sports @DevlinHodges10 @NCAA_FCS @SamfordFootball @ETSUFootball @SamfordVB @SoConSports @SamfordMBB The East Tennessee win was huge! Pray for UAB!

@M_warren99 Congratulations to you!
@jason_howerton @KurtSchlichter @DanCrenshawTX These Yank**s toes need to be stepped on!
@grizzlemeister @RodStryker It is these cable editorial networks that divide our country. These statements do nothing to encourage and uplift anyone.
@Jpm5164 @pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump I would be for that! They need the gospel, too!
@CCUChanticleers Happy Thanksgiving to all!
@Cheweeb @PascoSheriff The level home of Dixie 105!
@JacqueLarose @JackKingston Amen, I'm ready to see something else on television. We sure did not talk about Casey Anthony and Amanda Knox enough did we?
@robertgauldin @pastortimbutler Amen, praise the Lord for the youth who are eager and willing to get the gospel out to a lost and fallen world.
@TilleyTracie @bbctuscaloosa Amen, I wish the mainstream media would pick up on that. Maybe we can somehow get the gospel to them and show them that ultimately it doesn't matter who the president is God is in control.
@drmgodwin @paynelindsey @TenderfootTV @upandvanished I saw the Dateline episode and when I had this was going to be on Oxygen I just had to tune in. I was supposed to go to an engagement, but it got canceled at the last minute.
@drmgodwin @macmunch1 @paynelindsey Wow, thanks I'll definitely check it out and give it a relisten.
@PhilHollowayEsq @upandvanished With this being such a small county and everybody knowing everybody will the judge have to pick a jury from another county?
96% through "Poppet": https://t.co/hbO07H1MSU
@DavidPaul1191 @AG_Conservative @steph93065 @GOP Yes, the cable editorial networks blab on with their own agenda. The majority of us don't care about their views. We want news that is not analyzed to the enth degree.
@KassyDillon @benshapiro See it's Thanksgiving week and the people on the cable editorial networks are speculating on why people voted for someone. Was this news? Did it encourage anybody? This is why our country is so divided.
@BrendanReichs @TheCatFather73 And she has never gotten involved in politics.
@angelgirl1976 @wesderby Yes, Krystal is largely in the South. In fact, they started in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
Will the jury for Ryan Duke and Bo Dukes likely have to come from outside Irwin County?
@LauraHarrisNBC5 @ChrisCBlake Yes, I love to easedrop on people's conversations. Maybe you might be sitting next to a person who might be on a future episode of Dateline.
@Tuff_Dog @48hours Yes, you're right when you bring up the point about young people not watching the local news.
