2/ Previous RIN stock estimates indicated the potential for more than 1.8 billion in available carryover coming into the 2017 compliance year. The estimated deficits for 2017 and 2018 would fully exhaust that level of RIN stocks.

3/ The effects of the heat may have been even greater farther south. Rainfall was higher across southern New South Wales, but multiple periods of very hot weather increased stress on irrigated crops.
2/ In southern #Queensland and northern New South Wales, the repeated heat and persistent dryness reduced yield prospects for dryland #crops, while the extremely hot conditions may have negatively impacted some irrigated crops as well.

4/ @USDA Wx: #Corn Belt-- Although a protective #snow cover blankets much of the #Midwest, some soft red winter #wheat fields have been exposed to sub-zero temperatures, leading to #soil heaving and an increased risk of winterkill.
3/ @USDA Wx: #Corn Belt-- #Livestock remain severely stressed by the harsh weather, although winds have diminished.
2/ @USDA Wx: #Corn Belt-- A final day of record-breaking cold is underway. This morning’s temperatures plunged below 0°F in all of the #Midwest except the southernmost Corn Belt, with readings below -30°F common across the upper Midwest.
1/ @USDA Wx: Plains-- Frigid weather lingers across the Dakotas and eastern sections of #Nebraska and #Kansas. In contrast, temperatures are rebounding to near- or above-normal levels across the High Plains.

2/ The linking together of U.S. #trade and fiscal deficits is a reoccurring storyline since 1980.  However, a review of the often-called twin deficits reveals that, while they can move together, the cumulative evidence is of no year-by-year statistical relationship

4/ The discount on E85 relative to E10 did increase markedly for the 10-month period between Aug '17 &amp; May '18, but the timing of the increased discounts did not line up perfectly w the surge in E85 use ➡️ suggests no single factor is responsible for the recent surge in E85 usage https://t.co/ixrizG4bR0
3/ One factor that may have offset the disincentive of crashing D6 prices is increased access to E85 pumps associated with the @USDA’s Blender Infrastructure Program.  However, both the number of E85 pumps and the volume per E85 pump has increased notably since 2016 https://t.co/gmotnV6xRB
2/ E85 use in the U.S. has increased nicely in the last year.  This is puzzling since the price of D6 #ethanol RINs crashed during the same time period, and D6 RINs are supposed to incentivize the consumption of higher ethanol blends https://t.co/2nUdK3PAWL https://t.co/6CiXPFbB0c

6/ It is important to recognize that the public data on #E85 use in the U.S. is incomplete and this should be considered when viewing the results presented in this article https://t.co/u2KBuwT24J
5/ All three series show double-digit increases in E85 use during the Dec '17 - Oct '18 period.  It appears that something other than RIN prices has been driving #E85 use in recent months, &amp; that something else appears to be growth in the number of gas stations offering E85 pumps
4/ Surprisingly, each of the three series available in the public domain on #E85 use show a consistent upward trend since December 2017, just the opposite of that predicted by the SRE-driven crash in D6 RIN prices https://t.co/u2KBuxaDtj
3/ We examine the available data on #E85 use in this article in order to see if trends in usage are consistent with this expectation https://t.co/u2KBuxaDtj

5/ For the year, the @USDA projected feed and residual use of corn at 5.5 billion bushels.  If the USDA projection is correct, feed and residual use in the first quarter should be near 2.33 billion bushels https://t.co/955c6xMBok https://t.co/sxJpoQx1Jz
4/ Since 1997, the change in the #soybean yield forecast from August to September declined in seven of those years.  The subsequent soybean yield in January dropped in four of those years with an average reduction of 0.27 bushels per acre https://t.co/955c6xMBok https://t.co/KVnGEMmwIf
3/ Using data since 1997, the change in the #corn yield forecast from October to November declined in five of those years.  The subsequent corn yield in January declined in all five of those years with an average reduction of 1.7 bushels per acre https://t.co/955c6xMBok https://t.co/H2yJVr3IbI
2/ The ongoing partial government #shutdown halted the release of many key @USDA reports.  If the USDA releases the reports as scheduled on January 11, they hold implications for forming expectations on #corn and #soybean prices in 2019 https://t.co/955c6xMBok

Over '04-14 'period, cropland appreciation-- reflecting the relatively steep rise in #grain &amp; oilseed #commodity prices--  led to greater appreciation where these crops are grown (including the Northern Plains, Lake States, and #Corn Belt)  https://t.co/n3e10b7lA4 @USDA_ERS https://t.co/HOobjIVC8E
Over the last two decades, farm real estate values appreciated differently by land use &amp; region.

7/ Putting all those pieces together, this map gives you a rough sense of all the ways U.S. land is used. https://t.co/EbfWag15Yg
6/ There’s a single, major occupant on all this land: #cows. Between pastures and cropland used to produce feed, 41 percent of U.S. land in the contiguous states revolves around #livestock. https://t.co/4aG2cixF0d
5/ Yet the actual land area used to grow the food Americans eat is much smaller—only about the size of #Indiana, #Illinois and half of #Iowa combined. https://t.co/Haz6LQKYdD
4/ #Agricultural land takes up about a fifth of the country. https://t.co/xvILBzbh6o
