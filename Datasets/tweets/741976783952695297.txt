Basically, if you hate Kirsten Gillibrand because she called for Al Franken to resign, you’re no different than ❌❌❌MAGADEPLORABLE🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸, and you’re just as much of a piece of shit.
But standing up to Al Franken is an objectively Good thing she’s done in her career.

@matthew_p_roy The elections were held under ranked choice voting. People ranked their choices in those elections. If RCV is ruled unconstitutional, the entire election is thrown out because it allowed people to rank their choices in those elections.
@matthew_p_roy If Poliquin’s lawsuit is successful in ruling RCV unconstitutional, the entire election for Congress (in both districts and Senate) is thrown out. So Maine’s two House seats and Class I Senate seat would be vacant, requiring special elections.
Bruce Poliquin, who cares so much about fiscal responsibility, wants us to run costly special elections for Senate and our two House districts. Because if his lawsuit is successful, the results of ME2, ME1 and the Senate race are all thrown out. #mepolitics

@daphnehowland @StubbyMalone @ASFried @aobrien2010 @lockman4mehouse I for one would love it if Eric Brakey kept running for office. Can he be the GOP nominee against Governor Mills in 2022? #MePolitics
And if you’re wondering, that person was Ken Curtis, who won with 53% of the vote over incumbent governor John Reed in 1966. Curtis and Reed were the only candidates on the ballot, so one of them had to win with 50% of the vote. Makes what Mills accomplished even more impressive.
According to the @PressHerald, Janet Mills now at 51% of the vote. If this holds, she will become the first gubernatorial candidate to win an outright majority since @SenAngusKing in 1998, and the first to win a majority as a non-incumbent in over 50 years. #MEPolitics

@commonguy123 @JZBleiberg @kcjohnson9 @FiveThirtyEight You have no idea what you’re talking about. He never gave Hillary a 90% chance to win the election. In fact, after the GOP convention he gave Trump a 51-49 chance, before moving it back towards Hillary after the Dem convention.
@commonguy123 @JZBleiberg @kcjohnson9 @FiveThirtyEight Jesus Christ, he gave Trump a 30% chance of winning the day before the election. No other forecasting service gave Trump greater than a 20% chance, and many gave him a 0% chance. You’re clearly the one in the bubble, because you have no idea what you’re talking about.
@commonguy123 @JZBleiberg @kcjohnson9 @FiveThirtyEight Yeah, but he was still right. And no, there weren’t “plenty” of forecasters who gave Trump a decent chance. There was one. 538.
It’s important to note that the @FiveThirtyEight model takes into account fundraising numbers and voting history. Mills has been blowing Moody away with fundraising and the state does have a D lean. #mepolitics https://t.co/QjVw9kAtgW

@LeeJacksonME I mean, I will admit I am trolling you a bit, and I understand part of your job is to spin for Poliquin. But spare me. Every actual socialist I know in the second district supported St. Clair or Fulford in the primary. Most have major problems with Golden's record and platform.
@LeeJacksonME Words have meaning, Lee. Jared is not even remotely a socialist, unless you twist that word to mean "supporter of a universal healthcare plan," which throws a whole bunch of the right-wing's favorite people under the "socialist" umbrella. Including Thatcher.
@LeeJacksonME I mean, if supporting a universal healthcare program makes you a socialist, I guess Margaret Thatcher is a socialist.		https://t.co/xjxg8t2m2r
@LeeJacksonME Hunny, just like Obama, Jared ain't no socialist. Has he even talked about seizing the means of production? Has he talked about a maximum wage? Has he talked about abolishing ICE and opening borders? Because if not, he's nowhere near even a moderate member in the DSA.
@LeeJacksonME Golden was up by 1 after the first day of the first poll (Sep. 12), Poliquin took the lead early on Day 2 (Sep. 13) and held that lead for the rest of the poll.  In the third day, Poliquin's lead actually went down by a few points.		https://t.co/LIumIksiOC
@LeeJacksonME 41% is PATHETIC for a TWO-TERM INCUMBENT with boatloads of cash. I guess running a smear campaign against a military veteran who has fought terrorism isn't good politics. Too bad it's all Poliquin has. https://t.co/LIumIksiOC #mepolitics

@magnameter @DirigoBlue Also I’m an irony-poster and big into Weird Twitter, everything I say is basically wrapped in 14 levels of sarcasm
@magnameter @DirigoBlue It’s okay. I’m a liberal arts guy who has no relatives in the military or working at BIW, so obviously I’m not the most learned abou BIW
@DirigoBlue @magnameter That would be wonderful. I’m sure environmentalist Chellie Pingree would love that too.
@magnameter @DirigoBlue So I said subs instead of ships. That’s who cares. Please engage in debate honestly.
@magnameter @marcmalon2 @mgrohman Allen you constantly move the goalposts, because your candidate is completely unqualified, wholly dishonest and a hypocrite. Reminder: We were discussing his potential power in Congress (he wouldn’t have any). Grohman ignores Chellie’s work on the appropriations committee for BIW
@magnameter @DirigoBlue Which begs the obvious question: who cares
@DirigoBlue Regardless
@magnameter @marcmalon2 @mgrohman DUDE’S ALREADY SAYING HE’S A YES VOTE ON THIS STUFF. So he has no bargaining power to make it better. All they have to do is give BIW something in Marty will blindly vote for it. That’s literally what he’s saying.

@magnameter @PingreeForME And betray the Republicans that would’ve gotten him to Congress? Not. A. Chance. That’s a one-way ticket to a single term.		I don’t even know why I’m debating this with you, Grohman will finish behind Holbrook and Pingree will get 60% of the vote like always.
@magnameter @mgrohman Today. When he lied about Pingree’s record on BIW and shows he has no idea what the NDAA is.
@magnameter @PingreeForME So who she’s gonna be replaced with on appropriations? One of the rookie Dems getting elected this term, who don’t know anything about congress?		And you’re ignoring the larger point that Grohman WILL NOT BE ON ANY COMMITTEES AT ALL, and therefore Mainers’ voices won’t be heard.
@magnameter @PingreeForME I mean, I get being cynical and stuff, but I highly HIGHLY doubt she won’t be on appropriations in the next Congress.		And no matter which committee she’ll be on, at least she will be on one, instead of Marty, who I guess...just wouldn’t do that crucial part of the job he wants?
Word of the day is "momentum." @MoveOn has endorsed @golden4congress. He will be moving on to Congress. #mepolitics 		https://t.co/DOMUlq70KE
@DirigoBlue I did do that! It’s why all my subsequent tweets appear as replies to the first one. It all appears on the #mepolitics feed though because I tagged them all with that hashtag.
5/5 I don’t know why Marty thinks this is a good way to run, or if it’s coming from him directly or from misguided advisers. But it needs to stop. Mainers deserve an honest campaign. #mepolitics
4/5 This is just the latest in a string of dishonest and disingenuous statements Grohman has made throughout this campaign, either misconstruing Pingree’s record, inflating his own, and whitewashing the records of his far-right supporters like LePage and Volk. #mepolitics
3/5 Grohman has said he’d refuse to caucus with either party, meaning he wouldn’t be nearly as effective at getting BIW and PNS work, because he wouldn’t be on a relevant committee (or ANY committee). #mepolitics
2/5 Chellie Pingree singlehandedly gets BIW and PNS work through her tireless efforts on the appropriations committee. This work is often unsung and taken for granted because she’s so damn good at it #mepolitics

@aknight__47 Smith totally would’ve beaten Holbrook if he ran again.
@aknight__47 *Grohman, not Gorham. Damn autocorrect
@aknight__47 The real question is whether Gorham passes Holbrook. The (limited, Grohman-funded) polling we’ve seen for this seat indicated Marty getting like 8% of the vote.
@aknight__47 I don’t think Chellie’s percentage of the vote will decrease from the 60% she got in 2016 (and in fact, with a turnout surge from Democrats, it could increase), mostly because Marty isn’t running a campaign that appeals to Democrats at all (unlike Hayes, for example).

@AERatterree She was clearly intimiately involved with the campaign if she was named chair of the campaign in Maine.
@KageInTraining @Moody4Gov Attorney General Mills has provided most of the narcan given to law enforcement by buying it herself, because LePage wouldn’t do it.
@magnameter @mainepeople @mgrohman @MaineDems Not one of those people is committed to making government better or bridging divides — they made their careers on the total opposite of that. THAT is what makes him a hypocrite. Getting support from these people shows that he doesn’t care about the thing he focuses on most.
@magnameter @mainepeople @mgrohman @MaineDems 1st: LOL at the notion the MPA is a “far-left” organization. 2nd: His “conscience” is apparently good enough for an open white supremacist (Amy Volk), a notorious homophobe (Paul LePage) and a fascist (the Trump lady). If it wasn’t, they wouldn’t be supporting him.
5/ Long story short, I'm gonna oppose Grohman for every single office he will ever run for, from now until forever. An absolute hypocrite, beyond even the normal level for a politician. #mepolitics
4/ It'd be absolutely hilarious if, even with the support of basically the entire Maine Republican Party, Grohman still finishes third. My cup would runneth over with schadenfreude. #mepolitics
3/ I'd actually like Grohman more if he wore a MAGA hat to rallies and chanted "lock her up!!" It'd be more honest. But instead he's trying to pull the wool over Mainers' eyes with this whole fake moderate persona. #mepolitics
2/ I mean, Grohman has ACTUAL TRUMP STAFFERS backing his campaign. He has the support of the godfather of Maine's far-right, Paul LePage. He is a dangerous candidate who will move Trump's agenda forward. Why else would these people back him? #mepolitics
1/ I know I've been complaining about Grohman a lot over the past several days, but the man is literally endorsed by Donald Trump's Maine campaign chair. How can anyone think he actually cares about "fixing Washington" when he's proud of support from Trumpists?  #mepolitics

@DirigoBlue @mikeshepherdME Hear, hear. Right now our legislature is filled with people who can afford to take six months off. There are a lot of great people in both parties at the grassroots level who would make good legislators who simply can’t afford to become legislators. #mepolitics
@RuPaulLePage @uniteamerica Nope. I was easily the youngest person in the room by at least a decade.
This reminds me: one of my pet issues is increasing democratization in the state. I think Treasurer, AG and Secretary of State should all be elected by the people, like in California and New York. These people do important jobs, but many (like Hayes) are anonymous #mepolitics https://t.co/N0Q7caH4eU
I met and spoke with Hayes. I found her to be polite and knowledgeable, but as a committed socialist I could never cast my ballot for her. This was before I learned of her history of union-busting. #mepolitics
I am also in the Hayes ad at 20 seconds -- I'm the dude on the left in the red baseball cap. That event, for the Centrist Project (now @uniteamerica), was held at USM. As a USM Student Senator and a politics junkie, I showed up (there was also free food). #mepolitics
More outsiders at approximately 20 seconds in the Hayes ad: State Reps Owen Casas and Kent Ackley are seated next to Hayes. #mepolitics
Also: shoutout to "outsider" former State Rep Andrea Boland, presented as an average, everyday Mainer in Hayes's ad. Kyle Bailey is also present in the ad, further cementing the "outsider" image :eyeroll: #mepolitics
Terry Hayes's new ad is titled "A Unifying Outsider." I'm not sure "outsider" is how I'd describe the incumbent State Treasurer who previously served eight years in the State House, the final term as the assistant majority leader. #mepolitics https://t.co/CMWdCiJyPZ

I believe the last time white shorts were not United's primary color was 1901...before United even adopted their red jerseys.
Confirmed now that we see the whole kit: @ManUtd's primary shorts are indeed BLACK. Traditionally, United's shorts are white, with black alternate shorts only going with the red primary jersey when their opponents also wear white shorts. @UniWatch @PhilHecken https://t.co/TaluEvA2lv

@TheMadTweeter4 @grittyspur @mom4volks @Ocasio2018 You keep trying to change the subject, because you know a meager increase in taxes is not prohibitive for 99.9% of businesses, and if that increase is prohibitive, that business is in bad shape in the first place and many other things are equally if not more likely to harm it.
@TheMadTweeter4 @grittyspur @mom4volks @Ocasio2018 As I've been saying, there are many other "straws" that would "break the camel's back," like a reduction in customers or a repair cost.		I'm not sure Warren will run, but I wouldn't be surprised if she did. Booker almost certainly will, but progressives don't like him.

@TheMadTweeter4 @grittyspur @mom4volks @Ocasio2018 BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS SPECIFIC TAX INCREASE, NOT ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY OF RUNNING A BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IN MAINE		Bernie's a bit too old, tho I can't think of any potential candidates I'd like more than he. I guess I like Chris Murphy in CT well enough. Merkley in OR too.
@TheMadTweeter4 @grittyspur @mom4volks We are talking, specifically, about this referendum question and the impact of this referendum question alone. I mean, you could similarly ask "what if Bernie gets elected in 2020 and increases taxes to 90%!?!?!"
@grittyspur @TheMadTweeter4 @mom4volks Nice strawman you built there. I never said it was easy to run a small business, I said if a 1.9% tax increase will end someone's small business, then they were on thin ice anyway. An increase in rent, or a repair, or a slight decrease in customers would also end their business.

@TheMadTweeter4 @mom4volks Your entire premise is based on a belief that poor people will want this and vote for this, and rich people will not.
@TheMadTweeter4 @mom4volks Also this would violate the right to a secret ballot.
@TheMadTweeter4 @mom4volks So you'd want to tax poorer people more than the rich, is what you're saying.
@TheMadTweeter4 @mom4volks Maine has a balanced budget amendment, any increase in spending must be matched with an increase in revenue. So what do we cut? Education? State Troopers? Fish and Game Wardens? Prison guards?
So weird that the usual Bruce Poliquin stans in the #mepolitics-sphere have been nowhere to be seen after this amazing foot-in-mouth moment from the campaign.		Don't worry, though. Continuing to post selfies will definitely make this go away. https://t.co/aHVNq2IqJQ
@TheMadTweeter4 @mom4volks I don't think a 1.9% increase will "choke" small businesses, and if it will, they probably aren't great businesspeople. But the fact of the matter remains, people in Maine are suffering and the government has a moral obligation to alleviate it.
@TheMadTweeter4 @mom4volks They won't. Why do conservatives always think that people live here as like a tax haven? Lots of rich people live here because they like it. I guarantee Stephen King and the Bean family ain't moving.

And it’s all Anthony Kennedy’s fault. Literally everything that happens when Trump nominates the ghost of George Rockwell will be his fault. Every decision he’s ever taken now comes with that qualifier. He’s ruined his own reputation for generations to come.
Regardless, you can kiss goodbye to any sort of progress for the rest of our lives. The court will bend over backwards to find universal healthcare unconstitutional, to find strikes unconstitutional, to find affirmative action unconstitutional.
Also: Anthony Kennedy is a fascist fuck. A lot of ink is going to be spilled on how great he was to LGBTQ folks, but let’s not forget his repeated assaults on the working class.
If the next Democratic President doesn’t literally pack the courts, I will riot.
One last thought before I go to bed: Maloney must be quaking in her boots. She couldn’t break 60% against a guy whose primary method of campaigning was catfishing people on Tinder. A real challenger would’ve taken her down tonight, and a real challenger will step up in 2020.

2/3 she talked about her abusive ex while Eves will undoubtedly get the vast majority of 2nd preferences from Sweet voters. Cote voters probably won’t rank Mills all that highly and vice-versa. #mepolitics

@aknight__47 Try to run on Poliquin in the second district, maybe? Defend the narrow State Senate majority? Other than that your options are pretty limited, especially if Moody goes back on something like abortion. Then you could probably kiss the Blaine House, State Senate and Poliquin bye.
@aknight__47 You and I both know he will. The problem (for us) is that there’s no other right-wing option, while Hayes is running left-of-center and Caron is running pure center. So who else would Republicans vote for?

@AdamPaulHayes @WatcherPol I agree with you. If it truly is Mills, Cote and Sweet, the former two laying into each other for about a month has to help the latter, as does the quasi-endorsement of Eves.
@AdamPaulHayes @WatcherPol Personally, I feel like Mills is a largely manufactured front runner. “She’s the Attorney General, so she must be the front runner.” “She has Emily’s list so so she must be the front runner.” I’m seeing no grassroots support for her, and much more for Sweet and Cote. #MEpolitics

@aknight__47 Regardless, three weeks ago I was pretty sure the race would be Moody v Eves, now I’m pretty sure it could be anyone v anyone. These next 12 days are going to be super fun.
@aknight__47 Yeah, I was surprised at how many of my Republican friends were willing to  throw in with Moody after he joined the party like the day before he announced. I know Dems who loved everything about Bernie, but wouldn’t support him in 2016 because he wasn’t a member of the party.
@aknight__47 I expected that, honestly, because Mary has had a visible imprint on the LePage Administration and his legacy. Moody is literally just some guy.

@DirigoBlue Not sure it’s a great strategy for her to be honest. Primary electorates are very often made up of the most partisan voters. Not sure how much traction she’ll get with them.

1/ Incredibly disappointed with the Telegram’s framing of the Democratic race in today’s paper. Classifying Mills as the frontruner, hamfistedly trying to fit each candidate into “progressive” or “moderate” boxes, dismissing of any candidate not named Mills or Cote. #mepolitics
@RuPaulLePage Totally agree. Article also reinforces the artificial “Mills-vs-Cote” narrative that isn’t true on the ground from my perspective at all.
Maybe they did, actually, and there were no takers. Still. Absolutely stunning.
Man. This is perhaps the most shocking move since the Nomar trade. This came out of nowhere. Surprised they didn't try to move him for a C-level prospect.
Maybe it's a good thing that the Red Sox off the field won't be as entertaining. But the dude has a decent OBP.
And of course I love Mookie and Beni and X and Devers and Pedey and Sale and Kimbrel, but none of those guys really have an out of this world, team-leading personality.
And why are we letting him go but keeping BLAKE SWIHART. I understand contract considerations and the like but Swihart has ACTUALLY REQUESTED A TRADE. I'd keep Hanley over Swihart ten times out of ten. Literally the only player on this team with any personality.
All day, I was either shooting with @Sweet4Governor or manning the ticker lines for @UniWatch so I wasn't paying attention to anything and this Hanley stuff came out of nowehere for me. #redsox

@JTrea81 Maine constitution only applies for Maine races, not federal races that take place in Maine. There’s nothing in the US Constitution requiring pluralities, only that Representatives to the House and Senate be elected by the people of the state.
@JTrea81 RCV’s implemented for the Senate and House races (assuming it passes again in June). Or is it not?
@snappity @ASFried Biggest reason I’m for Golden.
@emahone199 @CoteForMaine Progressives know Mills is incredibly weak on this issue. Betsy Sweet, Mark Dion and Adam Cote all brought it up in their convention speeches. I wish my second choice Mark Eves has as well. #MEPolitics

@aknight__47 I too would like to see your candidate win your primary, again not for the same reasons as you 😉
@aknight__47 I’m friends with a Moody supporter so he had me under the impression the dude was just running away with it, so I was surprised to see larger delegations for both Mary and Garrett at the convention.
@aknight__47 3/2 Basically, our primary is wide open. I believe Betsy, Eves, Cote and Mills all have a chance to win. Yours is too, though I believe Moody is more heavily favored than anyone on our side (but I live in Cumberland, his base, so that might not be true in the rest of the state).
@aknight__47 2/2 You can accuse me of bias in favor of my candidate, but to me it’s entirely reasonable for Betsy to claim the mantle as one of the front runners. Golden also has the most endorsements and is blowing St. Clair out of the water with labor support so I also believe he’s favored.
@aknight__47 1/2 You bring up a good point, but there’s been one poll of the gov and CD2 primary so far, only done by an outfit not known for its accuracy and with a poor sampling process. According to financial reports, Sweet has raised the second most amount of money behind only Cote.
@aknight__47 It's a strawpoll of Maine Young Democrats, specifically to see who members of the Maine Young Democrats are supporting. Not who everyone is supporting.

I really, really hope you put Betsy first. She’s one of the most genuine people I know, and is so prepared to tackle the issues our state faces.
@BruceBourgoine @BetsySweetMaine @CoteForMaine Betsy is one of the nicest most genuine human beings I’ve ever met. I don’t know Adam personally, but he seems great too. I’m with Betsy because her platform is pragmatic and progressive, and she walks the walk with getting money out of politics by running as clean candidate.

@MEVD Franken had to go because this is the Democratic Party. We stand up for the marginalized in society. We stand up for women. We stand up for victims. Having someone like Franken as one of the Democratic Party’s highest officers undercut that mission.

@MEVD As someone who’s actually been groped (yes, it happens to guys too!) let me assure you, ma’am, that you absolutely do not.

Audible gasps when Duson reveals that she is not meeting with Strimling. #RumbleInPortland #mepolitics

Duson was one of Strimling's biggest supporters in 2015 election #mepolitics
Duson: "I have restrained myself from responding, but I won't let it go a second time." #RumbleInPortland #mepolitics
Duson: "I need to express my own annoyance with a personal Facebook post and tweet." #RumbleInPortland #mepolitics
You get the feeling that Strimling has very few friends in the room. #mepolitics

Batson to Strimling: "I have certain expectations of the mayors role." Implies that Strimling is neglecting his duties #mepolitics

Costa: "Ultimately this is about collaboration" #RumbleInPortland #mepolitics
