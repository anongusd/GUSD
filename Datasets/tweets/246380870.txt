@brotherbeat @QueenInYeIIow @TheWayWithAnoa Yeah it doesn't really give prescriptions, it seems his intent was to educate people of the untold history to compel others to right the wrongs. I'm with you on that kind of mass movement my dude.
@TheWayWithAnoa @brotherbeat @QueenInYeIIow Soft-blocking isn't really good faith either, just block me, it takes less effort.
@brotherbeat @QueenInYeIIow @TheWayWithAnoa The Color of Law doesn't call for reparations, it calls for a New Civil Rights movement.
@QueenInYeIIow @TheWayWithAnoa @brotherbeat Damn I guess a vouch for you earns me a softblock.
@QueenInYeIIow @TheWayWithAnoa @brotherbeat I think she just softblocked me?

@TheWayWithAnoa @brotherbeat @QueenInYeIIow Done then. I don't know the other dude, but I'd vouch for QIY to be in good faith.
@brotherbeat @QueenInYeIIow @TheWayWithAnoa Got to check 'Color of Law' to show that in the past the New Deal policies of FDR were inherently racist. Reparations doesn't fix racism obviously. I am for reparations and socialist New New Deal policies that address the institutional racism of the past.

@QueenInYeIIow @TheWayWithAnoa QIY I didn't intend that as a rebuke. My meaning was: it was government policy that kept black people out of programs that built a white middle class, so I think it's apt that government pay reparations. Therefore I support it.

@cat_the_cat__ @Totally_Legit_T @Naidycakes_ @Judith_Char @mrfparadis @TamatiLaur @tornadosis06 You're such a hack. It's amazing. From Peterson's own mouth. His audience is male dominated.		https://t.co/jnGV740JjQ
@Totally_Legit_T @cat_the_cat__ @Naidycakes_ I hate to be the one to tell you, Jordan Peterson's target audience are incels. Vastly a male based readership. Except for Ms. "Literature is transcendent" shallot.
@SpaKendrick @CreatorChaos @HailCaesar_ @TheWayWithAnoa @ChelseaClinton She is an unconscious racist. When you say "as an American" in response to a tweet suggesting Ilhan isn't because she wasn't born here, that's racism. And you and Chelsea can't even see it. Do better.

@DreamsUnderfoot @anjalienjeti She said "as an American" in response to Ilhan Omar accurately pointing out AIPAC's influence over our politics. The implication is that Ilhan isn't an American. Also Clinton was responding to a white supremacist adjacent account, Ashley Goldberg.
@TheWayWithAnoa Fuck those people. That comment was racist as fuck and Chelsea doesn't have the self awareness to even identify it. Too many white liberals that harbor unconscious racism and think they are woke because they didn't vote for Trump.

@AnitaM86 @butchcjg @_waleedshahid Well I'd rather be the guy that didn't endorse the fucking racist but that's just my opinion. You have yours ma'am.
@AnitaM86 @_waleedshahid The point is it didn't age well. No one is blaming Neera for Ralph's racism. That's absurd. Don't be obtuse.

@raising_hill @nberlat @magi_jay Yes I base all my views on personal experience too.
@raising_hill @nberlat @magi_jay It's not that long of an article. I screen capped like 40% of the whole piece. Saying that's cherry picked is not being real. You should have read the whole thing.  But I do appreciate you being real about what we disagree on.
@raising_hill @nberlat @magi_jay So you are pro prosecuting parents like I already said. If you're being real you'd admit it and move on. We disagree about this issue.
@raising_hill @nberlat @magi_jay https://t.co/nyiRj7cmrl
@raising_hill @nberlat @magi_jay Yes arresting homeless and impoverished people (the majority of truancy children) is both noble and humane. I'm glad the DA thinks this is successful. https://t.co/WoWAjSyJBG
@raising_hill @nberlat @magi_jay Ma'am you're just not being real.
@raising_hill @nberlat @magi_jay You're pro using the justice system to prosecute parents for their kid's truancy. We disagree. Have a good one.
@raising_hill @nberlat @magi_jay So you believe the justice system is fair and noble? This where we differ.  Hence why I think is a bad idea to create legal pathways to prosecute parents and you don't. If new Jim crow wasn't a reality, I might agree with you and Harris. Might.
@raising_hill @nberlat @magi_jay If these parents POC and impoverished, do you think they'll get fair representation in the justice system? Do you believe new Jim crow is a real thing?
@raising_hill @nberlat @magi_jay What happens to the children when they see their parents put in jail? Is that better for their psychological well being or worse?
@raising_hill @nberlat @magi_jay So you're pro prosecuting parents over truancy. Got it.
@raising_hill @nberlat @magi_jay If you fundamentally believe there is institutional racism in our justice (real) then you should be against creating ways to put parents in jail for their kids truancy. This seems really simple imo.

@IfICouldScream @LadyInWaiting25 @VR0NLINE Maybe you trust the justice system to be noble and just. I see it in the context of New Jim Crow. I don't think we need to make legal pathways to send parents, even flawed negligent ones, to jail. Maybe we fundamentally disagree about the nature justice system though.
@IfICouldScream @LadyInWaiting25 @VR0NLINE @AngryBlackLady The best solution is for families to be able to provide for their children. Given the myriad of problems human beings face trying to make in this fucked up world, incarceration seems like a immoral and inhumane approach to truancy to people like me.

@IfICouldScream @LadyInWaiting25 @VR0NLINE Glad to hear you admit that locking families up isn't a solution that will help the family!!!
@IfICouldScream @LadyInWaiting25 @VR0NLINE I'll reply again, lock the parents up. Really sounds like it would be doing the family a favor. If your kid wants to rebel, they need to see there are consequences. Jail time for sure!
@IfICouldScream @AngryBlackLady @LadyInWaiting25 @VR0NLINE Lock them up! Throw away the key! That will teach those pesky rebellious teenagers.
@IfICouldScream @AngryBlackLady @LadyInWaiting25 @VR0NLINE It's easy to pay your bills from jail. Good for the mental health of children to see their parents go to jail too.
@IfICouldScream @AngryBlackLady @LadyInWaiting25 @VR0NLINE Lock those parents up seems like compassionate solution if I ever heard one.
@marthaj44 @AynaE2 @pjstorms @VR0NLINE @AngryBlackLady Lock them up!

@nectarina12 @Disgrazia4 Some Clinton supporters are toxic as well. However I'm still going to vote for the candidate with the best policy positions. If that person doesn't win the primary, I'm voting for whoever isn't Trump. I'm glad Kamala Harris has adopted some of Bernie's positions.
@ben_mishiev @QueenInYeIIow @lcmoser @Wallzers @lcmoser This time it's different? America has changed it's ways from the history you claim to be aware of? Donald Trump, Mike Pence, and Elliot Abrams are just interested in restoring democracy in Venezuela?
