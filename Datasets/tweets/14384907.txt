I got elected at 34, &amp; had to borrow from my folks for security deposit &amp; student loans. Even with my bougie background, the year of campaigning required spending down all my savings. For a lot of state leg candidates, they don‚Äôt even get a real salary after. #BarriersTooHigh https://t.co/wrQBLANnst
I argued, based on my time in the House, that a Dem-majority with more working (&amp; true middle) class Reps would have prioritized foreclosures over TARP and extended tax cuts for &lt;$250k pre-2010 election instead of making Bush cuts permanent afterwards. https://t.co/46FnJFO5pj
The lack of working class backgrounds for Members of Congress absolutely skews the policy agenda. I reviewed a book on this by @Nick_Carnes_  for @DemJournal https://t.co/46FnJFO5pj https://t.co/7KweT7Srt5

Yes Dem gains match 2006, but on a much more gerrymandered map. 		True magnitude of 2018 Wave measured in ‚Äúgerrymander-adjusted‚Äù terms just as real box office rankings adjust for inflation 	(i.e. why Star Wars &amp; Sound of Music belong in Top5 instead of Jurassic World &amp; Titanic). https://t.co/dvMCk7r5xw
Just in case Trump thought progressives had used up all of our love of country, Constitution and corruption investigators on Tuesday piling up historic wins against hate at every level of government, he might want to glance out his gold-rimmed tower windows... https://t.co/CvSCP5e49b
This is an awesome comeback for the win column! Rep-Elect Kim is an awesome person and great addition to the new people‚Äôs majority https://t.co/ZhyzepaOQe
WALK &amp; CHEW GUM - the new majority has a moral obligation to hold Trump accountable and can do so while also advancing bold reforms for healthcare, corruption and criminal justice that just proved majority support even on red state ballots.
The importance of protecting the Mueller investigation is NOT measured by how it plays politically. This is a fundamental test of the rule of law and stand against corrupting the DOJ into a partisan weapon. https://t.co/4O9RriYEEy

Thank you @LeslieCockburn for an incredible campaign that revived hope and grassroots energy across VA05. Your overperformance forced the GOP to spend millions that could have gone to protect seats Dems did flip. You &amp; your team are a big part of VA‚Äôs wins last night and beyond! https://t.co/6XzTSNiGBp
Wow! Trump truly sounds like a guy who knows his con is up. He knows the crimes he committed and how many of them are known to witnesses who have already flipped. He never gave a rip about GOP holds - only about shutting down the criminal investigations closing in around him.
If you doubt that Trump got crushed last night, watch him at this press conference! His #1 goal was avoiding investigations and accountability from a Dem-led House. #Lawyered
So many amazing stories that won‚Äôt make page 1 today but will transform lives and reform our criminal justice system, including this Commonwealth Attorney race in Chesterfield outside Richmond üëáüèºüëáüèº https://t.co/71wX1ZBFzJ

Painful difference between NeverTrump Republican pundits who are spinning this as a major Dem victory vs Dem pundits who seem genetically pre-determined to treat this as a defeat. https://t.co/oirmKzgBIb
Big picture - Dems &amp; progressives won an existential victory last night that keeps us in a position to win the larger, longer war for the soul and future of our country.

It‚Äôs a (w)rap, @DelgadoforNY19 will defeat hate and represent in Congress!
Good triumphs over hate! Even on a rigged district map! Dems win the House! Every person - mostly women - who stepped up to run, work, or volunteer owns this historic restoration of sanity, pluralism and the rule of law!
In the real world, this is a huge night for Dems and yuge rejection of Trumpism so far. Dems are winning Gov seats across America‚Äôs heartland (even Kansas!), flipping 3 seats in VA, and have a 90% chance to win the House majority on an utterly rigged map. https://t.co/hLnc98fmu5

@brianandmari Kaine romps to victory? VA-GOP won‚Äôt win statewide for over a decade. Dems poised to pick up 1-3 seats on a map utterly rigged by GOP? Stay tuned.
Policy doesn‚Äôt win elections but policy results win re-Election (see auto-bailout -&gt; Obama16). 	Bold progressive ballot initiatives allow for both in a single election cycle, as FL proves! #BoldWins https://t.co/Wmlr3F17Q6
Voters continue to support bold progressive policy reforms by far larger margins than they support the Dem brand in key swing states - even on issue DC-Dems long considered ‚Äútoo left.‚Äù https://t.co/nz34LRLVhd
Math for Dems: great campaigns in VA 1, 5, 6, &amp; 9 help win VA10 and (hopefully) 2 &amp; 7, which help add up to 218.	Each Dem candidate and campaign owns part of this win.

@chiefgreyfox My point about Lee was an historical one independent of Trump‚Äôs context, which I agree (from my admittedly short vantage point) was primarily about praising the long under-valued Grant.
As a historical matter, R.E. Lee was a failure as a General &amp; a statesman. He could not win major battles without a massive home field advantage and then lacked the character and patriotism to take up Grant‚Äôs repeated offers to be help reunite and reconstruct our Nation. https://t.co/KVU52tErqB

Great reflection by @Dahlialithwick on the Cville anniversary - ‚ÄúI see the first stirrings of the thing that comes after.‚Äù https://t.co/PEjOM7pyqL
Given pathetic showing today by white supremacists, Trump should be able to give the actual names of which ones he considers ‚Äúvery fine people‚Äù on that side.
The pitiful size of today‚Äôs modern Klan rally in DC reflects tireless, deliberate advocacy efforts after Cville to ensure violent racists were identified, jailed, fired, sued for libel, &amp; bankrupted. #AccountabilityMatters

Real history is slowly starting to replace revisionist propaganda. Over time, this may be the biggest blow to Lost Cause mythology since Appomattox.
The utterly different response to Cville by Dems (call for Inclusive VA) and Republicans (Gillespie‚Äôs shockingly racist campaign) produced an historic 2017 landslide that has helped to fuel the Blue Wave.
Many hate leaders and groups are now in jail, being sued, bankrupted, and fired.
In the wake of Cville, 2 of the biggest white nationalists in the White House (Bannon, Gorka) were fired and at least some voices in the media began labeling racist policies and rhetoric as racist (SMDH NPR).

Voters have felt the depth of these disruptions long before politicians, &amp; those might previously have supported marginal/symbolic reforms now hear old/small reforms as woefully out of touch.
Bold progressive ideas are becoming mainstream w/ incredible speed less because of ideological shifts than economic and social realities.
The confusion comes from seeing things through a lens of mythical centrism rather than scale that solves problems at the kitchen table.
Pundits remain confused about "red state Dems" championing debt-free community college, criminal justice reform, living wages and busting up monopolies, but these positions have already gone from marginal to mainstream.
Dem 2020 hopefuls are not "lurching left" ‚Äî they are going BOLD. This shift is vital to Dem victories because (1) bold is the new mainstream of American politics and (2) scale rather than ideology is where the Warren/Warner wings of the party unite.

RT @brennanmgilmore: Yes Santa Claus, there is a Virginia.
So proud of my beloved Virginia tonight. Thanks to tireless efforts of tens of thousands this year, likely that Medicaid will be expanded for 400k w/new Delegates.
VA House Caucus has called 16 flipped seats which would = 50/50. 3 more seats close enough for recounts, one is only 12 votes! #BFD

Wendy Gooditis championed Medicaid expansion in her campaign and now can fight for it in the state house. Congrats @WendyforDel!
Look closely @VVforDelegate (HD 72) and @debrarodman73 (HD 73) in Henrico. They were just elected to two seats that no Dem bothered to contest for a decade.
And rounding out the top of the ticket -- @MarkHerringVA is rightly re-elected as Attorney General! Congrats Mark!
Another headline for tonight: @FairfaxJustin was just elected Lt Gov -- only the second African-American elected statewide since the Civil War. Congrats my friend!
Tonight was an enormous victory for an inclusive Virginia -- congrats to Gov-elect @RalphNortham and the people of Virginia for rejecting the politics of hate and embracing opportunity for all

The next 24 hrs will decide the next 14 yrs of our Commonwealth -- none of us should wake up Wed. wondering what else we could have done.
So tonight, please, post your own story about why you're voting and sign up for one last GOTV shift tomorrow at https://t.co/eBGA0KLXTv
But that's why we do this. That's why GOTV matters. That's why elections matter. B/c the results will impact the daily lives of millions.
Or that tomorrow's results could bring 400k Virginians health care. Or that one candidate wants to ban abortion and make it harder to vote.
And they don't know that tomorrow's results could change the fact that we have a minimum wage $1.25/hour lower than WV
But I've also met workers this yr putting in 80 hrs/wk @ 2 jobs, for less than $30k/yr + haven't had time to read up on tomorrow's election.
And only one candidate has demonstrated a willingness to tackle the school to prison pipeline and invest more money in public education
Parents and teachers braved rain to knock doors for the first time, b/c they're sick of seeing support staff cut from their public schools
They're grabbing a clipboard and organizing friends with the urgency of a generation that has glimpsed an inclusive VA and won't let it go.
I've met young people who came of age under Pres. Obama and assumed we could never slide backwards on the path towards equality and justice.
Every single GOP delegate voted to block Medicaid expansion -- so 400k Virginians can't access covered mental health/addiction services...
In rural VA a nurse came to a canvass kickoff from the graveyard shift, b/c she's seen addicted patients who might be alive today w/Medicaid
Headed to final event of election eve. Wanted to share a few stories from GOTV tour across Commonwealth over last 3 days...
And given number of candidates running, this deserves another post too. These 54 have worked so hard -- get out and support them tomorrow! https://t.co/JDnsJ2cE8I
Given number of takes this vid required, deserves more than 1 post. Polls close in less than 24 hours - make a plan! https://t.co/eOQ4ksWVut https://t.co/JFf2Ni7Uwb

GOP delegates have used gerrymandered map to rig the system so they can choose their voters instead of the other way around.
Why does VA have minimum wage lower than WV? Because gerrymandered map lets GOP delegates choose their voters.
Why did GOP delegates vote to defund Planned Parenthood? Because gerrymandered map lets them choose their voters.
Why did every GOP delegate feel comfortable voting against Medicaid expansion? Because gerrymandered map lets them choose their voters.

@EdWGillespie That vote has prevented tens of thousands from accessing addiction + mental health services while the opioid epidemic kills 3 Virginians/day
@EdWGillespie That vote has made it more likely that Virginia's rural hospitals (the top employer in 82% of VA rural counties) will go bankrupt
@EdWGillespie That vote blocked 400k Virginians (including 2300 in Wash Co.) from accessing health care, costing us 30k jobs and our state $10 bill.
