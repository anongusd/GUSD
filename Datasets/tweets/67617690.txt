Remember conservatives, there's one thing worse than @realDonaldTrump in the White House and that is @SenSanders or @HillaryClinton.
@HillaryClinton epitomizes the definition of 'politcal greed'
So @realDonaldTrump is accused of being 'unpresidential' but when obama breaches the separation of powers, its ok cua he wears sunglasses.
I can no longer listen to that jackass @SenSanders speak. And he has filed to attack hillary clinton in the way he could have.

I guarantee that it is 95-5%, way out of proportion for where the Arab world's real problems lie.
Read all of the pro-palestinian material then tell me what % they rail on Israel & the % they deal with issues of Arab on Arab suppression.

Minorities can be racist, hateful, murdering, and liberals will ignore. See Schiller when presented with Hamas/Hezbollah
As long as you are a minority, there is nothing you can do to offend a liberal. You will always remain the underdog in need of favoring
However, Liberals are discriminatory all of the time; in favor of those they view as the underdogs
To liberals, being deemed as discriminatory is the single worst crime.
Jonathan Pollard needs to remain in prison where he belongs.

@TheCaisom Perhaps your blog will address the lack of economic, social and financial freedom affecting 200+ million across the muslim world.
@TheCaisom It's interesting how much energy is put into Israel with no effort addressing the lack of rights and freedoms in the muslim world

The liberal obsession with minority rights has gone to an extreme when they support the illegal over the legal. #jcot

@TheCaisom So why don't Arab governments listen to their people? And why are they so far from granting full civil rights?
@TheCaisom Many countries only care about the Palestinians in so much as they can be used to delegitimize Israel. Sad but true.
@TheCaisom Speaking of rights. How are the rights of women, gays and minorities in Gaza and the rest of the Arab world these days?
@TheCaisom The answer is no cuz deep down you are offended at the existence of Israel.Like others you don't truly care about Palestinians.
@TheCaisom Does the fact that Palestinians never actually administered "Palestine" cause you to be outraged? Do you protest Jordan? Turkey?
@TheCaisom So having no country before is different than having no country now. Yah, ok. There never was a Palestine. There could be.
@TheCaisom Did you ever protest when Jordan was "occupying" Palestine? No. And don't ignore the issue of hypocrisy. It's your biggest one.
@TheCaisom How much do you tweet about Iranian interference in Gaza or Lebanon? War between shia and sunni. Not much, probably.
@TheCaisom Interesting, because teaching children anti-semitism and practicing terrorism is a pretty clear path to war.
@TheCaisom Well, it's not a state yet. But it is something they should aspire to.

Let's be honest, #1 reason that the Middle East hates Israel: Shame. Shame they've lost wars, shame they can't keep up on any measure.
Extremist Muslims would kill 1000 muslims in order to kill one jew. And call it victory. #jcot

The U.S. would be a better if we had 3-5 viable political parties; economic marketplace is far more dynamic than our political marketplace
@CBalling Following you now!
@CBalling I don't know Daniel Lapin, who's that? MA is a one party state, and there are conservative Ds. People are afraid to vote R.
Our friends from Israel are coming over today. I will see what they think about Obama #jcot

When really, honestly and truly tested on his character, what did Sen. Kennedy do? I can't let go of it.
Last night I had the opportunity to give a Fox Radio reporter in Hyannis a "different" opinion of Ted Kennedy #jcot
Call out the double standard. Don't accept it. #jcot
Jews are 2 defensive on the issue of Israel. When Israel is accused, we should ask, what are you doing on Saudi, Venezuela, Iran? #jcot
Jews who are conservative are equally capable of "tikkun olam". It's not for liberal jews only. #tcot

Strangely enough, I am headed to Hyannis tonight. Coincidence.
I will withhold all my Teddy K thoughts until tomorrow. It won't be easy.
Hey UN, what are you saying about Gilad Shalit?  #giladshalit
I think GOP House candidates should run stealth, voter ID and GOTV campaigns. Pure retail, below the radar.
GOP believes in providing sustainable opportunity. Democrats believe in giving stuff. Voters need to see that 1 is better than 2.
This guy is a genius RT @andrewbreitbart: At the core of the GOP/LIBERTARIAN schism is Ls just hate the GOP aesthetic.
@andrewbreitbart Totally agree. As a Jewish Conservative, I Just wrote that same thing yesterday. Jews fear these guys; I used to.
@Gerrymandering1 Very cool, guys. Best of luck with the documentary. I am a firm believer that our core problems are structural.
Cheney's issue is that he isn't likeable. But he's friggin right: http://tinyurl.com/l5rwux

Liberal obsession with enhanced interrogation is maddening. Don't I have a right to not live in fear?
Liberals tend to forget the simplest most fundamental things: like that bad guys are "bad" guys.
Republicans need to be equally critical of their own party as we are of the other. Not tear each other apart, but keep principals first.
Just because I'm Jewish doesn't mean I can't like country music ans NASCAR.

Gerrymandering is an enormous problem here in the U.S. Non-competitive seats undermine competitiveness & democracy.

Vote on principals; go post-racial RT @ConservativeGal: 96% of all black voters voted Obama, 55% of all white voters voted McCain.
Jeff Jacoby has it right: If Sen. Kennedy wants MA to have representation, then RESIGN NOW! http://bit.ly/46RfIe
"Scottish Justice Minister"? Isn't that an oxymoron?
Jews are generally scared of evangelicals. They shouldn't be.
Huckabee says that evangelicals are more supportive of Israel than most Jews http://bit.ly/3S3yfj
The Kennedy "mystique" is a scary relic. It's time to grow up, Massachusetts. We are the cradle of democracy, let's show it.
Now if Obama was so concerned about "misinformation", don't you think it would have made sense if he had slowed down to begin with?
Scotland's actions are shameful #Lockerbie
A boldfaced attempt to keep power in the family. Anti-democratic, selfish Joe Kennedy Sr.-style bullshit: http://bit.ly/1QXq9a
My most important issues: a sustainable US economy and security for the US & Israel.
Jews have historically been knee jerk liberals. It's time step back and think about what that means.
In my opinion, a true conservative wants to conserve the environment for future generations.
I was a Dem for a long time so that helps me understand what issues cloud their reason
The Health for Clunkers plan is just not sustainable. I fear for our sustainability http://ow.ly/kQga
