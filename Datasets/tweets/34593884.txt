Hi @JohnBerman @newday  I sent this to the wrong alisyn camerota, someone involved with Fox &amp; Friends. Alisyn u said the other day there are no pics of Trump laughing. Yes there are. When his Russian handlers were in the Oval Office he laughed hysterically never looked happier.
Dem Precinct leaders &amp;seated members, if yr unhappy w/the way @TomPerez is destroying the DNC by allowing @BernieSanders anything he wants, threaten yr state party chair with bringing them down &amp; your resignation if Sanders runs in our party &amp; is invited to our debates.Screw him

If Sanders runs in Dem Primaries &amp;our debates &amp; given access 2 DNC computers, I'm out of the party &amp; politics. For now, I'm a Precinct leader in PBC FL	@kenmartin73 @troymprice @JayParmley @terrierizzo @alexrooker @laningforwi @pademschair @DPVAChair @BrandonDillon75 @byronwbrown
If the State Democratic Chairs allow Tom Perez to allow Sanders to join our Debates, have space on the DNC website and databank again so he can steal other candidates info and allow him to run in our primaries, EVERY State Democratic Chair should be recalled &amp;voted out, even mine
In addition @BernieSanders how come u never told the gullible &amp; inexperienced kids who followed you like dogs what a liar Jill Stein was bcz she said banks never paid back TARP $ &amp;u never told them that Hillary would be a good Pres bcz u wanted Trump to win.  Where r yr taxes SOB
And @BernieSanders u are clueless that 70% of voters will vote for Medicare for all while they already have great insurance &amp; you have no idea what it will cost Americans who already have work subsidized Ins. You and @TomPerez need to form your own party and stop screwing us.
NRA WHORE who whined abt HRC speaking fee from Goldman Sachs @BernieSanders is back. U stupidly wanted $18 min wage, u thought a $35B stock xfer tax wld pay for free educ for 28M, U hacked into DNC HRC files 2x open door 4Russia, u gave no $ to the DNC, u can't be in our Debates
@alisyn_camerota love your show and I can't stand Republican Trojan Horse Scarborough and his sycophants who he shuts up anytime they say something bad about Republicans and his Manic Mika. That spot should be yours for the taking.
.@alisyn_camerota u said this morning there r no pics of Trump laughing. Yes there r. When his Russian handlers were in the Oval Office he laughed like my HS Chem lab when we used burettes &amp; the teacher said she was going to come around &amp; greese our [stop]c*cks she did use stop.
. @TomPerez is @berniesanders, after he broke into DNC HRC filles 2x opening door for Putin, said Dems rigged system, an NRA whore, no tax returns, never said HRC w/b a good Pres, not a penny to DNC, allowed in our debate? ANSWER! 	https://t.co/jyepVByA7n		https://t.co/jyepVByA7n
Hey Tom Perez, after breaking into DNC HRC filles twice opening door for Putin, saying Dems rigged the system, was an NRA whore, no tax returns, never said HRC would be a good let alone a great president, not a penny to DNC	https://t.co/jyepVByA7n
Scumbag @Morning_Joe tells us he's not a Repub anymore, b*llshit as he constantly defends Rs when they're attacked by his team &amp; he shuts them down. Today, the SOB is calling Trump a Democat while his R party enables Trump's evil while he &amp;Kasich helped cause our TrklDwn sh*thole
Hey, @BernieSanders we hear all this talking about the Russians breaking into Hillary's files on the DNC website just like you did twice, remember that? Not only where you  a whore for the NRA but a hacker too. A traitor also? @SRuhle @ChrisCuomo @maddow @andersoncooper
@leahstokes @NicholsUprising I'm not disagreeing but we need many more discussions on this. The electorate can't even understand how they're getting screwed by trickle down economics, so having them understand thermodynamics a reserved power etc means the electorate needs to learn before they vote.
@leahstokes @NicholsUprising started fast enough to get bigger superfast turbines powered by gas initially going. It might not be that feasible to do yet, &amp; that never bothers AOC. Spain had a huge blackout said to cost a billion $ bcz of the using of wind. Have u heard anything about Spain's blackout?
@leahstokes @NicholsUprising Leah, I just had a conversation w/a client who is an energy engineer who has written software to prevent blackouts. He told me Spain has a huge amt of wind turbines &amp;they approached him to have him adapt his software to wind.  There was a problem w/getting wind turbines cont..
@SenGillibrand You gratuitously stand for nobody but yourself just like that scumbag pal of yours @BernieSanders with whom you conspired, along with his pal @TomPerez to get rid of @alfranken. Don't hide behind women, you're just an egregious selfish pig.
@tweetmommybop I bet a could do more damage walking to the examing room after I come off the Har-Tru tennis courts than those walkers can do.  How stupid to install that kind of floor.
@TheOnion Palliative government or do we attack this fascist imbecile &amp; his disgusting &amp; egregious party for all their lies and graft? Let's finally expose the Republicans. On the  @SRuhle show they were asking if Trump's tax cut would work. FFS, 38 yrs of failed TrklDwnEcon isn't enough?
@SenSasse Really, then add a 5% tax on AGI, for those of you assholes who want to get rid of abortion, to cover the lifetime of exp these unwanted kids will cause, food, shelter, medical, clothing, education, payment for lawyers, penalty fees, retraining and victim settlements or shut up!
@JoyceWhiteVance Is this show he and Putin are putting on for us by walking away from a treaty against midrange nuclear arms.  Putin wants Trump to spend like the 70s &amp; 80s USSR which led to its unraveling. America, wake the hell up and get Trump out of Washington. Contact your Reps &amp; Senators
@kurteichenwald I see the biographies Malcolm Ten and the Two Corinthians
Have u gone to Starbutts today? If so, you're probably an imbecile who voted for Jill Stein or didn't vote at all in the 2016 election. Get your asses the hell out of Starbutts go to Dunkin Donuts or 7-Eleven or any other coffee shop. Grow a backbone &amp; let Howard Schultz bleed.
Tough tennis lesson today &amp; I had 2go2 a meeting at 5:30. I was dragging. I might have gotten a big iced coffee from Starbucks but f*** that, I took my refrigerated coffee added some Lactaid milk &amp;some ice in a quart container and it was glorious. Don't need Starbuctts or Schultz
@GovHowardDean Hit him where it hurts, bury Starbucks. The electorate doesn't do enough to learn what jerks many of these politicians are. We know what Howard Schultz is now and we have to have the strength to make our voices heard. One way is to let Starbucks die, where he loses billions.
If we buy coffee from Starbucks, the dividends Schultz earns funds his CAMPAIGN TO SCREW AMERICA.  Republicans always seem to find these scumbags who ruin elections for us. They did it in Florida, a Trump pal Jeff Greene ran in Dem primary for gov &amp; helped knock out Levine.
and if you want dessert coffee, get some chocolate syrup and cream and put it in a blender and spray some whipped cream on top. Add ice and it's a Macchiato or Iced Coffee, amazing, huh, instead of dropping $20 bill for 4 drinks, pay under a dollar &amp;get some revenge &amp;save America
Time Dems exact some blood from those who screw us. @HowardSchultz doesn't give a sh*t what happens to America so LETS BOYCOTT STARBUCKS &amp; destroy that overpriced Co. &amp; coffee that tastes like wood. Buy a Melitta cone, w/Costco Col Suprmo coffee, 15 cents for 18oz better coffee.
Hey @jaketapper what kind of an a**hole would continually put @ninaturner on their Sunday morning talk show? Haven't u caused enuf damage already? Do u want to help split the vote again @SymoneDSanders &amp; @BernieSanders  Y don't u join their Our Revolution w/ Sarandon&amp;Dawson too
@BernieSanders @PoliScrutiny101 Typical Sanders anarchist BS &amp; lies. Blame the producers? Hopefully he'll need OxyContin one day &amp;he won't be able to get it.

@davidsirota @MarlaMayes How ironic that stupid fake progressives like all u who follow  Sirota, Bernie Bros, are responsible for why the RI pension system lost 2 billion dollars thanks to those of you idiots who helped elect George W Bush by supporting Ralph Nader. Raymundo saved the pension system.
@SenWarren follow me so I can tell you something about you ultra millionaire tax.
Dem PmBchCnty Sup of Elctns Susan Bucher was suspended by GOP Gov DeSantis for political BS.  Listen to Trump fascists shouting her down. All Dems &amp; mod Repubs must unite to purge fascism. Give $, time &amp; enthusiasm to make sure we don't bcm Nazi Germany. https://t.co/rCx2r3Bwsd

@SenGillibrand No f*cking way as you GRATUITOUSLY conspired w/Bernie Sanders &amp; Tom Perez to weaken the Democratic Party by getting rid of 1 of our outstanding stars, @alfranken. Get out of my sight. Did Perez make sure you had no  primary for your NY Senate race, which we all wanted you to lose
You MUST operate the government through disputes, which can continue separately unless you're a 3 year old or a Russian agent trying to disrupt everything in the USA. Obviously it's both &amp; those who vote for Republicans are clueless assholes hiding behind American flag pins.
This Russian Federation flag pin is  on https://t.co/p6sDGMEZOX &amp; all Republican slugs &amp; traitors should be required to turn in their US flag pins &amp; buy this one, as you are now Patriots of the Russian Federation not the USA &amp; enablers of Trump. How can u look at yourselves? https://t.co/miArv6Tfo2
Us Democrats need to wear flag pins and take America back from those motherfuker Republican traitors who are selling us out to Russia. We should have a flag pin with a D on it to let people know we're not the same scumbags who enable Trump to be a Russian agent. https://t.co/oSifmQmwIz
@SRuhle @OurPowderDry Oops that was Steph.
@SenSanders @ninaturner Isn't this just precious since Mr. President is Trump thanks to you two. Turner campaigned w/Jill Stein  &amp; Sanders is responsible for murders after he voted down the Brady Bill and had the nerve to criticize Hillary for a stupid speaking fee. U can't B part of the D Party again!
@SRuhle @OurPowderDry Step, we need to wake up the sleeping giants of the electorate so they observe what's going on, think &amp; learn. Sometimes we need to use strong language to get their attention 2 let them know how important this stuff is &amp; there are no easy answers. Even w/Trump gone the GOP sucks
@CharlesPPierce @OurPowderDry So true!
@DrGianRico At one time we all liked him because he was constantly complaining about everything and of course in doing so he caught many of the issues we care about. But a person who calls himself a progressive and votes against Brady 6 times is an accomplice to murder, like Bush and Trump.
And to think about all the "pure progressive" assholes who didn't vote for Hillary because of Repub lies about Whitewater, Vince Foster, CGI that saved tens of millions of lives vs the crooked Trump Foundation, emails and Benghazi.. U were disgustingly stupid, FIX IT this time! https://t.co/Vwly0QSaZo

America, Trump &amp; his Republican enablers r grabbing your pussies like they've done for 38 years w/ TrklDwnEcon that has made us weak, took $ out of your Social Security &amp; drastically widened the wealth gap. Grow a spine &amp; throw all Repubs out of all gov't or u &amp; yr kids will pay

@TomSteyer Keep in mind, 5 billion dollars is a  down payment. Trump knows how to overcharge, for which he will get kickbacks from his Pals that have memberships at Mar-A-Lago. That's why they're there, to arrange for kickback conspiracies like this.
Moderate Reoublican pols, you cannot defend the 38yr debacle called TrklDwnEcon, huge tax reductions to any super wealthy American w/o req STIMULUS &amp; we will make u drown in that quicksand. Now u enable a megalomaniac. It's time to switch parties bcz u look like evil a**holes.
@neeratanden @NiteniteMelissa Neera, we have a problem with these Sanders fan. They need to be in their own party so we can attack them because they're a Trojan Horse infiltrated by Russians.

@hangcat2 @GovHowardDean In an asshole's psychedelic trip, that's all Bernie Sanders could ever win because Americans wouldn't vote for a socialist Pig like that who is involved with Russia, who didn't show his tax returns and was a f****** w**** for the NRA by voting down the Brady Bill six times.
@JamesMArcher @GovHowardDean Imbecilic comment the same sh*t and lies we heard from Ralph Nader, Sanders, Stein, Sarandon, Dawson, Turner scumbag lowlifes
@thepoliticalcat @GovHowardDean In hell!
@GovHowardDean The only one who could take down Trump is Michael Bloomberg. He has the information, he knows New York and he could step all over that line bug Trump. Sanders is a f****** joke and Beto never won an election of any consequence other than an engineered gerrymandered District.

State Dem chairs r NOT going TO  get rid of disappearing, no fight useless @TomPerez. When I Qed mine she said RNC chair was never around either. Disgusting ans bcz they had Trump. We have 2threaten to recall them &amp;other things bcz we need a Franken or Dean there. Do it NOW https://t.co/mPn8AnJQAS

@Redpainter1 @rhonda_harbison My niece and almost step daughter work and &amp; their 4 kids are incredibly happy and well adjusted because their patents are great.  A lot of that has to do with easy the children are.
I love you @SRuhle but you tell viewers, econ is so strong. Most of the jobs added come from full-time jobs w/good wages, overtime &amp; benefits replaced by part-time jobs w/no benefits &amp; no overtime at minimum wage. As far as Corp  Inc tax, 700 have inverted &amp; pay no tax here
@dylanmsmitty @scarletsusieq W/regards to Bklyn&amp;Maricopa he pissed &amp; moaned he got cheated bcz ballots were missing &amp;not enuf machines but these were HRC Counties. Dems will never vote 4that Socialist PIG in Gen'l so don't waste yr time&amp;effort. He's hated like Nader. To the kids, U want Trump as yr FUTURE?
@dylanmsmitty @scarletsusieq Never criticized Stein or Turner, voted with NRA, no tax returns, lied about funding for free college, $18 MinWage ridiculous, broke in HRC files on DNC twice, whined abt getting cheated in Bklyn &amp; Maricopa Cty, praised Sarandon and Dawson, never told his kids HRC w/b a good pres
@LOULOUGUINNESS @davidsirota @SusanSarandon @TheSandersInst And we're officially done as I block you and everyone else who loved that picture of Sirota &amp; Sarandon, two haters of the Democratic Party and decency. Maybe they were all NRA supporters like Bernie Sanders, who didn't care about deaths caused by his voting down the Brady Bill.
@LOULOUGUINNESS @davidsirota @SusanSarandon @TheSandersInst I don't care who U R. When I see fake progressives BLAMING Hillary 4anything when that scumbag Sanders divided the Dem Party like f*****g Ralph Nader and Susan Sarandon did in 2000, I don't give a crap about my manners and I want to just shut them &amp; their disgusting lies down.
Beware of Russian Bots and Russian trolls they're all over Twitter and they're trying to cause more disharmony by creating a desire for @BernieSanders when there is none. He can never get a majority. He's dead in Democratic politics. His lies enabled Trump. Rigged system my ass.
@LOULOUGUINNESS @davidsirota @SusanSarandon @TheSandersInst You're ecstatic about the disharmony and you're helping exacerbate it.  People here aren't fooled by you and your mission.
@LOULOUGUINNESS @davidsirota @SusanSarandon @TheSandersInst I don't think you're a woman and I don't think you are an American. You're probably Russian. Or maybe the Republican party has put together their own group to cause confusion among the electorate, the only way they can survive. STFU about Hillary, Sanders/Stein f***** up election
@LOULOUGUINNESS @davidsirota @SusanSarandon @TheSandersInst You're so full of crap. I don't think you're from this country at all &amp;u  lost respect for Hillary bcz she lied about the Bosnia airport what abt f****** Sanders who lied about his participation for the NRA and how many dead people did that cause, scumbot, somethings wrong abt u
@LOULOUGUINNESS @davidsirota @SusanSarandon @TheSandersInst By the way, you're not on Facebook, so maybe you're not a Russian bot, maybe you're a Russian or Republican troll. But what you say is so false and so disgusting. How about your boy being a whore for the NRA? Was that okay for you? You disgust me.
@LOULOUGUINNESS @davidsirota @SusanSarandon @TheSandersInst How were Americans were forced, Comrade?  Children were lied to so badly by POS Bernie Sanders, Nina Turner, Susan Sarandon and Jill Stein that they didn't know WTF to do, many voted for Stein and many stayed home and not once did POS BS say that Hillary w/b a good president
RT @lmorihouse: @davidsirota @SusanSarandon @TheSandersInst Great shot!😍
@davidsirota @worcwriter @SusanSarandon @TheSandersInst Boycott @Showtime for hiring Sarandon on Ray Donovan. I did and stopped paying for Showtime. Screw them.  She's a traitor who f*cked up 2 elections. For God sakes, don't read Hillary hater, Sirota.
@LOULOUGUINNESS @davidsirota @SusanSarandon @TheSandersInst How do we know that all these idiots who support Sarandon and Sirota are not Russian bots because everthing they say is completely full of sh*t. Great woman my ass. She helped f*ck up 2 elections. What kind of jerks think that's great? RUSSIAN BOTS
@dramatbardzo @davidsirota @SusanSarandon @TheSandersInst A completely moronic statement.
@davidsirota @worcwriter @SusanSarandon @TheSandersInst These 2 R completely repulsive 2me.  Any member of the Democratic Party DECs who quote them or Bernie Sanders or Jill Stein supporter Nina Turner are committing acts against the Democratic Party &amp;the oath they signed &amp;should be removed from the Party. WTF, have we leaned Nothing?
@daveweigel Imagine how big D win w/b if BS stooge @TomPerez who changed everything 4BS, went after Franken &amp; got rid of super delegates, if Perez put together a message, a LIE assault team &amp; got known Dems on Cable news. CNN only had BS &amp; Turner &amp; Symone Sanders. Perez must go before 2019
@daveweigel That SOB @BernieSanders besides whoring for the NRA and besides not submitting his taxes never told his supporters that Hillary would make a great or even a good president. Many went to Jill Stein who he never attacked but Hillary rigged the system. Dems will never vote for BS
@neeratanden @daveweigel Neera, you know, 10% of the population can control the Senate. If we don't explain what Dems are &amp; how incredibly evil &amp;stupid Repubs are for trickle down economics w/o requiring stimulius, we will never win but for little victories &amp;then we'll lose them again and never progress
W/o a msg thanks to @TomPerez, every Dem had to fight against perception that Trump econ was great &amp;they were never reminded what happened to that GREAT BUSH ECON. Dem Committee ppl DO NOT vote for County DECs board members unless they vow to replace Perez NOW! How stupid are we?
.@TomPerez worked 4Bernie Sanders, changed platform for him, made Ellison vice chair, removed super dels from 1st ballot &amp; let Americans believe that non progressive Dems were rigging &amp; were less pure. He lost my trust &amp; I will vote against anyone who doesn't take him down.
.@TomPerez had larger neg effect  this last election than Russia by Dems not going for a full blown attack against REPUBS who have been screwing US for 38 years. Any D that keeps Perez at the DNC must go too. Yes, we cld have done a lot better if voters were told what GOP did.
@dcpoll @DanielBeerthuis Great put down, love it!
Listen to weekly podcasts from @AnaKasparian called "No Filter." Ana is terrific and very up on the news but she also has a great understanding about how things work including taxes and economics. She's part of The Young Turks but this podcast is hers. https://t.co/69TruolBVO
.@tomstyer you're a great American and impeachment is already long overdue. However, I think our biggest problems is that 10% of the country can elect a 50-50 Senate and when Rs have the White House it's like a super majority these days. We need to educate America first.
This is for @TomStyer @georgesoros @BillGates @WarrenBuffett u who know better than anyone how the econ works but all of u need 2get2 your state delegates so that we can get a DNC Chair who understands the importance of a meesage crushing Reps on economy	 https://t.co/onTUydC4iZ https://t.co/vGxEhYDvR9
Post this on your Twitter pages &amp; Facebook pages as elections r  coming next week &amp; @TomPerez needs to go. Other choices w/b great like @alfranken and @GovHowardDean. We need someone to attack Trump lies while Perez was going Door2Door, how ridiculous. Shldve been a landslide!
Elections r coming up 4all state &amp;county Dem Party offices. If they don't want 2remove @TomPerez as DC Chair NO vote for them. He should never be in charge of GOTMessage! Every race was burdened w/no message &amp; BS abt Trump econ &amp;401Ks. (Obama's increases not Trumps-remember 2008)
@caknox1 @EarlOfEnough @StormMela @NancyPelosi Speaker Pelosi did a tour of small "Town Halls", with some good people incuding @DWStweets, a real DNC Chair unlike Sanders' tool  @TomPerez, and she was impressive, strong, knew her tax law &amp; a beautiful woman. No wonder shit4brains Republican  SLUGS attack her. She is super!
.@TomSteyer @georgesoros @BillGates @WarrenBuffett. Nobody knows better than u how stupid it was to give huge TrklDwn tax cuts w/o requiring stimulus. We MUST teach America about that, econ multiplier, interest on debt &amp; Trickle Up economics. We need yr $ to educate, WE CAN DO IT
@paulkrugman @supertaschablue The DNC stopped existing when @TomPerez became chair. No messaging, no presence on Cable TV news. So Perez will not promote interviews w/white women Rs, bcz they won't vote for Sanders and he seems to be focusing canvassing, which any volunteer can do. That's Y win was anemic.
Welcome to Twitter @annecorio
Anyone know know when the next election is for the DNC Chair? The last one was Feb 25, 2017. @TomPerez do you know? You &amp; Sanders need to go &amp;super delegates need to come back. We need a message &amp; a response team &amp; a presence on TV other than Sanders &amp; Turner. Sooner the better
All DNC delegates in all states should be charged with voting out the DNC Chair @TomPerez and the Vice CHAIR, @keithellison **IMMEDIATELY** We need to make sure this happens. 		THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO MESSAGE AND NO RESPONSE TO ALL OR ANY TRUMP LIES. Pathetic! https://t.co/QpWZAaY4Zl
DNC has to say bye to @TomPerez. Nice guy but even w/think tanks Dems had NO message that would TAKE away Trump's bragging about Obama's econ &amp; take away a reason to vote for GOP. They ruin economies, Dems build them. @alfranken u should become DNC CHAIR @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer
Hello Speaker @NancyPelosi I'm w/u 100%. For 2 years I have been  asking u to change the DNC Chair &amp;wrote to you &amp; @SenSchumer abt how vital educating the voter is. You better address this or 2020 will be horrible for Dems. Call me &amp; include Chuck. I'm dead serious, not joking.
@NthingInPrtculr @peterdaou @TomPerez @SenSanders @cenkuygur @AnaKasparian @AmirAminiMD This guy, who is he? Anyone know him. Could be a Russian or a Trump. Y is he talking about Sanders now. @Oprah said she's an independent which was an asshole thing to do, especially now. Big disappoinment Bernie discussion is for Nov 7th. Russians &amp; GOP will do lots of shit.
@NthingInPrtculr @peterdaou @TomPerez @SenSanders @cenkuygur @AnaKasparian @AmirAminiMD Don't believe any of this Bernie shit unless know the person well or can identify it. Too often they are put here to f*** up elections. Don't ever allow a Trump to win when a douchebag tells u how bad Bernie's opponents are or use rigged. Seen that two f**king times. 2000 &amp; 2016

I am using this in my precinct in Florida because the DNC  and the Chair @TomPerez  does nothing to explain the Trump and Republican lies about the economy so everyone who votes for Republicans because of the great economy is on the head of Perez. https://t.co/8SRtRdOq6q
@TomSteyer Tom, the first step is to learn what you're voting for and I hope that in the 2020 election you help get behind that. It's time we stop voting for trickle down economics, especially middle class voters who gets screwed by it most &amp; giving away our econ to corps that inverted.
If you live in Georgia don't be an imbecile and check to see if your name has been purged, especially if you're an African American. Brian Kemp, Sec'y of State is purging people so he can beat Stacey Abrams 4Guv. If U R young &amp; don't vote U R an ASSHOLE. 		https://t.co/lFTDWt2CQe

@bendreyfuss @CleoEverest She was the one who took the risk of a polygraph. That act alone, knowing how she would have screwed up herself and her family for life if she were lying, is total corroboration for me. I bet they tested the 2 asshole Frat Boys w/a polygraph to see how they'd do &amp; they failed.
@senorrinhatch @mschlapp What a sick POS Hatch is while a traumatized 15 year old was corroborated by a lie detector test.

Hey @TomPerez does this article tell you something, like it's time to step down as DNC Chair?  You're  failing abysmally at smacking down GOP &amp;Trump lies. Organize an assault response team or get out! @SRuhle @AliVelshi @AriMelber @KatyTurNBC @maddow  https://t.co/jdNnWlE4PQ
Perhaps it is time for all Democrats to unfriend Republicans who voted for and support Trump. I don't mean on Facebook I mean in life. This could also go for some family members too and let these people become friendly with people like them and see if that's okay with them.
How is econ doing &amp;how did we &amp;r we making out w/no stimulus required TrklDwnEcon? Should Dems be talking abt this on Cable News? @TomPerez feel free to jump in since u r the DNC Chair &amp; u r    doing nothing. Debbie @DWStweets as one one the better Chairs WTF is w/the Dems?

@jena3307 @Amy_Siskind @NBCNews @MichaelAvenatti 100% Amy.  I'm a big fan of Avanatti but if he doesn't show his cards not only will he hurt effort to get rid of Kavanaugh but he'll lose all his credibility. I think he's too imp esp w/Chair of DNC @TomPerez who wouldn't know neg msging abt TrklDwnEcon if it hit him in the face
@LeahAnakin @ananavarro @AndrewGillum @TomPerez I never said Sanders backed him, he's Sanders stooge. Isn't it nice how a POS who isn't a Dem, never gave a penny to the DNC or down ballot candidates, told kids HRC &amp;Dems rigged the system had any say in what the DNC does including stopping superdelegates on the 1st ballot.
Heard a Russian agent kidnapped @TomPerez &amp; brought him to Russia. Dems have no msg response team to counteract Repub BS &amp; lies abt Trump &amp;GOP econ on talk shows? GRU shot the agent for helping the Ds, &amp; brought Perez back to help GOP B4 Dems replaced him. Nobody knew he was gone
@ananavarro @AndrewGillum W/b nice if Sanders stooge @tomperez organized a msg response team to tell voters diff btwn Ds &amp; Rs esp utter stupidity of TrklDwnEcon &amp; how Rs gave away to deductns w/o req any stimulus, Holy Grail of lies.  Also, Trump econ didn't start till 2/18. First yr is former POTUS'
Once again, until @NinaTurner  apologizes 4jumping from Sanders 2SUPPORTING @DrJillStein&amp;showing up at her rallies, we need 2boycott Jake Tapper for having her on his roundtable much too often. Y not include Trump's Nazis on his show if he wants diff pts of view. He's dividing us

@AlanBrewerOK what happened to your comment?  I started out nice a year ago trying to get @TomPerez to understand the problem. I've even appealed to the Florida Democratic Chair yet we see no RESPONSE ever  w/anger&amp;disgust. We can't win w/out it. Making false promises isn't enuf
I want to know if the useless Chair of the DNC @tomperez gets a team of Dem pols 4TV to contradict gains of Trump &amp; Rep econ &amp;expose what evil TrklDwnEcon did to us. Keep your eyes open 4any response bcz if we lose or our win is tempered, blame the DNC. I can't believe he's there

@DanRather @99ermikeb &amp;Maybe the most serious is lying to keep perpetuating TrklDwnEcon, which prevents us stimulating demand by creating more good jobs, increasing the minimum wage, less tax for middle class, starting the econ multiplier, building infrastructure, stim new industry &amp;healthcare.
And they deserve to lose as they threatened are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness with crap like Brett Kavanaugh and they're enabling &amp;encouraging it, disastrous TrklDwnEcon that is breaking us, not protecting our election systems and Trump giving our country to Russia. https://t.co/6QJDPD6PeW
@neilpX Yeah, I see. I didn't open that before and didn't realize what Pelosi said. She's saying the same thing I'm saying. She's assuming that the House Republicans want to get that money from middle class and poor people.
@neilpX PolitiFact says no but I think the house wants to cut Med&amp;Med and probably SS also. They have to cover the Trump tax cuts. I heard Ryan saying that they have to address entitlements and that's SS MEDandMED &amp;Safety nets to them. So, ultimately I think you're correct.

@JRubinBlogger @CeletaQ Totally agree with you Jenn.
@NBCNightlyNews @LindseyGrahamSC @NBCNews Absolutely, especially when you act innocent. How could a person wanting to be on the SupCt not call for an FBI examination of this incident &amp;reputations involved &amp;demand Mark Judge testify. There is something real to check and would prove Kavanaugh's perjury, if he did.

@RepSwalwell If the state of MD brings charges through Dr. Ford, &amp;if proper discovery happens, then maybe he could be a judicial candidate but the idea that he would accept this sham of a process assures me he should never be behind any bench and at the very least, not get this confirmation.
@RepSwalwell Plus no discovery. The state of MD should bring charges against Kavanaugh bcz he shouldn't be on the SupCt or the Court of App or any Court. He should get a job as defense lawyer, inconvenient for him, but NEVER a trier of fact deciding our values, which w/b devastating to US.

@Failure_Con @SenSanders @BernieSanders But you Progressive peanut brauns never answer the question of how can you vote for a pig who voted against Brady 5 times and why didn't he produce his taxes that gave Trump cover on that issue and why didn't he tear Jill Stein apart for lying, like he lies all the time?
@Failure_Con @SenSanders @BernieSanders I've been talking about ending income tax inversion well before Bernie Sanders ever brought it up. But guess what, we have to win first &amp;an old lying socialist misogynist anarchist man is not going to get votes despite what he thinks and what you think. He&amp;Nader can rot in hell
@Failure_Con @SenSanders @BernieSanders Snap your fingers and add 6.2% as a payroll tax then employers have to pay on top of the 7.65 they have to pay for Social Security and Medicare so that is 13.85% and you want no maximum on that. It's not going to happen bcz people won't vote for it.
@Failure_Con @SenSanders @BernieSanders Who do u think is going to vote for  him with proposals like that. I already kicked the s*** out of his college for all bcz he's never going to get 75 billion out of stock transfer tax all you get was 35 billion and that would provide $1,250 per student per year, that enough, NO

Hillary got the nomination because she was the best candidate ever to be president and you will helped f*** that up with Sanders. Are proud? 2 times in 16 years, assholes
@Failure_Con @SenSanders I support single-payer. First we have to get elected, second we have to do is teach the electorate what Republicans have done for 38 years, then we pass laws to raise taxes so  we can have these things. Anarchist assholes, BS, Nader &amp;Stein want to bring it all down.
@Failure_Con @SenSanders Sure, we needed more assholes &amp; clueless children voting for scum like Bernie Sanders, Ralph Nader and Jill Stein. that's what the superdelegates r there for &amp;that's what they did, little did we realize what kind of a bastard BS was to make sure his kids didn't vote for Hillary.
@Failure_Con @SenSanders Beg the country?  He should have told his followers that Hillary wld be a great pres or even a good one which he never did, not once. He should have torn apart Jill Stein's lies. He should have stopped Sarandon and Dawson from spreading lies. His Nina Turner jumped on w/Stein WTF
@Failure_Con @SenSanders @BernieSanders Who is Cranky? Is that BS? I call him liar.
@Failure_Con @SenSanders @BernieSanders So BS y were u not able to make copies of your tax returns? You gave Trump cover on that issue you SOB?    You knew u were losing and you didn't want Hillary to win bcz then you'd be done so you diluted that tax return issue bcz your children wouldn't understand what you did.
@Failure_Con @SenSanders @BernieSanders Free college on a stock xfer tax that would bring in $71 Billion. A ½% tax on both sides of every trade would knock out computerized trading &amp; day traders leaving $35B to educate 28 million students bcz more wld go  if it's free. $1,250 per year per student? He's a liar. BS BS
@Failure_Con @SenSanders @BernieSanders Once BS is watching, why did u never criticize Jill Stein after she said to "his children" that they should get their loans expunged because the banks never had to pay back the TARP money, a lie, but BS wanted Hillary to lose. In his book he praised Sarandon &amp;Dawson, f**k him.
@Failure_Con @SenSanders @BernieSanders You mentioned topics without being specific like I did with the NRA whore's quid pro quo for the NRA  that all you "big progressives" douchebags seem to be okay with. Shoot those kids down, as long as the Socialist/anarchist wins to give them candy that they would never get.
@Failure_Con @SenSanders So Big Progressive, you're still talking BS. What did Hillary&amp;Obama do in servitude 4business on the same level that BS voted against Brady so more people would die. Some a__hole progressive told me he was protecting small gun stores, that is BS BS &amp; spells quid pro quo whore
@Failure_Con @SenSanders Did their bidding WTF does that mean? They needed her to impress their high wealth customers and that's what people like that get paid even s*** 4brains George W Bush got money like that. But you zeroed in on Hillary Clinton cuz you wanted 2ruin an election, like big Progressives
@Failure_Con @SenSanders Somebody taught you how to memorize b*llsh*t, maybe it's @BernieSanders aka BS. U made stupid allegations w/no detail like u were spoon fed talking points.Let's hear specifics from u BIG Progressive. What did u think of BS felating the NRA by voting against Brady big Progressive?

@Aaron48450855 @SenSanders Can't dude, Sanders needs 2B taken out of politics. When he lost the nomination shouldn't he have told his supporters Hillary w/b a great president? Or did he want Hillary to lose so he can have another shot in 2020? Yes, he's that much of a prick  who never showed his taxes
@Failure_Con @SenSanders As we said when we were kids, the truth hurts &amp;u have absolutely no answers for anything I said. You're furious w/Hillary for taking a $200,000 speaking fee from Goldman Sachs but you're okay with BS voting against Brady 5 times that &amp; led to deaths. What the hell are your values
@Failure_Con @SenSanders How the hell do I know you're not a Russian or Repub.  No smart Dem wld defend Sanders and call Hillary&amp;Obama corporate shills, that is outright moronic &amp;done to split us up. Maybe I'd like to ask you how are they shills and why did Sanders vote against Brady 5 times? Answer it
@SenSanders Maybe if u weren't such an asshole &amp;NRA whore, u wld have told yr supporters, the kids u lied to, that Hillary wld be a great president or even a good president but all they saw was yr miserable sourpuss face &amp;that's what u wanted bcz u wanted another shot at Trump.

People need to understand basic TrklDwnEc &amp;y that continually failed, giving top 1/10th% $40-50T of no stim tax cuts &amp;we have $25T of debt &amp;no new industry
@JJohnsonLaw @MichaelAvenatti I agree Janet but those hearings are  1 small part of the fight. Biggest part is exploding the TrklDwnEcon BS. Over 38yrs, we gave $40-50T to richest Americans w/o any req of stimulus &amp;we got multi billionaires &amp; $25T of debt. We have 2teach Americans how they're getting screwed
Great speech @BarackObama Next xxplain inversion, tax rate history, econ multipier &amp;how we gave 40-50 Trillion TrklDwn tax cuts w/o stim req or that it even be spent here. U shld have done this during yr presidency bcz ppl don't know. Do it now &amp; come to our PBCDEC TKJ dinner.

@doreeninkeles Great restaurant, maybe the best in the area. Happy birthday and enjoy!
2. Trump's first tax cut was supp to cost $1.5 trillion &amp;I think it will be $3 trillion What wld work better giving that 3 trillion to billionaires or giving 200 million families $1,500/year for 10 years? Same $3 trillion except families stimulate &amp; multiply the econ like crazy
1. Republicans, this is for you bcz I know none of u r billionaires. Rs  have been blowing TrklDwnEcon out of their asses for 38yrs, giving trillions 2 billionaires w/o a stimulstion req, blowing up debt &amp; taking it out of your SS&amp;Medicare. Ok w/that?  READ next 2.

Sound off for that POS @JoeLieberman
@JuliaAdair @SenGillibrand Sanders is a disgusting liar &amp;he was a whore 4 NRA. That SOB did whatever he cld 2make sure Trump wld win so he wld have another shot.

@JuliaAdair @SenGillibrand Hey Julia! I totally agree.

Voters have been gas-lit that econ is great &amp;U have to blow that up. @TomPerez
@AndrewGillum WRONG "progressive" message. It's a privilege we are able 2do in America. We ultimately pay 4 it anyway on an emergency basis which is much more costly. So let's do it right &amp;our econ will flourish bcz of it. Stuffing Billionaire's. w/$ didn't work. A healthier US works better!

He must be fired.  I will give up being a Democratic Precinct leader if he stays and no doubt, when Sanders is not the nominee he will lie to the children again and f**k up another election like they did in 2000 and 2016 &amp; keep Trump in the White House.

Get rid of superdelegates so 18-21y/o kids who believe Sanders lies or Rs who jump for a day have more say than exp pols, instead of organizing an assault to expose R lies &amp; stupidity of Trickle Down Econ, is y u need to resign now. You're causing trouble everywhere @TomPerez
@WalkerForFL I'm tired of the Florida progressives &amp;I am especially tired of @TomPerez &amp;for me to stay working in the Democratic Party he needs to go. I voted for Nikki Fried also.

@Karoli A president who tells his bag man to break the law &amp; he's on tape doing it &amp; to possibly have received some of that shakedown money that Cohen got from AT&amp;T &amp; those other companies 2 become friends of Trump, shouldn't pick next SupCt judge.

3. So as I was telling Advanced billing for @ATT since I had no intention of increasing costs &amp; rep lied to me abt free Direct TV I want a refund of $43 each for 2 months. Supervisor in advance billing hung up on me or got disconnected. I want this fixed. No intent to pay+ $43
2. This all started with @ATT telling me I could get unlim prem for $100 while 25gb was $110 &amp; I'd get DirecTV Now for free for a year. It was free until I got a bill on my credit card for $29 I called to cancel the new plan because @ATT rep lied because it wasn't free at all.
1. Spent hours on phone w/ @ATT reps. Sold a plan $10 cheaper than the one I had. I was paying $159 w/tax &amp;now it's $212. They say it's bcz it's a new plan but the old is always prepaid so y am I paying for both plus prorations? I had no intent to pay $43 more, instead $10 less.

Hi @AliVelshi love sugar high comment, keep it up. Be careful when u say top 1% is saving $51k bcz top .1% could be saving $50 Mil. Top 1% starts $389k. When averaging with the top .1% less distortion. Jeff Besos &amp; I are worth about $143B. If we average $71.5B each. @SRuhle
How is that low life dog in the White House doing with MS-13. Seems like people on Long Island think he's doing nothing. What has he ever accomplished besides cheating people or riding on Obama's better econ except w/Trickle Down he &amp; GOP will fall as usual bcz it doesn't work.
Symbiosis between DNC &amp;its voters. Ds have to lead their voters &amp;teach them what evil things Rs do and show true anger &amp; disgust for them, they don't.  D voters have to have their backs and they don't because they don't give them a reason. @TomPerez @chuckschumer @NancyPelosi

@JLownLaw A safety net doesn't make a socialistic state. Social Security doesn't make you a socialistic state because the government is only collecting money from the employee and employer. Not only that, they don't get out of it what they put in if they work 40-plus years at reasonable $

Wow @JRubinBlogger, what a change. U don't sound like a Republican anymore. I don't know if you're happy to hear that but u make a lot of sense w/o ugliness. I am curious what u think about the last 30 years of trickle down economics. Gave away big$ w/o any stimulous requirement
Sickened by hypocrisy of  @morningmika who loved Craig Melvin embarrassing Bill to publicly apologize to Monica, called Paul Ryan a great guy, had tears for a Ronald Reagan speech &amp; gleefully talked about NYTimes tough coverage of Hillary, like what, the one sided Wiki-Leaks BS?

@thegarance Unfortunately, they don't support their own gender &amp; they're almost as misogynistic as men.Many women r getting what they asked for. That's a shame. If many women don't think female politicians can be strong &amp;tough y would they think they'd be treated differently as journalists?
@SRuhle @AliVelshi. U r glorifying econ mired in debt, for which we got 0 but asset &amp;taxable income expatriation and an eroding middle class.		@JohnKasich Dems believe in stability, opportunity, fairness &amp;investment. You're just a trickle down a__hole like the rest of the GOP.
U r overhyping this econ, half in Asia,Ireland &amp; Isle of Jersey. Don't drool over the stock market as these r not American companies anymore as our middle class erodes w/part-time jobs at min wage &amp; no benefits. Remeber the Dow at 14000. How soon we forget! @SRuhle @AliVelshi

@BillKristol Bill I'm not wild about Republicans but I saw you this morning standing up where Santorum did not. I think trickle down economics was the worst thing that ever happened to our economy. It's the law of diminishing returns Rising. It's enough already don't you think?
All Floridians, this is a must-see debate and WPBF did an incredible job, considering there were five candidates in only an hour. We need more like honest and objective WPBF and less Sinclar Broadcasting Republican media whores. 		https://t.co/j2H0Uqzi0c
Ok, an apology is necessary because I looked everywhere but on your site. Good job now I'm going to post it here. It was a terrific debate especially considering it was only an hour and there were five candidates.
@WPBF25News I saw the 2018 Florida  Governor's Debate on Aug 2 and you guys did a great job, best debate. However, are you posting the link anywhere?  It's a credit to WPBF, get it out there! I just saw a commercial for that passed debate and for what, no link.  Get it out there!
To all Democratic Party Precinct leaders all across the USA, who use The Van, watch yr unregistered voters as we get closer to the election. U can select that in making a list. Print out a list now &amp;keep checking it.  If it jumps bc Rs are f****** with it, re-register them stat!

I love you both but when that CEO said Obama's GDP growth was 2.08% for fuck's sake you have to remove February 2009 to March 2010 of the Bush sustaining Avalanche and the sustaining effect of the Reagan-Bush Debt Service which pre-empts ability to stimulate. @SRuhle @AliVelshi
It's time U switch parties unless U R deplorable low lifes who support Trump. By the way, YOUR Trickle Down Economics is DESTROYING America. That &amp;evil things will be your legacy because you know better. @SenatorCollins @SenSasse @lisamurkowski @robportman @SenJohnKennedy
Everyone needs to call their moderate Republican elected officials to tell them it's time for them to switch parties and if they won't, we will take them down. Republican percentages of evil &amp; stupidity are rising but the GOP IS shrinking while the Democratic Party is growing.
There was a connection w/ @ninaturner from @BernieSanders to @DrJillStein that Sanders loved. He wanted Hillary to lose, that's an anarchists, then he wld have a shot at the presidency next time. If you have Turner/Sanders on I erase yr shows &amp;stop saving @jaketapper @ChrisCuomo
@LibrulAzzole @jaydesh7 @dihoppy @jimmy_dore Oh sure except Sanders was never possible and never got hit. Hillary didn't hit him because she didn't want to lose the children he lied to and Trump didn't hit him because he wanted him to cause trouble for Hillary. If he was the nominee he would have gotten demolished.
@jaydesh7 @dihoppy @jimmy_dore That's what you have to repeat? She gave authorization 2 threaten Iraq w/war so that Saddam Hussein would back down. He did back down, which was great but Bush double-crossed everybody &amp;went to war. That's not what anyone  wanted.  Learn to read.
@jaydesh7 @dihoppy @jimmy_dore So I'm the one that helped Donald Trump get into office not the idiots who bashed Hillary with lies? Is that what you're saying, Sanders liar &amp; NRA whore is a saint and Hillary was the devil. Maybe you want to look and see what you did in this last election. D's &amp; Rs r the same?
@jaydesh7 @dihoppy @jimmy_dore Typical stupid Bernie bro. You have no idea what you are talking about. And you believed all this crap that came from the Russian Bots and maybe you're one. &amp;U&amp; The Young Turks did a great job helping to get us Universal Health Care, minimum wage &amp;debt free education, good job
@jaydesh7 @dihoppy @jimmy_dore I think I'll pass up on these good wishes after hearing the way he tore apart Hillary with BS and lies. Wasn't real happy with Cenk either &amp; look at the good they did. Stupid Bernie Bros.
If your networks didn't read all WikiLeaks they would have had no effect. Remember, neither Trump's nor Sanders' campaign emails were played 4the world 2 C &amp;imagine what would have been in those emails that would have been disqualifying 4them. It's your  spotlight @ChrisCuomo
Many don't want a spotlight 4 @ninaturner who helped @berniesanders make kids think Hillary was evil like Trump then she appeared w/JillStein So I switch to Maddow, every1 shld, when u&amp;Tapper pull this s*** to F*** up another election. It's your  spotlight @ChrisCuomo diappointed

We would love to have u on our side!  U don't belong w/these Republicans anymore.  There are so many reasons like in 38 years trickle down didn't work bcz it went much 2far &amp; screwed the upper middle class, who pay a higher rate (+payroll tx) than hedge funders @RepCharlieDent
Russians didn't affect the election? What if they released all the emails of Trump's campaign team w/stuff he's hiding in his taxes, all his affairs, pussy grabbing, naked teenagers, all his bad &amp;illegal business dealings &amp;his plans to steal? They wanted their agent Trump to win.
Told u WE must teach the electorate abt how awful trickle down econ is &amp;we r still fighting the same battle for 38 f****** years. For the cost of the TCJA we could give a 100million families $1,500/yr for 10yrs which is better? @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @TomPerez @RepLoisFrankel
@amil_eoj @randyprine We lost by 60,000 votes in three states and James Comey had a lot to do with it and so did the FBI not spilling the beans about what kind of piece of s*** Trump is when it comes to being a Russian double agent &amp; wikileaks.

Hey @SRuhle great job attacking Kudlow's lies &amp; the bullshit his friends used to confuse us.  He said the deficit was going down fast. Unreal only thing that could affect that are very temporary repatriation proceeds. What a world we live in now.
Can anyone explain y Trickle Down Economics haS been dreadful 4all but billionaires? Giving every US family $1,250/year for 10yrs &amp;force back 700 inverted companies wld cost much less or 0 than the Trump tax cuts, bcz it wld bring much more tax revenue, create jobs &amp;infuse $ HERE

@The_Borg_Queen_ May he rot in he'll with Nader and Sarandon and Stein et. al.
5 of 4 They allowed them to bring back $ &amp;only tax that at 14% payable in 8 years &amp;no conditions, schmucks, like adding jobs or capital investment here. So they brought back enough to pay dividends &amp;buyback their own corp stock &amp;even tho they're in the DOW they're not American
4 of 4 are getting campaign contributions not too. There are 700 + of these inverted countries &amp; we need to pass a law that says this has 2B fixed retroactively or they are prohibited to sell here &amp;there officers will be arrest here. Instead Trump cuts the tax rate from 35 to 21%
3 of 4 the 50% is arbitrary but it is similar to what the estate tax was and this is like a death when assets or passed to another generation except this is much much worse bcz they're leaving the country by a sneaky trick. GOP never wants to fix this bcz their whores are....
2 of 4 Sales to the rest of the world aren't taxed at all to the US no matter what. During the time Apple was here it built a huge company with very large assets, thanks to US services &amp; research &amp;by transferring those assets to Ireland there should be an expat tax 50% on value
1 of 4 Just so you understand what inversion does, a company like Apple puts a desk and a phone in Dublin and stops paying tax to the USA on any income for all US sales from Dublin.That's for sales to the USA &amp; worldwide. If any money from those sales comes back here, it's taxed.
Question u must ask is what did Trump do to bring back 700 companies that inverted, left us for tax purposes, &amp;R being taxed or not in Ireland,  Caymans, Cypress Etc. Fellating these corps  doesn't bring them back, laws do. What useless trash Republicans are too whorish 2fix this

The Trump Administration associates anything it doesn't want with MS-13. They do bad things like rape, extortion, kidnapping, pedophilia, blackmail etc.  They looked at Trumps resume, knowing Putin has even more on Trump, so MS-13 sent him an application. He's as evil as them.

7. @TomSteyer @TomPerez voters need to understand that tax rates used to be 87% &amp; W brought them down to 15% &amp; now they're about 20% for the wealthiest Americans while many and upper-middle-class Americans pay 39.6% + 15.3% SE tax. How can we not explain this to them? Malfeasance
6. @TomSteyer @TomPerez voters need to understand that not only is social security not an entitlement but it's almost 99% funded by the middle class including some of Social Security welfare aspects that should be picked up by the general fund not only by blue collar workers.
5. @TomSteyer @TomPerez ppl need to understand what the economic multiplier is &amp; why it's much better to give a million families $1,000 than to give one billionaire another billion dollars in  tax relief that he will spend in Asia, the Caymans, Isle of Jersey or Monte Carlo.
4. @TomSteyer @TomPerez it is disgraceful I have to tell you this but you're doing nothing. If you make people understand what's going on they will be angry with the Republicans and they will give Democrats cover for attacking Republicans. Meanwhile we are doing nothing.

2. @TomSteyer @TomPerez the electorate needs to know how this last text bill does nothing to grow our econ other than a quick blip like Bush had b4 the Avalanche came. There are no conditions for giving billionaires more billions, no job increases&amp;no add't capital spent here.
1. @TomSteyer @TomPerez did you see 60 Minutes last night? We need to target voters on social media who don't know WTF is going on with our economy and their futures. They're entertained by Trump and GOP but we need to bring facts about how trickle down economics has screwed them
@TomSteyer if you want to get involved with us, please speak to Terrie Rizzo who is the Chair of the Florida Democratic Party, as well as the Palm Beach County DEC. We have some very important ideas that the DNC is ignoring plus our messages are a hedge on the impeachment effort.
@TomSteyer We need to teach the electorate which will in turn embolden Dem politicians to fight GOP lies &amp; expose them and show disgust for them and even challenge the media to understand financial matters. After all we've seen, nothing else matters, not even kids in cages.

@TomSteyer Electorate has no concept of tax rate history and no concept of the economic multiplier. They don't understand the difference between giving a billionaire and extra billion dollars and to give a million families an extra $1,000. We are still fighting trickle-down econ.

Everyone, u have 2contact yr county DemParty, 		1. Get voters to do absentee ballots		2. Insist on an audit Trails via some kind of tape for ANY voting system.		3. Get people web addresses so they can check online that they're registered properly w/correct address B4 election Day

@dinafink Totally true. When you piss and whine about somebody non-stop and the press covers every time you do it, eventually imbeciles believe it and love it. And, the Republican party is filled with selfish imbeciles. VJ is great &amp; classier than anyone in Hump' s cabinet.
@NoGOPNo The GOP is designed for scumbags &amp; the most selfish people on the planet. They don't have consciences yes God left them out of all Republicans. So they gathered together in this party where they're all the same evil MFers. Maybe they should look for The Wizard of Oz

@SenSanders Thank u for how u helped the middle class get no increase in min wage, no healthcare &amp;no education costs. U R so arrogant &amp;such a liar &amp;u lied to children who didn't know any better &amp;who voted for $tein or didn't vote at all. U told everyone Dems rigged the system. U disgust me.

@chuckwoolery Much ado about nothing especially for supporters of trump who has not  divested himself from his businesses and in fact messes with the emoluments clause every single day. Stupid Hypocrites!		https://t.co/WuiRh4Wuuj
@chuckwoolery Clintons gave $10M to CGI last year, how much did Trump give the Trump Foundation which is used to bribe State's attorney generals like Pam Bondi Florida so as not to prosecute him. Joule? Any reputable news report on this? Maybe it was Tony Podesta brother,  who has some trouble
@chuckwoolery Money given to the Clinton Foundation to help fight AIDS, malaria, hunger all over the world is not the same thing as bribing a president for access, to pay off women with whom he had affairs. Trump is a grifter who wants to get paid for any decision he makes.
@krassenstein West Virginians have 2fight 4 their livelihoods but the reason we can't retrain them is bcz the Republicans have drained the Treasury by tax cuts &amp;even took 3 trillion dollars from the Social Security trust fund. Irony is ppl from WV helped them steal to give $ to  billionaires.

@nickconfessore Nick, better still, how are u all doing with the bullshit &amp;lies about the economy thanks to these stupid tax cuts. As is we have a fixed debt increase of $1T per year. Remember Sept 2008? $ coming back only to but back stock &amp;pay dividends. Y can't u explain this to Americans?
@nickconfessore Evidence of Criminal Activity, conspiracy w/our enemy, money laundering, pedophile behavior, sexual assault yeah, I loved Hillary but I'd want to know about that.  The emails were same as 2 prior SOS &amp; Bush White House. Nothing was in there just fake news, Comet said 0 classified
@Plantflowes @nickconfessore Then he blames Dems 4causing a rigged system. Wasn't it just precious how $12 minimum wage was not good enough, he wanted $18. That's an easy way to sell yourself out of an election. Yes we all want and $18 minimum wage but you can't more than double the one  we have.
@nickconfessore @BernieSanders was an NRA whore who voted against Brady 5x &amp;against liability 4gun mfg &amp;stores &amp;lied abt costs. He never criticized Jill Stein, never once complimented Hillary, just said don't vote for Trump. However he complimented Sarandon&amp;Dawson. Whatever they did wasn't enuf
@nickconfessore For those of us who realized it wasn't imbalance the WikiLeaks with no big deal. But you know how stupid the electorate is and they don't figure in these things. It's like a referee becoming more important than the players in a basketball game. It was a very large disservice.
@nickconfessore Nick, problem is when u only have stolen emails from 1 side towards the very end of the election, U become a tool of that person's enemy &amp;u encourage it. Imagine what would have happened if internal emails we're exposed from Trump's staff or even Sanders'. U created an imbalance.
U pushed out a Giant in the Senate who did nothing wrong so u&amp; @BernieSanders cld GRATUITOUSLY damage a real leader in the Dem Party. FY Everyone, give $ to her Democratic opponent &amp; get rid of her. Get rid of Sanders whores, Stein, Sanadon, Dawson, Turner, Ellison &amp; Gillibrand. https://t.co/LKlOcF3cuG

That was hard to watch @ChrisCuomo You have to stop letting MotorMouth make unrestricted claims about how well the economy is doing which was a continuation of Obama's.  The Bush economy started the same way after his tax cuts and AVALANCHED, as did Hoover's and Reagan's

@Timbaxter1 after being a Samsung Note user since December 2012, with the incompetence you show as Pres of @SamsungUS, I would tell everyone to run away from your company &amp; go to Apple. You had my phone 5 times &amp; never fixed it right, just made it worse each time it came back
@Timbaxter1  Your awful Plano service couldn't even glue back the display panel of my Note 4 after Sharhonda Hughes was making sure they would, among other things. Since you won't personally take responsibility to fix my phone for trip #6 or send a new 1, can u send me glue AWFUL

@SamsungMobileUS Hey PREZ  @Timbaxter1 after my phone came back frm yr repair in Plano TX 3X cld not send reply emails, the display panel came back loose 2x &amp;unsecured so dirt &amp;water can get in &amp;effect dictation, Ms Hud told them. Don't press down hard dictation doesn't work. What R U going 2do?
@SamsungMobileUS My Note 4 was sent back to me  from your Plano TX repair facility 3X &amp; each time it couldn't reply to emails, verified by AT&amp;T tech, &amp; 2X w/the display panel not seated and lifts up. Is that your robots screwing up or design flaws. President @Timbaxter1 you need to fix this.
@SamsungMobileUS My Note 4 email has been reimagined, i can't reply to anything, Lo and behold dictation only works sometimes and not now. This is after my phone was sent and came back from Samsung's repair in Plano TX 5 times. They consIder no replying fine. @Timbaxter1 president of  @SamsungUS
So @Timbaxter1, since you could not fix my phone after 3 times I  sent it to Plano, not counting the time you sent it back bcz yr battery erased The ID. Are you sending me a new phone or you're done with yr responsibility? Samsung created the problems for God's sake.
Liberals have been trying to be nice to Republicans for 38 years &amp; it doesn't work. They R stupid &amp;evil &amp;we must expose how they R hurting people.  Being nice invigorates them to pounce. They need to have the truth slap their faces hard by ppl who love doing it.  @amychua
@SamsungMobile Your motto; do what you can't.  After receiving my Note 4 from yr Plano TX repair 5 times, I can't reply to emails see pic, can't keep display panel from popping up leaving it exposed to water &amp;most of all I can't believe how bad Samsung has become, telling me my phone is fine. https://t.co/ILEcEYSsOc
@SamsungMobileUS Is that so? So how come u sent me back a phone, 3 effing times from yr Plano TX repair facility, that cannot reply to emails &amp; whose display panel is not glued in and lifts up so that air and water can get in, after being warned, like you let your phones explode? 💣 @Timbaxter1
Don't be fooled. Putin probably gavee his Manchurian Cabdidate the list of those to expell to keep them out of the reach of Mueller @SRuhle  @AliVelshi
@_pascuzzo @Timbaxter1 @SamsungUS I wonder if Samsung is. Don't get how they didn't know these batteries were getting hot bcz they were swelling on Notes 2&amp;4 &amp;were being thrown away bcz ppl saw them &amp;felt them.  Who doesn't know heat &amp;computers are bad thing? Samsung probably didn't read forums I complained there
@_pascuzzo @Timbaxter1 @SamsungUS So then crazy things were happening with emails and everything got slow. Then I realized that the heat prpbably affected the motherboard and memory locations and things stopped working. Samsung has the entire record on here. Check it out @Timbaxter1 press of @SamsungUS
@_pascuzzo @Timbaxter1 If they were permanent batteries they would have exploded in a tight case. It got to the point where I couldn't put the plate on so I had to throw them out. How could @SamsungUS  been so clueless @Timbaxter1 ? The back plate had little teats that would catch but they broke off
@_pascuzzo @Timbaxter1 Sent it back bcz the display panel was black &amp; they couldn't read  imei#. I had to get AT&amp;T verify the phone &amp;send it back again, this was during the hurricane in FL &amp; told them,  they didn't care. Galaxy Note4  has replaceable batteries so they never blew up bcz I threw them out
@_pascuzzo @Timbaxter1 1 of the prob was the phone slips into locatation services &amp;heats up the phone like crazy. I feel heat in my pants pocket. That heat melted the the ink on ID tag inside the phone &amp;the battery expanded &amp;bellied &amp;that erased the printing. Those SOBs in Plano blamed me &amp;sent it back
@_pascuzzo @Timbaxter1 They sent back a phone 3X that can't reply to emails, it gets hung up in a loading msg screen &amp;never comes out.. So, I can't reply!  Plus the display panel is not connected an lifts up &amp; they were warned &amp; did nothing JERKS @Timbaxter1 Batteries swelled &amp;heat destroyed my phone
Look at how my phone was returned to me from your facility Plano TX @Timbaxter1 pres of @sumsungUS after they were warned by me in a note and by Sharhonda Hughes, yet they and you say the phone was returned without any service, just your tests on a factory reset and wiped phone. https://t.co/5OIsgr6Mha
Waiting for a resolution. I don't have to pay a $1,000 every few years for a phone, and get service like this. You need to take some responsibility for this because right now it's on Sharonda Hughes, which she deserves but these problems come from design flaws. @Timbaxter1
Do u at Samsumg think u can not take responsibity for your design flaws and give customers excessive aggravation and arrogance as Plano did to me when they blamed me for their heat problems. @Timbaxter1 ? Let's not forget your Note 7 exploded and get extremely hot &amp; self destruct
So, the same heat that melted the ink on your id ticket, ruined mem locations &amp;why I cannot reply to emails. POOR DESIGN How can u turn you back on customers by not fixing a phone or replacing it. R u inept in business? That is the image big Samsung wants? @Timbaxter1  REPLACE IT
My Samsung Note 4 is back from Plano 5 days for 5th time &amp;look that yr hot battery began 2melt, smear &amp;erase ink, which Plano blamed me for. Heat is why my phone went bad  design fault &amp;u should have replaced it or everything in it bcz there is damage not seen.  @Timbaxter1 https://t.co/VXptpNZHhV
@SamsungSupport Seems as though your president of @SamsungUS  @Timbaxter1 and his assistant Sharhonda Hughes believe that a Samsung phone that cannot REPLY to emails is considered in good working order. WTF? I cannot reply to emails. Can you on your phone? Who can't?  Never buy anything Samsung.
@SamsungSupport Idiots at yr Plano repair accused me of ruining the ID sticker inside the Note 4 but Samsung let their phones get so hot, heat melted the ink &amp;ultimately erased it. U R the company with exploding phones, Note 7. Now they say it's fine for a phone not 2B able 2Reply 2emails WTF
How wld u like it if u had a Samsung phone that came back from repair Plano TX 5X &amp; couldn't reply to emails 3X &amp; whose display panel was separating from the phone 2X. Would u buy another Samsung phone when u know battery heat caused these problems + exploding phones?@Timbaxter1
One more thing, in Feb 2018 Plano sent me the phone with the display panel not glued and easily moving up and down, I told that to Ms. Hughes &amp; it came back the same way in March. Who can trust Samsung? @Timbaxter1 Sickening! https://t.co/ZaMMexkgOV
U had my phone in Aug, Sept, Dec 2017 &amp; Feb &amp;Mar of 2018 &amp; it still doesn't work properly. Read all comments. I believe it happened bcz Samsung wasn't controlling heat from expanding and exploding batteries. I have no more time for this. @TimBaxter1. Sent back unglued display 2X
Hi @TimBaxter1 of @SamsungUS. Please take a look at the fiasco of Ticket # 4146926213 et al being handled by Sharhonda Hughes who believes that a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 that cannot reply to emails, after being at your Plano facility 5x is considered in fine working order. Pathetic
Screw you @BernieSanders! You &amp; your God damned Our Revolution Group praised @Susansarandon &amp; @rosariodawson	&amp; never took down @DrJillStein. Where are your taxes? Hiding something?		Sanders tells Democrats to back off primary attacks | WTOP https://t.co/3esAYVqTB5 via @WTOP
@roz233 @SenSanders Roz, unfortunately, people who vote for Republicans and those imbeciles, many of whom I lost as friends on Twitter, who followed Sanders to Stein or not to vote at all, opened the door to fascism and lies, incredible lies.  We can only wonder what stupid things they do next time.
We should arm selected Senators &amp; Representatives &amp; allow AR-15s in the halls of Congress &amp;in State Houses so those SOBs, including NRA Princess whore @SenSanders, who still can't find his tax returns, can learn what it's like to fear &amp;run from active shooters with machine guns.
How many students were killed by video games? Trump's macho a**hole NRA loving  supporters should buy an Xbox One X or a PlayStation 4 instead of an AR-15.  DEPLORABLES. Electronic Arts is not the problem, Bushmaster, Colt and Smith &amp; Wesson are the problems.

@cdelbrocco If you look closely Cheri, every Republican is an asshole. That is how the Republican Party exists and that's why they find it their home. I'm talking about politicians and those who vote for them or they are just plain piss-poor stupid.
@brantfisch @rebeccastern @Twitter What a thrill for Marjorie and Hal and the rest of the family.
Don't like Apple but incompetence by @SamsungMobileUS is 2steep to climb. I've had to send the phone to them four times, that means we doing it 4 times when it comes back come and getting new tempered glass screen protector and aggravation. If they can't fix minei want a new one
I sent my Samsung Note 4 to @SamsungMobileUS 4 times because their phones heat up, blow up batteries and ruin things. I cannot REPLY to an email. I get this screen till the battery dies forever yet their service tells me my phone is fine. Three times and they don't do anything. https://t.co/91jTjFBIME

@BarackObama @davidhogg111 Well said. Kids R now 2smart 2follow NRA whore  @BernieSanders who voted against BradyBill 5x &amp;against liability for gun stores &amp;manufacturers. NRA only wants more gun sales esp. expensive AR-15s. Kids all over coordinate w/ County Democratic DECs. REPUBS WILL DO SH*T FOR YOU!
It's all about money and gun sales. SELL THOSE AR-15s &amp; and use the second amendment so the deplorables can think they're patriotic, while these assholes watch their kids die.
Posturing abt what makes the NRA tick is all bulshit. NRA has one thing in mind &amp;that is GUN SALES, the more the better &amp;the higher the income for the gun manufacturers. They don't care about safety or kids, that's not what NRA&amp;GOP whores are getting paid for. Unelect all of them
All of you, especially students, U C how the Repubs work &amp;don't care. U need to learn abt all issues. Contact your county Democratic Party (DEC) &amp; they will get you the info you need &amp;find ppl to help u understand enough of the facts to win debates against lying BS Republicans.
@BrindaStar People r stupid &amp;want fast answers. Biden had no real responsibilities w/ Obama.He smiled a lot but put him in front of a camera under pressure, he can be &amp;has been a complete schmuck. He shld never be POTUS candidate  for our party &amp;yes he f***** up with Thomas and Anita Hill.
Life changes.We don't put the family in a horse &amp; buggy anymore, we play Madden instead of Electric Football. We don't have to hunt for food bcz for $4.99 we can get a roast chicken at Costco, less than the price of bullets. It's time we kick out ALL GOP pigs &amp; whores NOW!
.@chucktodd if it was yr kids who were shot in their schools, wld u have been such a mamby pamby asshole w/@SenatorLankford saying AR-15s still shld be sold &amp; w/ @BernieSanders lying abt his allegiance to the NRA so they wouldn't run against him? NBC, I'm calling bullshit on you.
Take a kid from Parkland, let her  host Meet The Press, she'd be far superior to @chucktodd. @SenatorLankford says AR-15 should be sold &amp;Todd is silent. @BernieSanders  says he against NRA but he voted against Brady 5 times &amp; against Liability Todd, silent. @SRuhle @AliVelshi
Apple phones don't have heating problems that @SamsungMobileUS Notes have. The Note 7 exploded and my Notes 2 and 4 heated up so much that batteries expanded &amp; ruined things in the phone. @SamsungSupport wants me to send it back a 4th time. I want them to replace the phone.
After this mass casualty tragedy in Parkland, FL &amp; your romance w/the NRA &amp; bcz u never submitted your tax returns giving Trump cover &amp;4 the lies u told gullible children @BernieSanders I hope you rot in hell. @TomPerez please leave the DNC @HillaryClinton u were great.

I totally agree with you Jane and I believe that was the reason why he didn't want anyone to see his taxes, because he has no money and that's why he ran for president because he's broke but for Putin. Putin coerced him to run. https://t.co/vpx0TLQ1Nw
If there was a God he would give @Jim_Jordan of Ohio two heads so that they could lie each other to death. Would be great if @HillaryClinton could go after House Repubs, w/her emails &amp;they be foced to give up their immunity from malicious prosecution &amp;malfeasance.

@NancyPelosi @dwstweets @DarrenSoto @sr_simone @SethHanlon today u never had a chance 2explain how overwhelming  pass-through reduction in tax from 39.6 to 20% will be. U did not explain inversion or sovereign rights to tax here &amp;how econ multiplier dicredits Trickle Down

@TAPSTRIMEDIA Totally agree, I wrote something very similar.
Now Trump blames Dems for immigrants killing Americans. When do we indict Repubs &amp;other NRA WHORES like @BernieSanders for the murder of thousands of Americans by voting AGAINST the Brady Bill &amp; AGAINST giving liability to gun manufacturers &amp; gun stores for their malfeaseance?
Any person in the news who gives Trump any credit for the economy WHEN HE DID NOTHING FOR IT &amp; IT SLUMPED COMPARED TO OBAMA'S PERFORMANCE is a fkg idiot. @chucktodd @jaketapper @GStephanopoulos Tell them @SRuhle &amp; @AliVelshi 5 Million jobs lost in 2009 belonged to Bush.

Oy, @SRuhle I love u &amp; @AliVelshi  but that interview w/liar Jill Stein, u misinformed already stupid electorate by giving her a pass. She told kids banks didn't have to pay back TARP $ so they shouldn't have to pay back their school loans. A mother on fire, I can pray for that.

@darthstar99 @ilovemymanalot @chucktodd @SRuhle @AliVelshi Tim Russert never impressed me when interviewing Rs unless they were so compromised, the stupid boys on Friends could have done it. He never followed up &amp; coined, "If both sides are mad, I'm doing something right. So, R's were always mad &amp; played him like a fiddle. @chucktodd
@ilovemymanalot @darthstar99 @chucktodd Tim Russert was AWFUL. He allowed Cheney &amp;Rice, in lying abt WMDs tp piss all over him  I saw Pete Wilson of CA tear him apart bcz Russet was afraid of him &amp; all R's threatening not to come back. He set the whimp standard for @chucktodd 2follow. Bring  @SRuhle &amp; @AliVelshi to MTP
Is there a more useless econ&amp;tax interviewer than @chucktodd. Marc Short said lowering corp tax will bring back jobs, Americans are hearing this, so y didn't Todd say how are those jobs coming back when corps are paying $1/hr in Asia. MTP needs better or add someone else.
What kind of an asshole r u going 2feel like @TomPerez when @BernieSanders runs against the Democrat again. @SenSchumer &amp; @NancyPelosi get rid of Perez &amp; replace him w/ @GovHowardDean before it's too late. Sanders will f**k us again and this time it will be your fault.
@Maxeightyeight @JeffFlake @BobCorker @SenatorCollins @SenJohnMcCain @marcorubio @robportman @SenRonJohnson It gets lumped in with the national debt &amp;when debt goes up to $37T that means interest is $1.9Trln at 5% and $1.1Trln at 3% every year, more than defense. Repubs will look to cut SS &amp;Medicare&amp;Medicaid after dropping top tax bracket from 87% to 20% #URGF **KED
@JeffFlake @BobCorker @SenatorCollins @SenJohnMcCain @marcorubio @robportman @SenRonJohnson will cut Corp tax from 35-21% w/o one additional job here, pay $1/hr in Asia, don't have to move taxable HQs back here, can invest tax savings in Asia &amp; no increase in min wage #URGF**KD

Plus, with pass thrus they avoid  payroll &amp;instead have pass thru inc taxed as profit they r not paying Medicare, with no top limit, they are hurting the SS/Medicare Trust fund by not putting any $ into it and that will also add to the debt @SRuhle @AliVelshi
Taxable inc over $418,000 &amp; $470,000, S &amp; MFJ pays 38 6%. W/pass thrus they can have their corps paid, take deductions, pay no SS or Medicare &amp;B taxed at 20%. This helps upper middle class but it's a huge blowjob to those earning in the 10s 100s of millions. @SRuhle @AliVelshi
Plus, the baseline debt will grow $1Trillion per year if we do nothing! The debt will be $37 Trillion in 10 years @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @TomPerez You should be screaming. @SRuhle @AliVelshi @chucktodd @jaketapper @GStephanopoulos @wolfblitzer WakeTFup!

America, learn what sincerity looks like. Look them in eyes &amp; think what kind of person this is.  Stop voting for people who use the bible to hide their evil.

@JohnJHarwood In addition to the baseline trillion per year increase due 2 interest on the debt thanks to GOP tax cuts. So by 2027 the debt will be $35 Trillion. At 5% interest that is $1 75 Trillion per year, double the defense budget &amp;4 relatively no stimulus. No more tax cuts for wealthy
U need to separate from @berniesanders &amp; @ninaturner  @allinwithchris Hayes @maddow until they provide their 2015 and 2016 tax returns to see if they're just selfish paid sabateur rats like @RalphNader. Stop interviewing them abt the Dems, they're anarchists &amp; liars not Dems.
I'm seeing too much @BernieSanders talking abt the Dems w/ @chucktodd @jaketapper @GStephanopoulos when he's not even a Dem, rather a sabateur rat like @RalphNader. Do not put him or @ninaturner  on your shows until he releases his 2015 and 2016 tax returns or you're the a**holes
Dear @SenFranken everyone I now, except 4 @berniesanders assholes who voted 4 Stein, wrote in his name or didn't vote, is angry &amp;wants you to take back your resignation. Your leaving is killing moral in the real Democratic Party, please don't go. We can't let Sanders destroy us.

Listen, correct me If I'm wrong @AliVelshi, Sen @robportman 's econ&amp;tax advisor said baseline deficit will be $1 Trl annually or $10 Trl more debt in 10 years plus $1.5 Trl or more from  massive tax cut. Debt will be at least $37Trl in 10 years. Interest $1Trln/year at 5%, $1.8T
@shannonrwatts @5280high We need more of that plain language by the media As Trump attacks them. He should be called a lying piece of shit or at least a liar. Franklin Graham, what a waste of chemicals he is. His father was a whore and charlatan too, for Nixon.
ILLEGAL FOREIGN PRICING is where a Corp here sells finished goods to no tax foreign subsidiaries at no profit, or even a loss to carry back against prior paid tax. Sub then sells items &amp; has big profits that are never taxed. @SRuhle @AliVelshi Big effing loophole.
Wow, @SRuhle &amp; @AliVelshi great journalism/interview w/Rep Chris Stewart of Utah. Corp tax requires no new jobs, not coming back to USA or prohibits foreign infrastructure &amp; equipment investment. Also, check into ILLEGAL FOREIGN PRICING to shift profits to foreign subs.
To @BernieSanders lemmings who thought Goldman Sachs &amp; Hillary hovered in Dante's lower circles of hell and didn't see the real evil as Sanders, Sarandon, Stein &amp;Trump you are responsible for destroying all the good America had bcz of yr blind arrogance.	https://t.co/3cTFY5odWu
@actblue I gave $25 to Doug Jones through you and you have charged me another 5 times at least. I want a refund immediately for all but that first $25. Follow me so I can give you more information and do it now!
Can't sit back &amp;wait 4Mueller while Repubs r pissing on all of us. Every Dem shld show anger &amp; fury at GOP WHORE colleagues as they r making u look pathetic. Pre-empt America abt a small bump &amp;then the shit will hit the fan, debt&amp;interest soars @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @TomPerez
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @TomPerez @SenatorCollins @SenBobCorker @JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain @RonJohnsonWI @lisamurkowski Republicans created $24 Trillion in debt with Reagan &amp; Bush tax cuts, so who among you thinks Trickle Down works? SPEAK UP! They will double the debt to $50 trillion &amp; then we're totally F**KED. $1.5 trillion will become $10 or $20 trillion. That's what Republicans do. WAKE UP!
Billionaire 20% carried interest 20% tax rate stays &amp; cut Corp tax by 37.5% from 35% to 20% w/o requiring &amp;linking:		1. Substantial job incr	2. Paying tax on ALL income to USA w/credit for foreign tax paid.	3. no investments on foreign infrastructure and equip https://t.co/nteBvNquCC

WTF is wrong w/u @jaketapper constantly putting on the MOLES in the Democratic Party for the 2016 election, @BernieSanders  &amp; @ninaturner who know nothing about taxes or anything,  on a show abt taxes?  Trying to f**k up another election?
Good person 2follow &amp;believe, huh? She must be exposed, boycotted and blackballed until the kids spit on her. How many more elections are we going to let @susansaradon screw up?  &amp; @berniesanders praised her in his book. Screw him!		https://t.co/2c8nGdMjRz
@GlumBird @PaulAnthony1979 @MateCosido @BernieSanders Are you nuts? Putin, Stalin and Castro were anti fascist?
@PaulAnthony1979 @GlumBird @MateCosido Wow, the future is waiting 4 us 2 B like Cuba &amp; Venezuela, two of the most repressive countries in the world. Everyone listened to the Castros, didn't matter what democracy looked and Venezuela &amp; its socialist tore the country apart. @BernieSanders FOOLS go the hell away NOW!
@BarackObama Happy Thanksgiving to U &amp; yr gorgeous &amp; precious family. Help make that transformation &amp; teach, so yr daughters &amp; my kids don't have to have their lives governed by the likes of Trump, Moore, Barton etc. I try to get to @chuckschumer @NancyPelosi &amp; @TomPerez,  but I'm not YOU.
@BarackObama I watched entire 49min Reno Gazette interview. U talked abt Reagan being a transformative pres &amp; BC &amp; W were not. Were you? You were historic but u cld've been transformative. U weren't but u still can make that diff by helping voters know what they're voting for. We need u now!
@BarackObama Mr. Pres, u can do something 4us all, reason I thought yr presidency w/b great, is 2teach voters what they don't know about inversion, trickle down, econ multiplier &amp; tax history &amp; philosophy &amp; get the DNC 2do more of that. We need informed voters. We're u the change we needed?
Since u still have gullible young followers, @BernieSanders  release your 2016 taxes so we can see if u were paid by the GOP, NRA or Russians to lie about Democrats &amp; push your rigged system Bullshit. @RalphNader  should have 2. You both sicken me for telling kids Ds &amp; Rs r same
What does it take to see how stupid &amp; gullible people can be. Was this a prophecy?  This episode of Trackdown shows us that Americans have not evolved and we are as stupid and lazy as ever to elect and con man and thief like Trump. #Alabama pay attention.		https://t.co/SRmVT66HoN
People of #Alabama u r great &amp;it's time u stop being victimized by charlatan preachers &amp;lying hypocritical Republican politicians. They laugh all the way to the bank as they whore for billionaires, who do not invest in the US. They want u ignorant abt econ &amp; tax WE CAN TEACH YOU
@jaketapper @BillinPortland @ABC @NBCNews @CBSNews @FoxNewsSunday @CNN @CNNSotu @BernieSanders @RepRobinKelly @neeratanden Your favorite guests @BernieSanders  &amp; @ninaturner worked harder for the Republicans than they did for the Democrats, why are they still on your show, to cause more trouble?
Faith based author from my NY HS said can't be Trump-Russia connection if they couldn't find it in a year. THEY FOUND IT! Then he said it would take 10 minutes of a good investigation to find a Clinton-Russia collusion. GOD PROTECT US FROM THOSE WHO SAY U SPEAK TO THEM. #Alabama
Unless u r an #Alabama billionaire, Republicans, Trump &amp; their tax bills do nothing 4 U or  me. Unless u r a sexual predator like Moore &amp; Trump, religious phonies do nothing 4 U or me. Seriously, know who really cares about you &amp; your families. Wake up, Repubs don't care at all
@SenSherrodBrown @MichiganDeb1 Takes away alimony deduction which will screw non-property spouses &amp;kids who'd get more $ for families if the property spouses would get a deduction. As a matrimonial professional, we've been doing that for decades, called Lesterizing. Republicans &amp;OrinHatch are selfish assholes.
@chucktodd And of course, Todd said nothing.
Amazing we complain abt Mafia when these Repubs R thieves like u can't imagine. This tax bill is a theft from the US Treas just like Bush&amp;Reagan did.Last night on @chucktodd Sh*t4Brains R Sen said Bush tax cuts were great stim to 2008. #Avalanche2follow		https://t.co/Rjmjij0vbp
#Alabama, for event planners, will be a wasteland to stay away from &amp;maybe for football players, especially African Americans. #BLM stay away from #Alabama w/racist predators running that state &amp; Sh*tForBrains voting, let's see how they do with Moore. Rise up Alabama #RollTide
Roy Moore is not only making a joke of #Alabama he's bringing out the hypocrisy of the evangelicals &amp;their grifter phony pastors they follow. Moore is banned from malls for a reason. Wake Up #Alabama or you'll be seeing, ROLL SH*T FOR BRAINS
@Craniguy #Alabama evangelicals, do u really think Christ would endorse what Trump &amp; Moore do? Have you lost the concept of right and wrong? Roy Moore is forbidden to go into malls in Alabama &amp;you want to put that animal in the Senate what about your children what about your grandchildren
@Espngreeny @espngolic You know,  the product of you two may be greater than the sum of your parts.  If so, maybe you'll be back. I missed #ChrisCarter too. You'll be fine, both of you,  you're too good not to be.  Maybe come back together.
@Espngreeny @espngolic change sucks. I loved u both  4different things but mostly 4your friendship. I hated it when there were fill-ins. I hope u stay friends forever, that will make us all happy. Tell Jr to smile more &amp;Verk to speak slower. U made us happy! Now, MSNBC &amp;Drumpf
TY to 2idiots who vote 4Repubs &amp;Drumpf &amp;special TY 2jerks who voted 4 @DrJillStein or never voted at all. U all made this happen, HHS Sec'y from Eli Lilly.  When will drug prices come down? Never.  	https://t.co/zX9Lw0OJtP
@Espngreeny @espngolic Oh my, I thought you were going on vacation, not ending it. You're my haven from Trump. Can't you take him with you? Mornings won't be the same without you guys.
@eclecticbrotha @jca10c9 BS claims 2B a progressive yet he whored 4NRA, gun manufacturers &amp;gun stores, didn't supply taxes giving Trump cover never a good word about Hillary or bad words about Stein, Sarandon, Dawson, Turner. Instead he praised them. A true asshole nebish who hid behind independence.
@mrbabypants Everything @SenSanders did helped Donald Trump incl not producing taxes which gave Trump cover. Sanders also lied like Trump &amp;promising things that were impossible. Sanders told kids Dems rigged the system. That SOB needs to be kicked the hell out of democratic politics forever.
Aren't many GOP Senate seats in play in 2018 but there were in 2016 &amp;thanks to anarchist @BernieSanders lying&amp;shitting on Dems, many kids voted for Jill Stein or didn't vote &amp;we lost our chance to take back the Senate.Did he have a bad word about Stein, Turner, Sarandon? Bastard
Those who voted for Trump and Stein, those who never voted and those who followed @BernieSanders and took us into hell. That's as stupid as we can be. https://t.co/Nqj5EkVcgP
@secupp @randyprine Thought I wrote this but this friend has to rationalize Y he voted for Trump so he told me that Trump never lied to him as a public official. A moronic thing to say. After the election he said Trump won the most counties by far. This is what Republicans have to do to justify
@secupp @randyprine To justify how shallow they are. Seriously, trickle down economics again? Wasn't bad enough for Hoover, Reagan and Bush. Only time it works is when there's a shortage of capital, in case you and your friends didn't know. It's blow jobs for billionaires.
@keithellison @tildology Keith, with liar @BernieSanders pulling your strings &amp; u giving credibility to @donnabrazile f*** you and u need to leave the DNC. Hear that  @TomPerez , get rid of those lying MFers or they will screw us again.
Turnout was so awful last Nov, thank you @SenSanders for convincing young children that voting was useless. PIG! @SenSchumer take him the hell out of leadership and then expose what a lying whore he is. Show some backbone if you want ppl to vote Democratic.
@secupp @randyprine You know you're young but have you heard the things Ronald Reagan said about liberals? He was vicious and relentless. Fact is Republicans f***-up everything they touch starting with Hoover and his trickle down tax cuts to 24%. A conscience isn't a big thing in Republican circles
@secupp @randyprine For this last election he had to rationalize voting for Trump by saying, as a public official he never lied to him. His mind was always working on BS right do you know Trump overwhelmingly one more counties than Hillary. A total nonsense statistic. But you don't like stereotypes
@secupp @randyprine S.E., 1 of my best friends growing up in Jr High  was a conservative &amp;always seemed 2find reasons 2put down ppl who couldn't excel  actually blame them for not finding jobs when there were none as if they should have created them &amp;billionaires got huge tax cuts to create them...
RT @JonahNRO: As the father of a 14 year old girl, this “What’s the big deal?” crap enrages me.
#Alabama I'm a Florida but NY all my life, it's not where we r but who we r. World's changing &amp;the Republicans r not looking out 4 U or your kids unless yr loaded &amp; not on Southern Comfort. Love&amp;Protect your kids vote for Doug Jones not that evil maniac. You're better than him
#Alabama 	#AlabamaSenate	Show us &amp; your children that you know the difference between right and wrong. Roll tide
@donnabrazile, go to hell...no we don't need you.
From a dating site. Hey, who wants to be with any who voted for that animal https://t.co/oKJUqfwHtg
We need to show more anger and disgust for some of the real pigs in the Republican Party in order to wake up decent people. Without our anger, they're not taking a second look and allowing s*** like Moore to exist and fkng lead. Wake up #Alabama, Doug Jones is a decent guy. https://t.co/LeaDrwCSgm
@Karoli Karoli, hugs, loved that post. We need more of that energy, more ANGER AND DISGUST!
# Alabama for god sakes come out of the Dark Ages. You're a beautiful state with beautiful people and you're not just a great football team. Kick the crap out of predator/molester/lunatic Roy Moore, vote DOUG JONES and do the right thing. Roll tide
@VABVOX I love @SenWarren and I could see her as my president except for the fact that she Pals around with @SenSanders, a death knell for me then to chime in with RIGGED,, she lost me totally. After seeing what misogyny did to Hillary, Y take a chance with Warren who stepped in it.
GOP sayin tax cuts r job creators: complete BS! These tax cuts come after all the Reagan &amp;Bush tax cuts and they are blow jobs for billionaires. Give a billionaire another billion or a million families an extra $1,000, which works better? The million families bcz it multiplies
Don't smell a wave @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @TomPerez @RepLoisFrankel Instead teach the electorate what they're voting for. If u do nothing, as always, but watch GOP get the hell out of politics. Teach them about econ, tax, inversion, stimulus &amp; about how senseless @SenSanders is
@MarkRuffalo @abigail_titmuss Guy is disgusting but so we're the Bernie or Bust imbeciles who took the vote away from the rest of us. &amp; @SenSanders, yr guy, never said 1 word to these kids that @HillaryClinton w/b a great POTUS but the SOB thanked Sarandon and Dawson his book. So it takes all kinds of scum.
And of course, @SenSanders endorsed the mayor of Atlanta and he lost. We are sick of him and the kids have to realize what he and Jill Stein did. Even w/all the fake sh*t thrown at Hillary w/o Sanders lies &amp;his fake candy promised to kids, she would have won easily.
@TheLadyHarley I totally agree, @BernieSanders didn't endorse  Ralph Northam because that MFer Sanders only wants to destroy, not win, just like Nader. Let's push that cranky old NRA whore out of politics. Better to lose Virginia? He's a lying a__hole who w/o inexperienced kids would be gone.
Role Tide for Doug Jones in Alabama to beat crazy and dangerous Judge Roy Moore, on Dec 12th, pass this on! Give any amount to Act Blue for Doug.  It's OUR SENATE no matter where we live.
Hey @SenSanders u haven't learned a fkn thing, not endorsing Northam in VA. U whored 4NRA, wouldn't give your taxes &amp; u lied to kids &amp; Northam doesn't meet your low standards? Ha!
Great night, let's now support Doug Jones in Alabama to beat that crazy lunatic Judge Roy Moore. We don't want that crazy MFer in the US Senate.
So, now divorced mothers &amp; their children will pay the price for billionaires to make more money. Typical Republican bullsh*t &amp; selfishness
In negotiations we tried to give the non working spouses more taxable income bcz they're in lower brackets that way we could give them more
If a propertied spouse made good $ he was able to give his wife &amp; kids more because it was deducted before he paid tax on it.
Alimony disappeared from Trump Tax. That means custodial non propertied spouses will receive a lot less $ because it won't be deducted
2 to his supporters but BS praised @SusanSarandon @rosariodawson in his book. Do you remember a time when he said you'd B great 2supporters? https://t.co/oQNJGrd2PB
1 @HillaryClinton I loved yr book but one thing I didn't understand. I never heard @SenSanders say you'd be a great or even good POTUS 2his》
@Drobsidian he thanks Sarandon &amp; Dawson for their great work. I want him gone from Democratic politics  along with Ellison, Nina Turner, Sarandon&amp;Dawson
@Drobsidian Please find 1 instance where @SenSanders said to his followers that Hillary would be a great president, yet ....
@Drobsidian It was not the conventional Democrats who effed this up and gave us Trump. It was the Bernie or bust people and they need to be weeded out.
@Drobsidian Sanders has to go and Keith Ellison should not be in the DNC because he's giving credibility to Brazile. He never should have been there.
@Drobsidian Yet in his new book our Revolution that SOB thanks Susan Sarandon and Rosario Dawson who will complete pigs (no typo) to Hillary.
@Drobsidian What good things has Sanders ever said about Hillary. Google it, find where Sanders told his followers how great a pres Hillary would be.
@Drobsidian I consider myself a Progressive it was a typo. As far as $22.50 for 2,000 hours, that's $45,000 a year, biz &amp; prices need time to adjust
@Drobsidian Ppl out there who destroyed this election because they understood nothing, none of the Sanders lies and candy, and I see it happening again
@Drobsidian Don, I agree but he won't do this again like nator try to come back and mess up 2004 and maybe he did some extent. They were Bernie or bust
@Drobsidian Nobody who owns a biz wld vote for $18 min wage a 160% increase. It should get there eventually as biz can adapt but biz couldn't handle $18
@Drobsidian Actually, that was a typo but Sanders is no progressive, he's a socialist anarchist who wants to tear everything down, i e and $18 min wage
@MikeAndMike Eli needs ritalin, his mind wanders too much and he screws up the clock and gives defense a chance for momentum at zero seconds too often.
RT @Drobsidian: One is never sure WHAT drives this claim but why even make it? https://t.co/nDGlKMg1ue - The gun thing is real. Piggressive…
@Drobsidian A little too f*****g late &amp; made a mockery out of that process &amp; gave Trump a pass. Where is 2015 and 2016, any GOP money he's hiding?
Hey @SenSanders u never submitted yr tax returns &amp; gave a nasty smirk when asked? U gave Trump cover &amp;ppl think yr a prigressive, bullshit
Hey @SenSanders ppl think yr a progressive, bullshit, u voted against Brady 5 times &amp;no liability 4gun shop that sold Kelley Ruger AR556
As a Republican or former, Y R GOPs still pushing Trkl Dwn when  it's destroying us. Blow Jobs to Billionaires? @NicolleDWallace
U have evolved into a great one. @NicolleDWallace Y R we still fighting Trickle Down when it's been a total failure creating $25 Triln Debt?
@NicolleDWallace @starincali How stupid do u have 2B @markdavis 2notC a campaign designed &amp;paid 4by Russia &amp;hiding tax returns 4same effort &amp;2 hide what a failure he is
@go4stimulus @donnabrazile @DNC She either lied or got 2 agreements @HillaryClinton signd w/DNC mixed up. @SenSanders bashed superdels until he needed them bcz he ws losing
@PhilipRucker She's out of her fkn mind,now wants 2destroy whole party? Get her &amp;her delusions out of here. Biden can be a flaming a__hole when left alone
@go4stimulus @donnabrazile @DNC Don't know Y @HillaryClinton didn't go after @SenSanders harder, exposing lies, arrogance, anarchy &amp; implying DEMs bring rigged sys.ScrewHim
@go4stimulus @donnabrazile @DNC Besides @SenSanders tried to tell stupid kids no diff btwn GOP&amp;Dems, just like  @RalphNader. He didn't deserve=treatment.Lying SOB NRA whore
@SenWarren Why did he make a mockery of the tradition of submitting tax returns to the voters, so as not to give Trump an out? SOB smirked
@SenWarren your pal tricked Dems. He was never anything but an anarchist whore for the NRA. Y didn't he give $ to the DNC 4other races?
@SenWarren Plus w/the way women voted in such a misogynistic &amp; disappointing way, who is going to take another chance with a woman so soon?
I liked @SenWarren a great deal up to today.  After that stunt blaming Hillary and the DNC when her pal BS f****d us over, ended that for me
@tttthreads @DMansini I voted for Hillary proudly but so many women didn't because they bought into the misogyny &amp; we ended up with a predator. No excuses.
@tttthreads @DMansini Warren trying to blow up party B4 we nominate Terry McAuliffe. She wants it but with the way women voted, I wouldn't vote for one in primary
@ClintSmithIII Also let's not forget  #Sorry4TrumpDayNov8 where Trump, Stein, Johnson &amp; non-voters get to apologize for Nov 8, 2016 &amp; move forward.
@ClintSmithIII Totally agree and get people to get absentee ballots to ensure they vote &amp; prevent Republicans removing polling resources in a Dem areas.
@jarodyak @SHAQ @jimmykimmel @SHAQ is poised, no lapses and no macho stuff, he's damn good but not better than @jimmykimmel but he could be in another day or 2! 😆
@SHAQ @jimmykimmel You are terrific filling in for Kimnel. Good job Shaq!
@punchumgum You too.  It got a little hairy here when people took Hillary vs Bernie sides and I lost friends because of that same irresponsible as Nader
So, what do U plan 2do on  #Sorry4TrumpDayNov8 ? Are u going to call Trump, Stein &amp; non voters 2give them a chance to apologize?
@punchumgum What's so angering is that everyone can do better but by killing the middle class, even the wealthy don't do as well &amp;our Treasuries shrink
@punchumgum I'm good, frustrated w/people  who vote without a general understand anything about the issues that affect them such as tax, econ &amp; jobs

Wow @Lawrence u remind me of what I hated about Moynahan. Reagan dropped top rate from approx 78% to 28%. That's not massive to you?

@NotJustNancy @shannonrwatts #s may be wrong. Canada cost of 72 ED pills at $4B for 12 of 22M vets. Surgery est is $2.4M or many times that but still very affordable
@NotJustNancy @shannonrwatts I feel like I'm digging hole here because there are great Americans who discover this need after they enter the military. Worth discussion.
@NotJustNancy @shannonrwatts However, I don't believe they should be prohibited to serve but maybe they should come into the military as the gender they want to be.
@NotJustNancy @shannonrwatts A kidney removal costs about $150,000 &amp; they'really not creating new genitals plus there's no pre care and aftercare. No rejection issues
@NotJustNancy @shannonrwatts If this costs 1/4 of Viagra for 15 million Vets, that's a huge amount of money. Can't do everything.
@NotJustNancy @shannonrwatts Yeah, but as a country we have to choose what 2spend money on.I'd rather fix bridges or fix schools. Don't think this is a military function
@shannonrwatts @NotJustNancy Xgender surg w/pre&amp;post care well over $200,000+ plus overhead maybe much more?   Viagra, $200. 22 million Vets, should expense be the same?
Is #SteveKornacki a Trump homer retained to shove reasonable doubt into any accusation to give Trump's base hope? Can't watch him anymore.
Sanders progressives have ideas how Hillary could have turned herself inside out to win. All they had to do is vote for the best candidate.
Sanders progressives who R disgusted w/Joe Arpaio pardon bcz he never apologized or showed contrition, where's yours after making Trump pres
How could people who voted for Stein or stayed home not apologize? How arrogant and stupid can they be? It's time to realize what you did
I hate @BernieSanders don't  want him 2B POTUS, if spoiled election 2make Trump pres I w/b apologizing forever. So, where r the appilogies?
I was stupid &amp; passed on that Fabrozio hoax on FB &amp; I apologized. U, who voted for Trump, Stein or didn't vote, WhenTF will u apologize?

Did Bernie ppl ever read the quote about Super Predators or did @ninaturner just keep gratuitously using it? &amp; Sanders voted for that bill 2
They played on all the nonsense misinformation from WikiLeaks and then  kept feeding it while Trump was never exposed.
Even a 1% tax on securities trades would end day trading &amp; there goes the revenue &amp; $71B was one tenth of the cost, he lied.
Do I want Universal Healthcare ans free college, of course, but not until it's deficit possible.  His plans were BS w/incorrect math
Now, thanks to Sanders and his team,  we're not even America anymore.
Yes, many in the DNC didn't like Sanders and his pie in the sky lies, I didn't either bcz I knew they couldn't happen. We are bit Finland.
When asked about what to expect with a president Hillary, Sanders repeated that remains to be seen. He&amp;his team gave Trump the election
Sanders&amp;all those working for him except Simone said nothing good about Hillary only bad things about Trump. I lost my respect 4 Bernie
Maybe it's time for progressives not to be fooled by Nader, Sarandon, Sanders &amp; his people.  Bernie lied plenty but people were seeing candy
Voted for Hillary they convinced enough who can't think to see Hillary as the anti Christ &amp; they voted for Stein, Johnson&amp;Trump ir nobody..

@CarolAnneKnapp like I said, some of us have memories and not sound bites and useless puctures.
@CarolAnneKnapp maybe that picture was sent to him so that he would help in the House but how after all these years HE was never mentioned
@CarolAnneKnapp BS, he was never around when she faced the Republicans. Don't take things out of context. His name was never mentioned.
Bernie didn't help Hillary at all w/Healthcare but the SOB was there 4a photo op at Dartmouth.She went against Gingrich, Armey&amp;DeLay ALONE
Hillary wasn't 4Citizens United, she hates it. We're all getting sick of BS' BS. He doesn't have to worry abt a gen'l election, she does.

@jillwklausen again, another ridiculous statement w/o math.If that were true, there'd be construction crews everywhere. The comedy of fools
@fanseaartist release the donation detail to the FEC. He's lying as he always does.
@fanseaartist I know what Republicans did w/Nader &amp; I head they're doing it with Sanders bcz they all say they'd love 2run against him.
@fanseaartist prove it by releasing  donation detail to FEC. He reported 28%, Hillary 88%. If he's hiding GOP $,  then what wld u say?

@jillwklausen how old are you Jill? I'm experienced, liberal and understand taxes, You're here 4what exactly?  Not to make America better.
20.I knew Bernie Sanders before most of his supporters hit puberty or were even born &amp;I always loved him but not for President. Senate, yes
WhoTF is Paul Waldman &amp; what does he know abt econ &amp;taxes &amp; if u google enough, u can find **** that says anything https://t.co/XO50iJ6G9D
Repubs r giving 2Bernie not Hillary bcz they know who they can beat.Besides until he reports more than 28% who knows https://t.co/8CSSF831lr
19.It's amazing what Sanders ppl &amp; Trump ppl let go by bcz they are naive &amp; informed abt politics. BS &amp; Trump both lie &amp;U all accept it DUMB
18.It's Ok 4BS 2 lie abt $27 avg donation &amp;only report 28% of detail 2 FEC. Doesn't want U 2 C Republican $. U Check if yr all so righteous
17.Americans will not vote for a conscientious objector, a true Socialist maybe Communist, who said these things	https://t.co/1CKXlhek6v
16.He's made some very poor decisions. Voting agaisnt Desert Storm was stupid, voting against TARP &amp;Autos were moronic as voting agnst Brady
15.And many of you don't know that she was the liberal side of the Clinton Adm. 2 blame her 4 NAFTA is silly unless you blame Bernie 4 Brady
14.Hillary can do it all &amp;if she were a ohony, as some of u imply, she wouldn't have the huge # of quality very liberal friends she has and
13.Nobody in politics is perfect bcz u have to make deals but 2think Sanders is perfect, w/his misreps of costs &amp;Brady vote &amp;others is dumb
12.Who disgustingly changed his vote 4 NRA 4 times against Brady Bill so they wouldn't fund someone against him, she never changed a vote.
11.All Hillary has to say is I hate Superpacs but that's the law &amp; to even things up I need that money agaisnt the Kochs but unlike BS, who
10.Sanders having a bigger lead over all the Republicans is nonsense bcz Sanders has not been touched &amp; unfortunately Hillary won't kill him
9.Think abt what life will be like in America wtih one of the Republicans as President. It will be horrendous &amp; despite what polls say about
8.I loved Bernie B4 all of u did &amp;4 decades until he planned to run for President. He's not the one &amp;I hope OH, FL, Il &amp; MS fininsh him off
7.U can't follow that same moronic 2000 logic bcz now so much more is at stake, it's all at stake &amp;saying I told u so, will not help anyone
6.U say if we can go 2War we can educate all USAnbut those of U who stupidly voted for Nader got Bush to bankrupt us made that impossible
5.You R arrogantly &amp; stupidly Nadering the Democratic Party. Arrogant Nader ppl had no problem w/that in 2000 &amp; look what happened w/Bush
4.Gen'l pop will hear Revolution &amp; BS is deep fried. In the meantime u r killing our best chance 4 change by making up crap abt Hillary
3.To think every1 will just lay down 4vBS is stupid, esp w/ the way he lies to the kids who vote for him &amp; he will be wearing a Scarlett L
2.If Sanders wins, he will get 0passed let alone tax increases, he's lame duck Bernie. W/O House&amp;Sen u get nothing passed except impeachment
1.BS ppl, do u know how a bill bcms a law?  House has a Rmaj 246-188 Senate Rmaj 54-46. If Trump/C/R/K wins, ACA, abortion, LGB, SupCt  gone
@jillwklausen esp bcz he makes no sense mathematically w/o revolution. If he doesn't make sense to me, and I like him, America will hate him
@jillwklausen Jill, you'll be introduced to a whole new world of viciuos ad hominem attacks if BS gets nomination, w/his talk of revolution

I like Bernie, but not for President, not our President...the President of Finland or Norway or Luxembourg, that's his speed
The media will love the show and Sanders will melt down to nothing because he fantasizes and lies but 18 yr olds don't know any better
They will have so much fun with his math and economics, they will ridicule him and he can't defend it because he's wrong and off the walls
When Trump starts 2attack Sanders, I don't know if he can physically survive it. He hardly makes it through Hillary criticism &amp; they r mild
change under president Trump or Cruz and we'll talk about how arrogant &amp; stupid you were later, just like we did w/Nader blind supporters
Nader voters were arrogant to and told us if Gore loses the Democrats deserve it. Is that what you sanders ppl believe now. See how yr lives
I think u ppl who R reckless &amp;arrogantly believe that voting for Sanders is worth bringing Trump to the White House r like Nader voters
Sanders is a wind up screaming Socialist/maybe communist who can't get anything done bcz he'd be put in limbo for 4 year, maybe impeached
Who's going to pay 4all the perposefully orphaned kids frm Central America &amp; Mexico that Bernie wants to bring in &amp;criticizes Hillary for?
Whose going to build the buildings to educate13M more college students while fixing all the rest of the infrastructure for $1Trillion
Is Sanders going to take over United Healthcare, Humana &amp; Wellpoint or buy them out too?  What about the stockholders, the 401Ks?
Is Sanders going to take over the private colleges or buy them or march in the preletariat army?  Where will the money come from.
20M kids in college, what will it cost to educated 33M.  He thinks $72B from his 1% spec tax that will never happem leaving $728/yr w/no $
and it looks like he has every intention to bankrupt us.  Don't think he's a Democrat bcz he's not.  He's irrational &amp; he lies to kids
Bernie supporters post pics of Hillary w/bank bumper stickers, what abt Sanders as Karl Marx or a communtist. He doesn't want capitalism
Maybe Hillary supporters need 2start attacking Sanders like he'd b attacked if he got the nomination bcz he's thinks he can beat Trump et al
@coldwomaninmn @AWiseLatina in other words his math is so far off it's pathetic that the press &amp; even Hillary don't attack it. She must!
@coldwomaninmn @AWiseLatina Well,  because he can't get elected &amp; if he did he can't do ANYTHING bcz of $ and he'd be ignored for 4 years

We’re electing a Pres not Senator who had to figure out if Bush is a liar. In 91 Sanders voted against the Gulf War and that was wrong
If Hillary were President in 2000, good chance 9/11 would never have happened and for certain Iraq War would never have happened,

@Isikoff On FEC site BS shows $94M -excel sheet shows $26.5M (28%), think he's hiding GOP donors?  HRC shows $120M and $106M (88%) on Excel

@JremySpencer @BernieSanders BO was too moderate rme &amp;I predicted on Dailykos that he'd let the Bush tax cuts go on  &amp;they troll rated me!
@JremySpencer @BernieSanders he's helped Hillary pull away from Bill and she will be phenomenal.  As far as 2008 I didn't want BO as pres..
@JremySpencer @BernieSanders Is done, The caucus parties are over. I still love him, maybe even more now, but I don't want him as nominee.
@JremySpencer @BernieSanders has these kids believing he can win and beat the GOP. How stupid is that, and based on Bernie Math, a fraud.

@lady10314 average $27 but GOP Rangers give $2,700 &amp; if he God forbid he gets the nomination, they go away and he's broke vs a billion $
@davidsirota who is yr BS artist getting $ from if he gets the nom &amp;GOP $ go away &amp; he goes up against Koch $.  He loses &amp;we're screwed.
@lady10314 these kids don't know how true that is.  I love Sarandon as an actress but despise her as an American.  She screwed us w/Nader.
@SusanSarandon U had kids 2deceive in 2000 too when U tricked them 2vote 4 Nader, how'd that work out? R they getting free college? Bull****
@SusanSarandon U loved Nader too, no thanks, GOP couldn't have a better operative. U, Robbins &amp;Donahue lied 2 EVERYONE.  GOP prays 4Sanders
If BS wins nom, what's going 2happen when he stops getting GOP $$ like Nader did? BS v Koch &amp; Adelson.  Could GOP ever be  happier, no way!
@ScottPelley if she lied,  let's hear it. U work 4CBS NEWS &amp; you can't point out lies? They don't exist.  GOP lied not Hillary.
@ScottPelley Maybe one of U morons in the press shd make Sanders expl in detail how he will pay 4anything.  R U capable of that w/comebacks?
@ScottPelley After decades of useless GOP investigations w/NOTHING found EVER,  U need to ask Hillary about lies? How pathetic are you!

@WaterflowerM @marieann66 God forbid, no questions by the press for Bernie. They only ask him how bad Hillary is. They are useless.
@WaterflowerM @marieann66 Where's the line? Wealthy ppl pre tx @ $150,000/yr, to pay $65,000/yr 4their kids &amp; then pay tax 4 other kids?
@jheil @MarkHalperin Did I miss yr tough Qs of Bernie, like how he's paying 4 everything or did you just ask how bad Hillary is? PATHETIC
So,  Sanders liars are trying to make ppl think Hillary is doing more illegal quid pro quos. These ppl R disgusting. https://t.co/WlO9jZ9PvB
@marieann66 @tomwatson But just like w/Nader, they're Rangers giving Sanders $$. Maybe his ppl were trying 2hide that while on DNC website
@davidsirota @IBTimes Hillary should do that but only after Sanders provides a list of his donors &amp; amounts so we can see how many are GOP ☺
@RedRoadRail Sarah, why haven't they been arrested, that's treasonous?
@ARTSYJUDITH @MSNBC Ridiculous. If God forbid Sanders is the nominee,  all GOP canons will be aimed at him &amp; they'll destroy him.
