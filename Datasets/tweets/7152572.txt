What is a serendipitous moment that you've had recently? #SerendipityRun
Horace (the first one) made up the word in reference to a Persian Fairy tale 'The Princes of Serendip', in which the protagonists were 'always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things which they were not in quest of' #SerendipityRun https://t.co/srmz6hCIr1
The word 'serendipity' was coined by the art historian Horace Walpole (the 4th Earl of Orford!) in 1754, to explain to a friend (also named Horace) a surprising discovery of a lost work by the Italian painter Giorgio Vasari. #SerendipityRun https://t.co/OJUDIxd0Te

@_haleymarie4 Don’t be afraid of digital. Also, don’t assume digital will solve any problems. Take some coding tutorials, learn abt the issues with digital preservation, learn the lingo so you can communicate strategically regardless of format. – @gracehthom, Web Archiving Team #AskAnArchivist

@kittyBBQ @laurenbgood @TheWittliff @txstmfa @PersonaLitMag If something is digital, it will last forever. Things on the web are ephemeral &amp; constantly changing, and since many items are published on the web instead of through print, the web needs to be archived as well as print materials. - @gracehthom Web Archiving Team #AskAnArchivist
@kittyBBQ @laurenbgood @TheWittliff @txstmfa @PersonaLitMag That an archivist only works with dusty old papers...actually we handle all kinds of things – audio &amp; video, photographs &amp; much more. You’d be surprised at some of the unusual things found in archives! -Kelly Revak, Processing Archivist, American Folklife Center #AskAnArchivist
@phoebestuff The Library has one of the oldest examples of printing, passages from a Buddhist sutra, printed in 770 A.D. The oldest written material in the Library is a cuneiform tablet dating from 2040 B.C. Here are some early examples of writing, https://t.co/QeAd7jSUfC. #AskAnArchivist

@cobillard The Library has hundreds of catalogers whose job it is to describe the collections including books, manuscripts, photographs, maps, sound, film, etc. The info provided by catalogers (metadata) is searchable by search engines. #AskAnArchivist

In planning this event, we tried to spotlight collections in several different formats and from several different eras. As you know, though, every box can have its surprises. Thank you again for following along! #PresTC
The diversity of archival collections, and the diversity of research that archives support, is inspiring and when it comes to preservation, challenging as well. #PresTC
I hope you enjoyed the research and case studies we shared today. The record of our country does not exist in any single library or archive. It is a shared responsibility and I hope each of you is recognized for the work you do to preserve archival collections. #PresTC
Thank you all for participating in this #PresWk event, and thank you to @SAApreservation for partnering with the Library of Congress to help us share this information.
@lljohnston Great! Send a message to preserve@loc.gov and we'll get back to you. #PresTC
Thank you, Amanda! We will now hear some closing remarks from Jacob Nadal, the Library of Congress Director for Preservation. Take it away, Jake. #PresTC
@ExploreYourEdge That's great, Alison! Thank you.
@RMHayes Here is one collection of ethnographic wax cylinder recordings available online, https://t.co/VQx2iRi2ye. #PresTC
I (Amanda May) host a Washington, D.C. area support group for recovering born-digital data from legacy media items. Members also discuss access and description issues. #PresTC
Emulators like DosBox have helped us to provide access to some recovered files like a database of the Nuremberg Trials documents or weather simulations by Edward Lorenz: https://t.co/72gVDQwL2j #PresTC
PRD works with many different sections in the Library, including Manuscript, Music, American Folklife &amp; others. We are working on a special project with Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound to preserve videogames, including scans of packaging and instructions. #PresTC
For most projects, we create a disk image, extract the files, and take a Tiff image of the original item. This is packaged together with BagIt (https://t.co/qLWp5WS19z), with all files hashed. #PresTC
The KryoFlux images floppy disks at the magnetic flux level, creating a preservation image without regard to format. This has helped preserve data from disks with non-standard formatting like WaveMate Bullet and also saved data from a partially melted disk! #PresTC https://t.co/hlHJGATBDq
Recovering the data from each type of media requires different equipment: Forensic Recovery of Evidence Devices (FRED), hardware write blockers, an FC5025, a KryoFlux, specialized software, and cables. So. Many. Cables. #PresTC https://t.co/ZBFXY39kwU
@OneSquire Light and humidity less so. Temperature is key.
The Preservation Reformatting Division processes archival collections with born-digital materials, which may include CDs, DVDs, 5.25” and 3.5” floppies, Zip disks, computers, or more obscure formats. #PresTC https://t.co/HnBzwue82R
Thanks, Eric! Next up is Amanda May of the Preservation Reformatting Division (PRD). Amanda will present “Digital Forensics: Preserving Born-Digital Archival Materials from Obsolete Media.” #PresTC
The Library’s wax cylinders are stored in a 50F vault. To limit the risk to wax cylinders when they are moved to the digitization labs, they are now packed in coolers to slow any temperature change. #KeepItSimple #PresTC https://t.co/8Tbos8ozkM
Next we looked at how the waxes reacted to temperature changes. Lab-made materials broke quickly under thermal cycling conditions. #PresTC https://t.co/OAAJDtghnf
Scientific instruments were used to compare the metals and organic compound composition of the wax cylinder materials. Outside of some contaminants, the materials were chemically the same but they are NOT degrading. #Confusing #NotWhatWeExpected #PresTC https://t.co/YGA78HqAHa
Armed with the recipes and methods, we recreated each of the compositions so we could compare the period wax cylinder materials with new simulant to see how (or if) the material was degrading. #ScienceLikeIts1889 #PresTC https://t.co/O1TpxYkO1g
The wax cylinder material is made like soap, by partially saponifying stearic and palmitic acid with a sodium base in the presence of aluminum, with ceresin wax added later to soften the material. #MadeLikeSoap #PresTC https://t.co/f9SpSMysaI
Here is an image of patent infringement lawsuit and lab notebooks from the @edisonpapers #PresTC https://t.co/LZEs62Iush
By examining legal records from a patent infringement lawsuit and lab notebooks from the @edisonpapers @RutgersU, we identified the materials that were produced commercially. #ArchivesFTW #PresTC
Scientists in the Preservation Research and Testing Division have been studying the cylinders to identify why they might break and how to best preserve the wax cylinders. #BringInTheScientists #PresTC
Ethnographic field recordings were made on brown wax cylinders beginning in 1890. While most of the collection is in excellent shape, occasionally, cylinders have been found to have cracked during storage. Here is a cracked brown wax cylinder. #PresTC https://t.co/dE44P1iGx3
The Library’s collections of wax cylinders include thousands of ethnographic field recordings along with commercial and private recordings. These represent the first commercially successful sound recordings. #EarlyRecordedSound #PresTC https://t.co/EcSZj426a3
Thanks, Shelly &amp; Betsy! Next Eric Monroe of the Preservation Research and Testing Division will discuss “Wax Cylinders: archival research to support scientific research in preservation of audio archives.” #PresTC
High-resolution color images of Madison’s notes are now available to scholars and the public: https://t.co/6D8EugO0FC. #PresTC
Conservation staff do all of the careful handling of the documents in order to minimize any potential damage from flexing of pages (with corroded or vulnerable ink) &amp; from removal &amp; reinsertion into housings. Photos of conservators positioning documents for digitization. #PresTC https://t.co/TJeAI8Zu9D
Security for a National Treasure is paramount. To limit transportation, digital scan staff set up a scanning station (camera, copy stand, processor &amp; monitor) close to where the items are stored. #PresTC
Documentation, written and photographic, of treatment performed on National Treasures is required by LOC regulations and professional guidelines. Conservators wrote detailed reports of condition before &amp; after treatment and of all procedures and repair materials used. #PresTC
Assessment revealed that about 50 pages required minor stabilization, mostly mending small tears and reinforcing weak areas. Conservators used ultra-thin mulberry paper that had been pre-coated with reversible adhesive (Klucel-G) that was reactivated with ethanol. #PresTC
For Madison’s notes, conservators conducted a detailed assessment of every page, noting the condition of the paper (tears, creases) and of the ink (corrosion, flaking). Every page had to be able to withstand scanning without damage. #PresTC
First things to consider from a Conservation POV: Are the pages in good condition? Is treatment needed? Can they be handled and scanned safely? #PresTC
Madison’s notes are 600+ pages of his detailed observations of the convention’s daily proceedings. More from LOC Historian Julie Miller: https://t.co/G5MPArCExr. #PresTC
When digitizing a Library of Congress National Treasure, Conservation is involved throughout. James Madison’s Notes on the Constitutional Convention (detail image attached) were recently digitized at LOC. How’d we do it? #PresTC https://t.co/GBzq1gqTTr
Thanks, Jeanne! Next we have Shelly Smith and Betsy Haude of the Conservation Division. They will discuss “Conservation and Digitization of a National Treasure: James Madison’s Notes on the Constitutional Convention” #PresTC
Collections care for archival materials also includes making enclosures and procuring the correct housing supplies. You can see specifications for the materials we use here: https://t.co/v8modn5rId #PresTC
The LaFollette papers document the activities of one of our nation’s prominent political families, including 2 generations who served in the House &amp; Senate. Collection includes diaries, speeches, correspondence, legislative, legal &amp; campaign files https://t.co/xMjW3FWbah. #PresTC
This is the sheet treater - as in “archival papers,” not floral or patterned - used to treat manuscripts. Each year we treat ~ 1 million sheets of archival material. We just completed the NAACP collections (https://t.co/HLGsgTz0xH) &amp; the La Follette Papers are in process. #PresTC https://t.co/JtknpKPk58
We use the Bookkeeper process (MgO, think milk of magnesia, in a carrier liquid) to extend the life of paper. Manuscript collections are treated onsite to provide required levels of safety and security. #PresTC
The deacidification program, I call it antacid for paper, has been active at the Library for nearly 20 years, for bound volumes and archival collections. https://t.co/jTPxG4fA0T. #PresTC
First up is Jeanne Drewes, Chief of the Binding and Collections Care Division. Jeanne will discuss the deacidification of archival materials. #PresTC
