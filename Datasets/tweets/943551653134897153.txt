Please senator at least go to work, because sometimes we talk more than we work, please let's do it the other way, let's work more and talk less please,
Saying that Serena got robbed is a ly she Lost simple as that,
You're,like it or not Serena Lost we have to agree,Ramos didn't do nothing wrong,that have nothing to do with sex, let's stop crying about it,
Until today parents don't know what to do about sending their kids to school,	I hope Washington/ United Nations can say something or take action in the 3.5 billions dollars from Petro caribe that still missing....
I guess until today the Haitian people in Haiti are still waiting for the international community to say something about the situation in Haiti who actually getting worst day by day,where our corrupted leaders are getting themselves richer every day sad situation....
I'm glad senator you're watching the situation in Zimbabwe, good job, but what do you think about the situation in Haiti 500 miles from the US, for hundreds yrs Haitian people being suffering, until today majority of them don't  have access to clean water???
I think it would make sense for us to fix our neighbors countries before we go as far sirya,
Until when people in Venezuela, people in Haiti, people in Honduras will have a better country for them to stay in their own country,
Yes it's about time for the US to decide to fix the immigration problem we have and it's only in the American continent,	We are going all to the middle East to fix countries, and then country like Haiti, Honduras,El Salvador inside the American continent we refuse to fix them..
Mark Jackson you will never like golden State because you were a failure for golden State from 2011 to 2014
Mark I know why you don't like golden State,it doesn't surprise me,
Jeff can Fundy,stop being a looser as a reporter, it's not too late for you to learn how to play basketball,every fault on Cleveland is ok for you, but no fault on golden State is ok for you....
Laura Ingraham needs to be of the air definitely, because she's a horrible,
Well too bad Mr Santorum doesn't understand the pain these kids and these families are going thru in parkland Florida, hopefully one day he will be in the spot to understand how painful it is as a father,
It's about time for Washington needs to decide about Haiti, after over 200 years , Haitians has enough, either they decide to fix Haiti or let Haitians running the country themselves,
Senator Booker,im a big fan of yours,but we need some action people from Haiti need your help,60 thousands Haitians under the TPS program need help, it's time to show leadership because people from Haiti has enough for over 200 years Haiti been forgotten by the international,
It shows clearly that NRA has nothing to do with 2nd amendment,it just a criminal organization,

A country like Haiti with a Nation who Believe in God been tortured centuries by those who think they are more powerful than God,I believe there's one God the creator is taking note one day like today he will defend that Nation once for all for the world to see he is God.

Don just letting you know that im a big fan of your show, and as a haitian American im embarrassed for the America in general because an American president calling other countries in the same continent shit hole specially Haiti,it is unbelievable...
I think it is a shame,
Im a big fan of your show,but im shock to see you making a joke with what the president said about country like Haiti
Not only the dreamers who need a green program,the 60 thousands Haitians under the TPS program need to be a part of it also,not it's not the president it's up to Congress to act.
