Proud to join @RepAlLawsonJR in reintroducing the APEX Act to ensure a fair and free market for #aluminum pricing so our nation’s beverage companies can continue to produce some of America’s most popular beverages! 		Read my full statement here: https://t.co/U3gSBIBv9s
Good economic news. Let's keep it up! https://t.co/CF34TyFkfD
If a child finds a firearm in a park and their parent surrenders the gun to a nearby police officer, the transfer shouldn’t be criminalized! 		But that’s what will happen under #HR8 the Democrats gun control bill. 		Watch my floor remarks HERE: https://t.co/GyGFhoGKze. #Support2A
The Dems gun control bill criminalizes gun transfers between law-abiding citizens who have NO criminal record and NO criminal intent! #2ndAmendment #Support2A
#ICYMI last night I joined my colleagues on the House Floor to talk about the greatest threat to our nation: the #nationaldebt. Watch my remarks here: https://t.co/5xVFNE0ARg https://t.co/LS94Twfivp
We cannot keep adding to our national debt &amp; annual deficit. It is not only unsustainable, but it is an unfair burden to place on future generations. I’m proud to be a cosponsor and would like to thank @RepAndyBiggsAZ for recognizing our country’s serious spending problem. https://t.co/wF2cqGBH2M
TUNE IN: I’ll be live in just a few minutes on @KOANewsRadio with @AprilZesbaugh @ContactLenz_KOA to discuss President Trump’s national emergency declaration
Next week, Democrats will bring flawed #HR8 to the House floor. It WON’T stop criminals! It WILL criminalize a friend or step-parent loaning a gun to a victim of domestic violence so she can defend herself! #2ndAmendment
Today we pay tribute to all the courageous leaders who have helped shape our great nation. Happy #PresidentsDay! https://t.co/jiQ1UEA6Mq
"If illegal immigrants are going to get guns then we better tell ICE...so that ICE can arrest them and deport them and make this country safer." Democrats would prefer to keep ICE from knowing when illegal immigrants try to purchase guns. Read here: https://t.co/KuzQaevVi5
#ICYMI this morning, listen to my reaction to the border security deal and the president's decision to declare a national emergency on @KOANewsRadio here: https://t.co/5UkzGUi7KF
Tune-in on @KOANewsRadio now! https://t.co/nHrEjXw3GW
COMING UP: I'll be joining @IngrahamAngle with @HeyTammyBruce to talk about the bad border security deal that Congress put forth less than 24 hours ago. Tune in at 10PM ET (8PM MT) on @FoxNews https://t.co/XfSj3D8Ba1
The American people deserve better than this terrible deal. I will be voting NO on this bill that continues the pattern of reckless spending, ties our ICE agents’ hands, and fails to secure our southern border.
It took Democrats less than TWO months to break their new rule requiring all Members have at least 72hrs to review bills. This 1,169 page bill was filed at 12:05AM &amp; had a new division added at 1:20AM. We aren’t even getting 24hrs to review all the terrible things in this bill!
How is this deal a compromise? It funds only 55 miles of fencing for $1.375 billion along a limited section of the border in exchange for preventing ICE from doing their jobs, including deporting MS-13 gang members. All while continuing out of control federal spending.
So Andrew McCabe and his cronies at the Justice Department conspired to invoke the 25th Amendment to target and remove @POTUS from office. This is nothing short of a coup by the FBI. It is absolutely disgraceful &amp; everyone involved deserves to be prosecuted to the fullest extent.
Here in Washington, we have a duty to the Constitution and to the American people to declare &amp; oversee our country’s war efforts. Today, I was glad to see my amendment adopted to the War Powers Resolution with bipartisan support. Watch my remarks here: https://t.co/JGJafW1fw5
Today, @JudiciaryGOP considered my amendment to #HR8 to 'Restore Individuals’ Second Amendment Rights.' This is about giving non-violent criminal offenders a second chance and restoring individuals' gun rights. Watch my remarks here: https://t.co/7DgCdQ0kGG
Our national debt just topped $22 trillion dollars for the first time. This is unfair to the American people. Even worse, it is an unfair burden to place on our children. I believe both parties need to come together and find ways to limit and reduce spending.
I am deeply saddened by the passing of my dear friend and colleague, @RepWalterJones. He was a dedicated public servant to the people of North Carolina for over two decades and he will be missed by many. May God bless him and grant his family peace.
Iran continues to develop its missile capabilities despite UNSC action. We must ensure that the Iranian regime does not gain a nuclear weapon and hold them accountable for violating international law. https://t.co/6Kjz0TV4T5
Today @RepZoeLofgren and I introduced bipartisan legislation, the Fairness for High Skilled Immigrants Act of 2019 (H.R. 1044), to eliminate arbitrary per-country limits that cause backlogs in the employment-based green card system. Read HERE: https://t.co/riSXlwbfDd
Everyone's voice deserves to be heard, especially one of our own @HouseGOP. https://t.co/KoGt2swy7Q
.@HouseJudiciary is meeting today to discuss legislation to prevent mass violence. #HR8 claims to be a solution, but solves nothing. It’s disingenuous to advocate for new laws that won’t work while refusing to enforce current laws that would prevent violent crimes.
#ICYMI: Listen to my radio interview with @KOANewsRadio this morning https://t.co/YpE7jaTcqK

Glad I could join my colleagues to discuss a constitutional issue that needs to be addressed, and I hope we can pass this War Powers Resolution in the House to reclaim our legislative authority over war-making activities in Congress for the sake of our men and women in uniform. https://t.co/JMQZJUlZmo
House Judiciary held its first hearing on #HR1 to “restore our democracy.” This bill does the exact opposite. Instead of protecting the integrity of our elections it encourages voter fraud &amp; undermines the American electoral system. Here are my remarks: https://t.co/B3BYbG9rJI
Our elections should be fair and free from all forms of manipulations. H.R. 1 on the other hand, promotes voter fraud and uses taxpayer money to fund partisan political campaigns. @JudiciaryGOP

Glad to see that HR 5635, The Medical Cannabis Research Act, was adopted by voice in @HouseJudiciary today. This bill wisely regulates medical marijuana research and helps our veterans by allowing the VA to discuss potential medical marijuana trials with them.

We need to keep taxes low and regulations rolled back so that businesses in this nation can keep adding jobs. https://t.co/QaPiImYg5h

Russia’s attempts to influence the 2016 election are disgraceful. We should work to improve American relations with our adversaries, but not at the cost of our nation’s soul.

“These are people who could be sent home but instead are sent back to sell more opioids to more people.” - @JessicaV_CIS. Local officers should be able to work with federal authorities to keep heroin traffickers out of this country.
Law enforcement witnesses at this hearing agree that authorities at all levels need to work together to fight this heroin trafficking epidemic. @HouseJudiciary
Sanctuary city policies are often allowing illegal immigrants with drug charges to avoid ICE detainers, sending criminal aliens "back to the streets to keep working for the drug trafficking organizations." - @JessicaV_CIS
"Sanctuary policies can act as a magnate for foreign criminal organizations, because they know that immigration violations will be overlooked..." - @JessicaV_CIS
"They're being handcuffed." Detective Nick Rogers explains how he and his fellow officers feel about the Denver ordinance that prevents DPD officers from working with federal authorities to fight illegal immigrants who traffic in heroin.
