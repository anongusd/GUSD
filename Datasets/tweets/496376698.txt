And contracts change. That's what happened to folks like Dan Faden and Bob Ruckdeschel at KSC. Their contracts stripped off the back pay provision a few years ago. So while previously they got paid post-shutdown, this time they didn't. 	https://t.co/1pH70OdrU3 https://t.co/sqOrty2PzT
Why aren't contractors guaranteed back pay? It all comes down to the individual contracts and if they include the provision for back pay. Most do not. 	But until the 35-day shutdown, we were looking at a few days of lost pay. 	This time, it was 2 paychecks	https://t.co/1pH70OdrU3

@LisaLooksAt Should've looked at your profile before I answered this! Obviously you already know this, Lisa, haha.
@LisaLooksAt Yeah great question. The timeshare industry's take is that it's eliminating companies that scam consumers, and that they now offer their own exit programs. But, of course, there are a number of limitations there, too. The resale market continues to be lesser known to consumers.
From @clubwyndham CEO Mike Brown: ‚ÄúIf you were to go back 5 to 6 years, the industry wasn‚Äôt as prepared to provide an easy off-ramp to owners...In the absence of a lot of clear programs, people filled that vacuum unfortunately in the wrong way.‚Äù	The story: https://t.co/PLlyAWpTEY https://t.co/HceKeLk0W5
In the most prominent case, a lawyer (and founder of Tea Party Nation) was disbarred for scamming consumers. This is our story on that case: https://t.co/nqtnJc6shi
But Brian Rogers at @TUGTIMESHARE says the timeshare industry created the exit industry by not giving owners a way out. 	‚ÄúThey are both in the same cesspool, as far as we are concerned ...They wouldn‚Äôt exist if the industry itself didn‚Äôt practice the way that it does.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a war, we are in a war right now,‚Äù said Brandon Reed, CEO of @TimeshareExitTM. ‚ÄúThey are coming together &amp; saying, ‚ÄòWe are going to take out exit companies.‚Äô‚Äù	Timeshare Exit Team, the leader in the industry, says it's not the scam the timeshare industry is going after.
Some timeshare exit companies that claim they can get out out of your timeshare are charging as much as $11,000 for the service. 	The #timeshare industry says they're scammers, and has filed dozens of lawsuits across the nation. 	https://t.co/PLlyAWpTEY @orlandosentinel

@mtlawmiami @DavidJNeal @BiancaJoanie @GabrielleRusson @marcosantana We may have to follow up on this. We stayed and kept insisting that something be done and they said it was out of their hands.
@DavidJNeal @BiancaJoanie @GabrielleRusson @marcosantana He was given some citation of some kind. The police caught up with us 20 minutes later and caught him across the street, so we weren't clear on what they gave him. But he wasn't arrested, and they'd only press charges if the parking garage chose to do so.
@BiancaJoanie This part is still really bothering me, too.
@DavidJNeal @BiancaJoanie @GabrielleRusson @marcosantana Yep, while heading into a parking garage after lunch. We were followed while this man exposed and touched himself within a foot of us.
@BiancaJoanie @GabrielleRusson @marcosantana Props to you for thinking quickly on your feet.
Police said they couldn't arrest this man, despite us capturing video of the offense, because a police officer didn't witness it, a child wasn't involved and it was on "private property," aka a parking garage and later a breezeway between buildings. 	IN. SANE. https://t.co/Ay1mDE7fqL

Miguel D√≠az-Canel, who became Cuba's president on April 19, headed to the scene after receiving word of the crash.		"The news is not very hopeful," he said.
Although the plane was leased from Global Air, Cubana de Aviacion's aging fleet has faced safety issues in the past. 	Yesterday, the Cuban National Aviation Authority grounded Cubana de Aviaci√≥n's AN-158 fleet due to technical issues. The plane that crashed was a Boeing 737.
So far, three survivors have been found in the wreckage. 	An employee at Calixto Garcia hospital in Havana told Reuters that one of the 3 survivors died at the hospital from burns and other trauma. The remaining 2 survivors at the hospital were still in serious condition.
The plane was a Boeing 737-200 on a flight from Havana to Holgu√≠n. The plane that was leased by Cubana de Aviaci√≥n, the Cuban national airline, from a Mexican company.
(THREAD) Here's what we have so far on the plane crash in Cuba, with @HeraldMimi:	105 people, including foreign crew, were on the plane when it crashed in an agricultural area just outside Havana at 12:08 p.m.  	https://t.co/ID7Sempm1F @MiamiHerald

From the father of Jaime Guttenberg, one of Kyle‚Äôs friends who lost her life. https://t.co/2xxIcPdkER
@RussoHockey @VanessaMLane @DavidJNeal Thank you for sharing!
Ah one more thing: I told Kyle this, and perhaps he won't realize it until later, but he's so brave for telling his story. It takes courage to let a stranger into your house &amp; tell them about the things troubling you. 	For me, it was such a privilege to be trusted with it.
He has a long road ahead of him still. His parents have scheduled appointments with a psychologist. He may have a few more surgeries. And the thoughts of Feb. 14 will likely continue. 	But he has an incredible support system and I have a feeling Kyle will come out stronger. / END
Tomorrow, Kyle will undergo his first surgery since the shooting to liposuction the flap on his wound. The surgery will hopefully give his right ankle a more natural shape -- and make it easier for him to walk on his own.
But anything can set him off. 	Once while I was at his house, rain pouring outside, police sirens started wailing. 	He stopped petting his dog &amp; looked out toward the sound, as if in a trance. 	‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bad one,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt sound that when it‚Äôs not an emergency.‚Äù
Though Kyle does struggle, most of his days are relatively normal. His family keeps everything light and they joke around a lot. 	Kyle just wants to walk again, play Airsoft, run, drive. It frustrates him that he can't go to his surfing summer camp or to his Fire Explorer program
His mom, Marie, said it best:	"I knew we were going to be OK to start with. We are a strong family and we are loving and we are positive. I knew it was going to be a difficult road but I knew we were going to be OK.	My son was alive."
THREAD: We worked with the Lamans for a month and I was continuously struck by how strong they are. 	They were so gracious. They could have just said no and we would have understood but that's not who they are. They're open, loving people, and they wanted their son's story told.

@aibarra @therealgloria well I'd argue that what was actually sold is more telling than just # of listings

@HectorinMiami @MiamiHerald Strong dollar, struggle in Latin America, Airbnb, new hotel rooms are all ongoing issues. Trump effect is new

@BSeldin @YourCruiseGuy @MayorLevine Comparing mayor's tweets to Trump's tweets, not Levine to Trump. Lot of similarities (Sad! Fake news!)
@YourCruiseGuy Sure I do. But I care if people read the story, not just the headline and make a judgement call.
@YourCruiseGuy There's a perfectly logical reason I mention Trump, otherwise I wouldn't mention him. But you have to read story for that.
@YourCruiseGuy I don't really care if you read any of my stories or not. But reading just a headline &amp; making a call is not a good practice
@YourCruiseGuy I think I've mentioned Mr. Trump in two stories over the last year. I'd hardly call that an obsession.
@YourCruiseGuy Also encourage you to read story 1st. Mr. Trump's Twitter antics are famous, so making that connection seemed pretty obvious
@YourCruiseGuy he evoked some of the same themes Mr. Trump does in his tweets, "sad!" and "fake news." Nothing more or less than that
