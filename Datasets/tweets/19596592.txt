A7. This great blog post on @MHFirstAidUSA is a great starting point for helping people have conversations about mental health: [https://t.co/7QqBphpacN] #BeTheDifference https://t.co/ilgEQHoX2h
A6. We have to take the lead in talking about mental health openly and honestly. Be conscious of the language you use. Someone is not "bipolar", they are living with bipolar disorder. By educating others, you can #BeTheDifference. https://t.co/ZKLIA9hi9P
A5. Stigma, denial and fear are three of the biggest barriers to talking about our mental health. The stigma must be shattered for us to have productive conversations. #BeTheDifference https://t.co/t17XHWYmUn
A4. Empathetic listening is key! Imagine what it feels like to be that person as you listen and respond accordingly. Be relaxed in your body language and let them know you're truly listening and understanding what they're saying. #BeTheDifference https://t.co/ErwGVhF2Pd
A3. Speak with honesty and empathy while showing that you are sincere. Don't dismiss any feelings they have or tell them they're being irrational or unreasonable. Being a trustworthy ally is key to building rapport. #BeTheDifference https://t.co/1lndkL8OKO
A2. You can start by asking someone "Are you okay?" Explain the behavioral changes you've noticed in them in a non-judgmental way and maintain comfortable eye contact. If you think someone is suicidal, ask if they've thought about suicide. It won't increase risk. #BeTheDifference https://t.co/voB3NsuOU6
A1. Healthy conversations about mental health help us break down the stigma surrounding it and can lead to people getting the treatment they need. The more we talk about it, the more comfortable people are asking for help. #BeTheDifference https://t.co/SL0tGpwFvW
