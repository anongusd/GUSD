I hear so many @lakers fans say they’re torn over LABRON. @kobe said it best- “welcome to the family”. Magic and Kobe are Day 1’s. No one can take their place in the history of the franchise. But more importantly, this is about the “greatest show” returning to its rightful place.

A job that anyone can have if they can tweet! We’re living in some silly times.
But it’s clear that ppl don’t care nor are they held to any standards in the social media world. Killing someone’s character is a crappy job.
I know their heart and I also know they are men and women of integrity and they care deeply about their profession. As a journalist, I’m taught professionally not to jump to conclusions. But I’m human. I have done so in the past.
In this day and age of uninformed-informed” everyone has an opinion, a theory and a hot azz take. But very few know the truth in its entirety. I had this tonight because several ppl I care about remain headlines.

@CuffsTheLegend Game 1
In a game when a vet is trying to take Lonzo out of the game mentally. He appears unbothered. No real emotion. That works in his favor.
Lonzo figuring it out. My expectations are managed BUT I will say this- his BEST quality, IMO, level headed. Doesn't get flustered easily.

Rex Ryan honestly saying he did support Trump and now he's pissed BC he doesn't want ppl to think he agrees with 45's stance on players.
"What about us"- Charles Woodson on Countdown. That's it.
Race makes many uncomfortable. Which is why we find ourselves here today.
Some thought owners wouldn't say anything. But 45 is bad for business- calling for a boycott. Expecting them to address race is hopeful.
I'm not jumping down the throats of these owners who are breaking silence and making statements. In fact, surprised they said anything.
