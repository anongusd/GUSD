Sen. Lugar critiques Trump foreign policy: American leadership essential to national security - READ full remarks https://t.co/iypVclfArf
Lugar: US leverage in global affairs, &amp; therefore our security, is intimately connected to our heroic tradition https://t.co/iypVclfArf
Lugar: “Those nations that do not aspire to a higher ideal lose their claim to greatness” https://t.co/iypVclfArf
Lugar: Trump “should make very clear that US will honor our NATO Article V commitments under all circumstances” https://t.co/iypVclfArf
Lugar: Ambiguity about US commitment to allies “is not clever. It is dangerous &amp; can lead to deadly miscalculation” https://t.co/iypVclfArf
Lugar: “Details of immigration compromise are well understood. This is a political problem, not a technical one" https://t.co/iypVclfArf
Lugar: “The ban on entrants from Muslim countries represents the most obvious recruitment tool against the US since Abu Ghraib”
Lugar: Trump immigration policies “designed for ostentatious symbolism rather than for maximizing U.S. security” https://t.co/iypVclfArf
Lugar to Foreign Policy Association: “On immigration, we are mired in a debate of distraction” https://t.co/iypVclfArf
Lugar: “We doom our workforce to a dismal future if we shift blame to trade and immigrants, instead of attacking the real challenge”
Lugar: Trump foreign policy has been “an exercise in squandering American leverage in favor of campaign-driven themes”
Lugar: Trump’s foreign policy goals normally would be associated with “a selfish, inward looking nation that is being motivated by fear”
Lugar: “the President will learn in time that geopolitical power is not primarily about deal-making or even decision-making”
Lugar:  Trump promised grandiose results, but his foreign policy plans are “lacking in ambition” and “devoid of heroism.”

#AskObama To stimulate job growth we need tax reform. Will you support the FairTax (replacing income & payroll taxes w/ consumption tax)
#AskObama Why do you feel it necessary to criticize Congress for legitimate bipartisan concerns about Libya Civil War and its cost?
Full video of Lugar's Libya floor speech will be posted ASAP at www.youtube.com/senatorlugar. #Libya #Indiana #INsen
I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing adoption of S. J. Res. 20. #Libya
I cannot support the broad mandate that this resolution would give to the President to expand U.S. military activities over Libya.
The Libyan operation siphons attention and resources away from more important national security priorities.
I do not believe that our intervention in the Libyan civil war was prudent in the context of U.S. vital interests.
...allies will be far more confident that the United States will pick up the slack if they withdraw or limit their participation. #Libya
If the President has this broad authorization from Congress in hand...
If Pres Obama is armed w/ this resolution & if the Libyan operation drags on, it's almost inevitable that the U.S. role in Libya will expand
This resolution clearly would give the President the authority to escalate the American role in the bombing campaign.
Even with the success of these amdt's, S. J. Res. 20 remains overly broad, despite its stated purpose of authorizing a limited use of force.
4th, the Committee adopted a sense of the Congress amdt stating that post-war reconstruction costs should be borne by the Libyan people
The SFRC repudiated the Admin’s contention that U.S. ops in Libya don't constitute “hostilities” - aren't subject to the War Powers Res
The President doesn't have authority to substitute judgment for Constitutional process when there is no emergency our vital interests.
This state of affairs is at odds with the President’s own pronouncements on war powers during his presidential candidacy.
The fact that we are leaving most of the shooting to other countries does not mean that the United States is not involved in acts of war.
Defining these actions as something less than hostilities requires extraordinary legal contortions. #Libya
We are using military force to achieve regime change.    #Libya
Three months later, these assurances ring hollow.  #Libya
At the outset of the conflict, the President asserted that U.S. military ops in Libya would be “limited in their nature, duration, & scope.”
This was a fundamental failure of leadership that placed expedience above Constitutional responsibility.
Pres Obama made a deliberate decision not to seek a Congressional auth of his action, either before it commenced or during the last 3 months
Presidents should not be able to avoid Constitutional responsibilities merely bc engaging the people’s Reps is inconvenient or uncertain.
There was no good reason why President Obama should have failed to seek Congressional authorization to go to war in Libya.
... it does not mean that going to war without Congress was either wise or helpful to the operation.
Even if one believes the President somehow had the legal authority to initiate and continue U.S. military operations in Libya....
I believe that it'd be difficult to render a judgment on the Libya operation w/o reference to the process failures that have preceded debate
I understand one can be for the Libya mission, while also being critical of the President’s failure to involve Congress in decision making.
It is an expensive diversion that leaves the United States and our European allies with fewer assets to respond to other contingencies.
American intervention in Libya didn't come as a result of a disciplined assessment of our vital interests or an auth debate in Congress.
Even after Qadhafi leaves power, we will be at risk of substantial costs.
There are many other questions that must be answered in a disciplined examination of whether to go to war.
Saying that American military power in Libya is morally justified is not the same thing as saying it is wise.  #Libya
It's also why Congress has an essential role to play in scrutinizing executive branch rationalizations of wars & their ongoing management.
This is why going to war should be based on U.S. vital interests.
Pres Obama has initiated an expensive, open-ended military commitment in a country that his Defense Sec said is not a vital interest.
We find ourselves in a situation where Congress is debating vast cuts in domestic programs to make essential progress on the deficit
The President has involved our nation in a civil war in Libya.

Lugar: With &gt;180 million people, it is one of the largest Muslim countries in the world & has five times the population of Afghanistan.
Lugar: Pakistan is a nuclear-armed state with missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.
Lugar: Pakistan is not an easy partner.  But distancing ourselves from Pakistan would be unwise and extremely dangerous.

All the Senator Lugar video from today's SFRC hearing on Libya is available at http://www.youtube.com/senatorlugar
Malinowski: This was a nationwide uprising where people were brutally put down. To me, Bosnia was a civil war, this is not.
Lugar questions: When should the United States become involved in the civil war of another country?
W/ 145,000 American troops in Iraq/Afghanistan & yrs of American effort invested in both, they have to be considered a far higher priority
Lugar: We are concerned about potential commitments that would leave the U.S. w/ a large bill for nation building in a post-civil war Libya.
Lugar: A rational strategic assessment would never devote military, diplomatic, economic, & alliance resources to a civil war.
Lugar: "Sustained security issues presented by Iran/Pakistan w/ regards to nuclear capability are much greater than problems posed by Libya.
Lugar on Libya: We're left with a major commitment of military in open-ended conflict backing rebels w/ identity not fully illuminated.

@transparency4us @Saxton777 we'll find out and let you know
That's all for tonight. Check out Senator Lugar's full op-ed in The Hill tomorrow. We'll tweet the link 1st thing in the a.m.
A clear assessment of America’s true national interests in the region is essential so we don’t back into the next war, as we did this one.
The President should also state whether he will seek contributions from oil-rich Arab states, as I urged before the war began.
President must be specific about the costs of this war, who is sharing them& who would be responsible for rebuilding a post-Gadhafi Libya.
Instead, another resolution passed that gave the president alone wide authority to determine the scope/objectives of the war.
Before the 2003 Iraq war, I co-sponsored a bipartisan resolution that would have narrowly defined the mission.
This would've been addressed if Obama sought a declaration of war from Congress as I first urged 2 wks before American missiles launched.
Without saying where the $ would come from the President has committed us to a course that significantly adds to deficit.
The president indicated that he felt backing from Arab League members was key - now some are wavering & we don’t know the impact that has.
The president has committed armed forces to Libya w/o authorization. Important tactical decisions w/o any overriding strategic rationale.
Sen. Lugar will respond to Obama in part in an op-ed in The Hill  tomorrow. Tonight, for our #Twitter followers: a preview.
Lugar also says: Modern tech leads to more food production & our food surplus feeds the world food shortage. This helps Indiana ag economy
During a talk on hunger at Bethany Presbyterian in Lafayette, Lugar says: The world is watching Indiana, hoping for an abundant harvest.
On @meetthepress Lugar stated Congress is debating daily how to spend our money but in a back room we've spent &gt;$1 billion in Libya
On @meetthepress Lugar says if Libya is not in our vital interest we should had a Congressional discussion about the plan. #Libya
On @meetthepress Lugar says before US goes to war or initiates military action we must have a well thought out plan #Libya
Headed to St. Andrews UMC to lead adult Sunday school. Following we'll head to Bethany Presbyterian for a discussion on hunger issues.
Correction: Senator Lugar will be live on NBC's Meet the Press to discuss Libya at 9:15 am today. From Lafayette, IN!

Lugar on Libya in IN: The American public, including me, have no idea who the Libyan rebels are-several in fact fought against us in Iraq.
