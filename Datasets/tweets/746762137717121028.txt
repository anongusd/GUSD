@JackPosobiec Am I getting this right? Your argument isn't "we're legitimate"; it's, "the Republican you appointed sucked, too"?		Aim high, Jack. Aim high.
@bruinsinbc @SarahPalinUSA Please don't take this the wrong way... but FAIR is a known white supremacist organization. It's not a source of legitimate information; it's an ugly firehose of hate and bigotry.		https://t.co/4TZ7OUAPZD
@bruinsinbc @SarahPalinUSA At least for now, we DO vote for whoever we want. That is, those of us who are still allowed to vote. Only one party makes it harder for actual citizens to vote. Why?		https://t.co/8o3vrcMgpv		https://t.co/Px9WvgyUBM
@bruinsinbc @SarahPalinUSA What sort of vetting would you want, beyond the laws that existed pre-Trump? Why does "vetting" include detaining them for months and separating children from parents? That's not vetting; that's terrorism.
@bruinsinbc @SarahPalinUSA See the article I sent. Grant them asylum if they deserve it, make them legal taxpayers, and they CONTRIBUTE to the economy. Trump's policies are CREATING expenses.
@bruinsinbc @SarahPalinUSA Where did you get that number from? The government disagrees.		Please, stick to facts.		https://t.co/dqEh1GSMUG
@RudyGiuliani First, it's Pittsburgh.		Second, until you &amp; your party of thugs denounce @realDonaldTrump every time he incites violence at his rallies or foments hate, your words are empty. You are the divisive problem.		It will take more than praying. You. Must. Act.		https://t.co/tL4jhTvkAM
@bruinsinbc @SarahPalinUSA The usual argument is that we can't let "them" in because "they don't send their best people." That they send terrorists and gang members. If that's not your argument, then I apologize; please correct me.
@bruinsinbc @SarahPalinUSA Open borders? Nope, not at all. I just want us to follow our own laws.		I'd also like to thank you for the discussion. It's unusual to see respectful disagreement on Twitter (or any other social media), but that's what America is supposed to be about. I very much appreciate it.
@bruinsinbc @SarahPalinUSA Agree 100% that the violence must stop.		Did you listen to the things Trump has told his supporters to do at his rallies? Are you old enough to remember the bombings at women's healthcare facilities?		https://t.co/tL4jhTvkAM
@bruinsinbc @SarahPalinUSA That's simply not true. Please: read the law.
@bruinsinbc @SarahPalinUSA Right. So as long as we don't know, let's stick with what we DO know. What we DO have evidence for. Let's start with the facts and go from there.
@bruinsinbc @SarahPalinUSA Show me statistics, please. Find a gov't site that proves it. Forget what the politicians say, &amp; show me how many acts of terror in the US in the last 10 years WEREN'T done by white American men.		Why do you ignore our laws that grant asylum? Read the law:	https://t.co/3a47t8k4LM
@bruinsinbc @SarahPalinUSA On that we agree! But we need to face facts, admit the problems, and move forward. We can't keep promoting bigotry and fear. We can't keep making excuses for politicians‚Äîany of them. And we can't confuse facts with opinions &amp; rhetoric.
@bruinsinbc @SarahPalinUSA I want it to stop everywhere. I don't care who's in charge. But the argument that "they suck, too" is not how we move forward. We need to stop pointing fingers and take responsibility for our actions. Otherwise we just get angrier, and the fascists win.
@bruinsinbc @SarahPalinUSA So now you're arguing conspiracy theories? I get that you're afraid. I get that you're suspicious. But if our country is going to heal, we need to start by acknowledging facts and rejecting lies.		https://t.co/KRBZX6Sogr
@bruinsinbc @SarahPalinUSA First, the people you're talking about are not "sneaking." They're presenting themselves at the border &amp; seeking asylum.		Next, our country has LAWS that grant asylum to people escaping from war zones, terrorist governments, and threats to their safety.		https://t.co/1atM0IBXLs

If only the @GOP had the power to do something. Oh, wait.		https://t.co/vQwNPsqAGs
@FoxNews @GOPChairwoman Sorry, @GOPChairwoman. This is a direct consequence of the hate @realDonaldTrump spreads, and the violence he incites, from the White House, on Twitter, and at every rally.		Until you and your party recognize and put an end to it, your words are insulting. YOU are the problem.
@lisamurkowski When do we get started on the museum for the other things we've killed? Like students, worshipers, and democracy, senator?
@nxthompson Wait, WHAT!? @WIRED needs to screen their editors just a bit more carefully if they expect their audience to take them seriously.
@thehill Apparently, this is EXACTLY who we are. And who we vote for.		Want change? VOTE THEM OUT.
@USArmy Robert Bowers only shot 17 / the entire congregation.		Oh. Not what you meant?		https://t.co/vQwNPsqAGs
@NewMexicoGOP Until you're ready to renounce every statement @realDonaldTrump makes at his rallies, from the White House, or on Twitter, inciting violence and hatred, your words are empty and insulting.		Please, either stop condoning bigotry and racism, or stop embarrassing yourselves.
@grantstern @LouiseMensch @AdamLaxalt That's not how you're supposed to react to gag orders. What are you, new? :)		Oh, and thank you.
@GovMikeHuckabee @donnyosmond @marieosmond @FlamingoVegas Thank you for not pretending you're appalled and astounded by the horror in Pittsburgh. Go whoop it up while your party takes @NRA money, disenfranchises American citizens, and literally kills its constituents.
@SenShelby If you're not just posturing, you can start by calling out your party leaders every time they foment hate and incite violence: from the White House and Capitol Hill, on Twitter, &amp; at their rallies.		Otherwise your words are empty and insulting. THIS IS YOUR JOB, SENATOR.
@UnimpressedTX @ddale8 That seems like a lifetime ago. Sadly, for some folks, it was.
@SandaBlue I'm amazed at the number of @GOP politicians making "heartfelt" statements condemning the shooting... and happily supporting @realDonaldTrump as he incites violence at every one of his rallies. It's a tiny bit of a consolation to see All. Those. Replies. calling them out on it.
@ddale8 @UnimpressedTX What happened the week of Sept. 16? Did he have laryngitis AND lose his Twitter password?

@normcoleman What will it take? It will take you and your colleagues to call out @realDonaldTrump every time he makes a racist tweet, or incites violence at his rallies, or deflects well-deserved blame.		Until then, you're just posturing, your words are empty, and you're complicit.
@RepStephenLynch Please encourage your colleagues across the aisle to take the issue up with their leaders. So many of them echo your words but defend a chief executive who divides our country and incites violence at every rally.		Someone needs to be the adult. Will it be you?
@paulrevolution_ @RepWalberg @realDonaldTrump I absolutely WILL criticize Pelosi, Waters, or anyone else the moment they ask their supporters to physically assault their opponents. ESPECIALLY if they demand unconditional support from law enforcement and condone violence against civilians.
@sendavidperdue Strong words from a man whose entire party is happy to let its leader continue to foment hate and incite violence from the White House, on Twitter, and at every rally.		You weren't elected to pray. You were elected to keep us safe. Will you?		https://t.co/vQwNPsqAGs
@RepWalberg If only there were something we could do about it.		https://t.co/vQwNPsqAGs
@RepWalberg How do you reconcile your words with the fact that your entire party sits by while @realDonaldTrump continues to incite hatred and violence on Twitter, from the White House, and at every rally?		If you mean what you say, THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING about it.

@MalcolmNance @RosenforNevada Vote like this is our last election... or else it will be.
@sheLLbeLL_xo @realDonaldTrump The number of @GOP members who are denouncing today's shooting is astounding, considering approximately ZERO of them have anything to say about their leader's constant incitement to hatred and violence. #Hypocrite much?
@RodneyDavis If only the party that controlled the House, the Senate, and the Oval Office could actually do something about the level of violence that occurs nowhere else on the planet.		https://t.co/vQwNPsIby0
@RodneyDavis Here's a challenge: stop posturing and start publicly denouncing anyone who incites hatred or calls for violence. Especially at political rallies. And if they live at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.		Until then, please, just stop.
@SchuetteOnDuty @MIGOP Your words are empty as long as you and your party continue to tolerate your chief executive's incitements to hatred and violence.		You control the House. You control the Senate. Your candidate is in the White House. Are you all impotent, or hypocrites?		https://t.co/vQwNPsqAGs

@MarshaBlackburn How about you stop posturing and DO SOMETHING about it? Until you and your colleagues stand up to your chief executive and call him out every time he incites hatred and violence, do your constituents a favor: Just. Shut. Up.

@jahimes @StephanieforCT If you knock on the door and bring thin mints, you just might find yourself some lifetime supporters.
@RoseResists214 You have more power than most realize. Everything about rape culture depends on the virtual guarantee--until now--that you'll (collective) keep silent. #MeToo brings that all crumbling down. I'm so sorry this happened to you. Kudos for turning it into a superpower.

@HoarseWisperer So you're saying the lesson worked. :)
@Tmanlee222 @carolmswain @Carolaps7 @realDonaldTrump Sorry, what? It's the FBI's job to vet SCOTUS nominees. This isn't a criminal investigation; it's a background check. You just wrote that yourself. Their job is to uncover all the relevant information to the nominee's background. New information requires additional investigation.
@7blacklabs @trumpsterst Mark Judge under oath? Really? Link?		She (1) passed a polygraph, (2) will testify under oath Thursday, (3) wants the FBI to investigate. Doesn't sound like a liar to me. But it'd be easier to know if the Cmte or WH allowed witnesses and an investigation.
@7blacklabs @trumpsterst Yes, he does have rights, and that's exactly why we need an investigation and testimony from Judge: he deserves the opportunity to clear his name with evidence and sworn testimony.
@senorrinhatch @greggnunziata So set the record straight now. Let the FBI investigate, let the other witnesses testify, subpoena Judge, and make all the evidence available in an open hearing.		If Kavanaugh's telling the truth, let us see him vindicated.
@carolmswain @Carolaps7 @realDonaldTrump Then why not let the FBI investigate and vindicate him?
@Just_SomeChick @LouiseMensch @dcherring @RadioFreeTom @MelissaJPeltier @snowknuckles @ecker_recipes @thespybrief @DrDenaGrayson @GOP I see that after reading the entire thread; thanks, and sorry for making the assumption based on the 1 tweet in my stream.

@Just_SomeChick @LouiseMensch @dcherring @RadioFreeTom @MelissaJPeltier @snowknuckles @ecker_recipes @thespybrief @DrDenaGrayson @GOP Please tell me you're not claiming that being drunk is an excuse to force yourself on someone.
@7blacklabs @trumpsterst Cut the ad-hominem. This isn't a trial; it's a confirmation for a lifetime appointment, and the Senate is already imposing arbitrary rules and attacking her. The outcome isn't "innocent" or "guilty" here‚Äîit's "true" or "false."
@7blacklabs @trumpsterst Most say they don't remember, not that it didn't happen. I don't remember who was at parties I went to, either. But I wasn't assaulted there.		She IS willing to go under oath, Thursday. Mark Judge is not.		What's redacted? Names of other witnesses who'd be attacked?
@7blacklabs @trumpsterst Sorry for what happened to you, and hope you've taken good care of yourself.		What's unreasonable about it? Why would she want an investigation (which could be done by Thursday) if she's lying? 		Where's evidence she's trying to take Trump down?		https://t.co/phDDESvqBa
@EllenKurz @AdamParkhomenko I'd rather have a strong showing of support for her INSIDE the Senate, but you do the best with what you have.
@GOP Thanks, but I'll STAND UP FOR AMERICA and show my American spirit in November.
@7blacklabs @trumpsterst And why would she invent a story, knowing full well it would make her and her family targets of attacks and death threats? Who has more incentive to lie?
@7blacklabs @trumpsterst Why is she the one who wants an investigation? Given the cmte's attacks (and Graham's already-made decision), who in their right mind would tell them first?
@7blacklabs @trumpsterst Or hers is. Why do you believe her over Ford?
@LizMair Excellent. Now let the other witnesses testify, and support a thorough investigation to clear Kavanaugh's name.
@7blacklabs @trumpsterst Again: not a denial that the attack happened.
@jasoninthehouse They seemed pretty negotiable when @SenateMajLdr decided not to vote on a SCOTUS nominee at all. #Hypocrite #Liar #Shameful #VotingInNovember

@susanmreif @Draycomaster @senorrinhatch @FBI @senjudiciary @GOP @DNC @SenFeinstein @realDonaldTrump Too late to ensure we're appointing the right person to SCOTUS for life??? I hope our Senators have clearer heads than that. There. Is. No. Hurry.
@HoarseWisperer One can only hope. But I'm still pretty sure this isn't the Good Place.
@susanmreif @Draycomaster @senorrinhatch @FBI @senjudiciary @GOP @DNC @SenFeinstein So fix that: open hearings, all witnesses, after independent investigation.
@susanmreif @Draycomaster @senorrinhatch @FBI @senjudiciary @GOP Why not let the evidence vindicate Kavanaugh? He deserves due process.

@NakedAxiom @realDonaldTrump He may be telling the truth. He didn't say they were record highs.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/qOlJCzcy2z
@HouseGOP @thehill Sure, because we have a racist, narcissistic, lying sex offender in the White House and a self-serving, misogynist, lying Congress.		Which would YOU be more concerned about?		https://t.co/qOlJCzcy2z
@Draycomaster @susanmreif @senorrinhatch Do yourself a favor and read about what Congress and the public did to Anita Hill. That would make Ford even less likely to come forward unless she's telling the truth.		It's the FBI's *job* to investigate nominees. It's the Senate's *job* to know the whole truth before a vote.
@Draycomaster @susanmreif @senorrinhatch If that were true, why aren't thousands accusing him publicly? Why is she asking for an investigation? Why is the GOP imposing arbitrary deadlines and trying to rush K to the bench? Why don't they want him vindicated?		Does she have a reputation for being underhanded? Do they?
@Draycomaster @susanmreif @senorrinhatch Yes: due process. Let her testify. Let the witnesses testify. Let an investigation uncover the truth. If she's lying, let America see it. If Kavanaugh's telling the truth, let him be vindicated.		"My side" is the American public. I want the truth.
@cathymcmorris Nope.		https://t.co/qOlJCzcy2z

@Draycomaster @susanmreif @senorrinhatch Agreed. But that's not that's going on here. Why would a professor come forward when she KNEW the result would devastate her career, her life, and her family? Please read #WhyIDidntReport.
@SenWarren @SenMajLdr @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Innocent people don't try to conceal the facts or shut their accusers up.		But Trump did.	And Cohen did.	And Manafort did.	And Moore did.		I'm starting to see a pattern.
@lisamurkowski Senator, please vote to ensure these beautiful children grow up in a country where they control their own bodies and sexual predators don't hold office. Thank you for putting America first.
@SarahPalinUSA Now explain your position on Kavanaugh. And Moore. And Trump.
@abeodulce @senorrinhatch And lose a SCOTUS seat just because yet ANOTHER of Trump's "best people" might be a sex offender? HELL, NO!!! #GOPValues
@calistitcher1 @senorrinhatch That would be age discrimination. There are plenty of sharp, experienced, competent octogenarians and beyond, and frankly, we NEED leadership with a memory that goes back beyond a decade or two.		If anything, I'd like to require a basic understanding of science.
@TamaraP1992 @senorrinhatch What's the rush? Why not investigate and hear testimony for all the witnesses, to prove Kavanaugh's telling the truth?
@susanmreif @senorrinhatch I'm happy that you've never been a victim of sexual assault, but please read a few dozen #WhyIDidntReport accounts.		Ford _knew_ she would put herself and her family at risk by coming forward. Why would anyone put themselves and their family through that if she were lying?
@emerdave @senorrinhatch @instapundit The only "changing demands" are the artificial deadlines imposed by a party that doesn't want to hear the truth. Let the investigation collect evidence. Let all the witnesses testify. If Kavanaugh's telling the truth, let America know.
@HouseGOP @cathymcmorris Of COURSE you do. Otherwise you'd only have each other to sexually assault.

@disneydoc911 @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @SecAzar You have no idea how much I want you to be right on this.
@disneydoc911 @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @SecAzar Based on Trump's interactions with Vets, victims, and the public in general, doing rounds with him would be pointless. He's always right, everyone else is wrong and at fault, and information is fake news. You'll have better results with someone who's teachable and has empathy.
@disneydoc911 @Alyssa_Milano Part of the ACA problem is that it depended on federal funding, which has been gutted. It wasn't "the" answer, but it was a step in the right direction ... if it'd been allowed to evolve as it was intended.		Networks are an insurance invention: how little payment will you accept?
@disneydoc911 @Alyssa_Milano Apologies for the pharma perks comment; I'm admittedly out of date and happy to hear the laws have changed. Still, big pharma is part of the problem, too. They need incentive to innovate, but compared to 30 or 40 years ago, we overmedicate horrifically.
@disneydoc911 @Alyssa_Milano That's exactly my point. As a physician, you've lost the freedom to practice medicine as your training and experience would direct. You're beholden to companies that net billions in profit each year. Think about how that money could be better spent.
@disneydoc911 @Alyssa_Milano How many people forgo wellness checks if they're not covered? What if you want an MRI but insurance covers only ultrasound? What if the Rx med isn't on the formulary? What if your #1 specialist is out of network?
@disneydoc911 @Alyssa_Milano I'm not trolling; I'm serious. I'm the son of a physician who worked in both the manufacturing and insurance industries since the '60s. If you accept insurance, then either you or your patients negotiate (or have negotiated) every time they visit you.
@disneydoc911 @Alyssa_Milano How would your diagnostic and treatment plans differ if you weren't offered perks for prescribing as the pharma reps requested, or if you didn't need to negotiate with insurance companies? Would your patients be better or worse off?
@disneydoc911 @Alyssa_Milano First we need to do away with for-profit healthcare. Any system that offers incentives for cutting corners is doomed to fail. How many countries have tried universal healthcare and then decided it was a bad idea and did away with it?
@cathymcmorris And how does that compare to inflation and healthcare costs? What does it do to the national debt? If you're going to crow, please tell the whole story instead of parroting partisan politics.		https://t.co/rAKO1G6cRU
@WendellEdwards @SenatorCantwell No, I mean that buildings are standing vacant while human beings are on the street. Owners pay taxes but collect no rent, vandals destroy property, and everyone loses. Stop snarking and think about win-win situations that might actually help people.
@disneydoc911 @Alyssa_Milano Yes, healthcare professionals were respected before the industry put profit over healthcare. Most LEO were respected before cell phones, body cameras, and social media exposed rampant corruption. Most LEO are not corrupt, and most doctors still care about health. Still we suffer.

@DeplorableNew @SheriffClarke Seriously, watch the video. Remember Trump claimed voter fraud and elections rigged by politicians? Trump denigrated our elections, same way he does the intelligence agencies. And millions of desperate, angry Americans still believe his lies.
@DeplorableNew @SheriffClarke What power? Social. Economic. Media. He duped a bit less than half of America into believing his lies and voting for him. Including you, apparently.		Is that the same video? Please WATCH. The caption is wrong: Obama never mentions Russia. Trump said Clinton rigged the election.
@DeplorableNew @SheriffClarke "I'm not defensive!" Really?	Did I excuse Obama? Don't think so.	Obama DID take action; why do you think there was an investigation?	Trump had PLENTY of power. Just listen to yourself. He's got you wrapped around his finger ... when did that happen: before or after the election?
@DeplorableNew @SheriffClarke The current accusations are that Russia provided illegal funds, purchased advertising, and flooded social media with bots. Those things have been proven; there's no question about them. I don't recall anyone saying Russia manipulated votes after they were cast.
@DeplorableNew @SheriffClarke Huh. Did you actually watch that video? I just did. No mention of Russia. If you remember the context, Trump had been complaining that Clinton was rigging the election, and that "millions of people" were committing voter fraud AT THE POLLs. Obama denied that. And he was right.
@DeplorableNew @SheriffClarke No, no excuses. What part of "Obama told Trump about it" is so hard to understand? Russian interference in American democracy isn't supposed to be a partisan issue. I'm not defending anyone, just giving you facts.		No need to be so defensive.
@senjudiciary @reviewjournal @POTUS ‚ÄúNo president has ever consulted more widely, or talked with more people from more backgrounds, to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination.‚Äù		His first statement to the public as a nominee was a Trump-induced lie. How can we trust him to be impartial in SCOTUS?
@OldielocksNmo4 @SheriffClarke It really IS impossible for you to put a sentence together w/o mentioning Clinton, Obama, or Democrats. Focus, friend. Don't deflect.		For the record, Obama did tell Trump, Jan 6, 2016, before the inauguration. Trump said he wouldn't tell the public.		https://t.co/TTZkJm2khI
@DeplorableNew @SheriffClarke It really IS impossible for you to have a discussion without mentioning Clinton, Obama, or Democrats, isn't it? Focus, friend, focus.		To answer: Same reason. You need to protect an ongoing investigation. But Obama DID tell Trump, and Trump kept it quiet.		https://t.co/TTZkJm2khI
@SheriffClarke Yes, "only now," David. You don't broadcast the evidence during an ongoing investigation. You really don't know much about law enforcement for a sheriff, do you?
@SheriffClarke Let me spell it out for you, Sheriff: the 30+ indictments show that Russia interfered materially in American elections and illegally provided money to the campaigns. As an alleged law-enforcement officer, surely you're familiar with the way prosecution builds a case, no?
@SteveScalise Agreed, 100%. Please suggest the same to @POTUS.
@DrDenaGrayson @YvettaBarbee @GOP @marcorubio Pretty sure #HeisenPage is a direct consequence of the #QuantumEntanglementMike Pence theory.		https://t.co/puTMsmX4AR
@Ostrov_A @KyleKashuv @IDFSpokesperson Let me get this straight: @realDonaldTrump told Jordan to open their borders to accept #Syrian #AsylumSeekers? #CantMakeThisUp
@RepMiaLove Fantastic! #ThanksObama https://t.co/5D8fwneNAC
@RepJayapal @amjoyshow Thank you for shining daylight on this. I hope you have photos and videos, and that you're taking names. Defending our borders is one thing; violating the rights of human beings seeking asylum is just racism disguised as patriotism.
@kenmulhearn @KyleKashuv Because it's perfectly reasonable and there's no reason for @MattxRed to lie.		Also, for the conspiracy theorists, there's video.		https://t.co/6yIXvdj7mi
@bschmitmeyer14 @ebpofx @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Again with Obama, with a bonus of asking me to do your research for you and a deflection to Israel.		I can't tell if you honestly can't focus or you're a troll.		Either way, I'm done. Enjoy your conspiracy theories.
@RyanAFournier @TrumpStudents @SenatorBrakey @WizzardofAHHS At least he's honest about giving the public a song and dance.
@JennDeGruchy @bschmitmeyer14 @DonaldJTrumpJr When did adultery become a partisan issue?
@bschmitmeyer14 @meowmix67 @DonaldJTrumpJr Why is it impossible for you to have a discussion without mentioning Clinton? I don't see Clinton in the photo. I don't see Clinton talking about family values on this page.		I'm a classic liberal!!! because I'm against adultery? Well, ok, then.
@bschmitmeyer14 @meowmix67 @DonaldJTrumpJr And, exactly as expected, without mentioning Hillary, Obama, or Democrats, you have no argument.		I didn't think adultery was a partisan issue.
@sweenprs @KyleKashuv Both groups organized online, and @MattxRed's post has gone viral. Which of his claims do you not believe?
There can be only one @GeorgeTakei! https://t.co/1qDA1hn3gU
@Joeyrebar @bschmitmeyer14 @DonaldJTrumpJr No, you will NEVER stop with the Clinton comments. Trump should build a wall from her emails, because you can never get over them.		(Also, I thought good Christians like Pence were against adultery. No?)
@bschmitmeyer14 @meowmix67 @DonaldJTrumpJr As a matter of fact, I'm very much NOT a fan of Hillary. Sorry to squash your deflection, my friend.
@bschmitmeyer14 @DonaldJTrumpJr Can just ONE of you try to put a coherent argument together without using the words Clinton, Obama, or Democrat? Whatever does Clinton have to do with this? Pretty sure @DonaldJTrumpJr didn't sleep with her. (Cue the attacks on Clinton in 3 ... 2 ... 1 ...)
@sweenprs @KyleKashuv That's probably why all the counter-protesters denied it... oh, wait.		Also: go back and re-read your comment. You wrapped yourself around your own sentence and came out the other end upside-down.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Great family tradition! Just like sleeping around on your wife, amirite?

@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Can you possibly put together a sentence without using the words Obama, Clinton, or Democrats?
@realDonaldTrump Rigged with hunt that's racked up 13 indictments, 5 guilty pleas, and a prison sentence because it's trying to keep Russia out of our elections.		What, exactly, is your problem?
@right_americas @KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 I'm sorry, help me understand: what statement are you talking about?
@right_americas @KyleKashuv @davidhogg111 You've read it? Then why are you still talking about disarming people?
@mindychaffee @GovMikeHuckabee It's true, isn't it? You can't put together an argument without mentioning Obama, Clinton, or Democrats, can you? What we're doing to human beings at the border is an abomination. Stop deflecting.
@GovMikeHuckabee And yours believes it's okay to rip babies from their mothers' [note: plural possessive] arms and put them in cages.		You disgust me.

@CAgoldennomore @SarahPalinUSA Note, also, that attorney-client privilege DOES NOT APPLY to evidence that was used in the commission of a crime. If you phone your atty and say you robbed a bank, the recording is NOT privileged.
@CAgoldennomore @SarahPalinUSA Here's how the law works:		1. Judge issues specific search warrant for Cohen's office based on probable cause.	2. FBI collects evidence.	3. Cohen's lawyers claim atty-client priv for some of the docs.	4. Another judge decides which docs are protected.	5. FBI gets the others.
@1deserthottie @SarahPalinUSA Of COURSE a warrant isn't open-ended. He actually had to go to a judge, present enough evidence to establish probable cause, and ask for warrants specifically to search Cohen's home, office, and hotel.		Where did you get the idea he used one warrant for everything? #NotHowItWorks
@EvonS777 29+ indictments	 5    guilty pleas	 1    jail sentence
@DrStefool @SenTomCotton @POTUS You would? Why did they access the Senate computers? How many CIA agents were charged with misconduct?		You owe it to yourself to learn all the facts and make truly informed decisions.
@HolliCarr4 @VP @POTUS So you're comparing $16T at Trump's rate to $10T at Obama's. Your point?
@SarahPalinUSA If only he knew the difference between a legal search, pursuant to a legally-obtained search warrant, and a rutabaga.
@VP @POTUS ...and added $1 TRILLION to the national debt in the last 6 months.
@MIGOP @politico Will the @GOP confirm a liar?		‚ÄúNo president has ever consulted more widely, or talked with more people from more backgrounds, to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination.‚Äù
@senjudiciary @bostonherald His very first statement was a lie: ‚ÄúNo president has ever consulted more widely, or talked with more people from more backgrounds, to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination.‚Äù		Really? Is that how he'll make SCOTUS decisions, too?
@marcorubio I wonder what would happen if you posted quotes from the Constitution instead of the Bible.
@DrStefool @SenTomCotton @POTUS No, they're not political anything; they're career intelligence officers, and there are entire organizations of dedicated Americans behind them.		Putin is playing Trump for a fool and winning. Trump is playing you for a fool and winning. Every other sentence from Trump is a lie.
@DrStefool @SenTomCotton @POTUS That remains to be seen. Let's not make any final decisions until all the evidence comes out.		Netanyahu has a different relationship w/Putin than the USA; don't change the subject. Which other POTUS has supported Putin and Kim Jong Un over their own intelligence agencies?
@DrStefool @SenTomCotton @POTUS Let's circle back on this in a few months after some more indictments come out, shall we?
@SenTomCotton Too busy worrying about the connections between @POTUS and the Kremlin.

@MIGOP The protests were real. His statements were real. What part are you talking about?
@carolinabluness @Education4Libs @pam_baldridge @POTUS That's there are intelligence agencies, public hearings, and due process. We'll never get all the facts. But we will get evidence, and lots of it. I'm confident it will form a logical, consistent, verifiable explanation.		On another note: thank you for the honest conversation.
@carolinabluness @Education4Libs @pam_baldridge @POTUS Thank you. It's not a partisan issue; it's an #American issue. That's why I don't understand why anyone WOULDN'T want to see all the facts. We need to know what #Russia did, and how, and with whom, so we can stop it from happening again. It's not about blame; it's about process.
@carolinabluness @Education4Libs @pam_baldridge @POTUS You're absolutely right that just saying it doesn't make it true. Show me #Facts and I'll change my mind. There's plenty of documentation of Russian support for Trump.		Link to unbiased website, please?

@RepRoybalAllard @RepJayapal @RepTerriSewell @RepDeSaulnier @JacksonLeeTX18 @janschakowsky @RepKarenBass @JuliaBrownley26 Thank you for shining daylight on our government's treatment of human beings. Voters need real information if we're going to make the right decisions.
@tenareten70 @kwilli1046 Flynn pleaded guilty to a crime he actually committed. There's no denying the evidence. There's a similar amount of evidence against crimes that Manafort actually committed, including witness tampering. You rarely see federal indictments that don't bear fruit.
@kwilli1046 @pam_baldridge Once all the witnesses testify and the evidence is gathered, I expect to see may more indictments. Remember, you don't often see a federal indictment unless the prosecutor truly expects to win based on overwhelming evidence.		I fully believe the swamp will be drained.
@kwilli1046 @pam_baldridge There's plenty of evidence that's been gathered but not yet released. I have faith in the US intelligence agencies.
@GaetaSusan @pam_baldridge @realDonaldTrump @VP @tedcruz @DonaldJTrumpJr @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity How cool--I don't believe in coincidences, either!
@kwilli1046 @pam_baldridge Yes, keep hoping and praying. The rest of us will use #Facts and #Action ... and guess who always wins?
@carolinabluness @Education4Libs @pam_baldridge @POTUS TBH, I'd rather stop trying to look backwards and place blame. I'd rather we stop spreading lies and focus on what matters: Russia is interfering with our elections, buying politicians, and injecting chaos through social media. If we don't focus on that, they'll continue to win.
@carolinabluness @Education4Libs @pam_baldridge @POTUS Based on the facts provided by every US intelligence agency (and by Putin in Finland), there is no question that Russia wanted Trump to win.		Your "fact" is a lie from Putin. That's what he does. And apparently he's very, very good at it.		https://t.co/Px8u9MNIin
@LittleLee527 @pam_baldridge @NYGovCuomo I can't tell you how much I respect your answer. If only we all would build our opinions based on real research, we might have a real conversation and move the country forward. Thank you.		The ACA depended on the gov't funding that was cut in 2017.
@Education4Libs @pam_baldridge No, the RESPONSIBILITY belongs to @POTUS. That is literally his job. Trump knew on Jan 6, 2017 that Russia was attacking us, but since the attacks were in his favor he ignored it. And he CONTINUES to insist that "Putin is fine."		#FactsMatter
@gbroh10 @pam_baldridge That's an awful lot of words to say, "Trump believes Putin over his own intelligence agencies."
@MIGOP @gretchenwhitmer Meanwhile, the @GOP just adds to the #NationalDebt.
@MIGOP Forget "access" to healthcare. Just PROVIDE THE HEALTHCARE.
@RepMikeBishop @WaysandMeansGOP If folks like YOU don't pay their fair share, the #NationalDebt will climb beyond the additional $TRILLION since #POTUS took office.
@seanspicer @seanhannity @FoxNews Is it available in the original Russian?
@LittleLee527 @pam_baldridge @NYGovCuomo Good question. But do we really want to make it affordable to the middle class, or do we want to maintain a caste system of haves and have-nots? Because as long as we have for-profit insurance companies and tie healthcare to employment, most of us are out of luck.
@SteveScalise @seanhannity @FoxNews Will you be speaking Russian?
@LindseyGrahamSC @CBSEveningNews @POTUS The most constructive action you can take is to honor your oath to support the Constitution and stop making excuses for Trump.

@TrumpStudents @thewillwitt #BLM doesn't mean black lives are more important than anyone else's. It's not some deranged competition. It means they're _equally_ important. No one's saying police officers' lives are any less important. But #BlueLivesMatter seems to imply blue is somehow more important.
@TrumpStudents @thewillwitt If only police officers could take off their uniforms when their shifts were over, or if a different, safer line of work were available to those who don't want to be targets, just as black people can change their skin color at will.		Oh, wait.		#BLM means black lives matter, too.

@abbott_wolf @FoxNews @POTUS Who ever said that? Don't put words in my mouth, and I won't put them in yours. But to be clear:		&gt;&gt; Saying "57" when you mean "50" = error. (Do you honestly believe he thought there were 57 states?)		&gt;&gt; Saying "I met with parents of Korean War vets" = intentional lie.
@GovWalker And the national deficit, @GovWalker? The money has to come from somewhere.
@abbott_wolf @FoxNews @POTUS Dude, seriously. Yes, everyone makes mistakes. Is lying about visiting vets' parents an "oops, mistake" in your book?
@abbott_wolf @FoxNews @POTUS But seriously: do the math. Then tell me @POTUS "accidentally" misspoke about meeting parents of Korean War vets.
@abbott_wolf @FoxNews @POTUS When you're done with the math, look up psychological projection. This isn't about Obama. It's about @POTUS who doesn't understand the law, thinks the Constitution is "inconvenient," and can't keep his own cabinet together.
@JustCML22 @PAGOP @GOP Who said anything about armed robbery? Most of these are families fleeing, literally, for their lives. Google Guatemala.		Also, read the law.		https://t.co/pw3aG3PuMR
@abbott_wolf @FoxNews @POTUS When did the Korean War end?  #BadAtMath
@abbott_wolf @FoxNews @POTUS No, he misspoke, and he admitted it. @POTUS, on the other hand, said he met with parents of Korean War vets.		#BadAtMath #BadAtTruth
@MollyJongFast You silly! A cult would blindly follow their leader, deny what they've seen with their own eyes, invent their own narrative to explain their delusions, and ...		Oh.
@TrumpStudents What could POSSIBLY go wrong?
@SenGillibrand Thank you, Senator, for working so hard to treat these children and their families like humans, rather than criminals. And when the dust settles, please see that those responsible are held accountable.
@rush4141 @IP_Mason @BreitbartNews @realDonaldTrump You're absolutely right: there is no law that compels him to release his returns the the American public. But there should also be no reason NOT to release them, as long as he has nothing to hide. Show us why we should believe you, @POTUS.
@rush4141 @IP_Mason @BreitbartNews @realDonaldTrump 2. I want to know where the money came from and how it was spent. If he's truly uninvolved with Russia, his tax returns will show that, once and for all. No dealings with shell companies, no payments to settle lawsuits or keep people quiet, no questionable foreign transactions.
@rush4141 @IP_Mason @BreitbartNews @realDonaldTrump Why does solvency matter? Because someone with a billionaire reputation to uphold who needs money is a prime target for bribery or blackmail. Which brings us to:
@rush4141 @IP_Mason @BreitbartNews @realDonaldTrump 1. He says he's a billionaire and brags about the amount of money he makes. If he's telling the truth, his returns would prove it. I don't care if he's a billionaire, a millionaire, or just comfortable. I care whether on not he's telling the truth, and whether he's solvent.
@rush4141 @IP_Mason @BreitbartNews @realDonaldTrump I would LOVE to have a genuine conversation about this. Frankly I don't care how much he made, and I believe his accountants made sure he paid the taxes he owes.		Here are the things I'm concerned about:
@rush4141 @IP_Mason @BreitbartNews @realDonaldTrump What other president was ashamed to show #America his tax returns? If everything he's been saying is true, what's to hide? Is he worth what he says he is, or is that a lie? Where did the money come from? Where did he spend it?		We'll find out soon enough.
@RepDonBacon Wow, 243 years, and it's only NOW that we've discovered a problem. Please stop flaunting your #bigotry as if it were #patriotism. Oh, and Google the 442nd Infantry while you're at it. Learn from history.		#BigotryIsNotPatriotism
@JustCML22 Send them where? BTW: they're not illegal. Here's the law.		https://t.co/pw3aG3PuMR
@JustCML22 @PAGOP @GOP So you're saying you're actually in favor of separating children from their parents and keeping them locked up for months on end? Didn't your parents ever say they didn't care who started it; just stop it?
@howard317 @IP_Mason @BreitbartNews @realDonaldTrump @CivilRights @TheDemocrats 1. Why hasn't the @GOP-controlled Congress followed up on this? Where's the court order to declare it unconstitutional?		2. Why is @realDonaldTrump the only president in decades who refuses to tell #America what he's actually worth, where his money came from, and how he spent it?
@IP_Mason @BreitbartNews Far less important than @realDonaldTrump's tax returns. Let's put the #law above #bigotry, shall we?
@PamCallan @thehill They follow both the #Bible and the #Constitution, and both in the same way: they choose the parts that work for them and ignore the inconvenient ones about love and honesty and decency.
@lid_lucy @debpettit Ask yourself this: why would the most powerful man on the planet need you to think all of our allies, the media, and most of his own government--in fact, everyone who says a word against him--is corrupt, but that he is above the law?		What kind of leaders have done this?
@lid_lucy @debpettit Fake news? Really? He JUSTIFIED saying it on national TV.		https://t.co/bSnoPzCQhD
@dbongino Clinton: investigated for TWO YEARS, not one conviction.	Manafort: tampered with witnesses. Violated conditions of bail. 37 related indictments, 5 guilty pleas.		#Strawman
@JeffMast55 @MagamanComics @EricTrump @GOP Why would he work so hard to keep Americans so angry at each other that we can't even have a civil conversation anymore?		What sort of leaders have done that in the past? What was their goal?
@JeffMast55 @MagamanComics @EricTrump @GOP Why would the leader of the party that controls BOTH houses of Congress want to to think everything--everything--is unfair? In what used to be the most powerful position on the planet, why would he resort to name-calling? Why reduce trust in his own gov't?
@JeffMast55 @MagamanComics @EricTrump @GOP Ask yourself this: why would someone want you to believe the FBI, the CIA, the DOJ, the press, and the leader of every foreign ally are corrupt ... and that the leaders of North Korea and Russia are trustworthy?		When has that happened--ever--in the entire history of the US?
@JeffMast55 @MagamanComics @EricTrump @GOP You mean the acting director that Trump appointed?	Last I checked there was no DOG. Oh, do you mean Sessions, another Trump appointee?
@JeffMast55 @MagamanComics @EricTrump And, yet, even though the @GOP controls BOTH houses, they found no wrongdoing. Why? Because there were no actual crimes, or because the @GOP is incompetent?
@jacksonryder36 @EricTrump Obama: 8 yrs in office. 0 indictments. 0 convictions.	Trump: 1 yr. in office. 17 indictments. 5 guilty pleas. 118 appointees fired or resigned.		#MAGA #BestPresidentEver #SoMuchWinning

@EricTrump 3000 children without their parents.	0 ideas how to reunite them.	118 appointees gone from the administration.		Hooray, #KeepingChildrenInCages party!
@MarkMorganWI @wisgop @LeahVukmir Let's not vote for the Keeping Children in Cages party this November.
@USCIS It's 2018. What kind of web site goes down for 13 hours at a time, for "scheduled maintenance"?
@wisgop @tammybaldwin @LeahVukmir Let's not vote for the Keeping Children in Cages party in November.
@NateSilver538 Are they wrong?
@RepTomMacArthur Why does your letter differ from reports we're hearing from other representatives, senators, and officials, who say we STILL don't know which children belong with which parents?
@Mrs_Tande Re: puppies and babies and cages, I'm with you, 100%. But I'm not in his district and can't vote him out. And replying with anger and hate makes me "just another libtard." So I did my best to turn his innocent post to a respectful attention-getter. Seemed to work. :)
@stabenow Please keep working hard, until you can say the same about the water in #Flint.
@RepScottPeters Thank you for supporting Americans and those who would earn their citizenship. Will there be legislation to prevent this from ever happening again?
@BillPascrell Honest question: do these tweets help? Do they change people's minds? What can those of us who are far from the borders, sitting behind our keyboards, do today, right now, to help you help these families?
@RepDianaDeGette @SecAzar @HHSGov Thank you, on behalf of everyone who still believes in America.
@DonBald1 @RepDianaDeGette @DonBald1 why do you think parents from, say, Guatemala brought their children here? Honest question.
@LogicalPolitic2 @RepRoybalAllard Erm ... the original post was about stopping the actual mistreatment of children, today, that our government is fighting to continue. You chastised her for it. What reaction did you expect? And now you're too hurt to discuss it?
@LogicalPolitic2 @RepRoybalAllard If you truly "love a good political discussion for the purpose of learning," then I'm game. Happy to discuss and learn, respectfully, if you are.
@LogicalPolitic2 @RepRoybalAllard Sorry, what do you think is happening to the kids we take away from their parents? Are you ok with that?		I care much, much less about people's feelings than I do about the health and well-being of their children. It's not about feelings. It's about actual, genuine, facts.
@LogicalPolitic2 @RepRoybalAllard "Well within the law"? Then why are there court orders to stop?		Totally agree that this Congress and administration are, overall, an embarrassment. Nobody complains more and does less than @POTUS.
@RepRoybalAllard Thank you. Please continue to work to reunite these kids with their families, and to join your colleagues to pass legislation that never allows this to happen again.
@LogicalPolitic2 @RepRoybalAllard If the policy is based on law, why have the courts overturned his policies again ... and again ... and again? No one who thinks it's ok to separate children from their parents and keep them in cages should call themselves "Logical" or American.
@RepLloydDoggett I wonder if anyone in our administration remembers the 442nd Infantry. Thank you for your voice. Please keep reminding your colleagues that immigrants keep America strong.
@KristinMinkDC Just a quick note to let you know you're my new hero. :) Thank you for standing up for your child, and for what's right.
@RepCummings Thank you for working to help these children. America needs to see what our government is doing to these families, and no one who calls themselves an American should think any of this is ok, under any circumstances.
@BillPascrell @SecAzar Thank you. Please channel that anger in to bipartisan action and documentation. No one who calls themselves American should think any of this is ok, under any circumstances.
@squints4444 @Kennethjpl76 @MIGOP @BenReclused @SenWarren I have no idea where you got that idea from, but it's simply not true. In fact, we've been telling parents we're "taking their kids for a bath," and then shipping them to other states. Some parents are told they'll never see their children again. We're monsters.
@RepLouBarletta Kudos to you for that. Please also urge him to treat human children with respect, regardless of how they arrived in America.
@RepMimiWalters Then why are people still complaining about immigrants taking their jobs?
@RepBradWenstrup You know what's worse than socialism? Letting Russia interfere with American democracy, fighting the Americans who are trying to prevent that, and supporting a chief executive who lost 118 members of his administration due to lying and corruption.		We elected you. Please help us.
@almrnanook @bluesammie1 @MIGOP @SenWarren Are you saying we're doing the right thing by taking children from their parents, with no idea how to reunite them? I'm trying to understand your argument.
@BreitbartNews @GOP Joe Arpaio: criminal contempt of court - convicted.	Don Blankenship: conspiracy to violate federal mine-safety standards - convicted.	Michael Grimm: felony federal tax fraud - convicted.	Greg Gianforte: assault - convicted.

@GOP BTW, @GOP: "odious" means "hateful."

@SenAngusKing So many politicians are denouncing Pruitt, but I haven't seen a single one suggest prosecution for violating ethics, America's trust, and the law. Why not?
@SenatorTomUdall Will he allowed to walk away, or will he be prosecuted for using his federal position to violate the law? Isn't it time we provide a true deterrent to abusing government power?
@OversightDems @RepCummings Will you be pressing charges, or does he get a free pass for resigning?
@dg_phelps @MrYankeeFan @NAACP @kabiu @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Look how well that worked for Nixon as an excuse. No, he didn't need a reason ... but he _chose_ one that may well have been illegal. We'll find out soon enough.
@Gathering_Roses @NAACP @kabiu @SenateMajLdr Oh, look: @EPAScottPruitt just resigned. How many of the "best people" have left the sinking ship? 118?		https://t.co/vYwnQpUWGk
@Gathering_Roses @NAACP @kabiu @SenateMajLdr Let's circle back on that in a bit, shall we?
@dg_phelps @MrYankeeFan @NAACP @kabiu @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump "And, in fact, when I decided to just do it [i.e. fire Comey], I said to myself, I said: 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story."
@dg_phelps @MrYankeeFan @NAACP @kabiu @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Here, let me help:		"I have the absolute right to PARDON myself"	"And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust... shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State."
@dg_phelps @MrYankeeFan @NAACP @kabiu @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Examples?
@MrYankeeFan @NAACP @kabiu @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Glad you read it. The Constitution's still important.
@MrYankeeFan @NAACP @kabiu @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Wishful thinking, my friend. Wishful thinking.
@JanGarner64 @NAACP @kabiu @SenateMajLdr Oh, believe me, I did.
@EPA Newsflash: the @EPA is supposed to PROTECT the environment.
@MollyJongFast Thank you for spelling "you're" correctly. :)
@NAACP @kabiu @SenateMajLdr said himself that a president should not be allowed to nominate a SCOTUS justice during the final months of his presidency.
@SenatorHeitkamp I think I'd like to see "bipartisan" continue to be part of our vocabulary.
@RepJoseSerrano If this is what happens when "they don't send us their best people, folks," maybe we should be a little more respectful.
@FoxNews @SecPompeo Let's hope he stresses the "fully verified" part.
@TaxReformExpert @realDonaldTrump American companies have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders. Don't blame the CEO; blame the ignorant, short-sighted economic policy. What did you THINK would happen?
@CongressmanHice @POTUS @realDonaldTrump We NEED to support the rule of law and the Constitution!		"I have the absolute right to PARDON myself"	"Take the guns first, go through due process second."	" I don‚Äôt even wait. You can do anything... Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything."
@GeorgeTakei No worries: it's been postponed until November.
@TrumpStudents Appaling! Almost as bad as keeping children in cages.
@RepDanKildee Thank you, Congressman. In America, the "right to self defense" should not mean that toddlers should represent themselves in court.
@KTHopkins Is that true for families fleeing violence, abuse, and hostile governments, or only white-skinned English-speaking families?
@markrobinsonNC Only in America do "free speech" and "right to self defense" mean "toddlers must represent themselves in court."		Shame on you for using God's name to justify ruining children's lives.
@RepMarkWalker How lucky she doesn't have to represent herself in court.
@thehill They're making quite the assumption, there.

@Dowens8490 @kabiu A pathological liar must understand and care about the difference between truth and not-truth. Not sure he qualifies.

@SenatorCardin No, it will be Congress. He's already defying the judiciary. Please fight to maintain American values and lawful government.
@donjuanw @RyanAFournier @TrumpStudents @washingtonpost Ha, funny. Choose any news source.		https://t.co/wpg0Lg7oBZ
@donjuanw @RyanAFournier @TrumpStudents @washingtonpost They invented video of him saying he would ban Muslims? Wow.

@RepHankJohnson Thank you for speaking out against this ignorant, hateful order. Please keep fighting for liberty and justice.

@thehill America would not exist without immigration.  FTFY.
@maddow @nytimes Now THOSE are true American values. I take back some of the things I've thought about lawyers. :-)
@Kaysexton20 @RyanAFournier @TrumpStudents Do you remember WWII? Silencing the media and banning a religion is EXACTLY like Germany.
@RepJeffDuncan Don't pretend to be a Christian if you're stranding refugees in war zones. What's next, internment camps? Learn from WWII. https://t.co/qkCCyWk86T
@RepJeffDuncan I have. It's ignorant, invites retaliation, won't increase safety. American values do not include fear, bigotry, and hatred.

@FoxNews @KellyannePolls @JudgeJeanine @POTUS Sorry, I'll be watching an #AlternativeChannel.

@cocobluepoint @hackinac He represents the worst in us, but he seems to be inspiring the best--in opposition, unwittingly uniting America.
@timkaine Please keep fighting against fear, hate, and bigotry. Those are not American values. We should learn from WWII mistakes.

@RepDelBene @mollyhooper Thank you. Alarmism is one of the greatest threats to freedom. Just look at what fear has cost us since 9/11.

@TrumpStudents My favorite thing about @realDonaldTrump is that he's empowered women to speak up against #rape and #abuse.
@seanspicer TIL: "Liberal" has become the new code word for "educated."

@nikkihaley @The_RGA We've been living in fear ever since. We've given up freedoms &amp; spent $trillions fighting phantoms, just as they hoped.
@WendyLongNY One of the reasons America has always been great is that we have the right to express unpopular opinions.

@Ster24080753 Sure, if you like. Enjoy your visit. Regardless of politics, we all want a better world for our kids.
@Ster24080753 Which? Happy to continue a conversation, or not, as you prefer.
@Ster24080753 Being respectful never goes unnoticed.	It saddens me that we disagree on objective facts. But I appreciate your view.
@Ster24080753 He's genuinely uninformed and misinformed. His economics are mathematically unsound. And he's so full of hate.
@Ster24080753 His tax plan gives breaks to the wealthy and penalizes the poor. He didn't "misspeak" when he said Kaine was the GOP NJ gov.
@Ster24080753 No, they're not. Listen to a complete speech. He admitted to lying 30 times during his own deposition when he sued O'Brien.
@Ster24080753 @ballincrazy No, they don't, and you certainly don't -- thank you.
@Ster24080753 Just listen to him. Contradicts himself daily. Invents his own truth. Bad at history, math, economics. Thrives on hate. Nope.
@ballincrazy @Ster24080753 Thanks, don't need a safe space. I have actual arguments. You talk to blind sheep.
@ballincrazy @Ster24080753 His record speaks for itself. Trump U is just the latest of decades of scams.		https://t.co/jU3LNU1ueD
@ballincrazy @Ster24080753 Why are Trump supporters so quick to insult? No real argument? Fraud is illegal. Period.
@Ster24080753 Liar, yes. Criminal, probably. Insane no. Trump invents his own "truth" and changes it by the hour. He cares only about Trump.
@ballincrazy @Ster24080753 That doesn't make it any less fraudulent. He offered a contract and admits to breaching it, consistently. Fraud.
@akmi921 You really like to hurl the insults, don't you?
@akmi921 Not at all. I don't define an incomplete cluster of cells that cannot survive on its own as a human.
@akmi921 True, but irrelevant. By your logic that's true for cancerous tumors as well.
@ballincrazy @Ster24080753 And let's not forget the fraudulent "university." He's a scam artist.
@ballincrazy @Ster24080753 Where are those stats from? More than 13 have failed, spectacularly, and devastated the "little people."
@ballincrazy @Ster24080753 When your entire platform is about US jobs, you should set an example ... and pay your workers.
@Ster24080753 HRC's entire platform isn't about #Xenophobia and bringing jobs back to America. I don't like her, either, but she's sane.
@akmi921 Actually, that's not true; look it up. And you've already said it's a different organism.
@akmi921 I'm sorry you think that's what it is. And I have no need to insult you. I just can't understand your inconsistent reasoning.
@akmi921 Biologically, that's exactly what it is. SCIENCE!
@Ster24080753 The candidate who promises to bring jobs back to the US has offshored his own investments and mfg. Who's had 4 bankruptcies?
@akmi921 Why should a woman submit to a parasite? Am I guilty of murder if I refuse to donate blood?
@akmi921 And unable to survive without a parasitic relationship with the host body.
@akmi921 I'm honestly trying to understand. Should women control their own bodies, or not?
@akmi921 Nope. Prevention isn't murder. Otherwise ANY sperm or egg that does not become a human is murder.
@akmi921 So, pro-choice? That, we can agree on.
@akmi921 Have you seen, personally, what happens to unwanted children, esp. of drug abusers?
@Ster24080753 He's bankrupted 4 companies, built a sham university, doesn't pay his workers, invests in overseas property. Go, Trump. :-\
@akmi921 You want the gov't to rule women's bodies, but think I want them to make my decisions? That's not reality. You're quite confused.
@Ster24080753 Now go find out how much Obama is providing via FEMA.

@RepShimkus US Constitution, 1st Amendment: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion"
@DWStweets LIBERAL with the rules? LIBERAL with security? LIBERAL with following the law? That's not liberal; that's corruption.

@NitaLowey #UniteBlackAndBlue to promote trust and community over division, hate, and violence.
@andieiamwhoiam Haters are everywhere but don't speak for everyone. @Blklivesmatter official statement: https://t.co/gyKbUysZhJ
@WhiteHouse @POTUS We all need to stop shooting and blaming, and start listening instead. #UniteBlackAndBlue.
@AbelWilliams15 @andieiamwhoiam Her husband hasn't tweeted. She's angry and afraid ... rightfully. The answer is support and cooperation.
@andieiamwhoiam There are plenty of wrongs. Supporting hate won't fix them. Cooperation and unity will. @DallasPD set a great example.
@andieiamwhoiam How much further along would we be if we earned each other's trust again instead of looking to blame? #UniteBlackAndBlue
@SenatorLankford Yes. We need to #UniteBlackAndBlue, and everyone else, and earn each other's trust. Please #DoYourJob to make that happen.
@SenToomey No, they don't need #ThoughtsAndPrayers. They need you to #DoYourJob as an elected leader, #UniteBlackAndBlue, #MakeUsSafe.
@WhiteHouse @POTUS Thank you for setting the right example.
@GregAbbott_TX Respect works both ways. @DallasPD sided with community, set great example. We must end killing, period. #UniteBlackAndBlue.
@KimHandley1 How do police and their communities regain each other's trust?
@DPDChief @KimHandley1 @BRPD #ThoughtsAndPrayers don't seem to be enough. Please keep #DoingYourJob to unite communities and police.
@RepLouBarletta It's as bad as being targeted simply because of skin color. Please #DoYourJob to #UniteBlackAndBlue to #MakeUsSafe.
@SpeakerRyan Why tolerate brutal violence against anyone? Are you "deeply disturbed" enough to #UniteBlackAndBlue, and the rest of us?
@RepBillFoster Please continue to #DoYourJob as an elected leader to #UniteBlackAndBlue ... and the rest of us, to #MakeUsSafer.
@RepAndreCarson All those #ThoughtsAndPrayers don't seem to stem the violence. Please #DoYourJob as an elected official to #MakeUsSafe.
@GovMaryFallin #ThoughtsAndPrayers don't seem to be working. Please #DoYourJob as an elected official to take action that will #MakeUsSafe.
@cathymcmorris @HouseGOP Instead of #ThoughtsAndPrayers, please #DoYourJob to create a way to #MakeUsSafe. It takes leadership and action.
@RepHankJohnson Hoping police and communities can earn each other's trust and cooperate to #MakeUsSafe.
@SenatorBurr Can you do more than sending #ThoughtsAndPrayers? Please #DoYourJob as an elected leader to #MakeUsSafer.
@KimHandley1 @WeNeedTrump Yes ... cooperation and trust will be the answer. Both sides need to earn it.
@WeNeedTrump Except that she uses actual facts and quotes @realDonaldTrump directly. Not as exciting as name calling, but do what you can.
@SenatorCollins Unity, cooperation, and action is the answer. Please continue to #DoYourJob as an elected leader to #MakeUsSafer.
@AllenWest I think they were demonstrating legally, no? You're in favor of open carry and civil disobedience ... or just for white people?
@SpeakerRyan I hope your "action" was to increase penalties for #Fraud and #Libel. Videos were proven to be bogus. https://t.co/8eaEN2HjCT
@NRSC @GOP You realize this wouldn't be a thing if we'd addressed racism half a century ago, right?		https://t.co/PwpAu5Xr1c
RT @HillaryClinton: Well, ‚Äã*we‚Äôve*‚Äã got plenty to say about Mike Pence. Here you go: https://t.co/LGbVGvN7F7
@GOP Still doesn't realize that facts are independent of what people think or want them to be. https://t.co/l5oIdBoIRN
RT @SenFranken: I took #TimeToCallOut those who are trying to spin a #WebofDenial by distorting climate change science. Watch here: https:/‚Ä¶
@GovChristie Reducing education funds to avoid raising taxes is NOT something to be proud of. #DoYourJob. https://t.co/JfpU3AnzX4
@GovChristie Shutting down in-progress public works projects to avoid raising taxes is not something to be proud of. https://t.co/JfpU3AnzX4
@AMCHelps Thx for confirming. Maybe time to rethink that policy. https://t.co/eyNHIY42ff
@NRA, @SenateGOP, and @SenateDems, a challenge: offer a practical, effective, feasible solution and gun rights will no longer be an issue.
@AllenWest Yes: he was stopped for being black and having a "wide-set nose." Read your own article. https://t.co/ZRuwKJF4x1
@AllenWest You still DON'T KNOW if suspect's gun was fired? Get facts before making up a ridiculous defense. https://t.co/djIvg27AdD
@AllenWest Are two officers not capable of restraining the man they're sitting on? https://t.co/djIvg27AdD
@SpeakerRyan When Law Enforcement regains public trust, everyone will be safer. #StopKillingPeople https://t.co/tNtLZuVDYN
@RepAdrianSmith Yes! When law enforcement regains public trust, communities will support them. Police will be safer. https://t.co/KJAv6vW0cw
@wisgop Defending gun ownership after every shooting is like defending car ownership after every collision. Why? https://t.co/DU3o0D1cSF
@marcorubio A good start. If only our government could be so wise. https://t.co/LRu1oDsXlV
@SpeakerRyan Same is also true for attacks BY people who are supposed to protect us. Please work BOTH issues. https://t.co/Q2Fg6gz0RQ
@BreakingNewzman #ThoughtsAndPrayers aren't the answer. Listening, empathy, cooperation, and action are. https://t.co/HmRzqiekaN
@SenTedCruz Make the decision to vote on a SCOTUS nominee, so we can judge the rule of law.
@AskCiti Thank you. While you're at it, you might reconsider the limitation of your "Security Word" to 10 characters.
@AskCiti Do you proofread your web pages? https://t.co/4MZ7tAJg3f
@Citi I hope you test your software better than you test your web pages. This is embarrassing. https://t.co/YtCqqi7ocO
