God says "Come back; I'll be here; if it's a thousand times a day.  I'm here to fix you. Just turn to me" #nevergiveup #Turn2Jesus
Too jealous to be happy for someone else, too busy to care? #attitude #adjustment #required Yu think you're a Christian?

The great enemy of truth is very often not the lie,deliberate, contrived &amp; dishonest, but the myth, persistent, persuasive &amp; unrealistic.JFK
An error does not become truth by reason of multiplied propagation, nor does truth become error because nobody sees it.
Some people think truth can be hidden with a little cover-up &amp; decoration.As time goes by,what is true is revealed &amp; what's fake fades away.
