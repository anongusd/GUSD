@Pcola_eddiet I mean, he might or might not be a Trump lover. All I see in that tweet is a lying islamophobe. Either way, surprised I didn't see this tweet until he won. I guess he was nobody until tonight.

@JesseLehrich https://t.co/GxCtwJm7lv
@JesseLehrich Having folks on the left defend Maduro as if he was (sometimes even invoking the ghost of!) Salvador Allende helps the Rs maneuver this into the false assertion that we're protecting Venezuela, and by extension America, from socialists like Maduro, Bernie, AOC, Warren, etc.
@srl @runforsomething @letamericavote You want unnoticed, don't ask Broward County, FL about their history with the supervisor of elections office.
@JesseLehrich Between this and Rick Scott's careful curation of public relations photo ops aimed at the Puerto Rican community, the GOP is making solid strides in Florida communities the national democrats continue to take for granted.
@JesseLehrich It's not a diplomatic effort. It's not foreign policy. It's a political attempt (pushed by Rubio) to create a new Hispanic firewall in a Florida electorate that continues to get more conservative as more northerners migrate South. Florida's status as a swing state is in play.
In so-called majority-minority districts, statewide (and future presidential) campaigns need to put MORE effort into connecting with these voters and spreading their message. This did not happen in Florida in 2018.
Despite the fact that some of us speak until we're "blue" in the face about Hispanic voters not being a monolithic group, no one listens. Ppl assume the Hispanic vote is locked up. 		If the results of the Gillum/Nelson campaigns didn't show you otherwise, I don't know what will.

Amazing. Only a candidate as universally reviled as Ted Cruz could grant us a general election Donald Trump candidacy.
@meganfrancis Maybe, I don't know how much of Trump's base gravitates toward the guy who tried to pass comprehensive immigration reform.
@meganfrancis The GOP thinks they can ride out this Trump wave... they fail to realize the wave has not yet crested.
@meganfrancis He's already a national figure and still has tons of deep pockets and establishment support in his corner.
@meganfrancis I think even "considering" to endorse Ted was his pragmatic side. He is an opportunist, but there's nothing to gain for him.

No holding on that play? Oh okay. Right.
THAT'S how you beat the blitz. #NDvsFSU
Tipped? Jesus don't scare.
@TomahawkNation 2nd for him today.
Bad decision to throw that, but damn fine catch and run by Karlos.
Wide open to the right. :/
@DomBrady At this point I think Will Muschamp is getting himself fired just to spite me.
Amazing tackle by Hunter. Got his hand on the foot and pulled him back. GREAT STOP. #NDvsFSU
Lost in all this is the fact that these guys are probably literally KILLING Rick Trickett right now.
Left tackle has been a bigger issue all season though. Was supposed to be a strength. @DMcComasOB @MoveTheSticks
A not awful punt. Thank God for small miracles.
Memory is a short, fragile thing RT @AMFKNole: Guys, let's be clear. That was the worst decision (on field division) a FSU QB has ever made.
Baby Admiral is a monster.

@chopsteak I have been stuck here in FL... but I remember that first ad Covered CA posted online was GLORIOUS. I wished it was airing here.
@chopsteak that's all I'm allowed to say about that. Lol.
@chopsteak the diff in CA is a.) the state set up their own network and b.) implemented an outreach plan.
@chopsteak Latinos make up a third of the uninsured population nationwide, so I'm anecdotally sure in CA and FL those numbers are higher.
@chopsteak the outreach budget in FL is miniscule compared to theirs.
@chopsteak I guarantee their friend Juan isn't a certified application counselor. I will say, if CA is having trouble we're screwed.
@chopsteak maybe not offensive, but really just an oversimplified answer she'd only give to a anglo writer.

@Pcola_EddieT LSU/Georgia were particularly bad (not Texas A&amp;M but still). SC and Auburn were nothing special. UF's secondary was stellar.
@Pcola_EddieT UF's problems were mostly on offense. QB and O-line specifically. The defense was top-15 even w/ injuries.
@Pcola_EddieT And yet, we scored more on Florida than any SEC team. Larger point is SEC defenses are having a down year. UF's is exception.
