@MikeBrendan Then change things. But women will never be taken seriously by banning together in orange t-shirts fighting for a right to kill
@MikeBrendan Yes some men see women as 2nd class citizens and some women think men are pigs. And?
@MikeBrendan Women feel out of control and the one thing they can control is their vagina? Thats your rationale?
@MikeBrendan Nope, killing babies wont change a womans role in the militaty either.
@MikeBrendan Then fight gender pay equality. Killing babies doesn't prove a womans worth on the job. Next point?
@MikeBrendan So its perception? No invasive ultrasound b/c im sensitive about the sharp object you're about to stick in me to kill a baby?
@MikeBrendan Because I dont believe in murder.
@MikeBrendan Women and men cannot be equal in all things b/c men cannot have children so you can stop being so considerate on this point.
@MikeBrendan You do realize that abortion is also "invasive" right?
@MikeBrendan If she wants an abortion and its early on then its medically more sensitive than a traditional ultrasound so im ok with that.

@MikeBrendan I dont know. But not planning is def no reason to abort.
@MikeBrendan There is no way to change that woman carry the children but it isn't a license to kill. Its a biological misfortune for some.
@MikeBrendan How is that much different than a father having no rights to his baby if his gf/wife becomes preg&amp; wants to abort?
@MikeBrendan Then work on adoption laws instead of using your energies on assisting in murdering children.
@MikeBrendan Being pregnant through a rape cannot be an easy thing but it isn't controlling her.
@MikeBrendan Thats ridiculous. The rape is the control. An abortion is killing a child. The woman could give the baby up.
@FashionablyB So I can be like you? No thanks.
@MikeBrendan Nope. It isn't. I just think it is sad commentary on society that we would kill babies so carelessly.

@OurLadyBusiness I think a woman who takes no responsibility in her sexual actions&amp; then wants an abortion as birth control is pathetic.
@OurLadyBusiness You treat women as if they shld be allowed to make no choice in life except to abort. Theres no responsibility of the women
@OurLadyBusiness Contraception is free in many places so if a woman fails to get it&amp; becomes preg she has no liability in decisions.
@OurLadyBusiness You need it lower than $9 a month?
@OurLadyBusiness Why is there NO responsibility in it? Why is it just women want/women get? It is pathetic.
@OurLadyBusiness Uh, if contraception is available&amp; not taken why can't I call them out for that? Huh?
@OurLadyBusiness Access isn't the issue, it has become the argument for allowing abortion on demand for lazy women.
@OurLadyBusiness But the stats SHOW women who became preg&amp; request abortion did NOT access contraception at the same rate they became preg.
@OurLadyBusiness You don't even realize how silly you sounds do you? Sad really.
@OurLadyBusiness No, I fully trust some women to decide on their own to kill a baby instead of creating a meaningful life for herself&amp; child
@OurLadyBusiness A woman wanting an abortion is a patient? LOL! Isn't she actually a client? Abortion is a business....
@OurLadyBusiness How about the fact there were fewer than 20thou abortions in TX pre RoeVWade? You're ok with it being over 80thou now?
@OurLadyBusiness Ever heard of propoganda? The Hitler way of persuading ppl? Thats what pro-choice ppl do. Successfully. Unfortunately.
@OurLadyBusiness Women who have become preg use the clinics for abortion more than contraception. #facts
@OurLadyBusiness Oh no, I think a two year old wrote your last tweet.
@OurLadyBusiness You're proclaiming women who has abortion b/c she's been taught that saves her future doesn't need other possibilities.
@OurLadyBusiness But it is NOT just their life! You just don't get that!
@OurLadyBusiness Money is more important to you than life? Wow! Bold statement.
@OurLadyBusiness It wasn't a gas station so I assume the abortion spill is just their welcome retort to the chiming doorbell.
@OurLadyBusiness You're pathetic! Raise women up, give them support to move on with the way life unfolds. Stop changing it to suit you.
@OurLadyBusiness The most pathetic thig I hear from ppl like you is that women who have an unexpected pregnancy have no shot at a future.
@OurLadyBusiness YOU are the problem. Women can have unexpected children and go on to become educated and live fullfilled lives.
@OurLadyBusiness You should be ashmed of yourself. You don't give women credit for being able to handle their lives. Kill the baby!
@OurLadyBusiness Do you know the stats on women who have access to contraception, but become pregnant b/c they don't use it? I'll wait.
@OurLadyBusiness They have PP on video doing just that time and time again.  @the_hfm
@OurLadyBusiness Don't use words you don't understand. @the_hfm
@OurLadyBusiness I walked into one in Austin to ask for directions and was asked if I wanted an ABORTION! Good grief! @the_hfm

@OurLadyBusiness But if I were a member of #txlege I could tear your fact lacking points apart in a more public setting. Sweet! @the_hfm
@OurLadyBusiness HAHA! No, when I point out your stats are incorrect and misconstrued you get testy. @the_hfm
@OurLadyBusiness Apparently you aren't. @the_hfm
@OurLadyBusiness Wrong. Latest polls show younger Americans are pro-life.They are smart enough to distinguish b/w rights &amp; life. @the_hfm
@OurLadyBusiness Oh, you need me to tell you how not to get pregnant so an unwanted preg doesn't occur? Ok!  @the_hfm
@OurLadyBusiness I don't need to trump up what viability is. Killing anything after a detectable heartbeat is barbaric. @the_hfm
@OurLadyBusiness Spend your energies on educating poor/minority/rural women instead of helping them kill their children. @the_hfm
@OurLadyBusiness Oh please. You read what allows you to sleep at night. I can't side w/ taking life. Sorry you can. @the_hfm
@OurLadyBusiness LOL! I hate women b/c I want to protect the life of a child? I thinnk 20 wks is sufficient to decide. @the_hfm
@OurLadyBusiness I don't give a damn what you object to! The woman is who is pregnant, the child deserves protection too! @the_hfm
@OurLadyBusiness Just say it outloud once.. "I want the right to kill babies any time I want".It is what you are saying anyway. @the_hfm
@OurLadyBusiness Your standard of viability isn't one the entire medical community agrees on though.@the_hfm
@OurLadyBusiness If a woman has a medical emergency a doctor will make the decision. Just to kill a child shouldn't be a right. @the_hfm
@OurLadyBusiness But becoming pregnant is NOT a lifethreatening medical emergency. @the_hfm #BirdsandtheBees
@OurLadyBusiness You can't have it both ways either. There are consequences to actions. An ACTUAL medical emergency is different. @the_hfm
@OurLadyBusiness Feminist have turned their bodies into playgrounds w/ no consequence they can't just discard at whim. Sick.  @the_hfm
@OurLadyBusiness Why is killing a baby a "medical" decision? @the_hfm
@OurLadyBusiness No woman should have the right to kill a child at 35, 36 weeks. @the_hfm #txlege #hb60
@OurLadyBusiness In consulation w/ their families? Why? Their families, including the father of an unborn, have no say. @the_hfm
@OurLadyBusiness No one is banning abortion only creating safety for the women and protection for the unborn. @the_hfm #hb60 #txlege
