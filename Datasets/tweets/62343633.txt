Unions are becoming more modern and reinventing themselves for the new economy. #CollisionConf
If we are going to be creating so much wealth with new technology we can choose how we invest. In a shared prosperity type of environment or amongst a small elite group of people. #CollisionConf
Training, workforce and skills are important things to invest in, to create ways for people to ladder up into newer jobs and constantly learning new skills.#CollisionConf
We have to find a way to raise wages and we have to do it collectively. We‚Äôre seeing it through collective action across the country. #CollisionConf
There‚Äôs been a lot of talk about inequality. We can make choices to invest wisely so that the future does look bright. One of the solutions is to give workers a voice in their work places and to join together in union. #collisionconf #1u
We have choices to invest wisely to ensure the future looks bright. If we‚Äôre prepared we can prepare workers for the future. #collisionconf
