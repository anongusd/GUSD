@bradplumer This is hardly Markey's first rodeo, so my hunch ‚Äî but only that ‚Äî is that it's written to enable both maximal ambition and some interpretive space for what's a nonbinding set of huge ideas crafted as an organizing vehicle.
@bradplumer I asked more widely about timeline for US net-zero goal. #AOC spox tells me the goal is w/in 10 years. Markey spox more nuanced: "Net zero is the overarching goal, among others, and we need that 10-year mobilization to help achieve those goals." #GreenNewDeal #energy
From the life-moves-pretty-fast files: in Jurassic era of mid-2018, Jerry Brown cheered for non-binding EO on making Calif. CO2-neutral by 2045. Present: DiFi resolution weaker than GND but still calls for US to be net-zero GHGs ASAP &amp; no later than 2050. #ClimateChange
