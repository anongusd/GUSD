Be strength for the weak and oppressed, a light that scatters darkness, hope for the hopeless, a voice for the voiceless; be for others what they cannot be for themselves.
As stated many times over, the key to solving most, if not all, of the world's ailments stems from the inherent evils wrought from currency, and those few who wield control over it.
Human words and laws, generally spoken, thought or written out, are ever inadequate to address the underlying intent and fullness of universal expression; inversely so, the more is stated, the further it detracts from its origin of truth, simplicity and integrity.  Even so, KISS.

‚ÄúThe purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well.‚Äù	- Ralph Waldo Emerson
The fine print of life's experiences has taught me that one can never gain something for nothing; therefore, always rail vociferously against free education, healthcare, etc., for it will take far more than you could ever hope to give in exchange.
@wends1958 You should be more concerned with getting right with your Creator and raising awareness with those you're nearest too because the time is upon us to do so or be lost forever.  I hope you seek the truth and find it...my conversation with you is over as there's nothing more to say.
@wends1958 All of your fake news or lame street media has served to effectively and continually blind you and those of your ilk.  This idea of democracy and a republic was all but a veneer from realizing the real power has always remained with but a select few since the beginning of time.
@wends1958 Not at all, tho you're wasting your time arguing semantics and useless trivialities.  The fact remains these man made systems were all designed to fail.  Increased policies, regulations, laws, inflation, all serve to bring about a collapse and reset of untold proportions.
@Ray_USA_ RIP my brothers your sacrifice was not it vain
@RepRashida How is the desire to protect your people from those who wish to enter illegally and have caused much harm racist in any way?  You are an enemy of the people and need to be removed from office.
@wends1958 @ChrisLNuckolls @Eggsalad1 @mortisnoctu @Essem_Jay @EleanorMontague @cmclymer As it stands, America is currently a plutocratic corporatocracy, which would infer my original meme post that it lends itself as being more of a republic than a democracy.
@wends1958 @ChrisLNuckolls @Eggsalad1 @mortisnoctu @Essem_Jay @EleanorMontague @cmclymer You're right, it was intended to be at the local and state level, but was upturned as intended by these 'fore fathers' of ours because they knew such rights or freedoms would be swapped for a false sense of security eventually by and thru gentle manipulation.
@wends1958 First mistake was in your quoting from an MSM source which deliberately subverts truth for gain.  Tell me, do you consider your gov't to be a democracy when it passes laws to spy upon it's own citizens?  Which democratic majority of sound mind would ever pass such foolish laws?
