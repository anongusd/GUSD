Today, we had our third vote to pay furloughed workers during this partial shutdown. 214 Democrats denied DHS workers immediate pay. I‚Äôll continue to fight for federal workers to receive their paychecks and keep Democrats from using them as pawns.
Today we reflect on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.‚Äôs message of compassion and mutual respect for others. #MLKDay
The President‚Äôs proposal today is a good starting point and I urge Speaker Pelosi to put politics aside and come to the table to reopen the government, pay federal workers, and seriously address these critical immigration issues.
I have long advocated for a comprehensive immigration reform solution that includes increased border security and fairly treating people who were brought here through no fault of their own and know no other country than the United States.
