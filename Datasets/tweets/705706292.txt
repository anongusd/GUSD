RT @alexnazaryan: "I was in the White House, and I was lonely. And I said, 'Let's go to Iraq.'" -Trump at CPAC.
Trump declared a national emergency to build a border wall two weeks ago, capping nearly two months of fighting w/Congress over wall funding. No mention of it in his CPAC speech today, other than a cursory mention of building the wall.
Trump has been speaking for nearly 45 minutes, two days after returning from his second summit with Kim Jong Un in Vietnam. So far, Trump has made no mention of that meeting, instead complaining about Mueller, Comey, Sessions and media coverage of his crowd sizes.
Trump at CPAC begins to riff on "a great friend of mine from New York. He is a stone cold killer. He's a brutal man. He's actually not even a good friend of my because he would turn on me and two seconds."
Trump at CPAC: “I have one of the great inventions in history. It’s called TiVo."
“Robert Mueller never received a vote, and neither did the person who appointed him,” Trump says, referring to deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein—who was appointed by Trump and confirmed by the Senate.
Trump at CPAC is mocking media coverage of his public plea to Russia during the 2016 campaign to hack Hillary Clinton's emails. Now the crowd is chanting "Lock her up."

"The only national emergency is that our president is an idiot,” Ann Coulter said on a Los Angeles radio show today. Trump earlier said Coulter was “off the reservation” but “probably…very nice."
“Enjoy your life,” Trump tells his new attorney general, Bill Barr.
“I probably will never get it,” Trump says of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Trump on Ann Coulter: “I like her. But she’s off the reservation.”

Trump seems to be saying Congress is giving him *too* much money for border security unrelated to the wall. "I don’t know what to do with all of the money they’re giving us. It’s crazy."

Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump held between $229M and $786M in assets at the end of 2017, according to their new financial disclosures. That includes one asset valued at greater than $50M. https://t.co/ocvqrR1mLA
At one point in 2017, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump had liabilities valued between $40M and $200M, of which $13M-$65M has already been paid off. Disclosure forms require individuals to report liabilities at their highest point during the reporting period. https://t.co/ocvqrR1mLA
New disclosure appears to show Ivanka Trump's assets falling in 2017. But that's because she switched last year from an annual profit-sharing arrangement to receiving a flat payment from the Trump Org. Her assets at the end of 2017 were at least $55M. https://t.co/ocvqrR1mLA
NEW: Kushner saw the min value of his assets rise in 2017, per new financial disclosure. He held at least $174M in assets at the end of 2017, although the form’s broad ranges make it impossible to tell if his wealth rose or fell. w/@bykowicz https://t.co/ocvqrR1mLA
