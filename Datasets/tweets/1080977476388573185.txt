@GiomaraJimenez Very beautiful as always
@AKasingye With the way you conduct yourself plus your personality i doubt whether your trainers are still there.	Never the less congratulations for standing one in the million
@KagutaMuseveni Awono you are talking onandetta omutima omulungi eri NRM naye maama luli
@KagutaMuseveni Awonno kakekale nabe kyanamukaka balowozeko mzee
@KagutaMuseveni Again any good leader should ask for reports especially for the killings, just like you said in 1980s. And a solution is found.
@MarianickT @CaroLeclerc1 @EyesAbroad @CESOSACO @CusoIntl @CCCICCIC @ChevrierAntoine @ICN_RCC @CanadaEthiopia @CanadaDev How you missed to visit East Africa Uganda in particular
@KagutaMuseveni I doubt that 2040 thing but if you can put the ears on ground, you will be able to handle the right things at the right time
@Mukulaa How I wish you made extra efforts to meet Bobi Wine, it could have worked for you politically. I know you know.
Something you can give Ugandans now, is telling us that you won't stand and compete in the next elections. 	Then we can reconsider you worthy as you claim.
@mkainerugaba Ok
@Kasubo2 @KagutaMuseveni Check, research or read about what is happening else where.	After 35 years you can only show one which a substandard and more so it's a quarter a mile. 	Shameless
@SpeakerRyan Then you could win if you has participated because like the father like the son
@mildredtuhaise @nbstv Fuuna ndagamuntu twebereremu banno abasajja tubasobola
@kagire @HEBobiwine @cnni @RobynCurnowCNN No doubt you gonna bring us change in Uganda come 2021
@KagutaMuseveni @jumuiya One thing that will ever make happy with you again is, "I am stepping down 2021" other think about what made you fight in 1980s
This is good to start thinking outside the box 	Thanks DP https://t.co/3bOswL4rPK

@realDonaldTrump I won't miss
@MarianickT @MCIC_CA Just read about you and liked personality.	I must have missed to find you in Ecuador #Panchanoh@gmail.com
@KagutaMuseveni We pray to God that maybe on your return a natural hazard can occur and Uganda celebrates that awaited victory.

@KagutaMuseveni You can't add on Uganda's development anymore only that you don't want to accept
@nilepostnews One day they will invite him and ask him to talk about people power
@realDonaldTrump I wanted to be the last one to cross before you build this wall so help me God
I love the ground work General Muntu is doing to have a new political environment
Ugandans let us stand firm that we can also make it if D.R.CONGO can make it.	Bobi wine in front all Ugandans let us support and we end this dictatorship of 35 years
RT @HEBobiwine: Extremely honored to be named amongst the @ForeignPolicy Global Thinkers, 2019.	Humbled that the small things we do for ourâ€¦
@HEBobiwine @ForeignPolicy Go higher 2021 is the year we put you in that top most seat.	#peoplepowerourpower
Let no one make you to think stupid what you did was right and stick to your words https://t.co/3RdqCzIlIq
The problem with this fool Mwenda is to think that he has the monopoly on understand. Keep your beliefs to yours and maybe your family Ugandans need change at all costs https://t.co/SFf2cAT2S0
