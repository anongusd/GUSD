@mcimaps I could see a candidate like Biden or Klobuchar doing really well in the panhandle, and Harris or Booker doing well in Broward &amp; Miami-Dade.
A reminder that the same Russian trolls/bots who were flooding social media with pro-Trump/anti-Hillary propaganda in 2016 were also trying to help Bernie in the primary, in an effort to keep the party divided. Russia played a big role in driving the #BernieOrBust narrative.
@girlsreallyrule Also worth remembering that the Russian bots that were flooding social media with pro-Trump propaganda in 2016 also were trying to help Bernie in the primary, to keep the party divided. Russia played a big role in the #BernieOrBust movement.
On the other hand, I also feel like Bernie Sanders will have a higher floor of support in the primaries but a relatively low ceiling. So while he could be overshadowed by all the other candidates, in some ways he benefits from such a large field.
Bernie Sanders beat expectations in 2016 because he was the only compelling alternative to Hillary in the primary. Now that there‚Äôs literally a couple dozen other candidates, I feel like he won‚Äôt stand out or gain much traction in 2020.

@GOP @kayleighmcenany Speaking of party realignment, I‚Äôm old enough to remember when the GOP loved the Pope and hated the Russian government.
@jonfavs I wish the Pod could moderate a primary debate.
@brianschatz There‚Äôs also not enough emphasis on the fact that this many ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù federal workers going without a paycheck or two putting them in such a dire financial situation reveals something very structurally unstable in our economy. ‚ÄúMiddle class‚Äù is not what it used to mean.
@dick_nixon Kamala Harris was also Attorney General of California for 6 years prior to becoming a Senator. She has more government experience than the last 4 presidents did prior to taking office.
@GOP @kayleighmcenany He couldn‚Äôt compromise with his own party when they controlled Congress the first 2 years of his term, then. Because they never prioritized the wall. 		A working class family‚Äôs paycheck being delivered on time is more of an emergency than the wall.
@GOP @VP No amount of gaslighting will erase the fact that a funding bill without the wall was passed unanimously in the Senate prior to the shutdown, and Trump claimed - on camera - that he will accept full responsibility for it. 800,000 American families not being paid is on him.
@DLoesch That the more complete video evidence that has surfaced doesn‚Äôt support the accounts of either side as entirely truthful in this case.
@DLoesch School fight chants are typically done at sports games.
@OhNoSheTwitnt Kamala Harris has the same amount of experience as Obama in the Senate when he ran, representing twice as many constituents. Plus she‚Äôs been Attorney General of the largest state in the country for 6 years prior. 		She has more government experience than the last 4 presidents had
@tariqnasheed This is a worthy debate to have during the primaries. But if she‚Äôs the nominee, I would take her on her worst day over Trump &amp; his nightmare of a justice department at their best. We can not afford to make the perfect the enemy of the good.

@JacobAWohl Jason Van Dyke - the cop convicted of 2nd degree murder &amp; 16 counts of aggravated battery w/ a deadly weapon for killing Laquan McDonald - was sentenced to 6 years 9 months in prison. 		He faced 96 years &amp; prosecutors were only asking for 18-20. 		Yes there is.

White privilege is when Jason Van Dyke could‚Äôve gotten up to 96 years in prison, prosecutors were only seeking 18-20, and he ended up getting 6 years 9 months.
Jason Van Dyke was sentenced to a year and a half more time in prison for executing #LaquanMcDonald than Crystal Mason was for unknowingly voting illegally in Texas as a black woman.
Trump will declare a national emergency &amp; appropriate funds via executive order to the border wall, then call for a re-opening of the govt. 		Congress will re-open the govt while Trump is challenged in court. 		It will make its way to the Supreme Court. Could be a 5-4 decision. https://t.co/rj2q17Not5
It‚Äôs crazy that Jason Van Dyke got about the same amount of time in prison as the guy who organized the Fyre Festival.
It‚Äôs crazy that Martin Shkreli got sentenced to more time in prison than Jason Van Dyke.
Drug charges have put many people in prison for more time than Jason Van Dyke got for executing Laquan McDonald.
@GOP Why wasn‚Äôt this a crisis from January 2017 through November 2018? Trump was railing against the ‚Äúcaravan‚Äù right before the election, but didn‚Äôt have the guts to shutdown the government over it until after?
@michaelhenry123 @TomiLahren @TheDemocrats @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi @GOP 800,000 Americans are going without their paychecks because of this shutdown - which Trump claimed full credit for. 		Mitch McConnell can override him and bring a clean CR for a vote, but doesn‚Äôt have the courage to.
@GOP Thanks Obama
@GOP @VP Except the 800,000 families not getting paychecks due to the shutdown. 		Or the children separated from their parents and thrown in cages. 		Or the children who want to seek asylum here from war-ravaged countries that we played a big role in destabilizing.
@GOP @VP ‚ÄúMy wife works at a school that would not employee my boss.‚Äù
It‚Äôs crazy that Jason Van Dyke could theoretically get probation for the 2nd degree murder charge but faces a mandatory minimum of 6 years in prison for the aggravated battery charges.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump But we‚Äôll put children in detention centers at the border, we‚Äôll strip parents of health insurance and keep federal employees from getting paychecks, and ban children from entering our country from war zones in countries we helped destabilize.
@JacobAWohl The government‚Äôs primary responsibility is to keep its citizens safe. Your question should be why has the government failed dismally in this basic duty in Flint?

@DanJohn88147827 @TomiLahren Just like the CR the Senate passed unanimously right before the shutdown.
@TomiLahren Nancy passed a bill to re-open the government 8 times since the shutdown. It‚Äôs the Senate not doing their job.

@GOP @GOPLeader Trump‚Äôs corporate tax cuts were expensive. 		The perpetual Wars in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan are expensive. 		Having 30 million Americans uninsured is expensive. 		Corporate welfare is expensive. 		Our gun violence crisis is expensive.

@Jeff_in_Tx @AOC Well, that‚Äôs following his personal preference rather than the scope of his constitutional authority as the leader in a co-equal branch of government.
How I think the shutdown ends:		Neither side folds. 		Trump appropriates funds to border security (the wall) by declaring a national emergency. 		Govt re-opens while this move is challenged in the courts. 		Federal courts strike it down.		This ends up being a Supreme Court case.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump 2/3rd vote is required in each chamber of Congress to open the government. 		Senate passed a clean bill without a wall with 100 votes. 		The House has passed a clean CR 8 times. 		McConnell is holding this up. He can end this. But he won‚Äôt because he‚Äôs afraid of Trump.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Again. Why was this not a crisis for the first 2 years of Trump‚Äôs presidency?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump TRUMP TOOK CREDIT FOR THIS SHUT DOWN RIGHT BEFORE IT HAPPENED
@NateSilver538 The shutdown + the Mueller report will reveals his true floor of support.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Why wasn‚Äôt the wall such an urgent priority the first 23 months of Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency? He has the House and the Senate.
@Bret4x4 @AOC Hence the lack of courage.
@Bret4x4 @AOC Because 2/3 of the vote in each chamber overrides a presidential veto and a CR without border wall funding passed the Senate unanimously not that long ago. They have the votes, McConnell just doesn‚Äôt have the courage to stand up to Trump.

@TomiLahren @Gillette @foxnation What do people find so objectionable about the Gillette ad? Have not gotten a good answer on this yet.
@saramommy1988 @tariqnasheed This is true, R Kelly was a punchline for years over his alleged abuse. Though, in fairness, he was criminally charged over a decade ago for some. And his alleged crimes are a lot worse than Rob Lowe‚Äôs - I don‚Äôt want to conflate the two, but there is a clear double standard.
@tariqnasheed It was a frequent topic in the Comedy Central Roast of Rob Lowe. So was Donald Trump‚Äôs history of housing discrimination. As was Charlie Sheen‚Äôs history of abuse. When you‚Äôre white and have money, your crimes become punchlines in Comedy Central specials.
I‚Äôd really like to know why Bernie Sanders abstained from voting to block Trump from lifting sanctions on Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. He was the only Senator who couldn‚Äôt be bothered to show up.
@GOP @PressSec They‚Äôre literally trying to bring a clean continuing resolution to the floor to open the government. McConnell is blocking it.
@daveweigel About her move to the left: If Tulsi Gabbard is going to get flak for holding socially conservative views on LGBT rights in 2004, Gillibrand certainly will (and should) for having an A-rating from the NRA &amp; opposing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants in 2007.
@daveweigel Chuck Schumer outperformed Hillary by 11 points in 2016 (and outperformed Gillibrand) and there have been no hot takes on how strong of a presidential nominee he would be. 		Klobuchar‚Äôs margins in MN are a lot more impressive than Gillibrand‚Äôs margins in NY.
@caphilltrish @AOC @LaurenUnderwood @RepEscobar @senatemajldr A bill that passed the Senate unanimously just before the shutdown surely can get 2/3rds votes in each chamber to override a veto and re-open the government.
@benshapiro What if I told you that you can be religious and still be opposed to discriminating against LGBT Americans.
@PaulSgtstag @DLoesch @ChrisLoesch That is great, I am happy for you, and wish more people were raised the same way. 		If that‚Äôs the case, you should have no problem with a company running an ad encouraging others to be the same sort of upstanding &amp; decent person you are.
@TomiLahren While we‚Äôre at it, Trump‚Äôs tariffs have been an abysmal failure. As has his shutdown.
@mhauschild83 @NippleChops1 @DLoesch The Gillette ad highlights men stepping up and preventing bad behavior. That‚Äôs anything but ‚Äúevil‚Äù. 		If there‚Äôs one takeaway from the Weinstein, Cosby, &amp; the Larry Nassar cases, it‚Äôs that those guys were enabled by a lot of people, &amp; enabling them has failed their victims.
@thelongversion @DLoesch ‚ÄúToxic masculinity‚Äù wasn‚Äôt mentioned once in the ad. The core of the message was don‚Äôt bully, don‚Äôt harass, and don‚Äôt enable those who do - be proactive in preventing it. I‚Äôm not sure why that triggers anyone.
This is the weirdest thing I‚Äôve seen all week. https://t.co/tehv2keydN
When Trump blames the Democrats for the shutdown for not agreeing to his demands on the wall, he is speaking exclusively to the ~35% of voters who support him rain or shine. 		That message does not resonate with independents, and he will lose this fight in the end.
@jsheehan437 @benshapiro True. Though he and others broke off because they felt the Church was not progressive enough on certain social issues. Criticizing an organized religion for not being up to the times on the social consensus on certain issues is very much in the same spirit.
@cwil91 @benshapiro Organized religion is the politicization of spirituality. In any political structure, you will have corruption. 	That‚Äôs not to say political structure isn‚Äôt needed - it‚Äôs essential for religions‚Äô survival. It‚Äôs to say the spiritual message can become tainted for political reasons
@Pontology_ @benshapiro Well therein lies the inconsistency. They‚Äôre not banning people who masturbate in private on their own time, are they? Nor is eating shellfish disqualifying.
@marcorubio @RonDeSantisFL Senate Democrats want the government opened and 800,000 Americans to get their paychecks before moving onto stuff like this. 		And Congress has 100% power to re-open the government and override any veto.
@NippleChops1 @DLoesch You can‚Äôt be deprived of rights, property, or liberty by the government for not calling someone their preferred pronouns. Therefore, it is not an infringement on free speech. 		It is a personal choice on your part whether or not you want to respect them and their wishes.
@benshapiro Not criticizing her for working there. Criticizing the religious doctrine itself for being discriminatory. 		And if that makes me an anti-religious bigot, Martin Luther and other founders of Protestant sects who criticized the Catholic Church would be considered bigots, too.
@NippleChops1 @DLoesch We have to conform to ideas like we should treat women respectfully and not bully people?
@gaedikus @DLoesch The message I got from it is bullying &amp; sexual assault/harassment is beneath true masculinity, and should be separated from it entirely. Quite the opposite message of painting all men as bullies &amp; sexual predators.
@dznyc @mattyglesias The question of the waiver vs the actual qualifications of the nominee given the passage of the waiver are two different issues entirely. 		17 other Senate Democrats who voted against the waiver ended up voting for Mattis. 		The vote against Mattis himself was grandstanding.
@NippleChops1 @DLoesch The snowflake complex exists on the far ends of both sides of the political spectrum. Those on the left upset about ‚Äúmicro-aggressions‚Äù fall into the same category as those on the right who burn sneakers over a Nike endorsement.
@DLoesch Fair enough, what are the disagreements or objections to the commercial‚Äôs theme?
@DLoesch What is behind the right-wing backlash to the Gillette commercial, though. Being outraged for the sake of being outraged?
@dznyc @mattyglesias Civilian control of the military is derived from Presidents being elected by the American people and serving as Commander in Chief. 		7 years retirement time (changed from 10) vs 4 is completely arbitrary and her position on this was nothing more than opportunistic grandstanding.
@NateSilver538 Gillibrand‚Äôs biggest liabilities are not having a real constituency, and an authenticity problem. She wanted to be the most anti-Trump Senator, but when you‚Äôre literally the only Senator who votes against Mattis‚Äô confirmation, it comes off as more self-serving than principled.
@CNNPolitics @leighmunsil Any analysis by Chris Cillizza is overblown.
@brianschatz McConnell can set a vote today to pass a clean CR to re-open the government, and it would easily pass the Senate and the House with 2/3rds majority, overriding a presidential veto. He won‚Äôt do it, though.
@benshapiro Criminal justice reform is the best thing he‚Äôs done. But agreed that SOTU addresses are pretty pointless.

@Buck_72 @NRA Almost. In Saudi Arabia, MBS granted women the right to drive as a propaganda effort to boost his personal image as a ‚Äúreformer‚Äù on the global stage, despite him being just as backwards on human rights.
@NRA The NRA represents the corporate interests of firearm manufacturers, nothing more. 		They advocate for legislation that makes selling guns as easy as possible in order to maximize profits.		They use 2A &amp; fear tactic propaganda to fundraise, which has been drying up significantly.

@Buck_72 @NRA @CrimeResearch1 Michigan is ranked 27 (just on the lower side of the median) and Maryland is ranked 32. Maryland is a blue state and Michigan narrowly voted Trump but is typically on the blueish side of purple. 		For as much attention as Chicago gets, Illinois is ranked 34.

@samsmithxbieber @shaunking @RahmEmanuel Beto got more votes in a midterm than any Democratic presidential nominee in history.

@ACiderDrink Absolutely, activists need to be willing to get in the mud, so the candidates can afford to stay above it. I‚Äôm only talking about decency in the context of a party nominee.
@ACiderDrink Kyrsten Sinema is an example of a candidate who won over 12% of Arizonans who voted for Trump. Her central message was on pocketbook issues like healthcare. That resonated a lot more.
@ACiderDrink Def fair game. I think Beto is another example of a candidate running against someone with high negatives who was effective in attacking them for it, though not at the expense of his campaign‚Äôs central message. Red meat fires up the base, uplifting message inspires new voters.
@NRA Think of your dumbest &amp; least competent coworker. Now imagine them packing heat.
@ACiderDrink No, I think he‚Äôs a great example of the dichotomy of resiliency and decency. He took a jujitsu approach to attacks thrown his way and unapologetically called out the BS when he would see it, but that never derailed his disciplined &amp; largely uplifting message.

So this Veterans Day, if you really want to support our troops and our veterans, reconsider your support of Trump.
‚ÄúBut who cares about any of this? Trump supports the military! He gave them a pay raise!‚Äù		Actually, the pay raise in Obama‚Äôs first year in office was 186% higher than Trump‚Äôs raise. In his 2nd year. It was 142% higher.
Trump‚Äôs response when Sgt. Johnson‚Äôs widow recounted the exchange publicly was to try to discredit her on Twitter and sent his Chief of Staff (a Marine General) to lie about the exchange to the press and on camera.
Then there‚Äôs Sgt. La David Johnson, who is from my city. Trump‚Äôs words of comfort to Sgt. Johnson‚Äôs widow were ‚Äúhe knew what he was getting into.‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt even remember his name when he was speaking to his widow. https://t.co/3IXY9qXcre
While we‚Äôre still on 2016, remember the Khan family? Whose son gave his life for our country. He got in a big political feud with them because they disagreed with his policy to ban people entering this country who shared their late son‚Äôs faith. He attacked a Gold Star family. https://t.co/NKv2uu5hIX
Which gets me to an important point: often products of affluent families like Trump are not the ones who serve in the military. It‚Äôs largely the working class. I‚Äôd have to start an entire new thread to document the times Trump has disrespected or shown disdain for them.
Then, of course, who can forget Trump‚Äôs 2016 campaign when he said of John McCain - a former Prisoner of War and a Vietnam vet - ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a war hero because he was captured. I prefer soldiers that don‚Äôt get captured.‚Äù 		He had a chance to be one of those soldiers, but ‚Äúbone spurs‚Äù.
After this event, Trump refused to meet the arrival of bodies of fallen soldiers at Dover Air Force Base - something Obama would regularly do in the middle of the night. He didn‚Äôt ‚Äúenjoy the experience.‚Äù https://t.co/YCeMdDBFH5
Ryan Owens, a Navy SEAL, was killed in action during this mission. Owens‚Äô father was angry with Trump and refused to meet with him. https://t.co/gm5CJ5P1Vl
Shortly after taking office, Trump made a call for a military raid in the Al Bayda province of Yemen that Obama would not sign off on because he deemed it too risky. Trump approved the mission when he was eating dinner. Michael Flynn was the one who urged Trump to approve it.
To date he has not visited troops in a combat zone overseas - something Obama did within his first 3 months in office and did 4 additional times as president. Because he is afraid to step foot in a combat zone - a fear he‚Äôs held since the Vietnam era.
Trump not attending an event paying respect to fallen soldiers today because it rained is consistent with his frequent disrespect for the military. (A thread):

@shaunking @AndrewGillum There is a recount being triggered by the Agriculture Commissioner race and the Senate race. If any race ends up being within 0.25 (as the Ag Commissioner race will), it will require a hand recount.
@shaunking @AndrewGillum Also there is no way black women - who went for Beto with 95% and Abrams with 97% - only went 82% for Gillum. Something seems off.

@steveschale any thoughts on these numbers?
95% of black women voters voted for Beto. 		97% of black women voted for Stacey Abrams. 		But only 82% of black women voted for Gillum - whose opponent was entangled in more racially-charged controversies than just about anyone in the 2018 cycle?		Something about this seems...off

I love how after Kavanaugh‚Äôs testimony someone changed Wikipedia‚Äôs entry for Devil‚Äôs Triangle to match his description of it as a drinking game but no one thought to update Urban Dictionary. 		#KanavaughHearings #FordHearings
19) My sense is McConnell‚Äôs been wanting to pull Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination for over a week but Trump won‚Äôt let him. If Kavanaugh becomes a KavaNO, expect Trump &amp; McConnell‚Äôs relationship to become toxic. I‚Äôm here for that.
18) Devil‚Äôs. Triangle. Is. Not. A. Drinking. Game.
17) Sen. Kennedy‚Äôs ‚Äúdo you swear to God that you didn‚Äôt do it‚Äù act would‚Äôve been an interesting exercise to do on the hundreds of Catholic priests who presumably believe in God and eternal consequence but have been credibly accused of sexual assault.
16) Kavanaugh taking part in the ‚ÄúRenate Alumni‚Äù thing implies he ‚Äúgot with‚Äù Renate. He testified he didn‚Äôt. So in his youth he was lying about his sexual exploits. If he would lie about his sexual exploits then, what makes us think he won‚Äôt lie about them today?
15) I‚Äôve played many drinking games in my high school, college, and post-collegiate years. ‚ÄúDevil‚Äôs Triangle‚Äù was never one of them.
14) Which brings up a point about sexual assault - many times, especially when the perpetrator is intoxicated, they are unaware that they crossed a line and therefore have their own truth to what happened. Many who go too far are not aware that they did.
13) Kavanaugh is obviously lying about his drinking habits. Understandably so. If he admitted to it, it opens up Pandora‚Äôs Box and the plausibility that he was too drunk to accurately recall what really happened.
12) Subpoena Mark Judge.
11) So is Donald Trump, but again, I digress.
10) That said, Lindsey Graham is a hysterical emotional mess who is unfit and too unstable to serve in public office in any capacity.
9) But I digress. Now onto Kavanaugh: needless to say, if he were a woman, ‚ÄúBridget Kavanaugh‚Äù would‚Äôve been slammed as a hysterical emotional mess who is unfit and too unstable to serve in public office in any capacity.
8) Moving forward with Kavanaugh after today will have devastating political ramifications for Republicans in November.
7) Because in a job interview, the burden of proof is on the applicant. There are dozens of equally qualified ideological clones of Kavanaugh that can easily be confirmed to the Supreme Court. The @FedSoc has a list. Trump even released a list in 2016. Pick one of them.
6) If you were applying for a job and several people came to your prospective employer accusing you of sexual assault, the employer would not spend a nickel, minute, or one iota of energy verifying the claims beyond reasonable doubt. They‚Äôd move onto the next candidate.
5) Kavanaugh is not on trial. His rights and liberties are not in jeopardy. He is in a JOB INTERVIEW. The burden of proof is on HIM to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he is qualified and worthy to serve on the highest pillar of our country‚Äôs judicial branch.
4) That alone raises enough reasonable doubt to deny Kavanaugh a lifetime appointment to the highest judicial body in the country.
3) Even so, Republicans admitted that they found Dr. Ford‚Äôs testimony credible, or didn‚Äôt find any compelling reason not to find it credible. If they were hoping to discredit her, it was an unmitigated disaster for them.
2) It speaks volumes that the Republican members yielded their time to a sex crimes prosecutor to cross examine Dr. Ford but used their own time to apologize to Kavanaugh when he testified. Instead of, you know, using a sex crimes prosecutor to cross someone accused of sex crimes
Takeaways from the #KavanaughHearings and #FordHearings today:		1) Dr. Ford‚Äôs testimony was incredibly compelling, credible, and heartbreaking.
RT @AndreaChalupa: When I confronted the man who sexually assaulted me, he cried just like Kavanaugh.
If you were upset by what you saw today in the #KavanaughHearings, I encourage you to turn that anger into action. Vote, register voters, knock on doors, make sure your friends are voting. 		What we saw today is what happens when the silent majority (non-voters) stay silent.
RT @AdrienneMahsa: Why isn't the sex crimes prosecutor questioning Brett Kavanaugh? 		He's the one accused of sex crimes.

Some of his defenders are saying ‚Äúso what if it‚Äôs true? He was 17 and has changed‚Äù Well, there are people Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs age who are sitting in prison today for crimes they committed as teenagers. So spare me the ‚Äúboys will be boys‚Äù excuse.
That‚Äôs if Dr. Ford‚Äôs story is hypothetically BS. But if it is true, then putting Kavanaugh on the bench is a travesty of justice:
Given that calculus, there is no compelling reason McConnell should want to keep pushing Kavanaugh forward. The only person that‚Äôs good for in the end is potentially Brett Kavanaugh. They‚Äôd do better starting from scratch. Besides, nobody in the GOP really likes him to begin with
Dying on the hill that Kavanaugh should be on the Court is a godsend to vulnerable Democrats like Claire McCaskill, Heidi Heitkamp, and Bill Nelson. This is how the GOP loses the Senate AND the House. They fail to unseat a single Dem and lose AZ &amp; NV.
It spares candidates in tough races the liability of having to defend supporting an alleged sexual predator for the highest court in the land. The GOP candidates in FL, MO, AZ, ND, and MT will be thankful, as will Heller (NV) and Cruz (TX).
For Republicans, short-term embarrassment in pulling a tainted nominee maybe, but long term it is much better for them politically. For one, they can still ram a new nominee thru before the midterm elections. One that‚Äôs likely to the right of Kavanaugh.
Being denied a Supreme Court seat was the same fate Merrill Garland received for the crime of being nominated by a Democratic President. It might not be fair to Kavanaugh, but Supreme Court politics isn‚Äôt fair. That‚Äôs life.
These are pretty ridiculous assumptions, but let‚Äôs play that game and say this story is entirely BS. What is the worst thing that happens to Brett Kavanaugh? - He is denied a seat on the Supreme Court and goes back to a successful career &amp; comfortable life.
6) She‚Äôs willing to do all this, despite full well knowing Kavanaugh will be replaced by an ideological carbon copy from the Federalist List. Likely by someone even more conservative than him.
5) In the name of stopping Brett Kavanaugh, Dr. Ford - a feminist - is willing to discredit the #MeToo movement and all progress women have made in standing up to sexual assault and holding perpetrators accountable.
4) She is willing to be utterly humiliated on the national stage and dragged by the media.
3) She is willing to lie to the FBI, which is a federal felony. The same crime that notable Mueller investigation convicts Michael Flynn, George Papadopoulos, and Alex Van der Zwaan are headed to jail for. She is willing to go to prison to soil the good name of Brett Kavanaugh.
2) She is willing to put her career in jeopardy and potentially ruin relationships with friends and family members who may not like her coming forward with such allegations.
Let‚Äôs entertain the idea that Dr. Ford is fabricating everything and Kavanaugh is totally innocent. To do this we have to make a few pretty wild assumptions. 		1) She is willing to upend her life as she knows it, receiving everything from hate mail to death threats.

@ryanegorman Completely agree that it backfired spectacularly, I just think that‚Äôs what his plan was &amp; it was intentional. Gillum has already been dominating the news cycle w/ his historic primary win, this was a way for DeSantis to reassert himself into the narrative, trying Trump‚Äôs playbook
@ryanegorman It accomplishes a few things 1) takes up all oxygen in news cycle, preventing his opponent from effectively getting his message out. 2) rallies his base by playing the political correctness victimization card 3) Increases name recognition. It‚Äôs a brilliant way to self-promote.
@ryanegorman It was designed to be an obvious racial slur where he could deny intent, drum up controversy &amp; have his supporters cry foul on political correctness, &amp; dominate the news cycle. Capturing news cycles with controversy at the expense of a substantive campaign worked for Trump in 16.

Tomorrow is the first day of early voting in Broward County, and if you‚Äôre a Florida Democrat I hope you join me in voting for @SShawFL for Attorney General!

@VicDaring Not jabbing the opposition, but conveying that moral urgency to respective constituencies. Top of the ticket mobilizes progressives, bottom of the ticket speaks to those independents &amp; disaffected conservatives. It could be a moment of political realignment &amp; healing.
@VicDaring Idk his personal politics. McRaven‚Äôs praise of Obama &amp; admonishing Trump certainly had more to do w/ their leadership styles rather than policy, but few convey a sense of greater moral urgency in the Trump era than anti-Trump ex-Republicans (Steve Schmidt, Dave Jolly)
