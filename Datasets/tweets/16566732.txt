@chuckfeerick @thadd_f HP, due to its price, generally draws an empty nest crowd. Parts of HP are still fun for mid 20s, but not walkable
@chuckfeerick @thadd_f that block is about 4 blocks south of OTR, and actually in the central business district. That area is more mid 20s..
@thadd_f @chuckfeerick To clarify: depends on what you want. HP is suburban. OTR is urban. HP is rich. OTR is newly redeveloping
@thadd_f @chuckfeerick Def. Main St. You'll pay a lot more in HP, and it caters to an older crowd. OTR is much younger & w. more to do

@BruceMcF Gotta go now. Good discussion. Stay in touch.
@BruceMcF I beamoan that rail, highspeed & otherwise, would miss downtown at any time. I want it now - would settle for later to get it done
@BruceMcFI hear ya Bruce, and I agree to build now and fix later. I just want to keep downtown Cincinnati in the dialogue.
@BruceMcF I agree on both points. My point is that if you are going to trim, don't 'trim' the core of the largest population center of Ohio
RT @jaketapper: Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death panels... #hcrpoems
@BruceMcF From what I hear, the stop is in Sharonville, not Union Terminal or Waterfront
@BruceMcF True re: population. The econ. benefits of placing the stop downtown are immense though, moreso than if it is out in the burbs
@not_tonight00 crummy, eh? How great would it be if it came to Union Terminal! Could then connect via @cincystreetcar to rest of downtown
I just got called a nerd by @jkevinwright, whose pic is of Woody Allen. That stings.
@onthe10brink @backstop440 The proposed 3C line is a step toward high speed, but not high-speed itself. Either way, it needs to be downtown
@BruceMcF "Sharonville" is not Cincinnati. Close? Yes. Adequate? Perhaps. Cincinnati? No.
@not_tonight00 current plans have the "Cincinnati" stop in Sharonville. It needs to be at Union Terminal.
I just got RT by @TarbellTweets. My day is made!
