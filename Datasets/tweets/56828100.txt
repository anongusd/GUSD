50 years after #King led this movement, sought to open this new chapter in the fight for economic justice and civil rights, we would not properly celebrate Dr. King‚Äôs birthday if we did not talk about and understand his last campaign. #MLKDay
He reached out to those who represented the rural, impoverished whites of Kentucky &amp; Tennessee &amp; West Virginia. #DrKing sought to bring all of them together and the plan was to have a mass demonstration in the summer of 1968 called Resurrected City and the Poor People‚Äôs Campaign.
#DrKing wanted to bring together poor white people with poor Black people with poor Latinos for a campaign for economic justice, regardless of color. #MLKDay

If any police department wants to be successful in serving the community, follow the playbook of Chief Richard J. Pennington.
Wherever he went, he got results. Wherever he went, he worked with the community.
Chief Pennington did phenomenal work not only in New Orleans, but also in Washington, D.C., and Atlanta.
I have said that Chief Pennington was the best police chief NOLA ever had, but I amend that: He was the best chief America has ever had.
