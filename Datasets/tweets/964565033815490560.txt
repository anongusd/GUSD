(6) Trouble is that those flooding into our country are coming to take advantage of the generosity of the American people, without ant intent to return the favor!		We are a generous people, but we're not a stupid people. Politicians should keep that in mind when espousing views.
(5) Even now, should people from anywhere need help, we stand ready to help. Whether they flee a disaster man made or natural, we would welcome them.		Asking only if they want to be American they leave the flag of their home country behind, learn English, and be willing to work.
(4) When my folks needed help, there were those that helped them and whether they were giving help or accepting help, it was debt to be paid, and always was.		Im confident that they and most of the citizens here now would accept, open armed, ANYONE from anywhere IF they need help
(3) They worked hard, fought when they had to, and helped build this country to be what it is today.		They welcomed those from all around the world that had come with the same dream and sometimes those not strong enough to survive without help.
(2) My ancestors were immigrants, which means they weren't here when the Colonist took their leave from the tyranny of England. But when they came...through Ellis Island...the only thing they expected from America was a chance.		They had to provide for themselves in every way.
(1) It's becoming more and more obvious that people, either because they have no history in this country or they ignore the sacrifices of those that have come before them made, run, or attempt to run this country. 		They seek the moral higher ground by digging deeper holes...
