The US should never involve itself in a civil war, says @JohnKasich. Criticizes Clinton's time as Sec of State, and actions in Libya
Kasich suggests Apple and intel community should  collaborate on making the nation secure. Also jokes abt putting Hannity in room w them
Kasich agrees with Hannity that ISIS is evil. Suggests getting Arabs and western allies. We need to lead, but not be global cop

The problem we have today is that a lot of retirees are living longer, says @JohnKasich . We innovate, he says, waving Hannity's iPhone
There is no third rail, Kasich says of Social Security. If you think there is a third rail, don't run.
When I left Washington, we had a projected $5 trillion surplus, Kasich says. He didn't think folks could spend it. But they did.
Hannity asks if supporters of lead candidate will be mad if the brokered convention doesn't select that leader.

We will rebuild America and make it the best it's ever been, he says, as Sean Hannity joins him on stage. They are sitting down together
Fight poverty, train people on welfare, encourage young people. Join a mentoring program. Get kids to see future. Believe in selves not govt
Kasich gets lapplause when he urges people to fix problems where they live, in their own communities, not rely on the govt.
Everyone is made special by the Lord, says Kasich, as part of a giant mosaic. And the strength of our country doesn't come from Washington
"Bringing people together works," said Kasich, who claims that's why he won election in Ohio - not his opponent's implosion.
Kasich is also discussing his compassion for the mentally ill &amp; working poor. That would make him a compassionate conservative.
@JohnKasich is talking a lot about Reagan and Kemp, to establish his conservative cred.
Says he breaks into a cold sweat whenever he comes to Washington.
Now he's getting into his days on the House Budget Committee. Year after year after year, he says, he fought the establishment &amp; status quo
Kasich calls himself a "freedom fighter," pacing across the stage with his microphone rather than standing behind a podium.
Discusses how he was only Republican to defeat an incumbent Democrat in 1982, running on a conservative message.
Kasich is discusses his youth campaigning for Reagan during his youth. Calls himself a change agent who doesn't take lobbyists' order
I am not seeing lots of people waving placards in here. Maybe security has confiscated them. Kasich is in a checked shirt, no tie.
Ron Christie talks about how Kasich inherited an $8 billion budget hole, now has a surplus. "Something is working in the Buckeye State."
The anti-abortion panel is over at #CPAC. @johnkasich is scheduled next. Ron Christie is introducing him. A former staffer for Kasich
The #CPAC panel before @JohnKasich is focused on the evils of assisted suicide, abortion &amp; embryonic stem cell research
Security at #CPAC is tight, complete with frisking, bag searches &amp; sniffing dogs for  bags and computer equipment.
Tired of Donald Trump, our Republican debate watchers preferred John Kasich and Ted Cruz https://t.co/vbcwgCadNm
Any thoughts yet on who's doing best in the debate so far? Is it @realDonaldTrump? @marcorubio perhaps? @tedcruz or @JohnKasich ?
@jeremytnoll Who is calling you names and insulting you for not supporting Trump?
@acfurey40 @jeremytnoll @joyceabanjac @GrCleYR Are you all getting sick of Trump? Your comments sound like it.
How do you think Kasich's pitch is going, now that he finally has the mike?
@acfurey40 They are yelling at each other quite a bit.
@jennydemonte I hope it keeps you entertained. This year's GOP crop has above average amusement value.

@GrCleYR Have there been too many of these debates? Is it getting annoyingly repetitive?

How do you think the moderators are doing? Are they on-target, or focusing on things voters won't care about?
Maybe I'm interested in this NY thing because I grew up there. What did you think of Trump's response to Cruz' NY values attack?
Which of the governors do you think is coming off the best?

@drywells2 Yes, a lot of people seemed to think their questions were sub-par. I did not think they came off well, personally.
Paul Ryan describes Boehner as a class act and truly a "gentleman from Ohio"
Mitt Romney is in the House Gallery to watch his veep nominee installed as House Speaker
All Ohio's Republicans backed Paul Ryan for Speaker of the House of Representatives
Ohio's @RepTimRyan announced that while he loves the name Ryan, he's voting for Nancy Pelosi for speaker. Paul Ryan will win w/o him.

What did you guys like about Christie?
@acfurey40 He also got in the last words, "God bless, America"
OK - it's time for the big question: Which candidates fared best and worst in this debate &amp; why?
I guess @marcorubio must be a @Jim_Jordan  fan, since he just applauded the points he made during last week's @HillaryClinton hearing
@acfurey40 Those decisions are above my pay grade, I'm afraid.
Any thoughts on how frontrunner Ben Carson fared in that round of questioning?
Do you folks think these moderators seemed more intent on picking fights between the candidates than the moderators of the prior debates?
What do you folks think of Ted Cruz' attack on the media? Don't feel the need to spare my feelings because I am part of the media.
@ChrisSchmittEsq @CarlyFiorina @HP How do you think she handled it? I am sure she rehearsed those questions. She seemed to get applause
Do you think Kasich came out better in his exchange with @realDonaldTrump and @realbencarson or did either trump him?
Kasich is definitely getting his time in. Now @realDonaldTrump is going after him on Lehman brothers &amp; attributes Ohio's boom to fracking
@acfurey40 I thought it was interesting how the various candidates did or didn't address it.
I love how they say "The Republican presidential debate begins right now," and then we switch to commercials.
@jeremytnoll Maybe they'll get into that, since this is at a college
@acfurey40 Right now, it is just predebate yakking . They are not being punctual with this.
@jeremytnoll Trump &amp; Carson actually threatened to boycott this debate if it wasn't kept to 2 hours. https://t.co/3TJROOC2Dw
@acfurey40 @ChrisSchmittEsq Yes, but aren't candidates on the warpath more fun to watch?
@jeremytnoll It's supposed to be two hours. We appreciate you taking the time to watch it and comment.
@ChrisSchmittEsq I would not be surprised if many of the other candidates with low poll numbers go on the warpath, hoping for a breakout.

@tpietrocola  You think @FoxNews is on the warpath against Trump. Anyone you think they are building up?
@joyceabanjac The question needed to be asked. If @realDonaldTrump becomes President, he can't indulge in trashtalk of world leaders
@ChrisSchmittEsq You're right! Did you hear Jeb Bush talk about his service in a purple state?
@acfurey40 But he's seeking the Republican nomination. Will Republican voters want to support someone who takes that position?
Whoa. What do you think of @realDonaldTrump being unwilling to say he won't run make an independent run if he's not the GOP nominee.

@ChrisSchmittEsq @GOP Bashing Hillary Clinton is probably something the GOP candidates &amp; party faithful agree on.
@jeremytnoll Do you think enough people are watching the earlier debate for what they say to make a difference?
@jeremytnoll Why do you think @GovernorPerry would be a better candidate than Christie? You can still watch him at the earlier event.
@acfurey40 That'll be great. We look forward to having everyone on board then. And if folks want to get going early, that's fine, too.
@ChrisSchmittEsq : @realDonaldTrump probably has a financial incentive to keep going as long as possible. It boosts his reality show brand
@ChrisSchmittEsq Given his self-funding, do you think @realDonaldTrump would quit if his poll numbers drop, or pull a Ross Perot?
@ChrisSchmittEsq In 2012, it seemed GOPs flirted w/a bunch of faves that rapidly fell by the wayside. Who do you think will be next in 2016?
