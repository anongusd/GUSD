@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Mr.@Jim_Jordan , the president will now see you in his office. https://t.co/4we8nJnwgD
@VP @CBP What about weast? https://t.co/122UfQe0dm
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS Oh Jimmy.
@Jim_Jordan @MariaBartiromo Oh Jimmy.
@RepRaskin He shouldn’t resign.
@RepMarkWalker @RepLeeZeldin @RalphNortham This is very misleading and quite frankly stupid. Please stop. If you wanna say something on the matter, use quotes moving forward.
@TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Please stop. Stop. Quit.
@KyleKashuv That’s not true by any standard. That just merely happened on the same day but are in no way related. Very misleading.
@Joselyn43193765 @papickergreg @marklutchman https://t.co/QMs0h6iiRT
@KaitMarieox Doesn’t everyone’s “paychecks come from someone else's paychecks?” That’s how we move money around in our economy. What a world we live in where we accept that.
@c_dunleavy @stevekweiss @AngelaGuilmenot @KamalaHarris That’s true, provides that are stipulations. To that end, my point wasn’t that state spending is like grocery shopping. What I am saying is that we should be more aware of our spending habits and allocation of funds.
@c_dunleavy @stevekweiss @AngelaGuilmenot @KamalaHarris How so?
@c_dunleavy @stevekweiss @AngelaGuilmenot @KamalaHarris Thanks mate, I was explaining it in Laymen’s terms through an analogy https://t.co/zoV8MUzVwX
@RepMarkGreen Also, I’ll draw your attention to the children in camps and, in certain cases, cages. “Are we going to allow this affront to our civilization to happen unchecked? If so, we’ve lost our soul. I am appalled.”
@RepMarkGreen Please stop. This is either intentionally misleading or it shows that you didn’t do your due diligence and read the whole thing. Read, comprehend, educate yourself.
@RepMcEachin Before pumping money into infrastructure, we should fortify the structure of our educational model. Standardize learning materials and make sure children can all keep up through the required support.
@c_dunleavy @stevekweiss @AngelaGuilmenot @KamalaHarris More doesn’t mean better. I could go to the store and get $100 worth of groceries or get $100 worth of candy. In which situation would I be better prepared, say for a snow storm? We have to be more conscious of our spending “habits.”
@AngelaGuilmenot @stevekweiss @KamalaHarris You know why that is? Public schools are mostly funded through property taxes. This means that if you live in a nicer neighborhood where the price of homes is above that of the surrounding neighborhoods, the public school will be, as you say, “fine.”
@GovMattBevin Remember migrant kids in camps and cages?                                                                                 This is a sad commentary on the culture of bigotry that continues to creep insidiously into the laws/policies of our county...
@RepByrne You do understand how misleading and divisive this is, correct?
@tedlieu Weird flex, but okay!
@RepHastingsFL @RepRobWoodall Our educational system should be the first to experience reform (standardize the educational system) before any policy of this nature is proposed.
@RepHastingsFL @RepRobWoodall The problem with this whole notion is the decentralized role of the Government in regards to education. While the DoE oversees some/most aspects, it is fairly weak in terms of policy implementation and funding of this kind.
@RepKevinBrady @RepAndyBarr I don’t quite agree with your analysis. You say that “Barriers work to stop illegal crossings on border.” I see the data and come to a different conclusion. My conclusion is that, relatively, Border Patrol hasn’t been apprehending as many immigrants-less come or less are caught.
@TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump From your question, I can, without a doubt, establish the fact that, internally, you acknowledge the problem of global warming, given that you state: “...changes in the [Earth’s] climate over time...”
@TheRightMelissa @carlosalazraqui @realDonaldTrump Not as good as they could be doing, thanks for asking!  https://t.co/ej5fOHlaYK
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump @60Minutes It’s more of an admission of guilt, tbh.
@realDonaldTrump @60Minutes You mean had, Obama is out of the office and you’re there now.
@KamalaHarris Poorly executed cliché; it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump One of the two, I’ll let you pick, is not in their job description.
@realDonaldTrump BITCH CUNT!
@BeverlyWhetsell @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Also, you’re attacking him personally and not presenting your arguments in a succinct manner. Who’s who? Who’s what?
@TWIT_ANTHONY @realDonaldTrump Just think about what you wrote... “He will cause a huge emergency if he has to...” https://t.co/gnWOn7aazJ
@EnricoP06573822 @March_for_Life @xan_desanctis “We are on a mission from God.” Anyways, Iit appears that your belief against abortion is intertwined with your religious beliefs.
@KamalaHarris Senator, respectfully, you should not run this year. While your effort to be the change is noted, this is not the correct time for everyone to try and step up. If we want positive change, we need to unify for the sake of our posterity and country.
@TheRightMelissa I don’t think I’ve see a good answer to the following question, so if you please, have a crack at it: How exactly does a wall solve the problem of Drugs &amp; drug cartels, Gangs &amp; criminals, sex and child trafficking?
@realDonaldTrump Maybe, and just maybe, we should try a different approach, one that has “reform” at its foundation instead of concrete.
@realDonaldTrump Fixed it for ya, dude!!!  Only fools, or people with a political agenda, want a Wall or Steel Barrier to separate our Country from our neighbors. Crime, Drugs and Human Trafficking will happen - it always does!
@EnricoP06573822 @March_for_Life @xan_desanctis I agree that people have Freedom of Religion and Freedom of Speech. What I disagree on is the fact that just because it is expressed in the Bible, it should be a law.  First and foremost, your own words forge this argument. There are some religions that do not oppose abortion.
@SRweak @TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump They have.
@TheRightMelissa @realDonaldTrump Hear me out on this one... okay? If everyone had guaranteed housing with a bed, a working bathroom and kitchen, this wouldn’t happen?
@thethriftygene @TerryDycus @ifonlyifthen @ReverbPlayer @jaketapper @FoxNews Everyone is responsible to an extent. But the truth of the matter is Nick is a proxy to a bigger problem. His behavior is nothing more than a reflection of his upbringing, his parents, his school and his education. Something only he can change. His actions speak for themselves.
@jaketapper To disengage is to extend your hand, shake, and then turn to walk away. To engage is to stand there and smile for a long time.
@mayaizellah_ Why not treat all children equally? Give every mother equal access to good hospitals and good healthcare centers without the burden of price looming over their heads. Let’s keep children with their families and not separate in holding camps. Would be a good start.
@EnricoP06573822 @March_for_Life @xan_desanctis We are on a mission for the American people, not god. The Bible should not be in this conversation.
@SenatorLankford It’s not a sad day, it’s Friday. The way to uplift &amp; support women should be by letting them choose. We should also draw attention towards the living condition of children who are here currently as well. Children do not belong in camps and/or cages.
@ErickaAndersen @March_for_Life This seems more like a reflection of Chinese birth control policies and the Chinese Government itself.
@clevetidwellusa @realDonaldTrump Sooooo let me get this straight. If the President doesn’t get it his way through BIPARTISANSHIP, he’ll have it his way anyways? “Either you come to my terms or we’ll have it my way anyways.” — That’s a very bold statement.
@realDonaldTrump Your first statement is extremely misleading. “We have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the Government.” It should say: “I have come to terms and agreed with the Democrats, Republicans and Independents to TEMPORARILY open the government for three weeks.”
