“Until a few years ago, I didn’t think this was a very complicated subject; The Luddites were wrong and the believers in technology and technological progress were right,” Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary, said. “I’m not so completely certain now.”
"Something different is going on in our current technological revolution. In a new study, David Autor of MIT and Anna Salomons of Utrecht University found that over the last 40 years, jobs have fallen in every single industry that introduced technologies to enhance productivity."
"The 58 most productive industries in Phoenix employed only 162,000 people in 2017, 14,000 more than in 2010. Employment in the 58 industries with the lowest productivity, where it tops out at $65,000 per worker, grew 10 times as much over the period, to 673,000."

"McKinsey’s consultants instructed Purdue Pharma on how to 'turbocharge' sales of OxyContin, how to counter efforts by drug enforcement agents to reduce opioid use, &amp; were part of a team that looked at how 'to counter emotional messages from mothers w/ teenagers that overdosed.'"
And here's the company that helped Purdue and the Sacklers cash in on the epidemic: McKinsey Consulting. Which "recommended that Purdue redirect its sales force to focus on esp prolific prescribers of OxyContin." https://t.co/J2QFQexRpB

Actual language from the State of Massachusetts' lawsuit against Purdue Pharma: “Eight people in a single family made the choices that caused much of the opioid epidemic." Stunning.
"McKinsey recommended that Purdue redirect its sales force to focus on esp prolific prescribers of OxyContin. One slide attributed to McKinsey focused on one doctor in Wareham, Mass., who almost doubled his Oxy prescriptions after a big increase in visits from Purdue sales reps."
"McKinsey’s consultants instructed Purdue Pharma on how to 'turbocharge' sales of OxyContin, how to counter efforts by drug enforcement agents to reduce opioid use and were part of a team that looked at how “to counter emotional messages from mothers w/ teenagers that overdosed."

@nhannahjones @dblock94 In general, the message of the new piece seems very worth endorsing: it is essentially calling on Democrats and liberals elsewhere to care about the fate of precisely the heavily-black interior cities that are often left out of the rural, white-working-class Trumpland coverage.
@nhannahjones @dblock94 FWIW, this article from a few years ago on the fate of St Louis is really good at explaining how economic concentration (and federal policy) contributed to the decline of that city: https://t.co/my1kjoGVRp
@nhannahjones @dblock94 And while deindustrialization played a big part in these cities' decline, as the article notes, deindustrialization also devastated some of today's winner cities, like Boston &amp; NY. The question is why the new economy that followed has concentrated growth so much in those cities.
@nhannahjones @dblock94 Absolutely, white flight had a huge impact on these cities. But as others have noted, the numbers in the article are metro-area numbers. So the stagnation of these cities relative to coastal ones includes the whole metro area, both the urban core and white-flight suburbs.

@DanaHoule Of course the fundamental problem is that WY=CA &amp; ND=NY.  But I don't see the constitutional convention coming to fix outrage. So the only alternative is to win Senate seats in heartland--lots of them, regularly. And as @dblock94 argues, that means addressing regional inequality.
Minor correction here: the growth rates being contrasted are for metro population size, not GDP.
@sbbaines @dblock94 That's precisely the idea.
@DanaHoule .@dblock94 isn't saying she did badly in those metros. He's saying that if those metros made up more of those states--if you had Denver or Northern Virginia like metro growth in the Midwest--she'd have won them.
@DanaHoule I disagree. Yes, they did well in the Great Lakes Senate races this year. But how do you hope to hold a Senate majority long term if MO, IN and the Dakotas are a lost cause? Meanwhile, many Dems urging Brown not to run for WH bc he's "the only guy who can hold Ohio Senate seat."
18) In conclusion, Dems “need to vigorously enforce policies that make America’s purple &amp; red state metro areas too big &amp; too vibrant for Republicans to ignore or suppress.” But that requires caring about regional inequality—even if you live in a city at the winning end. 		-30-
17) How much would Dems benefit from stronger, bigger heartland cities? Get this: even white voters w/o college degrees—Trump’s base—lean Dem when they live in cities. “Even if you look at white non-college voters, the closer you get to the city, they tend to be more Democratic.”
16) Instead, they often bask triumphant. “It'd seem obvious that liberals should be keenly interested in promoting policies that would equalize geographic opportunity. Yet what you tend to hear instead is smug satisfaction about the economic superiority of liberal big cities.”
15) Bottom line, “if the party can’t find policy levers to boost growth rates—and hence the # of Dem voters—in purple &amp; red state metro areas, they'll have hard time overcoming the R advantage in Senate and EC. Yet almost no one on left talks as if they understand this reality.”
14) When we debate housing costs, we overlook regional inequality. “It’s not that they have too many white-collar working professionals moving into once-affordable communities. It’s they have too many white-collar working professionals, period. Stagnant cities don’t have enough.”
13) Fixing this also helps liberals personally, “by making it easier for talented people to stay with family and friends where they grew up, or to move wherever else they might like to go, rather than being channeled to a handful of overly expensive, traffic-choked megacities.”
12) ...which has "stripped those interior cities of what were once their economic engines, even as it has enriched the already wealthy coastal megalopolises.”
11) What sort of choices? Weakening anti-trust enforcement. Allowing airlines to decrease service to many interior cities. Broadly, “giving large banks &amp; other corporations in elite coastal cities free rein to acquire rival firms headquartered in cities in America’s interior..."
10) And doing so means recognizing that regional inequality is not inevitable or an accident. “Nothing makes people in St. Louis or Milwaukee any less talented than people in San Francisco or Washington, D.C.” It's “the result of nearly 4 decades of policy choices in Washington.”
9) Or consider if those cities had grown like Denver, whose growth has turned CO blue. “To avoid watching in horror as Senate slips away forever while EC map becomes ever more daunting, liberals need...to combat the decline of heartland cities—to turn Clevelands into Denvers.”
8) Consider the contrast of WI and MN. In both states, rural voters swung to the right in 2016. But Minneapolis’ economy has grown nearly 10X Milwaukee’s since 1970. “If metro Milwaukee had grown at the same rate as Minneapolis, Clinton would have carried WI by approx 16K votes."
7) Coastal concentration does Dems little good in presidential, either. “Trump eked out victories in EC–rich midwestern states like MI, WI &amp; PA. These states still have large metro areas, and Clinton won those regions. But they have grown very modestly or declined in population.”
6) Meanwhile, Dem strength in wealthy metros is, for Senate purposes, essentially wasted. “Democrats managed to flip 4 seats and thus win every House district in fast-growing Orange County, CA....But when it comes to the Senate, it changes nothing. California was already blue.”
5) "...but metro areas in traditional swing states away from the coasts generally haven’t been growing much in recent decades, leaving the populations of those states skewing much more rural than they otherwise would."
4) Well, points 1, 2, and 3 are linked. “The GOP’s disproportionate Senate representation and the clustering of economic opportunity in elite coastal metro areas are closely related. Democrats won big in cities and suburbs all over the country..."
3) Meanwhile, the Democrats have a clear problem in the Senate: "Thanks to a 'blue wave' of support, Democrats picked up 40 seats in the House, taking control of the chamber. Yet despite the Dems’ 9-point advantage in the national vote, the GOP gained a net of two Senate seats."
2) In the 1960s, the 25 richest cities in the country included Milwaukee, Cleveland, and Des Moines. In 2018, “20 of the top 25 were on the East or West Coast. Seven are in California. Minneapolis, which clocks in at number 24, is the only entrant from the entire Midwest.”
1) We talk a lot about growing income inequality between classes. But inequality is also growing between cities: “In 1980, the per capita income in the richest 10 percent of metro areas was 1.4 times greater than in the poorest 10 percent. By 2014, it was 1.7 times greater.”

@AdotSad It wasn't a matter of how the legislation was written (other challenges of the law had to do with the text.) There's strong speculation that Kagan and Breyer voted with the conservatives to kill Medicaid expansion in exchange for Roberts upholding the law.
It's worth noting again that one of the most consequential recent SCOTUS rulings was the 7-2 block of ACA's mandatory Medicaid expansion. The ACA's whole underlying purpose was to expand coverage in states where elected officials don't care about the poor. The ruling undid that.

"He is barefoot, wearing a T-shirt that says 'spiritual gangster.' He gestures at his expansive view, w/ undisguised satisfaction, and says, “Look at this. Wow.” He pans the camera across the sky, which is starting to bruise red &amp; violet in the twilight. 'So grateful,' he says."
"On Sunday afternoons, Burnett likes to pour himself a generous glass of wine and stroll out onto the balcony of his seven-thousand-square-foot home, off the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu... 'Lazy Sunday afternoon,' Burnett says in one [Instagram post]..."
@joshtpm The piece gives the impression that Burnett exists on a plane of self-absorption that almost transcends politics. He didn't even know about the Parkland massacre!
“People are making it seem like Mark’s ignoring evil. But I think it’s more benign than that—and scarier, in a way. He doesn’t care."
"Burnett’s silence 'is abdication. It’s collusion. It’s being complicit, just like an Ivanka Trump. I’m very disappointed in Mark for that.'"
“I think the reality for Mark Burnett is he’s a Hollywood guy. He probably feels that if he torpedoes Donald Trump he’ll torpedo a part of his own legacy. And it’s funny, because he has enough money and enough power in Hollywood that he could actually afford to speak up.”
I can't overstate how many Trump voters I spoke with in 2016 cited the Apprentice as reason for believing he could fix the country.

“Instead of fighting this concentrated corporate power, many leading Democrats embraced and continue to embrace an economic ideology centered on efficiency that paved the way for the merger mania and manufacturing exodus that’ve been at root of rural America’s economic undoing.”
“It is no surprise that many of those who remain in these communities have lost any sense of respect, dignity, and self-determination.”
“Manufacturing and farming jobs have left the area, and opportunities — to change jobs, start your own business, fund good schools, and build communities where your kids can thrive and start their own families — are the exception, not the rule.”
“Over the course of a generation, major sectors of the rural economy have been rolled up and are now controlled by a handful of predatory, extractive multinational corporations.”

@AlexDanielsCOP @washingtonpost Who needs a charitable deduction for your private-equity winnings when you already have the carried-interest loophole? https://t.co/2TJoHUyUPW
Here's my 2016 piece on Rubestein, "patriotic philanthropy," and his role in preserving the carried-interest tax loophole for private equity firms: https://t.co/2TJoHUyUPW
"One woman suffered 3 falls, multiple infections, dehydration and bedsores; a liver cancer patient had fallen 6 times, [once] while reaching for his urine bag; and another broke his hip when aides were moving him to be weighed, but had to wait 2 hours before taken to a hospital."
"In addition, Carlyle receives annual 'advisory fees' from the companies that it purchases — essentially, Carlyle pays itself to manage the companies it owns. At ManorCare, those fees [amounted to] about $27 million. That money was also distributed to Carlyle and its investors."
"Carlyle made money from its investment in other ways, too. It took at least $80 million from the HCR ManorCare venture in the form of various fees. Most of that was a 'transaction fee,' which is money Carlyle receives when it buys a company."
“Carlyle was a very interesting group to deal with,” said Andrew Porch, a consultant on quality statistics. “They’re all bankers and investment people. We had some very tough conversations where they did not know a thing about this business at all.”
“He was sitting there in a wheelchair naked, with just a blanket on him — no pants, no underpants,” said Maldonado, whose father, a former factory worker, was at the Pottsville home. “He got bedsores, infections &amp; he had a couple of falls. It was like they'd never check on him.”
"The rise in health-code violations at the chain began after Carlyle and investors completed a 2011 financial deal that extracted $1.3 billion from the company for investors but also saddled the chain with what proved to be untenable financial obligations."
"The number of citations increased for neither preventing nor treating bed sores; medication errors; not providing proper care for people who need special services such as injections, colostomies and prostheses; and not assisting patients with eating and personal hygiene."
"The number of health-code violations found at the chain each year rose 26 percent between 2013 and 2017. The yearly number of health-code violations at company nursing homes rose from 1,584 to almost 2,000."
Private-equity titan David Rubenstein has enjoyed glowing press for his DC philanthropy.

@zackstanton @karavoght Good point. Here's one explanation: Unions are so worried about OH going RTW, and so pessimistic about Dem prospects, that they pulled punches in a lot of races, siding with Republican legislators in hopes of forestalling disaster. Shrewd realpolitik or self-fulfilling prophecy?
Addendum: it's worth noting that the rise of Trumpism in Ohio is especially striking in light of the state's past as a beacon of northern progressivism: ALL BUT ONE of Ohio's 24 members of Congress voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
@ahazlett As it happens, I reviewed the book: https://t.co/fOgNoa38vE. It's very relevant to Ohio, given how much fracking is growing there.
@nbeaudrot True, to a point. Pretty sure Mahoning Valley counts as northern OH, and the slippage continues there. Really hard for Dems to win Ohio without Mahoning.
@Tylerjoelb Very good point. ICYMI, I did a big piece on the drug courts in SE Ohio last year: https://t.co/eiTZWMrH4F
@QHeilbroner Yes, please do.
@craigcalcaterra Mention of 2006 was meant only as a reminder that past Democratic wave years produced actual big gains in Ohio, too, unlike this year. Understood that there were particulars at play in that race.
Columbus (and Cleveland and Cincinnati) can only deliver so many votes. And being so clustered in Columbus also limits one’s perspective. It’s hard to understand how rough things are getting elsewhere, what people are up against. 	And they’re getting pretty rough. 	-30-
Regional inequality is creating big winners and losers even at the state level. It’s benefiting Democrats personally in the sense that they are increasingly concentrated in the winner cities. But it’s not helping them politically in state like Ohio.
And the place to start with that work may be in all those small cities. This is one of the things that Sherrod Brown, who is from Mansfield, seems to grasp more than many other Dems. And it’s not just about going TO those places, but getting charismatic people FROM them to run.
So many big-city Dems respond by declaring it all a lost cause—those people are beyond hope. But it’s not about getting all of “those people.” It’s only about getting enough to keep from getting killed at the state or district level.
But it’s not just about truly rural counties. It’s also about all those small postindustrial cities, where Dems have been losing ground but which new research shows remain more receptive: https://t.co/2aTrnOQLfE
If the party is still going to give Ohio a shot, it’s going to mean reckoning in a serious way with the gathering crisis in rural America, as @mattstoller argues here: https://t.co/93gAE9bN6T and @mtomasky argues here: https://t.co/frmKR6vEP3
So how should Dems think about all this? It’s tempting to cut the state out of 2020 plans—after all, Trump won it by 8, and Dems don’t really need it to win. But it seems hard to imagine how Dems could ever hold Senate and House majorities without still being competitive in Ohio.
How big was the rural surge for Ohio Republicans? Cordray actually got more votes than Kasich did in winning in 2014. But it still wasn’t enough: https://t.co/DbhGxlYnMH. DeWine won more than 70 percent of the vote in 15 counties!
I was in rural SE Ohio Tuesday and the monolithic Republican support was palpable. In 2012, Obama won almost 40 percent in Meigs County. But Hillary got only 23 percent in 2016. Cordray brought that up to only 29 percent this week.
Ohio has an astonishing array of these small cities and towns—all with handsome old courthouses, coherent downtowns and grand Victorians, and almost all of them in a condition that breaks your heart. And that’s not to mention the truly desperate rural areas of southern &amp; SE Ohio.
This regional inequality worsens matters for the rest of the state, as more and more young people head to Columbus for Ohio State or other opportunities and don’t return, a dynamic that @jdvance1 and others have lamented.
Beyond Columbus, the state has been HAMMERED by manufacturing losses since 2000. “The trajectory of Columbus diverged dramatically. Its economic &amp; population growth masked some of the challenges facing much of the state when looking at state-level trends.” https://t.co/nvt9tERND5
These facts may seem at odds with all the buzz around Columbus. But Columbus stands in stark contrast to midsize cities like Akron, Toledo and Dayton, and esp to small cities like Mansfield, Lancaster, Zanesville, Portsmouth, Springfield, Middletown, Chillicothe, Lorain, etc.
The state also tilts old. Only 750K of those registered to vote are between 18-24 compared to the 3.2 million who are 55 and over: https://t.co/W06RVC7tE3
That’s partly because of brain drain—college grads leaving the state. But it’s also because the state’s investment in education has fallen way off. In the past decade, it actually declined: https://t.co/TMTLdxoTRn
What could be driving such a transformation? Well, for one thing, demographics. As the share of white non-college voters drops nationwide, it’s holding strong in Ohio. The state is 82 percent white and only 28 percent of Ohioans have completed some higher ed.
But then there’s a more foreboding possibility for Dems, that there’s a transformation underway in Ohio that is going to put the state ever further out of reach. To put it bluntly, that is going to make the state closer to IN and MO politically than MI, PA and WI.
There’s also a case to be made that Ohio was simply never as blue as Dems liked to imagine in the late aughts. Fact is, Obama’s margins in the state were a lot smaller than in MI and WI. And Ohio is more Southern-inflected than the Upper Midwest.
Another explanation is that the Ohio Dem party still hasn’t recovered from its upheaval of recent years. The Dems lost FIVE state legislative races by three points or less. Why didn’t they get more of the resources that went to the suburban Columbus races Dems won quite easily?
Or maybe it has to do with Kasich’s mildness. There was plenty to hit Ohio Republicans over, including cuts to local gov’t and a huge for-profit charter scandal. But Kasich didn’t spur a reaction like Walker or Brownback/Kobach.
Maybe Cordray was just a weak draw at the top of the ticket—a policy guy gone from the state a few years. But DeWine ain’t exactly Beto either. And Cordray’s Warren-ish issue profile is a decent fit for OH. And low-key-ness didn’t keep Evers from winning WI.
So what’s going on in Ohio? I’ve spent a lot of time reporting there in recent years but don’t have a firm answer. Here are some possible explanations. I’m curious what people make of them.
Obama won the state twice, albeit narrowly. And past big Dem years produced major gains in Ohio, like winning governor in 2006. This year, MI and WI saw big Dem successes, despite also contending with gerrymandering. Not Ohio.
But overall 2018 was brutal for OH Dems. They lost every other statewide race—guv, AG, etc. They didn’t pick up 1 US House seat—they hold 4/16. And they netted only four state reps and LOST a state sen seat in ex-Dem stronghold of Mahoning Valley, preserving GOP supermajorities.
Yes, Sherrod Brown won reelection, which shows the enduring appeal of his rumpled brand of economic populism. (Though his flawed opponent got almost 48% despite getting relatively little party/outside backing.)

@pareene Have said this many times since '16, will say it again. Dems don't need to reach all of "them." Only some. Obama swept the Midwest partly by losing rural counties by much less than Hillary did. Dems don't have to win these counties. They just can't get utterly destroyed in them.

"...idea being, if tariffs were announced, prices would rise, and all that cheap foreign metal would suddenly become more valuable.		And that’s what happened. When the tariffs went into effect, 2.2 million tons of foreign aluminum was sitting in warehouses in the US...."
Century's largest shareholder is the Swiss giant Glencore. And..."While Century was lobbying the Trump administration, Glencore, along with a handful of other commodity trading companies, was stockpiling record amounts of foreign aluminum in the U.S..."
Am late to the fascinating recent @BW piece on Trump's aluminum tariffs, but it deserves sharing. So, get this. In announcing the tariffs, Trump focused a lot on one small company, Century, which employs about 2,000 at three US smelters. What went unmentioned, though, is this:

"'We are an extremely wealthy community,' resident Vince Taylor, a former software-company owner, said, during an open forum at an association meeting in March 2017. 'We shouldn’t be acting like a poverty community.'"
"She says that retirees moving in—'post Google-ites' she calls them—are willing to pay for better amenities and that Oakmont’s future shouldn’t be dictated by the 'small minority' who aren’t willing. She suggested those pinched for money should look into a reverse mortgage."
"After retiring in 2015, Iris Harrell sold her...remodeling company she founded in Mountain View and says she is “never going to have to worry about money.” She and her wife, Ann Benson, sold their home in Silicon Valley for $3.8 million and bought a home in Oakmont for 800K."

"They are Clarence Thomas, who was confirmed in 1991 by 52 senators who won just 48 percent of the popular vote, and Samuel Alito, confirmed in 2006 by 58 senators who garnered, again, 48 percent of the vote."
"And consider this further point. Two more current members of the dominant conservative bloc, while nominated by presidents who did win the popular vote, were confirmed by senators who collectively won fewer popular votes than the senators who voted against them...."
"...justices who are part of a five-vote majority on the bench but who were nominated and confirmed  by a president and a Senate who represent the will of a minority of the American people."
"The answer is Neil Gorsuch....And if the Senate confirms Kavanaugh soon, the vote is likely to fall along similar lines, meaning that we will soon have two Supreme Court justices who deserve to be called “minority-majority”:..."
"In the entire history of the court, one justice has been	a) nominated by a president who didn’t win popular vote and	b) confirmed by a majority of senators who collectively won fewer votes in their last election than did senators who voted against that justice’s confirmation."
"The 54 senators who voted to elevate Gorsuch had received around 54 million votes, and the 45 senators who opposed him got more than 73 million. That’s 58 percent to 42 percent."		@michaeltomasky on what it means to have a minority-rule Supreme Court: https://t.co/b7cmGeaktv

There's also the "Columbia" entry on July 7, apparent reference to the country club where Blasey Ford was swimming that day before (and near) the party.
@_Bryan2017 @pbump Yup. But the Dems could've asked about it too!
@s_jacobNJ @pbump Blasey Ford said she remembered one other guy at the house besides Judge, PJ Smyth. Kavanaugh says there was no evening that summer that fit the description. But right there on his calendar is July 1 "skis" with Judge, PJ and others.
@NickRiccardi Truly. Inexplicable. I mean, it's right there, in the allegedly exculpatory calendar.

@nnmeli Definitely. But the story hasn't gotten the relentless, high-profile play it deserves, given the scale of the toll. That's why this piece was so helpful. (Also, FWIW, the reporter was born and raised in Mexico.)
Finally, I should've credited the reporter on this great and necessary piece at the outset: @davidluhnow.
"Mexico’s murder tally may be underreported because many victims are tossed into unmarked graves, burned or put through sugar-cane grinders....The sheer number of the missing could outnumber better-known cases of 'disappeared,' including Argentina’s Dirty War against leftists."
"Between 2000 and 2017, roughly 2.5 million people were murdered in Latin America and the Caribbean, as if Chicago were wiped out. That compares with 900K killed in the conflicts of Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan combined, according to U.N. figures and estimates by Iraq Body Count."
"At current murder rates, if you live in Acapulco (or Caracas, Venezuela, or San Salvador) for 70 years, there is a roughly 1-in-10 chance you will get murdered." !!!
"Latin America accounts for 43 of the 50 most murderous cities, including the entire top 10...South Africa and the U.S.—where St. Louis ranks No. 19—are the only countries outside Latin America that crack the top 50."
"....Two trailer trucks filled with more than 150 cadavers each were roaming Mexico’s second-largest city of Guadalajara for days because the morgue was too full. Officials admitted the trucks contained corpses after neighbors complained of the smell and dripping blood."
"At the Acapulco morgue, bodies pile up faster than workers can process them. ...356 bodies that remain unclaimed or unidentified were stuffed into five refrigeration units. The smell of death hung in the air."
"Last year, a record 63,808 people were murdered in Brazil. Mexico also set a record at 31,174, with murders so far this year up another 20%."
"With just 8% of the world’s population, Latin America accounts for roughly one third of global murders. Nearly one in every four murders around the world takes place in just four countries: Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico and Colombia."
Meanwhile, some craziness in another part of the world: the stats in this WSJ story late last week on the homicide surge in Latin America are insane. It's gotta be one of the most under-covered stories on the planet now, given the life-and-death stakes. https://t.co/itkE7dX6xK

@MickiMaynard @petesaunders3 @ProPublica @frontlinepbs ...the concentration of wealth and growth in just a handful of cities causes problems for them, too. Think of the housing costs and traffic in Ann Arbor, which wasn't really built for this scale. Everyone would be better off if Jackson, Saginaw and Flint were in better shape.
@MickiMaynard @petesaunders3 @ProPublica @frontlinepbs That's exactly the dynamic I was getting at in the piece with mention of regional winner cities like Columbus. But I'm not sure it's such a healthy dynamic. It causes great resentment in the left-behind cities as they see their best &amp; brightest go to Columbus and not return. And
@DavidBurhenn Exactly. As I note, there are winner-take-all cities within regions, too: Columbus in Ohio, Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor in Michigan...

@volumecontrol10 Good question and the answer is no. Dayton has wealthy suburbs (little wealth now resides in the city proper) but the disparities aren't on the scale of what you see in metro Baltimore.
@MickiMaynard @petesaunders3 @ProPublica @frontlinepbs True. So the question is, what do you do about all the small cities, as Columbus accumulates more and more of regional wealth &amp; dynamism? Not just Dayton, Toledo and Akron, but all the smaller ones: Mansfield, Lancaster, Zanesville, Springfield, Middletown, Chillicothe, Newark...

@MickiMaynard @ProPublica @frontlinepbs @Richard_Florida I think VERY proudly of Dayton. It's why I've been there 10 times in past couple years. The bar scene is amazing. But it's simply a fact--quantifiable in data, or visible to the naked eye--that Dayton and many others like it are being left behind by the hyper-prosperous cities.
@MickiMaynard @ProPublica @frontlinepbs And Dayton didn't used to be just 140,000. It was 262,000. That's part of the divide too, the different trajectories in population. Seattle's among the fastest growing cities in the country. Baltimore used to be 150K greater than DC, 40 yrs ago--it's now falling well behind it.
@MickiMaynard @ProPublica @frontlinepbs Sure, they're different scales. But as I note in the piece, despite that difference, all those cities used to be MUCH closer in wealth and income than they are today. (To put it another way: Ann Arbor's being a small city doesn't keep IT from being very wealthy.)
"A few decades ago, [Washington and Baltimore] were strikingly similar in scale, levels of wealth and urban challenges — in fact, Baltimore’s population was 150,000 larger than D.C.’s as recently as 1980. Today, to travel the 40 miles between the two cities is to risk vertigo."
"All those cities have since left Dayton in the dust. Seattle’s per capita income is now 48% greater. Boston’s edge has jumped all the way to 61% — a tenfold increase. And in the Bay Area, per capita income is 94 percent greater than in the Dayton area—that is, almost double."
"In 1980, even after the first wave of deindustrialization, Middle American cities such as Dayton were remarkably close to par with their coastal peers. Per capita income in the Seattle area was only 16% greater than in the Dayton area. In metro Boston, the edge was only 6%."
Our growing regional divides aren't just urban-rural. They're among cities, too, between a handful of winner-take-all cities and countless others, an imbalance that's taking a toll at both ends.	 	My @ProPublica piece expanding on tonight's @frontlinepbs: https://t.co/GBqyV1rlp4

"On their return to the plane, Magellan provides notebooks from each college so students can write down their thoughts. The company then binds their notes in a book at the end of the trip." Awww.....
Actually, $30K is just the low-end package. Magellan Jets' "college tour package offers 10 hours of flight time. The cost is $57,000, and Magellan works with Top Tier Admissions, a college advisory firm, which will provide an admissions expert for the trip at an additional fee."
"'The college application process is stressful,' he said, 'and we’re focused on helping them maximize their time and get from A to B as quickly as possible.'"
"En route, students will be given briefing books on each college, which include information like the name of the admissions representative covering their high school and tips on whom to meet and where to go on campus."
Oh, look: wealthy families can now take college tours by private jet, for a mere $30,000 each. Happy Labor Day! https://t.co/woIS5aZlcF

"The Internet can be used for progressive purposes, as when activists call for protest in Ukraine or Egypt or when teachers use social media to organize strikes. The crucial point: In such cases, people are using Internet against itself, to get their bodies into the real world."
"Traditional fascists wanted to conquer both territories &amp; selves; the Internet will settle for your soul. The racist oligarchies that are emerging behind the Internet want you on the couch, outraged or elated, it doesn’t matter which, so long as you're dissipated at end of day."
"The Internet has revived fascist habits of mind. Smartphones &amp; news feeds structure attention so that we can't think straight. Programmers deliberately appeal to psychological tactics to keep us online rather than thinking. Is pulling your phone out 80 times/day a free choice?"
"...The Internet breaks the line between the public and private by encouraging us to confuse our private desires with the actual state of affairs....We can now allow our browsers to lead us into a world where everything we would like to believe is true."
"Modern democracy relies upon the notion of a 'public space' where, even if we can no longer see all our fellow citizens and verify facts together, we have institutions such as science and journalism that can provide joint references for discussion and policy..."
"Common sense held that more connectivity would mean more freedom. But while Zuckerberg was calling connectivity a basic human right, more traditional rights were in decline as Internet advanced. Every year since '05 has seen retreat in democracy and advance of authoritarianism."

So I'm sure it's news to Warren, who back then was being decried by Third Way as too risky, that the candidate she was boosting in Ohio was a safe centrist who represents a path opposite to her own.

@jetpilotnelson Yeah, as he notes below, that was a typo. Northam was the centrist hero he meant to include from that race. (Never mind that Northam won partly because he was more LEFT than Perriello on choice.)
Or that, as far as I recall, literally nobody among the Democrats was objecting to the moderate Doug Jones as the best alternative to Roy Moore.
Not to mention that I'm pretty sure that something other than Pritzker's "centrism" won the Illinois primary for him.
It's highly, um, amusing to see Third Way, which five years ago was attacking Elizabeth Warren-style populism as too risky for the Dems in a WSJ op-ed, now embracing her ally Richard Cordray as one of their own to argue that centrism is carrying the day for the Democrats in 2018. https://t.co/9FXyROHl7C

"When white and higher-income families live in a 'diverse' or gentrifying   neighborhood, they're more likely to send their children to schools elsewhere. At some schools in Bed-Stuy, Harlem, Fort Greene and Crown Heights, &lt;25% of children actually attend their assigned school."

@IanKullgren @tadamcollins Yeah, it's definitely easier in some parts of the country than others, cost of living wise. But it's worth noting that many, many of the most under-covered areas are also among the most affordable to live in.
@BorderReporter My hunch is that the program directors will not look kindly on that when it comes to deciding which papers to deploy reporters at.
@amandakhurley @report4america Exactly. I've been fully aware that this wasn't the easy course to be sending people on. But hopefully it gets a little easier thanks to this program, if it can really scale up.
@Kenwardjr "It’s important to send out reporters to find out not only how people feel politically but to chronicle 'the actual lived experience of people'—to show how 'messed up people’s lives are' and to describe the underlying political and economic causes." More: https://t.co/wOg6qre0ao
@nhannahjones Yup. I've found that the strongest pushback to the advice tends to be not from the aspiring reporters but from those who came up via the cubicle route, who argue that the in-country route simply isn't feasible anymore. Point taken. But a program like this makes it more feasible.
@clanghoff1 Huh? Google and Facebook helped eviscerate local news reporting by soaking up nearly all digital ad revenue. The least they can do is to give back a bit by supporting an effort like this. And these reporters in all likelihood will not be covering the tech industry...
This is EXACTLY what I've been urging aspiring journalists to do for years now: try to get a job at a local or midsize-metro paper where you can do real reporting with impact--stories that wouldn't get covered if you weren't there--instead of getting caught in a cubicle in NY/DC.
"...and talking to residents who had been w/o water for days. Soon after his reporting, the person in charge of the water district retired &amp; the state found $3.4 million to fix the water system. “It’s so barren out there that just being on the ground can have  really big impact.”
"In parts of the country where newsrooms are filled with empty desks,  tracking down stories can be depressingly easy. Will Wright, a reporter who was placed at The Lexington Herald Leader, helped break a major story simply by attending a community meeting in eastern Kentucky..."
@eclisham Eh, I don't think getting a single new reporter (if they're lucky) counts as a "rescue."
@auberginefedora I really wouldn't be too worried about that. The people running this program are highly respected news veterans who wouldn't stand for that. Also, in all likelihood these reporters are going to be covering far more mundane, close-to-home issues.
“Maybe [young reporters these days] have done that Brooklyn thing, where you spend a year or two in a cubicle working for a blog. But that’s not the same as being on the ground doing the real work, knocking on a door and walking into someone’s kitchen.”
"While Google has committed money and training, Facebook has yet to sign  on. 'Mark Zuckerberg could solve the local news problem w/ the money that’s falling between his couch cushions. Folks like Facebook &amp; Google have the $ to solve this problem, and it is a solvable problem.'”
"In 1990, daily and weekly newspaper publishers employed about 455,000  people, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By January 2016,  that number had fallen to 173,000."

And 3) it’s going to send you in search of information elsewhere. One reason it was so easy to target many voters in these places with Facebook was that it really has become THE source for voters totally cut off from traditional news sources.
2) If you don't have local news, it’s going to affect your politics, whether and how you vote. It’s going to go make you feel more disconnected from any sort of community and civic fabric. It's going to make you feel isolated, and open to messages that prey on alienation.
because you have no idea who they are. They’re people from elsewhere with nice clothes and sharp-looking glasses.
to you means something totally foreign—it’s just Wolf and Anderson and the pundits and the guys who come to town with the candidate or president and are penned in the back of the room. So when the candidate or prez starts railing against the media, you turn and glare at them...
I've thought a lot about this and have a few theories for why it might be so: 1) It’s a lot easier to hate the media if you don’t know anyone in the media. If you don’t see hardworking reporters any more at your town hall or courthouse or high school football game, “the media”...

@RobClarick Keep in mind it's metro area, not just city proper. NY suburbs are very segregated, as Westchester's years-long fending off of desegregation efforts are a reminder...
@Nate_Cohn Very true. But this is where the other half of the picture comes in: Hillary's deep unpopularity in these areas, going back to her trouncing in '08 IA caucus and WI primary. Once again, too much 2016 analysis overlooks the other half of the ballot. It wasn't just about Trump.

Many are pointing out ample coverage of this strike in the past day or two. Why yes, which has been good to see. But this tweet was sent Thursday evening. By which point the strike was already a week old and there had been relatively little prominent national coverage. Carry on.
"The story of how the people of a sprawling region of our country — one of its most physically captivating &amp; ecologically bountiful — went from enjoying a modest but self-sufficient existence as small-scale agrarians to dreary dependency on coal barons or the alms of government."
A good time to revisit my recent review essay on "Ramp Hollow," a probing new book on the exploitation of West Virginia: https://t.co/FNkVfBkQhv
@agraybee Correction: by Thursday evening the strike was already a full week old.
@agraybee I sent that tweet Thursday evening. At which point the strike was four days old and very little had been written on it in prominent places. Has been good to see coverage catching up since then.

Blackstone CEO Schwarzman made at least $800 million last year. Good thing that the Trump tax law did not, despite Trump's earlier promises, close the notorious tax loophole that will allow Schwarzman (a Trump ally) to pay a low rate on most of that haul.  https://t.co/5UeSfOjHWJ
