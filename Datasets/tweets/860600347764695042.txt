@Lyle_Armstrong @Jim_Jordan Fair. I enjoyed the discussion. Thank you for  for being civil.
@Lyle_Armstrong @Jim_Jordan As a ‚ÄúLazy pseudo intellectual‚Äù I want you thank you for your service. Because of men and woman like you, I can freely express my thoughts in an open forum for debate. I‚Äôm asking earnestly, please provide me with the source. I cannot find it myself and would like to be informed.
@Lyle_Armstrong @Jim_Jordan You didn‚Äôt answer my question. Does 1 false statement in a list of false statements make all the statements false? Does the statement ‚Äúall of the statements in the dossier are true‚Äù being false mean ‚Äúall the statements in the dossier are not true‚Äù true? You‚Äôre proving a negative.
@Lyle_Armstrong @Jim_Jordan Isn‚Äôt your goal to inform others? Inform me. And it‚Äôs funny that you‚Äôre attacking me now and not my argument. Doesn‚Äôt that indicate something?
@Lyle_Armstrong @Jim_Jordan And now because one statement in the dossier is false, all the statements in the dossier are not true? I thought proving a negative wasn‚Äôt possible?
@Lyle_Armstrong @Jim_Jordan Source?
@Lyle_Armstrong @Jim_Jordan The point I‚Äôm trying to make is that you prove statement is false by using proof by contradiction. I‚Äôm not asking you to prove that it didn‚Äôt happen, I‚Äôm asking you to prove one of the statements is false.
@Lyle_Armstrong @Jim_Jordan If he isn‚Äôt dead, then I‚Äôm not a serial killer. Proven.
@Lyle_Armstrong @Jim_Jordan So he isn‚Äôt dead then?

@Lyle_Armstrong @Jim_Jordan Who did I kill, specifically?
@Lyle_Armstrong @Jim_Jordan Ex: This person was at this place at this time. False. This person was at a different place at that time.
@Lyle_Armstrong @Jim_Jordan You‚Äôre offering a general statement. The dossier does not offer general statements. It provides specific examples that were verified by multiple sources with specific times and specific events that occurred. All of which can be disproven by providing contradictory evidence.
@RandPaul You literally voted to increase this debt by $1.5 trillion.
@Lyle_Armstrong @Jim_Jordan You can offer any contradictory evidence on any of the statements in the dossier.

@JohnCornyn 1000000000% increase in children separated from their parents.
