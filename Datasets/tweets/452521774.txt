We should probably acknowledge more that the dominant "cities are great, everyone should move to cities" narrative dovetails nicely with corporations' interests in maximizing shareholder profits.

How academic publishing works: Authors don't get paid for their research. Reviewers don't get paid for peer review. Journal editors don't get paid to edit. The publishers take the final product and sell it back to the universities via multi-million dollar subscriptions.

@icmesccm The roaches are pretty chill and slow-moving! I usually just scoop a few up and let Holly eat them off my hand. Much easier than crickets, who hop all over the place like maniacs
Tried to watch one of the Transformers movies with the kids but the first hour of it was basically just Mark Wahlberg learning to be a better dad
Update: kids narced me out as soon as she got home. 		Charlie: Daddy got BIG roaches!		Jack: Yeah and they’re gonna make BABY roaches!		You should have seen her face.

Should point out these are a tropical species called dubia roaches. They need very warm temps to survive and especially breed, so the likelihood they'll escape and become a nuisance in a temperate climate is fairly low. https://t.co/4dhlwUURnv
@B_M_Finnigan Well shit, where am I supposed to store them?
Anyhow my wife’s away at a conference right now, doesn’t get back until tomorrow, I’m sure she’ll be fine with all this
The idea is they’ll start making babies and soon we won’t have to stop buying reinforcements for Holly’s supply, since she’s burning through roughly 100 of them a week now
They’re cool though, much less of an escape concern than with crickets. They basically just want to be left alone in a dark place and periodically have food delivered to them, which I find extremely relatable
They’re practically horses! It’s like I have a Tupperware full of livestock!

Addendum: since folks are asking, the primary way Amazon reduced its taxes last year was via the tax break for executive pay in the form of stocks. That shaved about $1 billion off its tax bill. Much of the rest is from R&amp;D credits and asset depreciation. https://t.co/RNI1GNfdkq
As you file your federal tax returns this year, stop to consider that you paid more federal taxes than one of the largest, wealthiest and most profitable companies in the world, and that this is not an accident. https://t.co/uBetm7QQGh
Had Amazon paid the full statutory rate they would have had a $2 billion tax bill. In a deficit spending environment like ours, the money that Amazon isn’t paying will eventually have to get paid by someone. https://t.co/uBetm7QQGh
It’s not just Amazon. Huge, profitable companies write their tax burdens down to 0 all the time thanks to the dizzying array of breaks and loopholes available to them in the tax code. https://t.co/uBetm7QQGh
The company’s effective federal tax rate was actually -1% — they received a rebate of over $100 million despite having no taxes to pay. By contrast, the poorest 20% of households pay an effective federal tax rate of about 1.5% https://t.co/uBetm7QQGh

@dancer_egg Same
He’s sheltered from the wind by the shed and some straw bales we set up outside, and being out all year he adapts and grows a thick winter coat in the fall. We wouldn’t take an indoor rabbit and set him out in the middle of the winter!
Eventually we realized he was digging himself a massive underground burrow. I went out there with a flashlight - couldn’t see to the bottom of it. He camps out in there when it’s real cold. But as long as it’s above -10 or so, he’s hopping about in his enclosure
For the “bring the bunny inside” folks - the summer before his first winter outside he started digging like a fiend as soon as the first hint of fall hit the air. We couldn’t tell what he was up to

What's the opportunity cost of that? And even worse, how many people just give up, decide they don't have the money for the treatment or the time it takes to figure out how to pay? It's maddening.
Multiple layers of red tape stand between my son and the treatment he needs. The way the system is set up, the onus is on us to figure out how to guide him through it. How many person hours each year, I wonder, are spent by patients navigating healthcare bureaucracies?
It's absolutely infuriating. We have to become experts in reams of bureaucratic arcana just to ensure that a medically necessary procedure for our son won't be financially ruinous. It's a huge waste of time for everybody involved.
She's been working on this for days. The hospital and the insurance company aren't used to dealing with each other in a situation like this, so they've essentially offloaded all the administrative work on to us. Medical codes. Institution ID codes. Exception codes. Waiver codes.
My wife is in the other room trying to set up a conference call between a hospital administrator and our insurance company so that the insurance company will recognize a doctor as in-network, saving us hundreds, perhaps thousands of dollars on a necessary procedure for our son.

Yes of course we told her, my recollection is that there was no real fallout? Like everyone had a good laugh, grandma didn't get sick or anything. It was just calcium or whatever. I think everyone was just relieved it wasn't like, a tapeworm or anything.
(when you do a good tweet) https://t.co/7qEsdVsiUc
Anyway that was the last time dad put bladder stones in a tupperware. And that was the last time any of us turned our backs on grandma.
Grandma, evidently, had very reasonably concluded that if it was in a tupperware on the kitchen table, it was intended for human consumption. Best we can figure, she thought they were some sort of designer mint/antacid combination, which would have explained their chalky taste.
Before mom can say anything Grandma goes, "What kind of mints are these?" and pops another one in her mouth.
Alarm bells don't go off until the second "crunch." Mom whips around. There's grandma with the tupperware of bladder stones in front of her. She had somehow idly unearthed it from the pile of stuff on the table. Grandma's hand is moving toward her mouth.
They were just kind of chatting, catching up, when all of a sudden mom hears a "crunch" from behind her. She thinks this is a little weird because she doesn't remember any crunchy food being left on the table.
That first night of her visit, after dinner, my mom was washing the dishes while grandma was sitting at the kitchen table behind her. Mom had her back toward grandma.
And after a few days the tupperware full of stones just kind of got buried under the general household cruft that would get left on the kitchen table -- mail and gloves and random stuff. And we basically forgot about them for a few weeks. 		And then, Grandma came to visit.
They were white and smooth, had no smell or anything like that. They were roughly the size of marbles, but pyramid shaped. Rounded corners. Very cool to look at, I showed them to my friends and we all ooh'ed and ahh'ed.
So he took the stones out and sewed the dog back up. The dog made a full recovery iirc. And then dad washed the stones and put them in a tupperware and brought them home to show me. I was like 10 I think?
One day dad opened up a giant Schnauzer and was shocked to find dozens of bladder stones shaped like tetraheda -- little interlocking pyramids. https://t.co/4OL68rj6dx
Bladder and kidney stones were the real show stoppers. They came in all sorts of shapes, sizes, colors, textures. Like ocean glass, but from the inside of a dog!
(my childhood was awesome)
Context: My dad is a veterinarian and mom's a vet tech. When I was a kid they would always bring home cool and weird stuff they pulled out of animals: worms, ticks, unspeakably large maggots, things of that nature.
Okay since this game sucks, I'm gonna share the story of the time my dad left a tupperware full of bladder stones on the kitchen table.

Key point on Warren wealth tax, from Zucman and Saez: under the tax the total annual tax burden (income + wealth) for the top 0.1% would rise from 3.2% of wealth to 4.3% of wealth. Among the bottom 99% the total tax burden relative to wealth is 7.2%. https://t.co/OYw9poa1ut https://t.co/BDDXRjYzjL
One thing to keep in mind too: there's plenty of research showing skyrocketing inequality will eventually be bad for the rich. https://t.co/XzEteDz3n4
Whether that trade-off is worth it is of course debatable. But you have to set that against the current reality for the middle class, which is stagnant wages, flat or declining wealth, and a diminished voice in the political process.
Nothing gets "wiped out." But the super-rich would realize a slightly smaller return to their capital. For the $100 million example it amounts to an 11% difference over 10 years. https://t.co/Pm63fm8nnj
Assuming a 5.5% annual return on the assets, after 10 years a $100 million fortune subject to the tax would be worth $152 million. Without the tax it would be worth $171 million. https://t.co/Pm63fm8nnj https://t.co/xEc68XG5RP

RT @allahpundit: Cannot believe the Dem bill got more votes than Trump’s bill in a Republican-held Senate. What a humiliation.
There's an extent to which this is true for income, but it's not for wealth. The net worth of the median American family today is slightly lower than it was in 1983, in inflation-adjusted terms. In absolute terms, you're getting a smaller slice of pie than you had 30 years ago. https://t.co/z0AT7iBjLY
One argument you often hear is that we shouldn't worry about inequality because overall standards of living have been rising for everyone -- sure you may have a smaller piece of the pie, relative to the rich, but it's still bigger than the piece you had 30 years ago.

Here's how it would affect a hypothetical person with a fortune of $100 million, assuming an annual 5.5% return on their wealth. With a 2% tax in place after 10 years their fortune would be worth $152 million, compared to $171 million without the tax. https://t.co/mSNH2RYAiz https://t.co/wLiAw42KrC
Because the rich use their wealth as a source of political power, it's also useful to think of the wealth tax as a tax on political power, shifting the power balance in the US away from billionaires and toward the less wealthy. https://t.co/mSNH2RYAiz
But liberal economists like Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez say the primary purpose of such a tax isn't to raise money, it's combat inequality. Today the top 1% own as much as the bottom 95% of families, a radical shift from several decades ago. https://t.co/mSNH2RYAiz https://t.co/iMjoQxBXKG

Cynics have long suspected that this is how Washington works. But this paper provides what is probably the most clear-cut, rigorous and quantitative data demonstrating that things work this way. https://t.co/EuGcElQvQ8
Net result: Charitable corporate donations "distort the outcome of the political process away from the public good and towards private interests," as the paper concludes. https://t.co/EuGcElQvQ8
Last major finding: Because non-profits are viewed as independent entities, regulators take their comments seriously. So when a non-profit leaves a comment in line with a funder's viewpoint, the final regulatory discussion tends to more closely align with the firm's views as well
The second major finding: Non-profits who commented on a rule that a funder also commented on *were significantly more likely* to adopt the funder's viewpoint than they would have been otherwise. https://t.co/EuGcElQvQ8
When these relationships surface, the non-profits involved say no, there's no WAY corporate donations influence our policy work at all. Inconceivable! However... https://t.co/EuGcElQvQ8 https://t.co/UfcgYEBpLT

It got ugly. I told her that if anything happened to that cricket, she'd find the roaches in the bed. Oddly enough this did not de-escalate things

@ColtonlGrace The Siena poll frames it as a Cuomo priority, which activates partisan attitudes from the get-go. The questions are in no way comparable.
@tomangell This makes no sense to me. And yet it's preferable to the status quo! Just an indication of how bad the status quo really is.
The money opposed to legalization is going to people and groups rooted in an 80s/90s mindset, which has really been a gift for legalization: compared to that, commercial legalization is completely reasonable.
The problem for opponents of marijuana commercialization: there is no institutional voice making a sensible, evidence-based case for the workable alternatives.
Two polls conducted a year apart with completely different question wordings show slightly different levels of support for legalization in New York (62% vs 56%) and this is how the nation's leading anti-legalization group tries to frame it. https://t.co/dCK95uLiLJ

But make no mistake: under decriminalization marijuana use *remains illegal.* And that's a huge problem if you're trying to stop the criminal justice system from ruining lives over a plant.
Vermont's policy's not perfect either. There's no tax revenue, and it still leaves room for a black market for people who don't want to grow their own. Will take another couple years to see how that all sorts itself out
The true middle ground on marijuana policy looks more like what Vermont has -- use and possession are legal. Cops can't bust down your door because a neighbor saw a plant. But there's no commercial market. No ads, no profit margins, no Altria.
And even for just simple possession of below-threshold amounts, punishments tend to escalate for multiple infractions.
If an officer sees or suspects use of any kind, that's often used as a probable cause to set off a whole chain of events that end at a citation if you're lucky, but also can escalate to detention, arrest, asset seizure, etc etc.
Marijuana legalization opponents often seek to cast "decriminalization" as a sensible middle-ground alternative. But decrim still has huge problems, the biggest of which is that use and possession remain under the purview of the criminal justice system.

@KeithNHumphreys That's my whole business model: reel em in with a lighthearted story about crickets, then sit them down and lecture them about wealth inequality for all of 2019
@markaprovost Agreed.
Think of it this way: decades of lax antitrust enforcement have amounted to a deliberate decision to take money from the poor and middle class and give it to the rich. https://t.co/HHaHUgxqnh
The researchers found that companies' ability to set higher prices because of their growing market power effectively transferred 3 percentage points of national income from the poor and middle class to the top 20% in 2016. https://t.co/HHaHUgxqnh
But new research on the effects of monopoly pricing on inequality is a pretty strong refutation of that line of thinking. https://t.co/HHaHUgxqnh
There's a line of economic thought that says what's good for the stock market is good for the middle class, because so many middle class families have a 401k now. We all have a stake in capital, the thinking goes.

To say nothing of the implications for policymaking and how we tax the rich and poor.
The flipside of this logic is that if you're struggling financially, it's just because you're making bad choices. All of this contributes to the average American's profound misunderstanding of wealth and social mobility in this country.
It's awesome this dude left millions to charity. But how we tell these stories is important: when you omit the "inherited millions" part, you imply that the only difference between this guy and you or I is the personal choice he made to live frugally. It's not.

I'm pleased to report that I'm still alive, and that my marriage is still intact! You all had so much fun with this that my editor made me turn it into a story, which I present to you here, as a sort of director's cut of this thread. https://t.co/oXuG9Tj4yy
Good afternoon everyone.
@maxjrosenthal @swodinsky @GenePark I will not be livestreaming the dissolution of my marriage, you monsters
I make this information public because if I do not send any tweets tomorrow, it is because my wife murdered me after finding a cricket in our bed in the middle of the night.		And that's the news from Red Lake Falls.
I tried to collect all of them. It was like the world's shittiest game of Pokemon. But here we are, roughly 10 hours after the initial catastrophe, and stray crickets are still turning up in odd places.
Of course by this point many had migrated elsewhere. They were in the closet. In the shoes. Making their way downstairs to the playroom. The cats were having what I can only imagine was the greatest day of their lives.
Apparently I had not sealed the box shut as well as I should have. I ended up rushing out to the shed, in the 18" of snow and below zero temperatures, to pick up a spare aquarium we had. I spent about 45 minutes collecting crickets from the bathroom.
For some reason my first instinct is to flush the toilet, as if that will do anything to solve the problem of crickets in all the other places that were not the toilet. I shut the door. "Uh, don't come in here!" I try to sound cheerful.
Crickets on the floor. Crickets on the walls. Crickets in the sink. Crickets in the toilet.
I say "That's a good question. Let me check something." I walk over to the bathroom. I open the door. There are crickets. Everywhere.
I'm trying to wrap up a story but I keep hearing cricket-related exclamations coming from the kitchen. Eventually I get up to investigate. I say, "So uh the crickets got here toda--"	"I REALIZE THAT," she says. "WHY ARE THEY ALL OVER THE KITCHEN"
With the benefit of hindsight, this was a mistake.
And at first I was like "okay, maybe one or two got out when I initially opened the box. No biggie." I kept working.
About 20 minutes later I'm back at work on my computer, and I hear my wife in the kitchen: "where are these goddamn crickets coming from." I freely admit I had not kept her fully up-to-date on my cricket purchasing plans.
And then I put the box in the upstairs bathroom, the only semi-contained place in the house where I knew the kids and the cats and the dogs wouldn't be able to get at the box and tear it open and unleash 250 hungry crickets into our warm, semi-humid environment.
They were in a cardboard box. And I cut the tape and opened the box and SURPRISE! Crickets everywhere. It was the middle of the workday and I didn't have time to deal with cricket logistics, so I put the tape back on the box.
So, a shipment of crickets for the lizard arrived via FedEx today. It was my first time ordering bulk crickets off the internet, and I naively assumed that they would be in like, a bag or some other contraption to facilitate easy transfer to another container. They were not.

@pbump So when I was growing up we had a wood fireplace, and we had a woodbox connected to the outside of the house. When we got a new load of wood I would have to help my dad fill the woodbox and stack the remainder neatly outside. There's a certain method you have to follow (1/87)
@pbump would you also like to learn about stacking wood?
@pbump So I worked on a farm for two summers in college, and one of the things we had to do was lay aluminum irrigation pipe in the fields that needed it. So we'd walk around making pipe-layin' jokes all day.
The only explanation I have for this is that they're using "building wall" in the same sense as say, "laying pipe" or "stacking wood." Although I've never seen "wall" used in that context before.

Senate changes would slow the minimum wage increase to $12 an hour by 2030 at the earliest, rather than 2022 as the initiative called for. Also caps min wage for tipped restaurant workers at $4 an hour instead of $12.
Had the citizen-initiated measures passed via ballot, they would have required 3/4ths majorities to overturn. Adopting them legislatively sidestepped that requirement. The move was done at the urging of business groups.
@Shari_Klein haha I know that was my first reaction

Via the @ajc, here's a photo of a Gwinnett absentee ballot. Note that voters are asked to put their year of birth directly above the signature line. https://t.co/EA2MVDs2bl
Here's a peek at the data file. There were 161 of these -- ballots rejected for putting the current year as the year of birth. Every single one of them was from Gwinnett County. https://t.co/QgsU05vEqN https://t.co/8jBQsuElNX
Note that none of this is likely to make much difference to the Governor's race, where Abrams is below the recount threshold by 18,000 votes. But could be highly consequential for #GA07, where the current margin is just a few hundred votes. https://t.co/nvWpYmxTFw
Here are rejections broken down by reason. Note how much Gwinnett stands out for problems with birth dates. Part of the reason: in Gwinnett the ballots put the birth date line next to the signature line. Hundred of voters thought they were supposed to enter the current date. https://t.co/zSnu2NfMNR
Why the discrepancy? It's simple: county elections officials have tremendous leeway in deciding which ballots to toss. Gwinnett rejected ballots for birth date errors and address errors, and was aggressive when it came to signature mismatches. Fulton County was not. https://t.co/4Kz8d36OR6
@graykimbrough https://t.co/gKLhECv8XN
You see that blank swath around Atlanta, indicating no rejections? That's Fulton County. They received close to the same number of absentee ballots (17,000) as nearby Gwinnett County (20,000). Gwinnett rejected over 1,500 ballots. Fulton rejected 1. https://t.co/TKo62O9Ozd

But there remain areas of concern. States like Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina and Virginia don't have early voting or no-excuse absentee voting, for instance. So polling place closures in those states are more likely to be disruptive. https://t.co/vqPFOC7IBE

As I understand it, this model assumes that there is no level of marijuana use, even casual use, that does *not* require intervention by the state.
"Those who are diagnosed with a substance use disorder can be diverted into a treatment track where they receive appropriate level of care, those who are not problem users can be directed to social services for follow-up and addressing other life factors contributing to drug use"
Smart Approaches to Marijuana, nation's leading anti-legalization group, releases model legislation that would "require mandatory assessment of problem drug use by a treatment professional after the first citation" for marijuana use. https://t.co/2mUyM3fWs8

I've seen a lot of stories about Lyft offering to provide rides to Dodge voters at reduced cost, but none about these free rides, which seems... odd
@graykimbrough idk. they say there's construction around the old place? Not sure why they can't just have multiple locations at say, schools and churches, like every other town
