@JosephNSanberg Trump’s EPA gave Flint &amp;100 m to fix the mess... then with the money from taxes from the citizens of Flint it should’ve really helped. Yet that’s not known is it? It’s like Dems use it to blame Trump even tho Flint is run by Democrats.

@BofA_Help *face palm* I have a debit and credit card.
I’m thinking about moving my banking activities to @BofA_Help ... My company uses them so maybe I’d get paid faster and the careless ATM is amazing. So cool
@Oldbagnewyork @realDonaldTrump Said the lady with the mature username “I like squids” ... I expect that on the profile of a 14 year old. Maybe 14. More like 12.

@BofA_Help I’d love to sign up for that because it’s a great idea. I’m constantly leaving my wallet locked up at home and I use Apple Pay all the time. Could I move my existing credit card over, or something? I just started building credit and I don’t want to close an account this early in
@BofA_Help I am not a member but I have a question. I saw that you have new RFID ATMs that you can access with your phone. Do I have to be a member for that?
@AskCapitalOne I tried on the app. No luck
@CapitalOne I have been calling you guys for the past three days. Unfortunately when I have the time it’s later in the evening. I lost my debit card and I need a replacement. I have locked the card in question.

@ReePretty_Paid @MarilynKayStew1 If you have an issue with the wonderful persons posting about her holy Christian beliefs, get off this post. She has a right to believe what she wants without being attacked or belittled because of it. Shame on you people. Religion goes to the very core of being human.

By the way, @fbi who can’t figure out motive of Vegas shooter... find out. There are millions of country music fans all over the world who want to know what happened &amp; why. If you can’t find that out then there’s more proof the FBI needs to be disbanded.
FBI: Still don’t know Vegas shooters motive. • Holy hell if the FBI spent as much time clearing Hillary Clinton of wrong-doing &amp; as much time as they spent arresting Mr. Stone maybe they could figure it out. You know, maybe there was no reason. Maybe he was just a crazy.

@Liberalnewspre2 @Wozniak1 @gatewaypundit @AOC High taxes and government control aren’t that. Low taxes, so people can keep more money to spend in the economy and not be told how to spend their money. Do you like people telling you how to spend your money?
@pr0udwhite HELL YA! I love your Twitter! Thanks for the follow!
@Liberalnewspre2 @Wozniak1 @gatewaypundit It’s time to take your #RedPill
@Liberalnewspre2 @Wozniak1 @gatewaypundit Open your eyes “keyboard warrior” - the Dems aren’t for you. They aren’t for a free and prosperous America. They (people like AOC) want to turn our country into Denmark or Venezuela. We aren’t Denmark. We aren’t Venezuela. We are the USA, &amp; I’m proud of that. You should be too!

@Liberalnewspre2 @Wozniak1 @gatewaypundit Um. He used the biggest non nuclear device we have on ISIS. His generals have won battle after battle. Do I have to mention peace with NK and bringing the remains of Korean War soldiers home? Did Obama do that? No he didn’t build that and he didn’t do that. Obama just lied

@realDonaldTrump @jaggers_p You’re amazing.
There’s a liberal on here who says conservatives don’t have guts. That we elected a whiny draft dodger. How many of you don’t have guts? Just, show of likes- how many of you hunt or have been in the military in any form? Conservatives only.
@Liberalnewspre2 @Wozniak1 @gatewaypundit That “whiny draft dodger” did more than than Obama did in eight years in the first year. I’d go into details but this is Twitter so the space is min. Go find a liberal protestor. Then go find a Trump good ol’ boy at a bar in Texas. Now respectfully, I thank you for your thoughts
@ChuckCallesto This has been happening for a while, and it’s not a big deal. It’s about three seconds. Stop making it into a big controversy. It’s really not.

@NascarChuck336 @naz13146 @algore would you like to make any comments about this tweet?
@Carolly13248534 @marklutchman @POTUS I’m 28. Mark Lutchman is 24. We are both young so give us a break. I was agreeing with you that they are dirty, actually filthy. Some people couldn’t see that because the Dems hide that by changing the narrative. That’s why the tear down statues and change history books.

@Carolly13248534 @marklutchman Not true DeploraRedPill. Yes, we knew they were dirty, but not how dirty they really are. @POTUS in one way or another helped expose things like fraud, sexual favors for positions of power, a hush fund to pay off sexual abuse victims &amp; more. Dems aren’t dirty. They’re filthy.

There’s no politics in this. Don’t be fooled. All Dems were butthurt when Trump won. For them, this is about revenge, pure and simple.

@TXFrogMomma @zeusFanHouse @cheristired An abuse of power... the whole case should be tossed. It’s too open and in public view. Inappropriate.
@zeusFanHouse @VirginiaLRoss5 At six am while it was still dark out with @cnn cameras outside. This was an abuse of power and because it was so openly filmed and out into the public, the case should be thrown out.

#TrumpDidNotCave so shut up! The government is only open for three weeks! That’s not a win for Dems!
@JoeDelmonaco @DineshDSouza I started talking about NYC because that’s where you’re from. But you know that, you’re just trying to be difficult. Do make comments about New York? No, so stop talking about Texas like you know about it. The truth is Texas is thousands of miles from you &amp; your Manhattan home.

@JoeDelmonaco @DineshDSouza That has absolutely nothing to do with voter fraud in Texas, my home state. Plus Rosie has done the same thing and she didn’t get in trouble at all. Why? Because she’s a liberal, and it had to do with Hillary Clinton. Mrs Teflon I call her. Her and all of her friends!

@Stella_Basham1 @Bunnyboo_221 Opening the government for three weeks isn’t a cave. It’s people being able to get paychecks, work and prepare for when the government shuts down again (because after three weeks it will)
@SteveTrubilla @saveusrepublic2 @realDonaldTrump It’s only for three weeks anyway... which is enough for workers to collect pay and enough time for taxes. He didn’t cave. He was compassionate for our federal workers and those expecting refunds.
What happened with Stone today was something you’d expect in Russia or Nazi Germany... not the United States of America... &amp; then to have cameras there? This was planned with the mainstream media, no doubt.

Sour Don Lemon is a douchebag, a rotten piece of fruit in the summer sun stinking of mold and decomposition.
Last year we had 6 people on the terror watch list go through the border. One is too many. We have to crack down on our laws and whatever we can do to make our communities safer.
If some guys tried to break into your home, wouldn’t you say “shit! This is an emergency!” And do what you can to stop it? Same with our southern border. We have people who are coming in who we don’t know who they are. It’s a national emergency 🚨

@SarahBHoll I’ll break this down for u: When a person commits a crime they become a criminal, for example... if you were to steal my phone &amp; were caught you’d be charged with a crime. When a person crosses @ a point where they shouldn’t, that’s illegal, therefore they are illegal immigrants.
Which is more immoral to you? A wall keeping our people safe from murders, rapists, thieves, human traffickers and terrorists (6 people on the watch list crossed according to the CBP) or letting these criminals kill and hurt our fellow citizens?
@Comey You’re no FDR.
I disagree. A wall keeping out violent offenders will help substantially. When murders, rapists, kidnappers, &amp; human traffickers are barred from our streets our nation benefits. People who come into this country illegally do it because they have something to hide. https://t.co/FvPMyQITgW

No you’re going to deal with the people trying to break in your house first! Same thing with global warming. We have time to look, study and know what to do as we build the wall. I don’t believe in global warming but that’s what makes sense! It’s a compromise!

@littlehouser101 @charliekirk11 It would take 2 years to build the wall. In the mean time we could plan on how to curb our emissions since the hoax of global warming means so much.

@tonguepiercer @TheBadDadder @Lisette_72 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer She is one rich bitch for someone making less than $150,000 a year... (which is still a lot but that house? No) Hmm. Why is that Nancy? What deals with the devil have you made? Someone needs to look into where these politicians get so much money. It smells rotten.
@TheBadDadder @RealTT2020 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer Pelosi doesn’t have a filter. She just says things without thinking, obviously.
You know these Demonrats who launch these big political investigations surely have skeletons in their closet too. It’s about finding them. Example: Mueller was in charge of the 2001 anthrax poisoning. A innocent man was sent to jail where he died. No punishment for Mueller.

The media is complicit in the action of taking video of Trump supporters being attacked. Yes it is horrible. Yes the videos are terrible &amp; graphic. I know the dilemma is posting these so people can see how we are treated and then posting these, almost glorifying the actions.
@TrumpHotels @SueJRN @TrumpChicago That Trump! He’s such a jerk letting his employees do this! Look how miserable they were! And the children! My god Trump is brainwashing our children with sweets! Hahaha. But all seriousness. That’s awesome. I like the Q stocking

@marklevinshow @NancyPelosi, if you want to compare actual things done between Trump &amp; Obama &amp; which makes one more manly, I’d be happy too. Obama wussed out on the “red line”... Trump enforced it. Obama cut military spending. Trump boosted it. Obama pussied out of everything. He’s a coward.
