@MattThomasNYC The question was not abt his past - was about his messaging in 2016, and forming a platform spoke to multiple themes at ONCE. Bragging on Bernie and race for actions from the 80s is not much diff't than GOP bragging abt being the party that freed the slaves. Like, it's about NOW.

@aldusIvan Whatever man. Have a great day!
@aldusIvan Thanks!
@OllieBucolo I’m not talking about trolls or bots. I’m talking about interaction with real live campaign staffers
Oh one more thing: recent allegations of sexual harassment and mistreatment of women on the Bernie trail? Never saw it directly, but from the first day I got on the Bernie bus, the bro vibe was real and constant. So there’s that.
@Quigs8816 @SenSanders Yes. See thread
Thanks for coming to my BernTalk
So, three things I’ll be watching as his run begins:	1. How will @SenSanders handle running for the Dem nomination — in a party that has co-opted a bunch of his views—even as he still isn’t a Dem?	2. Can he be more than a single issue candidate?	3. WILL HE GET IT RIGHT ON RACE???
Even close friends of Bernie admit, he’s been almost laser-focused on economic inequality above all else, for his entire career. 		"His central concerns have never been war or civil rights or gay rights or women's rights."		https://t.co/YzzUwsintK https://t.co/6PzyDGEBvu
You’ll recall the time he caught a lot of heat when, after a terror attack, his team actually told reporters to NOT ask him about ISIS		https://t.co/P8nrvrwFaz https://t.co/6kSCl473zf
But perhaps the one thing I am waiting to see play out is how @SenSanders deals with what may have been his biggest vulnerability in 2016: the idea that he was a single-issue candidate.
A thing we still have to get right is how we cover these voters, and differences in black voters specifically, on issues of POLICING, and how that’s affected by AGE. My story:	https://t.co/a05YskdxXm https://t.co/uICkrbiSZp
Throughout the race, I CONSTANTLY found young voters of color who weren’t sold on Hillary. (Note: they’re still here)	https://t.co/5nparV2q0L
ANOTHER THING: the narrative on Bernie and race; y’all got it wrong. He did better with Black and Brown voters than you think, especially with YOUNGER black and brown voters. 	https://t.co/pD3dDIPu0K https://t.co/B70rlLjoaO
So many of his supporters never came around to the process that led to his loss. Those wounds still sting for many in Bernie’s camp
I remember talking All the time with NEW democratic voters he brought into the fold. This was maybe good for Democracy, but weird for the DNC? I’ll never forget the Bernie supporter who didn’t know how superdelegates work, on the floor of the DNC	https://t.co/zbKV4eOyBf https://t.co/JkTY99KfZ6
The 1 thing 2 have 2 know about Bernie, or remember about Bernie, is that he is not a Democrat. He wasn't in 2016. He is not running as one now. This tension animated the Democratic primary until THE very end. Remember the walkout? (My story: https://t.co/HmFavWgVID

One of the best ways we can honor those lost over the last year to gun violence would be to educate ourselves on the realities of guns in America today. I’d urge my journo colleagues to particularly diligent on this front.
Another said the way mass shootings are covered in America has "fundamentally distorted our perception of reality.”
An expert told me of all this: "If the coverage [of gun violence] is overwhelmingly driven by very high profile but fundamentally fairly rare issues what people, voters, policymakers are learning about and having a sense of as the norm is only those very isolated incidences.”
As heartbreaking as the tragedy in Parkland is, it’s a reminder that we care more about some types of gun violence than we do about other types of gun violence. I wrote a story about this, and made it an episode of my podcast as well	https://t.co/20AoQQXu0q
The vast majority of gun deaths in America — more than two-thirds — are suicides. The things we define as “mass shootings” usually comprise about one or two percent of all gun deaths annually. AND, the most used firearm in all gun deaths? HANDGUNS	https://t.co/zzPo1cCJfN
A reminder as we honor those lost in #Parkland: just about everything media coverage makes us think about gun violence in America is... well, off.

The speed at which a large chunk of my industry was like, “Well this one is done!” with a still developing story with many, many moving parts cuz a nice lawyer from the burbs said so is some Greenbook-level sloppy journalism. Y’all wanna cover this story, cover it till the end.
It tastes like like a seasoning rub for a turkey or something and I hate it. Stop trying to make nasty stuff cool!
Just got a celery juice drink — BY MISTAKE — and really I don’t understand y’all at all.
The mental gymnastics of saying “Well that one video doesn’t show everything” while also saying, “Well that one lawyer’s statement says everything you need to know” is really quite a lot.

@aijwilljo Trust me. You do.
All the concerned white people #onhere tweeting about how bad that MAGA kid video made you feel — it means nothing if you aren’t actively working to change the same behavior you see in your friends, your family, your coworkers and their kids regularly. Go talk to them. In person.
I take that phrasing back. We often don’t make any distinction between white boys and white men behaving badly.
Sometimes nothing reminds me that I am a Black man in America as much as seeing how white men and boys behaving badly are treated by our society.
Thinking a lot about Trayvon today and the courtesy never extended to him that many wish to extend to MAGA hat kid now.

@BeverlyNBCLA @NPR 🙌🏾🙌🏾
The ratings for “WHO WANTS TO HOST THE OSCARS?!” feel higher than the ratings for the actual Oscars.
@LouiseSchiavone Agreed but not all! Not even most!
5/ I have no smart way to end this thread other than to say I want my employer to do better.
4/ Temp culture also keeps entry-level @npr jobs from being filled by non-traditional entry-level journalists, like parents, or older employees, or people switching fields entirely. Those perspectives would make our coverage smarter. Temp culture keeps them away.
3/ I have seen @NPR try earnestly to look at the way it handles issues of race and diversity in its news coverage. And I applaud management for doing so. But my employer still fails to address some of the systemic issues, like temping, that continue to hurt the org’s diversity.
2/ I can’t tell you the number of qualified, intelligent, talented journalists I’ve seen leave NPR because they couldn’t afford temp life. Many of these journalists are women and people of color. @npr is worse off without them.
1/ 8 yrs ago, after completing a yr-long entry-level fellowship @NPR, I was offered a temp position to stay on. I reminded myself that my rent &amp; student loan payments didn’t temp &amp; then I quit. I came back in a full-time role after a year working elsewhere https://t.co/uosnNOBkCL

Alright this cross-country flight is about to take off. If these tweets throw me into a scandal before I land, just know I’m really, really happy that happened.
@JuliaHass Axios locked me in a locker one time in high school. And then he wanted my vote when he ran for student body president.
His Tinder profile photo his him surrounded by a bunch of brown kids. From that time he was abroad.
He thinks you’re hot, for a black/mixed/Asian/Latina chick.
He wears boat shoes and jorts. In February. On his boat.
He used to like Beyoncé, before she injected politics into the Super Bowl.
His parents gave him the down payment for his house, but he still shares those articles blaming millennials’ love of avo toast for their perpetual renter-ship
He hates the phrase “access journalism.”
He REALLY loves the White House Correspondents Dinner, before everyone confusingly decided to hate it.
He’s ok if the source reads the story before its published. They’re friends! And maybe even the pick the questions every now and then. Fine with it!
He doesn’t see color. Like, at all.
His dad helped him get this job. And maybe the last one, too.
There’s probably an old video of him from undergrad doing something racially insensitive.
He’d have gone to prep school. I believe that to my core. And he’d DEF be a he.
If @axios were an actual person. GO.

@pieteradejong I don’t think audio engineering should be automated. It’s an art!
@instamaia I don’t handle leveling for my show, producers and engineers do. But I am sure they have thoughts they can share. I’ll inquire!
We are too many years deep in this whole podcast game to have major players in the biz putting out product  that sounds like it’s allergic to audio engineers. Do. Better.
If I have to work the volume dial like a DJ in Ibiza just to hear all the words and sounds in your podcast at a reasonable volume, I WILL NEVER FINISH THE EPISODE
I completed a 20-hour roadtrip this weekend and I really just have one thing to say: PEOPLE MAKING PODCASTS STOP BEING LAZY WITH YOUR LEVELS. LEVEL OUT YOUR LEVELS SO I CAN ENJOY THE PRODUCT. PLEASE.

@EmGusk And I am glad you did!
Every generation finds a reason to distrust/be jealous of/hate on the generation coming up after them. FINE. But it’s not journalism. It’s bar talk, at best.
This rant isn’t a response to one particular Millennials hot take, but to a LITANY I’ve seen and silently stewed over for a few days now. DO BETTER
If your piece on focuses more on the stereotypes your colleagues’ (priveleged) kid seems to embody instead of the socioeconomic factors that have dictated the trajectory of an entire generation before they even knew what to watch out for, you’re lazy, and I don’t want to read it.
Just knuck up and write a piece saying you think youth is wasted on the young. Of course, that would just prove you’re saying something everyone has been saying forever and your hot take is actually trash
Good morning! Don’t forget that the oldest Millennials are 38 at this point, so that snarky think piece you just wrote/read/shared is probably all wrong and just full of someone who hates the attributes of youth that have been a constant kind of since forever.

There is an old Donald Trump tweet for EVERY occasion https://t.co/1yNkZNJlh2

@patrickcfenn1 @nprmusic @NPR @Drake I realize now you meant “it’s not news that Drake does this kind of thing,” not, “please Npr don’t cover this stuff, it’s not news.” My bad 😔 https://t.co/TnBSaKtGb6
@erbh1208 I did! Summer of 2013. Wonderful place
I buried the lead, here. I’m in DC right now.
You call it brunch, I call it “Oh my god literally every table in this restaurant is talking about Donald Trump.”

@blackntosh @jejohnson322 @NPRItsBeenAMin @1a We tape our show at the same time!!!!!!!!
Why call this particular special “The Trump Show” when every minute of every hour of every day of this network is literally just that? https://t.co/YnPXConQjY
RT @ayesharascoe: This was so much fun, and not just the wine! Thanks @NPRItsBeenAMin @samsanders for having me on! https://t.co/xSaZa8KHc0

@manminx @today_explained I think you’re looking for @rameswaram. I host @NPRItsBeenAMin. Thanks for listening to him, and hopefully to me as well!
I interviewed GOO Congressman Will Hurd @HurdOnTheHill at the beginning of the year. He told me he’d be vigilant in critiquing @realDonaldTrump when he needed to. His new op-ed in the @nytimes proves he meant what he said. 		Our full convo here: https://t.co/WYvnFvY2pr https://t.co/undZgvfUqi
I have spent most of my work week talking about, writing about, or prepping for conversations concerning either Vladimir Putin or Drake. I have a strange job.
