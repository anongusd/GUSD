@Neoavatara @DavidAFrench ...prayers is met with outrage. We‚Äôre not helpless but those up top Arnt doing anything. The term feels devoid of sympathy, like washing hands of the situation. The human bond no longer comes from those words b/c without any action they ring emotionless and hollow...

@BradMossEsq Did you read it? The complaint reads as an angry letter that just happens to be written by lawyers angry at and accusing WaPo of having an anti-conservative agenda, a bias against trump, and overall being ‚Äúfake news‚Äù. There‚Äôs barely any focus on the kid.
@_Drew_McCoy_ Also his constant insults toward the Dem base, history of putting his foot in his mouth, and he is an AWFUL debater‚Äînever clearly articulates his points or policies and his arguments jump all over the place. Rewatch the CNN Cruz/Bern debates and you‚Äôll see he‚Äôs a shitshow
@kthalps @disruptionary So do non-Berners from the Bernie bros. Anytime something negative is said about Bernie, especially on twitter, the bros pile on the speaker with combative aggression, often filled with every insult imaginable, but certainly chocked full of accusations
@jerweber They managed to do none of that. Most of the statements they quote to make these claims against WaPo are the WaPo directly quote the Native American man, not assertions the reporter or paper made on their own.
@jerweber Read the written complaint. It‚Äôs absolutely fucking bananas. The strategy they went with is wild: Very little focus on the actual kid and the ‚Äúdamages‚Äù done, and a whole lot accusing WaPo of anti-trump bias and fake news. Here‚Äôs two of the MANY complaints I chose randomly https://t.co/MUnPICJGGY
@Mr_JamesLandis @KT_So_It_Goes @Popehat As I tweeted somewhere earlier:	https://t.co/DJiIJhPePe
@jason_howerton @washingtonpost That is the most bonkers, unfocused complaint I‚Äôve ever read. They‚Äôre all over place with unproven or inaccurate accusations that arnt even about Sandmann, some arnt even related to the incident
@WilliamAin @MollyJongFast Ohhhh lol. I did the highlighting to show the contradiction, not sure why I did two colors. I think maybe because I thought the part in green was beyond hysterical
@Mr_JamesLandis @KT_So_It_Goes @Popehat I‚Äôd say perhaps if they cut out 75%-80% of what they said and strictly focused on the single kid, yes. Obviously they didn‚Äôt and because of that the complaint is a fucking mess of insults, conspiracies, inaccurate info, bias, and a whole lot more. It‚Äôs a dumpster fire
@KT_So_It_Goes Just two of the many hilarious claims that all boil down to ‚Äúwe lawyers are mad &amp; think the Post is fake news with an anti-trump agenda!‚Äù	The entire complaint revolves around Trump and accusing the WaPo of political bias. What an idiotic shitshow https://t.co/xGB7CU5r8b
@RobProvince Cool glue gun!
@smarkofthebeast @DeplorableTLB @iowahawkblog @BridgetPhetasy It‚Äôs not exactly what I originally thought, but it still definitely doesn‚Äôt change what I said about it. I just didn‚Äôt have the full picture
@WilliamAin @MollyJongFast Wha?

@SethAMandel You‚Äôre missing that it proves Pence was not in the know.

@rulege @MattWalshBlog Yes, but many are disingenuous assholes wanting and striving to be like their favorite alt-right ‚Äúprovocateur‚Äù idols
@Peter_Wehner I was told it was to keep out MS-13, drugs, and traffickers. Seems stupid if we‚Äôre keeping good, honest hardworking people from coming in.
@Peter_Wehner Wait, we‚Äôre building a wall to keep out ‚Äúillegal workers‚Äù?		Why do we want to keep out all these people willing to come over and work their butts off?

@UnifiedChris @djrothkopf It‚Äôs impossible to ignore that giant melon

@JessicaHuseman I‚Äôve seen others, but those people weren‚Äôt quiet about it. I mean they were on the street screaming at people about how they support trump and how all you liberals are intolerant bigots against free speech. As always, the people of NYC walked by ignoring them.

@smarkofthebeast @iowahawkblog @BridgetPhetasy Your meme game is strong sir knight
@smarkofthebeast @iowahawkblog @BridgetPhetasy You‚Äôre complete right, it‚Äôs not comparable. The Wayne outrage just reminded me of it and how I felt at the time about how insane there wasn‚Äôt more outrage about Tango.
@smarkofthebeast @iowahawkblog @BridgetPhetasy I should‚Äôve said audiences were ‚Äúcoerced‚Äù into seeing Last Tango and praising it. That‚Äôs more accurate
The Reagan administration and Reaganism are like herpes. They horribly violated human rights around the world, their ‚Äúforeign policy‚Äù was a failure, yet they keep popping up in our gov‚Äôt over and over again.	The US is in an abusive relationship with the Reagan administration. https://t.co/6WH9rMS9ys
@fivefifths Do we thank big tobacco for speeding up Wayne‚Äôs cancellation?
@smarkofthebeast @iowahawkblog @BridgetPhetasy Sorry that I keep going on, it‚Äôs just extremely upsetting and unsettling to me that this film is still praised and people can still buy it and watch a sex crime in action
@smarkofthebeast @iowahawkblog @BridgetPhetasy Yerp good advice
@smarkofthebeast @iowahawkblog @BridgetPhetasy And on top of that the two perpetrators received praise and acclaim from critics and audiences. That poor woman...they nominated these guys for sexually assaulting her and displaying it on movie screens for all to see https://t.co/aJO0vxv0pN
@smarkofthebeast @iowahawkblog @BridgetPhetasy That‚Äôs some super sick shit to pull. Sexually assault a woman on camera knowing audiences will believe it‚Äôs all acting. Like wtf? Filming a vile crime and then trick people into watching it under false pretenses
@smarkofthebeast @iowahawkblog @BridgetPhetasy There was, but a *very* minor one. Which was surprising because it came out in the midst of MeToo. There should‚Äôve been a tsunami, because ffs this is MUCH worse than Wayne. I mean the director and Brando had audiences watching this believing they were watching 2 people acting.

@EmmaKennedy @CassandraRules This was beyond ‚Äúfast and loose‚Äù though. I find it hilarious he blamed it on someone who works for him while claiming for weeks to be broker than broke. How‚Äôs he paying this employee?
@rulege @mitchellreports @jeffmason1 Lol
@rulege @michaeljknowles And that‚Äôs what they all report on now, each other

@rulege @michaeljknowles I mean this is just like yesterday when conservatives pointed out every journo that didn‚Äôt imply that the Jussie story was alleged or openly accepted it to combat the spin that the media‚Äôs hands were clean. Neither side of the street is clean, they‚Äôre all hypocrites

@MEPFuller @noonanjo Omg silly me I forgot to include that he created a Food Stamp program and expanded Employment Offices.
@noonanjo @MEPFuller He asked what the tax rates were under jfk in the most straight forward way possible
@MEPFuller @noonanjo Also JFK raised the min wage, expanded the Medicare program, expanded social security, lowered the retirement age, as well as did his tax cut which focused primarily on the middle class though all got a cut.
@marc_lotter @DonaldJTrumpJr No, but Trump doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a humanitarian crisis on the Central American side like Obama did, he‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs a humanitarian crisis on our side

@rmck51337 @emmy_louise_ @KatrinaPierson The only 3 black senators introduced it in June. It wasnt just Booker and Harris, the bill was a bipartisan effort with Republican Tim Scott.

@JoelGardenier @DLoesch You needed a second job to pay for health insurance when if you‚Äôre working full time in 1 job they legally have to offer you insurance? Usually atva reduced rate because they have to pay for some of it. 	Why do you have a 2nd job again?
@lilyonamission7 @DLoesch A side hustle is the same thing as having a second job. No, you‚Äôre probably not working a specific amount of hours a week or getting a wage from a company, but it‚Äôs still considered a job

@davidmweissman It‚Äôs weird too because this has already been settled by the Supreme Court. No one has to say the pledge and they cannot be forced to

@ABtotha3 @dcexaminer That‚Äôs not bigotry
@dorothyofisrael The one country the US defends in every way? No, it isn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs not antisemitic. Ffs it‚Äôs a country, not a religion , and the govt there is shit
@dorothyofisrael I didn‚Äôt. The idea that because he hasn‚Äôt spoken as much about one as the other isn‚Äôt gaslighting. The US and Israel are joined at the hip. Comparing a response to other countries is in bad faith

@gregmendozave @marcorubio The death toll wasn‚Äôt that high, but yes it was too high and unacceptable. 	The president‚Äôs policies were failing miserably and the country ended up in the state it is now‚Äîexcept with an even larger income gap between the top &amp; the bottom. 	Venezuelans fairly elected Chavez twice
@BridgetPhetasy I‚Äôm taking that ‚Äúlike‚Äù as a definitely maybe
@Cooper24148231 Thank you for proving my point that id waste my time engaging with you anymore. Have a nice night
@gregmendozave @marcorubio I haven‚Äôt been hypocritical. Chavez was involved in 1 failed coup attempt in 92, he was in jail during the time of the 2nd. There‚Äôs absolutely no reason the US wouldve been involved.	When Chavez was pardoned he ran for president in a fair election and your people elected him
@Cooper24148231 No matter what I say you‚Äôll brush it off. It doesn‚Äôt matter the amount of bodies or scenarios I give you so I‚Äôm not going to waste my time. You came at me to start shit, not discuss or debate. I‚Äôm not continuing this when you already started in bad faith

@LozanoAuthor @MrAndyNgo @KevinMKruse Who the fuck ever said I was a real human being?
@sterlinginks @Kyle_Beckley @BridgetPhetasy I think we‚Äôre about 90% in agreement. 		I should‚Äôve pointed out early on that I am not a socialist. I feel like people seeing this conversation are going to try and back me into a corner screaming about how bad socialism is trying to get me to defend it
@Cooper24148231 @sterlinginks @Kyle_Beckley @BridgetPhetasy I addressed your first point already. Yes some truly are.		as to your second point I fucking hate Bernie and I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre referring to so I can‚Äôt answer that. 		3rd Nazism isn‚Äôt about economic policies, it‚Äôs a strictly hateful ideology.
@sterlinginks @Kyle_Beckley @BridgetPhetasy I completely get that, but in this day and age the pragmatic part feels as if it‚Äôs been throughly abandoned. Societal health (economically and physically‚Äîex. Flint) has taken a back seat to the natural self interest of greed. A balance needs to be struck somewhere in between
@sterlinginks @Kyle_Beckley @BridgetPhetasy Why would I? Seem reasonable enough to me. Plus, anyone who wastes their time on here just to yell at people and call them names can fuck waaaay off

@MrAndyNgo @KevinMKruse @TuckerCarlson Cool cool cool journalist who can‚Äôt interpret the meaning of sentences correctly, or is it just purposely acts in bad faith?
@spandabelike @AG_Conservative I know. Almost nothing put forth has actually been socialist. Period. It‚Äôs all scare tactics to bring up images of bread lines and mass murder.
@sterlinginks @Kyle_Beckley @BridgetPhetasy I‚Äôm just tired of this constant right wing push toward Laissez faire which is just as bad if not worse. Too many have been convinced private entities and businesses have society‚Äôs interests at heart, therefore work best without the red tape of regulations or oversight. Its insane
@sterlinginks @Kyle_Beckley @BridgetPhetasy Or if you‚Äôre going to label me that, then fine, I am that, and I will call myself that and begin striking down the preconceived notion of what being that means through my public actions. The people will then see the reality of who I am and it‚Äôll take away the venom of that word
@sterlinginks @Kyle_Beckley @BridgetPhetasy I‚Äôve always felt those using Socialism to describe their ideology are using in like how black people took ownership of the N-word (an extreme example but the only one I can come up with). You‚Äôre calling me that like it‚Äôs a bad thing, but I‚Äôm taking it back &amp; making it empowering
@Kyle_Beckley @BridgetPhetasy Simplest way to put this is that both sides are lying when they say the term socialism or socialist policies. Besides the really extremely radical crazies on the far far far far far left no one is actually using it As the correct definition for their/someone‚Äôs ideology
@Kyle_Beckley @BridgetPhetasy When people say building roads is socialism they‚Äôre using the US definition I‚Äôve socialism, in other words anything not done or overseen by private entities or corporations
@Kyle_Beckley @BridgetPhetasy Because the US redefined the term socialism to encompass any policy or system left of Laissez faire for political purposes, often to invoke the imagery of the brutality and poverty we‚Äôve seen in communist nations.
@AG_Conservative ‚ÄúSocialist policies‚Äù is pretty much a bullshit term when said policies will still end up existing within a free market capitalist society. It‚Äôs more stepping away from the horrific policy of Laissez faire
@BridgetPhetasy It‚Äôd be great if kept saying none of it‚Äôs socialism, because none of it actually is
@AG_Conservative Wealth tax or a higher income tax for the top tax bracket isn‚Äôt socialism.
@kylenabecker @KevinMKruse So because he didn‚Äôt know it was a hoax right away therefore his interpretations of history backed with evidence isn‚Äôt reliable? 2+2=Zebra?
@davidfrum It doesn‚Äôt matter, his whole premise is based upon a falsely attributed Marx quote.
@horowitz39 Technically the quote is from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe used later by Engels to describe Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel‚Äôs revolutionary method

@BridgetPhetasy I believe it‚Äôs very self aware, but sadly the writer‚Äôs reasoning isn‚Äôt as clear as it should‚Äôve been because the line about ‚Äúleftist conspiracy‚Äù, Trump supports, &amp; fake news trips up readers &amp; distracts from the core argument‚Äîbeing this‚Äôll be forever used as a way to deny racism
@gregmendozave @marcorubio You‚Äôre not getting liberators who care about your freedom, your people, human rights, or democracy. Letting the US be apart of this process you‚Äôll only replace one murderous thief with an entire crime syndicate. There won‚Äôt be fair elections &amp; ur wealth will continue to be stolen

@DebbieAAldrich @valeriestrauss But what about my idea/suggestion to address this situation you perceive in order to bring balance? Why not encourage more conservatives to become teachers?
@DebbieAAldrich @valeriestrauss I also will NEVER defend Charter schools, I‚Äôm strictly talking about public schools. Claiming it exists because you just have a feeling isn‚Äôt evidence of some liberal globalist conspiracy to indoctrinate children with their agenda. Although less, there are many conserve teachers
@DebbieAAldrich @valeriestrauss Forced to watch what on CNN and why? That‚Äôs important, because I know teachers who start their classes with a 3 minute CNN overview of current events, which is definitely not bias. There‚Äôs no time for bias, it‚Äôs just headline reading
@BridgetPhetasy Thank you for coming to my TED talk about how I can‚Äôt fucking stand people and the media shitshow
@BridgetPhetasy I‚Äôm so fucking tired of this bullshit. It‚Äôs nothing but a pendulum swinging back and forth from one self righteous mob to the other, and they‚Äôre both always disingenuous and exaggerating
@BridgetPhetasy It‚Äôs the worst, most idiotic trend that‚Äôs occurred. Not even apologies are accepted from one side of the political spectrum to the other. And even after an apology or an acknowledgement of falling short, the other side ignores it &amp; continually uses the original incident as smear
@BridgetPhetasy Media reporting on media‚Äî using airtime to debate the state of media‚Äîmedia ruminating on where the media has gone wrong and how to improve reporting going forward‚Äîmedia accusing other media of biases‚Äîmedia making fun of other media...	This is what our news has become.
@jdrisco04 @marcorubio @MarioDB @AmbCTrujillo I mean, yes, Maduro should step down, but no, the US intervening with forceful propaganda is not the way. The US cannot be trusted in regards to South America
@gregmendozave @marcorubio It‚Äôs on the top of South America bordering Central America. 	I‚Äôm not disputing that, Maduro should be ousted and fair elections held, but the USA is not the country to trust with this.
@xavi42 @marcorubio @MarioDB @AmbCTrujillo Your immediate reaction to insult me and not dispute what I said with any evidence is very telling

This is the same exact tactic used by Elliott Abrams in the 80‚Äôs, except ‚Äúhumanitarian aid‚Äù was a cover to supply the rebels with weapons. What‚Äôs really going on Rubio?
@marcorubio @MarioDB @AmbCTrujillo So you‚Äôre completely ignoring the fact that they receive aid from other countries and international organizations. You‚Äôve been asked by aid orgs to stop this farce and propaganda. You‚Äôre using the Elliott Abrams playbook of using ‚Äúhumanitarian aid‚Äù as a weapon

@dsachico @PortiaABoulger Gofundme‚Äôs medical business wasn‚Äôt much of a thing until a couple years ago with insulin prices up, epipens, etc. Yes, severe situations, like those with cancer who were freelancers (pre-Ocare) used it, but that‚Äôs about it.

@gabrielmalor This is the first time I‚Äôve ever had an inside source on anything this big and I‚Äôm not gonna lie, it feels cool as hell
@emzanotti A twitter mob isn‚Äôt the same thing as journalists and MSM reports. All of you seem to be upset by what randos on twitter yelled at you and not the reality of what and how msm reported this
@gabrielmalor Well yes and no. It‚Äôs lord of the rings, but the history leading up to the hobbit and LOTR trilogy. So stuff from ‚ÄúThe Silmarillion‚Äù and ‚ÄúUnfinished Tales of N√∫menor and Middle-earth‚Äù will be in it, as well as historical events referred to in the novels little is written on
@gabrielmalor I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôve written this in any sort of pr statement, so dunno if it‚Äôs public knowledge, I just happen to know someone working on it and it came up in casual convo
@CharlesMBlow This story narrative is fishier than the original
@TeaPartyRodT A-fuckin-men. It‚Äôs idiotic for parties to not run someone in each and every single district. You honestly never know what will happen.
@gabrielmalor I‚Äôve got the inside scoop on the show. It‚Äôs going to take place 100 years before the hobbit using the info Tolkien write about the mythology and history of  middle earth
@TeaPartyRodT I mean if that‚Äôs it, yeah. It‚Äôs idiotic not to run a candidate in every single district regardless of political leanings
@TeaPartyRodT The point is why not fight for those seats?

@ParkerMolloy @nycsouthpaw There‚Äôs a whole new genre of bad faith right wing reporting I‚Äôd call muckraking the media
@ParkerMolloy @nycsouthpaw I just said the same damn thing. All the stories about this have been pretty straightforward fact based reporting. Yeah there were some opinion columns, but then again if they‚Äôre pointing to those your conflating opinions with actual reporting.
@MAGAnum45 @Ozmanitis @KamVTV You can‚Äôt destroy something that‚Äôs already a dumpster fire
@SopanDeb It‚Äôs because right wing Twitter nowadays likes to conflate liberal twitter and MSM. Because of what they saw from lefties on Twitter they believe it‚Äôs the actual way the story is being covered. Almost every piece I read on this didn‚Äôt implicate anything but the facts
@TeaPartyRodT Ok but what‚Äôs the big deal? Thereve been resettlements for decades
@tjfriden Lol ffs that‚Äôs like when people say shit like ‚ÄúMSM didn‚Äôt report it‚Äù when often times at least one or two outlets did. This is the stupidest attempt to prove me wrong on that I‚Äôve ever seen
@bad_takes Just when I thought ‚ÄúAttack of the clones‚Äù couldn‚Äôt be worse
@tjfriden Oh my God I didn‚Äôt say any place didn‚Äôt write headlines like that, but a lot didn‚Äôt and the one he was reacting to specifically was the New York Times
@NoShitDept @RLHeinrichs @peterjhasson @redsteeze Not exactly. The intelligence Reports were altered or exaggerated by the bush administration. I know that sounds like some conspiracy bullshit but it‚Äôs been proven And is now common knowledge
@TeaPartyRodT That‚Äôs weird because I knew about it, and I‚Äôm well aware of the Minnesota isn‚Äôt the only State where there is refugee resettlement occurring
@tjfriden OK cool, but all the above ‚Äúallegedly‚Äù happened and when the media wrote about it they wrote ‚Äúracially charged‚Äù In the headlines instead of ‚Äúracist‚Äù ‚Äúracism‚Äù or ‚Äúhate crime‚Äù.	Whether it all turned out to be true or not in no way factors into those word choices
@TeaPartyRodT What do you mean ‚Äúcalling it out‚Äù? 	I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve even known about it if it weren‚Äôt reported somewhere in the msm
@waltshaub üò±üôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè https://t.co/mfsdo3q2nu
@TeaPartyRodT Calling out what exactly? I don‚Äôt understand. Just the fact that there are refugee resettlement there in Minnesota?
@TeaPartyRodT Wrong. One has better cocaine and more of it
@TeaPartyRodT Proving you right about what? It was well known that refugee settlements were being made in Minnesota
@aravosis I‚Äôm 100% with you. The original narrative was fishy, but this new narrative is just as fishy if not more

@KevinMKruse @nickmon1112 I‚Äôm confused Kevin, he says you jump to conclusions and yet it seems your tweet wasn‚Äôt about the case at all, It was a reaction to headlines reporting it using phrases like racially tinged, right? 	In other words journalist Nick here doesn‚Äôt fully understand how language works
@nickmon1112 Weird how you don‚Äôt grasp that is tweet was solely directed at media calling it ‚Äúracially tinged‚Äù attack instead of calling it racist. There‚Äôs absolutely no judgment in that tweet about what happened. You are aware how language works right?
@nickmon1112 @KevinMKruse ...all he‚Äôs reacting to is reporters calling it ‚Äúracially charged‚Äù		How is telling reporters to use the correct term politically charged or reactionary?

@Timmythe_Hutt @redsteeze @StephenAtHome We don‚Äôt know that he attacked Zimmerman. There were zero witnesses. He didn‚Äôt just feel it, zimmerman was following him as evident by the 911 call.
@Timmythe_Hutt @jontheharris @redsteeze @StephenAtHome No, he didn‚Äôt. This is one of the few times he did. The bastard shot a goddamn kid. A scrawny 15 year old kid who didn‚Äôt do shit but a grown man stalked him anyway
@jontheharris @Timmythe_Hutt @redsteeze @StephenAtHome Nope, there weren‚Äôt any tools, just skittles
@Timmythe_Hutt @redsteeze @StephenAtHome He called 911 and was specifically told not to follow or engage‚Äîhe did anyway. Why the hell is a grown ass man following a kid around a neighborhood on a rainy night? F u

@jasonlwizz @timheidecker @DTenenbaum @FreedomWorks It isn‚Äôt considered a parody, because they arnt parodying the copyrighted material, they‚Äôre using the material to lampoon a members of a political party.
@jasonlwizz @timheidecker @DTenenbaum @FreedomWorks That‚Äôs been an on going debate in law. This, however, is not simply just any old meme.

@blogdiva Also none of the reports about Aid to Venezuela make note that they‚Äôre already getting aid from other countries and humanitarian groups, Maduro is only refusing US aid
@blogdiva Yes, it‚Äôs a photo op, and the US sending aid was supposedly found out by the press due to a ‚Äúleaked‚Äù govt e-mail. The AP ran with that story yesterday and I almost set my fukken computer on fire. The fake document leak &amp; photo op are techniques used to manipulate public opinion
@RobProvince @owillis Focus on a single argument Rob! 	We‚Äôre talking about the personal interactions press have with candidates on the campaign trail.  	How the press treated Obama over his 8 years has absolutely nothing to do with the original subject.
@eScarry @NancyLStudio That‚Äôs the theory, but there‚Äôs almost no evidence of this happening. In fact most of the time companies don‚Äôt follow through on their promises often hiring much fewer people at lower pay rates than they said. Yet, cities keep doing this BS
@JenaFriedman Like...a puppy?
@RobProvince @owillis Lmfao! Ok? And? What does that have to do with any of this exactly?
@Sharon11776717 @brithume Yeah, he‚Äôs a journalist for Fox, a station in which many of his colleagues went and played golf with trump during the campaign, stayed at his hotels, etc. and weren‚Äôt shy about mentioning it on air
@RobProvince @owillis When youve done nothing but shit on the press that doesn‚Äôt happen. 	But Fox News on the other hand, lots of those folks played golf with him during the campaign and mentioned it on air. Hell, even joe Scarborough
@ljalawless @RedTRaccoon @CNN Most did during his campaign
@imchrisnorris @JeffJinSD @danpfeiffer I mean it‚Äôs a possibility, but doubtful. Such a leak would end up being bad for business as they‚Äôd be seen as untrustworthy
@owillis @RobProvince Pretending like this isn‚Äôt how shits been covered in campaign trails forever is fuuuuuckkkkking ridiculous. The candidates are ALWAYS interacting with the reporters following them on the trail
RT @MollyJongFast: Dolphins getting high huffing pufferfish is the future libertarians and liberals want. https://t.co/7qezJSgAPc
@JayCaruso It‚Äôs like some weird creepy stalking shit conservatives are doing always commenting on every single move she or her team makes. Most of it is banal shit shot through the outrage cannon into the echo chamber

@owillis I also love the fantasy action movie scenarios he pictures the left doing to confiscate his guns. Kicking the door down, busting into his house, armed to the teeth like it‚Äôs an FBI raid
@JeffJinSD @danpfeiffer It reads like a press release, not a leak. I mean it even goes into details like the production company hired.
@danpfeiffer It‚Äôs almost like...it‚Äôs not a leak and was purposely talked about with the press. I mean, look at in-depth details like the production company they hired for it. This is written like a press release, not like a leak
@petersthoughts They have actually. It‚Äôs not an admission that takes the media spotlight, so you may not have heard about it. Within interviews is where I‚Äôve seen/heard it
@brithume Are you purposely pretending not to know how campaigns are covered and the interactions between candidates &amp; the journalists following them on the campaign trail?

@mdcohen @allahpundit @NateSilver538 That‚Äôs not what he said. He‚Äôs talking about few not willing to go against trumps base, I‚Äôm saying congressmen are ignoring the disparity between what the voters at home have shown vs the trump agenda.

@Riginal_Zin @blogdiva Because at that percise moment everything about a person doesn‚Äôt matter. Using Kamala as an example again, if she weren‚Äôt who she is and got pulled over, a cop wounldnt look at her &amp; see a half Indian/half black woman who married a white man, he just sees a black woman
@Riginal_Zin @blogdiva Oh and to add onto my black people giving a black purity test: why would they do this? To me it seems the only purity test for a black person (or POC) is how police officers treat you when they pull you over? If they look at you and see you as black, than you‚Äôre black
@Riginal_Zin @blogdiva Hahaha gotcha. Seriously though, I feel an important document like this suffers quite a bit by using sterilized language and terms to stay within the accepted boundaries of academia
@Riginal_Zin @blogdiva Did I miss something?
@RLHeinrichs @peterjhasson @redsteeze The thing is they‚Äôve admitted to it, and most of us libs admit our blindness to it as well. I don‚Äôt understand why we keep harping on what theyve owned up to as a grave error and miscalculation on their part
@vladsavov Agreed. We only have about 4 bright young minds, the rest of us are pretty damn dumb.
@Riginal_Zin @blogdiva I feel like the definitions should‚Äôve been harsher in order to be more clear.

@NomikiKonst @DKThomp Quick question for @DKThomp: besides escalating housing prices, wouldn‚Äôt the strain of +25,000 people on our already over strained &amp; broken subway system also make the deal a zero sum gain? The $$ NYC would take in vs. accelerating the need for repairs &amp; $$ for such repairs
@davidmweissman ...but in the case of Rush and Hannity (as well as many other right commentators) it puts on display their attitudes (I‚Äôm right, you‚Äôre wrong. I refuse to listen to other perspectives &amp; think about it) &amp; reveals why there‚Äôs a strong anti-higher education sentiment on the right.
@davidmweissman Although I fukken hate tucker Carlson, every once and awhile he slips his act off and you catch a glimpse of a well educated man with well thought out opinions (even if I disagree with them).	Granted, I‚Äôm not saying one needs to go to college to learn such info...

@TeaPartyRodT I could defend it, I could also whataboutism the charges of golf cart rentals &amp; more for SS under Trump, but this is getting away from the point. The emoluments clause as it pertains to foreign govts was broken by trump and is an impeachable offensive
@curiouscalvin00 @TPCarney @E__Strobel I mean you‚Äôre right that I don‚Äôt like amazon as a corporation, but that‚Äôs not why I oppose the HQ being built in ny. I‚Äôd oppose this regardless of the company
@curiouscalvin00 @TPCarney @E__Strobel And that‚Äôs just it, the current numbers are already through the roof and the system is already in desperate need of repairs and upgrades. Adding 25,000 more people is a lot of strain on the 100 year old system
@TeaPartyRodT The books were also bought by US embassies, which still is shady af, but doesn‚Äôt fall under emoluments. 	Trump has actual deals, property, and hotels internationally in which he hasn‚Äôt even put in a real blind trust. The money other govts spend there goes straight into his pocket
@curiouscalvin00 @TPCarney @E__Strobel Obviously you don‚Äôt know the NYC subways very well. 25,000 more people daily at least 2x a day is A LOT
@TeaPartyRodT You realize the last book came out in 2006 so there were 2 years before he became president. Copyright grants would‚Äôve been sought by pub in the foreign countries who made deals for the rights with original pub. The idea that govts could gift him rights to his own books is absurd

@TeaPartyRodT For what? He wasn‚Äôt profiting off of the presidency through a business or receiving patents potentially worth millions
@TimJGraham @AOC Ok?
@mschlapp Yet you have no idea about what he‚Äôs actually found.
@TPCarney @jbhenchman My argument is 25,000 new people means more wear on the already over-stressed infrastructure. Subways are already a disaster, and driving isn‚Äôt much better. The cost of adding 25,000 more people daily &amp; damaging it all more would likely be more $$ than the taxes &amp; subsidies

@marcorubio @dmartosko Fukk you Rubio. She‚Äôs not the one who aided, abetted, and covered up genocides, so she has a higher moral standing than Abrams on this. The fact you‚Äôre supporting a criminal with a shitty record on human rights is disgraceful. Shame on you
@mrbigdubya @JerryDunleavy Yes it is, but it‚Äôs hardly anything to latch onto unless the intent is saying ‚Äúlook at this idiot asking questions,‚Äù which is downplaying the actual content
@CassandraRules No prob. Most on the right will completely gloss over the fact that this is a problem and instead keep arguing in bad faith about farting cows. Everyone knows the problem they‚Äôre talking about

@Reaganista He shouldn‚Äôt be held up as a good example for anything. Plus it took years and years of international pressure for him to finally cave and allow for the elections to happen. As far as Maduro, Everyone has a right to be suspicious after the 48 hr US/Abrams backed coup in 2002

@Bmac0507 Do you not understand how a court works and what a plea deal is?

@brithume @KFILE ‚ÄúVeiled‚Äù? It‚Äôs not exactly veiled. The entire last sentence is a throwaway, it‚Äôs not needed and serves seemingly serves no purpose. Why write in then unless he‚Äôs purposely going out of his way to get the word ‚ÄúTrail‚Äù in there. And ffs he knew about wounded knee
@SheriffClarke So like...republicans should make healthcare more available and easier to procure for millions of democratic families across the nation?
@epomero @Uncle_Jimbo Who said they knew Empire or were hillbillies?
@dmartosko No it‚Äôs not an open question. He went out of his way to get the word trail in there. The last sentence is completely unneeded  and unnecessary to get his point across
Oh yikes...‚Äùnot 1 dollar for DHS‚Äù is a pretty damn huge gaffe https://t.co/4vsOTIQCdx
@Uncle_Jimbo Yeah, because cardillo is known for his reliable sources üôÑ

@TianaTheFirst Also you‚Äôre conjecturing that they didn‚Äôt read the proposal. It‚Äôs quite possible they received a proposal with that already removed. Obviously at least one dem read this version and said ‚Äútake that out‚Äù

@JCEdmund @qzex21a @keiththetriple @Fuckin_USMC @GinoJoseman @thehill @AOC If you *actually* look at circumstances of what‚Äôs really going on you‚Äôd know that a trafficker it‚Äôs rare for traffickers to fake being a child‚Äôs parent to get them over the border. It makes no sense to do so when they‚Äôll be put in detention centers awaiting trial for asylum
@TianaTheFirst Either way it‚Äôs not in the actual bill Dem leaders are endorsing so it really doesn‚Äôt matter.
@existentialfish I‚Äôm confused...‚Äùthey‚Äôre taking out the question asked, which was not about Hitler.‚Äù 	How on earth does anyone think ‚ÄúThere was a question that had nothing to do with Hitler and I decided to answer by talking about Hitler,‚Äù is a defense?

@GOP @SecAzar Weird how he says ‚Äúis Medicare for none‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt talk once about it not covering the entire population. 	I mean ‚Äúit‚Äôll undermine the private insurance agencies‚Äù is not an argument against Medicare for All‚Äôs coverage
@JerryDunleavy That‚Äôs fine, but what‚Äôs with the trying to compare this to Kavanaugh? Kavanaugh was a nominee for a seat on the most powerful court in the US, fairfax is just a (deputy gov?) of Virginia. I know this last point is a bit of a cop out, but ones related to her job, the other isnt.
@emzanotti Yeah, AOC‚Äôs team F‚Äôed up big time. Seems like they maybe just posted the version they wanted, which isn‚Äôt the actual bill at all
@umairh @Ez4u2say_Janis Or because of the white patriarchy we have more white men writing at high level magazines and papers, and because of this white male population is the majority in newsrooms you have a majority who see themselves in Beto.

@emzanotti @KatrinaPierson Please @emzanotti, do enlighten me, where on the internet was her credit score posted and housing record showing two evictions?

@andraydomise @ebruenig @DavidDark It‚Äôs also possible I could just be completely and utterly full of shit, which is certainly a theory I‚Äôve been kicking around for awhile
@andraydomise @ebruenig @DavidDark I dunno how to describe it if youve never felt it. 	On the other hand there also is both conscious &amp; subconscious racism that is more common, because an honest, pure blind rage rarely occurs in the average person. Liam i believe had this moment &amp; still doesn‚Äôt understand it.
@andraydomise @ebruenig @DavidDark Not necessarily, because at the moment youre running on solely on the programming that society has reenforced time &amp; time again. What‚Äôs scary is at moments like these we can do evil things we never even thought we were capable of or ever thought of.
@andraydomise @ebruenig @DavidDark Your own thoughts, feelings, personality go straight out the window. Whatever is instinctually or learned behaviors formed by simply living in a society of biases (really brainwashing) is what you become. Does me going after a Blackman mean I‚Äôm racist &amp; that‚Äôs my true being?
@andraydomise @ebruenig @DavidDark ...You‚Äôre no longer working as a functioning human being, your movement, actions, thoughts are knee jerk instinctual or reenforced learned behaviors. It‚Äôs your body, but it‚Äôs not you anymore. Your mind isn‚Äôt processing, it does nothing but react
@andraydomise @ebruenig @DavidDark I honestly dunno ardent‚Äôs work so I may be hitting on some of the same things. Anyway have you ever been in a pure blind rage that‚Äôs so strong it over takes you to the point of feeling possessed? The brain doesn‚Äôt function rationally &amp; bypasses receiving &amp; processing info...
@andraydomise @ebruenig @DavidDark I don‚Äôt know if Its black paranoia of the white male exactly. In some cases, yes it‚Äôs innate, in most though I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a mixture of lifelong brainwashing from tele &amp; news that disportiately show black people doing crimes and a complete blind rage‚Äîseeing red
@CortesSteve That myth has been debunked since the Reagan era.

@ManMadeMoon @Ez4u2say_Janis I‚Äôd say it was the best photo I‚Äôve ever seen of him, because the aura and the shield Of being THE David Bowie was completely gone. I‚Äôve never seen another photo of him like that. It‚Äôs beautiful.	Btw I mean Wooster college‚Äôs FB Page when I said ‚Äúthey posted‚Äù
@ManMadeMoon @Ez4u2say_Janis This is awesome! 	Ps, my ex went to Wooster and the day your father passed they posted a picture of him attending your graduation, smiling, and snapping photos leaning against a tree with a caption that read something like, ‚ÄúHe was a plain old proud parent that day‚Äù
@RobProvince It‚Äôs depressing that all the normal citizen Liberals are screaming resign, yet those in office have been too silent
Can we stop calling assholes ‚Äúprovocateurs‚Äù? Theyre assholes, just say theyre assholes. They make a living being assholes. Yeah, theyre provoking, but b/c theyre assholes. You dont just decide to be a provocateur. No, you were an asshole who grew up to be an adult sized asshole.

@KevinMKruse ...decades after Jolson‚Äôs demise, fellow vaudevillians like George Burns and Jack Benny would lament how sad it was that Jolson will forever be known for Blackface, because they say he was the greatest entertainer they‚Äôd ever seen without it. He had it all: singing, dance, wit
@KevinMKruse Wait, is this an actual piece written by D‚ÄôSouza? He literally did just completely skip the entire vaudevillian era? 	Ffs Al Jolson was the most popular entertainer in the US for YEARS! Blackface wasn‚Äôt his whole act, but it was a big part of it. (Sidenote...
@KevinMKruse I mean you‚Äôd have to ignore vaudeville and silent film (as well as the first sound film The Jazz Singer) entirely to actually say ‚Äúit was always the Democrats!‚Äù This was HUGELY popular entertainment for all ends of the political spectrum‚Äîespecially in the Vaudville days

@lindseyhurd @EricBoehlert I‚Äôm stating exactly what I‚Äôve gotten out of her clarifications. The DNA test &amp; etc were never a part of her explanation.
@rpbp Sounds on par with stupid argument against the 16 year old immigrant in detention getting an abortion. Ignoring the present law and pulling ridiculous crap outta his ass. I mean his argument was ‚Äúwe need to wait for her to get a sponsor‚Äù which is no where in law? Ffs
@RadioFreeTom I mean they‚Äôre literally just wearing the label the right would try to smear them with anyway. It‚Äôs actually a smart move, because if their policy ideas gain traction and the Repubs cry ‚ÄúSOCIALISM‚Äù the public reaction becomes ‚ÄúWe know, it‚Äôs in their name.‚Äù
@mujer_cita_MIA I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôd be perks just not outright cash
@CLEmomma @RobProvince @JohnDeVore Ill accept that
@rpbp So pretty much his reasoning was not really a practical reason at all? Huh
@RadioFreeTom Devil‚Äôs advocate: no it‚Äôs not true socialism in anyway shape or form, but the left has adopted the term because for generations the right has used the term ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù to describe any progressive policy put forth. US Dem Socialists r using the term Repubs would call them anyway
@blogdiva I dunno...I think it‚Äôd be thrilling to be sent a pic of a dick that‚Äôs worth almost 1 trillion dollars
@CLEmomma @RobProvince @JohnDeVore 70% tax on the rich is definitely not a dumb take. In fact I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs the sanest take I‚Äôve heard from a politician yet. Ever since Reagan cut the top‚Äôs taxes everyone‚Äôs been afraid to raise it again after his experiment has failed over and over
@brenda11831 @guypbenson There‚Äôs an insightful one on Roger Stone that they acquired two years ago. It‚Äôs weird that a good business decision about buying movie rights is seen as partisan

@yashar Wtf? Do they all say the quiet part out loud?!?

‚ÄúEvictions‚Äù 	As in the one time after her dad died &amp; her family couldnt afford to make house payments, but scraped together what they could she &amp; her brother put their names on the lease in order to get the house back?

@RobProvince @JohnDeVore Lol Say about what? What have they said are we‚Äôll polling bipartisan policies Trump has put forth? The wall has been his only policy, everything else  has always been due to someone else‚Äôs lead. As long as it makes him look good he doesn‚Äôt care
@lormzic @jsolomonReports @drawandstrike Its not a report, it‚Äôs an opinion piece
@RobProvince @JohnDeVore Except she actually works and a lot of her ideas arnt outlandish or unpopular, like the 70% income tax for those making over 10mil? That‚Äôs polling well regardless of party and no, it‚Äôs not socialism, it‚Äôs as American as football.
@RobProvince @JohnDeVore Lol keep underestimating her. People doing exactly that is how she got to where she is.
@RobProvince @JohnDeVore Do you honestly think she believes that people are going to think everything in the gnd is possible? Shes shifting the Overton window by proposing radical changes and getting DC to talk about issues they‚Äôve mostly avoided.
@RobProvince @JohnDeVore Yeah, and so did she.
@KevinMKruse @soledadobrien But how about that Howard Taft dick tintype you coulda made up on live tv to give it a historical perspective. You could dine off of that story for centuries

@lyndseyfifield @senatemajldr Not to mention the other week when the senator from Colorado tore ted Cruz a new asshole.

@lyndseyfifield @senatemajldr She didn‚Äôt break senate rules, she was reading a document already in the record that Loretta scott king wrote about Jeff Sessions when he was rejected years before. Ffs @senatemajldr If it were about that rule he would‚Äôve silenced Ted Cruz went apeshit on him.
@GOPChairwoman Republicans screaming ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù is the political equivalent of the boy who cried Wolf
@alt_uscbp @joncoopertweets Yup! All this! This is why I didn‚Äôt vote in this poll. Also the original intention matters. For instance doing it to look like Curtis blow for a costume because you love Curtis blow is still wrong &amp; hurtful, but its much better than doing it as mockery

@Noahpinion Btw we NEED to get public works back to the way it was! All our infrastructure was built during that time in the 30s-40s-50s and so much of it needs to be upgraded
@Noahpinion He was right. Work does matter. I‚Äôve never worked with a poor person who wouldn‚Äôt go out of their way to get work. I worked with a lady at a seasonal job who had a 3 hour commute‚Äî2 bus rides and a subway ride‚Äîto get to that low paying gig. It was about pride for her.

@rulege @TianaTheFirst We would not have...well, pretty much all the infrastructure we have if it weren‚Äôt for the new deal.

@speechboy71 Seriously, how do you procure a new Joni Mitchell album and fail at selling it IN COFFEE SHOPS?!?
@speechboy71 The thing is he‚Äôs only successful in the business of coffee. He made a record label with built in distribution and it failed epically. Why are we going to trust him with the nation when he can‚Äôt successfully sell a Joni Mitchell album in the largest chain of coffee shops?
@rulege @EWErickson No, no they weren‚Äôt. I seriously hope you‚Äôre joking.
@owillis In fact you should be skeptical because when citizens in Nicaragua seized control of one of its largest cities, Masaya, months ago we didn‚Äôt do shit. Hell fox gave Ortega a softball interview. This is all about oil

@MrRBourne @AOC Supply side economics is a fantasy. It never works and never has simply because of greed. Not to mention rich folk are at their spending capacity, they‚Äôre not going to spend more b/c they saved 5 mil. It doesn‚Äôt happen
@MrRBourne @AOC Because ever since Reagan they‚Äôve played this garbage game of trickle down economics by cutting the Rich‚Äôs  taxes, and every single damn time it has FAILED! Reagan had to raise taxes on the middle class and poor 11 times to try &amp; keep this illusion going
@Harry1T6 @josh_hammer Does anyone read the article? He specifically says capitalism is good
@MrRBourne @AOC #1 is highly debated and will most likely always have a 50/50 split. 	Higher min wage does help poverty. The Kennedy tax cuts you guys reference constantly were balanced with higher min wage and expansion of social programs.

@raja_vaze @AG_Conservative @sunnyright Yeah I got it wrong I kniw
@MrRBourne @AOC From where I‚Äôm sitting she‚Äôs right. Arguments against minimum wage are ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôll put places out of business‚Äù which really means ‚Äúshut up and be happy you have any job that pays anything at all‚Äù
@MrRBourne @AOC Then what do conservatives actually think?
@AG_Conservative @sunnyright That‚Äôs not it Chief, that‚Äôs not at all why we have a 2 trillion dollar debt. The idea that the rich shouldn‚Äôt be taxed more is idiotic as well. All these hot takes that lead to letting them just keep their money will never be popular
