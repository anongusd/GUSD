The abuse of children or minors upends the pro-life ethic b/c it is a grave injustice &amp; an egregious offense against the dignity of the human person.Moreover,the failure to respond effectively to the abuse crisis undermines every other ministry within the Church. +Naumann
Anyone whose life is threatened and anyone whose human dignity is disrespected have a claim on our hearts. ‚Äî Archbishop Naumann #VigilMassforLife #WhyWeMarch #homilytweet https://t.co/V3qy0HoDZY
We are concerned about the life and dignity of the human person wherever it is threatened or diminished. ‚Äî Archbishop Naumann #WhyWeMarch #VigilMassforLife https://t.co/LL2PVyhHKL
Every abortion not only destroys the life of an innocent child,but it wounds &amp; scars mothers &amp; fathers who must live w/ the harsh reality they hired someone 2 destroy their daughter or son. In reality,welfare of parents &amp;their child are always intimately linked. #VigilMassforLife
Protecting the life of the unborn children is the pre-eminent human rights issue of our time, not only because of the sheer magnitude of the numbers, but because abortion attacks the sanctuary of life, the family. ‚Äî Archbishop Naumann #homilytweet #VigilMassforLife #WhyWeMarch https://t.co/DVoOTu5UhQ
The pro-life ethic challenges us to care about the sacredness of every human being throughout the life spectrum. We are called always and everywhere to promote the dignity of the human person. ‚Äî Archbishop Naumann #WhyWeMarch @MarysShrine https://t.co/igdS0xwWcT
