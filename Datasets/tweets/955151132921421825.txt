@Isuelt74 @ThomCincotta @SenatorDurbin @gaelbill I know (have known) many mexican/latin American immigrants (very possibly illegal) from a past workplace in the past and to say they were quality people would be huge understatement.

@Isuelt74 @ThomCincotta @SenatorDurbin @gaelbill Stolen by corrupt govt officials almost NEVER reaches intended use and often empowers more corruption. You used the term migrants and said they were in danger. LEGAL immigrants are not. I dont know what danger illegals are in, but they should be deported immediately.
@Isuelt74 @ThomCincotta @SenatorDurbin @gaelbill Haha, that is insane.  We're broke and our government is responsible for the American people.

@MaryWetton @RawStory Haha, I'm perfectly relaxed. You insinuated I was a few things that just aren't true. So if you're questioning with moral authorith my devotion to Master, you surely don't support/Celebrate Homosexuality or The murder of the unborn or any political party that does right?
@TheRealSwanee @RawStory @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I supported and prayed nightly for Cruz or Walker in primary but The Lord had other plans. The best thing we can do is pray earnestly for The Lord to keep this nation in His grasp. Godspeed and Happy New Year to you.
@TheRealSwanee @RawStory @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Nobody is perfect.  I agree with you on POTUS and it frustrates me indeed. I'm not God. Obama was no better a reflection of Jesus than Judas.

@MaryWetton @RawStory You just plainly proved you can dish it out but you have absolutely NO response. You despicably called two people fake Christians and when confronted had nothing to say. Typical hateful liberal. Zero substance but heavy on immature playground insults. GoodBye.

@MaryWetton @RawStory If I'm 'Homophobic' then your calling Master Jesus homophobic, (and The Bible for that matter) and I dread the day you have to tell Him He is a homophobe to His face.  Until then, i'll take the 'fake-christian' insult and count it as joy knowing that Master suffered much worse.
@MaryWetton @RawStory That His Lord would not have him celebrate, and should actually be FORCED by a government of fellow mortals to participate, then you can rebuke away, just please provide some scripture because I have PLENTY. And we wouldn't want any 'christianity' exposed by a 'Fake Christian'
@MaryWetton @RawStory And I'm affraid of Homosexuals?  Weeeird, never knew that. Pretty sure I know and am friends with many homosexuals, no phobias here. Now... if you're rebuking me as a 'fake-Christian' because I don't think a BIBLE BELIEVER ought to be ruined for refusing to celebrate something

@LeeMILBY @SenatorDurbin 'Bankrupt America'... So you railed against President Obama for adding 10 trillion to our national debt correct? I think President Trump actually just has American interests as priority (unlike you) and wants to stop lawlessness and honor LEGAL immigrants and LEGAL process.
@Judy577599 @SenatorDurbin So Judes, tell us YOUR plan to end illegal border crossings?
@spruoko @SenatorDurbin Because there are 11 million illegal alien americans squatting in Canada who illegally headed north with more yank convoys planning to illegally barge into Canada? #LeftyLogic
@AlertObserver @SenatorDurbin To track down illegals and deport them right? And for stopping ALL illegal border crossings? Tech alone wont cut it.
@OSU_deltagee94 @SenatorDurbin And your better plan for stopping  illegal immigration?
@spruoko @SenatorDurbin And that is the Responsibity of???
@TeachingDiva52 @SenatorDurbin Outrage! So what's your plan to stop llegal immigration?
@kelly_dodson @SenatorDurbin You mean illegal immigrants right? Please tell me you can distinguish between LEGAL and illegal... That is if the law means anything to you.

I'll ask God before bed that you'll ask Him if it's in His Will for you to head to your local G.O.P. office in next 90 days in time for what, by His Grace alone, WILL be a glorious victory for His Saints on NOV 6th!! Goid night Brother.
@JBrunskowski4 @LegendaryEnergy We do. Even as they are supposedelt emerging as 'Higher income better educated'  just look at DNC vs RNC Small $ donations and total advantage. We have massive advantage.
@JBrunskowski4 @LegendaryEnergy Yes. But we have grand majority of state houses, and dominate government because we are the Americans. They are the europeans. Dem registration drowns G.O.P. regiatration nation wide, but we have the TRUTH and the fire and Giddyup that goes with it. Marxists don't sacrifice like
@JBrunskowski4 @LegendaryEnergy And I know ut is hard to believe in culture you've correctly identified, but i go door 2 door there are  a TON of A-Political/Politically Luke Warm folks that are patriotic that don't necessarily want yard signs but are thrilled to hear about quality candidates. Work to be done!!
@JBrunskowski4 @LegendaryEnergy He was trying to light a rightous fire. No extinguishers, only lighter fluid. If it was just about you and me it would be different but its is about expending 90 days of Godly effort that doesn't compare to sacrifices before us to secure this Heavenly gift of a nation from evil.

@RockyMayra1818 Shut my mouth?
@RockyMayra1818 You're arguing that my moral concerns are less valid than yours simply because you say so. You assert that simply because of my Sex I am disqualified even arguing my heartfelt belief that abortion is barbaric and evil. So whatever you decide affects you and not me, i have to just
@WIFEofARIENZO This doesn't directly affect your life or body but you're saying it's disgusting and you're outraged about it. You..	are.. a...hypocrite. Typical Liberal.
@RockyMayra1818 Nope. I replied to your tweet which stated i had no right to defend the unborn because ending a totally innocent LIFE is supposedly a 'woman's right'...
@WIFEofARIENZO @RockyMayra1818 To end a life? I can make a decision to get drunk and drive home.  If a life ends in the process, other people are 'concerned' as they should be. That is what laws are for which keep us from something called anarchy.
@WIFEofARIENZO @RockyMayra1818 If i'm disqualified for worrying about the unborn simply because it's 'not my life' then you have no grounds to gripe about whatever the liberal rage of the day is if it doesn't directly affect you 'personally' from what i understand...
@WIFEofARIENZO @RockyMayra1818 But you used the fact that since it's not my body/life, even though i'm  appalled by legal slaughter of  innocent hunan life, i am discredited. So why aren't you discredited for espousing moral superiority on ICE/border? It's not YOUR body/life. Right?
@WIFEofARIENZO @RockyMayra1818 I didn't ask you to apologize. You implied that my moral outrage was invalid and disqualified for some reason while you're entitled to your moral outrage.
@WIFEofARIENZO @RockyMayra1818 So Krysten... Since the 9/11 attacks had no direct 'effect on my life' should that not have concerned me either. So if there's anything on your twitter feed espousing moral or political opinion on a subject that doesn't effect your life PERSONALLY, like say... border situation. .
@WIFEofARIENZO @RockyMayra1818 So you have the moral authority of this issue totally cornered over me since I am of a certain demographic?

@Mholly01 @ashleyb8255 @RockyMayra1818 I understand. But a law of life that will never ever change even in the most Candy-Land utopia is that all actions have consequences.

@Mholly01 @ashleyb8255 @RockyMayra1818 Then i don't know the master you worship and frankly don't care to be introduced. Mine is Jesus Christ and he welcomes ALL into his kingdom which cannot be gained or earned by morals or ethics, but simply by accepting his tender love for you. #He'sAlwaysReady
@Mholly01 @ashleyb8255 @RockyMayra1818 You imply you're faithful...If you're proudly a member of the team trying to ruin and destroy a believer for not baking a cake celebrating sin, the team who has no problem and a long history of calling defenders of innocent life 'misogynistic' for their heartbreak over murder
@Mholly01 @ashleyb8255 @RockyMayra1818 Ethics and Morals? How about  Master Jesus?
@Mholly01 @ashleyb8255 @RockyMayra1818 I also pointed out the hypocrisy of whining about having no control over her sexual choices without a hint of consideration for the baby having zero control over its imminent murder. Understand?  If i could i could speak in Leftist for you i would but i'm past kindergarten.
@Mholly01 @ashleyb8255 @RockyMayra1818 I wondered where the outrage from leftists was when the marxist wackos tried forcing him to bake a cake and then tried to ruin him. Much like the hypothetical woman was 'ruined' in her story.
@Mholly01 @ashleyb8255 @RockyMayra1818 This has to be a liberal, i'll dumb it down. What don't you understand? She was lamenting the alleged coercion in some hypothetical situation where a man forces a woman to have sex therefore justifying and cleaning her hands of abortion. I drew a couple parallels...
@ashleyb8255 @RockyMayra1818 It's the precious little baby's fault and was its choice also...K Got it. Therefore she should not only have no say in her death but since she's worthless and unwanted deserves to be killed. #LiberalismIsPureEVIL
@ashleyb8255 @RockyMayra1818 As your insane marxist friends keep exiting the court, 🇺🇸 will be restored to its roots and all your side can do is throw tantrums b/c you can't suck a baby out of the womb, put a spike in its precious head, burn it with chemicals or suffocate it. Women's 'Rights' though right?
@ashleyb8255 @RockyMayra1818 And LOSE 😂 #PatheticLibs. And that's not anything compared to the hell and torment your side has ZERO problem putting the most innocent and precious of lives through in the womb. Lucky for America you're losing the court!
@ashleyb8255 @RockyMayra1818 That's the way the leftists are. Try to force a Christ Loving Private Business man to bake a cake via coercion of unelected government officials, then try to bankrupt him with $500/day fines, threaten and scare his wife to death, throw rocks through his windows, go to court...
@RockyMayra1818 Why did i weep after 9/11? It 'concerned' me. Why am i disturbed when murder of a precious human life happens in or out of the fetus, because it 'concerns' me. But by your logic, anything that doesn't concern us 'personally' we ought to keep quiet about. So by your logic liberals

@TX_Vet1 @tjoy7 @TheFutureIsEle1 @RyanTAnd The Bible says not to help others in sin! Do you know what sin is? The lake of fire? Is it loving to encourage and help others on there way there? How about politely and respectfully refusing to pave the way. Nope, that's BIGOTRY!
@TX_Vet1 @tjoy7 @TheFutureIsEle1 @RyanTAnd Please don't use profanity. How is that a bad comparison?

@Witchessssss @FAIreland No it's actually disdained by the political left and not nearly promoted enough or as much as homosexuality.
@FAIreland Next match will promote Christianity and Bible right?
@davydublin47 @flying_cabbage @FAIreland What 'rights' do lgbt want?
@flying_cabbage @davydublin47 @FAIreland Why do you have to shove lgbt on me? Why won't you join the effort to get Jesus Christ to be 'widely accepted?' I look forward to the jerseys sporting Crucifixes next month for Christ pride.
@flying_cabbage @FAIreland Imagine feeling so fragile that a private baker refuses to cook a cake celebrating a homosexual marriage that you sue and try to tarnish him to the point of ruin.	#LiberalTolerance  #CoExist
@FAIreland So the next match they'll be wearing Crosses for Christian 'pride' month correct?

@slickwilly82 @LeahVukmir Al-Qaeda provides many free quality services to people in its spheres of control. Maybe this warms your heart to them, but I just can't seem to look past the mass-murdering they kinda have a thing for. I don't see how planned parenthood is one bit different.

@OSWreview Another point where I see Vince/Pat Patt TOTALLY leaving minted corevette on the lot is Sum Slam '90 with Rick Rude! Men HATED Rude. Can you imagine him going over Warrior and swiveling through fed? IMO, so many of these corevettes not driven/misused from 90-92 jay!!😤😩
@OSWreview I'd have kept title on Ric somehow vs Hogan. Maybe savage wins it back at wembley. Soo many options for rest of card over summer like you've highlited. Sid isn't put off by getting Hogan'd, wouldn't have been to point of jadedness when he was passed to Warrior.
@OSWreview I like that. Flair still w company for Caesar's Parking Lot would have reshuffled that card and may have saved it. Hulk Flair house circuit seems rushed/contrived to me, kind of like they just plopped two goliaths without much seasoning/natural build. Seeds needed more watering.

@DavidOH2577 @ABC You have gone too far. War monger??
@DavidOH2577 @ABC Warmonger???? What??
@DavidOH2577 @ABC Pres Trump has accepted this sacrifice. Do you deny His salvation just like mine? "Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed" 	1 peter 2:24	Except for Trump right?

@DavidOH2577 @ABC Let me guess. You're also pro 'choice' Amirite??
@DavidOH2577 @ABC He came to defeat... wait for it... EVIL!! The kind leftists like yourself not only CELEBRATE but try to force us into embracing. Never. Christ loves the sinner but HATES the sin. That is as Real Christian as it gets...
@DavidOH2577 @ABC Christ is not just about love. He is about defeating satan. That was His victory. Christ is about Justice and righteousness.  "When He had received the drink Jesus said 'it is finished' with that He bowed His head and gave up His Spirit" John 19:30.  Satan defeated. Sin defeated.
@DavidOH2577 @ABC And please do tell me how am I embracing teachings of man over The Master? Do you accept and celebrate homo-sexuality? Do you know there is nothing more unloving then letting someone live in sin go to hell, let alone CELEBRATE it?! Please BIBLICALLY explain my error.
@DavidOH2577 @ABC Would Christ who is pure righteousness and love and therefore pure JUSTICE rather watch his precious creation being oppressed in a hell while a perfectly capable nation didn't do it's best to stop it?? Add to that, the perfectly capable nation is a CONSTANT TARGET since 9/11
@DavidOH2577 @ABC Ahh, you're the self anointed real Christian calling me fake yet I'm the pharisee. Point taken. But what does any of that have to do with me Thanking God for using The U.S. and delighting in God's rightous obliteration of evil from planet vs your cringing over it??
@DavidOH2577 @ABC The Untied States does its best to liberate the oppressed and we celebrate it. If that is the grounds on which you're questioning my devotion to Christ, please, bring it on.
@DavidOH2577 @ABC And to your comment on me equating you to supporting taliban...Among flood of comments commending taliban being blown up, yours simply said it was horrifying.  You may not be a supporter of the satanic regime but you seemed appalled by others celebrating as if it was a bad thing.
@DavidOH2577 @ABC You have zero love if you're not at constant war with evil. The only way to be at constant war with evil is to have Christ as your savior. May God have mercy on you for calling me the exact opposite of what I am. My heart is Christ's, purchased at Calvary. I forgive you 4 insults
@DavidOH2577 @ABC America is a flawed but righteous nation. It throttles evil more than any nation.  The attack is beautiful and it is to be celebrated. It is horrifying to the wicked, so I shall rejoice in it.
PLEASE WATCH! https://t.co/hGunS03gSA via @youtube
@DavidOH2577 @ABC Unless you're into the taliban/brutal authoritarianism/child and female slavery/dominance by a few with biggest guns. In that case, then yes, I bet it's horrifying for you. Cheers.
