There’s a reason we don’t need a border wall with Canada and at the U.S.-Canada border we have a “rainbow bridge.”
@AOC Are you sure about that? Really sure?
“The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.”
A border that is not secure isn’t just about national security. It’s also a public health issue.

We can’t lay blame on just the Democrats. We ALL need to come together. It is our responsibility as Americans.
This is not “governance-by-extortion”— at least not on behalf of President Trump. There is almost an entire political party basing their decisions on their hatred of the president and the Republican Party.
The shutdown is simply the result of the polarization of the party system. We need to work TOGETHER for our country— not against each other.
The media has an agenda to be incendiary to those vulnerable to intense passion.
Let’s replace hatred, distrust, and resentment with mutual respect and understanding.
Progress for the United States will come when the left and the right are less polar— hatred is the problem at this point.
