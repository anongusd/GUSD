More from SoftBank's Masayoshi Son on taking more money from the Saudis in the future:		"For the new cases or new projects, we would like to carefully watch the outcome of the case and once the explanation is fully made, then we will think about it once again." https://t.co/bHoFIW8WnA
Masa was asked if he would take money from the Saudis in future Vision Funds. Doesn't directly say.		"We still have money in the Vision Fund one," Son says. "It is still to early to go ahead with Vision Fund two."
Masa on the SoftBank Vision Fund: 		"We are not recklessly just making investments."
Basically, Masa is framing this as: 		Even if you have problems with the Saudi government, we are here looking out for the Saudi people. So we've got to keep investing Saudi money. https://t.co/gbmJukKGvI
Here are the full comments from Masayoshi Son on the killing of Jamal #Khashoggi, SoftBank, and SoftBank's relationship with Saudi Arabia -- his first on the topic.

Masa also insists his $100 billion fund is doing quite well -- it is "even exceeding my track record."		"We don't want to peak out in 30 years. We want to keep growing for 300 years."
Masa Son on the Vision Fund:		"Only history will tell whether our strategy is right or wrong. But I believe that 300 years ahead, people would say that our strategy turned out to be correct and right and there will be some companies or organizations that will copy our strategy."
The Vision and Delta Funds brought SoftBank about $3 billion in income last year.
SoftBank still expects the Vision Fund -- which was originally supposed to close last year -- to close by the end of next month, per new report.
These two SoftBank funds have so far spent $29.7 billion on deals.		When you add in the $13 billion that SoftBank spent on Uber and Didi, that's a total of almost $43 billion that has been already spent on tech companies in the last fiscal year.
This is in addition to a companion fund run by SoftBank, the Delta Fund, a $6 billion vehicle.
