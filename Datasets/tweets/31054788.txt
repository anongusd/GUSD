10) 藉此提醒花媽的是，今年6月，法院已判決高雄市府要負40％責任（榮化、華運各30％），且明確認證氣爆原因的源頭是-「排水箱涵內4吋管線施工有便宜行事的情況」，而當年負責人就是吳宏謀科長。看來"吳宏謀"比"吳音寧"還要走運，花媽真是夠力。
9) 沒有最扯，只有更扯。5個月後，在陳菊力薦下，吳接任行政院政務委員（兼公共工程委員會主委）；2017年11月，就任台灣港務公司董事長（民進黨口中的肥貓缺）；2018年7月，高升為交通部部長，以「官運亨通」來形容，絕不為過。

3) ROC good  Nationalist Government granted railway to this “Lost Humanitarian habitat”. The only safe way to travel was via 自強號 Self Strengthen Line。		Now it is messed up by Taiwan DPP Party.		I can’t take hateful train no more with Taiwanese hardliners who worship Japan.
2) Ten years ago on October 21 a tour bus with PRC Chinese fell off the cliff into the Pacific &amp; no bodies found.	Yes, we fought off Japan invaders, but the agreement for Russia and the USA via Crimea Yalta Treaty is to condemn all KMT Chinese to this wildlife. So revelation...

15) Please Revive R.O.C. and not to be submerged by PRC. It is beneficial to preserve peace on earth. Now, that is a good thing.
14) Now USA must face a rising Communist geopolitical power, so that USA will never forsake your own freedom.
13) Who would assist USA &amp; work hard to obtain human freedom?If you count on Taiwan DPP,  that is FAT CHANCE. So far we haven’t seen DPP demonstrated with any capability just yet.		They would desert America or Taiwan &amp; take Blackhawk to safety.		Good Luck, ROC ‘s big friend USA!
12) Second time in 1979, you recognized PRC as the only China.		Thank you, you have obtained PRC as ally who condemn you as number one enemy.
11） In the process of betraying your ally ROC who had assisted you in fighting off Japan fascism, this time around, USA might lose world leadership.		The first time in 1949, USA deserted your Big Friend ROC to yield China mainland to Communist PRC.

8) New version Mao propaganda machine that appeals to Chinese patriotism + Communism now goes against USA, enemy number 1 for Chinese Communists.		USA annual $500 billion trade deficit only to strengthen PRC.
7) A Russia surrogate PRC who made no contribution to mankind, but occupied China mainland since 1949 horrifies me for humanity conscience.
6) True history won’t forget data. 		Motif		Russia wanted China soil after we defeated Japan imperialist, so PRC was installed in 1949.		My Grandpa et al instrumented works for Dr. Sun Yatsen’s R.O.C. China to defeat Japan invaders.		His works were stolen by Chiang Kaishek &amp; son.
5) Casablanca 		You must remember this...		Humanity survived due to many works from unsung heroes and heroines of Chinese people and Chinese Nationalists.
4) Recognize Real China, Republic of China,  so That democracy peace lighthouse will shine.
3) We urge Americans to wake up from many years of abusive plague rape against underdogs CHINESE NATIONALIST. 		As we are USA true friends to assist in world peace, and Pacific regional calm by sacrificing our sovereignty so to maintain a status quo under one China policy.
2) Majority Taiwanese also control KMT Nationalist Party but their ancestors did not contribute to world peace against Japan militants.		Chinese KMT as Republic of China 🇹🇼 defended China mainland against Japan military.		Taiwanese had no contribution but benefited later.
1） Once DPP took all media from KMT, and all government divisions, they are invincible now. Thus to guarantee downfall of Pacific region. Americans must shed blood against other ideology such as Communism.

3) Those Taiwan compatriots trapped as flood victims on Sept. 4 are less important than 9/5 Taiwan Pindong county officials die hard Independence fans.		The scarce resources all allotted to DPP officials at Sheraton Hotel, Osaka.		Bureau Chief Su committed suicide to say sorry.

3) As Protestants brought English to USA, China Proper dialect followed the path of refugees as they escaped invasion to cross Yangtze River &amp; dispersed in rest China regions. 		For example, they endowed new found land with Heluo language.  Some books written in Suzhou dialect.
2) Soong dynasty’s official spoken language was Yellow River and Luoyang regional dialect. We refer to as Heluo 河洛 or 客家Hakka language.
1) Republic of China 🇹🇼 in ancient time,  like Soong dynasty ( 960-1279 AD), people didn’t speak Mandarin.		Jin tribe Tartar (Qing Dynasty’s ancestors) invaded Northern Soong.		Mongol finished Southern Soong &amp; North Jin tribe.		Chinese have been speaking Mandarin since 1644 AD.

@BillWaters7 In the 60s, there were many operas in Taiwan, Peking opera, Taiwanese, Cantonese etc. Soong dynasty communicated like Taiwanese opera called Kejia or Hakka.	Taiwanese vs Mandarin, in fact,Taiwanese dialect originated from Yellow river &amp; China Proper Luoyang. All operas flourished
@BillWaters7 Taiwan dialect is only 1 type. English is the official language in school. Correct? Spoken language is Mandarin which passed down by Qing Tartar as that was to communicate in court to the emperor. Written language only one type. Chinese sustains as opposed to extinct Indian.

7) We are descendants of refugees who came from mainland China in 1949. If we had stayed we would’ve been persecuted. If Judge Kavanaugh can hear Chinese minority plea in Taiwan, this world will be a better place to deserve human dignity for we can have a fair chance to subsist.
6) Due to foreign policy, geopolitical importance to counter communist China, we have become underdogs in Taiwan.
5) We don’t have original sin as Taiwan majority think. They think we don’t deserve to survive in Taiwan. We are prejudged. Taiwan majority acts to dehumanize minority rights to live as equal citizens.
4) Task 3. Do not be misguided by Taiwanese fake independence. Much like Mayflower Protestants came to USA. Chinese Mainlanders came to Taiwan as refugees because we were sold by Yalta Treaty without ROC presence by violating her sovereignty.
3)Tartar Qing dynasty law ( 1644-1911 AD ): If you keep your hair, you lose your head. You must have the queue pig tail. When ROC national father Dr. Sun Yatsen came to San Francisco, he immediately cut the queue off.
2)Task 2. I learned this from my Asian American law professor in UC Berkeley about 1889 Chinese Exclusion Act. When Chinese escaped to USA, many times as slaves caught in containers.	Equal rights don’t apply in some areas in the USA such as medical treatment.
1) Judge Kavanaugh’s three historic tasks  for America.	Task 1.  To rescind 1979 decision under President Carter to make a Constitutional Republic of China into non profit organization by violating our inalienable rights as a ROC true China citizen.

4) So that the first Democratic Republic nation was born in Asia on January 1st, 1912 by the western calendar.		Her name is 🇹🇼 Republic of China.		Dr. Sun Yet-sen set free entire 99% Chinese Han race from marginal brutal regime Qing Tartar.
3) During Soong dynasty Chinese Han race also fought against these brutal ethnic Jin tribe.		In fact, original Chinese migrated from China Proper to south.		Hakka means Yellow River Luoyang region.		Dr. Sun Yat-sen is a Hakka Chinese with very correct original Chinese identity.
2) Chinese were suppressed from China mainland by Manchurians ( Jin Tribe) in Qing dynasty (1644-1911) for 268 years.

6)Same as Taiwan DPP terrorists ideologue. They sentence you are in the wrong or have that original sin when Thomas Jefferson said: Man are all born equal.		If you are not rigidly defined Taiwanese, you deserve to die.

4) While you are using Taiwan DPP hate toward Chinese, be it Nationalist or Communist, a reminder to you, for humanitarian reason, don’t forget there are millions of underdogs at your mercy. In China mainland, or on Taiwan island, they wish they can have a better life.
3)	Millennium born in PRC have a great chance as they were not overpowered by Mao ideology which is always to get the better of England and USA. Yes, still with Boxer Rebellion hate toward the Western value.
2)	Neither FDR nor Winston Churchill could have stopped the advancement of communist conquest of the world. In fact, Churchill foresaw it coming.
1) It is really not Trump policy but his predecessors who have emboldened the Communist PRC and Taiwan extremist mobster DPP.		The number one mistake made was your foreign policy to desert ROC and caved in to Russian pal PRC in 1949.		 https://t.co/9U2fKojWky

When advance communism for China,  USA freedom will suffer. No Republic of China 🇹🇼 will help you. As you endorse Taiwan reactionary DPP who have accomplished nothing, but only instigate ethnic hate against minority Chinese.	Thus, Taiwan hardliners can sustain &amp; rob ROC.
Apple CEO Tim Cook in Communist version of China PRC said:	We embrace openness.		Yes. But you can’t sell top secrets Apple CPU to China. No other country or corporation in the world will be open about CPU design.
Due to American policy to suppress free Republic of China, now your communist version of China is challenging you. 		USA must be equipped to defend your own free ideology.	Solo or by world alliance but at your own doing.	At behest of American people who truly are anti communist.
Mao ideology like Boxer rebellion bullies the world, now PRC wants hegemony.		A remarkable USA President Teddy Roosevelt who was sympathetic with China and turned Boxer Rebellion war redemption into scholarship. This bought peace time for the world like ROC China advanced peace.
The world is forgetful. Should USA fight for freedom?		Once upon a time, alien Siberian controlled China. Tartar Qing Emperor Kanxi took all scientific astronomy equipments from Ming dynasty Nanjing to Beijing.	I was In Nanjing, @secret place, I could feel the calling of science!
So yes, 🇹🇼 Republic of China education and transportation minister Nationalist Dr. ChiaHua Chu were the one that made China back to world map with science. Not the Communist Mao.
You would ask Berlin University Ph.D. in geology, Dr. ChiaHua Chu 朱家驊地質家 who was in charge of Sinica Academie 中央研究院。	He gave Dr. Zhao $200,000 to purchase scientific equipments.	1949, when Communist took over, these equipments went to China mainland.
But how did they get the U.S.A. equipments to develop nuclear technology?		Where did nuclear research equipments $200,000 come from?

4) Why USA only remembers the Russian Moscow trained KMT, Chiang Kaishek’s son, Chiang Jingguo who polluted ROC with dogmatic training by combining intelligence networks into a spartan state?
3) America has forgotten your ally the true ROC KMT faction who did the whole world with great contributions for liberty. A model figure is my young Grandfather in his early start to fight for China’s dignity. His lifelong works for China to be equal to world democracy standards.
2) American foreign policy has subjected ROC people and our real government into obscurity.		You have swapped away and yielded China Identity by defining as Communist China PRC. 		You have illegally made a Constitutional China ROC into a nonprofit organization by David Dean.
1) Democracy must apply to all nations. Neither communism nor so called Taiwan DPP Democratic Progressive Party is better than any party like KMT.
