#BlackHistoryMonth is about honoring those who have fought for equality before us, and joining with them to fight for equality now. https://t.co/eYYDFYh6Na
"The bill provides a powerful and timely incentive to enroll: if an uninsured tax filer agrees to obtain insurance, their insurance responsibility payment is waived." @standorn spoke today at the Maryland General Assembly. Read about the bill here: https://t.co/mX2tw0hWbF
Let us not forget that the best way to celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth is to fight for equity in all the ways that we can. https://t.co/0wSUVq3EM5
For #BlackHistoryMonth we cannot just honor and learn from those who have fought for equity in our health care system. We have to join with them in making our country better able to serve its people and their needs. https://t.co/kVIxUHPZj7

While the #RxHearing is a good first step in acknowledging drug pricing as a systemic problem, we’re excited to see what next steps will look like from Congress to take action on this pervasive consumer problem.
Learn about why @bmsnews had increased prices for two of their drugs 81 times between 2015 and 2019 when their CEO speaks today in front of the Senate Finance Committee at the #RxHearing. Watch here: https://t.co/yzHIaCEGjD
The former @pfizer CEO called raising prices on 41 drugs “business as normal.” Is it normal when 19% of insured people and 35% of uninsured people are not filling prescriptions because of cost? Hear more at the #RxHearing: https://t.co/yzHIaCEGjD
We hope the #RxHearing is a sign that Congress is finally willing to tackle rampant drug pricing increases as a systemic problem throughout the whole industry and not just a few bad apples like the #PharmaBro
@pfizer applied for 118 patents and raised prices 163% since 2012 on their drug Lyrica, all while many American families are worried about how they can afford their medication. #RxHearing
@AbbVie’s drug Humira is the best-selling drug in the world but prices have gone up 18% each year between 2012 and 2016. Today, we’ll be hearing from their CEO at the Senate Finance Committee’s #RxHearing
@Sanofi has raised the price of their diabetes medication, Lantus, 114% since 2012. Hear what their CEO has to say for these unconscionable price increases at today’s #RxHearing going on now: https://t.co/yzHIaCEGjD
For too long, prescription drug companies have abused federal laws, like patents, to raise their prices to unconscionable levels. The #RxHearing is a first step in facing this issue as a systemic problem only solvable by Congress and the administration. https://t.co/yzHIaCEGjD
@JNJCares has 123 patents on Remicade, an arthritis medication, blocking competition that would lower costs. Congress should keep drug companies accountable at the #RxHearing today.

No one expects that Trump will sign a bill for single payer. So the question is, how do Democrats set themselves up for a 2020 Presidential candidate to run with it going forward? @sgremminger
The first big bill in this congress we need to think about is the debt ceiling. And there are a series of health care extenders that need to be taken care of throughout 2019---including Medicaid in Puerto Rico and community health centers. @sgremminger
We have every reason to believe that states will uphold their new mandate to expand Medicaid to their constituents. @SophiaTripoli
For Utah, Idaho, and Nebraska, each state must submit a state plan amendment walking through how they will implement the Medicaid expansion by the deadline in the ballot. @SophiaTripoli
Two years ago it seemed certain that the ACA would be repealed, put yourself back in that frame of mind. Why didn't it happen? Facts won. Values of fairness and protection prevailed. And health care is fundamentally about economics. @ASlavitt
2019 will be busy! Every state will be a focus of a new opportunity to prevent, expand, or increase people's access to care. These are important efforts to fight against disparities. @ASlavitt
Remember, in 2008, no one had protections for preexisting conditions. It wasn't until the people had a chance to see those fundamental protections come to life that we began to see how much they meant to the public. @ASlavitt
Medicaid enjoys solid bipartisan support----from people who identify as Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. @ASlavitt
Post-2016 election 72% of individuals polled said that protecting people with preexisting conditions was a top issue. The GOP realized late in the game just how important the issue is. We need to continue to hold members accountable to their promises. @geoffgarin

#HealthEquity will be achieved when the voices of all communities, especially those struggling with inequities, are included in shaping our health care system, and the distribution of health risk and opportunity across the entire nation. #APHAHealthEquity
Structural racism creates unequal health risk &amp; opportunity. #APHAHealthEquity
Residential segregation undermines #HealthEquity #Black poverty is more concentrated than white poverty, poor Black kids face a lot more health risk &amp; less health opportunity than poor white kids, who are more likely to live in a better resourced neighborhood. #APHAHealthEquity
#maternalmortality is a critical #HealthEquity issue, especially among African-American &amp; American Indian woman, caused by the physical effects of facing racism, bias in medical care, lower health opportunity/higher health risk &amp; lack of access to quality care. #APHAHealthEquity
Racism &amp; discrimination drive inequity.  Experiencing interpersonal racism produces toxic stress that directly affects health. Institutional racism &amp; bias in health care leads to lower quality care.  #HealthEquity #APHAHealthEquity
#HealthEquity is not just about #healthcare, it’s even more about #socialdeterminants. Where you live, work, play, and pray shape your health risk and health opportunity.  Some communities struggle with disproportionate risk and limited opportunity. #APHAHealthEquity
To achieve #HealthEquity we must fix the health disparities double whammy: Communities of color more likely to get a bunch of diseases, and the outcomes, including mortality are much worse. #APHAHealthEquity

If parents are sick, how can they care for their kids? Adults need #oralhealth coverage too. We need to ensure that all states cover oral health care for adults in their #Medicaid programs, so that parents and pregnant people can get the #oralhealthmagic they need too.
Kids with poor oral health are nearly 3x more likely to miss school and about 4x more likely to earn below-average grades. #Oralhealthmagic means kids are eating, sleeping, and learning. We have to break down barriers to work towards #oralhealth equity! https://t.co/k6szpS2SzR
What does it take to create #oralhealthmagic for kids? It's not just the tooth fairy, it's important programs like #Medicaid and #CHIP that ensure healthy mouths and healthy kids. Click here to learn more: https://t.co/TGusvQxVK7 https://t.co/r0JgyIMseF

Consumers can also speak out and share their stories with us! Through our program, consumer voices are elevated in the policymaking arena. https://t.co/91dEiIhZNw
Consumers can advocate for themselves in the doctor’s office by always asking, “What does this prescription do?” “Are there alternatives?” “Is this the best option based on price and effectiveness?” “Will it be covered by my insurance?” etc.
To get involved, consumers can also engage with local consumer health groups or community-based organizations tackling these issues - If your community has a health care coalition, ask about becoming a consumer representative!
Consumers should find out if their local reps are hosting town halls. It’s a chance for consumers to share that (1) coverage through Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP, etc. has been instrumental and 2) affordability is an issue that impacts much of their lives
For example, this year Maryland became the 1st state to enact a law that protects consumers from #pricegouging and now they are taking next steps to push for a drug pricing transparency bill @HealthyMaryland https://t.co/Boao1ZR7Em
We can help individuals (1) understand what makes health care unaffordable, (2) engage in proposed solutions, and (3) take action on health care affordability issues #AffordHC18 https://t.co/6YkNArwp1D
We have to ensure that Policymakers hear directly from consumers – they need to hear that consumers do end up having to choose between basic necessities when the price of health care is too high! #AffordHC18
3 in 10 Americans report problems paying medical bills - among them, 7 in 10 report cutting back spending on food, clothing, or basic household items. This is a real dilemma for many Americans! https://t.co/3ZbvIrXJPE https://t.co/SILpO6zcJq
