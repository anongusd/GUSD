Democrats are in denial about what’s really going on in the world. They really believe global warming is Trump’s fault, Obama made economy strong, no one has benefited from lower taxes, the green deal will save humanity, government should control our diet and Hillary didn’t lose.
In spite of extreme, unrealistic, ridiculous insanity of democrat plans for free health care, higher taxes, utopian environment, weak national security, unrestricted immigration, socialist economy, liberal education, I haven’t met one single democrat who questions their validity.
All @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @GOP should do everything possible to protest and prevent this democrat abuse of power, instead of just accepting it. Is the GOP dead? They seem so passive, incapable and incompetent. FRUSTRATING! https://t.co/5937fjeJTX
The US Constitution already limits government intrusion on our freedom of expression, press, travel, religion, political affiliation and recognizes our right to possess arms. SOCIALISM GIVES GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY TO TAKE ALL OUR FREEDOMS AWAY so they don’t threaten their agenda. https://t.co/RVChbq67ph
Really unfortunate, but SOCIALISM to the average person means simply better pay, more benefits, and less crime. They don’t know it results in government control, higher taxes, rationing, travel restrictions, a police state, political intimidation, repression and lack of freedoms. https://t.co/7egujg9drp

@JoanneBarnes2 @yeshua_porvida Not everything we do has to be specified in the Bible. What was God’s purpose for the Bible? Is it all inclusive? Must worship be the same for everyone?

Isn’t purpose of Lent to bring  Believers closer to Jesus by memorializing His life, suffering, death and resurrection? It should serve as a witness to those that don’t know Jesus, on why we follow the living Christ and why we wait expectantly for His return. Lent is the Gospel. https://t.co/wBtYqwMd1l

What I am saying is, don’t be offended. Regardless of how women dress, men are going to look at them. In fact, more women will give another woman the once, twice and multiple intense stares than men. But men should be respectful of both the woman and whomever she is with. Guilty?
Do you suppose that has much to do with a culture that promotes sexuality from elementary school, to TV, movies, advertising, news, and the home?

With respect to Health Care, people don’t understand or care about Single Payer Systems. That’s @GOP gobbledygook to most.

I agree. But is @GOP UNDERESTIMATING IMPACT of Full Medical Coverage on people’s vote? Instead of focusing on a government run Single Payer system, how about reforming regulations to allow for real competition and NO Deductible / Out-Of-Pocket Full Coverage? @POTUS was on track. https://t.co/dl6ZXItxa2
Full Medical Coverage is a discussion to be had. @POTUS tried, but neither @DNC nor @GOP cooperated. Myth is Full Coverage would lead to abuse, which is reason for deductibles and limitations.

The time for a woman to be President of the US will come, when the right woman arises to lead the Nation. But she will need more than a banner that reads, “I am woman”. There is no gender in Politics. And everyone fights for position equally.
Now that there are more women competing in politics, they are going to want to use the gender card to gain favor. But there is no gender in politics. There is no privilege. There is no courtesy. When you’re in the soup, you’re in the pot. And everyone fights for position equally.

In 2017 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump asked Congress to come up with a viable Health Care Plan. While improvements were made, more changes are necessary. But many refused to change the old system. Is SP a viable solution? What else should be considered in an SP system? Pros and Cons?
Arguments against Single Payer are: Reduces competition, quality of service, raises costs, increases wait times and Premiums (Tax). But that depends on what Plan covers (structure). Advantage could be no deductibles and no patient billing involvement. Biggest detractor is Cost.
In most countries Single Payer (SP) Systems are supplemented with Private Insurance. Instead of paying insurance premiums, workers pay a Federal Tax. SP claims Costs are offset by reduced administrative costs, price control on services and Rx.  Cost depends on coverage structure. https://t.co/Xivdimr6Fy

I don’t know if there is any theological basis for stating that Christ inhabited an empty body after it was formed. So, I would agree with you.
1Cor 15:50f outlines the purpose of the incarnation. In John 17:5 Christ prays, “And now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world began.” That is, before He became a person of flesh.
It should also be noted that while Christ developed in the womb as a human being, He preexisted with God and as God.  God became flesh to eradicate and prevent corruption from infecting the things He would create after this existance and so bring perfection into creation Dan9:24.
The Spirit of God developed and grew into a fleshly human being from inception. The passage should not be interpreted as: a body was formed in Mary’s womb, then the Spirit of God inhabited it. What passage emphasizes is that an already existing God, became the person of Christ.
Interesting take on Heb10:5. I see the conflict you identify. As far as I am concerned, God became a man in Christ from the moment of fertilization, from conception. But the idea is that God’s Plan was conceived before the begining of space/time 2Tim 1:9. https://t.co/ZWtLMnLwEN
How should Christians handle violent, life threatening confrontations? We’re taught to be passive and accept people burning churches, violent persecution, physical confrontations, boisterous humiliation, name calling, assault. Must we change our way of thinking to respond wisely?
One way Christians can fight is by setting up physical and behavioral barriers to prevent harmful intrusion. Another may include organizing and preparing through training to handle aggressive physical confrontations. Don’t just stand there. Do something not necessarily violent.
Christians live in two conflicting worlds. The 1st driven by morality, the secular by a need to survive. Rules differ and Followers of Christ should know when and how to apply which to each. You don’t have to accept or tolerate persecution. Christ avoided it and also fought back.

I was using a job as an example of why you do good deeds. We are saved by grace, not by works, so that no one can say they are better. See Romans 9:11, Eph 2:9. https://t.co/4ASjW2IePB
Good point. You don’t work to get a job. You work because you have one. Our work demonstrates we have a job, that we’re saved.

That is a nice thought, but that was not how God worked to give us the book we call The Bible.  Peter, Paul and others wote letters to different people. There was no New Testament for 300 years after Christ died. God used the Catholic Church to put the New Testament together. https://t.co/a77chxeA89
But when Catholics set up altars for figurines or statues of saints and virgins, and ascribe powers to them, light candles, kneel before them, pray to them and venerate them, I reach conclusions about what they are doing. Isn’t Replacing Jesus with anyone else idolatry? https://t.co/PKxO5ckm7d
I think it is a matter of common sense and practical life choices, not a Biblical mandate. Now, abortion is a different matter. Procreation was necessary for Christ to enter creation Heb 10:5.

What I am saying is that we might all be Christians, but we are different because God and Christ and the Holy Spirit deemed it wise to have diversity in the Body of believers with respect to doctrine. So we have Catholics, Orthodox, Protestants, Baptists, CofC, and even more. https://t.co/0Ig1hLBEUa
At exactly the same time Columbus set foot in America, Catholic Priest Martin Luther found himself in the middle of a controversy that lead to the Protestant Reformation, over debate on salvation by faith, sola scriptura and other issues. The doctrine of Free Will is Catholic. https://t.co/FMMjdw7wEL
There weren’t many churches back in 325 AD, when the Catholic Church put our Bible together. Catholic Priests compiled what they could of the writings available to them, selected the most reliable and trustworthy and came up with what we now call The New Testament. https://t.co/29w9FLkmrs
@angela_mavromat flexibility means you believe salvation is through faith and not of works. But is the Church of Christ putting an extra burden on Christians by demanding they work for their salvation? Do you know who God made that clear to us through? Martin Luther, a Protestant https://t.co/6bXZqQRuQ8
I believe Christ was Jewish. And he did not start the Church of Christ, which is just another denomination that doesn’t want to be called that. Do you know where the doctrine, the teaching of the Trinity comes from? https://t.co/29w9FLkmrs

But Angela, you sound just like the Pope, telling everyone what they must believe. Were you or anyone in your group appointed Pope? If not, and as a member I disagree with something an Elder or preacher says, whose right? You both read same Bible. Are you or your Elder right? https://t.co/eEl4oQJa4B
The interesting thing is that your Christian beliefs were shaped by the Catholic Church and the Reformation that lead to Protestantism. God has purposely given us diversity in the Body of Christ. Not evryone is a toe. Some are fingers. But we all proclaim a Risen savior, Jesus. https://t.co/NbWSMFKkNg
Shouldn’t Christians have enough flexibility to allow for differences within the body of Christ? A lack of understanding leads to legalistic thinking and forces strict adherance to what others say God says. The Bible is not clear on many issues. Even Jesus told us to be tolerant. https://t.co/EikTvlscWX
But aren’t those structural and functional idiosyncrasies that don’t really affect our faith in Christ and understanding that there is salvation in none other? Nothing wrong with a Pope or confession to Priests. We do same in a more informal way with Pastors and Heads of Church. https://t.co/GdkVFeLbwE

Baptism is a seal of entry into family of God in Christ Col 2. But not everone agrees. Many believe it is only a conscious commitment after a certain age. See Rom 9 and Heb 9.
Some Christians might not be aware that our doctrinal foundation is Roman Catholic. But the differences for Protestants are Scriptural. Intercession by saints, ascension of Mary, Papal authority are points of contention. Infant baptism is based on Rom 4 and Col 2, among others. https://t.co/cVbX9wZo1h
Scripture provides guidance on some things. Tradition may include baptism by immersion or of children, praying to saints and virgins for intercession, having the Lord’s Supper once a month, the liturgy, singing hymns before the sermon, Sunday School, etc, Some are good, some not.
There are specific passages in Scripture that address your points. According to Paul in 2Tim 3:16, Scripture is God breathed. Rom 10:9 says if you declare with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you shall be saved. That complements John 3 on being born again of the spirit. https://t.co/D97s40KBKX

I think you need to rethink this one. What was observed before it was named? https://t.co/0Wr3eSAOWk
The question now becomes, observed by whom? You, me, anyone? If you see it but I don’t, does that make it false or non-existent? https://t.co/0vvLpX9N9k
@Jim1810 So there was no far side of the moon until the far side was observed?
And that is the point, isn’t it? Structure. And you can’t have structure without mind. Keep in mind, the universe existed before we did. And there were circles and triangles before there were human minds in existence. https://t.co/A6N9ZcHWDR
Who’s we? But I am not assuming. I am trying to make a point. Mathematical relationships between objects ecist with or without our human existence. Triangles, squares and circles don’t need our understanding to exist empirically or logically. https://t.co/pdzCPbdaoV
What’s this thing we call consciousness and how does it come about in some material things and not others? Are atoms, for example, conscious entities? Are the elements? It can’t be result of mere chemical processes, right? Is wine, for example, conscious? Aware of its existence? https://t.co/GBUg11BPtJ
@Jim1810 Thank you. So, before we existed, mind existed, given that mathematical relationships and order existed before us in matter? So, as you say, that presuposses mind. But your mind is finite. Is there mind apart from matter? Is mind an independent entity that attaches to matter?
One photon can be an accident. But two is evidence of purpose, intent, organization. And how do photons multiply? Do they exist on their own or as part of something else? That is, are they dependent entities?
Or is order arbitrary for one thing and not for another? My question is, how is that standard set? If I recall, matter is made up of atoms. And atoms are highly regulated, well calibrated composites. How does that happen? Accident? No. For one, yes. For two, no. https://t.co/FzQ7vNAM1T
So you are saying that matter, by definition, has to be orderly? It is a necessary condition of matter to be orderly? So you agree that order is a compelling force for existence? https://t.co/PAECZ6F0oE
So if mathematical relationships and logic determine the composition and behavior of matter, is there mind in a pre-material existence? That is, we exist as humans after matter, not before it. https://t.co/PxP0qRLrbd
Are you saying mathematical relations and logic don’t exist apart from mind? https://t.co/efBX2GiBLQ
So they say! Can you define energy? Or organic? Or how you transition from organic to consciousness? Is everything material? Or energy? https://t.co/qepueU3EhM
What we know is, there’re factors that determine how things must behave, right? Logic, mathematics, reason are standards, right? How are those standards set in prematerial existence? That is, if matter can’t exist without order, how does that order come about for matter to exist? https://t.co/zktLjGOdoV
So, there is a standard, a ruler all things are guided by and adhere to. Existence is not arbitrary, haphazard, or lawless. How does that standard we call laws of nature come about? If there is no god, there is a standard and by definition, doesn’t that standard become a god? https://t.co/GKNeluJevE

The consistent reliability of the effects of gravity is the point. Where does that constant come from? I’m not asking about the definition of gravity. I am asking about origins. What determines that things function a certain way or adhere to specific behaviors? https://t.co/lINCD4fGyM
How does warped space produce life? https://t.co/yie4DRX2X4
Now you are venturing beyond my limits into the unknown. How does space-time come into existence and how does mass produce organic matter? Doesn’t there have to be a process, that is, a standard? https://t.co/yie4DRX2X4
Where does existence come from? How does it originate? What was its beginning? https://t.co/3OoWGJjtuD
So you are saying the universe is not regulated or that it doesn’t function in keeping with certain, specific norms that are not only observable, but trustworthy? https://t.co/mKdPwGF1is
Exactly! https://t.co/lINCD4fGyM
That’s an unsubstantiated assumption. Gravity, for example, controls or determines if an object that goes up, comes back down. https://t.co/vYpnaiy3s2
That observable behavior is what, in part, leads us to conclude that all things are regulated. https://t.co/LN0Rh1BEsf
If existence were just existence, our conversation wouldn’t have any meaning and wouldn’t make sense. The fact that things make sense means there is more to existence than just being. https://t.co/1glWVbJ3gM
I have to disagree. Causality is not merely descriptive. It has to do with order, relationship and consistency. A plane flies, not because we observe it fly, but because it was designed to adhere to certain physical laws that allow it to soar through the air. https://t.co/FrNlrJ0Viv
The question is not wheter you bilieve in some god. It is whether some god is behind what exists. If matter and non-matter exist, what or which determines the laws of existence? What is the basis for these laws? They can’t just be arbitrary. https://t.co/AgsCVO6wzq
The fact that something exists, more particularly in an orderly universe subject to physical laws, reason and consciousness, is an argument for the validity of cause and effect. So, what cause resulted in the effect of an orderly existence? Accident can’t explain existence. https://t.co/T0kLqOOfoW

I see your point. But, I wouldn’t take Luke 17 or Matt 24 too literally. Jesus is explaining things through metaphor and idioms, like when He says, “the dog returns to his vomit”, to help us visualize it. Those raptured will have no need to witness a slaughter to know it’s Jesus. https://t.co/RlUbEWSDQr
Verse 29 is explicit that the Second Coming and Rapture are immediately after the Tribulation. This is the only place in all of the Bible where Jesus or anyone else specifies a time. https://t.co/0LyCgHdA9L

See the progression? First there is a panoramic view of history and the Tribulation. Then it narrows the focus on the last moment. Finally, the camera zooms in on the final hour. There is some back and forth, but the lens is constantly zooming in on the last hour called “Wrath”.
The Trumpets narrow down to the final moments of the 7th Seal of the Tribulation. Then the Bowls of God’s Wrath are poured at the final hour of the 7th or last Trumpet. It is that final hour of wrath that Christians are spared from, as they are taken up to join Christ in the air.
There appears to be a difference between the Day of the Lord and the Day of Wrath in Revelation. The first described a prolonged 7 year ordeal. The latter a final event at the very end of the 7 year period. The Seals start with a macro view of the Tribulation period... https://t.co/m0qOJeceW4

As soon as @realDonaldTrump became @POTUS the Fed raised interest rates and promised more increases. A thriving super market, suddenly stopped short of 30K and started declining. Like the blind man, I only know that when rates went up, everything went bust. All else is secondary.
Let me clarify. What restrains appearance of the Antichrist, coming of Christ and Rapture is the Apostasy. That comes first. Apostasy is a religious and theological, not a secular issue. Apostasy is departure from Truth. A confused, apostate religious setting invites Antichrist. https://t.co/aYlQhkaGNO

The Bible is true forever. Without the Holy Spirit to convict us of sin, give us new life and bring us to Jesus, we could never know the Truth, believe in Jesus, and be saved now or through the “Tribulation”. Remember, the Holy Spirit is the Seal of our new birth. That’s my take.
Examine 2Thess2:10-12. The Truth is what restrains. And God will send them delusion so they will believe a lie. What is the message of the Church? It is that Jesus is Truth. But what is the message of Apostasy? Humanism. And Jesus doesn’t figure in ideological Humanism.
There’s an ascendancy of evil as the moral influence of the Church declines through its Apostasy. That is, immorality and evil increase as morality decreases. It’s the moral fabric of the Church that restrains the full magnification of corruption as personified in the Antichrist.
Then, 3-The Day of The Lord. If you follow the pattern, the passage becomes clearer. Paul never says the Holy Spirit is removed. That’s a doctrinal misconception not Biblical fact. So what is it that holds the Antichrist and Apostasy back? It’s the Moral influence of the Church..
Good question! My take: there are several things to focus on in 2Thes2. NO RAPTURE UNTIL: 1-Apostasy 2-Antichrist Sits in Jerusalem Temple 31/2 yrs after ascendancy, meaning there is a timeline and someone or something making sure (restraining or holding it back) it is on track.. https://t.co/GABAzu0Xuz

IMO Christians must not police or regulate behavior of others. We encourage others to behave in a morally upright way, but too many Pastors think it’s their duty to control the personal lives of others through guilt, threats of losing salvation and being rejected by the Father.

Neither perfection nor sinlessness are qualities I possess. I sin daily whether by word or deed. I need forgiveness hourly. IMO Christians will do better if they stay out of people’s personal and intimate lives. I think we were called to tell people about Christ, not morality. https://t.co/EskpePGa1Y
Yes, the Bible tells us there are many sins and thanks to Christ the incarnate God, there will be no sin or corruption in Heaven. But I won’t be the one to cast stones. I will, however, speak againt those that betray the name of Christ with idolatry and false doctrines of wealth. https://t.co/n3KjCxYFGc
Perhaps Christians shouldn’t be so focused on sins instead of people. If Christ died for Gay people and receives them and fills them, who are we to point our dirty fingers at them for their human condition or sin?

I respectfully disagree. That small margin shows how hard they fought for their mandate to Resist, Obstruct, Delay and make @POTUS fail. One vote would have been enough to give them the victory. They are now in control of Congress and we are not. Tough fights ahead. https://t.co/Aj2wgjVTAh

I used to feel bad in church when I was young because, I didn’t have a “testimony” of “deliverance”. That God called me and revealed Himself to me in a vision, where I became aware of His presence and Jesus with Him on the throne, wasn’t enough. BUT IT WAS! Christ met me in NYC. https://t.co/jcZWesYTT6
We’re the spiritual army of God. We fight a spiritual battle with spiritual weapons, like doing good. Gal3:14, 1Pet3:9, 2Cor10:3-5, Eph6:10-12. We’re called to accomplish God’s Purpose. That’s why there is so much denominational diversity in the Church. Each has a different task. https://t.co/e7ZgOdBO02
Soldiers are called to serve. But in the process, they’re cleaned up, fed, trained and sent to battle, where they may be injured. The objective is not to feed or give  them a better life, it’s to equip them for war. So we are delivered from sinful ignorance to prepare us for war. https://t.co/YW9j8cKHgT
Opinion: Although many are delivered from things like addictions, we are all “conscripted” to carry out God’s Plan for creation. Deliverance is an added benefit. What, for example, were Andrew, James, Peter, John delivered from other than perdition? See my point.... https://t.co/cwMupYSDuP
There was no @DNC blue wave, but @GOP dragged into deep blue sea by @DNC Riptide in the House 219 to 193. Did people vote to paralyze government, reverse strong economy, scrap Wall, allow open borders, end Tariff war, pro Iran, global warming, anti-Israel, anti @POTUS? Sadly, Yes
@RealSaavedra don’t overlook the fact that she won with 80%. Never mind, @Ocasio2018. What does that say about the direction, sentiments and interest of voters? Alexandria might be what she is, but that is inconsecuential. What matters is that she is a vote against @POTUS. Sad! https://t.co/0M6UJWvUHb

Confusion stems from earliest manuscript which is Coptic and seems to say The Word was "a god". But that interpretation is contrary to what John1 conveys, making interpretation of article "a", as one in many, doubtful. Prov8 is also stretched by calling Jesus 1st act of creation. https://t.co/vU6GLtQwbd

Misconception is God created man to enjoy His blessings. Jesus is an afterthought to correct what went wrong. But Jesus comes 1st. Ford didn't create the car so he could paint and wax it. His Plan was transportation. God created mankind so Jesus could bring perfection Dan 9:24b. https://t.co/E7YharlmyQ
@SSahlholdt @yeshua_porvida Problem with Col1:15 for many like JW, is they interpret "firstborn" as created. Instead, the thought is that Jesus as Redeemer is what creation is ALL about, vs 16. God created this material and spiritual existence for Christ to conquer corruption and bring perfection (Heb10:5).
Common JW fallacy. Starting with John8:58 Before Abramam, I am. John1:1 tells us Jesus is God. Col1:15 says ALL things were created by Jesus and FOR Him. In Rev1 Jesus is the Alpha and Omega. https://t.co/MZW06oL2Uu

Let me put that in perspective. God didn't come as Jesus to throw you in the Septic Tank. He died to get you out of it. But because you thought you looked beautiful in it, you refused His help. So now you will continue to be deep in wet, slimy feces no matter how pretty you look. https://t.co/kisxumgnLF
For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.
You look great. But you are going about it the wrong way. Jesus isn't looking for good looking people, He is calling sinners to repentance. For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. https://t.co/Ml6UFtOHKm

Hooray for @senatemajldr McConnell for standing up with power and courage against Democrat assaults. Get off the ropes and start punching. This is a bare knuckles street fight, not a Democrat invitation to civil discourse. https://t.co/NdXEKwte3O
@SenSchumer eloquent Sophistry in response to @senatemajldr McConnell is true to the name. Deceptive, misleading and full of false allegations. What an accomplished Liar! He believes Ford on her say so, but denies Kavanaugh the same courtesy. https://t.co/2Ypl9KgH6K
@SenSchumer said @SenateDems not in control and didn't call for 1 week delay which called by undecided @SenateGOP. Then he endorsed 1 week and only 1 week delay. But if Democrats didn't call for delay for FBI to satisfy GOP concerns why interest in what FBI  WH instructions were?
Time for @HouseGOP @SenateGOP to take off the kid gloves and go bare knuckles with Democrats. CONFIRM Kavanaugh without further delay and include funds to BUILD THE WALL in the Budget.

Interesting report. Didn't Ford testify she spoke to Wapo because they approached her, from many other reporters outside her residence, as result release of letter she gave Feinstein? But Wapo interview was prior to July 6 and her letter to Feinstein was July 30. I am confused. https://t.co/xEntftqrlD

The density of the ultra-liberal Democrat mind transcends that of a black hole. Witnesses say "They have no memory of party, place, time, meeting Kavanaugh, assault or being told of attack, but it's true if Ford says so." We should ask Ford about Unicorns and solve that mystery.

I'm not convinced Term Limits are answer to ineffective government.

@GOP talking points are inconsequential @charliekirk11. The issue is winning. Now that @GOP lost @JeffFlake and he feels empowered by Democrats, the Committee doesn't have the votes.

@GOP @POTUS haven't been fighting back. They are just standing in the elevator and taking it. Don"t know why they haven't identified Democrat weak links and twisted their arms. Corey leaks, Feinstein leaks and withholds evidence, Kamala calls for assaults and @ChuckGrassley runs. https://t.co/bj9YpmRwm9
Right now, one dissenting vote on the Republican side means Kavanaugh won't be considered for a full vote. @ChuckGrassley only has 10 votes, if that. Democrats on the Judicial Committee have at least 11. Chuck blew it by delaying the vote. Nothing can bring Flake back. https://t.co/n48HwSzPSV

It is a figure of speech, not a legal definition. But by any definition, the incident Ford describes might not meet the legal definition of rape either, as traumatic and reprehensible as it might have been. And I know men and women that were victims of rape, a horrible thing. https://t.co/5jVknTzzE0
Sorry @HeatherPeracchi but rape doesn't always have to be by a man. And it is not exclusive to women. Rape is characterized by violence, force and absence of consent.

Devastating as delay to confirm Kavanaugh seems, we have to remember that God is in control. And while some things are intended for harm, God uses them to accomplish His Purpose. So we forgive and move forward. @JeffFlake did what his conscience dictated. @ChuckGrassley be tough.

Don't blame the Democrats for being Democrats. Blame Republicans for being weak, lacking unity, allowing Democrats to bully them and letting @ChuckGrassley yield his Chair to the Democrats. @SenFlakeStaff usurped the process. And Kavenaugh is the victim of that betrayal. https://t.co/zFDs6jIGjL
@SenFlakeStaff @ChuckGrassley totally deflated me. Thinking voting at Midterms a waste of time. Next week Dems will complain investigation not finished, want another hearing to review findings and there are more witnesses to interview. Grassley ceded control of SJC. Poor @POTUS.

@ChuckGrassley should make a public statement or tweet letting Christine know her complaint and grievance was noted, respected and she can take satisfaction, closure and relief in that, if she doesn't want to pursue the matter further. Right now, she has the benefit of the doubt.
Not only are Democrats playing @ChuckGrassley, they're using Christine B. Ford for their political gain. Once she's no longer useful, she will be discarded like a hot organic potato. For sure she is reluctant to testify and they are doing everything possible to force her into it.
They almost executed the 1st Coup in the history of the USA, with help from UK and Australia. Now they don't want their names revealed. @POTUS better get something back from them in UN, EU, NATO, Trade and details, names, evidence of all involved in Coup Attempt. @FoxNews on it.

Sorry! Kavanaugh blew it! Too late now not to confirm, but unless he explains and makes amends for not shaking hands, I will always regret his confirmation. That seeminly minor event will have major repercussions on midterm election. Needs quick corrective action, strong apology. https://t.co/aq2LwbI9Tc
I could not agree with @ChrisCuomo more. At the very least, Kavanaugh could have shown minimal compassion, "I'm so sorry for your loss, Sir. It was a terrible tragedy." It will hurt @realDonaldTrump and @GOP to excuse his apparent insensitivity and civility. He must make amends. https://t.co/zYuIA4H38n
Full clip or not and unaware of what was said, Kavanaugh is the loser. He demonstrated a lack of sensitivity, respect, humility that won't sit well with most people. Now he'll have to explain, but optics are inescusably damaging. Reflects poorly on @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/zYuIA4H38n

Jesus came to die. The Apostles didn't preach prosperity. Jesus said His followers would suffer tribulation, persecution. We all want to prosper, but not at the expense of Christ's suffering. When the message at church is about Tithing and money, instead of the Cross, beware. https://t.co/Z6g6rl27AK
Democrats and anti @realDonaldTrump tried to bury @POTUS at McCain funeral, but he sliced his way out of it and came in under Par. @POTUS is playing a good game with Tariffs, Economy, NKor, Iran, EU, Canada, Mexico, China, Russia, Defense, Energy, Jobs, Justice. Build that Wall! https://t.co/YcoorQDNyM
It is OK! Sometimes, when you go golfing or play in the game of life and politics, you find yourself in the rough. But the object of the game is to get out of it and go for Par. By the way, was McCain buried under that ball? https://t.co/HpDeu5bOvF
To his credit, McCain accomplished a lot during his lifetime. He paid a higher price. His funeral was political because he was and his affiliation was anti-@realDonaldTrump. Many won't celebrate that, some will. What matters is that @POTUS continues to move this country forward.
