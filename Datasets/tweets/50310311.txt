An 11 year old girl in Argentina was raped by man more than 50 years her senior. She became pregnant and was then forced to wait until her 23rd week for an abortion. At that point, most doctors refused to perform the procedure.	https://t.co/Lr8iblcY2l
Abortion is standard medical care, and we can all agree that politics should not drive the standard of medical care. It's time that politicians step back and let doctors do their jobs.

One in four women will get an abortion in her lifetime. Yet, politicians have been spreading lies about this standard form of reproductive health care in an attempt to villainize these women. #HowDareYou
The facts are indisputable: abortion is safe and standard health care, and deciding if and when to have one is a decision for pregnant women and their doctors. Politicians have no right to interfere. #HowDareYou

Mandatory waiting periods require women to wait anywhere from 18-72 hours after requesting an abortion to receive one. These restrictions are meant to shame women and often increase costs for women traveling from far away. So why do 31 U.S. states have them on the books?

Contraceptive services and supplies can be costly, and countless individuals rely on publicly funded programs for access. When this care is restricted, many are forced to risk unplanned pregnancy or endanger their economic security.

On Tuesday, President Trump threw women's health under the bus in his #SOTU speech. He flat-out lied about legislation in NY and VA designed to protect abortion rights. We won't let political games undermine our rights. Get the facts here:	https://t.co/h8rcCMOs9T
#ThursdayThoughts: Maybe instead of playing politics with women’s health, the Trump administration should #EndGlobalGag with the #GlobalHERAct.
The Trump administration can't say that it supports women while it gambles with our health to score political points. #EndGlobalGag #GlobalHERAct	https://t.co/c86Q7YHI0Q
That’s why we are proud to stand with 113 other civil society organizations to endorse the #GlobalHERAct which will repeal the Trump administration’s disastrous #GlobalGagRule.
All people have fundamental #humanrights to health and life, regardless of where they live. The #GlobalGagRule fundamentally violates those rights, and it's time to put a stop to this dangerous policy forever.
The #GlobalGagRule has already stripped millions of women, girls, families, and communities of critical health care services and facilities.
Today, the #GlobalHERAct, which would permanently end the #GlobalGagRule, was introduced by @NitaLowey in the House with 150 cosponsors and @SenatorShaheen in the Senate with 45 cosponsors.
THREAD: 	The #GlobalGagRule has been wreaking havoc on millions around the world for far too long. Here's how we can end it FOR GOOD:

The VA legislation would end the 24-hour waiting period for abortion patients, remove the state-mandated ultrasound, and require one doctor—instead of three—to approve a request for an abortion after 13 weeks. #SOTU
Tonight’s #SOTU was full of lies about abortion. Every pregnancy and every woman’s circumstances are different. Women and their doctors are capable decision-makers, and politicians should never interfere with their decisions.
Don’t get the spin from politicians, get the facts from OB-GYN, @DrDGrossman #FactsMatter @Rewire_News #SOTU https://t.co/KiqfdsCDNd
The NY law simply removes abortion from the criminal code, solidifies Roe v. Wade in state law, and allows patients who need abortion after 24 weeks to get care in their home state rather than travel across the country. #SOTU
THREAD:	With all the lies being used in tonight's #SOTU to twist NY and VA’s legislation to protect abortion, it’s important to know what these laws actually do.
The RHA is not radical: All it does is protect existing rights under Roe v. Wade. The reason politicians and now the President in #SOTU are spreading lies is because their one goal is to end all legal abortion in our nation. We can't let them dictate the terms of the debate.

Judge Kavanaugh told us yesterday that Roe was “settled law” – this email shows us why that answer isn’t good enough. SCOTUS can overturn or gut that precedent.
Judge Kavanaugh has previously referred to Rehnquist and Scalia as his judicial heroes, and praised their respective dissents in Roe and Casey rejecting the constitutional protection of the right to abortion.
In the 2003 email, Judge Kavanaugh said there were three justices willing to overturn Roe on the Court – likely referring to Chief Justice Rehnquist, and Justices Scalia and Thomas.
In 2003, referring to Roe v. Wade, Judge Kavanaugh wrote that the Supreme Court "can always overrule its precedent.”

Judge Kavanaugh’s decision is fully out of alignment with the Bellotti v. Baird case (1979) – the controlling U.S. Supreme Court precedent on parental consent and judicial bypass. #StopKavanaugh
Judge Kavanaugh continues to bring up the need for “parental consent” despite the fact that Jane Doe obtained a judicial bypass—a court order allowing her to obtain an abortion on her own volition—which the Trump admin then continued to block her from accessing. #StopKavanaugh
.@SenBlumenthal: “‘Abortion on demand’ is a code word in the anti-choice community.” 		Judge Kavanaugh used the phrase THREE times in his dissent. #KavanaughTranslator
Access to abortion shouldn't depend on your zip code. Constitutionally-protected rights are not determined by the state you live in. #StopKavanaugh
Judge Kavanaugh's own colleague on the DC Circuit said that his decision delaying Jane Doe's abortion until she had an adequate support network would "require a troubling and dramatic rewriting of Supreme Court precedent.” #JusticeForJane #StopKavanaugh
Judge Kavanaugh called Jane Doe’s case “undeniably difficult situation.” His decision would have only made it worse for her. 	 	She already fought for a judicial bypass, which would have allowed her to get an abortion, yet Kavanaugh still refused to recognize her autonomy.
Judge Kavanaugh says "I understand the real world effects of our decisions" but his decision in Garza v. Hargan would have directly harmed an immigrant minor by stopping her from exercising her constitutionally-protected right to an abortion. #WhatsAtStake #JusticeForJane

Our President and CEO Nancy Northup is live on @maddow NOW talking about Trump's #SCOTUSPick, Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Tune in to @MSNBC.
We cannot place the future of reproductive rights in America into the hands of someone with such a dangerous repro record. Email your Senator TONIGHT to fight to protect Roe v. Wade. #SaveSCOTUS	https://t.co/jACItwu0Mf
In the past 45 years, the constitutional protections for abortion rights have been deliberately weakened by state-level restrictions that drive abortion providers out of practice, invade privacy, and endanger the health of those seeking care.  #SaveSCOTUS
Kavanaugh also ruled to allow employer’s religious beliefs to override an individual’s right to contraceptive coverage and established that he would give near-absolute deference to claims of religious objection. #SaveSCOTUS
Last year, Kavanaugh dissented in the #JusticeForJane case, deciding AGAINST Jane Doe, the 17 year-old undocumented minor seeking abortion care while in the custody of HHS.  #SaveSCOTUS
BREAKING: Trump has selected Brett Kavanaugh as his pick for the open Supreme Court Justice seat. Trump set a CLEAR litmus test to nominate Justices who will overturn Roe—we can assume Kavanaugh passed the test. #SaveSCOTUS https://t.co/viHfVYcTXy

A lifetime of systemic racism and the physical toll that takes may play a large part in the maternal mortality rates for Black women.  https://t.co/GrU0K7zoQW
Ignoring the intersection of abortion rights and so many other rights issues completely ignores the experience of millions of women. We reject this flawed argument and the erasure of women who need and deserve access to abortion care.
Ensuring that women having full control over their lives and futures should ALWAYS be a top priority, never a bargaining chip. Abortion access doesn't distract from issues of poverty, immigration, income equality and racial justice - it's deeply intertwined with them. https://t.co/55HLzmOSMb
Quick reminder: Reproductive rights are HUMAN RIGHTS.
