@TrumpClinton6 @benshapiro Honestly through this whole thing I lost track of my original point. I don‚Äôt believe that people are guilty before proven innocent. But I think differently of normal human beings and genocidal dictators.
@TrumpClinton6 @benshapiro One.
@TrumpClinton6 @benshapiro That‚Äôs a different story. I can see Ben‚Äôs and you‚Äôre point unless the crime involves someone dying.
@TrumpClinton6 @benshapiro Correct. I care more about 12 million people who would die in the Holocaust more than one guy who probably will grow up to kill them.
@TrumpClinton6 @benshapiro I agree if you‚Äôre talking about people who aren‚Äôt genocidal maniacs.
@TrumpClinton6 @benshapiro This is of course different from someone who would grow up to rob a bank.
@TrumpClinton6 @benshapiro My point in all of this is, what person that actually cares about these atrocities, given the chance wouldn‚Äôt kill these men and instead take the chance of them growing up to do the same thing. Even if it‚Äôs a slight chance, with these specific men, I wouldn‚Äôt take the chance.
@TrumpClinton6 @benshapiro Hitler became Anti-Senstic due to his upbringing, admiration of a Vienna mayor, and bitterness from Germany‚Äôs loss in World War One. The other two committed these atrocities due to their upbringing.
@I_Am_The_Christ Je≈õus does sound like a great guy.
@TrumpClinton6 @benshapiro Yes but again using any of them implies that the person who would kill them has foresight into what they would do in the future.

@TrumpClinton6 @benshapiro No but the point is it happened. And if you could go back in time and kill him, I wouldn‚Äôt take the risk of him becoming the same thing or worse when the problem could be eliminated entirely. It‚Äôs common sense.

@benshapiro If you just used a standard criminal and not the Hitler name, I don‚Äôt see an issue with what you said, despite my opposing stance on abortion.
@benshapiro Honestly, I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with what you said except for the Hitler part. Most people would kill him if you knew the atrocities he would later commit. He isn‚Äôt just a baby if you know what his future is. If you didn‚Äôt use a genocidal maniac there would be no issue.

@doro_will @RyanAFournier The country needs to be rebuilt after this disaster of a Presidency. And even though Puerto Rico isn‚Äôt a majority white place, Republicans should pay attention to it.

@RyanAFournier He fixed it after a Republican allowed the 2008 financial crisis to happen. Prior to Trump the economy was weaker but by no means bad.
So to any of you accusing Liberals of being Nazis, look at what the two parties campaign for. Look at the laws each support. You will see who the actual Nazis are after that.
The Democrats are for Democracy, the Republicans refuse to admit that Russia meddled in the 2016 election despite overwhelming evidence from American Intelligence Agencies that they did and instead believe the KGB.
The minorities that the claim to accept. Democrats are champions of civil rights, the Republicans are not. The Democrats are for a free Media, the Republicans are not.
The saddest part isn‚Äôt even that some people who support this know what they are doing, the saddest part is that a majority of Republican voters (At least I hope it‚Äôs a majority) either can‚Äôt or refuse to understand that their own party is working against them and the minorities.
The GOP under Trump has sadly become a party of bigotry and hate. Separating families at the Southern Border, refusing to condemn Neo-Nazis, allowing our democracy to fall under Russian influence, trying to censor any non-conservative media, trying to take away peoples healthcare
So to anyone who is saying that what @BarackObama is saying about President Trump is wrong, remember this, any Liberal would instantly protect our country from Nazis or from Russians. Liberals want to protect our democracy.
I‚Äôm not saying all Republicans are Nazis, John McCain sure wasn‚Äôt but there are definitely a few. And don‚Äôt forget that when the Unite the Right rally first occurred in Charlottesville, @realDonaldTrump refused to condemn the Neo-Nazis directly.
On the promise of making Germany great again. To bring it back to its pre-WW1 glory. Now if you remember correctly, Neo-Nazis and the KKK who have the same views on race and religion support the Republicans.
He also capitalized on the threat of the Communist threat to the east and scared people into voting for him just because of the Communist Menace. The Nazis won the German elections by campaigning on fear and the promise of German superiority.
They silenced opposition. They took away personal freedoms. They saw issues in their country and blamed it on the Jews. Hitler campaigned on Jews ‚Äúbackstabbing‚Äù Germany in WW1 and demanded revenge.
I don‚Äôt understand how Conservatives could even try to accuse Liberals of being Nazis. The Nazis killed 12 million people due to their ancestry and religion. The Nazis tried to conquer the world and ‚Äúpurify‚Äù it.

@billhensley61 @Nguyen_T_Cuong @RyanAFournier Taking the illegals out will cause more problems than it would fix. Also defunding a city won‚Äôt make illegals leave or change the political views of city officials. You care more about illegals leaving then American citizens themselves.
@RSmyth22 @RyanAFournier @realDonaldTrump More Republican.
@realDonaldTrump You are a true disgrace. Ignore the politics. John McCain was undeniably a great man and you say nothing after hearing about his decision to stop his cancer treatment. You are the opposite of what the he always stood for. You are scum not just to your party, but to the country.
He has done so many good things, too many to count but that example shows that he truly represents what is good about America. The decision that he made today is a tragedy but he has left a mark on this nation that will not be forgotten.
For example, during his 2008 Presidential Campaign against Barack Obama, he stood up to a crowd of his own supporters and defended Obama after his supporters made racist remarks about the future President by saying just because he isn‚Äôt white, it doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs a bad person.
Senator John McCain is a patriot. He represents what the Republican Party could be. He always stood for American values and advocated for what was right.

@Nguyen_T_Cuong @billhensley61 @RyanAFournier I would say that you are right if most illegals came in from the southern border. A majority of illegals don‚Äôt come in through the southern border but by overstaying their welcome on visas. The cities would still harbor them. The wall would give them minimum relief.
@Nguyen_T_Cuong @billhensley61 @RyanAFournier My point is, what about the vast majority of the population? Why cut the funds that would benefit them?
@Nguyen_T_Cuong @billhensley61 @RyanAFournier Yes more funding will be required but let‚Äôs take New York City as an example. Throughout the city of more than 8 million people, the second most populous city on the continent, only about half a million people are undocumented immigrants. Less than a 16th of the population.
@Nguyen_T_Cuong @billhensley61 @RyanAFournier But although the federal government may not agree with what these cities are doing, they are American cities and can‚Äôt just be abandoned. Otherwise I would say that you are right.

@jules618790 @MinetteKelly @RyanAFournier @HLNTV No she questioned why the news didn‚Äôt report this and  he did. She didn‚Äôt question anything.
@billhensley61 @RyanAFournier At least you have the decency to admit that not all are bad. I personally don‚Äôt think they should all be sent back. I think they should be given the chance to become citizens and in the future build up border security so illegal immigration is no longer a thing.
@jules618790 @MinetteKelly @RyanAFournier @HLNTV She said that the news didn‚Äôt report that the guy was illegal and Ryan Fournier did. So she didn‚Äôt know the guy was illegal until this guy told her. He was right this time but believing every word he says isn‚Äôt right either.
@Lisa10xxx @RyanAFournier Most illegals come in to the country legally with a visa and overstay their welcome. Look at the statistics. A wall won‚Äôt do anything.
@Lisa10xxx @RyanAFournier First of all, Fox is Mainstream Media. Also guards let children die without medical care. Oh but you don‚Äôt know that, because Fox refused to report it!
@Lisa10xxx @RyanAFournier They don‚Äôt hate them and look at things from the perspective of both Jews and Arabs. I personally believe in a two-state solution for the Israel-Palestinian conflict.
@Lisa10xxx @RyanAFournier Also, in my opinion all Jewish Conservatives are hypocrites. They should look at their own history and see that they are doing to other people what was done to them. Another thing, Democrats aren‚Äôt anti-Israel.
@Lisa10xxx @RyanAFournier Actually you brought up the Mexicans, look at your previous tweet. Also being Jewish and Israeli are not the same thing. I am pro-Israel but I‚Äôm not going to ignore all other policies from the Republican Party because they hate Arabs more than Jews. I vote for America not Israel.
@Lisa10xxx @RyanAFournier So Conservatives are right to lock children in cages and discriminate based on race?
@jules618790 @MinetteKelly @RyanAFournier @HLNTV But @MinetteKelly didn‚Äôt. They didn‚Äôt know the person was illegal until they saw the original tweet.
@frankmartini123 @MinetteKelly @RyanAFournier @HLNTV I may not agree with you on politics but at least you acknowledge that about Fox News. I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised.
@Lisa10xxx @RyanAFournier I know Holocaust survivors personally and seeing another race being treated the same way the Jews have for centuries, sickens me. I wouldn‚Äôt be saying this if YOU didn‚Äôt blame this on the Mexicans. You blamed it on illegals AND Mexicans. Not just illegals. Remember that.
@Lisa10xxx @RyanAFournier You accused me of ‚Äúonly caring about the Mexicans‚Äù not the illegals, the MEXICANS. So at least from you this discrimination is not due to them breaking the law, but due to race. You make me sick, making a murder into this. I am liberal because I am Jewish.
@Lisa10xxx @RyanAFournier But building a wall isn‚Äôt going to help and you need to deal with the issue the right way. These illegals are also human beings. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they are locked in cages to you or treated like scum, because to you, they are sub-human just because they are Mexican.
@Lisa10xxx @RyanAFournier All you do is spout conservative propaganda from your overlord Trump. You can‚Äôt blame an entire race for a murder. I don‚Äôt think illegal immigration is right. My family came here through Ellis Island the right way after being persecuted for being Jewish in Eastern Europe.
@Lisa10xxx @RyanAFournier You don‚Äôt care that Mollie is dead. You only care about kicking out the Mexicans

@RyanAFournier Of course you have to bring politics into the murder of an innocent person. You should be ashamed of yourself. Mollie Tivbetts is sadly dead and all you do is twist it around to attack illegal immigrants. Someone‚Äôs death should not be used to try to prove your own political views
It‚Äôs hilarious how @realDonaldTrump hasn‚Äôt tweeted about Manafort yet and probably won‚Äôt. He‚Äôs too afraid to get involved. Almost as afraid he is of women and minorities in power.
It‚Äôs good to see that Paul Manafort is getting what he deserves.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You stole ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù from Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan. Your hypocrisy surrounds you.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Just a nice way of saying ‚ÄúScrew the planet, we want money!‚Äù
@DatniggaBrey It‚Äôs symbolic, a war criminal should not be in the U.S at all. He deserves way worse than this but sadly no government except the Israelis, will treat him like what he is, scum.
@DatniggaBrey He‚Äôs being forced to leave a country that he‚Äôs been living in for years. He has to start a brand new life. It‚Äôs better than nothing.
@DatniggaBrey This is still a form of punishment.
@DatniggaBrey When your own people were murdered by this guy, you want any punishment possible.
The U.S has deported former Nazi guard Jakiw Palij back to Germany. It‚Äôs good to see that at least part of the government can do justice to these animals despite the other part loving them.
