Forgot a recent one: @nymagunion
@robdelaney thanks ron
There aren't a lot of ways to make swift, meaningful improvements in our workplaces and our lives. The growing movement in the media business shows that forming a union is one of them. I personally hope that workers in other fields are inspired by what we've done.
And Gothamist writers are now @sagaftra members. Previously, DNAinfo and Gothamist joined the @WGAEast, but their billionaire anti-union owner shuttered the business rather than deal with his employees on fair terms. Gothamist re-formed under WNYC and joined a different union.
It's not only the @WGAEast. The @news_guild recently has organized unions at shops including:	@latguild	@newyorkerunion	@pvnewsguild	@sinewsguild	@ctguild	@law360union	@caspernewsguild	@chesapeakeguild	@timesunionguild	@owhguild	@tidewaterguild	@zdcreatorsguild	@rewirenewsunion
Interested in organizing the digital news shop where you work? Start here, and ask any @WGAEast member (like me!) for more information. https://t.co/kuOI4n1GDf
Read the @WGAEast contracts for digital and broadcast news outlets and ask yourself why you shouldn't have these same things. https://t.co/33xvCm24UM
That represents more than 1,500 digital media workers who've fought for and won union membership. Those shops that already have contracts have secured things like pay raises, guaranteed severance, job-security protections, and diversity initiatives they otherwise wouldn't have.
Since 2015, the following news outlets have joined the @WGAEast:	@gmgunion	@viceunion	@TP_Union	@HuffPostUnion 	@FastCoUnion	@OnionIncUnion	@R29Union	@SlateUnion	@thedodounion	@InterceptUnion	@thrillistunion	@vox_union	Talking Points Memo	MTV News	Salon
For those who weren't following, @SlateUnion had to fight through a bunch of bullshit, the worst of which was Slate trying to force them into an open shop where union membership was optional. The company failed. This should be an inspiration to anyone thinking about organizing.

@BKLYNlibrary @nypl It's a wonderful system and I'm grateful for it.
And even in the examples that are obviously correct -- Mike Cernovich is right, Norm Ornstein is center, Matt Bruenig is left -- are the opposite of informative.
When your model spits out that Michael Moore, Charlie Pierce, Brian Beutler, David Roberts, Adam Serwer, Spencer Ackerman, and Josh Kraushaar are centrists and Jonathan Chait is leftist, maybe your methodology is wrong and stupid and you should go back to the drawing board.
The premise is absurdly reductive. Who journalists follow on Twitter tells you almost nothing. I follow Trump. Does anything I've ever written make anyone who's read it think I keep a MAGA hat i my closet?

To be fair to Emanuel and the 2006 Democrats, they probably wouldn't have won a House majority that year otherwise, and Bush's second term would've been quite different with a GOP Congress the whole time.
Of course, the Graham family - which owns Slate - has always been anti-union. WaPo still has a weak union because of the open shop it had when the Graham's owned it and famously set up its dot com operation in Virginia years ago to avoid its digital employees being unionized.

@claytonmathis I think he might be high at this very moment, in fact.
Same for Montana. Medicaid expansion is losing by 10 points with 69% of precincts reporting and we still don't have an official call. I sincerely don't understand how this works. Closer races were called hours ago.
Seriously, though, can someone who understands how the AP calls races or how Utah counts votes explain to me how having 54% of the vote with three-quarters of the precincts reporting isn't enough to call a race?

@kemc What's interesting is the last time Montana increased the tobacco tax, it was through a ballot initiative. That probably made them confident it would work again, especially when linked to an existing program established on a bipartisan basis. It's looking like they miscalculated.

The Utah Medicaid expansion vote, which would provide coverage to as many as 150,000 people, hasn't been called yet. But it's winning with 54% of the vote and 74% of precincts reporting.
Meanwhile, it's increasingly looking like Montanans are more concerned about smokers paying higher taxes than about kicking 90,000 poor people off Medicaid. No votes are now leading at 55% and 60% of precincts reporting. Tobacco companies spent millions on this race.
The Idaho Medicaid expansion initiative has passed with 62% of the vote and 67% of precincts reported. Advocates say it will cover 62,000 people.
Nebraska's Medicaid expansion ballot initiative has passed with 53% of the vote and 93% of precincts reporting. An estimated 90,000 people will gain health coverage as a result.

@originalgriz @word_34 @aawayne What a stupid mistake! In my defense, I'm extremely tired.

Trump's Justice Department is currently awaiting a ruling from a judge it asked to eliminate the ACA's pre-existing conditions protections. In the same lawsuit, GOP attorneys general want the judge to kill the entire law. https://t.co/jQmFXqsL8m

The Utah legislature has been "researching" this for years. And the real-world experience of states that already expanded clearly shows the effects of the policy. The only reason not to do it is if you believe poor people don't deserve health care because they can't afford it. https://t.co/OzN5EO82CL

@charles_gaba @CitizenCohn I mean, just for instance, if you're like most privately enrolled people, your insurance is employer-based. If the carrier doesn't meet the MLR requirement, your company gets the benefit, not you. You just get a letter telling you about your employer's tiny windfall.

@SimonMaloy Today's remark is really only a slight shift from where's he's always been philosophically. To me, what's notable is his apparent perception that the politics have changed and maybe people won't freak out if they lose their current insurance and have Medicare for All instead.
@SimonMaloy His case against doing that instead of something like the ACA is that there are a lot of people who already have insurance who would freak out about major changes. Given that we're still talking about a couple million canceled plans in 2013 after the ACA, I think he had a point.
@SimonMaloy As for single payer, he said as long ago as 2003 that it would be his first choice if he were starting from scratch, something he later repeated.
@SimonMaloy I think your recollection of the history here is off. On the mandate, Obama's original argument was that people were uninsured because they couldn't afford it, not because they weren't mandated to buy insurance. His White House team talked him out of that when he became president

(Finally, there was a glitch on the WGAE's voting website earlier today that only allowed us to choose one candidate. If you've already voted, I recommend logging in again and amending your ballot.)
There's also room for growth in other areas, like the WGAE's ongoing efforts to organize reality TV writers and producers. And we need to sustain the union's work on vital issues like promoting workplace diversity and fighting sexual violence and harassment in the workplace.
Organizing newsrooms is important not just for those of us who work in them, but because we are a prominent public example of what labor organizing can do for workers. Unions are under sustained assault, but the WGAE keeps getting bigger. We can't let up.
To keep making the protections and rights we've secured available to more workers in our industry, Kelly and I believe digital media needs more representation on the Council. Currently, workers from our field hold two of the 19 seats on the Council. We want to double that.
The WGAE has been expanding rapidly, thanks to the union's terrific organizers and staff and to journalists at digital media outlets like HuffPost, Gizmodo, the Intercept, ThinkProgress, Vice, and the many others now organizing or negotiating contracts.
If you're eligible to vote as a WGAE member, you should have received an email from the Guild today with the subject line "WGAE 2018 Officers and Council Election." Please open it, follow the instructions and vote today!
Attention fellow Writers Guild of America, East members: Council elections begin today and run until Sept. 20. Please consider voting for me and Kelly Stout (@scoutstout).

Time magazine wasn't praising Hitler, Stalin (twice), Khrushchev, King Faisal, Deng Xiaoping (twice), Ayatollah Khomeini, Yuri Andropov, Ken Starr, Putin, Trump, or, uh, Wallis Simpson when it named them Man/Person of the Year.
Modern Healthcare is great and I really value its reporting. But lists are dumb and using lists like this to make a point is even dumber.
During Obama years, Kathleen Sebelius ranked 1st once, 2nd twice, and 5th twice, while Sylvia Burwell ranked 3rd once, 5th once, and 6th once. In 2017, Trump was listed 7th and Tom Price 13th. This year, Trump is 1st and Alex Azar is 15th.
Yes, it's not surprising. Obama was #1 on this list four times and was 2nd once, 3rd twice, 4th once, and 5th once, dating back to 2008. Modern Healthcare isn't endorsing policies; it's identifying powerful people. https://t.co/rkiPbECvpO

When I was in high school, I had a friend who was such a bad tipper, I'd sometimes sneak back into the restaurant to leave more money for the server. He got his comeuppance when he worked as a waiter at a chain restaurant to help pay for college. He quickly changed his attitude.

I actually could not be friends with someone who thinks and acts that way.
The justification she uses to not tip service people would also apply to just straight-up stealing shit. "I'd rather spend my money on other things." Not tipping workers in jobs where tips are customary is stealing from those workers.

Postscript: Maybe someday Republican politicians will come up with a better way to run a health care system. They thus far have completely failed to do so. https://t.co/Cl18rxbU2d
There's no reason to believe that the Trump administration will reverse course and instead try to make the ACA work as best as possible. That's bad news for the people who rely on this market for their health coverage. /fin
There's much, much more, some of which HuffPost covered and some of which other outlets did. That includes more subtle things, like the federal officials who run these programs constantly badmouthing it and references to the ACA being disappeared from government websites.
Potentially the most damaging thing is the Trump administration's refusal to defend the ACA in a lawsuit from GOP state officials seeking to invalidate it. The DoJ wants a federal court to toss most of the ACA's protections for pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/jQmFXqKmwW
The biggest "reforms" Trump and other GOP officials are making to the health insurance system amount to making bad insurance more widely available. https://t.co/9hClpVyf4S
Basically, the Trump administration has done virtually nothing to address the actual shortcomings of the ACA and has done lots to make it worse. https://t.co/Mgdl7bIbLj
The Trump administration is fully aware of its progress in breaking the ACA insurance market, too. https://t.co/D7FEXD0fX4
Trump's ongoing Obamacare sabotage, by the way, has measurable, harmful effects on people. https://t.co/00tYT4WWWO
The Trump administration also has taken aim at Medicaid, inviting states to seek approval for new rules requiring some beneficiaries to work if they want to keep their benefits. It's a solution in search of a problem. https://t.co/3XFztCqDad
Congress repealed the tax penalties for people who don't comply with the ACA's individual mandate. Everyone hates the mandate, but removing the penalties caused insurers to raise rates in anticipation of fewer healthy customers. https://t.co/tMJyOnTMwE
Insurers and state regulators found a workaround to protect subsidized ACA customers from those premium increases, but Trump's actions still hurt unsubsidized people and caused unnecessary confusion for shoppers. https://t.co/fcg6GDnd0S
Trump also refused to pay billions of dollars the federal government owes health insurance companies serving the poorest customers, which led to premium increases. https://t.co/9QgkaMMj6G
Trump's executive actions on health care mostly seek to permit insurance companies to resume selling junk plans with skimpy benefits and little-to-no protections for people with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/xGOSMx8gu1
Once repeal failed, Trump turned right to executive actions that threaten to undermine the insurance system the ACA established. https://t.co/ItQwnbAayY
The Trump administration's cuts to enrollment and outreach campaigns will be even deeper for the next open enrollment period than they were for the last one. https://t.co/rrHD6QcCNk
Right after Trump took office, his administration canceled TV ads the Obama administration had already bought to promote health insurance enrollment. The next year, they slashed funding for advertising and enrollment assistance. https://t.co/Z8igm8d7B5
Let's start here, with the simple fact that Trump has, right out in the open, frequently talked about sabotaging the ACA for political gain. https://t.co/RqTSChvPoj
Since the beginning of 2017, the Trump administration and Congress have continued their assault on the ACA. The following are examples of what I mean, as chronicled by @CitizenCohn and me...

@drvox I just don't see a difference. "Let the other team have the ball/puck/etc. more" seems like a bad way to win at sports. And I'm not a soccer weirdo. It's fourth on the list of sports I like.
