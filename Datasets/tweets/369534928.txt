@TopherSpiro @larry_levitt @sangerkatz On exchange enrollment you mean right? I don't think we knew about off exchange. And the report yesterday showed it declined by 1.3 million between 2016 and 2017
@TopherSpiro @larry_levitt @sangerkatz You're saying the 1.3 million drop in off-exchange enrollment between 2016 and 2017, when premiums rose 21 percent, was because of Trump? This basically occurred before he took office. no?
@larry_levitt @sangerkatz So you think it's fair to characterize yesterday's report as "1.5 million people dropped out of obamacare coverage between 2016 and 2017"?
@sangerkatz Yeah true. That is the larger picture. But if you're asking like "how well are obamacare signups doing?" it matters whether you are counting off exchange or not. Maybe that question is not that useful!
@sangerkatz One interesting question to me is whether off exchange counts as "Obamacare." Is Obamacare just the exchanges or the whole individual market? I guess depends on how you define it

All the statements from the health industry seem pretty measured/noncommittal? Maybe because everyone is still furiously reading through
Trump's plan is not an assault on the drug industry (their stocks were up after the speech) but still includes some policies they oppose https://t.co/crNrQrCUvC
.@peterbachmd says possible changes to rebates in Trump's plan would be "an enormous market shifting step" whose effects would be hard to predict https://t.co/crNrQrCUvC
Nothing critical in PBM CVS Health's statement: "Policy solutions that lower drug prices for consumers and reduce out-of-pocket costs are aligned with CVS Health‚Äôs business model and would not be expected to have a negative impact on profitability. "
So looks like both drug companies and PBMs stock prices are up after the speech

This seems to be reference to Medicare competitive acquisition program in part b https://t.co/cYs13Cbln0 https://t.co/zkrmCvhDmt
.@SecAzar on CNBC this morning on the drug plan: "It's a nuanced, it's a sophisticated, it's a balanced approach. It's the kind of thing you'd expect from a CEO and businessman like Donald Trump."
@ASlavitt What are your thoughts on what they've been floating on Part B? Seems sort of similar to the 2016 proposal, no?
There has to be at least some chance that Trump gets up there and throws in a call for Medicare to negotiate drug prices anyway
@sangerkatz Also even if he called for Medicare drug negotiation it would require congress, where chances are slim at best this year. More chance of actually doing something administratively, as will be the focus

Merkley is asking Azar about a public option....he shockingly does not support it
Asked if Trump's plan will target drug companies directly, Azar says "Yes it will. All players will be impacted." (ie not just PBMs)
@larry_levitt So arguably the main people harmed by short-term plans are people above 400 fpl who are sick, but maybe they couldn't afford coverage already?
Azar points to ObamaCare subsidies as preventing too many from shifting into short-term plans: "People are not going to be leaving subsidized insurance" for short-term plans, he says
Azar says the plan will address "all aspects" of drug pricing including drug companies and PBMs
What percentage of lawmaker questions at HHS secretary hearings are obscure points about Medicare programs that hospitals in their district asked them to ask?

New: Trump's health chief Alex Azar says he supports CDC research on gun violence at congressional hearing. "We certainly will" research it, he says https://t.co/NUD0gBKaie
@adamcancryn This hearing has really straightened that whole situation out...
Wyden corrects Azar to point out that Idaho is not actually applying for a waiver. They're just going ahead and not following all ACA rules. Gives Azar 10 days to respond
Dems have been praising Azar for calling them to check in ahead of his hearings. GOP used to praise Burwell for that too. Less prominent with Price
Interesting legal argument from Sen. Risch here on Idaho's move to get around ObamaCare https://t.co/jKE1LAeMuu https://t.co/dhTcISkiwa
Asked which of Trump's drug pricing proposals will become law by the end of the year, Chairman @repgregwalden says that's "too specific of a question" and his committee is still reviewing costs in many sectors
Based on the Ways and Means hearing today with Azar, it appears both parties have forgotten that ObamaCare exists and are mostly concerned with wonky Medicare things that most people have never heard of

Our story on the executive order: https://t.co/uNJiGEeFaR
Trump says the order is "starting the process" of repeal
Rand Paul, Virginia Foxx, and Greg Walden are at the EO signing, per WH
Another interesting thing from the EO: directs HHS to look at ways to increase competition, including *provider* competition
Executive order will not address whether these alternative plans are exempt from mandate penalty. Up to rulemaking sounds like
Officials say all the changes ordered by today's EO have to go through regular notice and comment. Could take months
Nothing definitive on whether individuals can join AHP but admin. official says "some employer employee relationship must be present"
