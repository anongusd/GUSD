You hit it out of the park @realDonaldTrump ! Best speech ever. https://t.co/Z23yypZUVW
@BradSherman has no answers on @IngrahamAngle and a perverted ideas about history, wages, jobs...Obama did nothing but sell the American people out.  I’m ashamed as a resident of California that he is our representative.
@staceyabrams is jaded and clueless about the economy and the benefits of tax cuts, regulatory reform, and trade negotiations. If that the best the democrats can muster-2020 will be a republican landslide. Voter suppression to her is letting anyone vote.
@POTUS is winning the unity in the Congress, what a great speech!
@SpeakerPelosi is heartless, as  @realDonaldTrump talks about the murders, sex traffickers and criminal aliens, she sat smirking. @SenGillibrand and @KamalaHarris look like they swallowed a big dose of truth.
I agree @SenSchumer and @SpeakerPelosi lie so much they have lost any credibility they may have once had. https://t.co/kGPzTHEmAh
Seems accurate @AOC . Maybe thinking before spewing is in order. https://t.co/n7buCqTk6C
@LeaderHoyer just gave Fox an interview in which he expressed bald face lies and deceitful answers to questions. What will it take for the country to be protected from illegal immigrants. How many more have to die before you do your job. Secure our border!
@SpeakerPelosi didn’t see the crime because the wall around her $$$$compound is too tall. https://t.co/xnaP2D8c4s

@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Medical professionals, not necessarily docs in NYS. The VA bill was the same. You don’t support killing babies up until labor do you?
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump It’s foolish to bury your head in the sand and pretendthere isn’t a border crisis. Obstruction won’t change it. For a doc you seem a little clueless.
@repocrazio You are sick, seek help through the new Medicare for all program for Congress.
@repocrazio Are you actually saying it’s okay to hate the Jewish people?
Why are all the moralists in the Dimocrats Party like hypocrite @SenSchumer and racist @GovernorVA allowed to continue in office. If either of these fools were GOP the Dim media would be calling for tar and feathering them... https://t.co/8Z0UpXamF0
Why are tweets critical of @RalphNortham disappearing? Why does Twitter protect racists and baby killers?
@RalphNortham so today’s lie, the editors did it. We do not believe it! You are a hypocrite,  a member of the party that helped found the KKK.  Given statements this week about aborting full term babies, you have not changed, you’ve just been caught. Resign! https://t.co/D8lB9DKnCl
It should not surprise us that a zealot democrat shows up in photos like this. Democrats supported the KKK. Just proof of the hypocrisy we see from Democrats on a daily basis. https://t.co/5KedrdupoY
@RobertJohnDavi @BeachyKate69 Great job and so true, thanks!
So true-reason is alive in Hollywood, don’t you agree @SpeakerPelosi  and @KamalaHarris. Target the walls around your homes first and then work out from there. I’ve got a sledge hammer to help...of course you will dismiss your armed security staffers as well right? Okay, thanks! https://t.co/MhxJmJShkA
@RalphNortham is apparently advocating stone cold murder of children be legalized in the State of VA-thankfully that was voted down. The bill was immoral just as the law @NYGovCuomo signed into law is.  As a former resident of NY I hope the citizens rise up and impeach Cuomo. https://t.co/9cJS7JxKfl
Rams advance, but it’s a victory tainted by really unfair officiating, what a shame...

@senatemajldr how many more Americans have to be killed by illegal immigrants before the Senate takes a vote on the wall?
@senatemajldr should call for a vote on the wall. That way Americans can see who wants to protect them and those who don’t.
For the safety and security of our nation, we need the wall.  @senatemajldr eliminate the filibuster rule and go to a majority vote on the wall.  Let’s get this done.
Stand tall Mr. President @realDonaldTrump , we, the people stand with you! #buildthewallnow https://t.co/DLe1vhZ6nX
