The Israeli attorney general is seeking to indict prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on corruption and bribery charges, yet, here in America, Justice Department guidelines prohibit the indictment of a sitting president. Why is that?

President Donald Trump has promised to “drain the swamp,” yet the Senate just confirmed former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler to be EPA Administrator. #TrumpFail #GOPHypocrisy
@rkellythompson @Outkick @ClayTravis He probably won’t get re-elected either.
I understood that reference. #AFewGoodMen https://t.co/hsoWsQVGaZ
@PalmerReport Mark Meadows knows he doesn’t have any ammo against Michael Cohen, hence why he’s saying all this bluster.
@iBeMaloney @ClayTravis As the saying goes, pics or it didn’t happen. But Trump cultists are willing to do anything to defend their lord and savior Donald Trump.

@gnossos1211 @WillOMalone @ClayTravis @AOC @realDonaldTrump Eating egg salad with a comb sounds pretty badass.
@PavethePlanet09 @ClayTravis I know this: Southern businessmen don’t like labor unions because the word “union” reminds them of the Union Army. 😎
@mother_mills @ClayTravis @AOC I like AOC as a person because she’s down to earth, approachable, snarky, and cute, but she needs to tone down the rhetoric. Even Nancy Pelosi told her to pump the brakes.
@ToTheBreakOfDan @ClayTravis Nah, they won’t brand him as alt-right.
@delawarenole @ClayTravis Tell that to President Trump and Congress in general.
@PavethePlanet09 @ClayTravis If you’re thankful for child labor laws, minimum wage, 40-hour work weeks, workers comp, etc., thank a labor union.
@WillOMalone @ClayTravis @AOC Both she and @realDonaldTrump are ignorant too. Amy Klobuchar has my vote for 2020 because she’s pragmatic and doesn’t pander to identity politics but I digress. Most members of Congress aren’t very bright to be fair; it’s just AOC happens to be very outspoken and brash.
@ClayTravis Bill de Blasio and Andrew Cuomo wanted Amazon to come to NYC too.

@PeterBurnsESPN “In My Feelings” by Drake
@AliceWonder32 @WalshFreedom If there’s any silver lining to this Trump presidency, it’s that he exposed white evangelicals as disingenuous hypocrites.
@ClayTravis Why are Sandmann and his attorneys specifically targeting the Washington Post and not all the news outlets that covered this story? (I think it’s a political stunt since Trump and Bezos begrudge each other.)
@WorkingLawFirm @ClayTravis I agree that the right has a similar snowflake outrage complex. Just look at Trump cultists on social media whenever they see a “negative” (albeit factual) article about their lord and savior.
@ClayTravis He’s giving @realDonaldTrump a taste of his own medicine (i.e., pettiness).
@HeyUhEhEh @ClayTravis Trump is even more narcissistic. The man dodged the Vietnam draft because of “bone spurs.”

@NickMathews21 @CNN I like the idea of it but I have feasibility concerns.
@CharlesBFarr It’s her first big TV gig. The more she goes in front of a national TV audience, the less nervous she’ll be. It’s also possible she’s very excited about being on such a national stage.
Do you think Amy Klobuchar can beat Donald Trump in 2020 if she wins the Democratic nomination? #KlobucharTownHall
@WalshFreedom https://t.co/b922Oh5hhp
@cantcatchme32 @ClayTravis Not really. Trump often says ignorant, baseless claims. There’s a reason fact-checkers have a field day with him.
@ggary59 Spoken like a true Trump cultist.
@ErikaLipton Spoken like a true Trump cultist.
@truthy_ty I think Trump cultists are more authoritarian and reactionary than they are conservative.
Andrew McCabe is a Republican in case you Trump cultists were oblivious. #60Minutes
In the first round of the 2019 racial draft, and as a proud member of the black delegation, we would like to trade Jussie Smollett for the beloved Leonardo DiCaprio. Thank you. https://t.co/5GmPH76wBL
@WalshFreedom There’s a reason I call Trump’s base “Cult 45.”
@Vipers_84 @ClayTravis You said “shocking that CNN would report anything that undermines the agenda,” so I included an example of a cable news outlet undermining its own agenda.
@rogerwoods962 @ClayTravis A free press is necessary for democracy. Americans who want restrictions on free press ought to move to an authoritarian country like China, Iran, North Korea, the Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia, or Venezuela and see how that works out for them.
@SarahRF88 @ClayTravis @CNN @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump does lie. Fact-checkers have a field day with him.
@LaddCaldwell @ClayTravis @SeanT_34 @FoxNews About Fox News and right-wing media in general from conservative Charlie Sykes https://t.co/MQeSbHAHRC
@Vipers_84 @ClayTravis It’d be akin to Fox News calling Donald Trump a terrible president.

@RiverRatSTL @NilsHeadley @ClayTravis I don’t know. But I do know that the energy sector prefers it and fracking over coal.
@RiverRatSTL @NilsHeadley @ClayTravis Coal mining jobs have been dying since the 1980s because of automation and market forces. The energy sector prefers fracking and natural gas over coal. https://t.co/CswV6Fh0jw
@RiverRatSTL @NilsHeadley @ClayTravis He said he’d “drain the swamp” but he has two Wall Street guys in his Cabinet and has a former coal lobbyist as his acting EPA administrator. 🤔
@RiverRatSTL @NilsHeadley @ClayTravis Tariffs hurt the consumer more than they help them. Plus, a trade deficit isn’t an indictment on the economy.
@RiverRatSTL @NilsHeadley @ClayTravis And, plus, you wouldn’t ask your plumber to do brain surgery, now would you?
@RiverRatSTL @NilsHeadley @ClayTravis I have a bachelor’s degree and I don’t regret going to university. It made me a better person and I wouldn’t have my current job without it.
@RiverRatSTL @NilsHeadley @ClayTravis And I don’t mean “cultist” as in Branch Davidians; I mean, “cult of personality.”		https://t.co/9hm5Mkx0Gi
@RiverRatSTL @NilsHeadley @ClayTravis Lol, I’m liberal but I’m not far-left. On social issues, I’m woke. On economic issues, I’m very moderate and pragmatic. I’m against tariffs, I support free trade, Medicare for All isn’t feasible, just to name some. I’m like Howard Schultz in a way.
@RiverRatSTL @NilsHeadley @ClayTravis What’s wrong with academia? I’ve read that white people without college degrees were more likely to vote for Donald Trump in 2016 than those who have degrees. 🤔
@RiverRatSTL @NilsHeadley @ClayTravis No offense but I can already tell you’re a Trump cultist because you’re calling moderate Republicans like John Kasich and Charlie Sykes “RINOs” just because they’re not Trump sycophants and aren’t infected with nativism, anti-intellectualism, or populist hysteria.
@RiverRatSTL @NilsHeadley @ClayTravis I mean, with all the cord-cutting going on, how else do you measure the popularity of news outlets?
@ericr13 @ClayTravis @jemelehill To this day, I’m still baffled by how Donald Trump survived all his scandals and became president. It’s insane.
@RiverRatSTL @NilsHeadley @ClayTravis Because Charlie Sykes is a cerebral, moderate Republican not affected by the polarization of our politics. He’s akin to John Kasich in that he calls balls and strikes. He doesn’t pander to the lowest common denominators in the GOP.		To wit: https://t.co/OvqFter7DS
@RiverRatSTL @NilsHeadley @ClayTravis Fox News is pretty influential and has been since its founding. Its Facebook page has 16 million likes. To put it in perspective, CNN has 31 million likes, MSNBC has 2.2 million likes, ABC News has 13 million likes, CBS News has 5.6 million likes, and NBC News has 9.9 million.
@NilsHeadley @RiverRatSTL @ClayTravis The right has Fox News (a.k.a. the Trump News Network), Breitbart, and what have you pushing their echo chamber. I would argue that right-wing media like Fox News is a safe space for Trump cultists. Even conservative commentator Charlie Sykes agrees with me.
@ericr13 @ClayTravis @jemelehill At this point, Kamala Harris has a better chance of becoming president than Jemele Hill resurrecting her career.
@polson24 @ClayTravis @realDonaldTrump Dude, don’t mention Reagan and Trump in the same sentence. Just don’t.
@ClayTravis @realDonaldTrump He didn’t mention the longest government shutdown that ended 10 days ago.

@Stacks30 @ClayTravis It’s too early to tell but I don’t see Cory Booker even getting the nomination. The Democrats need a candidate who can appeal to suburban voters because those voters will decide Trump’s fate. Urban voters generally vote blue while rural voters typically vote red.
@ClayTravis Cory Booker retweeting Shaun King would be no different than President Trump retweeting Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro, Tucker Carlson, etc.
