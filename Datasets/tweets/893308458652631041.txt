@shawniday @ceciliavpalmer @seanhannity The repair/construction of levies is Army Corps of Engineers budget which is part of DoD	The money doesn’t appear from nowhere, it’s taken from already planned projects like levies, dams, military housing, military base construction projects, military equipment maintenance, etc
@Raydog707 @kevenkelleher @Chicagofan76 @dbongino The money seized goes to the treasury and spending is at the discretion of congress - Article 1, Section 9	An executive order that violates the constitution is still unconstitutional and would be challenged in court.
@kevenkelleher @Raydog707 @Chicagofan76 @dbongino Most illegal fentanyl comes from China. 	Most drugs coming from Mexico come through points of entry - a wall won’t stop that. 	It is the duty of the congress to determine government spending, not the president’s - Article 1, Section 9
@RDASoccer @fuckthatseanguy @IronIngot2 @CarmenKHinton @dbongino @Scotus The DOJ and George Conway have already said he will lose. But do go on about how you are more well versed in constitutional law than the DOJ and one of the country’s leading constitutional lawyer (and Kellyanne’s husband)
@EFEvans3 @bengarciamusic @dbongino @POTUS What comes in my mail is a failure of customs AT A POINT OF ENTRY
@kevenkelleher @Raydog707 @Chicagofan76 @dbongino Actually, it’s only about $55 billion 		And why should the 65% of Americans who don’t want the wall have to pay for it when Mexico was supposed to?

@Raydog707 @Chicagofan76 @kevenkelleher @dbongino And it’s a damn shame he wants to take money meant to build and improve housing for active duty military and their families to build a wall. 		That’s not supporting our troops
@Raydog707 @Chicagofan76 @kevenkelleher @dbongino Nothing will be built anytime soon. 	And if it’s upheld, any president of any party can declare an emergency over anything	Population is an emergency - people can only have one child	Guns are an emergency - ban them	It’s a slippery slope
@ceciliavpalmer @shawniday @seanhannity Funny. I lived in SoCal about 30 minutes from the border and had no issues. My ex lives in AZ and the border is his property line. Also no problems. 🤷🏻‍♀️
@Raydog707 @Chicagofan76 @kevenkelleher @dbongino But this time it involves money. And per Article 1 Section 9, congress controls the purse strings. 	And it’s not just states that are suing.

@EFEvans3 @bengarciamusic @dbongino @POTUS And most of those migrants come through legal points of entry, as do most drugs. So why are miles and miles of a concrete wall necessary???	And why are American tax payers footing the bill when Mexico was supposed to?
@EFEvans3 @bengarciamusic @dbongino @POTUS Illegal border crossings are at the lowest they’ve been in 20 years. 	Do borders need to be open? Of course not. But there are much more effective means of border security than a wall that can’t even be built in someplaces because of terrain and in others because of lawsuits

@denise_coyle6 @SGibbie @MikeMil57933863 @seanhannity But it would be the precedent. 	Healthcare, gun control, climate change - all national emergencies. 	And since healthcare would be a national emergency, the new Dem president could take money from DHS and build Planned Parenthood’s!!!
@KatsWorld2 @seanhannity There no legitimate emergency. 	You can’t plan an emergency. 	It hasn’t been an emergency for the past 2 years	You don’t declare an emergency and then go golfing
@NeilHibben @seanhannity New funding bill says no wall can be built in AZ, CA, NM and parts of the Rio Grande Valley. 		If he signs and then declares an national emergency, he will be breaking the law he just signed to build anything there

@Tracy505 @chels562000 @Johnnyc10281 @seanhannity But eminent domain has to go through the courts if the land owners decide to sue. TX ranchers, CA, and PR have all said they will sue. Plus the bill says  no building in CA, NM, AZ and parts of the Rio Grande Valley https://t.co/NdE9tuQKh3

@alduk72 @Cruiser306 @seanhannity And he can’t take the political hit of another shutdown. 	He will declare his #FakeNationalEmergency, dozens of lawsuits will be filed and he will be out of office before it moves through the courts
@KelleyEnglish4 @seanhannity Won’t do any good. So many lawsuits will be filed, the “national emergency” would be on hold until all court cases are settled.
@kayrofl @chels562000 @Johnnyc10281 @seanhannity Actually, many people working illegally actually pay taxes but never file tax returns or get refunds - free money to the government		Because they don’t have social security numbers or green cards, they are NOT eligible for SNAP, CHIP, TANF, Medicaid, Medicare or SS

@alexcain33 @seanhannity If it’s a national emergency, you don’t sign an emergency declaration and then get on a plane to go golfing
@RileyhBFG @dbongino CA, PR, House Dems and a group of TX ranchers have lawsuits prepared. If a national emergency is declared, they’ll file suit which will halt the emergency declaration until all court cases are settled
@SandraD03475180 @dbongino If he doesn’t sign it, the government shuts down at midnight
@jamesmadison501 @dbongino They already approved it 83-17	Now it goes to Trump to sign. Congress already passed it and trump is signing it at 10:30 am in the Rose Garden.
@bengarciamusic @dbongino @POTUS That “stage” is declaring a national emergency which congress will vote to override. If they can’t get the votes, CA, PR, House Dems, and a group of ranchers in TX have all said they will sue	So the “national emergency” will be halted until it moves through the courts
@duckbil @dbongino Not possible. If not signed, government shuts down at midnight.

@ScarletAvengers @JoeforIndiana @SenDonnelly @SenToddYoung I had to jump in on that 		https://t.co/VhcLh3ggdJ
@jeff_sangl @SenDonnelly Not the way I would expect a pastor to speak to an elected official. 	 	I mean really, #WWJD???
Kanye has said that he has bipolar disorder and is unmedicated 	Having firsthand knowledge of how people act in a manic swing, this whole spectacle made me sad.		Sad that Kanye isn’t taking care of himself and angry that 🍄rump is taking advantage of it https://t.co/9nna4XU53r
@lrpa64 @AryaResists @senatemajldr @KidCasteel @ShuriResists @TrinityResists @dizzle5000 @SnowBiAuthor @StormResist @TrisResists @Rey_Sistance @debbiesideris And the other SC Senator is @LindseyGrahamSC 		Scott is better off hiding
RT @ScarletAvengers: Let’s go #Hoosiers ‼️ Y’all can do this, for #Indiana for #ThePeople for #AmericaUnited 		🔥💫 https://t.co/JPrl5mjgdi
@ScarletAvengers @JoeforIndiana @SenDonnelly If you want to be cheered up and have a laugh, you should see how absolutely brutal people are to our other Senator @SenToddYoung 		Because he is worthless.
So when 🍄rump brags about all the great things he has done for the country, the country he’s talking about is Brazil https://t.co/WceygwYz2n

@ScarletAvengers @JoeforIndiana @SenDonnelly I live in a small, rural town (less than 9k people), in a very red county. Lots of Trump signs in 2016 (plus it’s “Pence Country)	This year I have seen more signs for Donnelly and our Dem running for the House than any republican signs. 		#GivesMeHope
@debsicurn89 @StormResist @senatemajldr @KidCasteel @ShuriResists @TrinityResists @AryaResists @dizzle5000 @SnowBiAuthor @TrisResists @Rey_Sistance @debbiesideris I think that’s exactly what he’s saying

.@senatemajldr said, when asked about Republicans appealing to African American voters, “We have Tim Scott as a member of our caucus”		That’s #McTurtle’s version of “I’m not a racist because I have a black friend” https://t.co/mFCiLblX0F

@ScarletAvengers @SenDonnelly @BatmanResist @lfkraus @TrinityResists @CatWomanResists @JoeforIndiana 🔹He was essential in passing “Right to Try” legislation that gave terminal patients access to treatments that have not received FDA approval when they have exhausted all other treatment options
@ScarletAvengers @SenDonnelly @BatmanResist @lfkraus @TrinityResists @CatWomanResists I’m a Hoosier &amp;  cast my ballot for @JoeforIndiana today 	Things you don’t know unless you live here	🔹Joe is a HUGE advocate for mental health care &amp; believes we need more inpatient &amp; intensive outpatient facilities.
