@AOC What is a 'living wage?' At what level? Living at poverty, middle class, upper class? Who makes the determination what it is?
@AOC Great job Karly Marx!! Way to foment class warfare against the evil Bourgeoisie! Your plan is moving along nicely!

@CNN Oh no!!! Creepy Uncle Joe!  		Feel free to use that as a campaign slogan.
@amyklobuchar Ummm....not when Congress ceded the power to the Executive Branch in 1976. If you disagree with the President's order, pass a veto proof bill, otherwise you are just bloviating.
@TheDemocrats You all have already made it clear that you are not concerned with the safety of Americans by not fully funding a border wall. So please do not give us the fake condescension!
@SenatorDurbin A bit worried about your precious, liberal 9th circuit are you? BTW, remind me in the Constitution where it lays out the rules for a blue slip? Oh that's right, its not in there!
@SenJeffMerkley @EPA Well sir, if you are ever elected to the office of the Presidency, you can choose whoever you want.
@AOC BTW, please discuss how you are going to pay for this $93 Trillion mess? If you say, print more money like your associates say, then tell me what happens in 2030 when most economists believe the $ will be replaced as the reserve currency? Care to guess? Hyperinflation maybe?
@AOC I've read it and all of your other documents, including the Oopsie document on day one. I still think is a flaming pile of cow farts!
@AOC Okay, be honest. He's talking about your STATEMENTS!! BTW, I have read it, and your original FAQ's and then your watered down info. You did discuss farting cows and unwilling to work, remember? Also, how do you plan to pay for this $93 Trillion monstrosity?
@AOC has made it clear she will try to defund ICE. In a statement, she said until this injustice was corrected by allowing all to get free ICE at gas stations and supermarkets, she cannot see funding it. #AOC https://t.co/MDKFFZxamS
@RaychelTania Yeah, as soon as people realize it would give all of the power to NY and CA, they may think twice.
@SenJeffMerkley You are conflating the two. I think everyone agrees that healthcare is a right, that's why ER's cannot turn you away. Where many split is on how you pay for it. Medicare barely works now, how's it going to work for everyone?
@RaychelTania Yeah, unfortunately, it is legal. States can decide for themselves how to divide up their electoral votes. But watch them backpedal the first time a Republican wins the popular vote. They'll pull that back so quick!

@AOC Ummm...If you are taking from  your highest paid, to give your lowest paid a living wage (who decides what that is BTW), that is weal redistribution....a Marxist Ideal. Perhaps you should freshen up on your Karl Marx.
@AdamSchiff You're like a one trick pony aren't you? Giddy-Up Buttercup! üèá
@saikatc @sunrisemvmt @senatemajldr Is that urgency because you know that economists predict the $ will no longer be the reserve currency by 2030? After that the printing party is over, and so is your Marxist change agenda?
@FoxNews  - Possible motive for the 12 yr timeline for #AOC green new deal. https://t.co/IGuebpTeC0
Interesting correlation: @AOC says we have 12 years to get the #GND done through massive dollar printing. Many economist believe the $ will be replaced as the world reserve by 2030. (11-12 year range) Then the printing party for the US is over. ü§îRT pls! https://t.co/3GmnfFvE91
@saikatc This $32 T behemoth cannot even be compared to the $5 T of the past.  $ may be replaced as the reserve currency by 2030. That messes with your whole plan doesn't it. (hmm, I wonder if that's where your 12 yr deadline came from?) https://t.co/3GmnfFvE91

@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump And all of those jokes that you all call bills that you pass? It's an outline, wherein you tell the executive branch departments to "go write the rules on it." If you want control, you all need to get off your backsides and start writing specifics into laws!
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Actually, CONGRESS gave that ability away to the president in 1976 with the National Emergency Act.

@ewarren So I just don't see how we can foment this type of class warfare, when it is well reported that the top 10% in this country pay 2/3 rd of all income tax money collected? I fear this type of class warfare is being stoked via the Karl Marx formula. https://t.co/SDMjgvSgeX

@AOC This type of thing is indefensible. No one, regardless of political leaning, should have their safety put at risk! Unfortunately, both sides are doing it. Take the #JussieSmollet issue, this type of hoax does nothing but foment anger and possible violence.

@dbongino It is the only way to fit in their class warfare narrative. Trust me, they are working right out of the Marxist playbook. Before you can move to Socialism/Communism, you have to have the working class rise up. That won't happen, unless they are angry at the rich.
@TheDemocrats üòÇ...okay, if you say so.
@DeanObeidallah Some of us believe there is an emergency. Would you be willing to have illegal immigrants in the MS-13 gang bussed into your neighborhood? We don't like it either, and want it stopped. That by no way means we have chosen anything BUT our country.
@AOC That's their income tax, and believe me I agree you all in congress need to cut the loopholes. But you have to admit Congresswoman, they certainly would have paid property taxes in NY. Those 25,000 workers would have paid income tax, property, sales, etc.

@SenFeinstein Can we bus illegal immigrants to your neighborhood? Easy to say there's no emergency when you know it won't affect you and your family.

@ewarren Could we have MS-13 gang members who are illegal aliens come stay at your house? 		The reason you don't think it's an emergency is because the illegal immigrants aren't being bussed into your community.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Or,maybe it was because he thought he could work with a common sense Congress to get bipartisan support. That apparently didn't happen, not because you all care about a wall, but because there are still hurt feelings about an election that you thought you had in the bag.

@SenWhitehouse You all are being so disingenuous! A refund is the amount you overpaid the government. Because withholdings were adjusted DOWN, we all didn't overpay as much!! We still got tax relief, we just didn't LOAN as much to the federal government.

@katiecannon2 @rch371 @AOC @saikatc @newconsensus Nice try diverting the conversation; I'm quite done with economics for tonight. My original request was for you to backup your blanket statement that Tucker, "always lies," and then you went on to try move this into an economics debate. Not doing it.
@katiecannon2 @rch371 @AOC @saikatc @newconsensus Again, does nothing to prove to me that Tucker Carlson, "always lies."
@katiecannon2 @rch371 @AOC @saikatc @newconsensus hahaha....I get that you are trying to stretch as hard as possible to back up your statement that he, "always lies." But you have yet to give any concrete proof to back your assertion. You've focused on one clip where his opinion differs from yours, but that's it.
@katiecannon2 @rch371 @AOC @saikatc @newconsensus Again, not a lie; That's a question. Again focus; where did he say "X" when X is clearly not the truth?
@katiecannon2 @rch371 @AOC @saikatc @newconsensus Lets try and focus. Tucker has an opinion on the economy. You do not agree with that opinion. That, by no means, makes it a lie. If you‚Äôd like to offer an example of where he actually lied, I would be happy to continue this conversation. Otherwise have a wonderful evening üòä
@katiecannon2 @rch371 @AOC @saikatc @newconsensus So those are a difference in opinion, in philosophy. I still don‚Äôt see how that was a lie. The government exists, only because we allow it to; we created it. Therefore, the government does not own anything, we do. But again, I‚Äôm looking for what he said that was a lie.
@katiecannon2 @rch371 @AOC @saikatc @newconsensus I‚Äôm sorry, but you still have not convinced me that Tucker Carlson,  ‚Äúlies all the time.‚Äù You have yet to cite an example of him saying something (not fox, Tucker) that was anything other than a semantical interpretation by you. So please, give me an exact quote where he lied.
@katiecannon2 @rch371 @AOC @saikatc @newconsensus Again, What lie did Tucker tell that is not a Semantic interpretation?
@katiecannon2 @rch371 @AOC @saikatc @newconsensus Again...What lie did Tucker tell that is not a Semantic interpretation?
@katiecannon2 @rch371 @AOC @saikatc @newconsensus Slow down Kathryn, you are going to pop a vessel. What lie did Tucker tell that is not a Semantic interpretation?
@katiecannon2 @rch371 @AOC @saikatc @newconsensus hahahaha....are you writing a textbook? Again, the Government's fiat currency is only worth something because of the GDP right? So they trade OUR labor for value. Therefore, the government does not have any value without us. Thus what Tucker said in an easier term.
@katiecannon2 @rch371 @AOC @saikatc @newconsensus Yes, very good. We've both taken economic courses. Again, your argument is based on a Semantic interpretation. Can you give me a concrete lie that Tucker has told? (i.e. "The sky is black.")
@katiecannon2 @rch371 @AOC @saikatc @newconsensus So you are arguing semantics to prove a point that Tucker lies, which is not true. Can you give me an example of a lie that is not a Semantic argument?
@katiecannon2 @rch371 @AOC @saikatc @newconsensus Well I don't really want to get into an economic debate. You said that Tucker says the government doesn't have any money itself. That is true. They only have it because we accept the currency of our government. They need our labor to uphold the GDP to make it worth something.
@katiecannon2 @rch371 @AOC @saikatc @newconsensus This neo economic theory only works if the world supports our fiat currency. If they don't, then our government can just print us into hyper inflation, as in the Weinmar Republic in the 1920s, or Venezuela today.
@katiecannon2 @rch371 @AOC @saikatc @newconsensus And BTW, if the world decides to move to another currency as their reserve, we will instantly become buried under the weight of our debt.
@katiecannon2 @rch371 @AOC @saikatc @newconsensus Oh there's no doubt the government creates the money. But it's a 'fiat' currency, meaning it backed by nothing but the credit of the Government. If 'we the people' decided it was not worth it's weight, then them printing money would be worth nothing.
@katiecannon2 @rch371 @AOC @saikatc @newconsensus So, definitely not a lie on Tucker's part. Can you give me another specific example?
@katiecannon2 @rch371 @AOC @saikatc @newconsensus Well both statements are correct. The government does print money that we use. They, however, did not trade labor to get that money back from us, they require us to give some back based on the laws. And if you know anything about inflation, you will know that it is a silent tax.
@SenSanders I can't believe this, but I actually agree with you. I believe that all that are legally able to vote in the US, should be automatically registered to vote, when they sign up for Selective Service. (That would require a change to require females to sign up.)

@brianschatz Withholding rules changed,thus more money was being left in people's checks. Of course the refund will not be the same, they didn't pay the same amount in. BTW, if you are used to always getting a refund, you have been giving the government an interest free loan. How's that feel?

@KamalaHarris Also, and don't take this wrong, I'm all for helping middle class and lower families, but how many of those at or below $100,000 have revolving credit card debt? Cable TV? A brand new $30,000 car? You don't have to be $500 away from bankruptcy if you live within your means.
@KamalaHarris So the minimum wage was NEVER enough to support that. 35 years ago when I was working for minimum wage, I would not have been able to afford my own apartment. Minimum wage is entry level, it's not meant to support you. It's a launching pad to move into those living wage jobs.

@dncpress And the Dems are unconcerned with their open border stance that creates a magnate that causes them to be detained. Why don't we secure the border, stop the inflow, then open a door wide for LEGAL migration?
@AOC @mvmtschool That'd be really exciting if they developed education on helping people back into the workforce, rather than 'grass-roots organizing.'
@maziehirono Actually all he did was side with not blocking the legislation from being implemented while the case was decided in court. Much different than saying he was for it.
@SenSanders I don't know, I'm none of those things and I'm pretty happy with our system. I was much happier before Obamacare drove my premiums through the roof though.
@KamalaHarris Scarcity of workers drives up wages. If your side would help close the border, and stop farmers from using illegal migrants, wages would necessarily increase. They won't increase wages until workers are harder to come by.

@MarsInsider @MoffittJill @Tdactl @JacksonLeeTX18 @HouseJudiciary @MattWhitaker46 Absolutely, and before cameras, I imagine these hearing were a bit more productive. Now, they are looking for soundbites. Some of the questions asked were delving into the arena of ludicrous.
@MarsInsider @MoffittJill @Tdactl @JacksonLeeTX18 @HouseJudiciary @MattWhitaker46 We could go back through the past 20 or 30 years and site many instances where the Democrats acted in much the same way (first thing that comes to mind is HRC, "At this point, what does it matter."), I don't remember any condemnation from the Democrats when that happened.
@MarsInsider @MoffittJill @Tdactl @JacksonLeeTX18 @HouseJudiciary @MattWhitaker46 And, BTW, both sides do it.
@BeckyIB I believe he was as respectful to them as they were to him. It‚Äôs grandstanding; they threatened him with a subpoena when he already said he was coming. Why? Grandstanding for their base. Give respect, get respect.
@MarsInsider @MoffittJill @Tdactl @JacksonLeeTX18 @HouseJudiciary @MattWhitaker46 Constitutional oversight is absolutely needed under any administration. The true work is done by congressional investigators behind the scenes. These televised open hearings are grandstanding designed to create gotcha sound bites.
@MarsInsider @MoffittJill @Tdactl @JacksonLeeTX18 @HouseJudiciary @MattWhitaker46 I disagree. The world is not black or white. We live in the grey where very few thing are yes/no without caveats. And when it was your side sitting in that chair, you all said the same thing. Let‚Äôs at least be intellectually honest with ourselves.
@skeptictrader @Ilhan McDonalds entry level consists of a couple days training. CEO takes years to get your MBA, then many more working your way up. No comparison.
@Gywair @asmilefixer @fleccas @RealDeanCain @Ilhan I know kids working these jobs (kid being the important word), where a couple of them share an apartment, and they live just fine. They are going to school so they can eventually make a living wage on their own. Think entry level.
@Ilhan McDonalds frontline is an entry level job. The skills needed for it are taught in a day or two. It was never intended as a career.
@AOC And the Democrats have never done that right? Perfect little angels a lot of you.

@laxshinigami @Obsidian065 @AOC Okay....hahaha
@laxshinigami @Obsidian065 @AOC I always laugh when people resort to personal attacks. It means they've got nothing else, and are not winning the discussion. Hey, have a great day! I don't hate you, nor do I think that you are an idiot. Just someone that thinks differently than me.
@laxshinigami @Obsidian065 @AOC Sorry, misread your tweet the first time. So you are probably one of those who think 'flipping burgers is intended to be a lifetime career.' I personally believe that entry level jobs are not intended to be a living wage career, but rather a stepping stone to a real career.
@laxshinigami @Obsidian065 @AOC Hey if your community can already absorb those extra people, then good on you. It's more work on the back of the existing workers, so maybe they are currently overstaffed, or you are just going to be asking people to do more work for the same pay. But good on you.
@Obsidian065 @laxshinigami @AOC That's cool. As I've said you all do you. Other communities would love to have the additional jobs. Perhaps those that don't get jobs in NY will move to those communities that do have the jobs. Then you all don't have to worry about those "Low Wage" eyesores.
@Obsidian065 @laxshinigami @AOC Also, to maintain 25000 more people, local government has to hire more teachers, more garbage collectors, more police, fire, etc. to help those 25000 additional taxpayers. This is just basic economy folks.
@Obsidian065 @laxshinigami @AOC Of course, but that Janitor might like a job too. And....basic economy info, those 25000 have to shop, eat, be housed, etc. To support 25000 more people, business have to hire more workers....more jobs created.
@laxshinigami @Obsidian065 @AOC Try to stay with me...economy 101. So those 25000 people have to eat right? Where do they get their food?....stores right? Stores have to support more people now, so they have to hire more workers. BINGO---Job created. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.
@Obsidian065 @laxshinigami @AOC May be a drop to you, but not the people who would have work because of it. I'm betting it's a pretty big deal to them.

@RepMarkMeadows This does not have anything to do with climate. That's the pretext for an attempted socialist takeover of the United States! Let's all call it what it is.
@laxshinigami @AOC Oh it is how it works. Do you think 25,000 new people pay local taxes..yep. Do you think the additional jobs that are created to serve those new people pay local taxes..yep again. New jobs, mean more new jobs, mean more local taxes paid. I bet those potholes get taken care of.
@laxshinigami @AOC Thanks for the advice! I'm sure areas enjoying millions of dollars of inflow from employment salaries and ancillary jobs created to serve those Amazon workers, will find a way around it.
@laxshinigami @AOC hahahaha....okay. Cool.
@laxshinigami @AOC Hey, it's all good. You guys do you! There are many other places that will take those jobs gladly.
@laxshinigami @AOC So 25,000 jobs....whether they are new or not; would they not buy goods in that area? Would they not buy homes? Spend discretionary money? Unless you know nothing of how economics work, you can see 25,000 employees is a plus for any area.
@AOC I read it directly from your link yesterday. I still see it for what it is, an attempted Socialist takeover of the United States.
@AOC I am just shocked...literally my jaw is on the floor. I have never, in my life seen a politician cheer a business deciding NOT to bring jobs to their state! Wow! Just Wow!
@CoryBooker Senator Booker, please be honest with the people, whose votes you want, this is not a Green Deal, this is a Socialist takeover of the United States.

@Reuters @AOC It is an attempted Socialist takeover of our country. In the short term, this will never get any traction, but it definitely opens the door to debate. Do we want a socialist country like Venezuela, or do we want to continue with what has made us the wealthiest country on earth?
@SenGillibrand I totally get the woman's right, what boggles my mind as a caring human though, is the rights of an an unborn, human, American Citizen. We have to be honest and see that abortion, in most cases, is being used as birth control. Death for convenience! What is wrong with us?
@AOC The way fox did this was in poor taste. The fact remains that ICE enforces the laws that are on the books, this includes trying to keep scum like this guy out of our country. You want to get rid of ICE. If you don't like their detention policies change the law Congresswoman.
@linnymarie4 @maziehirono So again I would ask, how is debating a senators statements in the public discourse being an a$$hole? Isn't this what democracy is about? Or is it only okay to disagree with some politicians, but not others? I did not call her a name and I did not defame her.
@linnymarie4 @maziehirono Where exactly have I been an a$$hole? So having an opinion, and speaking it makes me an a$$hole? Being part of the public discourse with politicians makes me an a$$hole? I have not been rude to anyone on here. I have not disparaged anyone. Please back up your assertion.

@SenSanders You know what I would like to see Senator....to have Congress push for getting rid of the Federal Reserve! That is the largest theft and covert tax on a group of people in history. Inflation was a non-event before. Now a 2%+ tax(inflation) on our money?!? Get rid of it!!
@erikfinman We also need to reeducate people on spending at the lower end. It amazes me how many people who win the lottery are broke again within just a few years. Being wealthy is as much about your spending as it is your income. (i.e. my USPS worker grandfather that retired a millionaire.
@MaraGay I think this is a great mea culpa. I do believe in my heart that he is truly sorry, and has changed his ways. The problem now is the loss of public trust. That's a very hard thing to overcome, and requires most public officials to resign and work on building that trust again.

@KamalaHarris hmmmm...let me see....$32.6 TRILLION in additional government spending over 10 years for medicare for all according to Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Less choice, longer waits, shoddy healthcare. No thanks, I'll keep what I've got.
@TheDemocrats I'm wondering if politicians will change their mind on this when it finally dawns on them that they are killing future voters?
@MattSterba @TheDemocrats Great tweet. I would also point out that during A &amp; B this little human being most likely feels pain because they are still alive. Imagine being dismembered alive! Gruesome, sickening, immoral!
@AOC Well since Congress writes the laws, hop on the keyboard and put something forward.
Well said! https://t.co/rTIn2Nv5mY
@SenGillibrand LMAO!!! Says the pot to the kettle!
@RepAdamSchiff Thank you. We expect you to do your oversight job. (All Americans) What we don't expect you to do is launch a litany of investigations because you just don't like someone, or because your feelings are still hurt for losing an election.
@SenSanders ummmm....because it is mostly flailing in those countries? Just my guess. From what I understand medicare for all is estimated to cost 7 trillion over ten years. You can yell "the rich will pay," all you want, but it really means higher taxes for all.
@Amy_Siskind @AOC that should have said Trump backs deregulating, backs 2nd amendment, backs free market economy.
@Amy_Siskind @AOC that should have said Trump backs deregulating, backs 2nd amendment, backs free market economy.
@Amy_Siskind @AOC Def. of Authoritarian: favoring or enforcing strict obedience to authority, especially that of the government, at the expense of personal freedom.	- Deregulating	- backs 2nd Amendmant 	- backs free market economy	I do not think that word means what you think that word means.
@mcevasco But that doesn't fit your narrative, so you will never admit to being disingenuous.
@mcevasco Yep, that's the % of it that is seized. Of course it's high at the POE's, that's where the best security is. But with the amount of those drugs on the street, that tells me there is a boatload not being seized, and logical reasoning tells you it's not coming through POEs
@SenFeinstein I remember how the Dems acted on this and fixed it when you held the white house and both houses! That was great!  Oh wait.....

@JimGorski2 @_OldWhig_ @SenSanders Health insurance explains it! Customers have no idea how much their healthcare actually costs. If you took health insurance out-of-the-way, and people had to pay out-of-pocket, market forces would drive those prices down extremely fast!
@SenSanders Healthcare insurance is part of the problem. If patients saw how much treatment actually cost, market forces would drive the price down. But because we‚Äôve allowed all costs to be hidden behind insurance, they know they can charge whatever they want!
@dorisdunning @kath2060 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump My fix, in case anyone cares-and I'm not even sure I do-, term limits for all. Stop the 'politician for life' problem in our country.
@dorisdunning @kath2060 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump You are right, lying is indefensible. And BTW, Obama got his plethora of pinocchio during his tenure. I think what is disingenuous is to remain silent when it's your side, then lose your pants when it's the other. The hypocrisy is strong in some.
@TamponsForTrump @SenGillibrand Yes, more people, you are right. The point that was missed here (sorry if it was aimed too high) is that the Senate is a much more powerful body in congress. Think 'Advice and Consent.' So if you, as president are going to keep one, it's much more advantageous to keep the Senate.
@kath2060 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Oh and meant to commend you, or someone, on the focus it must have taken to count up over 8000. Wow, that's a lot of counting....must have a lot of time on their hands!
@kath2060 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Are any lies okay? Even one? BTW, ALL politicians lie, it's what they do. It's a personality disorder. This type of person is drawn to either politics, or used car sales. But to kid ourselves into thinking that one side lies, and the other doesn't well, that's lying to ourselves.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Remember when Trump came to the house and looked us in the eye and said, "If you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it?" Oh wait....
@SpeakerPelosi @HouseJudiciary I liked the days when the Dems held both houses and the white house, and they fixed it then!  Oh wait.....dang

@KamalaHarris So since walls, fences, barriers (whatever you want to call them) are ‚Äòuseless,‚Äô when should we expect congress to start pushing for their removal from all prisons? (Im assuming you would sponsor or co-sponsor) They are such an eyesore.
@KamalaHarris OMG!! KH and I agree on something??  Oh and BTW, the answer to our healthcare problem are not on the insurance side, they are on the cost side. But politicians don‚Äôt want the people to know that right?
@KamalaHarris We‚Äôll just have Axel Rose tell those babies, ‚Äúbaby, your gonna die!‚Äù Oh sorry, forgot ...üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª

@KamalaHarris Democracy can only be saved with a 7 trillion dollar Medicare for all plan! You go get ‚Äòem!
@SenSanders I‚Äôm betting the millions of people with new jobs since Trump took office think it‚Äôs pretty hot! Or wait, would that be ‚Äòcool?‚Äô I‚Äôm confused now....let‚Äôs say they are happy!
@SenatorBennet I see what you did there...speech...paper..hehe. Funny GDP at a high not seen under Obama, record low unemployment, lowest unemployment ever in the African American communities. But that‚Äôs just for his base right?
@SenatorBennet Funny, every indicator I‚Äôve seen shows wages going up over the last two years. ‚ÄòMember when that happened under Obama? Oh wait...

@StephenAtHome There was one day you were funny (It may have been a Sunday....or Monday), but that's been many, many years ago. Sorry bro, it sucks to lose your talent. :(
@CoryBooker As the king of identity politics, I guess you would know. Of course, we all know that no one can do it better than you. Keep up the divisive work comrade!
@SenGillibrand He knows he created jobs, and he still has the Senate.....so there's that.
