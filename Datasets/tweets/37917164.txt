@ThePlumLineGS I think voters knew EXACTLY what tax hikes he wanted. The specifics of his budget cuts and Medicare reforms, not so much.
@ThePlumLineGS He campaigned on "general principles." Thanks. My point exactly.
@ThePlumLineGS Sorry, Greg, but tipping your hat to a fiscal plan is not the same as campaigning on it. He paid lip service, nothing more.
