A strong labor movement is the single best way to help workers. As the share of workers in a union and the number of strikes have fallen, so has the share of income going to the bottom 90 percent of households. https://t.co/azLYzdmHBV
The good news is 2018 was an excellent year for labor. More workers are using their collective bargaining power and going on strike than in a few decades. The bad news is union strength pales in comparison to decades past. https://t.co/FfLfFrTicH
These losses add up over time. It's not just $8,556 in 2015. It's also $8,286 in 2014, etc.		Due to the increase in inequality, the average household in the bottom 99% that worked from 2010-2015 is out nearly $45,000. Those that worked from 1990-2015 are out more than $145,000. https://t.co/VjFJdXunUh
The richest's greed comes at a direct cost to workers. Because they're taking more &amp; more of the pie, money that should be flowing to workers instead is taken by the rich.		If inequality hadn't grown, the average household in the bottom 99% would've earned $8,556 more in 2015. https://t.co/VYP8K48mZ0
The richest Americans have been eating up more and more of the total income in the country.		In 1979, the top 1 percent took home 10.1 percent of all income.		By 2015, that had nearly doubled, reaching 18.6 percent. https://t.co/JFz0Ppklb4
Union members earn $1,051 a week on average compared to $860 for non-members. But new data out today show union membership is barely half of what it was 35 years ago. 		To increase workers’ wages, we must strengthen unions and restore bargaining power to workers. https://t.co/s72dYZ827V
Senate Republicans today introduced a bill to prevent future shutdowns.		Their plan: Massive, automatic cuts to essential programs like Head Start, WIC, and LIHEAP. https://t.co/dwzNALKke9
Tax cuts for the wealthy – in addition to a decline in union strength – have caused egregious levels of income inequality. 		We must ensure both the economy and the tax code work for everyone, not just the richest among us. https://t.co/jaJa23d1uI
The US tax code used to tax the richest much, much more than it does now. Research shows high taxes on the richest decreases pre-tax income inequality, ensuring money instead flows to workers.		It's not a radical idea to tax the millionaires and billionaires the way we used to. https://t.co/1tnbFjmFEt

We may all have our disagreements, but it is disappointing that the GOP refuses to give us a forum to discuss them.
The Budget Comm. has an important institutional role, and fulfilling it requires coordination between the exec. and legislative branches.
This decision runs counter to repeated calls by the majority for regular order in the Senate.
It is disappointing that the majority talks so much about government dysfunction, and ignores one of our primary responsibilities.
In the history of the Committee, no matter who was in the majority or the White House, we have always analyzed the President’s request.
It is outrageous that the Republican majority on the Budget Committee refuses to hold a hearing on the President’s budget.

Murray: If we want to fulfill our responsibility to leave behind a strong fiscal foundation, &amp; a safe &amp; healthy environment – we must act
Murray: Curbing emissions to prevent the more severe impacts &amp; adapting to the impacts that we can’t avoid are our lowest cost options
Murray: Anyone who wants to tackle our long-term fiscal challenges fairly &amp; responsibly, needs also to worry about climate change impacts
Murray: Failing to act now makes it more difficult to solve the problem later &amp; will force us to divert resources away from other priorities
Murray:  The impacts of climate change will have major implications for our nation’s economy and budget #ActOnClimate #BudgetHearing
Murray: Climate change will increase the resources our military will need to meet new challenges, maintain readiness &amp; carry out its mission

#BudgetHearing: Consideration of OMB Director Nominee Shaun Donovan http://t.co/DlRnMhCUsA
Murray: Because these goals are so important, I am hopeful Secretary Donovan’s confirmation process will be a smooth and efficient one
Murray: Making investments in jobs &amp; opportunity and tackling long-term budget challenges would help families &amp; workers for decades to come
Murray: I am confident we can get this done. The budget deal proved that neither side is willing to accept sequestration as the status quo
Murray: We need invest appropriately in those areas. For FY2016 that means we will need to find a way to roll back sequestration again
Murray: Long-term debt is a threat to our economy, but so are a poorly educated workforce, inadequate infrastructure, &amp; dampened innovation
Murray: The two-year budget deal was a step in the right direction. But looking forward to fiscal year 2016, we must build on it together
Murray: Our fiscal outlook has improved significantly in the near term, but we still face serious debt challenges that we need to address
Murray: He will bring these strengths to OMB at a critical time. Although we have made progress, there is a lot more to do
Murray: Donovan has also been a highly effective &amp; responsive partner on the issue of disaster relief– an area that transcends party lines
Murray: He’s worked in a bipartisan manner to ensure the nation continues to have a strong, durable, affordable housing market going forward
Murray: Donovan led @HUDgov through the process of stabilizing the housing market, &amp; took steps to keep responsible families in their homes
Murray: It is clear Donovan is focused on strengthening our middle class by expanding opportunity for families &amp; communities
Murray: President Obama made a strong choice in nominating Secretary Donovan to the OMB. We've worked closely together over the past 5 years

Murray: Higher Ed is more critical than ever to America's long-term competitiveness. A college degree shouldn’t drown borrowers in debt
Murray: Passing the Bank on Student Emergency Loan Refinancing Act would put more money in borrowers’ pockets, so they can make ends meet
Murray: We need to ensure that student loan servicers are treating borrowers fairly and responsibly #BudgetHearing #DegreesNotDebt
Murray: Paying off student loans can prevent young people from saving for retirement, or making purchases that help the economic recovery
Murray: Student loan debt can stifle entrepreneurship. Young people who want to start their own businesses aren’t able to take the risk
Murray: High monthly bills to pay back student loans can disqualify many people from getting a mortgage #BudgetHearing #DegreesNotDebt
Murray: There is mounting evidence that student debt is also holding back the economy #BudgetHearing #DegreesNotDebt
Murray: Americans who took out school loans can find it difficult to save and accumulate wealth #BudgetHearing #DegreesNotDebt

Murray: Expanding economic opportunity to women is the right thing to do,  and an economic necessity  for families and the broader economy.

Murray: We must build on &amp; strengthen Social Security w/ policies to make it easier for women &amp; their families to build a secure retirement
Murray: We should recognize challenges working parents face, &amp; put in place a set of policies that help them at work and home #budgethearing
Murray: We need to update our tax code so that mothers returning to the workforce don’t face a marriage penalty
Murray: We need to do more to ensure women get equal pay for equal work &amp; raise the minimum wage to help the millions of women earning it
Murray: We took a good step forward with the #ACA, which prevents companies from charging women more than men for coverage #budgethearing
Murray: Women need to have an equal shot at success. We must end unfair practices that set women back financially #fairshot #budgethearing

Murray: Our witness @HBoushey found that between 1979 &amp; 2012, the U.S. economy grew by almost 11% due to women joining the labor force
Murray: As working families have felt more strained, women’s economic contributions have made a difference— to family budgets &amp; the economy
Murray: One of the most significant economic shifts has eased some of the burden: the increasing participation of women in the workforce
Murray: Our economy has seen a lot of changes in the last few decades: Too many middle class jobs moving overseas, &amp; a widening income gap

Murray: The budget deal showed that when both parties come ready to compromise, we can take sensible steps to address economic challenges
Murray: In this more stable budget environment, I hope Congress will be able to work together to encourage job creation and growth
Murray: If we take this balanced approach, I strongly believe our economic growth will be stronger and more broadly felt
Murray: We need to protect our economy by phasing in deficit reduction over time, rather than allowing deep and immediate cuts
Murray: We need to address deficits in education, innovation, infrastructure &amp; research which are critical to job creation &amp; economic growth
Murray: Let's build on the Bipartisan Budget Act &amp; work together on a balanced approach to create jobs and growth &amp; tackle the deficit
Murray: Economists &amp; experts have noted that fiscal austerity, like sequestration cuts, have hurt our recovery, slowed growth &amp; cost jobs
Murray: Taking a responsible approach to our budget challenges is critical to encouraging economic growth
Murray: We need to get more Americans back to work &amp; encourage economic growth that leads to higher-wage jobs and a stronger middle class
Murray: There is still more work to do- far too many have dropped out of the labor force, or are stuck struggling in part time jobs
Murray: More workers are getting back on the job &amp; the unemployment rate has declined to its lowest level since September 2008
Murray: Thanks in no small part to the work of the Fed, our economy is much stronger than it was 5 years ago when the Great Recession hit

Murray: Students at every stage of their learning, from preschool to college &amp; career training, deserve a quality education #budgethearing
Murray: I believe getting a college degree shouldn’t be as cost-prohibitive to so many families, as it is today #budgethearing
Murray: Expanding apprenticeship programs would help train workers in skills businesses need &amp; would help workers secure middle class jobs
Murray: We need strong K-12 schools to make sure our kids can compete in a global economy. Starting w/ basic skills like reading and writing
Murray: Early learning shouldn’t be a partisan issue &amp; I hope Republicans will support legislation to expand high-quality preschool programs
Murray: As a former preschool teacher I’ve seen firsthand how early learning can give kids a strong foundation  #budgethearing
Murray: We need to look at ways to build on the budget deal- focusing on bipartisan areas of investment like education &amp; workforce training
Murray: Failing to make important investments in education can weaken opportunities for Americans &amp; hinders our ability to lead in the world
Murray: As we struggle to prepare our students, other countries are gaining a significant, &amp; potentially lasting, advantage. #budgethearing
Murray: We are facing an education deficit – college is becoming more unaffordable &amp; schools are struggling to prepare students for success

Murray: In this economy, we can't afford to pass up changes to our tax code that help workers and families in a fiscally responsible way
Murray: We should also be looking at wasteful loopholes when it comes to addressing the looming Highway Trust Find shortfall
Murray: The 21st Century Worker Tax Cut Act would close corporate loopholes that Democrats &amp; Republicans have proposed eliminating
Murray: This bill would close wasteful, unfair tax loopholes to help workers and families keep more of what they earn
Murray: The 21st Century Worker Tax Cut Act I've introduced is an important reform that would update the tax code to help workers &amp; families
Murray: I think it’s time for both parties to come together to find ways to make the tax code fairer for families
Murray: Giving tax breaks to millionaires, while doing nothing to help working families keep more of what they own is deeply unfair
Murray: The House GOP Budget would push the top tax rate to 25%. Middle class families would pick up the tab for new tax cuts for the rich
Murray: Tax reform that doesn’t ask the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to pay their fair share is fiscally irresponsible
Murray: We are spending a lot of money wasteful giveaways to those who don’t need them, instead of investing in families who do
Murray: Inefficiency and unfairness in our tax code is actually making things worse
Murray: Changes to our tax code can’t solve the problem alone, but tax reform should be a tool in the fight
Murray: While earnings have risen for the top one percent, earnings for the middle class have stayed stagnant or even declined
Murray: Our country has seen many changes in recent decades – including a widening gap between those at the top &amp; everyone else

Murray: Last week I introduced the 21st Century Worker Tax Cut Act, which would help today’s workers &amp; families keep more of what they earn
Murray: Congress can and should act to ensure that hard work pays off by raising the minimum wage for millions of workers #RaiseTheWage
Murray: Congress can create conditions so that all Americans, from the top earners, to the middle class, to those struggling can succeed
Murray: The economy thrives when the middle class can earn enough to raise a family, save for college &amp; put money away for retirement
Murray: Stagnant economic mobility and soaring inequality are not inevitable, we can expand opportunity to more Americans #budgethearing

Murray: Updating our tax code to give tax breaks to struggling workers - instead of big corporations is the right thing to do
Murray: The 21st Century Worker Tax Cut Act would put in place a new tax deduction to help struggling families keep more of what they earn
Murray: This bill would be paid for by closing wasteful loopholes both Democrats and Republicans have proposed eliminating
Murray: The 21st Century Worker Tax Cut Act would complement raising the minimum wage – providing tax cuts designed for today’s workforce
Murray: Today, too many are left behind by our outdated tax code. We must expand #EITC &amp; update the tax code to reflect today’s workforce
Murray: Policies like the #EITC have helped lift millions out of poverty &amp; there has been bipartisan support to expand it in the past
Murray: As we look for ways to expand opportunity for struggling workers &amp; families, we should use every tool– including the tax code
Murray: There are many steps we can take to tackle the barriers workers and families face. We should start by raising the minimum wage.

Murray: There are important opportunities to build on that bipartisan foundation by encouraging growth &amp; job creation through the tax code
Murray: We have big differences between our parties on tax reform, but we saw w/ the budget deal that we can come together on tough choices
Murray: There is bipartisan support for the EITC &amp; for closing certain loopholes. I hope my GOP colleagues will work with us
Murray: The Earned Income Tax Credit lifts millions of Americans out of poverty each year by rewarding work, and it should be expanded
Murray: We are spending a lot of money on wasteful giveaways to those who don’t need them, instead of investing in families who do
Murray:  These tax breaks are skewed to benefit the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations who need them the least
Murray: Our tax code is riddled with wasteful loopholes and special-interest carve-outs.
Murray: As we look to get more Americans back to work &amp; bring down long term debt, we must look at the tax code. Right now it is in the way
Murray:  We have to do everything we can to get more people back on the job, and to build broad based economic growth now and in the future

Murray: The President’s #budget is a strong proposal for a long term plan to build on our two year budget deal.
Murray: #budget proposal also upholds #immigration reform as a way to tackle deficits. Immigration reform is good for families &amp; the economy
Murray: Our tax code is riddled with wasteful loopholes, and special interest carve-outs. It would be unfair to ignore every one of them
Murray: The President’s #budget would generate new revenue by eliminating some back-door spending, which benefits the wealthiest individuals
Murray: I’m glad to see this budget maintains the commitment to a national preschool initiative, helping our youngest children &amp; the economy
Murray: We must tackle long term deficits, but we have breathing room to focus on deficits in jobs, innovation, infrastructure, &amp; education

Murray: We need a credible plan to reduce spending responsibly; raising revenue by closing wasteful loopholes &amp; investing in our economy
Murray: We would be doing families today, and the next generation a great disservice if we allow these deficits to grow #budgethearing
Murray: We have a serious jobs deficit and a serious opportunity deficit #budgethearing
Murray: Our roads &amp; bridges are crumbling, investments aren’t being made in education &amp; jobs, innovation &amp; research has been scaled back
Murray: It is unfair to protect every egregious tax loophole, while asking seniors and families to bear the burden of the deficit alone
Murray: We need a balanced approach to tackle our deficit – one that reduces spending and raises new revenue fairly and responsibly
Murray: Less discretionary spending also threatens efforts to care for service members, veterans, and their families
Murray: The decline in discretionary spending is alarming because it means less investment in job growing areas like innovation &amp; technology
Murray: While we are moving in the right direction, Congress can and must do more to boost economic recovery #budgethearing
Murray: We need to ensure every family has the opportunity to succeed &amp; also address long-term fiscal challenges fairly and responsibly
Murray: Look fwd to House GOP sending over a #debtlimit bill with no ransom demands attached.

Murray: I hope Republicans give up their #debtlimit demands, raise the debt ceiling w/ no strings attached, &amp; work w/ us on real challenges
Murray: The longer Republicans take to dream up empty #debtlimit demands, the more economic uncertainty and harm they will cause
Murray: Secretary Lew had an important message yesterday: time is running out #debtlimit
Murray: Just when we have the opportunity to make progress, some members of Congress are planning to manufacture a crisis #debtlimit
Murray: Divided government requires Dems &amp; Republicans to work together. It’s the only way to solve problems &amp; help families &amp; businesses
Murray: We need to make investments to expand access to preschool. The path to greater opportunity starts with quality education
Murray: We need to get to work. For starters, we should #RaiseTheWage to help families make ends meet and expand opportunities
Murray: Families are struggling today, workers are fighting to get back on the job, and our country isn’t making the investments we need
Murray: We have bipartisan momentum right now and we should build on that
Murray: The agreement moved us away from the dysfunction that has defined Congress the past few years &amp; showed bipartisan work is possible
Murray: The bipartisan budget deal was a step in the right direction, but it was only a step.
Murray: Now is the time to move away from governing by crisis &amp; move forward by investing in priorities that help families and communities
Murray: I am hopeful that we in this committee and all of us in Congress can build on the foundation of the bipartisan budget deal
Murray: We were sent here by our constituents to solve problems, not create them. To work together, not to tear each other apart
Murray: There is no question that Congress has spent too much time lurching from crisis to crisis. It’s had a real impact on the economy

Murray: Let’s rebuild trust, find a path to compromise, and work together to strengthen our economy and create jobs. #budgetconference
Murray: Let’s show the American people that their stories are more important than sticking to party line or staying in ideological corners.
Murray: Republicans need to work w/ us to close wasteful tax loopholes &amp; special interest subsidies, to reach a balanced &amp; bipartisan deal.
Murray: I can’t negotiate by myself. Compromise needs to run both ways.
Murray: I’m willing to compromise. I’m ready to listen to Republicans’ ideas, as long as they are fair to seniors and families.
Murray: I’m glad that more and more of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle are stepping up to find a solution to #sequestration.

LIVE: #Budgetconference committee meeting http://t.co/aZloGMojkI
Murray: If there is one lesson from the past few weeks, it’s that the way to avoid gridlock &amp; crisis is through compromise &amp; bipartisanship
Murray: I know it won’t be easy, compromise requires each side to make some changes, but we owe it to the American people to work together
Murray: But, compromise works both ways. Republicans have to work with us to scour the bloated tax code &amp; close wasteful tax loopholes
Murray: I am ready to listen to GOP ideas, &amp; ready to make tough concessions to get a deal, as long as they are fair to seniors &amp; families
Murray: Democrats and Republicans have said replacing #sequestration should be a priority for this #budgetconference
Murray: The very least this conference can do is find a way to replace #sequestration and set a budget level for the short term
Murray: Families across the country find ways to compromise every day, it isn’t always easy, but it’s the only way to make progress
Murray: I want to spend our time here focused not on our differences, but on how can work together to find compromise
Murray: We won’t be able to solve every challenge in these few short weeks, but I am hopeful we can show some bipartisanship is possible

Murray: We want to pass a continuing resolution to keep the government running, and then get to work on a long term budget deal
Murray: The bottom line is we should be thinking about how to create jobs &amp; encourage growth, not be pushed from one crisis to the next
Murray: Now we are days away from a #governmentshutdown, all because #TeaParty Republicans are trying once again to defund #Obamacare
Murray: A bipartisan budget conference would've given us the opportunity to work together, but #teaparty Republicans blocked it 18 times

Murray: There are a number of reforms included #obamacare that put us on track for greater quality with lower costs.
Murray: Current system focuses too much on healing sick people instead of prevention/wellness. This is bad for patients &amp; the economy.

RECAP: Chairman Murray held a hearing today on the impact of the #sequester on the #economy &amp; national security. http://t.co/oYKrFpX8ZP
Murray: If sequestration is not replaced, effects on economy &amp; natl security over the long term will only get worse. http://t.co/HfRT1N6G0E
Murray: There is bipartisan agreement that sequestration is the wrong way to cut spending and bipartisan agreement that it needs to be fixed
Murray: We can’t afford to keep these cuts for another ten years, and we can’t keep governing by crisis
Murray: We need to work together to keep America strong and secure, and keep promises made to our #veterans
Murray: I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are ready to come together and replace these cuts with smarter choices.
Murray: If #sequestration isn’t replaced, the effects on our #economy and our national security over the long-term will only get worse.
Murray: #GOP members of this Committee joined Democrats in agreeing that #sequestration must be reexamined.
Murray: Democrats &amp; Republicans have traveled the country talking about #sequestration. GOP has said cuts would ‘hollow out the military’
Murray: Our world remains a complex and dangerous place, this is not the time to let irresponsible defense cuts impact our security
Murray: We need to invest in job creation, not causing furloughs that hurt service members, families, small businesses, and the economy
Murray: While responsible cuts can be made to #defense programs, cuts from #sequestration are not the answer
Murray: We have a sacred obligation to keep the promises we’ve made to our service members. Cuts from #sequestration threaten this.

Chairman Murray's full opening statement: http://t.co/q5BH5QDFwB #budget
Murray: As #Democrats &amp; #Republicans both know, responsible #deficit reduction is essential to our long-term prosperity. #budget
Murray: Finding savings from unfair tax provisions is an opportunity to responsibly reduce our deficit &amp; invest in our future. #budget
Murray: If we agree that there is wasteful spending in the tax code, the next question is -- how should those savings be used? #budget
Murray: Experts across political spectrum have also proposed eliminating wasteful spending in our tax code as way to reduce our deficit.
Murray: @SpeakerBoehner recently proposed to raise $800B in new #revenue by closing “special-interest loopholes and deductions.” #budget
Masquerading as tax cuts, many of these programs no different from any other federal program that spends taxpayer money. -Sen. @TomCoburn
Murray: We’ve got some clear opportunities to cut wasteful spending and make our tax system work better for middle class families. #budget
Murray: No good reason taxpayers subsidize millionaires more when they purchase a 2nd home, than they do middle class purchasing 1st home.
Murray: When we talk about big gov't #welfare, maybe we shouldn’t always jump to cut spending on those who are most in need. #budget
Murray: Tax expenditures have grown over the last 20 years to become one of the largest impacts on our #deficits &amp; #debt. #budget
Murray: But a big source of spending, and one that deserves to be just as closely examined, is expenditures in our #taxcode. #Budget
Murray: No question that we do need to look at government programs carefully. #Budget
Murray: My #GOP colleagues tend to focus on cutting programs the most vulnerable families depend on get to back on their feet. #budget
Murray: As we’ve looked for ways to reduce our #deficits &amp; #debt, we’ve heard a lot of outrage about waste &amp; excess in government programs.

Murray: I remain hopeful we can find balanced &amp; bipartisan replacement to #sequestration in the next few days. #budget
Murray: Can’t expect #economy to grow in a way that creates prosperity if we continue allowing our #skills &amp; #education deficit to increase.
Murray: If workers don’t have skills they need to fill the #jobs of today &amp; tomorrow, our #economy &amp; businesses pay the price too. #budget
Murray: When we slash investments in schools, Pell Grants, worker training programs, we increase our skills and education deficit. #budget
Murray: Investing in #infrastructure creates #jobs today, makes families safer &amp; lays down a strong foundation for long-term growth. #budget
Murray: If we slash investments in #infrastructure like roads &amp; bridges, we aren’t really saving money at all.  We are making things worse.
