I was going to say the country is run by corporations or the government is cowardly and ineffective but we’ve all heard that before - these events will hasten the amazon google wars and will carve our #tribes up for the @DisneyPixar predicted #BuynLarge https://t.co/PVltfZeUfG
.@ezraklein as @LLBean joins the rest of #gun selling #America in raising their corporate policy to make 21 the de facto gun buying age - it shows 2 things 1) the country is run by PR firms &amp; 2) #Millennials threat of boycott is so unknown it still scares PR firms https://t.co/PUpJXd7b32
America is failing our young. As a father this scares me because this is seen as the lesser of two evils. It is all the same evil. We need to help all kids including the possible bully that might have been bullying him. Where do we start? Start with the guns #AssaultWeaponsBan https://t.co/02IRMdrl2v

Here are my 2 planks - 1) gun buybacks (needs funding and destroying guns in conjunction with law enforcement) 2) self registration for gun owners that want to keep their guns but want to do something (majority of gun owners want sensible gun laws) does this org already exist? https://t.co/eqYC8rKIeE
