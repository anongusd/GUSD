Read the bill. Earning time credits does not grant an inmate release. Inmates must still undergo risk assessment and be deemed low-risk offenders. https://t.co/m8eWCyZnXa
If @SenTomCotton has good faith problems with this bill then he should welcome a full and open debate on the Senate floor where he can offer amendments to provisions he finds objectionable. But first this bill needs to be brought to the Senate floor so debate can begin. /END
Nothing in the First Step Act gives inmates early release. It only incentivizes participation in recidivism reduction programs. At all times the Bureau of Prisons retains all authority over who does and does not qualify for early release. 5/
What the First Step Act does do is encourage rehabilitation by incentivizing inmates to participate in recidivism reduction programs by giving them time credits that can help them qualify for prerelease custody. 4/
Second, and more importantly, the First Step Act does not “give early release” to anyone. Anyone claiming it does, does not understand how the bill works. 3/
First, the House Judiciary committee passed the First Step Act out of committee on May 9 of this year, and the Senate Judiciary Committee passed the highly similar Sentencing and Corrections Act out of committee on Feb 15 of this year. These are not new policies. 2/

Here’s a quick update on today’s #SCOTUS hearing so far: https://t.co/8rEnaUFsyr
There’s a better way for the #Senate to approach its work. This process should be about a jurist’s qualifications, character, and approach to judging. It should not be about results in a select number of cases.
This undermines the legitimacy of the courts. Over time, no free people would accept a judiciary that simply imposes its own preferences on the country, absent fidelity to legal principle.
Every current member of the Supreme Court has adhered to a similar principle.
Sure enough, last term in Ortiz v. United States, #SCOTUS considered a case implicating the scope of Marbury. Likewise, Justice Ginsburg created the so-called “Ginsburg standard”—no previews, forecasts, or hints.
Nominees, for the most part, have resisted trading confirmation in exchange for promises on how they’ll vote. To give two famous examples: Justice Scalia refused to say whether Marbury v. Madison was settled law, on the ground that it could come before him.
This history shows that, over the better part of a century, the Judiciary Committee has gradually created a norm in which members demand that nominees talk about specific cases in return for favorable treatment.
Without getting into the gory details, suffice to say that Senator Ted Kennedy and Judge Bork did not agree on constitutional law. Kennedy’s response was to savage – unfairly – the results he thought Bork would reach.
Twenty-eight years later, the Senate considered Robert Bork’s nomination. This was another turning point, and in my view, remains a rock-bottom moment for the Senate.
Justice Stewart’s 1959 nomination was another turning point. Senators seeking to resist Brown v. Board of Education wanted to grill Stewart about his views on integration. Others wanted to grill Stewart about his views on national security.
But Senators also worried that Frankfurter was a radical based on his defense of anarchists in court. So again, Senators wanted assurances Frankfurter would reach certain results. Frankfurter, however, declined to engage w/Senators &amp; insisted his public record spoke for itself
The next important moment was in 1939, when Justice Frankfurter became the first #SCOTUS nominee to testify before the Senate. At the time, Frankfurter was controversial in part because he was he was born overseas.
They didn’t ask Brandeis to testify, but asked outside witnesses to talk about his nomination.
But Senators also wanted to determine whether Brandeis would use a seat on #SCOTUS to advocate for progressive causes he championed as a public-interest attorney. They wanted to know how he would vote in particular cases.
The first #SCOTUS confirmation hearing occurred in 1916, when Justice Brandeis was nominated. Brandeis was controversial for several reasons—including, it has to be said, because he was Jewish.
When you look at the history, that is precisely why confirmation hearings developed—so that Senators could ask nominees how they would vote in particular cases.
Some of these unfair questions will ask him to promise to vote a certain way in particular cases likely to come before the Court.
Over the next few days, senators will ask Judge #Kavanaugh questions about #SCOTUS cases, his record, and his qualifications. Some of these questions will be fair. Many others will be unfair.
What is the real context of today’s #SCOTUS hearing? Here are some facts:

The Committee is acting in a manner that is principled and consistent with Senate precedent. All members of the Senate have the ability to fully and fairly review the materials relevant to Kavanaugh’s judicial history.
None of these papers will shine light on his legal approach. Being the inbox and outbox for a President doesn’t include giving legal advice; that’s the role for White House counsel, not the Staff Secretary.
Democrats have made it clear that their goal is to bury the Committee in paper, just to delay a vote. Their minds were made up before Kavanaugh was even nominated. They don’t want to see the papers, they want to see his nomination stalled. https://t.co/l8t4BWw9e9

Let’s insist on a reassertion of the American people’s control over their government and of their land. #utpol #SIPublicLands
When ordinary Americans control their communities and land, it is good for both. When the federal government wields exclusive control, it is good for neither. #utpol #SIPublicLands
We have the opportunity to honor the promise the federal government made to Utah and Western states when they joined the Union. #utpol #SIPublicLands
Small reforms here and there are important. But we have to start pushing for what we actually want. We must fight to return these lands. #utpol #SIPublicLands
Finally, our long-term goal must be the transfer of federal lands to the states. And that is the aim of the third bill that I intend to introduce. #utpol #SIPublicLands
This “new” Homestead Act would allow states, local governments, and individuals to petition the government to use federal land for affordable housing… or education… or health care. #utpol #SIPublicLands
The second bill I plan to introduce is a new Homestead Act – one to help ordinary Americans in the 21st century. #utpol #SIPublicLands
Specifically, my bill would prohibit the president from designating or expanding a national monument in the state unless both Congress and the state legislature pass resolutions approving the designation. #utpol #SIPublicLands
The first, the Protecting Utah’s Rural Communities Act, would protect Utah from future Antiquities Act abuses by giving Utah the same protections currently enjoyed by Wyoming and Alaska. #utpol #SIPublicLands
Our immediate task is to rein in that government and reclaim a space for ordinary Americans to live in freedom. I am working on three specific bills to do just that. #utpol #SIPublicLands
Rural Americans want what all Americans want: a dignified, decent-paying job. A family to love and support. A healthy community whose future is determined by local residents—not by their self-styled betters thousands of miles away. #utpol #SIPublicLands
Locals aren’t as lucky. While tourism has contributed much to the West, communities can’t survive on it alone. It is a complement to – not a substitute – for broader economic development. #utpol #SIPublicLands
They delight in seeing vast swathes of untouched lands, fulfilling their idyllic notions of the West where they can jet in, spend a few days at the cabin, take pictures of animals, and then retreat to their enclaves on the coasts. #utpol #SIPublicLands
Things have only gotten worse since. An even more extreme environmental movement, an alliance of privilege between celebrities, activists, and corporate elites now want to save the Earth at the expense of our rural communities. #utpol #SIPublicLands
No longer would it be the official policy of the United States government to sell back the land and entrust it to the people. Instead, the policy would be to keep the land for itself.  #utpol #SIPublicLands
And in 1976, Congress formalized federal control over federal lands by passing the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. This repealed the Homestead Acts and completely upended federal government’s public land policy. #utpol #SIPublicLands
The amount of grazing on federal land went into steep decline, causing an exodus from the range that was never reversed. #utpol #SIPublicLands
Between the mid-1960s and 1980, the amount of wilderness rose from 11.5 million acres to 82.7 million acres—an increase of 716% in less than two decades. #utpol #SIPublicLands
The activists used land-use restrictions as an “all-purpose tool for stopping economic activity,” in the words of political scientist R. McGreggor Cawley. #utpol #SIPublicLands
But in the 60s and 70s environmental activists began exploiting public fears about overpopulation and pollution. #utpol #SIPublicLands
The first westerners were optimistic about federal control of western lands. Teddy Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot advocated for active management of the land, in cooperation with local interests. #utpol #SIPublicLands
Fifty, sixty, even seventy percent of the land within Western states’ boundaries was – and remains – controlled by Washington. #utpol #SIPublicLands
While they were ultimately successful in petitioning Congress to transfer their public lands from federal to state management, Western states have not been so lucky. #utpol #SIPublicLands
Take Illinois and Missouri, for example. At one point, the federal government controlled more than 90% of their land. #utpol #SIPublicLands
The promise to sell federal lands in Utah is right there, enshrined in federal law. But, unlike states farther East, the commitment to us was never honored. #utpol #SIPublicLands
When Utah came into the Union in 1896, Section 9 of its statehood enabling legislation declared that public land located within the state “shall be sold by the United States subsequent to the admission of said state into the union.” #utpol #SIPublicLands
While Easterners and Midwesterners had almost-total control of the land within their boundaries, Western states like Utah entered the Union on inferior terms – as tenants to negligent landlords. #utpol #SIPublicLands
But by the time Utah and other states entered the Union, Congress had turned its attention elsewhere. Manifest destiny left us behind. #utpol #SIPublicLands
The Homestead Acts were an engine for middle-class opportunity and growth and set the American standard for the disposition of public resources. #utpol #SIPublicLands
The cornerstone of this policy was the Homestead Acts which transferred 270 million acres of land out of federal control and into the hands of ordinary Americans. #utpol #SIPublicLands
Throughout the 19th century, Lawmakers sought to facilitate expansion of the nation by acquiring land—and then transferring it to the people, so they could live out their lives as responsible citizens of the republic. #utpol #SIPublicLands
How did it come to pass that nearly half of the land in the West is owned by the federal government, compared to just 5 percent of the land in the East? #utpol #SIPublicLands

The DPGA corrects the mistake Congress made in 2012 and protects Americans from indefinite government detention. https://t.co/RXgpkFeKUK.…
What kind of country would we have if we freely allowed our government to detain us indefinitely without charge, trial, or counsel?
Please tell your senators to support the Due Process Guarantee Act as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act.  Let’s vote!
@sebastian_byron @conncarroll I’m just trying to fix a problem in the law—one that is easy to ignore today, but could give rise to significant problems.
@sebastian_byron Making law is my job.  We are one step way from fixing a bad law and making a better one.
By contrast, imagine the immense harm that could come from a law that authorizes the indefinite detention of American citizens!
Where is the harm in a law saying that Americans can’t be indefinitely detained without charge or trial on US soil?
Our govt isn’t now indefinitely detaining US citizens without charge or trial. But why leave a law in place that purports to authorize that?
Why would anyone who voted for a nearly identical version of the DPGA in 2012 now deny his colleagues the right to cast this vote?
Why block such a vote, especially when 68 senators wanted to take that vote?
Why would a senator object to letting the Senate even VOTE on whether to protect Americans’ due process rights?
Why would anyone choose to vote against a bill restoring existing constitutional protections that have been undermined by a bad law?
Had we voted on the DPGA, it would have passed, protecting the due process rights of hundreds of millions of American citizens.
The DPGA should have received a vote in the Senate.  A total of 68 senators voted against a motion to table the DPGA; they wanted a vote!
The DPGA, which I authored along with @SenFeinstein, was pending as an amendment to this year’s National Defense Authorization Act.
American citizens arrested on American soil should never be subject to indefinite detention without charge, trial, jury, or counsel.
@UnsolicitedOpin Sadly, members of both political parties passed and later protected section 1021 of the 2012 NDAA, which made DPGA necessary.
@robert_dunaway Yes it does.  Section 1021 of the 2012 NDAA purports to undermine that and other protections.  We can’t ignore that.
The American people cannot be asked to wait another moment before their due process rights are protected by the Due Process Guarantee Act.
Each year, @SenFeinstein and I have been told we’d get a vote on the DPGA “at some point,” but it has not happened.  The time has come!
Ever since 2012, @SenFeinstein and I have been trying to put the DPGA back into each year’s National Defense Authorization Act.
@SenFeinstein and I introduced the DPGA in 2012. It passed with 67 votes, but was somehow removed from the NDAA before final passage.
The DPGA was made necessary by Sec. 1021 of the 2012 NDAA, which purported to give the government unrestrained power to detain Americans.
The Due Process Guarantee Act would protect U.S. citizens on U.S. soil from being detained indefinitely without charge, counsel, or trial.
American citizens arrested on American soil should never be subject to indefinite detention without charge, trial, jury, or counsel.

In the next hour, the Senate will be voting on the Due Process Guarantee Act. I hope my fellow Senators will acknowledge the mistake Congress made in 2012 and vote not to table the amendment.
Congress can take a stand for the Constitution by allowing a vote on the Due Process Guarantee Act, which corrects the mistake Congress made in 2012 and protects Americans from indefinite government detention. https://t.co/mQ7LQf3gMH

The use of chemical weapons absolutely requires a response from the United States. But if that response is going to include military force, the President of the United States should come to Congress and ask for authorization before military force is used.

2,232 pages. $1.3 trillion. 48 hours.
The power to declare war belongs to Congress. By tabling this measure today, we have chosen yet again to abdicate our constitutional responsibility.
If we choose in this moment to table this resolution we are making a choice to be willfully blind to the exercise of a power that belongs to us. https://t.co/oo3zZbJg9i
This is a fast track process, this is really why the war power resolution matters here. It helps the Senate exercise it’s Article I Section 8 war power. 6/6
The war powers resolution provides us with the internal procedural mechanism for putting this up for a vote. This is a privileged motion, meaning we can get it brought to the floor and doesn’t require what we call cloture. 5/6
That doesn’t mean it (the War Power Resolution) is unconstitutional. It’s not. This is exactly what the Constitution contemplates. 4/6
Now, that’s not surprising because the whole purpose of the War Powers Resolution was to allow Congress to exercise its power to declare war, so presidents are naturally going to resist efforts to restrict and restrain their power. 3/6
The WSJ claims that the War Powers Resolution is somehow unconstitutional, citing no authority other than themselves and saying that presidents since then have regarded it as wrong or unconstitutional. 2/6

@SenBennetCO How do you think Outdoor Retailers are going to react when they get to CO and find this? (11/11) https://t.co/gtVuMi9Xao
@SenBennetCO “Give us what we want or we will hurt you” isn’t going to play any better in CO than it did in UT. (10/11)
@SenBennetCO If Outdoor Retailers move to CO, it won’t take long for them to learn that CO isn’t going to give them everything they want either. (9/11)
@SenBennetCO Utah Elected officials don’t take Outdoor Retailers seriously anymore. Our superb outdoor recreation amenities aren’t going anywhere. (8/11)

@SenBennetCO As soon as Outdoor Retailers stop seeing those who oppose their agenda as caricatures, they'll probably become better at advocacy. (5/11)
@SenBennetCO The Outdoor Retailers operate from the false assumption that $$$ is the only thing that informs opposition to Bears Ears. (4/11)
@SenBennetCO As a friend/colleague, I give you benefit of the doubt that when you take a policy position, it's rooted in dearly held principle. (3/11)

This vacancy was a central to 2016 campaign &amp; the people have spoken by electing President Trump and returning a Republican Senate majority.
Judge Gorsuch is a judge’s judge, who is well within the mainstream and always decides cases based on what the law says.
Judge Gorsuch's opinions are well-reasoned &amp; brilliantly written. He has enriched the Tenth Circuit’s jurisprudence in a number of areas.
Judge Gorsuch is a prepared, thoughtful, and careful jurist, who has demonstrated a strong commitment to textualism and originalism.
I’ve had the privilege of arguing before Judge Gorsuch and he is extremely impressive.

Senate doesn't need to eliminate filibuster. Better solution is to work more than 3 days per week. Allow time for debate and deliberation.
The real problem in the Senate isn't the filibuster. What we really need is for Senate to be the Senate: an open, deliberative body.
What a healthy Senate lacks in efficiency, it makes up for with open, robust deliberation.
The filibuster is about leverage, and that leverage is essential to maintaining equality and engendering deliberation among Senators.
Everything in the Senate is rooted in occupational equality of all Senators - filibuster protects this.
The Senate is broken, but the filibuster has almost nothing to do with it.

I look forward to joining my colleagues in voting to repeal #Obamacare and entering A new phase of health reform: https://t.co/TMOybmItN4
Train wrecks are accidents, aberrations, anomalies. The failures of #Obamacare were no such thing – they were entirely predictable.
“Train wreck” isn’t quite the right metaphor to describe the calamity that is the Affordable Care Act: https://t.co/TMOybmItN4
To date, half of the 23 co-ops created under #Obamacare have collapsed, despite receiving billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies.
It’s not just patients who find #Obamacare to be too expensive. Insurance providers are coming to same conclusion: https://t.co/TMOybmItN4
#Obamacare's toxic combination of rising costs and limited choices has had serious consequences for low- and middle-income Americans.
In my home state of Utah, the residents of 20 out of the state’s 29 counties are limited to only one insurance plan under #Obamacare. #utpol
The facts prove that quality, affordable health care is harder to find in America today than it was six years ago: https://t.co/TMOybmItN4
No one seriously claims #Obamacare has made it easier or more affordable for American people to access the health care services they need.
By #Obamacare's own standards set by the ideologues who imposed it on an unwilling country, it has been a failure: https://t.co/TMOybmItN4
Because of pledge to repeal #Obamacare the American people put the GOP in charge of the House and Senate. https://t.co/TMOybmItN4

GOP should be the party of reform. But we won’t be, so long as individual senators are blocked from offering amendments to legislation.
GOP should be party of ideas. But we won’t be, if we continue tolerating a legislative process that stifles our most innovative proposals.

A new generation of conservative ideas must come from a new generation of conservative leaders, &amp; for the 1st time in a long time, they are.
America’s real problem of inequality is the opportunity gap between Washington, D.C &amp; everybody else. #CPAC2014 http://t.co/Ymsmfy4nns
And we see opportunity deficit at the top, where political &amp; corporate elites rig system to benefit themselves at expense of everyone else.

Washington creates middle class opportunity deficit by driving up costs of gas, groceries, homes, health care, raising kids, &amp; education.
We see this opportunity deficit at the bottom of our economy, where dysfunctional welfare policies trap poor families in poverty. #CPAC2014
An agenda for our time must meet the challenge of our time – &amp; of your generation. That challenge is America’s growing opportunity deficit.
It’s time for the Republican Party to stop talking about Ronald Reagan and start acting like him. http://t.co/FkSgbTFyhu #CPAC2014
In 1976 conservatives found a leader for the ages - yet they still lost. By 1980, they had developed an agenda for their time - &amp; they won.
Ronald Reagan came to CPAC &amp; called for a New Republican Party, a party of principles &amp; confidence &amp; a positive agenda for change. #CPAC2014
The last time conservatives faced this challenge was thirty-seven years ago at the fourth annual CPAC Conference in February 1977. #CPAC2014
And whether the people at this podium are willing to do that work depends on whether the people in this audience demand it. #CPAC2014

@eltiare Then, ideally, the bill would pass with a large bipartisan vote.
@eltiare Through this process Congress could identify less important programs and reform them to pay for other veterans’ priorities.
@eltiare Then the bill should be brought to the floor where senators who do not sit on the Veterans Affairs Committee could amend the bill.
@eltiare This should start with the Veterans Affairs Committee marking up a bill as a committee.

Government-driven inequality is the reason why six of the ten wealthiest counties in America are now suburbs of Washington, D.C.
#Obamacare is an inequality Godzilla that has robbed working families of their insurance, their doctors, their wages and their jobs.
Inequality is changing laws without congressional approval, &amp; spying on Americans without constitutional authority. http://t.co/86tmlHtLdj
Inequality is the federal government hurting rural communities, especially in the West, by controlling and mismanaging public lands.
Inequality is denying citizens the right to define marriage in their states as traditionally or as broadly as their diverse values dictate.
Inequality is blocking thousands of middle-class energy jobs as a favor to partisan donors &amp; radical environmental activists.
#Inequality is guaranteeing insurance companies taxpayer bailouts if #Obamacare cuts into their profits. http://t.co/86tmlHtLdj
Inequality is penalizing low-income parents for getting married, or getting better jobs: http://t.co/86tmlHtLdj
Inequality – real inequality - is trapping poor children in failing schools to benefit bureaucrats and union bosses: http://t.co/86tmlHtLdj
"I’d like to speak especially to those Americans who may feel they have been forgotten by both political parties." http://t.co/y2y0VKzlhN
Government creates inequality when it takes rights &amp; opportunities away from American people &amp; gives them to politicians &amp; bureaucrats.
Tonight, the President’s lofty rhetoric on inequality ignores the fact that his administration has left poor &amp; middle-class families behind.
Inequality crisis = poor trapped in poverty, middle-class insecurity, and cronyist privilege at the top. http://t.co/rtwXMvGJIH
We face an inequality crisis — one to which the President has paid lip-service, but seems uninterested in truly confronting or correcting.
Today, Americans know in their hearts that something is wrong as the “American Dream” is falling out of reach for far too many of us.
The founders made a point at Boston Harbor, but they made history in Philadelphia’s Independence Hall.
In America, the test of any political movement is not what that movement is against, but what it is for.
It took founders 14 long years to get from Boston to Philadelphia, where they created, with our Constitution, the government they did want.
@itsmesteph11 Here's the text: http://t.co/qvmYD0HCfK
@ShannonJoyRadio Here's the text.  We'll post video soon: http://t.co/qvmYD0HCfK
The Boston Tea Party patriots moved past a protest against the government they didn’t want and marched toward the government they did want.
In 1773, Americans had simply had it with a London-based national government that had become too big, too expensive and far too intrusive.
Protesting against dysfunctional government is a great American tradition, going back to the original Tea Party in Boston.

We must remind the American people of the harmful effects of #Obamacare at every opportunity if we are ever going to see it repealed.
In Washington, victories are rarely immediate &amp; very few are permanent. #Obamacare wasn’t enacted overnight &amp; it won’t be repealed overnight
When the avoidance of political risk becomes our dominant motivation, only the Washington establishment wins.  And the American people lose.
Avoiding difficult battles is how we ended up in this mess: $17 trillion in debt, a broken entitlement system, a tax code no one understands

My floor speech from earlier today to oppose #Go8 bill: http://t.co/oG2jawVcpp Click on link and help me RT if you share my concerns.
I support immigration reform. But #Go8 is not immigration reform. It is big government dysfunction. I am voting no: http://t.co/0Rx1s0lT78
There's simply no legitimate reason why we have to pass a one-size-fits-all 1,200-page, take-it-or-leave-it #immigration bill.
the only reason #immigration reform is so controversial is because the Senate refuses to pass it one piece at a time.
The House appears to have learned from #Go8 dysfunction and wants no part of this.  They are passing step-by-step reforms.
The special interests had a huge hand in writing the #Go8 bill while the American people had no role: http://t.co/1XCVo3oPh5
The so-called comprehensive approach has been utterly discredited. #Go8 bill reaffirms why vast majority of Americans distrust Washington.
The #Go8 process has revealed all the problems inherent in passing massive pieces of legislation that try to fix all of problems at once.
For grand finale, the #Go8 proponents substituted what is effectively a brand-new bill instead of the one we've been debating for 2 months.
For a 1,200-page bill we were allowed exactly nine roll call votes to amend #Go8 before the process was shut down.
They said there would be regular order for #Go8 on the floor of the senate, but that turned out to be a false promise as well.
During committee markup Democrats &amp; #Go8 Republicans voted as a block to defeat virtually all substantive amendments to improve the bill.
We were told that if we didn't like what was in #Go8 that we'd have an opportunity to fix it. But that wasn't true either.
From day one, the country was misled about what was in #Go8 bill. The talking points never matched bill's reality: http://t.co/8uM7N7bSFY
As a matter of process, senators should be embarrassed about how #Go8 bill has moved through the senate. http://t.co/ADQzNcmdHx
According to CBO, #Go8 will reduce illegal immigration by just a mere 25% over the next ten years: reason alone to scrap entire bill.
The #Go8 bill transfers too much authority &amp; discretion to the executive branch, exacerbating an already widespread problem in federal gov.
The #Go8 bill remains grossly unfair to those who have languished in our current legal immigration system for decades.
The #Go8 bill cuts the American people out by cutting out congressional oversight of pathway to citizenship process: http://t.co/crWlm7SzM7
#Go8 bill is full of promises to beef up border security, but it makes no assurances. http://t.co/LRAJAOWJP5
As a matter of public policy, #Go8 fails to meet many of the goals that we set to meet at the beginning of the process.

We don’t need another 1,000 page bill full of unintended consequences. We need real #immigration reform. http://t.co/5Mp6TyLsBp #tcot
The only reason #immigration reform is controversial is because the Senate refuses to take it step by step.  http://t.co/px18RB7r1S &lt;See pic
I have sponsored, cosponsored or could support over half of the 40 #immigration bills introduced in 113th Congress.
There are more than 40 individual pieces of immigration-related legislation that have been introduced in this congress alone.
I support legal #immigration into our country and recognize that immigration is vital to nation's success.
Far from “good,” S7.44 repeats the mistakes of the past, makes our #immigration system worse, and will lead to bigger problems.
There are reports that Democrats have asked CBO to evaluate S.744, but report won’t be published until next week. #betterlatethannever
Proponents of this #immigration bill have so far refused to do their own cost analysis. Taxpayers should know how much it will cost.
WATCH @ChuckGrassley explain how claims that there will be stiff penalties for those who broke law are false. http://t.co/68NYyB7FTH
S.744 is inherently unfair to the many who have tried to navigate our current broken immigration system. #CIRfloor
I can certainly see why Congress would want to evade responsibility for consequences of S.744, but our republic shouldn't function this way.
S.744 authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security in hundreds of instances, to simply ignore #immigration law. #CIRfloor
S.744 surrenders control of #immigration law to the Secretary of Homeland Security and other unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats. #CIRfloor
S.744 leaves Congress and the American people out of the loop. #CIRfloor
As branch of gov. most accountable to people, Congress must play a vital role in approving, overseeing, and verifying #immigration reforms.
S.744 offers no congressional oversight of how the executive branch implements these immigration reforms. #CIRfloor
If all we do is fix border-security portion, #immigration bill is still considerably weak in major areas, and is still unworthy of support.
Failing to secure the border is the quickest way to repeat the mistakes of the past. #CIRFloor
S.744 offers more of same from Washington: plans, promises, commissions, studies and spending, but no action on border security. #CIRfloor
