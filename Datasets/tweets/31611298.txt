@gelliottmorris And to be clear for the anti-fans: I’m not defending Mr Schultz, who appears to be running out of self regard without discernible political ideas. I am defending a better and more careful political dialog.
@gelliottmorris Ah, now we have the modifier “implies” rather than equivalence. But is it not possible that Mr. Schultz means what he says, that it is unamerican to say something “can’t succeed”? That’s kind of true. But instead he’s a fascist?
@pwnedlib @gelliottmorris Part of the reason we’ve been quiet is that the committee hasn’t technically existed for a month.
@pwnedlib @gelliottmorris So instead of sitting on a train having a beer perusing Twitter, I should be “doing investigative work”. Perhaps down the way in the Quiet Car?
@pwnedlib @gelliottmorris Fair enough. As far as I can tell, he has no discernible reason for running other than self-regard and frustration.
@pwnedlib @gelliottmorris Also a logical fallacy. The thing about defending the truth is that it’s most important to do when it is unpopular to do so. Comfort with convenient untruths is the fuel for con men and sophists.
@gelliottmorris Dude. I carry no H2O for Mr. Schultz. But you’re a journalist. For The Economist no less. UnAmerican is not the equivalent of fascist.

In fact, it's BECAUSE these decisions are so hard that your representatives in Congress should bear the responsibility.  Whether it's Yemen, Iraq, Afghanistan, or the risk of future wars in places like Iran, you deserve a Congress that will speak up and do its job. 3/3
Instead of abrogating our duty, Congress should be reclaiming our power as laid out in the Constitution. Deciding whether to use military force in your name is the most serious decision a Representative can make, and we can't cede that to the President just because it's hard 2/3
In a procedural vote today, the House may limit Congress's power to curtail US involvement in the brutal Saudi war in Yemen. It represents a further stripping of Congress's Constitutional war powers, and the Republican commitment to a horrible war. 1/3

@WAlisberg Majority: more than 50%. 	American: citizen of the USA	Voters: subset of Americans who vote. 		🍎 🍎s?
@WAlisberg When the rep tie wearing Young Republican troll on twitter doesn’t understand the complexity and logical challenges of the construction “majority of American voters”.
@OatsBee @realDonaldTrump Yes. In the Land of Total Non Sequiturs.
@dcfodder @realDonaldTrump Non sequitur.
@DMisc06473 @realDonaldTrump But thanks for playing.
@DMisc06473 @realDonaldTrump So you don’t have to wait. This is not a court of law, and courtroom rules do not apply. It is the constitutional exercise of senatorial advice and consent. And Ford’s charges merit the investigation Flake forced as do questions about Cavanaugh’s temperament.
@YourServiceYW @realDonaldTrump Fake ? So you’ve seen the FBI report? Odd that they would give it to you before they shared it with the Congress.
@mi2guys @realDonaldTrump You’re right. Except for the ideas of Social Security, Medicare, responsible deficit reduction, universal healthcare coverage, not getting into dumb wars, justice, equality before the law and conservation. Other than those, you’re right.
@Blakester422 @realDonaldTrump Hahahaha.
@2yaks @realDonaldTrump Pretty damn good. Remember it in January 2009, before the Obama administration?
@politikx @realDonaldTrump @HarryForCT Oh. So she should be mocked. Wake up.
@jetraok @realDonaldTrump Actually, challenging the President is my job, constitutionally speaking. And equating exaggerating service in/during Vietnam with heartlessly mocking a vulnerable victim is really something.
@scott_sylvia @realDonaldTrump Asking a question, not lecturing. And yes, Dems have a lot to answer for after providing healthcare to millions, reviving the American economy, reducing student loan rates, stabilizing the financial system, protecting Social Security. Going straight to hell, I imagine.
@CPLiebau @realDonaldTrump That’s not the same question. But no, I don’t think any of them have brutally and thoughtlessly taunted a vulnerable victim.
@WAlisberg @realDonaldTrump It wasn’t a lecture, it was a question. And a majority of American voters supported HRC. You’re saying that none of them can speak of ethics again? And those who endorsed DJT can?

"If Sessions won't un-recuse and Mueller won't clear the President, we're the only ones, which is really the danger ... we have to keep all these seats.”		Chairman Nunes of Republican control of Congress and Intelligence.		Didn’t expect him to confirm it publicly.

@darngoodload So tell me where the lines are.

If migrants are here illegally, that needs to be addressed. Our border must be secure. We are a nation of laws. But dehumanizing rhetoric about “infestation” and MS-13 and all migrants being criminals is wrong. Morally wrong. By any standard.
Some things are hard about immigration. Some things are not. Seeing migrants as people is not. Despite what @realDonaldTrump says, most risk their lives to work in our restaurants, homes, buildings and fields like this one in Rio Hondo. It’s almost 100 outside. https://t.co/GBrURvFvaS

So now in addition to a better DACA deal, a better NAFTA deal, and a better North Korea deal, I'll be waiting for the promised better Iran deal. I'm not yet tired of winning.
Against the advice of the world and his own security experts, the President has committed a dangerous act of vandalism and continues a dark and cynical moment in American history.
We are now in a world in which North Korea, our enemies and our allies know that an American commitment is worth no more than the paper it is written on. We are not in a world in which the President's fantasy of a better deal is likely.
We are now closer to a world in which centrifuges are spinning again in Iran and people are explaining to me why a military attack is the only way to stop an Iranian weapon of mass destruction.

8) I will not stop working on your behalf until we have achieved these goals. Even when the fight seems uphill, even when we get tired, we know we are in this together. Let’s get to work.
7) We need smarter laws to protect us and keep us safe. We need laws that make it harder to buy and use weapons whose only purpose is to kill as quickly as possible.
6) Those of us who know people who have suffered through horrific shootings like Sandy Hook understand that his approach will cost more lives, both in continued mass shootings and in the deadly, daily gun violence we see across our country.
5) He assured us that he speaks with “Wayne and Chris” and the “incredible” people at the NRA about how to protect children from violence. The solution that drew the most cheers from the audience? Arming teachers with concealed weapons.
4) He argued against smart gun laws like the ones we have in Connecticut. The ones that we know save lives.
3) He continued pushing the lie that only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun (despite the recent, life-saving heroism of James Shaw, Jr., who was unarmed, in a Tennessee Waffle House).
2) After spending his opening congratulating himself on poll numbers, reading from print the Wall Street Journal, and bragging about “decimating Obamacare,” he launched into a full-throated defense of guns.

2/2 The American people are smart enough to see through this lame, limp, hypocritical go-nowhere patheticness. It’s why they don’t trust Congress. This is counterfeit legislative viagra.
1/2 Right now, House Republicans are “passing” a balanced budget amdt to the Constitution. Right after blowing a historical $2 trillion hole in the budget through tax cuts + massive spending. Penance? Closing barn door? Whatever, it’s the most hypocritical thing I’ve seen in DC.

@hotelkeys Yes. And rightly so.
I blame Congress as much as I blame Presidents for this unconstitutional war making tradition. Many members of Congress would rather not be held accountable for the consequences of a war vote. That’s not leadership. It’s laziness and fecklessness. 3/3
Presidents of both parties have repeatedly violated the constitution and the law by going to war without Congressional approval. The law matters. So does the power of going to war only when validated by the representatives of the people. 2/3
This is important: the War Powers Resolution (or “Act” as it has become known) DOES NOT give @realDonaldTrump the authority to strike Syria without Congressional approval absent an attack on us. Here is the key part of the law. 1/3 https://t.co/K0EJU928as

@c_fauquier Yeah, except that I do my own tweeting, not staff or interns. And your answer is rich with irony and hypocrisy. Let’s hear a position from you, not mere mudslinging.
@c_fauquier As I always say, a resort to personal attacks is a near perfect indicator of weakness and lack of confidence.
@theglpkid Actually, this vote split the Democratic Party in both House and Senate. But thanks for playing.
@Touch_of_Gray99 No, I don’t.
@c_fauquier I have. Three times. It’s malarkey.
I will not enable a continuing failure to govern that is as dangerous as it is incompetent, which is why I voted against another short-term bill. Defense, opioids, DREAMers, CHC all need stability and solutions, not stopgaps.

2/ So @realDonaldTrump is either lying, or he declassifed a judicial warrant possibly targeting him. I think we need to know which it is.
1/ The President can't "order" a wiretap. They are ordered by a judge if there is 1) possible crime, or 2) possible foreign agent involved.

@JesseFFerguson @marcthiessen True. But she shouldn't have said even that Republicans were her enemy. Lousy rhetoric.
@marcthiessen Ah, misdirection away from your statement. I'm not outraged. And I thought HRC's statement was absurd. So, no inconsistency.
@marcthiessen whatever else you said, you mischaracterized what BO said. He was talking about voters saying it. And yes, I'm a MC. So what?
@marcthiessen You are a journalist. Get the facts. And read my words closely. Or just stick with Fox.
@marcthiessen Your indirect and arch defense of DJT will not shield you from history's judgment when it comes down.
@marcthiessen 1) he didn't say that, 2) he voiced regret for what he did say, 3) drawing equivalence with DJT is absurd. But keep it up.

@GoodJobGuru @PoliticalLine Yes. The election is over. But the electoral college has not met. So no President has been legally chosen.

Seriously. The falcon cannot hear the falconer. PEOTUS is attacking the CIA &amp; defending the Russians. Attacking media and ignoring the PDB.
