Better chance of not avoiding WD by going to illicit drugs. Kratom needs to be protected for the public to ensure safe clean product. Between CPP and SUD and many in between raw herb kratom is a safer option to ppl w/out med options.
CPP need adequate pain mngt. they are less likely to OD if they have treatment by Dr instead of seeking relief on the black market. Methadone/suboxone for CPP need to have CP on script for accurate CDC data as to count them CP not SUD. Slower taper for opiates they'll have beeter
In this study it points out as many as half ppl w/ SUD will not have access to MAT. Making kratom herb available and supporting it's use as natural form MAT can save lives. More Narcan, especially for minorities and families of SUD, save lives, right? 		https://t.co/FaySYxgax9

@bigtoonah We lost a kind man.
@60Minutes I felt so special when he stopped at the elevator to listen to my story it was 2 yrs ago may he RIP. Not many was as kind as he was. I tweeted him this morning, how strange.
I had the honor of meeting @SenJohnMcCain couple yrs. ago. He was so kind at the elevator and listened to my 2 min. speech about kratom. He was patient and really listened. Shook my hand, was such a gentle kind man. #RIPSenatorMcCain https://t.co/FYl07kDc9q
@nickpwing Well my metabolism has increased. It may be high naturally but was suppressed due to Rx or kratom speed it up. Till more human studies are done it is just speculation

@QueenLaReyna @browndotflop @Williamjturner7 @SGottliebFDA Many were not properly tapered and because the flu like sickness sought out drugs on the black market. CPP abandoned seeking relief end up on heroin or worse, fenyntal. I challenge you, ask addicts if they had a taper before seeking drugs
@browndotflop @Williamjturner7 @SGottliebFDA Our stance on opioids/opiates are if you need it you should have the right to a prescription. We are not "anti-pharma" and have stood with Dr's of courage at the DC rally to stand with other CPP. Please do not mistake advocacy for demonizing from my org.

Widespread opioid addiction has also hampered economic productivity and necessitated additional spending on social services, education, and criminal justice, at a cumulative cost of $1 trillion, he said.
Mark Parrino, president of the AA for the Treatment of OUD, said that between 2001 - 2017, US spent $217 billion on healthcare-related costs connected to the opioid abuse epidemic.

@realDonaldTrump Take a look at your own backyard you have corruption on the FDA and you are allowing Pharma to over ride health of Americans FounderKratomUnited@gmail.com
@SGottliebFDA Check your FaceBook and open the chat I sent you tox reports since you obviously didn't read them before publishing your "health warning" You need to see what side of history your going to be remembered for. Death by drugs or health by choice?
@DrewTurner73 If someone has an accident or surgery you can't be anti-pharma when they offer you propofol are you going to say no? Post op pain? What if your in a banned state? What if your allergic to it? It should be a choice and is why I have refused to join the anti-pharma bandwagon.
@DrewTurner73 Thank you! I have said I am not "anti-pharma" I am pro-choice, my body my choice what I chose to use for my illness. I have stood side by side Dr's of courage standing for the right of the patients on the steps of the DOJ.
@SGottliebFDA If your research on vaccines is as poor as your research on kratom I hate to say I can not believe you. Check your DM on FaceBook I sent tox reports you may have not seen, the one's you sited. And respond to @RepAndyBarr request for a meeting with me and kratom leaders and groups

@interimphys @kevinmd The 13 Rx I was on was highly toxic and dangerous. The side effects from the FDA approved drugs were dangerous but not kratom. 4 yrs experience and 21 yrs sober without a doubt this tea leaf is safe. Now what about methadone?
@interimphys @kevinmd So to answer your question. No it is not toxic or harmful. Only way someone could die from kratom is if a tree feel over and hit you on the head. Mixing illicit drugs with anything potentially kills the person.
@alicerobertsmd @interimphys @kevinmd Thank you I love seeing med pros look at the science before weighing in. I have so much respect for you!

@RWPUSA A complete waste of my time I got a better response from other state congressman than my own how sad is that and I even had research doctors scientists psychiatrist psychologist addiction specialist yet it's my job to educate these agencies?
@RWPUSA The research I'll send you the research but I'm going to support my constituents because they have proven its safe and it's helping kentuckians but that's not what I got when I went to his office three times the fourth time I didn't even go into his office I felt it was a
@RWPUSA So it's my job to go Advocate to the da, DEA, FDA, drug court, pharmacist, you name it it was on the list of agencies I and responsible to educate an advocate for Kratom instead of him reading the research on it and telling these agencies here at the research if you want to see
@RWPUSA I never expected this kind of a response. @RepAndyBarr is my congressman and I'm not pleased with his representation for myself not my family. His office told me that I had to convince these local and state agencies Kratom is beneficial and safe

@headdock @tedwards0701 @JeffreyFudin @EricaWegrzyn @menaraouf92 @CDCgov What would be a scenario to do the cheapest double blind study would it be possible to do it in a somewhat controlled environment like a drug rehab?
@DanSmithJrs @headdock @JeffreyFudin @EricaWegrzyn @menaraouf92 @CDCgov I just finished up six emails to send him every single research letter affidavit that I have ever read in the 3 years and that includes Dr's eight factor analysis
@headdock @tedwards0701 @JeffreyFudin @EricaWegrzyn @menaraouf92 @CDCgov Actually an average of 2 billion, but with six billion authorized by Congress for the opioid epidemic applying for Grants right now if for alternatives to opioids they probably approve it
@headdock @tedwards0701 @JeffreyFudin @EricaWegrzyn @menaraouf92 @CDCgov There are grants and with the work Congress did authorizing 6 billion dollars to go towards the epidemic have you looked at some of the grants available now? Dr. McCurdy has applied for 2 recently
@tedwards0701 @headdock @JeffreyFudin @EricaWegrzyn @menaraouf92 @CDCgov Air statement leaves me with the feeling that you're expecting it to me scheduled you know your expectations can become your reality so if you make your reality through your expectations expect it to stay legal for responsible adults
@tedwards0701 @headdock @JeffreyFudin @EricaWegrzyn @menaraouf92 @CDCgov That is very true I have been raising funds for my work that our consultant and I did in Kentucky West Virginia Tennessee DC four times I just got home from DC Saturday morning all this takes money and we could put it into research instead

@headdock @JeffreyFudin @EricaWegrzyn @menaraouf92 @CDCgov I have plenty of research I would be willing to email you, contact information with some of the leading researchers on Kratom since it's been studied for 13 years
@headdock @JeffreyFudin @EricaWegrzyn @menaraouf92 @CDCgov With all due respect you do have the wrong perception is been used in Asia for hundreds of years without incident the FDA doesn't have the best history with their approved drugs and I'm a prime example of why the FDA needs to be revamped.

“Prescribed to Death” Opioid Memorial
@Surgeon_General Thankyou! I personally feel we have a mental health epidemic in America not a gun problem not a pill problem. Ppl are looking to escape so address the underlying issue and you'll heal the people from the inside out.
@Surgeon_General @FLOTUS Looks like a scene from Men In Black I prefer plants over pill I made the conscious decision to stop opioids and I have to be honest, I never became addicted to them, it's illicit fenyntal, stolen pills they addicts are using. The CDC admitted the stats were wrong.
@Surgeon_General 1, 747 crashes 4 days, not from a plane crash, opioids. But get the facts straight. Illicit fenyntal not Rx fenyntal, not everyone on Rx narcotics becomes addicted. CPP are paying for the mistakes of addicts. Stop RC's from coming in the US and you'll arrest the true culpret.
@Surgeon_General Try giving more rewards for positive behavior and they'll strive to be rewarded time and time again but I have to say, I may be old school but not a fan is using "high" with kids.
@Surgeon_General The study with rats in "rat park" proves socialization enables recovery and gives a high rate of success.
@Surgeon_General You have to give it away to keep it and always be living the program you never know who's watching. You may be the only message a struggling addict/alcoholic see's before they hit bottom.

@SGottliebFDA Respond, silly autocorrect!
@SGottliebFDA FYI, cancer feeds off of sugar. Cut out all sugar and watch patients resound to treatment with a higher success rate. And legalize medical cannabis oil for medical since science and antidotal evidence proves higher success of cancer going into remission

@shelia_ossege @Kpascuch @SGottliebFDA Fibro Warrior sister right here too!
@SGottliebFDA Why not advocate for natural herbs instead of synthetic drugs to fight disease? Skullcap, known to actually help heal central nervous system addressing conditions like fibro, PTSD, diabetic nerve pain, anxiety disorders.

Nice try @ScottGottliebMD @SGottliebFDA @POTUS can't you see? https://t.co/Be5NZsLwkH
@jjiimm_64 @realDonaldTrump they're too busy lobbying to ban natural alternatives because it'll cut into their profits (again!)

@addictPhoneHelp I'm old school, been detoxing addicts and alcoholics at home for 20 years. Pain reminds us what we have to look forward to of we relapse.
@addictPhoneHelp How many made 1 yr?
@addictPhoneHelp Yes it is! Met with a WV senator that held up a large binder. Each child born addicted per page. LARGE BOOK! Sad babies are collateral damage, it's awful to see!
@addictPhoneHelp Everyone can't afford a rehab they need cheaper and affordable options, like kratom.

@Jojordan53 @EvlondoCooper @nickpwing Bingo! Fabricant has some skeletons in his closet too goes to show "charter" I got an anonymous file in the mail almost 2 yrs ago on him
@nickpwing This must be the one the parent messaged me the U-47700 was not the COD but the combo of kratom and U-47700. I thought that odd since U-47700 was lethal on it's own. Greif a parent goes though is something I can't imagine but really takes it another direction FDA allow and adopt

I have to give a personal shout-out to my all-time favorite psychiatrist and Dr! I don't think anybody will know truly the impact you have had on saving kratom	@MarcSwogger https://t.co/8oGKLHYfEe
@DCHankins @Cernovich I don't even use opiates and I'm a chronic pain patient unfortunately I'm going to have to disagree with you I think pain patients cancer patients in the elderly at the end of life should have a safe alternative like Kratom if doctors refuse to treat their pain
@_YvonneBurton @Cernovich Ask @realDonaldTrump he put them in the position after he said he was going to drain the swamp he filled it up with the sharks.
@DrewTurner73 @FullStance @Cernovich You know if I hear the slightest hint that the DEA is going to schedule Kratom where my feet will be planted, right in front of the US Capitol! Last year they were planted in front of the White House we're going to be taking a walk around the corner to the Capitol Building
@DrRobinFalkov @Cernovich But if more Dr took a stand and spoke out we the patients have been silenced and nobody is left to be our voice. I can't tell you how many doctors I've talked to who support Kratom but scared to talk about it

@FDAWomen Don't even get me started on the side effects from the 13 rx I was on 3 yrs ago. I was sick due to Pharma more than my disease.
@FDAWomen Everything comes with risk, walking across the street. Real herbalist will tell you contraindications with herbs and supplements before selling to you they will also ask your Rx list to ensure your on on any Rx that may have an interaction.
@SGottliebFDA 50 yrs ago there were far less diseases, your FDA oversight is killing and making America sick
@FDAOncology @SGottliebFDA @BloodJournal Chemo killed my 12 yr old step sister, not cancer. She died from over exposure to chemo. I am not trusting of any FDA approved drugs.

@headdock It has been in the US 22 years most consumers didn't want the public to know about it cuz they knew if the government saw how well it worked and how safe it was they would ban it, they were right. But I have to say it is very safe and much safer than opioids

@headdock There are a few people who do not get any effect from Kratom we believe after the research it has to do with the genetics of the person. Just like not every person who drinks is an alcoholic

@JRFarrell1 @realDonaldTrump Then chamomile, lavender, skullcap, magnolia, mulungu, is a drug. If you want your synthetic drugs so be it but don't force the rest of us to use them just because you want them
Do we look like addicts? Criminals? Felons? Future of kratom is at risk and so are our freedoms, don't make consumers criminals for choosing kratom over synthetics. @RandPaul @RepJohnYarmuth @SenateMajLdr @ChuckGrassley @SenSanders @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @SteveScalise https://t.co/TX1QhjcOpp

@POTUS @FLOTUS @PresOrinHatch @repmarkpocan @RepDaveBrat @RepJaredPolis @RepLoBiondo so they want to use kratom to make a drug but they want to make sure that regular responsible adults can't have the organic herb.  https://t.co/TMyshQe0XM
@SGottliebFDA is this why you're going after kratom? Your buddies can have it to make a drug but me a responsible adult can't have the organic herb! We support the FDA and regulating vendors who make claims. When it's spelled out like this it just smells https://t.co/TMyshQe0XM
@RepDLamborn Now we ask for you to turn your attention to Kratom and help us protect 5 million Americans who consume Kratom. Do we look like felons the FDA will make us felons if they banned kratom. Help us protect our health and choice what we put in our bodies. https://t.co/i7LxgXMrI2
