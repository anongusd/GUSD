@GaryKne728 Gary, you are absolutely right. Obamacare did NOT do a good job in lowering costs of health care. For many people, yes, premiums and deductibles rose. But how about people with life-threatening illnesses who couldn't receive medical care before?

@johnny_d33 @charliekirk11 @RebeccaSueNewe3 Considering that it takes an average of 6 years for doctor training, no. It will take a few years to adjust.
@johnny_d33 @charliekirk11 @RebeccaSueNewe3 The market takes time to adjust. And gov can certainly create incentives for students to go to medical school. They can also make it easier for foreign doctors to get certified. And increase the scope of work for PA's and nurses in primary care.
@johnny_d33 @charliekirk11 @RebeccaSueNewe3 People WITH insurance to make up for their losses after uninsured people fail to pay their outrageous bills. It makes NO sense.
@johnny_d33 @charliekirk11 @RebeccaSueNewe3 Johnny, no system is perfect. Canada has some wait time problems, sure.

@johnny_d33 @charliekirk11 @RebeccaSueNewe3 Sure, more people are getting medical treatment so wait times will have to increase until more doctors are brought into the market. Supply and demand. The solution isn't to keep people out of the market. The solution is to increase # of doctors.

@johnny_d33 @charliekirk11 @RebeccaSueNewe3 It is fundamentally different from an economic perspective from universal health care which is a buyer's market.
@johnny_d33 @charliekirk11 @RebeccaSueNewe3 I'm referring to the government as a single buyer under a universal health care system. Higher Ed is different because it's still a seller's market and gov aid is, yes as you say, in part fueling rising prices. I agree with your assessment of higher ed, but
@johnny_d33 @charliekirk11 @RebeccaSueNewe3 Healthcare is completely different because there is only one "buyer" (gov) and multiple "sellers" (doctors/hospitals), creating the inverse of a monopoly: a monopsony where buyer controls the prices. Very different from higher education
@johnny_d33 @charliekirk11 @RebeccaSueNewe3 And by the way, under a system like the Canadian system, the health care industry is still privatized. Hospitals, doctors and Rx companies won't be answering to the gov. They'll just have to lower the prices of their services.
@johnny_d33 @charliekirk11 @RebeccaSueNewe3 Because they're sick, and no one will die of a treatable illness because they're poor.
@johnny_d33 @charliekirk11 @RebeccaSueNewe3 The inevitable solution is universal healthcare. The government insuring everyone and becoming the only "buyer" of medical services gives them the negotiating power to lower prices and ensure access for all. Yes, taxes will rise. But no one will go bankrupt
@katelynstarrpdx Right on, Katelyn. We're also dealing with a large swath of the population that wants "Gov to take their filthy hands off my Medicare"...haha remember that? It's insane.
@johnny_d33 @charliekirk11 @RebeccaSueNewe3 Yes Johnny, the lower middle class right above the Medicaid/subsidy threshold is negatively affected. The ACA is far from perfect but we need to improve it, not scrap it.
@JoshuaCaudill85 @walterowensgrpa @charliekirk11 I disagree. If the Dems flip both houses and the WH in 2020, and if people overwhelmingly demand universal health care I think we can get this done.
@lexifiercegreen Alexandria, I sincerely hope you don't get seriously ill, or you'll amass loads of medical debt and ruin your financial future...or worse: not have access to medical care at all. I guess that's just the American way üòí
@JoshuaCaudill85 @walterowensgrpa @charliekirk11 Or here's a radical one for you: creating the ULTIMATE free market and allowing for reimportation of drugs from Canada to compete with US pharmaceuticals! Too bad both parties are bound to the Rx industry donors. üòí
@JoshuaCaudill85 @walterowensgrpa @charliekirk11 The solution is to build on Obamacare either through a public option to compete with private plans or universal healthcare...or a more politically difficult route--instituting price controls. But NO ONE should go bankrupt because they're sick.
@JoshuaCaudill85 @walterowensgrpa @charliekirk11 I'm totally on board with that, Joshua. Obamacare adversely affects lower middle class people who don't qualify for Medicaid or exchange subsidies and then get slapped with a fine. But we cannot go back to a time when sick people were denied access.
@TomiLahren I don't really believe you're ignorant enough to believe this massive redistribution of wealth to the top is in any way pro-working class. The Fox News machine succeeded in buying you out. Congratulations.
@AngeloItaliano4 @GOP @TheDemocrats I said I was a Leftist, not far- or alt-left. Huge difference. I condemn violence and hate on both sides.
@ME5ASH @cuelph @charliekirk11 @RebeccaSueNewe3 I mean, really, this is just simple logic.
@ME5ASH @cuelph @charliekirk11 @RebeccaSueNewe3 That is the definition of "insurance". Paying into a fund to protect the sick so that when YOU are sick, the healthy will protect you. The only alternative is for insurers to deny you when you get sick, and you having to declare bankruptcy and lose everything
@AngeloItaliano4 @GOP @TheDemocrats "Progressive" traditionally means pro-worker, and more recently is given to leftists who fall left of the Democratic Party. But no, the repeal of estate tax is absolutely not pro-worker and does not foster an equitable society.
@AngeloItaliano4 @GOP @TheDemocrats We have more in common than you think, Angelo. Leftists are pro-America, pro-small businesses, and pro-worker, just like the far Right.
@AngeloItaliano4 @GOP @TheDemocrats If you are referring to the tax bill's repatriation provision, I'm on board. We need to bring capital back to the US. That being said, that is the only positive, pro-working class part of the bill.
@oceanicdrummer Well they're called "entitlements" precisely because they're not means-tested--all workers regardless of income are entitled to benefits. I think most people know the difference, but you're right, there is a redistributive connotation among the Right.
@AngeloItaliano4 @GOP @TheDemocrats If @TheDemocrats don't scrap their neoliberal policy approach which puts big corporations before small business owners &amp; shareholders before workers and consumers, they can expect a repeat of 2016.
@SheltieDad Right, benefits that younger generations have paid into in the hopes that they'll be there when they themselves retire. @GOP wants to privatize them or scrap them altogether. Medicare and SS work great bc no one is making money off of them. That might change.
@AP_Politics And they don't care. The source of funding for the corporate tax breaks was never the mythical, projected economic growth, of course. It was the plan to cut entitlements. #SaveEntitlements

Hitler spent the beginning of his leadership improving Germany so people wouldn't question more radical policies planned
Remember: between 1933 &amp; 1936 German economy improved, infrastructure was built, morale/national pride increased...
Establishment situated in Berlin. And so the fight against establishment and liberalism began.
Hitler exploited sense of forgotteness &amp; ethnic superiority of provincial areas against liberal/intellectual culture of
Regions outside Berlin felt ignored by Weimar gov &amp; was suffering even more economic hardship...
Nazi party first gained fuel when provincial regions reacted against "morally depraved/liberal" culture of Berlin

Have been researching Weimar Germany and the early rise of Nazi party &amp; there are striking parallels w/ today's politics

@gmbbrwells This is no time for complicity. We need to call out the Right AND Left for their shortcomings.
Obamacare did NOT change the structure of the health care industry. Industry giants are still marking up prices by 1000%
However, the root cause of high prices is an industry that sets its own prices &amp; bankrupts even insured people.
To clarify: Obamacare was a great law--increased accessibility of health insurance for millions of people.
@pamgriffa I am a PROPONENT of Obamacare and STAUNCHLY OPPOSE REPEAL. But it didn't bring costs down--that's a FACT
Obama: The Solidly Status Quo President Who Squandered His Potential to Enact Change
@gmbbrwells Obama's lack of foresight to how eco inequality would erupt due to his complicity was his greatest failure
@gmbbrwells ...which supports my argument. While Obama adhered to the status quo, more radical forces were brewing
@JrHollis60 And yet, turned a blind eye to African Americans in Flint &amp; Native Americans in the Dakotas
But economic inequality, race relations and police brutality have greatly worsened.
I would argue that Obama's greatest achievements were made in diplomacy &amp; foreign policy.
Being the first black president had the POTENTIAL to change race relations, but Obama did not live up to this challenge
@ezraklein's second point was that merely being the first black president was monumental...
It was a band-aid solution with industry support and FDR &amp; LBJ would have found this "solution" laughable.
@ezraklein There was NOTHING radical about Obamacare. It had NO effect on the structure of US health care...
The first premise supporting this argument, acc to @ezraklein, was the monumentality of the #AffordableCareAct.
I find @ezraklein's assertion that President Obama is one of the most consequential presidents in US history problematic
Obama looks upon the blue-collar working class as lost causes. Sanders sees them as the backbone of America.
That is the fundamental difference between President Obama and Bernie Sanders.

What attracts the poor working class to the Rep party is, essentially, hope. (And as of late, racism).
Determinism naturally breeds empathy while belief in individual liberty naturally breeds disdain.
And at the philosophical core of liberalism is a pessimistic determinism.
At the philosophical core of conservatism is the Randian notion of free will &amp; unlimited choices.
If only conservatives understood that institutional structures create a very narrow set of choices for the disadvantaged

Problem with conservatives: failure to see peoples' conditions as a result of external STRUCTURES
We have so much more in common than the media allows us to believe. Our fight should be about economic equality. Simple.
