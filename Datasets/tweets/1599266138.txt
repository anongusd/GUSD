Thanks to @MollyJongFast for watching CPAC so I can sit here in my unruffled morning tuxedo and refuse to acknowledge Charlie Kirk's existence
@AOC @RepPressley There's so much rot in the Trump Organization - but it took us until two of the most junior legislators to ask a question about it.
@AOC @RepPressley Between them, Ocasio-Cortez and Pressley put Cohen on the record about at least 3(!) Trump golf courses involved in manipulating asset values. 		And they did it in under 10 minutes!
Credit to @AOC and @RepPressley - they're going straight for evidence of President Trump's involvement in tax evasion. 		Same stuff that brought down Capone
@AdamParkhomenko Boy I wonder if the ban on felons writing books extends to Iran-Contra crook and prolific author Oliver North
If @AOC conducted herself in the flailing, shouting way Jim Jordan did today, we'd be drowning in hot takes about whether women have the temperament to serve in Congress.
Rep. Jim Jordan, a "free market Republican" and Capitalist Defender, is absolutely disgusted that Michael Cohen might someday make money writing a book
As you hear Republicans labeling Michael Cohen the slimiest person to ever have slimed, remember they happily elected Cohen @GOP Deputy Finance Chairman, and defended him at the start of his legal problems.
Are "law and order" Republicans really bullying Michael Cohen for...working with Mueller and SDNY?
Jody Hice has nothing meaningful to add to this hearing. He's doing the equivalent of pedantically correcting Cohen's grammar
@karenhunter I'd be ashamed to admit the GOP showing was a coordinated effort. Too many questions being asked that are just flying out of their control.
JORDAN: Why didn't you join the White House team, loser?		COHEN: Trump told me it'd be easier to cover up crimes this way.		JORDAN: https://t.co/V1yHylE9HX

Understanding how privilege biased and limited his view is part of what turned Robert F. Kennedy into the icon he became for people. Great summary: https://t.co/BZKun2XmDG
Kennedy didn't claim to understand fully what was happening. He knew that would be arrogant and stupid.		It's also why his national listening tour is (unsuccessfully) emulated by every aspiring candidate since 1968.
The revolving door doesn't discriminate. Hiring reprehensible voices to preserve access/relationships w/ power is the worst way to run a media company. https://t.co/tRV1r8eaUZ

@AOC @RFKHumanRights On the same day Donald Trump announced an end to his family separation policy, we saw 70 migrants file into an immigration courtroom, where unaccompanied brothers were separated from unaccompanied sisters. 		That was in June 2018. It's only getting worse.
@AOC @RFKHumanRights spent a week in McAllen and tried visiting the Ursula Detention Center. 		We saw family separation firsthand in an immigration courtroom. We saw children being bused away from Ursula without their parents. This immigration policy is inhumanity as law.
@meredith_bohen @_stefanijones @AOC Don't let the haters get you down, live your truth
@AP Well, as long as we're depending on those rock-solid "@GOP principles" to guide us... 👀
@AOC @jwgop @NathanHRubin @joanwalsh There have been enough immigrant kids torn from their parents for TV anchors to close EVERY program with a different horror story from Tornillo or Camp Ursula.		Trump's covfefes probably wouldn't seem so funny after that.
@AOC It's also why I appreciate voices like @jwgop, @NathanHRubin &amp; @joanwalsh, who don't mince words about the serious damage Donald Trump is doing to so many people. 		They don't giggle about how dumb Trump is. They highlight the suffering Trump causes.
This is a big part of the disillusionment with corporate media that people like @AOC tap into so effectively. 		It's draining to see Trump treated as cable news entertainment while the most vulnerable pay for his totally unfocused policies.
I don't get media who insist on treating Trump as some hilarious buffoon.		Trump policies have torn apart thousands of immigrant families and harmed millions of Americans at home and serving abroad. 		He's not a TV laugh line.

No one has a handle on process and party management like Nancy Pelosi. Threats from the left taste a lot like the cynical power games played by the Tea Party in 2010.

There are a lot of strong Democrats who speak to our values - but none with the legislative and coalition building prowess of Nancy Pelosi. 		There's a reason she's at the top of the @GOP villain list. It's because she's great at her job.

If ANYTHING is true, it's that the alt-right has Roman citizenship law precisely backwards. There is nothing LESS Roman than turning down those who want to share your identity and help you grow your economic and military might.
And Roman Christianity itself, gaining power into the 400s as the Western Empire fell, adopted an expansive view of citizenship that went beyond even the Empire. The idea that birthright citizenship isn't "historical" is a joke.
By the great alt-right Golden Age of Constantine, where white Christians began their ascendancy, the idea of birthright citizenship was pretty well established in Rome. The children of non-citizens were becoming citizens all the time!
After Caracalla, nearly every emperor expanded citizenship further - with Diocletian and Constantine in the late 200s/early 300s expanding some rights to Christians, additional rights to women, and opening up some imperial positions to non-citizens.
Anyway, in 212 the Emperor Caracalla had a problem: his allied tribes were starting to think twice about their commitments to Rome. The Crisis of the 3rd Century is coming. 		So Caracalla issued an Executive Order - all free men living within the Empire were citizens.
And not all citizens had the same rights! Of course there was the 'lus suffragiorum,' the right to vote. But there was also a 'lus commercii,' the right to make a contract. Or the 'lus conubii,' the right to marry.
But here's a problem - there were never really enough Roman citizens. Rome was heavily dependent on allied armies coming to the support of the Legions. And one of the easiest political wins for a new Emperor was expanding citizenship to a supporter base.
You can see the remnants of the old system of the Roman Republic/Principate in the USA, where we offer expedited naturalization through military service. https://t.co/VzVdgPkW5Y
Citizenship was a valuable commodity in the early Principate of Augustus, given for conspicuous military gallantry, service in a combat auxiliary (allies), or any number of poorly legally defined reasons.
Back in the day, pretty much only the tribes of Italy had Roman citizenship - you most likely had it because Rome conquered your town some time in the distant past. This goes for Samnites, Veiites, the Italics, the Latins, and a ton of Greeks.
White supremacists like to harken back to Ancient Rome as the cradle of pure Western glory. Here are some fun facts about "jus soli," the Roman practice of birthright citizenship:

I'll join @foxandfriends at 6:20 this morning to ask a simple question: why did it take Jeff Flake's revolt to get the @GOP on board with investigating Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault claims?
Boy it's a good thing the President of the United States hasn't spent nearly two years discrediting the FBI in the eyes of many Americans.
If that's how Kavanaugh treats Klobuchar in public, imagine how nasty he gets when there's no camera.
@JWGOP Right? https://t.co/2kvGgU1RhE
NOTHING Kavanaugh is saying about his commitment to academics and sports precludes him from also drunkenly sexually assaulting someone
Kavanaugh needs a break already? I wonder if he has the stamina to serve on the Supreme Court.
@rabiasquared 🔥
@jacobtwop I was unsure if this was the real Erik Estrada from CHiPs but the handle confirms it.
Jesus, imagine if Dr. Ford behaved this way at the microphone. She'd be called shrill, unhinged, loony, bizarre, furious, fuming, and "too emotional" to be trusted.
Brett Kavanaugh collapsing into self pity and whining because his accusers didn't testify at his convenience and on his timetable.
Dr. Ford did everything our society told her to do to report a sexual assault. And this public travesty is her reward.

@epicciuto On the other hand, the spelling is definitely better.
@nosusanhere Bot asked a good question and there's a good answer ready.
@JustBirdTweetin It's a justiciability question - hard to imagine this wouldn't fall plainly under a political question.
Every other woman in his life except:		- The women swearing under oath about his predatory behavior	- The women who backed away from that "65 women for Brett" note	- His female Yale classmates calling for a full investigation	- Senator Lisa Murkowski https://t.co/lTklmE1GkH
The ONLY reason the facts are coming out about Kavanaugh?		Because fearless women like Ford and Swetnick are willing to destroy their own lives to provide vital evidence. And STILL Senate Republicans obstruct, attack and attempt to muzzle their voices.
@thegarance Thank you!
@wfederman Someone has a very high opinion of cable TV discourse.
Republicans already decided that having Kavanaugh on the court is worth being wiped out electorally.		They know how much Kavanaugh can do with a lifetime seat. They're willing to lose a few cycles to gain that power.
@wfederman *says
@NBCPolitics uh what
How do we know #MeToo hasn't "gone too far"? 		Because the @GOP response to Kavanaugh's allegations was secrecy and oppo research on potential victims - not transparency and investigation.		https://t.co/L69wnhZRdD

And those firefighters and police officers felt completely comfortable around Jon. He was one of the guys. He'd proven his loyalty to them on television and in private. 		That's what patriotism is. Speaking truth to power. Knowing when something is wrong. And fighting it.

For what it's worth, I've never heard someone speak to a U.S. Senator - Democrat and Republican alike - the way Jon spoke to those Senators. They were stunned at his anger and his command of the facts.
"I'm here, basically, to apologize." Here's Jon on Capitol Hill, speaking out for those firefighters, police officers, FBI, paramedics forgotten by Congress. He's an incredible man. https://t.co/V07wVmWLwn
Jon doesn't have Twitter, but @StephenAtHome does, and I know he had a front row seat to how tirelessly Jon worked alongside 9/11 heroes to pressure Congress for basic decency. And they won. God bless them all.		Never make those responders grovel again.

NEW: @RFKHumanRights 	Prez @KerryKennedyRFK heading to McAllen, TX for weekend of action for the undocumented child and family victims of Donald Trump's inhumane immigration policies.
Imagine the outcry among Republicans if the inhumanity shown to undocumented children was visited for one tiny moment on white children.

A happy birthday to @RepDonBeyer! Congressman, you continue to be a mentor and a guide to what the proper moral response is to the inhumanity of Donald Trump's immigration crisis. Congress is better because of your leadership.
Exciting news to share tomorrow about @RFKHumanRights, the immigration crisis and how we double down the pressure to end @RealDonaldTrump's inhumane family separation policy.

After crying "Munich!"and "Appeaser!" every time a Democrat opposed the excesses of the War on Terror, the @GOP obediently bends its knee to actual authoritarianism in our homeland.
Our national immune system response to sadistic policies like family separation and child internment camps stands in sharp contrast to the spineless, authoritarian appeasement of the @GOP.
This country went from Barack Obama's tan suit to child concentration camps SO FAST
"It's unfair to call me an authoritarian just because I advance authoritarian policies," said the bewildered Trump-enabling Republican
The sickest part of this is how @GOP lawmakers get WAY angrier about being called xenophobes than they get about forcibly separating immigrant children from their families.

@MsShannonFisher Angering your audience by refusing to bend to their sometimes ridiculous partisanship is the best part of Twitter.
@prabhbob it's Twitter - a lot of people ARE doing just that.
@prabhbob In that case, yes, I wish I had said "While celebrating," though it isn't the worst idea to at least pause for a moment and consider situations like this are rarely as simple as "racist held somewhat accountable for her disgusting behavior."
@prabhbob Am I okay with it? No. No part of it.		Am I going to stand over someone in a worse financial situation and tell them they should pass on a job and an income they may acutely need because the job is a moral conflict for them? No, I won't.
@prabhbob It doesn't have to be an either-or. People who lack the economic freedom to make free choices as to where they work, compromising their moral compasses in the process, are hurt as well. There's no reason we can't look at both of those as in need of serious repair.
@prabhbob It may be helpful for all of us to try and talk to these people, see what they felt, why they took the job, why they stayed, and what their circumstances were. These voices have so far been totally overlooked in media narratives.
@prabhbob It's easy to forget many who - even in entry-level TV - don't have the financial privilege to maintain moral purity when they're in need of a paycheck. Especially when presented with a chance by a showrunner like Bruce Helford.
@prabhbob I'm in full support of Barr losing her show over her disgusting racism. It's a sad statement on the selfishness and narcissism of racism that she took a lot of people who depended on that show for their paycheck down as well.
@anoutlawlife A lot of people lack the financial privilege to choose employers who align with their moral compass. That's like implying everyone at Hobby Lobby is pro-life. That's the reality of not having money.
@TheNakedPenman @ABCNetwork A fair number of those techs already worked with ABC and moved on to the project. I'd be very interested to hear more from them, as the stories of working class and behind-the-camera folks are rarely covered in these situations.
@JabbaUnchained @therealroseanne Yep. On top of being a ridiculous racist, Roseanne's selfishness screwed a whole lot of not-racist regular people.
Before celebrating, realize @therealroseanne's racism just cost a lot of good production and writing people their jobs. Those people aren't rich.
YOU, FOOLISH: "Donald Trump has a new tweet."		ME, SMART: https://t.co/rfJgnzzHoR
That we question AT ALL the idea that an undocumented immigrant parent has a right to custody of their child is an example of just how quickly this moral rot has leeched into the very bones of government agencies.
Roman history teaches us that a Trump isn't just dangerous when subverting law. Historical Trumps undermine tradition, hollow out institutional dignity and leave people questioning the morals/values of their entire system That's REAL cultural harm.

And @matt_latimer, who taught me to cut extraneous words and craft a speech, an op-ed, a position paper. To use parallelism well. To never condescend to an audience. To explain and persuade in the same line.
And @MattHindman who, in the end, was right and I was wrong in his assessment of the risks posed to civil society by the Internet and social media. Sometimes the simplest explanations are the right ones.
And @nikkiusher, with her cutting insights into the media and the cultural structures that hem us in, so often without our knowledge. I'd never have understood Adorno without her patient stewardship and willingness to simplify.
And @ploge, who taught the difference between education and learning. I have him to thank for Barthes, Baudrillard, Levi-Strauss. Loge is a ranting, brilliant figure who reminds me to never forget, "this could all just be wrong."
At SMPA, @ICTlivingston made advocacy not just an idealistic pursuit, but a technical skill grounded in data and issue mastery. He instilled in me a respect fro the power of theory - and the flexibility to move forward when theory fails.
As an undergrad at George Mason, @RealDeanB's international relations classes taught me the difference between good policy and just policy. He held nothing back, and demanded excellence. Only in recent years do I fully appreciate the scope of what he offered us.

As I said on @foxandfriends: the 3.9% rate masks the fact those gains aren't distributed very evenly. A lot of Trump Country (AZ, AK, WV) aren't sharing the benefit. Even for places that DO see more jobs, wages are stagnant vs. inflation. https://t.co/4koMS3EtYt

First Lady funerals NOT attended by a sitting POTUS:		Barbara Bush (2018)	Nancy Reagan (2016)	Betty Ford (2011)	Ladybird Johnson (2007)	Pat Nixon (1993)
@Vallmeister @KathyDuke65 Could be a security inconvenience, but from what I can tell in my quick scan, it's been almost a quarter century since a sitting president attended a First Lady's funeral. Which DOES seem odd.
@Vallmeister @KathyDuke65 I'm not sure - as far as I can tell, the only recent one a sitting POTUS has attended was Jackie Kennedy's funeral in 1994.
@Vallmeister It's not JUST Obama - President Clinton didn't attend Pat Nixon's funeral, and President Obama didn't attend Betty Ford's funeral. The general practice seems to be against a sitting president attending.
@KathyDuke65 @Vallmeister I just don't see why we condemn one decision when sitting presidents generally haven't attended the funerals of former First Ladies - as was the case for Pat NIxon and Betty Ford in addition to Nancy Reagan and Barbara BUsh.
@Vallmeister Just pointing out that it's not an unprecedented decison, since emotions around both decisions ran pretty high.

@213thBattalion That's definitely a valid position to stake out in the much larger debate about the origins of morality. A discussion of first principles along those lines might require more than a Twitter thread.
@kimeekat @MillenPolitics The Pew data has a lot of interesting stuff, including data for Pagans/Wiccans/unaffiliated spiritual/etc. It's really cool: https://t.co/zbm2nOxvQu
The trouble with an "is-ought" like this is that it dodges the first principle. 		If you believe there is NEVER an acceptable case for the state to execute an innocent, you can't say "Let's keep the system going while we maybe improve it down the line." https://t.co/bAovGmFWCd
Yes - we SHOULD discuss this kind of misuse. I absolutely agree. More people should understand &amp; engage with it. That's the best way to begin empowering a better approach to faith &amp; social justice. https://t.co/oKlpAGf51T
I think any exploration of meaning in faith is far more powerful if we DON'T ignore the dangers of strict literalism.		We can't hope to approach first principles in a clear way unless we're discussing &amp; engaging with our fallibility. https://t.co/BQDqcLQxqr
I disagree. Engaging with the meaning &amp; implications of the Bible (and all moral philosophy) is a great help in ENGAGING with modern ethics.		It's on us to interpret, debate, engage, apply, and deepen our moral vocabulary. https://t.co/E9zuI3tgVF
Not sure I ever defended rigid Biblical literalism in my article. And I certainly didn't say moral philosophy and science couldn't coexist. 		I don't know who you're arguing with. https://t.co/Q4jzJA6Bmc
I'm saying it's a moral cop-out to have it both ways. 		If it's fundamentally wrong for the state to execute an innocent person, I can't defend a system that has that as an inevitable outcome. https://t.co/nprxvOUO0g
We're not disagreeing on the idea that literalism is not especially helpful in engaging with the deeper meaning of religious texts. https://t.co/Avhvoi65Sa
I'm not arguing a "slippery slope." The ethical question is simple: is there an acceptable number of innocents executed by the state in order to maintain capital punishment? 		I believe that number is zero. https://t.co/SWt1QaKpSz

Then continue to do good in your community! Unlike those who toxified religion in America, I'm not here to threaten or bully you. https://t.co/71kZrTVEAl
@ploge @SMPAGWU Thank you!
As I point out in my article, I understand why you feel that way. The toxified political faith that soaked into our culture is in dire need of a cleansing and a return to first principles. Humanism and faith can be dual engines for good. https://t.co/STw581grsN
Thanks for reading, Rev. Howard! https://t.co/zyuTbc6J2L
Faith can be a reinforcement of these principles instead of a gutted, empty obstruction captured by divisive opportunists. Doesn't need to be a binary - we should have as many positive channels for these ideals as possible. https://t.co/FiQ7962bw6
I completely agree with you, and thank you reading! Also a great opportunity to highlight the great work of @Sojourners in reconnecting with the social justice message fundamental to faith. https://t.co/FdHf4cMwts

@ebruenig Strict Neutrality Horse
@ElliottRHams I understand your position. But in matters of execution, I can't accept a fallible standard. So in my approach, I have to abandon execution. My conception of a nation governed by law is that one flawed execution is too many.
@ElliottRHams It is imperfect, yes. And I can't stand behind giving the state the authority to kill an individual if we all acknowledge that judgment is imperfect. There is no restorative justice for a wrongful execution.
In a society built on the supremacy and inerrancy of law, one innocent incorrectly put to death by the state is too many to bear. Wouldn't you agree? https://t.co/8owO5he2Td
@ElliottRHams I genuinely hope you are never in the position too many have found themselves in, facing that judgment incorrectly. Even exonerated, the falsely condemned never fully recover from the psychological blow.
A system of laws has no place for hot-blooded revenge - especially when it periodically misses the mark and kills the innocent. 		God forbid, were you ever falsely on trial for a capital crime, I would advocate for you the same as any. https://t.co/lCLKdMG7HO
What you're describing is vengeance, not justice. The false promise that taking a life will make me feel better for having a life taken from me. https://t.co/FKc2RhRDKZ
