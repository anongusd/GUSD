@MxHarperion Exactly! Definitely a HUGE difference between fatigue and tired. Not even close to the same thing. When a wave of fatigue hits me, it starts in the brain and sweeps through the body and there better be a place to collapse or you're hitting the floor.
#ThingsDisabledPeopleKnow When the best medication for pain, considering you have 3 separate pain conditions, is marijuana, eating it or oil, but your state won't give you legality and access, then if they do, Medicaid won't pay for it. It's medicine, dammit!!
#ThingsDisabledPeopleKnow Parking in a disabled spot when you LOOK normal, but still you can't walk halfway across a parking lot, while being the caretaker of your mentally disabled ADULT son, so your workload and responsibilities are doubled, if not tripled. Lord, I'm tired.
