@AnnieGe03567828 Absolutely agree that it's a hurtful word but it's a word. Point is when you have worries like making rent, feeding your family on an everyday basis, that overshadows political correctness. Seems liberals concern themselves more with PC than finding a way to explain why it hurts.
@realDonaldTrump You don't even read. Period.
@Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Republican voters, we invite you to truth. Really look at both sides through your own eyes &amp; ears. By trying to stick it to the libs, you are actually sticking it to yourself. #WeThePeople

@SethAbramson I think we need to explore that whole law of attraction psychology. We attract who we are &amp; how we are perceived by others. Or the old fashioned walks like a ü¶Ü, talks like a ü¶Ü, it's a ü¶Ü. #Republican voters, please join #WeThePeople as we take our democracy back!
@McdNotorious @BarberTrump @AdamSchiff Republican voters have a responsibility to our national security as well. Whether we think they will do anything or not, we should still ask for their help. Strength in numbers, we the people.
For those who are not open, I can't change that. However, if you still think you need to stick it to the libtards, that's not the results you'll get anymore. Independents &amp; Democrats are moving forward with evidence presented. Please join us, let's get back to we the people.
Words hurt. Being grouped as bad people hurts. Ignorance of others keeps us in a prison of any phobia you can name. This goes for all sides. Start small, ask questions, be agreeable with common interests. Be willing to learn from others. Find a way for all of us to have a win-win
My guess is no. As @billmaher points out, maybe just maybe you're the group feeling left out &amp; afraid &amp; unwelcome? It's like the popular kids having a party &amp; you're not invited. So you crash it in not only destructive ways for them but for you as well. In turn, no peace.
The liberals are enjoying life through education, thought, debate, surviving hate, finding their voice to help themselves &amp; others. There are people, who want your loyalty by giving you unsubstantiated lip service. Think though, would you tolerate a liberal lying all the time?
Why can't we talk &amp; listen to each other? I say something from a Republican perspective &amp; I get made fun of by liberals. I say something from a liberal perspective, the name calling &amp; assumptions ensue. Annoying but #independentvoter fo life! My point...
Who can blame you? Liberals call you stupid, dumb, racist, homophobic, make fun of you, laugh at your religious beliefs, smite your constitutional God-given rights, they call your fears irrational &amp; silly, dare I say it? Gaslighting what you believe you've seen &amp; known.
I get it. You dig in deeper out of pure stubbornness. Now it's about blinding yourself to any evidence, about withholding conviction of right or wrong. This is all I can come up with on why you support Trump. Pure stubbornness at your own personal detriment. Why do that to you?
Blue collar, hard working people who deal with real hardships everyday. When you have to decide between groceries or mortgage some months, how could you not resent when the libs are hollering about gun control &amp; racism. When I see some problems as stages for outrage, annoyed!!
Before I go on, I have to give @billmaher credit for inspiring me to post this. I can't pinpoint which episodes he said these things. Basically he said those who remain loyal blindly to President Trump are the same ones HRC talked about whom she called #Deplorables.
The base of constituents who relished in @realDonaldTrump "sticking it to the libtards" by beating HRC...you've got your glory! As you remain complicit to everything being revealed lately, you are sticking it to yourselves now. How's that? Hear me out please.

@senatemajldr @POTUS Please bring #HJRes46 to the Senate floor for a vote even though @WhiteHouse threatens to veto it. I want record of who opposed this bill by @JoaquinCastrotx. #FakeEmergency #ComplicitGOP had Congress for 2 years. Some of you might be getting a little too big for your britches.
@WhenXLM @LindseyGrahamSC @VP @realDonaldTrump @SenCoryGardner @SenatorBennet @RepJasonCrow @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr I'm not disputing @CBP has needs.

7/ to vote on this bill, I hope you will support Representative Castro's push to end this fake emergency power grab by the President. We don't want to reward his behavior even if he is threatening to veto this bill. Thank you.
6/ based on evidence and requests from Department of Homeland Security needs. If we need a better fence and border identification in certain areas, I support that as well. However, my tax dollars should NOT be used in eminent domain lawsuits from land owners. When it comes time
5/ Congressional spending appropriations WITH OUR TAX DOLLARS. President Trump said it himself, "I don't need to do this but I wanted it done faster" (paraphrase). How is that an emergency when it's really about a broken campaign promise? I fully support better border security
4/ system, in turn creating Congressional branch and Judicial branch as co-equal with the Executive branch. It's as if President Trump hears there is something he can do so he tries it to see what happens. Show him what happens when the Executive branch tries to overpower
3/ I left a vm last night regarding this bill. As an independent voter, I oppose the fake Trump emergency. When a POTUS declares a national emergency, he/she is no longer under Congressional &amp; Judicial oversight any longer. Our founding fathers feared a totalitarian government
2/ Here is what I sent to my representatives, feel free to copy or add in what you want. @realDonaldTrump administration is threatening to veto this bill before @GOP lead Senate has a vote. #FakeTrumpEmergency as well as threats from the Executive branch are unconstitutional.
1/ Are you against any #POTUS abusing their executive powers to usurp Congressional authority in how our tax dollars are appropriated? Call and write your representatives to tell them your thoughts. Tell them to support @JoaquinCastrotx bill to end this #FakeEmergency #HJRes46

@UtilityAutonomy @glenn_wofford @NRA @SteveScalise @BarackObama Interesting you bring up Stalinist plan. I didn't. I never said guns should be confiscated.

@glenn_wofford @UtilityAutonomy @NRA @SteveScalise @BarackObama I originally responded about how the victims should have the floor &amp; able to speak out. I misspoke on 10 years, it's actually 8 years since they've had the floor. Automatically NRA starts riling up gun owners that they'll lose their gun rights.
@glenn_wofford @SteveScalise It was the worst day of my life. Actually, this shooting was the impetus for the military to change policies on kicking mentally ill people out of the military. All the signs were there had there been a background check when he purchased the assault rifle.
@glenn_wofford @UtilityAutonomy @NRA @SteveScalise @BarackObama It's hard for me to follow along on all the responses by people who have no idea who I am or who you are.

@QuillenJoyce @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Because it would cost over $30 billion, not 5.7 billion so it wouldn't be a secure wall anyway, it's a con.

@nunyabizniss76 @DonaldJTrumpJr You just don't get it. I'm an Independent voter btw. Feinstein said  over 50% of illegals are people that overstay their visas. You know, like Melania? The rest enter in all kinds of illegals ways other than the Southern border. Hence the diagram.
@DonaldJTrumpJr There is border patrol &amp; ICE along the southern border.
@nunyabizniss76 @DonaldJTrumpJr Let me give you a remedial explanation...getting into the U.S. is possible despite a wall on the southern border. Quit projecting.
@DonaldJTrumpJr https://t.co/ZG0QEWEqE9
@ric_holiusa Point is I'm saying I care about victims families. Sorry if that doesn't fit in your narrative.
@ric_holiusa I know this. However, the lawyers &amp;  courts do interpret the rule of law during legislation of policies.
@Cernovich @AnnCoulter I only get a certain amount of words so chill. Sorry if my message of I care about victims families doesn't fit your narrative.
@Cernovich @AnnCoulter Angel parents plight is crucial in arguing for immigration reform &amp; border security. How can that happen during a shutdown? #Trumpshutdown is about a campaign promise that won't work. Re-open the govt so Congress &amp; Judicial branch can create policies &amp; solutions that work!

@cbh033 @talktodenene MIT estimated the true cost of building a wall &amp; I believe this is before buying land, before buying equipment surveillance, before hiring &amp; training more patrol agents...$38 billion. Not $5 billion.
@cbh033 @talktodenene 5. Which brings us to never believe a con man saying building a structure would only cost $5 billion when he is currently being sued by former contractors he has stiffed in his privately owned businesses. Cont'd...
@cbh033 @talktodenene 4. Back to 3, for those reasons along with imminent domain legal costs on land that can hold a wall structure, tax payers are looking at costs exceeding $5 billion.
@cbh033 @talktodenene 3. Southern states are known for being a dry climate, with rough mountainous terrain. To build a solid wall, it would have stand up to flooding, desert tsunamis if you will.
@cbh033 @talktodenene 2. Walls don't work. Even border patrol says it would hinder their surveillance equipment. Walls have not worked throughout history. People that want to cross will swim, tunnel or climb over it.
@cbh033 @talktodenene 1. "Mexico will pay for the wall."

@PostOpinions @marcthiessen So I read both and I felt like I was watching a pharmaceutical commercial. Sure this medicine will clear your skin but you'll get raging diarrhea, heart palpitations, &amp; you will glow at night. His bad outweighs any good he tried to do.
@BaerliLover @cleep03 @theMMQB @JennyVrentas @johnelway @EgoElway Elway didn't want to go through the process of hiring a HC because he couldn't just hire Shanahan. That's called lazy and neglectful. If it was any other GM than Elway, Broncos fans would be flipping out!
@BaerliLover @cleep03 @theMMQB @JennyVrentas @johnelway @EgoElway There is definitely some logic with what you're saying since Shanahan is not a contender right now. The only thing I can come up with is Pat Bowlen fired Shanahan and Ellis wants to keep Bowlen's wishes from the past.
@cleep03 @BaerliLover @theMMQB @JennyVrentas @johnelway @EgoElway You can't just hire any head coach you want on your own whim without major consequences to the franchise. @Elway chose to keep V.J. instead but let's Ellis take the heat.	https://t.co/8gJuApu3jJ	https://t.co/V0yTelqRzN
@cleep03 @BaerliLover @theMMQB @JennyVrentas @johnelway @EgoElway Elway and Shanahan made amends...	https://t.co/Pjh2cS9bfo
@cleep03 @BaerliLover @theMMQB @JennyVrentas @johnelway @EgoElway Nope, Elway &amp; Shanahan repaired their relationship &amp; decided to put their differences aside. Elway didn't want to go through the Rooney Rule interview process for head coaches so he stuck with V.J.
@cleep03 @BaerliLover @theMMQB @JennyVrentas @johnelway @EgoElway A lot of it is public knowledge now based on an article by Woody Paige. Elway fanboys would rather blame Ellis &amp; Elway is letting it happen. Real friend to Joe Ellis there huh?
@BaerliLover @cleep03 @theMMQB @JennyVrentas @johnelway @EgoElway OMG, Ellis handles the business side,  avoiding lawsuits &amp; paying fines. Therefore, he's going to tell your idol he can't just hire Shanahan, he has to go through the Rooney Rule process first. Elway chose not to &amp; stick with V.J. what other word would you call it? Careless?
@HillaryLeitch @theMMQB @JennyVrentas @johnelway Well ya know, he is unable to draft or trade or grab someone in free agency that might be better than he was on the field.
@kylerlw15 @CoachAlinden @theMMQB @JennyVrentas @Broncos Kyler, we can agree on that though. :) He's not completely off the hook.
@theMMQB @JennyVrentas Thought you might like this article...#Elwayfanboys everywhere just because it's him as the chosen picture for this topic lol	@dmac1043 @MikeEvans1043
@CoachAlinden @kylerlw15 @theMMQB @JennyVrentas @Broncos Huh? https://t.co/WofsNk2XJC
@HillaryLeitch @theMMQB @JennyVrentas I used to think the same thing but firing him would create fanboy riots all over the city. He is so tight with Joe Ellis, was very tight with Pat Bowlen, not going to happen. But, @johnelway could recognize his own GM limitations and step aside on personnel &amp; player decisions.
@BaerliLover @cleep03 @theMMQB @JennyVrentas @johnelway @EgoElway He was allowed to but unable to hire just any HC due to the Rooney Rule. Again laziness, he didn't want to go through right process.
@kylerlw15 @CoachAlinden @theMMQB @JennyVrentas #Elwayfanboys	It was PFM that got the Broncos to SB. And it was #JohnFox and #BrianXanders that pursued PFM when he was a free agent. It was PFM that attracted the greatest #noflyzone defense @Broncos ever had.
@BaerliLover @cleep03 @theMMQB @JennyVrentas @johnelway heavily pursued VJ. Totally on him. He was too lazy to go through the interview process on finding reputable experienced HC's for the most qualified. Clearly VJ was not qualified but @EgoElway wanted a yes man. Backfired.

@1043TheFan No real opinion on the candidates. My concern is the process.

@NickiJhabvala https://t.co/yuLwAWTvOU
@HafenChristine @gino_peters @dmac1043 @johnelway The only way we can know if for Elway to step aside and back to VP and business development, hire someone who wants the challenge. John Fox and Brian Xanders woo'd PFM to get here. Xanders picked Von Miller. There has to be other guys like him if he didn't want to come back.
@HafenChristine @gino_peters @dmac1043 @johnelway I wouldn't go as far as firing Elway, do you know how much the fanboys would riot?!? He's a familiar face for the franchise during this unstable ownership. However, he'd do the team a favor by cutting his losses and stepping away from picking personnel and players.
@HafenChristine @gino_peters @dmac1043 @johnelway Fair enough but let's face it, when Elway wanted to get into the executive side of the Bronco's franchise, even he admitted publicly he did not want to do the GM job. Yet he is GM and doing poorly. Those historic defensive players came over because of PFM.
@HafenChristine @gino_peters @dmac1043 Those wins fall on #PeytonManning, not @johnelway. Who got Manning on the Broncos roster?

@teatimewithT123 @IamObsidianJay @dvilpawn @realDonaldTrump Based on that argument, you pretty much admitted that even after spending billions on a new infrastructure, we'd still need to continue spending on border security. We technically have a line of demarcation along the border that are walls. People use other means to cross it.
@teatimewithT123 @IamObsidianJay @dvilpawn @realDonaldTrump You are asserting the point that walls work so it's up to you to prove there are 60 or so places that work.
@teatimewithT123 @IamObsidianJay @dvilpawn @realDonaldTrump Yes there is but the process is understaffed &amp; can take longer than necessary to get matters handled in a more humane timeframe.
@teatimewithT123 @IamObsidianJay @dvilpawn @realDonaldTrump Do you have any idea of how that would boost the economy in some of the economically depressed areas along the border? People with steady paychecks purchase confidently.
@DanCrenshawTX Me in the other corner https://t.co/lS3NqqxUyZ
@teatimewithT123 @IamObsidianJay @dvilpawn @realDonaldTrump We have a wall. Those trying to enter illegally or seeking asylum find ways to get through it, under it, over it, around it. A new wall still won't stop it from continuing to happen so I think the money could be better used. Train &amp; recruit more into border  security.

Trump is so dead set on a wall as the only viable solution to border security that he can't negotiate other ideas proposed last year &amp; this year by the Senate &amp; the House.

@TroyRenck I thought the games with the @Browns &amp; @49ers were automatic wins this season so that could have been the 2. @Chargers are on fire and playing for positions in playoffs so that's a loss. @Raiders, no idea WTF they're doing each game lol but they seem like an automatic win?
@markschlereth When has Joe Ellis had authority over John Elway?? The conspiracy side of my brain says this is BS. This must have been put in Woody's ear by Elway camp to release him from the heat on his ego.
@realDonaldTrump What time are you going into work today?
@realDonaldTrump It's spelled BORDER. 	#RESIGN
@realDonaldTrump Still haven't seen any replacement solution so I don't believe you or #ComplicitGOP that you have a plan to help people.
@jfleisch22 @dmac1043 Yeah seems shady.
@dmac1043 Perhaps there is something I am missing here....I was under the impression Joe Ellis is known for lacking spine???? Not sure where I got that. But anyway, why would he turn down Mike Shanahan? The history I know is Mr Bowlen let him go.

@dmac1043 He's sitting in a pretty good spot right now where no one of authority can keep him accountable. This means no one is telling him he's failing as a GM &amp; should retire. His ego will never allow himself to self-check or relinquish power to a popular Peyton Manning.
@MTorgove @dmac1043 @johnelway @Broncos By competing, they lost by 1 point instead of getting rolled over. Plus @casekeenum stepped up to be more aggressive instead of safe like he was challenged to do.
@dmac1043 And what kind of experienced HC &amp; reputable QB would come here under Elway AND Manning???? NONE. Back to the drawing board.
@dmac1043 I started asking what would Elway's job be then without proofreading lol!	Then I saw your next tweet about him doing ownership duties. I say no. It would undermine everything Bowlen wanted to do through the Trust. Elway is all about Elway.

@happykt @RepJayapal If US citizens WANT &amp; REQUEST the help, it's theirs. So many avenues to help someone if they TAKE it. Some don't for various reasons.

@AdamSchefter @MikeKlis I'm going to remain optimistic. Players we didn't know would step up have this season. Players we thought would not turn things around individually have this season. I hope for a quick recovery for @ChrisHarrisJr , love him!
@MSignorile Sounds like you're exploiting his death for your own agenda since he is trending right now.

@myrcellasear @YNB Because she is corrupt in her own right. She has done her fair share of irresponsible acts. I don't like her or Cheetos.
RT @ajplus: Acting Attorney General Sally Yates stood up to President Trump's immigration ban ... so he fired her. https://t.co/GZyLdQZx8Y
@YNB I was targeting my disagreement that she was a better option. Both candidates were equally bad. üòû
@YNB As a veteran, I respectfully disagree. I understand sexist voters was why she didn't get votes. However, that's not the only reason.
@realDonaldTrump oh honey, and the Judicial branch is just about to get started too. Do you even Constitution Brah?
