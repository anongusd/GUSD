This cynical rhetoric of war, of invasions, of fear — totally disconnected from the truth — has led us to treat our fellow humans in the most inhumane way. And it hasn’t made us safer. We thought we could sacrifice some of our humanity for security, we risk losing both.
Not only that, but walls and militarization of the border have resulted in the deaths of thousands of migrants, including children. We are pushing desperate families to cross in ever more hostile terrain. We are ensuring greater suffering and death.	https://t.co/8v5NKNzQ8H
And, by the way, none of this stuff has worked. As the border became more militarized, and deadlier, immigrants stopped returning to their home countries. In effect, this policy actually increased the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S.
“Yet, Mexicans nonetheless bore the brunt of the deportation campaign launched in the name of the war on terrorism, comprising 72 percent of those removed in 2009.”
“With the passage of the Patriot act in late 2001, the number of deportations increased again and reached nearly 400,000 in 2009. None of the terrorist attacks involved Mexicans, and none of the terrorists entered through Mexico...all came to the united States on legal visas.”
We’ve conflated the war on terror, the war on drugs, with immigration. This has led to mass deportations &amp; militarization at a time of record safety on the U.S. border. False fear is cynically stoked to harm those who pose no threat to this country. https://t.co/pyzVtfja6R
Our government built a border fence in El Paso in 2008, a misguided response to 9/11 (no terrorists have crossed the southern border and attacked this country). It didn’t make us any safer. In fact crime in El Paso increased after it was built.  https://t.co/JtP6ZxEoIE

It’s the same power that will ensure we help — instead of turn our backs on — asylum seekers. Will force us to meet the humanitarian challenge in Central America not with walls but with moral courage, an understanding of our ability to be there for those who have no other hope.
The same power we saw from those who showed up on Father’s Day in Tornillo last year — who formed the political pressure to force this administration to end family separation, to stop this country from taking kids from their parents at the border.
The last child has left Tornillo. It’s good for these kids and their families. And it shows the power of people who showed up for them and shared with the rest of the country that we were locking up immigrant kids for months at a time. You made this happen.

You can also volunteer directly through Annunciation House. They're looking for people who are willing to drive refugees to the bus station and airport. To get started, email refugees@annunciationhouse.org and a volunteer lead will get back to you.
Another way to help in El Paso: Organize a group that's willing to get to work preparing and bringing meals to various sites. Could be your school, church, neighborhood group. If you can make meals to feed groups of 50-100 refugees, please email refugees@annunciationhouse.org
While there isn't a need for donations of used clothing at this moment, Annunciation House is looking for NEW socks, underwear, and bras. Sizes small and medium for men, women, and children. They can be brought to the donation site (from 8am-8pm) at 1003 E San Antonio Ave.
If you're in the El Paso area, could use your help dropping off fresh fruit -- especially apples, oranges, tangerines, and bananas. They can be brought to the donation site at 1003 E San Antonio Ave.
@KayZed14 Churches in El Paso have opened their doors and they are providing some of shelter space.
I have also spoken with ICE, CBP, El Paso Office of Emergency Mgmt and incoming Congresswoman @vgescobar to see how we can better coordinate releases. My thanks to all those who are working on this.
Grateful to everyone who has donated so far — and to all of those on the ground here in El Paso who are helping with temporary shelter, food &amp; other help for these families. I will share volunteer opportunities in El Paso for those in the area as soon as they are shared with me.

There are 1,300 kids ready to leave to live with sponsors who have already been identified. But these children remain at Tornillo each day because this administration has deliberately prolonged the process of releasing them.

Let’s ensure that before we enter the next war, or renew the ones we're in, we understand as a country what victory looks like, what our strategy is to achieve it, and why we fight. I’ve had no greater honor in Congress than representing &amp; serving our veterans. Forever grateful.
Grateful to all who have served. More than ever, today you are in our thoughts as we celebrate your sacrifice and service. Let’s spare no expense as a country to ensure that you receive the care and services you’ve earned.

We need to expand Medicaid. If the moral reason isn't convincing enough, look at the financial one: our state is leaving $100 billion on the table by not expanding Medicaid. #TexasTownHall
11.5 million Texans under the age of 65 live with at least one pre-existing condition. That's half of Texans under the age of 65. We must safeguard protections for those with pre-existing conditions at a time when we're already the least insured state. #TexasTownHall

Cruz always puts himself and his career first. Only 2 Republicans worked with Democrats on legislation less often in 2017 than Cruz. And his career avg is even more partisan. From 1993-2016, only 1 senator of either party worked across the aisle less often. #TeamBeto #TexasDebate

Why did Ted Cruz vote to sell your private browsing history to the highest bidder without your consent? Follow the money. He took thousands from the telecom industry. He’s working for them not for us. #TeamBeto #TexasDebate
As a small business owner, Beto met a payroll each week and hired his fellow Texans in high-skill, high-wage jobs. As a city council member, he passed a balanced budget each and every year. #TeamBeto #TexasDebate
How could a supposed fiscal hawk like Ted Cruz vote to add two trillion dollars to the debt? Follow the money. He took nearly $120,000 from PACs who lobbied on, benefited from, or even helped write the tax bill. #TeamBeto #TexasDebate
This tax bill:	→Added $2 trillion to the debt	→Handed 80% of the benefits to top 1%	→Threatened the healthcare of one million Texans	→Was written by PACs, corporations, &amp; special interests	#TeamBeto #TexasDebate

Ted Cruz recklessly shut down the government of the United States for 16 days because he thought too many people were getting too much health care. #TeamBeto #TexasDebate
Texas is already the least insured state in the country. The last thing we need is for millions more to lose their ability to see a doctor. We have to defend protections for those with pre-existing conditions. Ted Cruz has refused to do so. #TeamBeto https://t.co/ZbS3TxH5mu
Senator Cruz is not going to be honest with Texas. #TexasDebate #TeamBeto https://t.co/030rpOG3n9
Texas is the least insured state in the country. Ted Cruz has done nothing in the last six years to improve this. Exactly the opposite -- he has voted to repeal more health care from more Texans. #TeamBeto #TexasDebate

"Coastal Bend refineries can play a role in reducing emissions that contribute to climate change. I want oil &amp; gas to come from this state. I don't think that is mutually exclusive to making sure we're generating our energy in a responsible way." #TeamBeto https://t.co/gmnMAD4eDz
✅Texas is number 1 in wind power 	✅Texas is soon to be number 1 in solar power	✅The fastest growing jobs today are in solar and wind	As a proud energy state, we should continue to lead the way. #TeamBeto #TexasDebate
When it comes to climate change, this can’t be about your career, your donors, your next election. It has to be about the next generation. We have the opportunity to do the right thing. #TexasDebate #TeamBeto https://t.co/4LNCLeumbx
Climate change is the defining existential threat of our time. Beto believes Texas should take the lead in confronting it head on. It’s how we’ll meet our responsibilities to those of future generations. #TeamBeto #TexasDebate
Climate change is real. Science is real. #TeamBeto #TexasDebate
The security of our elections is a paramount issue for our democracy. We need a United States Senator who will stand up and make sure our elections are free and fair. #TeamBeto #TexasDebate https://t.co/DCna8YGq42

Andrew Oldham refused to say whether Brown v. Board was correctly decided. Cruz stood by him. #TeamBeto	https://t.co/fFW2gOpL28
Texas needs a Senator who will only confirm qualified nominees to lifetime appointments. Jeff Mateer said transgender kids are part of Satan’s plan. Cruz stood by him. #TeamBeto	https://t.co/m4RJNQyabr
We need a Supreme Court justice who believes in voting rights, civil rights, women’s rights, workers’ rights, and equal rights. #TeamBeto #TexasDebate
Cambridge Analytica sent staff to Cruz campaign headquarters in Houston. The company ultimately did more than $5.8 million worth of work for his campaign. #TeamBeto #TexasDebate https://t.co/U2HoYMQ36d
In Helsinki, Trump defended our enemies instead of our country. The intelligence community is aligned yet Cruz is allowing the president to cozy up to dictators. #TeamBeto #TexasDebate
Inexplicably, Ted Cruz voted against $250 million in election security funding. We know that Russian operatives tried to hack the voting data of Americans. We need a senator who will stand up to the president when the people of this state are threatened. #TeamBeto #TexasDebate
Beto is running this race the right way -- no PACs, no corporations, no special interests. Just people in all 254 counties of this state. #TeamBeto
When the Senate took up debate on the future of immigration and Dreamers, Texas wasn't at the table. We need a senator who's going to support and represent all of us. https://t.co/YBhE3RmoiM

We're going to be there for our Texas teachers, our retired teachers, our public school classrooms across this state. https://t.co/PjwoOgDcLC
The border is incredibly important to the future of this country. It's important in the telling of the story of Texas. But it's not enough for me to say that. The only way to demonstrate that is to continue to show up. https://t.co/OiQmS54mfG
Beautiful morning in Laredo. On the road to Edinburg (12:30 at The Social Club) and Brownsville (6:00 at the Brownsville Event Center). See you soon! https://t.co/VImDkMTrge

Great company and a great conversation about the border on our drive from Del Rio to Eagle Pass. Thanks to @Castro4Congress, @JulianCastro, &amp; @poncho_nevarez for joining us on the road. https://t.co/SOhDIOsWZt
Amazing to be back with you in Laredo tonight! https://t.co/UhbLnxPapZ
We expanded access to mental health care for veterans. We did it by being a bridge over the pettiness, the partisanship, the dysfunction. We worked with everyone -- Republicans, independents, Democrats alike -- to get the job done. https://t.co/E9z4t6fD5t

Thinking of all those we met during our visit to Sonora and hope their community is doing okay after today's flash flooding. Texas is at the ready to help them recover.

RT @TexasTribune: “You know only one of us has been to each county in Texas and would have an idea of what Texas values and interests are.”…
Thank you, Texas! https://t.co/gihQJDB2hF
"We are running for this state, for this country, for each and every single one of us." Watch Beto's closing statement: https://t.co/jjB1DbtuLO
"At this deeply divided, highly polarized moment, you have reminded me that before we are Republicans or Democrats or independents, we are Texans. We’re Americans. We are human beings. And we’re going to start acting that way." #TeamBeto
"Only one of us has been to each county in Texas. Within months of being sworn to serve as your senator, Ted Cruz was not in Texas. He was in Iowa. He visited every single one of the 99 counties of that state." https://t.co/TXbaD6ca4s
With Beto, we’ll never have to wonder whether he’s voting for a PAC or for people. It’ll be people every single time. 	https://t.co/NcyNEo9Evk
Beto envisions a tax code where working families, small businesses, those in the middle class are rewarded for their hard work. Where everyone can get ahead.
As a small business owner, Beto met a payroll each week and hired his fellow Texans in high-skill, high-wage jobs. As a city council member, he passed a balanced budget each and every year.
$120,000. That’s how much money Cruz took in PAC contributions from organizations that lobbied on, benefited from, or even helped write the tax bill.
The tax bill was written in the margins by lobbyists who saw the legislation before Senators. 	https://t.co/UwMS54eqhJ
This tax bill:	→Added $2 trillion to the debt	→Handed 80% of the benefits to top 1%	→Threatened the healthcare of one million Texans	→Was written by PACs, corporations, &amp; special interests
254/254. https://t.co/eTk7v65quU
Beto is running this race the right way -- no PACs, no corporations, no special interests. Just people in all 254 counties of this state.
Beto believes we need universal, guaranteed, high-quality healthcare for every child, woman and man in this state, and every state in the nation. #TeamBeto https://t.co/C7meP1ZcKx
At a time when 20 veterans a day are taking their own lives, Beto worked with members of both parties to write and pass legislation that expands access to mental health care for our veterans. https://t.co/YaYSM1H7Fy
Beto introduced a proposal that would ensure every separating service member receives the mental health care they need. It passed Congress and President Trump signed it into law. 	https://t.co/82EyNsqm84
Cotton farmers, cattle ranchers, manufacturers across Texas are continuing to pay the price for these trade wars. 	https://t.co/4fPBdd1QOq
No state could be hit harder by these tariffs and trade wars. More than 2.6 million jobs are at risk.	https://t.co/9sw9L5w5Jh
Texas needs a senator who will work with the president when he can and stand up to him when he must. Putting our state, our country, our Democracy before party or the next election.
Texas is already the least insured state in the country. The last thing we need is for millions more to lose their ability to see a doctor. We have to defend protections for those with pre-existing conditions. https://t.co/ZbS3TxH5mu
https://t.co/amRoPsQbC5
11.5 million Texans under the age of 65 live with at least one pre-existing condition. That's half of Texans under the age of 65. We must safeguard protections for those with pre-existing conditions at a time when we're already the least insured state.
Here’s what would happen if we were to repeal every word of the ACA:	→Texas’ uninsured rate would spike	→We’d lose protections for pre-existing conditions	→We’d lose bans on lifetime caps and annual caps 	→We’d lose the ability of those up to age 26 to stay on a parent’s plan
Ted Cruz was one of the senators who voted to repeal healthcare without providing a replacement.
https://t.co/tHNgRmY9wP
It’s time to end the war on drugs. That starts by ending the federal prohibition on marijuana.
https://t.co/dtYSO6kQD3
"This movement calls for all of us, regardless of party or any other difference, to come together for this country that we love so much." https://t.co/BOV6cY2RP6
→In 2015, Cruz missed a quarter of votes. 	→In 2016, Cruz missed half of votes. 	Texas needs a full-time Senator.
Beto: "Thoughts and prayers, Senator Cruz, are just not going to cut it anymore."
Beto has a plan for gun safety:	✅End the online and gun show loopholes	✅Support federal research on gun violence	✅Pass universal background check legislation	✅Stop selling weapons of war into our communities 	✅Block the erosion of Texas’s license to carry standards
Beto believes this state can use our proud history of gun ownership, gun rights, gun safety, and gun responsibility as a place from which to lead the discussion in Congress.
Any nominee to a lifetime appointment must reflect the best interests of all of us. That means ruling for people and not corporations, people not special interests, people not the Super PACs who continue to purchase access and results.
We need a Supreme Court justice who believes in voting rights, civil rights, women’s rights, workers’ rights, and equal rights.
And Brett Talley had never even tried a case. 	https://t.co/oUnAtJ74ls
Andrew Oldham refused to say whether Brown v. Board was correctly decided. Cruz stood by him. https://t.co/fFW2gOpL28
Texas needs a Senator who will only confirm qualified nominees to lifetime appointments. Jeff Mateer said transgender kids are part of Satan’s plan. Cruz stood by him. 	https://t.co/m4RJNQyabr
Beto knows that at this moment, at this deeply divided highly polarized time in our history, this moment calls for all of us, regardless of party or any other difference of race or sexual orientation to come together.
What Beto said about the 200,000 Dreamers contributing to Texas communities: https://t.co/9bKMvLuGr1
Texans and Americans don't just stand up for their own rights but everyone's rights.
Every single American deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
We imprison more of our own people than any other country on the planet. We need to end mass incarceration. We need real, lasting, meaningful criminal justice reform.
Instead of wasting $30 billion on a wall, Beto worked with Senator Cornyn to introduce bipartisan legislation that would increase staffing along the border and help secure our ports of entry.  https://t.co/k3wKhhCZpN
Trump’s wall won’t be built in Mexico. It won’t be built in the Rio Grande. It’ll be built on Texan’s ranches, farms, private property. Beto wrote a bill to protect our land and prevent this from happening. 	https://t.co/6rAuCquzkS
Immigration is an issue that Texas should lead on. We are the defining border state, the defining immigrant experience. We should rewrite our laws to reflect our interests and values.
We need to free Dreamers -- 200,000 in Texas alone -- from the fear of deportation and make them U.S. citizens today.
Beto is the only candidate on tonight’s debate stage who has traveled to each one of the 254 counties of Texas.
Heading out to the debate stage and handing over my Twitter account to the team. Thanks for your support tonight! https://t.co/vVyXhXYtKT

And if we want to recruit the best into education, we have to treat our retired teachers like the public servants they are. That means putting an end to the Windfall Elimination Provision, increasing TRS resources, and securing more affordable health care.
That starts by paying our teachers a living wage, providing affordable health care, ensuring they have the resources needed to spark a lifelong love of learning, and empowering them to teach to their students -- not standardized tests.
Happening in 2018, in the wealthiest, the most powerful country. We've got to get our priorities straight and finally have the backs of our heroic public school teachers. https://t.co/TjO8zcCdgH

We're a full month into our road trip across Texas. Here's a recap from day 30: https://t.co/MVSeJSIiM6
Our American story is too big, too bold, too brave, too ambitious to allow the small, petty, divisive things to slow our progress towards a more perfect union. https://t.co/8W86KSQsxB
Thanks to everyone who joined us for an Austin town hall at the Mt. Sinai Baptist Church. If you couldn't make it, hope to see you tomorrow night for a 5:30 event at the Spider House. https://t.co/dKYyvcpWRd
Our thanks for the invite to speak at the Texas Disability Issues Forum in Austin this morning. Appreciate your guidance, advocacy, and leadership as we ensure every Texan has equal rights and is treated with dignity. https://t.co/dUjaDAob3C
Back in Austin and ready to continue working together so we can win this election for our state and this country. https://t.co/0fUO0vG9HU
Terminating NAFTA will have a real life, long lasting impact on farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, energy producers, small business owners in Texas. It generates $112 billion in exports for our state annually with 1 million jobs in our state connected to trade with Mexico alone. https://t.co/NsaqWeaxlG
After a bad accident on I-30 left us in standstill traffic for 90 minutes, we arrived to our Fort Worth rally late and after dark. But we were instantly met with an energy that could only come from Texas. Here's your day 29 recap: https://t.co/6IugsBBnKy
Sorry folks — still have not moved. Hope everyone is ok. PSA: don’t use the shoulder of the road — making it hard for ambulances and fire trucks to get by!! https://t.co/upxjQv8jNC
Looking forward to seeing you at Música con Beto at Americado! We are stuck in bumper to bumper traffic, bad accident on I-30. Will get there as soon as we can! https://t.co/NNHavipxoM

"An enthusiastic crowd of hundreds filled VFW Post No. 4006 in Navasota and spilled outside for Beto O'Rourke's town hall. O'Rourke has been steadily making his way across the state and has visited all 254 counties, taking questions from voters."	https://t.co/3GR3wDFeHG

Enjoyed being back in Huntsville for a town hall this afternoon. A lot of great questions especially from the students who helped organize the meeting. Now on the road to Dallas. https://t.co/hFAr8C8EE0
We should be accountable to and focused on teachers, retired educators, veterans, families, Texans. Not PACs, lobbyists, party bosses, or corporations. https://t.co/GHB3V1XME0
LIVE in Huntsville at Sam Houston State University for a town hall. Tune in on Facebook. https://t.co/H9hi9jhTpp
And we once again committed to one another that we will continue to run this race the right way. Without special interests, without corporations, without PACs. Just people. https://t.co/SWcXQcb2xw
Discussed how we work together to protect social security for all Americans. And ensure it is there for our kids and future generations. https://t.co/JLzIRG2eWi

No matter party or geography or any other small difference, all 28 million Texans are deserving of being listened to, being represented, being served, and being fought for. From smoothies with Arian Foster to a concert in Houston, here's a recap from day 26 on the road: https://t.co/FXY6aoVKMo
First in wind power and first in solar potential. With our proud history as an energy producing state, Texas continues to lead the way. https://t.co/lk3fEm2c8I
It's corporations or people. PACs or people. Special interests or people. Tonight in Houston, we made it clear that we are choosing people every single time. https://t.co/REMLb3taYg

Thursday afternoon town hall in Spring. Republicans, Democrats, independents alike coming together for our state and our country. https://t.co/Eho8Resecm
“Allowing a system to go on that offers lower earnings to half the population and meager sums to large swaths of Hispanic and African American women perpetuates poverty.” We need equal pay and a higher minimum wage so everyone has a shot at success.	https://t.co/Cs9ygelPXb
The 26th day of our drive across Texas started with an early morning town hall in Fort Bend County. Our thanks to everyone who joined us and asked questions. https://t.co/xafvUB1EtU

Visiting the Harris County jail today with Sheriff Gonzalez, I'm convinced that Texas can take the lead in criminal justice reform. https://t.co/jckR4n9dUT
"More than 200 people from across the region packed into the Hostess House at Hancock Springs in Lampasas. Collaboration across party lines and ideologies for the benefit of the nation was a reccurring theme in O’Rourke’s speech." https://t.co/9optOPIgLs
"Beto O'Rourke drew a large crowd in Beaumont. It's part of his 34-day drive across Texas. So far he's visited Beaumont seven times." https://t.co/q1RusIlFtj
"I don't do this. This is truly grassroots. I'm the grassroots. I'm here. I left my job at the Port Arthur Independent School District as an administrator to come and see you today. Don't disappoint me." From Houston &amp; Channelview to Beaumont &amp; beyond, we're doing this together. https://t.co/tHA4PVHxX0
No matter how close someone might be to the highest positions of power, they are not immune from accountability and justice in this country.
An update on family separation: there are at least 499 kids still separated from their families after we took them away. 20 children under the age of 5 continue to be separated from their parents too. This remains on all of us until we reunite them.
Back in Beaumont! Grateful to everyone who joined us on a rainy night for a town hall. https://t.co/3VE3ekPLWQ
By working together and moving beyond party, we were able to write, introduce, pass, and have signed into law a bill that expands mental health care access for veterans. https://t.co/X8OAkzuIk7
We have a maternal mortality crisis in this state and in this country. One where black women are more than twice as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women. 	https://t.co/Pjefy7xtHv
As soon as the final bell rang, these three heroic public school teachers ran across the street from Channelview HS to catch the last part of our town hall. One teaches engineering while the others teach English. Grateful for their service in the classroom &amp; that they'd join us. https://t.co/lvzRntTaEF
Just wrapped up our first town hall in Channelview. Enjoyed hearing your ideas, taking your questions, and learning more about the community. Looking forward to coming back. https://t.co/7XBG2CrZJO
Back in Beaumont tonight! Hope to see you at 5:30 in the IBEW 479 Hall (1430 Spindletop Ave) https://t.co/vgug91Yv9V

We're running this race the right way. Showing up everywhere, listening to everyone, and putting the people of Texas over political action committees every single day. https://t.co/4rSMPgwSy9
A great honor to speak with Rev. Bill Lawson. As a longtime civil rights champion, a good friend of Dr. King, &amp; the Pastor Emeritus of Wheeler Ave. Baptist Church, he reminds us of the progress achieved &amp; the work ahead to reach equal justice. In Houston, in TX, in this country. https://t.co/QEIwv2BwWK
About to go LIVE on @HoustonMatters. Tune in at 88.7 https://t.co/F60m9EwqMg

On day 23 of our road trip, we were talking about how students across Texas and throughout the country are not just the leaders of the future but the leaders of today. Take a look at what happened in Port Lavaca, Edna, and Houston. https://t.co/JOKLYi7bjT

Visited the Green Iguana a year ago in the hours after Harvey made landfall in Port Lavaca. They were cleaning up and working to help their neighbors do the same. A year later, they have repaired the damage and have tables full for lunch. Glad to see that they're doing well. https://t.co/YjRP2cLxSX
Back in Port Lavaca today for a great town hall at the VFW post. https://t.co/38Y0igVuna
Ben and George are both first time voters. Ben's mom, Tammy, gave them a ride from Conroe to Port Lavaca so they could attend our town hall. She also allowed them to paint this banner in the garage.

Learned a lot by being with so many courageous, strong, smart women who are leading the way in Houston. https://t.co/rriravuqkk

Dominoes in the fifth ward https://t.co/CwWrzaXerR
Grateful that Super	Neighborhood Presidents Keith Downey and Huey Wilson would spend their morning taking us around Kashmere Gardens. They estimate that half of the community is still displaced from Harvey. And of the 5 libraries destroyed, only one is back open. https://t.co/92OBlZPcqA
"O’Rourke campaigned with hundreds of people in Victoria on Thursday. The El Paso congressman discussed Victoria’s recovery from Hurricane Harvey, family separations at the U.S. border and other issues at a town hall at the Victoria Educational Gardens." https://t.co/mbbzeKVLua
Democrats, Republicans, independents, non-voters alike -- everyone coming together for our communities, our state, and our country. Here's a recap from day 12 on the road: https://t.co/6XVUVlTWp0
Closing out day 12 of our 34-day drive across Texas with a town hall in Katy. Texans have been showing up for our state and for everyone in our state every single day of this trip. https://t.co/yjx6EDBXgv
Coming together in Katy! https://t.co/U68o5jyKCo
Incredible energy this afternoon in Victoria! Great being back with you. https://t.co/1pY8F3wT5Q
To all those waiting at our town hall in Katy — we are in bumper to bumper traffic on I-10. Several accidents. I am doing my best to get there as soon as we can. https://t.co/xpOBsUafYd
Great group who joined us for a town hall outside on a beautiful day in Goliad. https://t.co/R58HUb0nzg
From Beeville to Corpus Christi, great discussions on the road across Texas. Today, we're in Rockport, Goliad, Victoria, and Katy. Here's a recap from day 11. https://t.co/11suWOvt92
Great being back with the people of Rockport this morning! Their strength, perseverance, and willingness to look out for one another is our example of the power of community. https://t.co/Je2OgD87YQ
Everywhere I go — smallest town, biggest city, very Republican, very Democrat — people in all 254 counties are asking about public education, and they’re sharing ideas for what we can do together to overcome the challenges our schools and teachers face. https://t.co/x8qlLCvVf4
Gillian's number one ask was for people to come spend time in Rockport again. To visit their beaches, go fishing, stay at their bed and breakfasts, eat at their restaurants, and see the beauty of the region. https://t.co/zwGBCtMhMV
Visiting w/ the Rockport Volunteer Fire Department who we spent time with nearly a year ago. Grateful that Gillian &amp; Stanley would take their morning to update us on the community's recovery.

I met Manuel when he evacuated from Corpus Christi during Harvey. He and his 3 cats took a bus to San Antonio where that city welcomed him with open arms at shelter. I got to see Manuel today in Beeville where he joined us for our town hall. He’s doing great and so are the cats. https://t.co/gcRacmHtUd

Veterans deserve accountability and transparency in how decisions at the VA are being made. Decisions that will impact the care and resources they've earned. https://t.co/q5JgxxVPVD
Alexandria, age 11, came to our town hall in San Antonio yesterday and told us that she has been going door to door with her parents to canvass for our campaign! https://t.co/fLPCzSRTKb
We're 10 days in to our 34-day drive across Texas! Yesterday, we were in San Antonio for a veterans forum, an immigration roundtable, and a town hall about public education. https://t.co/C8qIL6RxE7
@Tim_Walz Tim we had a veterans town hall today in San Antonio and was thinking about you and our colleagues who have helped to make HVAC an example of successful bipartisanship, focusing on suicide reduction, access to care, housing and expediting appeals. Proud to serve with you!
Teachers, principals, counselors, nurses, librarians, staff, retired educators, parents, students, and future instructors all coming together tonight for a discussion on our schools. Grateful for your service in and out of the classroom! https://t.co/yayALu6VkA

Today's veterans town hall focused on how we can make sure we're doing everything possible to serve those who served our country. Appreciate all the veterans and their family members who joined us. https://t.co/mlJInmttl8
Yesterday, we were walking door-to-door in San Antonio so we could meet, listen to, and learn from our fellow Texans. Here's a recap from day nine of our 34-day drive across the state: https://t.co/aSlijZ9f0f
Or when we have a nominee for a lifetime appointment on the Supreme Court who has weakened voting rights. We must use today's anniversary as a reminder of what John Lewis said while marching in Selma, "We’re not going back. We’re going to move forward."
The work is far from over when we still have racial gerrymandering, people being purged from the rolls, voter ID laws that are designed to make it more difficult for black voters to cast their ballots. When we have parts of the Voting Rights Act being invalidated piece by piece.
On this day 53 years ago, LBJ signed the Voting Rights Act into law. It happened because people were willing to march, to protest, to be arrested, to put their lives on the line crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge, to apply the pressure that formed the will to get it to his desk.
In response to Friday's attack ads, you just raised $1,274,528 over the weekend. No PACs, just people -- making 39,000 contributions at an average of $32. https://t.co/FTcP7ytwu3
From Kerrville and Johnson City to the honor of meeting civil rights icon Nettie Hinton​ at our town hall in San Antonio, the eighth day on the road was energizing, inspiring, and unforgettable. Here's a recap: https://t.co/JrFK6OcxYg
8 days, 20 events, 2,151.3 miles. https://t.co/Iy4R6XZuad
https://t.co/oe7idBoNK0
Back in Bexar! Our Eastside San Antonio town hall was an incredible way to close out week one of our road trip. https://t.co/3ft5RQlaiW
Grateful to everyone who came out on a hot Sunday afternoon for our Johnson City town hall. Met Jamie who just registered to vote last week. Proud of her, proud of you, proud of the campaign we're running together. https://t.co/EDmq7oiiHO

Really impressed by the questions and ideas from the women and men of the Texas Challenge Academy, a 5 1/2 month residential military academy in Iraan. Appreciate them joining us and lending a hand in setting up for our town hall meeting. https://t.co/8jnOkS03hf
Iraan might not be the biggest place in the state but it's a town full of hardworking Texans who have incredible drive, a pride in their community, &amp; smart ideas that will really shape our future. We discussed energy independence, healthcare, education and job training programs. https://t.co/UDev4HcjQv

Grateful that these Border Patrol agents were able to save one person from drowning. Quickly and courageously jumping into the current shows that the hard work of our agents and law enforcement officers across the southern border is like no other.	https://t.co/2C9gSQgDWk
Great being back in Lubbock today for our seventh visit. https://t.co/WKuHOn1LxU
We will not take a dime from any Political Action Committee (PAC) in this campaign. Proud that our Federal Election Commission (FEC) report shows $0.00 from PACs. Just people. https://t.co/m3ozdO3m3B

Ending day three of the road trip with a return to Amarillo! Grateful for those who spent their Tuesday night with us and for everyone who has always welcomed us to town. https://t.co/vtm3RaOCJ6
Our third town hall of the day brought us to the community of Muleshoe. A great conversation on healthcare and what we can accomplish together when we don't allow small difference to hold us back from moving this country forward. https://t.co/YQzeNQRhaV
Each visit, each town hall in Lubbock has been the example for coming together to share our questions, our ideas, our goals for this state and this country. Very very grateful. https://t.co/W8OAGj4T6E
Absolutely energized by our town hall in Lubbock! https://t.co/EyV2BsCHDZ
Started the day with a town hall in Seminole. Several of the questions focused on how we can be a check on the president's trade wars so these tariffs don't continue to hurt Texas' planters and growers. https://t.co/scaNrVomle
On the road to Lubbock! See you at the Cactus Theater for an 11:00 town hall. Everyone is welcome. https://t.co/sr8DL1ZV2j

Let's start by ending private prisons, mandatory minimums for minor drug offenses, the federal prohibition on marijuana, and the current system of cash bail that that punishes the poor.
To reduce the world's largest prison population, we must address the imbalances in our criminal justice system. That by age 14, 1 out of 4 African American children have experienced a parent being imprisoned.	https://t.co/aYaOY0y4W7
Congratulations to Paul Quinn College and President @michaelsorrell on their expansion. Already a longtime staple of the Dallas community, they'll bring leadership, power, and joy to Plano. 	https://t.co/CRkuIFHHrB
We need to make sure TRS pays a cost of living adjustment now rather than making retired teachers wait another decade. Then we must do away with the Windfall Elimination Provision that holds too many of them back. https://t.co/AFQfNLycBl
At least one congressional town hall every month in El Paso. Today, our 9⃣7⃣th. Always a chance to listen, learn, share progress, improve as a representative. To show democracy at its best. https://t.co/xijggR0ye3
An update: One of the mothers we met with at the El Paso ICE detention center has been released, and flew to Tennessee where she is being reunited with her 3 children. 700+ left to be reunited. It's happening one at a time but it doesn't happen unless we keep the pressure on.
Great news for Emilio and his son Oscar. My thanks to everyone on the ground in El Paso who kept the pressure on, making sure we did not send a journalist back to a country that has threatened his life for his reporting. https://t.co/8rXANgN7mD
Important editorial from the Longview News-Journal:	"Dreamers in TX have led to about 5,800 manufacturing jobs, Dreamers are expected to pay almost $250 million in state taxes during 2018. Some 1,000 Texas Dreamers are employed as first responders"	https://t.co/zCtZO65hJO
Grateful for the leadership of veterans across Texas who are holding Congress accountable and keeping the pressure on. We must work to urgently care for those who have been exposed to burn pits and to stop this from happening going forward. https://t.co/WweRvzPM02
All at a time when we have more student loan debt than credit card debt in this country.
1) Career Education Corporation reaches a $10 million settlement over defrauding students.		2) DeVos names 2 of their former executives as her senior counsel and senior adviser at our department of education.		3) The department changes guidance, puts corporations over students.
Even in situations where students have intentionally been defrauded. 	https://t.co/MIvXdfyxCF
Our senator was the deciding vote to confirm Betsy DeVos. Now she's siding with corporations and big money over students. https://t.co/b3yKGQu4M4
Thanks to Emma for getting us back to El Paso safely and for saying hello! https://t.co/OQel2IUiba
Just learned that a child is finally being reunited with their parent tonight in El Paso after spending 31 days apart. But more than 700 kids continue to remain separated from their parents. https://t.co/V1AQINgyZl
More than 50,000 women are severely injured giving birth each year. About 700 mothers die. Half of these deaths could be prevented and half the injuries reduced or eliminated with better care.
Our country remains the most dangerous place in the developed world to give birth. Twice as deadly for black women. https://t.co/yM1u53fN5d
Deadline just passed. More than 1 in 3 children who were taken from their parents remain separated. Our office is tracking 115 cases in El Paso alone. No clear indication when or if they will be reunited. 	https://t.co/SjXDO9AH3G
We can't take this progress or the ADA's promise to guarantee equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for granted. https://t.co/y8eiCqGWmE
28 years later, the ADA has helped get us closer to equal justice. Ensuring everyone can live to their full potential requires next steps, from protecting the ADA &amp; passing the Disability Integration Act to creating greater access to the workforce for those with disabilities.
"The ad, titled "Showing Up," takes audio and images from O'Rourke's visits to Texas counties, including clips from the live Facebook videos that have become synonymous with his campaign." https://t.co/8KhIkyFE9u
Just launched our first ad. Entitled "Showing Up," it's filmed using an iPhone and was created entirely with live stream footage from our travels to all 254 counties of Texas. Watch and RT to share. https://t.co/INmmjlXX4Y
We've met with farmers and ranchers, growers and planters, automakers and energy producers. They want access to the international market, to trading opportunities and global partners, all of which are being blocked by the president's tariffs and trade war. https://t.co/LkLsLLZAOQ
If you're able to see a doctor and manage your healthcare, you're more likely to be able to go to work and live to your full potential. https://t.co/NzNCzdew9x
That pregnant black women are dying at 2X the rate of pregnant white women. That black kids in preK-2nd grade were 5X more likely than white kids to receive a suspension. For K-12, 4X more likely. That by age 14, 1 out of 4 black kids have experienced a parent being imprisoned.
James Baldwin once wrote "Not everything that is faced can be changed. But nothing can be changed until it's faced." Let's face head-on that unemployment is 2X higher for blacks than whites in TX. That white families have 10X more wealth than black families in America.
Important editorial from the Dallas Morning News: "As a state and a nation, we must do better. Yes, racial profiling and institutional bias still play major roles in holding back black men from economic success, if not survival." https://t.co/GAlLv8ekXo
This is America right now. And it's up to every single one of us to change that. https://t.co/b6IUjInHUM
We all want newly confirmed VA Sec. Robert Wilkie to be successful. His success means we are better able to serve the women and men who served our country. I'm ready to work with him to reduce veteran suicide, enhance accountability, and deliver the care our veterans have earned.
As of 10 days ago, shelters in Texas alone housed 5,024 children. https://t.co/OMhXTnWQP5
This calls for an extended public comment period where everyone can be heard, where environmental studies can be completed, where the communities on the ground can participate. https://t.co/N8NaTB5p4w
Had the opportunity to meet with members of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority on Thursday. Proud of their work to donate 300 novels and textbooks to Paul Quinn College.	https://t.co/1w4LOXHVAe
More than 200,000 Dreamers in Texas. They contribute to the success of our communities, state, and country. https://t.co/2Fk5FNqv9l
There is a shortage of beds for patients with mental health needs in our state. The lack of beds means Texans keep revolving through the criminal justice system as many get arrested on purpose to try and receive care. https://t.co/VXWNgsJBi0
At a time when the gap between the very rich and everyone else is larger than any point since the 1920s, we have to pick a side between people and corporations. I pick people. https://t.co/sOVnoh92MU
Ayer visitamos Annunciation House para escuchar a familias que finalmente han sido reunidas. https://t.co/j79VWIssFK
Texas should be the state that leads the way in getting behind our public school teachers and making sure TRS finally pays a cost of living adjustment. https://t.co/j31HhnXlBC
Want to help families who’ve just been reunited? Annunciation House is one of just 4 shelters nationally that is able to take in these families. You can ensure that they have the resources for food, clothes, medicine by donating here: https://t.co/R3GY0TrMOr
Seeing kids who’ve just been reunited w parents but who are seemingly numb, not bonding, not connecting with their moms and dads. Clear that this has caused deep trauma for them. Grateful to the social workers, therapists and volunteers on site who are doing their best to help.
Clear that there is still not a firm plan in place for reunification. I get the sense local ICE office doing its best but in no way prepared for this level of industrial scale separation. No clear consistent means to track parents &amp; kids once separated.
Just met w ICE officials to see how we can speed reunification. Also met w 3 mothers in detention who still don’t know when or if they will see their kids again. We are putting people through a lot of unnecessary pain &amp; anguish. Must end family separation &amp; reunite every family. https://t.co/mRSkVRTECS
Just met with families who were reunited today including one mother who was seeing her daughter for the first time in 53 days. Reality is that too many children are still separated from their families. Heading to ICE to speak with parents who are still waiting to be reunited. https://t.co/V5u1fFB6OG
Any school finance reform must include increasing funding for low income and underserved communities so we can work towards achieving equity in our classrooms. https://t.co/NhUS6ctvRc
The teacher shortage comes at a time when we're seriously considering deporting an estimated 20,000 of them, many bilingual, who are in the DACA program. 2,000 in Texas alone. https://t.co/LeiSOjTRCf
"The poor are still poor because, despite their material goods, they still lack public dignity and control over the most important facts of their lives, such as where they live and how their children are educated...the War on Poverty is far from over." https://t.co/FPNK0IN4Hr
This is connected to climate change, which is connected to the personal and political decisions we make. https://t.co/A2q1lf0hnO
Ensuring our fellow Texans can be insured isn't just good for them, it's great for all of us as more people in our communities are able to see a doctor and get the care they need. This 86% cut isn't good for anyone. https://t.co/EaqZR2rjy5
The last few days have only made the case for coming together stronger, the need for putting our state and our country over anything that might otherwise divide us more urgent. Grateful that you'd join us. https://t.co/FcBDHX4OyN
Incredible being back with you in Dallas last night! https://t.co/DuBFy2YVB6
Hope to see you in Dallas this evening at 6:30! https://t.co/NgfsCcUnPt
Can’t say whether he agrees w the landmark school desegregation decision Brown vs Board — but Senate just confirmed him anyhow.  By one vote. Need a TX senator who will vote against nominees who threaten civil rights, voting rights and a woman’s right. 		https://t.co/fFW2gOpL28
The press is not the enemy of the people.
Just days after the Justice department issued indictments for 12 Russian agents, agents who sought to undermine the genius of America — that 242 years in we are still able to govern ourselves and freely choose our leaders — the President chose a foreign power over the U.S.
On foreign soil, standing next to the leader of a country that threatens our own, the President refused to stand up for America and instead chose to side with Russia and its dictator, Vladimir Putin. https://t.co/Fu4uXzty2y
We've got to get big money out of our politics. This does the opposite, giving more power to special interests and corporations at the expense of people and our democracy. 	https://t.co/aoTubhesW7
The fact that the wealthiest, most powerful country in the world is abandoning our asylum laws. That our current immigration laws -- built on fear and cemented by characterizing immigrants as criminals, rapists, animals, an infestation -- don't reflect the reality on the ground.
That we can make our immigration laws and enforcement more humane. We should start by using the House, the world's most deliberative body, to talk about real crises facing our country. The fact that more than 2,500 kids remain separated from their parents after we took them away.
I don’t support the abolishment of ICE, but it’s wrong to pass leg that praises some of the practices that need reform. Those of us who call the border home, including ICE officers &amp; border patrol agents who live in our communities, know we can do better than current policies.
Voted on a cynical bill to give a blanket endorsement to the practices of ICE. While doing nothing to reunite kids w/ parents or address legitimate concerns about practices within ICE, it did condone militarization of the border &amp; the admin’s zero tolerance policies. I voted NO.
The urgent concerns we're hearing across all 254 counties of Texas are too critical to abandon civility, decency, and bipartisanship for anything that could otherwise divide us. https://t.co/R9FP4wtHye
More than 11.5 million Texans under the age of 65 live with at least one pre-existing condition. We can't let them lose care at a time when we're already the least insured state in the country. https://t.co/m8r6XhyvzO
Farmers in Texas — many already struggling to pay the note, afford healthcare, make ends meet — are getting slammed by Trump’s tariffs https://t.co/4fPBdd1QOq
Accounting for more than $8.3 billion in steel and aluminum imports last year (twice as much as any other state!), Texas has borne the brunt of Trump's tariffs. https://t.co/xLgL1PRWbc
These trade wars and tariffs have a real life impact on Texans. Prices for washing machines, refrigerators, oven ranges, and barbecues are all spiking. Our agricultural, auto, and energy industries hit hard too. https://t.co/gppNToTyKF
"The solution to the problem Trump created starts with treating people like they're people, not like animals, as he called them recently. Start with that, and the solution to what looks now like an unsolvable problem will follow." -Corpus Christi Caller Times
"This is a human rights emergency of Trump's creation. Not only did he and his lieutenants choose separation of parents from children as a deliberately cruel cudgel...but they did it with no discernible plan for reuniting the children with their families."
"Our gov has 2,600 children to reunite with their parents. 2 heart-warming stories about reunification shouldn't leave the impression that our gov is on top of this crisis, or that any credit is due. We don't thank arsonists for putting out their fires." https://t.co/6mxdrUkqiv

Honored to share this year's Prize for Civility in Public Life with my colleague Rep. Will Hurd at a time when our country needs decency and bipartisanship more than ever. When the stakes couldn't be any higher. When everything we care about is on the line. https://t.co/2otKL5JbST
We need to expand Medicaid to cover more Texans including vulnerable children and the disabled. But we must also fight with everything we've got to keep protections for those with pre-existing conditions in place &amp; not allow a reversal of the ACA's end to lifetime &amp; annual caps.
Many families register on first-come, first-served lists for aid, equipment, home care and other services. But these lists can stretch more than 10 years. And because Texas declined to expand Medicaid, some lists stretch to thousands of names.
Working families with disabled children can get help from the Medicaid buy-in program, but they can't qualify for it if they earn more than 150% of the fed. poverty level ($36,450 for a family of 4 in TX). This leaves those who most need care without it. https://t.co/ri2WZ7ZEej

Texas should expand Medicaid so more people can see a doctor and be well. But there's also a significant economic benefit. The 32 states that expanded Medicaid have realized budget savings, revenue gains, and overall economic growth. https://t.co/V5R8297rDH
We all have to pick a side. I pick people. That’s why we’re not taking a dime from PACs or corporations. That’s why we’re showing up everywhere, all 254 counties, listening to and standing up for everyone. All people, all the time.
It’s pharmaceutical corporations vs. people (high prices &amp; no accountability). Private prison corporations vs people (mandatory minimums). Internet service corporations vs people (ending net neutrality). Baby formula corporations vs people (UN resolution on breastfeeding).
Those who are politically connected (corporations like Purdue) are protected from accountability and people suffer as a result. They buy influence and outcomes through lobbying, PAC contributions and sympathetic political appointees.
Meanwhile street levels dealers go to prison. If low level offenders (disproportionately black) are going to prison so should the corporate executives who created the problem in the first place.
Purdue pharma markets OxyContin (highly addictive narcotic) as less prone to addiction, lies to Congress, &amp; continues to create crisis in addiction and death. Those responsible for opioid crisis (how many deaths?) let off w slap on the wrist. https://t.co/HgLDnrkd4Y

A reminder that the press is not the enemy of the people but the best defense against tyranny. A reminder that thousands of children are still separated from their parents after being taken in our name. And a reminder that we must keep up the pressure until families are reunited.
Vivid stories are emerging about the Trump administration's family separation policy. And many of the stories being told are inconsistent with what the government has been saying about the thousands of children who were taken from parents. https://t.co/drGYZWZaGJ

We must meet these challenges with urgency, strength, and determination. We must not become complacent. As President Johnson said on this date in 1964, "My fellow citizens, we have come now to a time of testing. We must not fail."
The march continues at a time when disparities remain in homeownership, employment, and access to capital. When white families have 10 times more wealth than black families. When the unemployment rate is 2X higher for blacks than whites in Texas.
The march continues at a time when a child’s ZIP code still determines their academic future. When we have a school-to-prison pipeline that leaves black students nearly 4X as likely to be suspended. A graduation rate that finds white students far more likely to receive a diploma.
The march continues at a time when our state implements laws that knowingly make it more difficult for African-American and Latino voters to cast their ballots. When gerrymandering intentionally draws people out of their democracy based on their race and ethnicity.
But 54 years later, we know the Civil Rights Act is not yet fully realized. We know that disparities remain in access to the ballot, access to high-quality public education, access to higher education, access to capital and high-wage jobs, access to equality in our communities.
"It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual...because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin"
"Desegregation means the assignment of students to public schools and within such schools without regard to their race, color, religion, or national origin"
"The Commission shall investigate allegations in writing under oath or affirmation that certain citizens of the United States are being deprived of their right to vote and have that vote counted by reason of their color, race, religion, or national origin"
"All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities and privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion or national origin."
"in public facilities and public education, to extend the Commission on Civil Rights, to prevent discrimination in federally assisted programs, to establish a Commission on Equal Employment Opportunity"
The law was intended, "to enforce the constitutional right to vote, to confer jurisdiction upon the district courts of the US to provide injunctive relief against discrimination in public accommodations, to authorize the AG to institute suits to protect constitutional rights"
Signing the legislation, President Johnson said, "This Civil Rights Act is a challenge to all of us to go to work in our communities and our States, in our homes and in our hearts, to eliminate the last vestiges of injustice in our beloved country."
The Civil Rights Act was signed into law 54 years ago. It was the people -- marching, sitting at lunch counters, being sprayed with fire hoses, bitten by dogs, shedding the blood -- who applied the pressure that formed the political will to force this onto the president's desk.
What's not exaggerated is the reality that this admin wants to use eminent domain to take land for a 2,000 mile, $30 billion wall when 2/3 of the land it will be built on isn't owned by the fed gov. It's ranches, businesses, habitats, private property.	https://t.co/c2ghxMR5ON

The number of adults apprehended with children so far during FY 2018 is actually 15% lower than the number of adults arrested with children during the same period in FY 2017. The number of unaccompanied children arrested is also down from last year.
We must urgently address imbalances in our criminal justice system. Start by ending mandatory minimums for minor drug offenses, ending the fed. prohibition on marijuana, ending cash bail, stopping the use of private prisons, and providing an environment that welcomes re-entry.
We know that our criminal justice system has created a cycle that puts a disproportionate amount of people of color in jail. African Americans and whites use drugs at similar rates, but the imprisonment rate of African Americans for drug charges is almost 6 times that of whites.
Our country incarcerates a larger proportion of its citizens than any other nation, most of whom are black or brown. African Americans are incarcerated at more than 5 times the rate of whites. https://t.co/iECQmru7n7

In the last week alone, the Supreme Court has issued close rulings on the president's Muslim ban, on workers’ rights, on voting rights, on gerrymandering, and on a woman’s right to choose. The stakes for this nomination couldn't be higher. We have to get this right.
It means a new justice who will safeguard the rights of the LGBTQ community. Finally get big money out of politics. End gerrymandering. And ensure every single person coming before that highest court is treated with respect and dignity.
This means defending and expanding civil rights, voting rights, and workers' rights. It means protecting a woman's right to choose. And upholding protections for those with pre-existing conditions who can finally see a doctor and get the care they need.
Justice Kennedy's retirement opens up a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. Any nomination to that seat must live up to the words written above the steps of the highest court in the land, "equal justice under law."

We shouldn't be a people who ban individuals of one religion from the shores of a country comprised of immigrants the world over. We are a people who mobilize &amp; show up in airports to confront such a ban. We will continue this fight to define our country. We will get this right.
We must end gerrymandering where members of Congress choose their voters instead of the other way around. We should have a non-partisan, non-politician redistricting commission that ends the practice of racial gerrymandering that has drawn people out of their democracy.
We must work towards access to jobs that pay above a living wage, skill training programs, high-quality public schools for ALL kids no matter ZIP code, affordable housing, &amp; the ability to see a doctor by expanding Medicaid in TX &amp; achieving universal, guaranteed health care.
Compared to 46% of whites, only 45% of Hispanics and 25% of black men and black women escaped poverty. Taking action to end poverty and ensure every Texan can live to their full potential is not just good for that person but it's great for our state. https://t.co/yDNIAtKWc0

There's a new policy now on the part of our government for ORR to share information with ICE. This is likely to be causing a chilling effect on the government’s ability to release children who are being held in camps to their relatives living in the US. 	https://t.co/0SRrkqypFe
https://t.co/Zv2YaOppYB
This agreement bw ICE and HHS “represents a dramatic change from past practice—replacing the best interests of children with the operational expediency of immigration enforcement.”		https://t.co/uyYcUoZoYe
HHS unable to answer: if total number of families apprehended is down over last year; if total number of unaccompanied kids is up only 4%, then why are we keeping kids longer? Avg stay in detention for kids has gone from 34 days to 56 days. Many kids staying longer than that.
I met 7 girls who had just arrived at Tornillo this morning. They’ve been in detention for weeks at other locations. Made the journey on their own, hoping to join family here in the U.S.
What HHS/ORR could not tell me is why they share info about the sponsors (family in the U.S.) for these kids with ICE — the agency tasked with deporting undocumented migrants. Before a kid is placed they get immigration status on everyone in the sponsor’s household.
I met officials from HHS &amp; contractor who built Tornillo tent city (BCFS) for these kids. They agreed that this crisis was imposed by the Trump administration - that the tent camps at Tornillo would never have been built had Trump not taken kids from their parents at the border.
I met children who had been in detention for over 3 months; kids whose parents had already been deported back to Guatemala; kids who had no idea when or if they’d see their parents again.
I was able to visit the children being held in Tornillo. While I am grateful to those who are caring for these kids, the bottom line is that taking kids from their parents and failing to reunite them afterwards is cruel and inhumane. Now we need to make sure it’s un-American.

While 99% of participants attended their ICE check-ins and appointments, a full 100% attended their court hearings. That's according to DHS' Office of Inspector General.
The family case management program only cost $36 a day per family compared to $319 per person indefinitely kept in detention.
Instead of indefinitely keeping families in cages and camps, the family case management program offered a different, more humane path: requiring asylum seekers to check in for their appointments. 99% of participants successfully attended their court appearances and ICE check-ins.
There are currently private prisons and private immigrant detention centers that have established massive political action committees (PACs). We should end all three.
The United States of America separated more than 2,000 children from their parents. This country can and must reunite those families. https://t.co/B4pd0EOX41
Looking at this executive order, how does it reunite kids with their parents?
We marched, called, stood up and spoke out because we believed America to be a place that doesn't take kids from their moms and dads. But we also believe America to be a place that doesn't indefinitely detain families &amp; children in camps. If we don't continue to act, it will be.
Let's immediately reunite separated families. But let's also refuse to be a nation that indefinitely locks away these families in cages for doing what any of us would do for our own children. For seeking refuge in a country comprised of immigrants &amp; asylum seekers the world over.

Late last night, the House voted to cut $7 billion from the Children's Health Insurance Program. The theory was that this would reduce "wasteful" &amp; "unnecessary" spending. The ability for 400,000 Texas kids to see a doctor is not a waste and it is certainly necessary. Voted no.

@heidirosie You're 100% right. And for Black women in Texas, the rate is double. It's unconscionable.
Pregnancy is considered a pre-existing condition. So prior to the Affordable Care Act's provision protecting those with pre-existing conditions, women were frequently denied health care coverage because of it. Let's not go back.
TX has the highest uninsured rate in the nation. Declined Medicaid expansion. Now taking aim at protections for those with pre-existing conditions. Texans need to be able to see a doctor &amp; receive care. But millions more would lose their ability to do so. https://t.co/2Crg2dqVyI
Those who put their boats into the water during Harvey weren't doing so to catch a view of the storm. They were heroes saving the lives of strangers. Like Alonso Guillen, a Dreamer from Lufkin who died while rescuing his fellow Texans from the flooding. https://t.co/wih3H2JrIN
Our veterans don't stop serving when they return home. Grateful for the advocacy &amp; leadership of the veterans who testified yesterday. We must act urgently to care for those who have been exposed to burn pits &amp; to stop this from happening going forward. https://t.co/rUvIpeUUo7
The number of Texans finally receiving care thanks to this provision includes more than 780,000 people in Harris, 455,000 people in Dallas, 386,000 people in Parker &amp; Tarrant, and 321,000 people in Bexar. Big reason why we've seen our uninsured rate drop since the ACA was passed.
Important read. The Affordable Care Act's provision protecting those with pre-existing conditions is under attack. Few states would be hurt more than ours. 11 million Texans below the age of 65 have at least one pre-existing condition. That's half of us. https://t.co/7qThoBLs0t

In the memory of James Byrd Jr., in the memory of Matthew Shepard, in the memory of those killed in hate crimes before and after their time, we must continue the march for civil rights, equal rights, and a more just America where we are all treated with dignity and respect.
For it's never enlightened members of Congress or presidents who've gotten the hard things done. It's the people who've applied the pressure that has formed the political will to force them to get the right thing done. We see that in every civil rights fight of our history.
My colleague John Lewis reminds us of something Dr King used to say: there is nothing more powerful than the rhythm of marching feet. For James &amp; Matthew, advocates marched on, accepting they might fail at first but knowing their incremental progress would eventually cause change
So in 2009 with a new president, they tried again. Though opposed by some Texas reps, it passed the House. It went to the Senate. Newly appointed AG Eric Holder testified in favor. With 5 members crossing the aisle, it passed. On Oct 28, President Barack Obama signed it into law.
It failed in 2001, 2004, 2005. In 2007, it passed the House but failed in the Senate. When it finally passed the Senate, it received a veto threat from the president and eventually failed again. But advocates across the country refused to give up. Continued marching for progress.
To remember Byrd and address what had occurred, there were efforts to pass the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. For years, it faced sharp opposition in Congress including from Texas reps, senators, and our current Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
James Byrd Jr. was brutally murdered in a hate crime 20 years ago today. Chained to the back of a truck and dragged for miles through Jasper, Texas, he was killed because of the color of his skin. This is what happened in the years that followed [1/7]	https://t.co/guuswHsYy8

"Veterans suffer chronic severe pain at rates disproportionately higher than their civilian counterparts (roughly 40% higher according to the National Institutes of Health), helping to explain why the opioid crisis has hit veterans at a rate two times the national average."
"Never mind that medical cannabis is now legal in 30 states, or that its medicinal value is recognized by health experts such as the American College of Physicians, the American Public Health Assoc, &amp; the American Nurses Assoc as a safer alternative to many legal treatments."
"While VA physicians are quick to prescribe powerful drug cocktails (opiates &amp; benzodiazepines) in response to service-related conditions, the federal government continues to deny veterans legal access to a demonstrably safer alternative treatment option — medical cannabis."
We've got to allow doctors to prescribe what's in the best interests of our veterans, including cannabis. The research is clear: we need to stop denying legal access to something that will significantly ease the pain many of our veterans are living with.	https://t.co/LkkwUzznra

A story of renewal that we've seen across TX as we've driven to nearly every county. Places like Goldthwaite where we held a town hall in a restaurant newly opened by immigrants from Jalisco. Their entrepreneurship was injecting new life into the community	https://t.co/Zr6tU9Wt0N
A reminder that instead of allowing profits and corporations to control decision making and care, we need to achieve guaranteed universal healthcare for every single one of us. So that no person is priced out. And so we are all well enough to contribute to our full potential.
In these stories &amp; the many more that still need to be uncovered, the heroes are the patients, the parents, the families, &amp; the caregivers who never give up. Who give a voice to the voiceless &amp; fight with everything they've got to be treated with the dignity we all deserve.
In Kosse, Marta looked for a psychiatrist for her 12-year-old foster son whose previous provider had retired. Off his medication for weeks, the boy threatened a sibling with a knife and had a mental breakdown at school. Needed to see a doctor but the wait was 6 months.
Part 3: The companies TX hires &amp; pays billions to care for its sickest citizens have been overstating the number of doctors &amp; specialists available to treat them. DMN called every doctor asking if they could schedule a new-patient appointment for a foster child. Only 9% could.
In San Antonio, Heather was nearly completely paralyzed. She found joy in being visited by nurses. But then the company TX paid to manage her care cut the hours of her nurses. She was alone for 17 hours a day, unable to move, and in pain. All to save the company a few bucks.
Part 2: Texas used to pay for long-term nursing home care directly, writing checks to doctors &amp; home-care agencies. But now our state turns over many of its health programs to private companies, allowing corporations to profit as they skimp on essential care for disabled adults.
But the company received no sanctions or fines. In fact, Texas handed them tens of thousands more medically fragile kids to care for in 2017. They received a brand new contract worth more than $440 million a year.
In Mesquite, D’ashon was born 3 months early, unable to breathe on his own. But with proper care, he was doing better. Then a health care company decided he didn’t need round-the-clock nursing care. The decision would save them as much as $500/day. It cost D’ashon everything.
Part 1: TX pays companies billions to arrange care for foster children, disabled children, chronically sick children. Every $ they don’t spend on care can be used to pay millions in executive bonuses. TX knows companies are skimping on care to make profits but failed to stop it.

We need a senator who is not afraid to raise these issues with the president. Someone who will stand up to him when he is going to hurt Texas jobs and economic growth. Who will be a voice for the 28 million of us who call Texas home. That’s what I want to do.
It comes down to the fact that TX is among the nation’s most active states for trade. We rank first in exports. $97 billion in exports to Mexico alone. Our communities depend on it -- from agricultural centers to Houston where exports account for nearly one-fifth of the economy.
In particular, these tariffs and trade wars threaten our small and medium-sized businesses, which make up more than 90% of all Texas exporters. Their customers abroad support more than 3 million jobs across Texas.
Or talk about how the Pecan Capital of the World is right here in Texas. And that our state is the second largest producer of pecans nationwide. Tariffs hitting pecan growers in San Saba and grapefruit growers in the Rio Grande Valley don’t help our state either.
Could explain what sorghum is. That Texas produces more of it than any other state besides Kansas. That China accounts for more than 70% of US sorghum exports and our share of exported sorghum is 25% of the country’s, accounting for $209 million annually.
Those in the Lubbock region know this better than anyone: our share of US-produced cotton actually makes up nearly half of exports to China, valuing $450M annually. It’s our state’s number two commodity behind beef cattle.
Could talk about agriculture. How Texas is a top producer of cotton, wheat, corn, beef, sorghum -- all of which are targeted by tariffs. One Texan said, “you couldn’t have picked a list of commodities that were more representative of our growers.”
Could point out that Texas imports more steel and aluminum than any other state in the U.S. That we rely upon those metals for a booming energy sector. That these new tariffs will cause layoffs.
You could start with the fact that Texas is home to the San Antonio-based Toyota manufacturing plant and the company’s new North America HQ in Plano. No automaker will be hit harder by these tariffs. Prices of cars will have to go up.
Texas could be hit harder than any other state by these kinds of tariffs. Trump’s trade policies will devastate our state, businesses, &amp; economy. Senator Cruz should have explained that to the president while they were riding together last month.
As I said at our Midland town hall back in April, whether it's the energy we produce, the cotton we grow, the cattle we raise, all of this has a connection to the rest of the world. These trade wars are really bad for the Texas economy.	https://t.co/70izgiC53r

And no state is hurt more than ours. Texas continues to have the highest uninsured rate as our neighbors are unable to see a doctor &amp; get the care that they need. We must change course and move towards guaranteed universal healthcare coverage.
"This increase in the uninsured is as unnecessary as it is unsurprising. Under Trump, the ACA’s coverage mandate has been repealed, the window of time to sign up for coverage has been cut in half and promotion of the Affordable Care Act has been slashed." https://t.co/cwtbifktg2

The open dialogue we’ve been having across Texas is missing from Congress. The House and Senate owe this country a real discussion, debate, and vote on these issues. That's how it's supposed to work. I will continue to do my best to meet this crisis with the urgency it deserves.
Texans can use our proud history of gun ownership, gun rights, gun safety, and gun responsibility as a place from which to lead. We can sit down with any person of any party in any place and at any time to figure out how we can make sure that this does not continue to happen.
They're at the table. They don't have a shortage of ideas: universal background checks, stop the new sale of assault weapons &amp; high-capacity magazines, give federal help to school districts, fully support research on gun violence, improve record sharing, implement Red Flag Laws.
Any question, any hesitation on how to move forward has been answered by gun violence survivors, young people, high school students who are already leading us towards the difficult, important conversation that this country owes them, owes all of us.
Remembering that, we can meet silence with action. Tragedy with common purpose. The disagreements with compromise and consensus that allow us to do better — not perfect but better than what we have today. Shouldn’t be too much to ask for the kids who died in art class, should it?
There are 535 members of Congress. Each member responsible for representing the interests of this country, of people, of human beings, of kids. Not responsible for representing PACs or lobbies, corporations or special interests. Not responsible for focusing on the next election.
Either we accept this or we act. That’s it. That's the choice before us. 	https://t.co/fn3W5q70jk

The current Congress &amp; administration wont lower drug prices. The reason is “both simple and crude: Pharma has bought itself enough politicians to block policies that might reduce its profits.” That’s why I don’t take PAC money.  https://t.co/dmHaEbEXhb

@immoderator Definitely. When running for Congress in 2012, I pledged to host at least one town hall back in El Paso every single month where my constituents could share their ideas, ask questions, and hold me accountable. Just held our 94th. We'll do the same in the Senate.
2⃣ days, more than 8⃣0⃣0⃣ miles. 	An unforgettable weekend meeting Texans in:	🚘Killeen	🚘Temple	🚘Waco	🚘Eastland	🚘Abilene	🚘Paducah	🚘Wellington	🚘Wheeler	🚘Borger	🚘Dumas	🚘Amarillo	Thanks for sharing your ideas, perspectives, and energy with me.

We shouldn't be surprised that Texas  has one of the lowest levels of voter turnout in the nation if our state is violating voting laws. We are not a red state or a blue state, we are a nonvoting state and it's by design. https://t.co/eTp40xUUNA
Our state should expand Medicaid to cover more Texans. Our country should create a public option on the exchanges so Americans have access to affordable coverage. And we should achieve universal, guaranteed quality health care for each and every one of us.
Our state's uninsured rate, according to Gallup	2013: 27%	2016: 20% (⬇7⃣)	2017: 22% (⬆2⃣)	We already have the highest uninsured rate in the nation. 4.3 million Texans can’t see a doctor. Efforts to repeal the ACA are making it far worse. https://t.co/8CFPZJzZTy

Introducing term limits, outlawing Political Action Committees, ending Citizens United, and putting a stop to gerrymandering are essential to returning power to the people and finally having a government that is responsive to those it purports to serve &amp; represent.
Our legislation would amend the Constitution to cap service at 12 years. A maximum of six two-year terms in the House and two six-year terms in the Senate. We have term limits for most offices, from the presidency to the Mayor of El Paso. Let's have term limits for Congress too.
Just joined my colleagues in introducing bipartisan legislation to limit the number of years a member of Congress can serve. We must end the perpetual re-election of Reps and Senators, and start bringing new voices, ideas, and perspectives to the Capitol.
As we've traveled the state, it's been clear that public schools are the foundation of our communities. Often the largest employer too. Taking our tax dollars away from our classrooms &amp; turning them into vouchers will only cause more cuts for our schools. https://t.co/6BnOxBTYDM

Let's bring this bipartisan legislation to the floor, significantly ease the pain many of our veterans are living with, and simultaneously address the over-prescription of opioids. https://t.co/BPDWZQBYAe
At another town hall, a veteran came forward &amp; said that without an alternative to the opioids he was previously being prescribed by the VA, he's buying heroin on the street. We've got to allow doctors to prescribe what's in the best interests of our veterans, including cannabis.
At a time when it's legal in 29 states, veterans in Texas have come up to me at our town hall meetings and said that while it is the only thing that eases their pain, they are treated as a criminal in our state for seeking it out.
Proud to see the VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act pass the Veterans' Affairs Committee. As a cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation, I know it'll promote research into the safety &amp; use of cannabis for veterans who have been diagnosed with chronic pain, PTSD, &amp; other injuries.
Congratulation to Austin’s Tara Bordeaux, an audio-video teacher at Lanier High School who has earned the title of Texas Teacher of the Year for the second year running!	https://t.co/dv65df4jwk
#TeacherAppreciationWeek also means having the backs of our teachers after they retire. Making sure they are healthy and have access to affordable, high-quality care. Yet TRS faces a $700 million shortfall while overseeing the health of 270,000 retirees. https://t.co/HHOj2DdbnZ
Our public school teachers should have their retirements protected and strengthened by finally receiving cost of living increases and ensuring we end the Windfall Elimination Provision. https://t.co/BuNpDyqnhI

With the first report due May 1, we'll soon have a better understanding of civilian casualties, and how we can increase accountability for the impact we're having abroad.
So I offered a provision to require an annual public report on civilian deaths. Worked across the aisle to pass it through committee. Got it through the full House in a bipartisan fashion &amp; the Senate was able to do the same. Sent to the president's desk, he signed it into law.
For decades, there has been a lack of accountability when it comes to civilian casualties caused by our actions abroad. If we are to be engaged in nations across the world tonight, we should have a full understanding of how our decisions are taking the lives of civilians.
Authored a provision that requires the Secretary of Defense to submit an annual report on civilian casualties caused as a result of U.S. military operations. It is now law. https://t.co/Xe0TMpnZaK

Beyond serving those who put their lives on the line for this country, the VA Secretary leads the nation's second largest department. The nomination, vetting, and confirmation process for this individual should be done with the care our veterans deserve.
We're a bold, confident, big-hearted people. Above the small, petty scare tactics. Don't need to ban individuals of one religion from the shores of a country comprised of immigrants the world over. Don't need to call for patrolling Muslim neighborhoods.

In the midst of a suicide crisis that claims the lives of more than 20 veterans a day, the VA needs a Secretary who is fully committed to serving those who put their lives on the line for our country. This isn't a responsibility that can be taken lightly.

This is part of a larger trend. From trying to privatize public education through vouchers and attempting to role back campus sexual assault policies, DeVos continues to take the Department in the wrong direction. She was confirmed by a one vote margin. This Senate seat matters.

I have joined with colleagues from both sides of the aisle to end the open authorization for endless war. We cannot put the burden of our foreign policy, the problems of the world, soley on the backs of our service members.
Re comments on endless war: we are at war all the time and to what effect? I was a senior in high school when Bush 1 announced US military in Iraq. Have used military force in that country every year and every administration since, no end in sight.
@sctdog You are absolutely right — presidents of both parties have done this and members of Congress from both parties have been complicit.
And if we really care about the civilians being gassed and slaughtered by Assad why are we not accepting Syrian refugees? We are on pace to welcome only 44 this year — FORTY FOUR — in the wealthiest most powerful country the world has ever known. https://t.co/mD9vBfWHoh
We may decide that use of chemical weapons requires a military response. But we must decide that lawfully, as a country, through our representatives in Congress. Holding the president to the law &amp; constitution doesn’t mean we condone Assad nor does it preclude military response.
Only the American people through their representatives in Congress can decide to attack another country that has not attacked us.
This campaign is building on your grassroots momentum each day without any corporate help, any special interests, any PACs. https://t.co/PG5QKvQsfI

In rural conservative Booker, many talked about immigration, dismayed by news that recent grad of Booker high deported. Knew they’d lost out on his potential, what he would do for Booker. Worried about what becomes of him in a country whose language he doesnt speak, w/out family.
When we visited the cotton gin in Roscoe not too long ago the manager told me he can’t find a single person born in Roscoe or nearby Sweetwater to work there. Same for the farmer in Quanah. Last week we were in Goldthwaite at a restaurant opened by immigrants from Jalisco.
Responding to a lot of the hype and fear that gets peddled about immigrants these days, a farmer in Dawson county said that he’s been asking his friends in Lamesa: “have you had a job taken by an immigrant? Your kids? A cousin? Anyone you know?” Answer is always no.

BREAKING: We raised $6.7 million in the first 3 months of 2018. No PACs, no special interests. Just people. More than 141,000 grassroots contributions. Grateful to all of you. RT to share our news. https://t.co/vt0h5Dpg9Q
Jumping in the car tomorrow for a six day, 1,500 mile drive across Texas! 	Hope to see you at town halls in:	🚙Waco	🚙Groveton	🚙Houston	🚙San Saba	🚙Brady	🚙Garden City	🚙Midland	🚙Snyder	🚙Dickens	🚙Floydada 	🚙Silverton 	🚙Lubbock
When running for Congress, I pledged to host a town hall every single month where my constituents could share their ideas, ask questions, and hold me accountable. Today, we held our 93rd. https://t.co/FQP7Cv67So
We'll be back to Waco for our fourth town hall tomorrow. We were at Common Grounds in April, the John Knox Memorial Center in August, and Heritage Creamery in February. https://t.co/yC3hL2d1X7
Beaumont during Harvey recovery https://t.co/N4A2AUJ5vF
Had to take one of our three Tyler town halls outside onto the sidewalk after the fire marshall showed up to Don Juan’s. Enjoyed being back in January when we took questions at New Life Community. https://t.co/3zku75xOsU
Three of those town halls were in Beaumont. We were at Luke's Icehouse a year ago, the Jefferson Theatre in August, and Suga's Deep South Cuisine &amp; Jazz Bar in February. https://t.co/3mK093Npcy

It's been one year since we officially launched our grassroots campaign to represent everyone in Texas. In that time, we've visited 228 counties, held hundreds of town halls, and had the opportunity to meet, listen to, and learn from our fellow Texans across the state. https://t.co/WN2kWhluBy
I want you to be in our state, Max. And I'm going to fight for you. #TransDayofVisibility https://t.co/RyMZPUc2Vw

Mapping the next road trip for this week. We're gonna put 1,500 miles on the car over six days. Pitch in a dollar to help fill the tank, get us to our next town hall, and drive us over our $1,700 goal by midnight. https://t.co/ZB3MbbyeZT https://t.co/1EQjq2CjDf
A Cruz Super PAC raised $1.7 million. We don't have PACs but we have real people working for real change. Can you help us raise $1,700 by midnight? Let's all do it $1 at a time to show how a grassroots campaign works. RT to spread the word. https://t.co/ZB3MbbyeZT

"Whatever small differences we might have, let's put them aside, and let's have an honest, constructive conversation about what we're willing to do for our country right now," O'Rourke said to a standing room-only crowd in A&amp;M's recreation center. https://t.co/IHbP2BasnO
Fortunate to be with the people of Texas in every part of Texas. Listening, learning, and letting those we want to represent drive the conversation and this campaign. https://t.co/SURolnLp3g
Wonderful conversation in Dallas this afternoon for our fourth town hall of an energizing and engaging 24 hours. Grateful to you for joining us. https://t.co/5qb3YBzvWj
Really informative town hall, engaging community meetings, and superior BBQ (Top 5 BBQ run by Mr. Kendon Greene) in DeSoto today. Appreciate you having me and helping me learn what's on the minds of Texans across Dallas County. https://t.co/yXaheOE9G7
"The congressman from El Paso held his third town hall in College Station. O’Rourke said he focuses on campaigning for policy issues, rather than against his opponent because that is what the people of Texas want and deserve." https://t.co/xLa6OFj7rN
Loved joining everyone in Marlin today! Thank you Charlene for bringing us all together with a Falls County town hall. https://t.co/X2EVDphueK
Clean air, safe drinking water, accessible public lands for generations to come. Great question about the environment at our town hall in Marlin. https://t.co/mGaNhkt01O
9:00 on a stormy Wednesday night but everyone came together and shared their ideas for how we move our state and this country in the right direction. https://t.co/uw24zCUzQc
Great night being back in College Station. So many young Texans across the state are taking the lead and fighting for the things we believe in. https://t.co/p8PgKFSeja
We must never privatize the VA. If we want to fulfill our commitment to those who’ve served this country we must invest in the VA, ensure that it delivers the best care and service possible. Hold VA, Congress &amp; POTUS accountable for making it happen.   https://t.co/cV8EOOxTus
Asked about bipartisanship tonight while at our third town hall in College Station. https://t.co/VgYwsTzESs
Secretary David Shulkin made reducing veteran suicide his number one clinical priority, and he has been a strong partner in efforts to expand access to mental health care for those who served. I’m grateful for his commitment to our veterans and our country.
Looking forward to being back in Bryan-College Station tonight. Town hall at 9 in the Texas A&amp;M Recreation Center, Room 243. 797 Olsen Blvd. https://t.co/PUWkCpUW9v
Joe Kennedy took the wheel of the campaign van today in Houston. A good driver and a great friend. https://t.co/if2oj0Jfk7
Always learn so much when I sit down with the Texas Gulf Coast Area Labor Federation, AFL-CIO. Thanks for having me this afternoon, and for your leadership supporting workers across the state. https://t.co/VkIMn7oFXU
This hurts our state. We lose millions in resources for health care, public education, infrastructure, and more. Loss of representation and pull in Federal gov too. We need to put Texas ahead of party. https://t.co/XAkoDDrduG
We must protect the ACA, which ensures you are no longer refused coverage or charged more because of a pre-existing condition like diabetes. But we also need to make it so every Texan can get the care &amp; prescriptions they need before it gets to this point. https://t.co/wKHbwuRVnE
This doesn't add up. Thousands of teachers in communities that desperately need their talents had their $4,000 teaching grants taken away and converted to $5,000 loans.  Unacceptable and needs an immediate investigation. 	https://t.co/d3iEgbm4pI
In Texas, students of color from Pre-K to 2nd grade are five times more likely to receive an out-of-school suspension than their white peers. These actions heavily impact their quality of education -- this is what the school-to-prison pipeline looks like. https://t.co/ZQUilfUBvv
Honored to have the endorsement of @AFGENational in our campaign to represent and advocate for all working people in this state including the more than 200,000 federal employees living in Texas. 	https://t.co/KgmUVAnDx4
Miguel, Jacqueline, and their beautiful daughter Olivia are opening our eyes to the fact that 20,000 Texas babies are born each year with major structural malformations or anomalies. Send them strength and share their story by using the hashtag #LivStrong. https://t.co/cg2b5D1pHR
Young Texans should have access to high-quality preschool—no matter where they live or what their parents make—and failing to fund it puts our state and our students at a disadvantage. https://t.co/9uuDZkjqAs
Beyond these decade-long impacts on Texas families, it will also work in tandem with gerrymandering to erode the voting rights of those in our state and threaten our representation in the Federal government.
For El Paso, Houston, every community across our defining border state, this will mean a loss of millions in resources for health care, public education, infrastructure, disaster relief, and the distribution of federal funds critical to projects in Texas. https://t.co/W2QxAqK4VO
Linda Brown was in the 3rd grade when she put our country on a path towards ending school segregation. To honor her, we must continue on this path by confronting discrimination and ensuring every child has equal access to a high-quality public education. https://t.co/PJxe4y6PGC
Running this campaign with people instead of PACs or special interests allows us to hold town halls across the state where we listen to those we want to represent. On Thursday, we were in Houston. https://t.co/DBfHXKDtWz
An inspiring story of strength. At 100-years-old, Ben Skardon participated in his 11th memorial march in 12 years. His participation makes him not only the oldest marcher but the only survivor to ever walk in the event. https://t.co/eNJ6inEes0

Had the opportunity to meet with Sema Hernandez in Houston. She ran a great campaign focused on the issues that so many of us think about each day. Appreciate Sema sharing her insights, experiences, and advice with me so we can continue working to represent all 28 million Texans. https://t.co/Ymth4oKKpt
Thanks to all who marched with us in El Paso, across Texas, and throughout the country. Essynce was proud to share that she also registered to vote. https://t.co/nbYzXfbZJH
https://t.co/gFTNlDCtLQ
To those marching across Texas, you're the example of what it's going to take. It's the students in Florida, it's the students at every one of the schools who are holding people in positions of public trust accountable and demanding change. https://t.co/Q74zoUsdaf

Enjoyed discussing heathcare, jobs, public education, criminal justice reform, and much more at our Signature Kafe town hall in Houston last night. https://t.co/KOVSQmm9bo
Let's celebrate them this week but support them every week. That means ensuring our tax dollars stay in our public schools, increasing funding for underserved communities, ending the Windfall Elimination Provision, &amp; empowering teachers to teach to their students not a test.
Thankful to the teachers, staff, administrators, nurses, parents, and every Texan who goes to work each day supporting our public schools and giving their all to ensure our kids can reach their full potential. https://t.co/APP1a4aDt0

We're losing 20 veterans a day by suicide. Of those, 14 are individuals with no access to VA health services. This legislation will help those who served us get the care they need. https://t.co/ZLQzs8QEep

My thoughts are with Austin and with the employees at the FedEx facility in Schertz. Your vigilance and willingness to call 911 if you encounter anything suspicious is critical.
We also wanted to know what was on Texans' minds. So we've been showing up and asking them in person at hundreds of town halls across the state. https://t.co/yavCLlhBGx
We're standing strong with Austin. 	https://t.co/sDEKO73Q4G

We are really going to miss Louise Slaughter, an extraordinary American and a gifted leader. I am grateful for her lifetime of service and the example she set in breaking through barriers &amp; standing up for everyone. Our thoughts are with her family, her friends and her staff.

Coming off an incredible weekend of meeting Texans across our state. Here's how we started it on Friday night: https://t.co/ldJ9WRFBVw
Under constant attack, our country's institutions are holding up. They're providing the checks and balances we need. Today's news from the Supreme Court keeps the lower court's decision in place, ruling Trump can't end DACA. https://t.co/z5K0WkEten
Her top concern was healthcare. We hear that everywhere we go. People can't afford to see a doctor or a specialist or get the prescription they need. We've got to lead on universal healthcare. Good for Ms. Edmonds, great for Texas.
Had the wonderful opportunity to meet Ms. Linda Edmonds while knocking doors in Rundberg yesterday. Thanks for welcoming me and taking some time to share what's been on your mind. https://t.co/QCjAGBPm32
.@thedailytexan's endorsement of our campaign:	"A comfortable endorsement if there ever was one...O’Rourke’s widespread support and skyrocketing fundraising are indicative of his proven abilities as a public servant both in El Paso and in Congress." https://t.co/mIvTUtu4tt
Thanks to you, we're running this race the right way. https://t.co/NXgl3iAf2p
Starting the week off right with a running town hall on the steps of our State House https://t.co/DaXj1DcuP4

Showing up to listen in all 254 counties. Writing no person off. Taking no person for granted. That's how we're running this campaign. https://t.co/6KPhRKUOeF
We should lead the way on expanding Medicaid. On making sure Medicare is something you can buy on the exchanges. On getting to true universal healthcare, where everyone can see a provider, afford medication, be well enough to live to their full potential.
At Grace Campus homeless shelter in Lubbock last year - learned that most of those coming in off the streets were unable to pay medical bills, or became so debilitated from an untreated condition that they could not work. Couldnt afford to pay the mortgage, put food on the table. https://t.co/JNoPnWtf7J
Someone at a town hall in December told me his dad killed himself last year - unable to afford a surgery he needed, worried about being a burden on his family. We are the LEAST INSURED state in the country. This is the consequence.
This is happening all over Texas. Families unable to afford the surgeries or cures that will help them to live to their full potential. Or even just live. We need universal health insurance. Texas should lead the way. https://t.co/0enpZ9SRJv
Texas isn’t a red state. We’re a non-voting state. Let’s change that. Early voting continues today. https://t.co/yLHwokl6E2

@attorneydtorres Thanks for being a critical part of our people-powered campaign! Looking forward to seeing you Friday night in Oak Cliff.
We have kids in our state who don't have a home. At the same time, we have prospective parents like this couple willing to provide that home. Let's strike down discrimination wherever it exists and open up opportunity for every Texan. https://t.co/8CeLAHOAl7
Instead of suspending students, we should be supporting them in their advocacy. Let's work with them to promote commonsense gun safety measures that will save lives. https://t.co/6b8a7Lft79
There hasn't even been a discussion allowed in Congress on common-sense gun safety laws. Let's have a debate. We owe our country that much. https://t.co/hlKckPDUBX

"O’Rourke is a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform, renewable energy and improving health care for all. He showed an impressive command of national and international issues during a recent meeting with this Editorial Board." Proud to have the endorsement of @ExpressNews
"O’Rourke, a Democrat from El Paso, has run an energetic and compelling campaign. He has refused to accept money from political action committees but raised $2.4 million in the last quarter of 2017." https://t.co/VPO1hRLvcg
By doing all of this and by focusing on education, we not only have the surest path to individual success for our kiddos but the best path for the collective success of our communities, state, and country.
It also means our public school teachers should have their retirements protected by ensuring that we do away with the Windfall Elimination Provision.
It means we should be empowering teachers to fulfill their calling by having their backs and giving autonomy to teach to their students not to an arbitrary, high-stakes test.
That means fully investing in our public schools, not allowing our public tax dollars to be pulled out of our classrooms and sent to private schools.
Grateful to have the endorsement of the @NEAToday and the @txstateteachers! 	We have heard from teachers, counselors, administrators, and parents in the 220 counties we've visited across Texas. Their message has been clear: access to a quality education must be a priority! https://t.co/B9CUkk88tg
As we were walking to a town hall in Archer City, Paul stopped me to show me this picture of his dad (5th from left) with LBJ during his run for Senate. As far as Paul knew, that was the last time a U.S. senate candidate campaigned in Archer City. https://t.co/zmcuM8ILlh

Trump should withdraw his nomination of Duncan. If he doesn't, senators should oppose his nomination outright. This man has no place passing judgement on anyone in any courtroom in this country. There's most certainly a better nominee for our state.
This includes defending a ban on same-sex marriage, refusing a birth certificate to a child adopted by a same-sex couple, and asking to represent North Carolina legislators during their discriminatory H.B. 2, suggesting transgender individuals are being delusional.
Kyle Duncan has been nominated by Trump to the US Court of Appeals for a region including Texas. He has a long record of undermining LGBTQ rights and has been a lawyer for anti-gay and anti-trans positions in case after case.

And you have to know about Zarate. Brought here at age 8, she juggled jobs at a Cheddar’s restaurant and Burlington Coat Factory while graduating as salutatorian. Now she teaches Spanish and a college readiness program so our kids can succeed just like her.
Yehimi Saquiché was only 10 when her family moved to Texas from Guatemala City. Now she holds a degree in education and 20 pre-k students (and their parents) rely on her showing up to class each day to teach in English and Spanish.
Karen Reyes came to Texas when she was 2. Now trilingual, she contributes to our communities and our future generations as a special-education teacher to hearing-impaired children. We're the one who loses if we send her to a country she doesn't know.

Let's end the process where elected officials choose their voters instead of the other way around. Let's strengthen our Democracy by putting an end to gerrymandering. https://t.co/EAgLe2dD4k
Texas is not a red state. It’s a non voting state. And that’s by design. GOP leaders have drawn Hispanics &amp; African Americans out of congressional districts and, functionally, out of our democracy. Trump commission just following their lead. https://t.co/Dh3PuG6RuS
We have to meet the pettiness, the meanness, the SMALLNESS, the shameful "us vs. them" mentality of our current leaders -- and our current government -- with the confidence, the courage and the STRENGTH of the people of this country.
On to the aspirational things that only a healthy country can achieve -- winning the fight to reverse climate change, finding a cure to Alzheimer's, or AIDS or cancer. Or all of them. Leading humanity in the truly great challenges before us, without fear.
Or what if we could respond to the clear moral choice before us and make sure every kid who needs to can see a doctor, a therapist, receive medication because we no longer debate the authorization for CHIP or quibble about expanding Medicaid?
Like standing up not only for the Dreamers, but also their parents, who decided to leave a hometown, a country that they knew, a language that was familiar -- to come here, to choose us, to give their kids a better chance, to contribute to the success of our country.
But we’ve also got to think beyond funding the government for a full year (as high a bar as that might seem for Congress right now) and reach for something even bigger. Aspirational. Inspiring.
Those who serve this country in uniform expect it of us. Defense Secretary Mattis has talked about the damage done to the readiness of our service members when we fail to fully fund our obligations, and instead limp along under these spending-gap bills.
We can't run government by crisis, lurching from one 30-day funding extension to the next. We also can't neglect the moral questions before us, in the hope that someone else at some point in the future will decide them on our behalf.
But it's not good enough to simply rail against #CitizensUnited. We've got to act. It's why I introduced the No PAC Act. It's why I'm running our campaign without a penny from PACs. It's why I'm putting my trust in the people of Texas not the pocketbooks of special interests.
Helps explain why Congress is captured, corroded, and corrupted by special interests to an extent that we've never seen before. Corporations and PACs are literally purchasing outcomes.
8 years ago, Supreme Court ruled in #CitizensUnited that corporations were people and money was speech. This unleashed a dangerous amount of spending by PACs, corporations, and special interests at the direct expense of our Democracy.
It's time to end #CitizensUnited. https://t.co/9wEQkK7Cqa
400,000 children and pregnant women in Texas rely on CHIP to see a doctor. 200,000 Dreamers contribute to our state's success each day. We, the most powerful country in the world, can do the right thing by both.
Inspired by the thousands of women marching in the DFW area and to all those making their voices heard across Texas. Wish I was in Texas right now --- but I'm with you in spirit! https://t.co/lDGWBAvYmA
Shutdown is a failure in leadership: Speaker who can’t bring a full year’s funding bill to the floor. President who rescinded DACA &amp; won’t honor the agreement made to save it. Members of Congress who enable this and fail to insist on full year funding &amp; keeping families together
Dreamers are not illegal. https://t.co/Mfqa3mbKvl
Giving an update from D.C. right now on Facebook Live. Tune in https://t.co/JZETsPaLzi
Agreed. Let’s sit down, listen to each other &amp; figure out how to fund government for the whole year. Enough self-imposed crisis. Enough wasteful &amp; destructive CR bills. Bad for our country, our military, our veterans. Bad for everyone. We can do better. Will require leadership. https://t.co/HUhaodgMFr
So let's move with the example of this morning. Let's bring all sides into the room, let's listen, let's share ideas, let's hold true to our values and ensure we do the right thing on DACA. All of that is within our power to do. And it's the correct path forward for our country.
Believe it or not, there is actually bipartisan agreement on the need to keep the government running and pass a long-term funding bill. There is agreement on the DREAM Act, on funding CHIP, on the important and timely things we need to do.
It also continued the reckless course of short-term funding, falling short on our commitment to the Dept of Defense, VA, CBP , and all those who serve. Let's fund them not weeks at a time but  for the rest of the year so we can address the challenges &amp; opportunities before us.
For starters, it failed to reflect even the faintest input from members of both parties. Republican leadership in both the House and Senate gave Democrats no opportunity to participate in the discussions.That’s not how Congress should work.
I wish I could say the results were instant, that Congress took our lead and held a bipartisan discussion on government funding by the afternoon. But that wasn't the case. Instead, there was a party-line vote on a short-term funding bill for the FOURTH time since Oct. I voted no.
Started today by sitting down with No Labels and the Problem Solvers Caucus -- Democrats and Republicans from both the House and the Senate sitting across the table from one another, talking, listening, and most importantly, working together.
All at a time when we’re spending $20 billion a year to secure the border, where there are already 600 miles of walls and fences, where we already have twice as many border patrol agents than in 2004 with 20,000 continuing to make sure we are safe. Let's keep the facts in mind.
It takes our eye off of real problems, real threats, and therefore makes us LESS SAFE. At a time of record safety along the border, when we have the lowest levels of apprehensions along the US-Mexico border in recent history, not zero but less than zero net Mexican migration.
True key to securing border is treating each other with respect and dignity. That includes the country of Mexico, on which nearly 1 million jobs in Texas depend — 6 million throughout US. The wall is immoral, irresponsible, unnecessary and a colossal waste of resources and focus. https://t.co/XHvwihNV4S

El Paso is also home to more than 9,000 Dreamers, young Americans who make us a better, safer, stronger community. Let’s focus on keeping them here, contributing to our success... instead of building walls that we don’t need.
Walls have nothing to do with it. We’ve been ranked 1st, 2nd or 3rd safest city for last 20 years, including before any wall. In addition to great law enforcement, our safety is connected to the fact that we are a city of immigrants. We treat eachother with respect &amp; dignity. https://t.co/VS6XQyEEFs
@PressSec Walls have nothing to do with it. We have been ranked 1st, 2nd, or 3rd safest city in the U.S. for 20 years (including years before wall). On top of great law enforcement, our safety is connected to being a community of immigrants. We treat eachother with respect and dignity.

Stop the process where members of Congress choose their voters instead of the other way around. Stop drawing people out of their democracy. Let's take the lead in Texas.
We should have a non-partisan, non-politician redistricting commission that ends the practice of racial gerrymandering. https://t.co/nFSt5O8E3d

"If El Salvador did get them back, the resulting shock would likely increase migration to the United States...We know because most are ending up at the Texas border." https://t.co/hI07z5SXoC?
Congratulations to the @HoustonChron — their reporting forced accountability for Texas denying special needs children an education. 		Example of how the press is not “the enemy of the people” - instead, critical to effective government for the people. https://t.co/BKa5LxjMWs
Congress voted today to sacrifice liberty for security. Bill allows government to search our communications without a warrant under the premise of fighting terrorism. I voted “no”. https://t.co/vvZTDSFG8d
The way that Trump talks about Mexicans, Haitians and Central Americans is not too different from how racists and “America first” proponents were talking about Irish, Italians and Polish not too long ago. We will once again overcome this anti-immigrant nativism.
Haitians, El Salvadorans join distinguished list of people who’ve made our country better after making tough decision to leave theirs. I’m glad you’re here and will fight for you to stay! https://t.co/ZDLGCjMNWJ

About to go live with CNN. Join us in hitting the ground running this morning. https://t.co/6vyQhlGj13
Looking forward to discussing this and more on CNN’s @NewDay tomorrow (Thursday) morning at 6:45 ET/5:45 CT. I hope you’ll tune in if you’re an early riser.
This is all to say that we need a clean Dream Act. It not only has bipartisan support in Congress but it has bipartisan support across the country. 86% of voters overall and 75% among Republicans.
While the country would lose between $283 billion and $430 billion, Texas would be the second hardest hit state with an economic loss of $6 billion/year. This after our state had the largest GDP growth in the nation during the first quarter of last year.
And Dreamers are working hard for their success. 76% are currently employed. An additional 20% are not working but are enrolled in school. The right-leaning Cato Institute found that the economic loss of Dreamers would be measured not in the millions but in the billions.
Let's be on the right side of history for 200,000 Dreamers in Texas and the 9,000 eligible DACA recipients I represent in El Paso. They contribute to the fact that our binational community has been ranked as the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd safest city in the country for more than a decade.
We’ve got to have the courage of our convictions in memory of Alonso Guillen, a Dreamer who died while saving his fellow Texans from the destructive flooding of Hurricane Harvey. Those he saved needed him.
We’ve got to do right by Melissa who is finishing up her final semester of a mathematics degree. Here since age five, she is making our community safer as an intern with the Labor Justice Commission protecting Texans from wage theft and human trafficking. We need her.
We’ve got to do the right thing for Texas Tech student Saba who was brought to our country at age 11 and is now finishing up her PhD in mathematical biology, ready to help understand diseases and even explore new cures. We need her.
Was stopped by a group of Texas Dreamers on the way to vote today. They are making their voices heard, sharing their stories, and keeping the pressure on Congress to do the right thing. Their state supports them. https://t.co/0UzWUaeDGS
On the way to Fox News. Hope you'll tune in at 8:00 ET/7:00 CT.
"Congress is playing with the lives of real people we all know. They aren’t just another policy and shouldn’t be held hostage by lawmakers or the President" Today's @startelegram editorial makes the case, we need a clean Dream Act.	 https://t.co/nKsOIToNf8
Let's take temporary and make it permanent. Let Congress vote on a clean Dream Act so we can do the right thing for the 800,000 Dreamers and our nation as a whole. https://t.co/IynI0L2ZBc

400,000 kids in Texas are about to lose the ability to see a doctor, a therapist, a nurse — the caregivers  who will be able to improve or save their lives. Republicans in Congress have prioritized tax cuts over Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

All of that and too much more. Only 33% of Americans approve of the plan. Even fewer (21%) think they will be better off if it becomes law. Texans are paying attention. Texans know what's happening. And Texans won't forget.
Thanks to our junior senator, $500 million in tax payer money will be pulled out of our public schools to benefit wealthy parents and private schools. No wonder teachers are outraged.
Say you're lucky enough to still be insured, you'll see premiums go up an average of $1,730 a year. So much for a tax break if you're paying more for the ability to see a doctor.
Causes 13 million more people to be uninsured. One million in Texas alone, the least insured state in the union.
Sends 83% of tax breaks to the top 1%. At the expense of 86 million middle class households who will see tax increases (that's HALF of American middle class families!).
I voted no. https://t.co/gTM4tRncHf
Lots to focus on in this tax bill. 1 million more Texans uninsured, premiums go up $1,700 in TX, 83% of breaks go to richest 1%, public schools screwed, inequality spikes. But did you know it hurts our veterans too? https://t.co/NUjQvWqJ0N
Who wins: Trump Org, major corporations, tax lawyers		Who loses: Everyone else		 https://t.co/JpGgCMyA6N
This will hurt our public school students, our public school teachers, librarians and nurses. It will result in more inequality in our country. Not good for our country, not good for Texas. It’s another reason I will vote NO on the tax bill today.

We should hold those from out-of-state to Texas’ standards when they travel to our communities. We should not subject ourselves to the lowest common denominator in the U.S. because that will make Texas less, not more, safe. https://t.co/M04VT9DxDV
Texas doesn’t issue to people convicted of stalking. 21 other states do.
Texas doesn’t issue to violent offenders. 22 other states do.
Texas does not issue a license to carry to abusive partners. 14 other states do.
Under this bill, Texas’ high standards for gun safety will be compromised by low standards in other states. For ex: Texas law requires safety training to qualify for a licence to carry. 18 other states do not.
Texas has a proud tradition of gun ownership and gun safety. Let’s not compromise it. https://t.co/j0F4xHkuXc

I will continue working to pass a bipartisan CHIP &amp; CHC reauthorization that invests in our kids' health &amp; doesn’t sabotage the ACA.
Also slashes the ACA's premium grace period by 60 days -- results in up to 688,000 low &amp; moderate income people losing healthcare.

All this damage to critical programs just to make room for tax cuts -- 80% of which go to the wealthiest 1%. Not to the middle class.
We’ll definitely feel this one in Texas: $200 billion stripped from transportation funding. Hits highways, bridges &amp; transit.
Unfortunately, there's more. It hammers WIC, a nutrition program that serves 53% of all infants born in the US: $6.5 billion in cuts.
Education slashed too. #Budget eliminates Head Start for 25,000 kids/year &amp; cuts Pell Grants for nearly 8 million students.
Also cuts a trillion dollars from Medicaid. Texas’ uninsured rate (highest in nation!) will spike.
Voting NO on the #budget tomorrow. It’s bad for Texas. Medicare cut by $473 million -- a program that 3.6 million Texans are enrolled in.

"Military style" (Trump's words) immigration crackdowns make our cities less, not more, safe as fewer immigrants report crimes, work w/ PD.
Undermining ACA causes fewer, not more, Americans to have insurance &amp; will reduce quality of insurance for those lucky enough to have it.
Decertifying Iran deal strengthens their hand and weakens ours. Makes it more likely, not less, that they will develop nuclear weapon.
Just about every Trump move so far has had the opposite of the intended effect.
Iran deal best path to keep Iran from having nuclear weapons. Decertifying undermines this, creates uncertainty, separates us from allies.

This is an irresponsible &amp; immoral budget. I will be voting "no" when it comes up later today. Hope you will urge other members to join me.
And while programs for health, education and nutrition are decimated, this budget provides tax breaks for wealthiest totaling $2.6 trillion.
This budget also hammers #SNAP: $150 billion will be cut from a hunger program that helps 3,882,875 Texans -- 180,600 in El Paso alone.
But wait, there's more. It cuts the #PellGrant program by $75 billion and slashes other student loan programs by another $120 billion.
Also cuts $1.5 trillion from Medicaid and the ACA, programs which help families across Texas gain access to care &amp; live healthy lives.
Medicare beneficiaries would see their average premium spike by 25% over the next 10 years.

Thanks El Paso for coming out yesterday to help our fellow Texans recover from Harvey! Good to be home with family and friends. https://t.co/lbscVrK80h
Grateful for the life &amp; work of Paul Moreno. Served El Paso &amp; Texas as our conscience on civil rights &amp; championing the poor &amp; forgotten.
Dreamers are part of the positive future of Texas. DACA makes it possible for them to stay, excel &amp; give back to their country, the USA.
A lot of need there. They're rescuing people w no place to take them. No shelters or buses out of town to take those rescued to shelters.
As one firefighter told me "20 of us started work last Thursday. And despite everything we've all lost, all 20 are still here tonight."
You can see members of a team that traveled two days from Guanajuato Mexico to help out. Extraordinary compassion, courage and kindness.
