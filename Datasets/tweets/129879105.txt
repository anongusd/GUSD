Fox confirms via two sources familiar that California Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein met privately this morning with former Vice President Joe Biden as he’s considering a run for the White House. Sources say Feinstein expects Biden to run.
A “Friends of Joe” group, which has been inactive since 2016, is quite busy now with a flurry of emails, conversations, and activities. Some close to Biden suggest with his name ID and long record he does not need to get in the mix now – he can wait before moving forward.
Source with direct knowledge confirms Biden’s personal outreach to former colleagues, grassroots activists, and asking donors for their help ahead of an announcement. With such a crowded field, Biden clearly wants to keep big donors and potential staffers with him.
A source with direct knowledge tells #FoxNews former Vice President Joe Biden is almost certain to run for President in 2020. This source says the timing is still up in the air.

Senior Congressional aides add on ICE component: 	•           It would allow ICE to respond to surges in apprehensions	•           Enough flexibility to reach the President’s requested level of 52,000 beds https://t.co/LqmpkRF8Hp
Senior Congressional aides on ICE parts of deal:	•     NO internal enforcement cap	•     5,000 detention beds above the record level of funding provided in FY2018	•     Secures for ICE the funding and flexibility necessary to maintain its current detention population
More from Senior Congressional aides:	•           Border Patrol can use any currently deployed design (including steel slats)	•           All of the miles will be in the Rio Grande Valley sector – Border Patrol’s highest priorities on its strategic plan https://t.co/uefCToixxX
Senior Congressional aides tell FOX:	•           All of the $1.375B funding can be used for new miles of border wall	•           This will fund approximately 55 new miles – double the amount of new miles provided in FY18 and nearly three times as much as would have been in a CR
Source familiar tells #FoxNews about this agreement: $1.375 billion for physical barriers. No wall.		“We reduce the number of ICE detention beds by 17.4 percent, putting a critical check on the Trump administration’s mass deportation policy that is tearing communities apart.”

Democrats celebrate deal to reopen government as GOP warns opposition to get serious about border security - from #SpecialReport tonight:		https://t.co/ZT0i9WUMWc
SENATE ACTION ON GOVERNMENT FUNDING DEAL --&gt; Adopted by Voice Vote: H.J. Res. 28, as amended (Short term CR through February 15th) and H.J. Res. 31, as amended (sends DHS Appropriations to Conference and authorizes the appointment of Conferees).
For those scoring at home, President Trump just confirmed February 15th date-&gt; https://t.co/82UY20BC8O
President Trump announces in the Rose Garden a deal has been reached to end the shutdown and reopen the government. He's now praising the federal employees who have been furloughed for 35 days.
The Senate Stands in Recess Subject to the Call of the Chair	-- all eyes right now on the Rose Garden.
-&gt; https://t.co/EsJ0foYtrl
Many other sources are very quiet, very cautious not wanting to comment until the President speaks in the Rose Garden at approximately 1:30pm.
A well-placed source tells #FoxNews they appear to be close on a Continuing Resolution to fund the government through February 15th with NO Border barrier funding. If there is no deal by then, the expectation is the President will declare a national emergency and build the wall.
Senior Republican sources on Capitol Hill says the expectation is President Trump will say something about the shutdown today.

With 49 Senate DEMS opposed to the Thomas Farr nomination, and retiring Sen. Jeff Flake saying he's a NO, Sen. Tim Scott would be a 51st NO vote. That's why Senate Dem leader Chuck Schumer is declaring victory. #Farr #Breaking
“Senator Tim Scott has done a courageous thing, and he’s done the right thing. Thomas Farr has been involved in the sordid practice of voter suppression for decades and never should have been nominated, let alone confirmed to the bench. Thankfully, he won’t be.”-@SenSchumer
#FoxNews confirms via a senior aide to @SenatorTimScott that he will oppose the nomination of Thomas Farr to the federal bench.

"President Trump has taken bold action on behalf of the American people. Congress has not held up its end of the deal, but we can change that. It’s time to do what we said.”-Rep. @Jim_Jordan 2 of 2 running for Speaker
“Should the American people entrust us with the majority again in the 116th Congress, I plan to run for Speaker of the House to bring real change to the House of Representatives."-Rep. @Jim_Jordan 1 of 2
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) is running for Speaker of the House in the new Congress. Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about Jordan for Speaker, and Ryan noted he won't be here. Plus, Ryan is supporting Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA).
