Gelernt argued: “A case always takes into account further developments and I think this is one, (the further developments were) a bombshell no one could have anticipated.” 7/
“I understand the appeal with (ACLU’s Lee) Gelernt's pitch that he wants an accounting ... but it’s simply not what he’s after. That’s the alluring step 1 and then once that foot is in the door it’s gojng to be expensive invasive requirements on the government," he said.  6/
DOJ attorney Scott Stewart argued it was too much to shift the case now, and the appropriate thing would be a new lawsuit. He said having to reunify all of those families after the government already went “above and beyond” was a “dramatic” shift. 5/
“The very fundamental premise of the lawsuit was there was an unlawful separation practice instituted by this administration,” Sabraw said. In “an allegation of wrong on this scale, one of the most fundamental obligations of law is to determine the scope of the wrong.” 4/
Sabraw called the IF report “a very significant event” that “appears to be 100% factual,” so the ACLU couldn’t have known that more families needed to be ID'd when the lawsuit ordered reunifications.  	“Once they acted, it turns out this may only be the top of the iceberg.” 3/
He is taking the request for consideration, saying he’ll issue an order on the request "as quickly as i can,” understanding "the enormity” of it. 2/
Potentially big: Judge Sabraw sounds inclined to agree with ACLU that *all* separated families must be identified, even those separated before his court ruling. Said it seemed “arbitrary” to exclude those released before June. Potentially thousands would have to be identified 1/
“We the government cannot guarantee perfection in our system.”		DOJ attorney Scott Stewart just now in court in ongoing the family separations case.		(Explaining that what they can promise is working in good faith)

@Haleaziz @JuliaEAinsley Also BTW — in FY16, 14% of ICE arrests were of noncriminals, so 86% were criminal arrests.
@DLind @Haleaziz @JuliaEAinsley I’ll admit when I tweeted I didn’t realize the final orders figure was 3%pts of the total, but the charges only figure are a bigger deal, yes.
@Haleaziz @JuliaEAinsley "In FY2018, ERO arrested 158,581 aliens, 90% of whom had criminal convictions (66%), pending criminal charges (21%), or previously issued final orders (3%). The overall arrest figure represents an 11% increase over FY2017.”	https://t.co/EunVhLSPGl
@Haleaziz @JuliaEAinsley also this figure is wrong — 90% are convicted, charged OR “fugitive” meaning they have a final order of removal. Actual number of criminals was about 64% in FY18

The people living in these communities are “talked around."	“Nobody wants to help because  of the color of their skin or where they come from or where they live at,” Latiker says, adding after a time the communities “believe the violence is more prevalent than the hope is.”
Someone (Karen Bass) finally addresses a Q to Diane Latiker, an activist from Chicago: 	“As I sit here I listen to the back and forth about gun violence and to me it leaves out the most important part, which is those who have to deal with it on a daily basis,” Latiker says 1/
…Following Trump’s lead, Republicans have used MS-13 as a stand-in for all evil. They’re evil for sure, but they’re a tiny tiny percentage of gang violence in this country. Trump cites them because they are deeply tied to Central America (though started in US).
I know this is really beside the point, but McClintock cites MS-13 as an example of how “criminals and madmen” will not obey gun laws, but MS-13 is notorious for killings using machetes, not guns...
Deutch asks survivor Aalayah Eastmond about her work to also highlight gun violence in minority and urban communities. 	She says she is seeking to “share the platform I didn’t ask to have with those marginalized communities.”
Rep. Deutch, who represents Parkland, acknowledges the work of the families and survivors: “They never signed up for this, they would to anything to change this. They don’t owe us their service and advocacy, they don’t owe us anything. Congress failed them; we didn’t do our job.”

RT @KFILE: .@auctnr1 says he’s auctioning his tie to benefit St. Jude.		https://t.co/3aXOUVOiKR
So to recap, here’s the GOP approach so far at this gun violence hearing:	Collins: The Dems’ proposal doesn’t actually work the way they say.	Gohmert: Criminals get their guns illegally anyway.	Gaetz: “If we really cared about safer streets we would build a wall.”
As there is yet another parliamentary inquiry, hot mic catches someone saying “Oh Jesus Christ…"
“If we really cared about safer streets we would build a wall,” Gaetz concludes.
Now Gaetz calls it “hurtful” that as he focuses on connecting illegal immigration to violence (factually: there is no correlation there) that a colleague would imply he’s saying something factually incorrect.
Now Collins has a parliamentary inquiry about Cicilline’s parliamentary inquiry. Nadler is calmly responding and trying to move things along.
Nadler: “The factuality of any statement is always subject to contest by somebody who disagrees with it,” and it is the “prerogative” of another member to dispute it in their time.	Adds: “it is never permissible for members of the audience to comment or vociferously object.”
As Gaetz is repeatedly interrupted by audience, Cicilline asks in a “point of order” whether there’s any rule against a member reciting false statements, or  “are members of Congress just entitled to make things up in support of specious arguments?” https://t.co/hTLms6dNpf
…And yes, he did bring it back to the wall.
Good grief, why was this so popular in the 80s? 	Can we at least hope that people will learn from this experience that it’s wrong going forward...? https://t.co/QC2DMQ6psI
Gaetz is now using his turn in this gun violence hearing to list a bunch of crimes allegedly committed by undocumented immigrants...
This is always the problem with bringing witnesses to hearings that have real, powerful personal experiences to testify. After their emotional opening statements, they often don’t get asked any questions because it’s awkward for members to do so and make a political point.
Grammar nerd alert: Sheila Jackson Lee’s name placard at this hearing has her name hyphenated as Jackson-Lee, but she doesn’t hyphenate.

It’s already noticeable the difference in hearings with Dems in charge. Minority only gets a few witnesses, so you have a student who survived a school shooting and a sheriff’s official who heads a domestic violence unit next to a professor testifying guns will help self defense
@kuriouskitt https://t.co/n1mxJfMfw0
Continues with Maj. Sabrina Tapp-Harper, commander of Baltimore Sheriff’s Domestic Violence Unit, who is testifying about the increased risk to domestic violence victims from firearms.
So far every Dem witness at the gun violence hearing have made sure to emphasize not just mass shootings, but the scourge of gun violence in minority communities. 	“Their stories often go untold,” says trauma surgeon and survivor Dr. Joseph V. Sakran.
Closes: “I refuse to live in fear. Yes, I am a rape survivor, but the 9mm I carry on my hip allows me to stay strong, stand tall and say confidently, ‘Never again.’ But more importantly, I want my ‘never again’ to be other women’s ‘never going to happen.’”
Second witness is a college gun rights activist who was sexually assaulted at college: “Because of so-called common-sense gun laws, I was left defenseless that night,” Savannah Lindquist says. 	“I obeyed the law as a responsible gun owner and it ended in me being raped.”
Very unusual in a congressional hearing: Aalayah Eastmond, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, just got a standing ovation at the end of her statement.	Nadler has to remind the audience they can’t make noise during hearings... https://t.co/Drlw5Y5pul
The poise of these Parkland teens after everything they’ve been through will never cease to amaze me.
A member of the Judiciary Committee just made Nadler re-administer the oath to the witnesses in today’s gun violence hearing because he left out “so help me God” the first time. He obliged.

@DavidNakamura Calling “fowl” seems more appropriate...
@2on2out It’s like evolution — if that wasn’t an effective survival strategy, it wouldn’t catch on.
We’ve become so obsessed with who is right about “the wall” that there’s a lot of more important stuff we’re ignoring. And at this point, no one wants to “lose.” So the cycle repeats.  8/8
So now here we are: Government is shut down because we’ve dug ourselves into this “I want a wall” / “You can’t have a wall” trap. No ability to say, this $1B for this fencing is reasonable, here we’re going to do $1B for technology, etc. 7/
And one slice of this is also the media, which tends toward covering “the wall” because it’s tangible, lots of $$$ and requires a lot less legal mumbo jumbo to explain than, say, raising the credible fear threshold. 6/
And for Democrats, it’s the same purpose — being super against the wall is a much easier way to signify being welcoming than anything else. Nevermind that it’s really a bunch of other policies that Trump’s admin is pursuing + ICE that have more far-reaching consequences.
A lot of politicians are still using that definition because it’s easier than describing what they actually want. 	For Trump's base, it stands in for the real goal — basically shutting down the border to anyone unwelcome. Nevermind that a wall alone can’t really do this 100%. 4/
RT @DavidNakamura: Finally found the real fake news. https://t.co/j0FuWXOH8H
Trump’s administration almost immediately defined the wall differently than his 2,000 mile, 30-foot concrete imagery of his campaign. It took him some time to catch up. 3/
From Nielsen in April:	“To us it’s all new wall. If there was a wall before that needs to replaced, that’s new wall. This is Trump’s border wall.”	And Oct. “This looks like a wall. … Not only is it see-through … it’s different than a fence in that it’s part of a system.” 2/
A mini rant thread about “the wall.” 	“The wall” has always been a symbol. Sometimes it’s a symbol of an actual massive wall, sometimes it’s not. It’s always imbued with meaning by its speaker. 1/

This bears repeating every day we remain in this shutdown: 	We have government shutdowns because lawmakers believe the suffering of Americans will give them greater leverage to negotiate AND right now is next to the only thing forcing them to actually legislate.

Trump seems extremely perturbed by the detail (that he denies) that he pounded the table before saying “bye bye” and abruptly leaving negotiations with Schumer and Pelosi. All of the rest of the scene he corroborates word-for-word, but that table thing bothers him.

I shouldn’t neglect to mention that a large number of these women are groundbreaking women of color, another hugely important fact.
It’s worth taking a minute to appreciate how groundbreaking for women in politics the 116th Congress is. Breaking records of numbers of women serving, having a woman 3rd in line for the presidency, having GOP women serving on Senate Judiciary for the first time, the list goes on.

Now we’re here: Yesterday HHS announced it would cut one of the fingerprint requirements it had instituted back in June, which they hope will result in 2,000+ children being released very soon. But the rest of the June agreement remains in place: https://t.co/jjX0GvLTTd   9/9
Then last week we were topping 14,700 as ICE confirmed it had arrested nearly 200 undocumented immigrants (nearly 2/3 of whom had no criminal record) after background checking them to take in children: https://t.co/3WibJYRkMf 8/
We hit a new record number of kids in custody in November, breaking 14,000 for the first time, as a temporary tent facility in Texas accommodating this growth also continued to expand: https://t.co/4b65lfIPF8 7/
Legislation was quickly introduced to try to block the practice, but is not likely going anywhere in GOP-controlled Washington: https://t.co/Xka514Jfsf 6/

But even as separations ended and reunifications proceeded, the number of children in custody kept climbing. An official told me that the pace of releasing children had plummeted, largely because of the vetting: https://t.co/plMeJhRihx 4/
In response to concern about knowing what happened to those kids, an HHS-DHS agreement was signed to do more vetting of sponsors, right as family separations were sending 2,500+ kids into the system with no plans originally for reunification https://t.co/cZ2gyrU5m7 3/

There’s a long legal path before the ACA is back before SCOTUS and there will be for DACA too, but it’s hard to believe Congress will suddenly be able to overcome its deep divisions on either issue even if the courts create urgency. Health care could be telltale for immigration.
Part of the rationale from Trump for canceling DACA was to light a fire under Congress and force them to actually legislate on immigration. A plan that substantially failed this year. The admin and its backers in Congress often blame the courts for that, for keeping DACA open. 4/
Also similarly, there’s been a lot of (often bipartisan) talk of a need for Congressional intervention on both issues to fix the system, but Congress can never seem to get itself on the same page. Some of the key aisle-crossers on the issues also overlap.	3/
First of all, quite obviously, GOP opponents of Obamacare and DACA have both chosen the 5th Circuit and Texas for their legal challenges. The ruling invalidating Obamacare could be followed by another Texas ruling invalidating DACA. 	2/
In the wake of the Texas ACA decision, I can’t shake the eeriness of the symmetry between health care and immigration. How this case proceeds may be a window into what could happen with DACA. 	1/

“Say what you want out loud” - Olivia Milch	#WomenRule #RuleWithUs
Major takeaway from the women at #WomenRule: women have to negotiate and ask for compensation that reflects their value. Far too many don’t. Alma Adams’ COS Rhonda Fox says men always do, and their office makes sure young women negotiate their salary. #RuleWithUs
Milch notes that whispers always follow a women-led film that flops, while men-led films flop all the time and no one doubts them.	“Faith, not fear,” should guide people, she says. 	#WomenRule #RuleWithUs
“The work is the work, and the work doesn’t care what you think about yourself,” says Olivia Milch, a screenwriter. “Progress not perfection,” she adds. 	#WomenRule #RuleWithUs
Mimi Leder says that being a woman does mean she lost on some opportunities in her career, but did not lose on life. 	Says when opportunities come they come, and when they don’t, they don’t.  #WomenRule
Daniel Stiepleman says there’s an incredibly “low bar” for what qualifies as a supportive husband and father. Says his aunt and uncle Ruth Bader and Marty Ginsburg were his role models.	#WomenRule #rulewithus
@politico #rulewithus - curious if for On The Basis of Sex a woman director felt like an important priority.
Daniel Stiepleman says he asked RBG (who is his aunt) if he could make the movie and she said: “If that’s how you want to spend your time...”	Adds she loves the film and Felicity Jones’ performance.

Ernst answers question about campaigning with Trump, says she would welcome Trump to Iowa.	Shaheen: “I don’t expect to campaign with President Trump.”	Big laugh.	#WomenRule #rulewithus
Sen. Shaheen on California and others moving up primaries: 	“You can’t run in California the same way you can run in Iowa and New Hampshire,” Shaheen says. “You have to engage with voters.”	Sen. Ernst agrees, says Iowa and N.H. will remain key primary states.	#2020 #WomenRule
Sen. Ernst (next to Sen. Shaheen) on being #FITN in 2020:	“The voters in Iowa and N.H., they fully expect that a presidential candidate will sit down at their kitchen table and have a conversation with them.”	“We imagine it will get hot and heavy very, very soon.” #WomenRule
Ernst on Khashoggi:	“It was outright murder, we know that,” but says that’s separate from Yemen fight and peace talks. 	Shaheen: “The rest of the world is watching what we do. We need to let Saudi Arabia know that that kind of behavior is not acceptable.”	#WomenRule

“I think Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker,” says former anti-Pelosi letter signer Brian Higgins.
“There is no alternative and there is no semblance of an alternative,” says former Pelosi naysayer Rep. Higgins. If opponents don’t repent, he says, “you would create a space for someone undeserving to seize it.”
“I think this is great. Democracy is a sloppy mess,” says Rep. Brian Higgins, on opposing Pelosi and then negotiating with her for his support. He now says she is building a disparate coalition and is very effective.
Brian Higgins, who signed the letter against Pelosi and then backed her after some policy commitments, says some of the other naysayers “want an out” and he’s told them now is the time to use their leverage and cut a deal.

If this proclamation works the way it’s designed, it will “funnel” migrants to legal border crossings, which already have 1,000-person lines at times (https://t.co/WyQdy46gEy). Those waiting in line wait in — you guessed it — Mexico. 7/

Mexico has done a lot to intercept migrants traveling through its country, actually deporting more migrants each year than the US, but it has hesitated to make itself responsible for every migrant that passes through, and humanitarian groups have concerns about this 4/
The US has such an agreement with Canada, but not with Mexico. Needless to say, such an agreement would effectively mean almost no one could seek asylum in the US unless they flew or boated into the US. 3/
In plain language, the administration says it will stop denying asylum to those who cross illegally on the very date that Mexico agrees to a “safe third country” arrangement, meaning that the US could reject any asylum seeker who traveled through Mexico on their way to the US 2/

@DLind I guess it depends whether you’re counting Sessions’ public influence or private influence in the administration.  But I don’t think we’re in much disagreement, overall
@DLind Not sure I’d put it that way. For one, he played a huge role in the eventual family separations. I’d say he was better at keeping his fingerprint off the flashiest stuff, at least publicly. But I agree that much of what he put into place could outlast him.

@timkmak For there to be enough votes to trigger a runoff:	1973105*2=3946210	+1 =3,946,211	-1973105-1910393-37088=	25,624	And Kemp would have to win 0 of those.
@JonPKay @Matt_Lawson21 @timkmak Question is how many ballots would have to be left to make it possible to dilute him to below 50%
@timkmak So if the 20K number is accurate, seems impossible?
@Roy_ViolaJr Yep, including that one.
@timkmak 1973105+1910393+37088+20000 = 3940586	/2	=1,970,293

First words: “At your request" https://t.co/6gj2rhGH2b

“I heard the President say I deserve to the speaker. I don’t think anybody deserves anything. It’s not about what you have done, it’s about what you can do,” Pelosi says.	“I think I’m the best person to go forward to unify, to negotiate”
Pelosi says she encourages women lawmakers to add a national security credential to their name so they are a face of that and not just relegated to niche issues
Pelosi asked about Trump saying Dems won’t get his tax returns and threatening them over investigations.	“The President also said this was a good day for Republicans,” Pelosi responds.
Pelosi loves quoting Reagan, and loves talking about how much she loves to quote Reagan.
Trump says without him, Dems would have had a blue wave.	Pelosi says it’s remarkable they flipped the House at all “when you think of how gerrymandered the country is.”	#spingame
Pelosi says Ryan called to congratulate her this morning:	“We discussed how it is to win, and how it is not to win.”
Trump called his conversation with Pelosi last night “warm.”	She says that they discussed where they can work together, namely infrastructure
He loves it https://t.co/RrqfpEV0Ht
Also on the ballot? “It was a vote to restore the health of our democracy,” she continues.
“Voters delivered a resounding verdict,” Pelosi says. “Now they want a new direction, a House that will work to make progress in the lives of America’s families and seniors”
“We made our own environment,” Pelosi continues in victory lap presser.
“Health care was on the ballot and health care won,” Pelosi begins https://t.co/1G6sjZC0ka

Trump just suggested a Dem House could send legislation to the Senate to pass mostly with Dem support and a handful of Republicans. 	This is (1) not something he’s been willing to do thus far, and (2) not likely to please Mitch McConnell
Actually, I’m not sure if he was talking about a GOP or Dem majority in the House. Maybe both

McConnell on judgeships: 	“We intend to keep confirming as many as we possible can as long as we are in a position to do it."
McConnell says voters seem to like divided government. “I think the message is figure out what you can do together and do it.”	(Question was about health care)
McConnell doesn’t signal an appetite for a trench fight on border wall funding: “We all know we need to work together here,” on appropriations, he says. “Hopefully we will not be headed down that path” of a shutdown.
In that time, the Senate will have a solid majority with which to confirm judicial and Cabinet nominees for two years. 7/
And many of the most boldly progressive candidates who were the stars of the cycle fell short in those key states. It makes a strong argument for a 2020-er like a Gretchen Whitmer or Sherrod Brown, but they start with a tremendous name recognition deficit 6/
Looking at governor races is also key. Democrats definitely rebuilt in the Midwest, but the suburban angst that gave them the House did not help them in statewide races that are almost essential to 270 in the presidential, namely Florida, Ohio, Iowa. 5/
But dismissing the Senate bloodbath as “the map was always terrible” doesn’t really explain how Dems recover from that. And it raises big questions about an electoral college map in 2020. 4/
Taking the House will position Dems to give Trump hell with oversight, and give them a firewall on legislation/leverage to negotiate (if anyone feels like negotiating during #2020 campaigning, which seems unlikely) 3/
First things first: Flipping the House is a big win. Can’t help but think today of all the times Rep. Dave Brat and other staunch conservatives poo-pooed the “but will that work in the Senate?” question by saying the House is the body closest to the true desires of the people 2/

If on Tuesday the GOP manages to keep control of both the House and Senate, hard to see how it won’t be interpreted as a mandate to go full bore on immigration.
@darth Darth I can’t like this when you’ve already tweeted this before and I liked it then, too
And Congress remains hopelessly unable to reach any consensus on how to fix it. Neither party has succeeded at passing major reform when they’ve been in charge, and no compromise has been reached when it’s been split. 4/4
All while the southern border is considered the safest and hardest to cross it has ever been, according to DHS: https://t.co/WsuQZ86ox0 and while the immigration courts are legitimately hopelessly backlogged but approps for immigration judges has lagged ICE funding 3/

In announcing 5,200 troops to the border, officials said nothing changes for now for people who show up “lawfully” - i.e. at a legal crossing and claiming asylum. But that’s just for now.	“We also are considering all potential options,” CBP’s McAleenan says.
Troops will assist with things like engineering, hardening the border, air support, medical support, for now

Air Force Gen. Terrence J. O’Shaughnessy: “By the end of this week, we will deploy over 5,200 soldiers to the southwest border. That is just the start of this operation.”	That’s in addition to 2,000 Guard troops already there.

And it’s over — KDL’s most direct attack on Feinstein was a “senior senator” reference on her Iraq War vote.
De León’s closing pitch: “I’m running in 2018 to give you a new voice, a new approach, and change. This is a different California than it was 25 years ago.”
@doug_rand You've had a lot more spare time today than I have had thus far...
De León :“I wish Democrats in Washington would fight like hell for Dreamers just like President Trump and Republicans fight like hell for their stupid wall.”
KDL makes a direct reference at a Feinstein vote — to go to war in Iraq. But slips it in subtly as “our senior senator’s vote."
Feinstein brings up Khashoggi, says consulates should be places where people are safe. “You don’t go into a consulate and get killed by staff in that consulate.”	Calls for an investigation.
Feinstein goes on offense on water issues, interjects a “Kevin” into her answer about writing water legislation.
And then piles on Feinstein’s answer: “I don’t believe in a public option.” Says Washington can find the money for more.
KDL goes there:  “I believe that health care is a human right. I believe in Medicare for all, not Medicare for some.”	First time I’ve heard a clear progressive-moderate split thus far.
Feinstein: “I believe in universal health care. The question is how we get it.”

De León says he would support re-visiting the Kavanaugh allegations if elected, an idea Pelosi somewhat dismissed in a sitdown with us last week: https://t.co/J3JnxagAJE
KDL-Feinstein embody the Washington-state divide. Feinstein cites her seniority on Senate Judiciary when asked about immigration. KDL cites a “lack of action in Washington” and goes for the emotional ICE “hunted our mothers and fathers” language.
De Leon lists his top priorities as health care, immigration and climate change. Feinstein kicks off with a message of economic growth.

Sessions re: Trump’s latest comments about him: “The President speaks his mind, he says what’s on his mind at the time.”	Says Trump “frustrated” about recusal, but Sessions/DOJ “pleased and honored” to execute his agenda.

In the meantime, just in is latest on family reunifications.	Key numbers this week:	-45 kids out of gov’t custody since last week, 17 of whom to parents vs 28 to others	-174 families so far where parent was deported who decline to be reunited, giving kid a chance to stay in US https://t.co/keBoVfMZbv
“The witnesses who were there say it didn’t happen.”
A reminder, as another Republican apologizes to Kavanaugh for this process, that not a single one opted to use any of their question time to speak in the presence of Ford.
Every time lawmakers ask about his drinking or party habits, Kavanaugh points to the fact that he was a good student and athlete.
It’s undeniable that Lindsey Graham completely redirected the tenor of this hearing
“I think Dr. Ford is a victim, and I think she’s been through hell,” Sasse says. 	He declined his opportunity to ask her questions or say anything to her, deferring instead to the now-sidelined prosecutor they brought in.

I guess Republicans are done with having their outside counsel conduct their questions. Third since Graham broke the dam.	Grassley had said Mitchell’s role was to keep the process from getting political
Kavanaugh begins by apologizing for throwing Klobuchar’s question back at her before the break
Feels like the two parts of today have been geared toward different audiences https://t.co/F5nKeyvvWB
Kavanaugh has turned questions back onto the senators more than once now
After multiple rounds, I think it’s clear that Kavanaugh will not be asking for an FBI investigation
“Stormy Daniels' lawyer"
“My life is totally and permanently altered,” Kavanaugh says.
“That refers to flatulence; we were 16” re: boof
“I’m known to have a weak stomach, I always have,” Kavanaugh says, responding to “Ralph club” in yearbook	“I’ve got a weak stomach, whether it’s with beer, or spicy food, or anything."
“If you’re worried about my yearbook, have at it, Senator."
This is the first Republican to use their questioning time in either part of the hearing
I’d welcome anything this committee decides, Kavanaugh keeps saying.	In Congress, committees are controlled by the majority party, which is currently the GOP.
Leahy: “Are you Bart O’Kavanaugh?” 	Kavanaugh: “You’d have to ask him.”	Leahy: "I agree with you."
Leahy asks Kavanaugh if he’s Bart O’Kavanaugh in Mark Judge’s book.	Kavanaugh says Judge had a very difficult drinking problem and it was “fictionalized”	“We can sit here and make fun of some guy that has an addiction…"
Again, Kavanaugh not answering a Dem’s questions about whether Kavanaugh wants more investigation: 	“It was dropped on me, it was sprung,” he says, interrupting Leahy
If anyone tells you this testimony is “working” or “not working,” the question is for what?	For the swing Senate votes?	For Trump?	For Kavanaugh’s personal integrity?	For the GOP?	For the broader Me Too movement?	There are a lot of different issues colliding here.
The question was whether anyone ever recounted something to him he does not recall happening while drinking https://t.co/RhJuADEIqA
“Passed out, no, I’ve gone to sleep, I’ve never blacked out” — Kavanaugh, asked if he’s ever passed out from drinking
Kavanaugh: “The Swetnick thing is a joke, it’s a farce”	Feinstein: Would you like to say more about it?	Kavanaugh: "No"
Feinstein has asked him multiple times why he hasn’t called for an FBI investigation.	Kavanaugh has responded multiple times he’ll do whatever the committee wants, and it’s an “outrage” he wasn’t testifying the day after it broke
Mitchell also questioning Kavanaugh
Once again, Kavanaugh blames Dems for what they’ve “unleashed” against him
“For one thing, our yearbook was a disaster” — Kavanaugh
“I liked beer. I still like beer.” — Kavanaugh	(Adds he never drank it "to the point of blacking out”)
In our criminal justice system, this type of competing testimony is resolved by the deliberation of a 12-member jury of our peers. 	Not sure who is the “jury” in this case. Maybe senators, maybe voters, maybe all of the above.
RT @sarahdwire: Here is Kavanaugh's prepared statement. https://t.co/rFEbv1vJm0		This is nothing like his prepared statement.
This is from Clarence Thomas’ in his nomination hearing, h/t @MarshallCohen 	https://t.co/SKXCuLkavs https://t.co/8UVus5yw22
Choking up, crying, Kavanaugh says his 10-year-old said to his other daughter the other night that they should “pray for the woman"
Kavanaugh says he’s not “questioning” that Ford was assaulted “by someone at some place at some time” but not him
“I’ve never sexually assaulted anyone … sexual assault is horrific” 	“Allegations of sexual assault must always be taken seriously … at the same time, the person who is is the subject of the allegations also deserves to be heard."	— Kavanaugh
“I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process” — Kavanaugh
“I fear for the future” — Kavanaugh (after prefacing that he’s actually an optimistic man)
“grotesque and coordinated character assassination” … “what goes around, comes around" — Kavanaugh
“This has destroyed my family and good name, a good name built through decades (of service)” - Kavanaugh
Kavanaugh showing his raw frustration and not holding back in attacking over “smears,” “crazy stuff” alleged against him

Concepts being applied selectively based on political leanings today:	-Credibility of sworn statements to Congress b/c of penalty of felony	-What the standard is for “corroboration” 	-What standard is for “proof"
Every time a lawmaker today accuses the other side of politicizing this: 🙄
“It was not a remarkable evening … nothing remarkable happened to them” — Ford (on why others may not remember the gathering)
Harris is phrasing this as comments to Ford, but this seems to be constructed as more of a closing arg to her colleagues
RT @jmsummers: .@SenKamalaHarris to Blasey Ford: "You are not on trial."
“I wish I could be more helpful” - Ford, when teed up with a very political/procedure-oriented question
I’m really curious how Mitchell’s role in this process was described/directed to her.
Hirono asks Grassley if it’s appropriate for each Republican senator to not individually cede their questions to the prosecutor, with Grassley doing it in their place.	Grassley simply says: Yes
Wow https://t.co/zZO5kmsMjk
Well it’s not a trial, but we do now have an objection
Keep in mind that there are no requirements to be a Supreme Court justice, nor on whether one should be confirmed. The process is designed so that each and every senator can make his/her own decision about what does or does not qualify.
RT @AshleyRParker: There is something so incongruous about this whole scene: Gripping, emotional testimony from Dr. Ford, punctuated by par…
There are so many layers bumping with each other right now:	-The political consequences electorally	-The lobbying among senators to try to influence a Supreme Court nom vote	-The pure, raw, human emotion on display	-A broader conversation about women’s rights and sexual assault
Ford says the most indelible memory is “the uproarious laughter between the two and their having fun at my expense,” as her voice cracks.	“Two friends having a really good time with one another."
Putting aside everything else about this hearing for the moment, this is a window at least partially into what it’s like to testify about a sexual assault in a courtroom
Feinstein: What you are telling us is this could not be a case of mistaken identity?	Ford: "Absolutely not"
Ford says as she struggled with whether to come forward, she worried she’d be jumping in front of a train headed where it was headed no matter what and she would be “annihilated” in the process

There’s been a lot written about immigrants and benefits with the Trump admin’s new rule proposal.	But the way the it’s written, you could be rejected even if you don’t use benefits, if the gov’t decides you’re likely to “any time in the future.”	More: https://t.co/W6LqJcm9XC
Previously, immigrants could be rejected from the US if they were “primarily dependent” on govt, meaning 50% of their income was from govt. 	The Trump admin wants to define it as receiving or likely to receive &gt;$150 a month.	https://t.co/W6LqJcm9XC
What is the "public charge” rule that the Trump admin proposed?	It would give the US broad latitude to reject immigrants if they have too little income and education, effectively creating a "merit-based" immigration system without an act of Congress. 	https://t.co/W6LqJcm9XC
