On Sunday, Saudi Arabia ruled out extraditing suspects in the murder to Turkey, with the country's Foreign Minister Adel al Jubeir saying, "We don't extradite our citizens."
Fahrettin Altun said the world should seek justice for his case "under international law."
Earlier on Monday, Turkey's presidential communications director said, "Saudi Arabia's refusal to extradite the suspected killers of Khashoggi is very disappointing."
Riyadh's refusal to extradite suspects 'disappointing'
He said Turkey is also planning to appeal to the UN to initiate the process, along with some other global leaders, including the Canadian prime minister.
Cavusoglu said the UN will be discussing international probe into Riyadh critic's murder at the Security Council.
"Earlier the head of a commission and two investigators from Geneva called for an international probe. We've discussed the issue with the UN general secretary and the human rights commission chief."
Cavusoglu said several foreign ministers at the recent G20 summit also agreed to jointly call for an international probe into the killing.
Global leaders interested in international probe
After initially saying he had left the consulate alive, Saudi Arabia admitted weeks later that he was killed there, blaming his death on a group of rogue Saudi operatives.		Following a royal decree, Riyadh dismissed five senior officials.
Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist, and columnist for The Washington Post, went missing after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in early October.
"Demands for an international investigation have started coming, we are continuing talks with the UN on this," Cavusoglu said, speaking at a news conference in Ankara.
Last week, UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said an international investigation was needed to determine who was responsible for the murder of Khashoggi, who was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2.
Turkey is in talks with the United Nations regarding an investigation into the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Tuesday.
Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu says Ankara continues to talk with UN for international probe into Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi's killing.

However, speaking to reporters after the meeting, Jeffrey said that the U.S. military posts near Turkish border in northern Syria aim at "less harassment fire" and ensuring security of the region including Turkey.
... which Turkey sees an offshoot of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
For his part, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar on Friday called on the United States to lift military observation posts in northern Syria, and urged Jeffrey in their meeting to end the U.S. collaboration with the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), ...
"Throughout, they discussed issues facing the Syrian diaspora and the necessity for a Syrian-led and -owned political process under U.N. Security Council resolution 2254," the statement added.
... Turkish military officials the importance of the unique military cooperation between the United States and Turkey in resolving the conflict in Syria."
Jeffrey and Rayburn also "visited the site of U.S. and Turkish military rehearsals for joint patrols in fulfillment of the Manbij roadmap and discussed with U.S. and ...
According to a statement, Jeffrey, together with Joel Rayburn, U.S. deputy assistant secretary, visited Turkey's Gaziantep on Dec. 8 to meet with U.S. and Turkish military officials, Syrian refugees, civil society actors, and political groups working on Syria.
U.S. State Department said on Monday that the special representative for Syria engagement, James Jeffrey, recently visited the rehearsal site of U.S.-Turkey joint patrols and highlighted the role of bilateral military cooperation.
President Trump’s administration hopes that the U.S.-backed fight against Islamic State in its last foothold in northeastern Syria will end within months. But a top U.S. diplomat recently said American forces will remain to ensure the “enduring defeat” of the militant group.
Islamic State is still present in eastern Syria in a pocket east of the Euphrates River near the border with Iraq.
“We expect our U.S. allies to immediately cut their ties with the terrorist YPG, who are not in the slightest bit different from the PKK,” Akar added.
“Nobody should doubt that the Turkish Armed forces and the Republic of Turkey will take the necessary steps against all kinds of risks and threats from across its borders,” he said.
Turkey is angry at U.S. support for the YPG, which it views as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) waging a decades-long insurgency on Turkish soil. The PKK is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union.
“During our talks with both political and civilian interlocutors we repeatedly expressed our unease in various ways,” he said. “I think actions like this will make the complicated situation in the region even more complicated”.
Akar said he told U.S. Chief of Staff Joseph Dunford and other U.S. officials during a recent visit to Canada that setting up the posts would have a very negative impact on perceptions of the United States in Turkey.
The United States has long complained that tension between Turkey and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) - which includes the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia - has at times slowed progress on the fight against Islamic State.
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Wednesday the United States was setting up the posts to help keep the focus on clearing the final Islamic State militant strongholds in Syria.
Turkey is uneasy about U.S. plans to set up “observation posts” in Syria along parts of its border with Turkey, Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said on Saturday.

"We take Turkish security concerns seriously and we are committed to coordinating our efforts with Turkey to bring stability to northeastern Syria," Manning said in the release.
Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar explained that it could lead to a perception that the United States is "somehow protecting terrorist YPG [Kurdish People's Protection Units] members."
Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar has earlier said Ankara expressed its concerns about US plans to establish several observation posts in Syria.
"At the direction of Secretary Mattis, the US established observation posts in the northeast Syria border region to address the security concerns of our NATO ally Turkey," the release said on Tuesday.
The United States has finalized the establishment of observation posts in northeast Syria and will be coordinating with Turkey its security efforts in the border region, Department of Defence spokesperson Col. Rob Manning said in a press release.
