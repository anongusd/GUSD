@SweetPauly14 @amyklobuchar I am a tax preparer and that is not true. Trump‚Äôs tax plan eliminated a lot of deductions which basically resulted in a tax increase for a large number of middle class folks.
@StanleysanSmith @Mlf127 @amyklobuchar I am a tax preparer and it all depends on the income, # of kids and other dependents- I have seen a handful of clients do better - but majority got worse outcomes mainly due to loss of $4050 deduction for each person on return, loss of work expense deduction and under withholding
