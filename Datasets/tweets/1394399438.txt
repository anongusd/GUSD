Key info: https://t.co/Ioa23GcdeO We’re excited for 2019 &amp; #WeWontStop! https://t.co/4U9oJzQFB7
.@TMobile will be the first &amp; ONLY ones to bring the 5G revolution to everyone, everywhere – not just in a few dense, urban areas (👀 at you @Verizon). We’re building a real nationwide 5G network for EVERYONE!
Oh, and did I mention @TMobile’s 4G LTE network continues to kick ass as the fastest in the nation for 5 years running? 20 Qs in a row with the fastest upload &amp; download speeds https://t.co/P47cFQ08Va
.@NevilleRay and team also continue building toward the FIRST REAL NATIONWIDE 5G NETWORK using our 600 MHz spectrum. We’re now in more than 2,700 cities and towns in 43 states and Puerto Rico!! INCREDIBLE!! #WeWontStop https://t.co/pM1FgqqcTP
Our $TMUS customer growth = @TMobile and @MetroByTMobile investments in new areas, under-penetrated segments &amp; even more expansion of the incredible customer care teams across the country. #TeamOfExperts https://t.co/Ik3wkMzdEb
That means we’ve now had 23 straight Qs of adding more than 1M customers! AND churn fell 19 bps YoY, which means customers are flocking to us and STAYING!! Oh, &amp; these stats… 	https://t.co/6H1UORr335
We already shared our BEST CUSTOMER RESULTS EVER in Q4, but let’s recap ;)  		🔥2.4M total net additions…best Q EVER!  	🔥1.4M postpaid net additions…best Q4 EVER!  	🔥1M postpaid 📱 net adds…best in 16 Qs!  	🔥0.99% postpaid 📱 churn…LOWEST Q4 EVER! https://t.co/147i6fSrO4
Did I mention we also led the industry in YoY% growth in serv rev (19 Q’s in a row!) &amp; total rev? BECAUSE WE DID. That combined w/ our strong net income of $640M in Q4 &amp; $2.9B FY, &amp; our record high adj. EBITDA $3.0B in Q4 &amp; $12.4B FY, made 2018 ANOTHER RECORD YEAR – it’s amazing! https://t.co/rwvazXmqqA
Let’s talk $TMUS financials...because we had RECORD HIGH TOTAL AND SERVICE REVENUES in both Q4 and FY 2018!  		🔥 $8.2B serv. rev. in Q4 – up 6% YoY  😱 	🔥 $32.0B serv. rev. FY – up 6% YoY  😱 	🔥 $11.4B in total rev. in Q4 – up 6% YoY  😱 	🔥 $43.3B total rev. FY – up 7% YoY 😱 https://t.co/wncv20IkqR
2018 was ANOTHER record year for @TMobile - full of best-ever financials, best-ever (and accelerated) customer growth, record-low postpaid phone churn, record total and service revenues, strong net income, record Q4 adj. EBITDA &amp; so.much.more!! 😎 https://t.co/PbaZ8eiG3W

Looks like we have a really BS-filled encore from @Charter…I think they should title it “Yikes!” They burned -$304M in free cash flow and -$122M in adj. EBITDA just trying to gain new mobile customers! That’s more expensive than a 🎟 to #CarrierPalooza!

Don’t worry, everyone - @TMobile will create REAL 5G to finally give ppl a better &amp; cheaper alternative! Just wait until they have actual broadband competition!
Charter added broadband customers but maybe it’s because those poor customers had no other choice?! Charters next hit should be “Charter Fights Off An Angry Mob” because that’s what’s gonna happen 🤣
Nice work, Charter! They must be panicking – another Q of losing video customers! That’s 296K residential video customers out the door in 2018, but still so focused on getting mobile customers. News flash: nobody wants to get overcharged by another crappy company. https://t.co/zT4suRANq4
Hope Charter learns how to treat mobile customers better than they treat their current customers now! Big Cable should follow @TMobile’s lead if they are really going to play in mobile. Remember, we’re happy to give you a 101 on #TeamOfExperts!
Did Charter learn NOTHING from @Comcast?! That was one expensive Q! Spending $211M to get only 113K mobile customers. Clearly Big Cable is going to spend big to get into mobile &amp; they have the deep pockets to do it! https://t.co/vFPRe23j8c
It’s the FINAL day of #CarrierPalooza and the day that Charter can finally shine… or not! 🤣 What kind of BS are they spitting now? Definitely expecting “Money For Nothing” &amp; “Charter Likes to Be Greedy” to make an appearance. https://t.co/nsQSDBOCT9

At least they have 5G eeeeee to keep them going… JK! Customers aren’t falling for that BS! Slapping “5Ge” on a 4G LTE phone is like charging people for a private jet experience and actually giving them a school bus ride. https://t.co/TfLzXEaKrr
There are some real nerves coming from the #DeaTThstar green room for their expected “Money Year” … guess those 1.8M DTV defections since Q2 17 are taking a toll! They’ve got $49B problems and new customers ain’t one! https://t.co/f06tka8gQF
#DeATThStar continues to call themselves a “Modern Media Company.” What does it take to be a “Modern Media Company”? Apparently -403K satellite custs, -267K DTVNow custs, -32K broadband custs. Oh.. and a media business with EBITDA declining 16% YoY. https://t.co/3U1JVzj7cJ
AT&amp;T lost 107K postpaid customers and postpaid phone churn up 11 bps YoY! That’s ~4.4M postpaid phones lost in ~4 yrs (17Q’s)… (same time $TMUS added 13.8M and lowered churn 19 bps YoY)! That tune is called “Nobody Likes Us” https://t.co/eWvhTAeKlI
What.A.Performance!! Just when you think #CarrierPalooza can’t get any worse… it does! Poor #DeATThStar was caught lip syncing! No wonder they didn’t pre-release!

@luanne_martel https://t.co/JLglg70jcd
@plewis1956 What’s wrong with that??
@edielmr3 Never!! Bring it!!
@jimcramer @SquawkStreet Like a pelican?? 😂
@lowej017 https://t.co/X9v728FON7
@ashhhlyn23 🙌🏻
🎼 The show kept going for VerLIEzon – lots of issues on wireline biz… revenue is down by 3.5% and EBITDA is down by 22%. Fios is the Nickelback of #Carrierpolooza! They lost 46K video customers and have a 8 Q losing streak with ~250k customers out the door! #showover
🎼 Looks like “The Artist Formerly Known As Oath” has made an appearance too! 😂 Verizon is hard at work cleaning up the Oath mess!! They took a $4.6B write down this Q. OUCH! Maybe they’ll start “Oh90: A Go90 Tribute Band!” https://t.co/1nnbvYmCP3
🎼 Here’s my favorite tune: T-Mobile has had the fastest network for 5 straight years (that’s 20 Q’s!) and when we bring 5G, it will be the real thing!
🎼 Let’s not forget a key part of #CarrierPalooza… #VerLIEzon continuing to hype their made-in-a-garage “5G” band (aka making up their own standards) named “The 8 Currencies of 5G”…It’s VerLIEzon’s version of promising luxury tents and delivering plastic-wrapped mattresses…
🎼 My favorite song VerLIEzon played was called “I want to get away,” because postpaid phone churn is up 5 bps YoY while $TMUS is down 19bps YoY! Where are all those customers going? ;)
🎼 Day 1 of #CarrierPalooza is ON! First up: #VerLIEzon! I guess they only preannounced the good numbers… That’s the 20th consecutive quarter where $TMUS BEAT Verizon in postpaid 📱 nets! AND they lost 90k prepaid customers this Q…757k of the base FY! Music to my ears. https://t.co/A8hyHs4OVr
@Themommaforeezy https://t.co/544RHV9jB9
@kayegoldstein88 @TMobile Love it!
@Q5V7Z3 @TMobile @panerabread @MsChristinaZ What are you gonna get?!
It’s almost time for VerLIEzon to take the stage!! What will they play first?? https://t.co/w5Am6FVDUK
@TacomaJustin can't unsee 😹
@MelinaFranco5 @TMobile https://t.co/zOa7LhBR9t
@InmanAlex Wow! This is amazing!
@tinajero_rigo 😂 Amazing!
Guess we’ll just have to tune in tomorrow to find out! Let’s cross our fingers that “The Overpriced Network” makes an appearance 😂
Tomorrow, we all see @Verizon... sorry, “VerLIEzon” perform! Hopefully they play their hit record, “The 8 Currencies of 5G” or their other one, “Don’t Call us Oath Anymore”? https://t.co/AWvSfB790S
Introducing #CarrierPalooza: a 3-day earnings festival featuring the ever-horrible headliners: the #DeATThStar, #VerLIEzon &amp; Charter. It’s a festival full of failed 5G promises, poor customer service &amp; overpriced EVERYTHING. Sounds like a blast, right?! https://t.co/EuqxwHVY80
Last week I got an idea after @Comcast’s earnings results... There are 3 days of earnings coming up. @Verizon, @ATT and then Charter – back to back... so why not make this a big event we can invite people to?? Kinda like #FyreFestival.

They missed consensus on broadband – not great for @comcast!! Can you imagine what these numbers will look like once REAL 5G arrives? Customers are hungry for broadband choices – and we will bring them!
Look at that! @Comcast has a losing streak underway - 7Qs in-a-row of video customer losses (wait, when did they start Xfinity Mobile?). I wonder what those 563k customers cutting the Comcast cord are watching now? Hint: 📱
Yikes! @comcast results are in –$191M hit to EBITDA to get 227k mobile customers?? You do the math… 😉 They’ll spend whatever it takes, and they can. Here’s a live shot of them spending to get mobile customers: https://t.co/5MGpDLrgud

It’s #RuffFriday - the day of the week when I highlight a deserving pup from @SeattleHumane who needs a home!! Meet Bubba. He loves to play tug-o-war and will be your best pal after some belly rubs. Go meet him today!🐶 #NoLegereDogYet https://t.co/cYpMfspM02
@washingtonpost As I said that day, my leaders &amp; I stay in many different hotels in DC. The process to get our merger approved is important and rigorous - and we respect it. We will continue to go through that process and I don’t expect a hotel stay to have any influence on regulatory decisions.
Wow - A lot of attention on where I choose to stay in DC. I’ve said many times that I respect this process and am working to get our merger done the right way. I trust regulators will make their decision based on the benefits it will bring to the US, not based on hotel choices.

5/ And @verizon isn’t innocent in all this 5G puffery. They’re up on a soap box right now saying they’d “never do what @att is doing,” but from where I stand they’re doing the same thing… https://t.co/t8xonk25aa
4/ This isn’t just bad marketing by @att, it’s a FLAT OUT LIE. It’s intended to confuse customers and make themselves look “advanced.” This is EXACTLY why we became the #Uncarrier – to undo all the carrier BS and take care of customers.
3/ @ATT’s “5G e” is nothing more than LTE-A … and guess what, @TMobile has more LTE-A than they do!! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2/ @ATT should be ashamed of themselves! Slapping “5G e” on something that is actually LTE is like putting an extra 0 on a $10 bill and calling it $100 bill!! #GoodLuckUsingIt
1/ I’ve been calling BS on all the 5G fiction that @ATT and @Verizon are spewing since Day 1‼️ https://t.co/6KFMilQKcq
Well, it’s time to call Bullsh*t on the industry again… and I think you know what it’s about. Here it comes @att and @verizon. https://t.co/NyvNlHecHg

@OffendedBadger 😂😂😂
The only 5G that @ATT has is in the form of a massive puck that customers can’t even buy yet! Oh, and they refuse to publish a “5G E” coverage map with it… 5G E might as well stand for 5G “empty,” because that’s all it is. https://t.co/Q1phtib1Wv
But misleading customers is in the #DeATThStar’s genes…they can’t help it! Just because they can put the logo on people’s phones, doesn’t mean they should… 🙄 https://t.co/X7qErZtje4
I couldn’t have said it better myself! Does @ATT really think that customers would fall for their mountain of “5G E” BS?! Their “5G E” is just LTE-A and guess what?! @TMobile has WAY more than they do 😂 https://t.co/N0ZZasCdrZ

🏆 The Cableopoly came in DEAD LAST in this year’s customer satisfaction report... an even lower rating than last year! We launched #TeamofExperts 👫 and eliminated bots, bouncing and BS to pave the way for the rest of wireless!		Might be time to Un-cable the cable industry… 🤔 https://t.co/rAsOFoJDot
@SievertMike Me? Never. 😏
RT @Trayc2084: @JohnLegere I switched to @TMobile a few months ago and I have to say that my faith in wireless companies has been renewed!…
🏆 @verizon launched that feel-good Super Bowl ad focused on emergency responders... then infamously throttled their data 🙃 @TMobile gave $8.5M in 2018 to support youth, disaster recovery, environment, vets &amp; more. Oh, and net proceeds from my cookbook go to Feeding America ❤ https://t.co/El6C2wUgiZ
🏆 @ATT raised rates on grandfathered unlimited plans for the THIRD time! All the biz customers that fled their network are enjoying @TMobileBusiness 😎 whose customers have been named most satisfied in wireless for two straight years by @JDPower 😉 https://t.co/DSsExDrfGN
🏆 Yay! Dual winners! @Verizon got cute &amp; created their own 5G* standards... @ATT’s idea of 5G is basically LTE. Our proposed merger with @Sprint will supercharge the #Uncarrier, create REAL broad and deep nationwide MOBILE 5G, create 🇺🇸 jobs and increase global competitiveness! https://t.co/Dv8jUKL09M
@Ant20k @verizon @ATT https://t.co/TQwHfDUWB9
@XxBTStephhxX @ATT @TMobile Come back!
@505Will @TMobile the best gift!
🏆 Another list topped by @Verizon – you’ve got the most congested network in wireless at 57% capacity! Congrats!! So proud of you 😘 (BTW, @TMobile is least congested at 28%... and our 600 MHz ecosystem is growing, live in 1,500+ cities... and we have 27 devices that support it) https://t.co/u15wKWNWCf
@tdreed00 Every hour on the hour!
🏆 Glassdoor calls @dish one of worst companies to work for with a 2.6 rating. Meanwhile, @TMobile topped 'great place to work' lists 30+ times this year, including Forbes, Fortune, Glassdoor &amp; more. And listed as a top employer for women, Hispanics, diversity, LGBTQ...nbd 😉 https://t.co/ZlcIz0hClD

🏆 Congrats @Verizon for committing to 50% clean energy by 2025, you are literally half-assing it. We said we’d donate $1.5M to the Nature Conservancy if you and @ATT joined us in our commitment to 100% renewable energy by 2021, but no worries. We still donated more than $700k 😉 https://t.co/I3W0nmYJNZ

@MurdocksGirl @SaschaIllyvich @ATT @KIESERSOZE @TMobile Rhetorical question. Of course the #Uncarrier provides service in the Batcave 🙄
@SaschaIllyvich @ATT #IamBatman https://t.co/2vbsVxysfG
@bales_bustin @ATT Make the switch Justin!
It might be bigger than Santa’s bag full of toys but who cares? It has 8 built-in fans for puck cooling!! Check out the AWESOME Puck Pack Chiller 🙌🏼 #WhatThePuck		*Results may vary, only available in small pockets of a few cities, per @ATT https://t.co/fzPjD6f2VB
Out of sight. Out of mind. Putting “mobile” 5G on your head is just smart… Pick up the Headgear of the Year for all those hat enthusiasts in your life 🤠 #WhatThePuck		*Results may vary, only available in small pockets of a few cities, per @ATT https://t.co/kG73vA28ML
1990s @TheRock isn’t the only one to make a large fanny pack look good 🤣 Gift the Fancy-ish Fanny Pack for that special someone who always accessorizes 😎		*Results may vary, only available in small pockets of a few cities, per @ATT https://t.co/ta2fScKPRU
Don’t let your “mobile” 5G throw you off balance or puck up your gains 💪🏼 Get the Couture Counterweight to keep things level! #WhatThePuck		*Results may vary, only available in small pockets of a few cities, per @ATT https://t.co/8eABhLNjzf
Next, for the travelers out there… since your @ATT 5G is “mobile” and all, you’re gonna need something with wheels and a handle 😉 Introducing, the Puck Truck! #WhatThePuck		*Results may vary, only available in small pockets of a few cities, per @ATT https://t.co/0dwNaT72a0
Let’s kick things off with the Heat Absorbing Mitt! Custom built to cool down your excessively large puck 😁 #WhatThePuck		*Results may vary, only available in small pockets of a few cities, per @ATT https://t.co/Y9XYThJd48
However they decide to disguise their “5G” network, disguising the MASSIVE puck @ATT customers are required to lug around won’t be so easy… So, in the holiday spirit, we decided to help them out with a Holiday Gift Guide for the puck! 😉 #WhatThePuck https://t.co/GJJVZJZphs
So @ATT is only making their "mobile 5G" available in a few parts of a few cities, while ignoring the rest of the country?! Wait, I meant to say 5Ge... or was it 5G+?? 🤔 Can't keep up with the alternatives for REAL 5G...

@PumpknSpiceSoul Not a shocker 😏
Oh, and feel free to use this as part of your vision board 😊 https://t.co/RyHansbHXb
If your kid cleaned up half of their room, you would say “good start – now go do the rest.” So, @Verizon…..GO DO THE REST!!!
In fact (pulls out calculator) 50 percent is half of 100 percent 🧐 That’s mathematically, and literally, half-assed!
When @TMobile launched #CleanUpWireless, we challenged the #Duopoly to clean up their act and go 100 PERCENT clean. Clearly they got confused and thought 50 percent each would count as 100 percent 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
So, @Verizon has decided to make 50 percent of its energy from clean sources. That’s great!! I am very proud of you 👏🏻👏🏻 But wait… only 50 percent!?!? Okay, nevermind, I’m only half proud of you.

@12thCenturyFox @VinnyVinesauce When seeing the people all happy and free, @Verizon said, "We can't let this be!		"We know what to do!" Verizon did say, "we'll wrap them in fees and restrictions instead! And tiny small print with tape that is red."

It’s been almost 3 years since I started slow cooking every Sunday and filming it live on Facebook… who knew millions of people would join in to watch each week? It’s been a whirlwind… which is why it’s surreal to announce… My Cookbook! IN!!
RT @NevilleRay: Our network team added lowband LTE to dozens of sites in just two weeks, which means more and better coverage. And #WeWontS…
