@BishopJakes Bishop, as a person that has been affiliated with your ministry since the late 90's I can truly say your teaching and preaching remains relative. Thank you for your sacrifice to be used of God. So much of who I am today is because of your preaching. Thank you.
@MariahCarey In spite of your own worries and trials you keep finding ways to reinvent and remain relative to your audience. Proud of you! Pass that on to your children.  True genius.
