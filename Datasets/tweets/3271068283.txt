Ag research allows farmers to apply cutting edge science &amp; tech in their operations to improve productivity &amp; efficiency says @Rocktalking
For US to maintain global scientific prominence we must continue to invest in research says @Rocktalking
.@Rocktalking says FFAR's unique model builds public-private partnerships to leverage fed funding w/ matching funds for ag research
.@SenStabenow believes in science-based solutions. Agriculture research is good for our farmers, consumers and economy.
The US will lose its global competitiveness without support for #farmers through agriculture #research says @SenStabenow
