Dems are raising pressure on Labor Sec Alex Acosta over the cushy deal he cut w/a suspected child sex-trafficker. Acosta's bigger prob? Republicans &amp; biz lobbyists are also down on him. His only ally appears to be Trump--an acquaintance of the accused. https://t.co/DCdFkXOoeh
@CrabOfDoom Could be, though I've seen no evidence of that yet.
BTW, I think the author of the Power Line post is right in his political calculations: Not clear why Dems would want Acosta out. He's been as mild as they cld expect from a Trump appointee in reversing Obama regs. And now he has the potential to weigh Trump down w/more scandal.
Heres' the beginning of that Powerline post. It gets worse from there... https://t.co/67OWCPcs1D

The fight over Amazon's New York HQ may have been the key battle for leverage between workers and big tech over the next decade or two. And workers may have won it. https://t.co/dJQTtMkBYz

The verbal tic "right"--as in, I'm explaining something perfectly obvious, but I stop every few sentences to ask if you're getting it--who do I blame for this? Millennials? The British? Venture capitalist podcasts? Seems like it exploded in the last 2-3 yrs. It's maddening.
I don't think Amazon can credibly threaten to stay out of New York if the political leadership insists they tone down their opposition to unions. And in fact, they made clear when canceling their HQ that they'll continue to expand their NYC footprint.
What makes me think unions may have the advantage is that Amazon will probably have to significantly expand its presence in the NYC area, and other liberal enclaves, over the next decade. The markets are just too big and important.
And unions were willing to be blamed for depriving NYC of 25,000 jobs and billions in future tax revenue to be able to credibly say going forward that if you want to do business in New York, you can't be hostile to organizing.
What's interesting is that both sides were willing to pay a steep short-term price to win long-term leverage. Amazon endured the embarrassment and loss of face of canceling its NYC HQ to credibly say going forward that it would resist efforts to organize its workers.
Years from now we'll look back on the Amazon fight in NYC as the key battle for leverage between Amazon and workers. The only catch is, we don't know who won yet. But here's why it may have been workers. https://t.co/dJQTtMkBYz https://t.co/EAy9PEbLwb

@accretivegrowth @WillOremus i know this because it's almost always the case. see here: https://t.co/6KtdV726JM and that's if you're making something completely banal like plates or wheels. for a whole completely new product, there is no way for it not to be a costly nightmare at the outset.
@accretivegrowth @WillOremus and those headaches would have massively eaten into the wage advantage that China had and made the calculation much closer to a wash. but by that point their solution was to throw more money at the problem to fix it. offshoring is massively path dependent.
@accretivegrowth @WillOremus Some middlemen almost certainly sold them a narrative about how it would be puppies and rainbows. and i'd guess that for the first few years it was a disastrous ordeal as they figured out who could build this stuff and oversee it and procure parts and deliver them on time.
@accretivegrowth @WillOremus I was referring to the past 20 years. I would contend that even with the existing supply chain, and even (especially?) at small scale, it was not much more cost-effective to build the early iPods and iPhones there.
@accretivegrowth @WillOremus there were a series of very fateful decisions by US companies to invest a ridiculous amount of money relocating a supply chain from the US to China.
@accretivegrowth @WillOremus it cost trillions of dollars over the decades to put that supply chain in China and make it function.
@accretivegrowth @WillOremus now obviously, there was a growing electronics manufacturing industry and supply chain there. but that was also the result of other companies spending 100s of billions of dollars to build it up. when the first movers first moved, it was not a very big money saver.
@accretivegrowth @WillOremus they had iPhone and MacBook part suppliers and factories in China in the 1990s that Apple just plugged into? they spent tens of not 100s of billions of dollars building that stuff.
@accretivegrowth @WillOremus yes, they had no choice. no one had a choice. history/adam smith told everyone they had to move offshore to china, where they had to create a new supply chain from scratch, and quality and productivity were really crappy for years if not decades until they ironed out the kinks.
@SantoriniDave @KYWeise Uh, yes? Working at Apple making MacBooks and iPhones would be infinitely more desirable and higher-paying in the US than working at the Gap or Chipotle. You're aware that there are tens of millions of American adults who didn't go to college right?
@SantoriniDave @KYWeise And they shouldn't buy Apple's nonsense about why it's not possible to produce these products in the US. It's only not possible because they gutted the supply chain that previously made it possible.
@SantoriniDave @KYWeise Apple can do whatever it wants and feel whatever it wants. But Americans are right to be upset that they could have good jobs they don't have because Apple has offshored manufacturing. Ditto the US government.

Apple comparing the ease/difficulty of manufacturing in the US to ease of manufacturing in China is asinine. They've had 2 decades to build up suppliers, expertise there. If China had been held to the same standard when Apple moved there 15-20 yrs ago, they would have never moved
When you spend two decades manufacturing your products in China, you put all your US suppliers out of business. They can't magically reappear in a few months if you suddenly feel guilty about offshoring jobs and pretend to give it another go in the US.
I would take Apple's complaints about how hard it is to manufacture products in the US a lot more seriously if they hadn't been a major force in the gutting of the US supply chain by shipping manufacturing to China over the past two decades. https://t.co/lZBJsV3dfK

Yes, this seems like the more plausible scenario https://t.co/7t1Santg6A
@R0vil Good point.
The big risk is that the discussion leaks and gets back to Trump. OTOH, McConnell is a fundamentally rational person who understands his political interests &amp; where they diverge from Trump's. I guess I can imagine some back-channel that gives McConnell plausible deniability.
Is it crazy to think Pelosi, Schumer and McConnell would open some back-channel on impeachment in the next few weeks? Not about impending impeachment proceedings. Just some open line of communication on how bad it would have to get to start the process.
I'd say journalists were parroting a lazy consensus among economists who didn't study unions or think about them carefully. There were clearly economists (and many sociologists) who thought about unions in more sophisticated ways. I've benefited from conversations w/many of them.

@R_Thaler If you were using AI to identify promising editorial writers, you'd probably want to identify good writers who have strong opinions. But the results could be skewed by the fact that women in journalism may be punished for expressing strong opinions, whereas men get rewarded.
@R_Thaler The machine may end up looking for attributes that white men have disproportionately, but aren't necessarily central to success at the job. Or if they are or appear to be, that's because the larger workplace is biased in some respects.
@R_Thaler Yes, I think there are reasons to believe AI can help overcome bias. But also reasons to believe it can perpetuate it. If the model is trained on historical data in which only white men did a job, then only white men will have excelled at the job. 1/

@terry_bowman Hi Terry, I cover labor for the New York Times. Am doing a story about Michigan. Any chance you'd be up for chatting?
@lsimonis first sentence alludes to macro developments like GDP and foreign policy/warmaking. (I put W in the meritocracy era, tho he's personally a descendant of the WASP estab.) 2nd sentence applies to micro level developments, in which experiences of particular people are what matters.
Also agree with Ross that we'd all be better off if we just acknowledged reality--that we still have an aristocracy--and tried to sand down the least desirable edges of it rather than pretend it doesn't exist.
Again, I'm not saying the meritocratic elite is any great shakes for the country. But there's something to be said for a system that at least feels more democratic and less arbitrary to people who have long been excluded from it.
In fairness, Ross acknowledges that the WASP estab would have had to incorporate women and people of color to survive. But if you're going to do that, seems better to rely on something that feels superficially democratic (even if it's not) than slightly expanded social networks.
Agree that you can't condemn the WASP establishment w/o comparing it to what came next, and that the meritocratic estab hasn't run the country much better. That said, from the perspective of women and people of color, it seems far, far superior. https://t.co/WOBVLW2dCE

@JuddLegum that could work. though I think you need a panicking borderline playoff team to take Wall's lousy contract. Like Detroit did with Blake Griffin last year.
I get that Beal is easier to trade. But it doesn't help you a lick. You need to move Wall. Some contending team is going to panic before the deadline and try to get an all-star point guard. Just sit tight, wait for them. Instead, I'm certain the Wizards will be the ones who panic
Why would you consider trading Bradley Beal *and* John Wall, as opposed to just Wall? Beal is a great player on a good contract. Wall is an increasingly toxic player on a bad contract. If u move Beal and not Wall, you're in worse shape than doing nothing. https://t.co/cipgLmhNNt

Let's draw some more attention to that Mahinmi detail: he makes $16 million per year, but you can't play him in an NBA game because he's not an NBA caliber player. That's a firing offense by itself.
I would throw in giving John Wall a supermax deal in the summer of 2017--despite his balky knees, his subpar shooting, and his terrible off-ball play--rather than trading him for pieces you could put around Bradley Beal, but that might have required a slightly above average GM.

@sullivanamy really?
@_AreaDan no question that the economy is the big unknown here. i think the chance of a recession is much more important than the chance of a constitutional crisis (which seems very likely, but also not something white working class voters are likely to care about).
16) But the bottom line is that Michigan is very likely to be a slog in 2020. Democrats are going to have to pour a lot of resources into it and other Midwestern states to lock them down. There is no wall.
15) Now Democrats may also have room to grow in 2020—they could boost turnout among African American voters, whose turnout on Tuesday was roughly equivalent to their 2016 turnout (suggesting a combination of a strong midterm turnout and a weak 2016 turnout).
14) It’s probably obvious why: the white working-class is 40-50 percent of the state’s electorate. White women with college degrees are only about 15 percent.
13) If he does that, Michigan is basically a tossup. I re-calculated Tuesday night’s vote, except with Trump’s 2016 white working-class margin rather than the 2018 margin, and it produces a 51-49 win for Dems (actually a bit narrower).
12) With a little course correction—more on trade, manufacturing, infrastructure; laying off tax cuts for the wealthy; not trying to undermine health insurance protections—I’d guess Trump could get back to his 2016 margin among working-class whites.
11) Also, keep in mind that Trump only had a 39 percent favorable rating in Michigan when he won in 2016.
10) True, Trump’s approval rating in Michigan’s exit poll on Tues was only 44 percent, pretty much what the GOP’s gov candidate got. But that could be as much a case of the state GOP dragging him down as vice versa.
9) Which is to say, it’s possible that, in Michigan, voters weren’t rejecting Trump on Tues; they were rejecting state Republicans. (Same goes for Wisconsin, where Scott Walker was obviously a highly divisive figure.)
8) Trump, so far as I could tell in my reporting, is still semi-popular among a lot of white working class folks, who really like his tariffs, his China-bashing, his renegotiation of NAFTA.
7) State Republicans are pretty unpopular among white working-class voters in Michigan. They’ve been very anti-union. They taxed pensions. They used a procedural trick to try to undermine a min-wage increase. They’ve allowed the roads to deteriorate badly. https://t.co/49JLTnKaDn
6) But there are a few problems here for Dems when you look to 2020.
5) They improved their performance among non-college grad whites by 19 points on Tues (losing by 31 in 2016, but only by 12 on Tuesday).
4) Overall, Dems improved their performance among college-educated white women by 20 points on Tuesday (from a 6-point win in 2016 to a 26-point win on Tues).
3) Here’s why: As I mentioned in my previous Michigan thread, Dems did very well on Tuesday with two groups: They ran up the score with affluent women, and they limited their losses among working-class whites.
2) In a nutshell: It’s still likely to be pretty damn close in those states. Nothing suggesting a blue wall—that’s very much the wrong metaphor. I’d say more like a very slight Dem skew. (The second map Nate posits, not the first.) https://t.co/Pv7ZoDTjaS

@xenocryptsite yes, tho there's now greater focus on appointing younger judges...
One of the central ironies of where we are now: In 10 yrs, Dems may have a reliable Senate majority as TX, GA, FL, NV, AZ are reliably blue. But by that point the GOP will have completely stacked the federal judiciary w/ conservative judges, and they will serve for a generation.
@jnelsonintc 100% agree. Very purple, and winnable for Trump in 2020.

@poniewozik Astead and I wrote a whole p.1 story about Monroe! It felt like ground zero.
@nickconfessore Cordray isn't a great candidate, for one thing. He's pretty stiff and lacking in charisma. And DeWine is a milquetoasty Republican who's been elected statewide several times. Has his own identity and not super identified with Trump.
13) They also really liked Gretchen Whitmer's ambitious infrastructure spending proposals, whereas Trump's infrastructure proposals have yet to amount to anything.
12) I found a lot of support for Trump's tariffs, renegotiation of NAFTA in Michigan. People lukewarm on healthcare and tax cuts.
11) I should point out, as an addendum, that white working class folks in Michigan were underwhelmed by Trump's economic agenda. But much more hostile to state GOP's economic agenda, which was very anti-union.
@dan_billings Commerce is a good call.

@marcatracy agree, it was winnable. he just wasn't a very good candidate.
In general, Dems are on more solid ground politically blocking what they see as the most offensive aspects of the Trump agenda rather than going all out w/the investigative apparatus. (Tho obviously there are very legit investigative targets.) Plus offense on health care.
It's a bummer for Dems, but Corday's just not a great candidate. He's kinda cold, lacking in charisma. I'd guess FL, GA gov races more dispiriting. Those were good candidates w/a path to winning, but raw Trumpism still works just well enough there. https://t.co/qbYogVbI4k
I think House Dems wld get much greater bang for their buck stopping the Trump census changes over investigating Trump businesses or demanding tax returns. I don't think people appreciate how bananas that story is. See this excellent @chrislhayes podcast https://t.co/PhOd2lwZWs

10) But suffice it to say their organizing efforts would not have been nearly as effective without Donald Trump in the White House.
9) Of course, a lot of credit is due here to unions and other progressive groups that organized and mobilized the hell out of Michigan for the midterms. It was basically tumbleweeds on the ground there in 2016. See here: https://t.co/49JLTnKaDn
8) Similar story if you go next door to affluent, educated Washtenaw County (home of Ann Arbor). Hillary carried it by 41 points. Dems carried it by 46 points last night in the gov’s race. (Though Obama carried it only by 36.)
7) Last night, the Dem candidate for gov carried it by 46 points.
6) Similarly, in 2016, Hillary carried Wayne County (mostly Detroit) by 37 points. That’s fine but not great for a Dem in Michigan. Obama carried it by 47 points.
5) But in the gov’s race last night, the GOP only carried it by 8 points. Doesn’t get the job done for the GOP in Michigan.
4) To take a few examples: Trump won (largely white) working-class Monroe County by 22 points in 2016. Obama had carried it in both ‘08 and ‘12.
3) Meanwhile, working class people were underwhelmed by the reality of Trump’s economic agenda, as opposed to the rhetoric.
2) Last night, Dems narrowed the margins in working-class areas, ran up huge margins in affluent and urban areas. Women and people of color were in full revolt.
Michigan’s results are a solid microcosm of where we are in the Trump era. Short version: In 2016, Trump won big margins in working-class areas that had supported Obama. Hillary’s margins in affluent areas and urban areas were underwhelming. (thread)

@jessewegman i think it's less a matter of blocking someone like Barrett, than that Trump just doesn't nominate someone like her when Collins and Murkowski are the swing votes. No longer any constraint on that.

@jessewegman Well, for one thing, if RBG can't hold out till 2020, there is zero chance Dems will be able to influence the outcome of the nomination of her replacement, whereas they had a chance of derailing Kavanaugh, albeit under unusual circumstances.

@rakeshlobster The easy compromise would be let housekeepers continue to come daily, tidy up your room. But just not change the sheets and towels until you check out or ask for them to be changed.
@rakeshlobster So people are working fewer hours, but then have to work much, much more intensively when they are working, but only have the same amount of time to do it, and for the same pay.
@rakeshlobster Problem with Green Choice is that when housekeeping doesn't come change your towels, sheets for three days, it doesn't mean you're not getting the room dirty. So when they finally do come on day 4, it's a disaster. Much more work than cleaning a single normal room.
@rakeshlobster Yes, that's true. The Green Choice program has been an issue for their hours. But they could easily strike a compromise that makes sense for both sides.

@rakeshlobster @Aspiration @AlliantCU totally agree. they're ridiculous.
@rakeshlobster @Aspiration @AlliantCU no question.
@rakeshlobster State employees in NC charges same rate regardless of FICO score. They underwrite more carefully, which CUs can do b/c they have a lot of info about income, expenses. If they think u can't repay an auto loan at 4%, they don't give u the loan, b/c u probably can't repay at 14.
@rakeshlobster @AlliantCU Yes, I think a fair number could do better turning to a commercial bank. Some have in fact been canceling their accounts and doing just that. But there's unfortunately a lot of status quo bias in people's financial services arrangements, even when they're getting ripped off.
@rakeshlobster Many other CUs may have similarly high rates for people with poor credit, but don't charge the same exorbitant fees. Some CUs--State Employees in NC--have far lower fees *and* lower rates for people with poor credit. Meijer CU in a similar low-paying service sector, does too.
@rakeshlobster Think you might have missed the point of the story, which is that low-income Marriott CU members pay exorbitantly high fees. Higher than most credit union members. Point of including that was to show they get nothing in return, in terms of access to credit.

@AlecMacGillis Agree: https://t.co/49JLTnKaDn
@TomRedburn i had confused the idea behind a grant with the idea behind an option. in my defense, i think it took a nobel prize winner to figure out the value of the latter.
@JamesSurowiecki @DLeonhardt Mostly agree. Tho think the onus is on them to give a sense of what percentage is actually likely to earn more rather than asserting "we're Amazon and we say everyone is going to be better off."
@JamesSurowiecki @DLeonhardt Or are they saying I'm going to do better than current wage + max bonus + stock grant? If it's this last one, great, but I'm skeptical. Seems at odds with reporting from workers, though maybe the workers had outdated info.
@JamesSurowiecki @DLeonhardt For example, suppose that last year i got a small ($500) bonus, but the yr before I got a $4,000 bonus. (Amazon says bonus can raise salary up to 16%). Is Amazon promising I do better than current wage + $500 + stock grant, or current wage + $4,000 + plus stock grant?
@JamesSurowiecki @DLeonhardt Agree with you about the problem with incentive pay. That said, it's hard to believe they can say with certainty that *all* workers (as opposed to the average, or even 90th percentile worker) will do better when they're replacing variable pay with fixed pay.
@JamesSurowiecki @DLeonhardt ah, fair enough. i'm confusing the logic of options and grants.
@JamesSurowiecki @DLeonhardt I'm still skeptical about the stock grants, and how they're valued. If they increased my pay by $2,000 and took away my single share of Amazon stock at $1,835, I call that a loss.
@DLeonhardt Sorry, on valuing stock grant, you have to do more than value it at its current price, no? You need some estimate of future appreciation baked in. Is that what you meant? A share of Amazon stock is more valuable to me than the $1800 its worth today...
@DLeonhardt Yes, that's fair. I'm skeptical that Amazon is ensuring that this math works out for every worker, as opposed to in the aggregate, but open to the idea. Do you have what they told Bernie? I couldn't find it.

@juliaioffe Christ. Who are these f****n people?!
@Eric_B_Meyer Right. If the shoulder that sent him to the DL twice and looked shaky at the end of the season holds up, it will have been an inspired move. Less so if he's mediocre in his next 2-3 starts and we later find out he aggravated his shoulder.
@TomRedburn I'm high on Sale, just wouldn't have put the extra stress on his iffy shoulder. But yeah, Kimbrel is a surprise. Seems like the pressure has gotten to him.
@Eric_B_Meyer or not be 100% when he starts again. i'm sure he'll be available.
@Eric_B_Meyer the concern isn't that he couldn't pitch a good inning. it's that he'd compromise his shoulder and not be available when the Red Sox need him in subsequent rounds. talk to me when he starts again.

@aaronvandorn It's legitimate. Just not ipso facto disqualifying. The most credible critique of a Supreme Court nominee is the one that is an automatic deal breaker. That's perjury.
Dems seem less credible criticizing Kavanaughs temperament, partisanship &amp; falsehoods. Feels like throwing stuff against the wall. Even if all are legit critiques, only 1 is ipso facto disqualifying - perjury. More credible to focus entirely on that.  https://t.co/vFMcRtLgRB

I still think Kavs chances of confirmation are no worse than 60-40. But if he goes down, this seems like the most likely channel.
@Glenn_OBX @LOLGOP It's not about whether it matters to Collins personally. It's about whether it flies politically. She'd clearly like to vote for him. But she knows she needs a cover story. If her cover story gets eviscerated, it doesn't really work as a cover story.
Most direct way that the dishonesty of Kavanaughs testimony hurts his chances: Collins, Murkowski say they need to believe he won't overturn Roe. Collins said Kav assured her it was settled law. If it's clear that he lied repeatedly to the Senate, those assurances are worthless.
@wjcarter Very good chance we end up with absence of evidence of sexual assault. No chance we end up with absence of evidence of perjury.

One person whose honest opinion about Kavanaugh's testimony I'd be curious to hear: Neil Gorsuch, who graduated from Georgetown Prep two years later.
@dabernathy89 In order for his statement to have any weight as evidence, that would have to be the case. Perhaps they had a rare but militant insistence on associating exclusively with girls who attended Catholic schools, but suffice it to say I'm skeptical.
@dabernathy89 it would be pretty remarkable if most other boys in Kavanaugh's class at Georgetown prep routinely associated with girls from all the schools Kav mentioned + Holton-Arms, but Kav's group of friends only associated with girls from those schools, and never Holton-Arms.

Dear Twitter: Yes, Dems clearly whiffed by not making more of the July 1 entry on Kavanaugh's own calendar that appeared to corroborate Ford's allegation. But wouldn't the muuuuuch bigger whiff be for the Senate not to explore it further before the vote?
@HotlineJosh My point is: is the bigger case of malpractice that Dems didn't bring it up at yesterday's hearing, or that we won't further explore corroborating evidence of alleged sexual assault--from documents provided by the accused!--before he's confirmed to the Supreme Court?

This exercise seems utterly pointless unless Kavanaugh can prove that there wasn't a single evening in the summer of 1982 when he could have turned up at a small gathering with friends.
Yes, that's implicitly the argument. But if it's the actual argument, then Kavanaugh should say so. Let people decide if they believe she's a left-wing pawn. https://t.co/RYJagfFZH8
Six clean-slate FBI background checks doesn't seem very exculpatory. If the FBI had talked to Blasey Ford during any of those background checks, she presumably would have told the same story she's telling today.
Kavanaugh's argument that this is a leftwing smear seems in tension with his earlier concession that Blasey Ford is sincere, just mistaken in her assailant's identity.
@TomRedburn Think it's safe to say this is a turnout effort, not a persuasion effort.
Kavanaugh to Trump: this is not about me. It's about you.
Also, why is he yelling?

Yes, that was very emotional. https://t.co/g8iYY2kZZn
The way this is shaping up, you're going to have Dem Senators asking empathetic questions which get at the trauma that Dr. Blasey Ford has endured, book-ended by a prosecutor conducting a micro-level interrogation in 5-min increments. The latter feels goofy as hell.
Seems safe to say the GOP didn't think through all the mechanics of how this questioning by an outside prosecutor would work when Senators are only supposed to question in 5-minute increments.
Mitchell seems totally competent and professional, but this seems like the kind of questioning that should be happening behind closed doors, before the Senators who have to make a final decision question Blasey Ford publicly.
@AlexaMRomero Fair point. And fair to the accused. Are there any rules governing whether and how a prospective employer can investigate an allegation?

The reporting today makes it sound like it was just a foregone conclusion. But this was a huge point of contention.

@conncarroll Judge and Kavanaugh portray this as completely outside the realm of possibility, even tho that appears to be contradicted by Kavanaugh's "what stays at Georgetown prep" riff and Judges books. A lot of light can be shed on whether it's outside or well within the realm of possibity

@ManohlaDargis Hi! I guess i just had higher hopes, but maybe that's on me, not the series. (Or on me and your colleagues in the criticism business...)
@vanityman but that isn't much of a fight, is it?
@joshchafetz yeah, as with the whole series, it was well done. but the ending frustrated me and took the sheen of the rest of the episode. felt like it exposed some potentially deeper flaws in the series, in the way that the last episode of True Detective did, tho this K.E. is much better.
10) I don’t understand the praise for it. The episode wasn’t quite the disaster that the ending of season 1 of True Detective was. It held my attention most of the way through. But I’m not sure it left the series in a much better place.
9) Almost literally. Just a few scenes earlier, Eve and Villanelle had guns pointed at each other, then Villanelle slipped away.
8) Sure, the next season could surprise me and move in a different direction. I'm sure there will be some twists. But even on its own terms, the ending was bad. It doubled-back to a place we’d just been.
7) I groaned when (spoiler alert) Villanelle slipped out of the apartment after Eve stabbed her. Here we go again.
6) It feels like the only place the relationship between Eve and Villanelle can move is laterally, which isn’t very interesting. Feels like it’s on the verge of becoming a slickly produced Road Runner v. Wile E. Coyote.
5) If Villanelle isn’t redeemable, what psychological development can we possibly expect? The point of a psychopath is that they don’t do psychological development.
4) Instead, we’re looking at another season of the same basic back and forth between Eve and Villanelle.
3) Great decision. I wouldn’t have changed a thing in the first 7 episodes. But here’s the problem: if she’s not remotely redeemable, then the Villanelle portion of the plot needed to end with the final episode.
All the critics have cheered the way Villanelle doesn’t succumb to your standard redeemability trope. This is totally true - she’s a psychopath, plain and simple, and neither she nor the writers apologize for that.
We finished Killing Eve last night. Like everyone else, I thought the series was terrific. But that last episode, was -- what’s the critical term? -- blech. I don’t understand how it didn’t provoke a mass uprising.

@juliaioffe i wouldn't assume that this victory won't also be tainted by very compelling allegations of doping.
@PolitcalGuru @AthenaTweets why do millions of people who listen to NPR regularly and enjoy it decide not to contribute to it?
7) The loss of revenue from members who quit the union will be a big blow. That revenue was funding both workplace activities and political activities, which was perfectly fair because they were members. Now that revenue will completely disappear.
6) So now it's much more attractive for current members--even members who are perfectly happy being in a union--to drop out. They get a 100% refund on their dues, and the union still represents them at the bargaining table and in grievances, etc. So rational to drop out.
5) But of course there's another huge effect on their budgets: Current union members now have a different financial calculation. Instead of deciding between paying 100% of dues as members, and 80% of dues as non-members, they now choose between 100% of dues, and 0 as non-members.
Even if the unions were completely abiding by the law - spending no agency fee payer money on politics, only on bargaining, grievances, etc. - the loss of fee payer money still limits the $ they can spend on politics. Because they have less $ to pay for the stuff they have to do.
3) That has two big effects on union budgets. First, they lose all money from fee-payers. They used to pay 80%, now they pay nothing. That money used to fund contract negotiations, grievance proceedings, etc. Now unions don't have it, so have less money to spend on everything.
2) But the plaintiff in the case complained that even the other stuff unions do - like negotiate contracts - is political on some level. Supreme Court agreed and said, 'hard to draw the line between what's political and what isn't, so we're killing all the fees for non-members.'
Lots of confusion on last week's Supreme Court ruling on unions, so let me try to clarify: 		1) Even before the ruling, ppl could opt out of paying dues. Instead, they paid agency fees, about 80% of dues. The 20% discount was so they wouldn't have to fund overt political spending
@brianmacp if you're perfectly happy being a union member it's still a rational decision to opt out and pay nothing. you're still covered by the union contract, they still have to represent you in grievance proceedings, etc.
@brianmacp no one was required to be a union member even before this decision. you could always opt out, pay an agency fee. the reason unions are likely to lose a lot of members now is that, instead of getting a 20% discount on your dues when u opt out, you now get 100% refund.
@brianmacp the point is the being a union member, on its own, tends to make you vote more Democratic. you may still vote after ceasing to become a union member, but you're significantly less likely to vote Democratic.

“If the progressive movement is a navy, they’re trying to take out our aircraft carriers.” With last week's Supreme Court ruling on unions, conservatives achieved their goal of cutting off tens of millions of dollars/yr to Dem candidates and liberal groups https://t.co/XXcbAf4RZ2
Last week’s Supreme Court decision against unions will cost Democratic candidates and progressive groups tens of millions of dollars per year in funding. Here's who loses and how much: https://t.co/XXcbAf4RZ2
To the extent you can say these things about a regular season game, i'm going to say the Nats 13-inning loss to the Phillies today is the day their season ended.

@aspaglayan @charlesjkenny @greenhousenyt @BucciSays yeah, that's a totally good definition in many contexts, but i wanted to avoid the tautology issue Agustina alluded to. i wanted to describe a mechanism allows that to occur.
Good for Rent the Runway. Will be interesting to see how it affects profitability. My guess is it goes up. https://t.co/mjNf3GLPis
@aspaglayan @greenhousenyt @BucciSays yep, agree with all this. i'm just making the case for a similarly nuanced analysis of union strength - not just looking at CB laws but strength/power as it plays out on the ground, with member involvement.
@aspaglayan @greenhousenyt @BucciSays in the same way, "strength" isn't formal CB rights or even union membership (though may be correlated). it's how many divisions the union can command, to put it in Stalinistic terms.
@aspaglayan @greenhousenyt @BucciSays "how strikes are regulated" is diff from "regulations." latter is the law, former is the reality. strikes are illegal in West VA, OK, AZ, but obviously didn't stop people from walking out. this is my point: u have to look at what happens on the ground, not the institutional form.
@aspaglayan @greenhousenyt @BucciSays regulations are a formalistic and misleading way of looking at the question. a state could have strong CB rights, high rates of unionization, but union doesn't do very well for its members because can't get a few thousand people to a protest.
@aspaglayan @greenhousenyt @BucciSays no, not tautological. you've mischaracterized what i said in the story, and my earlier response to you. the measure of union strength that would capture my argument is % of workers in a unionized occupation who regularly show up to union meetings and events.
Very important column from @DLeonhardt today. https://t.co/oRMGjpOTOH

I don't envy Fox trying to gin up World Cup viewership w/o the US in it, but this marketing campaign is embarrassingly weak. "We're all connected to a World Cup team through our DNA"? How about, don't miss one of the most exciting spectacles in sports?
@aspaglayan cops and firefighters often do quite well in RTW states &amp; states with weak CB rights because they're membership is very engaged, makes the unions powerful.
@aspaglayan if you want to get empirically at the concept i'm describing in the piece, you'd need to measure, say, the percentage of union members who show up to multiple meetings/union events in a year.
@aspaglayan I'd say, echoing your logic, that causality runs other way. Political strength often leads to strong CB rights. But having strong CBR need not imply union strength. can lead to apathy, backlash. &amp; losing CBR need not undermine strength. They are separate (tho related) phenomena.
@aspaglayan I think you're defining strong union much too narrowly. Strong CB rights can increase union strength, or not. In the piece I define strong as having an engaged, easily mobilized membership. That can happen in states with strong CB rights, or weak. See Racine.
Do the teacher strikes in right to work states like West VA, OK, AZ show that workers are more powerful when unions are weak? Actually, they show the opposite. https://t.co/7hSTibuJsr

@ScribnerUMCP Chicago teachers union would be another example. Strong union, very effective community outreach.
@ScribnerUMCP no reason you can't build coalitions when your union is strong. that's what teachers did very effectively in Racine. But if you don't have infrastructure that strong unions provide (tho other organizations can too), your movement won't last very long.
With the successful teacher strikes in right to work states like WV, OK, and AZ, you might think teachers have more political clout when unions are weak. But you'd be emphatically wrong! https://t.co/iNCzGnDbw3

They reason they haven't been able to do the economically rational thing and add staff and hours is that many are public companies, and activist and institutional investors would pummel their stock price if they increase labor costs.

@brynstole Fair enough. Tho I think it's worth pointing out two things in Huizenga's defense: 1) The Marlins were probably much more dependent on the volume of ticket sales than brand-name teams like the Yankees, because they didn't have the same pricing power, and TV revenue.

@vtg2 Actually, that's not entirely fair. There's a strong case to be made for Geithner as Treasury sec up till mid-09. Not a bad person to have at the height of the financial crisis. But you needed to replace him once you turned to reform. He was too implicated in the old system.
@vtg2 I laid out the full case here: https://t.co/qHMzKN1570
@vtg2 The point was that Geithner had the wrong worldview and life experience for someone running Treasury in 2009-2013. I'm not saying you shouldn't have hired something with financial market expertise. Just not the top former regulator of the country's biggest banks.
@vtg2 I was alluding more broadly to the debate between structural reforms and new regulations. Geithner had sublime faith in regulations and regulators. I think that faith was misplaced for a variety of reasons.
@vtg2 The story we ran lists a handful of examples. Including the fact that CFPB is run by a guy named Mick Mulvaney. He's staffing up in ways that take the agency in a completely different direction.
@vtg2 it's not just the legislation. as the story notes, a lot of this happens through personnel and rule-making. (the latter two were the bigger concerns raised with geithner at the time.) collectively, they will go a long way toward undermining the point of D-F.
Another thing: If you're wondering about the health of these banks that are supposedly being strangled by Dodd-Frank, you can rest easy. Goldman Sachs put out a report 2 wks ago predicting extreme profitability for banks. They called it the "blue sky scenario." Warms your heart. https://t.co/1MuUBlX4ha
Also, let's note that the only person on the planet surprised by the unmaking of Dodd-Frank may be Tim Geithner. I remember many reporters asking--if the next GOP admin is just going to undo this, shouldn't u break up the banks instead? He always assured us it wasn't necessary.
I've never understood why Senators from places like Montana &amp; North Dakota believe their constituents want lax oversight of banks. I mean, NY, NJ, CT, I can see. (And SD for strange reasons.) But how does the avg farmer benefit from deregulating Wall St? https://t.co/kqfBNHxJUA

What happens to health care benefits when Walmart comes to town, versus when Amazon comes to town (via some exclusive internal docs)  https://t.co/SR3QjipEMp
@Vegan_in_Furs it was supported by the facts/documents. health care benefits are taking a substantial hit, at least for hourly workers, who were the focus of the story.
@Vegan_in_Furs this is what walmart's benefits comparison doc says about STD and parental/maternity leave. first modcloth, then walmart. https://t.co/ik38tNQ1sw
@Vegan_in_Furs and the fact is that amazon's health benefits are significantly better, and that's who walmart is ultimately competing with.
@Vegan_in_Furs and while it's true that most people's health benefits are gradually getting worse, the magnitude of the worsening here was and order of magnitude or two larger than most people experience in a given year or two.
@Vegan_in_Furs we added language about the 401k match. on maternity leave, that's not correct. at modcloth, mothers got 12 weeks at 60% pay thru the short-term disability policy. at walmart its 12 weeks full pay.

@felixsalmon one common recommendation was that people should first try to work b/w 2am and 6am, to boost their performance metrics, so that the routing algorithm would then reward them during normal hours.

@moorehn yep. i linked to a similar one--companies cut CEOs all kinds of slack once they've been on a magazine cover. And the CEOs proceed to stink.
@moorehn 100%. They almost categorically underestimate the financial cost of harassment. And overestimate the value of a star.
Thing is, it's a good idea to fire the superstar harasser even if u don't care abt harassment, just the bottom line https://t.co/1Uj9guTl2h https://t.co/wi0MrmtHfz

@seeglazek @jbarro that's what makes the timing thing seem suspect in his case. but i agree that the pressure was likely to be greater than ever now. 2/
@seeglazek @jbarro i guess that's right. he's resisted coming out in the face of a lot of these stories/observations over the years. 1/
@karynelevy @seeglazek @jbarro also true!
@seeglazek @jbarro could've said, i have a ton of respect for Anthony Rapp, but i honestly have no idea what he's talking about.
@seeglazek @jbarro he'd have to come out if he owned up to the allegations. but he stopped short of conceding it happened, said he didn't recall it.
@jbarro but that's all i'm conceding!
@jbarro yeah, i guess that's what seemed off--like he's implicitly saying, i never would've admitted to being gay, but i guess i have to concede it
@jbarro The 1 diff is it had a weird "pleading to a lesser offense" subtext. Which, uh, doesn't seem like the way you'd want people coming out.
Definitely the right move to take him out.
That out would give me no confidence to keep Will Harris out there if I were the Astros.
Makes the playoffs way more exciting, but leaves all the regular season records intact.
If MLB is using juiced balls, they're getting a huge return on investment here. Not a terrible idea to break them out for the post-season.
Amazing in that, if you're just slightly off your game as a pitcher, even avg MLB hitter will often make you pay. Good one will PUNISH you.
Seems like this tells you how bad Morrow was pitching. And that's kinda true. But really it tells you how amazing MLB hitters are.

@drewmckevitt strategy was to pressure the parent company leadership situated at Renault in France--that's the new wrinkle in the last few years.
@Nowooski @NathanBomey VW was neutral and it was a narrow loss. When company is neutral, doesn't mean you win, but you have a chance. No chance otherwise.
Anyway, bottom line is: a union will not win a vote against major employer in South w/o the company sitting it out. Way too much leverage.
I guess it just became clear it wasn't happening, and the political context in the Trump era was getting worse, so window was closing.
In fact, still a bit of a mystery why UAW went ahead in Miss w/o neutrality agreement, since they made such a big push for it.
I'd be shocked if another union takes on another major company in the South going forward w/o securing the neutrality agreement first.
Union can file unfair labor practice charges, but even if they win (and they won't under Trump's NLRB), doesn't get them much.
If the company is involved and opposed to the union, they have almost limitless power to cajole, coerce, intimidate workers.
One big takeaway from recent blowouts against labor in union votes in the South: theres no viable path w/o a neutrality agreement w/company.

@JamesSurowiecki this'll clearly accelerate that. if 5-10% of workforce supports itself thru temp gigs in temp orgs in 10 yrs, that has massive implications
@JamesSurowiecki but it's inarguable that the trend to the last 40 yrs has been to push work out of the firm if it can be pushed out.
@JamesSurowiecki i'm not someone who believes firms are on the verge of extinction. i agree there are very good, under-appreciated reasons for them to exist.
@ToniMacAttack believe me, there's no assumption (on my part) that platforms will step in. i'm pessimistic abt what this will do to inequality, insecurity.

@keithkml right, likewise.
@manan19 so pool pays them marginally more, for a lot more work. higher utilization, higher efficiency, but bad deal for drivers!
@manan19 and pool is that same story to the nth degree. they consider it much more work to drive w/two perfect strangers in the back.
@manan19 and that's actually completely rational! they're getting paid less per unit of work in the higher utilization world.
@manan19 most drivers are going to prefer making $25/hr taking 2 trips working 30 mins to $27/hour taking 4 trips working 40 mins.
@manan19 uber says great! that's a win for us, win for passengers, win for drivers. but it's not!
@manan19 so a driver who used to be able to make $25/hour taking two 15-min trips can now make $27/hour taking 4 10-minute trips.
@manan19 do the thought experiment this way. suppose Uber is right (&amp; i think you guys are) that lower fares increase demand, which increase utilizn
@manan19 @keithkml have you talked to drivers? i've talked to dozens. fairly certain they value scarcity.
@keithkml dynamic that post alludes to all happens over months. theres no "efficiency" button ops people can turn up today. only SR lever is supply.
@keithkml you're missing the pt. on any given day, if Uber wants to lower passenger idle time, it needs more driver idle time.
@keithkml very depressing to me when someone who's presumably smart and very well educated would unsubscribe to NYT on basis of misinformation.
@keithkml i wld do some thinking for yourself rather than taking cues from PR release. or even just read the PR release carefully.
@keithkml but it does in SR, as their post concedes. and my story is all abt the tools you use on any given day to adjust supply to avoid shortages.
@keithkml i don't want to be uncharitable to them, b/c it's fair for them to pt out that shorter wait times doesn't necess mean more idle time in LR.
@keithkml their post even concedes this.
@keithkml their post is pretty misleading. their argument is about the long-term, our simulation was about the short-term, when demand is fixed.
@keithkml drivers value scarcity, uber wants none. uber confirmed that repeatedly in our conversations, has never denied it.
@keithkml that chart doesn't in the least invalidate my thesis. my thesis is that Uber's incentives are not aligned with drivers.
@keithkml I ran every fact in that piece relating to Uber by the Uber folks, often multiple times &amp; made many changes as a result of their feedback.

@otis_reid this is my gift to you - a QJE article waiting to happen. all you have to do is wangle the data out of Uber...
@JoshuaMound @Econ_Marshall right. i mean, seems to me NLRA is a huge check against worst exploitation. but, oops, doesn't apply to Uber drivers!
@otis_reid there are clearly counterveiling effects on wages: &gt; efficiency cld lead to more rides/hr; larger supply could depress $/ride (&amp; ride/hr)
@otis_reid i don't think that's necessarily true - see my response to you on that point.
@otis_reid i cited their claims in my original story!
@otis_reid in some cases, you're busier, so hourly wage goes up. but this is massively depressing surge, so big downward effect too.
@otis_reid i'm skeptical of the hourly wage effect. my sense from talking to some ex-Uber engineers is its probably close to a wash.
@otis_reid presumably Uber/Lyft wouldn't concede that the effect is substantial if it weren't.
@otis_reid i interpreted that as 10-20% on its own.
@otis_reid the queuing effect is very large on its own. uber/lyft didn't give me exact numbers, but both conceded it was substantial.
@otis_reid uber and lyft both told me they weren't quite there with the personalization yet, but were working on it. getting there.
@otis_reid yes, but they're increasingly able to target. so they'll use the different strategies on different people, depending on what works for whom
@otis_reid others, like queuing rides, can accomplish &gt; 20% supply-hour increase on their own.
@otis_reid if uber deploys several at once, they can get into the 10-20% range on supply hours.
@otis_reid fair enough. i think the right way to think about it is some of these techniques is will have marginal effects - 1,2,3%.

@barryfreed2013 am i sure? no. would i bet in that direction rather than the other direction? without question.
@Econ_Marshall exactly. that's been the most frustrating response to the piece by far. they don't do it all the time to workers!
@tannercolby appreciate it!
@Econ_Marshall exactly. that was intended to be a key premise of the piece - feel like it's gotten a little bit lost in the aftermath.
29. That would drive up labor costs by ~25%. So this largely makes possible a transfer of billions in surplus from workers to Uber.
28. If Uber can’t influence when, where, how long people work in this way, probly can’t use IC model, wld have to have employees.
27. Finally, you miss the biggest prob, noted at top of story: these techniques are the key to making contractor model viable for Uber.
26. They’re a lot less likely to keep good records, scrutinize earnings. No reason Uber can’t keep manipulating many/most indefinitely.
25. These people are increasingly the Uber/gig economy labor force. There are millions of them, potentially 10s of millions.
24. More broadly, the people Uber can really manipulate are the underemployed who aren’t driving full time.
23. So at a min, people are getting screwed for months before they figure it out and move on. That’s a lot of cash!
22. Two problems here. First, most drivers don’t sit down and scrutinize their net earnings till tax season.
21. You also seem overconfident in workers’ ability to avoid being exploited, saying they’ll look at earnings and figure it out.
20. In the same vein, Uber/Lyft concede that queuing up drivers’ next rides has a very substantial effect on amount of time they drive.
19. Can move uptake from single digits to ~90%. Would it make sense to dismiss that b/c it sounds simple?
18. We know something as simple as asking people to opt out of becoming an organ donor rather than opt in has an enormous effect.
17. But that’s not an argument, it’s just wordplay. You need to judge them by their effect. Some are small, some very large.
16. Also, you dismiss these techniques, like queuing up drivers’ next trips, because they sound simple, innocuous.
15. They can even exploit completely atheoretic, idiosyncratic quirks they just stumble across in the data.
14. They can figure out who’s an income targeter, who lacks self-control in certain situations, and exploit it. That’s unprecedented.
13. Short version: Companies are developing ability to tailor their manipulation around each person’s unique psychological weaknesses.
12. And this paper by Calo and Alex Rosenblat, https://t.co/7kIwxwFsut
11. In this vein, you should read this paper by Ryan Calo describing next generation of psychological manipulation https://t.co/DBMYACTtR2
10. Big data, machine learning, etc. are massively increasing the power asymmetry between exploiters and exploitees.
9. True. But the trend lines emphatically do not favor consumers/workers.
8. You say the history of attempts to manipulate people through advertising/behavioral tricks is that people eventually get wise to it.
7. And Uber can use these techniques way more aggressively b/c its workers are contractors. So not protected by employment, labor laws.
6. Also, drivers’ entire work-life is mediated through the app, so there’s no part Uber can’t experiment on, optimize.
5. But Uber can do this stuff with way more sophistication, since it collects much richer data.
4. Yes, some companies try to influence workers using nudges, gamification, as the piece concedes.
3. What’s new is for companies to use these techniques on their own workers, at least on the scale Uber does.
2. My story concedes that it’s exceedingly common for companies to use these behavioral techniques on consumers.
1. Jeff raises some fair points here. Tho some I addressed in the piece, &amp; others I don’t think hold up in practice https://t.co/I4Qs1iRCyz
@monicadavey1 appreciate it!
@nielsvdoorn as i say in the story, when the entire work experience is mediated through an app, no limits to gamification, testing, iterating.
@nielsvdoorn many of the psychological techniques are new in application to workers. gamification's not. but uber's ability to gamify far greater.
@glacialspeed From, uh, working below minimum wage and working &gt; 40 hours per week w/o additional compensation. For starters...
@karaswisher Thx. Applying these techniques to workers on this scale unprecedented. Co's have much greater ability to manipulate workers than consumers.
No question, but they do it to consumers. What's knew is doing it to yr workers, who are supposed to be protected. https://t.co/NGLnhFJnVn

Cubs apparently not going undefeated this year, alas.
@Rochelle thank you Rochelle!
@bendreyfuss @petersterne but when all uber drivers work longer, they drive down their own wages. (kill surge.) so longer work for less pay can mean &lt; min wage.
@bendreyfuss @petersterne well, that can be part of it. but as i explain in the story, their whole thrust is to get people to work a little longer.
@bendreyfuss @petersterne the issue is getting you to essentially work overtime w/o paying you for it, which is illegal in an employment context. or below min wage.
@bendreyfuss @petersterne the issue here isn't advertising a max unlikely to be achieved--tho FTC is supposed to crack down on that (as it actually has with Uber).
@petersterne can't use them to get you to work for below the salary/wage they suggested they would pay you.
@petersterne they can use lots of tricks, can't use them to get you to work below minimum wage or (for hourly workers) &gt; 40hrs/wk without paying OT
@gpanger yes, they benefit from scarcity, uber is intent on eliminating scarcity. piece explains why, and the simulations illustrate it vividly.
@gpanger Don't see how it helps to feel good if you're being tricked into doing something that's against your self-interest.
@gpanger Think you're missing the pt, which is that interests of Uber &amp; drivers diverge &amp; Uber often tricks them into doing what's good for Uber.

10. And my guess is Obama's rules were written more tightly, w/more attention to detail, than Trump's will be. Based on available info.
9. I'm guessing fed judges in CA, WA will have no prob slapping natl injunction on Trump rules. Fed judges in TX did this to Obama rules.
8. Shouldnt be too hard for these groups to prevail if new Trump rules are sloppy, esp bc they will venue-shop like conservs did to Obama.
7. If you're bad at rulemaking, &amp; it's a good bet Trump admin will be bc it takes lots of attention to detail, groups are going to sue.
6. To undo rules that went through rulemaking process, as big Obama climate regs did, you've got to go thru the rulemaking process again.
5. Irony of Bannon attacking "administrative state" is they're going to need admin state to rewrite Obama regs. Can't just press "delete."
4. On top of which, he wants to cut 3,200 people from EPA, presumably many ppl who know how to write regs. So it's by no means a done deal.
3. If not done competently, Trump rewriting of Obama climate regs will collapse in court, like immigrtn order. How confident are we in this?
2. Not clear to me Trump will have whole lot more success rewriting Obama climate regs than repealing ACA. It's only somewhat easier.
Trump signs exec ordr rolling back Obama climate policies. Are we sure he knows u have to rewrite regs to actually do this, which takes yrs?

@HeerJeet @AlecMacGillis @JamesSurowiecki agree. needed to be some practical upshot. this way just highlighted what 43% liked about him.
@JamesSurowiecki @AlecMacGillis as Alec said, far and away the most common reason for supporting him was "speaks his mind" - 43%.
@JamesSurowiecki @AlecMacGillis they only needed 50k votes in WI, MI, PA.  obviously that's "partial equilibrium," but suggests was doable.
@JamesSurowiecki @AlecMacGillis critiques w/o a frame aren't super helpful. frame was he was unfit, not a fraud/hypocrite.
@JamesSurowiecki @AlecMacGillis it was broader than self-dealing. it was depicting him as a fraud and a hypocrite.
@JamesSurowiecki @AlecMacGillis "For some, however, our engagement – a combination of validation and information – gave them pause."
@JamesSurowiecki @AlecMacGillis Many who [liked] Trump bc “speaks his mind” didnt see way forward other than thru firestorm of Trump rhetorc
@JamesSurowiecki @AlecMacGillis "A voter for whom immigration was paramount issue was uneasy [about] Trump’s use of undocumented workers"
@JamesSurowiecki @AlecMacGillis "was less enthused when he considered Trump’s bankruptcies and his tax plan that favors the wealthy"
@JamesSurowiecki @AlecMacGillis "An Ohioan who said his biggest issue was the economy and that he liked Trump’s business experience"
@JamesSurowiecki @AlecMacGillis  "and opened the way to more nuanced conversations about the issues at stake."
@JamesSurowiecki @AlecMacGillis "In many of these conversations, disparity b/w what Trump says and what he actually does, gave voters pause"
@AlecMacGillis in fairness, their strategy of harvesting college-educated suburbanites looked a lot better b/4 the comey letters. but still.
@AlecMacGillis from Jan 2016 report on WWC Trump supporters: "disparity b/w what Trump says and what he actually does, gave voters pause"
@AlecMacGillis extensive focus groups w/WWC by AFL-backed Working America strongly suggested this was right path https://t.co/8j6q12p5Sd

@Austan_Goolsbee yes, but D-F was a big missed opp. other than a few solid features, like Volcker rule, very little structural change.
@KennethBaer true, though you can bet most of the slippage, in margins at least if not turnout, came from the former.
Poll commissioned by AFL-CIO shows that union voters (not households) went Clinton 56-37. In 2012, they went 65-33 Obama. So slippage...

Will it be that hard for Dems to retake MI, PA, WI w/right cand? Don't think so. Absent Trump, which party's econ policies more populist?
Put differently: if you had to choose, wld you choose ideologically split party w/shrinking coalition, or unified party w/growing coalition?
@drpetebrowncdu doesn't need to be that high. just need to be slightly higher than hillary. a lot of room b/w her in 16 and Obama in 12.

@RachelMorris @avizenilman @IChotiner yes, i'm interested in the climate change stories. tho most useful ones won't be out for a while.
@avizenilman @IChotiner @RachelMorris but if there are daily natural disasters for weeks on end, capacity to read about each one diminishes.
@avizenilman @IChotiner @RachelMorris second one happens, and you're still able to digest it. 3/
@avizenilman @IChotiner @RachelMorris the first one happens, and you're like, oh my god. you can't get enough. 2/
@avizenilman @IChotiner @RachelMorris i think of it the way i think over our ability to digest coverage of natural disasters. 1/
@avizenilman @IChotiner @RachelMorris yes, and i'm saying the details have ceased to be interesting. there's no modulation--too much crazy.
@IChotiner @RachelMorris and even the extent of the damage is hard to get our heads around till after election. tho makes senate interesting
@IChotiner @RachelMorris but coverage of trump himself--what he says and does--has ceased to be interesting to me.
@IChotiner @RachelMorris i think the only interesting question is how deep the damage extends. those stories are interesting. 1/
@RachelMorris it was interesting then. but it's been 6-7 months of that...
@RachelMorris i just think we've been working off the damaged GOP storyline since he became the primary frontrunner. 1/
@RachelMorris yes, but the math hasn't changed. he's running a primary campaign in a general. if if started to work, that'd be interesting..
@IChotiner @RachelMorris just another data point in the trump es loco narrative, which is very familiar by this point.
@RachelMorris means everyone was basically right that this demographic can win you the GOP primary, but not the general...
@RachelMorris would be interesting if trump elevated bannon and then surged in the polls. but that didn't happen. 1/
@RachelMorris but it's not really changing--same storyline since trump surge in primaries. in fact, bannon basically a return to primaries.
@IChotiner @AlecMacGillis @RachelMorris its groundhog day. trump says something nuts. vows to rein it in. does for day. then back to nuts.
@IChotiner @AlecMacGillis @RachelMorris but we knew that already, &amp; how HRC felt about it. initial novelty was interesting, but no 2nd act.
@AlecMacGillis @IChotiner agree w/Alec. At a certain pt, all the nutty stuff trump says and does blends together &amp; ceases to be interesting.
The appearance of Doug Band in those Clinton emails makes it a good time to re-up @AlecMacGillis's masterful profile https://t.co/t2xDZZ88Mn
Is it possible that this election has turned into the last thing most of us expected back in the spring--which is kinda, you know, boring?

@goldietaylor so that the only 2 options wouldn't be live entirely around whites, or live around black people, but in a much poorer n-hood.
@goldietaylor crazy that there wouldn't at least be more working-class n'hoods that would have a mix of affluent and less affluent AA's. 3/
@goldietaylor that is, the idea that an affluent African American would have to live in a poor n'hood to live around other AA's. 2/
@goldietaylor the basic pt was not surprising for the reasons you say. whats surprising is that there doesnt appear to be a middle ground 1/
@jbouie numbers in story suggest working class whites can live lot of places, but working class blacks only in poor neighborhoods. it's nuts
@jbouie but if you're black and working class, seems like you don't even have much of a choice. 3/
@jbouie more affluent blacks have a choice, tho they pay a big penalty if they want to live around other black people, as you say. 2/
@jbouie one part of the story i thought was unexplored was working class blacks. 1/
