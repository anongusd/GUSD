The US must always be willing to meet with our adversaries in pursuit of peace, but our history of regime change war and breaking agreements undermines our credibility. This is why Kim doesn't trust us.
Yesterday’s failure to come to an agreement on NK’s nukes brings me no joy, but rather deep concern. But as I said yesterday on @Hardball, NK will not give up their nukes unless there is a complete re-appraisal of US regime-change “foreign policy.” https://t.co/l4UmUIlsOf

For a nation of immigrants, wrestling with the legacy of slavery and a desire to live up to our founding ideals, Hawai'i stands as a shining example of how to heal divides, unify our country, and bring lasting peace through the power of aloha.
Despite being the most remote of the 50 states, Hawai'i has had a historic impact on the rest of the country.
Heightening tensions with Russia and China are sending us into a new Cold War. We need to be stepping up nuclear nonproliferation agreements, not rolling them back. Trumps actions threaten our national security and the future of our planet.

Veterans who survived combat are now suffering from rare cancers, lung diseases, neurological disorders, &amp; more. Today we intro'd Burn Pits Accountability Act to help make sure veterans can get the care they've earned. Thanks @IAVA for your leadership!
Toxic burn pits are the Agent Orange of our post-9/11 generation of veterans. When I was deployed to Iraq, the cloud of toxic smoke and fumes from the massive burn pit on our camp was an every day reality. I know the damage they can cause. #BURNPITS

I regret the role I played in causing such pain, and I remain committed to fighting for LGBTQ+ equality. You can learn more about my legislative record here: https://t.co/EDmF7KuMvY
I’m so grateful to my friends and loved ones, both gay and straight, who patiently helped me see how my past positions on these issues were at odds with my values, my aloha, and that they were causing people harm.
When we divide people based on who they are or who they love, all we are doing is adding fuel to the flames that perpetuate bigotry and hatred.
When we deny LGBTQ+ people the basic rights that exist for every American, we are denying their humanity - denying that they are equal. We are also creating a dangerous environment that breeds discrimination and violence.
I look forward to being able to share more of my story and experiences growing up – not as an excuse, but in the hopes that it may inspire others to truly live aloha; to love and care for others.
But over the years, I formed my own opinions based on my life experience that changed my views – at a personal level in having aloha, love, for all people, and ensuring that every American, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity, is treated equally under the law.
While many Americans may relate to growing up in a conservative home, my story is a little different because my father was very outspoken. He was an activist who was fighting against gay rights and marriage equality in Hawaii – and at that time, I forcefully defended him.
But I also grew up in a socially conservative household, where I was raised to believe that marriage should only be between a man and a woman. For a period of my life I didn’t see the contradiction in those beliefs.
I grew up knowing that every person is a child of God, and equally loved by God. I have always believed in the fundamental rights and equality of all people.
That cannot happen, because every single American deserves to be treated equally – by their fellow Americans and under the law. I will continue to fight for LGBTQ+ people, whether they’re in school or serving in uniform, trying to get healthcare, or taking care of their family.
I know that LGBTQ+ people still struggle, are still facing discrimination, are still facing abuse and still fear that their hard-won rights are going to be taken away by people who hold views like I used to.
My views have changed significantly since then, and my record in Congress over the last 6 years reflects what is in my heart: A strong and ongoing commitment to fighting for LGBTQ+ rights.
Many years ago, I apologized for my words and, more importantly, for the negative impact that they had. I sincerely repeat my apology today.
Aloha. In my past, I said and believed things that were wrong, and worse, hurtful to people in the LGBTQ+ community and their loved ones. I’m deeply sorry for having said and believed them. https://t.co/BWlOBk9ZnN
Purdue Pharma knew about the addictive nature of their drugs and instructed executives to try to push blame on those who had become addicted, instead of taking accountability for fueling the #opioidcrisis. We must hold them accountable for their crimes. https://t.co/pB5OR4FFAY

The hysterical reaction to the decision to withdraw troops from Syria is astonishing &amp; shows just how attached to war some are. Lindsey Graham &amp; others want us to continue our regime change war in Syria and to go to war with Iran. That’s why they’re so upset.
The underlying problem is that for too long our leaders have had no clear direction or objective when it comes to foreign policy.  So without a clear mission and objective, it’s impossible to know whether any particular decision will help us achieve that mission.
We need to get our troops out of Syria ASAP, but it must be done responsibly. Turkey will see this as an invitation to invade northern Syria, decimate our Kurdish allies, &amp; strengthen jihadists like AQ/ISIS/etc, undermining our national security and causing more suffering.
On the House floor, just voted to pass #FirstStepAct - overwhelming bipartisan support. There is more to be done, but this is a big deal, thanks to the many hands who made this possible! @cut_50

Donald Trump weakly submits that our country must do Saudi Arabia's  bidding or, absurdly, our economy &amp; national security interests will be damaged. He ridiculously calls his policy of submissiveness to Saudi Arabia "America first"--when it's obviously “Saudi Arabia first.”(2/6)
Aloha means love—including love for others, our country and our values. Sometimes aloha manifests as righteous anger—like the anger we feel when our president portrays our country as Saudi Arabia’s slave. (1/6)

Saudi-US coalition air strikes and blockade in Yemen is causing the worst famine in 100 years. Where is the moral outrage and condemnation over our complicity in the death and suffering of millions of Yemeni civilians? https://t.co/MtaYcxvGud
We should condemn Saudi Arabia for Khashoggi’s murder - but where is the outrage over Saudi-U.S. coalition’s murder of tens of thousands of Yemeni children through starvation and bombing? Are their lives worth nothing?
@JTaamu10 @PeterBBoylan Congrats Jordan! We are proud of you
Hawaii’s tourism industry is booming. But too many of our working people are forced to work two or three jobs just to survive and make ends meet. I stand with @uniteherehawaii brothers and sisters who are fighting for a living wage and safe working conditions. #1Job https://t.co/f3h48jOFcw
Trump’s doctrine of economics/foreign/domestic policy: The only thing that matters is money. Do whatever it takes to get it. If it means killing children/civilians in other parts of the world, so be it. If it’s incarcerating people of color so private prisons profit, so be it.
It is especially grotesque that Trump/Pence/Haley say the US should support killing innocent children/civilians in Yemen (and elsewhere) because it's good for our economy. If the only way our leaders can create American jobs is by sacrificing our souls, then we need new leaders.
Yes! We passed this legislation through the House with strong bipartisan support - for so many reasons, it’s the right thing to do. The Senate needs to act with a sense of urgency and pass the #FirstStepAct now. https://t.co/uowf0YdlE3
Hemp is an incredibly versatile and environmentally restorative crop that has great potential - to make things like clothing, paper, houses and more. We must eliminate the obstacles blocking farmers and innovators from pursuing these opportunities.		https://t.co/vrSjce36Um

Should’ve done this sooner; it may be too late. Recent reports indicate al-Qaeda is doing all they can, including blowing up bridges &amp; executing civilians &amp; fighters who try to escape, so they can keep them in Idlib and use them as human shields.

@realDonaldTrump has not learned from our failed history in Iraq and Libya.	 	Instead, his Administration continues to bolster al-Qaeda, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), &amp; “rebel” allies instead of focusing on eliminating terrorist factions, protecting civilians, &amp; peace
@realDonaldTrump has shown no leadership to find a peaceful resolution; instead he’s added fuel to the fire &amp; escalated an already devastating situation. He’s failed to take action against al-Qaeda in Syria, allowing al-Qaeda &amp; other terrorist groups to take control of Idlib.
With @UN supervision and support by the US and neighboring countries, UN Envoy Staffan de Mistura’s proposal could drastically reduce the number of casualties and allow civilians to clear the city before the brutal war for control of Idlib begins.
Syria is once again faced with an inevitable battle and tragedy — this time in Idlib, a northwestern Syrian city that is a major al-Qaeda stronghold. In order to save Syrian lives, Trump must support UN-proposed safe corridor so civilians can evacuate  https://t.co/gwa159PXzm

@obelau24 @ColleenHanabusa @RepHanabusa Yes.  Colleen and I put out an official statement weeks ago urging Governor Ige to sign this bill into law (https://t.co/j58DKMwof1).  She is a co-sponsor of my bill, the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act.
Yet another reason I'm supporting @ColleenHanabusa for Governor. Hawaii needs bold leadership at the helm of our state. Colleen is a co-sponsor of my bill HR1227 to end the Federal Marijuana Prohibition. As Governor, she would've signed this bill into law.
It's too late for the State Legislature to call a special session to override the Governor's veto. The people of Hawaii are forced to wait another year for the possibility of relief. Gov Ige's veto will undoubtedly lead to more opioid-related addiction &amp; death in our state.
But multiple studies and statistics show that in states where medical marijuana is legal, there have been significant decreases in opioid addiction and opioid-related deaths. https://t.co/B4tJ80Niz7
Gov Ige vetoed the bill saying people need to go thru bureaucratic red-tape &amp; apply for approval from HI Dept of Health instead - knowing DOH won't approve because they don't think there's evidence that medical marijuana can effectively help those suffering from opioid addiction.
.@GovHawaii vetoed SB2407 which would've allowed Hawaii patients to use medical marijuana to treat opioid addiction - a shocking decision given there are 191 drug-related deaths per year and almost 500,000 active opioid prescriptions in Hawai'i. https://t.co/oSSIThW7T6

Hawaii is on the front lines of the opioid epidemic:191 drug related deaths per year &amp; nearly 500,000 active opioid prescriptions, enough for a third of our state. SB 2407 would provide access to medical marijuana to help them get off opioids. But @GovHawaii says he will veto.

Question: What is your favorite marine animal?
“My husband proposed to me over his surfboard while we were out in the water at one of our favorite surf spots. The sun was setting, no one else was out, and love was in the air!”
Question: What is your favorite memory of the ocean?
“Here are some easy things we can all do: Recycle, walk, ride your bike, carpool, stop using single-use plastics, and avoid toxic sunscreens that kill our coral reefs."
Question: What can people do right now to help?
"Protecting our water is not a partisan political issue. It is vitally important to all people and living beings everywhere. Water is life—we can’t survive without it. Congress needs to work together to pass legislation to protect our oceans."
Question: What is the role of Congress in protecting our oceans?
“It’s not too late, but we can’t wait for the tide to change. Actions we take every day affect the air we breathe, food we eat, water we drink, and the land and oceans all around us. The people at today's #MarchForTheOcean understand this and are speaking up.”
Question: Do you think it is too late to save our oceans?
"The greatest threat to our oceans is if we fail to act on climate change. Ocean temperatures are rising, pollution riddles our waters, coral reefs are dying off and marine life are being killed. I introduced the OFF Act to stop fossil fuels from polluting our oceans."
Question: What do you think is the greatest threat to our oceans?

We need to investigate the failures that occurred here, causing such massive loss of life in the days/weeks/months after the hurricanes hit. It is outrageous that there was not a house-to-house rescue/recovery effort, esp in rural communities, leaving many dead and undiscovered.

We must be willing to meet with adversaries or leaders of nations who aren't our allies to further the cause of peace. I strongly urge @realDonaldTrump to engage in direct talks with #NorthKorea's Kim Jong Un without preconditions. The stakes are high &amp; there is no time to waste.
The seriousness of North Korea's nuclear threat to the American people cannot be overstated. The need for direct talks between Trump and Kim is critical and urgent to peacefully negotiate denuclearization of #NorthKorea, remove nuclear threat, and avoid all-out catastrophic war.
I strongly urge Congress to consider the serious consequences of Section 1225 which would authorize any or all of these actions. Congress must not cede its authority to declare war to the Administration. I urge my colleagues to vote YES on my amendment to strip Sec1225 from #NDAA
Without a clear objective, you end up in endless war. So what is the objective of #NDAA Section 1225 authorizing war to ‘counter Iran’? Is it regime change in Iran? Regime change in Syria? More war in Syria? Yemen?
For too long, the U.S. has engaged in military adventurism and interventionist wars, sending our troops overseas, with no clear objective or end state. ‘Countering Iran’ is not an end state that our military or diplomats can achieve.
Rather than dumping trillions more dollars into more interventionist regime change wars, we should be using our precious resources to invest in our communities here at home - providing clean water, rebuilding infrastructure, improving education, housing, healthcare &amp; more
Im urging my colleagues to vote YES on the Gabbard amendment that will be up for a vote today in the House which will simply strip Section 1225 from the #NDAA - upholding our constitutional responsibility and preventing this blank check for endless war from becoming law.
Authorizing Section 1225 gives the Trump Administration total authority to keep deploying our troops to the Middle East as long as they want to, without any clear objective and without congressional authorization. This puts us on a dangerous path to endless war.
#Ndaa Section 1225 gives after-the-fact license to continuing U.S. military actions in Yemen supporting Saudi Arabia which have resulted in mass starvation, tens of thousands of dead civilians, and blockades causing one of the worst humanitarian disasters in history.
My amendment upholds Congress’s constitutional responsibility to declare war, and stops this #NDAA provision that sidelines the American people and cedes congressional authority to warhawks like John Bolton, Mike Pompeo, and Nikki Haley
In just a couple hours there will be a vote on the House floor on my amendment to strip the #NDAA of a provision that authorizes our military to go to war with Iran, without limits, and without any constitutionally required declaration of war by Congress or debate.
Next step for the the #FirstStepAct is to get the Senate to pass this bill with similar overwhelming bipartisan support as we saw in the House last night.
Last night I proudly cast my vote for the bipartisan #FirstStepAct which will begin long-overdue #PrisonReform. This will make a real difference in people's lives, now &amp; in the future. Thanks to my friends @RepJeffries @RepDougCollins @VanJones68 &amp; @cut_50 for their leadership!

According to the National Institute of Justice, three out of every four people who spend time in prison will be rearrested for a new crime within five years. The #FIRSTSTEPAct is our opportunity to make real, bipartisan progress on reforming the criminal justice system right now. https://t.co/u0NtdpRHNB
Real change requires people coming together and taking action. #FIRSTSTEPAct will come before Congress tomorrow, with bipartisan support. But some are putting politics before the well-being of people, and opposing this. Urge Congress to vote YES for #prisonreform tomorrow.
Prisons are overcrowded, and they’re costing Americans big time -- America pays more than $80 billion a year to be exact. #FIRSTSTEPAct ensures pre-release halfway houses or home confinement is available and gives people tools to reenter society &amp; end cycle of recidivism.
The #FIRSTSTEPAct makes sure that prisoners are treated, assessed, and rehabilitated with policies that are based on evidence, not personal or institutional bias.
The #FIRSTSTEPAct uses evidence-based approaches that have already been proven to help states like Texas, Alabama and Alaska reduce crime, keep families together, and shrink prison populations, reducing cost to taxpayers.
Formerly incarcerated people face huge legal obstacles to finding employment and housing after release. Rejoining society is often too difficult, leading to many ending up back behind bars. This leaves broken families in its wake. We need #prisonreform now.
One piece of legislation won’t fix every problem in our #criminaljustice system. The #FIRSTSTEPAct is the common ground that exists today where we can get something good done now that will have a direct effect on people’s lives, while we continue to work toward #prisonreform.
Too many people get stuck in our broken criminal justice system and never make it out. We can’t take an all or nothing approach to reform while so many people and families suffer under the status quo. The #FIRSTSTEPAct is the first step towards comprehensive #prisonreform.
According to the National Institute of Justice, three out of every four people who spend time in prison will be rearrested within five years. The #FIRSTSTEPAct can begin to change this. #prisonreform
In hyper-partisan Washington, passing bipartisan legislation is rare. But one thing that has brought Ds and Rs together is the need to fix our criminal justice system. Tomorrow we can begin to do that by passing the #FIRSTSTEPAct in the House. #prisonreform
We still need sentencing reform, but we can’t take an all-or-nothing approach on #prisonreform. We need to focus on the changes we can make today, and the #FIRSTSTEPAct is one of those changes.
The #FIRSTSTEPAct is an opportunity to make meaningful, positive policy changes on #prisonreform that work for the people of Hawaiʻi and the country at-large.
We can no longer afford to maintain the conditions of a broken system. We spend more than $80 billion a year locking up 2.3 million people—more than any country on earth. I support the #FIRSTSTEPAct and ask you to stand with me for real positive change.
Over 70 organizations like @cut_50 support the #FIRSTSTEPAct as they work to reduce our nation's prison population of 2.3M people. This bipartisan bill is an important first step to achieving comprehensive criminal justice &amp; sentencing reform #prisonreform https://t.co/5PE2wEGXxK

We can create the momentum needed to bring this tragic, expensive, and deadly opioid crisis to a halt, but we need everyone's support. Call, text, tweet—do whatever it takes to get the word out. Big Pharma is going to come at us with everything they’ve got—we need to fight back.
Have drug companies reimburse the cost of the crisis—$78 billion a year, according to the CDC. Multi-billion dollar profits from a prescription drug trade that results in death and human suffering should be appropriated to solve the crisis they helped create.
Hold top company executives criminally liable for the crisis. This isn’t about escalating the so-called “War on Drugs.” It’s about restoring justice to a criminal justice system that has been out of whack punishing the wrong people for generations.
Prohibit and penalize the false marketing and distribution of opioids. Companies like Purdue Pharma, the makers of OxyContin, knew about the dangerous and addictive nature of their drugs but did nothing to inform doctors, pharmacists, or the public.
I'm going into this weekend resolved and committed to tackling the opioid crisis. I flew home to Hawaiʻi after introducing the Opioid Crisis Accountability Act, the companion bill to @BernieSanders' opioid bill. It’s time to end the opioid crisis—here’s how we’re going to do it:

Trump proudly said: "When I make promises, I keep them." But what about the US, who he supposedly represents? The United States made a promise in that agreement with Iran, UK, France, Germany, Russia, and China. Trump has now broken that promise, undermining U.S. credibility.
Why should any ally or adversary believe anything the US says? Why should they trust we will keep our word? Trump has completely undermined the opportunity to prevent conflicts &amp; war through negotiation and agreement, by ripping up the agreement the US made with Iran &amp; allies
Trump's message to Iran, NK, &amp; world: It's ok to sign an agreement, then rip it up down the road. Kim Jong-un will say: "Why should I trust the U.S. to adhere to an agreement with North Korea when you did not adhere to the agreement with Iran, even though Iran was in compliance?"
So Trump has increased likelihood of war with Iran &amp; has undermined the critical negotiations to denuclearize North Korea - a country that already has nuclear weapons that threaten the people of Hawaii and this country.
The Iran deal has serious flaws, but it would be better to have this deal in place and address other issues outside of the deal, because without it, the alternative is a war against Iran to prevent them from developing a nuclear weapon.
President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran Nuclear Deal dangerously damages our country’s credibility and undermines the safety &amp; security of the American people.

The people of Hawai‘i know why it's so important that President Trump's meeting with Kim Jong Un move forward without delay—using every diplomatic tool at our disposal—in order to denuclearize North Korea, finally end the Korean War, and bring us closer to peace.
They believe direct talks should not occur or that there should be preconditions before agreeing to just have the conversation. The people of Hawai‘i know firsthand what it's like to live under the threat of an attack from North Korea at any time.
Nothing is more important to the people of America than peace. Unfortunately, there are some who don't understand the urgency of the situation or the seriousness of the nuclear threats that exist for the people of Hawai‘i and this country.

Defense Sec. Mattis called the threat posed by a Korean War the “worst kind of fighting in most people's lifetimes.” We're one step closer to mitigating that threat—I ask for your help in supporting direct talks b/w Trump &amp; Kim to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula &amp; secure peace.
4) Urging the president, our international partners, and United Nations members to keep up the economic and diplomatic pressure until North Korea is rid of its nuclear, chemical, biological, and radiological weapons programs.
3) Urging the president, Kim Jong-Un, and regional leaders to engage in direct diplomacy that exhausts all non-military policy tools before any use of military force.
2) Reaffirming our commitment to peace, diplomatic negotiation, and the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea.
1) Welcoming the United States-North Korea summit that will follow the historic North-South summit that just occurred.
I've introduced a bipartisan resolution reaffirming our commitment to peace, diplomacy, and the complete, irreversible denuclearization of North Korea. My resolution calls for taking these four critical steps:
Water is life. We can all agree that protecting our clean water resources, updating aged water and sewer infrastructure to prevent lead and other contamination, and maintaining our planet and people's health is a priority shared by people of all backgrounds and beliefs.
We need to move to 100 percent renewable energy as quickly as possible. The #OFFAct gets us there by 2035.
Pruitt has consistently made decisions that harm our environment, wasting taxpayer dollars and putting corporate profits ahead of the well-being of the American people.

Our troops put their lives on the line for our country. Their sacrifice must be honored by sending them on missions worthy of their sacrifice; not interventionist regime change wars that cost our country lives &amp; resources, &amp; increase the suffering of those in countries we attack
U.S. military action in Syria could escalate into a war with Russia and Iran. Russia has already stated they will respond to any U.S. military attack against Syria. Is this our mission? How does going to war with Russia over Syria serve the interests of the American people?
The weaker the Syrian government and military are, the more dependent they will be on assistance from Russia and Iran, strengthening their positions and power in Syria. Is that our mission? Does that serve the interests of the American people?
Actions that weaken/cripple the Syrian military result in greater instability, more suffering of Syrian ppl, &amp;  strengthen terrorist groups like al-Qaeda, ISIS, Army of Islam, etc. who are trying to topple the gvmnt. Is that our mission? Does this help Syrian or American ppl?
Our actions in Syria must be based on strategy, which is based on what our mission actually is. What are we trying to achieve? The neocons/neolibs calling on Trump to attack Syria either don't know what the mission is or are pursuing a mission that is contrary to U.S. interests.
As a soldier, I know that the most basic requirement before taking military action is that you must have a clear, achievable objective, &amp; a strategy to achieve it. You must analyze the situation, know what the risks are, &amp; what the cost, consequences of your actions will be
BREAKING: Tulsi Gabbard demands answers from Defense Secretary James Mattis on attacking Syria	https://t.co/4157dPGa7m
@realDonaldTrump Resist the loud and bloody calls for more war from the neocons and warhawks, and instead wield the power of the Presidency to help bring peace to the people of Syria, their devastated country, and the region. #peaceforsyria
Bottom line: If our desire is for peace and stability in Syria so that refugees can return home &amp; they can begin to rebuild their homes and lives, then we should work for peace rather than expanding and escalating the war thru a U.S. military attack against Syria. #peaceforsyria
@realDonaldTrump If you are truly concerned about the suffering of the Syrian people, you must do all you can to bring about peace. Attacking Syria will escalate the war, increase the suffering of the Syrian people, cause more death, &amp; less resources for Americans here at home.
By launching a U.S. military attack against Syria, terrorist groups like al-Qaeda, ISIS, Jaysh al-Islam, etc, will be reinvigorated &amp; resurrected in their quest to topple the government &amp; establish a caliphate. This creates a greater threat to America &amp; hell for the Syrian people
The people of Syria want peace more than anything in the world. Dropping bombs on Syria will not bring their war-torn country any closer to peace. It will escalate and prolong the war, resulting in more senseless death, destruction, suffering, and refugees.
Our unfortunate and brutal history of waging regime change wars has failed. Interventions in Iraq and Libya caused death, destruction, and human suffering. We have neglected our own communities. Military action should be the last resort, not our first.

US intervention in Yemen has not lessened the suffering of the Yemeni people; US bombs have not brought about peace. Yemeni deaths, suffering and hardship continues to increase. Washington needs to stop bowing to Saudi Arabia's wishes. Congress needs to end this madness now.
The U.S. has been supporting Saudi Arabia illegally in this war for years, without authorization from Congress, required by the War Powers Act. Saudi Arabia wouldn't have been able to continue this years-long war &amp; their horrific war crimes without US logistics support &amp; US bombs
In addition to Trump's massive sale of advanced weapons to Saudi Arabia, US military shares intel and refuels Saudi war planes that drop US bombs that kill thousands of Yemeni civilians. Saudi blockade causes starvation &amp; the fastest-growing cholera epidemic ever.
Once again Congress fails to fulfill its constitutional duty.  In a shameful bipartisan vote today, the US Senate failed to end US support for Saudi Arabia’s proxy war against Iran in Yemen that has caused devastating destruction, death, and suffering.

Too many members of Congress, from both parties, are listening to the banks and their lobbyists who write big checks to their campaigns, rather than listening to the voices of the American people who suffer as a result. This is corrupt and wrong.
People are demanding accountability, that Congress break up the big banks and hold them accountable for their risky behavior that devastated people’s lives and caused our economy to crash.
Millions of Americans have struggled since the 2008 Recession, but Wall Street hasn’t. The banks that were too big to fail then are even bigger today. The people who lost their homes, jobs and life savings were not bailed out like the banks were.
@Tim_Canova Thanks @Tim_Canova - there is much more to be done. This bill was crafted in a very narrow and specific way to urgently hack-proof our 2018 elections &amp; deal with the vulnerabilities that exist in 35 states that don't have any form of voter-verified paper record of votes cast.
Instead of deregulating Wall Street banks that are bigger today than in 2008 when they were 'too big to fail', we should #reinstateGlassSteagal &amp; strengthen oversight and regulations, and hold those responsible accountable for the crimes they committed against the American people
The Senate's passage today of the #BankLobbyistAct with bipartisan support is a disgrace &amp; a slap in the face to all whose lives were devastated by the 2008 financial crisis. This bill further deregulates Wall Street big banks &amp; increases the risk of yet another financial crisis.

Add your name to my petition calling for direct talks with North Korea: https://t.co/3ahI5l5rYa
We must act now - President Trump must engage in talks directly with Kim Jong Un, and begin the negotiations that can lead us down a peaceful path toward eliminating this nuclear threat from North Korea.
Military leaders have spelled out in detail how a war with North Korea would be catastrophic. Today’s news should give us hope that peace is possible.
This is an affirmation of the diplomatic progress we can make towards peace when we are willing to directly negotiate without preconditions, do not pursue counterproductive regime change policies, and instead focus on how we can achieve peace.
South Korea’s national security chief said, “North Korea has no reason to possess nuclear weapons when military threats are resolved, and when North Korea’s regime is guaranteed.”
Just this morning, direct talks between North &amp; South Korea indicated that with U.S. participation, we can achieve the following:		-Nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula	-Normalizing relations between the U.S. &amp; North Korea	-Suspension of nuclear and ballistic missile tests
In recent months, and particularly following the false missile alert in Hawaiʻi earlier this year, the rest of the country has begun to understand the reality that the people of Hawaiʻi have known all too well for far too long.
For years, I’ve been speaking out about the ever-increasing nuclear threat coming from North Korea and calling for direct talks to find a peaceful resolution to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.
The breaking diplomatic news coming out of the Korean Peninsula today further affirms what I have been calling for: the United States must engage in diplomatic talks with North Korea now. (Thread) https://t.co/9YwFDRzxsC

I introduced a bill with a simple solution: the Securing America’s Elections Act (HR5147) would mandate paper ballots/paper ballot backups for Federal elections across the country to ensure there is an audible voter-verified paper record, to protect the integrity of our elections
Serious vulnerabilities in our elections systems have been exposed. Even with stronger cybersecurity, the reality is these systems can be hacked. We must counter those vulnerabilities. Voter-verified paper ballot/paper back-ups are a commonsense way to hack-proof our elections.

6. Let’s continue to do everything we can to protect our precious water resources and stop the extraction of dangerous fossil fuels. Let’s invest in renewable energy. Support the #OFFAct. Water is Life! https://t.co/aTjmCStGde
5. We must listen to native communities, whose sovereignty was violated with #DAPL construction. Whether we fight for clean water at Standing Rock, in Flint, Red Hill in Hawaiʻi or anywhere else, everyone’s voice should matter.
4. The fact that #DAPL had 5 oil spills in its first 6 months of operation should surprise no one. There is no clean or completely safe way to extract+transport fossil fuels. The science is clear. We need to cease fossil fuel production immediately &amp; move to 100% renewable energy
3. The EIS was abandoned not long after President Trump took office, but water protectors have continued to organize. The Native Nations March, March for Science, People’s Climate March, and countless local efforts show a new path forward for putting people before profits.
2. Here’s a video we recorded in early December 2016, when I traveled to Standing Rock with thousands of veterans in support of the water protectors. The Army Corps had denied the easement then, instead ordering an environmental impact statement, or EIS. https://t.co/Q9IwtluLQ6

Congress must do the right thing and come together with a bipartisan, permanent fix to guarantee #DREAMers a future in the United States.
The opportunity and freedom of DACA have allowed DREAMers, including more than 600 in Hawaiʻi, to go to college, find a job, support their family, serve their country, and live free from the constant fear of deportation. Congress must enact a permanent, bipartisan solution now.
The #OFFAct immediately ends federal permitting for new fossil fuel projects. That means no offshore drilling, no pipelines, no more polluting water and the environment. We must reach 100 percent renewable energy by 2035.
Effective negotiations to denuclearize North Korea require an end to our failed and counterproductive regime change war policy. The people of Hawaiʻi and this country want peace.
@J_Towles Thank you for your service, on many fronts.

Our leaders must take the nuclear threat from North Korea seriously. This is not a game. The prospect of intentional or unintentional nuclear war, which we experienced many times in the Cold War, shows why we must end our regime change policies and work for peace.
The U.S. has a history of regime change, like overthrowing Gaddafi in Libya after promising we wouldn't if he gave up his nuclear weapons. That is the reason why Kim Jong-un develops them - as the only deterrent keeping us from toppling his regime like we have in other countries.
We must engage in direct talks with North Korea to achieve peace. Unrealistic preconditions have failed us for decades. We need to de-escalate the nuclear crisis with the ultimate goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.
Instead of cutting renewable energy projects like the White House proposed, we should invest in the technology of the future like Kauaʻi has to lower energy rates and stop burning fossil fuel. 100% renewable energy by 2035 is possible with the #OFFAct. https://t.co/cKmoolbpxK

The Trafficking Survivors Relief Act is a common sense criminal justice reform. The current system puts survivors at risk of suffering further abuse, trauma, and recidivism by charging them for non-violent crimes they were forced to commit. We must empower recoveries instead.
S.534, the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act will begin the healing process for survivors and help prevent further abuse of children by monsters like Larry Nassar. We must fight assault, abuse, and harassment wherever they occur.

Regime change war policy is the reason why North Korea sees nuclear weapons as their only deterrent from U.S.-led regime change. They've seen what we did in Iraq and in Libya. We must end these policies and engage in direct talks to peacefully de-escalate the nuclear crisis.
Hawaii's false missile alert recalls the false alarms that brought the U.S. and Soviet Union minutes away from nuclear war on multiple occasions. That's what makes peace, de-escalating the crisis with North Korea, and ultimately denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula so critical.
The people of Hawaiʻi deserve answers to how the false missile alert occurred, who is being held accountable, and what is being done to prevent it from happening again.

I am calling for direct talks to explore and maximize all peaceful avenues towards finding a path to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, prevent a catastrophic war, and eliminate this nuclear threat that exists.
President Trump needs to take North Korea's nuclear threat seriously and begin direct negotiations to make it so the people of Hawaiʻi and this country don’t have to live under this dark shadow of a potential nuclear attack and war.
Failed negotiations, unrealistic preconditions, as well as the long-held U.S. foreign policy of regime change has led North Korea to develop and tighten their grip on nuclear weapons because they see that as the only deterrent to the U.S. leading an effort to topple their regime.
The people of Hawaiʻi are paying the price for decades of failed leadership from both Democrat and Republican administrations on allowing North Korea's nuclear capability to increase, to the point where we sit here today under threat of nuclear attack.
I urge the #DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee to adopt the #UnityReformCommission recommendations. We must focus on how best the DNC can serve the American people.
It is critical that we end our policies of regime change wars to provide that credible guarantee that the United States is not going to go in and topple the North Korean regime so that conversations can begin toward denuclearization. https://t.co/NH8DZ05C4E
Hawai‘i has the highest per-capita rate of homelessness in the country. We must address the soaring cost of living and extreme shortages of truly affordable housing in our state and across America.
Civil rights, fair housing, consumer, and community organizations in Hawai‘i and across the country opposed the Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act. Congress set up working families to once again take the fall for irresponsible lenders and "too big to fail" banks.
Fair housing laws and protections against discriminatory lending are essential, especially after the 2008 financial crisis, but Congress just passed a Wall Street-backed bill to allow discrimination against low-income and minority Americans to persist.
#HR1227 decriminalizes marijuana and removes it from the federal controlled substances list. The American people want common sense criminal justice reform - our bipartisan legislation kickstarts that conversation. https://t.co/CG0hzqQDU7
Hawaii’s false alarm puts a spotlight on intentional+unintentional war. There are many examples of the Soviet Union-U.S. being seconds away from nuclear war. The warning system must be fixed, but the larger issue that brought about the alarm is finding a path to denuclearization.
Direct talks with North Korea must begin without preconditions. We have no time to waste. Unrealistic preconditions have failed to decrease the nuclear threat for decades - talking is the first step toward denuclearization and peace.
Regime change war policy is the reason why North Korea sees nuclear weapons as their only deterrent from U.S.-led regime change. We need immediate and direct talks promoting de-escalation and peace.
This nuclear threat coming from North Korea must be taken seriously. President Trump needs to talk directly with Kim Jong-un and seek a path to peace. https://t.co/v3kSGBFgQj
The practice of spending taxpayer dollars to fund counterproductive regime change wars must end. It is long overdue we pass the Stop Arming Terrorists Act to prevent terrorist groups like al-Qaeda or state sponsors like Saudi Arabia from receiving cash, weapons, or intelligence.
Regime change has failed. Evidence on the ground shows that al-Qaeda and affiliated terrorist groups have long since taken over or co-opted other militants in Syria to fight for them. We must learn from our mistakes in Iraq &amp; Libya and oppose this policy. https://t.co/B5NZzhmKww
The American people's support for #NetNeutrality is clear. Congress must empower their voices, protect their rights to fairness and equality, and reject the FCC's corporate-backed vote.

North Korean state media highlights U.S. regime change policies - deposing Gaddafi in Libya, Hussein in Iraq, &amp; the CIA-led regime change war in Syria - to justify their nuclear weapons. Gaddafi was promised he wouldn't be deposed if he gave his up, he did, we deposed him anyway.
This is not about politics. This is about fighting for peace so that the people of Hawaiʻi and this country do not have to live under this shadow of nuclear war. https://t.co/spfyfnoKTm
I am not satisfied with how people have been held accountable. I’m looking forward to a full investigation to see all the layers of what went wrong from the person who pushed the wrong button to everything that resulted in such a delayed correction going to the people of Hawaiʻi.
Our leaders have set unrealistic preconditions to negotiate with North Korea for decades. If we set a precondition that Kim Jong-un must get rid of his nuclear weapons, there would be nothing to negotiate. We need to invite North Korea to the table and talk about peace.
It was a mistake for the United States to take out Gaddafi and Hussein. Libya and Iraq are still reeling from the effects of our attacks. We need to learn from our mistakes, end our policy of regime change, and implement a policy of de-escalation and peace.
Regime change war policy is the reason why North Korea sees nuclear weapons as their only deterrent from a U.S.-led attack. Kim Jong-un sees what the U.S. has done to Gaddafi in Libya, Saddam Hussein in Iraq, and the effort underway to decertify the nuclear deal with Iran.
We have seen this nuclear threat during the Cold War when the Soviet Union and the US were seconds away from an attack. Peace with North Korea requires immediate and direct talks without preconditions. https://t.co/NHURYyGajN

We need to send a credible message that we're not interested in overthrowing your government, we're interested in removing this nuclear threat from our country and the world.
I've been calling on President Trump to directly negotiate with North Korea without preconditions, to sit across the table from Kim Jong-un, work out the differences so that we can build a pathway towards denuclearization to remove this threat.
When the people of Hawaiʻi got this message yesterday, they were literally going through this feeling of "I've got minutes to find my loved ones, to say my last goodbyes, to figure out where could I possibly find shelter that would protect me from a nuclear attack." https://t.co/5Qb7OteSpP
The people of Hawaiʻi should never have had to go through this. The people of America should not be faced with this threat right now. We need peace - not political bickering. We have to talk to North Korea and find a peaceful path to get rid of this nuclear threat.
Donald Trump is taking too long. Now is not the time for posturing. He must take this threat seriously and begin direct talks with North Korea, without preconditions, to de-escalate and denuclearize the Korean peninsula. There is no time to waste.
Our leaders have failed us for decades, refused to take this threat seriously and prevent a nuclear North Korea, and the people of Hawaiʻi are now paying the price.
Everyone in American needs to understand that if you had to go through this, you would be as angry as I am - I have been talking about the seriousness of this threat for years.
The people of Hawaiʻi experienced that in 15 minutes they and their families are going to be dead. Gone. That's what they just went through.
Over a million of Hawaii's people were faced with the immediate reality of having 15 minutes to find a place to "take shelter," wondering where do I go? What shelter is going to protect me &amp; my family from a nuclear bomb?! But there’s nowhere to go, nowhere to hide.
The people of Hawaiʻi just got a sense of the stark reality of what a nuclear strike on Hawaiʻi would be. Cell phones all across Hawaiʻi got a message saying a ballistic missile is incoming, take shelter.

Every member of Congress should take up the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act to remove marijuana from the list of federally controlled substances. Anything less compromises the safety and well-being of the people who need our protection the most.
States with medical marijuana have seen a correlating drop in opioid-related deaths. Sessions' decision will exacerbate an inhumane, ineffective system that tears families apart. We need criminal justice reform that reduces recidivism and the share of people that we lock up.
Millions of people have been arrested for possession or use of marijuana, incarcerated without the means to make bail, and mired in a hopelessly backlogged court system that punishes non-violent offenders with felonies and years behind bars.
Sessions’ actions to protect the bottom lines of the for-profit private prison industry, and Big Pharma whose opioids and drugs flourish in part due to the marijuana prohibition, while trampling on states' rights and turning everyday Americans into criminals is an injustice.
I’ve met with parents of children with epilepsy, cancer, and other serious and chronic conditions, who are fighting for greater research and legal use of medical marijuana, and who have rallied behind my bill H.R. 1227, the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act.
Veterans suffering from invisible wounds like Post-Traumatic Stress and chronic pain, or with addiction to opioids, deserve our commitment to researching every possible treatment to help them, and Sessions is failing them.
Let’s be clear about who Sessions’ decision will hurt. More than eighty percent of veterans in the American Legion voted two months ago in favor of a resolution legalizing medical marijuana at the federal level.

Authorizing additional relief funding for #PuertoRico and #USVI must be among our top priorities. Housing, hospitals, schools, roads, water, and the environment all urgently need our attention. 1.5 million are still without electricity. Hundreds of thousands without clean water.
Fully funding #CHIP fulfills a promise the federal government has made to our nation's children and their families each year since this bipartisan program was first authorized two decades ago. Nine million children are depending on us to keep that promise.
We will not defer a permanent solution for Dreamers any longer, and we will not use people as bargaining chips. Congress must pass a clean #DreamActNow.

It is obvious that Puerto Rico needs additional relief. It was apparent even before the natural disasters they have suffered this year. Their crisis is ours. I will continue to do everything in my power to deliver justice and aid to our fellow Americans.
The economic, ecological, and humanitarian crises that US citizens of Puerto Rico are dealing with after Irma and Maria cannot be taken without consideration for the Recession, unequal treatment by Washington, and the debt that has been weaponized to wipe out social services.
Puerto Rico has imposed austerity for years at the behest of Wall Street vulture funds. Child poverty rose to ~60%, infrastructure failed, 100+ schools &amp; hospitals closed, foreclosures rose 90% after 2008, median income hovered at $19,000 (compared to the $51K national average).
This is unacceptable, and quite frankly would not be happening if American citizens in Puerto Rico were treated the same as those living in states. The blame for this falls squarely on Washington and Wall Street hedge funds and creditors, not the Puerto Rican people. https://t.co/P5e2LZlhnu

The #GOPTaxScam hands out billions of dollars to the fossil fuel industry at the peril of our planet. The GOP's actions go against everything our scientists, military, and intelligence services have warned us about the threat of climate change and the steps needed to mitigate it.
A Congress that cannot summon the courage to provide health insurance to children or keep its promise to Dreamers but will eagerly cut taxes for corporations &amp; campaign contributors has failed the people. The #GOPTaxScam lays bare the corruption of putting profits before people.
Millions in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands are still without electricity and clean water. Wildfires are raging in California. Congress must double down on federal disaster relief efforts.
The #GOPTaxScam hurts Hawaiʻi, our keiki and kūpuna, our 'āina, veterans, people with student loans, the sick and those suffering from addiction, and our struggling middle class. We need tax reform that works for us, not pay-to-play politicians and their campaign contributors.
We do need real tax reform - but not this partisan #taxscam that was written by lobbyists for the special interests they represent. We need real tax reform that empowers hard working families, and strengthens our economy and our country.
I’m heading to the House floor to vote NO on the tax bill that provides massive PERMANENT breaks to corporations, while providing minor TEMPORARY breaks to some middle class families. Hard working people will pay MORE taxes than they do now, when these cuts expire in 10 yrs.
Republicans made it very clear from the start that "tax reform" was about reimbursing their campaign contributors for bankrolling their reelections.
Our broken campaign finance laws have allowed special interests to corrupt the legislative process, and the American people are paying the price. We must overturn Citizens United.

Their short-sighted leadership over the last 40 years has left the people of Hawai‘i and this country, our homes and communities, and generations to come, under a dark cloud of a nuclear threat from this point forward.
It is a travesty and a total failure of leadership by both Republican and Democrat administrations.
I’ve been raising the issue of the increasing threat from North Korea ever since I came to Congress because the people of Hawai‘i have long known that North Korea's continued growing capabilities put us squarely within range of their intercontinental ballistic missiles.
They’ll be reminded every month, with nuclear warning siren tests, that at any moment we, our children, our families, and our precious aina will be vulnerable to a nuclear attack from North Korea, with mere minutes notice.
December 1, 2017 will forever mark a dark day for Hawai‘i, for our country, and the world. Today marks the first day of a new era, in which the lives and future of the people of our state have indelibly changed.
As we recognize #WorldAIDSDay and the 2017 theme of "right to health", let us resolve ourselves to bring universal healthcare to every American living with HIV. It's time for #MedicareForAll.

But no more absurd than President Trump's tripling down on US support for Saudi Arabia, which continues to spread extreme Wahhabi Salafist ideology around the world, fueling terrorist groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda, all while paying lip service to ‘defeating terrorism’
Ridiculous-Not only did Pakistan give refuge to Bin Laden, responsible for attacks against US on 9/11, Pakistan set free a terrorist who has a $10 million American bounty on his head. Saeed was the mastermind behind the Mumbai attack that killed hundreds, including 6 Americans.
The nuclear threat coming from North Korea is the serious reality that the people of Hawaii face. This is not a game. President Trump must stop his  dangerous rhetoric &amp; negotiate directly with NK to de-escalate &amp; ultimately denuclearize Korean peninsula https://t.co/9Cx0dRRXaF
It's #GivingTuesday, a wonderful time to think about the many ways we can give &amp; serve those in need - give to a non-profit you support, give your time, your energy, your skills, whatever you can, in service to others and our planet.

Repealing #NetNeutrality is just another handout to corporations paid for by average consumers. The freedom and openness of the internet must be preserved.
25,000 Hawai'i children are relying on Congress to extend #CHIP before the end of the year, when our state funding will be totally exhausted. We must reauthorize this program now.
800,000 DREAMers are counting on Congress to act before their DACA expires. We must pass a clean #DreamActNow.
Wall Street used Puerto Rico's debt as leverage while schools and hospitals closed and foreclosures rose even before Hurricane Maria. We must restructure the debt and provide long-term relief to our citizens, many of whom are still struggling without electricity and clean water.
We need to break up the big banks and break their influence over Congress. It's time for a modernized Glass-Steagall Act and real campaign finance reform.
The American people need more protection from the big banks. We will not accept a weakened CFPB that favors Wall Street over the people who bailed them out.
This is why those who adhere to the exclusivist Wahhabi Salafi ideology, promulgated by Saudi Arabia around the world, want to destroy them - because their inclusive, pluralist ideology inspires peace and respect for people of all spiritual paths and practices.
Terrorist groups like ISIS, who adhere to the extreme Wahhabi Salafi ideology, see Sufi Muslims as heretics who must be killed. All over the world and throughout history, Sufis are known as those who are trying to develop their love for God by dancing and singing God’s names.
The tragic terrorist attack in Egypt that took the lives of at least 305 men, women, and children, and injured many others, should serve as a wake up call that the war against jihadists is far from over.

#TaxScam Fact of the Day:	Deductions for state and local taxes are eliminated, meaning the federal government will tax what has already been paid to state and local government.
American citizens in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands still need electricity and clean water. We cannot lose our sense of urgency. Congress must take further action to alleviate this crisis.
Every member of Congress should refuse PAC money. We must devote our energy to solving the problems that affect millions of people, not ignoring those problems to protect corporations' bottom lines.
This legislation will publicize the names of any offending Members of Congress and prohibit non-disclosure agreements when filing a complaint. MoC must be held personally and financially responsible for their transgressions.
I am cosponsoring the ME TOO Act to end taxpayer-funded harassment settlements and overhaul Congress' broken harassment policies. It is time we pursue real justice for victims of sexual harassment, discrimination, and other unacceptable behavior, no matter where it may occur.
My thoughts and prayers are with the U.S. Navy as they continue the rescue effort of three missing service members following an aircraft crash off of Japan. Extremely grateful that eight have already been rescued.
#TaxScam Fact of the Day:	To offset the $1.5 trillion increase in the national deficit, in FY2018 alone there would be $136 billion in cuts to mandatory programs, including $25 billion cut from Medicare.
We should be discussing how to expand internet access to more people, not restrict it to those who can afford to pay more. We need to keep #NetNeutrality.
#TaxScam Fact of the Day:	Teachers' deductions for out of pocket expenses are eliminated, making teachers choose between buying students the supplies they need or supplementing their already meager take-home pay.
While the US now lists North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism, we have supported Saudi Arabia's brutal war in Yemen, which has killed untold civilians, sparked a cholera outbreak, and a famine. We must #StopArmingTerrorists and stop the hypocrisy in our foreign policy.
The aloha spirit is about welcoming your neighbors. Congress should extend this program while we work towards comprehensive immigration reform. #SaveTPS https://t.co/oTJdA7jnXO

#TaxScam Fact of the Day:	While Americans already pay more per capita in healthcare costs than any other major country, this bill eliminates deductions for major medical expenses that 8.8 million people depend on - an attack on the elderly and most vulnerable in our society.
When college debt totals over $1.5 trillion dollars, it isn't a problem of students being irresponsible in taking out loans - it's a problem with the system as a whole.
From Trump University to Betsy DeVos, members of this administration have put a higher premium on personal enrichment than they have on improving our education system to respond to the needs of our students and educators.
Nearly half of all Hawai'i graduates hold some form of student loan debt. These loans keeps people from buying homes, cars, starting families, and growing our economy. We need #CollegeForAll, tuition-free.
#TaxScam Fact of the Day:	12 million students and graduates lose their student loan interest deductions, further burying them in debt that already totals over $1.5 trillion dollars.
The American people have rejected healthcare cuts over and over again. Attempts to hide Medicare cuts in the #TaxReform bill circumvent a debate the GOP clearly does not want to have. Healthcare must be protected.
9 million children rely on #CHIP for their healthcare needs. It is critical that Congress reauthorize it, and push for #MedicareForAll to cover all Americans.
We must break up the big banks that hold so much influence over our economy and our political system.
The military is scaling up their renewable energy use in order to be more secure and save taxpayer dollars. It's an approach that should be replicated across America. https://t.co/N1MwsIUHRb
Solar energy brought a children's hospital in Puerto Rico back online following Hurricane Maria. With that potential for power generation, it is ludicrous that the #TaxScam bill eliminates credits for commercial solar investment.
The American automotive industry has long been a pillar of manufacturing, labor, and ingenuity. Eliminating credits for electric vehicles at the same time that their global demand is growing will hurt innovation, our economy, and our global competitiveness.
The $14 billion in fossil fuel subsidies is government putting its finger on the scale to favor the special interests of a poisonous industry.
#TaxScam Fact of the Day:	Tax credits for electric vehicles and commercial solar investment are eliminated, and wind energy project credits are cut by one-third before they too are phased out. The fossil fuel industry's $14 billion in federal subsidies become permanent.
Immigration is a tremendous economic benefit for Hawai'i and our country as a whole. Passing the #DreamAct will help, but we have much more work left to do.
#DACA has allowed more than 600 people to remain legally in Hawai'i, in many cases the only home they have ever truly known.
#DACA recipients have done everything asked of them. There is bipartisan support for a #CleanDreamAct - it's time for Congress to uphold the promise we made to Dreamers and pass this legislation.

We cannot afford to wait. #DACA recipients in Hawaiʻi and across the country face a future of uncertainty so long as we do not act. It's time to pass a clean #DREAMAct with bipartisan support. #DreamActNow
Individuals and corporations who avoid taxes by hiding their profits in offshore accounts do not need another break. The people that do are the ones relying on programs this #TaxReform bill seeks to eliminate.

Devastated by news of the elementary school shooting in Rancho Tehama today. My sincere thanks to the first responders and officers who were on the scene.
Puerto Rico &amp; USVI recovery, CHIP reauthorization, and a clean DREAM Act for DACA recipients all demand our attention. Neglecting these issues has a material impact on people's lives and livelihoods.
Maui’s 50th Anniversary Vietnam War Commemoration Banquet honored more than 150 Vietnam veterans, their families, and Gold Star families. Every generation of veterans is connected through common sacrifice and service.
Spending time in our community and connecting with constituents is always rewarding. It was great speaking with so many of you in Maui this weekend to discuss the VA, IRS, Social Security, and other important issues.
Women like Ruth April, a 95 year old Marine WWII veteran, have a bond which connects them to the newest generation of service members. We must not overlook the sacrifices made by women in our armed forces, whose service dates back generations.
Reflecting on the 99th Anniversary Commemoration of the End of WWI, we must continue to honor the sacrifices and patriotism of more than 4 million American women and men who served. Let's pass the bipartisan Rehabilitating World War I Memorial Act.

Our alliance with Saudi Arabia contradicts the objectives of our so-called "War on Terror." Saudi's support for Wahhabi Salafist ideology spreads terrorism and undermines national and global security. Foreign policy should not be brokered according to fossil fuel interests.

This year, Wells Fargo paid a $108 million settlement for charging military veterans hidden fees to refinance their mortgages. We have to break up the big banks and reinstate Glass-Steagall to protect veterans, and all consumers, from predatory banking practices. #VeteransDay
Our military is changing, and the VA must change with it. There are 2.2 million female veterans across the US, including 14,000 in Hawai‘i. Join me in supporting the Deborah Sampson Act, which is specifically designed to address the needs of female veterans at the VA #VeteransDay
Throughout history, our nation has upheld policies of unnecessary military escalation in lieu of diplomacy. Putting our military personnel into combat should only be done when absolutely necessary. #VeteransDay
As we observe #VeteransDay, let us reflect on the true cost of war and the military families who end up paying for it. We must do more to improve access to VA healthcare, reintegrate veterans into civilian life, and heed calls for diplomacy before resorting to military action.
Mahalo to all who have sacrificed and worn the uniform, and to those who have put their lives on the line in defense of the freedoms we hold dear. Our nation will always honor your bravery &amp; dedication. #VeteransDay
We should imagine a future of possibility and aspire to solve our biggest challenges with bold ideas. The #OFFAct is more than an idea - it builds on the progress Hawai‘i has made toward 100% clean energy with clear, tangible steps to reach that goal as a nation by 2035.
The situation in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands is the latest example of the failing infrastructure across our country. Whether the damage comes from a hurricane or a corroded lead water pipe, our communities need serious investments to keep people healthy and safe.
Too many members of Congress seem unwilling to consider the full scope of aide required for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands' recovery. We need a total overhaul of infrastructure, from the power grid to water treatment systems to rebuilding the schools wiped out by storms.
Puerto Rico &amp; the U.S. Virgin Islands need massive investments. The longer we delay in sending aid, the more prolonged the recovery becomes.
We should be proactive, not reactive when investing to protect our natural environment and communities on the front lines of climate change.
We've hardly tapped into the potential that green jobs have to boost our economy. With the #OFFAct, we will create millions more while securing a future of energy independence and sustainability.

Our nation's 2.2 million female veterans experience higher rates of post-traumatic stress, military sexual assault, unemployment, and homelessness, but they have less access to the VA than their male counterparts. The Deborah Sampson Act can help fix these fundamental inequities.
Our criminal justice system must prepare those convicted of a crime to lead a successful life once they have paid their debt to society.
There is bipartisan agreement over immigration, criminal justice reform and more. Both parties should work together toward common solutions.
The private prison industry profits off of our broken immigration system. They want to maintain the status quo - it's our job to change it.
Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition will allow greater medical research into treatments for epilepsy, PTSD, addiction, pain relief &amp; more.
Industry giants like Purdue Pharma have played a direct role in the opioid epidemic. They must be held responsible for the harm they've done
Arresting our way out of the opioid epidemic won't work. We must invest in rehabilitation and programs to curb addiction &amp; recidivism rates.
If we cannot afford to care for our military veterans and families when they return home, then we should not be sending them into conflict.
Diplomacy with North Korea remains our best option for national and global security. Military escalation will not solve the nuclear crisis.
We must end our counterproductive regime change policy and instead invest our precious resources here at home. We can't afford to do both.

Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition is critical for research on the correlation between legal access and reduced opioid addiction+overdoses
The US incarcerates the most people on earth, costing taxpayers billions. We need to actively search for effective alternatives to prison.
Private prisons &amp; detention centers hold disproportionate numbers of undocumented people, including minors. We need immigration reform.
The over-criminalization of our society has hurt millions of people and families as well as law enforcement, the judiciary, and our economy.
We need criminal justice reform to reduce mandatory minimums, recidivism rates, and rectify the racist, unjust disparity in sentencing.
Criminal justice reform begins with ending the "War on Drugs", which has wrought irreparable harm upon millions of people and their families
The opioid epidemic directly relates to our fight for #MedicareForAll. Our health is more important than Big Pharma &amp; insurers' bottom lines
Reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act is necessary to ensure that hardworking Americans aren’t responsible for Wall Street’s risky behavior.
At great cost to the American people, corrupt campaign finance laws have allowed big banks to maintain their heavy influence in Congress.
Automatic Voter Registration will increase voter turnout &amp; engage more people in our democracy. We should implement it at the federal level.

The situation in the #USVirginIslands is just as dire as in #PuertoRico. Our vast resources need to be concentrated on helping them rebuild.
The clean energy revolution happening in Hawaiʻi proves not only that a future #OffFossilFuels is possible, but that it's already happening.
Hawaiʻi was the first state to set a 100% clean energy goal &amp; we're already ahead of schedule. On most days Kauaʻi runs on &gt;90% clean energy
This budget cuts taxes for the rich by cutting programs that our elderly, children, vets, &amp; low-income communities rely on to make ends meet

The banking legislation that passed last night is woefully out of touch with what the American people want: real Wall Street accountability.
Last night's Senate vote to put banking interests before consumers is a cover for the fraud we've seen from Wells Fargo, Equifax and others.

We need direct dialogue with #NorthKorea to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the nuclear crisis. Diplomacy is our best option.
Addiction cannot be regarded as a moral failing. Everyone deserves to be treated with aloha and respect, no matter their circumstances.
The #opioidcrisis is the worst drug epidemic in our country's history. We cannot allow Big Pharma to delay Congressional action any longer.
The DEA must be able to take action when opioid distributors break the law. Repealing Marino-Hatch will save lives. #opioidcrisis
We need to reinstate Glass-Steagall. Without separation between investment+commercial banking, Wall Street gambles impact people's savings.

Punitive drug policies exacerbate human trafficking. Victims with an addiction shy away from law enforcement rather than seek their help.
Our criminal justice system punishes people suffering from addiction. Those who enabled their addiction buy political influence and go free.
The pharmaceutical industry has lied to the public for years about the addictiveness of their drugs. They are culpable in the opioid crisis.

Communities in Puerto Rico, Flint, and across the country have been left behind while Democrat &amp; Republican foreign policies cost us dearly.
Our interventionist, counterproductive regime change wars have cost our nation dearly - thousands of lives and trillions of dollars.
We have cash-strapped communities at home that don't have money for infrastructure, but have paid a price for our aggressive foreign policy.
I am deeply concerned by the overextension of our nation's military and will continue to challenge the traditional foreign policy consensus.
The War on Terror directly contradicts this administration's policy towards Saudi Arabia, a primary backer of extremist groups and ideology.
This administration will need to answer why our fallen service members were in Niger, and how their mission fits into the "War on Terror."

It's the end of the weekend for some, but for those in service, retail &amp; more it's another day of work. Workers deserve a $15 minimum wage.

#DACA recipients are not bargaining chips, they are people. There is bipartisan support for the DREAM Act - it's time to bring it to a vote.
Citizens United and the repeal of Glass-Steagall have created a vacuum for Wall Street banks to influence policy and make record profits.
The federal government must take a central role in getting clean water and electricity back to all parts of #PuertoRico and #USVI.

We need a 21st century Glass-Steagall Act, justice and accountability for bankers that has been sorely lacking.
This is out of control. Trump promised to drain the swamp, but he's brought the swamp to the White House, leaving American people to suffer.
Wells Fargo sent 274K into delinquency &amp; 25K had their cars repossessed. Also overcharged military vets for refinanced mortgage loans.
Wells Fargo set up at least 3.5 million fake accounts while at the same time robbing 800,000 customers with secret auto insurance plans.
Experian, the largest credit rating agency, suffered a similar breach in 2015 that compromised the data of 15 million customers.
The Equifax data breach compromised 143M customers’ info while execs sold millions of $ worth of shares before disclosing it to the public.
Fraud &amp; ineptitude have been Wall St trademarks since Glass-Steagall's repeal, leading the American people to deal with a full blown crisis.
#Dreamers have taken an incredible risk by coming out of the shadows to earn protected status - not only for themselves, but their families.

I was proud to help pass 3 bills last week to help educate &amp; bolster law enforcement efforts to fight human trafficking in the US &amp; abroad.
Girls as young as 11 &amp; 13 years old are targeted at schools, malls, and beaches by human traffickers to be coerced into sex work.
Hawaii is America’s gateway to Asia, and in 2010 the FBI freed 400 Thai nationals from a Hawaii farm - the largest case in modern history.
In 2016, the Global Slavery Index estimated that nearly 46 million people across 167 countries were being trafficked.
Purdue &amp; others responsible should be criminally prosecuted for their role in the deaths and ruined lives resulting from their fraudulence.
They use deceptive marketing, false advertising, and lie about the addictive nature of their drugs. Now they’re moving operations overseas.
Purdue Pharma, maker of Oxycontin, &amp; other drug companies have made gross profits off the suffering of millions addicted to opioids &amp; heroin
In one decade, drug overdose deaths have risen 83% in Hawaii, more than 2x the nat'l average. Hospitalizations &amp; ER visits also doubled.
This bill will help set up our troops for success once they have laid down the uniform - I look forward to its passage.
It consolidates the Montgomery and Post 9/11 GI Bills into a single program over time, which will reduce VA cost and bureaucracy.
Our bill extends #GIBill eligibility from 15 years to lifetime and guarantees 100% eligibility for Purple Heart recipients.
I’m proud to be an original co-sponsor of the bipartisan Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act which strengthens the GI Bill.
Thanks to the #GIBill, more than 7,000 Hawaiʻi veterans used their earned education benefit last year, opening the door to new opportunity.

Some of my friends never came home from Iraq war; we have the duty not to allow lies/speculation to drag us into regime change war again.
No leader--of either party, for/against US intervention--should let POTUS escalate another regime change war without congressional approval.
We need to learn from Iraq and Libya—wars that were propagated as "humanitarian" but actually increased human suffering many times over.
Those who've declared Trump a habitual liar now vilify those refusing to blindly follow him into another regime change war. Hypocrisy.

This destructive war in Syria, like Iraq and Libya, aims at the regime change that left those countries in tatters. https://t.co/NDhmEoGQp3
Now, a proper investigation of the attacks will likely not even be possible because of Trump's reckless rush to bomb Syria.
The US should have supported a through UN investigation and international law in regard to the gas attacks in Syria.
US attacks on Syria won't save children, rather will strengthen al-Qaeda's attempts to overtake Syria, leading to more deaths and refugees.
Have we not learned from Iraq and Libya? The road to hell is paved w/ good intentions. Escalation means more dead children, more refugees.
Congressional approval is meant to help prevent aimless warfare without clear justification, goals and exit strategy.
Our Constitution is written so that the American people have the right to weigh in prior to acts of war. Congress must vote.

Let’s continue our resolve in 2017 and fight for positive change on the issues that we care so much about.
Congress must pass the #StopArmingTerroristsAct. It’s absurd our gov provides direct &amp; indirect support to those allied with al Qaeda/ISIS.
I’ll be back in DC tomorrow when the 115th Congress begins. I’m committed to standing w/you &amp; continuing our movement toward positive change
Starting off the new year right. #NewYearsDay https://t.co/KGWNGorphR

Divestment from fossil fuels is the way of the future. I'm hopeful that more of our businesses, universities, etc. choose this path.
We must fight against destructive trade deals that benefit corporations on the backs of American workers, who suffer as a result.
We need change so the ultra rich cannot game our political &amp; economic systems for their benefit on the backs of struggling middle class.

The financial stability of our nation depends on serious efforts to prevent Wall Street from making risky investments at taxpayers’ expense.
Let’s end the vicious cycle of slapping companies on the wrist, having them pay a small fine, with no change in their actions.
At the heart of this problem is big pharma companies lying about how dangerously addictive these drugs are, just so they can sell more.
The same @CDCgov data also found that opioids cause almost two-thirds of all drug-related overdoses in the United States. Let that sink in.

For years I have said that implementing a so-called no fly/safe zone would be disastrous for the Syrian people, our country, and the world.
The cause of peace is too great for us to allow political disagreements or partisanship to stand in our way.
Our illegal war to overthrow the Syrian government must end. Every day this war continues, more children are dying. We need peace.
And I will never allow partisanship to undermine our national security when the lives of millions of people lay in the balance.
I feel it is my duty to take every single opportunity I get to advocate for peace, no matter the circumstances of those meetings.
It would have been easier for me to refuse this meeting. But I never have — and never will — play politics with American and Syrian lives.
Rather, I shared my concerns that escalating the war in Syria with a no fly/safe zone would be disastrous &amp; could lead to a nuclear war.
