Give teachers the resources they need! Reduce class sizes, provide more support staff - counselors, nurses, librarians, psychologists...for the future of our children.
California is the 5th largest economy. There is no reason for us to be 41st in the nation in per pupil spending. LAUSD has $2 billion in reserve.
Everyone should support the teachers in this critical action that they have taken with their strike. We call on the school board and the superintendent to give them the resources and protections that they need to teach our children.
Today I joined the teachers. Teachers are the foundation of our democracy. They care for the most precious members of our society. The future! Our children. https://t.co/L2auNVCV9H

This will be my birthday present.  April 10 also the day Emiliano Zapata was martyred in Mexico. need to fight for justice. #LatinoHeritage
please, send emails,phone, visit your congressperson or Senator to vote for a just immigration law. Get five others to help #LatinoHeritage
Thanks to all who joined. Look me up at Dolores Huerta .org &amp; support our organizing so we can make a better world SiSePuede #LatinoHeritage
We have to change that thru elections &amp; public campaign financing. Latino progressives need to run for office &amp; be deciders  #LatinoHeritage
We have to look at economics. Our minimum wage should be over $20 an hr. CEO's are getting millions for 1 year of work.    #LatinoHeritage
Keep learning,  organizing. Work together &amp;  reach out to other orgs and people who need to hear our message of unity  #LatinoHeritage
We have to include getting rid of homophobia in our community. Fight for equality &amp; human rights for &amp; save our planet.   #LatinoHeritage
Be involved  If we work together we can overcome the obstacles: immigration, education, discrimination, racism, sexism,etc. #LatinoHeritage
Cesar was doing a 25day water only &amp; communion fast. I was asking them to support us. Arizona passed laws against strikes.  #LatinoHeritage
Si Se Puede started in  Arizona in 1972 when Latino Professionals said No Se Puede in Arizona &amp; and told them Si Se Puede  #LatinoHeritage
Cesar stood for non-violence, worker's rights, and end to poisons in our food, living a simple life &amp; service to others.  #LatinoHeritage
We have to get School Board positions and get our history in the school books K thru 12, make it mandatory for all to learn. #LatinoHeritage
This is why we have to fight for quality child care so women (and men) can participate in civic life &amp; know children are OK #LatinoHeritage
You can't analyze or think of why you can't do things.  Just do it. Had to ask everyone I knew to help with my children. #LatinoHeritage
This is also connected to high iencarcerations of our people including all of our people arrested for immigration violations #LatinoHeritage
The biggest issue is education. Our future is being stolen thru high expulsions, high  tuitions, low quality education.  #LatinoHeritage
We assign one organizer to each community. They teach them how to work together &amp; volunteer to make changes &amp; become leaders #LatinoHeritage
We organize low income people to come together in organization to fix the problems in  communities with paid organizers. #LatinoHeritage
Cesar was very disciplined, committed and inclusive.  We did not always agree on tactics, but agreed on vision &amp; philosophy #LatinoHeritage
We are stronger and more organized.  Its not enough. We have to fight for feminist values of equality in government. #LatinoHeritage
The struggle for women's rights is still hard.  That is why we have to continue to educate women and men to support us. #LatinoHeritage
Don't let anyone get in the way of your destiny. We don't always have to be  the "accomodators". Figure out how to win  #LatinoHeritage
The important thing is to take risks, don't give up when people criticize you for being assertive, fight for your ideas #LatinoHeritage
Women's leadership is always difficult. Cesar supported me and other women.Once people have faith in you, it happens. #LatinoHeritage
We are just starting.Thanks to Ken Salazar, Hilda Solis &amp; others our heritage &amp; legacies are now being honored and written. #LatinoHeritage
No, we were just trying to make life better for them and their families. Great that others copied our methods #LatinoHeritage
I consider myself to be an organizer.  Thanks to the teachings of Fred Ross Sr. and other leaders like Cesar Chavez #LatinoHeritage
@American Latino Thank you for the invitation  #LatinoHeritage
