I'm unapologetically anti illegal immigration &amp; pro legal immigration. It would be great if Cuomo found an ounce of integrity to admit he's pro illegal immigration rather than conflating it all &amp; simply saying he is pro-immigration, which couldn't be more deliberately misleading.
There are hard working, middle income NY taxpayers who can't afford to send their child to college, bc they don't qualify for free tuition $. If you want to expand aid to more college students then expand it for students who are in our country legally, not illegally.

Bipartisan CODEL. Bipartisan is a rule for my annual CODEL to the Middle East (Not on the beach in PR) for Christmas w our troops. What's next you ask? Lock us ALL in a room in DC. No pay. No phones.

The best way to end the partial gov't shutdown is for Dems to negotiate &amp; compromise on the need for increased border security funding. They are acting as if they have absolute power. Neither party does. This shutdown can end today. Negotiate &amp; compromise. It's a beautiful thing.

When someone illegally enters US, we can (1) detain the family together; (2) detain adults &amp; minors separately; (3) detain the adults &amp; release the kids into US as UACs; or (4) release them all. I choose option 1. Congressional Dems are choosing option 4. Which do you prefer?
Now up to 33 Members sponsoring H.Res.907, which I intro‚Äôd calling for a 2nd Special Counsel &amp; detailing misconduct at highest levels of DOJ/FBI re FISA abuse &amp; how/why the Clinton email probe ended &amp; Trump-Russia probe began. TY @RepRalphNorman for signing on this week!
After 9/11, Donato Panico drove from his LI deli to Ground Zero to feed the 1st responders. In thanks, 1 of the 1st responders gave him a flag flown near the pile. This flag has also been flown in Iraq &amp; today I gave it to @realdonaldtrump in the Oval Office at Donato‚Äôs request. https://t.co/5GdEc60hmA
In the meantime, my advice for anyone who doesn‚Äôt want to be detained for entering into the United States illegally is to not enter the United States illegally.
The Flores decision will either need to be reconsidered in the courts or Congress will need to pass legislation to change fed law. I support whichever option can be done swiftly &amp; correctly so that families are detained together at the border.
It‚Äôs also not good policy to immediately release families who enter our country illegally into our communities. I further believe that it would be wrong to detain the children in cages just like the Obama Admin did.
I met tdy w @realDonaldTrump at the WH to talk about the issue of separating families at the border &amp; other imp immigr policies. I welcome the new EO as a pos step. It‚Äôs not good policy to separate children at our border from their parents &amp; release them into the US as UACs.
Why is it easier to negotiate with Iran, China &amp; North Korea on issues like nuclear weapons, sanctions &amp; trade, then it is to get Congressional Dems to negotiate at all for a great bill on immigration?

Now do Obama: https://t.co/ADezUyOsCC https://t.co/RFmevBCsn7
Enforce the law, secure our borders &amp; stop illegal entry. Not a good policy to separate families at border. It creates more UACs in US. Best way to avoid trouble at border? Follow our rules &amp; don't enter US ILLEGALLY. Our laws are to be upheld &amp; respected, not ignored &amp; violated.
If Trump caged kids just like Obama did he'd get slammed (he doesn't). If kids go free into US as UACs he gets slammed. Want to come w your family to US? Follow the rules &amp; enter legally. Every nation's backbone is its rule of law &amp; a nation w/out borders is not a nation.
If anyone tells you the IG's report shows there was no political bias then to borrow a few legal terms‚û°Ô∏èthey are either being "willful", "negligent", or "reckless" w what really is an outright LIE. Don't take my word for it..or theirs...here's Exhibit A: https://t.co/Wl79qSwqt5

IG concludes Strzok's anti-Trump texts "not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate‚Äôs electoral prospects. This is antithetical to the core values of the FBI and (DOJ)."
Today's IG report is further confirmation of so many points of my 12 page House Resolution 907, detailing misconduct at the highest levels of the DOJ/FBI. H.Res.907, which is now up to 32 total sponsors, also calls for the appointment of a 2nd Special Counsel.

When the people on the other side of the negotiating table are laughing hysterically amongst themselves at just how much they completely rolled you in the negotiation, I'd take that as a pretty good clue that you just got horribly played as a total fool by those Iranians.
If Mueller doesn't have evidence that @realDonaldTrump colluded with the Russians to win election, why not just say so? Those who created this Trump-Russia collusion cloud have the duty to remove it NOW if they still have NOTHING.
AG @jeffsessions should reassess massive scope of his recusal, which is absurdly &amp; most unnecessarily broad. The Justice Dept works best w/ an Attorney General fully in charge. He's a good man allowing himself to be tied up, undercut, handcuffed &amp; silenced by others around him.

We finally have a U.S. Ambassador to Germany &amp; it couldn't have happened sooner, especially w/Chancellor Merkel about to arrive in DC. Congrats to @RichardGrenell on his important, time sensitive, necessary &amp; very well deserved confirmation!
Ridiculous though that so many Senate Dems voted NO. Hillary Clinton received 94 votes. John Kerry received 94 as well. Mike Pompeo received 57, bc of this lighting our hair on fire "resistance" to oppose everything &amp; anything. That's exactly why they are in the minority.
"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo". I love the sound of that! Most importantly though, he's intelligent, competent, qualified, and talented. Mike Pompeo is not only our new Secretary of State, but a leader capable of being one of our best ever.

DOJ/FBI shouldn't be opening/continuing/expanding investigations simply for winning election w/out evidence the candidate committed a crime to win the election. To be a tad more candid: This is an insider, dead end hack job still w/out a case for collusion.
Trump-Russia probe became a Special Counsel probe, bc @RealDonaldTrump won the Presidency...so the FBI Director then illegally leaked classified info to the media to trigger a Special Counsel appointment.
Trump-Russia probe was continued, bc @RealDonaldTrump was about to possibly win Presidency. It's clear why DOJ/FBI didn't want Nunes memo released. They broke rules and misled a FISA court to improperly secure a warrant to spy on a U.S. citizen.
Make no mistake...Trump-Russia probe was launched, bc @RealDonaldTrump won GOP nomination for Pres. It's clear why DOJ/FBI didn't want to turn over memo opening the investigation. They didn't come up w/ a sufficient alternative justification to start the probe.

FISA collection on an American citizen is an extremely powerful tool &amp; any abuse of that process is a massive problem that requires transparency, accountability &amp; solutions. Addressing this issue should be of concern for any American, regardless of one's political affiliation.
Also not disclosed to FISA Ct: Yahoo story's source was also Chris Steele, Bruce Ohr's wife worked for Fusion GPS, Connection between Ohr &amp; Steele, Page &amp; Papadopoulos weren't associates, etc. DOJ/FBI had duty to disclose whole story for secret warrant to spy on a U.S. citizen.
Schiff Memo just released. The reality remains that FBI/DOJ went to secret ct w/secret docs for a secret warrant to spy on a U.S. citizen relying on an unverified dossier w/out disclosing that DNC/Clinton campaign paid for it &amp; source was unreliable &amp; about to get fired.

Secret warrant at secret court to spy on a US citizen relied on unverified dossier w/out disclosing (1) DNC &amp; Clinton campaign funded (2) Steele was bad &amp; compromised source (3) known conflicts &amp; anti-Trump bias at highest levels of DOJ/FBI, etc. So important for govt to provide!

Nothing changes fact DOJ/FBI used unverified dossier in a secret court to obtain a secret warrant to spy on a US citizen. No disclosure to court that DNC paid for it &amp; was assembled by a bad, compromised source. There needs to be transparency &amp; accountability.
I have zero issue w/any of Schiff's points coming out if he changes some of it to say the same exact thing w/out unnecessarily compromising sources &amp; methods. Let's also release as much of the underlying FISA file as possible. Public is smart enough to form correct conclusions.
Friends don't let friends on @HouseIntelComm compromise good sources &amp; methods. Schiff deliberately &amp; unnecessarily loaded up his memo w/many sources &amp; methods that shouldn't be released &amp; he knows it. There's a 0% chance this isn't deliberate to play games, meddle &amp; obstruct.
Congratulations to the #PhiladelphiaEagles on their first #SuperBowl victory! Great game &amp; huge win.
The duty of gov't to provide all facts, even if facts are against govt's own argument, is most important in FISA Courts. This is a secret court where secret docs are used to get a secret warrant to spy at times on US citizens. Must never be weaponized or abused!
DOJ/FBI has legal obligation to present FISA Court w/all info known or should‚Äôve been known to US gov't. Failure to do so is a violation that the Court can hold those responsible in contempt for. https://t.co/8h2OhSRrxh
Schiff said memo would endanger natl sec. It did not. He said it contained sources &amp; methods that couldn't be released. He was lying. He said it was materially altered. It was not. Time &amp; again he repeatedly feeds media &amp; public TPs that are just not true. Why's he running point?
McCabe did in fact testify under oath that there would not have been a FISA warrant if not for the dossier. It was recorded.
Using secret docs in a secret court to spy must have highest safeguards to protect national sec AND civil liberties. FISA abuse is wrong. Almost all in DOJ/FBI are amazing, but the process &amp; misconduct at highest levels here must be addressed w transparency &amp; accountability.
W/out dossier, there would've been no FISA warrant. Was admitted under oath by McCabe. DOJ/FBI already knew dossier's source was unreliable &amp; shouldn't be used, but filed applic w/it anyways. Waited until after to fire Steele. Then applied for extensions on warrant anyways.
During #IranProtests, a young mother named Vida took off her hijab in a courageous act of protest against the Iranian regime. Arrested &amp; imprisoned, she inspired women across #Iran to do the same, rekindling a movement the Iranian gov. seeks to snuff out. #WhereIsShe
(4) Changes made to memo were very minor, including changes requested by FBI &amp; House minority. (5) This isn't an attack on the institutions. The end result will be better institutions. (6) No good sources &amp; methods will be revealed. It will reveal bad ones though.
Another reason to #ReleaseTheMemo: A lot of just really bad, inaccurate info being disseminated in meantime. (1) This isn't the "Nunes memo". He didn't draft it &amp; it's not his memo. (2) This is strictly about FISA abuse &amp; misconduct. (3) Its content is actually 100% non-partisan
~@RealDonaldTrump should declassify &amp; #ReleaseTheMemo ASAP as is. Public wants more info, not less, re FISA abuse &amp; who is responsible. Transparency &amp; accountability for really great, historic, legendary &amp; important agencies!

No way those Strzok and Page texts are actually unobtainable &amp; no chance those texts won't be providing very important, highly relevant and absolutely necessary info re how/why Trump-Russia probe was launched. #FindTheTexts https://t.co/erQA6fW67x
Smithtown's Donato Panico is going to @realDonaldTrump's #StateOfTheUnion! After the 9/11 attacks, deli owner Donato drove to Ground Zero to feed first responders.

There will need to be a new Special Counsel assigned. We cannot expect the DOJ &amp; FBI to properly investigate themselves w/so much significant, mounting evidence of misconduct at the highest levels re how and why the Clinton probe ended &amp; Trump-Russia probe began.
It needs to be known how/why the Clinton probe ended &amp; how/why the Trump-Russia probe began. Raw truth, only facts, &amp; total transparency. #FindTheTexts https://t.co/2NxPPiG5Pf
I can't for the life of me think of one positive thing this gov't shutdown actually accomplished. To see so many Dems vote to continue it just now was even crazier. Time to move on to more noble pursuits everyone! https://t.co/f4sIOLrvLK
Something very suspicious w these missing 5 mths of Strzok and Page texts. While ppl chase ridiculous shiny objects obsessively trying to prove President Trump colluded w Russia, more dots are connected that the crimes actually committed were to get this whole thing launched.
Color me skeptical that the Strzok-Page texts are actually "lost". I'd predict they are a million times more likely to fall under the categories of "revealing" &amp; "damaging" instead of "lost". In this order, what's needed is transparency, accountability, &amp; regaining public trust.
Congress needs to (1) subpoena from the cell service Strzok &amp; Page text messages; &amp; (2) request FBI perform full forensic exam of their employees' phones to see if they can recover the messages. Let the line shine brightly on the truth!
Cosponsored new bill w @RepMcSally to ensure when there is a #GovtShutdown military &amp; fed law enforcement get paid &amp; Congress doesn't; an important reversal of current law. In the meantime, I informed the House to withhold my pay until the shutdown ends https://t.co/tEOOoV0VHa
3 Great Americans: @RepDevinNunes @TGowdySC @RepGoodlatte having meetings to responsibly plan next steps w regards to shocking #FISAmemo. I'm calling to #ReleaseTheMemo &amp; all of the relevant sourced material. #ReleaseTheFile
Did you know that during a #GovtShutdown Members of Congress still get paid?! Not me. I told @CAOHouse to withhold my pay. It's crazy to me that Members of Congress get paid while military service members do not. https://t.co/dSQDkENvYT
It's critical that the #FISAMemo be released ASAP w/ALL related sourced material. Some only want Americans to get their info through @HouseDemocrats‚Äô #SchifftyLeaks.

Not only must the classified memo I read at HPSCI today be publicly released w/out delay by @HouseIntelComm but also ALL related material sourced out in the memo. #ReleaseTheMemo #ReleaseTheFile
Immediately #ReleaseTheMemo #FISAMemo &amp; ALL relevant material sourced in it. Every American needs to know the truth! We wouldn't be revealing any sources &amp; methods that we shouldn't; only feds' reliance on bad sources &amp; methods.
Releasing this classified info doesn't compromise good sources &amp; methods. It reveals the feds' reliance on bad sources &amp; methods.
Just read the classified doc @HPSCI re FISA abuse. I'm calling for its immediate public release w/relevant sourced material. The public must have access ASAP! #Transparency
