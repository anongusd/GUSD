@nathanheller @Metlandia I agree that the mask came down and that he waltzed from one emotional stance to another. Like you, I don't now how much of the anger was "genuine." But does anger have to be genuine to be valid? (The tears were genuine, don't you think?)
@Metlandia At no point was I engaging in debate society quibbling or contrarian point scoring. I was only noting the strong expressions among the Twitterate that he had no right to fume and sputter and objected. You're the one who added all the extra baggage.
@Metlandia Because (in my Twitter stream at least) Kavanaugh's anger has been used to disqualify him and his argument. I still have no solid idea of what happened between him and Dr. Ford.
@Metlandia An argument I didn't and don't make.
@Metlandia Okay, but before you go, I'll try to make my point one last time. Anger is not automatically disqualifying. I agree that it might not be the most elegant or persuasive form of argumentation.
@Metlandia I said nothing about his guilt/innocence. And what's the definition of a contrarian point? Something you disagree with?
@Metlandia I'm not defending his entire testimony, just the anger part of it.
