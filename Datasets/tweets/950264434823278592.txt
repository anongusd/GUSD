@MAGA_time1992 @twitsruntwitr @charliekirk11 @NRA I looked at it again...		Okay school shootings are not new		However, the amount has been increasing exponentially!		I still stand by what I said about hunting season and guns everywhere without school shootings...		Your point again is?
@twitsruntwitr @MAGA_time1992 @charliekirk11 @NRA By the way hot those stats right off of Wikipedia
@twitsruntwitr @MAGA_time1992 @charliekirk11 @NRA How are these minors getting guns and where was Cruz target practicing?		And what about his Parent, the one that someone said had eleven aliases... haven't heard or seen anything about him		The next person that says a word about gun control is getting blocked		I am sick of it!
@MAGA_time1992 @twitsruntwitr @charliekirk11 @NRA Are you trying to say that the mass murders like we are seeing in our schools today is nothing new because I find that difficult to swallow

@MAGA_time1992 @charliekirk11 @NRA "The U. S. Secret Service published a study regarding 37 school shootings in the U. S. from 1974 - 2000... how many since then?		Its a great reason to take your kids out of public schools &amp; open more private schools or home school		But unfortunately most can't afford it!
@cathyh4545 @GartrellLinda @REALtrumpbureau Uh, they do get more than just food you know...they get housing and bill money plus medical, dental, vision etc. 		There's W. I.

@ScottPresler @dblevins71 Correction... not FB... It was YouTube... sorry
@charliekirk11 @NRA Funny thing...		There weren't mass school shootings at all when I was going to school		NOT one!		And during hunting season there were all kinds of guns in the open on gun racks in the cabs of pick up all over the place!		But no one even imagined doing such a thing!

@kimsflowers100 @Oldblighty2 @bocavista2016 @realDonaldTrump Yep, you got it LOL		I friended you... like I said I don't get on GAB a whole lot so I am still trying to figure out how to use it... Fairly new to Twitter too, just got on last month.
@kimsflowers100 @Oldblighty2 @bocavista2016 @realDonaldTrump I wish I would have had a daughter, I have two sons &amp; have been pretty much in an all male environment most of my life...
@kimsflowers100 @Oldblighty2 @bocavista2016 @realDonaldTrump I looked it up... Mine is my full name Laura Lee Bowyer... which is of course what LLBowyer stands for... not very exciting or creative just being myself!
@kimsflowers100 @Oldblighty2 @bocavista2016 @realDonaldTrump I opened an account on GAB but spend all my time on Twitter to be honest.  I think I used the same as Twitter for GAB, now I am not sure since it's been weeks ago
@kimsflowers100 @Oldblighty2 @bocavista2016 @realDonaldTrump I keep telling myself that I should stop spending so much time on trying to keep up with all that's going on but I can't help it ITS EXCITING!  I wake up and wonder what I missed while I was sleeping		... I am addicted!
@kimsflowers100 @Oldblighty2 @bocavista2016 @realDonaldTrump I was never INTO politics either until now!
@Oldblighty2 @kimsflowers100 @bocavista2016 @realDonaldTrump I pay for YouTube Red, no commercials... tons of info there... alot of silly hyped up garbage too that can be distracting but you just have to carefully choose what to follow		A well developed intuition helps tons too... 		Its often very easy for me to tell when I am being BS'd!
@Oldblighty2 @kimsflowers100 @bocavista2016 @realDonaldTrump Search for it...its an alternative to Twitter that's not tied into the FBI &amp; CIA like Facebook &amp; Google, etc.		Its where everyone is going to end up if POTUS ever decides to switch to an UNMONITORED social network site I think		POTUS has made Twitter so popular!
