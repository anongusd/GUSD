@REESE_DA_BMA The bottom line is we beat the Refs and punk’d Khalil Mack.
@REESE_DA_BMA The TD called back was the most obvious “pick play” you’ll ever see, no way to try and get away with not calling that one LOL
@REESE_DA_BMA They had to call some of the obvious infractions occasionally.
Khalil Mack got clowned today by our sh*tty O-line 🤣	 #CHIvsMIA
@callmestige The Refs are obviously trying to help Chicago, this is ridiculous.
#MiamiDolphins Even though we recovered the fumble AGAIN #Bears held/tackled our pass rusher and the obvious pass interference not called also.	There’s no way the Refs are not trying to help Chicago.	#CHIvsMIA
3 minutes and #MiamiDolphins are depending on Osweiller to bring us back.	Fire Gase.	 #MiamiDolphins
@sandybeach0724 Not to this extent.	Focus on the Bears O-line, not the ball.	Almost every play they hold and drag down to the turf a Miami defender.

@SparrowOnTheEye The fact you refuse to answer says everything.	Fucking liberal hypocrites never fail to surprise me anymore.
@SparrowOnTheEye I have a serious question for you.	Do you believe any of Bill Clinton’s accusers?
@SparrowOnTheEye She never told anyone, a woman allowing young girls to continue being gang-raped.	She only comes out 36 yrs later and only days before her political adversary could be named to the Supreme Court.	Stop, you’re embarrassing yourself.
@SparrowOnTheEye Even you cannot believe there were repeated gang-rape parties and nobody said shit to anyone, especially teenagers who can’t keep a secret.	You repeating this unbelievable bullshit the Dems feed you make you look stupid.
@Wavinator He admitted that if true he wouldn’t necessarily support Kavanaugh.	Liberals are lying scumbags.

@ConnieBee16 @99JedMarlin Let’s not give those assholes ammo.
@99JedMarlin @ConnieBee16 She clams so.
@99JedMarlin IMO She is lying.	That said I thought the joke was a bit much even though I rarely get offended by anything.	It didn’t offend me, just think all things considered it doesn’t help anything.
@ConnieBee16 @99JedMarlin I don’t get outraged usually.	I’m not even outraged by that tweet but joking about someone enjoying being gang-raped is a bit much.
@PPSNE Kinda ironic seeing Planned Parenthood mentioning ‘survivors’.
@PPSNE Dismembering viable unborn children in their mothers womb, not to mention your Gov’t subsidies must bring down a pretty penny.	No wonder this dude scares you.
She was an adult attending high school age parties claiming she witnessed young girls getting gang-raped.	There is no fucking way a woman would not tell someone, especially to save those girls.	You could report crimes anonymously and let authorities investigate.	I call bullshit. https://t.co/7PgLvAGS8f

@PetersShannon28 She stands by her declaration that she repeatedly attended gang-rape parties yet never contacted police, warned parents, etc.	Avenatti fucked up even worse this time, thank God.
@99JedMarlin I don’t believe her but this is a pretty shitty tweet man, grow up.
I think this is where Creepy Porn Lawyer fucked up.	In an attempt to make the accusation massive he inadvertently made it unbelievable by anyone sane. https://t.co/F2CHKkCZVp
@SparrowOnTheEye If her story is true she is responsible for any rapist she did not report.	You watch younger girls getting gang-raped at ten different parties and never report it to anyone, you’re also responsible.
@PhersonCindy What makes you believe her?
@mfwooten1 @davidmackau There’s no fucking notary, wake up and do the math..
@mfwooten1 @davidmackau You don’t find it interesting that it’s not an affidavit, which has to notarized with additional witnesses to her signing it which would have to include the actual date.	You don’t find it interesting the font is different on the ‘Beach Week’ line?
@mfwooten1 @davidmackau Prove it!
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump She claimed he ‘attempted to spike’ the Punch.	I’m convinced all Democrats are liars.
@mfwooten1 @davidmackau CNN tweeted the calendar at 8:05, Avenatti tweeted her statement at 10:44.
@MyMagicBus The calendar was released 1st, bottom line.	Oh and the line mentioning it is different font.	The Beach Week thingy is a non-starter for the accuser and Avenatti.
@mfwooten1 @davidmackau I’m almost positive I saw it last night, I could be wrong.	Let’s do this... CNN tweeted the calendar at 8 this morning, what time did avenatti release her statement today?
@MyMagicBus Calendar released yesterday, her statement today.
@andypanda_c9 @UniteWomenNJ It’s hard to believe a 20 yr old woman goes to at least 10 parties where she witnesses teenage girls being gang-raped says nothing, to anyone.

@mfwooten1 @davidmackau The calendar was released 1st.

@londblu You cannot answer why Al Alawkis 16 son was killed by Obama.	I fear your over-indulgence in protein intake has clouded your judgement.
@londblu You have to show everyone where Al Alawkis  16 yr old son killed by Obama broke any rule in your Geneva convention.

@londblu @HopeAngelBB @FBI Bigtime, but loving it 😂
@londblu You said he was standing beside his dad, then changed that to 2 yrs later.	Asshole do you defend Obama killing Al Alawkis 16 yr old son or no?	If so, why?
@londblu @HopeAngelBB @FBI Read my tweets that last 10 yrs idiot.	Nothing has changed and no knocks on the door.
@londblu BTW, YOU still haven’t answered whether it was okay to kill Al Alawkis son.
@londblu Do you believe in partial birth abortion?
@londblu @HopeAngelBB I’m defending Muslim kids who you claim are okay to murder.	Try harder.
@londblu You admit Al Alawkis 16 son who was killed by Obama was okay.	You may be the worst hypocrite I’ve come across in here.
@londblu Do you support abortion?
@londblu @HopeAngelBB If Trump killed a little girl he’s guilty.	Admit Obama is guilty of killing many brown babies in the 3rd world you hypocrites.
@londblu @HopeAngelBB Yo will NEVER be able to defend Obama’s drone-killing Brown 3rd world children.	We all see that now.

This is why I give Wayne credit (but at one time I didn’t).	He didn’t jump on the Black Conservative Bandwagon I’ve seen.	He has had this same message for years now, way before it was popular and/or pays dividends like what we seen in some others.	IMO the real deal. https://t.co/w7q9qtk1yi

@raeberries77 Obama was known for two things..	1) Not being able to negotiate with any success.	2) Carpet bombing poor brown people in 3rd world Countries.
@raeberries77 This time he’s not dealing with assholes like Obama and even previous Repub Presidents.	Trump basically told him to fuck off 3 weeks ago, now they’re making history by simply meeting.	Do the math.
Chris Wallace is a total dick.
@PollyTickal I’m watching the Singapore summit on fox.	Hannity is featuring Seb Gorka.	I keep thinking Gorka would make Hitler blush with envy.	But that’s just me 🙃
@demi215 He worked for Bill Clinton.	I understand his frustration.	At the same time he was getting blowjobs in the Oval Office he was carpet bombing Iraqi civilians and aspirin factories in the Sudan.	Pretty shitty legacy.

@aiden_storey @nytimes You’re smoking crack, right?
Robert DeNiro is a washed up bitter man who only bashes our President out of jealously.	DeNiro owns a few restaurants.	President Trump owns a worldwide firm and is leader of he free world.	The Hollywood has-been crowd are embarrassing.

@RIGonculous @Nina_I_Kelley @sally_field I found Jesus 12 minutes ago and deleted my account.	Your timing sucks.
@Inf_Adel Rafidahs are generally (but not in all cases) degenerates to the max.	Infidel or not you’re steeped in your culture.	You guys have a history of treating women like shit.	Ayesha narrative not to mention Nikah Mutah.	At least you’re being consistent LOL

@RIGonculous @Nina_I_Kelley @sally_field I didn’t have the heart to make her look bad when realizing she didn’t understand the tweet.
@ElleDiablo98 Obviously she doesn’t believe in what she said, she apologized for the $$$	Keep supporting someone that only cares about taking your money.	Her apology proves she’s a fake.
@SheCoBro @D_L_Wolfe @kathygriffin @iamsambee Too late.	Samantha has already crawled back to eat sh*t (by apologizing) saving her D-List Micro-Fame and $$$.
Exactly.	She obviously doesn’t believe in what she says, she cares more about fame and $$$	I myself enjoyed watching her crawl back and having to eat sh*t. https://t.co/w29ARUub1M
@Nina_I_Kelley @sally_field She was pretty much universally loved, this tweet will change that.	I wish she would have never commented on this.
@geekblz @KarenShea77 @sally_field I agree she’s probably not devastated, in fact if it were not for Twitter I’m guessing Sally would be sitting in a rocking chair talking to herself/screaming at the wall.
@Nina_I_Kelley @sally_field Yup the real deal.	Known for always playing a nice and all around decent human being.	She was a better actress than I realized.

@jerm_26 @JepBoston You guys are the ones that got humiliated, from what I saw in the SB it only gets worse from here.	Seeing how butthurt you are is worth the price of admission trust me.	Out-coached, outplayed everything, it was the best.
@jerm_26 Nobody expected my Dolphins to do anything with this s*** coach like Gase.	You guys basically got raped by the underdog in the SB
@jerm_26 The funniest part is how butthurt you still are over being humiliated how many months later :p
@jerm_26 On like 6 plays dumbass, I can't wait to f*** with you this upcoming season.
@jerm_26 Watch some game film sport,	Even a tiny bit of contact has  him nervous because he's a pussy.	Eagles D game-planned for that.	And we all saw the result.
@jerm_26 Brady is a pussy, early pressure and/or contact has him dancing and making bad decisions, not to mention he's old.	Trust me the rest of the AFC East wants him to stick around.	You guys are done, for years.
@Coach_Bob_1956 @jerm_26 I was alive and remember our Super Bowl wins and our perfect season.	God willing you’re alive long enough to see the Patriots have a perfect season, But I doubt it especially considering you guys are on the down-swing.	Your glory days are nothing but a memory now, LOL.

@jerm_26 Get back to me when you guys have a perfect season.	Oh and the best part of your SB loss Was because it was mainly because you were outcoached.
