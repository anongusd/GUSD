@sacbee_news there is no reason for citizens to be shot by law enforcement unless they engage in an actual firefight. Implying that running from a cop is a reasonable excuse for a cop to use deadly force is a perspective that should call one's mental health into question..

@Seb_Aguanno @fekerksa_en Do Christians know for sure they are being led up the path of Christ(1 Timothy 4:1-2)?

@alfonslopeztena What was in the tea?🤔
@fekerksa_en Let's talk about Qur'an 47:4. Muhammad states in 5:46 &amp; 5:111 that Muslims should believe in the teachings of the Gospel. The Gospel's Warfare teachings say we battle evil principles, make everything captive to God's principles and our sword is the word of God, not an actual 🗡

@fekerksa_en The Qur'an = A constant endorsement of the Torah and the Gospel of Jesus (Qur'an 5:46). Does MBS know these as the Prophet Muhammad would expect (Qur'an 5:111)? Does Islamic leadership know how to apply the principles Christ taught, or do they follow tradition(Qur'an 5:104)?

@LandonMichigan @GOPLeader Yes, and you are out of context from my initial point. How does the bill or your two cents have anything to do with banning late term abortions unless medically necessary?
@LandonMichigan @GOPLeader Can you find any literature that says there is never a medical necessity for the procedure? Or is your argument based entirely on, your "findings"?
@LandonMichigan @GOPLeader Sounds pretentious dude. Reading comprehension often escapes people who read the Bible, so you're no exception there. I worked in a NICU as a wound care clinician, and your all or nothing perspective is narrow &amp; uninformed (the most polite way to put it). https://t.co/oiNOAwQyni
@LandonMichigan @GOPLeader "Okay," that's your debate follow up?
@LandonMichigan @GOPLeader And in case you missed the name, we are Gentiles, who owe our *sophistication* to God. Romans 2:14 - “Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature things required by the law, they are a law for themselves, even though they do not have the law.”
@LandonMichigan @GOPLeader All I can do is offer a word of guidance from our Lord; read John 8:4-5 and the article I posted. To follow Christ, we don’t ever hide behind law. “...babies had “no faces, with no way to eat or breathe,” and would die almost immediately after birth.”- https://t.co/B6UQXvcu3l

@papergirlmacy Well done Beth:) In few words, I was raised around illicit drug users/sellers. My experience with the underbelly of society combined with classified intel learned in service w/the US Navy and time as a frontline clinician in LTC/SNF settings offer me a unique perspective on issue
@KristaSparks95 @CBSNews As in your husbands case, it is not them choosing to continue to use but rather a physiological response to a sensation that must be horrible and we should count ourselves blessed to not be in the teeth of that beast, opium. It is a gift from God and a Chemical WMD, like cocaine
@KristaSparks95 @CBSNews Mostly it's the effect of excessive production of the neurotransmitter noradrenaline when dependent users try to stop. This causes an additionally painful physical response and the chemical answer for the user's *brain* to stop this experience is to continue using an opiate.
@gbannan @KristaSparks95 @CBSNews @papergirlmacy Mostly it's the effect of excessive production of the neurotransmitter noradrenaline when dependent users try to stop.

@KristaSparks95 @CBSNews Agree that most chronic pain patients do end up dependent on opioids. However, "most drug addictions" don't begin with chronic pain disorders. Chronic pain is a quiet epidemic itself, and other than surgery which isn't always a long term solution, opiates facilitate pain relief
@KristaSparks95 @CBSNews "Most addictions begin with the crap pharmaceuticals put out there." - We'll have to disagree with that. Most addictions begin due to generational drug abuse and a social acceptance/ignorance of the systematic process by which distribution happens. And yes, we personally know:)

@CBSNews Heroin coming from Mexican and Chinese distribution networks are the root of the epidemic. The pills just fill supply gaps where the Heroin is harder to reach. The real issue is that the Sackler family learned their sales tactics from the opium lords and aiming at American people

@corder_sherrie @LauraGarciaNBC @nbcbayarea The Parable of the Unmerciful Servant	Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? Up to seven times?”	Jesus answered, “I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.[a]	Matthew 18:21-22
@SamBass01143124 @whudupsteph @AOC @RELEVANT Ok. Romans 13:8-10, 13:13, [Deuteronomy 17:17 He must not take many wives, or his heart will be led astray. He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold.]	God will decide if he’s worthy of the authority. I don’t have to agree to obey.

@corder_sherrie @LauraGarciaNBC @nbcbayarea Jesus gave us two commandments, one of which SPECIFICALLY says love thy neighbor, literally, figuratively, GLOBALLY. Galatians 3:28 There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
@corder_sherrie @LauraGarciaNBC @nbcbayarea Mark 12:30-31 NIV	30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’[a] 31 The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’[b] There is no commandment greater than these.”
