Sanders to take an amusing dig at Trump tomorrow: “I did not come from a family that had the power to go on television to entertain people by telling workers: 'You're fired.’” https://t.co/hGk1jhkaOJ

You’re willing to bet he’d try? How much? We should talk. https://t.co/UQvw2mpUV6

He’d need all but 3 to do it: https://t.co/EsFRYqGIoK https://t.co/KId51RULKP
His own party won’t back a play for him to go around congress for $5 billion for his stupid wall. $5 billion isn’t even enough to qualify as a rounding error for the Pentagon. And you think these same people would let him seize the whole government? https://t.co/khZTuE2MsV
What you’ve outlined is exactly a coup. He can’t just grab a couch in the Oval Office and refuse to go. He’d need every key agency backing him, the military, local police, etc. it would be a gazillion-to-one gambit for a popular DC politician, and he isn’t that. https://t.co/85SZYCdcqd
It’s not up to him. To refuse to leave after being voted out would require the assent of virtually the entire apparatus of government - the armed part, anyway. He’s got a much better shot of just winning re-election. https://t.co/XC8gCkEyOG
Things like voter suppression are real problems, but I can’t see a coup. Trump can barely find people to serve as nominal heads of his agencies. He’s going to get the Pentagon and the security chiefs to back a play by him to cancel elections? https://t.co/AI0Ci99ZJV

A big innovation in media was that the cheapest form of action programming is two idiots on a panel arguing in perpetuity. https://t.co/DJ1fd3PRgn
No, although the impact of social media is a big theme. The levels of vitriol we reach now would have been hard to imagine in the days when people watched or read news just once or twice a day. Now reporters never really sign off - the show never ends. https://t.co/xZvNOxU2OQ
From Nomi Prins: “The top 0.1 percent…takes home more than 198 times the income of the bottom 90 percent.” https://t.co/5gnYGBI6fP

Including Stone just BS-ing the idiots in that room by pretending he had an inside source when actually he just read Twitter. https://t.co/XTU0jmgote
Assange being the most surveilled human on earth should also be relevant I think. If such a call existed it’s hard to see how it could not be referenced in the Mueller indictment. https://t.co/5SSd0zxRz8
If they replaced the House Oversight Committee with Sacha Baron Cohen in 42 costumes, would we notice? https://t.co/wB20Hgyiz5
No, Cohen does not make a distinction. All he says is Stone claimed "there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton's campaign," which is consistent with Assange announcing he had "emails related to Hillary Clinton... pending publication." https://t.co/PETg6BueUT
The DNC was July 25-28, 2016. Assange announced the first of many times an upcoming leak on June 12, 2016. Therefore Cohen testifying to hearing about it in a meeting in a July, “days” before the DNC (how many days?), doesn’t speak to “advance” knowledge in any real sense. https://t.co/H1VU3FaMXi
What news outlet is that? #overunder https://t.co/Sxqe0AdrHY
No, I don’t support Trump - I wrote a whole book calling him a clown. I think all of this schlock reporting is going to get him re-elected. Every day, we’re validating his rants about the media. https://t.co/HJ29Kepzh8
I'll put the outlets at 21 and the mentions at 310, and I'll #taketheover. By what date should we make this? How about Friday morning? https://t.co/BAD8COMHN9
Exactly. This wasn't exactly smuggling out Khruschev's secret speech. https://t.co/qoNddVM0g2
Any media figure who does not point out the June 12th Assange announcement when reporting today's "in advance" line is going to be committing malpractice. If they've got evidence that Trump et al were "in on" the DNC hack, they should present it and we'll all report it that way. https://t.co/aPAMdJVfLS
The Stone indictment doesn't refer to a call between Stone and Assange, likely because none took place. This looks like Cohen testifying Stone bullshitted Trump, parsing phrases like "in advance," which here seems to mean "in advance of publication," not "advance knowledge." https://t.co/a9L1KnbDNJ
Over/under on news outlets today who'll underscore Cohen's testimony that Trump in July 2016 knew "in advance" and "ahead of time" of a Wikileaks dump damaging to Clinton, and leave out that Assange announced this on TV on June 12? https://t.co/kfRGoO04Ok @wikileaks

Ah, yes, Friedman's "first rule of holes" (he never told us his 2nd/3rd/4th etc rules of holes). It actually refers to being in THREE holes:	"The first rule of holes is when you’re in one, stop digging. When you’re in three, bring a lot of shovels."	https://t.co/oZrOj6gRM9 https://t.co/wnLQxGvPgs

Corporate media tend to respond to accusations of bias by adding voices from their idea of "other side." It's why op-ed pages tend to be matched sets of red and blue  pundits. I think they'd be better off if they hired more people who think politicians just generally suck. https://t.co/IBXjotPRtT
Right. Not that it necessarily made sense to bail out every subprime mortgage, but the argument against doing so was “moral hazard” - and then we ended up spending considerably more to rescue companies that had made bad/criminal decisions. https://t.co/4tNTa2Xwne

Also, individuals mostly got to keep ill-gotten gains. https://t.co/UNu16HRnG2
It’s inherently unfair if ordinary people do jail time (and make 100% repayment) for offenses white collar offenders commit on a grand scale while incurring no personal penalty. And this is without mentioning: many bank settlements were/are at least partially tax deductible https://t.co/z5Sv0GdYkY
No, you made a good point. But you’ll find many of the giant white-collar settlements take place after companies have explicitly promised to stop doing the bad thing. HSBC for instance had multiple regulatory warnings before the big $1.9 billion penalty. https://t.co/SxwAJjnUME
See the next tweet. Most of the biggest banks are also repeat fraud offenders: https://t.co/6ePTNEa7w6 https://t.co/RsyNnTrL29
Oh, by the way, both of those fraud cases involved repeat offenders. The Times found 51 cases of banks committing fraud after promising at least once not to violate the same statute: https://t.co/6ePTNEa7w6 https://t.co/Hof0zeEpOX
Here’s a woman who got five years in jail for $11,501 of welfare fraud: https://t.co/RaRs1vjxct And here’s a no-jail settlement for Bank of America for defrauding Fannie and Freddie out of billions: https://t.co/3FWZV4sNAA https://t.co/Er8A3oeqy1
Here’s a case where authorities gave a Hispanic racetrack owner a 20-year jail sentence for laundering about 55 times less than HSBC laundered: https://t.co/FVrvO1Uqql https://t.co/Er8A3oeqy1
So this is my favorite no-jail settlement: a deferred prosecution of HSBC (complete with “partially” deferred executive bonuses!) for laundering “at least $881 million in drug trafficking proceeds”: https://t.co/DeIBtedFOs https://t.co/Er8A3oeqy1
You’re the food truck troll! One of my favorites. Thank you for inspiring me to go back and look at your recent work, like the tweet asserting no bankers committed prosecutable crimes during the crisis era.

The latest chapter of Hate Inc., on the dangers of unconfirmable scoops sourced to unnamed national security officials - updated with new notes in the wake of the Buzzfeed story:  https://t.co/OifXZoApGk
I should rephrase - it’s considered normal practice to publish info that may be unconfirmable if you have enough of the “right” sources. I’ve been trying to point out we’ve done this with national security stories going back decades, and it may be time to reconsider. https://t.co/fSdVzYleCa
Amazing: “The electorate is putting more progressives and self-described socialists in... ironically, years ago... one of the missions of the FBI in its counterintelligence efforts was to try to keep these people out of government.” Terry Turchie, fmr FBI Dep. Asst. Director https://t.co/omrSei4EP6
No idea, but it’s very possible they did everything by the book. You can have a source over-interpret something and you might through no fault of your own hear the same tale from different directions. Or it’s a semantic issue where sources and Mueller are at odds. https://t.co/zPOKoXu0U5
Except in rare cases, there’s no professional penalty for being wrong when your sources are official. Nobody is ever humiliated for reporting that everybody killed in a bombing was a “militant” when it later turns out many were children, etc. https://t.co/YbqOtKrBfJ
No, it’s even more mockable. Who do you think would be doing the certifying? The same idiots who feed reporters fake stories. This whole problem is rooted in a credentialing mania. The most trustworthy reporters have always been outside-the-tenters like I.F. Stone. https://t.co/OJJfcT3cay
I had this chapter written before yesterday. This little kink in the system involving unnamed sources and unconfirmable info is something that bothered me long before Russiagate. https://t.co/tHFUnaSRmB
In the wake of yesterday’s Buzzfeed bombshell, this chapter of Hate Inc. looks at a media loophole behind similar stories from the past:  https://t.co/OifXZoApGk

Four years ago today, a grand jury refused to indict police in the killing of Eric Garner. As I found out researching his death, long special grand jury investigations that do not end in indictments are part of a pattern in police-abuse cases: https://t.co/UuFX6ivntY

Your esteemed still-“reputable” TV commentator. https://t.co/MTC8ugPU3P
Would like some other stories we’ve whiffed on? Our press has had great moments but also very bad ones, usually credulous reports of official fictions about everything from Jim Crow to the missile gap to America’s role in massacres in Indonesia, Guatemala, the Philippines, etc. https://t.co/uPUpc2UrbR
Your take on gatekeepers ignores the fact the the most pernicious form of “utter bullshit” tends to be official propaganda. https://t.co/6RZrZy3NiM

Argh. You wouldn’t (although the DNC did) because the material itself was not libelous. Hacking, however, is a crime. There are also existing restrictions on foreign electioneering. The notion that we need a vast opaque new censorship regime to deal with these issues is false. https://t.co/WB8Gc37MIK

Yes, I’m aware of that. What I’m saying is the system has turned into a way to end-around the First Amendment: first concentrate press distribution in a few private hands, then have quasi-official bodies “advise” those private platforms on whom to delete. https://t.co/WwwTLdTo1p

One can see the logic they’re going for in stressing “authoritative content” - it will derank actual fake news - but it will also penalize alternative sites, even if their material is more directly “relevant” to your search. https://t.co/Ssr286jrll
Re the WSWS: Google is stressing “authoritative content” over “relevance.” Sites with mainstream recognition, like Pulitzer Prizes, are “surfaced” more. So you’re more likely to be shown a New York Times article about Trotskyism than material from a Trotskyist web site. https://t.co/Ssr286jrll

Clearly a lot of right-wing sites have been affected as well. What I’m trying to point out is that that does not appear to be the sole focus of these “fake news” campaigns. A lot of the sites affected, like @ANTIMEDIAnews and The Free Thought Project, defy traditional labels. https://t.co/vOpDJ1seFW
Reverb Press, Blue State Daily, and Liberal America are the most obvious examples. And that doesn’t count sites like TeleSUR or Safa abroad. Many pro-Palestinian sites have been removed from various platforms. https://t.co/iMxUPKi7uD
What’s been most frustrating about this story is that people often seem to be in favor of sites being shut down, until someone they like is affected. People need to understand that this is less a left-right issue than a big-small issue. https://t.co/KpxrGs1Xpd https://t.co/YDmjzM8NFc
Pro-Democratic sites like “Reverb Press” and “Liberal America,” as well as numerous sites devoted to issues like police brutality or ending the drug war, have been removed in recent campaigns against “fake news.”                          https://t.co/KpxrGs1Xpd https://t.co/YDmjzM8NFc

I have to keep repeating this: reporters regularly publish stolen, hacked, or illegally-obtained material.

So when Trump was calling for Assange to get the “death penalty” after the release of the Manning video, he was playing the long game? https://t.co/v1uvmvIBkm

I have two other sources on that, plus the fact that WL-related search warrants were served in connection with felony charges two years before the last election, plus the fact that it’s been widely reported he was under FBI investigation back in 2009-2010. https://t.co/IEf0qT9UKU
I’m going to keep answering this the same way: this case almost certainly pre-dates 2016, and you might want to think about what that means. https://t.co/dYHzCJqwZs
I’ve disagreed with Assange often but understood from the start that he/WikiLeaks was going to end up being a test case for how reporting of leaks would be dealt with in the post-9/11 era. The recent aggressive use of the Espionage Act to prosecute leakers has been a warmup. https://t.co/sjMQAxgYIG
I’m going to keep answering this the same way: these charges almost certainly involve pre-2016 behavior. So you might want to try to think about what that means. https://t.co/CYRFuaYhwY

They were down on Dean from the start. Again, I was on his introductory plane trip with the national media. He was asked if he was “too liberal” or “too antiwar” about once every ten seconds. https://t.co/64CvIlwdhO
The press traditionally had a lot of say in terms of who was taken seriously and who was not - hell, they sort of succeeded in telling voters Howard Dean was too radical. In 2016 voters ignored these pronouncements and many pundits couldn’t wrap their heads around it. https://t.co/9XfmWiJ4ge

That’s not necessarily a component of propaganda. It always has the connotation of persuading in support of a point of view, but it doesn’t necessarily mean being misleading or untrue. https://t.co/8joyYpFdVO
Every editorial choice made is crammed full of point of view and (often unconscious) biases. You can aspire to objectivity, but you’re always pushing a set of values, even if they’re just commercial ones that for instance avoid depressing or dispiriting images. https://t.co/wwYGiErZYh

They didn’t release anything about misconduct? Manning released video of the military firing on Reuters journalists (among other things) and Snowden revealed a vast extralegal data-collection regime, about which the Director of National Intelligence lied to Congress. https://t.co/MG5dg2XZd0
I agree, and that’s why I haven’t always liked what they’ve done over the years. But most of those questions are ethical, not criminal. https://t.co/kvceU2nKwu
3) The bar should probably be very high for prosecuting the publication of true things. https://t.co/9CMTz5mVjT

1) If he didn’t actually steal materials himself, and only published - and remember, any existing case is likely about pre-2016 behavior - then that would have major ramifications for all journalists. https://t.co/9CMTz5mVjT
I don’t agree, but it doesn’t matter. He doesn’t have to be a journalist for a certain kind of prosecution of him to impact people you would consider journalists. The First Amendment implications would be the same. https://t.co/wfXldKNRnv
I’m not sure what you mean by “solicited.” Journalists regularly publish leaked, stolen, and illegally-obtained material. The Supreme Court has said this is protected behavior. A prosecution that redefines such publication as criminal conspiracy would be devastating. https://t.co/YgiKNp87kW
That’s true. The comments by people like Jeff Sessions (who called prosecuting Assange a “priority”) and Mike Pompeo suggest they were looking for a way around First Amendment issues, but not knowing what the charge is or even for sure if there is one, it’s hard to say. https://t.co/Psg8yrCCUd
First, though the charge isn’t known, I hear it’s unlikely to be related to 2016. Secondly, journalists routinely publish illegally-obtained information, and current law says we’re not liable for doing so. A case that says otherwise would have sweeping implications for us all. https://t.co/Kz8VxuJTNT

Yup. I was on the “Grassroots Express,” Dean’s introductory trip. Reporters must have asked fifty times a day if Dean felt he had the “right temperament” (or some variation thereof) to be president. Somehow, there was already a party line that he was too “pointed” for the job. https://t.co/Dteab6xkI3

Here's Bernie's policy director @GunnelsWarren listing some ideas that would have a shot at getting through congress if party leaders could embrace them: https://t.co/yNttlcFxpT
Another problem with this analysis: a lot of House candidates ran more progressive in the primaries, then backed away from positions like single-payer in the general. Which is normal, but not necessarily predictive of how a national presidential race would play out. https://t.co/9zlD9E7AzO
Yes -- wrote about that later: https://t.co/l1orTi0cxe https://t.co/c60YG9iJcE
That's absolutely true, but sadly, that is what politicians are for: marketing other peoples' ideas. A good politician is one who is able to recognize which voices in the ear are the right ones. And then ideally they're able to find a way to sell reforms to the public. https://t.co/Qr5dAc1FNQ
It's not about optimism exactly. You push the agenda for its own sake and force Trump to take a concrete position on many populist stances he's taken. Even if he doesn't pass it, the public sees the attempt, and there is also the framework for future movement on those issues. https://t.co/cPpv4O1MA7
Exactly. As is, the biggest efforts to work with Trump have been rolling back Dodd-Frank and jacking up the defense budget. Call his bluff in other areas, like drug re-importation, which I remember Trump endorsing. https://t.co/hJ19TGPMar
Note how the bottom of that story doesn't quite match the headline. Sanders on such calls for Dems to be more moderate: "They have been spouting that absurd line forever... [It] enabled Republicans to gain control of the Senate and the House and the White House." https://t.co/9zlD9E7AzO
Sanders: “I would not be shocked that if the Democrats passed popular, good legislation, that Trump would look around him and say, 'Hey, why not? What do I give a damn?' And he may come on board, because ultimately he doesn’t believe in anything except winning.” More: https://t.co/q55JGEx6co
Sanders warns that not coming out with a progressive legislative agenda early would be a “very, very serious mistake,” and says House Democrats should definitely do investigations, but shouldn't stop there: "People can chew bubble gum and walk at the same time," he says. https://t.co/q55JGEx6co

“They” are not the U.S. government. If it’s more than one person at all, they merely claimed associations with governmental and quasi-governmental organizations. I don’t think anyone on their list of “allies” has publicly vouched for “them.” Am I wrong, @propornot? https://t.co/ugmb76sggP

The weird thing is, the more serious the political situation, the more shallow the news. The infotainment/WWE aspect of coverage has gotten so much worse in the last few years. I have to assume this has its roots in how profitable Trump coverage is. https://t.co/YBX4EZmKBX
Part 2 of my book on the media, The Fairway, is out. It’s called “The Ten Rules Of Hate” and talks about the Crossfire-ization of news - how we sell political division.  https://t.co/loBhDzqv08
Broadcast stations leased public airwaves, and newspapers mainly managed their own distribution. We’ve never had a situation where so much private distribution power was so concentrated. Google and FB are essentially a distribution duopoly. https://t.co/1oWQrOLN7L

Yes, and his defiance of these conventional-wisdom policing tactics was a huge hit with his voters. He was aided by the fact that the people the national media were calling the “real” or “inevitable” candidates, like Jeb Bush, barely had a pulse in polls. https://t.co/piQc9m610h
Here’s a classic example of signaling about real/not-real candidates: the New Yorker, at the start of the 2015-2016 race, saying Bernie Sanders was good for Clinton, because he’d deny the left to “more plausible candidates” like Martin O’Malley. https://t.co/NDOHggRswh
The national press signals to voters who is and is not a “real” candidate using words like “fringe,” “longshot,” “insurgent,” a “statement” candidate, etc. to identify the “losers.” They are asked questions like “Why stay in?” during debates. There are many techniques. https://t.co/iEThvaH09N

I’ve had this argument with colleagues. Mythmaking is totally okay in sports (kids follow sports!). But encouraging voters to be rooters is not a positive. There’s a lot of political homerism now, and we encourage it because it’s an easy way to sell political news. https://t.co/KYnt72Oetv
This! Every year they add more graphic doodads and prognostication tools to make it more of a sports story, absolving us of the need to cover depressing policy issues, or ask why this hackneyed horse race system may not work for people. https://t.co/w1HHZndMPX
The presidential election massively enhances this effect because it even follows sports narratives: 18 months of scheduled contests, preseason (straw polls) regular season (primaries) and playoffs (the general), stadium events, a sub-genre of stats reporting - it goes on and on. https://t.co/t053HY8fm7
I don’t understand why, it was a good point. He was saying I should pay more attention to the choices media audiences make and look into the role that’s played in creating this clickbait era. https://t.co/GmERdOPLaL
Somewhat, but the elections  are exact copies of sports coverage, including “countdown to gametime” clocks, “our experts pick” charts, “magic number” delegate counts, real-time “% chance of winning” trackers, and on and on. https://t.co/YrKqaxZMU6
I understand that audiences have a responsibility to make wise consumer choices with media. I’m just probably a little more sensitive to the manipulative practices because I work in the field. https://t.co/SaQaK2HwiH
That’s a good point - I don’t at all believe audiences are sheep, in fact the last election was pretty graphic proof (on both sides) that they think for themselves. I do however think media companies intentionally appeal to our dumb side, as fast food chains pack meals with fat. https://t.co/SaQaK2HwiH

Moreover, the fact that Trump lies a lot just adds more commercial opportunity -- you get to create a second round of content correcting him. Not that he shouldn't be debunked, but there's a commercial pull under all of this that gives him a massive publicity advantage (2/2) https://t.co/7c9Pwt1R8d
I don't agree with everything here, but this is part of what I'm trying to get at in The Fairway. The 24-hour news cycle wedded to infinite ad space and a reality-show format like the campaign means a news-a-second phenomenon like Trump automatically gets free publicity...

The government at that precise moment had all the leverage not just with AIG but with 10-15 other firms similarly about to collapse. It could have initiated all sorts of reforms. Instead it began a pattern of total capitulation that instantly gave back all that leverage. https://t.co/vfHH0GcITe
Instead of leaving management of insolvent firms in place, there should have been an immediate PECORA style commission that identified - and where necessary, criminally prosecuted - guilty executives. https://t.co/vfHH0GcITe

Yeah - no. Can’t stress enough that this was not the case. Firms like Countrywide and New Century couldn’t give out loans fast enough and they didn’t care if you could pay. The loans went right back out the door and ended up in some sucker’s portfolio as RMBS ten minutes later. https://t.co/n8p7hgsCWD
I’m going to cut you off: no. It had nothing to do with housing policy. It happened because new derivative products allowed junk-rated mortgages to be pooled and repackaged as AAA-rated securities. The loans were made en masse because they could be quickly resold for profit. https://t.co/os3ewsfvaf

“My opponent is upset with the Koch brothers because they’re the only ones who take more corporate tax loopholes than she does.” Cuomo, re Nixon. This is getting pretty nasty.
That might be the message, but it would be nice if it were met with a commensurate effort to dial back actual dependence on corporate money. https://t.co/DdOZe3He4P
“We have to take the money out of politics, period,” says Cuomo. https://t.co/dfsAtpmT0o
Cuomo was saved by the bell when Nixon brought up his empowerment of the IDC, and moderators cut her off. I hope this issue gets more play later.
Andrew Cuomo said that the only way he wouldn’t serve four years if re-elected is if God struck him dead. A bit of a surprisingly strong denial that he’s running for President.

I’m talking about the public interest standard that was set for broadcasters as part of the 1934 Communications Act. The whole point of my article is that I totally disbelieve in a “public interest” censorship regime. I believe in public-interest reporting, not censorship. https://t.co/EJGBFuEwMp
And yet, it makes a huge amount of money off the news business, siphons off most of the ad dollars that used to go to news organizations, and is now meeting with groups like the Atlantic Council to decide what is and is not “authentic” content. https://t.co/eI1hNUQfYG

There are many opinions about Bilal. But the key to me is, if there is a case against him, he has a right to know what it is (or isn't). His suit essentially challenges the idea that the state can make secret judicial determinations about its own citizens. https://t.co/aZPGgMCCDx
This is a really important point - the significance of this case lay in the legal issues. Bilal is a mysterious figure, but the government continues to argue that even an American has no right to question any determinations it has or has not made re him, even lethal ones. https://t.co/ZvnYZInrkK

One of the ways people end up on the list is by algorithm. “We Kill by metadata,” former CIA director Michael Hayden said.	Those hits are called “signature strikes.” Bilal Abdul Kareem believes that is how he got on the list. https://t.co/7SnP7Md0D5
America’s “Kill List” is also known as the “Disposition Matrix.” https://t.co/7SnP7Md0D5
That is one of the key issues of the case. There’s no way to find out if you’ve been approved for “lethal action.” https://t.co/JT9zUDuQku
Key to this case is its potential for precedent. Other rulings involving have said courts have no jurisdiction over the drone program. A similar outcome with an American plaintiff would essentially give presidents limitless authority. https://t.co/9dBVUgkx2f

You’re of course free to look at it that way, but the identity of the plaintiff was irrelevant - if it had gone the wrong way, the case could have essentially given presidents unreviewable authority to assassinate even US citizens. https://t.co/PWcWNG20bC
Sorry, was on the phone. Should have comments from the lawyers soon. https://t.co/KMjZOE6h3g
A federal court has upheld a lawsuit by US citizen Bilal Abdul Kareem, winning the right to challenge his inclusion on our so-called “Kill List.” It’s a blow to the drone program and I will have a larger story coming out about this bizarre case soon.

Moreover the idea that publishing the DNC emails violated trade secrets is another potentially scary precedent. https://t.co/odCeP9IjBr

Vampire squids are pretty small. It would take an awful lot of them. That would be a bad way to go. https://t.co/Kx195Z838G

In the context of the piece, it’s less about the efficacy of “paid communications” than it is about the immediate emphasis on fundraising and the fact that these financial strictures are basically the first line items in the agreement handed to new candidates. https://t.co/QkOKISzNHo

My father started when he was 17 and has always been a great reporter.

Basically. Some people ended up screwed multiple times. Your 401k might have bought shady loans that failed while your tax dollars might have been used to bail out others. https://t.co/Qa8vgbJBn5
This isn’t 1950. Your mortgage isn’t created and held for 30 years by the bank down the street. Giant supermarket originators make loans, then immediately sell them off to be pooled, securitized, and sold again and again. These MBS end up held by hedge funds, pensions, etc. https://t.co/kqgCVKBB5Y
No: Companies like Countrywide gave loans to anything with a pulse, then immediately resold them to be packaged as securities to institutional investors. Nobody forced them to lend to unworthy borrowers - they did it because it made huge profits. Investors took the losses. https://t.co/kqgCVKBB5Y

Yes, but it doesn’t follow that Americans who are antiwar and oppose nuclear weapons are aping Russian propaganda/doing the work of the enemy. https://t.co/9qUjcRNPjy

It is an extremely strange book. Comey’s explanations of both the reopening of the HRC investigation and his quarrel with Trump are full of rhetorical oddities that will infuriate both camps/parties. https://t.co/4qgGVbFUHi
Comey’s book contains multiple odd references to his reluctance to prosecute Martha Stewart - dismissing the case initially because he had matters to deal with “more important than a rich person trying to sell some stock before it crashed.”
Jim Comey’s book, “A Higher Loyalty,” is so far light on revelations, but it’s a strange and very interesting character study about a person who seems to be terminally wrestling with questions of conscience and sincerity.
James Comey in his new book describes attending a 2017 Congressional hearing as being “like having Thanksgiving dinner with a family eating together by court order.”

You’re talking about someone who wrote multiple BOOKS trashing the Republican Party, including one subtitled, “Toppling the Big Myths of Republican Politics.” Keep counting tweets. https://t.co/XhX2RMJHPN
But “anywhere” probably means Fox, the Daily Caller, the Washington Times, etc. What outlets you would find credible would do that reporting? https://t.co/yJe0HdSOmx
More to the point, exactly. https://t.co/uiJcfmfOg2
I’m saying exactly the opposite - reporters need to keep all sides honest and can’t just hit one party over and over again. It completely delegitimizes outlets when they do that. And you’re nuts if you think Greenwald doesn’t criticize Republicans constantly. https://t.co/gx6bUU71Pp
