@SeptemberDresan @justinamash Except a wall isn’t a radical alternative treatment. Open borders is not a necessary or viable treatment option.
@SeptemberDresan @justinamash But it is still an emergency. Illegal immigration happens one person at a time sometimes they all just decide to invade at the same time like more than one cancer cell. And by the way cancer is a multifaceted disease as well.
@justinamash Depends on the ermergency. A cancer diagnose with years to live still requires emergency chemo treatment to stop the spread. Kind of like stopping the spread of illegal immigration. Do you prefer not to treat a cancer? #BuildTheWall

@BreitbartNews There goes any motivation for people. Aspire to have success however one determines that for themselves (happiness, chatty,health wealth love) stop telling me what to think. Think she is 2 years and done in the house.
@HardballChris Any good attorney would tell @MichaelCohen212 to keep his mouth shut. If he is caught in any more lies he goes to jail for longer. It’s not About threats it’s about listening to his lawyer. #CohenTestimony Not that Cohen would know much about being a good attorney.

@BreitbartNews Mail it in and Do #SOTU offsite - if @SpeakerPelosi doesn't want it in House.  Not only can you fill venue with supporters, but #Democrats should have no opportunity to respond to it since they did not want to hear it in the House anyway.

@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch Agreed. Everytime @realDonaldTrump oneups the news, dems or libs there is a hit piece out about him.  Look at the timing of all these events.  He oneups @SpeakerPelosi and then there is a @MichaelCohen212 story - from a known liar.
@JackPosobiec @TomFitton No it doesn't fit @CNN narrative. #mediabias
@hardball So questions about a situation first and then a hit job based on the answers. Timing is interesting. Look forward to hearing more evidence and facts from third parties not someone who lies about everything. Cohen tapes everything and then not this bombshell stuff. Interesting.
@king_jeremy_b @thehill @MichaelCohen212 The New York rules of professional conduct governing attorneys require him to disclose such illegal activities when they occurred. Cohen lacks credibility. He pled guilty to lying. Question becomes when is he not lying. He only remembers this now. Conveniently.
@thehill Guy will say anything to shorten his prison sentence. If it were true under attorney ethics he was obligated to disclose it when it happened. #MichaelCohen #Liar story would seem slightly more believable if #CNN broke it cmon @MichaelCohen212 tweet about this.

@1982Firefox @HardballChris @SenMajLdr Spending bills are not going to be voted on because there is neither a deal nor terms of negotiation. Even if McConnell brought them to the floor, Trump wont sign them. There is unity on both sides. but pelosi rather talk about the SOTU rather than funding govt and go on vacation
@Bargainista89 I think Congress can impeach, but they cannot indict - that responsibility is for a different branch of government.
