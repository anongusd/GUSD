4/ The spirit here is communitarian, a plea for mutual respect, a rejection of complacency about the status quo. The accent is on freeing the oppressed. Worth thinking about in the ongoing polemics -- readings almost perfectly suited to the moment.
3/ The Gospel was from Luke 1:	He has anointed me 	to bring glad tidings to the poor.	He has sent me to proclaim liberty to captives	and recovery of sight to the blind,	to let the oppressed go free,	and to proclaim a year acceptable to the Lord.
2/ The reading from 1 Corinthians 12 was the classic about all of us being members of "the same body."	"If one part suffers, all the parts suffer with it;	if one part is honored, all the parts share its joy."

This is the view of a leading new moderate House Democrat. The idea that serious negotiations about immigration issues should not happen under the gun of the shutdown is widely held among Democrats. https://t.co/gYY1vDax6h
She was a truly lovely and deeply thoughtful woman. RIP https://t.co/0Hq44LkIj7
And by the way, nothing #Trump said justifies keeping federal workers off the job and without pay. Even if you take him completely seriously, all the issues he raised should be negotiated in a normal way while the government functions normally.
Struck that #Trump and the GOP are acting as if the voters did not give Democrats control of the House: We'll just keep negotiating among ourselves, as we did before 2018, and the Dems can take it or leave it.	McConnell once again is operating as Trump's agent.
Now there's an idea, Karen! https://t.co/XeF5jAa2Aw

I do not see an obvious way out of the #TrumpShutdown. #Trump is clearly enjoying it &amp; figures that by being wildly unreasonable, reasonable people will feel pressure to give in to end it. But Dems cannot give in because doing so would reward this irresponsible hostage taking.

The revolt in Trump country should petrify Republicans. #Trump's hold on the white working class is weakening. Democrats are filled with energy. And all the right wing money and attack ads couldn't stop #ConorLamb. My column on #PA18  https://t.co/0V7FSubOL0
#Trump put his standing on the line in #PA18. He lost. Republicans threw every attack in their political arsenal at #ConorLamb. They fell short. Many blue-collar voters wanted to come home to the Dems. Lamb opened the door for them. My column https://t.co/QJEr9mivGg
The three takeaways from #PA18 from @ThePlumLineGS	1. The	House map probably just got broader.	2. The #Trump/GOP agenda may be a big albatross for Republicans.	3. Democrats can do better among blue-collar whites.  https://t.co/pLbNpvwYla
"#Trump has the worst Cabinet ever."	@JRubinBlogger makes the case. Persuasively. https://t.co/n29U28eGzG
The losers in #PA18: #Trump, #PaulRyan, the GOP tax cuts, conservative PACs.	Winners: The anti-Trump movement but also disillusioned Trump voters who thought he'd deliver tangible benefits to struggling Americans. Also the unions. And #ConorLamb. My column https://t.co/nfOYU8H5Ic
#ConorLamb's breakthrough should petrify Republicans. The staunchest anti-#Trump voters are clearly prepared to vote for Democratic candidates no matter their ideology. Trump’s grip on less affluent white voters has clearly weakened. My column on #PA18 https://t.co/eoG8asVjjn
My friend @NormOrnstein observed to me this morning that the same Republicans who were casting #ConorLamb  as a left-winger a couple of weeks ago now insist that he's really a conservative. Funny how 113,813 or so voters can put everything in a new light.
Just a hunch but I think Democratic strategists are cheering that #PaulRyan has decided to double down on #Trump. If Ryan really thinks (and who knows what he really thinks) that Trump is an asset, his party will be in a world of hurt. https://t.co/wsx5wghLD8

#Trump's real constituency isn't the working class. He's serving super rich people like himself. And a GOP that would ask #HillaryClinton to disclose every penny of her high school earnings from lawn mowing or babysitting doesn't demand Trump's tax returns	https://t.co/lBbClPxgj7
To borrow from #Trump, he could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and still not lose Ryan or McConnell (Ky.) as long as they have a reactionary tax bill to push into law. My column	https://t.co/lBbClPxgj7
