The Eleventh District is based in Arlington, Alexandria, and inner-most Fairfax County. This district was Obama +38 and Clinton +53(!). Beyer would not have a competitive race here in 2020 or ever. This is the most Democratic District.
The Tenth District is based in outer Fairfax County. This district was Obama +18 and Clinton +33. This would not be compeitive for Connolly in 2020.
The Ninth District is based in the exburbs of DC. This district was Obama +16 and Clinton +25. This would not be compeitive for newly elected Wexton in 2020.
The Eightth District is based in the Shandedoah Valley. This district was McCain +7 and Trump +15. This would have a competitive primary between Riggleton and Cline who reside in this district. The general election would not be compeitive.
The Seventh District is based in the most outer exurbs of DC and much of the Virginia eastern border with Maryland. This district was McCain +7 and Trump +13. This would not be too compeitive for Whitman in 2020.
The Sixth District is based in Richmond and Henrico counties and some rural areas. This district was Obama +13 and Clinton +18. This would not be a compeitive race for either Spanberger or McEachin (both of which live in this district).
The Fifth District is north and east of the Fourth District. This district was Obama +26 and Clinton +25. This district is unlikely to be compeitive for Bobby Scott should he run in 2020.
The Fourth District is based in southeastern Virginia and the island part. This district was Obama +2 and Trump +1. Luria might live in this district, but is almost certain to run in this compeitive district unless Bobby Scott were to retire in 2020.
The Third District is based in eastern Virginia and western Richmond suburbs. It is unlikey that any representative lives in this district. This would be the most compeitive seat in 2020 and was McCain +1 and Trump +3.
The Second District is based in south-central Virginia. This district was McCain+11 and Trump +20 respectivly. This district would probably have a competitive since Griffith hasn't represented a majority of this district before. This district would not be compeitive in 2020.
The First District is based in Southwestern Virginia. This district was McCain +19 and Trump +42. There would be a primary to elect a new representative since Griffith would be redistricted into the Second Congressional District, but would not be competitive in 2020.
For my second map I decided to do a redistricting of Virginia. This isn't a pretty map, but I believe that it looks better than the current map. Under this map both Obama and Trump would have won a majority of the districts. https://t.co/CgHW40M7KG

@RebekahRStevens @NMLeg4All @postsbybrandon @NewMexicoYRs I don‚Äôt live in New Mexico, I just want to know why this is important rather than just focus on policy.
@MWMPolitics @PNWwonk We have US History here in 8th. There was limited focus on government. I go to Public in a subrural community. We should add current events to these classes and maybe even offer a class on Current Events alone (which schools might already do)
@MWMPolitics @PNWwonk I‚Äôm basing it off of psychology. I believe that kids can be informed (look at us) but I believe that lowering the voting age may be a mistake.

@samzhang428 Usually they perform worse, when you‚Äôre against a Trump-style candidate it doesn‚Äôt matter as much.
@samzhang428 She did well in Metro Atlanta and terrible in rural areas. There‚Äôs more policies but that was one of the main issues people had with her.
@_alex_joshua Big things
@samzhang428 Her policies on guns were too progressive for Georgia
@samzhang428 The fact that she ran as an unapologetic progressives
@samzhang428 Abrams was definitely not a moderate üòÇ
@samzhang428 It‚Äôs likely to change this time also why doesn‚Äôt Harris play well in suburbs? She‚Äôs not Sanders
@MWMPolitics @PNWwonk Oh okay I see where you‚Äôre coming from. My problem with letting minors vote is that we evolve our positions still (I used to be very right wing two years ago). I think we should hold off until a person can take civics. Colleges should help with voting turnout.
@MWMPolitics @PNWwonk Peer-pressure also the fact that 15 year olds don‚Äôt care about politics. Voting will be confusing for all first time voters. Idk how to fix turnout for 18 year olds though
@samzhang428 Democrats did really well in Georgia. The electorate may be more conservative but it doesn‚Äôt matter because it will also be more minority. Also Democrats were able to flip many Surbuban counties.
@samzhang428 With a higher portion of the population being minority then it‚Äôs not representative. Also DeSantis has the benefit of running in an election that had older Cuban voters. Trump will be in an election with all Latino voters
@samzhang428 This is a midterm exit poll (minority turnout was much lower) also in what sense does Latino turnout help Trump? Trump is the worst candidate for Republicans in the minds of Latinos (even Cubans)
@samzhang428 Stacey Abrams was an awful candidate (Georgians didn‚Äôt like her that much) and how is higher minority turnout helping Trump?
@MWMPolitics @PNWwonk That‚Äôs too young to vote in a presidential election. 18 is good enough
@CoolTrumplican @samzhang428 Yeah Trump isn‚Äôt McCain though. Also Georgia has a higher minority population compared to 2008 (Also McCain performed better than Trump)
@samzhang428 It‚Äôs too far out to trust polling, Georgia isn‚Äôt that inelastic (Trump is unpopular in the suburbs and higher minority turnout), and Florida has high Latino population plus suburbs and minority turnout.

I was a part of TPUSA (I‚Äôm not ashamed to admit this because I learned how bad this org was) and I stand behind this statement. @RealCandaceO was surrounding by controversy when she was hired (doxxing website) and had a history of being an awful person (Blaire White debate) https://t.co/wP5RgyX9zH
@ProvidenceAve @NameIsJosephine From what I‚Äôve gathered, the national organization tends to ignore the leaders of college chapters. I believe they had to go public for TPUSA to listen to them.
@dneilmckay @amyklobuchar Pandering has always been my main pet peeve in politics since the person who is pandering would have to rely on stereotypes.
@AOC So it‚Äôs literally your way or the highway? You represent the type of politicians that many Americans hate. Those who disagree with you are not ‚Äúshouting from the cheap seats‚Äù

@somegizmo @thedemonicalien @BishConnell @Nagles_A_Fraud @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @ReaganBattalion Let‚Äôs not forget I was 14 when he got the nomination. I started following politics at 13
@somegizmo @thedemonicalien @BishConnell @Nagles_A_Fraud @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @ReaganBattalion I never supported a racist candidate. I supported moderate Republicans.

@thedemonicalien @somegizmo @BishConnell @Nagles_A_Fraud @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @ReaganBattalion Did I ever say that I agreed with any of this or did I say it‚Äôs complicated (because it truly is)

@thedemonicalien @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @Nagles_A_Fraud @ReaganBattalion I read it and it‚Äôs not that convincing. Though I do see his point. However he‚Äôs being too simplistic.
@thedemonicalien @Nagles_A_Fraud @hasya23 @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @ReaganBattalion You literally were the one complaining that I used The NY Times as a source. I look at all of your sources.

@hellthread @Nagles_A_Fraud @thedemonicalien @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @ReaganBattalion And the Cuban Revolution led to many Cubans fleeing to the US. You should talk to those who immigrate here from Cuba (especially those who came here during and after the revolution).
@somegizmo @thedemonicalien @BishConnell @Nagles_A_Fraud @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @ReaganBattalion Cuba is not a social democracy. They‚Äôre not even a democracy.
@BishConnell @somegizmo @thedemonicalien @Nagles_A_Fraud @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @ReaganBattalion Part of it was that. Another issue was the failed Bay of Pigs. This turned oddly many Cuban voters. Many Cuban tend to be moderate not right wing.
@thedemonicalien @somegizmo @BishConnell @Nagles_A_Fraud @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @ReaganBattalion Yes and Democrats are also guilty of gerrymandering. Both parties should be involved equally in drawing lines and there should be no voter purging. ID laws are a bit more complicated though.
@thedemonicalien @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @Nagles_A_Fraud @ReaganBattalion Let me address your point first and then I‚Äôll read the thread. No right-wing (which a majority of Cubans are simply not) are not inherently racist.
@thedemonicalien @Nagles_A_Fraud @hasya23 @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @ReaganBattalion I don‚Äôt sympathize with anybody. I just don‚Äôt live in an echo chamber like you do.

@somegizmo @BishConnell @thedemonicalien @Nagles_A_Fraud @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @ReaganBattalion I mean they won elections recently so...
@somegizmo @thedemonicalien @Nagles_A_Fraud @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @ReaganBattalion A country who truly cares about what their citizens want
@thedemonicalien @somegizmo @Nagles_A_Fraud @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @ReaganBattalion In what country is it natural for one party to win every seat in the legislature?
@thedemonicalien @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @Nagles_A_Fraud @ReaganBattalion Imagine thinking the worse of your political opposition. Most Republicans are not white supremacists. That‚Äôs being intellectually dishonest
@somegizmo @BishConnell @thedemonicalien @Nagles_A_Fraud @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @ReaganBattalion And why many Cubans are Republican
@thedemonicalien @Nagles_A_Fraud @hasya23 @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @ReaganBattalion I love that you brought up LGBTQ. Do you want to know Castro‚Äôs stance on the LGBTQ community? Also no I don‚Äôt support him.
@thedemonicalien @somegizmo @Nagles_A_Fraud @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @ReaganBattalion So you don‚Äôt like choice right? You can only vote for one party. Most people don‚Äôt want to move to Cuba because of how impoverished they are.
@Nagles_A_Fraud @thedemonicalien @hasya23 @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @ReaganBattalion Yes. Your point?
@thedemonicalien @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @Nagles_A_Fraud @ReaganBattalion Welp they‚Äôre Cuban. They came here for a reason. Cubans are conservatives (usually don‚Äôt support white nationalists). I wonder why they vote Republican

@thedemonicalien @Nagles_A_Fraud @hasya23 @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @ReaganBattalion Yet Cubans prefer to work in Brazil because they make more money.
@thedemonicalien @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @Nagles_A_Fraud @ReaganBattalion I hold the opinions of Cuban Americans are little higher than yours. Many Cubans want Cuba to be an actual democracy.

@thedemonicalien @1776PH @szyzk3 @SocialSam4 @Nagles_A_Fraud @ReaganBattalion Yep my ‚Äúteachers‚Äù were Cuban immigrants.  I trust them over you (someone who should be thankful they don‚Äôt live there.)

Hey thanks for proving you‚Äôre an idiot who doesn‚Äôt understand Cuba.		Signed a grandson of Cuban Refugees. https://t.co/lQYXraZoQ1
@RoastAnatomy I know. I can‚Äôt speak for other states but in the end most states follow a similar policy in exams being 15-25 percent of final grades regardless of subjects.
@dagobruh He improved over Trump with Hispanic voters and he actually tried to win the entire time.
@RoastAnatomy Not in the state of Georgia. Exams are 20% percent regardless of subject (electives get more leeway by doing a project/performance as long as there is also a written assessment)
@MelissaAmour72 Ileana Ros-Leithen, M√≠a Love,
@RoastAnatomy Teachers don‚Äôt have a say in how much a final is worth. They don‚Äôt have the power that professors have, sadly. If teachers were able to do classes like professors are then I‚Äôll be more open to a final being worth a lot.
@RoastAnatomy That‚Äôs reasonable but 20% is simply too much.
@RoastAnatomy Possibly but there‚Äôs no reason to subject 8th graders (I believe it starts in 6th grade though) to having a fifth of there final grade be determined by a 50-75 question test.
@RoastAnatomy Rubio?
@RoastAnatomy So why not get someone who has a similar ideology to Trump who‚Äôs not full of themselves? Especially someone knowledgeable about how the government works.
@RoastAnatomy I don‚Äôt remember reviewing in a college course 1/4 of the time. Nor do exams count for 20% of the final score.
RT @w_terrence: Hey guys! It‚Äôs hard typing this. I have fractured neck and back some spine issues. My lyft Driver almost flew off the bridg‚Ä¶
@postsbybrandon @NMLeg4All @BrianEgolf @NMHouseDems Apparently it is given their non-response.
@ADaftGentleman @ChodeCaptain @ReaganBattalion Okay then you can support a candidate who praises programs from communists countries and I‚Äôll support a candidate who has a great platform and can actually win.
@SenhorRaposa Same. He was even afraid to debate his primary challenger
@ReaganBattalion No! Release them closer to the Iowa caucus.
@ADaftGentleman @ChodeCaptain @ReaganBattalion Not really. If my goal was to get Trump to lose at all costs, I would be supporting any candidates regardless of outcome. I‚Äôm not supporting Sanders, Gabbard, or Warren
@RoastAnatomy Bad visual, but I like her platform and her ability to be realistic with people. Plus I‚Äôm thinking New President or Trump. I really don‚Äôt want Trump. I‚Äôll take Weld though.
@RoastAnatomy The teachers I have are required to teach so much material in a short amount of time (like we‚Äôre taking Mock AP exams already) because they have to review. I believe getting rid of exams (or reducing the pressure of taking the test) would be effective as well.
@RoastAnatomy Most of the problem doesn‚Äôt come from teachers though.
@RoastAnatomy I think Klobuchar is the strongest one currently (Midwestern appeal) but I think Biden has the best chance overall
@RoastAnatomy I almost failed my testing in 4th Grade and two years later I got a perfect score (it was the same subject)
@RoastAnatomy Oh I thought you were talking the national standards. My issue with standardized test is that teachers are teaching to a specific test. Unless we go to nationwide standards, students who move a lot.
@ADaftGentleman @ChodeCaptain @ReaganBattalion I‚Äôm not a blob üòÇ. I‚Äôm realistic, if i want Trump to lose in 2020 then obviously I want the best candidate running. I also support Weld (I‚Äôm not a Democrat). I have my beliefs and one of them is supporting realistic candidates.
@ADaftGentleman @ChodeCaptain @ReaganBattalion People are fans of her ideology. I am a fan because she can beat Trump. Again not ideology. However I do agree with many of her things
@ADaftGentleman @ChodeCaptain @ReaganBattalion Nationwide margin and past performance for an average senator. She ran ahead of both Tina Smith and Governor
@ADaftGentleman @ChodeCaptain @ReaganBattalion Her past in over performing in a swing state.
@ADaftGentleman @ChodeCaptain @ReaganBattalion Yes because winning is totally an ideology and not an ability.
@RoastAnatomy Idk. As long as the four above aren‚Äôt the nominee then I‚Äôm fine.
@RoastAnatomy Yeah it‚Äôs unpopular. I‚Äôm looking at it from my perspective (I moved 5 times in less than 5 years).
@ADaftGentleman @ChodeCaptain @ReaganBattalion Yes because I support someone based off of their eye shadow. No it‚Äôs because she can appeal to Midwestern voters as well as surburnites.
@TheSocialistDr @samhwils @ChodeCaptain @ReaganBattalion I don‚Äôt like the fact that she did that, but I‚Äôm looking at other factors as well.
@AprilMa74912403 @samhwils @ChodeCaptain @ReaganBattalion No I‚Äôm not üòÇ. I‚Äôm sure Sanders has lost his temper. Are we going to discount those staffers who said that she was a great boss?
@ADaftGentleman @ChodeCaptain @ReaganBattalion I‚Äôm not embracing the ideology of anybody. I‚Äôm embracing a candidate that can win in 2020.
@samhwils @ChodeCaptain @ReaganBattalion I see that you prefer to base a politicians career on a single controversy. Should we talk about Bernie‚Äôs?
Just because I don't like a candidate does not mean that I hold the opposite ideology. For example: I am not a right-winger because I refuse to ever vote for Bernie Sanders.
Candidates should explain their position on Venezuela. If they are aganist intervention because the Venezuelans "voted" then they don't deserve your vote.
I support the electoral college, but it needs to be reformed. I prefer just counting House seats using the Wyoming method and not counting senate elections. This would create a more representative voting system.
Trump is an underdog in the 2020 election. Unless he's up against Bernie, Gabbard, Warren, or Gillibrand, he is more likely than not going to lose.
Both parties are guilty of gerrymandering.
I don't support supermajorities in state legistlatures. I believe that they create a more partisan enviorment whereas states that are more competitive are more bipartisan.
The main reason we do not see changes to the norm is because of negativity. "Weld won't beat Trump" is going to be one of the main reasons he does not win (if this does happen)
Advocacy Groups based on idenity suck. Especially ones that are only empowering those who are progressive/conservative. The Hispanic Congressional Causus is partisan and does not actually work to strengthen Latino voices. Only those who are Democrats (see @carloslcurbelo)
Democratic Socialist Association and The Tea Party are not the only representatives of each party, they just have the loudest voices.
Schools need to teach better courses and I do support a national circulum. I believe that Common Core had good intentions, but it was put together too quickly. Also I am against standardized testing.
I support teaching Government for an entire year. There is no reason for the class to be taught in under 5 months. I feel like many people do not understand how the government work. For example: many people said that they would vote against David Perdue in 2018 (he's up in 2020)
Partisan voting is a problem and many people are guilty of it.	Not all Republicans are bad	Not all Democrats are bad	Both parties have terrible politicians and amazing politicians.
University should never be free.	Application should always be free.	Community College should be affordable (and free for lower-income levels)
There is no such thing as a spoiler candidate. That's an excuse as to why a party lost an election. The candidate should have done a better job in reaching out to those who voted for another candidate.

@mjdawidowicz @RosLehtinen You work with the other side to gain support.
@mjdawidowicz @RosLehtinen No it doesn‚Äôt. Not at all. I don‚Äôt support Republicans on many issues and in fact I supported their Democratic challengers in the next election. I supported Governor Hogan who is far from being an extremist.
@mjdawidowicz @RosLehtinen Because the world doesn‚Äôt revolve around what you and your allies want. The government works for everyone, not just for the people you think it should work for.
@mjdawidowicz @RosLehtinen And I‚Äôm saying that you are not tolerant of opposing viewpoints because you aren‚Äôt
@mjdawidowicz @RosLehtinen Because it‚Äôs not all about what you want.
@mjdawidowicz @RosLehtinen I agree with ostracizing people based off extreme values, but being a Republican isn‚Äôt extreme. Also you admitted to wanting to humiliate those who support Republicans in anyway.
@mjdawidowicz @RosLehtinen I mean civil discourse is a good thing. I‚Äôve always supported working with both sides. I mean look where we are being uncivil to those with opposing viewpoints.

@PrdNewEnglander @ArtfulButler @aseemru @Redistrict Ok. I just assumed by his twitter handle that he created it.
@SenhorRaposa @Redistrict Thank You.
I specifically created this as a Toss Up district due to the gerrymandering that took place here. Also this would be my district.
@ArtfulButler @aseemru @Redistrict I‚Äôm assuming so.
@TossupReport @SenhorRaposa @DrewSutton20 @_alex_joshua @aseemru @2019politics_ @ChazNuttycombe @politico_chris @JMilesColeman Also I didn‚Äôt think about DeKalb county. I will make sure to remember that in the future.
@TossupReport @SenhorRaposa @DrewSutton20 @_alex_joshua @aseemru @2019politics_ @ChazNuttycombe @politico_chris @JMilesColeman Thank You. There are 2 Black Majority Districts, 3 Minority Majority Districts, and 2 Districts with &lt;55% White majority Districts.
@aseemru Thanks!
@AsInMarx I partially did so I could create more Toss Up/Lean D districts. If Dems were to win then it would be a Minority Choice Candidate in all Safe Democrats Seats as well as Districts 4, 11, and 14 and potentially in District 3.
@SenhorRaposa @DrewSutton20 @_alex_joshua @aseemru @2019politics_  @ChazNuttycombe @politico_chris @JMilesColeman what do you guys think about this map?
Overall Democrats would be competitive in Districts 3, 7, 11, and 14 while having Safe/Likely Seats in Districts 4, 6, 8, and 10. McCain won 8 to Obama's 6 and I think Hillary and Trump would have both carried 7 districts a piece.
Rick Allen would probably lose reelection in this district due to some of his past comments. Though a Republican can win this district. Obama carried it 50.4-49.
The Fourthteen Congressional District is located in East District, contains Augusta and Athens. This district would be cosidered a Toss Up (maybe Lean DEM in 2018). Turnout would be the key in elections in this district between Augusta Suburbs and Urban Ares
The Thirthteen Congressional District is based in south-central Georgia. This would have been won by McCain 62.1-37.3 and be considered a Safe GOP seat. No Congressional Rep lives in this district, although Austin Scott may run here.
The Twelfth Congressional District contains much of coastal Georgia, including Savannah, and would have backed McCain 55-44.4. This would be Likely GOP in 2018. Buddy Carter would need to work a bit harder to win reelection in this district.
The Eleventh Congressional District is south of the Tenth and goes through Houston County, includes Macon, this district would be Toss Up (maybe lean Dem in 2018) since parts of this district are becoming more Blue. (50.4-49 Obama) Austin Scott would have to work harder to win
The Tenth Congressional District would be considered Safe DEM backing Obama 73.6-25.9. John Lewis might run in this District since it contains some of his current territory. This District Contains portians of Clayton, DeKalb, and Henry Counties and all of Newton and Rockdale.
The Nineth Congressional District would be considered Safe GOP since it backed McCain 71.7-27.3. This District contains Cherokee County, Forsyth County, and a portion of Gwinnett County. Rob Woodall (I think) and Barry Loundermilk would run for this district.
The Eighth Congressional District would contain Parts of DeKalb and Gwinnett County and would be considered a Safe DEM seat. This district backed Obama 64.6-34.7. Hank Johnson would win reelection in this district.
The Seventh Congressional District would contain northern Fulton County, northern DeKalb County, as well as eastern Gwinnett County. This district would be considered a Toss Up although the district did back McCain 53.5-45.7. No one from the Georgia Congressional Reps live here.
The Sixth Congressional District contains all of Douglas, Central and Southern Atlanta, as well as a preinct in Cobb, this is a Safe Dem seat which voted for Obama 78.8-20.6. This seat may have a primary between John Lewis and David Scott though.
The Fifth Congressional District would be Safe GOP and is located north of the Fourth District. This district voted for McCain 66.8-32.4. Drew Ferguson will be able to get reelected in this district.
The Fourth Congressional District would be Toss Up in theory, but Sanford Bishop would likely get reelected with no problem. This district is in Southwestern Georgia, contains the city of Columbus, and voted for Obama 50.2-49.3.
@burningpalefire @270needed I didn‚Äôt know that. I wish they didn‚Äôt.
@Mike1332Mike @GayRepublicSwag How mature. I‚Äôm using my laptop that I own for college. I guess you have to result to insults since all you have is anecdotal evidence. Apparently you know how all Ohioans feel about Kasich.
The Third Congressional District would be considered a Toss Up now, but before Trump's election it would have been Safe GOP. While McCain won this district 54.4-44.6, Trump would have lost this district. This district is based in Cobb County.
The Second District would also be considered Safe GOP. It voted for McCain 72.4-26.4 so Tom Graves will be able to keep this seat for as long as he wants it. This districe is based in Northwestern Georgia
The First District consists of multiple northeastern counties in Georgia. This would be considered a Safe GOP seat. McCain would have won this seat 74-25 over Obama. Two GOP Congressman live in this district though (Doug Collins and Jody Hice)
This is my first map for #ElectionTwitter . I did a redistricting of Georgia based off of the data from @Redistrict's Dave's Redistricting App. I am going to do all states that will get multiple districts, but I wanted to start with my home state. 1/? https://t.co/csIweyd7Bf

@_alex_joshua Don't say anything to @GOP but many Hispanic Republicans can't speak Spanish. I am Cuban and I am still learning how to speak Spanish. It's a bad attack against a candidate who won't even be the Democrat Nominee.
@ElectionMapsCo Yep, great choice on the election part.
@ElectionMapsCo It‚Äôs hard to show gerrymandering on a national stage due to the many deep blue and red districts (The ones that are not gerrymandered),  but I think this map does show that there is an issue

My ancestors were not here during that time period, so how should I take responsibility for an injustice that I have literally no connection to.
@lander @Michael2014abc @SailorStorm86 Never denied that again I looked at race and education combined not just education.
@lander @Michael2014abc @SailorStorm86 Educated non-whites were less likely to vote Democrat than non-educated non-whites. Look at the chart and do the math.
@lander @SailorStorm86 @LapThis @Michael2014abc @j_cogen @extradeadly @DagachDanyal @ZFed116 @TheRoot I do understand the difference. Do you understand that I can‚Äôt do anything about it because I can‚Äôt control what happened two centuries ago? I don‚Äôt know what you are expecting of me. I‚Äôm grateful to be in this country where I have freedoms that many Cubans don‚Äôt.
@lander @Michael2014abc @SailorStorm86 My chart literally proves my point. Where does it not.
@lander @SailorStorm86 @LapThis @Michael2014abc @j_cogen @extradeadly @DagachDanyal @ZFed116 @TheRoot And my ancestors had nothing to do with that. Accept the fact that I can‚Äôt feel guilty about the fact that many family participated in this, when in reality they didn‚Äôt.
@SailorStorm86 @LapThis @lander @Michael2014abc @j_cogen @extradeadly @DagachDanyal @ZFed116 @TheRoot I mean I‚Äôm flattered that you think that you know who I am, but face it, you don‚Äôt. I call out racism when I see it, and I believe that anybody can experience racism.
@SailorStorm86 @LapThis @lander @Michael2014abc @j_cogen @extradeadly @DagachDanyal @ZFed116 @TheRoot I do care about legitimate racism. My family was met by anti-immigrant rhetoric when they got here. To downplay how hard they worked is very ignorant. For example, not all Cubans are white.
@lander @Michael2014abc @SailorStorm86 Yes, which was my entire point. Whites with an education vote more for democrats than whites without degrees. However for minorities it‚Äôs the complete opposite.
Ignorance at its finest. https://t.co/6B8OWlVN8g
@SailorStorm86 @LapThis @lander @Michael2014abc @j_cogen @extradeadly @DagachDanyal @ZFed116 @TheRoot My family fled Cuba and Ireland (revolution and famine) and took no part in exploitation. They worked very hard for everything they have. It‚Äôs not all black and white like you think it is.
@lander @Michael2014abc @SailorStorm86 No I said they are more likely to vote more Republican than minorities without a college education.
@SailorStorm86 @LapThis @lander @Michael2014abc @j_cogen @extradeadly @DagachDanyal @ZFed116 @TheRoot Being expected to pay reparations for an event that a currently-living white person had no part in.
@lander @Michael2014abc @SailorStorm86 Non-whites with a degree we‚Äôre Dem +50 whereas those without a degree were Dem +56. My claim is that those with a degree then to favor Republicans. Not that a majority supports Republicans but ok.
@SailorStorm86 @LapThis @lander @Michael2014abc @j_cogen @extradeadly @DagachDanyal @ZFed116 @TheRoot So I prove you wrong and now you choose to once again change the subject. I will point out that I have never said white people experienced slavery in this country. Today any race can experience racism.

@SailorStorm86 @LapThis @lander @Michael2014abc @j_cogen @extradeadly @DagachDanyal @ZFed116 @TheRoot Are black people slaves? Segregated? etc. Things have changed over time.
@lander @Michael2014abc @SailorStorm86 I read that already. Again there are uneducated liberals and educated conservatives. Also minorities with an higher education tend to be more Republican leaning.
@SailorStorm86 @LapThis @lander @Michael2014abc @j_cogen @extradeadly @DagachDanyal @ZFed116 @TheRoot Then what is it? If I were to call all black people racist because of the fact that they are black, what does that make me.
@Michael2014abc @lander @SailorStorm86 It goes both ways. I‚Äôve met both educated and uneducated liberals and the same goes with conservatives. It just depends which one fits their narrative.
@SailorStorm86 @LapThis @lander @Michael2014abc @j_cogen @extradeadly @DagachDanyal @ZFed116 @TheRoot Imo, as according to your definition, calling a group racist based off of their race is racist.
@lander @Michael2014abc @SailorStorm86 There are highly educated Democrats and Republicans so what‚Äôs your point. In fact educated minorities are more likely to vote Republican than non-educated minorities.
@SailorStorm86 @LapThis @lander @Michael2014abc @j_cogen @extradeadly @DagachDanyal @ZFed116 @TheRoot I would say calling a group of people as a whole racist, when most of them are not racist, is pretty racist.

@SailorStorm86 @Sloopyinca @DagachDanyal @extradeadly @ZFed116 @TheRoot So your argument is that the definition is left up to the person. So imo you are wrong.

@SailorStorm86 @DagachDanyal @Sloopyinca @extradeadly @ZFed116 @TheRoot And using terms like colonizer etc. are ad hominems. Your questions were answered. Native tribes enslaved other tribes. They also stole land, resources etc. which were fight over in conflicts.

WTF! Ok seriously I‚Äôm mad about this win. We had great candidates lose and Trump mocked them. The GOP was silent. But they don‚Äôt mind congratulating a racist. https://t.co/h5mx4DRLms
@RNCLatinos Why would I? I would‚Äôve voted for @espyforsenate . @cindyhydesmith wants to make it harder for younger people to vote and said she would attend a public lynching! This isn‚Äôt the GOP I remember.
@StrawPollReport Republicans winning by 10 in MS is a good result for Democrats.
@GilverPrime @LadyLiberation_ He doesn‚Äôt believe in Civil Rights for African Americans. He thought Whites were surperior. Regardless of laws that Democrats passed, he was still racist like most people during that time period were.
@politicsluo No. Just no.
@politicobsessed CHS +5.6%
@GilverPrime @LadyLiberation_ Not what I meant. Lincoln didn‚Äôt believe in civil rights.
@LadyLiberation_ I hate the Lincoln argument. He was still racist. He didn‚Äôt believe in equal rights at all.

@DrNat01 @SenhorRaposa I‚Äôm just saying that Plymouth isn‚Äôt really a Republican leaning county. When‚Äôs the last time a Republican carried it in a Presidential race?
@DrNat01 @SenhorRaposa People in Broward County FL are represented by a Republican State Sen and Rep. Broward county isn‚Äôt Red. Same with Dade County, FL
@DrNat01 @SenhorRaposa I guess by Massachusetts standards.
@SenhorRaposa That‚Äôs true, but it‚Äôs still a blue leaning county. It‚Äôll be like if Virginia went red this cycle (assuming they nominated an actual candidate who wasn‚Äôt racist). It‚Äôs shocking
@samzhang428 That Cuban comment irks me. Do they know why Cubans are leaning Republican? I don‚Äôt know about you but I‚Äôm tired of being called racist because I don‚Äôt support a Democrat.

@sportsandbutter What website is this.
@ChazNuttycombe Leave the voting age at 18. No need to raise or lower it.
@The_LS_Project @SenorZorros I am arguing based on maturity of the person. A lot of that comes from understanding complex issues. And again maturity increases with age.
@The_LS_Project @SenorZorros Yes. Do you understand when I say that the rate of knowledge increases with age? A 4 year olds mind is not developed enough to vote based off what they think is best.
@The_LS_Project @SenorZorros I‚Äôm not saying we should make voting based off the above. I‚Äôm saying teens lack the above statements at a much larger rate than adults. You are speaking in absolutes while ignoring the complexity of this topic.
@The_LS_Project @SenorZorros Ok so name one. What 4 year old can name a reason why we have a large military budget and where the money comes from? Or a war that was fought in the last 20 years and who took part in the war? You may find 1 or 2, but you will find that a vast majority can‚Äôt define ‚Äúdefense‚Äù
@The_LS_Project @SenorZorros That‚Äôs an example. What about say military? Life experience? Maturity? Ability to understand complex issues?
@The_LS_Project @SenorZorros Actually it does. See you are an adult, I‚Äôm assuming, do you know anything about defense, economics, or educational spending? If so can you name a 4 year old who knows anything about the mentioned topics.
@The_LS_Project @SenorZorros ??? My point is that you want teens to vote on things like taxes etc. When they don‚Äôt pay taxes.
@The_LS_Project @SenorZorros Ok name a kid who has the knowledge of issues like defense, economics, education spending? I‚Äôll wait.
@The_LS_Project @SenorZorros ‚ÄùOr, how about requiring younger voters to pass the citizenship test as an incentive and qualifier, tying civic engagement with civic education?‚Äù
@The_LS_Project @SenorZorros ‚ÄúPerhaps it should also be a question of having a real stake in the process‚Äîsuch as serving in the military (age 18, or 17 with parental consent) or writing a check to the government to pay your taxes.‚Äú
@The_LS_Project @SenorZorros Little kids are not mature enough to vote. And before you say not all adults are nature, you should take in account the knowledge of an adult and a kid.
@The_LS_Project Do you think we should allow 4 year olds to vote for president, senate, house etc. elections? They most likely have never heard of those offices before.
@The_LS_Project @SenorZorros So should we allow little kids to vote? I mean it will effect them too.
@The_LS_Project Be more specific then. I mean we could easily say the same for a 4 year old. That doesn‚Äôt mean we should allow 4 year olds to vote.
@The_LS_Project @SenorZorros 14 is really pushing it. The reason why the voting age was lowered to 18 was because the you had 18 year olds fighting in a war, but couldn‚Äôt vote on those policies. So what would be the equivalent for 16 year olds today?
@The_LS_Project Not really. You see adults tend to watch or read the news more, have longer (not necessarily more) life experiences afiche could impact voting. Again why should we let teens vote?
@The_LS_Project @SenorZorros Enough about that topic to vote on it. Most adults don‚Äôt either.
@The_LS_Project @SenorZorros Rights? The constitution gives those 18 and over the right, not 16 and over. Also many people over the age of 30 do have kids in education system means that education will impact them. 16 year olds voting on let‚Äôs say raising the age of gun ownership. I do not think teens know.
@SenorZorros @The_LS_Project 1. Many do have children in education.	2. The main reason schools suck is because we throw money at schools and we see no gain out of it. We should increase either the school day or school year, eliminate standardized testing, and give less homework out.
@The_LS_Project Ok. Then why should they vote? I‚Äôm 16. My peers do not follow politics, so why should we let a group of people who are minors and don‚Äôt follow politics at all vote?
@SenorZorros @The_LS_Project I mean people over 30 do have kids. So voting on educational matters would make sense.
@The_LS_Project But many of the policies that they vote on will not effect them.
@The_LS_Project 1. Civics is taught in High School. If you graduate (as most High Schoolers do) then you took Civics.	2. I‚Äôm not saying they don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm saying that they are less likely too. Sorry if I left the last part out.	3. Most policies effect those 21 and up. Many policies effect teens
@The_LS_Project Yes. Most 16 year olds haven‚Äôt taken Civics yet. Also our brains are not developed enough yet to think far in the future. Don‚Äôt forget that they will be voting for some policies that have no effect on them.

The race hasn‚Äôt been polled since May though.
@consrvtveindian @CaseyCagle @POTUS @VP @BrianKempGA @wsbtv @bluestein @ajc I think it‚Äôs because the poll doesn‚Äôt exist or hasn‚Äôt been released. Considering that the picture above would have 0% undecideds and 0% for the Libertarian candidate my bet is on the poll not existing.

@MelissaRoseanne @Ange_Amene @Polit_eur I understand they are close associates but that‚Äôs only one vote. A lot of Congressional Republicans didn‚Äôt like Trump and I think that they would compromise with Congressman Democrats to elect Evan.
@MelissaRoseanne @Ange_Amene @Polit_eur Ah... I still don‚Äôt think in present day that is needed.
@MelissaRoseanne @Ange_Amene @Polit_eur Not really. I dreaded November because I knew that a candidate I didn‚Äôt like was going to win. If you switched PA, MI, and WI to Clinton, NV to Trump, and UT to McMullin then there was a possibility for McMullin to become president as well.
@MelissaRoseanne @Ange_Amene @Polit_eur Ok. We can agree to disagree with that. I‚Äôm not asking you to follow me. I was more interested as to why you said you didn‚Äôt want to (if that makes sense).
@MelissaRoseanne @Ange_Amene @Polit_eur I think we are in a place to where we can gradually do away with AA. Also there are no Latino colleges that I‚Äôm aware of, but even if there were I would still prefer a college with diversity and who gives all applicants and equal shot at admission
@MelissaRoseanne @Ange_Amene @Polit_eur Was coming from.
@MelissaRoseanne @Ange_Amene @Polit_eur As long as you get minorities from both sides of the political spectrum. Not all minorities hate Trump. In fact the majority of my family voted for him. I didn‚Äôt agree with them, but I was still able to see where they came from as well as seeing where my family who voted Hillary
@MelissaRoseanne @Ange_Amene @Polit_eur Actually I said I was glad Clinton lost because I am glad she lost. I‚Äôm not happy that Trump won. I would rather any other person win the election. Provocative? Not really. I posted it because the OP was talking about minorities will expand someone‚Äôs world. I agree with that
@MelissaRoseanne @Ange_Amene @Polit_eur Yes. The first place was decades ago. Right now we are seeing Asian Americans having to work much harder than other ethnicities to get into the same colleges. Getting rid of AA would make it harder for me to get into a good college, but it would make it fair for everyone.
@Ange_Amene Nope not a bot.
@MelissaRoseanne @Ange_Amene @Polit_eur Even if Russia didn‚Äôt interfere with the election. She and Trump were the worst candidates that the Dems and GOP could‚Äôve nominated. For affirmative action though you are right. I rather get into a good college and get a good job because I earned it. Not because I‚Äôm Latino.
@MelissaRoseanne @Ange_Amene @Polit_eur You might be some stranger, but it doesn‚Äôt matter to me. Dialogue is very important to me. To clarify, I didn‚Äôt want Trump or Clinton to win. 2016 was very frustrating for me due to the candidates who were selected. I only said that I think Trump would‚Äôve beat Clinton
@RealOmarNavarro @RepMimiWalters @AntonioSabatoJr @RepMaxineWaters Uh.... ok. Criticizing @RepMaxineWaters isn‚Äôt only ok for you. I‚Äôm glad @AntonioSabatoJr and @RepMimiWalters are doing that. They are more likely to win than you are.

@The_LS_Project Gay Marriage- For me it was the timing that was fishy. Super Predators- that was why I said her wording was bad.
@The_LS_Project Her statements on Gay Marriage, Immigration, Bosnia, Super Predators etc. Those were either lies, flip flops, or worded badly.
@The_LS_Project Ah. We do disagree there. I saw her as a weak candidate and someone who alienates people. I saw no reason to support her because her health issues, past statements, etc.

@LadyLiberation_ I kind of disagree with you there. I only saw one tweet but what I got from it was character. She‚Äôs right it does speak to the owners character just like the baker who wouldn‚Äôt bake the cakes
@GayRepublicSwag Ok why are we only focus on securing the southern border? We don‚Äôt need a wall. Not only is it a waste of time, but also of resources.
@LadyLiberation_ Tbh I don‚Äôt care the reason for why they didn‚Äôt want to serve them. I still think that it‚Äôs shallow to deny someone service because they look or think differently to you. However it shows (once again) that both the left and right are hypocrites.

@HillaryClinton Shame on you Hillary Clinton. I would think that you, an experienced politician, would know what to do. However, your solution alone would not help us. Explain Palmdale to me. My friend lives near that school and he was worried sick about his friends. Gun Control doesn't work.

Tariq Nasheed Channel is Gone https://t.co/52A2LjyuDu via @YouTube
@RoamingMil Do all 4 topica
@LMDaniel2057 @DebunkOnDemand @Masasho81 @Mas_G_Radio It doesn't matter who the content is for. Everyone has to follow YouTube's Rules and Tariq did not by false flagging videos.
@RoamingMil Tariq's Channel terminated, Steve's Hypocrisy, and Bunty and Joy's channels taken down than reinstated
@gogreen18 I agree with 4 the last one though how dare you
RT @Barbara4u2: You're a joke @tariqnasheed. 	Stop crying same old washed up words when you're the only person responsible for your actions‚Ä¶
@tariqnasheed Ha wrong. Bunty's channel was deleted before, Joy's channel was deleted before, Avaliom (who I agree is a white supremacist) channel deleted
@tariqnasheed Actually that's not true
@Some_BlackGuy I mean @JoySparkleBS had her second channel terminated originally for no reason. Now it's fixed but @tariqnasheed she's white
@ChrisWarski @PeachBalie @Sugar_Tits_Bear I would die if that happened üòÇüòÇüòÇ Goodluck Peach #LeaveittoChrisWarski
@NameIsJosephine Oh wow I used to walking down the right side but I agree it's annoying when someone does it.
@KWintie @RoamingMil @TIME She has said she wants kids. She also says you wait until marriage. So Kristi what's your point
@brianstelter @ChrisCuomo He means like Project Varatas. CNN was exposed as irresponsible and reporting on news with little to no evidence
@thecjpearson One sided
@thecjpearson You can't just look at one side. He lost by less than 3 points in a state Trump won by 19 points. I didn't even support him but this is
@thecjpearson When you see the proportion of the vote he got in relation to Clinton's support that's impressive.
@PeachBalie @realDonaldTrump mind helping?

@Trenchy_666 What happened? Did you defend yourself or try to open up dialogue. That is being Hitler in Steves eyes
@WhatamI012 @JoySparkleBS @YT_Hero_QnA @LunaBlarp @Eobard_Thawne01 @truthseeker1978 @YouTube She deserves it because... she is not harassing anyone. But Do5 harassed their kids
@JoySparkleBS hey I need help for a project. I need to interview people on my subject which is commentary. Can you please help me Joy? üôèüèºüôèüèº
@TheNoBullshit @Barbara4u2 https://t.co/X4Ijw5eNRd IQ is a faulty way to look at this.
@bpennylane @newyorker2833 @thecjpearson I know I'm saying that Wallace supported segregation (Also Dixiecrats did support segregation as well)
@bpennylane @newyorker2833 @thecjpearson He was a segregation supporter for 3-4 elections and against it for 2 elections.
@Barbara4u2 Because it doesn't. Not only that but NOBS is spouting BS. IQ=\=Intellect
@bpennylane @newyorker2833 @thecjpearson I meant to say democrat my bad
@newyorker2833 @thecjpearson That was a typo I meant democrat.
@Sugar_Tits_Bear What's a super hat? Where can I get one? Will you buy it for me? Thanks Sugar and Bear #sugarbear
@Barbara4u2 Hey it says the stream begins at 2 am (is that a mistake)
@newyorker2833 @thecjpearson Except George Wallace was always a republican. Also Hillary supported Barry Goldwater what does that say about her?
@thecjpearson Also Storm Thurmond did switch political affiliation in September of 1964. George Wallace has always been a democrat.
@thecjpearson You know who supported the most Racist Republican candidate. Here's a hint her husband was impeached for lying to congress
@BeartrapSammich @RoamingMil A joke
@BeartrapSammich @RoamingMil No one is being serious it just a joke. Trust me 99.9% of people who use it to joke around. It's like the CNN video Trump tweeted out its
@gogreen18 @MsBlaireWhite @ContraPoints @MeghanEMurphy @RubinReport I can't wait. Even though we disagree on something's you are a huge inspiration for me. Thanks for opening up the conversation
@LadyThriller69 @JoySparkleBS @JoshPescatore Oh so Liberals can't be racist. I wouldn't bring up racism #Latinos4Joy
@marcorubio Agreed
@Some_BlackGuy @wizardofcause She doesn't even get the IQ =/= Intellect
@TaraMcCarthy_14 It's frustrating that you base this off of IQ instead of someone's true intellect

@ChrisCuomo It works in Europe. Why not join them and require photo ID to vote
@JoySparkleBS I wonder is Tariq and Onision are working together to silence those who oppose them.

@NateTalksToYou @Barbara4u2 @Some_BlackGuy @youngblackcon @RealKraut Wow
@NameIsJosephine She has no clue what she's talking about. IQ doesn't measure intelligence correctly.
@TaraMcCarthy_14 You realize that IQ can't prove how intelligent someone is right.
@RoamingMil I mean my friends use it as a joke. It's called trolling Margret
@MaeDfrog Depends on where you live. For me it's Verizon
@YouTube @TeamYouTube Please Fix this. Bunty and Jeff's videos don't violate your terms of service https://t.co/plkTC3Xtbx
Yep irony https://t.co/76eewVPsQ9
@BethuneSensei @NameIsJosephine @Tree_of_Logic @Some_BlackGuy @TaraMcCarthy_14 @RageAfterStorm People @RageAfterStorm The argument was terrible and you have no proof the IQ (which is proven to not measure someone's intellect) and crime
@BethuneSensei @NameIsJosephine @Tree_of_Logic @Some_BlackGuy @TaraMcCarthy_14 @RageAfterStorm I agree the video showed no connection in IQ and crime because it doesn't exist. Also that logic would be faulty taking account for biracial

@steve_shives You also attack people and don't have dialogue. You call us trash when in reality we are egalitarians. You use buzzwords to dismiss points
@PeachBalie @bear_ing How is @Onision a level 2 he fits the description of level 1.

@JoySparkleBS @JeffHollandaise @JaclynGlenn You know the theory of bullying. He is a worthless person and that's how he felt. He channels that to you to gain power. He's manipulatedyou
@JoySparkleBS @JeffHollandaise @JaclynGlenn I was on your side he was punting you because he is worthless. He wanted to channel the agression he has to losing subscribers. He's a bully
@JoySparkleBS @JeffHollandaise @JaclynGlenn You let him bully you into it. I know why you did it. You did the right thing but he threaten you into it. I'm glad you have the money
@JaclynGlenn @MsBlaireWhite @Onision I don't believe you were. Joy was bullied into it and she allowed it. I know why she did it was to shut him up, but he has no case on her
@JoySparkleBS @JeffHollandaise @JaclynGlenn I agree that you were punked I mean you let him bully you into a debate that you said you didn't want to do Joy. Jaclyn wasn't punked though
@JoySparkleBS Blaire White debating Onision thoughts?
@MsBlaireWhite @Onision Please drag him. He is such a liar and a hypocrite
@Onision @MsBlaireWhite Ha @Onision talking about honesty üòÇ You were discharged from the military under General honorable conditions which is a bad thing.
