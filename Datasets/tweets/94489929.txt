Thank you @RubioNM35!
Our culture, traditions, history &amp; heritage are tied directly to NM’s millions of acres of #publicland &amp; water, from jagged spires of the Organ Mountains to the hoodoos &amp; desert badlands of the northeast.

@nmcleanenergy I hereby restate that we HAVE read the newest version of the bills.
@nmcleanenergy There are two issues of ownership in #SB47. The bill allows PNM to own 100% of energy in the school district to replace 450MW. And it allows 75% ownership of overall nat gas and 50% of solar.
@nmcleanenergy Luckily, we have read the bill. But the newest version is not available to the public. Part of the problem.
The newest version of #SB47 is not available on https://t.co/AH2wBsNEm6.  https://t.co/HGSwP4YPM6 #nmleg
@nmcleanenergy Again, by your own definition that means that PNM would own 75% of nat gas + 50% solar = majority.
PNM ratepayers deserve their utility to have more oversight, irregardless of what applies to RETA. #nmleg #SB47
We support PNM being directed to build replacement energy in San Juan County to replace gross receipts taxes from the coal plant. But we do not support PNM owning the majority of that replacement energy. #nmleg
Opposition to #SB47 is not based on general hate for PNM. That diminishes the serious problems with the bills. #nmleg
Closing the coal plant is a serious issue and we need our legislators to address all of its widespread impacts on people’s livelihoods, power bills and the energy future of our state. SB47 doesn’t do this right. #nmleg

RT @BenJShelton: @nmcleanenergy @ProtectNM Savings compared to what? You have no idea what the PRC would give you for this. And how do you…
@SenCandelaria @nmcleanenergy Please enlighten us, Senator. It is our understanding that #SB47 includes 100% PNM ownership of replacement energy in San Juan school district. If that’s changed overnight, that’s part of the problem.
@nmcleanenergy Also customer savings are a GUESS bc this issue hasn’t been fully vetted by the PRC.
@nmcleanenergy We support economic development support for Farmington to be the most benefited, an amendment that was not in the original bill PNM proposed.
@nmcleanenergy Not demonizing anyone. We simply cannot support a bill that ONLY protects PNM shareholders. It is important to know that shareholders have made Billions of dollars of profit, while workers struggle and lose jobs.
We fully understand the gravity of the decision to close San Juan, and applaud speakers for elevating the plight of those who will lose jobs. But #SB47 does not fully reflect a commitment to supporting the 4 Corners economy or energy workers. #nmleg
We urge all stakeholders to take up #SB47 in a reasonable, thorough and fully open process outside of a rushed 30-day #nmleg session. Last minute, late night amendments do not result in a good deal for San Juan County, energy workers, ratepayers or clean energy transition

Laguna Pueblo speaks in opposition to #SB47. "We need to be at the table. We all need to be at the table when we discuss this issue." #nmleg
@nmcleanenergy In exchange for securitization, PNM wants to be allowed to own the majority of replacement renewable energy. That's not a good deal for ratepayers.
@nmcleanenergy But it removes some of the PRC's ability to determine if that is indeed the best deal for ratepayers. If PNM meets the requirements in this bill - rather than the requirements in law - the PRC must allow securitization.
.@PNMtalk is closing San Juan coal plant in 2022 bc they can't make $$ of it anymore. We have until 2022 to get a GOOD deal for San Juan County families, energy workers, ratepayers and NM's clean energy transition. #SB47 is not that deal. #nmleg
#SB47 continues to be a moving target. Just last night, more amendments were proposed. Some were improvements, some undermined the core intent of the measure. #nmleg
If #SB47 actually only allowed the PRC to utilize redevelopment bonds to reduce costs to ratepayers when San Juan coal plant closes, it would be supportable. #nmleg
Dine woman says that her community is not at the table in the discussions about closing San Juan coal plant and they will no longer stand for it. She urges SCONC to vote no on #SB47
Dine woman "probably the only indigenous person who is able to speak today" speaks in opposition to #SB47. "We will no longer stand to be the backed into a corner. We will no longer be economic costages." #nmleg
@nmcleanenergy @SenCandelaria #SB47 continues to propose that PNM be allowed to own the majority of any replacement energy once San Juan coal plant closes, which means ratepayers are not guaranteed the cleanest or most affordable energy.
@SenCandelaria With full respect Senator, as you stated 100s of hours went into negotiating on this bill and still we aren't able to support the measure. New amendments were proposed last night. We need a full process with full public input so that we put impacted communities first.
@sfhispanichambr And respectfully, @PNMtalk is closing San Juan coal plant because it can no longer turn a profit for them. No other reason.
@sfhispanichambr I'm glad we agree on those values. We were sure of it! Unfortunately, in #SB47 @PNMtalk falls short.
@SenCandelaria Of course. Respectfully, we're not even sure #SB47 guarantees closure of San Juan coal plant at this point, does not provide for an independent renewable energy economy, does not protect ratepayers enough. #nmleg
.@PNMtalk is closing San Juan coal plant solely because it can no longer financially benefit them. They are not closing it due to any regulation. #nmleg
RT @andrewboxford: These Twitter accounts backing SB47 seem like real advocacy groups and have some slick branding. But all of these accoun…
@SenCandelaria Yes, we came to the table to try to seize the full opportunity of closing San Juan. But PNM has continued to fall short on what they're willing to give to benefit ratepayers, energy workers and the rest of the state. We need a fuller discussion, will full public input. #nmleg
#SB47 process has been highly unusual for a bill of this magnitude. We’ve been concerned about the process of negotiating a sweeping deal that will have impacts on peoples livelihoods, power bills, and the energy future of our state behind closed doors. #nmleg
#SB47 started off as a bill about securitization, which is a financial tool that makes it easier for utilities to close aging coal plants early by allowing them to recover a percentage of what they expected to make during the life of the plant. #nmleg
By law, "stranded assets" lost by @PNMtalk need to be shared by ratepayers and shareholders. #SB47 puts 100% of the $353M they predict they'll lose by closing the coal plant early on the shoulders of ratepayers. #nmleg
It's @SenCandelaria, sponsor of the bill, who is speaking about #SB47 currently. https://t.co/9ORCjdzi4m
We agree with @SenCandelaria that proposals like #SB47 CAN support a transition to a clean energy economy. But it falls short. PNM insists on owning large portions of renewable replacement energy, which does not benefit ratepayers. #nmleg
PNM has stated that they will shut down San Juan coal plant in 2022, 30 years earlier than originally planned, because it can no longer turn a profit for them. And PNM's bill #SB47 serves their bottom line first and foremost. #nmleg

#CopperRule hearing at #NM Supreme Court is over. And now we wait. #WaterIsLife
NMED rebuttal - #CopperRule just codified what Freeport is already doing at its sites which is already contaminated
Once #CopperMine pollution is released into aquifers, mining companies will be relied upon to contain &amp; "pump &amp; treat" water for centuries
We're onto rebuttal @NewMexicoOAG's Tannis Fox starts by rebutting the claim that #CopperRule allows for site by site eval
Justice: If pollution is already escaping what do we do about that? Monitoring well detects a runaway problem right? NMED: yes. #CopperRule
All the stakeholders agreed on the draft rule until NMED subbed in Freeport's language! #CopperRule
"If NMED cares so much about pollution why didn't you define 'place of withdraw?'" #CopperRule #WaterIsLife
Overflow room giggles as NMED attorney says they take their job of protecting #water seriously. Eeeeeeekk! #CopperRule
(2/2) It was later learned through an IPRA request that NMED Statement of Reasons for #CopperRule was drafted by Freeport-McMoRan attorneys
(1/2) The #WQCC approved the Freeport-prepared draft #CopperRule along with the Proposed Statement of Reasons submitted by NMED
In 2012 at Freeport's request, NMED's upper management overruled a draft #CopperRule recommended by its own technical staff #WaterIsLife
"#Water is constitutionally protected in New Mexico and belongs to the public," Doug Meiklejohn @NMELC #waterislife #CopperRule
(2/2) with mining companies no longer required to prevent metals &amp; acids from leaking into &amp; contaminating groundwater #CopperRule
(1/2) Under #CopperRule copper mines are written off by regulators as "sacrifice zones" #waterislife
(2/2) and the #WQCC to adopt a regulation that protects groundwater quality from #CopperMine contamination #waterislife
(1/2) @NMELC @NewMexicoOAG @AmigosBravos1 Turner Ranch asking high court to set aside #CopperRule
Where are we getting our info? We go to the experts: https://t.co/yc3pQ3ksPP @NMELC #CopperRule #waterislife
#CopperRule was largely written by mining giant Freeport-McMoRan &amp; adopted in Oct 2013. Why are we letting industries write they own rules?
#CopperRule allows groundwater contamination how can we allow this when 9 out of 10 #NewMexicans depend on groundwater for drinking #water?
.@NewMexicoOAG's Tannis Fox "water of course flows" contamination under a mine doesn't stay there #CopperRule #waterislife
The #CopperRule is 1st reg since #NM's Water Quality Act in 1967 that allows an entire industry to intentionally pollute groundwater
#NM in drought, its irresponsible to allow mining co to pollute groundwater that is needed by all Allyson Siwik @GilaResources #CopperRule
Copper mines have operated quite successfully in #NM under the Water Quality Act for 40 years why need  #CopperRule now? #waterislife
.@NewMexicoOAG's Tannis Fox: Freeport Copper &amp; NMED experts themselves say #CopperRule allows contamination of 9 sq miles of groundwater
If not overturned the #CopperRule could set dangerous policy precedent for 100s of industry that may pollute groundwater in #NM #WaterIsLife
