We‚Äôre good at lying to redirect attention from bad things that happen, @realDonaldTrump   It doesn‚Äôt work when we make stuff up to pretend people actually like us. For that, we need to stick to hiring extras to pad our crowds. Let‚Äôs hire some French speakers! https://t.co/7PQTUpWBOb

@realDonaldTrump Not to mention running for president opened up some pretty great opportunities for new tv storylines and products. We would have been so much better off if we lost like we‚Äôd planned rather than dealing with all of this special prosecutor stuff. Right, @realDonaldTrump ??

Anyone else notice that @FoxNews seems less willing to defend everything I say without question?  I‚Äôm hearing a lot of ‚Äúwe will all know soon enough...‚Äù and a lot less about how everyone but me is a liar. Twitter fingers prepped for battle...I‚Äôve got to do everything myself! ü§¨

When I was elected president - by a huge majority I might add - I said to myself, ‚Äúthis must be the end of the world.‚Äù  Then I figured I‚Äôd try to make as much money out of it as possible. How often does a chance like this come along?  And what if I survive the #Apocalypse ?
@RandPaul You disagree here, but I see you‚Äôve reconstructed the story slightly to make @realDonaldTrump sound less crazy. Thanks, as always @RandPaul , for being a reliable member of the Trump Party. The ‚Äúlesser of two evils‚Äù sounds way better than ‚Äúenemy of freedom and democracy‚Äù üòò
