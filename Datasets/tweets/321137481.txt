Now mind you the one "good guy" was convicted of plowing his car into that crowd that killed an innocent woman.
@vichikin @btweet2all @CornellWBrooks @FairfaxJustin @AP @wolfblitzer @ErinBurnett @FWhitfield @JoyAnnReid @VictorBlackwell @jaketapper @maddow @smerconish @ChrisCuomo @FaceTheNation Trump made comments about a Mexican-American judge &amp; was criticized as racist. He also tweeted fake stats claiming that black Americans are responsible for the majority of murders of whites &amp; also in some speeches he linked African-Americans and Hispanics with violent crimes
@vichikin @btweet2all @CornellWBrooks @FairfaxJustin @AP @wolfblitzer @ErinBurnett @FWhitfield @JoyAnnReid @VictorBlackwell @jaketapper @maddow @smerconish @ChrisCuomo @FaceTheNation In a 2016 presidential campaign Trump said in a speech in which he stated that Mexican undocumented immigrants are criminals, rapists, or people who bring in drugs. He then stated "some, I assume, are good people."
@vichikin @btweet2all @CornellWBrooks @FairfaxJustin @AP @wolfblitzer @ErinBurnett @FWhitfield @JoyAnnReid @VictorBlackwell @jaketapper @maddow @smerconish @ChrisCuomo @FaceTheNation In 1973, Trump and his company were sued by the U.S. Department of Justice for housing discrimination against black renters—a lawsuit which, according to Trump, he settled without an admission of guilt. In 2011, Trump accused President Obama of not being born in the US
@vichikin @btweet2all @CornellWBrooks @FairfaxJustin @AP @wolfblitzer @ErinBurnett @FWhitfield @JoyAnnReid @VictorBlackwell @jaketapper @maddow @smerconish @ChrisCuomo @FaceTheNation He may not have no pictures but how about the way he describes a third world Country as a shithole Country!
