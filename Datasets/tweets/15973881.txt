@jriley8832 At a "news conference," there's an expectation that a pol will take questions. Would argue there's a distinction between that and a pol reading a statement and declining to take questions.
Trump is back in the United States, with Air Force One making a refueling stop in Alaska. The president is expected to make brief remarks there.
It's not a "news conference" if they don't take questions. It's a statement. That's true even if it's North Korea.
North Korean foreign minister Ri Yong-ho tells reporters in Vietnam that Kim will not alter the offer they made to Trump on nukes. ‚ÄúOur proposal will never change.‚Äù

Trump tells crowd in El Paso that he received accolades for his State of the Union address, but said that approach wouldn't work for a MAGA rally: "That‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre looking for."
So far, Trump's rally remarks in El Paso are substantially similar to those he delivered in the run up to the midterm (ie. this speech has not yet been retooled for 2020).
In his El Paso rally, Trump has so far blasted the media, mentioned North Korea, hit Beto O'Rourke and discussed a Rasmussen poll.		He has not discussed an emerging bipartisan agreement on government funding and border security.

@Serps Thanks, Evan. Sorry for the delay in getting back with you. I'll make mention of the protests when I write thru the story later today.
Asked if Baltimore is a sanctuary jurisdiction, Sessions says that city leaders have said it is. First, they have not said that. Second, I'm not a lawyer but that doesn't seem to be an answer that's grounded in the law.
.@kateamaraWBAL asks an excellent question: What does MS-13 have to do with Baltimore's homicide rate. "I don't know that the city itself has a high MS-13 murder rate."
Responding to a question about whether the FBI would take over the Suiter probe, Sessions said the FBI would "probably be able to act on it."

RT @KevinMaddenDC: Again, live debate audiences have to go.
"So, you can say it anyway you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women."
"I'm going to help the inner cities," Trump said. "She's done a terrible jobs for the African Americans."
"It's just words folks, it's just words."
Wait, was that a question?
"It's one of those things."
"I don't think you understand what was said."
Oh, no! He's sniffing.
No. Hand. Shake.

RT @PoliticoKevin: Mike Pence has basically treated this debate as a 2020 GOP primary debate.
Pence: "You whipped out that Mexican thing again." Kaine: "Can you defend it?"
No Spanish in this debate is kind of a bummer. I had the imperative form of "beber" queued up.
RT @StuPolitics: The Democrats are fortunate that VP debates are irrelevant.
Pence: "The focus has to be on criminal aliens." Not all that different from what Obama says. Much wiggle room in that  argument.
Kaine argues stop and frisk would be "a big mistake," calls for community policing. Baltimore has proven that transition is difficult.

@lost_tribe_7000 he didn't dedicate the book to Lucifer. But even if he had, not sure you can tie Clinton to Lucifer via a book dedication.
@jacktomalis @baltimoresun @mmfa the item doesn't say that alinsky dedicated the book.

@md_sbe Well, that's probably what it is then -- checks out. Thanks for response on this.
Representing Edwards in the legal effort to keep Baltimore polls open is Billy Murphy, longtime atty who also represents Freddie Gray fam.
"The plaintiffs are threatened with irreparable injury...since many voters will lose their right to vote," according to the complaint.
BREAKING: @DonnaFEdwards is asking a Baltimore Circuit Court to keep city precincts open until 10 p.m. because some opened late today.
@MattSheaff @MSNBC Thanks, sir. Hopefully I didn't say anything overly dumb.
Some context: It's very rare that there *aren't* a few precincts that open late in Baltimore. Usually, workers fail to show at a few.
What Edwards folks seem to be upset about is that Baltimore B.O.E. won't extend the hours.
.@DonnaFEdwards camp concerned abt a half dozen precincts that opened late in Baltimore today; filing a complaint "with a judge." More TK.
Update to last Tweet: Am told ballots going to unaffiliated in Wm Paca are all provisionals, so would be challenged if it ever came to it.
@md_sbe So camp. vols showed me pictures of receipts. Assume voters get a receipt for prov ballot, too?  In which case no big deal I guess.

Today is the first day of early voting in Maryland. Please do not call me about stolen yard signs. https://t.co/KBmPaqpdkf

Any day that I wake up and the White House has not given Politico a scoop in #mdsen is a good day, I guess.
RT @crwooters: Interesting perspective from @jonallendc on MD senate race. https://t.co/UJMRp3vTgH via @rollcall
RT @ppppolls: MD, like NY last week, is somewhere we don't poll much so now's the time if there's a q you'd like to see there: https://t.co‚Ä¶
@Beau1u @ppppolls look, the guy is a force in Md. politics, no doubt; but im not convinced he'd want it. he just passed on #mdsen. why gov?
Shorter John Kasich, who just wrapped up a town hall in Savage, Md.: GOP will come to its senses in Cleveland.
@ppppolls Delaney, Baker, Kamenentz.
Kasich, asked about violence in  Baltimore at a town in HoCo, says that in Ohio "we brought police and community together."
"We're going to get killed if we don't pick somebody who can win an election in the fall," @JohnKasich tells abt 400 ppl in Savage, Md.
Kasich is in this shot somewhere. Decent size crowd in Savage, Md. "Please join us at the adult table," he says. https://t.co/qP6NLvoXxU
RT @ABCPolitics: .@MartinOMalley on guitar, @GovMikeHuckabee on bass? It could happen, they tell @rickklein: https://t.co/CeXFbFtALf	https:‚Ä¶
RT @iduncan: Van Hollen calls superpac ad hitting him on campaign finance bill that had carve out for NRA "a new low in Maryland politics."‚Ä¶
I give up on Twitter &amp; myself. Atty Billy Murphy is backing Edwards in #mdsen (also supports Clinton, not Sanders). just #FF @cmcampbell6
@HenryJGomez Correct! That was my second tweet.
Will it matter? If Kasich wins a Md. CD, those delegates are bound to him for first two RNC ballots -- regardless of who they are supporting
Some GOP delegate trivia while we're waiting for Kasich in Savage, Md.: The gov is 9 delegates short of a full slate of 24 pledged in Md.
RT @HenryJGomez: Man, remember when Ehrlich was maybe gonna run for president? Fun times. https://t.co/5TzK1wOtjZ
Kasich campaign has the Maryland floor sign from the '08 convention here at his event in Savage. https://t.co/vMSPmxK0aC
Clinton notes B'More's Red Line again at Nat'l Action Network in NY: "They say transportation is a civil rights issue, and I agree."
Minn. Rep. @keithellison, a CBC member, on 2010 DISCLOSE vote: "For me, it was a pro-sunshine vote, not a pro-NRA vote." ¬†#mdsen
One last point on this NRA issue. White House is objecting to Obama's image in an ad; not weighing into Edwards' underlying argument. #mdsen
Van Hollen has scheduled a press conference in Baltimore this afternoon to respond to NRA ads. #mdsen
@anne7076 Okay, but everyone does that. Party leaders tend to steer clear of primaries within their own parties.
Wife of Rep. Cummings announces his endorsement for her to be a DNC delegate (but never mentions in press release that they're married).
Amid fight over super PAC ad, @DonnaFEdwards releases a new attack ad on the same issue: NRA.  https://t.co/vEsP5c1BOT #mdsen
RT @BethesdaBeat: Tom Perez was the special guest at the opening of a Clinton campaign office in Bethesda last night https://t.co/wbCVGxRbZP
Watch this latest #mdsen ad from @DonnaFEdwards, which camp unveiled today amid brouhaha over super PAC ad. #mdsen https://t.co/9SBhVqup7t
BTW, here is the #mdsen ad the WH objected to; the group has agreed to pull Obama from it, but stands by the rest. https://t.co/7FAKBy8Xmn
As White House and super PAC spar over anti-Van Hollen ad, @DonnaFEdwards camp is putting up a new spot on the same issue: NRA. #mdsen
Working for US spox says grp stands by facts in #mdsen ad, but "out of respect for..White House" will remove Obama. https://t.co/7FAKBxRmuP
At request of the White House, a super PAC will remove images of Obama from anti-Van Hollen attack ad. #mdsen https://t.co/7FAKBxRmuP
White House demands super PAC pull down its #mdsen ad: https://t.co/VgEORaNPg9  And here's our sty on the issue: https://t.co/DlRxvK1pdv
Clinton, Trump leading w/ likely Md. voters in NBC4/Marist Poll. Cruz in 2nd; different than recent Post-UMd. poll. https://t.co/PZ0EWG8im7
Latest on new #mdsen ads. https://t.co/Eb5miJeWm4
Eric Holder endorses @Glenn_Ivey in #md04. https://t.co/Yi4IRE5L2M
Fair point, @dcrussell. I meant three "leading," but there are six Democratic #md04 candidates.    https://t.co/KvFomhrvCX
.@WhipHoyer jumping into #mdsen race for the 1st time, calling on super PAC to take down an anti-Van Hollen ad. https://t.co/Z4Zg8uJClJ
Clinton campaign will begin airing its first ad in Maryland tomorrow ahead of 4/26 primary.  https://t.co/dofWc7S6Vp
New poll gives @VanHollenForMD a 6 point lead in #mdsen (44-38) https://t.co/HM5hwfpcoF
Hoyer, BTW, has not endorsed &amp; has been careful in characterizing #mdsen race; OTOH he's never had a great relationship with Edwards.
