@MikeOttonomous That being said, Gabbard has made her position more than clear on LGBT issues. This shouldn't even be an issue for her campaign. It's also good to have litmus tests, but make sure it's not used to eliminate a candidate before they get their message out.
@MikeOttonomous This is all too true. It's not even like she was late to the game for changing her stance. She changed her views in her 20's before she was even first sworn in. It's good to point out the bad things in a candidate, and no candidate is without fault.

31/ The best thing that we can do is hold our elected officials accountable for their votes on this issue and ensure that there is never another Supreme Court nominee who is as divisive and controversial as Brett Kavanaugh. #BrettKavanaugh #Kavanaugh #JusticeKavanaugh
30/ Judge Brett Kavanaugh is now Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the vote is over, and America is entering an era with a Supreme Court that is biased towards the right wing, with no clear moderate voice on the court.
29/ ‚Ä¶Brett Kavanaugh, over 650 law professors, his own alma mater, the largest church coalition in the US, his old friends, and former law clerks who all spoke out against Kavanaugh meant nothing to 49 Republican Senators and 1 Democratic Senator.
28/ Following her speech, former National Security Adviser Susan Rice expressed interest in the idea of running against Collins in 2020. In the end, there is nothing that can be done now. The brave women who came forward to share their stories about their experiences with‚Ä¶
27/ Of course, she voted ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù‚Äù thereby causing donations for her potential 2020 opponent to exceed $3,000,000 in under 24 hours and one individual has already expressed interest in running against Collins.
26/ Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) pulled something similar to Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) and delivered a near 45 minute speech prior to announcing how she would vote.
25/ Senator Flake, much like Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) will talk a big game when it comes to what Donald Trump is doing to the Republican Party and how the Republicans need to correct their course, but in the end, they both fall in line and vote to advance the GOP Agenda.
24/ Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Senator Bob Corker (R-TN) are both retiring at the end of their terms. They could have taken a principled stance on their way out to show that the Republican Party is more than the Party of Trump. Instead, they chose not to.
23/ There are plenty of Conservative individuals qualified for the court that don‚Äôt carry as much baggage as Brett Kavanaugh. Further, it wouldn‚Äôt even have to be Manchin and Murkowski who could have prevented this from occurring.
22/ His nomination would have been stopped there and the Trump Administration would have to put forth another name for someone to replace Justice Kennedy.
21/ ‚Ä¶her ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to a ‚ÄúNot Voting.‚Äù She did this purely to save her seat while maintaining the truth that she didn‚Äôt vote to confirm Kavanaugh. Had Manchin and Murkowski both voted ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Brett Kavanaugh would not have had the votes to reach the Supreme Court.
20/ ‚Ä¶initially vote ‚ÄúNo‚Äù on Kavanaugh, but following an extremely negative reaction from Alaska‚Äôs Right Wing yesterday, with former Governor and 2008 Republican VP Candidate Sarah Palin toying with the idea of a primary challenge in 2022, Murkowski folded and chose to change‚Ä¶
19/ With Manchin ahead of his opponent by a sizeable margin, a ‚ÄúNo‚Äù would have only helped to prevent Brett Kavanaugh from reaching the Supreme Court and would show principle, rather than a Senator playing politics. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) was the only Republican to‚Ä¶
18/ This isn‚Äôt even a certainty however, as West Virginia, for the most part, likes Joe Manchin. Plus, Senator Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), who is also up for reelection, is trailing behind her Republican opponent, but she still voted ‚ÄúNo‚Äù in the vote.
17/ Senator Manchin is up for reelection in this midterm election, and polling showed that had he voted ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù his reelection bid would be smashed and the Republican Party would pick up another Senate seat.
16/ Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) was the only Democratic Senator to vote ‚ÄúYes‚Äù on Brett Kavanaugh, and in his mind, he had a good reason.
15/ How did somebody with this sort of record (plus the allegations set forth by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Debora Ramirez) make it through the Senate to be confirmed in the most partisan Supreme Court nomination in history? Several key votes.
14/ This is quite the far cry to the checks and balances that were once a steadfast principle of our Democratic Republic. So how did it happen?
13/ By establishing this precedent, Justice Kavanaugh has set forth down a dangerous path that can lead to the Presidency being nearly unchecked in every aspect, with the President being able to claim executive privilege on anything they so choose to.
12/ ‚Ä¶to a subpoena sought by a subordinate executive branch official.‚Äù This subpoena, of course, is in reference to the ones sent out as part of the investigation into any potential violations of the law that the Nixon administration partook in.
11/ ‚Ä¶Presidency. In his commentary on U.S. v. Nixon, Kavanaugh said that, ‚ÄúNixon took away the power of the president to control information in the executive branch by holding that the courts had power and jurisdiction to order the president to disclose information in response‚Ä¶
10/ This isn‚Äôt good for you and I, as it results in politicians who are beholden to the highest bidder, leading to laws and decisions that aren‚Äôt supported by even 1/3 of Americans. Finally, and perhaps most frightening, is Kavanaugh‚Äôs thoughts on the power of the‚Ä¶
9/ Following the ruling of Citizens United v. FEC in 2010 that money = free speech, there is no reason to assume that Kavanaugh would change his position on the issue, thus causing the problem of money in politics to only grow.
8/ When commentating on the case, Kavanaugh said, ‚ÄúThe concept that government may restrict the speech of some elements of our society in order to enhance the relative voice of others is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.‚Äù
7/ ‚Ä¶Kavanaugh shows no signs of voting to limit the power of big money in politics, as shown by his commentary on the case of Buckley v. Valeo (limitations placed on election spending in the Federal Campaign Act of 1971 are unconstitutional).
6/ Any woman, no matter how young or old they may be, should have access to the health services they desire, no matter what. Despite the fact that she was here illegally, she was in US Custody, thereby leading her to be subject to the same rights as you and I. Next,‚Ä¶
5/ In a country that is supposed to be a bastion of freedom and where the issue of abortion has already been settled (Hello Roe V. Wade, how are you?) the fact that the right for a woman to choose is being systematically restricted is appalling.
4/ This decision was ultimately overruled, though Kavanaugh stood by his decision, saying that by reversing his decision, the court that overruled it created ‚Äúa new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand.‚Äù
3/ First, we need to look at the case of Azar v. Garcia, where Kavanaugh, then a judge for the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, ruled that an unaccompanied minor alien who was 8 weeks pregnant could not get an abortion.
2/ The outcome that we got (Judge Kavanaugh becoming Justice Kavanaugh) is not good for America, and here‚Äôs why.
1/ As most of you know, Brett Kavanaugh was officially confirmed to the Supreme Court today by a vote of 50-48 mostly along party lines, bringing an end to a bitter 3 months of deliberation, accusations, and investigations.

"THE DEATH TAX." Dude, the Estate Tax only applies to literally like .02% of America. Makes sense that Cruz wants to keep it, considering that they're the only people keeping him funded #TXSenateDebate

Another takeaway from this debate	- I can listen to Beto without wanting to rip out my eardrums	- Ted Cruz makes me wish I was deaf and blind 	#TXSenateDebate
Honestly this debate makes me despise Cruz even more #TXSenateDebate
CALL HIM OUT BETO #TXSenateDebate
Takeaway from the Amber Guyger bit	- Cruz can deliver a speech, play well to emotions, and lie through his teeth with confidence	- Beto can actually stick to facts and not play into emotions 	#TXSenateDebate
Happy to hear that Beto is open to abolishing ICE. We lasted without ICE from 1776-2003. We can manage without it. #TXSenateDebate

@chybbb I'm leaning on the first purely bc I don't wanna die, but I'm still undecided
@chybbb I'm either Majoring in PoliSci and Double Minoring in Economics and International Relations or Double Majoring in PoliSci and Economics and Minoring in International Relations

@MikeOttonomous Barely honestly. I've mainly been using it for Netflix and Halo so like, 5-6 hours a week at max. I've also had a string of bad luck with the One as a console. Great games, but the hardware just doesn't last. Including replacements and trade-ins, this is my 4th one

Lesson of the day, kiddos: Be an asshole, but be an asshole who is right. Also, patriarchal "men" ain't shit
@PatriarchyCtrl So I'm held to that same standard or you can't hold yourself to that standard. In the sense of debate, you have to keep things equal. I care because you're going after my friend. If feminists are so bad, block them, and block me first. I'd wear it proudly as a badge of honor

Funny...I thought sticking up for your friends was masculine https://t.co/oCvH52rVIl
@PatriarchyCtrl Yeah, your twitter history says otherwise, kiddo. If you weren't insecure about your masculinity, then you wouldn't care what a woman's views were. If you weren't harassing anyone, you wouldn't have a twitter account dedicated to leaving comments on random feminist's profiles

But to say that Kim Jong-Un, who has done nothing but lead North Korea further down a track of mad isolationism and poverty, is better than literally every POTUS is downright ignorant
Literally did you even read what I said? Things can be better in the US, that's obvious. The issue with Flint has been going on for far too long, the fact that the worlds richest country still has medical bankruptcies is shameful, our endless war machine needs to be stopped. https://t.co/BI0jy54i9n

@AWTH0M is implying that, without that extra boost, colleges won't be able to have diversity on their campuses, as those who the race factor applies to wouldn't otherwise be able to make it in.
@AWTH0M Will it move to a barcode type approach in the current administration? Based on prior actions involving race, it's highly unlikely. But still, the only thing that should ultimately matter is the academics and activities of the student. By adding the extra factor of race, the govt
@AWTH0M From a political context, that is true. As shown by his past actions, it's clearly another action of undoing something just bc he can and, you know, it being from Obama. Keep note as well that I'm speaking more in idealistic terms in regards to the application process.

@peterdaou @LitsaDremousis I don't need a Verrit code to understand that there are powerful women in politics Peter, but perhaps you need one to keep holding on to Neo-Liberalism
@peterdaou @LitsaDremousis the Left. Did you ever stop to consider why? It's not because "UGHH BERNIE BROS HATE HILLARY UGHHHH." It's because there are fundamental differences in our ideology. One side, the Progressive Side, just happens to be better on the issues than the other, the Neo-Liberals
@peterdaou @LitsaDremousis 2020, when I actually can vote, but in the mean time, I'm gonna be doing everything to shift the party away from Neo-Liberalism, as so many others are doing. It's a dying Ideology and we have to embrace the true Left to beat Trump. You say people who attack you come mainly from
@peterdaou @LitsaDremousis Do I wish there was a President Clinton over a President Trump? Of course, that's common sense. She was the better choice. But now the election is over and we have to look ahead. If you want Dems to win in the Midterms and in 2020, the party must swing left. I'll be voting Dem in
@peterdaou @LitsaDremousis and I'm all for it. But rather than blindly following the Neo-Liberal ideology, perhaps widen your viewpoint some and try to find a powerful woman who agrees with you, rather than continuing to defend someone who isn't running again.
@peterdaou @LitsaDremousis I look at your feed Peter, and it's good that you disagree with Clinton on Drones, Fracking, and Iraq! You have basic common sense!
