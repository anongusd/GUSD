@Bobbyboy01 @keithboykin @slpng_giants I hear you except this has been going on long before 45. 45 is a racist fear mongering sexist special kind of idiot to be sure, but this garbage pre-dates him.

@serverusautismo That's what I guessed, but I was astonished that in modern medicine there may be an option to terminate a pregnancy due to the chromosomal issues. Just stunned, so I didn't want to assume about ASD. :)
@serverusautismo My ignorance was very strong here! Thank you for sharing. I see having empowering ways to change self perception &amp; HF may point to strengths, and research is key! Is anyone really practicing eugenics for this? I've heard of ending pregnancy for Downs or Trisomy 18, but not ASD.

@SensoryWand @GilmanFamily @AutismTalkAspie I remember those days followed by hot baths &amp; naproxen. Middle's 14 now &amp; the baby is 10! Outside our house or some confined spaces, we have to call the mobile crisis unit for assistance and, depending on the meltdown, possibly 911 if danger is imminent. Stay strong self-care FTW
@GilmanFamily @AutismTalkAspie This could apply to other conditions w/similar events. Middle isn't quite diagnosable ASD, but qualifies all in for pediatric bipolar. IDK what may work for us adults (inclusive of other DX too). Comes down to symptoms as someone else said. Still pondering 3/3
@GilmanFamily @AutismTalkAspie *perhaps there could be a different kind of space still very close to the building &amp; specifically for BH/MH needs. This resolves the long parking hike &amp; means ‚ôø won't take the space you need; in my experience, there are frequently insufficient spaces to begin with. 2/3
@GilmanFamily @AutismTalkAspie I can support that for parents w/no hesitation. Before my injury I was strong if my middle kid melted down it was an ordeal to carry him 50' even w/another adult assisting. It was sometimes easier to get to the bathroom/changing room 1st depending upon the meltdown. Hmm 1/3
@Tabbatcat @amvetsupport I'd prefer term limits which I think will help remove corruption even among younger public servants. It'd be easy enough for Senate, House, just like President.

@AngelaF08695845 @RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump Me too! I believe the border agent who showed 45 how they built tunnels to cross in areas that already have walls. I also believe those agents who say the vast majority of bad stuff comes through the checkpoints. Walls do not equal border security.

@amvetsupport To be totally fair, he updated the one Obama installed &amp; both used their own money.	I don't love defending him given I've not cared for him since the 80s. The truth is extra important for those resisting; one false statement invalidates all statements as far as they're concerned.

@TheBipolarAspie Well done!! I'm proud of you!
@BipolarPanda87 Made a huge difference for my mom, especially re: PTSD, but a friend was overwhelmed re: their PTSD &amp; anxiety; it brought too much up at once to cope/process. My input- find a practitioner who excells w/pacing since it can bring stuff to the surface &amp; we process X amount @ once.
@BipolarPanda87 Depends on the day, but yeah. Other days I feel like people can accept me as I am, or GTFOH; I don't have time for that nonsense.

@mvanwie3 @BlueRobotDesign @mugzypayton @JanieVelencia @FiveThirtyEight @AOC My reply was soley to offer a different perspective to the false equivalency put out there. Had I chosen to reply to your questions, it would've been w/questions of my own; I haven't the data to offer an informed answer instead of assumptions because we don't know each other. :)
@mvanwie3 @BlueRobotDesign @mugzypayton @JanieVelencia @FiveThirtyEight @AOC You use 1 example of dividing a bill &amp; say we could figure out our fair shares. Then complain: somehow, w/taxes, nobody knows. I use alt example of dividing a bill &amp; specify my point-it's not always simple. Now you assert subject change &amp; what you think I want. You projecting or?
@David51654472 @mvanwie3 @BlueRobotDesign @mugzypayton @JanieVelencia @FiveThirtyEight @AOC No, I actually don't want that. As I stated previously my point was that one's fair share is not always straight forward. It wasn't a declaration of fair, rather pointing out that fair doesn't always = total cost / evenly by number of people.
@daveclinton51 @SenGillibrand Would that be the citizens forced off their land for a totally penetrable wall or the citizens lucky enough to live to the north of the land who get to look at an ugly wall. Maybe it's the citizens who don't want the ecological disaster that comes with the wall?

BTW I fully support border &amp; national security; I just don't agree the wall, which has proven to be penetrable multiple ways, is the best method. It's what I'd call throwing good money after bad. There are better ways.
This. So much this. 	See also: we've utterly failed to keep our promises to help our Veterans or expand funding for programs that do support them; however, some are super concerned about paying to fulfill some semblance of a promise for a wall that's proven to be penetrable. https://t.co/Qdmxga1NCj

@outsh1ned @drcarlpatrasso @JohnBrennan @MiaFarrow FWIW my intention was to address the previous tweet about fear mongering which I don't perceive Brennan doing, but can't seem to evade the others' efforts to do. It was not to wholely excuse or condone him or his other actions, many of which I'm certain we don't yet know. :)
@madmamma4 @drcarlpatrasso @JohnBrennan @MiaFarrow 1-The point is undermined as your tweet fails to be mature &amp; smart. Credit for correct spelling.	2-One needn't be leftist to dislike 45, merely awake, reasonable, &amp; moderately intelligent.	3-Since you assert liberals are mentally diseased, what's your excuse for supporters of 45?
@Bipolaronfire Funny thing about human beings is that most of us have some version of that thought. Funnier still is that in another 10 years, you'll likely have a similar thought about your appearance today. I think you're a gorgeous person &amp; have no clue what you look like :)

@Gimongous42 @SirJauregui @jossiel81 @Samynemir Thank you for the honest answer to the question I poorly asked. Perhaps the question I should have asked is how the migrant people you're referring to relate to the original post about Kevin Fret's murder.
@Gimongous42 @SirJauregui @jossiel81 @Samynemir Thank you for responding. I don't subscribe to the notion that other places are worse, so we can't point out ways we can be better. You are correct, there are authoritarian regimes that are MUCH worse, &amp; they don't claim the self-evident truth of mankind's equality, we do. :)
@EeveeCookies23 @AlwayzB_ @BrianJasonEvans @sahilkapur @AOC Perhaps there's been a misunderstanding with your friend. The USPS is self-funded &amp; therefore independent from the Fed gov't in regard to things like this. USPS employees are being paid.

@AaronDayAtlas @paulkrugman Totally! In the past they figured out they needn't send as much money to the gov't if they paid employess higher wages (middle class) or created charitable/philanthropic ventures (reducing gov't expense).

@D_Ruiz__ @diannaeanderson @kobando1 If you mean the poor ones, 70% of nothing is nothing.

@theSagist @sfreynolds @thedailybeast @Sil_Lai Typos do occur. The same spelling 2x isn't a typo, it's misspelling.

@JuddApatow I'll just leave this here https://t.co/dyXHSmsads	NSFW George Carlin
@macjama @Jillybgriff @JuddApatow How's he going to work a bit out if he can't handle feedback? He's free to say whatever he wants to &amp; joke about anything he wants to. In turn, the public is free to love it or hate it or anything between &amp; say so. If he can't take the feedback, he may want to keep off the stage.
@Bipolaronfire That's a lovely &amp; productive way to begin the new year! Well done!!
@JetPilotBishop @earthlingion @ChelseaClinton I don't condone the murder of Officer Singh; of course it's highly offensive! Officers put their lives on the line daily &amp; I pray they're safe.		That's logical false equivalency in this thread. Children didn't murder him. Yes, negligent homicide of children is a bit different.
@juliejoThecomic @ChelseaClinton @desminborges Basic step to prevent transmission of disease is quarantine the actively contagious rather than putting a child w/103 fever in w/other unvaccinated children. The issue isn't if ICE has superpowers, it's the inability to do basics, attempted positive spin &amp; racism in the attempt.
@themama9293 @Alt_FedEmployee Or treasury department
@ewadswor @RealMikeDoss @kristencompton @Alt_FedEmployee Or Duckworth or Tulsi
@AnastasiaBarzee @SassyKadiK I like Duckworth &amp; Tulsi also. Castro has some excellent experience &amp; Abrams has demonstrated perseverance. I'd have to take a closer look at any candidate's voting records on issues that matter to me though.
@SassyKadiK @HowardA_Esq What about Sen Duckworth?

Follow up questions- 	What is the cost you pay because you don't already do it?	What would it take or what would have to happen for you to do that now?
@KIRBSKEY Congratulations!! You're a very lucky family! #AdoptiveParent love &amp; hugs to you all :)
Interesting...I'd adjust the hypothetical to have duplicate worlds in which women &amp; men experience the world w/out the other. Non-binary folk can caucus w/group of choice, split time, or alternate idea. All know in 24hrs life reverts back.		What would or could you do that day? https://t.co/Pe9FxyVYBV

@Eurocentric @JohnBrennan He might want the footage, but the guy who illegally deployed troops to our border in time for Thanksgiving doesn't actually care about them being home for Christmas. He does seem to care about attention &amp; ratings though; I agree with you.
@Fox_Galewarden @Ocasio2018 Or never changed the default or used "password" smh
@EllenEnders @Ocasio2018 @alicegoldfuss Overall I agree, but we could just do away w/it. We don't need corporate involvement in primaries &amp; elections. The concept of a central committee to unify party platform seems outdated in current times. In addition, efficiency(or lack thereof) of committee decisions is legendary.
@FirefighterGeek @Ocasio2018 I agree with you. The latter reminds me of another theory that failed, but they said 'trickle'.
@aarbypls @onesien @Ocasio2018 Ian likely meant adjective; however, one could argue that being, in any of it's conjugated forms, is very powerful indeed.
@Ocasio2018 You know what they say; always put all your eggs in one basket. Especially if the eggs are valuable &amp; contain important privileged information! /s https://t.co/pns603zDMp
Thank you @ChrisMurphyCT, @SenBobCasey &amp; 54 other Senators voting with a conscience &amp; representing constituents like me!		41 Senators appear to be pro-authoritarian regime's genocidal targeting of starving civilians w/US weapons.

@adamha @Blarob @Ocasio2018 If we were to bar those who misspoke, who'd be left in gov't?	3rd grade civics is important; let's elevate standards for key officials including POTUS, Cabinet, &amp; UN Ambassador.	Can we agree 3rd grade spelling &amp; grammar are also important? How about 1st grade behavior &amp; manners?

@trumproud @PAHealthDept @GovernorTomWolf Who pays for the EMTs, Police, &amp; other first responders who also have naloxone? Who then pays the ER &amp; hospital bills? Which seems more cost efficient?
When nalaxone is distributed across families &amp; social networks, evidence finds a synergistic impact reducing deaths &amp; ER visits. Stats in PA alone-1/4 families struggle w/substance abuse prob &amp; PA in 2015 had approx 9 OD deaths/day-not including accidents or other related deaths. https://t.co/Cb5hDk0fT3
