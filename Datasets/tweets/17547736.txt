@donnalc @IOMcGehee The message, if anything, is that the 2018 midterms shows dark money is being embraced by operatives on both sides of the aisle, and Democrats and Republicans should both be interested in curbing unaccountable dark money

The committee has the ability to take on some very challenging issues on how the House works, says McGehee, rather than only “small ball” changes. It’s important it gets a lot of attention inside and outside of Congress because reforming Congress matters

@OpenSecretsDC @CookPolitical @Nick_Penniman An important point: "While raising the most money doesn’t necessarily guarantee victory on Election night, no candidate wants to be outspent by outside groups and lose control of the messaging in their own campaign," says @IOMcGehee
@OpenSecretsDC @CookPolitical @Nick_Penniman Our broken system "means that fewer people consider running for office, good leaders retire early, and those who continue serving frequently spend too much of their time raising money. This startling development should worry Democrats, Republicans, and independents alike."
@OpenSecretsDC @CookPolitical “When outside groups are spending more than	candidates are on their own campaigns, we’re in the	danger zone,” said Issue One CEO @Nick_Penniman .	“This is especially troubling because so much of this	money purchases negative TV ads."
@OpenSecretsDC @CookPolitical Non-candidate, non-party groups have now outspent candidates in 48 congressional races since the SCOTUS’ 2010 #CitizensUnited decision, with 1/3 of that total occurring in 2018. This phenomenon	occurred 11 times in 2016, and only once in 2010,	according to @OpenSecretsDC
@OpenSecretsDC The new data shows that candidates were outspent by outside groups in seven Senate races and nine House races. This amounted to more than half of the 13 competitive Senate contests and about 10 percent of the House races ranked as competitive by @CookPolitical
@OpenSecretsDC Why it matters: Control of the House and Senate for the next two years was determined by a small number of elections in 2018. Super PACs and dark money groups	focused most of their spending in these races

@clairecmc @RSI “I don’t know of a single member that is leaving that does not include the pressures of raising money to advance &amp; maintain your committee position as one of the contributing factors. They all talk about it. It wears you out," said ReFormers Caucus Co-chair @IOWamp in the report

@RSI @kevinrkosar @Nick_Penniman @Tim_Roemer "The fresh start of the 116th Congress presents leadership on Capitol Hill with the perfect opportunity to begin addressing these and other issues contributing to the broken political system in Washington," said Amb. Roemer
@RSI @kevinrkosar @Nick_Penniman “Members of Congress in both parties are sounding the alarm about dysfunction that hurts their ability to serve their constituents,” said Issue One ReFormers Caucus Co-chair @Tim_Roemer (D-IN).
@RSI @kevinrkosar “These departing Republicans and Democrats paint the disturbing picture that Congress is fast becoming a place that repels, rather than attracts, leaders who want to get things done,” said Issue One CEO @Nick_Penniman
@RSI “A healthy Congress is one where legislators feel like they are actually legislating for the public good,” said @RSI Vice President for Policy @kevinrkosar
@RSI Republican and Democratic members of Congress have proposed a variety of potential solutions, including the formation of a Joint Select Committee on the Organization of Congress. Read the full report and proposed solutions: https://t.co/4iy08x5VjJ
@RSI Partisanship is on the rise — and not going anywhere. Recently retired Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA), who served for 13 years, said, “[Members] political safety is tacking hard to their bases, and in many cases the fringe elements of the bases.”
@RSI Rep. Niki Tsongas (D-MA) also explained that “the seriousness of your candidacy is often measured by your ability to raise funds.”
@RSI Fundraising dues tied to committee assignments empowers the Speaker of the House. Rep. Jimmy Duncan (R-TN) said, “Listen, you don’t get these chairmanships,” if members do not pay their dues.
@RSI Republican term limits on Committee chairs hurts policy expertise and encourages retirements. Outgoing House Finance Committee Chair Jeb Hensarling (R-TX) noted, “Are term limits playing a role in an exodus of chairmen, along with collective years of wisdom? Of course it is.”
@RSI The congressional calendar is structured to fill campaign war chests. Much of today’s dysfunction dates back to the rise of House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA)in the 1990s, including the shortening of the official work week to provide members more time to dial for dollars
@RSI Limiting debate limits alliances between Republicans and Democrats. Rep. Rick Nolan (D-MN) noted that amendments offered helped members find common ground for cooperation. “That’s how members get to know each other and what their real feelings are about issues."
@RSI Party leaders continue to centralize power to the detriment of the committees. Rep. Mike Simpson (R-ID) said, “Leadership needs to give direction, but committee chairman aren’t what they used to be.”
@RSI Among the report’s key findings: Rank and file members feel left out of the debate. Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) once lamented, “Do I think I’m making a difference? No. Not from a legislative standpoint.”
@RSI Only once since 1930 has the number of voluntary departures been higher than it was this cycle. Members choosing to walk away from their public service positions include 8 GOP committee chairs and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) the 2nd speaker in a row to voluntarily leave
@RSI They range from hyper-partisanship in Congress and increased fundraising demands, to the growing centralization of power in party leaders, “closed rules” limiting legislative debate, and even the House calendar
@RSI Interviews with a select group of over half a dozen outgoing and recently-retired lawmakers who were vocal about why they chose not to return to Congress next year, as well as excerpts from interviews given by other retiring members, raised a number of critical issues

@IOMcGehee The committee must be bipartisan, preferably with leaders from both chambers. The committee should hold public hearings as well as private listening sessions with member offices and produce common sense proposals to ensure an updated, responsive, and representative institution
@IOMcGehee To tackle it problems head on, to treat the deep sickness of the body, the leaders in the 116th Congress should create a Joint Select Committee on the Capacity of Congress to bring both legislative chambers into the 21st century
@IOMcGehee Nothing empowers the Washington swamp more than high turnover, low pay, and a dysfunctional legislative branch
@IOMcGehee Congress should invest more in itself, including attracting and retaining talented staff, allocating greater resources to member offices and committees, and prioritizing subject matter expertise in the halls on Capitol Hill.

The Center for Public Integrity’s investigation identified more than 5,900 Senate records since 2016 with inaccuracies — totaling more than $70 million — “traceable to the government’s conversion of paper [campaign finance reports] into electronic data.”
According to a recent investigation by @Publici, digital records associated with Senate campaign finance reports were ten times more likely to contain errors than records associated with the electronically filed records of House campaign finance reports https://t.co/KgcQLQsP9i
The change is also expected to increase the accuracy of the records maintained by the FEC.
The switch to e-filing will save taxpayers just under $900,000 a year, according to the Federal Election Commission.

For 14 of the 15 #darkmoney groups, more than half of the spending they reported to the FEC on ads overtly calling for the election or defeat of candidates was negative, showcasing the role these organizations have as attack dogs that frequently malign candidates from the shadows
In a handful of cases, Issue One identified the donors behind more than half of the money the groups had raised; but for some groups, as little as two percent of their funding was able to be linked to donors or donor organizations
