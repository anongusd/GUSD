7. This is a long-winded way of saying that if you want to support someone, pre-order their book. It can have a big impact on the success of their book launch. Pre-ordering is particularly important if the author is a woman, a POC, and/or LGBTQ! 		Now, please go pre-order a book!
6. And there are other metrics, like getting a book into the Amazon top 100 when its still in pre-order phase. Again, publishers and booksellers take note of that achievement and I know TV bookers/producers that pay close attention to the Amazon top 100.
5. A book that gets a lot of pre-orders builds buzz. The publisher and booksellers notice. Booksellers are willing to feature the book more prominently. The publisher will put more resources into promoting the book. All of this, obviously, helps the author you want to support!
4. Let's say an author's book goes up for pre-order seven months before launch date. That gives the author seven months to build up enough sales to qualify for a bestsellers list. And here's another reason why pre-orders are important and can lead to success
3. Landing on the bestseller list (especially for a first time author) can be a game changer. More book deals, speaking opportunities, and increased media visibility can offer stability to an author who is used to living paycheck-to-paycheck.
2. First, with respect to bestseller lists (NYT bestseller list being the most important) all the pre-order sales are counted as part of the first weeks sales. Getting on the bestseller lists launch week brings more attention and increased sales to books.
1. Important! If you want to support an author, please do not wait for their book release day/week/month to buy their book. In publishing, pre-orders are critical! Pre-orders can make or break a book, so if you want to show your support here's why you should pre-order..(cont)

12. Finally, watch this clip to get a sense of what Solemani's rhetoric is like. This is very telling: he says that it is beneath the dignity of Iran's president to respond to Trump's attacks on Twitter...that Solemani, as a soldier, will respond. https://t.co/OY7M7j559t
11. And there's nothing that delights Soleimani more than stirring up trouble on behalf of the Islamic Republic around the world. He is been waiting to be truly unleashed. 		(cont) https://t.co/tRB66fFUl2
10. With Iran veering further into hardliner isolationism the concern doesn't need to be nuclear weapons (that has always been a distraction). The concern should be more proxy wars, more Iranian intervention throughout the Middle-East, more terrorism, more cyber attacks.
9. This is a reminder, no matter how bombastic, to pay attention to what the Supreme Leader says. Here he is a few weeks ago in an "I told you so moment" saying he warned Zarif not to trust the US and that Zarif now realizes that Khamenei was right. https://t.co/Fsej4BfWRR
8. Syria is Iran's closest ally. Soleimani spends a lot of time there and he exerts a lot of power there. But the image of the Pres (not the Supreme Leader!) meeting with Al-Assad in a meeting w/o foreign minister who was in Iran shows Iran is veering further into an isolation
7. That text-message is an extraordinary (yet unsurprising) display of power. Especially since Iran has an elected president and foreign minister. But it illustrates how much real power the hardliners have in Iran. Now, back to Soleimani in that meeting with Al-Assad
6. In countries like Argentina, the United States, India, and Germany. If you want to understand how powerful Soleimani is all you have to look to is a text-message he sent to David Petraeus in 2008. 		https://t.co/3QdthfC01P https://t.co/lTQPOQNqRW
5. Qods force &amp; its proxies are responsible for assignations, terrorism, and unconventional warfare that Iran supporters in countries like Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen. They are also responsible for successful and attempted terrorist acts and assassinations in countries (cont)
4. Soleimani reports directly to the Supreme Leader, the Qods force is technically part of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps which also reports to the Supreme Leader. Soleimani is arguably the second most powerful man in Iran just after the Supreme Leader
3. What is surprising is that Javad Zarif, Foreign Minister of Iran who just resigned, wasn't present and reportedly wasn't told Al-Assad would be meeting with Iranian leaders. The fact that only Soleimani was present speaks to how much control hardliners are exerting right now
2. His name is Qasem Soleimani and he's sitting where the Foreign Minister should be sitting. Who is Soleimani? He is the head of Quds Force, Iran's powerful and shadowy external security agency. It's not a surprise that Soleimani was present (I'll get to that later)
1. This photo tells you everything you need to know about Iran right now. Iran's Supreme Leader and Iran's President met with Bashar Al-Assad yesterday. In this photo you have President Rouhani, Al-Assad, and a translator. Who is the man on the left? 		(cont) https://t.co/7CdJeytCK6

34. But we need you to understand that we often know how best to work with it, you don't. We need you, if you value our work and value us as friends, spouses, to learn from us what our challenges are. We have so much to offer you if you give us a chance.
33. It's because people who don't have ADHD think it's great to pop an adderall before going out. Notice how I am not talking about people who are facing addiction. What we need you to understand is ADHD is our daily/hourly burden. It is a complex disorder that we can work with
32. That's what doctors are for. We also don't need those of you who take adderall recreationally or once in a while to study an examine to mess up the system for us. Several years ago I had to go to 3 pharmacies to find adderall. That's not because people with ADHD abuse it
31. We don't need you to tell us that we must have lost weight cause we take medication, or if we are particularly productive one day, we don't need you to say things like we should take more medication. We don't you telling us that we should take less medication either
30. Speaking of keys, you know what changed everything for me? When I started taking medication (in my case, adderall) eight years ago. It changed my life in a way I can't explain in a tweet. What those of us with ADHD don't need from you is jokes about medication.
29. We need you to understand that we don't intend to upset you with what seem like failures to you. We don't mean to let you down. When you have ADHD it's like seeing what you want in a glass case you don't have access to. We want to accomplish so much, we just need the keys
28. We usually don't work with tough love, we work well with support. One of the kindest things a friend ever did for me is when I had a project to finish, she stayed in the room with me quietly working because she knew that I would feel motivated to get it done if she was there
27. That's why it's painful when people say they understand ADHD because a family member has it or they once dated someone with ADHD. It's why it's painful when people say things like "oh I'm so ADHD today." I often say to those people, "Really? Because I'm ADHD every day.."
26. The best way I heard ADHD symptoms described was "a Venn diagram with many circles." But it all boils down to this: we have things that challenge us, things that may seem simple/silly to you, but they're things that can quite  take over and destroy our lives if not addressed.
25. That there was a good chance I wouldn't be able to get back to my work. People would get annoyed and think I was being difficult. That's the reason I'm talking about ADHD now, I hope people on both sides of ADHD can be more mindful of what works and doesn't work. (cont)
24. In the past (before I learned what systems I needed in place) I would see an email come in from a friend or colleague asking to chat. I would tell them I was focused on work and they would often say "it'll just take a minute!" They didn't get if I gave them that minute
23. One of the challenges for me is in order to focus on something like writing, unless I have the adrenaline that comes with not wanting to get scooped, I have to really shut out everything. But people don't understand that I can't do a back and forth when I'm in that zone.
22. Last year I was meeting with a company that wanted to hire me and I told them I have ADHD and would find it challenging to work in an open office environment..the people I was speaking to understood that and were happy to accommodate it. But it hasn't always been easy
21. And that would then bleed into my work, etc. I have had mixed success explaining my triggers to people. Some think I'm making excuses or they just don't understand why a simple thing like hanging a towel is a challenge. But I'm not going to stop explaining it
20. What I have learned about ADHD is that it can ravage ones life if you let little things slip. I knew if I kept dropping the towel on the floor, I wouldn't make my bed, I wouldn't put my clothes away. Then, that would lead me to get depressed with the state of my home
19. My towel would often end up on the floor and I didn't want to live that way anymore. So I realized that if I just put a basket in my bathroom I could toss towels in there. Is it crazy to use a towel once and wash it? No doubt...but the alternative wasn't very attractive
18. Want to know why I have so many towels? Yes, I can be bougie...I'll admit it. But its because it allows me to keep my bathroom organized. I found that it was very hard for me, especially when I have a lot of things going on in my life, to lay my towel over the bar.
17. At home ADHD can have a big impact on relationships, we have a hard time staying organized and tidy. This can have an impact on relationships. I have taught myself many tricks over the years but many people with ADHD aren't taught to be mindful of their ADHD.
16. As child, they're less likely to be diagnosed as an adult. Many people see ADHD (because of the hyperactivity component...which not all people with ADHD have) as a boy/man's disorder...which leads many women to not be diagnosed.
15. On people being successful at work and even getting a job. Some people think ADHD is over diagnosed...I don't know if it is or isn't, but I can tell you if it is, it's over diagnosed in kids. It's under diagnosed among adults. We know that if someone isn't diagnosed
14. Now, I realize that being able to talk about it is a privilege. People rightly fear that they could be seen differently at work or may not get assignments they deserve. This is a step-by-step process that will take a while...but it's so important because ADHD has an impact
13. As egotistical as this may sound, I really hope to change that. I've been thinking about talking about ADHD for a few months and finally acknowledged how misunderstood it is among adults. Because we don't talk about it, ADHD has a big impact at work and home.
12. Because of this shame, we don't talk about ADHD generally. We may talk about it with close family members or a psychiatrist but we don't talk about it with our friends &amp; certainly don't talk about it at work (I know this is a generalization and may not be true for you)
11. To get out of, it destroyed their credit, and it was only when they got married and their wife took over that they fixed their bill paying issue. People with ADHD hide a lot of shame in this and we hold it in because people don't understand our diagnosis.
10. Which is often why we hide these things that we find challenging because they can be embarrassing. I once had someone with ADHD, who made a good living, tell me that for years they would pay bills when things got shut off. It was a cycle they found nearly impossible
9. For people with ADHD the issue is often the difficulty starting things. It is enormously challenging for us in certain categories. The simplest things can be exhausting and feel impossible to begin/finish. It's stuff that doesn't make sense to people without ADHD.
8. For example, people will often say that people with ADHD tend to procrastinate. That is a total misunderstanding of what ADHD is about. Procrastination has a connotation of intentionally putting something off for various reasons. We don't want to be this way.
7. Those of us with ADHD don't need your sympathy, we need your empathy. We need you to understand that we are capable of so much but just need you to understand what our limits and challenges are. We don't want you to see our limits/challenges as excuses...they're explanations
6. Whenever someone brings up ADHD. It makes it seem like it's is just an issue of distraction. Wrong! For example, I read 2-3 books a week! I don't know many people with ADHD can do that. But for me taking clothes out of the dryer &amp; folding them, that's like climbing Mt. Everest
5. People who don't have ADHD often oversimplify what it means to have ADHD. I don't blame them, they're not living with ADHD. But that's one of the reasons ADHD is so misunderstood because it's anything but simple. That's why it's so hurtful when people jokingly say "squirrel"
4. I want to be clear, I don't speak for everyone with ADHD but I have spoken to enough people over the last two years with ADHD that I feel comfortable speaking about it publicly.
3. When people have asked me in the past to describe what ADHD feels like I get into details about how it impacts my life every day but I always add that for me that ADHD has caused me a great deal of emotional pain. It's a frustrating, infuriating disorder.
2. Because many people think those with ADHD all have similar symptoms and challenges, we don't often get the empathy and support we need. ADHD is something we live with every day, hour, minute. It can ravage our lives and you may not even be aware of it.
1. I want to talk about ADHD. I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 13-years-old. To say it's misunderstood (both by people who have ADHD and people who don't have it) is an understatement. What people need to understand about those of us who have ADHD is we are not homogeneous

RT @funkybrownchick: Oh? Thread. https://t.co/znxTUdPfNV
RT @anibundel: Thread https://t.co/TOGWSGgPXC
11. The Donna Gigliotti's of the world knew for decades what Weinstein was about and did nothing. What are the consequences for that kind of behavior? If you're a Weinstein survivor you look at this situation and say: the consequences are you get to produce the #Oscars
10. All of the women I spoke to have not seen their careers recover after the monster who destroyed their lives was finally exposed. They wondered, what they have to do to be put in a position of power like Gigliotti as they look at mounting bills and dried up job offers?
9. All the Weinstein stuff has been swept under the red carpet and people have moved on. Except all the women who had their careers and lives destroyed by Harvey continue to suffer.
8. Here's why I'm bringing this up, there still hasn't been a full accounting of what Weinstein did and there hasn't been any real justice for the women who had to deal with this monster for so many years. If you think the entertainment business has changed, you're wrong
7. Donna Gigliotti acknowledged to the Times that Zelda Perkins told her about Weinstein's predation. She then says she didn't speak to Weinstein for years after the #Oscars 		Yet, she went back to work with him as President of his company in 2010? 		https://t.co/NQK3mkzoZw https://t.co/IAUQljdPWJ
6. Remember, Donna Gigliotti wasn't an assistant or a lowly executive, she was about to win an Oscar for best picture but as Zelda Perkins explains it, she couldn't be bothered after recommending a lawyer and she certainly wasn't going to call out Weinstein's predation.
5. That's why Weinstein survivors were horrified to learn that she is producing the Oscars this year. In 1998, Gigliotti was told about Weinstein's behavior explicitly by Zelda Perkins. This is from an investigation by @jodikantor @susandominus @mega2e 		https://t.co/NQK3mkzoZw https://t.co/Tdr2QSPDN3
4. After Weinstein's history of predation was revealed in several investigations, there were a lot of questions about who knew what and when. People who didn't know anything were unfairly blamed but Donna Gigliotti knew about Harvey's predation and knew a lot.
3. Background: Donna Gigliotti was an executive at Miramax for many years before she left and produced Shakespeare in Love with Weinstein and that year they won the Oscar for Best Picture but that's not why she's part of the Weinstein complicity machine. https://t.co/2q9yzwE5Ly
2. As many of you know, I have written a bunch of stories about Weinstein over the past 16 months. I've gotten to know over two dozen Weinstein survivors through my reporting. When I told 8 of them that Gigliotti was producing the #Oscars they were horrified and upset
1. Lots of controversy around the #Oscars this year but I'm surprised no one has brought up that someone many people see as part of Harvey Weinstein's complicity machine is being called out. The co-producer of the Oscars this year, Donna Gigliotti

@ChrisStigall Anyway I know you're probably rolling your eyes right now. Have a good night.
@ChrisStigall As a guy who grew up in the midwest I'm not blind to what your'e talking about but I'm just sensitive to tying the two together. It implies flyover country isn't tolerant. Isn't that what conservatives have been trying to change? The idea that flyover country is close minded?
2. And to all the folks saying Billy Porter is just looking for attention...um yeah. He's on the #Oscars red carpet. He didn't show up to his grocery store in that dress.
@ChrisStigall oh Chris don't be ridiculous! Seriously - you're smarter than that. You didn't say it was ridiculous - you tied it into flyover country. If you just said it was ridiculous I wouldn't have responded. Come on
@ChrisStigall But why Chris? It‚Äôs what he wants to wear. I‚Äôm asking earnestly
I wish I had a Billy Porter when I was a kid. You don't need to want to wear a dress to be inspired by someone who is unafraid to be themselves. https://t.co/KEfNxf6viK

3. They think their friends will abandon them or be angry with them because they've been lying to them for years. But that doesn't happen...I've never known it to happen. I had a friend come out at age 60 a few years ago! Everyone in my friends life embraced them! (cont)
2. For various reasons someone won't come out between 16-25 and then it gets more difficult as they grow older to come out. They have gay friends, everyone around them is accepting, but they don't come out because they think they're too old and that it's too late. (cont)
1. I have friends that are shocked when I tell them there are lots of closeted men in big, mainly progressive cities like LA and NYC. There are many reasons people stay closeted but one that isn't talked about enough is what I call "too late to come out" syndrome. (cont)

15. There's nothing wrong with people in politics transitioning to reporting. But we must prove to the public that we are earnest, we must earn their trust, and we have to prove we're in it for the right reasons. Without transparency, why should the public trust Sarah?
14. The question I have is what is the obsession with elevating her right away. Even after public outcry, why not have her be just an analyst and work her way to reported pieces. There are so many talented editors out there, why does this have to happen now?
13. Sarah will be stepping into this role, where she comes from an office that was at the center of so many controversies in the administration, and she gets to learn about many peoples sources. She gets that privilege without proving to the public that she is to be trusted
12. So when I write a story I only know about my sources. I only know about sources I have worked hard to get and bring to the table. Same for other reporters people have brought up like Jim Sciutto. Jim doesn't know who Jake Tappers sources are. You eat what you kill.
11. A key concern I have is she will find out about sourcing. This is and should be nerve wracking for many folks. When reporters write a story and have sources on background/OTR. There are only two people who learn about those sources: their editor and occasionally a lawyer
10. Sarah is transitioning from a highly contentious and controversial office/administration. You can't just put someone like that in a managerial role. I wouldn't have dreamed of becoming a California politics editor for example.
9. But she's going straight in as a boss. I couldn't have imagined doing that when I started. Also this isn't a one size fits all situation here. You can't just have everyone who previously worked in politics go through the same process.
8. For example, using the example of George Stephanopolous, he started out as an analyst at ABC and then transitioned over to anchoring, moderating etc. If she had joined CNN as an analyst and then started doing reported pieces after a while that would make sense.
7. Fewer people would be complaining about the issue of experience if she weren't in a managerial role. But she's going to a position that truly requires some experience. And Sarah hasn't gone through the process of proving herself to skeptics. It's an important process!
6. Why is this important? Because some folks get concerned about political agendas, they wonder if you're using the powerful position of a reporter because you have an axe to grind. Some have said that people who complain she has no experience as a journalist are being elitist
5. While Sarah will occasionally appear on camera, most of her work will be behind the scenes. How will the public ever know what she's doing? Sure if you know her you can say you trust her, but its important that everyone have the opportunity to examine her work.
4. That's why when people, including close friends of mine, bring up examples like Chuck Todd, Jake Tapper, Tim Russert, Jim Sciutto, and George Stephanopoulos, I get frustrated because all of these people are on camera or have their bylines on stories.
3. If I tweeted something that was unfair/biased (I know some don't like that concept anymore), or I wrote a story that was unfair, the public finds out about it and can hold me accountable. That can't happen with the job Sarah has been hired for..
2. When I transitioned from politics to reporting I knew I had a lot to prove. Anyone who makes that transition does and that's a good thing. Key difference is everyone can see the work I'm doing, whether its on Twitter or in published stories, I can be held accountable.
1. I have something to say about this. I might say some stuff others have said but I have a unique perspective. I transitioned from politics to reporting. The position Sarah's been hired for lacks a very important element: transparency. That's what should concern people. 		(cont) https://t.co/r1h2vVRGuV
