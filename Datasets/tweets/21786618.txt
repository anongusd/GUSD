@WhiskersCrowley @SerenityFoods one way to say it might be to say, 'if they're the nominee, i'll vote for them--but it troubles me they're still doing x, or y. I'll work to make that change over their 4 years.'
@documentfables i often use 'climate chaos.' (alliteration!). but it is very hard to actually change words in the language--they resist!
@pyroprince222 that is not my aim.
@Supamanhiphop This is very true!
@zz2aa @Cat_tankerous definitely a fine line. somehow tone matters!
@TimothyColman @Jawbonefnass nice!
@dovesandletters @anphonyboloney so, that's one way to look at. how i look at it is, we build movements instead of depending on particular people. if they're big enough, those movements change the zeitgeist. but, they do require a pres to sign something someday. A good thing about Bernie is, he builds movements.
@ISeeYouMotel6 i don't think that's what i was saying, but i may not have expressed myself clearly. will keep trying
@Jawbonefnass maybe. but perhaps there's a way short of  'calls bullshit' that could get the sorting job done.
@Cat_tankerous actually, the party seems to me to be moving in the right direction--min wage, M4A, etc.  	but without the WH it won't do much good
So here goes.  @amyklobuchar worked creatively with the trucking industry to try and stop human trafficking--much of which relies on trucks. That seems wise. https://t.co/NSykNVJP5C	#DemUnityTwitterProject
This isn't my main obsession, obviously--most of my twitter feed will remain about climate change. And I'm a little reluctant to try it, for fear it will call out every troll in existence. Also, 20-month campaigns are too long. Still, we should remember the stakes.
I hope others might decide to join in, or figure out some other better way of doing this (maybe others already have). Remember, praising someone for something doesn't mean you'll vote for them in a primary, or can't find things to object to. It means: here's a good thing.
And it doesn't mean one shouldn't criticize presidential candidates or hold them accountable--only that you should do recognizing full well that you might need to vote and campaign for them in the end.
It doesn't mean I'm necessarily voting for that person. Indeed, I'm an aging balding Vermonter who thinks we need to turn the world upside down to deal with climate change, so you can maybe guess my inclination.
So it seems to me useful for each of us to try and modulate the tone a bit. Here's what I'm going to do: find something each day that I like about one of the candidates and post it on this thread, with the hashtag #DemUnityTwitterProject
And if a second Trump term happens, then literally none of the things we care about--federal minimum wage, health care for all, climate laws, immigration reform etc etc etc--can possibly happen. Also, we'll all lose our minds.
The toxicity that defines so much of Twitter--whether it comes from bots or real but entirely unrestrained people--may lead to such bitter feelings and such deep divides that Trump, despite his unpopularity, wins again. https://t.co/eLnWRYZSTx
Thread here. I'm beginning to worry about the 2020 election. There are so many Dems, and so much passion, that it seems to me great damage could be done unless real care is taken. Some of that is on the candidates, but some of it is on us, and I have a small idea that might help.

Oh, and @Middlebury also said it would cut energy use 25% in a decade, and supply all of it with renewables. (Micro-hydro!) The school with the first-ever enviro studies program (and the birthplace of @350) is now back among the very greenest institutions in the world. 5/6
As a result, even places with deep Wall St. ties are re-examining their thinking--NYC and London pension funds for instance, which are the two biggest financial capitals on earth, have recently divested 4/6
The climate crisis deepened; renewable energy plummeted in price; it became clear that fossil fuel was a lousy investment; and it was revealed that the oil companies had lied through their teeth (which matters at academic institutions). 3/6
Such credit to the students of #divestmidd who have never stopped pushing, and to college president @LaurieLPatton and to the board of trustees. But also pay attention to what's changed since Middlebury first said no six years ago 2/6
Big beautiful breaking news--@Middlebury has just announced it is divesting from fossil fuel. This is great news because it's a billion dollars--but also because it's one of the first institutions to reject divestment and then change its mind 1/6

But now each of these dozens of agencies will have to go through the process. Given New York's byzantine politics, it will doubtless take a while, but the activists who have been pushing for this, and the governor's staff, deserve real credit.#divestny #fossilfreeny 5/5
A few, like the state's excellent Energy Research and Devt. Authority @nyserda, have already done this task, reducing their fossil fuel portfolio from 7% to almost nothing (and seeing returns rise) 4/5
This is not as big as the $200 billion state pension fund under the intractable state comptroller's grip, but it's not small either: in total, about $40 billion 3/5
But today governor Cuomo announced that a separate group of entities--"authorities" like the Transit Authority and the State Insurance Fund--will have to "commence a process to review and evaluate the feasibility and appropriateness of divesting from fossil fuels." 2/5
So, this is a little complicated but I think really important. As those who have been following closely know, NYState (as opposed to NYCity) has refused to divest its main pension fund from fossil fuels because its powerful comptroller won't stand up to the oil companies 1/5

@loudlong @SenJeffMerkley there's nothing contradictory about them; this is a big enough problem that many solutions are required
In the past couple of years, @SenJeffMerkley has introduced legislation to keep fossil fuels in the ground, he's pulled his support for new gas pipelines in Oregon, and now he's trying to make sure America emulates Ireland by divesting. I think he gets the climate challenge https://t.co/UB34qSbwG4
Okay, this is a really big deal. @SenJeffMerkley  just introduced legislation that would start the federal pension system on the path to fossil fuel divestment. The #RiseAct is a tribute to the millions who've already fought for divestment	https://t.co/7fHCyjXohz

Hey, @CynthiaNixon is going to do a virtual town hall about climate change in about an hour. I get to join her for a little while, which I'm much looking forward to. Join in!	https://t.co/YFT4kdk4fp
@RoyScranton @Revkin @KHayhoe @ClimateOfGavin @vaarloek @do_you_cli_fi_ @EricHolthaus @dwallacewells @NathanielRich 350 is where we should be.  410 is where we are. 700 is where we're headed if we don't fight. So, fight. This seems straightforward to me.
@MaibachEd @GeoffreySupran @NaomiOreskes @KHayhoe @rahmstorf @MichaelEMann @EricHolthaus @dan_kammen @dana1981 @Agent350 @Mason4C @docsforclimate @ClimateMuseum @republicEn Thats for sure!
@RoyScranton @Revkin @KHayhoe @ClimateOfGavin @vaarloek @do_you_cli_fi_ @EricHolthaus @dwallacewells @NathanielRich Sure. And a key part of adaptation is limiting the damage. Adapt to that you can't prevent, prevent that to which you can't adapt. That's what we fight for. A 2 degree world is not a 3 deg world is not a 4 deg world. So don't be appalled by those who organize while they mourn
@RoyScranton @Revkin @KHayhoe @ClimateOfGavin @vaarloek @do_you_cli_fi_ @EricHolthaus @dwallacewells @NathanielRich Dude, i wrote a book called The End of Nature. In 1989. I don't think I'm in denial
@Revkin @RoyScranton @KHayhoe @ClimateOfGavin @vaarloek @do_you_cli_fi_ @EricHolthaus @dwallacewells @NathanielRich In the meantime, perhaps folks could keep up the fight? Huge win from Canada today, where court upheld First Nations challenge to tarsands pipeline. Amazing how often we win when we fight

@RockyMack1 No, it's that the carbon content is very high, and so it destabilizes the climate of the earth. (Its combustion also leads to lung trouble for many). It's not that it's 'evil,' so much. It's that its time has passed, and so it takes cynical politicians to keep it alive

@pettiplease @TomPerez yeah, one part that worried me was: "America’s all-of-the-above energy economy." this became a big point of contention some years ago, and the DNC dropped this in 2016 https://t.co/690L9MkmHE . I hope it isn't coming back.
@TVietor08 @DNC it's interesting--the issue goes beyond the donations. at least as drafted this proposal also recommits the party to an 'all of the above' energy stance, which was taken out of the platform after a lot of hard work in 2016
@sfpelosi @jonfavs @DNC @TheDemocrats yes. even i would have liked the chance, since i spent a lot of time on this as one of the platform writers in 2016.
@sfpelosi @jonfavs @DNC @TheDemocrats the other problem is a return to 'all of the above' language about energy. this is scientifically unwise, and i imagine politically as well
@jonfavs The proposal also includes a return to "all of the above" energy language which was taken out of the 2016 platform after extensive negotiation. This is neither scientifically nor politically wise
New DNC proposal would support an "all of the above" energy policy which the last party platform explicitly rejects. This is a bad idea, on both scientific and political grounds	https://t.co/wY5FVolzu5
