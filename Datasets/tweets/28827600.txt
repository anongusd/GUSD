@SwissTechie @Sun_Tzu___ @HeidiHasz @newmant360 @AlexanderGunz @realTheresaMey @zuludogm @SenWarren I agree, Daniel. Hence the apparently unintended consequences of FATCA.
@SwissTechie @Sun_Tzu___ @HeidiHasz @newmant360 @AlexanderGunz @realTheresaMey @zuludogm @SenWarren The topic was related to the Senate. But okay, since you're changing the subject: How do you explain the fact that there were more Democratic representatives who showed up than Republicans (the ones in charge)?
RT @CNN: This unpaid federal worker worries about keeping his child alive. He regrets voting for Trump. https://t.co/3Z0lS6zjKG https://t.c…
@Sun_Tzu___ @SwissTechie @HeidiHasz @newmant360 @AlexanderGunz @realTheresaMey @zuludogm @SenWarren As I'm sure you're well aware, neither Elizabeth Warren nor Democrats control any actions w/in the Senate. Interesting to note that you never call for Republican senators - you know, the ones actually in charge - call for a FATCA hearing.
@HeidiHasz Yes, lots. But among the first, know that any member of Congress can ask JCT for scoring assistance. Rep. Holding needs to specifically request a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model analysis, or a similar scoring analysis. Presumably, he'll be using ACA's revenue model.

@SolomonYue @newmant360 (8 of 8) By the way, you may want to check on “https://t.co/39y6ziqxNo” because it isn’t working from within Australia nor France. My understanding is that you are on the RNC’s Rules Committee. May I ask how you voted on yesterday’s  “unconditional support for Trump” resolution?
@SolomonYue @newmant360 (7 of 8) Bonus (despite our differences)! Contrary to what u may think, I'm much more of a policy person than a politics person. I have professional knowledge in 4-5 particular issues, but my bread &amp; butter is transp./infra. But I really excel in congressional processes. 🤗
@SolomonYue @newmant360 (6B of 8) In short, Rep. Holding is irrelevant for the next two years. You know it. I know it. Still, if he ever produces a bill in the 116th, with a score, then we can finally move forward in discussing it further.
@SolomonYue @newmant360 (6A of 8) Both DA and I truly believe that an RBT bill is a step in the right direction. No cosponsors are needed. Fast-tracking through committee is unrealistic. You know it. I know it.
@SolomonYue @newmant360 (5 of 8) The Holding proposal needs to be scored. Considering he is now in the minority, there is an almost non-existent chance that W&amp;MC will attached anything from this #TaxScam author to legislation which truly helps American families and workers. You know it. I know it.
@SolomonYue @newmant360 (4 of 8) No, I have not resigned from my non-leadership position on the DA tax task force. (Nice try, though.) Unfortunately, you’ll have to endure my name attached to the tax team e-mails for the time being.
@SolomonYue @newmant360 (3 of 8) As you have noticed, I am using my personal Twitter account. (Warning: SPOILER AHEAD.) This means I speak freely – not representative of any political party. The last time I checked, you’re the one with political speech restrictions, not me.
@SolomonYue @newmant360 (2 of 8) &amp; what “rule” are u referring to? (Specifics please.) Unlike u, I'm not employed by a party/PAC and therefore am not accountable to anyone, regardless of your accusations. Nor do I work for a MoC/cong cmte. Again, back up your “rule” that I'm supposedly violating.
@SolomonYue @newmant360 (1 of 8) Hello Mr. Yue- Thank u for contacting me. Again. Your only accurate statement is I'm a former Hill staffer, which, as you know, means I know what I’m talking about when it comes to Congress. But for the fun of it, let’s break down the falsehoods in your tweet.

@newmant360 @JuzzyUndies @SwissTechie @loondale @HeidiHasz @AlexanderGunz @realTheresaMey @zuludogm @farnorthsider @UNmigration @DavidCayJ Fact check: 1) There currently is no bill. 2) Without a JCT score, no Democrat *nor Republican* will support this [apparently invisible] "bill." 3) The reality is that - in Congress' eyes - expat tax problems pale in comparison to domestic tax problems.

@newmant360 @JuzzyUndies @SwissTechie @loondale @HeidiHasz @AlexanderGunz @realTheresaMey @zuludogm @farnorthsider @UNmigration @DavidCayJ (2 of 2) ...I would not support the Holding bill in its current form.

@newmant360 @JuzzyUndies @SwissTechie @loondale @HeidiHasz @AlexanderGunz @realTheresaMey @zuludogm @farnorthsider @UNmigration @DavidCayJ ⚠️That's not how it works. As a key #GOPTaxScam author, a Rep. Holding bill will never be attached to a Democratic tax bill in the 116th Congress, regardless of what RO, ACA, Keith Redmond, Monte Silver, or anyone else says. ∴ So yes, it would need to be individually scored. https://t.co/SbW7kvoVC9
@JuzzyUndies @newmant360 @SwissTechie @loondale @HeidiHasz @AlexanderGunz @realTheresaMey @zuludogm @JonBaugher @farnorthsider @UNmigration @DavidCayJ @TeamPelosi @DemsAbroad Yes. All congressional bills not signed into law by the president from the 115th Congress are dead. They can be reintroduced w/ the same language, or amended, by any of the 541 members of Congress at any time.
@newmant360 @SwissTechie @JuzzyUndies @loondale @HeidiHasz @AlexanderGunz @realTheresaMey @zuludogm @JonBaugher @farnorthsider @UNmigration @DavidCayJ @TeamPelosi @DemsAbroad Why would they? There's no bill in existence to support/oppose.

And I agree, Rep. Titus is a good potential RBT bill supporter. But the problem isn't that no one is a cosponsor, but rather that Rep. Holding hasn't reintroduced his RBT bill in 2019. Reason: he hasn't secured a JCT score.
@SwissTechie @newmant360 @JuzzyUndies @loondale @HeidiHasz @AlexanderGunz @realTheresaMey @zuludogm @JonBaugher @farnorthsider @UNmigration @DavidCayJ @TeamPelosi @DemsAbroad I respect that.

16) Overall, I'm pleased with what I'm seeing. I love the leadership LB K.Mack displays, and the confidence growing by QB M.Trubisky. Can't wait to see the Vikings get pounded!  #DaBears
15) ​Let's be honest, Lions QB M.Stafford has torched us over the years. In nearly all 4-3 fronts, there were QB hurries and near-knockdowns. This has got to increase for all division games.		#BearsvsLions🏈
14) ​Clearly, the Bears special teams need to practice onside kick situations. Most players looked like they didn't know how to respond. Know *beforehand* if you're gonna block, lateral, chase the ball, etc.		#BearsvsLions🏈
13) ​Starting around midway through the 3rd quarter, the Bears' defense seemed to have decreased in intensity. As this is a division game, this is unacceptable. The punishment must happen for 60 minutes.		#BearsvsLions🏈
12) ​I strongly disagree with the decision to allow RB T.Cohen back into the game so quickly after he took a big shot. You want to play the game, I get it. But he should have been checked out medically for longer than 5 minutes. Safety first, right, @nfl?		#BearsvsLions🏈
11) The left side of the Bears' O-line is in need of serious tweaking.  Every week, it's clear that the Bears' opponents watch the game tapes and see that our LG/LT get caught up, chop blocked, blitzed, or double-teamed. Needs immediate addressing, Coach!!!		#BearsvsLions🏈
10) ​Sorry, but Bears' K C.Parkey needs to be traded by the start of the 2019 season. There were just too many times in the first half of this season where he could (SHOULD) have put points on the board.		#BearsvsLions🏈
9) ​RB T.Cohen is a great short-pass receiver, amazingly quick, and overall versatile, no doubt. But Coach Nagy has to realize that J.Howard should be the first choice for screen passes, not Cohen. The statistical evidence backs this up.		#BearsvsLions🏈
8) ​Fortunately, I didn't see too many missed tackles today. But there are still too many high tackles happening by everyone in the secondary. This shit simply won't cut it if/when we arrive in the playoffs.		#BearsvsLions🏈
7) ​I think one of the toughest moments that Bears coaches and fans have to endure is when our team gets an illegal formation penalty called against us. But we can solve this confusion, Team Chi-town. LEARN. THE. RULE. It always kills our offensive momentum!		#BearsvsLions🏈
6) ​The Bears weren't robbed of the 2nd quarter fumble. It was Def. Coord. Fangio's fault for not picking up on the opportunity to challenge right off the bat. Damn shame it was a lost turnover.		#BearsvsLions🏈
5) ​*Now, let's discuss the areas for #DaBears to improve. I have a lot on my mind but I'll keep this short and sweet.		#BearsvsLions🏈
4) ​​Today's best bang for our buck has got to be TE T.Burton. Whether we ​need ​short yardage, a first down on a 2nd and long, or a key block on the line of scrimmage, this dude always delivers. My man!		#BearsvsLions🏈
3) On that first-half Trubisky rushing TD, the best part of that play was RB J.Howard's key block right up the gut. Well done, @JHowardx24!	#BearsvsLions🏈
2) To start, so many things clicked today, so I'll skip most of the positives and just touch on a few things I absolutely loved seeing.		#BearsvsLions🏈
1) Yessiree, it's that time again, yo! Let's do a quick post-game assessment of today's game between the Chicago Bears and the Detroit Lions.		#BearsvsLions🏈

I give the 1979 film "Escape From Alcatraz" 3.7 out of 5 stars. Cheesey by today's movie standards, but clever and such a great old school flick. https://t.co/MMtuGIZqAM
19) Final thoughts: we need to keep Trubisky and Parkey absolutely healthy and protected. My fav moments were the D causing multiple 3-and-outs. I look forward to seeing #dabears kick Miami's ass in two weeks. 🏈
18) One main highlight of the game for me was .@mrkevinwhite's sensational block on TB's #21👇🏽, when he was attempting to tackle Cohen. Well done, Kevin!🏈 https://t.co/TkEnAbftSK
17) The game's successful opening drive is noteworthy for a couple reasons. This drive in particular is the game tape the offense needs to watch to see how everything went smoothly: the blocks, reading the secondary, using the crowd to an advantage, etc. 🏈
16) Now that the passing game is seemingly established to Coach Nagy's liking, I'd like to see an increase of receptions for @TreyBurton8 and @JHowardx24, in addition to Howard getting more rushing snaps. Each week our opponent knows he's got the juice, so let's use him. 🏈
15) TB's defense is no joke. They have world-class athletes, too. So I have to believe that a big part of today's victory was a result of studying the game tapes. and prepping against an accurate scout squad. This is what happens when we plan appropriately throughout the week! 🏈
14) Bears' OL @Ky1eLong, a key piece of our attack, has now had a few false start penalties called against him this season. This sucks when it's, say, 2nd and 3. Please pay attention to the snap count, Kyle! 🏈 https://t.co/4SO2fk2VHZ
13) On an individual level, several Bears players could be considered totally invaluable to the franchise. But the real MVP of today's game should go to C @WhItehair76. Trubisky and Cohen wouldn't have had such a great game if it weren't for Whitehair and his stellar blocks. 🏈
12) In excelling at receiving, holding on to the ball, finding the gaps, and being so-so at blocking, Bears' RB @JHowardx24 is nearing a complete package. What I see lacking is the juke and shake-'n-bake stutter step. Still though, this young man is impressive! 🏈
11) Moving on to discussing the Bears' offense, let's just start by saying that fantasy players should immediately pick up Trubisky. His stats were among the best in franchise history today. Think about that.🏈
10) The Bears' defense was a gem today. I predict Mack's leadership will lead to teammates stepping up their game, and #DaBears will have no less than 3 Pro Bowlers. And if @AaronRodgers12 saw today's Bears' game, you better believe he's all👇🏽right about now.🏈 https://t.co/GrvJ64aE8W
9) There was a play in the 2nd qtr. when TB's RB attempted to stiff arm @Grindin_59, making him look like Conte in last week's bout w/ Pittsburgh. But as we all witnessed, nature would have none of that. https://t.co/HylH9OABdq
8) For the fourth week in a row, when Bears' LB Nick Kwiatkoski makes a tackle, the RB gains from forward progress. *This is unacceptable.* Coach Nagy and Def. Coord. Fangio better start talking about replacing Kwiatkoski w/ Irving or Fitts.🏈
7) Bears' rookie out of Delaware, DT @_BNichols92, in the 3rd qtr. showed why the Bears are among the most elite defenses in the league. TV commentator @chris_spielman correctly calls this the "Mack Effect," where Mack's stellar play elevates the play of all Bears' players.🏈
6) I'm not seeing enough physical contact by the Bears' CBs off the line of scrimmage. Too many opponents' WRs are talkin' smack and getting away w/o any bumps and bruises. They need to be reminded of who they're playing. Has the within-5-yards rule changed that I'm unaware of?🏈
5) And while the Bears' D played fantastic and the game ended up being lopsided, I have a big fear of our CBs getting too comfy with mediocre opponents' QBs. The Bears' Def. Coord. needs to really pay attention to the secondary to make sure that no one's getting too comfy.🏈
4) Khalil Mack's performance was yet again just downright incredible. Double teams? No problem. Triple teams? Easy peasy. If @52Mack_ stays healthy and consistent over the next 12 weeks, I guarantee you he'll be the league MVP. 🏈 https://t.co/lMznUliLUr
3) I'm loving our pass rush. Everyone on the D-line seems to have their own mission: Mack has expectations to fill, Hicks just loves to play, Goldman is lesser-known but trying to make a name for himself. The bottom line is that they're all on the same page. 🏈
2) Let's talk defense first. I'm a firm believer that defense ultimately wins games, and it's critical for the Bears' management to please fans with quality defenders. We faced challenges such as rain and rookies, but man, today did not disappoint.🏈
1) Wassup Twitterverse -- It's Week #4 and I just finished watching the Chicago Bears absolutely whoop the Tampa Bay Bucs, and wow, what a game.  With that, lemme offer my post-game analysis of our beloved, almighty Osos de Chicago.🏈		 #TBvsCHI | #DaBears		(Begin thread...)

I'm betting the Calif. U.S. Senate race is going to surprise a lot of people with how close it'll be. Either De León will win big time à la Ocasio-Cortez effect or Feinstein will squeak by after 2 recounts.
RT @girlsreallyrule: The next time @realDonaldTrump calls Elizabeth Warren "Pocahontas," I'm going to call him "Walks with Mushroom."
And finally, let's talk offensive blocking. @Ky1eLong scared me with that 3rd qtr. injury. But on the right side of the O-line the gaps aren't opening up as quickly, and pocket protection during play-action seems to collapse too easily. 		C'mon, Bears! 🏈
For the D, we're still getting burned too often on the opposition's passing game. Instead of ineffective nickel or dime packages, why not try out a standard four-man rush and letting the LBs roam more freely? Or, using @TheSamAcho or @RoquanSmith1 to blitz every 5-6 downs?
Lemme also state for those who may have missed it that Modelo beer did a wonderful commercial honoring Hispanic Heritage Month. It included Bears' legend Roberto Garza!
I applaud the Bears' decision to start LB @RoquanSmith1 instead of Kwiatkowski. With a win yesterday, albeit kind of ugly, the bottom line is that yesterday's defensive starters were effective, especially in the 1st half. I endorse this starting lineup vs. the Cards.
I have a problem with some of the offensive play calling. It seems the coaching staff is taking a talented QB (@Mtrubisky10) and trying to mold him to their preference. What they SHOULD be doing is forming an offensive playbook around Trubisky's talent &amp; what he's comfortable w/.
I'm still not impressed with the kicking special teams. There are still too many missed tackles considering we have a finalized roster for the regular season. Where's the dedication? The special teams playmakers? The natural talent? The open-field tackling skills???
RB @JHowardx24 needs more ball carries, pure and simple. Doesn't matter if it's a sweep, draw, screen, or North-South run. The bottom line is he gets the job done and Coach Nagu needs to recognize that Howard needs to be involved in EVERY 3rd down play.
After watching the #CHIvsSEA game, I feel like there needs to be an honest team assessment after Week 2. So let's talk @ChicagoBears football.
@anndalous I finally saw it. An ugly win, though. I'll have some thoughts on the game soon

@GusSwnsn @PurpleExpatOrg Nobody "forced" FFIs to do anything, despite this false claim being repeated on social media. Isn't it accurate to say they're simply businesses competing in the market looking to save money and make money? FATCA is 100% unfair for expats, but it works for busting the Manaforts.
@GusSwnsn @PurpleExpatOrg "Check myself?" Really Gus? I'm confused. You're attempting to attack me for simply asking you a question about FATCA..? We both support a full repeal. The only difference is the reasoning why.

@PurpleExpatOrg @GusSwnsn No such thing as FFI discrimination? As nations in written agreement, expats discrim'd against is the fault of both the US &amp; other countries. If foreign banks are worried about the 30% witholding penalty, nobody's stopping them from investing their money somewhere else, correct?

14) Apparently the NFL has gone through some rules changes since I last saw a game in 2012. Kick-off changes and something about head protection? I just hope that the @ChicagoBears stomp on some opponents this year, starting w/ Green Bay in Week 1.🎁🏈 https://t.co/MDLziUl5rb
13) If the #Bears' management is serious about wanting to do better than 5-11, they better do some serious investing. Trubisky needs quality protection. Those high ticket prices should translate to at least 2 Pro Bowlers. Winning is important but so is making Bears fans happy.🏈 https://t.co/lsYThm0UNS
12) Further thoughts: DeAndre Hall's dangerous tackle during a clear fair catch signal was simply uncalled for and extremely disappointing. Borderline fine-worthy, along w/ a required re-reading of the rulebook, and worth missing out on spec. teams for Game 1 of reg. season.🏈
11) I'll say that be #Bears' best highlights were a) when Trubisky passed to Burton for a 2nd qtr. TD, and b) when LB Kasim Edebali's executed a textbook monster tackle. 🏈
10) There was a RG wearing #71 but not on the roster. Who is he? And -wow- those pass protection skills are simply unacceptable. I know this is just preseason, but damn, this is your shot to show that you're an NFL blocker. If you can't stand the heat, get outta the kitchen! 🏈
9) RB Jordan Howard - I'm not 100% sold on him being our long-term workhorse for the offense. Are you really the next in line to greats like T.Jones, A-Train, N.Anderson, Payton, etc.? Jordan, if you're reading this, make me a BEARliever! 🏈
8) Ok, now let's touch on offense.  When the RB gets caught up at the line of scrimmage, I'm not understanding why the whole O-line isn't "pushing the pile," like, there's not even an effort to make forward progress. They need to watch old game tapes to see it done right!🏈
7) LB @nkwiatkoski27 seems to have a "Rudy"-like quality about him. He's got heart, for sure, but there were a few times where it took extra effort to take down a big FB or TE. Nick's got the weight, but needs the 💥explosion💥 to be game-ready for Week 1 of the reg. season 🏈 https://t.co/nOCuThKaSP
6) (Sigh.) For the second straight week, FS DeAndre Houston-Carson was tossed aside like a piece of garbage. DB coaches have 1 week to get their shit together and start teaching this young man some proper tackling.🏈
5) Every #Bears' fan wants to see us completely halt the opposition's run game. The 2018 talent is there, but where is the leader? Is there one? There are still too many holes in opponents' sweeps and draw plays. I've seen smaller gaps at the mall. Something we need to work on!🏈
4) DE @BigXander95 is a solid D-line back-up, and a potential starter. The few plays he was involved in, it was clear he was effective in pressuring the QB in and around the pocket. They must be doing something right over there at @utep! 🏈
3) CB Kevin Tolliver is an example of someone who learns from mistakes. Early on, he missed a few tackles and seemed unsure on coverage. Later, he sticks on WRs like a fly on flypaper, then makes a "Welcome to the NFL" big time tackle. Only needs to work on defending stiff arms🏈 https://t.co/44u4mOJKI6
2) The #Bears' 2nd and 3rd string D-line makes the occasional gang tackle, true, but what appears to be lacking is the "punishment" factor of a gang tackle. They need to make the opposing RB think twice, and make the Bears' defensive coordinator and assistant coaches be like 👇🏽 https://t.co/fOecd6c07m
1) We need to talk about defense for a moment. Let's start w/ DE @JBullard90. I really like what I'm seeing. He has great instincts for the ball and doesn't get his feet planted in the same spot for long. If he stays healthy, I'm predicting 10 1/2 sacks by week 16.🏈
After having just watched the #ChicagoBears' 3rd preseason game vs. Denver, I'm back to give my thoughts on the team. Keep in mind this is the perspective of someone who's been out of the country w/o Bears' access for 6 years... until now (via @nflgamepass) 🏈 		(Begin thread...)

@Brian_ship27 Damn, you're right about CIN being their 2nd game. But communist-ass NFL Game Pass has it listed as the first. Grrr! And I'm only basing Wims on that CIN game. Today's Bears are completely different to the 2012 team - the last time I saw a Bears game. :(  So I'm re-learning here.
9) To conclude, I'm really looking forward to catching the Bears next game. The LBs better watch those damn game tapes to see how they're not working together and missing open-field tackles and getting blocked without checking their peripherals. Love me some @ChicagoBears!🏈🧡🐻
8) Can someone please explain to me why the Bears one of the few teams without any cheerleaders? The Ben-Gals were great during this preseason game and clearly pumped up the crowd. We need that!! 🏈📣
7) I'm torn about this display of offensive play calling. I mean, the Bears don't have the kind of players to successfully run a west-coast offense; thus, stick to a pound-the-ground run game.🏈
6) The Bears' TE Adam Shaheen strongly deserves second-string consideration. He's proven he can catch and run, but remains untested in crunch-time blocking situations. Still, keep an eye on him, especially if Dion Sims goes down with a calf strain or a serious ACL injury.🏈
5) The Bears' #32, Deiondré Hall, is going to be on the highlight reel a couple times this season. I predict he'll be the team's leader tackler by Week #16 as long as he stays healthy.🏈
4) I'm sorry but Javon "butter fingers" Wims needs to be cut. Even scientists can't explain how the hell he missed those catches.🏈
3) The Bears had a shitload of missed tackles. Like, the embarrassing rookie mistake kind. Yes, I'm especially talking to you👉🏽, Tanner Carew (#63), Doran Grant (#35), and DeAndre Houston (#36). Can't tackle worth a damn. PLEASE PROVE ME WRONG! 🏈
2) The Bears' #19, Tanner Gentry, is one helluva fast player - but - possibly the worst blocker on the whole special teams. He has great potential to be a long-term special teams player but needs better all-around coaching. 🏈
1) The Bears' first string LB corps did not impress. At all. It's unclear if they're not putting in the training hours beforehand to get game-ready, or perhaps they haven't yet earned the trust of Coach Nagy. I will say, however, that LB #57, Kasim Edebali, showed great hustle 🏈

@zuludogm @KurtCouchman I know they campaigned for preventing tax evasion in general. Do you have a link to anywhere showing they campaigned specifically against RBT?
@zuludogm @KurtCouchman Interesting. I believe you said the same thing during the first tax debate. Clearly that ended up well for expats.
@zuludogm @KurtCouchman Considering the fact that the new transition taxes &amp; GILTI only exist because Trump signed them into law, isn't making hypothetical references to what previous administrations would or wouldn't do... pointless?
@zuludogm @KurtCouchman I agree, but your response has nothing to do with "the prior Administration wanting to preserve CBT."
Yet another disgusting example of voter suppression. https://t.co/Elnn35oNvZ
@zuludogm @KurtCouchman Which part of the U.S. Constitution refers to the Administration having the power to do what you claim? Cuz it definitely doesn't say that in Article I, Section 8.

@Pamella327 Hi Pam. To be fair, I do love me some Foley family, this is true. I realize our political views differ and that's fine and quite normal. What I'm dreading is seeing the future of America with the current do-nothing GOP in charge of everything.

@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer @CongressRaja When Norton's on the floor during votes, she needs to have in-person conversations with Dems who aren't cosponsors. If you're in DC, tell her chief of staff to have Norton do exactly this.
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer @CongressRaja I think it's pretty clear that he has other shit to worry about, like focusing on representing the people of IL-8. Just because he's silent on DC statehood doesn't mean he opposes it. My rep. also isn't a cosponsor of H.R. 1291, but I know that she'd vote for it if it came up.
@usconsulatemelb - I see that @CGSydney is accepting internship applications. Does the Melbourne consulate offer the same? If so, how do I apply?
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer Thank you for that. I've researched it and have come to the conclusion that if the people of DC overwhelmingly support statehood, then that's good for democracy; I support it as well. However, I still question your Democratic attacking efforts as ineffective lobbying. https://t.co/pzT1GIXw1M
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer Can you please share the source of this data?
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer My friend, the only recommendation I have for you and the DC statehood movement is for you to work WITH Democrats, not AGAINST them. Fact: You have 0% chance of statehood with GOP in power, and maybe 35-65% chance of statehood with Dems. It is completely foolish to troll ES&amp;RK.
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer Do you have any (credible) polling results on DC statehood? What percent of DC residents fully agree with you?
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer Simply because you haven't persuaded me yet for DC statehood doesn't mean I'm trolling you. It means you've failed thus far in making your case. I agree that DC should have full voting rights in Congress. Why is this not sufficient? Convince me to contact my rep in favor of this.
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer Let's be realistic. Rep. Kristnamoorthi is likely to be chair of the Sbcmte on Healthcare, Benefits, and Administrative Rules in the next Congress so you should do whatever to get on his good side. Norton serves on that subcmte too and we should expect her to be active.
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer Literally 99% of everything you just said is false. 1) I don't "troll" anyone. Me questioning your methods of advocacy ≠ trolling. 2) I support all efforts for full DC voting rights, and I'm open to hearing arguments for statehood. 3) I haven't sabotaged anything. 4) I'm cool.
"Thanks, GOP!"🙄 https://t.co/FjaYh04Paz
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer The bill I referenced was because there was no DC statehood bill back then. Not even Norton introduced it. And that's somehow everyone else's fault except Norton's??
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer You're accusing me of "rejecting DC citizens fighting for Dem accountability?" Umm, ok. https://t.co/OjMf7Qt6a9
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer Although I personally don't support statehood (yet), I do believe that: 1) congressional Dems should pass a DC statehood bill since it's in the DNC platform, 2) it's good (but not essential) to grab cosponsors, and 3) DC residents have been disenfranchised for far too long.
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer Using your same logic, H.R. 1905, the DC voting rights bill that passed the House in 2009, was a "major" bill, do you agree? Guess what, it only had *drumroll....* 1 cosponsor. Based on your argument, 217 Dems who voted for it are "Jim Crow." Ridiculous.
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer What proof are u referring to?The fact that Senate Dems didn't take up the DC voting rights bill? I see that 18 Senate Dems from the 111 Congress aren't even in Congress any more, so that's why I say constant educating and lobbying is needed. U aren't dealing w/ the same senators
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer A flagrant lie? As a longtime former DC resident, I fully understand DC politics. I *agree* with you on your DC rights campaign, but it is outright FALSE to state that Dems are hate-based w/ no real evidence to back that up. "But, but... they're not cosponsors" ≠ "they oppose"
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer What name calling? For example, Pelosi/Hoyer spearheaded the passage of the DC voting rights bill in the previous Congress. So just because they're not cosponsors of the current bill does NOT mean they are anything remotely close to "Jim Crow supporters."
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer Dem "opposition" is a false argument, considering that few Dems, if any at all, have stated that they oppose DC statehood. There needs to be more press, lobbying and education on the issue. Hill staffers know this. DC Vote knows this. Lobbying firms know this.
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer Do you think MLK Jr. would agree with your strategy of name-calling the same members of Congress who already voted to pass DC voting rights?
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer Disagree. The fact that DC statehood hasn't gone anywhere is because there isn't enough lobbying on the issue. Norton's done great, but there is no effectiveness from DC's mayor, shadow rep, and two shadow senators. More press coverage would help, too.
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer And by the way, looking to see who's cosponsored a bill is not the only way to see where a member of Congress stands on an issue. But I'm guessing you already knew that.
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer F me? lol, and I thought we were fighting for the same cause. But I think it's clear now why you're not making progress in your advocacy efforts. Attacking Dems instead of encouraging and educating them is the wrong strategy.
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer Is it really "Dems'" fault for not introducing a DC statehood bill in the 111th Congress, or Norton's fault? In any case, House Dems strongly supported DC Voting Rights bill. The fault in H.R. 1291 not going anywhere isn't Dems' fault.
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer Respectfully disagree. Just because a member of Congress doesn't cosponsor a bill doesn't mean they "oppose" it. A roll-call vote is the ultimate official record, much more so than finding out who cosponsored.
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer Another example: every Dem (+20 Republicans) is on record as supporting a vote on the Dream Act, but it's never gonna get a vote while GOP rules the House. In other words, despite all the cosponsors it doesn't mean shit.
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer Getting cosponsors on board is important, but more symbolic than the democratic whip actually doing his/her job in finding out if they'd vote for a bill or not. For example, not every Dem cosponsored ObamaCare but 99% of them voted for it. Same w/ your issue.
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer I hear you, but I think it's different when Dems are in the majority. Not only would your issue get a shitload of cosponsors, it'll actually be scheduled for a vote and passed, like Pelosi/Hoyer have already proven to do.
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton @chuckschumer Being that you and I both know that this bill/issue will never reach the floor of either chamber as long as GOP has control, we'll have to wait and see if Dems win a majority. Only then will the bill/issue get serious consideration, just like H.R. 1905 did in the 110th Congress.
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell @EleanorNorton Reps. Hoyer &amp; Pelosi aren't cosponsors of H.R. 1291. Is it accurate to call our top Dem leaders "Jim Crow supporters" too?
@ORDems @RonWyden @JeffMerkley Great quote of the day:		"Why do we need to elect Democrats? The constitutional checks and balances I learned about in elementary school doesn't appear to be working these days." -Valdez Bravo, OR Dems
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell I see what u mean and respect that viewpoint but I somewhat disagree. As u know, GOP controls committee business, not Dems. &amp; using your same logic, I see that Norton isn't a cosponsor of RK's H.Res. 493, despite serving on T&amp;I Cmte Dem leadership. Does that = Norton opposition?
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell Those 2 Dems have explicitly stated they oppose DC statehood?
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell If H.R. 1291 was up for a vote today, I'd bet that 90% of Dems would vote for it, including a majority of the 40+ Dems who aren't currently cosponsors.
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell Unless you've heard from RK&amp;ES that they specifically oppose DC statehood, you should be lobbying them, not attacking them. Surely you can agree that just because a member of Congress doesn't cosponsor a bill doesn't mean that they necessarily oppose it.
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems @ericswalwell Could you clarify that? You're saying Reps. Swalwell and Krishnamoorthi are "hate based Dems" because... they're not cosponsors of H.R. 1291?
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems You just might be right about that. Like Del. Norton said, "Why are we pushing this? Because we've tried everything else." I'm not opposed to your movement but I do fully recognize DC's struggles.
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems Wouldn't you agree that all Democrats are entitled to their own opinion on DC? For example, I'm a Democrat and I *strongly* support full voting rights for DC in the House, but I'm not sold (yet) on DC being the 51st state, especially over Puerto Rico.
@V4DC2 @CongressmanRaja @OversightDems I'd much rather have Rep. Krishnamoorthi over a Republican representing IL-8, and I suspect a majority of DC residents would, too
