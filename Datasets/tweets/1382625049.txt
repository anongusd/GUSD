THNAK YOU to everyone who participated in our #HLSchat - was fun and informative, thank you for all your insights!
No I think its here to stay just "under new management" and models tested will be voluntary and with a a GOP flavor.  #hlschat
I see a CMMMI that is less focused on mandatory modes and more interested in small scale testing, choice and competition in the market, patient centered care, benefit design and price transparency -- these are some of the "guiding principles" in the RFI. #hlschat
Right, I haven't seen a CBO document on A-M yet, bust staff estimates vary, and you're right there are a LOT of moving pieces.  #HLSchat
I too think it will be a better than expected result if A-M passes and enrollment continues to grow with premiums holding.  A better to end to a bitter start I agree.  #HLSchat
Re payfors: I've seen some ideas float around, OIG recommendations, etc, reductions to PAC providers, but nothing certain yet, if one policy besides CHIP survives the extender process, it will be CHCs.  #HLSchat
I like the 280 limit too Joel! Like I said, the Extender policies and issues like therapy caps will likely be rolled up into a larger omnibus package near the end of the year and not passed as standalone bills.  #HLSchat
CHC reauthorization legislation FYI: S. 1899 in the Senate (Blunt) and H.R. 3770 in the House (Stefanik) #HLSchat
Yes there is bipartisan language introduced in the House and Senate that can be quickly tagged onto a larger vehicle for CHCs.   Am looking for bill numbers to share.  #HLSchat
Our understanding is that the W&amp;M Committee will shortly release its list of bipartisan Medicare extenders and offsets to leadership, language is expected today. #HLSchat
But it is notable that these other critical funding programs, including Medicare extender policies, get lost in the noise of health and tax reform and won't get done till the dust settles on those.  #HLSchat
I don't see CHCs and SCHIP getting lost in the fray -- too important to too many Members and strongly bipartisan. Likely included in a late year wrap up budget package or continuing resolution. #HLSchat
I agree that success on mandate repeal will drive success on Alexander/Murray, even though the Freedom Caucus is not there yet. #HLSchat
Same here to that Matt.  #HLSchat
Yes, 340B VERY hot issue, my sense is it will be tied up in litigation and legislation for some time to come. CMS and OMB are satisfied with their decision, however.  Could be an uphill climb on both fronts.  #HLSchat
It certainly seems like Administrator Verma and CMS leadership are interested in work requirements for some portions of the Medicaid population.  Enjoys support among conservatives in the House and Senate.  #HLSchat
I'm told CBO analysts don't see the Marketplaces as fundamentally "unstable" anymore, a big turnaround from even six months ago. #HLSchat
I agree with Denise the robust exchange enrollment will force the hands of those holding back on CSRs, market stabilization efforts.  #HLSchat
Maine governor pledges to hold M'Caid expansion hostage until legislature finds a funding mechanism, but I think bigger implications are that even purple states - and some red ones - are seeing the tide turn on expansion efforts.  #HLSchat
Zombiecare - I like that!  To Denise's point, I think CHIP gets pushed to a wrap up budget deal in December. It still has bipartisan support but there is disagreement on how to finance it and for how long.
@Matt_R_Fisher @denise_e_hanna Agree Matt.  This a VERY political season and policy seems second to political wins.  NPR this morning called the tax bill an "existential necessity" for the GOP.
There is a "markup" underway of sorts at the Senate Finance Committee with a vote promised by after Thanksgiving.  The House will likely vote before they leave for the holiday. #HLSchat
I do think the election results from last Tuesday have lit a fire under GOP legislators to take assertive action on health and tax. #HLSchat
I think "comprehensive" ACA reform is on life support while tax policy and then immigration and infrastructure take center stage, but the White House continues to trumpet GrahamCassidy #HLSchat
Think we've jumpstarted the dialogue on this, but the House and Senate GOP and this White House desperately want to do something in health reform to the ACA, the individual mandate repeal saves $338B according to CBO #HLSchat
Also rumored to be included alongside the Senate tax reform bill is Alexnader-Murray HELP Committee market stabilization package ... wth two years of CSR subsidies available to plans. #HLSchat
Not a done deal yet but the House seems open to it.  Provider and plan constituencies remain strongly opposed #HLSchat
OK, welcome everyone to our November's #HLSchat. Big news breaking overnight: repeal of the individual mandate is included in the Senate version of the tax reform bill ... consequences on all sides!
Looking forward to an engaging #HLSchat today in 8 minutes on heath care reform November 2017: Who's Giving Thanks and Who's Not!
