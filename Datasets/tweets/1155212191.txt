Fentanyl caused 4% of US overdose deaths in 2011. It caused 29% in 2016. 5,456 people died by overdose in Pennsylvania in 2017.		The DEA says Mexican cartels are the primary distributors of fentanyl in PA. Securing the border isn‚Äôt a political football‚Äîit‚Äôs a moral imperative.

Let‚Äôs go Team USA! Bring home the gold! #WinterGames2018 #RedWhiteandBlueTrue https://t.co/eB9SCiI5Mc
The American people and our children deserved a better deal. 6/6
The dramatically increased domestic spending level in the bipartisan budget act is the ransom demanded to fund our military. We should not be forced to bankrupt our country in order to defend our country. 5/6
The new agreement increases funding the discretionary nondefense side of the government nearly 12% this year and 15% next year above current levels. This is not spending discipline. 4/6
We voted to fully fund our military 3 days ago and to continue funding other spending at 2017 levels pending a new budget agreement. 3/6
But in 1990s, we learned that to get to a budget surplus, we need not just healthier growth but we need to control spending too. 2/6
The tax cuts and jobs act is creating a healthier economy. Growth above 2.6% GDP will generate more tax revenues and actually lower the deficit. 1/6
Just as families across the country have to balance a budget and prioritize spending, so should the government. This budget deal piles on to the debt facing our nation, leaving taxpayers and future generations on the hook. https://t.co/2Im2EeRbXU
