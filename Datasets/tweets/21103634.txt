@MaraGay @jheil @esglaude @NicolleDWallace The biggest difference between 2016 and now is America’s obliviousness to Putin’s palms being on the scales in 2016. A distant second is America’s unawareness of Trump’s Campaign being investigated by the FBI for  illegal ties to Russia.

@mitchellreports @brhodes Then there’s Brennan who was ‘screaming from the rooftops’ to anyone who would listen abt 🇷🇺 election interference. Obama pretty much ignord him. For all of the good Obama did his failure to act judiciously will go down as one of the greatest judgment errors in Presidential hx.
@mitchellreports @brhodes When it came to Russia Obama “played dumb“. He had to know (2008 Blood Oath) McConnell would refuse his request to warn the American Ppl of Russia’s election interference/cyber acts of warfare. Obama was looking for a reason not to act decisively agst Putin and he found one.🤨😏
