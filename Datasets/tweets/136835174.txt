@Bachscore Glad to hear you like the city. It's unfortunate that the new, flashy stadiums so often overshadow cities like San Antonio where the environment as a whole makes for a great centralized event. That's why I'm thrilled the NCAA saw what SA can do and rewarded the city.
@Bachscore You know, it's possible they chose San Antonio because the city is actually a great host to this event. But you can go ahead and keep bashing San Antonio if you'd like.

@LiTTLe_Koy14 Interesting because New Orleans beat the Spurs in 3 of 4 in the regular season including the last game of the season when it was decided who would play each other in the first round. I love the Spurs but for the first time in my life, I can wholeheartedly say the Pels are better
@LiTTLe_Koy14 Nikola Mirotic had 30 points today, more than Anthony Davis for NOLA. In game 2, Davis didn't score in the entire 4th quarter and the Pelicans won. Jrue Holiday is a First Team All Defense player. Rajon Rondo is leading the team right now as well. The Pelicans are a great team!

@ajf8910 This has been so frustrating! Every possession is a foul!
@BallparkNerd Living in SA I was of course a Spurs fan, but Chris Paul was my favorite player. When the Mavs beat the Spurs in the 2006 playoffs I was so heartbroken that at 5 years old I decided to official root for the Hornets. I've stuck with it through Paul leaving and the name change!
@BallparkNerd He's always very respectful and doesn't say anything but I'm glad he did tonight.
This could not be more accurate. I witnessed this live in San Antonio. Anthony Davis doesn't get a single foul called in his favor. Not one! Yet if you dare breathe on James Harden it might be a flagrant foul. It's ridiculous! Love the energy from Coach Gentry! #Pelicans https://t.co/tfWiqsNT2I

@Britt_Ghiroli Even though they haven't spoken about an extension in years, could the Orioles say "Here's our best offer," and if he doesn't take it see if they trade him from there? It would be a shame to not even try to sign him.

@BallparkNerd @Orioles @Rangers Yes!!! Once I get home will write on my blog
@DAtkinsonOU @nmcdougal12 @Joelsherman1 He said that maybe the O's were worried he wouldn't hold up. That's not the case. They used him based on the situation the game called for.
@nmcdougal12 @DAtkinsonOU @Joelsherman1 Couldn't agree more.
@Joelsherman1 Maybe they won't trade him.
@Joelsherman1 And he got in because they eventually needed him, but your comment said you don't know why he didn't pitch full innings.
@Joelsherman1 Truly incredible how national writers aren't paying attention to the actual games. Gausman had a shutout in the 9th yesterday.

@emmaspan Especially when, after being so bad, they're close enough to think, "They can only be better." Hang around and anything can happen.
@emmaspan Outstanding article on a very important situation. As an O's fan, can't begin to imagine selling just 4.5 games back of first place.
@DanClarkSports That's why, despite a historically bad stretch, the Orioles are right there. Now if they actually play well, division very much in play.
@DanClarkSports Can still happen.
@DAtkinsonOU The fact that through how absolutely terrible the O's have been they're only five games back means they can certainly turn things around.

@ACummings40 @EvanDrellich @asben16 Maybe because it would've loaded the bases for Betts in a 1 run game? Clearly not intentional.
@steve_exposed Machado has been thrown at 1st pitch, clearly being intentional with no actual pitching involved. Sale doesn't ever miss that badly.
@steve_exposed You mean the evidence that the AB was: strike, ball inside, breaking ball outside, then he got hit. It was an actual AB. Twice now...
@steve_exposed 1st inning, 2 outs, 0-0 game is the same as 2-0, no outs in the 6th inning?
@steve_exposed And down by 1 in the 7th, chipping at the lead they'd throw at Benintendi to load the bases for Betts? Ok, right.
@steve_exposed Hitting Betts to bring up a home run hitter as the trying run in the 6th with no outs in a game you need to win is intentional?
@steve_exposed I agree it needs to end, but would you like to explain what bad decisions the Orioles have made?

Final score from the @valeroalamobowl in San Antonio: Oklahoma State 38, Colorado 8. A big win for the Cowboys and for the Big 12 #alamobowl
Colorado avoids a shutout. A touchdown late in the game with a two point conversion makes it 31-8 @CowboyFB over @RunRalphieRun. #alamobowl
Another touchdown by @CowboyFB. They now lead 31-0 in what has become a rout at the @valeroalamobowl.

It's now a 17-0 lead for @CowboyFB after a 4th down conversion and touchdown. @RunRalphieRun has to get going or else it will be a blowout.
Touchdown @CowboyFB makes it a 10-0 lead over @RunRalphieRun early in the 2nd quarter. #alamobowl

@ryguyblake Maybe, maybe not. If Davis starts hitting like he can and suddenly homers in 7 straight (or just gets hot) people will love him.
@ryguyblake It can go either way. Since the Orioles were in a position to win, I'm glad they tried. Better than 15 losing seasons.
@ryguyblake And then you're missing 31 home runs this year, two veterans, two clubhouse leaders, and two fan favorites.
@ryguyblake You can say that, but maybe Davis and Wieters would have said, " oh, they wanted us gone." You just never know.
@ryguyblake I get your point, I do. But the front office can't make moves based on what the fans think.
@ryguyblake You can't go with the general consensus. The O's were supposed to be in last place this year according to general consensus.
@ryguyblake Well, Wieters and Davis stayed, and now we're in first place this year. They decided not to give up last year.
@ryguyblake Who? And we were in second place at the time with only one team to catch, not three like the Yankees.
@ryguyblake I can't agree
@BMOREcenter I hope they do. We'll get a baserunner.

@BalSportsReport @OBPApparel Really tough.
@BalSportsReport @OBPApparel Yeah, but he hasn't played much at all recently.
@BalSportsReport Yup. Maybe include one of the outfielders.
@OBPApparel @BalSportsReport Yeah, I agree about Pearce.
@BalSportsReport Yeah, makes sense. If really like to get a trade for Norris. I'd love to be able to keep everyone, obviously.
@BalSportsReport I don't know about him replacing Chen though. Shouldn't he replace Drake?
@BalSportsReport So you think Young is gone this week?
@BalSportsReport Is Paredes on this roster?
@BalSportsReport Who would you keep as your outfield?
@BalSportsReport Agree with defense. I just really like having him in key spots. I'm glad I'm not making the decision right now.
@BalSportsReport I just don't see letting him go for a week of Parmalee. He had three homers yes, but is he that much better defensively?
@BalSportsReport Pinch Hitting ability. Can hit righties and lefties. Has a great arm.
@DAtkinsonOU @OsUncensored Are you forgetting how he did last year?
@CamdenFanatic @OsUncensored Absolutely not. Flaherty plays everywhere, and is finally starting to hit.
@DAtkinsonOU Lough has hit a lot better. Has some power, but has had good at bats and has started slapping ball to left a lot more.
@DAtkinsonOU @CamdenFanatic Only problem I have is getting rid of people for one good week from Parmalee.

@DevanFink They're not the best, but to me WAR and xFIP don't tell me how good a pitching staff is.
@DevanFink Right. Cause WAR explains everything.
@EricLock_ @Orioles He wouldn't be pitching today.
@DevanFink I don't agree with you saying the Orioles have one of the worst rotations in baseball.
@mlosten @OriolesDC Very true. If Wright and Gausman give good starts, maybe look to trade Norris for sure, I don't know about Chen.
@OriolesDC Totally agree. Never enough. Have almost same record at same time as last year and that turned out ok I think.
@OriolesFanProbz It's hard to beat any team 4 times
@OriolesDC I know it's hard to win 4 against one team, but the way the Phillies have played...
@nottheflaredog @DAtkinsonOU Great options. That's why I would look to trade Norris.
@nottheflaredog @DAtkinsonOU @BirdsEyeViewBal Just a thought
@nottheflaredog @DAtkinsonOU @BirdsEyeViewBal As odd as this might sound, maybe McFarland develops into a starter.
@nottheflaredog @DAtkinsonOU @BirdsEyeViewBal I Agree
@DAtkinsonOU @nottheflaredog @BirdsEyeViewBal Maybe, but not an absolute necessity.
@nottheflaredog @DAtkinsonOU @BirdsEyeViewBal I Don't see the need in trading a good consistent pitcher for just another LHP

@OsUncensored Yes, that's the one thing where I don't know what to do. I'd say 6 man rotation, but Buck apparently says no
@OsUncensored And yes, it's more than injury, but he deserves a chance. You don't lose a spot after a few bad starts and a DL stint.
@OsUncensored It's an unwritten rule. If you're a starter who has proved you can play you deserve atleast a chance to regain your spot.

@DC_TBLDaily Good numbers but we didn't sign them because we didn't want the longterm. It's not like we wouldn't have wanted them this year.
@Jim_Eichenhofer Going in I predicted winning game 2. This will give team confidence that they can play with GS if they play smarter.
@usnfish Huge going forward. Pelicans CAN win against them.
@usnfish It is. Shows we can fight against this team. If they can play smarter defense it might be closer in the next games.
@masnRoch Why is everyone saying confident he'll play this season? Does this mean he'll definitely not be back until after all star break?

@EutawStReport @BirdsEyeViewBal But it saves money that they can use now towards extensions of people we need.

@SethDavisHoops @jaredmaSc26 So did I. But it's time to forget the bracket and enjoy the games. These games are amazing!
@BonnieBernstein Same here
@j10fernandez Let's not.
@kurt13warner SFA over Utah.l, Eastern Washington over Georgetown, BYU over Xavier, Dayton over Providence.
@ESPNLunardi Who in the Midwest has the best chance to beat UK. Texas? I really want to pick them in the elite eight. Thoughts?
@SethDavisHoops Do you think Wofford over Arkansas is a good pick?
@GottliebShow Do you think WOF over ARK, BYU over Xavier, Dayton over Providence, TX over Butler, SFA over Utah, and E Wash are good picks?
@ESPNLunardi Should Texas be worried today?
@TheStudentSect I agree. Put BYU in the BIG 12 and see how they do.
@TheStudentSect Absolutely. Committee has to see that.
@TheStudentSect I hope so. It would be a shame if they don't. Do you not think they could beat a 5 or 6 seed in the first round.
@TheStudentSect I get how that's the problem. I just dont understand how one good win teams like BYU get in over a far more talented Texas
@TheStudentSect I get that, but BIG 12 teams struggled in Lubbock and FT. Worth while Texas did not. Those were not easy places to play.
@TheStudentSect They should not be punished for losing by 2 to the BIG 12 Champs. They are much better talent wise then must on the bubble.
@SethDavisHoops BYU had one good win and their in? Texas would sweep the WCC except Gonzaga.
@iamtyannajones You're going to win American Idol! You are the best! Keep it up!
@SethDavisHoops Yes they would. Absolutely. Would Murray State win more than 6 games in the BIG 12? No. This is a terrible argument.
@Jim_Eichenhofer I think it's favorable for us to play PHX and Sac. Twice. Maybe get a first round preview with the Warriors.
@ESPNAndyKatz Who's most worried?
@Jim_Eichenhofer Is he a free agent this year? Would we sign him back?
@thebirdwrites Oh ok. So you think it'll happen pretty much right after that?
@thebirdwrites So you're saying it wouldn't happen soon?
@thebirdwrites I totally agree. When do you think it'll happen. I need this soon, as I've been dreading a possible CP3 relapse.
@thebirdwrites Are you absolutely sure the Pelicans will extend him this year?
@TheHoChen It's amazing the blocks they get. They change so many shots.
@TheHoChen Yes, but they look different lately. Goes back to Kansas game. They started playing desperately, like they need to.
@TheHoChen @TexasMBB I honestly think they could go far in the NCAA tourney, as well as this BIG 12 tourney. Just need to play energized.

@SultanofStat Ideally, when do you take first pitcher.
@AR_Shearer @ESPNFantasy I expect the same. He's 35, going to Safeco. It'll be a way down year.
@MedcalfByESPN BYU should not be in
@abielak11 @BPredict @Dan_Lyons76 Texas has played good teams all year, unlike BYU. Yes, Texas has few good wins but they have no bad losses
@BPredict I think they don't deserve to make it. It's one thing for Gonzaga, but BYU doesn't play enough good teams.
@RWSkeletons When does the next real world start
@Jim_Eichenhofer Well yeah but technically OKC is in 8th right now?
@Jim_Eichenhofer So if playoffs started today, who's in
RT @thebirdwrites: Knock. knock.		Who's there?		The 8th seeding in the Western Conference!
@dsallerson @PelicansNBA Thanks!
@dsallerson @PelicansNBA Do you think we'll get an Evans update tonight?
@shawndp1 @Jim_Eichenhofer This is not good. We were so close to being all healthy
@NOLAJake We don't need this!
@Jim_Eichenhofer Did Evans look really bad? Should we worry?
@NOLAJake Was it bad? Please no.
@Jim_Eichenhofer OKC keeps winning very close games and relying on Westbrook. You've gotta think that can't last forever.
@TheStudentSect Who are the others?
@MTVshelbs Once Upon A Time
@Jim_Eichenhofer Take care of your business. Theyve shown they can beat anyone so win the ones you should and the rest will happen. Just win
@TheStudentSect This Murray State Belmont game has to be the most fluid, clean, and fun game I've ever seen.
@TheStudentSect Oh ok.
@TheStudentSect So 1, why are they ranked and 2, does that mean Belmont is not a bid stealer like Ill St?
@TheStudentSect Does Murray State make an at large?
@TheStudentSect If Colorado State loses tonight in a tough environment in Logan, are they out?
@TheStudentSect So for other bubble teams, Illinois winning is good?
@TheStudentSect @BirdstoneWINS Oh ok I see. This March thing is pretty fun.
@TheStudentSect @BirdstoneWINS But shouldn't ST. Mary's have a better chance to beat BYU than Portland?
@TheStudentSect @BirdstoneWINS What twist?
@TheStudentSect Is A&amp;M out now?
@TheStudentSect Ok thanks.
@TheStudentSect Who does texas want? Tulsa or Cincinnati?
@JustJem24 Go pels!
@TheStudentSect Totally. It'll be a fun next week and a half.
@TheStudentSect I guess so. This opens up a door for someone else though don't you think?
@TheStudentSect I Get that a loss at ARK isnt  bad but at this point shouldn't any loss set you back Its not like LSU has a ton of good wins
@TheStudentSect Where would you say they are right now?
@TheStudentSect If they lose at home to Tennessee and then lose at Arkansas that is not a tournament team in LSU.
@BPredict @BrettHudson I get it. Need this one!
@BPredict @BrettHudson What if they lose tonight, but beat K-State then win 2 or 3 in BIG 12 tournament?

@ESPNLunardi Do you think Texas will make it to the tourney with two wins then one in the vIG 12 tourney? #AskLunardi
@GottliebShow I don't either. Texas is a way better team.
@GottliebShow deserve to be in but Davidson, Temple, Tulsa, Michigan state and other teams do I really don't get it.
@GottliebShow You tell me a Texas team in the BIG 12 that has lost at least 4 games that were so close and one being IN Kansas doesn't...
@Jim_Eichenhofer All winnable games for us except maybe at Dallas. Even there though we could win.
@DC_TBLDaily It just makes me sad that he wanted to stay. I think it's a good move in the long run but he was my favorite player so its hard
@MedcalfByESPN Why on the bracketology are UT Davidson Purdue and UCLA all last 4 in but UT and DAV are 12 seeds while UCLA and PUR are 11?
@MedcalfByESPN Assuming a L in KU. 2 wins, 1 vs baylor, then most likely 1 win in tourney maybe 2. I think a 20-13 texas team should be in
@MedcalfByESPN No never said you did. Asked for your honest opinion. Know potential maybe doesnt help but I think UT is better then others
@MedcalfByESPN Do you honestly think Texas won't make it? Win last 2 at home with 1 being vs baylor and 1 win in BIG 12 tourny isn't enough?

@Jim_Eichenhofer Like what Ajinca is doing Provides good scoring, size in 2nd unit. Asik is underwhelming so far but I feel he will be key
@Jim_Eichenhofer Davis amazing. I expected a little better from Asik, we know Ryno will get better. I honestly feel a streak coming.
@masnRoch Yeah it really does. Do you sit on a particular side of should he leave or stay?
@masnRoch Oh well that's not good. Do you expect an announcement soon?
@masnRoch Are we to believe this thing is over for at least another year? I hope so, but dont want false security.
@masnSteve If Beeston stays, and it's found out Toronto talked without permission to Duquette, can't they get in a lot of trouble?
@masnSteve What Toronto is doing I think is humiliating. Find your own GM
Every game the Patriots find some new way to cheat. Yeah but what a great coach they have. #lucky #DeflateGate #cheaters #shrinkage
@SrDavidwesley4 I'm calling it, we're winning 8 in a row!
@PelicansNBA @TyrekeEvans @TheofficialEG10 @AsikOmer We have lots of games at home and we play better against the west. Only 3.5 games out
@PelicansNBA @TyrekeEvans @TheofficialEG10 @AsikOmer For all those saying fire Monty how will that help? Break team up halfway through year?
@Jim_Eichenhofer Should we be worried or is a comeback going to happen? Are the Knicks just making everything?
@danconnollysun Do you not think this is really unfair to the Orioles?
@masnRoch How can MLB help Toronto. Even with the MASN thing MLB cannot support one team more than another.
@masnRoch Do you seriously think it's fair what the blue Jays and MLB are doing? Totally meddling in our org., hurting us in market...
@OriolesUpdates8 Truly unfair

@BirdsEyeViewBal If we had a clear GM
@OsUncensored Lefty, versatile, fast, ok fielder,  power especially in Camden, could become good opposite field hitter.
According to @JonHeymanCBS, Max Scherzer has a 7 year deal with Nationals. $ amount unknown.
@Jim_Eichenhofer I liked Gordon starting with Evans on the bench If all healthy it allows a better second team with Evans QPON, Jimmer, RYNO

@masnSteve So unfair leaving us now no wonder Cruz Marakakis left and no one has been signed he's sabotaging us especially in division.
@Jim_Eichenhofer Better defense. Energy? Need a spark anyway possible ASAP
@Jim_Eichenhofer Very disappointing. 0-7 on road against east? Awful. Need a winning record on trip extremely badly.
@Jim_Eichenhofer What do you know on this Pelicans, Austin Rivers trade?
@Jim_Eichenhofer 4  but honestly 5 is not too much to ask for. Need to beat PHI, NY, and BOS should win in DET and could beat TOR.

@BirdsEyeViewBal I agree. Speed, power especially in Camden, decent defense and flexibility of position. I like him
@BirdsEyeViewBal Good. I got upset at those rumors. What about Rasmus what do you think?
@BirdsEyeViewBal I really hope we can keep those 4 you mentioned along with Norris and Davis. Any way we trade Norris or Chen for Eithier?
@BirdsEyeViewBal Do you think they'll trade Davis during year? Is Norris gone?
@BirdsEyeViewBal Oh I know. Just in general do you see is breaking up the team or keeping lots of it together.
@BirdsEyeViewBal Off season. Off the field this year and possibly in season trades and next off season Any long term extensions during year?
@BirdsEyeViewBal This is going to be a very very big year. What do you see them doing
@BirdsEyeViewBal True but do they want to now build again for 3,4,5 years from now. We can't give up whole team.
@BirdsEyeViewBal We cant lose 2 starters next year Maybe Walker develops and we dont necessarily need Pearce Keep Oday or Hunter dont need 2
@BirdsEyeViewBal Keeping Gonzales too
@BirdsEyeViewBal We can trust Jimenez to get better and Gausman and Bundy to be ready for rotation. I'd think sign Tillman long term also
@BirdsEyeViewBal Yeah it will. Idk what's going to happen but we have to keep core. To me We NEED Weiters, And 1 of Chen or Norris if...
@BirdsEyeViewBal Markakis, cruz and miller
@BirdsEyeViewBal Yes, but they were expected to actually go over My honest guess is Duquette and Co thought and chose Weit Chen Dav over...
@BirdsEyeViewBal hopefully from us. This saved money has to go somewhere.
@DC_TBLDaily Need to keep Weiters for sure, at least one of Chen or Norris if not both Davis if possible All that saved money better pay off

@EutawStReport Yeah but now a trade failed, who will we get. I'm just a little worried right now
@EutawStReport It could be. But who right now is in right field. I love Pearce, but not starting in right
@EutawStReport I just can't and wont get it. I get his numbers, but he's more then numbers. He was our rock, our guy. He's so special
@EutawStReport Anytime there was a hit to right we trusted his arm he could hit anyone left or right and he'd catch almost anything.

@EutawStReport Error was Schoop
@EutawStReport If that's how they think they'll make the playoffs, they're in for a rude awakening. It'll work to win a few games, that's it

@masnRoch Could they call the game???
@MarkWJZ Hope you're right
@cdwill77 You are totally right. That was not a good call
@MarkWJZ They haven't done great, but are starting to piece it together. Still some moves I dont like (Gaisman) but they can do it I think
@MarkWJZ I'd say it's pretty good from the O's perspective Could be 3.5 ahead of NY tonight and 7.5 from Boston Starting to separate are we?
@MarkWJZ He is good, but win tonight, win tomorrow, and they will be crushed. And we always seem to do against those types of guys dont we?
@MarkWJZ So we should sweep them right, right?????
@EutawStReport @BirdsEyeViewBal Amen
@EutawStReport @BirdsEyeViewBal Uhhh I can't listen to this becuase I live in SA and must listen to Texas guys. Whats he saying?
@OriolesUpdates8 Hopefully he can get a couple quick innings
@OriolesUpdates8  I'd be happy with 5 innings. Turn it over to Brach after. Glad we didn't use pen last night
@EutawStReport There we go!!
@EutawStReport Thanks so much!! Doing what I can
@EutawStReport Thanks! Ok I'll chance that right now. Material wise though, you think it's good

@EutawStReport Amazing
@EutawStReport Yeah it seemed relieving back then, but now you think and Jake could be our future with Gausman, Bundy, Tillman. Ah who knows
@EutawStReport No I know who we got. I'm saying what did we really get back in that trade? Feldman is gone and we didn't go to playoffs so..
@EutawStReport I try so hard to think "Jake will get over this little run" but what could have been you always wonder. What did we get back?
@BirdsEyeViewBal OH. MY. GOSH

@SchmuckStop a very possible sweep?? Come on we'll win 2 I know we'll beat tanaka
@EutawStReport It;s too easy to get our hitters out. We swing at so many balls it's unbelievable. If Jimenez was against us he'd do good
@EutawStReport Totally with you. Get first to win series. I know Tanaka has been good but I mean we did beat NY when he first pitched to us
@EutawStReport Did you see w're only 2.5 back with NY winning. A sweep of New York and we will be in business
@JAntweil If I remember correctly, we didn't beat him, but he pitched and we won that game. Not on him but we won
@JAntweil It's just to make you guys feel better so you won't be sad when the O's sweep you!!
@EutawStReport I wanted NY to beat TOR. If NY wins tomorrow, well be 2.5 out and 1 back of NY and now we play NY and can take care of them
@MichelleDBeadle I love your show so much. I really want to see it live. Could you get me tickets?

@EutawStReport RIght
@EutawStReport Ha yeah!! It'll happen. Its unbelievable that we always complain about picthing, yet 8 straight QS and we're 4-4. How???
@EutawStReport Yeah, playing well we could very well be sitting pretty. We will start hitting and pitching at the same time right?? Right??
@EutawStReport It's bad, but we are within striking distance of the division lead and certainly wild card
@MichelleDBeadle @michaelkboston Annoying?????? Michelle Beadle is awesome!!!!!
@Britt_Ghiroli No chance? He's pitching really well. That trade doesn't look good right now.Not saying Arrieta is star, just better
@Britt_Ghiroli Looks like Cubs are listening for deals on starters. Any chance O's try and get Arrieta back?
@RealSkipBayless Dont worry you'll be back!!!!!
@SultanofStat With Plouffe injured, I need to pick someone up. Luis Valbuena or Adam Eaton for a temporary utility player
@CharissaT Because he's a crybaby!!!! Such a bad sport He can't handle the success of others

@djkhaled So what have you heard from the "streets". Is the air condition on in the AAA. Because San Antonio is winning right?
@susanslusser I know, he has to proove himself. Hopefully this teaches him how to act better in the future
@susanslusser You're right on the lack of concern. My point is Manny was so mad, he didn't even realize what happened, who knows.
@susanslusser Ok. BTW did you see Machado hit Red Sox catcher on backswing and immediately asked if he was ok
@susanslusser Was that on purpose too???? Did Aybar smile?? See, it happens

@SultanofStat Seth Smith or Corey Dickerson.Smith has been very good to me I picked him up on Ope. day what should I do
@scott_pianowski I know this might sound silly, but Corey Dickerson or Seth Smith, and then either of those two or Gregory Polanco?

@scott_pianowski Ok just asking
@scott_pianowski What if I try Santana while he's hot? Is there another SS out there I should try or just stick with Cabrera.
@scott_pianowski What do you think between Danny Santana or Evereth Cabrera
