Social justice, untethered from biblical definition, is the secular version of theocracy.
A desire for justice exists because it is written on our heart, and it is Jesus who is the one doing the writing (Rom. 2; Col. 1)
Without Christ, there is no assurance of justice, no equity in what is required to be just, or divine foundation for justice, which is why ‚Äújustice‚Äù is incoherently applied to both minimum wage laws and a right to abortion.
Do not believe for one second that *any* party that promotes this has any idea what justice really is. Justice can have no part in evil, which is what this is. https://t.co/DvUldbl61z
