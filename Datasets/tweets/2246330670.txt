@Seb_os442 @BreitbartNews @TagleDeborah Unless you can state factual data with some type of analysis then your words are just words ...@JussieSmollett has a good idea of what is not going on in LA, we don‚Äôt only care about LA. He pretty much summed up Hollywood. Thanks
@Seb_os442 @BreitbartNews @TagleDeborah I have, and a gallon of milk was like $7. Here it‚Äôs like $3.50. https://t.co/HuUaUOHU8s
@Seb_os442 @BreitbartNews @TagleDeborah Yeah since we all don‚Äôt know Hollywood stars live in gated fenced communities? I live in the middle of America. Thanks for your peanut gallery comment.
Do democrats want to pay taxes when @realDonaldTrump is the president? No. Just because they don‚Äôt ‚Äúlike him.‚Äù But if it‚Äôs @BarackObama then yeah ‚Äútake my money.‚Äù I don‚Äôt want my taxes $ going to abortions. Do democrats want their money going to a wall? The tides turn...
@AOC If you can‚Äôt think of a plan then that‚Äôs really good, try crap, see what happens.... no big deal huh? Cows give off the most carbon emissions..but you love animals? But @CoryBooker wants to rid of them and cheese. Omg. Crisis! All time low for the left. @realDonaldTrump #KAG
@AOC U want to ‚Äúfight‚Äù climate change? How about the #veterans who fight4 us? 0.01F temp change is more important than them or unborn child? laughable that the left thinks that‚Äôs our ‚Äúbiggest threat‚Äù. I would luv4 U2explain the sci. data proof of concept but you nvr have any answers
@dustin_curtis @JussieSmollett @POTUS Nah, @JussieSmollett deserves to be in jail. Committed a felony. This story got that much coverage and now mainstream media forgot about it because doesn‚Äôt fit their agenda. Don‚Äôt need an apology from him, he can sit in a cell. Justice is justice.
@thespinzone Creighton ML tomorrow.
@dougRESISTance @cwh008 @DonaldJTrumpJr That‚Äôs terrible photoshopping like is this your video skills? https://t.co/HV7AQk7X28
@cwh008 just looked your credentials up. You have no law degree. You actually are no where in the drake system... unless this is you with the extraordinary video skills? https://t.co/I48zXRQYPj
@cwh008 @EdKrassen @AOC @BarackObama Didn‚Äôt go to Creighton. Look the name up. Or do you need assistance in googling information?
Yeah Obviously. He specifically targeted trump supporters &amp; @realDonaldTrump w/ the ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù hats they were wearing and the ‚Äúthis is MAGA country‚Äù they said. Why is this okay? This was calculated. It‚Äôs disgusting. It‚Äôs unreal how he actually thought of this. What a terrible actor. https://t.co/hgGJMJZrNI
@thespinzone Well we suck lol
@Jordan_Sather_ @TrumpSuperElite Maybe fire the meteorologist? Lol
@Jordan_Sather_ @TrumpSuperElite üòÇüòÇüòÇIf this is real. Then @MSNBC just dug their own grave lol this is getting so flippant they have lost it
RT @Nevy_LongBottom: @AOC First I would have an actual budget plan for how you will pay for this? U think global warming is the most danger‚Ä¶
RT @Nevy_LongBottom: @FoxNews Thank you @DeptofDefense @realDonaldTrump and especially @ICEgov &amp; all of our #soldiers of all branches of th‚Ä¶
@charliekirk11 @PJones_32 Well now @CNNPolitics @cnnbrk @CNN @MSNBC @donlemon all avoid the situation... and now focused on Robert kraft...Pay people to put a noose around your neck, have them wear #MAGA hats, call you gay and black, and now it‚Äôs just Robert kraft because he voted @realDonaldTrump
@KimStrassel @WSJopinion How many more pathetic things can they do? @JussieSmollett we need another fake act. No wonder you are a terrrible actor. Felony committed and back fires on what you intended to do. #WalkAway
@AOC Yeah let‚Äôs just sit in a circle and come up with ergonomically solutions that u don‚Äôt know how to pay for but to just have people believe that you know what you are talking about but you can‚Äôt even explain a budget besides 70% tax. Professors will be very good w/ free school?#KAG
@AOC @realDonaldTrump #MAGA
@AOC First I would have an actual budget plan for how you will pay for this? U think global warming is the most dangerous threat2 human kind? U know bacteria live in hot springs @Yellowstone over 100F?&amp; u R more worried about finding a one cell bacteria on mars than a child in a womb
@BreitbartNews @TagleDeborah And no one cares what she says because she doesn‚Äôt even know why she hates him just assuming things make an Ass out of U and ME (ASUME). Just like they did with cavanaugh and this joke clown @JussieSmollett... it‚Äôs a disgrace this is all they have... let‚Äôs listen to Hollywood?Lol
@BreitbartNews @TagleDeborah And she lives in a house that has a wall built around it...riddle me that ...
@EdKrassen That will get denied in the Supreme Court lol ... wow you guys are really running out of options aren‚Äôt you...@JussieSmollett ... trying to remove him off the ballot in a state... lol there is no legality that someone has to show tax returns and who really cares?
How does this keep happening to @BluejayMBB. Better yet, how the hell do they keep allowing this to happen? #Smh so frustrating. Especially when they are playing at home. Unreal.
@AOC Now look how dumb you are, as if we didn‚Äôt know already. You can never explain anything. ANYTHING.
@RealCandaceO @CNN @JussieSmollett It‚Äôs illegal under federal &amp; stage law to file a ‚Äúfalse police report‚Äù. Depending on the state, it can be either a misdemeanor or felony, carrying a penalty of potential prison time and/or fines. Additionally could B ‚Äúinticement‚Äù which is illegal @JussieSmollett =a joke #JailTime
Wow. after this evidence was found. Creating fake animosity making it look like the right was being racist and homophobic when he was the one who orchestrated it he defines that they are the separators the left to do that is disgusting. #KAG2020 https://t.co/Fn0WiaQlyt
Is @MZegarowski1 out or not vs #Xavier tonight? I can‚Äôt find anything besides an article saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúplausible he might be back‚Äù.. with no affiliation to #Creighton ????
@thespinzone Is he not out now? I can‚Äôt find it anywhere just says questionable plausible ?
@cwh008 @EdKrassen @AOC If you want to give more money to the government that‚Äôs your prerogative Mr. history buff. @cwh008 ...I would rather them not touch my money... I spend it better than they do (remember @BarackObama had more debt than all other presidents COMBINED). great budgeting of my $ #Obama
@CNN @CNNOpinion You think the @Patriots #TomBrady #BillCallahan #RobertKraft or @realDonaldTrump care? No that‚Äôs why they are the #GOATs #GOAT
@EdKrassen A 70 to 80% tax on the super wealthy like @AOC proposes would cause a dep-/Rec-ssion, loss of ten of millions of jobs. Maybe slight increase (3-5%) but not these extreme taxes. Even 40% would be crippling to the economy, jobs, &amp; payrolls. U hav2 b ignorant 2 think that would work
Anyone else notice @realDonaldTrump is glad to interview with liberal media outlets like @cnn @MSNBC @CBS @ABC and when was the last time I Democrat/liberal president or even presidential nominee take an interview with @FoxNews ? This is part of their plan. Hide the truth. #KAG
If #democrat #liberal #socialist think walls/barriers R medieval &amp; dnt work @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @KamalaHarris @AOC y dnt u do an experiment- tear down the existing walls/fences in CA, deploy ur ‚Äúdrones‚Äù,&amp; prove ur hypothesis tht they dnt work?#BuildTheWall @realDonaldTrump
They say all these great things but can‚Äôt explain how to pay for any of it.. because it‚Äôs statistically impossible and that‚Äôs what Venezuela has figured out. What happened to working your ass off and not wanting hand outs? Unreal #KAG. @realDonaldTrump
Got $200 extra on my paycheck thanks to @realDonaldTrump #MAGA #KAG. If we have a socialist like @KamalaHarris @AOC -ppl get free Edu &amp; health um that‚Äôs how u get crap doctors&amp;crap profs. will get paid less&amp;no1 will do it&amp; economically it‚Äôs impossible2 pay for just one of those.
How the hell is @BillWalton still calling games? He talks more about libraries, books, mountains, and global warming...than the actual game that he is supposed to be calling @espn? Lord he is terrible.
Everyone who jumped on buzzfeeds @cnn @CNNPolitics @cnnbrk #CNN #FakeNews claim that trump told Cohen to lie, well Mueller‚Äôs team just said that is completely false. Haha see what happens @CNN you should wait for #facts u fools.
@MichaelAvenatti Lol can u pay trump the money u owe from stormy Daniels case and your IRS and eviction of law office? Remember when you cancelled your rally in Texas during trumps cuz u were gonna have like 15 ppl there...lol u are a joke attorney and a joke in general.
@bakermayfield Is a prodigy of Drew Brees I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs going to get all the accomplishments that Drew has but I think he has the same drive as @tombradby @drewbrees Unlike any QB in the last 10 years IMO the #Browns finally got it right #BakerMayfield
Baker Mayfield is the prodigy of Drew Brees Mark my word I don‚Äôt know if he will get all the accomplishments as Drew has but he has that type of potential and that type of fight
RT @SenateGOP: Do you remember when @SenSchumer supported $46B in funding to secure our border? We do.	 	Now, he claims that $5B to keep Am‚Ä¶
@charliekirk11 Start it and I will give
@EdKrassen Lol dude you‚Äôre a tool and your book explains it. Lol.
@RealKyleMorris Well it only took him 3 years to realize that...
@donlemon u dnt think scientist sway&amp;disregard results tht deem not useful?they need grants If u produce no‚Äùresults‚Äù wil get none Thr is fake science as well as #FakeNewsCNN @CNN U care more bout CC than world hunger or ‚Äúwhite ppl R biggest threat‚ÄùI thought? @BarackObama says CC?
@adam_d_bell @EdKrassen Humans didn‚Äôt evolve with AC or heat we are built for that lol you are clueless. Tell me why people in 1 degree hotter states don‚Äôt die from this extreme heat on average 30 degree difference? It‚Äôs all a joke. It‚Äôs ridiculous science that‚Äôs hypothetical nonsense. Not worth my time
@adam_d_bell @EdKrassen Go knock yourself out with ways to back up your claims. Not worth my time debating a one degree change when you don‚Äôt get how a body easily can change for that. Or else people in Florida would be dying more than let‚Äôs say Minnesota bud.... way more than one degree hotter there..
@adam_d_bell @EdKrassen Do you know what a heat shock protein is? Lol our bodies can handle a one degree increase dude if you think that‚Äôs some catastrophic predicament and hunger isn‚Äôt, you should rethink your priorities. Adaptation isn‚Äôt evolution Bud.
@adam_d_bell @EdKrassen Things adapt to changes a one degree change...thermophiles live in 80C temperatures they didn‚Äôt just get there by random chance. Mutations. Trust me we can handle a one degree change buddy.
@adam_d_bell @EdKrassen That‚Äôs fine but that‚Äôs not unequivocally proven data it‚Äôs guessing. That like saying oh mars we will drill into and see... well let‚Äôs see what climate change they had then huh? You are worried about one degree change in hundred years. And not the issue of hunger causing death NOW
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump You literally are worried about climate change when there are people dying in 3rd world countries right now? There biggest fight is hunger not a degree change in nearly 150 years. It‚Äôs all republicans fault isnt it? But hunger abortion isn‚Äôt on ur agenda because talking points.
@EdKrassen you care about climate change killing people more than abortions? You care more about finding a single cell organism living on mars more than human baby lives. Don‚Äôt try2 tell us u care about 1 degree change in temp and it will kill humans? No @PPFA kills more #FACT.
@EdKrassen your book hasn‚Äôt even sold 2,000 copies which I promised donationswhat a joke Childrens book tryn2 make it indoctrinate kids who care about pizza &amp; if they will get candy @ tht age Not politics. Pretty sad the only ppl u could try2 influence are 10&amp; younger. Low life.
@EdKrassen How is it a fact when they only have a few hundred if even years of provable data and this type of trend has happened before? You have a control in science. You can‚Äôt have a two billion year control on earth. Did you look at Mars climate change?
@realDonaldTrump I find it illegal for them to use tax allegations and the like to basically bribe them into a less sentence...these had nothing to do with the ‚ÄúRussian collusion‚Äù they are using it because they know that manafort etc don‚Äôt want to spend years if not more in jail. They will coerce
@DonaldJTrumpJr or @EricTrump one of you need to run after your dad to keep this country going in the right direction #KeepAmericaSafe businesses are booming especially small business. #TrumpTrain. #Trump2020 #TrumpBros2024
@GartrellLinda @packer812 Not surprised.
@JosephNSanberg 2/2 I have student debt and I will pay it happily. I don‚Äôt cry about having to work my way thru stuff I don‚Äôt want handouts. U figure all that out. What are you gonna do? Pay everyone back that has ever went to college since the 1890s..that‚Äôs ‚Äúunfair‚Äù if u don‚Äôt.
@JosephNSanberg 1/2 No the problem is my generation feels entitled2 everything&amp; u can flip burgers for $15 in California but taxes makes that $9 there-I mean doesn't take a rocket scientist. They get degrees by reading textbooks &amp; have no real world experience y do u sympathize &amp; make excuses?
@JeffreyGuterman haha I deleted your tweet saying trumps racist after we pointed out @HillaryClinton actually said something herself and @realDonaldTrump never did you are a fluke joke counselor you need a shrink buddy
@JeffreyGuterman every shrink needs a shrink. I get it buddy. #hypocrite #jokeshrink
@JeffreyGuterman and @HillaryClinton said all black people look alike. So touch√©...
@pahubb43 They Dont get votes from those people so it's not worth there time and they Dont care about the people here they went to think they are saving the world by letting in people trampling the border. @Alyssa_Milano why haven't you given to the fires? I mean u have a ton of money?
@algore you are even more stupid than I thought. That's hard to do but pat on the back to you buddy. Y u not driving a #prius?
If you care about @UNFCCC @algore then why do you fly jets around the world have a mansion that puts off more emissions that 40 normal houses combined? Don't tell us what to do if you do completely the opposite ur a jackass
@AliciaMD66 @Stevegaston18 @nancy_hamm1 @luckymee22 And they shouldn‚Äôt because they are trying to be the parents
Y would people try2 storm the border when they can do it legally? Like this is what doesn‚Äôt make sense and @realDonaldTrump is right.pple do it the right way get pushed aside by #democrats they want these ppl2 cross they running out of voters with #blexit @RealCandaceO #Trump
@Espn you guys are pathetic having video game racing like honestly put those people in a real car without a damn handheld controller they wouldn‚Äôt beat my grandma in a Buick. You guys are doing more of a disservice to the entire world. Your ruining it
@kevinbhobart @Money23Green @KDTrey5 @StephenCurry30 @warriors I believe without curry that team would not make it to the finals wouldn‚Äôt have won. Not a chance.
@kevinbhobart @Money23Green @KDTrey5 @StephenCurry30 @warriors I think they still have that ring from the first year they together obviously inclusive of curry but of course any one person can make the diff, bulls wouldn‚Äôt have won 5 without #MJ23. Durant is a baller so if Klay but unlike lebron and MJ those teams couldn‚Äôt have done w/o
Anyone catch on @NBATV when @paulpierce34 asked @JalenRose @MichelleDBeadle about getting fired and she said something like you don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing under this desk? #ESPN #NBA Wthell was @MichelleDBeadle talking about? Lord have mercy
@kevinbhobart @Money23Green @KDTrey5 @StephenCurry30 @warriors #word
In the meantime the #Warriors are 12-7 and @Money23Green and @KDTrey5 still can‚Äôt decide what is going on apparently something isn‚Äôt right. Without @StephenCurry30 they ain‚Äôt gonna win... it‚Äôs that simple
@charliekirk11 #FACT. I don‚Äôt understand what their problem is wit doin it the legal way?they want drugs2 come in the ‚Äúlegal‚Äù way thru Mex2?both R against the law. Those tht hav legit claims would legally. y not?USA citizens to buy guns legally but any1 can enter the border &amp; do as they plz?
@EdKrassen You sound stupid and your book hasn‚Äôt even sold the 2,000 you were going to ‚Äúdonate the funds to‚Äù some thing that you forgot already... you‚Äôre a joke and everyone knows it man go take shirtless pics with your brother trying to promote ur kid book again u tool.
@EdKrassen Are u stupid? When @BarackObama drew the ‚Äúred line in the sand‚Äù for #Syria and they kill hundreds of their own citizens but now you want to politicize this? Where were you when Obama did not a damn thing for what he promised previous2that attack on civilians? #Hypocrisy #WalkAway
@APPSportsDesk excuse me, I got spanked as a kid as did all my friends. Jus b/c u want2 try &amp; parent every single kid lik u want to indoctrinate them teaching elementary kids (k-5th) transgender anatomy, that‚Äôs a parentin thng not ur decision. Stop tryn2 b parent of others kids.
How many liberal judges will try to block everything trump does? When 90% of it gets overturned and @MichaelAvenatti still owes @realDonaldTrump attorneys around a couple mil and he‚Äôs in bankruptcy $10 mil. And jail. What % of Obama‚Äôs got blocked? This is clearly political

@marklutchman You realize that dr ford and every other accuser now has gotten throw out... they now do not care about them? Where are they? Where are dr fords publications that got bleach washed from the internet about her ‚Äòself hypnosis to create artificial situations‚Äô.... weird huh?
@RonDeSantisFL @RepJNunez thank you guys for working so hard for Floridians! I look forward to taking a break from my #Nebraska life to fish in the inland of #Florida! #Redfish!
@LunaMay196 To making that decision or have the knowledge to then show me Wthell you have to back it up. You are doing a disservice to the people who need immediate help who didn‚Äôt create their own damn problem. Plus I said if u wnt2 make a diff bcom a damn doctor&amp; stop talking about it?
@LunaMay196 You‚Äôre the child, facts don‚Äôt care about your feelings, and all you care about are feelings, guess what, a liver in an ice box doesn‚Äôt care about an alcoholic 50 year olds feelings or an 8 year olds feelings, that‚Äôs the physicians call. If you think somehow now you are entitled
@LunaMay196 And then you walk into the doctors office and ask yourself the same question don‚Äôt you? You‚Äôre a Joke. If you want change, be the change. Hahha you have run out of comebacks of which had no scientific proof. So looking forward to you being a physician!
@LunaMay196 THEN DO SOMETHING STOP SITTING THERE! Stop trying to make other people fix your problems! BECOME A DOCTOR THEN IF YOU THINK U HAVE THE MAGIC BULLET! You ARENT DOING A DAMN THING TO SUPPORT YOUR IDEA! DO SOMETHING DONT DEMAND OTHERS DO!!!!!!!!
@LunaMay196 Like I said, facts do not care about your feelings. When doctors go under the knife, do they care about the patients feelings,? No u are not answering my question you are trying to make me out like I don‚Äôt care about people. I‚Äôm in this field you are not. Riddle me that?
@LunaMay196 Talk is cheap do it. Be a doctor then if u have this master plan that will economically work! Wow üòÆ!!!!!! Go do it!
@LunaMay196 Become a doctor for free stop talking and put your money where your mouth is. It‚Äôs all talk no action from you. I‚Äôm waiting. Tell me when you are accepted in MD when u are treating patients and doing it for free then I will say good job! You got what you wanted!
@LunaMay196 Respond to with facts not your shit ass UK healthcare that‚Äôs failed. Like I said y don‚Äôt u become a doctor please answer that! And please do it for free if not then why won‚Äôt you do it for free? Tell us all...
@LunaMay196 Is that why all of them come over here for school? Why almost half of their schools publications in medicine get rejected? You Do NOT do your research. You sound stupid. No other way to put
@LunaMay196 And if you want to pay $400,000 for undergrad and med school to get paid as much as a amazon sales employee, who only has $25,000 in debt, u connect that square. Go and do it then u keep talking? Why don‚Äôt you just go be a doctor for free? This issue you create shit healthcare
@LunaMay196 Look at how shitty that healthcare is... look at the UK healthcare. I‚Äôm not going to waste my time on something so obvious to people like me in this field. You can read it for yourself. All good practitioners are starting their own practices because the government is paying crap
@LunaMay196 U need to provide statistics you have no idea what you are talking about it‚Äôs completely apparent. You can sit in your bed while those people make decisions that you could never make. Later. I know what I‚Äôm talking about you don‚Äôt. See ya later! #MAGA
@LunaMay196 We all are waiting to hear your choice because this is a life changing decision that happens in hours so I‚Äôm updating your post real-time
@LunaMay196 So I gave you the cnhnacd to speak logically but you don‚Äôt know what a clinical trial is, you think we should give a liver to an alcoholic as much as we should an immunodeficient born kid. You don‚Äôt even know what that means but you can‚Äôt cut a liver in half make ur choice.
@LunaMay196 Because you provided no evidence to support your claims so now I want the public to see that you really have no basis to your argument.
@LunaMay196 Where does it end? Why do we spend so much money on science then if all those people deserve healthcare? So all the liberals who said smoking is bad for people was a waste? Like you tell me then since you seem to have a life altering proposition but know nothing about it
@LunaMay196 If U wer a drug dealer would you keep selling drugs2 someone who is killing themselves with those drugs? That‚Äôs the same damn question you need to ask yourself. You are clueless to this field obviously&amp;Ucan talk all you gotta any but you sound completely unprepared. Unintelligent
@LunaMay196 You don‚Äôt understand it‚Äôs a business you think people can just destroy their lives and we should treat them as if thyR on the same level as people who actually hv preexisting conditions genetically.u dnt kno wht u are talking about that‚Äôs not how this world turns,B a Dr. then.
@LunaMay196 You have no evicdmece to support your claims... you think some of the brightest minds in the world are going to go into healthcare to make a crap ass salary of healthcare is socialized? Guess what you will get? Surprise, shitty healthcare&amp;private practices tht good Drs. start
@LunaMay196 Then split a liver in half? Is that your solution? You are giving me no solution to what you want?
@LunaMay196 Not going to argue with someone who thinks an alcoholic 45 year old deserves a liver as much as an autoimmune diseases 8 year old. This is where your leftist argument fails so much it‚Äôs obvious. If you had to make that decision you sound like you would do a lottery pick. Unreal.
@LunaMay196 The kid lives&amp; alcoholic can deal w/it.no plethora of livers we can‚Äôt just cut out part of other livers; but the kid is the more deserving and if that man dies than that is what it is you need to be realist&amp;realize Drs dnt hav authority ovr ur ‚Äúsocial reasonin‚Äù He made tht choice
@LunaMay196 Well exactly, that doesn‚Äôt guarantee he lives then. U answered my damn question, thank you.
@LunaMay196 Facts do not care about your feelings; do you give the 8 YO kid who has failing liver because of an autoimmune disease the liver or the 45 year alcoholic that immunologically matches same liver for a transplant? How would u mak tht decision?it aint picks btwn a pink &amp; red skittle
@LunaMay196 So do you give the 8 year old kid whose liver is failing or the admitted alcoholic 45 year old that liver transplant? How would you make that call? Tell me plz
@LunaMay196 There is a reason for that, I‚Äôm glad to let you know. It‚Äôs a fine Line and I get that. It‚Äôs very hard to explain it‚Äôs a touchy subject. I have messaged you, you can gladly tell everyone what I say I just don‚Äôt want this character restriction number
@LunaMay196 And u know nothing about healthcare haven‚Äôt cited any sources to back any claims up so that‚Äôs why I know you‚Äôre just bullshitting. If you want to help them, then donate these people who smoke, money. Let me know, I‚Äôll be the first to congratulate you...
@LunaMay196 They know the damn risk you are acting lik u R smart u u ignore the ‚Äúscientific evidence‚Äù liberals like to tout u make no sense&amp;this is why ya people who actually understand and do this and push numbers and figure data out dismiss your shit. Facts don‚Äôt care about your feelings.
@LunaMay196 It‚Äôs called being a fucking person who owns up to their own shit. If I smoked a cigarette I‚Äôm not going to blame the cigarette forgive me cancer I‚Äôm gonna tell myself that it‚Äôs my fault. You are delusional. Who do we treat first?! People with lung cancer that smoked or didn‚Äôt?!
@LunaMay196 It‚Äôs not ruining their body in 99% of cases please give me resources I will refute them with scientific publications.
@LunaMay196 Are u a doctor? If u want to be a doctor and not make any money how will you feed your family? That‚Äôs one of the first question a med school interview committee will aka you. Because if you will do this for free you are not thinking logically. Why don‚Äôt u be a doctor4 free then?
@LunaMay196 &amp; what would you say if one of those parents smoked4ten years in the house&amp;car and their 7 year old kid got cancer? Is that the rest of the worlds fault too? Ur argument is based on no facts just complete bullshit for not taking responibility.u are liberal then believe science.
@LunaMay196 Live decent healthy lives? They chose to smoke their entire life not me!? That‚Äôs their problem not mine. Stop trying to blame your problems on everyone but yourself. Those people need to look in the mirror.
@LunaMay196 If I want to be republican and want $100 free dollars then can I get it from you? What the hell you have no basis lol you need to think before you speak
@LunaMay196 Why would I pay for someone who knows they are destroying their body? But you are okay when they make the decision to destroy a life that has no voice... abortion? Riddle me that. Please riddle me that. This is why this is a fucking joke. People like you.
@LunaMay196 Or is it the governments fault now?
@LunaMay196 Research before you talk or know anything.
@LunaMay196 Explain your Position and give me statistics to back it up why should we pay for people who make bad decisions that‚Äôs not my fault that is their fault are you in the healthcare business do you know what cancer is and how many types are is probably not so maybe u should do ur
@LunaMay196 That‚Äôs like saying If I walk into a pizza place I get a damn pizza no matter what their company or people say!? Are u serious?
I wish @MichaelAvenatti could respond2 my questions&amp; Y we believe his ex-wife but he is behind bars @KamalaHarris @WhoopiGoldberg now want due process, but not for #Kavanaugh. I thought ur motto was ‚Äúwe should always believe the woman‚Äù @maziehirono? Now no? Hypocrisy. Lying BS!
@RealCandaceO the @BLEXIT #BLexit movement is the scariest thing the #democrats #left #liberals have ever seen. Even more scary than they view @realDonaldTrump... dare to think different! Believe in your own madness! #MAGA #KAG #Usa #America! #KeepAmericaSafe!
If you are #proChoice, then are you pro choice for ppl that smoke and get lung cancer and then demand health insurance? That‚Äôs pro choice. These are grown ass people making their own decision when they know the consequences. That‚Äôs a joke. #WalkAway #BLexit
@KamalaHarris if you think #ICE is so worthless and ‚Äúequal to the KKK‚Äù then go down there and be one of them for a day...I guarantee the African Americans that are @ICEgov have a different word and story to pick with you. You are in a protected office get a field uniform on https://t.co/QL1YtJOAix
@DiamondandSilk @DebTarkon Thank you @DiamondandSilk !!!!
If anyone who is a democrat wants to call me an idiot for voting for @realDonaldTrump I will in return call u an idiot4 not understanding how ‚Äúdeplorables‚Äù dnt want socialism. And I will laugh, as @Madonna says ‚Äúblow up the @WhiteHouse‚Äùu tell me that #trump is divisive? Explain!?
It‚Äôs so disgusting how now the #left believes in due process that it‚Äôs a left man getting accused of domestic violence @MichaelAvenatti is a joke to humanity. And now he has due process 2 them? now you want to wait to hear the trial when #Kavanaugh you destroyed him immediately.
And apparently now, enforcing the law is against the law, and not enforcing it is praised upon? Florida, the county turned in 2 mins late?  @KamalaHarris u are disgusting if you think ‚Äúour @ICEgov is like the KKK‚Äù. This is divisive and if you don‚Äôt see that then I can‚Äôt help u
@KamalaHarris u compare @ICEgov to #KKK... are u kidding me? Do you understand what the hell they do? Does anyone else see how pathetic this is? This is why you have #BLexit, #WalkAway. @realDonaldTrump win win win #buildThatWall
Where are the people on the dr. Ford case, the Julia swetnick case, oh and the two women that came forward and now said they lied... and @MichaelAvenatti ends up in jail for domestic abuse? Where are u @CNNPolitics ?! Don‚Äôt you believe his wife @maziehirono @SenBlumenthal????!!!
Preexisting conditions should be decided on what DQs as PEC. Havin a condition arise from poor lifestyle choices. Ex: lung cancer aftr smkin 2pks/day 4 15yr DQ as PEC. Not debatable.WHO has told ppl it causes cancer yet they keep doin it. Genetic-caused disease shld b focus4 PECs
