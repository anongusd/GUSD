At my job I get to walk into many news rooms		It always astounds me how little to no representation there is of people of color in the stories, the covers of magazines &amp; the pictures in their offices, in a state where people of color make up the majority, it’s shameful
Cuz Maybe you will win back power for 1 election but if you don’t deliver real change &amp; fight for a radically different USA then the one where most Americans are forced to live pay 2 pay check without quality healthcare no retirement &amp; crumbling schools you won’t hold power long
5) and dems especially understand that they better be ready to take on Wall Street and the financial interests that have taken hold of both parties, 		Because.... #2020election
4) they need to understand that Americans aren’t just angry at the GOP they are angry at politics and economics as usual which has pushed people too far, made them suffer and they want real structural change
3) they need to understand that 70% of Americans don’t even have $1,000 in savings.
What dems running in 2020 need to understand is that Americans are suffering.		2) People want healthcare for every American and just reforming the system as is, is unacceptable #2020election
What dems running in 2020 need to understand is that Americans are suffering.		1) People are working doubletime, they can barely scrape enough cash together to make ends meet. They are tired and want real deep economic change. #2020election

Youth voter turnout matters, because by the next #Texas gubernatorial race in 2022 one in three voters in our state is going to be under the age of 30.		#JoltTheVote #VoterTurnout
Congratulations to everyone that worked so hard this election to get their friends, families and fellow #Texans out to vote.		We made history.		We saw nearly a 500% increase in youth voter turnout and our state is now purple. https://t.co/0qPBtq1J81
Most opinion pieces don’t reflect the diversity of our state or country and we need to change that.
First thing, it’s so important that women, people of color, immigrants, etc that reflect the diversity of #Texas be represented more in editorial pieces and op-eds.

The 47% wage gap for #Latinas persists even when you account for education and experience.		#LatinaEqualPayDay

More than half of all #Latinas are the primary breadwinner in their households.		It is an injustice to put in as much work as anyone else and get paid barely half.		#LatinaEqualPayDay

Today is the last day to register to vote in the state of #Texas. 		f you need help registering contact @JoltTexas .
So this election #GoVote. 		Let's take back our democracy by voting for candidates that are going to stand up for the American people and our interest.
But there is some good news, there are amazing candidates that are trying to change how politics is done across the country. 		People like @BetoORourke and @Ocasio2018 and thousands of others that are running and refusing to have their campaigns funded by big dollar donors.
They don't care if Americans have healthcare.	They don't care if our kids get to go to good schools.		All they care about is making more money.
This election the Koch brothers and their network are going to spend close to half a billion dollars to get their candidates elected.		They're going to spread lies and misinformation.		#Midterms2018
It's election time and while some people may think that our country has the most free and fair elections, and the best democracy in the world — they're wrong.		Right now our elections can be bought and funded by billionaires.		#MoneyOutOfPolitics #Midterms2018 https://t.co/yw1Fe7lgD3

The people in my community are those who most need the political system to work for them, and I know the current political leaders do not have their best interests at heart. That is why, this November we will vote them out. 	#JoltTheVote #WednesdayWisdom
The Latino vote has been restricted with redistricting and gerrymander to dilute my community's voice. Also with "voter fraud" prevention efforts that do more to suppress votes than promote democracy. #WednesdayWisdom #JoltTheVote

Dolores has taught so many of us that we are all leaders “People would say ‘Who is a leader?’ A leader is a person that does the work. It’s very simple. It’s a personal choice for people who choose to put in their time and commitment to do the work.” #DoloresHuerta
She stood up not just for farm workers, but the rights of the LGBTQ community and women’s rights before it was popular or safe to do so. She is in her 80’s and still organizing.
Dolores has been a fearless leader for our community, she organized not just as a Latina but as a woman and mother. People criticized her for spending more time in the streets than in the home with her family.
#FlashbackFriday to when Dolores Huerta came to Workers Defense Project, where I was the Executive Director, to give the keynote speech about the power of the #Latino community to change the country. This photo is from 2013 of myself, my Mom (Ana Tzintzun) and Dolores.

Hourly workers suffer the most job losses due to natural disasters. 		#ClimateChange #HurricaneFlorence		@yessfun 		https://t.co/R1M2beBTQK
Black and Brown people are the ones being most affected by #ClimateChange.		"A new survey has confirmed that Black and Latino residents, and those with lower incomes, reported the highest rates of property and income loss after Hurricane Harvey."		https://t.co/kcIz6iqGkH
#ClimateChange affects vulnerable populations in the U.S. and worldwide. 		"Previous hurricanes (like Hurricane Katrina) have shown that in America, people of color and low-income people have the hardest time bouncing back following a disaster." @yessfun 		https://t.co/2XajcBJFuY
Costly disasters are more and more common. We need elected officials who take #ClimateChange seriously. 		https://t.co/mypYbCKCLK
