@ClaraJeffery cool tip.
@InSpiteOfTrump @mikefarb1 It does when co allows screen scraping of data and dumps of other data. The misinformation campaign is only part of the problem. The real problem is business model - to sell data, users did not know info would be paired up w/voter stats. It is arguably nefarious. Think Equifax.
@mikefarb1 @InSpiteOfTrump Exactly. Always careful about posting things, purposely restricted friends, kept my private info as stripped down as required to have an account. I cannot say why I did these things -  I knew I was protecting people, I sensed something wrong about business model, left in 2016.
@eileen339 @Rschooley It just isn't the same w/out spats though...
@Rschooley his wife tweeting shit is not helping his case.	#LockHimUp
@InSpiteOfTrump @mikefarb1 So have I, and close to applications that drive business. We fully implemented GDPR like data protections for our U.S. customers despite it being separate platform, not required, costly to us. I would not work for company lacking integrity. I understand many employees are naive.

@Anidex @ClaudiaLamb @JTRhuntress @MollyJongFast @scottEweinberg @JennyMcCarthy I did not let adults near my babies w/o flu shots. When I found out staff at daycare was not required to have flu shots I freaked out and demanded they all get shots. And they did, because I literally asked every day.
@JTRhuntress @ClaudiaLamb @Anidex @MollyJongFast @scottEweinberg @JennyMcCarthy I'm so sorry, to be clear when I say the vaccinated should not have been exposed I mean the unvaccinated should not have been allowed to be in public spaces if they cannot abide by rules set by the public.  What happened to your mom was criminal negligence and I am so so sorry.

@SocialPowerOne1 When the fuck is she the mother? No offense, and I like working, but jesus, she's at home for photo ops then off to the next grift. If I was that (fake) wealthy, I would not be leaving young children at home all the time w/nanny. Then again... maybe this is better for them.
@ClaudiaLamb @Anidex @MollyJongFast @scottEweinberg @JennyMcCarthy They should all pay for the kids that were vaccinated though.
@MollyJongFast @JennyMcCarthy I remember the propaganda, I myself stalled vaccinating 1st kid w/MMR after a year (w/in range). At 1 yr checkup, pediatrician cornered me, said you going to do this today? I wavered, she pointed at my smiling animated baby &amp; said, does this look like a kid w/autism? Enough said.

@GuyLavender1 @Breaking911 The sovereignty of the U.S. is more than borders, how naive you are my man. The sovereignty is about national security, intelligence, attacks on our economy, on democracy, largest most insidious attack to date:  2016 election by multiple governments, but primarily russia.

I am confused about republican goals. They want the fast food jobs? They feel immigrants taking $10 hr jobs? Who is convincing republicans $10 jobs good? $10 not livable wage. Republican politicians do not support min. wage or unions.  Immigrants work $10 jobs AND they pay taxes.
@waltshaub republicans do not care about corruption unless they are not directly benefiting from it.
@cooldog95228 @marcorubio I knew the republican mindset is twisted, is anti-American, but I never saw so much hatred toward women and minorities as the past decade. This is some super sick shit I am seeing.

I love uncle Joe, I was worried another candidate could not beat trump due to misogyny but now I see any of our amazing #Democrats could win. I don't think Biden should try. 	https://t.co/WAKu5nojSl

Until my kids were in gradeschool, I demanded grandparents get flu shots, I questioned our preschool, badgered them until they changed policy to require all onsite workers get flu shots.
@PolitikMasFina What!!!!
@GaryLegum OMFG!!!
I was called a snowflake by someone who claimed to be a democrat (used lower case d). 	Pro tip to trolls: It's #Democrats (with upper case D) and if you're a bernie bro, you're not a #Democrat 	Pro tip #2 to trolls: We see your misogyny, disruptor tactics, we see fake #Democrats
