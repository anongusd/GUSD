“At the AMA, we will always be guided by two simple questions: 		What is best for our patients?		And how do we improve the clinical environment so that physicians have more time and better tools to serve their needs?”  — @CEO_AMA #AMAmtg
“The patient-physician relationship is the sun in our health care solar system. The place where problems must be identified and where we must focus our solutions.” — @CEO_AMA #AMAmtg https://t.co/fy691xYPj1
“In working toward solutions, we always have to start at the right place, the place where the larger truth about #healthcare exists.” — @CEO_AMA #AMAmtg
"In times of uncertainty, people look to the AMA to help chart a course through such dim light &amp; tangled circumstance...We can do so by striking the right balance between the urgent needs of physicians today, while taking steps to address the needs of tomorrow." —@CEO_AMA #AMAmtg
“Sooner or later, we are all patients, and patients need doctors. It is our job, our calling, and our mission to create a health care system that recognizes and supports the efforts of dedicated medical professionals.” 	 — @BarbaraMcAneny #AMAmtg
“#OurAMA stands for equality. Our Code of Ethics commits us to treat all patients — and one another — ethically and professionally. We’ve got this. We can do it.” — @BarbaraMcAneny #AMAmtg
"We must be able to intervene to address and improve the social determinants of health. That includes childhood traumas, which is why we protested the separation of children from their mothers at the border." -- @BarbaraMcAneny #AMAmtg
“Health care runs on our licenses, so we have the power to fix it. When doctors work together, for the good of patients, we are unstoppable.”  — @BarbaraMcAneny  #AMAmtg https://t.co/WR5Gs24pcW
“Too often the health care system gets in the way of actual health care.” — @BarbaraMcAneny #AMAmtg

“Now is the time for doctors -- armed with our Code of Ethics, the values of our profession, and the resources of organized medicine --to step up and create a system that is worthy of our patients and their trust!” 	— @BarbaraMcAneny #AMAmtg
“Most importantly, to change the system, our most valuable asset is the trust of our patients, and that trust must be earned every day.”	— @BarbaraMcAneny #AMAmtg
“We cannot assume that one system will work for every medical condition, every specialty, every culture or every community. ” — @BarbaraMcAneny #AMAmtg
“Some of the best lessons I’ve learned, that have guided me in my career, have come from my patients in their most vulnerable moments.”	— @BarbaraMcAneny #AMAmtg
“When physicians lead we care for people regardless of race, religion, economic status or sexual orientation, and we fight policies that treat immigrants or refugees in a manner that we would not tolerate for our own families.” — @BarbaraMcAneny #AMAmtg
“Health care already runs on our licenses,our knowledge and our expertise. We must make it run on our values as well! Because when physicians lead, we reject the politics and the policies that divide us. We speak out for patients. ” — @BarbaraMcAneny #AMAmtg
"We, the AMA, are committed to a more inclusive profession; one that includes new voices, new ideas, and new leaders at the table.”	— @BarbaraMcAneny #AMAmtg

“Thanks to organizations such as the AMA, as well as state and specialty societies, we have a voice. We have a platform from which we can lead on any issue – and work to re-align our health care system so that patients and physicians are back in the center! ” — @BarbaraMcAneny
“We have the most important ingredients in our hands.	We have our patients’ trust.	We have the will, the expertise, and the view of our system from its most crucial point – inside the exam room with patients. ”— @BarbaraMcAneny #AMAmtg
“We are medicine’s moral compass – and our strength lays in our collective expertise, our insights and our values. ” — @BarbaraMcAneny #AMAmtg

"Colleagues, we, America’s physicians, have the opportunity – but more than that, the responsibility – in coming days, to act on several resolutions that address this devastating crisis of our time." @drbabrb_md on the physician's role in the #gunviolence conversation
We thank the leaders on the #DACA issue in the Medical Student Section – people like Pratistha Koirala, Ruth Howe, and the people supporting them like Dr. Bob Goldberg--- for moving medicine forward. #AMAmtg #MembersMoveMedicine
“Led by the Medical Student Section, the AMA continues to pressure Congress to enact both short and long-term solutions for #DACA-status individuals in the medical community.” - @dbarbe_md #AMAmtg
Some of our members have DACA-status. During our I-16 #AMAmtg one member confided in another member their fears of being deported. @AMAmedstudents sprang into action--writing a resolution calling on us to take a staunch stand in support of health care pros with DACA-status.
“Research tells us that DACA-status individuals can help us alleviate physician shortages, especially in high-need areas, and provide culturally competent care.”- @dbarbe_md #AMAmtg
He developed a system that cut hospitalizations in half, reduced spending and improved patient satisfaction. Last year, PTAC recommended that Medicare test Dr Kosinski’s model. #MembersMoveMedicine #AMAmtg
Dr Kosinski found that hospitalization for the treatment of complications drove much of the excess cost and learned that less than 1/3 of patients who ended up in the hospital had any contact with their health provider 30 days later. #AMAmtg
Understandably, there is some fear and resistance, to moving to these new models. Thankfully there are members like Dr. Larry Kosinski, a gastroenterologist who has developed a specialty medical home for patients with Crohn’s disease, to show us the way. #MembersMoveMedicine
"We have worked diligently with CMS both to reduce physician burdens under the new law, and to create new physician-focused payment pathways...which reward physicians for their creativity in improving health care quality and reducing costs." - @dbarbe_md #AMAmtg
As IN health commissioner Dr. Adams fought for and implemented:	•Needle exchange programs	•Wider availability of naloxone	•Better access to evidence-based, comprehensive treatment	 	As Surgeon General, he also issued an advisory on Naloxone &amp; Opioid Abuse. #MembersMoveMedicine
"Addiction is a fierce adversary. No one understands this better than @JeromeAdamsMD, our @Surgeon_General, and AMA member, who has made fighting the opioid epidemic his top priority." - @dbarbe_md #AMAmtg
The #opioidcrisis is now the leading cause of death among Americans under 50. Due to the hard work of organizations – including our Opioid Task Force-- in recent years, we are making headway on several fronts. #AMAmtg

Don’t worry if you haven’t heard back! While handwritten letters are often more persuasive, due to security screenings, it may take weeks for an office to receive your letter and respond.
Pro Tip: Type your name and address at the end of the letter and sign above your contact information. This will eliminate any doubt about who you are and how to reach you.
Letters have more impact if they include personal stories and original thoughts. Join @PhysGrassroots to receive action alerts for specific issues to help you get the writing process started. https://t.co/3I6tgkN2Tx
