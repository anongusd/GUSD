A walk to a nearby park may give you more energy and inspiration in life than spending two hours in front of a screen.
Adversity draws men together and produces beauty and harmony in life's relationships, just as the cold of winter produces ice-flowers on the window-panes, which vanish with the warmth
Are you just "showing up" in your life or are you taking an active role in guiding it to reach your full potential and achieve your dreams? Jason Harvey
n doing things in life, it is essential that you know your achievements. This will considerably lift you up and get more motivated in working out towards your goal.
Instead of wasting time focusing on what we lack, let's focus on what we have and on the wonderful things we are able to do with the time we have been given
Do your best to surround yourself with people who inspire and help you, people who help you be the person you'd like to be. D. L. Hessop
Complaining may make you feel like you're doing something about the problem, but you're not, and it keeps you stuck pretending you might.
Our time here on Earth is a learning experience and no one is exempt
Everyday may not be a good day but there is good in every day
Words can inspire, thoughts can provoke, but only action truly brings you closer to your dreams.
Don't focus on regrets; find your inspiration in what you can do now.
Teachers inspire their student to be all that they can be
Think of how many other men and women of history there are that have overcome disabilities - looked them in the face, and denied the obstacles existence - and because of it have become inspirations to millions
Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement.	“Success is getting what you want, happiness is wanting what you get. 	“Doing the best at this moment puts you in the best place for the next moment
“Keep your sunny side up, keep yourself beautiful, and indulge yourself.	“I don’t think of all the misery but of the beauty that still remains.”	“If you don’t have any shadows you’re not in the light.”
The most effective way to do it, is to do it.	“I know for sure that what we dwell on is what we become.” — 	“If you’re not making mistakes, then you’re not making decisions.” 	“If you obey all the rules, you miss all the fun.”
Life shrinks or expands in proportion with one’s courage.	“It takes a great deal of courage to stand up to your enemies, but even more to stand up to your friends.”
“No one has ever become poor by giving
One’s life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others, by means of love, friendship, indignation and compassion
A woman is the full circle. Within her is the power to create, nurture and transform.

Memory is the mother of all wisdom. Aeschylus		Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers. Alfred Lord Tennyson		Don’t even try to become, just be. (Submitted by the Wisdom Quotes Community)
There is a universal, intelligent life force that exists within everyone and everything. It resides within each one of use as a deep wisdom, an inner knowing We can access this wonderful source of knowledge and wisdom through our intuition, an inner sense that tells us what feel
The gateways to wisdom and learning are always open, and more and more I am choosing to walk through them. Barriers, blocks, obstacles, and problems are personal teachers giving me the opportunity to move out of the past and into the Totality of Possibilities.
Pain and foolishness lead to great bliss and complete knowledge, for Eternal Wisdom created nothing under the sun in vain. Kahlil Gibran
Our concern in meditation is to know oneself, not only superficially, but the whole content of the inner, hidden consciousness. Without knowing all that and being free of its conditioning, you cannot possibly go beyond the mind’s limits. That is why the thought process must cease
First of all, to understand truth you must stand alone, entirely and wholly alone. No Master, no teacher, no guru, no system, no self-discipline will ever lift for you the veil which conceals wisdom. Wisdom is the understanding of enduring values and the living of those values.
Men who know themselves are no longer fools. They stand on the threshold of the door of wisdom. Havelock Ellis		Wisdom consists not so much in knowing what to do in the ultimate as knowing what to do next. Herbert Hoover
Man is wise and constantly in quest of more wisdom; but the ultimate wisdom, which deals with beginnings, remains locked in a seed. There it lies, the simplest fact of the universe and at the same time the one which calls forth faith rather than reason. Hal Borland
Reality – Dreams = Animal Being. Reality + Dreams = A Heart-Ache (usually called Idealism). Reality + Humor = Realism (also called Conservatism). Dreams – Humor = Fanaticism. Dreams + Humor = Fantasy. Reality + Dreams + Humor = Wisdom. Lin Yutang
Wisdom and understanding can only become the possession of individual men by travelling the old road of observation, attention, perseverance, and industry. Samuel Smiles
Wisdom is not finally tested in the schools. Wisdom cannot be passed from one having it to another not having it. Wisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own proof. Walt Whitman
Silence is the sleep that nourishes wisdom.
The most certain sign of wisdom is cheerfulness. 	Good judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad 	Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.
Everything comes in time to him who knows how to wait. 	A fool is known by his speech; and a wise man by silence	Never say no twice if you mean it. 	Wisdom ceases to be wisdom when it becomes too proud to weep, too grave to laugh, and too selfish to seek other than itself.
We can know only that we know nothing. And that is the highest degree of human wisdom. Leo Tolstoy		There is only a finger’s difference between a wise man and a fool. Diogenes		Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end.
Knowledge speaks, but wisdom listens. Jimi Hendrix Click to tweet		To attain knowledge, add things everyday. To attain wisdom, remove things every day. Lao Tzu
The fool wonders, the wise man asks. Benjamin Disraeli		Only the wisest and stupidest of men never change. Confucius		Where there is shouting, there is no true knowledge. Leonardo da Vinci		Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise. Benjamin Franklin
The best way to respond to Hatred is to trigger Love. The one who Loves is the Greatest
Faith in God is optional, but faith in the self – in the spirit within, is imperative
A butterfly does not return to a caterpillar after it is mature. We must learn to grow and evolve into a stronger, wiser and better version of ourselves. Life occurs in stages and taking a step at a time is key to learning and growing.
We may talk lightly but never carelessly. We keep at bay the flow of common, ignorant thought which runs its damaging course through the pathways of ordinary human conversation.
Bravery is the choice to show up and listen to another person, be it a loved one or perceived foe, even when it is uncomfortable, painful, or the last thing you want to do
You are born wild, You do not deserve to be tamed!		Tell yourself,		You do not deserve this!		All those toxic words you have to listen from people,		All those fears they try to pin on your mind,		All those giggles they aim at your dreams,		All those judgmental stares inspecting
thing. Be a woman of substance! Be a woman that both women and men respect, admire, and look up to Don’t disrespect yourself by lowering your standards and accepting just anything that comes your way. It’s okay to be single! If you want a relationship of substance, you can’t keep
“Women Empowerment Reminder of The Day. Always respect yourself as a woman. You attract what you are, so be very mindful of how you’re representing yourself. If you want respect, you must first learn how to respect yourself, first. Attracting negative attention is never a good
You push the TRUTH off a cliff, but it will always fly. You can submerge the TRUTH under water, but it will not drown. You can place the TRUTH in the fire, but it will survive. You can bury the TRUTH beneath the ground, but it will arise. TRUTH always prevails!”
Your life is a movie. You are the main character. You say your scripts and act to your lines. Of course you do your lines in each scene. There is a hidden camera and a director who you can ask for help anytime up above
The only way to get what you want is to make them more afraid of you than they are of each other
There isn't any questioning the fact that some people enter your life, at the exact point of need, want or desire - it's sometimes a coincendence and most times fate, but whatever it is, I am certain it came to make me smile.”
Socrates: Have you noticed on our journey how often the citizens of this new land remind each other it is a free country? 	Plato: I have, and think it odd they do this.	Socrates: How so, Plato
I think, that if the world were a bit more like ComicCon, it would be a better place
I like to listen. I have learned a great deal from listening carefully. Most people never listen
