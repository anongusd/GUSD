#Equalpay is not just a women’s issue, but a financial issue as well. It impacts our families, businesses, &amp; economy. It's unacceptable that in Iowa, women are still earning 77 cents for every $1 paid to male counterparts. #EqualPayDay
Unfortunately, the @EPA joined Big Oil at the expense of Iowans' clean air &amp; pocketbooks. When fully in place, Clean Car Standards saves consumers $50 bil &amp; creates 650,000 jobs. Rolling them back is another example of the Admin siding with special interests over Iowa's interests
