@HynesSockGame yes it does, I wasn't saying that the gatekeepers have complete and total control
@THEBrookeRead but aren't TV reporters retelling what they're reading on a teleprompter?
@HynesSockGame editors, owners of news corporations, the government, etc.
@meganfire to some extent, but I would say the biggest diff. is the level of responsibility; journalism is a career, sharing is an instance
@alexgracetaylor @meganfire well yeah they also have a responsibility to be honest... #credibilityoutthewindow
@HynesSockGame I don't know if I would say news is dictated by the general public, there are certainly still gatekeepers on higher levels
@meganfire I would say reporters are authorities and good ones strive to figure out and comment on how a certain thing affects the world
@Tyler_Eddinger @cad13c @alexgracetaylor it's also a matter of trust and credibility

@Kme13Kylie @bmichaels1004 @alexgracetaylor I would rather get my news from The Daily Show anyway
Is any news "real news?" #boom #mindblown #noonecanrespond #fsumkwepo
@sam_may5 @Corinne692 I would say the same, and they are authorities in the news world
@PeterStrobis @Kme13Kylie that's why tabloids exist (which should be considered fiction by the way)
@PeterStrobis @Kme13Kylie Yeah I definitely think celebrity news should be kept off major news stations

@atresselewm I use Twitter to read jokes written by middle-aged dads
@atresselewm but I do use fb to see what my friends &amp; family are doing (mostly uninteresting things) #FSUMKWEPO
As an introvert, I enjoy time by myself so social communities on the Internet don't really appeal to me #FSUMKWEPO
@atresselewm yeah this totally sounds sexist
Studies show that females tend to use the Internet for social-based reasons, while males' reasons are more information-based #FSUMKWEPO

@atresselewm medium*
New media do not appear out of thin air #alwaysevolving #FSUMKWEPO
Movies will never be better than books #booksrule #FSUMKWEPO
There are always mult. definitions #FSUMKWEPO
determining whether a media is old or new depends on audience among many other things, like most things in this class #FSUMKWEPO
new media: media that is unnatural in the sense that people have yet to be used to it; not yet routine #FSUMKWEPO
old media: media that is not widely used and/or considered out-of-date #FSUMKWEPO

I didn't talk about audience at all, idk what's wrong with you guys #FSUMKWEPO
@alexandraloreee this term has a lot of different definitions, so you maybe won't be able to come to just one conclusion #FSUMKWEPO
Rhetoric: art of effective or persuasive speaking/writing, esp. the use of figures of speech and other compositional techniques #FSUMKWEPO
Twitter = genres within a genre #genreception #FSUMKWEPO
@amcginn13 Ok I can see that, so the question is when/where is the genre constructed and how? #FSUMKWEPO
@AngeloMEspinoz1 @Tyler_Eddinger Yeah, those in which everyone participates #FSUMKWEPO
@madisonpenico @Tyler_Eddinger @PeterStrobis That's exactly what I wrote in my journal #preach #FSUMKWEPO
Are we to use the dictionary def, of genre or are we going to try to reconstruct it, bc that is always very complicated #FSUMKWEPO
I can't get all my thoughts out in 140 characters #frustrating #FSUMKWEPO
@Tyler_Eddinger @PeterStrobis Well yes, simply because we have just read an article with a def. of genre diff. from the norm #FSUMKWEPO
@sam_may5 Yes, situational is my favorite word in this class #FSUMKWEPO
@sydneymschaefer I think the writer just has an effect in mind when writing something, like making the audience laugh, cry, etc. #FSUMKWEPO
@PeterStrobis That is true, and I would also argue that the author almost always has a genre in mind when they begin writing #FSUMKWEPO
@rachelepstein11 Yeah, what is a genre anyway? #needanswers #FSUMKWEPO
@sam_may5 But can the meaning be determined effectively? #FSUMKWEPO
@PeterStrobis All of them? I think a genre is something so general it should be able to be a consensus #FSUMKWEPO
Does genre stem from meaning, or does the opposite make more sense? #FSUMKWEPO
RT @LaurenLV12: I never thought of #genre as something that could constrict a writer. Hmm.. #FSUMKWEPO
Context is also imp when looking at writing, and we must consider the writer's frame of mind at the time of publication #FSUMKWEPO

If you guys need more examples of logos, Aristotle is actually on twitter and can give you some knowledge @dailyenthymeme #FSUMKWEPO
Canons of rhetoric: 1. invention 2. memory 3. style 4. arrangement 5. delivery and the lost 6th canon - Pachelbel's #jokes #FSUMKWEPO
Is it delivery or is it Digiorno? #jokes #FSUMKWEPO
Your writing can wear business cas if you are just speaking with coworkers #style #FSUMKWEPO
Style: dress up your writing in big floppy hats to get your audience's attention #FSUMKWEPO
Is invention only at the brainstorming stage or can it happen in development? #FSUMKWEPO
@atresselewm Members must have same ideas #FSUMKWEPO

@Kme13Kylie or could we work together through discourse to find the most probable truth? #Aristotle #FSUMKWEPO
@Corinne692 @meganfire only logos? #FSUMKWEPO
Does anyone else think it's funny that we're perfectly comfortable making points &amp; refuting them thru tweets but not face 2 face? #FSUMKWEPO
I think a situation is different from an exigence; not all situations present a problem that needs to be solved #FSUMKWEPO
@rachelepstein11 @meganfire but doesn't the audience depend on the situation? #whichcamefirstthechickenortheegg #FSUMKWEPO
@LaurenLV12 @meganfire I agree that it starts with a situation, but Bitzer would say that it doesn't need to demand a response #FSUMKWEPO
@meganfire I agree more with Vatz's theory bc everyone is likely to interpret a certain situation in a slightly different way #FSUMKWEPO
@meganfire Bitzer focuses on the situation as having inherent meaning, Vatz focuses on perspective to define a situation #FSUMKWEPO
The Digital Studio will tell you how to use the technology machines for your project #FSUMKWEPO
Project 1: define a key term of rhetoric in broader terms providing research on origin &amp; present it in some form of print #FSUMKWEPO
Vatz: rhetoric derives from perspective #FSUMKWEPO
Bitzer: rhetoric derives from the situation #FSUMKWEPO
Appeals can be used alone or together #FSUMKWEPO
Rhetoric doesn't have to be verbal #FSUMKWEPO
