McDonald named all tourney team - Holland II named tourney MVP for @nkunorsembb @ENQSports
Great scene as @nkunorsembb players jump into student section.
Final @nkunorsembb 59-53. Headed to #marchmadness My vote was Holland II for MVP. Trophy presentation now then cutting the nets.
That ought to do it. Several missed @mkepanther 3s and Holland gets ball and will shoot FT with 2.9 left with 4 pt lead.
That's big FT from Holland. Makes it 2 possession game. Misses second.
And it's McDonald with huge post up over bigger defender for @nkunorsembb. @MKEPanthers answer but fouls begin. Holland for 1-and-1.
I'll say one thing @nkuedu fans showed up and are LOUD. Nice atmosphere. #MotorCityMadness
Big 3 by @MKEPanthers cuts lead in half. Someone dove too much on drive for @nkunorsembb Timeout NKU, 1 left. Who gets call here? @ENQSports
Two huge FT from Garnett pushes lead to 6 for @nkunorsembb with 1:30. I think @mkepanthers out of timeouts. @ENQSports
Interesting offensive foul call there on Holland on break. But @nkunorsembb block Stull's three. Norse look gassed, but Garnett gets to line
Another Williams turnover. @MKEPanthers have ball down 4. But miss 3 on inbounds play. McDonald can't answer with open 3 for @nkunorsembb
Holland misses first, hits second for a 6 pt lead for @nkunorsembb with 3:45 left.
McDonald notches double double with 12 pts and 12 boards. Holland carrying team right now tho - headed to line could put @nkunorsembb up 7
Holland draws foul on fader in lane off nice set play. Two more FT after TV timeout. @nkunorsembb leads 51-46 with 3:50 left.
Holland drives and dishes to Williams, who gets foul and just misses 3pt play opportunity. Big FT here - misses first, hits 2nd. 5 pt lead.
Bad possession there out of TO for @nkunorsembb - Holland misses bail 3. Lead down to 4 with 5 mins. Williams answers inside. @ENQSports
Timeout @nkunorsembb after a missed bunny by @MKEPanthers - the Norse need better offensive flow here. Holland is carrying them one on one.
McDonald with HUGE stop there against taller opponent but misses 3. Still 6 pt lead for @nkunorsembb
Stuhl with another bucket after rare @mkepanthers off rebound. Still 4 point lead for @nkunorsembb after Panther turnover. Holland hits.
Call stands - turnover for @mkepanthers. @nkunorsembb  ball with 4 point lead and 9 minutes left. Holland with nice dish to cutting Garnett
Big call right here. If call stands, lead stays at 4 for @nkunorsembb if not, its down to 2 points with 9:27 left.
Game tightens up on nice dish and dunk by @MKEPanthers  and Murray 3 pt miss. Only 4 pt lead. Called a 30 second violation but under review
Heat check 3 misses for Holland but Williams gets foul on hustle rebound play. @nkunorsembb 44-38 at 10:47 TV timeout. @ENQSports
.@MKEPanthers Barnes comes off bench for 3, but Holland answers. He's been clutch this game. Lead back to 6 for @nkunorsembb
Holland only gets few mins breather. But @mkepanthers miss both FT and lead stays 4 until Holland hits big floater in lane for @nkunorsembb
Again bench not playing well. Offense slows down for @nkunorsembb and give up a dunk backcup. Lead back to 4 with @mkepanthers at line.
.@nkunorsembb suffocating D right now but Williams with turnover on careless pass. TV timeout - NKU leads 39-33 with 14:25 left. @enqsports
Wow. @mkepanthers get bucket with 3 left on shot clock after great D from @nkunorsembb and Murray misses layup.
Murray with three on good rotation from Holland. @nkunorsembb go up 39-31 and force timeout. Players getting crowd involved. @enqsports
McDonald can't buy a bucket right now. @MKEPanthers can tie or lead here but miss  Another rebound and McDonald hits 3. 36-31 @nkunorsembb
Two stops off the bat for @nkunorsembb and a Williams hustle follow bucket. But @MKEPanthers get a possible 3pt play from Stuhl, 2 pt game.
Not a lot of fouls called. @nkunorsembb with 4-2 edge from the line. NKU also 3-11 from deep - needs to change in 2nd half for Norse to win.
Box score is here. Key stats @NKUNorseMBB outrebounded @MKEPanthers 21-14 including a 8-3 edge on off glass. Couldn't convert those though.
.@NKUNorseMBB lead 31-28 at half despite dominating most of way. Game really slowed down in last 5-8 minutes. Holland has 11 to lead Norse.
Williams with play of night for @nkunorsembb Stuffs the drive, gets ball and throws off player.. But @mkepanthers w/putback at buzzer. 31-28
Brannen tells @nkunorsembb bench "offense is stagnant" - McDonald misses another 3. Chance for @mkepanthers to cut lead to 2 or three here.
McDonald going cold all of a sudden mini push by @mkepanthers leads to @NKUNorseMBB timeout. Up 5 with 1:13 left in half.
Great passing set for @nkunorsembb pushes lead to 9 with Williams finding Garnett cutting through lane. 31-22 2 mins left @ENQSports
But .@NKUNorseMBB outrebounding @MKEPanthers 20-8 at this point. That has given them this lead. 29-22 with 4 mins left tin half and NKU ball
Game has slowed down considerably. @NKUNorseMBB usually win when score more than 70 - it's a push whether they make that here. @ENQSports
Big call there. Faulkner follows own 3pt miss and appears to get three point play, but called a charge. Lead stays at 7 for @NKUNorseMBB
Two misses there for @NKUNorseMBB but get ball out of bounds. And set play opens up McDonald who now has 9. Lead is 7 and NKU gets TO.
Holland II with trey after @mkepanthers go zone. Nice passing. Draws another foul and can push lead to 7 for @nkunorsemnbb  after TV timeout
Starters back in. First time bench didn't play well in tournament for @nkunorsembb. @MKEPanthers claw back to 2 back. @enqsports
First off rebound for @mkepanthers cuts lead to 4. Milwaukee tightening up on D too. Back to line could cut lead to 2.
Faulkner TO leads to @MKEPanthers 3 pointer. Faulkner answers but score tightens up. McDonald with good post D there for @nkunorsembb
if I was playing, I would NOT want to be guarded by Garrett from @NKUNorseMBB - another off rebound and putback 20-11 NKU leads.
.@NKUNorseMBB shooting 57% right now. More subs for Norse.
Second wave or players in for @nkunorsembb - Murray hits DEEP 3 out of timeout. Will that wake him up?16-9 NKU lead. @ENQSports
McDonald already with 7 points early on. @nkunorsembb also dominating boards - one and done for @MKEPanthers
McDonald flying hook shot pushes lead to 9. Brannen telling @nkunorsembb to keep uptempo. 13-7 at TV TO tnx to bailout 3 by @MKEPanthers
Holland II with nasty crossover and tipback own miss 11-4 @nkunorsembb 5 minutes in. @ENQSports

.@NKUNorseMBB get stop on first possession Brannen yells "great defense" to bench. But @MKEPanthers score first. 2-2 now.
ESPN has @nkunorsembb favored  by 6 over @MKEPanthers FWIW. Crowd into it behind press row.
.@NKUNorseMBB fan crowd even bigger now. Almost filled lower half side of the lower bowl. MUCH bigger crowd than before. @enquirer

@jdgaby @RaeHodge @loueyville Agreed. But could it be campaign issue? If someone found out opponent had account? What then?

Vladimir Guerrero voted MVP had 3 HR (I think). No official box score that I see anywhere. Not that it matters. But it was fun. #asg
And that's it AL 25-21. But @snoopdogg is MVP on entertainment value alone. #asg
So much for booing ... @andydalton14 cranks another homer and flips bat. All cheers now. #asg scre is 25-21.
Anyone else here at stadium? How bad was booing for @andydalton14 ? It sounded pretty bad to me at first. #asg
If NL celebs want to win, now's the time. Down 3 runs in bottom of sixth and last inning. #asg
Bedlam erupts. Everyone surrounds home plate ump who stands by his safe call. Appeared @snoopdog ticked @RobRiggle on the hand going by #asg

That;s one way @andydalton14 can get the crowd behind him ... one of longest HR of the night. AL still leads 19-14 #asg
Rain descends as NL pitcher brushes back Vladimir after last HR, no difference. He smacks it even further despite @SnoopDogg jump fence #asg
