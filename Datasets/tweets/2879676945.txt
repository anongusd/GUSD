@DanaCarlson8577 The bill is not even going to pass, by the way.  Pelosi's anger was about vote discipline (which she is legendary for enforcing); AOC has no business threatening a primary (talking about "lists" is an implicit threat).
@DanaCarlson8577 Yes.  And Pelosi gave them a verbal dress-down.  It's not the AOC's job to threaten them.		This is a learning moment for them to vote 'no' on MTR procedures.  Still, AOC is not in any position to even talk about primarying people in a meeting.

@Marksw1968 @bungarsargon All of that isn't about LEGAL/ILLEGAL... It's about the demographic change that racist GOP voters in rural White America hate.
@Marksw1968 @bungarsargon In the context of the GOP's rural White Southern base, talking about "ILLEGALS" is really a talk about how America is getting too brown for the racists' liking.		He blasted Europe a year ago when he was in London with some racist cultural talk about immigrants and refugees.
@Marksw1968 @bungarsargon Refugees are LEGAL.  And Trump signed an Executive Order against LEGAL immigrants from 7 countries on his 10th day.		He also revoked TPS for people from Haiti and Liberia.		And he used DACA as a bargaining chip to slash family and DVL visas.		ALL OF THAT IS LEGAL IMMIGRATION.

This is too idiotic!  I can't believe I'm debating with you the necessity of context.
@Marksw1968 @bungarsargon Really?  Don't you understand the difference between a bulls*it act and a PATTERN of actions and statements?		The guy started his campaign as a BIRTHER  who called Mexicans "rapists".  A year ago he failed to denounce Nazis and campaigned in support of Conf. statues.		F*ck off!
@Marksw1968 @bungarsargon You're the one mentioned him and I told you he endorsed Trump.  Your rebuttal is a "what about".		Yeah the ones associated with gangs can't really get visas.  But why should we deport freaking babysitters and crop pickers?		Also, Trump is slashing and attacking LEGAL immigration.
@beanie_3072 @BarbaraTholfsen @AngryBlackLady Two things that you should understand, and it's not really hard: context and hindsight.		But now we have Twitter so every idiot with access to Wikipedia is a pundit.
@beanie_3072 @BarbaraTholfsen @AngryBlackLady That's also out of context... Good God it's so ignorant to put things from the 1990's in the context of today's world.

@RickwithFlair @ChrisLoesch @metsygirl203 @Newsweek Sure!  People in Austin would rather live in King County üò∑ where the Evangelical priest claims primae noctis over female residents.		This upside-down world where colleges are uneducated and religious hillbillies are is so out of whack.
@redco2012 @RickwithFlair @ChrisLoesch @metsygirl203 @Newsweek Also, literally none of what you said about college towns is true.		But if you hate knowledge, it‚Äôs natural to think of your uneducated Evangelical White hillbilly constituencies as the educated ones while academics and people who deal with facts and science as ‚Äúbrainwashed‚Äù.
@redco2012 @RickwithFlair @ChrisLoesch @metsygirl203 @Newsweek Funny you‚Äôre putting the picture of Lincoln on your profile, a man who stood up against bigoted Southerners and stood up against the Know-Nothing Party (the anti-immigration party).

So, what if Amazon went to these towns and brought change and flood of investment and opportunity?
@PPDQTRHRS @Newsweek His point was that once people see ‚Äúothers‚Äù, they become less susceptible to Trump‚Äôs fear-mongering about immigrants, Muslims, etc...		A person in Souther Indiana who nodded along with Trump in 2016 has probably never met a Muslim or a Mexican in their life.		(Cont.)

@_Fruhmann_ @patr1ckw @Newsweek Is Medicaid expanded in Texas yet?  Or do fast food workers still need to go to the emergency room?
@adam_hamby @patr1ckw @Newsweek False!  And devoid of context!		People are migrating from the Northeast and Midwest (red and blue) to the South and to the Weat as part of an old migration pattern.		That small piece of land in Rhode Island still has almost double the amount of people in Wyoming.
@patr1ckw @Newsweek Nope!  Not really!		The Northeast and the Midwest are losing people to the South and West; as part of a natual migration pattern.  		But they‚Äôre not going to Mississippi or Wyoming.  They‚Äôre going to Denver, Austin, San Diego, ...

@Manning_Eric @NJCathi @shelgunns @Erulin @HillaryClinton This is still the issue we are debating.  (Attached).		Yet you are fact-checking clear and obvious hyperbole instead, after I gave you clear examples of GOP policies not helping people. https://t.co/GHuKt4hpCu
@Manning_Eric @NJCathi @shelgunns @Erulin @HillaryClinton No it‚Äôs not remotely similar.		Republicans in state legislatures can expand Medicaid at virtually no cost to their gov.  It‚Äôs cost-effective and insures plenty of poor people.		So the cost-benefit analysis clearly says: DON‚ÄôT LET POOR PEOPLE DIE TO SAVE MINIMAL AMOUNT OF DOLLARS!
@Manning_Eric @NJCathi @shelgunns @Erulin @HillaryClinton I have 280 characters limit you moron.  The idea is still clearly communicated.  Medicaid Expansion makes sense for these states yet they are refusing to do it for ideological reasons, not monetary.		That‚Äôs a policy that doesn‚Äôt help people at all.  Just a faulty ideology!
@Manning_Eric @NJCathi @shelgunns @Erulin @HillaryClinton I have no idea what you‚Äôre arguing about.		You wanted examples of Republican policies that don‚Äôt help people and I told you.  Medicaid expansion is footed by the federal government.  The reason they‚Äôre not expanding is ideological, not monetary.
@Manning_Eric @NJCathi @shelgunns @Erulin @HillaryClinton I said it costs nothing compared to the benefits. That‚Äôs clearly what I meant, you moron. The reason they didnt expand is ideology and nothing else.		One of the leaders of Wisonsin‚Äôs gerrymandered legislature said: we‚Äôre not creating one more program to get people hooked on govt.

@Manning_Eric @NJCathi @shelgunns @Erulin @HillaryClinton I didn‚Äôt say that.		It‚Äôs a cost-benefit analysis.  And the Medicaid Expansion is the most cost-effective way to help people.  And it does cost nothing to the states compred to the benefits.		So, to say ‚Äúname one policy‚Äù then balk at insuring poor people at minimal cost is stupid.
@Manning_Eric @NJCathi @shelgunns @Erulin @HillaryClinton And I‚Äôm done here!  You can‚Äôt say ‚Äúname one policy‚Äù as if you are standing up for the poor and then say ‚Äúit‚Äôs costly‚Äù without even looking up the fact that it costs virtually nothing to the states except the hardcore ideology of these legislators.
@Manning_Eric @NJCathi @shelgunns @Erulin @HillaryClinton That was my point you nimrod!  They are givinng tax cuts to the wealthy and large corps while poor people can use that money to have healthcare.		So, you started this when you said ‚Äúname one policy‚Äù.  I told you about the Medicaid expansion which costs dimes to the states.
@Manning_Eric @NJCathi @shelgunns @Erulin @HillaryClinton Republicans have let CHIP lapse for the first time in 10 years you moron.  Likely to use it as a bargaining chip before they extended it.		And yes, not expanding Medicaid is a policy that is hurting people for no reason because it virtually costs nothing to the states.

@MayaraFavarao @HillaryClinton @DrLeanaWen Assuming I take your argument for personhood, in modern civil state, does that mean census workers should go check women's bellies?  Should pregnant women go to jail for riding horses or bicycles?		Also, when does a conceived egg's personhood becomes as valuable as the mother's?

@AlexAnotherOne @AndrewSolender p.s. I also mildly support our intervention in Vietnam, and I want us to do more for Ukraine.  This is my consistent worldview.  Kind of like McCain in way that I believe that we are humanity's last hope, and we should our position wisely and justly.
@AlexAnotherOne @AndrewSolender I am consistent in my views about us being an enforcer of peace. And I want Palestanians (and everyone else) to have the right for self-determination.		And this is my last tweet on this subject... would my criticism of Israel upset you if it was consistent with my worldview?(3/3)
@AlexAnotherOne @AndrewSolender But to me, this is purely foreign policy.  I am consistently pro-human rights, pro-international law, and I have also supported previous interventions in the Balkans, in Iraq, and I also wish Obama intervened in Syria. (2/3)
@AlexAnotherOne @AndrewSolender Okay.  I understand that.  I can't be in your shoed but I can only imagine how hard it is to be Jewish today with rising anti-semitic attacks.  You absolutely have every tight to be uncomfortable with certain things and I appreciate that; I truly do!
