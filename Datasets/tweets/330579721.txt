@Stryder6969 I don’t doubt US military capabilities. I’m skeptical of the threat posed by a caravan of bedraggled people walking en masse to the border.
@Stryder6969 My skepticism is that we need to  rush 5k-15k troops to the border to lay concertina wire for a threat that’s 40 days away and according to most news accounts doesn’t appear to be a dire threat.
@Stryder6969 Agree. It’s your duty to follow lawful orders and borders matter. The ? is whether sending 5K-15K troops who can’t detain ppl and are doing a job already covered by others makes sense. Soldiers should follow orders. Civilians in a democracy should debate those orders robustly.
Even soldiers are murky on border mission:  “They  are careful in answering questions about how many soldiers live there, how long exactly they’ll remain or what they’ll be doing. At least 2 disagreed about whether it was even a deployment” @danlamothe https://t.co/rz4G5Avwr4

@rbbrown76 I'm a big believer that we are our own worst enemy when it comes to Russian interference. They exploit our weaknesses and divisions and pettiness. The best defense is to heal ourselves -- though we've shown little capacity to do it.
@rbbrown76 I'd argue it changed things in a manner analogous to the 9/11 attacks (though not nearly to the same extent). There was an arrogance about our invulnerability. In both cases that was punctured.
One of my favorite things every year:These photographs are World Press Photo winners https://t.co/dY8reS0fxD
@rbbrown76 But it's also true that the Russians didn't brazenly launch attacks on our Democratic system prior to 2016. So I guess the argument is that changed the nature of the competition.
