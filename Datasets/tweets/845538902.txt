@jimmy_dore @MWBoJr Hey Jimmy the media is corrupt to right? I think it would be in our best interest to have the govt control all media including your podcast problem solved. Works in China right?
@PaulieG09 @jimmy_dore @aliveforthenite The insanity is giving the power to fix it to the most corrupt government in US history our government was never designed to solve issues it was designed to protect our right to solve them ourselves.

Missed an entire year of my life in HS. Fighting to get another MRI after the first was inconclusive. Ruptured a disc 2 yrs ago with a std...
@IncipientShine @aliveforthenite @jimmy_dore You just proved the point.m since the ACA act insurance costs have skyrocketed as the market has become less competitive and the govt sets prices. The money has just moved to more profitable markets.
@aliveforthenite @IncipientShine @jimmy_dore Economics. Jimmy is a comedian and journalist.  But his mathematics are definitely coming into question.  Maybe if he understood the effects of price floors &amp; price ceilings on supply &amp; demand he could grasp what ‚Äúinefficiency‚Äù means
@jimmy_dore @aliveforthenite Efficiently then MAYBE then I‚Äôll believe government healthcare has a chance. But as long as our FDA remains corrupt I‚Äôll still trust the broken system now more then I‚Äôll ever trust more govt.	The definition of insanity is to do the same thing again &amp; expect a different result
@jimmy_dore @aliveforthenite You are comparing countries with populations less then California &amp; less corporate corruption. If you can end corporate lobbyists and return the power back to the people by guaranteeing voting rights for all removing Super Delegates &amp; tomorrow the government runs smooth and ....
@2antsi @TulsiGabbard We do for the most part more then most other countries.  Doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt do more but other countries are far worse then what we can even imagine.
@jimmy_dore We can‚Äôt even get the FDA to legalize marijuana for medical purposes that it‚Äôs proven to help with due to corporate lobbyists like Bayer/Montesano stopping it &amp; you think they will keep your best interest in mind??
@jimmy_dore Don‚Äôt be that liberal asshole that turns to insults when I ask a valid question that opposes an opinion you have that‚Äôs based on stupidity. You constantly trash our govt then you think they should decide how to handle our medical care?  That‚Äôs sounds like a special kind of stupid
No I think that Medicare for all means the government, HO can‚Äôt even pave a fucking road properly, now controls our heathcare and all aspects of it.  Deciding on treatments etc. You know we fight for profit wars for oil, wait until the govt makes profit on medical treatment https://t.co/3n6IXciv8W

@SenSanders How about we eliminate ‚Äútaxes‚Äù (theft) period and remove useless idiots like you?
@SpeakerPelosi Did you know		Nancy Pelosi has been in Congress for 28yrs with an annual salary of $193,400		So how is her net worth nearly $200,000,000?		Even if she invested 100% of her salary and paid 0 taxes for 3 decades, with 10% ROI, she should only be worth $30,000,000 at most #Corrup
@SenSanders Economics 100:  when a supply and demand curve in a market (this case would be the labor market) has the prices artificially moved from its equilibrium you create a market inefficiency.  In this case if you raise minimum wage the demand for employment at that price would drop

@JackDonovan76 @thomasatimcik @TulsiGabbard @budweiserusa There is also zero motivation for research &amp; development of natural cures such as using Amino Acids to treat disease, b/c they can‚Äôt be patented as sold for insane profits. I‚Äôm not sure how to answer those problems. Regulation I think does as much damage as lack of at times

@JackDonovan76 @thomasatimcik @TulsiGabbard @budweiserusa So it‚Äôs only one OxyContin company?  What about the generics?
@JackDonovan76 @thomasatimcik @TulsiGabbard @budweiserusa I totally believe your stance works in a legislative government that is free from corporate lobbyists funding.  It‚Äôs easier to educate each other through social interaction today to inform each other of the dangers of their products. Stopping them by not buying their poison.
@JackDonovan76 @thomasatimcik @TulsiGabbard @budweiserusa But when the banks stole billions &amp; their corrupt predatory loans failed bankrupting folks by over inflating property values our corrupt government bailed them our with our taxes thus giving the property back to the banks to sell again for profit.  Another fail...

@JackDonovan76 @thomasatimcik @TulsiGabbard @budweiserusa I agree all these companies should have to provide honest answers.  However the way to stop them from killing us is to not buy their products.  When there is no profit in killing us they will stop.

@Second_Captain @SenSanders But they won‚Äôt.... (sighs) unless your bill includes campaign finance reform that eliminates corporate donors from sponsoring congressmen nothing will ever change. A business that doesn‚Äôt have to turn a profit to survive or control costs will never survive.
@kelliump @estee_nj @JeffFlake @ChrisCoons Another stimulus to aid in reducing carbon emissions that would spur innovation would be an increase in income taxe mileage deductions say 25¬¢-50¬¢/mile increase would incentivize commuters, outside sales reps and companies to buy electric vehicles
@JanMilkovich1 @JeffFlake @ChrisCoons That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important for the educated public that understands economics and how taxes effect supply and demand and how reducing taxes in markets we aim to stimulate is the most effective solution.
@kelliump @estee_nj @JeffFlake @ChrisCoons Less taxes = lower cost = increase increase in demand = increase in supply; the truth is big oil lobbyists will never allow this. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏
@kelliump @estee_nj @JeffFlake @ChrisCoons If you could claim an income tax deduction for 50% of the cost of an electric vehicle you would significantly increase sales, which in turn would incentivize the auto mfg industry to innovate the market, not only lowering cost but also to increasing product selection. Less taxes
@kelliump @estee_nj @JeffFlake @ChrisCoons For example I‚Äôd buy a $50k Tesla over my Chevy Impala if I paid zero sales tax and no taxes on the $20k difference that I used to buy a more efficient vehicle.
@kelliump @estee_nj @JeffFlake @ChrisCoons It doesn‚Äôt require spending it requires tax breaks, deductions on income for money spent on renewable energy is all it would take.
@JeffFlake @ChuckGrassley @SenatorDurbin @SenMikeLee @SenBooker End the for profit privatization of our prisons.  Stop the for profit drug wars.
@kelliump @JeffFlake @ChrisCoons https://t.co/TanQCSniVl
@estee_nj @kelliump @JeffFlake @ChrisCoons Artificially inflating the costs with ya won‚Äôt spur innovation, it will push capitalistic shareholder driven corporations to move to markets that are less regulated, like China, that now have surplus of oil supply due to the US market lack of consumption.
@estee_nj @kelliump @JeffFlake @ChrisCoons Then subsidizing the competition, Renewable energy, would be a more effective way of adjusting for pollution and spurring innovation and technology.  You want to tax anything?  Tax plastic and our disposable non recycling society.
@kelliump @JeffFlake @ChrisCoons Man it sucks when people use mathematics to to prove your ignorance.
@kelliump @JeffFlake @ChrisCoons A better solution would be to stop the US off shore oil drilling that Obama administration past, endbtge for profit oil wars in the Middle East that have increased the supply oil supply thus deflating the price and raising consumption.  https://t.co/qsDR4PlB1b
@kelliump @JeffFlake @ChrisCoons So what you are saying is ypu want to artificially alter the supply and demand curve to create a market inefficiency?  Or you don‚Äôt understand basic microeconomics?
@SenSanders Medicare for all is a disastrous idea.  The government can‚Äôt even decide if Trump is a Russian spy or not after 2 years and you want us to trust you to provide us the best possible healthcare?  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@JeffFlake @ChrisCoons Why do we need a ‚ÄúTAX‚Äù to fund clean energy and reduce carbon emissions? How about we introduce a funding bill or a ‚ÄúTAX CREDIT‚Äù for solar, wind and hydro power to consumers at any level who use the free market to innovate and create better ways.

@JenBriney Figured you‚Äôd have the bill@read and broken down before I‚Äôd get to it lol
@MikeTrout @Bharper3407 @Phillies  let‚Äôs go!! Come to Philly and create the greatest baseball dynasty ever!!  Would be one BADASS 1-5! 1)@TheCUTCH22 2) @Jeansegura02 3)@MikeTrout 4)@rhyshoskins 5)@Bharper3407  who wants to pitch to that??!? #LetsGoPhillies https://t.co/1uyRsZm1rK

@WIPMorningShow Bad refs remain consistent. Defense played good enough to win.  Offense didn‚Äôt control the tempo or the momentum.  Too many 3 n outs.  Time to put work in and get better.
@Eagles Also I‚Äôm a Fan FOR LIFE. üíöü¶Ö #FlyEaglesFly my heart remains broken this morning but my hopes for a return to greatness remains bright #AllWeGotAllWeNeed @cj_wentz criticism doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôve lost faith in you.  We are proud and blessed to have you in Green.  You will play better
@Eagles Accountability.  Who‚Äôs not making the plays.  Starts with coaching then works downhill.	#NoExcuses #PlayBetter #DoYourJob
@MahonoftheHour @amazingatheist Yes I do, it would mean the government takes 90% of what you own and produce and distributes it evenly to the people that don‚Äôt do anything.  Have fun destroying our country.  You sound like a talking point for Communism.
@BaldyNFL @Eagles Gotta give respect to @ZERTZ_86 right there getting a hat on the DT and giving up his Ass to the RB #LoveTheTrenches #TrenchWarfare

@CigreteButtes @BaldyNFL @PatrickMahomes5 @tkelce I‚Äôm ok with it, LOVE watching him play.  That team is exciting to watch!
@BaldyNFL @PatrickMahomes5 @tkelce Tough throws horrible mechanics, how long do@you think he can keep it up?? I sure hope a long time cause I love watching him play. As an Eagles fan it‚Äôs also exciting to see what Andy Reid can be with an accurate QB and not McNabb....
@AdamSchefter Lets go Kap get off your knees for once!
@BaldyNFL @Eagles @DarrenSproles @ZERTZ_86 and that Block by Jason Kelce!!! Got me so@excited I wanted to put pads on again step flat turn@hard around the edge and go looking for some flap-jacks!! Someone get Kelce a Pancake sticker!! üíöü¶Ö #FlyEaglesFly
Maybe he‚Äôs afraid of injury?
@BaldyNFL PLEASE, please breakdown @cj_wentz pre-snap reads and progressions.  He‚Äôs just not the same QB this season.  Everyone blaming the Peterson‚Äôs calls but to me unless the ayndesign works perfectly Carson hasn‚Äôt been able to improvise like last year.
@roughChin @BaldyNFL @Giants @scottysimes83 Watch him on film.  He breaks contain often and I‚Äôve seen him on his back a bunch this season.  He‚Äôs a dominate player, no doubt, but his run defense is avg.  but since it‚Äôs a passing game today it‚Äôs not noticed.  I‚Äôd still want him on my team.
@MikeClayNFL A lot of people see the weapons watch the TV broadcast but not the coaches film.  Wentz is not reading defenses at all this season.  At the line or progressions.  Locked on to his main target and trying to squeeze the ball into tight windows.
Also don‚Äôt understand your support for @SenSanders; if he‚Äôs for us the poor gadolinium how did he get to be a millionaire on a senate salary?  He‚Äôs just as corrupt as the rest.  @TulsiPress @TulsiGabbard needs to be our new leader! #Gabbard2020
@jimmy_dore hey Jimmy I‚Äôm a huge fan and love your podcast. Thanks to @joerogan for introducing you.  But I don‚Äôt understand your stance on Medi-care for all.  You tell me the govt is doesn‚Äôt work but then you want me to trust them to run my healthcare effectively???

@BaldyNFL @Giants @scottysimes83 Anytime you get a Mark Bavaro reference I get excited.  But run defense isn‚Äôt Mack‚Äôs game

@fantasy4sports @Tommy_Enright17 @PHLEaglesNation Darby fills quickly on off tackle runs.  He doesn‚Äôt shy from contact.  His hips and his turn along with his ball skills are far superior to Mills and Rasul.  We seen all we need to see from Rasul. I dare you to ask @BaldyNFL for a break down of @rd32_era play, he‚Äôs not a starter
@fantasy4sports @Tommy_Enright17 @PHLEaglesNation So from your couch you know more then the coaches right?  Bet you still think Rowe should be on the roster ü§®. Mills lacks closing speed but is a tough defender and player great field control pushing receivers into help and away from the play.  Darby has amazing closing speed and
@L3vidicu5 @PHLEaglesNation Oh I was thinking you spelled Lane‚Äôs name wrong lol
@fantasy4sports @PHLEaglesNation You know zero about football when you speak Rasul‚Äôs name as underrated.  He‚Äôs got slow hips, no closing speed, sub par ball skills and can‚Äôt press.  What game have you wat he‚Äôs were he did ANYTHING but get burnt?  Opposing QB‚Äôs throw at him every chance in Man coverage.  Not good
@L3vidicu5 @PHLEaglesNation Who‚Äôs Johnston?
@PHLEaglesNation #Underrated is @fcoxx_91 he‚Äôs paid but respect has been missing from@the fans.  Between him and @MalcolmJenkins they are keeping the team going #Overrated is @cj_wentz the tools are there, he‚Äôs missing reads and locked on 1WR, he has 5 studs in the passing game plus a good oline
@BaldyNFL @Saints Noticing that lean though by the guard on the last play, as a D lineman and LB you gotta see that and expect the trap.  Telegraphed it and they still couldn‚Äôt stop it üò≥

@DonnaLynnNH Education is already free if you EARN IT.  Also 50% of people in college are wasting valuable resources. You don‚Äôt need a college education to own a business, build homes, run machines, etc.  these jobs pay very well and require tech school not college we need career training
@DonnaLynnNH 1) the minimum wage should be determined by market value.  Anything else upsets proven economics 2) Medicare for all doesn‚Äôt work, would you like a customer telling you how much they are paying and how much you get to make? 3) the wars need to stop no doubt 4) no free college

@JenBriney @jimmy_dore interesting read: https://t.co/ewgg7pgf7N
@JenBriney And I‚Äôm not trying to sound mean.  I‚Äôm far from an Ivy League and only 37 but 10+ yrs in corporate America &amp; 8yrs in small business plus 2	Degrees have taught me enough to know bull shit when I see it.  Her interviews are tough to watch how the republicans didn‚Äôt win there is ü§Ø
@JenBriney She seems scary intelligent and she‚Äôs representing many people.
@TulsiPress @POTUS Awesome!!
@SenSanders I‚Äôm trying to understand your endgame here.  Is your goal to eliminate monopolies?  Why are you trying to limit people‚Äôs potential?  That‚Äôs taking away freedom.  Are you against that?  Why not try and unify their labor force (I‚Äôm against unions) but that seems a better way
@JenBriney It‚Äôs like Ocasio-Cortez.  If you have an economics degree, which I have 2, you would present a much better understanding of the economy then she does.  Everyone is excited about her being elected but she sounds uneducated and unqualified to represent others.
@JenBriney @TulsiGabbard No I don‚Äôt think you are pushing hate or division.  Cause I follow you.  I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs who you are.  But when you specifically mentioned it, it caught my attention.  Everything in corporate media spun the same narrative.  No one takes about the platforms they ran on.
@JenBriney I think we both agree we should just be out of it.  It‚Äôs a religious war that we got involved in for oil
@JenBriney @TulsiGabbard No I listen regularly, that‚Äôs why it was the first time I questioned you.  For the first time I heard the corporate media narrative coming from you.  So I said my peace.  I grew up where racism didn‚Äôt exist.  Only to to find that society has tried to program me to hate.
@JenBriney Does this matter when the GOP can just shoot it down?
@treasonstickers I‚Äôm attacking @NancyPelosi because she‚Äôs corrupt to the core.  Soo corrupt@even the boys can see it
@JenBriney I can agree with that.  Though I believe we need to fix our problems before we take on the ills of others...
@JenBriney @TulsiGabbard Because she represents your values, she‚Äôs against corporate lobbyists and the war machine.  Because she‚Äôs a veteran who seen it first hand and understands what our country is against.  The fact she happens to be a woman means nothing politically.  She can do the job that matters
@JenBriney It‚Äôs not worth mentioning.  People are people.  If you want to stop division and stereotyping, you can‚Äôt divide people.  Point out their political platforms and their campaign promises.  Its like saying vote for Hilary because she is a woman.  Tell me vote for @TulsiGabbard
@TulsiGabbard @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @SenSanders @CoryBooker @SenBooker where is the democratic leadership on this?  Afraid of loosing campaign funding for next election!!??  #FixIt #Gabbard2020
@hqbinders @davidhogg111 @esme_hornbeam That‚Äôs why you got your ASSES handed to you in WW1, WW2 &amp; the Revolutionary War üá∫üá∏
@NancyPelosi Will you cover the voter fraud and recounts in CA and FL?  Why don‚Äôt you pass voter registration laws that require an ID system that tracks the votes?  Like our credit credit cards use to track our purchases?  It‚Äôs 2018 we are trying land on Mars &amp; we can‚Äôt even run an election?
The day we don‚Äôt allow them to divide and conquer us begins when we stop referring to fellow citizens by the same racial groups they divide us into.  ‚ÄúALL (hu)men are created equal...‚Äù
You begin to sound like the liberal corrupt corporate media that feeds up propaganda of change while it‚Äôs funded by the same corporations you stand against.
You should judge ones character by their actions and the platform they run on.  I‚Äôm the midterm election episode you failed to mention any of the platforms that the new hopefuls ran on.  Instead we‚Äôre here 1st BLACK female, first ISRAELI etc.
@JenBriney I appreciate your work and opinions, but keep in mind; when you refer to politicians by referencing their ethnicity, sex, religious affiliation or sexual orientation you weaken your message.  The melatonin content of their skin has zer to do with their ability to lead
@JenBriney A few?  I only see one. @TulsiGabbard  she‚Äôs seems to be the real deal.  Looked in my local election and I got stuck between career sellouts and inexperienced idiots.  The media has soo many brainwashed...  what‚Äôs really important?  We can‚Äôt even vote without corruption
Removing constitutional rights like attacks on our 2nd amendment, policing free speech on social media attacking our 1st amendment, dividing us by the melatonin content of our skin and shoving liberal political correctness down our throats.
@JenBriney finally got to listen to your Midterm episode.  What I gather is supporting the current Democratic Party is useless- instead of fighting for what really matters like ending corporate lobbyists, stopping big banks, preserving the environment they all ran on platforms of

@alienghic @HouseSBCDems @DQYDJHQ @njdotcom ya no shit
@alienghic @HouseSBCDems @DQYDJHQ that‚Äôs the point if I made $500k &amp; lost half I could live.  Lot harder when you make $50k-100
@alienghic @HouseSBCDems we do spend more on military than anyone.  Taxes should be paid on expenses not incomes and military is 50%/bug
@alienghic @HouseSBCDems @DQYDJHQ if you add up my taxes paid at end of the year not including sales I‚Äôm over 50%. And roads are &lt; wars
@alienghic @HouseSBCDems and my argument was that federal income tax could be abolished or lowered since 50% of it goes to fight war
@alienghic @HouseSBCDems @DQYDJHQ owning a home used to be the hallmark@of@the middle class which sadly no longer exists
@alienghic @HouseSBCDems so having a mortgage is being well off?? I don‚Äôt think so.  Owning a house loan Free is well off
@alienghic @HouseSBCDems @DQYDJHQ what in the useless graph are you trying to use to justify your argument? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
@alienghic @HouseSBCDems not GDP.  Your data is a joke
@alienghic @HouseSBCDems find me the chart that shows all the taxes the avg home owning us citizens pays and add them up compared to income
@alienghic @HouseSBCDems income tax combined with, school, property, local, state, sales all witch amount to far more then your graph shows
@alienghic @HouseSBCDems you‚Äôre joking right?  All the countries on that graph don‚Äôt add up to@our population.  And I‚Äôm talking income tax
