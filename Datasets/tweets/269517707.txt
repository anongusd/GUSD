@HectorSolon The reality is kids are currently being denied an education especially the underprivileged.
@HectorSolon Kids are important. That is precisely why #SchoolChoice is so vital. If kids were the priority, #SchoolChoice would be norm.
@HectorSolon So what is your reason for failing schools currently? Govt is running them now. Car companies would provide safety w/out regs.
@HectorSolon If parents control resources and can leave, new schools will form in those areas if the schools are failing.
@HectorSolon Empowers them even more because they can find alternatives that the rich currently only can find.
@HectorSolon Parents can also choose public schools. That option is not excluded or eliminated. Choice gives power to the people.
@HectorSolon More importantly, I trust parents to choose schools that are successful and have power/option to leave schools that aren't.
@HectorSolon Unless of course you prefer experts made all of our decisions. I prefer important ones to be made by those impacted most.
@HectorSolon People are hardly experts in many of products, services they buy but are able to w/out govt. Are you an auto expert? Own a car?
@HectorSolon Doesn't change the fact that wrong people are in control of resources when it comes to education. Should be parents, not pols.
@HectorSolon Mich. Constitution currently prohibits #schoolchoice solution. It also doesn't mean that all school succeed. Just good ones.
@HectorSolon I'm talking about what Friedman advocated for in 1950s or Dr. Fuller in Milwaukee. http://t.co/EfXmCvnFev @SmithBrianA
@HectorSolon I'd favor a universal tax credit or voucher to parents to select school.  @SmithBrianA
@HectorSolon But bad teachers don't go. Parents don't have choices in education that we do at grocery stores. @SmithBrianA
@HectorSolon @SmithBrianA Concern should be over what's best for students, not protecting an institution. Bad schools should fail. Period.

@MotorCityLib I read your articles. You dismiss mine. I ask questions. You refuse to respond beyond a link or insult. Disappointing.
@MotorCityLib I read your articles. I asked if it were legal because they don't cite the actual bill, which doesn't have delay provisions.
@MotorCityLib You called me a racist and white supremacist.
@MotorCityLib I'm not outraged. I'm disappointed. You've insulted me numerous times and have no respect for a civil debate.
@MotorCityLib If the law allows them to postpone, then cite the law. That's a pesky fact.
@MotorCityLib This article says that it is baseless to say that it is political to postpone implementation. Your previous articles disagree.
@MotorCityLib Being illegal isn't a talking point and it certainly isn't good government.
@MotorCityLib As far a recycling, you sent me articles recycling liberal ideas. I ask questions. You don't answer.
@MotorCityLib I have read the articles you shared and ask questions regarding them. You respond by insulting me.
@MotorCityLib The article does not point to where the bill allows the delay just that the Admin. is allowing it, but they cannot legally.
@MotorCityLib PPACA does not give Treasury the ability to delay mandate or fines. It is to start on 1/1/2014, not sometime in 2014.
@MotorCityLib Are you supportive of the President's admin. breaking the law to delay its implementation?
@MotorCityLib The Obama Admin. has had more than 4 years (length of an undergraduate degree) to listen to businesses and simplify forms.
@MotorCityLib Deflecting... No answer to the red tape question?
@MotorCityLib What red tape are they having difficulty getting rid of and why wasn't this included in the bill?
@MotorCityLib Unless you are now conceding that the law has some real issues and that's the cause of the delay?
@MotorCityLib Why play politics &amp; delay it then? People would see how the law works and benefits them. It wouldn't matter what GOP said.
@MotorCityLib Setting your comments aside, real debate is uncertainty that #ACA is causing and now more so that it's being delayed. Agree?
@MotorCityLib My logic was as sound as yours. :)
@AaronConey Are you in L.A. now!? I definitely need to subscribe to your updates on Facebook. Also, what did you think of #ManofSteel??
@MotorCityLib Using your logic... One sign of racists: all people who oppose Obama are white, tea partiers, and/or white supremacists.
Openly called a racist for attending a tea party today by @MotorCityLib. My black friends will certainly be surprised. @AaronConey
.@MotorCityLib I've attended tea party meetings and am white. Does that make me racist? And I thought the left was tolerant and open-minded.
By delaying implementation of his own health care law, @BarackObama called 'genius' by the Left. Yes, you read that correctly... #repealACA

@bloggingformich the same to you. A Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. Talk soon.
@bloggingformich then there should be plenty of victims filing from that side.
@bloggingformich no the damage was over $40k and the insurance rate went up due to the claim from the damage
@bloggingformich also you should be able to find someone to file charges against them.
@bloggingformich @afpmichigan called for investigating the entire situation. If guilty as you say, then it will be easy to convict them.
@bloggingformich Proving my point. "pay me" ... no one wants monetary compensation just the situation investigated as it should be.
@bloggingformich See what you want; defend what you will. Even my liberal uncle was appalled by the behavior and condemned it.
@bloggingformich @AFPMichigan &amp; many others got assaulted by people who refuse to allow others their first amendment rights; you defend them
@bloggingformich Those are starts and stops from recording. My friend filmed that and put them all in one file.
@bloggingformich the business that owns them does $40,000 worth of damage and insurance rates went up as a result
@bloggingformich VIDEO http://t.co/bxQr35LQ Union person says that union protesters are taking down the tent. Get to 1:24
@bloggingformich The woman in the video seen removing the straps was heckling me in the front of the tent. She is an MEA member.
@bloggingformich VIDEO: union protesters flip tables, women &amp; supporters leaving tent, one is using a walker http://t.co/PpAgQFfu
@bloggingformich No one encouraged people to go inside while it was falling. We left when threaten &amp; rushed. Supporters didn't loosen ropes.
@bloggingformich @AFPMichigan reserved the Capitol steps &amp; space for tents. Free speech &amp; assembly does not equal culpability.
@bloggingformich @AFPMichigan &amp; supporters wanted #RTW passed. That's why we were there. Exercising 1st Amendment rights which were violated
@bloggingformich Several people were trapped under the tent including many women. These are facts, not whining.
@bloggingformich They destroyed the heater and the propane tank that was supplying it was damaged and found several miles away.

@MotorCityLib Again, speaking for me is unwelcome. My viewpoints are clear and I don't defend either party for their big spending.
@MotorCityLib What is being shot down is future growth and prosperity because of the debt. #fact
@MotorCityLib Debt. as % of GDP: 2000 = 57.7%; 2004 = 64%; 2008 = 74.1%; 2009 = 86.4%; 2010 = 95.1%; 2011 = 98.7%; 6/30/2012 = 101.7%
@MotorCityLib Your chart in your blog is a % of GDP. Real deficit values are higher than any time past. Again, Bush was a hefty spender too.
@MotorCityLib How do you prevent income inequality? Is income your measure of success?
@MotorCityLib The cause of debt is spending. Just like buying a house or purchases on a credit card. Spending causes debt.
@MotorCityLib Worked meaning what? Explain. #Vague.
@MotorCityLib Spending adds to the debt. People keeping more of their money doesn't. Spending our money adds to the debt.
@MotorCityLib Your generalizations are incorrect and naive. I don't defend adding to the debt by either party.
@MotorCityLib you are making the assumption that I did/didn't support these items. Regardless, the problem is spending, not tax cuts.
@MotorCityLib I didn't know that I endorsed a candidate. There are other options for voting besides Romney and Obama.
@MotorCityLib Didn't know that I supported the 2 wars or increased debt by Bush and Obama. You're putting words in my mouth. #fail

@jimmy_galvez follow me &amp; direct message me your address. Been good discussing things. We both want the same things. Approach differently.
@jimmy_galvez I had an economics prof in college that wrote The Politically Incorrect Guide to Capitalism. I will buy and mail you a copy.
@jimmy_galvez :) debate is good. I was/still am in same situation as you. Unhappy/frustrated w/ my status. I just don't want govt choosing
@jimmy_galvez we can make more things here if companies were allowed to create w/out govt intervention. That costs money and slows growth
@jimmy_galvez all symptoms of too much gov't deciding what can and can't be produced and using our money to pay for their projects
@jimmy_galvez not a thing wrong w/ that. But eliminating choice isn't good. Also govt can't just increase wages an living standards. Not god
@jimmy_galvez where you buy is your choice. the idea that $ staying here helps workers is nonsense; it hurts you the consumer by paying more
@jimmy_galvez the cheaper goods are made and the more options there are helps working families and the poor as well as everyone else
@jimmy_galvez I buy what I see as valuable, want and need. I don't care where from because people are people and competition is good.
@jimmy_galvez makes sense to buy what product you value &amp; want regardless of where. Cheaper goods are good. But choice is more important.
@jimmy_galvez do you buy things outside of the city you live in? If outsourcing is bad, why buy outside of Florida or your hometown?
@jimmy_galvez where you buy and how much you pay is up to you. Cheaper goods help the poor and working class.
@jimmy_galvez do you buy products outside of FL?
@jimmy_galvez does trickle down from govt doesn't work? Govt isn't benevolent.
@jimmy_galvez ok w/ big businesses as long as they aren't given special breaks or regs that keep others from competing. That hurts workers
@jimmy_galvez I'm frustrated w/ how much I'm paid. The alternative of gov't running our lives is worse. Freedom &amp; voluntary exchange is good
@jimmy_galvez where are you from, Jimmy? Just curious. I live in MI.
@jimmy_galvez austerity is a myth in Europe. Google myth of austerity in Europe. Dan Mitchell's article is great. Second link I believe.
@jimmy_galvez subsidies in all industries should be eliminated. Distorts the real market prices of goods and services. No picking winners.
@jimmy_galvez jobs are about adding value to the business. If more value is added, then raises &amp; more jobs can be created.
@jimmy_galvez gov't exploits people by having too much debt, too much spending, and messing with value of the dollar through printing money
@jimmy_galvez there'd be more jobs if gov't wasn't managing the economy. Reduce spending, cut taxes &amp; eliminate reductions, stop subsidies
@jimmy_galvez job creators don't exploit workers! Workers have the choice to go from job to job. It's called voluntary exchange.
@jimmy_galvez those too. I wasn't neglecting them. Bailouts are unacceptable.
@jimmy_galvez They are telling me where to invest. I pay federal taxes and the federal debt is loaned from my future income.
@jimmy_galvez govt investments like Solyndra, Solaris, GM, Chrysler, to name a few have all lost $. Successful companies don't need tax $
@jimmy_galvez R&amp;D happens w/out taxpayer $. Investors' jobs are to find projects to invest. I prefer investments are my decision not govts
@jimmy_galvez GOP guilty of promoting green subsidies also. They fail because they must be subsidized to be made. Eliminate energy subsidies
@lioncallie if wind and other green energy is so profitable, then it doesn't need subsidies or tax breaks. Eliminate all breaks for energy.

@Watchdogsniffer What about trade between states that have less taxes than others or different regulations?
@Watchdogsniffer Do you think companies that are surrounded by communities look at the environment when the produce goods/services?

@MotorCityLib But that is cronyism and not true economic freedom.
@MotorCityLib I would also agree that both political parties allow the "rich" to have more loopholes than the middle and poor classes.
@MotorCityLib the bottom 10% in countries with more econ freedom are 8x richer than the richest 10% in other countries http://t.co/zTN4bpwK
@MotorCityLib More goes into job creation than just taxes so the article assumptions are limited. If tax rates don't matter, why not 100%?
@MotorCityLib That doesn't mean that I am opposed to a safety net, which many liberals assume incorrectly.
@MotorCityLib I prefer as much wealth to be in the hands of those that earn it so they can best decide how to spend it.
@MotorCityLib I think we can both agree that economic growth is important. I think we disagree at how wealth is created though.
@MotorCityLib I think it is important to defend all people wealthy to poor the same. The wealthy do pay a huge portion of taxes already.
@MotorCityLib I would disagree with the millionaire statement because I believe that wealth is the individuals and not the government's.
@MotorCityLib I would agree that the defense budget can be cut.
@MotorCityLib I was referring to in general (outside of the Ryan budget) what it is that you dislike about free markets and capitalism
@MotorCityLib One real problem is the length that it takes before the budget goes back down. Definitely takes too long in my opinion.
@MotorCityLib Not sure why supporting a type of reform that isn't exact isn't possible. If a better solution existed, I'd support it.
@MotorCityLib it also slows the growth of gov't as opposed to a faster rate cutting $5.3 trillion over 10 years
@MotorCityLib I would agree that it isn't the exact plan that I would like to see happen, but it does cut spending by $187 billion initially
@MotorCityLib "AFP certainly does not believe this budget is a perfect proposal nor does it include many reforms that are urgently needed."
@MotorCityLib What parts specifically related to economics do you disagree with?
@MotorCityLib Considering alternative points of view allows debate and discussion. One-sided as you are, limits you. Too bad.
@MotorCityLib I question all sources whether they be right, left, non-partisan or partisan. I look for the facts and make conclusions.
@MotorCityLib I'm willing to read your sources &amp; discuss them the ideas/merit. Not interested in extending the same courtesy?

@MotorCityLib I thought nothing of the sort. I wanted to learn more about what you supported and why.
@MotorCityLib In order to both understand why we support/oppose various things it is helpful to know the basics. Agree? Then no assumptions.
@MotorCityLib I don't mind discussing the pros and cons of the Ryan budget or a liberal one if there actually was one.
@MotorCityLib Wanting to know what you think the role of gov't should be as a whole is not changing the subject.
@motorcitylib What is your expectation of the role of gov't?
@MotorCityLib The Ryan plan is in no way perfect. It adds debt and doesn't reform nearly as much as I would prefer. I don't disagree.
@MotorCityLib I haven't even responded to your facts yet because you have yet to actually tell me that you agree that the debt is a problem
@MotorCityLib I was actually looking forward to a civil discussion on issues and role of gov't. Disappointed. Very un-ninja of you. :P
@MotorCityLib Please also note that I am now speaking in my personal opinion. If it is something AFP supports, then I will make that known.
@MotorCityLib We will no doubt get to the debt problem (if you think that it is one). But all you say are Obama, Dem, and link to articles.
@MotorCityLib I am actually willing to discuss any topic you wish. We need to establish a baseline though and you aren't willing to.
@MotorCityLib I am fine discussing facts and figures but you don't. You send links. I don't mind the source either, but you have no insight.
@MotorCityLib Back to basics, what is the role of gov't?
@MotorCityLib I can send just as many links to you that refute your liberal websites as well. Are you willing to actually discuss w/ me?
@MotorCityLib Are you willing to actually discuss an issue?
@MotorCityLib Letting me know where you stand on issues enables a discussion. You name call and send links with no opinion of your own.
@MotorCityLib I would be more than happy to discuss with you if you would actually discuss.
@MotorCityLib I read Austrian Economic pages for information. I don't mind articles that debunk them but mind forecasts to 2060.
@MotorCityLib Why is it hard for you to just say the debt is a problem?
@MotorCityLib You are using a forecast that goes to 2060 ... Really? #meaningless
@MotorCityLib Do you think that the national debt is a problem?
@MotorCityLib The national debt is a huge problem. It slows econ. growth. Reform isn't magic and reasonable plans deserve attention.
@MotorCityLib It is Cato not CATO. Not an acronym.
@MotorCityLib Hard to have a discussion if you aren't willing to decide whether or not $15.6 trillion and counting in national debt is bad.
@MotorCityLib Is it a problem? Yes or No?
@MotorCityLib Ok, let's try this again. Is the National Debt a problem? Yes or No.
@MotorCityLib Please answer the questions I asked previously. Avoiding them because you have nothing substantive to say?
@MotorCityLib You lack substance. And you do this a lot. Provide some real insight.
@MotorCityLib Again, I ask what is it then that you support to fix the problem. Unless you don't think that the debt is a problem?
@MotorCityLib Your two articles conflict one another... hmmm. Ryan's plan explodes the debt and is "austerity on steroids"
@MotorCityLib During economic hardship, do you cut back on your personal expenses? If so, why is this only affective at the personal level?
@MotorCityLib Who is to blame for the exploding national debt? Lawmakers or taxpayers?
@MotorCityLib Would you agree that economic freedom has brought more people out of poverty than gov't?
@MotorCityLib Would you agree that both parties are to blame for the exploding debt?
@MotorCityLib Such as?
@MotorCityLib What is it exactly that you support policy-wise?
@MotorCityLib AFP also supports a balanced budget amendment (as does Paul Ryan) which would stop the exploding debt.
@MotorCityLib One liberal economists critique is not enough to consider it a fraud. AFP supports moving towards more economic freedom.
@MotorCityLib Paul Krugman despises Paul Ryan and all he stands for. AFP also suggested more things that they would have liked in the bill.
@motorcitylib I'm curious. Do you even know what the 1.4 means and how it is calculated?

@TheeCalifornian Statistically, if one party controls both legislature and executive, they spend more. Blah, so disappointing.
@TheeCalifornian Do you have the source possibly so I can see how the #s are calculated? I don't disbelieve. Both parties are big spenders.
@TheeCalifornian Does this compare his 3.5 years with the 8 of Bush, Clinton, and Reagan? Do you have a link for this one handy also?
@TheeCalifornian Your second link worked for me. Thanks.
@TheeCalifornian Bush was a big gov't spender and needed to use his veto pen more. I'm a true believer in #economicfreedom

@TheeCalifornian I stopped talking about the rapes. If it wasn't an occupy person, I won't disagree. Violence claims were rampant, however.

@LiberallyLiving @GOPrincess Corporate income taxes hurt the very people that you wish to help. They raise prices and reduce jobs.
@emptywheel Thanks for not providing sources or explanations for your opinions. Be well.
@emptywheel Did Snyder take their money from their accounts? How was their money stolen? Need details so I know what you are referring to.
@emptywheel Like I said, I agree with you that corporate welfare is bad.
@emptywheel Reforming business taxes is not corporate welfare. What the MEDC does is.
@emptywheel And what is it exactly that is meaningless and unlike? So we can continue. You're generalities lack clarity.
@emptywheel What is the apple and orange I am comparing?
@emptywheel Michigan State Budget numbers from the Dept. of Education. Here: http://t.co/WiDWlKiG
@emptywheel Then send me some sources. The numbers are from the Michigan State budget. That is a source. First link in article.
@emptywheel I never stated I was in favor of Snyder. My reply was about education reform and the 2/3 ballot. You made assumptions.
@emptywheel I get that you aren't convinced of anything regardless of sources. That would be anti-knowledge.
@emptywheel I am not for corporate welfare. Your assumptions are misguided. Free and fair markets with no special favors picked by gov't.
@emptywheel Entrepreneurs create wealth &amp; jobs. The MEDC have been robbing money. Their investments never produce the # of jobs expected.
@emptywheel The article I just sent shows that charter schools are not more expensive. That's just not true.
@emptywheel No, in favor of limiting gov't spending. School choice is the answer. School funding still at all time high http://t.co/CtDNprl6
