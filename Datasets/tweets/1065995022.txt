If we do not protect these innocent children from harm, then we are abandoning the basic truth of our humanity.
If we do not send a strong message that every baby has been endowed by its creator with inalienable rights, then we are not defending the fundamental principles of the constitution.
Tonight, the American people heard our call to action: it is time to vote on the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Will the leadership of this House listen? Or will the Democrat majority continue to allow the march toward legalized infanticide?
These precious children are in peril. Their rights are under attack Their lives are at stake. And this House has a responsibility to act.
I have long fought to defend the unborn, but I am shocked that I now have to defend the right to life of newborn infants.
Thank you to my colleagues for joining me to stand up for the most vulnerable among us. We stand together to defend the sanctity of life and to speak out against a radical, anti-life agenda that would effectively legalize infanticide.

Sadly, Democrat leadership in the House is standing in the way, refusing even to allow an up or down vote. This is not a partisan issue. It is simply what's right.
That's why my colleagues and I have called for the House to vote on H.R. 962, the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a commonsense bill to require that medical care be provided to children who survive a failed abortion.
In states like New York and Virginia, legislation could legalize what amounts to infanticide and end safeguards that protect babies born alive after an abortion attempt. That is sickening.
I stand with my colleagues to speak out against the radical and dangerous policies being pursued by Democrat leadership in state legislatures across the country.
HAPPENING NOW: I‚Äôm leading a series of speeches on the House floor to call for protections for infants born alive after failed abortions. We must stand together against infanticide. Watch live on C-SPAN.

More money can‚Äôt fix failed leadership or a broken culture at the IRS. Better guidelines, codified roles, and more intentional strategic planning can.
Unforced errors are turning vital projects into boondoggles. The IRS isn‚Äôt even asking the most basic questions before spending millions on software.
Some of the IRS‚Äôs IT systems date back to the Kennedy administration, but repeated mistakes big and small undermine our trust in the IRS to fix them.
There‚Äôs a trust gap between taxpayers and the IRS, and the IRS‚Äôs information technology systems are a good example of why.

Thanks to @RepHartzler and my fellow @HASCRepublicans for organizing &amp; participating in tonight's special order on #FY16NDAA
As a candidate, @POTUS promised to do the same yet his veto of #FY16NDAA has threatened to end this staple of bipartisanship
For 54 years, the #FY16NDAA has transcended party lines &amp; Washington dysfunction
#FY16NDAA helps our men &amp; women in uniform by adjusting pay and retirement benefits
Today @POTUS vetoed #FY16NDAA to gain leverage for his increased domestic spending demands a process completely unrelated to this bill
For 54 consecutive years, Republicans &amp; Democrats in both this body &amp; the WH have come together to pass this vital legislation #FY16NDAA
The NDAA is the single largest authorization bill that Congress considers &amp; Congress‚Äôs most significant accomplishments each year #FY16NDAA
.@POTUS veto of #FY16NDAA is an act of disrespect to all those who have worn the uniform &amp; their families

Your welcome! RT @FeedINsHungry: Thanks to @RepWalorski for giving a shout out to @FoodBkNIndiana in opening remarks in @HouseAgNews SbCmte
Just wrapped up my 1st @HouseAg subcommittee on Nutrition. Thanks to the witnesses &amp; Members who participated! Great discussion on #SNAP
1 of every 6 children in Indiana are at risk of hunger #SNAP
Today we will hear from a panel of distinguished researchers who have all conducted well-documented studies using trusted gov't data sources
2 of 2: and how long they remained in the program so we better understand how to serve them.
1 of 2: But today is about understanding those families in need. Who they are, what has brought them to the program...
2 of 2: that help feed Hoosiers in my district &amp; provide support to families &amp; children in need.
1 of 2: While I recognize the gov't role in this process, there are local orgs like St. Margaret's House &amp; the Food Bank of northern IN...
That's why its so important that this sbcmte focus our efforts on understanding how SNAP can best serve families &amp; children across the U.S.
2 of 2: and specifically its recipients and find unmet needs and areas of overlap.
1 of 2: It is my hope &amp; expectation that this sbcmte will explore &amp; gain a better understanding of the entire program...
&amp; when I read that 1 in 6 Americans is hungry, it reaffirmed my commitment to ensure no child or adult endures what I've seen others go thru
I know what starvation looks like &amp; how it affects families &amp; communities.
