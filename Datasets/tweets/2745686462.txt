She‚Äôs referring to letters signed by Senate Banking Committee Dems asking for more docs about Kraninger‚Äôs role at OMB https://t.co/QrCjn7A7Ht
And here‚Äôs what I really can‚Äôt figure out: is it that she really is so inexperienced that she doesn‚Äôt have a clue what the answer is or is it that she knows that the answer is so terrible that the American people would cry with one voice she cannot run this agency? - @SenWarren
Protest? 		I think that‚Äôs something we‚Äôll all be talking about, but let‚Äôs be clear: senator after senator after senator asked questions about her role not just in taking away children at the border but every role she has had in government and her entire approach was to deflect
It is absolutely clear after game of dodge ball with the nominee that no vote should go forward with this committee until we get to see the documents about her involvement in taking children away from their mothers at their borders. - @SenWarren
Plans to hold the nomination? ‚ÄúI certainly do. I want to be clear on this. The Democrats all signed a letter saying this hearing should never have occurred without our having access to the basic documents about her current job.‚Äù - @SenWarren

I was amazed she will not, she bills herself: ‚Äúconfirm me because of my management experience‚Äù but she knows nothing about consumer protection, never done it. But she won‚Äôt answer anything about her role in the zero tolerance policy. - @SenSherrodBrown

@Carolina3Vargas UPDATE on the first one - if you search for the person you sent it to, you can find the boomerang email that way and delete it if you decide you don't want to send it.
Freelance piece I wrote that combines my love of animals and clothes --&gt; furry friend fashion for humans! Check out my roundup of #BowWOW &amp; #Purrfect pieces to make fun summer outfits. https://t.co/Zt6Vuigbkh
@Carolina3Vargas The second way (the one I prefer) is under "Options" in the email. You select a day and time to send it and then hit close. You can keep writing and changing the email. When you're ready, hit "send" and it will go to your outbox and sit there until it is schedules to send. https://t.co/1Rda6Dn3ek
@Carolina3Vargas So I figured out two ways to do it. First way:		You have to have your message ready with subject line and person to send it to before this works. Once you select the option for when to send it, the message disappears and I haven't been able to find it in my outbox or sent folder. https://t.co/xLZvkt2vxp
