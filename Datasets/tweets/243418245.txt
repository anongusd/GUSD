Today I look forward to hosting @JY_LeGall, President of the French Space Agency (CNES) in the US House of Representatives as we hear an address from French President Emmanuel Macron. Our space partnership will be reaffirmed today with a signing ceremony at NASA HQ.
@NASA represents the best of our country. We lead, we discover, we pioneer, and we inspire. I look forward to our journey together.
I will do my best to serve our storied agency to the utmost of my abilities as we reach for new heights and reveal the unknown for the benefit of humankind.
I want to thank Robert Lightfoot for his strong leadership as Acting Administrator during a time of transition, and for his decades of service to @NASA and this nation. His legacy is one of leadership and commitment to our mission.
In the last few days, I have heard numerous times "welcome to the @NASA family." It truly feels like a family, and I am humbled to be a part of it.
Thank you @VP for all you and @POTUS are doing to ensure the United States remains the preeminent spacefaring nation.
