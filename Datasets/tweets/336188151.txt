The #UnionDifference is clear: #AAPI women in unions earn approximately $2.00 more per hour than their non-union counterparts in the same types of jobs. #AAPIEqualPay #SEAEqualPay #union
We value the #labor of AAPI women, and that‚Äôs why we support the #PaycheckFairnessAct. #AAPIEqualPay #NotYourModelMinority #SEAEqualPay
Over her career, the typical AAPI woman loses at least $292,400  to the wage gap; in some states, the situation is much worse. #AAPIEqualPay #NotYourModelMinority #SEAEqualPay

#AAPIs are stereotyped as highly educated, but that stereotype hardly reflects reality.

The #ModelMinorityMyth isn‚Äôt an accurate representation of life for many #AAPIs. For instance, 18% and 27% of Cambodian and Hmong families live in poverty, respectively -- yet we rarely hear about their stories and experiences. #CloseTheGap #SEAEqualPay #AAPIEqualPay
Southeast Asian women in the U.S. are paid, on average, only 61 cents for every dollar a white man makes. That means they lose approximately $660,000 over a lifetime! We have to do better than this. #SEAEqualPay #AAPIEqualPay
We need more disaggregated data on our communities. The complex intersections of class, ethnicity, and race impact the economic opportunities of AAPIs -- in particular, Southeast Asian Americans. #SEAEqualPay #AAPIEqualPay https://t.co/OwUTE2xW9W
Did you know? Bhutanese women are paid 51 cents for every $1 paid to their white, nonHispanic counterparts. #SEAEqualPay #AAPIEqualPay. #NotYourModelMinority

Our partnering states have won paid sick days in 42 locations in the U.S.A. Guaranteeing women a bare minimum number of #paidsickdays is key for equality.

Without both #fairpay and #paidsickdays, it's harder for women to access #reprohealth care when deciding if/when/how to start or grow their families. #MomsEqualPay
Erratic, unpredictable schedules make caregiving extremely difficult for low-wage working mothers. To make sure working families are able to secure financial security, we must ensure they have fair, predictable work schedules. https://t.co/aKFkRO5fEC #GenderWageGap #MomsEqualPay
"The truth is that women ask for raises just as often as men, but women are granted raises less often--and to make matters worse, women are also regularly penalized for asking." @rowefinkbeiner #KeepMarching #MomsEqualPay https://t.co/OmI2jj5ixv https://t.co/kmkP7xtpEI
"Clearly, sexuality also needs to be front and center in any discussion about the wage gap as it intersects and adds up to be a double or triple whammy on the pocketbook." @rowefinkbeiner #momsequalpay https://t.co/OmI2jj5ixv https://t.co/Bh7njVGo3k
"More than 80 percent of Black mothers are key breadwinners for their families, which means their households rely heavily on their wages to make ends meet and get ahead." https://t.co/lfvgDkHHx5 #MomsEqualPay
It‚Äôs 2018, and mothers who work outside the home still have to work nearly 5 months longer than fathers to be paid the same amount because they‚Äôre still shortchanged and penalized at 71 cents for every dollar paid to working fathers. #MomsEqualPay https://t.co/4Tb9T5UtMS
#Transgender moms need #EqualPay! The trans &amp; gender nonconforming community experiences poverty @ 4X the rate of general pop. #MomsEqualPay

*Every* working mom should be able to support her family.  Yet despite the crucial contributions they make to our economy, they still make just 71% of what working fathers do. https://t.co/mIWZEv2uTL via @ShriverCenter #EqualPay #MomsEqualPay #GenderWageGap

Did you know that moms make just 71¬¢ compared to every dollar paid to men? This is why we fight for unions, which raise wages of unionized workers by roughly 20%. #Momsequalpay #UnionMom

The blatant sabotage of access to affordable healthcare for Americans in 2017 was appalling - thanks to Trump. #SOTUfails #ProtectOurCare #StateofOurUnion
San Francisco won #PaidSickDays in 2006 and the sky has not fallen. It's time all U.S. workers have access! Support the Healthy Families Act https://t.co/O0oriX7KiA #StateofOURUnion #SOTUfails #SOPSD
Tell your rep. in Congress to support #PaidSickDays for America's workers by passing the Healthy Families Act (HFA) now! No worker should choose between taking a day or two to recover from an illness or losing a job they need to survive https://t.co/K4Jxdjp0Xk #SOTUfails #SOTU
Just another fact you won't hear during #SOTU tonight: Dads are more involved and women are more likely to go back to their jobs with if they have paid leave.  #StateofOurUnion https://t.co/3q4EZNloN8
#LGBTQ pregnant workers need #paidleave to see LGBTQ-competent prenatal care, like doulas, because #OurFamiliesCount #SOTUfails #StateofOURUnion
#Trans workers need nondiscrimination protection to access gender-affirming health care w/o being fired #PaidSickDays #OurFamiliesCount #SOTUfails #StateofOURUnion
#PaidSickDays is a #publichealth issue and a personal finance issue for working families. If this admin knew middle class families, they would support paid sick days for workers. #SOTUfails #StateofOURUnion
IMAGINE being in #pain and not being able to take a #paidsickday to see a doctor for fear of losing your pay or job https://t.co/Kl1WzQQPMx. If America‚Äôs backbone can‚Äôt take a sick days, then #SOTUfails #StateofOURUnion Things #SOTU wont address üò°
It is unconscionable that too many family members must choose between paying rent and taking a day to recover from illness. #PaidLeave #SOTUfails #StateofOURUnion https://t.co/NsNF7Yi7QU
This administration does not understand the importance of #paidleave to our families - or they wouldn‚Äôt exclude so many families and family members from their so-called #PaidLeave proposal #SOTUfails #SOTU lacks "family values"
An A+ #paidleave policy is the only acceptable policy for America‚Äôs workers. Paid leave must be Accessible, Affordable, and Available to all, else #SOTUfails #paidleave #StateofOURUnion
WATCH The State of Paid Leave and Paid Sick Days with Carol Joyner, Wendy Chun-Hoon and Anica Davis:  https://t.co/xbhwJrm2r7 	#SOTU won't tell you the #StateofOURunion and #PaidLeave + #PaidSickDays @laborproject @fmlyvalueswork @BazelonCenter https://t.co/1OD1wNz4rv
A #paidleave plan that EXCLUDES 75% of those needing leave to care for a personal or family member‚Äôs illness is not America. We need #PaidLeave that includes, not excludes. But you wont hear that during #SOTU! #SOTUfails #StateofourUnion
Our families need support for a national paid sick days law and a national family leave insurance program. We urge governors and mayors across the country to move forward with local laws to pave the way. #StateofOURUnion
It‚Äôs time to support #PaidLeave that‚Äôs inclusive of all our families. You wont hear that during #SOTU! #StateofOURUnion #SotuFails https://t.co/MxRUdCZklr

Paid sick days and paid family leave are important to all working families in America. That fact is lost on this administration and you wont hear it in #SOTU. #PaidLeave #SOTUfails
Dads are more involved and #women are more likely to go back to their jobs with #paidleave. But they need leave that is affordable and sustainable. Another fact you won't hear during #SOTU.  Pass the FAMILY Act, value our #dads #SOTUfails üò°  #StateofOurUnion https://t.co/QsdbKIW4GI

Regarding small biz at the override for for MD PSDs - employers with less than 15 employees are exempt.  Between the federal tax breaks and the carve outs if businesses owners can‚Äôt make it, maybe they need to just get a job! @Working_Matters
At MD Override Vote with @Working_Matters Best line:  there‚Äôs a difference between leaders who tweet for small businesses and those who fight for small businesses.  The MD PSDs bill is the best for small biz‚Äôs in the country!  Many biz amendments taken.  Let‚Äôs vote!

Corporate lobbyists crafted FAKE work flex bill so big biz could avoid #PaidSickDays laws. Say No! #ProtectSickDays #DefendDemocracy  #NoHR4219
FAKE work flex bill would replace right to earn and use paid sick days when needed with bosses deciding when and if. #ProtectSickDays #PaidSickDays #NoHR4219
State and local sick days laws are improving conditions in 8 states and 32 localities. Workers don‚Äôt need the FAKE work flex bill. #ProtectSickDays #NoHR4219
Federal preemption would replace right to earn and use #PaidSickDays w/boss deciding when and if you take time to care or heal. #ProtectSickDays #NoHR4219
