Parents are the first educators, I‚Äôm just here to support and mentor.  Btw, I‚Äôm not allowed to show preference in my job, so if I were to be seen at ANY rally I could lose my job...
@JoanLMB @eagle327 @breeburkitt @azcentral @realDonaldTrump Oppsss... my bad.  Sometimes I read too quickly.  Thanks :)
@Stephen02721359 @breeburkitt @azcentral @realDonaldTrump Ah, maybe a few more by now.  I honestly don‚Äôt care.  I‚Äôm just tired of the local media playing it like it‚Äôs some massive event for everyone in the Phoenix area.  I guess it‚Äôs time for me to ‚Äúchange the channel‚Äù or read a different local news paper.
@LynneStone1968 @Joetheranter @azgergman @breeburkitt @azcentral @realDonaldTrump Ahh... thanks for the update.  Had no clue their is an ‚ÄúRight Side Broadcasting Network‚Äù...  Curious, who funds them?
@LynneStone1968 @breeburkitt @azcentral @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm sure most people don‚Äôt have to tell their boss what they‚Äôre doing, my comment was what if the boss is a Democrat and they‚Äôre seen at a political rally.What would the boss think?I hope all of the snarky ness goes away and we can love our country and fellow citizens some day.
@PaulBBury @breeburkitt @azcentral @realDonaldTrump Wow, another twitterer telling me I‚Äôm https://t.co/ge9e3UVzA3,if I were to do my research and look at the hard data from the federal government as to who is on govt handouts,Democrats and Antifa are the only recipients?Seems to me that that‚Äôs not something they ask. Just sayin.
@LynneStone1968 @Joetheranter @azgergman @breeburkitt @azcentral @realDonaldTrump Okay, Lynn, for you I just might do that.  But you‚Äôll have to tell me what RSBN is...  I read news from no fewer than 10 different sources from around the world.  Oh, and most fake news on tv is for entertainment...  It‚Äôs not news... My opinion.
@JoanLMB @eagle327 @breeburkitt @azcentral @realDonaldTrump Wow, you‚Äôre assuming I care about how many followers I have.  Not the case... But you have an awesome day!
@LynneStone1968 @breeburkitt @azcentral @realDonaldTrump Gee Lynn, I didn‚Äôt realize people could get paid time off...(that would be sarcasm).Though I hope they don‚Äôt work for a company that would frown upon a worker taking time off to stand in line for a ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù rally.Never know what the boss will think when they see them on tv
@RobCorsaro @breeburkitt @azcentral @realDonaldTrump Thanks for telling me to do myself a favor.I just love it when people out in Twitter land know what‚Äôs best for me. I was a Republican for 35 years, until this past year.I‚Äôve changed parties to another one.I refuse to give money and time to a party that is no longer who they were.
@Joetheranter @azgergman @breeburkitt @azcentral @realDonaldTrump Enjoy the rally Joe, I‚Äôll be watching for you.  I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll find you in the 40k, but I bet you‚Äôll be holding a sign, wearing a red hat, and yelling at the press.
@Joetheranter @breeburkitt @azcentral @realDonaldTrump Wow, Joe, thanks for telling me I‚Äôm stupid and a leftist.  I prefer to make judgements like that when I meet people. FYI, I‚Äôm neither stupid nor a leftist.  I‚Äôm a college educated white female who is a grandma..I‚Äôm for humanity, not just one group of people. Have a wonderful day!
@eagle327 @breeburkitt @azcentral @realDonaldTrump Haha.. you have a wonderful day.
@breeburkitt @azcentral @realDonaldTrump Hmmm... 1/4 mile is about 300 people.  Sounds about right. Also, don‚Äôt these people have jobs to go to? If they‚Äôre so scared brown people are going to come take the jobs away, then why don‚Äôt they get to work? Just a thought.. ü§î

@gary_w_ellis @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson I could answer this is so many ways, but I‚Äôm not going to.  Please have a wonderful day tomorrow, and the next.  Life is too short to worry about what others are doing or saying.

@AaronSeitsinger @abc15 @PHXSkyHarbor I never said that. The few times American presidents have visited our area,Ihave been inconvenienced by traffic etc.Oh, and they were from different political parties.I don‚Äôt need all of the local media hounding me about ANY president landing 10 minutes early!
@gary_w_ellis @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson What invaders???  I have lived along the border my entire life and have yet to have someone invade my house, neighborhood, etc.  Once again, I‚Äôve never demanded drugs, so I‚Äôve never needed any to be supplied!  No invaders.. simple, isn‚Äôt it!
@abc15 @PHXSkyHarbor Nope!  Thanks for the update, but Arizona has A LOT of viewers/residents who would prefer that the man who occupies the White House right now would just go away!  He‚Äôs wasting my hard earned money, stopping traffic, making the local ‚Äúmedia‚Äù go crazy. I‚Äôll be changing the channel.
@dmarbattalionNY @kyrstensinema @MarthaMcSally She‚Äôs never hated Arizona.  Really, really, take a look at what she‚Äôs done.
