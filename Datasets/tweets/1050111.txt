Respect to Bernie for not changing his logo. I hope Beto does the same.
@neeratanden It seems like you’re saying a brokered convention is quite likely
Also Bernie’s life is made a lot easier if both Harris and Biden are viable by the time the south rolls around
If consolidation occurs following IA-NH it’s likely to redound somewhat to the benefit of Bernie if he’s the frontrunner and not just fellow lane-dwellers. People will go for the momentum play.
Made easier if Biden gets in and stays in. I don’t see Obama’s well-liked VP going below 10-15% in the early states absent some truly catastrophic performance. This complicates matters for Harris et al.
You’ll have up to a dozen “serious” candidates competing in Iowa and 5-8 in New Hampshire because some will skip Iowa. If Bernie wins NH with 30% while others are in the teens he becomes hard to stop.
@neeratanden Easier when you have a bunch of candidates who don’t clear thresholds
I would just like to point out that winning the nomination with 30% of the vote in a crowded field is very doable

What's stunning is that there is no evidence of higher Latino turnout (either in '16 or '18) post-Trump and that any growth is coming from new registrants. This is consistent with the finding that Latino heritage does not predict views on immigration. https://t.co/BBhTNsyN3D

This thread is also a Moment.  		⚡️ “The Real Turnout Story 2018: Florida”		https://t.co/RqQ1ziYpOz
When you match this up with turnout performance, black turnout was partially able to counteract older white turnout, but Latino dropoff really complicated Dem hopes statewide. https://t.co/IasMC12LgP
The challenges Democrats face are highlighted by the composition of the Florida electorate. Whites 55+ are simply a massive group here (39% of all ‘18 voters) who lean more Republican than Hispanics lean Dem. And white millennials lean GOP by registration. https://t.co/P60JtJ66Er
Republicans also did better turnout-wise among all but the very youngest Hispanics. Interestingly, there was an anomalous turnout bump among under-40 whites and Latinos, but NOT among blacks.
Here is how this breaks out by race — since many of these trends are compositionally driven. STRONG Dem turnout advantage among white millennials canceled out by a flood of Republican votes among older votes. https://t.co/dW5zVCbSVD
Age is such a huge factor in Florida politics. Overall Democrats had a turnout advantage among voters aged 45 and under, but most voters are over 45, with a strong GOP advantage among seniors. https://t.co/Yufo9RRipC
Among whites, Dems clearly did better in areas with lots of degree-holders, but they underperformed except in the most educated precincts with Hispanics. https://t.co/Ozw8NjrqvX
The lack of major college-ed heavy population centers (like Atlanta in GA) also hampered Democrats. As was the case nationally, their turnout was better in areas with more degrees, but the votes were in precincts with fewer college degrees. https://t.co/6Y9iA1KOeJ
Florida was also home to a number of competitive Congressional races, including Dem pickups in two Clinton-won Miami-based seats. Even in those seats, turnout shifted right post-’16. The reddest shift came in Mario Diaz-Balart’s FL-25, a Trump +1 that he won by 21. https://t.co/H3tNz8aHwc
Tallahassee and the panhandle. Dems did best turnout-wise in the capital but big turnout drops in Hurricane Michael affected areas seemed to hurt them. https://t.co/PqJmvBSDYf
Democrats’ best, most consistent regional performance turnout came in the Jacksonville area. They also saw big turnout gains in Alachua (home of Gainesville and the UF campus) https://t.co/ZRm8Ha4JW4
Orlando and the I-4 corridor. Seminole County (America’s #7 most typical!) trended Dem. https://t.co/YGjAMFBw3S
Same idea but for Tampa Bay / SW Florida. https://t.co/vyttLDdSqK
Here’s which party gained from turnout trends along Florida’s Gold Coast. It benefited the GOP in Little Havana, Dems in African American areas, and was more mixed overall in Broward and Palm Beach Counties. https://t.co/kR3HLxuvO7
Here's what this looks like when you overlay precincts on top of it. https://t.co/XtZyow9RzU
Here is how this all plays out in shifting the turnout composition by county across the state. It’s basically a wash in most metropolitan areas except for a blue shift in Jacksonville, Tallahassee, and Gainesville. North Florida rurals continue shift right, even after ‘16. https://t.co/bDHKCqNSlD
It gets more interesting crossing age and party. ‘18 was still a lower turnout election than ‘16, so we’d expect to see young voters down — except 18-29 Democrats were pretty good! Dems’ weakest groups were 30-44s. https://t.co/aa9giEHQln
Let’s try breaking this out by race and party. Here we see: 		✅ White GOP consistently strong everywhere	✅ White Dems strong everywhere except northern rurals	✅ Hispanic Dems and Indys down everywhere https://t.co/uiZiiRtj4s
Now, let’s turn to geography. The most notable turnout dropoffs came in Hurricane Michael-affected counties, other North Florida rurals… and Miami-Dade (due to the Hispanic vote). Retiree-heavy Gulf Coast counties and Sumter performed strongly. https://t.co/27kIuq2h38
In fact, breaking out turnout by race and party, we see that entirety of Dem turnout underperformance vs. ‘16 is due to Hispanics.  		White GOP 95.0%	White Dem 95.1%	White Ind 89.8%		Hispanic GOP 90.0%	Hispanic Dem 83.9%	Hispanic Ind 80.3%		Black Dem 94.6%	Black Ind 98.5%
Both the Florida and Georgia have race on the file, so race numbers should be fairly comparable. 		It’s worth noting that stronger Latino numbers in Georgia are due largely to growth from a low base. Turnout rates among those registered in ‘16 were as low as in Florida.
Black turnout was stronger than white turnout (vs. ‘16) but not by Stacey Abrams levels in GA. And look at the Hispanic dropoff.		African-Americans 95.0%	Whites 93.9%	Hispanics 84.6%	Asians 91.3%		(In GA, blacks were at 98.5%, whites at 93.6%, Hispanics at 95.2%.)
Men vote more in midterms than in Presidentials, and Florida is no exception. Men voted at 93.7% of ‘16 rates and women at 91.4%. The electorate was a bit more female than ‘14, though.
Turnout was, however, to the left of 2014’s strong Republican year. Here’s turnout as a % of 2014:		Democrats 151.8%	Republicans 138.2%	Independent 188.6%
In contrast to other states, the Florida electorate ended up to the right of 2016. Here’s partisan turnout as a percentage of ‘16: 		Republican 94.4%	Democrat 92.9%	Nonpartisan 88.1%		Had Dems outperformed the GOP like they did in other states, Nelson and Gillum would have won.
Top takeaways from the 2018 Florida voter file:		✅ STRONG GOP turnout among Boomers	✅ Good black turnout, but not as good as Georgia (on a smaller % of voters)	✅ Weaker Latino turnout, especially among Democrats	✅ Dem millennial turnout bump, but limited to whites &amp; Latinos
Florida stands out as a bright spot for Republicans in 2018. Rick Scott won. Ron DeSantis won. 		Turnout trends and the composition of the Florida electorate explains a lot. 		Let me take you on a journey through the Florida voter file.

If I’m a Dem, I think this is a no-brainer. He’s got a brand. Trump won’t be branding him from scratch.
The problem for Bernie critics is that no one has built a convicing case for why he’d be problematic as the nominee. He can point to strong poll numbers. And Trump has created a precedent for ideologically transgressive nominees.

According to pollsters and admakers, the main thing Dems would do if they won the majority in 2018 is protect pre-existing conditions. 		They won the majority and now we're talking about:		- Banning private insurance	- Banning cars/airplanes	- 9 month abortion	- Wealth taxes
@leedrutman Basically the best way for a pure progressive to be favored to win in a Democratic primary is to be nonwhite, because progressives can't do it on their own.
@leedrutman I've been banging this drum for a while, but there's still a good argument that nonwhites are operationally more moderate in the context of Democratic primaries.
I get how political reporters can lean one way in their analysis and say what they really think in green rooms. I've seen it, I get it. It's a whole other thing for them to be trafficking in hilariously bad spin as if they were comms assistants for the people they're covering.
@shhund Plus you can drive 90 mph on those highways and it's nbd
@shhund I'm assuming the difference in cost between flying to these places has something to do with market conditions/demand (which is also a key factor in making HSR viable)?
@asymmetricinfo "Budget" in the US is like 20% cheaper though, not like &lt;$100 to anywhere on the continent? Nothing like the consumer bonanza in the immediate aftermath of deregulation.
@shhund This is essentially the business case for Amtrak over air travel from DC to NYC but the case pretty quickly evaporates at longer distances. There's only so much HSR can do to extend that range in a country as spread out as the US.
High speed rail (and rail in general) works in Europe because of the short distances between major cities, but my sense is that it's also been undercut by ultra-cheap budget airlines (which basically don't exist in the US).
PS — none of this stuff is remotely going to happen. Ever.
(I fully expect the fallback argument here to be that we need Venezuela-like monetary policy to get this done.)
Dems have a hammerlock on CA/NY state government that they can use to move the ball forward on the M4A &amp; GND agenda. Instead we have Newsom giving up on high speed rail and New York can't even get AVR done, not to mention every state attempt at single payer going kaput.

@MattGrossmann @gelliottmorris @DaveAHopkins I look forward to reading, and this discussion has definitely piqued my interest more! My point is that a lot of these measures need to do more to take into account basic differences in how conservatives and liberals think.
@gelliottmorris @MattGrossmann @DaveAHopkins Because a lot of this work fundamentally misunderstands how conservatism works. Liberals want to change the status quo and this lends itself to specific policy proposals to pursue each of these changes one at a time vs. wanting to conserve what works which doesn't.
@MattGrossmann @daveweigel @ezraklein The parties are different in that one has a sizable contingent of nonwhites, but this overlooks the growing tendency of white liberals to act as a mirror image and counterweight to white conservatives.
@MattGrossmann @daveweigel @ezraklein Which is pretty much the dictionary definition of "conservative." What we're getting at is asymmetries with conservative and liberal ideology, not something that exists at the party level.
@MattGrossmann @daveweigel @ezraklein The point on specific policies vs. broad values is also a difference in how the ideologies are structured: Expansions of government are easy to frame in terms of specific policies, a broader resistance to government power requires no specific policies, simply to conserve.
@MattGrossmann @daveweigel @ezraklein Conservatives don't accept the premise of inevitable conflict between classes, and in focus groups I've done, much the same applies to race. They are optimistic and think many of these problems have gotten much better over time.
@MattGrossmann @daveweigel @ezraklein 1) Isn't this an artifact of liberal ideology being structured around race and class conflict to a greater degree? 		2) What are the racial breakouts of these ideological placements and how have they been changing over time?
That's why I think it's more accurate to describe the races as divided by the kinds of politics they like to practice, not the parties.
Rather you have a white majority rowing clearly in a liberal ideological direction who control the agenda (and are sympathetic to nonwhite claims on ideological grounds) and culturally moderate/conservative nonwhite bloc which serves as a check on liberal whites.
Matt is correct in the sense that you do have a significant minority of Democrats whose interests may diverge from the main liberal ideological thrust, but that's different than saying that Democratic politics is mainly defined by brokered interest group politics.
@willwilkinson Most voters have no idea how policy preferences should align with ideological labels, but have a very deeply held tribal sense of what kind of person they are that aligns neatly with the conservative/liberal labels.
The proof is right in here. Democrats are increasingly willing to adopt the "liberal" label. Dig deeper into the data and you'll find many of the remaining moderates/conservatives to be nonwhites who are loyal to the party for institutional, not ideological, reasons. https://t.co/i0F3K9BImR
"Democrats are just a party of squabbling interest groups" is an old trope from the era of Southern conservatives vs. Northern liberals that no longer really applies today. Both parties are sorted nearly perfectly ideologically*		* Among whites
I really like this convo between @ezraklein and @MattGrossmann but I disagree both with Matt's premise and Ezra's pushback. The parties are becoming more similar, and it's because the Democrats are growing more ideological. https://t.co/cFuN69ogoo

AOC's ascendance is probably the worst thing that could happen for socialism in the US. She's completely stolen Bernie's thunder as leader of the movement but can't run herself, to the benefit of woke corporatist candidates who support M4A but probably won't push that hard for it

@NateSilver538 Is Schultz really an example of corporate power, as you claim, is he just Morning Joe-ism undistilled? It seems pretty hard to argue that it has nothing to do with the latter. I doubt that a Ricketts running would attract the same coverage.
@NateSilver538 It seems weird to center this whole debate around the nascent Schultz effort, which will probably amount to little when all is said and done, and the fact that we elected Trump based on his skill playing the *New York-centric media*
@NateSilver538 I don’t know where Trump fits into this model exactly, but the $2 billion in free media he got seems to have been a lot more influential in 2016 than the money he spent on his campaign or that others spent for him — which wasn’t much. Don’t think one Fortune 500 CEO endorsed.
@NateSilver538 I’m going to say both wield pretty disproportionate influence relative to their voting strength, and saying that billionaires definitively wield more is a pretty transparent exercise in playing “hide the ball” on the part of the media.
@NateSilver538 Partly that's due to a coastal-centric worldview that reflects the smartypants/media-worldview of what a "sane" center / center-right looks like. Would Trump have gotten the same level of attention if he weren't the king of New York tabloid media?

Spoiler: Basically the only officials ever safe within their party from scandals are Presidents and major party nominees.
There’s probably a decent poli-sci paper to be written on how big an officeholder needs to be before the party thinks twice about throwing them over the side in a scandal.
Perriello challenged Northam in 2017 but it was pretty unexpected and last-minute, and the first contested primary against one of the major officeholders.
The one term limit for Virginia governors but not LG/AG creates a cartel like system where bloody primaries are avoided because everyone can safely wait their turn. We are now seeing the consequences of such a system.

I was in Venezuela weeks before Chavez won his first election. It was a normal Latin American country with deep affinity and familiarity with the U.S. We watched the Yankees win the World Series in a sports bar.
And breaking 2-to-1 for one party means a piddling 33% efficiency. With not explicitly ideological candidates you’re down to 10-20% efficiency at most. Plus the third party vote is less the more competitive the state.
The idea of a third party “spoiler” is overrated and only ever happens in hyper-close races. Ideological third parties will break at most 3-to-1 for one party (not counting those who won’t vote) making for a max 50% efficiency of vote share.
Candidates can afford to take extreme positions because with Congress gridlocked there’s zero chance they get passed into law. This makes our political system as a whole pretty moderate.

@TheLincoln @ryangrim @updatingpriors I mean... it’s not just journalism that’s funded this way. Virtually anyone who works full time in progressive politics advocating for these policies is doing so because some very rich person got very lucky once.
@WynkoopViews The point is it’s not being hoarded if it’s being put to work in a financial instrument of any type. And you’ve got billionaires who’ve already pledged to give away &gt;90% of their wealth. This just reduces the base from which they can do that pretty dramatically.
@AlanMCole @Noahpinion Especially since the wealthy would now be incentivized to light money on fire with more conspicuous consumption rather than face a new tax on assets that would earn them a return
@mattsgorman It’s amazing that Democrats don’t want to continue the legacy of President Obama

It’s cute that people think these assets aren’t put to use. They’re used to fund the entire startup economy, the #1 net job creator. The massive concentration of wealth is also being used to wipe out malaria, fund clean energy, and reach new frontiers in space.
Due to compound interest, the progressively lower amounts able to be invested year after year due to Warren’s tax would have a much greater effect than 2% a year.
@ggreeneva Correct — the 2% would compound over time and have an even greater effect on the actual return
We all know about compounding returns. Warren’s 64% wealth tax spread over 50 years would wipe out highly performing assets and use them to fund a bureaucracy with zero social or financial returns.
Don’t call Warren’s tax a 2% tax. Over 10 years it would wipe out 18% of wealth over $50M and over 50 years it would wipe out 64%. Over a billion dollars it would wipe out 27% over 10 years and 82% (!) over 50. And that’s not taking into account the returns on these assets.

From a libertarian perspective what do we think of government by GoFundMe
@gelliottmorris In the regressions I’ve run on the 2018 House primary elections, women had a 9 point advantage in Democratic primaries and no bias in Republican primaries when controlling for fundraising and incumbency. And there is unlikely to be anti-woman bias in the 2020 primaries.
@gelliottmorris What is the evidence of this in presidential elections?
@gelliottmorris No, there’s no evidence that Hillary was punished more for a lack of charisma than Walter Mondale was
@gelliottmorris 5/ No one would ever accuse AOC or Nikki Haley of not being likable! In my experience these evaluations are pretty objective regardless of gender.
@gelliottmorris 4/ To use a woke phrase, in my own “lived experience”, to give male candidates a pass on likability when we know how decisive it is in shaping public perception makes no sense. Weren’t we just all dunking on Schumer for not being as good on Twitter as AOC?
@gelliottmorris 3/ But likability as a decisive, if not THE decisive factor in the nearly all male dominated field of Presidential politics has pretty much been a thing forever. https://t.co/81ui3d0WiJ
@gelliottmorris 2/ The record with female candidates at the Presidential level is pretty thin and with female nominees it’s n=1, and that obviously will change in 2020 so we’ll have a chance to test these hypotheses
@gelliottmorris 1/ I don’t rule out the possibility that there could be effects in downballot races, and my tweet was pretty specifically limited to Presidential politics which are pretty much their own beast when it comes to scrutiny of likability
@gelliottmorris I judge these things from the real world of campaigns. That’s the difference between being a practitioner and being an academic.		It’s very clear that Bush 41, Dole, and McCain were judged harshly by voters on likability despite being eminently qualified. Same for Gore/Kerry.
@gelliottmorris Lawrence, Rose, and Lawless probably faced penalties for running as Democrats in the first Obama midterm cycle
@DanRosenheck McCain, Dole, Bush 41 vs. Clinton
You would have to ignore the Kerry, Gore, Dole, Bush 41, Mondale, Carter, and Nixon ‘60 campaigns to come to the opposite conclusion https://t.co/yFrK6TN5fp
@stubedobedu https://t.co/m5Sv8pMupp
@DanRosenheck I think John Kerry and Al Gore faced likability penalties as punishing as those Warren and Hillary Clinton faced.
Hot take: Presidential politics is a punishing business and male candidates face the same likability thresholds and scrutiny as female candidates. https://t.co/qFr30pWh33

It would seem that Trump *has* lost ground since the shutdown started - costing him ONE point in job approval - and he's not at a low for his presidency. Plus the likelihood is that these numbers bounce back once the shutdown ends.

The difference in traditional media mentions of AOC and Dan Crenshaw is a pretty easy measure of media bias
The reason that matching funds have fallen by the wayside is that candidates have been able to raise *much more* without them. It's a strange thing for Dems to argue that there's not enough money in politics as it stands and we need taxpayer money back in.
Like, I'm not even convinced that the other stuff (including AVR) helps Dems. Trump's election followed a number of states adopting online registration &amp; more liberal early voting laws. But the "public match for ActBlue" is positively a power grab.
The small donor public match in the Democrats' HR 1 is quite the poison pill. 		Had it been in place in 2018, it'd have forced the taxpayers to write an eight figure check to Beto's Senate campaign on top of the $75M (more than enough) that he already raised.

It’s also amazing to me that there does not seem to be a pro-adult, just-get-stuff-done, stop-embarrassing-us lane that is also not trying to push a particular partisan vision first. There was a market for that in the early ‘90s and it seems like this should clean up today.
It’s amazing how heterodox that 1992 Democratic field was.		Paul Tsongas ran on not demonizing Wall Street and a capital gains tax cut.		Jerry Brown ran on a 13-percent flat tax.		Bill Clinton was a DLCer who was nonetheless able to come at them from the left.
@DouthatNYT Exactly why you need broad based tax cuts as a lubricant!

@BBrind Fair! The BPL is the only national league that works.
@mbnocedal The BPL has robust competition between 5-6 top teams, other national leagues less so.
@mbnocedal There has been some talk of a breakaway league becoming the main format for inter-club competition which has been nearly universally panned but is hard to argue against when some super-teams dominate their national leagues.
Juventus (Serie A becoming La Liga except with one team) is probably a good argument for a European super league.
Right. Let's not forget that New Hampshire is still pretty darn partial to regional candidates, which might come in handy for Warren if Bernie falters/doesn't run. https://t.co/i3dpVWFTid
Plus moving early I assume offers some advantages in terms of staffing, and she had been facing some challenges in this department.
I will say that Warren's timing was probably pretty smart: 1) The conversation does actually seem to have moved on from the DNA test, and 2) Her lack of competition right now makes it harder to draw comparisons to potentially more exciting options (Harris, Beto, etc.)
It's going to be easy to offer up hot takes, but your default posture on 2020 right now should be aggressively agnostic.
RT @davealvord164: @PatrickRuffini "Everybody has a plan until they get punched."	--- @MikeTyson 		https://t.co/8cKc6NxEuR
Trying to assess the "fundamentals" of these candidates is not likely to hold up well without a sense of how they do in hand-to-hand combat.
Or Beto, who didn't even hire a pollster in '18 and made a show of not having consultants. That may be ok in a blue wave without a big target on your back from other Democrats but not having an operation in a Presidential primary is pretty much guaranteed to not work out well.
It's easy to sketch out a scenario where Kamala Harris eclipses Warren based on gender PLUS the African American vote PLUS California. But she could also do poorly in debates, have a bad fundraising quarter, etc. that would instantly call all that into question.
It's very difficult to evaluate 2020 viability without a sense of how the candidates perform under attack, on stage in debates, or in hiring staff. Remember that Hillary's invincibility in '08 was first pierced by that random drivers licenses hit from Chris Dodd (!)

@kdrum @davidshor @NateSilver538 Ah yes, same issue with Ted Cruz and Victor Cruz in 2016. But I looked at the pre-Beto candidacy baseline and it seemed quite minimal.
Google Trends is helpful for measuring overall interest in an election (growing volume for all candidates and how well volume share matches polling tells you that low-information voters are paying more attention).
The interestingness/demographic appeal of candidates creates distortions that make Google Trends not an exact proxy for polling (GT was extremely pro-Sanders in 2016 and somewhat pro-Trump) but you'll want to be looking at candidates' change over time.
Beto does indeed have a lead on other leading Dems in Google Trends. Google's topic aggregation normally does a good job for most public figures, but for Beto, so the most accurate thing is just to measure his first name @kdrum @NateSilver538 https://t.co/FyLqfpcdjt

@StephenPAdams It certainly didn’t help that CA were bad faith actors who also happened to have a Trump connection (though the data wasn’t used for Trump...) but it would help if our assessments of this didn’t solely hinge on such ad hoc judgments
@rsg The core thing that this was about was harvesting the friend graph without *explicit consent* from each node in the graph. Which is something that continues to this day.
@rsg YES, CA obtained data improperly using an academic imprimatur. That said, had they collected the data themselves (which they could have with a big enough platform/ad budget) and packaged it the same way it still would have been found to be highly problematic.

What were your best reads of 2018?
Hard Landing is a business classic I read this year, a rollicking and enjoyable tale about competition in the airline industry post-deregulation
I also have to shout out Identity Crisis, about the 2016 campaign. These authors have a real beat on how to analyze political campaigns and the outside metrics that really matter and tell the story.
Oliphant and Wilkie’s The Road to Camelot is probably the best political history I’ve read of 1960, more textured and covers more ground than Teddy White’s classic The Making of the President
And of course, Jordan Ellenberg’s How Not to Be Wrong, a terrific primer on thinking mathematically
Books about the present and the future:		- Tyler Cowen’s The Great Stagnation	- Atul Gawande’s The Checklist Manifesto	- Alec Ross’s The Industries of the Future		Currently greatly enjoying #TheCoddling of the American Mind, especially the parts that extend beyond campus
So, favorite books this year.		This year was about binging on the classics, so not a lot is new. Of these the best were:		- Cramer’s What It Takes	- Caro’s The Path to Power	- Manchester’s Alone	- Foote’s The Civil War (especially Volume 3)
The American Christmas song oeuvre is proof of our country’s exceptionalism and that we’ll never be one of those dead European social democracies

Here's what happens when we limit this just to look at white voters. https://t.co/tuPN9qbgbL
Another fun map: Where turnout was mostly up (blue) or mostly down (orange) from '16 in the Atlanta metro, by Census block group. https://t.co/48yK6ED0gN
This thread is available as a Moment. 		⚡️ “The Real Turnout Story 2018: Georgia”		https://t.co/Qz6pdj796q
Lots of elements of this are confirmed by Catalist's analysis, which also shows black voters surging to '08 and '12 levels as a share of the electorate. https://t.co/sYfCQ3wkKp
Because turnout spiked so high in Georgia, partisan differences among whites weren't quite as great, and the non-college white vote got out. But Democrats had a black turnout surge they don't appear to have had in other states, thanks to who was on top of the ticket.
The key difference was black Democrats, who surged more than whites in all kinds of precincts. https://t.co/pKTyNHusn6
Dems did surge a little more in more educated precincts, but this dynamic was not as pronounced as in California. https://t.co/Q10C8hH8L6
(There is a conversation to be had about whether going for a Beto over a non-white nominee is the best thing for Dem turnout in 2020. It seems like Dems were able to recapture some of that Obama era magic here, reversing GA-6 even while losing statewide.)
This dynamic changed with African American Dems Abrams and Lucy McBath on the ballot. In GA-6, Dems got higher black turnout and better numbers from white Democrats. 		Turnout vs. '16 in GA-6		African Americans 103.0%	White Dem 97.8%	White GOP 93.8%
Diving a bit deeper into GA-6, using a similar voter file analysis from the Ossoff special, I made the argument that African Americans there were not turning out for post-Obama Resistance Dems. https://t.co/QRJm2zDyR6
A CD-level map of the relative turnout shifts since '16 shows huge Dem gains in the metro Atlanta seats, including the 6th, which they flipped. It's fairly clear from this that the GOP would have held the 6th with a '16 electorate. https://t.co/117nHWPMEh
Compare this to precinct level increases for white voters. We see mostly weaker performance on turnout, except for the educated, close-in Atlanta suburbs. https://t.co/zgXtJzFrMV
The same map, but for black voters. Turnout increases everywhere, except perhaps for inner city Atlanta. https://t.co/JJQjpngP8E
A statewide precinct map of turnout vs. '16 is instructive. Blue shows stronger performance, orange weaker. Turnout surged in nearly all of Atlanta metro, except the white GOP strongholds to the north. https://t.co/BWlehoRb0c
And here is that same map, overlaying precinct data. https://t.co/hDnCubMNti
On a county level, here's where turnout got redder or bluer vs. 2016. Metro Atlanta got bluer. https://t.co/AX6u7yb3iv
Breaking out turnout vs. '16 further by race and party.		Black Non-Partisans 101.4%	Black Dem Primary 98.5%	Black Dem Non-Primary 94.1%		Differences among whites were more muted: 		White Dem 93.8%	White Dem Primary 96.9% 	White GOP 93.8%	White GOP Primary 95.6%
The big story here is race. Here's turnout vs. '16 by race (where we have good data). 		African-Americans 98.5%	Whites 93.6%	Asians 92.5%	Hispanics 95.2%		Stacey Abrams made a difference.
In Georgia, men voted at 96.3% of '16 rates, and women voted at 94.0%.
Turnout shifts vs. '14 were not quite as dramatic as in California, but that's probably largely because of the limited tools we have to ID non-primary voters in states like GA. Here's turnout as a % of '14:		Democrat 128%	Republican 122.5%	Nonpartisan 408.2%
Turnout as a % of 2016 by modeled party in Georgia: 		Democrat 96.1%	Republican 93.7%	Nonpartisan 95.8%		Among *primary* voters - important because Georgia has no party registration.		Democrat 98.2%	Republican 95.6%
It's time to break down some more 2018 voter file data. Now up: Georgia.

If this works it would be approximately 14 Betos https://t.co/X5visqX0g4
It does make a difference on the margin. Looking *just* at voters registered in 2016, Rs are at 77.5% of '16 turnout, Dems at 76.7%. This reversal likely affects the statewide margin by 1-2 points. https://t.co/Kah9iFqGAL
Breaking this out by race shows this basic pattern holding across all groups, with lower base Hispanic turnout. https://t.co/uuIx4iiQVq
Turnout vs. '16 was highest in very educated precincts, especially among Democrats, and especially among the smaller number of non-primary voting Democrats. https://t.co/9ettmEFExh
Of course, we can say that roughly recreating a '16 electorate is fantastically good for Dems and it was. Compared to '14, turnout made these seats dramatically bluer than they were then, with the greatest relative effects in competitive seats in CA-25 and CA-45. https://t.co/UsyiSi2kx6
This is how relative turnout advantage vs. '16 play out on a district-by-district basis, among all voters. https://t.co/4RLJF4Cj2a
Here's how turnout vs. '16 played out in key Dem Congressional gains		CA-10	D 93.2%	R 91.8%		CA-21	D 73.5%	R 71.8%		CA-25	R 86.2%	D 84.4%		CA-39	R 85.7%	D 85.7%		CA-45	D 100.5% (!)	R 94.5%		CA-48	D 100.6% (!)	R 94.3%
The district with the best turnout versus 2016 was Nancy Pelosi's CA-12, at 98.7%. That's San Francisco, obviously.
We see the localized effects of white Democratic turnout at the precinct level. Turnout got bluer in predominantly white areas of Southern California, and disadvantaged Democrats in predominantly nonwhite areas, though of course there are few Republicans there, so little effect. https://t.co/YszQiaV8zI
Lower (vs. '16) turnout among minorities muddies this trend a little, but Democrats did have a turnout advantage among white voters. 		White Democrats voted at 86.7% of '16	White Republicans voted at 81.0%
Now, here's the same map, but *ONLY* looking at voters we think are white. https://t.co/ohJljVZPuq
Excluding a handful of counties that seem to be missing quite a bit of vote history, here's where county turnout got redder vs. bluer compared to '16 https://t.co/RQlWuoYiFB
Men voted at a higher rate compared to '16 than women. Their rate was 80.5%, vs. women at 79.0%
Voting by modeled race as a percentage of '16		Whites voted at 83.1% of '16	Blacks at 76.8%	Hispanics at 70.0%	Asians at 85.4%
The change in California compared to '14 is quite striking. 		Democrats voted at 165% of '14	Republicans voted at 128% of '14	Others voted at 195%		Among non-primary voters:		Democrats voted at 560% (!!!)	Republicans voted at 323% (!)	Others voted at 527% (!!)
Based on mostly complete numbers that are subject to change, the California electorate was slightly more Democratic than '16		Democrats voted at 81.0% of '16	Republicans voted at 79.8%	Others voted at 77.4%
First, the necessary throat-clearing. The major data point I'll be presenting in this series is turnout as a % of '16 (both because '18 was unexpectedly closer to '16, and because '16 is the relevant benchmark for '20). But comparisons to '14 are striking and will be made.
Okay, okay. You asked for it. We've got California vote history. It's very nearly complete, and seems to have some holes in a few counties (including San Diego) that I'll omit from the maps.

@riccaric I think a large part of the reason why markets haven't arisen in the sale of one's personal data is that this data is by and large not valuable in and of itself.
Companies are behaving rationally - using large datasets to be marginally more targeted in their advertising and Pareto-optimizing effort levels in order to achieve these marginal efficiencies.
This NYT piece illustrates how far one can go with this data if one were motivated to do so, but the corporations who use it are rarely motivated in this way. It's striking how divorced these analyses are from the actual day-to-day use cases. https://t.co/0aeBgngXZc
We may want to erect guardrails from keeping the theoretical from turning into the actual... But in terms of everything from garden-variety commercial targeting to nefarious disinformation operations, the common thread is how basic and unsophisticated these programs actually are.
While is abundantly clear is that those harms are possible, but largely theoretical - because it isn't worth a company's time to analyze a person's individual patterns of behavior. It's not scalable.
With all of this, it's easy to ask: Where are the actual consumer HARMS? Whose livelihood is being hurt by this data collection? Who was subject to individual-level surveillance as a result?
Sure, we can track everyone's location minute-by-minute... but most of the uses of this data seem awfully pedestrian: Show people ads about a store as they're passing by it, or count the number of people shopping at Walmart.
Most of the applications of Big Data by the major social platforms are strikingly BASIC and amount to simple remarketing or affinity targeting (show people who like X things about X). Most advertisers don't even bother to suppress people out who've already bought X.
What I think we'll ultimately find with most of these data scandals is that mass data collection didn't ultimately prove that useful, and that most platforms are sheepishly winding down many of these programs because they didn't work.
I’ll believe something is a mass advertising medium when thought leaders decide it’s not for them and start leaving it

New York City has a wide range of scores. Manhattan is in the bottom of 2.5% in terms of "averageness" but Staten Island is VERY average and Queens is more typical than a majority of the U.S. The close-in DC metro as a whole is weirder than NYC. #ExploretheMAP
But not a far drive outside D.C. are counties that are very representative of the country as a whole that also aren't West Virginia. These include Baltimore County, MD or Wicomico (Salisbury), MD. #ExploretheMAP
Arlington, VA is also very weird, and ranks #2 in the percentage of people with a college degree. https://t.co/9hsZ02RAdH #ExploretheMAP https://t.co/rKj5Nuiott

Because we're measuring how "average" a county is, both highly educated, urban counties and very rural and poor counties rank as less representative of the country as a whole. Some of the most atypical counties are in the DC metro &amp; in Coal Country. #ExploretheMAP

The phrase "will it play in Peoria?" turns out to be quite apt. Peoria County, Ill. is the fifth most typical county in the United States. https://t.co/9hsZ02RAdH #ExploretheMAP

@stranter Yeah there are some interesting covariates in here for sure
@stranter Specifically, here. 23.7M transactions this cycle. https://t.co/SIVGbkcXcq
@stranter Because ActBlue is a conduit, each transaction is on their report - unless they've changed their legal structure since I last checked this.
@LPDonovan It seems they both performed right as expected, whereas Gillum underperformed. But I'm taking the "fundamentals"/"deluxe" worldview, while others might be looking at this "polls only" in which case Beto modestly outperformed.
@LPDonovan Did people expect a runoff? No poll showed Abrams leading, which was the same as Beto, but she was consistently within 2 points.		Actually, all the working the refs about TX-SEN polls in mid-October probably helped Beto, in that it anchored people in post-Kav polling expectations
@stranter Actually, we all know this, since each and every single ActBlue transaction is public on the FEC website.

Alternatively: If you are going to live in elite redoubts, be conscious that you are a stereotype and tack hard in the other direction. Exist at a certain remove, note the absurdity of your surroundings, frequent places that are more downscale than the norm.
NYC/DC serve as powerful anchors for media elite mores/habits/beliefs. Even if you try to overcome them, you never fully can. Answer is not more West Virginia diner coverage, but to anchor yourself in places that are at the exact midpoint culturally.
Working within a two mile radius of Union Square NYC is prima facie evidence of bias. Even if it doesn't dictate exactly what you believe, those ZIP codes are extreme cultural outliers that erect pretty robust guardrails around what you think/believe.

@AdrienneRoyer Stats is how you prove anything! The problem is that political scientists are generally developing their theories in very data poor environments. Stats only go so far when you have dozens or hundreds of observations.

Back to the original subject, History is hugely helpful because it teaches you not to freak out as much at current events. What's happened now has usually happened before!
I do think the field has rehabilitated itself with a new breed of political scientists who deeply study campaigns and with things like the Gerber-Green field experiments, which have had a huge impact on the practice of campaigns.
Thankfully, Penn had a stellar Communications program where I heard from guest speakers like @davidaxelrod. And there were enough Poli Sci classes like this that I stuck with my major.
My advice to the youngs: Whatever your field, seek out the classes with real-life practical applications and which war-game professional situations, preferably taught by practitioners or former practitioners. These exist in politics too. In fact, I'm teaching one this semester!
History at least felt more concrete. Meanwhile, I found that political theory or comparative politics gives you absolutely no grounding for a career on campaigns, the Hill, or public policy. At best, it helps you in obscure debates over things like Maine's ranked-choice voting.
As a liberal arts major, I feel like History doesn't deserve the brunt of this treatment. I double majored in History after finding that Poli Sci was total garbage and had nothing to do with the practice of politics in the real world.

@NateSilver538 @EsotericCD Idk Gillum vs DeSantis is about as clear an expression of the current partisan divide as you’ll find
@InvidiousDist @NateSilver538 This is one way of putting it, and it’s not wrong
@NateSilver538 It has proven to be a highly optimized/arbitraged electoral college strategy and I’m not sure another Republican could have done as well on those terms. 2020 will render the final verdict but I’d say winning 296 EVs worth of states on D+8 is underwhelming.
@NateSilver538 I think the Hispanic portion of the rising American electorate theory has so far proven overrated, but the college white portion has not. That latter piece seems much more responsible for moving states into or closer to the D column (CO, VA, TX, and CA to a degree).
@NateSilver538 And I could sketch out a scenario where Hispanics become marginally more moderate as a group as they age in and older immigrants turn against new waves of immigrants.
@NateSilver538 Clearly, the lot of the recent college grads doesn't seem to be getting better over time. Having a Bachelors is not the exclusive club it once was, so it's possible they hold on to some of the properties of the "white working class" longer than previous waves of grads.
@NateSilver538 There's clearly a short term cycle of action and reaction going on. My bet is that the goalposts will keep getting shifted on what constitutes an objectively "cosmopolitan" electorate even if all those metrics keep improving.

Obama wouldn’t get tough in the Middle East because it wasn’t the Zen-like, chill thing to do. Trump won’t because he admires authoritarian strongmen. Both were wrong but Trump actually seems honest about it.

@NateSilver538 @binarybits It seems to me like Facebook has weeded out bad actors, though, and it's now run-of-the-mill partisan websites that are appearing high in these rankings. Explain to me why that is bad.
@NateSilver538 @binarybits Sure, but the incentives are such that we shouldn't reasonably expect them to act in any other way. We wouldn't demand other media platforms privilege less popular over more popular content. Imagine cable news tamping down partisanship or studios tamping down sequels/reboots.

The most compelling evidence that Democrats overperformed in Georgia due to African American turnout lies in their victory in GA-06 and near-win in GA-07. While black voters are a smaller slide of these districts, their turnout was lackluster in the GA-06 special last year.
Georgia voted at 96% of its presidential total, the second highest rate in the nation https://t.co/fTSK255mjN

@NathanWurtzel I kind of place him in the same category as Romney, someone doing his own thing who isn't interested in being defined by Trump (in contrast to Flake). Would the WH political office invest resources in a primary?
That's contingent on Never Trumpers becoming Trump-agnostic or even mildly Trump friendly. If they remain openly Trump-hostile, it doesn't matter what Trump does, they're toast in primaries. But you don't need to be uber-MAGA to win primaries either.
Earlier in the cycle, I was afraid of 2016 Trump skeptics like Ben Sasse and Lindsey Graham being toast with primary electorates in 2020. Now, I think they probably win fairly comfortably. Trump has not proven to be as retaliatory as assumed.
The one potential blemish on the Senate strategy map is forcing out Jeff Flake. But Arizona Republicans were booting Flake regardless of what Trump did or didn't do.
The only potential own-goal was elevating Ron DeSantis in FL-GOV, but this somehow worked out too! That race wasn't even as close as the Senate race, and wasn't marred by the Broward undervote issue.
The three areas where Trump seems determined to go his own way against advice are immigration, trade, and the general area of tweeting/norms. On the rest, he's perhaps more amenable to advice than your typical president would be.
Trump does not like losing, and at least as far as political targeting goes, has shown he is willing to take advice. This worked out for him.		There's an analog here to his strategy on the courts, which has paid dividends. 		When you listen to Cocaine Mitch, you win.
Not to mention being all over the Senate battlegrounds in the last few weeks. Even in MT-SEN and WV-SEN where Rs lost, the margins were very close, and in the latter, much closer than expected. (Imagine if Ohio had been added to the list!)
Trump:		✔️ Cleared the field for Dean Heller after praising Tark.	✔️ Endorsed Romney early	✔️ Stayed out of the AZ-SEN open seat primary, praised McSally, who won in a walk	✔️ Endorsed John James, a rising star	✔️ Tanked the very Trump-y Blankenship in WV-SEN
The Roy Moore debacle changed all that. He saw the damage bad candidates could do to his agenda in the Senate. He became a team player. It's probably the most convincing evidence for the "normal President" hypothesis to date. Consider...
We started out the cycle with the very real prospect of the President undermining his party and stoking primary challenges to incumbents. Even when he went to bat for "Big Luther", for example, it seemed very half-hearted.

Another thing that could be related is Catalist only having the electorate as 9% 18-29 despite the *massive* jump in turnout. It seems quite likely to me that there were more young voters but they were less Democratic.
Ah! 27 points.
To be clear, R's losing young white voters by a dozen points isn't great for them, but it's not 26 points. Everything else we've seen is more consistent with a uniform swing left among all voter groups since 2016 rather than massive shifts by age (or anything else).
The Upshot data is closer to AP VoteCast (which seems to have produced more reliable demographic estimates than the NEP exit poll), which has whites 18-29 at D+11, seniors at R+16, for a gap of 28 points. That's close to Catalist's 30 point gap in 2016. https://t.co/gpdMd0bEm8
To be sure, these were two different universes. Upshot only polled battlegrounds, Catalist looks at the nation as a whole. But the Upshot data leans further left as far as white voters go. They had whites in battlegrounds as R+8, Catalist had them as R+14 nationwide.
The Catalist assertion that there was a 52-point age gap from seniors to millennials isn't really supported by pre-election Upshot microdata, which shows a more normal 23-point gap. In Upshot polling, white 18-29's were D+12, white seniors were R+11. https://t.co/YTqzcWu2J0

@DanRosenheck That might explain his vote share gains, but the turnout composition shifts are interesting as well.
And that's probably why 1) it looks like there will be a 2-point polling error on the generic ballot favoring Republicans, 2) why district results were extremely formulaic and predictable (nearly perfect partisan sorting with the baseline shifted 6 points left).
It's also why you should treat with extreme caution arguments that more people voting helps Democrats. Clearly not in OH-12. If Dems are already amped up in terms of turnout, higher turnout will on the margins help the lower turnout groups (e.g. Republicans).
There are lessons here that are generalizable to future cycles in forecasting generals based on special elections. Special elections will definitely tell you the partisan lean of turnout, but they'll likely be a more extreme measure than the final outcome.
@SonOfWhit Last Tuesday was clearly a Blue Wave. But I care about things like the precise partisan lean of turnout in every election.
Turnout in OH-12 last Tuesday wasn't quite as good for Republicans as 2016. But it was better for them than the special election. And Balderson generally increased his vote share, especially in Franklin County, suggesting that even in suburban counties more Republicans voted.
OH-12 tells the story of how last Tuesday's turnout wasn't as bad for Republicans as the special elections. Turnout in the suburban parts of the district surged 58% from the special. But turnout in rural/GOP areas surged 76%. https://t.co/nYcdVcNXTT

@NathanWurtzel Right, they were single voices within much larger outlets. But there was never a *major outlet* solely devoted to this as a cultural driving force.
@BenjySarlin Nah, I'd say they've been focused on it. People are writing about it now because they won the election. 		Rs did better at this in 2010 when their base was motivated, but I would say that they didn't fully capitalize it to the degree Dems have.
@brianros1 Which shows the limits of grassroots organizing to overcome basic partisan leanings - and why Rs may be right to focus on things upstream of elections!
@NathanWurtzel I think our own work together in the past has shown that this is not really an organizational problem. When the base is motivated, they give.
@NathanWurtzel Good luck getting Charlie Kirk to move off "own-the-libs"-ism!
The conservative grassroots has decided its core competency is going to be bracketing the media rather than elections. This is a valid strategic choice. And this is one logical consequence of it.

*This is NOT a platform problem.* And it's not a problem that will be solved in DC.

@LizMair Far right nationalism is problematic for a number of reasons—but it’s largely not directed at stirring up national hatred against neighboring countries. Needing the EU to stop another war has always struck me as superstitious.
The United States may be the only country that can safely discard nationalism, because we were founded on a set of ideals, not geographical coordinates. The European countries still need nationalism as a bulwark against the greater evil of supra-nationalism.
My homeboy Emmanuel Macron would do well to remember all the times nationalism was a bulwark again tyranny—communism and imperialism alike

It’s so lazy to say “ActBlue” instead of “online fundraising.” The problem is that some people don’t have online fundraising. That’s a function of enthusiasm.
@hodgesmr @SenhorRaposa @rudnicknoah @LPDonovan Like I think their know-how and experience and scale makes a difference at the margins. But this was an enthusiasm election. The scale is driven first and foremost by enthusiasm, not tactics.
@OriginalBad @SenhorRaposa @rudnicknoah @LPDonovan There were actually efforts to spread the money away from Beto. I think the pod bros did something. But I’d argue this wasn’t aggressive enough.

@SenhorRaposa @rudnicknoah @LPDonovan There's a larger point too about what the impact of all this money is after you've reached the saturation point. Beto &amp; Heitkamp had tons of money. It'd have been better if they'd spread that money to Likely R seats like Kenny Marchant's. https://t.co/vlwtU0H2AC
@SenhorRaposa @rudnicknoah @LPDonovan If you want to argue that "fired up grassroots Dem donors" made a difference, sure. But the specific tech matters less. Case in point, in 2010, I was taking over operations for candidates who had raised $40k into a PayPal overnight because their opponent cast a bad vote.
@SenhorRaposa @rudnicknoah @LPDonovan The main difference is that there isn't a monopoly on the Republican side. People can judge for themselves whether that's good or bad. But the nature of the payment processing platform to me doesn't make a huge difference in the amount that can be raised.
@SenhorRaposa @rudnicknoah @LPDonovan 11 years after, the comment still holds true and the misunderstanding continues. ActBlue isn't fundamentally unique - it's a payment processor. There are lots of those, on both sides. There are even lots of Republican companies who have mimicked ActBlue's "wallet" functionality.
This is excellent work, but given the historic high turnout I kind of wonder why the 18-29 vote didn't surge more, to like halfway between a normal midterm and a presidential. At least you'd think this was happening given all the youth early vote reports. https://t.co/Ze6yFSFa7V

@bricey16 Raw vote totals are a meaningless number that may give a false sense of security in a surging turnout environment. I'd prefer to just give people vote share and electoral composition estimates.
What's really important though is to have realistic, hyper-localized vote share estimates
@happycycling03 The states are just the country in microcosm.
I do them, but I've always found the traditional concept of "vote goals" kind of silly because the size of the turnout is inherently unknowable. On the Bush campaign we had a vote goal of 55 million and we got 62 million. If we'd just hit our vote goal we'd have lost big.
A lot of people missed on the size of the turnout, but it probably didn't hurt polling accuracy much for folks who already had higher Democratic turnout baked in as a prior from the special elections.
Obviously, the highest turnout (relative to '16) came in states that were very competitive in '18 but not competitive in '16. Here's what the '16 to '18 dropoff looks like in those states. https://t.co/T5PL8ylGmI
Turnout as a % of '16 for the following types of states: 		Not Competitive in '16 / Competitive in '18 - 87%	Not Competitive in '16 / Not Competitive in '18 - 77%		Competitive in '16 / Competitive '18 - 83%	Competitive in '16 / Not Competitive in '18 - 82%

In seats contested both years, 2018 House results were more correlated to 2016 Presidential results, at .96, than *2016* House results were, at .93.
Only three clear outliers stand out as being in districts utterly unmatched for their party: David Valadao (CA-21) which is still counting, Collin Peterson (MN-7), and Matt Cartwright (PA-8). But the rest of it tells a story of partisan sorting with the baseline shifted left.

@JHagner Good catch! 		(This is what DDHQ has, so they may not have caught up.)
@AlexanderBrunk Possibly so. But that seemed to have its own uniquely polarized dynamic. Plus I don't think Texas qualifies as a blowout state like, say, MO or IN would. Same could be said of Arizona.
But this doesn't mean they'll be right in 2020. Be vigilant.
This doesn't seem to apply to pure tossups, but to lean races in safe states. Once a candidate has opened up a small advantage, voters tend to give them the W.
A good heuristic prediction of polling error is that when a party's candidate is leading slightly in a state with a decided partisan skew in their favor, they tend to win by more than the polls predicted.		MO, IN, NJ fit the bill for this in 2018.	AR, KY fit the bill in 2014.

For analytics to work, you need a good scout to tell you where to point your analytical resources. This is the unique role that @redistrict and all the ratings services play. And this was the problem with the Clinton targeting effort in 2016 - pointing in the wrong place.
It did feel like there was a nice division of labor between different analysts, each focusing on what they did well instead of everyone competing on forecasts. FiveThirtyEight and Cook did a better job because they had such a high quality polling source (the Upshot) &amp; vice versa. https://t.co/x7TvKFsgY5
Remember - all of this is subject to change once California finishes counting in 3 years, but for now, this looks like a massive win for the Upshot polls and the forecasts.
In the 28 districts the Upshot polled rated by Cook as tossups, they nailed the margin to within 0.5%.
In tossup and lean Dem seats, the Upshot's final polls were exactly on the nose. In lean R seats, they underestimated Democrats by 2.9 points. https://t.co/T1QpGV4ug7
FiveThirtyEight hit Dem performance on the nose in tossup/leaning seats, but underestimated Republican vote share in safe districts. https://t.co/buou7JDujl
@simonowens This is partisanship, not analysis.
Mean absolute error in The Crosstab estimates for Cook tossup or leaning districts was 9.4%, but these seem to have canceled each other out given the model's overall strong correlation with results.
The mean error in the 538 model goes down to 3.2 points in seats rated by Cook as tossups or leaning. And the Upshot mean error in these districts was 3.6 points - pretty good for only being one data source.
Mean absolute error in best performing 538 "Deluxe" model: 6.7% - but remember this includes a lot of safe seats with wide margins.
@simonowens Yes, where one side gets to exclusively define what "voter suppression" is
Mean absolute error in the final Upshot House polls: 3.7%.
@simonowens Voter suppression is the Democrats’ version of Obamaphones. We had record breaking turnout throughout the country and in Georgia.
Here's an updated model bake-off. The correlation between winner and estimated probabilities:		538 Deluxe .950	538 Polls Only .943	Crosstab / @gelliottmorris .940	538 Classic .937	DDHQ .922
In the average district, we have seen a swing of 6.7% to the Democrats off the 2016 Presidential margin.
With 98 million votes counted, Republicans in the House are running ahead of the 538 model by 1.8%. A regression model would predict a 219D-216R based on this, so the fact that Dems have won more seats mean district-specific campaign effects helped them.

@simonowens Better turnout has generally been correlated with being a northerly state with a lot of white, educated voters.
@Nate_Cohn Right, I'm trying to read tea leaves for a *historic* turnout (e.g. up 20-25% from 2014 nationwide).
But CO was extremely competitive in the Senate in 2014, and the statewide elections have been seen as less competitive. Still, a reminder that turnout gains will not be evenly distributed.
One piece of evidence for there not being a turnout boom (in all states). While we've seen cases in specials of turnout exceeding past midterm turnout by 25%, Colorado is currently running 8% above its 2014 number. https://t.co/g5mwNvqV0A

While biased in the sense that they only polled battlegrounds (which lean more right!) this dataset is likely to be the best we will have about this election. There's no substitute for tens of thousands of interviews rigorously weighted and gathered using gold standard methods.
Trump approval across the Republican coalition ranges from 75% for nonwhite women to 92% for non-college white men.		Within the Democratic coalition, it ranges from &lt;4% with college white women to 15% for non-college white men.

Whether or not this is a notable shift from 2016 depends on what data source you look at. If exits (problematic for a host of reasons), then this is a collapse with the white working class. If using Catalist's estimates, it's more a uniform shift among whites. https://t.co/NEohd2mpXV
White women with a college degree: D+15	White women without a college degree: R+8	Nonwhite women: D+37		White men with a college degree: R+9	White men without a college degree: R+27	Nonwhite men: D+17
On the named ballot:		Whites with a college degree: D+4	Whites without a college degree: R+17	Nonwhites: D+28
This narrows slightly to 20 points (D+10 among women and R+10 among men) on the named House ballots.

What’s interesting is that he’s done it as an unabashed progressive and hasn’t tried to tailor his message for the state (he hasn’t paid for polling). 		This sort of begs the question of whether a Bredesen-like Dem could have actually gotten the job done in this race. https://t.co/LtxuJz0i0f
So, on Tuesday night, we’re likely to be saying things like, “Dems really crushed it in rich suburbs” or “Trumpy districts really came home at the end” — or both!
We can learn a lot from *how* we’ve been wrong in the past. It’s usually a matter of underestimating a trend that was evident in pre-election polls that actually comes out much stronger than people assumed they would — like the Obama-to-Trump white working class swing.
A sensible default posture is conventional wisdom + humility instead of conventional wisdom + certainty — rather than rashly placing outlier bets*		* Unless this is for an office pool, then that makes sense as a betting strategy
Politics is like Hollywood: “Nobody knows nothing about anything.” 		The campaigns in tossup races don’t know who’s going to win. That’s why they’re focused on turning out every vote right now, not engaging in navel gazing.
Given that we are now in a moment of feverish speculation, this feels important to say: For all the hate thrown at polls/punditry, *we really don’t have any tools better than the polls/forecasts* to tell us which way things will go on Tuesday.
@NateSilver538 So bet on a Dem wave
@cage0056 But science
Has anyone done a comparison of the GA-6 early vote from the midterm to the special — and also done this for other special elections? This would be a rare good use case for early voting data.
A good idea would be in the last 72 hours to conduct an “insiders poll” of muckety-mucks asking them which direction they expect the polling error to go in, then bet on the opposite happening

@tbonier I do! But because of generically higher turnout and higher interest in the election that will also bring out Republican constituencies who have been comparatively less likely to vote so far this cycle.
How much was youth turnout up in the early days of GA-6 special election voting as opposed to the past midterm? This would be a useful bit of context.
@kimmurphy100 @asmamk No but it’s what’s likely to happen
@tbonier Turnout among all groups does not increase equally in the transition from a low to a high turnout environment!
@tbonier Do you know how turnout scores work bro? 😉
If turnout in this election looks like a hybrid of Presidential and midterm turnout the following things will happen:		1) Youth turnout will be way up	2) Turnout among pro-Trump constituencies (WWC) and Republicans who sat out special elections will also be up. https://t.co/VaICjMFHWD
@jon_m_rob Huh? In relative terms people at the low end have the biggest percentage increase in their turnout rates. Your data shows the biggest movement from midterm to presidential years among young voters.
There’s a voter surge, but we won’t know if there’s a youth voter surge until we have a chance to review voter files for this election. This is a case of wanting to be overly specific with a finding and losing the bigger picture.
These reports need to be placed within the context of higher turnout overall. If turnout goes up, turnout among the most unlikely voters will go up much more. https://t.co/cltN093BmL

@jro (Oh man, nothing is as triggering to Ds this cycle as this whole voter suppression thing. It's like bringing up Merrick Garland in 2016.)
We don't need the early vote to tell us that turnout will break all records. We know it from the GA-6 runoff (June 2017) and the Virginia Governor's race (November 2017).
@jro Both W and Trump were folksy and had a blue collar, anti-elitist vibe to their campaigns, something the other two never managed to pull off as well. Actual wealth is not the relevant distinction here.
@jro Obama was smart and I think he knew to play up his opponents plutocratic streaks (I never heard about McCain's 7 homes before or after the 2008 campaign). As a result I think they underperformed what a Republican could have done in the Rust Belt.

It's not that you're lying, it's that you're telling half the truth. My whataboutism is merely an attempt to point out the other half of the truth, that everyone truly is horrible until proven otherwise.
I think Kavanaugh and the seeming movement of the Senate battleground has recalibrated people's expectations that the GOP is maybe more competitive than it actually is in the House, when in fact we seem to be exactly where we were when it all started.
Here's a slight update, and future versions should be consistent with this. If anything, this highlights how the entirety of the Kavanaugh nomination process (from the New Yorker allegations forward) energized the GOP, and how quickly the effect wore off. https://t.co/n3GyzQZ3v5

The standard 15% commission on TV buys works out to around $340 million for calendar year 2018 so far.
For political ads in 2018 so far, we've seen...		$2.1B on broadcast TV	$180M+ on cable TV	$308M on Facebook	$53M on Google		That's no less than 16% on digital, and probably slightly higher, considering undisclosed smaller platforms.

@jon_m_rob @nickgourevitch @Civiqs I did a tweetstorm last year looking at their pre- to post-election waves that showed Johnson voters (and most undecideds) breaking to Trump.
@daveweigel @LizMair I think this may play out differently when the question is awarding citizenship vs. locking kids up in cages. But I also expect support to go down *by a few points* just because Trump came out for it.
@jon_m_rob @nickgourevitch @Civiqs At least that's what CCES shows.
@jon_m_rob @nickgourevitch @Civiqs I think you can probably chalk up the (meaningless!) 1 point national polling error in 2016 to normal third party overestimate and Johnson voters breaking 2-1 for Trump.

@nolesfan2011 Correct — the people offended by Trump are mostly privileged whites
@DanRosenheck @jon_m_rob The thing is that most of this has already been captured by polls, which generally tend to overestimate turnout anyway
@DanRosenheck @jon_m_rob Turnout is just more elastic on the bottom end of the range. So if partisan reactions to Trump move your typical Dem from .5 to .6, let’s say, a generic turnout boost is going to get out the remaining Republicans (plus some young people and Indy’s for sure)
@jon_m_rob *two words
Everything in the early vote is consistent with turnout being HIGH. That's not terrible for Republicans because higher overall enthusiasm brings their marginal voters out, whereas Democrats would have voted regardless. See GA-6 first round vs. runoff.

@ianpatrickhines Exactly.
The only social network that isn't a flaming garbage heap is Instagram which has Likes but no re-sharing feature.
If a friend posts a selfie or a baby pic, you Like it, to show THEM you like it, but may not think it's relevant to most of your readers, so you don't retweet it. 		Retweeting is more specifically tailored to the partisan echo chamber. You retweet messages you want to spread.
I can't see how this has anything to do with conversational health. A Like is usually a way to signal appreciation for funny inside jokes and personal stuff, where as militant partisan tweets generally have a better retweet to like ratio.
I assume getting rid of the like button has something to do with people using it instead of the retweet button, and this tanking Twitter's engagement metrics.

@mazurkr I’m against WY’s extreme purges (of all previous general election voters) because we need to be able to target non-voters. I’m generally fine with same day voter registration coupled with voter ID.
@mazurkr I am personally happy to compete under any set of rules. If some Republicans think this hurts them, that’s wrong and short-sighted. My only bias is towards high quality voter lists—so some form of voter reg (no ND) and reasonable purges from time to time.
In most big city precincts, the only people who run for these offices are Democrats which means that the only precinct poll workers (by default) are Democrats. 		Google “Carlos Matos” for a sense of the kind of people overseeing elections in the city of Philadelphia.
Fun story — the only elected office I ever held (and likely will hold) was as the Republican inspector of elections in my college precinct in Philly.		I was nominated with a single vote in the primary when the student population was away for the summer.
Where I do think election laws create bias are in heavily industrial “machine” states — think New York and Pennsylvania — through archaic ballot access rules, restrictions on early voting and elected precinct poll workers (in the PA case)
Election administration in the US is actually extremely nonpartisan, driven by civil servants at the state and county levels. Ask them, and they’ll tell you that paranoia about widespread voter fraud is unwarranted — and so too about voter suppression.
It has never been easier to vote, and spreading the falsehood that it is hard to vote depresses voter turnout. 		In fact, early voting was pioneered by heavily Republican Sun Belt states, while heavily Democratic states like New York remain stuck in the past. https://t.co/apu1Edw8kJ

@williamjordann Non-party reg states do seem to be a source of randomness in the estimates for sure
@jipkin The problem is that prediction markets just like handicappers are a derivative measure that just reacts to polls.
There’s a case to be made that the House outcome is not that uncertain at this point — helped by the Upshot’s polling blitz. 		But this could easily cut the other way if they’re wrong.
That’s in contrast to idiosyncratic state behavior in the Senate or at the presidential level, not to mention the outsized consequence if you get one big state wrong vs. one House race vs. a handful.
Historically—there have not been huge surprises in the House like we’ve seen at the Presidential level. The large n-size does seem to keep vast seat movements relative to expectations in check.
On the flip side: Does this make our assessment of the House battleground more accurate than in previous cycles? 75% of the battleground has had some polling thus far, and it’s easy to count up potential gains/losses with hard data without reliance on forecasts.
It would be good to have a more diverse set of pollsters trying a diverse set of methods. But it seems like few have the budget or the stomach for this.
It’s not just the polls themselves, but the handicappers, who are basically mostly just responding to polls at this point. So polls—and especially the Upshot’s—count double in any forecast that uses both.
I say this as the #1 fan of the project. As I’m sure even @Nate_Cohn will acknowledge, his modeling choices (which are correct imo) are having an outsized impact on perceptions of the state of play across the battleground.
Because the Upshot has become *so dominant* in terms of district polling — they’re 5-10x as prolific as the next closest independent pollster — when do we start to worry about forecasts being too dependent on a single source like this?
Contingent on them not screwing up this round of crossings like the last one, we should all have enough objectivity and self-awareness to understand that this issue helps Trump in the midterms.

@willfnye Also a healthy antidote to extreme partisan polarization that deserves more attention! VT, MD and MA are deep blue states that will go Republican in a Blue Wave. And Rs struggling in some deep red bastions.
The lack of attention given to Governors races (except for FL &amp; GA) is one of the major oversights of midterm coverage. OH, NV, WI, and KS are all tossups with big personalities and/or '20 implications and are hugely under-covered.
An additional 4 seats rated as tossups are unpolled (Upshot seems not to be polling in Siena's backyard, specifically NY-19 &amp; NY-22), and additional 17 are Lean R. Assuming a win rate of 50% in the tossups and 20% in the Lean Rs, Ds could reasonably expect a net pickup of 6 more.
By my count, the latest New York Times and Monmouth polls show Dems leading in 24 GOP-held seats (and GOP ahead in 1 D-held seat) in addition to 4 R-held seats rated as Likely Dem. That's a net pickup of 27 from polls alone.

I'm by nature not a late in the cycle optimist, but I will say this: having lived through 2006, the closing stretch of that cycle was a real dumpster fire for the GOP compared to 2018. You had scandal after scandal popping up through Election Day: Ney, DeLay, Foley, macaca, etc.

Income inequality is due primarily to the growing economic rents sought by educated professionals in big cities, a group that has swung strongly Democratic in recent years.		Because of this, it’s going to be increasingly difficult for Democrats to push redistribution.
@TerryMoran Because they’re pragmatic and results oriented, which is exactly my argument!
Politics is a perfectly efficient market with a stable equilibrium between the left 48-52% and the right 48-52%. If views change, the parties simply will move on to other issues to maintain the equilibrium.
50%+ coalitions inherently don’t make sense. If you want your coalition to make sense, you’re playing for 46 to 48%.

Everything that’s happening now has happened before. The idea that we’re living through something unique and unprecedented is one of the most overrated ideas out there.
Corrosive tribalism in America is nothing new—except now the tribe is party and not race.
Everyone is a process hypocrite. Debates about process are play-acting and nothing more—and therefore uninteresting and not worth engaging in.
Political campaigns are the ultimate battles of will. Voters can suss out who’s hustlin’ and who isn’t.

Successful presidential campaigns need to have a blue collar, not a white collar, vibe. This is a useful heuristic for knowing who is going to win.
Nate Cohn is a great pollster. That’d because he’s possibly the best campaign polling methodology person out there.
The main thing Nate Silver is right about is uncertainty. Even if you think the rest of his premises are wrong, his focus on uncertainty makes him mostly right.
An arbitrary focus on the incumbent being over/under 50 is hocus pocus
Self-reported likelihood to vote and intensity questions are mostly hocus pocus garbage
High turnout independents are not good persuasion targets. Focus on low-turnout independents instead. See “persuasion and turnout are the same thing”
The fact that the electorate is largely agnostic on policy means you should usually ignore polls when crafting policy. A well-liked incumbent has wide running room in pushing through unpopular policies.
Who wins national elections has never been about an ideological preference by the electorate for one side over the other but is solely determined by 1) perceptions of incumbent party performance and 2) candidate quality/personality.
Democrats won’t win more votes if voting is made easier or turnout expands, but this will make the electorate more susceptible to populism.
Trump’s victory in 2016 is evidence of a hard “eight years and out” rule for party control of the presidency. There’s no precedent for an incumbent losing in a (perceived) good economy after four years due to other factors.
In Presidential elections, warm beats cold. Presidential contests are decided by personality, not policy.
The best Democratic message in 2020 is that Trump hasn’t drained the swamp or focused enough on helping working people over the wealthy.
A focus on culture and identity politics and not economics is the best way for the right to improve its electoral prospects in the future. The left seems more than willing to oblige them in this.
The evidence that either voter fraud or voter suppression has a widespread effect on election results is nil.
Someone winning the Presidency with supermajorities in large states like California and New York is exactly the scenario the Founding Fathers were looking to prevent when they instituted the Electoral College.
African American and Hispanic Democrats play a key moderating role, reining in the hare-brained schemes of the white progressive left.
Persuasion and turnout are the same thing.
Trump is a normal President doing normal things except for the tweets.

There is almost certainly some GOP response bias going on, but given the poor state of party information on the file in Minnesota, it's not something you can control for that well.
Running a model on the individual responses (trained on data from when the first MN08 poll was taken), showed responses in that second poll that leaned 4 points to the right of the first poll. (But probably not double digits to the right.)
Here's a fun example how even with the best data this stuff can be hard.		Let's look at #MN08 - in their second poll, which showed Stauber +15, the sample was much more Republican than in the first poll. 		Yet, modeled party (which was almost certainly weighted for) was the same https://t.co/P70cmheVf7

@DanRosenheck NYT district polling has been more favorable to Rs and R and D internal pollsters also reporting the same trends.
One way to sort all this out: NYT has been posting the results of all their different LV models. For their final polls, we'll get to see which one was closest to the mark (though that too may be an election-specific finding not generalizable to the future!)
This is why using them aggressively as screens and dumping people entirely from surveys as a result is bad practice, imo. They should be weighted down in a probablistic LV model, not excluded.
Even if they're right directionally, they may suffer from the problem of being "right for the wrong reasons." We don't know enough about the mechanism through which self-reported intensity on a survey relates to actual turnout, beyond just a rough correlation.
Generally speaking, aggressive likely voter screens usually paint a too-optimistic picture for the "enthusiastic" side.
To give an example, men (who report being more certain about anything you may ask in a survey) generally report higher levels of enthusiasm &amp; voting overall than women, but women vote at higher rates. In 2016, we saw high black voter enthusiasm in polls that didn't materialize.
Self-reported turnout screens are noisy, inexact behavioral measures. If you don't use a voter file, I'm not sure how would use them alone to back into the kind of estimate you would get from vf-based model (which would be more accurate).
If you think that surge is real, to actually matter it will have to convert to at least 10-15% higher GOP turnout which Dems have already achieved and would be a monumental achievement if true.		One precedent for this: 2004, when everyone's turnout levels jumped, GOP moreso.
In special elections, Democratic surges has involved turnout surges of 15-20% or more among their base while Republicans stayed steady. And Republican turnout hasn't been bad - it's matched 2014 when they won.
That's why it's difficult to evaluate claims of a GOP enthusiasm surge as such. We have no evidence for it in any special election we could use to train a model. But if the surge is real, it will show up in topline results as it has for multiple pollsters of the last week.
With these turnout models, I would argue that special election (&amp; where we have it - regular general election turnout) is a pretty good predictor of midterm turnout but this is hugely variable on political environment. NJ was ho-hum, VA off the chart great for Dems.
But don't we have voter files? Yes, yes, we do. The problem is that the turnout models most readily available to pollsters (who don't have their own modeling in-house) may not predict *this election's* turnout very well &amp; are subject to the whims of the data firm that built them
A good rule of thumb, if you're doing likelihood to vote on a 1-to-10 scale, is that something like 80% of your 10's will actually vote, and 50% of everyone else will actually vote. There's not a strong correlation between 1-9 ratings and voting, but there is with a 10.
Self-reported intensity is correlated with actual turnout but the two are not the same. 		People lie, lie, lie on likely voter screens. Not a majority, mind you, but enough to cast some doubt on them.

2016 also saw a redrawing of the House/Senate map along Trumpy lines even as Republicans like Pat Toomey overperformed Trump in the suburbs. This is what enabled them to win the House popular vote. And it’s probably why you don’t see Republicans in the main running from Trump.

Let me ask a question about Beto's money. #TXSEN hasn't really been in the top races in terms of ad spending. Where is it all going?
@MelissaTweets Jay-Z and Bey a little classier than Kanye
Jacket and tie is the only proper attire in the Oval tho
Not really being overly bothered by either is the intellectually honest and correct take.
No, there really is no way to reconcile the hypocrisy of blasting this but cheering Kanye in the Oval. https://t.co/R8dY6y943z

(Yes, I'm shamelessly trolling to get HRC's number released. They released this gladly after both Obama campaigns but so far as I know were mum on HRC's total raised online.)
Beto is probably going to raise more money online than Hillary did!
@JHagner Obama? Sanders?
@jaypinho This assumes all men are "men's rights activists", all women are feminists (traditionally defined), etc. This is demonstrably false in the data.
Showing my cards here, and not all may agree: I'm so exhausted about hearing about identity politics - from both the left and the right. Even if we aren't where we need to be as a country, obsessing over race and gender divides us and increases backlash.

If we could have 20% less media polls in October so we could have 300% more media polls in the spring the public would be no worse off.
FACT: The public probably knows too much about where Senate races stand in October, and not enough about where they stand in April, May, and June.
@DaveNyczepir Four years ago, liberals were touting the "Blue Wall" as a desirable strategic advantage magnifying the impact of Democratic popular votes in the Electoral College. Forgive me if I think this sudden posturing about the Electoral College is disingenuous.

@BenjySarlin If we aren’t going to do anything we might as well swap out the people not doing things to keep things interesting
Having a strategy to fight your way out of the elite ghetto is more interesting than elite groupthink like		Trump was unthinkable. 	The public is actually pretty woke.	Everyone will be for the NFL players in 20 years.	Beto is a thing. 	Abolishing ICE and the Senate is a thing.
The fact that you're elite or an expert on anything makes you weird. 		That creates serious obstacles to convincing the public to do what you want.		Actually recognizing this means you'll adopt more nuanced and clever strategies of persuasion.
I'm sometimes saucy like this because I think it would be healthy for people in media, academia, and tech to realize that most people aren't only not like them - they're in fact the exact opposite.
@BenjySarlin That’s not only true of immigration, but a range of things.
@BenjySarlin That’s pretty much it. 		People think the system is a total mess — and they want to keep it.

@KSoltisAnderson Views of immigration from different regions, by party &amp; race.		Fascinating implication: There may not be inter-group solidarity in how different groups see other immigrants.		Whites, Hispanics and blacks are 10 points more favorable towards immigrants of the same background https://t.co/o2AJWY9Tbd
@KSoltisAnderson There are vast differences of opinion on whether we should have more immigration overall, and from different parts of the world. https://t.co/dbxi3xzxGK
@KSoltisAnderson On the whole, Republicans and Trump supporters do care quite a bit more about the issue. Here's the distribution of immigration support scores by how important people ranked the issue. https://t.co/sU3a35LPXW
That's why studying young Republicans is so important! cc @KSoltisAnderson
There's a fascinating divide within the parties. Here, respondents are scored based on their answers to all immigration questions.		If you're a Republican, being younger makes you much more pro-immigration. If you're a Democrat, having a college degree makes you pro-immigration. https://t.co/ImosMCRK3e
When you control for partisanship or ideology, younger age and higher education have an effect in making you more pro-immigration.		What's surprising is that race and ethnicity have basically no effect. Hispanics are not more pro-immigration than their partisanship suggests.
@DemocracyFund Demographically, young people, the college educated, and African Americans hold the most pro-immigration views. That's not surprising given the partisanship of these groups. https://t.co/MOkhfa5XBF
@DemocracyFund NERDY TWEET: Immigration was always somewhat partisan, but it wasn't always THIS partisan. The correlation between immigration attitudes and partisanship has grown in the Trump era. https://t.co/xO7fm5eRN9
@DemocracyFund But not every immigration issue is so divisive! Lots of Republicans agree with legal status for illegal immigrants and DREAMers. That puts more of them in the middle on immigration, as this distribution of their overall attitudes shows. https://t.co/z4CDZlctot https://t.co/Jk9PAOkmYp
@DemocracyFund Some questions - especially the question of whether illegal immigrants contribute which is divided right down the middle - are extremely polarized politically.		On only one issue question in the VSG data - NFL kneeling - were people more divided by party. https://t.co/Fdc8N5GVUH
@DemocracyFund Attitudes towards immigration are varied and complex, ranging from +44 for the pro-immigration side to -21.		People overwhelmingly agree that legal immigrants contribute &amp; with legal status for DREAMers, but don't think it should be easier to immigrate. https://t.co/amZCfS4dgl
Immigration is one of the fascinating cultural and social issues of our time. I grapple with what the public thinks of it in this new @DemocracyFund Voter Study Group Paper. Answer? It's complicated! https://t.co/z4CDZlctot

@ggreeneva We get it — Austin is weird. But Texas isn’t Austin.
@jonathanchait Right but what does it say that Beto is losing on “resentment”
See, even Peter understands that the conservative brand is stronger than the liberal brand. This is why they try to brand themselves another way (progressive) and try to brand conservatives as something else. https://t.co/Q7EiVCBluP
Liberals may win some elections from time to time, but they play a subordinate role in guiding the moods and passions of the average American.
Beto is and has always been fanfic. The sooner we all realize this the better.		America is fundamentally conservative — something enshrined by the United States Constitution — and Texas especially so.
@TimCameron You mean NowThis can’t swing an election in Texas?
🎵 Never gonna be President now 🎵
It’s Beto’s unfavs that are the killer here. For so long the excuse was that he’d take the lead once his name ID and ad money kicked in. It has — but his image numbers are going in the wrong direction. https://t.co/1HbrU3E08R
2020 feels like an 18-car pileup for Democrats because so many of them were too afraid to challenge Hillary. Someone on this list could have been the nominee in ‘16 and beaten Trump. Many will now see their ambitions snuffed out by the glut of candidates. https://t.co/4Fb7dtjFiM
Ted Cruz will have been the only person to have beaten Donald Trump in multiple elections AND the Messiah.		Amazing.
Given the other unfortunate connotations, I will not be changing my display name to Patrick Boofini for Halloween.

Beto the great savior’s favorability rate stands at -3. 		Ted Cruz is +11.
Most eye-opening thing about the Texas poll is not the margin (which we can argue about till the cows come home) but just how *bad* Beto’s favorable ratings are. https://t.co/vo2HYvJSW3
Puerto Rico as a state would be like Alaska on steroids. You can't simply transpose your mainland partisan heuristics to reliably predict who they'd elect.
*Whispers* Intensity questions are half real, half pseudoscientific gobbledygook
The value of an op-ed column as a predictor of how things will go is pretty limited given that the number of people who have the same thought process as op-ed columnists is vanishingly small.
@jon_m_rob @kwcollins @MasabuAida He’s not my cup of tea. 		Of course this comes back to racism - it always does!
@aedwardslevy This could be surprising or it could be people rationalizing their own behavior
@DanRosenheck Which could be statistical noise hence the importance of focusing on the trendline!
But if losses are being compensated by gains among men, this trend becomes a nothinburger electorally https://t.co/31rQErc5Yj
@kwcollins @jon_m_rob @MasabuAida Regardless, I’ve always wanted but never got around to creating a Judgmental Maps of consulting firm HQ locations. 		Old Town was going to be “should have retired in 1995” but then I moved there.
@kwcollins @jon_m_rob @MasabuAida You want to be near your clients. Unions create enough of a critical mass in DC plus I assume all young Dem staff live in the city. Unless your clientele is mostly public affairs, locating in VA for GOPers makes sense given taxes and commute.
@kwcollins @jon_m_rob @MasabuAida Or maybe because some bigshots like Viguerie or Wirthlin started the trend and others copied. 		It does seem like Dems cluster downtown — which is insane to me given rents — and I always assumed this was a function of the unions.
@kwcollins @jon_m_rob @MasabuAida He’s leaving us hanging here! Didn’t know this started in one year specifically or where they were before. Always assumed this was bc Northern Virginia used to be quite conservative at the presidential level and most Republicans still live there, so it’s convenient.
@sfcpoll @ktumulty @voxdotcom 1992 is where it gets confusing. Was it 4 points (Clinton) or 0 points (HW Bush). Or we could compare margins and say it’s 5 points. Or if you prefer the other scale, divide in half to get 2. https://t.co/8GsuocMoUf
The Clinton comment is like the Cuomo comment saying America isn’t great. When you’re not a true progressive, you have to amp up your outlandish partisan commentary to compensate. https://t.co/Yvx5NumYY3
Given that this is only being released in the second week of October, this is highly likely to be BS https://t.co/f4bWBkBL1M
Proofing! https://t.co/n58SBwj3Xo
@sfcpoll @ktumulty @voxdotcom I deal mostly in terms of swings, and so yes, that's my preferred method. But I'm not sure if the traditional approach accounts as well for undecideds or years with a big third party vote.
@ktumulty @voxdotcom Well if Wikipedia says!
@ktumulty @voxdotcom It's expressing exactly the same thing, one number is usually just double the other one. 		Why I think comparing margin makes sense is because women tend to have a higher undecided rate, so their absolute preference for either party will be artificially low.
