Wait.  Did I just propose using the #ElectroPersuader #AI program to build a movement capable of erecting institutional safeguards to protect us from the possible malign influence of the #ElectroPersuader #AI program?  What a paradox.
Maybe #RoboPAC, using #ElectroPersuader, could convince the voters to support both #ElectronicSignatureGathering &amp; a federal Department of #AI, #Robotics, &amp; #QuantumComputing, as well as a #NationalInitiativeProcess.  All #RoboPAC needs now are financial contributions from fans.
We need a federal Department of #AI, #Robotics, &amp; #QuantumComputing to regulate programs like #ElectroPersuader, and we need a #NationalInitiativeProcess featuring #ElectronicSignatureGathering that would allow us to legislate such an entity into existence.
The #ElectroPersuader will use a combination of #Google’s #Duplex &amp; #IBM’s #Debater, coupled with available #VoterDatabases and #DeepLearning #algorithms, to sway #PublicOpinion on a 1-to-1 basis, according to the preferences of the entity paying for the service.

@rat_race @CouchsurfingOri convinced me that PR will always have a role, but I still think twittering/other social media will democratize it
@couchsurfingOri  what about clearing Intellectual Property Rights from all the twitters? and I'd need to make a deal with Twitter's owners
@couchsurfingori you want to handle the PR for it?
@couchsurfingori points taken.  what about a reality program based on twittering for mass broadcasting via cable with embedded video ads?
@CouchSurfingOri newspapers will always be newspapers, but the web has obsolesced them.  Won't social media do the same to PR?
@rat_race these posts on PR convince me that twittering will soon replace most PR functions, especially branding, sooner rather than later
