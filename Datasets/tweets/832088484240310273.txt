@Chris_09765 @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Can someone pass that word on to them?
#History 101. The Republican and Democrat parties used to be a single political party, with some conservative and some liberal views. Much like today's libertarian party.
@SassyKadiK @GBTHEUSA 46% of people polled does not equal 46% of all voters.		I could get 90% trump support if I called only known supporters.
I never thought about it in a way of controlled chaos. https://t.co/EPlH4dGfII
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Realistically, they should be searching any possible act of corruption or treason, regardless of party.
@TeaPainUSA Hush money is bribery. From the position of president, it is a high crime.
@jenniferm_q I think I'm the youngest candidate so far and I feel like I fit into #OldWhiteMen2020 some days.
@GBTHEUSA If it's me, I can assuredly say that it will not.		A president should have respect for the office, the country in a whole, the constitution, and for their power.		Abusing these doesn't make a president, it makes a dictator.
@RepThomasMassie Only if you put that part somewhere on the 5th page.		I'm having trouble figuring out how there's not already 3/4 majority on this topic, outside of losing radical votes.
@ACLU Only to be clear, it is.	The unfortunate part is that, it's also the baby's.		What rights are more important, The one of choice or the one of life?		Religious or not, we cannot disregard the fact that a life is lost in this process and it must be considered with every descision.
@carminedesanto2 @jimserwan @RepSwalwell @volvocars Usually, if you're shooting someone from long range, that is murder, not self defence or safety, unless war is declared. Hunting is also out of the question with a bmg.		That being said, those guns are still a thrill to fire at a good target range.
@RepSwalwell @volvocars Just putting this out there.	112 makes no sense for safety of Americans, if the highest legal speed limit is 85 in our country.		The overall argument to make firearms safer is contradictive of itself.
@OfficialSPGB @jemelehill This directly reflects the need for capitalism.	No matter which way we go, government interference in it, outside of providing conflict resolution, will cause the same problems.
I can't ask this enough, how can one be against something, anything, or anyone if they do not know what it is or who they really are? https://t.co/lNHxoOj7bo
@jemelehill "If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle." -sun tzu

@Nikitam37415117 @LovesG_d @westpatravel @dbongino Not to say that I'm against capitalism.	Only to say that in the field of general healthcare, it shouldn't be present for many reasons.
@Nikitam37415117 @LovesG_d @westpatravel @dbongino Absolutely.	It doesn't help the situation that abortion is a medical procedure that comes with an industry that wants to make money.		While the rights of children can be seen as a cost to taxpayers.		This is where some of the issues arise when capitalism prevails over medicine.
@Nikitam37415117 @LovesG_d @westpatravel @dbongino Sometimes thinking outside the box helps keep perspective on touchy subjects.
@Nikitam37415117 @LovesG_d @westpatravel @dbongino That is absolutely something that needs to change, people need to know their options.
@Nikitam37415117 @LovesG_d @westpatravel @dbongino A similar legal issue would be conjoined twins. They are one body, two individuals. How do we protect the rights of both if one is against the other?
@Nikitam37415117 @LovesG_d @westpatravel @dbongino Science has absolutely done wonders in this area. One of my own children was born a few months early.		They are in need of protection, but, how can you provide that protection  without forcing compliance?		Maybe situational laws or removal of laws, that could allow easy adoption? https://t.co/MtrCDGvN2b
@Nikitam37415117 @LovesG_d @westpatravel @dbongino I think my asterisk comment explains that.
@LovesG_d @Nikitam37415117 @westpatravel @dbongino The asterisk:	Those natural rights are also intertwined with the mother for nearly the full duration of incubation. So it is difficult, if not impossible, to legally say who's rights are most important, in any context that promotes freedom.
@LovesG_d @Nikitam37415117 @westpatravel @dbongino I don't think that the position changes the view. The position being that government has made an outright mess of the subject. The view being that all humans inherently have those natural rights. 		The view that differs by all, is when those rights start. Mine is at conception*.
#QuestionOfTheDay https://t.co/ckAvDeN1QS
@conserveguitar Your welcome.
@kjhanover @Rocky4President @RepThomasMassie Everyone does :D
@jenniferm_q @TRHLofficial Passive solutions exist as well.		Like helping others understand simple things that affect birth control medication. Helping (specially younger people) understand that (male-female) sex always has a chance of making a baby, even "just the tip".
@jenniferm_q @TRHLofficial I second that.		Ironically we have the medical ability and existing funding, yet the duopoly contradicts active solutions here.		My question is, if it were free, how many people would honestly opt into getting clipped and tied?
@conserveguitar This should be common sense.	The law dictates that this is murder.	There is nothing that can actively be done from the executive position and any action would be passive.		That being said, passively, a proclemation can be made to publically address the issue. (Not an order)
@DienamiteRedder Which one covers "my wife slept with her cousin due to a prior relationship with him"?
@Person4NonGr4ta @ThirdParty That is something a group of people would have to vote on.	If only we had an entity that could do this task, maybe even present a acceptable bill to put that into law.
@Person4NonGr4ta @ThirdParty That is not a question that can be honestly answered by any single person.
@ThirdParty Kidnapping (foreign) has increased due to the falimily immigration policies. Eliminating a seemingly good policy would decrease the issue.
@ThirdParty Does this imply the issues that it solves or the effectiveness of it?
@ThirdParty I don't look at topics in a wysiwyg way, I look further. I like to try and see what causes the issue, along with the potential outcomes of solutions.
@ThirdParty I also plan for contingency. I.e. a digital wall of sorts. Not to prevent traffic (including wildlife) but to make the job of security efficient.
@ThirdParty Securing borders directly equals preventing harmful trespass.		If you have a building with 4 open entrances it would be easier on your security to focus more on a single high flow entrance, rather than all 4 at once.
@ThirdParty In a way, they are preventing harmful crimes like theft.		The purpose of those laws are misrepresented in that ideology.		The practice of bringing in illegal immigrants was a major semi-slave labor issue, where people were snuck in under a deal to pay back the employer.
@ThirdParty The cost of this strategy (so far as I've done the math on) is around 200 million. Which comes directly from the existing budget.
@ThirdParty Revamp the entire legal immigration process. From streamlining the process, handling the process, and diplomatic deals to handle the rejections of the process and extradition of criminals (both sides)
@ThirdParty If you fix the sensor, there is more of a cause for conscern by those who run the light.

@ThirdParty If you are at a stop light at 2 am, the sensor is broke and it will not change but once every 2 hours, will you wait there for 2 hours or eventually drive through illegally?		To fix the issue, would you put a speed bump in the way or fix the sensor?
@AlextheYounga @BobMurphyEcon @jenniferm_q Facebook cannot discern my position it still remains blank

@ToddHagopian @angryAtlas Yes, it does shift and the overall loss of labor is currently minimal.	The issue is, over time it will get efficient and with the eventual doubling of min wage, it will occur more frequently. This causes that minimal issue to grow exponentially.

@LPNational If the country ever requires military force to protect itself, Americans will join the cause in mass.		The draft is only necessary if that cause is questionable enough that Americans see no need to join.

@baove75992 @LPNational I see that your commercial interests influence your condemnation of libertarians. This is, in all honesty, deplorable at best with a likelyhood that you're somehow profiting from these practices at the worst. https://t.co/I2RNLbVm6M

@MillerStream I'm confused by the suicide thing. It is a law that cannot be enforced by sucessfully breaking it, yet, it is in the decision not to break that law, that you get in trouble.
@alexmerced The irony is, that scapegoatism is learned human trait. As a group, we seek a sacrifice for group failures.	The blame cannot be placed on the group in a whole, therefore, it must be an individual who pays.	I do believe the bible sheds light on this topic to the t.

@baove75992 @LPNational It does not immediately solve the issue. It does, however, cause the profitability of the act to suffer and subsequently  the reduction of it.	If the income is less than the cost, the business model will failover into one that does not require force.
@baove75992 @LPNational Also, I asked a question with the intent to establish your understanding and offered my own.	This will establish a base for understanding between views.
@baove75992 @LPNational How can they find a loophole, if there is no loop?
@baove75992 @LPNational I.e. prohibition. We do not see those organizations still making the same effort towards the now legal sale of alcohol. Of the few with above-table breweries, they make money in fair competition with others by market, without the use of force.
@baove75992 @LPNational What is your concept of the driving force of organized crime?	Mine is that it is inherently a business that it is driven by risky income with higher margins, in the absence of a legal choice for their customers.
@gio56 @HamillHimself Are you familiar with the story of stanislav petrov in 1983?	The risk of accidental nuclear war is significantly higher than intentional use of them.		The cost and risk also plays out against ourselves as well.	https://t.co/AGJ7rWiG5c
@gio56 @HamillHimself Ironically, my argument includes both of these.	Research the stability-instability paradox.	Our arguments both include the idea that a self preserving nation will not risk their nation to seek a gain by means of war.	Yours is right, only in the absence of other variables.
@baove75992 @LPNational That was the intent, to point out its logical fallacy.	These are leading questions that aren't productive in this discourse.

@gio56 @HamillHimself That is still MAD (mutually assured destruction).		If we launch "as an option" they and others will as well. It is fully self defeating and this is the point of MAD.
@baove75992 @LPNational By your statement, this means only the LP can be taking this issue seriously, by actually addressing it with a change that will eventually correct it, rather than the rest of the industry being in the way of weeding out these horrific acts against people.
@baove75992 @LPNational Human trafficking is still very much looked down on by libertarians, maybe even more so, by the very nature of libertarianism, for both big and little L's in a whole.	Not a single one of us would advocate this (especially big L), if that was truely the case.
@baove75992 @LPNational Give me a moment, and I'm likely sure a google search result will find a complaint on this level.
@gio56 @HamillHimself We are fully capable of three to 4 theatres of war at any moment. If even a single nuclear bomb was used against our population, we would have the full capability to eliminate the aggressor without the use of nuclear options.
@gio56 @HamillHimself Wherein lies the fallacy.	For them to "destroy us" they would assure their own demise, without a single retaliation needed. MAD is changed to SASD. (Self assured slow death) if they were to initiate force under the SASD limit, our force is, by far, still capable of retaliation.
@ZanderFromNola @LPNational The state, at minimum, must have a standard in place to handle being an intermediary between two parties. (Court)
@ZanderFromNola @LPNational Adults themselves. The state must still make a legal definition of consent, agreed to by the people, for use in complaints regarding a lack of consent.
@baove75992 @LPNational It would be better known to anyone involved if that person was or was not a sex slave. There would also be less business available for the practice to profit from and the person in question will have an easier time coming forward, or having people report on their behalf.
@CodyRayRose @LPNational Do you believe that the government can say "you're not allowed to have a 32oz soda"?		This is the same basic principal as telling people they cannot have consentual sex for any reason. Libertarians believe that it is inherently wrong for the government to dictate private choices.

@Wu_Tron60 @Mind_The_Eye @matthune @AnaKasparian I don't think you're using the term gaslighting correctly.	I'm strictly against manipulation and pursue honesty.
Have everyone in congress physically plant trees across DC together. This will be a good team effort towards climate change and may even reduce the partisaned hostilities, while showing how relatively easy it is to do.
Focus on enforcement of the current emissions regulations or the imprisonment of inspectors that accept money to overlook these violations (not just co2), as this is a form of violent crime that harms innocent people. One of the main purposes of government being in place.
A fund to provide sapling trees or bamboo to self-plant for free. This helps recapture co2 over time, so that we aren't just reducing the output, but, making an active effort to recapture atmospheric co2 in the process.	The overall material cost would be negligable.
Seek state/local law changes to limit burn permits and vehicle emissions testing (even classic cars)		The burning of plants, both recent and ancient, release high levels of carbon dioxide. All activity in this area cannot be stopped completely, but it can be heavily reduced.
Modifacation of patent law.		No company can catch and kill a patent, no company can refute the useage of an idea that will reduce emissions or recapture co2.
How can we address climate change in a way that is affordable?	@AOC @SenFeinstein	Here goes an idea.		Put the laws governing emissions back into place plus a few more focused on output. Companies can find solutions that are cost effective. (The patents exist)
@Mind_The_Eye @Wu_Tron60 @matthune @AnaKasparian She was taking what it was at face value while trying to be nice. There is nearly nobody that could have done better in this situation without completely dismissing them or lieing.		No matter the reason, it is sick to use children like this.

There would also be interplanetary commerce, independant of governance, in the form of knowledge(resource) for tangible resources.
@sksman123 Essentially, the logic of deterrence gives way to the eventuality of use.
@sksman123 Yes, the MAD holds true without stateless actors. A state in normal standing will not risk an essential suicide attack. A single stateless actor may intentionally risk this. As proliferation continues, the chances of these actions increase exponentially.
@Destroyermen2 @LibertyHangout @KaitMarieox That is not entirely true. German tech was superior, however they were, at a point, filled with forced labor. The same would be true of our military, if the oppression is enough to warrant a fight against tyranny.
@SmollestBella @warphound @TRHLofficial There would be a point where they could be self sustaining. That is the ultimate goal of it, alongside research.
@sksman123 In the theatre of war, bullets and bombs limit their effect to the theatre of war. Any nuke will always affect the world in a whole.	I.e. the bombs dropped in Japan spread radioactive material as far as California (maybe further)
@sksman123 If we limit this to a single person's actions, at best the action and response towards a gun use is a couple deaths. A single person launching a nuclear bomb would bring about worldwide destruction for the same.	6-10 medium yield nukes are enough to cause a nuclear winter.
@DScott_C @TRHLofficial In a vaccum, absolutely not.
@warphound @TRHLofficial ? 	That would be impossible, a single bullet would likely kill the entire population.	The idea that they would even choose to adhere to any earth based government would be semi absurd.
@Sabian187 @TRHLofficial Really, that is any government that opposes the views of a large enough segment of the population.

@vanessalleonard @LarrySharpe @beinlibertarian Frodo graph.
@RonKirbyFan It makes no sense to me, at all.
Why on earth would we promote proliferation to raise the risk of nuclear war? On the world stage, the idea is to reduce proliferation.
@LibertyHangout Owning the same weapons is not inherent, or even necessary to subvert tyranny by force.		There would be a self-imposed limitation on the weapons used against the people.

@Destroyermen2 @LibertyHangout @KaitMarieox Complicated systems can be overtaken by the simplest of things. It is not just one force vs another, especially when it becomes service members vs their own families, or risking them as collateral damage.
@Destroyermen2 @LibertyHangout @KaitMarieox The constitution does only effect government, not the people. However, the right that is not to be infringed is a natural right.		Basically, "we recognize the right already exists independ of this document, government is not to infringe on it"

@AOC @notwokieleaks FTLOG! Would someone, anyone , tell these two that their premise is immensely flawed on the transaction without the actual cost?		How can we know if the costume maker's $10 coupon wouldn't be more than the cost of the pizza, or that a $300 coupon isn't reasonable &amp; valid?
@notwokieleaks @AndrewLeifNance @AOC This statement could be true, if we ignore the costumes and focus on the transaction.	If the company sells the pizza at-cost, making 0 profit, she would save them exactly the cost of the coupon in that transaction.
@AP4Liberty @AndrewLeifNance I fully agree. It is OUR duty to decide on a person who best reflects our views when we vote.	I.e.	If they're wealthy, would they reflect or even be able to understand the views of the poor? They may or may not. The poor must assure they can, in order to be represented by votes.

@alexmerced @MattWelch @BNicholsLiberty @BobMurphyEcon @ThomasEWoods @michaelmalice @MarcDClair @RemsoForVA @jenniferm_q Excellent list.
@AndrewLeifNance @MattWelch The positive outcome of legality? 	1. Freedom to make choices about your own adult body.	2. The possibility to lawfully address inherent issues, that are unable to be addressed while the act is done in spite of its illegality.	3. Instantly creates &gt;1 million recognized jobs.
@AndrewLeifNance @MattWelch The solution is not straightforward. A president cannot circumvent or change law directly. They can use the position to bring something harmful into question or use executive orders/proclamations to force the hand of oversight, by congress and judiciary.
@AndrewLeifNance @MattWelch There is an obvious reason that there is not a focus on that, regardless of position. (No pun intended)		I view it as a personal decision.		I have trouble seeing what issues actually cause it to be illegal, as an act of one person against another.
@AreNazisPeople @riceman79 @alllibertynews @CrystalSnake100 @GregoryLoyd6 @philthatremains @LPNational Where is your use of equality stemming from and pertaining to?	This will greatly help the discourse herein.
@riceman79 @AreNazisPeople @alllibertynews @CrystalSnake100 @GregoryLoyd6 @philthatremains @LPNational The absolution of economic equality :/ That is not possible in association with fairness.		In sensical context, it would mean you are equal to those who work as hard as you. 	The major issue with that pursuit is that workload is subjective to the observer.
@AndrewLeifNance @MattWelch What would you like to know?	I am a really open book in the persuit of transparency.
@AndrewLeifNance @MattWelch That describes myself and a couple others. 	I don't care for power so much as I do for people, enough to give them the power, by being someone to weigh pro/con without a partisan view or progress the powers of the state over the people.
@AChefAtLarge @MattWelch Catch 22. 	Then again, there are a few who only see that as a consequence of the position, more than a benefit.

@AbolishAus @riceman79 @AreNazisPeople @New_LibertyTree @alllibertynews @CrystalSnake100 @GregoryLoyd6 @philthatremains @LPNational That is not by the person, that takes external influence to be equal.		Being VERY litteral, He is right. Almost no person is fully equal to another, we all have different strengths and weaknesses.		True equality would be all clones, no jedi.
@riceman79 @AreNazisPeople @AbolishAus @New_LibertyTree @alllibertynews @CrystalSnake100 @GregoryLoyd6 @philthatremains @LPNational By ability, this is an absolute truth (currently).		By the standard of current use it is false.		The best equality we could hope to achieve, would be one where ability and effort is the only thing that provides inequalities, not skin color/etc.
@AreNazisPeople No, I am simply clearing a possible misunderstanding, me and decriminalize don't share all the same views, but I do understand his side of them.	I don't like either and I really think a blend between cap and soc will make a sustainable setup benefiting humanity in a whole.
@AreNazisPeople @AbolishAus @riceman79 @New_LibertyTree @alllibertynews @CrystalSnake100 @GregoryLoyd6 @philthatremains @LPNational He is referring to capitalism as it was intended, being very different from how it is implemented with government backing it.

@officialmcafee Question is, how are secrets still being kept from the people this day and age?
@officialmcafee In ww2 the Japanese commander and two other commanders had a secret attack strategy, to keep from letting the allies know of it, they never communicated (it was too secret). This wiped out two of their fleets and caused the third to retreat.
With #technology and efficiency getting better, the labor force becomes less necessary, while the available labor force (population) and production continues to grow.		There will be people and product, but not enough earning from labor to afford the product.		Solutions?
@officialmcafee Some form of secrecy is necessary. 		In the course of war, secrecy can garner a strategic advantage.		In peace, it is useless and can lead to war.

@AOC Politics aside, to see a civilian go from a day job to Congress and actually take an active role in representation the way it is intended, without corruption, is a truly amazing sight to see nowadays. I hope we see more of this kind of representation in the years to come.

@Marebea98111838 @HeIsSteef @naijawriter @drestevaobueno @IsaacDovere I do not ask that people look at these images like this without reaction, that would be absurd. The reality of this hatred still very much exists and will for generations to come.		You are on point about the comparison. The nazi party used the kkk as direct model.
@Marebea98111838 @HeIsSteef @naijawriter @drestevaobueno @IsaacDovere Once it is achieved. Meaning; once we finally reach the threshold of actual equality (politically and socially), reverting back towards racism, sexism, etc, will be harder to do. (Nearly impossible)
@Cowlitz_Co_DSA I see how you're trying to isolate and misrepresent the statement.		Do you understand how the reproductive organs of a female work, enough to get the analogy?		If not, I would highly suggest you look that up before making your claim and read the rest of the posts.
@Cowlitz_Co_DSA @philthatremains @LPNational That is certainly rich with insight.	You do understand that the "bourgeoisie" proved to be a misconception about the french by Marx, right?	Ironically, you're using it in the same context.
@HeIsSteef @Marebea98111838 @naijawriter @drestevaobueno @IsaacDovere There is a wave of fakes in LP and DNC to attempt division.

@QuotidianT @philthatremains @riceman79 @Cowlitz_Co_DSA @LPNational How does that apply?
@philthatremains @Cowlitz_Co_DSA @LPNational Some don't, some believe in religion, some believe religion is authoritarian.	Point being, is that libertarians are a very broad range of people all in persuit of peace and freedom to different extents and directions.

@ManInTheHoody @Redpainter1 The only one of those that was appropriate was the one involving the one with MLK.

@CrystalSnake100 @philthatremains @LPNational That is an overly complex situation with no standard capable.	A new body created from parts of two other people's bodies. Where only one person involved or the state gets to decide on life or death actions involving a new person for around 9 months.
@zobop_republic @CNN I see the underlying issue there. I should clarify my own personal outlook, since it is not common knowledge. 	A hero doesn't need to be a person with a gun. MLK was a hero (not one that would help this situation, just an example of a personal one to me)
@TampaBayClay @philthatremains @LPNational This is one of the ways that the view of the body being  in any way property can give way to belonging to another.		Some of the simplest concepts can have the greatest consequences.		Some of the simplest changes can also have the biggest benefits.
@philthatremains @LPNational My previous statement failed to post.		If we do not view these as property, there is no need to define rights that are inherent to existance, except to define rights inherent to existance so that others may make no claim to you as if you are property.
@philthatremains @LPNational Language lacks the means to describe this concept accurately with out implying posession. Much like Deutsche has a hard time creating sentances that lack a polar gender and defaults to male for that.
@Flufferangel @jameswelch5 @CNN What he is saying is that if another civilian drew a weapon, they may have shot him as well with a lack of training.
@Flufferangel @jameswelch5 @CNN Training, ironically, was not absent for either of the three on defence.
@Flufferangel @jameswelch5 @CNN If you are properly trained, it is easily distinguishable.
@philthatremains @LPNational I do not believe that as true. Property is a construct of civilization, rights derrive the dominance inherent of civilization. Freedom itself is natural.
@Copperflowers @zobop_republic @CNN See the post on my profile.
@Copperflowers @zobop_republic @CNN There needs to be action by all.

@zobop_republic @CNN It should be the opposite, we need more black and brave people to help create a societal norm.
@lisabearch1 @KelTjorson @CNN Conversely to both. 	If all bystanders had guns, there could have been a lot more crossfire without training.	If ease of access was removed, all those involved, would still have a firearm.
@Quotemeorelse @CNN I unequivocally agree.
@thejokeonus @CNN He did have a gun, you can see it fall and slide away as he collapses.
@jameswelch5 @CNN Drawn, but not in a firing position. Brandishing doesn't constitute an active lethal threat.
@ITSDANKSINATRA @TheSnarkLizard @1MIDNIGHTLIGHT @CNN From the video and training, he was not an active threat, only a potential one, in every frame. If this is justified by training standards, those standards need immediate correction.
@TheSnarkLizard @GerrybombS @CNN Thanks for the link to the report.
@GerrybombS @CNN He was a soldier, not security. The officer who shot him was working as security.
ALEERT clearly must not account for training in active shooter situations that provide situational awareness of other potential friendly responders.	This simple addition may save the lives of countless people in the future, and cannot be overlooked whilst moving forward.
Bradford was acting bravely in defence of those that had been shot. He was willing to step into fire as a soldier and then as a civilian, just as I would have, just as many others would have as well.		We lost a hero on Thanksgiving and gained a travesty of justice in return.
For there to be peace; for there to be trust, the people need a force that adheres to a higher standard, not one that is lesser to the essential standards that civilians are held to. There are many officers that have the honor to hold themselves and each other in this regard.
How can we, the people, place our trust and our safety in the hands of those with no accountability for their actions? When an officer is around we should feel safe in the presence of someone that will protect the innocent, not fearful of their potential actions.
I hold the police in high regard for their sacrifice and I will regularly defend their actions, but this; this is not one of those times. The actions of the officer that shot this man are reprehensible.
This video very much looked like they shot a man just holding a weapon and moving. At NO point in the video does he become an active threat.	By Alabama's law 13A-6-2, this was not murder.	By police standards, this should be held as an unjustified homicide. https://t.co/evqmHY8elW

@schakwin @ToddHagopian If we look at history, it dictates the human group response to extremes. Our government was made to fight the extremes that can harm everyone. We are headed towards the authoritarian extremes of capitalism now, so we need some representation of the opposition.
@schakwin @ToddHagopian Anarchy is in the libertarian ideology as the extreme of it. As for the libertarian party, the extreme does not truely fit. Anarchy cannot happen with good libertarian representation, but, it can be assured with authoritarian control.

@schakwin @ToddHagopian Not by definition, but by some seeing it as an all encompassing solution to issues it becomes a point of failure. The anarchistic peak of libertarianism also gives way to authoritarian takeover.	Some authority hinders absolute authority. No ideological dominance works unopposed.
If we spend all of our energy on opposition, we will fail to see any potential benefit in compromise. Without compromise, any ideology that succeeds becomes authoritarian, even #libertarian.		We must associate with the freedoms of all, not just the specific views of a few.

@RyanWarrell @beinlibertarian To some extent, that is quickly becoming a sought after option by many due to a lack of adequate representation. Opression is not an act of a libertarian. How any libertarian lend a hand to the opression of another ideology?

We work hard as Americans to demonize some views and in that action, we halt any ability for compromise. The #libertarian way enables the ability compromise between ideas, so long as it heads towards the direction of freedom, not the expansion of government.

@BlkHawkDowneyJr @annanotherthng @andresha_bass @HaniWalker90 @shannonrwatts I am reasonably sure the party will pick Kamala. There is really not a true vote in the dnc primary, just whomever they see fit. 	They will never pick a true progressive, however, they will pick one that can possibly get progressive votes with false hope.
@shannonrwatts I'm not all that excited about the card pulling that will soon commence. It is really my hope that she tries to make attempts to minimize this or at least not endorse it from her followers. We don't need yet another polarizing figure. It is a winning tactic, but at what cost?
@dwight_poop @sheepdog5931 @KassyDillon @realDonaldTrump *caugh*
@KassyDillon Some of the hardcores at work don't believe he caved. They say he decided to open the government to get the workers paid out of kindness.	They are seriously confused after I told them about Stone and the sealed indictment/warrant right before the capitulation.
I am all for liberty, even if it means giving up a little of my own so that others can have it as well.
@realDonaldTrump How high are you?
@RyanHillMI @realDonaldTrump That was before he knew that Roger Stone was arrested.	His tone changed surprisingly quick once that story came out.
@Jonnie18 @chhardman @allidoisowen @realDonaldTrump He is being sarcastic.
@chhardman @allidoisowen @realDonaldTrump By the rest of us helping, does this include organic (non bot) ddos?
@realDonaldTrump So this leads me to believe that the only reason you decided to reopen the government was that your close associate was arrested. How does this lend any credibility to your argument of #WitchHunt?
@realDonaldTrump Halting the war on drugs does exactly that.	It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out the causality that plays out due to it's existance.		A "stable genius" should at least understand simple causality.
#TrumpCaved directly after the arrest of an associate. The objective he was seeking was proven pointless.	This is a three week reprieve, let's not count this as a total victory just yet.
One thing I can assuredly say is, under me, there will be no further interference in other country's politics for proffit and the prevention of internal corruption will never be overlooked.
Kushner is going for top level security clearance without even qualifying for secret clearance. We really need to sort this presidential cabinet out before it brings us to failure.

@David_Leavitt As with anything, there is some truth to this issue. While I agree that it is predominantly a point of descrimination, there are other considerations that should be weighed, mainly medical and associated costs, that are overlooked due to this subject's polarization.

@realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr They aren't united under the need for a wall, they are united because they could loose votes if they capitulate. You are playing them. What's more sad, but true to nature, is that it is not your style, it's Putin's.
Therefore, any contribution to my campaign will be donated to any source providing relief to the federal workers in need for the foreseeable future of this shutdown.
I personally think it is a shame to be raising funds for political gain in a time like this.	Using this issue to further skyrocket financial support in opposition of trump while not supporting the people affected by his decisions.
@thomaskaine5 There was, however it was not on the surface like it is today.
If the government decided that, in pursuit of all ms13 gang members in the United States, we will now use large bombs to combat them everywhere they live, would you be ok with this?		If you say no, why would you be ok with us doing this to another country?
@jenniferm_q If they give up sources they loose sources.	If Mueller calls it false and it's not that could hurt, while full correction could point out his direction.	It is a big catch 22 situation by both sides.
@KamalaHarris You are raising funds durring a shutdown that is affecting many people financially.	That is going to end up a means of attacking your nomination and candidacy in a whole.	You may want to hold off on the fundraisers or donate it to them til the shutdown ends.
@jenniferm_q Mueller's office claimed "inaccurate".	Buzzfeed now wants to know what parts were inaccurate so they can make correction, but, I'm reasonably sure that will not get a response, due to the nature of the article vs the secrecy of the investigation.	The correction could affect it.

@GIJoeMcD @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump The shutdown will harm the FBI on many levels as well. He is using Congress and the duopoly that persists in it against itself.	He is using both Republicans and his followers to his own means.

@RonKirbyFan I found this info days after the tariff issue began. I made a post about it that I am trying to find on here or fb.

For a presidential election, we could take the top three candidates from each state to represent a state's ranked vote for president.
#RankedChoiceVoting eliminates a large portion of all our election woes, it also leads to a more representative democracy without the usual vote shaming and a majority of political attack ads.		This video may help understand the process.	@davidpakmanshow	https://t.co/MdSKG1uaZj
With this method it also makes gerrymandering impossible, as, you can redraw a district in any way and still get the same result.	It also prevents candidates from trying to appeal to only high population city centers and swing states, while removing party monopolies on states.
If we change to #RankedChoiceVoting each candidate on a ballot will receive a percentage of the vote for each district. If we carry that percentage forward to the totals, instead of the current winner takes all stance, all votes bear equal importance at each step.
Currently we have electors that are middlemen to the actual vote of any voter. These middlemen do no always vote based on the votes cast from their district. As an example, our last election had around 10 faithless electors, that voted against the people.		https://t.co/tGLdHAOKD7
#voting #RepresentationMatters 	If we open all federal elections to #RankedChoiceVoting and eliminate the electoral college. We can have equil and accurate representation of every state and ideology.

@METALBLADE28 @bgwinettem @Kokomothegreat @HealingCombat @AshevillePolice Because any defense lawyer will use "in the video, she put her hand on him first" and "she made two advances at him afterwards, both were met with force" to counter any claim made by her in court.

@charliekirk11 @Dennis_35901 Also, this doesn't protect our own, it creates the image of protection to gain a following.

@RonKirbyFan @AOC @realDonaldTrump I try to deal in only truth. Same as you.
@RonKirbyFan @AOC @realDonaldTrump Fair enough. I usually think of the extreme costs of medical bills as an oppressive/exclusionary feature of an absolute necessity that limits freedom in general life.
@RonKirbyFan @AOC @realDonaldTrump That's another major difference that I think a lot of people take for granted.
@RonKirbyFan @AOC @realDonaldTrump Do you feel that you, and those around you enjoy more freedom with your healthcare system?
@RonKirbyFan @AOC @realDonaldTrump Only one holds a position where an imbalance of political views and an aptitude for authoritarianism can inflict lasting damage to all of America.
@RonKirbyFan @AOC @realDonaldTrump I don't agree with @AOC on all things, but I do agree that what she and many Americans seek needs representation, if we are to avoid some very large issues that stem from the two major parties closing themselves off while diverging away from each other and liberty.

@DanniDallas @lurkingheretic @tatigee2 @Nadcha22698169 @MaguireRobbie @realDonaldTrump Ringworm is easily noticed.

@DanniDallas @lurkingheretic @tatigee2 @Nadcha22698169 @MaguireRobbie @realDonaldTrump I was misdiagnosed and treated as a drug addict when I returned to a hospital after undergoing anesthesia for a biopsy.

@DanniDallas @lurkingheretic @tatigee2 @Nadcha22698169 @MaguireRobbie @realDonaldTrump My first child, in order to prevent preterm labor, they gave her mother a medication that was no longer allowed and she had to be flown to a neonatal care facility in case of complications, we are dealing with those effects 9 years later.
@DanniDallas @lurkingheretic @tatigee2 @Nadcha22698169 @MaguireRobbie @realDonaldTrump I could understand if it was a fluke, but, it is far too common.	Last month, there was an older gentleman alone in a waiting room I was seated in, clearly having symptoms of a heart attack for about 20 minutes, it took many attempts to get him help.
@stephenfhayes I am all for reduction of government interference in personal lives. The issue with the GOP version of that, would be that, they often push for reduction of interference in corporations and further interfere in personal lives.
There are interesting similarities I have noticed between @AOC and @realDonaldTrump.	The more negative media coverage there is and the more they are attacked, the more followers they get.	They both effectively use social media and fight opposition unapologetically.
@lurkingheretic @DanniDallas @tatigee2 @Nadcha22698169 @MaguireRobbie @realDonaldTrump This is very true. I told a friend she had ringworm over a large portion of her body.

@DanniDallas @tatigee2 @Nadcha22698169 @MaguireRobbie @realDonaldTrump The issue with the premise of their opinion is that they wouldn't have moved if they thought it was good.	With any institution, business, or idea, you are going to have people who don't like it. If you base an opinion on only those people, it is not fully informed.
@WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump The democratic party is already causing it's own turmoil, if your "organization" is truly in the effort of truth, you need to realize, only half of the truth is still a lie.

@matsobon @beinlibertarian So, I am taking the guess you either have no clue what you're talking about and just want to be hateful, or that you do not believe in the democratic freedom of representation, and you're just throwing that out there in an effort to save face, rather than give a useful answer.
So far it the data is interesting on even shares between Republican, Democrat, and Libertarian shares, but it is a sample size that is too small.	#BuildTheWall or #NoWall https://t.co/XDkBkxI4pd
@matsobon @beinlibertarian If you can state one factual reason why that would cause our collapse, without a dictator(s) in charge and why a significant portion of Americans should not be allowed representation for a non harmful or hate driven objective in their pursuit of freedom, I am all ears.
@AlexNowrasteh Now, it seems a little more obvious why I am not seeking local office in this state, when this guy got 61% of the votes.
@kevinheaslip @AlexNowrasteh Look up @TYTPolitics, @johniadarola, and @AnaKasparian, 	If a progressive media outlet uses the information, it becomes bad to conservatives, even if some of it matches their ideology.	We are at a point where r&amp;d are split so far they may break the country.

@bradenpace @Shell4Liberty @ToddHagopian @LPNational @LarrySharpe I will also add, that the same applies to all other parties. 2020 is already stacking up to be a bad one for the democratic nomination and the republican... well, there is a great chance that a level of sanity at the convention could catapult a libertarian in polls instantly.

@riceman79 @DeaterBob @alllibertynews @CarolinaGirl585 @LPNational Current government and the ongoing abuses to rights are the problem.

@riceman79 @DeaterBob @alllibertynews @CarolinaGirl585 @LPNational That was my same view for most of my life and a reason I couldn't fully get behind the LP. It hurts any party "bigly" to have some of the loudest and most consistant people in it advocating for something that is seen as quintessentially "anti-american" by most people.
I wonder how many libertarians realize the benefits that fully #progressive representation can have towards #libertarian representation. They support many of the key elements that are @LPNational barriers, in both policy and the ability to provide representation.
@matsobon @beinlibertarian That is a state of emergency, for corporate Republicans or Democrats.

Trump is not a fluke in this path, he is the result of it; a harbinger of what will become of our nation if either party is willfully allowed to spread missinformation and retain the fruits of corruption in the pursuit of power and control of not only our lives, but the world.
Our greatest defeat as Americans can only be our own. If we continue to relinquish our will and our rights to those that mean to control us instead of serving our best interest, we relinquish the idea of freedom.	We relinquish democracy in trade for fascism and imperialism.
If we are to return to a country by and of the people. We need to start with surrendering our minds to reality, not the tribal nature of a political party. Think for yourself, educate yourself, never put yourself in a position where you are blindly voting on a party first.
Our own country has around 800 military bases in 80 countries.	We use our force to topple other governments and put other leaders, friendly to our will, in their place.	We use our power to influence trade.	How can we not see ourselves as unequivocally imperialistic? https://t.co/3FyW4lNOMS
Our own country, under the nearly complete control of a duopoly, has been able to influence or control all aspects of our life. The only things that stand in the way of our becoming fully fascist is a piece of paper and we the people.		We are ignoring our path towards fascism. https://t.co/SXk8DAbCNW
We fight against the idea of socialism under the guise that it is always fascism.	We detest the idea of British and soviet imperialism.	We come together to fight these ideas in foreign countries.	We also disregard our own acts of the same.
"I think one man is just as good as another so long as he's honest and decent and not a nigger or a Chinaman." - Truman		Truman was the very opposite of Wallace.		This single act and the lies following his presidency started us on the path we are being led towards today. https://t.co/NBBjrq53bf
#Democrats forcefully pushed out the wildly popular Wallace in place of Truman knowing the president would die. This man would later go on to drop the atomic bomb, as an act of terror on a country ready to surrender, and the second one for the same reason, to display our power.
#politics 	While people spend their time buying in to what the major parties designate as a candidate, remember their picks may not represent the best interest of anything outside of their agenda.	The agenda isn't what they present to the public, it is what benefits party first.

@realDonaldTrump Where do you attain these figures that the rest of us (anybody not sourcing you as facts) can not see for ourselves?
@RonKirbyFan Absolutely not. He will break treaties in this pursuit, unless his pursuit is solely vanity, not function.
@RonKirbyFan @MemberofdaTribe @RealRyanCornell They will field another establishment dem.	It would surprise me if they let a progressive take the nomination as they very blatantly removed Wallace for being one and have been following the trend since.
@RonKirbyFan Unfortunately he can. The funding will have to be taken from the existing budget. Imagine how the new Mexican leadership will take this, claiming their country is a threat.
@KassyDillon Fox news was covering it as a bash piece last night.
The path to the elimination of enemies is not to create those enemies to begin with.	Of those we have created, empathy and compassion for them, in place of hatred and fear, will bring about greater security and ultimately peace in our lifetime.
@BMinotti9500 @AOC Positive cultural influence and remaining lighthearted in light of a huge focus of condemnation from her opposition, I would say she is serving more than just her voters with this.
@IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib @AOC I hope that those figures of diversity fight to make a positive change, otherwise, it could hurt the pursuit of equality.
@johniadarola @realDonaldTrump The sad part is, it shouldn't matter.	If we had more #CountryOverParty politicians or no parties at all, more things would work as intended under our constitution.
@bonoforpres @johniadarola @realDonaldTrump Even "the bill on Capitol hill" says that after the president used the veto congress can still bypass it.
Senators, the use of nondisclosure agreements to hide affairs are illegal.
@MarkRuffalo @FCC The internet, being a harbinger of freedom of information, should never be hindered from advance, it should be encouraged. 	As a nation, we cannot continue the practice of missinformation or any attempt to continue it.

@dale_stoddard @ThePeteRaymond In order to advocate for or against any issue, I do extensive research into the topics to understand them in depth.

@NorthernArms @Joshoa123 @ThePeteRaymond @AP4Liberty How about a gun that shoots drugs? If you are shooting them with the right one you could be killing them with laughter or kindness.
@Trevor_ShowALK @ThePeteRaymond That really depends on the intruder.
@dale_stoddard @ThePeteRaymond They do. The use of this tool, with our culture of fear of that tool, leads some people to feel empowerment and get a type of "high" when they use it.	Much in the same way looking at a few LEDs can make someone laugh or cry while watching a movie.
@skxmar @ThePeteRaymond Veterans suffering from PTSD use thc to protect themselves from a large portion of it.	A lot of the harder drug users use them to protect themselves from (and forget) their past.	Anesthesia (opioid) protects you from the pain of surgery.
@PattyArquette Edison, to prove how dangerous AC was, used it to kill animals in public exhibitions. The political and corporate motivation behind this led to the electric chair.
@BernieSanders I agree, but, how can we implement this without the for-proffit side of the industry abusing this endeavor, as they are now.	Fixing the foundation before adding on would make a stable implementation of free public education.
@TYTLive 	The progressive priority is not acceptable to either party. It is unaccepting of the quid-pro-quo money inherent of our current structure. Any internal or third party view that truthfully pushes against this will be pushed out before it can get a foothold.

Even an in-place law needs realistic consideration of the grey area.

@DebbieAAldrich @JMfreespeech At this point it is safe to assume security and border issues are a priority only to be exponentially prolonged by both parties, not repaired. This nets both sides a profit and votes.

If you say that I "'need to' loose a couple pounds", it doesn't mean you're forcing me to put down that donut, only suggesting that I do.	To which I will reply, "I will be fat and happy, if I want" and eat the donut.

An ideological version of a pen test to better the ideology without a real world failure of it.		Would you agree that it is good, bad, or in between to do this?

"I" also uses less characters for examples.

Did I run the stop sign with no other people around to harm? Did I narrowly avoid a pedestrian? Did I avoid interaction only to cause someone else to hit another car head on?
@riceman79 @MTcowboy3250 @alllibertynews @kman820 @Petroh2o @clamsroll @donbcivil @DavidErosenko @OFFICIAL_ERRT @zetetic2017 @jburlin1974 @AlecA82475839 @NekSwat @HamKnuckle @DanaLark3 @Bill_nills_ski @CurranBrock @Mary52930080 @DebbieAAldrich @Emichael66 @JMfreespeech @realDonaldTrump This is the area we need to avoid neglecting as libertarians. Simply because this is the area that requires laws on judgment one way or another between individuals.
@riceman79 @MTcowboy3250 @alllibertynews @kman820 @Petroh2o @clamsroll @donbcivil @DavidErosenko @OFFICIAL_ERRT @zetetic2017 @jburlin1974 @AlecA82475839 @NekSwat @HamKnuckle @DanaLark3 @Bill_nills_ski @CurranBrock @Mary52930080 @DebbieAAldrich @Emichael66 @JMfreespeech @realDonaldTrump Yes, this is why I say it is a grey area.	If I do something to myself that affects no other person, it should never be a crime. If I do something that harms someone else, it is a crime. This is mostly cut and dry.	What is not, is if I am doing something that could harm another.
@DelParkNaySayer @realDonaldTrump I did. Hence my check and reply.
@MTcowboy3250 @alllibertynews @kman820 @riceman79 @Petroh2o @clamsroll @donbcivil @DavidErosenko @OFFICIAL_ERRT @zetetic2017 @jburlin1974 @AlecA82475839 @NekSwat @HamKnuckle @DanaLark3 @Bill_nills_ski @CurranBrock @Mary52930080 @DebbieAAldrich @Emichael66 @JMfreespeech @realDonaldTrump I would argue that running stop signs and speeding are a crime that could have an unintended victim.		 The grey area of "victimless".		If I walk down a crowded street firing bullets without harming a single person, by the same concept, I can do this, until I hit someone/thing.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/QA2bqK7Hjz
@Liberty_Thunder I can still watch it here. 	We have the freedom of speech that many other countries do not have.	Regardless of whatever freedom we may have here, American companies still have to abide by foreign rules to operate outside of the USA.
@eachus @alllibertynews @TheLibRepublic The pocahontas thing is a modern racial remark towards Native Americans, regardless of who it is being used against.
@GOPChairwoman @edmgail1944 @realDonaldTrump Border security is not the first thing on the mind of an individual that does not try to solve the standing issues that cause dangerous and illegal crossings to be a viable alternative to the legal ones.
@eachus @alllibertynews @TheLibRepublic This is in seriously bad taste. Natives are not fair game for racism.
@JohnBrennan America can't put a grenade in the Middle East's hands and walk away with the pin. If we are going to walk away, which we should, we need to at least put the pin back in the grenade.
@_RichMars_ @georgeconfused @realDonaldTrump I can see how you can form that assumption. I can assure you, compromise does not always entail negotiations as you may think. Sometimes it can be achieved by a public image or by direct/indirect affirmation where the oppositional party to an issue can take it or leave it.
@libertarianism @alllibertynews All ideologies have them. What is important to the majority is how conservatism can help while recognizing it's pitfalls in co-existance with other ideologies.
To give scale to how far away it is, it takes longer than America has been a country for #UltimaThule to orbit the sun in the Kuiper belt (298yrs),	6 light-hours away.		The first high resolution photo(s) should be released tomorrow.		Congrats to #NASA and the #NewHorizons team. https://t.co/Qbz90vXbMu
The population of #DC deserves representation where they live.	They deserve the same voice in #Democracy for themselves and federally as the two states that border them, the two that share no conus border, and any other state.	#StateOfDC
@georgeconfused @_RichMars_ @realDonaldTrump That should take presidence. Realizing an error and correcting it is admirable. We all can make errors. Ignoring it or doubling down on it is a completely different altogether.
@_RichMars_ @georgeconfused @realDonaldTrump Also, Twitter is a very public record.	If what you said were true, it would be a direct quote through my own response, word of mouth, or post. I do not use insinuations, unless it is of a humorous nature, and it would be absurd to assume anything otherwise coming from myself.
@_RichMars_ @georgeconfused @realDonaldTrump If there were negotiations and peaceful interaction beforehand, terrorists, in majority, likely wouldn't have the fuel for their fire to exist.	Negotiations with a terrorist organization would be nearly impossible.	Changing their perception of us would be a more effective task.
@RationalMale @VibeHi People from my generation have no excuse not to know at least one, if they had a tv. https://t.co/2AtJ1aqBIC
@_BrandonWatkins @VibeHi @RationalMale I could likely decimate that quiz. So could a majority of my graduating class, but, our public schooling was different than it is today. It was also far less segrigated.
@beinlibertarian @ForestAflame I enjoyed the laugh, because I knew the joke. I don't think other countries understand that type of humor tho. I'm glad they pulled it and made that statement, but I do imagine some fringe foreign news network will cover that as a story of "the American war machine".
@adamdunaway @MelodyBoatrigh1 @Dingusamongus @realDonaldTrump I already know the cost of this pursuit, it is part of how I would tackle the issue.	My plan should cost nearly $200 million and may remain within the existing budget.
@samiamnurnot @FamilyGuyonFOX @TheSimpsons @maddow She is a good liberal source.
Our arbitrary measures help us make sense of and communicate about the world around us, based on things that do not usually change (constants). Communication is harder when the rest of the world has a constant that we refuse to accept, but now define our measurement off of. https://t.co/HqWf2opB9M
@Wsewell525 @aSciEnthusiast @neiltyson Please don't, I rather enjoy the force that helps make life possible. 😆
@neiltyson I would argue that it does, for Social sciences.	No other event on our planet will have people systematically cheering in sequence nearly every hour in a single rotation of the earth on its axis while a great number of them believe it is flat.
#newyear #NewHorizons 	The first day of this year, should bring some awesome scientific discovery, in the form of pictures of  #UltimaThule.	The craft has already passed and the 6 hour wait (limited by the speed of light) is on.
@candbab99 @realDonaldTrump I am somehow awaiting (and dreading) the eventuality of him saying that will be done through tariffs.
@adamdunaway @MelodyBoatrigh1 @Dingusamongus @realDonaldTrump Border security begins with better access to legal transit. If we do this, border guards will be less impeded by good-to-do immigrants and can focus on more important security tasks.
@TruthTalkerUSA @Dingusamongus @realDonaldTrump I can almost certainly keep up with old tech. I am also familiar with records, tube transistors, and can still program a VCR while using an analog modem.		It does not meant these technologies are worth security applications, like the 1980's computers we use for nukes.
@kayleehilyer @Turnip2020 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @DLoesch I am taking true action, I am actually running for 2020.

@AlbertLoyola1 @realDonaldTrump On the contrary, we have many. Some are awe inspiring, some are heart felt reminders of the good people we have lost. https://t.co/9K3G1jML7L
@JimKilbane @realDonaldTrump There is a reason why their modern constitutional monarchy is accepted and respected.
@candbab99 @realDonaldTrump A sense of security built with the labor of Mexicans. That is what got many trump-republicans behind the idea.
@HPFATZ @alexdgrossman @realDonaldTrump My kids thought this is what trump was doing to people when he was "firing" them. https://t.co/CJTW1ddq6p
@Dingusamongus @realDonaldTrump This makes just as much sense.
@realDonaldTrump I can do this with a couple raspberry pis, cameras, solar panels, and a wireless mesh network. For a tenth of the cost.
@realDonaldTrump It is 2019, a pit of Legos would be just as effective as your wall. We also have technology that can create a truely invisible wall that will notify guards without a physical barrier.
#KimJongUn #NewYearsEve2019	As I have said before, our involvement with Korea will not go over well. @realDonaldTrump	The best thing you can do is wish them well publically and leave them to do this on their own. It doesn't need to be "your victory".		https://t.co/8x8r4R5YLr https://t.co/BK2RdnyYBi
@georgeconfused @_RichMars_ @realDonaldTrump I have firsthand accounts that say their defeat is not a true statement.	Defeating enemies can take three paths death, surrender, or compromise. I will always choose the latter if at all possible.
@_RichMars_ @georgeconfused @realDonaldTrump Ungrateful for what exactly? What positive influence have we had in the region?
@rob_coats @georgeconfused @realDonaldTrump America and, by association, the voters that enabled these actions. Need we forget that it is all of our duty to vote for those that represent our interests. If these things happen, we are all responsible for our interests for better or worse.	That is democracy.
@_RichMars_ @georgeconfused @realDonaldTrump We should focus on those weeds we planted, to rectify our involvement.
@georgeconfused @realDonaldTrump The enemy WE helped create.
@jacob_daniels14 @BernieSanders He will not, his friend @SenWarren is going to be the potential democratic nominee.	Not a bad choice, considering what she stands for, however, it would be a ultimate loss to the progressive cause to displace a congress person, rather than backing a candidate that agrees.
#Equality	I stand for equality in all things and I do have an issue with any person or organization trying to assert a race, religion, sex, or ideology in the effort for dominance of it. 	This is not solely an American issue,   we should become a positive example to the world.
If you do regularly follow the news, severely biased sources are not useless. They provide a contrast to other sources, allowing a better understanding of an opposing view, no matter how unrealistic it may be.	I do watch fox for this reason. (And @FamilyGuyonFOX / @TheSimpsons )
If you want to be fully informed, it would be wise to avoid sources that lack integrity if you do not regularly follow the news. Stick to sources that are centered regardless of your personal view.
You can tell which way a source will lean by funding and ties to political parties. 	@seanhannity would be a good example here, where a majority of his recent coverage has had an obvious defensive premise due to the ties with @realDonaldTrump and @MichaelCohen212.
On the opposite end there is @FoxNews. Not the only biased organization, just a good example. They commonly field one sided coverage. The integrity of the organization is not the best and they will put out stories without initial fact checks while corrections are quiet and rare.
@TYTPolitics @LastWeekTonight @BBCWorld @AP @NewsHour @NPR are good examples of integrity. The commentary may have a lean for some, but these sources do not sideine issues in opposition to their general commentary.
#FakeNews	News is not inherently fake. Some of the stories covered may be and some of the commentary may be well off base.	The root issue is the integrity of journalists and political funding of news organizations to provide skewed views.
Have a happy new year!	Be safe tonight.	Please do not drive intoxicated, there are free services to get you home if you drink a little too much.
@TYTPolitics @EmmaVigeland She was planning this all along. Why else would she be paying for national ads?
@ToddHagopian The person with a lack of essential resources at a cost they cannot possibly bear can be extremely limited in their freedoms.	The part of the LP view I'm coming to detest is the one of a narrow view of freedom, to the point that it feels authoritarian in nature.
@ToddHagopian Don't vote on promises from politicians, good or bad it is likely a lie. 	Vote on what they stand for, understanding of their role in service, their proposed solutions, and their aptitude for stupidity.
@AlexRoseOO7 @ToddHagopian Libertarianism (ideology) is, progressives and quite a few  Republicans are libertarian.

@Im_MrTaxFree @samiamnurnot @ginged78 @realDonaldTrump Because, they still have elections in the future.	At this point protecting donors, votes, and their interests are going to take presidence.	A tie to trump prior to the Mueller hammer would not be wise if you have something to hide.
@samiamnurnot @Im_MrTaxFree @ginged78 @realDonaldTrump I dont think it is sinister, but, you are right. He knows what is coming and his mindset is, if he can list accomplishments (the wall, Syria, etc), he may avoid impeachment.	He is not running the country so less as he is using it for himself and this tactic will not work.
@samiamnurnot @ginged78 @realDonaldTrump I have had that feeling since 2016.	It is the entire reason I am running for 2020 now.
@realDonaldTrump So, unless your vanity mission is preserved, you will shut down the means for people to do things the legal way.		Also, you keep Americans from doing the same, impacting their livelyhood on top of those affected by the shutdown.		The people are not pawns in your game.
@BonnerBonners @realDonaldTrump The Republicans that lost have bailed already, even tho they could still vote. It is dangerous for the remaining career politicians to associate with trump at this point (waiting on mueller) and they don't all agree with him.
@BernieSanders If you want to end this, stop allowing the prisons to earn federal and state money for proffit.	Likewise with charter schools.		Our investments have turned more towards payback for contributions than helpful public programs.
In a way, I am glad it is trump that has shown us what an authoritarian leader looks like and that he made it to the Whitehouse.	This reveals a lot about our nation, in a somewhat safer way.	I could only immagine where we would be now, if he knew what he was doing in that office.

@jackcarneyjr @rick2162 @thelashnanny @DuranWebDev @BarryBahrami @Alyssa_Milano It may be sarcasm on his part, but, it is true that black people have a harder time with their 2nd ammendment rights. This is not bait as much as it is a realistic issue that persists, even if the law is indescriminate.
@DuranWebDev @BarryBahrami @Alyssa_Milano They should do this in the first place. Domestic violence/abuse usually continues outside of the domestic environment.

@XristianSimon @realDonaldTrump 5 billion is only a fraction of the cost. If I remember correctly the full project will be between 20 and 35 billion. More than enough to completely revamp immigration and provide better security.

@stopsteponsneks @gul_garak @alllibertynews @RBarna5 @justinamash I see that you are trying the debate tactic of pinning an idea on someone to force a defensive position and give you backing to attempt control and dominance.

@stopsteponsneks @gul_garak @alllibertynews @RBarna5 @justinamash 2.	In this way, who would be wrong?	Logic would dictate that the original person occupying the land would be the owner. 	Reality, however, is completely indifferent of flawless logic. It relies on assumed logic. I assume it is mine, others verify this, so, it is mine.
@stopsteponsneks @gul_garak @alllibertynews @RBarna5 @justinamash 1. 	If you were to put the historic relevance in a shorter timeframe it would no longer be absurd.	If I take your house/land by force, claim it as mine and say you can only have this shed, then I'm going to sell the house and yard to others, then reclaim part of it from them.

@MI_MapleMan @realDonaldTrump There is also a treaty protecting this area that will have to be broken in order for his wall to even be effective.
@realDonaldTrump You can easily pass the "drugs" through that.	Also, they already make devices that can defeat this design.	This is the not so cheap version on sale for kids. https://t.co/teM03PPR4z
The cost of this? Nearly $200 million, with an increased potential for revenue and the loss of politically inflated issues to help get votes.		We can actually offer full solutions to this problem if we put aside political bias and base decisions on facts. #CountryOverParty
If we were to completely open our border to people at appropriate places, we can significantly reduce the numbers coming outside of checkpoints.		Border patrol would then be more effective in their role of security.
The sole act of hiring a hundred more judges to handle immigration cases, with no other changes needed, would cost taxpayers less overall and alleviate the issues we see in majority, without potentially straining relations with our neighbors.
The reality of this situation is that we are opting for a multi billion dollar physical barrier to prevent the passage of nearly a thousand or so non misdemeanor criminals a year and It does not prevent the 41% of illegals who overstay their visa.		How is this money well spent?
The next option will be an easier trip to Canada and a short walk south.	This has already started to happen.		Will we then provide for a northern boarder wall as well in the years to come with a country that was originally offered inclusion into our country's independance?
If the wall is somehow effective, it will break treaties to do so. It will also leave the entirety of the issue on Mexico's doorstep, quite litterally.	This causes a much bigger problem.	Where will these people go while they wait for a country supposedly against oppression?
A wall can also be viewed as an insinuation of war with a neighbor.	Mexico's government refused this even tho they deal with a net gain immigration issue by American illegals.	This could ultimately lead to tensions between our countries.
A #BorderWall is not only a method to keep people out, it is one to keep people in. 	History's most recent wall was to keep the people of Berlin contained for the Soviet union. 	One which our country fought to tear down for the people of berlin.
@2Anoinfringing @dropsondeoperat @Ocasio2018 @EricBlake12 News is not where I am drawing this from. It is their speeches on the topic. They tend to over generalize immigrants from the south as criminals for their purpose while data attests to the contrary. If there is a theft issue that needs to be addressed, why would it not be key?
@Ocasio2018 This funding will require roughly $25 from every single taxpayer next year.	The cost of paying healthcare to all immigrants was roughly $5 this year.	If we build a wall we will still pay for healthcare with an additional $2 for maintenance.	I dont see the logic in this.
@dropsondeoperat @Ocasio2018 @EricBlake12 I must ask if it is actually people crossing the border or people using them as an excuse? The logic being; if there is evidence of this being directly linked, gop would have used this as a key point in discussion, not their normal generalized points of reference.
@historyteach84 @ColinHanks "I dont want to pay for immigrant healthcare, but I will pay more to prevent them from having it."	-The logical takeaway from the argument for a wall asap.
@ColinHanks The abrupt and awkwardly timed withdraw seems more like a bum rush funding venture for the wall. This is trump we are talking about. He doesnt fully believe he is in any real trouble, and that the wall will somehow prevent prosecution, because he has done something huge, so huge.
@2020fight @TomiLahren @realDonaldTrump We created the problem, it is definately our responsibility to fix it. An absolute and public withdraw while saying they are defeated may not be the best idea. 		Pulling out fast and arrogantly walking away usually causes hard feelings.

If you have any real knowledge of black history, Doctor who's "rosa" episode may make your heart sink, or cry.	It is set in Montgomery, Alabama in the 50's and it gives a very interesting and intentionally accurate view of the timeperiod while they save Rosa Parks' legacy.
@SassyEconomist @HeroPrinceLuke @RealCandaceO 100 years ago, the idea of providing any help to the "negro" was absurd, even as much as allowing them to have birth control.
@SassyEconomist @RealCandaceO She seems to do this often. It is almost as if she hates women and minorities, but wants them on her side. 	Now, where have I seen this narritive before?
@RealCandaceO You shamefully represent who you are. You're preying on minorities with these false narritives, not helping. You need to check yo self... https://t.co/yHJr0FWCVm
@RealCandaceO A Democrat vote put in place laws that caused segregation. 	A Republican member of the kkk killed Malcom X, 3 years later another shot MLK.	If history is to dictate the future of these parties, neither can be absolved of their hatred for minorities.
@realDonaldTrump Unjustified and retaliation do not fit together. Unless, you're the type to retaliate to a poke in the shoulder with a bomb. Then, the retaliation isn't justified.
@BernieSanders My question is, why are they getting a bonus at all if they failed?
@RealCandaceO Your statement does exactly the same. You have essentially stated that women are weak.
@RepThomasMassie It is unquestionably not their "duty", it is their choice to put their life in harms way. It is the duty of no American citizen to willingly become a human shield, it is their character that dictates this practice, it is bravery.
@officialmcafee Publically trashing someone is decidedly NOT libertarian, unless that person does something to you.
@JillRTeamXRP @officialmcafee This is true.
@GuytheGypsy @officialmcafee Why... does kirk... have the constitution, if he is a... Starfleet captain?	Really, why? I started on TNG.
@JillRTeamXRP @officialmcafee He is living freely and this is something I respect him for even if I don't agree with all he says.
@JillRTeamXRP @officialmcafee If you feel the person with those ideas may hinder that message with their personal lifestyle, then you must weigh that information. Hiding it will not change the outcome of the issue and will leave people without the ability to weigh that information for themselves.
@footofgov The idea of a gift, an actual gift, is not one of a monetary basis, tho, it can be monetarily attained.	However a personal and thoughtful gift to someone I care for may be as simple as a flower I picked along the way, a back scratch, or even my undivided attention.
@officialmcafee @GuytheGypsy Nobody can tell you how to be free, but you can show them what it is to be free.
@officialmcafee @JillRTeamXRP Honesty, something that is lost in politics. Hiding our past and true nature/intent is a lie on top of the rest of the rhetoric people portray for votes. It is up to the people to weigh the truths for their decisions when they vote not a visage of the truth that they want.
@officialmcafee Treasonous words and actions attained our independance. It is not time that will change treasonous words or actions, but, it is time that will tell if it was justified.
If over half of the population believes that our democracy is weakening and that we are at the threshold of an authoritative democracy, why is it that we are still allowing this; still following the lies; still allowing ourselves to be blinded by the small hiding that path?
@createhsitory Kim Jong, not the u.n.
@sarcasm_liberty @PetiteNicoco On top of this there are the issues you stated and these are present because of culture as well. There is more of a call to arms over restroom use and a pointless wall than there is over the care of our veterans.	...Priorities...	Veterans simply aren't seemingly one of them.
@sarcasm_liberty @PetiteNicoco The persistent bashing of free healthcare (medicaid) weighs down the depressed minds of the people I once knew. Some refused care because it is labeled as communist and wrong. One refused because, "if the people I fought for can't, why should I have that privelage."
@sarcasm_liberty @PetiteNicoco My entire thought was over the character limit.		I have met more veterans than I care to meet, who are lively but depressed, spirited but drained of life. They refuse to seek care and would rather hide it until they let go of the mortal coil.
@sarcasm_liberty @PetiteNicoco We are a culture that argues over whether vet care is an abuse of the system vets fought to protect.	Would one not devalue themself when everyone seems to think they're a waste of time, after risking their life for them to do so freely?

In 1960 the vote changed to #Republican.	In 1968 #MLK was shot by a Republican in TN.	The only things that didn't change were the people and the political argument against basic human rights for votes.
@riceman79 In short, yes, then no. However the scope of this question is not one that the position will have much, if any control of. 	On opinion, yes, they are essential. Even an ideal libertarian gvmt needs LE, tho, I do not agree with some of the practices to attain money or other abuses

@TheNewsAddict @KatisSophia @alllibertynews @skau61 @OutnumberedOT @HARRISFAULKNER @AriFleischer @adrienneelrod @JMfreespeech I went up against a lawyer like this as a pro-se defendant.

@itsmycountryto1 @cryptoking213 @dc_healey @MainsheetMeric @alllibertynews @Herbert_L_Reed @JMfreespeech @realDonaldTrump He may not be, but he is also not the president or seeking office.		Trump lied to you and told you what you wanted to hear, not what he could do. I would be mad if I were in your shoes, not defending the person who has regularly proven that he is (and was) part of the swamp.
@joec522 @RealFedParty It has also been the history of our government since the articles of confederation. Congress is made up of (per critical views) lazy aristocrats. WE can change this with our votes.	@Ocasio2018 is a harbinger of this, regardless of her position, if she duely represents her voters
@joec522 @RealFedParty This gave me a good laugh due to the absurdity in its reality. Mainly the part where the president will fight congress to take its power back. 	Personally, I would use it to my advantage until it has served its purpose, THEN push to transfer it back.
@TeaPainUSA If you want a callout to them use #TrumpTrain.
@TeaPainUSA What I am most worried about are the parallels and connections between him and other politicians.
@TeaPainUSA it seems we share a birthday.
@PattyArquette Due to having children... baby shark doo do do do do do.
@joec522 @RealFedParty Either way, congress is still responsible for permission of any budget.
@joec522 @RealFedParty That power is not assured. With the budget, President sets it and Congress (house) still votes. An insightful President can make a major difference because of this issue.

@KatisSophia @TheNewsAddict @alllibertynews @skau61 @OutnumberedOT @HARRISFAULKNER @AriFleischer @adrienneelrod @JMfreespeech Are you sticking up for trump or just trying to be logical? Your aggravation is unstated.
@goldendoekd @RealFedParty This is also a point of @LPNational	@GreenPartyUS @TPPatriots @ReformParty and many others.	It is only a talking point for @GOP and @DNC, minus a few.
@RealFedParty What would work well, is to work the national debt out of existance and work towards a budget that relies on the previous year's income. For this to happen, the power of coin would have to fully be in the hands of responsible representation across the board.
@joec522 @RealFedParty It is refreshing to see someone not blaming the president for this and instead focusing on the correct entity.
@RealFedParty It should. However, to the large majority, it is not fully understood because it does not represent a personal takeaway. Government is seen as "them and their's" and not "ours". It would be hard for anyone to care about something that they are almost explicitly detached from.

@glittercoog @andyzonneveld @Ocasio2018 @BillClinton @POTUS It was durring the election and using campaign funds to start a long term payment towards a matter that was a decade old via a shell company.

@JohnRingoes @andyzonneveld @Ocasio2018 @BillClinton Unfortunately, lieing to the people is not illegal or impeachable. It is a standard operating procedure in government.
@andyzonneveld @Ocasio2018 @BillClinton Trump will almost certainly lie under oath and may already have. He has also conducted witness tampering and blatant obstruction. 	Every person linked to him is acting differently (even some in congress) they all know implications reach further than just perjury.
#QuestionOfTheDay 	You do realize you will have to deal with trump as a successful incumbant in 2020?		This assumes that what he has done can be counted as sucess and that the #trumptrain will not be derailed. 	I'm 80% certain it will be Pence for 2020 and 15% it will be SOTH.
@siano2020 I would assume sharing a lawyer with trump, or any connection with him would be bad, the thing is, if this is true, they arent permenantly deleted, and the mass of them could implicate him on a topic.

@lummox_ict @HughNaylor @conservmillen This only reaffirms my thoughts on the possibility that they were part of a coyote operation. I know from firsthand accounts water is withheld to get money from US counterparts. I have been litterally writing an entire piece on this for a project next month.
@lummox_ict @HughNaylor @conservmillen I am only a former army 91w, what would I know about dehydration.		Also, I must add that the reason they made this journey is not made clear to us, nor is the information about if they did this with or without a coyote. It makes a big difference.
@lummox_ict @HughNaylor @conservmillen It is not a spin. The endangerment aspect lacks appropriate context to assume the parents guilt, however, an agency that regularly deals with these issues is assuredly neglegent in failing to recognize dehydration symptoms that are vastly evident before death.
@cenkuygur @Mediaite Campaign finance payoffs are an abuse of the donor's funds. It's not about the sex, it is about the abuse of funds. The sex issue only shows that the abuse exists, abuse that is part of a larger set of issues.
@lummox_ict @HughNaylor @conservmillen Americans barely get charged with endangerment. Speeding in a car and cutting through traffic with a kid in the back is endangerment that is met with a speeding fine and maybe a reckless driving charge.
@lummox_ict @HughNaylor @conservmillen If it happened to an American citizen they would have given the little girl immediate help as well and all parties water. 	We do not know the situation before they crossed the border. So we shouldn't publically assume endangerment.
@HughNaylor @conservmillen The truth was not hidden, hours in custody does not cause dehydration. Personally, I know that immediate medical care should have been taken and likely would have saved her life in the hours she was in custody.
@IiFairfax @LPNational @LarrySharpe A list of accomplishments like that would require the ability to do something like that. 	This idea is self-defeating.
@ENSWorks @LPNational @LarrySharpe @GreenPartyUS Seeding LP would be beneficial to their goals. Not in absolute representation, but in the increased ability for them to be able to do so themselves in the future.	#CountryOverParty
@ENSWorks @LPNational @LarrySharpe @GreenPartyUS I like the idea, however it is illegal outside of a couple states. 	The two big parties can use this to their advantage as they have and still do where they can. 	The only method is to not run a candidate and promote another. This way there are more available votes and visibility
@QHoward10 @charliekirk11 I see what you did there, but you have to have something in motion before you can redirect it.😁
@timshagg0404 @charliekirk11 This is all politicians and they do this to remain politicians. Remove the extra cash, and many will fight harder.	AOC may be a good example of this. You don't have to agree with what she says to see that she is an outspoken fighter without a shady income.
@charliekirk11 The Republicans don't WANT the wall, extremist Republicans do. If they did, it would already have provisions and would not be going to the wayside. What you have here, along with Yemen, are re-election tactics for issues they don't want, yet, will lose votes because of.
@Desertthorn @PaulaSueBosch1 @KamalaHarris A single city can (in the right conditions) accomplish a minimum wage without harm. Tho, any federal blanket law on this same issue will not be able to account for businesses or people that are impacted negatively.
@Desertthorn @PaulaSueBosch1 @KamalaHarris This is a small-scale example that will not hold true on a full scale. In this example jobs aren't "lost" in a traditional sense, they move to places like Kentucky or Alabama.	A better comparison of effect would be the inclusive car wash industry in New York.

@PoluzziDavid @PaulaSueBosch1 @KamalaHarris Right here where I live we are seeing a battle for employees for pay (over the minimum wage), the companies that pay less have people, but also a higher turnover rate and are understaffed.
@PoluzziDavid @PaulaSueBosch1 @KamalaHarris This would also provide a method for their ultimate monopoly. They are big already, if they pay better and have a tax break, nobody will want to work for the competition. The competition fails.
@createhsitory I believe it is inevitable so long as other countries stay out of the process.
@Liberty_Thunder @ThePrettyEnemy @Ocasio2018 I was going to say that as well. They missed a few steps in their process and did some non lp things. It has to be correctly implemented as a goal, with culture coming to adopt the practice, not dropped like a ton of bricks.
@Liberty_Thunder @ThePrettyEnemy @Ocasio2018 It (should) be the safe way to do so. Like a government run n4p program with direct limitation on the expense of funds soely to that program, would be a good idea for some things. Unlike some of the (n)4p programs we have. Wounded warriors in particular.

@ThePrettyEnemy @Liberty_Thunder @Ocasio2018 That was an actual good read.

@MozUrtOfficial @abrarcho @TheEconomist @neiltyson By not going in the cave, you have essentially not opened the box. It follows the same paradoxical platform. God both exists and does not exist at the same time. (He even throws in the reference to the bear being dead)

@lwsjff @dsheetz @Ocasio2018 In the current climate it is the endgame, the status and paycheck exit from politics or power.	I would personally argue that a president should make attempt to take on a senatorial role at the end of their term and show true committance to their country.
@Ocasio2018 ...

@TessEractica @Bitofhonesty @TheEconomist It is those that wish to press belief or chastise others for not adhering to their view that is the concern. This holds true for theists/atheists and is the precursor to the issue in your statement.	There is a specific reason why the church of FSM exists.
@Bodasion @SeattleSportsPT @TheEconomist Societal norms do provide a structure similar to the ethics provided by religion. 	I am atheist. 	I am also personally conservative and people regularly confuse me with what they view  "a good Christian republican" to be, only to be surprised that I am neither.
@TheEconomist Atheism could almost be defined as a closed system of thought solely towards a person's disbelief in religion.	The term free-thinker relates more to the lack of a religious precursor to any idea that may conflict with it, than to an overall close-minded state of the individual.

@PoluzziDavid @PaulaSueBosch1 @KamalaHarris The assurance that the latter will not occur, when the view of success relies on higher earnings, is not something I would bet against. The likelihood of that cost being passed to the consumer with a lack of competition in their position is high and can cause more issues.
@PoluzziDavid @PaulaSueBosch1 @KamalaHarris This may be true to some extent. However, to a business like Walmart, the wage increase would have to directly reduce the salaries of the people who directly benefit from their profit.

@KamalaHarris An absolute waste. The wall will have large holes even if it is funded, by way of existing treaties over shared bodies of water and by federal wildlife provisions.
@chris_381 @BeavisImposter "Developing brain" Is not a term I would ever use to describe an acceptable use-case scenario for any substance that has a mind-altering effect.	I would hope that much would go as common sense.
@DavidErosenko @LPNational @solarcity 	The risk is government. 	However, one company can turn to many of them with a competitive market (fast) with subsidy and responsible deregulation.
@JaekLoFi @LPNational I think what you are referring to does exist in-part. It is called a utility co-operative.
@LPNational @alllibertynews We are at an impasse where some subsidy will be essential to revert the issues that "we" have created. Pollution and climate issues are a common problem that can harm those without a choice. 	After this issue is resolved, I fully agree on this stance to prevent it's recurrence.
@SarahKSilverman If the nearly direct correlation between conservatives and Christians holds any truth, yes, they definitely suffered this oppression in history.		But, this is not the Roman Empire or 16th-century Spain. 		We should all learn from our history to better our future.
@johniadarola The one response that has been thrown at nearly every single political commentary online, regardless of how appropriate it may be to the discourse of the topic.
@mslporg Gun violence! Remove them all	Reefer madness! Remove it all	Violent immigrants! Remove them all		I'm sensing a trend that we must stop before we get to,	Rights abuses! Remove them all		If we reply,	Corruption! Remove it all		We may end the subversive tactics of fear in politics.
The history of the #korean people through Joeson and the foreign influences of #China, #Japan, #USA, and #Russia in war, to the possible reunification of their country in peace (all within a timeframe of ~120 years) is one to study in amazement of the resilience of their people.
@DrinkTheTea1 I'm sure it had nothing to do with South Korean attempts at peace through showing the north immense kindness and sharing their culture through loud concerts that the northerners could hear even tho they were not allowed to.
Humor is a virtue. https://t.co/Oa4aT475cS
@thistallawkgirl *sniff* 	The soothing smell of maga, with a hint of	*sniff*	Putin's colone?	*sniffffffff*	Intoxicating.
@SenSchumer The proportion of immigrants committing violent crimes are far less to that of the average American.	We should first use money to help stop our own violent crime rate before risking it all for an effort in futility.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP @HouseGOP If it were a foreign country sending troops, this would be acceptable for the president to say and a congressman to sit and take it.	It is not.	I am concerned for both sides, the side that is being childish and the side that has 353 adults that will allow this behavior.

@BeavisImposter It may be true outside of what I have seen and this is a good reason to take the steps towards legalization and accurate study to assure fair legislation (or warrant a lack thereof) by all parties.
@BeavisImposter While high, yes, many are impaired that way. It is not a long-term effect as the stereotype dictates. I am also citing based on what I see, first hand, from regular smokers.
@BeavisImposter @PMAC999 @KamalaHarris Kids already think it is ok and the memory issue is a stereotype.		Legalization will make factual conversation with children about it a possibility, without the fear of a CPS call. This may, in turn, prevent more children from using it.
@jenniferm_q There is a purpose to the age requirement, wisdom. 	Intelligent thinking means nothing when it comes to security, without it.	The first role of the commander in chief IS protecting the nation. Without the wisdom and insight into those that may wish to harm us there is no safety.
@Amitabh_25 @michiokaku We are "attracted" to everything at once. Gravity is very promiscuous.
@QMUbook @michiokaku While you can't directly see them, they are being observed. Like the one at the center of our galaxy.
@athiestopinion @kevinco71053432 @michiokaku *may be infinite* there is no way of knowing as of yet. I would wager that there is a limit to density.
@michiokaku Answer part A: black holes don't suck, things fall in.	B: the event horizon is like a waterfall's edge, you can easily escape the current until you get close and it becomes increasingly difficult, but once you reach the edge escape is lost, you are on the way to the bottom.
@Irish_LJ @GayRepublicSwag @ZanderFromNola I love this answer. Context is important for all things!
@taylom22 The phrase "What's in this drink?"... nowadays it is more synonamous with date rape than pouring a drink and skimping on alcohol.
@chappellboys @GayRepublicSwag @ZanderFromNola This could now be taken as he believes her to be mentally inferior, so he is coaxing her to stay and drink to move in a little closer.	Im aware that the original context when it was written is benign with no intent on being misogynistic.
@taylom22 The meanings of old terms are lost over time to become derogatory.	Bitch and ass are two terms that described animals, that are now considered foul.
So, maybe I am a #Progressive #libertarian pipedream, as an article puts it. 	If a libertarian is to say only free market, tax is only theft, only my way works or nothing goes, that, in essence, becomes authoritarian in and of itself. Freedom can exist amongst other beliefs.
@DesertSkyArts @WhenIs2001 @gardengirlove @PattyArquette @ACLU Every leader will encounter topics they do not fully understand and the role of president is the one most burdened by this. Congress has the ability to make a subcommittee of those that understand. The president must make the best decision from advisors and continually learn.
@WhenIs2001 @DesertSkyArts @gardengirlove @PattyArquette @ACLU I agree as well, but she made a valid point. One that I need to rectify. I know, along with a few others what my knowledge is and where my loyalties and decisions will be placed. Letting the world know the same is a different story.
@Irish_LJ @GayRepublicSwag @ZanderFromNola I don't honestly care about the song, but, you really don't see how these lyrics could be taken that way?	Art requires perspective. With music being art, take it from the perspective of a recent issue brought to light by Bill Cosby's victims. https://t.co/K5JuSWKnTF
@hoyadave @Irish_LJ @GayRepublicSwag @ZanderFromNola Because people don't read or fully pay attention to the lyrics. It is why people think "you are my sunshine" and "(good riddance) time of your life" are good wedding songs.
@DesertSkyArts @DirtyUncleCarl @PattyArquette @ACLU My mediums basically consist of whatever I have near me or have a need for. I'm good with wire, wood, and electronics.
@DesertSkyArts @DirtyUncleCarl @PattyArquette @ACLU It absolutely opened my eyes to a few things.
This needs to end. I do not want the hateful influence of someone else impacting my children. 	If the war for true equality is to be won, we must assure we do not pass racism, sexism, etc. to our future generations or we will only serve to continue the hatred of one another.
Another mother this year in a chic-fil-a playplace (ironically wearing a #MAGA hat) decided that it was ok to tell them "ignore the little black kids in there, black people are too ignorant to pay attention" when my son was hit by another kid climbing down.
At a playground last year, my daughter was playing with a kid that we were keeping an eye out for because his parents were nowhere to be found. His father finally came back only to yell at him for playing with a "little white bitch" and for her to "stick to white people, cunt".
My kids are not taught to discriminate, but the world around us seems to want to push the issue outside of every attempt to the contrary.	How can I teach them equality in a world that fights against it?	Am I the only one who cares to try or notices that it's getting worse?
#race #Equality	So, I just had a disturbing conversation with my daughter about her school.	Apparently, the teacher told her she had to change groups in a dance program because there were, in her words, "too many white kids" in the group and none in another.
@DesertSkyArts @DirtyUncleCarl @PattyArquette @ACLU You're a silversmith now? I'm a "maker" by nature and smithing is something ive always wanted to try my hand at.
@DesertSkyArts @DirtyUncleCarl @PattyArquette @ACLU Being a DJ, mostly in the bar scene, left me with a weird outlook on people without inhibitions. Kind of like an inside view to their true nature, outside of what they portray in public.
@jenniferm_q Has nobody ever heard the term "oldest profession"?
@EricGomezAsia I fully understand.
@DirtyUncleCarl @DesertSkyArts @PattyArquette @ACLU I guess that keeps me from ever being a bartender.
@DirtyUncleCarl @DesertSkyArts @PattyArquette @ACLU Now I remember, very well, who you are. You were pretty mad that I wouldn't take it to play your song. 		You are right, I have received some shady suggestions and offers already. I will not accept. 	Luck, however, is not completely the case I can work hard to mitigate it some.
@Turnip2020 Absolutely! He can be a turnip if he wants. https://t.co/KgRhu6nZGm
@DesertSkyArts @PattyArquette @ACLU Civics are mainly the duty of congress. The president has no true role in civics related decisions if they work as intended. Maybe a better way of putting it is, we are asking an emt to perform brain surgery because the surgeons are busy arguing and the patient will die without.
@DesertSkyArts @PattyArquette @ACLU Also, convincing others that I don't need that to hold office, requires the same knowledge needed to hold office. A catch 22, unless you cheat and I couldn't live with that, so, I will fight from the bottom, in honest against whatever stands in the way.
@DesertSkyArts @PattyArquette @ACLU If I implied in any way that I will not put in the time to continually educate myself, that is not my intent. 		Yes I share some progressive ideas, but my libertarian side is still freedom first. A better America is not one side vs another, but a blend of them all.
@GayRepublicSwag @ZanderFromNola Is the song misogynistic? Absolutely. 	Is it in bad taste to continue playing it? 	No, doesn't anyone pay attention to the lyrics of top 40 anymore?
@GayRepublicSwag @ZanderFromNola It's the need for conflict, controversy, and ratings. Nothing more, nothing less. 	The odd thing is, how we all play into that game.
@DesertSkyArts @PattyArquette @ACLU Tho, a bartender may make a better representitive as a person who listens to people.	Also, if a bartender is taking the place of a brain surgeon because there are none to be found and it's them or death, I will take my chances with them.
@DesertSkyArts @PattyArquette @ACLU Hoop #1: The belief, held by many, that a previously held office will make a good president.
@TheDailyShow Does febreze cut down on the smell of hate, corruption, and missinformation? Asking for a friend...
@Rocky4President Authoritarian is a dirty word.	It is possible in a democratic government and if we are not careful, it doesn't matter what side a citizen is on, they will loose all choice in the matter unless we choose those whom put liberty and country first, no matter the party, now.
Absolutely! https://t.co/ghMAh1xv2v
@mswapan @WorldBank This is the key issue we face internally. The rich can petition to remain rich with the free time to do so, while the poor have to climb almost insurmountable odds to become sucessfull with the struggle to remain alive still burdening them at every turn.

@chris92518826 @PattyArquette @ACLU Also, I live in Alabama. This state votes for religious based law. I would ultimately waste my time in any endeavor here against very religious candidates.
@chris92518826 @PattyArquette @ACLU How so? I do not think Johnson's or Stein's candidacy did anything against Hillary's. If you take them out, the outcome would be the same. I've talked to many independants who voted trump and their now self-recognized incorrect beliefs in him. Politics in a whole led us here.
@jenniferm_q I'm having trouble understanding the necessity of laws on prostitution.	At what point does it affect another person? What is the actual crime? And what differentiates the sale of oneself for a temporary service vs the acts of a "gold digger" aside from transparency of intent?
@eschor @Ocasio2018 This contender will have no problems. As long as it does not impede civil liberties, I would be all for an act to assure the safety of the American people in years to come.
@TheEllenShow @emekannaka Scope is everything.
@JacobAWohl Crimes and their severity are based directly on their intent, not value, outside of theft.	If you pay someone $1 to kill someone or $1mil to give them a hard time, there is a big difference in punishment.
@KamalaHarris I hear they have opened a few outreach centers, too bad we still have to assure the big purple, or blue, or -orange- guy (whatever color he is today) doesn't eliminate half of us.

@VpBeet @realDonaldTrump I'm left thinking "what does embroidery have to do with this?"	Just because they can't find it on top of the folded material, doesn't mean it doesn't blatantly exist underneath.
@DirtyUncleCarl I moved for the same reason and thank you!
@DirtyUncleCarl No compete issues in a contract with him and slashed tires. It was not a good situation breaking away for myself. I also had my first child shortly after.	What about you? The geotags say you're in Georgia?
@PattyArquette @ACLU This is one of the many reasons I want to be president. Pardoning individuals who are done a heavy injustice by our system would (after due research) be set free.	I believe in justice, but this is most certainly not justice.	Common sense is a must.

@officialmcafee If you talk to your drugs, there may be only one outcone: come down after being high af.
@michiokaku You can not use the scientific method on "God". 	But, you can use it on "the belief in God" and whether or not it exists with a lack of external influence. 		That being said, It's still a deeply personal choice that should be made by the individual and not forced by others.
@amillionwaysdc Then, I guess I'm doing the right thing.
The first novel I ever read was "Eyes of the Dragon" by @StephenKing 	Reading it for a second time nearly 23 years later leads me to wonder. How is this not a movie yet?
@NikkiGlaser Cutest breakfast.
@LEAFSFAN202 @alllibertynews @LPNational I've been seeing a lot more of this lately, in public and online.

@pattonoswalt He may have missed the one about the "bill on Capitol hill".
@artcarden Feels like it here.
@KLeeO29 No, you can be a conservative or a liberal and still believe in freedom.
@DirtyUncleCarl I haven't heard that in a long time. Where do you know me from?
@nsarwark The ultimate sign that our government has done the best it can for it's people, is when congress convenes only a couple times a year and the president can get bored of golf without question.

@dammit_rick @SnowBiAuthor Same here, I'm from the dmv area.
@SnowBiAuthor I was referring to the normal use of the act with bills, but I wonder now if that is something that can occur after confirmation votes, in case the president noticed an error in presenting the candidate.
@teamfastpad @psychdr100 All I could think of was super troopers when seeing this.
@psychdr100 If we blame video games for gun violence do we blame shows like ghost adventures for this?
@SnowBiAuthor This is one that an effective nonpartisaned president could fully enforce with the power of veto.
@RonKirbyFan The only means to that outcome relies on a thing called CRISPR. 	We have come to a point in humanity where we can potentially modify life's source code, and we still don't have equality for what exists.	GATTACA was sci-fi, but, in good fashion, it is becoming a plausible reality.
@KnighthawksJP @SenGillibrand I think you mean Pence.
@SenGillibrand Let me rephrase.	Our future is:	Devoid of bias for any person or group over another.	Equal in rights, equal in protection of those rights.	Powered by our belief in one another.		It will be a start.

@Muttonchap It was because of him that I know about it. We all learn and nobody can know everything at all times. I like that he was absolutely honest about things he didn't know. I will take that honesty over lies to cover that fact any day.

@ARacistYordle @kellycarey @Kica333 I've got a cabinet full of it from the dollar store. They cost me about $30 over the past two years. If you're single, they double as cereal bowls or parts containers. Just check for parts before pouring cereal...
@Kica333 Standard issue for a parent over 30.
@Muttonchap I see what you did there.	A leppo, or Aleppo?
@Muttonchap I prefer Joe. Recently, after the passing of my grandfather (William), I've been going by William more often in his honor.
@Muttonchap Hopefully that history will show facts and honesty about what I stand for in light of the missinformation that is prevelant everywhere you turn.
@Muttonchap You would think in an encyclopedia a fact would be relevant, but, this is not how it works.
@Muttonchap That was attempted by multiple people. I think they cited the fec website and my personal one. However there is a single moderator saying that there must be a news article to make the information relevant.
@Muttonchap Also, this is a way to understand how people think and feel about subjects and their view of the problems they face. Something that (I think) most politicians forget is necessary to even begin to represent anyone.
@Muttonchap If you can find better ways to spend time in the bathroom, taking a ride, waiting on a school bus, etc. I am all ears to help this campaign.

@justinamash @POTUS I believe mr. Jinping wishes for free trade deals where they come. This means that, economicly, China's tariffs will hold the long term upper hand in this dispute and will eventually hurt us on trade with other countries.

Some things that often confuse me is that some Republicans use the welfare system and don't believe in it, yet are entitled enough to claim immigrants are stealing from us by using it.	Hipocracy is not good politics.

@redsteeze A fighter may only make things more polarized than they are now. That may be good for the party, but not for the country.
@BernieSanders By we, I am assume that he is referring to "us all, as fellow countrymen/women" and questioning why even those that are affected by these issues still root for them to continue by voting for those that will, or, disregarding their power as a voter altogether.

@Rothbardian1627 @realDonaldTrump He confuses the federal government with the whole of America. Realistically they are removing taxes to the rich, while ultimately charging the rest of America more, for a short term raise of income with a potential long term loss. This is not a tax write off business loss.
@DOGDEWD @thiafinart @realDonaldTrump The industry passes components between companies. A total cut of all tariffs in trade for a minimal import/export fee would increase jobs by allowing raw material and components to be used and traded more with other countries creating more demand for cheaper american product.
@realDonaldTrump Trying to justify legitimate theft from your own countrymen to increase federal income is deplorable. 	Making America Jobless Again.

@Erudition_lost @LMPSEBRING @alllibertynews @AP4Liberty @TheLibRepublic I dont know what your statement intended, but, I can assure you, prescription painkillers are definately chemically addictive.
@Erudition_lost @LMPSEBRING @alllibertynews @AP4Liberty @TheLibRepublic I fully agree. It is more cost than it is a benefit to society for reasons that make no sense.
@Erudition_lost @LMPSEBRING @alllibertynews @AP4Liberty @TheLibRepublic It must be a VERY loose interpretation. I see where parts can be misconstrued as martial law, but I see nothing that states a total temporary forfeiture of legal matters to military operations nationwide.
@Erudition_lost @LMPSEBRING @alllibertynews @AP4Liberty @TheLibRepublic The "works perfectly in a vacuum" idea.	The libertarian ideas if implemented incorrectly could negatively shock the very system it hopes to help. Instead, my idea is to work on the system, as it is, and inject liberty one step at a time.
@Erudition_lost @LMPSEBRING @alllibertynews @AP4Liberty @TheLibRepublic But yes, legalization would cut down not only on costs but dependence on some prescription painkillers and anti-nausea medicines.
@Erudition_lost @LMPSEBRING @alllibertynews @AP4Liberty @TheLibRepublic This is set for appropriations (funding). I have not seen any reference to the act allowing martial law. If you could point where you found this in this very lengthy bill, it would be appreciated.	https://t.co/RXU0FBMct2
@Erudition_lost @LMPSEBRING @alllibertynews @AP4Liberty @TheLibRepublic It's all good. I hope only to help people understand how this setup works. It is imperative, not only, if I want honest votes for myself, but for a clarity on any other candidate's goals or promises.
@RonKirbyFan @realDonaldTrump Maybe that's what he was insinuating?
@Erudition_lost @LMPSEBRING @alllibertynews @AP4Liberty @TheLibRepublic Martial law can only be declared by congress.

@Erudition_lost @LMPSEBRING @alllibertynews @AP4Liberty @TheLibRepublic The president can't legalize, however the ability to influence the scheduling is something they can do, it would then be on the states' (if any) that specify this separately.
@LMPSEBRING @alllibertynews @AP4Liberty @TheLibRepublic I'm not sure what you mean by required reading, but, I'm by far not delusional enough to think that politicians aren't getting more than their salary. If things were done as intended this would be fair compensation for politicians.
@treylw89 @71RepublicMedia @alllibertynews @LPNational @LarrySharpe @officialmcafee @AP4Liberty @adamkokesh @OnTheIssuesOrg Ironically, the term common sense is not viewed with common sense. :-/
@LMPSEBRING @alllibertynews @AP4Liberty @TheLibRepublic I'm trying to tell you that the provided data was not complete, or fully accurate, so I helped make it that way.

@greennoblue @saint__nobody @NateSiems @jb_2_me @Ocasio2018 No minimum wage IS a fair wage in practice, not theory.	We already subsidize school, that will not likely ever change. What can change is taking that subsidy and directing more efforts to assure effectiveness.	Common sense gun laws != more strict gun laws.
@greennoblue @saint__nobody @NateSiems @jb_2_me @Ocasio2018 I think you forget that we live in a country with other people. I take a stance that makes sense to the future of this country and its people. I will not dillude that to conform to an extreme view. Not even to humor a troll.
@treylw89 @71RepublicMedia @alllibertynews @LPNational @LarrySharpe @officialmcafee @AP4Liberty @adamkokesh @OnTheIssuesOrg I support common sense laws to protect people from harm of violent offenders.	I do not support laws that prohibit ownership otherwise.	I do recognize that some firearms and weapons may not be good for general personal protection and should require a special license. I.e. an RPG.
@treylw89 @71RepublicMedia @alllibertynews @LPNational @LarrySharpe @officialmcafee @AP4Liberty @adamkokesh @OnTheIssuesOrg I do want to further that on my site. However, my hosting package only allows a couple pages for a price and I've not kept up with PHP MySQL and html5 (or had the time to script).
@LMPSEBRING @alllibertynews @AP4Liberty @TheLibRepublic President is $400k in office with a 50k expense account. Pension would be the average of executive level I (around $200k)	Congress is $174k in office and see the picture for the rest. https://t.co/UaYtocVK80
@LMPSEBRING @alllibertynews @AP4Liberty @TheLibRepublic I originally questioned this payscale and length. I understand now that if a politician is honest (the real goal) it is necessary. 	As well, this data is not correct and needs about 5 asterisks.
@treylw89 @71RepublicMedia @alllibertynews @LPNational @LarrySharpe @officialmcafee @AP4Liberty @adamkokesh @OnTheIssuesOrg I am a gun owner. 	I love my country and will protect it, as I vowed to before, whether it is from foreign or domestic. 	Country first also means taking arms to defend it from tyranny, and so less than we can assure a departure in humanity from that course, I will remain armed.
@Crockpot1994 Seems legit. Tho the irony in their mocking of trump is that a hockey puck can cause serious damage!
@greennoblue @saint__nobody @NateSiems @jb_2_me @Ocasio2018 I do not need to be a total stooge to be a libertarian. The destination is individual freedom, in whichever evolving path and necessary step that takes.	I will happily trade minor meddling for more people healthy and able to enjoy their freedom.
@greennoblue @saint__nobody @NateSiems @jb_2_me @Ocasio2018 Does the movie and music industry still exist and profit amidst free p2p sharing?	This step opens many more doors to libertarian ideology. We do not force others to do as us, and as a libertarian (specially) implementation of solely one view (even lp) becomes authoritarian.

I'm personally conservative. I just function with logic and reason enough to be able to see both sides at once.
@NateSiems @jb_2_me @saint__nobody @Ocasio2018 You hit a very big nail on the head.	Free healthcare eliminates some of the need for itself by allowing people to get regularly immunized for free, this can cut down on the number of visits for people in industries like this.
@Ocasio2018 Whether you are for or against #MedicareForAll she brings a valid point to the table.	However, in this, it is suprising that they do not have free healthcare already, as their's is a job of service to the country.

@DanWheatley4 @SarahKSilverman Almost certainly these funds would be cash or foreign holdings. He has "property" in many places that he can use to launder this income. He may not have been very rich before the election, or hiding returns due to paying less than the middle class, but now, its anyone's guess.
@SarahKSilverman That's my thing! I'm seeing my country spiral, so my vision of something to do would be to try and take the one position that can steer it in a good direction. As I figured, Congress is now the right makeup, it is time we find the right person to get them to work together.
@realDonaldTrump is this what you were referring to?	It seems odd that you had a seemingly vested interest after the midterms to disregard absentee ballots.	#NC09 republican campaign took absentee ballots from elderly democrat voters to "turn in for them"
When I said that the #metoo movement would hold consequences. This is what I was referring to. Awareness is key, but the disregard of common sense, rights, and due process on public opinion are quickly taking its toll on the credibility that is duly sought.
I find it interesting that the #CrookedHillary email issue has led to the #MuellerInvestigation, which took #Manafort and #MichaelCohen turned them and started the #Collusion #WitchHunt that in reality is implicating #TraitorTrump.	This would make a good dramatic-thriller movie.

@dorightforall06 @RepThomasMassie I wonder where the assumption that people don't need money for other things comes from. Yes, you could live your life with free healthcare and food, but what about the means to be able to go to the store or doctor? What about a life that entails more than being alive and eating.

@RonKirbyFan .....and now is when the tape will go over my camera....
@RonKirbyFan That is usually true for all countries. Men are naturally more aggressive.	Outside of a few countries like Korea and Japan, the average is around 3:1
@RonKirbyFan I remember seeing something recently about him using the info against other countries for persuasive reasons. (Extortion)
@RonKirbyFan @alankurtzpro The double-edged sword I speak of it the power this knowledge has given him to influence to his advantage.
@RonKirbyFan @alankurtzpro I don't think they did leak them, but, the withholding itself was for good reason. Respect for the dead, and the families left alive.
@RonKirbyFan In the movies, in reality, conviction, even by confession, has an accuracy of 1 out of 8 in some areas, in others, nearly half are false convictions. Most often it is the district attorney that pushes for a guilty plea.
@RonKirbyFan I would pardon Snowden, but, I would also stipulate a condition that he may never hold a government position or office, due to his potential involvement with foreign entities in the time he has been gone.
@RonKirbyFan @alankurtzpro Wiki Leaks is a double-edged sword. Some things should remain unknown. Like the pictures of 9\11 involving human remains that the media agreed unanimously not to show.
@realDonaldTrump Donald, you like tv.		Here is a clip explaining tariffs and the way they affect the economy, mainly, how your policy affects our industry, with a few laughs in between.		https://t.co/YjMltpoVkT
@RonKirbyFan I do a spread method.	Take stories from multiple outlets and take into account which way they lean to know where they will exaggerate. And find the truth in between.
@RonKirbyFan Maybe on this "sourcing", an explanation of the account and how the finding was derived would be a key on the honesty behind the findings. 	My findings on the $2k info I provided came from multiple unrelated people who trusted me enough to converse about their dillemma.
@RonKirbyFan They like to single source. That is rarely truth.
@RonKirbyFan The only way to get this info is from "sources" because naming a source would likely get them deported or killed.
@RonKirbyFan Stories of rape, robbery, murder, and trafficking are not uncommon there.	The issue in corroborating accounts, is that it is our border patrol doing this as well. There are also certain officials who allow payment (usually $2000) to escort certain people for crossing.
@RonKirbyFan Sometimes a first hand source can play a vital role in truth. 	It is how I know for sure what happens on the border. Multiple first hand accounts (sources) giving roughly the same stories.
@RonKirbyFan Would you like to be the neighborly views correspondent?		https://t.co/hI0BB5EOlU
@RonKirbyFan I'll figure it out this weekend and start one, if I can.
@GundamLjmu @LPNational Such elegant wording by myself when I'm busy and taking short breaks. Sorry for you people's heads exploding while reading the (general) statement.
@GundamLjmu @LPNational This is what I would think. Yet, there are many loud and persistent voices (in the party?) that say otherwise, and from what I hear while talking about the party to people in general is generally that view.
@RonKirbyFan Support. I'm running into barriers from the start. Money is necessary. 	Actual news sources must cover you. Hell, even wikipedia will deny you unless it's a "public interest" in leau ot fact. I've been added and taken off multiple wikipedia articles repetitively.
@BradSizemore3 @2020fight Ooh, it is, but the shadow of doubt (in my opinion) should be to innocence. Proof of guilt is a must, and no amount of conversation can change solid evidence, only help in the defence of it, and all sides may as for discovery to be fair. I'm not a lawyer but I do study for pro se
@RonKirbyFan The unfortunate part of this is that there were 1700 candidates in 2016 for president.
@BradSizemore3 @2020fight No, if this became law, some innocent convictions could occur.
@2020fight Unfortunately he does have the right. There needs to be an ammendment to that power, that simply adds "congress may vote for a ruling by the supreme court or the SC may initiate itself to vote to overturn a pardon if there is a clear conflict of interest in the use of this power"
Trump and the office he holds should not be attained by an individual of his nature. We, the people, have the responsibility of voting to prevent these issues. The press has the responsibility of sharing honest information to shed the light we need to make informed decisions.
Truth. We can not charge a foreign entity tax. That is litterally against our founding principals of taxation without representation. A tariff is a charge out companies must pay, and is used to control business. https://t.co/WmMIfOBpml
@schager_c @LPNational Choice. There are components of abortion that law cannot provide for. Alabama law is now fully attempting prevention of abortion even in cases of rape or death of the mother

#QuestionOfTheDay #HealthForAll 	Will I lose my job at an insurance company?		It is not likely, free healthcare does not eliminate the market, it just forces it to adapt like the movie/music industry and rental market did with free and low-cost internet-based alternatives.
@dorightforall06 @RonKirbyFan @Ocasio2018 I really think now would be a perfect time to start a podcast on these things. I'm just not familiar with that area outside of regular radio broadcast.	That aside, list away and I'll add what I can.
@dorightforall06 @RonKirbyFan @Ocasio2018 Your welcome. I hope you the best. Personally, I may soon have a job at an agency as well. I wouldn't have applied if I feared the industry's capitulation.
@dorightforall06 @RonKirbyFan @Ocasio2018 I would like to paraphrase this for my question of the day if you and  Kirby don't mind.
@dorightforall06 @RonKirbyFan @Ocasio2018 Free healthcare cannot possibly cover all areas or personal preferences. Example: It is almost guaranteed that elitists will pay a premium for something that appears to be better than the rest and will look down on public healthcare.
@dorightforall06 @RonKirbyFan @Ocasio2018 Take free online movies vs rentals and purchases. The market still exists and grows in spite of free or very low cost alternatives being easily available.
@dorightforall06 @RonKirbyFan @Ocasio2018 Insurance companies will not perish. That is a misconception that is used to push the opposition's agenda. They will only lose some clients and be forced to provide a better service than what is federally available. They would still have a market.
@Dennis_35901 Would you, in this scenario, be considered right in your actions or the one who caused the problem?
@Dennis_35901 At the gate, you tell them that they aren't really allowed and shut the gate on them. They get even more aggravated and start throwing small rocks over your gate. You reply by maceing their young children first so they will stop while claiming "I told you so".
@Dennis_35901 You start talking to everyone and tweeting about how these people are worthless criminals. You still assert that abused people come first and that you care. They notice the conversations and tweets online, yet they need a safe place. They walk across town and get to the gate.
@Dennis_35901 This is only meant as a like situation.	Say you are offering rooms in your mansion (rented) for anyone abused and needs to get away to a safe place. 	You find out there are several on the way to try and rent one of those rooms.
@Dennis_35901 That is your personal place of residence. It is not a direct representation or in any way comparable to that of our border, outside of being a barrier. 	I can, however, compare this situation to that for the sake of understanding.
@KatMurti I have never been ok with the border situation when I found out what was actually going on while training as a 91w at Ft Sam with foreign nationals. The actions are far beyond what we stand for as a country. This situation is only an inflated lite version of what happens.
@arlethapappas @realDonaldTrump Thanks, I'll need all the luck and support I can get, along with a lot of hard work, going from unknown to at least having a chance at primaries without being controversial enough to get recognition.
@arlethapappas @realDonaldTrump Haha	No need, while it was misplaced in me, it accurately represented the current climate.
@arlethapappas @realDonaldTrump I dont take many things personally, if I did, I would immediately disclude myself from any attempt at his seat in 2020.
@Dennis_35901 Also, no, the expectation is not that they endure it, it is that they recognize the lack in severity of the "assault". 	What would you consider more powerful?	Someone who can look at a pebble being thrown and laugh at the attempt, or someone that will reply with force?
@Dennis_35901 Absolutely, retribution was the intent and it's a common political tactic that our country uses a lot. Cause an issue that will provoke a bad response, use that response to say they started it, and the action sought is attainable.	To cause action against our own is deplorable.
@robzon @WilleumP @LPNational I think it is funny that the shift occurred in the patent system yo do this, where it was originally to protect the individual from theft. Now, we have patent purchasers that use them to steal from others, legally or broad range patents that keep regular people from attaining one
@WilleumP @LPNational In particular regulations that occur now, once a company is large enough to afford lobbyists, take affect to prevent competition.
@WilleumP @LPNational The current practice of having a large monopoly or oligopoly is a bad situation.	However, libertarian methods can provide the means of which competition, both for services provided and wages for those helping provide it, can thrive without the need for intervention in most cases.
@arlethapappas @realDonaldTrump I think your aggression is misplaced in me. I'm in opposition of the cult. 	It's a joke. Like saying "I'm not as think as you drunk I am".

There is a simple solution that reduces the opioid epidemic, leads to a steep reduction in crime, less spending on prisoners, and creates jobs nationwide.	Decrimininalize cannabis.
#QuestionOfTheDay 	Why do you follow people who oppose your view?		Opposition is important to progress.	So long as they are not purely confrontational (trolling), an opposing view can help one see defects and question the truths you may be blind to, based on your own perspective.
#Mexico #Border 	I never figured I would have to spell out the obvious.	Many are claiming an invasion, and that border patrol is justified in its response.	Intentional use of force on another country's non combative citizens is an act of war.
@LesterLexxx @DisabledResist @francescatututu Sounds like a new insane clown posse song.
@DisabledResist For those of us who do not prefer to use profanities often, a simple	#VoteNoOn45 tag leading to a twitter trend would work.
@footofgov Not limited to preventative care, but each section has to be looked at separately in part of the whole.
@footofgov Cover preventative care once a year checkup. (3.2 billion currently if every single person used it)	This cost could be negotiated much lower with higher volume.	I suspect this alone would cost around 1 billion or less after all is said and done.
@LPNational @alllibertynews Proselytism.
@jess_bbg @Yeen125 @LPNational The condition of "our/we" in this context refers to Americans. We can be (and are regularly held) guilty by association.	I view fellow Americans as a family. Sure, there are some assholes in it, but they matter all the same unless they diavow themselves by choice or aggression.
@footofgov By all means, you are correct. A full single payer system based on the current figures would be doomed to failure. 	A partial system would work out on essentials and incentives to drive the cost down. Leaving more to opt in to a federal minimum but assured healthcare option.
@TheGwenhwyfar @BrokenByFates @Shalin090 @BBCWorld If I were on the side of them trying to get in or leave? Either way, a full attempt to de-escalate the issue would commence first. On the Mexican side I would ask my troops to take a few steps back to avoid the rocks. Maybe even diffuse hostilities by throwing a football back.
@TheGwenhwyfar @BrokenByFates @Shalin090 @BBCWorld I can easily forgive someone throwing rocks. Maybe that's what separates us, I have humility and compassion for others.	Also, you clearly bypassed the beginning of my statement to push your own (agenda?).
@footofgov Where it comes to partisaned views on these, almost any would do.		The one most used, I've noticed, would currently be universal/free/federal healthcare, even tho insurance itself is of a socialistic nature and used regularly.
@Ocasio2018 This is why I miss Jon Stewart.
@footofgov The unfortunate part of our current divide entails that any socialistic idea, no matter it's fit and role in our democracy is regularly seen as fully communistic.
@TheGwenhwyfar @BrokenByFates @Shalin090 @BBCWorld Let's take this a step further, not to say this is what they are doing, only to express my point.	They throw rocks, so let's not kill them, let's kill their families so they want to stop throwing rocks. Let's avoid conflict bu doing something to antagonize further conflict.
@Dennis_35901 If that was the case, I would fully side with you. However, this is an attempt at legal means of entry that was disregarded intentionally to provoke an issue. The tear gas is another provocation tactic. If our gaurd cant handle small rocks, how TF are we a superpower?
@TheGwenhwyfar @BrokenByFates @Shalin090 @BBCWorld The canister of gas is just an overheated soda right?	I would ask what lengths people will go to feel justified in their decisions, but I'm seeing the conclusive answer to a rhetorical question, repeated on every event through 	proselytism and delusion.

@markIcutler @Shalin090 @BrokenByFates @TheGwenhwyfar @BBCWorld It didnt bother me as much as I thought it would. However putting a newborn or toddler in there would be a completely different story. We should not further tarnish ourselves with acts of cruelty.
@Shalin090 @BrokenByFates @TheGwenhwyfar @BBCWorld This is true (7 child deaths in 2017), however, if they are legitimately seeking refuge, wouldn't they, in effect, be endangering their children more by not doing what they are doing now?
@PrivatizeEdu @michaelmalice Well, since the NRA promotes and encourages rifles on a scientific basis, they should...*thinks*... ooh crap...
@TimGilpin2 @PrivatizeEdu @DefoNotNotGay @michaelmalice Before its mentioned about my answer, I am aware that co2 emission is not climate change in a whole. That would be absurd.
@TimGilpin2 @PrivatizeEdu @DefoNotNotGay @michaelmalice Bet and I'll humor the textbook question. (I'll refer to just co2)	Micro is the small scale. (Ice sheet melting and releasing trapped co2 or a car burning fuel)	Macro is the large scale. (Cumulative effects of this co2 on the whole system)	You can start.

@MaryLuigi1919 @PrivatizeEdu @DefoNotNotGay @michaelmalice By simple logic, it takes a basic understanding of a topic to avoid misinformation about it. 	Another person mentioned a recent nobel prize winner William Nordhaus. This is a perfect example of general knowledge of climatology vs detailed. I highly suggest you watch the link.
@CheckYourBiases @PrivatizeEdu @DefoNotNotGay @michaelmalice His basis of that is on certain conditions. He also states his research does not include tipping points, as he does not [yet] fully understand that.
@CheckYourBiases @PrivatizeEdu @DefoNotNotGay @michaelmalice https://t.co/CPy1LzBxDA	A good watch for information on the topic.	From the quoted researcher.
@PrivatizeEdu @MaryLuigi1919 @DefoNotNotGay @michaelmalice I don't approve of all she has to say, but, I respect her choices far more than some others, specifically on this topic that needs a broad range of input in order to correct. 	No person is infallible or right at every moment, even myself.
@PrivatizeEdu @MaryLuigi1919 @DefoNotNotGay @michaelmalice I definately understand the sarcasm, but no, I would never want a politician to do that. They must make good use of advisors and have the ability to differentiate good vs bad information. 	Cortez is not a science person, but, I have yet to see her follow missinformation.
@MaryLuigi1919 @PrivatizeEdu @DefoNotNotGay @michaelmalice @realDonaldTrump Back to the topic, diversionary tactics aside.	Do you believe the person you follow has a basic understanding of science, let alone global warming?
@MaryLuigi1919 @PrivatizeEdu @DefoNotNotGay @michaelmalice @realDonaldTrump Do I need to state the obvious?	Looking at a figure and making someting up to explain it without an understanding of what that figure entails or contains is problematic.	At least you're transparent and consistent, I will give you that.
@MaryLuigi1919 @PrivatizeEdu @DefoNotNotGay @michaelmalice After going through your profile, I've noticed you're a follower and your ideas reflect those of @realDonaldTrump. Tell me, has he shown any understanding of the subject? Does clean coal ring a bell? Yet, as he posts his rhetoric, people blindly follow.
@MaryLuigi1919 @PrivatizeEdu @DefoNotNotGay @michaelmalice This is an example of what I'm talking about, a complete lack of basic understanding. You cant expect a politician to have specific knowledge of everything, it's not possible.	https://t.co/KQ1LGBkt3h
@michaelmalice Also true. I can't stand watching people who would willingly spread misinformation and the followers who buy into it. Representatives and leaders should be responsible and honest in their position of influence.
@PrivatizeEdu @DefoNotNotGay @michaelmalice We need politicians in office that understand science enough to make  informed decisions not just those that can talk a good game and make people believe falsehoods.	She may not be a climatologist, but at least she has a basic understanding.
@ArianaGrande The unfortunate and fortunate part is that this is an unadulterated view into the minds of people. 	If you want to see the rationality of a person, look at their social media, where they will usually and publically display hateful statements.

@BetteMidler The replies... people do get paid for specific talents. If we dont like the money spent to them on those talents, don't see the movies. We litterally pay to see these people and complain that they earn so much. https://t.co/bmVtMtNk6R

@Dennis_35901 I kind of wonder the reaction we would have if foreign governments started doing the same to American illegals. (Which for a first time this year the outgoing has exceeded the incoming)
@P_C_Bryant @michaelmalice Ooh, the issue with global warming is not the absorbed heat, it's the atmospheric conditions that prevent  solar heat from escape. Also, a white pavement would cause many issues for drivers.
@PrivatizeEdu @DefoNotNotGay @michaelmalice I often wonder why people feel the need to go into personal discredidation of another to subvert things they choose not to recognize as truth.
@P_C_Bryant @michaelmalice I certainly hope that is sarcasm.
@bolderthanu @Thedude67111 @RepThomasMassie ... Columbine ring a bell?
@RepThomasMassie Must be stealing ideas from @LarrySharpe...	I do not believe this is a good idea. Far more issues could/would arise from this than it will solve.
@Ispeak4you You do know the shooting was over a pair of limited edition shoes right?	Our culture of fear towards firearms is what made this incident possible. I know this to be the specific truth.
If we continue to persue the path of disarm and fear of firearms for political reasons, we create a bigger problem and cause the furthered loss of life. We need culture and law, side by side, to provide safety through common sense and honest knowledge.
Bravery that could prevent these issues.	The consideration to use a firearm out of anger would be far more weighted in the mind of an individual if they knew there would be a response. Today, in our culture of fear, that response is rare, bravery subsides to panic.
The shooting was over shoes, this is also very common. 	The sheer lack of any threat leads people to think that a firearm holds more power. If we ever disarm americans this will become a larger issue. We have a culture that leads us to fear instead of bravery.
I hate to think that I could have prevented the shooting at the mall last night. Had I gone as planned I would have been right there at the time of the shooting and could have intervened before others were injured.
@sahluwal @arlethapappas This should never be the case in how an officer should act. He failed at his attempt to earn a citation payment. He should have left the driver with a verbal warning.
Events like this should never happen. 	You need evidence of a violation to enforce a law.	Plain and simply put, this officer clearly shows he is either poorly trained, racist, or pulling a department funding scam. The comments by the second officer lead me to suspect the latter. https://t.co/5NkWbNsD5o

@TheEconomist We have/had an issue with intervention and expansion. Also our fight on communism for political reasons greatly hurt relations with them.
@RonKirbyFan That would be party based, some parties dont use primaries. Independants don't have to at all. People should be able to run for multiple offices (within reason) however, loose any vote that may double their presence on a single ballot or votes can be cast only for one instance.
While not illegal, I think this is quite inappropriate.	Changing laws to meet the needs of a single person is never good, and represents the things we should not allow in government.	In this instance it's not bad, but, it shows how easy it can be to accommodate incumbants. https://t.co/5gEcG0mhZQ

@JeremyMcLellan Ooh, please, joke that I will get a raise soon.
We are seeing an emergence of factions in the duopoly. The unfortunate side effect of this being that both factions are leading towards absolutes. Absolute capitolism and absolute communism. Balance is Key, even moreso than ever, libertarian is key to providing this balance.
@Lauren38060467 @Trump454545 @edmgail1944 @FoxNews I call it nothing. I use all news sources, recognizing their biases and moving on for a full picture.		Please note that American interests do not control bbc, al Jazeera, or other foreign news, yet they do say the general same things.
@jenniferm_q 	I'm very much enjoying your podcasts. Level headed and realistic views based on libertarian views.	 	Also, Apu, really? The #Simpsons has the opposite effect on stereotypes and breaks them often!

@mjHauzer @alllibertynews @Adreith32 @LPNational Working it's way up to resolve these issues.
@LPNational Freedom first in all decisions.
@amicusets @KatMurti @ckhorowitz The extreme of libertarianism only works in a vacuum. The goals however provide a voice in the direction of freedom. The other two options are leaning towards authoritarian practices and without a third party intervention, we will continually move that way.
@TagSherman @SilentTreat @Lacish_Ael_Dae @KatMurti We do need to get along and provide for the most freedom in that idea. It will not go away and is supported by a majority of citizens. Finding a libertarian compromise to this will provide the best for those that are being represented.
@bruckerlaw @KatMurti Freedom of ourselves entails the acceptance of freedom for another.	Per core libertarian ideology, at minimum, a more open boarder is ideal for free trade.
@platypusrex256 @KatMurti He sides with authoritarian beliefs and practices. I couldn't see how any libertarian could side with him politically.
@KatMurti This is an issue of the party. Many abuse its meaning, many dont understand it either. This allows any person to claim libertarian in order to undermine the parties goal, whereby they diminish any will for others to vote for a member of the party.

@officialmcafee @GeorgeMcIntyre_ There needs to be a good reason to vote outside the duopoly, enough to topple the minimal barriers in place. The libertarian premise is awesome, however, pandering to the extremes of it, limits its ability to get votes that could otherwise be easily attained.
@mattwymore1 @officialmcafee Not true, it is easy to believe this with the methods in place to discredit some votes, but the opposite is true. If there are overwhelming third party numbers the whole system can be uprooted.
@GIANYCoin @officialmcafee That would be reliant on congress, not potus.
@officialmcafee This is surrender. To surrender is to give up on your freedom, to fight in the shadow of tyranny is to assure freedom. 	If we are to make change in this system towards freedom, we must first be a part of it. Belief in a goal must also encapsulate the means to achieve it.
@u_kuo @realDonaldTrump My gut instinct says it shows he claimed a net loss for the year and paid little to no taxes, which would discredit his entire rhetoric. This may serve as a basis for a real audit that he cant pay off the auditor to overlook.

@realDonaldTrump This is not a sign that we should go with any party over another. This is a sign that we need reform now.	Our process is riddled with methods to favor one side over another, that is not democracy. For better or worse we need accurate representation of the voter.

@alisawoodard6 @_LoveLike_JESUS The unfortunate part of this is that God was never intended in our union or included to start.

@The_JJAllen @landstromboli @MomsUnlabeled @MaplesM78 @abc7greg @ABC7Jory Absolutely. 	"Bear arms" does not soely include firearms. 	It also does not provide for people to ignore common sense or use that right against one another. That is where law must be enacted and try and hinder this issue, not our rights.
@foreach_as @MaplesM78 @abc7greg @ABC7Jory If we reduce fear, we reduce the potency of the firearm on that basis and occasionally, its use. 	Without fear, we will also have more responsible carriers.
@MaplesM78 @landstromboli @MomsUnlabeled @The_JJAllen @abc7greg @ABC7Jory If my statement insinuated that gun laws will not help, that was not the intent. Common sense laws both allow us personal protection and make it harder for guns to be with the wrong people. 	The law itself can't eliminate violence, only provide a hurdle, change relies on culture.
@Trumpswingman @artchirino @LauraLoomer I understand that, completely.	I am not the best talker, tho, I am one person who refuses one sided views.

@BSenak93 @MaplesM78 @abc7greg @ABC7Jory Not helpless, our current culture of fear and miseducation of firearms makes the power of using one far greater. If we eliminate them altogether, this power becomes greater. 	If we, instead, face the reason it's being used, we stand a far greater chance of halting these issues.
@landstromboli @MomsUnlabeled @The_JJAllen @MaplesM78 @abc7greg @ABC7Jory Special interests halt common sense laws for sales.	The constitution protects our rights to bear arms, not for death and destruction, but for the absolution of freedom in the face of tyranny.

#Veterans #Peace #ENDviolance #freedom #HonorThroughAction #AmericaFirst #SuicidePrevention #purpose
Take no more lives, including your own. The time for death is over.	Let us not forget our fallen.	Let us, instead, honor them and make their sacrifice worthwhile.	Let us become the voice of reason against hatred and divide.	Let us fight for peace and unify our country once again.
#OperationUnity	Hold your oath to heart, defend our country, and fight. 	Fight against the need for others to be in this position. 	Fight for peace and for honor. 	Fight with your ideas and courage. 	Fight with your words, not bullets.	Fight for our country, once again.
We should not become the enemy and we should not feel as tho our lives hold no meaning. 		It is this reason that I propose a final standing mission to all the brave men and women who have served.	A mission to regain our personal purpose and meaning in life.
We can not take our training to kill lightly, blood may make the green grass grow, but it is peace that keeps it green; It is liberty that planted the seeds. Let us not forget our oath to this country to defend the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic.
I want every #veteran to hear me on this.	Your life, and that of others, holds value to our country. Your services are needed in the times to come, not as an instrument of death, but a hard-willed instrument of peace.	We can not replace the willing sacrifice of a soldier.

@LPNational I'm curious as to the makeup of these newly liberated voters and what % were there because of the war on drugs that this entire party stands against.
@joecorea2 @CeciliaGlennon @LPNational Let me sum the core beliefs into a single sentance.	The belief in the most possible freedoms for the individual and governing interaction, when needed, for acts of aggression against those freedoms.
@2020fight Could, but it would be extremely pretty.
@nhgator13 @Acosta In context of the movie, this means something completely different than what the current comments are replying to. 	https://t.co/hsLNwqKx0T
@JosephPatrick53 @Acosta To what end would spreading this clearly false point benefit anyone? Missinformation is an issue already.	If you are going to fight the good fight, do it with honesty and unbiased observation, otherwise, you are a part of the problem.
@Acosta You were doing your job. You also have to consider that you're litterally in his house. Like it or not, that you need to respect that. You don't need to apologize for your right to speech and press, yet out of common decency, it would go a very long way.
@bri1989bri True, and pardon the vulgarity of this quote, but it is one that only works this way.		"I would rather the asshole I know well and is consistant in at least doing their job, than the unknown replacement that may be nice but is completely incompetent." -wise old co-worker
@bri1989bri I can't name them particularly but I've seen it before with Obama, Bush, and Clinton, however, we now look at the media far more closely and harshly than ever before. 		Specifically disincluding alex Jones from all this, as he was an outright a bully and fear monger.
@bri1989bri He was heated and disrespectful, for sure, but, I would give him another chance, just as I do with people I have to deal with at work.
@bri1989bri I will say tho, that's not unusual with correspondents. It is somewhat their job to dig, and if politicians would be honest without dodging this would happen less.	I would act on him in the way I would, because I would first make every attempt to answer honestly on topic.
@bri1989bri As obama would have said... "you're in my house, respect my rules"		Personally I would have escorted him off the premises myself after walking over to the mixer (or asking the ae) to mute his mic.
@AmericanBoxFan @libertarianism @LPNational @LawrenceBJones3 @reason @GOP Also, I have never been a Republican or a Democrat. I've always been centrist with no partisan to either side.
@AmericanBoxFan @libertarianism @LPNational @LawrenceBJones3 @reason @GOP I see that you are upset over the loss of who you wanted to win, and you want something to blame. 	I can assure you that many of those voters are third party, Republican, and Democrat. I can break down the numbers to help ease your misguided frustrations, if you want.
@DerRnB @fgastaldon @BernieSanders @seenorseems If they did it doesnt show me. https://t.co/VIYw0k9DSR
@AmericanBoxFan @libertarianism @LPNational @LawrenceBJones3 @reason @GOP This rhetoric must end. Libertarians bridge the gap and if we can get candidates in Congress, the deadlock will end and people of both parties will benefit. Not all libertarians are left or right, but, we are ALL for freedom.
@RepDannyDavis Sadly, lies seem to work better to get votes than honesty. I plan on full brutal honesty. I possibly won't be popular, but I will leave this persuit with my honor intact.
While every attempt is being made to interrupt and obstruct #Mueller and the #MuellerInvestigation, we forget that the president can not fire the people.	With all the brilliant minds in our great country, the people can find truth where the FBI is limited.
@LambMolinaro @CynthiaNixon @Ocasio2018 People too young buy into the pop solution exaggeration of it. People too old buy into the cold war exaggeration of it. 	I'm happy to buy into neither exaggeration at 35.
@AliciaAnnDewey1 23,098 vote difference only IF 99,052 people would have voted one side. The reality of it is they came from both sides of you look at the independants running, and quite a few would not have voted at all without a third option.
The only #wastedvote is one made on blind faith or one not made at all.
@Shaya10 @johncawks @morganisawizard Well... I... certainly hope so.
@WolfMaster4141 @realDonaldTrump The place to start is not the top, strategically, it would be senate, and scotus.
@realDonaldTrump Please, do this. 	PLEASE, DO THIS!	#justdoit 	If all corruption is gone from Washington and transparency is in place, I will gladly renounce my candidacy, as I would have no reason to even try. I could go back to normal life with confidence in "experienced' politicians.
@TwoDicksandMike @CPiecek6 @JimRohde3 @BernieSanders Also traffic around here makes a 5 mile trip 45 minutes some days.
@defrisselle @1979Sidm @LPNational @LarrySharpe @NYGovCuomo @NRA The media could blitz and overtake that action easily. 		...Unless his anti-corruption team found dirt that he could use to his advantage. https://t.co/rC1UX9bHYx
@Cpt_StarIV @bitchylaughter @pstarf @Grand_Messiah @BernieSanders Not everyone can. I've been in the position 1 or 2 times where I couldn't vote on election day due to work and other life responsibilities.
@TwoDicksandMike @CPiecek6 @JimRohde3 @BernieSanders I got the ride from/to work and as a manager I had to cover other voters taking the day off.
@realDonaldTrump For all whom are wondering why this would be a sucess in leau of democrats taking majority, it is because they failed at the majority to impeach. If enough democrats have their honor in place, they can still force a majority vote by cutting of their extra incomes.
@defrisselle @1979Sidm @LPNational @LarrySharpe @NYGovCuomo Yes. The money swings that way. But, for this to occur, there needs to be something for them in return. If there's anyone who can look into/find that info, that link will be severed.
@bwohlgemuth @LPNational @LarrySharpe It is called electoral fusion. This practice is not allowed in most states.
@TwoDicksandMike @CPiecek6 @JimRohde3 @BernieSanders It cost me $46 for the ride there and  back.
@DerRnB @fgastaldon @BernieSanders Our lifestyle still requires we work on holidays. This would be absolutely pointless.
@bitchylaughter @Cpt_StarIV @pstarf @Grand_Messiah @BernieSanders If we open the polls for the week, scheduling will not be difficult.
@TwoDicksandMike @CPiecek6 @JimRohde3 @BernieSanders Uber here was only half off when I used it.
@BernieSanders That would not really help people will still have to work on a holiday, like any other. Again I say, if all states open the polls for the week, more people will be able to vote, and the lines/wait times will be reduced.
@LarrySharpe 	There seems to be a large conflict of reporting on this race.
Our country has its differences, yet, we can still care for one another. Let's do this more often, without the prerequisites of tragedy.		Did Muslim Groups Raise More than $190,000 for Pittsburgh Synagogue Shooting Victims? https://t.co/lzkK1M3yVE via @snopes
@sarahmeaghang That is my core belief. 	No politician of any party has or ever will receive my vote if this is their practice.
@chazharris https://t.co/EL5hpwXPMX
@MallonAsa I miss my former home too, my friend.
#Alabama #Vote	The amendments/propositions contained in this cycle of voting are disturbing to say the least. What direction are we heading as a people? as a nation? I hope we get a grasp on what is right for government soon or we will face a country sans diversity and freedom.
#IVoted #vote	Today, I wrote in a lot of candidates.	I voted for a couple good #Republicans and #Democrats  that were on the ticket, and a couple people that didn't make it to ballot.		I voted no to halt abortion rights and the 10 commandments law.
@RepJoeKennedy So less than the crime committed is not one that is in line with abuse of our voting freedom or another's ability to do so, no citizen should be denied the right to vote.
@jkensign This bill provides for medical coverage to be denied in the event of a necessary abortions. It also opens legislative pathways to deny abortion all together. (The stated goal of the proposers)
#ElectionDay 	#Alabama 	Absolutely NO!!	This provides the denial of abortion in the case of the possible death of the mother as well! https://t.co/yFVrJPuZE6
@DPitar2 Its fever pitched to the point trump supporters were before 2016. Take a look at the replies I got when I tried to tell people to avoid blind party line voting.
@DPitar2 @RonKirbyFan Write-in is a good alternative. Homer Simpson has won elections this way, and it shows a stance in leau of options.
@SybilT2 @4everNeverTrump @MIdistrict33 A question that I regularly ask is if people know who they are voting for and what their policy is. It would probably not surprise you that a large portion do not know, but, they are sure that it's the best choice. This is the same for both Republican and Democrat voters.
@Lee1865 @4everNeverTrump Beto v Cruz....
@SybilT2 @4everNeverTrump @MIdistrict33 Also that is not inherintly true. If we all become informed on all sides. We eliminate binary voting. If rhetoric like that remains common, we only reinforce the issues that put us in this position.
@SybilT2 @4everNeverTrump @MIdistrict33 There are 3 other candidates and definately, molinaro is no alternative. This is why I say #CountryOverParty is important, research is important, informed consent is important. Your vote is your consent for that person to govern you.
@SybilT2 @4everNeverTrump @MIdistrict33 This rhetoric and party line voting assures people irrelevant to the issue a seat. Blue and where possible yellow are essential to have in congress asap for this reason, I wholly agree. The rest influence our lives and must be looked at separately of this.
@robsolonhamer @4everNeverTrump @MIdistrict33 Unfortunately, like some of the statements being made and the point I'm trying to make, research has not been done. I am not a New York resident. The only satisfaction I will have is a safe country for my family and friends.
@4everNeverTrump Thanks for bringing race into this. The black woman who took me in as an abandoned "white" child will have a good laugh at this.	It really says more about your character in this matter than mine, but, at least you're still free to say it, as misguided as it may be.
@MIdistrict33 @4everNeverTrump I believe the same. Historically systems with a gap as large as ours, both financially and ideologically, will either crash or undergo revolt. We all need to work together (as civilians and as leaders) to prevent it from reaching that point. Freedom is not easy or sans sacrifice.
@Liberty_Thunder Absolutely! There is a difference in intent. If a neighbor is eavesdropping that is illegal BECAUSE it is a private conversation that they are not a party to. If they overhear because its loud, that's a different story.
@CynthiaNixon @NYGovCuomo @LarrySharpe Look at your ballots before voting, you will see the wf candidates closely match dnc candidates. This is the same for other "parties". Please look before you leap and make sure these people represent you before voting. Your vote is your own voice, not the echo of another's.
@CynthiaNixon This party line is dnc funded and has @NYGovCuomo as a candidate. Do not party line vote! Pick the individual that best represents you.	@LarrySharpe, I would highly suggest people look him up before making any direct or indirect vote for Cuomo, a man that Nixon even says must go.
@27394days @ironsides23 @TheRealBK_ @cantguess01 @neiltyson Male, female, both, or no decernable sex. There is no in between with this and all sex related genetic conditions result in one of these 4 categories or death.	Even with a new legal definition, what does it matter? We are not to impose or enforce law based on sex.
@neiltyson If there is a single candidate that any real scientist would not like it would have to be @realDonaldTrump 	... or ...	Scott Wagner from Pennsylvania.
@Liberty_Thunder It may have run its course. He is financially conservative and has a limited budget. The campaign may have redirected the resources to places that need more coverage, he definately has twitter and youtube already.
@Liberty_Thunder I agree with this ONLY if it limits the research to public statements. I have just scrolled Facebook for only 6 minutes and have already found 4 people implying (or outright threatening) the use of unjustified deadly force against another.
@Liberty_Thunder That is a private group conversation. We should all consider our statements online for whether or not they are meant to be private or public before making them, just as we do offline.
@RyanNorrenberns @KanskeBra @onekade I know and frequently converse with quite a few officers where I work. They explain it as protecting people from each other is not easy, you go into a situation blindly with only the report made to guide you, unless that person has a record.
@onekade Meeting violence with violence does not solve a problem. It forces the looser to submit to the will of the winner rarely with compromise. There is a point to war, but, with peace in mind, you may win without firing a single bullet or throwing a punch.
@MIdistrict33 In my hands, this bill would receive an absolute veto, along with any bill that would otherwise attempt or violate the constitution.
@lpohutsky19 I'm a libertarian/centrist and regularly tell people that the party doesn't matter, it's the candidate and their willingness to listen to who they represent. You're a good example of this.
@4everNeverTrump @MIdistrict33 If you blindly vote blue, you have done yourself and the public no justice. 	NY for example. There are good DNC candidates on the ballot. There  is also one of the most corrupt governors in America representing DNC.
RT @dbourgois: Look up your ballot at https://t.co/9M4phtfCtB. Make yourself a “cheat sheet” &amp; vote all the way down the ballot. #VOTE
@dbourgois Adding: Please look up every name on this ballot before making any consideration over what circle you fill in or button you press.
@MIdistrict33 That being said. If the rights of all are to be equal, we must remain neutral on all religious matters unless those matters impose harm to the people. 	We have a rights issues, because we have unconstitutional law issue paired with hate issues and corruption.
@MIdistrict33 It only interferes with judgment of law. We have absolution in this fact with the first amendment, that congress shal make no law in behalf of, or against, religion. 	It should only be necessary if we fully allow religious (unconstitutional) laws and drop the first ammendment.
@Gibboanxious Red IS a component of orange...
@Bit3Me1 @Diva_Whoo @OpenTheDebates exactly.
@Gibboanxious Wasn't leeloo's orange? 	I second Jessica rabbits #1 spot. She is more iconic of a character than the movie itself.
@pabstimus Ooh, the canceled vote excuse. A lack of understanding simple math is no excuse! Canceled only works IF you vote.
@dhdt Dont party line vote. The people doing this are less likely to check, ask ted cruiz's campaign about this.
@RandilynIsIn @saguchip While it would be nice, personally, I can name at least 5 ways to hack that.
@saguchip The sad thing is, I've heard this excuse.
@SolomonKingCali The perception is rigged, the vote still counts.
@NoPants4OldMen Write-ins can and have won elections. Homer Simpson did, pedro can!
@TangledHotMess A colt45 and two zigzags is all you need. You can vote at the park then....
@jimmygIV Research, research, research.
@BuckyWilliamson The red dead redemption of my school years, back when government class was still a thing in middle school.
@McMannofthepeop Excuse accepted, keep practicing your constitutionally protected freedoms!
@Diva_Whoo They both were in it for the same reason.
@Diva_Whoo This is why I'm surprised gary Johnson only got 3% of the popular vote.
@monalisa4068 Or both of you can vote libertarian and try to get your freedom and neutrality back. ;-)
@DontThinkso555 In all honesty, if you know nothing about the candidates on your ticket, this is a reasonable excuse. Blind voting can be worse than no vote at all.
@karacod This really depends on the restraining order, and how crazy they are.
My local government wont let me vote.	(Increasingly true) 	This lame excuse, among many others, was brought to you by the act of voter suppression.		#LamestExcuseForNotVoting
"Government has too much control, so what sense does it make to vote."	#LamestExcuseForNotVoting
"I am running for president to help return the power to the people. Politicians claw their way to power so they can have control. I will claw from the top to return that power, honestly, and with integrity to the seat I respect more than who sits in it." -William Hurst 		#quote
@USATODAY The thing is, @LPNational can represent, and is comprised of, people from both major parties. Example; @GovGaryJohnson.	We can "take" Republican votes as-is, however, the VOTER decides who their's belong to, not a political group, so it can't be "taken" from any candidate.
@Liberty_Thunder Social media posts are litterally recorded public statements. If you stood on a street corner sharing your frustrations or making threats for all to hear, you do not intend on that statement to be private. Social media is no different.
@LynneeOrien @realDonaldTrump I.e. if a president were to say rumor has it that everyone will be tax exempt this year... I'm sure the entirety of the states would cheer.
@LynneeOrien @realDonaldTrump Context may be key in this.
@realDonaldTrump Donald, There are rehab centers that could help you with your substance abuse issues. Stop attacking people and seek the help you need.
@CivilityIsDead @LarrySharpe @TheLibRepublic It's called electoral fusion. It is illegal because a party can form many other parties that make a name appear multiple times on a ballot. Look up the parties that Cuomo has nominations for, two I've already tracked in the past are linked to dnc.
@RJtheCableGuy @LarrySharpe I thought this very same thing.
@LarrySharpe @LucyBrenton Now I see why many states banned electoral fusion... but, in a way, your's stands out. It was the first one my eyes came to because it was oddly placed.
@LucyBrenton your campaign is an uphill battle of what boils down to party recognition. You are the best of the group for your position, and one of the many reasons I decided to go libertarian instead of remaining independent. Stay bold.
I love people who can see fundamentals of things. https://t.co/XGeEEURqcZ

@AverageJoesSpo1 @DoubleCov_Pod @jbeanpoll @Yellowhammer247 If they were close to the players and good at what they do, there would be no reason to fire them, outside of some legal issues. If they were bad, then would it really affect the team in any discernable way?
@RonKirbyFan @realDonaldTrump Pretty much.
@RonKirbyFan @realDonaldTrump Not only fairness, but the basic principals of which we are founded. Any major party majority, currently, represents (absolutely) a very small portion and (relatively) 20-30% of people.
@RonKirbyFan @realDonaldTrump The party politics leads us to breaks in the system. Most notably gerrymandering. If a group has control, that group can set laws to further their influence.
@RonKirbyFan @realDonaldTrump Party based voting is now detrimental to democracy. However we need other parties to join in the mix so that it CAN be dismantled for the betterment of America. 	What party that is guaranteed a chance of power will willingly give that up? (Only Libertarian &amp; Tea parties afaik)
@RonKirbyFan @realDonaldTrump If you combine some you get a free green tea party
@RonKirbyFan @realDonaldTrump He is also the only candidate for Congress (so far) that I've heard of having a plan to meet with those he is to represent, just as he did while governor.
@RonKirbyFan @realDonaldTrump Gary was not due to twitter, he was just a republican first.
@RonKirbyFan @realDonaldTrump I've noticed a lot of GOP turned libertarian here on twitter. Gary Johnson is one of them that was governor and is running now.
@realDonaldTrump Using your office to influence votes? That is some shady stuff for a man trying to drain the swamp, unless you only want to drain it of opposition to yourself, then we call this a dictator in the making.
@Firefly1776 @DarelBoyer @LPNational @jennyann67 @Google Somalia is the only country I can think of without any form of government and I would much rather consent to laws and being taxed than live there. Taxes are a necessary evil.
@Firefly1776 @LPNational @jennyann67 Without interference... or influence. Basically, if you halt laws (interference) that prevent competition, this power diminishes. If they have no influence on government (lobbyists) this power diminishes.
@Firefly1776 @DarelBoyer @LPNational @jennyann67 @Google Willful concent can be implied by your choice to remain here. We are free to leave or stay. As for a choice in this matter, this is what voting is SUPPOSED to entail. The lack of knowledge and party voting leads us to require the libertarian party for a real choice.
@JanzforCongress Total control would be a 3/4 majority. Something that I hope never happens for either party with politics being this bad.
@TheGzusMan @HamillHimself People are becoming unified against trump, this is not dividing the country.
@HamillHimself I would prefer nobody sling bullets or rocks unless they have to. Rocks can kill too...	https://t.co/UHaJmfTnx8
#SaveAmerica 	For too long we have subverted our beliefs and morals as a country.its time we put common sense accountability back into government, with a dash of transparency.
@Simaca5 @alllibertynews @libertarianism I've not listened to this, however, I can say it is against liberty, with a track record to match. Our government is moving towards an authoritarian style. The combination of these elements is of concern, not general capitolism which is good.	https://t.co/04S1UcYwK3
@RonKirbyFan @MichaelAvenatti Before the internet parties had their place. Now, there is no true need. If we eliminate them all together, people will be forced to do actual research before they vote.
No longer shal I wonder. https://t.co/uj3rywNL6X
@RonKirbyFan @MichaelAvenatti There is an option at the polls to blindly vote for every candidate of a single party. That immediately hurts a single 3rd party candidate.
@RonKirbyFan @MichaelAvenatti I'm part of the third and viable party.    We just need to figure out how to combat practices in place that keep third parties out of the race.
@RonKirbyFan @MichaelAvenatti They are prepping. The long game is what they are looking for.
@MichaelAvenatti If they wont take an offensive on a position that is clearly wrong, a libertarian will fight tooth and nail.
@PattyArquette Not just blue, anything but red, for now. I hope no voter will focus on a single topic. Even if the democratic party is not what you want, there are other candidates that may suit you better while still promoting healthcare, give them your vote.
@IvoryShalimar @ThePerezHilton I like how you put this and, in all honesty, there is a sad truth to this statement.
@ThePerezHilton If people do not understand what is at stake here is greater than you think, read the ammendment and think outside of just a specific group. This includes all children, not just immigrants. 	This is a blatant step towards an authoritarian government, not a better America. https://t.co/q6WRHfAgN8
Is this abnormal? Let me answer my own question, no, it is not. What it is, however, is a pure dishonor to our country to continually lie to the people. https://t.co/xglRWZr074
@ScottPresler For what reason do you side with this?
#BirthrightCitizenship	We knew he didnt understand the office or care about the constitution before his election, how is it he won again?	@HillaryClinton was inaccurate as to her fact. It was close. "would try to" may be a better addition to make it fact. https://t.co/M0xDB78vFO
@mmpadellan My sentiments exactly.
#BirthrightCitizenship	An executive order is not law. It is a standing order in l'eau of law.		If a sitting president signs an order in subversion of the constitution, that order is nul and void of action.
@RepMarkMeadows Transparency is of utmost importance in many matters of government. This is the basis in our freedom of press outside of military operations.
@SenatorLeahy As I've said many times, votes do count! You can sway an election by many means, if you know who will vote in opposition to a party with sitting officials. The party takes presidence over country and this practice is detrimental to our democracy. #CountryOverParty
@SenSchumer Litterally no-one is not accurate, this is the frightening part. People will feed into this and preach it. His hardcore followers come with a borderline cult status, that ignore facts and will "drink the cool-aid" even to their own (and our country's) demise.
#GoogleWalkout	Understanding of what it is exactly, and handling the issue correctly with responsible judgment from managment should take presidence. 	Google workers arent usually close enough to recognize these issues like where I work. For this, they could hire liaisons.
This show, and waste of our resources needs to stop. 	Our country has more important tasks that need attention. Our core of engineers could easily be working on physically "making America better again" with the assistance of all these troops.
#ThursdayThoughts	We don't need military at the Mexico border, it's pointless show for voters. 	A plane to Canada is far easier for many and the border is less hostile.	The entire ordeal is a waste of our resources and time, that would be better suited elsewhere.
#QuestionOfTheDay 	Why do you think you would be a good president?		I'm driven to prove myself. For me, its not about money, it's about paving a path for a better America, not for myself, but my family, friends, and fellow citizens.	Everything I do will reflect this goal.
@realDonaldTrump The president should be working on his portion of the country's responsibilities (towards peace) instead of mocking others and playing golf.
@whopbell2 @realDonaldTrump They, at that point have dual citizenship, as with any child born in our country. Whether or not they are  from foreign parents. 		If we are so hard up that we can't openly accept immigrants into our country, that says more about our country than anything else.
@maddow It is not uncommon for voter suppression to help win elections. After the whole @SenWarren ordeal,   this makes sense in our current political climate.
@UnitersCentrist @Krokton1 This is not the method I'm referring to. It's not electoral fusion in the traditional sense, however, it is like that. Single party nomination, multiple party endorsements. While multiple party nominations arent legal in all states, endorsments are.
@UnitersCentrist @Krokton1 As a thought, third parties may be minorities in our political situation and with a third party being immensely necessary in politics at the moment, wouldn't it be wise to coalesce our differences into a single and attainable victory effort for the sake of our country and peace?
@UnitersCentrist @Krokton1 Minority In almost all parties.
@WillConk1 @WyattEarpLA That is litterally the intent of my campaign slogan and core belief.		E pluribus unum possimus 	Of many, we can be one
@BTCBanzai @WyattEarpLA It is not just the left, both sides are working the extremes of their ideology. We are busy picking two sides of the same coin. Neither side is pushing for our freedom, just slowly chipping away a path towards an authoritarian version of democracy.
@WillConk1 @WyattEarpLA The issue is hatred not firearms. Sadly the issue is in the hands of both parties who promote further hatred of each other to win elections, leaving the people to fight each other with a skewed view of what leadership and reality is.
@KrisBrbr93 @WyattEarpLA A great reason to vote libertarian!
@LarrySharpe There is a master plan, as you have stated. Your placement or victory will be a tour de force for transparency in government and elections.
@keithboykin The weapon used is of no consequence in this. When will we learn, that no matter the means, the result is the same. There is no cure to be had in treating symptoms of a disease, we must treat the disease itself. We must find a way to halt the  acceptable hatred that causes this.
In schools we see hatred in #bullying. Those acting on the child to provoke them to commit the attrocities we see in a public/private suicide.		Never mind banning guns, let's ban hate. Let us, as a country, put an end to this, through both law and a common respect of each other.
The #shooting today is not about gun laws, it is not about politics, it is not about mental illness. At the root of all these acts are hatred. THIS person is likely connected to racist groups as is usually the case...

#FalseFlags	We see these acts all to often from both sides. 	To hide your true nature and intent has become common for nearly all whom seek office. 	We need transparent leadership that is dedicated to Americans, not their pocket like a pirate. 		My ONLY flag is old glory.
@RealJamesWoods Did they really need to be for a point to be made? Whether it was sent by a trump supporter out of anger or the dnc for furthered support in upcoming elections. The stark realization in this is we are torn, and hatred separates us, not of the people, but of the politics between.
@BernieSanders This is one of the things I will agree with you on. The upper class is taking over law itself. They may keep their wealth, but only the wealth they have earned, fairly, not the wealth that they are changing the rules to attain and keep.
@LPNational Deadpool... the most liberated super hero ever.
@LPNational I'm directly talking to people for my own campaign, it is overly common that people have no clue how government works, but they do vote.  What seems to be the most common case, so far, is that independant voters are far more knowledgeable of government than party fixed voters.

@UkiVlad @ispreadliberty @Memberberryvine @AFPhq That sucks, I definately dont see disability as a luxury. (Outside of those that abuse it) 	And it is great to hunt/track this data. It is not easy getting exact figures (I've looked)
@UkiVlad @ispreadliberty @Memberberryvine @AFPhq In pure volume, Brazil.	In suicide, USA.	In murder we are only 31st by %.	In total deaths we are 1st.	In death per 100k people we are 12th.	In death by 007 we are last.	If anyone wants to play up (or down) gun violence, you can cherry pick any of those stats to meet a need.
@UkiVlad @ispreadliberty @Memberberryvine @AFPhq I needed that laugh.
@UkiVlad @ispreadliberty @Memberberryvine @AFPhq Unfortunately if he doesnt step down or is made to leave office, he will. Worse to consider than him would be the VP taking the position, we are not in a good spot at the moment.

@ispreadliberty @UkiVlad @Memberberryvine @AFPhq Because, the healthcare affects life and liberty that is to be protected by government action.	There is no fair market value for your life that does not interfere on your liberty.
@ispreadliberty @UkiVlad @Memberberryvine @AFPhq They cant be skewed by this as we rank 88th in violence and 33% of countries beat us in auto deaths.	The USA does however lead the developed world in medical related mistakes that cause death, which if noted as a true cause of death would be the third leading cause of death.
@UkiVlad @ispreadliberty @Memberberryvine @AFPhq It is expensive in direct result of insurance and pharmaceutical companies. A doctor will charge frivolously on insurance to get more money. They also get money for prescriptions filled. I've seen this on nearly every insured visit I've had after looking at the billing.
@ispreadliberty @UkiVlad @AFPhq This is not an apples to apples comparison. Without a pacemaker and a doctor, you could die. Without a car or a mechanic you can live perfectly fine. The very idea of freedom hinges on being alive to enjoy it, otherwise, what use would you have for freedom in a coffin?
@chuckwoolery I'm on board of this includes Republicans as well. Our current situation is bilaterally created by these opposing and ever more polarized views. We need more choices. We need leadership that will listen to the people, and not their pockets. We need true representation!
@LPNational @lucy4senate @newsmax The polls can also be used to discourage third party votes. We live in a society where the popular choice of others (or the idea of) can persuade people who have not researched to follow based on the idea that others have done this as well. (False science research for example)
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump "the people", the very words in the document we abide by as a country, by definition, asserts that there is no consideration to whom "the people" are, based on anything less that they are people with inalienable freedoms. This word has not changed since at least 1787.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump &lt;- Patriot to the core. I am not understanding this hard push for the  nationalist ideas of isolation. How have we become so adept to isolating minorities and foreigners that we effortlessly overlook common laws and actions that attribute to this issue?

@2020fight Cable prices are high depending on channels for the charge to the company. Internet is only charged on backbone useage. Which is mitigated by local streaming servers.

#QuestionOfTheDay 	What is a the libertarian party? 		Ultimately, it's a self correcting party of free thinkers, motivated towards your personal freedoms, and is against any authoritarian practice.	It shares common ideas with GOP and DNC (where those ideas dont hinder freedom).
@AnnelisTrevino @s_gilley @lav_sunrise @Jacksays4 @ProudResister To an extreme, I agree, but generally nationalistic ideas can help along with globalistic ideas. It all depends on what would be best overall for the country, not a firm yes or no based on an extremist view of either side.
@s_gilley @lav_sunrise @Jacksays4 @ProudResister If done the right a semi-globalist approach could produce more jobs locally and a much higher national income. If we isolate ourselves too far we lose proffit from the global market on cost. (Realistically we shouldn't even have our hands in the pot, federally, anyways)
@NYGovCuomo, The fact that you wouldn't debate @LarrySharpe shows weakness. It shows that you are so unsure of your victory that you would rather shut out opposition than confront and defeat it. This is not the leadership Americans need, it's just what we have got used to.

@jneproductions @SenKamalaHarris Here you have a person in senate that can vote on these things, why would you want to loose this? Pick someone that would complement these goals for President. Congress is immensely powerful if the right people are seated.
@ucf_seber If we had ranked voting, the vanilla candidate would win most of the time, and polar opposites would fade out of political control.

@RonKirbyFan Youtube is not the end all, tyt are mostly honest in their research, I wish they would not try to push a view, but overall I have yet to research and find false claim they have made on facts.
@RonKirbyFan Basically it looks like a duck walks like a duck quacks like a duck, and its dressed like a dog. Unless you catch it and take the costume off the duck, you could argue that it's a duck. Never mind how someone got a duck into a dog costume. Haha
@RonKirbyFan The only public evidence is timeline, his public statement that called for its commencement, the meetings in trump tower, and many ties to Russian oligarchs. All evidence is inferred at this point, but there are too many coincidences for it not to be truth.
@RonKirbyFan I can also 99% assuredly say that this would not be a hack on the trump campaign either.
@RonKirbyFan https://t.co/4vGWiOtLYK		Tyt branded partisan views aside, it is viable evidence. (It is common to use end point communication and packet size to infer the communication purpose)
@StephenKing I must ask, how does it feel when real life has more horror than your entire collection of renowned books in the genre?
@TPCarney I am one for one, and see polygamy as a huge waste of time. Who am I to put laws in place to tell someone not to waste theirs? It's really a matter of personal preference, not law.

@RealFedParty @sumdumgirl2 Ty, I realized that I missed it as the original post, I'm viewing from @sumdumgirl2's message.
@RealFedParty @sumdumgirl2 It may help to get a link to that Manhattan institute idea so I can understand what exactly you're referencing. 		Side note: I like this idea of healthy conversation and exchange between party lines (even generally opposing ones). Too bad this is mostly isolated to third parties.
@RealFedParty @sumdumgirl2 Many specifics add up, like constantly buying sodas and wondering where the entire paycheck went to. Like the savings from halting penny production it may be small in scale, but it adds to the total (awkwardly like saving them to make a dollar)
@RealFedParty @sumdumgirl2 If I take an average of what I've already seen from only military waste, that would be significant savings.
@RealFedParty @sumdumgirl2 Yes, I am not oblivious that more than this is needed, but, for this conversation I am sticking to an area that I have personal insight into.
@RealFedParty @sumdumgirl2 Investigation and implementation would take the willingness of a president to call for a full audit of all institutions independantly and responsibly. Something I dont see happening with the current administration.
@RealFedParty @sumdumgirl2 I understand, tho, how can one plan specifics without tangible figures? That is the first step, assess the actual figures. Second step is to implement those figures based on a general idea dependant on the extent of those figures.

@2020fight @realDonaldTrump Democrats still have enough seats to completely halt almost any and all legislature until elections and swear-ins.
@RealFedParty @sumdumgirl2 There is no solid way to assess this currently. That is the first plan, to make a solid assessment of expenses, not relying on general figures. There are many ways for this information to be attained, some of which will have to be close to the chest.
@RealFedParty @sumdumgirl2 Take the savings and set an overage budget to be used or saved per area based on half of this total for the initial budget and set all the remaining funds to needs and debt repayment.
@RealFedParty @sumdumgirl2 Military spending i.e.includes intentional waste to keep funding to their section. My plan would be to assemble a committee to investigate use or loose funding in detail from all departments to reduce spending, the exact number will be totaled and cut from the initial budget.
@SoquelCreek @ThomasSowell In my view it is full. 50% air and 50% water.

@taylom22 @2VNews @LarrySharpe It would be locally in Alabama.
@taylom22 @2VNews @LarrySharpe My fear in the lp nomination process is my ideas that may not match party lines to the T. 	I am hoping this is not the case, but, I will never compromise my ideas of what's right or wrong without evidence and have never reduced myself to lies to win anyone over.
@taylom22 @2VNews @LarrySharpe Ty. I'm actually going this week for beer and chat at the local vfw with a supporter to talk current candidates for alabama. (not myself) So, I'm not past hanging out with people rather than just talking to a group and disappearing.
@wcbs880 You get your debate, without Cuomo  and without a campaign violation for Molinaro
@wcbs880 As was previously stated, ratings would be high across the United states. New Yorkers in other states and many people like myself would watch this even if it is just Molinaro vs Sharpe.
@Quatelmon @wcbs880 @NYGovCuomo NYT has done an article on this. I think he is opting this method to throw the race instead of campaigning and directly losing to better his chances at a presidential campaign, thinking he will be a shoe in post trump as a Democrat if he remains quiet against sound opposition now
@EmilyEggbert @LuckDragon69 @yashar He is right, where I come from in the dmv area deer are an issue with a lack of predators aside from humans and multiply fast. I killed many to eat over the years. It's an abundant and renewable food source for some. This can not be compared to that.
@JBadari @yashar It is not.
@Conor1971 @gordonsta @yashar Squirrels, cats, (some) undomesticated dogs, killer whales, dolphins... I can go on with this... humans should be above this, as we have the ability to reason far more than any of these other species. We should kill to eat, not murder to mount a head.
@CarlForrest Or for when you swat at bees...
#QuestionOfTheDay 	Why do you follow and advertise Sharpe?		His grassroots campaign will have a much larger impact to American politics in a whole of he succeeds. It will be a landmark victory for all independant and third party candidates with all the hurdles in that race.
@LarrySharpe 	Idea factory is at work. Publically record a visit a location and poll people on a busy street without your sharpe shirt.	1. Do you know the candidates for your governor? 	2 Would you be willing to share who you want to vote for? If so, who?	3 how did you decide?
@beinlibertarian I've had a general thought about the voters that are voting on blind faith of a party. I have said before that voters should have a basic test for registration in what the candidates they are voting for are responsible for. However, free classes in this would likely be better.
@carolunsicker @beinlibertarian This would assure a higher satisfaction if there are more than 2 candidates
@taylom22 @2VNews @LarrySharpe Bet, I will be up there next year at some point. I AM running for president after all.
@taylom22 @2VNews @LarrySharpe You sir owe me a coffee. You made me spit and spill mine out of laughter. Awesome
@TropicalSeverus @BernieSanders @PadmaLakshmi The only other issue here would be number of locations and sometimes the distance to "your" voting area.
@TropicalSeverus @BernieSanders @PadmaLakshmi That is awesome.
#quotes 	"Think not of a singular blocked path that gets you to where you want to go, but of one with many routes and you will get there no matter how many obstacles impede your journey" - me
@2VNews @taylom22 @LarrySharpe If you have not been fully reading my posts, you are missing out on the freedom of choice in all ideas. Think not of a singular blocked path to the destination, but of a road with many routes to get there.
@2VNews @taylom22 @LarrySharpe You want pure anarchy in your suggestions, that, again, is an extremist view that I will not lend any more time to converse against, as there is no compromise in extremes only a practice in futility.
@2VNews @taylom22 @LarrySharpe Correction, not what most are talking about.
@2VNews @taylom22 @LarrySharpe With a full federal health/school system in place that does not eliminate free market alternatives. It adds a choice. Eliminating the free market is not what anyone is suggesting when talking about universal healthcare or public education.
@2VNews @taylom22 @LarrySharpe Unless many people do not opt in. Then the cost would be minimal to the government to carry out the responsibility by other means.
@2VNews @taylom22 @LarrySharpe No on financial assistance and social security can ride out it's existance. In place for a bond based retirement plan, one that you opt into, it helps the federal government via buy in surplus. With an increasing or stable population the funding would be assured and stable.
@2VNews @taylom22 @LarrySharpe It is a VERY bad practice and industry that is riddled with abuses that are easily searched on Google. 	Look, blind one sided extremist views are in all parties, even libertarian. If we are to become a better country we need to learn compromise and validity in other's views.
@2VNews @taylom22 @LarrySharpe Population has eliminated the ability for most to self sustain food without money, it is semi required as an intrapersonal relation. So on that, a government hand in the process is on the very basic level of protecting life of citizens. (Abuses in it aside)
@TropicalSeverus @BernieSanders @PadmaLakshmi If not every site is up all week it would get immensely confusing. The basic idea would be simple access.
@The_Link7 @BernieSanders That is part of my general goals for reform in my campaign!
@TropicalSeverus @BernieSanders @PadmaLakshmi The issue with that here would be funding (specifically, convincing the right people of it). However the turnout would definately be far better overall.
@BernieSanders If election day is split into two days, the legal requirement for all employers could be that all employees must have one of these two days off to vote, allowing businesses to function easily while reducing the wait time for voters.
@LarrySharpe 1. Year round schools 	2. Singular teacher per field per class progression. 	3. Sampling tests to gauge general memory, ability, and reasoning.	4. Ability to transfer school systems nationwide and be correctly placed.	5. Fluid class progress, not a forced pass/fail per grade.
@2VNews @taylom22 @LarrySharpe A fully privatized school system is delimiting to the freedom of choice to be educated. I am all for furthered personal freedom first and foremost and a good/free alternative to privatized school provides MORE freedom for all citizens.
@taylom22 @2VNews @LarrySharpe This will go on forever. The personal want for it is not wrong, however government is a necessity in a large population and we all must use our own ability to reason, so that we can avoid authoritarian control and maximize freedom without losing peace and issue resolution.
@taylom22 @2VNews @LarrySharpe That is partially incorrect. (Some) do better than average as well as (some) public schools do well too. I went to 7 different high schools in multiple states. Some were far more advanced than others, and this is still holds true today.
@2VNews @taylom22 @LarrySharpe And their cost is not prohibitive, how?
@2VNews @taylom22 @LarrySharpe That is simply not true, and we have many examples of this. They can charge higher prices to make it unappealing to lower income people. School already has a segregation issue. This would lead to furtherance of the issue.
@CarlaCoonAuthor @LarrySharpe A school should not be measured based on the sucess in the school, however the sucess of its students after the fact.
@taylom22 @2VNews @LarrySharpe Privatized would lead to what we see in the college system. I would not like to see school being out of reach for low income people.
@TomMcMurray11 @JNP63 @FoxNews @SteveScalise I do, and "legal" attacks against minorities occur often, based on Republican ideological laws.
@FoxNews @SteveScalise Very true, also @GOP should not condone descrimination. They are moving towards authoritarian style government very fast. The party is leading the conservative people in this nation towards fear, in trade for votes.
There are #Libertarian leaning people on both sides of the spectrum. Libertarian is about liberty and freedom, It is the opposite of authoritarian government not R&amp;D, however R&amp;D allow for authoritarian control in their ideology. https://t.co/7dIUTMCMjU
@Dennis_35901 And you are (likely as you have always been) conservative with a taste for freedom in your own home, with maybe a little badass in public streak and you can capitalize on what is available to you. You could go moderate GOP or conservative libertarian and be perfectly represented.
@Dennis_35901 You know from personal experience, my recent lifestyle. I'm bipartisan as hell with a "you're free to believe what you want unless it effects me" attitude, as it has been since I can remember. People dont change much, politicians change on the fly for votes, yet are the same.
@GovGaryJohnson may be on the wilder and more liberated side, but, is the only person running for #Senate in #newmexico that will willingly represent the people first, with an open door policy to hear their voice directly.
#QuestionOfTheDay 	How would you fix the budget?		I would make an attempt to recess and limit future spending based on the previous year's revenue. I would work on efficiency of the money, so that we can responsibly eliminate income taxes and get back on track.
@Dennis_35901 Personally I think the GOP should have voted no and waited for an acceptable nominee. They want a nominee that will rule based on GOP ideology. I'm delving deep into politics and I'm more disappointed every day with what I'm finding from ALL parties. It's a horror show.
@Dennis_35901 Also, nobody thinks about the possible repercussions to her from going public. She wished to remain annonymous. And realistically, she could have, and nothing would have changed.
@Dennis_35901 There were more. But, people are using it to steal money, there is only one legal fund to go to her. Just like if you go to my GoFundMe it is the only one legally representative by my campaign.
@LarrySharpe @NYGovCuomo You dont need to stoop to general political standards. We had quite a few new Yorkers down here for the Talladega race and upon seeing my libertarian pin, they started talking, there was even argument over you and Cuomo and Cuomo fans were unaware of you&amp;your ideas til then.
@3YearLetterman @BarackObama You need a posting claiming fictional content. Some politicians do too, i understand, but, this is a very untasteful joke.

The thing I've noticed most is sympathy for refugees from other countries. A quote from someone yesterday says is all "Its hard enough on me evacuating to a different state, I can only immagine how much more difficult this would be for a foreigner"
Spending this past week or two chatting with the refugees from Florida after Mike, we really need to think about temporary living for emergencies. The hotels here have been charging more than normal for sub par service. People are also ditching family pets per hotel no-pet policy

If you want to poke fun at @SenWarren for her heritage or pride in it, no matter how remote, I take no shame in calling you a complete and utter asshole.
@sjredmond Again I say, that one statement, based on the decades of issues, may entice ~4.8 million voters to register and vote.... for other candidates.
@JAClark412 @LarrySharpe Vista print is a viable alternative. It may not contribute to the campaign monetarily but it will contribute to visibility as fast as possible (a different means to the same goal) and you can still contribute the remainder.

@pandaluver365 @kenolin1 Third parties if they are seated or attain high enough votes, immediately force the main two parties to run as the third did, based on policy not who is less evil as it has become. Look at the most recent indiana senate debate as a blatant example of this.

@goodbye56789 @kenolin1 @TeresaFeldman2 Always talk full spectrum. This creates more of an incentive to look for themselves and not feel forced. Non voters have a reason for it and a singlular mindset is a red flag. "Vote for me or not, as long as you vote, I will know your voice is being heard."
@Cruellaisdevine @DebtTrut @kenolin1 @jhburgess98 By resistance, do you mean soely democrat votes vs Republican (per your name) or resistance to fix our nation? Intolerance is only partially fought by democrats (in practice), it is completely unacceptable by any libertarian, myself included.
@Mark_Niehaus @kenolin1 @WhitfordBradley This election is "very important" for that very reason. A majority can redraw those lines based on the votes this go around. It's a detestable practice by both parties.
@kenolin1 Your voice in voting is essential to show those that support these ideas that you will not take it, and you will not support those that purvey that message.
@LilBit500 @OpenTheDebates @GovGaryJohnson @TravisIrvineUSA It is also why we need to be more sharp on our research into our candidates many will be shunted from media completely and why grassroots campaigns are all that much more important now.

@GovGaryJohnson Missions? I dont personally take the defence of this country lightly, as such, I would like to know that our overall defense is first and foremost, not a state's pocketbook from federal defence funds. Clarity on this would be appreciated, as I do not share a politician mindset.
@GovGaryJohnson Overall I noticed a pandering by all three looking for federal military funds, I noticed all three bickering. But only a single candidate said they will LISTEN to the people he is looking to REPRESENT. Gary, you are the only real candidate on that stage worth that seat.

@joerogan Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. (Semi scifi)
@AshleyFarago @joerogan The TV show, not the movie.
@buccaneermason @joerogan I forgot about this movie, I need to get a copy to keep.
@joerogan Human centipede: I wanted to run away from it as fast as I could. So it may help.
@jopan1 @berthyman @libertarianism D = democrat or democratic? There is a huge difference between the two.
@mad_cow_chris @LPNational I cant help but to laugh. That's true of almost every politician I've seen lately. Like Scott Wagner a senator who is talking about body heat and earth moving closer to the sun causing climate change.
@mad_cow_chris @LPNational As for VP, I do not get that pick, however I do have my 5 picks to watch just in case.
@mad_cow_chris @LPNational Be forewarned that many interviews will try to force that perspective as a stereotype. My friend has let me know how they did this on air while she worked for a news show.
@mad_cow_chris @LPNational I laughed reading this. It is not the first time I've heard this. And if you want to offer thoughts on the site, I am willing to hear critiques. I am going to publish other sections soon, as I'm writing it on my own between work, family, and meeting people.
@Asgardian101 @NewParisite @wikileaks I do not see it, I would be happily mistaken. Time wise the changeover cant possibly happen in 2 years as there would have to be many amended laws, facility changeovers, seasonal crops that arent yet legal, and people willing to do this to their company.
@RonKirbyFan I concur. The alternative is breaking out all reserves to deadline an ev and hemp changeover. One which may bring our two countries very close.
@mad_cow_chris @LPNational You will start to see more of me here soon. I'm not pushing myself hard until after mid terms and people settle from the chaos that is right now. I will be doing this as grassroots style so it will take time, patience, and a lot of volunteers. (I have some in 7 states already)
@SultanHarthii @wikileaks But, what I'm getting at is, the complete loss of global demand (outside of russia) will do more than sting. It will be economically crippling to an area with few other options. Russia will take the region once the price goes up for them and then where is help?
@SultanHarthii @wikileaks I dont have a vehicle, as I can feasibly walk to where I need to go. 	I do understand your statement, and that after reserves run dry and we tap into our untapped resources. We would not run out by the time we can suffer through the renewable swatch. It will sting.
@jopan1 @berthyman @libertarianism We have the ability to do that with our government, if, and only if, the majority stands up and takes presidence of honesty and liberty over empty promises and control.
@RonKirbyFan Economically the transition to ev  would be harder under that price increase than just taking an entire country by force overnight or in &lt;30 days, as there would be a net gain from this, with applause from the world for cheap gas (This is a sad and very plausible option for some)
@mad_cow_chris @LPNational I can assure you of one thing, I am not a joke. Nor do I plan on presenting myself as such.
@mad_cow_chris @LPNational :/ I've seen what you are talking about. One candidate is literally taking it as a joke. However, this is freedom in practice. The other parties cherry pick. This one gives all the chance to present themselves. It looks bad, and I originally thought so too, til I understood it.
@bandpractice2 @jdonevan178 @MJSodone @LPNational There are three notable libertarian candidates right now up for election that are astronomically better than the democrats they hope to take the place of. To the point that democrats want them in their party.
@bandpractice2 @jdonevan178 @MJSodone @LPNational That would be the misconception that you are being fed. Yes, at the moment some democrats should win to even the house, but you have an entire blue wave what changes? The sheer notion of a viable, and seated, third party will disrupt corrupt practices instantly.
@SultanHarthii @wikileaks Absolutely, but, if it's the main economic export that will be used in that reply, the entire world is only holding on to that export for its price over better alternatives. If price goes up, that ends the resources viability in entirety.
@NewParisite @wikileaks We really need to make a push for independance of foreign oil in trade for renewable. Threats like this would then be laughable instead of viable.
@wikileaks I would say to him "Bring it on, as long as you realize that holding a (currently) necessary economic resource over the worlds head will make the world not only strike back, but realize that dependance on it is unnecessary and will only assure your own economic downfall."
@elizabethforma @maura_healey I am still seeing debt to itt tech even after getting the federal loan forgiveness letter. Still getting debt calls. I only took 3 classes. They kept all the remaining grant funds and I now owe for the whole thing.
@RonKirbyFan I don't foresee it happening without a major fight, but I would be happy to be wrong in this.
@LarrySharpe I'm likely going to forever reference this speech as an appropriate use of "mudslinging". This was not a smear, it was a call to arms. https://t.co/CMVF4lvnTg
You want me to be mad over #socialism #capitalism #Government #lgbtq #authority #anarchy #abortion #ProLife, yet all these things have their place in our world. Our differences are not what separates us, but, a common act of freedom that binds us all. 	#OfManyWeCanBeOne
@berthyman @jopan1 @libertarianism Without that law/police power, the rich would likely impose themselves on others. An absolute minimum government should provide protection of an individual's rights from any person or group infringing on those rights.
@jopan1 @berthyman @libertarianism Hence the need for leaders that promote transparency and honesty.
@libertarianism More or less, yes. It majorly depends on reason and who benefits/contributes. Most churches and n4p's practice basic socialism. (Contribution redistributed). One can argue willfulness over requirement, and to that I would reply, "required can be made to appear willfull".
@libertarianis13 No, on basics yes, but once it gets into specifics it open ends a pathway for use in the objective infringement of other's rights. I've already seen nap cited this way a few times here on twitter (which is against it's own principal)
@libertarianism There is no moral case in libertarian philosophy (and many more). Do no harm to others. The industry vs the environment effects all people, worldwide, in a harmful way. There are 100% viable replacements now, so any push to keep it going is soely capitalistic at this point.
@JimmySpelts @67Coronet @libertarianism @alllibertynews Public domain. They are in public, this means you are not intending on privacy, as anyone can see them or what they are doing. If this wasn't the case, we could not talk on the cellphone in public as it would likely count as eavesdropping on a private conversation.
@libertarianism As for the privacy involved, a police officer patrols public domain, on a call, that extends to the location of the call, unless in pursuit. Even then they are still bound to laws of private property, however I do think that can reasonably be looked over in pursuit.
@libertarianism Astoundingly the answer is yes for body cams. Turning them off is an absolute no. This is a method for accountability. I do believe it was baltimore, maryland that did a trial of the body cam, and after stopping the trial. Both cops and public requested to keep them.
@LarrySharpe There goes that New York spitfire! In a safely non foul way.
@NYNOW_PBS @LarrySharpe Here is the thing, Cuomo has a 30 million dollar purse, let him not care about winning this race. He is earning funds for a presidential run not gubernatorial. He will eventually have to be on stage debating a libertarian. I hope it is myself, but, any party nominee will work.
@AngelaR45117306 @NYNOW_PBS @LarrySharpe Idea still stands... two people show... not the poll leader...
@kevin_nudist @LPNational We can eliminate 100million right off the bat by halting penny and nickel production. We keep what we have in circulation until we fully phase out of their useage.
@kevin_nudist @LPNational It is not impossible to repay all of our debts in 10 years. However we need ~10 years of the right kind of president and house reps to responsibly fulfill that and laws in place to set a cap based on soely previous year's revenue. Essentially only spending what is in the bank.
@LPNational An audit would be a necessary first step for ANY institution to prove an issue beyond a shadow of doubt. Not an audit by that institution, but a non partisan or affiliated trust formed to perform it.
@ReverendSlim @HillaryClinton He was asking if his previous request had been fulfilled. Not much of a difference, it was still admission on live tv.
@HillaryClinton He said, "Russia, if you're listening, I hope you are able to find the 30000 emails." That is not a general statement. That was directed. That also implied from speech that it was a previous request that he was asking about.
@hawley4209 @Strong4Liberty @FlintyMaguire @SpeakerRyan This reduces payments via both employers and individuals. The ultimate loss would be the entire insurance system, the ultimate gain would be a boost to the economy in entirety. Healthcare providers also make more money guaranteed while charging less.
@hawley4209 @Strong4Liberty @FlintyMaguire @SpeakerRyan In very short, adding $50 from most adults, an equivalent employer match (both yearly), and current state/federal spending added is around 2.4 trillion. Current costs are 3.4 trillion. Donation programs currently make up the difference.
@photoartist9 @valrfederoff @Burtpatch @BernieSanders It is a matter of perspective and can not be easily noticed from the outside as there is no grounds for understanding. There are people who dont try, absolutely, yet there are those that do with constant forced failure. Being poor costs more overall.
@hawley4209 @Strong4Liberty @FlintyMaguire @SpeakerRyan Realistically I was going to start a crowdsource fund along side a nonproffit to lay the groundwork privately with the idea of a federal handoff later but federal/state/local laws are heavily restrictive on this.
@hawley4209 @Strong4Liberty @FlintyMaguire @SpeakerRyan I may do that on my website and link it on here. It's nowhere near possible on twitter.
#NationalComingOutDay	This may come as a surprise, but I'm completely straight. I also give no second thought to what anyone else is. I will turn you down if you're a guy, but, it's not offensive to ask, it's polite, and sometimes flattering.
#NationalComingOutDay	Who you are or who you want to be is your personal freedom. The fact that this day exists is evidence that we regularly discourage freedom and hold socially accepted intolerance for another's personal choices. America, we can be better than this.

@p3Acewalker_Paz @LPNational A raise would force efficiency requirements. It is common in many industries now and will increase with min wage. I used to be a supporter of min wage until I personally looked into all of it.
@EliPark700 @Strong4Liberty @FlintyMaguire @SpeakerRyan This is true, the cost is also compounded by attempts to collect.
@hawley4209 @Strong4Liberty @FlintyMaguire @SpeakerRyan I've done the numbers for my idea of universal healthcare. It will cost $50 per adult that is not disabled for around 6 years until it becomes self sustaining.
@Strong4Liberty @FlintyMaguire @SpeakerRyan Healthcare is a necessity for all. One way or another, the inability of one to pay rolls into the cost of someone who can. Non socialistic medicine actually costs more to operate in this way.
@Strong4Liberty @FlintyMaguire @SpeakerRyan A slightly higher tax will cost you less overall than any health insurance program that exists. You can choose no insurance, and that will cost you even more eventually.
@SpeakerRyan @RepBillFlores I cannot explain in limited characters how the benefits overwhelmingly outweigh the drawback, or how the funding and overall lowered cost would be self sustaining and beneficial to all. I can only say we can do this at yearly cost of $50/yr per person to start then freely after.
@photoartist9 @valrfederoff @Burtpatch @BernieSanders Yes. Simple would be absolutely true if there were not inherint issue in this approach.  If you are setup for sucess this is an option. If not, it is a poverty loop that takes help or luck to get out of, no matter the effort.
@photoartist9 @valrfederoff @Burtpatch @BernieSanders It is not that simple anymore, but it is right, and should be that easy.
@Burtpatch @BernieSanders This is not entirely true. The middle class having the majority of responsibility to the socialistic practice while the upper class holds little responsibility to it, yet collects the most from its efforts via the lower class. This leads to your view. (Sans system abusers)
@DanneKindh @Hereticalmist @MortemFelix @Sn1peratLARGE @Damn_Taffer @BernieSanders That is a hefty balancing act of necessity. I willfully signed up to defend the country. I was not forced to sacrifice myself, it was my choice. I was paid by the tax dollars of the people, so it is socialistic, but an endeavor that is not without just cause.
@Sn1peratLARGE @Damn_Taffer @BernieSanders Aspects of it work, as well as aspects of capitalism, authoritarianism, and libertarianism. No single direction works for the majority and too far in any direction can fail any larger community. It is a blend of these aspects that work.
@BernieSanders Concerning this message, it is a political standpoint in an attempt to harvest the black community's vote. This is ultimately harmful to equality in our great nation, paving a road for hatred as a point of blame.
@LarrySharpe I know it may not be libertarian philosophy to have medicine as a socialistically funded endeavor for all, but, it is one of the few things that would make sense constitutionally as a federal level/funded institution and not for proffit. (Sans elective procedures)
@LarrySharpe The issue with health services is not that of a normal service. Transparency will help for some of the issue, but not all. Military medicine (my field) was nothing like civilian. I could save the life of someone without question or giving them a surprise bill when they wake up.

@PBooshay @BernieSanders A good plan would start with the removal of non essential restrictions on small businesses; new laws on oligopolies that use position to limit or thwart any competition; and restriction or removal of any company representation in any proceeding (lobbyists).
@NYNOW_PBS @LarrySharpe We have been playing this debate out at work (while I work on my imitation of larry's voice) so far he wins out vs Cuomo, Bill Clinton, the old man from family guy, Chef, even Mickey mouse (provided they were all candidates)

@BlueEightySix @LPNational @GOP @TheDemocrats If you look, you may well see my principals. I am further centristic than anyone around me. Non partisaned, not interested in financial gain and I come not just out of the gates with a plan, but with years of research and understanding.
@BlueEightySix @LPNational @GOP @TheDemocrats Also, more sensible candidates are coming out lately. Larry is one of the best, but there are plenty others now that I would happily vote for. There are also libertarian leaning Democrat and Republican candidates and seats. If the party grows they will likely change platform.
@BlueEightySix @LPNational @GOP @TheDemocrats I am running for president. I have no results to go from and no other person, short of a previous presidential candidate, can quote any meaningful results on their behalf to answer your question. No other election is the same.
@Omg_Its_Jakez @3dr_Amendment @LPNational Realistically if schools were funded federally and minimum standards were set for teachers using the best school systems to guide it, we would have a far better outcome. Privatized education may have more pitfalls than benefit and lead to a higher rate of uneducated people.
@3dr_Amendment @LPNational A company can easily abuse minimum wage and current labor laws to their advantage. Minimum wage (good or bad) sets a standard wage that effects higher and lower earning potentials. Some would be willing to earn less if it means a job at all to get ahead.
@3dr_Amendment @LPNational Minimum wage changes cost of living. Employees are an expense to a business just like electricity and materials. Raise any one of these costs, the price goes up. In a min wage free system the employees control rates, as similar to materials, no employees means no product.
@StoutParcel @LPNational I've not seen it there, but it is spreading.
@eac4583 @LPNational I believe in boarders. We can be free all we want, but the rest of the world is not idealistically similar. In a perfect world, 100% libertarian belief would be ideal for all, but, we cannot judge the world in a vacuum, only use it to guide us as a constant. (Like lightspeed)
@eac4583 @LPNational Government is not the decider of morality, by definition, society in a whole is. Laws are solid, while morality is fluid. A jury of peers can use morality, while a judge cannot. The only societal need for marriage law is divorce as help, not as condemnment.
@LPNational 	Freedom; is being able to make your own choices. 	Liberty; is being free of the forces that disallow you from making your choices freely.	Responsibility &amp; Compromise; is needed by all free people in order to enjoy a peaceful existance amongst other's beliefs.
@BlueEightySix @LPNational @GOP @TheDemocrats I will cosplay. I do not drink but rarely. I refuse to use drugs. I work for a living. I own/use firearms responsibly. I am atheist and pro life. I will not say you must do as I do. I will not stifle the rights of others to make the choices as I have. To each their own.
@MichaelThau @RonKirbyFan @Roy_Cam Chicken farms out here use insane amounts of electricity. $10,000ish a month in the winter. They are not allowed to use solar unless they are permitted by the power company the state, and the distributor. There is only one I know of that has solar, and they spend $20 every month.
@MichaelThau @RonKirbyFan @Roy_Cam Informative. I know they have a higher output than production cost. They are viable, but the bird issue can be overcome completely by solar if there is incentive to use solar over the cost. Many places make it illegal to be off the power grid or add to it.

@FakeRonBouffon @GOP Not true, if you see a candidate you like, share their message. If we are to have a voice, pick a candidate that represents your values, stick with them and vote, even if you think they may lose, it will empower others to see the numbers and let them know it is ok to have a voice
@PattyArquette @ghads31 That would be us all. Not this generation but 2 or 3 generations from now may see the painful death of millions of people. The laws, the wealth, and the rights we seek now are nothing in comparison to what the world may face if we do not act.

@MichaelThau @RonKirbyFan Solar is a good option as efficiency and batteries get better

@nwnc5th @DavidHeffron @alllibertynews @dotaote @libertarianism It has progressed in views over time, and as such, against even my own prior consideration against it, I have joined. I'm centristic, and lean towards all libertarian values.

@DavidHeffron @nwnc5th @alllibertynews @dotaote @libertarianism You state "we all despise" that is not true. I dont, the other person does not. To whom does "we" refer to and under what authority have you been granted to speak for them?
@Canyonslayer73 @DavidHeffron @arXiv6174 @alllibertynews @johnnylemuria @libertarianism America is comprised in elements of both.

@Canyonslayer73 @arXiv6174 @alllibertynews @johnnylemuria @DavidHeffron @libertarianism Socialism is intended as a "all things equal to the group" which can benefit the group of it is followed. Some use it as a tool to provide a separated upper class with (for all intensive purposes) slaves. Capitalism is not devoid of this pitfall either, as we see today.
@DavidHeffron @dotaote @libertarianism Tresspass does not equal agression in all cases. If I were to trip and fall on to your property, that is still trespassing (or in your words an "initiation of aggression"), it could get me killed. Terminology can be taken advantage of in-full by extremists, much like lawyers.
@DavidHeffron @dotaote @libertarianism Compromise is necessary to life itself. If you want the maximum freedom, you either need to be the most aggressive individual with unabridged control of your domain or a person able to compromise with another's beliefs. They may not  be considered violent in their perspective.
@DavidHeffron @dotaote @libertarianism If I am to follow your current methodology towards me here, you must be advocating murder. 	I am far more centrist than your views. In order for either of our liberties to be preserved, we will need to compromise with all sides. 	A fixed view will almost assuredly fail.
@DavidHeffron @dotaote @libertarianism That makes absolutely no sense to assume advocacy of violence in a defencive position unless that position is defence via offence, which this is not.	How do you treat people you dont know walking into in your family's yard?
@Rayleneamber @mvbcdo @dollarstudent @alllibertynews @libertarianism Minimalist government is not even necessary for removal of this issue. Seeking corruption and disallowing lobbyists a voice in any state or federal decision would stifle it tremendously. A company is not a person or entity with the right to vote.

@juliuscaesarrex @libertarianism @alllibertynews The only thing buddhism has to do with it, is the basis of personal freedom itself.
@juliuscaesarrex @libertarianism @alllibertynews Absolutely, it should be, but it is not. Many religious views have crept into law or practice. The federal holiday of Christmas is a key example or the prohibition of alcohol on sundays in some states.
@DavidHeffron @dotaote @libertarianism I really need to turn this grammar assist off. It's changing some words and that could change the meaning.	"United states if needed" not "United states of needed"
@DavidHeffron @dotaote @libertarianism If you are referring to interstate, the states dot department is (if I remember correctly) the only entity that does.
@DavidHeffron @dotaote @libertarianism The federal government would be the only appropriate entity for this. The boarder would have to coincide with foreign policy and provide initial protection to the United states of needed. A private group is not required inherintly by the constitution to do so.
#DebbieStabenow  Is quoting #libertarian key points, so has many of the prior senators today.

@GOP @DNC, an open letter.	Your continuance of this "show" looks bad for our country in a whole. Confirmation at this point will only cause furthered polarization that will reverberate for years to come and we cannot stand as a nation completely divided amongst ourselves.
@juliuscaesarrex @libertarianism @alllibertynews I am non religious. Believe whatever you want, it is your personal freedom. 		I dont think they were advocating it, as much as just making conversation. LP views do not allow for the party's link to any religion as it would be very counterintuitive. (See #GOP for examples)
@senorrinhatch If a judge was fair, there would be no need for all this from either side. Your position should be the country you live in above the hatred of the opposing. Take a step towards bipartisanship for the sake of our country and listen to the opposing view without dismissing it.
@patrici59152026 @lushstrus @bright_kolleen @justinamash @ALT_uscis When I was younger I could do that, and made around 2k/wk in maryland working 3 jobs (DJ, Carquest, and UTZ). It seemed like jobs were more willing to work with your hours a decade ago.

@PrisonPlanetTV @DRUDGE_REPORT #freespeech does not interfere with the rights of others and doesn't direct others to violate the rights of a third party. Alex Jones' fight is for the opposite of what we know freedom to be, it is for the continuance of hate and misdirection.
@patrici59152026 @lushstrus @bright_kolleen @justinamash @ALT_uscis I dont know. The benefits usually cost more personally without the company paying a portion on discount than the wage increase gives you. Medical for me personally would cost more than double what I make, so they would have to raise my pay 3x higher and I will pay more in taxes.
@RepThomasMassie @justinamash Sans Bill Clinton. We could take many notes from his era and improve on them to eventually phase out income tax and shift federal income to other places.
@justinamash If the workers all leave the company for other jobs the company looses proffit. All jobs exist because the services of a worker contribute to the company's income or goal.
Fec law is oddly specific and seemingly allows wide open loopholes.		I can not coordinate with a business to sponsor a free rally. They can do it on their own. But if I said it would be "nice" (lacking direction) to someone and they coordinated with a business, that's legal.
All rights and freedoms are personal. 	It is when the personal is used against another person that law comes into play. No law should initially intervene in personal freedoms, unless the person willingly choose to wave those rights by agreeance or tresspass against another's.
@Rayleneamber @dollarstudent @alllibertynews @mvbcdo @libertarianism The bigger and more iffy encyclopedia. 		Do you ever "rabbit hole" on wikipedia?
@2020fight This just in, the house down the street from the fox and friend's studio was busted for making 400 lbs over a year of operation. 	(really tho)	What is the point of smuggling 17 lbs when far more is made locally? The criminal(s) here aren't that bright and stole an american job. https://t.co/SPLbCSfr9y
@Rayleneamber @dollarstudent @alllibertynews @mvbcdo @libertarianism "state" is about as diverse as "the f word" 	This leads to "correct sentences" like, "The state states, that the state of the state has become the state.". 		That sentence is somewhat rage inducing!
@Rayleneamber @dollarstudent @alllibertynews @mvbcdo @libertarianism I may be one of the few outright geeks in this world who read encyclopedias and the dictionary like any other book.
@krislewis73 @alllibertynews @libertarianism I was making reference to a more fundamental level of the idea. Yes there are differences in full. What you are referring to is a combination of them on a group scale, not personal liberty, as was my statemen.
@dollarstudent @alllibertynews @Rayleneamber @mvbcdo @libertarianism I am particular on words. The words governance and government are not interchangeable and mean completely different things. You can be self governing, or do self governance, but an individual can not be a group. (Multiple personalities aside 😁 )
@DavidHeffron @libertarianism Btw, I know your statement was a joke in context.
@DavidHeffron @libertarianism There is a line, I'm almost sure that the statement you are referring to cross it, depending on context. 	Much like talking sex to a child. Ok if you are telling your child about birds and bees, not ok if you are telling a random child on the street about your bees.
@libertarianism Freedom of speech is the same as freedom of movement. You do not want someone to pin your arms and legs or stop you from speaking. In the same sense, speech can be an assault on another person just as much as a punch; Speech can control someone just as much as a restraint.
@LPNational It is not the job of government to control substances unless they pose a threat to the population. I.e. Nuclear, Biological, and chemical agents that can affect people against their will. There are some areas on this topic which are beyond  personal choice or the ability of law.
@dotaote @libertarianism Open boarders does not completely entail a lack of checking. In the USA states arent even completely open between each other. (Weigh stations are an example)
@libertarianism I believe the boarder should be open  to Canada and Mexico. All trade should be free of tariffs and soely charged incoming transport fees to assure the safety of our citizens by paying personel with those fees at the boarders to check all transports for illegal items/people.
@dollarstudent @alllibertynews @Rayleneamber @mvbcdo @libertarianism State and government are not seperate ideas. Federal and state governments are relatively the same. Federal controls regulations for all states. While states regulate based on the more specific needs of the people. (Or at least should based on our constitution)
So, clearly push for legalization is due to a lack of intelligence by Americans. (Sarcasm) 		Common sense is not a lack of intelligence. It has no reason to be held as a dangerous substance. This is a major case for personal choice, not government. https://t.co/27vjGjKuxh

@dollarstudent @arXiv6174 @johnnylemuria @fivestarmichael @DavidHeffron @alllibertynews @libertarianism Correction, main objective.
@dollarstudent @arXiv6174 @johnnylemuria @fivestarmichael @DavidHeffron @alllibertynews @libertarianism Do not take my generalized statements as a lack of knowledge. It would be better taken as a lack of patience to deal with the hostility to any other view but your own and the pointless nature of any attempt to discuss it through thoughtful conversation.
@dollarstudent @arXiv6174 @johnnylemuria @fivestarmichael @DavidHeffron @alllibertynews @libertarianism Example: 5 people plot to shoot up a school. If we caught them before they committed a crime. It would not be inherintly right under a victimless mindset to convict them without a crime being committed and no actual victims or ultimate choice to go through with the crime.
@dollarstudent @arXiv6174 @johnnylemuria @fivestarmichael @DavidHeffron @alllibertynews @libertarianism I have no idea and nobody can until there is an agreed line in the sand that dictates what exactly is a victim based crime is. Some are cut and dry right and wrong, some are heavy on grey areas that could be right even tho they are inherintly wrong.
@dollarstudent @arXiv6174 @johnnylemuria @fivestarmichael @DavidHeffron @alllibertynews @libertarianism To answer anyways, if America took the third Reich path. (Which is possible in our duopoly) I would fight the full on US military with a stick if it came to it.
@iNCNF @SteveMcNY @LarrySharpe Only if people do not stand up for themselves. 	Btw, libertarian is good for gun owners.
@dollarstudent @arXiv6174 @johnnylemuria @fivestarmichael @DavidHeffron @alllibertynews @libertarianism That makes absolutely no sense. There is an area in between these two wildly opposing ideas.
@dollarstudent @arXiv6174 @johnnylemuria @fivestarmichael @DavidHeffron @alllibertynews @libertarianism Secession does not implicate war. The north both wanted the south's resources and the freedom of the slaves which later became the north's sole objective.

@RonKirbyFan Clearly it's not an American only issue, however, it is one that our country can make progress towards eliminating.

@RealPaulWinters @Alyssa_Milano @DonaldJTrumpJr No matter what sick tactic may have been used by the democrats, Dr Ford is a private citizen of this damn country. @RealPaulWinters, you don't seem to understand the basics of dignity that is deserved by a private citizen. No person should be humiliated as a potential victim.
Ladies and Gentlemen, this is our #POTUS. 	#MAGA supporters,	This is not making America great. This is the person who swore to protect us from enemies both foreign and domestic. She was assaulted in the 80's and is now being verbally assaulted and mocked by the potus. https://t.co/uhDhw390GP
@arXiv6174 @fivestarmichael @johnnylemuria @alllibertynews @DavidHeffron @libertarianism That was a relatively close race. Did you see the independance ads? They were a bit pointed towards saying scots are too hard headed for change.
If your preference of school for your children involves a consideration of what race the other children are, you  are teaching your children racism, no matter what race you are.

@fivestarmichael @JonasAfrend @DavidHeffron @arXiv6174 @johnnylemuria @alllibertynews @libertarianism You have a point and I stand corrected on taoism. Buddhism has rules to be followed and Diesm is akin to atheism. Taoism is a religion that could be had with true anarchy.
@johnnylemuria @arXiv6174 @fivestarmichael @DavidHeffron @alllibertynews @libertarianism I was one in highschool... I am well aware of the ideology. You can mask it in any way you want, but there is no way it would work outside of unrealistic dreams.
@JonasAfrend @DavidHeffron @fivestarmichael @arXiv6174 @johnnylemuria @alllibertynews @libertarianism A theistic ruler is still a ruler. You still pay for crimes in the afterlife, etc. I have no heard of a religion that does not state consequences for actions in life in one way or another.
@johnnylemuria @arXiv6174 @fivestarmichael @DavidHeffron @alllibertynews @libertarianism That system by definition would not be anarchy.
@johnnylemuria @DavidHeffron @fivestarmichael @arXiv6174 @alllibertynews @libertarianism The disagreement would not be based on the definition.
@DavidHeffron @fivestarmichael @arXiv6174 @johnnylemuria @alllibertynews @libertarianism Anarchy also requires a lack of religion, which is authoritative. This will simply never happen sans a local or global catastrophe, even then authorative groups will occur amongst anarchy. It is an inevitable human direction.
@elonmusk @cleantechnica Unfortunately negative publications get higher response rates. Our use of historic data in media (like most industries now) may lead to a furtherance of negative news stories. It will eventually give way once historic data useage in the wrong places starts reducing proffit.
@all_out_sec @JustABitAlien @FLitz @elonmusk @cleantechnica It's not in a bad way. But it can get taken out of context to be.
@arlethapappas @SenGillibrand It is my goal to see false promises, tampering, and hatred in candidacy give way to honesty, and civility. Changing the way we vote will help persue that effort, among many other issues we face, as a people of the United States.
@arlethapappas @SenGillibrand Infringement on voting rights is the limitation of the power of the people. I will get together with people to draft a bill that disallows infringement of these rights in majority; that eliminates downvote practices; reduces fraud; and eliminates registration requirements.
@arlethapappas @SenGillibrand 3 part answer.		As president, there is not as much power as you would think to change these, as it would take congressional approval for any longstanding change. But it can be done under the right circumstances and effort.
@johnnylemuria @ThomasEWoods @arXiv6174 @alllibertynews @DavidHeffron @libertarianism So, does this mean the goal is dissolution of all government, or a position that is ment to reduce it's reach as part of the whole ideology.
@RonKirbyFan In colorado where it is legal. The traffic related deaths are 8%(weed) vs 26%(alcohol). USA in a whole sees more than 200 times more alcohol related deaths than weed. Alcohol related death is also 3 times higher than gun related (including suicide)
@ThomasEWoods @arXiv6174 @johnnylemuria @alllibertynews @DavidHeffron @libertarianism If you are referring to the anarchist wishes, that is not lp ideology so far as I've seen, that is a minority opinion of people who want to use lp as a means to steer that direction. There is a major difference between them. It looked anarchistic from the outside.
@ThomasEWoods @arXiv6174 @johnnylemuria @alllibertynews @DavidHeffron @libertarianism @ThomasEWoods, The party itself was not exactly attractive to me until I started learning of its follower's stances. That is what attracted me. If @LPNational has a different stance than it's following, it is doomed to failure, plain and simple.
@TheLoveBel0w @Ocasio2018 It is easier to deny future income than it is to spend your bank roll where it comes to a higher income for yourself. Cut taxes to the American people first, not companies. We can make our own opportunities if we have the means to do so.
I have noticed this effect directly via a segmented family of divorce. One parent was poor, one was well off. We were split up between the two. The results are obvious. https://t.co/Ep4vhifmkx
@GOP @kayleighmcenany In a disturbing way, no, it will not. They are using a tactic because they are a minority vote. When Republicans are the minority the same will occur (and has). It is not right or democratic for either party to play this game of thrones. (Pun intended)
@arlethapappas @SenGillibrand I can't answer that question. It is, however, one of the reasons why I am running. Granted, sometimes the obvious may not be best, but, in this instance I think it may be intentionally overlooked.
@arlethapappas @SenGillibrand That is actually part of my stance, allow digital booths, that give you a receipt of your vote and a second receipt for paper record much like credit cards work. This way, there can be faster results along with paper backup.
@fivestarmichael @arXiv6174 @johnnylemuria @alllibertynews @DavidHeffron @libertarianism Imagine a mile of highway where one or two people are sometimes traveling any lane in any direction, it is not too bad, now multiply travelers by a thousand on that same stretch. This is anarchy and it does nothing for a much larger population.
@arlethapappas @SenGillibrand We inherently created the problem as voters by party prioritized voting and giving in to the downvote trend (dv is how other countries can easily interfere now). We need to now halt the trend so that we can amend what we have done.
@arlethapappas @SenGillibrand The numbers show that this should not be the case. Everyone needs to get out and vote!
@arlethapappas @SenGillibrand The public call he made to hack the emails is definitely evidence. Would you rather justice in this or a rush to an impeachment that would inevitably fail for obvious reasons and stifle any furthered chance of justice?
@dbearp @QHTown @RepMaxineWaters It shows this as a reply to my message, I think it was meant for the original posting. 		In no way shape or form do I support those acts. I find them outright appalling, even moreso being inter-party. The idea that they would do this to their own, leads me to fear for the public.
@arXiv6174 @johnnylemuria @alllibertynews @DavidHeffron @libertarianism This should help a little. 	https://t.co/diolZ4PekT
@arXiv6174 @johnnylemuria @alllibertynews @DavidHeffron @libertarianism In a broad sense, socialism includes car insurance, and roadways.  Elements of socialism are essential to a modern society. Otherwise libertarianism would be closer to outright anarchy, something I do not think I've seen a single libertarian wish for.
#QuestionOfTheDay 	Where do you stand on #weed?		I've never personally witnessed any reason to include it as a schedule 1 drug. I would never veto a bill that calls for it's complete removal from law outside of lacking an age requirement for legal use and sale.
@arlethapappas @SenGillibrand Impeachment requires solid evidence. Even then, it should be avoided under a Republican controlled congress, for obvious reasons.
@NegusHamitic @SenGillibrand Green is explicitly not the #maga way... Weed, environment, aliens, etc.
@Rob162816 @SenGillibrand It is close to elections... many things will get done per the popular opinion for votes. This is normal and is the best time to talk to your representitives. (Its not right, but its true)

@RedTRaccoon The two people I would very much like to meet and talk to one day, even if I don't attain office.

@arXiv6174 @DavidHeffron @alllibertynews @libertarianism I have it in cue.
@arXiv6174 @DavidHeffron @alllibertynews @libertarianism The form you are referring to is not well known. Generally it is used to control a population, I do believe that is what the reference is about. I may be mistaken.
@arXiv6174 @DavidHeffron @alllibertynews @libertarianism I openly believe it depends. It's not inherently evil, but it is used that way. Like water, it can be used to help, tourture, even kill.
@arXiv6174 @alllibertynews @libertarianism Not a bad thing for those people. It works well as it seems for their case.
@arXiv6174 @alllibertynews @libertarianism In the purest form from the looks of it.
I have officially joined the #libertarian party. I have looked into many people of the party over the past 6 months. They're mostly fluid in their ideology and a large portion is made of #independant people. This acceptance of different opinions is key to my choice.
@LPNational https://t.co/Fnn6reEijp
@LeemanDamon @LPNational Did you know that the traffic is about equal into the USA as out from our boarder with Mexico, and that we provide Mexico with a much higher % of "criminals" in the process? Also, the crime among illegal immigrants is significantly lower per person than the average US citizen.
@LeemanDamon @LPNational The difference is? You can put nearly anything across a boarder. Unless you stop all commerce and travel in and out, it is only a figurative line with a tangible cost.
@LPNational "Government is to be used to maintain peaceful order amongst the chaos. It should be used to the benefit the whole of its citizens, not the few that know how to use it." -William Hurst
@_femkilljoi @LPNational To which party are you referring? The premise of libertarianism is liberty. This is for all. Not rich, not poor, but the civil liberties we should all enjoy. There are 3 types of poor in this country. 2 of which are not legitimate, and claim the title.
@LPNational The absolute war on drugs and the way it is handled is insane. Some are a very public problem that can cause further crimes in theft and violence. We need to find a way to better deal with the issue, but, it is still an issue that needs a means to an end.
@arXiv6174 @alllibertynews @libertarianism So far as I've read, I dont think the premise would work in America. It weighs on trust and community. We have vastly separated communities, even in the same neighborhood sometimes.
@AnnCoulter Our vote and our vote alone, can change the face of this country. We have the ultimate power to change how we feel about our government. This is a democracy, this is America.

@QHTown @RepMaxineWaters I.e. what is happening to kavenaugh now... they are waiting to save their own votes in midterms.
@QHTown @RepMaxineWaters I disagree a little. They do, just enough to get re-elected, they will also distance themselves as far from trump as they can if the impeachment takes place. Backing him after it starts will lead to a loss of votes. I think they value their income more than link to him.
#QuestionOfTheDay 	Why aren't you pressing hard for donations yet?		I think this next election is one of the most important #Midterms we have had in a long time. This could take away from some of the better candidates chances. I've been donating to many campaigns to help.

@LarrySharpe We have the overwhelmingly useful ability to lookup providers nowadays. Licensing has lost it's need for the majority of professions where the consequences of their inabilities will not effect the life of another.
@TomiLahren If by "droves" you mean a slightly higher % turnout of white voters and a significantly lower turnout of black voters, (legitimtely enough to change the election) then sure.
@gahwillie @GeneLingerfelt 240 characters forces generalizations. An observed history would need a lot of links. I dont see anyone doing this unless writing an article. I certainly am not talking that time on a broad topic.
@gahwillie @GeneLingerfelt Yes, there are some easily searchable issues with small and major n4p organizations.
@Angry_Husky @alllibertynews @nickgillespie @LPNational Absolutely, outside of benefiting Republican agenda, there is no reason to have him there, where it comes to properly doing their job.
@RonKirbyFan No, I'll look it up. I've heard recently they had some gerrymandering issues in parlament. (Its something we will face soon)
@2020fight Alyssa milano was one I was looking at earlier... burning holes in his head.
Today has confirmed one thing. I am joining @LPNational. They are needed in the years to come. We need to end this display of hatred for votes. Libertarian is not a singular view but a common goal of liberty.
@RonKirbyFan Scotland is trying to secede from great brittan in the midst of this. Oddly they can look at the USA as inspiration to keep out the pitfalls and keep the good parts to form a far better union. They have a great chance to do that now.
@RonKirbyFan I hope the horror show I witnessed does. We need libertarian as a third major party in a bad way, I'm not one based on my views, yet, they are necessary and represent a middle of the road view.
@RonKirbyFan Did you know Canada was offered inclusion into the USA in 1781? That was when we were like europe is now (under our articles of confederation), until the constitution was made.
@RonKirbyFan Same, I'm busy avoiding politics for a moment, it's making me sick thinking about what we seen today.
@RonKirbyFan Kind of, but we are all very similar. As for the world... Maybe, but I think our formation wouldn't work globally. Europe is trying this now, and it's odd to see the attempt as it looks eerily similar to the USA under the articles.
@RonKirbyFan I dont mean to unload my database matrix style, lol. I think I may be coming across as too much boring info too fast.
@RonKirbyFan Yes, the USA motto is "e pluribus unum". It has the states in mind here, but I am using in the context of people and unity among the chaos.
@RonKirbyFan The understanding is no bis bene nemini male (funny side note: male in latin is bad)
@RonKirbyFan "Out of many, we can be one" or "of many, one possible"
@RonKirbyFan Not really, it's the basis of most modern language... just combining words insinuates others, not as direct as english. I'm not 100% fluent by any means, but a decent understanding helps scientific/medical nomenclature and law.
@RonKirbyFan Haha, no. I can read it tho... like my motto, "e pluribus unum possimus"
Was that @Alyssa_Milano behind #Kavanaugh ? If so that explains the looks. I thought it was his "people" as he stated.
#QuestionOfTheDay 	How would you pick a judge to appoint?		Sit in their courtroom or record their hearings for a watch. If they are willing to make decisions against their personal beliefs soely based on law, that is almost perfection.
@MiraSorvino Join me to take America back.
@RonKirbyFan I kind of do the same, on the fly education for specifics, however, it takes a very broad and basic understanding in any area... also... Latin helps.
@RonKirbyFan It was the first I could find. There are near death experiments and some others that I've seen in the past. My medical knowledge is not heavy on the frontlines of research. I was trained as a 91w and I also prefer physics/astronomy. I catch that knowledge in passing.
@PattyArquette @SenatorCollins @JeffFlake @SenBobCorker @RepMaxineWaters @SenSchumer @RepAdamSchiff @CoryBooker @SenJeffMerkley @SenMarkey Do I believe he did it? Now I do. Should it be played out this way? Resoundingly no.
@PattyArquette @SenatorCollins @JeffFlake @SenBobCorker @RepMaxineWaters @SenSchumer @RepAdamSchiff @CoryBooker @SenJeffMerkley @SenMarkey It is common, as of late, to deny action that may prove guilt. FBI investigation, however, is really not his call to make. It is a confirmation circus of hard headed left and right. I'm more ashamed of congress at this point than I am of the guy sitting in front of them.
@gahwillie @GeneLingerfelt That was in the 1860s not the 1960s
@gahwillie @GeneLingerfelt Charitable has a history of becoming proffit driven over the past couple decades. It would be nice to have that segment work as intended, yet it does not.
#KavanaughHearings	I was originally making a statement of "not enough evidence to make any decision on this", but, in the last couple minutes of questions, I am no longer inclined to believe him at all.
@nelsonjeff05 @shannonrwatts It is called an emotional tell.
@nelsonjeff05 @shannonrwatts The other catch would be the present situation, however, he would have been acting that way after her testimony not durring his at the onset of recollection of that time in question.
@nelsonjeff05 @shannonrwatts Angry. I have seen countless people lieing about the past cry when the memory is true. Sharing a true painful past event is one that causes this as well. However you can fake tears for a past event but it is not easy. He is either honestly crying or should earn an emmy.
#kavanaughcrying	I'm having a hard time understanding this crying, he has been dealing with this for a while now. Its genuine. But it seems like a fearful cry. I would expect him to be angry under false accusation.
@Becky91663 She may be honest on accusations, but this is a play that had to be sure before playing?
The truth about today is that things are getting better across the world. Many attrocities still happen, tho, if you look at history, you will be glad you lived in this era, and, may be hoping for the next.
@KimStrassel This is something I said would happen on Ms. Milano's page when it started. It had/has the potential to discredit the entire movement and hurt abused people's credibility by giving a very public case law to defenders of rape.
@2020fight I'm in question over whether that even matters, how about a reboot of non corrupt and unbiased people of any shape, sex, color, or preference.
This would end the the driving force of our current political divide and help harbor compromise between conflicting views. That is the one of the jobs of the president, that as of late, we have not seen effectively used.
#QuestionOfTheDay 	What would you do about congress if you were in office today?		I would propose a bill ending party based minority shutouts and have a like minded congress person introduce it, so that we can avoid unilateral decisions and promote a fully functional congress.
@Dennis_35901 That would be hearsay evidence, if they allow that, they will undermine the entirety of the legal system. Direct witness testimony is the only valid source of verbal testimony. (Short of ad litem if it's a child or expert testimony when needed)
@Dennis_35901 @BuckSexton @DineshDSouza FBI involvement can easily prove if she had on digital media, and sheer testimony would rule out hearsay. It would be detrimental to our system of law to not hear her out with evidence for and against. However, if it's a lie/tactical this will come back around to hurt democrats.
@realDonaldTrump Unanimous confirmation would be the sign of qualified. The man he will replace came after two failed attempts, and was unanimously voted for by congress, a decision which was right by history. Any good you may well be underwritten to this decision.
I would rather a world that laughs at American comedians than the country and the president. We are losing our trust to the world that we all are a part of.
@DDAlabama I'm happy to have started as a regular before I started working at one of these locations. I defected from the more expensive (and bitter) competition because of the cold brew.
@Suidae_Empathy @mobilematt @StephenKing They were, however, dont let that fool you, those laws were written by the same ideological party. Democrats and Republicans switched and polarized in the 60's due to the civil rights movement. Alabama as a prime example, it used to be democratic until then.
@pjtaylorphoto @mobilematt @StephenKing Stephen king knows monsters...
@cactusvalleymom @mobilematt @StephenKing A pink floyd song "hey you" is stuck in my head now. 🎵 and the worms ate into his brain 🎵
@StephenKing Maybe we should keep a running bills/votes online database. This would keep them in check by the public and assure they don't continue the "change up on election time" style voting we see from them. Full accountability for all good or bad.
@BetteMidler Stop by the one I work at and I can comp you some.
@BetteMidler We have been saying dunkin' for a while now. It's a coffee shop with bonus donuts!
@charliekirk11 This is both parties, to be honest. Just depends on which type of special interest is paying.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I'm actually appalled by some of the  #maga supporters. The comments I have seen on this thread are some of the most ovetly racist I have seen here on twitter. Also, going as far as wishing death on a fellow American for an opposing view is absurd. Check your humanity.
@afutater @BarackObama I think that is a blue wash. Polls show a blue/independant lead on points that are the highest in history. In Republican areas the lead is marginal. Lead or not, every voter must still turn out. Make your voice heard as a unified majority!
@BarackObama I kind of wonder if he reads his tweets.
@dinewithkaren @BarackObama My motto is "of many, we can be one"
@Mooglet1 @Gioiosa707 @BarackObama Nice
@RonKirbyFan I used to talk politics in a very global forum almost a decade ago (albertastars) it represented views from all over the world without a huge issue of trolls, but, due to some of the free speech at play it disappeared.
@RonKirbyFan Like this, however the implications of cut and dry evidence against it could hurt a lot of people. Religion is a good thing sometimes and does help people. Until it is used for just cause of war. https://t.co/Rx250KAlUj
@RonKirbyFan Are you living stateside?
@RonKirbyFan The guy who left, kennedy, was the result of the exact same issues. Ford tried to pass (as well as nixon), multiple first choice candidates that failed kennedy was intensely scrutinized, and won by unanimous decision. The position is the tie break spot on scotus
@RonKirbyFan They have! There is a multitude of ongoing studies in medical science to confirm or deny.
@RonKirbyFan We lost the ability for that to be true forever. Per net neutrality laws being lost.
@RonKirbyFan Really it could play out very badly. Not 100% sure that it would go that way, but the risk is far to high.
@RonKirbyFan I dont have to, I'm unpartisaned and too random in my research for google. However it will lean towards science if there is a conflict between politics and science searches.
@RonKirbyFan In a way no, but, the we have never had the government as stacked as it is now, even with that on the precipice, a singular view wont be total dictatorship, it will have the guise of liberty, just for a portion of the population.
@RonKirbyFan Google's filter is inherent to the platform. Realistically you can see your own bias by using it. Try making a biased account it will show biased results.
@RonKirbyFan If we get kavanaugh it could be a dictatorship alongside the Republican majority in all cabinets and the (shady but real) ability to maintain that majority no matter what the votes may be.
@RonKirbyFan I at least understand their filter, on face value, he has said some things that could get you banned on here, and I'm plenty sure he was reported many times over as with some other people, like James woods and the infowars guy.
@RonKirbyFan This is the reason I've switched to twitter. There is clearly separation in its timeline. I have gop, dem, lib, and ind friends. They will not show me gop based posts at all, and will not share my posts to friends who are rep or dem, unless we specifically go to a profile.
@RonKirbyFan I'm bailing the thread.
@RonKirbyFan Its definately confusing.
@RonKirbyFan Venezuelan people... or are we on two seperate topics now? I still get the tweets from the other guy.
#SCOTUS stacking is not, nor should ever be considered beneficial to democracy. This leads to single party control and disallows more than half of the population from representation. Look up Robert Bork for more of the same issue after Nixon.
@RonKirbyFan But how capable will they be at that point?
@MarkMichaeldom @RonKirbyFan @rebel_romantic @alllibertynews @LeeCamp @GovJVentura Heh, prima nocta, or "before night" was the act of a controlling lord mating with a bride before the husband is allowed to consummate the marriage. This tried to assure their heritage was bred out. But they got wise and consummation was done before to hinder that.
@MarkMichaeldom @RonKirbyFan @rebel_romantic @alllibertynews @LeeCamp @GovJVentura They are too shaken and struggling on life itself to try, that is the major issue, they are facing ecological disaster as well as food shortage and the cost is only going up. Gas however is insanely cheap.
@charliekirk11 No, not all. Accusations aside, he should have been denied on the spot for party biased decisions, and statements to that effect. That is not the purpose of the supreme court, merit of law should be the only deciding factor. Republican or Democrat, that shouldn't exist.
@jenniferm_q @ENBrown @KatMurti @FeministLiberty I had to do a double take on that... I mean it's very much done in the prison system, but what? There has to be another way that is a little less  (no word comes to mind). There are definately other ways to handle that issue.
Sometimes the weak can be powerful. https://t.co/TRj6YblsKO
@MarkMichaeldom @RonKirbyFan @rebel_romantic @alllibertynews @LeeCamp @GovJVentura That is a last measure situation. I dont think even trump (or for that matter the secretary of defence) would start right into violence. We have a due process on that, unless we are attacked first. We are not a country of extremists. We save the extremes for internal stuff.
@MarkMichaeldom @RonKirbyFan @rebel_romantic @alllibertynews @LeeCamp @GovJVentura What is going on in Venezuela right now, may well be an attempt to halt resistance in favor of a change in government.
@MarkMichaeldom @RonKirbyFan @rebel_romantic @alllibertynews @LeeCamp @GovJVentura Prima nocta in medieval europe,  was an attempt to breed out resistance.
@MarkMichaeldom @RonKirbyFan @rebel_romantic @alllibertynews @LeeCamp @GovJVentura The threat of full u.s. force can de-escalate the potential for violence and push for peaceful resolve. Essentially scare the crap out of the government so they will not attack the citizens and allow them a voice to repeal.
@MarkMichaeldom @RonKirbyFan @rebel_romantic @alllibertynews @LeeCamp @GovJVentura First step would be talk to their leadership. Second step, park an aircraft carrier offshore.
@MarkMichaeldom @RonKirbyFan @rebel_romantic @alllibertynews @LeeCamp @GovJVentura War is literally fighting for the capitualilation of one idea or the possession of something. War is not just weapons and death, however as saddening as it may be that is the most effective form it takes.
#Venezuela. We need to intervene. The people need liberation and call to us for help. Had France not done the same for us, we would not be the USA. We are in a position to truely pay it forward. It is our responsibility to do so as humans, not just a country.
@RonKirbyFan @MarkMichaeldom @rebel_romantic @alllibertynews @LeeCamp @GovJVentura War is also conducted without weapons. Look at Venezuela, a country that has a population calling for American intervention because their government is conducting a form of war on it's own population to change the democratic government. This is one that we should hear their cries
@RonKirbyFan Ooh wow, without context that's kind of odd.
@RonKirbyFan I understand, however I will hear people out first, or in his case, try. I'm 80% sure he is not a native english speaking person. I had a somewhat similar conversation with Israeli nationals a few days ago that were on vacation. They came off that way at first too.
@RonKirbyFan @alllibertynews @rebel_romantic Taking the step to fully honor defence of allies and withdraw sales in trade for finance of the military would be good, if we can establish a trust on that level with allies. It will take hard work for peace.
@RonKirbyFan @alllibertynews @rebel_romantic I do disagree, this day and age, weapons are a necessity. Halting manufacture would not stop armed conflict, just create easy targets. It will take the entire world to become unified before we can lay down arms together. We are slowly progressing towards that direction.
@MarkMichaeldom @RonKirbyFan @alllibertynews @rebel_romantic @LeeCamp @GovJVentura Where is "here"?
@MarkMichaeldom @RonKirbyFan @alllibertynews @rebel_romantic @LeeCamp @GovJVentura Defence is one thing. Having to potentially defend yourself vs your own weapons is another. Thankfully we are not selling the f22, yet. We have the capability to take a role in strictly defence of all our allies, we should offer that with a stipulation of no offensive action.
@RonKirbyFan @alllibertynews @rebel_romantic No small wonder citizens in foreign countries fear the USA with certain politicians at the helm. While it is good for us in some ways, it hurts us in others unless we (as a country) coalm the fears and use the power appropriately.
@TheEconomist @alllibertynews Between states many do this with some common goods to weigh state taxes and cost of living there. Cigarettes are usually the go-to, whether you smoke or not.
@RonKirbyFan @alllibertynews @MarkMichaeldom @rebel_romantic @LeeCamp @GovJVentura The sale of f-16 and other aircraft are a very lucrative business. Something we should not be in the business of doing. We should instead make and uphold defense treaties. This quasi hands clean approach is not much different than just doing it ourselves, responsibly.
@Rocky4President @JohnHargenrader @LPNational @adamkokesh Well... homer Simpson has won an election before... it's not impossible. Follow your dreams kitty.
@Rocky4President @JohnHargenrader @LPNational @adamkokesh I can't vote for you... you're boring, lol.
@TwitterGov is a great idea. Information is vital, and this platform is now the go-to great-equilizer for political discussion.
RT @TwitterGov: Today, Twitter is launching our #BeAVoter campaign to promote increased, informed participation in the 2018 US election.		L…
@jermanicus169 Then tape it back together, send it in, and vote for me and almost any independant or libertarian. We all will assuredly attempt to change that with a few years.
#BeAVoter no matter what you believe, voting is your power in government. There is no power greater if you know all the candidates and vote for who best represents you.
@David_J_Bier News that was not a big to-do...	https://t.co/2iLxbr2oQZ
Stories that focus on a certain political view are the ones we hear about. My biological father, who had multiple women come out against him after he forcefully molested my neice, it was a small news story. https://t.co/2iLxbr2oQZ https://t.co/Ze33PcmY02
#QuestionOfTheDay 	Do you think the Democrats will #metoo you in some way if you get on their radar?		It would be an extremely pointless endeavor if you knew me personally. I know the tactics that will be used against me, by all parties. This one is the least likely.
@Rocky4President @JohnHargenrader @LPNational @adamkokesh Munchies?
@Rocky4President @JohnHargenrader @LPNational @adamkokesh There is a stigma attached. I'm a nonsmoker, by personal choice. It does not mean that I'm blind to other people's use. (No pun intended)
@JohnHargenrader @Rocky4President @LPNational @adamkokesh In my life of 35 years, I've not seen "pot" cause a problem with anyone outside of legal. Alcohol, on the other hand, is the cause of many ruined lives and deaths. Look up the total of lives lost by drunk drivers.
@LPNational Let me iterate that the draw for me is the open nature of varying ideas, and the lack of peddling hatred. The detractor for me would be the idea of ideas of government. Does this mean only where necessary or total removal of even some founding ideas?
@LPNational I'm still on the fence. There are a lot of good libertarian candidates. Sometimes democrat and Republican are better options. It really depends on the person more than the party imo. Personally, I've never identified with a party. I identify with research into each person.
@LarrySharpe @LPNational I know the legitimate costs of some of these items and the work to do them. This is a buddy buddy deal using taxpayers money. If you have the time/resources, look into the contractors connections with who hired him and approved their expenses. They may be friends.
@LPNational @LarrySharpe Traffic in NYC is a pain, and from an outsider's perspective there are too many taxis that take a single person and that's it. The efficiency of the roadway and transit system seems aweful compared to other places.
#QuestionOfTheDay	If you became president, what would you do in your first day?		I do believe there are a few other things that must take place that day, for my time in between, I'll wander the entire whitehouse like I dreamed about as a kid when I visited it under Clinton.
@Dennis_35901 I dont think team voting (gop or dem) will help our country. We have to study every candidate. I will vote for any candidate that will do the job properly without promising things that they have no ability to change, or outright lieing to the American people.
@Dennis_35901 I wont argue his experience, good or bad risks that come with the territory, he has made a lot of money.
@Dennis_35901 So far federal expenses and foreign government expenses have netted his businesses an extra 10+ million. Just in position alone his investments have seen a 25% increase. That figure is over 40% government based expendatures in miralago and trump tower alone.
@Dennis_35901 Dennis, you know first hand how much research I do. I'll look up the actual numbers again, later, but trump businesses are getting more than the 400k he is waving on salary, directly from federal expenses.
@gahwillie @GeneLingerfelt Aspects of socialism are necessary,  if we do not confuse them with true socialism, we all benefit. Car insurance, roadways, bailouts, economic stimulus, social security, even disability (sometimes part of ss) are all socialistic.
@Dennis_35901 The house of representitives are intentionally in place for that. The presidents cabinet is only responsible for sending a budget request to them. Business minded persons should represent the people in the house. The only power of purse is due to military experiences in war.
@RealCandaceO @charliekirk11 I would be more than willing to take that 100k for a debate.
@RealCandaceO, 	There is no difference between what you are firing at the democrats and what they are firing back. It is the same rhetoric with a different agenda. We should be looking for cohesion, not a furtherance of polar hostilities with our fellow country men and women.
#QuestionOfTheDay: Don't you need experience in politics to run for President?	No, Trump and now Bloomberg along with many others have run. The difference being, they have money to do it and money to make from it. I do not, my only interest is damage control and the future.
@Loponstorm @michaelcmaronna @tonybennett_ @OfficialSPGB @PrisonPlanet Watch ....any.... foreign news. Some say the collapse of American union is imminent. Egypt has a headline of "The new hitler" I could go on for about a hundred or more tweets here. The general world view is not positive in any way, even by our allies.
@OfficialSPGB @PrisonPlanet That would be nearly impossible for him to try. It takes long enough to block one, imagine 20-30k with multiple accounts.
@PrisonPlanet @AmericanPride89 Look at his posts, I think they speak for themselves. They are getting to the point of outright hate speech. The removal may have been on the reports due to its political nature, but I'm sure the decision has to do with the hatred displayed. (Also against tos)
@show_tao @alllibertynews @OutlawedMind @mvbcdo @Blooshier @KatyOldenburg @solsberrymike @ByuliMae @Watchman1111 @BrightVision9 @GOP @LPNational @NationalDebt @Antiwarcom You do understand a puppet will be more sucessful aligned with controlling party in congress right? The president can not change law, taxes, or treaty without the consent of congress and supreme court rulings (or choosing not to rule) on orders.
I've been ignoring Alex Jones for a long time now because of his angry and blatantly false "strawman" style theories geared towards fear mongering. I see the world has finally put their fingers in their ears too, +1 for humanity, humility, and general sanity.
@AnnCoulter I have looked personally into many rulings and public statements, I do not care what the democrats say is their issue, my issue is that he follows party lines, no party based bias should ever be part of the supreme court. That is dangerous to our country.
@gahwillie @GeneLingerfelt The modern Republican party is the old democratic party. The name changed, the people didn't, you can ask all the older people in alabama, they remember.
@StaceyM03904565 @GeneLingerfelt @DineshDSouza Abolish the party structure all together.
@thehill I have not, nor have I ever, frankly, I'm quite appalled by that insinuation. This is is something I have said would happen with this movement 3 years ago and here it is, playing out as predicted.
Here is the deal with google search... look up the search statistics on a topic, what more people are interested in, is what gets the rank. Its tried and true.
RT @Becky91663: Political Cartoons by Steve Breen https://t.co/RI7plrP49E
@Becky91663 Exactly
My daughter popped out of nowhere yelling... "I'm cutting taxes... and people!". I dont think a single person in that store was able to stop laughing. https://t.co/Nayd3zGWF8
@DennisW70402864 That's what I intend on. :-)
@samdobermann @HillsHandmades I'm going to fight it out whether it makes sense or not, if possible, stand amongst them in a debate, even if it is just to show America that sanity still exists.
@samdobermann @HillsHandmades I live in Alabama and I am not a Republican, religious, or an au/al fan. The chances of becoming a giant purple guy with a wierd chin (thanos) are far better than holding office here as a stepping stone.
@sumbodysbabygrl That's human nature. I'm not a person of faith, but, I do know your (christian?) faith does dictate self defence (luke 22:36). Personally, what I did still haunts me as much as what he did.
#BadlyExplainedBands 	I dont know exactly who they are, but they dont like a lot of people, specifically the guy who operates the rogue river drawbridge in delray on jefferson. https://t.co/e1aBwcYOxc
@UNSEATpac @ChuckGrassley No, it is politically primed. It was for the world to hear, and I for one would rather this played out public drama not become the norm. Release a statement not just a tweet.
@creynoldsnc @Armintakamille I'm not exactly comfortable talking about it and never have before now, minus 2 people in my life who know the details. But, if my horror becomes someone's will to fight for themselves, I'll share.
@HillsHandmades It feels wierd sharing this publically. I don't know if many people can stand with me on the side of sucessfully fighting back, so thanks. It needs to be made more aware to every person to say something asap, dont be afraid to fight your attack durring or after.
I was a child. No child should have to deal with sexual attack and the fear of death from an adult. But, if it weren't for that, I would not be the  person I am today, as it abruptly opened my eyes to the reality of the world around me.
#WhyIDidntReport	Because, what he tried to do and the fear of jail for what I did to him in return. 20 years and I still can't tell my dreams to stop seeing his older broken and bloodied face laying there, gasping for breath, even knowing what I did in self defence was justified.
@maddow Take a week off, avoid the news. See what you come back to.
Millions of pictures, let that sink in a little. An average photo shoot may be around 200 photos, small scale, around 50. https://t.co/qYH0q51Jx3
@DrLocoFoco @libertarianism @alllibertynews I dont honestly remember if it did or not. It was about 20 years ago (15y/o). I was into encyclopedias and text books in an abusive home then. I really don't get shocked by humanity as I've seen the best and worst firsthand.
