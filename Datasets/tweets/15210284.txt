When it comes to the future of the SCOTUS, here’s how respondents believe Kavanaugh’s nomination could change the rulings: https://t.co/u1zmiDePlQ
Following Kavanuagh’s swearing in, Chief Justice Roberts said “[...] We do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle, we do not caucus in separate rooms, we do not serve one party or one interest, we serve one nation. And I want to assure all of you that we will continue to do that.”
Justices Kavanaugh and Roberts would likely handle the issue of precedent differently if asked to return to Roe v. Wade. #NJWebinar https://t.co/Qpyqg2BEiq
There has been an increase in state-enacted legislation that restricts abortion access or procedures since Roe v. Wade—34% of them were enacted between January 2011 and January 2018. #NJWebinar
High-profile cases on abortion fall into two primary categories: Procedural (doctors must have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals) and time restriction (states wanting to ban abortion after a certain length of time). #NJWebinar
Here is the #efficiencygap as it applies to Wisconsin: https://t.co/BqBXd9JKmA
Efficiency Gap = (Percentage of seats held – 50%) – [2 x (Percentage of votes received – 50%)] #NJWebinar
The efficiency gap tests congressional maps for partisan gerrymandering by counting the number of votes each party wastes in an election to determine whether a party enjoyed a systematic advantage of converting votes into seats.
What cases are around the corner? Not redistricting, apparently. #SCOTUS sent gerrymandering cases from Maryland, Wisconsin, and North Carolina back to lower courts rather than dismissing them outright #NJWebinar

Supreme Court justices’ tenure has increased in length, while fewer tenures end in death, another development that impacts the structure of the Supreme Court. #NJWebinar
In 1789, the average SCOTUS justice lived to 67 years. Now, the average justice lives an additional 15 years. As their lifespans increase, so too do their terms on the Court. #NJWebinar
Supreme Court confirmation hearings have become longer, and senators and nominees speak more than they did in the past, suggesting that the process has become more partisan. #NJWebinar

PACs are playing an ever-increasing role in American politics and raise an ever-increasing amount of donations. #NJWebinar https://t.co/d89bCq5h2h
It is important to publicize your PAC's goals to promote confidence and engagement amongst stakeholders. #NJWebinar
Using data is important means of communicating the clear outcomes of your PAC to potential contributors. #NJWebinar
PACs should set aspirational dollar or participation goals, but there are drawbacks to both approaches. #NJWebinar
Integrate PAC information outside of PAC-specific events, vary your messengers, and encourage your high-profile leadership to increase engagement. #NJWebinar
Communicate early and often about the value of your PAC, clarify common misconceptions about it, and be transparent about how contributions are spent. #NJWebinar
There are many stages of a PAC’s successful “ask” for contributions. In the first stage, consider your narrative. Second, cultivate awareness about your PAC through broad education. Finally, communicate constantly throughout the donor lifecycle.
Here some ways PACs can grow and sustain engagement at all stages of their work. #NJWebinar. https://t.co/hcMa5p1n3Q
According to our research, interviews and analysis, PACs face many challenges such as: widespread myths and misconceptions about PACs, perceived lack of enthusiasm from leadership, underestimation of impact of PAC contributions, and limited exposure to PACs. #NJWebinar

While availability of energy sources is important, the energy grid's vulnerability is a more pressing problem. Therefore, strengthening the physical elements of the energy grid is most helpful in defending against natural disasters. #NJWebinar
If Democrats do take back the House of Representatives, they may initiate the creation of a carbon tax, although it would be unlikely to pass through the Senate. #NJWebinar
Natural gas is surpassing coal and nuclear in energy generation, driving policymakers to focus on its production. #NJWebinar
The Trump administration has unsuccessfully attempted to pass a financial bail out plan for struggling coal and nuclear plants several times. #NJWebinar
The US may sanction states that attempt cyberattacks against the American electrical grid, but the government is largely unprepared to prevent these attacks. #NJWebinar
How can we build resilience in the electricity grid? #NJWebinar	1. Invest in smart grid tech	2. Raise sea walls and trim trees to protect the physical parts of the grid	3. Diversify fuel types	4. Create a more responsive feedback system for consumers
Hurricanes are expected to get stronger and more destructive, posing a more pressing threat to the aging electricity grid. #NJWebinar
Hurricanes Irma and Maria greatly affected Puerto Rican electricity sales in the commercial, industrial, and residential sectors. They did not reach pre-hurricane levels until May 2018, almost nine months after. #NJWebinar
70% of the 2.7 million miles of power lines in the U.S. are over 25 years old. #NJWebinar
Hurricane Florence may be one of the costliest hurricanes to hit the U.S. https://t.co/2cj2Z5BJZ6
The energy grid is resistant to cyberattacks through the help of built-in redundancies and regional variations. #NJWebinar
In 2015, Russian hackers successfully caused the loss of power in various parts of Kiev, Ukraine. This points to their ability to exploit vulnerabilities in the American electricity grid in the future.  #NJWebinar
The energy grid has vulnerabilities: cybersecurity and security of the physical elements of the grid. #NJWebinar
California is the leader in energy storage development, with 198 US grid-connected energy storage projects by state in 2016. This is due in large part to a program that provides incentives for customers to install storage in their homes and businesses. #NJWebinar
Energy storage technologies including battery energy storage, pumped hydroelectric storage, and thermal storage are prevalent in the U.S. #NJWebinar
Hawaii aims to generate 100% of its needed electricity through renewable sources by 2045, while California aims for 50% by 2030, and Vermont for 75% by 2032. #NJWebinar
Hawaii, California, Vermont and New York have the most 	ambitious renewable portfolio standards, meaning they have set the highest goals for generating renewable energy in the future. #NJWebinar
Renewable energy could provide 80% of U.S. electricity by 2050. #NJWebinar
Biomass uses combustion to create energy and, as a result, it produces carbon dioxide. #NJWebinar
The most prevalent renewable energy source in the west is hydroelectricity, while biomass is most common in the east. #NJWebinar
The Great Plains and Midwest have the highest onshore wind potential. The map below documents each region’s wind speed. #NJWebinar https://t.co/mikeU302VP
Hydroelectricity is one of the oldest form of renewable energy. It accounts for 7% of all energy generation in the United States. #NJWebinar
The decline in coal emissions (down 14% since 2005) is also attributed to lower electricity sales in the commercial and residential sectors due to milder weather. #NJWebinar
On the west coast, hydroelectric sources of electricity generation is most prevalent, while the midwest mostly uses wind. See a state-by-state breakdown below. #NJWebinar https://t.co/lINIHqsuGo
Energy-related carbon emissions fell about 1% in 2017, largely attributed to the decrease in emissions from the coal industry. #NJWebinar
Renewable energy investment, grid infrastructure innovation, and carbon emissions decrease are just some of the most popular trends in the power sector. #NJWebinar
The US produced 87.6 quadrillion Btus of energy in 2017, with 70% of production by fossil fuels. #NJWebinar
These seven wholesale markets dominate U.S. energy sales. #NJWebinar https://t.co/zV1qNNDQkf
All of North America is one electrical grid, overseen by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. The grid is split first into four large interconnections and further into regional reliability councils. #NJWebinar https://t.co/ahNSCcH5U6
The industrial sector generates and uses nearly all “direct use” electricity, which is both produced and used by the consumer. #NJWebinar
The residential sector consumes the most energy, with cooling accounting for the largest share of energy use. #NJWebinar
Higher voltage energy is more efficient and less expensive, however lower voltage is safer for homes and buildings. #NJWebinar
During production, energy is generated, sold, and purchased by energy companies and utilities. When electricity is generated, it’s transmitted to the electric grid. #NJWebinar
The electrical grid is composed of three main actions: production, transmission, and consumption. #NJWebinar
The electrical grid transports electricity from generating facilities to consumers. The grid includes power plants, power lines, and the transformers that adjust voltage along the way. #NJWebinar
In this #NJWebinar, our analysts will cover key movement in #renewableenergy and energy storage, as well as broader changes in the legislative landscape.
Our webinar, The Changing Energy Grid, is starting now. Follow along here to learn more about trends and changes in the American electricity landscape. #NJWebinar

Our analysts are answering your #PAC questions during the last portion of our #NJWebinar.
In #PA, outside groups helped #Saccone outspend #Lamb, even though Lamb raised three times as much for his campaign. #NJWebinar
Super PACs and party committees spent almost $13 million on the PA-18 special election. #NJWebinar
Some candidates rely on their own wealth to support their campaigns, as shown in this slide from our #NJWebinar: https://t.co/QQfji2GLFV
Regardless of 2018 outcome, many committee chairs will change hands due to nine retiring and two term-limited chairs. #NJWebinar
The powerful Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce Committees draw large PAC donations for their chairs. #NJWebinar
In 2016, the top 25% of donors gave 93% of all funds, while small donors accounted for less than 0.4%. #NJWebinar
In 1980, the top 25% of donors accounted for around 58% of individual funds, while small donors contributed about 10%. #NJWebinar
In 2000, around 74,000 individuals accounted for half of all campaign contributions; in 2016, about 16,000 did. #NJWebinar
When it comes to donors, just under 66,000 people donated to candidate campaigns in 1982. In 2016, around 3.2M did – an increase of 487%. #NJWebinar
Super PACs: Key facts and figures from our #NJWebinar https://t.co/wfCEHMJady
Between 2008 and 2016, non-candidate spending more than doubled: from $2.1B to $4.3B, driven by super PAC spending. #NJWebinar
There has been a sharp rise in non-candidate spending compared to that of candidates, particularly since the advent of super PACs. #NJWebinar
We’re comparing presidential and congressional campaign spending during our #NJWebinar. https://t.co/oxhFejwZbz
The poll also found that 84% of those surveyed think money has too much influence. #NJWebinar
In the same poll, 54% do not consider money given to political candidates to be a form of free speech protected by the First Amendment. #NJWebinar
In a New York Times/CBS News poll from May 2015, 66% believed that wealthy Americans have more of a chance to influence the election process than other Americans. #NJWebinar
Regardless of party affiliation, there is widespread concern among Americans about the role of money in US politics. #NJWebinar
In McCutcheon v. FEC (2014), the Supreme Court struck down aggregate contribution limits for individual donations to federal candidates, parties and political action committees combined. #NJWebinar
In Citizens United v. FEC in 2010, the Supreme Court held that the government cannot restrict the spending of corporations, unions and other groups for political campaigns. #NJWebinar
Shifting gears, we’re walking through a timeline of laws and Supreme Court decisions relating to campaign finance during our #NJWebinar.
In #Connecticut, the threshold for mandatory reporting dropped from $250,000 to $1,000. #NJWebinar
#Maine requires that political groups created to support or defeat ballot measures be subject to state campaign finance law. #NJWebinar
#SouthDakota requires primary-period disclosure from candidates running unopposed. #NJWebinar
#NewHampshire now requires governors to disclose the source of their contributions to inauguration events. #NJWebinar
#Colorado recently updated regulations to include candidates running for school board. #NJWebinar
Regulations in CO, NH, SD, ME, and CT are changing campaign finance norms. #NJWebinar
When choosing a donation recipient, individuals should consider where their money will align best with their goals. From $10-$100,000, our analysts break down suggested donation scenarios. #NJWebinar
Different types of political fundraising groups have different regulations. Here are a few covered in our #NJWebinar: https://t.co/1r7UvZYVLR
Super PACs are blurring the lines with campaigns. #NJWebinar https://t.co/wfcmSnhFeR
Super PACs can accept unlimited contributions and spend an unlimited amount supporting or opposing federal election candidates, but they cannot directly donate to federal candidates or parties. #NJWebinar https://t.co/ihIfrRFA2g
We’ve been mentioning “super PACs” -- how are they different from PACs? Our PAC 101 #NJWebinar explains.
PACs can contribute to political parties and other PACs, but an association may not solicit other PACs for contributions or vice versa. #NJWebinar
After six months, if a PAC has received contributions from 51 people, and given to 5 candidates, it can give candidates up to $5,000 per election. #NJWebinar
PACs are required to deposit checks and file reports with the FEC on a regular basis in a timely manner. #NJWebinar
When it comes to monetary contributions, PACs connected to an association can only solicit donations from individuals associated with the PAC, or connected or sponsoring organizations of the PAC. #NJWebinar
Super PACs can raise unlimited funds but cannot coordinate with federal candidates. #NJWebinar
#PACs must be funded with voluntary contributions of up to $5,000 a year (unless it is a super PAC). #NJWebinar
How do you start a #PAC? Our #NJWebinar explains in three steps: https://t.co/ulKm6t211O
We’re outlining the two main types of PACs during our #NJWebinar: Separate Segregated Funds (SSF), and Nonconnected Committees.
A #PAC is a political committee organized for the purpose of raising and spending money to elect and defeat candidates. #NJWebinar
NJ analyst Madelaine Pisani outlines the ways to donate in politics. They include candidate committees, party committees, and non-profits. Each have their own regulations, explained during our #NJWebinar.
Source restrictions prohibit certain individuals or entities from engaging in campaign activity. Only US citizens or permanent resident aliens are permitted to make contributions or election-related expenditures. #NJWebinar
Reporting and disclosure rules require groups that hit spending thresholds to register with the FEC and publicly disclose contributions and expenditures. #NJWebinar
Contribution limits restrict the size of contributions made to candidates, PACs, and political parties. #NJWebinar
Rules about campaign finance stem from three main focal points: Contribution limits, reporting and disclosure, and source restrictions. #NJWebinar
Topics for discussion will include the US campaign finance system, the role of #PACs and #superPACs, trends in fundraising as we head into the 2018 midterms, and what else to expect moving forward. #NJWebinar
Starting now: We’ll cover the rules and regulations for political advocacy groups in today’s webinar. Follow along using #NJWebinar.

Thanks for tuning in to this #NJwebinar. We'll be back next month for "Immigration Reform Under the Trump Administration."
However, it's important to note that #cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous, not anonymous.
One #NJwebinar viewer inquired about #cryptocurrency's use by criminals. It's a legitimate concern. "Criminals tend to be early adopters of new technology," Alistair says. "Especially when it enables them to evade law enforcement."
Just as we couldn't imagine the impact of the internet at its birth, the potential of #blockchain is still unknown. It could grow to be just as influential—or more. #NJwebinar
One challenge to widespread adoption of #blockchain is the need for lots of computing power. #NJwebinar https://t.co/sVuBXzS7Na
The next major application for #blockchain: smart contracts. #NJwebinar https://t.co/8Nf8fDk74B
#Blockchain's revolutionary benefit is the elimination of the need for trust in transactions, thereby removing the need for third-party intermediaries like banks. #NJwebinar https://t.co/zNCJWMhav6
The first purchase using #bitcoin occurred in 2010, when someone bought two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins (now worth about $100 million). "I certainly hope they were good," opines National Journal's Alistair Taylor.
Blockchain started with #Bitcoin, but it's so much more than that, and its many applications are still being discovered. #NJwebinar https://t.co/RwBvZXtcx9

“Network science starts with good strategy,” says @LukeHartig. #NJinsights
Network science is at the center of counterterrorism, and the same methodology can be applied to reaching hard-to-reach people in Washington. #NJinsights
At its core, network science is understanding people and their organizations, and understanding the connections between them. “It really gets exciting when you apply network science to human networks,” explains Hartig. #NJinsights
National Journal's @LukeHartig takes the stage to discuss network science, describing it as an analytically-rigorous approach to stakeholder mapping. #NJinsights
"AI/ML is the future," says Frederick. #NJinsights
"A positive trend has been universities doing more to create paths into higher education for students who come in through non-traditional paths, and paying more attention to socioeconomic and class diversity in their student populations," explains Felten. #NJinsights
Based on the state of knowledge now, we cannot confidently answer what industries (and to what extent those industries) will be most affected by automation. #NJinsights
Our panelists explain that no job can be fully automated. "There’s a big impact, but it’s way more nuanced and complicated than a simple clickable headline." #NJinsights
“The answer to how much automation will affect jobs is often misunderstood or misquoted,” explains Edwards. #NJinsights

The data that exists in the world is full of our own bias. “Our own human experience defines a flower as more pleasant than a bee,” says Edwards. #NJinsights

@Sen_JoeManchin @SenatorHeitkamp @SenDonnelly The GOP will likely try to bring these Democrats on board for #TaxReform, as Trump is popular in their states.

Conflict is the most important element in any story – the other four either build to or off of the conflict. https://t.co/ktO3rk8kGw https://t.co/I3AdKKf7uz
Telling a story doesn’t need to be complicated. All it takes is these five key components: https://t.co/ktO3rk8kGw

Without the intellectual foundation of white papers to build on, you’re just window dressing, says Lockwood. #NJEvents @LegendDigital
"You can broaden awareness with these new digital approaches, but you can never replace traditional methods." #NJEvents
"You’ll always have technocrats, academics, and practitioners who will want to get into the details white papers provide." #NJEvents
Our panelists discuss the future of the white paper. Will they ever be fully replaced? #NJEvents
"If you're enhancing the story with emotion, you're good. If you're replacing the story with emotion, you've gone too far." #NJEvents
Your story has to have an emotion piece and a data piece. But how much emotion is too much? @Cliff_Johnson asks. #NJEvents
Stories play to our emotions, and emotions drive our actions. In advocacy, emotion built on a foundation of data is what prompts decisions. https://t.co/xEp0kb00uE
"Maps are fantastic in the policy space,” says Lockwood. With tools like @Mapbox, maps can tell stories. #NJEvents @LegendDigital
Make friends with a reporter/traditional media. "That’ll get your message out to a lot more people than you think." @georgebthird #NJEvents
Concept illustrations are an underrated way to share a message, says @georgebthird. "They’ll grab peoples’ eyes." #NJEvents
Interactive infographics can draw a low of attention to your message without breaking the bank, says Lockwood. #NJEvents
"You have to start with a great policy idea. Once you have an idea, there’s a solution for you," says Lockwood. @LegendDigital #NJEvents
Not everyone has a large staff or a six-figure budget. "If you’re a small-budget org, where do you start?" @Cliff_Johnson asks. #NJEvents
To get the results you need from an advocacy perspective, your story needs an emotional element. #NJEvents
"Every project should have two pieces." Logic and emotion. Emotion leads to action. #NJEvents
“Start with the audience." Pick a story that fits with your political message, that will also be compelling to the audience. #NJEvents
"Chop up your content for the audience’s palate,” says @georgebthird. Tailor your story depending on who you’re trying to reach. #NJEvents
Our research shows that 50% of hill staff learn about issues by first turning to digital media. Are you telling compelling digital stories?

How do you turn a 50-75 page white paper into a compelling video without sacrificing the integrity of your policy message? #NJEvents
To turn policy papers into compelling digital content, using more graphics and less text is a good place to start. #NJEvents https://t.co/vKdbA63Ugu
If your content isn't digital and accessible, you risk not being a part of a Hill staffer's decision journey, says @Cliff_Johnson #NJEvents
