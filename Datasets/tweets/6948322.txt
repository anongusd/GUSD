@RyanWoodDFW @Starbucks The best explanation I‚Äôve gotten is that is that corporate/supply chain overlords are limiting how much of a product individual stores can order, thus leading to shortages. Begs the question of ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù
Has anyone else noticed @Starbucks stores as of late tend to run out of seemingly common items? Protein boxes, dark roast coffee, etc. Supply chain issue, perhaps? And yes, this is a first world problem.
