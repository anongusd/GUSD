@lourdesgnavarro Finally he was able to reach him and ask why: "He [wants] to be with his father. Just to enjoy a little bit being with his dad." 	Now, he doesn't know what to do w/ himself or w/ his son. Last week, Trump announced restrictions on getting asylum at the border.
@lourdesgnavarro He was thinking he might risk going back to Honduras and finally be with his boy -- but then he got a shocking call from his sister: his son had joined one of the migrant caravans headed to the U.S.
@lourdesgnavarro Meanwhile, in Honduras, his son had a hard life: with his mother gone, he went to live with his grandparents. His grandpa died, then his grandma. He went to live with an uncle. That uncle died too.
@lourdesgnavarro For the past 26 years, he has worked and lived in America. But earlier this year, the Trump administration announced it will end TPS for Hondurans. "You don't know what to do. You don't know what's going to happen. It feels very difficult," he told us.
@lourdesgnavarro After Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America in the late 1990s, the Clinton Administration granted Temporary Protected Status to qualifying people from those countries living illegally in the U.S - including our Honduran migrant.
@lourdesgnavarro His wife's journey to the States took a tragic turn. In Mexico, her boat capsized. Dozens died, including his wife. Her body was never found.
@lourdesgnavarro Back in Honduras, his wife gave birth to son, and left him with his grandmother while she set off to follow her husband to America. They dreamed of sending for their kid later.
@lourdesgnavarro In 1992, he was a poor campesino, a rural worker, living in Honduras. There were few opportunities and a lot of corruption and crime, so he headed north. The road was long, but he made it across the U.S.-Mexico border and started a new life in Florida.
On the show this morning, @lourdesgnavarro tells this story of one man caught at the intersection of President Trump's many immigration policies (we're not using his name for his protection):

@DonGonyea More from Russel: "The challenge the Trump Administration faces with beginning with a leader-level summit - the absolute apex of diplomacy... is that if that doesn't work, what will?"
@DonGonyea Says Russel, "I'd keep the champagne corked for the moment, but let's put it in the refrigerator. Everybody hopes that a summit meeting... might produce a breakthrough... and culminate in denuclearization. But I think it's an extreme longshot."
