@Godsoldier911 @chefstephnj @cmclymer Ha not debating whether Naomi was going to win - she was going to win.
@Godsoldier911 @chefstephnj @cmclymer I don’t think requesting the apology was out of line or abusive. I still think the third violation was overly punitive. Agree to disagree.
@Godsoldier911 @chefstephnj @cmclymer We’re not debating the racket break - that was an obvious code violation. The third violation was for calling the ump a thief - not for yelling at him three times.
@Godsoldier911 @chefstephnj @cmclymer What is unfair is any time a man breaks the “verbal abuse” or “gamesmanship” rules and is not also given a code violation. Her point was men have said much worse and not been penalized. I still believe the third violation was overly punitive.
@saucybrahmin @cmclymer So we should be giving code violations out to every men’s player for yelling at an ump? Yes? They’re being divas too then. Consistent treatment is different than special treatment.
@Godsoldier911 @cmclymer I agree athletes shouldn’t sass out officials, but I don’t see men being penalized in a similar manner. I think we can agree to disagree about the 3rd violation. The worst thing about this - Naomi’s win feels tainted. She played a hell of a game. Excited to see how far she goes!
@saucybrahmin @cmclymer Standing up for yourself is being a diva 🤔?
@Godsoldier911 @cmclymer You’re right - it is a double standard on the third code violation. Men 👏🏼say 👏🏼much 👏🏼worse!
