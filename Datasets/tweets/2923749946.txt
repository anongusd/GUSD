democrats don't make any sense to me. there's nothing liberal about the 2-party system.
and i stopped watching SNL in 2005
i was never into democrats. i identified as a republican when i was a kid and then went straight to the green party #mckinney2008
the audience at the democrat convention sounds like the audience on a show like SNL

@lmatsakis yeah and in the picture they're all sitting in their deep fryers
@lmatsakis they look like delicious donuts and/or really ineffective hairties
capital i's and lowercase L's looking the same in many fonts is one of my least favorite things about the alphabet
47 years since Apollo 11 and still no moon colonies.

I can get used to a lot of technological advances but phone service / internet access in the Lincoln Tunnel is still weird to me
@SovyStekla I hate making food for myself to eat by myself. too much effort for a few minutes of eating
@dadhater420 all the old 50s tv shows and movies have the couples sleeping in separate beds. my grandparents slept that way too

@fuzzgoddess btw even though i'm generally read as male online and in person i'm nonbinary
@fuzzgoddess all issues tie back to transmisogyny
@fuzzgoddess you cant write off violence just because it happens to sex workers. &amp; i was also referring to trans suicide rates.
@fuzzgoddess  it's sentiments  like this that perpetuate the culture of violence against trans women who don't conform to cis standards
