This brazen attack on law enforcement showcases the danger an unsecured border poses to Americans across our nation, not just at border. God bless law enforcement men &amp; women who defend our homes, families and communities. They are as much at risk by an unsecure border as anyone.
Why do law enforcement agents across the US want to ensure we know who is crossing our border? This brave Sherriff’s Deputy survived an attack on her life by a twice-deported illegal immigrant during a routine traffic stop HUNDREDS of miles from the border!https://t.co/qx9o5bMX13

It’s simply inconsistent with American values. We must give a voice to those who cannot yet speak for themselves – the unborn – and the fact that this enormous responsibility continues to be ignored is not only inhumane, it’s immoral.
Tomorrow we will ask again, but it is extremely disturbing that providing medical care to infants that survive an attempted abortion is not important enough to even allow a vote. These radical beliefs and blatant disregard for human life is not what Americans want or believe.

While its doubtful Democrats allow a spending bill addressing our growing national debt to move forward, I will continue advocating for responsible spending of taxpayer funds for as long as I am in Washington.

Over the decades, the SNAP program’s true purpose has been heavily abused. With our thriving economy and historic-low unemployment, the American people now have more opportunity than ever before to be self-sufficient.
America will always lend a helping hand to its citizens who have fallen on difficult times – that was the purpose of our SNAP program when it was created. Its intention was to be a short-term hand up – not a permanent way of life.

“The border agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way way down.” This is a commonsense principal most Dems agreed with before @POTUS was elected. #buildthebarrier #SOTU

6) Revitalizing American space program: @POTUS has sought renewed mission for @NASA &amp; space program. @NASA_Johnson Space Center will play vital role in US reclaiming sole leadership in space exploration. We want to return to the moon - to stay - and go to Mars. @housesciencegop
5) Rebuilding American infrastructure: @POTUS wants to continue rebuilding infrastructure to move people &amp; goods. On @TransportGOP Cmte we want to work with Dems on highway bill, but some freshman Dems say no bill without unrelated climate change provisions. Let's be bipartisan!
4) Protecting American workers: strong workforce is crucial for continued economic growth. @GOP plan: empower individuals &amp; businesses to boost wages. We've sent msg we'll protect our trade interests. Dems push policies to hollow out workforce, increase federal dependence.
3) Healthcare &amp; prescriptions: @GOPHouse passed reforms last year to lower prescription drug prices for Americans needing medical care. Dems have refused to replace/improve Obamacare even as healthcare costs ⬆️ &amp; options ⬇️. Will #SOTU present next steps? Dems, come to the table!
2) National security: @POTUS is pursuing foreign policy that protects Americans and our interests 1st &amp; foremost. How will we continue pursuing our long-term interests while honoring commitments &amp; protecting allies? We've made progress in Afghanistan, Venezuela &amp; North Korea.
1) Border security &amp; immigration: This affects every congressional district in the US - critically important! We need immigration policies that benefit American people's interest. It all starts with securing border. @POTUS has been willing to compromise but so far Dems have not.
I'm excited @POTUS will speak about "Choosing Greatness" in tonight's #SOTU. Our economy is strong, but we can do so much more if we decide to come together and advance an agenda in the best interests of the American people. Here are some issues I hope to see him address tonight:

Why is the U.S. Senate trying to bailout Obamacare health plans – including some that just gave employees $1,000 bonuses and have record profits? They don’t need a taxpayer bailout. https://t.co/WP0tfQDZDn
Community Health Centers are vitally important to many of our communities. It was a pleasure to visit today with Steven Racciato, Maggie Estrada, and Eisha Jones representing Health Center of Southeast Texas to hear about the care they’re providing for those who need it most. https://t.co/i8KkHNCjlh
I welcome steps taken by @POTUS to sanction Russia in aftermath of acts of mischief, aggression, cyber attacks &amp; attempt to influence US elections. We must stand w/ Britain &amp; other allies to make sure those engaged in these actions are brought to justice. https://t.co/moQdqmttIv
Criminal aliens should NOT be allowed to hide from law enforcement in illegal sanctuary cities. I’m proud of the 5th Circuit Court's decision to allow TX to continue cracking down on sanctuary cities. The safety of Texans &amp; U.S. citizens should come FIRST. https://t.co/EPAYjEpkfZ
Former VP Dick Cheney joined us at last night’s National Security Intelligence Forum to discuss vital NatSec challenges.

I commend fellow #Texan Rex Tillerson on his success as SecState, including talks to denuclearize NK. He’s a patriot &amp; served us well. Also, I applaud @POTUS’s choice of @MikePompeo_ . In Congress, he led on nat. security. He will serve well as our new SecState.
We are all saddened to hear about the #ChannelviewHS band bus crash in South #Alabama earlier today.

There were warning signs for years about the FL shooter. Those who could've prevented it ignored signals: multiple calls to @FBI, dozens to local police, run-ins w/ school officials &amp; warnings from parents &amp; neighbors. The real issue here is why were these dots never connected? https://t.co/w3wMnq4Xbg
Big companies like Apple &amp; Disney aren’t the only ones benefitting from #TaxReform. Hundreds of small businesses across the US have been able to give employee bonuses, provide raises &amp; expand their businesses creating more jobs &amp; continued economic growth. https://t.co/4VhphVAvPz

I commend #SupremeCourt for stopping this unlawful #CleanPowerPlan &amp; blocking another blatant #EPA overreach. https://t.co/CcNhnLLn2M
Obama's #CleanPowerPlan will eliminate thousands of jobs &amp; raise electricity bills for millions – particularly in TX https://t.co/CcNhnLLn2M
#EPA #CleanPowerPlan is an unworkable #CapAndTrade energy scheme that unlawfully circumvents Congressional authority https://t.co/CcNhnLLn2M

I had the very special privilege today of leading the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. https://t.co/xKYmhTIXkA
It’s past time we balance the budget and end Washington's addiction to spending money that it does not have. https://t.co/1umHmie3MA
Even under Obama’s standards, this is an extremely radical budget that fortunately has no chance of becoming law. https://t.co/1umHmie3MA
This is not a serious proposal. Nothing more than an a liberal wish list that solidifies Obama legacy of record debt https://t.co/dIPfOBpw7f
