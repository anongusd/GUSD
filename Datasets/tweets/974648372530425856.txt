@mommakay425 @BrokeArtiist @AP You get raped and are pregnant I can understand the abortion. Pos father gets you pregnant. Abort it. Doctor says the baby has some weird issue that's going to kill it and probably you during pregnant. Abort it. You weren't ready? Tough shit. You graduate in 2 years? Tough shit.
@mommakay425 @BrokeArtiist @AP Tell me where I said that lol no babies are the most important part of this issue. We need to stop killing them because men and women can't be responsible adults.
@davidgaliel @AP That's a natural issue with child birth when you don't have modern medicine and technology bud. Men handled everything for their women in the courts if necessary. They were REAL men who did everything outside while their women maintained their home and children. The natural way.
@davidgaliel @AP Only so many characters we're allowed to reply with. Grammar isn't very import on Twitter for that reason.
@davidgaliel @AP Less than 2% practiced slavery mostly Jews and a few blacks and whites. Women were home caring for the family while the men earned their way. Today men and women hate the idea of family so much they abort their unborn because hollywood and msm sells it as normalcy. Which is worse
@EastCoast_Dude1 @BrokeArtiist @AP Not saying it isn't a natural part of life. But Hollywood makes it look like it's just some nonchalant activity like making a cup of coffee. Yes we all are supposed to have sex but not the way kids are today and demanding abortions when they get that unexpected pregnancy
@BrokeArtiist @AP You demand cheap birth control like there's some magical kingdom where it comes from where it's safe and guaranteed to work and cost effective. That's not reality. It costs what it costs based on the market supply and demand just like any other commodity. Have safer smarter sex?
@EdKrassen @RemoveHIM @realDonaldTrump *willing to take significantly lower wages than Americans so they can escape #shithole countries
@EdKrassen @RemoveHIM @realDonaldTrump You're such an ignorant turd
@CountDankulaTV What's your story pal
@TRobinsonNewEra Count Dankula sounds like it will suck the plans right out of you and you're stuck on the couch all day.
School #shooter shot dead by resource officer in #Maryland today. How long until the left uses this to push for ban on #ar15s?
@langourdivan @BrokeArtiist @AP It's not proven. People can argue all day for eternity. There's no proof of either side. I look at people like you the exact same way I look at diehard religious fanatics.
@langourdivan @BrokeArtiist @AP How are you going to give people free birth control? Please tell me who is paying for it if it's a free government handout? That's what I'm talking about. Not abortions. Definitely not gonna pay for them either anymore after Planned parenthood lost their taxpayer funding.
@langourdivan @BrokeArtiist @AP Long term effects of birth control seems to be horrid cramps and infertility. Too many women In their 30s trying to have kids after 15 years of birth control and perfect planning sadly being let down by reproductive systems destroyed by birth control.
@langourdivan @BrokeArtiist @AP That's debatable with the monkeys. Sex is definitely a craving humans have. Do it safely on your own. The idea that we should pay for other people's lack of self control is absurd. Wrap it up, pull out, do what it takes! It's not other people's financial responsibility though.
@mvanvol_van @AP I'm not religious. The churches aren't guilt free either. Hollywood is the worst though without contest.
@TheRynheart @realDonaldTrump Keep using Reddit and other liberal corporations to support your anti American hatred
@TheRynheart @realDonaldTrump You're ignorant. Mainstream media as well as all social media was on the anti Trump train and @realDonaldTrump STILL WON
@Trav_Fowler When did they draw the map?
@Trav_Fowler The way I'm reading is is that they refused to block the redrawing of the maps. So they're going to he redrawn to support the democrats. Why are we redrawing them if they're clearly going to help out one side or the other?
@CBSNews @CBSThisMorning Pathetic. Destroying our own history. It's HISTORY. They're destroying these statues so when we are enslaved our great great grandchildren who have only had time to learn the 783 genders in their first 12 years of schooling will have no idea they are even slaves.
@Trav_Fowler Exactly. They allowed democrats to redraw lines so they can win certain counties. It's a disgusting perversion of what our democracy should be!
@infowars They're gonna hit your office. Multiple attacks in Austin? Warning?
@ABC @realDonaldTrump was warned by democrats what would happen if he kept doing what Americans wanted. Since then there's been bombings and shootings every week. ü§îü§îü§î
@justinfuqqs These people are mentally ill. No logic or reasoning skills at all. Once you're pregnant there's another body growing inside of you. It was made from the male sperm and female egg. It's a life form. Living breathing human. If you don't want the responsibility, don't have sex.
@MSunny28 @justinfuqqs There's someone else body growing inside the uterus. Ignorant quotes like this have destroyed the minds of many. It's not just your body anymore after you get impregnated. There's another male or female body. You shouldn't have the right to kill it because you're irresponsible.
@JessLevine111 @AP Soy face liberals were almost the death of this country. Not anymore! Trump and the remaining free thinkers stepped in before Hillary could kill this nation off like an aborted baby.
@JessLevine111 @AP Life of the party actually. Just because I'm responsible and don't want to kill an unborn living baby because I couldn't control my sexual urges doesn't make me a party pooper. You look like you party hard on the regular though. Are your children properly being taken care of?
@holdyourbutts @AP Modern feminism has destroyed you. Women with class, beauty, character, and dignity are not on board the feminazi Gestapo train. Most of them, no matter their skin color are all aboard the #TrumpTrain because that's where life and prosperity goes to live. Modern femisim is death.
@davidgaliel @AP A time when men like you didn't even exist. Men were too busy being real men worrying about REAL life issues. Not worrying about how they can escape responsibility of being a father. Out looking to get an abortion because they screwed the ugly drunk girl after the bar closed.
@RethinkingEve @davidgaliel @AP I lived there when I was a kid and for over a year recently. This a crock of garbage lies. Women are a strong part of the southern community. They treat their women with respect. You want to attack a group who hates women go after the record labels who produce gangsta rap!
@SmokeShow173 @BrokeArtiist @AP Exactly my point! They show it in a light where there's never any respect or love involved. Usually just people cheating or finally bursting out into LUSTFUL screwing. Its made into a lightly taken thing. Then pro choice Hollywood wants to lecture us on how to treat women? #GTFOH
@BrokeArtiist @AP Having sex just to have sex with people you have no feelings for just for the sex is the issue. Sex is a deeply emotional and physical exchange. It's about a lot more than pleasure. There's consequences to sex and aborting living breathing babies shouldnt be an acceptable fix.
@holdyourbutts @AP #Hollywood sells sex as something that's just for fun do it whenever wherever you want without consequence. That ideology is subliminally etched into people's subconscious. It's a cancer to mankind. 		https://t.co/dga8hdzAdZ
@holdyourbutts @AP I'm not talking about divorce. And @realDonaldTrump was never attacked in the media until he ran against #globalist scumbags like @HillaryClinton. You abortion loving America hating liberal mongoloids are so brainwashed by the mainstream it's pathetic. Get thoughts of your own!
@francisKHAN @AP Sick world we live in.
@Cernovich @tedcruz @facebook I hope @facebook goes down along w the rest of these #AntiAmerican #Traitor tech giants.
@JessLevine111 @AP Love that this has already #triggered a bunch of leftists lunatic liberals devoid of morals.
@JessLevine111 @AP Doing great thanks. Looks like you need all help you can get.
@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump can't wait to see @Comey, @fbi mueller, and @HillaryClinton when they are indicted. Enjoy your free time while you can!
@AP Maybe if #sex wasn't used by #hollywood to make impressionable kids lust for sex instead of looking for the love in it, we wouldn't be having this discussion to begin with? At a certain point #abortion becomes #murder. To some that point is #conception üëåüëç#mississippi
@Cernovich Just #anthonyweiner
Our government was not created so that you can manipulate it to benefit your political agenda. It was created to benefit #thepeople and protect them from things like this. https://t.co/twPDioPi4l
@RealAlexJones @RealAlexJones this is old news. I heard this was coming on @infowars like 10 years ago!!!!!
@TIME I call bullshit. Where's Nicaragua and the rest of central America? Germany is on the list though üòÇ
@SkyNews @infowars @RealJamesWoods @realDonaldTrump this is why we can't allow people to abuse our #Immigration system. This is why we must have a wall. We must deny #islamic extremists entry and we must properly vett. #amtrak is already dangerous enough to have this going on in #america
@RealJamesWoods @marcorubio you would think this having your salary being paid for by tax dollars as well. Would be a shame if someone abusing public office didn't get to retire on public tax dollars wouldn't it? @realDonaldTrump @jeffsessions #Thankyou and thank you @RealJamesWoods
@justinfuqqs They had 5000 tons of LSD Acid Shrooms and opipoids basically shoved down their throats and were forced fed #liberal #communist propaganda at the same time. #MKUltra mind control willfully being done right in the open basically.
@MarcFaletti Have you been bathing in #soy?
@justinfuqqs And we have no film footage from a #lasvegas casino? I used to live there when I was a kid and I visited a handful of times. Casinos have just as many cameras as they do slot machines. This feels like #911Truth #pentagon #BS all over again.
@RickeyRat @nytimes @HillaryClinton @FBI You are probably one of the rats that are infesting #liberalcesspool #SanFrancisco sidewalks leaving your bodily fluids everywhere. Get off Twitter and clean your shit covered streets for your community instead or spreading #antiamerican #Propaganda
@RickeyRat @nytimes @HillaryClinton @FBI There is plenty of evidence in the #deletedemails that were recovered as well as the @wikileaks and @ClintonFdn to hang them. Gotta have people willing to work for America instead of @HillaryClinton to get the job done.
@RickeyRat @nytimes @HillaryClinton @FBI Clinton crime denier. When all of her protectors are ousted from their thrones see what happens. We all know the truth. Now we might finally be able to act without internal resistance and blatant obstruction.
@WSJ sells the idea that it is okay to not place importance on family bonding experiences while pushing #LGBT #Propaganda on us at the same time. It's almost like normal #family behavior is now taboo. @infowars @RealAlexJones @RogerStoneJr @allidoisowen @PrisonPlanet @TedNugent https://t.co/AUuFw2O3kp
@RickeyRat @nytimes @HillaryClinton Well now that @FBI #McCabe was #fired we will actually look into the @HillaryClinton crimes that #comey was covering up.
@nytimes Why don't you ever talk about REAL crimes? Like the ones @HillaryClinton has been committing for decades?
@PrisonPlanet @PrisonPlanet @RealAlexJones @allidoisowen tech and social media giants are #google #gaga for Orwellian control over society. The left is like a flesh eating disease. Eventually if not taken care of properly they will eat this nation alive. https://t.co/uFh7Boo9sG
@business @BV And you're worried about #AR15s when these are the real killers of our youth!!!! @infowars @RealAlexJones @NRA #2A #MAGA
@Cernovich These people are evil demons disguised as the meat robots they so wish to be. Stay vigilant America has your back! #maga
RT @AP: BREAKING: Florida transportation officials: Engineer called 2 days before bridge collapse to report cracking at 1 end of span.
@RealJamesWoods Putting American lives at risk to protect illegal immigrants. Very sad. Let them do their jobs our tax dollars pay them to do. They aren't arresting college students in mass. They're going after n	MS-13 type CRIMINALS
@HillaryClinton You won't be!
@IngrahamAngle Two days prior to retirement. No pension now! No more wasting tax payer dollars.

@RealAlexJones This would be a huge victory for America. We have to make this happen. @NancyPelosi is one of the biggest snakes in the globalist nest of vipers. She must go! #MAGA #DACA #BOOMSHAKALAKA
@PrisonPlanet Why do you think SCJ Ginsburgh asked to lower age of consent to TWELVE in the USA? These people running the show are pedophiles.
@IngrahamAngle I remember @ShepNewsTeam staring down his nose at @realDonaldTrump on election night. Who is the laughing stock now buddy?
@RealAlexJones I remember when @NFL told @RGIII he couldn't where his #Jesus shirt in 2014. 		https://t.co/cQ81eSR6bZ
