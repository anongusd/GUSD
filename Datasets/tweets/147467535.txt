Under the new rules, asylum seekers who cross the border between ports of entry will have to meet a higher standard than "credible fear" of returning home. They'll have to prove "reasonable fear" or prove they are protected under the Convention Against Torture

Trump's plans to restrict asylum and detain migrants until hearings are in violation of court rulings, US &amp; intl. law. My latest factcheck  https://t.co/IYbLpN9eHb
POTUS told @jeffmason1 it is legal to hold immigrants, said it was just a matter of facilities. But fact is they would run into a court ruling (Zadvydas) that puts a 6 month limit on adult migrants and Flores puts a 20 day limit on children.
Fact check: Trump did not continue an Obama-era law when his admin began separating children from parents. They separated when parents were being criminally charged, but they did not charge parents simply for crossing illegally. Trump did.

@TheToddSchulte Todd, let's talk this one out. Most of the asylum seekers are coming to the border without documents, so they can be both undocumented and asylum seekers. The numbers are rising compared to last year and the numbers I'm referring to are CBP's apprehensions of at and between POEs

Judge Sabraw appears ready to extend timeline for govt to reunify children under 5 as long as HHS can provide a list of children and the status of their parents
DOJ lawyer says: 16 children under 5 yo have not been matched to parents, 46 to parents in ICE custody, 19t to  parents deported, 19 to parents released into country, 2 to parents w/ criminal history
ACLU lawyer raises good point: How did ICE lose track of parents if they're supposed to be tracking illegal immigrants? After DOJ lawyer says there is no master list of parents separated or addresses of those released.
Judge Sabraw tells govt he did not intend for his order for reunification to dictate that ICE must release or must retain parents. Pushback against argument this week that his ruling is at odds with Flores.
UPDATE: Govt tells judge only half of the ~100 children under 5 separated from their parents will be reunified by July 10 deadline. 20 pct of parents have been released and their whereabouts largely unknown.

Also about 100 children separated from their parents and in HHS custody are under 5. Going on @mitchellreports now to break down the numbers
Also until now, the only children who have been reunified with their parents have been for joint family deportation. Going forward, to comply with court, they will detain them in ICE custody.
Big takeaways from HHS call: Nearly 3000 children in HHS custody making claims they have been separated (larger than 2300 previously reported and includes those separated pre- zero tolerance.)
HHS getting ready to do a call with reporters on updates for reuniting children with parents. I'll be asking: Is there any plan to reunite that doesn't require deportation?
