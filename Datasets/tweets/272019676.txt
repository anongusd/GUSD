The Army now has plans to modernize its vertical lift fleet, but transformational change will take a large investment.		If the Army were equal the Navy’s spending level, it would have to spend more than 1.9 times as much as the entire military spent on vertical lift this year.
With such a large fleet, the Army is very influential in shaping the vertical lift market.		However, despite having by far the largest vertical lift fleet, the Army ranked second in vertical lift spending (procurement and R&amp;D) each year for the past decade.
The size of the Army’s helicopter fleet, alone, would still give the United States the world’s largest air force, ahead of Russia.
The U.S. military spends more than $8 billion a year developing and buying new vertical lift aircraft (tiltrotors and helicopters).

The deployment pattern of NK missiles has evolved over time into three “belts”: the Tactical (or Forward), the Operational, and the Strategic (or Strategic Rear) based upon their physical distance from the DMZ. https://t.co/2Ed3kd6mty
North Korea’s missile program can trace its lineage to the mid-1960s, when it first acquired long-range artillery rockets. It gained short-range ballistic missile capabilities in 1986. By the 1990s, the KPA was constructing missile bases along the DMZ.
3. Almost always consist of a network of underground facilities for missile inventory, 4. They are not launch facilities, 5. They are not like other missile operating bases around the world.
A majority of KPA missile bases share these traits: 1. They are rudimentary and physically small, 2. Located in mountainous terrain and have one entrance point.
The task of identifying these missile bases is made difficult by the KPA’s aggressive camouflage, concealment, and deception (CCD) program as well as distinguishing between brigade-, regiment-, and battalion-sized units.
The Korean People’s Army Strategic Force—responsible for operating ballistic missiles—is both sizable and capable of inflicting significant damage even when its missiles are armed with only conventional warheads.
These missile bases can be used for all classes of ballistic missiles (including ICBMs), and presumably should have been identified in any final and fully verifiable denuclearization deal.

And across key migration related EU funds, humanitarian aid saw the biggest change https://t.co/h3sO4NWdt3
The EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, tackling the “root causes” of migration, has pooled €3.4 billion to date.
The German Foreign Office’s budget for humanitarian aid and crisis prevention quadrupled between 2014 and 2017, and in 2015 Chancellor Merkel pledged €8.3 billion for the 2016-2019 period for development cooperation efforts focused on the drivers of migration.
The EU's Asylum, Migration, and Integration Fund’s (AMIF) budget more than doubled between 2015 and 2016 to reach close to €2 billion.
In 2016 @Frontex underwent a structural overhaul and saw a 177% increase in funds from the previous year, along with a goal to double its staff by 2020. The EU Commission has also announced the goal of hiring up to 10,000 border guards in the next few years.

3. The presence of outside and non-state military forces —including Russia, Turkey, Iran, the United States, Hezbollah, Syrian Kurds, and others—will continue to pose an obstacle to stability in Syria and exacerbate ethnic and sectarian tensions.
2. Humanitarian and economic costs totaling an estimated $200-350 billion will require serious outside investment. A failure to address these conditions will almost certainly result in continued instability and a future relapse into civil war.
1. An estimated 70,000 opposition militants with legitimate grievances against the Assad regime are positioned for a low-level insurgency that could last for years to come.

Out-of-pocket health care expenses are a significant burden for some Chinese families. Between 2005 and 2015, China’s poverty gap widened at a rate greater than that of Thailand and South Africa due to these expenses. https://t.co/wui2wkeCKl https://t.co/Y93CRolAv1
3) The ban on travel by U.S. citizens to North Korea has been significant for organizations involved in humanitarian and educational engagement. U.S. citizens involved in English language, education, and agricultural programs have not been permitted to travel.
2) UN Security Council sanctions enforcement has been uneven. China allegedly stopped exports of certain medical equipment to North Korea due to small metal components, which could also be used in missile construction and would therefore be banned by sanctions.
1) North Korea is not seen a particularly sympathetic victim. Private non-government aid organizations in the United States have suffered significant declines in available funding because of negative publicity on North Korea’s hostile military intentions.
Global humanitarian engagement with North Korea has been difficult to carry out in the last decade. 		In a new CSIS commentary, Ambassador Robert King lists three current obstacles to humanitarian engagement:
North Korea is in critical need of humanitarian assistance. 		The country has one of the highest tuberculosis rates in the world. One-in-five children suffer from malnutrition. Half of children in rural areas do not have access to safe drinking water.  https://t.co/QsSZKYyWij
