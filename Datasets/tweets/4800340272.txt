Today the Trump administration announced sanctions on 5 Venezuelan officials tied to Former President Maduro‚Äôs regime.		This is a great step to help restore freedom &amp; democracy in #Venezuela. Maduro‚Äôs time is up along with his gang of thugs. It‚Äôs time to step aside!
I'll reserve judgment on any potential executive action by the President until I'm able to fully evaluate it, but as I‚Äôve said, I don't believe declaring a national emergency is the right approach. I'd also expect the President to stay within statutory and constitutional limits.
Yesterday I met yesterday with Board Members and Representatives of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) to discuss immigration reform and higher education reauthorization.
I, too, want stronger border security, including a wall in some areas. But how we do things matters. Over 1,000 pages dropped in the middle of the night and extraconstitutional executive actions are wrong, no matter which party does them.
I‚Äôm disappointed with both the massive, bloated, secretive bill that just passed and with the president‚Äôs intention to declare an emergency to build a wall.
With Democrats and Republicans locked in a staring contest over border security, there's a solution here that secures the border and won't cost the taxpayers one dime: Let's build a wall, and make El Chapo pay for it!
Our coal miners shouldn‚Äôt pay the price when coal companies go bankrupt. But once again, retired coal miners are having their healthcare &amp; pensions ripped away from them after years of backbreaking work. It‚Äôs past time Congress kept our promise &amp; passed the American Miners Act

WATCH TOMORROW: I‚Äôm urging my colleagues to support my bill, the American Miners Act, that will ensure that none of our coal miners or their beneficiaries would lose their healthcare, pension, or black lung benefits. It‚Äôs time to finish the job &amp; keep the promise to our miners.

Will soon file bill making immediate expensing permanent &amp; tax corporate buybacks same way as dividends. No tax advantage for buybacks over dividends. But we‚Äôre going to give permanent preference to investments that will drive the creation of jobs &amp; increase in wages. 	 	9/9
Right now don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúfree market‚Äù. We have tax code which engineers economy in favor of inflating prices of shares at the expense of future productivity &amp; job creation. If we are going to use tax code to incentivize behavior, it should be investing in productivity &amp; jobs 		8/9
The irony is many businesses,if they could make own choice, would rather reinvest profits in improving their product &amp; improving workers‚Äô skills than return it to shareholders. 		See the arguments of respected corporate attorneys like Martin Lipton: https://t.co/mGWKeokWBJ‚Ä¶	 7/9
I support free market over socialism b/c market better than govt at encouraging investment &amp; innovation needed for widespread prosperity. But tax code discourages best aspect of free market by giving buybacks a deferral advantage over dividends or investment	 	6/9
The argument buybacks are good because frees up $ to reinvest in other businesses growth isn‚Äôt backed up by the facts. 		Over last 40 years money back to shareholders has tripled as a % of our GDP, but investment into business dropped by 20%. 	 	5/9
This is evidenced by fact that over the last 4 years our largest corporations borrowed money in order to fund buybacks &amp; dividends. This money they borrowed did nothing to make company more profitable or productive. And they have to pay interest on the money!	 	4/9
Why are profits not being invested into company or new companies? Because our economy driven by large &amp; active investors who pressure for increase earnings per share.Investment pools that prefer safe returns over long term investment &amp; executive compensation based on stock 	3/9
Since 1980 have steady trend of corporate profits flowing back into financial markets &amp; less of these profits invested in increasing productivity through innovation, technology, equipment etc. The result is not enough increase in productivity, growth or widespread prosperity 2/9
The justification for corporate buybacks is company has no better investment available. This may be true for any company from time to time. But what does it say when it is true for many companies year after year? 1/9

Glad @POTUS signed the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act into law, a bill I cosponsored to provide back-pay to federal employees impacted by the gov. shutdown. As we work to find a path forward in Congress, these men &amp; women deserve whatever assurances we can provide them.
