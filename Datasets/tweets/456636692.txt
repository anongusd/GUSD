@BBPHredux @Mellecon But that doesn't make each proposition equally as probable, does it? For instance, you can't prove that I don't have an invisible unicorn living in my garden. So, are you undecided on whether you believe that or not, too?
@BBPHredux @Mellecon I'm saying opinions don't matter to the facts.
@BBPHredux @Mellecon Opinions don't matter, evidence does. Scientists can believe what they want, but it only becomes scientific when evidence is produced and it clears the peer review process.
@BBPHredux @Mellecon Science doesn't claim to be able to explain everything about life. If it did, it would have stopped. There is nothing in maths or any other discipline that points to a designer. That's just not true
@BBPHredux @Mellecon Then you don't believe in a god. You are an agnostic atheist who has mistakenly assumed atheism is a claim that god does not exist
@BBPHredux @Mellecon We can know a lot. For instance: there's no credible evidence for the existence of a god. Therefore there's no reason to believe a god exists. Essentially, the same with fairies, ghosts and Bigfoot
@BBPHredux @Mellecon No. I don't claim god doesn't exist. I claim that I don't believe in any god. It's an opt-out
@BBPHredux @Mellecon Not mutually exclusive. Nor does atheism require faith. Unless you think everything you don't believe in constitutes its own religious-like faith

@Ecstastee2000 I'm asking why It's a misrepresentation to say Robinson is racist for joking with slurs, but it's not a misrepresentation to say Sweeney is racist for joking with slurs. Yes, it's a misrepresentation to say joking is racist, right?
@SubBeck @godlesswifey @SamWhiteTky Yeah. And somehow the drunk driver got home fine. This is not an argument
@SubBeck @godlesswifey @SamWhiteTky The prison have denied it and I don't trust Robinson to tell the truth. So, here we are

@Stew_Pd Yeah. I'm not doubting this. I've been a victim of that myself. It's not illegal though. Do you understand? I can't take them to court for it, get it?
@Stew_Pd @RaheemKassam No. It won't. Raheem's was clearly a mistake, now reversed. Facebook have officially released a statement about Robinson. Robinson is not getting his account back.
@Ecstastee2000 What? I'm not fine with either. Only one of us is pretending one is a problem and the other isn't though. You chastise Sweeney for joking with racial slurs but dismiss it when Robinson does it. Why?  Because you're a hypocrite.
@TheMig29 Haha. Wow
@AnthonyJ_48 I really wasn't impressed with the Sweeney stuff either. Seemed like blatant misrepresentation. This feels like a massive pre-emptive strike because Panorama have something substantial on him.
@SamWhiteTky @SubBeck They don't need to be influenced. The defendants legal team only needs to make the case they could have been
@Ecstastee2000 Hahaha! Whose character am I assassinating? I'm asking you why you are able to dismiss Robinson's jokes with racial slurs but not Sweeney's. And you can't answer. Funny that
@Ecstastee2000 So...What was racist about Sweeney mocking his own Irish heritage then? Why is it ok for Robinson to 'banter' with racist slurs, but not Sweeney? This is your problem to deal with, not mine.
@Ecstastee2000 Haha! So, when Tommy does it, it's ok. Got it. You're a hypocrite. https://t.co/vS0duuoeQV
@Stew_Pd No. No we won't. Stew, do you think they are going to bin the law for this? You don't know what you are talking about. Facebook are not required to provide anyone with an account. Accept it
@Ecstastee2000 The sources are all hyperlinked in that article
@AnthonyJ_48 I thought it was embarrassing and incredibly weak. Nothing journalistic about it
@Stew_Pd No. No it won't. A UK judge can't compel Facebook (a private US company) to provide an account for Tommy Robinson. Can't happen.
@Stew_Pd What? I'm going to guess you're not a legal expert StewüòÉ. He can't legally compel Facebook to give him an account. Under any circumstances
@SubBeck Free speech rights &amp; protection of the judicial process are two separate things. Robinson can say whatever he wants about court cases. He just can't broadcast it to half a million people, from the court, whilst proceedings are active. Again, if that's unfair, make an argument
@Stew_Pd Where did I say that? I asked what legal recourse he has
@SubBeck I've no idea why going against laws that exist solely to prevent trials (child rape in this case) being prejudiced is the hill you want to die on. Again, it's much more probable jurors and witnesses could have been filmed too.
@SubBeck If you have a good argument as to why it should be a protected right to prejudice court proceedings, feel free to make it. I'm yet to hear one
@SubBeck Yeah, like I said. You don't understand our stronger legal system
@Stew_Pd No, I'm saying you have no legal right to a Facebook page. They are a private company.
@SubBeck No, it was pure chance. The defendants legal team even pushed for a retrial. It was denied because non of the jurors had seen the live feed, or witnesses had been caught on it on the way into court. I don't know why you are struggling to see the seriousness of this
@SubBeck But he didn't nearly break the law, he did break the law. If you don't think interfering with justice for rape victims isn't a big deal, I can't help you
@Ecstastee2000 Yeah, he's on video describing a taxi driver as "a little Paki that drives a car". I look forward to hearing how Robinson's racial slurs aren't enough to end his credibility, but Sweeney's are. https://t.co/G3bjDMRqLq
@SubBeck What's that got to do with it?
@SubBeck Yes, I think interfering in the justice process for child rape victims  (twice!) to the point where you nearly cause a mistrial is a huge problem. Not very strong?  These rules are in place to ensure a fair trial. That's the only way a justice system can be strong.
@SubBeck Yeah. Robinson did no work though
@SubBeck Amazing. It doesn't mean a thing that Robinson nearly caused the collapse of *several child rape trials*, just so he could film himself shouting abuse at defendants. That's insane
@SubBeck Like 'few others'? Are you kidding? Have you any idea how many journalists, solicitors &amp; social workers worked tirelessly to get this into the public and into the courts? What are you talking about? Robinson did nothing for has process. Zip
@SubBeck Because you don't know what contempt of court is
@SubBeck Yes, also known as blatant contempt of court
@SubBeck What are you trying to convince me of? That grooming gangs are a huge problem that were covered up? I already agree. Again. I'm saying Robinson played no part in them coming to light
@Stew_Pd What legal recourse does he have to a Facebook account?
@SubBeck I'm not saying he should have done anything more than he did. I'm saying he didn't expose grooming gangs. And in fact, he nearly caused the collapse of the justice process for the victims.

@Robfoulger48 @F1bratsdad Not always.
@mephistofish Correct. What's your point?
@SubBeck Not true. I'd argue Robinson talking about it made it more difficult to be discussed
@mephistofish Where you are coming from? I think we already agree on the disgusting cover-up of grooming gangs. I just don't agree Robinson played a part in exposing them

@mephistofish Yeah, this isn't 'exposing' anything. Hard working, brave journalists, care workers, lawyers and courageous victims exposed this. Robinson actually nearly caused the trials to collapse
@TheMig29 @nickmon1112 Yeah, it's my blog
@joelmcw Never said otherwise
Nicki, Robinson's defense was literally that he didn't say anything on that live stream that hadn't already been reported in the media. Haha. So..What's true? https://t.co/795Tkyhn0Q

@Ecstastee2000 Yes. Seriously. I do evidence, not conspiracies based on nothing more than a logical fallacy (post hoc ergo procter hoc). Besides, it makes zero sense. Robinson attacks the BBC, so...Facebook penalise him?
@Ecstastee2000 Because it's probably entirely unrelated.
@concretemilk This sounds to me like replacing the word 'infidel' with 'Muslim' in the Qur'an to make a point. Yeah, point proven it seems

Weird. Why is no one complaining about me using the The Daily Mail as a source this time? I'm on to you.
Tom, can you please explain how you could know so little about this issue that you would think being "anti-Islamist" is a bad thing? 		This blind spot from the left is why people like Robinson have such a large following. 		@tom_watson https://t.co/0vRjLmjQBr
@steviepattisond You don't have to use your real name. Do you have any examples of these violations?
@BioskoopReview Link?
@mknash_v2 @DEEEETOO @gmpolice @MCRMetrolink Yeah, I live in Manchester too. I can confirm
You may support this now because it's not you, or not someone who shares your worldview. But guess what? The climate can change. The politics and sensitivities of those in charge can and do shift. I'll need a cast iron example of calls for violence before I make my mind up
Anyone who has followed my content closely over the years will know that I'm a critic of Robinson's behaviour. I don't trust him as a source or value him as an authority. However, I'm just as uncomfortable with huge tech companies controlling the narrative for us all
This could well spell the end of Robinson's prominence. His entire 'brand' depends on a social media presence and an ability to organize events. In fact, the language of the statement from Facebook suggests anyone who promotes events for him is now subject to penalty too
Regardless of how much support Robinson has, Facebook was his main form of promotion. His posts and live videos got tens of thousands of views. The impact this will have on him can not be understated, such is the monopoly social media has on conversation and news
So, Facebook have released a statement.		The charges appear to be:		"Organized hate", "dehumanizing language" and "calls for violence targeted at Muslims".		The latter one seems the more serious, and least ambiguous. So, does anyone have any examples of this? https://t.co/NgOGQ30yvc
My default state is anti-ban. The problem with social media bans is that on the rare occasion you do get provided with a reason, you almost definitely never get an example of the specific violation...
Ok, in before some bore says "Facebook are a private company and can ban who they want". Yeah, we know. Got it. Can the rest of us discuss this implications and ethics of such a decision now? Good...so..

@moomin_pug 'Extremism'? Be more specific. The group was not a proscribed or illegal group when Maajid was in it. It became more extreme, and thus banned, after he left. How can it be a crime to support a perfectly legal, political organisation?
@moomin_pug I've asked you 2 fair questions, that if answered competently, would back your points. They are:		1. What crimes should Maajid be 'locked up' for? 		2. Which 'law-abiding Muslims' as he 'denounced'? 		If you can't answer those, then you have no argument &amp; the convo is done.
RT @GSpellchecker: @moomin_pug What crime?
@moomin_pug What crime?
@moomin_pug Where has he 'denounced Muslims', and for what? You know what worries me? Muslims who denounce pro-human rights, anti-extremist, pro-LGBT rights, pro-free speech, anti-Islamist, secular Muslims.

15. Werleman compared exMuslims to 'Nazis'. This is particularly unhinged given #ExMuslims have a shout for the most oppressed group on the planet.

@mumbogumshoe He has over 103, 000 Twitter followers.

6. "Not a real Muslim", "just in it for the money" etc. These are all claims Werleman himself has made about Islamic reformers. This rhetoric is indistinguishable from the far-right, anti-Muslim 'fascists' he claims to oppose.
5. So long as Werleman continues to denigrate and smear (see 'endanger') liberal Muslim voices (and ex-Muslims), he also gives the far-right excuses to ignore them too...
4. In fact, Maajid himself has heard from people who held these prejudicial views about Muslims until they heard him talk or saw his work. The truth is, it's people like Werleman that empower right-wing, Muslim hating fascists....
3. Maajid is one of the few courageous, outspoken voices who tackles both "far-right" extremism AND Islamic extremism. He operates an anti-extremist organisation. Maajid is actually a massive inconvenience to the Muslim-hating, far-right narrative because he contradicts it...
2. First thing to note is that the 'Muslim hating, right wing fascist' narrative is that "there's no such thing as a peaceful Muslim" or that "Muslims will not defend human rights/address the problems in Islam". Maajid is a secular, pro-human rights, anti-Islamist reformer...
1. Ok, time for a slight digression on Courtenay J Werleman. We'll get to his racism, plagiarism and lies in a moment. First of all, we'll deal with this appalling comment. The claim is that Maajid somehow empowers 'Muslim hating, right wing fascists'. This is nonsense... https://t.co/xnsxVMFoVF

Wait. What? A Scottish man is saying he is facing anti-Scottish 'hostility' when he visits a (unnamed) city in England. Who in England hates the Scots?! #bbctbq
I agree you &amp; other people think that, yes. However it's a different issue. It has nothing to do with defining yourself as European. Unless European countries not in the EU are somehow less European. The EU is a corporate entity, not a cultural identity https://t.co/1L9lZO8rU3
Young chap in the crowd who defined himself as 'European' is moaning that his "identity has been dissolved" because we are leaving the EU. He knows we're not actually leaving Europe, right? #bbctbq

Yes, now we can't be lynched or burned alive, we get to openly challenge terrible ideas. #bbctbq https://t.co/zAq3ghfrcf
The truth is, no level of anti-Catholicism is too much so long as the Catholic church still has power and is ruining lives. Catholicism is anti-humanity, and it's a duty to stand against it. #bbctbq
The chap from 'Catholic Voices' sets his sights on 'secularism' when asked how rife anti-Catholicism is. However, in a 'secular' society, he gets to sit there in a suit and say his bit. That favour was not returned when his guys were running the show.  #bbctbq
Loving the Indian girl with a thick Scottish accent. That's what integration sounds like. I mean, no one can tell what she's saying anymore, but still. #bbctbq
And, unfortunately, as we are currently seeing, this freedom also allows ancient, tribal squabbles to endure. #bbctbq
The Jewish gentleman making a great point about religious freedom in Britain. It's one of the best places in the world for allowing others to identify as British and with any faith. That's in slight contrast to the birthplace of many faiths #bbctbq

@turn_david She's now an adult. An unrepentant one. Why is it our responsibility to 'rehabilitate' her?
A reminder that the father of these girls blamed everything from the police to our security services for them joining ISIS. He was later shown to have attended extremist rallies with one of his daughters #VictoriaLive https://t.co/4VELidLneZ
Define 'rehabilitation' in this context please https://t.co/T9zSnblz6I
People suggesting that she should be allowed to return to stand trial assume it's not incredibly expensive and incredibly difficult to obtain sufficient evidence of wrongdoing from her time in Syria. The line must be drawn at joining such groups @VictoriaLIVE #VictoriaLive
This girl has not renounced her loyalty to ISIS. In fact, she says she does not regret joining them. She is completely unrepentant. How can we deter people from joining terrorist groups whilst allowing them back? #VictoriaLive
Glad to see @nixmalik doing her best to point out the terrible comparison between joining the Islamic State and being drugged, raped and threatened like the Rochdale grooming scandal. #VictoriaLive
Great work @macergifford. He points out that these girls went out to the 'caliphate' in the full height of information about them. She knew about the rape, beheading, slavery and burning people alive. #VictoriaLive
Ah, @macergifford is on #VictoriaLive to talk about this story. I hope he cuts through the victimhood narrative that is currently being spun. There's a man on TV comparing the 'grooming' of these Jihadi brides with the grooming (see mass rape) of young girls from Rochdale

@LDNQueerMuslims @ElCapitahn So, is there no such thing as Christian homophobia then?

@SecularMomNC @SchmeckleTV @baxter_daniel Recap:		You: "where are white people a victim of racism at the hands of non-whites?"		Me: "UK grooming gangs"		You: "why are you bringing that up? What about the Catholic church?!"		Utterly bizarre
@SecularMomNC @SchmeckleTV @baxter_daniel How are the two related? What are you on about? You are all over the place. I criticise the abuses of the Catholic church AND those of 'Asian grooming' gangs. You seem incapable of doing both
@SecularMomNC @SchmeckleTV Where were they yelling out racial slurs? What's your evidence?
@baxter_daniel @SecularMomNC @SchmeckleTV Amazing. And she did not care. Odd that. It's only child rape
@SecularMomNC @SchmeckleTV @baxter_daniel Because *you* asked how white people are suffering from racism from non-white people. Are you ok?
@SecularMomNC @SchmeckleTV @baxter_daniel Yes. I go on all the time about how I don't care about the abuses of the Catholic church...especially when it's black kids. What is wrong with you?

@ajdube More circular reasoning. If I said everyone wearing a hijab supported ISIS ideology, would you agree this was fair? No, you think I was a bit simple and probably bigoted. This is such a low bar of logic to clear. I can't do it for you
@ajdube Promoting myself? I'm promoting you. This is a globally interconnected, publicly accessible social network. If you wanted a private conversation, you've made an error of judgment. And you still can't tell me what these kids did. You're blinded by tribalism
'Not knowing what they were doing'? Again, what were they doing? What were they doing that justified it being national news? https://t.co/t84BUKLCYS

@ajdube I'm not trying to though, am I?
No, it sends the clear message 'Make America Great Again'. You have *assumed* that everyone who wears it is doing so to support 'white nationalism'. Which is irrational https://t.co/Alh6ADPfHd
Circular reasoning. 'All Trump supporters are racist and bigoted, therefore anyone who supports Trump is a racist bigot'. Good luck with that at the next election https://t.co/AnAaJ7r6tx
@ajdube I say congratulations helping Trump to a second term. It appears you didn't learn that claiming your political opponents were all racist/evil during the election didn't work.
@ajdube You can't even tell me what they are guilty of. You are almost advocating a sort of thought-crime. You humiliate yourself. What happened to evidence based arguments?

@ajdube @godless_mom @Ian485 @MrOzAtheist @mark_melbin @ChubblyWarner @YouTube @realDonaldTrump The 'hat is racist' is a circular argument. Not only are unable to spot logical fallacies, you can read minds too. Are you sure you don't believe in God?

@ajdube @MrOzAtheist @ChubblyWarner @YouTube @godless_mom @realDonaldTrump This is utterly deranged. We have zero evidence of any wrongdoing, yet we have tons of evidence that contradicts very specific claims of wrongdoing. On video. 'Guilty' of what? What are you talking about?
@ajdube @MrOzAtheist @ChubblyWarner @YouTube @godless_mom @realDonaldTrump And what do you think 'hypocritical' means? Every claim I am making is backed up with evidence. You're the other guy

@ajdube @godless_mom @Ian485 @MrOzAtheist @mark_melbin @ChubblyWarner @YouTube @realDonaldTrump 'Far from innocent'? What are they guilty of, exactly? This is utterly bizarre.
@ajdube @godless_mom @Ian485 @MrOzAtheist @mark_melbin @ChubblyWarner @YouTube @realDonaldTrump Which assertions, specifically? They literally did nothing wrong. Did you watch the video in the thread you are replying to?
@ajdube @MrOzAtheist @ChubblyWarner @YouTube @godless_mom @realDonaldTrump I have to say, I'm finding the desperate desire to cling on to the most trivial things, in order to justify the mistreatment of high school children, a little deranged.
@ajdube @MrOzAtheist @ChubblyWarner @YouTube @godless_mom @realDonaldTrump 'Cat calling/harassment'? We saw a few seconds of some kids shouting 'MAGA' at some girls with zero context. That's not how you described it. Were you responsible for the behaviour of everyone at your school then?
@ajdube @godless_mom @Ian485 @MrOzAtheist @mark_melbin @ChubblyWarner @YouTube @realDonaldTrump They weren't 'criticised and lambasted'.  They were lied about, doxxed and threatened. Surely you can see that is wrong, regardless of their/parents political views
@ajdube @godless_mom @Ian485 @MrOzAtheist @mark_melbin @ChubblyWarner @YouTube @realDonaldTrump Yeah. I don't think anyone is saying that isn't a problem. I've said this myself. However they didn't do what was reported, which is the point

@photolayne @MaajidNawaz Again George. That's not an argument I'm making. I'm not claiming Neeson is dangerous. I'm not even saying he should be penalised or lose work over these comments. Can you please focus on what I am actually saying.

@Blitzkreg6 @Mirrorman73 @photolayne @MaajidNawaz It wasn't simply a thought. He literally patrolled the streets. With a weapon. "Four or five times"
@Blitzkreg6 @Mirrorman73 @photolayne @MaajidNawaz Although, having said that I'm not sure what the police would make of carrying a (presumably concealed and potentially illegal) weapon with intent.
@Blitzkreg6 @Mirrorman73 @photolayne @MaajidNawaz I never claimed a crime was committed. I claimed his behaviour was mental. I.e, extreme, irrational, reckless, dangerous. Mental, basically.
@photolayne @MaajidNawaz Yes, there is no such thing as "thought crime". I was suggesting that were one attempting to suggest that's what he was being criticised for, then they would be wrong. Yes, it is mental to behave that way. I wouldn't want a person like that near me or my family

@NJB198 I'm saying big brands that sell in the UK, which do confirm to UK/EU legislation in the UK still operate in markets such as China, where animal testing is mandated. This is why they do not have the 'Cruelty Free International' logo on them. They animal test

@ringtrick Not so long as 'genuine' remains undefined
4. So, in conclusion, as long as guidance on "safety concerns" remains vague, coupled with the fact a perception of safety can be subjective, I doubt this will do much to put the shutdown mob in their place. I suspect they will just continue to lean on the issue of safety
3. 'No platforming' arises largely as a result of individuals equating opinions with violence. 'Safety' is often invoked to close down opposing views. So my question is, what is the criteria for '*genuine* safety concerns'? Who decides? Will a claim to "feel unsafe" be enough?
2. I welcome this attempt to protect free expression on campus. However, the line about limiting speech where there are "genuine safety concerns" gives me cause for worry. Students already invoke the issue of "safety" to shut down debate or no platform speakers.
1. The guidelines are produced by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. They State "....freedom of speech in higher education should be upheld at every opportunity and should only be limited where there are genuine safety concerns or it constitutes unlawful behaviour."

@JoelQuez I genuinely think the man could do anything, he's that versatile. I loved The Wire and I was astonished to discover he's British. So, he's probably capable of Bond. I just find the push for it to be odd. Reeks of diversity obsessed identity politics.
@JoelQuez I think the suave, British, upper-class gentleman is the Bondesque aspect you have to nail. What you have just listed are essentially script directions, not character/persona. I'd literally watch Idris in anything, but I sincerely don't get this Bond thing.
@MrFathed So, a different story and mythology? As in, not Batman then?
@JoelQuez I think Idris is an incredible actor. I've no idea why people think he would be 'perfect' for Bond though. The characters you have just referenced are a million miles away from Bond.
There's no shortage of black talent in Hollywood that I would happily watch read a phonebook. However, doing something so unoriginal as "swap them with the traditionally white character" does them a disservice. Original, compelling stories and characters are what's needed

These people literally think of Islam as "the brown one" yet somehow consider themselves 'anti-racists'.

@kevin8seven That one requires courage. The other does not. I think my point is clear. I can't understand it for you, Kevin.
Haha. "You haven't said or done anything racist, but I'm going to label you one anyway". It's funny how you see criticism of Islam and automatically think about skin colour. What sort of person would do that? https://t.co/1hX9PLWqxi
Yeah. What's your point? Criticising the low hanging fruit of Nazism brings you applause. Criticising Islam brings you credible death threats. What does that tell you? https://t.co/7qK8cdT9qF
Where have I 'fought for Nazis to have free speech'? I've said it's a bad idea to engage in political, vigilante violence. How extreme of me. I've no idea what you mean by your second point. Do you? Also, how does any of that prove I don't care about arguments? Odd https://t.co/bE8zJddkMf

@try_thinking @Lukem2106 @SCG_77 What 'facts' are you missing here? This is extraordinary
@try_thinking We literally have a video of someone being racist. And you are bending over backwards to refuse to acknowledge that fact. Take some time to reflect on what you have become.
A man films school kids whilst repeatedly calling them "black cunts", then suggests they should be "sterilized" for "breeding" too much. You see this and claim it's not for you 'to judge' whether it's racist because you 'don't have all the facts'? Amazing @try_thinking
Extraordinarily deluded https://t.co/DkpOKpw5H1
@try_thinking You know we aren't arguing whether videos have consciousness &amp; opinions, so now you are being purposely cheap. Like I said. You are going to extraordinary lengths to fail remarkably easy challenges. You're not a particularly bright or serious person. I'll leave you here.
@try_thinking You literally said "the video is not racist". There are incredibly easy, moral answers to the issues put to you today. A could manage it. And you've put your back into failing at every turn. It's extraordinary how resistant you are to accepting this blatant racism
The guy in the video literally name drops Josef Mengele in an approving manner...

@try_thinking "As you can see, this lot coming out the f***** school, all these black c***s here", yeah, I wonder why that would ever be 'deemed' racist. It's ok to say "that's wrong and it's racist" you know. You won't have to convert to Islam &amp; vote for Corbyn or anything.
@try_thinking "black c***s with f***** sarees on" then went on to suggest they should be sterilized. And you don't think it's reasonable to deem that racist? There are idiots that scream "racist!" every chance they get. But you are also part of the problem for playing down actual racism

@try_thinking @Lowkey1324 I can't even get you to understand what 'sceptical' actually means either. You don't think it's concerning that an adult  would film *school girls* whilst making racist comments and talking about how they should be "sterilized"?
@try_thinking @Lowkey1324 'Really bothered'? I sent one tweet. Everything else has been trying to get you to understand you are not behaving rationally. Which seems an impossible task at this point. The minimum you can do is at least accept it happened. Bizarrely, you can't even do that
@Lowkey1324 @try_thinking The fact that there is no rational reason to think it's fake sort of does that. He's not surfing on a dinosaur
@try_thinking @Lowkey1324 No, you were implying there is a conspiracy at work. Which is something entirely different

@Lowkey1324 @try_thinking I'm not saying it isn't plausible. That's not my point. Besides, accepting things are true just because they are plausible, isn't scepticism. Which is my point

@try_thinking I give up. You have no good reasons to cast doubt on the authenticity of this video. If I go through your timeline will I find you unquestioningly sharing videos that bolster your existing beliefs?
@try_thinking I never said any of that. I'm trying to get you to question your unwillingness to accept the facts
@try_thinking 'Sketchy'? We literally have video evidence. Evidence which we have no rational reason to doubt. You keep banging on about scepticism but seem to have no idea what Occam's Razor is. It seems you just don't want to believe this happened
@huckingstout Yes, that is an actual hate crime in my eyes
@try_thinking You are literally doing what the far-left are doing on the Covington video - refusing to accept objective facts. This is bias, not scepticism. I'm not asking you to signal your virtue, I'm asking you to acknowledge the facts
@try_thinking I'm amazed you just aren't strongly condemning this.
@try_thinking The Covington video was people lying about what was in the video/filtering it through a bias and imagining something not present. The video in this instance is nothing like that. It is objectively bigoted. Can you can hear and see it, objectively. Understand the difference?
@try_thinking But we have a video of the actual thing the media is reporting...

@mollyhaarris Thanks for the response. I'm not sure I agree. I don't think religion is a scapegoat, but rather its often causal to a lot of huge problems in society. Islamism being chief among them currently. To point out the link is to speak honestly, it's not 'scapegoating'

@adamdeen What suffering has been caused by non-belief? I've already explained. The concept has and does cause immense suffering. Not to mention it's held our species back considerably. It's stifled innovation and thought throughout the ages. There is no divine truth. The idea is evil.

Which 'mistruth' is that? And so what? How would that change my argument about religious privilege? https://t.co/1vp2nXsZbl
@adamdeen So, that being said, do you know a version of Islam that doesn't propagate the awful, harmful concept of divine truth?
@adamdeen The idea that an omnipotent force can tell us what the unalterable, final truth is has caused unimaginable suffering/atrocities. It's a terrible, evil idea that evolved apes can claim to know what a deity demands of us. This isn't a controversial view. Post-enlightenment, anyway.
"When parents are refusing to take their child to school and, instead, protest outside of the school gates, then there's clearly a big issue." 		Yes. The issue is blatant homophobia in the Muslim community.
@adamdeen I never made that claim. I said the concept itself is an evil one and is responsible for great suffering. Please point to the tweet that highlights my ideological biases. I won't hold my breath. So, no version of Islam rejects 'divine truth' then? Got it, thanks.
@adamdeen How long have you been able to read minds, Adam? Are you taking this skill on the road? 		Alas, my question remains unanswered.
There isn't a single idea I hold that should be exempt from criticism. The fact that I may find the criticism "offensive" is not a valid reason to demand special privileges for my ideas. A religious idea is still an idea. And I can, and will, say whatever I want about it. #bbctbq
Yeah, and as a secular humanist I strongly believe many Muslims may benefit most from hearing criticism of their faith. To shutdown conversation in this way is to deny them a potential route of liberation from their dogmas https://t.co/JylqUpXwqu
@adamdeen I think the very concept of divine truth is particularly evil and responsible for great suffering. Is there an Islam you are aware of that rejects the idea that the Qur'an is the word of God?
Ah. "Molly" who studies theology says it's "dangerous" for AMW to politicize religion. I think the genuine dangers of politicizing religion have already been witnessed in tube stations, pop concerts, buses, markets and bridges in the UK. #bbctbq

Let's just paraphrase what's happened here.		AMW: "Islam is different from Muslims, Muslims are individuals. Islam is the Qur'an &amp; the example of Muhammad. Islam is evil"		Literally everyone else: "Why are you generalizing millions of Muslims?"		Depressing. #bbctbq
No one is addressing AMW's actual points today. She's essentially just being called racist and being told to watch her mouth. This is depressing. Man in the crowd of now saying we "can't say religion is evil". Blasphemy law essentially. #bbctbq
Jesus. Woman in audience says on the "Islam is evil" comment: "if I'd said all gays were evil, I'd be arrested! So why is it ok to say Islam is evil?". It's not the stupidity of the comment that bothers me, it's the overwhelming applause it received. #bbctbq
Yeah. I'm not a fan of AMW, but she's right today. This predictably went down the "not all Muslims" route, which is a rebuttal to an argument not made. #bbctbq

You have been utterly deranged by the election of Trump. It's ugly https://t.co/74omMEtf97
He's a racist psychopath? What? https://t.co/mXomokRv6T
Remember how we celebrated Saffiyah¬†Khan for smiling when a protestor got in her face? But of course, she has the 'correct politics' (see 'yours'), so it's different https://t.co/WGP4Uen77x
If this kid was of any other political persuasion and he did exactly the same thing, but in response to a drum banging Trumper, he'd be lauded for is courage in 'standing his ground and keeping cool in the face of provocation'.
I've never been intimated by a teenager smirking uncomfortably. But then again, I've never banged a drum inches from their face. Get a grip. https://t.co/uvSB5lkxga

@Beerandreason @Paul_HKR All the facts point the other way
@TomasDeTorque Dave is a conservative Christian, he is devout and it's harmful. He doesn't claim to do otherwise. Your atheist tries to get others to stop believing because it harms others, but atheists harm people themselves (but want to keep that quiet). That's my point. See?
@TomasDeTorque But it's a terrible point. Vegans are advocating for an exponentially less harmful system. Not a perfect one. Progress is made in increments, not with magical wands. The thing that annoys Dave most: vegans are right
@TomasDeTorque That makes no sense. I didn't say Dave was forcing anyone to do anything. I said he was arguing badly. And you are demonstrating the same fallacy. Because veganism isn't perfect (even though it's preferable), it shouldn't be argued for. What nonsense
@Paul_HKR @Beerandreason Yeah, one of the reasons I think there will be a systemic solution to this issue, rather than an individual consumer one.
@Beerandreason @Paul_HKR Exactly. And that's a bigger issue than most people know
@Stephencheatley Don't apologise to me. I don't have to eat that crapüòâ
@TomasDeTorque 'Own house in order'? And what would that involve? The worst possible kind of veganism is still preferable in terms of animal welfare and the environment to animal farming and meat consumption
@rogerokeeffe Not sure. Maybe. I'll level with you. Latin is not my strong point
@Beerandreason But I haven't. That's one vegan product. To answer your question: the logical solution would be to stop eating chicken and to try and avoid palm oil where you can. The latter will be solved systemically soon regardless
@Beerandreason I don't have to partake in any. I avoid palm oil
@Beerandreason I didn't say anything about atheism being a moral issue. However the views I just started about religion could be a product of anti-theism, secularism and humanism. Which are moral issues. The arguments I get against atheism are strikingly similar to those against veganism
Argument ad perfectus		Attempting to detract from harmful behaviour by criticising less harmful behaviour for not being perfect.		E.g. "Veganism kills some animals too!" Said Dave as he chomped into his fourth KFC of the week.
@6TallMidgets It's still far more ethical than meat. It's preferable in that sense. This is weak whataboutery from the Daily Mail. It's a common sneer which basically boils down to the sentiment "If you can't be ethically perfect, you are no better than those who are ethically worse". False
@Beerandreason It reminds me of all the times I've been called 'self-righteous' for saying religion is harmful, ethically unsound and I don't need it to be a decent person.
@Beerandreason Veganism at its worst is still better than animal farming in terms of animal welfare and the environment. These red-herring headlines and accusations of 'self-righteousness' are just distractions to avoid addressing the issues
BUT...It's not got meat in it. Which is its sole purpose. Who ever thought a sausage roll is the 'healthy option'? It's junk. 		The vegan food movement is becoming mainstream and it's rubbing the right people up the wrong way. https://t.co/jYrQJVbUen

@_Jean_Phillipe_ Hitch-22
@DavidSk04698389 @concretemilk No. But it's something you *personally* feel stronger about. That's the point. 9/11 is your sacred cow as far as topics for comedy are concerned. This is rooted entirely in subjective emotions. And I'm telling you it doesn't make for good argument
@DavidSk04698389 @concretemilk Yes. Because it isn't personal to you. That's the point. You have an oversimplified and closed off view of comedy because it's based entirely on emotion.
@DavidSk04698389 @concretemilk Sounds like a very callous thing to say. Where's your empathy? How can that not cause suffering?
@DavidSk04698389 @concretemilk You made a joke about viagra on your timeline. Using ageism and sexual dysfunction for a laugh. Do you not think erectile dysfunction causes mass suffering? https://t.co/GP5vVRBuKb
@DavidSk04698389 @concretemilk Like I said. Closed
@richardhartuk Your friends seem smart!
@DavidSk04698389 @concretemilk No, they are used in the setup. The laugh is supposed to come from the punchline which is essentially the sentiment that foreign workers are more efficient.
@DavidSk04698389 @concretemilk That's practically a progressive, pro-immigrant joke. The punchline has nothing to do with the victims whatsoever.
@DavidSk04698389 @concretemilk Ok. 		Q. What's the biggest difference between 9/11 and the Oklahoma City Bombing?	A: Foreigners once again prove they can do it better and more efficiently		Beyond the pale?
@DavidSk04698389 I know
@DavidSk04698389 @concretemilk So....you agree it does depend on the joke all of a sudden
@DavidSk04698389 That's not what I asked you. I'm not asking you to change. I was trying to engage in dialogue, but it's clear you are doxastically closed on this issue
@DavidSk04698389 Well, that's just not true. I'd wager I've thought about that more than most, but I don't think 9/11 jokes are automatically beyond the pale. Tragedy plus time equals comedy. Do you feel the same about Titanic jokes? Pompeii? The Romans?
@DavidSk04698389 Didn't say they would. That's not my argument. I'm disagreeing with your circular claim that making jokes about 9/11 automatically make you an 'asshole' that lacks empathy.
@DavidSk04698389 Absolutely. I just don't think feelings are always the best way to form opinions
@DavidSk04698389 Yes. You said. I just don't think you argue for it rationally
@DavidSk04698389 But again, it depends on the joke! Not every joke about 9/11 is targeted at people's suffering

I have to say. Don't ask us to talk about drugs whilst making us look at this. It's unkind. #bbctbq https://t.co/7j3NAr133e
Peter Hitchens tells us Marijuana, despite popular rhetoric, is responsible for "severe, irreversible mental illness". I'm not sure that's true, but I've always been suspicious of the claim it's entirely benign if I'm honest. #bbctbq
There are many drugs that are less 'harmful' in many ways compared to alcohol. However, given they are illegal, and therefore unregulated, you run the risk of contamination, poison, inconsistency etc which increases the risk. #bbctbq
RT @taxigrem: @GSpellchecker Alcohol is the only drug that you have to apologise for not taking, yet it's easily the most harmful.

@Edgy_Ezreal @KatieAKaras Ok, well I appreciate the discussion. Thank you. I have a podcast coming out on this topic later today. It's judgmental. Just discusses facts and innovation. It's free, you should give it a listen.
@lewisboulter Because the instigator is actually a councillor for the area
@Edgy_Ezreal @KatieAKaras Sure..
@Edgy_Ezreal @KatieAKaras Haha. Yeah. I tend not to be so opinionated on something I've never bothered to learn about. See the 'Dunning‚ÄìKruger effect'.
@Edgy_Ezreal @KatieAKaras I just told you. Animal welfare, human welfare and the environment would benefit exponentially. How can that be a bad thing?

@Edgy_Ezreal @KatieAKaras Who said 'mass murder'? And no there isn't. You seem to have no idea about what factory farming is
@Edgy_Ezreal @KatieAKaras It is all. Every single slaughterhouse on the planet is brutal and is torture. Can you cite which books you've read on this for your information please?
Farmers triggered in Shropshire. 		Veganuary bus adverts 'should be removed in Shropshire' - BBC News https://t.co/cEqTGbs9pg
@Edgy_Ezreal @KatieAKaras But I don't want any creatures to suffer unnecessarily. You seem to feel differently just so long as it's not one of your own. One of the other great things humans are (usually) capable of is empathy
@Edgy_Ezreal @KatieAKaras It would be far better for human health, animal welfare and the environment if they did
@Edgy_Ezreal @KatieAKaras Not possible. There is no solution to the mass torture of billions of animals
@Edgy_Ezreal @KatieAKaras All slaughterhouses. It's all. Well, they can't change if everyone eats meat. The factory farming system exists because too many people eat meat
@Edgy_Ezreal @KatieAKaras But yours is a false statement, because it logically doesn't follow. We're capable of mass murder, rape, cannibalism, torture etc too. It's an appeal to nature. It's fallacious because it's logically incoherent
@Edgy_Ezreal @KatieAKaras So...you should be able to do anything an animal does? That's your standard? Have you thought this through? Also, not all animals so eat meat, including ones that are closer to us in evolutionary terms than those of your example
@Edgy_Ezreal @KatieAKaras What you're saying essentially boils down to "I don't want to hear it". Not an argument against the initial point that the meat industry is a brutal and tortuous one.
@Edgy_Ezreal @KatieAKaras Where did I talk you down? 'Designed' to be omnivores? Designed by who? You do know you're invoking an appeal to nature fallacy, right? Our bodies are capable of many things. It doesn't mean it's compulsory or ethical to do those things.
@Edgy_Ezreal @KatieAKaras You said you don't go around talking down people for what they eat and do, then sought out two strangers on Twitter to say this.... https://t.co/afvYOa02O9
@Edgy_Ezreal @KatieAKaras I think it's more because you are making terrible arguments and calling everyone 'cunts'. This is what happens with no accountability.
@Edgy_Ezreal @KatieAKaras I'm saying buying a steak off a shelf or ordering it in a restaurant is nothing like a wild animal hunting for food. Your initial comparison is a bad one. Doing something that's unnecessary &amp; harmful doesn't warrant respect
@Edgy_Ezreal @KatieAKaras You know what are way worse than vegans? Anonymous, tough talking Twitter accounts with cartoons as their avatars. Haha. I've reached my quota for the day
@Edgy_Ezreal @KatieAKaras You've literally never spoke to me. I'm a stranger to you and you open with insults. Yet you want me to believe my attitude is the issue? Yeah, let me know the next time you hunt a wild cow with just your teeth &amp; nails then eat it raw. Haha

@BoozyVonD I suppose that's why no one ever gets shot in the States then.
@LickerOfWind0ws @jimmyjdawson You said the only reason business provide vegan options is because they are forced to. When asked for one example you instead show me a story of idiotic vegan activists kicking up a fuss. One of these things is not like the other. Just admit your mistake. It's easier

@evernork Obviously. But that's a mere preference, not an ethical issue. If there is no veggie option in a place that serves meat, then the vegetarian/vegan has no choice but to eat somewhere else, ethically speaking. It's good business sense to have a vegan option.

6. So, I'd like you ask you, what is different about the discourse now, compared to before the leave result, or the election of Trump? The answer: absolutely nothing. The left have doubled-down. There's a relevant Einstein quote about insanity that best summarizes this situation
5. Then we have a left-wing public who are completely avoiding the meat of the issue by copying &amp; pasting smug 'what about muh food banks' memes. As though two issues can't be discussed at anyone time. As though that isn't only for the benefit of your base...
4. So, firstly we have a Labour home secretary who is either painfully ignorant, deluded or lying on (illegal) immigration. Which is sort of like a maths teacher who can't multiply. Which. Actually, is sort of like Diane Abbott too
3. It's this sort of hairbrained leftism on the topic of immigration that stokes the fires of populism and the darker aspects of nationalism. We can see. We can read. The idea that this deluded individual could be our future Home Secretary will manifest at the polls.
2. These are not 'refugees fleeing poverty and war'. They came from France, after travelling through other European countries. They are economic migrants and everyone can see this even if Diane Abbott can't.
1. My position is to employ compassion and to provide assistance to anyone who washes up on our shores. They must be looked after and processed fairly according to the law. That's basic humanity....
