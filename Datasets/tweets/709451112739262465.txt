You get 2 bids for a home security system because you are looking to protect your family		One says, we see your problem &amp; we would like to build a wall to protect you		Other says no wall needed, criminals only enter through your front door, add cameras		NO BRAINER 		#BuildTheWall
After finding out what's going on at our Southern border, how can Democrats be against a barrier that would stop 99.5% of #HumanTrafficking?		Now that we know, there's NO excuse		But rather than support a wall they say it's a manufactured crisis		These people are truly sick
How can Democrats &amp; fake news media say the #HumanTrafficking crisis at our Southern border is manufactured?		Multiple agencies are telling horrendous stories about what's going on down there		Why do Democrats deny it?		Corruption		#BuildTheWall #BorderSecurity .@realDonaldTrump
Are Americans starting to realize President Trump is battling EVIL in our country that's been hidden by Democrats and the #FakeNews media? #HumanTrafficking
