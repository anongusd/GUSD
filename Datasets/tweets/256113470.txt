@ShellyAAlthat We offer the program to veterans, service members, and their families who fill out our mortgage application. After creating a full picture of your credit and finances, we’ll work together to make a plan that gets you closer to achieving your financial goals. -Lizzie
@ShellyAAlthat The Lighthouse Program is a no obligation service available to Veterans United Home Loans applicants. Lighthouse Program is specifically tailored toward helping applicants develop a plan for financial success, especially in regard to credit scores and reports.
@ShellyAAlthat Every credit scenario is different. If you'd like to speak to a licensed VA loan specialist regarding your credit, feel free to call Veterans United anytime at 855-846-2849 with no obligation. After speaking with you, they may direct you to Veterans United Lighthouse Program.
@ShellyAAlthat Many lenders call for a credit score of at least 620, although this requirement may vary from lender to lender. Some of the most important scoring categories include on-time payments, length of credit history, utilization rate, and more.
@ShellyAAlthat Unfortunately, we can't provide that information, being that we are a private mortgage company. I'd recommend contact the VA directly at 800-827-1000 for these numbers. All the best!- Lizzie
@ShellyAAlthat We also recognize that many service members are in a transitional period after exiting their branch of service. Many lenders will want to make sure potential borrowers have enough continuing, and reliable income to meet their monthly expenses, including a mortgage payment.
@ShellyAAlthat The way to find out for sure whether you are eligible for a VA home loan is to request a Certificate of Eligibility through the VA. This document can be obtained on your own via the online eBenefits portal or by mail and fax through your state's VA Regional Loan Center.

@frank_welch87 Maybe they meant that the VA puts a guaranty on all VA loans that eliminates a down payment&amp;PMI. The VA pays about 25% to the lender to recoup the loss; this guaranty helps reduce the risk to the lender but VUHL funds the loan.

@ChaosStrategery Understood, and we really do appreciate your thoughts and feedback!
@myownperson44 Cost will vary depending on a host of factors, from your lender and loan type to the location of the property and more. When all is said, it is always a good idea to have as much saved as possible reserved for closing costs.
Under 15% of veterans have used their VA Loan benefits, often because they're unaware that they're eligible. Share this post to make sure those who've served know the benefits they earned!

@ChaosStrategery I hear you, and we are glad that you were able to find a product that worked out for you in the end; that matters most!
@ChaosStrategery The Department of V.A. has the final word in these situations&amp;does not accept non-married, non-eligible coborrowers &amp; will withhold at least part of the guaranty for the loan, which bumps that risk right back up for the lender.
