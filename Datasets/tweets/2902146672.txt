@Huranshisuko @BernieSanders WHERE are birth certificates required? $80 for a birth certificate? In which state is that high to get an identification?
@BernieSanders This is a bunch of bs. I have seen the Mexican Electoral system, and across Mexico everyone is required to show your ID. That‚Äôs just common sense. If you don‚Äôt like the system, why you don‚Äôt introduce legislation to fix it across all states. You have been too long to change it.
@ajplus @IlhanMN Is this being investigated? üôÑ Yes. It is already illegal to physically attack, murder, and vandalized someone‚Äôs property in Indiana. https://t.co/h0mpq1ORnT

@RuidoEnLaRed @MBarbosaMX @MarthaErikaA Lo qu√© pas√≥ con la gobernadora no fue culpa de Barbosa . Era muy com√∫n que ellos usaran helic√≥pteros para trasladarse. Por otro lado, es una payasa que Morena sigua apoyando a un candidato que fue parte de los moches durante el sexenio de Pe√±a.

@RadioFreeTom @BulwarkOnline His ‚Äòdevolution‚Äô stared after the unfair attacks and coverage of Justice Kavanaugh.
