It‚Äôs hard to sue on egregious abortion restrictions in MO because it‚Äôs expensive to fight these bills and the court systems in MO often lean anti-choice. @alidreith https://t.co/RBXeS4FIm5
Another obvious barrier to care? Forcing abortion providers in MO to have agreements with hospitals. It‚Äôs an undue burden and an obvious TRAP law. @alidreith https://t.co/dOBRziPFM3
Rural OBGYNs can only have 3 nurse practitioners. In the Bootheel, there‚Äôs just one OBGYN and his practitioners for care. Loosening restrictions will allow more nurse practitioners to provide care for rural women.
If there‚Äôs no doctor in a rural area, nurses can‚Äôt practice there. That leads to nurses leaving the state so they can practice. @MONurses is working to loosen our restrictions to keep nurse practitioners in the state.
Heidi from @MONurses says nurses practitioners are forced to have everything signed off on by a doctor in MO. If nurses are too far from their collaborative doctor, they can‚Äôt practice medicine. This is devastating for rural communities who often can only access nurses. https://t.co/y1Gz3c97Mt

The Supreme Court made very clear in Roe v. Wade that restrictions on pre-viability abortion violate a woman‚Äôs right to privacy. A six-week ban is unconstitutional and we don't need it in Missouri. #moleg #NoAbortionBan
Six week bans have been passed in other states, but have always been rightfully struck down by the courts. Missouri doesn't need a ban that will ultimately be proven unconstitutional and cost taxpayers $$$ to play political games. #moleg #NoAbortionBan

Banning abortion at six weeks means taking a woman's choice away before she often even knows she's pregnant. It's unconstitutional, and we DON'T need a 6-week ban in Missouri. #NoAbortionBan #moleg
