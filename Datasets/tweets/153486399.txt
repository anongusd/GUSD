Mark Norris joins an overwhelmingly white, male, young, and extremely conservative group with a track record of oppressive ideologies.  Exercising your right to vote matters now more than ever. #SuppressionSaga

My Statement on Agriculture Committee Chairman’s Call for a Loyalty Pledge on House Farm Bill	https://t.co/dvpZLIDBop
After adding $2T to the deficit with their #GOPTaxScam, Congressional Republicans and the administration now want to cut billions from vital student loan programs, making college less affordable and worsening the student loan debt crisis. We must #StandwithStudents https://t.co/8p8FsxHw15
It is up to all of us to continue to combat the negative effects of global warming, and to conserve the precious resources that we have for future generations to come. 	#HappyEarthDay https://t.co/rgA5O7h4VA
I am deeply disappointed the conservation title remains the target for funding cuts. According to CBO, this Farm Bill cuts the conservation title by $800 million over ten years. #2018FarmBill
Simply having a job is not enough to lift someone out of poverty. Teachers across America are striking for better wages b/c, despite working a full-time, salaried job, many are forced to use SNAP &amp; Food Banks to feed their families. That is not the American way. #2018FarmBill
SNAP is the country's most effective anti-hunger program, helping 1 in 8 Americans afford a basic diet, with most recipients being seniors, children and the disabled. I cannot support a Farm Bill that will drastically cut these benefits. #2018FarmBill
The #GOPTaxScam means hardworking Americans will pay more. While Republicans claim we cannot afford Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security. If Republicans really wanted to do middle-class tax cuts, they could have. #TaxDay #TaxScam

The #PaycheckFairnessAct has been introduced every Congress since 1997 as a way to close a loophole in the Equal Pay Act of 1963. The time to act is now! #EqualPayDay #TalkPay #wagegap https://t.co/CBhe2EicrF
While today is Equal Pay Day, this is not true for all women. Black women will have to work until August 7, 2018 to earn what men made in 2017,and Hispanic women will have to work even further.This is a disgrace and we have to do better by the women of our country. #EqualPayDay https://t.co/qJE8memTSG
The wage gap is not determined by what field a woman enters into, what her education level is, or even her race. These factors only determine HOW much less she will be earning than a man during her career. #EqualPayDay #talkpay https://t.co/Nn0QISQNRw
The wage gap is not only a women's issue it is a problem that affects all members of our society. When women lose out on upwards of $10,000/yr in pay that is less money they can take home to their families, and less they can contribute to our economy. #EqualPayDay #talkpay https://t.co/PXGCHMa8Qr
Since today is #EqualPayDay I will be doing a thread on the disparities that women face because they are continuously paid at a rate less than men.  It is time that we ensure workers receive equal pay for equal work. #EqualPayDay #talkpay #wagegap

(5) #TrumpCare is telling hardworking families that insurance only benefits the wealthy, healthy, &amp; the young. I disagree.
(4) The @HouseGOP thinks tax breaks to the wealthy are more valuable than lifesaving care.  I disagree.
(3) For all the rhetoric about freedom &amp; choices, #TrumpCare sends a clear message as to where Republican priorities lie.
(2) I asked my @HouseGOP colleagues, “What is a life worth? What does it cost to save the life of a sick child or senior citizen?”

Today, House #WaysandMeans is marking up a bill w/o CBO analysis on its potential impact on the health of our nation. @HouseGOP, https://t.co/5dvEwKJbYE
5) The #GOP replacement is dangerous, reckless, &amp; NOT a plan to cover everyone. It will hurt the poor, the elderly &amp; #MakeAmericaSickAgain
4) And, instead of keeping coverage for Americans w/ pre-existing conditions, #HouseGOP enables insurers ONCE AGAIN to deny coverage.
3)  Instead of increasing transparency, the #HouseGOP introduced YET ANOTHER bill in the dead of night w/ little to no input.
2) Instead of decreasing costs for families, the #HouseGOP proposes families pay more for less coverage.
1) The more things change, the more they stay the same. Instead of increasing access to care, #HouseGOP wants to give tax breaks to the rich

I just introduced an amendment to #HR5003 ensuring that it isn’t enacted until @usda certifies it won't lead to less healthy food
H.R. 5003 fails to make meaningful investments in improving access to school and summer meals.
With 1 in 5 U.S. children experiencing #foodinsecurity, we cannot take a step backward.  H.R. 5003 does nothing to move us forward.
H.R. 5003 contradicts everything we have heard about the need for improved access to #nutritiousmeals, especially during #summermonths.

Without question, the federal role is necessary to ensure every child has access to a quality education. #ESSA
Local leaders must fight for strong student-focused policies and put our children first. We must transition smoothly into new ed policies.
States &amp; school districts need to implement #ESSA in a way that continues the focus on meeting the needs of our most at-risk students.

#HR5 is a step backward in our country’s education system. It fails our students and America deserves better. http://t.co/gcgf4MdpQs
#HR5 also eliminates wrap around support services that so many disadvantaged students need to succeed.
#HR5 focuses on math and reading assessments w/o providing support for literacy, STEM, and subjects that provide a well-rounded curriculum
#HR5 turns Title I funds into a block grant, even though schools across the U.S. rely on such funds to ensure children are given a fair shot
#HR5 fails kids, teachers &amp; families. It reduces funding, weakens protections for disabled students, fails to provide well-rounded education
It's Congress' job to reauthorize #ESEA. #HR5 fails the test. It undermines the law’s original intent of promoting #equity, #accountability
This year marks the 50th anniversary of #ESEA, which affirmed that every child has the right to an equal opportunity for a quality education
RT @repbobbyscott: Congress must act to close the achievement gap. #HR5 gets it wrong. We must keep the needs of all of our children the re…

@rustbeltrants Thanks for reaching out with your question! Feel free to ask me anything, anytime. I'll do my best to respond. #OH11
@rustbeltrants Second, the costs of Canada/Mexico taking retaliatory trade actions against our products, which both have already begun to do
@rustbeltrants Sure. I voted against H.R. 2393 for several reasons. First, it would have a negative impact on the U.S. livestock industry.
As many as 160,000 #Ohio workers will benefit from fairer hours and working standards. Let’s reward hard work and put the #MiddleClassFirst.
.@USDOL's new proposal would guarantee #overtime pay for eligible salaried workers earning less than $50,440, a victory for #OH11 families.

Concerned about #FastTrack, #TPA? Read my post on @HuffPostPol: "The Writing Was on the Wall, We had to Pass #TAA" http://t.co/8kd8QxOqpf
77 years ago today, the Fair Labor Standards Act established #MinimumWage, workers' rights. Now we need a #LivingWage http://t.co/R1vlSIwc76
I urge my colleagues to see #TAA through the eyes of those we serve. Let's ensure trade deals are not made on the backs of American workers.
While I'm disappointed in the passage of #TPA and the pending development of #TPP, I refuse to turn my back on those who make America run.
Is #TAA a perfect solution? No. But with #TPA done, it's our only option. We cannot let it go forward w/o protections for America’s workers.
The only viable option to give workers a chance is to pass #TAA, providing support for American workers who have lost jobs due to #trade.
While many Democrats such as myself oppose #FastTrack, we find ourselves between a rock and a hard place. Our hands are tied on #trade. #TPA
Today, Members of the House and Senate voted to pass #TPA, and the President is clear on his intentions to sign the bill post haste.
2 years ago, #SCOTUS struck down Section 4 of the #VotingRights Act. It's time to restore this safeguard. #ProtectVRA http://t.co/8LtGl7E1Re
I am thrilled with #SCOTUS ruling to uphold #ACA subsidies. Everyone deserves access to quality, affordable #healthcare. #ACAisHeretoStay
I'm glad #SCOTUS decided to uphold #DisparateImpact claims under the #FairHousingAct, an important tool for fighting housing discrimination.
