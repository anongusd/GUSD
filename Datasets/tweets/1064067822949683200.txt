@SenSanders I have spoken to him and told him my story I sent him everything that I have if I can’t get justice I’ll get justice in the world bank I have his word I’m in United States citizen born in Georgia my families been here for 200 years do I need to take asylum
@SenSanders with my hands in my pocket and a bullet hole in my chest but I’m gonna do everything I can to collect my wages so my family can eat I’m not a low educated moron I’ve been nominated for a Nobel prize in chemistry The duke of Ambra in Switzerland is a friend of mine
@SenSanders ever lawyer I talk to will not take a case agains A foreign business that operates in Mississippi because they can’t win or they might get killed Tryna Mississippi need more help than you can imagine Governor Phil Bryant is a joke he’s not a man of the people
@SenSanders Hard to collect your paycheck in Mississippi you got to be willing to kill your employer here to get your money I’ve never been willing to harm a fly but I deserve my paycheck I deserve it and have no desire to live somewhere else I invested my whole life into ms
@SenSanders I filed suit against my employer five minutes later I had a man with a gun in my face chasing me down the road me and my son threaten to kill us if we didn’t drop the sink it was a three time convicted felon and the cops wouldn’t even do a police report it’s hard
@SenSanders It’s murders were nice enough to tell me about it before they killed him I reported it to our share of our county that night they murdered him and the sheriff said I was an accident collecting your paycheck in Mississippi harder than you can ever imagine
@SenSanders I had a brother can years ago That was murdered for trying to collect his paycheck after working three weeks on a hot tin roof I threw him in a river and is murdered was nice enough to even tell me they were going to killing him The state of Mississippi says
@SenSanders My brother was governor Charles Clifton Fitch and he told me when I was seven years old there was nothing he can do for labor in a state of Mississippi when I turned 18 to leave but I love it here it’s my home
@SenSanders I work 365 days a year seven days a week I never miss a day my employer owes me six months salary and nobody will talk to me all I want is my paycheck I work my ass off for it 12 hours a day I work and they are not part of the system untouchable I’m a slave
@SenSanders President Donald Trump answered the phone he gave me five minutes of his time was one of the proudest moments of my life but he can’t help us tell me to call the department of labor Department of labor won’t answer the phone or the door I won’t my paycheck
@SenSanders I’ve been calling his apartment of labor for six months and I’ve been down there five times no one said they talk to me they won’t will take a report they won’t take a statement I have even called the president United States of America Donald Trump
@SenSanders Mississippi workers don’t have a chance they’re not subject to the constitution of the United States of America slaves have no rights Lawyers don’t take cases that they can’t win and they can’t win against foreign businesses
@SenSanders Mississippi workers throughout all of Mississippi do not have rights to collect her wages I know what you’re going to say how are you a lawyer lawyers in Mississippi Fight a case against Foreign businesses that operate in Mississippi there’s 14,000 of them
@SenSanders I like to thank you for coming to Mississippi to help the people at Nissan but that’s Small piece of the picture is 14,000 foreign businesses in Mississippi that don’t pay wages overtime workers cop unemployment insurance etc.
@sepzilla I have no doubt that you like to help talking to Nissan to waste the time Mississippi has burned in the past and I need to burn in the Future Mississippi people deserve the right side of the constitution not tomorrow now
It was the office of the governor of the state of Mississippi they invited these 14,000 foreign businesses in Mississippi knowing they were going to pay wages they was here for the slaves
We should be picketing on the governor front lawn Walking up 55 in the middle of nowhere don’t do nothing should be in the front yard of the Govenor hey is the work commissioner of Mississippi and this is his damn problem anytime he fixed it
They have no addictions these are the words of the president they know their slaves in Mississippi they like the fact of slaves in Mississippi The governor of the state of Mississippi a.k.a. work commissioner is a traitor to the Constitution of America he’s left his people to die
@graygoods Everyone’s against it in a state of Mississippi it didn’t cost nothing for slaves nope you have to treat them with dignity and respect and pay them like all Americans under the 14th amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America they have a war in Mississippi
If Mr. Bernie Sanders was going to help Mississippi workers at Nissan he would’ve made his speech at Nissan he would’ve made his speech at the governors office he’s the work commissioner of Mississippi
Even President Trump don’t want to help you they make too much money on slavery in Mississippi
I wouldn’t shed a tear for the governor himself standing on the corner begging for change Let his wife work the corners . Leave Mississippi go to a free state apply for asylum today in state Workers have no rights lawyer Lawyers in Mississippi are lie have no attentionHelpu

We can’t get our wages in this state is what I wish I was to see the politicians Wives begging at the churches for food I want to hear their children cry for milk at night and go to school hungry I want to see their lives as they grow up in a State knowing they have no future
Let’s watch those politicians wives apply for welfare is watch their kids come to school with no clothes worth a damn let’s see their family at the church begging for food let’s watch them walk up 55 Highway and keep going
Will tell you anything you want to hear they get elected Mississippi don’t vote for anybody No these politicians are our Friends They lie they cheat the workingman well I’m pulling wagons with their own backs Watch their children starve to death what’s their wives Apply for
Nissan is just the first of many Slave don’t have rights it didn’t matter if you was born here in America you an American I don’t matter if you go to church on Sunday are you going to be a slave on Monday

They recommended the department of the interior of the United States of America director a “move to a Free state State state of Michigan California Illinois Indiana etc.
Finally I called the President Trump‘s office he answered the phone they actually let me talk to me after an hour I’ll Splaine in the situation in Mississippi there is no hope Mississippi can run you into the ground and anything you can do We can do about it
United States Constitution does not apply to Mississippi whatever right you thought you was born with is just a dream I have called his Department of labor Show many times they have never answer the phone I went up the ladder to Atlanta Georgia they didn’t answer the phone
I asked President Trump To you help us In person there ain’t no hope you work in Mississippi there is no helping you you work in Mississippi at your own wrist slavery is legal There is no free man
Foreign businesses Don’t have to pay wages and lawyers In Mississippi don’t work for slaves so we’re just screwed
Morgan and Morgan has 8000 lawyers the Fight for the people unfortunately they don’t fight for the American people they fight for that foreign businesses they don’t pay wages you’re the coward of the people

@SenSanders The lieutenant governor it is running for office he’s a loser we need to working man Like the great governor Finch
@SenSanders We need to stop the slave state mentality we need to get a governor and is going to do to his job he is the work commissioner he’s a loser
@SenSanders Foreign businesses in Mississippi Need to leave our state this is our home I’d rather be poor and broke didn’t have you rich and fat
@SenSanders The governor is the labor Commissioner he gets money from Nissan they keep the unions out Happy as a slave state
@SenSanders Don’t get paid more you get Slaved more Only in Mississippi people think Welfare pays Is more
You want to become governor of the state of Mississippi are you had to do is coke your own mother to death they raise you to God
Mississippi is the lowest of the low you’re wasting your lives in Ms You’re wasting your children’s lives they have no future in Mississippi because Mississippi has no future they rob your own grandmother here when you give it a thought
If you could go to the state police with a work related issue like your employer stowed your paycheck and have charges pressed against him and put in jail In front of a judge in a jury you wouldn’t be having these problems but Mississippi is a communist state and you have no righ
Labor is in the hands of the lawyers not the judges state police cops sheriffs . Your employer pays your lawyer that’s the law and what happened to you doesn’t matter
Foreign businesses like Nissan and 14,000 others come here for the slave labor these are the True masters of Mississippi They’re not subject by law will you get away with anything they want
@leftgear @bravenak @HuffPostPol @BernieSanders You know it’s bad when you get Bernie Sanders the communist .Governor of Mississippi don’t care about you who is the labor Commissioner Who is the most powerful person in the state of Mississippi if he can’t do it or not willing to do it then you’ve already lost
@NewOrleansDSA I hope the best for you but Mississippi I never had labor laws they don’t enforce the federal laws they brought Nissan for the slaves labor they move out of here tomorrow if they had to pay you what they pay everybody else in the United States
@SierraClub @USATODAY I wish you the best of luck Mississippi is never going to help you Mississippi is a welfare and a slave state that Nissan came to Mississippi for that fact alone or they wouldn’t be here you don’t believe me talk to somebody from Nissan Tennessee they made three times you do
If you work for a company from out of the country a foreign business in Mississippi you have no rights they can do whatever they want to your own your own they don’t have to pay you anything Mississippi is sold her soul to slavers and their new masters
Do you self a favor move to a free state where the enforce the law Where is slavery is illegal were labor laws exist stop wasting your lives on a state that has no intentions of guarding your rights they will use you up and burn you out and not even give it a thought
New children can graduate top of their class in the state of Mississippi When you graduated 12 grade You and Jeff Rowe Boudin Something in common as six grade education most employers out of state won’t even take a Mississippi a Diploma they laugh at you
Employers in Mississippi can do whatever they want to you if they choose not to pay you there is nothing you can do to get your check can you call the Labor Department 30 times you could call the president in the United States of America you’re just out of luck in Mississippi
Mississippi’s is a fourth world country Run by foreign businesses the governor is a pawn Labor commissioner in my ass
Talk to any lawyer will tear you get a chance of collecting your money in that state of Mississippi you could work like a dog and be treated and search that you’re right
Big nasty filthy joke Your employer you don’t have to pay you at all they don’t have to do anything they don’t have to give you raises they don’t have to pay your Workmen’s Comp. they don’t pay your unemployment Camp Mississippi don’t have to do anything but stay at welfare state
Labor should never been put in the lawyers hands that’s a joke lawyers are lazy and stupid and have no desire at all of helping you labor should be in the state police his hands and so far you so you can file criminal charges on the spot labors a big joke in Mississippi
Workers rights in Mississippi is the biggest joke in the universe you have no rights in Mississippi you have no state laws you have no federal laws that they were in force labor laws are enforced by the lawyers not the law you can go to the state police because someone took your
@SierraClub @USATODAY Speaking as a man that’s been trying to collect his paycheck for over a year There’s no labor laws in the state of Mississippi that are enforced the federal laws are not in Enforced If someone ripped you are your paycheck you can’t go to the police and file a criminal charge you
