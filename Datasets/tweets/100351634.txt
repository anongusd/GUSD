Someone is not telling the truth here.. Or it is a little truth on both sides - KP was nervous about the direction &amp; Knicks were scared he would sign a one year deal &amp; bolt.

Hey @SBondyNYDN @IanBegley - why is this trade not complete? How many days does it take to complete physicals? I realize this team wants to keep adding to their loss total, but c‚Äômon man.. let‚Äôs see some NBA level hoops please..

@bmccandless I don‚Äôt think they get Zion and I find it hard to believe they get Durant, AD or Irving. My real hope is that if they get shutout they sit out and don‚Äôt blow $70+ on b-level players to say they got something..
@bmccandless Not every change has a happy ending. What happens when Dallas isn‚Äôt a winner? KP is losing then in the wasteland of Dallas. And if I was being truly delusional, I would say that KP comes back in a year from now on a max deal when the Knicks are a winner &amp; have KD!
Knick fans should be willing to give up a lot for Davis. #1 pick this year, one of the number ones from Dallas &amp; as many expiring contracts as needed to fit Davis contract. I am still wondering if KP will look back &amp; regret a chance to win in NYC. https://t.co/0PfzTdU7Mv
@Schmeelk @mooretosay It would be like having to deal with Oak &amp; LJ back in the day and chasing players thru the parking lot.. but having a surly &amp; prickly player on the court could be worth the hassle..!
@timseymour @ReformedBroker No Durant is your 2 guard.. Knox 3.. Durant can be any position 1-5
@Schmeelk @mooretosay On a separate note -- shouldn't Knicks fans want Boogie Cousins? Now that you need a power forward. Boogie would actually add the old school NASTY that fans should love.
Hey @timseymour &amp; @ReformedBroker -- why is Boogie Cousins not getting Knicks love? How excited would fans be with a starting line-up of Durant, Boogie, Knox, Smith Jr. &amp; the shot blocking machine Mr. Robinson?
@mooretosay @Schmeelk Like I said, this is the "selling the hope" version the Knicks fans must believe in. I think the rotations from Fiz and his communication strategy have been spotty to say the least &amp; the team's ability to finish games and be competitive after halftime have been brutal!
@Schmeelk @mooretosay If I want to sell the hope the sell would be that Perry &amp; Fizdale are respected by the current community of NBA players &amp; despite the losing, this Knicks team has youth, athleticism and a coach that understands (seemingly) the modern player. That is the hopeful side of things..
@timseymour KP didn't trust Mills &amp; hated that the team kept pissing on all of his favorites. Willy was traded, Kanter was downgraded, Melo was disrespected &amp; oh by the way they kept losing. He also saw that the Frenchise was getting no love either.
The best read so far on the KP trade. Unicorn not blameless -- he acted like a selfish star, even though he's never won anything in NY. But Knicks talked out of both sides of their mouths and bailed on KP when he didn't pledge undying loyalty - Another Hope &amp; Pray Summer! https://t.co/xTGRTqTIyQ
@ReformedBroker Seems like he knew he was a goner last night.. wonder if NY fans will turn on KP now?
That is a brilliant take.. Knick fans better hope that it works. But I am also aware of what @jimcramer often says - hope is not a strategy! https://t.co/ovbXVxzxyp
@timseymour Team has youth &amp; will now try to build around their own players. GM‚Äôs hate winning with other people‚Äôs players. If Fiz &amp; Perry don‚Äôt bring free agents then this deal will be seen as bad. If KP blows out another knee then it was a good deal.
@Schmeelk Yes!! Watch Mudiay now become a DNP machine!
@timseymour I am in the middle of the stages of grief.. I was angry but then realized the Knicks dumped all of their bad deals in Dallas. I like Dennis Smith Jr. - he is super athletic. I like all the cap space &amp; I like Wes even though he will never end up here. Two #1‚Äôs are a good thing.
RT @Schmeelk: The speed in which the Knicks did this is virtually malpractice. Why the rush?

@BillGriffeth @TheDomino @ScottWapnerCNBC Answer is NOPE!! And now Tiger is real close to being closed out!
@BillGriffeth @TheDomino @ScottWapnerCNBC Now it is getting interesting!! Tiger down 1 with 3 to go.. and Tiger doesn‚Äôt always do well in the ‚Äúcomeback‚Äù position.. This hole probably decides the whole thing right?
@TheDomino @BillGriffeth @ScottWapnerCNBC This may start to get interesting with the match all square going to 14..
Right now Charles Barkley saying what everyone is thinking.. ‚Äúthis is some bad golf!‚Äù https://t.co/34nEMSALoT
Right now this #TheMatch is just bad, bad golf.. forget an eagle for $1M - how about a par for $50
Right now Tiger is lucky he is not down 3 to Phil.. He is batting it all over the joint &amp; Phil isn‚Äôt doing jack around the greens. #TheMatch @ScottWapnerCNBC @TheDomino @BillGriffeth
@Puddychains @darrenrovell Was thinking the same thing.. maybe it is just the largest entourage ever..
@darrenrovell This is an SNL skit in the making!! If this keeps up Tiger May win because Phil won‚Äôt make it to the 18th hole!!
@darrenrovell Don‚Äôt you think the heavy breathing from Phil is entertaining enough?
My wife just asked me how much I payed to listen to Phil Michelson heavy breath for 5-hours.. And right now the forced conversation is BRUTAL!
Hey @BillGriffeth @TheDomino @ScottWapnerCNBC - why does it sound like Phil is somewhere between a 1-900 # heavy breathing or just an old out of shape golfer.. I worry he is going to drop in the thin Vegas air!!
@BillGriffeth @sicario9000 @TheDomino @ScottWapnerCNBC @steve_desaul I am actually getting excited for this fake match.. they seem more intense than I expected..
Didn‚Äôt think I would get excited about this PPV with Tiger and Phil - Barkley I‚Äôm the pregame and watching them warm up actually has me kind of pumped..
@steve_desaul @BillGriffeth @TheDomino @ScottWapnerCNBC I am going to watch but I am not happy about it.. first 9 holes will be like an NBA all-star game.. hopefully somewhere on the back 9 it will be close and some real competition will break out. course set up will be like some wide open muni I bet..

A Thanksgiving Miracle!!! Knicks hang on for a wire to wire win in Boston of all places!! 3 Knicks with double-doubles tonight. Trey Burke with 29-points..
@BruceBeck4NY Happily I was wrong! Knicks now 2-6 in games decided by less than 6 points
@Schmeelk Trey Burke bails Knicks OUT!! Can Fizdale please never give Burke another DNP..!
@Schmeelk Not only is the THJ TO a killer, but the missed free throw hurts bad..
@Schmeelk Still in major jeopardy of blowing this game sadly.. clinging to what was once a 26 point lead..
Knicks 1-6 in games decided by 6 points or less..
@BruceBeck4NY That what I asked earlier.. And sadly my answer is no.. but they did finish the third strong which was a nice change of pace..
Knicks with a 26-point lead!! This will be a heartbreaking loss when it happens at the end of the night.. C‚Äòmom how about a Thanksgiving Miracle!!!

@ReformedBroker Can‚Äôt have Kanter on the floor late he plays terrible defense. Tonight the Knicks lose because of REBOUNDING!! Brutal!

Kevin Durant drops 41 in 36 minutes on 17-24 shooting. He was lights out in the 4th. Warriors outscore the Knicks 47-16 in the final 12-minutes.. Durant seemed to love the garden rims!
Look who woke up in the 4th quarter.. from being tied at 91 to now a 16 point lead by the Warriors 112-96!!
Tim Hardaway not hurt &amp; the Frenchise showing his moves.. The Knicks tied at the half. Felt like it could get ugly, but for now this team is fighting the champs and not backing down.

@jimcramer Excited that my son is graduating from middle school tomorrow!! Always happy and smiling Jim!!
@JoeSquawk Put his face on the screen and ask the casual golf fan his name and you will get crickets.. He‚Äôs a great major champ for sure, but not a household name or face &amp; yes I will follow the Knicks too..!
@JoeSquawk Best player that most people have never heard about? Serious Golf fans definitely.. the rest I bet not so much..
@JoeSquawk @JeffCoxCNBCcom @BrianWSteel @usopengolf @DJohnsonPGA @JordanSpieth @McIlroyRory My only point is that the set-up should be fair.. don‚Äôt care if it is 70, 72 or whatever.. set-up should reward good shots.. After 2004 the USGA said the set-up would not penalize players.. despite all that tomorrow should be fun!

@JoeSquawk @BrianWSteel @usopengolf @JordanSpieth @McIlroyRory @TigerWoods I don‚Äôt think Tiger deserved to make the cut he was +5 on a hole he was holding an 8 or 9 iron from the fairway.. my point is that if I am a rights holder, I want to see a set-up where the top names make it to the weekend.. I could see rights holders being upset..
@JoeSquawk @BrianWSteel @usopengolf @JordanSpieth @McIlroyRory @TigerWoods The question is has the USGA created a set up that is hurting the broadcasters who pay all this money for these events? Do viewers really want a weekend without Jordan, Rory, Tiger and others?

Hard for the Rockets to win shooting 16.7% from downtown.. Trevor Ariza is now 0-10 from three.. Harden is 2-11 (but on at least 3 of those misses he was fouled with no call).. Still Houston is only down 7 heading into the final quarter..

You know things are bad when Walt Clyde Frazier is ragging on the Knicks.. he questions why Hardaway Jr. is the main option on the last two plays - notes that he couldn‚Äôt hit water if he fell out of a boat, but Hornacek keeps calling his number.
If the Knicks lose this game free throw shooting will be the reason, also the bizarre behavior of the officials..
@loualbanese Something about teams that wear the orange and blue!!
Tim Hardaway Jr. giving his critics and the critics of the Knicks front office lots of ammunition. 1-14 tonight, 0-9 from 3pt line.. oh yeah and he bricked 2 free throws late. I want to see him succeed but he is 2-24 last 2 games &amp; 0-12 from downtown..

Knicks deserved to lose this game tonight because they played no defense for 3 quarters and got down by 18, but NBA games should not be decided by refs.. Derek Stafford destroyed a potentially great ending with BS tech &amp; phantom foul on KP.. Sad!

@kevinlockett Your MVP has a BRUTAL contract with 10-years on it and is totally slanted to the player. That is like building a house on a cliff that has a history of mudslides..
To all the Derek Jeter haters today -- What new Marlins owner wouldn't have looked to shed a contract with 300-million on it when the franchise is bleeding red ink? Yankees have best farm system &amp; deepest pockets. Maybe, just maybe Jeter &amp; Co. know what they are doing?
Derek Jeter getting hammered for Stanton deal. Why.. He's part of a ownership group that bought financial mess of an organization with a bad farm system &amp; some insane player contracts. Is he supposed to just stand pat &amp; do nothing? In 5-yrs if Marlins are a mess than kill him..
@BillSimmons @robenfarzad Yes and sometimes you have to gut the house to build a stronger foundation for the future..
@StevenLipin Exactly &amp; when you can that type of player without giving up blue chip assets you have to do it.. Yankees still have holes and too many outfielders, but they are a better team today than yesterday.. Good for MLB too..
@sandymaltzman @JohnJHarwood How is it down there? Worth the trip? Hurricane impact?

@jonsteinberg Yes &amp; No.. Many obsessed with fantasy football.. But most 12-20 I know - and my sample is big - have more Futbol gear than NFL gear..
@jonsteinberg Late season numbers were strong.. Thursday night also not helping things out - NFL players are not built to play on short rest..
@jonsteinberg Or another take - NFL early season vs. MLB playoffs and playoff race, TV show premieres, &amp; Yes other options.. Ask agin in November..
@jonsteinberg Or maybe early season match ups don't have the drama of late season games which have playoff implications..
