Raise your voices to demand your senators #BelieveSurvivors and do the right thing: #StopKavanaugh: 202.224.3121, https://t.co/FTX9BPboGv
It’s terrible that those Republican committee members subjected Dr Ford to a cross examination like that, shameful that they will not call for an additional investigation like President George HW Bush did when Anita Hill came forward during Clarence Thomas’ confirmation hearings
That admission of how out of touch they are is staggering when sexual assault is something that happens to 1 in 3 American women as well as other victims. I guess that training Congressional Republicans had a few years ago about how to talk about this issue didn’t do the trick
It’s ridiculous that the Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee hid behind a female prosecutor because they knew they couldn’t appropriately question a victim of sexual assault without being disrespectful. Indeed, some statements they made later proved them right.
Kavanaugh’s temperament today was not at all befitting of a SCOTUS Justice. His disrespectful behavior-his entitlement hubris &amp; anger-toward the female Senators on the Judiciary Cmte was shocking &amp; entirely in keeping w/the type of toxic masculinity he’s been accused of embodying
I'm extremely thankful for Dr Ford’s bravery &amp; hope her testimony has the same impact on swing Sens @LisaMurkowski @SenatorCollins @JeffFlake @SenDonnelly @SenatorHeitkamp @Sen_JoeManchin @SenBillNelson as it had on the rest of our country. Constituents: keep calling 202.224.3121
Dr Christine Blasey Ford is incredibly brave &amp; should be proud of herself for testifying- something enormous for so many survivors of sexual assault to see. She is a hero to all of us who care whether or not a sexually violent person is confirmed for a lifetime SCOTUS appointment https://t.co/8VDroBptWr

Trump’s gag rule is designed to block people from getting accurate information about their health care, and would prevent doctors from giving patients the vital reproductive health care they need. Speak out with @PPActionCA &amp; tell @HHSGov #NoGagRule: https://t.co/gwjBrBgAaM https://t.co/xhUZiJu9ym
6/6 We’ve seen what happens when we take action &amp; speak out. It’s sometimes hard for all of us, but with so much at stake, we can’t stop now. @IndivisibleTeam's calltool makes it easy with a script &amp; numbers for your senators. Together, we can #SaveSCOTUS https://t.co/3RE7sXgCuj
5/With the threat of another Trump SCOTUS justice, the ACA &amp; protections for #IPreExist conditions, women, and seniors are back on the chopping block alongside worker protections and presidential accountability. Your voices are more important than ever https://t.co/y0lPPQYzmc
4/In our @NCJWLA Advocacy Committee meeting last week, we talked about how when Trump first took office, the conventional wisdom was that the ACA would be repealed. And were it not for the grassroots advocacy from people across the country, that could very well have been the case
3/In the age of Trump, I’ve been inspired by seeing people speak out &amp; take action for the very first time. Now, in our second year seeing the terrible impacts of his presidency, I’ve noticed some fatigue from both first time and seasoned advocates.
2/When some students were engaging in victim blaming during a class in HS I struggled to speak out, which you can read abt in my new @bustle piece. I was new to making my voice heard &amp; while it wasn't my most eloquent of moments, I'm still glad I spoke up https://t.co/R18bWApwJa
1/Just like Rush Limbaugh, Jason Lewis disparaged me &amp; other women as "sluts" for fighting for affordable, equal healthcare access. Folks often say it must've been hard to speak out-it wasn't easy but we all have chances to speak out on a daily basis &amp; that can be really hard too https://t.co/FUIm2KSpsI
As a proud @LosAngelesFwd advisory board member, it was great to join their podcast to talk about #NetNeutrality, money #BailReform, and how you can make your voice heard in California's legislature. Check it out: https://t.co/A3BGo9ri8z https://t.co/QmS9qPBPIg
I'm with @emilyslist: “Time &amp; again, Jason Lewis has shown us just how little he respects or understands women. In November, women — and all of our allies — have an opportunity to return the favor by sending him home and replacing him with @AngieCraigMN." https://t.co/JQiuCs9dxb

Kavanaugh’s record is terrifying &amp; includes trying to use his judicial power to prevent a young undocumented woman in US custody from accessing a safe, legal abortion. He will do nothing to protect the rights of all women to make our own choices: https://t.co/tWrb6y2mQR https://t.co/dWZE4XiRAj
Americans don't support Kavanuagh out of the gate — and when they hear how dangerous he is for women, it gets even worse. The more Senators hear from us, the more they realize they have to #StopKavanaugh #SaveSCOTUS: 202.224.3121	https://t.co/PSZ1VxXwI5
#SB54 #CAValues Act being upheld in court was a huge victory in our fight to protect immigrant communities from Trump's hateful deportation machine, and we will continue defending it against any future attacks from his administration. https://t.co/iEzNb0yNG7
Lewis said women voting for affordable healthcare “don’t have brains.” His ACA attacks are a pocketbook issue for many women &amp; their families. I look forward to women in his district showing just how much they do think abt who to vote for when they elect @AngieCraigMN in November
As I told @CNN, Jason Lewis' attitude toward women is incredibly insulting &amp; beneath any member of Congress.The brave women of #MeToo mvmt have reminded us disparaging insults like "slut" &amp; "parasite" are an attempt to silence them from speaking up &amp; fighting for healthcare 1/2 https://t.co/UB4DzzP0OU
