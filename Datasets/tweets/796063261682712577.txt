@lukeclem87 @medwoman1 @AZcardFAN711 @ChuckGrassley @Driveshard75 I can understand the fear, but she did forget it because it only came out in therapy. I'm not here to take a side, I only wonder, just like I do with so many others that decided to come out, why now? Why wait 20 and 30 years?
@dalipals_martin @medwoman1 @AZcardFAN711 @ChuckGrassley @Driveshard75 Supposedly she was hypnotized during a therapy session when this all came out.
@mparadis8711 @evilzenmuppet @medwoman1 @AZcardFAN711 @ChuckGrassley @Driveshard75 And hypnosis is not evidence!
@mparadis8711 @evilzenmuppet @medwoman1 @AZcardFAN711 @ChuckGrassley @Driveshard75 Thank you
@evilzenmuppet @medwoman1 @AZcardFAN711 @ChuckGrassley @Driveshard75 I would encourage you not to listen to the news and other people.. do research for yourself.
@evilzenmuppet @medwoman1 @AZcardFAN711 @ChuckGrassley @Driveshard75 Honestly and truly, I myself was sexually assaulted when I was only 8. It was done by another minor, so I know the feeling or being afraid to say something, but courage is not waiting till you see someone in a position. His character as a minor may not be his character now
@medwoman1 @AZcardFAN711 @ChuckGrassley @Driveshard75 Let me make this very clear, I'm not taking sides. I'm not saying it happened or didn't happen. I personally did research on the man and he has an impeccable career.  And before anyone says anything crazy, I'm a Democrat,  not a Republican,it's my opinion that he'll do good.
@SusieTaylorW @AZcardFAN711 @ChuckGrassley @Driveshard75 Why can't people have conversations where they express their opinions without being called dumb, stupid or any other name. I'm just curious!
@medwoman1 @AZcardFAN711 @ChuckGrassley @Driveshard75 Supposedly, she only remembered after being hypnotized, but she still doesn't remember everything. And even if it did happen, 36 years ago when they were minors. Is anyone noticing a tread in sexual assaults that happen decades ago just coming out. That's all I will say!

@SenFeinstein This is getting horribly out of hand and something really needs to b done. These are mostly people who r looking 4 a better life. Does it not matter 2 this president that we are a country of immigrants. Not talking about the first lady, but even the president married a foreigner
@VP @POTUS @MikeCrapo @RepHensarling This is getting crazy...how about using some real commonsense. With all do respect Mr. President this is all becoming a disaster. Just maybe, I will run against you in 2020, because it's all become a joke.
We must begin to look deeper than just the surface. Life is changing, but is it changing for the better of for the worse? Are we as people, changing for the better or for the worse. We must constantly strive for improvement in both our business lives as well as our family lives.
@uebelator @SenFeinstein @ChelseaClinton It's more than that. Discipline starts at an early age. The upbringing of a child plays a big part in the person they become. Do you agree?
@JohnKerry I wonder if there is a way that we can set up a phone conference to  discuss an important matter?
@CDBeee @NingaGinja @RonWyden @realDonaldTrump The problem is that the government has become more concerned with who has control rather than what the American people need and want.
