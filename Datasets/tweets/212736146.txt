@ryan_chicago @Xtina10twenty You should come visit us! Tickets go on sale Saturday, come stay next weekend! FUN! #wild
@Xtina10twenty @ryan_chicago perhaps Annette can snag some playoff tix?! Or she could come here! Xcel is in my backyard...
@Xtina10twenty I was serious about that road trip.
My heart seriously cannot take this. #mnwild
At least we earned our goal. #WildAvs
What happened to your team @ryan_chicago? üèÄ

@Xtina10twenty Colorado road trip? Pick you up in 30?
Game 7 boys! #mnwild #BecauseItsTheCup
Always a nail biter Wild...
Sudden death will surely be the death of me. I'm too young to die Wild!

@Sydthekid4444 Well as long as you loved it when you played and you have something new and productive to fill that time with, good for you!
@sydthekid4444 Are you playing club season??
In follow-up to volleyball, if you play in the west metro, or have friends that do, we could use a few more players at Armstrong 15s.
@ryan_chicago @HillTrev @LJFloch Deal! We'll chat soon, I have some other ideas as well. Lindsay might be in too!
@ryan_chicago @HillTrev @LJFloch I will definitely keep that in mind. If not then, soon...trying to get out of the country too!

@MarykayNasby @suebear For what being a sass? I already knew that. Where are you playing? I'm coaching for Armstrong this season.
@MarykayNasby @suebear Obviously, geez...sassy tonight. A simple yes would suffice.
@plsbrotha There are still three quarters left, you never know. A lot can happen! Although I do have faith in the Wolves.
@suebear @MarykayNasby Did you guys decide to play?
@klehnherr8 Ideally before Thanksgiving at the latest. The school is off 169 and 36th Ave. in Plymouth. Practice Monday/Wed. nights at 7PM.
@klehnherr8 If you're serious I would hire you. It pays, practice 2x/week from Dec. 2-March 3, few tourneys, practice at Armstrong.
Hope all you volleyball players had great tryouts today! And for those who aren't playing anymore, I need an assistant coach! :)

@jake_paige Unless it coincides with a trip to Minnesota I don't think it warrants a separate visit ha!!
@jake_paige June 29th, tasting 2-5pm, beer garden 5-8 and then the 125th Anniversary Fireman's Dance. Prob won't make it too late...ha!
@Xtina20Thirteen maybe... if so it was a long time ago. I vaguely recall doing something like that. Where did he live?

Purchased our @CraftBrewFestMN tix for 'Bago @Xtina20Thirteen - wish you could join @jake_paige!! #trouble #goodtimes
@MinnesotaNews As a Lowertown resident I have mixed feelings. Noise is my biggest concern aside from the contamination. Yikes.
@JamieStrange Sounds like a plan, I'll call you Thursday.
@JamieStrange I think I might be able to do that :) Thursday night? I'll be in Mpls earlier for a dinner and could stop after.
@jake_paige @Xtina20Thirteen Unfortunately it's not surprising to me...
Never thought I would ever say I miss T-Mobile...
@Xtina20Thirteen No kidding. Crazy when it happens in your own back yard.
@Xtina20Thirteen Did you see the big news in hometown?

@uhoh_allison How was it?!
Off to the Keys today!
@uhoh_allison Stomp a little extra for me tonight!! I will do a few from FL too!
@_battletested @xtina20thirteen Well, I didn't hear the entire thing...only bits and pieces.
@_battletested @xtina20thirteen I heard one and it was hilarious.
@Xtina20Thirteen I didn't reveal details don't worry :-)
@Xtina20Thirteen Any more drunk dialing this week?
Day at the beach, wallet and phone left behind, recovered, roadie in hand and Bob Marley on the radio. Life is good. http://t.co/okFJD7wx6z
@Xtina20Thirteen Definitely. Spent the day on Sanibel relaxing. Probably blinded some with my pale skin...
Now we're talkin, thanks FL! http://t.co/QlHE2zs4Cy
"I love the sound of evening." Agreed.
@Xtina20Thirteen "They?" Not sure, didn't think you called anyone your boyfriend.
@Xtina20Thirteen I loved teen night. Too bad the TWolves couldn't pull it off tonight.
Where in Fort Myers does one under 35 go for breakfast? Or dinner for that matter? Age discrimination is a new experience for me lol...

@Xtina20Thirteen That pic is terrible but it was fun!
@Xtina20Thirteen ditto started out the trip dumping wax on my cousin at dinner lol.
@ryan_chicago Thanks, my welcoming committee was awesome! Only thing is a tornado watch and rain right now - I've got supplies to get thru.
Can't wait to see the fam in Florida today!
I seriously am contemplating a shot of Jameson to wake me up at this early hour...after all, I'm officially on vacation...
Miss my little buddy...too quiet in my place.
@Xtina20Thirteen Thanks I will! Can't wait for sun and sand! Hope to add some other items to the list soon...
Maybe it's just me but I feel as if there are few "real" people behind many Twitter accounts. Isn't the point to engage and be social?
Three days and counting, can't wait for 80 degrees and sunshine ‚òÄüå¥üêä
@Xtina20Thirteen Heck yea should be fun!!! Friday will be a good time I'm sure.
@Xtina20Thirteen Okay that sounds great!

@Xtina20Thirteen Thanks! Heading to Kincaid's at 6:30 for a happy hour I forgot was today. Have fun though, I have to prep for tomorrow.
Is it too much to ask to pick up dog poo if u own a dog in Lowertown? It smells and one has to watch every step. Come on people!!
@exavierpope Just almost? Better luck to me next time. Haha! Seriously though, lame call. Nice win for the Bulls though without their stars.
@ryan_chicago Yes. But for real I'm in your city in May.
@exavierpope Agreed. Circa the 1970s.
@ryan_chicago Ha season will be over. Next year I guess. üòÅ

@KLehnherr8 Seriously? Good move, I thought you were one of the smarter ones... be careful and don't ride w/a stranger!!
@3Stacks60 Yes, it's getting depressing. I find myself more irritable too when I'm cooped up inside for so long without sun!
@Xtina20Thirteen @JamieStrange @katiemurph The funny thing is that neither one will get this until on or after Friday. They never Tweet.
@Xtina20Thirteen Great thanks - excited for Friday! Should be fun celebrating @JamieStrange  and @katiemurph's birthdays too! #ladiesnight
@3Stacks60 I bet, looked real nice...I'm heading to FL next week. Much needed get-away.

@AJSerina Agreed - and perhaps someone should write on the topic who knows the jargon...just a friendly suggestion :)
@AJSerina For a while! And it was used on the cover and in the first sentence of an article I just read in a sports magazine.
