This is a nice art piece. It‚Äôs the view from ‚Å¶@Medium‚Å© too. https://t.co/K9AZYZqunn
@Veronica Agreed. Within an org the thing is buy-in from different groups who have different needs. I‚Äôve found that including them in the process can be helpful. It‚Äôs like, ‚Äúshowing your work.‚Äù They‚Äôre on the journey with you and that helps.
@sriramk Lots more where that came from!
@sriramk Fun fact: In our first prototype I designed ‚ÄúFollow.‚Äù Then designed ‚Äúmoon‚Äù (don‚Äôt bother me) and ‚Äúsun‚Äù (bring it on). Because of ‚Äúmoon‚Äù I designed ‚Äúworship‚Äù (bother me with this tweet even if I‚Äôm in ‚Äúmoon‚Äù mode). We never shipped any of that.
@sriramk I mean I like the idea of ranking my loved ones higher but I also need to know if there‚Äôs a delivery. This is where we figure it out with creativity!
@sriramk Design challenge!
@glitch @AnTheMaker I like eating!
@Veronica When I freelanced, I shared my hourly wage plus an estimate for how long it would take. But I said we‚Äôd be in hourly fee land after delivered. That way, endless changes meant more paid work which is good when freelancing. And fair for everyone.
@cassiestirman @OneYoungWorld That‚Äôs true. That‚Äôs why I admitted that tweeting about winning an accolade is bragging! It‚Äôs worth it though, to get the word out about @OneYoungWorld.
@helenjstoddard Thanks Helen!
@deepakravindran @OneYoungWorld Thanks Deepak!
Yes, I‚Äôm bragging. But, the young leaders of @OneYoungWorld are astonishing and they teach me.		https://t.co/5m9RmV3vD1 https://t.co/k7KT6LLi7A

@peterseibel @lizctinva @waltshaub @jack @DNC Awesome. Love that. You‚Äôre a hero‚Äîup there with teachers!
@peterseibel @lizctinva @waltshaub @jack What are you up to these days Peter?
@craigpearce5 As in, it couldn‚Äôt be fixed?
@peterseibel Not too late!
@peterseibel @lizctinva @waltshaub @jack Of course ML won‚Äôt work by itself, Peter. But, we were never proactive‚Äîonly reactive. ML is a scalable way to track behavior associated with abuse. A way to spot early and not allow amplification. (Thank you for your contributions‚ÄîI‚Äôm sure you moved us forward.)
@gasca It‚Äôs a whole thing. Wait until Tea Time. I‚Äôm going to wear a towel. I love this. (Don‚Äôt tell HR.)
@jkarp I want whatever that thingy is!
@RealJohnMalone1 Seriously. I figured it was something complicated until I looked it up. Just lint!
@nanofura Actually, it was a nice toothpick. Infused with tea-tree oil. (Probably not recommended but worked.)
@MurphInCA Try a different charger. If you have the same problem, then you have my problem.
@StellarJ_bird Wow, strong recommendation. It‚Äôs a nice looking phone.
@LisaLu415 My problem was an inconsistent/nonexistent connection to the lightning cable (for charging and other things). Turns out there was A LOT of lint jammed in the port. Not sure what your pic problem is about. Google it!
@peterseibel @lizctinva @waltshaub @jack It will take forever Peter. Meaning, it will be a never ending battle. We need to get in the lead. The good news is that we are making some progress. Getting proactive with ML and seeing a drop in abuse reports.
@fayesvideo @eviloars Ah, good call.
@stui999 Maybe a little trap door type thing for the port?
@TomTarantino Nice! Pro Tip.
@toNeid I know! I was going to try that if the toothpick didn‚Äôt work.
@eviloars Ooh. I‚Äôm lucky that didn‚Äôt happen.
@StellarJ_bird Hah! How do you like it?
@SocialKimLy Good question, Kim. I ask Twitter about stuff that‚Äôs happening like, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with all the helicopters in Corte Madera?‚Äù (Gunman at the mall my wife and kid were about to go to and she happened to mention helicopters when she called me at work. True story.)
I was about to get a new iPhone but decided to Google the problem. Fixed it in a minute with a toothpick. #FGI folks. (Turns out it was just lint in the lightning port!)
@lizctinva @waltshaub @jack We are fixing it but it‚Äôs not a quick fix. Politics Twitter can be particularly unpleasant. Other Twitters‚ÄîK Pop, NBA, etc., can be healthy and even fun. I understand how participating only or mostly in Politics Twitter would result in this frustration. Still, we are fixing.
@bijan You are lucky‚Äîand you deserve it!

@toddbarnard @tomcoates I haven't read that, Todd. Thanks for the suggestion.
@tomcoates Hi Tom. Responsibility acknowledged. A ton more work to get to anywhere near this aspirational thread.
@sarahnaomi110 @leahmcelrath @Thom3700 I agree, there's a lot to fix. Once Twitter decided we serve the public conversation, it threw into stark relief just how much work we have ahead of us.

@leahmcelrath @Thom3700 There are many ‚ÄúTwitters‚Äù Political Twitter is toxic. NBA Twitter or K Pop Twitter are not. It depends on how you choose to engage.
@beniaminov I like it.
@LaurieJRowley It could be.
@WingsScotland What? It‚Äôs supposed to be aspirational, not funny. Did you think I missed the mark?
We serve the public conversation.
We have to talk. 	And listen.
Every expression adds to a layer. 	The layer is a conversation.	The conversation is humanity.
Let's talk about what matters. 	Let's have fun.	Let's evolve and change. 	Positively.	Let's argue. 	Productively.
Talk can turn into action. 	Collaboration.	How?
Everything is connected.
People talk about what they care about. 	Faith.	Food.	Water.	Shelter. 	Safety. 	Family. 	Health. 	Work. 	Money. 	Belonging. 	Fun. 	Friends. 	Status. 	Respect. 	Love.
One nation will not improve our global condition. 	We'll all do that.	Together.	Conversation doesn't see borders.	It's porous.
What's true?	We're human.	Our bodies are similar.	We get the same ailments.	We live on the same planet.	We share so much.	We are more same than different. 	Conversation reveals this truth.
What is the public conversation? 	Is it about something we all share? 	Climate?	AI?	Religious tolerance?	Race, nationality, gender?

Tea Time is a Twitter tradition. It started because I liked TGIF at Google. I suggested 4pm on Fridays to Jack. He said, "That's Tea Time. We'll serve Tea." But I had already bought beer. So it's called Tea Time but there's rarely Tea.

@sankam Hey Sandip. Yes, it was tied to SMS length. That's why it started with 160 minus the username length. 160 was SMS length.
Last year, we upgraded tweet length to 280 and guess what? Use of 'please' is up 54% and 'thank you' is up 22%. I love that! Also, people are asking more questions and having more conversations. All this, and the majority of tweets are still under 140. It worked.
Originally, tweet length was 160 minus username length. One day, I turned to Jack and pointed out that I got one more character than him. He said, "That's not fair. We should standardize." I agreed. He said, "How about 140?" I said, "Sure." And he updated the code.

@tonydebiase_1 @jack That's your opinion. Our research team studied this from many angles. It's not just pulled out of thin air.
@hannarchyst @goose_stoos @DanJackson415 @jack There still is a character limit! Science and study showed us phonetic languages want and need ~280. Not everyone will use this amount.
280 characters is only ~50 words. Long live brevity and creativity from constraint.
