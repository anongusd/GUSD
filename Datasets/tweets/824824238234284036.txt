@CantGOPanymore @BonhommePhilip @dbongino @AOC I am literate. I can read the platforms and can tell they are the same. Audio exists of Bernie praising Venezuela for their socialism. Granted, since it's gone bad in Venezuela, Bernie has backed off of this stance. Obviously
@CantGOPanymore @BonhommePhilip @dbongino @AOC Most of the Democrat Party openly and proudly claim to be socialist. The Democrat Party platform is almost identical to the US Communist Party platform. You are driving with your blinders on.
@CantGOPanymore @BonhommePhilip @dbongino @AOC Bernie Sanders has praised Venezuela in the past and single payer healthcare is a clear move towards socialism. The reason you can't see it is because it has to be implemented a little bit at a time as to be palatable to people. Otherwise, full force socialism would be rejected.
@ericswalwell The reason why the refunds aren't as big is because people didn't pay as much in taxes overall during the year. It's simple math that you should probably learn.

@CantGOPanymore Socialism = government control of the means of production.		You said socialism should be defanged.		2+2=4
@CantGOPanymore Anyone in an emergency situation can go to a hospital without healthcare and receive treatment. Hospitals are charities and it is the failure of all the citizens to not donate to them. Period.
@CantGOPanymore For now, that may be true. However, in the future, corrupt politicians will take advantage of this control they have over human lives. At least with private insurance companies, government can hold then accountable. Who do you suppose will hold government accountable?
@CantGOPanymore It refutes both of our claims with that statement so I guess we were both talking out of our ass! Lol
@CantGOPanymore I didn't imply that. I meant it shouldn't have control over military and the means of production at the same time. Separation of power.
@CantGOPanymore Doctors who don't really own their own practice and are forced to see patients. Many of the patients go in for something they suspect is wrong, but aren't really sick. Since the government is "paying" nobody sees the cost or cares. Doctors only have so much time to give.
@CantGOPanymore Thanks for making my point. That's why I say that giving them control over anything in our lives is a stupid idea.
@CantGOPanymore https://t.co/P4KIyuP5gY
@KamalaHarris Let me guess, every one of them are paid by the government to get the desired result, or else face getting defunded. Nice scam.

@MWO_Heloc @AnandWrites This government doesn't adequately represent the people and they haven't for a long time. It's the state of secrecy that has caused the divide between the government and the people.
@jamshedjohnny @AnandWrites If we are already getting the policies of tyranny from this government, it's ridiculous to want to give them more money and power over our lives. Move away from government dependence. Charity is much more effective and nobody is forced to give up their money.
@RealSaavedra All the Dems are refusing to accept reality. It was a great speech.

@MWO_Heloc @AnandWrites Its the government that should keep it's hand out of the pockets of the citizens. If you increase tax rates, businesses will move out somewhere else to avoid paying it. Example: New York
@MWO_Heloc @AnandWrites Are you going to say anything of substance on topic?
@MWO_Heloc @AnandWrites Vote with your dollars and encourage others to do the same. Don't like Amazon? Stop buying from Amazon. No need to have the middle man(government). I can keep my own hard earned money, not spend it on billionaire's products, and the government doesn't need to take from either.
@MWO_Heloc @AnandWrites There is no valid counter argument. Government is the main driver of bloody wars throughout the entire known history of human kind. The US government has been engaged in needless wars and it would be immoral to give it money, unless it's taken by force by the IRS.

@tedlieu @GOPLeader @realDonaldTrump We know you're not stupid. You're just being forced to say stupid things. Example: "I'd love to put restrictions on speech, but the first amendment prevents me"
Let's just blame everything on climate change, then if people don't submit to a tax you can call them racist. Brilliant! https://t.co/kjp7yy0Ph8
@AOC The accountability is on the parents who put the children in this situation. ICE saves many children who shouldn't be there in the first place. Funding from private groups is called charity.
@CBSNews She admits that there is a crisis at the border at least. She presents no solution and says a wall won't work.  Very weak.
@BinkerTelle @RepScottPeters @HouseDemocrats @PressSec So you're admitting there still is no evidence of Russian collusion then?
@AOC I think social networks and other tools, such as https://t.co/V3Lvgzafhk, make it much easier to find a job. We don't need government to get involved.
@dbongino It's because they have separated themselves from it.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Oh really? You think they should have verified the dossier before using it to obtain FISA warrants to spy on American citizens and a presidential candidate?
@EWErickson No. They've always been socialists. They're just devolving into communism, just as socialism always does.
@TalbertSwan You got a bad case of #TDS.

@robreiner You mean you had faith in government before? Very naive

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Your translation seems more like it's what you made up rather than what was actually said.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Illegals commit less crime because there are less of them than native born Americans. But what is the percentage of illegals who commit crimes?

@CantGOPanymore It isn't about reading it closely, it's about understanding what it means. Judging by another post you made about how it would be a good thing to investigate people without there first being evidence of a crime committed, it would seem you have a clear lack of understanding
@CantGOPanymore So, let me ask you this. What gun legislation would you want to see passed? It's my opinion that gun laws only affect law abiding citizens, while deepening the firearm black market. Banning guns takes self defense away from people, while criminals still buy guns illegally.
@CantGOPanymore They also have absolutely zero recourse if their government decides to go full on tyrannical.
@CantGOPanymore There is no such thing as "gun homicide". It doesn't matter what tool a psychopath uses to murder people. It doesn't make them any less dead. People commit homicides, not guns. Homicide is homicide regardless of how it happened
@CantGOPanymore I carry a pocket constitution with me at all times, read and reference from it on a regular basis. Our rights aren't granted to us by the government. Life itself grants us these right. The right to self defense is paramount to protecting the rest of our rights from tyranny

@CantGOPanymore Pharmaceutical drugs kill way more people per year than people killed by criminals using guns, yet I don't see you saying do something about that. They advertise them on TV constantly, and even admit that death is a side effect. But yeah, "gun violence" is the problem.
@CantGOPanymore Bottom line is, short of magically wishing firearms out of existence, there is no legislation that will curb "gun violence". People must take responsibility for their own safety because no one else will. Can't GOP anymore? Apparently, you can't constitution anymore either
@CantGOPanymore Comparing the US to Japan isn't an accurate comparison because they have much less population than we do. Of course they're gonna have less violence because they have much less people.
@CantGOPanymore Your claim of "there are too many fucking guns" isn't an opinion based on any kind of study or facts, biased or not. According to FBI statistics, violent crime, and all crime for that matter, has been drastically declining over the past few decades, yet we have more fun than ever
@CantGOPanymore I'll admit, it's difficult to accurately count defensive uses of firearms, mainly because not all cases get reported and some cases nobody gets shot. Merely brandishing the weapon in enough to stop a violent crime from happening.
@CantGOPanymore Over 90% of all mass shootings happen in a gun free zone. That is a nightmare.
@CantGOPanymore What? Why is this so bad? There are already tens of millions of concealed carry holders in America now. Defensive uses of firearms number over 500,000 times a year with countless lives saved. What is so nightmarish about good, law abiding citizens protecting themselves?
@CantGOPanymore It is unnecessary to force Americans to participate. Tens, if not a hundred, of millions will voluntarily participate
@CantGOPanymore Of course it's naive to think it would have an impact on mass shootings, because of the existence of gun free zones. It's about damn time for the people to stand up and protect their fellow citizens with their own firearms and the training to safety use them.
@Comey I was worried that you weren't gonna say anything at all. Cool move to say you couldn't remember things to avoid pleading the 5th. Less political gossip this way.

@CantGOPanymore Sorry for the typo. I meant the citizens must fix the problem themselves
@CantGOPanymore You've completely missed the point. The gun safety education isn't for the psychopath, it's for the rest of the citizens. Free gun safety and training classes with a nation wide promotion of concealed and open carry. The government can't fix the problem. The citizens must fit it.
@CantGOPanymore Let's try educating people about gun safety. No law or legislation is going to work to stop violence.
@tedlieu Except for the fact that you'd love to regulate speech of the first amendment wasn't in place.
@Toure @dbongino How "journalistic" of you to say. By the way, the NRA stated publicly that they tried to keep Dan on, but he declined. Get your story straight, or continue to look like a hack.
@ChrisCuomo At least you're not an advocate for silencing diversity of opinion or thought.
@matthewamiller Are investigations legal when started with false information? I'm thinking not.
@JoyAnnReid None of the above choices are relevant. How about someone who will defend the Constitution?
@tedlieu The most successful at not finding any evidence of collusion.
@RBReich The ones responsible are the parents of this poor child. To take children on this extremely dangerous trip to the border is the worst thing a parent can do. Especially since they could have asylum in Mexico.
@robreiner There will be plenty of wall space at the southern border. Lol
@robreiner Felon? That's quite a stretch of the truth, but you never care about the truth
@tedlieu @KurtSchlichter And? Now you want to regulate that same freedom you fought for.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Perhaps you should regulate speech. Tyrant
@CantGOPanymore It's not a story. The dossier is bunk. Hillary paid for the dossier which was put together by Chris Steele with Russian source. The only thing verified in it is Carter Page took a trip to Russia. You can keep making up imaginary crimes if that makes you feel better
@CantGOPanymore The crimes you have laid out are debatable, and after reviewing the facts they are weak allegations with even weaker evidence. They also ignore inconvenient facts. The dossier is debunked and is false and takes collusion completely off the table
@BillKristol @FLOTUS @RogueFirstLady Being unnecessarily critical every single moment of the day is not a good image for you.
@dbongino Liberals don't understand that sweeping investigations looking for unspecified crimes is fascist. Yet, so called "antifascists" cheer it on.

@CantGOPanymore For crimes to be investigated, it must be very specific in what crime was committed. You can't just sweepingly investigate a whole group of people searching for unspecified crimes
@CantGOPanymore Or someone willing to investigate a sitting president's family and friends in search of crimes. Don't know what crimes yet though!
@CantGOPanymore I know what evidence he doesn't have. Michael Cohen never went to Prague. Cohen denied going to Prague under oath. Mueller didn't charge Cohen with lying under oath, proving he told the truth. The dossier is proven false and exonerates the President of collusion.

@CantGOPanymore By your logic, the police could just investigate every American in search of a crime they committed at some point in their life. We investigate crimes in this country in search of perpetrators. We do not investigate people because there "may have been" a crime.
@CantGOPanymore So the accusation without evidence is enough to start an investigation to see if there were crimes committed? Still no very specific evidence of collusion. These are police state tactics. No evidence of any of these alleged crimes existed before the investigation started
@CantGOPanymore Weaponizing government to investigate people in search of crimes, instead of investigating crimes. How is this supposed to be fun? If a crime was committed, the by all means investigate, but with no clear crime to begin with, don't investigate people in search of one. Unethical

@tedlieu @MarkHarrisNC9 I think we should investigate voter fraud across the entire country. Let's sure up the vote and make sure no party can commit fraud. :)
@RBReich And Trump takes ownership of it because he wants border security. That's what leadership looks like. Taking on political liability for his principle's.
@JakeSherman Nope. By taking ownership, he dashed the effectiveness of the Dems blaming it him. American's would rather see the government shut down than to see more obstruction from Democrats on border security
@EricHolder I'm glad that isn't what happened :)

@DavidAFrench When you read the article, you find that none of it actually debunks anything and broadly speaks of events without any details. It does however admit that no evidence of Trump/Russian collusion exists. Only that some people in the Trump sphere may have talked to some Russians.
@realDonaldTrump Unbelievable they would open a special council based on an accusation of a crime without any evidence at all.

@freedom_moates Oh yeah, you really got "slammed". In other news, using the word "slam" politically has been over used for years.
@Jordan_Sather_ Especially when they find out that they spent their entire lives trying to prove a lie
@Ocasio2018 The tax cuts we're great and $15 an hour federal minimum wage is a bad idea. I don't see the problem here
@Jordan_Sather_ I don't think much of what they consider "new age" is new, but rather a rediscovery of what was once known long ago
@jwgop "The dossier is salacious and unverified" - James Comey	This was after they already used this unverified dossier to get FISC warrants, breaking Woods procedure. Even if collusion is found, the FBI's mishandling of evidence will get Trump off the hook.
@Comey Facts are stubborn things to remember too I guess. Mr. I don't recall.
@AndrewCMcCarthy At this point, even if actual evidence of Trump/Russia collusion surfaces, the DOJ and FBI's handling of the investigation will get him off the hook
@AndrewCMcCarthy If the FBI believed that, then they should have verified the dossier before getting a FISC warrant. They violated the Woods procedure.
@DavidCornDC There really isn't any evidence of collusion. The statement was accurate.
@cameron_kasky How do you suppose they will make that happen? If it involves infringing on our right to bear arms, I cannot support you.
@tedlieu How someone in Congress can say that illegal use of a private server containing classified information, including Top Secret, is stupid to investigate, or even ask questions about, is beyond disgraceful.

@cenkuygur Government doesn't dictate higher wages, the job market does. The federal minimum wage is a joke. If an employer wants to pay their employees pennies, then the employees can find another employer who will pay them a better wage.

@CantGOPanymore @WalshFreedom The government can force people into buying internet service, but when it's Comcast, people can simply not buy it.
@CantGOPanymore @WalshFreedom Of course I don't like local monopolies and there should be regulations against monopolies, however, giving the monopoly to the government and expecting better results is insanity.
@CantGOPanymore @WalshFreedom Lol Ok, how about the postal service? FedEx, UPS, and DHL blow the US postal service out of the water. Hospitals are charities that have helped more people than the government ever has. Shall I go on about how the private sector beats government in basically everything?
@CantGOPanymore @WalshFreedom Taxation is the taking of money by the government under the threat of force. That's what government does, forcing people to pay money that is then used on things they don't necessarily agree with. It's immoral. Charity and private philanthropy can do a better job than government
@CantGOPanymore @WalshFreedom There was no income tax before 1913. How do you suppose they paid for public goods before then? And we're we not a just society before income taxes?
@CantGOPanymore @WalshFreedom It is true that this year, that the federal government brought in more tax revenue than before the tax cuts. Even though taxes are taken out at a lower percentage, it's taken out of a larger capital gain, which leads to the increase in tax revenue.
@CantGOPanymore @WalshFreedom Im speaking on income taxes only, which is definitely theft. Other taxes can be used for public goods.
@CantGOPanymore @WalshFreedom Explain why you think tax cuts have something to do with the debt, or even adds to it. Keep in mind that after tax cuts are enacted, tax revenue for the federal government increases.
@CantGOPanymore @WalshFreedom The mistake the political left continues to make is to label Trump as some kind of idiot. He's a hard nosed businessman who made billions of dollars and he's a cunning politician, which is proved by him beating Clinton to become President. Idiots don't so these things
@CantGOPanymore @WalshFreedom What do you mean that corporations didn't need that tax money. It's was their money to begin with that they earned. Even if they don't "need" it, they can still use that money to grow their business and employ more people.
@CantGOPanymore @WalshFreedom Tax cuts have nothing to do with the debt. Debt and the deficit are dependent on government spending, which is out of control. The tax cuts actually increased the amount of money the government takes in and you can compare the numbers yourself. Income taxes are theft
@CantGOPanymore @WalshFreedom He did it for many reasons, but I agree with that. The TPP was a terrible trade deal. You don't like the tax cuts? Honestly, I'd rather there be no income tax at all, but I'll take the cuts that have been made with a smile.
@CantGOPanymore @WalshFreedom I can respect that, but I must ask, what policies don"t you like that President Trump has done? If you don't like the guy, that is fine, but I want to know what policies you disagree with
@CantGOPanymore @WalshFreedom I am one for good old discussion of political theory, but it is not the case this time. I've been following the facts on this case, and with the wealth of information available about it, I'm surprised you haven't come to the same conclusion.
@CantGOPanymore @WalshFreedom I agree that collusion will be found, but not with who you think. Trump/Russian collusion is a fairy tale, it didn't happen. There is evidence that Christopher Steele, who was working for Fusion GPS paid by Hillary Clinton, was working with Russians on the dossier.

@CantGOPanymore @WalshFreedom Furthermore, a FISC warrant was issued on Carter Page, and possibly George P, so they could spy on the Trump campaign, yet still not a single wiff of evidence since.
@CantGOPanymore @WalshFreedom The case isn't complicated enough for a 5 year investigation. They found the Russians meddling in the election and they were indicted. Only fools still think the collusion story is real.
@RealJamesWoods This video represents the Democratic party platform :)
@jaketapper You put way too much effort into this tweet
@CantGOPanymore @WalshFreedom Reason I know that he's got nothing on President Trump is because Trump is still president after two years of investigation. If he had something, it would have come out already. If there was collusion then get on with it already, but if there wasn't let the president do his job
@mikebwonder This is true. Until they die they are tyrants, but after they die they somehow become "great" and all their crimes are forgotten. Gives incentive to fake their own death lol
@WalshFreedom @CantGOPanymore Mueller already got to the bottom of it all. Now he's just dragging his feet and trying to get people on process crimes while looking for a crime that wasn't even committed. Should we let this scam investigation go on forever?

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump He said he doesn't have any businesses in Russia, which is true. He tried to make a completely legal real estate deal there, but it never went through, with no money exchanged. It's only a lie if you play word games.
@CandiceMalcolm Cultural suicide
@dbongino I see it everywhere too. Trump already knew this was gonna come out when Cohen's office was raided and attorney client privilege was broken. Like you said on your show, Mueller is desperate, and the media is backing him up.
@tedlieu Wow! An international real estate mogul was attempting real estate deals internationally. You totally got him now! Lol

@HypatiaAmerica @melania9021 @SenSanders @t1international You're right. Corporate monopoly and government control isn't the same thing, although they behave the same way and still use our money. Government control is called socialism, and is also a trait of communism. These are dangerous ideas, friend. Evil people will always seek power
@HypatiaAmerica @melania9021 @SenSanders @t1international Income tax is theft. Taking my money before it even goes into my bank account is arguably worse than me paying a higher price for something I'm choosing to buy. Even worse is forcing me to pay for a product I don't even want.
@BillKristol For my sake, I'll just take the truth, when it decides to come out.
@BillKristol There are some of us who think the investigation is grasping at straws to the point of harassment. For your sake, I hope your narrative is correct, otherwise this investigation is going to be an international embarrassment.
@HypatiaAmerica @melania9021 @SenSanders @t1international The role of government is to prevent monopolies from forming, not becoming one itself. It should create an environment where competition can thrive and people have choice.
@HypatiaAmerica @melania9021 @SenSanders @t1international Good governance is always taken over by the bad eventually. That's why you must be very careful not to give power to the government that it shouldn't have. You argue against corporations creating monopolies, yet willingly give the monopoly to government.
@kelseyev4325 @SenSanders Quite a few charities and people fund the caravan. Many openly say they are helping, such as Alyssa Milano for instance. I'm sure some other celebs are virtue signaling about it too.
@HypatiaAmerica @melania9021 @SenSanders @t1international And how about we rely more on charity, than on government?
@HypatiaAmerica @melania9021 @SenSanders @t1international And humans have had a history of stellar governance? Lol If a corporation has prices too high, people will buy from another company that's cheaper. However, once government takes control, it never gives that power back and we will forever be trapped and dependent on it
@HypatiaAmerica @melania9021 @SenSanders @t1international Government is only good a two things, killing people and stealing it's citizen's money. We need less government in our lives, not more. Government uses healthcare to force people to do things they don't agree with or want to do. Period.

@biff_maxwell @MrSoNso21 @marcorubio Furthermore, nobody knows which votes are legal or illegal because they won't tell us any specific details about the votes, even after being ordered to by a judge. Yes, all legal votes should count, but election transparency is also of equal importance.
@biff_maxwell @MrSoNso21 @marcorubio The lawyers asked the judge to allow illegal immigrant votes to count in court. It's completely documented that this occurred.
Liberals are literally arguing that illegal votes should count in an election. They are that desperate. Let that sink in.
@MrSoNso21 @marcorubio His argument is that the points weren't legally made during the game and now the lawyers want them to be counted.

@ggfundraise @AlanDersh Of course they do, but I've never seen anyone actually suggest that's what they should do. I thought it was one of those things to try to keep secret. I guess now it's ok just to blantantly lie to voters while telling voters you are lying to get elected

@AlanDersh This is not correct under the 14th amendment. The amendment does not extent to illegal immigrants due to them being subject to their home country's jurisdiction and not completely to US jurisdiction.
@tedlieu Unless, of course the numbers you start with are false. Polling is terrible nowadays.
@JoeNBC Nobody is saying abolish birthright citizenship. They are saying the interpretation of the 14th amendment doesn't include illegal immigrants due to them not being completely subject to US jurisdiction, but rather their home country. Same as if Americans had a baby while abroad.

@RepAdamSchiff Accuse the other side of which you are doing. Democrats had the chance to change immigration laws during last presidency. You can't blame Trump for enforcing them. Illegal immigration is dangerous, and we can't prove if the children actually belong to said parents.
RT @realDonaldTrump: Please clear up the Fake News! https://t.co/3VbIKbmKwP
@robreiner There is no way to tell if the parents are actually the real parents of these children, or if they're filthy human traffickers. The only moral thing to do is take these children in. It's a consequence of irresponsibly crossing the border illegally.
Socialism does not equal individual liberty.

@SquigglyLine21 @bowler4709 @scaleSQL @AC360 @donlemon @wolfblitzer @jaketapper @ChrisCuomo @dbongino Perhaps that is illegal, but no evidence is presented in the article you linked to and all allegations have been denied.

@SquigglyLine21 @bowler4709 @scaleSQL @AC360 @donlemon @wolfblitzer @jaketapper @ChrisCuomo So what you're saying is, they were illegally spying on American citizens before they even knew there was a crime? If what you say is true, then even IF there was a crime committed, the information about it was obtained illegally. Not a very good start to an investigation.
@SquigglyLine21 @bowler4709 @scaleSQL @AC360 @donlemon @wolfblitzer @jaketapper @ChrisCuomo It's supposed to be verified BEFORE getting a warrant! Someone wasn't doing their job! The dossier has already been debunked! Everyone except people in liberal la-la land knows this!
@SquigglyLine21 @bowler4709 @scaleSQL @AC360 @donlemon @wolfblitzer @jaketapper @ChrisCuomo It's called verification in order to establish probable cause. I'll lay it out real simple. Unverified information(Steele dossier) was used by the FBI to get a FISC warrant to spy on a presidential candidate's campaign. That's an undisputed fact, even in liberal media.
@SquigglyLine21 @bowler4709 @scaleSQL @AC360 @donlemon @wolfblitzer @jaketapper @ChrisCuomo Then why ignore the spying on the Trump campaign without there first being a crime? They installed moles into his campaign based on a dossier that was unverified at the time. Who the hell spies on a presidential candidate with unverified evidence!?
@SquigglyLine21 @bowler4709 @scaleSQL @AC360 @donlemon @wolfblitzer @jaketapper @ChrisCuomo That's just an accusation. There is absolutely zero evidence Russians conspired with the Trump campaign to sway the election. However, the Russians were running an ineffective chaos initiative for and against both presidential campaigns.
@SquigglyLine21 @bowler4709 @scaleSQL @AC360 @donlemon @wolfblitzer @jaketapper @ChrisCuomo Do you really condone investigating people in search of crimes? In this country, we investigate crimeswith evidence in search of who committed them. Otherwise, the police would pull random people off the street and hold them until they find a crime they committed.
@SquigglyLine21 @bowler4709 @scaleSQL @AC360 @donlemon @wolfblitzer @jaketapper @ChrisCuomo What crimes has Trump committed? What crimes have others committed and how does it relate to Russia? The special counsel has gone completely out of its original mandate. People are being investigated to find crimes rather than crimes being investigated to find people. Not cool.
@EricHolder @robreiner The accused had a right to see the evidence against him, dummy.
@SquigglyLine21 @scaleSQL @AC360 @donlemon @wolfblitzer @jaketapper @ChrisCuomo We're any of the guilty pleas about Russian collusion? Still no evidence President Trump colluded with Russians, while Mueller is indicting Russian companies that didn't even exist at the time of the election.
@BaconGrillin123 @BillKristol Well, I read about the indictments on the Russian who were involved. It was simple to understand. A third grader could understand.
@scaleSQL @AC360 @donlemon @wolfblitzer @jaketapper @ChrisCuomo Nope. To obstruct justice, there must be a crime. No evidence of a crime has ever been produced, which is why President Trump is still president.
@ChrisCuomo He's exposing corruption at the highest levels of the intelligence community, while the left wing media, especially CNN, ignores the giant elephant in the room, which is they spied on a presidential candidate's campaign without there being a crime or evidence thereof.

@jerome_corsi @realDonaldTrump Q's personality change is obvious in this post. Doesn't use the same terminology and is merely pointing out publicly available information (of which I already read prior to Q's post). Also, Q asks the same question he already asked in previous posts as if we didn't already decode
@acynicalhope @John_KissMyBot @TiredofBS13 Both articles are true, but the breitbart used an image of a Lego gun from another incident but they included the source of the image as "San Diego sheriff". Nothing is nefarious in the reporting.

Q decodes were always open to interpretation and that doesn't make what Corsi said disinformation. It's just his own interpretation based on political knowledge he has.
@LaRueRougeau @jerome_corsi @POTUS No they can't. The "No fly list" isnt an official list and has no authority to stop anyone. The list is unconstitutional.

@jerome_corsi @realDonaldTrump @POTUS If this Q was real, he'd have more important things to do than call people out, but to do it multiple times while claiming "it isn't about a single person" proves he is illegitimate. Obvious doublethink meant to destroy the movement.

@painefultruths @jerome_corsi @realDonaldTrump @POTUS It is clear by these posts that Q is engaging in doublethink. Q claims it isn't about a single person, fame, followers, or profit, and wants to stay focused on the Intel, yet he can't seem to stop talking about it which causes Q followers to chastise anyone making a few bucks.

At least the democrats are being honest about wanting to take all the guns. Now everyone knows they are the party of authoritarians. #2A
@SenSchumer What? Don't want then to find your hidden voters?
@JbarGarden @cameron_kasky I did. And also the one from 2018. I know how politicians try to play on the language to include semi-automatic firearms, which make up 90%of all guns in America, with fully-automatic firearms. It's a deception and it's obvious.
@WolfsBane1100 @cameron_kasky That ban didn't reduce gun violence, that downward trend was already happening. Assault weapons don't have a particular definition, but commonly refers to fully automatic weapons.
@chrislhayes Should we blame facebook or twitter when some of their users engage in human trafficking? Of course not and that's why this opinion piece is idiotic.
@cameron_kasky Define "assault weapon".
@cameron_kasky That isn't true. The second amendment as stated means that for people to organize into militias, the People's right to bear arms shall not be infringed. It doesn't mean "only in a militia". Furthermore, there are far more restrictions on the 2A than the 1A, so you're wrong.

@johnkhart Weak. When a veteran can't figure out that banning the AR-15 is a giant slippery slope, then god help us. AR-15's don't shoot any different from any other semi-automatic firearm. Semi-automatic firearms make up 90% of all firearms in America. https://t.co/4E4d5iNbHJ

@piersmorgan These things won't save lives. Your proposed "solution" only affects law abiding citizens. 80% of all gun related crime in the US are committed by criminals who got their firearms illegally(stolen or black market). Lastly, define "assault weapon".

@Lesperado1 @SenFeinstein We can't set in stone any opinions about the IG report until we can actually read and analyze it. To do so would be irresponsible.

@joncoopertweets That's a pretty damn good idea! Teachers should have the option to carry if they want to.
@funder @joncoopertweets Machine guns have been banned since the 1930's. Banning guns creates black markets. Criminals will buy their guns from black markets, law abiding citizens won't. The people need to defend themselves against these criminals and taking away their defense is counterproductive.

@RepSwalwell @TuckerCarlson You're going to have a tough time convincing anyone of that garbage. Everything in there has been public knowledge for awhile, and if that was evidence then Trump would have already been impeached. That isn't evidence of collision. How did you even get to be a politician?
@SenSanders The wealthy already pay more in taxes. It's based on percentages, so that's a no brainer. Congress should give even bigger tax cut so people can spend more of their own money on things they choose instead of you.

@RepSwalwell @HouseGOP Assault weapons were banned in the 1930's! Read your history!
@joncoopertweets @realDonaldTrump Allegations are not the same as convictions. There isn't any proof he cheated on his wife. Accusation just aren't enough. He is innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.

@BarackObama Guns already have safeties. This happened is a gun free zone. No amount of gun laws can keep evil people from being murderous.
@JasonKander @NRA There isn't a gun problem, there is an evil person problem. Abolish gun free zones, provide armed security, and let teachers have firearms. You will never rid the world of murderous evil people with gun control.
@ChrisCuomo Abolish gun free zones, provide armed security, and let the teachers have firearms. This isn't a gun problem, it's an evil person problem. They way to fix it is to provide people with the tools to defend themselves.
@joncoopertweets @realDonaldTrump I would abolish gun free zones, provide armed security, and let the teachers have firearms. It's not about the gun, it's about self preservation.
@omarvaid It's not a gun problem. It's an evil person problem. You will never rid the world of evil people. If they don't have access to guns, they will use other means of killing. Killing doesn't take a gun, in only takes intent.
@SenFeinstein AR-15's are not "assault weapons". If you get attacked by someone with a pencil, does that then make it a assault pencil? That's how ridiculous you appear to informed people.

@SenSanders I agree! Considering there isn't a shred of solid evidence that's ever been presented, it shouldn't be an issue at all!
@SenFeinstein That sounds like exactly what needs to happen. #NoGovernmentInHealthcare
@SenFeinstein Here's how we can improve healthcare: government gets its big fat nose out of healthcare.
@terriecrowley @SenFeinstein That's ridiculous! The president doesn't want Americans to die nor does he want to destroy the country. Despite what CNN says.
@marcaspringer @SenFeinstein This only proves that other countries have taken the power of healthcare away from the people! Politicians have no business in healthcare!
@anhadrepooc @SenFeinstein Not once has this senator exercised any type of reason. She lies by omission constantly however.
@Seidbarspeaks @SenFeinstein @realDonaldTrump There are no leaders in government, only representatives. The People are the true leaders!
@SenFeinstein The ACA was DOA. Government should keep its nose on protecting our liberties, not mandating health insurance.
@sueday1970 @SenFeinstein Single payer means we'll never get the government out. Just wait till they start mandating things and deciding who lives and dies.
@EttaLnLavender @SenFeinstein Senators are not leaders, they're representatives. The People are the true leaders!
@BadJohnBrown @SenFeinstein @SenSanders Bernie wants to make healthcare a right effectively making healthcare workers into slaves. Sorry, but you don't have a right to others labor
@SenFeinstein The ACA is the worst and can't be fixed. Government needs to step away from healthcare and let the free market do its job.
@realDonaldTrump I agree! However, I prefer to call them representatives instead of leaders. The true leaders are the people!!
@SenFeinstein It's still unproven that WEN hair care products causes hair loss. Just saying...
@SpeakerRyan @SenJohnMcCain McCain continually met with ISIS members while insisting they were "moderate rebels". There is no such thing as a "moderate rebel"!!
