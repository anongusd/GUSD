@charliekirk11 I guess you are gonna ignore all the job creation under Clinton and Obama then? https://t.co/VcagbW4kW5
@4trump247 @charliekirk11 Basically all of article 1 covers all this. Use google yourself man, go self educate for once. Here is once example. https://t.co/qmKRwQXtj9
@4trump247 @charliekirk11 No, that’s what the constitution says it can do. Thought y’all loved that document.
@charliekirk11 Cool. POTUS too. Millions of government dollars go to his businesses.
@ThAlMeArCrEq @Avenger13Mg @WayneDupreeShow Yeah, I do find a lot of conservatives irrational. That checks out.
@ThAlMeArCrEq @Avenger13Mg @WayneDupreeShow Oh come on, you think she just tuned in for “exactly one minute” right st this exact time? Nah, she was hate watching the whole show. https://t.co/2pxS8EdDft
@ThAlMeArCrEq @Avenger13Mg @WayneDupreeShow Go check out Charlie Kirk, Ben shaprio, don jr. look at their TL’s for the last couple of weeks. Tons of complaining about celebrities.
@ThAlMeArCrEq @Avenger13Mg @WayneDupreeShow Lol if you had any reading comprehension you’d see I’m talking about conservatives in general / as a whole. Of course there are individual differences in any group. But it’s a well known characteristic that y’all “hate watch” Hollywood ad a group.
@ThAlMeArCrEq @Avenger13Mg @WayneDupreeShow Oh and the jussie smollett bullshit. Y’all wouldn’t shut up about that. Still don’t think you care what they think?
@ThAlMeArCrEq @Avenger13Mg @WayneDupreeShow Lol ok, that explains all the whining during the oscars last week from conservatives on twitter. Because y’all don’t care about what they think. Or when Di Niro said “fuck trump” y’all bellyached for days about that. Or how y’all hate Cathy Griffin. And on and on.
@ThAlMeArCrEq @Avenger13Mg @WayneDupreeShow Lol conservatives OBSESS over everything Hollywood and celebrities do.
@Avenger13Mg @WayneDupreeShow Because you desperately want to see your views reflected in popular culture so you can feel validated and relevant. However, a majority of American culture doesn’t represent you. So, you are mad at those who are in it.
Ok Trump supporters, he doesn’t believe our own intelligence services. But he believes Putin and Un. You really think he is all about ‘America First!”?
@Kessol @ScrotieMcP @MikeTausig @DanCrenshawTX @DonaldJTrumpJr @GOP Wouldn’t you agree that background checks for private transactions are a good idea then? It would protect the seller.
@charliekirk11 What about the pipe bomber trump supporter? Or the guy planning a mass shooting of top level dems? Or the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting? Or all of these? Is this #FakeNews? https://t.co/JHAZsUEgDD
@chuckwoolery It’s amazing y’all are so brainwashed that y’all believe this actually happens.
@WillReme @chuckwoolery Narrator: they don’t.
@ScrotieMcP @MikeTausig @DanCrenshawTX @DonaldJTrumpJr @GOP We don’t have universal background checks. Here in Texas I can sell my gun privately to anyone I want for cash. No background check needed, and it’s all legal.
@gooneygooner @rjamesfortune @DanCrenshawTX No, the whole point of 2A was to have “well regulated militias” so if the country needed defending we could call upon state militias. We have a standing army now, we don’t need 2A protections anymore. 2A wasn’t about being your own personal Rambo.
@826352 @imatrumpguy @dbongino You mean when Obama negotiated the Iran deal, had Iran give up 98% of its fissionable material and unfroze Iranian assets as part of that deal? Yeah, he was terrible at that. How much plutonium has trump got Un to give up now? Oh wait, they are still building bombs.
@GenXpatriate @dbongino Because we don’t want to teach little Donnie that it’s ok for o hold government workers hostage when congress says no to do childish demands.
@dbongino No, we said Kim would play him. NK keeps building bombs. Trump hasn’t done anything of substance.

@charliekirk11 Well, when those ideas are xenophobia, racism, sexism, giving money from the middle class to the super rich, gutting SS and Medicare, yeah, we kinda hate that. Obama sought to make us all better, trump is here for the white and wealthy only.
@madison99588530 @StuBenMor @13RidesUSA @sadsoc111 @charliekirk11 Trump also regularly lies about his net worth based on his personal feelings about his brand’s net worth.

@Friendspolitics @seanhannity @LindseyGrahamSC Y’all don’t really care about life. Y’all consistently vote against making healthcare affordable, y’all keep wages low, and cut the social safety net. If y’all truly cared about innocent children y’all wouldn’t do that.
@lionautomata76 @seanhannity @LindseyGrahamSC No, we just don’t want a criminal as president. And he isn’t winning with Un either.
@trumpATeam @seanhannity @LindseyGrahamSC And it’s currently Un: 2 Trump: 0 		Why does Trump keep giving up consessions? He’s doing this wrong. #ShartOfTheDeal https://t.co/xvhhGC9AAQ

@ColleenMcConn @memoseley21 @joanncryderman @michaeljknowles @realDonaldTrump Now imagine there is a group of people telling you that you wanting to present yourself as a woman was wrong and bad in some way. How would that make you feel? Would you feel safe? What about people telling you that you are evil and perverted?
@ColleenMcConn @memoseley21 @joanncryderman @michaeljknowles @realDonaldTrump Imagine you were exactly as your are now but in the body of a man. That’s the only thing that changed. How would you feel? Would you be comfortable? Would you be ok?
@ColleenMcConn @memoseley21 @joanncryderman @michaeljknowles @realDonaldTrump Kill themselves. How do you feel about that? Can you imagine living in a world where you feel your body doesn’t match how you feel you should be? Can you step outside of yourself and think about that?
@ColleenMcConn @memoseley21 @joanncryderman @michaeljknowles @realDonaldTrump They felt themselves. They no longer wanted to kill themselves. Their lives finally made sense. You couldn’t force them to live the gender they were born. I don’t mean to be harsh but your attitude it’s hurtful to trans people. You are part of the reason they want to
@ColleenMcConn @memoseley21 @joanncryderman @michaeljknowles @realDonaldTrump Matched their identified gender? Have you actually talked to them? Or is this all religious and academic to you? ALL of my trans friends tell me that they always knew they were born the wrong way. And when they got in hormone therapy their life changed for the better.
@ColleenMcConn @memoseley21 @joanncryderman @michaeljknowles @realDonaldTrump Ok, I’m going to accept you are being honest and not just an extreme bigot. Have you ever met a trans person? Talked to them at length about their experience? Heard how they wanted to kill themselves before they stated hormone therapy so their internal chemicals
@DrewBaye @CohenKevin @jimsinister13 @htowngator @RyanAFournier Can’t imagine why a black guy would be agitated by a MAGA hat....hmmmm......🤔. I’m not saying violence is the right response, but I understand why he feels that way. If you don’t you need to understand that black experience better.
@CohenKevin @jimsinister13 @DrewBaye @htowngator @RyanAFournier It’s a racist trope to call a black stupid. “Low iq Maxine waters”. He looks to old to be in high school. It’s all the same.
@jimsinister13 @DrewBaye @htowngator @RyanAFournier Cool that y’all are calling a black student slow at learning. Good job at not proving his point.
@RyanAFournier Yeah, it’s terrible the minorties that have been oppressed for hundreds of years are acting out at this disgusting administration and anyone who supports their racist agenda. Who could have seen this coming?
@ColleenMcConn @memoseley21 @joanncryderman @michaeljknowles @realDonaldTrump Jesus, you really picked a bigoted site. Was that the best you could do?  https://t.co/QagFaLcZu6
@Matthew18493128 @RealSaavedra Nah, I’m going to continue to fight to make mine better.
@ColleenMcConn @memoseley21 @joanncryderman @michaeljknowles @realDonaldTrump Lol I have degrees in psychology. What do you have? Just google searches and bigotry? Do you know any trans people? Ever talk to them? If so you’d know it’s not just a “thing they decide one day and go back the next.” https://t.co/suZ06OZnU0
@SebGorka Lol this coming from a site that once had a “black crime” section. Get fucked.
@JamesWhite_JR7 @DonaldJTrumpJr They really don’t.
@Rooksfd @DonaldJTrumpJr Yeah, trump is the worst. He called for violence at his rallies.
@suegonzales46 @DonaldJTrumpJr Lol it’s just a video of two people fighting. How do you even know the context is real? https://t.co/NxSk0xA4eR
@DonaldJTrumpJr Nah, y’all want us all to die because of y’all taking away our healthcare, lack of social support, and civil rights. Could careless if one of your bigots got hit in the face.
@chuckwoolery Yes, slave owners raped their slaves. What is your point you racist shit bag?

@Timpanist @dbongino Yeah but Scandinavia, Europe, Iceland, etc.
@LisaTalmadge @bubbagump324 Is his wife super busy or something?
@suzanne_weimer @RealSaavedra Explain to me why our medical care isn’t rated number one in the world while countries with single payer / universal healthcare are rated higher?
@suzanne_weimer @RealSaavedra This argument is ridiculous. We already publicly fund many occupations. There are also countries where publicly funded healthcare works and is higher quality than ours. Doctors aren’t special. Their desire for a high wage doesn’t eclipse my right to live.
@suzanne_weimer @RealSaavedra You are talking about slavery. When you pay someone it’s no longer that. It goes from an entitlement to a working relationship. You have a right to a fair and speed trial. You think lawyers, judges, jury’s, bailiffs, clerks, paralegals all do it because it’s just your right?
@HoustonChron check out what Houston rep @DanCrenshawTX likes on twitter.
@DanCrenshawTX is a bigot. https://t.co/3PSwbP9if5
@memoseley21 @joanncryderman @michaeljknowles @realDonaldTrump No, it does not. It flies in the face of all the science we have for trans persons. Just because y’all ignore it doesn’t mean it’s not real. Facts don’t care about your feelings.
@Archanon17 @HighheelsDes @washingtonpost You realize y’all ALWAYS say this no matter who the woman is. It’s shocking more women don’t come forward. https://t.co/9ZS5B0TpO9
@Blend88888 @suzanne_weimer @RealSaavedra No, things just take money to work, at least In our current society. You think our justice system works for free?
@JimKlaas @RealSaavedra It would still be tyranny of the minority.
@JimKlaas @RealSaavedra In case you forgot. https://t.co/2Nisruf2NG
@JimKlaas @RealSaavedra That’s not what you said when you started this though. You said those who paid in more should get more votes. In your scenario the wealthy would always win.
@dhernan1972 @RealSaavedra Those countries are leaps and bounds better for access to healthcare, affordability, and quality of outcomes when compared to the US.
@Hoping4agirl @dbongino It’s true though. It would become 1099-misc income, they’d have to pay quarterly taxes on it. She’d have to set up a legal entity to pay them through and keep separate accounting for it.
@humphrey_brian @seanhannity You are saying others don’t have a good education, but you don’t use punctuation? My 2nd grader writes better than you.
@seanhannity https://t.co/xqDB9pKklU
@JimKlaas @RealSaavedra Why did you change the subject? You don’t believe the poor have a right to have a say in society?
@dbongino @Hoping4agirl Her paycheck is fixed by the constitution. For her to redistribute it would cause massive accounting / tax issues for everyone.
@kh2911jer @RealSaavedra @strangerdayzz What does that have to do with anything? As long as he pays taxes it doesn’t matter.
@LA_Krag @RealSaavedra Trump supporter says someone else is a conman. Shocking.
@dhernan1972 @RealSaavedra No, like Japan, Osreal, Scandinavia, Iceland, England.
@Loren_jh @RealSaavedra We know that james.
@swallace101 @RealSaavedra Medicare runs more than efficiently  than private healthcare.
@lescaart @RealSaavedra @FLmom4Trump Congress gets its healthcare through the ACA.
@NevaCoblan @RealSaavedra @BernieSanders Japan, Isreal, Sweden, Iceland. Next.
@AlmostHollis @RealSaavedra No, he had a plan. There are countries where this is already successful.
@JimKlaas @RealSaavedra So the poor never get their desires met? Not a big believer in democracy are ya?
@MamaBearTo2 @RealSaavedra That’s not socialism.
@suzanne_weimer @RealSaavedra You pay for your current rights. You think those come for free?
@Matthew18493128 @RealSaavedra Except in Japan, Israel, Scandinavia, Iceland etc.
@KeithBarrett @RealSaavedra Not everyone who has a job has healthcare.
@MichiganTaxes @RealSaavedra @Awhatdafudge It’s crazy to make sure your fellow man can see a doctor? Have a decent paying job? Get an education? You are against these things? What is wrong with you?
@StephBest85 @Christian_Joho @charliekirk11 Democratic socialism and socialism aren’t the same thing. Go crack a book.
@Christian_Joho @StephBest85 @charliekirk11 If you are self employed and have preexisting conditions the only choice is to go to the market place. The options are slim thanks to Trump’s sabotage of the system.
@David_in_Dallas @DonaldJTrumpJr Wow you’re tied after doing two things months apart? You ok bro?
@BlaineSmitty @DonaldJTrumpJr Wow this is random.
@jimmybuh @DonaldJTrumpJr I heard trump upped it 9G this morning.
@KevinlyFather @DonaldJTrumpJr Narrator : “He can’t”
@CryptoLaughing @DonaldJTrumpJr I love my currency fluctuating like a someone’s heart with AFIB.
@6p6n6e @charliekirk11 Then why do countries with single payer / universal care rank higher than us in quality of care? https://t.co/48SL8vaoP6
@StephBest85 @Christian_Joho @charliekirk11 Bullshit, I own my own company, work my ass off, and pay a ton for insurance that doesn’t cover all my needs. Other countries have figured this out. We are backwards here.
@DaveThreed @charliekirk11 @BrianFreedom7 @BernieSanders @CNN Democratic socialism exists in capitalist states. https://t.co/eVH190N5qS
@bogan_poet @23Redphin @charliekirk11 You realize other countries have figured this out already. We pay more for less positive outcomes than much of the developed world. Plus, we are the only ones going into medical bankruptcy for the privilege.
@charliekirk11 M4A is less expensive than our current annual medical costs.
@ThisIsLaurenY @DanCrenshawTX Republicans have to go back 100 years or more to criticize democrats.
@SeiKenja82 @jasnonaz @DanCrenshawTX He wasn’t a socialist, he was a fascist. He literally founded the fascist party in Italy.
@DanCrenshawTX Mussolini was a socialist in his young life then became a fascist. Kinda like how Donald trump used to be a Democrat and is now a republican.
@StuBenMor @13RidesUSA @madison99588530 @sadsoc111 @charliekirk11 What does that have to do with his political alignment?
@DanCrenshawTX You sure talked a good game before you got into office. Now that you are there, you are just a divisive partisan hack. Pathetic.
@aidenpryde50 @patrick84_03 @DanCrenshawTX Oh please, the republicans did nothing but obstruct Obama. Merrick Garland ring a bell? “We will do everything possible to make Obama a one term president”. Hello?
@StuBenMor @13RidesUSA @madison99588530 @sadsoc111 @charliekirk11 Yup. If you think he is aligned with Bernie Sanders and AOC you are delusional. He’s more aligned with Nancy Pelosi.
@13RidesUSA @StuBenMor @madison99588530 @sadsoc111 @charliekirk11 Lol Obama was a centrist Democrat and a capitalist.
@13RidesUSA @StuBenMor @madison99588530 @sadsoc111 @charliekirk11 Ok “another american” without a profile picture. You really got me there.
@StuBenMor @13RidesUSA @madison99588530 @sadsoc111 @charliekirk11 You realize the ACA is a heritage foundation plan right? It’s a republican idea.
@StuBenMor @madison99588530 @13RidesUSA @sadsoc111 @charliekirk11 You enjoy still having a job? Not standing in line for food? Still proud Chevy and all of our banks are still around? Do you own a home? It still has value today because of Obama.
@jstod22 @RyanAFournier @usarocks500 No, you have to take the numbers in context. When Obama took office the economy was in the Great Recession. Our auto industry was on the brink of collapse. Obama turned our economy around. Trump is benefiting from Obama’s hard work.
@TheDemCoalition https://t.co/8pWRF5Bdka
@jstod22 @RyanAFournier @usarocks500 Sure they do.
@MaleyTom @RyanAFournier You need more than just number. You need the context they are in. When Obama took office we were in the Great Recession that bush caused. He had a lot of work to do to save the world economy.
@codycr6 @pragmaticleft @KrisPlanker @vaxchoiceeast @RyanAFournier Only because they have a strong republican house effect. They just got lucky this inaccurate numbers got it right that time.
@KrisPlanker @MusicalKasparov @RyanAFournier You mean the absolute mess of an economy that bush handed Obama? And Obama saved us?
@thesportsprojec @RyanAFournier @jshaveman Lol look at the numbers at the start of his presidency. Obama pulled us out of the Great Recession. Trump is riding high on Obama’s legacy.
@dontreaddd @DanCrenshawTX Just keep on relying then. Lmaoooo https://t.co/KoUk0O7tQS
@dontreaddd @DanCrenshawTX You seem really bothered tho. Triggered one might say. I’ve commanded your attention for over an hour. You are my puppet, dance for me.
@dontreaddd @DanCrenshawTX https://t.co/6cJtzwZRB4
@dontreaddd @DanCrenshawTX Does it bother you because you don’t believe he can take parody and criticism or you think because someone was in the armed forces they are immune to political mockery? Note I never mock his service or disability ever.
@KaitMarieox @UCLA You can tell this is all true and accurate because of the info wars logo. They never lie.
@dontreaddd @DanCrenshawTX Lol and your timeline is not exactly that too? How many times are you going to post that Resist pic? Where is your real photo and name?
How do you know you beat a conservative in a debate? They go off subject and start using ad hominem attacks. I also love how they see veterans / loss of body parts as a way to make someone above political mocking. https://t.co/gzakXn27pM
@dontreaddd @CjfRiley Yeah, I mock people who run away from debates. Who use fake news sources to make their points. Especially conservatives who mock safe spaces when they also create their own.
@Hairyplotter @dbongino I’m glad you agree there are areas we can improve. Now, don’t stand in the way of people working on those improvements.
@dontreaddd @CjfRiley Lmaooo you showed me!
@Hairyplotter @dbongino Yes it is irrelevant to the argument that America has areas that we can improve. The EU also wouldn’t exist without the help of the USSR. Does that mean the USSR was as good as the United States?
@Hairyplotter @dbongino Because when we look at other countries and see programs that work better than how we do things, it’s smart for us to do those things too. Just because the incurable industry lobbies congress to keep their record profits while we suffer doesn’t make our system good.
@Hairyplotter @dbongino That’s irrelevant to the fact we have ways we could improve ourselves. Why are you against improvement?
@dontreaddd @dbongino Social democracies are capitalist countries. Learn the difference. https://t.co/mktSx2ce4N
@Hairyplotter @dbongino Because we are the only developed country where you can go bankrupt from getting sick. That’s why. Because people have decide to buy food/ pay rent or get healthcare here.
@Hairyplotter @dbongino Japan, the countries of the EU, Australia, South Korea, Canada, and many more. Your American porn that we are the only place with freedom and opportunity is old and tired.
@dontreaddd @dbongino Are you unable to read? https://t.co/Uo7TfvkICC
@dontreaddd @dbongino I literally posted his explanation but ok.
@dontreaddd @dbongino He didn’t say they were. https://t.co/haMu8i5vR0
@Hairyplotter @dbongino If we are the greatest country to ever exist why aren’t we #1 in education and healthcare? Why do we still have homeless people? Why are we the highest in maternal death? Why do we have uninsured people?
@SchwerePanzer @dbongino Of the US was #1 in everything you’d have a point, but we aren’t. We can and must do better.
@JohnParshon @dbongino @jamesmathison Lol that’s not why they are protesting.
@dbongino He never said Norway was a socialist country. But that wouldn’t fit your narrative would it? https://t.co/6vdxWW0l1N

@dbongino Dude https://t.co/7Rs4FOsjbM
@madison99588530 @13RidesUSA @StuBenMor @sadsoc111 @charliekirk11 If your argument had any validity you would be able to explain why our debt skyrockets under republicans and goes down under democrats. If our socialistic policies were the problem the effect would opposite than what you are implying here.
@katelynveronica @RealSaavedra @AOC Because those people are worker and not the owners who aren’t paying living wages.

@dbongino There isn’t anything wrong with having a mixture of both philosophies.
@madison99588530 @13RidesUSA @StuBenMor @sadsoc111 @charliekirk11 You realize we have a had democratic socialism since the 1930’s right? And those programs are very efficient and popular? Expanding that isn’t a bad thing. Come on, your life will be better with our policies.
@13RidesUSA @StuBenMor @sadsoc111 @charliekirk11 Lol nice talking point without evidence. I just flushed your tweet down the toilet with my shit.

@MarkKendall_GW @PrisonPlanet @Patrici38689756 So there are no undocumented people in our prisons? Is that your claim you are making with this cherry picked example? Here is a study by the conservative Cato institute that says you’re incorrect. https://t.co/w1sYuztX7w
@charliekirk11 @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Y’all also hate higher education. It makes sense y’all wouldn’t be represented well there.
@MarkKendall_GW @PrisonPlanet @Patrici38689756 Lol I love how conservatives argue against undocumented persons by saying how much of the prison system they make up AND also say undocumented persons can get away with anything without punishment. Which is it genius?
@Candlest @PrisonPlanet Yeah, and he’s been charged. What’s your problem?
@PrisonPlanet Why do you care about one lie from Jussie Smollett but support a president who lies 7-8 times a day? Over 7,000 times since taking office. I’m beginning to think lies aren’t your real issue here.
@charliekirk11 Why do you obsess over Jussie Smollett’s one lie when you support a president who lies 7-8 times a day? Over 7,000 times sense taking office. Care to explain that?
@charliekirk11 @KamalaHarris You are correct. I want her to comment on the rash of white on white crime. Whites commit more crime amongst themselves than any other group.

@BamaStinson @wncbama @WayneDupreeShow You can’t prove a negative. Sorry try again. Still avoiding providing any proof of your claim I see.
@ElisaDoucet3 @kevinlpurcell @TomHaflinger @Mediaite Their job is to uphold the constitution of the United States. They are in law enforcement. If they suspected the president was compromised by a foreign power they had a duty to bring that to the attention of people who could do something about it.
@BamaStinson @wncbama @WayneDupreeShow What the hell are you talking about? Hitting the meth a little early this morning?
@BamaStinson @wncbama @WayneDupreeShow It’s very telling that you have no proof for your claims. Liars tend to deflect to other topics when asked to prove themselves.
@ElisaDoucet3 @KatzIzzie @Maryc1850Sadler @Mediaite It was just a conversation, and they knew it was the job of the cabinate. They never actually made any efforts to make it happen either. Also, 25a section 4 is for a president who is unable to execute their constitutional duties, it isn’t just for medical reasons.

@DanYork11 It’s even debatable if it’s constitutional for local police to enforce immigration law.
@DanYork11 There is so much wrong with this tweet. ICE demands cities hold undocumented people in their custody past their release date. All a sanctuary city does is follow their local laws and release the person.
@MSaundersUSA @Azwatkins @staley0225 @brettlewin @junior0319 @charliekirk11 Less dogmatic? It literally says if you don’t believe a guy died for your sins 2000 years ago, rose from the dead, and will come back one day, your loving god will send them to eternal punishment.
@DanYork11 @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump It’s not the local governments duty to enforce federal law. Sanctuary cities don’t have huger crime than non-sanitary cities, and in many cases have lower crime.

@RealSaavedra And here you are posting about her.
@S7G_USA @jeffyju @charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Also, your statement is inaccurate. Regan’s tax cuts caused a drop in government revenue. There is a max you can increase taxes to before Tax revenues start to decrease.

@DMills1947 @dbongino no
@CherylL26702902 @claydirtman @realDailyWire @benshapiro So you really aren’t pro life, you don’t give a shit about it once it’s born if you don’t believe in safety net programs to support it if needed. You’re pro birth.
@CherylL26702902 @claydirtman @realDailyWire @benshapiro I’m not making that decision, the mother is. I’m for giving them the choice on what to do with their body and their future.
@CherylL26702902 @claydirtman @realDailyWire @benshapiro Nope, it’s not a person till it’s out and surviving without the mother’s body. Until then it’s a part of her body just like anything else inside her.
@CherylL26702902 @claydirtman @realDailyWire @benshapiro Birth control isn’t 100% effective. By your logic poor people shouldn’t have sex then right? That seems like a reasonable demand. 🙄
@CherylL26702902 @claydirtman @realDailyWire @benshapiro How many orphans have you adopted? Our system is overloaded with them. Sometimes taking personal responsibility is to have an abortion.
@CherylL26702902 @claydirtman @realDailyWire @benshapiro Thanks for assuming my gender. This is a parody account. I’m not actually Dan Crenshaw, House Rep. What does living off the government have to do with anything? So, you are saying a baby is punishment for having sex?
@CherylL26702902 @claydirtman @realDailyWire @benshapiro Wow, there is a lot to unpack here. There is no “baby parts black market”. That’s a myth anti-choice people spread to instill fear.
@claydirtman @CherylL26702902 @realDailyWire @benshapiro You are putting words in my mouth. I said nothing like that.

@CherylL26702902 @claydirtman @realDailyWire @benshapiro What you are describing is slavery. You are taking away the woman’s bodily autonomy. Women have a right to control their body and their future. Are you for free daycare for children? Free healthcare? Free food for kids? If not you aren’t pro life, just pro birth.
@DineshDSouza Remember when you almost went to prison?
@MagnetoTheWorld @RyanAFournier Because it’s not a news story?
@TheHelot13 @jorg_rustige @RyanAFournier Do you remember the next day Russia hacked the DNC email server? Yeah, his “joke” worked.
@Mountaineer2013 @RyanAFournier Dude, that’s classic trump right there.
@claydirtman @realDailyWire @benshapiro Why do you feel you have a right to control and woman’s body and what she does with it?
@jaljll77 @axios Like it or not, this is the future we have to face. UBI streamlines the social safety net by consolidating benefits to a single program. The economy is changing and lots of jobs will disappear. The idea we need to work to survive needs to change.

@julieasmyle @PHXRat22 @LucarioDoT @tonyposnanski @TomiLahren I think it’s funny y’all stopped responding to me after I called you out. https://t.co/vVgvKWuB9c
@PHXRat22 @LucarioDoT @julieasmyle @tonyposnanski @TomiLahren Wrong bud. https://t.co/bcv8NvGhFt
@PHXRat22 @julieasmyle @LucarioDoT @tonyposnanski @TomiLahren Lol you been reading and watching the facts I’ve been sending you? Or you just gonna ignore?
@julieasmyle @PHXRat22 @LucarioDoT @tonyposnanski @TomiLahren Lol I’m literally providing facts. But ok. https://t.co/9FXQUuHyYF
@PHXRat22 @LucarioDoT @julieasmyle @tonyposnanski @TomiLahren Here is a bunch of racist things he has said. https://t.co/QI9TE8PSik
@PHXRat22 @NickRedeemer @aunebaby @tonyposnanski @TomiLahren It’s not a lie. He said it. Here, watch. https://t.co/EvJQLOvOb0
@PHXRat22 @aunebaby @tonyposnanski @TomiLahren So you’re using a soviet style propaganda tactic called whataboutism. What other people may or may not have done doesn’t effect what trump voters did. https://t.co/oAgJ2BhNf2
@PHXRat22 @julieasmyle @tonyposnanski @TomiLahren When racism pops up on our side we denounce it and call on the person to resign. Y’all keep electing them over and over.
@NickRedeemer @aunebaby @tonyposnanski @TomiLahren This has nothing to do with HRC, but the many racist comments Trump made while running. He started his campaign be calling Mexicans drug dealers and rapists. https://t.co/1JnqSJyA6M
@julieasmyle @PHXRat22 @tonyposnanski @TomiLahren You have to be willfully ignorant to see the GOP’s racism. https://t.co/HgMAPwSkRs
@prcmw369 @MAGAindex @RyanAFournier @RealJamesWoods Differing view points bother you?
@PHXRat22 @tonyposnanski @TomiLahren Well they consistently vote for racists and homophobes. Gotta be a value they share.
@aunebaby @tonyposnanski @TomiLahren Data shows that people who voted for trump did so because of race. Also, mike pence is a huge homophobe. You support him?
@FeelsGoodMan45 @kingofkings247 @DonaldJTrumpJr If this sets back race relations back in 2019, those effected were already racist.
@davij24 @medco_sdr @kingofkings247 @DonaldJTrumpJr Who said it was his fault?
@krassencrook @medco_sdr @kingofkings247 @DonaldJTrumpJr Agree! He shouldn’t tweet because we might criticize him! Great idea!
@Hoosegow1929 @kingofkings247 @DonaldJTrumpJr Yeah, such a hoax. We keeping finding guilty people.
@WriteBrainMedia @DonaldJTrumpJr You need to add racist to you bio here. https://t.co/yg4xx6lKK9
@DonaldJTrumpJr I mean, the real story here is how easily this story was believed. It’s not far off.
@MMadness101 @DonaldJTrumpJr I’m willing to wager you don’t have a small fortune with which to wager.
@PuckLoptr @cwarner1111 @aviator22903 @dbongino @LindaSuhler Do you teach yoga? Because that was a stretch. Previous SoS did the exact same thing. Wanna lock up Colin Powell?
@dogged46 @Annenync @chuckwoolery Speak the truth man. Millions of lower and middle class are paying much more in taxes and the 1% are paying much less. You good with that? Where are you Christian values? https://t.co/sDmudXXk1K
@dogged46 @Annenync @chuckwoolery If you are right, why did he give a tax break to the most wealthy Americans? Why are people in the lower and middle class complaining that their taxes went up?
@dogged46 @Annenync @chuckwoolery Also, BTW you say you are a conservative. Jesus was a hippie liberal and you would be angry at his acceptance of people and hatred of greedy people. Just saying. Learn your scripture.
@dogged46 @Annenync @chuckwoolery Lol ok, whatever you want to believe. I’m not here to force you into anything. We have the freedom to think what we want. Yet, all objective evidence proves you wrong. Trump has given the top 1% a tax break and hurt the middle class. I doubt you are the 1%.
@PuckLoptr @cwarner1111 @aviator22903 @dbongino @LindaSuhler She really didn’t, according to policy at that time. But whatever.
@Annenync @dogged46 @chuckwoolery I’m not playing semantics. This is literally the definition of politician https://t.co/qYAR1nCFsv
@Annenync @dogged46 @chuckwoolery Well, besides your weird Obama fantasy, there is nothing in the definition of  politician that meets your qualifier. I know y’all want it to, maybe y’all are saying he isn’t the establishment but that’s very different. Also, Trump ran for POTUS 3 times. He’s been at this a while.
@charliekirk11 Because he never did it to get around the will of Congress (ie the peoples will). Also, people like you called it executive over reach when he did.
@charliekirk11 A local official doesn’t have a duty or charge to enforce federal law.
@dbongino She’s not wrong. The most wealthy man in the world can easily pay $3B in taxes to make the community he will be in better. If he isn’t willing to do that, NYC can do better.
@realSteve1234 @BettyeMSmith @dbongino Oh ok, “real Steve”

@cartoonpaul @dbongino No, it’s totally not.
@TheOnlyShawn102 @dbongino Who started that dossier? Oh yeah! The republicans as oppo research on Trump.
@Golongtrading @dbongino They never even talked to anyone in the cabinet. It never got passed at meeting within the FBI. Literally nothing happened.
@SondraLynatHome @dbongino There was no attempted coup. And no, even if there were, it wouldn’t be treason.

@cwarner1111 @aviator22903 @dbongino @LindaSuhler HRC also hasn’t committed any crimes, unlike Paul Manifort.
@aviator22903 @dbongino @LindaSuhler What would the charge be exactly? Discussion of a constitutional process? That’s not illegal. You can’t just arrest people because you don’t like them.
@CoryCouture67 @dbongino Wow, you really believe this?
@creppswindyacr1 @dbongino Who was trying to deceive here ?
@Oldag1977 @dbongino Well Gary T, it’s not treason to discuss a constitutional process. For it to be treason Congress has to have declared war in another country and someone has to aid it give comfort to them.
@BettyeMSmith @dbongino Maybe he doesn’t realize how utterly stupid y’all are. Talking about a constitutional process isn’t a coup attempt.
@dbongino I talk about the 25th amendment all the time. Am I trying to start a coup? Oh no, because I have no actual power to do anything, just like anyone not in Congress of the cabinet .
@SheriffClarke Why do you leave out that trump didn’t talk to them either?
@NightRanger232 @KurtenbachRon @SheriffClarke MS13 started in LA....

@ToddCopeland5k @MarkYoungTruth @realDonaldTrump Oh yeah, y’all claimed Sasha and Maleia weren’t their biological children. I could keep going.
@ToddCopeland5k @MarkYoungTruth @realDonaldTrump President Obama...he was called racist and hateful things for years. A certain Donald trump said he wasn’t even an American, a Muslim as if that was an insult), and illegitimate POTUS. His wife was called a man and a gorilla. So sit down with the victim playing for trump. https://t.co/B3InZaLXtL

@merrillgmccarty @chuckwoolery He alone can fix it! Remember. He doesn’t need help.
@Annenync @dogged46 @chuckwoolery Yes, he is a politician. The only requirement to be won is to seek or hold public office. What you are saying is he isn’t diplomatic. And that’s awful.
@chuckwoolery It’s ok, he said he alone can fix it chuck. He doesn’t need any help.
@TheRickWilson https://t.co/PHDmKzBgcA
@TomiLahren Honestly we don't give a shit. This kind of thing has been going on in conservative churches for decades. It's nothing new.
@oxxxx_y @KaitMarieox @thecjpearson LOL no one that is important wants to take your guns.
@silkyjay302 @KaitMarieox FACT: Trump was given a bill that allocated $25 billion for the wall. He turned it down because he didn't want to protect DACA recipients.
@JDiebler15 @LowLevelGeorge @KaitMarieox I think it's turning out that Trump is really bad at being president. And he isn't near as smart as he billed himself to be. Just saying.
@semi_full @KaitMarieox Are you ready to join a well regulated militia? That's part of 2A too. Ready to go to war for your rights? That's what 2A is about, state militias that would be ready to go to war for the US.
@Sandollar89 @KaitMarieox No one wants to take away your guns. Just make them more difficult to get so people who aren't safe with guns won't get them. Jesus.
@Patriotninjaz @TheByronPelton @8841mirror @KaitMarieox @thecjpearson This isn't an actual emergency though. Trump even said that himself today, "I don't have to do this, but I want to get it done faster." He failed as a deal maker with congress. He lied to you about everything.
@KaitMarieox @willchamberlain Please cite sources of where we have been trying to take your guns. We just want common sense reform to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. #2A isn't an unlimited right.
@chuckwoolery LOL the wall is socialism. The government is building a wall, and taking private property to do it.
@chuckwoolery Never heard of checks and balances? Trump's base isn't the majority. Congress is the  legislative branch (AKA the people's branch). They  are our reps. They are doing what we elected them to do in Nov 2018, stopping Trump.
@hise_jason @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump And y'all would be calling executive overeach. I mean, y'all did.
@timb5274 @Jim_Jordan Explain how it's a crisis, the drug bust he mentions was at a port of entry...a wall won't stop that.
@DianeNoMoreLies @whitepatrick @Jim_Jordan umm;...drugs make it through check points all the time....That's their main point of entry. Tell me how a wall will stop this?
@trevriffic @Jim_Jordan You sign your tweets? That's lame.
@Jim_Jordan @SaraCarterDC But ignore all the gun violence by American citizens? You ignore rape in your own state?
@Jim_Jordan @SaraCarterDC Hey Gym Jordan, it seems like CPB is doing it's job without a wall, that fentanyl was found at a border entry point, how would wall stop that? Caravans are people seeking asylum, under US law that is a legal thing to do. You are more worried about the few deaths by immigrants

Republicans: "It's a power grab to want a national holiday for voting!"		Also Republicans: "POTUS couldn't strike a deal for wall funding in his 3rd year in office so I guess he needs to by-pass congress and declare a national emergency. This is fine. https://t.co/Gi8lMVRv4G
@CherylSniggCor1 @SonOfAlgos @washingtonpost @ThePlumLineGS @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer There are smarter, modern, and more effective ways to implement border security. Dems are all on board for that. Plus, we have Trump $25 billion for the wall and he turned it down. How is this an emergency?
@mandy___11 @washingtonpost @ThePlumLineGS But this isn't an actual emergency, he is just making an end run around congress. The next Dem POTUS will do this for guns, climate change, healthcare. Way to self own Republicans!
@WayneDupreeShow @POTUS You realize he got a bill that gave him $25 billion for the wall but he rejected it right?

@TnBopinions @MattWalshBlog @willchamberlain To help them? You don't believe in helping the poor? Those in war torn countries? Because despite hateful racist people, we still want to help our fellow man.
@TwFar @MattWalshBlog @willchamberlain Because, despite our racism, it's still better than where they were. Do  you even think?
@OldDirtyPepe @brucewilson @MattWalshBlog Busting your bullshit link with this. https://t.co/GbCQyBGSnq
@OldDirtyPepe @brucewilson @MattWalshBlog Bringing "Black on black" crime is inherently racist. You are implying that they only have a higher crime rate because they are black, and not considering other factors.
@OldDirtyPepe @brucewilson @MattWalshBlog Before we discuss that, let's talk about white on white crime bro.
@RobDigweed @MattWalshBlog Racism is real bruh
@Texan__Pride @MattWalshBlog Because, even though we have a racist country, it's still better than living in a war torn / country with lots of gang violence. Have you considered that? Just because people come here doesn't mean we don't have areas where we can improve.
@MattWalshBlog /points to Steve King, Cindy Hyde-Smith, Roy Moore and all the support they received from Republicans. They are all three openly racist and two are in office and not opposed.
@guyrockfl @MattWalshBlog /points to current president and him leading the birther movement which was inherently racist. But ok. I mean he got elected too. I don't think presidential elections are a good indication of the level of racism in our country.
@MattWalshBlog @willchamberlain False equivalence here, you are saying the only evidence of racism is the crime rate? That's completely incorrect.
@jdawsey1 @washingtonpost I don't see how republicans can support such a blatant overreach of executive power (Something they complained about Obama doing) and taking private property. Isn't private property y'alls fav thing next to guns?
@theswampghost @willchamberlain I see you are still completely silent about the openly racist members of your party that keep getting elected. I can't say I'm surprised by that.
@mk3200 @washingtonpost Nah, Trump makes it pretty easy to go after him without anyone ordering it. It's pretty terrible.
@9roads @washingtonpost This makes zero sense. #ShartOfTheDeal
@ReppatrickRami1 @washingtonpost Really? A national emergency that took 3 years to declare? I don't think you understand what an emergency is.
@wolfvillage1984 @washingtonpost How is how anyone else lives effect how you live? No one is forcing you to live that way.

@dbongino LOL Amazon isn't union so I doubt that.
@WayneDupreeShow LMAO such a self own by the  Republicans.
@StopJeff1 @washingtonpost He’s not a king. And if it was an emergency why did he wait till his 3rd year in office to declare it? Why didn’t he take the bill that gave him 25 b for the wall?

@JohnMarte1 @chuckwoolery Depends on what area you are talking about. Here are world healthcare rankings. https://t.co/G78h84QzML
@JohnMarte1 @chuckwoolery I didn’t say we haven’t done good things. But it’s demonstrably true that we aren’t the best in everything. You can’t ride on our success in WW2 forever. We need to improve many things here and now. Why are you against that?
@JohnMarte1 @chuckwoolery Everyone can always be better. But you are just deflecting the conversation. We are talking about the country.
@SteveScalise Why do you care about this issue? Republicans basically leave children to die after they leave the hospital if their parents are poor.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Let’s be for real, y’all do an amazing job of looking bad on your own.
@AnnCoulter WHY YOU AND DADDY KEEP FIGHTING?

@AnnCoulter Are you just figuring out he lies? Like all the time? To everyone? Ann, we saw this back in 2015.
@JohnMarte1 @chuckwoolery We still have a long way to go on equal rights for women and minorities. We need to reform our justice / prison system. We rank 37 in overall healthcare. 17th in education. 1st in gun deaths. 1st in medical bankruptcy. So yeah, we aren’t the best in everything. We can do better.
@JohnMarte1 @chuckwoolery I’d argue that we aren’t the best country in the world in all aspects. Surely, many great things happen here, no doubt about that. However, there are also many areas we can improve. We should always be looking to improve ourselves. That quality is makes America great.
@JohnMarte1 @chuckwoolery Yup, I’m in Houston, TX. Born and raised. I’m also a prescient chair and election judge. Trust me, there is no amount of voter fraud that happens that effects the outcome of an election. It just doesn’t happen.
@JohnMarte1 @chuckwoolery So live how you want to? How is someone else living how they want change your life? Isn’t that what freedom is?
@HPpetition @KerryPicket @DailyCaller @realDonaldTrump National emergencies have to do with redirecting money, not changing law.

@chuckwoolery The wall is officially dead.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/8SGeenKJrE
@theswampghost @willchamberlain Well, those stats are exaggerated. Also, if it was such an emergency why did trump wait till his 3rd year in office to address it? You don’t schedule emergencies. Why didn’t he take the full wall funding when it was offered last year?
@theswampghost @willchamberlain The wall isn’t a national emergency either. So what’s your point?
@theswampghost @willchamberlain @SenHydeSmith Yup, they aren’t stepping down, and they should. You still haven’t defended y’alls racists who have been openly racists for decades. Well?
@theswampghost @willchamberlain @prageru Vox, while liberal leaning, abides by journalistic standards. They site sources etc. PU is just a conservative propaganda machine.
@theswampghost @willchamberlain You do realize as soon as a dem gets into office they will just declare an emergency for healthcare or the green new deal right?
@theswampghost @willchamberlain ok, i'll watch.
@theswampghost @willchamberlain LOL i did watch. It's garbage history and doesn't taken any nuance.
@theswampghost @willchamberlain What's your answer to Y'all keeping open racists like King and electing open racist like @SenHydeSmith? When our people come out as racist we demand their heads, y'all keep electing them. Why did y'all support Roy Moore?
@theswampghost @willchamberlain LMAOOOOO you are using @prageru as a valid source? Ok, who introduced the legislation for the Civil Rights act? JFK, a Dem. Which president got it passed? Johnson, a democrat.
@theswampghost @willchamberlain So? We already knew that.
@theswampghost @willchamberlain Yeah, he's racist too, but the dems immediately called for his resignation. Steve King has been racist for years and y'all keep electing him. What does that say about Iowa's republicans? Cindy Hyde Smith was openly racist BEFORE the election and still won.
@theswampghost @willchamberlain "“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” -Steve King Republican
@theswampghost @willchamberlain Yeah that was over 100 years ago and the parties switched in the 50's and 60's. The racists went to the republican party and are still there with y'alls support. See also, Cyndie Hyde Smith, proud racist. Roy Moore https://t.co/C0Bf8MHQav
@theswampghost @willchamberlain Yeah, cause what is Trump, cheated on three wives, rawdogged a porn star while FLOTUS was home taking care of their new born son? And you criticize a consenting relationship she had 30 years ago? Man, that is a stretch.
@theswampghost @willchamberlain LMAOOOOOO You mean like they did with Barak Obama? Our first, two term, black president? And wait, which party has Steve "You can't rebuild your society with other people's babies" King and aren't calling for his resignation? And WE are the racists? LMAOOOOOO
@benshapiro WOW, I agree with Ben Shapiro on something. #GreenNewDeal is on it's way via National Emergency. Great job Trump supporters, y'all just played yourselfs.
@AnnCoulter I mean...we tried to warn you he was terrible. Y'all didn't listen.
@theswampghost @willchamberlain She's a career prosecutor. She will eat him alive.
@theswampghost @willchamberlain I'm not shocked a conservative would call a woman a ho, not surprised at all. Have you ever seen her question someone? She's hard as hell. Now picture her debating "I have the best words" Trump. He'll crumble.
@theswampghost @willchamberlain If you think this won't go past his term in office you are crazy. https://t.co/BKUAbCzeZO
@theswampghost @willchamberlain Hearings for decades. We still have cases in the court from the GWB years. This will take longer than his presidency. Then President Harris will just stop the whole thing.
@theswampghost @willchamberlain Wait..first you said the court approved it, but now you say they can’t stop it? So does the court have power or not? And yes, a court can stop it, just like they stopped the first Muslim ban. And dude, the Texas border is mostly private property. We will have eminent domain
@AnnMarieReimers @charliekirk11 I discussed freedom of speech and women's suffrage today! Throw me in prison!

@TomiLahren Feminists are the best women to date.  They are strong, smart, and care about themselves. All of my best relationships have been with feminists.
@theswampghost @willchamberlain Well, you are completely wrong. "Monday’s ruling only affects DHS actions to repair or improve existing border fencing, not Trump’s proposals for a wall, The Hill reported."	https://t.co/R8lmF42tKx
@Dimplenut @willchamberlain Awww..you actually believe that huh? Wow. You realize POTUS can't just do that right? He can't appropriate money outside of the ED. That's congress's job and they haven't done that yet. Don't you know how our govt works?
@willchamberlain HAHHAHA This will get tied up in the courts longer than he will be POTUS and the next POUTS will just drop the emergency declaration and withdraw the case. The wall is dead.
@charliekirk11 You realize it will be in court longer than his term  of office and the next DOJ will just stop defending the case right? This is a win for the Dems. HAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAH https://t.co/M83VGC6IWc
@davidscassell @neosaket @kunolacarai @realtruthkings @AOC They drive up housing costs, Seattle now has the 3rd highest homeless population, many with college degrees. They cause a huge burden on the  education system and public  transportation systems. They have  fought the city on many occasions when they wanted to implement new taxes.
@ewest316 @BrinaBrady @DonaldJTrumpJr @JordanSchachtel 1. It wasn't a coup. The 25th is a Constitutional process and therefore lawful. 2.  It's not treason. For it to be treason congress has to have declared  war on another country and you have to aid or give comfort to the country we have declared war against. This isn't difficult.
@LisaPrealestate @ShaolinPhan @DonaldJTrumpJr @JordanSchachtel What's it like being so crazy?

@davidscassell @neosaket @kunolacarai @realtruthkings @AOC Seattle residents  HATE having amazon  there.
@davidscassell @kunolacarai @realtruthkings @AOC Corporate socialism is still socialism.
@dbongino LOL you  think  implementing part of the constitution is a coup attempt? They personally had no power to do it, they would have to get the Cabinet to agree.
@Jim_Jordan @DonaldJTrumpJr All republicans and appointed by Trump too. Imagine what they must know if they were that concerned. BTW, trying to implement a part of the constitution isn't "plotting". You got that Gym Jordan?

@FIREPROPHIL @SebGorka @realDonaldTrump You realize shutting down the government makes us much less safer than any security a wall would provide right? You want all air travel to stop?

@18244d7dfc66446 @AnnCoulter The military can’t act in policing capacity on US soil. That’s illegal.
@louiebunn @AnnCoulter Well, you have to purchase all that private property on the Texas border. That’s going to cost a lot. And will be in court for many years before construction starts. We are still litigating eminent domain cases from the GWB years.
@AnnCoulter It’s really expensive to keep white conservatives feeling safe from a false threat of poor brown people.

@Bill5Maria @RichCowboy4 @mitchellvii Well, we have been fucking over central and south America for about 100 years, plus the war on drugs damages their countries. The more foreign aid we send, the fewer immigrants come here. Lessening aid would just cause more to come here.

@chuckwoolery Wow, do you not understand political ideology. Progressivism and Socialism aren't the same thing. Even Medicare for all isn't socialism, because the government doesn't run the healthcare system. The VA is socialism.

@esaagar https://t.co/5XwFlsiWQC
@JohnMarte1 @chuckwoolery Lol I believe in helping people who need it. But being an immigrant doesn’t insulate your from criticism based off your beliefs and ideas. If you are an immigrant but don’t support others coming here too, you are pretty shitty.
@JohnMarte1 @chuckwoolery but so that no one will believe anything that puts him in a negative light. Is this the American dream you are talking about? If so it's pretty shitty and we can do much better than we are.
@JohnMarte1 @chuckwoolery People dying because they can't afford their insulin? Highest gun violence in the developed world? A president that attacks the 4th estate so that no one will believe it when he is criticized? BTW, he said that is why he complains about fake news, not because it's really fake
@JohnMarte1 @chuckwoolery What is the American dream? Giving the wealthy trillions in tax cuts while the middle class and poor pay for it? Having a nation with millions uninsured? Medical bankruptcies? A government working at making healthcare more difficult to get unless you're wealthy?
@DonaldJTrumpJr You are really bad at this.

@BamaStinson @wncbama @WayneDupreeShow I don’t know what the democrats have to do with this discussion. However, making claims like that requires some kind of evidence to distinguish it from your personal bias and feelings. I’ll take your dodge as proof you just made this up.
https://t.co/9tCmdHefCV
@DonaldJTrumpJr 1A says “And congress shall make no law:..” not “And Twitter shall make no law.” 1A restricts government, not private business.
@DonaldJTrumpJr What would you do if I went around to your properties and posted campaign signs and lit for democratic candidates? Would you leave the material up? Doubt it. I bet it gets thrown away. You’d be right to; it’s a private business. So are social networks.
@charliekirk11 Do you just make up stats all the time?
@jordanhenderson @g_berish @charliekirk11 Lmaooooo https://t.co/pxDyRThmQy
@mdcraw4d @charliekirk11 Nope, not even close.
@Iamsonotworthy @DonaldJTrumpJr Only if Congress has declared war in that country.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Coming from the family of gaslighting this is an ironic post.
@JohnMarte1 @chuckwoolery Our security is fine. Immigrants don’t really cause crime. That’s documents fact. Society receives a net benefit from them. I don’t judge a fellow human if they are worthy of help by where they were born. That’s arbitrary and selfish to do so.
@JohnMarte1 @chuckwoolery *person. And your way of life doesn’t deserve to persist.
@JohnMarte1 @chuckwoolery How great is America that we would cause poverty and violence in a foreign country and when the poor come here to see safety we arrest them, take away their kids, lose track of them, and send them away childless. You are proud of that? If so, you are very bad persoj
@JohnMarte1 @chuckwoolery That’s utterly ridiculous. It’s regressive. Our “great country” has been intervening in central and South American countries for the last 100 years and we are in large part responsible for the conditions for which these people are fleeing.
@JohnMarte1 @chuckwoolery Why do you get to define what being an American means? What makes you the authority? Why are you more important than anyone else? Guess what, you’re not. Your fellow humans are suffering and you decide if you want to help them based on where they emerged from a vagina.
@DonaldJTrumpJr But people I’m talking to are paying the same amount of taxes but are getting much less back or are paying thousands more.
@SNRIjohn I’m going to sleep. Look forward to the debate tomorrow. Be ready.
@SNRIjohn Fair enough. Looking forward to more debate with you. Let’s keep this line of discussion open.
@SNRIjohn And I am willing to look into this claim and see if there is data to back it up. I hope you do the same for any facts and evidence I present to you.
@SNRIjohn Also, to be transparent. You won’t see me caping for cops. I think cops are crooks and bastards.
@DanCrenshawTX @BetoORourke You are moving the goal post. Trump shutdown our government for over 39 days because he wanted a wall. Stop lying.
@SNRIjohn I have an idea, let’s use thoughts and prayers to protect our border, it seems to be enough for our schools.
@SNRIjohn @chuckwoolery Ok, I’ve already provided stats that refute your assertions. But ok.
@SNRIjohn https://t.co/yMBffXtxa7
@SNRIjohn What does this have to do with crime? US Law says seeking asylum is legal, a DOJ policy change can’t negate a law. Maybe we should imprison employers who hire undocumented persons. https://t.co/myP41LHnqZ
@SNRIjohn @chuckwoolery Ok, then provide proof. I’ll wait.
@SNRIjohn @chuckwoolery Stats say you don’t. https://t.co/G0n0eqcpi7
@SNRIjohn @chuckwoolery You’re just making stuff up based on how you feel. But our laws are different than your feelings and you are willfully ignoring the reality of how things are.
@SNRIjohn @chuckwoolery How do most undocumented persons come here?
@SNRIjohn @chuckwoolery I live in Texas. You’re lying. And there is no data that supports your claim. Again, facts don’t care about your feelings.
@SNRIjohn @chuckwoolery Crossing the border is a ticketable offense and isn’t my feelings, it’s just a fact. Anyone who commits morsel should be prosecuted for murder.
@DeceptionZombie @chuckwoolery But your hate for the poor is noted. Typical trump supporter. Only out for yourself.
@DeceptionZombie @chuckwoolery That’s not true. Just go read some history of our involvement in the region. We’ve been destroying them for years. And the war in drugs has been messing with them too.
@SNRIjohn @chuckwoolery Immigrants are less likely to commit crime than American citizens. The “murderers are pouring in” line is a huge lie. How mad do you get when right wing white men murder citizens in mass shootings? You get just as mad?
@Harlan @SNRIjohn @realDonaldTrump @BetoORourke https://t.co/YX6hDDG8dE
@Harlan @SNRIjohn @realDonaldTrump @BetoORourke This is a complete an utter lie.
@SNRIjohn @chuckwoolery Well, your feelings don’t have anything to do with the actual laws. Facts don’t care about your feelings. It is what it is. Die mad about it. What you want and what trump is doing is illegal and morally wrong.
@DeceptionZombie @chuckwoolery https://t.co/zxTE89yQ5n
@DeceptionZombie @chuckwoolery You seem really angry at poor people fleeing violence torn countries the US has been meddling with for the last 100 years. We caused the conditions that made them flee. And people like trump and you are spitting on them when they come here for safety.
@SNRIjohn @chuckwoolery Crossing the border illegally or to seek asylum isn’t a offense that the law prescribes jail for. So taking children is illegal and morally wrong. This isn’t selective outrage, it’s what is right. You are wrong here. Just because you don’t like it doesn’t change what’s real.
@SNRIjohn @chuckwoolery Do you feel people who get speeding tickets should have their children taken away? It’s the same level of crime as crossing the border and not seeking asylum. The state takes away children when all parents / possible care givers are not available.
@JohnMarte1 @chuckwoolery It’s not a offense the law perceives jail for. It’s just a civil fine. It’s like a speeding ticket. Why are you so angry poor people want a safer place to live?
@JohnMarte1 @chuckwoolery For the last 3 decades we have had a policy / laws that allowed these persons to seek asylum this way. It’s not open borders. They go through a process to qualify. Why are you so against helping the poor? Especially after we fucked up their countries.
@ChisToole @chuckwoolery Source. https://t.co/mvKyK6su7r
@ChisToole @chuckwoolery That’s is incorrect. US Law states you can cross between entry points for the purposes of seeking asylum. And the penalty for crossing the border without seeking asylum is a civil fine of at least $50 and not more than $250 per crossing. It’s like a speeding ticket.
@SNRIjohn @chuckwoolery having your children taken away. It's criminal and wrong what the Trump admin is doing.
@SNRIjohn @chuckwoolery I'm truly sorry that happened to you. It sounds very traumatic and awful. At the same time, your experience doesn't negate what our government is doing to people who are undertaking a totally legal process of seeking asylum. It's like you going to get a drivers license and
@ChisToole @chuckwoolery You don't have to but you can. It's totally legal.
@JohnMarte1 @chuckwoolery Jail them? For what? Seeking asylum.
@DeceptionZombie @chuckwoolery They came seeking asylum and we took their kids away.....don’t you see how that was wrong of us to do?
@SellinginS @chuckwoolery Asylum seeking isn’t illegal.
@Vinny73774928 @chuckwoolery Obama never took children away from them.
@555DeusVult @chuckwoolery They aren’t illegal and the US should stop fucking with their countries like it has the last 100 years so their countries can have a chance to be safe.
@PatrioticTiger @chuckwoolery Nah, they actually didn’t.
@CorinneMulhern @chuckwoolery They aren’t illegal.
@CorinneMulhern @chuckwoolery No, they came seeking asylum and that’s legal. It’s trump who decided to detain them and take their children away.
@coolbeans2004 @chuckwoolery Seeking asylum is legal.
@dugan_05 @chuckwoolery They aren’t illegal.

@JordanSharon @chuckwoolery They aren’t illegal.
@lksjackson @chuckwoolery Seeking asylum isn’t illegal
@jensterlynn @chuckwoolery It’s not illegal to seek asylum.
@SNRIjohn @chuckwoolery Were your children taken from you? Did the federal government then lose track of them and not return them? Then, no, no you can’t.
@reallycrystal @chuckwoolery It’s not illegal to enter with the purpose of seeking asylum.
@MGS9862 @chuckwoolery So?

@DarknetResearch How does his disability effect his policies and behavior as a congressperson?
It is in fact what you said but ok. You claim I'm attacking a disabled person. But I have never attacked his disability. I'm attacking his policies and behavior. Do you have equal ire for the face AOC accounts or any of the parody accounts on the left? https://t.co/zccph7ssU0
@DarknetResearch Dude, take a minute and realize you are arguing with a parody account.... Is this where you thought you'd be today?
@dementsententia Sir, this an internet parody account. You are taking things WAY too seriously. But keep it up, it's making me laugh lot!
@DarknetResearch Still waiting on how his disability makes him immune to criticism. I only attack his behavior since getting into office. His behavior isn't effected by his disability.
@MugsyDo @DanCrenshawTX @BetoORourke Proof they did?
TBH when I started this account I had a rule to never go after his lost eye. It's not worthy to go after and it's cruel. But attacking his behavior in office and his polices, totally on the table. Him losing an eye doesn't effect any of that. https://t.co/hNnjXf7f94

@DarknetResearch I think it's funny that you are being totally serious and I'm completely not. This is a comedy account. Also, waiting for you to show me that I attacked Dan's disability in any way, ever.

@DiamondandSilk We support those coming here for asylum, not an illegal thing. And those late term abortions are for non-viable or pregnancies when the mother's life in danger. It's also the rarest form of termination.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Ok, now do Steve King and Cyndie Hyde Smith.
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery @robreiner So as long as they are polite about it, it's totes cool? I see.
@chuckwoolery YAY!!! You solved a kindergarten "What do all these have in common" game!!! GOOD JOB!!!
@chuckwoolery Have you taken your meds today grandpa?
@chuckwoolery Wow, you sound like a Russian bot.
Freedoms aren't granted. They are inherent. 		"When Trump said, “We were born free and we will stay free,” the women remained seated — an ironic choice, given that they were dressed in white to celebrate women’s suffrage, one of the greatest freedoms granted to women in American" https://t.co/X1BWQsHFRh
@chuckwoolery Is that why you get so much attention too?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @DailyCaller Except all those meetings with Russians, Back channels with Russians, Manifort giving poll data to Russians. But yeah, no collusion.
@Soulcommander59 @DailyCaller Do you have that evidence of God yet? I'm still waiting.
@RaleighReporter Remember! There are fine people on https://t.co/pNp3R1HJGR!
Someone call the burn unit! @DonaldJTrumpJr is ON FIRE! https://t.co/Blq8nOQX7V
@benshapiro I join the RNC and will follow up with the Texas State Bar to make sure this goes through! #MAGA
Thank you for the support Keith! With Americans like you, we truly will #MAGA together! https://t.co/Yh5KSeawhk
@AOC20191 @Soulcommander59 @DailyCaller Except that is all wrong but . ok.
@Soulcommander59 @DailyCaller Care to share it?
@Soulcommander59 @DailyCaller That's the thing with religion, it's a bunch of stories and rules made up by people to control a population for one reason or another. Science is an evidence based questioning of our universe that contantly learns more.
@Soulcommander59 @DailyCaller lol there is zero evidence god exists and a multitude of evidence climate change exists. Man is changing the climate faster than it naturally would. Ignore the evidence at all our peril.
@WayneDupreeShow She can't handle how much #Winning is going on from President Leader Trump!
@DiamondandSilk OMG SQUEEEEE!!!!!! LETS BE SEATMATES AT THE NEXT SOTU!!!!!
YYYESSSS!!!! COME JOIN ME IN CONGRESS,  THAT OUTTA GO VERY WELL! Sorry, I just got really excited there for a second. When I get excited, I yell. https://t.co/bJsDzXxcxS
@BFT_Podcast Clearly it's time for us to believe polls, now that they say what we want to believe.
@chuckwoolery See, this time I believe the poll. Not like when they said @HillaryClinton would win the election. This one tells me exactly what I want to hear. #BlissfullCognitiveDissonance

Senate Leader McDonnell is correct. However, please don't look at his quotes or record prior to Jan 20, 2017. Or even some of it past then. #ITsComplicated #LifeIsKindaGray https://t.co/DOLCpCQSyt
@GovMikeHuckabee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump My favorite part of Trump's profile stance for born children is when he takes them from their families and puts them in cages and doesn't bother keeping records of whom they belong. He is truly #ProLife #ProFamily
Totally true! Especially with the family seperation policy. Trump is teaching these children right from wrong. Who cares if they ever see their parents again, they are learning a valuable lesson. Plus, they get to go live with a good white family instead. They actually have $. https://t.co/0D9dmgmy45
Check me out on MSNBC!!!!!! I'm on TV!!!!!! https://t.co/aH6O0hds6F
@jigsawdeal @IngrahamAngle No, just like President Leader Trump. It's a proven and effective method of punishment. This is the type of thinking we need these days. #Accountability
@TomiLahren @21savage I agree, my home state of Texas is being flooded with the illegals! That's why I ran for the congress to make laws and make it harder for people to come here. #BuildTheWall
@allahpundit @benshapiro I just got owned by logic and facts!!
Again, @BillOReilly is spot on. This economy looks really great for Trump. But please ignore all previous economic data prior to Jan 20, 2017. https://t.co/DR0ZdTfMfS

See, my colleague Steve King isn't racist! He took a picture with a black woman! A real racist wouldn't be caught in the same photo as a black person, because, ya know, all the racism. He totally owned the libs last night. https://t.co/5VGOi9PfYo
I for one was proud of President Leader Trump. https://t.co/pA94gK1JAn
I plan on introducing legislation to the congress punishing this type of behavior. Punishment will be to separate the children from the parents and lock them pu in cages then lose track of with whom they belong. #MAGA #Family #Prolife #1A https://t.co/FuVzkZbDFf
@IngrahamAngle I plan on introducing a bill into the Congress that will make this type of behavior illegal. Punishment will be to take the children from their parents and lock them up in cages and lose track of whom they belong.
As history books in my home state of Texas will tell you, the Democrats started the KKK and are a godless and racist party trying to destroy America from within with socialism. https://t.co/5HnO5aZVL6
Freedoms of speech don't apply when you have to salute the magic sky flag! This is unacceptable and is just indoctrination of socialism and hate for Trump. https://t.co/FuVzkZbDFf
See President Leader Trump is doing good things! Please ignore all economic and employment data prior to Jan 20, 2017. #SOTU https://t.co/aSoE5obCnG
I demand @AOC debate me on 70% tax  rates! Her views don't represent freedom and Americanness! I will use the truth of low taxes and limited government to prove that socialism is from satan! #GodBlessTheUSA
Bill is always totally on point with his observations about our current state of politics. He is right, President Leader Trump has to fight Nancy and Chuck now. It's time for the octagon! https://t.co/LpTlRq2MRn
Wasn't President Leader Trump the absolute best at the STOU last night? I got the clap so hard..;.I mean I clapped so hard for him! #SOTU
@ctgeezy @DailyCaller If by perfectly, you mean completely wrong, then yeah.
@Soulcommander59 @DailyCaller Weather is the day-to-day state of the atmosphere, and its short-term variation in minutes to weeks. weather is the combination of temp, humidity, precipitation, cloudiness, visibility, and wind. ... Climate is the weather of a place averaged over a period of time, often 30 years
@dbongino lol you blocked him after you said this you weak man. @TheRickWilson
#BuildTheWallAndBuildItTall
Businessmen make the best leaders of our country. President Leader Trump knows what he is doing. https://t.co/LQslZeGGC7
Like President Leader says, "If you don't have borders you don't have a country." He is very wise. #MAGA https://t.co/c1rJnKZAG0
@tedcruz I support this!
We cannot allow poor people from countries where we have been actively working at destroying their economies come here to seek asylum! I have the president's back on this and will introduce legislation changing our asylum laws soon! https://t.co/hitVpvijzg
