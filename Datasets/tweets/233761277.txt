@twright55 @AOC Despite what the non-scientists Al Gore, Tom Steyer and Hillary Clinton have claimed for years, CO2 is not a pollutant. Actually there is a counter-evidence to argue that CO2 is actually plant food. Oh wait a minute - that is a fact. Humans do pollute, especially outside the US
@twright55 Tatiana, there were rough seas, snow/ice storms, hot/cold days, even ice ages or massive ice melts, long before the use of fossil fuels or even man. Climate change has always occurred and will continue even if the Left gets their socialist Green New Deal. https://t.co/mYoP2nJgUT
