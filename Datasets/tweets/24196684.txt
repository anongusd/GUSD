It would have been more accurate to say, "Yes, your refunds are lower -- but so are your taxes! You're just mad because you didn't notice the lower taxes, and now you're acting totally crazy."
The withholding is different because they upended the tax code at the end of 2017 and didn't give the IRS any time to come up with a new withholding system.
The IRS expects fewer people to get refunds this year because fewer people withheld too much from their paychecks. And more people will OWE money because they withheld too little. It's a function of the withholding, not the amount of tax.
Top tax Republicans claim refunds are lower because taxes are lower, and it's just not true https://t.co/mWwqJZllUd

@JNicholsonInDC @KillerMartinis the more i think about it the more i think it is better to use a neutral &amp; accurate term that people will understand, like "food assistance" or "food aid" as @JNicholsonInDC suggests.		i'd thought those terms evoke international programs, but that may only be true of the latter
@KillerMartinis @JNicholsonInDC It's kinda funny that as they switch from actual stamps to the much simpler and easier debit cards, they gave it a much more difficult and complicated 12-syllable name.		One good reason for the change tho is that "food stamps" is loaded with racial connotations.
House ag chairman Mike Conaway praised the announcement -- even though he told me two months ago such a move would be unsatisfactory in lieu of passing his legislation. 		‚ÄúIt would not be satisfactory to the House,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have to change the law.‚Äù

@vivirescorrer if you have a lead service line and can't afford to replace it I would start by getting the water tested. use cold water and use filters, especially if there is a vulnerable person in the house, such as a child or someone pregnant
@vivirescorrer it's partial replacement that increases lead, which occurs when a utility cuts out the portion of pipe on public property but leaves the one running under someone's house or yard. Utilities sued in the 1990s so they wouldn't be forced to pay for the private part.

I am starting to think Mick Mulvaney just wanted to make people mad by saying cutting food stamps would be like giving poor people Blue Apron https://t.co/tNqxj4BcEl
Blue Apron tells me it has no comment on the America's Harvest Box proposal.
Mick Mulvaney is saying the existing food box program for seniors "does work" -- except that program is not a mass home delivery service.
Rep. Suzanne Delbene (D-Wash) is finally asking about the boxes.
"How is cutting food stamp benefits and sticking shelf-stable milk in a box at all similar to a gourmet meal delivery service?"		"Is the box it comes in the most distinguishing feature of a Blue Apron meal?"
@MarcGoldwein @mattyglesias With current SNAP benefits you could go to the store and put your food in a box. 		They are not serious about the delivery part. Didn't include money for it and the existing program used as a model mostly doesn't deliver.
So far, Budget Committtee Democrats in the House and Senate have had complicated questions for Mick Mulvaney instead of just asking him what on earth is up with the Harvest Box, the idea from nowhere that makes no sense.

America: not a family values country https://t.co/FgcNV2faAi
Like that time last year when Mick Mulvaney crapped on Meals on Wheels even though his budget didn't actually target the program, you have to wonder if he is just a really funny guy.
Not that they put much effort into actually making the proposal like Blue Apron. It'd be up to states how food boxes are distributed. Current food box programs like CSFP use nonprofits to distribute food through scattered sites, not necessarily home delivery.
Blue Apron delivers ingredients for gourmet meals, not cans of beans and shelf-stable milk.
Mick Mulvaney actually said the White House proposal to partially replace food stamp benefits with canned goods would make the program like Blue Apron https://t.co/UfMtuVDvaf
The USDA calls it "America's Harvest Box."
Instead of having $125 automatically deposited onto a food stamp debit card, some of that would be diverted to a box of canned goods for you to pick up at your local church.

I don't see what is supposedly damaging or dangerous about The Memo.
I never thought of Carter Page as an important part of the Trump Movement. 		I see why people said TheMemo is a pretext for something else.
My understanding of why the FBI is mad about this memo is that they feel they had good reasons to surveil Carter Page aside from work by the Trump-hating source.
Okay I have read the memo and would paraphrase it as saying that an FBI source, whose work was used to obtain a warrant on Carter Page, did not like Donald Trump.

@TPCarney @jbarro I guess we agree! As usual.
@TPCarney @jbarro No. A thousand bucks is an amazing amount of money. 		But that's a fake context. The real context is a $2 trillion tax cut that saved your company billions.
@TPCarney @jbarro Well some companies would pay more so that the after-tax amount still comes to $1,000 instead of $750 or so. 		BUT ANYWAY, what my tweet earlier tweet was about was the fake umbrage Republicans have taken in response to the "crumbs" counterpoint.
@jbarro @TPCarney We're not talking about a tax cut. We're talking about bonuses that Republicans are portraying as a windfall for workers, which Democrats have correctly pointed out are a fraction of corporate tax savings.
