@rmccue @Skyzyx  It's definitely not perfect, true. But the overall community benefits are worth it. That said, we inherited it, too. :)
@Skyzyx User freedom and developer proprietary ownership are not the same thing.
@DeputyMitchell Yes. It was Sunday. It's in the queue.
@Skyzyx The only thing the GPL restricts is taking away user freedom. Without the GPL, WordPress would not exist.
@jaxrafferty @Ermintrude2 If you mean @wordpressdotcom, please note that is a separate entity. But look under site stats, I think.
@WendyGoodman Pages do not have posts in them, just their own paragraphs. It sound like you want category archives as pgs, not WP "Pages".

@TriskalJM Auto-tweets are not part of core @wordpress. You're either on @wordpressdotcom, or using a plugin, so should check with them.
@theboysmama Then you might to start on @wordpressdotcom instead of self-hosted to get your feet wet (free support, extra features, etc).

@JessicaAmento Um, WordPress has no relation to Blogger.

.@AakashRaut Please be aware that the @wordpress_forum account is NOT really WordPress, but a fake.
@AakashRaut Sorry, plugin territory.
@AakashRaut B/c most people want it to show the published time, not the time it was written. You can backdate it: click Edit by pub time.
Happy Holidays! WordPress 3.1 RC1 is now available: http://wp.me/pZhYe-pU
@maramirou There's no such thing as a certified WordPress developer.
@Kalshassan Apology accepted, thanks!
@Kalshassan They're working on improving the app. Also, it's free.
@jenmartin Everyone. WordPress was born in Texas.
@frymaster Nice! Thanks!
@RestlessTweetin I don't know what you want help with. Please contact support. http://support.wordpress.com/
@williamblue 1. It's @wordpressdotcom. :) 2. Contact wordpress.com support for help, this takes more than 140 characters.
@feliciaday WordPress will never leave you; it's the beauty of open source!
@myndemayfield Not all plugins have options/settings, and some have more than one screen for them.
@DeejBeej It varies, depending on the translation volunteers. See http://cot.ag/f6TlCF for more info on Dutch.
@joelgoodman Maybe update to the beta 2 that came out last night?
@diabeteswarrior You should still have it in post revisions, then. Unless you accidentally moved to trash?
RT @WordPressiOS: Welcome to the family @WPWindowsPhone! http://wp.me/pf2B5-1wu
@trusttouch Which mobile platform?
@joelgoodman It's still there. Did you maybe drag it out of sight, or hide it with screen options accidentally?
@Krazy_Kris Think you meant @wordpressdotcom. :)
@maggiemmb That is not true. @wordpress has not been acquired by anyone.
@RestlessTweetin Given your domain, I think you mean @wordpressdotcom. @wordpress is the open source project.

@lee_garland Are you using Akismet?
@jhkoning Examples?
@LoSzabo That's plugin territory, so it depends on the plugin. Unless you meant to ask @wordpressdotcom, not @wordpress.
@emilyfitzhugh Sorry, not sure what your question is. Are you on @wordpressdotcom?
@CharlieThomason Not at all! Plenty of people have their sites hacked for failing to update. :)
@dohRG 3.1 Patches welcome. :)
@jaredatch Those were printed special for SxSW last year. We'll do more sometime.

@dominickevans What are you talking about?
@stevenhealey @babssaul @SarahArrow That site is violating the WordPress domain policy, though: http://wordpress.org/about/domains/
@mgpwr By the way, it's WordPress, not Wordpress. :)
@Josh_Max The intention of that feature is to allow for manual selection, so you'll want to look for a plugin.
@cherryoana No, thank *you* for using WordPress!
@powerhungryfilm If you mean http://www.facebook.com/wordpresstab, it's not from us. Also, they spelled WordPress wrong. :(
@StuartWooster Like the blog post says, flat rates are temporary while we work out better integrated shipping. Patience.
@powerhungryfilm FB tab?
@MarieDouville You should probably try the support forums for the plugin.
@anandgraves Nope. You can add define('WP_POST_REVISIONS', false); into wp-config.php to turn them off.
@MarieDouville Help is available at http://wordpress.org/support
@dimensionmedia Yes, we sold an insane number when the store opened. Will be reordering asap.
@ryan_burns Yes, it is.
@ldebrouwer Agreed. Hopefully they will come down when we get live shipping set up instead of having to do flat rates.
@fritzvonrunte For now, we'll only use coupons for WordCamp stuff. There's not much markup here, so there's not a lot of room for sales.
https://wpswagstore.com/ has just launched. Run by @automattic, it helps offset the cost of WordPress swag they send to WordCamps for free.

@mediamake That's orange, not red, & is from our previous website design. Yes, @wordpress is the official account for the open source proj.

@katiejbaugh Hi Katie. @wordpressdotcom is the Twitter account you should use for this. @wordpress is for the open source project.
@workingmomfence Your comments may be getting moderated to spam b/c of links, or site owner settings. WP itself doesn't mark as spam.
@iamAlberto Good luck!
@thekacikoolman5 Please try the support forums & provide your browser/hosting info instead of just swearing at us. :)  http://cot.ag/97iG6O
@kouroshp (You can still password-protect posts, though.)
@kouroshp Sorry, still plugin territory in 3.0.
@Borror0 Ah. Yes, @wordpressdotcom is where to go. Or for a quicker response, try the support forum over there.
@shayatik Sometime in May, most likely.
@cballou @_wpn Mark_r just spent many hours flying from UK to SF for annual WordCamp SF. Let's cut him a day or two of catching up slack. :)
@Oujiz You might want to go to http://wordpress.org/suport for help troubleshooting this.
@Borror0 What version are you using?
WordCamp SF has released its schedule for this Saturday: http://2010.sf.wordcamp.org/schedule/ It's not too late to get tickets!
Were you sleeping before? WordPress 3.0 bug hunt/patch marathon/code sprint. Whatever you call it, we need your help! http://wp.me/p4Ez4-lq
@lewayotte Colloquy if you're on Mac. Maybe XChat if you're on PC.
@iJohnsonPR That's kind of the point: we need more contributors so we can fix the bugs in a timely manner.
WordPress 3.0 bug hunt/patch marathon/code sprint. Whatever you call it, we need your help! 200+ bugs left to fix! http://wp.me/p4Ez4-lq
@safirulalredha Thanks for reporting, have passed to the plugin repo team.
@PaulLomax Maybe you meant for this to go to @wordpressdotcom?
@adamleben Hi Adam. You should contact support. Also, @wordpress is for the open source software, @wordpressdotcom is for your hosted site.
@jsgraph You should direct this to @wordpressdotcom.
RT @WordPressTV: The sessions you missed from WordCamp Boston - #jQuery, #HTML5, security, and more: http://wp.me/pmhq1-2j #wcbos
@TheFrosty Email plugins@wordpres.org and Mark will look into it.
@Zamostny Thanks for contributing!
@ScottSwezey If you're logged in you should be able to change it on your profile page.
@sjwilliams Contrary to their EULA, "source code incorporated" does, in fact, equal "derivative work" under the English definitions. :)
@BoltClock @wordpressdotcom has its own themes, but agreed, they should have table styling. Will put a bug in their ear. (Still, language!)
@Protegebranding Sometime in May. Earlyish, hopefully.
@feliciaday BuddyPress=WordPress-powered community in a box. & there's a Ning importer. Let us know if you need some help, we like you. :)
@LabSecrets: #Ning to #BuddyPress importer now updated to support user and profile data import, if you're self-hosting: http://bit.ly/c8ZzF7
@aqmme I think you mean @wordpressdotcom. :)
@LightAnalytics If you mean on @wordpressdotcom, no, plugins aren't allowed. WP on your own hosting = any plugins you want.
@MultiplyLeaders No trouble! We're all newbies at some point. :)
@MultiplyLeaders http://cot.ag/cIUKCJ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_post
@LincolnBarbour Short answer? Yes.
@anthonyprice You should try the support forums: http:wordpress.org/support
@_ambrose I would guess it's the survey plugin. Maybe ask in the support forums?
@SoulReservoir You found the easter egg! Comparing a post revision to *itself* gets you that screen. No worries, nothing was broken. :)
@musicofourheart We have an iPad app for managing your blog. Your theme will determine how your actual site looks on an iPad.
Don't believe the hype going around about a WordPress vulnerability. Here's the real story: http://wp.me/p4Ez4-lk #accuracyinreporting
Application deadline for GSoC is in 3 hours. http://wp.me/p4Ez4-lh
RT @wpgsoc: 1.5 days left to submit GSoC proposals. If you're still not sure what to do, check the updated Ideas list: http://bit.ly/cXDnC8
@Nikitanov Because not everything belongs in core. :)
@tommygeorge Report it to the wp-testers list. Join from an email address that's not personally identifiable if you're afraid? :)
@gubatron I think you meant to send this to @wordpressdotcom, not @wordpress (which is for the open source dev project).
@mzungu777 If that's your support page, you should be asking @wordpressdotcom. @wordpress is the open source dev project.
@dancingtoe Do you mean to be asking @wordpressdotcom?
@jianchung You can get help in the forums at http://wordpress.org/support
@Nikitanov There is a great plugin: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tinymce-advanced/
@GrantGriffiths It's not about being important, it's about the organizers officially asking individual people to come. :)
@HipMom That's not enough info to troubleshoot. Head over to http://wordpress.org/support (where you get way more than 140 characters).
@NickoCP If you don't understand, then don't worry about it. It's code stuff.
@markmapstone There's no mailing list mentioned. That post is just about our twitter account.
@MRNayak 3.0 is an early beta. 2.9.2 is the latest stable version.
@RKTweets I think you meant to send this to @wordpressdotcom?
We may need a jQuery expert who's very familiar with WP core to help mentor a GSoC project. If interested, please email jane/wordpress/org.
3.0 is just the number that comes after 2.9, folks.
@MYIL1 This will help you, then: http://en.support.wordpress.com/publicize/
@MYIL1 But are you on wordpress.com or self-hosted? That will determine where I send you for support.
@MYIL1 Do you mean using the Publicize feature? On wordpress.com or on a self-hosted blog with the Publicize plugin?
@ryancduff First entry on the hackers list!
@cotweet_support Thanks! Am just going back and forth between CoTweet & Twitter.com right now to get around it.
@eldestmuse That sounds like plugin territory, since it's such a specific workflow. Try the forums at http://wordpress.org/support/
@Chris_Kasten Done. You're first. :)
@boonzeet You asked yesterday. Over 1000 requests, we just released 3.0 beta, and it's a holiday weekend! A little more patience, please.
@Chris_Kasten Hm. Hacker? Contributor? New list - Volunteers? What do you think? Suggestions?
@frgdr You've got a fauxgo here: http://cot.ag/cV6onl You can get real WP logos at http://wordpress.org/about/logos/
@mickejamtsved We don't like to brag....  If you're able to set up a test site to try out 3.0, you'll have fun playing with it.
New Twitter approach: going to make more lists. Are you a WP: user/blogger, hacker (pro/hobby), core contributor, plugin dev, or themer?
@randyhoyt Are you a WordPress: user/blogger, hacker (pro/hobby), core contributor, plugin dev, or themer? (Making new Twitter lists!)
@Adomatica http://codex.wordpress.org/Importing_Content#Blogger
@frederick030 http://support.wordpress.com should be a good place to start.
@thoughtsondatin You should really put a link to your web site in your Twitter profile.
@RFosta Sorry, what do you mean by message? You should ask at http://wordpress.org/support, where you get more than 140 characters. :)
@4evamamii Lots of info here: http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page  Also recommended: WordPress for Dummies by @LisaSabinWilson.
@ErisDS Would you call yourself a WP: user/blogger, hacker (pro/hobby), core contributor, plugin dev, or themer? (Making new Twitter lists!)
@CaseyTrowbridge Thanks! If you find anything we could do to make screen reader accessibility better, please let us know.
CoTweet shows people following us in profiles, but won't let us DM those people b/c it says they're not following us, which isn't true. Bug!
@devongovett What platform? We have a rich text editor in regular WordPress, but not in mobile platforms that don't have it yet.
@leewillis77: Checked out your site. WordPress has a capital P in the middle. :)
@chriseverson :)
@indieradiochatt Change status from local draft to published, then Save.
@declanmar What's the question?
@Adomatica Well, if you use Akismet anti-spam on WordPress, it usually blocks 99% of spam.
@indieradiochatt Change status to Published (from local draft) and hit Save. We're looking for a better way, but the iPhone OS has rules. :)
@frederick030 You might be meaning to ask @wordpressdotcom.
@RFosta Virtually nothing. You'll click the upgrade button and you should be fine. (Back up first, of course, as always.)
GSoC Mentor chat in #wordpress-gsoc at irc.freenode.net starting any minute.
@randyhoyt It's been fixed the program takes a while to update. Sorry for the inconvenience.
@cfgriffith We can get in touch with the theme author.
@cfgriffith Your theme has a fake WP logo & "Wordpress" instead of "WordPress" in the footer. Might want to have your theme guy fix it.
@anaspicegirl Wrong twitter account. You need to use @wordpressdotcom for that. @wordpress is for the volunteer open source project itself.
@mattyza Here, directions written just for you! (And anyone else who asks.) http://wp.me/pbNCB-bC
@nietdanNL We released the beta after the nightlies went out. It should update tonight.
@JulsGarces I suggest joining the WordPress NYC meetup group and asking there, they'll know. http://www.meetup.com/wordpressnyc/
@mattwiebe Long live the GPL! :)
@anaspicegirl I'm sorry, I don't know what "Is there how to become inactive a worpress account?" means.
@johanbrook It's where you reply to a comment someone has left on your site. If you want to contribute to the app dev, http://cot.ag/cdDJZm
@mickiedivafan69 http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tags/captcha
@robertson_n Thanks, fixed link. It was the period being carried into the link.
@acheron Yes, please don't put the beta on a live/production site. Our betas are for testing only, and could break your site!
@mattyza For the admin menus? Yep. [icon_url] when you add_menu_page. http://codex.wordpress.org/Adding_Administration_Menus#Top-Level_menu
@LittleCoding Don't forget all those shiny new iPads running the WordPress app!
@12circles Not sure what you mean by help corner. The support forums? We don't work with byethost, so you should ask the byethost for help.
@12circles You need more than custom menus, custom post types, multisite capabilities, new default theme, custom background, etc? Greedy. :)
Did you go out on the town last night and miss the news? WordPress 3.0: beta, beta, beta! http://wp.me/p4Ez4-l1
@verso AND the WordPress app!
@laurentlasalle Yes.
@MikePerry Dude. Thousands of people asked to be refollowed, we just released beta 1 late last night, & we have to sleep sometime. Patience.
@Pedal We have an importer just for Blogger. :)  http://codex.wordpress.org/Importing_Content#Blogger
@musicofourheart We don't have a mailing list for Twitter. By following us, you get all our Twitter updates in your stream.
@sbrinkmann Using plugins, just as MU does currently.
@markmapstone ? What mailing list?
@lingvistperevod You should only use the beta on a test site, not your live one.
@mattbrett Is Saturday bad? We deliberately released the beta Friday so people who work could play with it over the weekend.
@Nikitanov We have a new icon, it just hasn't been added yet. Beta, remember? A handful of UI tweaks and fixes are still to come.
@ikbenmartijn If you find a bug, email the testers list to report it so other testers can try to reproduce before creating a Trac ticket.
@RFosta MU is merged into 3.0.
WordPress 3.0 Beta 1 is now available. Beta, beta, read all about it!  http://wp.me/p4Ez4-l1
@frederick030 WordPress is an open source application used by over 20 million people worldwide, not really an individual.
@jeanniebeannie Sorry, we decided to sneak in an awesome new custom menu system at the last minute! Beta coming soon.
@joelhaus You just did it. Reply to a tweet with @twitterusername. "@ reply."
@tracyzhangphoto Congrats! You should follow @wordpressdotcom.
@developdaly And now we'll be singing Phil Collins all day. Thanks. Thanks a lot, Patrick.
@verso You're in like Flint.
@CalvinF Upgrade party for 3.0? :)
@nathanrice Re-added. Play nice. :)
@Chris_Kasten Thanks for all your work in the forums!! (Re-followed)
@jeherve Some people seem to think they won't get @wordpress updates if we don't follow them back. Weird.
@UniqueThink You get updated if you follow us, not the other way around. :)
@Smashguy http://wordpress.org/development/2010/04/tweet-tweet/
@timtfj Yes! @wordpressdotcom for all your .com love (and announcements, etc).
@xentek We'd already re-followed you! :)
Did we unfollow you last night/this morning and freak you out? Sorry! Check out why: http://wp.me/p4Ez4-kV
@iammattthomas It looks fantastic.
WordPress for iPhone OS 2.4 is now available, with a whole new design for the iPad. Check it out!  http://wp.me/pgi3r-ai
@ric_harvey Where did you see that? What URL?
@chriseverson Making plugins, you mean, not overwriting core files, right? "My hacks" went out of style years ago! :)
@orlandot Try http://bit.ly/cCsF3S
@ssmediaco Nope. :)
@joshicsin Students only, sorry.
@fffabulous Nothing to do with us, we swear.
@DanBowles It's not WordPress, it's your theme, which is not good. Here's a fix: http://cot.ag/apvx4u
@Janerri Shoulda asked Matt! :) No JS allowed on wordpress.com. Also, wrong twitter account. For future reference: @wordpressdotcom.
If you want to keep up with ongoing news/announcements about WordPres and GSoC, please follow @wpgsoc. Students, this means you! Thanks! :)
5 GSoC applications on day one (which didn't start until 3pm).  11 more days to go! http://bit.ly/aYfM2n
@BuellaMarie You need to edit the actual theme file.
