#amreading The Whole 30: the 30 day guide to total health and food freedom by Melissa and Dallas Hartwig. I am on Day 6 of gluten,carb, dairy &amp; sugar-free plan. So far, clear skin, better energy &amp; I feel really good. Hoping for better health.
#amreading An Unkindness of Magicians by Kat Howard. Great read for mature YA, specifically fantasy lovers who prefer the idea of another magical universe in a contemporary setting (NYC). Nonstop action, intrigue, revenge, suspense. Loved this.
At the end of "A Quiet Place", as I peeled myself out of my "cowering in my seat" mode, my daughter turned to me and asked, "What kind of guy knocks up his wife during an apocalyptic situation?" Thank god for her. üòÜü§£üòÇü§£ü§£

@MolleeBranden Ready for the sequels of Caraval and The Bear and the Nightingale. #YearofYA
A2: We need to be confident in the real world, and I feel it is important for all of us to be role models. YA and literature mirrors our world in creating strong females who ate also role models and heroines for us to look up to.  #YearofYA
@MolleeBranden A1: I read Caraval by Stephanie Garber also! Sorry I forgot in first tweet. #YearofYA

The kind of movie that makes you think about how you can  help other people and make the world a better place.  @LionMovie
That's the kind of movie that makes you think your heroes really could be doing a better job saving the world instead of wasting their time and money on trivial pursuits. @LionMovie

@beckyksu @ncte @ProjectLITComm Sometimes I think kids seek out the high interest titles they want and I want to bring these to them.
@beckyksu @ncte @ProjectLITComm And I am not sure what level you are but a couple of my students read The Heroin Diaries outside of school but when I asked if I should have in library, they look at me uneasily but they read it at home. Thoughts?
