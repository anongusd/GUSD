#MomsDemand &amp; #MarchForOurLives activists, who flew in from across the country, were watching from the gallery, crying + confused.		I ran up to them *during the vote* and explained that the gotcha amendment pinned gun safety against immigration advocacy. Its intent was to divide.
What I DID say was that I had to go back to my district &amp; share the MTR vote to explain why a pro-ICE amendment was slipped into a gun safety law.		Maybe they‚Äôre mad bc I don‚Äôt believe pro-ICE expansion votes should be cast in the dark, and people deserve to know what happened.

And part of what the #GreenNewDeal says, at last, is that Flint wasn‚Äôt an accident.	The folks dying in West Virginia aren‚Äôt an accident.	The Bronx having one of the highest child asthma rates isn‚Äôt an accident.		It‚Äôs a structural failure to care, &amp; treat these communities fairly.
The pipes in Flint weren‚Äôt a market failure, they were a social failure.		It was a failure to see the people in Flint as important as the WH. Those decisions were predicated on a legacy of racism + dehumanization of the poor.		The enviro issue of water is how that was expressed.
For far too long, ideas like a carbon tax or cap-and-trade were touted as the premier solutions to climate change.		While those things could be *part* of a solution, the GND resolution says they are inadequate as the whole answer.		The pipes in Flint weren‚Äôt a ‚Äúmarket failure.‚Äù
‚ÄúClimate change is not a market glitch to be fixed through pricing... but part of a dire social crisis.‚Äù		The GND Resolution‚Äôs purpose is to *define the scope* of a climate solution.

It does not mean the treatment + presumption of guilt before a verdict. It does not mean we aim for the most punitive punishment.		It means that in the eyes of the law, we treat everyone the same.		That‚Äôs far from what our current system does. And that‚Äôs why it must change.
As a result, our system is ‚Äúinnocent until proven guilty‚Äù only for the rich &amp;‚Äúguilty until proven innocent‚Äù for the poor.		To borrow from @ZephyrTeachout, the RADICAL rule of law is the idea that in the same scenario, our courts would treat a billionaire the same as a Bronx teen.

It‚Äôs a huge win. Obviously there is work to do - there are other money committees (Ways &amp; Means, Energy &amp; Commerce, etc). But we‚Äôve got one down. Before we had 0.		Keep paying attention, chipping into campaigns, and being activists. It works.
I cannot stress how important this moment is.		Dems are putting members who rejected corporate campaign money on a committee overseeing Wall St.		All because: 	1. Everyday people donated to our campaigns, and	2. They started to pay attention + became activists in Congress
These legislators, under public pressure, couldn‚Äôt deliver as much for big bank lobbyists.		They had to vacate one of the most powerful committees in the House. That made a space that big banks couldn‚Äôt fill, and how we got *several* non-Corp funded members into places of power.
All of a sudden, it became harder for legislators to slip corporate-friendly legislation through committee, because people would write articles and their constituents would find out and grow upset.		As I‚Äôve said before, it‚Äôs People vs Money. We‚Äôve got people, they‚Äôve got money.
All of a sudden, normal people whose student loans were bubbling, whose mortgages were underwater, and so on, started showing up to committee hearings.		Including this guy: Monopoly Man		The idea was to show legislators that everyday people were watching.	https://t.co/YU4Bw8P1Sg
Fin Services is one of few exclusive committees.		The jargon around here is that they are the ‚Äúmoney committees,‚Äù not bc they oversee money,but bc one can fundraise from special interests by sitting on it and giving corporations a listening ear.		Until people started paying attn.
Activists zoomed in on one place in particular: the Financial Services Committee, which deals with big banks, real estate, and almost every interaction people have in dealing with their own money.		What they found was a place where big bank lobbyists were slipping in their work.
During + after the 2008 financial crisis, everyday people started to viscerally see the corrosive role of lobbyists writing in legal loopholes that allowed big banks to gamble with people‚Äôs lives and the economy as a whole.		Occupy Wall Street emerged, and activism bloomed.

It *must* be said in a nuanced conversation that questioning where takes come from is nowhere near the same as undermining the extraordinary work reporters and journalists do as ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù		Helping people understand where these takes come from help guard against those attacks.
@GlennKesslerWP @washingtonpost I‚Äôm not challenging that I was checked - I think the check is a very fair one to masked, and that the coverage illuminated the issue far more than my tweet did. 		I *am* confused by the equivalence of the check to other similarly-rated claims that seem much more severe.
Fact-checking is critically important. It‚Äôs not always fun. But that‚Äôs okay! It pushes me to be better.		It‚Äôs important that if fact-checkers are referees, everyone know the rules - and those rules be as clear + fair as possible for all to play.		Thank you for the work you do. https://t.co/LGfd6pOReX

Or why did @washingtonpost give my confusing tweet on military accounting offsets the same ‚ÄúPinocchios‚Äù as Trump‚Äôs flat denial of how many Americans died in Puerto Rico?		These are legitimate questions not intended to attack. Who makes these decisions? How? Is there a rubric?
For example, it looks like @PolitiFact has fact-checked Sarah Huckabee Sanders and myself the *same* amount of times: 6.		She‚Äôs been serving for almost 2 years. I‚Äôve served 4 days.		Why is she fact-checked so little? Is she adhering to some standard we don‚Äôt know about?
Facts are facts, America. We should care about getting things right. Yet standards of who gets fact-checked, how often + why are unclear.		This is where false equivalency+bias creeps in, allowing climate deniers to be put on par w/scientists, for example.	https://t.co/87c6kVzIuI

We need to focus on good healthcare, living wages, affordable rent. Corporations that offer none of those things should be met w/ skepticism.		It‚Äôs possible to establish economic partnerships w/ real opportunities for working families, instead of a race-to-the-bottom competition.
Displacement is not community development. Investing in luxury condos is not the same thing as investing in people and families.		Shuffling working class people out of a community does not improve their quality of life.
When we talk about bringing jobs to the community, we need to dig deep:	- Has the company promised to hire in the existing community?	- What‚Äôs the quality of jobs + how many are promised? Are these jobs low-wage or high wage? Are there benefits? Can people collectively bargain?
Amazon is a billion-dollar company. The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here.

@SkylarJordan Agreeing - saying that PR and Appalachia actually share quite a bit in common. Yet we don‚Äôt question Appalachia‚Äôs US status as conditional based on an assessment of its economic value. PR is treated differently because of its colonial history &amp; modern day colonial status.
It is revealing that this question:		 a) comes from quite the colonial mindset of ‚Äúwhat value is this territory providing us anyway?‚Äù (Do we ask that about Appalachia, etc?)		b) implies that PR‚Äôs current status is somehow an act of charity - also a sentiment rooted in colonialism

Medicare for All (H.R.676) has been on the floor of Congress since 2003. The bill is 15 years old.		A stream of studies from both the left and right have shown both the funding mechanisms &amp; immense cost savings of a Medicare for All system.		Almost every modern nation has one.

When I talk about @CoriBush, @ZephyrTeachout, @LinseyFaganTX &amp; other incredible candidates, it‚Äôs because I know them. I have met them. They are knockout leaders. And they helped me when I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúviable‚Äù either.		We must have the courage to MAKE viability, not WAIT for viability.
There‚Äôs a vicious cycle between lack of perceived ‚Äúviability‚Äù and willingness to support.		If you‚Äôre not willing to support a candidate with time or a few dollars, then that candidate isn‚Äôt ‚Äúviable.‚Äù But too often, we wait for a candidate to be ‚Äúviable‚Äù before we do those things.
For my entire race, I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúviable‚Äù enough for any established groups or people.		I had all the numbers. We shared the ‚Äúperfect storm‚Äù factors. And we had already knocked on tens of thousands of doors *by JANUARY.*		We need to look at more than just $ to determine viability.
There‚Äôs a secret little word used to dismiss political candidates: ‚Äúviability.‚Äù		I want these women to at least have a shot, to be seen as legitimate - because they are.		Ultimately, what makes a candidate viable is our individual choice to believe in them.https://t.co/ifkK4NYIyK

@ShaunKing Thank you for understanding that this win is all due to organizing and the message.
This is the start of a movement.		Thank you all.
We triggered the first primary election in 14 years. OUR supporters, collecting signatures in the bitter snow for 5 weeks, did that.		No matter who the vote is for, every single vote cast to day is ours - because we made this election happen.
But I knew that in refusing to engage with non-voters, we were churning a cycle of neglect and cynicism.		So I reached out. And we have been embraced. We have built power. We have organized.		What we have built is permanent. No. Matter. What.
Today I saw people voting that are almost never seen in an off-year midterm primary.		Just now, as I‚Äôm typing this with 8 minutes left, two young men of color, 20 years old, just walked up to me and said they just voted.		2 yrs ago, the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù told me not to bother with them.
I have spent today criss-crossing the district my family has called home for generations. I have met strangers who knew my dad, and knew stories about my loved ones.		I have touched the hands of people who have felt ignored and invisible for a long, long time. And they felt seen.
Almost two years ago, I started what was then a completely ‚Äòimpossible‚Äô bid for Congress.		Since then, everything has changed.		Now, there‚Äôs only 20 minutes left.		And it feels great.

Many of the young people I worked with came from El Paso and other border cities like McAllen and Laredo.		I remember their stories of home: making shopping trips across the US-MEX border to get treats and head back before dinner.		The border was a casual fact of life. /2
As an Educational Director w/ @nhi_news, I worked with 1000s of kids of all statuses: US citizens, residents, DREAMers, undocumented youth.		They came to us from fruit farms and street blocks. Some came from privilege, too.		They were all incredibly gifted. I‚Äôm going for them. /1 https://t.co/UdfBptTXJJ

My opponent has already spent $3 million dollars, and raised more üí∞ from GOP lobbyists this week.		Yet our field conversions are through the roof. We can win this, but ONLY if people (+ organizers) come this weekend.		People don‚Äôt know there‚Äôs an election: 3% turnout district. https://t.co/M2czII8BwI
When I started this race, I pretty much did everything they told you not to do: I engaged non-primary voters, young people, poc, people w/o college degree. 		Because that‚Äôs what organizers do.		I refuse to accept that 97% of New Yorkers are ‚Äúnon-voters.‚Äù We are changing that NOW.
An ORGANIZED electorate is far more powerful, because a purchased electorate does not engage.		ORGANIZED electorates win midterms and build power. Purchased electorates remain expensive and don‚Äôt push for change in the off-season.
What we desperately need right now are fierce advocates for economic, social, and racial justice.		Experienced new candidates that present new ideas - Abolish ICE, a Fed Jobs Guarantee - to influence National discourse and ORGANIZE the electorate, not BUY the electorate.
Red to Blue is critically important. But many Red to Blue Dems will always have pressure to be moderate so they can keep their seats.		Safe Blue Dems should be charting the most ambitious visions and ideas for future.		Instead, they are raking in Republican lobbyist cash.
Incumbent Democrats voted to create ICE.		Incumbent Democrats voted to gut Dodd-Frank before passing.		Incumbent Democrats voted to lower the Federal minimum wage in Puerto Rico to $4.25/hour.		We need to change the Democratic Party because that is what we CAN change.
We cannot afford to stay the course and elect the same exact leadership over + over.		People ask me, ‚ÄúHow do you plan to change the party?‚Äù		Can‚Äôt be me. WE have to ELECT a new Democratic Party - one that fights doggedly for working class Americans and stands for the vulnerable.
We need to talk about the future of the Democratic Party.		We are at a crisis point in our country.		If we continue to vote for the same leadership &amp; tactics that lost us 1,000 seats, the House, the Senate, AND the Presidency, we will continue to be a nation in decline.

@tomwatson @NatalieElsberg Census doesn‚Äôt include/Hispanic when they ask race, so Latinx people largely check ‚Äúwhite,‚Äù also ‚Äúnative‚Äù and ‚Äúblack.‚Äù		This is demographics 101. Also a reason why looking up stats without stepping into a community doesn‚Äôt give the full picture. Community has also changed a LOT.
@tomwatson When we say ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no point‚Äù in bringing in natl figures, then communities like ours say ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point‚Äù to mobilizing.		Attitudes like this, saying certain communities aren‚Äôt worth national attention bc the ‚Äústrategy‚Äù doesn‚Äôt add up is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
@tomwatson The goal is for communities in the BX &amp; Queens to actually be seen, valued, and invited to mobilize in 2020 instead of being ignored, dismissed, and taken for granted by the national party.		Asking ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point‚Äù in caring about the Bronx, Queens, etc is the problem. /1
And listen - campaigns need funds to operate. That‚Äôs just a fact. We need resources to print literature, get an office, have organizers, etc.		But you don‚Äôt need to get it from corporations. It‚Äôs HARD to organize clean + ethical funding. But it‚Äôs worth it &amp; much more powerful.
This is an excellent point about corporate Dem refusal to reject Corp lobbyist money. In taking this stance, you‚Äôre following the GOP‚Äôs lead.		That‚Äôs the opposite of leadership. At its core, it‚Äôs a fear-based position that doesn‚Äôt understand the power of grassroots organizing. https://t.co/USJTIpHZ3k

@JarekFA @BrooklynPortage @Naparstek @StreetsblogNYC Hey @JarekaFA,		I don‚Äôt own a car. I‚Äòm from the Bronx. Here bikes are far too dangerous. Even most delivery folks don‚Äôt have them. Underserved communities like ours are usually the last to get investments. I need you to work with me,instead of judge me, if we‚Äôre going to improve.
Alright y‚Äôall. Obviously this is a heated issue. And I don‚Äôt even own a car.		Perhaps we do a sit down at my office on federal transportation policy.		Open to all &amp; I‚Äôm more than willing to learn and grow. That‚Äôs the benefit of not taking special interest funds.
RT @saieedkhalil: @HuffPostPol I'm so excited to be writing postcards for @Ocasio2018 !
@radlerkoenigin Come to our office and let‚Äôs talk about it! Transportation is a highly intersectional issue and I‚Äôd love to see how we translate transport justice to a federal level.
@ohhleary My apologies for stating this in boiled down 280 chars - basically local folks are pinched because out of community cars are parking locally.		Increasing doesn‚Äôt have to mean build. But I‚Äôm happy to sit with TA &amp; other groups to shape that message meaningfully
Something we can all agree on ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/tQsBLrTGZK
@macartney Okay okay! Let‚Äôs sit down! Willing to learn and grow from activists  :)
@acharya_dude I‚Äôm definitely open to hearing this side of this issue - all in all NYC works better with less cars on the road. I try to think of this from a ‚Äúshort-term needs to long-term goals‚Äù perspective.		Also make sure this is getting to your city councilmember, who makes these decisions!
This isn‚Äôt even going into the fact that the city stopped planning for new public infrastructure decades ago.		We also need to plan for big ideas like more outer-borough public transit (Bronx to Queens, anyone?) to reduce the number of cars we need in the first place.
1080 parking spots! Demolished w/o replacement! This is what I‚Äôm talking about.		Real estate devs don‚Äôt like garages because they can make more $ otherwise. But if they bring people in, they should realize we need to accommodate them with more schools, sewage plants, and PARKING. https://t.co/JxpUQXX75p
@_paul_pablo_ @macartney I do! üíú
@macartney @MakeQueensSafer I‚Äôd love that!
@macartney @MakeQueensSafer Yes, apologies if that was unclear - the bike lanes have a very clear + serious why. 		I had meant addressing why local drivers are so worked up over it. At the core, I think they want a safe neighborhood too - we can increase parking elsewhere to accommodate for the bike lane.
Some of the ideas/issues I‚Äôve heard from local Woodside+Sunnyside residents:		- Residential parking on side streets	- Uber drivers from BK &amp; outer Queens are leaving their cars in Woodside for days/week+ at a time. They don‚Äôt live there + take spaces from locals	- Municipal lots!
Because these developers don‚Äôt seem to support expanded municipal parking (like some of the ones found in Astoria), it causes the community to fight over scraps.		We can make moves that increase local parking while still having safe bike lanes. /4
Basically, real estate developers are buying off rezonings from elected officials via campaign finance.		This causes new buildings to bring in 100s/1000s more people into a neighborhood without making *any* public investments.		Schools, sewage, &amp; yes, parking all get strained. /3
I think a bike lane is a good idea. We‚Äôve had far too many tragedies in the area (@MakeQueensSafer has been doing good work here too).		People have intense, daily frustration w/ far less access to parking than they had before. But we also need to address WHY this is happening. /2
Oh man, this Skillman Bike lane issue is HEATED. I went to the town hall for it and it was packed to the max.		I‚Äôve sat with activists and small business owners on this issue.		Here are my initial thoughts - this issue is STRONGLY connected to role of real estate devs in NYC. /1 https://t.co/A2jpezayzQ
NYC: check your polling location early &amp; often.		You can find your polling place here: https://t.co/lt9pjNp3hY		But LEAVE ROOM FOR ERROR on Election Day! NYC pollsites often open late, have broken machines, or send you to other locations.		Schedule yourself time to vote. https://t.co/DgJD0htQiM

@Tim_Canova June 26th** üòâ and Thank you!
In order for our system to get better, we MUST pursue policies like #MedicareForAll - which is the only real plan on the table that will extend mental healthcare to all Americans. (Dental, too!)		We must also be unafraid to discuss topics like slavery, mass incarceration &amp; race.
This is also why @repjoecrowley‚Äôs most recent support for a stronger police enforcement bill is so hurtful + wrong.		Our district includes RIKERS ISLAND. Increasing criminalization is NOT how we get safer.		We must focus healthcare, education, re-entry + jobs for our communities.
Police came in, guns drawn, for a mental wellness check on a well-known figure.		Our policing and incarceration system is NOT resourced nor designed for mental healthcare.		These incidents occur in our own neighborhoods. People die - it happened right in NYC with #SaheedVassell. https://t.co/Uu1rjen2Dc
