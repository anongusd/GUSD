Crowd estimate: 5,000
Last speaker, Michael A. Hardy, lawyer for National Action Network, says, "We came in peace -- we did what they said we couldn't do."
NYC councilman Jumaane D. Williams: "They say the revolution won't be televised, but hopefully it'll be tweeted."
Kadi Diallo, mother of Amadou, says, "Police brutality is a human rights issue...we are against unjustifiable police killing."
Sharpton announces there will be a march on Washington, "when congress comes back."
Congressman Hakeem Jeffries tells crowd that because of ethnicity some police, "might think I'm a law breaker -- I'm a law maker."
David Paterson remembers late father, Basil Paterson: "In 1942 my father was pistol-whipped in front of all his neighbors for no reason."
Garner relative, onstage, also thanks Orta. "You're part of my family now," he says.
Sharpton praises "a young man with a video," Ramsey Orta, says "we're not going to let him be forgotten." Crowd roars.
Sharpton, to crowd, praises police, calls for department to remove "rotten apples."
Marching over, now speeches.
Two NYPD officers look down on march from roof of 120th Precint, four helicopters from the sky.
Marchers, singing &amp; chanting, snake past SI Ferry terminal, baseball stadium.
New chant: "We are the people, a mighty, mighty people."
Marching chants: "They say get back, we say fight back," "No justice, no peace," "Hands up, don't shoot."
Marching.
Crowd chants, "I can't breathe - one, I can't breathe - two..." up to 11.
Calmer now, march poised to start.
Tussles, shoves, shouts at start of parade as marshals struggle to clear path for Sharpton, Garner family, former governor David Paterson.
Sharpton stands where Garner fell with Garner's widow, Esaw Garner, and mother, Gwen Carr. Crowd, cameras bunch around them.
Commotion in crowd, cameras rise, bodyguards rush, crowd claps -- Sharpton walks to sidewalk spot where Eric Garner fell.
Joseph Evans, witness to death of his friend Eric Garner, looks at crowd, says, "I hope Eric's up above, seeing how much love he's getting."
Crowd begins to move to start of march, led by young man with hands raised high in the air.
Hoisted signs: "'Broken Windows' Kills,"  "Money to Fight Ebola, Not for War &amp; Racist Cops," "Don't Attack Just Because We're Black."
Man through bullhorn to gathered marchers, "Just bear with us a few more minutes."
Women in crowd of staged marchers selling $3 buttons that read: "I Want to Live," "Let Me Live," and "Justice for Trayvon Martin."
1199 SEIU union members pass out signs reading, "SUPPORT NYPD STOP POLICE BRUTALITY."
Crowd chants now: "I can't breathe."
Crowd of hundreds gathered at the spot Eric Garner died shouting, "Hands up, don't shoot."
Eric Garner's daughter, Erica, boarding bus: "My father would be very proud of what's going on, and his voice is being heard."
On one side of Ft. Hamilton Pkwy, marchers pose for selfies in Nat. Action Ntwk. shirts; on other side homeowner holds up baby in NYPD jmpr.
Big charter busses, full of marchers, rumble down Fort Hamilton Parkway in Bay Ridge, bound for Verrazano &amp; Staten Island.
Marcher Rose Strickland, 74, says heavy NYPD presence, "the first thing we noticed, that could be good, that could be not good."
At site where busses will pick up marchers, only a mother &amp; daughter, from neighborhood, waving signs in support of NYPD.
NYPD captain shouts to huddle of officers: "This turns into chaos, we've got no one to blame but ourselves."
NYPD tow trucks yank cars off block where marcher busses will drive.
Three blue &amp; white helicopters whap air overhead.
Groups of more than a dozen uniformed NYPD stand at intersections; parked on one side of one block, seven sedans -- all unmarked NYPD.
Blocks around the Bay Ridge, Brooklyn corner where marchers will board busses are heavy with police.
Many NYPD squadcars, vans and trucks on BQE in Brooklyn, heading toward start of march.
Follower: I'll be sending live Tweets today from the march over the Verrazano Bridge, led by Al Sharpton.
