&lt; he didn‚Äôt hurt me, I mean I suppose I could have when I was older right? But I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúdressed‚Äù like a 14 year old was I? Then it was did I say something to encourage him? Did I tease too much? Because HE was the drunk one would a lawyer turn it around on &gt;
&lt; I told him... yeah I know. I am. #WhyIneverreported is easy... at 14 I didn‚Äôt know it was rape, at least not the way it was portrayed on tv... it wasn‚Äôt violent, aside from taking my virginity (which he was proud about by the way until he found out my age) &gt;
&lt; the arcade where my friend waited. As we walked John turned to me and asked. ‚ÄúBy the way... how old are you?‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt sure how to respond so I asked him how old do I look? Do you know he said ‚ÄúOh I don‚Äôt know. No offense but you look like you‚Äôre 15.‚Äù And &gt;
&lt; babe. I won‚Äôt get you pregnant.‚Äù It hurt a lot, it definitely was not the experience of pleasure you hear people seem to talk about, it just seemed easier to just let him do his thing and finish. After the whole experience we re-dressed and headed back to &gt;
&lt; inserting his maleness within me. Oh! Oh wow! That hurts I thought and told him... no! Don‚Äôt! Stop! ‚Äùwhat‚Äôs wrong baby?‚Äù He asked as he waited for me to adjust. I was frozen I didn‚Äôt know what to say so I meekly asked wh-what about babies? ‚Äúoh don‚Äôt worry &gt;
&lt; He asked if she was sure, and as she already decided she responded yes. He felt up her chest. But then something happened... a twist, he reached down removing her pants. Uh oh! This is new what do I do? Next thing I knew he was between my thighs and &gt;
&lt; towards a little secluded area where they resumed kissing. This, 14 year old Me was used to, he‚Äôd ask permission to touch her boobs she thought. She‚Äôd say yes, he‚Äôd ask permission again and then she could say no then. She wouldn‚Äôt have to go any further. &gt;
&lt; eyes, rather ruggedly handsome. He was drunk and though they had been chatting at some point started kissing. As they kissed his hands lightly caressed her arms, back and sides. Eventually as the evening moved later they walked farther from the group &gt;
