@realDonaldTrump @cnn the question during press conference of natives commit more crime.  Of course...illegals shouldnt even have statistics in this country.
@realDonaldTrump wow healthcare 2.0 funding bill where it will hurt long after the passage is about to pass.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump So why dont you tell people how much money Obama moved around to help illegals....lets play a game.
Boy do the #99ers know how #DACA feels.  We was left behind over and over and over again.  We was never the priority just the pawn.  Im sorry you are experiencing this.
@realDonaldTrump so while democrats scream about you moving money around....do some research on how Obama moved alot of money around to illegals....
@RickyRebelRocks @realDonaldTrump Watching the mean comments....bunch of bullies.  Dont worry not everyone is hateful.  Stand strong.
@JLLicea @RickyRebelRocks @realDonaldTrump Go be mean somewhere else.  #StopTheHate
@SenSchumer Well theres something we finally agree on.
@IngrahamAngle your guest is wrong on Obamas economy.  Part time min wages jobs, 60% went to foreignors and visas.  The people left behind from recession wasnt part of Obamas economy.
@DNC @realDonaldTrump @RNC how about we fix this.....https://t.co/SnEKqEb5w8

@cunning_chops @SpeakerPelosi @RepMaxineWaters @FSCDems Ouch....that looks like it hurts
@tombrokaw I actually agree with part of what you said.  People should be proud of their culture.  But respecting the culture of a country you came to needs to be respected.  It goes without saying americans shouldnt have to be forced to learn Spanish.

@MatthewDraghi @realphilhendrie @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Typical dem activist tactics.....
@AndyOstroy @realDonaldTrump Having a voice in this country should never include threats, lies and bullying.  Grow up internet man with absolutely no integrity.  Those kids did nothing wrong.
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Unfairly?  The threats made against those kids made it criminal.  I expect all threats to be investigated.  Having a voice in America should NEVER be dangerous.
@Alyssa_Milano Right now while your reading this...theres millions of homeless in our country many with kids.  Compassion matters sure wish it was given equally.

Turnout is lower for odd year, primary and local elections
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump So you dont take any responsibility?  You are refusing to budge on anything....do your job already and could you please stop lying and playing political games.

@IbelieveinQANON @charliekirk11 I cant prove it...but when i have 75 friends in common with her all very liberal obama supportors and there already was a complaint of leaking....id say its a good place to look
@charliekirk11 MS.....initials....

@adidasoriginals you should offer a sale right now....need new sneakers.  Buy one get one free to give to homeless vet.
#SCOTUS. Durbin actually asking Judge Kavanaugh to suspend this hearing until Bush archives are open is omfg rediculous.  		Thats like asking a janitor to not do your job until the dirt outside dissappears.
How about we unarchive obamas paperwork that we need?  Oh right its only wrong when a republican does it.  #dogNPonyShowDC #KavanaughConfirmationHearing
@senrobportman Dems clearly angry lol but no one really pointed to whatyou dont like about the judge.  Productive comments would be helpful.
@CBSNews So am i understanding this right?  Country not unified and bashing someone makes us unified?  What kind of BS politics is that?
#McCainMemorial. I thought John McCains service was great.  However if the message was our differences make us stronger and we should not shy away from those we disagree with was lost when you exclude the one person he was last to disagree with.
@sommer_langton Retweeted from Ohio...over by Findlay...
@realDonaldTrump As McCain would say.....to every commentator....We are better than this.  How about you be better than hatefilled attacks.
@realDonaldTrump While everyone comes on Twitterto blast Trump and talk about morals.  Perhaps they too should be showing some respect and be nicer to each other.  Look in the mirror.  The hatefulness doesnt help anything.
@MeghanMcCain simply Beautiful tribute to a great Dad!  Prayers the memories give you comfort.
@SenJohnMcCain RIP...Senator McCain was always at his best.  While someone was in their worst crisis.

@JohnKasich this law requiring a marriage certificate for even a non driver license is rediculous. Or the companies are not applying it correctly.

@Goss30Goss @Jim_Jordan Seriously you all that desperate to treat this man like he was the pervert?  Pretty shameful and a huge sign of desperation...ps. Its not working.  Signed a true victims mom of a child who a sicko harmed.
@realDonaldTrump @GovMikeHuckabee @foxandfriends Who they hiring matters...or should i say who they NOT hiring matters.  Focus
@TSearcaigh How sad you forgot all about the forgotten....but thats what the dems are good at.  Forgetting people who actually matter.  I hope you #wakeup and remember who you forgot along the way.
@realDonaldTrump Dont forget about older people....they was crushed from Obamas policies.  And companies shy about hiring them.
I anyone knows anyone looking for work I need guys!  FT/PT Elevator PVT Inspectors, MUST have QEI and ex, there is NO training program for this. Can earn up to $140,000 a year. Need inspectors in all 5 boroughs, you will be working for Dept. Of Buildings, Elevator Division.

@realDonaldTrump i cant stress this enough.  GOP must continue to address poor people and the #forgotten and stop acting like everythings all better.
@FoxNews Guess the #Forgotten will forget to vote.  Thats whats going to happen if you dont tell the whole truth.  Democrats did that...how did it turn out for them?
@FoxNews i see alot of celebrating over economy.  Are you all absolutely positive the #forgotten have recovered?  You so willing to put all your eggs in that basket.  #neverForget

@TechQn @cvpayne Its wrong a community college classes should be open to all.
@DorisDaylight1 @cvpayne Its true at Owens Comminity College in Ohio.  Just because one college doesnt do it...its not across the board.
@cvpayne issue with welding...you have to be referred by a union.  Look at owens community college.  Just to take classes you must be referred or sponsored by union.
@HouseGOP Jobs for who?  It matters who is getting hired and who you are not helping...

If 12 russians influenced our elections then what R dems doing about 30 million illegals influencing our elections.  Meeting our politicians and buying advertising and have non profits that support their cause?  They have websites, fight for policy and meet with dems #MAGA
@TuckerCarlson ok so your guest doesnt think alot of illegals vote!  But they do have websites and go meet with politicians to influence our elections.  Far higher in numbers than Russia

@WalshFreedom You Tea party never Trumpers find it so easy to believe Russia helped Trump win....you never once took the time to look at who wasnt from your republican party came over to support Trump.  Shameful

#StrzokHearing are we really having a hearing where conjecture is the mantra of the day?  Seriously if a court room ran like this it would be just as big as a circus..
#StrzokHearing i wish democrats would ask questions instead of grandstanding....what are they hiding?
@wally52167 @realDonaldTrump Just really looks like someone who knows his agency will protect him as well as dems.
@tedlieu I didnt see that...i saw him refuse to answer any question and needed dems to jump in.
@RepGoodlatte @Jim_Jordan @HouseJudiciary @GOPoversight Its funny he opens door answering questions regarding investigation when dems ask.  Someone better be the lawyers and push that issue
@Jim_Jordan i hope you go after Strzak because he answered investigation questions when dems asked..but the screams FBI advised me with all questions from GOP.
I loved the i dont recall writing that text...but i will tell you what it means lmao #StrzokHearing

@TGowdySC he is answering questions from dems regarding investigation its only when gop asks does he answer FBI advised.. He opened the door.  Walk thru.
