@paulwiggins 98 percent of Australia's population resides in the coastal areas, which gives them a lot of lands to fall back	largely self-sufficient, so an enemy wouldn’t be able to blockade the country and starve it out	However, China's investment in Pacific Islands can give them port access
@paulwiggins - Australia has no nearby major power.	- a successful armed force (Especially the Army) landing on mainland Australia would be a logistical nightmare
Which is the safest country if World War III happens?		1) Not a priority for any military power:		- Madagascar	- Sri Lanka	- Iceland	- New Caledonia	- Iceland		2) Logistically difficult:		- New Zealand	- Australia	- Fiji		3) Politically uninvolved:		South America	Greenland
