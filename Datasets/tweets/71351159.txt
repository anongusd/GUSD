@DaleNelson2 Oh absolutely agree. If you want to know my opinion on the threat, it’s actually more cyber than anything. When non-state actors can access our system, what do you think China is doing? We r blind and don’t even know it.
@DaleNelson2 The branches could be much leaner &amp; more agile to compensate for small scale conflict. I just don’t understand their feet dragging in this area. When I left in 07, deployment pkgs were still Cold War era relics.
@DaleNelson2 Honestly, this can be applied across the entire DoD. All branches are struggling, &amp; have been since the end of the Cold War, to find their way strategically &amp; how to exist in a world without a state actor to battle. 9/11 exacerbated this problem &amp; there is no solution in sight.
@BrianLaslie @DaleNelson2 There are so many other factors but just wanted to show 1 outside perspective. I know a lot of great fighter/bomber pilots that would make great CSAFs. I also know many great loggies &amp; maintainers that would have to. The ability to see the USAF/future from 30K ft makes a CSAF.
@BrianLaslie @DaleNelson2 It’s more complex than this &amp; I’m not saying they make bad leaders, but I see a diminished ability to think strategically &amp; listen to outside counsel when making decisions. This is strictly an observation and in no way am I saying they make bad leaders.
@BrianLaslie @DaleNelson2 Here is a unique perspective from outside the military: single seat military pilots have greater trouble integrating into a crew env when transitioning to airlines. How does this apply? Their willingness to listen to outside opinions can hamper progress/problem solving.

@glinch72 @PaulEDawson @AlexEpstein Sure, sure. So what ur telling me is that climate scientists don’t look back at the data to see what it did (Hindcasting) in order to alter their model’s algorithm to predict climate change better (Forecasting)?
@glinch72 @PaulEDawson Sure, nonsense.....	https://t.co/vxuCX9YO9b
@glinch72 @PaulEDawson Sure. If you say so.
@glinch72 @PaulEDawson Let me rephrase my point: temp increases have paused somewhat in the last 15-20 yrs &amp; I don’t deny there has been a temp increase in the last 150 yrs. But, climate models have never once predicted what they claim &amp; they mislead public policy makers. It’s not settled science.
@glinch72 @PaulEDawson @AlexEpstein That was my point. Show me a climate model where, when it was published, it’s predictions have been proven accurate (one that doesnt get altered with the hindcasting). Politicians make policy based on erroneous models that have never been right.

@Killbot18951271 @spookykat1 @JeffMerkley @AOC When it comes to transportation, leave things to the market but give incentives to move to better.

@Killbot18951271 @spookykat1 @JeffMerkley Gotcha. Just making sure before I brought on the sarcasm. I am no scientist but I have done a lot of my own research into energy technology.

If you are using Twitter to answer hard questions from reporters, @AOC @Ilhan , then you are showing the ppl of this country that you don’t want to talk to them and you are hiding something....it shows a lack of maturity in politics &amp; maybe you aren’t ready for the big time.

Days like today, watching the outrage over a teenager &amp; a Native American, makes me wonder if I really need to be a part of Twitter, or any other social media platform anymore......
@arawilson @RepInnamorato Granted those cases are fewer than conservatives want to admit. It’s more of a talking point for them and 1 I don’t like.
@arawilson @RepInnamorato That’s why I believe in revamping how lobbyists work DC, curbing their influence on govt. I despise lobbyists b/c of corruption it causes. I believe supply side enriches everyone, just not equally. I also don’t believe in pulling ppl along who don’t want to contribute.
@arawilson @RepInnamorato Also, when govt is not involved in the economy, ppl have more of a say for their individual lives than a broad brush policy that lumps everyone into the same bucket. You &amp; I each have separate life priorities. The govt limits my choices economically when they drive the economy.
@arawilson @RepInnamorato I think we are gonna have to disagree on this point. Govt is not there to fix an economy/jobs. It more often than not harms it &amp; exacerbates problems that, if left to market forces, will, and has throughout history, corrected itself. It just takes time &amp; most ppl r impatient.
@arawilson @RepInnamorato Sowell to me is a much more data-context driven economist. His arguments have heavy, long term looking projections on economic impact of govt meddling in the economy. IMHO
@arawilson @RepInnamorato Not true &amp; many income inequality arguments ignore statistical context in their arguments. The problem with solely basing ideas on empirical data is that sometimes that data has limitations. The theorist takes that data as infinitely accurate w/o reflecting on long term effects
@arawilson @RepInnamorato He didn’t say he was communist. Just Marxist and there is a difference in the two.
@arawilson @RepInnamorato Read Thomas Sowell. That’s better stuff. His ideas and data on economics, free markets, the myth of income in equality are leaps a bounds beyond Picketty and has been around and verified for much longer.
@arawilson @RepInnamorato If you say so. And empirical data, taken without a context to all factors is what limits Picketty’s argument.
@arawilson @RepInnamorato . When you say move up do you mean increase in # of jobs or upward mobility in employment? After that you got wordy and made no sense.
@arawilson @RepInnamorato https://t.co/hWwIf7u7QK
@arawilson @RepInnamorato But we aren’t talking about mngt. We are talking about baseline workers. Not sure why that is relevant to this conversation.
@arawilson @RepInnamorato Where is this evidence?
@arawilson @RepInnamorato New industries will emerge &amp; jobs will be created. If you go down this road, history says otherwise: there has never been a time when technology advanced, replacing human capital &amp; jobs decreased long term. If you can find one I would be interested in seeing the data.

@alexjackhughes @EhcksTGD @RepInnamorato I don’t agree with not being paid for work. But I also know there is a choice to make: take the unpaid internship or find another avenue that pays to get experience. And yes they are out there for those willing to look &amp; work for it.

@arawilson @RepInnamorato I’m in a union. Collective bargaining is the real reason. It’s good I agree. The worker protection aspect of unions is useless. It protects mostly the lazy &amp; loud. Unions need to move out of employee actions &amp; leave that to labor laws. Stick to CBA as it’s core purpose.
@arawilson @RepInnamorato Here is the myth: min wage is not meant to be a living wage. It’s meant for transient employees who will rise in the ranks or move on to better paying jobs. Attrition of the workforce, retirements, etc will open liveable wage positions &amp; ppl should move up.

@RepInnamorato Economics lesson: take fed min wage away. Companies will try short term to decrease min wage until they run out of employees willing to take said $ by going to companies paying more. It will be either they go out of business or raise wages to compete https://t.co/M1OVQtqCm4

@CanadianLane @smallblocks15 @CNNPolitics @jaketapper I bet we have more in common than comes across on Twitter.
@CanadianLane @smallblocks15 @CNNPolitics @jaketapper That’s why I don’t like our politicians at this point. They r corrupt, all sides, &amp; few have the best interests of this country in mind. I believe that if something needs to be done, I cannot wait on a bureaucratic sloth of a govt to handle things for me. It’s my responsibility.
@CanadianLane @smallblocks15 @CNNPolitics @jaketapper Canada is a great country and ally. But we are still different. Some of your solutions might work. I know some won’t b/c of limitations in our laws. But we just need to work together not against one another. It’s why I hate our American political climate right now.
@CanadianLane @smallblocks15 @CNNPolitics @jaketapper That’s what makes America different. Not better, just different. I believe communities, villages, &amp; families are the solutions, not the govt b/c a big overarching govt doesn’t have a clue what we need here in little town USA. We do &amp; work to serve others around us.
@ThomasA40384397 @CanadianLane @smallblocks15 @CNNPolitics @jaketapper I bet if all of us could sit in a room, not on our phones or computers, and would actually talk with one another, and not at each other over this stupid platform, we would actually have some really good conversations and maybe even solve some problems.
@CanadianLane @smallblocks15 @CNNPolitics @jaketapper No they won’t and thats where you have to stop being arrogant yourself. The programs of Norway or Denmark, w/ large homogeneous populations of 5M will not work in a country of 330M made up of so many diverse cultures.

@ThomasA40384397 @smallblocks15 @CanadianLane @CNNPolitics @jaketapper If your solution is the govt that means you have relenquished control of your life to them. Why do you want someone deciding what your kids learn, what doctor you have to go see, what you can and can’t say?
@CanadianLane @CNNPolitics @jaketapper You really are not listening to me. They can’t work from the beginning because of the nature of our constitution. It’s not arrogance. It’s the understanding of my own form of govt. This is my exact point. Arrogance is thinking you have solutions w/o understanding how things work
@ThomasA40384397 @smallblocks15 @CanadianLane @CNNPolitics @jaketapper Politicians and govt are not the solutions to our problems. We are the solutions to our problems.
@CanadianLane @CNNPolitics @jaketapper What really annoys me though, and why I am pushing back so much, is how people condescend to Americans all the time because we disagree with them. Europe, Canada, Mexico always want to tell us how to run our country, while missing the problems in their own. That’s my frustration.
@CanadianLane @CNNPolitics @jaketapper *i cannot be turned away. Sorry for the typo
@CanadianLane @CNNPolitics @jaketapper No we have healthcare. Because I can go into any ER here &amp; not have to pay a dime to get treated not can I b turned away. That’s an actual law. Gun laws can be improved here but our constitution has limitations we must work w/, thus our solutions cannot be the same.
@ThomasA40384397 @smallblocks15 @CanadianLane @CNNPolitics @jaketapper No, you do have the choice to leave. But I understand not having the means. So what are you doing to make it better? Im writing a book with solutions to our problems and working to get those solutions presented to anyone who will listen and work towards those goals.
@CanadianLane @smallblocks15 @CNNPolitics @jaketapper I never said they were the best way. I never said they were better. I did say they are different &amp; that is scary to a lot of ppl. And I never said there was not a need for improvement. Wow, you implied a lot from me simply saying Canadian solutions may not be right for America.
@CanadianLane @CNNPolitics @jaketapper I have healthcare. I pay and work for my healthcare. Always have. School defense could be strengthened no doubt. I’m may think differently than you but I’m not as dumb as you are implying here. We have 2A &amp; that’s different than Canada. Differing forms of govt r also in play here
@CanadianLane @smallblocks15 @CNNPolitics @jaketapper I’m not the one trying to prove we are better, so there’s that....
@CanadianLane @CNNPolitics @jaketapper No that’s not it. My thinking is that we want to be different. We don’t want to be any other country. We want to b ourselves. That doesn’t mean we can’t learn from other countries. And see, you tell me that my thinking is wrong. 50 other countries don’t have our complexities.
@CanadianLane @smallblocks15 @CNNPolitics @jaketapper You got the objective numbers to back this list up? Or just a list of items you subjectively are telling me are better based on your own opinion? I’m good if you show me that Canada has better healthcare but what information are you basing this on?
At least we can agree on this..... https://t.co/o7FbdxY9fa
@CanadianLane @CNNPolitics @jaketapper You live in Canada. You don’t live here in the US. if you don’t live here, you don’t understand how things work, how we think, why we think the way we do. It’s like a person who has no kids, telling someone who does, how they should parent from experience they don’t have.
@smallblocks15 @CanadianLane @CNNPolitics @jaketapper Please show me these objective standards and measures. Maybe we can find a way to improve them.
@smallblocks15 @CanadianLane @CNNPolitics @jaketapper I am assuming ur a US citizen. #1) it sounds like ur telling me I should view our country as you tell me to, #2) if Canada is so much better, then why are you still living in the US? #3) If you want to stay here, are you going to do something about our problems or just gripe?
@CanadianLane @CNNPolitics @jaketapper You got a statistic on that large amount of Americans? And we can be unhappy with the way things are run and still like our country at the same time. And that last line is like taking advice about parenting from a person who doesn’t have kids.

As for right wing media, quit being sycophantic. After Trump was elected, @FoxNews turned into the @CNN &amp; @MSNBC of the right. Now we have to do even more research for ourselves to find the truth. To be honest, our brains are tired.
Divisive sells, as admitted by the former NYT editor. Soooooo, America, we have 2 options: listen &amp; try to understand while calling out the BS on all sides (media included), or entrench ourselves further &amp; end up w/ an intellectually broken United States.
Does Trump say stupid stuff and lie? Absolutely. But just b/c the media glossed over &amp; covered for Obama for 8 yrs does not mean he didn’t lie &amp; say stupid stuff. I blame our entrenched &amp; mega-politicized media for all our political problems b/c they don’t want to be objective.

Many who talk immigration solutions have never seen or been to Ellis Island. It’s not all that different from current holding areas as we vet immigrants barring the family separation thing. Looking back is sometimes a great way to move forward.
How about larger ports of entry in the capitols of countries where the most immigrants come from? Expedite the process there. If ppl still try to cross the border illegally, instead of those POEs, maybe they don’t want to come for the right reasons.
Border walls r 1 solution. Right or wrong it’s a starting point for discussion. Let’s talk pros/cons instead of digging in &amp; screaming at each other.
Border security discussions r pretty easy when we set the common ground: legal, fastidious immigration. Proper channels. Contribute to American society (taxes, intellectual property, etc). No criminals, drugs, sex traffickers. Now let’s talk solutions.
@DFlaherty08 @TheRickWilson They want to argue walls aren’t 100% effective. That’s the true part. But the southern wall is a deterrent to force immigrants to come through legal channels. But ppl want to get too emotional about this. We want these ppl here if they will contribute, not if they want free stuff

@TheRickWilson You might want to check the ahistorical references in ur own tweet since you seem to confuse strategic military and containment walls. But if all you wanna do is own Trump and his supporters, there is nothing accurate here either.
@TheRickWilson Those referencing the Atlantic wall by the Germans have no understanding of military strategy if you intend to use that as an argument. Against guns, soldiers, bullets and bombs it was somewhat effective. Pretty sure it would have stopped unarmed ppl storming the beaches though.
@TheRickWilson No wall is impervious. The walls In Northern Ireland are pretty effective at their job of holding factions at bay. The Moroccan Western Sahara Wall is pretty effective at holding the land Morocco wants to annex from Mauritania.
@TheRickWilson Seems you need a history lesson @TheRickWilson So let me start with this: Bill Mitchell is a goon but you are just as bad in your assertion. He said slowed illegal border crossings. Has zero to do w/ most of these walls that were for military purposes.

@AceOfSpades081 @CNNPolitics I know they do. I was in the USAF. But I see you don’t understand what the function of this will be. It will unite all branches, and their space functions, into a unified command structure for use of those assets only during combat. It’s like CENTCOM for space.
@CNNPolitics And for the record, Space Force is a bad idea. Space Command is a better use of funding and resources at this stage.
@CNNPolitics Space Command is not Space Force. It’s a unified combatant command w/ the function of combining the space resources of all the branches under one commander for use in combat operations. It is not a separate military branch &amp; this will most likely will come from current funding.

He is just an idiot and he was doing something any normal person would do trying to get their way. Had he shoved her down or been more forceful, I would agree but it’s semantics at this point.
@Bobbob84327909 @_taraleisa @ahal79 @rf17021 @Acosta He did touch her inappropriately for a professional journalist. Not like a sexual inappropriate, but he just shouldn’t have done it.
@Bobbob84327909 @_taraleisa @ahal79 @rf17021 @Acosta It wasn’t accidental. He intended to push it away in order to keep rambling on and arguing. But it wasn’t assault. He is still a journalistic hack. Period.

While we did our mock investigation of this actual accident, we all came to the conclusion within about 20 mins that the gear box seized. Which was in part the truth but not the cause of the accident. Our instructor walked us back about 300 yds to a small piece of canvas.
When I was training as an aircraft mishap/crash investigator in the USAF, they always told us not believe our first instinct of the cause. They said we needed to step way back in the chain of events. For example, one actual accident we looked at was a helicopter crash.
@DonnaMarieXYZ @MichaelSkolnik You lost me after your first word.
@MichaelSkolnik USS Cole, Khobar Towers, OKC, WTC ‘93, US Embassy in Tanzania, all bombs. What is your point? Bombs are illegal. Automatic weapons are illegal. The problem isn’t the method of destruction it’s the people. Get that part right first then let’s talk about smart regulations.

@jlm0013 @DaleNelson2 @BigJimYoung If the coating is down that could be considered PMC on conventional missions like we fly in Afghanistan w/ no air threats. But in another context, it’s NMC if the stealth is out.
@jlm0013 @DaleNelson2 @BigJimYoung Yes. I fly for a regional of AA and was an USAF aircraft maint officer. It’s just not a good comparison IMHO. They really need to look at how they classify MC rates if they want a good picture of an aircraft’s true capability. Problem w/ F-35/22: paint/coating.
@DaleNelson2 @jlm0013 @BigJimYoung It’s a manipulation of the numbers in a way but I think it would more accurately reflect the true mission status of a given asset. The MC classification system is another holdover from the Cold War if u ask me and it masks true mission capability in a post CW environment.
@DaleNelson2 @jlm0013 @BigJimYoung If they want to see a true MC rate increase, they need to look at how they categorize FMC PMC NMC. Heavies have better MC rates because they can utilize a true PMC status for the aircraft. Fighters don’t really use PMC much and it reflects in the lower rates.
@DaleNelson2 @jlm0013 @BigJimYoung Comparing fighters to the airlines as far as MC rates is not apples to apples. I can fly a CRJ or Airbus w/ a whole slew of maint items that still make it FMC to carry pax. Once a certain system goes down on a fighter, it’s automatically NMC across every 1 of its missions.

@edrhew @NateSilver538 Ok. I hope she can back this up then. But also there have been no other witnesses to all of this that have come forward to corroborate her account. That’s another reason. Not to say she shouldn’t be heard.
@edrhew @NateSilver538 Judge showed up in person to the Senate Judiciary committee and gave a sworn statement. All Dems walked out of that meeting.
@J_in_RVA @gapundit @KenDilanianNBC @NBCNews Not sure exactly what this entry has to do with anything besides putting them together to go pick up skis and Tobin’s house. This is not corroborating evidence by any evidentiary standard whether a Senate panel or criminal invest w/o exact time and place.
@J_in_RVA @gapundit @KenDilanianNBC @NBCNews They didn’t call him b/c they already had his sworn statement saying he wasn’t there. They gave her the hearing so that we could stop all of this bickering back and forth in the media and the country could hear both sides first hand. I agree Judge should have been there.
@edrhew @NateSilver538 When did Swetnik make a statement under oath? Maybe I missed that part.
@J_in_RVA @gapundit @KenDilanianNBC @NBCNews B/c then you open the door to every person who wants to make a bogus claim against someone seeking office b/c way back in their past they did something to them on the playground at lunch. Maybe we need some burden of proof for the allegation before proceeding w/ a full invest?
@edrhew @NateSilver538 Mark Judge made a statement under penalty of perjury to Senate committee in person. This lady is going to a grandstanding lawyer to make claims without evidence or consequence of criminal liability for lying.
@J_in_RVA @gapundit @KenDilanianNBC @NBCNews To try and understand your stance, do you think we should investigate every allegation made against nominees for office?
@J_in_RVA @gapundit @KenDilanianNBC @NBCNews What new information is there that corroborates her story against Kavanaugh that they have not already told the committee? The FBI told the committee the allegation was not credible. No evidence thus far justifies further investigation.
@edrhew @NateSilver538 It’s just an example.
@edrhew @NateSilver538 It’s a start. Would you believe the ambulance chasing grandstander or the hard working prosecutor?
@edrhew @NateSilver538 Same applies. What’s on his record to say he isn’t credible?
@edrhew @NateSilver538 Maybe because he has been a sitting federal judge for years with an unblemished record while Swetnick has had restraining orders taken out on her for threats of harm to an ex boyfriend and his kids and family? I mean there’s that.......

@J_in_RVA @gapundit @KenDilanianNBC @NBCNews Also, do you understand anything about polygraphs as far as law enforcement is concerned? In both of the cases here, OJ and Ford, their lawyers had them administered not LE b/c they are inadmissible as evidence in a criminal matter. Which means, they r wildly inconclusive.
@J_in_RVA @gapundit @KenDilanianNBC @NBCNews What does her being a Republican have anything to do with what I said? Thus the problem here. Everyone is acting like this is a sport with sides to pick. How about just picking right and wrong and we go from there.

@DFlaherty08 Well again we will agree 2 disagree. Had this been a movie about the American achievement of the Apollo program, I can see the argument. But since it’s about Neal Armstrong the man, it’s petty to me. He was so much more than the flag &amp; I think it’s wrong for ppl 2 politicize this
Nooooooo, Really????? https://t.co/eTYJbtCh77

⁦@DFlaherty08⁩ This is the stuff we need to be fighting against. We need to loudly expose the lunacy of the left in respect to policy and the fallacy of their platform. This woman does not need to be mainstream.  https://t.co/z2uDM8ZWyn
@DFlaherty08 This is all noise that distracts from solving real problems. It’s a great strategy the left is succeeding at using to distract conservatives from the real problems they don’t want us to shed light on.
@DFlaherty08 Not sure how you got that from what I said. And no that’s not at all what I’m saying. Why not blow off this stuff &amp; fight the big fights? We waste so much energy on petty crap now that we get nothing done except trying to b the loudest &amp; most offended, just like a liberal.
@DFlaherty08 I’m sorry but this is my whole beef: conservatives are starting to sound like whiny leftists, crying about every little slight. When did conservatives become this? It’s not who a conservative is. We are ppl who fight &amp; solve real issues, not petty or perceived slights.
@DFlaherty08 History does matter. And this story is about the man and not the event. The flag is not germane to who he was completely. Yes he was a great American hero. If this was about the Apollo program as a whole, then yes I see this argument.
@DFlaherty08 That can finally be told after all these years b/c I’m almost 100% positive that Neal Armstrong did not want this movie made while he was still alive. He hated the spotlight and he is turning in his grave at all these “patriots” raising a stink over one scene.
@DFlaherty08 I see the creative reasons given 4 leaving this part out, by the director AND Armstrong’s 2 sons. It has ZERO to do w/ patriotism &amp; everything to do with Neal Armstrong. But I’m getting irritated b/c everyone wants to focus on their butt hurt &amp; not the legacy of this man......
@DFlaherty08 There is a reason he gave only a hand full of interviews over the yrs. he wasn’t a glory hound like Chuck Yeager. If you ask anyone who has met these two men, Neal Armstrong was as humble as they come and Chuck Yeager is a self-centered pompous jerk.
@DFlaherty08 With all due respect, I have done a great deal of research on this man in my life. This argument would have made him mad because it focused on him. The film makers wanted to finally focus on this point &amp; tell his story, not necessarily all about the moon landing.

@ClarenceSwirly @GenChuckYeager If he was a non flag waiver, THEN WHY DID HE WEAR ONE ON HIS SPACE SUIT IN THE MOVIE?????
@ClarenceSwirly @GenChuckYeager Have you actually seen the movie? It’s a serious question. And BTW, if you knew anything about Neal Armstrong, he probably wouldn’t have wanted this movie made at all. He believed whole heartedly that this mission was about mankind, not himself. He hated the spotlight.
Your rage against Hollywood and it’s leftist bias, and trust me it is justified at times, is now blinding you to a story about a man of character. This movie is about the man, and not the mission. Go see it and marvel at someone who’s character transcended our petty differences.
Ok folks on the right, it’s time to stop whining like leftists. Those who don’t know who Armstrong was as a person would not understand that this part being left out is ALL Neal. He was a very private man &amp; never wanted to be seen as anything but an astronaut. GET OVER IT.

#11) When a majority of us say there is maintenance, please stop w/ the looks of haughty derision. There is a good reason why we have had 1 fatality in commercial aviation in 9 years: it’s called safety. We like our pax alive so u can give us nasty looks b/c u r home safely.
#10) If you want to know where to eat and not eat in an airport, ask a crew member, especially the old ones. If you don’t know where to go in an airport, just look up. Signs are everywhere with big arrows and messages to point you in the right direction.
#9) Stop what u r doing (music, movies, hitting on the person next to you) &amp; listen to the flt attendant’s safety demo. It really will save your life. See attached photo. Every passenger you see here is wearing their mask wrong. Don’t believe me: watch the demo next time w/ pic. https://t.co/ht90yhYjaN
#8) Please keep your kids entertained &amp; disciplined. A flight attendant’s #1 job is your safety, not babysitting your kid, getting you drinks, or handing out pretzels. They r there to get you off the plane, alive, in an emergency. Don’t get me wrong, good customer svc is a plus.
#7) When a crew member tells you they cannot do something b/c it is federal law, they are telling you that b/c if you break this law, most likely that crew member will be fined as well: TSA does not fine ppl lightly. The bidding normally starts around $10K and goes up.

I always do my best to go as fast as I can but I am limited by many factors I cannot control.
Book at least 1:15-1:30 between connecting flights to account for delays, like weather and air traffic control, that are 9 times out of 10 outside the control of the crew. Poor planning on your part does not necessarily constitute an emergency on my part.
#3) Unless you have turn signals and brake lights installed on your roller bag, look before you just stop in the middle of walkway or decide to, all of a sudden, go for that cup of coffee to your right.

@BrianLaslie @politico He was our wing CC at SJAFB. Always an honest and down to earth leader. I could see the lofty dreams but he usually was able to match that w/ delivering on a lot of his promises. Just my personal experience.
@BrianLaslie @politico That’s my other problem w/this idea.....bloating of the bureaucracy. DoD already has problems w/ FWA. Get that under control first, then use those tax savings to fund a “Space Corps” under the USAF. It already has established agencies w/in to assist in its gradual growth.
@BrianLaslie @politico If one looks at the history of the Mercury/Gemini/Apollo/early Shuttle programs, in the context of innovation &amp; society, more was done for us as a whole, faster, through these exploratory programs than at almost any other time in history.
@BrianLaslie @politico NASA has not been working its original charter since the early ‘90s &amp; that has been my rub. W/ exploration comes innovation, which in turn spurs technology that benefits the nation as a whole &amp; lifts everyone’s std of living. A separate branch though is not the answer.
@BrianLaslie @politico I do believe Russia &amp; China pose us the biggest threats in space. And we do not need to play catch-up like we did in the ‘50s and ‘60s. The problem I have w/ NASA today is they r not focused on space in an exploration capacity. More of a science experimentation capacity.
@BrianLaslie @politico I believe we need to take a harder look at reinvesting in space. There r too many reasons not to, ntnl sec being just 1 facet of that. The military will have its place but not the pre-eminent position. NASA needs to take the lead along w/ the military.
@BrianLaslie @politico From my personal experience working for Gen Kwast before he became a GO, this man is a leader &amp; I highly respect his opinion. Do I think we need a Space Force? No. Could a division of the USAF b developed like the Marine Corps is to the USN? I believe so.

@LilyBelle05 @joshtpm Should the govt do a better job than this? Absolutely. Can the conditions be better?Absolutely. Would I take 60 days of these kids being detained to ENSURE they r actually w/ their parents &amp; not a smuggler? Absolutely. The world of human trafficking is dark &amp; cruel.
@LilyBelle05 @joshtpm It’s as if you want to turn a blind eye to anything but the fact there is a huge risk that if these kids r truly not w/ their parents, and the govt just let’s them go, they could be lost forever to a life of sexual exploitation. But ur ok with that it seems.
@LilyBelle05 @joshtpm Each time someone tries to make this story about the cruel treatment of immigrant children, i get angry. Because EVERY SINGLE ONE of u neglects to think of the many children who have slipped through b/c of catch &amp; release &amp; r now being cruelty treated by the sex trade.

@pilliarscreatio If there is a decade I could ever go back and be a part of, it’s a toss up between the 1940s and the 1960s. Either way, the advancements we made, as a country during those two decades, was nothing less than heroic on so many fronts other than just space and WWII.
@pilliarscreatio Govt programs like this serve the greater good better than any social program ever could IMHO. They raise the bar in so many areas when we can leverage the American mind &amp; our muscle to reach goals far beyond what we can imagine.
@pilliarscreatio The circumstances r evident but there is no doubt in my mind that Apollo changed America &amp; sparked an engineering/technological revolution that is unrivaled in history. This program alone brought innovation that may have taken decades to invent, if ever.

@treegranny @EricHolder The media has not reported much on the issue of sex trafficking because it then lends credence to why the govt is taking the actions they are. Things can be done better no doubt. But it’s better than letting these kids, even just 1, not be exploited.
@treegranny @EricHolder It’s the news media. I don’t necessarily believe a lot of news outlets, on both sides, because of their abilities to cherry pick quotes and send a message without proper context. The hearing transcript gives context and that is what all media lacks doing sometimes.
@DaleNelson2 It’s all about the Benjamins...........

@treegranny @EricHolder What scares me is you seem to think it’s ok for some kids to be sold into a life of sexual exploitation over the many kids who will reunite with their parents after a short separation. Those few sex slaves may never see their parents again. And only live short lives in misery.
@treegranny @EricHolder I will take the psychological harm for kids being separated from their parents for a short stint over the psychological damage to kids being sold as sex slaves for the rest of their lives any day. Those kids are separated from their parents too. Most times permanently.
@treegranny @EricHolder Asylum has been loosely used as a way for those entering to get by coming to a border checkpoint. Many don’t qualify for asylum under the laws implemented previously. Instead of changing the laws, congress just wants to gripe and moan.
@treegranny @EricHolder Ever talked to a law enforcement officer about this before? I have. What you read is not what is going on. Talk to people intimately involved in what’s really going on. But if you are ok with just 1 kid slipping through the cracks to be sold as a sex slave, I won’t agree to that.
@treegranny @EricHolder Maybe they are deporting ones who aren’t parents, but are known criminals or suspected sex traffickers.....the media just isn’t reporting this. I promise you, this does not fit the picture they are trying to paint &amp; they won’t acknowledge this problem.

@medwoman1 @SenGillibrand So if I was to say the casino industry was unscrupulous because it pretty much does the same thing as these businesses, you would be ok regulating them out of business too?

@afinngirl Not if everyone keeps saying it’s also to identify those being “shadowbanned.”  B/c then everyone just talks about shadowbanning &amp; not the real tragedy. The true disgrace is kids lives being destroyed while ppl just want to yell &amp; scream about immigration &amp; shadowbanning.
@DFlaherty08 Yes but hijacking a symbol for awareness of the disgusting human sex trafficking problem is beyond acceptable.

@JustRichWebster @MikeBlack114 @BrianLaslie F-35 may be a decent platform from 10-20k feet, but if it has to start getting in the weeds, it’s gonna have survivability problems. Plus it’s ability to forward deploy in austere conditions is highly questionable in my book. But yes this is my USAF perspective.
@JustRichWebster @MikeBlack114 @BrianLaslie Call me a fan boy if you like, but I have been fwd deployed w/ A-10s, F-16s, &amp; AV-8s. The deployability of the A-10 to any fwd base close to troops is unmatched. My support for it goes beyond strictly mission. That’s what I think many of the brass miss. IMHO
@JustRichWebster @MikeBlack114 @BrianLaslie To me, the F-35 was intended as a stealth replacement for the F-16, then AF brass decided to try &amp; pigeon hole it into CAS. The A-10 has qualities beyond just the mission that no other aircraft has: remote basing ability, greater low alt loiter time, ease of maint, etc....
@JustRichWebster @MikeBlack114 @BrianLaslie We had USMC Harriers stay in country 2 weeks then shove off b/c they kept FODing our motors. We covered vul periods when F-16s couldn’t get a/c in the air for them. There is more to the A-10 than just the CAS platform argument.
@JustRichWebster @MikeBlack114 @BrianLaslie Although I agree w/ ur points in the article and agree things are more nuisanced, having been in combat as a maint officer w/ these, listening to both USA &amp; USMC ground assets, all said they always felt safer w/ the A-10 when it showed up......consistently.

@LarocheA2 @laraseligman Please tell me how much the F-35 can carry compared to something like the A-10 or F-15E.

@LarocheA2 @laraseligman You can ask @MarthaMcSally too.
@LarocheA2 @laraseligman Ask any Marine or Army soldier what aircraft they would rather have watching over them: everyone I have talked to says the A-10 not the F-35. But that just comes from the customers of that support. And this why it has survived being scrapped at least twice publicly.
@LarocheA2 @laraseligman It doesn’t matter how powerful the engine is when doing CAS. It matters how survivable you are and how much weapons you can carry plus loiter time. Those three factors drive an affective CAS platform.

@rowlandville @sandra8301 @Peggynoonannyc That comes from a poem.......John Gillespie Magee Jr called High Flight. We used to have to memorize that during field training for the Air Force.
@rowlandville @ian_mckelvey I don’t think it’s political gain to be honest. There are many things Trump uses for political gain no doubt. I truly believe kids are not one of them because he is a father himself, dispite what the media may say.
@rowlandville @ian_mckelvey It’s not best but it’s what we have right now and can be improved. But it’s better than just letting loose w/o vetting the families from the sex traffickers
@rowlandville @ian_mckelvey I don’t believe it’s heartless but you are correct in saying that keeping them detained together at least keeps them monitored. It takes time to investigate these things. I’m just want Americans to give the process time to work.
@rowlandville @ian_mckelvey The problem w/ the children being debriefed is that they are in essence brainwashed or scared into not saying a word about their situation for fear of torture death, families being killed, etc.
@rowlandville @ian_mckelvey Than letting slip those kids who will never know the love of great parents b/c they were ripped away from their families forever to feed the sexual appetites of disgusting sex traders and abusers.
@rowlandville @ian_mckelvey I have no doubt this is affecting kids being separated from their families. But I would take a little trauma for the kids in good families who will recover in time b/c of parents who ❤️ them enough to seek a better life for them.......
@rowlandville @ian_mckelvey And some of these kids r being separated from their parents for life instead of a couple of months. All in the name of using them to satiate the sexual pleasures of disgusting ppl across the world. If that’s ok w/ you then I have no words left.
@rowlandville @ian_mckelvey What would you do if you were POTUS then? Seriously, what is your solution? &amp; if it is only reunite kids w/ their families then I cannot discuss this anymore b/c I would see an unwillingness to recognize that there is a darker side to this issue than you r willing to admit.

How do you explain the vileness of human trafficking to someone who only sees Trump vs the criminal human trafficker? He is the easier target when you know nothing of the dark world of human trafficking the media keeps hidden.
@rowlandville @ian_mckelvey Unfortunately, it does have to be either/or on this issue when these kids do not show up to the border w/ birth certs &amp; all the proper docs as well as “adults” LE can’t positively identify as their lawful parents. I implore u to talk w/ someone who is in this LE field.
@rowlandville @ian_mckelvey And I am not his base. I did not vote for him. I only support this issue b/c I have more in-depth knowledge of the trash that claims to b these kids’ families than most ppl b/c I know someone who has investigated these pieces of garbage for yrs.
@rowlandville @ian_mckelvey Did he not just sign an executive order to keep families together? But u also need to understand families in the detention center is a loose term. When they come to the border, the adults can claim they r their kids when really they r being trafficked.
@rowlandville @ian_mckelvey Forgive me but I think you need to talk with ppl who r intimately involved in this area of LE. It will open ur eyes to the absolutely grotesque treatment of kids in the sex trade. Current documentaries r child’s play to the hell these kids go through.
@MikeRoach3 Replacing the A-10 and F-16 with the F-35 is like replacing my Charmin Ultra Soft with that stuff they provide in public restrooms on an industrial roll.
@rowlandville @ian_mckelvey There is no easy solution to this but here is how I see it: we can protect the few from THE ABSOLUTE vileness that is sexual exploitation at the expense of those who voluntarily seek immigration and asylum in this country.
@MikeRoach3 Holy heck this is worse than I thought.......
RT @Bible_Time: Pray always, Pray everywhere. https://t.co/1AJ6u22c3p
@rowlandville @ian_mckelvey But my question is this: in order to keep families together at all costs, you are willing to sacrifice a few kids to sex trafficking over the many? In my book, that’s worse than separating families for a short time.
@rowlandville @ian_mckelvey This knowledge doesn’t come from Trump or his surrogates or the media. This comes from ppl who are intimately, and have been intimately involved, in the process of investigating &amp; prosecuting these vile criminals for years.

@rowlandville @ian_mckelvey But we must be cautious since many families don’t come across the borders with identifying records. It’s hard to distinguish child sex traffickers from family members. And sometimes family members r paid lots of money to run kids through this process by the traffickers.
@rowlandville @ian_mckelvey Yes, but a large part of this entire conversation is being overlooked: more children than you think r being exploited for the sex trade through the laziness of our previous policy on enforcing the laws. Don’t get me wrong, I want kids with their families.

@DaleNelson2 I need someone who can channel the inner Reagan in all of us. You can throw a Bad Shepard m, or Van Halen lyric, or even a DC Cab reference every once in awhile. No one will ever know.
@DaleNelson2 This isn’t politics, it’s writing. Just writing then you can go home for the day.
@DaleNelson2 Yes, I know you keep saying this, but at least just do my speech writing and then you can do this on the side.
@DaleNelson2 has to be there in the White House with me whether he likes it or not. And I would bring his wife in so she can give me the dissenting opinions on many issues. It’s the only way to stay grounded.
When I become POTUS, I want @benshapiro as my Chief of Staff or Press Secretary. At least someone in my administration would shoot straight with me.

@CoachSeg @lisamurkowski There is a better solution but ppl can’t stomach it &amp; don’t see forest for the trees: only provide insurance for catastrophic illness &amp; injury. Let the market decide rates on regular doctors visits and “tune ups.” Now we can have the like car insurance discussion.
@CoachSeg @lisamurkowski And, I don’t want the govt telling me what I have to buy regardless. There were problems before no doubt, but the feds sticking their nose in it made it worse. And if you tell me they require us to buy car insurance it’s not an apples to apples comparison.
@CoachSeg @lisamurkowski 1st where does that number come from? Show me data that supports that &amp; don’t parrot a politician. 2nd, insurance was never required before Obamacare and a hospital was never allowed to turn away a patient.

@DaleNelson2 Just like you need to help me understand how the internet should be regulated like s utility.
@DaleNelson2 Ugh Dale. We need more scotch and time so I can try and help you first understand how this whole system works, second understand how intense govt regulation prevents a better customer experience, &amp; yes third address the areas where we need to improve as an industry.
@DaleNelson2 No no no. Dude, the hub and spoke system is why this is the way it is. It’s not that simple.
@DaleNelson2 You really have a misunderstanding of how this system works. The airlines do not control gates nor do they control what routes are assigned. The airlines apply for and the federal govt assigns routes and the local govt assigns gates. All airlines fly into all hubs.
@DaleNelson2 I just want you to know also that Net Neutrality is, IMHO, the reason the FCC is preventing the fastest fiber optic internet in the country from coming to the county I live in. I’m 2 miles from the county line. FCC will not allow them into it.
@DaleNelson2 My whole thing about this argument has to do with customer service. Market forces by customer choice will, in the end, right the ship and the better companies will thrive while the bad ones will languish.
@DaleNelson2 I will never excuse that my friend. I hate when anyone says it’s not their job. I loath pilots who don’t understand they provide a customer service &amp; only care about themselves. I despise the gate agent without sympathy for ur situation.
@DaleNelson2 I will never excuse poor treatment of passengers, but I will also never excuse the absolutely abhorrent treatment of airline workers that I see on a daily basis b/c passengers don’t understand the regulatory shackles we have. Both are disgusting.

@DaleNelson2 Also, this thing called Net Neutrality is preventing fiber optic faster internet from getting to us out in rural areas of our country: the FCC is preventing the fastest internet in the country for reaching us only 1 county over.
@DaleNelson2 Wow, my good friend just kicked me in the balls &amp; says the service I provide as an airline pilot is terrible. No doubt there are problems but this is also a lack of understanding of the IMMENSE govt regulation (the FAA is just 1 example) that hampers our service abilities

I think Net Neutrality has some of the same detractors as when Reagan deregulated the airlines back in the 80s. But over time, air travel has become cheaper &amp; more readily available to many Americans. I think the same will happen with the Internet. IMHO

8/ I’m gonna give y’all three solid tips for air travel: 1) book at least an 1.5 hr connection time 4 possible delays. 2) Expect delays 3) Be kind &amp; patient to airline staff
7/ And then don’t try to force ur bag into the overhead bin, break the door on the bin, &amp; then blame me b/c I now have to call maintenance to come defer the bin door so it doesn’t crash down on ur head in the moderate turbulence we experienced in flight.
6/ There is a reason, on our smaller aircraft that ur massive roller suitcase will not fit in the overhead bin. Please stop trying to convince the fly attendant u have a tight connection &amp; don’t want to wait 4 ur bag. DON’T BOOK LESS THAN 1:30 ON UR CONNECTION NEXT TIME.
5/ #4 Lets get something else straight: wings create lift. When 4” of snow r on top of the wings, lift is hampered just a tinsy winsy little bit. If I don’t remove it &amp; prevent more from accumulating, the plane WON’T FLY. It’s physically impossible. Death will occur.
4/ #3 The reason we can’t takeoff w/ just a little snow on the runway is b/c my aircraft is 2 heavy &amp; if we have a problem rolling down the runway w/ snow on it &amp; ihave to abort the takeoff, I don’t want to take u on an excursion off the other end of the runway. #inertia #physics
3/ #2 the reason the airport in the middle of southern Mississippi doesn’t have a snow plow, is b/c it isn’t economically feasible to have that piece of equipment on hand for the once in every 5 years it snows 5 inches in three hours.
2/ I only get paid when the passenger door is closed, the red flashy beacon lights are on, &amp; I’m off the gat. So any notion I get paid while you languish in the terminal and not on my plane is just nonsense.
1/ As an airline pilot, I’m going to dispel some myths about airline travel during times of bad weather. #1 If you think im getting paid while I sit there w/o passengers on the plane waiting for maintenance or snow removal equipment to clear the runway, u r sadly mistaken.
