@TFab1474 That’s what the Bernie bill keeps: the VA.
Sen. Kamala Harris’s idea to abolish private health insurance in the US is neither new nor surprising. She endorsed the Bernie Sanders “Medicare-for-All” bill, which does just that along with eliminating Medicare as it exists today. You like your current insurance? Say goodbye.

My take ahead of the Federal Reserve decision: The Central Bank definitely raises short-term interest rates today. No hike would signal those brainiacs already think we’re headed into a recession. And would freak the market out.
@AFMedic902X0 If you have an allergy you have to tell the airline in advance. They will accommodate you. The airlines are cracking down on support animals because they fly for free. Otherwise the airlines charge &gt;$200. This is about money and creating a “problem” where there isn’t one.

@PatsyO1963 I’m positive about the trade truce with Europe. But the remaining steel and aluminum tariffs are hurting businesses and costing jobs.
@GregPelfrey Tariffs are a tax. They destroy more jobs than they create. And hurt businesses and consumers in the US.
@SteveNicklas1 Tariffs are a tax on businesses and consumers and destroy many more jobs than they create. I stand by that. They’re a bad idea and the ones we have belched up so far are still in place. Might want to take a breath before you claim victory.

@Spyke_and_Iris If watched the show regularly you would know my answer.
@ZFLife28 And the “approach” of tariffs are hurting more American businesses than helping. This $12 billion in welfare to farmers is trying to fix a problem created by this Administration.
@ZFLife28 Well, I wouldn’t be talking about a trade deficit as a “debt” we owe. It is not. It’s an accounting mechanism.

@vvertel @TAGHeuer A $600 (!!!!) service and they sent it back like that. And then treated me like a POS when I was upset and asked for a new band.
@TAGHeuer Horrible service and treatment. Your employees need to learn to say, “We are so sorry this happened. How can we fix it?”
@TAGHeuer @vvertel You replied to the wrong person. Wrong tweet. I am the one with the watch.
@BG97942685 @TAGHeuer This watch worked fine. I took great care of it. Wore it on air every day. I sent it in for cleaning , service. It was returned w/a damaged, filthy clasp + a band that was obliterated. Not even a “Sorry” from the new Fifth Ave. Store or repair rep. Treat the customer like a POS.
Godspeed Barbara Bush. Family first.
@colonelguano @TAGHeuer Company does not care.

@Nascarjunky18 @KennedyNation @DennisDMZ @MZHemingway @JessicaTarlov @Jamie_Weinstein @BuckSexton @michiokaku @FoxBusiness Gas tax is a user fee. It isn’t high enough to cover basic federal road repair. Then you don’t get your Interstate fixed any longer with someone else’s INCOME tax dollars. Spend Spend Spend as long as someone ELSE is paying for it. Very liberal idea.
@MorchaBob @KennedyNation @DennisDMZ @MZHemingway @JessicaTarlov @Jamie_Weinstein @BuckSexton @michiokaku @FoxBusiness People who use the roads should pay to fix them. They don’t. If highway trust fund doesn’t have enough money which it hasn’t in years, don’t take money from general revenue. Drivers aren’t paying enough for federal road repair. Period.
@markflesberg @KennedyNation And NEW YORK CONTRIBUTED $48 BILLION *MORE* in federal TAXES than the state received IN FEDERAL SPENDING. THIS STATE IS A GIVER TO THE FEDERAL FISC. NOT A TAKER LIKE MANY MANY STATES. DO SOME RESEARCH.
@Swicky427 Not the subway bud.
@StitchJonze @KennedyNation My *federal* income tax dollars should not pay to fix the Interstate in Missouri that I don’t use. GAS TAX IS A USER FEE. USER SHOULD PAY WHAT IT TAKES TO FIX THE ROADS. Money should stop coming rro@ general revenue.

@BobGreene333 @MorningsMaria It was meant as an absurd hypothetical. These political talking points on “mental illness” are meaningless. What’s the R plan? A database tracking people in treatment? Violation of civil liberties.

@david413 Children of the disabled, deceased, retired can also receive SS. “Mental illness” is a go-to talking point for many. Politicians who voted to rescind this rule should be asked why.
@FNC_Ladies_Rule @NBSaphierMD My point is: When a politician says “mental illness” is the real problem they need to answer WHAT THAT MEANS. What do they want done.
@hellion2172 Whoa
@FNC_Ladies_Rule The issue: Many politicians use “mental illness” as a talking point. Anyone who voted for this should be asked why.  AND not just retired workers receive SS benefits. Like the disabled or children of retired, deceased or disabled workers. To be clear.
@MikFin The issue: “mental illness” is a talking point. Then politicians should speak to this.
@plettkeman Certainly worth asking lawmakers who voted to get rid of this rule why they voted that way — if “mental illness” is the real problem. A talking point for some.
