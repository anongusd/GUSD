@darthbriboy Uh... no? Let's focus on independent and Republican hatred of her for now. People gabe her shit for things we let male politicians get away with literally all the time. And plenty of people had a much harder time taking Hillary seriously due to her gender. (Ima link some studies
@darthbriboy I say this with love but the only politician who will ever be good enough for you is a Marxist unicorn that's horn is made of nationalized petroleum.
@darthbriboy We lost 2016 for a lot of reasons and choosing just one is misleading and ignores a more complex picture that includes things like race baiting, personal candidate quality, sexism, etc.
@darthbriboy Uhh not really, we lost Congress because almost every midterm is a bloodbath regardless of level of progressivism  (and again actual irl poli-sci research shows more ideologically extreme candidates cost their party a few points which matter in swing seats (1/2)
@darthbriboy ...opposing the repeal of the ACA, among various other issues.
@darthbriboy So Manchin votes with the party about 40% of the time according to 538. That's compared to Capito, WV's R senator, who votes with Trump 96%. That's a big difference that includes his support for Net Neutrality, (limited yes) immigration reform, his vote against the tax bill...
@darthbriboy But we're talking about WV... like I said I'll take a DSA member where they can win.
@darthbriboy Manchin has the money, name recognition, incumbency advantage, campaign network, etc to win this seat. Literally no one else in that state does.
@darthbriboy Why though? This is a dark red state. Like it or not you need blue dogs. If this were NYC I'd be all with you but it's WV. The world isn't gonna socialize overnight.
@darthbriboy Put it another way. Ojeda is in an open seat and a good politician, dems have nowhere to go but up. Manchin is a household name with a lot of money and the best bet to win the state. Maybe Ojeda can in a few years but don't hold your breath for an AOC here.
@darthbriboy On some issues yes, but he's also a super good fit for that district (military, life long resident, defends coal, etc). And I never said you couldn't shift it left. It's more that it won't happen overnight and primaring someone in a swing seat rarely works out.
@darthbriboy Also no offense, you're my friend, but it's easy for us to to take a protest vote. We're far less at risk than other people in this country. We have a lot of privilege.
@darthbriboy Plus data is against you in WV. It's getting more, not less, conservative/red over time. That's not to say it's impossible but it doesn't happen by throwing away your vote.
@darthbriboy Easier said than done. This is a dark red state. Democrats who have a chance have to either be named Manchin or literally have voted for Trump as Ojeda did. Can we push some issues to left? Of course but this isn't a state where you can snap your fingers and *bam* universal pre-k

What Doug Jones is doing for instance, trying to push his constituents gently to the left while having people like Bernie and AOC simultaneously shifting the Overton Window I think is the right way to go.		https://t.co/3bYKj9sUWy
And I like Swearengin. This is nothing against her. The truth is for Democrats to control the Senate we need more moderate/conservative members.
Look. I'm not wild about Manchin politically, but third party/Indy bids rarely work and it'll only cost Dems a seat. It can't be said enough: It's better to have someone who votes with you half the time than someone who never will vote with you. https://t.co/BCHc2s0vIG

I should also add that as a straight man I'm not the most qualified to say if this aspect to the show is progressive or not. To me it comes off as a mixed bag at best, but I could be wrong.
The more I watch this show the more I'm fascinated by its author's politics. For instance, in the very same episode the show has a very mixed portrayal of a gay man that is both pretty progressive (for the time), and is also Capital P problematic.
It could be making fun of the "perfect life" the empire would want citizens to think they could have OR it could be a genuine attempt at "character growth" and "humor" of which it is neither. #LOTGH
Episode 59 of #LegendOfTheGalaticHeroes is so weirdly sexist that I almost wonder if it's parody. It's honestly hard to tell, but I sure hope it is (probably sincere though). :'(

So if you're a fellow traveler in a red district/state with a Democratic politician who is moderate/conservative ultimately I think you should still vote for them (most of the time). If you're in a blue seat then yeah hold their feet to the fire. (5/6).

@Michael2014abc @JMilesColeman Now personally as a leftist I want this to work because it would mean 1) more minority representation in government and 2) a stronger chance of more progressives being elected.
@Michael2014abc @JMilesColeman This would mean that Dems don't *have* to go blue dog to win less blue-leaning seats, by rewarding their often ignored minorty base they can still win elections.
@Michael2014abc @JMilesColeman If she wins, or the margin is very close it means that a campaign focused on turn out of non-regular voters over persuading regular voters can work. (keep in mind Georgia is still pretty red, so winning is unlikely either way but the same tactic could work in swingier states)

@_GaryLane No one is saying gang members are blamless, you're ignoring my arguments. What I'm saying is that calling these felloe humans animals is dangerous for obvious/historical reasons. Genocides start with dehumanization.
@_GaryLane So you're a poor hispanic person with little chance of advancement and a gang might be your only option. It does NOT make you a bad person, but yes some people in gangs are not good people, however dehumanizing them solves nothing, and is dangerous (see The Holocaust) (5/?)

@_GaryLane Actually I would argue most, if not all white people (including me) have a degree of bias against minority groups. It's not inherently your fault. We've been raised in a structurally racist society so we internalize it. Same goes for men, cis/straigt folk, etc.

@spencerdpotts (And I'm not opposed to Green candidates either, I'm voting Green for Superior court on Tuesday)
@spencerdpotts Taking it to PA, I'll gladly support any left challenger to Wolf or Casey, but if either of them win the primaries, that's who I'll support
@spencerdpotts I'm saying in the here and now we support the best, worst option.
@spencerdpotts True, and keep in mind I'm all for fielding leftists, even in purple states but Northam won the primaries so he's what we got.
@spencerdpotts But there are real consequences to equating candidates who are night and day in many cases
@spencerdpotts Because Gillespie would do 100 bad things instead of just 30 or 40. It's easy for you and me, two white guys in PA to say both sides are bad
@spencerdpotts It's important when it's close, and when a loss could effect candidate recruitment in other midterms, and voter enthusiasm
@spencerdpotts BUT VA is still a purple state and you can't elect leftists overnight
@spencerdpotts And I should add I was not a Northam person in the primaries
@spencerdpotts Expansion, pass damaging environmental laws, cut taxes that fund important things, etc.
@spencerdpotts It's playing to dumb white people  (yes to an extent there is no difference) but Gillespie would not only ban thrm, he'd end the Medicaid...
@spencerdpotts Northam is not playing to white nationalists like Gillespie is.
@spencerdpotts No I didn't, that's awful of course, but Gillespie would do much worse. Ik that lesser of two evils argument gets overused but...

Also upon a re-read of the coup are idk why people say it's too slow and long. Didn't really feel that way to me.
It always takes away a bit of the intrigue for me but yeah that's totally subjective
MAJOR Spoilers:	I always feel a reveal involving the fantasy world having tech like ours always feels off
...if you're more hear for the story's twists and turns it might seem a little *off*
Now I care a lot about Titan's themes and ideas and they're presented so well that I don't care the reveal is a little jarring but...
So when it comes to the content of that basement I'm a little split. Thematically it works but narratively it kinda jumps the shark.
With the caveat being the manga is on its own amazing and worth reading. The anime is just that good
I mean I just want good writting in a manga and Titan's is so great I can easily forgive it's shortcomings, but yeah anime&gt;manga
Like both have improved a lot But yeah this story is far better with Araki's direction and Wit's animation
So caught up with the U.S releases of the AoT manga and god the writting is amazing but that art and pacing tho.
