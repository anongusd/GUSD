We need to understand what happened to Jakelyn, as well as the thousands of children who were separated from their families.  We must have #JusticeforJakelin, humane comprehensive immigration reform, and smarter border policy that doesn't undermine or betray America's values.
In January, with a House majority &amp; the leadership of @NancyPelosi, we will restore sanity to American public policy-making. The border, her residents, and those who come through here have been targets of this administration and deserve compassion and dignity as a priority.
I'm very grateful to members of the CHC, the leadership of @JoaquinCastrotx, the presence of @repbenraylujan, @CongressmanRuiz, @RepAlGreen, @RepLouCorrea, @NormaJTorres, @RepEspaillat, @RepVeasey, @SenatorSylvia, @ChuyForCongress, @XochforCongress at yesterday's events.
7. Another wall won't change or fix anything. It will only further divide our country by fueling anti-immigrant hysteria, wasting precious resources for a monument of hate and bigotry -- a symbol of our misplaced and skewed priorities and a lack of understanding of the border.
5. Ports of Entry also need investment in both personnel and infrastructure to adequately process the families and the number of people seeking asylum; 6. We need real leadership right now in order to find long-term solutions WITH the countries in the northern triangle;
4. The CBP policy of blocking asylum-seekers is further exacerbating the challenge, creating yet another humanitarian crisis on the other side of our ports of entry where families wait in limbo for their turn in line;
3. This administration has made a challenging situation MUCH worse by using cruelty as a deterrent, hoping that Central American immigrants will just go away, refusing to see that until we address the root causes of migration, it will only continue to grow;
2. Border Patrol and Customs Border Protection personnel don't have the training, resources or facilities to deal with families, especially children crossing the border. They need EMT training, medical equipment, better cell phone coverage, facilities w/ cots and kitchens;
While there's still so much we don't know about why Jakelyn died, and we won't know until the autopsy is complete, here's what we do know:  1. More families are being pushed out to remote, rural, dangerous areas of the border, and this is an area where they are crossing;

5. SPREAD THE WORD. Help us spread our call to action all day, and all over social media by tagging your photos, voting check-ins and block walking with #BorderBlitz.  Let's flood social media tomorrow with our political activism. (10
3. PHONE BANK. Can't walk? Make calls.		4. MOBILIZE FRIENDS AND FAMILY. Take charge of making sure that all your freinds and family go vote. In El Paso, we can sign you up for our special ‚Äúfriends and family‚Äù program. (9
Our #BorderBlitz day includes:		1. VOTE. In El Paso, join us at @BassettPlace (6101 Gateway Blvd W) at NOON as we gather at the polls and cast our vote on the first day of early voting.		2. BLOCK WALK. Join us as we spend the day knocking on doors. (8
This is especially personal to those of us on the border.  So on the first day of early voting, the day the Divider In Chief is in TX, and the day of our massive call-to-action, we're calling our call-to-action day our #BorderBlitz. (7
But to win these elections, we need historic turnout.		Let's turn tomorrow into the biggest call-to-action-day that we‚Äôve ever seen, especially on the border. All day, let's knock on doors, phone bank, mobilize our friends and family and turn out in record numbers. (6
We‚Äôve got great Democrats statewide and up and down the ballot, including @BetoORourke, @LupeValdez, @CollierForTexas, @NelsonForSenate, @KimOlson4TxAg, @GinaOrtizJones, @SenatorSylvia, @ColinAllredTX, @Lizzie4Congress, @janasanchez and a number of other inspiring leaders (5
What‚Äôs the answer to their politics of desperation? 		The politics of inspiration.		This mid-term, we can take our future into our own hands and elect candidates who want the best of what government can do. (4
We know the script: Thousands of people whipped up by the politics of fear and division will chant ‚Äúbuild that wall,‚Äù bullying whatever woman has been targeted at the moment by chanting ‚Äúlock her up‚Äù and, Trump will portray vibrant and safe communities like El Paso as unsafe. (3
We‚Äôve seen our neighbors in Mexico called rapists and criminals; we‚Äôve seen asylum seekers denied lawful entry; and, we‚Äôve seen children ripped from the arms of their mothers and put in cages. And the architect of all of that will be in our home state. Tomorrow. (2
El Paso and Texas Friends:		Tomorrow, Monday 10/22 is a big day.		It‚Äôs the first day of early voting!  Also on that day, Donald Trump will be coming to Texas.		We in Texas, and especially those of us on the border have been witnesses to the worst of what government can do. (1
Beautiful day to be knocking on our doors. Only TWO more days until early voting. We‚Äôve been knocking on doors since September 2017, and we‚Äôre going to keep it up until Election Day. There‚Äôs too much at stake in these #2018MidTermElections! https://t.co/l5i7cGU6jU

@jcbaquera @BetoORourke @BNHRFernando 5.  Immigration judges should have broad discretion on asylum cases and they should be independent of the DOJ.
