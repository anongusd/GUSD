@AOC ? is *takes* suposed to be FAKES? cause there is no FACTUAL news on TV, just a bunch of opinioned nutbags, but you aren't worried about FACTS right?
@AOC you obviously aren't paying too much attention, the PAST is very far from the present... and the only unfairness is that socialists keep blaming others for their past mistakes....BO
@QueensLibrary @AOC watchout for book burning.... that IS a socialist thing. also CENSORSHIP, like what social media does to conservatives....
@AOC and just WHO is paying for all the FREE school? are teachers gonna work for FREE? outta the KINDNESS in their hearts?  NO.... who's payng for the toilet paper electricity? water, sewage, trash, janitors, cafe ladies? No such thing as FREE, someone has to pay... WHO?
@ImikSabi @AOC did you re-read what you wrote? i was there in the 70's &amp; 80's, we had to get gas on certain days &amp; wait in LONG lines. the economy sucked! interest rates were out of control thanks to carter. altho he is no-longer the worst prez in history, BO suk'd more
@ImikSabi @AOC a 70% tax bracket will encourage them to split before they lose all their money... what would you do? just hand over your hard earned money? socialism doesn't just effect the rich, the middle class has plenty for the gov't to steal from, duh, right now they are sharing, wake up!
@MasterofDiaspar @larson_travis @alexclavering @AOC if they voted for socialists... they aren't smart at all... def not rocket scientists... bad education system... next swamp to be drained... when kids can't read an analog clock and can't sign their name in cursive...why are we paying school taxes? cyber schools... have a future!
@larson_travis @alexclavering @AOC ouch! great one!!!
@AOC do you realize that even if you have a plug in car, you need fossil fuel to charge it... and who will be able to afford the 12 $600 batteries that go in a solar powered car? nobody but the rich and they all split because of out of control taxes and regs. they did it once already.
@AOC a permanant ban on assault weapons was put in2 effect in the 30's. U have 2 have a collectors license 2 have assault weapon. if you want "common sense gun laws" make murder a absolute death penalty.  why punish law abiding citizens? do you just wanna disarm citizens like hitler?
@AOC and this is even easier to understand, at a 70% tax rate, people will quit their jobs and get welfare too. or they'll pack up and leave, like the uber rich, buy a yacht and live on the ocean.
@AOC geez, you really either have no clue.... or you truly hate America...  single payer healthcare will collapse our economy in a couple of months. right now only 10% of citizens are on medicare, and it's due to be broke by 2026.
