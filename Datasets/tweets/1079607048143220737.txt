@AndrewYangVFA We need to redefine labor.
@marileyyyy @AP_Oddities @AP 😂😂😂
Elijah Cummings’ closing statement was a bit of a roller coaster, but I found it engaging and somewhat inspiring. #HouseOversightCommittee #CohenHearing #CohenCongressionalTestimony
@marileyyyy @FluffSocial If Koda was affectionate. 😂
@AndrewYangVFA Wages should be tied in with the cost of living within an economic area. Too often we focus on numbers when percentages would do a better job at mitigating inequality.
@AndrewYangVFA Happened here in Seattle, rents are now double the cost due to multiple economic factors. I can’t say how $15 would impact areas without huge economic growth, but the lack of rent control here did little to improve the standard of living for working class citizens.
@WhiteHouse Quantity or quality, what is the goal?
@SenSanders The exploited have adopted a culture that promotes exploitation.
@CuomoPrimeTime @CNN Will we ever be able to get away from opinions?
@StephenAtHome This just in: Russians now exporting said weapon to suburban American teens looking for a cheap high.
@strong_coffee71 @tedcruz Thank you for your time.
@strong_coffee71 @tedcruz Now that’s a completely different discussion. Eliminating taxes is not a cure for lack of transparency or fund misuse. Also, please don’t assume what I want or what I consider to be effective regarding taxation. That being said, I would like to move on from this conversation.
@strong_coffee71 @tedcruz The government needs income in order to operate. As your attitude shows, most people do not feel a sense of duty and are culturally opposed to paying taxes. Making it purely optional is not a logical move.
@strong_coffee71 @tedcruz Lol, I’m not receiving any government assistance. I’ll be fine, I’m poor because I’m a student. I have wealthy grandparents, and when they pass I will receive a large inheritance. However, I didn’t do a damn thing to earn that money. I don’t mind it being taxed.
@strong_coffee71 @tedcruz You have hardly made an argument that supports your conviction. I live under the poverty line within my area. I can empathize with the human ability to justify excess and the drive to fear scarcity, but the estate tax is just an entitlement that is not marketed as such.
@strong_coffee71 @tedcruz If the government isn’t going to set up regulations that limit income inequality, then there is a need to redistribute wealth in order to promote a more equitable and sustainable economy.
@strong_coffee71 @tedcruz Agree to disagree.
@tedcruz Working men and women tend to not have much that’s taxable. My grandfather was in the Navy and an electrician, and my uncle was a welder, neither’s wealth was affected by estate taxes. It’s the wealthy that would benefit from it being taken away.
Regardless of your feelings regarding climate change and it’s validity, it is a no brainer to reduce fossil fuel usage for our air quality alone. #ClimateCrisis #GlobalWaming
@Jim_Jordan Sounds like you’ve got it covered. 🤔
The “American Dream” is synonymous with upward mobility. Upward mobility has been trending downward for decades, thus the “American Dream” is becoming a self-defeating cultural icon. #AmericanDream #UnitedStates #culture
@MikeCrapo I call BS on this. Upward social mobility has been trending downward for decades.
@charliekirk11 That being said, apparently Russians aren’t Democrats. 😂
@charliekirk11 Streamlining the ability for oppressed groups of people to vote isn’t synonymous with permitting illegal voting.
@ConanOBrien I think he was just trying to get a rise.
@CNN @marileyyyy This is just about the most Florida thing ever.
@charliekirk11 They can’t afford boats that could take them to Europe? They aren’t headed toward Nicaragua or Honduras, pro capitalist counties. You can’t blame a socioeconomic system on all social ills. There are cultural, resource, and hierarchal issues that lead to an unhealthy society.
@NotfakenewsMiss @CNN Trump is a Republican.
@emptypockets57 @ThisCantBeTrue2 @SenSanders How aren’t the tax rates 90% in countries that have universal health coverage?
@ETranshumanism @RepRussFulcher @MikeCrapo I’m not going to answer that because you are trying to corner me with your argument and say that where I agree with your argument then negates my disagreement. If this issue was a simple as you say, it wouldn’t be so contentious. Thank you for your time.
@ETranshumanism @RepRussFulcher @MikeCrapo I’m not confused about a scientific definition, I’m arguing about how it compares to a developed human life I.e. something capable of being murdered. Thank you for the food for thought, but I am not sold on your argument based on how it relates to the legal issue with abortion.
@ETranshumanism @RepRussFulcher @MikeCrapo I read your explanation, and I agree that they are human cells, but I disagree that your statement merits the definition of fertilized cells being the same as a matured fetus or infant. Individual hman cells do not equate human life, even if the individual cells are alive.
@ETranshumanism @RepRussFulcher @MikeCrapo I agree that they are human cells, I disagree that you can consider them as a human life in the way that this argument begs. Early on, I don’t believe it is conscious, I don’t believe that it can suffer, I don’t believe that it can be murdered. Late stage abortion is wrong IMHO.
@ETranshumanism @RepRussFulcher @MikeCrapo Again, we are getting into semantics. And comparing the death of cells to a murderous act is a stretch.
@ETranshumanism @RepRussFulcher @MikeCrapo I get that, but that does not equate into a full human life when considering consciousness. Does a bacteria equal a human life? No. Without getting into semantics, I’m going to state my point that this isn’t a cut and dry issue, and I agree to disagree with your conviction.
@ETranshumanism @RepRussFulcher @MikeCrapo That is not an equal argument. No one gets satisfaction or personal gains out of abortion, the intent is an act of desperation. You have to also consider that your view on abortion is not how others view it. The timed grey area between sperm cells/egg and human life is tough.
@ETranshumanism @RepRussFulcher @MikeCrapo I’m not a fan of abortion. That being said, eliminating it legally won’t stop the supposed need for abortion. Abstinence doesn’t work, a war on drugs doesn’t work, banned abortion won’t work.
@RepRussFulcher @MikeCrapo Investing public funds in methods to reduce addiction, poverty and to promote education may lower the needs for abortion. Just a thought.
@emptypockets57 @ThisCantBeTrue2 @SenSanders Thorough*
@emptypockets57 @ThisCantBeTrue2 @SenSanders Are you an economist? Send me a link to a through rundown and if that is true I will admit that my reasoning is wrong. However, based on the research I have done, this opinion is a gross overstatement of potential negative impacts.
@emptypockets57 @SenSanders Taxes. Similar cost to our private system, but since taxes are unpopular in American culture, it’s easier said than done. Americans spend the most for healthcare and when looking at social determinants like infant mortality being 170/220 countries and 33rd for overall coverage.
@SenJohnKennedy What are the other 5 countries? You propose a narrative that aligns our policy with that of countries the American public finds undesirable. To be fair, list all the countries so that we can get the full picture.
@realDonaldTrump Commenting aside of your policies and beliefs, you simply lack any sense of professionalism in your persona. It’s disappointing to see the leader of the United States poke fun like a fifth grader, it’s inappropriate.
@BillCassidy Can they be considered quality jobs, and what sectors are impacted most? Having more jobs is a good thing, but the return of manufacturing without widespread union representation seems to have the potential to undercut the quality of said jobs.
@SenJohnKennedy I agree with your statement. My main questions, as a skeptic of this border wall proposition, are as follows:	1. How does the  @realDonaldTrump campaign promise play into this need? (Politics)	2. Are there more efficient ways that we can spend the $5 billion?	(Infrastructure)
@PressSec @marcthiessen Why is it always about winning and losing?
@JessicaDNelson1 @realDonaldTrump This isn’t right, we are all members of the American society. Tribalism takes away from actual issues and allows for blame to be placed on a group due to misplaced frustration.
@SenSanders @SenSanders Have you tried aggressively ranting your points with a 5th grade level of grammar? Seems to do the trick.
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump How is the pay in the post-union manufacturing sector?
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump Can you please cite your sources?
@SenJohnKennedy I still think “shithole countries” and “grab her by the pussy” take the cake.
@realDonaldTrump You’re quite petty.
@CNN “Steaks,” really?
@realDonaldTrump Death rates from international conflict have fallen drastically over the past century, id say that is a change in global dynamics.
@realDonaldTrump Apples and oranges.
@realDonaldTrump Not a fan of yours by any means, but I do find it odd that the Democratic Party is criticizing you for reducing troop counts in foreign affairs without at least addressing the ideological match with the party’s supposed values.
@SenFeinstein Am I the only one that notices the trend of adding a describing word after making a statement that has become common in politics during the “Trump Era?” It strikes me as juvenile and uneducated, like a poorly written craigslist ad. Immature!
