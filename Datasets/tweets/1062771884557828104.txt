@CNN @Acosta Well are they Hell No. did you hear Chuckie he said that he shutdown the government. He want to get credit for it. The Jew boy needed the publicity.
@TomiLahren @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump Well said young lady. But I don't think she got the message. Look in her eyes totally blank. Talk going over someone's head. That's what we get for the BullShit news media.
@BreitbartNews That dim wit wouldn't No if her ass was bird or punched. When the good lord was handing out brains she thought he said trains a wanted to take the subway to the market.
@maziehirono Yes there is a crisis and it's with the stupid Democrats and their Holly than Tho attitude you all have got. Just remember the Democrats work for the people not the people work for them. Now Get OFF your asses and get to work or get the Hell out and go home.
@maziehirono No, you know he's right and the truth realy sucks don't it.
@nytimes Are you shure?? Better check with your eyes not with a piece of paper. Go down there and check it out before you print BullShit.
@nypost I glad the NYPost can count. Now does the Post have them numbered in order that they were done??? Tell the truth and don't lie.
@Acosta You don't know Jimmy baby. You haven't done you job. Like fact checking.
@Acosta Hay jim get your duds on and go to the border and spend 1 month with border patrol 24/7 and tell the American people there is no problem there. Grow some balls city boy let's see you smoke big boy.
@NBCPolitics @NBCNews What don't the media realy find out for themselves like spending a month with boarder patrol do the same thing those agents. No holds barred. 24/7 no good time and all field work and don't sugar coat anything. I bet they don't have anybody that's has the balls.
@HuffPostPol Let them do their thing.
@joelene_kinard @realDonaldTrump He can't do that that would not with in the law. You don't want him breaking the law. So we'll have you fund the wall. You're a Democrat aren't you. By all means build that wall. Get Queen Nancy to help you.
RT @realDonaldTrump: The Shutdown is only because of the 2020 Presidential Election. The Democrats know they can’t win based on all of the…
https://t.co/DQSVvlD7xA
@DailyCaller Do they realy have the power? I say they don't and never will. What a joke a 15 minute in the spotlight.
@CNNPolitics Let's see what they have to lie and gripe about.
@RandPaul Country and the way people look at us.
@nytimes I think that would be great.
@washingtonpost Listen to what that man says it mite be helpful.
@jaketapper Your polls are so fake you people have never call me or any body in my area in rural Oklahoma to ask us to participate in your polls. You don't ask the older people what they think. Don't you think that stupid not to ask what we think. There are more of us that still vote.
@jaketapper Did you know with the medias help and the negative it will last longer than you think. Just keep up the negativity and watch the happen. Does everybody want to their ratings drop. Then knock off the BullShit and realy report the news like you used to with the BullCrap&amp;Hate.
@NBCPolitics That's good maybe the got a better idea. I dout it but let them speak up. As the BullShit sturs and as the stomach churns. The soap opera continues.
@JohnCornyn https://t.co/soqrhiU5p2
@NBCNews If this network wants to then do it if not just get the Hell off the air way and save your selves money. All the networks care about is rateings and BS. If you hate the Presidential office and don't care about America then turn your switch off and just quit with the crap.
@dbongino https://t.co/Oqhsk3zeyj
@krassenstein Why do you want to boycott Trumps address? It's alrite with me. I'm a Democrat that voted for him for President. I vote for the man not the party. We've needed a business man not a another politician to straighten this country. Trump needs to ask for a balanced budget.
@JohnCornyn https://t.co/pOZcOlnQU4
@JohnCornyn And this man is Jewish what a prick.
https://t.co/MPMoO97Q9f
@ThisWeekABC @GStephanopoulos She is so full of crap.
@NBCNews Yes he can. Do you need proof? Look it up. Damn do people have to do that for you NBC. Make yourself useful and report the real news show the facts.
@thehill Chuckie is a lien SOB and he knows it. It's him and Queen Nancy.
@PeteHegseth You know when the proof is starting to make you pissed. Sorry basturds would rather give some illegal piece of crap the right to vote. It's time to take somebody for a god ol butt kickin and told to get on down the road Your Services are not needed any longer.
@JohnCornyn You and the rest have time to give the President a balanced budget before he ask for it or you give him the Wall. I would ask for both just to be a butthead. But I'm not the President everybody glad I'm not I would realy make your lives miserable.
@EusebioLaracuen @CNNPolitics The enemy is not all the Democrats just the ones that have an agenda with President and the Queen Nancy of them all with her jester Chuckie.
@KamalaHarris Kamala yes the President shut the goverment down. But if the republicans controlled congress as you say then we would have a wall. But it's your party the Democrats that are keeping the goverment shut down with your Queen Nancy that holds the the hammer to drive the last nail.
@DailyCaller And she is a idiot.
@BreitbartNews Hay tell snoop dog to go tell others and go play in the middle of highway while lookin a bone.
@CNN Is CNN going to be handing these out to all their viewers?
@JohnCornyn Dear John, this is to inform you that Queen Nancy is basking in her glory with her gavel and trying to quiet her children down not to disturb her moment while she holds her gavel. Other than that please be patient while rewind the Queen Nancy back to her same old crap. Thank you
@SenSchumer Leave the goverment shut down Chuckie. Don't you like it your still getting paid.
@CNNPolitics It's time to limit congress.
@HuffPost Because it's dumb and it gives the people what they want. Just look who goes to it. I rest my case.
@washingtonpost She don't give a damn. She has an agenda that is to get rid of trump. And the clock keeps ticking the count down to the take over begins.
@KamalaHarris We'll get your fuckin ass down to those tents and take those little basturds and find the parents. Damn quit bitching about this shit. Get off your ass an get it done. Crazy ads California parasite.
@KamalaHarris I hope it goes on for 90 days maybe then congress will see who's got the power to do what they say.  Now get the Hell out of the cat box and quit eating the cat shit.
@thehill Is this girl for real. What a blockhead Charlie Brown.
@realDonaldTrump I have never seen anybody live up to their promise not even the big Drug makers &amp; companies. They played you like a fish and the American public like a vacuum cleaner.
@JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump And the Obamas sewer gets deeper.
@dbongino Your absolutely right and they will do everything to make themselves gods if at all possible. And it Hell with the people of the USA. They rather have us be over run with illegals so they get what they want money&amp;power.
@SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump The wall isn't the Democrats idea it was at one time that was their platform that's what run on for almost 20 years. Now that's somebody else wants to do it they don't want to do it. That's the way they work.
@kefflin @realDonaldTrump @POTUS And you want it for Free don't you.
@ericmarkowitz1 @realDonaldTrump They built the Hoover Dam they can build a wall.
@USATODAY @RashidaTlaib @JohnBonifaz Has this lady thought about what she is saying. She don't have the power or the evidence to impeach the President. She's all talk and full of BullCrap about everything that she says. Two days on the job. She better reconsider what she's saying it could come back to bite her.
@marklevinshow This lady is so full of BullCrap you can smell her like you can smell the piss bag that Hillary Clinton uses under her pantsuits when she's out on a speaking tour.
@RalphNader @jaketapper Hell no they don't need to protest. Your just an instigator and need to keep your mouth shut. You couldn't walk and chew gum.
@realDonaldTrump The Democrats are above the law and all the Democrats political parties are the same. But you Mr President just you are not like that. Their out get you. Your a threat to them and their afraid of you and anybody that's on your side. Don't turn your back on them.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Muslim bitch opened her now has no back bone to back it up with. Open mouth and insert foot.
@RepSwalwell Your o full of crap Eric Swalwell.
@realDonaldTrump Relaxed gamer do you still live in your parents basement or do they have to put a blanket over you when their friends come over.
@realDonaldTrump Brag about it Mr President. This is just pissing the media and congress and all of the Democrats off. They can't take it. But the real truth is just like you said. They just can't leave anything alone. Please give them something to bitch about.
@flossi56 @BreitbartNews Debbie your like me we are getting so use to we think they was sick if they didn't rip us off.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President they're scared of you and what your doing that they won't do. They appropriat money for stuff and someone winds up making off the stolen cash. Beleave me your making them nervous and making them look bad at the same time. LoL, keep up the good work.
@thehill What kinda idiot has Michigan elected. She's a disgrace to the state and office of congress.
@BreitbartNews If the Democrats can see fit to give those countries that hate us money. Then they can fund the wall for national security. Get real people. We're being duped and that's our money. #BuildTheWall
@karenmsilvi @CharMac50 @bjcreigh @realDonaldTrump @cvpayne Quit whining
@realDonaldTrump This bunch of shitheads are not going to give you credit for a damn thing. That's their back stabbing way of doing things. This bunch of Democrats are all about them and not worth a damn. Their all self righteous hollyer than you attitude are the ones that get in trouble more.
@realDonaldTrump @cvpayne Don't let them get to you. A horsesass is a horsesass. The only person that will make you look bad is yourself. Keep the Faith do the best you can and screw the rest. They make themselves look bad. #MAGA.
@nypost This law still remains on the books an not been changed.
@nypost The scarf is nothing, I want to know if she swore in on the Bible and the constitution. If she did not she is invitation of the law and has to be replaced by some one that will. https://t.co/CdXPPV1iCC
@Reuters This should be looked at by the trade commission for monopoly of the big pharmaceutical companies.
@KamalaHarris Yes our country's face Ong a mental illness plague. It's called congress read the laws that have been passed way before your time and follow the laws. Your a lawer aren't you or are you a dumbass.

@washingtonpost The walls are not going to fall down. They will get built just wait and see.
@nytimes He will never do it. He has to take Iran money Russian money and don't for George Soros money. This W. C. Fields quote there's a sucker born every day.
@CNNPolitics Remember Harry he is not a politician he is a business man.
@JeffFromNH @AriFleischer Hay Jeff remember that movie wagg the dog. And all the Presidents men. The Democrats have now on their hands same thing they can't control Trump and he's making them the goat that they are. You have to look out of the box to see the big picture. Put in a neutral position.
@JeffFromNH @AriFleischer Hay jeff why does he need to resign? Give me the reason. Would you resign if you were him. Look at all negativity he's had after he won there was no negative before he even started to run. Did everybody lose their cash betting he would lose &amp; made all those look like fools. Humm
@cnnbrk I hope he puts it on the news media live TV and show the American people just how shit gets done with congress. Watch Ms Nancy's BullCrap and Chuckie BullCrap along with all the rest of the swamp rats give their opinions. #Buildthewall
@CNNPolitics O-Wow this like the trash strike from back in the day. Not!! This is a joke in the eyes of the people. Now for all you bleeding hearts if you don't like it take the trash out your lazyass selves.
@USATODAY Everybody wants trump to resign why? Because he can't be bought he wants what the people want &amp; he's not going to stop till he gets it. So hang on it's going one hell of a ride.
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump @HIASrefugees I bet you don't give away your pay check Ms warren.
@senorrinhatch Mr Hatch job well done sorry to see you go. But you well glad to leave this crap hole they call D.C. Remember you tried to make a difference. So long and good luck in your new life as a civilian.
Why is it just when you think it's safe to come out of the outhouse there is always a Democrat standing at the door waiting to bitch about the President &amp; to see if he wiped he ass with another bill from those illegal loving Democrats.
@ChrisLu44 They need to worry why the democrats go on vacation while they and their families get crapped on.
@DailyCaller He's a pussy

@KamalaHarris It's congresses fault sucking up to big Pharmaceutical companies buying the favers to get the most money for their dope.

@BreitbartNews I can see it now a butt bonkier.
@BreitbartNews So you think Rob. I think Trump will hand her ass to her on a paper plate. And Chuckie baby.
@renegadegreg83 @realDonaldTrump Yes but the pen is miter than the sword remember.
@NBCNews To be realy honest Mueller is a crook himself so every he's been lookin at is not to bring lite to himself or the Clinton's but by deleting the texts that was between one of his own people saying he in the middle ground. And he can't be trusted with a dogs dinner. Think about it.
@Revelation_24_7 @drm608 @CNNPolitics @cnnbrk And I'd give you a binky. Dumbasses real.
@SenFeinstein Well girl do something about it. Get off your ass and get it done. Quit pussyfooting around.

@thehill Because there is no such thing as climate change. All that is BullCrap on the part of Al Gore and his invention of the internet.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President you want to piss those Democrats off make a order to cut off all that aid from those SOB and do it after they come back to DC. Just think of the money we would save for the wall. #BuildtheWall.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Mr Swalwell when was the last time you had the Johnson treatment? Maybe Mr Trump needs to you and Ms Nancy &amp; Chuckie boy a real good as LBJ would say it buttwhippin.
@BreitbartNews Talk about being racist. People are tired of all the BS out of California and their sex discrimination crap the LGBTQ have tried to spew out. Besides the weather is to cold wet and nasty for them. Hay girls wait till summertime for your crap. LoL.
@KamalaHarris At least you carry her on your insurance that's paid by the people of the USA good taxpayers.
@KamalaHarris If the government is like everyone elas they are a month behind which they are so they have money coming up. If they don't over spend more than they made like most people do at this time of the year. They should have signed up for unemployment and should be getting ready first ck

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Well Chuckie if you was standing in front of LBJ you would have your butt knocked on the ground. Just remember that you mite have your wish granted in the form of a asswhippen that you so deserve. Go play golf with the President.
@BreitbartNews Does congress want to know why this happened was cause by trump holding this illegal party under water. Not funny. Build the Wall

@CNNPolitics These two clowns of CNN are so in love with theirselves and spur so much they need to be togather all the time.
@thehill Big F-N deal.
@nytimes Do you think you could talk about something other than a split between a woman's legs. Damn what's this world coming to. Gezzz
@thehill I new that crap would happen. And nobody wants to do their job for the American people. Trump was right sorry basturds thinks of only theirselves.
@HuffPost Nobody gives a damn about what they say. Celebs just running their cockholsters and the lawmakers won't do their jobs they were elected for. The lawmakers need to stay in D.C. Threw the Hollidays And do their jobs that's what they get paid for. They take to much time off as it is
@BreitbartNews Mr Jones, the President is just doing what the Congress has been to the people of the USA for along time. It's about time the table is turned on those pricks. If that was LBJ and congress he would hit Chuckie boy right there in the WH on public tv. He didn't take no crap.
@DailyCaller Wrong!!!! You need to do what is right for the people or resign that's what you were elected for Mr Chuckie.
@BreitbartNews Do you feel the same about the NBA?  Yes or no.
@BreitbartNews You need to know your history alittle better it was Russia that that built the wall they finished up what the Germans started.
@KamalaHarris Trump didn't shut the country the senate &amp; the house did shut it down and you were part of it and you know it. So take responsibility for yourself as part of the problem young lady.
@HuffPostPol It is time for John Kerry to shut the hell up and mind his own business. His opinions are like an A-Hole everybody has got one. Time for him to wipe his mouth he has shit on his lips.
@HillaryClinton No he's not. You got us in to this shit now get us out bitch.
@dakotajag @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/qFh1Iooc0a
@EdKrassen @dakotajag Keep up the good work  border guard. Maybe those basturds will go fucking home. They was paid to come up here now they can their broke asses back to their country.
@realDonaldTrump I would make this shut down last 90 days just to show those buttheads.
@CBSNews Go on home for the ready I've your terms and don't come back pricks.
@NBCNews @NBCLatino No they can do anything they won't to. Even shooting them. Witch I think they should every man woman and child.
@CNNPolitics You know this for a fact. You don't know crap little man.
@DailyCaller You can stick that up your ass.
@JeffFlake The best part of this shut down is that you Mr.Flake won't be here when the congress reconvenes. Praise the lord and pass the biscuits &amp; grave. So take your ass back to snowflake Arizona and stay there.
@KamalaHarris Honey it's partly your fault. Now admit it you and your cronies. Not my President BullShit. You were elected to do a job and you failed big. I hope you have can sleep at night.
@Acosta I can't believe you reported real news. And put the blame where it's do.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump You are joking right?
@KamalaHarris Can you take part of the blame?  I didn't think so that's what democrats do point the finger at someone else.
@KamalaHarris Are you worried about being lynched for something you have done young lady? If I were you I would be.
@BreitbartNews Well Mike you are just going to have to live with it.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Well Ms Nancy, I think you and Chuckie need a Christmas present. Shut the Gov. Down. This will give you and the rest of you people something to think about over as you and the rest of your cronies friends have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. Think about your BullCrap.
@CNBC Get backs are hell aren't they.

@RepSwalwell Why do you want to stay over there Mr swalwell is that what you want to do. We'll get your bags packed you can go over there. It's time to bring these people home Screw those people of the Middle East.
@KamalaHarris You know the shut down is avoidable. Just give the President what he is asking for and everything will be ok. If not #SHUT ITDown as easy as that. Last and final offer bottom line.
@nypost These assholes are so stupid do it do it dumb fucks.  So racist them selves so damn guy and stupid.  Who is doing this shit.
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Eric, Maybe this is what this country and this Congress needs to get off their two bit sorry no go butts and do something for the people of this country and quit worrying about themselves and their stolen money. The no good basturds. Now that's my opinion. Like it or knot.
@BreitbartNews That would make his daughter Rosie O'Donall happy and him to they didn't call him Meathead for nothing on All in the Family.  Make Archie Bunker happy in the words of Archie ( Get Out Here and Shutup).
@WestJournalism @dbongino It's been a joke of the century.

@thehill Maybe he's getting smart or worried about his job.
@business Blame George Soros and the rest of the fat cats.
@nypost Are you shure they won't be racist sexist offensive in anyway to anybody of any country that might be here live here or believes in worship of a rock.
@TheDC_Opinion @DailyCaller @SidneyPowell1 He damn shure did he no better The the Clinton's.
@Reuters This old pot smoker fondly got smart the more you have stoned the more that will vote for you.
@NPR They won't shut down they will just ferlow people the don't need in their offices.
@thehill They can't sue for anything they didn't have any rights in the USA. I for got the democrats have give them the right to do anything they want to. They do have a rite to get the Hell out of here.
@dbongino You tell them. They done made fools out of themselves.
@JudicialWatch Thank Obamas and the Clinton's
@NBCPolitics Good deal.
@ACLU Then why don't the ACLU get off your butts and give those illegal SOBs a country of their own and not my country.
@ChuckRossDC @DailyCaller That SOB hasn't went but to the bathroom and NJ and back.
@KamalaHarris I don't know about you I draw SSI I only draw $12,500 a year and I have a real hard time paying my bills and buying my meds on that. Why don't you do something about that. There is a lot of us that are in the same shape. Do something about SSI &amp; SSA people you want to help.
@nytimes Not if they don't want to. Their on their way out. Why vote for the congress to keep the government funded Hell No. #shut it down. No wall no funds. Merry fuckin Christmas Democrats maybe next year if your lucky. LoL
@AdamSchiff Well you have a lot to say about this. So Mr Adam Schiff are you trying to tell us that you know more than your saying.  Humm maybe we need to check your background for this kinda crap.
@pastormarkburns @SebGorka @realDonaldTrump They don't want to report anything positive. There is no real drama with this. If there was it would be in the news. Ratings is what they won't not the real news.
Have you ever noticed that that almost everyone of the news media is all speculation not hard facts. Speculation has got a many killed in the time of war. This was said by General Patton before he took Germany head on. Never under estimate the enemies before you.
@realDonaldTrump @PeteHegseth @FoxNews He did the world a faver.
@realDonaldTrump Mueller was the head of the FBI and on Clinton's payroll at the time. The fox and the chickenhouse.  Think about it. Mr President
@JudicialWatch I beleave that if Soros was doing this there would be a paper trail of some kind that should be used by the government and the President to bring him to justice.
@BreitbartNews Nancy you are not going to get shit. Dumbass
@BreitbartNews Your so full of shit.
@KamalaHarris Isn't that great now we will get the same insurance that the congress gets for free meds and all.  Isn't that great Kamala.
@BreitbartNews How did he do that lady and can you prove anything.
@NBCNews LGBTQ is trying to get the mental job done. What a joke.
@CNN @CNNOpinion I'm surprised somebody is not offended and want this tore down.
@SenBlumenthal Did that make you mad because he didn't ask you to go with him?? Well why didn't you ask him to go are you just bitching about the BullCrap.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President you can give me a job workin for you if you please I'm not doing anything but drawin my SSA could use the money. I'm a used to be truckdriver and any job will work for me jack of all trades master of none. An office job would be nice to have. Thank you
@KamalaHarris Why don't you right a bill to give all Americans this same care that congress gets free the same  care as you get.
@KamalaHarris Kamala have you ever thought of being a bail bondsman in stead of a congressman? Maybe that's your calling.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President all they want to do is break a story about you because are so jealous of you it sucks just ignore these peaces of shit and go on about your business. Been a pleasure talk to you Sir.
@KamalaHarris We'll get your ass down there and get it done or are you so lazy you can't.
@NancyPelosi Shut up Nancy, you don't know what your talking about. Get back in your bottle of booze and snort you another line of cocain. Dumbass.
@StevenTDennis @BretBaier This is so full of shit.
@stark_talk @mkraju @PamelaBrownCNN Don't do it Mr President it's a trap. I wouldn't let Mueller interview my dog. Lien basturd.
@BuzzFeedNews @BretBaier So was Obama care was illegal look how many got kicked off it.
@BuzzFeedNews @BretBaier That federal judge is so full of himself. Blow more smoke up peoples asses why don't you.
@RandallBelcher1 @AdellNorwood I don't know how the president is stealing money when he don't even take a paycheck. He has his own money and that's why all these assholes are so made about. He does not steal from the people like everybody else does congress,the Clinton's, Obamas, Mueller, ECT ECT and on &amp; on.
@ABCWorldNews @Clayton_Sandell Ask Hillary.she may have had her vomit suicide and bury herself.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President that not what the democrats want you are sposed to lie cheat and steal like the real political bunch do. Your never going to get rich if you don't. LOL
@thehill Big FN deal your just want something to bitch about. Shut the F up and give some real news about the crap the congress is doing.
@AnnCoulter That's because they are racist.
@NancyPelosi Shut up Nancy.
@KamalaHarris I think you could have stopped this only if you would have taken that lit girl home with you. Admitting it's your falt.
@JudicialWatch He lied about that to.
@dsamuelsohn @politico Their coming in the back way!
@CNN They are never sorry for doing anything. Put this lit asshole in jail for exposing everybody.
I think there should be campaign money investigation on all members of congress. If it's good for the President it's good for congress. Let's see how many have used their money wisely.
@KamalaHarris Medicare is supposed to be for the older generation when they can't afford health insurance. What don't you find something elas.
@TimAeppel This is so much BullCrap. Clean up your own back yard. Don't clean up someone's back yard.
@JeffFlake It's time to go back to snowflake and breathe in the real dirt not the BullCrap of D.C.
@politico Coming from from the Enquirer this is going for more BullShit and a kiss an tell story of wow. Get real!!
@KamalaHarris I know why you won't support it. But it would be in your best interest that you do. You talk a lot of crap California girl. You and the rest of the Democrats your jobs may depend on it. Don't be a moon beam brown.
@KamalaHarris Not No but Hell No.
@thenation Keep up the good work China. Now that's border control
@DailyCaller @realDonaldTrump Is for Russian mueller BS or his own BS. Which has anything to do Russian BS.
@KamalaHarris Did you know that SSA people pay almost 25% of the income for Medicare &amp; more for secondary insurance to go with it. That takes away their money for copayments for their meds. It's eather pay their bills or meds &amp; hopefully they get to buy food. As for me I have $35 dollars 2 eat
@dbongino They wish in one hand and shit in the other for all the good it will. LoL
@KamalaHarris Why don't you make a bill so the government can make marijuana legal across a America where we can grow it sell it smoke it use it for money raise our kids with it let those drug dealers in jail can get out for dealing it. Come on Kamala Harris do your job lady. Let's get real!!!
@KamalaHarris There is no such thing as climate change. There is no such thing as global warming. There is a such a thing as BullCrap and I can prove it have you ever been to a farm where there was cows eating and crapping in the pasture. That is real not climate change.
@FaceTheNation @realDonaldTrump @RepAdamSchiff We'll see.
@Epicurus_1 @BBCWorld I see what you mean but the world does not work in that manor. That is why we have the wind and the atmosphere we have. It cleans it self if not we would have been all dead long before now.
@stevenmortense1 @NBCNews Korea was a police action congress didn't sign off on it and the same for 911.
@Samoset59 @GreggJarrett Thank you I sand revised.
@KamalaHarris Tell me if you could live on a living wage. If so take a cut in your paycheck. Give up your lifestyle. Better yet work for nothing for 1yr and tell me again.
@EndDeportations You are talking about Democrats. Liberalism is just a word it had nothing to do with anything but BS. Find out who realy gave you all this BullCrap you say you got. Don't hope and dream of what could be get out and do something even if it means failure. Do it right the first time
@thwwordsmith @HuffPostPol I maybe insane but I am a card caring Democrat as you would call old school. I vote for the person not the party. So that makes me crazy like a fox. But I'm out spoken and don't sugar coat for NoOne.
@NBCNews Saround yourself with and you we'll be young forever.
@BBCWorld Why cut carbon dioxide that's part of the air we breath the rain that's coming down are these people nuts. This thing is what makes our planet what it is today. Just NoBrains.
@NBCNews They are not kidding.
@RayRaySoundBite @AP It's none of our business what they do. We need to mind ower on business. This is my way of thinking. If you put your nose in you could get it cut off.
@NEWS9 Okies will get over it.
@thehill He will never know.
@CNN @marcorubio We have done it before. Get real!!!
@NBCNews @NBCNewsMACH I believe if it had ice on this planet that close to the sun it would be thawed out by now. LoL
@CNN Was study done by some fool that wants to tell everybody how they have and die. While their smoking a joint and drinking T-Bird wine while the play with their selves dreaming of some man/woman going done on them. If this is the case CNN has fit the bill of are you an idiot. LOL
In the day of high technology I have realized that all the people that hated typing in school now does it more &amp; more. And for all the dope smokers &amp; drunks of the 60s&amp;70s the so called hippies have come to the establishment way of thinking. LOL let's smoke&amp;drink to the WOC.
@cnni This study is so full of shit.
@PurlLeslie @thwwordsmith @realDonaldTrump Just remember you can put that shifter in N for no where at all. LoL
@NBCNews @NBCNewsBETTER Now go out and buy all this crap and go broke doing it. Remember your the dumbass you have to be told everything to do eat sleep and what makes you happy. Fool!!!!
@NBCNews These kids are just doing what they hear and see. This is not the parents fault it's the way the school teachers fault they can't teach reading writing or math&amp;history.
@TIME They don't know a damn thing plus they are so full of shit they reake from the smell.
@USATODAY He's a joke anyway. An old has been and doesn't have a job anyway.
@nytimes Dear mother, let her go be what ever she wants to be with your blessings. Tell her she is also she can be multi raceual to so she can be that to. Put her things on the curb and tell her she can go and make it on her own. Give her $20 bucks and a have good life.
@NBCNews Well Canada you always wanted a real war. Here's your chance.
@BreitbartNews Sense when does anybody leason to some dumbass from Hollywood. Get real people this is Rosie O-Donnells father. Better known as the meathead.
@NBCNews He crapped to if you believe that I have this bridge to Hawaii I want to sell cheap.
@BreitbartNews She is so much a Hippocrat. Talks real big to be so small. This is how she got her way in to congress thanks to her sugar daddy. LOL. She got her kicks on this matter.
@HuffPostPol He just does want to be the goat to realy take the fall for the BullShit that's went down. He's scared shitless of the Democrats and the real Boss George Soros and the Clinton's.
@KamalaHarris No it's not most of these people have never been in a sewer like this before in their lives.
@BreitbartNews She must be humming this kid. Bust her butt now.
@MarshallCohen @mkraju Let's see his smoke.
@SenFeinstein @sarcasticfem23 I wonder how much she's going to make off this nomination?
@lcastrorecio @Sarahickling1 @nytimes @Lawrence You know that and I know that. But this Democrat Congress thinks they can do anything they want to do.  Just watch an see.
@Zachary_Scotty @sarcasticfem23 @AngrierWHStaff You know this and the Democrats no this and so does everybody elas. So let's see them smoke the real weed of politics.
@GreggJarrett Your right they are just kids they have never been there.
@realDonaldTrump @ArmyWP_Football You did that like a real President should have. And the game was just that a good game. Now it's time to get down to being a President not a businessman get going time to stand your ground with congress and don't give an inch till you get what you want and the people need aleader
@NBCNews @NBCNewsMACH What the Hell!!! Are you doing? This bunch is trying to cause poisoning to the land &amp; the people.
@KamalaHarris Kamala why don't you practice what you preach. You can make a difference but you don't want to. It's all about the money isn't it. You can pull the wool over someone elas eyes but I'm callin you on the way your doing the way your do.  Think about it little girl you are a brat.
@HuffPost I hope this man has hit every SOB in the balls or cunt what ever be the case. Now they can just get over it buttholes.
@melkor325 @HannahW31720999 @realDonaldTrump Do you think France needs to step up and do more killing or what? Give your opinions
@BreitbartNews Congress is wanting to and is going to impeach him on any grounds they can think of those sorry no good basturds. They wanted Hillary so fuckin bad to keep the same old shit going on. Now I've said what's on my mind. These freeloading bunch assholes can kiss mine.
@AP_Oddities I'll bet this man was paid to do this. Plus he probably a Democrat with a vindictive reason.
@BreitbartNews But this man said they were felonies does have any proof. The answer is No.
@HuffPost This to sexiest for children make her stop.
@NBCNews Maybe make maybe it'll make Phoenix white. LoL
@ipdmail This is a joke. Right
@JudicialWatch Ask Hillary about that.
@USATODAY That's great!!
@realDonaldTrump Nobody is wanting to comment to anything.
@SaraCarterDC Me too Me too.
@SaraCarterDC She is lieing and she knows it. Now let her tell us another lie.
@BreitbartNews They needed to be damaged.
@BreitbartNews Yes we know black men that sleep with white men only sake hands with in bed.
@mattymonsterz @MarcitaZa She don't want to spend her ill gotin money.
@mattymonsterz I don't think even half of these people will let go of the money to run for President. Most can't afford to because they haven't made a mark on their Congressional status or don't have the mentally to do the job. Trump ran as a joke bet with a friend.
@dbongino Mueller has been with the CIA and the FBI and he can't any connection with Russian or anything elas. He's just drawing a paycheck. What a dumbass. Couldn't find his ass with a compass.
@Pattern There is no such thing as global warming or climate change. Get for real why don't you.
@NancyPelosi Ms Pelosi you need to do your job and quit feeling sorry for people who care if they become Americans or not. Their just trying to ride that gravy train they have been ridding every sense they come here as babies or not. They are still illegals no matter how you say it. Get tuff.
@NancyPelosi They have had more than enough time to get their crap straight why don't they want to do the right thing with theirselves or are just lazy. America love it or leave it. You don't to be apart of it get the Hell Out!!
@LawWorksAction I think that mueller's investigation has been a joke gone bad so why not end this and save the taxpayers money. If congress wants to impeach trump so be it. But they better have good cause.
@DailyCaller @donlemon @ChrisCuomo He cheep and small. He has his on way of thinking. He's thinks he's to good to shake hands with the President. Why don't he just not go there POS. Boot licker black boy.
@BreitbartNews Rosie you need to keep your mouth shut.
@BreitbartNews Why apologize it's the truth and kid rock just callin a spade a spade. That's just the way he feels.
@NBCNews Well they finally got the Ebola virus all most protected but not quite. The UN and its band of marry men/women workin real hard on total global deviation.
@KRMGtulsa The courts just need to flush this turd. Call Mullin plumbing and get this sewer rat down the drain and gone.
@BreitbartNews This woman is full of BullCrap she is starting to stink. How does listening to her talk make the real people put up with that crap.
@DailyCaller And the BullCrap gets deeper. Why does Big Al live in mansion and why does he fly a private jet ride in a gas hog limo every where he goes. Does cause global warming climate change excuse me for usein global warming. People are so brain damaged they will believe any. Don't figure
@CNN This will be the next bunch of migrants to be shipped here to our shores.
@JudicialWatch The Democrats have to have someone to take the fall when when they steal all the money and run. Just watch what I say.
@DailyCaller There is something wrong with this. I smell set up. I think Mr Mueller is grasping at straws and threaten everybody with everything just make him look good and get convictions on people who had anything to do with Trump. He got a vendetta and so does the democrats and Hillary.
@migold What's so ironic this is a sign that was used by the native Indians as a sign of peace ant a German sign. This so stupid by some people.
@tomselliott This man stopped all the drilling when was in office. What a bunch of BullCrap.
@AllynCaldwell4 Hay kidO glad to see ya.
@KRMGtulsa What is wrong with young women to day they hate their kids. I guess that child takes to much of their time they need to play&amp;apart with their friends. That times is over with when you want to raise a family. Most of these young need to growup. Welcome to the real world.
@CNN Most small towns in Oklahoma get their water from rivers and creeks not many of them have water wells like they use to their getting to big as everything does.
@BreitbartNews If she can't believe that this realy happens she has led a sheltered life in the basement of somebody's house. Get real she is so fake even as abog time actress. Life is not a fantasy like most shallow minded people believes. What a joke.
@Surabees @HannahW31720999 @realDonaldTrump Yes, that's a fact.
@SenSchumer Well my friend if congress does nothing and you should that's what we the people elected you all for to represent the people and do the right thing on our be half. Remember all it takes is somebody with the nads to get the job done. Must be nice to draw money for nothing. G-R-D.
@AndrewB47992377 @HannahW31720999 You said a mouth full. LOL.
@cnni I'm glad they did. Next time we need to shot Oder their heads with live ammo.
@BreitbartNews Maybe you can be the next Hillary. She needs the competition. The both of you are a joke in the bathrooms.
@Harolddbates @HannahW31720999 It's not it's away of life. I sorry, you miss under stood my meaning.
@DailyCaller This is a joke right?
@dbongino This man needs to be held more accountable than anybody in DC. The biggest fake in the world.
@BreitbartNews Their so self centered with their trivial little lives. They can't believe that he is.
@DailyCaller Shouldn't have been charged to start with. Just doing his job at his best.
@nytimes Good Ol George Soros stricken again.
@DailyCaller @HillaryClinton Sense when has she ever had anything to say. She thinks she's President and she expects everybody to do what she says. She needs to get a life and shut the hell up.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President you no this will never happen they want this country to fall and fail so somebody elas can make the decision. Congress has failed and now wants the UN to control The World Order and money. They don't to do the job they was elected for.
@nytimes They have quit education women on child brith &amp; care for both them &amp; the child. 90% of the young women want someone to tell them what what to do. There is no better person than their parents doing this. That's is what's wrong no up bring in this matter. Blame the Government&amp;media
@BreitbartNews That's alright it just another day ask the military, the cops and the truckers and the rest of the real world.
Why is there nobody protecting Black Friday the most Racist day of the year. When poor people have no money and the Rich have money to buy Christmas for themselves. This is Racist and Bigitory at its finest. Come on people don't damn fools.
@dbongino This is an invasion form other countries for the UN and others to take over the USA by means of force. Their have everything they need to wage war against the USA. They have food water medicine and yes they are armed. It's time to do the dirty dead on American soil.
@JudicialWatch It's like putting the Fox in the chicken house full of chickens.
@BreitbartNews Mr your part of the the NWO club you need to just up and don't say anything you will have to answer for.
I'm so sick of everybody bitching and griping about trump this and trump that. This man is a business man not a politician. He don't take any pay for his service nor does he need it he's a billionaire business man trying to turn this country around for the better for all People.
@JudicialWatch @townhallcom The MNM
@BreitbartNews She didn't make any mistake.
@BreitbartNews Rob keep on melting down Archie would want you to. Meathead
@FLOTUS @WhiteHouse Thank you for the invite.
Happy to be here.
