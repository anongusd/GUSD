@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar This MAGAt keeps projecting. Needs to take his lecture to disposable soldiers in red states happy to punish federal workers &amp; immigrants because of imaginary alien invasions to favor the billionaire's club who stroke their ego with flattery.  Haunted by their past &amp; inner demons.

@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar Buzz off, Magat.  Continue being a mental midget and disposable soldier.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar You will not be a problem for much longer.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar That is BS. Tell your dealer to give you a stronger hit. It was indefensible and criminal.  Another crime of yours with no consequences.  Anyone allowed to kill and steal without consequences will excel faster for a while until karma catches up.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar Why do you need to come to Africa to rob it of its minerals and natural and human resources? Why is this not on your crime chart? If being criminal and a murderer makes you genius, why do you say you want to lock up criminals?
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar Would you like to give another group license to rape, rob, and kill your people for 400+ years to make the point of effect?  I guess Faux 5 passes as real news to you Magats
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar If you clearly state that you leave things out, that you put Black and Latino numbers together conveniently to make your case, then you define killing to leave out your killing then of course.  This is what they say they are doing, not me
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar The weak fight to keep a head start like you do. White privilege is all you White supremacists push. Why are you the only ones preventing equal opportunity if you are not weak &amp; insecure?
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar Extra points for being Black? Where?  Studies show a White ex-con getting less resistance than a Black college student.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar Built out of fairness? You mean genocide is fair? Against those who could have killed you? Then slavery and exploitation?
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar I would call that unfair.  But you won't join the resistance like John Brown. You prefer to fight the other oppressed people instead of the .1%. Why?  Because they tell you they like you for being White like them? You want more of the spoils of war, our countries are under attack
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar Mitch McConnell has presided over an area red as blood that elects him to take care of rich white people.  The poor white people there are content to hear Mitch McConnell attack immigrants &amp; people with melanin, pose in front of confederate flags, &amp;use them as disposable soldiers
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar Taking away your advantages is not unfair and racist. Neither is telling the truth.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar White intervention?  You mean Black intervention to build European and American infrastructure.  The design of Washington DC and the obelisks? Compare it to Kemet. The convict leasing system was the public works for America.  The Moors brought civilization to Europe
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar As I stated, chattel slavery was different because it crossed generations and made you property and classified you as less than human.  As a rule you could not work your way up. It was the basis of the Western economics. Look it up.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar If a system is organized White theft, murder, and crime, why would White people need to move outside of that system to commit criminal acts when they have the system as a cloaking device, and what does that make you when things are rigged to favor you and you are still poor?
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar Then you have the audacity to apply the idea of this being a meritocracy. Studies show it is based on inherited blood money.  I can list law after law &amp; policy after policy aimed at giving Whites subsidies &amp; privileges denied Black ppl they disparage &amp; disadvantage
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar The FBI databases you quote admittedly eliminates about 15,696 known homicides, and are counting certain types of homicide. Not to mention, there are killings that are not classified as homicide because institutions &amp; those in power do it under the pretense of business as usual.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar ...then when talking about your vulgar behavior toward others historically, you call it good because somehow murder when applied by you is good while it is crime for others.  If you hold powers of the state and kill others, somehow it is not a crime because you say so. Yaawn.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar As I said, I am not doing extensive research to present to you when you are not operating in good faith.  You will get backhanded, flip responses.  Your stereotypes project evil on everything with melanin.  To justify your savagery, you try to invent savagery on our part...
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar How about search for your soul, carcass, return to your cave or learn to live with all the other groups on earth.  Everyone else is not wrong and you right.  Respect those who brought you here. Out compete?  Last I heard, you were disappearing.  Hence the Magat act.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar Other groups amassed large armies and large scale war in your way because all it takes is one homicidal maniac to make all other groups get strapped up and get armed.  Other groups built civilizations to address human problems &amp; improve life.  Better? Bright red coats?  Right.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar Not all civilizations make war, organized theft, and slavery central to their economic systems/development.  An example is the group of people who gave us the name Vandals.  In Europe, being a worker was shameful while it was an honor in all other continents.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar People who kill individuals in their own communities are punished.  All communities commit crimes of proximity more.  Police killings are not punished.  They are sent to other departments, given paid vacations, protected by the police union.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar You look immediately at those committing crime.  The test of the system is when you look at those who follow it and see that they are still punished by it. That is the litmus test for when the system works.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar It is clearly documented that unarmed Black people who do not resist have been executed and clearly documented that Whites are handled with kid gloves even when armed and fighting police.  Mass shooters, mafia dons, and serial killers are writing books and films
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar Rockefeller drug laws, anyone? Crack &amp; cocaine.  Same drug.  Different sentencing Crack mostly Black.  Crack punished more.  Also, when it is white the tone has always been treatment and legalization.  When Black, it is incarceration.  This switch happened 2x historically.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar Your "culture" is noted for having the longest rap sheet.  Read history again. The Powhatans who pulled your smelly carcass out of the seas and taught you how to survive were slaughtered.  You were eating each other and the horses.  The same was true everywhere else you appeared
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar Your community puts the most resources behind trap music.  Check where most of the money for it comes from.  The White corporations as documented in Hollywood Shuffle tried to twist HipHop to do their bidding.  Real HipHop is still out there doing what it originally did.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar Where do the statistics for crimes of genocide committed by Magats and their predecessors show up? The wars for resources paraded as terrorism?  The police assassinations of unarmed Black people? A book Medical Apartheid documents killings done by the medical institution.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar White crimes are underreported including genocide. -45 stopped federal investigation into police dept corruption.  Most crime in oppressed groups are as a direct result of desperation created by institutionalized racism studied &amp; reported from Kerner commission until now.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar The reason you are tone deaf to people in that situation is because you suffered the same thing?  Rewind and come again.  I am able to see what others experience because I was there.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar You are the one who used stereotypes to justify police brutality.  This is called projection.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar Maggat.  Asians and Indians got reparations, so did Jews.  White people got blood money.  Read.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar The Eastern European slave trade is alive and well Magat.  It is not an Arab or African creation.  Chattel slavery was a European creation.  Ancillary slavery was in every society to repay debt or for punishment for crime.  You were not property, but could work your way up. Read.
Capitalism and what it does to humanity.		https://t.co/vflkH4chHJ
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar If indeed you learned to read, you should pick it up.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar Oh, and I forgot one part of your typical weak-minded response of using stereotypes rather than reality to explain things.  The New Jim Crow documents the bias in the criminal justice system. Differential sentencing, incarceration, brutality, genocide and profiling rates.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar On a positive note for the listeners, NY dropped racial profiling, and crime dropped. Data showed that white people possessed more contraband and weapons than Black people, yet Black people were stopped more and arrested more.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar To answer your last point about being a victim, I am not encouraging anyone to be a victim.  Taxpayers pay these people. We are demanding that someone yank the chains of the dogs set on our people.  But dogs who behave rabid this way are past the point of being reasoned with.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar When I was a kid, people who had head starts never bragged about winning a race.  This is what people like you try to go on social media to do.  Even with white privilege &amp; head starts, in most categories with your rigged measuring tactics, your crime is the same rate or higher.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar We are not serial killers and we don't commit mass shootings for sport, the crimes of poverty committed by people under attack and sanctioned by their own government or due to mental illness not treated is not a crime of privilege.
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar I didn't answer you to argue with you because you can tell when someone is not moving in good faith, &amp; I don't throw pearls to swine.  However, history documents that white oppressors built their fortunes on war crime, and define criminality based on the color of the perpetrator
@jazzurd @ATLBlackStar White serial killers, mass shooters, and even animals are taken in safely.  This was a person known to be battling mental illness, and police were alerted on the call that he had a knife.  Police responding to calls involving Black suspects are always seeking excuses to kill.

@ThatBOL_Fox Difference bet. a win 4 global PanAfr struggle &amp; FB tantrums is 1 alienates global Blk allies thinking 16 % Amerikkka IDing as Black will win with1 emotional outburst or hope 2 b accepted by Whites after helping them kill other Black people.  Emotion is good servant, poor master
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump This is the birther thing all over again.
@realDonaldTrump You want law and order for those trying to survive the oppressive policies and practices of you and the other oligarchs and plutocrats highjacking the government. Yet you obstruct law and order when it involves investigation into your ongoing corruption and collusion with Russia.
@realDonaldTrump Savage White supremacists you are elevating to positions of power daily have a long history of domestic terrorism and organized crime. Everyone in your administration is corrupt and tied to dirty money, racism, white supremacy, and rape.
@WXII @Atlking404BPC1 Every time this happens there should be consequences for both the cops who entertain the caller and the caller.
@ThatBOL_Fox 2 fronts of the same war. Family quarrels can wait in a burning house.
@MuslimIQ A young Black child showing interest in entrepreneurship seen as a threat meanwhile they complain we are lazy.  It shows you that it is not about what we do, but war with us as a people, even our children.
@TeamPelosi @Sharon1943 ...and yet you think impeachment is a waste of time.  You need to be removed or grow a spine.
@JoyAnnReid @jonathanjewel This is just the beginning unless #THERESISTANCE gets ready to answer.
@realDonaldTrump Maybe the corporate money oligarchs should stop destabilizing countries abroad and local communities for greed.  The resources in a country belong to those who live there.  When you hoard and steal the resources of another country, it is not within your right to keep them out.
@EdKrassen There needs to be consequences for actions like these.
Oligarchs who were hiding behind the Trojan horse of religion are starting to get more militant against Black people, pushing for global White Supremacy. Build PanAfrican coalition. Whites are indigenous to no land mass and yet globally they bellow loudly for foreigners to leave.
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump The Republicans are taking off the mask.  They used to hide behind the veil of religion and conservativism.  Now it is clear as day that they have no religion but greed and White supremacy.

@maggieNYT 45, Fooliani, 666, etc should be treated to the conditions they prescribe for Blk and brown youth in ICE, Prison industrial complex in USA,  military industrial complex, and occupied territories.  Don't put his head down when he and the other "animals" will arrested.
@realDonaldTrump Why didn't you and 666 support or enforce Russian sanctions the Obama administration proposrd and passed.  In fact you and Congress were too busy putting out pictures of Putin on horseback saying he was more presidential than Obama.
@realDonaldTrump Malcom X: Stick a knife in my back 9 inches and pull it out 6 inches, No progress. Pulling it all the way out is not progress. Progress is healing the wound the blow made. You haven't even pulled the knife out much less healed the wound. You won't even admit the knife is there.
@realDonaldTrump What about the Russian people who travel to trump tower to have babies thereby getting US citizenship? ttps://www.thedailybeast.com/russians-flock-to-trump-properties-to-give-birth-to-us-citizens
@charliekirk11 Why aren't you and 45 trying to sanction Russia for hacking? 45 is saying Obama should have done more. Obama tried to sanction Russia, but 45 who desperately wants to be one of the Russian oligarchs stopped it because he and his son in law 666 needed a Russian bank for loan $
I am putting together a directory of Black businesses, wholesalers, and institutions that meet all community needs. Independence is the 1st step to liberation. People who don't have our interests can't control our vital institutions #blackinfrastructure
John Boehner and other Republicans benefit from Marijuana sales while this hypocritical White supremacist system locks up desperate Black youth who they have helped to sabotage financially https://t.co/VHb1nMS6JQ
@realDonaldTrump 45 commits crimes openly and then stereotypes people with melanin, calling them criminals. He challenges law enforcement.  His son in law 666 who can't get a security clearance because of corruption puts political pressure on countries that won't give him money to pay his debts
@tariqnasheed @N4tTurner Are they able to zoom in on this to see faces or is there a clip with a plate?

#JoyAnnReid Lioness, as I told you when we met in person in Manhattan, thank you for your work. You are an important voice above ground in resistance hence the attacks on you.
@SpeakerRyan You can't even hold your own regime accountable
@SpeakerRyan Career Republ want 2 work 4 elites funding them. Hence tax cuts/laws rob main st, corporate wars overseas 4 other ppls resources.
Should have said executive branch here as well, but that goes without saying I guess
...but services r left undone by vital organs/institutions failing.  Need to use or bypass system to get it done.
#consequences for white supremacist cops, vigilantes, politicians &amp; corporate elites that r responsible for global theft &amp; underdevelopment
@amjoyshow @MsTaraDowdell True. Condemn and counteract.  We need a triple bypass after House/Senate/Congress White supremacist coup.
@OhioLatinx Murderer who hides &amp; 1 who is hidden is still a murderer. Question is what we do about it. Flipside is why are they getting bolder now?
@blaclives @amjoyshow @JoyAnnReid @CNN Shows dysfunction of 45s supporters.  Animals fighting 4 a kill. Pastor Green &amp; Omarosa r on the menu, but think they're invited 2 dinner.
Where is the triple bypass following White Supremacist coup of the House/Senate/Judiciary?  Autopsy of US will reveal this was necessary.

White supremacists try to destroy Blk countries/communities w/ their policies &amp; then try to bar their immigration and policies to remediate.
@realDonaldTrump The Republicans behave like animals at a carcass.  Apex predator Kochs/Mercers take the biggest piece. Nazi deplorables=scavengers.

@Katie_Speak Disunity in GOP.  The base is fooled by fake religion and hate.  Ruling corporate elite tries to hide the fact that their greed is 1st.
@FeministaJones Our working ppl and spiritual institutions should build independent infrastructure. We have skills/ talent, but someone else owns our labor.
@BlackToLive Without this system of underdevelopment, there would be more like her. https://t.co/gDCh0aNtqO.
@BlackToLive We need 2 make the pigs pay the ultimate price equal 2 the offense, and to build, own, and support distribution chains.  Police ourselves.
@BlackGirlGeeks True, check out book Medical Apartheid.
