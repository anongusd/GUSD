#sotu response as mannequin challenge https://t.co/vkgj5BJnom
Am guessing if Abrams runs for statewide office again in 2020, she doesn't get overshadowed by other down-ballot Dems like she did in 2018 (Beto and Gillum).
put him in a diner (Beshear)! Have him walk into a room (Jindal)! Put him in a statehouse (McDonnell)! Put a bunch of people in the background  (Abrams)!
Politicians have been giving #SOTU responses for decades and still nobody (from either party) knows what the setting should look like.

@chrisFnicholson @NickRiccardi @tombellin ... pretty good chance the Dems nominate a presidential candidate who isn't white		regardless, i would - politely - disagree.
@NickRiccardi @tombellin @chrisFnicholson that's the most daunting big-picture assessment of pushing a single-payer system (if you actually got in a position to pass it): Obamacare elicited a ferocious backlash, and its scope was minuscule compared to these proposals

@Taniel @ShaneGoldmacher @DemFromCT @NickRiccardi to that point: if we're talkingabout some sort of median voter of the american electorate, the Democrats won that guy or gal (and then some). 		the thing we're simultaneously finding out is that there really aren't that many of those median voters in Iowa or Ohio anymore (or fl?)
@ShaneGoldmacher @NickRiccardi @DemFromCT Meg Whitman's candidacy feels like a long, long time ago. 		One of the first events I wrote about a national political reporter was a debate between her and JB. Think @RonBrownstein asked me to do it. But people thought she had a real shot!
@NickRiccardi @ShaneGoldmacher tbh i can't muster the animus the election is over and i just watched the steelers win by 31 points.
@ShaneGoldmacher @NickRiccardi ah that makes sense. that was a high bar, but it's one clearly not cleared (or even close).		a little too much agreement here tho you want to yell at each other in a good ol' fashioned twitter fight?
@NickRiccardi @ShaneGoldmacher true, though man, it's hard for me to imagine Dems relying exclusively on winning WI-PA-MI for the presidency.		PA, I could see that getting away from Trump. But the other two could be really damn close.
@NickRiccardi @ShaneGoldmacher that's a good way of looking at it.		could argue that the distressing thing for Dems even in areas I think they can consider big-pic successes -- Texas and Georgia -- is they still face a ceiling there that sits below a winning margin
@ShaneGoldmacher ehhh, i'd be more on board with this if it were a narrow House majority. But we're looking at Ds picking up ~40 seats
@LPDonovan one question i'd like to see answered: are we seeing Montana swing a bit left? State always had some Dem DNA but always an assumption was it was heading the way of Wyoming. But the House result suggests maybe not?
@LPDonovan people don't still don't seem to realize magnitude of House wins, and I swear it's because McGrath fell off just as it became clear Scott/DeSantis were favorites and JD was getting thrashed.
@LPDonovan the first wave of results distorted everything, in ways detrimental to both sides

@HotlineJosh my favorite example from that era is actually Tom Marino -- he talked openly about cutting Social Security benefits for *existing beneficiaries* It's the ultimate no-no in politics, especially in that district. ... he won easily

also hard to miss the parallel to 2010, when tea party candidates gained strength toward the end of primary season. Between Gillum and Pressley, that appears to be the case with Dems now

@JamesWise5 i agree it's a bunch of generalized, 30,000-foot discussion that's short on real answers. which is sorta my point -- there's usually nothing vague about advocating for those sorta cuts.		I don't think saying that more people should work equates with cuts, the "ramps" ...
if you want to argue that the GOP's tax cuts have ballooned the deficit, and that the party will soon look to entitlement cuts to balance that out, OK, that's an argument (and one Dems will use a fair bit this fall, probably).		but, eash, it's not in this interview

approach makes sense, especially if you anticipate (correctly) a coming effort from Democrats to attack the failed GOP health care bill, which will itself likely be aimed at seniors by criticizing the Republicans proposed "age tax"
GOP pushback to 'Medicare for All' -- if this new Tenney ad is an indication -- will push idea that it will undermine existing Medicare program, i.e. be aimed directly at seniors https://t.co/hOZKk7JJ8J

all of that might go up in smoke in 2020, at least for the primaries and possibly the general too. but generally speaking, Dems and their activist base are pretty united when it comes to the midterms -- in a way that appears consequential for the results
... who are the only ones getting in on the action -- the Dem AG group is also involved. There's certainly friction between the 'establishment' and activists, but at least right now, there's also an (unexpectedly?) large amount of tangible cooperation ahead of November

Dem source emails this quote, which pretty aptly summarizes the feeling inside the Democratic Party after yesterday's primaries:		“Saturday’s are still for the boys, but Tuesday’s are for the ladies”
@trowaman @DarthJeff90 can't speak as much to that ( @cam_joseph has reporting to back it up ). tbh, most of this "analysis" is just guess-work. you try to make reasonable assumptions but really who knows
@trowaman @DarthJeff90 that Ashford wouldn't have had -- which could help a lot with money. 		i think, at first blush, there's some reason for concern among Dems. but these races are also mostly about national political environment, and the nat environment is still good for Dems so ...
@trowaman @DarthJeff90 eastman will have complications that Ashford wouldn't have -- specific support for tax increases isn't great politics (no duh). and ashford, if nothing else, had proven he could win		but also Eastman is new to politics at a time when voters value that. and she'll have a prog base
An argument from @DarthJeff90 that Eastman shouldn't automatically be considered a weaker candidate than Ashford https://t.co/v9IqGAvbIF
@scottdetrow he's a proven vote-getter!
@EricJafMN usually 'quietly' helping means directing donors her direction or offering strategic advice. idk, maybe a poll or two?
(in the interest of fairness Corbett, at the time, was also engaged in a high-profile public corruption investigation that netted lots and lots of positive media -- so it wasn't as if his success that year was purely because of JM's poor campaign)
i'd add that this source's view of Morganelli is how many in-state party leaders have viewed JM for the last decade. And they have prior evidence, like when he lost to Tom Corbett by seven points in 2008 while Obama was carrying the state by *10* https://t.co/SGH6QO2JVx
@SeanMcElwee it certainly does
@KaylieEHanson indeed, he was not seen as a reliable vote for Democrats if in office, which is not how the party sees most of the other quote-un-quote "conservative" and "centrist" candidates it backs
source -- who is not with the DCCC and was not involved with any of the candidates in #pa07 -- also says he saw the d-trip quietly back Wild, the eventual winner.

RT @greggiroux: #ne02 Dem primary (Eastman-Ashford) https://t.co/4AbrLN5AOK
@nick_field90 @JonathanTamari keeps it interesting at least 		it sounds like a cop-out, but the real answer is somewhere in between. Dems establishment really is gonna gets its way in many primaries this year, but doesn't mean the Left won't score more victories than usual
of note: The conyers bill outlines the various tax hikes it would use to raise the necessary funds. Which, politically speaking, won't be ideal for November
appears a recount is coming, but Eastman is ahead with 100 percent of the vote counted.		NE02 could also turn into an interesting case study of politics of single-payer in 2018: She backs a full-fledged single-payer system (the old Conyers bill) https://t.co/Ds3DkxajMH https://t.co/92CbJLed2K

@PoliticoScott @dccc whatever you do, don't tell @jackfitzdc
Ohio itself is an interesting state to watch -- Dems have barely tried competing there in House races the last few cycles. But it's a state with a bunch of seats that -- if things break really right for Dems -- could all come into play. Which is a good microcosm of the whole map
@dccc ... have a few seats that could come on line if the election swings further in the Democrats favor
@dccc ... than you think given all the hype the Dem primaries have received this year (most of it justified IMO). Of the bunch, #NC09 and #OH01 will probably get the most attention in the fall -- though Ohio and North Carolina both ...
Interesting to note re: tonight's primaries. With a few exceptions (the two Indiana seats), Democrats don't have any primaries of note on the ballot -- despite more than a dozen seats sitting in the @dccc target list. That's unusual, but maybe a little more common ...

maybe low turnout specials are kinder to Dems than the comparatively higher turnout fall elections will be. GOP will also have incumbents to work with, which will help. ... but also maybe the polls right now aren't quite capturing the Dems' edge
