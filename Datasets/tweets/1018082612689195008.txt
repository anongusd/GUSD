@brianphillips 8) So it is fine for you and others to hate the Pats.  I’m sure I would if I hailed from anywhere east of Danbury CT.  But hate them for the right reasons; because you are sick of them defying logic, rules, parity, age, geography and all else that they continue to flout.
@brianphillips 7) The Pats are the guys who shouldn’t be winning but do anyway, even with less talent.  It’s work ethic.  It’s painful.  It can be ugly.  It is not warm and fuzzy, or wordy or engaging.   It is old school when everyone wants new school.  It is teamwork when everyone wants stars.
@brianphillips 6) The Pats defy who and what the NFL wants to be.  Their offensive line coach is 70.  Their coach is 66.  Their Q is 41.  None of them are going anywhere.  Not supposed to happen.  And yet it does.  What is more underdog then that?
@brianphillips 5) And New England really is an odd place for a pro football dynasty to emerge...This is not football country and yet now the Pats are religion up here.  Pats were AFL upstarts.  No pedigree or history, in region that produces NHL players not NFL players.  But it happened anyway.
@brianphillips 4) And think of Brady.  Yeah, he has supermodel wife.  Yeah his diet and pliability stuff is kind of hard to take...even though it looks like it’s working.  But, he also gets paid about the same as Blake Bortles.  He hasn’t asked for max contract even though deserving it. Team!
@brianphillips 3) The Pats are not glitz and glam.  They are more Friday Night Lights then showtime.  We just ground down the Rams high scoring offense with grit and game planning.  Three points.  We may have ruined the Super Bowl for many but that was not supposed to happen in today’s NFL
@brianphillips 2) The Pats win because so many of them are underdogs.  Gronk, Edelman and Brady were all drafted after the 3rd round.  We take guys other teams discard and make them winners.  Think Malcolm Butler.  Undrafted.  Super Bowl hero.  This year it’s JC Jackson.  Next year who?
@brianphillips 1) Mr. Phillips, I totally understand hatred of the Pats - who doesn’t hate teams that win all the time, but your wider reasoning is woefully disconnected to their reality and the screwed up world that is the NFL.  The Pats really are the anti-NFL....
@WCVB No!  People probably believe in God more when they are high then otherwise....
