@AngelFoxToday71 @Tim_Canova Agreed. However, the one poll that had him tied was commissioned by Republicans and for all we know, was meant to give us a false sense of hope. Canova has national following of supporters around the country but that doesn’t mean he did well in the district.

@Tim_Canova Ok, because this tweet implies that if you lose this time, you will automatically claim it was due to rigging just because there has been rigging in the past, which is a bit of a logical fallacy. Whatever the outcome, I hope Snipes and those responsible are held accountable.
@Tim_Canova I’m not terribly educated on this issue but I saw you retweeted this. I am concerned that this sounds a little Trump-ey in the sense that you only want her arrested if you lose? Will you actually have proof there was rigging? 		P.S. I already voted for you https://t.co/jILrFA6zye

@iElijahManley @ArielSabillon21 It’s upsetting that our politics is reduced to this toxic rhetoric
@iElijahManley @ArielSabillon21 It doesn’t have to be to stand up for their right to exist without fear of being terrorized by bombs
@ArielSabillon21 @iElijahManley CNN and Robert DeNiro sent bombs? This is an issue of freedom of the press and expression. Nobody should say they don’t care when those who voice their opinions are targeted. That is what happens in authoritarian societies.
@iElijahManley Ya but by saying that, you are saying you have better things to care about than people’s lives. The discourse in America is so toxic that we are reaching levels of political violence that shouldn’t be ignored. By writing this off, you’re ignoring a dangerous turn in our politics.
@iElijahManley This is inappropriate to say. Whether you agree with the views of the politicians being targeted, everyone should agree that they don’t deserve to be sent explosives. It’s easy to forget we are all human sometimes.
Also, the myth of the “government-run” health care is so tired. Having public health INSURANCE is not the same as having the government run hospitals, private practices, etc.

This may be an unpopular opinion but I feel like social media culture has gotten to a point where we glorify narcissism and self-absorption in the name of “self-love.”  Selfies are great and all, but must we be on here talking about how much better we look than everyone else?
I’m guilty of it, too, but sometimes, let’s just put the phones down...we as a generation are really on those things too much 📱

All in all, I ask that we South Floridians please commit to not blasting the A/C to frigid temperatures at all times, as it is wasteful and uncomfortable for many. Don't get me wrong, I actually love cold weather, but I like cold fresh air, not the artificial stuff.
to feel constantly cold throughout the day, at school, on the bus, in the car, at home, in the store, the list goes on and on. While many people might say "just put on a sweater," it becomes cumbersome to do so and then have to carry it around when you are in warm spots.
Yet, those who control South Florida's numerous air conditioning systems seem to think we need to blast the A/C the same during these months as we do in the hottest times of the year!!! This makes for someone like me, who is lanky and bony and has little natural shield from cold,
Even though South Florida is considered by many to be hot all year long, there is still a small variation in our temperatures between the winter and summer months. Therefore, between the months of October/November and March/April, the weather is quite pleasant outside...
Thread: this is about one of the many things that bothers me about living in Florida, and something those who have never lived here may not realize. This is intended to be more humorous than anything.
