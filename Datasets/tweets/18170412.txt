This is why I‚Äôm not a part of any teachers union, and while I live in a right to work state, I will never be. The whole damn system is corrupt.
@pipandbaby they are dragons but yes
His proposed teacher pay raise uses money from a one year surplus. There‚Äôs no guarantee it‚Äôll be there next year. If it isn‚Äôt, then hoo boy he‚Äôs in trouble. That‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt care about the early child care money.
JBE is worried that the money for the salary increase for teachers AND early child care funding will force him into more significant tax raises, and he‚Äôs been pushing it with those as it is.
Early child care is way more deserving of those funds, and I say that as a teacher who stands to benefit from the proposal. The teachers unions right now are reminding JBE that he owes them, and the pay raise - and subsequently increased union dues - are how he pays them back.
Good on @LouisianaSupe for recognizing the needs of early child care even when they aren‚Äôt a unionized force donating to a gubernatorial campaign in exchange for the money. https://t.co/LDQSomsXdc

So while the Republicans are pouncing on the pouncing of a pouncing on the pouncing, Slate will put up a piece on The Misogynistic and Racist History of Pouncing Culture. That will be pounced on by none other than Rush Limbaugh, and at that point, we‚Äôre just getting started.
However, that celebrity‚Äôs followers won‚Äôt be pouncing. They‚Äôll be pushing back. The Republicans who get outraged at the celebrity will naturally be pouncing on the condemnation of a column that pounces on the discussion of Republicans pouncing on the pouncing of their pouncing.
Of course, the clip will get put up on Mediaite, with a great column by @CalebHowe. However, it‚Äôs likely to get a clap back from C-list celebrity who thinks this is all about Trump‚Äôs wall.
Stelter‚Äôs panel will nod sadly. A Vox senior reporter will tie this pouncing to white victimhood. A New York Times newsroom sub-editor will will get emotional talking about how her reporters get pounced constantly by sexist Republicans.
After that, of course the Republicans will pounce on Cillizza‚Äôs pouncing of the pouncing of the pouncing. That will lead to a panel on ‚ÄúReliable Sources‚Äù where Brian Stelter will lament the abuse that reporters take from Republicans pouncing willy nilly.
And then, when they pounce on the pouncing of the pouncing, Chris Cillizza will write an analysis discussing the Republicans pouncing on the pouncing of the pouncing.
This is outrageous. Wait until the Republicans see this and then pounce on the Washington Post for declaring they pounce on the pouncing. The pouncing will never end.

Stranger still is this compulsion to push back against the idea that hate crimes are happening. Somehow, certain groups of conservatives seem to think that just saying this is an indictment against them. Acknowledging it isn't an admission of guilt.
To say that "more agencies are reporting these crimes" is somehow an argument against the fact that these incidents are happening more and more is... strange.
Interestingly, the biggest pushback here is about increased reporting as though that means my point is moot. It's not. The newly-reporting agencies are not the major cities that have been reporting these statistics for years.
So, if he committed this hoax on the Chicago police department - A DEPARTMENT THAT IS RIFE WITH SCANDAL AND IS ALSO CONSTANTLY FIGHTING INCREDIBLE CRIME RATES - then Smollett has done a disservice to Chicago's citizens, the black community, and the gay community for starters.
There -has- been a noticeable upward trend, and it started well before Trump. You can argue whether or not he has contributed, but the stats have gotten worse - and this is according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Report.
In 2017, there were 7,175 reported incidents of hate crimes. Of those	-2,013 were anti-black	-938 were anti-Jewish	-679 were anti-gay (male)
In 2016, there were 6,121 reported incidents of hate crimes. Of those	-1,739 were anti-black	-684 were anti-Jewish	-675 were anti-gay (male)
In 2015, there were 5,850 reported incidents of hate crimes. Of those	-1,745 were anti-black	-664 were anti-Jewish	-664 were anti-gay (male)
In 2014, there were 5,479 reported incidents of hate crimes. Of those	-1,621 were anti-black	-609 were anti-Jewish	-599 were anti-gay (male)
Here's why a hoax by Jussie Smollett is terrible:
If the guy charged was involved in some way with human sex trafficking, then he should get maximum punishment, and as Higgins was a law enforcement officer before going to Congress, I feel pretty confident that he'd agree.
And this is either the same trafficking ring that was shut down five years ago around this time OR it is another one, which poses even more problems. Not sure how or why this particular guy got involved with it, but it's a shame he worked for Clay Higgins, who is a great guy.
I used to pass by one of the massage parlors several times a week, and never really thought much of it other than it looked shady. But there are a bunch of these all over this city, and only a portion were shut down.
By the way, the headline underplays this a bit. Dude is under arrest for -pandering-... as in, he ran one of these locations (or worse!). His listed address was the same as one of the women arrested, and there is at least one victim of sex trafficking in all this.

This will absolutely be used to curb gun ownership, and conservatives will cry and scream because they ceded the moral high ground the moment they were cool with this declaration. There is no fighting what will come.
The whole purpose in giving Congress the power of the purse is to keep the executive from funding pet projects using non-legislative means. Using a "national emergency" to build the wall is going to fail in court.
And the thing is, those lawsuits are merited. Congress holds the power of the purse, but has delegated that responsibility away over decades. That's the only way he's able to do this, even though it's very clearly outside the scope of the executive branch's power. https://t.co/lZWVG179Dx

@RyanKEYC I don't disagree. Ownership problems exist just as much as the other problems. I just don't believe in the mentality that being fired means you publicly blast the process and whine instead of just going about your life and finding new work.
By the way, I left full-time journalism because of the crappy pay and went into teaching. So I'm not speaking out of ignorance here. I did what was best for myself and for my family. If you think that staying in journalism is best, good for you! Suck it up during the hard times.
The level of entitlement among digital journalists in particular is astounding.
You aren't vital to American political discourse. You're at best a flash in the pan of American history. Get over the fact that an industry doesn't think you're as vital as you think you are.
If your outlet had the audacity to tell unemployed coal miners to do it, then it should be good enough for you, too. Stop being a little bitch and grow up and get a new job.
The journalism industry is tough. You have to do a lot of work for (often times) nowhere near what the time is worth, unless you manage to make your way up to some legacy outlet spot. If you don't like that jobs come and go in that industry, then, yes you should learn to code.

BREAKING: Mueller Indicts Roger Stone https://t.co/4YDU480Rub https://t.co/2wGB9crCS1
So, good on CNN for getting that scoop. I don't really think there was a leak.
If it was based on unusual grand jury activity, then the reporter who figured it out deserves a raise at the very least. If it was a leak, it would have to come from the local FBI, but I think even they would avoid that.
Do you think that after the BuzzFeed report someone in Mueller's office would really leak to any press right now? Especially on indictments, something that has never leaked from that office.
Someone noticed something yesterday and made a good guess. That's good reporting. There is also the fact that Mueller's team is fairly tight-lipped about this sort of thing.
I un-retweeted an earlier tweet that questioned how CNN came to find out about Roger Stone's arrest. I don't think it was a leak.

@mVespa1 welcome to team whodat, brother
There is a cultural problem in across ALL media. Until they act to address and fix it, these things will continue to happen.
And, yeah, the media in general deserves some blame in this. Why? Because it keeps happening, and it isn‚Äôt just Leopold or BuzzFeed doing it.
I get the arguments in defense of the media (in a different political moment, I would be held under scrutiny for something I wrote that was totally baseless), but we have to stop defending the bad eggs under the umbrella of ‚ÄúWe, The Media.‚Äù

Maybe I‚Äôll flesh this out into a longer column later. I dunno. I feel like the journalism industry needed to change ten years ago and they took the worst possible route.
Don‚Äôt stand by a story that is failing to pass the smell test. Investigate and see where things went wrong. If it stands up, time will prove you right.
We all - left, right, and center - need to slow down and verify. We need to wait a moment and check our facts. And, above all, we need to learn to admit when we mess up.
As @moelane (his retirement being the greatest loss in conservative commentary) loved to point out: If it seems to good to be true, it definitely is.
It‚Äôs definitely the fault of the social media movement, where we are now instinctively sharing all our thoughts as they happen. We believe that people want this immediately sharing of information, and it translates into journalism now too.
We‚Äôve done it at RedState, and we‚Äôve had to retract. BuzzFeed is in trouble now. Reporters all over see something that fits in with their inherent beliefs and say ‚ÄúWe need to get this out there ASAP.‚Äù And look what happens.
Maybe I‚Äôm not making my point well because of a lack of sleep, but let me try again: I‚Äôm not saying political ideology isn‚Äôt involved, but the problem with ALL journalism over the last three years is the idea that we must write about all the things we see and hear.
@chasrmartin it is not
Even more older, more experienced reporters have started to fall into the trap to try and keep up. It results in things like fully retracted CNN stories on Trump allies.
BuzzFeed is not unique in that, though. This is more a young journalist trend as everyone moves to digital media and naturally even legacy companies hire the younger generation who has grown up in social media and has been deeply embedded in social trends.
That‚Äôs not to say ideological leaning doesn‚Äôt influence what they release, by any means. You won‚Äôt see BuzzFeed pushing a Bombshell report like that on, sat, Elizabeth Warren.
I say it‚Äôs less ideological because new media on the right does the same. ‚ÄúWe have this information, and we must post it.‚Äù
I would argue that BuzzFeed‚Äôs major problem is the underlying philosophy on journalism, not their ideological bent. They believe in rabid release of all information as equivalent to transparency.

In other words, only Mueller can set us free. That is too much power for one man to wield, but here we are. https://t.co/y0kpvkm70S
What I do know is this: There is nothing that we can really take at face value until the investigation is done, and nothing short of a full, unredacted release of Mueller's report will satisfy the hunger for truth we're all feeling right now.
And yet, the bigger issue here is the claim itself. It is too big a claim to simply dismiss. If there is any truth to it whatsoever, then it's a major problem for Trump. So, I can't just pan it as "fake news."
At this point, all the warning signs are there:	1. Confirmation Bias	2. Unnamed/Anonymous Sourcing	3. No Documentation	4. Writer With A History Of Making Things Up
Maybe they were referencing different things, but the lack of clarity is troubling at best.
To complement the past, Leopold in one interview appears to contradict his co-author, Anthony Cormier. Cormier told CNN they hadn't seen documents, Leopold says they had.
Here's Leopold's past with the truth. It's a rocky past at best. https://t.co/gntzvDATgu
Next, I am wary of any story with Jason Leopold's name attached. He has a history that, strangely enough, involves federal investigations, unnamed sources, and documentation that isn't provided within the stories he writes.
You even had an executive producer from ABC say none of their folks had heard anything like that, and no other outlet has verified it with their own sources. That's not to say BuzzFeed isn't capable of beating those outlets, but it seems like a major development.
There's two red flags for me. Unnamed sources and Mueller talking to Trump Organization people. The latter is a flag because that in and of itself is a major story that no one else had broken. https://t.co/wP6hVZswsy
The story isn't about what Cohen is claiming. The sources are saying Cohen told Mueller this and it was backed up in Mueller's interviews with folks from the Trump Organization.
BuzzFeed News drops a major story at 10:11 p.m. Thursday night. The story claims that there is evidence Trump told Cohen to lie to Congress. The story bases this claim on information given to them by two unnamed sources.
So, here is where I am on the BuzzFeed story. Bear with me a moment as I try to lay this out as best as I can.
There‚Äôs A Big, Glaring Question In BuzzFeed‚Äôs Trump Report https://t.co/SI49lSDGCv https://t.co/ECzqgjMIOV
@redsteeze Right, but add it to his past with ‚Äúsources‚Äù and ‚Äúdocuments‚Äù and there is a pattern.
This morning, Leopold told MSNBC they had seen the documents. Meanwhile, the other reporter, Anthony Cormier, told CNN they hadn't (h/t @redsteeze for that one). https://t.co/gntzvDATgu
One of the bigger red flags about the BuzzFeed report is one if its authors, Jason Leopold, who has a history with inaccuracy, to say the least. https://t.co/gntzvDATgu

If no other major news outlets report anything like this after talking to their own sources, I am very wary. But, if the report includes this information... well, I guess that's why it's imperative the report is made public, isn't it?
So, I'm sorry, but I can't proclaim that Trump Is Finished because a story like this HAS to have something to substantiate it outside of unnamed sources. I won't take Cohen's word for it, I won't take unnamed sources' words for it.
REPORT: Donald Trump Told Michael Cohen To Lie To Congress https://t.co/tcqwSouU7N https://t.co/J24mEQ7oda
But, if the story is overblown, made-up in any way, or based on bad information, then you have set in motion a major, major news cycle on bad info and your credibility is crushed.
If Trump did what the story 1) says he did 2) says Mueller has proof he did, then I don't see anything short of impeachment proceedings and the biggest cable news drama in history.
BuzzFeed News has good reporters and has done some good work. They aren't perfect and they do have a clear slant, but that doesn't mean everything they do is tainted (I have this opinion of most outlets). However, this is a make-it-or-break-it moment.
I realize I'm kind of all over in this thread, but a lot of people are jumping on in full DENY or ACCEPT mode that they aren't considering the ramifications of the reporting itself.

Oh No! Mitt Romney‚Äôs Op-Ed Just Got The Worst Endorsement Possible https://t.co/dMNhzneScZ https://t.co/s7xsDdwFto
If there is some happy medium between the Romney-type Republicans and the Trump-type Republicans, maybe they can help lead the party into a new era. But, I don't have much faith in that right now.
...to try and re-align it when Trump is over. Whether or not you think the GOP can be saved (I currently don't think it can), the fact is that Romney and others like him think it can be. So, he is lighting the signal fires now.
Consider that Romney has been referred to in media (hence my use of the term in the link above) as an "elder statesman" in the GOP. He is going to be someone who can run for re-election when Trump can't. He sees where the party is going, and he's laying the groundwork now...
It's a signal, all right, but consider that Romney will be up for re-election after a hypothetical second Trump term. There's a longer game afoot here.
Now, you could take Romney's op-ed as virtue signaling, a profile in courage, or whatever. I didn't see it as that. https://t.co/O0QosSLC4o

@presjpolk "We" as in "conservatives," which, granted, only holds slightly more of its original meaning than "Republicans."
Don't celebrate the loss of the Weekly Standard, even if you disagreed with some editorial stances. Mourn the loss.
The Weekly Standard was Trump-critical? GOOD. We need to be critical. We need to hold people accountable. Why is that suddenly a bad thing? Is the water too heavy for you to carry alone?
Trump is not perfect and should not be worshipped as such. But he is, and he is worshipped with the same level of obsession as the people who oppose every damn thing Trump touches because TRUMP!.
Or, rather, the definition changed. "Most conservative" used to refer to conservative ideology. Now, "most conservative" means "most loyal." That is a problem.
We used to pride ourselves as a movement on holding our own accountable. We would fight for the most conservative outcomes. That is slowly dying.
It is incredibly sad to see the Weekly Standard shutting down, and if you're celebrating it, you don't get what this means.

@SonnyBunch It's also important to take into account the incredibly probably true fan theory that each character in the Hundred Acre Wood represents a different mental disorder. There's a reason he identifies with Eeyore so much more in this movie than in any previous story.

It was empty. These tiny children scaled Mount Everest to get an empty box. Why? Because Annie‚Äôs Christmas wish was to be with her friends on Christmas.		Why couldn‚Äôt you do that at home and spare me the emotional grief?!
Annie opens the box. She opens it. A look of dread appears on Leo‚Äôs face.		...WHAT‚ÄôS IN THE FUCKING BOX
Annie, a small child, is racing to the very peak of Mount Everest to get her wish box. This, despite Rocket‚Äôs ability to fly and regularly-used mechanical arms.
How does that even help, Leo
Leo used his wish box to get... a light for his conductor baton. He is now casting some sort of magic that turned the sky into van Gogh‚Äôs ‚ÄúStarry Night.‚Äù
Now Rocket can snow mobile past the candy canes, and closer to Annie‚Äôs wish box. But the sun is going down and they can‚Äôt see her wish box in the dark because Rocket doesn‚Äôt have headlights I guess.
June got ballet boots in her wish box, so she is Super Dancing to Fur Elise on top of the candy canes to knock them back into the ground.
Giant candy canes have now sprouted up to block their path. Mount Everest is fucking wild.
Apparently, the only way to get your ROCKET past the TOY SOLDIERS on MOUNT EVEREST is to drum their beat for them.
And now toy soldiers are blocking the path. Again, on Mount Everest.
Rocket just landed and converted to a snow mobile to RIDE UP MOUNT EVEREST.
Apparently her wish box is on Mount Everest. But despite being in a rocket, the kids are worried they can‚Äôt make it to the top.
omg Rocket just used his wish box to get a new gadget that would help Annie find her lost wish box üò≠
You get caught up in some of these children‚Äôs shows when you‚Äôre watching with your kid. Annie on Little Einsteins didn‚Äôt get a wish box from Santa, and it was so sad.

But John McCain had no dog in the fight anymore. I have never agreed with his politics, but he was being himself. It was something that a united Republican Party might have accounted for, but with no true unity it never happened.
Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell spent the first year of Trump's presidency at legislative odds with him (for better or worse). That took some of Trump's worst impulses off the table, but also made room for a lot of bitterness and division. There was no united message.
Trump is not a unifier. He has yet to really unite anyone. He has a loyal, rabid base, and Congressional Republicans who will die for him. But the Republican Party as a whole is not united behind him, nor will they ever be.
When you campaign for multiple election cycles on repealing the Affordable Care Act and don't deliver, you deserve a loss of faith from your voters. Sure, McCain voted against the last possible chance, but there should have been a plan on Day One following the inauguration.
There are two truths we need to discuss.	1) Republican voters did not turn out in bigger numbers in part because of broken promises regarding the ACA.	2) This wasn't because of McCain. This was because of ineffective Republican leadership from Trump on down.

That's my thoughts for the morning. I do not wish to have any more thoughts today. Please do not make me care more than I already have. I am out of coffee and it will not end well. Thank you.
I don't care how it comes across in the media, or how the talking heads on either side react to it. If both sides show a little give and take, the country itself is better for it.
The Republicans got Trump in part because the GOP would cede too much ground. They would start their negotiations from the middle and move leftward, rather than start on the right and move toward the middle.
The part of me that would like to see the country move in a better direction socially and continue on its current path economically, however, wants there to be some moderation and negotiation. A little give and take. There's a catch, however.
The Internet commentary/troll side of me would love to see the Left go Lefter because the backlash would be sweet. But...
I have several good friends who think that the Democrats' problem is that they haven't and won't go left enough. While the GOP took a big hit in cities and suburbs, you're going to drive the suburbs back the other way if you overcorrect a problem that isn't there.
But, as much as you think Trump and the GOP are unreasonable, unless Nancy Pelosi gets firm control of her caucus, you're not going to see that. You'll only see more division.
Glancing over the data, I stand by what I wrote for @CNNOpinion: People want moderation and they want both sides to work together, rather than talking past each other. https://t.co/c1cPr9dILa
On some level, at least briefly, you have to ask then if Trump is really worth it.
Not to say that Tuesday was a major victory for Republicans, though. Expanding their lead in the Senate was good for them, but they lost some major ground gained during the Obama years.
Nowhere near the 63-seat loss of 2010, even if it hits 40 sets lost. There are several races that couldn't be decided right away. Many are still in dispute. If Trump were being as repudiates as Democrats acted like he should have been, then this would have been a catastrophe.
"But what about the House?!" you may respond.
Republicans: Yeah, we're gonna stand by Trump.	Moderate Voters: Not sure I want to support you, dude.	Democrats: Hold my beer and also Leeroy Jenkins.

Here's hoping that the "veteran" teachers are stellar. I got lucky in being able to work with some stellar folks when I started, but not everyone will have that.
LSU's plan is fine and all, but teachers really need a full year - start to finish - in order to see just what it takes. That means you can't just spend your first semester teaching one day per week. You need to hit the ground running.
The question is this: Do you want to produce teachers who are ready or teacher who are prepared? Teachers who are "ready" for a classroom will be overwhelmed for the day-to-day tasks they have to accomplished. Teachers who are "prepared" will know to expect more and plan for it.
I'm with @LouisianaSupe here. 20% of a semester is simply not enough hands-on experience for new teachers. There is way too much teachers are expected to do now, and pedagogy and theory is not going to prepare candidates well enough on its own. https://t.co/3YQmd81y7B

-Excerpts from ‚ÄúThe Way of the General‚Äù, by Zhuge Liang
‚ÄúEncourage people in productive work, don‚Äôt deprive them of their time. Lighten their taxes, don‚Äôt exhaust their resources. In this way, the country is made wealthy and families secure.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt is said that when officials are severe in everything, no one knows where it will end. If they feed off the people so severely that people are hungry and impoverished, this produces disturbance and rebellion.‚Äù
‚ÄúTherefore, the way to govern a nation is to promote the upright over the crooked; then the nation is secure.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo public servants are to a nation as pillars are to a house: the pillars should not be slender; public servers should not be weak. When pillars are slender the house collapses; when public servants are weak the nation crumbles.‚Äù
‚ÄúLife is aoufht by nurturing the spirit; stability is sought by promoting the wise.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe official policy of making appointments should be to promote the upright and place them over the crooked. Governing a country is like governing the body. The way to govern the body is to nurture the spirit; the way to govern a country is to promote the wise.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe worries not about subordinates not knowing their superiors, but about superiors not knowing their subordinates. He worries not about the lower classes not knowing the upper classes, but about the upper classes not knowing the upper classes.‚Äù
‚ÄúConfusius said that an enlightened ruler does not worry about people not knowing him, he worries about not knowing people. He worries not about outsiders knowing insiders, but about insiders not knowing outsiders.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis is the reason for the classic saying ‚ÄòA sage has no constant mind - the people are the sage‚Äôs mind.‚Äô‚Äù
This when you are alert to what the people in the lower echelons have to say, and take it into consideration, so that your plans include the rank and file, the. All people are your eyes and a multitude of voices helps your ears.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis harmonizes the outside with the inside, and harmonizes the inside with the outside; so the Way of government involves the effort to see and hear much.‚Äù
‚ÄúAn observant and perceptive government is one that looks at subtle phenomena and listens to small voices. When phenomena are small they are not heard; therefore an enlightened leader looks closely at the subtle and listens for the importance of the small voice.‚Äù
