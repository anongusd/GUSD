the only difference i see w trump and bush is that i trust trump less with the nukes and bush got more people killed. otherwise, its largely the same thing. (all bad)
i cant tell u how frustrating it is that only like 10 of us remember this. IT JUST HAPPENED.
actually we saw something precisely like this from 2001-2009. fox news worked hand in glove w the bush white house. they literally had a guy go from hosting a fox show to being bush's press secretary (tony snow) https://t.co/Uep5izhjNa
how many of these dumb stories about larry hogan, an extreme outlier, are we going to get? republicans dont want a candidate other than trump. if they did, it wouldnt be hogan. hogan is a the media's version of a aaron sorkin republican. he's a unicorn. the gop is trump. https://t.co/rH9KjsQR06
@NevilleD35 @Ohmaar1 @CalebHowe how many monopolies have cons supported busting up lately? yeah.
@CalebHowe @NevilleD35 My argument is that most of the people working there are acting for all intents as employees so Uber should have to treat them like it
@NevilleD35 @jmadinez If every time suggests a rule you start humming the Soviet anthem it’s not a straw man
We live in a world where companies just jack up insulin prices for medicine people need to live, just based on a whim not supply and demand, and these same conservatives say it’s communism to merely suggest there be some rules to capitalism.
@NevilleD35 @CalebHowe they have a monopoly on the market, effectively, way beyond lyft. its either uber or nothing. so yeah, they need to be regulated.
@CalebHowe @NevilleD35 yes, uber tried to get cute and have employees without providing the basics a company should provide to its workers. and they should be stopped from doing so.
@jmadinez @NevilleD35 bingo. neville acts like these companies just decided on their own to decide on a basic minimum standard for how to treat human beings. no, the govt had to step in because on their own they mulched up people - including children - wo a care in the world.
@CalebHowe @NevilleD35 theyre both companies and companies should have rules. uber has been shown to repeatedly screw over the guys working for them while the execs make bank, and they find ways to exempt themselves from the regulation taxis face. so yeah, it is all of the same ilk.
@NevilleD35 @CalebHowe its not a straw man. every time someone says "hey lets maybe put some rules in place so companies don't abuse people" you guys scream and howl about communism and socialism. its like they have to be literally raping ppl on tv for cons to say "maybe some rules would be good"
@bradbrosi @NevilleD35 right and you know nothing - obviously - about how businesses left to their own devices often abuse people and our society
@CalebHowe @NevilleD35 maybe we should. maybe we should also legislate many of those scams out of existence when the findings show that most of mary kay's agents are the ones keeping the pyramid afloat.
@NevilleD35 @CalebHowe yes and when theyre the only game in town because conservatives also dont support competition... sorry, but leaving shit up to companies to magically do the best always works out poorly.
conservatives: "next thing liberals will say is that companies would just ALLOW CHILDREN TO WORK IN FACTORIES, unless BIG GOVERNMENT stopped them with REGULATION"		history: well, actually... https://t.co/bkYxmrj5ai
@CalebHowe @NevilleD35 considering theyre mostly losing money and contributing to a scam, yeah, we should def regulate companies like mary kay more
conservatives, not the best history-readers, huh? https://t.co/tYcggmNsBE
@bradbrosi @NevilleD35 apparently you know nothing about who worked in factories at the turn of the last century
@NevilleD35 yes, and companies will benevolently magically do whats good for workers, despite hundreds of years evidence to the contrary. typical conservative bullshit.
he should. if the shoe were on the other foot, like if obama shared a personal lawyer with rachel maddow and used that same lawyer to pay off a mistress while maddow shilled for him on air, trey gowdy would have had maddow in for testimony asap. dems need some killer instinct. https://t.co/2FbMMjSJNC
@NevilleD35 and left to their own devices companies will extract as much as they can out of people without care or concern for their well being or society. its why we have to have rules.
@bradbrosi @NevilleD35 the reason uber doesnt do it today is because we nipped it in the bud decades ago. if conservatives had their dream, those laws would not have come into place.

so while im definitely a pessimist on the legal angles w trump (sorry, just dont see a president being indicted much less going to jail) im much more of an optimist on the political comeuppance. but its not a fait accompli either.
if anything trump has proven that the stuff matters even more. w bush, the gop kept winning in 2002 and 2004. there was a 4 year stretch. the gop started losing races in 2017 and lost big in 2018. the stun from losing was a lot shorter this go-round.
one of the things i learned in bush years: conservatives love to tell you that all the stuff thats dug up on them doesnt matter, because they won, nyah nyah nyah. but in reality it does matter, and despite our mostly useless media, people listen and they vote. and they lose.

im so old they said social security was going broke when i was a kid.
just say the green new deal is going to cost $1 jillion, because that's as honest a projection as anything else the right has said for the last 50 years. also, the last two gop presidents have exploded the deficit. you dont have any credibility on spending. *raspberry* https://t.co/ZipDtZCqMW

this is a big part of why i absolutely loathe the senate. there's no part of our government so in love with "da rules" as the senate and it sucks the life out of people who were once bold and normal-speaking. its why i was glad obama gtfo quickly.
when faced with a political obstacle		gop approach: throw out the rules, come up with new ones so they win		democratic approach: throw your hands up and say "welp, we can't do anything about it"		strong and wrong will always beat weak and right
not getting rid of the filibuster is symptomatic of democratic addiction to norms. i dont think it makes a whit of sense to anyone not knee-deep in politics. wanna do big important stuff? throw out the rule book and come up with new rules. stop being afraid. https://t.co/ejxYv05sRS

if anything things are going to get louder and crazier. the right is not going to go back into a bunker and emerge with a rockefeller republicanism. if all we on the left do is plunge into a self-satisfied orgy of technocratic wonkery theyll eat us alive with a competent trump.
2001-9 were not sunny times. the republican president then was not a good guy. dispensing with trump is not going to extract the disease and the response of being nice and incremental and wonky is not the proportion of response that is needed.
part of it is disturbing to me because with faded memories people are retconning the bush years to be "how things used to be" when it was a never-ending cavalcade of lies, dishonesty, graft, corruption and death. mountains and mountains of death and destruction.
part of this disconnect, i think, is this idea that trump is just an aberration. the groupthink that if we dispense with him things will just "go back to normal." but thats a convenient delusion, i think. there's a new normal, completely aside from trump.
(in case im not being clear enough, that's social security, nasa, the new deal, ww2, and the great society)
crazy ideas when they were first proposed	- a national old age pension system	- going to the moon	- a national jobs program	- fighting a two-front war on multiple oceans	- a national welfare program for the poorest		be bold, not incremental
having been on both sides of this debate in the recent past, i truly believe incrementalism just cannot play any more. big, bold strokes, not small steps. we're post-9/11, post-iraq, post-recession and small ball is just not in the cards. go big or go home.

im sure the green new deal is not perfect. no legislation is. but you know what? markey and aoc put something on the fucking table and its a marker to hold people to. that's more than others have been doing for *years*. try it. its good.
then when you have a majority its about getting shit done, not dragging them to where the mass of opinion is. gop has done this for years. its why when they have majorities they know where theyre going. execution obv matters. but ideologically they know where theyre headed.
and the time to demand that is asap. there's not some magical time where dems have gathered up all the seats and *then* you push them to be progressive. trust me, ive seen that show before. it doesnt work out well. you move them to be as reasonably progressive *now*.
a democratic senator from a blue bastion like california should be hauling her fellow democrats toward the most blue-sky climate legislation there is. i dont care if the dems dont have a majority or if the gop is full of deniers. someone like feinstein should be on board.
re: feinstein, i am so in favor of supporting democrats. but im also very against the idea of waiting until some mythical moment to demand democrats be better. even worse, shes not the democratic senator from idaho or west virginia or something. she's from california.
@apocaloptomisti its feinstein who's alienating, not the other way round
@jdubya65 @jkfecke @byelin No such thing
@jkfecke @Deficit_Hawk @byelin People will perceive this if their response is bad like hers was so yeah she should change it
“Opposes the planet roasting in eternal flame” should be a baseline Democratic position like supporting social security
@jkfecke @byelin Right now she has a shitty position on it and that should change
I’m personally very okay with harassing a Democratic senator to not let the planet burn up
@Deficit_Hawk @jkfecke @byelin It’s better than the current alternative (none)

i'd argue a big part of this is because the leading right-wing media attack group, @theMRC is extremely bad at their job, and conservatives are just following suit. but maybe its something else. either way, they suck at it.
with cons its always "the media is doing this," or "reporters did this." and while im inclined to not believe them anyway, actually citing someone for these supposed bad acts would make it far more credible. but then they'd have to be accountable, for once.

@RobProvince @NevilleD35 you mean comey who aimed right for hillary days before the election while he knew trump was being investigated and said nothing? same guy? yeah.
@RobProvince @NevilleD35 they were consulted on the president obstructing justice because he fired the fbi director who wouldnt say his campaign was innocent. the same campaign that has multiple criminal convictions.
@CheeseForEvery1 @RobProvince @WalterFBiela they dont though. they dont like us and generally ignore us. gop could be on verge of a 40 seat loss and the msm will always fall for stories like "kavanaugh is electrifying the gop base"
@sirRoddick @RobProvince @NevilleD35 time will tell. his team has an awful lot of convictions for some poor innocents.
@CheeseForEvery1 @RobProvince @WalterFBiela they fall for gop narratives. constantly. consistently. the facts do not matter.
@RobProvince @NevilleD35 youre literally claiming the fbi is a hotbed of leftism which j edgar hoover would find hilarious
@CheeseForEvery1 @RobProvince @WalterFBiela yes but im talking about the drumbeat. the narrative that the ny times and ap and wapo dance to.
@RobProvince @NevilleD35 would you like a link to the multiple convictions on team trump? you really want to sell the fbi - which has always leaned right - as suddenly to the left of the dnc? mkay
@CheeseForEvery1 @RobProvince @WalterFBiela silver's analysis gets shouted out 10:1 from the scarboroughs of the world who insist gop always has momentum even as theyre getting their ass beat
@CheeseForEvery1 @RobProvince @WalterFBiela where were those articles? the media immediately latched on to "dems come up short" spin from the right after the election. then they jumped on the "pelosi will probably lose speaker race" spin. they jump for it, every time. and i mean the nytimes/nbc/cbs/ap/cnn

@CheeseForEvery1 @RobProvince @WalterFBiela hahaha! they belittle dems, say we cant win elections when we do, say we didnt win enough seats when we do, they say trump is winning when he isnt. they arent on the team, theyre basically on team mitch all the way.
@sirRoddick @RobProvince @WalterFBiela does that change that bloomberg's senior political correspondent at the time was palling around w trump on his zamboni while he was trashing obama and hillary while groping women? no, it doesnt.
@RobProvince @NevilleD35 the email was a story, a legit one. it wasnt of the same caliber as trump's racism and sexual assault. and again the ny times lied in its paper, days before the election and flat out said he wasnt under fbi investigation. gop got it good.
@RobProvince @WalterFBiela there go the goalposts again, lol
@CheeseForEvery1 @RobProvince @WalterFBiela the corporate press still thinks hes fun and games. they love it. its the left calling him a threat to the republic.
@RobProvince @NevilleD35 its a news story. is it the same news story as a rabid racist who literally invited nazis to cover his rally while the fbi was investigating him - even though the ny times said they weren't? no, i dont.

just fucking tell us - what happened, how it happened, why it happened, what will happen because it happened. leave the creative writing to your hobby time or at least after you've gotten the news out of the way.
it kind of goes with what @deanbaquet said in that documentary about the times and trump: he repeatedly says its a "great story." no, infinity war is a great story. the story of trump and the gop and the politics is lives. millions of lives.
baker has written several, well-received books. god bless him. but i dont see why that kind of writing is being put up in the paper as news or news analysis.
one of the problem here is writers at outlets like the new york times believe they are engaged in creative writing endeavors and not -- telling us what happened, how it happened, and why it happened - you know, the "news."

I personally believe the corrective is the left needs to start giving them way more shit. But liberals are extremely uncomfortable with bashing the press. Hopefully I and others can start changing your minds about it.
There doesn't have to be a complicated conspiracy to explain these things. It's not Russian payoffs or corporate bosses looking over shoulders. The mainstream media understands that they get shit for reporting on GOP but Dems will usually just sit there and take it.
People ask me why the press is doing this. Simple. Because it's easy. Calling Trump on his bullshit gets Republicans and their supporters on your back. Pretending that Kamala Harris getting a rappers name wrong is as bad as ripping families apart is way easier.

@MattGertz they are the new york city of selecting presidents
it's like: buford and martina stood in this corner at the gym and yada yada yada barack obama has the nuclear codes. i mean... really.
as someone who has followed politics my whole adult life. im tired of hearing about iowa's 99 counties and the fair and the absolute asinine way a caucus is conducted and the implications that has in choosing the nominee and the presidency.
a one-day primary is bad but also having iowa and new hampshire get this much power to pick the nominee is also bad. sure, iowa was great for obama but i think he would have eventually won even w/o an iowa bump.
