Just watched the movie trailer of Unplanned and I cried.  As I stated in another post doctors tried coerce my mother into getting a abortion by saying I was going kill her. She also had cancer while pregnant with me. I'm glad  she was pro life back then. Glory Be To God
Wants say thanks to my Mother for choosing life. While my mother had stage 4 cancer, Doctors told her she was going to die if she didn't get a abortion. She 69 and I'm 42. Back then she was willing sacrifice her own life for me to live if it came down to it. #LoveMyMom #Prolife

@tongodeon @TakeThatDarwin @jhwk316 @Alyssa_Milano Because the bible is based on facts not myth the shroud of jesus and his tomb have been found as other artifacts.  Even the Arc of Noah was found.
@SheldonAYS @HarrisonKM @michaelmcarver @DirtySouth1982 @gregolsen88 @antwanstaley @BarackObama @dukebasketball @GoHeels We all know who controlled the banks and housing markets at that time during the recession under Bush.  Aka Democrats
@SheldonAYS @HarrisonKM @michaelmcarver @DirtySouth1982 @gregolsen88 @antwanstaley @BarackObama @dukebasketball @GoHeels That is credible  but like I said the truth hurts
@SheldonAYS @HarrisonKM @michaelmcarver @DirtySouth1982 @gregolsen88 @antwanstaley @BarackObama @dukebasketball @GoHeels Democrats  controlled the banks aka the purse and the housing market  under Bush  all because Bush was President doesn't mean he can control the banks and housing market.  Just like now Democrats control the House  now they control the banks financial system and housing markets
@TrumpDog1 @michaelmcarver @DirtySouth1982 @gregolsen88 @antwanstaley @BarackObama @dukebasketball @GoHeels President Bush went to Congress repeatedly for years warning them that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were going to destroy the economy (17 times in 2008 alone). Democrats continuously ignored him,

@SheldonAYS @HarrisonKM @michaelmcarver @DirtySouth1982 @gregolsen88 @antwanstaley @BarackObama @dukebasketball @GoHeels The Representatives sent the President a letter warning that "an exclusive focus on safety and soundness is likely to come, in practice, at the expense of affordable housing."
@SheldonAYS @HarrisonKM @michaelmcarver @DirtySouth1982 @gregolsen88 @antwanstaley @BarackObama @dukebasketball @GoHeels In 2004 Frank and 75 other House Democrats (including such notables as Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, and Charles Rangel) took exception to George W. Bush's public expression of concern about the risky loans that Fannie Mae and and Freddie Mac were making.

Democrat President Bill Clinton’s mentor was U.S. Senator J. William Fulbright, an Arkansas Democrat and a supporter of racial segregation. Democrat Senator J. William Fulbright voted  against the 1965 Voting Rights  Act.	.
Democrats passed the Repeal Act of 1894 that overturned civil right laws enacted by  Republicans.	Democrats declared that they would rather vote for a “yellow dog” than vote for a Republican, because the Republican Party was known as the party for blacks.
Hillary's mentor Democrat Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia,  is well-known for having been a “Kleagle”  in the Ku Klux Klan. Democrat Senator Robert Byrd of West  Virginia, personally filibustered the Civil  Rights Act of 1964for 14 straight hours to keep it from  passage.

@RevGeraldPalmer @TheOfficerTatum Not mentioned is the fact that it was Republican President Dwight Eisenhower who actually took action to effectively end segregation in the military.
@RevGeraldPalmer @TheOfficerTatum Did Republican President Eisenhower Achieve The Desegregation Of The Military?	A:  Yes. 	Much is made of Democrat President Harry Truman's issuing an Executive Order in 1948 to desegregate the military.

@RevGeraldPalmer @TheOfficerTatum Republicans opposed segregation
@EricHow04464909 @TheOfficerTatum @PamelaGuisto The Voting Rights Act of 1965 abolished literacy tests and other measures devised by Democrats to prevent African-Americans from voting.
@EricHow04464909 @TheOfficerTatum @PamelaGuisto August 4, 1965	Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen overcomes the Democrat attempts to block the 1965 Voting Rights Act.  94% of Senate Republicans voted for that landmark civil right legislation, while 27% of Democrats opposed it.
@EricHow04464909 @TheOfficerTatum @PamelaGuisto .  The Democrat President Lyndon Johnson relied on Senator Everett Dirksen, the Republican leader from Illinois, to get the Act passed.
@EricHow04464909 @TheOfficerTatum @PamelaGuisto The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was introduced and approved by a staggering majority of Republicans in the Senate. The Act was opposed by most southern Democrat senators, several of whom were proud segregationists—one of them being Democrat Senator Al Gore Sr

@EricHow04464909 @TheOfficerTatum @PamelaGuisto June 9, 1964	Republicans condemn the 14-hour filibuster against the 1964 Civil Rights Act by U.S. Senator and former Ku Klux Klansman Robert Byrd (D-WV), who served in the Senate until his death in 2010.
@EricHow04464909 @TheOfficerTatum @PamelaGuisto .May 6, 1960	Republican President Dwight Eisenhower signs the Republicans’ Civil Rights Act of 1960, overcoming a 125-hour, around-the-clock filibuster by 18 Senate Democrats.

@__brandonblanco @MLK_859 @TheOfficerTatum @KamalaHarris Goldwater was a Libertarian, not a racist. 	A review of Senator Barry Goldwater’s record shows that he was a Libertarian, not a racist. Goldwater was a member of the Arizona NAACP and was involved in desegregating the Arizona National Guard.
@__brandonblanco @MLK_859 @TheOfficerTatum @KamalaHarris You have your facts distorted.History reveals that it was Democratic Attorney General, Robert Kennedy that approved the secret wire taps on Dr, Martin Luther King Jr., and it was Democratic President Lyndon Johnson that referred to Dr. King as " that N preacher."

@__brandonblanco @MLK_859 @TheOfficerTatum @KamalaHarris .  He did not mention one word about voting rights.  Information about Johnson’s anemic civil rights policy positions can be found in the “Public Papers of the President, Lyndon B. Johnson,” 1965, vol. 1, p.1-9.
@__brandonblanco @MLK_859 @TheOfficerTatum @KamalaHarris Notably, in his 4,500-word State of the Union Address delivered on January 4, 1965, Johnson mentioned scores of topics for federal action, but only thirty five words were devoted to civil rights.
@__brandonblanco @MLK_859 @TheOfficerTatum @KamalaHarris Was Democrat President Lyndon Johnson A Civil Rights Advocate?		No.		Democrats ignore the pivotal role played by Senator Dirksen in obtaining passage of the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act, while heralding President Johnson as a civil rights advocate for signing the bill.
@__brandonblanco @MLK_859 @TheOfficerTatum @KamalaHarris https://t.co/f5sWFadcNi

@__brandonblanco @MLK_859 @TheOfficerTatum @KamalaHarris Senator Goldwater also supported the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and the Civil Rights Act of 1960, as well as the constitutional amendment banning the poll tax. 	His opposition to the more comprehensive Civil Rights Act of 1964 was based on his libertarian views about government.
@__brandonblanco @MLK_859 @TheOfficerTatum @KamalaHarris Goldwater was a member of the Arizona NAACP and was involved in desegregating the Arizona National Guard.
@__brandonblanco @MLK_859 @TheOfficerTatum @KamalaHarris Was Senator Barry Goldwater A Racist?		A:  No.		Democrats today castigate Republican Senator Barry Goldwater as anti-black.  However a review of Senator Barry Goldwater’s record shows that he was a Libertarian, not a racist.

@__brandonblanco @MLK_859 @TheOfficerTatum @KamalaHarris Senator Thurmond was never in the Ku Klux Klan and, after he became a Republican, Senator Thurmond defended blacks against lynching and the discriminatory poll taxes imposed on blacks by Democrats.
@__brandonblanco @MLK_859 @TheOfficerTatum @KamalaHarris In fact, Democrats declared they would rather vote for a “yellow dog” than a Republican because the Republican Party was—and still is—the party for blacks.
@__brandonblanco @MLK_859 @TheOfficerTatum @KamalaHarris Did The Parties Switch Sides On Racism:  No. 	It does not make common sense to believe that, after Republicans spent over 150 years fighting the Democrats to achieve freedom and equality for blacks and won, they suddenly crossed the isle and switched sides with the Democrats.

@JT_Vintila @JoshGellers @charliekirk11 Congressional records show after signing the 1972 Equal Employment Opportunity Act and issuing Executive Order 11478, Richard Nixon, a Republican, that started what we know as Affirmative Action.
@JT_Vintila @JoshGellers @charliekirk11 Republican President Ronald Reagan, signed into law, a bill to make Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday a national holiday. Several Republican Senators convinced President Reagan this was the right thing to do.
@kmerian @JT_Vintila @JoshGellers @charliekirk11 Senator Byrd referred to Dr. King as a "trouble maker" who causes trouble and then runs like a "coward," when trouble breaks out.
@kmerian @JT_Vintila @JoshGellers @charliekirk11 History reveals that it was Democratic Attorney General, Robert Kennedy that approved the secret wire taps on Dr, Martin Luther King Jr., and it was Democratic President Lyndon Johnson that referred to Dr. King as " that[ insert the racist word ]preacher."
@kmerian @JT_Vintila @JoshGellers @charliekirk11 From the formation of the Democratic Party in 1792 to the Civil Rights movement of 1960's, Congressional records show the Democrat Party passed no specific laws to help Blacks, every law that they introduced into Congress was designed to hurt blacks in 1894 Repeal Act.
@kmerian @JT_Vintila @JoshGellers @charliekirk11 History reveals that every piece of racist legislation that was ever passed and every racist terrorist attack that was ever inflicted on African Americans, was initiated by the members of the Democratic Party.

@ldubya56 @TheOfficerTatum @KamalaHarris Democrats passed the Repeal Act of 1894 that overturned civil right laws enacted by  Republicans.		Democrats declared that they would rather vote for a “yellow dog” than vote for a Republican, because the Republican Party was known as the party for blacks.
@ldubya56 @TheOfficerTatum @KamalaHarris Democrat Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia,  is well-known for having been a “Kleagle”  in the Ku Klux Klan.		Democrat Senator Robert Byrd of West  Virginia, personally filibustered the Civil  Rights Act of 1964for 14 straight hours to keep it from  passage.
@ldubya56 @TheOfficerTatum @KamalaHarris Democrats supported and passed the  Kansas Nebraska Act to expand slavery.		Democrats supported and backed the Dred  Scott Decision.		Democrats opposed educating blacks and  murdered our teachers.		Democrats fought  against anti-lynching laws.
@ldubya56 @TheOfficerTatum @KamalaHarris The  Democrats:		Democrats fought to expand slavery  while Republicans fought to end it.		Democrats passed those  discriminatory Black Codes and Jim Crow laws.		Democrats supported and passed the  Missouri Compromise to protect slavery.

@Ragcha @DiamondandSilk @Alyssa_Milano @BarackObama President Johnson could not have achieved passage of the civil rights legislation without the support of Republicans.
@Ragcha @DiamondandSilk @Alyssa_Milano @BarackObama The chief opponents of the 1964 Civil Rights Act were Democrat Senators Sam Ervin, Albert Gore, Sr. and Robert Byrd who filibustered against the bill for 14 straight hours before the final vote.
@Ragcha @DiamondandSilk @Alyssa_Milano @BarackObama In fact, Dirksen was instrumental to the passage of civil rights legislation in 1957, 1960, 1964, 1965 and 1968.  Dirksen wrote the language for the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Dirksen also crafted the language for the Civil Rights Act of 1968 which prohibited discrimination housing
@Ragcha @DiamondandSilk @Alyssa_Milano @BarackObama Little known by many today is the fact that it was Republican Senator Everett Dirksen from Illinois, not Democrat President Lyndon Johnson, who pushed through the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
@Ragcha @DiamondandSilk @Alyssa_Milano @BarackObama Get your facts straight  LBJ didnt pass the civil rights because he wanted to.  He was forced to pass it by Republicans. Republican Senator Everett Dirksen Championed Civil Rights In the 1960s

@RashidaTlaib There is no language known as Palestinian. There is no distinct Palestinian culture. There has never been a land known as Palestine governed by Palestinians. Palestinians are Arabs, indistinguishable from Jordanians (another recent invention), Syrians, Lebanese, Iraqis,
@RashidaTlaib Palestine has never existed — before or since — as an autonomous entity. It was ruled alternately by Rome, by Islamic and Christian crusaders, by the Ottoman Empire and, briefly, by the British after World War I.
@RashidaTlaib The truth is that Palestine is no more real than Never-Never Land. The first time the name was used was in 70 A.D. when the Romans committed genocide against the Jews, smashed the Temple and declared the land of Israel would be no more.
@RashidaTlaib Palestine is a myth no such thing

@MacFinn44 @italianbitchfit @AMV_LUVS_RJV @ChangeTheLAUSD @thebradfordfile @dawn_dawnrene3 @GOP @SteveKingIA @realDonaldTrump @CoreyStewartVA Can you read half witt LBJ and Kennedy both voted against civil rights you stupid Tard. Republicans fully supported civil rights
@italianbitchfit President Johnson could not have achieved passage of the civil rights legislation without the support of Republicans.
@italianbitchfit chief opponents of the 1964 Civil Rights Act were Democrat Senators Sam Ervin, Albert Gore, Sr. and Robert Byrd who filibustered against the bill for 14 straight hours before the final vote.
@italianbitchfit fact, Dirksen was instrumental to the passage of civil rights legislation in 1957, 1960, 1964, 1965 and 1968.  Dirksen wrote the language for the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Dirksen also crafted the language for the Civil Rights Act of 1968 which prohibited discrimination in housing.
@italianbitchfit Come on we all know LBJ was a racist bastard that's all the proof
@italianbitchfit Republican Senator Everett Dirksen Championed Civil Rights In the 1960s	￼		Little known by many today is the fact that it was Republican Senator Everett Dirksen from Illinois, not Democrat President Lyndon Johnson, who pushed through the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
@italianbitchfit  https://t.co/DgUJ4BFGdn
@italianbitchfit We’ve got to give them a little something. Just enough to quiet them down, but not enough to make a difference. If we don’t move at all, their allies will line up against us. And there’ll be no way to stop them.  It’ll be Reconstruction all over again.”
@italianbitchfit ￼		Behind closed doors, President Johnson said: “These Negroes, they’re getting uppity these days. That’s a problem for us, since they got something now they never had before.  The political pull to back up their upityness.

@italianbitchfit @AMV_LUVS_RJV @ChangeTheLAUSD @MacFinn44 @thebradfordfile @dawn_dawnrene3 @GOP @SteveKingIA @realDonaldTrump @CoreyStewartVA President Kennedy, through his brother Attorney General Robert Kennedy, had Dr. King wiretapped and investigated by the FBI on suspicion of being a Communist in order to undermine Dr. King.
@italianbitchfit @AMV_LUVS_RJV @ChangeTheLAUSD @MacFinn44 @thebradfordfile @dawn_dawnrene3 @GOP @SteveKingIA @realDonaldTrump @CoreyStewartVA President John F. Kennedy voted against the 1957 Civil rights Act while he was a senator, as did Democrat Senator Al Gore, Sr. After he became president, Kennedy opposed to the 1963 March on Washington by Dr. King that was organized by A. Phillip Randolph, a black Republican.
