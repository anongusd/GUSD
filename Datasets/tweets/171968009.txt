“Lack of candor.” That’s one of the reasons AG Sessions used to justify his decision to fire former FBI Dep. Dir. Andrew McCabe. Ironic bc as you may recall, Jeff Sessions has demonstrated a lack of candor—under oath—about his own interactions w/ Russians. https://t.co/lMiJJoCLOZ

Senator Franken will be making an announcement tomorrow. More details to come.
Today I asked the nominee for Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at @usedgov if he would guarantee equal access to education for all students. https://t.co/uWJY7CYq3l
It’s unfortunate that the Trump administration scrapped guidelines to protect transgender students under #TitleIX, but rescinding the guidance didn’t change the law, and it didn’t take away students’ rights.
#LGBT students deserve to learn in an environment free from discrimination, and they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.
The first big snowstorm of the season blew across the state and hit northwestern Minnesota particularly hard, where areas got up to 11 inches of snow. Bundle up, stay warm, and please make sure to stay safe if you’re driving. https://t.co/a8ChMvDE62
@FCC At a minimum, this vote should be delayed until there’s a review into how bots influenced the #NetNeutrality debate. I pressed Chairman Pai to do that earlier today. https://t.co/pyDKX0XC4W
.@FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has decided to go full speed ahead with a December 14 vote on a policy that would destroy #NetNeutrality —&amp; he’s doing that despite an alarming report that computer bots may have influenced the public comment period on this terrible policy.
Since the internet was created, net neutrality has been the reason why giant corporations can’t pick, choose, block, or charge you extra for the websites you visit. But all of that—the fundamentals of the internet as we know it—is at serious risk.
I believe that preserving net neutrality—the principle that the internet is a level-playing field for ideas, business, and innovation—is among the most important issues facing this generation.
#Dreamers are members of our families, they are our friends, they are our neighbors, and they should be here to stay.
I promise that I will keep fighting to protect the Dreamers who live in Minnesota and across the country by defending DACA and fighting to pass the #DREAMAct, a bill with bipartisan support that would create a pathway to citizenship for #DACA recipients.
Dreamers care deeply about this country, work hard, and are doing all they can to build a good life in America. Minnesota is home to more than 6,000 Dreamers.
#DACA protects individuals who were brought to the United States as children and grew up here. Often called #Dreamers, they're American in every single way except for their immigration status.
@NASEM_Health My legislation helps ensure that drug companies increase transparency, affordability, access, and innovation. We need this bill to become law so that these companies put patients before profits and bring much-needed relief to families and seniors.
I’m glad to see @NASEM_Health’s report ‘Making Medicines Affordable’ identify a number of the same priorities I’ve included in my comprehensive legislation to lower prescription drug prices. https://t.co/kBcQqpJ2xX
Many Americans are stretched thin by skyrocketing prescription drug prices—and for many, it’s forcing them to make difficult choices. No one should have to skip meals or turn off their heat in order to afford medications, but right now, that’s exactly what’s happening.
Make sure you have health insurance next year. And know that I’ll be working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to expand coverage, lower costs, and improve care so that all Americans can access affordable, high-quality health care.
Minnesotans can get free help selecting and enrolling in a plan by visiting https://t.co/ObOmS6BDFh or calling 1-855-366-7873.

@NatlParkService I’m deeply concerned by @POTUS &amp; @SecretaryZinke’s interest in drastically reducing the size of two national monuments—Bears Ears &amp; Grand Staircase-Escalante.

We should be working to better the lives of middle-class families in Minnesota and across the nation, not deepen the pockets of the wealthiest few.
Republicans have decided that it’s better to overwhelmingly benefit large corporations and the wealthiest Americans, who will see huge tax cuts, rather than the middle class.
I support smart, commonsense tax reform that would make the tax code simpler and fairer for Minnesota families. But that’s not the GOP tax plan that passed in the Senate in the middle of the night.
After a lot of reflecting with my family over the Thanksgiving holiday, I was glad to continue my work in the Senate this week doing the job the people of Minnesota sent me here to do. More here: https://t.co/QAoGDJ5FRJ

At end of fiscal year '16, oil &amp; gas companies were producing on less than 2% of the 1 million+ acres of federal land they have under lease in AK.

Minnesota cabin owners—and all home, business and farm owners in cabin country—would be hit particularly hard by the Republican tax plan. And that’s bad for Minnesota. I urge you to give this piece in @StribOpinion a read to learn more. https://t.co/groLIbVuhU
Beyond that, cabin ownership is incredibly important to the health of our rural economies and to small businesses that rely on tourism and outdoors enthusiasts.
In Minnesota, heading up to a cabin on the weekend isn’t just another thing to do—it’s a way of life. Cabins mean a great deal to Minnesota families. They hold lots of memories, are often passed down through generations, and many folks save up their whole lives to buy one.
We need to make sure all Minnesotans—including those in tribal communities—have access to reliable, affordable broadband.

RED ALERT: Senate GOP just added provision to their tax plan that would gut ACA &amp; kick 13M ppl off insurance. Yes, it's same tax plan that would add $1 trillion+ to deficit while giving majority of benefits to corporations &amp; the rich. We need you to make your voices heard again.
@BetsyDeVosED If you want to learn more about this disturbing trend, I urge you to check out this report from my colleagues @SenWarren and @SenatorDurbin. It’s an important read that will help shine a light on a serious problem. https://t.co/HPqFCDLMac
As a member of Senate Education Committee, I find this inaction by the Trump Administration and its Education Department Secretary @BetsyDevosED very troubling. The U.S. government shouldn’t side w/ unscrupulous schools over our students, but that’s what’s happening right now.
That means they are students and graduates all around the country who were swindled by for-profit colleges and can’t get relief from their student loan payments.
Here’s a staggering statistic: since July, the number of Americans who claim they’ve been defrauded by their school has jumped by more than 20,000. But guess how many of those borrower defense claims have been approved by the Trump Administration? That’s right: zero of them.
Under the Trump Administration, for-profit predatory colleges—like many that you constantly see ads for on TV—have been able to get even more of a foothold in our higher education system. And that’s because they have no fear of accountability or repercussion.
This cruel, inhuman treatment amounts to torture. I believe that one of the primary authors of the Bush Admin's torture program—one of the darkest periods of our history—doesn’t deserve another opportunity to make decisions on behalf of our country. https://t.co/VtqAFPn7WL
Bradbury authored several memos that authorized the use of “enhanced interrogation techniques” during admin of President George W. Bush. One of Bradbury's memos approved the use of waterboarding, cramped confinement, slapping, stress positions, and dietary manipulation.
I strongly oppose allowing Steven Bradbury to serve as general counsel for the Trump Administration’s Department of Transportation, and yesterday in the Senate, I voted against moving his nomination forward.
#ICYMI: Republicans want you to believe that if we give a bunch of tax breaks to Wall Street billionaires and corporations, they’ll raise wages &amp; bring jobs back from overseas. @SenWarren and I sat down to tell you what will really happen. https://t.co/ZdUnvjFVws

I’m going to fight this harmful tax plan and keep pushing for a more fair and simple tax code that truly benefits families in Minnesota and across the nation.
The vast majority of the benefits would go to the wealthiest Americans and large corporations in the form of tax cuts, while working families would see little meaningful help.
The Republican tax plan would be bad news for Minnesota, plain and simple. Last week, Minnesota small business owners and I voiced concerns about this misguided plan. https://t.co/czo43Yu3zJ

In talking to these and other Minnesota veterans, I'm always struck by the profound sacrifices that they—and often their families—have made to defend our nation and its freedoms.
I recently had an opportunity to meet #veterans from Minnesota as they arrived in Washington on an "Honor Flight." These flights allow men &amp; women who have served in WWII, Korea, &amp; Vietnam to travel to the nation's capital to visit memorials dedicated to their service. https://t.co/Rqu1pZeKgn

.@POTUS has formally declared the #opioid epidemic is a National Public Health Emergency, and now we needresources to actually address it.
Every American needs to know that Pres. Trump can’t stop you &amp; your family from signing up for health coverage. Keep it up &amp; get enrolled!
And tell your friends, family members, colleagues, old pals, &amp; acquaintances to do the same.
So if you don’t get insurance through your employer or through Medicare, check out one of these websites as soon as you have the chance.
Second, January 14. That’s the final day of open enrollment for Minnesotans, who can sign up for insurance on https://t.co/o2DehpZRB8.

Now go grab a pen or pencil (or more likely, open up an app on your phone) because here are a couple of big dates to remember.
On Nov. 1, the first day of #openenrollment, 200K+ Americans chose an insurance plan. That’s 2x as many as last year’s kickoff.

I recently helped introduce a bill to make new investments in opoid prevention, treatment, recovery &amp; monitoring. https://t.co/nke6PFQRvt
The opioid epidemic has wrought havoc on every corner of our country, including Minnesota, and it demands a serious response.
With my grandson Joe a few days ago in DC (he’s going as Catboy from PJ Masks). Happy #Halloween to those braving the cold weather in MN! https://t.co/N88vGmQm7k

Granting China market economy status would threaten trade checks on China &amp; make it hard to crack down on them when they dump steel into US.
But when China props up its own companies, it undercuts American producers and threatens our workers, communities, and industries.
When it comes to producing iron ore &amp; steel, MN's Iron Rangers can compete with anybody in the world when they’re on a level-playing field.
@IndianCommittee I’m going to keep working hard to get MN communities (including tribes) the resources they need to get this epidemic under control.
@IndianCommittee Last week I helped intro a bill to make new investments in opioid prevention, treatment, recovery, &amp; monitoring. https://t.co/nke6PFQRvt
@IndianCommittee That's why I pressed federal health officials to engage with tribal communities and help address this growing epidemic. https://t.co/VLOcBZ2fU6
As a member of @IndianCommittee, I know that tribal communities have been hit by the opioid crisis. https://t.co/BXGOahvcYy
@ChuckGrassley Our bill will help ensure that farmers, some of the hardest-working folks, can repay debts they owe w/o sacrificing their families’ futures.
@ChuckGrassley This bipartisan bill is the product of two Midwest farm state Senators working together in a bipartisan way to support our family farmers.
Glad Congress passed my bipartisan bill w/ @ChuckGrassley to give farmers in MN &amp; across country fairer shake when they fall on hard times. https://t.co/l1ld9lFO8s
Check out our joint op-ed calling on Congress to pass bipartisan Alexander-Murray bill to improve the ACA. https://t.co/7EGRP0NApq
It’s time for parties to set politics aside &amp; work together to lower the cost &amp; improve quality of health care for every American family.
Bipartisan problem-solving may seem unlikely but fmr. MN GOP Sen. Durenberger and I know it’s possible bc we’ve seen it happen firsthand.
Congress must work in open &amp; bipartisan way on real solutions to improve health care for families in MN &amp; across the U.S.
@SholomLife .@RachelSB, when you're right, you're right. Meet Dottie, who joined me during my visit with the wonderful Helen Nemer today. https://t.co/Yfk8ssIKLI

No matter where I go in Minnesota, I always meet Minnesotans I’m proud to represent.
I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together to pass this legislation for our kids. https://t.co/qoHCHjEgT1
We must fund these programs. If we don’t, it will have devastating impacts on our safety net providers and communities across Minnesota.
Yesterday I took to the Senate floor to demand action on the Children’s Health Insurance Program &amp; 2 other vital safety net programs.
I believe that every child in this country should have access to affordable, quality health care. Period.
Tomorrow is National Prescription Drug Takeback Day. Find out where you can safely discard Rx meds. https://t.co/1gSDDmRWR1

Afterschool programs help keep kids safe and engaged in activities before their parents/guardians come home from work. #LightsOnAfterSchool
As co-chair of the bipartisan Senate Afterschool Caucus, I know that afterschool activities help kids develop into well-rounded students.
I’m going to work hard to get this bill passed because this crisis is destroying Minnesota communities, and it demands a serious response.

I'm pleased to share that Congress passed my bipartisan bill w/ @ChuckGrassley to help family farmers when they fall on hard times. https://t.co/YqamwSMnP1
A bad year for farming shouldn’t mean that Minnesotans have to lose their family farms forever.
@POTUS I'm going to continue to fight for Minnesota families because this executive order is not who we are as Americans.
@POTUS This order has the power to block innocent people from uniting with their family members already in the US. https://t.co/Un8BRKSVJM
America should stand as a beacon of hope, yet @POTUS’ latest executive order on refugees is more of the same: discriminatory &amp; unacceptable.
@POTUS That’s why I’m urging @BetsyDevosED along w/ 8 @HELPCmteDems to enforce civil rights laws. This dramatic rise in harassment is an outrage. https://t.co/Fnnjl9gEfC
@POTUS Schools have a responsibility to ensure that all students have equal access to education in a safe and supportive environment.
I'm concerned @POTUS tweets &amp; remarks are normalizing bigotry, racism, homophobia, &amp; misogyny in schools &amp; threatening safety of students.
It’s deeply troubling that incidents of harassment &amp; intimidation have increased in K-12 schools, colleges, universities, since the election

Tonight, some of my @SenateGOP colleagues, @VP sent clear message that they think Wall Street &gt; Americans. I'll keep fighting for consumers.
@CFPB I'm taking to the Senate floor to stand up for @CFPB rule b/c it’s my job to work for MN—not Wall Street. https://t.co/gRKBioumcb

I believe that all Americans should have the right to pursue justice in a public court of law and challenge widespread corporate wrongdoing.
@USGAO Ignoring scientific consensus will put children &amp; grandchildren at risk, weaken our economy, &amp; undermine America’s world leadership.
@USGAO We need to tackle #climatechange bc the stakes are too high—&amp; consequences are too devastating—to leave this problem to future generations.
.@USGAO reports #climatechange could cost the United States trillions of dollars by the end of the century. https://t.co/CHI2S9gUNw

@ChuckGrassley &amp; I have 3 bipartisan bills to help students and families better understand their college costs. https://t.co/COwRvlkUek
1 reason is b/c students often lack clear idea of how much college actually costs &amp; don't fully understand which schools they can afford.
The skyrocketing cost of college &amp; burden of debt that grads enter real world w/ is problem for students, families, &amp; our entire economy.

They're upset, &amp; justifiably so, that Congress can’t get enough done. But that’s why I became Senator: to cut thru gridlock &amp; improve lives.
When I travel around MN to talk with people about what really matters to them—I hear a lot of frustration with Washington.
As we rebuild, it must be in a resilient &amp; sustainable way to prevent this crisis from repeating itself when another hurricane hits.
No American should have to wait this long for action. We need an immediate, wide-ranging effort to speed up the rebuilding process.
In Puerto Rico, a month after Maria hit, more than 80 percent of the island is still without power. That’s unacceptable.
While the camera crews have mostly left and national attention has died down a bit, millions are still fighting to recover.
I’ve been thinking a lot about all the Americans—in TX, FL, US Virgin Islands, &amp; Puerto Rico—who are digging out after this yr's hurricanes.

I strongly opposed @POTUS' previous two travel bans bc they were poorly thought out, poorly executed, and above all, would hurt Minnesotans.

@CommerceGov I was glad to keep this fight going today with two of my Minnesota Congressional colleagues, @amyklobuchar and @USRepRickNolan.
That’s what I told the @CommerceGov in June when I first backed an investigation into the threat of foreign steel to our national security.

I'm asking @FAFNorwalk to make companies publicly disclose income, assets, and taxes paid, among other things, on country by country basis. https://t.co/Ks1yCnIbGl

It’s alarming that some large American companies are able to take advantage of tax havens to dodge U.S. tax rules.
I believe the public has the right to know what countries large companies pay (or don’t pay) taxes in.

@POTUS @USCBO Your stories made the difference in defeating the latest Trumpcare bill and now I’m asking you to again join me, and make your voices heard.
@POTUS @USCBO We should be working in bipartisan way to ↑ coverage, ↓ costs, &amp; improve care—which is exactly what we are doing in Senate Health Committee.
@POTUS This will drive ↑ costs for ppl on the exchanges. Non-partisan @USCBO estimates premiums will ↑ 20% &amp; number of uninsured will ↑ 1 million.
@POTUS And @POTUS move to scrap #CSRs, which are payments that help low- &amp; middle-income families pay for their health care, is unacceptable.
@POTUS On top of that, @POTUS wants to open the market to junk insurance plans, which could drive up costs for folks in the individual market.
@POTUS President Trump’s exec order could mean that families—in MN and nationwide—lose access to affordable, comprehensive health coverage.
@POTUS But @POTUS has ignored the message sent by Americans of every political stripe in every corner of the country by signing latest exec order.
@POTUS Millions of Americans made their voices heard when Senate Republicans tried to destroy the ACA. And those GOP plans thankfully failed.
We should be working to fix the ACA, build on the law’s successes, and address the costs of health care. @POTUS doesn’t seem to agree.
President Trump’s new executive order could undermine our nation’s health care system &amp; drive up costs for millions: https://t.co/TMoVQiFKDv

I'm troubled by @EPAScottPruitt's decision to repeal Clean Air Plan, which will cut efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

Access to birth control affects decisions women make every day—like whether to start a new job or how much a family can save for college.
But today, the Trump Administration announced it will give employers the power to deny women birth control coverage.
It’s 2017. It shouldn’t be up for debate that women deserve to make their own health care decisions for themselves and families.
After eight years in office, I can finally get a good night's sleep. I'm sure that won't last long. Any paper would be lucky to have you. https://t.co/gSmFu9TXIM

Congratulations to the 2017 @WNBA champs @minnesotalynx. 4 titles in 7 years! You make Minnesota proud.

Good luck to the @minnesotalynx as they play in the final game of the #WNBA championship series tonight against LA. Hoping for a 4th title!
#Dreamers are an integral part of the fabric &amp; future of our country. We must protect #DACA and pass the DREAM Act. https://t.co/Ah7tvmQn9Q
It’s playoff game day! I’ll be cheering on the @Twins as they take on the Yankees in their first #MLB playoff game in seven years.
It’s always a privilege to thank those who’ve sacrificed so much for our country. https://t.co/AS5kPo1kYF
I recently greeted Minnesotan veterans participating in an Honor Flight to D.C. to visit memorials dedicated to their service.
Yesterday, my staff attended a community mental health task force meeting in Virginia to discuss mental health services on the Iron Range. https://t.co/j8yX2ziuPp
Like my friend, the late Senator Paul Wellstone, I believe that all Americans should have access to the mental health services they need.

We owe it to the victims of the Las Vegas attack and their families to address gun violence. My full statement: https://t.co/OZVVixBXwE
A tragedy occurred in #LasVegas last night. My heart is with the families who lost loved ones and those who were injured in horrific attack.
Thanks to all the Minnesotans working to help fellow Americans affected by Hurricane Maria. https://t.co/GINGzOssGI
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC So tomorrow, I hope colleagues will keep in mind that @FCC chair should be someone who upholds principles of internet, listens to Americans.
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC We need to make sure all Americans—including those in rural, tribal, low income communities—have access to reliable &amp; affordable broadband.
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC .@AjitPaiFCC, while mobile technology may one day support the same functions as fixed #broadband services, that is not the case today.
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC You see, @AjitPaiFCC has also signaled potential changes that could deem mobile only service sufficient for communities across the nation.
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC And what's more, if @AjitPaiFCC is approved for another term, he could conclude that Americans' broadband needs are being met.
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC RED ALERT: Destroying the internet as we know it shouldn't be a top priority for head of @FCC. But tomorrow's vote could keep him in place.
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC But in addition to having their voices heard, I want someone in charge of @FCC who believes best interest of Americans &gt; special interests.
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC Millions of people in MN &amp; across our nation have weighed in on destructive @FCC proposal to destroy #netneutrality, &amp; I hope they're heard.
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC I've fought @AjitPaiFCC's proposal bc consumers, small biz, &amp; all people deserve an open internet. And millions of you have bought back too.
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC Allowing giant corporations to pick and choose content available to everyday Americans would threaten the basic principles of our democracy.
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC Let me be very clear: getting rid of #netneutrality would destroy the internet as we know it.
@FCC Earlier this year, under President Trump, new head of FCC @AjitPaiFCC announced proposal to gut #netneutrality protections.
@FCC In the time since, @FCC rules have faced constant attacks by mega-corporations that want to squeeze more $$$ out of biz and their customers.
More than 2 yrs ago, after outpouring of grassroots support from Americans, @FCC put rules in place to permanently protect #netneutrality.
#Netneutrality allows a small business in Minnesota to compete with the big guys, it drives innovation, and it protects free speech.
#Netneutrality means what you read, see, or watch on the internet isn't favored, blocked, slowed down based on where content is coming from.
For as long as the internet has existed, it’s been grounded on the principle of #netneutrality.
ALERT → Tmrw Senate vote could mean an end for #netneutrality rules, the principle that the internet should be free &amp; open.
Now, more than ever, it’s important to fight for the interests of working Minnesotans by protecting our public sector unions.
Powerful interests behind #Janus are using #SCOTUS to further tilt the playing field against working people.
In upcoming #Janus v. AFSCME case, Supreme Court could weaken the power of unions.
Thank you, @MNNationalGuard members, for providing relief to areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. https://t.co/JZKVollUQp
In northern Minnesota this weekend? Be sure to check out the foliage, which will be in peak color. 		https://t.co/FiVfHtSI0h
We need to pass this bill, and we also need to continue looking at other ways to reduce student debt &amp; increase college affordability.
It’s great to hear students believe this bill will make college more affordable. That’s exactly why I introduced it. https://t.co/VEBnOGHAJB
I just reintroduced my Affordable College Textbook Act, which will expand the use of open textbooks that students can get for free online.
One of the most overlooked &amp; fastest rising expenses for students is textbooks, which have jumped in cost by over 80% in the last decade.
Folks discussed how the VA can improve the Choice Program to ensure veterans have access to high quality health care in their communities. https://t.co/LMqGpsrnhU
I’m glad my staff was able to attend a VA community meeting on health care &amp; benefits in Hibbing yesterday.
One of my top priorities as Senator is to make sure that our veterans and their families get the services they have earned.
Congratulations to 8 Minnesota schools on being recognized as National Blue Ribbon Schools for their academic excellence by @usedgov. https://t.co/TkPcydiDDo
Applications are due on Friday, October 27. I look forward to helping our future leaders seek admission to these prestigious academies.
My office is accepting applications from young Minnesotans interested in attending one of our U.S. Service Academies https://t.co/5kxxeZf531
I was proud to introduce this bill to improve our clean energy infrastructure, create jobs, &amp; cut energy costs for families &amp; businesses. https://t.co/gHmyj3gfP2
@AjitPaiFCC @FCC I’ll continue to fight to protect our country’s First Amendment by pressing the #FCC to preserve #netneutrality.
@AjitPaiFCC @FCC The millions of Americans who weighed in with the FCC on this destructive proposal know that, and I hope @AjitPaiFCC listens to their calls.
@AjitPaiFCC @FCC Mr. Pai, I have a message for you: without #netneutrality, the internet as we know it wouldn’t exist.
@AjitPaiFCC @FCC The Senate is expected to vote on another term for Pai on Monday, and if reapproved, he could lead to the destruction of an #openinternet.
But I’m deeply concerned that a proposal from @AjitPaiFCC, @FCC chair under President Trump, will reverse rules that protect #netneutrality.
We must protect #netneutrality, the long-standing principle that the internet is a free, open and level-playing field for all Americans.
@USDA @SecretarySonny MN dairy farmers can get through this crisis. I’m continuing my fight to give them the tools they need to do so. https://t.co/9biK7AfiN1
@USDA In a joint effort, we’re calling on @SecretarySonny to make milk eligible for the Federal Crop Insurance program.
That’s why I’m pressing @USDA with a bipartisan group of my Minnesota Congressional colleagues to provide critical support to dairy farmers.
Like many Minnesota farmers, our dairy producers have been hit hard by low prices, resulting in sharply reduced incomes.
1 in 5 jobs in Minnesota are tied to agriculture, and dairy producers play an important role in our state's economy.
Welcome back, @SteveScalise. Franni and I wish you the best as you continue on your path to full recovery.
@Twins Big congrats to our @Twins on making the postseason—first team in history to make playoffs a season after losing 100 games.
We’re gonna win, @Twins, we’re gonna score! Playoff baseball and Minnesota back together again. #MNTwins
Today I met w/ the MN Head Start Association &amp; I told them that I’ll keep fighting to fund high-quality early learning programs. https://t.co/B3es0uPzoZ
The achievement gap b/t disadvantaged students &amp; their peers starts before kindergarten, but early childhood programs help narrow the gap.
I believe that investing in high-quality early childhood education is one of the smartest investments we can make.
Glad my staff attended the Promoting Peace Conference in #Waseca today, where experts discussed how to strengthen healthy communities in MN. https://t.co/eW9jFXcOMQ
@miwsac @IndianCommittee We must do everything we can to end the unacceptable tragedy of human trafficking in Minnesota and across our country.
@miwsac @IndianCommittee During my time in the senate, ensuring that MN's Tribal Communities have a strong voice in Washington has been a top priority of mine.
Today, Nicole Matthews of @miwsac and White Earth Nation testified in @IndianCommittee about human trafficking of Native Americans. https://t.co/SCq1nsWd0f
@CFPB We can’t let them get away with this. And so today, I stood up for @CFPB rule, because my job is to work for Minnesotans—not big banks. https://t.co/2c50qaXDOK
Wall Street wants to scrap @CFPB’s #forcedarbitration rule, which protects Americans’ rights when they sign up for things like credit cards.
My job is to work for Minnesotans—not Wall Street. That’s why I’m fighting efforts to scrap @CFPB rule. Watch live: https://t.co/P2fH4utjbY
My statement on the Senate Republican decision to abandon #Trumpcare vote: https://t.co/yK1eyBztsf
I'm proud that $20 million grant will allow @MnDeptEd to invest in the future of	our young people and scale up literacy education efforts.
It’s never too early to expose students to programs that will enhance their quality of life and give them the tools to succeed.
@SenatorDurbin @SenAngusKing I’ll continue to fight for real, problem-solving measures to increase higher education accessibility, affordability, and graduation rates.
Today, @SenatorDurbin, @SenAngusKing, &amp; I intro'd Affordable College Textbook Act, which will expand availability of open college textbooks.
Expanding access to free online textbooks is a commonsense solution that will bring down college costs for students across America.
That's what college students from across MN have told me time and time again. And I believe it's time to keep more $$ in students' pockets.
Students in MN and our nation are working longer and longer hours during the school year and still have to take on massive amounts of debt.
Congress &amp; the White House must act swiftly &amp; assertively to bring relief to Puerto Rico. This is our job as federal lawmakers &amp; Americans.
Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico’s infrastructure &amp; leveled entire communities. 3.3 million Americans are facing humanitarian crisis.
@amyklobuchar And I’m proud to work w/ @amyklobuchar on defeating #GrahamCassidy, which undermines care and protections for MN families, kids, &amp; seniors.
Congrats @amyklobuchar on the debate last night – once again you showed Minnesotans how fortunate we are to have you representing our state.
Glad to see @MinnStateEdu waive application fees in October. I’m working to increase college access, affordability &amp; graduation rates. https://t.co/H08YnwbzAc
CBO on #GrahamCassidy: “The # of ppl w/ comprehensive health insurance that covers high-cost medical events would be reduced by millions.”
Another reason why #GrahamCassidy shouldn't become law:
158 Minnesota organizations oppose #GrahamCassidy, saying it ends promise of Medicaid for Americans when they need it the most. https://t.co/cDerTKQ0da
I plan to fight this travel ban &amp; stand up for all Minnesotans, including our immigrant &amp; refugee communities. https://t.co/DMMiEf3hDV
Today, I happened to have a meeting w/ the Somali Prime Minister and had the chance to discuss President Trump’s new travel ban with him. https://t.co/47WW19O6hx
Glad @Target is investing in their workers by raising wages. We need to expand economic opportunity &amp; build an economy that works for all. https://t.co/Uh4gujbgjM
@MinnesotaDHS Learn more about #GrahamCassidy’s harmful impact on Minnesotans and state budget by checking out @MinnesotaDHS’s fact sheet: https://t.co/XHAnepPmik
.@MinnesotaDHS finds that w/ latest #Trumpcare bill, MN would lose $1.9B in federal funding in first 3 yrs, &amp; $37B by 2030. #GrahamCassidy https://t.co/kB2pmkKe3K
Glad to see that @StarTrib Editorial Board is also calling for increased protections of Americans’ personal data. https://t.co/BQh5RJl8k0
This month, I introduced a bill to help protect consumers whose personal data has been leaked by the Equifax hack.
Equifax’s data breach highlights the need for transparency &amp; accountability from companies that trade on our privacy.
I believe Americans have a fundamental right to privacy, including the right to greater control over how companies buy &amp; sell personal info.
Good luck @minnesotalynx in the #WNBAFinals this Sunday. 6th time in last 7 seasons! Here’s hoping for a 4th League Championship.
.@BetsyDeVosED's decision to reverse guidelines on campus sexual assault threatens students’ civil rights. We must protect our students.
#GrahamCassidy would be disaster for MN. Fed funding cuts would make it harder for ppl to afford coverage, force many to go w/o health care. https://t.co/TOxpBFg2d8
@FCC I’m pressing @FCC to let the public review &amp; comment on evidence affecting the #netneutrality proceeding, because this impacts all of us. https://t.co/CTB6B5TDZk
@FCC I believe in free &amp; open internet. What we read, see &amp; watch shouldn’t be favored, blocked or slowed down based on where content comes from.
I am deeply troubled by @FCC’s interest in eliminating rules that protect #netneutrality, which would destroy the internet as we know it.
I always meet Minnesotans I’m proud to represent no matter where I go in MN. More on August visits in @austinherald: https://t.co/diBqbwQ9nl
In August, I traveled throughout MN to hear from Minnesotans because it’s my job to make sure their voices are heard in Washington.

@navigatemn I’m encouraged by recent bipartisan developments and will continue to fight tirelessly to pass the Dream Act.
@navigatemn #Dreamers are members of our families, they are our friends, they are our neighbors, and they are here to stay.
Tmrw, I’ll be at @navigatemn's legal clinic in Shakopee, which will offer resources for DACA renewals &amp; additional immigration services.
Minnesota has 6,000+ #Dreamers, hard working folks who came to America as children and who contribute to our economy and our culture.
President Trump’s decision to end #DACA is a disgrace to our moral values and principles. It's not who we are or should be as a nation.
Glad my staff is at the #MidwestEnergyStorage Summit to learn about trends, opportunities and barriers in our region. https://t.co/eW6IDKj1Xp
We need to invest in technologies like energy storage &amp; renewable energy to bring our country’s energy systems into the 21st century.

@SenateDems I’ll continue to work on measures that promote affordable, high-quality child care for the people of Minnesota – and across the nation.
@SenateDems It was an honor to meet Jessica Honza from MN, who bravely spoke about her family’s difficulty with affording skyrocketing child care costs. https://t.co/q2WiEgWE3S
Today I helped introduce the Child Care for Working Families Act w/ @SenateDems to create better child care options for working families.
The cost of child care has increased by 25% in the past decade, forcing parents to choose between going to work and paying for child care.
I believe that we need to create a child care system that is affordable, high-quality, and works for low income &amp; middle class Americans.
And today I met with Tom McLaughlin, state chair of the @VFWHQ's MN chapter, to discuss legislative health care priorities for veterans. https://t.co/VKtYboUH9R
In August, I championed a bipartisan measure to ensure that Minnesota National Guard &amp; Reserve members get full access to GI benefits.
I believe that our veterans and their families – who have sacrificed so much for our country – must get the benefits they were promised.
@Lawrence @TheLastWord In the meantime, I hope you'll read what former Vice President and MN Sen. Walter Mondale penned for @StarTribune: https://t.co/4JTFTuxmnm

I’m saddened by former Senator Pete Domenici’s passing. His leadership on mental health parity w/ Paul Wellstone will have a lasting legacy.
@NFUDC I’m proud to be a strong advocate for MN agriculture. I’ll continue to fight for measures that support our farmers.
@NFUDC This legislation would help farmers and ranchers invest in renewable energy and fuels, cut energy costs and support rural jobs.
@NFUDC Supporting MN agriculture is one of my top priorities. Just last week, I introduced a blueprint for the energy section of the new #FarmBill.
Thank you @NFUDC for recognizing my commitment to Minnesota’s farmers, ranchers, and rural communities w/ the Golden Triangle Award.
With one in five jobs in Minnesota tied to agriculture, I know that farming is the backbone of our state's economy.

@Vikings And when we dropped by last month, I was—as usual—excited for this year's squad. https://t.co/A0Z98Dw0AD
Each summer, my son Joe and I head to Mankato to check out @Vikings training camp and chat with the players and coaches.
Today, @SenCortezMasto &amp; I led broad coalition of 20 @SenateDems in pressing Equifax's CEO to completely end its use of #forcedarbitration. https://t.co/IFoo8wVxwf
Today is also a reminder of our capacity to put aside differences, stand together, and overcome any threat that faces our great nation.
We remember those who lost their lives in NY, the Pentagon, and PA 16 years ago—and heroism of those who responded to #September11 attacks.
I send my deepest sympathies to fallen officer William Mathews' loved ones and @WayzataPoliceMN.
As a member of @SenateEnergyDems, I’ll continue to champion legislation that promotes the expansion of Minnesota’s #cleanenergy economy.
#Cleanenergy now employs 57,000+ Minnesotans. Between ’15 &amp; ’16, the industry grew at an extremely fast rate.
Minnesota is a leader in #cleanenergy, which drives economic growth throughout our state and protects the planet.
Thank you Eliot Seide for your leadership at @afscmemn5 and for all you have done for working families in Minnesota.
When MN communities can access high-speed internet, students do better, businesses grow, health care improves, and families stay connected.
I’m glad to see this new investment. Deploying high-speed broadband to more rural and tribal areas of Minnesota is a huge priority of mine.
Congrats to Fond du Lac Band on its #FiberToTheHome initiative, an investment to provide 900+ homes with broadband.

I'm glad to see @mnhealth effort (made possible by @CDCgov) to combat #opioidcrisis through data. More info here: https://t.co/zKxlVVk4c4
I’m committed to addressing the opioid crisis across our nation because we owe it to people like Sharon from Minnesota to tackle this issue.
Recently, I met w/ group in Olmsted County. Sharon was among attendees &amp; bravely shared story of losing her daughter Rachael to opioid use.
Across MN, I've met w/ officials, health care and community service providers, and law enforcement learning about effects of opioid crisis.
I strongly urge all who are in path of the storm to closely follow latest alerts and to take care of your families. https://t.co/yqeGmfLnx0
We also owe a big thanks to the workers, officials, and volunteers who are preparing to keep Americans safe if Irma hits the mainland.
Thank you to all of the emergency responders who are already working tirelessly to help folks affected by #HurricaneIrma.
My measure will support rural jobs, play critical role in cutting energy costs, and help farmers and producers invest in #energy efficiency.
I’ve offered blueprint for energy section of new #FarmBill bc I want to stand up for farmers, producers, and rural biz in MN and our nation.
As we craft 2018 Farm Bill in Congress, I’m fighting to make sure MN's ag priorities are being heard—&amp; that’s why I intro'd my energy bill.
In Minnesota, one-in-five jobs is tied to agriculture, which means that the economic health of our entire state depends on farming.
Each and every day, our nation’s farmers have our backs. I believe we need to have	theirs as well.

@FCC While I have these concerns, glad @FCC heeded my call to give Americans more time to make their voices heard abt high-speed internet needs.
I have concerns abt @FCC considering whether mobile broadband service—at lower speeds—could replace faster fixed broadband services now.
All Americans—including those in rural, tribal, and low income communities—should be able to access reliable and affordable broadband.

@FCC I'm urging @FCC @AjitPaiFCC, along with fellow @SenateDems, to allow time for Americans to make their voices heard. https://t.co/GjSUW6hWxe https://t.co/jrbDFca4bE
@FCC By redefining what it means to have access, @FCC could abandon further efforts to connect ppl living on tribal lands &amp; in rural communities.
@FCC If slower mobile broadband speeds are deemed sufficient, @FCC could conclude Americans' broadband needs are being met. That's not the case.
@FCC .@FCC, a small business owner who wants to begin a new venture today would not be adequately supported by mobile only #broadband service.
But @FCC is considering whether mobile broadband service at lower speeds could supplant, rather than supplement, fixed #broadband services.
We need to make sure all Americans—including those in rural, tribal, &amp; low income communities—have access to reliable/affordable #broadband.
Today, I'm joining a group of Minnesotans to discuss the importance of preserving #NetNeutrality for MN businesses and consumers.
Thanks to Stillwater Mayor Ted Kozlowski, Washington County officials, local biz owners for joining me on tour of St. Croix River Crossing.
After working to make St. Croix River Crossing possible for a long time, it was great to tour the new bridge connecting MN and WI yesterday. https://t.co/hcdRN7OJwI
Sat down to chat with ten internat'l journalists about our political system and freedom of the press. Oh, they're enjoying @mnstatefair too. https://t.co/s4NvmCWfgK
I'm wearing purple today—International Overdose Awareness Day— bc we need to bring attention to, and work to combat, the opioid crisis. https://t.co/6VESrTEdwH
I also met Sharon who lost her daughter Rachael to an opioid overdose, and who	bravely shared her story w/ all of us gathered in Rochester.
Last week, I sat down with Olmsted County officials, health care &amp; community service providers, &amp; law enforcement to discuss opioid crisis.
RT @WinonaDailyNews: At Winona Health, Franken sees a model for rural health care https://t.co/jW5utgbzwj https://t.co/N42tayZiRK
@aarpmn @winonahealth @winonastateu These are the kinds of programs that truly make a difference, and I'm proud of efforts in Minnesota that are helping to support our seniors.
@aarpmn @winonahealth @winonastateu Chelsea from @winonastateu meets with Jean regularly, and Jean told me at @winonahealth that it’s nice to have Chelsea looking out for her. https://t.co/JmqCH2sxH4
@aarpmn At my recent @winonahealth visit, I learned abt partnerships &amp; a program that connects seniors w/ student health coaches from @winonastateu.
@aarpmn I heard from Minnesotans like Carolyn of Plymouth. Carolyn highlighted the importance of preventing our seniors from feeling isolated.
Thanks to the thousands of Minnesotans who joined my call with @aarpmn last night to talk about how we can improve health care for everyone.
@BetsyDeVosED @POTUS And as a @HELPCmteDems member, and a Senator from MN—where we’ve seen for-profit fraud firsthand—I’m very disturbed by what’s happening.
@BetsyDeVosED These are clear messages to fraudulent for-profits that they have nothing to worry	about while @POTUS is in office.
@BetsyDeVosED But already, the Trump Admin has unraveled two safeguards that protect students from for-profit fraud. And now this. https://t.co/3JQKHMMrpd
@BetsyDeVosED That’s like putting the fox in the henhouse. Now I believe fraud should be punished, not rewarded—I don’t think that’s a controversial view.
Outrageously, the Trump Admin and @BetsyDeVosED have just appointed a former DeVry dean to the office that investigates higher ed fraud.
As a result, DeVry paid $100 million to settle those claims and provide financial	restitution to defrauded students.
DeVry University, a fraudulent for-profit college, swindled tens of thousands of students by misleading them about job and salary prospects.
I joined the millions of Americans who've voiced support in protecting #NetNeutrality, &amp; today is the last day to submit a comment to @FCC.
We can't destroy the internet as we know it. We must uphold #NetNeutrality protections.
Paid prioritization would enable ISPs to amplify the voices of those w/ the deepest pockets, while quieting—if not silencing—everyone else.
Without #NetNeutrality rules, multibillion-dollar companies could control where their users get their info and could choose to bury sites.
Allowing giant corporations to pick and choose content available to everyday Americans would threaten the basic principles of our democracy.
Happy to be here, @aarpmn. About to join call with thousands of Minnesotans to talk about working to improve health care for all Americans. https://t.co/tDROY0jLNF

President Trump isn't just pardoning Joe Arpaio for being a supporter. He's pardoning him bc he doesn't believe Arpaio did anything wrong. https://t.co/18sHqhCpW6

Thank you to all of the emergency responders, firefighters, and rescue workers who are keeping Americans safe in TX during #HurricaneHarvey.
Presidential pardons should not be rewards for bad behavior and discrimination. Granting a pardon to Joe Arpaio is shameful and appalling.
President Trump, transgender Americans bravely serving in the military aren't a burden or a disruption. They are heroes. #ProtectTransTroops

@mnstatefair I want to know what Minnesotans love most about the fair. Hope you’ll send me a photo of your favorite part of the Great MN Get-Together.
Each year, my favorite part abt @mnstatefair is getting the chance to talk to people from across the state about the issues they care about.
@MNNationalGuard Pleased bipartisan #veterans bill was signed into law, and pleased to help secure this win for many Minnesotans. https://t.co/SnRQDOUrJU
That’s why I helped write &amp; intro bipartisan vets legislation. My provision gives @MNNationalGuard &amp; Reservists GI benefits they've earned.
We need to support the men &amp; women who serve our country, &amp; who put their lives on the line to defend our freedom, when they come back home.
My thoughts are w/ those who lost loved ones, &amp; those whose family members were injured, in Barcelona terror attack. https://t.co/wZjgYspi8X

@POTUS Glad my staff could attend #DACA event in Minnesota today bc the important program is emblematic of what our country stands for. #DACAWorks https://t.co/AjwqsSdSMP
@POTUS Earlier this year, @POTUS signaled that he would keep #DACA in place, and I want to hold him to his word.
I’m opposed to a recent effort by other states to cancel #DACA, and just last month, I pressed @POTUS to preserve the program. #DACAWorks
I understand how important #DACA is—these young people are American in every way except for their immigration status. #DACAWorks
These kids, teenagers, young adults have gone to school, &amp; many have earned college degrees &amp; started contributing to society &amp; the economy.
Because of #DACA, there are hundreds of thousands of people in our country who’ve spent last 5 years free from the fear of being deported.
This is not acceptable behavior for any American. This is especially appalling coming from the President of the United States.
When someone shows you who they are, you believe them. Trump is again letting white supremacists off the hook for #Charlottesville violence.

But one thing hasn’t changed. Ag remains critically important to MN’s economy &amp; its way of life. Read my op-ed here: https://t.co/34l5p8GT7a
Our country has a new Agriculture Secretary and a new direction on a lot of policies that affect our farmers, ranchers, &amp; rural communities.
Glad to see a new @USFWS proposal would build on that by expanding fishing and hunting opportunities at MN Valley National Wildlife Refuge.
With 10k+ lakes and lots of wildlife and land, Minnesota is among best spots in the country for hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation.
MN added enough new wind energy last yr to power about 150k homes, &amp; wind industry now employs 4,000 workers in our state. #AmericanWindWeek
I want upcoming #FarmBill to promote farmers markets, like the @StPaulMarket I visited yesterday. https://t.co/2hGu6I8zIU #FarmersMarketWeek https://t.co/jzrwNnNzSB
@SenateDems I recently sat down with Senator @ChrisVanHollen to talk about my bill to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. https://t.co/4TRDKQdv0A
It’s time for action. That’s why I’ve helped intro plan w/ @SenateDems, which includes effort to tackle Rx drug prices I’ve long championed.
It’s morally wrong that some people are denied access to lifesaving prescription drugs because they can’t afford them.
No American should ever have to choose between affording their medication and putting food on the table for their family.
Farmers markets support healthy communities and increase access to fresh food. Taking part in #FarmersMarketWeek in South Saint Paul today. https://t.co/P58MJPp1Jn
@POTUS And here’s an important @StribOpinion read that confirms a lot of what I heard at my meeting: https://t.co/XfAun5ntjD
The @POTUS immigration plan is bad for Minnesota—that's what I heard over and over at a meeting I held yesterday in St. Paul.
@BldgTrdsUnions Thanks so much. I intro'd Advancing Career Pathways Innovation Act bc I want to scale up efforts to address #skillsgap across the nation.

@POTUS I’m standing up against @POTUS' overly-aggressive immigration tactics bc these families make many contributions to our country and economy. https://t.co/e1gmaIbyWh
And I heard concerns today from Minnesota Latino organizations about @POTUS’ aggressive immigration policies. https://t.co/jEt3E2Btrg
The Trump Administration’s restrictive immigration efforts are causing fear and anxiety for Minnesota children and their families.
I've called for action to prevent entry of Asian carp into Great Lakes. Glad @USACEHQ released plan. https://t.co/PU3LluF9nt
The invasive carp have been traveling up the Mississippi. Experts fear that if they reach Great Lakes, they'll devastate ecology, fisheries.
Asian carp are an invasive species that endanger Great Lakes—incl. our own Lake Superior. We need a plan in place to address this threat.
#ICYMI, I'm urging Trump Admin with Sen. @RonWyden and fellow @SenateDems to protect seniors in MN and our nation. https://t.co/zBeIC0uPDi
Congratulations to @MayoClinic for being named best hospital in the country by @usnews, and #1 in state rankings in AZ, FL, and MN.
I’m leading an effort w/ @RonWyden &amp; 29 of our colleagues to urge Trump Admin @CMSGov to abandon reckless proposal. https://t.co/XLGvr0AVvy https://t.co/e6YMszeuhK
@POTUS I’m going to continue fighting for these kids, families because this executive order is not who we are as Americans. https://t.co/2Y5dPSX2wB
But now, @POTUS' mean-spirited exec order banning refugees is blocking orphaned refugee children from uniting with American foster families.
And abt 30 yrs ago, our country est. program to connect refugee children w/o a parent or guardian to care for them with US foster families.
The United States has been a beacon of hope for immigrants and refugees from around the world for centuries.

RT @MNTRiO: Agreed.  Education and Freedom depend on neutrality, not those that pay the most! #TRIOworks https://t.co/s5WpndPZzb
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC .@FCC should follow its own precedent. Extend #NetNeutrality reply comment period to ensure all voices are heard in the historic rulemaking.
@FCC In 2014, during previous #NetNeutrality proceeding, @FCC provided 60 days for ppl to reply. Now @AjitPaiFCC wants to cut that time in half.
.@FCC has received 16+ million comments on proposal to undo strong #netneutrality protections. It's clear ppl are making their voices heard.
#NetNeutrality is key to driving innovation in MN and across the country. And we need to do all we can to protect a free and open internet.

I wrote a provision into the #veterans bill that will give @MNNationalGuard and Reservists the education benefits they’ve rightfully earned.
That’s why I helped write and intro bipartisan package of #veterans legislation that's set to become law after passing the Senate yesterday.
The men &amp; women who serve our country put their lives on the line to defend our freedom, &amp; we should support them when they come back home.

@CMSGov I’m going to fight back against this misguided decision bc MN seniors and families deserve better, and I hope you'll make your voices heard.
@CMSGov But now the Trump Admin's @CMSGov is planning to lift the ban on nursing home arbitration clauses, which would be terrible for Americans.
When @CMSGov heeded my call &amp; outlawed #ForcedArbitration clauses in long-term care facilities contracts, it was a victory for Minnesotans.
These pre-dispute #forcedarbitration clauses are something I’ve been fighting to rein in for a long time bc I'm proud to fight for families.
Many long-term care contracts have fine print preventing residents and families who were wronged from seeking justice in the courts.
Admitting yourself or a loved one to a nursing home is one of the most difficult life decisions. It shouldn’t be harder than it already is.
Glad to see that so many Minnesotans are gathered at new bridge over St. Croix. Proud to have supported legislation that made this possible. https://t.co/9F9uolxuCY

And tomorrow, let's get started on working across the aisle to improve health care for all Americans.
Tonight was a win. We should all be proud. But the fight is not over. Thank you for making your voices heard. Now get some rest.
Keep fighting back against this bill. Families in Minnesota and across our country deserve better than this. The fight is just beginning.
No matter what happens, thank you to the hundreds of people who came out to the Capitol &amp; those across the nation making your voices heard. https://t.co/NYLUS3Pxvq
(50) the number of Republican Senators who will own this travesty of a bill if it passes.
(7) the number of years that Republicans spent undercutting the #ACA while doing nothing to write their own viable health bill.
(2) the number of hours since the GOP released a mangled health plan that would crumble our health system &amp; leave 16 million more uninsured.
Let's break down some numbers behind this so-called Republican #SkinnyPlan.
There's a lot going on in Washington right now. I'll be joining @maddow tonight to talk about the latest news, including health care.

@CFPB Special interest-backed GOP efforts to dismantle @CFPB rule are underway, which means we must ratchet up the fight. https://t.co/T2B6ITBumw
@CFPB Yesterday, House of Representatives voted in favor of a so-called “resolution of disapproval” to dismantle @CFPB #forcedarbitration rule.
@CFPB But now, giant financial institutions and the big banks on Wall Street are wielding their influence in an attempt to kill the @CFPB rule.
That’s why I support @CFPB rule to help ensure ppl don't have to sign away rights when they sign up for a credit card or a checking account.
For as long as I've been in the Senate, I've been fighting to end #forcedarbitration and reopen the courtroom doors for American consumers.
#Forcedarbitration strips Americans of their rights and forces them into a privatized justice system built to favor powerful corporations.
Housing for Homeless Students Act would help students focus on education bc they wouldn't have to worry about where they'd sleep at night.
My bill would close loophole that prevents many full-time college students—incl. veterans—from qualifying for affordable rental housing.
But current law doesn't allow LIHTC tenants, incl. homeless and formerly homeless ppl, to be full-time students. I'm working to fix that.
The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit has been used successfully to build homes for people who've experienced homelessness.
That's why I've worked to protect and improve tax incentives for housing, including the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC).
It’s National Housing Week of Action, and we should be making affordable housing more accessible for everyone. #OurHomesOurVoices

@USCBO Let’s work together. Let's do all we can to make sure that people have access to affordable, high-quality health care when they need it.
@USCBO It doesn’t have to be this way. Our constituents sent us here to improve their lives. So, I urge my Republican colleagues to vote no.
@USCBO Or will it be something else entirely? We don’t know. This is reckless and irresponsible. Minnesotans and all Americans deserve better.
@USCBO Or will GOP rally behind their backup option—a plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with nothing. Let me repeat: nothing.
@USCBO Do they support "Cruz Amendment," which would bring back junk insurance plans that offer no protection and drive up out-of-pocket costs?
Does GOP support the Better Care Reconciliation Act, which according to nonpartisan @USCBO would cause 22M more people to become uninsured?
With ↓ 24 hrs to expected health care vote—we don’t even know which version of repeal GOP hopes to pass. WATCH → https://t.co/qGQ2C1CJze

@CFPB The @cfpb rule limiting #forcedarbitration reopens courtroom doors for people in MN &amp; across the country who’ve been wronged by Wall Street.

@USCBO (3/4) Half of Americans would live in areas w/o any insurer in market for individual policies by 2020. Yes, you read that right.
@USCBO (2/4) @USCBO report projects that 32 million people across the country would lose coverage over next decade after repeal w/o replacement.
(1/4) The Republican "repeal only" bill is unacceptable. Today's nonpartisan @USCBO confirms that.

@SenateGOP More than ever, it’s so important for all of you to keep speaking out. Keep telling your stories bc your voices matter. #AmericaSpeaksOut
@SenateGOP This revised Senate Republican health care plan, like the last one, is unacceptable. And we can’t afford to let it pass.
@SenateGOP These are plans that don’t provide real coverage, which could make premium costs go way up for millions who have pre-existing conditions.
@SenateGOP Of course, my GOP colleagues tried to make a few changes. Most notably, they now want to allow insurance companies to sell you junk plans.
@SenateGOP GOP health care plan still does not address concerns of general public and makes things worse for more people.
@SenateGOP GOP health care plan would still put rural hospitals and nursing home facilities at-risk of closure.
@SenateGOP GOP health care plan would still dismantle #Medicaid as we know it.
@SenateGOP GOP health care plan would still drive up costs for seniors.
@SenateGOP GOP health care plan would still undermine critical protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

@POTUS I'm relieved to hear that Steve Simon, Minnesota's Secretary of State, has already announced that we won't play ball w/ this absurd request.
@POTUS That's beyond alarming. President Donald Trump's commission furthers a baseless conspiracy theory about voter fraud.
@POTUS .@POTUS is perpetuating false claim that millions voted illegally. And to do that, he wants his admin to have access to your voter history.
Instead of getting to bottom of Russia interfering in 2016 election—an actual threat to our democracy—@POTUS is perpetuating false claims.

@ThisIsMedicaid @SenateGOP Your stories matter. Keep sharing them and making your voice heard. The Senate is listening. #AmericaSpeaksOut
@ThisIsMedicaid @SenateGOP I strongly urge my Republican colleagues to talk and listen to their constituents about how they would be hurt by their #HealthcareBill. https://t.co/izmXzET9YM
@ThisIsMedicaid The decisions that we make as senators literally mean life or death for many Americans. @SenateGOP, this is serious. https://t.co/Nw4SSZ802w
@ThisIsMedicaid I also shared a story from Deborah of MN. She was able to re-learn basic tasks—walking, talking, eating—through #Medicaid after an accident. https://t.co/nTUO7z1uFv

@lisamurkowski I'll keep fighting for Minnesotans like Brandon &amp; Sheri, and I held up their photo so @SenateGOP can see real people their bill would hurt. https://t.co/BHEaa4iev6
@lisamurkowski But if GOP keeps working to gut #Medicaid and weaken coverage for those with preexisting conditions, I'll fight on behalf of Minnesotans.
@lisamurkowski With delayed health care vote, hope this means more GOP colleagues are willing to do something I've long been calling for: working together.
As @lisamurkowski said today, "this is not for Rs to fix or Ds to fix, this is for us as Americans to fix." Healthcare should be bipartisan.
Yes, I agree. And I truly hope Democrats and Republicans can come together and work to improve ACA. https://t.co/H1Eym5QXtz
Pleased that GOP colleagues @SenatorCollins &amp; @lisamurkowski have voiced that they want to work in a bipartisan way to improve health care.
I believe we need to work in open, bipartisan way to build on what’s working in the ACA &amp; fix what isn’t. Americans deserve nothing less.
Gaelynn, thanks for your courage. Thanks to Minnesotans like @GaelynnLea, &amp; all Americans, who are speaking out abt importance of #Medicaid. https://t.co/uzgkCJCWfa
Minnesotans shared concerns abt GOP health care bill w/ me in MN. Keep telling your stories with #AmericaSpeaksOut. https://t.co/0GbmcQ8OMa
@POTUS I’m hopeful that when #SCOTUS hears the travel ban case this fall, they will see it for what it is: discriminatory and unconstitutional.
@POTUS We should always work to improve and tighten security processes, but this isn't the right way. This is not who we are as a nation.
@POTUS Make no mistake, we need to keep fighting this entire discriminatory ban because it does nothing to make us safer &amp; goes against our values.
@POTUS I’m disappointed that refugees fleeing terror and war—the most vetted group of immigrants—could be barred from finding safety in the US.
While #SCOTUS leaves much of travel ban blocked, I’m troubled that some parts of @POTUS discriminatory order will go into effect.
@LynnBlewett @ThisIsMedicaid @patrickmness I'm fighting against the GOP #HealthcareBill because Minnesotans deserve better. All Americans deserve better than cruel Republican plan.

@SenateGOP We should address lack of competition in insurance exchanges, Rx drug costs. We should improve people’s lives, not make them more difficult.
@SenateGOP I believe we need to be directing our efforts to working in bipartisan way to address actual problems that exist in our health care system.
@SenateGOP I will fight the Republican #HealthcareBill with every ounce of strength that I have, because the livelihoods of Minnesotans are at stake.
@SenateGOP .@SenateGOP wants to pull one over on American people by forcing vote on bill ASAP—w/o meaningful debate, public input, committee oversight.
@SenateGOP Like its sibling in the House of Representatives, Senate #HealthcareBill is horrible plan born of dangerously partisan bill-making process. https://t.co/xmctDFTeFe
@SenateGOP GOP plan would fundamentally destroy #Medicaid as we know it, &amp; make life harder and more expensive for millions and millions of Americans.
@SenateGOP GOP health care plan is nothing more than thinly disguised attempt to gift billions of $$$ in tax breaks to the very richest few Americans.
@SenateGOP GOP bill does not address real health care issues people are facing. Would be a disaster for economic stability &amp; livelihood of MN families.
After weeks spent in secret behind-closed-doors, @SenateGOP finally released health care plan. And now that it's seen the light of day?
@MedicaidGov Your voice matters. Keep sharing stories about what the Republican health care bill would mean for you &amp; your loved ones. #AmericaSpeaksOut
@MedicaidGov Mower County would be hit hard. 9,615 Mower County Minnesotans would be at risk of losing health coverage. My op-ed: https://t.co/kud2lvLMDo
@MedicaidGov Under GOP plan, MN stands to lose $2.5 billion in #Medicaid funding in 1st 18 months alone. Losses would ↑ to $5 billion/yr over coming yrs.
@MedicaidGov #Medicaid covers more than 1/2 of all nursing home residents, 1/2 of all births, &amp; is primary source of coverage for people w/ disabilities.
Proposed #Medicaid cuts offer a clear example. GOP bill would cut $834 billion from @MedicaidGov to fund tax break for wealthiest Americans.
Minnesotans understand that the GOP health care bill will harm the well-being of millions of people in our state and across the country.

@SenBobCorker @SenateGOP If GOP truly believes in their bill, they should start making their case to Americans in an open &amp; transparent way. https://t.co/nJTi51n7dK
@SenBobCorker He’s right. It’s time for @SenateGOP to stop hiding their bill bc people across our nation deserve lawmakers who are open &amp; honest w/ them.
GOP @SenBobCorker said “process is better if you do it in public, and that people get buy-in along the way and understand what’s going on.”
Americans deserve to know what’s in GOP health care bill being crafted behind closed doors &amp; what it will mean for them and their families.
That's no way to pass legislation in a democracy, let alone one that could rip insurance from 23M Americans and alter our national economy.
Senate GOP has decided to take the opposite approach, shrouding their health care bill in secrecy, trying to rush bill through w/o hearings.
When we wrote #ACA yrs ago, we had 100s of hours of public hearings, adopted 160+ GOP amendments, &amp; then had hours of debate on Senate flr.

@FCC @AjitPaiFCC A free and open internet is vital to our democracy in the 21st century. Now more than ever, the need to preserve #netneutrality is clear.
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC It's time to fight back because the internet belongs to all of us, not a handful of deep-pocketed ISPs seeking to undermine #netneutrality.
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC Fortunately, consumers &amp; biz will once again have opportunity to make their voices heard. I hope Americans will remain willing to speak up.
@FCC That’s why I am so concerned about @FCC @AjitPaiFCC's proposal to gut the strong #netneutrality rules that we fought so hard for.
@FCC See, #netneutrality isn’t some new idea. Internet innovation &amp; growth didn’t just happen while we had net neutrality. It happened bc of it.
@FCC Businesses small and large pushed to keep playing field level for all, free from discrimination by companies like Comcast, Verizon, &amp; AT&amp;T.
@FCC Consumers urged @FCC to protect their access to a free and open internet. Businesses asked that the internet remain an open marketplace.
@FCC The vast majority of the nearly 4 million comments were from Americans who urged the @FCC to enact strong rules protecting #netneutrality.
@FCC The vote reclassifying broadband providers as common carriers under Title II came after 4 million Americans made their voices heard to @FCC.

GOP bill "would reduce spending on Medicaid by $800+ billion, the largest single ↓ in a social insurance program in our nation’s history.”
I also heard from nursing home resident in Moorhead who said GOP plan isn’t about taking care of people but about “survival of the fittest.”
#Medicaid is critical to her mom’s nursing home care. Even though she and her husband work full-time, they cannot afford care her mom needs.
In Perham, Minnesota, I heard from a woman who was in tears. She doesn't know where her mom will go if GOP health care bill guts #Medicaid.

My presumption is that after tomorrow's Senate Intel Committee hearing, there will still be questions that AG Jeff Sessions needs to answer.
Because after recusing himself from the Trump-Russia investigation, AG Sessions recommended firing the man in charge of that investigation.
I want answers abt his contacts w/ the Russians, &amp; I also want him to clarify why he found it proper to recommend ousting of FBI Dir. Comey.
In the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing tomorrow, I hope that Attorney General Sessions will provide the American people with answers.
And now news outlets have reported that he may have concealed 3rd meeting with Russian ambassador, which if true, is serious transgression.
We know Russia interfered w/ electoral process &amp; that then-Sen. Sessions failed to tell truth abt meetings last year w/ Russian ambassador.
Glad AG Sessions will testify publicly, but I'm concerned by his evasiveness, misrepresentations, and suspicious ties to Russian officials.

@HouseGOP @POTUS And my message to @POTUS, who's promised to defend workers and those struggling to make ends meet, is stop attacking people who elected you.
@HouseGOP @POTUS I will oppose this disastrous, backwards bill every step of the way in the Senate, bc I represent MN families &amp; businesses—not Wall Street.
@HouseGOP @POTUS This is a giveaway to Wall Street bigwigs who are salivating over the opportunity to once again gamble w/ Americans’ $$$ w/o repercussions.
@HouseGOP But now, by attempting to give bankers &amp; hedge fund managers control over our economy, GOP and @POTUS are inviting another financial crisis.
@HouseGOP When we passed Dodd-Frank, we did so to clean up Wall Street and protect Americans who lost their jobs, homes, &amp; retirement savings in 2008.
@HouseGOP Dodd-Frank was put in place seven years ago to help safeguard middle-class families from another massive financial meltdown.
In a dangerous move, @HouseGOP—at the behest of President Donald Trump—voted to rip apart the landmark Wall Street reform law Dodd-Frank.
Yesterday, while the country was focused on James Comey’s Senate testimony, Republicans tried to pull a fast one on the American people.

President Trump wants American people &amp; Congress to let this thing go. That’s not an option when the integrity of our democracy is at stake.
Now more than ever we should be encouraged that there’s special prosecutor to get to bottom of what happened bt Trump’s team &amp; the Russians.
Former Director Comey's testimony makes the case even stronger that the President has continuously tried to undermine that investigation.
It’s clear that President Trump fired former FBI Director James Comey because of the Trump-Russia investigation. #ComeyHearing

@HouseGOP @SenateGOP @POTUS As Co-chair of bipartisan Senate Rural Health Caucus, I believe GOP's proposed cuts to #Medicaid are a disservice to our rural communities.
@HouseGOP @SenateGOP @POTUS Medicaid also helps protect rural families against medical debt and bankruptcy, and improves economic insecurity. https://t.co/Cm3R67V7Ow
And I want to call @HouseGOP, @SenateGOP, @POTUS attention to fact that in nearly all states at least 1/3 of kids have #Medicaid coverage. https://t.co/ZdPWjKoYUh
MN is one of 10 states with the greatest increase in % of children covered by #Medicaid in rural areas in the years after ACA’s passage.
Medicaid is a lifeline for rural communities in MN and our nation. It's unacceptable that the GOP health care bill would gut the program.
Given that so many of my constituents live in small towns &amp; frontier areas, &amp; on farms &amp; reservations, rural health care is a top priority.
Nearly 62 million people in our country—one in five Americans—live in rural areas. 1.2 million in Minnesota alone.

@SenateGOP @HouseGOP @POTUS You can read more about my Improving Access to Affordable Prescription Drugs Act ahead of the hearing here: https://t.co/wSlSxKPakq
I urge @SenateGOP, @HouseGOP, and @POTUS to take a look at my bill, which provides blueprint for us to start working on this serious issue.
So next week in the hearing, I look forward to talking about legislation I introduced to bring down skyrocketing prescription drug costs.
Look, this shouldn’t be partisan issue. I think it’s safe to say that almost all of us know someone who's been affected by high drug prices.
And mark your calendars, because I’m pleased to say the Senate Health Committee hearing is officially scheduled for next Tuesday the 13th.
I’m glad I could help get things started by working to secure a bipartisan Senate Health Committee hearing on rising cost of Rx drug prices.
Big drug corporations continue to put profits b4 people &amp; set prices beyond the reach of Minnesotans. We need to stop this dangerous trend.
No American should have to skip meals or turn off their heat in order to afford their meds, but right now, that’s exactly what’s happening.
Millions of people in the US are being stretched thin by burdensome Rx drug prices—&amp; for many, it’s forcing them to make difficult choices.

My bill would do just that, and you can read more about my Advancing Career Pathways Innovation Act here: https://t.co/dllSGFBbgB
Traveling around MN, I've seen ground-breaking partnerships b/t schools &amp; biz that work, &amp; they work well. I want to scale them ↑ across US.
And last month, I held my Advancing Career Pathways Summit in St. Paul to showcase these successful and innovative school-biz partnerships.
Last year, my staff and I kicked off Advancing Career Pathways Tour to 17 MN communities to highlight ways schools are partnering with biz.
I'm supporting @SenatorDurbin bill w/ @SenateDems that would once again allow privately issued student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy.
But when that debt becomes too much to bear &amp; private loan borrowers end up underwater, there’s no way to clean the slate. We need to help.
And often, borrowers who have to take out private loans are stuck with much higher monthly payments and massive interest charges.
Student loan debt is a real front-burner issue for Minnesotans, who graduate college with an average of over $30,000 in debt.
My bipartisan bill with @amyklobuchar would memorialize sacrifice and service of Hmong veterans. More info here: https://t.co/0xJIZBgXeH
So I believe we must remember Hmong veterans who fought alongside Americans during the Vietnam War—&amp; continue to honor them after they pass.
I've said this before, but it remains true: because of Hmong soldiers' heroism, there are many fewer names on the Vietnam Memorial.

@FCC @AjitPaiFCC I’m going to be fighting to protect #NetNeutrality, and I hope that you will too, because every American deserves a free and open internet.
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC If you happen to agree with me and think this sounds like a terrible idea, then now is the time to mobilize and fight back.
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC The truth is there's no good reason to scrap #NetNeutrality, unless you want to give giant ISPs the power to establish fast and slow lanes.
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC Because massive corporations want it.
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC We also know that @AjitPaiFCC main argument against strong #NetNeutrality protections doesn't hold water. So why is he doing this?
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC So we know #NetNeutrality benefits consumers, businesses, entrepreneurs, and it promotes the free exchange of ideas on the internet.
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC For example, Charter’s CEO told investors at the end of 2016 that #NetNeutrality rules “didn’t really hurt us; it hasn’t hurt us.”
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC That’s just not true. And we know that because the ISPs themselves have told their shareholders that it’s not true. https://t.co/1lrRziStWE
@FCC @AjitPaiFCC @AjitPaiFCC claims we need to abandon strong #NetNeutrality protections because they are bad for broadband investment.
@FCC But @AjitPaiFCC, the head of the @FCC, is intent on eliminating the very protections that safeguard an open internet.
@FCC #NetNeutrality allows a small business in Minnesota to compete with the big guys, it drives innovation, and it protects free speech.
@FCC That means what you read, see, or watch on the internet can't be favored, blocked, or slowed down based on where the content is coming from.
@FCC Let me explain: For as long as the internet has existed, it's been grounded on the principle of #NetNeutrality.
Tomorrow the @FCC will vote on whether to protect #NetNeutrality or move toward destroying the internet as we know it.

.@POTUS It's now clearer than ever that we need an independent investigation into Trump's ties to Russia.
.@POTUS .@POTUS' stated reasons for firing Comey are difficult to believe and we need to get to the bottom of why this happened.
It is deeply troubling that @POTUS fired the person in charge of investigating his ties to Russia.

.@SenatorBaldwin President Trump expressed support for putting an end to the carried interest loophole, and if he’s serious, it's time for him to deliver.
.@SenatorBaldwin I believe those dollars could be better spent on things like education, investments in research and development, and infrastructure.
.@SenatorBaldwin The costly, unfair tax loophole goes to just a few of the wealthiest Americans each yr &amp; costs taxpayers in MN &amp; across the nation billions.
.@SenatorBaldwin The carried interest loophole allows wealthiest Americans to avoid paying their fair share of taxes at expense of middle-class Minnesotans.

These agreements keep residents &amp; families from seeking justice in the courts for claims related to negligence, injury, even wrongful death.
Their proposal would scrap protections that prevent long-term care facilities from locking residents into forced arbitration agreements.
The Trump Administration is planning to lift the ban on nursing home #ForcedArbitration clauses, which would be terrible for seniors.

.@POTUS .@POTUS Executive Order deeming monuments subject to review is wrong, and is attempt to undermine important conservation tool in our nation.

.@HouseGOP Your stories matter. Thanks to all the Minnesotans who’ve shared why @HouseGOP health plan is unacceptable. Keep making your voices heard.
.@HouseGOP Medicaid provides care for our kids, the elderly, and people with disabilities. And yes, @HouseGOP wants to gut &amp; completely change program.
.@HouseGOP .@HouseGOP is making a bad bill even worse. Their health bill still cuts and dismantles Medicaid as we know it.
.@HouseGOP .@HouseGOP amendment would also allow insurers to decline coverage for services people need like Rx drugs, mental health &amp; hospital visits.
.@HouseGOP amendment removes #ACA protections for Americans w/ pre-existing conditions &amp; allows insurers to charge ↑ based on health status.

.@FCC @AjitPaiFCC For as long as the internet has existed, it’s been grounded on the principle of #NetNeutrality. https://t.co/FSBEd5jPH4
.@FCC @AjitPaiFCC Let me be very clear: getting rid of #NetNeutrality would destroy the internet as we know it. I plan to fight @FCC @AjitPaiFCC's proposal.
But the new head of the @FCC, @AjitPaiFCC, announced that he’s putting the rules that safeguard #NetNeutrality on the chopping block.
#NetNeutrality makes sure that giant corporations—like Comcast and AT&amp;T—can’t pick and choose what content consumers can access.
#NetNeutrality allows a small business in Minnesota to compete on a level playing field with the big guys.
#NetNeutrality is the principle that internet content shouldn’t be favored, blocked, or slowed down based on where it’s coming from.

.@POTUS Thanks @SenStabenow &amp; @senrobportman for understanding this is important issue &amp; organizing Great Lakes Task Force discussion on Asian Carp. https://t.co/yxyWzwgvZV
.@POTUS This is unacceptable. Restoration and preservation of Great Lakes &amp; Upper Mississippi River Basin should be major environmental priorities.
So far, @POTUS Admin has shown complete lack of interest or understanding on this issue, delaying release of studies and proposing cuts.
Invasive carp in the Great Lakes or Minnesota's lakes and rivers would prove disastrous for our fishing, boating, and tourism industries.
I'm glad @CommerceGov has shown support for MN &amp; taken initial step of levying new tariffs on these unfair imports. https://t.co/LVe4Z7y8YV
That's why I've long called on the federal gov't to crack down on the subsidized Canadian softwood lumber that's flooding across our border.

.@POTUS There's so much excitement for construction of the center in Duluth that there's even a livestream of the progress: https://t.co/wPEi207YHc
.@POTUS The Center for Changing Lives in Duluth will help at-risk, homeless youth. And @POTUS wants to cut funding that makes this project possible.
I’ll also be in Duluth to highlight importance of federal community development grants. Quick note: @POTUS has proposed to eliminate these.
Tomorrow, I'll be hearing from Minnesotans in Cloquet about prescription drug prices and why we need to pass my legislation now.
I want to bring ↓ drug prices for Americans. That's why I recently introduced legislation to bring much-need relief to families and seniors.
Skyrocketing prescription drug prices often put essential, life-saving medicines out of reach for too many people in Minnesota &amp; our nation.

To all who are celebrating Easter in Minnesota &amp; across the nation, I hope you're spending the holiday surrounded by loved ones and friends.

I’ve introduced legislation w/ @ChuckGrassley to increase the transparency of college costs for students &amp; families. https://t.co/ZFWwB7dDOH
But, unfortunately, many of our young people and their families are finding it more and more difficult to pay for college.

Are you a Minnesotan needing help with a federal agency? My staff will be at Albert Lea Community Center from 11 AM - 1 PM to lend a hand.
The Tax Filing Simplification Act of 2017 would simplify tax filing process and cut costs for millions of taxpayers. https://t.co/j2n2vqfH7a
I’ve helped reintroduce bill that would simplify unnecessarily complex process Minnesotans &amp; all Americans go through to file federal taxes.

I've joined my colleagues in Congress in asking United Airlines to clear up passenger policies. Our letter here: https://t.co/oOYtULtCRT
Like many Minnesotans, I am both concerned and disturbed by what took place, and it’s clear that United needs to improve their practices.
By now, you’ve probably seen the video from the past weekend of a man being forcibly dragged off a United Airlines flight.
I'm going to keep fighting for my bill because it's about time our laws put families and consumers over corporate greed.
It's time to fight back. Drug companies have been ripping off consumers to boost their bottom line for far too long. https://t.co/WFkPtJNmTA
.@SenateDems They’re pouring money into “independent" orgs who advocate against bills that would help consumers but hurt Big Pharma’s bottom line.
.@SenateDems So it’s not surprising that the pharmaceutical industry and other powerful interests have already launched attacks on our legislation.
.@SenateDems Our Improving Access to Affordable Prescription Drugs Act puts consumers’ health and well-being ahead of corporate profits.
I recently led a milestone effort with my fellow @SenateDems to bring down prescription drug prices for Minnesotans and Americans.
.@CenterOnBudget Cuts to @MedicaidGov would jeopardize needed coverage for addiction and substance use disorder treatment. We need to expand it, not gut it.
#ICYMI, @CenterOnBudget report breaks down how potential cuts to #Medicaid would impact our country. Minnesota alone could lose $21 billion.
Because of #Medicaid expansion under #ACA, millions of Americans with substance use disorders have accessed treatment and care they need.

It’s my job to look out for these workers on MN's Iron Range and across our country, and that’s why I’ve reached out to @SecretaryRoss.
Minnesota’s iron and steel industry has suffered greatly from dumping of an array of foreign steel products. It has only begun to recover.
#HappyPassover from my family to all those who will gather tonight to celebrate in Minnesota, our nation, and across the world. #ChagSameach
.@UMDMensHockey missed it by that much...nearly came back to win NCAA championship. Bulldogs made #StateofHockey proud with a great season.
.@SenatorShaheen bill would build on provisions in existing law that I championed to more broadly protect survivors. https://t.co/EZrqGSXnBQ
I've been fighting to change that bc I believe we should be doing everything in our power to support survivors of these terrible crimes.
But that’s exactly what’s happening right now across the country.
It's unconscionable to think someone could be evicted—or outright denied housing—bc they've experienced domestic violence or sexual assault.
Good luck to the @UMDMensHockey team tomorrow. Hope you can bring the Frozen Four national championship trophy home to the #StateofHockey.
Earlier today, I sat down w/ @CoryBooker to talk about our legislative package to bring ↓ prescription drug prices. https://t.co/9wXfsf6cmA https://t.co/piY5LpNF2z

I’m proud to co-sponsor the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would help close the wage gap and ensure that women receive fairer pay.
That’s an outrage, and there’s no excuse for not taking real action right now to change it.
But unfortunately, in 2017 women in America are still fighting pervasive and	significant wage discrimination.
It’s simple. Women deserve to be paid equally for equal work. #EqualPayDay
Glad my office was invited to attend First Ship Ceremony to highlight importance of shipping industry to MN &amp; welcome the captain and crew. https://t.co/oyBguAMvfF
First "saltie" ship to arrive in Port of Duluth-Superior reminds Minnesotans and MN visitors alike that Duluth is an international seaport.
I'll keep pressing Trump admin to step up fight against trade cheats that put MN's steel, lumber, paper, ag, and other industries at risk.
I’m pleased to see new actions to help address trade abuses by other countries and to look out for MN Iron Rangers. https://t.co/y9nc0HgIdM

Judge Gorsuch is not a consensus nominee like Merrick Garland and he should not be confirmed to U.S. Supreme Court. https://t.co/ycLYbcYYbs
I'll continue fighting against efforts to undermine Minnesotans' privacy rights b/c I work for consumers, not deep-pocketed corporations.
But in case you missed it, when Senate GOP voted to kill #BroadbandPrivacy rules last week, they opened that door. https://t.co/Tr52p3lart

Met with health professionals, staff, &amp; families of residents at St. Crispin Living Community to discuss needs of seniors in Red Wing &amp; MN. https://t.co/YV3YmHjI8S
I'll also be sitting down with the organization’s providers and staff to hear how current efforts to repeal #ACA would hurt patients and MN.
I’ll be touring a clinic today that provides important health services for Minnesota families in Rice County.
As GOP Republicans are pushing a terrible bill in Washington, I'll be meeting w/ my constituents to talk about health care in Faribault, MN.
I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass it into law. More about our bill here: https://t.co/xdrdcj9YTx
Our bill could also support professional development opportunities for educators in Minnesota who teach courses in dual enrollment programs.
Our commonsense, bipartisan bill would help more high school students earn college credits before they pay a dime in tuition.
.@SenGaryPeters, Sens. Cassidy &amp; @JohnBoozman, &amp; I want to help families grappling w/ skyrocketing costs &amp; crippling debt after graduation.
As a member of @HELPCmteDems, one of my top priorities is to help make college more affordable for Minnesota students and families.
Thanks, @Teamstersjc32. I'll keep fighting on behalf of workers in Minnesota and across our country. https://t.co/QCbiDNLvwI
In Otter Tail County alone, almost 3,000 Minnesotans would lose health care coverage under the GOP health care plan. https://t.co/u9bPiTRJyu
It would destroy #Medicaid as we know it, hurting Minnesotans like Maria. More on her story here: https://t.co/r496jV9DHc
Their plan would be 1st health reform effort to actually cause Americans to lose insurance—ripping coverage away from estimated 24M by 2026.
GOP leaders and @POTUS are attempting to ram a disastrous health bill through the legislative process.
Today, @SenateGOP voted to kill #BroadbandPrivacy rules, which is extremely disappointing. My full statement here: https://t.co/Tr52p3lart
I also brought up the fact to another witness that Judge Gorsuch has evaded ???s about personal judgement &amp; decision-making. #GorsuchHearing https://t.co/BH6yklZWqJ
You can learn more about our bipartisan bill, the Hatch-Franken Child Protection Improvement Act of 2017, here: https://t.co/KtFzYZ7adf
My bipartisan bill with @senorrinhatch would improve child safety and help give parents confidence that their kids are in good hands.
Judge Gorsuch agreed with the employer in that case, which isn’t just disturbing, but also gives us a glimpse into his judicial philosophy.
The truck driver’s trailer brakes were frozen, but he was fired for abandoning the trailer in order to avoid freezing to death. Watch: https://t.co/FpC8lj3WSs

“There is no humanity in this...my son has a right to live like everyone else.” Impact of GOP health bill on MN → https://t.co/vcZsptAmpk
That means, @SenateGOP, you should uphold #BroadbandPrivacy instead of voting to allow Americans' personal info to be sold to ↑ bidder.
Reminder to my @SenateGOP colleagues ahead of today's vote on #BroadbandPrivacy: your constituents should come before large corporations.
I’ll be fighting to pass a final budget in Congress that helps, rather than harms, our seniors in Minnesota and across our nation.
It troubles me that @POTUS' proposed budget would rip away vital funding from Meals on Wheels, which is devoted to helping older Americans.
Meals on Wheels helps keep our homebound seniors from going hungry.
#TBT to delivering meals across MN over the last few years—including in Rochester, Eden Prairie, St. Paul, &amp; Minneapolis—w/ Meals on Wheels. https://t.co/4tE0uqS6dS
Later, I'll be talking to @chrislhayes about #GorsuchHearing and more. Hope you tune in to the conversation on @allinwithchris tonight.
You can watch my full second round of my questioning of Judge Neil Gorsuch before the @senjudiciary Committee here: https://t.co/7KDd5H0aeg
And why did I bring this all up? Because multiple 5-4 #SCOTUS decisions have eroded Americans’ ability to seek justice when they're wronged.
I also shared that @GretchenCarlson joined me two weeks ago when I helped introduce a number of bills to crack down on these unfair clauses. https://t.co/7oJy6PzNDJ
I told Judge Gorsuch about how #forcedarbitration affected a MN soldier whose house was foreclosed on while he served in Iraq. WATCH ➝ https://t.co/8px3Va1fIM

Our bill continues our commitment to help miners on the Iron Range and their families. https://t.co/6r0wkInHVF
Measure I helped intro with @amyklobuchar, @USRepRickNolan can help laid-off workers affected by steel dumping receive support they deserve.
Our Iron Rangers were rocked by a painful economic downturn in the Northland that was caused by an influx of illegally priced Chinese steel.
Acts of terrorism have no place in our world. Heartbroken by what happened near British Parliament today.
WATCH LIVE ➝ I'll be questioning Judge Neil Gorsuch this afternoon before @senjudiciary Committee. https://t.co/fBvdjDuSK3 #GorsuchHearing
I don't work for big corporations. I work for you. So I'm pushing back against @SenateGOP efforts that would undermine #BroadbandPrivacy.
Consumers &gt; corporations. But @SenateGOP colleagues are planning to vote this week to allow your personal info to be sold to third parties.
Shipping season—w/ ships like the Roger Blough carrying iron ore mined at home in MN—is vital to Duluth and to Iron Range regional economy.
Cheers to the start of the 2017 shipping season for MN. Here’s the Roger Blough clearing the Aerial Bridge today in Port of Duluth-Superior. https://t.co/23bJ2GbBMc

Your stories matter. And I plan to continue sharing what my constituents throughout MN tell me with Senate colleagues in Washington. WATCH ➝ https://t.co/PlxhwCgDHa
Farmers, ranchers, and ag leaders in Minnesota and across our nation are the backbone of our economy. Thanks for all you do. #NationalAgDay
We talked about needed changes in farm policy, and I'll be sharing what I've heard in MN with my colleagues in Washington. #NationalAgDay
I was also happy to be joined by some Minnesotans who are the future of agriculture in our state, @MNFFA members. #NationalAgDay #MNAg
Last week, I sat down w/ farmers &amp; ag leaders incl. @MNagriculture Commissioner Frederickson in Moorhead to talk about current farm economy.
That’s exactly what I’ve been doing throughout MN to get input about how next Farm Bill can best support our ag community. #NationalAgDay
With one in five MN jobs tied to agriculture, it's important to bring together farmers, ranchers, &amp; ag leaders in our state. #NationalAgDay
Last week, I toured @ISD191 Burnsville High School as part of my office’s statewide Advancing Career Pathways Tour. https://t.co/hb3FoQgBab

Thanks to Minnesotans who were w/ me in Brooklyn Center, Burnsville, Detroit Lakes, Perham, and Moorhead last week. https://t.co/fkKwl9ZbPH
"I really like this job. I like representing the people of Minnesota." Read @ktumulty's piece here: https://t.co/iZoM3hfJZ9
Families in Moorhead shared how cuts to Medicaid in current GOP plan would "result in survival of the fittest." Unacceptable.
At Eventide Sr. Living in Moorhead, I heard how current plan to repeal the #ACA would hurt seniors, families, and rural nursing homes. https://t.co/funLyr4kA9
Thanks to Red River valley ag producers who shared what you want to see in the next Farm Bill w/ me in Moorhead today. Your input is vital. https://t.co/0knOxXfoxN
Great to have young Minnesotans with @MNFFA at my farm roundtable today in Moorhead. They are the future of agriculture. https://t.co/FiYlQZW7TZ

Congratulations to Minnesotan Louise Erdrich on your National Book Award. https://t.co/0Z377Buh12
I was also joined by @MinnesotaDHS @E_J_Piper in Perham. Emily, thanks for sharing expertise on what #ACA repeal would mean for Minnesotans. https://t.co/lnOnMztjeE
I heard firsthand from Minnesotans about impact #ACA repeal would have on rural communities in our state at a hospital in Perham today. https://t.co/DEk7b2guz7
Thanks for highlighting my visit to Brooklyn Center school, @EducationMN. And thanks for being a voice for educators, students in Minnesota.
Mushkaad is one of the reasons I pledge to keep fighting against travel bans that are wrong for Minnesota and our nation.
I finally got to meet four-year-old Mushkaad, who @amyklobuchar &amp; I helped reunite w/ her family in MN after @POTUS exec order kept	her out. https://t.co/yGZhZQ2yoH
Carrie, Jerry, Lonnie, and others with @aarpmn, thanks for making your voices heard. I will absolutely keep fighting to protect Medicare. https://t.co/eoXwgM4cmR
Great school visits in Brooklyn Center &amp; Burnsville today. Looking forward to discussing rural health care in Perham and Moorhead tomorrow.
This Minnesotan knows a thing or two about what #ACA repeal would mean for all Americans. https://t.co/cDnZEksHrP
Educators, local officials, and businesses are all working together at @ISD191 to close #skillsgap &amp; prepare students for 21st Century jobs. https://t.co/DkGQbtsDq9

The "wraparound” services incl. medical &amp; dental care, mental health, &amp; afterschool programs through 21st Century Community Learning Center.
MN Brooklyn Center Arts &amp; IB World School has raised students' academic performance by providing them &amp; their families w/ critical services.
Congrats @andrewzimmern as well on #JBFA recognition. Thanks for celebrating our communities &amp; cultures as MN’s unofficial food ambassador.
Minnesotans farm and cook some of the best food anywhere. Congrats to @ChefJorgeGuzman &amp; Steven Brown for being James Beard Award finalists.
Thanks to those in Marshall who sat down with my office to talk about preparing our students for jobs of the future. https://t.co/pAkrECfIrU
I'm inspired by school-business partnerships to address the #skillsgap—like the welding and nursing programs offered in Marshall.
Yesterday, my staff toured Marshall Area Technical &amp; Education Center in MN as part of my office’s statewide Advancing Career Pathways Tour. https://t.co/X5k1ZhG7jt
Old EO hurt MN families. Revised travel ban remains unacceptable, and glad to see a federal judge agrees. Hope we can soon put EO behind us.
More on my bipartisan bill to ensure mobilized @NationalGuard and Reserve troops have access to important benefits: https://t.co/CKFW6QPmXr
I've introduced legislation with @SenCapito, Sen. @amyklobuchar, and Sen. @JohnCornyn to provide fairness in benefits among deployed troops.
I'm committed to continuing efforts with @SenDuckworth to help train workers for open, high-skills jobs in the Midwest &amp; across our nation.
Our bill–the Community College to Career Fund Act–would help train workers for jobs in industries like advanced manufacturing, clean energy.
That's why I've reintroduced commonsense legislation with @SenDuckworth that encourages school-business partnerships to address #skillsgap.
I want to help boost businesses and create more jobs by helping to make school-business partnerships available to all Americans.
Just today, my office sat down with Marshall HS students in southwestern part of our state to learn about school-business partnerships. https://t.co/E6uHmfk1aK
I’ve seen partnerships between community colleges, technical colleges, and biz to train students to fill high-demand jobs work all over MN.
And thanks to @MNSoybean for everything you do–not only for #biodiesel and soybean industry in Minnesota–but also for our state's economy.
We must stand up for a strong renewable fuel standard and continue to push for the expanded use of #biodiesel in MN and across the country.
Today, as we mark 15th anniversary of MN's #biodiesel standard, it’s now more important than ever that we stand together on national level.
As a member of @EnergyDems, I understand how important #biodiesel has been to creating jobs and economic development across Minnesota.
#ICYMI I've urged @POTUS for plan to fight avian flu outbreak for farmers in MN &amp; across the nation. https://t.co/ny53Op0Rjq via @duluthnews

Looking forward to Wed. breakfast w/ constituents. 2nd week in a row that we've had to move to larger space bc so many Minnesotans are in DC
We need to do everything we can to support farmers. My letter urging @POTUS to address avian flu outbreak here: https://t.co/brpOQtshOV https://t.co/BhG4iC2EVW
My Republican colleagues in Congress should abandon their harmful effort &amp; work on plan that would actually help Minnesotans, all Americans.
And @MedicaidGov? Nonpartisan @USCBO report shows GOP health care plan would end Medicaid as we know it.
GOP plan would force rural hospitals, nursing facilities to close, limit access to providers, and jeopardize health care jobs in Minnesota.
Nonpartisan @USCBO report makes clear what we already know: The GOP health care plan would hurt people in Minnesota and across the country.
Nonpartisan @USCBO report: Congressional Republicans' plan would rip coverage away from 24 million people.

Grateful to @ymca for working w/ me on #Diabetes Prevention Program, &amp; I was honored to accept their Congressional Champion award last week. https://t.co/MuFDHnQzMd
Diabetes Prevention Program helped seniors stay healthy and saved enrollees $2,600+ in @MedicareGov costs. That's a win-win for our nation.
The @ymca tested whether providing the #DPP as a @MedicareGov benefit improved care and reduced spending. The results were impressive.
And, thanks in large part to @ymca, we know that Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) can help prevent personal &amp; financial costs for families.
Seven yrs ago, I worked with GOP Sen. Richard Lugar to secure significant ↑ in funding for Diabetes Prevention Program as part of the #ACA.
Diabetes takes a toll on families. Half of Americans aged 65 or older have #prediabetes or are at risk of developing type 2 #diabetes.
I’ve long been working to address the #skillsgap, and I’m glad my staff was able to attend an event like this in MN. https://t.co/sigdLOtf7w
Last week, nearly 1,000 students in Duluth got the chance to experience work performed in various building and construction trade careers. https://t.co/ON75XOaP0z
Along w/ local public health, we agree Congressional Republicans' plan could have devastating effects in Minnesota. https://t.co/hcahARhYs2
Yes, GOP plan could hurt our public health infrastructure and harm state's ability to respond to outbreaks and disasters.
.@eehlinger and I talked about how GOP bill would ↑ costs for many people, offer ↓ quality coverage, and would end #Medicaid as we know it.
Last week, I sat down with @mnhealth's @eehlinger to talk about what #ACA repeal and @MedicaidGov reform would look like for Minnesotans.
Congrats to MN Boy's State HS hockey champs @HAHA_Hockey in Class A, &amp; to @GRhockeyHS in Class AA. Another great tourney in #StateofHockey.

Today, my staff attended 10th Annual Bridges Career Exploration Day at @clcmnedu. Great to see 2,000+ HS students experiencing 150+ careers. https://t.co/E8BKA3vOoP
While there, I learned about Bridges Career Academies, which offer students in MN the opportunity to explore career paths in high school.
Last month, I toured manufacturer Avantech, a company in Baxter, MN that’s training students for jobs of the future &amp; addressing #skillsgap.
.@BetsyDeVos, the decision to revoke Title IX guidance on transgender students is disturbing. We want answers. https://t.co/Ao7KprrC2U https://t.co/8OkH4iMuLv

While my entry—influenced by a dish my mom used to make for me in St. Louis Park—didn't win, 7th annual hotdish competition was a success.

#ICYMI I called for end to #ForcedArbitration w/ @gretchencarlson, @RepHankJohnson, @senatedems incl. @SenatorLeahy. https://t.co/ZtXQRN28R8
THIS JUST IN ➝ The winner of my 7th Annual Minnesota Congressional Delegation Hotdish Competition is... https://t.co/m3Nt0UkEEV
Had to move my Wed. constituent breakfast (my favorite part of the week, FYI) to a bigger room because so many Minnesotans are visiting DC. https://t.co/kEUEAU4MaX
Based on the recipes we've received—that I'll be sharing with you after event today—my 7th hotdish off is going to be a tough competition. https://t.co/1FGow86lpH
Just after 9 PM CT, I'll be on @TheLastWord. I'll be telling @Lawrence about need for our attorney general to be honest w/ American public.
AG Jeff Sessions owes it to Minnesotans and all Americans to come before @senjudiciary Committee again and explain. https://t.co/zkeGtyLVus
TODAY ➝ I'll highlight need to end #RipOffClause w/ @RepHankJohnson, @housedemocrats, @SenateDems incl. @SenatorLeahy, and @GretchenCarlson.
We shouldn’t be rewarding companies that cheat workers and endanger their safety. My full Senate floor speech here: https://t.co/KwL5R1AeQ5 https://t.co/bwuJMEHiLR
GOP colleagues need to go back to the drawing board on #ACA repeal. And solicit input from constituents this time. https://t.co/iwxQMmLMWp
We'll be hearing from Americans, including @GretchenCarlson, whose access to justice has been curtailed by #ForcedArbitration. #RipOffClause
Tomorrow, I'll be joined by fellow @SenateDems and number of @HouseDemocrats to introduce our legislation to end #ForcedArbitration clauses.
It can be hard for consumers to get the evidence they need to prove their case, and there’s no meaningful judicial review.
Instead, consumers &amp; workers are forced into an arbitration system where corporations can write the rules. Everything can be done in secret.
#ForcedArbitration clauses are buried in contracts and they strip consumers and workers in MN and our nation of their right to go to court.
From nursing home contracts to cell phone contracts, too often big corporations use fine print to restrict Americans’ access to justice.
WEDNESDAY ➝ My 7th annual competition to determine which member of MN's Congressional Delegation makes best hotdish. https://t.co/H1CW4CpvKk

Thanks to members of the MN Police and Peace Officers Association for meeting with me last week and for working to keep Minnesotans safe. https://t.co/XaGIEIrzzh
Disappointed #SCOTUS won't hear Gavin's case, but let’s be clear: Title IX &amp; Constitution still protect trans students from discrimination.
Coming up on @ThisWeekABC, I'll be discussing Attorney General Jeff Sessions and more from #ThisWeek.
This week, I had the chance to meet with the Minnesota Agriculture Rural Leadership Program #MARLClassIX. Thanks to @MARLprogram leaders. https://t.co/FeW3jT9jBb

Tune into @MSNBC @Morning_Joe around 7 AM CT. I'll be joining to talk about Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
Very troubled that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had contact with Russian official despite testifying otherwise. https://t.co/ak9sU6EOmk
Our legislation would support a workforce model that fills open jobs, lowers education costs for students, and makes USA more competitive.
I’ve seen these partnerships work all over MN, &amp; I want to scale it up to help all Americans and train workers for high-skill industry jobs.
Our Community College to Career Fund Act encourages partnerships that link businesses up with two-year schools to train workers.
We have a bill to fix that, and we're going to be reintroducing it along with @RepRobinKelly soon.
.@SenDuckworth and I have heard from business owners in the Midwest who have unfilled jobs because they can’t find workers w/ right skills.
MN State Commander Joe Mauricio joined me for #JointAddress last night, and I'm glad I could meet with him and other @VFWHQ members today. https://t.co/cnXvt156Fh
#ICYMI, I urged @POTUS to support @NEAarts because federal support for the arts is critical to our American institutions.
Today I talked with members of @DAVofMN about the first bill I ever introduced, which aimed to increase the number of service dogs for vets. https://t.co/ebGUKsGaw6
Thanks @MNCounties for inviting me to speak at annual legislative breakfast. Here's a glimpse at what I told MN County Commissioners today: https://t.co/0jQbFkVVa4
It's the first day of March, but you can see what I learned in my meetings with Minnesotans in February here: https://t.co/u02GiU6Oxq
There were things in #JointAddress I didn't agree with, but I'll continue to hold @POTUS accountable &amp; work for MN. https://t.co/Jd6VMgkq80

It also explains the work I'm doing to help homeless students access housing and provide broadband to families and veterans.
In my North Star Newsletter, you'll learn about my recent stops in Greater MN to talk with Minnesotans about the issues that matter to them.
Let’s not rip away coverage. Let’s stabilize insurance market, reduce Rx prices, and ensure Americans who need health care aren't denied it.
But you know who does understand? The people who’ve lived w/—&amp; without—the ACA. And these Minnesotans can tell you: https://t.co/slAwgongrC
.@POTUS making such an absurd statement after calling for #ACA repeal shows he doesn’t understand irresponsible path he's leading us down.
While talking about his plan to scrap the #ACA &amp; its life-saving protections, @POTUS said "nobody knew health care could be so complicated."
Roy Wilkins—namesake of @RoyWilkinsUMN and @TheRoyWilkins—spent formative years in MN before going on to head the @NAACP. #BlackHistoryMonth

I'm going to urge @betsydevos to expand workforce training opportunities for young people, which is an area she has signaled interest in.
I also said I want to find common ground to help students succed. One way to do that is through workforce development in K-12 schools.
He asked about the @usedgov nominee hearing. I told him I plan to press the new Ed Sec. to support public education &amp; students in Minnesota.
Oscar is 12 years old &amp; in 6th grade.​ He recently reached out &amp; asked me to answer some questions about what's been going on in our nation.

As we await more details, my thoughts are with those who lost loved ones in the terrorist bombing in Somalia.
Here’s AT&amp;T and Time Warner's response. It does not ease my concern that deal could lead to worse service for you. https://t.co/iwT2nNasGx
I got some of my colleagues together &amp; asked AT&amp;T, Time Warner to demonstrate that mega-merger is in the interest of all of you—the public.
By avoiding @FCC review, AT&amp;T and Time Warner are avoiding having to prove that the deal will benefit consumers and promote competition.
That’s why I was troubled when AT&amp;T and Time Warner signaled that they were structuring mega-merger to circumvent @FCC review.
Further consolidation in telecommunications and media industries should only be permitted if it results in better services for consumers.
A while back, I asked AT&amp;T and Time Warner to explain to me whether their $85 billion bid to merge is truly in the interest of Americans.
Glad fellow Minnesotans @keithellison and @RepErikPaulsen have introduced the measure in the House. Read more here: https://t.co/2qTTSAD3jI
My bipartisan legislation would close loophole that prevents many full-time college students from qualifying for affordable rental housing.
Nobody in Minnesota &amp; our nation should have to face that kind of crisis—especially during MN winters. That's why I've intro'd bill to help.
Right now, there are young people in our nation who can't focus on their education bc they don't know where they’re going to sleep at night.
Mr. Pruitt represents a step backward, not a step forward. I'm urging my colleagues to join me in opposing @AGScottPruitt's nomination. https://t.co/p8JuRc1Eu4
We cannot afford to entrust the @EPA to someone that @POTUS has handpicked to slash its budget and prevent it from carrying out its mission.
We cannot afford to entrust the @EPA to @AGScottPruitt who has a history of putting polluters’ interests ↑ the public's.
Addressing environmental challenges—like climate change—also spurs economic growth and innovation. Watch what we've been done in Minnesota: https://t.co/JmhrtBGVDN
And what’s more, @EPA is helping consumers save money. Take fuel efficiency standards. They reduce air pollution and save people $$$.
Americans believe that a great country deserves safe drinking water, clean air, and a hospitable environment. That's where @EPA comes in. https://t.co/RKRzmjYEUo
You can read a summary of my bipartisan bill with @senrobportman—called the Housing for Homeless Students Act—here: https://t.co/kGcRtsJl4J
My bill with GOP @senrobportman would allow full-time students who've experienced homelessness to stay in low-income housing.
Thanks to the hundreds of health advocates who I saw at @FamiliesUSA's conference, including delegation from Minnesota. Your work is vital.

Thanks to everyone who came out—my staff enjoyed meeting so many great people in Rochester and helping Minnesotans at @IMAARochester.
On Tuesday, my staff was on hand at @IMAARochester to make sure Minnesotans get the help they need when working with federal agencies.
If you're unsure of where to start when contacting fed agencies like @DeptVetAffairs, @SocialSecurity, and @MedicareGov, my office can help.
MN hasn't suffered from immigrants—it's thrived because of them. I stand in solidarity with #DayWithoutImmigrants. https://t.co/yxezCAlIXi
Today, most of Minnesota's immigrants come from Asia, Latin America, and Africa. And their contributions to our state are just as important.
Norwegians were critical to logging industry, while the Danes, who came to MN after the Civil War, made our state a leader in dairy farming.
MN fields were first tilled by Swedish immigrants. Their crops filled two million acres. Iron mines in the north depended on Finnish labor.

I’ll be voting no on Mnuchin this evening. And I have suggestions for @POTUS if he really wants to drain the swamp. https://t.co/dxjZWbcYyG
Mnuchin is example of @POTUS pulling one over on voters who elected him by stocking Cabinet, Admin with people who want to put banks first.
Trump team could easily be called the Admin formerly known as Goldman Sachs—including the man that the Senate is voting on for Treasury Sec.
The #OvertimeRule would help tens of thousands of Minnesota workers become eligible for overtime pay for the extra hours they work.
If @POTUS wants to support American workers, he should stop trying to dismantle Wall Street reform and stand up for the #OvertimeRule.
My bill lets #Medicare negotiate prices w/ Rx companies. Would save tens of billions per year, cut costs for seniors, and save taxpayer $$$.
After hearing concerns from MN seniors, I've intro'd a bill to cut prescription drug costs, save taxpayer dollars. https://t.co/jea6cPUM8D
Saddened to hear of former @MNAFLCIO President Dave Roe's passing. He was an integral part of the MN labor movement. https://t.co/6996mXd0n6
TOMORROW → Staff will be at @IMAARochester 2:30-6:30 PM to meet w/ Minnesotans who need help w/ federal agency. Free, no appointment needed.

My Senate colleagues &amp; I call on @FCC @AjitPaiFCC to reconsider decision that will deprive Americans of broadband. https://t.co/lTiMvLuXPM
But last week, @FCC's @AjitPaiFCC handed down a decision stopping nine broadband service providers from being a part of the vital program.
Last year, a federal program began to offer affordable broadband support in MN &amp; our nation to help low-income families, vets, and seniors.
Internet access is essential to conduct daily activities, pursue job &amp; housing opps, obtain health care services, &amp; stay in touch w family.
Project FINE helps immigrants and refugees in MN counties. Glad my staff attended annual report to the community event at @smumn this week.

#ICYMI Here’s my statement on #NinthCircuit ruling. I hope we can put this @POTUS harmful Executive Order behind us. https://t.co/Qc7oTCD58O
It's about time we pass my #Medicare negotiation bill. My bill will save taxpayer $, keep costs in check, &amp; put more $ in pocket of seniors.
Even President @realDonaldTrump has publicly expressed support for #Medicare negotiation policy. So I'm hopeful we can finally get it done.
Currently, #Medicare is barred from negotiating drug prices. My bill would change that, which could save Medicare up to $24 billion/year.
I've intro'd legislation that would bring ↓ cost of prescriptions for seniors by allowing Medicare to negotiate better deals w/ drug makers.
They told me skyrocketing Rx prices are forcing Minnesotans to make difficult decisions like choosing b/t paying bills or buying groceries.
When I held my Prescription Drug Listening Tour around MN last year, I heard concerns from seniors &amp; health providers about high Rx prices.
Ecouraged by decision that questions constitutionality of @POTUS terrible EO. Hope it's soon struck down for good. https://t.co/Qc7oTCD58O

Millions of Americans fought really hard to protect #NetNeutrality. @AjitPaiFCC, my colleagues &amp; I urge you to respect all of their voices.
.@AjitPaiFCC needs to protect #NetNeutrality because big companies shouldn't be able to buy "fast lanes" that small business can't afford.
So today, @SenMarkey, @SenSchumer, @SenatorLeahy, @RonWyden, @SenBlumenthal, and I stood up for #NetNeutrality w/ entrepreneurs, advocates. https://t.co/ZpRBtW0alv
I was troubled to learn that last week, new @FCC Chairman @AjitPaiFCC took a first step at whittling away at strong #NetNeutrality rules.
I've called #NetNeutrality the free speech issue of our time bc the basic principles of our democracy are at stake. @FCC needs to uphold it.
Bc of #NetNeutrality, the website for a local mom-and-pop store loads as quickly as website for a corporation. That's a level playing field.
Because of #NetNeutrality, people from across the world can connect with each other and share ideas on the internet.

A shame that GOP voted to confirm one of their major donors instead of looking out for our children. Full statement: https://t.co/7ibYt0SqAc
I'll be taking to the Senate floor one more time before vote at noon today to urge GOP colleagues to put kids before party lines. #NoOnDeVos
We shouldn’t accept fundamentally ill-equipped Ed Sec. The Constitution lets us do something about that. https://t.co/O6AMhqfOKL #NoOnDeVos
We wouldn’t accept a Treasury Secretary who doesn’t understand multiplication. #NoOnDeVos
We wouldn’t accept a Secretary of State who couldn’t identify Europe on a map. #NoOnDeVos
We wouldn’t accept a Secretary of Defense who couldn’t name the branches of the military. #NoOnDeVos
I asked @BetsyDeVos for her opinion on an extremely basic, extremely important question. She had no idea what I was talking about #NoOnDeVos
Betsy DeVos has no formal background in ed, no classroom experience, and demonstrated no commitment to supporting public ed. #NoOnDeVos
THOUSANDS of Minnesotans have contacted me to say #NoOnDeVos so I voiced their concerns on the Senate floor. WATCH: https://t.co/O6AMhqfOKL
GOP senators, if you cannot bring yourself to vote #NoOnDeVos, is there anyone @POTUS could nom for any position who you could vote against? https://t.co/76Tzan898b

#StreamProtectionRule updates standards that date back to 1983 during Reagan Admin to ensure communities have water that's safe to drink.
Minnesotans—I hear you. Thank you for the calls, letters, and emails. They matter.
More on Samira and Mushkaad's story here: https://t.co/7e9bgqbJNC 3/3.
This case proves @realdonaldtrump Order is hurting MN families because it was poorly thought out and executed, and above all, it’s wrong. /2
Update: I'm pleased that after I pressed @DHSgov a MN family affected by @realdonaldtrump reckless Executive Order has been reunited. /1
It’s my job to help amplify your voice. I’m committed to sharing why you believe we can’t take health coverage away &amp; should build on #ACA.
There are many other Minnesotans like Gina, Megan, and Leanna who have shared their fears about erasing the gains we’ve made under the #ACA.
Leanna says “it is bc of the #ACA that Henry gets proper healthcare. Henry can get therapy and the things he needs to maintain his health.”
Leanna is the mother of 3-yr-old Henry who is battling leukemia. W/o the #ACA, Henry wouldn’t be able to receive treatment &amp; care he needs.
Megan was dropped from her health coverage when she found out she was pregnant bc it was considered a preexisting condition prior to #ACA.
Before the #ACA, Gina lost her father because he hit lifetime cap and could not afford treatment he needed to battle cancer.
GOP needs to understand that while they've begun to pull the rug out from millions, there are Americans who are worried about their future.
GOP wants to turn back the clock &amp; repeal #ACA. Let me share what that means for Minnesotans. Email me at SaveMyCoverage@franken.senate.gov. https://t.co/3DDYc74ITM
Glad my staff highlighted Vantage Program in Minnetonka, one of many programs in MN working to address #skillsgap. https://t.co/9yuMpdqT9m https://t.co/tnUzIS96gu
Minnesota school-business partnerships are encouraging students to seek training for good-paying careers.
I've also been leading efforts to close nation's #skillsgap, which has left employers with unfilled jobs bc they can't find trained workers.
As a member of the Senate Ed Committee, I led a successful effort to expand #STEM edu during last year's re-write of No Child Left Behind.
We need to do more to help people, not move to voucher system that could harm hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans. https://t.co/VUqZGFPBp1
We need to do everything we can to help seniors in Minnesota and across the country. That's why I’ll fight to protect &amp; preserve #Medicare.

GOP says it’ll look out for everyday Americans. Where is their plan to help small business owners, families, farmers, &amp; more?​ #CareNotChaos
And I’ve heard the same thing from Minnesotans who are terrified about their future if #ACA is repealed.
Amy is worried she'll have to give up being self-employed if #ACA is repealed because only a company’s plan will offer her health benefits.
This is Amy from Kentucky who I met at a @HELPCmteDems event today. She's self-employed and she has Crohn's disease—a preexisting condition. https://t.co/DDFodlbyYP
GOP has already begun efforts to repeal the #ACA without a replacement plan, which would cause millions to lose coverage and premiums to ↑.

(Quick aside: never think that calling or writing your elected officials doesn’t make a difference. It does.)
Betsy DeVos is not fit to run Edu Dept. I believe that, and so do 20k Minnesotans who wrote me and 3k who called me about her nomination.

I’ll be taking an active role in upcoming debate over a new Farm Bill, so I'm glad to hear from our famers about policies they want to see.
The Blomgrens, local farmers, &amp; I talked about farm policy &amp; toll that several yrs of low farm prices has had on East Central MN producers.

If @POTUS wants to strengthen our elections, he should work to combat efforts to suppress minority voters in our nation.
To bring about change and reform, Minnesotans and people all over the country wield our power in the voting booth.
In Minnesota, we respect our right to vote. In fact, we consistently have the highest turnout in national elections.
Now, let’s pause for a fact check. @realDonaldTrump lost popular vote to tune of 2.86 million votes. That’s a fact, not an alternative fact.
Let me reiterate that: “the millions of people who voted illegally.” —@realDonaldTrump
"I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.” —@realDonaldTrump in a tweet he posted in late November

No family should ever have to go through this, and I brought this up in Congressman Price’s hearing today.
These were folks who hit annual limit, or went over lifetime cap, or maybe had pre-existing condition &amp; couldn’t buy insurance in 1st place.

Congrats to @AugsburgCollege and @HennepinTech for being recognized at the @whitehouse on Friday for work to help Minnesotans #GetCovered.
Subject: Why We Must Fight for the #ACA	Attn: @SpeakerRyan, @SenateMajLdr 	Cc: @HouseGOP, @SenateGOP 	https://t.co/v6u9xZJ1Oa
Thanks to all of the school board members who attended MN @mnmsba Leadership Conference this week, including 400+ new school board members.
Less than 24 hrs after hearing Jeff’s story, @SpeakerRyan &amp; @HouseGOP started process to repeal the #ACA without sharing plan to replace it.
“We wouldn’t do that, we want to replace it with something better.” —@SpeakerRyan when asked why GOP would repeal #ACA without replacement.
He asked bc when he was 49, Jeff was diagnosed w/ cancer &amp; given six weeks to live. He cares about the future of #ACA bc it saved his life.
At #RyanTownHall, Jeff Jeans—a lifelong Republican and a small-business owner—asked @SpeakerRyan why he'd repeal ACA without a replacement. https://t.co/HZtkA7v4Vy
After careful consideration of Senator Sessions' record, I do not think he is up to the task of being an attorney general for all Americans. https://t.co/OiXmNEf4SK
I'll be starting my Friday by talking to folks at @Morning_Joe. Hope you catch me on @MSNBC tomorrow morning around 7:20 AM CT/8:20 AM ET.

Today, my office learned about one such partnership at @nbaps, where they're helping students learn skills they need for in-demand jobs.
But in many parts of MN, employers and schools are partnering to help prepare students for 21st Century jobs and to address the #skillsgap.
I've heard from employers throughout MN who can't fill jobs bc they can't find ppl with the right training. This is known as the #skillsgap.
I voted no on a GOP resolution to begin gutting #ACA last night bc this is the replacement plan the Republicans have presented to Americans: https://t.co/D3XNqOWwUk
More on my efforts to lower Rx prices, protect rural health care, &amp; save successful consumer protection measure here https://t.co/3NAnbTo98n
I'll be introducing measures tonight to protect what's already in ACA, strengthen the law &amp; stop GOP from taking coverage from Minnesotans.
I believe we can and should be working to amend, build on, and improve the ACA—not rip it up like the Republicans are trying to do.
Republicans are gearing up to gut ACA without a replacement plan—a move that would take away protections from millions of Americans.
I'll be joining @ErinBurnett on @CNN from the Capitol around 7 PM ET/6 PM if you're in Minnesota.
Thanks to all of the emergency crews in southern Minnesota who helped workers in Dodge Center today. https://t.co/kIVrTMCLOx

I took to the Senate floor to make one request for my GOP colleagues who want to repeal ACA: show us your plan. https://t.co/Y7x7q2zAWB
HAPPENING NOW → I'll be questioning AG nom Sen. Jeff Sessions in @senjudiciary shortly. Watch live: https://t.co/O2RhMHyQ80 #SessionsHearing
I’ve talked to Minnesotans whose lives were saved by protections in ACA. I'll be sharing some of their stories shortly on the Senate floor.
Proud that my fellow @SenateDems know that we need to defend the ACA &amp; @PPFA, and work to move our country forward. https://t.co/m3TyRbcmO6
GOP lawmakers are gearing up to gut the ACA. What's the replacement plan they've presented?		We're still waiting.
My colleagues &amp; I have intro'd bill to require president-elect to uphold tradition &amp; divest financial withholdings. https://t.co/spRGnUFft6
The president must always put the interests of Americans ahead of his own personal $ interests. That shouldn't change with @realDonaldTrump.
I recently toured @cctwincitiesorg's Dorothy Day Place, which is working to better connect health and housing in Minnesota. https://t.co/QgKn5E914H
These illnesses represent significant barriers to obtaining and retaining safe, stable housing. We need to do more for Minnesotans.
According to #MNHomelessStudy, 60% of homeless adults report a significant mental illness and over 50% have a chronic health condition.
This weekend, I met with over 50 health care advocates in MN. They shared stories about how #ACA repeal would hurt Minnesota families. https://t.co/deRGE4zptv

Today, I heard from healthcare advocates about how repealing ACA—&amp; replacing it w/ nothing—would hurt MN. Thanks to all who shared stories. https://t.co/Lpi0j5zIhL
Thinking of the families who lost loved ones in Fort Lauderdale today.
Tell @SpeakerRyan that GOP shouldn't #MakeAmericaSickAgain. Tell them to resist impulse to let politics stand b/t women &amp; their health care.
.@SpeakerRyan, my fellow @SenateDems and I want you to stand w/ 2+ million Americans who visit @PPFA each year. Don't #MakeAmericaSickAgain.
We can't let the GOP defund @PPFA, repeal the ACA, &amp; put the health of American families at risk. We can't let them #MakeAmericaSickAgain.
The ability to access reproductive health care, like services @PPFA provides, has a powerful effect on the choices women and families make.
One in five women in our country has received care at Planned Parenthood. And for many women, @PPFA is their primary source of health care. https://t.co/QIkmzfXeVP
High Rx prices are putting seniors and Medicare Part D program at risk. We need commonsense legislation. More here: https://t.co/7DE3WgA6I9

(1/2) As a member of @HELPCmteDems, I recognize how painful #ACA repeal could be for people all across MN—particularly in rural communities.

(4/4) I have expressed these concerns to the companies, &amp; I look forward to continuing to work with them. More here: https://t.co/1LUs4EZgy2
(3/4) I appreciate steps that Uber, Lyft have taken to address my concerns about discrimination against consumers. But I want further steps.
(2/4) I asked Uber and Lyft how they plan to better guard against the kind of discrimination detailed in the study. I have their responses.
(1/4) I reached out to ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft when I heard about a recent study documenting discrimination against customers.
Hurting our nation's most vulnerable people isn't what elected leaders should do. That's why I'm committed to preserving Medicare, Medicaid.

I've long worked to promote #STEM education for boys AND girls. Glad to see STEM class empowering young Minnesotans. https://t.co/gdaULy5Ncv
(5/5) That's why I reached out to Uber today with specific recommendations on how to improve its privacy policy. https://t.co/vvWvwMa7kC
(4/5) Consumers deserve more control over personal info and have a right to clear, comprehensive info about how their data is being treated.
(3/5) While the update may provide some consumer benefits, I believe Uber's policy should reflect the justifications for the update.
(2/5) Uber has eliminated users' ability to allow the app to access their location only "while using the app." Now it's "always" or "never."
(1/5) If you frequently use ride-hailing app Uber, you probably noticed last month's major update regarding access to users' location data.
I'm urging #PEOTUS (w/ 19 other @SenateDems) to deliver on promise to bring down cost of Rx drugs for all Americans. https://t.co/ElgUmLpXKz

(1/2) Due to inclement weather, @fema Disaster Centers for those affected by the September flooding in MN will be closed until Monday.

(4/4) Today I pressed the Ed Dept. w/ my colleague @amyklobuchar to help current &amp; former Globe/MN Biz students access debt relief options.
(3/4) But now we need to help the students who were recruited fraudulently, misled about credits, and who were lied to about job prospects.
(2/4) And just last week, Dept. of Ed (@usedgov) cut off both schools from receiving federal education funds, which was the right move.
(1/4) Two for-profit schools in our state, Globe University and MN School of Business, have a terrible history of misleading students.
Great year for MN volleyball. @CSPBearsVB won 8th @NCAADII nat'l championship and @GopherVBall will compete in nat'l semifinals on Thursday.

Hubert Humphrey called Judge Miles Lord the "people's judge." He stood up to powerful interests even when it was hard or unpopular.

(2/4) I'm pleased that a large number of my commonsense health care priorities were included in #CuresAct and are now going to become law.
(1/4) The #CuresAct is compromise legislation that will help us make investments in the right areas of our health care system.

Today, I voiced concern over AT&amp;T’s proposed $85 billion merger w/ Time Warner, which could raise consumer costs. https://t.co/ejqfgtzQmk

Learn more about how #CJMHA will bolster access to mental health services for people in the criminal justice system. https://t.co/9mZLXzhGWh
And now, with #CJMHA set to become law, we can help local communities respond appropriately to a person with a mental health condition.
We’ve been using jails &amp; prisons as a substitute for a fully functioning mental health system. That's why I've been fighting for the #CJMHA.
US has 5% of world's population, but 25% of world's prison population. And that's in large part bc we've criminalized mental illness. #CJMHA
I'm pleased that my Comprehensive Justice and Mental Health Act (#CJMHA) passed as part of large legislative package in Congress.
For years, I’ve been pressing for national energy policies &amp; tax credits that help make projects like Jane’s 72-panel #solar array possible.

(4/5) We need to implement Leveling the Playing Field Act &amp; consider comprehensive factors in Commission's determination to provide relief.
(3/5) And as of last year, US producers were utilizing only 66% of their capacity, with US plate production falling by nearly 20% in 2015.
(2/5) In 2015, the domestic industry estimates that 1.2 million tons of unfairly traded imports, worth $850 million, entered the US market.
(1/5) I’m urging the U.S. Internat’l Trade Commission to provide American steel plate manufacturers relief from dumped &amp; subsidized imports.
Great to hear that Mike Zimmer is doing well, and that he'll be making his way down to Jacksonville for the upcoming game. #SKOL @Vikings.

(2/2) If @HouseGOP is serious about helping manufacturing in MN &amp; our nation, they (&amp; @SpeakerRyan) need to stop plans to scrap #BuyAmerica.
(1/2) Minnesotans on the Iron Range, and across our state, understand that US infrastructure should be built w/ US steel &amp; iron. #BuyAmerica

(4/4) This weekend, I’ll be visiting @SecondStork in St. Paul to see how our community can help families with essential items they need.
(3/4) I've championed Senate legislation to help families with newborns and toddlers in Minnesota and across the country afford diapers.
(2/4) In MN alone, this #diaperneed affects the health &amp; well-being of 75,000+ young children. I'm working w/ @keithellison to change that.
(1/4) Diaper costs for a single child run almost $1,000/year. That’s an expense that is simply unaffordable for many families in our nation.

I took to the Senate floor today with @SenJeffMerkley to urge my colleagues to keep fighting for the #OvertimeRule. https://t.co/zR28kkXuOD
It's December 1. @USDOL #OvertimeRule should have gone into effect today. Instead, American workers are being #Scrooged this holiday season.
I hope Donald Trump is serious about following through with campaign promises to help American workers. I hope he joins #OvertimeRule fight.
At a time when the median family still makes less than they did 16 years ago, we must do all we can to help American workers. #OvertimeRule
I joined my colleagues today with @EconomicPolicy, @NELPNews, &amp; @MomsRising in continuing to push for #OvertimeRule. https://t.co/4IEzy10hot
But as a result of a recent decision by a TX judge, the new #OvertimeRule is being put on ice. That's not the way to help American workers.
Today, Dec. 1, was supposed to be a good day for workers. Millions of Americans were going to receive OT benefits from @USDOL #OvertimeRule.
(2/2) Each and every day, I wake up and fight on behalf of MN, and I know Amy does too. Oh, and @amyklobuchar is #1! https://t.co/QWCJqxKRvs
(1/2) I'm proud that @amyklobuchar and I are two of the senators who have supported the most legislation to become law this congress.
Wishing Coach Mike Zimmer a quick recovery from his procedure. I'm sure we'll see you on the sidelines soon, and as always, #Skol @Vikings.

(3/4) I helped champion bipartisan #ECHOAct that would expand efforts to link primary care clinics with specialists via video conference.
(2/4) We need to make sure rural health providers can access specialized care through telemedicine when they need it in MN communities.
(1/4) As Co-Chair of bipartisan Senate Rural Health Caucus, I’m working to better equip #rural health providers with the tools they need.

We need our bill passed. We can’t leave infants and children without clean diapers. Families need help now. #DiaperNeed
And my Minnesota Congressional colleague @keithellison is pushing the same measure in the House of Representatives. #DiaperNeed
Diapers are essential to a baby’s health and to a family’s well-being. I have a bill w/ @SenBobCasey to ensure families can access diapers.
But that pales in comparison to the serious #DiaperNeed that families in Minnesota and across the country are facing right now.
It’s annoying to go to the store in the middle of the night when you’re out of diapers, the baby’s crying, and you’re an exhausted parent.
My office is hosting a tax seminar at @exploreCOCO tomorrow in Minneapolis, &amp; one of the last spots could be yours: https://t.co/JVgIMBo0xZ

That won’t do anything to help families scared about #ZikaVirus. Shame on the @SenateGOP for putting politics above doing the right thing.
Amid a public health crisis, Senate Rs want to defund women’s health, gut the ACA, and fly the Confederate flag on federal cemeteries.
But Senate Republicans seem to disagree. They jammed a bill to fund the fight against Zika with partisan, dangerous provisions.
The #ZikaVirus is a real threat—not a political talking point—and working to prevent and treat the disease should be bipartisan.
