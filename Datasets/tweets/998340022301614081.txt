@calebsmommy23 @jose3army @realDonaldTrump Certainly will share.
@DaddyDaddymac I have no problem with black repubs or white Dems or blue libertarians or red green party people.  It's the content of their character that matters.
@jose3army @realDonaldTrump Again, that has absolutely nothing to do with what I said.  Trump does not give a shit about troops or veterans.  If you have nothing else to add to this conversation except to bring up irrelevant news reports about Obama, then don't bother responding, troll.
@patriotmckenzie @strimai Crickets...she comes in, insults me and then runs away...sounds like a troll to me.

@jose3army @realDonaldTrump What in the hell does THAT have to do with my calling trump out on his bullshit?  Trump DOESN'T give a damn about our troops or our veterans.  I sure as hell didn't say anything about McCain in my response to him.
