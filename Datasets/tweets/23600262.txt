The Center for Effective Lawmaking just ranked my service as the most effective House Democrat last Congress. Imagine what we could accomplish with equal representation to other states! #DCStatehood	https://t.co/n6VxK1YuLe
Yesterday, my bill requiring the Library of Congress to install the DC seal in the Thomas Jefferson building passed the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.		DC should be equal in all respects with the states — that includes in the Library of Congress. #FreeAndEqualDC
Right now I’m leading a special hour on the House floor urging #DCStatehood. Yesterday, a record number of D.C. residents demanded Congress recognize their citizenship. 		Now, HR 51 (the D.C. Admission Act) has 198 cosponsors and we have strong momentum!
It is outrageous that only the President can grant clemency for local DC offenses.		DC writes its own laws and alone should grant clemency from those laws, like states and territories. My bill gives DC that authority. #FreeAndEqualDC
Breaking News: Historic vote on #DCStatehood next week. House expected to pass HR 1, the For The People Act of 2019, which endorses DC statehood. Neither chamber has ever voted to endorse DC statehood. The momentum is building for a floor vote on HR 51, my DC statehood bill.
Going on @AC360 at 8 tonight to talk about my committee’s hearing tomorrow with former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.  Cohen will tell us what we do not know about Trump actions that could have influenced campaign.
Success.  My bill to allow DC, @NatlParkService and private sector to work together to fund and rehabilitate NPS parks is headed to the President’s desk for signature, after the House passed it today.  Franklin Park will be up first.
Speaking on House floor shortly on lands package that will help us renovate our local @NatlParkService parks.
During #DCStatehood Week, we are proud we now have as many cosponsors on our statehood bill as there are Republicans in Congress: 197, or 87% of the House Democratic Caucus. More signing on daily. See my House Floor speech on statehood today: https://t.co/gES8SIlTbH
Pending #DCStatehood, we will fight for a #FreeAndEqualDC by all means necessary.  My bill to place DC’s seal alongside the state seals in the Library of Congress will be marked up tomorrow.
Thank you Maryland General Assembly Delegate Gabriel Acevero for your leadership in securing a hearing today on a resolution calling for #DCStatehood!
Expect final passage next week of my bill to allow DC and @NatlParkService to work together to fund and rehabilitate NPS parks in DC. Franklin Park will be first.
See my @washingtonpost letter to the editor responding to @ChuckLane1’s endorsement of retroceding DC to Maryland. My #DCStatehood bill, with a record 197 cosponsors, is the only way to make DC free and equal.  https://t.co/GxymofIQu9

Challenging Trump’s fake emergency as an original cosponsor of @JoaquinCastrotx’s resolution to terminate the emergency declaration for a border wall. This declaration is an abuse of power, violates democratic norms and is unlawful. Congress must stop Trump’s slide into tyranny.
School is out, DC kids, but my bill permitting sledding on that hill at the Capitol is still in. Enjoy!
On the cusp of getting a House floor vote on #DCStatehood, @ChuckLane1 endorses the old saw of retrocession to Maryland.  Double trouble: to win votes from Congress and from Maryland, where no officials endorse retrocession.  https://t.co/CsiCz0pqMg
Congress rejected the wall and Trump signed the bill. Trump’s trumped up emergency does not go around Congress. It goes around the Constitution. #stop Tfrump’s coup.
If Congress lets Trump call national emergencies when we won’t concede on issues like a wall, we should just hand him our vote cards and go home. #stopTrumptakeover
All workers harmed by the #TrumpShutdown deserve to be fully compensated. Trump’s intervention to block back pay for federal contract workers, despite bipartisan support, showed no regard for fairness. We must address back pay for federal contract workers.
No credit score penalty for #TrumpShutdown. I wrote credit reporting agencies urging they disregard missed payments by furloughed federal employees and contract workers due to the #Shutdown when calculating credit scores. https://t.co/xL3LNRmjYe
I supported the House vote this week to remove US troops from Yemen.  Yet DC had no vote on this matter of war and peace, even though DC residents fund, fight and die in wars.  DC deserves a vote on wars and all other matters.  My #DCStatehood bill would fix this injustice.
Good news for DC - Final FY 19 DC spending bill contains $40 million for DCTAG for the 4th consecutive year and no new anti-home-rule riders!  Now that we have a Democratic House, we will redouble our efforts to remove the remaining two riders in FY 20.

We hold public officials to a higher standard than ordinary citizens for a reason – they must have the confidence and trust of the people in order to effectively govern. Both Justin Fairfax and Ralph Northam have lost the ability to successfully govern and therefore must resign.
I introduced a bill to give DC's mayor local authority over DC's National Guard, the same authority enjoyed by governors of states and territories. DC's mayor has the best knowledge about when to deploy the Guard for local purposes. #FreeAndEqualDC https://t.co/Pm7mFhr1eE

#HappyNewYear! Can’t wait to make the most of a Democratic-controlled House and make 2019 the best year ever for #DCStatehood.
As we celebrate the beginning of a New Year tonight, we also rejoice in the start of a new Democratic-controlled Congress. 		And this Friday (1/4), at 11:30 am in 2154 Rayburn, I will host a press conference to announce my first bill of 2019: #HR51, our #DCstatehood bill! https://t.co/87ZpE5BtLI
I will introduce our #DCStatehood bill (H.R. 51) with a record number of original cosponsors when the new Congress starts next week! https://t.co/0Q2cfDeRvJ
Federal employees don’t work as “Democrats” or “Republicans,” but as civil servants serving our nation. Trump’s needless shutdown is hurting hundreds of  thousands of Americans and the hardworking federal employees who serve them. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/5o4iijBMuz
Federal employees don’t deserve this #TrumpShutdown, but be assured that some of us in Congress are already at work to make sure all our federal employees will be made whole with back pay.
#MerryChristmas DC! Wishing you and your family a peaceful and joy-filled day.🎄
Working to end the #TrumpShutdown, but DC remains open. I got a provision in last year’s federal spending bill that enables the DC government to spend its local budget at next year’s levels. Keeping DC from being held hostage by Trump and a dysfunctional Republican Congress.
Thank you to @RepLBR and @RepJudyChu for agreeing to introduce our #DCStatehood bill with me next Congress, bringing us to 147 original cosponsors!
Thank you @USRepKeating and @RepSusanWild for cosponsoring our #DCStatehood bill, and for committing to be original cosponsors next year! We are now up to 180 total cosponsors for the 115th Congress! https://t.co/6RmAgphhQX https://t.co/oGfjreKVYB
An absolute disgrace. I introduced a bill that would guarantee back pay to federally-contracted retail, food, custodial and security service workers furloughed during a #TrumpShutdown.

Democrats turn out in presidential elections but often lose midterms because of low turnout. This year’s 38-seat (so far) win defied both midterm history and iron-fisted Republican gerrymandering.
Have you noticed? The Members who say they won’t vote for Nancy Pelosi for speaker give no reasons why based on her service and leadership. That’s because there are none.

4/ If the Trump Administration chooses to move forward, they will have to deal with me, my colleagues in Congress, and, I believe, the courts, to justify these proposals.
3/ Security concerns cited by NPS do not hold water considering the newly enhanced White House fence, which I specifically worked on here in Congress, both to protect the White House and to ensure that public access to the White House sidewalk would be maintained.
2/ This is the nation’s capital, the seat of our national democratic government and, consequently, where First Amendment rights are most often exercised on virtually every issue by Americans of all colors, creeds, and beliefs.

It took work to get a congressional agreement to reverse Trump’s cancellation of a scheduled pay increase to federal workers. We will get beyond these token pay raises for our much-deprived civil servants when there is a change in control of Congress. https://t.co/RCTch9wEtw
Our Champion @Capitals have started the 2018-19 season right where they left off. After raising the Stanley Cup banner, they laid the hammer down on the Bruins with a 7-0 rout. DC’s ready to do it again. #ALLCAPS https://t.co/PKTD56OJM5
First Trump praised Dr. Ford as “very credible,” then stooped low to insult her. No surprise that Trump, who made fun of a disabled reporter as a candidate, would bring mean, belittling into the American presidency for the first time. https://t.co/dwD9Uyb8jS
Positive responses from my colleagues encourage me to get even more Democrats on our #DCStatehood bill before adjournment. DC residents can help too. 		Statehood would fix one of this country’s original sins: Denying taxpaying DC residents equal voting rights and self-government. https://t.co/1QmKpAeyrr

Heading for a new Kavanaugh FBI investigation controversy. Not enough to check the “done that” box after this week’s investigation. No plan for what to do with the report? No hearing with witnesses based on the findings? No publication of the report? Here we go again. #NoCoverUp

Finally, recognition that a circumscribed FBI investigation is no investigation at all. The FBI must be free to follow leads opened by info from witnesses and new info from its own or unsolicited sources. New info often leads to best intel. https://t.co/kAbXsNkZ5p

I’ll be on @CNN at 11:30am to discuss how putting limits on the FBI’s Kavanaugh investigation will look like a cover-up. Let the facts come forward.
The week allowed for the Kavanaugh FBI investigation will require a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to call witnesses to be examined based on the FBI’s findings. There is no avoiding this next step.

Dr. Ford has requested the usual FBI investigation. Judge Kavanaugh has not. Dr. Ford has taken a polygraph test. Judge Kavanaugh has not.		Draw your own conclusions about who is telling the truth regarding the alleged sexual assault.
It’s essential that Dr. Ford be allowed to continue to negotiate for a fair hearing, especially since she’s being denied the token FBI investigation Anita Hill got. A take it or leave it—Ford vs. the nation’s most powerful—is an insult not only to her but to all women.

I’ll be with @andersoncooper on @ac360 tonight at 8pm. Republicans are orchestrating their own delay by not authorizing the standard FBI investigation now. Dr. Ford’s call for regular order before appearing at any hearing is a request for equal treatment with past witnesses.

I remind my colleagues of DC’s Aaa bond rating, recently awarded for the District’s "exemplary fiscal governance." At a minimum, Republicans should recognize DC budget autonomy, which is now law, and allow DC to spend its locally-raised funds how it sees fit. #HandsOffDC

When I chaired the EEOC, we defined sexual harassment for the first time as workplace discrimination and required private employers to take steps to eliminate it. It’s time for Congress to catch up.
Sexual harassment training educates workers and employers about unwelcome advances. My staff and I have completed the training, and I wrote my colleague urging they do the same even before it becomes mandatory. #ThisWeek https://t.co/FqK1YdtLIr

7/ Repeal of DC budget autonomy referendum is not only bad policy; it violates one of our nation's most revered principles—local control.
6/ DC’s budget is bigger than the budgets of 14 states.  The District raises $8 billion in local funds.
5/ Budget autonomy has benefits for DC: lower borrowing costs, more accurate revenue and expenditure forecasts, &amp; improved agency operations
4/ Congress loses nothing under budget autonomy. Congress retains authority to legislate on any DC matter, including its local budget.
3/ Astonishing Repubs are so opposed to a local jurisdiction spending its local funds w/out the approval of a federal body, the US Congress.
2/ DC’s Local Budget Autonomy Act allows D.C. to spend its local funds, raised solely in DC, after a 30-day congressional review period

@USRepGaryPalmer 3/ Only DC elected officials should be making decisions on the local matters affecting nearly 700,000 DC residents #HandsOffDC

At @GOPOversight #Clinton hearing, I'm asking FBI Director Comey about security risk of Members of Congress who use private email addresses.
The repeal of DC budget autonomy referendum is not only bad policy; it is a blight on this country’s most revered principle—local control.
Budget autonomy has practical benefits for DC: lower borrowing costs, improved agency operations, &amp; removal of DC government shutdown threat
Local control over locally-raised funds is a principle much-cited by Republicans, and is central to the American form of government.
Budget autonomy = modest attempt by DC to implement its budget soon after it is passed, like all other jurisdictions. BA is not statehood.
Congress loses nothing under budget autonomy. It retains authority to legislate on any DC matter, including its local budget, at any time.
Budget autonomy is law of the land: DC Superior Court upheld it, no appeal was filed, and the court ordered DC employees to implement it.

Budget autonomy is the law of the land with a court order behind it. DC officials have no alternative. https://t.co/dn67q5b7R5
Budget autonomy would lower DC's borrowing costs on Wall Street, improve agency operations, and remove the threat of government shutdowns.
DC’s budget is bigger than those of 14 states. It raises more than $7 billion in local funds. DC contributes more fed taxes than 22 states.
Congress can even abolish the District of Columbia government. Is that enough “complete authority” for you?
House GOP budget says: “We are humble enough to admit that the federal government does not have all the answers.” Let DC feel your humility.
