@nullriver Stop
@aesign_ Top tweaks... kind of like the apple App Store but not as terribly executed as the App Store
@Pwn20wnd This might resurrect the jailbreaking community...
@Pwn20wnd I mean it’s true though...
@3BzU_ @coolstarorg Yes
@Pwn20wnd Unteather😂
@vincentdjga @Andywiik @LaughingQuoll Broke ass
@coolstarorg Wow nice job! Quick question: can I download it even though I’m already jailbroken on 11.3.1? (Delete current version of electra, download new version, and not have to re-jailbreak?
@c0linbard @coolstarorg Get out of here, cunt... you don’t deserve it
@coolstarorg Thank you for the hard work! It works great so far... prob the best since 9.3.3 👍🏻
@ZeSteRyy @Pwn20wnd same
@Pwn20wnd cydia is there, but it crashes when I open it. when I go to the electra app, it says "enable jailbreak", and upon clicking it, my phone reboots on 1/3.
@Pwn20wnd It says enable jailbreak, and crashes at 1/3. what do I do?
@coolstarorg It’s happening today???
@Pwn20wnd I really hope you guys burn the 0day...it would allow for a long lasting, stable jaklbreak- and why even risk waiting if it could potentially be patched? I mean then all of it would be for nothing.
@coolstarorg @electra_team Thank god!
@coolstarorg @_niklasb No, just release!
@Pwn20wnd What...
@i41nbeer Thank you!!!
@coolstarorg This is still with a dev account though, right?
@coolstarorg Thank god
@coolstarorg Why not work on the other one?? :’(
