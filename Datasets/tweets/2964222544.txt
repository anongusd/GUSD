This is not a hearing about privatizing Nevada public lands. #NV04
The purpose of today’s @NatResources hearing is to improve federal land management to better serve #LasVegas.
Hardy:It’s important we hold this hearing in @CNLV, a community that may not be as familiar w/how they're impacted by land mngmnt decisions.
Hardy: It’s also an issue that people feel very strongly about, often leading to intense debates and differences of opinion.
Hardy: In a state w/ more than 85% of its land under fed control, land mngmnt is a critical issue that affects every Nevadan.

Nevadans don’t want more regulations, they want more #jobs.
Instead of ending too-big to fail, regulators inserted it into law.
Dodd-Frank in essence is top-down governance from Washington Bureaucrats.
These community banks were not the banks making risky loans, they were building strong relationships with their customers.
These small community banks serve my constituents. They serve the neighborhoods in my district.
One size-fits all rules have impacted small bankers so much that we have less community banks now than we had before Dodd-Frank.
They are being suffocated by the 400 new federal regulations.
Not surprisingly, Dodd-Frank took a big swing at our community banks as well.
Half of all people employed in this country work for small businesses.
The life blood of our nation lies with small businesses.
Think about that – we have more small business “deaths” than small business “births.”
We have, for the first time in over three decades, more small businesses failing than being started.
Five years in, what do we have today?
This week marks the fifth anniversary of the signing of a law that was the Democratic answer to the recession that impacted our nation.

We need local input, we need votes in Congress, and we need to fix the #AntiquatedAntiquitiesAct.
I’m confident Dems and Republicans can work together to protect America’s natural heritage while also preserving its people’s way of life.
They live on in today’s generations who continue to carry on traditions and respect the lands they call home.
Rural Nevada’s culture, the will and resolve of its people, are not things that can be locked away in an outdoor museum.
At the end of the day, there is no doubt in my mind that the #AntiquitiesAct is a holdover of a bygone era.
#AntiquitiesAct is antiquated. It is a law rooted in the last century, and has been manipulated over the years to exceed its original intent
I wholeheartedly agree that we have a responsibility – we must protect what needs to be protected.
#Nevadans refuse to be lectured by those who feel they are first among equals in matters concerning our home.
Southeastern rural Nevada is in my blood. #NV04
Some wish to paint those who oppose this designation as enemies of our public lands, when nothing could be further from the truth.
I stand here again today to give a voice to what Nevada’s argument is, and what Nevada’s argument is not.

NEW this morning - @reviewjournal editors agree: No new monument without congressional approval, federal land release http://t.co/pxQIrWq3c8
Looking forward to voting on #FY16NDAA this morning. With @NellisAFB in #NV04, I know importance of this amendment: https://t.co/PXs5HsBAt7

Important: #TuleSprings was "created through Congress, w/ local consultation &amp; bipartisan support" - http://t.co/pxQIrWq3c8 #BasinandRange
#HR488, supported by myself, @SenDeanHeller, @MarkAmodeiNV2, @RepJoeHeck, is "sound" policy, says @reviewjournal: http://t.co/pxQIrWq3c8
