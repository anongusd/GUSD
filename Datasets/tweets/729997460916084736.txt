@RepMattGaetz .	.	I hate a whiner,  especially when they are just a drunk.		Quit whining and do something productive. 		Oh, wait, you only know how to whine, you don't know how to do anything productive.		Let's drink to that. https://t.co/HHrpllIOzp
@tedcruz .	.	You are the biggest fool, no the second biggest fool on earth. Only one bigger fool, and he's in the White House.
@MSNBC .	.	Someone in his position that wasn't 150 pounds overweight and that was high energy might have attacked the investigation on their illegal deeds 5,000 times. 		Thank God he's a lazy fat arse.
@RepMattGaetz @FoxNews .	.	You are a raging loudmouthed drunk.		Maga, resign and move in with your friend Putin.
@tedcruz .	.	Hey moron, screw your wall, let's lower my taxes like you did for your rich friend's.
@RepRonEstes @realDonaldTrump .	.	FFUU until you see double.
@RepMattGaetz .	.	Your a real piece of human garbage.
@marcorubio @POTUS .	.	F you and F Trump, and F the whore you both road to Washington.
@senatemajldr @POTUS .	.	Kiss off turtle. Do your f'ing job and put through a bill that the House will pass. F Trump.
@realDonaldTrump .	.	You're petrified of Rush, that's a lot worse.		Besides, you're going to want liberals in power when you go to prison, so you'll be treated humanely.
@marcorubio .	.	Just another Republican fake CHRISTIAN!		Can't stand these spineless liars.
@RepRWilliams @HouseGOP @POTUS No wall! Nothing to say. 		NBC reported with 10,000 people, only 230 miles could be completed by the time Trump theoretically will leave office (I  assume he will be in prison before then).		Also, they were able to cut through Trump's slats with a hack saw. Fake security.
@MikeKellyPA .		You're a sick piece of GOP garbage. 	Open the government,  quit the bs.
@CongressmanHice @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @POTUS @realDonaldTrump .	.	You're a moron, open the government,  we don't need a useless wall Trump wants to put his name on. 		Noticed he didn't try so hard when the GOP controlled both houses?		Pelosi has made Trump Schumer's bitch.		Ha, ha, ha!!!!!
@RepByrne @POTUS ..		Eat a wet brownie. 		Your a Russian operative.
@Franklin_Graham .	.	Too many GOP fake Christians in the government. And too make fake Christians supporting them, that's why God I'd pissed.
@RepRWilliams @POTUS .	.	Listen you GOP piece of lying crap. Just let your unindicted felon president declare a national emergency and use DOD money to build his useless wall and then open up the government. 		You're a moron.
@VP @POTUS .	.	You belong in prison with the orange dotard.
@HouseGOP .	.	Crap, what about the insane reckless GOP agenda?		Thanks for the recession,  the ballooning deficit, and the crazy idiot in the oval office. 		You all must be working for Putin.
@RepByrne .	.	You're just running up the deficit you lying piece of GOP garbage.
@RepRWilliams @GOPLeader .	.	How much are the Russians paying you, you FAKE AMERICAN!
@RepThomasMassie .	.	How about letting the Controllers Office audit the federal government first, you moron.
@RepTrentKelly .	.	You're a sick piece of GOP garbage.

@RepKevinBrady .	.	Moron! You must peeeeee in the wind too.
@RepMattGaetz .	.	Will he lock up drunk drivers, like they are suppose to be?
@realDonaldTrump .	.	Obama was a better president and a better person. You're finished in 2020 if they don't lock you and your family up first.
@realDonaldTrump .	.	Prison awaits you orange dotard.
@RepMattGaetz .	.	How did a dumb piece of crap like you get reelected?		Your constituents be drunks too.
@RandPaul .	.	Hey moron is Trump going to kill himself if he doesn't get the wall? https://t.co/iaBy8bSYja
@RepMattGaetz @POTUS .	.	You're a moron if you think the government can spend $5 Billion and have a secure border.	 	Why don't you just crawl back to Russia and kiss Putin's azzz.
@RepJasonSmith .	.	I think we got that $700 billion back plus. The wall is just flushing money down the toilet. Something the GOP seems fond of these days.		What happen to getting the Mexicans to pay? Just another GOP lie.
@tedcruz .	.	You'll never be president.
@marcorubio .	.	You keep spewing this crap and refuse to do your job. You're a fake CHRISTIAN,  do your job. Jesus even thinks you're a moron.
@RepByrne .	.	Nah, you're the moron. Your position is indefensible.  You're not going to get the wall the Mexicans were supposed to pay for as promised by Trump.		You going to send Trump commissary money when he goes to prison?
@RepFrenchHill .	.	You shouldn't be paid anything. You don't represent your constituents.
@RepJeffDuncan .	.	Hey jerk. How about people that believe in spending money wisely,  not blowing it on a fence that won't stop anyone.
@RepHuizenga .	.	Why didn't you just pass the Senate bill and end the insanity. A decade-long rally on Wall Street looks like it's ending and you are playing games for the idiot in the White House.  You're a moron.
@RepMcSally .	.	Don't worry,  Trump didn't want his advice anyway.		A decade-long rally on Wall Street looks like it's ending, thank you GOP,  I'm sure you'll blame Obama.
@replouiegohmert .	.	Did God tell you to do this?		A decade-long rally on Wall Street looks like it's ending and you're wanting more regulations,  not less.		You pick and choose your regulations, if they pollute or allow for nuts to carry guns, then they are okay. 		Rot in ..
@RepRonEstes .	.	Your a moron, just like Trump.  A decade-long rally on Wall Street looks like it's ending and you're worried about a f'ing wall that will do nothing.
@RepRWilliams @POTUS .	.	A decade-long rally on Wall Street looks like it's ending, your GOP recession is coming, and it will be HUGE!
@RepMattGaetz @POTUS @FoxNews @seanhannity .	.	A decade-long rally on Wall Street looks like it's ending... thank you GOP!		Get ready for a Trump style recession,  it will be HUGE!
@RepMattGaetz .	.	Hey drunk moron, ask the sob Rosenstein. Call him up and ask him and quit the f'ing drama.		Trump is headed to prison,  you should be too.
@RepSeanDuffy .	.	I don't have a border, so I guess I don't have a country?		How come the GOP is nothing but misogynistic,  racist, bigots that thrive on fear and hate?		You guys suck, and your leader is going to prison for the rest of his life - where he belongs.
@RepMattGaetz .	.	Why didn't you go to prison for your DWI's?		It's a rigged system, and you're government scum that complains a lot. 		But it is us, the public, that goes to your prisons you corrupt piece of garbage.
@RepChrisCollins .	.	Yet you're a trumppuppet?		Typical politician,  you'll say anything and stand for nothing.
@WarrenDavidson @realDonaldTrump .	.	Okay, as long as there is no tax credit or deduction for their contribution to the wall.		I'd like a fence in my backyard, think the neighborhood will contribute?		Not likely,  just like it is not likely 60 million people are going to donate $50.		You people are crazy.
@SpeakerRyan .	.	Don't pick his pockets after hours you crook.
@marcorubio .	.	Fake CHRISTIAN. Fake American.  Fake Senator. 		And he lies too!
@replouiegohmert @seanhannity .	.	Fake CHRISTIAN. 		Please, don't believe a word this man says, only Trump lies more.
@replouiegohmert .	.	Would Jesus want a boarder wall, or the money spent on the poor and needy?		Guess you've shown that you're just another FAKE CHRISTIAN!		Resign you piece of garbage.
@replouiegohmert .	.	And the woman were trimming their wicks....		FAKE CHRISTIAN!		You don't vote like Jesus, but like Satin.
@realDonaldTrFan .	.	Have you picked the federal prison your going to pass in yet.		That will make America great again.
@marcorubio .	.	Time to lock up the Trump's and VP Pence for abuse of power and conspiracy.
@VP @Space_Station .	.	Need to lock up the Trump's,  and their toady vp.
@RepMattGaetz @RonDeSantisFL .	.	Time to start locking up Republicans,  not just the drunks. The drunks should be locked up too.		I'm sure you agree.
@RepMattGaetz @marthamaccallum @FoxNews .	.	So what you are saying is that your election was a fraud.		You should just report to federal prison, no need for a trial.
@replouiegohmert .	.	I checked with Jesus,  and he is okay with it Louie. He said you're just crazy as a junk yard dog. 		FAKE CHRISTIAN!
@marcorubio .	.	Marco, what are you going to say about the horrible Republican recession that is just around the corner? 		You gonna blame a federal judge, the Democrats,  France?		I'm sure it won't be your fault you little lying weasel.
@senatemajldr .	.	You belong in prison,  not the Senate.		Resign moron.
@VP @moonriver365 .	.	Hey toady, do you think he will write you when you are in prison?		Just remembering Agnew.
@KenCalvert .	.	Wasn't he the sicko that bragged they investigate Hillary for political reasons,  not because she did anything. 		Well good luck with just another GOP moron nut.
@NatResources @replouiegohmert .	.	What would Jesus say?		Probably you're crazy and are destined for a hot spot for all eternity.
@senatemajldr .	.	The class of gridlock. 		All are welcome.
@tedcruz .	.	It's all those damn Canadians that are destroying the Texas culture. They should be forced to live in Detroit.
@RepMattGaetz @LouDobbs .	.	A paranoid mental case like you needs to be instutionalized, not serving in Congress. Guess now that you will be a powerless blow hard, what you say won't matter to any except your psychiatrist.
@realDonaldTrump .	.	Get your tax return ready for us to see.		You can post it on a tweet on your way to prison.
@RepGosar .	.	Hey moron, wouldn't it be the CIA that would have that information?		You must be from Kenya.
@marcorubio .	.	And NO HEALTHCARE!		You're a pig.
@marcorubio .	.	The 3 pts. kick is a dog whistle for morons, the only people that give a crap about what you have to say.
@realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA .	.	Move on, the votes still need to be counted to determine the winner.		I want you vote, is it too late?
@realDonaldTrump .	.	It's your job to make Putin apologize. If you can't do it maybe we need to bring back that black president from Kenya.
@RepMcCaul .	.	The midterms are over moron,  you can knock off the bologna.
@marcorubio .	.	What would Jesus say?		He'd probably hate Republicans.
@IvankaTrump .	.	Time to lock up all the Trump's before they destroy America. 		Thieves and crooks, con artists - everyone of them.
@RepByrne @vetsrecover .	.	Will you protect pre-existing conditions for everyone?		I doubt it.
@VP @POTUS .	.	Trump and Pence are lying unethical traitors that need to be locked up forever.
@MittRomney .	.	I'm guessing you'll be kissing Trump's butt before Christmas. 		No Republican has any balls, Trump keeps them in his top desk drawer.
@VP @POTUS .	.	You must be drunk, you lost the House you idiot. And 7 governorships. 		You're just a toady of a tiny liar. 		Grow a pair.
@RepMattGaetz .	.	Great, I'm sure you won't complain about the subpoena  for Trump's tax return. Aren't you curious?

@tedcruz .	.	If I were you I'd check Trump's top desk drawer for your balls, they seem to have gone missing.
@BreitbartNews .	.	He's a shameless liar. Others would have been better without having to lie about their wild antics.
@marcorubio .	.	So jerk, why did you vote for another sexual predator?		Trump must have your balls in his desk drawer.		Shame, you'll never be president!
@realDonaldTrump .	.	Devils triangle.  Your style baby!
@tedcruz .	.	I'll volunteer to drive you Back to Canada and leave you at the boarder where you belong. 		Hopefully,  they will put you in a chain link fence cage inside a vacant Walmart.  Same way you treat others
@marcorubio .	.	Maybe because of robots like you.		You do what Trump and Mitch tell you to do.		Grow a pair teddy bear.
@VP .	.	Devils Triangle,  do you know about these things?
@cathymcmorris .	The GOP wants to put an alleged rapist on the Supreme Court, money can't buy happiness, or whatever lies you're peddling.
@marcorubio .	.	What does this have to do with you being a Senator of the USA?		Are you auditioning for a minister job when you don't get reelected?
@RepMattGaetz .	.	.	A drunken stooper again,  get to rehab dude. Fix your head.
@RepMattGaetz .	.	Please don't drink in front of the kids.

@tedcruz .	.	Go back to Canada you foreign agent.
@cathymcmorris .	.	You need to be thanking Obama, not Trump. His policies will eventually destroy the economy. Quit lying!
@CBSNews .	.	Coming from a sexual predator that grabs woman by the p.
@marcorubio .	.	Mouth of a fool, like when you took on Trump in the debates. Showed you for a FOOL,  hey.		Resign you crazy GOP piece of garbage.
@realDonaldTrump .	.	You'll be in prison soon, hope you have adequate commissary money.
@marcorubio .	.	.	Are you making fun of Trump?		You're an idiot, trumppuppet. Trump thinks you're just another lying, short, dumb Southerner.
@marcorubio .	.	Resign trumppuppet,  Trump thinks you're just a another short dumb Southerner.
@RepJohnFaso .	.	You're a moron,  it's because of the aging population and the fall in population in the U.S.,  except for immigration. You're an idiot that knows nothing but what the GOP tells you.

@SenTedCruz @senjudiciary .	.	GO BACK TO CANADA YOU lying GOP piece of crap.
@RepSeanDuffy .	.	You're just another lying GOP piece of crap. 		Resign.
@RepHartzler @POTUS .	.	You wouldn't take any of these jobs you arrogant GOP piece of crap. 		You take any of these job and live off the pay and see how happy you are. 		No healthcare either. You should be in prison with Trump.
@cathymcmorris .	.	Keep promoting the GOP lies. Hopefully you'll be gone in January.
@marcorubio .	.	It's outrageous that you are a member of the U.S. Senate.
@RepMattGaetz .	.	What, no Hillary lock her up swag?		Matty, are you drinking again?		I know that is a ridiculous question.
@replouiegohmert @DailyCaller .	.	Nothin worse than a FAKE Christian with an opinion. The GOP is full of them.
@tedcruz .	.	You're so Canadian.
@tedcruz .	.	Hey, Teddy, how do you know so much about liberals?		You must be one of those Canadian liberals. 		GO BACK TO CANADA YOU FOOL!
@marcorubio @realDonaldTrump .	.	Trumppuppet,  how is that working out? $12 billion to corporate farmers, just another GOP scam.
@SpeakerRyan .	.	Guess you and Trump get to whizz on his grave you unpatriotic GOP piece of crap.
@marcorubio .	.	You're insane. Resign you crazy GOP sleazy trumppuppet.
@RepMattGaetz .	.	Drinking AGAIN?		How about investigating GW Bush and his lies to start the Iraq war that kill hundreds of thousands?		What no balls? 		Drink a little more and grow a pair.
@RepMoBrooks .	Mo, you're an idiot.  The GOP controls the government,  this all happened on YOUR WATCH!		SO WHY ARE YOU COMPLAINING?		JUST TRYING TO STIR UP THE IDIOTS THAT VOTE FOR YOU!		YOU'RE SHAMELESS!
@realDonaldTrump .	.	So Trumpazz,  have you picked a federal prison where you can spend the rest of your life with your boys and your son in law?
@RepRWilliams @TerryBlacksBBQ .	.	Looking at the pics, where are the illegal aliens that are suppose to be everywhere in Texas?
@tedcruz .	.	Teddy, are you a Russian operative too?		Take a knee dude, respect human rights.
@VP .	.	Perhaps the first Federal prison on the moon can be occupied by you and your buddy Trump?
@Jim_Jordan .	Trump lies about payoffs to hookers and about Russia. Let's get to the real answer and you neef to quit lying about the Dossier.
@tedcruz .	.	GO BACK TO CANADA YOU FOOL. You'll never be President and won't be a Senator much longer.
@SpeakerRyan .	.	Trumppuppet,  your boss says he's not a hero. Makes you look like a disgusting fool.
@marcorubio .	.	Simple solution, legalize drugs. End of issue.
@RepMattGaetz .	.	You obviously drunk, AGAIN!		What's going on with the Hillary investigation?
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS .	.	Better hurry, the Trump dude may not be POTUS much longer.
@SpeakerRyan Deficit is headed for the moon, inflation is coming, the bubble on the stock market is about to burst - this will certainly wipe out Obama's  progress that you claim for the GOP.   		You're a moron.
@RepBrianMast .	Good luck with that, your party will do nothing to help ypu.
@SteveScalise .	.	You're a moron, nothing will change that.
@RepMattGaetz .	.	Coming from a drunk that spent most of the last two years complaining about Bengazi.  You're a sick piece of GOP garbage.
@SteveScalise @RepClayHiggins .	.	You're a moron. Take away the guns and quit complaining.
@replouiegohmert @wmalnews .	.	You're GOP garbage. You belong in prison.
@RepMattGaetz .	.	You need to quit showing up to work drunk!
@marcorubio .	.	Very tired of fake Christian politicians that kidnap babies, suck up to our enemies, insult our allies, and destroy our human rights. You'll never be president. Resign, make America great again.
@replouiegohmert @Jim_Jordan .	.	I support the lying FBI agent over a crooked politician. Problem is, you both need to be behind bars.		How's your boss Putin doing?
@SteveScalise .	.	Not shameful. Shameful is that you are supporting a lying crook that's going to end up in prison.		Guess you're not playing with a full deck?
@RepLouBarletta You worry about puppies but don't lift a finger for children kidnapped by the GOP and kept in cages, forced to sleep on concrete floors. 		Why do dogs have greater rights than humans in your mind?
@RepDeSantis Time to start locking up Russian operatives that pretend to be loyal Americans.  The GOP is full of them, look in the mirror.
@marcorubio You're just another Russian loving GOP piece of garbage. Shut up!
@RepMattGaetz Quit showing up to work drunk. You need to focus on Hillary.  Right! It was her!
@marcorubio Trump made the decision moron.
@SpeakerRyan Good time to find a new job, resign now.
@RepErikPaulsen Good, you'll be able to find a job in January, Wal-Mart is hiring - toilets need to be cleaned and you are the man for the job.
@RepMattGaetz Are you drinking again, what about Hillary, stay focused moron.
@marcorubio I am refusing to serve Republicans in my business, sue me.
@RepDLamborn You're a bigoted piece of crap. You don't belong in Congress, go live in Russia with those of like minds, and take the orange dotard with you.
@BillOReilly Why don't you just bend over and take it with Trump, I think you both enjoy what Mueller is doing to you. Don't cry, the pain won't last long after he is finished.
@marcorubio Time to start locking up Republicans/Fake Christians and through away the key. Definitely mentally ill.
@SteveScalise A little over 2% annualized growth  last month, you're full of crap, the deficit is going to go through the roof with your insane tax cuts. You're as crazy as they come.
@SenateMajLdr Don't you really have a bad taste in your mouth? Must be tough to swallow.
@VP @SecondLady @POTUS @FLOTUS @AbeShinzo .	.	Off to kiss up to the guy you will go to prison for, sad!
@VP .	.	.	Why aren't you and Trump in prison? Is there no justice in America anymore?
@VP @POTUS .	.	Why aren't you and Trump in prison yet, is there no justice in America anymore?

@SpeakerRyan Vote trolling GOP piece of crap you are!
@SteveScalise The GOP is destroying America.  You're a bitch for the NRA.  A very disgusting person that belongs in prison with your buddy Trump.

@marcorubio Hey Marco,  how does it feel to be a bitch of the NRA?
@cathymcmorris The GOP refuses to use common sense in ending the violence, but instead asks adolescents for ways to solve the problem. I know they are wiser and more honest than anyone in the GOP. America is not safe with the NRA whores of the GOP running this country.  Shame!
@marcorubio @CNN Marco, you're just an NRA whore.
@marcorubio Kind of like a stupid ass like you thinking you could be president!		DO YOU WEAR NRA UNDERWEAR?

@RepLouBarletta @Dea I thought you Republicans hated law enforcement. Better not letTrump see your tweet.
@cathymcmorris @NRO Nobody trusts you because you lie about everything and spew GOP lies and propaganda.  What haven't you lied about or spun lately? Start telling the truth, like the tax cut was to benefit your donors, not constituents.
@RepMattGaetz Don't forget to blame Hillary.  If you show up sober, make sure you show your constituents you can drive and not get arrested.

@SteveScalise American families should be getting much more than $1000 to make up for the run away inflation the GOP is in the process of creating that will wipe out the $1000.
