@HardcoreLiberal @worldtosing @imbackagain45 I'm talking small business. Majority of business is small business who are conservatives
@HardcoreLiberal @worldtosing @imbackagain45 so you hate 99% of a 1 billion population religion?
@worldtosing @imbackagain45 @HardcoreLiberal majority of business owners are conservative. I beg to differ.
@HardcoreLiberal @worldtosing @imbackagain45 so. Doesn't mean you're allowed to hate Muslims.

@Blue_eyessmove @AliciaEtler moral of the story, don't act like a thug in a park.
@Blue_eyessmove @AliciaEtler PROBABLY. Cops will not wait around to find out.
@Blue_eyessmove @AliciaEtler he 100% aimed it before the police showed up. Which is what got the cops called.
@Resistance2020 Trump won 3084 counties. Hillary won 57. The democrats are damn near over with.
@Resistance2020 this article also states Hillary won less than 500 counties. Hillary won less than 100 counties. 57/3141 to be exact.
@Resistance2020 no shit the weaker counties are voting for the candidate for change...
@AliciaEtler @Blue_eyessmove my point is: I'm debating with an IT. #wasteoftime
@AliciaEtler @Blue_eyessmove its ILLEGAL to make a real gun look fake. Keep up.
@Blue_eyessmove @AliciaEtler not if you have reports of it being aimed.
@AliciaEtler @Blue_eyessmove u can't even decide what gender you are, let alone what a fake/real pistol is...
@AliciaEtler @Blue_eyessmove that's illegal as well.
@AliciaEtler @Blue_eyessmove the kid was in a PUBLIC park with an illegal weapon. There's no question about it.
@AliciaEtler @Blue_eyessmove he protected others by disabling the subject.
@Blue_eyessmove @AliciaEtler he was pacing like he was hard as fuck with that fake pistol
@Blue_eyessmove @AliciaEtler or if u can't understand life or death scenarios. Like holding/aiming an illegal pistol in a park.
@AliciaEtler @Blue_eyessmove the orange tip is a legal requirement
@AliciaEtler @Blue_eyessmove if I paint an orange tip on my fake gun black, it's an illegal weapon.
@Blue_eyessmove @AliciaEtler because the vast majority of our country are white men. Cops kill more whites than blacks as well.
@AliciaEtler @Blue_eyessmove wow. Your logic is so flawed.
@AliciaEtler @Blue_eyessmove there's no de-escalation in that close proximity.
@AliciaEtler @Blue_eyessmove an illegal fake pistol, you die. #naturalselection

@AliciaEtler @Blue_eyessmove there's no time to "verify" while the suspect has a weapon. How do you expect them to verify if it's real
@SarahKSilverman @EricTrump  Sarah, why are you even relevant? You supporter Hillary, you're irrelevant. #CelebsNeedToButtOut
@AliciaEtler @Blue_eyessmove the key word is COULD. Do you think they're gonna risk it? Hell no. Any gun COULD be a fake gun.
@Blue_eyessmove @tariqnasheed @Rickcru21235386 @AliciaEtler this is natural selection. U wanna walk around like a thug? U die
@Blue_eyessmove @tariqnasheed @Rickcru21235386 @AliciaEtler the cops didn't have time to tell him to drop the weapon.

@ryanenisband @SFGate the key word is COULD
@Gr8SageEqlofHvn actually, Crimea voted to become part of Russia
@LysergicCitizen @latimes so u have no facts for 2 million? Didn't think so
@LysergicCitizen @latimes millions? Try half a million
@nypost @tedcruz father, maybe?
@e_nandes2 of course, I voted for trump I must hate everything not male and white.
@DrGreyMatter well, Trump has opposite views than the judge on immigration. Do you not think that's a conflict of interest?
@ryanenisband show me where she won by 2 million https://t.co/qeQp63de58
@DrGreyMatter @ryanenisband @GroupAnon  2 million? That's so untrue
@DrGreyMatter la Raza means "the race". La Raza has opposed immigration laws, which is really the basis on which it's formed.
@ryanenisband @GroupAnon luckily, the majority of Americans didn't vote for someone other than Trump.
@MSignorile so you don't agree our professors should stop teaching liberalism and let our students decide on their own which fits best?
@kms_sf no shit it's incorrect. But that's how the left treats it. I don't see your view so I must be a racist, right?
@GOP_U LMFAOOOOOO too funny
@GOP_U #prettylittlesnowflake
@GobbleMFC @MSignorile most colleges teach liberalism. They form students into liberals, because the teachers are liberals. It's a sad thing
@kms_sf everyones a racist if you don't see eye to eye.
@DrGreyMatter now you're deflecting. If you knew what La Raza is, you wouldn't wonder why trump doesn't want that judge.
@SeeScottJump i was being sarcastic. The left loves to say the right hates everything.
@GobbleMFC @MSignorile liberalism is a disorder. #sorrynotsorry
