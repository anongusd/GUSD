Seeking justice amidst broken, impoverished and corrupt systems of the developing world requires a quality of devoted love.
Nothing is more urgent, nothing more brutal than violence against the poor. #ENDViolence #LocustEffect
Decide if justice is worthy. Are those we‚Äôre fighting for worthy? And then refuse to go away. #justice
Generosity is at war in the world against aggressive human cruelty and oppression, and it is, for us, an invitation to greatness.
Justice is not a side issue...but an aspect of God's core character that‚Äôs so crucial that it deserves our undivided attention. #justice
Fighting slavery only succeeds when those who are free + powerful share their freedom + power with those who are weakest &amp; in slavery.
There is no doubt that slavery is going into the dustbin of history ‚Äì it‚Äôs just a question of which generation wants to sweep it away.

The new global inequality: the affluent who are safe from violence &amp; the poor who are not. E.g. Brazil http://t.co/QX7RCWZf2u #gottachange
Globally, 90% of violent deaths occur OUTSIDE headliner zones of war or terrorism http://t.co/eKMSAoLruP Common reality of world's poorest.
Today in one part of the world grief: victims whisked away before @IJM rescue op. Joy in another: op saves 2 before they're abused. #reality
Every succes in the struggle for justice requires a costly risk of failure. A love of people must overome a love of perfection.

There is no doubt that slavery is going into the dustbin of history ‚Äì it‚Äôs just a question of which generation wants to sweep it away.

Fighting slavery only succeeds when those who are free &amp; powerful share their freedom &amp; power with those who are weakest &amp; enslaved.
We are in an era of transformation. God is doing something new and powerful in the world for his work of justice.

Violence frequently has two people working hard to make it hard to see: the perp who fears accountability &amp; the victim who feels shame.

Wht I'm learning abt trafficking: If the customers can find the victims, the police can. When the police switch sides it's game ovr 4 perps.
Wht I'm learning abt trafficking: 4 victims, poverty is part of what sets the trap but violence slams the door. Gotta deal w/ the violence.
Wht I'm learning abt trafficking: Perps dont care wht laws r on the books but wht laws r ENFORCED. They bribe police but dont pay lobbyists
Wht I'm learning abt trafficking/slavery: perps are not that brave - if they think they could go to jail for it, they stop doing it.
