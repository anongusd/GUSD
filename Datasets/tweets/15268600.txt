@Thelmadonna Fish and Wildlife are the ones who take it. I expect they’re on top of that sort of thing. Anyway, it’s out of my hands.
Took my 9-yr-old to local production of Into the Woods. Show got too real when we hit a buck on way home. We were ok. The deer lay dying. I turned up the radio so my daughter wouldn’t hear the shot. A cop who’s visited her class, luckily, &amp; the meat will go to a homeless shelter.
Today a student wrote: "Every time I leave his room to return to mine,	the walk seems longer and the night puckers in a way that’s kind of rude, like there’s something it knows and it’s waiting for me to figure out that I know it too." That's so good.

Speaking of movies: My late father collected DVDs of his favorites to watch again in his last days. Two boxes worth, unopened. Then, in January, unexpectedly, he died fast, too sick to watch. So over the next year I’m going to watch for him. A selection: https://t.co/rxaecmEFoa
How did I not know Tolkien got Treebeard from the Bible? “I see men as trees, walking.” Mark 8:24. Put another way, how did I not know there are ents in scripture?
Cleaning out my late father’s apartment. Two boxes of his brother’s things. The first Jeff Sharlet. Died slow and painful in a VA hospital, 1969. These were the paperbacks by his bedside. https://t.co/nN3hyWDMjo
Brothers. My uncle, the first Jeff Sharlet, dead at 27 in ‘69; my father, Bob, 83, Jan. 26th. Jeff was probably a casualty of war; he’d been soaked in Agent Orange. Bob was a beneficiary of war; it gave him his career as a scholar. He would’ve traded it for his brother. https://t.co/4RqG0xSFBA

@TPLMaggie Probably not in depth law books about Brezhnev’s agricultural reforms.
@jpnKevin_T No. Any collection that would want these books already has them. Libraries must discard books to make room for new books. Some books never get discarded, but of the moment 1970s and 80s political science is mostly ephemeral.
What a lot of people don't realize is that libraries breathe books -- in, and out. They can't keep them all. There is no library in the world that would accept my father's dusty political science books on the Andropov regime. https://t.co/TNeo0mGPpH
@hobnob He had thousands of books. Years ago he sent hundreds or more to a small caribbean university. He kept his political science soviet books. They are of a time. I don't have the room for them. They're like journalism; it dates.
Sifting my late father's library. Books to keep, books to give away, books to sell. Books to discard. Worst, hardcovers that will never be read again. They can't be recycled in cloth, so you have to tear the boards off. It feels like murder.  https://t.co/zACQKe7Ut1
30 years ago my mother, an unpublished writer, died. I spent years trying to make a book out of fragments she left behind. 3 weeks ago my father died. He finished his last work, a memoir, on his deathbed. Now it's my job, my fortune, to make a book out of what he left behind.
I watched Russian Doll during breaks packing up my late father's apartment. Eerie mirroring: I'd pack, watch, look up, and there'd be things missing, things I packed, pictures gone from the walls, vases disappeared, a little world unraveling, as in Russian Doll.
I almost didn't stick w/ Russian Doll because I saw so much buzz about hilarious it was. But it wasn't. Kind of funny, but not really. @alexanderchee told me to keep watching. Thank god I did. It's not about the funny.  It's terrifying and beautiful.

Another night with the dying man. He's sleeping now, so I'm going to slip out of the hospital to look at the blood moon. I wish I could take him with me. In life he was a rationalist, but as he lays dying, his imagination, his hallucinations, his dreams, are spectacular.
Open the new New Yorker and it’s a profile of a comics writer, a director, and a pop star, plus an Atlantic like pop social science story. Nothing against the pieces but I wish there was a magazine that wasn’t just about famous people.

When I say "The Syllabus," Or "my syllabus," I'm speaking of real syllabi I write for real courses at @dartmouth. But it's also shorthand for all that I love or find fascinating or profound. All that I get to share w/ student-writers, asking them to imagine, "Maybe, like *this.*"
I'm a late adaptor. 5:40 am, up all night with a very sick relative in the hospital, I finally got to watch Hannah Gadsby's "Nanette." Oh, my. Onto the syllabus it goes.
I'm going to keep going with it. I assumed it was basically a traditional true crime procedural, but the enthusiasm for it tells me it's more than that. https://t.co/rAdxhrtobl
@unalignedblog No, I don't think we're all telling stories. Most podcasts, in fact, are either conversational -- an interview, say -- or expository, intended to convey information as efficiently as possible. Narrative is driven by character, scene, plot, etc.
@todd534 I like Bear Brook. But does it depart from procedural conventions in any way? I think it’s very strong true crime, but would you say it’s narratively innovative? (Or meant to be?)

@kaitlinprest Looks good. But I should have specified I’m looking for nonfiction.
@LyraMcKee Yep. Pretty good. Can podcasts do other things beside true crime? Makes me think of an ancestor of literary journalism in 19th century “sporting” men’s true crime tales.
@jacobenglander It does — but then they show their expository hand by ending not with the subject but with a wrap up of where they think ISiS stands. As if they didn’t trust the power of what they’d found to stand on its own, or the listener to encounter it as synecdoche for the big picture.
@luolkowski Agree — and I was just making the case to a friend that its bluntness doesn’t make it less sophisticated than Serial. I think it does push the form.
@phiguru Oh yeah, Crimetown was good, sometimes great. But not—with respect—ambitious, like Serial and S-Town. Not something to give students to provoke their own imaginations of what they might do.
@luolkowski I expand in the thread below. (Indebted to you for In the Dark rec. And eagerly awaiting your next.)
@PhilMoscovitch It’s fine. Two episodes in, though, it’s mainly a conventional procedural.
@jacobenglander It’s good! Almost great. But it cuts itself off at the knees, falling back on exposition as justification just as it really complicates the story of its main subject.
@zunguzungu Yeah. Clumsy term, shorthand to distinguish from the legion of conversation podcasts.
What I’d really love recommendations for: *immersive* narrative podcasts. So many history stories. Fine. Good. But my intro to the possibilities, decades ago, were Scott Carrier’s “Running with Antelope” &amp; Larry Masset’s “Night on Mt Shasta.”
Then there’s the problem of exposition. So many podcasts, seemingly nervous about their power to tell stories, fall back on explaining. As if that, at least, will justify their eartime. Perhaps. But consider those that do both.
(I’m not going to name names. Point isn’t to bash any particular podcast. Point is to talk about the form as it stands.)
As if to avoid being found wanting as documentary art, they’re quick to declare that they’re not art — just, you know, curious about this or that.
Too many *narrative* podcasts (I’m not talking about yr fave chat shows) perform this off kind of folksy, colloquial humility, even at the expense of the subject.
I’ve been listening to so many narrative podcasts looking to add to my syllabus. So many that are ok, even good. But almost all... constrained.
Best all-time *narrative* podcasts, besides Serial, S-Town, &amp; In The Dark?

@sivavaid That's if you believe "good consequences" are an option in Syria and that the U.S. has much of a track record since WWII of bringing about such. Assad won; ISIS isn't a justification; Erdogan's gonna Erdogan; &amp; the biggest threat to human life is the U.S. pro-war w/ Iran gang.
@sivavaid Yes, it should, &amp; yes, the impending crushing of the Kurds is abomination. Better wld have been to press for a deal btwn Assad &amp; &amp; Kurds &amp; then get out. But wld that have slowed Turkey? Maybe not. Meanwhile, leaving-right way or wrong way-seems to diminish hawk position on Iran.

@jonakland I'm not. She faced serious sexism and named it as such. She also called for women to be more "self-effacing" lest they "cross over into B--- territory." Her words. She said she feels it unfair but necessary. But the fact that she faced sexism doesn't justify her sexist solution.

Seems critics dismiss Buster Scruggs as minor because its mood is both morbid and comic, fully favoring neither vein. But I think of José Guadalupe Posada's skeletons, &amp; Joseph Mitchell's tribute to them, &amp; the eerie John Fahey songs from the records they adorn.
Critics either enjoy or disdain what many call the Buster Scruggs' evocation of Western "cliches." But what if they're not exactly cliches? What if they're myths? What if whatever they are is beside the point of these magical realist meditations on silence &amp; narration?
2/3 through The Ballad of Buster Scruggs I pause to read some reviews. Mistake! Here's a movie constructed to confound critics. It isn't "less ambitious" than other Coen brothers films; it's more strangely ambitious.

@johnlingan @LucasWMann What is it about Tarantino that makes you so surprised I'd like him? (John, I can't imagine he'd do better than Basterds, either, but that's no sleight against him. Still, Hateful Eight is some pretty interesting storytelling.)

“Saying ‘awww’ isn’t that different from saying ‘ewww.’” — @LucasWMann, CAPTIVE AUDIENCE: On Love and Reality TV.
On another blogger, a fascist proposes "sabotage" before civil war. This is an actual post, by an actual human being, on something called Raconteur Report. Seems like it ought to be investigated: https://t.co/aefPVEarcx
Another fascist commenter, though, calculates the left at 1 million, and fantasizes about "Rwanda with modern weaponry." https://t.co/hO7dSOhkaJ
What follows in the comments is a discussion of how many these fascists think they'll have to kill to make their point. Some think 10,000, others, hundred. Here's an "optimist" who proposes shooting "half a dozen" at a leftist rally: https://t.co/NE4Fqwmy8L

This is the kind of romanticism that I'm frustrated with. Folks who think street fighters in Berlin broke fascism, not a major alliance of world powers the spine of which was the authoritarian might of the Soviet Union. https://t.co/R9ZQ7TcsEq
@ParkerTRichards But it's not pertinent, since I'm not romanticizing the authoritarianism of the Soviet Union. I'm just saying that it's what broke global fascism last time. And nothing comparable to it exists now.
I didn't propose relying on communism. I'm saying the last time global fascism was defeated it took a global alliance of powers and most of all the vast sacrifices of the Soviet Union. None of that exists now. Meanwhile, what major liberal powers remain? https://t.co/hLKvzGeyZG
I agree that the priority is defeating fascism, but I'm puzzled by the legion of experts who say with great certainty "The way to beat fascism is..." Because last I checked it took a Soviet Union to beat fascism, and we don't have one of those at the moment.

@GothamGirlBlue My hope is that by acknowledging how much I dislike supporting conservative Democrats but declaring that I'll do it anyway, I'm encouraging others who feel the same way to nonetheless see the value of doing the same. Telling them to just shut up and give maybe won't work as well?
@GothamGirlBlue Right! That's why I gave money to so many of the conservative Democrats seeking to flip those foundation stones. Why are you attacking me for doing what it sounds like we both believe needs to be done? Because I'm not doing it with a smile?
@GothamGirlBlue I did support Spanberger, &amp; if you think it's problematic for me to dislike sending CIA agents to Congress, I'll accept the label. But most of the rest making Breitbart anxious are white men. So I supported them, too.
@GothamGirlBlue Right -- but the races Breitbart are most worried about are mostly conservative white male Democrats vs conservative white male Republicans.
@GothamGirlBlue The mostly conservative or centrist Democratic candidates I held my nose to support are definitely not dismantling white patriarchy.
@GothamGirlBlue If by "complaining" you mean spending the morning giving them money, sure. Terrible! We must give money to our betters and shut up! It is not our ours to question.

RIP, Joe. I think the praise you’d appreciate the most is that I thought you were wrong about so many things, &amp; yet I never doubted the goodness of your heart. Now I’m going to go into your gym, and wish you were here to stop by the treadmill to say something outrageous.
That’s part of what made us friends. He loved his alma mater, Dartmouth College, so he taught himself a kind of citizen journalist to become its sharpest critic. Sometimes because he disdained its liberalism, yes; more often over the years because he saw abuses of authority.
A lot of people assumed that given Joe’s vocal rightwing views that he was a rape culture denier. In fact, he quietly funded a young woman working on a book about campus sexual assault. He disliked the left, but he hated more the ways institutions cover up corruption.
I don’t mean to absolve my friend of the damage his sometimes hurtful &amp; ignorant blog posts did. That was real. I never pretended it wasn’t. He didn’t expect me too, anymore than he expected me to give up my beliefs. But his generosity was just as real.
Joe’s gym has a small crowd of people he gave discounts to because they had heart trouble or some other disease or needed a change. Ideologically and loudly, Joe was a hyper capitalist. Quietly, without attention, in ways he might claim to disapprove of, he gave &amp; gave.
After I had two very unexpected heart attacks at 44 two years ago, Joe asked me to join his gym. I knew I needed more exercise, but you know, it was expensive. I was looking for excuses. So Joe gave me a half price membership. I wasn’t the only one, I’d learn.
Joe was a right winger, and a curmudgeon. He was also a contrarian, which is part of why we were friends. A friendship that began in sharp disagreement and continued through lively disagreement — &amp; also his generosity.
Sitting in the parking lot outside my gym. Tuesday, my friend Joe, the owner, posted a suicide note on his blog and then killed himself. I knew he was troubled; I had no idea how troubled. I wish I’d asked.

Then the two boys responded by telling my daughter, yes, gay people are weird, plus she’s fat. And she did not care what they thought, because she does not live in their ugly world. That kind of courage doesn’t come easy to her. It’s something she’s worked for. #proudaspunch
Yesterday 2 boys &amp; a girl in my daughter’s 4th grade class — small progressive affluent Vermont public school — agreed gay people are “weird.” My daughter told them you can love who you want, be who you want, and that people who think like them live in an ugly world.
“Daddeee!” my daughter calls. A noise, she says, in the trees. I remember the door’s unlocked so I trot downstairs &amp; back. I’m like that these days. “H-h-hoo,” she explains, imitating no owl I’ve heard. “Or maybe it was a coyote.” She considers. “Because there are no wolves.”
This is a metaphor. (It’s also my dog Frieda.) https://t.co/OGbqeMnpIe

Moonless &amp; starless again last night so I walked up the hill to a firefly field, looking for some light. None. Walked a mile on by feel to another field &amp; another. 3rd field, I found 4. In the grass, pulsing so slowly. End of the season? End of the line. Lights out. Goodbye.

On a walk w/ my 9yrold early evening we came upon a garter snake that refused our attempts to help it off the road. Coiled &amp; struck 3 times. Later I ran alone in violet gloaming so velvety I could feel it against my face, rough &amp; soft. I looked for the snake but she was gone.
@Unemployedneg @theorygurl That's the fault of those who've abused the term for self-serving ends. They killed it; the deans will merely snack on its corpse.
Because the truth is that of course it isn't about *my* colleagues, &amp; of course it is at the same time, &amp; altho I don't teach grad students &amp; didn't go to grad school, it's about me, too. That's what institutionalization does: it eats us all alive.
"A culture of critics in name only, where genuine criticism is undertaken at the risk of ostracism, marginalization, retribution — this is where abuses like Avital’s grow like moss, or mold." Preach, @theorygurl.
"Structural problems are problems because real people hurt real people," writes @theorygurl, in response to theory star defenders of Avital Ronell. This is the kind of thing that gets you dismissed as an "empiricist" in the humanities. It's also the motherfucking truth.
Well put. And understanding that it's part of the culture, even if one doesn't directly suffer from it, shapes your actions, too. Sorta what "culture" means... https://t.co/1dFKnV35Id
@joshtpm Yeah -- it's "embed-ness" is part of what makes it powerful and disheartening at the same time. The matrix is too vast! But serious question for you: As a left intellectual, can you really fully leave academia? It shapes the whole left.

To characterize the case against Ronell as an attack on the left is the most profoundly conservative move her defenders could make: The personification of the left in their own elite circles. Like saying, The left, c'est moi.
To speak of vanities and the humanities in the same breath is, according to some defenders of Ronell, evidence of one's secret conservatism. No subtle way to put this, so I won't try: such a notion is simultaneously banal and pretentious as fuck.

Caterpillar days. Spent a half hour on my belly, nose close to the road - it’s a very quiet road -watching red-bulbed creepers pulsing &amp; yellow-bristled ridgebacks trundling, &amp; maybe a monarch-to-be. Yes, I have a job. This, I think, might be my job.
Night swamp under a humid and cloud-clotted moon. Crickets now, not frogs, and in the woods behind me a fox barking. Red tail lights dwindling up the hill, then vanishing. Goodnight, goodbye. A deer clicks across the blacktop, indifferent, unbothered by the car that’s gone.
Mars, again. The moon is lower, hazier; the red planet is higher, redder. I’m in a brightly-lit parking lot, too bright to see stars. Only Mars, far away and long ago, a comfort these mean August evenings.
In a month of troubled skies Mars has been so brightly visible beneath the moon that I think sometimes I can see its dead rivers. My nephew &amp; I laid down in the road and stared at it for a long time; its redness made us both happier.

@scaruso5555 I didn’t use the word “screaming.” Sounds like your imagination. Agents did yell. As I said, car was surrounded by, I’d guess, 5-6 agents. Why is that hard to believe? Especially if it was, as you suggest it could have been, a felony arrest?
@scaruso5555 Car was surrounded, but no, re agents were not pressing their bellies against the windows. About 8-10 feet back, I’d say. My daughter guessed her age because my daughter’s observant &amp; witnessing an arrest made a big impression. Is this what you can’t believe?

"Tell her to see if she can find different roads to get you from here to there," he says. The idea seems urgent to him. He sees his kids once a year. "Most roads leads you from here to there. Not all roads. But most roads take you wherever you want to go." ...
Lloyd would like to know: Do my kids learn the computers? My daughter does. Good, good. "&amp; teach her the roads," he advises. "Take a map. Say, 'We're here. Can you find a way?'" Set her to finding 3 ways. Anywhere to Anywhere. Norwich to Burlington. Morris to Jeff...
Ask what, I say.  "They said the kid was sweet," says Lloyd. "Sweet?" Asleep, he means to say. He's lost a lot of teeth. Some words come crooked now. The sweet kid: "The state worker never bothered to just peek on him," says Lloyd. "And the kid was dead."
"We don't have the kids anymore," Lloyd says. "Lost 'em to the state." I don't ask. Lloyd says. "Some people made comments about us. But others what was worse than us got their kids back." One couple got their kid back, &amp; then--"state worker never bothered to ask." ...
The computers, tho! Have I seen how the kids use them? "They block you out," Lloyd says. "You say, 'Son!' Or, 'Daughter!' They block you out." I ask: You have kids, Lloyd? A son, a daughter. "She's gonna be 18. And"--he pauses--"2nd or 3rd of August, our son'll be 14."

@Havalah I was in class at @hampshirecolg. Someone came w/ the news &amp; a lot of us walked out of class - profs included - to town. We occupied the streets, cops started arresting, we linked arms in front of buses, they started breaking links w/ sticks and swinging at anyone who came close.
@robotlemur @BlairBraverman If you're a secular humanist you might be more interested in The Family, which is about religion, politics, and power.
The point of this story isn't my pictures. It's what happened after I took them. The picture that I hated losing was the one of my daughter. Yes, I have about 10,000 more. Maybe it was a mistake. But maybe it was the pettiness of authoritarianism. The little bully jab.
Which brings me to the idea of recovering the photos. First, no they're not in recently deleted. They deleted those, too. But evidently they can still be recovered. To what end? They weren't particularly revealing. That's part of what made the reaction to them so grotesque...
This is why resistance to authoritarianism requires more than knowing your rights. It demands organizing, solidarity, &amp; documentation. My part of that is journalism. Some would say this makes me an activist, not a journalist. But that's a pretty thin definition of journalism.
The idea that I could have refused to give the border patrol my camera and gotten away with it is a movie. Has anyone ever done so? I'm sure. What are the odds? How do those odds play out with yr 9-yr-old daughter in the back seat?
So, at this point, I said, "Unhand me, public servant! I have the right to take photographs!" &amp; the cop apologized and helped me up. Right? Yeah, no, that didn't happen. Try telling a man with a gun about your rights. See how well he listens.
I wasn't quick enough to get a shot of a cop shoving a little old Quaker lady down, so I tried to get a close up of his face (they'd removed their badges). Instead, I got punched in mine. Then he drove me face-first into the steps of the moving bus taking away arrestees.
I'd recently been arrested for civil disobedience &amp; I had some kind of suspended deal, so I figured I'd do my bit with my camera. There was plenty to do: Cops in riot gear pretty quickly took out their sticks &amp; started swinging.
I learned my lesson about cameras &amp; cops early, at a protest during the Gulf War. Emotions were high; a man had burned himself to death in protest on the town green (Amherst, MA). A crowd came out. Rightwingers threw rocks. Cops stood by. Then they started arresting lefties...
Also, sadly, beside the point: My "right" to refuse. Lotta people -- mostly young dudes -- like to imagine what they'd tell a cop giving them an illegal order. I was like that once, too...
But the "legality" of men w/ guns taking your camera because you took a picture of them is, to me, beside the point. It's authoritarian if it's illegal, and it's even more authoritarian if it's been encoded in law.
Seems to be a lot of gray on the legality of the border guard taking my phone, despite the "no phones" sign. Most recent court ruling seems to suggest they can't do an electronic search unless they suspect crime. I don't think they did a electronic search. They just took it.

Anyway, before we got back on the road, I looked at my phone. Yes, they'd deleted the pictures I'd taken of border guards surrounding a Latinx couple; and, it seemed, they'd also deleted two previous, a pic of a mural &amp; a pic of my daughter smiling over a stawberry smoothie...
Authoritarianism cultivates paranoia &amp; self-censorship. It depends on us to internalize the ways in which it pushes around; it wants us to feel guilty for being afraid. It wants us to speak in the passive voice.
As my daughter saw at the border, authoritarianism targets POC first &amp; most severely; the secondary goal of white supremacy, tho, is to keep white subjects in line through a mix of privilege &amp; subtle punishment for questioning that privilege.
...as if the power of authoritarianism threatens only people of color. It threatens POC more; but it threatens *everybody.* That's what authoritarianism is. You do nobody any favors by imagining you're immune.
Because here's the thing: We got off "easy," right? White privilege, right? *Yes.* &amp; still it sucked, because of what happened &amp; because of the slime of fear &amp; complicity it left on us. I hear white liberals talk sometimes as if they've nothing to fear...
Later we came to a covered bridge on which someone had chalked "Love=Rage." That fit her mood, &amp; the chalk was still there, so she added her own message: "Keep our country colorful." That helped, but she was still mad.
My daughter knew we were lucky. She knew if she weren't 9, I might have had a harder time, that if we weren't white we might still be there. But the anger was personal, too. It was all mixed up. That's how power works.
When we got to St. Albans, VT, we pulled over and went for a walk. I asked my daughter if she'd been afraid. She surprised me. "No," she said. She thought for a moment. "Mostly, I was burning with anger."
The night before we'd watched The Hunger Games. (I know, a little much for a 9-yr-old. But she'd read the books, so...) We both thought of the evil "Peackeepers" &amp; their white uniforms, &amp; the shouting border guards in their black uniforms...
"It might have been," I said. She asked if we'd done something wrong taking pictures. "No," I said. She pointed out I'd said it was stupid. "Stupid because I got caught," I said. "Stupid because I was with you. I'm sorry." "It's not your fault," she said. Which was true...
I'm not reporting here, I'm just talking about crossing the border yesterday, on vacation w/ my daughter. Maybe that couple was wanted for real crimes, for all I know. But their car wasn't searched. "Was it like the kids?" my daughter asked. She meant on the Mexican border...
So even with the guns &amp; the yelling &amp; the confiscated phone, crossing back into the U.S. was a lot easier than out of Algeria, &amp; for that I was glad, &amp; ashamed. "What happened to the couple?" my 9-yr-old asked. I had to her I didn't know, that I was afraid we couldn't know...
The power of gender, of the men w/ guns who demanded flirtation as the price of crossing the border, &amp; of empire, the American one, that brought us to the front of the line, &amp; of borders, that put little tyrants in charge of lines in the sand...
They offered her sugar &amp; asked if she was married &amp; what kind of man she wanted to marry &amp; if she might marry an Algerian man. She smiled. After three hours, they let us cross. Everyone else remained, inside the country collapsing into war. That's how power works...
I asked her what she'd said. "I said, 'My brother's an idiot,'" she told me. Soon, more soldiers surrounded us: delighted by the young American woman fluent in Arabic. (She's an Arabic lit scholar.) They let me stand, but they made her tea...
We were visibly American. A soldier separated us from the crowd. His rifle strap was too big for his frame, &amp; as he walked the gun slapped his ass. Bap, bap, bap. I was 20, dumb, &amp; I laughed. Bad move. My sister began apologizing. Then she said something in Arabic; he laughed...
This was in 1992. A civil war broke out while we were there. An Islamic party had won a fair election, &amp; the gov't had responded w/ tanks. Some 100,000 would die, but we didn't see any fighting: just a vast crowd, trying to flee, like us, at a remote desert crossing...
I've reported in countries where men with guns forbid pictures, &amp; I've had men point their guns at me &amp; order me to delete my pictures. But before I was a journalist, when I was 20, I crossed the Sahara with my older sister. We ran into trouble in Algeria...
Now, I can imagine some folks saying, "I can't believe you apologized to those fascists!" To which I'll say: That's how power works. It makes you complicit. It makes you craven. I've experienced it before...
I said what I believed needed to be said, especially with my 9-yr-old holding my hand: "I'm sorry. I was stupid." The guard nodded, &amp; handed over our passports &amp; my phone. "We deleted the pictures you took," he said...
Sure enough, after awhile a guard called us -- ahead of the black family &amp; the Asian family in between which we'd been sitting, both waiting longer than us. I went to the counter, glad &amp; guilty &amp; furious. A guard held our passports &amp; my phone...
I was worried about my daughter, of course. And that concern shaped something ugly in me: A hope that our whiteness would keep us out of further trouble. One more aspect of power's control: it plucks the strings of the ugliest chords within you...
I'm not suggesting that the U.S. border guards had a deliberate plan to favor white people over non-whites. They just appeared to do so. They weren't all white themselves. That's how power works, too: the uniform is that of white supremacy.
Why were white people called before the many non-white families who'd been waiting longer? You can guess easily as my 9-yr-old did, but the journalist in me can't say for sure. That's part of power: evidence of discrimination without certainty. Everyone guessing.
Inside was a room crowded, mostly with families. Not detained; paused. Some longer than others. There was no line. "You wait for them to call your name," another dad explained. I noticed something; Saira noticed, too. They kept calling the white people...
"Daddy," she asked, "are you going to get arrested, too?" I sighed. "No," I said, "I don't think so, but I might lose my phone." This distressed her, too -- it was filled w/ our vacation pictures. "Pull over," the guard said. "Go through the green door."
He grabbed my phone. "I'm sorry," I said. I was w/ my daughter; not a time to invoke journalism. He held up his hand &amp; then began scrolling. Well past the two pics I'd just taken. Which constitutes an illegal search, no? I was more worried about my daughter...
I took pictures. There's a sign on the border booth forbidding cameras, &amp; I didn't notice, so that part's on me. The prohibition of documentation of armed agents of the state? That's on the U.S. government. The guard, tho, blamed me...
They repeated the drill with the man in the passenger seat. He kept glancing over his shoulder as he walked back w/ hands in air, &amp; they kept yelling at him, but he didn't want to fall. Not a time for any mistakes. That's when I made mine...
"About 28," Saira later estimated. Wore a nice white tank top, glasses. Latinx. Hands in the air. Face stunned and scared. They made her walk backwards, grabbed her arms. "Are they going to--" Saira asked. They did. They cuffed her.
Our guard had his hand on his gun, too, &amp; his eyes on the car. "Out of the car!" a guard barked. I was confused. It'd pulled up after us. There'd been no search, no time for search. They couldn't have found drugs. A woman emerged...
Entering U.S. involved a lot more questions. The guard questioned Saira. Who is, as I said, nine. But she smiled a lot and all was ok; then he told us to turn off the car, &amp; Saira gasped. Border patrol were surrounding car next to us, hands on their guns, shouting...
What do you tell your kids about borders? Crossing into Canada a few days ago, I warned my 9-yr-old, Saira (not her real name), not to giggle. Crossing was a breeze. Coming back, I said, would take longer...

Not at all. The Family is not a conspiracy. It's a rightwing movement that figures such as #MariaButina find easy to turn to their ends. It's well-documented &amp; since 2010 has acknowledged its work. You not paying attention doesn't equal conspiracy theory. https://t.co/oXftR52rEm
I've suggested that Putin &amp; Trump are just the kind of guys National Prayer Breakfast organizers in the Family love. They compare Jesus to the worst strongmen of history: "Hitler, Lenin, Mao." &amp; leader Doug Burleigh, a Russia hand, has long argued for Putin-Trump dialogue.
Doug Burleigh founded Moscow Prayer Breakfast - offshoot of National Prayer Breakfast - at which #MariaButina scheme appears to have picked up steam in 2016. Burleigh spoke, along w/ her handler, Alexander Torshin, at 2017 Russian Prayer Breakfast. https://t.co/FkdHcvkirb

This report by @jackmjenkins is the most important work out right now on the #MariaButina / National Prayer Breakfast connection. If you care about this story, read this. https://t.co/FkdHcvkirb
Just as the Prayer Breakfasters sent American politicians to Germany to meet former Nazis banned from the U.S. in the 50s &amp; 60s, they've been sending Americans to Russia to meet banned Russians -- including Alexander Torshin, #MariaButina's boss.
By early 50s, Zapp - whose capture had been frontpage news across , like #MariaButina - was advising congressman. On what? Christian values. &amp; since the Prayer Breakfasters couldn't get S.S. man Baron von Gienanth into U.S., they sent congressmen to him in Germany.
&amp; like #MariaButina, Zapp &amp; fellow Nazi spy Ulrich von Gienanth were nabbed by the FBI. Not much pre-trial detention for them -- they were traded for two Americans. That shld have been that, but then the Prayer Breakfasters got involved...
Zapp, like #MariaButina - &amp; like the Christian Right today - thought the U.S. shld embrace its inner authoritarianism. Along with another Nazi spy, he sought backdoor communications between American elites &amp; the Third Reich... https://t.co/imZn19pm8d
Zapp was a lot smoother than #MariaButina. He actually avoided talk of politics, and somehow found himself at dinner with FDR -- whose reelection he had secretly worked against. Authoritarian election meddling is an old practice.... https://t.co/oRMTnMPq2N
Starting in 1938, Zapp posed as a German journalist in Manhattan, a glamorous figure who moved among the elite and even made Walter Winchell's gossip columns. But he had another agenda... https://t.co/Rf4IfKxlpx
The National Prayer Breakfast's organizer, The Family, has a long history of serving as a backchannel for spies, long before #MariaButina. As I write in THE FAMILY, the very first was Manfred Zapp -- Nazi spy...
Remember the Fellowship really came to public attention in 2009 with 3 political sex scandals, all of which the Fellowship covered up. Even congressional wives are on record saying their husbands are loyal to their Fellowship "brothers" first, actual families second. https://t.co/1O95vz0kPE
You get me. https://t.co/m4NuL7PM7D

Oh, good. Because if there's one area where slavish ideological purity really helps, it's in healthcare for veterans. They'll be thankful for the opportunity to serve their country once again as fodder for the advancement of crooked hacks! https://t.co/r2JmvKwSVx

Siljander was no more naive than #MariaButina - or the National Prayer Breakfast organizers who helped her. He pulled the same trick again &amp; again, &amp; confessed lying to FBI. For Jesus, of course. Cynical? Not exactly. This is what the National Prayer Breakfast is *for.*
National Prayer Breakfast organizers weren't distant from Siljander's illegal lobbying, either. Leader Doug Coe went w/ him to meet Sudan's Omar al-Bashir, only sitting head of state indicted for war crimes. "They realize it"-genocide-"got away from them," Siljander explained.
Former GOP rep Siljander, Christian fundamentalist, pled guilty to accepting $$ from Sudan's genocidal regime -- through National Prayer Breakfast organizers -- to lobby for the regime fronts to be removed from terrorism lists. Like #MariaButina, he claimed it was for Jesus.
#MariaButina is not the first time The Family has been involved in an actual legal conspiracy. In 2010, former GOP rep Mark Siljander dodged a federal conspiracy charge by pleading to acting as unregistered agent of foreign power: Sudan, which funneled $$ to him thru The Family.
What's a spy scandal without sex? #MariaButina knows that sometimes you have to pretend to be into sex w/ old men for the sake of "family values." https://t.co/hvI6On8an9

Why wld #nationalprayerbreakfast organizers help Putin? Because they embrace an unorthodox theology of strength, comparing their idea of Christ to "Hitler, Lenin, and Mao," &amp; describing his true servants on earth as "wolf kings."
Watergate felon Chuck Colson - released from prison thru intervention of The Family / #NationalPrayerBreakfast - praised it as "veritable underground of Christ's men all through government," admiring its ability to move power behind scenes. So did #MariaButina
"The more invisible you can make your organization," boasted Doug Coe, longtime leader of The Family &amp; #nationalprayerbreakfast, "the more influence it will have." #MariaButina agrees.
The Family - the group the organizes the National Prayer Breakfast, and which helped #MariaButina bring in Russian spies - believes Christianity wrongly focuses on "sheep." They believe God has called them to serve the "wolves."

@ItheMissingLink This is not a good source. I was leaked internal communication from The Family boasting that they'd effectively planted this story in The New Yorker as a counter to my reporting. The author went on to Fox News.
The Family - &amp; spies like Maria Butina - use the National Prayer Breakfast precisely because it's not transparent. “It totally circumvents the State Department and the usual vetting within the administration that such a meeting would require,” an internal source boasts.
Lobbyists &amp; foreign nationals use the #nationalprayerbreakfast as "a way to gain entrée to all sorts of people,” the late Michael Cromartie, an evangelical Washington think tanker declared. “And entrée they do get.” #RussianPuppet
The #nationalprayerbreakfast is all over the affidavit for Russian spy Maria Butina. I wrote two books, THE FAMILY &amp; C STREET, about its organizers, the most influential - &amp; secretive - Christian conservative group in DC, known as The Fellowship &amp; internally as The Family.

Sorry. I didn't notice that. I was agreeing with the point about audio documentary. I like @jiatolentino's writing a great deal. But she is a cultural critic, isn't she? I'm looking here at a different genre. https://t.co/mN0ygEDNpe
As ever, but more than ever. https://t.co/aBu2glJ3cn
This is a good point. Some of the best -- and most aesthetically interesting -- reportage in recent years has been in audio documentary. https://t.co/VZxVkN6ssz
I didn't get far with this threat, but @paperalphabet's response naming an aesthetically conservative trend in publishing leaves me something to think about as I return to working on my book, by which I mean perusing more shelves here at the library...
Oh, I didn't let myself think it -- but yes. "A conservative impulse in publishing &amp; aesthetics right now." Extends to fiction, too. What's it about? My go-to answer is usually that corporate publishing, ever more consolidated, systematically underestimates readers. https://t.co/VSELzbOXzD
Slouching Toward Bethlehem. Behind the Beautiful Forevers. Praying for Sheetrock. (These are all by white women. The genre is far, far too white -- which speaks both to who gets resources to report &amp; how editors imagine who CAN report.) https://t.co/YXPX55iJ6W
@paperalphabet I agree that it's new. I've gladly participated in that pushback as a teacher, critic, and reading host. I guess I think the problem is that while that ground was being won, publishing &amp; media was quietly centrifuging reportage out of the mix.
Agree -- but how did it get to be small? I really don't know. Maybe part of the fault lies in magazines, which more and more publish neither personal essays nor reportage but what are essentially traditional, aesthetically conservative essays. https://t.co/CJd2LVC4lH
@paperalphabet Earnest question: Who is looking down on them now? Not popular critics, not publishers, not booksellers, not readers. Literary studies academics? Nonfiction of any variety barely exists in their eyes. Dudes thumping DFW tomes like Bibles? They look down on us all.
I'm writing this in my local library, which I depend on for test-reads of new nonfiction before buying it at my local bookstore. As w/ last visit, several excellent personal essay collections from writers I love, big hits; plenty of narrative history; zero literary journalism.
Right -- there's a long history of this foolish (and often sexist) critique of "personal" essays. But who's leveling it now? Certainly not publishers or booksellers. https://t.co/7vDQ0UrF8g
Are they looked down-upon? They were, but now? They seem to be thriving, as they should be. Book-length reported literary journalism seems to be fading. Certainly publishers are more excited about "personal" work now. I love &amp; teach it both. But it's reportage that's at risk. https://t.co/xC5vMQiOl7
I think we're in a golden age for creative nonfiction, &amp; narrative history seems to thrive as well. But literary journalism - not just narrativized exposition, but true stories - is, in the bookstores &amp; libraries I visit, harder &amp; harder to find.
(Disclaimer: I'm not referring to my publishers. I've been lucky to work with editors who understand that this tension between essays about the self and the world isn't artistic, it's about marketing, &amp; it underestimates readers *who can care about both.*)
The disdain for the personal is, indeed, sexist. So is much of publishing's insistence on it, especially when responding to reportage from women writers.
Anecdotal evidence: Editors &amp; friends who speculate that I would have sold a lot more of my last book, would sell a lot more of my next book, if my essays were "personal." They were/are personal. I am a person, &amp; I write about other persons, who I think matter a great deal.
But my quibble with this defense is that it imagines the essays that have most thrilled me throughout my life--reported literary journalism, often intimate even as they explore other people's lives--as somehow still dominant. Not sure if they ever were, but definitely not now.
So lately I've seen a lot of pushback against those who'd label essays about or through the self ("personal essay" doesn't really contain all that I mean) as narcissistic. The defense reads this charge as largely gendered &amp; sexist. I agree with this.
Perfect response to my tweet on the current tension between essays about or through the self and essays about or through other people's lives. https://t.co/HrU6S484nS
I should clarify: By "essay" I mean true stories. Usually but not always prose. "Essay" includes the traditional essay, which is either scholarly or Very Serious, but that's not so much my concern.
I'm avoiding working on a proposal for a collection of essays, which means thinking about essay collections. &amp; the weird tension right now between essays about, or through, the self, and essays about other people's lives...

@vapemyworld Yes, and I believe the fight against white supremacy is the most important fight in the world, that white supremacy defines the fascism of the U.S. and thus is the dominant force. I also believe we live in a global fascist moment in which it it is converging with other fascisms.
I think this idea, widespread, is understandable but mistaken. Fascism manifests in U.S., Europe, &amp; to lesser extent S. America as white supremacism. Differently in Philippines, Indonesia, China, Syria, etc. The convergence of fascisms is the global crisis. https://t.co/ezuAVaCj51

@LibertyIsALady @penndragonArt You’ve missed the point. Bruce isn’t saying Koch’s aren’t awful. He’s saying a singular focus on Kochs as masterminds misses the much larger and even more threatening contours of the American Right.
Those who say “this is not America” may be neglecting the role played by the U.S. in the creation of the conditions in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, &amp; elsewhere that so many flee. “America,” even the bright side, has always cast a long and terrible shadow.
Likewise the press wonders if there’s a rift between evangelicals &amp; Trump because evangelical elites denounce separation. Meanwhile, 75% of white evangelicals embrace policy of separation.
It cannot be emphasized enough that the fascist moment is not just a matter of ugly Americans; it’s global, it’s a movement, and fighting it is a struggle bigger than the Mueller investigation. https://t.co/im86LPvtNT
What’s perpetuating the myth of the moderate Republicans who are going to stop the separations? Polls show majority of GOP voters support it. GOP elites wring their hands, aware of “optics,” but they keep an even closer eye on voter desires. They’ll follow their base into hate.

@joshnathankazis Just DM'd you with an urgentish kind of query.
For every Stewart there are literally hundreds of lobbyists, executives, Koch shills, defense contractors, &amp; old school Christian Right organizers. Stewart is a monster and shld not be ignored; but he is centered at the cost of the big picture. https://t.co/PZ75phO5Dx

For instance, so long as the left sees the Christian Right as about only "social issues," the Christian Right -- &amp; big business -- will keep winning the long game.
Even on RW issues big business doesn't care as much about -- immigration, LGBTQ rights -- it mostly gets out of the way of the rightwingers who do, so long as they keep serving empire.
Yes &amp; no, right? Stewart still isn't the heavy hitting rightwing power -- big business &amp; the ol' fashioned military industrial complex remain more in charge than not, in part because much of the left neglects empire for clickbait like Stewart or Fred Phelps. https://t.co/Hp75k0rBok

@mariabustillos I've sat next to people on airplane or subway reading one of my books four times. Three times The Family. I said hi once. Once, to my much greater pleasure, the much more obscure Sweet Heaven When I Die, across from me on subway. I said nothing but floated all day.
@joshtpm Maybe '86, '87? I should add I think it was NOI -- I have it somewhere but I haven't seen it in years. It was about Islam, &amp; I later learned about NOI, so I simply assumed.
@joshtpm I was, I think, 15 or 16. O'Hare. He gave me the pamphlet but I didn't imagine it was him. He'd gotten lost &amp; waited for his handlers to find him. A crowd gathered. I said, "You're Muhammad Ali!" He said, "Hello." I didn't even know what NOI was at the time. He signed it for me.

Roth brought us Bruno Schulz, but Ozick, in "The Pagan Rabbi" &amp; The Puttermesser Papers, was his closer cousin, a hybrid between worlds, new and old, real and imagined. But her mind was darker even than Schulz'; The Puttermesser Papers is among the scariest books I've ever read.
(Let us never forget the shallowness of the literary world, either: Bellow presided over intellectual acolytes, Roth attended parties. Ozick was no barrel of laughs, &amp; dressed frumpy, because, she said, she reserved her imagination for her work.)
Ozick's reputation is less than that of Roth &amp; Bellow because she's a woman, of course, but also because in a sense she was truer to her art: She wrote at whatever length her stories demanded. She did not need to thump us so steadily with great heavy tomes.
Ah, but Ozick. She endured. Her politics, atrocious, her nonfiction sometimes dull, her fiction has never been less than astonishing, &amp; terrifying. Even as just a story, "Envy, or Yiddish in America" is the great American Jewish novel.
Goodbye Columbus, Portnoy's Complaint -- ever sentence was amphetamine. Misogynist? Unquestionably. As powerful a depiction of it from the inside as I've read. By Sabbath's Theater, though, that had curdled; like Sabbath, Roth became a bitter old know-it-all who missed too much.
Don't get me wrong. Roth means a great deal to me, even if I gave my copy of Sabbath's Theater away &amp; couldn't get through a novel of his ever since. But before that...! American Pastoral is commentary. The Counterlife was the art.
So many declarations of Roth as the last of a generation. As if Toni Morrison isn't the same generation. But even if we speak only of Jewish writers -- there is Cynthia Ozick, his equal.

@tgordonvideo Yes, but the point is that anti-blackness in particular fosters the idea of constant menace which leads police to respond to all sorts of situations with unnecessary violence.
Watching Handmaid's Tale ep 2 of season 2. Nooses in the Boston Globe building. Reminds me of that t-shirt photographed at a Trump rally: journalist, noose, tree, some assembly required. That, of course, is just rhetoric. Right?
News from Nowhere update: I deleted two tweets because I incorrectly said Claremont, NH cop charged w/ planting weapons. Wrong! Arrested &amp; charged w/ an illegal search &amp; falsifying report. Same cop exonerated after a murky 2016 killing.
Correction: Claremont cop who killed Cody LaFont NOT charged with planting weapons, but rather with lying about searching for them. Principle stands: Cop exonerated in murky case now stands accused of lying.
Part of the problem may be media's literalism when it comes to race. With a white cop &amp; a white victim, too much of the media can't see the killing as shaped by systemic racism within policing which makes the gun the go-to answer.
But there's a media problem here, too. Three killed by cops in my rural area in last few years; how many more dead are there beyond the gaze of the national media? 4/
White cops, white victims. But that doesn't mean race doesn't play a role. Racism is at the heart of police power in the U.S., the violent imagination by which cops go for the gun when they don't need to. 3/

In light of Toronto killer Alek Minassian's apparent admiration for misogyny killer Elliot Rodger, worth re-upping my reporting from a convention of "men's rights activists." https://t.co/XNQQW5EfT6
CBC, reputable source, reports that Facebook verifies that the post praising Elliot Rodger was real and made by Alek Minassian: https://t.co/hdvGbYvS8Y https://t.co/ZH4AHEdrI6
&amp; the press is falling down on the job by repeating the line that there's no national security threat. Misogynistic violence -- linked, incidentally, to so many other forms of hatred which imagine the other as feminine -- is *the* threat.
If Alek Minassian was driven by the same hate as his hero Elliot Rodger, he was a conspirator in the biggest terror plot of all: That of men whose minds are twisted by misogyny, who take that terrible logic to violent ends.
One of the best works of art I've encountered in any medium in several years. Thrilled that it's being recognized. https://t.co/WPdXgmiihu
Official story is there's no indication of terrorism in the murderous actions of Alek Minassian. By which the press means he's not a Muslim or a Nazi. &amp; yet there's a very strong indicator: his admiration of mass murderer Elliot Rodger. The terror indicated is that of misogyny.

Which I know isn't a good reason to trash talk another writer. But still. Calling Williamson "provocative" is like declaring a fratboy who pisses off his roof "transgressive."
I admit that I did this because it's been galling me that as I prepare a book for submission to publishers -- a strange book with who knows what, if any, future -- I imagine Williamson is likely getting a fat deal for some bullshit about "censorship."
I shldn't have done it but I read through some of Kevin Williamson's essays, not for content but to see his much-lauded style. I get this kind of work from a certain kind of student sometimes. Ponderous, inflated, mannered, infatuated with a romantic notion of essayists of old.
Anyone arguing that Kevin Williamson was fired merely for "opposing abortion" is not only dishonest but an implicit apologist for Williamson's now well-established genocidal misogyny.

@CBLK08 No, they don't need to turn a blind eye. Mainstream evangelicalism teaches we're all sinners. The oddity was the 80s-90s Christian Right's insistence on morally pure candidates. Meanwhile, Family-style religion teaches God can use as a tool whoever he wants.
@CBLK08 Thanks. I don't think evangelicals, writ large, are anti-democracy, but there is an undemocratic reverence for authority that has always suffused major strands of evangelicalism.
Calling for death penalty for millions of women is not an "argument," it's not a "side," it's not a "provocation." It's a genocidal fantasy. Some hire, @TheAtlantic!
I've been refraining from contentious twitter for months now, so I hesitated before writing this--then I realize this shldnt be a contentious point: The Atlantic hiring Kevin Williamson, who has called for the death penalty for women who have abortions, is fucking revolting.

Slight correction: $70,791 is tuition, room and board (there's no other game in town) and mandatory fees. This remains a dystopic sum.

The NYT's publication of Christian Broadcasting Network host David Brody's wildly contextless Trump puff piece -- a promo for his profoundly cynical new book -- should be generating more anger than all of the paper's many missteps in its coverage of the right combined.
@BlackRoseSec I wrote a second book, called C Street.
We talked about not feeling surprised, &amp; about how hard it is to tell a true story when you think you already know it because you've heard it so many times before. We talked about recovering surprise. That's part of the work before us, always, every time this happens.
One student said every time something like this happens (consider that phrase) she has to "rethink the memory" of the last time. &amp; yet, feels "desensitized." That's because, I suspect, she, we, have internalized these events. They're inside us now. Like radiation.
My students, who were 12 or 13 at the time of the Sandy Hook killings, have grown up with mass killings as an ordinary part of life. It's hard for them to imagine otherwise. They heard the news, &amp; sighed, &amp; went back to their studies or their practice or their friends.
Then we remembered we'd had an active shooter near Dartmouth at the beginning of the school year. Seemed so long ago. We'd forgotten. I had, too, even tho it locked down my daughter's school. Shooter only killed 1 person, so... Such are the standards by which we engage the news.
A third student said yeah, that's the policy of the police active shooter response guide he's reading as research for an essay he's writing about the time he was caught in a stampede at Penn Station following a false active shooter report.
Another student recalled a shooting threat at his school. But since the threat named the day, the school's policy was to bring in security but go on as normal, on assumption that if threatener was serious he wouldn't tip them off like that.
One student recalled a few weeks his senior year, last year, when a threat came every day. They never caught whoever it was. Soon it became routine, and even almost welcome -- "oh, good, 20 minutes off French class."
I did discuss this with my students today. One from near Parkland, another from near Newtown, nearly all of them, it seemed, from schools where bomb scares and shooting threats had become almost routine, so ordinary that they felt no surprise over yesterday's killings.
When something like this happens you have to talk with your students the next morning. I'm so tired of talking about this -- this, again, again -- with students just coming into the knowledge of how powerless they are, how bitterly vacant are the words "thoughts and prayers."
I wish I didn't know this. I wish I'd waited til tomorrow to check the news. My wife, reading a story to our kids, still doesn't know. So the news, it's going to break here again. The news, it just keeps breaking, and breaking, and breaking.

@ttthomas1 No, but we can pay attention to cultural signifiers in a way the reporter didn't. The Nazi didn't choose a bar, or a clubhouse; he chose a chain that markets itself as more gourmet, aka more cosmopolitan. One whose customers may imagine themselves removed, by taste, from fascism.
@AndyKirn @KrisK75USMC @_selfagency Respectfully, I think you may be overlooking journalistic conventions which are problematic not just in profiles of Nazis but even in "everyday" journalism &amp; profiles of people we admire.
@ttthomas1 I'm not assuming you misunderstood banality of pasta. I'm arguing that the banality of pasta matters, and that a better article would have done something with it.
@AndyKirn @KrisK75USMC @_selfagency Better to ask why the reporter didn't give examples of the subject's former political life so we could understand what he meant by his terms.
Me, neither. But we have one. And it has always been one in which racism is normal, no quotes. Recognizing that, I think, is a first step in any struggle against it. https://t.co/jfogiSjtE1
@sarahposner @KatzOnEarth Isn't the bottom line that the normally unexamined religious truth of consumerism is that most people imagine that those who share their tastes - Seinfeld, Twin Peaks, NPR - share their beliefs? And that this is a powerfully dangerous delusion?

Not least fact that I reported on the anti-gay cossacks, among others. The deep cynicism about power that editor inadvertently engendered.
It's not "flirting" when someone in a position of power flexes his power.
&amp; the way power makes you complicit in its expression. We tried to laugh it off - which only affirmed &amp; strengthened our editor's power.
Obv, our editor's hazing of us had nothing to with whether he was gay or we were. It had to do w/ him abusing his power.
I kept quiet about the story also because I didn't want people to think we were offended because he was gay. That was stupid.
Also worth noting that misogyny played role here - our editor feminized my coauthor as pretty &amp; me as "the man" to arrange his services.
Crucial to emphasize that what my coauthor &amp; experienced a tiny fraction of what so many women endure. Absolutely crucial.
Anyway, reading this much-worse story of Dustin Hoffman's harassment of an intern made me think of all that.
Taking the story of the editor asking for a blowjob out of the statement made me angry, ashamed. I felt like a coward.
That story in my tenure statement was fine. The more formative one about an editor asking for a blowjob was not. I don't know why.
Of a cossack I met reporting in Russia who told horrific stories of violence against gay men &amp; then pointed a gun at me &amp; said "write.
You might say it was the vulgarity. But replaced the editor asking for a blowjob w/ an equally vulgar story:
I trusted her, &amp; she was one of the people who'd be voting on my tenure. So I took it out. Why did she tell me to do so?
I showed it to a senior colleague. A wonderful, sensitive person. She told me, "Oh, no, you mustn't mention this."
That cynicism has profoundly shaped my writing career. So I started the tenure statement w/ the editor's request for a blowjob.
In thinking about it, I realized how formative that night w/ our editor was. How cynical it'd made me about publishing.
I had to write a tenure statement. I'm a writer, not an academic, so I didn't know how. Colleagues said, account truthfully for yr work.
Our editor left the press, &amp; his successor was great. We published our book, and many more books. Then, a few years ago...
For years, I've written the story off as "just the way it is." &amp;, really, it's nothing - *nothing* - compared to what so many women endure.
...because the next morning was September 11, 2001. So we weren't talking about our editor anymore that day, or for many days afterward.
Next morning I was on phone, telling our agent what had happened, asking what we shld do. Then said, Wait, something's going on outside...
I felt jealous of my coauthor for our editor's "attraction" &amp; idiotic for feeling jealous when it was just hazing all around.
I felt as talentless as the editor - who had only read what we'd written together, who didn't know who'd written what - had suggested.
Why were we shaken? Because we'd been bullied &amp; we'd taken it, for the sake of a book deal. We still had the book deal. I felt like a loser.
The night ended. I had to catch a train to DC very early. We'd talk about it the next day. We were both, I think, shaken.
By then we were pretty drunk, too. We'd started putting it away when the "joking" started. We did not know what to do.
He tried to be reassuring. He told me he knew I was a writer, too. He told my coauthor he was more than just his lips.
Finally, maybe after an hr, one of us--cant remember who first--told him to stop it. It wasn't cool. He was too drunk. He doubled down.
We were, after all, writing a book subtitled A Heretic's Bible. We didn't want to seem like prudes! &amp;, he could kill our deal.
I don't think we ever thought our editor was "serious." But he didn't let his "joke" go for a long time. At first, we tried to laugh it off.
...the divide according to which I was the "Jewish businessman" - not a writer - &amp; my (gentile) coauthor was the talent. To be pimped.
Our editor was Jewish, too, so maybe he thought that made it ok. Maybe in another context. Not then. Worse, though, was the divide...
It got worse. Our editor kept coming back to his "joke." Only now he said he'd arrange the $$ w/ me, since I was the Jew.
We were stunned. We didn't know what to say. Was this just how editors talked? We didn't want him to think we were homophobic. So we nodded.
Then he said, no, seriously, he could get us more money. For a blowjob. Again he said, "I'm joking!"
Then our editor told us he could get us more money for our book--if my coauthor gave him a blowjob. We were stunned. "I'm joking!" he said.
Then our editor said to my coauthor something like, "You have gorgeous lips. Is that inappropriate to say?"
We were both insulted. He was calling me smart but not an artist. He thought my coauthor was pretty but dumb. He didn't know a damn thing.
Our editor said to me, "I think you take care of business. &amp; you"--I believe he may have put a hand on my coauthor's leg--"do the writing."
Our editor was very drunk. 1st, he divided my coauthor &amp; me. "You're very mystical," he told my coauthor. To me he said, "you're practical."
The editor was smart &amp; enthusiastic, &amp; there we were, drinking w/ an editor - *our* editor! - in NYC. Then he started "joking."
The day I sold my 1st book, Killing the Buddha, my coauthor and I went out for drinks w/ our editor. We were so excited! Big break, right?
Which reminds me of a story that's been gnawing at me for weeks. Or, I mean, years.

...&amp; as such, it suits the contemporary establishment liberal imagination of evangelicalism. One that ignores complex realities.
But even so. Not only are black people largely missing; so, mostly, are everyday evangelicals. It's top-down history, all leaders...
I don't fault the judges, who are likely not familiar w/ American religious history. If a Pulitzer winner says this is how it was, well, ok.
Let me make that plainer: It's 900 pg history of that most American current of American religion, &amp; it scarcely mentions black people.
In adherence to outdated scholarly &amp;, sadly, still current journalistic conventional wisdom on evangelicals, Fitzgerald sees only whiteness.
But that'd be so what - maybe it's not such a great book, so it goes - were it's not what else is missing in 900 pages: Black people.
...It is a gathering of outdated, top-down, Great Man history, mostly absent the reporting that made her earlier work so valuable...
...I've even taught her work from 70s &amp; 80s on evangelicalism. This book, 900 pgs+, *looks* like an opus. It's not.
...but it leads to books like Frances Fitzgerald's The Evangelicals making the short list. I'm an admirer of Fitzgerald, too...

@claire_rudy 1 function of that hierarchy is even a midlist fiction writer can easily publish beginner NF for a buck. NF writers can't do that w/ fic.
@claire_rudy No, not at all &amp; I rarely have.w/ next book am *wildly* out of lane. My objection is to the hierarchy of poetry, fiction, NF, in that order.
@claire_rudy First, there's the editor. Then, yes -- as a writer, I recognize my mediocre fiction doesn't need to be read, even if I can publish it.
@claire_rudy This is spurred by a fiction writer I like commenting that she writes NF when waiting for ideas because NF is “easy to do quick.”
@claire_rudy Most MFAs reinforce the hierarchy &amp; notion that NF is lesser work any fiction writer or poet can knock off on side. It’s pretty insulting.

Hitchens said extremely bigoted things in my presence. Yes, he was a bigot. https://t.co/GHNGcjnO2X
@LarryLevitsky As I said, I'm speaking of early Didion, not Political Fictions (a much lesser book). Slouching is actual conservatism, not political.

Rightwingers castigating liberals for not speaking up about Weinstein, "an open secret." So why weren't rightwingers talking?

@OLAASM Sometimes no, sometimes yes. It's possible to revere the Panther legacy &amp; acknowledge that a lot of assholes got on board.

@Turtlebox She was! Who is this? DM me?
@nybooks ...not meaning to is not enough.
@nybooks ...Because I won't pass on that inheritance, that awful white American DNA of the "Lost Cause." My parents didn't mean to, but...
@nybooks ...If you're a parent or a teacher, ask yourself whether your kids know these words. Mine don't. They will.
...Lee's cowardice was evil, &amp; he only deepened it after the war, giving voice to the lie of the "Lost Cause." There can be no dispute...
...but he did what was wrong. Grievously, murderously, treasonously wrong. This isn't the definition of tragic. It's the definition of evil.
...even if were to allow the historical falsehood that he was opposed to slavery, he was a coward. Suppose he knew what was right...
...Lee was a coward most of all measured against the very lie that held him up as a hero, as a man devoted to principle...
...(tho he certainly did not hate it), but because he lacked the moral courage to stand agnst his family and his clan." Lee was a coward...
...which was that Robert E. Lee was a coward. W.E.B. Du Bois put it plain: "Lee followed VA not because he particularly loved slavery...
...but I wonder, now, how easy it wld have been for my classmates &amp; I to see Lee for what he was had we simply observed the obvious...
...the thing Dukes of Hazzard, &amp; my teachers, did not name: slavery; racism; the rotten heart of the American story, our original sin...
...Look, tho, how I've let my story go astray. Made it about betrayals of white people of their past, insted of what it was always about...
...rechristened traitors by their descendants, traitors themselves to their own past, w/ their rebel flags on what was once Union ground.
...in VT, where I live. In Colorado, I was once directed to what I was told was a Confederate cemetery. But the dead were Union...
...When I go back to Upstate NY now, I see the Confederate flag I once saw only on TV on flagpoles &amp; trucks &amp; t-shirts. I see it, too...
...the lie of the "Lost Cause" runs so deep in American culture. In many senses, it is American culture.
...in which John Wayne &amp; the other heroes were so often veterans of the Lost Cause, seeking in the West the justice denied them back home...
...They had been raised on these myths themselves, embedded in some of the strongest 20th century American myths of all, the Westerns...
...&amp; because it seemed a gentler path (they didnt ask for whom), by which our history (they didnt ask whose) cld be one of reconciliation...
...decades of white scholars whose ideas had trickled down to everyday education. &amp; because Hollywood thought it, Bo &amp; Luke &amp; Uncle Jesse...
...That Gen Lee was a good man &amp; the Civil War was "complicated." They thought this, in part, because historians thought it...
...This isn't a story about Mississippi,. It's about Democrats in Upstate NY who "accidentally" raised their kids to believe...
...the unspoken racism and segregation of our little northern town, increasingly wary of the black people who lived across the river...
...where we learned the Civil War wasn't "really" about slavery. This was introduced as a kind of sophistication. It sat easily with...
...Anyway, we moved on from 3rd grade (might've been 4th) w/ Lee imprinted as an archetype of principle. Didn't revisit til HS...
I'm glad I liked Grant more. Then again, I didn't really like my town much -- lot of bullies -- so I didn't get Lee's loyalty to place...
...just like the Dukes of Hazzard.
...Our homes being pure Yankee, of course, upstate NY. But the Lee we encountered transcended specifics of North &amp; South...
...Lee, we were led to believe, hated slavery but nobly led Confederate troops because he loved his home more. Didn't we love our homes? ...
...We read Civil War books for kids &amp; thought Lee *more* virtuous than Grant, because *Lee* fought for principle. That's what we thought...
...3rd grade conventional wisdom was that Lee was def. cooler. I liked Grant because he seemed like an underdog. Lee was too perfect...
...we had to write biography reports. A lot of boys chose Civil War generals. I and others chose Grant. Several kids chose Lee...
...we didn't really learn what the Confederacy really stood for in our pretty-good public school, either. But in third grade...
...she watched Dukes of Hazzard right along with us. I think she tsk-tsked the General Lee, but I don't remember her explaining...
...our mother was a Tennessean, left daughter of left union organizer, had worked at the radical anti-racist Highlander Folk School. But...
...because we shld have known what the Confederate flag, and what "General Lee," really stood for. Our mother shld have told us...
...then again, we knew no more about the "Lost Cause" than we understood that our equally beloved Narnia was evangelical. Not excusing...
...Only Confederate flag I saw then was on roof of General Lee, Bo &amp; Luke's car on Dukes of Hazzard. My sister &amp; I loved the Dukes...
I grew up in Scotia, NY, a nearly all-white working class town dominated by G.E. in neighboring (blacker, poorer) Schenectady...

RT @lizapierce: @sullivanamy @Davie_St I cared after I read The Family by @JeffSharlet
I'm sensitive to fact these points may be painful for qualified legacies. But not nearly as painful as the attack on affirmative action.
I've never heard a white legacy say she was asked how it felt to know she may have gotten in only because of parents.
Ive heard from many students of color who've been asked by white peers how it feels to know they might have gotten in because of race.
So if a white applicant thinks someone's unfairly getting her seat at her school of choice, she may be right: a wealthier white person.
Indeed. I've met some Flounders in my day, wealthy legacies w/ little academic aptitude, less interest, &amp; weak high school records. https://t.co/87ZEUh22lS
Not to mention the massive pro-white "affirmative action" of unequal secondary school funding &amp; de facto housing segregation.
Then there are those, like Jared Kushner, whose college admission may be related to their parents' "giving" -- aka, bribes.
This isn't to say that all legacies are unqualified! Most are. But every prof has had students who likely wouldn't have gotten in otherwise.
Such legacy admissions -- beneficiaries of a much uglier affirmative action -- tend to be overwhelmingly white and affluent.
At Dartmouth, where I teach, &amp; other elite schools, legacy admissions often account for more than 10% of the student body.
"Legacy admissions" are those in which the fact that a parent or relative went to the school, not merit, helps get the applicant in.
Given Trump admin's concern about "unfair" college admissions policies, I look forward to their crackdown on legacy admissions.

And you can't give up economic justice for 1/2 the population without abandoning it all together. What does that leave?
Democrats who sell out reproductive rights aren't just abandoning women's health. They're giving up commitment to economic justice, too.
Reproductive rights are not a "single issue." They're about health, equality, economics, labor, family, values, &amp; the biggest life choices.
@ParkerTRichards No, they indicate petty obsessions (rooted in legitimate ideological critiques) that derail larger legit work of Wikileaks.

Raising more questions than you answer is how power's lies work. It's why power's lies work.
When we tell ourselves Trump is going down because his lies contradict themselves, we create the petri dish in which they thrive. 7/7
The way Trump lies works not because he's clever but because it's like a mutation of democracy that's found its moment. 6/
Trump's no evil genius of obfuscation. He's a compulsive liar. He is an evolutionary response to broken democracy. 5/
This is how authoritarian regimes work. By hook or by crook. It doesn't mean they know what they're doing; they just do it anyway. 4/
The point isn't to make you believe any one lie; it's make you uncertain which lie is the one you dispute. 3/
Authoritarian regimes don't displace the truth with one lie; they do it with many, often contradictory lies. 2/

@noraconnor One doesn't need to read awful JD Vance to recognize that Democratic Party depended on poor base &amp; upper middle class elites.
Apparently stat quoted by Remnick, in interview w/ Elizabeth Warren, on only 493 wealthiest counties voting HRC may be false.
@markwby Indeed. But mightn't we ask some questions of the New Yorker, then?
@pritchard33 No it doesn't. It accuses the party elites of being neoliberal, unable to expand sufficiently beyond betrayed base.
David Remnick, EiC, New Yorker: "every one of the 493 wealthiest counties... voted for Clinton. The remaining 2,623... voted for Trump."
@StacyDVanDeveer Who are you talking to? Not me.
@pritchard33 Yes. yes. That's true. And *still.* or, you could just insist the Democratic Party is doing great!
@StacyDVanDeveer So quoted by Remnick. Who I thought a reliable source.
@markwby Well that is interesting. Is the New Yorker full of shit on this?
@markwby Could be. I'm quoting David Remnick and the failing New Yorker. &amp; noted rightwing polemicist Elizabeth Warren.

@pritchard33 In a neoliberal nation "educated" has become a marker of wealth. As it ever was, really.
@fogliz Since when did wealth -- or elite education -- correlate with passion for social and environmental justice?
@Hernan_Pisano The New Yorker.
@StacyDVanDeveer Yes. I do think a party that can only win wealthy counties is probably doing something wrong. &amp; it's def not winning.
@kyjlue I voted for her, too. Are you suggesting corporatist Democratic politics have been a winning strategy? Or, you know, good for human beings?
493 wealthiest counties voted Clinton. The other 2600 bought Trump's fake populism. No stat more damning of Democratic corporatism.

@mvjennings @RamonVillalobos But what wld he moderate? Not Trump's nativism. Only those aspects of his economics that were populist.
@mvjennings @RamonVillalobos Whether you find those views reasonable or not, inaccurate to describe them as centrist. It's political spin. Most claims of centrism are.
@mvjennings @RamonVillalobos Point being that by "moderate" press really means economic views that dominate the (tiny) upper &amp; upper middle class.
@mvjennings @RamonVillalobos I'm no fan of Hamilton. But yes, Goldman Sachs is considerably more extreme in its economic vision than vast majority.
