@BernieSanders Nickel hydride batteries are responsible for higher sulfur oxide emissions, roughly 22 pounds (10 kilograms) per hybrid compared with 2.2 pounds (about 1 kilogram) for a conventional vehicle [sources: Samaras and Burnham et al].
@BernieSanders Both nickel-hydride batteries and the newer lithium-ion batteries rely on the mining of nickel, copper and so-called rare earth metals. The production of lithium-ion batteries account for 2 to 5 percent of total lifetime hybrid emissions.
@BernieSanders Toyota admits that the production of its lightweight Prius requires more energy and emits more carbon dioxide than the production of its gas-only models [source: Williams].
@BernieSanders Your jealousy of oil executives is showing. Wind energy kills a quarter of 1 million birds annually in the US. It‚Äôs noisy and it‚Äôs a visual eye sore destroying many landscapes. The solar farm in the Mojave Desert killed 30,000 birds last year. And that‚Äôs just one farm.
