@TomiLahren Maybe it’s because a majority Muslim district. So it only makes sense both of your statements would be true. Dumbass.
@GOPChairwoman @Jim_Jordan Says the guy who looked the other way when college kids were getting molested
@charliekirk11 Right, because you have so much talent. The only talent you have is being an asshole on Twitter
@bennyjohnson @dbongino @TPUSA You should be the one to talk about fake stories. Pretty sure you made your name on them. Jackass.
@dbongino I almost wanted to buy this book to use the pages to wipe my ass, but then I remembered I would be putting money in your pocket.
@charliekirk11 You do realize only one of these people are still in Government, right? Jackass.
@charliekirk11 Yes @charliekirk11 a kid who had someone chant is face is completely comparable to students who had multiple classmates murdered. Jackass
@dbongino @dbongino calling someone an opportunist has to be the funniest thing to happen on Twitter all day
@charliekirk11 Someone watched Sean Hannity tonight
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Politicians flip flopping? No way! Keep losing elections, you’ll be fired in no time.
@aseavey20 @TPUSA @kimguilfoyle @DonaldJTrumpJr @charliekirk11 @RealCandaceO @KatiePavlich @DineshDSouza @RubinReport And I actually have no idea who @RubinReport is, so I’ll give him a pass.
@aseavey20 @TPUSA @kimguilfoyle @DonaldJTrumpJr @charliekirk11 @RealCandaceO @KatiePavlich @DineshDSouza @RubinReport Isn’t this the biggest group of assholes ever assembled (besides Gutfeld, Pavlich, and Peterson, you cool.)
@charliekirk11 @DonaldJTrumpJr God, I can’t wait until your irrelevant again.
@charliekirk11 Says the guy born in 1993. Jackass
@SebGorka @DanCrenshawTX @nbcsnl @nbc Why are you such an asshole all the time? You’re not even American.
@RealCandaceO @taylorswift13 @Oprah @Diddy @rihanna Pot calling the kettle black. Wouldn’t you say? Keep trying to get famous, Candace. No one is going to care about you once Trump is gone.
@RealCandaceO @taylorswift13 @Oprah Celebrities that disagree with you can’t endorse anybody! But when one celebrity embraces what you think you shamelessly exploit them to become more famous! Candace Owens, ladies and gentlemen!
@RealCandaceO @taylorswift13 @Oprah What are you talking about? What do you tell black people to do every day with their vote on this very platform? You’re a clown.
@BillSimmons Ahh the steroids were strong that day
@RealSaavedra @dbongino Hey @dbongino the Republicans have only won the popular vote once?since 1988, jackass. I can’t wait until Trump is gone and no one will care what you have to say and you go back to being a professional election loser.
RT @jadande: That Hopkins run deserves all of the Chris Berman “Whooop! Whoop!s” Can we bring back a special old school NFL Prime Time?
I almost feel bad for David Price at this point..
@RealCandaceO @amyschumer Cool, try to call out famous people so you can get more famous.
That’s what why the Yankees signed Giancarlo
LET’S GO https://t.co/GHbPLF8caa
@RealCandaceO Great! I thought judges are supposed to be partial and unbiased! Your tweets are more and more ridiculous. I’m looking forward to the day when no one cares what you and @charliekirk11 have to say. Probably sometime after the next election.
@RealCandaceO @LanaDelRey @ChrisEvans This is clearly a recruiting tool you and @charliekirk11 think is going to work to recruit black people to vote Republican. Good luck with that one. It isn’t working.
@RealCandaceO @LanaDelRey @ChrisEvans @RealCandaceO what are you talking about? You’re putting words in people’s mouths. Anyone who actually believes that what he is saying isn’t intelligent, which I know you are.
RT @minakimes: fitzpatrick is jeopardizing his rookie of the year campaign
Conte just got steam rolled
@Jared_Carrabis Right because they didn’t lose 10-1 or anything
@RealCandaceO Sure, let’s just discredit without hearing what they have to say. I don’t remember this happening with Gorsuch
@charliekirk11 Because Kansas and Nebraska are thriving economic centers
Of course I’m playing AJ Green in two leagues this week.
@dbongino Funny, coming from a guy who supports Trump
Right wing twitter is pretty silent on this whole Trump, fake death toll tweet. Where you at @charliekirk11 @RealCandaceO @dbongino
@dbongino Weird. I’m pretty sure you post crazy right wing outrage campaigns every day on Twitter.
@charliekirk11 How’d long it take you to figure that one out?
RT @joshtpm: What happened here when President Trump tried twice to pronounce "anonymous"? https://t.co/nwSNnQuKfm
This person should watch my next tweet https://t.co/sMVrdqcfer
@charliekirk11 For someone who says liberals hate America, you post a lot of tweets like this bashing it. You’re just a clown who plays to the Trump base. But hey, it’s get you a Judge Jeanine every week and some money!
@charliekirk11 @MeghanMcCain What are you talking about? She said, ‘the America does not need to be great again.’ Way to leave the whole first part of the quote out! Do you believe what you say? Or are you aiming to be the next Sean Hannity. You are what’s wrong with America today.
@charliekirk11 @TheOfficerTatum Yes, considering they started while Obama was President. Nice try though, Chuck.
Ain’t that the truth https://t.co/f7dDFmcEi3
Let’s go, Tiger
@charliekirk11 But Russia didn’t influence any actual votes. Kind of arguing against yourself, bro
@IAmSuperTrump @MaggieJordanACN @SheilaDRobinso2 @realDonaldTrump Hahaha this has to be the funniest thing I’ve ever seen. Family man? Trust worthy? Man of faith?
Didn’t @realDonaldTrump support Roy Moore? https://t.co/RTxRY9kdVb
And GW barely squeaked by in ‘04 https://t.co/Ao9fm955wb
Amateur night @ the Apollo https://t.co/bvVDXuPJmg
I agree with the right wingers that to this point, there is no evidence of Trump collusion with Russia. Having said that, it is awfully strange how obedient he is to all things Russia. I think the tape is real. #peetape
@TheCrossover I like DeRozan a lot, but if he’s your best player, they’re heading towards 45 wins and a first round exit in the West.
Defending Trump has to be the hardest job in America. But @PressSec PressSec is very good at her job. When she can’t even come up with a plausible explanation to what he says, that’s when you know he has reached a new level of bullshit.
Kawhi doesn’t play for the Raptors, calling it now.
@ABC @CeciliaVega It’s embarrassing to watch this White House try and cover for the presidents lies.
@RealCandaceO At the core of a Trump supporter is blind loyalty no matter what he says or does, even if it means going against everything you stood for pre Trump. See how easy that is? Go home.
@charliekirk11 You’re absolutely insane with the bull shit you spew. I don’t even really think you believe it. I think you’re trying to line yourself up to be the next Sean Hannity. Good for you, make some money, but it’s people like you who are ruining the political discourse in this country.
@Chet_Cannon Yes, pull up quotes that happened before they meddled in a election. Good for you, Chet! You really showed them. Please be on the next spaceship to Kolob.
@Chet_Cannon You’re an asshole. The fact that you’re a Mormon means you instantly lose all intellectual credibility. Go to Kolob ASAP, please.
@dbongino You’re an idiot. How you continue to get on TV is ridiculous. I don’t actually support democratic socialism, but what you’re saying has zero truth. So keep spewing it to you’re ‘useful idiots.’
@ainsleyearhardt @dbongino @foxandfriends That is not what being a democratic socialist is. I don’t support the idea of being a democratic socialist, but again this idiot is spewing lies and propaganda. How this jerk off gets on TV is beyond me.
@Chet_Cannon Says the guy who supports Trump on here everyday
@BillOReilly Don’t you have some women to sexually harass
@charliekirk11 You’re a clown.
@charliekirk11 Why do you always look like your about to poop yourself?
@Chet_Cannon Breaking: no one cares what you have to say. Go back to Kolob
@parscale Fact:	You’re full of shit.
@Chet_Cannon Can you just go to Kolob already?
@Chet_Cannon I think you’re officially the biggest idiot on all of the internet. Stick to ‘The Challenge.’
@Chet_Cannon Credibility? Coming from you? That’s funny, you’re just stating things with absolutely zero evidence. Go back to the real world.
@Chet_Cannon @GeorgeTakei @Chet_Cannon Could you generalize anymore? Find two signs from 2005 and post it as fact. Didn’t you literally do this to @davidhogg111 the other day about posting one obscure event? Ex reality star, turned political hack.
@Chet_Cannon When did you become a political commentator? Don’t you have real world road rules challenge to be on?
