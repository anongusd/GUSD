McCarthy's finniest line: Dick Cheney is looking forward to being retired and waterboarding his grandchildren.
McCarthy: "there was so much pork in the stimulus bill, even Michael Moore couldn't finish it."
Rep. McCarthy: I would be remiss if I didn't have tom daschle to thank for our limo service.
McCarthy has a very very tough act to follow in Klobuchar
Klobuchar jokes about Purple Tunnel of Doom: "So much for Democrats being against torture."
Klobuchar to congressional reporters: All of you were scooped by the Nat'l Inquirer on the John Edwards story.
Amy Klouchar, definitely getting belly laughs here at the dinner. Much at Rahm's expense.
Klobuchar: I raised $17,000 from ex-boyfriends. Barney Frank holds that record in the House.
Klobuchar: I'm up here telling the jokes and Al Franken is going to be senator. What's wrong with this picture?
Candy Crowley introduces Sen Klobuchar as the senior senator, the only senator from Minnesota
More speaker: Rahm's email address is "Bleep bleep bleep at whitehouse.com"
Pelosi jokes Obama's email address is: "I'm all ears at whitehouse.com."
Pelosi: times are so tough, when the NYT calls, Geithner doesn't know whether it's a press call or a request for a bailout.
Best speech ever, just given by Nan Robertson: "All I have to say is, thank you from the bottom of my heart."
Due to late votes, the Post table is missing Sens. Alexander and Isakson. But we have the Silver Fox: Steny Hoyer.
Freshman Rep. Dan Maffei to Rahm Emanuel: I promise I'm raising money.
Sen. Klobuchar's husband, John Bessler, promises "Amy will be funny."
