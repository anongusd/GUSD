@ewarren I'd like to see you work toward changing tax laws.  This year, my husband and I are getting a tax refund less than half of what last year's was. This was because we got less than half the amount of Earned Income Tax Credit, due to my husband's employer reducing his hours.
@CNN The question of the day ....why didn't the child's parents take him to the doctor ?
@SenSanders You nailed it, Bernie. How about you run in 2020 ?
@realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr @SenJohnKennedy The majority of Americans no longer want the wall because @POTUS  lied when he promised he was going to make Mexico pay for it.  Spend $5 billion on more drones, drug dogs, and more patrols, but don't build a wall
@RBReich @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @SenJohnKennedy @senatemajldr  Just confirmed NO SNAP BENEFITS IN MARCH IF SHUTDOWN CONTINUES. WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE ? NOW YOUR STARVING CHILDREN &amp;ELDERLY &amp;DISABLED PEOPLE  Read whole article &amp;retweet !!!https://t.co/ETkf7Fw0Zx

@FBIAgentsAssoc @nycsouthpaw @tfoconnor83 What happens if the government remains shut down for months or even years ? What if the people not getting paid just quit because they need jobs that bring in money not just IOUs ? I doubt anyone else will apply to take their place because no one will work for free for long.
@USATODAY Covering a work of art is not going to change history. What next ? Stop teaching history classes just because some people don't like what happened ?
@RepSusanWild @POTUS  Things are fixing to get a whole lot worse if the shut downs continues https://t.co/M2lYOKsTVd
@gbennettpost @RepLoisFrankel @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr  This is just the tip of the iceberg.  The government shutdown is going to destroy the country. https://t.co/M2lYOKsTVd
@nytimes Sorry New York Times, due to the government shut down, I can't afford it.
@AnnCoulter @POTUS President Trump also promised Mexico would be paying for the wall. Since Mexico is not paying, the majority of Americans no longer want the wall.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ We're not going to have much of a country to protect,if the shutdown continues. Immigration will cease to be a problem because life will be better in a 3rd world country than in the USA....https://t.co/M2lYOKsTVd
@realDonaldTrump It won't be for long, if you don't end the shutdown now. https://t.co/M2lYOKsTVd
@MartinHeinrich Things are about to get a whole lot worse than that. Think about this.....https://t.co/M2lYOKsTVd
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @POTUS @senatemajldr  You're wasting your time on this, when dooms day is about to happen to millions of Americans because of the shutdown.  An eighth grader could do a better job than you guys.  https://t.co/M2lYOKsTVd
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Reality check. Those workers who are not getting paid are facing dire situations.  Quite a number of them can not afford needed medication Many can't afford groceries, rent, mortgage, car payments, or even gas to get to work That's not winning. What happens when they quit?
@WhiteHouse @POTUS @senatemajldr  Republicans have stopped caring about American's safety. The shutdown is causing more safety risks than illegal immigration. TSA calling out in record numbers, recession looming, people going to starve when SNAP doesn't go out in March #REPUBLICANSOUTIN2020
@birdona64702725 @ctmlaw @matthewschmitz @julie_kelly2 When they first arrived the Native American ceremony was taking place, The kids interrupted it by being loud and yelling stuff. Then, they blocked the ceremony progression, then they were approached. If the kids had been quit and respectful, then no problem.
@marklevinshow If @POTUS really actually cared about border security, you'd think he'd be paying border patrol agents, now. However, with the shutdown, that is not happening. What happens if all unpaid federal workers just quit cause they need paying jobs where they actually get money.
@sendavidperdue @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr  President Trump showed no regard for countless Americans that the government shutdown is badly hurting. People are going to be hurting even worse soon. Now Tax refunds delays https://t.co/CvmGDcPYwC

@ctmlaw @matthewschmitz @julie_kelly2 I agree. The students were at fault.
@ellievan65 I hope the general public remembers who these kids are. If I were an employer, I wouldn't want to hire them. Too much of a liability risk.  If I were in college admissions, I'd turn them down for the same reason.
@h8Wankmaggot45 Moonshine.  Try Tim Smith's he finally went legal, so you can now buy it.

@SteveZemke @RepKimSchrier I agree. #OUTWITHALLREPUBLIACNSIN2020

@realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich NO WAY ARE YOU MY FAVORITE PRESIDENT, YOU SUCK AT THE JOB. GOOD PRESIDENTS DO NOT SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT &amp; PUT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS IN SERIOUS FINANCIAL PERIL.
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Unfortunately that is not going to happen unless Trump gives up the wall. Most Americans do not want it now because Trump lied or misled the public into thinking Mexico was paying for it. #OUTWITHALLREPUBLICANSIN2020
@senatemajldr @POTUS Trump's "solution" is not a solution at all. The majority of Americans no longer want a wall along our border because Trump lied and promised Mexico was going to pay for it when the reality is Mexico isn't paying. Trump &amp; Mitch need to look at the polls and give up on the wall.

@Bornabrit1 I agree. I vow never again to vote for another Republican. No Way.
@michelleconlin @kristinacooke @POTUS @realdonaldtrump Well....we don't need the wall at all just send this story everywhere....it will keep most illegals out. Who wants to starve and wipe their own butt with their fingers.....nobody Problem solved. Reopen government..
@realDonaldTrump There will be thousands of women that become unemployed when they are forced to quit their government jobs because they can't exist without money in order to search for other jobs,,,,.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I hope this means you will be ending the shutdown by declaring a national emergency about the wall, if not, I will not vote for another Republican again for any office ever. You started the shutdown, you end it.
@jenbice10573 @lisamurkowski @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi  @realDonaldTrump  What is going to happen when someone dies because they can't afford needed medication due to the shutdown ? What happens when SNAP benefits aren't issued and kids start going hungry and getting sick ? The shutdown is messing with people's health.
@lisamurkowski @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr @SpeakerPelosi  Those people will only get paid if the government shutdown ends. How many of those workers or their families are going to get sick and need medicine they can't afford ? Flu season is here. Flu can kill without proper medication.
@realDonaldTrump No one gives a f-ck about Schumer. Everyone wants an end to the government shut down.  What happens when federal workers or their loved ones start dying because they have no money for needed medication or medical care ?  Wrongful death lawsuits ?
@ABC @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi  President Trump your wall wouldn't have stopped this.....
@washingtonpost A WALL IS NOT WORTH STARVING WOMEN, CHILDREN, &amp; THE ELDERLY &amp; RISKING THEM GETTING EVICTED BECAUSE OF THE SHUTDOWN.
@washingtonpost @washingtonpost  Ann Coulter is a heartless b-tch who doesn't care that the shutdown means that great numbers of people can't afford rent, medicine, or even food. She doesn't care that I can't even afford a birthday gift for my son because of the shutdown.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi  A "wall" is not the answer to border security. All a wall will do is send more people to boats or planes in Canada, then cross into my state, VT Why not spend 5 billion on hiring more patrol agents and more training and tech for them.....
@POTUS  @realDonaldTrump  Another reason you need to end the government shutdown you started . https://t.co/95j82dPtga
@realDonaldTrump President Trump, I bet those countries aren't dumb enough to shut down their governments and seriously endanger hundreds of thousands of families to do so. The majority of Americans no longer want the wall or want anything to do with it because Mexico ain't paying.
@realDonaldTrump Seriously, if the government shut down continues most in the USA won.t give a f-ck about border security. Adults find it hard to care about a wall when your shutdown is starving their families and putting them at risk of losing their cars and homes.  The shutdown is your fault.
@senatemajldr Your first priority should be to open the government any way possible because it is hurting Americans more than it is helping them. Govt worker without paycheck can't afford needed medication, food, rent, mortgage, car payments, etc. No one gives a f-ck about Syria now.
@POTUS  What happens when all the TSA agents quit because they aren't getting paid ? What happens when no one wants to work for the govt because of fear of not getting paid ?
@timothyrhoman @Jordanfabian @scottwongDC @POTUS If the Democrats attend, Trump still won't reopen the govt. The sorry excuse for a human that is our President doesn't give a f-ck about the people that his shutdown hurts  Our own President is hurting more people at one time than illegal immigration ever would.
@SenCortezMasto @amyklobuchar Seriously,  that is not going to matter with the gov shutdown. What are seniors going to do when HUD can't pay their landlords and they get evicted ? What is going to happen to them when SNAP does not go out in March ?
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr  I am so ashamed of the whole Republican Party, right now. Especially Trump and the Sen Majority Leader.  I can no longer support anyone who would shutdown the govt and put Americans at risk of serious harm. https://t.co/3xgBsyfa2b

@NBCNews Way to brag about the food you can afford to buy, while federal workers are being forced to go to food banks and millions of Americans are scared that they won't get SNAP benefits in March due to the shut down.  What a lack of class. Tasteless move. Isn't good for your image.
@NBCNews I find Trump showed a decided lack of empathy with this stunt. Thousands of federal workers are turning to food banks due to the shut down and can't even afford to buy fast food. NOT COOL.
@lisamurkowski I agree cancel recess.
@jonlovett If the government shut down continues, millions of Americans will lose SNAP benefits in March, and you have the gall to tweet about hamburgers when citizens are worried about potentially starving. NOT COOL
@siano2020 They all suck.
@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump  I can tell you why people who are working are not getting paid. It's because of YOU . You shut the govt down and have placed a lot of Americans in harms way over a stupid wall.
@ABC @POTUS @ABC  Trump doesn't give a f-ck about American safety. If he did he would not have shut down the govt. How safe are people going to be when they are homeless because their rent or mortgage is not paid ? How safe are they going to be when SNAP dries up and they are starving
@odysey215 @HouseGOP @RepRalphNorman They aren't going to. Govt doesn't give a damn about Vermonters or any other American that is effected by the shutdown.
@HouseGOP @RepRalphNorman No American is going to care about border security if people start starving due to no SNAP benefits being issued in March, or elderly and disabled people on Section 8 end up evicted because govt didn't pay landlords. Think lots more homeless and hungry people in the streets...
@realDonaldTrump People are not going to care about border security if they are starving because SNAP benefits do not go out in March or if they are made homeless because landlords did not get Section 8 payments,  Republicans will not like 2020 results if govt is shutdown much longer.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Gas prices still are not low enough. Before Hurricane Katrina hit, my husband and I were paying $1.58 per gallon. Today, price of gas was $2.58 per gallon.  Lower gas prices won't be enough to save the Americans suffering hardship due to the shutdown you created.
@Tim_Roemer @SpeakerPelosi @RepDeanPhillips @RepDerekKilmer @ElaineLuriaVA All that doesn't amount to a hill of beans with the government shut down and Americans facing severe hardship because of it.
@SpeakerPelosi I have the solution to the shutdown. Why can't Congress up the date of the 2020 election until 2019 ? The Rep can run on keep shutdown and go for wall, Dems run on open govt and no wall but some more money for border security. We know who would be out of there....
@realDonaldTrump This is not fake news. This is story is real. https://t.co/mmWEuiPSB7
https://t.co/mmWEuiPSB7
@SenSanders Small businesses won't be able to afford to pay workers that much and will cut jobs or reduce workers hours so they do not have to pay benefits. When the minimum wage went up in VT, a lot of places cut hours to just 10 hours a week per employee.
@realDonaldTrump Nobody cares about Syria while the govt is shut down. Too many Americans are worried about how they are going to feed their kids if March SNAP benefits don't go out and tax refunds are delayed. Since IRS workers won't be paid, they will start calling in sick delays will happen.
@Sueis4MAGAA @MartinHeinrich I know several federal workers who are not getting paid.  All are the sole income in their families. Two have spouses with terminal cancer and extremely high medical bills that have ate up any savings.
@justcallmecovfe @MartinHeinrich Most states are sending Feb SNAP benefits out early in Jan, but are telling people March benefits may not be issued if the shutdown continues.
@MommaRae4 @MartinHeinrich Vermont is already telling SNAP recipients that March benefits may not be issued if the shutdown continues
@MartinHeinrich It's too bad that there will be no SNAP benefits after Feb if the shutdown continues....lots of people including children are going to starve, but Trump wants it that way. Think Hitler, Mussolini, etc. History repeats itself....
@realDonaldTrump The fact that nearly 1 million Americans have no income due to the shutdown is not fake news. Those families have rent or mortgages and car payments and utility bills and medical expenses. Most have little or no savings. That is not fake news. YOU ARE CAUSING HARM TO THOSE FOLKS.
@POTUS https://t.co/feWj2btvsq
@SenatorFischer  You need to beg McConnell to end this shut down. Millions of Americans stand to lose SNAP benefits for March and payments to landlords for Section 8 benefits if the shut down continues. A wall isn't worth starving women, children, and the disabled, and elderly.
@SenatorBaldwin Instead of speaking at the UAW, you should have been in Washington begging McConnell to end this shutdown before people lose March SNAP benefits and Section 8 payments.

@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews If you truly want to protect Americans, protect them from starvation and homelessness. End the shutdown now, if it continues SNAP benefits won't be issued for March. How do you explain to your kids that the President wants them to starve because he wants a wall ?
@RepDonBeyer There needs to be a lot of people calling McConnell's office demanding he grow a set and stand up to Trump and end this shutdown before millions of people starve to death because if the shutdown continues SNAP benefits won't be issued for March
@CBSNews Nobody really cares about Saudi Arabia when millions of Americans are going to face starvation when SNAP benefits do not go out in March and homelessness when landlords evict renters because Section 8 payments are not issued to landlords.
@realDonaldTrump End the shutdown now. It's time to abort the wall mission. Starving women, children, and the elderly is not worth it.  I've lost all respect for you and all Republicans. I am ashamed to call myself a Republican, now. I am now voting as a Democrat.

@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @JesseBWatters @greggutfeld Due to the shutdown, I have lost all respect for Republicans.  I can see right through Trump's plan. No SNAP benefits, No welfare, No Section 8. No Medicaid. That equals more deaths, less people to oppose his &amp; Putin's world takeover.  History repeats itself. Welcome back Hitler.

@SpeakerPelosi  Please do something to fund SNAP or end the shutdown, we just found out we will not get our March SNAP benefits, if the shutdown continues.  Please help us. https://t.co/LdjOUhdg8s
@POTUS My husband and I will never, again vote for another Republican candidate for any office if the shut down continues. We just found out we will not receive our SNAP benefits in March, if the shutdown continues. Starve elderly, disabled, and children and lose your supporters.

@SpeakerPelosi @SpeakerPelosi POTUS is not going to reopen the govt without you saying YES to his wall. GIVE HIM THE WALL NOW.  American lives are dependent on govt benefits like  SNAP and HUD housing assistance.  IMPEACH OR GIVE HIM WALL.
@writerdeanna @SenJohnKennedy I agree stop this at once and reopen govt.
@JoshuaGoble4 @SenJohnKennedy I agree.  We have fencing, now. Illegal immigrants just go under or over it.  Seriously, a wall of any type can be tunneled under or climbed over....even my middle school kid said that we need are more patrol officers armed with the latest tech like drones with heat sensors
@SenJohnKennedy Hey John,  the wall is not as important as my family being fed and housed. If SNAP benefits are ceased due to the shut down and tax refunds don't go out on time, our family will be homeless because we will be using rent money for food. OPEN GOVT or you Republicans wont win 2020.
@SpeakerPelosi @SpeakerPelosi  Please say YES to the wall and end the shutdown now.  We rely on SNAP to feed our family our tax refund helps pay our rent...Please Please Give POTUS his wall. The darn thing isn't as important as feeding and housing Americans.

@SenKevinCramer @POTUS NO, POTUS did not win. He is the one who shut down the govt. He is the one holding poor people hostage. He needs to command the Army to build the wall and open the government.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Please give POTUS his darn wall. The shutdown if it continues will cause SNAP benefits to end and tax refunds to be delayed. Our family's food budget is entirely SNAP benefits. Our income barely covers rent.  A wall is better than starving or being homeless.
@RepRaulGrijalva Border communities need Congress to give POTUS his darn wall to end the shutdown. If shutdown continues there will be no SNAP or no tax refunds. Without SNAP, my family would starve or end up homeless because we'd have to spend rent money for food.
@RepMGS Please work to give POTUS his wall. If the govt shutdown continues, our family will lose SNAP benefits. Our entire food budget is SNAP because our family's income just covers our rent. If we have to use rent money for food, we will be homeless.
@RepZoeLofgren  Please work to give POTUS his wall. If the shutdown continues, we will lose SNAP benefits. Our family depends on SNAP to be able to eat. It is our entire food budget, our income just barely covers rent. Don't starve us, Give him the wall, please.
@RepAndreCarson  Please give @POTUS his wall. If the govt stays closed, we will lose our SNAP benefits. If we lose SNAP, we will have no choice but to spend our rent money on food. Our lease says our landlord can evict if we are even just 1 week late with the rent.
@RepGutierrez  Please give @POTUS his wall. If the govt stays closed, we will lose our SNAP benefits. If we lose those, Our family will have to use our rent money for food. Our landlord will evict if we are just a week late with rent. Give him the wall. Quit holding us hostage.
@RepRaulGrijalva  Give Trump his wall. If the govt stays closed, we will lose our SNAP benefits. Without them, we will have to chose between food and rent. Holding the American people hostage over this is wrong. Give him the wall, I beg you.
@SenTedCruz  Please tell the president to reopen the govt. Our family depends on food stamps, if we don't get our benefits, we don't eat. Our tax refund goes toward our rent. If we don't have it before March, we will be homeless. Give him the darn wall.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, time is money. Quit wasting Americans time and money. You are commander in chief of the military. Order the Army or Marines to build the wall. They would do a better job on it than any private contractors would.  Open the govt.
@VermontFoodbank https://t.co/oibQ1fO8Ot  My family and I get SNAP because our income from Soc Sec is too low to pay rent and also buy food.  What can we do if we do not receive SNAP benefits in Feb.  ? Our local food shelf only allows us to use it once a month.
@POTUS This story came out in my local paper. Due to disability, I depend on SNAP to feed my family.  Apparently, my kids are going to be at risk of going hungry if your shutdown continues. I guess you don't care about the American people. https://t.co/oibQ1fO8Ot
@SpeakerPelosi  I know your party doesn't want to fund Trump's wall. However, the government shutdown is starting to seriously harm poor American families. Life threatening situations are close to developing. Give him the wall...people's lives are more important than politics.
@NBCNews President Trump doesn't care about the poor people in this country.  This  might be his  way to try to legally reduce the population. Think about it....people could get hurt or get sick and die in those situations where they don't get benefits...

@AP @POTUS  said Mexico was going to fund the wall. Apparently, he lied about that. Mexico isn't going to fund it, if he needs billions from our govt. The shut down will cause my family serious harm if it continues. Possibly making us choose between food and paying rent.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS If Mexico is paying for the wall, why do you need to hold the government and your supporters hostage with a govt shutdown, while you demand money for it.  Get Mexico to cut the check and stop forcing citizens to struggle without pay.....
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Job growth ? The only jobs available in my town are minimum wage, part-time 10 hour a week food service and retail jobs. You can't feed a family and pay rent on those wages. I have a job, but I have to rely on SNAP to feed us....I call BS on job growth.
@POTUS  Your govt shut down now may end up causing my family serious, possibly life threatening harm. Just heard that the shut down will cause our SNAP benefits to stop, if it continues beyond Feb.  Also heard tax refunds won't be issued. You need to be impeached.
