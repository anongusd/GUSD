If these substances are legal, why can't marijuana be as well? It doesn't cause a strong physical addiction like other substances, it doesn't induce violent behavior, it awakens creativity, it's completely natural, etc.   Another point is that I think the legalization of marijuana could put an end to the harmful effects of illegal trafficking. The war between drug cartels and police have caused way too many deaths worldwide. We have already seen the effects of prohibition on alcohol. When prohibition was lifted, there was less violence on the streets due to the fact that the trafficking stopped. Why can't we do the same with the trafficking situation between Mexico and the US?  I also think that the legalization of marijuana would be good for the economy. It would create a new work industry therefore more jobs available to the people.

And much less dangerous than driving while texting. Unlike you I am actually going to cite a study, by the United States Department of Transportation no less:  “This report concerns the effects of marijuana smoking on actual driving performance. … This program of research has shown that marijuana, when taken alone, produces a moderate degree of driving impairment which is related to consumed THC dose. The impairment manifests itself mainly in the ability to maintain a lateral position on the road, but its magnitude is not exceptional in comparison with changes produced by many medicinal drugs and alcohol. Drivers under the influence of marijuana retain insight in their performance and will compensate when they can, for example, by slowing down or increasing effort. As a consequence, THC’s adverse effects on driving performance appear relatively small.”  REFERENCE: W. Hindrik and J. Robbe and J. O’Hanlon. 1993. Marijuana and actual driving performance. Washington, DC: US Department of Transportation National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Report No. DOT HS 808 078.  I am by no means suggested that it should be legal to drive high. I am merely demonstrating another failure in your chain of logic.  Marijuana legalized =&gt; More people use marijuana =&gt; More people drive high =&gt; There will be many more deaths as a result  Hypothetically speaking even if marijuana was proven to cause as much driving impairment as alcohol, this would still not be grounds for it to be illegal. One of the most dangerous things to do while driving is sleeping. But it isn't illegal to stay up for three nights in a row which will make it very likely for you to fall asleep at the wheel.

If 'dangerous' is the over-all term for anything that might shunt one from his formal, initial, eligible state of his body. An imaginary state of fully-functioning, flawless, ideal body. Structured by psychology, biology, culture and all kinds of institutions, to distinguish sanity from lunacy, health from illness, intelligence from ignorance. Though these are not the bad guys, of course, it's just that marijuana does change you, it does change your body, the way you think, thus the dangerous mark is understandable.   The 'high' effect is an abnormal state that will never fit it with the standards. in fact, it changes people so much they often consider upper spiritual intervention and skip their way to the bible, only to find (or intentionally reinterpret) juicy quotes of Jesus puffing away - THESE are the bad guys. These people underestimate the abyss between themselves and the machine that produced the metaphors they use to explain their experience.   The data field of it's effects is radically shaped by the method of learning it, thus a non-user and a do-user are both biased, the argument between the two always hides the law underneath it, which separates them even more. The point is that some day the do-user won't have the need of such self-deceit, just like most of us manage to live without defying the meaning of life.  Stigma dissolving is not necessary, maybe not even possible, the stigma is not a merit of either side of the coin, it is the coin itself, the need to justify and 'OK' stamping one's inevitable position on either side demands the improvisation of rational evidence of truth.   Once a full legalization is executed, there might be a radical separation and a birth-approval for new culture, new moral, new rationalism that neutralizes the holiness around such a nihilistic notion of 'reasonable behavior', new thought, new language, new engagement with whatever is or is not considered reality. While the non-user will embrace the whole coin to morph it into a monopoly of the whole opinion spectrum within the data field of marijuana study, and will create yet another standard, unifying abstainers as much as absence of activity can be conceivable as a common denominator.   'Users' will consider the activity as we all consider sugar, it just won't be considered at all.

When someone gives up their free will by becoming a slave to a hard drug or prescription mood and personality altering chemicals it is time for society to step in and give them back control.  Marijuana may be a petty offender, much less of an offender than alcohol, tobacco, meth, cocaine..etc.., but it is still a means of giving up who you are or keeping yourself in a state of non-growth.   We, as human beings, have a duty to ourselves to grow, change, improve, but always in the context of who we are. Drugs are a way to retard this development, deny who we are, and cope with a world that rejects us. It is an escape; an escape which noone deserves.   I don't mind people escaping in other ways: video games, reading, television, camping..etc, at least they are still thinking, at least their self is still intact and operating.   When people do drugs they stop being people and start being Mr. or Ms. X+meth, or X+Marijuana, or X+alcohol. It isn't helpful; it's downright harmful in the long-run.   Governments and societies are meant to protect us; usually from dangers outside. This danger, this threat is unique in its internal, self-inflicted nature.   Again, Marijuana is only a petty offender in this case; which is why I am not adamant about its status as an illegal narcotic. There are far worse legal drugs which I am much more concerned with.   Does that help in explaining my objection to its use? I am still forming my opinion on this one so I know my logic is abit choppy and in some cases exaggerated.

Noone left me in charge, I have an opinion. We are all imposing our beliefs about what is best for ourselves and each other when engaging in democratic activity so I don't see the problem with my objections to and sanctions of narcotics.   The difference between escaping through activity and escaping through chemical alteration is the difference between exercise and steroid injections. It is the difference between increasing your height through a proper diet while still in your development stages and breaking your legs and resetting them repeatedly.   Not only is the activity unnecessary, a cop-out, and usually not even a remedy for a real malady, but it is an extreme approach and ultimately detrimental to the person's body, mind, and their professional life.   What I am saying is that in the case of drugs people are willfully giving up their freedoms; I would like to have it given back. Besides, if they are already giving up their freedom and humanity for a little pleasure, why on earth should they have the rights in the first place? Would you give a teenager a car if they decided to wreck it, on purpose, every time just to experience the thrill?   People shouldn't be allowed to choose to be slaves just as much as people aren't allowed to be slave-owners. I find it frightening that people seem to actively look to be controlled, by addiction or dictators, and I don't want such behavior to go unchecked.   Video games are an absence of the use of freedom, chemical alterations remove them or block them. Chemicals destroy personality and individuality, pass-times merely divert them and slow their growth or actualization.   Again, Marijuana isn't a big deal in this respect; but legalizing it certainly doesn't help. It does dull the senses, it does have long-term psychological and intellectual effects, and it is possibly as if not more carcinogenic than Tobacco and just as addictive (not yet completely substantiated so I could be wrong).  Some basic facts on it can be found here; a rather well-rounded survey of Marijuana and its effects:   http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/ marijuana.html    From the site:  ""Long-term marijuana abuse can lead to addiction; that is, compulsive drug seeking and abuse despite its known harmful effects upon social functioning in the context of family, school, work, and recreational activities. Long-term marijuana abusers trying to quit report irritability, sleeplessness, decreased appetite, anxiety, and drug craving, all of which make it difficult to quit.""  ""A number of studies have shown an association between chronic marijuana use and increased rates of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and schizophrenia.""  Now, that, again, is not known to be 100% true. Marijuana research is still in its developing stages (probably due to its illegality) and so not enough is known to say anything with certainty.   I'd like to see more studies to make sure that it is as benign as many people like to think it is. If it turns out to be then I have even less of a problem with it. The hard drugs, however, should always be illegal in my eyes.

In the quest to investigate the link between cancer and marijuana, research can be roughly divided into two categories: lab research and investigation of long term users outside of the lab. Yes, as an unfortunate amount of lab animal deaths can attest, cannabis does contain carcinogenic molecules. However, research involving actual users paints a rather different picture.    http://scienceblog.com/10660/ study-finds-no-link-between-marijuana- use-and-lung-cancer/     http://yourlife.usatoday.com/health/ story/2012-01-10/ Marijuana-doesnt-harm-lung-function- study-says/52483604/1    There is some controversy regarding the efficacy of these findings. Because marijuana is illegal, it is difficult to find users to participate in these studies, particularly finding heavy long-term users. It has been argued that if it were legalized, it would be much easier to find participants from a wider range of the population, and the information gathered could prove to be more accurate. Still, working with what we've got, it appears that marijuana use not only does not have anywhere near the effect that cigarette smoking does in terms of carcinogenic properties, it even seems to lower rates of certain types of cancer.    Marijuana is also highly addictive.   Not  highly . It is significantly less addicting than tobacco or alcohol, about on the same level as caffeine, but usually with less severe withdrawal symptoms. Pretty much anything that stimulates the reward centers of the brain will have some addictive qualities among a large enough sampling of users. But marijuana is very low on the totem pole compared to many legal and even non-regulated substances.    http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ the-teenage-mind/201012/ is-marijuana-addictive     http://health.ezinemark.com/ the-addictiveness-of-marijuana-or- cannabis-31e84cc7129.html     Studies have also shown that uses of marijuana usually lead to more dangerous drugs such as meth and cocaine.    Studies have also shown that most marijuana users drank alcohol before smoking pot. But alcohol is not considered a gateway drug. Why? Lower incidence of illegal drug use. But lets think about this for a second. As long as marijuana is illegal the people who use it can be classified as ""people who are willing to break at least one law."" Among adults, alcohol drinkers aren't classified that way. Some might be willing to, and those who are may end up using illegal drugs. Others will be totally law abiding, and since that is the majority of them, alcohol does not get considered a gateway drug. The only way to fairly compare the two would be to put them on the same legal standing and do studies at that point. Further, people who buy marijuana illegally have a greater exposure to other illegal drugs than those who don't since many dealers deal in multiple drugs. I suspect that the legal status of marijuana plays more of a role in its status as a gateway drug than any actual medical reason.    If you believe that marijuana does not kill people, try telling that to the relatives of the 30,000 people in Mexico that died due to drug violence.    The War On Drugs is at least partially to blame here. First, the strategy behind the WOD is to increase the cost. But since most drugs, marijuana included, are highly elastic commodities, this doesn't much reduce the demand. Instead it makes for wealthier drug lords, and competition between them leads to violence. The harder we crack down, the worse the situation gets. Also, we would make it less profitable for the drug lords by opening a legal channel of distribution and cultivation. Having marijuana as a legitimate source of retail would seriously reduce the number of people obtaining it illegally. It could also be regulated for quality and purity this way, which is currently not possible.

The team-building activities don't really work out till the they realize some wacko soviet soldiers are waiting in the woods to kill them one by one, only then they manage to form some sort of a group working together, helping each other, the survival of each is dependent on the survival of the team.  I figured that it might be a bit loose, but there is something about getting into drugs that brings back something that was lost during the arms race in the name of nape security. To illustrate - A few years ago I wrote a story about an alien civilization acting as if they were about to exterminate all humans, the aliens announced it on the news so a global panic was achieved, and nothing really happened, only that a feeling of survivalism boiled up everywhere, there was a greater power threatening from above, one intention over everyone, seeing all human kind as unified, ignoring our differences and difficulties with each other.

Although it is true that being high is kind of similar to being drunk there are some significant differences; marijuana makes things feel, for lack of a better term, sillier. Alcohol on the other hand, when used in excess can lead to blacking out, vomiting and not remembering what happened. In this way alcohol is significantly more dangerous. Whereas you can die from alcohol intoxication, too much marijuana really can't hurt you. Also, most of the negative feelings associated with alcohol, such as guilt and regret, are typically not experienced when using marijuana. We have also seen what happens when you make alcohol illegal: organized crime grew significantly in major cities because they were able to make an absurd amount of money selling bootleg liquor. Comparing alcohol to marijuana in this context would be accurate. The selling of marijuana by gangs is very profitable. You say that we should go down to Mexico to smoke but I live in Delaware and if I want to smoke with my friends going to Mexico for a weekend isn't a viable option. Instead I would have to find a drug dealer. This puts money in the hands of bad people. Legalization would put a stop to this.   Finally, for someone who claims to love the USA so much you seem to be okay with suppressing freedoms. The reason Mexico is different from the US is because they are relatively poor, their government is corrupt, and crime is rampant. Keeping marijuana illegal only helps criminals, so if you want the US to not be like Mexico then you should encourage the legalization of marijuana.

Now, if you're realistically thinking about this issue, and not in Imagination Land, you would respect my point of view as a faction of the democratic comity. I am a citizen of these United States of America, and I know what that means.   I personally have no concern about the drug itself and I am fully aware that cigarettes and alcohol are more dangerous, but legal.   When I say that I am opposed to the legalization of marijuana, what I mean is for recreational use. Medicinal use is fine for the few drugs on the market that marijuana could (realistically) replace. Also, I actually advocate the use of hemp and wish America would get with the program, I know the benefits of hemp cloths and hemp oils.   What I don't like about weed, is what it does to people, and I am sure this is the reason it has been made illegal and mainly, why it has stayed illegal. I have seen the original arguments against it's recreational use, and I think that is absurd, it doesn't make you crazy, it doesn't make you blood thirsty, etc.    If you look at society as a whole, we already have a few cancers at work. Alcohol use, which with it brings tons of social deviance because it's a mind altering drug. Cigarettes, for the economy are bad, because those who smoke are hopelessly addicted and will spend money on cigarettes before spending it on things that they should buy, like food or clothes. Do we really, at this point need another? For people who don't drink, and for people who don't smoke cigarettes?   Like I said, think about it realistically. What is government for? Why is a government needed at all, I mean, what is the main single duty of a government???  It is to secure domestic peace , before anything else, that is what a government does. The people within the government agree to be controlled for peace. If someone steps out of line, because they have agreed to live under this government, are held to the same rules as the next. No one steps out of line, and we have a perfectly paired society to it's government. Unfortunately we, as humans, cannot have this.    So if the government only really exists to secure domestic peace, yet we already have a number of drugs out there, why should we have another to complicate things with.    Also, you have to imagine that weed is legal. No more will people feel the need to be home when stoned. They might as well get stoned in public. Like drinking, especially if it were made illegal, people would take their beer home with them, and drink there, most people  do , stay home and drink. If it were illegal, you wouldn't see drunk people as much now would you? I highly doubt you would.    Marijuana, I logically think, would be more addicting than tobacco and alcohol combined if it were made legal and then integrated into popular culture, as tobacco is. You get more for less, with less consequences... what a dream, right? I mean, if I am opposed to the legalization, yet I would still do it if it were, doesn't that mean something???   It's something that I don't want to deal with, and I think a lot of people would agree with me on this. If it were legalized, it would only get worse.    That's really all I can say for now, and sorry if it wasn't enough to satisfy your lack of understanding.    I would like to advise you that ad hominen arguments are not welcome here.      You are on a website that allows you to share ideas and opinions.

You also seem to think it will magically develop addictive properties once its legal.  You fail to show why the law should be invasive enough to regulate what you put in your own body, or why the law should be used to legislate away things you don't like. Governments allow industry to put all kinds of toxins and waste into our food, air, and water, and the government gets paid to allow it, and all the citizens are forced to ingest it. No reason we shouldn't all have the right to knowingly poison ourselves.  Also, your argument seems to assume that many people would suddenly begin using marijuana who are not already, and there's no data to prove this. People are already spending their pot budgets, nothing would change there (except maybe they could grow it and save).  Your entire view of government is rather disturbing. ""The people within the government agree to be controlled for peace."" Citizen-control is  not  a constitutional principle, in fact our rights insulate us from overt control by the government.

The ultimate weakness and surest sign of gluttony, bitching about your unnecessary substances.   ""I know many, many, many other people that fit this criteria as well.""   So what? Many, many, many other people strive to define humanity as something other than a waste of billions of years of evolution and suffering for burnt plant fumes that create a careless and happy go lucky floaty feeling.   I'm one of those people that know the meaning and worth of discipline. There's something sacred about reality and the way that the earth is when it's ""dull"" and quiet that no one seems to get... everything needs to be brilliantly colorful, exciting, relaxing, whatever, some form of artificial stimulation needs to be administered to get any good experience out of anything. It can't just be left alone and truly appreciated the way it is.   I don't have a problem with the drug, I have a problem with people. I don't have a problem with people, but that they still act like animals. I feel like I'm the only real human left, like the only person I'm fighting for is myself, to show myself that I'm not a monster like the rest of you. That I'm actually worth the effort put forth by my bloodline a million fold because I am different. I won't lay down because it feels good, I won't lay down because ""I need a break"" in my finite life of only 23 years, I won't lay down because I deserve it!   Laying down is for the weak. That's what you fools are doing. You just want you weed because the alcohol, cigarettes, caffein, television, shopping malls aren't good enough. You just want your plant.   Now, I bit good riddance to you and your damned marijuana, I have work to do.

In the bill it stated that the industry created from this would bring in more that a billion dollars in tax revenue. That's just the tax revenue it would generate and just in California.  As to your point about private growers:  Do you grow your own food?.... I rest my case. It's a matter of convenience. Some will do it ,yes, but most won't.  And people can and do grow their own tobacco. I have a few friends who carry around a bag of tobacco and rolling papers for cigarettes precisely for the reason you stated. Personally, I find cigarettes to be even worse that alcohol. The only positive your system ever feels from a cigarette is the quench of a physical addiction due to the nature of the substance.

247	marijuana	K	19	-1	1	null	ledhead818	null	"I will argue first from a practical position, then philosophical, then historical.  Marijuana is not dangerous. There has been a death recorded due to marijuana. The LD50 or amount that it would take to kill half the population is incredibly high. Far higher. You can reasonably say it is so high, it is impossible to die from overdosing on marijuana. Also marijuana does not make you stupid. The reason people think this, is that there was a study done on monkey where they let them breathe only marijuana smoke and they died from hypoxia or lack of oxygen. When you die from a lack of oxygen, your brain cells die. The severe errors in the study, however, were released much later than the results so there is now a stigma that marijuana use makes you stupid. They have found that smoking marijuana does not cause cancer like cigarette smoke. A UCLA study found no link. The gateway drug theory is actually perpetuated by the prohibition of marijuana. Because marijuana users must get pot from drug dealers, they are exposed to harder, dangerous drugs. If marijuana was able to be sold in stores, this would not happen. Legalizing marijuana would not lead to an increase in use by children. According to many studies, it is vastly easier for teenagers to get marijuana than it is for them them to get alcohol. This is because alcohol must be purchased through legal channels where vendors check for IDs. However, because of the black market for marijuana drug dealers do not care how old someone is when they sell them pot. The legalization of marijuana will be very good for the economy. We spend billions of dollars each year to keep people in prison because they like to get high and relax. Additionally marijuana is a huge cash crop the government could make a lot of money off from taxation. It is the number one cash crop in California for example. ~60% of the money of Mexican drug cartels is earned by selling marijuana in the US. Severely compromising their funding would reduce crime in the United States as well as Mexico, which would help improve Mexico's living conditions and curb illegal immigration into the United States.  The government should not have a right to prohibit you from doing something to yourself that does not harm anyone else. It is not illegal to go home and drink a gallon of paint thinner, but I guarantee that it's much better for both you and society that you smoke marijuana instead of drinking paint thinner. Here's a more reasonable example: Should the government make it illegal to consume significantly more calories than you expend? This is much more harmful than marijuana, and obesity related illnesses are one of the leading causes of death. The bottom line is that this type of reasoning that the government needs to be able to protect you from yourself is dangerously close to fascism. Where do you draw the line? Do we monitor people's jobs and make it illegal to not work hard to make sure people are productive and that they get promoted? Do we make it illegal to be late for job interviews because that is bad for you? Do we make it illegal to sleep in beds instead of on the floor because people have died this way and no one has ever died from marijuana? The answer is no. Adults are free to make their own decisions that only affect themselves. We do not live in a ""nanny-state"" as Ron Paul puts it.  Many people assume that because marijuana is illegal serious research and thinking went into the decision to ban it. This simply isn't true. The first marijuana laws in the United States forced people to grow marijuana during colonial times. Marijuana became illegal for a few reasons. One was due to extreme anti-Latino and anti-black sentiment. People were fear mongered into believing that minorities were a danger to white society especially due to marijuana. The ""reefer madness"" campaign created undue hysteria. Yellow journalism and personal career advancement also played a role. In fact President Nixon commissioned a report on marijuana which concluded that marijuana should not be illegal.  http://www.druglibrary.org/Schaffer/ Library/studies/nc/ncmenu.htm    The next logical question is why is marijuana still illegal. Again there are a few reasons. What kept it illegal during the middle and late 1900s was again a fear mongering campaign linking marijuana use and communism. By this point in history there is so much social stigma against marijuana, that if you ask someone against legalization why it should be illegal, they will most likely cite things that simply aren't true. Additionally the alcohol and tobacco industries are absolutely huge. Companies in those industries make a so much money that they can spend vast amounts lobbying congress to keep marijuana illegal. They don't want competition. Why would you drink or smoke tobacco when they are incredibly dangerous and addictive when you can smoke marijuana which is harmless and not addictive? Many people underestimate the effect that a large lobby can have on national and state policy. The alcohol and tobacco companies also perpetuate the social stigma against marijuana by funding anti-drug and anti-marijuana advertisements and programs. The goal of these programs is not to make you not do drugs, its to stop you from doing drugs that they don't sell you. Also marijuana for medicinal purposes is a huge threat to the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry is the biggest industry in the United States. Just like the tobacco and alcohol companies, pharmaceutical companies spend millions of dollars lobbying congress. Marijuana has been some doctors as the single best drug for maintaining health. It combats an astonishing number of diseases and conditions, and has no side effects. Compare that to the multitude of side effects from prescription drugs. It has become a cliche how at the end of television commercials for prescription drugs they rattle off a long list of some pretty serious side effects. Thousands of people die from adverse reactions to prescription drugs.  As I hope you can see, the prohibition of marijuana is completely wrong on many levels. Making marijuana legal will keep it away from kids, keep people away from dangerous hard drugs, and allow adults to make their own choices when it comes to their own lives.

I don't see how you can support prohibition of marijuana, but not alcohol and tobacco without realizing what a hypocrite you are. Alcohol and tobacco are far worse no matter what metric you use.   ""Just because pot may not be physically addicting, does not mean it is not mentally addicting, which is just as bad. It means your brain is hooked and can't function without it. ""   No you can still function without it, you are thinking about the addiction that comes from cigarettes which you support. Marijuana can be psychologically addictive. All that means is that if you really like the feeling of being high, you will want to do it again. This does not mean you are not able to not do it. Anything that you enjoy can be psychologically addictive (Sex, gambling, createdebate.com). Even if marijuana were addictive like cigarettes and alcohol, you cannot use this point to argue against legalization unless you support prohibition of alcohol and tobacco. As I said name something bad that it doesn't have in common with those two drugs.   ""They tend to forget that marijuana smoke is 6 times worse than cigarette smoke, when it comes to carbon monoxide and the toxicity of the smoke itself.""   You have one misleading and one incorrect fact there. Marijuana smoke has been shown to not cause cancer. Scientists hypothesized that it would cause cancer because it contains more harmful chemicals, but when they did actual studies on live animals, they found absolutely no link between marijuana and any form of cancer. This is just one study by UCLA I can get more if you desire them.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/25/AR2006052501729.html   So while it may be true that it contains more harmful chemicals, for whatever reason it still doesn't cause cancer.   In reference to the toxicity of the smoke, you couldn't be more wrong. Scientists have not been able to induce death in an animal due to marijuana. It's LD50, or quantity that would be lethal to half the population, is so high, that we cannot even find it. It is physically impossible to overdose on marijuana and consequently there has never been a recorded death due to it.   http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/mj_overdose.htm   I have absolutely no idea what you are talking about when you say smoke causes ""little nicks"" in arteries. Please cite an article or study because what you are saying makes no sense.  The study you cited by the British Lung Foundation doesn't appear to have been published in a peer reviewed medical journal like the studies that show marijuana is not harmful. Here is why the study is misleading.  They start out with a very bold statement  ""Smoking pure cannabis is more harmful to lungs than tobacco, a health charity is warning.""  So you continue on reading to see how exactly they proved that.  First ""evidence"":  ""A study by the British Lung Foundation found that just three cannabis joints a day cause the same damage as 20 cigarettes. ""  First of all it is very uncommon to smoke three joints a day. Secondly they were most likely comparing unfiltered joints and filtered joints which is really intellectually dishonest. They also don't talk about what type of damage they are referring to. Marijuana smoke does temporarily paralyze the cilia or small hairs in your air passageways which can temporarily increase the risk of colds and other upper respiratory tract infections(OH NO). The smoke does not cause permanent damage to the lungs. Furthermore there are other ways to ingest marijuana, including water filtering which removes a significant amount of tar and dangerous chemicals, vaporizing which releases only the THC and no harmful chemicals, and eating which also releases no tar or dangerous chemicals.  Second ""evidence"":  ""Evidence shows that tar from cannabis cigarettes contains 50% more cancer causing carcinogens than tobacco. ""  As I said earlier this is a really dishonest thing to say. While it may contain more carcinogens, it doesn't cause cancer. Numerous studies have failed to find any link. Yet there are an immeasurable number of studies that show the direct link between tobacco smoke and cancer. Think about it, if marijuana smoke was so much worse than tobacco smoke, or even bad all, why are there no studies showing it actually causes cancer, but so many showing tobacco causes cancer. There is even research marijuana may kill cancerous cells and leave healthy cells alone.   http://www.salem-news.com/articles/ january112008/cancer_treatment_11008.php                                           As I said, they don't have any concrete evidence that it causes health problems. It is not enough to say it contains dangerous chemicals. Especially when numerous studies show the chemicals don't cause damage.  You still somehow manage to fail to name one negative result of legalizing marijuana that does not apply to alcohol or cigarettes with evidence. Every thing you named once again is present in alcohol or tobacco and most of them weren't true.  So once again I ask you to name a negative result of marijuana that isn't present in tobacco or alcohol. And don't give me, 'it's too late to make alcohol and tobacco illegal.' First of all it is never too late, that is a cop out. But regardless of the pragmatism of making them illegal, I'll bet you still don't think we should.

""  Yes, alcohol does cause brain damage- in minors. As we mature, our neurons deposit a compound called myelin around the axon of a dendrite. These myelin deposits are known as Schwann cells and their purpose is to make transmitting information quicker. Electrical impulses simply skip over these sections and go from node to node much quicker than if they weren't there. That's why it is illegal up until 21, when this stage of development has stopped and cannot be harmed any longer.  Truth is, smoking  anything  is bad for you. The only difference is that marijuana smoke has way more carbon monoxide. Inhaling this will limit the amount of oxygen that can go to your brain and can kill brain cells if they do not get enough oxygen. It could also cause other parts of the body to not get enough oxygen, like the muscles and the heart. This is why when people are high, they slow down.  And no, cigarette smoking has not been scientifically proven. The only way to prove this would be to formulate an experiment where you assign X amount of people to smoke 10 packs a day or whatever and X amount of people to smoke nothing for 20 years and get back to them to compare results. This is an unethical experiment and cannot be done since one part of the study could lead to death. (I took a stats course and we discussed this in depth for a day.)  And the website was about tobacco smoke. I knew that. But I deliberately pointed out that it mentioned how carbon monoxide can harm the blood vessels, which is present in marijuana smoke as well.

Of those charged with cannabis violations, approximately 89 percent, 775,137 Americans were charged with possession only. An American is now arrested for violating cannabis laws every 38 seconds.

Cost:  ""Since December 31, 1995, the U.S. prison population has grown an average of 43,266 inmates per year. About 25 per cent are sentenced for drug law violations. "" -Many of these people's lives were completely ruined by incarceration.  ""The U.S. federal government spent over $19 billion dollars in 2003 on the War on Drugs, at a rate of about $600 per second. The budget has since been increased by over a billion dollars. "" - All these tax dollars spent in attempt to prevent something that's never going away and millions of hard working American citizens enjoy.  So the war on drugs is completely un-effective and also extremely costly in terms of human life, happiness, and finances. All quotes taken from  http://www.drugsense.org/wodclock.htm  which has further references.  Also, read the government's findings on marijuana here:  http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/ marijuana.html    Keep in mind most of everything that is said in this report uses words such as ""may"" and ""could"" because nothing, as of now, is conclusive. This is in spite of the fact that we as humans have been using it for thousands of years. My feeling on this is that if marijuana actually is dangerous....then not only would we know it from hearing about it, but these studies would have conclusive, definitive results. Not wishy-washy, half-assed results. Also: you won't find anything in that report that is worse than existing legal substances and pharmacueticals (think vicoden, lithium, valuum, morphein, wel butron, etc.).  So...what the hell? Why are we having a war on pot?   Results of ending the war on drugs: no more tax money being spent, millions of Americans' lives will be instantly better as they will not be incarcerated, etc. A new industry will be created that will provide tax revenue, jobs, etc. A small number (comparatively) of government workers would lose their jobs.  Results of not ending the war on drugs: DEA agents, etc. and others will not lose their jobs. Politicians will continue to have something to be proud of and market themselves with. People will continue to use drugs anyway, as history has shown and nothing will change as it is now and has been since it was made illegal.  An alternative to the war on drugs? We need to shift our thinking from drug addict, CRIMINALS to drug addict, PATIENTS. Meaning these people need help, not jail. There's a reason they are taking the drug - lets solve the problem with using therapy, clinics, raising awareness, and educating people so that they can make their own healthy decisions.

And as someone who has been around both and tried both and tried both in excess, it's my opinion that alcohol is a far more dangerous drug than marijuana.   Marijuana does inflict harm to the self, but that's where it ends. People don't get high and then get belligerent, angry, and violent. They don't get high and drive overconfidently at 90 mph. I'm not saying driving under the influence of marijuana is by any means safe, but in comparison to alcohol, it is a lot safer. When you're under the influence of alcohol, you become overconfident in your abilities and drive without the normal care and caution you would have. Your vision is also blurred and reaction times slowed. Under marijuana, again your reaction times are slowed, but unlike using alcohol, when you drive under the influence of marijuana you drive with more care and caution than normal. It's the positive effect of paranoia. Furthermore, you can overdose on alcohol and die from it, which is an impossibility with marijuana.   It's interesting that you bring up prohibition and then state that you're afraid it will cause problems because people will become ""addicted"" to it. Prohibition is an excellent example to bring up. What did history teach us about prohibition? That it doesn't work. People will always self medicate, and so long as the substances they are using are absent of any serious effects, they will continue using those substances.   In fact, legalization of marijuana may cut down on the ""gateway"" effect of the drug (though I don't buy the gateway argument in and of itself, but more on that later). Many people try marijuana after being taught by the government's propaganda what a terrible awful drug it is. Once they try it and learn the truth, that it's very similar to alcohol, with a few key differences, they begin to question the government's authority on other drugs as well. ""If they lied to me about marijuana, maybe cocaine's not all that bad either.""   On the other hand, let me say this to the gateway argument. Tobacco and alcohol are the number one and number two gateway drugs. So if we call marijuana a gateway, let us only do so after calling out the top two.   As far as medicinal marijuana goes, you've obviously either done little to no research on the topic or you lack compassion. You state that cancer patients use it to numb the pain of treatment and to make them hungry in order to counteract the effects of nausea from treatment. I ask, what is wrong with that? It seems that if people are going through a very painful and difficult treatment (that may not even succeed) they might be entitled to pain relief and some semblance of a normal life (i.e. being able to eat normally). Nobody claims that marijuana ""cures"" anything, it's pain medication, much like morphine, demerol, vicodin, etc. AND it's natural. No pharmaceutical company has mixed in chemical compounds to create it. I get terrible menstrual cycles, they've always been awful and have gotten worse as I've gotten a bit older. The only thing that successfully treats the pain and discomfort I feel during those first two days is, you guessed it, marijuana.   Prohibition has been tried...for seventy years. And rather than reduce marijuana use, now nearly half of the country admits to having tried the substance. We waste money on criminalization of marijuana and we create crime. If marijuana were available legally, drug dealers would be out of business, and users would no longer have to be jailed at your expense. The government would be able to tax the substance and make a pretty penny off of people's use of it as well.   There's no proof that use of marijuana would increase if prohibition ended. It would make us all safer and save us a ton of money. I'm sick of the hypocrisy of alcohol-users in regards to marijuana. If you want to oppose it, fine, but you sure as hell better oppose it's uglier, scarier brother, Alcohol, first.

When someone engages in the use of drugs, it is the decision of that person and they are only hurting themselves nor the government.  Second, economically, instead of enforcing drug prohibition with $10 billion of spending, the government could control the supply of drugs by legally selling the product and taxing where estimates range in $10 billion dollars as well. The government would have 10 billion dollars to spend elsewhere. It would eliminate drug cartels.

It is far less potentially addictive than the other two, does not appear to have nearly as many physical ailments associated with it as tobacco or heavy alcohol use, and is much less likely to incite violence than alcohol. Some argue that this marijuana is a gateway drug. They forget that many people who use other drugs also began drinking first. The reason further drug experimentation is more likely to occur with pot use than with alcohol is not because pot ""leads one to search for a better high"" (otherwise we should expect similar results with alcohol, as it is more ""mellow"" than harder drugs) but is almost certainly because one is legal and the other is not. Legalization also increases the amount of information health agencies can get about its use and make it more likely for heavy users to get treatment. And it is simply ludicrous for our already strained prison and court systems to have to process people for possession and distribution of a substance that is roughly equivalent to substances we accept. And arguably the best point: we could stop using taxpayer money to crack down on dealers and instead tax pot sales via liscenced distributors. This is a particularly timely point given our government's deficit.

In a recent study for the Fraser Institute, Economist Stephen T. Easton, it was calculated how much tax revenue the Canadian government could gain by legalizing marijuana. So, the study estimates that the average price of 0.5 grams (a unit) of marijuana sold for $8.60 on the street, while its cost of production was only $1.70. If government legalize marijuana the price for it will fall because it will have become readily available + the government will get taxes.

It can ease the nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and, at the same time, give you a wonderful high.  Despite the positives, I am not convinced. There are so many other factors that need to be considered. Marijuana causes some parts of the brain - such as those governing the emotions, memory and judgment - to spin out of control.If you choose to ignore the attacks and memory loss, consider what marijuana can do to your lungs. Its smoke carries more tar and other particles than tobacco. You can relieve your migraine, but you also have a higher chance of developing lung cancer.To drug policy reformers, prohibition of marijuana is not just a cause to be supported, but a mandatory way of life, necessary to uphold society’s moral fiber.
