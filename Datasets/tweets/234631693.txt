Dr. Caffrey said "no." #nannytrial
In cross-examination, defense attorney asks Dr. Caffrey if he asked #YoselynOrtega if she heard voices, about her medical history, whether she suffered from sadness and other issues. #nannytrial
#YoselynOrtega shakes head and says, "wow" as Dr. Caffrey testifies. He said he diagnosed her as having generalized anxiety disorder, and was in a chronic depressive state #Nannytrial
Dr. Caffrey said he expected #YoselynOrtega to return for further treatment. Three days after she saw him she slaughtered two young children in her care. #Nannytrial
#YoselynOrtega shows the most reaction during Dr. Caffrey's testimony. She smirked and shook her head as he spoke and explained his analysis of her #nannytrial
Dr. Caffrey wrote in his notes that #yoselynortega was anxious, worried, had phobia, depression, restless, and more. #nannytrial
#YoselynOrtega begged Dr. Caffrey to see her that day and showed up to her appointment early. She talked about financial stressors, her son who she had left in DR when he was 4, her sister, etc. #nannytrial
@jamesmckinleyjr reported last month: "It remains unclear if she received a diagnosis. A search of her apartment turned up only a bevy of creams and medications for skin problems, but nothing to treat a mental illness, court papers show." 	#nannytrial
3 days before the killings, Ms. Ortega went berserk in the kitchen of the apartment she shared with her sister, throwing pots &amp; pans around, then claimed later she could not remember what happened.That same day, Ms. Ortega saw a Manhattan psychologist, Thomas Caffrey #nannytrial

In #NannyTrial, Jurors See Photos of ‚Äòthe Most Horrendous Scene‚Äô 		My latest: https://t.co/fHJIVIiDTp
Detective said he finished processing the crime scene and left the home at 6:30 am the next day, but then went to a precinct to take photographs of the evidence there. He was done at 4 pm that day. Almost 24hrs after the murders #nannytrial
He said he photographed a butcher block, blood stains in all three bedrooms, on the wall and in the rear bathroom. #nannytrial
He returned to the hospital a second time that night after #YoselynOrtega was out of surgery and took additional photos of her injuries which included injuries to wrists and abrasions on hands #nannytrial
Then he proceeded to Weill Cornell Hosp. to photograph #YoselynOrtega who was stabilized in the emergency room. #nannytrial
So, he went to St. Lukes Hospital where the Krim children were to photograph and document the children's injuries. He also collected their clothing: a cut up shirt, jeans, boots, underwear + blankets #nannytrial
Pantoja said he didn't immediately process the crime scene because law enforcement needed to verify whether a search warrant was needed to search the residence #nannytrial
Pantoja said he got a call at around 6 pm about the murders. Arrived at 6:53 pm for a double homicide. #nannytrial
Now up: Det. Carlos Pantoja, w/ the Crime Scene Unit also responded to the call re the murdered Krim children. He has responded to several thousand crime scenes and processed a thousand crime scenes himself. #nannytrial
ESU officer answers questions from defense attorney Valerie Van Leer-Greenberg about the treatment provided to #YoselynOrtega. #nannytrial

Nicolas said once he and his partner got the children into the ambulance, an officer who rode with them began praying. "He was praying, asking God to save the children and have mercy." #nannytrial
"When the police get upset its a pretty good indicator that something awful is going on," said Eugene Darden Nicolas, another paramedic now on the witness stand who said an officer knocked on the window of theor ambulance after the bodies were discovered #nannytrial
Orr said the crime scene inside of the Krim household "was probably the most horrendous scene in my 27 years. The tub is practically filled with blood. They needed a surgeon, not me." #nannytrial

"Should I grab this person? Is this a crime scene?" Super said he asked himself. "I'm just a super. I'm going to hold this door shut. No one is getting out." #nannytrial
Super: "I open the door and see someone staring w/ the eyes of the devil... all full of blood on her chest... all of this was red," he says of #yoselynOrtega #nannytrial
#YoselynOrtega's attorney Valerie Van Leer-Greenberg begins to cross-examine the super. #nannytrial
#YoselynOrtega watches super as he testifies, but stared straight-ahead during Marina Krim's testimony on Thursday #nannytrial
Super pauses as he describes the horrific scene in the bathroom. "I just saw red," he said referring to the tub where the Krim children were. #nannytrial
Super said he and his wife tried to comfort Ms. Krim who was incoherent at the time and muttered "they're dead." He went to her apt &amp; found #YoselynOrtega in apt with bloody towel to her neck, choking on blood #nannytrial
Super points to a layout of the Krim apartment which shows bathroom at back of apt. He says he was exercising in his living room when he heard Marina Krim scream #nannytrial
Super said he didn't interact much w/ #YoselynOrtega. They never spoke. He did not notice anything unusual about her. #nannytrial
Super discusses his responsibilities. He lived below the Krim family. Said, "I just knew there was a nanny there." #nannytrial

Suicide note Conrad Roy left #MichelleCarter via @BostonGlobe https://t.co/uHEVASgxv9
Court session is over. Judge Lawrence Moniz said he will render verdict and notify public #MichelleCarter
Prosecutor: "#MichelleCarter absolutely knew what she was doing &amp; absolutely cause the death of this 18 yr old boy."
Prosecutor: "...And you can commit a crime via text." #MichelleCarter
"Ppl fall in love over the internet, texts, bully over the internet, you can encourage someone to die via text," ADA said #michellecarter
Prosecutor: "The risk #Michellecarter created was reckless &amp; amounts to involuntary manslaughter." She didn't have to be present, she said.
Prosecutor: "MichelleCarter's friends are asking questions. Time is running out. Noe he's got to kill himself. She can't be a liar."
Prosecutor said that after #MichelleCarter lied to friends about Roy missing or being dead 2days before his death that it had to then happen
Prosecutor said #MichelleCarter text another boy &amp; referred to Roy as a friend who was missing, but to friends called him love of her life
Prosecutor: #MichelleCarter desperately wanted attention. She was texting girls who didn't want anything to do with her.
Prosecutor says the last words Roy heard was from #MichelleCarter encouraging him to kill himself.
Prosecutor said yes Roy researched suicide methods, but was working through things. Every1 has bad days &amp; if lucky opportunity to try again
Prosecutor: "I would suggest Conrad Roy was a very self aware young man. 1 reason he wanted to live was his family." #Michellecarter trial
Prosecutor: #MichelleCarter was manipulating Roy &amp; other ppl as well."
Prosecutor: "#michellecarter's words of encouragement were throughout, but they were especially prevalent when he has doubts."
Prosecutor: "It got to the pt where Roy was apologizing to #michellecarter for letting him down for not being dead yet."
Prosecutor: "#MichelleCarter she kicked his feet from under him."
Prosecutor: "In the days Roy didn't want to do it #MichelleCarter berated him &amp;asked why... &amp; he had the audacity to be alive the next day."
Prosecutor: "#MichelleCarter created the harm. She knew what would happen when he got back into that truck. She knew he would die."
Defense: "It's sad, its tragic but its just not a homicide." #MichelleCarter trial
Defense: #MichelleCarter was confused. She thought she was doing the right thing"
But defense says prosecutors did the same thing in trying to determine #MichelleCarter's guilt
Defense says prosecutors tried to tell expert earlier that he could not rely on #MichelleCarter texts to determine her mental state
Defense: "Conrad Roy drove to Kmart. He calls #MichelleCarter because he knows she's encouraging &amp; supporting his plan."
Defense: Roy planned this. Het gets a water pump. he has to put it in his truck &amp; drive it somewhere. #MichelleCarter trial
Roy researched how to make suicide look like accident, "He's not trying to make it seem like he's a victim of a homicide." #michellecarter
Defense: Roy is looking up ways to kill himself, and looking up suicide by cop. #MichelleCarter
Defense: "To turn around &amp; say she's bullying him, coercing him, he said, 'You wanna help?'" #michellecarter
Defense: "Roy said to #MichelleCarter, 'Only way I would hate you is if you told someone,' and We know she didn't tell anyone your honor."
Defense: "Roy said to #michellecarter, 'There is nothing anyone can do to make me want to live.'"
Defense: Roy tells #MichelleCarter about killing himself via water intoxication.
Defense: #MichelleCarter was on medication for her own issues and was trying to help him w/ his.
Defense: "The records clearly demonstrate the state of Conrad Roy's thought process, long history of suicides..." #MichelleCarter
Defense: prosecutors tried to say that "somehow #MichelleCarter had control over him &amp; he couldn't think for himself. Thats not the case."
Defense: "He brings her along on this sad journey." #MichelleCarter
Defense: "He doesn't tell her to stop, or lose my #, or block the call, nothing. He continues to use #MichelleCarter to carry out his plan."
Defense: "He chose to get in that car. He chose to continuously talk to #MichelleCarter."
Conrad Roy's mom stepped out as defense says "This was a suicide, not a homicide. This is somebody who eventually wanted to take his life."
Defense giving closing statements now. #MichelleCarter

Breggin is stepping down. #MichelleCarter trial
Breggin cont'd: "I think she's going thru some very weird, disturbing things in her head." #MichelleCarter trial
Breggin says tho: "To say that this is going to be some sort of dry run makes no sense to me, clinically." #MichelleCarter trial
Prosecutors suggested #MichelleCarter wanted to see how friends would react to Roy's death, that's why she lied to them re his whereabouts
Defense shows texts messages where friends acknowledge seeing scars on #michellecarter fro cutting.
In one text msg #MichelleCarter says "What's the 1 thing worth living for?"	Roy: "My family."
Breggin said he doesn't think children should be medicated for their behaviors. #MichelleCarter trial
And that #MichelleCarter had badly wanted to impress that friend, &amp; therefore didn't want to lie to her. Roy killed himself two days later
Prosecutor notes that #MichelleCarter had lied to that friend when she said Roy was missing two days before he actually killed himself.
In that text #MichelleCarter was telling the friend that she was dealing w/ her eating disorder, the friend didn't believe her
Prosecutor shows another text where #MichelleCarter's friend tells her she doesn't like when ppl lie to her.
But prosecutor says: "How about #MichelleCarter wanted to know how her friends would react if he actually killed himself."
Breggin said it is part of #MichelleCarter's very confused, delusional state
Prosecutor showing text messages where #MichelleCarter tells a friend Roy is missing, while simultaneously texting Roy about generator
Breggin said he relied on #MichelleCarter's messages for insight into her mental state, but prosecutor says her word is not reliable
Prosecutor: "So you have information on the circumference of #MichelleCarter head as a baby but you dn't have any of her therapists records?
Prosecutor asks Breggin if he has #MichelleCarter's primary care records, pediatric records?	Breggin: "Yes.."
Breggin said he no longer holds those views. He is more conservative now. #Michellecarter
Prosecutor reads more excerpts from Breggin's book, which he said he wrote 35 yrs ago. Prosecutor says he has a bias #MichelleCarter trial
Prosecutor found a book where Breggin wrote that most laws of the land are "coercive &amp; unjust." #MichelleCarter
Judge Lawrence Moniz fired back: "I will determine the criminal intent here. That answer is stricken." #MichelleCarter
Breggin: "She doesn't throw her phone away, there's no criminal intent here." #MichelleCarter trial
#MichelleCarter expressed fear to that friend about possible going to jail. But Breggin says it speaks to her "innocence."
Prosecutor also notes text #MichelleCarter sent to a friend re fear about police inquiring about Roy's suicide
Prosecutor continues to make pt that #MichelleCarter was seeking attn all along, &amp; that event for Conrad Roy was still about her
"There are many factors that would make that not an appropriate dose at all," Breggin said re amount of Celexa #MichelleCarter was taking
"She was anorexic, ill, now bulimic...had liver issues, #MichelleCarter was also a small person," Breggin said noting celexa was bad for her
Going back to the issue of Celexa, the antidepressant #MichelleCarter was on Breggin said it was not approved for children
Breggin said #MichelleCarter was disturbed.
Prosecutor: #michellecarter was "untruthful to her therapist. When it comes to telling adults whats going on she's inconsistent."
Breggin: People walk around w/ delusions all of the time and carry out their activities. #MichelleCarter
Prosecutor and Breggin engage in a bit of back and forth regarding the meaning of psychosis. #MichelleCarter trial
Prosecutor said that two families suffering from what has occurred &amp; releasing docs will expose both "for the world to see." #MichelleCarter
Court is in session. Prosecutor requesting that #michellecarter &amp; Conrad Roy's medical records be impounded.

Prosecutor said #MichelleCarter saw a therapist who said she had good eye contact, appropriate insight, good attitude, pleasant, logical
Breggin continues to defend his analysis of #MichelleCarter. says she had intense feelings, and at times became irritable, even w/ friends
Prosecutor: #MichelleCarter berated Roy when he didn't kill himself."	Breggin said she transformed on 6/29. Few days later she's aggressive
Breggin: Theres a 2 day pd where she is provoking him and trying to get him to say he is not going to kill himself. #MichelleCaarter
Prosecutor says to Breggin is it fair to say that your baseline was pretty off? #MichelleCarter
Prosecutor notes that Breggin previously said #MichelleCarter didn't suffer from anxiety or depression
Breggin" #MichelleCarter seemed reasonably happy. "I had no knowledge about this cold, dark texting."
Breggin said he didn't have all of the info or texts msgs. #MichelleCarter trial
Prosecutor says to Breggin that he initially found that #michelleCarter was not depressed &amp; no one called her anxious.
Prosecutor: A schoolmate reported that #michelleCarter was threatening to harm herself, but later said she didn't do anything
Prosecutor to Breggin: "You didn't even call her therapist or try to talk to them?" #MichelleCarter
Breggin said he did not talk to any of #MichelleCarter's doctors. Said he doesn't ask to talk to police detectives either
Breggin says that it is not unusual for young ppl to hide the fact that they're cutting. Prosecutor not buying it #MichelleCarter
Breggin: "You're making it sound manipulative."	Prosecutor: "Yes!"	#MichelleCarter trial
Prosecutor: "#MichelleCarter says things to ppl &amp; asks for help. She asks them to confide in her."

Breggin said #MichelleCarter becomes delusional because she thinks she can help Roy get to heaven, take care of his family after his death
Breggin says #MichelleCarter became involuntary intoxicated on July 2. Her messages of "get help" suddenly change

ICYMI My latest on the #MichelleCarter trial: https://t.co/wEmOChR1dr
RT @mlevenson: Rachelle Bond‚Äôs testimony might not be enough to convict, legal specialists say https://t.co/yJFtV2mrnr
The court is about 5 minutes into recess that ends at 11 am. Judge Moniz is reviewing further evidence &amp; may make a decision on motion 2day.
"This is not constitutionally protected speech," the prosecutor said. #MichelleCarter
But he didn't want to die, the prosecutor said. That's causation she said of #MichelleCarter
Prosecutor said for 12 days Conrad Roy spoke about being hesitant, &amp; on the day he died #MichelleCarter told him to get back in the car.
Prosecutor said to judge, "Don't look at it in a vacuum that she was just saying these words &amp; he could have ignored them." #MichelleCarter
Prosecutor said #MichelleCarter "knew he was relying on her and said, 'I love you, kill yourself.'"
"She knew he had social anxiety, was depressed&amp; she knew his frailties She also knew what it was like herself to be lonely." #MichelleCarter
"It may be odd, your honor for me to suggest that words of love could somehow be considered reckless," the prosecutor argued.#MichelleCarter
Prosecutor said #MichelleCarter "used words of 'kill yourself' w/ words of love. It's clear Conrad grew to depend on her &amp; rely on her."
Prosecutor said over the course of their texting relationship #michellecarter &amp; Conrad Roy formed a bond
"Because this was a mostly texting relationship shouldn't diminish her role in the eyes of the law," Prosecutor argues #MichelleCarter trial
Prosecutor argues that #MichelleCarter played on Conrad Roy's weaknesses
"It's insufficient to say that she caused him to die," said #MichelleCarter's attorney Joseph P. Cataldo
Defense said Conrad Roy had long been suicidal and had written suicide notes in 2012. #MichelleCarter trial
#MichelleCarter's attorney also said Massachusetts does not have a law that makes it a crime if someone urges another to end their life.
Defense in #MichelleCarter case is arguing now that prosecutors have not demonstrated causation, that she actually caused Conrad Roy's death
ICYMI --&gt; ‚ÄòWhen are you doing it?‚Äô Read the latest texts in the #MichelleCarter case: https://t.co/nxhn5lj9Iv

Bates said he didn't remember the photos. Bates said he only extracted the data from the phone. #MichelleCarter trial
During cross examination, the defense asked Bates about photos of nooses that Roy sent to #MichelleCarter, &amp; pics of guns, suicide methods
Two days later Roy sent #MichelleCarter a text &amp; said, "How was you day?"	She responded: "When are you doing it?"
Roy was unsure about taking his life &amp; #MichelleCarter said, "Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself, IDK theres a lot of ways."
"....So you'll have to prove me wrong," #MichelleCarter told a suicidal Conrad Roy.
Then #MichelleCarter suggested Roy take 10 Benedryls and then a bottle of tylenol, &amp; said, "I still don't think you want to do this..."
After Roy told #MichelleCarter how many pills he took, she said, "4000mg isn't enough. U purposely took a low dosage cuz u don't wanna die."
Roy: "I'm too scared. You're right I don't have it in me.:	#MichelleCarter: "Just swallow all of them," she said of the pills.
The next day #MichelleCarter said: "Well you gonna do it tonight or not?"	Roy: "I don't think I have it in me."	Carter: "I knew it!"
Roy tried using tylenol and a full bottle of nyquil to overdose, he said over text to #MichelleCarter.
#MichelleCarter said, "That's why you have to do something quick that will end w/o having to worry about the pain."
Roy said to #MichelleCarter that he was scared and didn't want his suicide to be painful.
But when Roy backed out of his suicide plan again, #MichelleCarter said, "See that's what I mean you keep pushing it off."
Next Roy promised to come up w/ a new plan to kill himself and told #MichelleCarter "I'll prove you wrong."
"But apparently you don't. I feel played &amp; stupid," #MichelleCarter said to Roy.
#MichelleCarter further wrote: "You lied about the whole thing. You said you were gonna go to the woods I thought you really wanted to die."
#MichelleCarter continued in text to Roy: "I knew you weren't going to try hard. I feel like such an idiot. You didn't ever do anything."
Another day Roy text: "Sorry I took sleeping pills &amp; fell asleep."	#MichelleCarter: "So it didn't work? You said you wanted this bad."
For several days #MichelleCarter pressured Roy about killing himself, text messages show.
Roy: "I wish you could hold y hand through it."	#MichelleCarter: "I'd hold your had &amp; cry w/ you &amp; tell you how much I love you."
Roy: "What if suffocation does;t work?"	#MichelleCarter: "How bad do you want? Because if you want it bad you should succeed."
Roy: "Hard."	#MichelleCarter: "What way?"	Roy: "IDK LOL"	Carter: "I don't think you're really serious about this..."
The next day #MichelleCarter text Roy &amp; said, "Are you gonna do it tonight?"	Roy: "I'm gonna try."	Carter: "How hard are you gonna try?"
#michellecarter's next text was: "We should do something fun on Tuesday."
#michellecarter continued: "You don't anna die, you just want the pain to stop."	Roy: "That's true. I just don't know what to do w myself."
Roy: "You think I should?"		#MichelleCarter: "you're not gonna kill yourself. You say all the time you want to but look, you're still here."
In text exchange bwtn #MichelleCarter &amp; Roy, he wrote: "I keep regretting the past. It's getting me upset."		Carter: "Take your life?"
Prosecutor: "How would you describe their texting? Was it a lot?" she asks re  #MichelleCarter &amp; BF Conrad Roy	Bates: "A fair amount."
Bates extracted a video Conrad Roy made on 6/13/14. #michellecarter trial

RT @BostonGlobe: The battle over police body cameras in Boston is back in court today https://t.co/y7Wp0UWybs https://t.co/Oe7dImBEwL
Union aty: "It's an experiment," he says of body camera program
Respected police consultant said study union keeps referring to is not reliable.
Atty said that in referring to a study that said officers are at greater risk w/ body cameras.
union atty: "You dont just send out a thing while 8 officers are lying dead &amp; say increase your risks."
union atty: We didnt have a bargaining issue. we had a violation of a contract," he says re q's about why not going to arbitration
Union atty: If it took the commissioner a yr to come around to this why does he expect officers too?
Union atty: "If the program was so important why didnt they sell it?" He says of body cam program
Union attorney says there was " a reluctance at the top," for reason why no one volunteered. Commish Evans didn't really want to do it
Judge challenges union attorney re agreement that union leaders would ensure success of the body camera pilot program
"The issue is we don't know what;s going to happen when an officer walks down the street with that camera on..." says union attorney
Judge questions what exactly is the reparable harm re wearing body cameras?
Union attorney argues that "once a person is ordered to put on a camera &amp; walk down the street, irreparable harm has been done."
Union attorney reciting instances in which arbitration was needed, Says what the city did is a breach in agreement. Judge is questioning him
@bostonpolice Commissioner will not back down from camera fight: https://t.co/8yc7cSOkjT
City atty adds that the "safety of the public relies on it." Now time for closing arguments from attys for the union
City atty says the the prerogative of the police commissioner "is not meaningless and is a prerogative that must rest w/ the commish"
city atty says the city should not wait for arbitration before having body cameras
"If you add this all up, you have someone who has not lived up to their obligations," city atty says of union prez role re body cams
"The word was out to not volunteer," said city atty re body cameras
City atty says union prez Pat Rose claimed there was 1 volunteer for the body camera pilot, but he couldn't remember the cop's name
"That means saying more than we like it, we like it, we like it..." says city atty during closing arguments re body cameras
She said part of the agreement was that the "union will endeavor to assit in implementation of the body camera program" and....
City atty responds that the "volunteer issue is a result of how the union participated."
Judge Douglas Wilkins q's whether city has proven the doctrine of unclean hands re the union's role in lack of volunteers
City atty says union Prez Pat Rose told his union reps not to volunteer for body camera program during a June mtg
It doesn't matter then whether the officers are assigned or are volunteers
City atty challenging a study the union used that said officers with cameras are subject to more assaults said....
Atty continues: "He had the right to assign" body cameras.
"He has a right to do it," city atty says. "There was an agreement for volunteers. There were no volunteers at the end of the day."
City attny argues the court does not have the right to intervene in body camera debate. Also evidence union may have breached this agreement
Evans has stepped down from the stand. Arguments to begin between attorneys
Evans said prior to July body cam agreement w/ the unions, union prez had gone above his head to city hall, cutting him out of equation
"Body cameras would decrease confrontation with the public because both know they are being filmed," Evans said re body cameras
@kennycooks Yes he was.
@bostonpolice Commish Evans explaining the body camera policy. Read it for yourself here: https://t.co/diGv1ppdY7
City atty walking Commish Evans thru way body camera policy was drafted and what it says.
Evan said purpose of police body camera pilot program "is to work out the pros &amp; cons, see what the benefits are of it... work out kinks."
Now, the city is questioning Evans. Cross-examination is over
Evans said he was "not going to rescind" his order. Officers &amp; supervisors had already been trained.
Evans said the union wanted him to go back to drawing board after he announced he would assign cams
Hmmm ... attorney for union uses @marty_walsh comments re body cams from this story: https://t.co/xOW2SM3xnP
Evans said video "bailed us out of a very heated situation. I really see the positives," he said pointing to 3 police-involved shootings
"They knew this was something I wanted," Evans said, adding the unions were very involved.
Union attorney grills Evans about his stance previously. "They knew this is a necessary piece of equipment."

This is the BPPA notice discouraging cops from volunteering for body camera program. https://t.co/9uvLUEwQve
Evans said there was conflict w/in the union's house of reps re body cameras and he suspects the prez got heat for signing deal w/ city
Evans said union prez Pat Rose stopped talking to him eventually and instead went to City Hall
Evans said no one should have been surprised about the body cameras coming. They knew.
Evans: "I was hoping to get it out in June and union negotiations held it up until Sept."
He said they are the ones taking guns off the street and have interactions with African-Americans
Evans said he wanted officers from the Youth Violence Strike Force to wear body cams cause they are the most active of the specialized units
If you're following the body camera debate in #boston you ought to read this: https://t.co/pJScKTLGJi
Horwitz asks about the impact such comments could have on officers wanting to volunteer to wear body cameras
Horwitz asks about advocates complaints about a volunteer body camera program who said such a program means "bad cops" would not volunteer
After #Dallaspolice shooting, Evans said he contacted union prez Pat Rose &amp; asked if he wanted 2 cops per car. They agreed best way
Evans said a police consultant did not give that report much credibility
Horwitz highlighting a study the union focused on that showed that officers were more likely to get attacked while wearing body cameras
Evans: "We did exactly what I said," he said re taking his time to vet body cams. "That's why we're here today rolling it out."
Horowitz: "That's been your focus all along getting it right?" She says re body cameras
When question about how the public will feel about the cameras while on crime scenes, Evans said the policy gives officers discretion

When asked why he negotiated with the unions, Evans said, "If you ask people to do something , they're more apt to do it."
Evans said, "I think it is my lawful authority as a police commissioner to assign officers [to wear body cameras]."
Evans says video of three recent police-involved shootings by #Bostonpolice helped keep the city calm and showed why officers opened fire
Evans: "I always thought [body cameras] was a tool, not a panacea..."
Evans admits that at first he was "luke warm" to body camera idea

Sooooo Rose says there were volunteers for body cameras.. "There was a volunteer... there were a couple of volunteers." That's a first
Rose: "We didn't want people to not want to wear them."
Rose: I wanted to make sure [body cameras] were bargained properly. I wanted to make sure their rights were protected."
Rose: There are a lot of unanswered questions about body cameras, even to this day
Rose: Encouraged city to get moving on body cameras because a successor collective bargaining agreement was approaching
