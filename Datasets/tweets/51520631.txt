What's being discussed are relative benefits of representative republics versus direct democracies.  No one is arguing that we should go to a direct democracy.  But a truly representative republic actually represents all citizens equally (as contemplated by Constitution) https://t.co/OpCykdmdam
I don't have a narrative.  I'm discussing empirical reality, i.e., that which can be proven by facts and reason.  Here are some facts and reasoning:	https://t.co/7g2Erjyd2Y https://t.co/6aXSYno0lY
This is some political fantasy you (and apparently many others) are living.  There is no tension between a republic and a democracy.  They are describing different aspects of a government. Republican is the form, democracy the mechanism. E.g., UK is a monarchy and democracy. https://t.co/RRSvtTkjJD
When a political party can only win through voter suppression, it does this. https://t.co/bVkFx1s281

I'll start by pushing back on the nonsense notion that a republic and a democracy are in conflict. This is simply not true, not supported by the most elemental political science. And, it's inherently irrational that a representative democracy can under represent the majority. https://t.co/qj8uICKIFb
That's a total cop out. It's not about Time magazine. You don't have even the most minimal objective rebuttal to the history explained in that article .  This historical information can be found in multiple other places. Google "electoral college and slavery" https://t.co/vK27VDSRf5
I don't think you're stupid.  You are not making empirical arguments even when presented with objective information for which you don't have a factual rebuttal. Uninformed, lacking critical reasoning skills, captured by ideology, all of the above? https://t.co/CaTMIFH6wJ
That is correct.  But nevertheless unstainable for the GOP to "win" elections with Russian help, gerrymandering, and widespread voter suppression.  We're living through a classic legitimacy crisis.  This is in part how the Roman Republic -conceptual basis for US- collapsed. https://t.co/DI3QOpzpaW
