I wrote about this problem and more in the latest #AskSara column, and I'd be grateful if you read it and told me your thoughts. https://t.co/SF5UExwQmh
But what would happen if we spent less time feeling guilty and stressed about our individual choices (like flying to see a sick relative) ... and more energy on action? 14/
It is also hard, and sometimes lonely, and definitely tedious, to do the political work (like writing letters, working on a campaign, organizing in your community) that's necessary to change the transportation system. 13/
It is hard and lonely to skip a wedding because you feel guilty about flying. And it's not clear (absent federal policy) that skipping that wedding will change anything. 12/
I definitely don't have all of the answers, but the ideas I keep circling around look like this: 11/
In the context of all of this, what is an individual supposed to do? How can you act as an ethical, engaged global citizen ... who sometimes is asked to fly, for example to visit a sick relative across the country? What about to attend a wedding? 10/
Heavy international regulations could address pollution from air travel, but as researcher Scott Cohen told me recently, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lack of appetite for that type of regulation, because mobility that‚Äôs facilitated by air travel is viewed as a fundamental human right." 9/
The problem is even stickier to solve at an international level. A train will never replace a flight over the Pacific Ocean. 8/
... and the trolling of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that emerged in response to the suggestion that the U.S. invest in high-speed rail to replace air travel. 7/
But government intervention of this sort is hard to pull off, politically speaking. Look at the news just from this week: Gavin Newsom canceling California's high-speed rail line between L.A. and San Francisco ... 6/
To reduce the climate impact of flying, we'd need most people to fly less. That means some sort of government intervention, like a carbon tax or heavy investment in railroads. 5/
The problem is that for every altruistic person who gives up flying, there are many, many others who don't. Planes still take off. The climate keeps warming. 4/
That's led some folks who care about climate change to give up flying. @EricHolthaus is one notable example. https://t.co/efdouSHjrG 3/
First, and most basic: Taking a long-distance flight is really harmful to the climate. Flying is among the most-polluting activities an individual can undertake. 2/

It's a template for having an honest and compassionate conversation with someone about how bad things really are -- and then making a plan together for what to do. 10/
In fact, one protocol is so great that I think that people who talk about climate change should borrow from it. 9/
They include steps like, "Listen to the patient and figure out what he or she already knows" and "Acknowledge and validate the patient's emotions." 8/
So in the past 30 years or so, doctors have developed step-by-step protocols for delivering bad news. These protocols are pretty good! 7/
But most patients actually do want to know if they have cancer. For one thing, it helps them prepare appropriately for the future. 6/
In some cases they actively concealed the diagnosis from the patient. 5/
They felt so uncomfortable about giving the news that they just ... wouldn't. 4/
Many Western doctors used to be terrrrrrible at this, to put it mildly. 3/
Sometimes, doctors have to give people bad news, like "You have cancer." 2/

@Jahnnymc I thought about that, but I really seeing daylight at the end of my working day.
I fully expect that waiting up for election returns tonight will be the death knell of this weird experiment. &lt;fin&gt;
Downsides: I am super confused about what the true time is. And right  now it's 9:45 a.m. and I'm already starting to get hungry for lunch. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Best part: When I stop working for the day, it's still light out.
This allows me to feel virtuous when I'm up "early" in the morning through no particular effort. Another benefit: My sleep schedule doesn't feel screwed up the way it usually does at the time change.
But for sleeping/eating, I'm still on daylight savings time.
Of course, to be a functional human, I still have to abide by the outside world's meeting times.
So when the time change came this past weekend, I decided I just wouldn't.
As a writer and editor, I'm def part of the gig economy, which has its pluses and minuses. One big plus: If I want to try weird experiments with my schedule, I am free to do so.

"So, here's the irony: toilets that are cleaned too often are more likely to be covered in fecal bacteria."
Over time, the fecal bacteria get out-competed by a community of microbes from our skin. But once you scrub the toilet again, Yong writes, "the communities go back to square one."
-Also, a practical matter: By trying to keep things really clean, we disrupt the balance of microbial ecosystems. A scientist named Sean Gibbons found that after you scrub public toilets, they're first colonized by fecal bacteria.
-When the same bacterium infects mosquitoes, it prevents them from carrying the dengue virus. So if we deliberately infect mosquitoes with Wolbachia, we might be able to reduce the spread of dengue fever, no insecticides required.
He treated the wasps with antibiotics, killing the Wolbachia. Some of the wasps became male and they started reproducing sexually. üò≤

It's already happening. ‚òπÔ∏è https://t.co/zcE8CLLlht https://t.co/sdewj0l2H4
@aditi0703 I agree ... and it's thanks to @aviandelights who thought of showing the data this way!
@Jake_in_the_Lab Here's some information about how the graph was created. It looks like it was created by Kenneth E. Kunkel, Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites. https://t.co/kMHcdBjsVc
3/ But there is some warming that is now inevitable, barring some major technological solution.
2/ You can see that some warming is still preventable by 2050 if we cut carbon pollution substantially. https://t.co/q8mK8zyS6Y
1/ I made a graphic a while ago that goes some way toward answering this question. It's based on a similar one by climate scientist @aviandelights, and it uses data from the U.S. National Climate Assessment from 2014 (so it's a few years out of date). https://t.co/vZ2CSf3eBi
Also, if anyone else in the Twitterverse has more ideas for Zoe, give us a shout. https://t.co/aXaUW0KfNV
Good luck! 4/4
And here's a group that's working on carbon farming with dairy farmers in Marin County, California.  https://t.co/oAQaAmgG1v 3/4
Here's an article that summarizes the concept. https://t.co/kO2z4WI331 2/4
Hi Zoe, 	This is an area that I'm not as familiar with. But I'd suggest looking into "carbon farming," which is the practice of sequestering carbon in soils through deliberate farming practices. 1/4 https://t.co/aXaUW0KfNV
18/ If you and your friend really want to dig into this, I recommend the excellent book "The Water Will Come," by @jeffgoodell, which focuses to a large degree on South Florida. https://t.co/W7ux3KPmce
17/ This study, for example, found that home values in low-lying areas of Miami-Dade have been appreciating more slowly than those at higher elevations. https://t.co/wVRveBJ993
16/ Final thought: There is some evidence that home values are already being affected.
15/ Source: https://t.co/WBgjdSBeGz
14/ "Unlike the recent experience, homeowners will have no expectation that the values of their homes will ever recover.‚Äù
13/ ‚ÄúA large share of homeowners' wealth is locked up in their equity in their homes. If those homes become uninsurable and unmarketable, the values of the homes will plummet, perhaps to zero.
12/ "The economic losses and social disruption may happen gradually, but they are likely to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing crisis and Great Recession.
11/ "While technical solutions may stave off some of the worst effects of climate change, rising sea levels and spreading flood plains nonetheless appear likely to destroy billions of dollars in property and to displace millions of people.
10/ And your friend doesn't have to take it from me. She might respond better to mortgage giant Freddie Mac, which had this to say in April 2016:
9/ But the key, as you allude to in your question, is that long before houses actually go completely underwater, people will start selling, if only because it won't be such a great place to live anymore.
8/ You and she might find it useful to play around with this interactive map from @ClimateCentral. https://t.co/FAevdb5eBi
7/ So to answer your question more directly, I would say that I don't know exactly when your friend's house will go underwater.
6/ I talked to one guy who was trying to sell his house not just because he's worried about it going underwater someday, but because his quality of life has already decreased as a result of flooding and construction. https://t.co/qL5LMXvkKh
5/ But the people I talked to were pretty stressed. They seemed to worry all the time about bad traffic caused by those construction projects -- and by the floods that still happen despite the construction efforts.
4/ As you've probably heard, Miami Beach has been undertaking a huge initiative to lift roads by two feet, so Alton Road actually doesn't flood as badly anymore.
3/ You can see what it looks like in this supremely silly video from six years ago of a man paddleboarding down Alton Road, the main drag on the island. https://t.co/jdKomLLWZz
2/ People there are ALREADY really stressed about rising sea levels. It's not a future problem. It's a today problem, because the water is already flooding streets.

@zoe_samuel Thanks for your question! Oh boy, I have thoughts on this. I'll send them your way tomorrow.
23/ So some cities are starting to plant trees as a way to help people stay healthy as the climate warms. Here's an example from Louisville. Chime in, y'all, if you know of a city in NC doing this. https://t.co/l0JNe7xhaL
22/ It sounds hokey, but trees do a spectacular job of cooling their immediate area and also soaking up air pollution like ozone.
21/ One cool thing we can also do is to get involved in community tree-planting efforts.
20/ It doesn't have to be this way. There's plenty of things we can do, obviously and most importantly implementing policies that reduce carbon pollution.
19/ Citation: USGCRP, 2016: The Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States: A Scientific Assessment. Crimmins, A., J. et al., Eds. U.S. Global Change Research Program, Washington, DC, 312 pp. https://t.co/wa6zNzXda1
18/ By 2030! That is uncomfortably soon.
17/ On the extra ozone pollution resulting from climate change, one study estimated that nationwide, "tens to thousands of additional ozone-related premature deaths per year" could occur by 2030.
16/ Citation: Wu J, Zhou Y, Gao Y, Fu JS, Johnson BA, Huang C, Kim YM, Liu Y. 2014. Estimation and uncertainty analysis of impacts of future heat waves on mortality in the eastern United States. Environ Health Perspect 122:10‚Äì16; https://t.co/4rE7lJ9q5G
15/ BUT one study estimated that extra heat waves from climate change could cause an average of 2,400 deaths every year just on the East Coast by the late 2050s.
14/ I don't have numbers in front of me about the number of people who could be affected by this in NC.
13/ So, bottom line, my biggest health concerns are related to hotter days and more ozone pollution.
11/ Here in North Carolina, one my biggest concerns is ground-level ozone. It's a pollutant that we deal with every summer, especially on hot, sunny days.
10/ Heat also tends to make air pollution worse. (Isn't that annoying?)
9/ But it also can make people with certain chronic conditions even sicker, because heat is stressful to our bodies. I'm talking about conditions like heart disease and diabetes. Everyone knows someone with one of these conditions.
8/ Heat is a health problem not just because it can directly cause medical issues like heat stroke (which is certainly a worry).
7/ My biggest concern for North Carolina looking forward is that we're likely to keep getting hotter. https://t.co/LqfnhTcULP
6/ In other words, the number of miserably hot days has more than doubled in my lifetime. And I‚Äôm not that old!
5/ When I was a little girl, there were about eight days every summer over 95 degrees in the Raleigh-Durham area. Today, we‚Äôre averaging about 20 extremely hot days each year.
4/ And when I checked the data collected at the RDU airport, I found out that my recollections were correct. Extremely hot days have gotten more common here.
3/ But looking back on it, the summers back in the'90s weren't as bad as they are now. Turning on the A/C was a somewhat rare event for my family. I spent the summer of '99 living in a dorm room in Winston-Salem without A/C. It was OK.
2/ When I was a kid growing up in Durham, summers were pretty hot. My brothers and I spent pretty much every afternoon in the pool to escape the heat. (RIP my fair skin.)
This is a great question, and it's one that's super personal for me, because I grew up in NC and still live here. 1/many https://t.co/9KGwfxCocG

Heat stroke is an emergency. If someone has a high body temperature, has stopped sweating, or is confused or unconscious, call 911 (or your local emergency number outside the U.S.).
Check on older adults to make sure they are able to stay cool.
Monitor your local air quality, because air pollution can get worse in hot weather. Air quality alerts often appear alongside the weather report.
Wear light-colored, loose-fitting clothing.
If you can, schedule exercise or play time for cooler parts of the day.
Seek relief in air-conditioned buildings. Many communities offer cooling centers in libraries and other public spaces.
If you are playing or working outdoors, take breaks to cool down under shade. 		If you supervise people who are playing or working in hot weather, offer ample opportunities for them to take breaks and drink water.
What you can do: Drink water. Your body cools itself by sweating, so by staying hydrated, you help your body do its job.
Anyone can get sick in hot weather, but people who are especially vulnerable include: 	-adults over 65	-children	-outdoor workers	-homeless people 	-pregnant women	-low-income people	-people with chronic conditions such as heart problems, breathing trouble, and mental illness

13/ In conclusion, on a planetary scale, your butt is irrelevant. Your member of Congress is not.
12/ And what really, really matters is politics. Family cloth: Negligible impact. Your leaders deciding to allow coal plants to stay online for the next 20 years: Enormous impact.
11/ Those things are your car, your plane flights, your meat consumption, and (controversially) how many kids you have. https://t.co/wwB2rTntm9
10/ But we don't NEED to know the exact numbers in this debate, because we already know what really matters to your personal climate impact.
9/ It's extremely likely that if we ran the numbers on toilet paper vs. family cloth, we'd get a similar result.
8/ Both cloth AND disposable diapers have environmental costs, in terms of raw resources, energy, water, and climate pollution, and when you add those all up, there isn't a clear winner.
7/ That's mostly because of the huge environmental footprint of cotton, which is used to make cloth diapers. https://t.co/8lu5FgZfuz
6/ Here's why. This question in some ways resembles the cloth diapers vs. disposables debate. Researchers have looked into it and found ... it doesn't make much difference.
5/ I would like to offer reassurance: Your butt is not important, so keep it clean however you would like.*		*Your butt may matter for local pollution issues, but for the climate, it truly doesn't.
4/ So now you may be wondering, "Do I have to give up toilet paper in order to prevent the Earth from becoming a fiery hellscape?"
3/ Buzzfeed interviewed a woman who says she started using family cloth to yes, reduce the climate impact of her butt. https://t.co/IcRri8WS4o
2/ "Family cloth," according to Buzzfeed, is cloth that some families use instead of toilet paper to wipe after going to the bathroom. https://t.co/8R13QU3WJY

9/ You can argue there's no "ideal" temperature for a planet, but the one we had (until recently) was what every living being and every human civilization had adapted to, rather exquisitely.
8/ That's the problem with Scott Pruitt's question: ‚ÄúDo we know what the ideal surface temperature should be in the year 2100 or year 2018?‚Äù https://t.co/m9yteUaGb5
7/ But we probably wouldn't like most of the consequences. Many species (like birds) might die out, and a lot of things would break (like elevators).
6/ If the strength of gravity increased in a relatively short period of time, there might be a few benefits. (Maybe thefts of TVs would decrease, because the TVs would be heavier and more difficult to move.)
5/ But you probably would consider that every species on the planet and every aspect of our civilization has adapted to something close to today's strength of gravity.
4/ It could have easily been weaker (like on the Moon) or stronger (like on Jupiter), if the Earth had formed differently.
3/ You might reason that there's nothing objectively "perfect" about Earth's current gravity.
2/ Also imagine that scientists have noticed that the strength of gravity at Earth's surface is increasing.
THREAD ALERT. 1/ Imagine someone says this: ‚ÄúDo we know what the strength of surface gravity should be in the year 2100 or year 2018? It‚Äôs fairly arrogant for us to think we know exactly what it should be in 2100.‚Äù

But the publication of Friday's column is a good reason for experts to lose confidence in the work of the media, which is dangerous, too.
That's not to say I take what experts say as God's truth, of course. I (and they) are aware that everyone makes mistakes.
And when one of the most important newspapers in the world publishes a grossly misleading column about climate change, how can I blame them?
Those same experts sometimes distrust members of the media and don't believe I will seek the truth and report it to the best of my ability.
My job often involves getting experts to trust me ‚Äî to believe me when I say I will report on science accurately.

@cgoldfish All the while, they suck the toddler's blood and create new eggs for him to poop out. #circleoflife, etc.
@cgoldfish Then it's a short ride to the small intestine, where they turn into grownup hookworms, where they can live for several YEARS.
@cgoldfish Then they're in the lungs. They crawl up to the pharynx and our lovely toddler swallows them.
@cgoldfish ... until it gets TO THE LUNGS. Then it and its other hookworm friends poke their way from the blood vessels through the alveoli.
@cgoldfish Then comes the really interesting/horrifying part. The larva is carried in the bloodstream around in the body ...
@cgoldfish The hookworm larva is very small ‚Äî microscopic. It penetrates the skin on the sole of the beautiful toddler's feet.
@cgoldfish The dreamy toddler, to a hookworm, looks like a beautiful new home where it can live forever and get free food.
@cgoldfish Once they reach this stage, the larvae can penetrate human skin. Imagine a barefoot toddler, dreamily wandering in the grass.
@cgoldfish Once they're done molting, the hookworms are called filariform larvae. I hope they get bar mitzvahs or confirmation ceremonies.
@cgoldfish Do they experience something like growing pains with molting? Is molting embarrassing? Do the other hookworms mock them?
@cgoldfish It's probably not scientific at all, but I like to think of the hookworm molting as being a bit like puberty in humans.
@cgoldfish A small creature called a rhabditiform larva crawls out. They grow in the poop or in the soil, and they molt twice.
@cgoldfish If the pile of poop is properly cozy (moist, warm, shaded), the hookworm egg will hatch within two days.
@cgoldfish It begins its life as a simple egg resting in a pile of poop. Disgusting yes, but this is Nature's Way.
@cgoldfish The mighty hookworm's life cycle is in some ways more complicated than a person's. It goes through stages.

6/ ... not to mention the icky vector-borne diseases like Zika, West Nile Virus, and Lyme disease that will see changed ranges
5/  ... and #climate change makes respiratory diseases (like asthma) worse, in part because smog forms more easily in hot weather
4/ ... and BTW heat waves already cause more deaths in the U.S. than all other extreme weather events combined ...

15/ For more on this, I recommend the quite readable National Climate Assessment https://t.co/4MHLDKwBJM
14/ The most credible science on this issue suggests that warming will cause yield growth to slow, not grow.
13/ "... and the CO2 isn't going to be sufficiently beneficial to compensate.‚Äù
12/ There's an "awful lot of the world" where people "are going to be hurt by the warming ..."
11/ I also called one of the scientists who appeared in the original "Greening" film. His name is Bruce Kimball. Here's what he said:
10/ ‚ÄúA developing soybean pod is like a baby of any other variety. It‚Äôs pretty delicate, and if you overheat it, you can kill it.‚Äù
9/ Here's how scientist @aleakey77 at U of Illinois described to me what happens to soybeans when they get hot:
8/ Guess what corn, rice, wheat, soy, etc., are? SEEDS.
7/ So with rising CO2, we might see bigger plants, but their seeds won't grow as well or will even fail to grow at all.
6/ There are a LOT of things wrong with that idea, but here's the main one: Hot temperatures screw up plant reproduction
5/ It features researchers who claim that rising CO2 will cause increased yields because CO2 acts like a plant fertilizer.
4/ "Greening" was funded by the Western Fuels Association, which is ... wait for it ... a coal trade group.

Eilperin predicts one of the first votes McConnell will call will be on #KXL pipeline.
Eilperin: The only possible Republican candidate who MIGHT address climate change is Jeb Bush.
Eilperin: Environmental groups spent a huge amount of money on Kay Hagan.
Eilperin: The coming fight on environmental issues will set up a very serious debate for 2016.
Eilperin: For a president who has rarely issued vetoes, the environment is one area in which Obama is willing to fight.
Eilperin: Obama came to see in his second term that climate change was a legacy issue for him.
Eilperin: All of this is happening at the moment when the president is most committed to acting on environmental issues
... dealing with subpoenas, going to hearings takes time, and EPA is running out of time to do the things it wants to do in 2 years
Eilperin: Republicans can have the biggest impact on EPA, NOAA, other agencies through oversight ...
Eilperin: Congress might block new EPA ozone rule during this lame duck session.
Eilperin: If Republicans can slow down implementation and also win the next presidential race, Clean Power Rule could disappear.
Eilperin: And budget cuts will make things even more challenging.
Eilperin: If states want to punt on Clean Power Plan, almost nothing the feds can do to force them to engage with emissions cuts
Eilperin: States are supposed to be implementing Clean Power Plan. But just as with healthcare law, that can cause problems when they refuse
Eilperin: Based on feedback from states, EPA will retool Clean Power Plan.
Eilperin: Murkowski may become very important power broker. The White House could talk to her on climate issues.
Eilperin: Murkowski a moderate Republican, is invested in the idea of climate adaptation. She acknowledges rapid climate change in Arctic.
Eilperin: There's no question McConnell will force votes on Keystone pipeline.
Eilperin: McConnell has crusaded against EPA for years.
Eilperin: Inhofe says global warming is both a hoax and a benefit to agriculture.

Hulme: response to ozone hole is a "very poor analogy" for framing of climate change. #CPCC2012
@erinacb Yes, talking about uncertainties as a reason to do nothing is a rhetorical strategy that evades discussion of values
In fact skeptics seem to exploit this assumption, using gaps in knowledge to defer action. #CPCC2012
Hulme: climate change community assumes knowledge leads to action; does not question this assumption enough #CPCC2012

Firestone: during the summer, offshore #wind generates the most electricity during the hottest hours #unc
Schiavinato: We need a comprehensive #wind energy bill in N.C. to determine who is in charge, regulatory certainty. #unc
Firestone: N.C. is externalizing environmental damages. This state get to keep beautiful mountains while buying W. Va. #coal. #wind #unc
Firestone: constraints to #wind are policy and social, not technological. "We've got a real blockade at the federal level." #unc
Lisa Schiavinato: N.C. still needs to work out the kinks of permitting, oversight before state can bring in #wind.
Seim: many areas off the coast haven't actually had #wind speed measured at the height of a wind turbine #unc
Harvey Seim, prof of marine sciences at #UNC: One conflict for #wind in N.C.: the military #unc
O'Hara: Construction of #wind in N.C. would cost 24% less than N.Y., N.J., Mass., according to EIA #unc
O'Hara: But low labor costs in N.C. could translate to lower #wind costs than in other states. #unc
O'Hara: One obstacle to #wind in N.C.: cheap #coal. The state has very low electricity costs already. #unc
O'Hara: Still, N.C. has enough capacity to potentially export #wind power. #unc
O'Hara: N.C. also the third largest electricity consumer on East Coast. N.Y. has twice the population, but uses only a little more. #wind
O'Hara: N.C. has by far the largest #wind resource on the East Coast #unc
O'Hara: in 2008, N.C. spent $2.35 billion on out-of-state coal (2nd highest in U.S.) #wind
O'Hara: in 2008, state spent $2.35 billion on out-of-state coal (2nd highest in U.S.) #wind
Brian O'Hara, NC Offshore Wind Coalition: NC gets 55% of energy from coal, 34.5% from nuclear. #wind #unc
Firestone: Loan guarantees should be given to developers with contracts, not manufacturers like #solyndra. #unc
Firestone: Europe has 3,000 MW of #wind already with another 3,000 MW under construction #unc
Firestone: Cape Wind is the most notorious wind project in the world. #unc
Jeremy Firestone, U of Delaware: mandating utilities to buy green energy is good strategy for #wind. #unc #sierraclub #offshore wind
I'm at #sierraclub #offshore #wind panel. Larry Shirley, NC Dept of Commerce says wind is "one of our highest priorities" for green economy
