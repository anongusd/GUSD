@the_feral1 @siano2020 @AOC Ok, I can understand that. Let's do it?
@siano2020 @AOC Agreed. I think it should be stressed that the US economy was doing really well during our highest tax periods. (Correct me if I'm wrong). Also, today's minimum wage has not kept up with inflation, so the MW can't be blamed for driving up prices. Lots of faulty logic around.
@siano2020 @AOC Also please consider putting a $1 flat tax (for example) on stock transactions. This wouldn't be felt by stockholders (where brokers charge a whole lot more for transactions), and would help generate extra revenue for decreasing the deficit. May also decrease fluctuation.

@Ocasio2018 There is nothing more that I'd like to see than for an elected official to do his/her job of representing the people, and through that climb the salary ladder. Natural. Problem: Need to remove the conflicts-of-interest from politics, and add in accountability. How do we do that?
@WisePaxCat @Slate And he has no lips in that photo. What's left of 'em looks "burnt orange". Did you do that on purpose, or is it just a happy coincidence?
@RoKhanna I'm sure its working for the top ultra rich.  Removing the conflicts-of-interest from politics and policy decision making would be a good thing. A GOOD thing. Corporate politics has proven itself to be inefficient and immoral. It's tearing our country apart.
@Ocasio2018 @RoKhanna I totally agree. "Towing the party line" is not only undemocratic, but obsolete as a political strategy. Rural broadband for me is not just an initiative, it's imperative. The US depends on its farmers and ranchers. Let's take care of them.
@swkoti We are not destroyed yet buddy. A tiny part of me thinks we needed the Trump phenomenon in order to clearly draw a line between what is right (taking care of people, all people) and what is wrong (hatred + placing government in corporate hands).  Draw the line. Thicken it.

@Dave_Hile Is it too many guns? Or an anguished society? Or not enough mental care? In any case, the answers are PROGRESSIVE answers.  That means we need to look an the problems and address them without infringing on the rights of the masses.  It is difficult. But it can be done. Do it.
@JCatenaci @Onlymej @BernieSanders What is really great in a for profit system is how the insurance companies contest EVERYTHING, even if its something they cover. The smallest pretext is game for putting extra hurdles and paperwork between a patient and reimbursement. The goal is to wear people down.

@ChasingOzPhotog I wonder what would happen if they found a "super-horny" prescription pill for women? Do you think that would be suppressed? ☺️☺️☺️
@MEirik @B4gfisch @Onlymej @BernieSanders They can't believe it. If U truly understood what it's like N the US....even when U have medical insurance, it doesn't cover many things. And even when the contract says your covered 4 something, they (the insurance company) will routinely contest your coverage under any pretext.
@BaliBuddha24 @BernieSanders Well shit, what did Bernie do to you then?
@BaliBuddha24 @BernieSanders I call BS. @BernieSanders has been putting single payer healthcare on the table for years and years. And I'm not a fiction to him, but to you. 		Single payer systems are cheaper and provide better medical outcomes than the obsolete US system. It's simple really.
@Gizmo89585055 @Onlymej @BernieSanders He didn't.  He just can't imagine walking into a clinic, handing your healthcard to staff, he/she putting it n2 card reader, getting care, then leaving without pulling 1$ fromyour billfold. Americans, why R the French more deserving of healthcare than U R? Ask yourself that.
Single payer systems are just more efficient. It's risk pooling. It's being able to negotiate prices. This is not ideology! This is simple math! https://t.co/6hGI9ufTvA
@Onlymej @BernieSanders I know a little girl who was lucky enough 2 B French. She was born w/a rare disorder, lacking precursor 2 insulin +other things. Keeping her alive the 1st yr cost &gt;20k€/month. She's 18 now, happy, good at school, full of promise. Would she b alive if she had been born n the US?
@BernieSanders @BernieSanders is right.  Common guys!! If France can do it, there is no reason why we can't. A single payer system is much more efficient than all the BS that doctors and patients have to deal with in the US today. Risk pooling works. It's just math. Simple math.

@BigDave31297295 @Julesbilly @MMFlint One more thing. I'm pretty sure all USA citizens are "nationals", and thanking God that only a few are "nationalists".  Thanks goodness!!
@BigDave31297295 @Julesbilly @MMFlint And yet they are not the same words. Nationalism refers to exalting one nation above all others. What is wrong with Patriotism???  I like it.  Nationalism on the other hand, caused a world war.... it has a lot of historical baggage that we don't need.
@BetoORourke Well I can't physically be in Texas right now, but I send in my absentee ballot a while back.  I just checked the FPCA ballot tracker, and my vote ballot is declared as "received", so all looks well. That's one more vote for you, @BetoORourke
@BigDave31297295 @MMFlint Nationalist is literally the "Na" in "Nazi".  It means that u think ur country is superior 2 other countries, thus entitling acts of hatred towards "the other".

@JoaquinCastrotx @artpace Art is the gateway to the soul.  Keep it up.
@HillReporter You dipsh***. Beto hasn't had a strong showing already?  Win or lose, he's changing the country. Get used to it. @BetoORourke  is here to stay. America is changing and that is not going away. This is only the beginning.
@MSNBC @craigmelvin Don't knock the kid, he's showing great spirit. Bash the system. The USA is a 3rd world country.  We'll spend oodles on 1000+ military bases across the planet, but our own children have to sell pumpkins for a service dog. What the **** does a European worker have that we don't?
RT @BernieSanders: We need an economy that works for the many, not just the few and that allows workers to retire with dignity and security…
@Daybreaker77 I cant make it but if I could I'd paint BETO on the inside of my shirt and then flip that baby once I'm in and the cameras are panning around.  No signs.  Yeah whatever.
@richardcantu5 @tedcruz Hi Richard Cantu! I see that u r military. Did u know that we pay taxes so that everyone benefits from the protection provided by the military?  That is socialism!  just like public schools!  I support veterans and want better 4 them just like @BetoORourke &amp; u should too
@tedcruz Our teachers are threatened. Our health is threatened. Our agriculture is threatened. Block-Head-Ted has got to go.
@tedcruz Here is some simple common sense: It's normal to own a gun when you're not crazy and don't have history of violence. +training (more gun clubs, why not?) Thorough background checking is normal.  I really don't see what the big deal is.
@TVietor08 @BetoORourke I say he keeps it all.  And if he doesn't make senate, well then he keeps the left overs and runs for president.
@MSNBC The guy wants to ban corporate money during elections. That's good!  Let him infiltrate the swamp!
@USArmy @ArmyChiefStaff Hi. I'm a progressive. I'm voting for @BetoORourke in Texas. And I deeply respect our military. Beto has done a lot of work to help veterans in Texas, and it's one of the reasons he has my vote.  I just wanted to let you know that party lines are changing a bit.
@maryephill @tedcruz @BetoORourke And I'll happily pay 25 cents per gallon to increase public education in Texas!!!!
@maryephill @tedcruz I agree.  What kind of human being can actually support violence against women?  Plus, we really need health care and better pay for our school teachers NOW.  The economy is up for certain people, but not for teachers?  What kind of a shit world is that?  I'm voting @BetoORourke
