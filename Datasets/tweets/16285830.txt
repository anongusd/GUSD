Can you imagine the scene in which CSAF and SecAF are like, "murr, we don't have a requirement for it" while then-SecDef Mattis is looking down at some papers on his desk.		Then he looks up at them.		Very.		Slowly.

And much of the time F-35 doesn't need to go active with AN/APG-81 -- although supposedly it has low probability of intercept and/or it has its own ECM capabilities if needed. But F-35 has an electro-optical system that enables it to sense without broadcasting
... the video depicts how the Navy, especially, wants to use its F-35C. Not necessarily as a shooter but as part of a network of ships and aircraft that all work together. F-35 might not even release a weapon (let's say) but permit another ship or aircraft to shoot
F-35 scans scan scans ... and then you can see how it detects contacts but continues searching ... then it beams some beamy beams to the other aircraft, and they beam some beams off to other platforms and a ground unit, etc. All this electro-wizardry good, boosters argue

@FormerDirtDart @NextNavy @thinkdefence @nicholadrummond @navybook @DavidLarter Big time. What these concepts (per @NextNavy) reinforce is much of the time, in many places, a warship is overkill.

@NextNavy @thinkdefence @FormerDirtDart @nicholadrummond @navybook @DavidLarter Yes it flies under the radar to an amazing degree. Which seems to suggest it's actually really operationally valuable orrrrrrr that it actually is not at all. We'll have to wait for the inevitable SEAL tell-all memoirs to know for sure
@thinkdefence @FormerDirtDart @nicholadrummond @NextNavy @navybook @DavidLarter I follow you. How often do UK SOF operate today in maritime environments? We used to hear a lot about the SAS during the late unpleasantness, but in Iraq &amp; A'stan. Do Brit special operators do this work today (for example in HoA) or would new ship open up that possibility?
@thinkdefence @FormerDirtDart @nicholadrummond @NextNavy @navybook @DavidLarter To be more specific, there are a lot of ne'er-do-wells in the Horn of Africa and in Yemen etc who require special attention from JSOC and Naval Special Warfare.

@Jpetrou2 @ConsWahoo @DavidLarter @HerbCarmen One idea (tho not phrased this way) in ProPub is low-level subjective validation. They *were* tracking *some* contacts. Bridge watchstanders on starboard side were actually spotting vessels, too. But crew believed only what it tracked and evidently didn't think there was more
@ConsWahoo @DavidLarter @HerbCarmen Fair characterization -- idea I'm trying to express was complacency as described in the reports. Watchstanders evidently thought they had a good handle about shipping in the channel but didn't
@KToropin @DavidLarter @HerbCarmen The gray zone of jackedupedness convergence. ISIC jackedupedness flowing down. Micro level flowing up. Who could have looked up in this scenario and seen an adult who would show disruptive leadership? No one -- all the way up to the TYCOM and beyond, it appears
@DavidLarter @HerbCarmen It cray. And per ProPub (altho some tech aspects not clear) CIC was truly, in the classic Navy phrase, "alone and unafraid" in a situation in which it should have been neither, given the complacency about those sensors. And what other wisdom does Chief teach? Complacency kills
@DavidLarter @HerbCarmen ... because even if the surface sets on 62 hadn't been degraded or in some cases INOP per the reports, it's not clear based on the official and other reports whether the bubbas in Combat actually knew how to employ them to, at very least, keep good situational awareness
@DavidLarter @HerbCarmen Sounds legit. What I struggle with in both the 62 and 56 mishaps is what appears to be the egregious shortfall in watchstander skill. They not only can't repair their own equipment, they kind of don't know how to operate it in the first place. Seems unthinkable.
@HerbCarmen @DavidLarter It's so difficult. I can only imagine being a new CO who had eaten all the SWO sh*t for years and dealt with being XO and juuuuust fleeted up to the big job and feeling like Adm Nelson himself and not wanting to look like a sh*tbag to the DESRON or the fleet
@DavidLarter This is the micro-level jackedupedness flowing up. Interpersonal problems that should have been set aside. Misplaced confidence of the CO in critical officers on the bridge and in combat. The poor sailor on the helm standing her first watch ever for a critical transit
@DavidLarter That's the damnable misery of it. Per ProPub, Navy Times and other stories, the JOs *did* know -- they did second-guess, etc. But what are you gonna do? Easy for Denzel Washington to challenge Gene Hackman in the movies. Most officers, most of the time? Nope
@DavidLarter Yes, this, a thousand times this ‚òùÔ∏è-- and scale it up -- think how often policymakers unthinkingly say, "we're ready to fight tonight," "we've got the finest force of all time," etc and act on faith based on those assumptions. DDG 62 and DDG 56 couldn't fight a garbage scow
If I were a hostile naval intelligence service, however, what I'd brief to my commanders after digesting all the DDG 62 reports is that the U.S. Navy isn't "The Hunt for Red October," it's actually "The Office" -- and to lean in accordingly as necessary
Did the Surface Navy show it could operate, bro, during that time? Obvs -- Libya, Syria and other examples, incl DDG 87 swatting down cruise missiles in the Bab el Mandeb. The terrifying question is whether more of it, however, looks like DDG 87 or DDG 62 (or DDG 56)
Even if it got Back To Basics and Took A Fix vis a vis elementary nav/shiphandling, that evidently didn't take. More than 10 years after the then-infamous CG 65 and DDG 55 INSURV reports, parts of the fleet are *still* hollow, thanks in no small part to leadership failures
Why do uniformed and DoN civilian leaders tell Congress this isn't a money issue? Per DDG 62 it obviously is -- even if Big Navy "bought back" billets over the past few years, the ship didn't benefit.
The struggle here is macro-level jackedupedness -- too few sailors, poor material condition, unresponsive ISIC -- flowing down into micro-level jackedupedness, e.g. OOD, intra-crew politics, distrust. DDG 62 gapped and patched right up until the moment it couldn't https://t.co/kVE7LQcHM0

For those of us who've watched the story from the outside and even ventured to speculate about it based on past experience, it was, as others -- especially Navy Times -- have since affirmed: Even worse than feared
Takeaway: An irreparably dysfunctional bureaucracy, despite far and away the world's largest budget of its kind, set up its own people to fail and when put into danger, they did.

The poor Navy was, in one sense, historically unlucky. It did have a visionary CNO. It did have a surge in wartime funding. But how did it use that vision and that opportunity? As VCRs were taking off, it pushed in all its chips on Betamax.
The biggest challenges here are not technological but organizational and, ultimately, political. Not only would you need a SecNav and a CNO willing to pursue this vision but their successors and their successors as well. And moving away from CVNs is politically very difficult

Here, BTW, is the ODNI's opening statement as prepared: https://t.co/zyErqCULNE
SSCI (and HPSCI) are simulacra of oversight. Qs&amp;As but guardrails fence off many subjects. We prolly won't hear today, for example, about loss of CIA human sources in China (or elsewhere), loss of NSA cyber-tools, etc.
We're now into Q&amp;A. Burr is asking FBI and NSA about cyber threats. Yes, they're a threat, the IC bosses say. FBI Director Wray says nation states enlist the help of criminal hackers "in a blended threat way -- a form of outsourcing that makes it more of a menace."
Coats also warns about the threat to orbital infrastructure from other spacefaring powers. The United States depends on space for so much national power and the perils from new anti-satellite systems compel a whole range of responses to preserve that edge
Cuba, Russia and to a lesser extent, China, are expected to continue to try to prop up Maduro in Venezuela, Coats says. Those powers want to support a fellow traveler but also, he says, want access to oil.
Only The Best Go North üëá https://t.co/KlbbstvSXo
Coats turns to Syria, where he sez strongman Bashar Assad has largely defeated opposition, tho pockets of anti-regime and ISIS fighters remain. They'll continue to stoke violence there, he says, but the strategic page appears to have turned in Syria
With respect to North Korea, Kim Jong Un is open to ongoing negotiations and has dismantled some nuclear infrastructure, Coats says, but the IC assesses that Pyongyang probably will never agree to give up nuclear weapons b/c the regime views them as essential to survival
Coats turns now to China: Beijing is going to further try to solidify its regional control in the WestPac and Asia and also attempt to strengthen its global position. Its goal is to overtake the United States, he sez
Coats singles out ongoing threat from influence operations -- foreign malefactors are expected to intensify their efforts in the 2020 presidential race, he warns, and the powers (not just Russia) are learning from each other's experiences since the big wave in 16
You can tune in here to SSCI's ongoing hearing and at some point the committee also is expected to post the text of Coats' opening statement, which he is delivering now. Standard warning about multiplicity of complex threats, etc. https://t.co/eNKQmKMxwl
Seldom-seen Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats has been recognized for his opening statement, which he'll deliver on behalf of the IC bosses. The IC is trying to stay out of politics and "keep our heads down" to give the truth to intel consumers, he sez
... Warner concludes by reminding his hearers about the threat from China, citing yesterday's Huawei charges. But the challenge -- of economic spying and of national security espionage -- is only going to grow, he says.
Warner: Unacceptable that so many of your employees were disrupted by the recent shutdown. The work of the intelligence agencies -- including those he represents in Va, including CIA and NGA -- too important for these kinds of political games, he says.
"When this country's democracy was attacked in 2016, it wasn't with a bomb or a missile or a plane," Burr says. "It was with a social media account that any 13 year-old can open up for free."
Likely topics today: Historic strategic threat from Chinese espionage; North Korea's nuclear program; international -- especially Russian -- influence campaigns targeting the United States ... maybe some Iran ... maybe some terrorism for old time's sake?
The barons of espionage are under the klieg lights today in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The DNI &amp; bosses of CIA, FBI, DIA, NSA and NGA are appearing before Chairman Burr, Vice Chairman Warner &amp; co. They're going to talk about worldwide threats

RT @romuhammad: @philewing Nope... something needs to change and quickly
The 2017 mishaps revealed that no matter how impressive the ships seemed from a distance, they were plagued by unfilled billets, intra-wardroom personal drama, under-trained crew and broken gear. Still. After years of internal Navy investigations into the Surface Force
... or could you, at this point, get an effective force at *any* cost given the deep-seated cultural and bureaucratic dysfunction exposed by the 2017 mishaps and the Navy Times description of the Fort study? Could you buy it at any cost?
Became clear before, but bears repeating: If the U.S. spends what it spends today and what it gets is a hollow force, how much might it cost to get a Navy that actually could execute effectively at all levels -- and how much to one that could fight a technically capable foe?

@dude313123123 Prolly but the most exorbitant waste associated with the program is of time. The Navy had a shot to seriously recapitalize, which it squandered. Soon the US will be in an era in which it's devoting more $ to interest on its debt than it can appropriate to DoD
Nice thing for the Military-Industrial-Congressional Complex is a headline that says "DoD program falls short of goals, blows budget and schedule" is anti-news. It is what people *expect* to see. Coverage verrrrrrry seldom moves the needle w ppl outside the family
The saga, albeit familiar, would be comical if it didn't involve the squandering of such vast amounts of time, energy and treasure. The indulgence of a nation that could afford such frippery ... theoretically ... for a time

@JerryHendrixII @haynes_pd Without commenting on the merits either way my observation elsewhere was that this is the incumbent framework for the Navy &amp; powerful constituents, esp aerospace &amp; shipbuilding. So whatever replaces must not only be good, it must defeat the legacy infrastructure politically
@haynes_pd Sounds legit. Plus the nature of the conflict v different, obvs. USSR needed to sever a Lant logistics bridge to Eur that it did not need itself to support 8th Guards &amp; Warsaw Pact in the East v NATO. China defending its own homeland &amp; has had years to shape WestPac
@haynes_pd And even the sea lord of the Cold War navy, Adm. Rickover was asked (as memory serves) how long the ships would last if the balloon went up. If I recall he responded with a memorable quip such as, "three days."

... Syrians, Afghans and other groups and nations will feel quite differently, which is why Mattis and McGurk quit. Withdrawal means breaking faith with those allies and partners and they would not go along
... but what POTUS &amp; the WH are betting is that of all the things that might make a voter's choice in '20, low on or absent from the list will be foreign consequences in Syria and A'stan. And given the engagement by Americans w those conflicts, that is a safe bet.

Bush and Obama did not want the Fall of Saigon on their watch. Obama had it happen in Iraq and was apprehensive enough about it in A'stan that he scaled back the planned withdrawals as his term closed out. Not clear whether POTUS today thinks it won't happen or doesn't care

... as observed before, tho, if any president -- and certainly any R president -- was in a good position with core supporters to weather blowback from this not only in #ThisTown but whatever the med-term outcomes are in Syria, A'stan and elsewhere, this one is
SecDef, CJCS, CENTCOM &amp; others all made the case for Syria &amp; A'stan, per both their accounts and the president's, and the president not only acted against their advice but calls them schnooks for, as he said today 'not letting AQ and IS fight each other' in A'stan.
It's another way in which the world has changed. The Troops‚Ñ¢Ô∏è used to be untouchable and presidents since 9/11 sought the endorsement of -- and cover from -- The Generals or at least one big one. Recall Bush outsourcing the politics of the surge to Petraeus.
POTUS crossed an important threshold in the past ~4 weeks. He made clear again in great detail today at the WH that he not only considers himself smarter than DoD advisers and military commanders, but that he will overrule them and even belittle them

@cdrsalamander @cgberube Yes in its QDDG 1000 configuration, the ship can blend in seamlessly with, for example, all the vessels at anchor off Singapore or in the approaches to the Miraflores Lock
@cdrsalamander @cgberube This is why, as we used to say, it is so important for the CO of DDG 1000 to read the ROEs to all vessels over Channel 16 before the engagement. Coastal observers, "neutral" trawlers/AGIs etc must learn before the fact that they are not permitted to locate the ship visually
@cgberube Not fighting also might work well
... Adm Tomcat could come out today and renounce fixed wing naval aviation altogether and that would not mean anything for a decade, 15 years or more. There is no grand alternative teed up of any kind.
This isn't to say there couldn't be a vision of American seapower without them. But today there is none in officialdom and any alternative would not only have to be compelling but overcome the significant influence held by incumbents: shipbuilders, aerospace &amp; their advocates
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Big time. In a major conflict today many or most of the units that play could be disabled or lost w/ no replacement. That's a good reason to use them intelligently -- or be intelligent by not using them -- but they still have a lot of work short of war

@davelevinthal Good thought -- the Navy should replace each current CVN with a force of 75 smaller flat-decked warships, each of which can launch and then recover exactly one aircraft.
And if the answer is "smaller carriers," c'moooooooooooooon, maaaaaaaaaaaaan!
Anti-carrierists not only owe you a comprehensive alternative vision for how the Navy expresses seapower in a full-scale conflict. They owe you a description of how the nation will respond to all lesser conflicts and crises b/c most of the time it is not fighting WWIII
@cgberube @cdrsalamander Well it certainly has never been the case before in history that big warships were subject to damage or destruction by enemy action. That is clearly new in seapower, and it compels the U.S. Navy instead to field 10,000 PT-sized craft each equipped with a single TLAM or SM-6

Getting completely out of A'stan would require making the concomitant leap of faith that the terror-industrial complex built since 9/11 can disrupt major attacks without the added advantage of local operations against AQ and IS in A'stan -- a leap #ThisTown so far isn't making
The admin policy on A'stan suggests that even POTUS, who by his own admission wanted to cut bait entirely, isn't. A ~7k force, presumably, will continue to mow the law re terrorists even if the U.S. does less to prop up what we used to call the ANSF
üëá https://t.co/KC9ErtIMHl
There's a world in which POTUS makes a major address (say in Cincinnati) and says: 'It was a mistake to believe we could fight 'em over nurr so we didn't have to fight 'em hurr. Instead we'll have ... Grand New Strategy X ... or Fortress Murka ... or something.' Do we live in it?
If the war is a failure it is because its strategy was a failure and, accordingly, that raises questions about the strategy everywhere it is applied. Are you going to cut bait on A'stan but continue with operations in Somalia and Niger and Yemen and on and on?
But for a take that is partly so tough, this is pure fantasy. Why would Iran and Pakistan -- especially now -- agree to prevent al Qaeda or a successor from again using A'stan as a base for terrorism? Why would Russia -- especially now? https://t.co/S1II2EhFtg

Re POTUS-SAM #OPSEC today @Oriana0214 @TheDEWLine, now that the tale can be told, was anybody actually able to track Air Force One all the way to Al Asad? The trail seemed to go cold over Eastern Europe.
The truck park and in-processing and the base itself, from the obvious flightline to the less obvious Mother Of All Chow Halls, was an emblem of American power that was literally too big to take in.
One time I took off in a CH-46 from Al Asad to fly to Baghdad. I'll never forget passing over the vast depot in which all the materiel for the base -- plastic water bottles, food, everything you can imagine -- was in-processed from the fleets of semi trucks.
The president and first lady landed at Al Asad Air Base in Western Iraq -- a familiar hub to a lot of Marines and other troops (and correspondents) from back in the bad old days. A strategic location in the often restive and always inhospitable Anbar Province

... if that continues it means POTUS may have effectively established a new consensus by fiat. And if things go from bad to worse in Syria and A'stan, #ThisTown may object and criticize, but the game will have been changed nonetheless.
The question now isn't whether members of Congress agree -- many of them say they don't. The question is what action, if any, lawmakers are willing to take. Recent history shows how reluctant the Hill is to cast binding votes on these kinds of questions.
... the problem for SecDef (and maybe others) is doing so this abruptly requires breaking faith with the Afghans, the Kurds, the other Counter ISIS nations, NATO et al. POTUS' decision leaves them to their fates.
The theory was (as we remember) "fight 'em over there so we don't have to fight 'em over here." If Washington, explicitly or implicitly, concludes that hasn't worked or isn't worth continuing, can it build a Fortress America that shifts the burden homeward?
If in fact the U.S. continues on this course, it raises questions about the foundational strategic consensus inside Washington since 9/11 -- intervening in ungoverned spaces. If it ends in Syria and A'stan, why continue in Africa or anywhere else?

The test is also political. Why has the US stayed in A'stan so long? One reason is no president wanted a Fall of Saigon-like dissolution to take place on his watch. If that is what happens (as feared by the IC and others) how well is POTUS positioned to take the hit?
POTUS' orders on Syria and A'stan are a huge test. Members of Congress and the natsec establishment say US presence in both countries is essential, but how strongly will the Hill actually exert itself to preserve it? So far Congress has been loath to commit itself

USMC critics, per the piece, argue no big loss -- and, in fact, the Corps is a luxury, or the Corps as constructed today is ephemeral.		The Marines ......................................................................................................... would disagree.
2. Following behind point 1, if you start pulling the thread of the sweater that is the USMC, you can unravel the whole service. No CH-53K? Big hit to airlift -- esp of arty and vehicles -- at a time when that's more critical than ever w new LHAs. More effects ripple from there

The public messaging with DoD is often that increased inputs buy increased outputs, but that has never been so and isn't so now. You could spend billions more and get only a small addition to overall capacity because wholeness needs can suck up all the extra money
RT @andclev: Interesting, but unlikely to change behavior. 90 minutes of awkward questions from senators is a pretty small price to pay for‚Ä¶
Reporting by @DavidLarter this morning re 3 submarines that cannot dive reinforces the disconnect between a force that isn't whole today even with all the $ that DoD gets and the official dreams of expanding it with scores more ships.
Problematic. https://t.co/eCLhqGzZKs

@ZRKlein I hope you are right
@JerryHendrixII @ConsWahoo This point is critical. Other world powers can see all the same trend lines we can. They are reading our Tweets right now -- well at least yours and @ConsWahoo's. I hope you are wrong. But you could also argue this danger underscores the need for realism now, today
@ConsWahoo Fair. Fair fair fair. And you are correct that ultimately this is not about DoN. The services and OSD et al are children trying to deal with an alcoholic parent -- Congress.
@ZRKlein No it doesn't -- that's the point. That world is ending. In the new world the single biggest expenditure on the discretionary side -- bigger than DoD -- is interest on the debt. If and as interest rates rise accordingly the problem is compounded
@ConsWahoo Shrug emoji. Maybe Congress will raise taxes and bring the funds needed to underwrite this and the balance of the DoD medium-term program onstream. Then again maybe the services need to have a fallback vision for if that doesn't happen, rather than getting punched in the face
DoD and DoN are passengers in a car being driven by a drunk driver. On the one hand they're in peril over which they have no control -- but on the other hand they could at least put on their seat belts
On the one hand, sure, fine, go nuts -- why not make it a 400 ship "requirement" for all the practical chance it has at becoming reality? If this is just cotton candy, max it out, bruh. 		On the other hand, imagine a defense establishment that prepared today b/c winter is coming
DoD and DoN are going to hang tough and play pretend about a 355 ship "requirement" when they 	a. Can't maintain "wholeness" in the fleet they have today and	b. Likely will build-down from today's old force and	c. Likely won't get the plus-up needed to expand the fleet?

Saudi calculations that they could prevail upon the administration and that the flap would blow over were correct -- but what this makes clear is that the White House isn't just looking the other way until the headlines change. It and the president are foot-stomping the policy

It's a remarkable, perhaps even historic statement. He prevailed over the advisers to dictate most or all of it -- or prevailed upon them to craft it in what is unmistakably his style -- and the sentiments and policies it expresses are a sharp break with the past

The wider you open the aperture, tho, the clearer it becomes the notion of an apolitical spartan oasis in which The Brass and The Troops‚Ñ¢Ô∏è are safely isolated from the daily sh*tstorm is a myth. They were, are and will ever remain "political" just like everything else
@lauraapollo Maybe it preserves the mystique of The Troops‚Ñ¢Ô∏è that much longer but the ultimate peril becomes that much greater -- and McRaven and McChrystal and the others calculate they feel they don't want to abide the risk
So even if there really once was an apolitical oasis somehow apart from the everyday tumult from which an Adm McRaven could fire a shot while safely outraging his target, that is now gone. Getting one particle on you contaminates you as much as a full dunking
Ex-CJCS retired Adm Mullen warned about ex flag and general officers being out there, though. Even if they don't think they're politicizing what should ideally be a non-political military -- they are, he argued. And when you get even one crumb of Politics on you, you're fair game
This is not intended to be a disrespectful comparison but it's like when the District began to roll back its marijuana enforcement. All of a sudden all young people were openly smoking weed everywhere. And you're like, what the -- but then you remember the world changed
That's why these incidents are so weird -- it's still the early days in a new era that contravenes an old one that seemed too strong to ever change.
The Troops‚Ñ¢Ô∏è were off limits for so long and through so much sh*t that every reminder about how much the world has changed still feels jarring.

If everything is operating nominally and the CO wishes it, the ship can run at more than 40 knots. The forward portion of the vessel rides up off the surface like a personal watercraft and the stern digs in; the ship can spray up a huge rooster tail in the right conditions
Here's LCS 11 in the tranquil River Severn arriving at The Yard for its commissioning this weekend. Those big louvers above the bridge windows are what gulp the huge quantities of air the ship needs to run its main engines. https://t.co/CoupcRLsvP
... LCS 11 makes electricity with 4 Isotta Fraschini V1708 Common Rail Diesel Engines driving 4 Hitzinger generators for ~800 kW each, per Fincantieri. LCS is a fuel hungry hot rod with (if you've been counting) a total of six diesel engines + two gas turbines

MT30s &amp; diesels on LCS 11 are linked to machinery that means the turny-turny effects they yield physically move water to make the ship go. On HMS Queen Elizabeth, the engines are set up to generate electricity, which that ship can use as it wishes for systems v propulsion https://t.co/UurswlEiSi
@KToropin ... AF fought the Alaska delegation for years over relocating the 18th Aggressors -- and lost. And that was just a putative cost-saving move. Doing unit moves b/c of climate change worries would not go very well in Gridlockopolis
@KToropin No thinkification of this order will become public, if it takes place at all. One challenge is there is no way for the services to reorient their units on their own. The AF could not make major unit moves without it being public &amp; that means the Hill would get upset.
Rolls-Royce would like you to know the ship's main gas turbine engines are MT30s, yielding ~36 MW per copy. Powering the ship's four waterjets, LCS 11 can pump water at roughly 25,000 gallons per second. 		(When all the ship's systems are operating as designed.)
Fairbanks Morse would like you to know that the diesel engines powering LCS 11 -- to be commissioned this weekend in Annapolis -- are 16-cylinder Colt-Pielstick PA6B STCs and were built in Beloit, Wisconsin.

@DavidLarter @JasonKirell @pptsapper @LeoCruz1787 Then again, maybe the ChiComs' attack on such a strategic national resource would be what galvanized Americans to do their bit and pitch in -- volunteer, plant Victory Gardens and pay for the conflict with their own money instead of borrowing from capital markets
@DavidLarter @pptsapper @LeoCruz1787 Yes, cyber enables bad men to actually inflict hardship on Americans in a way they haven't experienced ... ever, potentially. Classical CW = that would harden their resolve. But it may actually compel capitulation, esp combined with heavy human losses overseas
@pptsapper @LeoCruz1787 @DavidLarter Big time -- tho this could be to the United States' detriment. If the PLA does a bunch of no-notice kinetic sh*t on Christmas Day 2026 and naval and air forces in the Pacific were degraded, they might calculate DC would just accept it -- and the United States might
@LeoCruz1787 @pptsapper @DavidLarter The United States would not try to replace it b/c the time and resources needed to build another would be in such intense demand to fight the conflict. This is what anti-carrierists always argue: the ships are too precious. They are. This is what makes the 21st century different
@pptsapper @LeoCruz1787 @DavidLarter What it arguably should compel is a realization at the highest level that our national capacities are extensive -- the greatest in the world -- but shallow and brittle, and that should inform geopolitical decisions. Goal should be NOT to fight WWIII
@KToropin @pptsapper @LeoCruz1787 @DavidLarter Or it's the Peace Dividend. Why don't we build ships quickly or in bulk? We can afford not to. There's a global market. Ford doesn't need to contemplate retooling a factory to build B-24s. The firms that do build them depend on federal welfare to endure, etc.
@pptsapper @LeoCruz1787 @DavidLarter But these days we can't regenerate capacity quickly. Tankers, auxiliaries, warships you have on the First Day of the War‚Ñ¢Ô∏è? They're all you have since you're not replacing em in the medium term. Bombers shot down? Etc

Can the Army execute FVL under these conditions? @JenJudson more qualified to address that than I but history teaches us that it is easier for a camel to pass thru the eye of a needle than for your United States Army to execute a big acquisition program, aviation or otherwise
Can USMC buy ACV under these conditions? It invented the we-have-no-choice gambit but it maybe tested to its limits in the medium term. The AAV was at the end of its life years ago.
... and that war may arguably have already been fought and won by Adm Bubblehead and the new Columbia-class SSBN, which DoN consensus has long viewed as non-negotiable. So the sound of the coming decade may be rounds pinging off SSBN and hitting other programs, killing them
The nice thing for the AF is it has a USMC-in-the-00s-like force of necessity driving its programs through the medium term. It can't *not* buy (at v least) F-35 and KC-46 b/c legacy platforms are already kaput. Navy, though? 355 was never happening. What next is a war within

Yes there's GPS, yes there's radar, yes there's all the things -- but these accidents are often the result of human error and/or breakdowns in human processes. You'll recall that not one but two of the most advanced U.S. Navy warships endured deadly, preventable accidents
Theories	1. The crew of the Helge Ingstad was asleep	2. The Helge Ingstad's midwatch did not react quickly enuf/could not get the ship underway quickly enuf b/c it was lying at anchor or engines were stopped to avoid the oil tanker
The track https://t.co/eeFoJV4Rav
But its crew obviously did not see the Helge Ingstad. And the frigate's crew either was not tracking that their onetime stationary contact had gotten underway and had established a course dangerous to their own ship -- or didn't quickly enuf.
The oil tanker appears to have just gotten underway per @JosephHDempsey's AIS track -- seems unlikely its crew would have been operating with the autopilot that early in the voyage, especially in those interior waters, right?

Nice thing for our purposes here is the Navy has given us an ... opportunity ... to see an LCS (this is the first one, Freedom) with a hole cut into its side so that one of its diesels could be replaced. Here's what they look like. https://t.co/NE0FWxFSxo
@spooknine Yep, and the vendor still sells it on "dual fuel" capability, because that makes the ship theoretically that much more versatile depending on the logistics situation. I don't know what the delta is between the two in terms of engine wear but that is a good GSM question
@ConsWahoo @richganske @ZRKlein I am just a humble scrivener -- it's up to the Sons of Mahan to decide how they must use their time and energy
True üëáGas turbines are aero-derived whirly-spinny tubes that sing a glorious High E above Middle C as they output turny-turny forces which the ship uses to spin its propeller. Marine diesels are scaled up truck or tractor engines with good old pistons that go wub-wub-wub-wub https://t.co/vYq2CYwa9x
Cruisers and destroyers have four big gas turbine engines and, altho they need a steady supply of dino juice, they have plenty of power to be able to keep pace with the carrier. So: Can you build a ship with (say) four diesels that can too? Evidently LockMart thinks it can
The long pole in the tent in terms of surface warship speed is the aircraft carrier. It has an atom furnace that burns magical rocks and it can go as fast as it wants for as long as it wants. Its escorts -- cruisers, destroyers, and, potentially, this new FFG(X) -- must keep  up
Interesting, cont'd: One notional design, per @DavidLarter, is a ship with combined diesel-and-diesel machinery. In other words, ship would have a set of diesels for poking along at 11 knots and a powerful set for higher speeds ... question is how fast could it go &amp; for how long
@richganske @ConsWahoo @ZRKlein "Whingeing" = Brit version of "whining." 	In this case, likely alludes to ppl focusing on sunk costs &amp; opportunities lost years ago when knee in DoD budget curve made possible big recapitalization, which, in the case of the failures, means that time &amp; money was squandered
Why that's interesting: LCS was the ship the fleet got stuck with, one that cannot achieve the vision that underpinned the initial concept. FFG(X) is the ship the fleet is actually thinking about before the fact -- imagine that -- and this epitomizes that analysis.
New thread to summarize where we are: LCS was designed to achieve 40 knots; the ships have gas turbines and main diesel engines driving big waterjets. But for new frigate, Lockheed looking at less powerful, more conventional propulsion, per @DavidLarter https://t.co/RhwnHkUK7n
@ZRKlein @ConsWahoo Yeah. I can imagine seapower advocates thinking about the time and money the Navy has thrown away on this and imagining what it could have had by now and that making those advocates sad
@ZRKlein @ConsWahoo Well the *theoretical* merit is huge. The ships were never meant to fight the Chinese. they're meant to do everything else while the fleet is. But they can't actually do anything, even just babysit minor flare-ups.
@ConsWahoo Great brief, Navy (so far) cannot execute. Module gear don't work. Ships not reliable. Hulls not in quantities to make practicable. Other reason was quick-swap. LCS 7 has to go fight pirates. It chops them up. Then Iran mines the Strait. LCS zips back to Bahrain, onloads MCM
@DzirhanDefence @ConsWahoo That was one concept. Also, Bob Work also wanted to use the high speed to enable regionally dispersed units to converge and mass in response to a crisis -- e.g. a whole bunch sailing from from Singapore &amp; Japan and you quickly have, y'know, 10 ships in place
Is there a CODAD configuration today that would make this ship fast enough to run with the strike group?

Safe routine flight operations are the product of hours of experience with as many variables as possible accounted for, so the Brits are working through a check-sheet that prolly includes as many of these types of scenarios as possible with these aeroplanes
Why, I hear you asking, do these ostensibly low-observable aircraft have external weapons fitted, shouldn't they carry internally, etc. 		1: Because "bomb truck" configuration enables larger payloads for hops when stealth isn't critical	2: Brits want to test everything, incl that
U.S. Navy aviation ordnancemen from CVN 69 helped supervise Jack and Jane Tar as they assembled and loaded the bombs, the Royal Navy says. As red-shirted sailors have said since the days of Nelson, "If you ain't ordnance, you ain't sh*te, m'lord."

More here about how Their Lordships envisage recoveries -- Leftennant J. Tar flies his F-35B straight in over the stern, gets his jet down as it's moving and rolls the gear onto the flight deck and *then* stops. https://t.co/CyZ6r3MmPa
One of the USMC-style recoveries from before the first rolling landing. The jet approaches over the water along the port side and holds parallel with a parking spot. Then the pilot powers right over the flight deck and descends vertically to land. #FlightTestTuesday https://t.co/nnOmEO6yqT
Let's have a few more looks at F-35B flight ops aboard @HMSQnlz on this #FlightTestTuesday. Here, for example, is a rare look at one of the big cost drivers for this pricey programme -- the aircraft's use, as fuel, of liquefied natural rainbows https://t.co/Q7wsOHH5DI

@FormerDirtDart Good point, good point -- so long as the fighting spirit of America's airmen remains strong, the physical condition of their aircraft is immaterial
Why is that pertinent? Because people are freaking the f*ck out about whether or not the world's most premier air superiority fighter force was decimated. And not saying anything -- Gen Thunderchief's preferred method of public affairs -- is not calming them down.
So the squadron has to go through and inspect these a/c to assess the impact of the storm? Roger that, got it. But how many aeroplanes are we talking about? AF could answer that. How many are there relative to those that go away? AF could answer that too.
@mcjwalsh @cdrsalamander Nobody knows -- at this point, apparently, including the AF. CSAF says they've got to do a comprehensive inspection. Which is what it is ... the problem is, nobody even has said for certain how many aircraft were down there in the first place. That they *can* answer
Another thing that has become clear through this whole ordeal is why your United States Air Force public affairs enjoys the reputation that it has. Vacuum of information and the withholding of important facts = speculation &amp; catastrophizing fills the gap
