#Secdef: cyber a whole-of-gov't effort. I believe strongly we need to work with law enforcement, Intel community, DHS &amp; private sector.
#Secdef: we are tying to support a strong, multi-sectarian Iraq. That is our objective &amp; our hope -- the fastest route to defeat of ISIL.
#Secdef: if sequester continues, do not believe we can keep making incremental cuts while maintaining same objectives of defense strategy.
#SecDef to HAC-D: sequester was not result of objective factors. Its purpose was to compel prudent compromise, compromise that never came.
SecDef: we don't just seek defeat of #ISIL. We seek lasting defeat of ISIL.
SecDef: Our advise/assist mission reflects the view that a multi-sectarian approach is best to Iraq's defense. (2/2)
SecDef: share concerns about sectarian tensions looming in #Iraq. (cont. 1/2)
SecDef: three important challenges we face,represented by resources we are asking for: ISIL, European Reassurance Initiative and Afghanistan
SecDef: Assad needs to see the doom he has set his country on, and get more pressure from Russia and Iran.
SecDef: we will conduct an offensive against Mosul when the Iraqi's can lead it and when it can succeed.
SecDef: we are seeing ISIL try to expand in North Africa,Gulf region, and Afghan. ISIL is attractive to younger members of older movements.
SecDef: Asia-Pacific rebalance a critical part of our strategy going forward.
SecDef: risk in readiness will increase under sequestration.
SecDef: Pres. Ghani a partner we have been looking for and without whom...we can't be successful. Committed to making progress stick in Afg.

#SecDef #Hagel has ordered reviews of physical security at @DeptofDefense locations worldwide &amp; of security clearance policies &amp; practices.
#SecDef #Hagel and Joint Chiefs Chairman General @Martin_Dempsey to brief reporters today at 11:15 AM ET in the Pentagon Briefing Room.

#SecDef: @DeptofDefense will continue to offer its full assistance in the investigation of this terrible and senseless violence. #NavyYard
#SecDef has ordered Pentagon flags to be lowered to half-staff to remember and honor those lost and injured at #NavyYard.
Not out of a specific threat, but as a prudent and precautionary step, we have increased our security posture at the Pentagon.

Understandable desire for information on tragic events at Navy Yard. Need to let law enforcement officials determine precise facts.

@londonoe I believe that reporters should acknowledge opinion pieces. Certainly looks like endorsement, even if there are @twitter caveats.
@londonoe This is an anonymously sourced opinion piece about opinions. Fact: our military planners are most professional in the world.
On #Syria, clear parameters for military action: objective is deter &amp; degrade CW use, limited scope, limited duration, no boots on ground.

When US troops deployed to Kandahar &amp; Helmand &amp; Japan &amp; S Korea are worried about sequestration, there's a big problem here in Washington.
#SecDef: sequestration would jeopardize military readiness, America's standing in the world.  Fiscal cliff = defense disaster.
@wromradio you too!
On Iran, Sen. Hagel testifies that he supports the President's policy of prevention, not a policy of containment.
Chuck Hagel would be first enlisted service member to serve as Secretary of Defense. He'll connect with our troops at time of war.
Sen. Sam Nunn: Chuck Hagel has been a successful executive in government and business. #leadership
Let's be clear. Sen Hagel believes in strong American leadership, strong Iran sanctions, a strong military, and strong alliance with Israel.
#SecDef Panetta believes Chuck Hagel will be an outstanding #SecDef and has called for his swift confirmation by the United States Senate.
@buzzfeed on Prof. Chuck Hagel, quoting his Georgetown TA: he "just has a fierce fire in his belly about doing the right thing for America."
Today is 45th anniv of start of Tet Offensive. Tomorrow Chuck Hagel-who fought in that campaign as infantryman-testifies as SecDef nominee.
If we go off fiscal cliff, DoD civilian employees could face furloughs. 86% of DoD civilians live outside DC. Congress needs to act now.

@FareedZakaria To your question, Chuck Hagel is indeed the right person to become the 24th SecDef. #SecDef Panetta strongly supports him.
Let's be clear about Senator Hagel's views on Iran: he strongly supports sanctions and believes that no options are off the table.
I agree with @RichardHaass, who said on #thisweekABC that personal, ad hominem attacks have no place in confirmation process for nominees.
For nuke watchers: Chuck Hagel has always believed that as long as nuclear threats exist, we must maintain strong and ready nuclear arsenal.
