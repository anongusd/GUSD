@ChrisMurphyCT Conn. Had what 3.5 million people. As opposed to Florida with over 20 mil. Come on now why don't you show some now skewed facts and figures. 		7 times the population with only 3 times the deaths. Maybe conn isn't so safe.... Safety in numbers, lower chances...
@DebbieRexroat So you lied to her and forgot all the good he has done for our country
@mc_hotm @TeamPelosi vote to make false accusations A felony!!
@timothywmurray @TeamPelosi I think you have it wrong... The left is the one who is trying to deny the results. They lost the general election and now was to abolish the electoral college... Talk about not accepting the results. The left hates everything if they don't get their way
Where is a help to explain the modes and functions of certain features. Sky net mode for instance?? @LynxKik
@HillaryClinton Considering how badly you failed being sec of state and what a shit show your "negotiation" was... You would be that last person I'd ask for advice. I hope they hang you for your crimes. Cunt
@SIA_satellite @TinaPelkeyFCC @FCC @AjitPaiFCC Great pic... Looks like @AjitPaiFCC 's face  is still stuck after blowing every telecom. https://t.co/UUQa2oUJdg
@JerryBrownGov @RepCardenas @realDonaldTrump Also the highest gang population, the highest poverty rate and the highest number of sec offenders... Great job
@TeamPelosi Nancy, what world are you living in... Are you on constant hallucinogens. You have zero credibility and your fake actions speak louder than words. Please do Americans a favor and resign. Or better yet claim "claim to have evidence that will lead to Hillary's arrest "..
@matthewberryfcc Is that why you gutted customer protections.. Name one telecom that was hurt by net neutrality financially... And show me. Which ones paid you all screw the American people... We all know that each of y'all deep down Knew you were wrong but only saw dollar signs.
@FBI Hillary should get double that.. And you all let her walk free..
@HillaryClinton During the last week  we almost lost Kevin Smith who is a great film maker. He had a heart attack... And almost bit the big one. I wish it was you instead...and that you don't survive.
@chrishorrocks72 @realDonaldTrump Just once... So all the other radical islam attacks were just accidents. You have your own strain ofRadical islam growing in your country and your govt is dragging its feet hunting them down becuase they are too afraid to offend the 25k (roughly) extremist in your country.
@FBI So. 		 Every politician right.. Becuase they don't vent hide it anymore.
@BrendanCarrFCC Roadblocks... Oh you mean cutting the Internet up and paving the way for paid prioritization of our Internet so telecoms can picket even more money... You are corporate shill. You and ajit need to be hung for curruption.
@matthewberryfcc You sold out the American people... Net neutrality was there to protect people... At some point I hope your curruption is brought to bare in court and you spend your life in jail... With no WiFi
@chrishorrocks72 @realDonaldTrump Keep talking shit from across the ocean, your country keeps hiding its growing Muslim problems. You literally have Muslims killing soldiers in the streets in broad daylight. You better start learning the Quran and get a jump start before it becomes mandatory @Leerigby123.
@SenMarkey Wouldn't need union's if the US stepped up and forced companies to pay living wages and create standard working conditions. 40 hour weeks, bottom up profit sharing (ceo can only make x% of lowest employee)...  Look at Amazon. Bezos is a billionaire, 99% of his employees struggle
@BrendanCarrFCC @NTCAconnect I hope you are indicted on corruption. You know that repealing net neutrality was wrong. You know that the people opposed it. #NetNeutrality #corruption #NetNeutralityIsFreeSpeech
Chandler please sing Carl poppa for us before you go. @AMCTalkingDead
How about instead of banning guns nationwide. how about we try it out in one urban city and see how it goes. Let's try Chicago... Let's see what happens when we ban guns in Chicago.... Oh wait.. 		#2A #RightsToBearArms #againsttyranny #DefendtheSecond #2ndAmmendment
People calling for the ban on AR platform rifles becuase they are designed to kill humans.. The second ammendment wasn't designed for hunting. It was for defending your rights agianst a tyrannical govt. #NRA #NRABoycott #ComeAndTakeIt #2A #DefendtheSecond
@SenFeinstein The second ammendment is not for us to hunt but to defend our Freedom from tyrannical governments... A short history lesson could teach you this. In which case a gun designed to kill people would be the best option....
@KeeganAllen @WhiteHouse We should also ban sugar... And fat... Cars... Water. All have higher kill counts than guns.
@davidhogg111 Paid shill and crisis actor? You are an aspiring reporter... What better way than to get in front of every camera you can find. Skeptical.....
Still here, see told you I wasn't a Russian bot.. #maga #Russians #RussianBots #AmericanMade
@alt_lawyer @RepMaxineWaters @Alt_moms Money in the bank isn't the same as net worth... Y'all need to learn the difference. Oprah's net worth largely stems from. Her network and TV show. Trumps comes from his real estate and investment business... They could both only have 10$ in the bank and still have a billion net
@CNN Using kids ands coaching them... That's pretty low @CNNPolitics. The @FBI dropped the ball to a Credible threat. The shooter met the lethal force triangle long before her entered the school, capability, opportunity and ability. Y'all should be ashamed of yourselves.
@MWV731 @caseybudge @josephfulginiti @ladiharli @dyoukilis Actually the FBI can flag you in their database. It's been done before. There was a news story a few years ago where they showed that the FBI can flag individuals and stop them from. Legally buying guns.
OMG the #RussianIndictments I can't believe Russia would do such a thing... I mean a thing like post memes and stuff online... The US would never do such a thing 		Oh wait... 		#wereallguilty #doasisaynotasido #MAGA #MuellerIndictments #RussianCollusion https://t.co/gFcfa13JQ0
Americans were involved in numerous covert regime change. During the Cold War, the U.S. government supported coups that overthrew democratically elected governments in Syria in 1949, Iran in 1953,Guatemala in 1954, the Congo Crisis of 1960,Brazil in 1964 and Chile in 1973.
People need to learn and understand the definition of #Indictments no one has been convicted.
@sandylindblom @tedlieu It has nothing to do with the weapons... The priblem is we are raising an entire generation of special needs kids who can't take criticism, cant defend themselves, and nothing is their fault.... The pussification of our children by telling them they can't fight back when bullied
@SBCCoalition @Pedroconsafos Every democrat who opposes the Wall... Lives in a gated community surrounded by wall... Hypocrites
@CBSNews Guns aren't the problem, it's this Victimhood mentality we're are raising our https://t.co/WexCDNzCqu's not your fault. We are raising a generation of cowards. Schools shootings went on the rise when schools took a stance on bullying. Teach kids to have a backbone, not a gun
#ParklandSchoolShooting #stonemanshooting #NikolasCruz https://t.co/OCzkFmxtDg
Guns in the usa aren't the problem, guns have been here as long as we have been a country. problem is victimhood mentality in our children. It's someone else's fault not my own. We used to tell our kids to stand up for themselves in the face of bullying... Now we create cowards.
@GaryBlackal @johncardillo You could use it as a loop hole for HOA with strict property guidelines... It's art and art is protected..
I guess owners rights mean nothing becuase vandals are artist now. I hope this is appealed and the owner files charges against every artist. Graffiti isn't special, unless you have permission it's not a protected form of art. 		https://t.co/Flm34dhAWj
@WhipHoyer Voter ID.... IT'S NOT RACIST. Bar coded picture ID that is checked agianst a  national database at the time of voting.. Face don't match the picture in the database and information don't match the ID... Not allowed to vote.
@jamiefid Jesus, is there anything people don't complain about these days... It's a movie about animals that talk. Keep PC politics outta ours kids lives.
Watch out, fake news activist are pushing conspiracy theories that Steele dossier related and uranium 1 people were killed on the Russian plane crash.... It's already been debunked. Don't fall for their idiotic madness. #fakenews #FakeNewsCNN #SteeleDossier #Uranium1 #UraniumOne
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, deport that man and you never have to feed him again.		#MAGA #BuildThatWall #AmericansAreDreamersToo #AmericaFirst
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump It's like none of you have heard of filibusters... Are you all stupid. It's a cop-out move when you know you are losing....
@Zenblurbs @BrianHartFCC @AjitPaiFCC @FCC How come @AjitPaiFCC forgot to protect the american consumer when he gutted net neutrality... He isn't anything except a talking cock sock for Verizon...
@AshleySteel That's why I follow porn stars... Sunsets get boring after a while. But tits and ass never do.
@imodyehab @MLifaro @buchanan_br Several books with contradicting ideology that results in murder, genocide, racial hate, sexism. Gave humans Brains, along with cancer, cerebral palsy And whatever the 50+ fatal fetal conditions a child can be born with 	For everything good thing god does there 1000 wrong things
@buchanan_br @MLifaro I am super chill, I have no reason to be riled up over a tweet. And if you are worthless it's because of your personal choices... Not because of a god or your circumstances..
@g_ritze @SenSchumer @POTUS Daca dreamers need to just man up and accept their place in life... They came here illegally. Why can't they respect the laws of a country. Imagine if I broke into your house and then demanded to stay there...
@Burmeiste1Laura @SenSchumer @POTUS Where did you get your bogus numbers... 90% of who... I don't know a single person who is for daca.
@buchanan_br @MLifaro Are you seriously that delusional. There is no anti christ.. There wasn't even a christ. Just a man wrapped in folklore. Zero factual evidence supports his claim, in fact most of his feats were ideas stolen from other cultures (Virgin birth, martry, came back from the dead)
@buchanan_br @MLifaro god, specifically your God has had zero input... And most if not all biblical stories have been debunked with just common sense. Have you notice with the rise of technology and the ability to capture moments on film. Miracles and stuperstition have kinda fallen off...
One of the smartest atheist on the planet just sent his car to Mars. On the most powerful rocket ever built. In the glove box, hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy and a towel. The last time religion flew something the US lost 2 towers.		#atheist #ElonMusk #SpaceX #HeavyFalcon #tesla
@Tracydwyer7 @TeamPelosi You are also quite dumb... You obviously need to learn some reading comprehension. Nowhere did he say a teacher, it said secretary. Dumb dumb Democrats. #dimdem #HillaryForPrison #MAGA #billclintonwaspaidbytherussians
@BenjaminJS @realDonaldTrump If Hillary wasn't so well Connected she would have been behind bars... The server and the destruction of evidence/govt property were enough... But she walks free. Dem's just can't take an L without being sore...
@B_L_Mencken @realDonaldTrump He then would have won out of default. @HillaryClinton should have bee  arrested... Ask any service member what would have happened to them if they perpetrated the same crime... Orange suits, silver bracelets and military prison.... She got away becuase money and connections
@Haikatrine @RepJerryNadler @HouseJudDems @HouseGOP @CIA We had evidence @HillaryClinton mishandled classified information then destroyed evidence,and  refused to testify under oath. If anyone was colluding with the Russians it was the Clinton's   considering Bill took a 500k speech fee from a bank that is run by the Kremlin. Uranium 1
@RepBonamici @RepBonamici oh now your party is worried about leaking classified material.  Where was your outrage when your candidate @HillaryClinton was storing classified emails in an unsecured location. Then destroyed the evidence. she was the biggest threat to national security #dimdems
Nothing to say regarding your implicit spying on an American citizen. Funny how the person you endorsed for presidency was the person who paid for the dossier used in the fisa warrant @BarackObama
@RepBonamici That's it... You tweet about heart problems when clear evidence was just released  that your party tried to use govt resources and foreign agents to spy on an American citizen. #HillaryForPrison #dimdem #MAGA
@riotgrrlriot @TeamPelosi @WomenG4Hillary @DevinNunes @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @HouseGOP 18 U.S. Code § 798		Well Hillary technically can never run for office. She admitted to storing classified data on an unsecured server... And then willfully destroying the evidence. She would be serving time if she wasn't so corrupt and well connected.... Ask any service member.
The @ClintonFdn paid a foreign spy to create a dossier on @realDonaldTrump and gave it to the @FBI so they could obtain a #FISA warrant to spy on an American citizen, there's your collusion.. @HillaryClinton... The most corrupt Democrat to ever live.
@RezIndianFDL @SenWarren Every seen a firework show.... How about an airshow, car show, shot show.
@NBCNews Must be a liberal, I bet he is vegan, does crossfire and voted for Hillary....
@RonWyden you are worried about the @NRA getting money from. Russia but failed over and over to mention the Clinton's received money from Russian banks with ties to the #Kremlin. I guess the uranium one scandal doesn't mean anything... 500k is just #Crumbs right.
@RonWyden @RonWyden the president can use #FISA to spy on its own citizens And #Democrats don't want the #Memo released becuase it shows that the #FBI and the previous president @BarackObama using it. Does that mean @BarackObama lied when he said @realDonaldTrump wasn't being investigated.
@LattesAndRain @SenSchumer Oh you mean like the Democrats have been bungling their own corruption. I mean it's not like the DNC screwed one of its own members out of a presidential slot, or mishandled classified information, or destroyed evidence, or refused to testify under oath, or sold uranium to iran
@timkaine @timkaine yes totally forgot that being a party member means that you swear an oath of fealty... You aren't allowed to make your own decisions. Idiot ... You can be a (R) and not want trump to be @POTUS
@JeffAlerman @GinoJoseman @NBCNews Don't waste your time trying to look smarter... You make yourself out to look like an idiot.... All that means is I didn't care to create a crafty cool name. Just one to make my voice heard.
#ReleaseTheDamnMemo democrats are on fire tonight losing their collective minds. #NancyPelosi #andersoncooper tomorrow we will see as a country what your party is so scared of. I hope we finally get to see people in handcuffs.
@CNN @andersoncooper @andersoncooper when are you going to stop protecting you friends with piss poor journalism. Read the facts not your opinions. The DNC corrupted their own party, threw sanders under the bus. They got behind a criminal who knowingly broke a law (18 U.S. Code § 798).
@GinoJoseman @NBCNews Only a Hillary supporter would be this stupid to think the globe is flat... Or does calling it a globe offend one your 62 genders..
@SenWarren How about we take funding out of sports, art and music... Less than 1% of people in those hs programs ever make into that field professionally ( 12k athletes as per the BLS). Less high school stadiums more shop classes.
@NancyPelosi @DevinNunes @SpeakerRyan @NancyPelosi @TeamPelosi you are so upset but I don't remember seeing your outrage when @HillaryClinton lied to the FBI then destroyed evidence to cover her ass. Ask yourself, if a military service member set up a classified server in his house... Which jail would he be in
@JoyAnnReid @JoyAnnReid nice to see you post about the cable ratings, but myself and many millions of Americans watched the #SOTU via stream.... Your cherry picked numbers are way off.
@JoelOsteen @JoelOsteen  you are a fraud. A real man of God would donate everything you own to enriching the loves of those around you. Take an oath of poverty. Live richly in God like real priest. Jesus said, Peter upon you I will build my church. Greed is a mortal sin.
The amount of Democrats running for the hills and retiring makes you wonder what they are talking about behind closed doors. Fear, financial safety, job security.....
@SenRonJohnson @POTUS @SenRonJohnson the problem isn't our insurance... The problem is our medical systems exorbitant price gouging, Lack of upfront pricing, and disregard for human health over long term cost over care (treat not cure) mentality.
@TeamPelosi Are you really begging for donations after you publicly snubbed honest born Americans, veterans, victims of gang violence live on TV. Are you seriously that stupid? How about you sell your house and use that as a campaign donation.
The right- let's make America the great strong country it used to be... 		The left- we hate trump, so we will do everything to hurt his presidency, including destroying the country.. Yolo
