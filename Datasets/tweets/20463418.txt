Some people argue that there's no need to pre-register 16- and 17-year-olds. @BrittBee_13 disagrees, noting that young people are leading political movements. "Young people are at the forefront in these battlegrounds like climate change and reproductive justice," she says.
Danielle Root, Voting Rights Manager at @amprog says that "in California, there were 2.3 million people that were registered or had their information updated through that state's AVR program." Read our report: https://t.co/TeJVEuIFZR

"Right now it's important to reach out to your Member of Congress," says @ChelseaCParsons. "Continue to make the point that gun violence prevention is an issue for voters."
The bill also addresses domestic violence. "One of the areas that this background checks bill would have a significant impact is on domestic abusers, to make sure they don't have access to guns," says @ChelseaCParsons
H.R. 8 would close one of the most glaring loopholes in gun laws. @ChelseaCParsons says the bill "would require a background check for all gun sales regardless of whether you're buying a gun at a gun store, or whether you're buying a gun from your neighbor."
Instead of focusing solely on gun safety measures, @dantbarry says the gun violence prevention movement should reframe how it looks at the issue of safety. "Just by having some sort of power for communities that allows for accountability. Like a community review board."
"The tradition of solutions around gun violence has been around crime," says @dantbarry. Instead, he says, we should "create a public safety network."
"People were experienced poverty, people were experiencing violence," says @dantbarry of his upbringing, highlighting that issues of gun violence are deeply rooted in the disinvestment of communities.

"We're getting hit from all sides now," says @ProgressMich's @saminglot. "There's no issue that Michigan isn't being hit on by lame-duck politics."
These political shenanigans from the Michigan legislature are based on fear says @saminglot: "They're scared for the future. That's why we are seeing bills to even change the ballot amendment process."

On the Wisconsin legislature's power grab, @analieseeicher says: "People are upset. We are Midwest nice, but people are upset because that's not what they voted for."
Voters spoke loud and clear in 2018, but undemocratic moves stunted change. "Gerrymandering was key to the Republicans keeping control of the Wisconsin legislature," says @analieseeicher
The majority in the Michigan legislature is ramming a slew of bills to curtail the power of incoming leaders. "They're trying to limit the power of folks like the Secretary of State and take campaign oversight away from her," says @saminglot
Live from Wisconsin and Michigan: We are joined by @analieseeicher from @onewisconsinnow, @saminglot from @ProgressMich, and Denzel McCampbell from @EngageMichigan to talk about power grabs from their state legislatures ahead of incoming progressive governors.
To join the fight against Ohio's Stand Your Ground law, visit https://t.co/kMeLh7GqRY

Lawmakers in Ohio are trying to push through a dangerous and controversial stand your ground bill. "The bill in Ohio we call the Kill at Will Bill," says @ImSoCoy

Our friends from @CivicYouth have been tracking youth voter numbers this cycle. @abbyik notes that early data shows that "18, 19, and 20-year-olds were extremely engaged in this election."
Even with barriers to voting, the youth vote increased in key races across the country. @huffyrach says we must still keep an eye on voter suppression. "Voting laws are so important when we talk about voter turn out."
Montana had a razor-thin Senate election where young people had a sizable impact. @huffyrach says: "We knew that by November 4th, just by turning absentee ballots, young people had increased their vote share by 15%."

There are many policies that would help eliminate voting barriers and increase participation. One of them registering online. "Online voter registration increases the convenience of registering to vote," says Danielle Root.
In addition to state legislatures passing restrictive voting laws, local governments are also moving to restrict voting rights. "We see all around the country polls closing primarily in black and brown communities," says @Connor__Maxwell
"The issue that keeps me up at night is voter ID. I don't think it gets enough attention," says @Connor__Maxwell. "After [Heidi Heitkamp] was elected, the legislature didn't even blink to pass a strict voter ID law."
If you have issues on Election Day with exercising your right to vote, please call 1-866-OUR-VOTE. Experts will be ready to help you exercise your right!
Danielle Root on FL Gov. Rick Scott "What we do know is that the number of voter registration spikes closer to [the deadline.] The fact that the state voter registration system has not been functioning... the governor is essentially disenfranchising thousands of eligible voters."

"It's cruel. It's exclusionary. They are giving these folks until the end of the year to get married‚Äî or get kicked out." @Shugruberg from @LGBTProgress on the Trump administration's end to visas granted to unmarried same-sex partners of diplomats.
For the past nine years, a state department policy allowed same-sex partners of diplomats to get the same benefits that we afford heterosexual partners. This week, the Trump administration and the @StateDept under @SecPompeo ended that policy.
We are now joined by @Shugruberg from @LGBTProgress to talk about Trump's administration denying visas to spouses of LGBT diplomats.
Eric Blankenstein blamed his racist comments on his youth. He was 25 years old. Linda Jun correctly points out, "actions that we take in that period of our lives have consequences."
Linda Jun from @RealBankReform joins us. She says that the racist comments from a @CFPB official from the fair lending office show that Mick Mulvaney is undermining the work of the agency.

Russia's influence in our elections has not ended. @jdlamond says "we see senate campaigns being hacked, disinformation campaigns on social media, and its not just Russia, there's other countries involved too."
Some people are making the case that the Manafort trial has nothing to do with Russia collusion, but "[Manafort] was the highest-ranking official in the campaign, other than the candidate," says @jdlamond
Back in April we were joined by @jdlamond to talk Trump and Russia. Since, there's been an avalanche of news and indictments. The Managing Director of @moscow_project is here to give us an update.

Thank you @cdkang76 and @citizenwillis for joining us on @LeslieMarshall to chat SCOTUS and culture of corruption! https://t.co/ZgwnZ8XWBl
It's hard to keep up with all the scandals going in Washington. If only there was a wiki page to learn about what's going. Oh wait, there is. To keep track of all of Trump's scandals check out https://t.co/KNgqdSVXQT
With midterm elections less than two month away, @citizenwillis says corruption will play a big role come Election Day. "A recent poll showed that corruption is the top issue for independents," he says.
There is a culture of corruption that surrounds the White House. "We've seen the NYT op-ed, we've seen Omarosa, and we've seen Woodward's book and they're all consistent," says @citizenwillis
To track where your senators stand on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination visit https://t.co/wFKI3Bt4DO
If Kavanaugh reaches the Supreme Court, he may see a case involving President Trump's presidential powers. @cdkang76 says Kavanaugh "has one of the most extreme records on views of presidential powers."
When @cdkang76 worked on Elena Kagan's Supreme Court confirmation, his team provided 99% of her records during her time at the White House. What's going on now? We've only seen a small fraction of Kavanaugh's record.
If Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court, he'll have power over our lives for decades to come. But the Senate regularly votes on lifetime appointments. "It's important to focus on all the courts, not just the Supreme Court like we see these days," says @cdkang76

Thank you for tuning in to this week‚Äôs show! And a big thank you to @TylerCullis and Trevor Sutton for joining us to talk sanctions and foreign policy! https://t.co/uqJjFLa0CU
Trevor worries about the future of our foreign policy. "We have a president who is openly admiring authoritarian leaders and has, rhetorically, flipped the bird at our long-stranding democratic allies," he says. "It's authoritarian envy."
The US has a role in promoting democracy, says Trevor. But people have a right to doubt America's role abroad with our long history of war. "People associate the term 'promoting democracy' with invasions, with toppling governments."
How does one define a progressive foreign policy? It's a conversation that the left will always have, says Trevor. "To understand what being progressive on foreign policy means-- it's a conversation that will continue to happen."
We're now joined in studio by Trevor Sutton, a Fellow with @amprog's National Security and International Policy to talk about a new report on American foreign policy.
While sanctions have been used by past administrations, the current administration has imposed country-wide embargoes where goals are not clear. "Its impossible for Iran to change it's behavior, to change its soul, and get these policies lifted," says @TylerCullis
The effects on the Iranian sanctions are vast, with real impacts on people. @TylerCullis explains, "if you have an Iranian grandparent who came here with you, pass away, and want to be buried in Iran, there's actually a regulation because they have to be exported back to Iran."
Sanctions are a major part of our current foreign policy, but what and who does it affect? Just about everything and everyone. "Diapers are totally unavailable in cities like Tehran," says @TylerCullis
Welcome to the #MillennialTakeover of the @LeslieMarshall show! First up we talk sanctions with @TylerCullis. Later we'll be joined by Trevor Sutton, National Security and International Policy Fellow at @amprog to talk US foreign policy. FOLLOW LIVE: https://t.co/krTQ5Ot6FF

In the White House, Kavanaugh served as staff secretary: meaning every document that went across the president‚Äôs desk went across his first. NO JOKE: this includes legislation and statements on limiting abortion, torturing detainees, and marriage quality: https://t.co/JG3umzDanK https://t.co/DsVDuzrAYE
üö®RIGHT NOWüö®: @senjudiciary has officially begun confirmation hearings for Trump‚Äôs Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. ICYMI, Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals and previously worked in the White House under George W. Bush. #SaveSCOTUS [THREAD]

That‚Äôs a wrap for the #MillennialTakeover of the @LeslieMarshall Show! Thank you @reyjunco and @MiFamiliaVota for joining us to talk youth vote! https://t.co/NQsvaMs6Rd
.@MiFamiliaVota engages young people in many ways, including a youth development program. Karina Martinez, Communications Director says, "our youth are able and capable. They're also hungry to get involved. They just need the support."
Nancy says that with President Trump attacking the Latinx community, Latinx people are coming out to make their voices heard.
There is no doubt that young people are engaged in politics this year. Nancy Batista, Florida State Director for @MiFamiliaVota says, "recently we've seen an increase with the youth. It started with the students-- the students that were engaged from the Parkland shooting."
We are now joined by Karina and Nancy, staff members of @MiFamiliaVota to talk about yesterday's primaries in Florida, and how they're working to turn out young people and people of color for the midterms!
As part of their research on Millennials, @CivicYouth compiled data on voting patterns and identified five clusters of voters: Activist Egalitarians, Participatory Libertarians, Disempowered Egalitarians, Alienated Libertarians, The Lost and Disengaged.
We know that young people are going to have a substantial influence in the midterm elections. But @reyjunco along with @CivicYouth has compiled a handy tool where young people are going to have a major impact. You can check that out here: https://t.co/MAZhtW3HCv

We could go on and on, but one thing remains true: the President of the United States does not care about young people. If he did, he wouldn't be helping shady student loan companies, enacting tax breaks for the mega-rich, or gutting our healthcare. Try again, @realDonaldTrump.
Home ownership for young people is also abysmal. In 2004, households headed by people under the age of 35 stood at 43.1 percent. Today, that number is approximately 35 percent. https://t.co/1CLZfLVSyf
Unemployment rates offer an incomplete economic picture. By analyzing the labor force participation rate, the percentage of people looking for work, we find that young people are still recovering from the recession. In June, the LFPR was at 55.4 percent. https://t.co/0yqLFIuQnV
And while students and borrowers are saddled with $1.5 trillion dollar in student loan debt, the Trump-DeVos Department of Education is working to make it easier for shady colleges to take advantage of them. https://t.co/UMpB7QT3hA
On average, young people today are expected to earn the same or less than their parents did at the same age, even with higher levels of education and productivity. https://t.co/kj91QdL4Ql

John Russell is a 28-year-old farmer who recently ran in the special election in Ohio's 12th district. He's been involved in climate change activism since he was a kid. Now, he advocates for renewable energy technologies that have the potential to reinvigorate local economies.

Thank you  @BrittanyA___ for joining us for the #MillennialTakeover of the @LeslieMarshall show to talk tipped wages, initiative 77, and #OneFairWage! https://t.co/OQp7r8sGTv
You can learn more about the #OneFairWage campaign, @BrittanyA___ and @DCFPI at https://t.co/1uF5TBSwjL
The #OneFairWage campaign's goal is to create a system that works for workers. "The current system puts a lot of responsibility on the worker to get the wages that they deserve. There's a lot of cases of wage theft," says @BrittanyA___
Trump's SCOTUS pick Brett Kavanaugh will prioritize the corporations harming our environment over the people affected by climate change each day. Be a #ClimateVoter and make the right choice for our environment. #OurGlobalWarning #StopKavanaugh https://t.co/t9mgeQFfah https://t.co/pTimk2Tl82
The campaigns that we see in DC surrounding initiative 77 can be seen in cities across the country. "Employers create tactics to scare workers into not advocating for themselves," says @BrittanyA___
"People look to something like initiative 77 to close the gap-- to close the wage gap, and to close the inequality gap," says @BrittanyA___
Most states, and the district, have two types of minimum wages, a general minimum wage and a sub-minimum wage for workers who earn tips. @BrittanyA___  explains, "Initiative 77 would gradually eliminate the two-tiered system."
We are now joined by @BrittanyA___ from @DCFPI to talk about initiative 77, a ballot initiative in DC that would have raised the minimum wage for tipped workers. The DC city council has come out against the initiative, overruling DC residents.
There's many unfortunate guidelines found in the proposed rule. One such guideline is setting a deadline on when to submit a fraud claim. @Sara_A_Garcia says: "There's a three year time limit to submit a claim, but many students don't realized that they've been scammed."
Once again @usedgov is not looking out for the most marginalized. As @Sara_A_Garcia said, the rule is "something that disproportionately hurts low income folks and people of color."
The proposed rule from the Department is simply put not good for defrauded borrowers. @SenyaSimron reminds us: "It's important to remember this is not a legislative law, this is a rule from the executive branch where borrowers have a chance to weigh in."
Today the @usedgov released a proposed rule that will make it harder for student loan borrowers cheated by predatory schools to get their loans forgiven. https://t.co/dmCZ73Ygsu

There's many ways to help families being separated at the border. One need from @TXCivilRights is for attorneys who can take on asylum cases. If you want to learn the many ways to help families being separated at the border visit https://t.co/vGDX6PnTtL
"There's a drop off in the public interest," says @zenenjp. But we all need to work together to stop the "zero-tolerance" policy being pushed by the Trump administration.
.@TXCivilRights is working every day to free children and young people held in cages by Trump's administration. @zenenjp says that "a big chunk of our clients are between the ages of 18 and 24," and are people who've fled violence in their countries.
The court order that halted Trump's family separation policy helped in one way, but @zenenjp says that revealed a grim picture. "We now know that more than 3,000 people were separated and there was no plan for reunification."
We're now joined by @zenenjp who has been at the border with @TXCivilRights working to help families separated and incarcerated by Trump's disastrous policies. #KeepFamilesTogether
To learn more about the work of @alex_steele316 and @adiecoop check out @DefendOurFuture. And if you have your own climate change stories, share it with us at: https://t.co/5VF8ebBvDr
Young people are the key to fighting back against the climate-deniers in Congress. @alex_steele316  gets it right: "If young people are showing up at the polls-- guess what-- we'll have a lot more climate leaders in Congress!"
"Earlier this year the trump administrator was trying to slash the EPA budget by a third. We beat that back," says @alex_steele316. "Those are wins and they show that when young people organize, change is possible and change can happen."
By the time he resigned, Pruitt was under multiple investigations. Although he's gone now, his dangerous policies are still there. "Scott Pruitt resigned because of his scandals-- not because of his policies," says @adiecoop from @DefendOurFuture
While former EPA Administrator resigned earlier this month, @Claire_Moser says "Andrew Wheeler is Scott Pruitt's hand-picked replacement." #BootPruitt
We got a super jam-packed @LeslieMarshall Show coming up! Join @maggiekthompson with guests @Claire_Moser, @alex_steele316, and @adiecoop to talk a post-Pruitt EPA. Later we are joined by @zenenjp to discuss the migrant children crisis. Follow live: https://t.co/krTQ5Ot6FF
While Trump's administration is in turmoil, judicial nominations should pause. Brett Kavanaugh is bad for SCOTUS, and David Porter is bad for Pennsylvania. These men are looking out for the mega-rich and corporations, not young people. #PuntPorter #ProtectOurCourts #SaveSCOTUS

Thank you @cedsaidso from @civilrightsorg and Blaine from @CAPSecurity for joining us for our #MillennialTakeover to talk SCOTUS and China! https://t.co/is5iVXDnnj
"The Trump administration is using a tit for tat tariff approach for what they view as a decease of a trade deficit between the US and China, but a deficit or surplus is not the best metric to view a trade relationship," says Blaine
Trump's economic policy on China is not just hurting American workers, but our allies around the country. "This approach of unilateral tariffs are analogous to going to battle with your friends and shooting around the room," says Blaine.
We are now joined by Blaine Johnson from CAP's @CAPSecurity team to catch us up to speed on China, trade, and tariffs!
#WhatsAtStake with Kavanaugh is reproductive rights and much more! "Reproductive rights doesn't just mean abortion-- it means access to healthcare that is holistic... it won't only affect a certain constituent like women, it will affect entire families," says @cedsaidso
The Senate has the power to vote on all Supreme Court justices. "We have to keep in mind that we can hold the Senate accountable for this nomination. At the end of the day what we need is a fair minded jurist," says @cedsaidso from @civilrightsorg #SaveSCOTUS
With Brett Kavanaugh's nomination @cedsaidso worries about what he would mean for the human rights of all. "This is not someone who would be a friend to civil and human rights communities," says Cedric. #SaveSCOTUS
Join @maggiekthompson for the #MillennialTakeover of the @LeslieMarshall Show! Today we'll be talking #SCOTUS and Kavenaugh with @civilrightsorg's Cedric Lawson, and China, trade, and tariffs with @amprog's Blaine Johnson. Follow along live: https://t.co/pGd3dWtZGy

For many women, especially young, low-income, and women of color, @PPFA and other Title X providers are the only places they can depend on for safe and reliable reproductive health resources. Trump's Gag Rule leaves all their futures at risk. #NoGagRule
Young people know that Title X clinics provide women with far more resources than abortion, like medical exams, family planning services, and contraception. Trump's #GagRule won't decrease abortions in the US, it will just limit the number of safe ones.

Visibility is still important. @Lahudelina credits the work of @HRC as the reason he became involved in LGBTQ activism. Once he found the work of HRC he saw possibility models. "I see myself doing this. I see other people like me being Afro-Latino and openly gay." #PrideMonth

At the core of cases like #MasterpieceCakeshop and the #MuslumBan is the right of people to celebrate. @TheDursoIsIn says "this impacts people in their daily life, at crucial moments in their life. How horribly cruel to deny people those moments with their families to celebrate."
It's expected that SCOTUS will rule on Trump's Muslim Ban very soon. There's been many tweaks made to the ban but @SirineShebaya explains what's behind it, "throughout his campaign Trump said he wanted a total and complete ban of Muslims coming into the U.S." #NoBanNoWall
This Monday the Supreme Court ruled on the #MasterpieceCakeshop case, @TheDursoIsIn from @LGBTProgress says the case is much more about just cake, at the core of the case is the issue of whether queer and trans people can have access to goods and services. #OpenToAll

‚ÄúWe know that climate change is not causing hurricanes to form but is absolutely changing the ways that hurricanes are forming in the way that climate change is forming stronger hurricanes and tropical storms,‚Äù says @CathleenMOKelly
What can people on the mainland do to help people in Puerto Rico? ‚ÄúI think people in Puerto Rico would want people to know that these issues have not ended and that they didn‚Äôt start with hurricane Maria,‚Äù says @Connor__Maxwell
‚ÄúThe lack of translators kept people from accessing the resources that they need,‚Äù says @CathleenMOKelly. ‚ÄúTh way that the aid is being distributing is aiding the way that poor people are being pushed out for wealthy developers.‚Äù
A recent study reveals that more than 4,600 people died in Puerto Rico due to hurricane Maria, dwarfing the official report that left the death toll at 64. @CathleenMOKelly says the new report highlights how marginalized communities were ignored. https://t.co/WpRDbpnvVk
.@Connor__Maxwell visited Puerto Rico recently where tourism is a large part of their economy. He says ‚Äúpeople should not be scared to go down, but people should be sensitive when they go down.‚Äù
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands experienced some of the longest blackouts in U.S. history. @CharlatAnne said her parents didn‚Äôt get electricity back until the holidays although the hurricane hit in September.
.@CharlatAnne is a native of the U.S. Virgin Islands. She says that while the vast majority of Virgin Islanders are of Afro-Caribbean heritage‚Äî  with most people identifying as Americans‚Äî they can‚Äôt vote.
‚ÄúThere are still thousands of people who don‚Äôt have electricity, who don‚Äôt have housing‚Äù says @Connor__Maxwell. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the lowest income residents, it‚Äôs the residents with African descent.‚Äù
.@CathleenMOKelly and @Connor__Maxwell recently visited Puerto Rico to take a first-hand look at how the island is doing today. Eight months after hurricane Maria, communities are still rebuilding, without access to support from FEMA, and struggling with bureaucratic barriers.

You can find more about Anthony's work across social media at @YouthJusticeLA! Thank you Anthony for all the great work that you and @YouthJusticeLA do at the local and national level!
Anthony started the Student Homie Union at his college campus to organize students around youth incarceration. The Youth Homie Union brings together students to advocate for formerly incarcerated youth and connect them with resources and a network of allies.
Anthony's story shows why the criminal justice system often makes it hard for young people to better their lives. "When I was put on probation I was charged $2,000 to pay for my own probation," says Anthony. That set him back financially even further.
"It's a continuous daily grind of systemic restrictions and systemic violence" says Anthony. "I got a felony about 3 and a half years ago. I've only had one real job since then and that was because they didn't have background checks."
Anthony Robles, an organizer with @YouthJusticeLA shares that growing up in Los Angeles he was heavily policed, which created hurdles for him getting an education. He started going to Black Lives Matters rallies that provided a springboard to local organizing.

In the meantime, everyone should continue to pressure their representatives by asking to vote in favor of a clean #DreamActNOW! To learn more about DACA renewals, visit https://t.co/qGKTDCrN2Y @UNITEDWEDREAM
This ruling also showed what we already knew: ending DACA was wrong. The decision to end DACA was cruel, it's hurting young people, and it's hurting communities. No matter what happens in the future, we will continue to stand alongside immigrant youth. #ProtectDREAMers
The federal judge gave the Administration 90 days to further explain its legal reasoning for ending #DACA. No one knows for sure what will happen in the next few months. What is certain though, is that if you qualify for renewal you should do so ASAP.
However, this ruling DOES NOT mean that those that qualify for DACA, but have never applied, can now apply. In other words, new DACA applications are not being accepted, just renewals. üò†
If you currently have #DACA or did previously, you can still renew. In other words, if your DACA is about to expire, you should apply for renewal. Similarly, if your DACA has already expired, you can still apply for a renewal.
A federal judge ruled that ending the DACA program was ‚Äúarbitrary and capricious because the [Homeland Security] Department failed adequately to explain its conclusion that the program was unlawful.‚Äù

Recently the Trump administration released a letter saying that states could ask for work requirements in order for people to get Medicaid. Many people are at risk of losing care says Theresa Chalhoub.
On Medicaid, "It's not a Republican or Democrat issue, it's a people issue" says Maani Stewart
"Young adults have always been the highest uninsured age group" says @THuelskoetter, but the ACA helped to improve coverage.
In Virginia the fight is on to get Medicaid expansion. "The debate is really about the state budget for the next year and whether to expand Medicaid" says Maani.

"If you look at the stats, only 3% of staff are Latino," says @CarlosAngeles25 of Congressional staff. He says that in order to increase that number and have a more diverse group of Congressional staffers, offices must pay interns, which allows people to move up to staff members.
Thanks to the work of @payourintern the @DNC now pays their interns.
"Without an internship you cannot get a job, but since most are unpaid that prices out a lot of folks," says @CarlosAngeles25
.@CarlosAngeles25 started @payourinterns after a couple of unpaid internships in Washington, DC. Now he's fighting to make sure other young people can get paid for their contributions!

Thank you @Rep_Higgins and @zacbears for your commitment to protecting student loan borrowers. We'll be watching closely what happens in Massachusetts soon! That's a wrap for today's episode, join us next Wednesday for another #MillennialTakeover of the @LeslieMarshall show!
To check out the great work being done on the ground in Massachusetts to protect student loan borrowers visit @MassPHENOM!
"In Massachusetts 75% of households see student debt as a top issue" says @zacbears
Recently lobbyists stripped a key provision from Maryland's bill to protect borrowers that would have allowed the state to regulate student loan servicing companies. "We have had some success pushing back against the student loan lobby" in Massachusetts says @zacbears
In the face of Betsy Devos' roll backs of protections for borrowers, @Rep_Higgins says "our Attorney General has stepped up for student loan borrowers." Thank you @MassAGO
"Under the Obama administration we had some protections [for student loan borrowers], we had an ombudsman. but the reality is that unfortunately the federal government is stepping back" says @Rep_Higgins
When do the shady practices from student loan companies like Navient and Great Lakes start? "It starts the first year of college" says @zacbears, when students aren't clearly told how many loans they're taking out.
We are now live with @Rep_Higgins and @zacbears calling in directly from Massachusetts. Last week the Massachusetts House passed a bill to protect student loan borrowers from predatory student loan companies!
.@jdlamond has a plan for young people to act on Trump and Russia. Visit https://t.co/CtSJC3OHnu to learn more about Trump's connections to Russia and how to get involved!
"The ties between the @NRA and Russia go way back" says @jdlamond, with Trump campaign officials and high-power NRA members meeting with US-sanctioned Russian figures in Russia.
If Special Counsel Mueller or Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein are fired, it would be an attack on our democracy and a clear attack on the rule of law.
"What I'm looking for next is something on cyber activity" says @jdlamond.
RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA! üá∑üá∫ The news media is all in on Trump and Russia. To discern and breakdown the fast-moving news, the @moscow_project analyzes the FBI's ongoing investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 election and intervention from Trump's campaign.
