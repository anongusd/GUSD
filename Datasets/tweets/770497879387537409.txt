The shutdown over President Trump's demand for border wall funds has  broken the record for the longest stoppage in U.S. history. Today is Day  22, edging out the previous record of 21 days in 1995-96 under Bill  Clinton.	https://t.co/7KlHuGI6D0

GOFUNDME SCAM / FRAUD: After his Facebook ban, Kolfage started a GoFundMe page imploring people to donate to help him ‚Äústop social media censorship.‚Äù	https://t.co/QWVD9xhO7k
GOFUNDME SCAM/FRAUD: Just as his new business was growing _ Kolfage claimed he spent $300,000 on ads to attract some 3.5 million followers_Facebook removed pages associated with Kolfage‚Äôs websites in Oct. as part of a crack down on ‚Äúinauthentic behavior.‚Äù https://t.co/QWVD9xhO7k
GOFUNDME FRAUD:  The campaign, however, is only the most high-profile part of Kolfage‚Äôs  email harvesting operation, which former employees told NBC News extends  back to his creation of far-right news websites ‚Äî an effort that  resulted in a Facebook ban.	https://t.co/QWVD9xhO7k
GOFUNDME FRAUD: 	GoFundMe says it has no hand in refunding those funds.	‚ÄúWe  process refunds for donations made online through GoFundMe. That does  not include any offline donations,‚Äù the spokesperson said.	https://t.co/QWVD9xhO7k
GOFUNDME FRAUD: Kolfage also used GoFundMe to solicit donations by check to a P.O. Box in Colorado, manned by former Freedom Daily writer Amanda Shea.	https://t.co/QWVD9xhO7k
FRAUD! A spokesperson for GoFundMe told NBC News that all donors would be  refunded because Kolfage had changed the language midcampaign, erasing  an earlier pledge to ‚Äúrefund every single penny‚Äù if the goal of $1  billion was not met.	https://t.co/QWVD9xhO7k
Six days after the campaign was launched, it was edited to include a new  call: "AFTER DONATING, SIGN OUR PETITION WE NEED 100 million  signatures.‚Äù The text repeats four times at the top of the page before  any description about the fundraiser itself.	https://t.co/QWVD9xhO7k
Kolfage has repeatedly created GoFundMe campaigns and published  inflammatory fake news articles, pushing them both from websites that he  sought to hide behind shell companies and false identities, in part to  harvest email addresses.	https://t.co/QWVD9xhO7k

For the first time during Trump's  presidency, though, Trump is more  disliked than Pelosi. She has become more popular since the Democrats  won in November. Her net  favorability rating rose in Gallup's polling  from -24 points in June to  -10 points now in Gallup polling.....
.... In fact, it's Pelosi's best net  favorability rating in a Gallup poll in 10 years. The most recent CNN and NBC/Wall Street Journal polls have made similar findings: Pelosi is on the rise.
