@MinnesotaMiners @GovTimWalz I met with folks from Likely, BC who live along Quesnel Lake when they came to Duluth a year ago. Your rosy picture of Mount Polley is completely false. Talk to folks who live there, and stop repeating talking points.
@MinnesotaMiners @GovTimWalz Oh yes, Mount Polley. After years of “modern copper mining is totally safe!” talking points one spills its guts into an alpine lake and the expert panel investigating recommends no more wet tailings. You’re right - totally irrelevant.
@MinnesotaMiners @GovTimWalz Of course terrain has an influence on dam construction. But so does how the dam itself is constructed. Downstream and centerline designs are more stable than upstream regardless of terrain. Dry stack tailings are safer still.
@MinnesotaMiners @GovTimWalz One last thing - Brazil in the dark ages? They just banned this design. They just required rapid decommissioning of all upstream dams. MN is behind Brazil. Good argument.
@MinnesotaMiners @GovTimWalz You can repeat PolyMet’s PR spin all you want but don’t come up on my timeline and call me a liar. I’ll show up anywhere you want and debate you straight up. Bring it on.
@MinnesotaMiners @GovTimWalz Terrain has literally nothing to do with why upstream dams are dangerous. You keep spinning and deflecting, but the rest of the world is quickly moving away from the design because it is dangerous.
Hey groundhog - 		YOU’RE FIRED
Same dam design. Same dam consulting engineers. Same dam method to predict if it's safe. PolyMet &amp; the Brazilian mine dam disaster are directly connected. Same dam result in MN? It's up to you! TAKE ACTION ---&gt; https://t.co/dzkywOwwvs

@broomtorowicz To be clear - I don't mean that *you* don't know ATC haven't been paid - that the public at large is being kept in the dark.
@broomtorowicz The Trump strategy for riding out the shutdown is to call back employees to work unpaid so the public will not notice, it requires some sort of action like this. I mean, you may not know the air traffic controllers haven't been paid in a month, but it does matter.
And another thing - I love how "thousands of comments" is now some sort of evidence for a "thorough process" when the reality is that 98% of them oppose the PolyMet proposal and the regulators simply ignored them. https://t.co/RbWuh791vf

Two other maps (via @morningtake, done by @dhmontgomery) summarize the suburban "big sort" that happened last night.

@bbierschbach me too - only loose thread is 27B (Poppe) which is an R pick up opportunity
Congrats to @julieblaha! You're going to be a great State Auditor. Well done!
The final #mnleg House tally (as I see it): 17 R to D flips, 1 recount with DFL leading by 3 votes (5A), 27B left to come in (D seat with Jean Poppe right now). So net +16 to +18, which means a House majority of 72-74 members for presumptive Speaker @melissahortman.
Deer River Township P-1 is the one precinct left in 5A. That precinct had zero votes in 2016. So this means that John Persell has won 5A by 3 votes and there will be a mandatory recount. #mnleg
Somehow 5A goes closer ... it was 9 votes with 4 precincts left, now it is a 3 vote margin with 2 precincts left to report #mnleg https://t.co/OJ6gFuU0Qx
39B goes blue as well, with Christensen (DFL) defeating Lohmer (R). That's +17 swing for DFL so far. #mnleg

Current list on @mnhouseDFL pickups +16 (14B, 33B, 34B, 36A, 38B, 42A, 44A, 48B, 49A, 52B, 53B, 54A, 55A, 56A, 56B, 57B) Leading in 39B. 5A is razor thin. 25A still possible. Only R pick up chance is 27B (3/42 precincts in) #mnleg +17 or +18 likely. 74-63 majority?
Two remaining #mnleg DFL pickup opportunities - 39B looks tight - 400 vote lead but the two precincts left are in Lake Elmo - Lohmer territory. 54A just came in and Anne Claflin won! A scientist in the House! #mnleg https://t.co/0Nh7qNsFvG

Kelly Moller up big in 42A, which is another pickup for @mnhouseDFL - that's +14 already. #mnleg https://t.co/USQx1J6Jjf
RT @TonyAngelo: Alice Mann is up by almost 1,000 votes with one precinct left in 56B, another almost certain DFL pickup!
@dbly Thanks - sorry for the error.
Make that 12 pickups - @amiwazlawik has an 800 vote lead in 38B and will win that one too! #mnleg https://t.co/hlt1dvBvYv
That's 11 pickups for DFL (14B, 33B, 34B, 36A, 44A, 48B, 49A, 52B, 55A, 56A, 57B) and 5 pickup opps left (38B, 39B, 42A, 53B, 54A) and 2 GOP flip opps (20A, 27B). Needing a +11 result, it looks very likely @mnhouseDFL will take control of #mnleg House.
RT @dbrauer: Sounds great! And highly plausible. MAJOR WIN FOR JUSTICE IN HENNEPIN COUNTY. https://t.co/QC4pqkbb8B
RT @TonyAngelo: John Huot wins in 57B, another DFL pickup!
It may look grim for DFLer Lippert in 20A, down by 1000 votes, but look again - none of the Northfield precincts have reported yet and nearly all of the vote remaining should favor him. If DFL holds this seat (currently held by @dbly) that may seal it. #mnleg https://t.co/GD9YHK2YKk
With a 3000 vote lead in the MN 13 special, it seem that the MN Senate will stay 34-33 in the hands of the GOP. #mnleg https://t.co/JbiREpmqI5
RT @bbierschbach: Operatives on both sides telling me it looks likely the Minnesota House will flip to Democrats with more than the 11 seat…
Keep an eye on 27B (Jeanne Poppe) for a potential R pick up opportunity. #mnleg
So far, no sign of a R flipping a DFL seat. Open seats in Apple Valley, Mankato, elsewhere look safe. #mnleg
So far, 10 House flips for DFL #mnleg. 14B, 33B, 34B, 36A, 44A, 48B, 49A, 52B, 55A, 56A. 5A, 42A and 57B look good so far, 53A and 54B are both in play. DFL needs net 11 seat swing.
RT @TonyAngelo: Hutch's lead back up to over 3,300 with 6 precincts left now. This one is over. Hutch wins.
@TheDailyRep https://t.co/e0x4r8YcfQ
@TheDailyRep It sounded like MSNBC did, but that may be premature, I was just RTing what I saw.
US House has flipped with at least 220 seats. The MN House looks to be heading that way too! Combined with wins by Phillips, Craig, Walz, Smith and Klobuchar, this could be a very a good night to be a DFLer!
RT @JohnCroman: DFL crowd reacts to Angie Craig call on @MSNBC https://t.co/enmEtVKkGa
Another DFL House flip in 56A - Hunter Cantrell (DFL) up about 1000 votes over Drew Christensen (R) with one precinct left. #mnleg https://t.co/qIJ523kMsr
@KathyLohmer has retaken the lead in 39B by 19 votes with 10/16 precincts reporting. This is super close. #mnleg https://t.co/LZMLFEXXeR
Ami Wazlawik (DFL) in a very tight race against Patti Anderson (R) in 38B. 30 votes ahead with 8/13 precincts reporting. #mnleg
Kelly Moller (DFL) out to 600 vote lead in 42A over Randy Jessup (R) - this is a key race for House control. 42A was flipped in 2016 from D to R. #mnleg https://t.co/OUkVdojIgj
Nolan West (R) hangs on by about 150 votes in 37B, defeating Amir Malik (DFL) #mnleg https://t.co/J5qA4iu9ke
None of the Duluth precincts are on the MN SOS site yet. And Joe Radinovich is doing very well there - up nearly 10,000 votes net over Stauber. That would erase Stauber's current lead. So watch for #mn08 ... it ain't over yet. https://t.co/tFAMaMJaWd
Former Rep. John Persell takes the lead in 5A. This would be a huge pickup for DFL House chances. About half the precincts are in. #mnleg https://t.co/derwr5bJKJ
Huge win for House DFL - flipping 55A from red to blue with a big win by @BradTabke! #mnleg https://t.co/8DJf5hrTQ2
Looks like 52B is flipping from red to blue as well - Richardson up by 1200 votes over Regina Barr (R) with just 3 precincts left. #mnleg https://t.co/d0ExduQ44D
RT @AP_Politics: BREAKING: Democrat Tim Walz wins election for governor in Minnesota. #APracecall at 9:49 p.m. CST. @AP election coverage:…
Help for DFL MN House prospects - Marquardt is looking strong early in 4B - so far, no sign that R's are flipping any DFL seats in House. #mnleg https://t.co/AQKQ7xCnRE
@Zero_Dice TIGHT. The key will be a few greater MN DFL incumbents and none of these votes are in yet (Jeanne Poppe, Marquardt) - Marquardt just posted a bunch and they look good. https://t.co/lfJBQgizAg
Dude, with 50% of Duluth precincts in, they are reporting nearly 74% turnout in Duluth. None of these have hit the SOS site yet. Radinovich is +6000 votes in Duluth over Stauber. Unfortunately, he's dragging behind other DFLers - Klobuchar is up over 9,000 over Newburger. #mn08 https://t.co/YQJMIvhBCO
Also, watch 42A, and 52B. Really, DFL already has half the seats they need and need to take about half of the toss up / lean seats left. So far no sign of an R pick up seat, though there are a few opportunities in greater MN. #mnleg
It looks like Jenifer Loon has lost in 48B, down 700 votes with just one precinct left #mnleg https://t.co/IK5CwGLvLy
So far, 5 DFL House pick ups - 33B, 34B, 36A, 44A, 49A - 48B looks good too. So that's 6. Races to watch - 57B, 37B, 5A, 39B, 14B, 33B. Trend line looks really close. #mnleg
33B - Cindy Pugh (R) is defeated by Kelly Morrison (DFL) - this is a big pick up for DFL House #mnleg https://t.co/0fLXw6QOMk
9/34 Duluth precincts in and @joeradinovich is doing pretty well there - up 62-34 - key for him is Skip Sandman only pulling 4% of vote in Duluth, which is not as bad as it could be for Radinovich. #mn08 https://t.co/7TPEb1iytb
R Greg Boe managed to squeak out a win in 47B by 120 votes to replace Joe @Repjoehoppe - this was another red west metro suburb district that ery nearly flipped. #mnleg https://t.co/wAmSennQv8
In 57B, Anna Wills (R) trails by ~700 votes with 5/13 precincts in. This is another key suburban race for DFL House hopes #mnleg https://t.co/TaKhvbsDBL
For DFL to flip House #mnleg, they need to hold all of their seats, and the @ErinMayeQuade 57A seat is looking pretty good with 1/2 of the precincts in - Bierman leads by 1500 votes. #mnleg https://t.co/UQYGkM1MaA
Cindy Pugh now down 170 votes with just one precinct left in 33B. That would be yet another CD3 MN House flip for DFL if it holds. #mnleg https://t.co/GbODXyyNHW
Another DFL House flip in 36A where DFLer Zack Stephenson looks to claim the seat previously held by Mark Uglem (R). #mnleg https://t.co/gpKrzp6VCA
Congrats to MAPL grad Erin Koegel (DFL) who really ran away with it in her previously close 37A district. That's Spring Lake Park/Blaine. This looks like a DFL House wave in the burbs, folks. #mnleg https://t.co/zO33gIFmX8
With one precinct left, Nolan West (R) is virtually tied with Amir Malik (DFL) in 37B. That race is a study of huge contrasts. #mnleg https://t.co/A6XQ3TKG1C
@dbrauer Yes
44B used to be a battleground district. In this cycle, the DFLer Patti Acomb is up by 27 points with just one precinct left to report. The West Metro is bleeding blue. Dean Phillips has serious coattails. #mnleg https://t.co/0sthEaI35F
Heather Edelson (DFL) has beaten Dario Anselmo (R) rather handily. This was a big pick up as well for the DFL. #mnleg https://t.co/Z69zLmbdOi
Watch this one - early numbers in 54A. Keith Franke (R) up against Anne Claflin (DFL). There has been a lot of DFL energy in this race, and with just a couple of precincts in it's close. A DFL pick up here would be a big sign of a flip in control of the House. #mnleg https://t.co/8tVSCDIxYO
Jenifer Loon (R)  is in a death match in 48B - virtually tied with 3 precincts left to go. #mnleg https://t.co/Sf2UHebRKM
In sum, the west suburbs, buoyed by Dean Phillips, the DFL has been cleaning up - in Minnetonka, Maple Grove and more. #mnleg
In 48A Laurie Pryor (DFL) has romped to a big nearly 20 point victory #mnleg https://t.co/16mSnoWmnr
In another key House race DFLer Ginny Klevorn looks to have beaten Sarah @Rep_SAnderson in 44A #mnleg - this was a Clinton district in 2016 but Anderson had won several times in spite of it. Up by 1400 with just 2 precincts left. https://t.co/zdPmEEPy4W
In another big shocker, DFLer Kristin Bahner is up over R Dennis Smith in 34B - she's up by 1200 votes with 2 precincts left, so that's a lock. #mnleg https://t.co/AGKkA2CkSe
In 33B Cindy Pugh (R) is trailing with 16/21 precincts in. This would be a big pick up for DFL hopes to take the House - it's really tight. #mnleg https://t.co/dUce6FWhKB
In 5B, another key swing rural district, Sandy Layman (R) has a strong lead with less than half in - Pat Medure (DFL) is former sheriff of Itasca County and well known in the district. Considered a strong candidate recruit for DFL. https://t.co/snGwv1tDm8
Key MN5A race is super tight with 1/3 of the vote in - Persell and Bliss virtually tied. https://t.co/sAfPKNtFID
RT @TomCoombe8: Stauber leads Ely 673-625.   Absentees yet to count
Dean Phillips looks like he has it - 66% in and he's up by 13% and 31,000 votes. Big win for the DFL if it holds. #mn03 and a big flip for the US House control battle. https://t.co/rik4dIbiTx
For now, Ellison is basically a proxy for a generic DFL constitutional candidate - he and Blaha are tracking (both have pot party candidates pulling about 5%) and he's not dragging behind. That is with CD5 and CD3 only, though, so we'll see if that trend holds. #mnag

@minnesotabrown @bryanhansel I mean, I make choices and I am about as realistic / jaded / cynical as you can get on this issue. But it’s folly to think everybody made their peace.
@minnesotabrown @bryanhansel I’m not talking about strategy. It’s more elemental than that. You’re thinking about this at 30,000 feet, not at ground level.
Really interesting to see so many R House incumbents run ads implying they are challengers. Lewis in #MN03 is the local example that springs to mind.
@minnesotabrown @bryanhansel And telling people who are angry and disappointed that they should have expected this isn’t a great motivating technique.
@minnesotabrown @bryanhansel That’s fair but this issue cuts both ways. If releasing permits now moves votes it will not be in one direction only.
@Jason_Buck Even if built or sold, It won’t matter to the execs and board who own 10% of the shares or Glencore who owns 43%. Between them they can make sure everybody who matters is taken care of.

It’s critical that our political leadership reflects the many walks of life of the people. Personally, I’m looking for leadership from people who personally understand the fragile and tenuous distance beteeen poverty and a middle class existence.
@JustinPerpich Until labor and environmental interests work together to develop a set of common sense standards that protect water, workers and people downstream, those who would use mining as nothing more than a political wedge issue will find fertile ground for their pandering.

Hey @HyVee - a month ago this article said the Spring Lake Park store would be open "soon." Any update? https://t.co/VPbA6hHWqn
And in the end, Sens. Collins and Murkowski succeeded in doing nothing but infuriating everybody and accomplishing nothing. Sen. McCain was complicated and I didn't always agree with him, but at times he actually did what he said he would.
"Moderate" has to mean something more than "I'll act uncomfortable and act like I care, but in the end I'll fold." If there is nothing principled about it, if there is not action, It's just another way to preserve your power while pretending to have divergent views.
One "moderate" says she's a "no vote" but votes present, allowing Kavanaugh to be confirmed. Another wanted an FBI investigation but voted yes to pass him out of committee. Another hemmed &amp; hawed but ultimately did what she was always going to do.

@DeRushaJ @tomlowrysghost probably for the best
That said, there is still a bunch of undecided/not sure, and the turnout question is pretty much dispositive. But R attempts to distance from Trump a la Lewis/Paulsen are clearly not working.
One trend I'm seeing across all of the recent polls (KSTP/SUSA, Strib/MPR MN Poll) is that Trump approval is pretty much the ceiling for all statewide/congressional R candidates. And that's bad for Republicans. #mnleg can be a bit different, but top of ticket is a huge influence.
@DanKellyJr @larryrjacobs To be clear, I think there is some reason to see that narrative in southern MN, I'm just always skeptical of drawing definitive conclusions from a small subsample. One thing is clear: Trump approval is pretty much the ceiling for R candidates this cycle, and that's bad for R's.
@WilhelmDavis Classic Lyin' @WilhelmDavis
Show me a Republican candidate for Congress who owns a business that pays part-time workers $15/hour AND provides health insurance, and I'll eat my hat.
@NARNfan And to be clear, I'm not a fan of either. But the notion that Wal Mart isn't predatory is laughable. Ask anybody who lived in a small town where a Supercenter opened on the edge and hollowed out their downtown. It's a story repeated endlessly. And now many of these are closing!
@NARNfan Look, I gotta stop you here. Amazon has dropped prices too and increased purchasing power. And they made tons of money, they were just plowing it back into the company - "not turning a profit" meant dumping cash into expansion. Wal Mart did similar - on both fronts.
@NARNfan I see the "ruling class" as a far more complex entity with competing interests and strategies to maintain and/or build their power, not a lumpen mass.
@NARNfan I dunno, I think they are remarkably similar stories of companies making big investments in changing retail paradigms. Why is Wal Mart better or different? Because they have brick and mortar stores? Seem arbitrary. It's not like Wal Mart helped the wage structure for workers.
@larryrjacobs n=160, margin of error around 7.8-8.0%
@larryrjacobs First, I'd be careful reading too much into southern MN subsample - it's gotta have a margin of sampling error around 8-9%. But second, what @jburcum said.
@NARNfan At some point, we are going to have to reckon with automation and distributed manufacturing. I'm not one of these "soon robots will do all the work" people, but there is a serious shift in the nature and quantity of work in industrialized countries that impacts monetary policy.
@NARNfan Also, it makes no sense to attack concentration of wealth only moving forward, while leaving inherited wealth untouched. It basically would freeze the concentration of wealth in the same families in which it exists now. Your approach is a recipe of multi-generational oligarchy.
@NARNfan I'm confused. So you're saying that we should start now to prevent wealth concentration in the hands of folks like Bezos, but "what did the Walton family do to deserve asset seizure?" I'm unclear why Bezos couldn't make the same argument.
@NARNfan I'd settle for actually enforcing a flat capitol gains tax but I'm all ears for how to go further. I'd also suggest that an estate tax is even more important.

Another interesting thing about this KSTP/SUSA poll. The likely voter sample breaks 53-43 Trump disapprove, 4 unsure. Reg voters 50-40-10. If 53% of actual voters disapprove of Trump, GOP is in a tough spot. #mn2018
Interestingly the registered voters Q shows 50/50 which means their likely voter model skews it more male. https://t.co/mIRPcEOkaA
One weird methodology thing about this KSTP/SUSA poll is how many people they surveyed (over 1000) but then they report the races as likely voters n=574 and the issue Qs as registered voters n=920. Wonder what the reg and full samples showed for the #mn2018 races?
From KSTP/SUSA - compare these numbers breaking down urban/suburban/rural split. Burbs are battleground, but turnout and relative edge in urban/rural probably is determinative in the #mn2018 races. https://t.co/iM6WdYZ70P
If you read the KSTP/SUSA closely on Ellison, here’s what it looks like. Allegations are cited more by Trump supporters as factor, but there are more unsure on AG race in Trump disapproves. Clearly some otherwise DFL voters aren’t backing Ellison now/yet. #mnag https://t.co/oQUZ4xjbX6

What’s going on? In one word: Trump. Nearly all of these races are tracking the Trump approval question, which is 40-50 disapprove. #mngov #mnsen https://t.co/2htK6cbdqI
Interestingly the gender split holds in the Ellison/Wardlow race and the abuse allegations appear to be affecting more of the men voting than women #MNAG https://t.co/IBV9aJ9fNr

I'm also confused by folks posting about how "superdelegates don't matter because caucuses." I don't get it. They're separate issues.
@javimorillo @AndreaKiepe That's fair, but I am getting a little bit weary of people touting primaries as "the will of the people" and such without recognizing how low the turnout is.

RT @TomCoombe8: Question and answer session with lawyers opposing Twin Metals project included bizarre exchange as audience member charged…
If CAE really means it when they say that "we have strong regulations" then they should join environmentalists in defending them and ensuring that we implement them.
In short, the CAE report is another in a long line of similar efforts - wishful thinking and boosterism mixed with partisan politicking and pandering, all blind to reality. As somebody once said "it's the economics, stupid."
This is the same fate as the PolyMet boosters, such as Sen. Bakk who stood on a stage in 2009 and declared that it would transform the whole industrial economy (!) as copper manufacturers would co-located to be next to the mine. Um ... yeah, no. https://t.co/gAqlWJD2hw
Consider too, the MSI/Essar/ERP/Whoeverthehellownsitnow site - they got a permit to mine in 2008 (!) but lack of financing has doomed the project to multiple bankruptcies. The original vision of a steel plant alongside a taconite mine is long gone.
The taxpayers of Minnesota via DEED and IRRRB lost over $550k because they had invested in Duluth Metals stock. It was the only company DEED owned stock in. Sen. Tomassoni said "it's worth any risk" to invest. https://t.co/K6aeWU2S2O
The Twin Metals project fell apart in 2014 when a pre-feasibility study showed $2.8 billion cost to develop the "underground city" that boosters were pumping up. And the 13.6% rate of return projected was also not economically viable. https://t.co/K6aeWU2S2O
Even the well-known PolyMet deposit still lacks money to actually develop it. In an environment of falling copper prices, they are not economically viable. PolyMet's 9.6% rate of return estimated in their securities filings is well below 20-30% needed. https://t.co/tm5jihuzB5
CAE cites ilmenite, but they're plagued by contaminants making ore difficult to process. The Longnose deposit, known since 1958 has been abandoned repeatedly. NRRI research to address it has no takers to finance beyond the pilot stage. https://t.co/xqs5pWkOVK
CAE says we have the largest undeveloped nickel deposit in the world. Well, 20-25% are nickel silicate forms that are impossible to process. PolyMet, for example, projects &lt; 80% metal recovery for their nickel. This is their pilot study on recovery rates. https://t.co/yDlYCYRoz7 https://t.co/fARZv57CJV
Geologists have known about these deposits since the 50's, well before we had modern environmental laws. Waves of interest in developing them coincide with spikes in metal prices. Then, when prices cool, so does interest. Why? Because they are marginal deposits at best.

I have lots of thoughts on this "report." But let's start with the obvious one - there are reasons why we have this big deposit of minerals in northern Minnesota but nobody is mining it. And 90% of it has nothing to do with environmental regulations. https://t.co/j2PSmrsE5G
@roblevine82 @mplsfoundation This report is rehash of the same tired arguments we've heard for years. The difference is that they're going to spend $270k to push out the same tired false arguments.

One common thread across nearly all of the campaigns that won last night or outperformed expectations - early organizing and rapid reaction to seize opportunities. Most of the late entrants struggled to gain traction, even where they looked to have an advantage.
Duluth showed that it's not at all like the rest of #MN08 last night. The strong result of Michelle Lee &amp; Erin Murphy among Duluth DFLers show that the Radinovich and Was campaigns have work to do in building bridges there. Turnout in Duluth will be critical in #MN08, especially.
One more thing: the metro, particularly #MN05, really was the difference for @Tim_Walz last night. By the time the somehow always delayed St. Louis County results were posted, the race was over. One could argue it was over by the time Hennepin County came in - before 9 PM.
Whoda thunk that the #MN05 DFL endorsement would have greater impact on that race than the statewide endorsements? Well, it did. @IlhanMN claiming that endorsement knee-capped progressive challenger PTR by rapidly organizing and winning it.
The winners are the early backers of the Walz campaign, the loyalists to Jeff Johnson and Jennifer Carnahan, where the GOP primary voters largely ratified the endorsement process. Meanwhile, on the DFL side, the endorsement process was again weakened.
Political families that lost big last night (cont'd):	- The Nolan political family, whose young activist core abandoned ship in response to the bad behavior and coverup for Nolan's old cronies	The political families that won:
Political 'families' that lost big last night:	- Hatch/Swanson family, backed by old guard Minneapolis DFL (don't miss the significance of Jax as the campaign party location)	- Pawlenty family, the core of which emerged from Grunseth's 1990 loss &amp; formed MN exec branch from 02-10
.@epmurphymn showed true grit and campaigned harder than nearly anybody I've seen. I'm sad that she won't be taking the #PoliticsOfJoy all the way ... this time.

With the Gov and AG results, the Hatch camp and the Nolan camp (whatever is left of it) have been bounced from the DFL for now. What a reversal from what looked like Swanson coasting to an AG win and Nolan getting millions in national support for #MN08 re-elect.

@lapared Only about 10% of the precincts there
That said, unless there is some incredibly strong and surprising result in #MN08, I think we can rule out a Swanson/Nolan win. #mngov
Gonna be hard for Murphy with only a 4000 vote lead in #MN05. Very strong result for Walz. #MN04 not in yet, though, which gives Murphy another shot at building an urban metro lead. #mngov https://t.co/DMZHvqKHWk
@JeffMPR It's to make everybody think St. Louis County decides every election. It's a strategy. The phones work just fine up there, trust me.
About 1/3 of the precinct in are #MN05 so far, so the 41-36 lead for Walz looks pretty formidable. No #MN08 in yet. Ilhan Omar looks like she's got it in #MN05 with over half reporting already, she leads 48-31. #mngov

Asked why voters should choose her over @IlhanMN, @TorresRayMN notes she was the first elected supporter of Ilhan Omar but that she was in a similar position 12 years ago and that MNans expect results and you need the time &amp; experience to deliver. #MN05
“I’m a progressive Democrat who is not afraid to challenge my own caucus. I’ve been doing it for the last 12 years and I will continue to do so.” @TorresRayMN mentions environmental issues as one example. https://t.co/DgH9cJXkAx
@TorresRayMN touts her experience turning out vote through multi-ethnic and multi-generational organizing in #MN05 &amp; her potential membership in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus as reasons she would be a strong member of Congress. https://t.co/ywDLGRVzpC
Q: What’s your position on guns? @TorresRayMN: I believe we need to have strong background checks, but in order to make progress on gun reform we need to take a hard look at money in politics. https://t.co/LGPc24kxhm

@TonyYarusso Still if the goal is to deny an endorsement to your opponent this was bad strategy anyway
5) lastly, campaign staff and tactics matter a great deal on days like this. The Murphy campaign was well prepared, had a clear 2nd choice strategy for delegates, and executed. They stayed positive on message and were patient. And Murphy gave a great speech too. #DFL2018
4) the Lori Swanson / Matt Pelikan endorsement battle for AG was bizarre. Swanson didn’t even speak for her own endorsement. It’s hard to discern the strategy here. Why even bother to contest it?
3) The Walz campaign pulled the plug too early and the move to no endorsement felt kind of desperate. They may have ground out a draw, but getting the convention to no endorsement was a harder lift than neither getting to 60%. #DFL2018
2) As an Otto supporter I was confused and disappointed by the no endorsement move with Walz. It didn’t feel strategic and it didn’t work either.
Helluva #DFL2018 convention today. A couple of thoughts. 1) Congrats to @epmurphymn and her campaign who executed as they have throughout the campaign.

@MNBuffalo I was a Rybak delegate and got personally yelled at by MAK on the convention floor. It's a treasured memory.
@MNBuffalo Yeah, and I prefer open primaries and no ID for ease of voting. I have to say that jungle primaries with top two advancing are intriguing, though I can see ways to game it. Then again, all systems can be gamed.
@MNBuffalo I definitely agree on the super delegates. Saw in 2010 how much that biases the convention, esp. when one candidate is a legislative leader. Not trying to pick on one person, but that was particularly clear (with 80+ House DFL member super delegates alone)
@MNBuffalo Just think - the primary was in September until they moved it up (a little) to August
@MNBuffalo I'm conflicted about the caucuses, but I agree that an earlier primary is needed regardless. Just tired of seeing people flip-flop on this with no regard for consistency.

Wait, so @USRepRickNolan's endorsement of @joeradinovich was just for the last three ballots of the #MN08 convention and he's going to "reserve judgement" before deciding who to endorse in the primary? https://t.co/2uFElGg8Mv
@PhoenixWomanMN I think the Nolan endorsement is more about trying to keep Metsa from running in the primary. Just guessing.
@PhoenixWomanMN When Metsa dropped his 20% of the delegates went 6% to Phifer, 7% to Radinovich and 7% to no endorsement.
@PhoenixWomanMN @Phifer4Congress You're right, the party could have unified behind Phifer and we could have avoided this.
@PhoenixWomanMN I think another lesson from this is that Nolan would have struggled to get an endorsement if he's not dropped out of the race.
@PhoenixWomanMN This was several ballots after Metsa dropped. My point was that Nolan's endorsement didn't change the dynamic of the convention.
Congratulations to @Phifer4Congress who led on all 10 ballots at the #MN08 convention!

@MarkGisleson Also, I don't understand how living too long should exhaust an insurance benefit - all it means is that she has been paying her premium LONGER than actuaries projected. They are making more money off the premium AND walking away from the benefit.
We could even require it to be the same blaze pink the #mnleg was so obsessed with last two sessions.
How about this? AR-15s can only be sold if they are colored bright pink.
@NARNfan Mass shooters COULD choose any number of functionally equivalent semi-auto rifles - so why do they choose AR-15s over and over again?
@NARNfan There's no 2A right to a gun that LOOKS a certain way.
@NARNfan So to me, the argument "AR-15 is functionally same as any semi-auto" isn't an argument for "can't regulate AR-15s without banning all semi-autos" it's the opposite. We can regulate/tax/ban it because there are functional equivalents available to everybody.
@NARNfan See, this is where I depart from a lot of folks. The cosmetics of the AR-15 ARE the attraction for a lot of mass shooters. I don't care if that means picking on non-functional aspects of the AR-15. The psuedo-military style is the reason it sells, why it's attractive.
Earlier tweet stolen from @jamrockstar with a slightly different twist.
How about a tax on high capacity magazines, AR-15s and ammunition to pay for public health research into gun violence, school safety improvements, school counselors, and mental health resources?

@NARNfan It’s a critical metric for these kinds of projects and is pretty well benchmarked. 9.6 is pathetically low - remember you can buy S and P Index finds and expect 5-6% with high diversification. Mining projects need 30% because they’re so risky.

@FooteAl If your idea of protecting the BWCA is "cross your fingers and hope" I'm gonna go with "yeah, that's nothing more than wishful thinking."
@FooteAl No, this is an "appeal" to scientific research, the historical record of similar mining operations &amp; actual analysis, as opposed to your opinion. All of which are the actual basis for the protective actions taken by the USFS and BLM, as opposed to your myth of "low info."
@FooteAl And for the record, I was 4 years old when the 1978 BWCA Wilderness Act was passed, so I'm pretty sure I wasn't involved in "picking acreage."
@FooteAl Well, we are all relieved that you're still not concerned. I provided a memo from the head of the Forest Service that cites peer-reviewed research. Who is the "low info" person, exactly?
This is what we are training our teachers to do - to control the bleeding of their students. https://t.co/6Sk9kTrIYK
@FooteAl A minute ago, there was no risk. Now you're admitting there is. A minute ago, we "have some of the strictest environmental laws." Now you are admitting we should have expanded the size of the wilderness to protect its water? Okay then.
@FooteAl To save you some time, here's a key passage - of 14 existing US mines of this type 100% have had pipeline failures, 13/14 had water collection and treatment fail, 9 had tailings spills ... "potentially devastating consequences" for the BWCA. https://t.co/XRV30MM4Uf

Soon afterward, PolyMet eliminated the plant that could create cathode copper on site from their plan. They now plan to create no value-added jobs, and will ship their copper concentrate overseas to be smelted, probably in Indonesia, the Philippines or China.

@JustinPerpich It takes a lot of chutzpah to turn "I'd support Flanagan for Gov if that was an option" into "what do you have against Peggy Flanagan?"
@JustinPerpich "Co-governor" is not a thing. You are literally making this up. There is no example in MN history of this working that way.

@JustinPerpich @RepKeithEllison @RickNolanMN @RepGosar It's the dishonesty and lying that I can't countenance. It's not like Oberstar was anti-mining. I strongly disliked his stance on BWCA issues. But he never lied to people. I respected that.
@JustinPerpich @RepKeithEllison @RickNolanMN @RepGosar And let me be clear, it's not like Emmer's the greatest tactician in the world. But after years of attacking anybody who doesn't sound like Tom Rukavina on mining, this is what you get. Well played.
@JustinPerpich @RepKeithEllison @RickNolanMN @RepGosar The game where you fall headlong into Emmer's trap then act like everybody criticizing you is the problem. I mean, come on. People can only take so much duplicity, double dealing and trying to have it both ways.

@JustinPerpich @RepKeithEllison @RickNolanMN @RepGosar Nice dodge. A minute ago you were like "Gosar? Oh that guy? Pretty sure Emmer let him tag along." Now you're like "But Pelosi!" So, which is it?
@JustinPerpich @RepKeithEllison @RickNolanMN @RepGosar Gosar carried Nolan's HR3115 in committee. You can play dumb if you want, but Gosar didn't just wander in off the street because Emmer asked him to. Meanwhile, Emmer's Ely council SOTU invite told Clinton voters to go kill themselves. Nice crowd there.
Remember if you hear anything about decorum from GOP, this is the same party that was totally cool with one of their members yelling "you lie!" at President Obama.

@KevinGallatin @TylerTeggatz @natehoodstp You're incorrect on the role of the EPA. The EPA is a "cooperating agency" on the PolyMet proposal and is the role of reviewer, not regulator. The US Forest Service and Army Corps of Engineers are the lead federal agencies. If permitted, MPCA serves as the EPA due to delegation.
@natehoodstp @KevinGallatin This is wrong. 1) The Senate has not voted on HR 3115. It's literally impossible for Franken/Klobuchar to have voted for it. 2) The "proper environmental process" includes court challenges to the value and legality of land exchanges. HR 3115 prevents legal challenges.

I mean, by this measure the water in the BWCA must be worth $72,817,653,214,288,903 https://t.co/m0sxBaBNxK

@NARNfan I see political force (backed by the violence of the state) being used to subsidize private development to grow population in an area that benefits a politician. You're cool with that?
@NARNfan Here's a good example. Basically, all sewer users will pay more to subsidize a subdivision in Kurt Daudt's district after he used his position to force Met Council to find it, despite the fact it can't pay for itself. https://t.co/KngUaurKdl

These trends were pretty obvious last election, but it is interesting to consider how much the landscape has changed in just the last four House cycles. Fewer seats in play = more money targeting smaller populations for control of #mnleg House.
Then there is the other phenomenon - rural MN "swing" districts once in play for DFL going far more red e.g. 2A (Grossel +7R), 10B (Lueck +9R), 11B (Rarick +8R), 17A (Miller +9R), 28B (Davids +5R) #mnleg
Obviously 4A isn't suburban. You could also put 25A (Liebling +8D) and 25B (Sauke +4D) into the non-metro DFL category of swing districts solidifying DFL. #mnleg
Some targeted DFL suburban "swing" districts from 2010 no longer look like swing districts e.g. 48A (Pryor +6D), 49B (Rosenthal +7D), 4A (Lien +6D), 51A (Masin +7D) 51B (Halverson +6D) 43A (Fischer +7D) 50B (Carlson +9D) 42B (Becker-Finn +9D) #mnleg
Oops, I missed the biggest mismatch - 49A (Anselmo +8D). #mnleg
It's worth a spin through @TonyAngelo's hPVI #mnleg post. Fun facts: 1) The two most conservative House districts are repped by Jim Newberger &amp; Kurt Daudt. 2) Districts w/ greatest "mismatch" between hPVI and who reps it are 42B (Jessup +5D) 4B (Marquardt +5R) 54A (Franke +4D)

@kyjlue @Jason_Buck To be clear, I don't think either statement is out of bounds.
@kyjlue @Jason_Buck One more thing - if it's true that saying "when I am governor" things responding to horrible events is out of bounds, what about this Walz statement post-Las Vegas shooting? Out of bounds too? https://t.co/8Uenib19wD
@kyjlue @Jason_Buck I don't understand why that paragraph crosses a line. It's clear we're going to disagree about this, but I am being honest when I say IDG how this is different.
@kyjlue @Jason_Buck So, why again? Seriously, is it because Otto is being presumptuous to assume she'll win? Because she proposed an actual action to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future? IDGI.
@kyjlue @Jason_Buck Okay I guess.

@sarahrlahm https://t.co/E4i24tr1zF has comparative data. Kind of bad interface, but worth the work.
Unlike Minneapolis, turnout in Duluth was down from 13 to 17 - 19,598 to 15,891.
Looking back at 1980 census docs you can REALLY see the massive demographic shift in Mpls, and exactly how segregated the city was by race.
Phillipe Cunningham's win means a black, transgender man will now represent the Victory neighborhood. Victory was 98% white in 1980.
Minneapolis turnout was WAY up in 2017. Compared to 2013, every ward in the city was WAY up. 105k voted for Mayor v. 80k in '13. Remember, '13 was a hotly contested open seat Mayor race.

Hey, check out https://t.co/zXnPsG0mnd y'all. https://t.co/zqp9hNJzgo
@TonyYarusso @TonyAngelo And there are a number of voters whose ballots were exhausted and DID rank three candidates. I don't know how many, but these voters exist.
@JustinPerpich @jkmassey In any case, there have been no 3rd party winners in Mpls council or mayor elections since RCV. Gordon doesn't count - he hasn't been challenged.
@JustinPerpich @jkmassey I hadn't thought much about that for muni elections, but I think it makes sense. More challenging to implement for multi-seat races, tho. What's a majority?
@JustinPerpich @jkmassey Hmm. For me, the biggest change is elimination of primary in RCV. It has a variety of impacts. Whether good or bad for 3rd party? So far, it doesn't seem to make much difference. Then again, Mpls is a pretty unique circumstance.
Now with Cunningham, that makes 2 council elections where 1st choice leader was passed after runoffs reallocated votes. Interesting - it took three elections to get one example, now we have two.

@JustinPerpich @jkmassey Generally speaking, I'm suspicious of over claimed benefits AND suspicious of exaggerated detriments from RCV.
@JustinPerpich @jkmassey I do agree with 50+1, but the other stuff is really hard to know
@JustinPerpich @jkmassey I don't agree with this, either. It's impossible to counterfactually unwind this election and project what would have happened.
@andrewulasich @jkmassey True - proving any counter-factual is impossible. Nonetheless, it's a fact that she led after 1st choice votes and that reallocation of 2nd/3rd choices was dispositive. And to my knowledge, this is the 1st time that's happened in Mpls.
@jeremyschroeder Congrats!
@jkmassey Voters can rank three in Mpls. Exhausted ballots are not just "bullet ballots," they include people who ranked as far as they could.
RT @ryanstrack: Congrats, Council Member-elect, @jeremyschroeder!
@jkmassey This feels like a semantic game to me.
@jkmassey Jentzen was 1st candidate in Mpls history to lead after 1st choice ballot but lose after reallocation. And from a 3rd party. Despite 3 elections, no 3rd party candidate has won election to Mpls council.
@jkmassey Huh? https://t.co/BBjXRISBd6
@MplsCougar There are no votes left to reallocate, except for those that Dehn has.
So, RCV. Talking point #1: Ensures winner gets a majority. No - Frey wins with less than 50%. #2: Helps third parties. No - Ask Ginger Jantzen about that. #3: Stops negative campaigning. No - Ask anybody with a mailbox in Mpls about that.
