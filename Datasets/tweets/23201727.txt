Tackling this issue means ensuring the success of our kids, our families and our economy.
We need to elect more women because when women have a seat at the table, different issues land at the top of the priority list, like the growing cost of high-quality child care. Moms make up nearly 2/3 of women in the workforce and child care is comparable to a month’s rent.
Thrilled to team up with @LoisFrankel, @joycebeatty, @JuliaBrownley, @CheriBustos,  @AnnMcLaneKuster, &amp; Rep Lucille Roybal-Allard to elect more Democratic women to Congress this November. #flipthehouse #ElectDemocraticWomen https://t.co/UR7WJ3BygF
