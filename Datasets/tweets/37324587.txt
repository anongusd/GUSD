The rule change is proposed and is now in the Public Comment period. You can fight the left and save billions of taxpayer dollars by making your voice heard here. #PublicCharge 		https://t.co/dKZUyvKnco
Remember 63% of non-citizen households receive welfare. It's time to stop those who will end up using taxpayer funds from entering.		https://t.co/dGfMfj5sM9
Here's a great article by @JessicaV_CIS explaining this even further.		https://t.co/1whHALe9SU
Here's the official proposal https://t.co/C76pmubws4
Refugees and asylees would be exempt from this rule. It would not apply to citizenship applications. This means anyone who applies for a green card or visa could be denied if they are on Medicaid, Food Stamps, SNAP or Section 8 housing benefits. https://t.co/BiMfdpxSK7
The rule would also make  aliens who receive or are likely to receive designated public benefits above the designated threshold generally ineligible for change of status. The rule would apply to visas to enter the country and those who apply for green card
So what is the #PublicCharge ? The proposed rule would change the standard DHS uses when determining whether an alien is likely to become a “public charge,”  is therefore inadmissible and ineligible for adjustment of status or admission into the United States

Translation : this decree prohibited Republicans from legally challenging or even observing ballot security measures in predominately minority districts. Even though the case was filed in New Jersey the consent decree applied nationally.
directed	toward districts that have a substantial proportion of racial or ethnic	populations shall be considered relevant evidence of the existence	of such a factor and purpose[

Including  refrain from undertaking any ballot security activities in polling	places or election districts where the racial or ethnic composition of	such districts is a factor in the decision to conduct,
In 1982 the Republican Party settled a lawsuit by the Democratic party by signing a Consent Decree. In typical wimpy Republican fashion, the Decree essentially prohibited them from challenging any ballot security measures		https://t.co/leq7v0xn7g
