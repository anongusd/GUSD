@photowhitehouse @PressSec @Acosta What a shame America. It is a banana republic now. How can a country go so low right in front of our eyes. Posterity will judge you all for destroying America. Shame
@BrookeBCNN @Yamiche @AprilDRyan @abbydphillip It‚Äôs a shame as we watch the US degrade to the lowest levels in history. This is what used to be seen in africa. Shame ! Shame! Shame!

@APCUKingdom We love him, he is our new president. Buhari time is over, let‚Äôs try someone else.
@BashirAhmaad @ProfOsinbajo Why can you focus on the things your government has done for Nigerians. Is this just too difficult to do? Is the foundation of APC based on Blames?

@bizzleosikoya @egbas Total is Fayose and the PDP members, tomorrow it will be you. Keep laughing and taking this for a joke. What a shame to see all the liberty wiped away by ignorant leaders.
@bizzleosikoya @egbas This isn‚Äôt a laughing issue. Nigeria has become a country of intimidation where security forces don‚Äôt protect but harass enemies of people in power. What a shame
