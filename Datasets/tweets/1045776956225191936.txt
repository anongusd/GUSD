7. I recently had upclose &amp; personal experience w/ that sort of manipulation by ID thieves when a cell phn carrier admitted to me over phn they could not tell which person was imposter on audio. They told me take phn to store in person. Thus admitting to a hacker on phn. Gloria
6. That capability of #AI #artificialintelligence is going to make all videos / audios suspicious bc how would any viewer know if actual person created them or imposter who altered his voice to sound like them using AI? Digital files are all hackable. Always. In person only safe?
5. Those sort of "edits" are now possible bc of #artificialintelligence according to article today in Technology Review that I included a quote from. Editing videotapes was possible before but creating fake @realDonaldTrump voice speaking wasn't. Or fake voices of anybody. Gloria
4. Can u viewers visualize whatbI meant? Suppose a legit video of e.g. @POTUS was altered by removing actual words. Then words spoken by imposter who "modulated" his voice to sound like @realDonaldTrump were super- imposed on images but imposter gave command to bomb a country?
4. The other obvious use of #AI manipulation of audio/ video is to create imposter videos of #celebrities, #candidates for federal office, to make money by selling them, or to blackmail,or in some way ruin candidate. I cannot thnk any legit reason for fake voices superimposed. G
3. I know for certain there is already one very large so called "charitable" foundation that uses patient info for their  own purposes &amp; records patients'voices speaking certain words as part of "test" --words that could be used to assess tel accts.
2. My guess is the motive in using #AI to "modulate" actual voices is to use it to trick #bankingindustry who record their customers' voices as part of security info for accounts.  The point is now all have to remember that what u see or hear on video / audio may be imposters.

3. Another false doctrine is that people can be "prayed out of purgatory" or bought out of it. JESUS said in Revelations 21:27kjv "there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie; ...
2. Another false doctrine I have heard is the idea that GOD loves all equally. That is not true. GOD HATES SIN AGAINST HIM &amp; turns away from those who sin &amp; refuse to repent. In Matthew 25:41KJV JESUS tells the wicked to depart into "everlasting fire prepared for the devil &amp; his"
Some #Christians say a lot of false doctrine. The idea that GOD has no standards/laws/commandments after JESUS is false doctrine because John 14:15kjv is written,"if ye love Me,keep My commandments.". Gloria

@elonmusk 3. Elon. Here's the changes u &amp; @Tesla have already brought about: 1) you have forced every car maker in world to create an #EV. 2) you have dotted the landscape w/ #superchargers that can rejuice Tesla in comparable time to gas fill up thus taking away that obstacle. And
@elonmusk 2. The competition from #fossilfuel vehicles will diminish over time since the #climatechange folks are demanding it. So @Tesla trajectory is linear straight up. It can't fail if it can compete price wise. So just keep on keeping on Elon til you have a model that most can afford
@elonmusk It's #economics isn't it? In the initial #innovation of any #technology or product the cost to get it to market is HIGH. But as techniques are practiced &amp; it's debugged you get economies of scale. So @Tesla has to keep itself afloat financially until they perfect all aspects. G
