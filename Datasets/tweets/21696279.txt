@Jim_Jordan He went on to deliver an unhinged rant about Tom Steyer?
Here goes raving maniac @Jim_Jordan pretending to be outraged that Cohen lied to Congress. What Jordan is saying is that Cohen’s efforts to help Trump cover up Trump Tower Moscow make him untrustworthy. Jordan is a Trump ally.
Cummings opens up the aspects of the Russia scandal that Cohen touched upon in his prepared statement to questions from the committee. Good.
Cummings should establish a rule that male committee members must wear sport coats at all times while on the dais, just to fuck with Jim Jordan.
Obviously their sudden concern for truthfulness is a complete fucking joke–they support and are covering for Trump.		But when they try to discredit Cohen by citing his lies to Congress, they are confirming that Trump lied about Trump Tower Moscow, and did so egregiously.
You will hear A LOT from Republicans today about how Cohen can't be trusted because he's a convicted liar.		Remember, the lie Cohen got caught telling Congress is that TRUMP's repeated lies to the American people were not actually lies.

His incentives are much different now than they were when he was in Trump's good graces, and that's on top of the fact that he brought documentation and included many admissions against interests here. It's an extremely damning prepared statement.
Maybe he'd be a bad witness at trial but in this setting he has little to gain and much to lose from perjuring himself. And many of these claims are checkable. .
Cohen's a crook and a liar, but when he lied to Congress he believed he was protected by the pardon. If he gets caught lying again now it just makes his terrible situation worse.
I think some folks who want to get caught taking the White House's laughable spin at face value have overcorrected in their assessments of Cohen's credibility.
It's abundantly clear–and Cohen confirms–that the campaign knew the score with Russia. Cohen later transmitted a "peace plan" for Ukraine to Flynn. He can't cram all that into no "direct" evidence of collusion without further elaboration.
Maybe the ground rules are that Cohen can't testify about Russia, but this prepared statement more than cracks the door on it. He should have to answer questions that seek clarification on claims like this one. https://t.co/THw0zjwFHk

@whstancil And I say that as someone who has extremely low expectations of Democrats when it comes to meeting hardball with hardball in governing.
@whstancil I honestly think that's way too pat. No Democrat would have done what Trump just did or wants it to become the norm, but politics WILL change if the Supreme Court hands down a 5-4 ruling upholding it. We don't know what the world looks like on the other side of that decision.
Norms don’t work if only one of two parties feels bound by them. In that case, they aren’t norms at all.
I don't think this is the world we live in. We live in a world where the left broadly wants to stop Trump, and is reminding justices that they will be opening Pandora's box if they don't.

In other words, the Trump administration, or perhaps Trump-loyal rogue security service guys, have already committed wild privacy abuses on the order of what Bezos apparently suspects, and used the information to blackmail a reporter.

@andrewlong166 @11thHour Brian Williams very disappointed that someone made a contestable claim.
@JamieIseler @sjdemas I am less interested in what campaign tactics she chooses to deploy against bad faith attacks than in a) putting forth what's true, and b) criticizing people in my profession who fail to do so.
@JamieIseler @sjdemas Her critics allege that she only identified as native American to qualify for identity-based benefits. Here she did it on a sheet that nobody was supposed to evaluate–essentially when nobody was looking. That's strong evidence she sincerely believed what she said about herself.
This decision to take pieces of exculpatory evidence and describe them principally as 'fodder' for people who tell and believe lies is where journalists become complicit in obscuring the truth in order to promote conflict or damage someone they don't like.
It's possible to report on what the document actually shows. It's also possible to report more broadly (as the Globe did) to see if her professional story holds up (it does). The media's insistence on not evaluating and conveying what we know truthfully is revealing and damning.

@mattyglesias Isn't that exactly what you'd expect of a candidate whose main source of strength was name recognition?
@BenjySarlin @nycsouthpaw Right, and I think Harris hit on the appeal of it by reminding people how relieving it'd be never to have to deal with the bad things about private insurance again. You can't effectively run on that and on actually there'll still be lots of private insurance too.
@BenjySarlin @nycsouthpaw I honestly think there is simplicity and solidarity in a message like we all jump together once and then never again.
@nycsouthpaw Think this might be like angels dancing on the head of a pin. Because of the restrictions in Bernie's plan and its generous benefit scheme, the niche for private plans would be miniscule and wouldn't resemble what we think of today as private health insurance at all.

Howard Schultz sees it differently, and honestly it makes me very mad.
Their inheritance shouldn't be a fortune or chicken scratch depending on their parents' luck and longevity. It should be a better, more just country for each new cohort, every time.
We shouldn't ask each generation to rebuild the country anew. We shouldn't ask young people to fight for the rights and privileges their parents and grandparents secured for themselves all over again.
The top tax rate in the country that provided Howard Schultz the opportunity to become one of the richest men in the world was 91 percent when he was a child, and 70 percent when he founded his company. Simply un-American. His favorite Dem president, FDR, would not have approved.
Political reporters will still browbeat Sanders about paying for things, meanwhile, Republicans want to repeal the estate tax outright, and nobody harangues them about "feasibility" or whatever. https://t.co/xfMIRaKZdf

The notion that Schultz's overriding goal is to obliterate the path to a progressive answer to Trumpism isn't wild-eyed paranoia. As @ThePlumLineGS notes, it's the game plan his advisers have laid out explicitly. https://t.co/8slwk1Z0eH

Sure, maybe Northam was the victim of an obvious, easily detectable smear, and yes, the people who smeared him might have a track record of playing dirty pool, but if you didn't freak out at him anyhow you're likely biased.
I seriously don't get this. If you noticed that Northam was the victim of a smear, but also noticed that the boys in MAGA hats were being racist tools, your bias is showing? To the contrary, if you noticed both things, you've got a decent handle on what's real. https://t.co/flK46VUNN7

By winning the fight over the coverage guarantee, but situating the guarantee in  a patchwork health system, making it vulnerable to GOP sabotage, ACA leaves today's Dems very little space to run on non-single payer plans. And in a crowded field, most are going to swing left.

Until they drop that demand, it’s just a trap that would allow Republicans to let appropriations lapse, and then sit back as sequestration gutted programs for the poor.

As long as he refuses to do either, though, mainstream news should not let him off the hook by portraying the parties as equally recalcitrant. It's not enough to note that polls show the public blames Republicans. The situation needs to be described accurately.
Trump is refusing to sign appropriations bills unless Democrats give him a unilateral concession. For the shutdown to end, he either needs to drop the demand, or meaningfully reciprocate.
Mainstream news coverage of the shutdown is regressing back into a "both sides dug in" comfort zone. This is  a disservice to news consumers and a gift to Trump.

2. But that's only to say Trump has created an enormous crisis for the entire country that might entail swift congressional action. That's the story. Maliciously leaking her itinerary to make official travel (well advised or not) too dangerous to undertake is a subplot.

As near as I can tell there's not a single issue that actually plays to Trump's absolute advantage, because most of his positions are unpopular, and even where they are not, he is malevolent in everything he does.
As the election (checks notes) two months ago demonstrated, fomenting a fake immigration crisis is a huge loser for Trump.
We should be precise about what we mean when we say Trump benefits from a major immigration controversy. That is true only relative to an alternative where we're having a national debate about health care or Michael Cohen is testifying to Congress or whatever.

Not that jail or prison is the necessary endpoint, but that as one’s support for Trump increases, propensity for crime climbs asymptotically. It’s a property of mathematics.

@DontStopBreedin it’s an unfathomably stupid argument.
And it's obviously correct.
No one argues that Jim Comey isn't actually fired, or that Trump can't pardon Roger Stone, leaving Stone safe from federal prosecution. The argument is that those official actions, while irreviewable as to Comey's and Stone's fates, might illegally obstruct investigations.
Trump's official powers include the right to fire the FBI director without cause and to pardon suspected of or guilty of federal crimes.
My official powers include the right to own a gun and a paper shredder, but I can commit crimes with either tool.
This, but also I'm still dumbfounded that Trump supporters have managed to mainstream the ridiculous view that the president can't abuse his official powers in a manner that is illegally obstructive. https://t.co/8GoX9Fnelq

@emptywheel Think Comey says that the memorialized account—that they didn’t think he was lying—is a bit garbled and is meant to convey that the agents didn’t detect any indicia of lying.
@aadamoni Pardons on pardons. Again, it's just something that's been nagging at me.
I originally assumed (and it may still be the case) that Flynn is only angling to cash in on the conspiracy theory after sentencing, but that doesn't really account for why Trump has treated him more like Manafort than like Cohen–the one top cooperator who fully betrayed him.
@aadamoni That's what I thought originally, but it doesn't really account for Trump's behavior, which has been mimicked throughout the conservative propaganda industry.
If this is right, it makes the release of the 302s yesterday additionally valuable. Flynn can pretend to believe this bad faith right wing entrapment conspiracy, but the contemporaneous notes about his interview show it to be utter bullshit.
@Brian_Boughton I don't think that's true, see Watergate, Iran Contra, but much of this conduct is specific, laid out in yesterday's Turkish agents indictments.
Consistent with this outrageous tweet from Trump this morning, encouraging Flynn to show no remorse. https://t.co/cNhGpGKfmH
Had a sinking feeling for weeks that Flynn is working an angle, not unlike Manafort.

2. After he became a cooperator, Manafort did more than just make false statements. If all he did was lie to the FBI and SCO, it'd be a bit redundant to refer to both lies and crimes. My guess is he committed other crimes while he was supposedly working to help the government.
To me this suggests: 		1. Mueller will disclose Manafort "crimes and lies" that occurred both before AND after he became a cooperator. It'll be more than a recitation of why the arrangement failed. It'll get into uncharged crimes he committed before Mueller indicted him.
Here's the key clause, emphasis added: "The government will file a detailed sentencing submission to the Probation Dept. and the Court in advance of sentencing that sets forth the nature of the defendant’s crimes AND lies, INCLUDING THOSE after signing the plea agreement herein."
Two things about the joint status report, in which Mueller cut Manafort loose, that even some close Mueller watchers have glossed over or missed.
