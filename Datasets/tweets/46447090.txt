The number of Harvard Law jokes at this Pompeo confirmation hearing is really driving home the feeling that Congress is a Body Of The People
Corker says the Pompeo hearing won't stop for a break before the 2pm vote, asks Pompeo to just flag them if he needs a rest. "Any good diplomat can outlast the people he's talking to, Senator" is the response.
The jokes keep coming at the Pompeo hearing, with Bob Dole addressing the chair: "I can't really see you, so you look good"
First Pompeo protester to get arrested inspires this exchange:		Corker: "Sen Roberts I'm sure that happens when discussing soybeans in the ag committee"	Roberts: "it may happen with the president when we talk tariffs"
AUMF markup is postponed -- the document will be released tomorrow, but the hearing has been pushed back to the week after next. Date TBD.

I went on an Olympics-inspired tear about Gershwin &amp; American classical music tonight, but just realized I wrote it all to just one trolling dude. End of thread here. https://t.co/eBw02NyHU4
@AsteadWesley (i have been having too much fun with the music rants tonight)
and you can't dismiss Gershwin as a "classical" composer bc he used elements of jazz/blues w/out also dismissing composers like Bartok, Dvorak and even Chopin. You do recall I hope how heavily they incorporated their contemporaneous folk music into their works. Like jazz was G's. https://t.co/P7njGnAqof
@Rob_Zig ...it matters that Gershwin has become, through sheer energy and listenability, an American musical export/ambassador for what the US has to contribute to classical music. That introduction actually opens the door to the Paines/Chadwicks of this world. Sneering doesn't.
@Rob_Zig a uniquely American spin on the classical idiom. Every major American orchestra plus countless international ones have seen fit to include some of his compositions into the "classical" canon, even though, as you say, it's a hybrid with jazz. And in terms of audience (ok one more)
@Rob_Zig uh, if what you want is to get into a contest of how many quality American composers can we list on command, I question why you didn't start your list with Philip Glass, Steve Reich, John Adams? The shade you throw is unnecessary. But Gershwin (and he's not the only one) puts 1/2

McConnell says Steve Bannon is "not a factor in my life. It has no impact on our ability to function," just over a week after the Alabama Senate election. Says the GOP will put an end to putting bad candidates up for office.

For McConnell, the tax bill isn't the GOP's top achievement. That still belongs to the Gorsuch vote; tax bill is a "close second."
