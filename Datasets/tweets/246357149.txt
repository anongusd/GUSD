‚ÄúI will support the Meadows resolution. It can‚Äôt hurt to ask for information, even if I would prioritize other lines of inquiry at this time. 		‚ÄúI only hope that, as this markup progresses, my Repub colleagues will allow for transparency in other matters as well. I yield back.‚Äù
then you must provide us with the exact language you intend to use, as our rules require.  I am certain that Republicans will insist on the same courtesy if the shoe is on the other foot next year.
‚ÄúRather, I make this point because I insist on transparency.  If you will not put these subpoenas to a vote, Mr. Chairman‚Äîas you promised you would, when we changed the rules last Congress to give you this authority‚Äî
‚ÄúI wrote to the Chairman last week about this error, and I ask unanimous consent to include that letter in the record now.		‚ÄúI do not make this point because I am ‚Äúblocking transparency,‚Äù as an anonymous Republican @HouseJudiciary staffer told @politico.
‚ÄúThe Chairman provided me with a draft of one subpoena on March 19, and issued a different subpoena on March 22.  According to the Parliamentarians, the differences are material and the subpoena is unenforceable.
‚Äú... a subpoena that has no greater legal force or effect than sending the Department of Justice a letter, because the Chairman did not follow the rules when he sent it.
‚ÄúI raise this point, not only to assure my colleagues that the Meadows resolution can do no harm, but also because it succinctly captures the current state of the subpoena issued in March by Chairman @RepGoodlatte...
‚ÄúRather, resolutions of inquiry, if acted upon by the House, have no greater legal force or effect than sending the Attorney General or the President a letter requesting this information.‚Äù
‚ÄúNow, as Chairman @RepGoodlatte often reminds us when we mark up resolutions of inquiry sponsored by Democratic members, ‚Äú[r]esolutions of inquiry are not subpoenas.
‚ÄúI hope that my colleagues will provide us with the same consideration when we ask for documents related to more pressing matters later today.
‚ÄúYes, this request overlaps with the Chairman‚Äôs ongoing investigation‚Äîthe Committee has asked for all of these documents already‚Äîbut I have no problem with our making the same request twice.
‚ÄúProvided that our request does not infringe on an ongoing criminal investigation, and provided that the #FISA documents requested here are treated as sensitive and classified documents, @TheJusticeDept should produce these materials.
‚ÄúThere are a number of important issues facing our Committee right now. Clinton‚Äôs emails &amp; Page‚Äôs general trustworthiness are not among them.		‚ÄúNevertheless, I will support the Meadows resolution. H. Res. 938 asks for information to which this Committee is largely entitled.
‚ÄùIt also speaks to the theory that #CarterPage was wrongly surveilled by @TheJusticeDept ‚Äîthe same Carter Page whom, it has been reported, was found more likely than not to be an agent of the Russian government four times by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
‚ÄúSo what are we to make of the Meadows resolution?		‚ÄúH. Res. 938 covers more or less the only subject matter that the Majority wants to investigate this Congress‚Äînamely, Hillary Clinton.
‚ÄúWe have turned to these resolutions as a tool to force the Committee to debate matters that #Republicans seem unwilling to debate.  Each time, the Majority (@HouseJudiciary) has rejected these basic requests for transparency along party lines.
‚ÄúBut in the era of #DonaldTrump, on each of these important issues, @HouseGOP are largely silent.  Our Majority (@HouseJudiciary) has chosen to ignore each of these problems.
‚ÄúIn the ordinary course of business, under the leadership of chairmen of either party, none of these resolutions would have been necessary.  Long before it would have come to this, we would have conducted oversight of the Administration and held hearings on each of these topics.
‚ÄúAnd we have asked for evidence to back up the President‚Äôs assertion‚Äîstill a total lie, as far as we can tell‚Äîthat President Obama was a ‚Äúbad/sick man‚Äù who ‚Äúwiretapped‚Äù Trump Tower.
‚ÄúWe have asked for information about the firing of #JamesComey‚Äîparticularly after President @realDonaldTrump told us he fired the Director because of ‚Äúthis Russia thing with Trump and Russia.‚Äù

"In opposing #HR4712, I do not oppose, in any way, proper medical treatment for newborn infants, whatever the circumstances of their birth. 		But determining the proper treatment is for medical professionals to decide, not politicians in Congress.
"Let me say at the outset of this debate, very clearly: It has always been the law that health care providers cannot deliberately harm newborn infants, and that they must exercise reasonable care in their treatment of such infants.
"What it would do, however, is directly interfere with a doctor‚Äôs medical judgement and dictate a medical standard of care that may not be appropriate in all circumstances, which could, in fact, put infants‚Äô lives at greater risk. #PatientsOverPolitics
"Despite what its supporters would have us believe, this legislation would do nothing to enhance protections, or the quality of health care, if an infant is born after an attempted abortion.

Opposing his nomination is crucial to stopping the rollback on civil rights being pursued by this administration.
Not only has he built his career on enabling discrimination and voter suppression, #Trump seeks to give him a seat and denied President Obama‚Äôs African-American woman nominees due to a discriminatory nomination process in the Senate.
The nomination of #ThomasFarr for the U.S. District Court in North Carolina is illustrative of how #Republicans have manipulated the judicial nominations process to attack #civilrights.
After experiencing the chaos visited by similarly hostile nominees under the Bush ‚Äò43 administration, the nation - and Civil Rights Division - should be spared a repeat of that hazard under #Dreiband.
#Dreiband lacks experience in virtually every key enforcement priority of the Division. In areas where has even the most limited experience, he has represented interests hostile to civil rights.
The nomination of an inexperienced and unprepared #EricDreiband to lead the Civil Rights Division of @TheJusticeDept is a further signal that the @realDonaldTrump administration has no regard for the protection of #civilrights.

The Committee is in recess while the House votes. We will return shortly. 		While you wait, catch up on the conversation on Facebook: https://t.co/nTCT5H3S5o #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepSchneider: Will you commit to answering our letter on this issue?		DAG #Rosenstein: If the AG committed it, I will make sure it happens.  I‚Äôm sure your letter is in the  queue. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepSchneider: That meeting, did it occur before/after Mr. #Sessions appear here?		#Rosenstein: I don‚Äôt remember the date. I don‚Äôt think there any discrepancy in testimony. 		#RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepSchneider: Have there been any specific actions by the AG to protect our elections?		#Rosenstein: Yes. We met with the @FBI.  Some of them are classified. @DHSgov also has a role. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepSchneider: Has there been a formal review of the attacks on the 2016 elections? What must we do to protect our elections next year?		DAG #Rosenstein: I believe the answer is yes. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepJayapal: Do you believe the @FBI is politically motivated?		DAG #Rosenstein: I don‚Äôt think any agency can be characterized. There may be individuals, and we address that when it arises. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepJayapal: In your role overseeing the @FBI, is the FBI‚Äôs independence at risk?		#Rosenstein: important to distinguish between characther &amp; reputation. Reputation is damnaged by every incident. Character is ab the 37000 employees. I‚Äôve been impressed w the character of the FBI
.@RepRaskin: Do criminal investigators have a right to make campaign contributions?		DAG #Rosenstein: Yes.		Raskin: Did you know of any precedent where #DOJ allowed reporters to see information relating to an ongoing investigation?		DAG: No. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepRaskin: If Members of Congress do not have standing to sue under the #emolumentsclause, when their permission is required under the constitution, what do we do about that?		DAG #Rosenstein: That is pending litigation. Department has taken its position in court.
.@RepTedLieu: And do you believe there is a legal and factual basis for Mr. #Flynn‚Äôs guilty plea?		#Rosenstein: Yes. The documents speak for themselves. We always say the defendants are presumed innocent. I am comfortable with the indictments. 		#RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepTedLieu: Do you believe there is a legal and factual basis for George #Papadopoulos guilty plea?		DAG #Rosenstein: I believe he was represented by competent defense counsel who assited him in his assessment. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepTedLieu: Do you agree that no one is above the law?		DAG #Rosenstein: Yes.		Lieu: Do you believe @FBI Director Wray can remain fair and impartial despite his political contributions to Republicans?		DAG: Yes I do. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepSwalwell: You believe Bob #Muller is a person of high integrity is that right?		#Rosenstein: Yes.		Swalwell: Is there good cause to fire Bob Mueller?		Rosenstein: Not to my knowledge. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepSwalwell: If you learned that an investigator had a political bias, would remove them or keep them on the team? And what did Mr. #Mueller do?		DAG #Rosenstein: That would be very concerning.  	#RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepSwalwell: Was AG #Sessions involved in the decision to allow reporters to review the text messages discussed earlier?		DAG #Rosenstein: Not that I‚Äôm aware of.		Swalwell: AG Sessions is recused from #Mueller‚Äôs investigation right?		DAG: Correct. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepSwalwell: Have you spoken with the President since you were appointed?		DAG #Rosenstein: Of course.		Swalwell: Have you spoken with him one on one?		DAG: Never spoken with him on a one on one setting. #RosensteinOversightHearing
Rep @davidcicilline: You would not have appointed #Mueller if you thought he was going to engage in a witch hunt?		DAG #Rosenstein: Correct.		#Cicilline: Do you believe the investigation is a witch hunt as the President says?		DAG: I don‚Äôt know what the President meant by that.
Rep @davidcicilline: @TheJusticeDept is now supporting Ohio voter purging law, were you invloved in that?		DAG #Rosenstein: I was at the DOJ at the time, but not that. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepTedDeutch: Do you believe the #SpecialCounsel has a vendetta against the President?		DAG #Rosenstein: No.  I do not. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepTedDeutch: Do you believe #SpecialCounsel investigation is an attempt to overthrow the government?		#Rosenstein: No.		Deutch: Is pursuing the rule of law undermining the duly elected President of US?		Rosenstein: No. 	#RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepTedDeutch: Do you have any reason to dispute assessment of the Intelligence Community that #Russia attempted to influence the 2016 election?		DAG #Rosenstein: No. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepGutierrez: Would it be appropriate to investigate these and other accusations of sexual misconduct by the President?		#Rosenstein: Will take submitted evidence and we will review it. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepGutierrez: In this case we have women who were made to feel powerless &amp; insignificant, who at great personal cost and risk, have come forward.		And I believe them.  I do.		Just as I believe the women who came forward to accuse Senator #AlFranken. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepGutierrez: And when the ‚Äúhim‚Äù in question is #Trump, there really should be no further discussion because, as everybody regardless of their political affiliations/partisanship can clearly see, we have a man in the presidency who has a very difficult relationship w the truth.
.@RepGutierrez: Now, I believe these women.  In fact, I would say without hesitation whenever it is a case of his word against her word, I generally give her word a lot more weight. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepGutierrez: put his hand under their clothing without permission, groped them, touched their genitalia, walked into dressing rooms unannounced to see them naked and made other unwanted sexual advances that are clear violations of law. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepGutierrez: Over the past few days ‚Äì echoing previous allegations made against the President in the past several years ‚Äì at least 16 women have come forward to say that the President of the United States felt them up, kissed them without permission,
.@RepGutierrez: I would like to ask you about #sexualassault by the President of the United States. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepJeffries: How is it possible that  @FoxNews has 10,000 text messages?		DAG #Rosenstein: I wouldn‚Äôt assume it‚Äôs true just because it was reported.		Jeffries: DOJ investigations should be free of political investigation, correct?		DAG: Absolutely. #RosensteinOversightHearing
@RepJeffries: Is it extraordinary that you would invite reporters for a private viewing in advance?		DAG #Rosenstein: Only if its appropriate for public release. If it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs never ok to release it. There are others that are being reviewed. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepJeffries: Who authorized @TheJusticeDept to reveal private text messages by employees of the DOJ?		DAG #Rosenstein: Very important question. We are not concealling anything that is embarassing of the @FBI. #RosensteinOversightHearing
DAG #Rosenstein to @RepKarenBass: To best of my knowledge @FBI is not investigating people or peacefully protesting.  #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepKarenBass: Do you beleieve there is a political movement called Black Identity extemeis?		DAG #Rosenstein: I believe the @FBI is not about a political movement. It is if there is potential for violence.  #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepKarenBass Are you aware of the term #BlackIdentityExtremist (BIE)? Did you order to conduct the #BIE assemment?		DAG #Rosenstein: Not familiar with the report, but familiar with the issue. 		#RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepHankJohnson: Are you afraid of president trump firing you?		DAG #Rosenstein: I‚Äôm not afraid of the President firing me. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepHankJohnson: Would it be improper for @POTUS to contact you about initiating an investigation of someone?		DAG #Rosenstein: Would be improper for the President to ask me to conduct an investigation for improper reasons. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepHankJohnson: What would be your legal basis for refusing to answer questions relating to the investigation?		DAG #Rosenstein: It‚Äôs simply not appropriate. I would tell you if something is wrong.  	#RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepHankJohnson: Based on language in #SpecialCounsel, does the Special Counsel have authority to investigate any obstruction of justice?		DAG #Rosenstein: Special Counsel does have power to investigate any related to obstruciton of justice. #RosensteinOversightHearing
#Rosenstein replying to @RepCohen‚Äôs question: (#Mueller) protected this nation after 9/11.  He was so well respected. We extended his term. His experience and reputation makes him an ideal choice. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepCohen: When you chose Robert Mueller, what were your reasons for choosing him		DAG #Rosenstein: Hard to find somebody better qualified for this job.  Respected &amp; heroic public servant. Was a prosecutor &amp; went back as entry level prosecutor for homicide in DC.
.@RepCohen: Has President #Trump ever communicated with you about removing the #SpecialCounsel? 		DAG #Rosenstein: I‚Äôm not going discuss conversations with President #Trump. #RosensteinOversightHearing

.@RepZoeLofgren: Can #Mueller investigate issues that arose or may arise while doing the investigation?		#Rosenstein: Wouldn‚Äôt allow it to slip through the cracks. Special Counsel #Mueller can refer to @TheJusticeDept. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepZoeLofgren: can you give us some insight why @TheJusticeDept went back on key #VotingRights issues?		#Rosenstein: What the law means is made by a judge. New leadership of @TheJusticeDept has a different position. It‚Äôs based on a good faith analysis. Ultimately up to a judge.
RM @RepJerryNadler to #Rosenstein: 		As of now, do you see good cause to fire #Mueller?	        	@TheJusticeDept DAG #Rosenstein: No. Will follow regulations. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepJerryNadler: President @realDonaldTrump has engaged in a persistent and dangerous effort to discredit both the free press and the Department of Justice.  These are the agencies and institutions under our jurisdiction. #RosensteinOversightHearing
.@RepJerryNadler: Let me repeat that:  With all of these unresolved issues left on our docket, a week before we adjourn for the calendar year, the Majority‚Äôs highest oversight priority is #HillaryClinton‚Äôs emails and a few related text messages. #RosensteinOversightHearing
RM @RepJerryNadler: Now, with the year coming to a close, with the leadership of the Department of Justice finally before us, what do my Republican colleagues want to discuss?  #HillaryClinton‚Äôs emails.	#RosensteinOversightHearing
RM @RepJerryNadler: And we have not held a single hearing on allegations of obstruction of justice at the White House... #RosensteinOversightHearing https://t.co/qyJqH4REhg
.@RepJerryNadler: We have not once discussed the @POTUS‚Äô abuse of the pardon power. While the hurricane bore down on Houston, #Trump sidelined the Office of the Pardon Attorney to pardon a serial human rights abuser who bragged about running a concentration camp in Arizona.
.@RepJerryNadler: We haven‚Äôt lifted a finger on election security. Attorney General #Sessions told us on November 14 that he has done nothing to secure the next election from threats at home and abroad. #RosensteinOversightHearing

@realDonaldTrump We urge our @HouseGOP colleagues to join @HouseDemocrats in supporting H.R. 1503, the Statute of Liberty Values Act 2.0 (SOLVe 2.0).
@realDonaldTrump Making matters worse, the ban will weaken the US economy &amp; undermine our relationships with key partners abroad in the fight against terror.
@realDonaldTrump ...which will enable the @realDonaldTrump's Administration to disrupt and upend the lives of many thousands of innocent people.
@realDonaldTrump We are deeply disappointed in this portion of the Court‚Äôs decision...
@realDonaldTrump Candidate #Trump campaigned on a Muslim ban; the Supreme Court should have realized this Order fulfilled that pledge.
@realDonaldTrump ...the Court ignored the Order‚Äôs fundamentally discriminatory intent and effect.
@realDonaldTrump By allowing the Trump Admin to bar the entry into the US of certain travelers from Muslim-majority countries &amp; refugees w/o U.S. ties...
@realDonaldTrump The Court‚Äôs opinion fails to reflect other key ways in which the ban violates our Constitution.
