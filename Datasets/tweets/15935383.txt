For the sanctity of the judiciary, and for the health and safety of survivors across the country, Kavanaugh must step aside. It's time to begin the process again with a new nominee.
Based on Dr. Blasey Ford's testimony, Kavanaugh's behavior, and the Senate majority's refusal to order a non-partisan investigation, we demand that Brett Kavanaugh withdraw his name as a nominee to the Supreme Court immediately.
Kavanaugh's previous testimony under oath has already proven that he is not credible. Furthermore, the conduct he displayed today, losing his temper and peddling in conspiracy theories, is unbecoming of a man who seeks to sit on the highest court of the land.
Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony today was credible, fruitful, and impactful. She is one hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh is the man who sexually assaulted her when she was 15, and we believe her.

That Kavanaugh thought he knew what was best for the young woman despite her wishes is the exact type of government intrusion into abortion access that women fear. Kavanaugh was more than willing to construct even more barriers to abortion access than already exist #StopKavanaugh
Claiming that she was incapable of making personal health decisions because she was 17, Kavanaugh tried to force her to carry a pregnancy against her will despite the fact that she'd already gone before a Texas judge who'd granted a judicial bypass, or permission for an abortion.
One of the most damning moments of Kavanaugh's testimony last week came when he was asked to explain why he had attempted to block a 17-year-old immigrant being held in a government funded shelter from accessing an abortion. #StopKavanaugh #SaveRoe 	https://t.co/nGpY1gHwLS

It's not just the threat of overturning Roe, it's about gutting abortion protections with a thousand cuts. 		There have been over 400 abortion restrictions passed since 2011. They establish wait times, outlaw common procedures, require doctors to lie to their patients, and more.

In Texas, if you're a minor you have to get a judicial bypass to get an abortion w/o parental consent. The judge deemed the 17-year-old was responsible enough to make her own decision. Jane went through ever hoop she was supposed to go through &amp; Kavanaugh still tried to block her

Shortly after Kavanaugh told the Committee he had no involvement in Bush's policies on torture or warrant-less wiretapping, Washington Post reported that he had participated in legal discussions on those very policies. This goes to the heart of Kavanaugh's judgement &amp; character.
Kavanaugh's records could determine whether he lied to the Judiciary Committee in 2006 when he testified that he had no involvement in, or knowledge of, legal issues surrounding Bush's "War on Terror," including warrant-less wiretapping, inhumane detainee treatment, &amp; torture.
As staff secretary to President Bush, Kavanaugh was not a "paper pusher," but rather a central figure who would've reviewed almost every document that reached the President &amp; played a substantive role in key policy debates, including, potentially, the policy on torture after 9/11

Kavanaugh has already sought to undermine key provisions of the ACA in 2015 when he argued that employers--especially religiously affiliated ones--have a right to deny birth control insurance coverage to their employees. https://t.co/znycThanSZ https://t.co/FjLIxPXvZZ
In two separate cases, Kavanaugh‚Äôs colleagues on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the constitutionality of the ACA, but Kavanaugh refused, suggesting that he could very well meet Trump‚Äôs litmus test for overturning the healthcare law. https://t.co/XECzX3GxkS https://t.co/V9qhDiUcKN
A Trump Court with Kavanaugh on the bench could allow so many abortion restrictions that Roe would be essentially gutted. States may once again criminalize abortion, ban the procedure earlier in pregnancy, or make abortion impossible to obtain lawfully. https://t.co/XECzX3GxkS https://t.co/0YRaj91WhF

His record of rubber-stamping abortion restrictions and barriers is a dark sign as stages wage lawsuits to institute everything from 8 week bans to outlawing common procedures performed after 11 weeks.
As a judge on the Court of Appeals, Kavanaugh is bound by Roe, even though he tried to undermine its promise. If he is confirmed to the Court, he would not be bound; Kavanaugh could provide the 5th vote to overturn Roe.
In his only abortion case, Kavanaugh would have blocked a 17-year-old unaccompanied migrant being held in federal detention from obtaining an abortion, threatening to delay her procedure for weeks.
Just last year, Kavanaugh gave a speech at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in which he praised former Chief Justice William Reinquist, but noted that he had been unsuccessful in curtailing the right to abortion.
President Trump has consistently indicated that he would only appoint nominate Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade. Kavanaugh's record both on and off the bench clearly demonstrate that he passes the test.
If Roe v. Wade is overturned, male-dominated state legislatures and Congress will be able to criminalize abortion and sentence doctors, nurses, and women to jail, or worse.	https://t.co/jdBRsICHy2 https://t.co/PYhmtOy6ZB
