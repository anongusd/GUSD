My story is true! I hope you’ll watch live @FoxNews or any live sports with me and see for yourself. It’s worth watching and sharing. When I pray God tells me that he chose me to share the greatest gift of modern times! God bless you and God bless America.
Recently, I got back to trying to live a more spiritual life. I've shared my story many times but have come to realize that people either don’t believe it (even if they see it first hand) or shy away as I might if the shoe were on the other foot.
The next phenomenon is the doozy. I began to recognize that the details of my day preceded the details of local and world news events. Had I died and ended up in the Twilight zone? As the years have gone by, I’ve attempted to gain attention but never really put it all out there.
Then, I began to recognize that the things I was seeing, hearing and thinking were being repeated EVERYWHERE. I’d see a license plate that said something then hear it come out of someone’s mouth. I’d hear someone say something, turn on the TV and that’d be the first thing I heard
5 years ago I put a TV in the kitchen/Den where there was a lot going on, unlike a living room where you’d just sit and quietly watch TV. Once again, I noticed that things WE were  doing and saying were being repeated on live TV continuously  and so did the others in the room!!
21 years ago, during the 1997 Superbowl, Denver Broncos vs Green Bay Packers I was being very loud the entire game. Through out the game I noticed how the very things I was saying and doing were being repeated by Dick Enberg and his crew, over and over again.  It hasn't stopped!
I had a discussion about romaine lettuce just before this event broke. Also I've been sick as a dog since this event. More parallels to news events and specifics of my life.9 L.A. County residents sickened in outbreak linked to romaine lettuce, https://t.co/fBbbsQCmfp
