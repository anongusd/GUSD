@JParodi718 I just replied to your other tweet explaining the reasons for that, and how they were totally situational.
@JParodi718 Yes, he did, because of labor concerns that were totally valid then and now. Under the labor laws then, increased immigration would depress wages, so they need to be couple with a jobs guarantee, higher minimum wages, and stronger unions.
@JParodi718 Again, not here to defend Senator Sanders, and I would not have extended that immunity. Nonetheless, even decades prior every newspaper would characterise how aggressive he's tackled the NRA and how much he's done to tackle gun violence.
@JParodi718 He released his 2014 taxes in the middle of 2015, right after they were filed. They were totally uneventful and his disclosures as a congressman indicate that if he did release earlier ones (not any reason to do that, btw), not much new.
@MIAuniverse What? We are *giving* aid to Venezuelans. They can't afford food, vaccines, etc. And Maduro is blocking it from entering the country and killing dissidents. Colombia is doing its best to help the Venezuelans in diasapora too, and my best friend is a refugee from the regime.

@EvilCEOE Progressive taxation isn't to raise revenue, it's to redistribute wealth. And at that, Sanders proposed a 52% top marginal rate in 2015. Not to mention progressives can also raise more from corporate taxes, capital gains, etc.
@EvilCEOE Again, I'd like to clarify that age is not disqualifying. Wisdom and experience is incalculable. However, she's so old she won't run for another 6 year term when she's 91. That makes her a lame duck, that makes her unaccountable, and it's not surprising she treated kids this way
@EvilCEOE Didn't say I was discontent with Democrat inaction. Feinstein has been very active and has passed very many good policies against all odds. It's just now she's said something which is untrue, demoralizing, and insulting. She's obviously a lame duck, too, hence my age reference.
@EvilCEOE I didn't say it was her fault for the lack of passage of climate change legislation. However, I do say she's incorrect asserting the Green New Deal is too fast, which you seemed to have ignored in your five point presentation. It being goals is not relevant to mobilization time.
@admiralmpj Unless CNN, The Daily Beast, and The New York Times, who all reported what I just showed you, are suddenly right wing propaganda, I'm confident in it.
@EvilCEOE Strom Thurmond also had civil rights bills from the Stone age, but it doesn't make it good legislation. Feinstein is of the position that 12/10 years isn't enough time to mobilize. She was literally born in 1933, when we mobilized in even less time to end the Nazis.
@IreneAdlerCal I joined Twitter in 2013 which is public information. The paid Russian trolls all have new accounts, usually from the past two months, because they get purged. I am a real person in Virginia.
@admiralmpj But when I say something that's correct, it is proof. Klobuchar's abuse of staff was not just a sexist perception (yes, the story does come off that way at first). Those kids told Feinstein we have 12 years &amp; she scoffed and said I have my OWN plan because that's not enough time. https://t.co/fdqJd2wDfY
@admiralmpj Why? I proved the criticism of Feinstein and Klobuchar were for serious reasons. There was absolutely no critical coverage of Harris or Gillibrand eating their chicken. There was, however, coverage over Booker...

Trump donates his $400k annually paycheck and embezzles millions annually in taxpayer dollars. See, when you elect landed gentry, they act accordingly.

@EricCraver83 @RJoySanchez @Reneraven5 @GovernorVA Abortion is defined as as termination of a pregnancy, meaning before birth, not before viability, though the ethics are different.
@Reneraven5 @RJoySanchez @EricCraver83 @GovernorVA Your argument that our morality evolves is extremely rich coming from someone who opposes abortion. We used to be extremely opposed to it, and now we are more enlightened and allow it.
@ac1a_zh @aiww The Venezuelan constitution clearly outlines the process for establishing an interim president, which I've explained to you. Venezuela did not elect Maduro. He has no right to govern. They did, however, elect Guaid√≥ and his party.
@JoeALaPorte @JoyfulGirl10 @tedlieu @RalphNortham Doctors will tell you that some severe fetal abnormalities or health risks don't show up until the third trimester. Obviously, abortions should be allowed then, and are. This doesn't even change that
@JoeALaPorte @JoyfulGirl10 @tedlieu @RalphNortham She's since retracted that statement and said she misspoke. Now "piss off"
@JoeALaPorte @JoyfulGirl10 @tedlieu @RalphNortham First of all, he never supported infanticide, he's an advocate for abortion rights. Second of all, I very clearly stated racism isn't justified. I was merely informing the madam why this information has suddenly come to light and the source of it.
@ac1a_zh @aiww You're clearly ignorant of the situation at Venezuela. Yes, Maduro has sent police to Guaid√≥'s home and has kidnapped him. The National Assembly declared the Presidency to be vacant since no fair elections occurred to elect a President. https://t.co/SFcQV83Db7
Take to the streets and liberate your country! https://t.co/W9MNHB8gkk
@ac1a_zh @aiww If the President and Vice President became dictators who did not hold free elections, by law, they would be ineligible to hold that office and we would declare the Speaker of the House to be President. This is the exact same mechanism used in Venezuela!
@JoyfulGirl10 @tedlieu @RalphNortham Because Governor Northam pushed for a woman's right to choose so some right wingers dug up the photo. Not that it justifies that conduct by him, but it answers your question why they suddenly found this. Btw Northam used to be a Republican.
@tedlieu @RalphNortham Hey, Lieu, he didn't make that decision. Regardless, other evidence corroborates he was exceedingly racist in the 1980s whether or not he was in the photo.
Governor Northam's plausible deniability of him being in the racist photo is very thin considering his racist nickname "coonman" in separate documents and his treatment of his own running mate, who even inplief Northam is a racist when they ran together.
@ac1a_zh @aiww Recognizing Guadi√≥ as the legitimate President exacts a peaceful coup, without military intervention. Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.
@Reneraven5 @RJoySanchez @EricCraver83 @GovernorVA By the way, if your point is to ask the medical community, they'd beg you to be pro choice. Also, they'd beg you to be pro vaccine. Their ultimate interest is the welfare of people including children especially.
@aiww It's got little to do with oil. We should overthrow them to save Venezuelans.
@Reneraven5 @EricCraver83 @GovernorVA By the way, I was only pointing out that most Virginians support gun control and most support a woman's right to choose to have an abortion. I wasn't necessarily saying my stance in that tweet, just stating political realities.
@Reneraven5 @RJoySanchez @EricCraver83 @GovernorVA Women should have the right to choose to abort, and this especially helps Black women because it's extremely more likely for them to die at birth, and a major factor for women aborting is birth being unsafe. Black women are aware it's unusually dangerous for them. (Bc of racism)
@Reneraven5 @RJoySanchez @EricCraver83 @GovernorVA My characterisation of abortion as "routine" was not to dismiss ethical issues because it's common. I meant routine as in the likelihood of serious injury is as low as a dental cleaning, that is to say, abortion is extremely safe. Giving birth isn't as safe.
@Reneraven5 @RJoySanchez @EricCraver83 @GovernorVA That picture backs up my statement that it's not exactly viable at 24, 25 weeks when half the time it's dead. Again, I said it's splitting hairs since abortions happen as soon as women are able, or when there's a medical emergency necessitating it.

@Reneraven5 @RJoySanchez @EricCraver83 @GovernorVA Also find it exceptional you say it's wanted by others. If someone wanted you to remove your left lung, does that matter? No, it doesn't. A pregnancy is extremely dangerous for women (especially of color), an abortion is as routine as a dentist's trip.
@Reneraven5 @RJoySanchez @EricCraver83 @GovernorVA Viability at 24 weeks is scarce at best even with current technology. It's very unlikely to be viable that far. No, I don't support unexceptional abortion past viability nor do pro choicers in general and 24, 25, 26 is largely splitting hairs.
@Reneraven5 @RJoySanchez @EricCraver83 @GovernorVA Pro life movements are inextricably linked to anti birth control movements if you want to throw that red herring out there. And besides, abortions are either for unwanted pregnancies or for health reasons/ severe fetal abnormality.
@Reneraven5 @EricCraver83 @GovernorVA I support women having the right to choose to have an abortion. Roe established that right to be essentially unlimited before viability and after to de facto be limited to exceptional cases, which is precisely the law I wish for.

@DeniseGBarwick1 I'm talking about the necessary extra ten years in Appeals Courts that you have to drag victims to. Furthermore, you should choose criminal justice policy based on what works to make the world a better place, not what satisfies murderous urges.
@DeniseGBarwick1 Most murderers won't strike again after serving half their adult life. Same with rapists, ~85% since prison is meant to be rehabilative, after all. And by the way, families of victims overwhelmingly oppose the death penalty, especially because of the necessary complexity.
@DeniseGBarwick1 But, it doesn't. Maximizing sentences to thirty years reduces recidivism for all crime, plus since the death penalty increases crime, it doesn't protect you from murderers since it generates more to begin with. Also, nobody is beyond reform.
@DeniseGBarwick1 No, you don't, because murder still exists. And because Virginia is a death penalty state, you're much more likely to be murdered because people believe murder is justifiable if their government permits execution. https://t.co/WkjZRRsvMl
@DeniseGBarwick1 SCOTUS in 1972, Furman v Georgia, determined the death penalty is dished out so racist it cannot possibly be constitutional, and so banned it nationwide. That's besides all the modern studies should that for the same crime, its dished out disproportionately to Black people still.
@DeniseGBarwick1 Execution is ineffective in reducing violent crime (it actually increases it), is extremely expensive, very inaccurate, racially biased, and fundamentally execution is killing someone who is defenseless, and therefore harmless.

Sitting Presidents and other civil officers. So yes, Reagan &amp; Bush Sr breached the greatest check on government power with Iran-Contra pardons. If Trump truly pursued justice, he would uphold these checks, not try to bury them.
The Founding Fathers explicitly wrote in the Constitution about how to indict sitting Presidents on crimes by impeachment. Government indemnity, they knew, was the ultimate definition of tyranny. Trump has asserted he has the power to indemnify himself. This is a tyrant.

@Dktr_Sus @AkbarSAhmed I don't understand how upgrading the American frontier "militarizing" Hawaiin society. Militarization, is say, giving police assault rifles. What the article described was military bases getting new equipment and defenses.

@TulsiGabbard But why did you take an anti refugee stance and vote in such a way?
@Dktr_Sus @AkbarSAhmed First of all, that's just a drone. Second, she isn't actually involved with the administration of Hawaii, she's a US Congresswoman.

@NLBlough @NateSilver538 Gerrymandering still doesn't change the House popular vote, it only ignores it when allocating seats...
@NLBlough @NateSilver538 I wasn't talking about projections, I was talking about how he performed versus fundamentals like state partisanship. Fivethirtyeight actually projected he'd win with fundamentals alone, but the polls showed him trailing by a lot more 	https://t.co/d3yWWbcvG9
@NLBlough @NateSilver538 Yeah, but the House popular vote is the best way to measure party strength in a state because you have several candidates to iron out an anomaly like that Nazi in Illinois.
@NLBlough @NateSilver538 He did do better than the polls, but not by that much. Two is pretty standard. Plus, there was a dearth of polls near the end of the race in Texas because reasons.
@NLBlough @NateSilver538 No, because all of them added together erases gerrymandering. Democrats lost the House popular vote in Texas less than they lost the Senate race in Texas. Below is fivethirtyeight which uses polls, and they expected he'd lose by 4.9. He lost by 2.6. https://t.co/seecSYNZ9g
@NLBlough @NateSilver538 O'Rourke didn't outperform his polls ...? The results of all the votes cast in Texas for the House was R+2 and O'Rourke lost by three points, so he slightly underperformed the rest of Texas Democrats.
@NLBlough @NateSilver538 Ah, good point. Castro might need the attention and he could be a better candidate than O'Rourke (who actually underperformed slightly, perhaps due to his DUI)
@NLBlough @NateSilver538 Y not? Gardner is vulnerable in a blue state. Forgive me, but I'm not from Colorado or the west.

@FFzrless @HuffPostPol She's right. And yet, still doesn't show her advocating for "Venezuela"
@FFzrless @HuffPostPol You've yet to provide evidence she is. You said high taxes and I proved the taxation is just what we had quite recently, and it was very effective!
@FFzrless @HuffPostPol No, *Ocasio-Cortez says we should have a 70% top marginal tax rate, which again, is what we had before Ronald Reagan caused inequality to explode and the economy to suffer.
@FFzrless @HuffPostPol Except an equal taxation on higher income people disproportionately lowers the living standards of the lower income people, so taxes are higher on wealthier individuals. That's common sense.
@FFzrless @HuffPostPol I saw the video a while ago, actually. And yes, watch it, it is evidence for how the Cold War ended and debunks the "military budget explosion" argument. The Soviet Union died because communism made their economy implode when transitioning back.
@FFzrless @HuffPostPol That's not how the Cold War ended, buddy. Here's a historian who breaks it down simply enough for school children.https://t.co/AX6CiUL7So
@FFzrless @HuffPostPol It's not punitive if they're still making 30x more than their average worker in a social democracy like 1960s USA. Currently, they make 300x more than their average worker because Republicans dismantled our tax system.
@FFzrless @HuffPostPol The United States was a social democracy for the vast majority of the Cold War. By the time Reagan took over, the Soviet Union was already imminently collapsing, and if anything, his foreign policy forestalled its collapse.
@FFzrless @HuffPostPol Extreme inequality undermines meritocracy, which is exactly why we need social democracy, to bring back meritocracy.
@FFzrless @HuffPostPol What I *did* say was explicit endorsement of social democracy. A generous welfare state which vigorously reduces inequality, like we had fifty years ago...
@FFzrless @HuffPostPol The Reagan tax cuts decreased growth. They created a recession near the end of Reagan's tenure, which Bush had to clean up, by raising taxes, among other things. https://t.co/vQibCKZw5e
@FFzrless @HuffPostPol I hate capitalism too. Everybody does. It caused the guilded age and we're at comparable inequality to 1929 now. We need a social democracy to fix it, the kind we had decades ago, the kind AOC has carefully outlined.
@FFzrless @HuffPostPol No, because 70% marginal tax rate isn't massive enough to do what you just described, nor is 90%.
@FFzrless @HuffPostPol That 70% taxation rate was what we had until 1981. Ergo, it wasn't "socialism" unless your definition is so watered down that it includes the post war economic miracle in the United States.
@FFzrless @HuffPostPol Pretty sure America was not a communist dystopia before 1981.
@gardenangel78 I don't. I agree that it sets a bad precedent, but Democrats *should* and *do* set better precedents. George Washington set the bar very high, and we need a strong progressive Democrat to raise it back up to the Washington standard of rule of law.
@IlhanMN But just as rapey
We need to vote out Bitch McConnell and any of the Republicans disobeying the overwhelming majority of voters, who don't want this recklessness. (NPR) https://t.co/XxX7NcQ4F7

@gardenangel78 Hell no. The President should never contradict a law passed by Congress.

RT @LindseyGrahamSC: If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed.......and we will deserve it.

@DeniseGBarwick1 @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump No, Clinton (or Ford, or Busy, or Obama) never invoked the Emergency Powers Act to contradict Congress, which is the objection I made, not that there's a lapse in government funding.

@PoliDiceTweets Problem is is that virtually nobody when polled knew who he was back then. I pretty much agree we can't say it's a cakewalk, but you seem dead set on thinking it will be nearly a tie again when no evidence says that it will be like that again
@PoliDiceTweets You didn't show 4 months before, you showed 16 months before. And again, we didn't know the candidate for either party in May 2015. We do know the Republican nominee already.
@PoliDiceTweets Because some of those were before we knew she'd be the nominee or who the Republican nominee was, and for that matter before the debates, primaries, and primary debates. Way to goalpost shift...
@PoliDiceTweets 19 is an outlier. The RCP average was 3.2 and it was less than an average polling error off. And yeah, fivethirtyeight said ~30% for Trump which was scientific and based on evidence. Nate Silver pointed out the 2% figure as being dangerous and unscientific
@NoShamePolitics @PoliDiceTweets But it wasn't 2%. 2% and ~30% are huge effing differences
@PoliDiceTweets Fivethirtyeight put her at 60-70% which was accurate, because she was always a standard polling error away, and while she generally polled at 4 or 5 this is only a standard polling error away from her actually losing. 19 etc. Were obviously outliers
@PoliDiceTweets That very link you sent me showed she was only a few points ahead of them. And we knew ahead of time that she'd need to win by more than three points. Yes, she was somewhat more likely to win. But again, that Huffington Post 98% figure was instantly debunked as unscientific.
@PoliDiceTweets No expert gave her up to 98% to win. That number was immediately debunked as wishcasting. Considering the high turnout, especially in swing states, the idea that people got complacent in 2016 is not founded in reality. She was also never several points ahead.
@PoliDiceTweets Uh, not everyone. Maybe some people glued to TVs, but polls showed it to be the tightest race since 2000, the year of the hanging chads.
@PoliDiceTweets He wasn't unpopular in 2016. Not by much, anyway.
@PoliDiceTweets Considering a -12 approval rating, I don't see a lot of reason why it would be so difficult. Incumbency is mostly based on the reality of the candidate having been voted for before, but this doesn't really apply to Trump since he barely won the electorate to begin with.

@DeniseGBarwick1 @Hbobrow1Hbobrow Putting words in my mouth tho. The crime risk is less than the risk of dying from accident and suicide because of a gun in your house. It's not as if guns are the only option to defend yourself. Pepper spray, for example, saves you a manslaughter charge at least.
@DeniseGBarwick1 @Hbobrow1Hbobrow 2/2 Illinois has roughly average, that is to say extremely lax, gun laws in the United States, and has typical gun violence rates. It's not some huge outlier.
@DeniseGBarwick1 @Hbobrow1Hbobrow My grandfather and you are just two of tens of millions of Americans who irrationally believe a gun improves their safety. Accidents and suicides from gun ownership increase danger more than increase safety from crime. 1/2
@VVforDelegate @jakehirsch77 Please change Virginia to a proportional party list electoral system. This first past the post gerrymandered system is why Democrats won in a landslide in 2017 and got fewer seats.
@DeniseGBarwick1 @Hbobrow1Hbobrow With 5x population you'd expect 5x the shootings, not 1000x. The graph I showed you shows a very direct correlation between guns and gun deaths. Canada gets as many as you'd expect. So does America. As does Iceland. And America is far more lethal for it.
@DeniseGBarwick1 @Hbobrow1Hbobrow Most suicidal tendencies last less than five minutes, which is how sane people owning firearms end up killing themselves. Guns are such a fast way to commit suicide that gun ownership is the strongest risk factor for it.

@Perspective24 @MarkDavis @NateSilver538 Except...they don't. There's no such phenomenon. The only reason older people are Republicans is because they overwhelmingly lack an education.
@malavemark @MarkDavis @NateSilver538 @clairecmc It's not skipping due process. Kavanaugh attempted to rape Ford. That's a fact. We went through due process and we found that out and 50 Republicans voted for him
@malavemark @MarkDavis @NateSilver538 @clairecmc We already had damning evidence before they testified.
@Serion @NateSilver538 Well, they kind of were. The whole model shows what happens if the polls are wrong.
@malavemark @MarkDavis @NateSilver538 @clairecmc Danica Roem for example was tired of the transphobia. She ran against the biggest transphobe in the legislature and won. Now she's the first trans person ever in our legislature. Religious extremism is dying out as people learn.
@malavemark @MarkDavis @NateSilver538 @clairecmc They're not indoctrination centers. They educate people on how to be better and get better jobs. It just so happens facts make people vote Democrat because Republicans run lies and fearmongering of "others" on TV. Virginians ain't stupid
@malavemark @MarkDavis @NateSilver538 @clairecmc Uh, not really. Elaborate how it is...	Better yet, let me explain to you: Virginia is becoming bluer over time as education and demographics change. Juuuust like Texas.
@malavemark @MarkDavis @NateSilver538 @clairecmc Uh, so? Plus, you gave an example of something that was also the general wisdom here...and it's not true.
@malavemark @MarkDavis @NateSilver538 @clairecmc Hm, they said the same thing here for Virginia. Then Democrats ran on gun control in 2017, the media predicted doom, and absolutely TROUNCED Republicans. You just have a false consensus bias...

@DrooganJd @UriBlago @CNN A key part of apportionment is to apportion it to all people including non citizens. Plus non citizens have a million other things that matter for accurate measurements. The question would reduce response rates.
@UriBlago @CNN Nope,  I don't support borders either. We shouldn't refuse anyone fleeing violence. https://t.co/erpm5YoLqx
@UriBlago @DrooganJd @CNN Except we do. Even if this question is included, we still will. The problem is lower response rate because the census could be used to target these honest hard-working people.
@UriBlago @CNN I find it very funny you're willing to call me a moron when you believe a falsehood about US law.
