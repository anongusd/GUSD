@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre back on Twitter so I can reply to all your Tweets and remind everyone that you are a sexual predator. Come at me bro.
@PARISDENNARD Are you allowed to have contact without registering?
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump Aren‚Äôt you a sexual offender? I thought you got banned from Twitter. I know CNN fires you. Go away. Stay in your lane.

I‚Äôm too lazy to have a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Me: I‚Äôm not superstitious. 	Them: Wow. You‚Äôre lucky.
@RudyGiuliani Rudy: A President cannot be indicted because it takes away too much time from running the country. 	Me: You spelled *ruining wrong.
@realDonaldTrump I understand how Trump got elected. Poorly educated voters though they were voting on someone to ‚Äúruin‚Äù the country, not ‚Äúrun‚Äù it.

@TomiLahren @WattersWorld @JesseBWatters I agree. They should outlaw Toni Lahren costumes. #NoHoochies

@JasonMillerinDC I guess you are @PARISDENNARD have time to hang out sexually harassing women now. Both fired from @CNN for being deplorable scum. Good riddance. I hope you get what you deserve.
@PARISDENNARD When are you going to take @CNN off your bio. Didn‚Äôt you get fired for some sleazy sex abuse stuff @ASU?
@realDonaldTrump @TigerWoods I cannot believe #PresidentCrazyPants is supporting a menacing wife abuser who cheated on his wife. So out of character.
@AnnCoulter Great. I‚Äôm in!
@juliehdavis @realDonaldTrump #PresidentCrazyPants RTs this like it‚Äôs a good thing because he is gone deaf. They might as well be chanting ‚ÄúRape Her Up‚Äù
@DrJillStein Over 60% do want a new party, but that doesn‚Äôt equal Green Party. You‚Äôd be just anothe crappy alternative diluting our chance to fix things Trump broke.
@DrJillStein Didn‚Äôt you accept (ie steal) a bunch of money to investigate voter irregularities. Who did that payoff go to?
@DrJillStein My god, we got Trump, but we dodged a different bullet with you. You make #PresidentCrazyPants look smart.
@DrJillStein Have you been indicted yet or is Mueller waiting because the case against you will be so easy?
In America, if you have been accused of attempted rape, you probably can‚Äôt be a juror on a sexual assault case... but you CAN be the judge.
@ChuckGrassley I, too, support this demonstration of why term limits should be implemented.
@juliehdavis @realDonaldTrump The Klan used to chant K K K too. So what?
@SheriffClarke @realDonaldTrump Do you have a job or do you sit at home and Tweet all day. Maybe you are still on house arrest? Anyway, I tipped your mom an extra $5.
@AnnCoulter The same reason we cannot get Presidents under oath; #PresidentCrazyPants is obviously telling the truth.
@SheriffClarke Then let‚Äôs get the FBI to investigate her. I dare you to call for that to happen, you 2-faced partisan hack. Go ahead. Block me now.
@realDonaldTrump This is why... https://t.co/hKX9MZLIXb

@JRubinBlogger @RadioFreeTom 2018: It‚Äôs more likely the Browns finish over .500 than a woman is believed about attempted rape.
@BillOReilly Hey everyone... look! The man who was sued for millions and lost his career for sexually assaulting women is telling us what to think about the VICTIM! I guess this is a de facto Pinheads and Patriots. Bill is the former.
RT @comediocre: For those that keep making logical arguments in regard to the Kavanaugh stuff and Repugs saying that if it really happened‚Ä¶
@realDonaldTrump You are so willfully ignorant and intellectually dishonest. Even you, with your low IQ, know the answer to this.
@realDonaldTrump They were doing to decent thing in attempting to uphold the wishes of the VICTIM, as opposed to dragging her through a public spectacle on Twitter like #PresidentCrazyPants who is just trying to distract from his own looming legal woes.
@AnnCoulter Besides being a stupid reply... men of privilege often can‚Äôt understand ‚Äúwhy she didn‚Äôt just call the police 36 years ago‚Äù ...because they are used to summoning justice on demand, as opposed to fearing being re-victimized. Also, you are a feckless c*nt.
