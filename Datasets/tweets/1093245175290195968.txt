If trump were a fireman, he would set his house on fire just to put it out. https://t.co/RE070bgU49
@realDonaldTrump You're a literal piece of shit.

@ShadowverseJC Cite your source for your 90 billion in savings.  Reputable sources, not Breitbart
@ShadowverseJC @Rep_Watkins The lies?  The fake news?  The only lies and fake news being reported daily is from the president's Twitter.

@ShadowverseJC @Rep_Watkins Doesn't seem like that investigation is done quite yet.  We'll see about that.
@realDonaldTrump @Varneyco Because not every republican is dumb as rocks?
@Rep_Watkins He might be within his rights if the crisis actually existed; however, it does not.
@realDonaldTrump Are you really telling a black man how he should feel about what you're doing for PoC?
@realDonaldTrump If phones were like your other policies, we'd all be stuck back on rotary phones.  Calm down and let the EXPERTS worry about 5g and 6g.
@realDonaldTrump I'm sure tweeting at them will surely make them listen.
If you try to justify Trump's participation trophy, aka the wall, by claiming if it saves one person from a death by illegal immigrants, you better remember that same argument when it comes to guns.

If "overreach" had a picture next to it in the dictionary, it would be a picture of trump.
I don't know why it's two years later and I'm still flabbergasted by the stupid shit trump says.
@Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Yeah, you don't sound racist at all.
@realDonaldTrump Can you go one day without lying?  Just one.  24 hours.  It shouldn't be hard.
@charliekirk11 Guess those midterms really didn't give you guys any clue, did it?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Why do you always tweet such nonsense?
@RNCastaldo @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/DmySATRWHv
@thehill Ah yes, the smart thing to do is send children to the border to bud a human wall while claiming how dangerous it is.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/utAmuDttQL
@rogerwaters How do you feel about @Joy_Villa ripping off The Wall's album cover for her tacky display?
.@Joy_Villa you are aware of how Roger Water's feels about Trump, right?
So a handful of conservatives went down to the border to form a human wall...some of which were elderly and young children. Further proving that there is no emergency.
@GrantWilliams82 @DonaldJTrumpJr Oh yeah, because I can tell from this tweet and your asinine comments that it was just an isolated incident.  Right. Whatever makes you feel better, I guess?
@GrantWilliams82 @DonaldJTrumpJr It's exactly why I posted it.  That's happening here and not a word but some silly shit happens across an ocean?  OH BETTER START THE FEAR MONGERING.
@GrantWilliams82 @DonaldJTrumpJr And what does Clown Jr's post have to do with America at all?
@DonaldJTrumpJr https://t.co/w6Qtpek2PK		I'm sure this doesn't fit your narrative though.
@realDonaldTrump What you're describing isn't climate change.  What you're describing is a dunce reporting the weather via Twitter and pretending to understand what he's trying to discredit

It's disturbing how many white people are offended by POC being offended over a Black History month shoe being white.  A couple things...if you can't see what wrong w/ it, you're ignorant beyond words.  Second, you don't get to dictate what should and shouldn't offend POC.
@realDonaldTrump I'm not sure what was in your covfefe this morning but the only thing you'll be remembered for is being a terrible human being and an utter failure as a president.

Hey guys, I figured out a way to end this abortion controversy.		Ready?		Leave women alone and let their healthcare be determined by the appropriate medical professionals.
