This happy occasion brings tons of positive changes! Lower tax rates for Americans that let families keep more of their hard-earned money.
Today, Tuesday, April 17, will be the last time families have to file their taxes using the outdated, burdensome, overly-complicated tax code from 1986.
#5: Relief from Obamacare	The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repeals Obamacare‚Äôs unpopular and ineffective individual mandate. By eliminating this unfair tax, Americans will no longer be forced to buy government-mandated health insurance they don‚Äôt want.
#4: A Simpler Process	Next April will bring a lot of relief to the yearly hassle of filing taxes. The new law is designed to enable Americans to file their taxes in a simple and straightforward way.
#3: Doubling the Child Tax Credit to Help Families	The new code doubles the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $2,000 and makes it available to more families across the country dealing with the costs of raising a family.
#2: Nearly Doubled Standard Deduction	The new code will increase the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and  $24,000 for married couples ‚Äì nearly double the amounts available under the old tax code. This will protect more income from taxes.
#1: Lower Tax Rates for All Americans 	With lower tax rates, Americans in every community will be able to keep more of their hard-earned money to save or spend as they see fit. In fact, a typical family of four earning $75,000 will see a tax cut of more than $2,000.
As we bid farewell to the old tax code, here are the top five ways our new tax code, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, will benefit workers and families nationwide:

I wrote a letter to the Navy two weeks ago with @RepHartzler and over 40 Members urging them to seriously consider the ramifications of a secular-humanist chaplain not only to the essence of the Chaplain Corps but to the brave men and women in uniform serving our country. (3/3)
It would open the door to a host of so-called chaplains who represent philosophical worldviews and NOT the distinctly religious role of the Chaplain Corps. I applaud the Navy for upholding the truth. (2/3)

The American people are tired of the same old political games from Senate Dems. Their reckless filibustering forced us into a government shut down. As we've seen, this is a massive hindrance to the democratic way.
The #SchumerShutdown means 2 million members of the military will not be paid, 100,00 national guardsmen will be sent home, and 50% of the civilian workforce will be furloughed. They will all continue to protect our country, but they won't get a paycheck.
Senate Democrats ripped healthcare funding away from millions of American children over an immigration issue. DACA is not on a deadline ‚Äì but 9 million children just lost healthcare they rely on.
Current immigration programs won‚Äôt expire until March, yet, this shut down immediately impacts national security, children‚Äôs health insurance, and more, placing a, ‚ÄòClosed for Business,‚Äô sign on our federal government.
Senate Democrats stand in the way of a fully funded government and a reauthorized health insurance program for children. They‚Äôre recklessly holding national defense and other federal services hostage in an effort to force changes in immigration law on the American people.

RT @DefenseBaron: Dunford says of add'l US SOF in Iraq &amp; Syria: "Our operations will be intel driven. The enemy doesn‚Äôt respect boundaries,‚Ä¶
Rep. Forbes: "You heard the Secretary of Defense say we're at war. Who declared that war?"
Russians have a lot of influence with Assad, but they're using it in the wrong way. -Sec. Carter
Chairman: shouldn't we act now BEFORE there is an attack on NY or DC?
"We are not satisfied or complacent about where we are, and we won't be until ISIS is defeated." -Gen. Dunford
We need to improve the effectiveness of our strikes. We recognized that we were not doing everything we could.
Gen. Dunford: ISIS's success depends on its narrative.
"We are constantly looking to do more in this fight. But the world must do the same." -Sec. Carter
...as well as executioner Jihadi John, ISIS Libya leaders, and others plotting against our forces.
We are improving our capability to eliminate ISIS leadership. Since June, we have removed ISIS 2nd in command...
Special ops contribute to a "virtuous cycle": better intelligence that generates more targets.
Both countries are plagued by ISIS, but depend on different political means to achieve lasting victory.
Northern Iraq: we have cut communications between Raqqa and Mosul. Now ISIS relies on back roads monitored by troops.
Southern Syria: we are enhancing border control.
Special ops bring in unique capabilities. They help us gain ground &amp; intelligence to turn over ISIS territory.
In Northern Syria: we have equipped a coalition to fight alongside Kurdish forces, assisted by air strikes.
Sec. Carter: We are at war. 10s of 1000s of personnel are in the region. We advise and assist ground forces in Syria and Iraq.
We need a political future that will prevent the emergence of future radical groups in the Middle East. This effort requires diplomacy.
Capable local forces‚Äîonly ones who can achieve a lasting victory.
DoD is responsible for military campaign to destroy ISIS's leadership and resources.
US strategy requires leveraging all components of our nation's might: military, economic, informational. -Sec. Carter
ISIS attacks were a barbaric attack against civil action. ISIS requires and will receive a lasting defeat.
Secretary Carter: Chairman, I agree with you. We do need greater effort.
RT @HouseGOP: "The American people want a strategy put forward in how we are going to defeat ISIS." @SteveScalise
"If all we have is Western aggression, we will never win." -Rep. Smith
The only way to win this fight is through Sunni allies in the region who are willing to fight, and removing Assad from power. -Rep. Smith
White House needs to be clearer about WHAT our strategy is and HOW committed they are to it
It is not enough to contain ISIS. As long as they exist, they can launch attacks. -Rep. Smith
Rep. Smith: ISIS presents the greatest national security threat today. How do we confront that threat?
If we're going to be serious about ISIS, the Pres needs to assign the military a greater role and allow them to handle it.
1. ISIS is a significant threat 2. The US is at risk 3. We need to act against this threat.
Chairman: Americans feel consensus about three points.

Extending negotiations with #Iran is an Obama failure. Full statement here: http://t.co/EQG3xzVYjk
The Obama Administration is being duped and needs to wake up and start holding Iran accountable. #iran
The new Congress should impose new sanctions in January, as sanctions seem to be the only thing that #Iran actually responds to.
Extending the negotiations allows #Iran to continue to advance their nuclear &amp; ballistic missile programs and their support for terrorism.
The President continues to bend over backwards to work with the Iranians, while giving the cold shoulder to our allies like Israel. #iran
Extending negotiations w/out imposing new sanctions or add'l penalties on Iran shows the complete failure of Obama‚Äôs foreign policy. #iran
Here's my full statement on the resignation of SecDef Chuck Hagel: http://t.co/g0ZiHS4N22
I am doubtful that  a new SecDef will be able to change the fundamentally misguided policies emanating from the Obama White House.
Obama and his team have failed on foreign policy, have gutted the defense budget, &amp; have injected their social agenda into the military. 3/4
Unfortunately, I think any serious Secretary of Defense is going to clash with President Obama. 2/4
Even though I have disagreed with many of his policies, Chuck Hagel is an honorable man who has served during tough times. (1/3)
