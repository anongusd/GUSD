10/ Do you work in health insurance? 		@Marshall_Allen is investigating the way we pay for health care and wants to hear from you. Fill out this questionnaire: https://t.co/XB2eEzfVHy https://t.co/38isgffmrA
9/ Insurance industry officials told us the money they pay brokers is standard operating procedure, and that they always encourage brokers to match employers with the best benefits.		https://t.co/41KjUdtuY5
8/ It doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. 		Some brokers, like David Contorno, are trying to change the game by getting paid directly by employers. They say it eliminates the conflict of interest. https://t.co/41KjUdtuY5 https://t.co/1PWMv2TD4a
7/ @Marshall_Allen sent questions about bonuses to ten of the largest broker agencies ‚Äî billion dollar companies. (ahem, #NAHUCapCon2019.) 		They didn‚Äôt want to talk about it. The questions would be good for *all* employers to ask of their brokers: https://t.co/YUxkcApddI https://t.co/buQjuqbOsr
6/ Insurers also may give bonuses to brokers. Some depend on how many workers or employer groups the broker reels into the insurer, or retains. Like an airline rewards program. That might make the broker loyal to the insurer. 		#NAHUCapCon2019
5/ Commissions may be 3-5% of the total premium spend. In those cases brokers make more when workers pay more. ‚ÄúIt has been in the best interest of a broker, from a financial point of view, to keep that premium moving up,‚Äù one broker told me. 		#NAHUCapCon2019
4/ Health insurers often give lucrative commissions and bonuses ‚Äî from $100,000 payouts to a chance to bat against Mariano Rivera ‚Äî to brokers who advise employers.		It's a ‚Äúclassic conflict of interest‚Äù that drives up costs, critics say.		#NAHUCapCon2019 https://t.co/l0TWDtHudn
3/ Today, insurance brokers gather for #NAHUCapCon2019, a health reform lobbying conference in Washington D.C. 		Brokers tell me their industry is evolving in the way it handles payments from insurers.
2/ The health care industry is sucking American employers and workers dry, often through hidden side deals. @Marshall_Allen recently looked at the way insurance companies influence the brokers who advise employers. https://t.co/41KjUdtuY5 https://t.co/kfncJVf1G3

@purduepharma 6/ In response to our q‚Äôs, the company accused the state of trying to vilify it by taking snippets ‚Äúout of context.‚Äù		...but it acknowledged that it had considered acquiring the rights to sell drugs that combat addiction or reverse the effects of an overdose.
@purduepharma 5) In internal correspondence beginning in 2014, Purdue Pharma executives discussed how the sale of opioids and the treatment of opioid addiction are ‚Äúnaturally linked‚Äù and that the company should expand across ‚Äúthe pain and addiction spectrum,‚Äù the document alleges.
@purduepharma 4/ But it didn‚Äôt end there. The prev. secret sections we reviewed allege that execs considered entering the ‚Äúattractive market‚Äù of opioid addiction treatment. 		To be clear: we‚Äôre talking about treatment for addiction to the drugs they were working to sell as much of as possible.
@purduepharma 3/ For example, the part of the doc made public earlier this month revealed an email from 2001 in which Richard Sackler wrote: 		‚ÄúWe have to hammer on the abusers in every way possible, they are the culprits and the problem. They are reckless criminals.‚Äù https://t.co/cJ1EOLMs7f
@purduepharma 2/ First, some background: 		MA‚Äôs civil complaint contends that the Sackler fam (who founded @purduepharma) pushed for higher doses of OxyContin, guided efforts to mislead doctors and the public about the drug‚Äôs addictive capacity, and blamed misuse on patients.

32/ Jonathan wound up in a nearby town. 		He was doing laundry recently when he recognized two young men from Bellport. He said they aimed their fingers at him as if they were pointing a gun.		He works in construction now, hauling wood past sunset with his one good hand.
31/ The special visa and the money for Jonathan‚Äôs medical bills never materialized. 		His months of recovery put the family into debt. 		Unable to afford rent, he and his mother split up this summer to live with different relatives. 	https://t.co/YA3orrxaMq
30/ From his wrists to his scalp, Jonathan still bears the thick scars of the attack. After recovering, he found out ICE classified him as a gang member, and wants to detain him.		Neither ICE nor the Suffolk Police Department will say what evidence links Jonathan to gangs. https://t.co/WzEUh6hUs4
29/ Now a senior at Bellport High, Alfred still lives a few blocks from Gerson‚Äôs family. He keeps to himself to avoid provoking gang members. https://t.co/YA3orrxaMq https://t.co/Il8q5cF6uP
28/ After more than two years, no one else was arrested in connection to Jonathan and Alfred's attack. Gerson pleaded guilty and was given 5 years. He may be released in 2020. 		Police say they are still investigating Emilio's death.
27/ On 7/4/18, Emilio‚Äôs father went to wake him up early.		After searching the house, he went outside and found Emilio lying near the front gate. He shook him, lifted his hand and saw it was covered in blood. 		Emilio had been shot to death, his foot still in his bicycle strap. https://t.co/aYvTcoYoUj
26/ In the spring of 2018, Emilio came to the Morales brothers‚Äô house with scary news. Sitting at their kitchen table, Emilio said the gang was asking about them and Jonathan.		 ‚ÄúThey want to kill you guys, they want me to bring you to them. What do I do?‚Äù he said.
25/ Alfred stopped seeing his friends. Jonathan stayed home after dark and reduced his social circle to just the Morales brothers and a few close friends. Sometimes, a 16-year-old neighbor named Emilio Sanchez would stop by the brothers‚Äô house to share the latest gossip.
24/ He made clear that Suffolk County was no longer safe for the family. But they couldn‚Äôt afford to move. 		https://t.co/wbiuBILCVE
23/ Meanwhile, MS-13 was starting a killing spree on Long Island. Five students at another high school had been murdered, their bodies discovered soon after Jonathan woke up from his coma. Caraher gave Jonathan‚Äôs family a panic button like the one the Morales brothers had.
22/ Gerson said he asked the judge for forgiveness because a cellmate in jail said it might reduce his sentence. 		He said he does not have regrets. 		https://t.co/YA3orrxaMq https://t.co/OSadnf8QrG
21/ When we spoke with Gerson in prison, he folded his hands in his lap and spoke in a polite tone for two hours, carefully denying any role in the attack. He said he had never seen a machete. Later, he said he had known gang members but found it easy to reject their overtures. https://t.co/Wv59lKd97d
20/ In September, Jonathan was released from the hospital, and Gerson was arraigned on two counts of gang assault, each of which carried a sentence of five to 25 years. Jonathan was relieved. It couldn‚Äôt be long before the other attackers were caught as well.
19/ Jonathan could barely speak. Propped up on pillows, he shared all he knew about the MS-13 members at school. He balled his bandaged right hand in a fist around a marker and wrote out Gerson‚Äôs full name for the detective. https://t.co/E9rAzYa0zD
18/ (When we asked whether they made these commitments, Caraher and the police department declined to comment.)
17/ That night, Jonathan says, Police Detective Kevin Caraher came to speak with him and his mother. He said that if Jonathan worked with police, officials would keep him safe cover his medical bills and his family would be eligible for a special visa for crime victims.
16/ Doctors had cut off Jonathan‚Äôs hair while he lay in a coma and pulled his scalp together with more than 100 staples. 		They had reattached his severed left hand. 		His arms were in casts down to the fingertips.	https://t.co/YA3orrxaMq
15/ It was Monday, three days after the attack.		Jonathan awoke choking on the tubes in his throat. The pain hit him all at once. 		His mother ran to his side. Then a nurse, and the police officers who had been assigned to guard the door.
14/ That weekend, older strangers offered the Morales brothers rides and seemed to be following them home. 		They sensed that Alfred was right; they were the gang‚Äôs next targets.		Afraid for their lives, they went to the police station. A detective gave them a ‚Äúpanic alarm." https://t.co/OSDvFUwXAT
13/ The following afternoon, Alfred got in touch with the Morales brothers. He was in the hospital with a fractured skull and machete wounds all over his body. He said that Jonathan was in a coma, between life and death.		He said and the gang might come for the brothers next.
12/ Alfred limped out to the road, leaving a trail of blood in the dirt. He fell at the foot of a ragged lawn, where a passerby saw him gasping, with a bashed head, and called the police. 		https://t.co/YA3orrxaMq
11/ It was Gerson.
10/ As Jonathan lost consciousness, Alfred managed to get to his feet, despite deep cuts in his legs and arms. He punched one of the men, pulling down his bandanna, and saw the attacker‚Äôs face.		https://t.co/YA3orrxaMq
9/ Jonathan turned to run, but tripped after a few steps. He felt the first blows land on his back. He felt the impact but not the pain as machetes cut into him dozens of times, slicing to the bone. 		His blood spattered onto the chair, the tires and the leaves of the oak trees. https://t.co/5j3mLjkoWm
8/ The night was warm and still. The clearing in the woods was small, but someone had left a chair and tires to sit on. 		Almost as soon as Jonathan and Alfred arrived with the older man, the attack began.		https://t.co/YA3orrxaMq
7/ On the last Friday of summer vacation, Aug 19 2016, the Morales brothers hosted a barbecue. As the party broke up, an older man invited the friends to smoke pot in a nearby patch of woods. The brothers had other things to do. 		But Jonathan said he‚Äôd go, and Alfred came along. https://t.co/xO3WVBm6X7
6/ The boys went about their summers: Jonathan worked demolition, the Morales brothers also got jobs. 		Alfred went to summer school. 		Gerson was there, too. 		Alfred said Gerson would glare at him in class. When he asked why he was staring, Gerson just walked away.
5/ Gerson urged Jonathan, the Morales brothers and Alfred to join MS-13, too, for their own protection.  		But the friends already felt safe. They said no. 		They started avoiding Gerson when they saw him with his new crew.	https://t.co/YA3orrxaMq
4/ Toward the end of their junior year, Jonathan noticed Gerson was falling in with a different crowd. 		He started wearing the Nike Cortez sneakers and blue and white rosary worn by members of MS-13. 		Before long, he confirmed to them that he‚Äôd joined the gang.
3/ Jonathan introduced Gerson to his friends, including:		-the Morales brothers, from Guatemala	-Alfred, a Salvadoran-American freshman 		 Soon, Gerson was coming over to their houses after school to play video games.
2/ Jonathan came to the US from Honduras in 2013, to be with his mother on Long Island. 		Later, he remembered how lonely it had been ‚Äî so he liked to be the first to welcome new immigrant teens when they showed up to Bellport High. 		That‚Äôs how he met Gerson Saravia. https://t.co/QRLedEYxp1

In doing our tweet thread just now, we accidentally posted a tweet that wasn't linked to our thread. 		A screenshot of that deleted tweet is below, and here's the link to the tweet we corrected to include in the thread: https://t.co/BjUKAFK8s3 https://t.co/L3FmVqrcPM
@MalheurNews 18/ Have questions? Reporter @JaymeKFraser may be able to answer them. 	Send via:	-email: jayme@malheurenterprise.com	-DM
@MalheurNews 17/ Some think that Oregon more effectively protects defendants‚Äô rights because the decision on whether to release a person is made by a board, not judges who may worry about political risks of freeing people from supervision. 		The case studies we detail show pros and cons. https://t.co/hVUbjnIWNi
@MalheurNews 16/ Board members have declined repeated interview requests but said in a joint response to written questions that the 11-person agency has ‚Äúlimited resources.‚Äù https://t.co/S0XfD1032a
@MalheurNews 15/ And the board isn't sure it will ever finish its study. 		Officials say it is not their duty and other work could "take precedence." 		They say it would be unfair to measure their success based on the criminal recidivism of people they freed.
@MalheurNews 14/ The Oregon Psychiatric Security Review Board‚Äôs study was never shared w/ the public, the governor (who appoints them), the legislature (which oversees the budget) or the treatment providers.		Board says it never shared the findings because it wasn‚Äôt finished or peer reviewed.
Buildings w/ the following issues have *for years* gotten passing inspection grades from @HUDgov:		-rats &amp; roaches	-toxic mold	-peeling lead-based paint	-no heat		Passing inspection scores don‚Äôt often match the reality of renter living conditions.	https://t.co/ajCGAFmTqC
@MalheurNews 13/ Three years ago, the board wondered if people followed the law after they completed their intensive treatment. 		An internal review last year found 1/3 to 1/2 were arrested on new charges.		Here‚Äôs what the board knew when:		https://t.co/rh3DNXHvqe https://t.co/Ns5lATPzPq
12/ The board questioned the methodology and ethics of the @MalheurNews/@ProPublica analysis ‚Äî even though it paralleled what the board had already done.		https://t.co/nvysnLDcPO
11/ Longjaw asserted his innocence at trial, but was convicted in March. 		He has appealed his case (as is typical of life sentences).
10/ A few weeks after Longjaw killed again, the Oregon board freed Anthony Montwheeler. Within a month, he was charged for killing Annita Harmon, an ex-wife, &amp; David Bates, a motorist. His trial is on hold while he is treated at the Oregon State Hospital.	https://t.co/VOpi1VycoL
9/ In April of this year, we wrote about Charles Longjaw, a murderer and rapist who was found not guilty by insanity and later freed by the board, even though doctors warned he‚Äôd attack again.		He did.		https://t.co/U5a1vo3VG9
8/ About 2 years later, he was sent to prison for raping a woman who‚Äôd come by his house to give him a ride to karaoke night with friends.		Ashmus denied the rape and said he had been wrongly convicted.
7/ Ashmus started using meth again.		Seven months later, he strangled an 8-year-old girl.		He threw a toddler across the room. 		He was put on probation. https://t.co/TYx3Y97gLc
6/ Several of those freed defendants have returned to crime and violence.		Take the case of Timothy Ashmus. He was found not guilty by insanity in Dec. 2010. After 5 months, the board decided he was no longer mentally ill and freed him. https://t.co/vFEm3l4uk3
5/ Most states free people only after doctors conclude they can live on their own without posing a danger to themselves or others.		Oregon requires no such assessment when a defendant‚Äôs time is up.		It just opens the door.
4/ Oregon is 1 of 5 states that ends oversight of people found not guilty by insanity the moment they‚Äôd have completed their max prison sentence.		Without access to healthcare, housing, job counseling and a positive social network, returning to violence can be quick.
3/ How did we get here? While most states are reluctant to end oversight of people found criminally insane w/ histories of offenses, Oregon isn‚Äôt. 	It releases people found not guilty by reason of insanity from supervision &amp; treatment more quickly than nearly every other state.
2/ Here‚Äôs the first public accounting of what happens to insanity defendants after they‚Äôre free in Oregon.		We found that many return to:	-abusing drugs	-damaging property	-hurting themselves	-harming others	A few also raped or killed.		https://t.co/n1L2haSz2b
1/ More than one in three people found criminally insane in Oregon and then freed by the state were charged with new crimes within 3 years of being released. Some went on to rape and kill.		A state board knew about this issue.		It didn‚Äôt tell the public.		https://t.co/n1L2haSz2b
