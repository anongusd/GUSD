Quick impression of Sims’ book:- A few hundred pages of gleeful accounts of past infighting and a bunch of new score-settling, interrupted by a few paragraphs of contrition for the same.
Sims adds: "—to be unceremoniously abandoned by the President of the United States. I had let my personal relationship with the President blind me to the one unfailing truth that applied to anyone with whom he didn’t share a last name: we were all disposable."
Sims writes that he was blocked from a State Dept. job and tried to get Trump to overrule Kelly, et. al. Adds: It was well known that in Trump World, loyalty was mostly a one- way street. But it’s one thing to know that, another thing entirely to experience it firsthand."
Fmr WH aide Cliff Sims quotes Stephen Miller in his book: “I would be happy if not a single refugee foot ever again touched American soil,” Miller said.
Sims on his (very self-documented role in in-fighting): "The Scaramucci affair encapsulated every human flaw that I embodied during my time in the White House. I was selfish....  I was a coward...I lacked compassion."
Also in Sims' book he says he authored the Trump campaign's leaked 2016 talking points bringing up Lewinsky
Trump per former aide Cliff Sims, gives tours of his private study off the Oval Office thusly: “I’m told this is where Bill and Monica—” Trump began, stopping himself	before his sentence reached completion."

NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) — The assertion that "truth isn't truth," made by Rudy Giuliani, a personal attorney for President Donald Trump, tops a Yale Law School librarian's list of the most notable quotes of 2018.
Trump's meeting with Pelosi and Schumer was initially listed as closed press, but ultimately was opened up to the pool _ which was *great*
Schumer and Pelosi are done speaking outside the West Wing. They go back inside.
Pelosi: "He does not have the votes in the house to pass whatever his agenda is with that wall in it."
Schumer outside the White House: "This temper tantrum that he seems to throw will not get him his wall."
Pelosi-Schumer-Trump meeting already over. Schumer speaking outside WH now, says if Trump sticks to his position: "He will get no wall and he will get a shutdown"
Pelosi: “this has spiraled downwards”
This is like the time Obama spoke to  House Republicans at their policy retreat. Maybe better?
Schumer: "When the president brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana he's in real trouble."
Trump: "You can't have very good border security without the wall." Pelosi: "That's not true." calls it "a political promise"
Schumer: "Let's debate, let's debate in private."
This video is amazing
Pelosi: "The fact is you do not have the votes in the House." Trump: "I do"
Pelosi: "I don't think we should have a debate in front of the press on this"
Pelosi calls it a "Trump Shutdown" in the Oval Office.
"We may not have an agreement to day - we probably won't" Trump says
Schumer in heated on-camera Oval Office meeting with Trump: "Elections have consequences, Mr. President."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Trump decries quotes, stories in incendiary book by journalist Bob Woodward as 'frauds, a con on the public'
WASHINGTON (AP) — Special counsel Robert Mueller is willing to accept written responses from President Donald Trump regarding any potential coordination between his campaign and the Kremlin's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.
Woodward pp. 285 quotes Kelly aide Zach Fuentes on the WH COS: ""He's not a detail guy," said Fuentes, who had also been Kelly's	assistant at Homeland Security. 'Never put more than one page in	front of him.'""
Woodward pp 281: "Little Rocket Man," Trump said proudly. 'I think that may be my best ever, best nickname ever."
Woodward pp. 207 on Twitter going from 140 to 280 characters, Trump told Porter...	'It's a good thing," Trump said, "but it's a bit of a shame because I was the Ernest Hemingway of 140 characters."
On pp 206 of Woodward book: "Hicks, Porter, Gary Cohn and White House social media director Dan Scavino proposed they set up a committee" to review Trump's tweets
Woodward reports that post-Charlottesville: "That was the biggest fucking mistake I've made," the president told Porter. "You never make those concessions. You never apologize. I didn't do anything wrong in the first place. Why look weak?""
Woodward has also obtained the actual copy of draft letter from Trump that would have terminated KORUS, that he reports Cohn removed from POTUS desk
Book suggests Lindsey Graham wanted to work w/ Bannon to find a Senate replacement to @SenateMajLdr (pp 187): "We've got to find our guy who'll replace him"
In Woodward book (pp 83): "Mattis was worried about Iranian expansion. At one point he later referred to 'those idiot raghead mullahs.'"
