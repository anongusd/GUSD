To all the loyal Trump fans. Let's show our loyalty by shutting Fox News down so their ratings will fall to the ground. Fox and Friends need desperately to feel our raft.. Sheppard Smith and all others that spoke negatively about Our President.
@ChristieC733 @ColoradoGirl2A Our intelligence agencies are liars.. Stop flip flop in and choose a side Newt.
GM Twitter Family. We need to stick together by cutting Fox News Channel off. Apparently they too are apart of the Cabal as well. Our President doesn't have to clarify a damn thing.. Our intelligence agencies are to blame not our President. Cut Fox Off So They're Ratings Falls..
@T_H_E_U_S_A @AliciaTolbert45 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I second that!

Obama was a foreign spy sent to destroy the U.S.A from within. He made a complete idiot of this great land by apologizing to other nations on his apology tour. Brennan is panicking because he knows his time to pay for his crimes is near.. https://t.co/2M0v6c3qFi
