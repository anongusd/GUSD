Hollywood actors glorify gun violence in the characters they play, but then many are among the first to speak up condemning guns. The hypocrisy is incredible. 4/5
We’ve become a nation addicted to violence. Murders, shootings, sexual violence, and carnage is played out every day, every hour, in our homes, on our devices, put out there by the networks, filmmakers, cable, &amp; satellite carriers. 3/5
In the UK, guns are banned, so they use knives. Some want to ban knives, but that's kind of hard since every kitchen has a knife. If killers couldn't get knives, they would use clubs or something else. 2/5
After the tragic shooting in IL yesterday leaving 5 dead &amp; several injured, some media &amp; politicians can’t wait to beat the anti-gun drum. I can assure you that guns didn’t cause the deaths. The human heart is wicked &amp; can only be changed by God. 1/5

When Christians stand on the sidelines with their mouths closed, when we don’t go out to vote candidates who defend life into public office, evil can come in and take hold. 3/4
Vermont is considering a late-term abortion bill that would go even further than New York. It would remove all rights of the unborn &amp; establish the “fundamental right” to an abortion w/out any restrictions in their state, &amp; w/out regard to the viability of the baby. 2/4

Albany Bishop Edward Scharfenberger said to @FoxandFriends about the new abortion law, "I don't see it as something to celebrate...the kind of procedures that now are possible in New York state, we wouldn't even do to a dog or a cat...It's torture." 3/3
I call on my friend @CardinalDolan to take a moral stand. Whether it moves the governor’s calloused heart or not, it will have a great impact on not only the church in New York, but on the church worldwide.  It’s about standing for right over wrong, good over evil. 2/3

There are lessons to be learned from what happened to Nick Sandmann. He showed a lot of maturity in a very tense situation &amp; I applaud that. However, because of the media’s biases &amp; false reporting, he received physical threats &amp; death threats. 1/2 https://t.co/Q9AvdRecv4
The Word of God tells us, “In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s grace” (Ephesians 1:7). What a priceless gift He has given because of His love for us! Have you been redeemed by His blood? 3/3
However, there is good news. Death has already been conquered by the blood of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. His is the only blood that has the power to cover our sin, redeem our hearts, &amp; give us eternal life. 2/3

Bangkok is a city of over 9.5 million people—one of the most crowded cities on the planet.  And, as you can see, with some of the worst traffic! I was invited by the churches, who are united together for evangelism, to preach the Gospel here this weekend. https://t.co/dWKcnjpyXR
The true crux of the problem is that our government has largely removed God from the halls &amp; corridors of our Capitol. I would encourage Congress to come together for a prayer meeting w/@POTUS &amp; @VP &amp; call on the name of God, asking Him for His wisdom &amp; to soften hardened hearts.
Today @POTUS postponed @SpeakerPelosi’s trip using a government aircraft until the shutdown is over. I don’t think members of Congress or the President should be traveling until this crisis is resolved. They should stay in D.C. working to end the shutdown. https://t.co/hd0vy7G1Gl

President George H.W. Bush was a man of character who served our nation during war and led our nation during peace. He represented the presidency when politics in our country was more civil.
President George H.W. Bush was a man of many accomplishments, but one of the greatest was his family. Two sons served as governors and one to follow as president of our nation. Our prayers are with George, Jeb, Neil, Marvin, Doro, and the entire Bush family. https://t.co/2ApRm0xtVI
“Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.” (Psalm 124:8)

Our deepest sympathy to the family of President George H.W. Bush who passed away late Friday at the age of 94. President and Mrs. Bush were friends of my parents’ through the years. May God bring comfort to all the Bush family. https://t.co/N5OEdYCM69

The Bible says, “Why are you cast down, O my soul, and why are you in turmoil within me? Hope in God; for I shall again praise him, my salvation” (Psalm 42:5).
You can read more about how to find hope in Jesus Christ on our website: https://t.co/mqNshH6yn7
People need hope &amp; it comes from a relationship w/God through His Son, Jesus Christ. If you’ve ever thought about suicide, I want you to remember that there is always hope in Christ. God loves you &amp; can help you through. He has a plan for your life. Turn to Him today. 2/2
The suicide rate in the U.S. is up 33%, while the numbers of other leading causes of death including cancer &amp; heart disease are declining. Nearly 45,000 individuals took their own lives in 2016 &amp;, incredibly, almost 29x that number attempted suicide. 1/2 https://t.co/cQVPuDqFul

Jesus said, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” (Matthew 22:29) 3/3
Let’s think about our own neighbors who may need our help today. What if each of us didn’t wait for them to ask, but helped them when they were in a hard place or needed a hand. Maybe they just need to know someone cares. Ask God how He wants to use you as a good neighbor. 2/3

Even though science points to the truth of Scripture, they still want to give it an evolutionary spin. God created the first man and the first woman—Adam and Eve. He created the heavens and the earth, and everything in it. God’s Word is true from cover to cover! 2/2

While I’m looking forward to a great meal &amp; spending time w/family today, #Thanksgiving really isn’t about the food—it’s not even about family. Thanksgiving is meant to be about God. It’s about being grateful to our Heavenly Father for His blessings, His mercy, &amp; His salvation.
“O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.” (1 Chronicles 16:34)

While waking up far too early while traveling in a different time zone this weekend I read an article recommending 5 books that could change your life.  I know of only one book that can change your life completely, &amp; change it for eternity—it’s the Bible, the Holy Word of God.

Wash DC has become so dysfunctional, a place of wicked politics, deceipt &amp; lies. Will you join me in praying for our leaders? Pray for @POTUS @realDonaldTrump, that God would put protection around him &amp; give him wisdom. Pray for @VP @Mike_Pence, our reps in the Senate &amp; Congress.
These people responded to God’s invitation to turn from their sin and put their faith and trust in Jesus Christ. And you can do that today as well. The Bible says, “Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation” (2 Cor. 6:2). https://t.co/kKFlyjqY4b

I told a BBC reporter yesterday that I didn’t come to Blackpool to talk about religion. He was a little bit surprised. I told him I came to talk about a relationship with God through His Son, Jesus Christ.

While I have been here in Blackpool, one of the locals took me to a hangar used during World War II that they are turning into a museum of war-time memorabilia. As a pilot, it was really interesting to see a Spitfire. I appreciate them making me so welcome! https://t.co/sfTVLCRb0q

Hell is a very real place that will be the eternal destination of souls who reject the forgiveness &amp; salvation that a loving God offers us through His Son, Jesus Christ. Heaven is also a real place, prepared for those who put their faith &amp; trust in Christ. 2/3

Socialist-leaning Dems would like to see the process derailed, but the confirmation of this judge needs to move forward. Pray for Judge Kavanaugh, Mrs. Ford who is making this accusation, their families, &amp; for wisdom for Senate leadership dealing with these allegations. 4/4

Judge Kavanaugh has a stellar reputation of judicial excellence, integrity, &amp; character. Now, someone is accusing him of an incident when he was in high school. Judge Kavanaugh has made it clear: “I did not do this back in high school or at any time.” 2/4 https://t.co/M89rGbRdyi

What we did w/Jesus Christ will determine where we spend eternity. Jesus said, “I am the way, &amp; the truth, &amp; the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” There are no exceptions; there is no other way to Heaven; &amp; there's no better time than now to trust Him. 3/3
When each of us draws our last breath &amp; faces eternity, what will be important is not how well-known we were. What will matter is what we did w/Jesus Christ. Did we believe in the Son of God &amp; His death, burial, &amp; resurrection? Did we repent of our sin &amp; accept Him as Savior? 2/3
Last week, funerals were held for two very well-known people who contributed so much to our country in different ways–John McCain and Aretha Franklin. Both have been household names for years. It has been a time of grieving for their loved ones and for America. 1/3

Sin always has a cost, a consequence. God loves us and wants to protect us. His Word tells us what to do: “Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body” (1 Cor. 6:18). 3/3

These activists want everyone to believe abortion is a choice or a woman’s right—even something to celebrate. But it’s not. Abortion is murdering a child in its mother’s womb. The Bible says, “Woe to those who call evil good and good evil …” (Isaiah 5:20). 3/3

Jesus said, “Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me.” (John 14:1)
No one is exempt from the wages of sin, not even a priest. Being religious is not what delivers us from our sins. Only the Lord Jesus Christ can save us. We must forsake our sins &amp; accept by faith that what Jesus did on the cross, through His death, burial &amp; resurrection. 4/4

“Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.” (Joshua 1:9)
To everyone who has had an abortion, it is murder in God’s eyes. But I’m happy to tell you that God will forgive you, take away the shame &amp; guilt you’ve carried all these years, and save you for eternity if you turn to Him and put your faith and trust in His Son Jesus Christ. 3/3
Legalizing abortion hasn’t added anything to our country, it has only taken away &amp; cost this nation more than 60 million lives—lives precious to God. Think of the contribution they would’ve made. I believe God will judge America for allowing the murder of unborn children. 2/3

People try to find fulfillment in material things, but that doesn’t work. Some try drugs, but the drugs don’t bring them peace. Some try to find it in sex, thinking that will satisfy, but it doesn’t. Man is searching for purpose &amp; meaning &amp; only God can fill the void in our life.
As Christians we need to have an agenda—and that agenda is the Lord Jesus Christ.
Our nation is in trouble and it is because we’ve taken God out of everything. I encourage Christians across this country to vote, to run for office, and make a difference in their cities and in their states.

The Bible tells us, “And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased” (Hebrews 13:16). Have you asked God how He can use you today? https://t.co/LfzasYia4x
Rodney Smith is making a huge statement by mowing 50 yards in 50 states—for the elderly, disabled, single moms, &amp; veterans—all free of charge! God can use &amp; bless acts of kindness like this in a great way—Thank you Rodney for setting such a great example! https://t.co/UanfRaqBlx
I saw through my father @BillyGraham’s eyes what the Lord can do with a life surrendered to Him. You can read some of the lessons I learned from him in my new book, Through My Father’s Eyes. https://t.co/pl8CXXjpQB https://t.co/YtW15Y26R6

The Bible says, “A father of the fatherless, a defender of widows, is God in His holy habitation.” (Psalm 68:5)

We can’t just be a land of open borders as the progressives are demanding. We need a process for people who support our nation, its Constitution, &amp; its laws, to immigrate legally. 3/4
It is terrible to see families torn apart—it’s disgraceful. It’s even more disgraceful to see that our political leaders won’t work together in a bipartisan effort to solve this. Some just want to use the situation for their own political gain. 2/4
Immigration is a hot topic—and it should be. We are a land of immigrants. But in this country we have a system that isn’t working. We have policies that need changing. Many in the media want to portray this as @POTUS’ fault, but this predates him by decades. 1/4

That’s why I believe it’s so important for Christians run for school boards across the country—to put a stop to this kind of wicked agenda being promoted within our education system. 3/3
John loves his job, but after he prayed about it, he determined he couldn’t do this because it is wrong &amp; he believes it’s harmful to the students. 	John wants his job back—but he wants his freedom of speech too! John’s school board is meeting TONIGHT! Will you pray for him? 2/3

“Then He [Jesus] arose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, ‘Peace, be still!’ And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.” (Mark 4:39)
The Bible says, “For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures” (1 Cor. 15:3-4)
People try to be good, people try religion, success—but peace &amp; hope don't come from those things. Religion can’t save you—only a relationship w/Jesus Christ can give you the hope &amp; purpose that you need. If you know the love &amp; hope found in Christ, share it w/ others today.
There is only One who can give us the hope we need—Jesus Christ. God created each one of us, and there is a void in every life that can only be filled by a relationship with Him.
Per @WHO nearly 800,000 people take their own lives around the world every year. For each person who's successful in committing suicide, 20+ attempt it. It's an epidemic we can’t deny. The root cause? A feeling that life’s just not worth it &amp; the problems are insurmountable. 2/2

Russell said, “I believe everyone, myself included, is guilty of breaking our moral obligations to God...But by turning from our sin &amp; trusting fully in Jesus Christ, we can be forgiven...I love those who the LGBTQ community represents, &amp; want them to know Christ..." 2/3
.@CrossFit fired Russell Berger because he expressed his views about LGBTQ lifestyle being sin. When explaining his comments he said, “I use the word ‘sin’...because that’s what God’s Word calls it...I believe that God’s Word is true.” Russell's right. 1/3 https://t.co/1tNAOFnibi
Let’s pray for Kate Spade’s family, especially her 13-year-old daughter, that God would comfort her heart now and in the coming days. https://t.co/vBlcvgK5IL
Many believe that more money or success will be the answer to life’s problems. That’s just not so. Far more important than any of these things is having a relationship w/God, who created &amp; loves us. He wants to take the burdens that we face in life if we’ll just let Him. 2/2

The Bible says, “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness” (1 John 1:9).
And He commands that we repent of our sins. You have to be willing to say—“God, I’m a sinner and I’m sorry for my sin. I want to put my faith and trust in your Son, Jesus Christ. I want to believe in Him as my Savior and follow Him as my Lord.”
“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life” (John 3:16).
Jesus came to earth on a rescue mission to save us from our sins. He took our sins to the cross, died, was buried, and God raised Him to life on the third day.
I told the crowd in Santa Clara tonight about a man named Zacchaeus. When he met Jesus, it changed his life forever! Zacchaeus had a decision to make—to obey Jesus or to reject Him. We all have to make that decision.

The Lord says, “I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you” (Ezekiel 36:26).
Each one of us faces eternal death, unless we accept the gift of new life that God offers if we put our faith and trust in His Son, Jesus Christ. Every person has broken God’s laws and is in need of a spiritual heart change that only He can perform.
20-year-old Californian, Mathieu Bergeron, tragically took a fatal fall from his longboard last May. But he was an organ donor &amp; his heart went to another Californian, Dr. Murray Alsip, who would’ve died without a new heart. Mathieu gave the gift of life. https://t.co/GynJCB8hMW

The ultimate hope for America lies in Jesus Christ—not in the Republican party or the Democratic party. He is the only one who can change the human heart.
Yes Christians should definitely be involved in politics and in leadership! And every Christian should vote at every election.  We need to have Godly influence and be salt &amp; light in this world.

.@SpeakerRyan announced that he will not seek reelection. He has served our country w/integrity &amp; honor. I'm sure that he &amp; his family would appreciate our prayers during this time. 2/2 https://t.co/nNupPTBwV7

Christians need to wake up—we can have a say in the future direction of our cities, our states, and our nation if we will stay informed, pray, and vote our convictions.
This new law was voted down by a very narrow margin—but only 35% of the city’s registered voters even cast a ballot! It makes you wonder how the outcome would have been if every Christian, every church, in Anchorage, AK, had gotten behind it. https://t.co/xim1q2bmGX
A bill to stop men from using women’s bathrooms lost in the voting booth in Anchorage. The law would’ve required people to use the restrooms, dressing rooms, locker rooms that match the sex on their birth certificate. That would make sense, wouldn’t it? https://t.co/JJLEsJhRJv

Jesus said, “You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste … It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet” (Matthew 5:13).
WI just lost a seat in its state Supreme Court to a progressive judge. In my opinion, if Christians had come out to vote, this seat wouldn't have been lost. It's not the time to be silent—it's time to make positive change for our children &amp; grandchildren. https://t.co/4lV9zyO6ie
Christians should be aware of candidates who call themselves progressive. Progressive is generally just a code word for someone who leans toward socialism, who does not believe in God, &amp; who will likely vote against Godly principles that are so important to our nation. 2/2
All elections are important. Midterms are coming up, but important elections are happening across the country at other times as well. As Christians we need to pray and we need to vote, even in off-year elections. 1/2

"In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him." (1 John 4:9)
God values a soul so highly that He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to redeem our souls from an eternity in Hell.
The Son of God, Jesus Christ, took the sins of the world on Himself, died on a cross to pay the penalty for our sins, &amp; was raised from the dead to sit at the right hand of the Father. If we put our faith and trust in Him, He will forgive our sin &amp; heal the human heart.
We can have demonstrations &amp; collect every weapon in the world, but an evil heart will find a way to take life. Jesus said, “For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.” Matt. 15:19 https://t.co/QkHZovGPyN
You may find this a surprising report—Even with most guns of any kind being banned in England for many years, the murder rate in London was higher than in New York City last month. They have seen a surge in vicious stabbings. https://t.co/aINAbcgSrA

Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die…” (John 11:25-26).
Jesus Christ is the Holy Son of God who came to earth in human flesh, was crucified on a cross for our sins, died, buried, and rose to life on the third day. He is alive and reigns at the right hand of the Father in Heaven, and He’s coming back again one day.
As we celebrate Easter, let’s remember to pray for Christians who live under persecution and all those who do not have the freedom to gather and worship the risen Savior today. https://t.co/ZIlYEV5IlW
The power and significance of Christ's resurrection sent shock waves rippling throughout eternity. Nothing in all of history has so greatly impacted the world. It changed everything, and it is still sending shock waves today.
This Easter Sunday, you can listen to my father @BillyGraham preach on the victory and salvation we have in Jesus Christ on @SiriusXM Channel 145. https://t.co/BJ7G8m63qc
He’s not dead—He’s alive! Jesus Christ rose from the dead and reigns at the right hand of the Father!
“But the angel answered and said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. He is not here; for He is risen, as He said...” (Matthew 28:5-6)
Jesus Christ is God in the flesh, and He took your sins and mine to the Cross, dying in our place, so that we might live--if we would turn from our sins and put our faith in Him.
I’m looking forward to being in California May 20 - June 5 for the #DecisionAmerica California Tour. I hope you’ll join us! https://t.co/Sxp7ocx2ue
Easter is not about Easter eggs and bunny rabbits. It’s about Almighty God, the Creator of the universe, loving the world so much that He sent His one and only Son to come to earth on a rescue mission to die for our sins.
My father @BillyGraham shares that the greatest news ever heard by mortal ears is—“He is not here, He is risen!” Here’s a clip of his Easter message for Hour of Decision. There’s only one way to salvation, &amp; that’s through the death, burial, &amp; resurrection of Jesus Christ. https://t.co/PkKjrNcqlb
The Bible says, “For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit” (1 Peter 3:18)

The Bible says, “Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends” (John 15:13).
2000 years ago our Lord and Savior took it on Himself to die on a cross for my sins. I deserve to die, because I’m a sinner and I’m guilty. I deserve sin’s penalty—no ifs, ands, or buts. But Jesus Christ paid my debt in full. That’s the good news in Good Friday.
The Bible says, “And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.” (Mark 8:31)
“One-third of Matthew…one-third of Mark…one-fourth of Luke, and one-half of John are given to [Christ’s] death…Jesus came for the express purpose of dying for sinners. When He left heaven, He knew He was going to the cross.” –@BillyGraham
My mother Ruth Bell Graham said, “A happy marriage is the union of two good forgivers”—that is so true. 2/2
Sadly, most marriages that make the national news aren’t happy ones. But @CandaceCBure credits Jesus &amp; the Bible for her happy marriage of 22 years. That’s a great testimony, &amp; I’m thankful she is sharing it. 1/2 https://t.co/5Uhtgljcrm
Through the Son of God's sacrificial death on the cross, burial, and resurrection, He made it possible for mankind to have forgiveness of sins, peace with God, and eternal life with Him.
“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16)
“Because of what Jesus Christ did for us through His cross and resurrection, we know that we have hope for the future.” –Billy Graham #Easter

Many rulers during Jesus’ life &amp; the writing of Scripture were infamously cruel &amp; corrupt, including Caesar Augustus, Herod, &amp; Nero. We are to pray—not because our leaders are perfect, but because they’re imperfect. Let’s pray for our elected leaders. https://t.co/tvQBZdOGDt

At the top of @Coach_Kennedy's list for what is responsible for that is “an unswerving faith” in God. Kennedy shared that “his verse” is Job 23:10, which says, “But He knows the way that I take; When He has tested me, I shall come forth as gold.” 2/3

“If we think that a part of what we are seeing is not a cultural problem, we’re kidding ourselves.	We as a culture, as a society ... we don’t value human life like we did. We remove increasingly respect for the dignity of other people.”	-@GovMattBevin https://t.co/LiBEDHtzlz
Many people are talking about gun control &amp; school shootings—these are extremely important issues. In this video, @GovMattBevin makes great points that need to be heard in this discussion. We’re desensitized to the value &amp; dignity of human life. https://t.co/kVW8OyXA2h
The Word of God says, “Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap” (Galatians 6:7).
.@MSNBC host @SRuhle didn’t seem to like @Larry_Kudlow’s faith-based comment &amp; demeaned it on the air while her co-host laughed. God’s will isn’t a laughing matter—&amp; neither is a Christian who seeks it. https://t.co/Ed4ECqvpFA
This week the @WhiteHouse announced that @CNBC​’s @Larry_Kudlow was chosen by @POTUS @realDonaldTrump​ as top economic adviser. In his goodbye, Kudlow said, “however this thing works out, it will be God’s will.” https://t.co/rxSIHFS4po
“But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:8)

Great news! @SiriusXM will be playing my father @BillyGraham’s sermons on channel 145 from March 19 through Easter. Thank you SiriusXM! https://t.co/DgiSWoV5uo
Yesterday @VP Pence spoke w/Iraq’s PM @HaiderAlAbadi about protecting persecuted Christians &amp; other religious minorities in Iraq &amp; the Middle East. I’m deeply grateful for VP’s concern &amp; his work on behalf of persecuted Christians around the world. We're blessed to have him.
The Bible says, “For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.” (1 Corinthians 1:18)
.@UVAMensHoops Coach Bennett has said, “I have great things in my life...but when you line them up in comparison to Christ &amp; the relationship you have with Him...they don’t compare.” He's right! I’m thankful for athletes &amp; coaches who aren’t afraid to talk about their faith. 2/2
#MarchMadness kicked off today &amp; the @UVAMensHoops have fought their way to a number 1 seed with a 31-2 record. Cavaliers' Head Coach Tony Bennett is very outspoken about his commitment to Jesus Christ. 1/2 https://t.co/kSZzY5ZcLE
We need more Good Samaritans in this world. The Bible says, “Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others” (Philippians 2:4). I urge you—take time to stop and help someone today! 2/2
A driver in Georgia noticed an elderly man trying to cross a busy street, so he didn’t just drive on by. He stopped his truck, got out, &amp; helped the man get across safely. Wouldn’t it be great if helping others went as viral as this video? 1/2 https://t.co/xD9OZluV5F
The Bible says, "You alone are the Lord. You have made the heavens, The heaven of heavens with all their host, The earth and all that is on it, The seas and all that is in them. You give life to all of them And the heavenly host bows down before You” (Nehemiah 9:6).

I’m glad to hear that @JoyVBehar apologized publicly on @TheView this morning. She said, “I think Vice President Pence is right. I was raised to respect everyone’s religious faith &amp; I fell short of that. I sincerely apologize for what I said.” https://t.co/OUYR1tZsjy
At least @JoyVBehar made a private call to @VP Pence to apologize, but it's disappointing that there's still been no action taken by the network or a public apology. I think she should publicly apologize to all Christians, as should @ABC. https://t.co/YpXGmx6ScN
.@TheView's @JoyVBehar is still in the news for the anti-Christian comments she made comparing hearing from Jesus to mental illness. I'm glad @ABC News received more than 30K calls about her hateful remarks. https://t.co/Qkr9tmGCOv
God’s Word tells us that one day “at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father” (Philippians 2:10-11).
Atheism and secularism may be trendy and “progressive,” but denying God is devastating for a life or for a nation. 2/2 https://t.co/ayRRluNEWj
There’s a @USAToday story about an atheist running for office in TN. I’m shocked by her profoundly incorrect statement—she said, “It’s incidental to who I am.” The opposite is true. There’s nothing more significant to who we are &amp; nothing more important than faith in Christ. 1/2
The Word of God says, "The one who blesses others is abundantly blessed; those who help others are helped" (Proverbs 11:25).
Monique will never forget what happened at this church! She's a @Dominos delivery person &amp; got a call to deliver to the pastor—who was preaching at the time. He shocked her w/a $100 tip &amp; others responded &amp; blessed her beyond what she could imagine. https://t.co/ocraJYg0Rg
Jesus said, “Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me. In My Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.”  (John 14:1-2)
Don’t forget @FoxNews will be airing “Billy Graham: An Extraordinary Journey” tonight at 8! https://t.co/aPOBaFlX9f

While I miss them both greatly, I’m thankful to know that my father @BillyGraham and my mother are reunited once again in Heaven. https://t.co/uaS03Ikgbd
A life—or a land—without God stands bereft, in spiritual poverty. The Bible tells us, "Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord…" (Psalm 33:12).
Liberalism's socialist policies wreck an economy. Socialism has been said to be the world's greatest generator of poverty. Even more importantly, these socialist policies abandon God in favor of godless secularism. https://t.co/grVMVXrjME
.@HeyTammyBruce says that unchallenged liberalism leaves homelessness, drug abuse, and garbage in its wake. That's very true. But I would add two more consequences to her list—first, physical poverty, and second, spiritual poverty. https://t.co/fYqYzsvbHu

Why would @Facebook ask such a question? It just shows how low moral standards in this country have fallen. Many people today don't seem to recognize right from wrong. I’m sure Mark Zuckerberg &amp; Priscilla Chan were appalled. https://t.co/tVLR4tFbwA
"Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life..." (John 3:36)
“Death is said in the Bible to be a coronation for the Christian.” –@BillyGraham

Jesus said, “Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life." (John 5:24)
My father @BillyGraham said, “Death is not the end of the road—it is merely a gateway to eternal life beyond the grave.”
Did you watch “Billy Graham: An Extraordinary Journey” tonight? It was a great tribute of my father’s life and the message he preached. https://t.co/lNiFSCWHZ6
The day of my father's funeral, Washington, D.C., had damaging winds of up to 70 mph. Despite that, @POTUS, @FLOTUS, @VP, &amp; @SecondLady made the trip to NC.

If the answer is no, it is my prayer that you will turn to Jesus Christ in repentance and faith. The Bible says, “…if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved” (Romans 10:9). 2/2
I know that my father @BillyGraham is now experiencing the joys of Heaven. In the service today, I asked the question, “If this were YOUR funeral, would you be in Heaven?” That’s a question I hope everyone reading this will answer in their own hearts. 1/2 https://t.co/Ze6MKZqA3J

My father @BillyGraham said, “Death for the Christian is the doorway to heaven’s glory. Because of Christ’s resurrection we can joyously say with Paul, ‘Where, O death, is your victory?’” (1 Corinthians 15:55)
"For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal." (2 Corinthians 4:18)
"But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Corinthians 15:57).
My father said, "For the Christian, death can be faced realistically and with victory because he knows that 'neither death nor life…will be able to separate us from the love of God.'" (Romans 8:38-39) @BillyGraham
Be sure to ask @SiriusXM to keep the Billy Graham Channel after March 4 so you can continue to hear my father’s sermons. 2/2
My father @BillyGraham was a pioneer in broadcasting the message of the Gospel. That legacy continues as @SiriusXM hosts the Billy Graham Channel 145 through March 4. 1/2

"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith" (2 Timothy 4:7).
It's a great joy to think of my father experiencing Heaven. He once said, "In our resurrection bodies, we will know nothing of physical weakness. Limitations imposed on us on this earth are not known in heaven. We will have a habitation from God that is...powerful." @BillyGraham

Some referred to my father @BillyGraham as the “Pastor to Presidents.” He has known every U.S. president since Truman, &amp; had a personal friendship w/ many of them.

@seanhannity @PastorDScott Appreciate your thoughtful words @SeanHannity. They mean so much to our family.
.@BillyGraham preached about Heaven, wrote books about Heaven—now he is IN Heaven. His faith has become sight.
We put a Bible with him in the casket &amp; the casket is placed behind a pulpit. We felt this was symbolic since he stood behind a pulpit most of his life preaching the Gospel. 2/2
Yesterday my father’s body was brought from the funeral home to the @BillyGraham Training Center at @TheCoveNC. His simple plywood casket, like my mother’s, was built by convicted murderers at Angola Prison. 1/2 https://t.co/7tAvzfqEHA

My father once said, "I'm not afraid to die, for I know the joys of heaven are waiting." -@BillyGraham
My family and I are touched by the outpouring of condolences from thousands of people around the world. Thank you all.

"Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me … I go to prepare a place for you … I will come again and receive you to myself; that where I am, there you may be also." (John 14:1-3)
"Someday you will read or hear that Billy Graham is dead. Don't believe a word of it. I shall be more alive than I am now. I will just have changed my address. I will have gone into the presence of God." --@BillyGraham
“Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints” (Psalm 116:15).
My father @BillyGraham once said, “The most thrilling thing about heaven is that Jesus Christ will be there. I will see Him face to face. Jesus Christ will meet us at the end of life’s journey.”
My father @BillyGraham was once asked, “Where is Heaven?” He said, “Heaven is where Jesus is and I am going to Him soon!” This morning, he departed this world into eternal life in Heaven, prepared by the Lord Jesus Christ—the Savior of the world—whom he proclaimed for 80 years.
“Taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the one who takes refuge in him.” (Psalm 34:8)
“You’re not saved by joining a church. You’re not saved by living a good moral life. You’re saved only because of the grace of God in Christ.” Read more from my father @BillyGraham in this month’s issue of @DecisionNews: https://t.co/YjEMT9xDBJ
In only his second full season as a professional baseball player, @Mets general manager says he thinks @TimTebow will play in the major leagues. Tim is such a strong witness for Christ &amp; a positive influence—I wish him the best, whatever he does! https://t.co/xmJ0if3KOz
On this #PresidentsDay, we remember the past presidents who have served throughout our country’s history. Let’s also remember our current president. Pray for @POTUS @realDonaldTrump, that God will give him His wisdom as he leads this nation during a very turbulent time.
“America was founded by people who believed that God was their rock of safety. He is ours.” —President Ronald Reagan #PresidentsDay
My father @BillyGraham​ has met every President of the U.S. since Harry S. Truman. Watch this #PresidentsDay clip. https://t.co/8gYUI88C5M
William Byron said, "God is so important in my life. Winning a race can’t be the center of your life ... I know that my faith is center, &amp; I can rely on that all of the time." @WilliamByron keep putting God first, &amp; that'll be your biggest win in life! 3/3	https://t.co/Xv0Mg8gduf
I think @NASCAR's @WilliamByron had a fantastic answer when asked if his faith was a factor in racing—	"I feel like getting into racing was God's plan for me, so I can spread my faith through the racing garage and with race fans..." #Daytona500 2/3 https://t.co/Xv0Mg8gduf

“Oh, give thanks to the Lord!	Call upon His name; Make known His deeds among the peoples!” (Psalm 105:1)
How comforting to know that, “I call on the Lord in my distress, and he answers me” (Psalm 120:1). Call on Him now—God loves you and will help you.
Many people are hurting today, in the middle of crisis or overwhelming grief. The most important thing we can remember are the promises of Scripture. “God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble” (Psalm 46:1).
The Bible says, “... God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” (James 4:6)
Years ago, my father @BillyGraham shared some interesting findings about a survey taken of 198 world class athletes. Is athletic success and a gold medal more valuable than life itself? You’ll be shocked to hear what many answered. #Olympics https://t.co/ef8clsLxi3
I’m thankful that today God still speaks to us through His Word and through His Holy Spirit working in our lives. Aren’t you?
The Bible is full of examples of people hearing from God. Jesus said, “My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me” (John 10:27). Those who have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ know what this means. 2/2
Hearing from God may be mocked by some like @JoyVBehar, but it is nothing new and it’s definitely not mental illness as she said. 1/2
Jesus said, “The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10)
As a nation we’ve become desensitized to the value of human life. That’s also evidenced in the 60 million children whose lives have been ended through abortion in this country since 1973. My prayer is that America will wake up before it’s too late—God’s judgment is coming.
I agree w/@GovMattBevin who said that in our nation we are celebrating "a culture of death.” The graphic violence and death pushed out through video games, TV shows, movies, and music should shock us, but it doesn’t any more. https://t.co/XC3TBVIL2I
Hey Ben-Good to hear from you! Scripture says God’s Word does not return void. In my humble opinion I wouldn’t call this a reckless use of Scripture. It may be that God used this to comfort someone &amp; I’m thankful @POTUS will share from the Bible. There’s power in the Word of God! https://t.co/rMUCACmtN4

“See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.” (1 John 3:1)
I know that the families of the victims and this entire community would appreciate our continued prayers—that God would put His arms around them and comfort them. https://t.co/AXHSaRQ4M3
When @POTUS addressed the nation today about the horrific FL school massacre, he pointed to comfort from God’s Word--”In these moments of heartache &amp; darkness we hold on to God’s Word in Scripture, ‘I have heard your prayers &amp; seen your tears; I will heal you’” (2 Kings 20:5).

These #Valentines were college sweethearts--and married for nearly 64 years! My father @BillyGraham once said, “Ruth and I don’t have a perfect marriage, but we have a great one.” I’m grateful for the example they were to all of us. #ValentinesDay https://t.co/j77Sp4j7uz
I spoke with @Greta on @VOANews about the Rohingya refugee crisis. Some may be asking, why would @SamaritansPurse—a Christian organization—be helping Muslims? Because God loves all of us.

“I believe with all my heart it was faith that carried our nation to a more perfect union.”	-@VP @Mike_Pence at @NMAAHC today.
I’m thankful @VP @Mike_Pence doesn’t hesitate to talk about God &amp; the impact that faith has had in our nation’s history. Today he visited the @NMAAHC &amp; shared that he had a “profound appreciation for the role of faith in the progress that we’ve made.”	https://t.co/Fm1G8JQxGC

“For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.” (1 Corinthians 1:18)
Bermuda’s repeal of same-sex marriage took courage &amp; integrity. In the US, our votes on this didn’t count—it was decided by liberal judges &amp; SCOTUS. 5 unelected justices overruled the people in 31 states who voted to define marriage by God’s design. https://t.co/Cfg7qahL3p
Bermuda becomes the first jurisdiction in the world to repeal same-sex marriage. The act passed Bermuda's House and Senate by wide margins in December after a referendum found nearly 69 percent of Bermudians oppose gay marriage. https://t.co/fje8QR6xvt
God loves us with an “everlasting love” (Jeremiah 31:3). He can bring comfort, healing, and hope to broken and grieving hearts. https://t.co/fKYrdDqPRs

Cayleigh was escorted to the dance by First Sgt. Joseph Bierbrodt who said “it was an honor to do this for her.” She was treated to a limousine ride, given flowers, &amp; they danced the night away. I’m sure it was an evening she’ll never forget! 2/2 https://t.co/5SACm278sU

I think @Cornell University should’ve expelled these students permanently for their ‘pig roast.’ The fraternity’s prescribed review, probation, and re-education just isn’t enough—really just a slap on the wrist. 2/2 https://t.co/Fg4Yp84CEG
Zeta Beta Tau fraternity at @Cornell held a sex contest called the ‘pig roast’ in ref. to the weight of the women they slept with. It’s reprehensible. Their blatant immorality coupled w/ their degrading treatment of women deserves severe consequences. 1/2	https://t.co/3wL2kj5wZw

“Our rights are not given to us by man, our rights come from our Creator. That is why the words “Praise be to God” are etched atop the Wash. Monument…So today we praise God for how truly blessed we are to be American.” –@POTUS @realDonaldTrump #NationalPrayerBreakfast
It was a privilege to be at the #NationalPrayerBreakfast. @POTUS Trump said, “Each year this event reminds us that faith is central to American life &amp; to liberty. Our founders invoked our Creator 4x in the Declaration of Independence. Our currency declares ‘In God We Trust.’”
The Bible says, “Continue earnestly in prayer, being vigilant in it with thanksgiving;” (Colossians 4:2)

I can’t imagine the regret these 46 politicians will one day have when they stand before God, the Creator, &amp; realize the opportunity they had to do good, but they voted NO to protecting lives. They voted against human rights, the right to be born.	https://t.co/s0OcwLGusb

Whatever the #StateoftheUnion, as a nation, we need to humble ourselves, pray, &amp; ask for mercy from God who can sympathize w/ our weaknesses. Pray for humility for all those that govern us across this nation, that we the people would humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God.

...And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, ‘Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?’” (Mark 4:37-41).
...and he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, ‘Peace! Be still!’ And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. He said to them, ‘Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith?’
“And a great windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was already filling. But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion. And they woke him and said to him, ‘Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?’

“For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast" (Ephesians 2:8-9).
The remedy is putting our faith and trust in Jesus Christ who died on a cross for the sin of all mankind—my sins, your sins, @BrianRoss’s sins, @realDonaldTrump’s sins. Isn’t it great to know that we have a Savior?! https://t.co/3qs9HfK25n
.@BrianRoss of @ABC News lied last week, and his lie caused the stock market to go down 350 points costing some investors millions of dollars. But the cost of sin is even more serious than the loss of millions of dollars. 	https://t.co/v3RfYZPOO3
The Bible says that telling a lie is a sin. It also says that there will be no liars in heaven. The fact is, all of us have lied. That’s why we need forgiveness, that’s why we need a Savior to redeem us. https://t.co/3qs9HfK25n

God is anxious for us to come to Him in repentance and ask for His forgiveness and help. True healing comes through trusting Jesus Christ in faith and following Him as the Lord of our lives.
One sin leads to others and can have a great impact on our own lives and the lives of those around us. Sin has devastating consequences—here on earth, and for eternity.
The Bible tells us, “…be sure your sin will find you out.” This is a warning to all of us to examine our lives. That doesn’t just apply to movie stars, media personalities, and politicians, but to everyone.
