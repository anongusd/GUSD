DOE’s proposed changes to its process rule will help prevent situations like the proposed dishwasher efficiency standard in 2015, which was later retracted for insignificant #energy savings and degraded dishwasher function.  https://t.co/tGCuA7d2ui
AHAM commends the DOE for its proposal to update its process rule for the first time since 1996. The proposal includes steps that would allow manufacturers to gauge the real-world impact of the standards before they take effect. https://t.co/tGCuA7d2ui
Modernizing the DOE’s process rule will bring greater transparency and consistency to the development of appliance efficiency standards. AHAM’s statement: https://t.co/tGCuA7d2ui
Modern dishwashers have water temperature boosters to heat water up to 170 degrees. The combination of hot water and intense spray can negate the need to rinse before washing. This can save a lot of water. #EnergyEfficiency
In 2003 @ENERGY established a minimum efficiency standard - 2.3 kWh of energy per load. Today's efficient dishwashers use a quarter of that, averaging only 0.8 kWh per load. #EnergyEfficiency
24 cents: The cost to run your electric oven at 350 degrees for an hour. #EnergyEfficiency https://t.co/nF0R9Q5BVo

AHAM opposes Calif. AB 1906 because it ineffectually places cybersecurity in the hands of a patchwork of courtrooms and juries. Important security innovation is best done through national consensus standards.
We share the objectives of AB1906 – to increase cybersecurity. But technology moves quickly, and slow-moving laws are the wrong way to address the security of advanced products like connected appliances.
Kevin Messner of @AHAM_voice reiterated during the @shecco ATMO Future of the Industry Debate that the home appliance industry has already begun the transition to non-HFC refrigerants. But policymakers @EPA need to take critical steps to move the transition into full swing. https://t.co/VbZbZD1Ur0

Connected home appliances allow consumers to save additional time, conserve energy, integrate the use of renewable energy and pave the way for faster and more accurate repairs.
AHAM advocates for policies that help bring innovations from the idea stage into homes around the world. The world of new features will continue to grow and evolve as technology improves and new customer needs are recognized and met.
AHAM led the development of the industry’s first #sustainability standards, which give consumers, manufacturers, retailers and others tools by which to assess the #EnvironmentalEfficiency of appliances.
AHAM is a strong advocate for the alignment of U.S. and Canadian energy-efficiency standards. Learn more: https://t.co/6fqMKHGv1Y
Home appliances are among the most #EnergyEfficient products available.  Many of today’s models use far less energy than those of a decade ago. AHAM advocates for policies that allow home appliances to perform at a high level while using minimal energy.
AHAM engages lawmakers &amp; regulators at the federal, state &amp; local levels to craft public policy that gives manufacturers the flexibility they need to develop innovative, high-quality products that simplify the lives of consumers around the world.
AHAM recognizes the importance of following the recommended #safety procedures when a service provider is working with or around appliances with 'cold product' refrigerants in order to reduce the risk of fire or explosion.		Read AHAM's guidelines here - https://t.co/1EL51p9nJd
