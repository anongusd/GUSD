President George Washington appointed the most Supreme Court justices - 11 - because he appointed the first Court. FDR comes in second with 8 since he tried to stack #SCOTUS because they kept finding his New Deal proposals unconstitutional which is why we have a cap now.
Interesting fact: President William Henry Harrison is the only president to not make any appointments in office since he died one month into office. (Even presidents need to take some sick days, which Harrison did not).
President Reagan had the most confirmations - 402. President Carter had the most appointments per year - 65.5. 		These are Article III court appointments/confirmations.
For perspective: President Obama appointed 329 in his two terms, President Bush appointed 330, and President Clinton appointed 379. He's a little over half-way through his first term. If this current pace continues, provided he's re-elected, he's on pace to appoint 360. https://t.co/UaE99Qt7ES

Though I will say if you are one who does not vaccinate your children be respectful of those whose immune systems have been compromised and keep your kids at a distance.
So my position is based on personal liberty, not on some conspiracy or opposition to all vaccines. However, people can choose not to vaccinate their kids can, for the most part, do so safely because most of us did have our kids vaccinated.
That said, I do not like the idea of government mandates. Dr. Jane Orient wrote an article for @CaffThoughts that offers some food for thought. "If government can dictate what you must inject into your own children, what limits can be placed on its power?" https://t.co/DQqBpqxKUg

Certainly, there are obnoxious sycophants with outsized platforms who will defend him at any cost, but for the silent majority of evangelicals, this is why. Without this, his level of support would look far different.

“Have you not known? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable,” (Isaiah 40:28, ESV).
There are serious First Amendment and parental rights implications with bills like this. Not to mention they treat these things as though they are immutable conditions which is not the case. Also, what about kids for whom these feelings are unwanted and want help? Crazy.
Fifteen states already ban this for minors. I looked at several current bills including one in Nebraska that wants to add exposure to conversion therapy to the state’s definition of child abuse. Thankfully, that was withdrawn.
Working on a story for @TheNatPulse about a ban on ”conversion therapy” that passed in the Colorado House. It includes any sexual orientation or gender identity change efforts including talk therapy, not just controversial practices like aversion therapy or electroshock therapy.

@TimOverlin @LauraRBelin @IAGovernor And again where would these people be tried if arrested for violating said law?
@TimOverlin @LauraRBelin @IAGovernor And the courts and everyone else would ignore that because she doesn't have that kind of power.
@TimOverlin @LauraRBelin @IAGovernor Dude, just like I said about BVP touting an executive order when he campaigned for gov, the Iowa Constitution does not give the Governor that kind of power. 		Where would these folks be tried?
@TimOverlin @LauraRBelin @IAGovernor Retention elections are the best route to go. As far as, what Governor Reynolds can do, exactly how would she enforce saying "enough"?
@TimOverlin @LauraRBelin @IAGovernor I agree that the legislature can do more and defunding and impeachment are in their realm. The problem with defunding, however, is the strain it would put on our criminal justice system. It's not practical. Impeachment certainly if you can make a case for malfeasance.
@LauraRBelin @IAGovernor You could be right. I don't know and I don't know what they know.
@LauraRBelin @IAGovernor I'm saying I don't know. I'm sure Governor Branstad thought he made some good picks as well and we know how that turned out. I have very little trust in the current judicial nomination process, 50 percent are still decided by members of the bar.
@TimOverlin @LauraRBelin @IAGovernor Tim, appealing the decision isn't standing up to the courts, it's giving the court exactly what they want. This is why the constitutional amendment is so important.
@LauraRBelin @IAGovernor Right now based on what I've seen, we have a Court that will expand abortion rights if given the opportunity. Perhaps Justice Christiansen isn't an activist judge, but if she's anything like say, Chief Justice Roberts, it could be a problem.
@LauraRBelin Possibly, but it's not certain. The way the judicial nomination commission is set up @IAGovernor may have had to decide between three less than ideal options. I didn't see anything in the material made available that gave me any insight into an abortion case or even philosophy.
Here's my article after the Iowa Supreme Court ruled against the 72-hour waiting period for abortion. This gives us a good sense that the court not only would rule against the fetal heartbeat ban but could even expand abortion rights. #iapolitics #iagov https://t.co/3AQKt19ymL

I should add that Republicans who, rightly, complained about Obama's executive overreach but ignore it or defend it when Trump does it are also guilty of partisan hackery. There is no "Congress didn't give me my way so here's my pen and phone" clause in the Constitution.
@bemason9 It's not about whether or not I like him. That's irrelevant. There's no "Congress won't do it so I'm going to go ahead and do it" clause in the Constitution. That wasn't ok with Obama and it's not ok for Trump.

@charlescwcooke "By early afternoon, the claim will be all the media are talking about, and the talking points on both sides of the political divide will have become preposterously, mind-numbingly stupid."

Re. federal system... Obviously, it's the President who appoints, but I was applying it at the state level. I wanted to mention that before someone jumps down my throat, LOL.
@ashtayers That said, I'd gladly trade that for the federal system.
@ashtayers The only thing I like about Iowa's current system is the retention vote. I don't think anyone should be in a position for life without the consent of voters and they don't happen often enough to have an undue influence on how they decide cases.
@ashtayers The process certainly has room for improvement.
The current process is political, it's just done behind the scenes. Also, the Iowa Bar Association has far, far too much influence. What's wrong with the federal system of the Governor appointing and the Senate giving advice and consent? https://t.co/cGNAYtZB6p

Correction. I did once over five years ago, but responded to initial news. So saying I never reported on this is incorrect and I apologize. I have never trolled divorce filings though and never will. Here's the link: https://t.co/IjWkR49rq6 https://t.co/8uE3sLExt2
@RDierks Anyway, you got me Ryan. I did it once almost six years ago in all my almost 16 years of blogging. I still never trolled through divorce filings and I never will.
@RDierks I also wrote, "He should be the family guy his campaign has portrayed him as by focusing on is kids.  It’s going to take longer than a month.  If possible, he should seek reconciliation and fight for his marriage.  That’s what I would do."
@RDierks Read my reply.
@RDierks That just came to mind and I was going to address it. I did that once because he was in the middle of a campaign.  What I didn't do was post his divorce filings online. I wouldn't do that today. It's fair to point out my op/ed though.
@iMattBell Well, the media did not do themselves any favors. Some people need to be fired and/or sued over it.
@alexandraheuser Her office sent out a press release several weeks ago so I knew it was happening. She requested privacy which is obviously being ignored by the media and the left as they appear to be waiting like vultures for the documents to drop. It is sad.
@iMattBell Totally not surprised.
@TheJeffBurkett I want to make it clear that this is totally on those who confront. Not blaming the kids at all.
@TheJeffBurkett Unfortunately, the MAGA hats draw unwanted attention because some people have lost their mind. It's not right, but it happens. Obviously, they are free to wear what they want, but they need to be prepared, esp. in DC while protests are going on.

@tripgabriel @SteveKingIA I shared two examples in my thread.
@tripgabriel @SteveKingIA Well, perhaps that's the problem. It's also the reason why there is a growing distrust of your profession.
This is the kind of thing that drives me nuts and I'm not entirely sure you realize the bias that has leaked into your story. It's why a lot of people don't trust the media.
Wouldn't it be better to just quote him accurately and let readers decide how to label his comments?
Here's another: "Mr. King’s racist remarks over the years have mainly been directed at undocumented Latino immigrants. He was years ahead of Mr. Trump in calling for a concrete border wall, in demonizing migrants as violent criminals and opposing any plan to legalize..."
One example: "There are many reasons Mr. King has been re-elected repeatedly despite years of white identity politics."

@kearneyiowa @pahanse @IowaGOPer @garonsen @linkiowa If I did not personally know him, I might feel the same way. I am not going to defend his statements or associations. I just refuse to label him. He earned this primary challenge, the voters can decide.
The best shot Democrats would have is with a blue dog, pro-life candidate who was a veteran. Not a left-wing darling who gets the attention of Hollywood. #IA04
I’ve explained this numerous times. The best opportunity to knock off @SteveKingIA in the #IA04 is through a primary with a likeable, known, and trusted conservative. Democrat kept nominating people who are out of touch with voters in the district. https://t.co/3FM5Xg3Wd4

@pahanse @IowaGOPer @garonsen @linkiowa Yeah not going to embrace your POV, sorry. He has made some clumsy remarks, some of which have been taken out of context, but clumsy nonetheless.

@GilleyBraggcjoy I want to be hospitable, but is it immoral to ask people to use the front door and not a window. Having open borders is not tenable whether it is a wall, fencing, additional manpower and/or electronic security. We need a secure border.
@GilleyBraggcjoy Ok, that is a fiscal argument, not a moral one.
@GilleyBraggcjoy How is a wall immoral? I’m sympathetic to aspects of immigration reform, but this does not make sense.

@Joel_Kurtinitis @KimReynoldsIA @IowaSOS That said, I don't think abortion was the driving issue for those voters - Medicaid privatization, mental health, and Trump probably were, but it's impossible to say for certain without any exit polling.
@Joel_Kurtinitis @KimReynoldsIA I'm not sure that it didn't among independent women in the suburbs. We'll have to wait to see that data when the @IowaSOS releases the statistical report.
@Joel_Kurtinitis @KimReynoldsIA The only Republican who voted against who is not returning is Chip Baltimore in HD 47 who quit due to his OWI. At least we had a pro-life pick-up there with Thompson, but in terms of those who voted for six seats were lost (we picked up a couple as well) net loss - 4.
@Joel_Kurtinitis @KimReynoldsIA In fact, even Cownie voted for it. Bloomingdale voted against, she won HD 51. Hein voted against, he won HD 96. Maxwell voted against, he won HD 76. McKean voted against, he won HD 58. Zumbach voted against, he won HD 95.
@Joel_Kurtinitis @KimReynoldsIA Koester would have also kept his seat. I think Highfill supported heartbeat as well, those are the two incumbents who lost that surprised me. HD 42 with Cownie, that was going to be a next to impossible seat to hold.
@Joel_Kurtinitis @KimReynoldsIA I'll also say it's probably primarily "no party" voters. I don't think we had a mass suburban Republican shift towards Democrats.
@carrifex I don't recall it stinking up the Metro before. Used to experience that when I lived in Bondurant, but not since I lived in Des Moines.
@Joel_Kurtinitis @KimReynoldsIA Granted, I think had @KimReynoldsIA vetoed the heartbeat bill that would have sunk her with her base and she would have lost.
@Joel_Kurtinitis @KimReynoldsIA Joel, I beg to differ, that may have played a role, but incumbents who lost, lost in suburban areas that went for Democrats. For your analysis to be 100% accurate, the GOP would have retained SD 9 and HD 60. I think what we saw was a Trump effect away from GOP in those areas.

@bigredmatt1011 More to it than that. Suburban women I think came out in support of Democrats judging from the Iowa House seats that were lost.
@bigredmatt1011 Black Hawk County turnout and Linn County turnout were probably the biggest factors. GOP lost some House seats in both of those counties.
@bigredmatt1011 It's always leaned Democrat, independent voters went with Finkenauer.
Iowa Senate Republicans expanded their majority with a net gain of three seats for a 31 to 17 majority. A few Democrat activists who gave me grief about this over the summer need to eat some crow. #justsaying #ialegis #iapolitics
Iowa House Republicans will retain the majority, by how much is still to be determined. Democrats needed to pick up 10 seats. Thus far they only had a net gain of 5. #ialegis #iapolitics

@greghauenstein @BMaunu Take the "birthright citizenship" argument out of this for a second. The action he is taken is unconstitutional, just as President Obama's actions on immigration were unconstitutional. Now on the argument itself, if Congress addressed this, I'm not sure SCOTUS would.
@BMaunu Yes, I agree that they are different. There is still no case law or anything in the U.S. Code that addresses this. That will change if the executive order is signed. I have no idea how SCOTUS will rule on this.
@carrifex Also disgusted by President Obama's elevation of identity politics which had a hand in giving us President Trump.

@BMaunu Um, yes it is. How it is specifically applied may not be, but birthright citizenship definitely is. Let me help you out. They have not ruled on children of illegal immigrants. SCOTUS has ruled on children of legal immigrants though.
President Trump does not have the constitutional authority to eliminate by executive order birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants born here any more than President Obama had the constitutional authority to grant DACA or amnesty. #immigration

I don’t regret going into youth ministry, but I regret two years of private school tuition that could have been spent in community college. I did meet my wife my sophomore year and came to Christ at Drake, so there’s that, but not the best fiscal choice.
Spending five years in a private school (five years because I transferred) to become a youth pastor (which has notoriously bad pay) was not a wise choice.
Also, students need to be aware of their ability to pay after they graduate and not be afraid of going part-time, taking gen ed in community college, and working their way through school. I thank God that my kids are not repeating my mistake.
Part of the problem is that feds kept approving loans that were larger and larger as colleges raised tuition, room and board, etc.		The other part is that people pay it. If feds capped amount, and people attended where tuition is reasonable -that would make an impact. https://t.co/LqYoTnpkXI

Also, I do try to be objective and not be overly partisan. Hence why I criticize the right probably more frequently than I criticize the left. Can you say the same Jeff?
Also, just a reminder, I'm also registered "no party" so I am open to third-party candidates.
Also a big difference between me and the DMR - I admit my bias. I am very transparent about the worldview I write from and the lens in which I view politics, culture, and current events.
Also, I'd like to point out there are a number of Republicans that I would not endorse which is why when I do endorse I don't endorse in every race. 		Frankly, I don't think endorsements mean a whole heck of a lot anyway.
I'd be open to endorsing a blue dog, pro-life Democrat (if I were making endorsements this cycle, which I am not)... Have any of those running? Are they even allowed in the party anymore? #iapolitics
Nope. I haven't. The make-up of the editorial board has also changed. 		I guess the question I'm asking Jeff, are we supposed to ignore all of the editorials  they have written in the last two years? Four years? https://t.co/TzhKrcOQL7
@JPerryDemocrat @DMRegister @KimReynoldsIA The make-up of the editorial board has changed. It has always been left of center, but it has tacked either further left. I guess we are supposed to ignore all of the editorials they have written in the two years prior to this election.
@lynjfry @DMRegister @KimReynoldsIA Personally, if I were advising her campaign I'd say go do it for the reasons you gave, but I reject the idea she could have received their endorsement by going.
What???? LOL, this is nuts even for PETA. https://t.co/9FBUbtb9Bo

@desmoinesdem @SteveKingIA I don't know exactly what she promotes that he likes, and frankly, I don't have the time or inclination to do a deep dive into Toronto's mayoral race. 		I doubt it's because she's a white nationalist though.
@desmoinesdem @SteveKingIA Half the time I think he does this just to get a reaction from the left.
@desmoinesdem @SteveKingIA You have a worldview with which you filter what everyone says, as do I. 		I don't agree with everything he says or tweets, but I understand where he's coming from on some of these issues. Could he find a better way to articulate it? Yes. Would getting off Twitter help? Yes.
@desmoinesdem @SteveKingIA It's easy to call someone you don't really know a racist, esp. on social media.
@desmoinesdem @SteveKingIA Has he said things I disagree with? Is there policy I disagree with him on? Absolutely. Unfortunately, people want to assume the worst instead of engaging with some of the policy concerns behind what he says.
@desmoinesdem @SteveKingIA Just curious have you had numerous conversations with the man? Have you had meals with him? Do you know his family?

@ashtayers Well, the Supreme Court disagrees with you on that one.
@ELeeBakker In terms of ideology that is.
@ELeeBakker Not really, and it fails to address my point - Democrats used to have pro-life folks in it. They used to have fiscal conservatives. 		BTW, under the age of Trump I have plenty of issues with the Republican Party. I just reject the notion that Democrats are this big tent.
@painterkim Ok then so basically you're saying practically everyone in the Republican Party. Yeah, that's workable.
@ashtayers So are we adopting a speech distribution argument here???
@ELeeBakker 🙄
@lltwing @painterkim @DMRegister The Gospel
@ashtayers $$ pays for speech and restrictions on advertisements is a restriction on speech.
@painterkim I see that the exact opposite. The GOP seems to be expanding its tent while Democrats are tacking to the left. For instance, what happened to pro-life Democrats? What happened to blue dog Dems? Also, exactly who are you calling "extremist"?
@lltwing @painterkim @DMRegister So you're equating the books with Christ's message? I'm not "afraid" to read those books, and I didn't say I wouldn't. But don't give conspiracies much attention whether they are on the left or the right.
@ashtayers I abhor how much money it takes to run for office, but I also don't believe in additional regulation and it's a free speech issue. As I said, the problem is an uninformed electorate. Get to know candidates beyond political ads.
@lltwing @painterkim @DMRegister Laura, I'm very familiar with ALEC and have mixed feelings about them, and no, I'm not being fooled. I do value our right to vote. We are a constitutional republic that is democratic and I value that. That is not being taken away. What specifically are you talking about?
@ashtayers You are right, money shouldn't determine who represents us, but an uninformed electorate, not money is the problem. BTW, in Iowa where Democrats have outraised Republicans, it has been from out-of-state money. #justsaying
