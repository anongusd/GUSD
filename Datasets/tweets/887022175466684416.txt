God is always ready to give what you need,  but how badly,  you do effort to attain your desire as a need.. This is the main thing!!!... Always remember and believe  that thoughts become things as God diffuses in.
God flows through man in the exact  degree that man opens himself for God  to do so. And man opens himself to God by  Learning of himself and Realizing his Need of God. It matters most as long as we agree of the great central fact that we need God in our Lives.
It is difficult to judge how our actions and their impact on the environment are likely to affect others.what is clear is that we are only the species with the power to destroy the Earth.Birds,other mammals and insect have no such power, let us protect, and get the best out of it https://t.co/EtyRvWM77o
