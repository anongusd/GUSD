Please fire CGM.

@Espngreeny That's a catch if it's the patriots.
@davebryant @yeshuabryant So, what's the problem?
@epollaert @NollaBud @GDouglasJones Do you mean like the democrat "shenanigans" with Scott Brown and the Obamacare vote?

@CollegeAndMag The same way their lineman could tackle and hold all game.
@BarrettSallee War Eagle!
@ESPNCFB @NissanUSA @AyeyoKEJO should win #HeismanHouse vite!
@AuburnSportts I felt the same at times but then Gus seemed to regroup and the offense got back on track.
@VanAllenPlexico Probably
@joshdub_ 1-7 under Gus in last 8 games against top 10 teams.
@Jag4life11 @AUFAMILY Exactly right!
@robpate @247Sports I'm not worried about the team having "lava in their veins". I'm concerned about Gus.
@JamesCrepea If you do what you've always done then you always get what you've always got. No to Tubbs.
@AUFAMILY What qualifications dies tubberville have to be AD? He is an average coach that beat Shula 4 times, Franchionie and Saban in his 1st year.
@BarrettSallee Keep Tubberville on TV and out of the Auburn Athletic Department.
@BradTLaw @AUTigerBloggin Its less likely we leave a top ten team.
@jckjes7 #1 key to beating UGA is keeping Gus off the headphones.
@BarrettSallee I wish kiffin were coming to Auburn.
@brv_inc @AuburnPrez @AuburnPrez  is trying to be professional about the situation.
@SkyeUnderwood Beth Moanings should only be allowed on ESPN 3.
@AuburnSportts We need a coach that knows how to beat average teams. I will never be for UAT.
@aldotcom @KevinScarbinsky None of the above except maybe Pollard from Iowa State. No more "Auburn men".
@KevinScarbinsky This will not matter if Auburn hires another "auburn man".
@chdmelvin @CollegeAndMag Sweet justice for leaving Russell Athletic.
@Lane_Kiffin I wish you were coming to Auburn.
@SkyeUnderwood @aufamilynews Thats because no one watches as much Au Football as the fans. We have been let down 2 many times.
@VanAllenPlexico I won't be upset if a loss gets rid of Gus.
@cheerforau @VanAllenPlexico Auburn is capable of beating UGA but we have Gus to kick red zone FGs and to run every 1st down.
@leftoutcast @NolanShaw1 @WarBlogle It would be great to have lane kiffin at Auburn.  He is a far superior coach to high school Gus.
@aufamilynews Really? I never would have figured that out?
@AuburnSportts We need to convince Aand M that it's a 6 pm kick.
@SportsTalkwBo Thanks for nothing hogs. I was hoping you would win and save us from Gus. I'll help him load the U haul if you will take him.
@VanAllenPlexico Finebaum is teasing me.
@WarBlogle No, last week is what we usually do against a good team or UAT and UGA.
@golfwizkid Here you go. FIRE GUS!! Another victory over a garbage team.
@JamesJones_55 I agree with your point also.
@CollegeAndMag Arky should fire bert and hire Gus.
@JamesJones_55 Malik could have helped spark tge offense LAST week.
@aufamilynews FIRE GUS! I promise he will let us down again.
@aufamilynews You mean Gus didn't learn from FSU and all the other infuriating losses from getting conservative?
@jckjes7 I'm done with Gus for this very reason. Getting conservative and too many field goals against too many teams.
@NewToomersOaks And FSU,and UGA the last 2 years etc. FIRE GUS!
@CollegeAndMag I'm just done with Gus.
@WarDamnGray I want Gus gone so bad. Gus uses Auburn to get revenge on Arky. Gus does not seem to care about beating UAT and UGA.
@CollegeAndMag All he cares about is beating the pigs. What about UGA and UAT?
Why didn't you keep your "foot on the gas" last week? Please resign!
@PeterSanto29 thank you for having the courage to call for the end of Malzahn. I'm a digruntled alumni.
@ClayTravis Auburn fans need your help. Help us get rid of Gus. Add him to your  list along with Butch.
@SeanInTheSky @bmarcello Gus doesn't even ever adjust before a game. Every "gameplan" is the very same. When do we do anything different?
@VanAllenPlexico You were nervous because at the end of the day we still have a high school head coach in over his head.
@VanAllenPlexico How can you pick just one? If we don't win this one then we may never win at LSU again.
@VanAllenPlexico Gus channeled his inner Tommy Tuberville in the 2nd half.
@heartofauburn Challenging
@WILDMANBS It's inexcusable and time for Gus to go back to high school, if a high school would even hire him.
@AuburnSportts No more clich√©s!
@BobbyofHomewood An Alabama 6A school wouldn't hire Gus.
@BillisKing You must not have seen Auburn today.
@AuburnSportts If "ifs and buts were candy nuts, we would all have a merry Christmas "
@AUtitude @aufamilynews Just fire Gus at halftime.
@VanAllenPlexico No, but I will now. I just found it.
@VanAllenPlexico will you get on the fire Gus bus?
@WarBlogle I guess Auburn is officially a "softball school".
@bradleyryanV @willycardin @AUFAMILY It really doesn't matter what i think. Another loss to UAT, UGA, LSU and Gus will be gone.
@willycardin @bradleyryanV @AUFAMILY The offense should be ready to go at the start of the season.  Gus is an offensive "guru".
@willycardin @bradleyryanV @AUFAMILY Then we should have kept chizik. He had a better 4 year record than Gus.
@willycardin @bradleyryanV @AUFAMILY 3 years of mediocrity and one very lucky year under Gus. I've seen enough.
@TheAuburner You mean thats not the move we need to win a championship?
@VanAllenPlexico Kelly wouldn't come to Auburn anyway.
@bradleyryanV @willycardin @AUFAMILY So you are ok with mediocrity?
@Softykjr I would have rather heard finger nails on a chalkboard.
@Espngreeny I hope bengals lose every game for signing Mixon.
@seanbreedlove @ForeverAuburn @robpate Gus "lost it " in 2nd half against FSU.
@AUFAMILY JJ and Gus need to be fired now!
@VanAllenPlexico Feels like another 6-6 season ahead.
@jckjes7 Exactly. Gus won't adapt to the QBs skill set.
@WarBlogle Time for Gus to go!
