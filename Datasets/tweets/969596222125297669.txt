Finally, I am breaking one of the rules set by Epictetus: If you are studying philosophy, do not talk about that which you have not fully digested. I am being the sheep which spits up its food to show the Shepard it has eaten rather than digesting it for the good of my body.
Most people today view death as a negative thing. With that in mind, we live our lives in complete fear of the unavoidable end. Is it not preferable to view it as similar to the long awaited rest at the end of a long journey?
Several takeaways from tonight's reading of Epictetus. The first of which is that man should not fear death. In essence, what disturbs men are not things -- but merely the ways in which we interpret things. We fear death, because we view death as something to be feared.
Tonight's meditations centered around the Enchiridion of Epictetus. If you are even remotely curious in delving into the study of philosophy, I highly recommend it.
‚ÄúI have to die. If it is now, well then I die now; if later, then now I will take my lunch, since the hour for lunch has arrived - and dying I will tend to later.‚Äù	-Epictetus
