US must do better. We owe it to allies &amp; values. Sadly, two US presidents -- Obama &amp; Trump -- insist on putting politics before values. History will not be kind to their isolationist policies, but until then, Putin celebrates yet another Christmas &amp; will fill vacuum that is left.
Mess in Syria won't clean itself up. If Trump thinks Assad, who unleashed these Sunni &amp; Shia terrorists in Syria, can put his genie back in the bottle, he's wrong. Even if he could, allowing Assad/Iran/Russia to continue their terror is morally &amp; strategically bankrupt outcome.
Real progress was made in fight against ISIS, but that could evaporate, just as our progress in Iraq evaporated after Obama prematurely withdrew in 2011. ISIS is not gone yet for us to debate whether it will come back. Packing up now only ensures we will have to go back later on.
ISIS is not defeated. Al-Qaeda in Syria is not defeated. Assad is still in power, &amp; there is no political solution anywhere in sight. Iran continues to expand, threatening stability of Syria and the region. These are serious issues that demand our sustained effort and presence.
Trump's abrupt exit from Syria will result in huge harm to our allies &amp; mission. SDF sacrificed tremendously in fight against ISIS. People in NE Syria endured much horror, first by Assad, later by ISIS. How can we leave them alone against Assad, Iran, Russia, Turkey &amp; ISIS?

.@RaedFares4 and @hamodjnaid were almost always together, joking &amp; laughing. There was never a dull moment in their presence. I will forever cherish those beautiful moments. Goodbye, dear Hamod. https://t.co/WVSHuMZwBD
He never sat down for more than a few minutes; he was always uploading videos or going to get something or pouring tea or cleaning the floor with a little roller vacuum.
In the morning, @hamodjnaid would be first to come to the office where I would sleep with Raed &amp; Khaled. Usually we'd still be asleep when he'd unlock and open the door, carrying fresh bread, and he would start making tea and breakfast.
He had a motorcycle I would ride on with him, and he would take me around  town and tell me jokes about different people we passed by. He went to the front lines of many battles in Idlib and Aleppo. In 2015, he too was abducted and imprisoned by Jabhat Al-Nusra, with Raed.
Hamod was an amazing journalist and videographer. He was the first person at the scene of any bombing or airstrike by the regime, and he would often come back badly hurt but with incredible video and a huge smile. We would laugh and marvel at how close he had come to death.
Hamod Jnaid @hamodjnaid, unknown to many, was a legend and a hero in his own right, and was tragically taken away from us on Friday in the same assassination attack that took @RaedFares4. https://t.co/8ifWfQaprr

.@RaedFares4 knew this this day would come. He prepared his disciples for it. He believed that the Revolution couldn't be killed and that's why Raed Fares is more than a man. He is bigger than a giant. He is an institution. He is a legend.
To the cowards who killed @RaedFares4: you have killed just a man but you will never kill the legend or his vision for a free Syria. Raed Fares will live on, through all of us, through his work and through the pure Revolution that he fought for until his final days.
Fearing he might be assassinated, @RaedFares4 gave instructions to his loyal students about how to continue what he had built. Radio Fresh will continue. URB will continue. The Revolution that he taught us the meaning of will continue.
.@RaedFares4 knew his life was in imminent danger, especially the last weeks. It was always very dangerous, yet he enthusiastically accepted the risk. He knew Al-Qaeda's thugs wanted him dead, and in the past month, he could feel that their noose was tightening around his neck.
How sad to see clueless commentators saying "the last of the moderate Syrians is dead." If @RaedFares4 were alive, he'd make 10 banners mocking that nonsense. There are hundreds more, many trained by the legendary Raed himself. The extremists will not defeat his indomitable will.

Thank you, @RaedFares4, for everything. I will miss you so much.
I'm blessed to have been able to witness the brilliant man that is @RaedFares4, the best of what humanity can offer. To those who knew Raed, help me keep his legacy alive. To those who didn't, take time now to see the man who wanted to change the world from a small town in Syria.
.@RaedFares4 saw so much horror on a daily basis. Regime hated him; Islamist extremists hated him even more,and threatened to kill him repeatedly. I asked constantly: aren't you afraid of being killed? And he would just laugh.
All I want right now is to hear it again, so that he can fill me with hope in another dark moment and tell me that everything will be fine... he would probably remind me that the Revolution is an idea and ideas cannot be killed.
I remember countless nights with him, just listening to him talk after he had finished brainstorming a new protest banner and cartoon. We talked about everything: Syria, the world, Revolution, religion, life and love... I could listen to his voice forever.
I used to wait for any opportunity--Thanksgiving, winter break, any opportunity at all--to fly to Turkey and go to the border where Raed and Hamod would be waiting to take me to Kafranbel, Syria, a small yet perfect world of hope &amp; meaning Raed had created in the middle of war.
I was shocked this morning to see the news that my friends @RaedFares4 and Hamod Jnaid were killed by unknown gunmen in their hometown of Kafranbel.		Raed was more than an activist, more than a revolutionary, more than a friend, more than a leader, more than a hero... https://t.co/jRlbAPjxHu
