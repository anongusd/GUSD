@FirstLadyVA @PamNorthamVA @RichmondMag I stand with you Mrs. Northam There are some people who love to use racism to get attention but care nothing about educating black children or teaching black history. Thank you for the “teaching moment”.
@PrincessBasmah Inshallah my sister friend 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
I took my grandkids to Charleston to understand the Slave experience. Putting cotton into a student (black or White) hand is not racist. @GovernorVA wife provided a teaching moment for all students that is absent in studies. Look how @HolocaustMuseum instructs us. @PamNorthamVA https://t.co/en0HDizess
I agree. I took my grandkids to Charleston to have a clue of the Slave trade and harsh life the enslaved endured. My guides were Black &amp; White historians who engaged my young brood. @PamNorthamVA isn’t racist. #teachingmoments needed. #snowflakegeneration https://t.co/Ll3NGxSdcg

@tonyschwartz @CrystalMcCrary And 90 million folk didn't vote so we wouldn't have this mess. This is the real mystery. Not them but us.
@CrystalMcCrary 7. Lastly, when it comes to our presidential election, that day should be a national holiday since it is the ultimate liberty of an American citizen to vote. This will be a flag to every citizen that they matter in the tapestry of this nation which is frayed by poor leadership.💫
@CrystalMcCrary 6. And in the campaign a 2012 when I travel the country, I noticed we do not have a systematic way of voting that we require of "developing" countries that receive our aid. We need a one way voting for everybody. Two steps in Texas, no caucuses in Colorado, etc.
@CrystalMcCrary 5. Did you know most students do not know the constitution? I watched it taken out of schools &amp; raised a red flag. It was a need for black voters back in the day then we learned it and we came unnecessary. Why? Because an educated voter is a dangerous citizen to powers that be.
@CrystalMcCrary 4. Power is local. We have to look at local voting trends for councilmen, governors, Mayors, to garner what interest voters. Many folk feel Prez are bought &amp; depend on activists to defend their nat'l interest. We need social &amp; civic studies back in schools.
@CrystalMcCrary 3. Ultimately, we need better candidates. As Eric B &amp; Rakim rapped "How could I move the crowd? First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed. Here's the instruction, put it together	It's simple ain't it, but quite clever." Voters weren't moved by the candidates.
@CrystalMcCrary 2. Of the 90 million non voters you want to enlist democrats? Estimates show more than 58 percent of eligible voters went to the polls during the 2016 election, nearly breaking even with the turnout rate set during the 2012 presidential election.
@CrystalMcCrary 1. Crystal, people have been tired of the business as usual in our government for years. Each electoral cycle activists work laboriously to GOTV. How many folk didn't vote in 2012? We must look at the demographics and see if poverty; voting methods deterred golds.
@DLOliver @CrystalMcCrary @MichaelEDyson 1. Make sure you have interesting candidates who will make the voters want to go out and vote their best interest. 2. Increase voter education via church and social outlets. 3. Make sure there are ways for potential voters to actually get to the polls.

I am disappointed at the low level journalism. @OMAROSA has the right to tell and sell her story because "What Happened" was she was "Hacked" inside/outside White House and "Everybody Got Something" &amp; "Rules to Live By: From The Heart" @RobinRoberts #Woke  https://t.co/nQy3J54nVr

#FridayFeeling "I've spilled all my emotions" today but I'm not sorry. Adults have to work, work, work &amp; get a face to face with our youth💫
The absence of childhood laughter &amp; the time for youth to learn innocently from trial &amp; error will lead to saddened futures &amp; early graves💫
I've made an observation of youth sequestered in refugee camps in Jordan &amp; those youth in inner cities; the non-existent "Age of Innocence"
1. After a wonderful 24 hours of celebrating my granddaughter Layla's birthday my heart still bleeds for my hometown of Chicago &amp; her youth. https://t.co/SNCZUvSns7
2. My hometown of Chicago violence death toll isn't just results of gun possession. We'd had firearms for years but it is lack of something.
3 In 1985 I joined Soft Sheen founder Ed Gardner in heralding a Black on Black Love Parade in the city. As a former educator who worked with
4 Youth from projects &amp; gangs (w/ knives &amp; guns) their angst was unemployment, isolation on their side of city, poverty &amp; drug infiltration
5. Hope is pimped &amp; Dreams are deferred when youth don't have mentoring, quality education that leads to skill jobs w/ respectable wages...
6 Youth are put the lifestyles of Rich &amp; Famous constantly before them.  whom they are socialized to imitate their wealth then ever before
7 By any means necessary. I love Chicago &amp; Chicagoans. If youth laid down their guns what will grasp to change their reality of lethargy?
8 The answer my friend is not blowing in the Wind(y City)but in the hearts of elected local officials who sat back &amp; watched the urban decay

1. As a person who've experience many insults based upon my race, class, gender, political choices, &amp; now age I offer a reflection on nation
2.  Let's not pretend most citizens of "United" SA aren't misogynistic, bigoted, racist, &amp; class divisive. No party has hierarchy on that...
3. That's why women fight for #EqualPay; #LBGTQ push for same sex marriage laws; sex trafficking &amp; domestic violence orgs are growing; let's
4. Not forget why public education is not equal; blacks &amp; minority men are disproportionately imprisoned; poor farmers land stolen;...
5. Very few minorities in Silicon Valley; &amp; why so many civil rights orgs exist. This run cross political, faith, race lines. Maybe, in 2017

Your vote shouldn't be about who will have rule over USA but who will work within the rules of our legal systems to have JUST governance 🇺🇸
