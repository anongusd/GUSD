#HousingCredit is our country's most important resource for making homes affordable to low-income families, seniors, veterans, people w/ special needs in urban, suburban, and rural areas nationwide – more than 3 million homes over the past 30 years. https://t.co/reXmyDmz8U #LIHTC https://t.co/O9NvJhX8Df
The Abt study is the most comprehensive quantitative analysis of affordable housing development costs to date. It draws on a nationwide database of 2,500 Housing Credit-financed properties containing 160,000+ apartments put in service between 2011-16. https://t.co/reXmyDmz8U https://t.co/ITPVSZAiG0
The Abt analysis indicates the cost to develop #HousingCredit apartments grew by about 8% between 2011-16. A 2017 Fannie Mae report indicated development costs for all apartments rose 10-30% over the same period. https://t.co/reXmyDmz8U #LIHTC https://t.co/ZOC5KBY72S
New research by Abt shows new #HousingCredit development costs are about $209,000/unit. NCSHA analysis indicates avg development costs for all apartments in the same period are $196,000-$204,000/unit. https://t.co/reXmyDmz8U #LIHTC https://t.co/2hzcsnVM4k
New @abtassociates study &amp; additional analysis by NCSHA reveal affordable apartments financed by #HousingCredit cost about the same, on average, to develop as market-rate apartments, despite policy constraints that don’t apply to market-rate developments. https://t.co/reXmyDmz8U
