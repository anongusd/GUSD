Mr. Stone described the FBI as courteous.  You're a US Senator, and you're focused on a single arrest of a guy who may have helped rig an election for commies.  Spend more time trying to fund the government, please. https://t.co/0YODeOokMk

@realDonaldTrump Biggest government shutdown on your watch.  800 thousand people were hurt, and the country suffered.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Thoughts and prayers on your demise.  And stop this pathetic lying, please.
@LindseyGrahamSC This is lipstick on a pig.  Your party caused real damage to the country...and you should all apologize for your dumb ass behavior.
@realDonaldTrump Maybe you should have another diet Coke...and then fund the government.

@JohnCornyn The party with policy demands during a government shutdown loses.  You're losing.  You already approved the CR to fund the government, remember?  Now you're just being an ass and making people go hungry.
@JRubinBlogger So that you would call him Senator?
@senatemajldr @POTUS I can still remember when you were a part of that 100-0 CR that would have kept the goverment funded for a while, comrade.

@JohnCornyn It isn't a crisis, Senator.  You had two years of GOP control, have little to show for it, and now you cry 'crisis'. Fund the government.
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Maybe because he doesn't have empathy.

@ChuckGrassley You already supported the CR to keep parts of our government funded.  Don't blame somebody else.
@RepMarkMeadows This was a top priority for the last two years, and you didn't get it done. Look in the mirror--your performance was pathetic.
@RudyGiuliani I still laugh at how you run a cybersecurity firm and you thought someone hacked your twitter account because of your typo.  Genius!
@SteveScalise Nobody wants open borders, and you had a CR last week to keep the government open.  How'd that go?  You own it.
@LindseyGrahamSC Tough to be such a whiner when you just passed that CR last week. But you seem to have the talent for it.
@DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump Empathy for the little guy...marginally speaking.
@RealCandaceO @V_of_Europe @realDonaldTrump Amazing in a marginal way.
@realDonaldTrump Says the stable genius who declared bankruptcy...multiple times.
@GovernorTomWolf @AynRandPaulRyan Brilliantly done, thanks.
@JohnCornyn Didn't you just pass a CR to keep the government open?
@realDonaldTrump Highest trends recently are ... 	#TrumpShutdown  #TrumpResign
@McfeeMarianne @realDonaldTrump Thanks for the civics lesson.  You don't need a super majority to investigate.  Or issue a subpoena.  Or hold hearings.  And the DOJ is part of the executive branch.
@McfeeMarianne @realDonaldTrump It's so easy to think badly of the Clinton's.  I'm not a fan either.  The GOP has controlled all 3 branches of government for 2 years, and the Clinton Foundation is still 'Scott Free'.  The explanation is very simple, and you need to let it go.
@realDonaldTrump Foundations aren't forced to dissolve when they are legit.
@jeffreypetrello @PodSaveAmerica @jonlovett @jonfavs @TVietor08 @danpfeiffer Being poor.
@BuckSexton Or just tell the truth.
@realDonaldTrump Democrat spin machines like SNL?  C'mon, they make fun of everyone. You're just comedy gold every dang week.
@MickMulvaneyOMB Congrats for not taking 2 steps backward....when everyone else did.
@realDonaldTrump The 1st amendment was 1st for a reason.  You're constantly swimming upstream on this. Intense effort expended to get nowhere, except that journalists are placed in harm's way.  Try golfing a bit more, comrade!
@DeadlineWH @PhilipRucker @NicolleDWallace @WSJ You'll need the Imelda Marcos shoe collection for this administration.
@GrumpyLVdealer @FDRLST I'm somewhere in the middle politically, but I don't think many liberals like commies.  But you might be right.
@joker122652 @FDRLST Thanks for that.  I wasn't a big fan of Clinton either.
@FDRLST Good try.  Climbing into bed with commies is not quite the same thing.  Or the foreign emoluments clause.  Or the self dealing.  Or the cash-to-porn star thing to defraud the election...but keep trying.
@shaunking He went to the very best schools.
@AriFleischer Your comment lost a little oomph today with news that the Russian commie is set to plead guilty.
@CREWcrew As 'smocking' as this may sound, POTUS doesn't read. Better to make a pie chart graphic with color for 'Fox and Friends'.
