Q7. How can American farmers and ranchers help rescind and replace the 2015 #WOTUS rule for good? #DitchTheRuleChat https://t.co/4ceRQBARd4
RT @ZippyDuvall: A6.4. We need a new rule that provides a clear &amp; reasonable definition of ‚Äúnavigable‚Äù within the limits set by Congress. #‚Ä¶
RT @ZippyDuvall: A6.3. We support @EPA &amp; @USACEHQ‚Äôs proposal to rescind the rule. #DitchTheRuleChat
RT @ZippyDuvall: A6.2. We‚Äôve been running our #DitchTheRule campaign for 3+ years. The rule is a severe overreach that would cripple #ag. #‚Ä¶
RT @ZippyDuvall: A6.1. Farm Bureau has opposed #WOTUS since it was proposed for public comment in April 2014. #DitchTheRuleChat
Q6. What has been the American Farm Bureau‚Äôs role in rescinding and replacing the #WOTUS rule? #DitchTheRuleChat https://t.co/9uwY1at7th
RT @ZippyDuvall: A5.4. Farmers &amp; ranchers want to maintain water quality w/o giving the federal gov't regulatory power over farmlands. #Dit‚Ä¶
RT @ZippyDuvall: A5.2 Another misconception is that #ag doesn‚Äôt care about clean water &amp; protecting natural resources. We DO care. #DitchTh‚Ä¶
RT @ZippyDuvall: A5.1 The biggest misconception is that #WOTUS regulates ‚Äúwaters.‚Äù @EPA said it wouldn‚Äôt cover farmlands. But the rule did.‚Ä¶
Q5. What is the biggest misconception about the #WOTUS rule and the opposition to the rule? #DitchTheRuleChat https://t.co/nZm66NCFSY
RT @ZippyDuvall: A4.5. It‚Äôs important that farmers and ranchers submit comments to support the repeal. https://t.co/NzgwdT9LEn #DitchTheRul‚Ä¶
RT @ZippyDuvall: A4.4. @EPA is seeking comments from the public on whether to rescind #WOTUS now through 9/27. https://t.co/NzgwdT9LEn #Dit‚Ä¶
RT @ZippyDuvall: A4.3. The agencies proposed to rescind #WOTUS in June bc it didn't fully consider the role of states in protecting waters.‚Ä¶
RT @ZippyDuvall: A4.2 In February, President Trump signed an executive order telling @EPA &amp; @USACEHQ to reconsider the flawed #WOTUS rule.‚Ä¶
RT @ZippyDuvall: A4.1 The #WOTUS rule was blocked by a federal court in 2015. It is not in effect‚Äîbut that court order is only temporary. #‚Ä¶
Q4. What‚Äôs the current status of the 2015 #WOTUS rule? #DitchTheRuleChat https://t.co/OTpcPBkaHm
RT @ZippyDuvall: A3.2. The Sixth Circuit Court quickly blocked #WOTUS nationwide because the court found it was probably illegal. #DitchThe‚Ä¶
RT @ZippyDuvall: A3.1. No. The flawed 2015 #WOTUS rule was never implemented nationwide. It only briefly went into effect in some states. #‚Ä¶
Q3. Critics say repealing #WOTUS would roll back water quality. Is this true? #DitchTheRuleChat https://t.co/8i3eMcgx6y
RT @ZippyDuvall: A2.4. #WOTUS‚Äô vagueness made farmlands regulatory minefields. Harmless, accidental violations could trigger huge fines. #D‚Ä¶
RT @ZippyDuvall: A2.3. #WOTUS‚Äô overreaching &amp; vague terms = Impossible for farmers to know what parts of their land would be regulated. #Di‚Ä¶
RT @ZippyDuvall: A2.2. Lands regulated by #WOTUS generally cannot be used by farmers, ranchers or others without a federal permit. #DitchTh‚Ä¶
RT @ZippyDuvall: A2.1. #WOTUS was never about water. It was a federal land grab that infringed on the property rights of farmers. #DitchThe‚Ä¶
Q2. How did expanding the definition of #WOTUS negatively impact American farmers &amp; ranchers? #DitchTheRuleChat https://t.co/r9RZ9ssj1o
RT @ZippyDuvall: A1.3. It granted @EPA reg. control over lands that only temporarily hold water (ditches, temporary ponds &amp; lowlands). #Dit‚Ä¶
RT @ZippyDuvall: A1.2. #WOTUS expanded the @EPA and @USACEHQ regulatory authority beyond what Congress approved. #DitchTheRuleChat
RT @ZippyDuvall: A1.The 2015 rule significantly expanded the definition of ‚Äúnavigable waters.‚Äù #DitchTheRuleChat
