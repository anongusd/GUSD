@tribelaw @DiogenesLamp0 @JohnBrennan @realDonaldTrump Trump doesn‚Äôt even know what moral turpitude means.
@sgualdoni @nytimes That was my first response. I grew up around guns and the two things my dad and grandpa always said were treat all guns as if they were loaded and never put a bullet in a gun unless you are immediately planning to shoot. Basic, basic gun safety.

@GreatGabbo @skenigsberg @Avaaz @MoveOn I did not bring up Australia. Their ‚Äúsolution‚Äù would not work here for the reasons you mentioned as well as many others. I am not anti-gun, my husband has many guns. But I am for common sense gun control. I am not for gun prohibition, and never will be.
@MichaelSkolnik Whatever your thoughts are on gun control in general, or Parkland specifically, arresting students is an over-reaction and will simply lead to more student-led activism and protest. Seems silly to take that action as a school unless you want to give students a rallying point.
@GreatGabbo @skenigsberg @Avaaz @MoveOn I appreciate the way you explained your position. Without the easy availability of the ‚Äúincredibly useful deadly tool‚Äù there could be more time to work on those underlying issues instead of attending funerals. I do thank you for pointing out another view on the issue.
@ShaunKing That is what I thought when I read it. Why continue working months for someone you consider a moron?
@dougbies @deedles420 So does this say that you got called to HR twice and one was the bouncy house incident, or you inflated a bouncy house in your office a second time? Just curious!
@GreatGabbo @skenigsberg @Avaaz @MoveOn I respectfully disagree. Suicide can tear apart a community and domestic abuse is a  terrible tragedy. I think this visual points out exactly why common sense gun control is important. School shootings are not the only type of gun violence towards children.

@ShirleyDee_nyc I wish the font you used was Papyrus.
@kylegriffin1 @PoliticsNation The price of the freedom to own machine guns is 58 human lives too high.
I wish NRA gun nuts would all change their minds based on what happened in Las Vegas. But they won't. And it will happen again. #Pray4Vegas
Oh, now I get it. San Juan's mayor @CarmenYulinCruz is female. That is why @realDonaldTrump hates her. No aid to cities led by women.
@JKCorden @StephenAtHome @nickkroll Not awkward enough.
@AmericaFerrera @StephenAtHome @nickkroll Not awkward enough.
@kumailn So much truth in that one short sentence.
I am constantly amazed by @chancetherapper	Watching him on @StephenAtHome just confirms again how talented he is.		Agree?		@ChanceFrom79th

Does @MrRPMurphy do his own casting? Amazing, as always!!	#AHSCULT
Get Woke! #AHSCult
I did not see that coming.  #AHSCult
All I need is #AHSCult and 1 gig internet speed.
RT @the_kelves: No matter how many mistakes you make or how slow you progress, you are still way ahead of everyone who isn‚Äôt trying.
Quit making fun of him. He meant to say "Narnia." https://t.co/ckhSmlXKPC
If anyone ever tells me to calm down, whether justified or not, I am immediately going to yell, "You need to calm up!"  #AHSCult
Whatever one pinky wishes for, will come true. #AHSCult
I remember when I was a little kid and heard bitch on public tv for the first time. #AHSCult
@molly_knight @AngryBlackLady "We aren't for sale!"	"What if I paid you $20 million?"	"Where do we set up?"
Remember - Harry Potter fought evil over the course of 7 books. It has only been 238 days. Stay strong!! #Resistance
@davidmackau @dcbigjohn Makes me want to weep.
"One of us has to work." 	Oh, the passive aggressive resentment in that short statement. 	#AHSCult
RT @JYSexton: Imagine if we covered education and social issues like these storms.
I can't wait to hear what excuse Limbaugh will come up with for why he was "forced" to leave town. https://t.co/k0M7V1dPQA
Pretty sure I would make a fabulous Shakespeare in a famous performance. If only someone would ask me. #realitybites
RT @billyeichner: .@BetsyDeVosED you are terrible
RT @AndyGaudion93: If Wes Craven directed The Goonies it would've looked a lot like #ITMovie - funny, sweet &amp; yes, scary.
I don't know which one is more inspirational @chancetherapper or @ChanceFrom79th 	Both are so uplifting! #positivitynow
@chancetherapper would make a better Secretary of Education than @BetsyDeVosED https://t.co/Xsax48jpnI
Anyone wonder what would have happened if Bernie was presidential candidate in the last candidate? He might not have won, but who knows?
I can't stand when people say it is all going to be okay. It never is all okay, and even if it is, telling me doesn't help.  #AHSCult
Anyone hear House of Cards during the title sequence of this season of #AHSCult ?
Sooo, yep, I still hate kale. #notreallyfood
I think every movie theater experience should be accompanied by a cold beer. Which is why I plan to build a movie theater in my garage.
@TheRickyDavila Thank you. Thank you.
@LPizzle I can play tambourine.
@christinawilkie Thanks? Like what did he mean? Thanks for showing me how good people act? Trump is a ridiculous little man, that happens to be president.
All the babies being made in Westeros! #GameOfThrones
People moving so much faster from place to place now. Did they construct a new King's Interstate to replace the King's road? #GameOfThrones
If only they could have thrown him out the Moon Door.  #GameOfThrones
Bend the knee to the Queen in the North whose name is Sansa Stark! #GameOfThrones
I am truly starting to believe castrated men do make better fighters.  #GameOfThrones
@BrokenRegal108 He has always been the smartest sibling.
Smart Tyrion! She will never do anything someone tells her to do, especially you. Good reverse psychology! #GameofThrones
@WikipediaJah And how was Tommen her youngest when they been doing it all the times since he was born?
Seriously though, why didn't they cut him in half before putting him in the box. Easier to carry and safer all around. #GameofThrones
So that how it gonna be now, Cersei?  #GameofThrones
@TIME Why the "almost?"
And I hate Puppy, Monkey, Baby with all my heart and soul.
Every time Trump makes a calm, reasonable speech:	1. Someone else wrote it	2. People realize the majority of what he says is deranged
There are two types of people in the world-the type that would sing along to Sweet Caroline like in the commercial and those that wouldn't.
@TheDailyShow Please let it be @BetsyDeVosED  Please let it be @BetsyDeVosED Please let it be @BetsyDeVosED Please let it be @BetsyDeVosED Please let it
Just watched an amazing episode of #GameOfThrones, then see Cornhole championship is on ESPN2. It is a rerun. This explains Trump's win.
So how do I get myself an army of white walkers? I have some chores they could help me with around the house.  #GameOfThrones
Boy, that hour went by fast! #GameOfThrones
She should have taken Tyrion with her. #GamesOfThrones
Look at both sides of Bannon leaving the White House. Now there is no chance we will ever get to see @Rosie play him on Saturday Night Live!
@ShaunKing @soledadobrien So beautiful, inside and out.
RT @Diane_7A: If Donald isn't haunted every night by the ghosts of former presidents, then why do we even have a White House?
RT @atDavidHoffman: Dear God, if you want us to impeach Trump, give us a sign. Like blot out the sun‚Ä¶  Anytime in the next week. Thanks, Am‚Ä¶
I believe it is a giant step forward for the LGBT movement that Adrian isn't the typical "saintly" gay teen portrayed on tv. #TheMist
Does that mean his other tweets are only posted after careful consideration? I don't think so. Or else he is even crazier than I thought. https://t.co/fZrpVlwhrF
Trump: "I don't want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement."
RT @jephjacques: If you‚Äôre mad that being photographed at a Nazi rally is ruining your life		maybe don‚Äôt be a nazi		you piece of shit
@thehill But he didn't. "Of course" he condemns them implies he actually did condemn them, which he didn't.
I am not an overly religious person, but we need prayers for our world. Peace and healing for planet Earth. I pray to the universe.
@JohnKasich You would have been so much better than @realDonaldTrump
After all the discontent you have sown, you ask us to come together as one? And you don't use an apostrophe in let's? Let's all vomit. https://t.co/UlmlV2G8WZ
Betsy DeVos in this article: We need to do the best things. Anything I said previously that you didn't like, you misunderstood. https://t.co/NQmXHdd78W
