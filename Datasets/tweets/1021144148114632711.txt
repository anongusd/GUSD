@matt_breen That's fine. However, get rid of him and make Wathan manager.
@Polls4MLB @Ken_Rosenthal the only way they won't make the playoffs is if they make no offseason moves whatsoever. If they sign Harper, Ramos, and Middle Infielder (Machado possibly) they are set.

The Phillies are done for this year. But next year, the Phillies will have lots of new additions to their team. Have fun "Chopping On" for now, @Braves. You'll be lucky if you even reach .500 next season.
Congrats, @Braves. We'll be waiting in Philadelphia on March 28th with Bryce Harper and possibly Manny Machado. See you then!
Whether or not the Braves clinch today, the Phillies focus should now be to get the young players in there as much as possible. They should also prepare for a BIG off-season.

@MrBrianKenny @jaysonst @enosarris @Joelsherman1 Scherzer is out of it. It's a two way race.  #Nola #DeGrom

Poll of the Day: Do you personally think Gabe Kapler has been a good fit for the Phillies?
Big win for the @Phillies last night! Let's try to win the series today! #BeBold #Phillies
For the Phillies to win the NL East they need to win 2/3, preferably 3/3 this weekend in New York. #BeBold

@NBCSPhilly @DPommellsNBCS @rickybottalico If it is a pitcher, Nola should win. If this award was just for position players, Javier Baez would get it almost without question.
@NBCSPhilly @rickybottalico @MBarkannNBCS I do have faith. This series in NY coming up is critical as the Braves are facing the D-Backs in Arizona. Hideout the Phillies can make some ground up.
