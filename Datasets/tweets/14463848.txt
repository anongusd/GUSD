@Cannibal_Sauce Hi - we think you're misunderstanding what we're saying. If you would like to read for yourself the ways you can help, you're welcome to check out our website: https://t.co/3VEOyCxYMg
@Cannibal_Sauce Hi - hunger is a complicated issue and children live with hunger for many reasons other than parental neglect. We invest in solutions that get kids the food they need where they live, learn and play so they can break free of the cycle of poverty.
@Istillwantapony @GenerationNKH Hi Rosie - this is a common response. No matter where you stand on birth control, the children who are hungry today have no control over their situations. We can be the change for them and that's what we choose to do! Having enough healthy food can change the cycle of poverty.

Children aren't just hungry in school, they're also hungry during summer when they don't have access to those meals.

@aydebravo11 Hi - this is a common misunderstanding. Making breakfast part of the school day enhances the educational well-being of a child as a whole. We've met teachers who use breakfast time as quiet time to do worksheets, read, take a pop quiz or learn lessons in responsibility!
@esodiegeiger Yes, yes, yes! When kids no longer worry about their next meal, there's so much more room in their lives to chase their dreams. That's why ending childhood hunger is so important!
@nadia_annn Hi Nads - we feel the same way and that's what this quote is getting at. Though breakfast has been proven to improve test scores, it also improves mood, behavior and a child's ability to ultimately chase his/her dreams.

@harold4766 @cspanwj That's actually one of the programs we're actively working on! Making school meals accessible plays a big role in the solution. It doesn't, however take place of SNAP. Kids aren't in school year round and on weekends so they don't always have access to those meals.
@whatgosround @airwolf1967 @cspanwj Thank you! There are a lot of people out there who don't believe in what we do. But for each of those people there are so many more who are actively working to end childhood hunger locally or nationally and that's what really matters in the fight!
@airwolf1967 @whatgosround @cspanwj There are lot of underlying problems and we have a track record of working on them. Problems like access, funding, transportation. We work on all of those! You can learn more about them here: https://t.co/QY4dVPlQl6
@airwolf1967 @whatgosround @cspanwj But we don't have to. We'd rather focus our time on growing young minds and filling young stomachs than on the few cases where parents are being irresponsible because that's where our dollars are most effective in completing our mission: feeding hungry kids.
@airwolf1967 @whatgosround @cspanwj We're going to continue to feed hungry kids whether they're hungry because of the rare situation of parental neglect or because they have parents who just got fired from their hourly job or someone's medical bill has put them in so much debt they can't always afford food.
@airwolf1967 @whatgosround @cspanwj So are we if we do nothing. So we're doing something. Kids aren't in control of their situations, and they need food. We work to get them that food. That's the whole reason we do what we do!
@airwolf1967 @whatgosround @cspanwj Punishing the child by making them go hungry will not end childhood hunger or punish the parents. So what we do is focus on the child so they have a chance at a bright future. You can disagree with our methods, we'll keep feeding hungry kids!
@airwolf1967 @whatgosround @cspanwj We want kids to be fed. Continuing to make them struggle with hunger which has proven consequences in school and the rest of their lives has been proven to not help.
@airwolf1967 @whatgosround @cspanwj So why would we add to that by continuing to make them go hungry? Our answer: we won't. That's why we feed them where they live, learn and play regardless of the reason they are struggling with hunger because they aren't in control of their situations.
@airwolf1967 @whatgosround @cspanwj What you're saying is an assumption. There are many parents who have trouble making ends meet that are doing their best. Meet Natasha, one of the parents you are talking about. She is an example of most of the parents using SNAP: https://t.co/4S4cDPGD0y
@airwolf1967 @whatgosround @cspanwj We can't measure "stupidity" but we can measure that there are 13 million children who live with hunger in the U.S. Blaming people or systems won't work. Feeding kids has been proven to so that's what we do!
@airwolf1967 @whatgosround @cspanwj You can't know what that person is going through by looking at them and it's important to remember that your personal experience isn't reflective of the national average. In that situation, if that person's child is hungry, it is not the child's fault and they still deserve food.
@airwolf1967 @whatgosround @cspanwj It isn't fair to assume that children are going hungry because of parental neglect. Hunger is a  complicated issue and there are many reasons children experience hunger. Regardless of the reason there is never a GOOD reason which is why we work to feed all children.
@harold4766 @cspanwj Hi Harry - we work to feed all children in America. Where they're from or their immigration status is unimportant. What is important is that they're our future and they deserve a shot at a healthy, bright one.
@lan_denunzio @cspanwj @lisadavis Hi Lan - we're a 501c3 nonprofit and we work with food banks across the country to ensure kids have enough food each day. Stealing from food banks and food programs is not our model and we take a big picture approach to ending childhood hunger that involves a lot of people!
@ctyankee007 @cspanwj Teachers are superheroes, you're right! And they're under a lot of pressure these days. Breakfast in the classroom has been proven to help them actually. When kids are fed as a part of the school day, they are better able to concentrate and be better members of the classroom.
@lan_denunzio @cspanwj @lisadavis Hi Lan - our findings indicate otherwise! Around 50 percent of people who benefit from SNAP are children. It's an important program to fill the gaps where they would otherwise experience hunger.
@airwolf1967 @whatgosround @cspanwj Did you know that around 50 percent of people who benefit from SNAP are children? The program is more complicated than the government paying people each month. It actually helps kids get the food they need to succeed.

@lanewalton It's all of our responsibility to make sure kids have a fighting chance at a bright future - that much is true!
@nancymck1211 Here are 5 things to know about #PublicCharge that we think will help clear up the confusion: https://t.co/oj8lJKu5Uy
@lanewalton Nope! That's not what we're saying at all. What we are saying is that kids deserve enough healthy food to be successful no matter the reason they are experiencing hunger and we think that's something all of us as Americans can agree on.
@pickles_couger A lot of the families we're talking about are families experiencing some of the same struggles you are. Our solution is to get kids three meals a day regardless of why they're hungry so they have a fighting chance at a bright future. We should all want that for kids.
.@ChefJasRoberts has it right. The proposed #PublicCharge rule will hurt children and families legally here in America. He's taking a stand against it. You can too at the link below 👇 https://t.co/uTLIKSpvx7
@RubYaWrong If you've been there, then you know it's never the child's fault and they shouldn't be punished by going hungry. We do the work we do so they have a fighting chance at a bright future. We think that's something everyone should be able to agree upon.

@MieczynskyjT Hi TJ - there are many ways to help kids living with hunger that don't involve taxes. Here are a few ideas for how to get involved: https://t.co/3VEOyCxYMg
@MithrasAlma Hi Mithras - we believe that we all have a role to play in ending childhood hunger. If we want to build a strong future, we must start by helping kids that are living with hunger access the food they need to grow up healthy and strong. There are so many ways we can all help.
@RubYaWrong Hi there - Many hard-working American families are living right on the edge of poverty – one job cutback or medical emergency means they are no longer able to afford the food their kids need.  Poverty and parental responsibility are complex issues, but feeding a child is not.
Childhood hunger is a problem we KNOW how to solve. Thank you to our friends at @TedMontanaGrill for helping to connect kids to 1.5 million meals during Dine Out this year! #HungerCantWait https://t.co/uhQHgByMz3

@Sky_Masters737 Sounds great, you're entitled to your opinion. We'll just keep ending childhood hunger over here 👍
@Sky_Masters737 You're welcome to vote whatever way you choose. As a 501c3 nonprofit, we are a bipartisan organization and while we think it's important to vote, we will never tell you HOW to. We will, however, stand against policies that will hurt kids which #PublicCharge certainly does.
@Sky_Masters737 Obesity and hunger are actually related because of the cost of healthy food, but that's a little off topic. What we're really talking about here is the children of legal immigrants who would suffer because of #PublicCharge. You are welcome to read more: https://t.co/oj8lJKu5Uy

@NCshopgirl Hi Di - actually that's a common misconception. The issue isn't that there are too many kids to feed because we live in a great nation with great resources. It's that kids don't always have access to those resources. That's why we do the work we do!

@Chefjernard @ATLairport We LOVE your passion! Thank you for sharing it with hungry kids!
@nasser_nakhaee We definitely agree! Our campaign is laser focused on children in the U.S. but that doesn't mean that hunger throughout the world isn't a problem! In fact, our parent organization Share Our Strength focuses more broadly on hunger and poverty.
The weeks after an election provide an opportunity for elected officials, staffers and the media to set new priorities for districts, states and the country.

@GaryZPon @secupp @pbcsd Hi Gary - Feeding all the kids living with hunger in the world is something that we would like to aid in achieving one day. Until then, we're committed to connecting all kids living with hunger in America to the meals they need to grow up healthy and strong.
@DARLA_1 Hi Darlene - those things are wonderful, helpful lifelines for sure! However, accessibility can be an issue - depending on where folks live, their income, and other things that may disqualify them from such benefits.

@AlyR @billshore Thank you for your support, Aly! We appreciate you!
@GaryZPon @secupp @pbcsd Hi Gary - Immigration is a complex issue, but feeding a child is not. We’re really focused on ensuring that all kids in the U.S. who need a healthy meal can get one. Regardless of anyone’s personal opinions, children shouldn’t be penalized by getting stuck in the cycle of hunger.
@DARLA_1 Hi Darlene - Many hard-working American families are living right on the edge of poverty – one job cutback or medical emergency means they are no longer able to afford the food their kids need. Poverty is a complex issue, but feeding a child is not.
@RobertInNJ @Grubhub Thanks so much, Robert!

@triballawyer Hi Leslie - this is just one photo we've used in our ads. There are 13 million kids who lives with hunger in the US.
@lhviera Unfortunately, that is all too often. Which is why school meal programs are part of the solution to ensure every child has what they need to succeed.

@dornmachine @andrewzimmern Uh oh, you may not have read our post correctly. Obesity &amp; hunger are not mutually exclusive like you said before. Not all obese people are hungry, not all hungry people are obese, but there is overlap in the categories and it is in part due to a lack of healthy choices.
@joeDmarti Thanks for standing with us, Joe! You're so right, kids rely on us to get the food they need. Voting matters!

@dornmachine @andrewzimmern Did you know that obesity, hunger and poverty are all linked? When the only affordable food is highly processed and unhealthy, kids can be both obese and hungry. It's something we can change though by making sure all kids have access to enough healthy food to grow and thrive.

@aydebravo11 @RobertDowneyJr Hi - this is a common concern, but many studies say otherwise! When kids are full, they're more ready to learn and teachers have used breakfast in the classroom time as part of the instructional day for reading, writing, worksheets or other activities!

@DoreenRudolph3 Doreen - thank you for sharing your story. Did you know about summer meals sites? There are sites where kids 18 and under can get free meals no registration of ID required. It's heartbreaking when families have to make decisions like this which is why we do the work we do!

@tomzingie Hi Thomas - it's not fair to assume that parents do not want to feed their children. Hunger is complicated and you can't know what each child may be going through based on what you see. School meals are a great way to reach hungry kids for whatever reason they are hungry.

I've roamed and rambled and I followed my footsteps 	To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts; 	And all around me a voice was sounding: 	This land was made for you and me.	https://t.co/BICyRgYdNg #4thOfJuly2018 https://t.co/xoVc9MRS76
As I was walking that ribbon of highway, 	I saw above me that endless skyway: 	I saw below me that golden valley: 	This land was made for you and me.	https://t.co/BICyRgYdNg #4thOfJuly2018 https://t.co/zxJYZmJfv4
This land is your land, This land is my land	From California to the New York island; 	From the red wood forest to the Gulf Stream waters 	This land was made for you and Me.	https://t.co/BICyRgYdNg #4thOfJuly2018 https://t.co/cU9v9D32ji

@DesireeResists @fractweets Hi Desiree - if you won't read the report, then I guess we're going to have to agree to disagree here because it's unlikely we'll see eye to eye. We appreciate your concern for kids and about the language we use when we talk about the work we do. Thank you for your concern.
@DesireeResists @fractweets We're glad to have passionate people like you on our team and we agree - people in poverty have a steep hill to climb. That's why we do the work we do. If you're interested in learning more, you can do that on our website here: https://t.co/Xi53406PPv
@DesireeResists @fractweets Hi Desiree - it looks like you may not have read the report. There weren't numbers in our original tweet, and we aren't lying - hunger is a huge factor when it comes to retaining information over the summer. We know that based on reports like the one we sent your way!
Thank you @FlavaFraz21 and @Citi for joining us in the fight against childhood hunger! Ride on. #CitiHRs https://t.co/M66dnfe3xJ

@wiener_dr This commentary is sad, but there's hope in it too. We are proud to have a community of game-changers who work tirelessly to make sure all children get the food they need to grow up healthy and strong. We believe if everyone lends a hand, we can end childhood hunger in America.
