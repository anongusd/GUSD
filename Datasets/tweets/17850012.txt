@ScottMonty heh. some of them are. a lot aren't. It's silly they're going out of their way to call last couple of weeks un-moblike. I've seen mobs. I've covered mobs. That was a mob.
Since the media seems to get their feelers hurt by calling the leftist mob a mob, instead of mainstream media, why not call them the mob media, since they were in it with the protesters of Kavanaugh from the outset? #MobMedia
@macphisto96 If he perjured himself and it were proven in court, yes. It's also a hypothetical that will never happen. You have now gone from he absolutely lied to if he lied, then... Just because you think he did does not make it so. innocent until proven guilty.
@macphisto96 Think what you want. I'm comfortable with Constitutional order and rule of law on my side.
@macphisto96 I have compromised nothing, sir. There is no corroboration against him. Dr. Ford made the allegations. She cited her corroborating witnesses. All have responded under oath. Zero corroborated. One claimed witnesses tampering.
@macphisto96 You can't differentiate between theft and gang rape? Seriously? no difference in your book between theft and drugging and gang raping women? Wow, nice moral compass you have there.
@macphisto96 Oh, and by the way, my scenario isn't even fair, because you theoretically would know the attack is coming. Kavanaugh didn't. Not to that degree.
@macphisto96 Let's try a thought experiment. Let me and all my friends on Twitter call you a gang rapist 24/7 online for 10 days and have you just take it. Let us all attack your family for 10 days and you just take it. And after 10 days, then you get a chance to speak. You up for that?

@macphisto96 @EdMorrissey House Democrats may try and impeach him to pacify their political base. But he will not be disbarred. You're simply not in a position to know what you're talking about.
@macphisto96 @EdMorrissey not one witness Dr. Ford claimed could corroborate her story did under oath to either the Senate Judiciary Committee or the FBI. In fact, one of Ford's corroborating witnesses claimed to the FBI she was coerced by Ford's legal team to change her story. That's witness tampering.
@macphisto96 @EdMorrissey Bill Clinton lied to a grand jury on videotape. That was not only adjudicated in the House with impeachment, he also lost his law license afterwards in court as a direct result. The case literally was made against him. no hypocrisy. Weep bitter tears, friend.
@macphisto96 @EdMorrissey Bottom line is you are committing slander. He did no such thing. You may want to believe he did, and you are entitled to your belief. You have no legal case behind your belief.
@AdrienneRoyer Oh, I know it's not over. But the imminent threat has passed. We literally could have just witnessed the end of the republic if Collins had gone the other way.
@BillRobertson08 @mikebarnicle I think you're missing the irony of Mike's tweet.
@benshapiro I was told there would be no math.
@mikebarnicle So just to clarify, we're not to listen and believe women when they speak up?
Now Sen. Collins is taking Dianne Feinstein behind the woodshed. Go, girl, go. I have never heard Collins this way before. Ever.
The bottom line here is the United States just survived a near-fatal attack of McCarthyism again. Thank you, Senator Collins. Thank you, Senate Republicans, except for Lisa Murkowski. Good man, wrong time sounds pretty pathetic now in retrospect, doesn't it?
Yes, you can kid the theater and the drama and the length of Sen. Collins' speech. It is a masterful exposition of rule of law in this country. And the depth of first principles on display here makes it really, really hard for Joe Manchin to follow up and say nah, I'm out.

@AynRiedel98 That’s my choice in this state. Feinstein needs to be punished for her disgraceful conduct.
Senator Feinstein crying crocodile tears over not being allowed to question witnesses, while simultaneously ordering her staff on Judiciary for weeks to boycott the investigation for fear of legitimizing it and undermining calls for FBI.
As you listen to this she’ll of a former influential senator, remember that to date, there is still zero, none, zip corroboration of Dr. Ford’s claim, not even by witnesses Ford cited.
Thank you, Dianne Feinstein, for giving me the unique ability to gladly vote for a Democrat for the first and hopefully only time in my life. You are a disgrace. Kevin de Leon has my vote.
Democrats now walking out of Committee, to the glee of the photographers, who are now interrupting the hearing.
Kamala Harris, ladies and gentlemen. My junior senator is now personalizing a Democratic hissy fit on the Judiciary Committee into her own silent protest.

@wphamilton There are no facts with an FBI investigation. There is no evidence. All sides involved have issued sworn statements under penalty of perjury. What are you expecting? FBI waterboarding to commence? All statements are known. It's her memory v. all other denials.
Amy Klobuchar trying again with the FBI investigation comparison to Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas. Both Hill and Thomas were federal employees. FBI is brought in by definition in that instance. 36 year old allegation between minors? FBI investigation? Not their job, and she knows it
The Dems still insist on getting Kavanaugh to delay this circus further by calling for an FBI investigation. The Senate Judiciary Committee has staff, both sides, who have subpoena power. They run investigations all the time. Dem side not cooperating at all. Argument is farcical.
@wphamilton Because the left is now demanding investigation for five instances that have been cooked up, with multiple nutty witnesses to depose. that will take well after November to depose and write up. The Dems do not want a vote until after November. Period. That's all this is about.
Lindsey Graham just dropped the mic. He just gave voice, fiercely so, to what is really going on here. And it's not about vetting or advice or consent.
This is so clearly self-evident. This entire charade has never been about what may or may not have happened to Blasey Ford. An FBI investigation will take months. The Dems do not want to flatten their base turnout by having Dems vote for Kavanaugh in Trump states. https://t.co/SdqkQ1izNl

@davidhogg111 So I guess the NY Times walking back their deceptive story, admitting Obama administration is who ordered/paid for drapes, doesn't impact your screed any? No walk back or apology from you for piling on? Part of growing up is owning your mistakes.
Dear Lord, please bring back the Teleprompter of the United States. I know I mocked its usage when Obama relied on it heavily, but when Donald Trump describes Florence as tremendously big and tremendously wet, the prompter needs 24/7 attention. https://t.co/qC7iW8xFt8
If Donald Trump wanted to turn the tables from a bad week last week, he'd announce he's moving resources in place to recover from Florence in the Carolinas today.

@reluctantzealot I stand by it. If you can't see the satire in it, that's your problem, not mine. The left came after Ron DeSantis with derision and cries of racism about Andrew Gillum for exactly the same rhetoric Biden used towards Obama and received a pass.
@jrussell264 That's you're, moron.
@partisan39 thanks, william. really wasn't sure where i was going with that, but just went with it. Glad you were listening.
It's stunning to me that no one is outraged that racist Joe Biden gave a keynote eulogy for John McCain, tainting the entire event, and no one is bothered by it. After all, racist Joe Biden once referred to Barack Obama as "clean and articulate." That's racist, right, lefties?

Touchdown in Aspen at last. Third time’s the charm.
Today, we learn if a commercial flight of 27 minutes can take place, complete with luggage, on a major national air carrier.
My thanks to @EdMorrissey for coming in and hosting on essentially no notice. You are a good man and a fine scholar. And thanks to Steve and the crew at @1280ThePatriot for making the studio available there. @united is very lucky to have you both be pros.
She said it was already late leaving, it can be a few more minutes late. That’s the spirit, I said. Off to bed. Will I get to Aspen? Will my luggage? Will I be wearing Marty Robbins’ boxers? Who knows? @united is as reliable as a Trump press conference.
It was all I could do not to ask for clarification down in the West Texas town of El Paso? Was Marty Robbins’ name on the luggage tag? I didn’t say it, but don’t think I didn’t think it. She very quietly told him bad things would happen if someone  didn’t stop that plane.
She reached luggage control. Could you track these two bags? I can’t see them on my screen for some reason. Her smile faded. I could the other end of the conversation. I know why her smile faded. He said they’re aboard the plane going to El Paso. Oh, dear God, no, Susan said.
Now for the fun part. I smiled again. Susan, would you be so kind as to track my two bags? It’s not that I don’t trust you, it’s just that I don’t trust @United. She smiled. Of course, I can check. That can’t be a problem, right? She climbed on the phone, still with the smile.
Yes, weather played a role the second time, but there would not have been a second time without the mechanical first. She shared that, and the fact I did radio, to her supervisor. Enjoy your hotel voucher was the next sentence I heard.
I smiled. Honestly, I did. I said Susan, this isn’t your fault, and I’m not taking this out on you, but that is horse excrement and you and I both know it. I would be in Aspen and not here bitching you out were it not for a gauge on the dash that went out forcing us to turn back.
...I told her that once we get back on the air speaking to millions of people, it wasn’t going to look good for ol’ @united. She got me rebooked, gave me meal vouchers, but was going to stick me with the hotel, saying they’re not responsible for weather.
So you’ll be amazed to learn that I reached the front of the line at @United’s ‘customer service’ counter, and naturally, my situation was beyond this young man’s abilities. He passed me off to Susan, who knew what she was doing. She took over and stepped up her game when...
@varifrank I’m not mad at the pilot or the crew. The United ground crew in the hub leaves a lot to be desired.
@ConservativeLA Now they dm’d asking for patience. Getting caught flat-footed at your freaking hub is inefficient. Patience runs out after an incomplete 109 mile flight that sill apparently take 19 hours.
My guess is this will be me talking about @United if and when I ever get to sleep tonight. https://t.co/WZatBX7YHa
United dm’d me just now. Pith of the gist was sorry about the weather, glad you’re rebooked, have you gone to customer service, yet about a hotel. Guess they haven’t read the tweet feed they responded to. *sigh*
@varifrank @Hertz Negative. Windy mountain road the whole way. 3 hours plus, and that’s if I can ever get to the front of this line and retrieve my bags.
On the plus side, though, all this time in line allows me to collect my thoughts and catch up on my tweeting. Thanks, @united.
Look, @united, I get that to you, ‘customer service’ is a term of art you do not mean, but you had over an hour notice that this flight wasn’t going to reach its destination and that you’d have to scramble. Did you? Heck no. Scramble? At your hub? Throw more bodies at it? Nah.
I hope this flea trap they’re putting me up in has room service, because I’m ordering one of everything.
Still in line for a rat trap hotel voucher for a room I don’t want in a city in which I do wish to spend the night with no change of clothes. But at least the pilot didn’t augur in coming back to Denver. Right decent of him, although to be fair, he’d had plenty of practice today.
@alibertarian 16 hours maybe?
@alibertarian 3.5 hours. Windy mountain road all the way
@joshuasharf @photog357 I still would need my bags. Still stuck in an interminable line.
I told her where she can go. God won’t hold that against me. I’m sure of it. Got to customer service at gate 39...along with three different flights’ worth of unhappy campers. Disneyland lines move faster.
So we’re not even trying again tonight, I ask? Nope. Go to customer service at B56. Forgive my math, but that’s 34 gates away. Ran. Old. Panting. Huff. Hello, puff, customer service agent, I wheezed. Gate 39 is where you need to go.
Dear @united, you suck. I flew in for the third time to Denver. Gate B90. You couldn’t seem to make a successful 109 mile flight to Aspen after two attempts. What about my bags, which have my radio broadcast gear I need tonight? Oh, it’ll be on the flight we try again at 11AM.
Oh, and by the way, @photog357, I don’t ever have to abort attempts to land in California. Just sayin’.
I never tire of flying into Denver Airport, said no one ever. Good thing we had the extra gas. We burned it circling aspen waiting for the wind to die down. They didn’t. Back in Denver for the 3rd time today.
So after loading more gas to go around bad weather, we now think we can get there using straight route, meaning we didn’t need the extra gas. So when we crash in aspen due to wind shear, the fireball will be spectacular.
So we took off 22 minutes ago from Denver to head to  Aspen. 3/4 of the way there, they decided we couldn’t make it all the way there with our current equipment. Talked politics with my seat mate the whole time, not realizing we turned around. My first aerial joyride. https://t.co/x1QSJMAacl

The Democrats and their MSM accomplices have so totally overplayed their hand about how doom is nigh with this pick that when Trump actually announces him/her and the left explodes anew, no one outside the Dem base will believe them. It’s Chicken Liberal Little in real time.
@_the__hawk Wouldn’t that confirmation hearing be quite the spectacle?
@SumErgoMonstro The flaw in your logic is that any justice worthy of being the nominee wouldn’t permit themselves to be used as a shell game prop.
This is how it will leak out. Whomever the nominee is going to be, someone will see him/her either get into a car and the car will be tracked by media to the White House, or someone will spot the nominee in the White House and leak it out. We'll know within the hour. https://t.co/yGOn4DeQRy

The EO would about a month before the midterms, and would give Republicans in vulnerable red states currently being represented by Dems a winning campaign issue down the stretch. Also gives McConnell a chance to squeeze Democrats during August recess that's now been cancelled.
For the next three months, the President has the ability to remind voters that Democrats are not interested in doing their job of legislating, only want to demagogue. He can say he's only buying time to let the Congress do their job.
Sign that executive order but put an expiration on it. Make it a 90 day EO. This gives a cooling off period, takes the club Democrats and media are wielding, and places the club in the President's hands.
So this whole border/children/detention issue that Axios reports is boxing in Donald Trump seems like a very easy issue the President can turn on Democrats. Here's how: Pick between either the Cruz or Cotton proposal and craft an executive order adopting it.
@CrankyTRex @EdMorrissey Look, I want inspections to happen. I hope they do happen. That will be a de-escalation order of magnitude that is worthy of praise. I'm just saying that if one is that paranoid, it's hard for me to believe they're going to cooperate with inspections.

@RealConserva @hughhewitt @FCC Hugh was referring to me as a terrible umpire, not the ones in the clip. Everything about me, Hugh believes to be terrible.
@JSant24 @hughhewitt @FCC what fascinated me about it was richie garcia saying his ass was in the jackpot if they let Syndergaard get away with it, meaning MLB is micromanaging how the umps call games. That's really bad, if true. There is a remedy for fixing bad umping. This isn't it.
As a fan, I love having umps mic'd up. As an ump, I hate it. If it were me in this situation, I'd be less inclined to say anything to anybody. https://t.co/uh4ycgvXMc
So to me, all of this is either bluster or real. No one, including Trump, knows which right now. If there are real inspections in a matter of months, it's real. If not, Trump's been had. Time will tell soon enough. Everyone's predictions now are just pro or anti-Trump bias.

@verbaluce Disney was very appropriate in canceling her show. Her comments are indefensible. My point is it doesn't speak well of ABC's programming decisions or vetting process. They dumped a ratings winner for rolling the dice on someone who on her best day is very controversial.
@verbaluce No whataboutism at all. I'm not defending Roseanne by saying others do worse. I'm not sure you know what the terms mean. I never watched her show. Wasn't hostile to it. I thought at the time, and still do, that Disney made a mistake flushing Last Man Standing for this reboot.
So, ABC, I guess in retrospect, that whole Roseanne for Last Man Standing wasn't the best roster move you've made, is it? I'm pretty sure Bill Maher is available for a sitcom, too, but I wouldn't go with that, either.

@KDugovich It's real simple. Article 1 says Congress writes the laws, not Obama executive orders. Trump was trying to return the process to Constitutional order. Congress can and should fix DACA. Using courts to uphold Obama action is lawless.

I'm sure I can go back and find when David Gregory said Bill Clinton decided the rule of law didn't matter after he pardoned Marc Rich. I'm sure he was consistent. Got to be here somewhere.  https://t.co/LvAKajZdCb via @mediaite
@roseserao Never said that. Trump's pardon is clearly controversial. Just noting the double standard the left seems to have when it comes to what should happen if one lies to a grand jury. Libby served time. Clinton did not.
@Poppie_field Lying to a grand jury is lying to a grand jury. The target of the investigation, which was to discover who leaked Valerie Plame, never resulted in justice for who actually did it - Richard Armitage. Special Counsels don't often go where they're aimed.
@llamain5os i never said that. Libby lied to a grand jury. price had to be paid. He served time. Just pointing out that Bill Clinton was above the law. he lied to a grand jury, did not get prosecuted, even after his presidency.
The pardon is clearly controversial, and the merits can be debated. But in that debate, one has to also admit that senior people at DOJ and FBI at least appeared to break the law, too. They shouldn't be immune from scrutiny, criticism or possible prosecution as well.
Bill Clinton committed perjury. It cost him his law license. Any other American who would have done what Clinton did would have served time. Did Trump pardon Libby to send a message to overreaching special prosecutors that inevitably run far afield from their original charge? Yes
Why would anyone care what Joe Wilson and Valerie Plame think of the pardon of Scooter Libby? It wasn't Libby who leaked the identity of Ms. Plame. That would be Richard Armitage. Libby, if memory serves, did time for lying to a grand jury. How much time did Bill Clinton serve?

@saneman3000 @Fallenbelle2 1. when have liberals ever been concerned about cost? 2. what's the liability concern when a school does get shot up and a decision was made preemptively not to provide the added layer of defense?
@Fallenbelle2 who is saying this is compulsory? If you wish not to participate, that's fine. If there are teachers that are willing to do just that, why do you seek to prevent them from that? Your will should supercede the decision making of other teachers?
@Quigs8816 @Fallenbelle2 @ReaganBattalion my guess is part of the training will be how weapons are secured/accessed. Israel figured out how to do it. I'm sure we can as well.
@DanielsKrystin @Fallenbelle2 @ReaganBattalion and that's perfectly fine. There will be lots of teachers who do not want to do this. it will never be mandatory. but if some are willing, able and take training, nothing but upside if you're worried about defending students.
@Quigs8816 @Fallenbelle2 @ReaganBattalion 2/2 if you're scenario plays out, the shooter is busy going after an armed teacher rather than shooting up dozens of kids. While this time is going on, other armed response is on the way, if schools have more guards. You're actually helping me make my case.
@Quigs8816 @Fallenbelle2 @ReaganBattalion it's training. they're either going to qualify or they won't. This really isn't a hard concept. You're assuming that a shooter/student will go into a school, not start shooting, go into a classroom, go after a teacher they see armed, and overpower them. 1/2
@Fallenbelle2 @ReaganBattalion then don't volunteer or take training. My guess is there will be at least one teacher at your school who will gladly train and volunteer to carry. Arming teachers is not compulsory, you know.

@TechYT4000 quick, someone tell VetTech he's an idiot, because the Senate has this filibuster rule where not budget motions require 60 votes.
@dwdeardorff @hughhewitt yup. everything in the grassley bill included stuff Dems were for as late as 2013. They are now against it because they believe they can make political hay out of it simply because Trump was for it. It's a mind-numbingly stupid strategy. The country wanted this. It made sense.
The Grassley bill being voted on right now is the only path to citizenship for 1.8 million people Democrats purportedly tried to shut the government down over, and yet the only reason it will fail is solely because Democrats say no to what they say they want.
They will try deflect any way possible, but the Democrats are right now saying no to 1.8 DACA eligible people, no to border security, no to merit-based visas, and no to ending 3rd cousin twice removed chain migration. Why? No other reason than their loathing of Trump.
Dear Dreamers &amp; voting citizens who care about the DACA issue, ask yourself this question. Why would you still support the Democratic Party who walked away from legislation that makes you whole in this country in return for issues Democrats have previously supported?

@ConservativeLA pretty cool, eh?
@gamurgis So again, you're now admitting that most Republicans voted the right way, which is exactly the opposite of your original point. The answer is quantity of Republicans. Quantity is a quality all its own.
@gamurgis that's actually not true. most republicans wanted to in the House. Most wanted to in the Senate, four Republicans and every Democrat in the Senate didn't. So you're factually not accurate. Answer is 70 Republicans to get a net 60 to make it so.
The solution to all this is two-fold - more Republicans in the Senate and a return to the original purpose of the filibuster. Restore it so that all Senators have a say on any legislation. Once they've spoken, time to vote. It was never meant to be a one-Senator pocket veto.
For those who are concerned, as I am, about the debt/deficits, this deal doesn't help in that regard. It spends too much money. It is not, however, the driving factor on debt/deficits. Entitlements are, something House GOP passed last year. Dems killed in the Senate.
The Democrats in the Senate shut the government down last month in order to try and get DACA amnesty. This budget deal takes that leverage away from them. The deal - regularization for Dreamers for wall/border security will happen. Has to. Only a matter of time now.
The Democrats agreed to, unbelievably to me, to do away with the IPAB boards, another chunk from Obamacare that will continue to weaken and erode it. And if you are a person who believes we need a wall as part of a responsible border security strategy, that's now more likely.
For the first time since Barack Obama's hairbrained mandate of 1-1 spending - $1 of domestic spending for every $1 of Defense spending, something that has no logic, reason, or Constitutional necessity, that's now gone. Majority of this budget spending goes to military build-up.
The long and the short of this 2 year budget deal, for grown-ups. Yes, it spends way too much money. Yes, it weakens the GOP's argument of being the fiscally responsible party. I get all that. But there is plenty in here in which to make the case why we have to do it.
@photog357 I honestly expected more than I got. This seems so obvious to me. Pragmatism seems like a lost art these days.
And the House adjourns after voting to keep the government open while details of the 2 year budget deal are worked out. 239-187. Follows a relatively easy vote, once they beat Rand Paul down with their shoes in the Senate, 71-28.

@JohnDouglasFord The FISC isn't a normal court somewhere, nor should the standard for a surveillance warrant be that lax.
@JohnDouglasFord I'm not trashing the FBI. I'm saying whoever handled this FISA warrant at the Bureau may very well have commited malfeasance. And it could turn out to be worse.
@JohnDouglasFord At best, the Bureau used an unverified document to get a FISA warrant to spy on an American citizen. At worst, one political campaign coordinated with the Bureau to get a warrant using a document they paid for in order to spy on their opponent.
@JohnDouglasFord So has Rep. Gowdy, and he says it wasn't. So there you go.
@ConservativeLA gowdy read the source docs. gowdy and nunes wrote the summary memo.
@JohnDouglasFord If there was good reason, why wasn't it presented honestly to the FISC? Why did the FBI have to commit sin of omission and weasel a warrant out of the FISA court?
@jasondowney1981 The memo says the warrant would not have been sought without the dossier. either the transcript will back that up or it won't. If that stands, I'm not slanting anything. warrant was sought using known unverified/biased dossier without disclosure to the FISC. That's malfeasance.
@guypbenson I know that's what you meant. I'm just hypersensitive on clarity today.
@guypbenson guy, not to pick a nit, but just correcting what you responded. I understand the caution about what exactly McCabe testified. But you said warrant isn't sought with dossier information. memo actually said warrant is not sought without  dossier information. big difference.
Well, this should be easy enough to resolve, shouldn't it? McCabe did testify to the committee in December of 2017. that was only 2 months ago. Pretty easy to go back to the transcript, even if it was in closed session. https://t.co/EdYDakBkrU

@KTS68386138 @kayla10x @ezraklein and lying by omission is still a lie.
@caminvan Andrew McCabe testifed to Congress that the FISA warrant wouldn't have been sought without the dossier. The dossier, at the time of the warrant, was known to be a political document with direct ties to Bruce Ohr back at FBI through his wife. None of that was disclosed to FISC.
@kayla10x @KTS68386138 @ezraklein Keep trying. Andrew McCabe testified that no warrant would have been sought without the dossier. The dossier was already understood to be a political document, not evidence, used it anyway without divulging the bias to the FISA court.
@caminvan If the memo in your hypothetical stated that the FBI scammed the FISA court to get a warrant to spy on an American citizen, and then hid actions from Congressional oversight, I'd want those FBI-DOJ agents held accountable.
@kayla10x @KTS68386138 @ezraklein If Carter Page is your neighbor who you see shoot someone, police respond immediately in the commission of a crime. Irrelevant analogy. FBI used a political campaign-funded report to get a warrant to go fishing without telling the court warrant request was politically motivated.
@THECJBelleville @PigBearBull @ezraklein The FBI wouldn't have sought the FISA warrant without the dossier. The FBI chose four times to avoid telling the FISC the dossier was a partisan enterprise paid for by the DNC/Clinton administration. The warrant was obtained unethically to spy on an American citizen.
@THECJBelleville @PigBearBull @ezraklein McCabe testified to Congress that without the dossier, which had been accepted by the Bureau to be tainted, they would not have sought a FISA warrant on Page. The warrant to spy on an American citizen was obtained/renewed three times on false pretenses.
RT @stephenfhayes: Also, having read the memo twice, I'm still looking for the info that led to the hysteria from Democrats about the memo…
@jpodhoretz It would have had to be, wouldn't it? My guess is hopefully @bretbaier asks Nunes that tonight.
@stephenfhayes I would agree largely with what you conclude. Only exception would be that Rosenstein signing off on Page FISA warrants 4 times clouds his credibility. Probably best to recuse and allow Rachel Brand to oversee Mueller from here on out.
@CatrionaMDW @PigBearBull @ezraklein without the dossier, they wouldn't have sought the warrant in the first place. That's what McCabe testifed to. They wouldn't have made the attempt.
@morty_menson @ezraklein Good luck holding onto that.
@crashfrog @kayla10x @ezraklein They admitted it was biased and unreliable.
@CatrionaMDW @PigBearBull @ezraklein Then I don't know how to have a conversation with you if you read what McCabe testified and then tweeted what you tweeted. It's exactly 180 degrees off.
@kayla10x @ezraklein No, i'm saying that the FBI by not divulging to the FISC that the material isn't that reliable, and hiding that analysis from the court three more times on renewals, shows that they figured the court wouldn't have granted the warrant without them fudging.
@CatrionaMDW @PigBearBull @ezraklein You didn't read the memo. Andrew McCabe testified to Congress that they wouldn't have sought the warrant without the dossier. It was the engine in their investigatory car.
@Drivedabizness 1. minimum action would be Rod Rosenstein has to recuse and Rachel Brand takes over oversight of Mueller. 2. Someone at DOJ not involved at all in this has to investigate McCabe-Ohr-Comey-Rosenstein-dossier-FISA affair. If not someone at DOJ, separate special counsel.
@THECJBelleville @PigBearBull @ezraklein I don't know that to be true. Do you?
@ropebelt @PigBearBull @ezraklein I'm not saying Carter Page is a saint. He is an American citizen who apparently had a surveillance warrant obtained on him without justifiable cause. But please, continue to defend that.
@morty_menson @ezraklein Now how is it exactly you know Page had been under surveillance since 2013? Was he under a FISC-authorized surveillance for those three years? It admits it was renewed 3 times, all without divulging to the FISC their primary source for the ask was known to be bogus. That's fraud.
@PigBearBull @ezraklein Andrew McCabe, number two at FBI then, testified to Congress that no warrant would have been sought without the memo that had previously been deemed by the Bureau to be biased and discredited. If you can't see that as a scam, I have a rich Nigerian uncle...
@Mattfobrien Then if we catch them in an at of impropriety, the answer should never be 'meh'. The answer should be to hold them accountable.
@caminvan Nonsense. I read the memo. Have you? I fully stated that we haven't seen the Democrat response memo or FBI response. I'm fully willing to consider them. So far, this is damning.
@CPLiebau That's the impact to the Mueller investigation. I'm okay with Mueller, per se. But it seems impossible to trust Rosenstein's judgment overseeing now. Rachel Brand has to step in after Rosenstein recuses.
@Mattfobrien Shrug all you like. It should not be tolerated. Movies aren't reality. Laws should be followed. I want to trust the FBI. I really do. They'd have to follow the law to keep that trust.
@ezraklein so what? So you're okay with the FBI scamming the FISC in order to spy on an American citizen so long as it's a citizen you don't like? Really?
If you are willing to excuse the FBI scamming the FISC in order to obtain a warrant to spy on an American citizen and avoiding accountability to relevant oversight committee all because you don't like Trump, you don't get to then talk to me about Trump being the dictator-in-chief
Rod Rosenstein is one of four officials signing off on the warrant request and three subsequent renewal requests. I am not saying Rosenstein is corrupt. But this now casts a shadow over his credibility to oversee Mueller investigation. I'm sorry, it just does.
Per the memo, the government (FBI-DOJ) had four opportunities in front of the FISA court to divulge that the dossier was known to have been paid for by DNC/Clinton campaign, and that Bureau knew it was full of holes. McCabe testified no warrant is sought without it.
@jimgeraghty that's what's going to get lost in all of the partisan narrative protection machine on both sides. This by definition cannot tell the whole story. The whole story is classified. But on the surface, they scammed the FISC knowingly and went out of their way to hide it from Congress
@tgart84 I guess playing team sports is cool, too. Enjoy the Super Bowl.
@Drivedabizness Way too early for that. We have an apparently window in what happened. We don't know all the details. This has to be thoroughly investigated - by someone not involved at DOJ or 2nd special counsel. Legal process can work itself out from there.
@tgart84 The planet not pro or anti-Trump. I'm on the planet that's trying to find out if an Article II agency played fast and loose with the FISA Court and tried to avoid accountability to Article I oversight committee in order to cover it up.
@dwdeardorff @POTUS @hughhewitt I don't even care about the timing. There obviously is a political element to all this, but I'm trying to stay focused on what actually happened. I want to see what the Dem memo says. I'd love to hear FBI's response. Out with it all. This charge has to be investigated, though.
Lots of people will focus on team sports - I care about what happened. If some FBI brass scammed FISC to spy on Trump people using what they knew were bogus grounds, and engaged in cover-up of their actions, heads have to roll to rebuild confidence.  https://t.co/NrQXwWpwEq
Byron's really reliable. What memo apparently shows is that FBI knew/admitted bias of Steele dossier, used it to obtain FISA warrant without divulging to FISC it was biased, and that no warrant would have been sought w/out it. That doesn't sound too ethical of FBI to me. https://t.co/GwDTgKiIEm

@ron_fournier It's really not. The FBI, Article II agency, is accountable to Article I, the Congress. The Constitutional crisis would be if the President told Congress no. The FBI cannot suddenly claim they're only accountable to the FISA court. They have statutory relationship with FISC.

@WhittyMike Duh.
@bubbydean i'll fix it tonight. not sure why it glitched.
@michaelbeck @marcorubio he put the issue in a way that just clicked for me to be able to communicate it.
So on the @hughhewitt show this morning, we have the Gang of 7 - Senators @SenJoniErnst, @ChrisCoons, @SenThomTillis, @billcassidy, @sentomcotton, @SenToddYoung, @SenatorWicker.
Shutdown politics at its finest - 		Democrats: I ask unanimous consent for a 3-day CR to make my Republican colleagues look bad by objecting. 		Republican who objects: I object, and I ask UC that we fully fund the government, period, (Above Democrat objects, looking worse.)
Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, just said somebody has to be the grown-ups, presumably meaning him. We Dems refuse to go for a month-long CR, because that's silly. We demand a three-day CR instead, because that's grown-up.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Democrat, just offered an apology on behalf of Senate Republicans for the disastrous legislative year last year (that resulted in tax cuts for 90% of the country and trillions of repatriated corporate money on the way back to the US.
Senate floor debate right now. 		Democrats: Please let us have a 3 day reprieve from us shutting down the government so we can reopen it and shut it down again on Thursday. 		Republicans: Kneel before Zod. You broke it, there's one way to unbreak it. Do your job.
@michaelbeck @hughhewitt *Sigh*
Kevin McCarthy, the @GOPLeader, just reminded @hughhewitt that Chuck Schumer's "offer" of wall funding was no such thing. It was offer of authorization, which happened back in '06. The Democrats have made no concessions at all. Audio and transcript soon at https://t.co/EniAXFlCNU
@slaminj It's not what Wallace said. It's what Mulvaney said. There is a difference between authorization (budget) and spending (appropriations). Authorization of the wall has never been an issue. It's always writing the checks. That's what has to happen from the Dems to get to any deal.
This is so important to understand. No thanks to MSM for botching this. What Schumer offered Trump was wall authorization, not funding. Authorization has been in place since '06. Issue has always funding or appropriations, something Dems never grant.  https://t.co/48sxxjXxCH

@starestherqueen @chrislhayes @maggieNYT The wall helps us enforce the laws, moron. It slows smuggling, both human and drugs. As for real immigration reform, well, the Democrats don't exactly want that, do they? If they did, they wouldn't be shutting the government down.
@BluSmartAss @BarackObama no, that wouldn't have been, because in those years, Obama had his administrative team confirmed. the GOP didn't mandate a 30 hour debate rule on every nominee like the Democrats are doing now. Try to keep up next time instead of just feeling about things.
@clubbing_guy @McFaul Well, that's just fine, because as it happens to turn out, I wasn't replying to you. Ambassador McFaul knows full well the point I'm making.
@CPLiebau It's so obvious that only hyperpartisans can't see it. This is a play to lock in place a guaranteed pipeline of potential new Democratic voters as far as the eye can see, and nothing else.
@McFaul Mr. Ambassador, I know the animus you have. I understand the animus. The Republicans control the House and the White House. The Republicans control what gets brought up in the Senate, but not the outcome. If they had 60 Republicans, they'd control it. And you know this.
You'll notice that there's nothing about a wall or border security in here. There's nothing wrong with regularizing DACA people. It's insane to not do something to prevent the nonsense we're dealing with now again in 10 years. Democrats just want a continued new voter pipeline. https://t.co/VvfZPqVoLQ

@Dr_Nate__ @JerryFuller14 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT @realDonaldTrump There's a comma after all, I in intelligence is capitalized in this case, It's initial, not initially, and it's blasphemous, not blasphemy. And not to pick too much of a nit, there should be a comma after blasphemous, and a period after that. Next time, don't reply to me.
@ToniRae315 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT Was that supposed to be a critically thought tweet? Because if so, that was awfully incoherent. We'll see at the end of the year whether 4% growth and lower taxes for 90% of the country means least productive Congress in history. Garland wasn't a filibuster. It was Biden rule.
@ToniRae315 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT We'll see what that wave looks like after people see what a year of 4% growth and bigger paychecks looks like. When the entire country doesn't die like Nancy Pelosi predicted would happen, you could be disappointed yet again.
@ToniRae315 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT Instead of being intellectually lazy, which seems to be a much more apt moniker for you than critical thinker, try doing a little research. The facts are indisputable. The Senate Democrats are using the Senate 30 hour rule in an unprecedented fashion.
@ToniRae315 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT so that's critical thinking to you, is it? I seldom watch Fox News. I mostly watch MSNBC, if truth be told. I also DVR House and Senate on CSPAN daily. That's one reason I know of which I speak. As for partisan, I am conservative. I also disagree with Trump plenty of times.
@wolfdenduo @starestherqueen @chrislhayes @maggieNYT that is certainly your opinion, but that's not the opinion of those in the DHS. The consensus is there's about 800 miles of the 2,000 that need a wall. Rest can be done with tech. Dems won't bend at all on that for political, not security reasons.
@blackhowling01 @MsABQ323 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT There are nominations that need to take place. no doubt. There are upwards of a hundred nominations pending on final vote waiting out a 30 rule process that's never been implemented in wholesale fashion before.
@butcher1980 @Ckot89Cheryl @joebferraro @chrislhayes @maggieNYT I most certainly did answer that. Trump is going to renegotiate NAFTA, which will bring down the trade deficit we have with Mexico by tens of billions, which easily covers what they're requesting in wall funding. Eventually, they will pay when all is said and done.
@nglange @ceejopolis the vast majority of the people being subject to the 30 hour rule are people who passed nearly unanimously in committee, and would receive large bipartisan votes. They're not controversial, nor are they unqualified. They're held up just to stall. That's what's new.
@ToniRae315 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT Really? Everything? Every single thing? Every Obama nominee in his administration was subject to a 30 hour debate rule before final vote, when they were passed out of committee unanimously? Every single one? Still want to go with that, snowflake?
@Dr_Nate__ @JerryFuller14 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT @realDonaldTrump I have plenty of criticisms of Trump when they're warranted, which is all too frequent. I don't have to resort to profanity or street language to make a point on Twitter. And I'll usually punch back when it's used on me.
@kyledcheney @jpodhoretz I'm okay with any of the three. I think there's a way to make public whether the dossier was used as the subject of a FISA request to spy on Trump team by Obama DOJ without compromising FISA court personnel. If this story comes to us, it should be Katy bar the door time.
@alibertarian @hughhewitt @wesbury @RepJeffDenham @RepMikeTurner @amieparnes @Hillsdale @KirbyCenter @Lileks Keep dreaming, buddy.
@TrumpetTrees @sbtan @JerryFuller14 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT Trump's Tuesday meeting requirements were pretty simple. bare minimum were DACA and border funding. if chain migration and diversity lottery reform needed to happen in phase 2, fine. If done now, better. But "deal" didn't include the required elements.
@TrumpetTrees @sbtan @JerryFuller14 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT Factually not true. A gang of 6 is not both sides. A gang of 6 means, well, six senators agreed. The rest of the GOP caucus, never mind the House, were never going to accept DACA without border funding. It's a non-starter.
@kyledcheney @jpodhoretz If people used false pretenses to get a FISA warrant, that has to be made public. I don't want to see the warrant or know who in the FISA court approved of it. Redact what has to be redacted. But if DOJ/FBI officials abused the system, we need to know.
@jpodhoretz That's what i'm thinking. If Feinstein leaked the Simpson testimony, why doesn't someone just release it. Redact some things if necessary. Don't understand the tease. If this is exculpatory for Trump, out with it. If it's damning of Trump, out with it. If it hits Obama, so be it.
@TrumpetTrees @sbtan @JerryFuller14 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT I realize the "deal" did not include border funding, so it really wasn't a deal. It's not a budget. It's appropriations. And if every Republican were for it, it would still have to clear a 60 vote hurdle, meaning 10 Democrats have to go for it.
@Dr_Nate__ @JerryFuller14 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT @realDonaldTrump The first k is capitalized, there's a comma after rocks, sounds is singular, not plural. Why go to war me with when you're obviously outmatched in your war with the English language?
@genjac3213 @sbtan @JerryFuller14 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT I remember things just fine.
@michaelbeck @hughhewitt somehow, i noticed that.
#Democratcampaignslogals Who are you gonna believe - Nancy Pelosi or your lying wallet?
@starestherqueen @chrislhayes @maggieNYT Then doing right by the dreamers would include making sure we're not in this position again in ten years with another cohort of dreamers. $18 billion, compared to what Obamacare cost, is peanuts. Fund the wall. Why can't you be for that?
@NoJerseyNative @tinaweit human rights, meaning those humans in the womb? I'm all for that. Civil rights, meaning not being forced to engage in commerce if it violates your religious conscience? I'm for it. You mean environmental control meaning Asia no longer gets air conditioning? Good luck with that.
And yet you keep replying. It's funny, that. Always must get the last profane word in?
@ClaudiaLamb @chrislhayes @maggieNYT Of course you are. You've espoused nothing but rock-ribbed conservatism both in your rhetoric and your rationale. And I'm the liar. Good to know, comrade.
@ClaudiaLamb @chrislhayes @maggieNYT I'm sure if I just typed out my leftist Tourette's and swore every other word, my writing would flow much better. Do continue, Princess. Really, you must be a hoot around the holidays.
@ClaudiaLamb @chrislhayes @maggieNYT That's the way it goes, isn't it? Leftists are always truthful because it just feels so right, and anything contrary to their feelers automatically are lying. The Democrats could have CHIP today, if that's really important to them. Good luck at that table for one, bitterness.
@Dr_Nate__ @JerryFuller14 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT @realDonaldTrump I know boy isn't spelled with an i, genius.
@ClaudiaLamb @chrislhayes @maggieNYT Well, with the seniors mostly on fixed incomes that have lower rates at the bottom end, as well as a double standard deduction, they'll probably end up just fine. I know you'll disagree with this, because Nancy Pelosi, your dear leader, told you we were all gonna die.
@ClaudiaLamb @chrislhayes @maggieNYT I bet you were lovable at one point in your life.
@ClaudiaLamb @chrislhayes @maggieNYT I'm saying the House easily passed their version last night. The Senate is dicey. Rand Paul is waffling. With McCain in sick bay, there's no margin for error. We'll find out today what happens there.
@ChingT3 @BeantownDoug @chrislhayes @maggieNYT Just because you're a leftist and don't agree with their ideology does not make them unqualified. I don't agree at all with Justices Sotomayor and Kagan, but they're qualified, and both got fair treatment in their nomination process.
@ClaudiaLamb @chrislhayes @maggieNYT Because, little lady, it takes 60 votes to pass cloture. GOP has 51, but right now, only 50 due to cancer treatment for John McCain. Tax cuts were through reconciliation, which only needs simple majority. Honestly, this is easy stuff. You don't know this?
@aeirould @DonaldsDaddy45 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT Reason for the long delay in that nomination was because the Democrats torpedoed Robert Bork first, speaking of obstruction. Joe Biden and Strom Thurmond, two of the longest-serving members of the Senate in their day, both cited and openly embraced that 80 year precedent. Next?
@aeirould @DonaldsDaddy45 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT You dear, sweet, gullible leftist. Politifact as research is about as reliable as me quoting a breitbart article to you. Allow me to fact-check politifact and you, apparently. Kennedy was appointed to a vacancy that occurred in year 7 of Reagan, not 8.
@Ckot89Cheryl @joebferraro @chrislhayes @maggieNYT And by the way, when I disagreed with Obama on policy, which was often, I never referred to him as your president. Check my timeline. I have had plenty of issues with Trump. I'm not pigeonholed into pro or anti-Trump. Case by case basis with me.
@twodotsknowwhy @chrislhayes @maggieNYT so the fact that 80 years of precedent on both sides where a two-term president in their 8th year with a senate of the other party has never had a supreme court justice vacancy filled means nothing to you, huh? Go ask Joe Biden about that. He knows all about that precedent.
@ClaudiaLamb @chrislhayes @maggieNYT Watch your language, little lady. Don't make me get Obama to call for a beer summit. Technically, the Republicans have submitted budgets. passed them, in fact. that would be the Democrats who don't do budgets and go by only CR's. The fight now is over appropriations, not budget.
@Ckot89Cheryl @joebferraro @chrislhayes @maggieNYT the wall will cost $18 billion. The trade deficit with Mexico under NAFTA is about $71 billion. When Trump renegotiates NAFTA and that deficit shrinks by half, there's how Mexico de facto pays for the wall ultimately. You may not like the answer, but that's the answer.
@ChingT3 @MsABQ323 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT Neither has Trump. Rick Grenell was passed out of committee unanimously. David Stras has a well-qualified ABA rating, was held up by Al Franken out of spite. Again, you can choose to be ignorant. It's your right. Reading might help.
@ChingT3 @BeantownDoug @chrislhayes @maggieNYT because it's not the same model. i know it's hard for you leftists to actually read and learn things, because it interferes with your feelers. Senate GOP did not impose 30 hour rule for every judicial/agency/cabinet appointment for Obama.
@nglange @ceejopolis never said it was a new thing. I'm just saying look at the record. Obama got his admin appointments confirmed without the overuse of the 30 hour debate rule Democrats are employing against Trump nominees. It's just a fact.
@nglange When you will not look at what actually happened and see what is happening now, and call me ignorant, that's ironic.
@lambinhi @chrislhayes @maggieNYT And yet Obama still got his admin appointments confirmed without enforcing the 30 hour rule.
@Boogar_Sugar @NorwoodBrian @IgiturOne @sbtan Show me one 30 hour rule enforcement by the GOP on Obama appointments in his first year. I'll wait.
@Boogar_Sugar @NorwoodBrian @IgiturOne @sbtan You're a leftist, so fact, history and reason is lost on you. As a leftist, any Republican is de facto evil. For the record, you're wrong about GOP obstructionism. It happened on key issues. It was not universal. Obama got his admin team in place by this time in year 2.
@BeantownDoug @chrislhayes @maggieNYT So you're threatening a civil war over an open border?
@Boogar_Sugar @sbtan @JerryFuller14 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT David Stras is s Minnesota Supreme Court justice, grandson of Holocaust survivors. Passed out of committee easily. ABA very qualified rating. Al Franken put a hold on him for no reason. 30 hour rule still being enforced. I could do this all day.
@Boogar_Sugar @sbtan @JerryFuller14 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT Rick Grenell has been waiting for months to get final vote as ambassador to Germany. He passed out of committee near unanimous. He will be voted with no controversy. Democrats still insisting on 30 hours of debate time for no reason.
@Boogar_Sugar @MsABQ323 @sbtan @JerryFuller14 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT Ah, more democracy in action. I don't espouse your leftism, so I can just shut up. Never mind the fact that you responded to me in the first place.
@BeantownDoug @chrislhayes @maggieNYT Never said it wasn't illegal. Just shows that if democrats vote monolithically no on everything and won't negotiate anything in good faith, shutdown is on them by definition.
@Boogar_Sugar @sbtan @JerryFuller14 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT You are entitled to feel as you wish, incorrect though you may be. Obstruction now is an order of magnitude different.
@Boogar_Sugar @NorwoodBrian @IgiturOne @sbtan Nice try. Obstruction by abuse of senate 30 hour rule just for spite by democrats has never been done.
@BeantownDoug @chrislhayes @maggieNYT When it requires 60 votes on most everything and Democrats are totally recalcitrant? Yup.
@aeirould @chrislhayes @maggieNYT Joe Biden rule. He gave voice to a now-80 year precedent where a supreme court vacancy in the 8th year of a president where the senate is run by the opposite party doesn't get that pick seated. 80 years of precedent. But you go ahead. Make that all about GOP obstruction.
@MsABQ323 @sbtan @JerryFuller14 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT which dozens of cabinet members or ambassadors did the GOP enforce the 30 hour rule on during Obama's first 18 months? I'm sure you have that list at your fingertips. I'll wait.
@MsABQ323 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT all of Obama's cabinet/agency/ambassador/judicial appointments were confirmed in his first year. 30 hour debate rule was not enforced by the GOP while they were in the minority. You just are mistaken.
@dicey__ @sbtan @JerryFuller14 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT yes, because and the other lefties are the ultimate arbiters of truth. I thought Oprah just told us all to follow our own truth? Or does that go for everyone except me?
@OhioCoastie @dwdeardorff @EdMorrissey i'm all for it.
@joebferraro @chrislhayes @maggieNYT 2.2 billion is not wall funding. 18 billion is wall funding. Democrats want daca 100% their way now while they think Trump is on the s-hole defensive. Trump should wait until deadline in March. Dems will be much more pliable and nervous by then.
@dwdeardorff @EdMorrissey ed teased me. he made it sound like kelly had announced what was coming if...
@Mr_M_Morris oh, so you're anti-semitic. Shalom.
@tinaweit I stay because 4% growth and a conservative judiciary are worth the other debris. That, and we would be in utter misery under a Hillary Clinton presidency...not just on a personal level, but economically as well. You know she would have been disastrous.
@sbtan Oh, I just looked at your profile. I forgot it is the left who is the ultimate arbiter on what constitutes rational thought...so long as it's leftism.
@tinaweit Nothing would make me happier than to have about 70 Republicans in the Senate so that one or two can't make the perfect the enemy of the good. Let's work for that, shall we?
@djohn820 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT nonsense. all of obama's staff were put in place within the first year. this 30 hour rule the Democrats are pulling with nominees passed out of committees unanimously? This is brand new obstruction territory. Chomp on that.
@sbtan @JerryFuller14 @chrislhayes @maggieNYT i know it makes your feelers better to believe that to be true, but facts are stubborn things. It's just not true.
@Mr_M_Morris Honestly, you can't do any better than that? Ask Israel is walls work. there is 800 miles of the 2,000 that needs a wall. rest can be managed with other tech. I'll take my chances on what most Americans believe.
@tinaweit @chrislhayes @maggieNYT Sure does. does Joe Biden ring a bell? 80 years of precedent where the senate does not confirm a SC justice vacancy that comes up in the 8th year of a potus with an opposing party-controlled Senate. Honestly, this history stuff, it's not hard if you read.
@Mr_M_Morris nice try, not accurate. House and Senate GOP, along with Trump, are willing to let DACA kids stay. The wall must be funded in order to secure the border and keep another DACA problem from developing over the next decade. The issues are directly related, must be same bill.
Fun? That's fake news. https://t.co/q4tltwbbgx
@hasnothing2say @chrislhayes @maggieNYT allowing DACA kids to stay, provided they aren't felons, and putting them in line with everyone else on path to citizenship is a compromise. Trump/GOP have ceded that ground. What ground has the left ceded to get to bipartisan compromise?
@Mr_M_Morris @chrislhayes @maggieNYT Republicans have said DACA kids can stay if their nose is clean. That is a compromise from their former position. What exactly have the Democrats compromised on vis-a-vis the wall, diversity lottery, or chain migration? They haven't at all.
@JohnJHallett @chrislhayes @maggieNYT Republicans said no to Obamacare. Obama, however, got all of his judges and cabinet/agency appointments confirmed in his first year without enforcing the 30 hour rule on each one to slow it all down. I can do this all day.

@davecatanese I'll bet you the michigan seat race between john james and debbie stabenow ends up being closer than AZ if McSally is the nominee.
@davecatanese That's how it works. Arpaio and Ward are going to be fishing out of the same end of the pond. McSally is all by herself with the center-right, and she'll easily win a plurality in the primary, and she's easily electable over Sinema in November.
@alibertarian Well then, go listen to the NY Post every morning, Mr. Smartypants.
Seems to me fairly easy to decide whether he said it or not, as there were others in the room. The buzz in DC afterwards was the WH calculated it would be shrugged off by most, so they didn't push back. He's apparently miscalculated how immense the blowback would be.
What he was reported to have said in the Post yesterday is indefensible. He's had 15 hours to deny it. His press shop issued a statement last night that specifically did not deny it. If only he were in a job that afforded him media opportunities to set the record straight... https://t.co/1YN7EIHUZl
It's official. @MarthaMcSally just announced on @hughhewitt's show that she's running for Senate in Arizona to replace Jeff Flake next year. Go Martha, go.
@TheRickWilson but you have 288K followers. You're only thanking 500? Can you conjure up a word for those following you that you haven't thanked this morning?
If Sarah Huckabee Sanders were smart, provided she conducts a press briefing today, which I'm sure will be standing room only in the Brady room, she'd begin the briefing by showing the countries that are on one screen behind her, and a list of countries that aren't on the other.
A secondary annoyance to the sh*thole comments attributed to the President yesterday in the Post is that the Secret Service now has to come up with a new code name after he inadvertently leaked the one they'd been using.
@bedfordguy I don't know. It's indefensible. The real question is can Congress man up, as it were, and do a deal in spite of the self-destructive nature of the President?
Just from a negotiating standpoint, it's harder to cut a deal now and get to 60. Just dumb to say, and dumber not to deny when asked to clarify it.
Now, after these comments marinate in the public space for a while not being denied they were spoken, what Democrat, even if they'd otherwise be willing to do a deal, will do so now because they fear backlash for working with someone who says/thinks about immigrants that way?
After Tuesday's public working group, he had Democrats at least incrementally agreeing to something they said was a non-starter - funding for the wall. Their offer is not enough, and the WH has rejected it, but he was dealing from a place of strength on the issue.
Here's why what the President allegedly said today was politically dumb, despite the reprehensible way he said it and despite the implications of how he treats the rest of humanity. It's dumb because he was making progress on the immigration bill.
@IAmPacer @TheronC i fully embrace my conservatism. i'm not throwing https://t.co/nTsyXNO6zo stats at you, though.

Dodged a bullet today with @EdMorrissey. Missed having to talk about the WaPo story this afternoon by about 10 minutes. What a sh*thole that would have been to talk about on the fly.
@clumsygirlPNW @gabrielmalor @SenCoryGardner Actually, a thing that's been a thing for over 80 years? That's kind of a thing.
@ssnbbr @TheronC Rhetorically easy to type, manifestly shallow intellectually to believe. I'm sure you can do better if you really apply yourself. When Trump does something bad, blast him. I certainly do. When he does good stuff, 1) be big enough to recognize it, and 2) reward the good.
@IAmPacer @TheronC Can you name one Obama appointee - court or cabinet/department level, that had to wait for the 30 hour rule? Obama had his entire team in place in year one. He had his revised team in place in year 5 (second term). Nice try, though. I get it, You're a lefty. Feelers beats facts.
@AWonderBitchToo @gabrielmalor @SenCoryGardner yes, I will say that with a straight face. If you're still butt hurt over Merrick Garland, go ask Joe Biden what the precedent is for a SC vacancy in the 8th year of a POTUS when the Senate is a different party. They haven't been filled for nearly a century.
@ssnbbr @TheronC Now you may be a lefty, or someone who just hates Trump and anything that springs forth from Trump, in which deeming goodness is impervious to your nature. But the fact of the matter is Trump has put very fine judges on the higher courts, and more to come.
@ssnbbr @TheronC Neil Gorsuch, Don Willett, Amul Thapar, John K. Bush, Kevin Newsom, Ralph R. Erickson, Amy Coney Barrett, Joan Larsen, Allison H. Eid, Stephanos Bibas, Gregory G. Katsas, Steven Grasz, James C. Ho, David Stras. All have well-qualified ABA ratings, best there is.
@clumsygirlPNW @gabrielmalor @SenCoryGardner no, nothing like it, actually. No POTUS in a century has gotten a SC from a Senate of another party in their 8th year. Ask Joe Biden about that. He's famous for endorsing that precedent. But you keep being you.
@MountainRaptor @TheronC Fact Check: False. Your lefty slip is showing. Might want to hike it up a tad.
@IAmPacer @TheronC Cory Gardner is a Republican. If you're trying to ding me on Merrick Garland, that is an 80 year precedent where senates of one party do not confirm SC picks of a potus of another party when that nomination is in their 8th year. Bipartisan precedent. Read.

@bedfordguy probably right. The Supremes will weight in this one fairly quickly, as judicial cases go.
@TheronC If it's an unjust law, change the law. Write a new one. That's what legislators are supposed to do. The Constitution allows for remedies for things like this. Holding back good nominees is a political stunt, not a solution.
@gabrielmalor @SenCoryGardner No, he's not right to do this. His Constitutional role as a legislator is if he doesn't like a law that's on the books, which Jeff Sessions is very much right to enforce since he's an Article II officer now, is to change the law. He can do that. Holding up nominees is a stunt.
@michaelbeck uh huh.
So this judge is going to get overturned fairly quickly. Just like Obama issued an executive order unconstitutionally on DACA, Trump has every right to reverse it via executive order. This is why judicial appointments are everything.  https://t.co/pA0A7D193q

@WaynesterAtl @yidwithlid You're missing the point. Following "your truth" is a fallacy from the start. Truth either is or isn't. Once you get into following "your truth", you have no grounds to criticize Trump for doing the same. It's the same thing as new math, where if answer feels right, fine.

@ladyhart Absolutely. My nit with her is that there is no "your truth." There is truth, and there is untruth. There is partial truth, and that always needs explanation. But if 'follow your truth' is her admonition, that's no better than what we've got that of which they complain greatly.
Sheesh, Globes, let the man thank his wife and makeup team. You didn't play walking music to rush Oprah, you know. Oprah's character didn't defeat Hitler. Congrats, Gary Oldman, on a well-deserved Golden Globe. Maybe for the Oscars, a little Larry Arnn love?
Here's the problem with what she said. Donald Trump speaks his truth every day. It may not be my truth, it's certainly not the truth of a lot of people, right and left. But he following Oprah's advice to the letter, and she still hates him. https://t.co/mrrt3lHEf7

@PhilippeReines No doubt. But with a Wolff book, it's a roll of the dice which 50% is true. I'll wait a bit and see what shakes out before piling on.
@PhilippeReines I know Bannon hasn't denied any of Wolff's quotes, and many haven't, but some have, and it's fair to note that Wolff's track record isn't exactly pure when it comes to fabrication of quotes.

3. I know people are still hopped up on the idea that Donald Trump is going to be removed from office for criminal activities exposed by the special counsel. He could. You'll break the brand of the FBI forever if the Hillary server scandal isn't also investigated outside of FBI.

Here's where I expand a little on my wild speculation about how @realDonaldTrump could help himself in the Senate with a cabinet shakeup. https://t.co/n8nBeuanhJ
@karr_pe Wrong. Patrick Morrisey is the AG of WV - statewide name ID. he'll be a wonderful senator.
He wouldn't be bad at Energy, couldn't really get himself in ideological trouble, and the new WV governor would appoint a replacement until a special or normal election in '18 is held. Neutralizes the Alabama/Roy Moore damage.
Rick Perry replacing Scott Pruitt at EPA. Now here's the shrewd part.	Joe Manchin replacing Rick Perry at Energy. Manchin has said he wouldn't fall for that stunt in the past. Looking at the makeup of WV in 2018, and his chances now, think he'd reconsider taking that parachute?
If President Trump were shrewd, or at least a wannabe baseball manager, here's the lineup change, since he's considering a cabinet shakeup.		Mike Pompeo replacing Rex Tillerson at State.	Tom Cotton replacing Mike Pompeo at CIA. 	Scott Pruitt replacing Jeff Sessions at DOJ.
@tee866 He's been complaining that he was shut out of the process, that's why he voted no. Know an easy way he could have been part of the process? Changing that little D to an R. He chose poorly, and WV will punish him for it...provided Steve Bannon doesn't pick the nominee.
He's toast in '18. When West Virginians get a year with bigger net paychecks, Joe Manchin is not only not going to have a defense, but his opponent will be able to brand him as a party man who will go along with Democrat wishes to take that money away if they get back to power. https://t.co/NG2TvE0RQS

@JimMcKayWV Here's the fun part. We will see who is right and who is wrong in fairly short fashion. There's about 400,000 workers who just today either had their incomes raised, or got bonuses they weren't expected directly because of this. And that's before individual rates kick in.
@IStateYourName_ it doesn't get soggy because it's sprayed with a lacquer finish. It's the same sealer that BMW uses on their undercarriages.
@JimMcKayWV again, factually not true. You can not want people to keep more of their own money. That puts you in the minority. Most people will be quite pleased to keep more of their money. Medicare can't be protected. It can only be saved if reformed. You're fighting a losing battle.

America, keep track of how you do next year, because Republicans are going to remind you which party allowed Washington to take less of your money, and also that every single nationally-elected Democrat tried to stop that from happening.

@Traster It's pretty simple. Article I says the Congress are to make the laws. If net neutrality should be a thing, it's up to the Congress to make that a law. What Obama did was take an Article II agency and they made the law themselves. That's not how it's ever supposed to work.
@mflixx that certainly seems reasonable.
Dear freaked out net neutrality internet people: If the internet needs to be regulated to within an inch of its life, there is a way. It's called legislation. Introduce a bill, debate it, get it passed instead of having a bureaucratic agency do it for you. Love, the Constitution.
I cannot be certain, but I am willing to wager that Iraq today has steadier internet service than is provided by @coxbusiness. It's remarkable they cannot provide the service they purport to sell continuously.
@Tropicow If the House and Senate go tango uniform, i'm only watching it once. I wouldn't watch it twice, even with your eyes.
I'm telling you, @HouseGOP and @SenateGOP, I didn't survive cancer three times to not get a tax cut and be forced to live tweet a @mkhammer Christmas chick flick. Don't make me turn my back on you in 2018.
OK, @HouseGOP and @SenateGOP, I have defended you all year. I say you'll get tax reform done by this time next week. My bet is with @EdMorrissey, who has lost faith in you. If you screw this up, and I have to watch The Christmas Prince on Christmas Day, you deserve what's coming.
@endoftimetravel it does indeed. prayers.
@lachlan You know why he was living with dead cats, right? Because dead puppies, well, they're not much fun. https://t.co/Grg4qZi6Au
@P226_Sig Well, you'd be one to know.
I, for one, will miss Paul Ryan as @SpeakerRyan. I tune out the noise. He accomplished a hell of a lot this year alone in a job he never wanted. As for who's next, I nominate @RepGallagher, another talented Cheesehead that would make one more weekly guest of ours moving up.
@jksolver @EdMorrissey Agreed. Although I'm a firm believer that God does have a wonderful sense of humor and that I wouldn't be surprised to have a piano fall on my car from an overpass as I fly by doing 90.
@thepubprobably Heretic.
@RightGlockMom @EdMorrissey Would it help justify the tears and not knowing me if I told you I was chopping onions in the background while I tweeted this?
@hughhewitt Fact check: True. I still have the tape where you said on air I only had to begin the 50th lap by the time the show ended. Your rules, counselor.
And once and for all, we will make the determination that the definitive Christmas movie of all time is indeed Die Hard. https://t.co/VKYHDrkUrb
Today was a big day for me on the cancer front. It's come back twice a year after I thought I beat it. Today was the scan in that time frame. What's left of original lymph node is shrinking, and there is 0 detectable energy from it. Totally inert, total remission. Thank God.
50, DAMMIT! https://t.co/sBIPif2T9k
@michaelbeck I have no idea why you were so hot and bothered this morning about baseball. I mean, really. It's only December. You have a long time to go before your realize you're doomed to watch a sea of red this fall from the AL.
@michaelbeck I wonder if Gurriel is going to react to our new pitcher. You know he's not from around here, right?
@jamesmceldowney @michaelbeck Let Boone play 3rd. Player/manager. Old school.
@michaelbeck That's because he's got about a four inch strike zone. It's not worth trying.
@michaelbeck so what you're saying is the fossil was the Altuve tribal leader?
@jamesmceldowney @michaelbeck 4 wide ones to stanton, 4 wide ones to judge, 6-4-3 double play, flight out to left. rinse. repeat. If the Yankees are too stupid to fire a good manager, they're too stupid to win anything serious.
@michaelbeck You know they found a fossil in the news of a 5 foot 8 penguin, right? Just sayin'.
@michaelbeck Pingüino - You know it's coming on nickname shirt weekend. (You know you're tempted to look it up.)
@michaelbeck Didn't I see on the news last night Altuve was spotted eating Lobster Thermidor with a molten lava chocolate cake chaser at some ritzy restaurant?
@michaelbeck They won already. They're complacent. I hear Altuve is planning on coming to camp in february around 210. I've even been told his teammates have a new nickname for him. Pingüino
@ItsThatBriGuy Trout has at least 5 years in centerfield before that is an issue, ohtani will be a dh, and pujols can very much play 1B. his foot is finally healed. That was his only hangup.
@ItsThatBriGuy pujols will have had a full offseason without surgery on his foot for the first time in years. he's going to do just fine with trout in front of him and ohtani behind him. Trout is Trout. Ohtani is fine. He was just medically cleared. 6 man rotation!
This stuff is getting out of control. I talked with our friend Yoni this week, whose new company, https://t.co/UL1KlSYU32, can deal with stuff like this unlike any other company in the world. https://t.co/kP9TRtU3dx
hey, @michaelbeck, I realize you're still stuck in a October memory loop about something the Astros did, but have you come out of your fog long enough to notice the @Angels have basically sewn up the AL for 2018?
@dirtseller The only one that openly supported him that I know of is Jeff Flake. Everyone else sat on their hands and prayed a safe would accidentally fall on him.
@KeithThompson1 I would agree with you in principle. Not one Democrat, not Joe Manchin, not Heidi Heitkamp, voted for @JusticeWillett today. The hyper-partisanship on judges is overwhelming right now.
@jeisrael I could be wrong, but i think you need 50 to pass.
@mobes1 No one was trying, convicting, incarcerating or condemning his eternal soul. The allegations were plenty believable to anyone not blinded by partisanship. But set that aside. He ran about the worst campaign one can run. horribly staffed, horrible messaging. He was a train wreck.
@laura_lrnzo Everybody loves the Ho down - Drew Carey on Whose Line Is It Anyway. https://t.co/7h8Wyo22La
@EdMorrissey @ChrisCoons Disappointing.
@TheSmokingYeti Old school. Tradition. They do voice votes. Always have. You gotta be there to vote.
@TianaTheFirst @ReaganBattalion Sure, rub it in, why don't you?
By the way, how important is Alabama last night? Take the vote on @justicewillett. @SenatorStrange was one of the 50 that voted for him to go to the 5th Circuit. McCain is out sick, one other GOP absent. Had Doug Jones been there, vote has to be delayed or fails. Thin margin.
RT @hughhewitt: Is there a “not a producer but in Studio 23/24 hours list?” https://t.co/ABHfeE7zGY
50-47 for @justicewillett. McCain is in sick bay at Walter Reed due to ill effects of cancer treatment. His absence is obviously excused. Democrats are a disgrace for this vote. Willett's qualifications and temperament are above reproach.
Congrats, @justicewillett. You're a judge again. Welcome to the 5th. Do great things. And keep tweeting.
@EdMorrissey Yeah, well, independent really has a different meaning these days, doesn't it?
@EdMorrissey it'll probably be a party line vote. Was just hoping @ChrisCoons would reconsider after talking to @hughhewitt this morning. Coons said there was something Willett had said or done he didn't like, but couldn't articulate what that was.
@EdMorrissey @JusticeWillett I think he'll get 51. John McCain is at Walter Reed right now. Look to see if @ChrisCoons, who otherwise is a principled Democrat, to maybe vote for him.
RT @EdMorrissey: @Radioblogger @hughhewitt That would be very ... meta.
@EdMorrissey @hughhewitt We should make a list of all the people who don't include us in lists.
@Hirdman Oh, yes. You watch. Yes, he's militantly pro-abortion, but if he's got half a brain in him, he'll be the Joe Manchin of the Deep South. Senate Dems already know he'll have to take personal electoral interest votes against them.
*sigh* - @Radioblogger, @hughhewitt https://t.co/pOPbQyRdrl
What will be fun is watching the left lose their mind the first time Doug Jones votes with Republicans on something significant because he wants to remain Senator for longer than 3 years. https://t.co/mY1UWdE4kW
@AaronBlake With respect, I don't think that's exactly accurate. ACA was passed with Paul Kirk as appointed Massachusetts Senator 60-39 on 12/24/09. Scott Brown wasn't elected until 1/19/10. His election is what scuttled conference and fallback to a reconciliation bill that passed.
@dirtseller Republicans in Alabama stayed home, because they couldn't bring themselves to vote for A) a child molester, or B) a Democrat. But yeah, it's GOPe's fault. Go with that, Frank. Whatever gets you thru the night.
Paging @TimPawlenty, your campaign is waiting. https://t.co/sLxnOiRCIO
Typically, when one is on a plane that has crashed, and is fortunate enough to survive the impact, he usually doesn't break into the cockpit in an attempt to continue steering the plane. But then again, this is 2017. https://t.co/4KNe4Mp8l1
@mflixx Look, the answer to all our problems is more Republican senators. They just can't be child molesters or ones that are stuck on stupid. Have a brain, have a message, keep your privates tucked away, is that too much to ask?
@goldhat_lou Only in case of emergencies.
@ByronYork Careful, Byron. @CNNPR is reporting Anderson's Twitter account has been hacked, and they're working with Twitter to restore security to it.
@DPlucky @mtoni93 To be brutally honest, in a state where normally all you need is A) a pulse and B) an R next to your name to win a general election campaign, Roy Moore did everything humanly possible to sabotage his campaign. Even despite the allegations, it was amateur hour from start to finish
@mflixx Tough Love.
And you would have had repeal/replacement of Obamacare and John McCain's vote would have been meaningless. It's an easy formula, actually. Run good candidates, and you can usually win on issues. https://t.co/Up5NQ3i05C
@mflixx No, i think the Democrats voted for Doug Jones in the primary. Steve Bannon was the pied piper trying to sell Moore as Trump-lite. All I can hope for now is that the Bannon spell breaks with this defeat.
@Leo_Pusateri If Luther Strange had won the primary, we wouldn't have been having these conversations today. If anyone who didn't attempt to rape a 14 year old girl had won the primary, we'd be fine today
Again, interesting, but not dispositive as to what beat Roy Moore. Roy Moore beat Roy Moore. The creepy factor was off putting enough to cause turnout in strong Republican counties to fall off dramatically. A lot stayed home that wouldn't have if GOP fielded a non-molester. https://t.co/kicSpAA1dx
@nadinecarroll That's all fine. Has nothing to do with McConnell. McConnell is dealing with the reality that he's always 3 votes, now 2, away from disaster, yet still got rules changed, judges confirmed, and tax cuts/individual mandate repeal imminent.
Problem is, apparently, you can't put into Moore what God left out - class. https://t.co/bBHqx46wrJ
@Dagny_Galt No, and I don't think it will cause Bannon to go away, either. But unless the GOP deals with the cancer that Bannon represents, they'll never have the numbers to govern effectively.
What these stats don't factor in is quantity. Too many Republicans sat it out yesterday. Normal turnout, relatively normal candidate, same ratios, Doug Jones gets beat like a redheaded stepchild. https://t.co/yjZAgooycd
@mflixx There was an Operation Chaos in Alabama this year. The Democrats had nothing to do with it. Steve Bannon ran it. The sooner people kick Bannon to the curb, and this means President Trump as well, the better. He's a contagion.
@mflixx Trump supported Strange.
@alibertarian Sometimes, God's answer is no. People seem to have a hard time with that. They convince themselves that unless God says yes, he hasn't weighed in, yet.
@nadinecarroll now you're getting into really out there stuff. coup plotters?
Wait on God? A Democrat winning in Alabama isn't God having something to say? I'm not saying God is a Democrat. He's independent. But last night was definitely something out of the ordinary. https://t.co/Hq9uQni84Z
The deck was dealt by Roy Moore. Doug Jones stood on 12. Moore busted. He kept chasing aces. https://t.co/yYd7qJ1Lc3
@nadinecarroll McConnell got you Neil Gorsuch, 12 circuit court judges, tax reform and individual mandate repeal this year, and freed up filibuster rules to allow judges and cabinet picks to be confirmed easier. But you go ahead and hate on him. It's insane, but go ahead.
@nadinecarroll Why wouldn't McConnell back Strange? You act as though that's a sin against humanity. If Brooks was the right guy, why didn't Bannon back him? Strange was as reliable a vote as you could possible want. Accusing McConnell of meddling and ignoring Bannon is willful blindness.
@TPCarney Oh, and that little bit about Roy Moore being the worst candidate to run since the founding, too.
@johnondrasik My guess is he stays relatively quiet for a year, waits out 2018. If the wave happens and he's in the majority in '19, he goes left and rides the anti-Trump wave in '20. If GOP/economy gains in '18, he moderates very quickly in '19.
Roy Moore and Steve Bannon own this. No one else. https://t.co/6D9SlIaGBi
I wonder if Roy Moore is aware that underage girls are not actually allowed to vote.
@CG_Cynic @CCC6 It's just a flesh wound.
5. Biggest loser of the night? Al Franken. Now he really has to go. He really had other plans of withdrawing his resignation had Moore won.  6. After preying on Alabama Republicans for months, Roy Moore should, if he had an ounce of class, respect the results of tonight &amp; leave.
@johnspierce @EdMorrissey Nice try. Not even Alabama went all in on Moore. Good luck, though. Instead, you own a guy who believes life is able to be exterminated by whim of the mother until moment of delivery. Try selling that extremism nationally.
3. Remind voters throughout 2018 that the Democrats' new superstar, Doug Jones, believes that mothers should have the right to terminate life until the moment before delivery with no penalty. That's beyond extreme. 4. Senate GOP better close ranks and get more stuff done in 2018.
Alabama takeaways - 1. Keep in mind, a normal GOP candidate beats Doug Jones by double digits. 2. Reminder to NRSC and RCCC - recruit good candidates, and you will have a very good 2018. Listen to Bannon at your own peril. 1)
GOP needs to treat Steve bannon as a leper.
The GOP brand nationally dodged a bullet tonight. Now republicans need to make gains in 2018 and treat Steve ban
@nadinecarroll well, when one assaults a 14 year old, I don't generally hold them in esteem.
The stupid, it burns. Who knew Dumb and Dumber was actually a biopic? https://t.co/a1Fye1q3DJ
@nadinecarroll Do I think it will happen? Probably not, to their great shame. Should it happen? Oh, yes. It truly amazes beyond belief how many people want to embrace him for political purposes when they would shun him in a second in their private lives.
@RuthAnneAdams Yup. It's his pen. He likes clicking it. If I were 2,000 miles closer, i'd give him a non-clickable pen.
@nadinecarroll Yup. And with the added benefit of Senate rules, meaning Ethics Committee and Al Franken's prior conduct as a precedent to jurisdiction of said Ethics Committee, at this point, I hope he wins, gets expelled, Kay Ivey appoints a replacement and we have a do-over in '18.
@nadinecarroll that's where you and I disagree strongly. Moore is not one of my own. I do not, will not, claim him as our own.
@nadinecarroll Oh, I think Moore's going to win outside the margin of error. They're just so minor league they're lower than rookie ball.
@nadinecarroll A lot of observers who would otherwise have shrugged off the anti-Semitism allegation as just silly will now hear that phrase and begin to wonder if they really are anti-Semitic. This isn't so much a Senate campaign as a bizarre episode of Veep.
@nadinecarroll Historically, if you're not racist, you don't say my best friends are black. if you're not a homophobe, you don't say some of my best friends are gay. There has been a movie and a TV series with the title "Some of my best friends are..." It's just dumb to use that phrase.
@michaelbeck But it didn't need to be said that yesterday also showed that some of his favorite interviewers are 12 year old girls.
These @Morning_Joe producers are far better than me. "Hey, Alabamanians, here's a deal. Get up early, put on a suit, come to a restaurant to watch a bunch of people from DC you don't like talk about you while you stare at food getting cold you can't eat for 25 minutes."
So the Wile E. Coyote, Supergenius of terrorists, Akayed Ullah, apparently had his suicide vest backwards so that it blew inward, not outward. Better to be lucky than good, I guess.
Kayla Moore at a rally last night defended against the anti-Semitism charge by saying her lawyer is a Jew, and some of their best friends are Jews. It's as though the Moores are now experimenting to see how over the top they can sound and still get elected. 2/2
Roy Moore condemns bogeyman George Soros to Hell on radio. Soros is Jewish, so Moore gets accused of being anti-Semitic. Moore's comments were a childish interpretation of Gospels. Charge he is anti-Semitic is also a childish interpretation. How does it achieve perfect stupid? 1)
Coming up at 8pm eastern in https://t.co/7JznnRDmdX for subscribers: The Aftershow with commentary and analysis on the near miss terror attack in NYC today, and other fallout from the Jerusalem embassy decision from Yoni the Blogger.
@mflixx Which I believe to be a big mistake on the RNC's part. And to his credit, Cory Gardner has continued to withhold funding from the NRSC. He may still yet win. If so, I am 100% certain we will be very sorry he is the face of the GOP, and that the GOP embraced him.
@mflixx I'm sorry you went through what you went through. I'm sorrier that your politics have clouded your ability to recognize what rings true. I am not pronouncing him guilty, incarcerating him, nor judging his soul. But I know what I know, &amp; want nothing to do with him in the GOP.
@mflixx Look, Matt, you are perfectly free to defend a child molester, just as I'm free not to support one. Don't look for me to come around to your position anytime soon.
@bedfordguy @Angels Pujols will play first a lot more. He'll be healthy enough.
If T-Paw gets into the race to win Al Franken's Senate seat in 2018, he can live on our show. He'd be outstanding in the Senate. https://t.co/mHyOJ9g3hJ
@ron_fournier two intentional walks, and get the next guy to roll into a double play. easy peasy.
At least one more, apparently. https://t.co/vjuCOhnVGr
@KoonsGlenn absolutely. we have plenty of starters now.
Let's go, @Angels, all we need is a second baseman, and I'd say we have 2018 about sewn up.
@mflixx I was unaware Leigh Corfman had anything to do with a yearbook or Gloria Allred.
@michaelbeck As is good and proper with all good, young pitchers.
@ConservativeLA hey, part 2 of the NY doc for tonight wasn't in the zip file you sent. the playlist is built, but there's a hole where part 2 would be. can you check and email separate?
Let me translate for you. I've been to the Minnesota state fair several times, and I speak Franken. I'm 48th in seniority, I've offered nothing of substance in my senatorial career, and my only value was fundraising in Hollywood. That's out now, and so am I.
@IsraelHatzolah @philipaklein Al Franken: I don't remember instances this way, but I know I haven't embarrassed this body, but I'm quitting, but not quite yet, and whattabout Trump. Sheesh, you lecherous buffoon, just leave now the fool you are without speaking further and removing any doubt.
RT @IsraelHatzolah: BREAKING NEWS ALERT: Code red sirens sounding in southern Israel, incoming rocket warning, seek shelters immediately.
@mflixx Leigh Corfman was not paid off. That's crazy talk.
@jenifer__5 So what it all boils down to for you is Trump needs to go. Until that happens, everything else is just noise to you. That's fine. Lots out there like you. I've known people that were that way when Clinton was president. It's a miserable way to live. I wish you well.
RT @mdubowitz: June 2017: Senate votes 90-0, that “Jerusalem should remain the undivided capital of Israel.” Trump: “OK”. Reaction: Mass hy…
@SherryTerm @hughhewitt We could, but to be perfectly honest, I'd just as soon not hear him public again after today. I'd be grateful if he were to go away somewhere and stay there.
@mflixx Let's have a little honesty check here. Do you think OJ killed his wife? I'm not asking you to either judge his eternal soul or incarcerate him. I'm asking you to use discernment. You are only not believing the women accusing Moore for political reasons.
@mflixx Nonsense. Franken won his last re-elect handily. He's still being driven out. And Franken is being driven out for acts he did before he was Senator. That paves the way to boot Moore.
@jenifer__5 I agree. And I'm sure you would agree that covering up for someone you know committed rape is just as bad, which is exactly what you're doing by trying to insinuate it's in the past, we need to deal with Trump in the here and now. Fun fact: Trump's sins are in the past, too.
@mflixx Nonsense. You proclaim to be follower of Christ. That means you understand the concept of discernment, I think. You know he's done these bad things, so fine. Vote for him. But throw him out afterwards, have Kay Ivey replace him until new election. Don't condone evil for politics.
@JonahNRO @RichLowry I would have taken out a loan to afford pay-for-view of the Princess Bride battle of wits between @RichLowry and Al Franken to the death with iocaine powder.
@jenifer__5 I'm too dramatic? Tell that to Juanita Broaddrick and Kathleen Willey. My guess is they don't think I'm being too dramatic about what Bill Clinton did to them, and then how Hillary Clinton smeared them afterwards.
@jenifer__5 She covered up and enabled her husband, making it possible for him to rape and assault countless women. But I get it. Whatever the question, the answer is impeach Trump. You keep your focus. I'm glad your life now has purpose.
@mflixx So you're defending a guy who attacked a 14 year old girl, huh? You must be so proud.
@allahpundit Without question. And it will have the added benefit of paving the way for Republicans to return the favor with Roy Moore, should he win.
His office denied yesterday afternoon he'd made up his mind fully, but that's only to build an audience. Make no mistake. He's gone. Dead senator walking. He will not be remembered or missed in the Senate by anyone by the time the calendar turns. https://t.co/KLfmtoDV8V
@mflixx Yes. Mike Pence, to us, had a better character, and we underestimated that Hillary Clinton's issues would neutralize his issues. But we are consistent. We want the creeps out. 2016 was a binary choice where neither candidate had the moral high ground.
@jenifer__5 I know. I read your timeline. you're anti-Trump all the time. It's your singular focus. Here's the problem with that. You're so blinded by Trump hatred that you voted for a woman who has enabled a rapist for decades. Congrats on your consistency.
@jenifer__5 I called for him to step down after Access Hollywood tape. He didn't. Unlike with Franken, everyone knew of Trump's issues before the election, voted him anyway because they were neutralized by Hillary Clinton's enabling of a sexual deviant.
You know, it wasn't so long ago that the Al Franken presidential campaign for 2020 was floated. https://t.co/ipVOE7GZ0s, https://t.co/I44zgX8dif, https://t.co/YfKBZ1jDzz. Today, Al Franken's political career ends this way. https://t.co/MMmWMoxbmw
@tophernoun @hughhewitt why deny you the ability to see how the radio sausage is made?
@jimgeraghty And @EdMorrissey is hit the hardest. He's always been a Die Hard denier.
@jimgeraghty Santa knows.
@michaelbeck @hughhewitt @SInow @MLB @astros @JoseAltuve27 shouldn't he be standing on the box to make him look bigger instead of sitting next to it?
@michaelbeck @RettRas Slacker.
@GenAugustoP Absolutely untrue. Tom cotton is southern, Christian, conservative. Haley Barbour was loud and obnoxious. I just don't like creeps of either stripe. I'm apolitical in this.
@MNVikin unclear whether allegations against Trump happened before or after marriage to Melania, to be honest. I just know that Hillary covered up rape by Bill Clinton, enabled it for her own political interest. That's pretty bad, too.
@GenAugustoP There we are, at an impasse. We disagree on the believability of the accusers.
@GenAugustoP Again, setting aside the assault allegation, if the rest are all just Moore doing what guys do in Alabama at that time, and claiming to be a Christian, why lie about it? If it's wrong, admit it was in your past, you've repented, end of story. Why lie about it?
@GenAugustoP The thing to me that's most disturbing about Moore, despite the assault allegation of the 14 year old, is that his supporters are saying this was the culture, no big deal. Yet Moore continues to lie/deny it when evidence is overwhelming he hunted these girls.
@GenAugustoP It rings true to me that OJ killed his wife. That's not bias confirmation. Same think about Leigh Corfman. Story yesterday, while not assault, showed pattern of trolling for very young girls by a guy in his 30s, and willing to lie about it.
@MNVikin I did because that issue was neutralized by the equally creepy enabling Hillary Clinton. Guess I just hoped that the job would force him in line a little bit.
@GenAugustoP ok, now that that ugliness is behind us, to your point. Romney is certainly not the perfect Republican, but no allegations of personal impropriety I've seen. With Moore, there's oodles that ring true. Romney may be too moderate on some issues, but he's not creepy. Moore is creepy
@GenAugustoP No, I was referring to your GFY request. I don't engage with that kind of nonsense.
@michaelbeck @hughhewitt You could say that. You could also say Mueller, having run the FBI and knowing this guy for a while, never should have hired him in the first place.
@GenAugustoP You first. Lead by example.
@davidjacksmith I don't care if he doesn't lift a finger, but actively prevent him? Romney would be a reliable vote 90% of the time or better. He'd vote more reliably than Moore would. Remember, Trump backed Luther Strange over Moore because Strange was a more reliable vote.
Fairly surreal that a year into Donald Trump, among the many good things he's done, he'd end 2017 trying to keep someone like Mitt Romney out of the Senate while simultaneously working for Roy Moore. I'm not exactly welcoming or celebrating this moral hiatus in the GOP very much.
@bmaloney7861 @hughhewitt Every day presents the opportunity to consider whether a personal day should be used.
@AnneCW @DanPoelstra @GOP I'm just reveling in your centrism you display with each tweet.
@AnneCW @DanPoelstra @GOP Whatever you say, comrade.
@AnneCW @DanPoelstra @GOP You wish the government to run health care. Marx would concur. You wish higher taxes on the rich. Marx would concur. You engage in class warfare by repeating trickle down hysteria. Marx would concur. You seem to disapprove of lowering corporate rates. So would Marx.
@AnneCW @DanPoelstra @GOP Tell me, o all-seeing centrist, who did you cast your vote for in the 2016 primary?
@AnneCW @DanPoelstra @GOP And yet you know we well enough to determine when I'm lying. What remarkable powers you must possess. I mean, to be the sole arbiter of all truth, knowledge and wisdom - how can you deal with that awesome responsibility?
@AnneCW @DanPoelstra @GOP You are every bit the centrist Marx was.
@KoonsGlenn I never got the criticism of McConnell. He's been damned effective overall. Look at the confirmations of judges we've had thus far in '17 - a dozen circuit courts and a supreme. lots of CRA reg rollbacks. And he took the pancreas out of the body of Obamacare last night as well.
@KoonsGlenn it is a big win. it needs minor tweaks in conference. the Hillsdale amendment needs to be added back in. What the democrats did last night was slanderous. It was near blood libelous, actually.
@joeflyanderson I think you missed your chance to demonstrate you might know what the hell you're talking about.
@AnneCW Your leftist beliefs betray your centrist claims. What should the tax rate be if you were czaress?
@AnneCW @GOP What should the tax rate be?
@AnneCW That's the thing with you people on the left. I have a point of view different from yours and I'm therefore lying. I'm not accusing you of lying. You're just wrong, and apparently delusional. I'm very confident in my economic theory.
@AnneCW @GOP You poor delusional leftist. I hope you can find joy in a prospering country for the next few years.
@AnneCW Get used to being sick, then. Global economy and competition in the 50s aren't comparable to today.
@AnneCW It's worked every time it's been tried. Every time without fail.
@AnneCW Doubtful. Real growth will moderate estimated deficit. Now if we could have about 70 republicans tackle Medicare/Medicaid/Social Security, because Democrats will never be serious about it, the debt curve could finally be bent.
@AnneCW @GOP And your point? You have more net income. What you do with it is your choice. If prices go up, supply and demand will create equilibrium price. That's how it's supposed to work.
@elaundar Collectively, you're right. 49 republicans tried to bloc grant Medicaid to the states. The answer is more republicans and try again. Discretionary spending is a drop in the bucket to what's driving debt.
@AnneCW Yet you didn't seem concerned at all when Obamacare increased the deficit $2 trillion. You'll forgive me as I laugh at your selective macroeconomic fiscal concerns. Cuts stimulate growth. Growth increases revenues. If debt is your concern, let's talk entitlement reform.
@AnneCW @GOP No, I'd be screaming if the Democrats imposed new taxation, like they did with Obamacare. I'd cheer anyone rolling back taxes.
@elaundar I swear, you don't seem to want to talk about what is driving the debt, and that is runaway entitlements.
@AnneCW If being conned means enjoying a fraction more control over the money I earn, then I hope to be conned further.
@AnneCW @GOP Show me where it's constitutional for the government to compel people to buy something even if they don't wish it. Honestly, have you ever had an original thought? Or has NPR completely programmed you?
@AnneCW @GOP Polls showed Hillary Clinton was the next president. Fortunately, we don't do everything by polls. Not even the Democrats govern by polls. If they did, we never would have had Obamacare in the first place.
@AnneCW It could have passed 7 hours ago if Democrats weren't grandstanding. They were stalling when they knew they lost this one. Spare me the timing angst. You can do better than that.
@AnneCW I'm a voter. My wishes don't count? You seriously presume to know America wants the status quo on taxes? Mandate repeal is included because it is a tax. Obama administration and Supreme Court agreed it was. Of course, it should be here.
@elaundar I'm not buying the deficit will be that bad. Growth, real growth, solves a lot. If you to cut debt, cut entitlements. Debt problem isn't a lack of revenue problem. It's always been a spending problem.
@AnneCW What utter nonsense. The major chunks of this bill have been worked on for months. Honest question, yet not expecting an honest answer. Same bill, stalled for a week, voted in next Friday. Think 1 Democrat would have signed on? I don't.
@caminvan Nope.
@elaundar You want to cut the debt? Come talk to me when you get willingness from the left to go along with a 60 vote Medicare/Medicaid/social security overhaul.
@AnneCW I'm sorry you're disappointed. I'm even more sorry you have fallen for the spin the hysterical left has presented. I hope when the country thrives, your fog will be lifted.
@caminvan Obamacare was worse than this. Some democrats would have been on board with this had it not been for trump hatred. This package ain't perfect, but it's awfully good.
That's 51. Tax reform passes. On to Conference Committee. Thanks and congrats to McConnell, Cornyn, Thune and Toomey for getting through a pretty good bill overall.
Republicans are shaking hands as though tax reform is done. Vote is still open. Haven't seen McCain, yet. #LucyandtheFootball

Pat Toomey had the perfect response. We were not going to give in to demands that we make this a 60 vote threshold so that they could then hold tax cuts hostage via filibuster. It would have been legislative malpractice to do so.
Joe Manchin on the floor right now explaining that apparently, he no longer represents the mood of his constituency in West Virginia. Boasts of his bipartisanship by saying he's being partisan in opposing tax bill.

@VerneLaVurl @dotdash1961 @greekmary @NatashaBertrand @allahpundit Lastly, being the critical thinker you are, when you go back and read this thread, your rationality will of course show that every challenge you offered, I answered. You did not refute any response, other than to divert to something else.
@VerneLaVurl @dotdash1961 @greekmary @NatashaBertrand @allahpundit I feel very comfortable with how I'm working my way through our little intellectual exercise. What is a little ironic and wildly amusing is you telling me you teach critical thinking while chastising me about Tom Cotton's lack of qualifications for the CIA job.
@VerneLaVurl @dotdash1961 @greekmary @NatashaBertrand @allahpundit I have no animus against James Comey. The President has the Article II power under the Constitution to administer the executive branch, of which James Comey is a part. If he does not have that ability, we don't live in a constitutional republic.
@VerneLaVurl I sleep just fine with my choice. And I sleep especially well knowing that I don't feel the need to go on Twitter and tell someone I don't know that they voted the wrong way.
@VerneLaVurl Keep trying with that attempt. It's patently untrue. Again, if you want to be considered to be rational, perhaps you should work a little harder about demonstrating that ability.
@VerneLaVurl @dotdash1961 @greekmary @NatashaBertrand @allahpundit As for Russia, I have confidence in Bob Mueller. We'll see what he comes out with. If there's a problem with Trump, I'll gladly embrace Mike Pence. Again, you can come at me with everything you hate about Trump. I'll defend what's good, join you in what's bad.
@VerneLaVurl @dotdash1961 @greekmary @NatashaBertrand @allahpundit If the President cannot fire the top cop, then we really aren't in a constitutional republic anymore. That lack of ability by the president to fire means we are in a police state by definition.
@VerneLaVurl @dotdash1961 @greekmary @NatashaBertrand @allahpundit Absolutely, I can defend the Comey firing. We have a constitutional republic, right? We don't have a police state, nor do we want one. I would assume you being the patriot you are would agree. James Comey at FBI was the de facto top cop, right?
@VerneLaVurl @dotdash1961 @greekmary @NatashaBertrand @allahpundit What exactly am I doing to the US by having open policial dialogue? You do realize, of course, that there are many on my ideological side of the spectrum who say progressivism is ruining the US, right? Yet I'm not accusing you of ruining the US. I thought we were beyond vitriol?
@VerneLaVurl I was unaware that was my hot button legal case. I'd settle for Roe going away and having states decide abortion legality for themselves.
@VerneLaVurl Yes, i draw an equivalence between someone who talks like a cad, and very might have well acted as one, with someone who knowingly enabled sexual assault for her own political gain. You bet I do.
@VerneLaVurl My moral compass is perfectly fine, but thanks for your concern. If you can't conclude that Bill Clinton has his own sexual violence past that has never properly been adjudicated in the court of public opinion, then again, you cannot be engaged with in rational conversation.
@VerneLaVurl @dotdash1961 @greekmary @NatashaBertrand @allahpundit I was unaware I was attacking. Analysis isn't attacking. I'm not profane, I'm not maligning your service to the country. I'm concluding based on your timeline that you seem to dislike Trump to an absurd level, which is your right. Cotton is a traiter? That's trutherism territory.
@VerneLaVurl @dotdash1961 @greekmary @NatashaBertrand @allahpundit Okay, I thought you were rational. My mistake. You're embracing lunacy now. Have a nice day.
@VerneLaVurl ...that issue became moot. Neither candidate could claim a high or moral ground on that issue. So then in the final analysis, other issues became the deciding factor. Trump's judicial appointments alone were better than what we would have had with Hillary.
@VerneLaVurl My politics are not tribal at all. I want all sexual offenders gone from public service. I called for Trump to leave the campaign when the Access Hollywood video came out. Once the final two became Trump and his foibles and Hillary with her enabling of her rapist husband...
@VerneLaVurl Trump is a mixed bag. I analyze what comes out of him. The stuff that's off putting, I openly criticize. My timeline is full of said criticism. When he does stuff good, I praise the good. I'm just not going to get boxed into Bannonism or anti-Trumpism.
@VerneLaVurl The hate vids yesterday are indefensible. I wish he would stop tweeting. Or at least count to 10 first before acting on first impulse. His judicial picks have been stellar. his de-regulation measures have been stellar. His foreign speeches have been stellar.
@VerneLaVurl @dotdash1961 @greekmary @NatashaBertrand @allahpundit So now you're conflating qualifications for CIA chief with whether or not Trump should resign. I get it. You hate Trump. You are entitled to hate Trump. But your hatred is clouding your coherence. I didn't like Obama's choices. Elections have consequences, though.
@VerneLaVurl @dotdash1961 @greekmary @NatashaBertrand @allahpundit So if the President values his opinion on intelligence matters, how is he not qualified, again, other than just pure anti-Trump bias?
@VerneLaVurl @dotdash1961 @greekmary @NatashaBertrand @allahpundit So what exactly is the job of a CIA chief? It's to 1) provide intelligence analysis to the president, and 2) to go back to his staff and get answers to questions the president asks. It's a political appointment. He's shown no ill handling of intel.
@VerneLaVurl @dotdash1961 @greekmary @NatashaBertrand @allahpundit Sure. Army Ranger platoon leader. Dealt with sensitive intel all the time. Senate service on the Intel Committee. Deals with classified info daily. If appointed, he will be confirmed by a wide bipartisan vote in about a nanosecond.
And lefties wonder how Alabamians can support Roy Moore. All politics now are tribal. https://t.co/HV6nUQrHyr
@dotdash1961 @VerneLaVurl @greekmary @NatashaBertrand @allahpundit Only if you are willfully ignorant to your partisanship.
@cvangeezy @KopsMiss @NatashaBertrand @allahpundit Army Ranger, leading a platoon, all dealing with sensitive intelligence, service on the Senate Intel Committee, all dealing with classified intelligence. I was unaware I had to respond to all partisan ignorance.
@KopsMiss @NatashaBertrand @allahpundit Mattis, Pruitt, pompeo, Haley, McMaster, I can name lots, actually. Now if you're a partisan lefty, nothing will make you happy. But these are all great picks.
@NatashaBertrand @allahpundit This column is wholly nonsense. Tom Cotton is probably the most appropriate person besides Mike Pompeo to run the agency. What utter nonsense.
@DavidMDrucker I agree. With each drip, their 2018 wave dissipates. I'm not saying the GOP has clean hands at all. But their tortured response to what most Americans believe, that the creeps need to go, is going to deflate their midterm if they don't change course.
@ohkirsten Yup. The dirty rotten secret that the left will never own up to publicly is that the reason they are looking at their worst nightmare in President Trump is their refusal to clean their own house with the Clintons for decades.
And to be fair in context, allegations against Trump were neutralized in 2016 by allegations of Hillary Clinton enabling/abetting Bill Clinton behavior, so in Vegas terms, the issue was a push. Had a moral Democrat run, could have been a different outcome. https://t.co/OSwVfTKu0S

@Hirdman I looked it up. Spacey was a week and a half before Moore news broke. Like I said, you could be right. I really don't think so, though. this movement has achieved critical mass.
@Hirdman Not picking a nit, just trying to be accurate. the Kevin Spacey story was first reported on October 29th. The WaPo story starting the Roy Moore saga ran November 9th. Be careful not to underestimate the wave we're seeing here.
@marilynpstilwel You were saying? https://t.co/Yzppdb2EPZ
@MeTooSoon You were saying? https://t.co/Yzppdb2EPZ
@Hirdman The reason i disagree is this started well before roy moore. this started with weinstein and spacey.
@Hirdman I disagree with the end. There is no old norm for which to return. This is too widespread. Just wait until male professors in academia are metoo'ed. I think we are nearing the middle of the beginning of this, not the beginning of the end.
@CNNMoney @cnnbrk Which people has Lauer hurt, and about what behavior specifically is he truly sorry? This is Al Frankensque thus far.
@TODAYshow And to those yesterday who either victim blamed or assumed Lauer was innocent until proven guilty, I hope you are equally apologetic to who we are learning are multiple victims of his unacceptable behavior.
@TODAYshow I hope he seeks true redemption for the damage he's done. Part of that, of course, would be to admit what he's done, not say the stories are true enough.
Sure didn't sound like he's denying all of it, he's innocent, he's going to fighting this unjust firing in court. He did enough to get fired. https://t.co/Yzppdb2EPZ

@Chris41840866 Because NBC would not open themselves to the legal liability of a multimillion dollar wrongful termination suit if this was just a rumor. They'd get killed in court if they couldn't back this up. You'll notice no public denial from Lauer, yet. Early to be sure, but still...
We're all worried about being fired everyday just in the normal course of doing business. We don't have enough time to think about getting ourselves in trouble. https://t.co/sZNo3vEUzw
@Erik_Roberson Not inside info, just NBC believing at least one account of sexual impropriety with a co-worker that was enough to terminate a multimillion dollar contract.
@kylielosh Ok. We disagree.
@ajdre315 Am I condemning his mortal soul? Am I calling for his incarceration for his crimes? I thought I was feeling for the victim(s), who must have gone through hell. One can believe allegations if they ring true. It's not against the law to have opinions.
@MyKaleeStep Imagine how devastated the victim was. Empathy. Compassion. And yet, somehow in your fevered mind, you get to your word salad of a tweet in order to protect your warped ideological worldview. You just keep being you.
@MyKaleeStep And you're telling me I'm misconstruing this? I think you'd better go back and read, or better yet, find someone to explain to you what's going on here.
@Rosalinde_A @bobcatsteph3 Of course. If they just heard a rumor and fired him on it without any due diligence in house, the wrongful termination suit here would be staggering.
@MyKaleeStep What misinterpretation am I guilty of? Since when is it being high and mighty when your first thought at news like this is what the victim must have gone through?
@kylielosh I am not his attorney, nor would I accept him as a client if I were. Before you carry on with his defense, CNN, Variety, NY Times and Huffington Post all were working on Lauer stories with multiple victims for months before this NBC action today.
@agent_it Thanks. This really isn't a hard concept to grasp. It's only hard when someone of shared ideological bent gets caught. I'm apolitical when it comes to this stuff. I want all bad actors off the stage.
@Manfeelings90 There will be people whose lives are destroyed by false allegations. My experience is it's never one accuser that causes someone to fall. It's serial with these predators. Variety, NY Times and HuffPo all reporting that there are multiple victims in the case of Lauer.
@kylielosh If he is totally innocent and NBC fired him from a multimillion dollar contract wrongfully, he'll own them in court. If he's innocent, he'll file that suit against NBC by close of business today. Want to bet he probably doesn't file?
@kylielosh You are conflating legal judgment and discernment. I'm not calling for Lauer's incarceration. But just like OJ wasn't legally convicted of murdering his wife, I'm pretty sure he did it. I have discernment. You do, too, if you are honest.

@msmKnowHim I was unaware I raced to O'Reilly's defense. News to me. If you did a nanosecond of research, you'd discover rapidly that I'm for purging all creeps. I'm apolitical in that goal.
@BrianSweeneyPSU Judge, huh? I'm neither sentencing him to prison, nor am I condemning his eternal soul. All I said is imagine the devastation of the victim here. Silly me for trying to put myself in the shoes of victims of sexual violence for a mile.
@Manfeelings90 I suppose if you're correct and Lauer is innocent and being railroaded here, he's got a multimillion dollar wrongful termination suit open and shut. We'll see how fast he files it.
@ThCaptain @zwines Seems to me pretty clear that NBC came to the conclusion. Haven't heard anything since Monday night from Lauer saying whatever you hear, I didn't do it.
@bobcatsteph3 @TODAYshow I was unaware I told you how to feel. I was just imagining a world when the first reaction to these stories is not how we feel, but how the victims must have felt.
@GrandSuSu @TODAYshow Imagine how cruel is was for the victim of Lauer's actions.
@bobcatsteph3 @TODAYshow Imagine how devastated the victim was.

@RalphFriday72 @KurtSchlichter I'm more of a sausage biscuit with cheese kind of guy. Asked and answered that. I can't make you read. I can only encourage you to learn how.
@RalphFriday72 @KurtSchlichter You're slandering autistic people as dense and saying I'm belligerent? Keep working on your troll game. I'm sure there are plenty of subsets of people you haven't offended, yet.
@RalphFriday72 @KurtSchlichter That's interesting. I'm getting crap because I'm not embracing Moore, the non-establishment outsider. I confess I voted for Perot in '92, who if memory serves, was the non-establishment outsider. And no, I did not vote for McMullin. I voted for Trump.
@RalphFriday72 @KurtSchlichter What is it exactly you are saying now? Autistic people are dense? Pro tip: Stop when you're getting your ass handed to you.
@RalphFriday72 @KurtSchlichter Ah, more discernment. See? It's in there somewhere, deep below your desire to prove how little you know and how willing you are to be one of Steve Bannon's minions.
@RalphFriday72 @KurtSchlichter I don't share that generalization. I don't believe that all actors, once they get their SAG card, start sexualizing kids. Also don't believe all politicians are evil. Lincoln was pond scum? Washington? Churchill? Thatcher?
@SheboyganDude @KurtSchlichter It does, but true democracy in action, even in a democratic republic such as ours, is messy by definition.
@RalphFriday72 @KurtSchlichter I'm not defending a guy I liked. I'll give you a little hint, Sparky. I didn't vote for H.W. I voted for Perot. You are floundering now. I have one position. If they're creeps, I'm against them.
@RalphFriday72 @KurtSchlichter I have no idea what they knew and when they knew it. That wasn't your question. You asked what I thought about Bush and his issues. You're wandering around now. Might want to work on your ability, or lack thereof, to focus.
@SheboyganDude @KurtSchlichter I do not wish Jones to win. Someone that calls for abortion on demand up to the day of delivery is unacceptable. My position has been to expel Moore if he wins and force a do over.
@RalphFriday72 @KurtSchlichter So you get to determine on a case by case basis whether someone is striking a fake ass pose? My, it's almost as though you are trying to develop a sense of discernment. Keep working on it. You might one day apply it across the board.
@RalphFriday72 @KurtSchlichter I believe H.W. should apologize, as he's already done, by the way, and then stay off the public stage. Not sure what price a 93 year old wheelchair-bound ex-president can pay now. Again, this isn't legality to me. It's fitness for continued public service.
@KurtSchlichter I agree that may very well happen. The irony here would be that Nancy Pelosi would end up sealing the deal for Roy Moore. My larger point is our side embraces Moore at our own great peril. We're supposed to mock hypocrites, not become them.
@vjeannek @KurtSchlichter That's fair. They certainly have not produced much of a track record on trustability.
@vjeannek @KurtSchlichter They may not, which is why I hope if he's elected, Senate GOP expels him, forces Governor Ivey to appoint a replacement, start all over again.
@vjeannek @KurtSchlichter corruption is indeed a problem. I'd say your 85% number seems a bit high to me.
@RalphFriday72 @KurtSchlichter nice try. now you're dodging. not the question i asked. both WaPo stories - Moore and Rose, were remarkably similar - both well-reported - lots of on the record names/quotes. "our" side had no problem w/Rose story, didn't want to believe the Moore story. Both stories are solid.
@vjeannek @KurtSchlichter lots of evidence they do boot out their bad actors. let's see if the Senate GOP expels Moore if he wins. I think whatever political price they pay with the Steve Bannon base is worth it in the long run.
@vjeannek @KurtSchlichter Al Franken today said he was ashamed, but that he's going back to work. Both of those cannot be so in the same sentence. If one is ashamed of one's behavior, they leave the public stage. Going back to work by definition means he's not ashamed.
@vjeannek @KurtSchlichter they should be as well. The left doesn't traditionally have the same value set Republicans do. We have a long history of flushing out our bad actors. It takes legal action for the left to do so.
@vjeannek @KurtSchlichter not thinking that's much of a kick. a 70 year pervert as a rookie senator? not thinking that's going to turn washington on its head. he won't get committee assignments, will be shunned by vast majority of the conference. He'll be a pariah.
@KurtSchlichter I agree pain is a prerequisite all too many times before people learn their lesson and change. I have no problems adopting some of the tactics of our opponents. Rallying around people you know deep down are rotten for party politics isn't one I'm hip on.
@RalphFriday72 @KurtSchlichter Was the Washington Post story on Charlie Rose believable when the story first came out, before Charlie Rose was suspended or responded?
@Jckluge Sure I do. I read. Lots of things. You should try it sometime.
@RalphFriday72 @KurtSchlichter Then line up and support every underage predator you find running for office, sir. I'm not going to stop you. Bring your young daughter to meet him. Have someone on her signed. Just deal me out. I don't do creeps of either party.
@Jckluge I watched zero minutes of that trial. saw no evidence. I still believe he did it. I'm neither his judge nor his God here. I'm not attempting to incarcerate him, nor am I condemning his soul. I still believe he has a long career of predatory behavior to underage girls. Deal me out
@RalphFriday72 @KurtSchlichter what, where democrats flushed out their own bad people? nope. they don't. that's what used to be different about the parties. the GOP used to flush out their bad actors. long history of it, in fact.
@Jckluge I believe OJ killed his wife. I have no legal proof. I'm not virtue signalling. I know when things are believable or not, despite political leanings. But you keep backing Moore. Count me out. He should get zero party help, zero committee assignments.
@Jckluge this isn't a legal or court issue. I have something you apparently don't - discernment. I know when stuff rings true or not. You seem to have that decision making process deeply hidden beneath political biases. Party on.
@Jckluge I don't think he's going to be a good senator. I don't believe anyone who has a thing for underage girls, or boys for that matter, has any business being anywhere near public office. But that's just me.
@RalphFriday72 @KurtSchlichter oh, i don't know, Mark Foley, Larry Craig, Bob Livingston, Newt Gingrich...
@KurtSchlichter He might be a senator. I don't want to say hi to him. don't want to be anywhere near him. especially don't want my daughter or granddaughter anywhere near him. I want the creeps of both sides gone.

@michaelbeck you know the world series was like six months ago, right?
@hughhewitt I don't care if they 3d print drones. If they 3d print brains that auto fly those drones, that seems to me something that shouldn't be for general public consumption. there's a difference between recreational drone flying and weaponizing. weaponizing should be illegal.
@politicsofone no, it's not. There are a myriad of weapons the military has that the general public has no business owning.
6. It's also the same nonsensical argument with the banning guns argument. You can ban the AI drone technology. The genie is already out of the bottle. It exists. Those who would desire to use it to kill won't not acquire them because they're suddenly illegal.
5. I'm perfectly fine with a ban on AI-flown drones for public consumption. The thrill of drone flying, for me, is that I get to fly stuff. If Artificial intelligence is flying it, there's no recreational reason for me to own one anyway.
4. Me flying a drone in a park because it's fun should be banned because someone might deploy an AI drone army and destroy a city? That means we need to ban all future cars/trucks because they could be weaponized and outfitted with AI. You know that won't happen, either.
A few points on the nano-terminators video. 1. I hope the military has this capability. Makes North Korea/Iran a lot easier. 2. There are lots of toys the military has that the public shouldn't have. 3. using any weapon to kill or terrorize, I thought, was already illegal.

@michaelbeck well, they may and may not. if the heat stays on, with midterms coming up, it's a safe vote for all to expel. Franken is extremely expendable. Mark Dayton would replace him with a lefty in a second, so it's an easy vote to boot him.
@michaelbeck I know. If I knew the Senate would follow through, which I'm skeptical, I'd say vote for him knowing the Senate would expel, and force the governor's hand to appoint a replacement.

@jackbutler4815 @hughhewitt @MarlonBateman @seanleavey18 Alas, a Disney stupidity record I don't possess.
@AdamBaldwin I fail to see where this has anything whatsoever to do with the state and local income tax deduction. Now if this stunt happened to be performed in California, it might be an opinion of that provision of the tax reform bill.
@ReynardMiri @philipaklein he's losing ground in each successive poll that comes out. The only way he wins is if Alabamans collectively decide they hate the media more than they hate child molesters.
@KurtSchlichter it's as though avoiding "appearance of impropriety" is a concept that it too hard to grasp.
@darrenmalia You're done with me? Now I can enjoy my life.
@ReynardMiri @philipaklein Dude, it's so over they'll need dental records to identify the campaign corpse.
So that's that. Neither Trump nor Ivey want political blood on their hands. Moore gets beat by double digits, Heller loses in 2018 in Nevada. That means GOP must gain one net seat next november or stagnation for two years. Thanks, Steve Bannon. https://t.co/WXxO9eo2tv
RT @JonahNRO: Now make that argument about guns -- which are actually mentioned prominently in the Constitution. https://t.co/zB0RziYpxS
@philipaklein Fortunately, Moore will lose by double digits, so we'll never know.
@darrenmalia I called for Trump to step down after the Access Hollywood tape. I'm thrilled beyond belief that he beat Hillary, who would have crippled the country.
@darrenmalia @_ericcardenas @FoxNews yes, moron. And again, you didn't read the rest of the tweet, which says AND the Senate should immediate expel him.
@michaelbeck she won't act until she calculates the lefty fringe base bails out on franken. then she will stand up with courage...not.
@michaelbeck they'll hide behind ethics committee investigation and hope another shoe doesn't drop. if one does, then he's expendable. meanwhile, Moore loses, Heller loses, we go into 2019 with 50-50 Senate unless we have pickups elsewhere in 2018.
@DoctorBonesaw @kasie @hardball_chris I also showed reports from MSNBC saying dems were running from the cameras to avoid commenting on franken. I backed up my claim with MSM reporting.
@_ericcardenas @FoxNews You're special thinking I'm a trump crony. No one has been harder on Roy Moore than me online.
@DoctorBonesaw CNN’s Borger on Al Franken: ‘I Don’t Doubt His Remorse at All ... He Is Suffering Tremendously’ @BrookeBCNN @GloriaBorger https://t.co/gfQC5IVRZL  check out about 2 minutes in where Gloria says Dems say investigate and then run away as a dodge.
@SpeakServeGrow I agree that Roy Moore's alleged offenses are worse than Franken's thus far. I also believe there will be more on Franken to follow. It's never a one-off with creeps. I'm willing to cast aside creeps on my side. Are you just as willing to be consistent?
@Sephmac @kasie @hardball_chris yeah, about that. CNN's Gloria Borger, not exactly a righty, said Dems will say investigate this and then run away from the issue. CNN’s Borger on Al Franken: ‘I Don’t Doubt His Remorse at All ... He Is Suffering Tremendously’ @BrookeBCNN @GloriaBorger https://t.co/gfQC5IVRZL
@SpeakServeGrow make no mistake. Roy Moore should go away and stay there...by himself. i have no use for Roy Moore at all. I just wish the left were as consistent with their bad actors. They simply aren't.
@SpeakServeGrow @kasie @hardball_chris Chuck Schumer said this was unacceptable. McConnell said Roy Moore should get out of the campaign. Cory Gardner, chair of NRSC, the election arm of the Senate Republicans, said we should expel him if he wins. Haven't seen one Senate Dem tell Al to get out.
@DoctorBonesaw MSNBC’s Kasie Hunt: ‘Democrats, Quite Frankly, Were Running Away from Our Cameras Today’ @kasie @hardball_chris https://t.co/8BxZW1Fzk2 Now you'll excuse me, Leninist, if I don't shut up, despite whether i procreate or not.
@SpeakServeGrow unacceptable doesn't mean get out. Senate republicans have told Roy Moore to get out, or we'll throw you out. This really isn't hard to get. But you go ahead.
@darrenmalia I'll settle for one tweet saying Bill Clinton should have been removed from office after what he did. Just one. Since you're whattabouting with Trump, let's talk presidents.
@affbeginner @darrenmalia So according to your definition of bias, one is not biased only if Bill Clinton is excluded in any conversation about sexual impropriety? Good to know.
@SpeakServeGrow MSNBC’s Kasie Hunt: ‘Democrats, Quite Frankly, Were Running Away from Our Cameras Today’ @kasie @hardball_chris https://t.co/8BxZW1Fzk2
@Sephmac With all due respect, perhaps you should get out more. MSNBC’s Kasie Hunt: ‘Democrats, Quite Frankly, Were Running Away from Our Cameras Today’ @kasie @hardball_chris https://t.co/8BxZW1Fzk2
@darrenmalia Seriously, what in the hell are you talking about? I tweeted about the Senate - one candidate, one sitting. You whattaboutism into Trump, and call me the partisan? I might be a while. I'll be going through your timeline to see your criticism of Bill Clinton back to '96.
@Sephmac What is totally false? The part about Senate Republicans running away from Roy Moore, or Senate Democrats literally running away from media so as to not have to say whether Al Franken should go?
@darrenmalia Then expel Donald Trump from the Senate.
Senate Republicans: We believe the women accusing Roy Moore of misconduct and we want nothing to do with Roy Moore. Senate Democrats: We believe the picture showing misconduct by Al Franken, and, well, um, er...
@JoyAnnReid @thedailybeast "basic pro-choice" position of abortion on demand up to day of delivery is radical, Joy. Come on.

@alibertarian @SenatorStrange He could. If he resigned, Kay Ivey could have a replacement there in 24 hours.
RT @hughhewitt: J. Pepper Bryars: What this pro-life, deeply conservative and anti-establishment Alabama voter decided about Roy Moore http…
Well, Congress, since Roy Moore isn't getting out, and @SenatorStrange won't go, either, looks like you'd better try out that whole 24/7 thing between now and December 12th, because with only 51 in the Senate on the 13th, tax reform isn't going to get done without it.
So how was school today, dear? Great, dad. I got called out of class to the principal's office. Why is that, dear? Because Roy Moore called and asked me out on a date. He's a dream. https://t.co/1JS6ZWVBK8
@JonahNRO Don't you mean whelp?
@ongrd2 @PolitiBunny Tell you what. You go ahead and defend Roy Moore all you want. Count me out. I've seen enough. Oh, by the way, there's another accusation from another one out today. My guess is it won't be the last. But you go ahead and defend him.
@JBuggarauf @dave_usmc Which hill is better? The one that's not currently being held by a creepy perv. I still don't want that hill.
@nadinecarroll It's not a McConnell thing. If @SenatorStrange gets out, Kay Ivey appoints a temporary replacement. McConnell has nothing to do with it. Spare me your talking points.
@ongrd2 @PolitiBunny No one is saying incarcerate him. Again, this isn't a legal thing. It's a political thing. You are allowed to move away from someone you know deep down is creepy.
@jtinfo @dave_usmc And by the way, this option doesn't preclude Roy Moore from running again for the nomination. He certainly can. I would hope that Alabama GOP would not make that mistake again, but it's not taking the matter out of voter hands at all. They ultimately will decide.
@jtinfo @dave_usmc There is. @senatorstrange can resign. He is done December 13th as it is. If he resigns now, kay Ivey picks a replacement, voiding the December 12 election and starting the process over. New primary, new general election in '18. It's the best way forward.
@Katvat77 Since you are a multi-generational native Alabaman, I will try to use small words. My hunch on if Roy did it isn't a court or jury thing. It would be bad, very bad, for the GOP to wrap their arms around one who is doing a bad job saying he's not a creep.
@jtinfo @dave_usmc I don't, either. That's why I hope @SenatorStrange takes one for the team and resigns now, two weeks early, and creates a vacancy that can stop the election and create a do-over.
@jtinfo @dave_usmc if they want to take the pedophile hill, they can have it. I really don't want it.
@Katvat77 The same way I know OJ murdered his wife. Human beings do have something other animals don't - discernment. The Roy Moore debacle is a political question, not a legal question. You can conclude based upon what's currently known.
All this is true. It also does not mean Roy Moore is the hill on which to die. https://t.co/SwLqYoU4cn
@EliLake five will get you ten that in the end, it turns out that bannon's behind it.
@KrussowAlice @TheRickWilson An honorable man doesn't propose to support infanticide up to the day of delivery. What is wrong with you? You really believe a baby 1 day before delivery isn't a person? If he wins, he will be a placeholder for 2 years until Alabama elects a Republican.
@TheRickWilson if anything good comes out of this debacle in alabama, it's that bannon is becoming a pariah. he's lost mercer, he just lost adelson. Hopefully he'll fade into irrelevancy.
@ConservativeLA Rats can swim, right?
@ConservativeLA And Steve Bannon is still claiming this is a coordinated attack between the WaPo and "McConnell lackies". I was unaware the reach and breadth of McConnell's power into the newsrooms of Alabama.
@KoonsGlenn Seriously, if you are sticking with Roy Moore at this point, I really want nothing to do with you further. There's legal proof, and there's basic human discernment. If you do not possess the latter, no longer worth the discussion.
@dougbentley They might, and then they might not. If they're challenging, they're basically defending Roy Moore, aren't they? Not sure they really want to do that. They think they're getting Senate back in '18 anyway, so why go all out here?
@ConservativeLA This just feels more like a coordinated "October surprise" in November. Human discernment can tell most times if stuff rings true. All this around Moore does ring true.
@darrenmalia You want to be opportunistic and get a Democrat in there any way possible. I get that. You're partisan. I want to keep Republicans in power and ditch Moore any way possible. If Moore gets elected and expelled, or not seated in the first place, so be it.
@dougbentley if he steps down, we have a vacancy. The governor has the ability to temporarily appoint a replacement to fill the vacancy. That replacement has to have the ability to campaign and run to be confirmed by the voters of the state.
The worse this Roy Moore story gets, and it'll keep getting worse, the more I want to go home and hug my kids, and take down anyone else that attempts to do the same.
@darrenmalia if I really wanted to do whataboutism, I'd have brought up the NY Daily News yesterday on Bob Menendez underage hooker problem, and how not one Democrat is calling on him to get out.
@darrenmalia if you're going to paraphrase what i said, perhaps you should paraphrase all of what i said, moron. I said if he doesn't quit and strange doesn't get out, yes, he should be elected long enough to be thrown out so that Ivey can name a successor. Honestly, this isn't hard.
@darrenmalia Tell you what, lefty. We'll take care of the Roy Moore problem. Why don't you take care of your Bill Clinton problem. That'll occupy a lot of your time.
@darrenmalia which moral equivalence? If Strange doesn't bow out, and Moore doesn't quit, i hope Moore wins, either doesn't get seated or expelled. Best way to keep him from serving and a Democrat from winning. Easy call. Democrats aren't the solution here.
Dear @SenatorStrange, please, for the sake of all that left of the good and holy within the Republican Party, resign today. Create the vacancy. Save the Senate, the country and nation from a nightmare scenario on December 12th. You will be remembered as doing a noble thing.
@KurtSchlichter i'm fairly confident Judge Moore won't exactly dig the discovery phase. You're right. not happening.
Remember long ago when Andrew Breitbart used the powers of https://t.co/kM2OnB4DWP to out Anthony Weiner for the predator he was? That's not apparently the mission of https://t.co/kM2OnB4DWP now, sadly. Andrew is spinning in his grave so fast as to be deemed hydraulic fracking.
Notice this report isn't that Bannon is sending people to report/investigate what's going on down there. He has his desired outcome - search and destroy credibility of the victims. I seem to remember conservatives blasting Hillary Clinton for doing same with bimbo eruption squad. https://t.co/LZpmeKlHgW
@clayranck Perhaps you missed the first line of my original tweet. This is the least worst option here.
@clayranck then that process can play itself out. If after all is known now the Alabama GOP voters are that suicidal politically, so be it. Avoid disaster now, however.
@clayranck remains to be seen. My guess is by the time the primary process results in an election for the nomination, Roy Moore's stock falls.
RT @ConservativeLA: Listening to "Harlan County Line" by Dave Alvin on #DuaneFM, and you are not.
I've got to give @hughhewitt credit. This is by far the least worst Hail Mary pass available for 'Bama. @SenatorStrange, himself a fill-in appointee, steps down before December 12th. Kay Ivey appoints new senator. Election is void, process to replace begins anew. Do over.
@EricRinehart33 Fact of the matter is Doug Jones is on record, on video, claiming he's all for abortion on demand up to the day of delivery. Sorry, that's infanticide, no matter how you slice it, stab it, or vacuum it out.
@EricRinehart33 Show me a modern day Democrat who is as pro-life as Rubio and then we can have that conversation. They don't exist.
@EdMorrissey Dear Anthony, I am a 74 year old German named Gunther. I would be pleased to talk about stuff...
@darrenmalia I said if allegations bear out, least bad option is for Moore to win, get expelled by Senate, replaced by governor.
@darrenmalia 1. Alleged child molester. 2. Democrat advocates for murder old unborn up to day of delivery. If you are morally consistent, no improvement.
@SheboyganDude I took it as snark, which is perfectly fine. Was looking for a way of presenting a summation tweet. DIAF just seemed to work.
@darrenmalia Since you are apparently unable or unwilling to read all the way through, perhaps you could invite someone to finish reading for you.
@SheboyganDude Point taken. Although I do seem to recall in Revelation that God got a nit persnickety about people adding or subtracting from the Bible.
Here's who can die in a fire: 		Roy Moore (if allegations bear out)	Defenders saying it was consensual	Defenders citing biblical precedent for young girl attraction	defending/excusing Bill Clinton hypocrites	GOP/WaPo conspiracy theorists		Here's who can stay: 		Everyone else.
@darrenmalia He very well might be. If he is, the answer is to expel him from the Senate. The answer isn't to elect a Democrat who avowedly supports murder on demand for unborn life up to the day of delivery.
And if Moore does not bow out, then he should still get elected, because it's too late to replace him, and the Senate should immediately expel him if the allegations against him bear out. Kay Ivey would still replace him with an appointee. It's the least bad way out of this.
@GlenT15 Right. If Moore does not do that, then he should still get elected, because it's too late to replace him, and the Senate should immediately expel him if the allegations against him bear out. Kay Ivey would still replace him with an appointee. It's the least bad way out of this.
If Roy Moore had any party loyalty and/or humility, he would deny the charges and announce that once elected, he'll step down and allow Kay Ivey to appoint a successor in order to A) clear his name, B) not have a cloud having over Alabama and the GOP, &amp; C) not have a Democrat win

@michaelbeck @hughhewitt I apparently missed my court martial hearing.
@Botany_Bae It's almost like my tweet sailed over your head and left a chemtrail.
@brandenmeade It's a problem in that Republicans have to figure out a way to win more votes in those counties. It's not a cheating thing. I've already said that. I'm writing as a Republican telling Republicans what they need to do to get back to winning in Virginia.
@tjhansen You're missing the point. It's not a complaint. I'm simply saying that until the GOP figures how better to compete in those counties, they'll continue to lose there,
@michnic70 I said nothing about cheating at all. It's about political strategy. If Republicans want to win in Virginia again ever, they need to do a better job in Northern Virginia. It's really not controversial.
@motrbotr Longer tweets are carpools. more content per car. Longer tweets are better for the environment, apparently.
@motrbotr That's like telling someone merging onto a freeway widened with four new lanes to keep driving only where the trucks go.
@motrbotr Talk to Twitter about that.
@JamusLynch @JonesPete yeah, 2016 was uglier than it had been even in 2012. Part of that is Trump spent zero time here, and lots of Republicans have left the state for lower tax states.
@JonesPete @JamusLynch if you look at the virginia county map, it's virtually a red state with pockets of blue. Granted, those pockets tend to have bunches of people in them. I'm talking electoral strategy. used to be that if you carried rural VA, it would overcome N. Va. No more.
@NoChromeHD Well now, i'm sure the Democrats running the Dominion will get right on that, won't they? 😜
@JonesPete @JamusLynch no, i'm saying that much more time/resources have to go into Northern Virginia. If they don't do a better job of upping percentage there, rest of the state that goes their way won't be enough to win. This isn't controversial stuff, actually.
@brianandmari I'm not. just like in california, orange county and san diego still exist. But you can't ignore the sheer numbers of votes out of those two counties, and which way they vote. Unless GOP does better job chipping away at that vote, not enough in the rest of the state to pull it off
@JamusLynch I'm not saying anything is wrong with voter concentration in certain areas. Just noting that for any Republican to win in Virginia these days, you have to crack that two-county bubble and make inroads or it's a non-starter. same as California.
@EricDonderoR Well now, that would take someone other than Democrats in power in Virginia legislature and governor's office to make that happen, wouldn't it?
Virginia now has a California problem. Virginia is essentially a red state with two blue counties - Fairfax and Loudoun, where most of the people live. California is a red state with two blue bubbles - LA and Bay Area, where most of the people live.
Trump has now created a higher noise floor, or white noise, in every major race in the country. Unless a Republican candidate can show a personality, hopefully with accomplishments, above that noise floor, which Gillespie couldn't, Trump will be what people vote on.
@lubertdas Ed ran on Virginia state issues. He ran on policy. NE Virginia voted on personality - Trump's. He wasn't running on a GOPe platform. He ran on solid Virginia conservative issues. We agree that all races in 2018 are national issues because of Trump now. That's the takeaway.
@demewill79 Then say hello to split government and Dem rule in 2020, because if nothing gets passed, we're doomed.
@michaelbeck but i'm countering by saying they are in the same boat in that Trump's rhetoric has an expiration date if there's no accomplishments to go along with it. Same for DC GOP. they have to pass and have the country improve. benefits all of them.
@demewill79 of course there is. 1. Obamacare repeal. still has to happen. 2. tax reform. 3. all of Trump's reg reform EO's have to be codified and passed as law, or else next POTUS can undo it all again. Lots they have to do still.
@CalamityDC That's what I said. he got mischaracterized by both side, and he couldn't overcome it. His mistake, if there is one here, is that he ran a campaign on policy. The state voted on personality. Not Gillespie or Northam's mind you, Trump's.
@demewill79 Uh, not sure what you're talking about. I just said all Republicans up for election in 2018 are imperiled if Congress doesn't start passing stuff.
@RichLowry When Donna is having a robust debate with her own book, that's never a good sign, is it? Shouldn't it be up to other people to create controversy about one's book?
@RuthAnneAdams @hughhewitt 'zactly.
@talkradio200 @michaelbeck Kristol, Goldberg, The Rick Wilson, oodles. I'm friends with lots of them. Never means never with them.
@RuthAnneAdams @hughhewitt Certainly. I'd also like Twitter to not play favorites ideologically, Silicon Valley to not be rich leftist hippies, and Hollywood to not be creepy pervs. But alas, I merely am tasked with radio show production and Hughniverse pontification.
The disturbing aspect of the Virginia race is Ed Gillespie actually campaigned as typically you're supposed to. He avoided national stuff as much as possible and traveled the state, shook hands, talked local issues. The state voted nationally, not locally. That's the Trump effect
@RuthAnneAdams @hughhewitt all donations are being matched internally with ADF and a donor.
As for Virginia as the bellwether, my guess is if Congressional Republicans, mostly senators, had done Obamacare repeal, the race would have been much closer. All GOP races in 2018 are imperiled if DC GOP doesn't step up their game. Pass stuff.
The Democrats successfully painted Ed Gillespie as a mini-Trump, and the Beltway Dems in NE Virginia turned out. Trump voters viewed Ed as establishment and didn't turn out. Neither portrait of Ed was accurate or fair, but resulted in 9 point loss.
@michaelbeck Agreed, but they're in the same boat. Performance and positive outcomes of policy cures a lot of ills.
@michaelbeck If he gets foreign policy wins (ISIS, Iran, North Korea, etc), and the economy continues to improve and people have more spending money, he'll coast. If not, he's out. That simple.
@michaelbeck To be fair, that damage is done. If he were to stop tweeting and act positively Reaganesque from here on out, A) the left will recycle the mountains of 2017 material incessantly, and B) the NeverTrumpers will never not be NeverTrumpers.
@michaelbeck partly yes. If the economy stays at or near 3% from here on out to 2020, due partly to tax cuts and regs rollback, I think that takes care of most of his personal foibles. The scoreboard won't lie in 2020.

He wanted it to look like a terrorist attack. If there's dozens of victims, it would be hard to pin on him. That's evil, but very sane. 9)
@ConservativeLA courage, sir. i'm doing a twitter psych analysis of him, not all atheists in general.
That's when he ate a bullet instead of pulling a grand finale gunfight. Bottom line is I don't think he wasn't insane. He was just evil. 8)
Only thing he didn't calculate was neighbor would be A)Texas, and B) armed. When he got hit twice in that getaway, he knew he was done. 7)
He had extra weapons in his vehicle in case the police found him and he was cornered. He figured he could go out in a blaze of glory.  5)
If you take out the entire church and then bail, by the time police arrive, you're long gone. Only thing he didn't count on was neighbor. 5)
...he was atheist already, so no moral issue for him, and the church was in the boonies. would take 5-10 minutes for police to respond.  4)
Dress up in black, cover your face with a mask, go in and wipe out a public venue she's probably going to be at. Church worked, because 3)
He's estanged from his wife's family, and makes the calculation M-I-L has to go. He also doesn't want to go to jail for it. So he plans. 2)

Thanks for a very entertaining season and postseason, MLB. You survived 2017 with only one asshole kneeling. Go @Angels in '18.
I don't think people will ever truly appreciate the job Morton has done shutting down the Dodgers offense, starting/relieving. Should be MVP
All-time offensive World Series to be sure. But if you had to pick a pitcher as Series MVP, has to be Morton, right?
Verlander is in the pen. He's not coming in for the save. This is psyops to keep the Dodgers defeated. It he was, Morton wouldn't be hitting
@CCC6 Ah, there it is.
@AndrewCMcCarthy I think you're right, but in the 1st, especially this team, it's nuts to get defeatist.

7 in the books. Crowd sits down quiet as things looking bleak at the Ravine. Keuchel more than likely being tapped for the six out save.
I keep reminding myself I'm not rooting for the Dodgers, but you to see them score a couple here to build the drama for an epic 9th, right?
Now Jansen on in the 7th. Game 7 almost always forces multiple players are used in bizarre circumstances.
@SherryTerm They're playing this way, yes.
@clminakowski If Barnes had bunted, ethier's hit scores two. Just sayin'.
@SherryTerm Don't think so
McCann cost his pitcher a strikeout there. Way too much glove movement. Pitch was a strike, glove movement fooled umpire.
Don't suppose Barnes could bunt and have a hit score two, could he? Nah, this is 2017. Screw that. Go for the 3-run tater.
Another sign it's Game 7 - back to back intentional walks by relief pitcher Clayton Kershaw.
Not piling on, but it's one thing to be down 5 if you're hitless. It hurts more stranding 8 so far. Dodgers have had chances.
Puig sure wants that pitch back. He missed source he could have driven a long way.
Dodgers really need to start chipping away here to make this interesting. Got lucky with Turner's grounder with eyes.
@bedfordguy The gods are putting their money on extra innings tonight. They don't care about who wins. They just want long, drama-filled escapism.
@ConservativeLA she's blocked me. i know she said something outrageous, but I can't determine what she actually said.
Yet both teams are playing this AL style - go station to station, wait for the long ball. Very unusual, but wildly entertaining Series. 5)
Normally, NL teams having to get around pitcher's spot and weak hitting catchers have to creatively move runners along, play for 1 run. 4)
That said, both teams are not playing NL baseball, which is little ball. No bunts, hitting behind runners, hit/runs, etc.   3)
Houston was a NL team before baseball restructured a few years ago. So they have more of a history with the Dodgers than with AL teams. 2)
Just told @hughhewitt during the break. The thing about this series is both teams are basically NL teams playing AL baseball. 1)
@ProGenitor09 nope. if you do that, then every record for pitchers all-time instantly becomes meaningless.
Sorry, 'Stros, the baseball gods were not to be denied. This series had to go 7. Everyone is available tomorrow night. Lock and load.
Impossible task for Maeda. Throw strikes to Altuve in a place where he can't hit it very hard.
@ConservativeLA mounds and almond joys are the worst. they always guaranteed a toilet papering in response to such a heinous act.

@michaelbeck @ConservativeLA @CG_Cynic All i'm telling you is Verlander didn't get through 6 in game 2. he got lit deep twice, 3 runs overall. not certain he'll be lights out.
RT @allahpundit: Just watched MLB’s Game 5 highlight reel. IT WAS 87 MINUTES LONG.
@allahpundit Wonder which major news outlet is going to look up Cory Feldman for comment on this revelation.
A fine take of the game last night. https://t.co/sMfcDdhIrP That game was more entertaining than anything out of Hollywood since Rogue One.
@ConservativeLA @michaelbeck @CG_Cynic i saw some good sliders, and i saw some really horrible ones. there were oodles of pitches by both pens in the happy zone - middle in.
@ConservativeLA yup. He's using his coming out as a cover/diversion from the perversion and illegality. So far, no one's really buying it.
@ConservativeLA Could care less about his gender preference. I care a lot about his apparent age preference, being that it's illegal. Hope that's not lost.
So that best actor Oscar for Kevin Spacey for American Beauty, perving on his teen daughter's best friend, isn't creepier at all now, is it?
Didn't think game 2 could be topped. Game 5 did just that. See you in LA Tuesday night.
@tarzanajoe All-nighter...again.
We are getting to the point where you calculate how long the game is by measurable Justin Turner beard growth.
@clminakowski They did. They exhausted their schedule for that hour.
Tried to tell you this had to go extras. But did you believe me? Nope.
@Iou09154609 Verlander pitches the 11th. I'm calling it now.
@CG_Cynic @Mr_Fastbucks @talkradio200 After the next hurricane hits.
Remember back 20 runs and 3 hours ago when Gurriel clanked that throw to second on a botched pickoff? Houston would be celebrating w/out it.
But of course. We are tied.
@CG_Cynic @talkradio200 @Mr_Fastbucks It is. I spent 20 years pitching in games like this. Believe it or not, I pitched a 2-1 win in 10 innings once.
If turner gets a pitch to hit with 1st open, Houston's pitching coach should be disbarred for malpractice.
@CCC6 Isn't that what got Harvey in trouble to begin with, sir?
@CCC6 And I never even produced a Hollywood movie, sir.
Fox came back from the break showing the box score. Looks more like two games of Barack Obama bowling.
@CCC6 Hater.
@CG_Cynic @ConservativeLA @Mr_Fastbucks @michaelbeck @talkradio200 There was no reason to yank wood after giving up one hit, even if it was a solo homer. They pulled rich hill early, too.
20 dingers thus far in this series, one shy of the record set in 2002. Fox commits grievous sin of omission that the Angels won that year.
@billpostradio He's paying the price now for overworking the pen earlier in the series.
@JDHadidian Heh
@JDHadidian Historic Dodgers pen can't buy an out now. Another 5 runs so far in 2+ innings.
@JDHadidian It ain't over. I don't see LA going down quietly in the last two innings, but they need to stop the bleeding.
come on, this game has to go extras, doesn't it?
In the last two innings, 11 runs have been scored combined in a World Series game. That's like the global warming of offense.
If you had a Kershaw/Keuchel game going into 6 tied at 7, you win. You're on crack for making that bet, but you're a winner nonetheless.
RT @BobsFunGirl: What's the word I'm looking for after that inning?	SHEESH.	@Radioblogger @ConservativeLA https://t.co/HYUJbXsz2Q
@Tsglover What can I say? Apparently Maeda likes tie games.
@williampettis That tweet didn't age very well, did it?
Right down the middle of the plate. straight fastball, no movement, literally dissecting the plate belt high. Sheesh.
Whatever pitch that was, probably a good idea not to throw that there again, unless you like tie games.
@talkradio200 @ConservativeLA @CG_Cynic @michaelbeck as much as they shatter, seems dumb to even try that.
@SherryTerm I'm one of "those" people - a conservative.
Out. Of. Gas.
@ProGenitor09 Just remember '02, baby.
@greifer nope. not his zone. he's only calling plate and about a ball width in.
I know that curve was a strike and had a big break to it, but it was right down the middle of the plate. That screamed hit me.
@ProGenitor09 No, I meant make room on the couch. I'm an Angels fan, so nothing makes me happier than NY and BoSox sitting this one out, too.
@greifer every fastball is belt high or higher right now from Kershaw. He's asking to get clobbered. And he can't throw his curve for a strike.
@ProGenitor09 And thank all that is holy for that. Scoot over and make room for the Red Sox, if you don't mind.
@stephenkruiser He's nowhere near as sharp at he was first 3 innings. He's throwing now, not pitching.
@CG_Cynic @talkradio200 @michaelbeck @ConservativeLA Seriously, tho, quality of pitching isn't what it once was. Someday, someone'll make a YouTube of pitch locations of homers. Lotsa cookies.
If i'm Roberts, i yank Kershaw here. He's  only at 70 pitches, Saves him for an outing in Game 7, and he's lost his stuff.
@talkradio200 @CG_Cynic @michaelbeck @ConservativeLA Offense sells more than pitching duels in today's ADD world.
@talkradio200 @CG_Cynic @michaelbeck @ConservativeLA Nope. People have tried to say all year that players are being trained to uppercut more efficiently. I say the ball is juiced/wound tighter.
@greifer Oh, hell, in games like this, I don't care if they're five hour jobs. This is epic. Please, someone, anyone, tell me baseball is boring.
@ProGenitor09 Did you see Bellinger put his finger to his lips to shhh the crowd after his homer? He should suspended for offending the mute-Americans.
@greifer And you know we're not done, yet. The Dodgers' pen has been less than stellar thus far in the Series.
That curve was what we in the ump biz call a hanger.
Are you freaking kidding me? Wow, what a series.
@CG_Cynic He hasn't missed one in that spot. By the 5th, you have to know that.
@SherryTerm Alas, damnable 140 character limit. If I was a beta candidate and had 280, Vinny and W. and H.W. make the tweet.
Hernandez can squawk, but that pitch has been called a strike all night. They have TV cameras. Adjust on offense, pitch there on defense.
You do know that when we get to extra innings in L.A. for Game 7, Altuve will come in to pitch at some point, right?
This series has everything - comebacks, homers, 2 out hitting, occasional pitching &amp; defense, racism. If the mascot gets hit, perfection.
@ConservativeLA Kershaw threw cookies up there that inning. lots of them. no crispness at all.
@billpostradio He shouldn't. He is. Life ain't fair or right.
@JolloScott but he's consistent. Kershaw is not taking advantage of it. The pitch to Gurriel was middle of the plate.
kershaw is throwing meatballs now. even that flyout to 2nd was middle up. he's acting like he's out of gas, and he's only at 60 pitches.
Great call by that 2nd base ump. doesn't get much closer than that. Correa was safe, but a very quick tag by culberson.
That last pitch hung middle of the plate. if that's just off the plate in, it's 1) unhittable, and 2) called a strike by this ump.
As good as Kershaw is, amazing to me he's not taking a page out of the calls Keuchel was getting and throwing everything 2 inches inside.
@Texcessories for a lot of stuff, that's fair. What he did is a tad more than giving another player a hotfoot.
@Texcessories MLB is on the right side of the issue by not sweeping it under the rug due to it being World Series, Gurriel sits one game, and life goes on
@Texcessories He appeals, which labor union can do, apologizes, rest of suspension is then served next season after appeal hearing. Astros show class...
@Texcessories Here's how it should have been. Astros bench him for the following game to show they won't tolerate racism. MLB suspends 2 game...
@Texcessories i'm fine with 5. i would have been fine with 2. I just think it's bad, bad messaging to say it was bad enough to suspend, but not now.
@Texcessories That's up to MLB to dish out penalty. My guess is it was either 2 games served now or 5 games delayed to next season, and they chose that.
@michaelbeck @CG_Cynic Make no mistake. If Gurriel ran against Hillary Clinton, I'd vote for him...right after he served his suspension.
@Eddie010170 @BobsFunGirl I just did.
@Texcessories So mocking Asians for the extra fold of skin around their eyes, that's how we defeat political correctness? Why did Gurriel apologize then?
@Eddie010170 @BobsFunGirl I was unaware I called you a hillbilly or a redneck. My family moved to California from Arkansas. So who is 'you people'?
@michaelbeck @CG_Cynic @ThomasBoswellWP The base voted for him in the primary. I didn't. Analogy doesn't work, GOP vs. Astros management. GOP wasn't paying Trump's candidate salary
@Eddie010170 @BobsFunGirl Okay, so racism is no biggie now. Got it. Let me know how that works out in the long run for you.
@CG_Cynic wouldn't that be something?
@michaelbeck @CG_Cynic @ThomasBoswellWP indeed. this is setting up to be a game 7 finish. unless something bizarre happens, kershaw wins tonight, verlander wins tuesday.
@Eddie010170 @BobsFunGirl I'm not pulling for the Dodgers here. Whataboutism won't work on me. They're racist, too, is a pretty weak argument.
@michaelbeck @CG_Cynic @ThomasBoswellWP i'm not saying you're wrong. it was wrong of what he did. i really thought it was crap like that that would cost him the nomination.
@talkradio200 Sloppy. Should be 1 - zip. Spotting 2 extra runs for Kershaw? Not how you draw up a winning game plan.
If there is baseball karma, you saw it. that 3rd run for the Dodgers is courtesy of Gurriel, who should be serving his suspension right now.
The very last thing you want to do if you're Houston is give Kershaw a two run lead before he even toes the rubber.
That was an exceptional slider to strike out Bellinger. Pitch count, though...
@CG_Cynic @michaelbeck @ThomasBoswellWP Me, too. I just won't ignore justifying the Gurriel affair. All involved missed the mark. On with the show.
Keuchel got the strikeout of Seager, but that sinker didn't end up where he wanted it. That was a very hittable pitch, and he knows it.
@michaelbeck @ThomasBoswellWP Never did. I'm specifically soured on Astros management and cowardly MLB front office. That's all.
@michaelbeck @ThomasBoswellWP Make no mistake, I'd still rather have the Astros beat the Dodgers, but my heart's not in it now. Astros management was spineless here.
@ConservativeLA Brownnoser.
@ConservativeLA A fine word, sheesh.
@michaelbeck @ThomasBoswellWP I'm not outraged. I'm disappointed. Racism is bad, but the penalty is not worth assessing because the World Series is too important? Really?
@ConservativeLA He might as well have had a snow plow tied to his hood and said he was just preparing for bad weather moving in. Sheesh.
@michaelbeck @hughhewitt The astros at the bare minimum should have benched him for today, regardless of what MLB did. That would show they don't tolerate racism.
@michaelbeck @hughhewitt Apology is fine. Suspension is fine. Delaying it to next season because World Series games more important than racism is really bad.
5 games is appropriate suspension for Gurriel after racist gesture last night. Delaying it to next season is all kinds of wrong.
@cjboxauthor It wasn't Hugh Hefner's son, was it?
@CWR4 Two players got 2 games each this season for homophobic slurs. I get what you're saying from a baseball purist perspective. It's still 2017.
@CWR4 Um, MLB gets to decide. Like they have ever since Kennesaw Mountain Landis, like it or not. And you're wrong about the max penalty.
@LastCupKidd @BillPlaschke absolutely, I would. Without a question. I'm an Angels fan. I have no dog in this fight. I'm not saying banned for life. But yes, suspended.
@CWR4 On the field, I completely agree. Ignoring the PR/business side of this, however, is where you're missing it. MLB can't look other way.
@BillPlaschke The 'Stros should bench him before MLB even has to get involved, if they had any class/awareness of how bad this PR could be for them.
@CWR4 The question in 2017 is how much racism do we tolerate? I was under the impression we don't anymore.
@CWR4 I'm not naive. this isn't the 1st time in MLB  history there may have been racial gestures/statements. Jackie Robinson says hold my beer.
@CWR4 If a white player would have racially gestured to a black pitcher, still no big deal? Just baseball?
@CWR4 He did. Problem is he's an adult who did it on camera globally. And it's racist. It should not be minimized.
@CWR4 Umps know full well what's going on. If there's a pitch behind his ear tomorrow, that pitcher will be ejected. They won't let this escalate.
@CWR4 I'd counter by saying if that's so, then how one comports themselves in October is more important than in June.
@CWR4 If Gurriel gets thrown at tomorrow, that's old school baseball. it would be up to umps on field, and later MLB, to eject based on intent.
@CWR4 We decided to suspend player and coach for next game, which was tourney game. Did not affect outcome, yet that message did impact behavior.
@CWR4 I sat on discipline committee in local little league. Unsportsmanlike conduct during post-season tourney. We wrestled with this question.
@CWR4 That's a bad message to send. Racism is bad, but we will wait to show you how much because these games are super important?
@CWR4 Disagree. Regular season? 100% chance he's suspended. I'm afraid only reason it's iffy now is because it's WS.
@stephenkruiser There certainly is that, too. Baseball always kinda policed itself on the field. This still was pretty bad. MLB can't look the other way.
Yes, MLB should take action. What also should be said is Houston Astros should discipline Gurriel first before MLB steps in to send message.
The World Series is indeed a grand stage. It is still a baseball game. If any employee racially taunted anyone else, there'd be action.
Congrats to 'Stros for Game 3. I hope MLB in determining whether to suspend Gurriel for racist gesture, does not defer due to World Series.
@CG_Cynic @ConservativeLA @talkradio200 @tamij @CCC6 @servative @hughhewitt @michaelbeck @photog357 @texicalirose it's a great story that's based on a true story in 2010, but was embellished a bit.
@BrigetteToole @UrbanAchievr Yes, it's become partisan. She also was deemed to be less than credible, or Joe Biden as committee chair would have scuttled the nomination.
@glashoppah @KurtSchlichter You're correct. they all should have their day in court. You'll forgive me, though, if I never have Weinstein/Clinton et al babysit for me.
@BrigetteToole @UrbanAchievr Because Hill took and failed a polygraph test, among other reasons.
@glashoppah @KurtSchlichter Sorry, but Bill Clinton, Harvey Weinstein et al don't act very innocent to me.
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr That's where we disagree. You think Clinton is as disreputable now as Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, et al? He's still a rock star w/lefties.
@pmramani @KurtSchlichter @realDonaldTrump So long as you're willing to clean them all out, i'm with you.
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr Statute of limitations does affect impeachment in that the "crimes and misdemeanors" he/she is accused of is supposed to be while in office.
@pmramani @KurtSchlichter @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Now you're talking. If Mueller concludes there's wrongdoing, regardless of who did it, we should go after them. I'm with you.
@pmramani @KurtSchlichter @realDonaldTrump Really? Senate Intel, House Intel, they're looking the other way, when info they collected help lead to special counsel? Curious.
@pmramani @KurtSchlichter @realDonaldTrump And so long as there are worse crimes out there in your book, Bill Clinton's alleged rape gets a pass? Is that your position?
@pmramani @KurtSchlichter @realDonaldTrump As for crimes, nothing's been proven that i'm aware. We have an investigation underway to look into that with Mr. Mueller, no?
@pmramani @KurtSchlichter @realDonaldTrump Nonsense. Hugh and I both called for Trump to step down after the Access Hollywood tape.
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr I know lots of lawyers. I take your point, but again, that's not what Starr's mandate was, to just mudsling and see what stuck.
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr Again, simple answer is all that's necessary. I don't think you understand what statute of limitations means legally.
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr Good. You've already conceded that you believe Bill Clinton raped Broaddrick. Do you believe he acted as reported in office?
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr no, that's not what his charge was. The show I produced in 1995 interviewed him directly. He was charged w/prosecutable criminal wrongdoing.
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr So you believe her. You believe Bill Clinton raped her. I'm glad to hear a lefty admit that. Onward.
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr that wasn't his charge. his charge was to find criminal wrongdoing. If statute of limitations runs out, can't be a criminal charge.
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr So honestly, let's put politics aside for a sec and have a little thought experiment. Let's see if you can do this. Did OJ kill Nicole/Ron?
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr If Starr didn't believe her, as you falsely claim, he wouldn't have included her testimony even as periphery, which is was.
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr Again, you need to reread what you sent. Statute of limitation had run out, and could not prove forensically. That's what inconclusive means
@bobaloo_1 That's how it works. It's not my dog, no one saw him bite you, besides, you kicked him first.
@thomasa56 @KurtSchlichter 100%
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr Right, and that was an offensive thing to say. There were settlements of serious charges.
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr If this woman has proof, the case should go forward. Allred has very little credibility outside of the hyper-left.
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr I was unaware of that. I generally view Gloria Allred as having a long track record of trumped up political hit job lawsuits.
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr The fact he allowed Republicans to hear allegations means there was some believability there. He had no legal grounds with which to proceed.
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr No, that's not what that is. inconclusive doesn't mean he didn't believe her. He said it was past statute of limitations.
@beasleyrb Of course they are. All I'm saying is Bill Clinton wasn't exactly Bill Cosby'd, was he? He's still beloved by the left. He should be reviled
@DrMarkStano @KurtSchlichter I get what you're saying. If you read the allegations being made of Mark Halperin, it's a little more than hugging.
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr I do, too. Every accuser of Trump I've seen prior to election, was adjudicated/settled. I've heard of no current accusation.
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr The Starr report was about the Lewinsky affair and the attempt to lie about it to cover it up. It wasn't about Broaddrick.
@arleigh And he was impeached for obstruction of justice and perjury, not for sexual misconduct. Again, this is not hard to look up if you don't know
@arleigh Yes, he was. And the left, with help from MSM, minimized it by calling it a partisan attack. Democrats acquitted him in the Senate.
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr I can do this all day. You're wrong. You're partisan. So am I. I am also able to call out my side when they do wrong, and have so.
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr And after they reported on it, the righteous indignation that immediately followed on said newscasts, like they do for Trump on everything?
@SewertownNews @cpcurtiss68 @UrbanAchievr I'm sure you can find me loads of YouTube newscasts of ABC/CBS/NBC evening news reporting the use of Ms. Lewinsky's ladyparts as a humidor?
@Seeitcanbeblank @cpcurtiss68 @SewertownNews @UrbanAchievr I can do lots, including not having to resort to profanity. The liar here was Clinton, was it not? I did not have sexual relations...
@Seeitcanbeblank @cpcurtiss68 @SewertownNews @UrbanAchievr But you keep being you. Clinton is above the law. Get all the others,
@Seeitcanbeblank @cpcurtiss68 @SewertownNews @UrbanAchievr He faced no walk of shame for Paula Jones. She was deemed to be trailer park trash. Remember what Carville said about her, moron? drag $100?
But if one brings up Bill Clinton as a sexual predator, the left will still defend him to the death by any means possible. 2/2.
It's truly amazing to me to see how we've entered a climate where male sexual predators are not welcomes anymore, a fine development... 1/2
@Seeitcanbeblank @cpcurtiss68 @SewertownNews @UrbanAchievr Psst. I was talking about Kathleen Willey and Juanita Broaddrick. They both allege rape. Paula Jones was about harrassment. Try to keep up.
@BrigetteToole @UrbanAchievr oh, he's mentioned. It was concluded that the allegations by Anita Hill were not believed. Nor has any Thomas clerk ever anything negative.
@thatbillokeefe You keep telling women how much you care about them, that you have their back, as long as you can make it about Trump hatred.
@cpcurtiss68 @SewertownNews @UrbanAchievr Nonsense. His "walk of shame" was about Monica Lewinsky only. The sordid details were kept off MSM. His rape allegations never were "outed"
@thatbillokeefe @EdMorrissey But I'm sure you're welcomed around feminist circles for your staunch defense of women's rights.
@thatbillokeefe @EdMorrissey And instead of addressing the charge, the sexual assault and alleged rape by Bill Clinton of at least two women, you attack the messenger.
@thatbillokeefe @EdMorrissey i've tried to get their story told for about 20 years. You have no earthly idea what you are talking about. Your Trump hatred consumes you.
@thatbillokeefe @EdMorrissey I don't care about what, exactly, sexual abuse of women? You know me that well, do you? If so, you wouldn't make an ass of yourself on this.
@thatbillokeefe @EdMorrissey your point being? I get you hate Trump. Trump hatred excuses Bill Clinton alleged rape and Hillary knowledge/enabling? Are you that deluded?
Whoever the creep may be, I'm all for their outing and public walk of shame. It's maddening to me that Bill Clinton is still set aside.
You think Juanita Broaddrick/Kathleen Willey wonder when their stories of Bill Clinton's unwanted sexual advances will finally be heard?
@cohasset_kid someone's gotta do it.
AG Sessions: Ongoing matters there (Consumer Finance Protection Bureau), but I agree it's unconstitutional.
AG Sessions: I haven't decided, but I might be recused from Fusion. No comment on whether I'm recused on Uranium One.
@3NGLI2H I rise to revise and extend my previous remarks... :-)
@CCC6 Almost.
Best of 5 now with 'Stros having 3 at home. What an epic game.
Someone bring smelling salts to both @ConservativeLA and @michaelbeck - STAT!
What's great about this game is exciting as hell, and no one is missing the Red Sox or Yankees.
RT @CCC6: @Radioblogger Your head is better than I thought. I apologize, Sir.
Ok, regardless of the final outcome, we've entered into All-timer status with this game.
If you want to know what the tips are in baseball, that last pitch by Giles was it.
Walk off winning run at the plate. Vin Scully isn't too far from the broadcast booth. Just sayin'. #AnyoneSeenGibson?
Who the hell is Logan Forsythe? I bet he has to show ID to get into his own clubhouse.
@BrianGMattson He's done two inning saves all year.
Okay, so this game is turning out to be a helluva game. Can the Dodgers come back and make this an all-timer?
@talkradio200 @CG_Cynic @ConservativeLA @michaelbeck I do love baseball. Still want the 'Stros to pull the Series out. My head still says the Dodgers will, though.
@BrianGMattson Yup. It aged like the Dodgers pen did in 5 innings.
@CG_Cynic @ConservativeLA @michaelbeck I said if the Dodgers got to verlander. They did. Dodgers pen faltered tonight. New series.
Did not expect the vaunted Dodgers pen to give up 4 in Game 2. 'Stros showing heart.
Mighty Mouse strikes again. Amazing talent, Altuve shows. His heart is bigger than his body.
Regardless of Dave Roberts' heroic efforts to rein in Yasiel Puig, you can't take the Serrano out of him. #WhereIsMyGlove
@CCC6 I don't think I wish to peruse your secret stash of pictures, sir.
@CCC6 Difference between Hillary and the Dodgers is they look better with facial hair, and they went to PA and WI down the stretch.
That was the Series, I'm afraid. Houston will win a game back home, but Dodgers in five. Too many weapons all firing at the right time.
@tarzanajoe Jet lag.
Surprised with their bullpen, Dave Roberts hasn't gotten someone up, yet.
There has never been a broadcaster of anything that can simultaneously be a ham and self-deprecatingly winsome better than Vin Scully.
@michaelbeck @ConservativeLA Me, too. Not taking anything away from Fernando, but Koufax would have been epic. Nevertheless, that was cool to watch.
Must win for the 'Stros tonight. Hard to imagine a scenario for Houston winning it all if L.A. gets to Verlander in Game 2.
@JonahNRO 100% agree. no question. Alabama chose differently. Alas. Quantity is more important than quality until you get north of 60 in the Senate.
@JonahNRO The reality is that his endorsement only helps Moore raise some money, which is needed, because that race is way closer than it should be.
@JonahNRO I think that's a fair point. I don't think political endorsements across the board matter anywhere near as much as they used to.
@JonahNRO And losing another seat to a Democrat doesn't exactly make the GOP Senate work better. I want stuff done.
@JonahNRO Heh. I treat it like preseason football rosters. Put a jersey on all. After a term, whittle it down to what you need, a functional majority.
@JonahNRO I understand that. I'm a numbers guy. Give me 75 Republicans in the Senate, and then we can whittle down the crazies and have 60 pass stuff.
@JonahNRO If Luther Strange had won, Cruz would have endorsed him. Answer to bad speech is more speech. Answer to bad republicans is more republicans.

@K_Bob @madsenc maybe. I think he's pretty genuinely disillusioned, though.
@madsenc That said, of course there's the political reality that he realized he was doomed in the primary,  wanted to go out w/a bang, not a whimper.
@madsenc i won't speak ill of Flake here. I think a line crossed in his head, and he's following through. Trump/Bannon made an enemy they didn't need

@johnondrasik @Angels Lucky bastard. I watched, and even though I despised the Dodgers, Vinny made me like them again...temporarily.
@gtb It was highlight reel worthy. Best moment of Turner's young career. Probably guarantees him a role in the next Pirates reboot movie.
@ChadTheElder That's what I mean. The epic nature of that moment in 1988 was movie quality. And not one produced by Harvey weinstein.
TBS compares Josh Turner walk-off to Kirk Gibson in 1988. Not even close. Drama around Gibson exponentially more epic. Plus, Vinny retired.
I'm sure glad the @Angels had John Lackey in 2002 before he turned into a goat.

I get it that fans like seeing wrecks at NASCAR races, but this is just boring. If I wanted to watch a demolition derby, I'd turn on ESPN 8.
At some point, NASCAR teams will make the calculation the points aren't worth the $ they lose in a wrecked car guaranteed at talladega.
NASCAR has to fix this. Either let them run and make cars handle worse, or restrict speed and tighten up handling in packs. Can't have both.
If NASCAR works just a bit more to make cars handle worse, we may finally have a restrictor plate race where no one finishes.

@youreyeondenver @hughhewitt @Indians Herb Score was the voice of the Indians for about 40 years.
@youreyeondenver @hughhewitt @Indians '95 pennant call, not '16. herb score, not tom hamilton. other than that, it's right on the money.
@JeffQuinton @hughhewitt @Indians it helps to tick him off. '95 ALCS game Indians won the AL pennant, call by Herb Score. Nothing else will do.
@GA2Texas @hughhewitt @Indians we know. that's not what he's looking for. He's looking for Herb Score calling the Indians winning the '95 pennant - AL championship.
@youreyeondenver @hughhewitt @Indians yes, but that would not be herb score, would it? the unicorn remains at large.
@bicyclepackman Herb Score's mythical call is like Obamacare reform. We're told it's out there, but no matter how hard you try, can't prove it exists.
@bicyclepackman don't have to convince me. I know he didn't say it. If that call is as iconic as Hugh claims it is, it would be somewhere.
@bicyclepackman i've been on that goose chase for a decade. it simply does not exist.
@JeffQuinton @hughhewitt @Indians nope. it's not the unicorn hugh is looking for that doesn't exist. He swears Herb Score said Indians win the pennant in '95. I say he didn't

@TFDark @stephenkruiser last time I checked, I didn't cite any of those three, nor did they wear cops are pigs socks and protested the National Anthem. Keep trying.
@TFDark @stephenkruiser I saw his actions. I know he doesn't think much.
@TFDark @stephenkruiser i'll make a larger bet you have absolutely no idea of anything about me or how i spend my time.
@TFDark @stephenkruiser what utter nonsense. facts are stubborn things. more police are killed annually by black suspects than unarmed black suspects killed by cops
@TFDark @stephenkruiser I hate no one. Except for Hillary. She's pretty loathsome. Besides her, no hate. Just not excusing his actions, nor those who join with him.
@AubreyHolloman yes, we should. see previous tweet.
@TFDark @stephenkruiser 1st time he took a knee protesting the anthem, he wore cops are pigs socks. You'll forgive me if his statement now has 0 credibility with me
OJ is headed to Naples, Florida, where he wants 2 things - steak, iPhone. Suppose someone can cut that steak for him? Asking for a friend.
@ConservativeLA I'm really happy it came back up in time. Stupid, stupid Cox cable.
@AubreyHolloman good luck with that. the reason NFL is partially in a PR nightmare is colin kaepernick took a knee to draw attention to cops are pigs sox.
@CoxHelp Instead of tech support saying it'll be back in 4 hrs, how about letting us know what you're doing to keep outages like this from occurring?
@CoxComm how about we celebrate a work ethic instead and restore service in SoCal, where you've had major outages about half a dozen times this year?
@TFDark @stephenkruiser straw man argument. are you wearing socks that say priests are pedophiles? if so, you're generalizing. if not, no.
@AubreyHolloman Donald Trump threw gas on the fire. No doubt. But you do no good by refusing to admit what started this all - Cops are pigs socks.
@AubreyHolloman If you are taking a knee in symbolic gesture with Kaepernick, you are signaling you share his sentiments behind his actions.
@TFDark @stephenkruiser he wore cops are pigs socks when he first took the knee. he never differentiated. he generalized. You may agree with him. Majority don't.
@alibertarian @hughhewitt I'd be more surprised if he did comment on it, being he's not on the air until Monday morning.
We are pleased to inform you, @CoxComm continued, that service will be returned in four hours. So that's that for the Aftershow. Regrets.
So I'm prepping for the Aftershow with @Lileks, and Internet just crashed. Called @CoxComm, our damnable ISP. Yes, you're in an outage area.
@AubreyHolloman there wasn't any nuance to colin kapernick's cops are pigs socks. that's what the protests are about.
@TFDark @stephenkruiser colin kaepernick didn't kneel to say some cops are pigs. he generalized. those who take a knee adopt that. nice try.

@michaelbeck @hughhewitt That does not mean a majority. It means an instant reaction force of Trump supporters. It's anecdotal, not conclusive.
@michaelbeck @hughhewitt trump will have a floor of support of around 30% no matter what. If one dares to question the President in a public venue, instant wrath.

@dirtseller Frank, you're wrong. Deep down, I think you know you're wrong. At least I sincerely hope you do.
@michaelbeck @hughhewitt Parade of the red hats.
You know Trump had a bad day yesterday when @SRuhle is reasonable. 😏
@dirtseller don't start with me, Frank. Yes, he gave the neo-Nazis more than they could have dreamed of yesterday.
@morgdad @EdMorrissey GOP has their problems, to be sure. And they did cause damage with health care debacle. Yesterday was order of magnitude worse.
@Mattfobrien Actually, your example makes my point. You don't know what you don't know. That means the future.
@Mattfobrien ...it's wise, at least from my perspective, to wait until this term is over before final judgment.
@Mattfobrien went through all sorts of treatments - both conventional and alternative. I don't know my own outcome any more than docs did. that's why...

@OhioCoastie well, to be fair, that will be on the plus side of the ledger when the numbers are added up.
@Mattfobrien movie critics, even though they are pretty sure they'll hate the movie, still make it to the end before writing their screed, don't they?
@Mattfobrien Yesterday, in my opinion, was his worst day thus far. Jury's still out. 3 1/2 years to go before you can judge fairly his presidency.
As the de facto head of the Republican Party, he's not just damaging his own brand, but the GOP brand much more than health care debacle did
And to all of you loyalists to the President who are cheering the moral equivalence employed yesterday, you're underestimating the damage.
Again, when Trump does something good, like getting NK to blink, I cheer. When he gives quarter to neo-Nazis, deal me out. That was horrible
So after spending the first half of the show on the President's memorable presser yesterday, Trump loyalists are telling us how wrong we are

@ConservativeLA it is a fine piece.
@ConservativeLA It's clearly been a problem for years, and progressively getting worse. Just merely offering the trigger point for media coverage.
@ConservativeLA at least on our behalf, the most recent "election" making him dictator.
@conservpv @PolitiBunny @BrentBozell I would agree with that assessment, but it's irrelevant to which camp is worse in their analysis of Trump as president.
@conservpv @PolitiBunny @BrentBozell i'm not taking sides on who's worse - red hats or nevertrumpers. Trump is a complicated case. there is no 100% truth from either camp.
@conservpv @PolitiBunny @BrentBozell I reject both red hats who can find no fault with Trump as well as nevertrumpers who can't praise good.
@conservpv @PolitiBunny @BrentBozell Congress has said it's dead. The President still called for it. i thought we were discussing the President's conservative bonafides?
@conservpv @PolitiBunny @BrentBozell He's said lots of conservative things that I have praised. Time will tell if he follows through on the words with actions.
@conservpv @PolitiBunny @BrentBozell border tax, tariffs, trade wars aren't the most conservative thing in the world. Trump is a mixed bag. he's not all good, not all bad.
@conservpv @PolitiBunny @BrentBozell I saw Bozell's comments. I do not agree with them at all. Flake is no more a RINO than Ted Cruz is.
@PolitiBunny @conservpv I would concur. I'm merely trying to keep the comparables to the Senate, since Flake is now apparently a RINO. He's just not.
@conservpv @PolitiBunny how is he not serving his constituents? Again, what exactly is your charge against him, other than he's not pro-Trump?
@beasleyrb The aliens don't know beef very well. That's why they keep coming here to attack. They want our angus.
@conservpv @PolitiBunny Is being RINO-y being steadfastly pro-life? voting at every possible turn to repeal/replace obamacare? Susan Collins is a RINO.
@conservpv @PolitiBunny Again, what is a true RINO? someone who is as pro-2nd amendment as humanly possible? someone that voted to put Neil Gorsuch on the bench?
@conservpv @PolitiBunny Well, to say it's running like a well-oiled machine wouldn't be the truth, would it?
@conservpv @PolitiBunny Now that's a valid complaint. Flake is clearly running at least partially against Trump. But please let facts be facts. Don't make crap up.
@telepastor And don't even get me started with Major League Baseball's annual midsummer night's classic, the All-Pentagram Game.

8) I have no earthly idea of the moral worldview of Outback leadership. I also know that Satan is very real. This controversy? Wholly stupid
7) The aliens secretly are running Outback. Where's Steven Spielberg when we need him? You laugh, but it's as ludicrous as the Satanic bit.
6) Wait a minute. I know what these are. They're not pentagrams. They're not even circles. They're crop circles.
5) How could a company try to offer a product that's spaced out as to not compete with each other, yet still be nearby to wherever you are?
4) Can you imagine the unmitigated gall of Outback master planning? To put up Outbacks in a ring around a city's suburb? The nerve!
3) continue drawing your arc from the 2nd point to the 3rd, and so on, until you get back to your start at point 1. You now have...a circle.
2) Take any of the 'pentagram' clusters in any one city suburb. start at one point on the circle, and draw an arc clockwise to next point.
1) First of all, I don't think Outback is planning any demonic bloomin' onion ceremonies anytime soon. In fact, this issue is patently silly

@BioTurboNick @DavidMDrucker what, conference committee? of course, that's how it works. 2 similar but different bills between houses get reconciled in conference comm.
@DavidMDrucker conference committee would have been ultimately the "regular order" hearing process, if it had gotten that far. skinny wouldn't have been it

What tonight wrought? Flash forward to '21. President Kamala Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Maj. Ldr. Schumer. Single payer passes. Game over.
Just to clarify, Senate GOP, you basically settled for Obamacare staying as is, Medicaid untouched, unreformed and unsustainable. Nice job.
Lastly, for the talk of some conservatives the skinny bill wouldn't have done anything, why is the left celebrating they dodged a bullet?
Bottom line is this. 1. According to Senate GOP, Obamacare is better than their three best alternatives. 2. You need 70 GOP to get anything.
The irony of McCain's decisive no vote is it prevented a bipartisan conference committee final version he sought. Blame game frenzy ensues.

@alibertarian @hughhewitt because the 2nd rate ones are still sleeping.
@mckaycoppins negative. scaramucci in same interview, audio now available at https://t.co/EniAXFlCNU, said he advised POTUS not to blow Mueller out.
@BrianJMelton @Tacia nice try. i don't fit the trump defender profile. i hit him when he does bad stuff. i credit him w/ good stuff. you should try that sometime

@TheRickWilson gotta say, don't much like it. at all. just reporting what just happened. don't take pleasure in this at all.
@Tacia the funny part? he's still more popular today than Hillary is today. Chew on that.

@CillizzaCNN anyone else in WH comms say something close to this before now? if so, i haven't heard it. but point taken.
@allahpundit Hugh's question back was, "So why doesn't Trump just fire him, because this can't continue?" Scaramucci's response? "Trump has a style"
@MichaelRWarren first time the comms team added weight to the bus that Trump is backing and re-running over Sessions with, right?
Anthony Scaramucci just told Hugh Hewitt that it's pretty apparent that Trump wants Sessions gone.
@StevenJDuffield @jimgeraghty it's not like the extra time on the senate floor kept them from developing a plan for health care reform early on.
@DavidMDrucker that's what is so disturbing. if they can't get this right, how will they ever deal with SS/Medicare reforms? We're doomed.
@DavidMDrucker true enough. total repeal rand paul calls for was always a pipe dream. total recall was always subject to 60 vote cloture.
RT @guypbenson: 73% voluntarily. That's not "losing." Vast majority of remaining # derived from already-obsolete CBO baseline: https://t.co…
@DavidMDrucker total repeal was never possible under reconciliation. the 2015 "clean repeal" passed in 2015 was under reconciliation. wasn't total repeal.
@guypbenson I think if Sessions waits to get fired instead of quitting, he qualifies for unemployment benefits, right?
@jpodhoretz they're maybe voting to begin talking about a shell of a bill that will be amended for weeks before deciding to call for final vote.
@chrislhayes it's either repeal/replace, or it's repeal that passed in 2015. everyone has seen both bills. this is only vote to move onto bill, not final

@MaxxBot You're not going to get what you want, you know. what you're laying groundwork for is single payer when Dems take over in 2020.
@MaxxBot want to see abysmal approval? wait until next year's rates hit and people hit the roof.
@MaxxBot If the GOP can't even put their own motion on the floor for debate, kinda hard to blame Democrats because it's just too hard.
@MaxxBot You're dreaming if you think Dems will own this in 2018 after being out of power for two years. People elected GOP/Trump to kill/fix this.
My suspicion is if Chuck Schumer gets into power as majority leader, they'll scrap the filibuster anyway to get what they want.
Why? Because they all know they're going to be in the minority one day, and when they are, the Dems will pound through stuff through.
The same GOP sens who want clean repeal, &amp; those who supported repeal/replace attempt just scrapped, are united to protect the filibuster.
I would heartily recommend and relish the day when the filibuster went back to what the filibuster's role originally was. Only one problem.
Ending the legislative filibuster would be a marvelous bookend to ending the judicial filibuster to get Neil Gorsuch on the Court.
There is only one way the clean repeal will pass this year, &amp; that's if the GOP use the nuclear option to end the legislative filibuster.
But make no mistake. when people scream about '18 premiums/deductibles, Sens Lee, Paul, Johnson, Collins all opted for Obamacare.
Hopefully, when the premiums skyrocket, as they will, again, and coverage withers with the new enrollment period, GOP will act finally.
McConnell will then, most likely, send everyone home after the failure and let them get an earful from people who will be ticked off.
Total clean repeal is outside of reconciliation rules, so it takes 60 votes to unwind it. It won't happen. Then what, Sens Paul, Lee et al?
But even if all 52 vote for clean repeal, which is doubtful, you still need 8 democrats to go along with them. Name one. I dare you.
And that 52 assumes Lisa Murkowski, Rob Portman, Susan Collins and other senators from states that took Medicaid expansion $ vote for it.
Now that Trump is POTUS, there's only one hurdle between clean repeal and Trump signature - 60 votes to end filibuster/cloture. GOP has 52.
The reason Dems let GOP have their fun was because they knew Obama would veto it instantly, and there were not enough votes to override.
History lesson - In 2015, with GOP running both houses and Barack Obama as POTUS, clean repeal was passed and vetoed. Dems let GOP have fun.
...that passed in May, bring it to the floor with one amendment - straight up repeal that passed both houses in 2015. Will be a fun exercise
If Rand Paul, Mike Lee, bunches of GOP senators are hiding behind a straight repeal vote request, give it to them. Take the House bill...
1. As long as John McCain is sidelined &amp; senators like Lee &amp; Johnson are getting cold feet again, he's got the time to call the repeal bluff
While some may criticize Mitch McConnell for not getting health care reform done, what he did earlier this evening was tactical brilliance.

@endingwelfare @hughhewitt @djbrink @SalemMediaGrp @DennisPrager @MedvedSHOW @TalkStreamLive @radiotalkermike Elementary school. My parents were funny that way. They wanted me to get an education and not seem or sound illiterate.
@endingwelfare @hughhewitt @djbrink @SalemMediaGrp @DennisPrager @MedvedSHOW @TalkStreamLive @radiotalkermike Me? Know something you don't? Hardly. I've only done this for 22 years. I haven't been an amateur rapper/radio listener like you, though.
@endingwelfare @hughhewitt @djbrink @SalemMediaGrp @DennisPrager @MedvedSHOW @TalkStreamLive But to your larger point, which I'm becoming more convinced with each successive tweet that not even God knows what that is, no, it doesn't.
@endingwelfare @hughhewitt @djbrink @SalemMediaGrp @DennisPrager @MedvedSHOW @TalkStreamLive Technically, there's a comma after no, but I digress. You'd think a consumer of English-language radio would care about English language.
@endingwelfare @hughhewitt @djbrink @SalemMediaGrp @DennisPrager @MedvedSHOW @TalkStreamLive So they're the definitive radio trade ratings service? Who knew?
@endingwelfare @hughhewitt @djbrink @SalemMediaGrp @DennisPrager @MedvedSHOW I'm not defending anything. I'm basking in the glow emanating forth from the font of all radio wisdom who seems to have a complaint.
@endingwelfare @hughhewitt @djbrink @SalemMediaGrp @DennisPrager @MedvedSHOW So let me get this straight. You claim you know the radio game, &amp; Dennis Prager is prime time? You know prime time is AM or PM drive, right?
@endingwelfare @hughhewitt @djbrink @SalemMediaGrp I'll get back to you later after I have someone who is bilingual in whatever language you use to communicate and English translate for me.
@endingwelfare @hughhewitt @djbrink @SalemMediaGrp So what is it you're proving? Stock performance of a corporation is directly tied to 1 guest once a week on 1 show? How brilliantly astute.
@endingwelfare @hughhewitt @djbrink @SalemMediaGrp Oh, by the way, there was this economic crash in '08 that seemed to have affected a bunch of companies globally, not just us. Uptick since.
@endingwelfare @hughhewitt @djbrink @SalemMediaGrp Certainly. Specifically, your timeline. (And by the way, not to pick a nit, but English is usually capitalized.)
@endingwelfare @hughhewitt @djbrink @SalemMediaGrp Looks like a steady climb from 5 years ago. But with your English skills on full display, not surprising you can't read graphs, either.
Santa Ana PD was doing their best, but it wasn't just one street engaged in firework warfare. it sounded like half the city was doing it.
You could look down the length of 1 residential street and see hundreds of bottle rockets fired at neighbors across the street like RPG's.
I've lived near Santa Ana all my life. Never experienced anything approaching level of illegal fireworks tonight. Was like battle for Raqqa.

@cohasset_kid @hughhewitt Problem is that's a two move chess play, and we're still dealing with someone playing checkers with the media.
@cohasset_kid @hughhewitt part of me wanted to entertain the idea that the tweet was intentional diversion to take heat off of MSM pounding on health care.
@allahpundit Other than a straight repeal could never pass? nothing at all.
@Jessicajohn911 as i said, indefensible. full stop. I'm just laughing at the absurd overreact by MSM who glossed over the sordid details of Clinton.
@Jessicajohn911 you and me both. he was my pick among the primaries. still prefer his foreign policy worldview.
@Jessicajohn911 where is your evidence. has that ever been proven? or is that just accepted as gospel because people don't like him? Never seen it proven.
@Jessicajohn911 i'm sorry you or anyone ever has to go through that. words aren't impeachable. actions and lying under oath to grand jury are.
@Jessicajohn911 Never said it was okay. you do realize what exactly clinton did in the oval office, right? all of what he did? Tell me what Trump did again?
@Jessicajohn911 What trump wrote was unacceptable. what Clinton did was what lefties today are trying to attribute to Trump now.
@Mattfobrien correct. they're overplaying their hand. trump is a bully. he was elected in large part to be one. known quantity. still indefensible.
@Jessicajohn911 oh please, please tell me what trump tweeted and what clinton did is morally equivalent. please try and tell me that.
@Mattfobrien and yet msm is on their soap box about how beneath the dignity of the office Trump demonstrates, but not the same judgment at clinton.
@Jessicajohn911 there is no comparison between the two. trump's tweets are indefensible. clinton's behavior was subject to impeachment. lied to grand jury.
There is no defense to Trump's tweets yesterday. Full stop. MSM has zero credibility post-Clinton/Lewinsky to talk about dignity of office.
@ConservativeLA no aftershow today. We have power. Power is good. We have no internet. No Internet is bad. Trying to get from bad to good.

@michaelbeck @hughhewitt in general, i would agree. what we're saying is if we campaign on this for 7 years and fold the first time we have the chance, we're done.

@Rakman2000 @hugh simple and cute thing to say, but not possible with the current culture of the senate. you then claimed filibuster was unconstitutional.
@Rakman2000 @hugh no, you are conflating theory with reality. i told you blanket repeal isn't doable because of reconciliation rules. you said blow that up.
@michaelbeck @hughhewitt technically, he may have a point. if they let it burn and stew for a week or 2, pressure of inaction builds, forcing them to do something.
@Rakman2000 @hugh which section of article I says the filibuster is unconstitutional. you can spend all day. it ain't there. senate makes their own rules.
@Rakman2000 @hugh just for the sake of argument, try and know a smidge about what you're talking about, m'kay?
@Rakman2000 @hugh the senate makes their own rules regarding filibuster. there's nothing unconstitutional about it. it's extra-constitutional, but legal.
@Rakman2000 @hugh hugh and larry arnn have argued for this very point for months. we agree with this position. it's not gonna happen. senators won't do it.
@Rakman2000 @hugh So you're only willing to see the world as you want it to be, not as it is. dream on, sir. I'll hang out here in reality.
@Rakman2000 @hugh he's not the only one. you've have to replace about 45 of the 52 to get your legislative filibuster. please, dear Lord, face reality.
@Rakman2000 @hugh i can tell you all 48 dems and probably 45 GOP would vote against that, if it came up, which it won't. this is time for reality, not fantasy
@Rakman2000 @hugh tell me who's going to go along with dumping legislative filibuster. honestly, tell me which 50 will do that. i'm with you. it won't happen.
@Rakman2000 @hugh i know you're not dim, but you need to please look at the reality of it. total repeal takes 60 to beat cloture. you have 52 now.
@Rakman2000 @hugh total repeal cannot pass. please just this once, face reality. total repeal isn't doable under reconciliation, so it takes 60 votes.
Perhaps using the bully tweetpit on something more productive, like grinding recalcitrant senate Repubs to get AHCA passed might be prudent? https://t.co/NGevUZmdsx

Dear @SenatorCollins, @RandPaul, @SenDeanHeller, @tedcruz, @sencorygardner, if your'e for single payer, at least come out and say so.
It's not hard to understand, Senate GOP. If you don't move forward on AHCA bill, you will lose control, and single payer comes next.

@tdtrpnr Yes. Also means the fake outrage over crafting it in secret/lack of transparency/all night session by dems was just that - fake outrage.
@willcollier Heh.
It's almost as if she never cared what would be in it when she complained about secrecy, planned on bashing it w/ talking points regardless.
How does Elizabeth Warren know enough about a bill crafted behind closed doors until moments ago to read a prepared speech on Senate floor?
Wow. For such a secret health care plan that was just released, Nancy pelosi and Elizabeth Warren know enough to bash it. #fakeangst
@PaulBrittain3 @NumbersMuncher tom price's opponent in '16 spent $100k. Ossoff spent $30 million. ossoff got 9% more in vote. wise investment of resources?
@PaulBrittain3 @NumbersMuncher playing defense. of course. unlimited resources in a special election. won't be nearly that much in '18. too many other races.
6. Don't underestimate the impact of the white powder attack on Handel's neighborhood. That didn't play well in the district, either.
@PatrickRuffini don't think they would have if it hadn't been for trump. they honestly believed rest of country has soured on trump as much as they have.
@PaulBrittain3 @NumbersMuncher This was a one-off opportunity to throw the kitchen sink and $30 million to pick off a win. Story is effectiveness of GOP's ground game.
4. (cont'd) ...napping Trump voters in the last week. 5. Trump/GOP support isn't indestructible, but is still vastly underestimated by MSM.
3. (cont'd) ...meaning in the closing week, the energy was actually more on Handel's side, not Ossoff's. 4. Scalise attack may have woken...
3. for all the talk about the wave, the energy of the left, which is there to some degree, rain diminished Dem Election Day turnout more...
2. For all the grief Reince Priebus gets, GOP ground game disadvantage from 2008-2014 has been largely fixed. GOP's GOTV pretty strong now.
thoughts on tonight's special elections - 1. money spent on GA-06 in '17 will never be matched in '18. Ossoff won't raise anywhere near that
@PaulBrittain3 @NumbersMuncher what you don't get is that ossoff in 2018 won't have $30 million to spend, either. he was the only game in town in '17. won't be in '18.

@Bingelish @virtualbri the recess will be postponed or cancelled.
@Bingelish @virtualbri your ignorance and rehashing of left wing talking points is not only pathetic, but not work any more brain space. good luck.
@Bingelish @virtualbri i am a three-time cancer patient. i understand fully how healthcare works, snowflake. also know it's not government's job to care for me.
@virtualbri @Bingelish it is an open process. we will know every part of the bill when it hits the floor. learn senate procedure before spouting talking points.
@Bingelish @virtualbri nonsense. 13 have seen it, rest will see it once it's brought to the floor. again, learn how the senate works before tweeting. would help.
@Bingelish @virtualbri perhaps an understanding of how the senate procedure works before tweeting your ignorance might be in order?
@Bingelish @virtualbri when the bill is brought to the floor and amendments begin to be offered. there will be dozens of amendments. floor process will take weeks.
@Bingelish @virtualbri there are roles for the government. that ain't one of them.
@Bingelish @virtualbri state medicaid programs. it's never been the responsibility of the federal government to provide access to private health insurance.
@virtualbri but nice try.
@virtualbri it was true at the time, it's true now. gop is trying to get federal government gradually out of health care, not like dems taking it over.
@virtualbri @Bingelish what's secret about it? the bill will be presented on the floor, have dozens of amendments offered. contents of it will be known.
@SolidShepard or other times, you're a moron because you don't recognize gop is trying to get government out of health care business, unlike dems.
@TheTysonsCorner @virtualbri blinded by reality, i guess. dems took over health care. repubs trying to get government out, private sector/states back in. makes sense.
@Bingelish @virtualbri easily. GOP bill is trying to get government gradually out of health care business after Dems tried to take it over. it's not hard, actually
@virtualbri @Bingelish huh? the GOP is trying to craft a bill to specifically not have government in the middle of health care. my original tweet stands.
@K___Garner that's not what this is. it's not a takeover of 1/6th of the economy. it's an attempt to give it back after the dems took it over in '10.

@JuggerKnotty @hughhewitt missing the point entirely. it was justifiable how hard the media went at trump. not defending him. hillary's claim equally as delusional.
@michaelbeck @hughhewitt wasn't that audio just priceless? God love the Democrats, those old people hating nutlogs.
@Wiesnoski @hughhewitt Really? Trump himself is under investigation? here i thought it was mike flynn and others. Trump personally is under investigation?
@DelWilber it could be more fun, actually. i think kamala harris will be ruthless in the primary. she'll take out all comers. she's the one to beat.
@BrettMarks15 @hughhewitt really? you have proof that Trump directly guided the russians. Hey, the special counsel probably wants to talk to you.
@DelWilber A Dem candidate? there's going to be at least a dozen. Until kamala harris has all their legs broken with pipes.
@DelWilber look, i get it. Just astounds me that there's no intellectual curiosity to find out what her intel sources are and what else they're saying
@DelWilber neither of them said something that outrageous.
@gmpadis @hughhewitt you're ridiculous. enjoy leftyworld.
@gmpadis @hughhewitt no, Deputy Attorney General. He delegates responsibilities to the Bureau, but DAG makes the decisions right up until he named Mueller.
@gmpadis @hughhewitt they were intel gathering. the investigation decision making was always out of main justice. DAG was in charge, not Comey.
@gmpadis @hughhewitt so you don't understand the difference between prosecutorial decision making at main Justice, which is not FBI's job?
@gmpadis @hughhewitt FBI is the intel gathering arm. FBI doesn't make prosecutorial decisions. Main Justice does. You know that. Quit picking nits.
@DelWilber All i'm asking for is someone in MSM to dog her to explain herself with at least 1/10th the intensity of how MSM treats Trump.
@DelWilber when she claims her intel is leading her to believe he directly guided the russians? How's that less delusional than Trumpisms?
@gmpadis @hughhewitt you claim to not be a lefty, but you're giving the MSM a pass for showing a double standard. makes your claim hard to buy.
@gmpadis @hughhewitt firing the fbi director was irrelevant. he wasn't running the investigation. DOJ was. He was a head case, and Trump botched it on top of it.
@DelWilber so the media wouldn't have pressed Trump had hillary won? they wouldn't have pursued that at all? Don't see it playing out that way.
@gmpadis @hughhewitt Really? which special prosecutor or agent in the FBI has claimed that Trump was directly involved? Not even Comey has said that.
@DelWilber del, the DNC nominee just made the claim that Trump directly guided the russians here. Seriously? No follow up by anyone in MSM? Come on...
@gmpadis @hughhewitt and meanwhile, you're willing to give the MSM a pass for their hypocrisy and double standard. Stick with it, lefty.
@gmpadis @hughhewitt i'm willing to see the evidence as it's presented. there's been no subpoena, nothing indicating Trump directly involved.
@gmpadis @hughhewitt there is nothing whatsoever that suggests the investigation is targeting Trump personally for direct involvement with Putin. Zero.
@gmpadis @hughhewitt you're missing the point, probably intentionally. Trump's claim was savaged by MSM. Hillary's claim is taken as gospel, with no proof.
@gmpadis @hughhewitt No problem. You seem to generally accept premise of her claim, as do most of MSM. that's why no follow up questioning. just admit your bias.
@gmpadis @hughhewitt so you are saying the DC media is reacting to Hillary's claim with same intensity and ferocity as when Trump made his claim? You're nuts.
@JuggerKnotty @hughhewitt you're accepting the premise, therefore, no reason for media to pursue the claim. you're biased. that's fine, but at least admit it.
@JuggerKnotty @hughhewitt exactly what is the proof Trump directly guided the russians? what growing evidence is that again?
@gmpadis @hughhewitt she apparently has better intel than three committees and the department of justice. where's the media curiosity to probe how she knows this
@gmpadis @hughhewitt of course. that's why media went nuts over it. hillary just claimed trump directly guided the russians. not even maxine waters has said that
@gmpadis @hughhewitt or maybe the media has no desire to hound her to prove her claims like they did to trump 24/7 when he said that about Obama. #bias
Trump claimed Obama wiretapped him directly. media went understandably apoplectic. HRC claimed Trump guided Russians. Media? Crickets.

@ColbyBadhwar @hughhewitt don't encourage him.
This is why it's probably best to let others do the tweeting from now on. But glad there's a MD on call now at the WH - in case of stroke. https://t.co/zMxPowWGzA
@hughhewitt the answer should have been self-evident.
@ConservativeLA i just couldn't get excited about giving her the oxygen she so desperately craves.
@brianjacksonXP @DerekAndSusan they are awfully good, aren't they?
@guypbenson @JonahNRO @SandraSmithFox Ted Baxter would be so proud of your attire.
Good piece by @hughhewitt on why Republicans should be relieved Mueller will serve as special prosecutor https://t.co/MlrqM8uHHl
If Corey Lewandowski is already leaking the fact he's being approached to rejoin the Trump team, he's exactly the guy Trump doesn't need. https://t.co/YJeBTlYHm2
@IrishTea1 I plead guilty of whataboutism over the course of this election cycle/presidency. If this story is true, whataboutism doesn't cover it up.
@WhigsnTwigs @AlJimJuma @Mattfobrien the alt right has been on a mission since the campaigns started in 2016 of redefining who is and isn't a real republican. others have, too.
@IrishTea1 totally agree. DOJ was totally partisan during those 8 years, not believable on much of anything. don't lose sight of what is alleged here.
@IrishTea1 correct. difference here is we have story that trump allegedly tried to quash investigation directly. that's just not defensible, if true.
@IrishTea1 Um, where did he give that order to Holder? My impression is that Holder did that on his own, which is why the right went after Holder.
@AlJimJuma @WhigsnTwigs @Mattfobrien Graham is a republican. The problem with the alt-right is redefining what Republicans are/are not.
@AlJimJuma @Mattfobrien @WhigsnTwigs I was a Rubio supporter in the primaries. That said, totally irrelevant. If Trump did this, it's bad.
Like I said, other media hits at Trump this week damaging, but this NYT story feels like an order of magnitude worse. https://t.co/fzIiGldeAd
@Mattfobrien @AlJimJuma I was, and have said that a few times already.
@AlJimJuma @Mattfobrien McCabe testified to that, not Comey. i was mistaken, conflated the 2. Not sure Comey actually said that under oath that directly. McCabe did
@AlJimJuma @Mattfobrien bad enough? have no idea. that's a political question. But if Repubs can't/won't defend it if it bears out to be true, Trump's in trouble.
@AlJimJuma @Mattfobrien the memo should be subpoenaed if necessary, which Chaffetz said he'd do. if the memo says what's reported, testified to by comey, it's bad.
@Mattfobrien @AlJimJuma I'm not saying this rises, because it's unproven. But it's a story that's provable from a political standpoint. If so, impossible to defend.
@Mattfobrien @AlJimJuma Not 1 elected Republican came out today to speak on the NYT story. Not 1. It's not like they weren't asked. They know this is serious.
@Mattfobrien @AlJimJuma not isn't law stuff. political stuff. left has been clamoring for impeachment grounds for 3 months. This is 1st allegation that could fit.
@Mattfobrien @AlJimJuma If it gets critical mass and enough people believe it to be so, then it becomes a political problem for which there is only one remedy.
@klcmurphy @drawandstrike @KurtSchlichter @mikayladreyer @charlescwcooke @benshapiro @mckaycoppins he could be, if obstruction of justice is born out and politically achieves critical mass. lots of ifs have to be proven facts, though.
@mikayladreyer @drawandstrike @KurtSchlichter @charlescwcooke @benshapiro @mckaycoppins if i make a mistake, i own it. I think i clearly conflated comey with McCabe, who did testify that there was no interference by WH 2 wks ago
@AlJimJuma @Mattfobrien if he had a call from the president he believed to be crossing the line, documented it to leave a paper trail, nothing inappropriate there.
@mikayladreyer @drawandstrike @KurtSchlichter @charlescwcooke @benshapiro @mckaycoppins It may not, if i'm mistaking McCabe's testimony with what I thought I'd heard Comey said. If he said it under oath, i'll find it.
@AlJimJuma @Mattfobrien the proof in this instance is really simple. either the memo exists or not. it needs to be turned over to House/Senate committees.
@drawandstrike @KurtSchlichter @mikayladreyer @charlescwcooke @benshapiro @mckaycoppins I was under the impression Comey said something similar in open testimony. trying to find a citation.
@drawandstrike @KurtSchlichter @mikayladreyer @charlescwcooke @benshapiro @mckaycoppins i conflated McCabe's testimony with Comey's, i believe. McCabe testified last week no one interfered in the investigation from the WH.
@CindyCoops @uncommentari @drawandstrike @KurtSchlichter @mikayladreyer @charlescwcooke @benshapiro @mckaycoppins the problem is we don't know what we think we know. MSM doesn't know what they think they know. Trump doesn't know what he thinks he knows.
@susan_giannini Because a file memo written at the time of the call by Trump, again, if the memo exists and it did happen, it shows interference by Trump.
@drawandstrike @klcmurphy @KurtSchlichter @mikayladreyer @charlescwcooke @benshapiro @mckaycoppins Right. that's the perjury trap Comey faces. may be part of why he doesn't want to testify. But that circle needs to be squared.
@anthropocon @ConservativeLA You can, he said, in his best Loudon Wainwright, III 'Dead Skunk in the Middle of the Road' kinda way.
@uncommentari @drawandstrike @KurtSchlichter @mikayladreyer @charlescwcooke @benshapiro @mckaycoppins that's why i want to see the file memo. really hope Chaffetz and others subpoena it if necessary. really important to get to bottom of this.
@RealScottLamond @drawandstrike @KurtSchlichter @mikayladreyer @charlescwcooke @benshapiro @mckaycoppins I heard that on Rush today - the Comey Hillary/Huma defense - didn't intend to break laws. I rejected Comey on that then, do now.
@klcmurphy @drawandstrike @KurtSchlichter @mikayladreyer @charlescwcooke @benshapiro @mckaycoppins Firing changed nothing w/investigation either at DOJ or at FBI. McCabe still running the show. This is first time real interference alleged.
@klcmurphy @drawandstrike @KurtSchlichter @mikayladreyer @charlescwcooke @benshapiro @mckaycoppins totally disagree. firing was totally defensible, because he lost confidence. all that needed to be said.
@mikayladreyer @drawandstrike @KurtSchlichter @charlescwcooke @benshapiro @mckaycoppins He previously testified 2 weeks ago that Trump never interfered with investigation. File memo mentioned in NYT today disputes that.
@drawandstrike @KurtSchlichter @mikayladreyer @charlescwcooke @benshapiro @mckaycoppins but i still go the meta here. if the story is true, big if, to be sure, then the POTUS tried to interfere. That's not defensible.
@drawandstrike @KurtSchlichter @mikayladreyer @charlescwcooke @benshapiro @mckaycoppins He'd be set up for the classic "were you lying then or lying now." Yes, it's a trap for Comey, maybe why he declined to testify.
@drawandstrike @KurtSchlichter @mikayladreyer @charlescwcooke @benshapiro @mckaycoppins Well, if he testifies he was asked to shut down Flynn phase, defends his file memo, then that puts in question his previous testimony.
@CoachJamesHalm agreed. if file memo exists, best way to discredit it for Trump team is to cross Comey on previous testimony of no interference.
@madsenc have no idea. my suspicion is probably not. reason for the meeting on the plane was so that there'd be no record of the visit. no evidence.
@drawandstrike @KurtSchlichter @mikayladreyer @charlescwcooke @benshapiro @mckaycoppins i accept the discrepancy. If there is a file memo from the time of the call, this needs to be squared with previous testimony.
@madsenc me, too. lots of media mud at the wall this week is defensible for anyone except, apparently, the Trump PR team. This one smells worse.
@drawandstrike @KurtSchlichter @mikayladreyer @charlescwcooke @benshapiro @mckaycoppins very good question, one that should be explored under oath in committee testimony, compelled if necessary.
@drawandstrike @KurtSchlichter @mikayladreyer @charlescwcooke @benshapiro @mckaycoppins that's why he needs to come testify, compelled if necessary. this circle has to be squared.
@madsenc may not have been, but you're getting far afield in an attempt to defend the story of the day. If story is true, this is trouble for Trump.
@CoachJamesHalm file memo at the time of the alleged conversation goes a long way. Trump can deny it, but only way to prove denial is produce tape of call.
@Bagginator i've issued caveats on tweets at least a dozen times over last hour. but this allegation is easy enough to prove - produce memo and testify.
@madsenc i do not believe she issued one. Also don't believe Obama/WH coordinated that visit. no allegation made. doesn't change allegation here.
@CoachJamesHalm I'm not moving to penalty phase of trial here. don't misunderstanding me. I'm saying we should all be very concerned about this one.
@CoachJamesHalm Comey has colossal ego and isn't hero of the story, and i'm not making him one. but if Trump did what comey allegedly claims, very, very bad
@madsenc FBI was data collection. they don't do grand juries and issue subpoenas to witnesses. DOJ does.
@Bagginator that's why every tweet has caveat if true. if file memo exists, easy enough to prove true, though, which is why Jason Chaffetz should get it
@drawandstrike @KurtSchlichter @mikayladreyer @charlescwcooke @benshapiro @mckaycoppins I'm saying ignoring potential obstruction of justice because it's our guy doing it is not a wise strategy. dangerous, actually.
@Bagginator problem is they didn't run the investigation. DOJ runs the investigation. that's part of comey's problem. he thought he was in charge.
@CoachJamesHalm file memo at the time it happened, well before he was fired, along with his testimony, will be pretty compelling.
@jmotivator @EdMorrissey all that is true, &amp; i totally believe you. Doesn't change the underlying concern that Trump allegedly crossed a big line here, if story true
@Bagginator Where'd you get that? It was reported on 5/10/17 that the Justice Department issued supboenas to Flynn associates as part of investigation.
@ChasFlemming i'm all about presumption of innocence here. just saying allegation very serious, more so than others this week, &amp; it's one that's provable.
@ChasFlemming allegedly Comey was incensed enough at the time to document it in memo form and filed it. that should get subpoenaed and testified to.
@Bagginator If the story is true and the right downplays it, we're bigger hypocrites than the Democrats are. Again, if true, this is really, really bad.
@melanie_ward1 I have defended Trump plenty in the last week and a half. if this story is true, it's not defensible. it should alarm everyone.
@melanie_ward1 asked might be more of a velvet hammery definition of ordered, but it's indefensible, again w/caveat if NYT story is true.
@BruceLeGear absolutely correct. All i'm saying is the allegation is the most politically explosive one of them all so far in the MSM war against Trump.
@Kyle_Beckley @Mattfobrien if he was concerned enough about what was said to him directly by Trump enough to put in a file memo to document it, that &amp; testimony works.
@Kravmaganut That said, I haven't seen where Obama had to order Eric Holder to quash the investigation. I thought Holder quashed it on his own.
@Kravmaganut look, i think fast and furious was a major scandal that was wallpapered over by a MSM that was sycophantic.
@RightGlockMom @EdMorrissey not in sufficient enough detail for my liking, certainly not w/same moral judgment attached. that said, trump trying to quash is bad if true
@EdMorrissey This to me is the far more troubling story of them all this week. And it's technically provable to see if it happened or not.
If Barack Obama had ordered the FBI to close investigation into Lois Lerner's handiwork at IRS against GOP groups, we'd be losing it.
Seems easy enough to figure out who's telling the truth. subpoena memo, if necessary, and Comey to the Hill to talk.
If NYT story that Trump asked Comey to end Flynn investigation is true, that is not defensible. Trump told Lester Holt last wk he never did.
The firing of James Comey by Donald Trump is totally defensible. The messaging of it was bungled beyond all recognition. 1/2
RT @ConservativeLA: @Radioblogger I do, too. And I also know that he is trying to keep this shitshow from going off the rails. Laudable. Bu…
@JonahNRO Let's put it this way. If this is all Trump winning, I indeed am tiring of all the winning.
@JonahNRO I was careful in my first tweet that this is as of now. I totally expect more shoes to drop here.
@ConservativeLA Regardless, politically, this ensures Trump's awful last week continues for this week. And increases likelihood Trump blows out senior staff
@ConservativeLA This is acting bunker mentality here. All that said, I give immense benefit of doubt to McMaster.
@ConservativeLA Oh, the lack of questions and transparency speak volumes to me here. If this was nothing, full Chris Christie presser time.
@HotlineJosh Fair. McMaster denied the conclusions drawn in the Wapo story. Didn't deny the conversation occurred.
RT @EdMorrissey: @Radioblogger Having read McMaster's book and his clear warnings about not making falling into line a high priority, I ten…
@ReaganBattalion He denied the conclusions of the Wapo story. No questions indicate topic of conversation was probably sensitive info.
I would reflexively believe McMaster, but the fact he didn't take questions isn't very reassuring.
Either you believe McMaster, whose character integrity are unimpeachable, or you believe Wapo's mr. or ms. Official.
NSA McMaster: Waponstory is false. I was there. It didn't happen. No questions taken. This story still evolving, but as of now, 2 choices.
RT @JonahNRO: "McCain then went to his private office and threw a bust of Teddy Roosevelt through the window and then screamed into a pillo…
@CoryVillneff @caminvan @ConservativeLA the messaging from the WH has been horrible on this. cause for firing of comey is still just. Trump grossly underestimated fallout.
@bravesbasebawls @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood i'm great. miserable is the fever swamp on the left who have to react negatively to everything trump does, regardless of whether they agree.
@TheSeaFarmer @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood he's not running the investigation anyway. DOJ is convening the grand juries.
@Helo1138 @JohnJHarwood hypocrisy abounds with both parties, to be sure. but john podesta literally criticized comey yesterday morning, defended him last night.
@Lemon_Wizard @JohnJHarwood don't think so. takes 67 senators to impeach. House barely got majority to repeal obamacare. wouldn't have gone after her right away.
@QuockerWodging @JohnJHarwood read a bit before commenting on what you think you know for a change.
@McFaul McCabe still actually running the investigation, right? If Trump shuts him down, then we have big problems. axing comey is defensible.
@caminvan @ConservativeLA comey got caught in testimony last week playing attorney general instead of FBI director, DOJ didn't like it, recommended Trump axe him.
@caminvan @ConservativeLA nope. because mccabe is still running the investigation like he always has. if trump goes after him, then yes, i'm worried. nothing changed.
@estheramma @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood Excuse me, moron, google the name McCabe &amp; FBI. you'll be surprised to learn that he's running the investigation, and is acting director.
@5dodgerfans @JohnJHarwood i think you lefties were okay with transgendered people regardless of their age. why are you making jokes at their expense? blocked, btw.
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood liberty is not a campaign promise. it's a founding principle. Progressivism has been attacking that for over a century.
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood how is liberty and choice reaching? Are these issues that are the meta that health care reform is a surrogate for?
@sarahfdavis280 @nickmirto @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood excuse me, troll, who are you again? don't you have a freeway to go play on?
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood wasn't that taxation of income? where exactly in the 16th A does it declare that congress may tax people,forcing them to engage in commerce?
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood You're all about choice when it comes to taking life of the unborn, right? why shouldn't that liberty be applied to grown ups?
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood I will always counter with liberty, which is what this country was founded upon. Why shouldn't people get to choose whether to participate?
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood or are we the kind of country where people get to choose whether or not they will participate in a system, or whether they must be compelled
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood I believe that progressivism is the root and the threshold to all evil in the world. You don't. But we need to have that fight. It matters.
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood i wish, frankly, they would. that's the ideological fight this country needs to have once and for all.
@sarahfdavis280 @JohnJHarwood keep up with the deplorables. that played so well in pennsylvania, wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan.
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood I'm telling you, Comey ain't the battle to pick. Colbert's audience of fever swamp kids cheered wildly that comey was fired. they hate him.
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood ...disagree. but rather than being reactionary and criticizing Trump for everything he does solely because he's Trump, pick your battles.
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood he actually, from a policy standpoint thus far and with his cabinet, has the makings of a good president from my worldview. i know you...
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood agreed for the most part. I wish he'd stop with Twitter. he's refined what he says on it, but still pops off too much for my liking.
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood ...doing that they have to delegitimize Trump in everything he does in order to keep from facing the problems they have internally.
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood ...rather than deal with why they lost, meaning the fact that Hillary sucked something awful as a candidate and misread how well she was...
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood ...again over-generalizing, cannot come to grips with the fact that hillary lost this thing when they all thought it was in the bag, and...
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood no doubt that he brought a lot of this on himself. fully concede that point. But you have to also understand and admit that the left...
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood agreed. hopefully, you understand why i went to the bio angle when you went back and read what led up to it.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood see? apparently a conversation can be had between the right and the left.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood but i'm not going to go rachel maddow and report on smoke every day when there's North Korea, Iran, China, Middle East to worry about.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood all fair questions. and i believe all are being investigated. perhaps one day, they'll be investigated by special prosecutor.
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood but with susan collins, richard burr, and several Republican senators concerned with this move, a replacement pick won't be rubber stamped
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood a new appointee will get roasted over the coals in confirmation committee. now obviously, thanks to Harry Reid, only takes 52 to confirm.
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood I'd say probably not. I firmly believe it was because his boasting of how he interpreted intent in the classified info statute was too much.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood i'm not afraid of the truth. if there was criminality and it's proven, i'll go where the evidence goes. right now, no there there publicly.
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood irrelevant why he would have been fired in my hypothetical. i'm saying the democrats would have reacted partisan, not principled.
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood His testimony to Senate Judiciary last Thursday simply was the last straw. it was a righteous firing.
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood DOJ still running oversight with same staff, being that Session recused. Grand Jury allegedly still operating. no reason for freakout here.
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood but much more important, nothing changes with russia investigation with this firing. FBI still investigating with same staff.
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood my reaction was that Hillary making it personal if she'd won and got even with someone who tried to screw her over would've had meh reaction
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood but that's my meta point. it doesn't have to be a confusing time. the left, by and large, is reacting that Trump is fascist with this move.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood rumor ain't fact. if it's so, the grand jury should have no problem indicting, right?
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood i believe he can submit who he wants, but that is a presidential selection, and it is senate confirmed.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood and if he does do that, Maxine waters will be the happiest person on Earth.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood including me.
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood You can hold onto that belief, but less than a week ago, Dems were essentially calling for Comey to resign, and now he's their hero.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood and Comey chose McCabe, who again, remains in charge of the investigation, and i believe is now the acting director of the Bureau.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood Until then, I'm all about going on what we've seen thus far, which is that Flynn appears dirty, but he acted relatively alone.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood i have no idea if there is or isn't. No smoking gun has been presented. If so, there'd be indictments. But if grand jury does, i'll face it.
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood i know what history based on the study of the clintons for 25 years teaches. You're not old enough to have followed Arkansas Clintons.
@BryanRichards1 @CoryVillneff @JohnJHarwood ...away with bouncing either one of them. Republicans would not be able to support it. He's boxed in now.
@BryanRichards1 @CoryVillneff @JohnJHarwood honestly, what has changed? Actually, right now, it's fair to say that McCabe and DOJ number 2 are more empowered. Trump could never get...
@BryanRichards1 @CoryVillneff @JohnJHarwood how is it inconsequential when the investigation is active, DOJ retains right to call for special prosecutor, &amp; grand juries are empaneled?
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood certainly your opinion, wrong, though, it may be.
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood oh, but i do. 25 yrs of study of how the Clintons operate provides a nice history of retribution for disloyalty to them. fair predictor.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood You're acting as if Comey is personally running this investigation. He's not. Never was. McCabe, number 2, is. he's still there.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood exactly, because in this hypothetical, there is an active criminal referral that Hillary is trying to quash. So far, Trump hasn't done that.
@meat @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood you apparently have never been to law school before, or colleges that don't specialize in safe spaces. hypotheticals can prove a lot.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood no, because Comey was not running the investigation. McCabe was and is. If Trump bounced McCabe and his staff at FBI, then I'd say yes.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood i inferred. sorry if i was not precise. my timeline makes perfect sense if DOJ cringed at Comey testimony last week and said he has to go.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood ...meaning he tried to fire the number two and block the special prosecutor, that would be grounds to me putting him in Nixon camp.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood If DOJ number 2 used this to say too politicized, we need a special prosecutor, i'm perfectly fine with it. And if Trump interceded...
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood sorta pours water on your conspiracy theory about Trump trying to squash the investigation, yes? I'm a conservative. Let me tell you this.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood Number two at DOJ is in charge of oversight since Sessions recused. another obama holdover. investigation/grand jury continues.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood If Flynn is crooked, he'll fry. McCabe, the number two at FBI, was and still is running the investigation. he's an Obama holdover.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood Based on his testimony, DOJ made their recommendation, and four business days later, Trump acted. Again, nothing changes with investigation
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood He essentially admitted that he was channeling his inner Supreme Court justice instead of following the law. You can't have that at FBI.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood comey testified late last week to Senate Judiciary that he didn't see intent or knowledge that HIllary/Huma knew they were breaking the law.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood meaning if he would have criminally referred Hillary or Huma based on breaking classified intel law, &amp; Hillary fired him? impeachment.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood the hypocrisy angle was in response to John Harwood's tweet that was too rich not to drop the hypothetical.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood The left largely doesn't want to get into this, because it's exculpatory for Trump's decision to fire him.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood Any military intel officer who shares classified info w/anyone w/out a clearance, there is no intent part to consider. They're prosecuted.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood for that and that alone, and bragging about it last week in testimony to the Judiciary Committee, he had to go.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood But it is absolutely not the job of the top cop in the land to decide there was no intent, interpreting the statute, and declining to refer.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood now certainly, courts can decide whether the statute is constitutional. prosecutors at DOJ can decide whether case should be pursued.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood i will try with you. there is cause for the action. if you go read the classified information statute, no intent is required to break law.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood Chuck and Nancy, and to a larger extent, Bernie, represent what's left of leadership of the party at this point. seems a fair citation, yes?
@BryanRichards1 @CoryVillneff @JohnJHarwood you're forgiven. If you want people to know you, so that a rhetorical mistake is not made, perhaps tend to your bio every once in a while.
@thevictorgallo @JohnJHarwood i have given the cause for why Comey was fired, which has nothing to do with leftist hypocrisy. Harwood's hypocrisy was too rich to pass up.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood easy deduction to make. Chuck Schumer himself wanted Comey gone a year ago. So did many Dems. Now they praise him just because he was fired?
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood so again, your partisan slant can claim self-evidence, but that doesn't make it all men are created equal self-evident. it's hyperbolic.
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood except his comey isn't investigating Trump. McCabe is. Try to keep up. McCabe is still there. Sessions recused. Career #2 at DOJ overseeing.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood I answered his larger point. he's more than able to offer a rebuttal. He hasn't and apparently won't. He has his anti-Trump narrative.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood He hasn't had any affiliation after a quick search for 8 years. seems fraudulant to me to not update your bio after that long.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood i looked at his bio, clicked on the affiliation he represented to have. it errored out. i googled him to see if it was a bad link.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood absolutely not. he said i don't know him when he wasn't answering the evidence i cited to refute his claim about threat to democracy.
@thevictorgallo @JohnJHarwood they're called hypotheticals, moron. Lots of people use them to make points and eventually learn things.
@yulebones @JohnJHarwood you're right, because Bob Menendez, who is a crook who took plane rides on a donor's plane to an island for sex romps, has been bounced.
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood personal attacks are not harmful one way only. I am resting on the facts of why Comey was bounced. You're playing partisan politics. Fine.
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood I called you a troll and a fraud, based on your inaccurate bio claiming an affiliation that hasn't seemed to have been valid for 8 years.
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood absolute nonsense. he had cause, because Comey as top cop didn't enforce the classified info statute on Hillary and Huma as written.
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood you accuse me of being childish, (which is personal, by the way). You are not profane, neither am I.
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood they are not personal attacks. you refuse to deal with the reality that nothing changes at DOJ or FBI vis-a-vis Trump/Russia.
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood whatever, troll. Hope you find gainful employment somewhere that recognizes your affiliation.
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood All i asked you is how democracy as we know it has been destroyed, as you intimated. You didn't answer. meanwhile, i learned about you.
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood i explained in detail who was running investigation and now the Bureau, and who was overseeing at DOJ. nothing has changed with comey out.
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood just was responding to your charge that i do not know you. was getting acquanted. as for issue at hand, you have not dealt with reality.
@CoryVillneff @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood so a fraudulant bio is low hanging fruit. i guess credibility isn't a thing on the left anymore. good to know.
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood so you still won't tell me how democracy as we know it is doomed because of comey firing when i tell you who's left in charge at DOJ/FBI
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood i'm not making it personal at all. you are. you told me i knew nothing about you. that's fair. i went and looked. you appear to be a poseur
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood googles shows that you reviewed a few things in 2007 and 2009, nothing recent. So how much of a poseur are you? Please inform me.
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood now about not knowing you. the website you link on your bio shows no affiliation with you. you're not a contributor on their current roster.
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood btw, bryan, still living off your 2007-2009 glory years for a website that doesn't show you as a contributor any longer?
@RosieGray @jeff_poor @Olivianuzzi he'd never be confirmed, unless all 52 Republicans have a delightful sense of humor.
@wtime90 @JohnJHarwood you're delusional. perhaps you should quit drinking for the rest of the evening.
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood i realize we're talking past each other because you are a nitwit and a hypocrite, but i get it plain and clear. This was totally justified.
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood he was bounced for cause. it was a justified bounce. hillary would have bounced him because it was personal, and the left would have blessed
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood if he wanted to be a supreme court justice so he could interpret law from the bench, perhaps he should have lobbied Obama for the Kagan seat
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood instead of comey playing cop and saying yes, they broke the law, here's the criminal referrals, DOJ, he read in intent where it isn't in law
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood the classified information statute is crystal clear. you cannot share intel with people who don't have clearance or else. hillary/huma did.
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood so what exactly has been unconstitutional here, except that Comey got way, way out in front of his skis and played judge instead of cop?
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood what democracy is threatened here? McCabe is still running the investigation and the Bureau. Number 2 at DOJ is still in charge of oversight
@laprofe63 don't you have stephen colbert to go watch to get your news?
@nickmirto @BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood doesn't seem to be at this point. if anyone fries, it's flynn, who acted stupidly. he may go down, but he's been long gone from West Wing.
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood oh, spare me. the left doesn't have adult conversations anymore. Would you have decried the Comey firing by Hillary? Nope. enjoy hypocrisy.
@laprofe63 25 years of study of the political history of the clintons tells you a lot about how they'd operate. You choose to ignore history. fine.
@TruthSeeker526 @JohnJHarwood don't have to read her mind. all you have to do is follow her political career for the last 25 years.
@skinhorse you really need to put down the crack pipe if you believe there would have been no recriminations from the Clintons to Comey, had she won.
@skinhorse No bad deed against the Clintons ever goes unpunished. She was furious at Comey for his actions. She would have bounced him without a doubt.
@BryanRichards1 @JohnJHarwood what's absurd. you don't believe hillary would have fired comey if she won the presidency? you're delusional. put the bong down, sir.
@SpacePirate_JFT @Kyle_Beckley @ConservativeLA it's driven them literally insane.
@SpacePirate_JFT @ConservativeLA i'm fine with it. kinda hard to order DOJ #2 to name one, though. that would be viewed as political.
@JohnJHarwood john, you know POTUS Hillary would have fired Comey first week. No one on the left would have said boo. Can you gut-check hypocrisy?
@ConservativeLA @SpacePirate_JFT i have no problem with that. DOJ #2 has to have a reason why they haven't moved, yet. perhaps there's no there there, outside of flynn.
@ConservativeLA @SpacePirate_JFT why they won't call for special prosecutor isn't about threat of recrimination. Trump boxed himself in. he couldn't interfere, get away w/it
@ConservativeLA @SpacePirate_JFT understand. DOJ #2 can appoint a special prosecutor tonight, tomorrow, whenever. Sessions won't interfere. If Trump does, he's finished.
@SpacePirate_JFT @RealCaliSteve @ConservativeLA correct. Still, a special prosecutor could be named tomorrow, without interference by Sessions. If Trump interceded that, he'd be finished.
@SpacePirate_JFT @ConservativeLA Obama holdover at DOJ has that power today. Had it yesterday and the day before. Maybe waiting on evidence of a crime first before acting?
@ConservativeLA @SpacePirate_JFT no reason #2 at DOJ couldn't have already done that, well before Comey's bad day today. Maybe she's waiting for, i don't know, evidence.
@ConservativeLA fair enough. today, however, it's the democrat hypocrisy ox being gored. Hillary fires him, 100%. no Dem steps up to save him. laughable.
@SpacePirate_JFT @ConservativeLA if there's a case that's presented, and the obama holdover running DOJ Trump/Russia agrees it's a problem, special prosecutor will be named.
@SpacePirate_JFT @ConservativeLA Nothing at all changed with the Trump/Russia investigation. And Sessions isn't dealing with decision to prosecute if evidence turns up.
@SpacePirate_JFT @ConservativeLA nope. if trump does it, it has to be bad and impeachable. McCabe is still running the investigation, and temporarily, the Bureau.
@SpacePirate_JFT @ConservativeLA and huma shares with carlos danger, who's own identity and his alter ego neither have a clearance.
@SpacePirate_JFT @ConservativeLA 100%. and that's, at the end of the day, is why he got bounced. final straw.
@ConservativeLA agreed. this is so simple to see what this was about. And the left can't help but relaunch their "burn the witch" strategy.
@ConservativeLA that's just plain hypocrisy. Had Hillary won, she would have bounced Comey first week as retribution, and no Dem would have batted an eye.
@ConservativeLA tell that to any military with intelligence clearance who shares with someone without clearance. intent does not matter. it's not in the law
@kb9rqz yes, they did. clear as crystal. up to prosecutors to decide whether to pursue. he had duty to do criminal referral, not read into statute.
@kb9rqz wrong. it's not the FBI's job to play attorney general/prosecutor and decide what's proper to prosecute. just the facts. did they break law?
if you just read the classified information statute, Hillary &amp; Huma violated the law. Comey saw intent where it wasn't codified. Fatal error https://t.co/5yLkNedlIV
@brianjacksonXP @hughhewitt @Lileks yes, you do. lopsided, as usual.
@madsenc Yeah, but this doesn't really do that. This actually caused schumer to double down on calls for special prosecutor
@Mattfobrien Long, long list of self-inflicted wounds to then-Candidate Trump, wasn't there?
@MsRachelMc Indeed, but you can't ignore the left-right angle here. Unfortunately, that permeates everything now.
@Weapon_o_Choice Right. McCabe is still there.
@madsenc And you're telling me what breaking news about this administration again? His base will love this.
@Mattfobrien Optics don't seem to be of much concern to this administration. To be fair, left would have excoriated over Comey regardless.
@madsenc No, of course not, but that's optics and political more than legal issue. Comey got caught playing judge instead of cop. That's why.
@MsRachelMc Comey got out too far in front of his skis, Team Trump saw another public appearance coming, had enough and stopped it.
@MsRachelMc Again, the left will look for conspiracy theories everywhere with trump, sometimes very justifiably so. This wasn't that, I believe.
@madsenc His best action would have been to read the classified info statute as written and recommended criminal referral of Hillary and Huma.
@alibertarian I'm fine. Hopefully, podcast wrinkles got ironed out
@Mattfobrien You're absolutely right. But I counter with Comey himself not being an ideal situation. I hated his "intent" thumb on the scale for hillary
@madsenc His role was to determine if the law was broken and refer the charges. He instead played the role of judge/prosecutor, read intent into law
@madsenc That's not why I would have fired him. he wouldn't recommend prosecution of Hilary or Huma for ignorance or no intent. that's not his role.
@Mattfobrien The left will affix their trump/Russia tin foil hats on to see the deeper meaning here. Reality is his testimony last week was last straw.
@MsRachelMc No, not really. If you think Comey was the lone, sole agent working on Trump/Russia, he wasn't. His testimony last week was the last straw.
4/4 Comey's fatal flaw was he thought he was a US Attorney or judge, and forgot he was a cop whose job is to enforce the law. He had to go.
3/4 Comey lost confidence of the right for interpreting classified info statute, reading in intent where it was not there.
2/3 Comey lost the confidence of the left for being perceived to have politicized the bureau during last election cycle.
While I believe James Comey is a man of personal integrity, meaning he thought he was doing the right thing, he had to go. 1/2
@ConservativeLA @CG_Cynic @Mr_Fastbucks @michaelbeck and some drivers, too, i'm afraid. i hate plate racing. it's just utter nonsense. let 'em run.

@JolenesTrailer @Rakman2000 @hughhewitt you are so full of it. health care was never the issue and you know it. any er room provides care. it's about cost and who pays for it.

@MikeRathbone86 that would be appropriate, but it's not technically necessary. It would be wise to do, however.
@engineerwin Ah, the intelligence coming from your fingertips. It's overwhelming, actually.
@susanferrechio @mkraju agreed. if it escalates, Congress will need to be brought in. if a one-off message sent, nothing further needed.
@engineerwin I could have, but then I would have been spared your mindless profanity, which always elevates the discourse.
@susanferrechio @mkraju yeah, my guess is if McCain faced this situation and were president, he would have acted as well. Sarin use can't be tolerated.
@DavidMDrucker so Assad and Ann Coulter are in agreement. Finally.
@susanferrechio if it extends to direct conflict with russian, then yes, congressional action necessary. but treaty we signed obligated us to act.
@engineerwin It's not a legitimate question. it's nuttery. It was fixed wings that dropped the sarin on the village. only fixed wings in area are syrian.

CNN, perhaps if you spent nearly as much time trying to cover up this story as actually covering it, you might regain some credibility.
CNN, no matter how hard you will the world into saying these aren't the Susan Rice droids you're looking for, this is a big deal.
CNN, you'd be falling all over yourselves at how much journalistic malpractice Fox News engaged in by trying to tamp down that story.
CNN, imagine your reaction if Fox News went to Michael Flynn, asked him if he did anything wrong, he said no, Fox claimed stories all false.
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO So did the Republicans in Congress who won elections in 2010, '12, '14 and '16.
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO government broken. reid broke it. McConnell, with Reid Rule here, goes back to precedent that Senate doesn't filibuster SC picks.
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO so you were in a coma from 2001 - 2005? you forgot that leahy filibustered dozens of bush picks?
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO false. dem decision here based on total fear of michael moore and fever swamp threatening to primary them if they don't walk the plank.
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO no nominee in 80 yrs has been approved in the final year of a presidency with opposing congress. play your reverse hypothetical all you want
@SteveMundie @JonahNRO poison was dems filibusters dozens of bush appellate nominees in 2001-2005. venom followed on both sides. but it started there.
@mo_sabet but you're missing the key word here, because it ruins your argument. fortas was corrupt, and both sides knew it. that's not applied here.
@mo_sabet borking helped lead to where we are, that along with dem filibuster of bush appellate judges in 2001-2005. bork didn't help himself.
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO still waiting for your example i asked for, which was another time SC pick was filibustered on the floor of the senate.
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO Sherman Minton in 1956. Ike nominated him, senate didn't act. presidential year. ike recess appointed him while senate was on break.
@SteveMundie @JonahNRO which is not constitutionally required under advice and consent clause. this is different. gorsuch is on the floor for consideration now.
@mo_sabet but please line up for your consolation prize, and thanks for playing. what happened today is still unprecedented in American history.
@mo_sabet bipartisan filibuster, and it was because fortas was corrupt. neither apply here. Gorsuch well-qualified according to ABA, and it's partisan
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO untrue. not with an opposing Senate.
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO Dude, take the life raft before you drown. You have no legitimate argument. Precedent and Constitutional law totally on our side this time.
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO Precedent set by 80 years. Joe Biden just verbally reaffirming it in '92 is just icing on the irony cake.
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO there is 80 years of precedent of denying a president a SC pick to replace a vacancy in their final year w/Senate of opposing party.
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO which has zero to do with the partisan filibuster ongoing on the floor right now. You can't play the game without trying to divert attention
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO And poor Merrick Garland would be discarded as the pawn Barack Obama always intended for him to be.
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO You can't convince me that this "they stole Merrick Garland's seat" meme is real. If Hillary won, she'd appoint someone further left.
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO today is partisan hackery. nothing short of it. If Hillary had won, there isn't a Democrat alive who would have mentioned Merrick Garland.
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO Still waiting for you to give me a name while you textually flounder around trying to defend what you can't defend. Still waiting.
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO Keep trying. Name me the one SC nominee on the floor of the Senate who had a partisan filibuster. Just one. I'll be here waiting.
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO No POTUS has had a SC vacancy filled w/opposing Senate in 80 years. Senate gave Obama advice and consent. They advised not to make the pick.
@Almonte ah, nice try, snowflake. You can whatabout all you want. I'm not budging. The Democrats are in uncharted territory here. you're deflecting.
@pandard66 nothing Constitutional about either a cloture vote or the SC filibuster. And yes, the Democrats are worse on this, on every objective level.
@SteveMundie @JonahNRO Again, what does that have to do with Democrats doing a partisan filibuster on a SC nominee on the floor for the first time ever?
@SteveMundie @JonahNRO It's their role to do so. Republicans have done budgets. Democrats didn't from '08-'12. They punted with continuing resolutions.
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO not true. Joe Biden said it from the Senate floor in 1992. Honestly, do you let everyone else do your thinking and research for you?
@rB777ftw @LLunaTrexing @JonahNRO Guess we'll never know if they would have done that or not.
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO don't chase the squirrels because your argument is weak. stick to the facts, if you dare.
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO wholly irrelevant. Are you saying Gorsuch had interference with the Russians? The ABA is unaware of that. He's well-qualified.
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO 80 years. only has happened once, in fact, since 1880s. and precedent is for a vacancy that occurs in the final year of office - election yr
@rB777ftw @LLunaTrexing @JonahNRO i'm not insane, and they would have.
@rB777ftw @LLunaTrexing @JonahNRO elections have consequences. we didn't filibuster sotomayor or kagan.
@SteveMundie @JonahNRO In this particular democratic republic, we turned that issue into an election issue. Let the people decide who gets the pick. You're not ok?
@SteveMundie @JonahNRO What, following the Constitution? You bet.
@LLunaTrexing @JonahNRO as Dennis Prager would say, i prefer clarity over agreement. I can handle disagreement. I just push back at factual fallacy over this.
@philoking @RealAlexJones thanks for the promotion. Hughniverse subscribers will love to have more people come on board who, like them, think Alex Jones is nuts.
@philoking @realDonaldTrump @AlexJones And the laugh riot? That's when Kennedy or Ginsberg steps down and is replaced by another conservative and the Dems can't stop it.
@philoking @realDonaldTrump @AlexJones Enjoy the punchline of Neil Gorsuch on the bench for 30 or 40 years.
@SteveMundie @JonahNRO He said Obama would not get consent. That's all the Constitution technically requires.
@SteveMundie @JonahNRO what part of the Constitution says filibusters of judicial picks are okey-dokey? It says advice and consent. McConnell advised Obama.
@SteveMundie @JonahNRO what constitutional process is that, exactly? i'm just curious. which part of the constitution says hearings have to be scheduled?
@philoking @realDonaldTrump @AlexJones and you laughed when i didn't actually call you a snowflake but treated you like one.
@Nutritionprof1 https://t.co/RFc6Mf51kv yes.
@umbrellaman92 @JonahNRO which is why it needs to get blown up for good on judicial nominations.
@LLunaTrexing @JonahNRO yes, actually, we do. first years of Obama, he nominated Sotomayor and Kagan. both had hearings and votes, no filibuster.
@philoking there is no constitutional mandate to schedule hearings, or, for that matter, for a judicial filibuster. today is unprecedented.
@LLunaTrexing @JonahNRO there is no constitutional mandate that a hearing has to be scheduled. there is also no constitutional talk of a judicial filibuster, either
@LLunaTrexing @JonahNRO denying a hearing is advice and consent. McConnell advised the president not to make a pick, because there would be no consent.
@LLunaTrexing @JonahNRO There is no precedent for Gorsuch. There is for Garland. What McConnell did was never about Garland. He advised Obama before Garland pick.
@philoking @realDonaldTrump If you act the part of a snowflake, i'll gladly role play with you.
@Iron_Scotsman @JonahNRO How is what Joe Biden said any different than what Mitch McConnell did? Still waiting for that partisan filibuster of a SC pick you owe me.
@Iron_Scotsman @JonahNRO yes, it is the case. Tell me the last SC nominee that was filibustered on a partisan basis? Still waiting.
@philoking @realDonaldTrump The precedent is no POTUS with an opposing Senate has had a SC vacancy filled in his final year of office for 80 years. Biden concurred.
@LLunaTrexing @JonahNRO Kennedy and souter were both vacancies that occurred before final year of office. different scenarios. stick to the point.
@philoking divert all you want. I'm talking about precedent for SC filibusters. You are now conceding my point by trying to dodge to another subject.
@RipCitizen_NBA @JonahNRO which is why i can't wait for it to be blown up over SC picks. the filibuster is extra-constitutional when it comes to judicial picks.
@philoking @realDonaldTrump and that would be relevant to the precedent of SC picks how again? So you're discounting your own vice president, huh? Selective history?
@MHjort1776 perhaps.
@Iron_Scotsman @JonahNRO https://t.co/RFc6Mf51kv
@RipCitizen_NBA @JonahNRO You can't tell a story and ignore the first two chapters of the book. It started with Leahy and the Dems in 2001. Period.
@philoking https://t.co/RFc6Mf51kv - I guess Joe Biden doesn't count for precedent, huh? Poor Joe. No one listens to him anymore.
@StPaulExaminer @jpodhoretz @KevinMKruse Name one partisan filibuster of a SC judge. I'm all ears.
@SteveMundie @JonahNRO Good Lord, is there a lefty out there that's honest about history? https://t.co/RFc6Mf51kv Go ahead. i dare you to watch.
@RipCitizen_NBA @JonahNRO nonsense. utter garbage and nonsense. dozens of Bush Appellate picks were filibustered by Leahy and Democrats from 2001-2005.
@Iron_Scotsman @JonahNRO it's actually unprecedented. again, facts and history, they're pretty stubborn things. You can't point to a partisan filibuster of a SC pick
@Iron_Scotsman @JonahNRO i dare you to go look at the video link i just sent you. i double dog dare you.
@LLunaTrexing @JonahNRO Oh, the irony, it burns.  https://t.co/RFc6Mf51kv
@umbrellaman92 @JonahNRO Actually, Democrats have been marching towards it since 2001, when Pat Leahy started wholesale filibusters of Bush appellate court nominees.
@3rdGenAggie @JonahNRO It's fear of Michael Moore and the lefty fever swamp base. They have no heart to filibuster Gorsuch. It's pure defensive politics.
@Iron_Scotsman @JonahNRO Again, that was bipartisan. This isn't. Fortas was corrupt. Gorsuch got well-qualified from ABA. Keep trying. I know you're desperate.
@Iron_Scotsman @JonahNRO Not true. again, go talk to Joe Biden. When he was Senator, he so championed that precedent, it was called the Biden Rule for a while.
@dylanhendricks @JonahNRO You are entitled to your opinions, wrong though they may be. No POTUS had a SC nominee filled in their final year of office w/oppo Senate.
@kurtsmorton It was a filibuster? when was the cloture motion for Garland filed? Words mean things, you know.
@LLunaTrexing @JonahNRO There is precedent for denying Garland. There is no precedent for filibustering a well-qualified judge in 1st year of a presidency.
@LLunaTrexing @JonahNRO Biden said no POTUS gets a SC pick in their final year of office when the Senate is run by the other party. Keep trying.
@Iron_Scotsman @JonahNRO Not true. Garland was not a filibuster. No POTUS in 80 years has had a SC pick in their final year. Ask Joe Biden about that. He'll tell you
@LLunaTrexing @JonahNRO No POTUS with an opposition party running the Senate has gotten a SC nominee in their last year of office. Ask Joe Biden about that.
@jbgaffney @JonahNRO And if you read a book or studied history, you'd know that 80 years have passed since a potus of one party got a SC pick in their last year.
@jbgaffney @JonahNRO Garland was not filibustered, and you know it. Garland never got out of committee. he never got to committee.
@jbgaffney @JonahNRO abe fortas was due to corruption charges, and the filibuster was bipartisan. there has never been a partisan filibuster of a SC nominee.
Stop, drop and cover, Democrats, because the Senate is about to go nuclear.
@CharlieAtSalem i'm fully prepared if evidence turns up that Trump colluded w/Russians. The left is not at all ready for the boomerang that happened today.
@politicsofone Nope. America gets a pass. I'm just going to sit back and revel in the media running away from this story like Monty Python's Holy Grail bit
For all this talk about Trump did this unprecedented thing or that, Senate Dems filibustering a supreme court pick is truly unprecedented.
And if Obama was legitimately out of the loop on what his NSA was up to, what does that say about the governing/leadership ability of Obama?
If Susan Rice was manipulating intel collected on Trump team, unmasked people for political purposes, how could Obama not know?
Mike Flynn advised the campaign, was actually NSA for Trump for what, two weeks? Rice was NSA for four years. How out of the loop was Obama?
So, lefties, if Mike Flynn wrongdoings means Trump had to be involved, therefore impeachment necessary, what say you about Susan Rice now?

Part of that truth judgment people make should include the biases of the people in media trying to claim what truth is.
It's not just a double standard, but one that has a fallacy as a premise. Truth is for everyone to judge, not just MSM'ers and fact checkers
lefties don't respect that judges have to judge, so they can't reveal any opinions on issues. MSM lefties think they're judges of truth.
...and yet when journos are in the hot seat, and they don't want to own their own ideology, they expect a pass. total double standard.

@Almonte there were only three planks in it that were worth saving. rest was garbage. still is. but hey, you're happy. all that matters, eh?
@mkhammer meet the new boss. same as the old boss.
@Almonte you can't agree that the insurance companies are leaving because they've said it's economically unsustainable for them to stay?
@Almonte or your anti-russian angst is only directed to Trump? You do know Hillary sold US uranium to Russia for Bill' speaking fees, right?
@Almonte here we go. and you're totally okay with john podesta actually working with russian interest while campaign manager of hillary?
@Almonte they were trying to improve it. they were keeping the three planks that made sense, and improving the rest. not one Dem went along.
@Almonte you're out of your mind. They're leaving because economically, they're taking a bath and it's financially unsustainable for them.
@Almonte as long as you got yours, force everyone else to participate, even if they don't want to? you're good with all that, comrade?
@Almonte you're just fine with many pockets of the country seeing triple digit premium hikes? deductibles that can't be met?
@Almonte then you are okay with humana and aetna leaving, many pockets of country with zero insurer options in the exchanges by '18?
@kb9rqz i thought that's what most of the house gop were trying to do up until today?
I want to publicly show the Freedom Caucus members' inane strategy would never have worked. Can't do anything about the charlie dent mods.
Paul Ryan should dust off last year's clean repeal bill and repass it right now. wouldn't only take a few days to do. let senate kill it.
@kb9rqz it is but it just got remarkably better, all things being equal. GOP needs to rack up some wins elsewhere, economy has to get going.
@kb9rqz which would be a bigger disaster than what happened today by an order of magnitude.
@cohasset_kid not sure. my guess is we'll find out if dems take over.
@Almonte and again, you have failed to outline what the proper replacement framework should have been that could have passed.
@Almonte i didn't say this bill was doomed to fail. i said obamacare is doomed to fail, because, well, it is failing.
What's funny is watching Democrats take credit for the self-inflicted disaster put on by the Republicans today.
They had their chance to change trajectory. Instead, displayed inability to legislate. If they lose senate/WH by '20, single payer coming.
Obamacare as we know it is doomed to fail. What's disturbing is that GOP failure might inadvertently open door to single payer option.
Humana leaves the exchanges this year. Aetna not sure it'll be there in '18. Tom Price will continue to unwind Obamacare rules and regs.
@Almonte this was repeal stage and medicaid reform. could never be final law due to not 60 votes in senate.
@StephensWSJ To be fair, Neil Gorsuch alone makes this administration not a failure.
@Almonte disagree. was a very good framework with which to start. tell me what your bill would have included.
2/2 Freedom Caucus wouldn't have had that as excuse to go against today's bill. RIP entitlement reform.
Biggest tactical failure of House GOP leadership? They should've offered clean repeal bill 1st. Would have passed House, died in Senate 1/2
@mlee99z I have cancer, and am supremely disappointed this bill went down. Costs will only continue to rise now. @mkhammer
@cohasset_kid i told him about roswell. he expanded its area 51 times on his own.
@michaelbeck the freedom caucus could easily make their case after bill returns to house. but no rational reason not to let senate tweak it.
@michaelbeck send it to the senate, see if they can improve it. if they can't, it'll die or come back flawed to the house. vote no then.
@michaelbeck normally. what is maddening about all this is this should be an easy vote. even if you don't like the bill, vote yes.
@Rowdyyates1 i really hope it was just a trial balloon by chuck schumer trying to tempt McConnell. don't think it'll work.

@madsenc we disagree. you're missing the point.
@ConservativeLA So far, Geraldo Rivera is calling, asking for the return of his crown for biggest explosive nothingburger story in history.
@ConservativeLA the release of the return, regardless of who leaked, isn't complete, and certainly didn't warrant the insane hype by rachel.
@ConservativeLA but from what i see in the page summary, 25.3% effective net tax rate. but returns don't show source of income.

@caminvan doesn't change the fact that after a year of fbi investigation thus far, there's still no evidence of a crime.
@caminvan msm will dog him about it forever. they have a vested interest in destroying him. they're liberals, mostly.
@caminvan so the fbi investigating is all the standard you need for guilt? if so, well, then, what about that Hillary Clinton?
@caminvan he's not hiding his actions. he said he had no contact with the russians about the campaign. so far, that hasn't been proven false
@Crapgame13 contact is not a crime. senators talk to ambassadors all the time. that's normal business. show me evidence of collusion.
@JMNR if there's evidence of Trump chicanery vis-a-vis the Russians, i'll happily go where the evidence leads. This is weak tea thus far.
@CG_Cynic @ConservativeLA @BreckNichols ok, i'll do a repeat tomorrow night.
If this is all you have, and you're expecting mass resignations and/or impeachment, dream on. So far, this is a nothingburger story.
If there's actual evidence of a crime, and not just lefties and NeverTrumpers trying to prove themselves right about Trump, bring it.
This entire day was an Obama-staff pin fed to MSM who was looking for anything to deflate air out of the Trump speech to Congress balloon.
Especially since the FBI has already looked into this for more than a year and produced nothing criminal. Senators do talk to ambassadors.
Jeff Sessions recused himself, allowing investigation to go forward. doesn't sound like the act of someone worried about the results.
Eric Holder never recused himself over Fast and Furious investigation. Loretta Lynch never recused over Bill Clinton being on her plane.

100's of hours of CNN back room baseball coming out? That's any media outlets' worst fear. Smart play would be to own it and mea culpa.
Trump could easily pivot to pointing out the nonsense MSM reports, but do so without giving them a rhetorical life raft in the process.
By exaggerating and doubling down on provable misstatements, Trump allows MSM to stay in the game, even though MSM is hyperbolic a lot.
Real story here, of course, is if Trump were more honest in his claims about the media, stayed on factual footing, MSM would look even worse

RT @BigMcLrgHuge: @EdMorrissey @crousselle @Radioblogger @hughhewitt Only commies like toasted coconut.
whataboutism at its worst right here. he's apparently morally equivocating the defense of a 13 year old giving consent to sex w/an adult. https://t.co/hE5czKoAlz
@EdMorrissey dream on, hater. you and your other MSM'ers will soon learn that your cookie agenda isn't America's cookie agenda.
@MaryStewart01 i understand his story. i'm saying a 13 year old can't give legal consent to sex w/an adult. he defended that. indefensible.
@MaryStewart01 he has ever right to say it. he has no right to be immune from consequences for saying it.
@MaryStewart01 pro tip - don't say 13 year olds can give consent to a sexual relationship with an adult. problem solved.
@EdMorrissey let it play out, mr. push poll. time, and mints, are on my side. everyone knows this.

@Naner1969 every party needs a pooper, i guess.
@CharlieAtSalem so i'm an elitist? heh. i drove a souped up mustang for 5 years. went fast, didn't turn. thin mints corner very nicely.
@EdMorrissey dude, you are so wrong. no wonder you're headed to CPAC.
@guypbenson just like sandusky kinda ruined penn state's brand, and cosby ruined his own brand, milo ruined his brand here, i think.
@hughhewitt i'll leave it to twitter to adjudicate my alleged heresy. thin mints rank #2 on cookie depth chart below toll house choc. chip.
@tonyjenson except an empty box of thin mints is much more egregious.
@guypbenson if he says something that over the top, and the public reaction is negative, that's not censorship. that's the market at work.
@guypbenson that's fair, but one is not immune from market-based consequences for saying something awful. this seems like that to me.
@hughhewitt except they're the wrong kind. there is only one definitive girl scout cookie - the thin mint. all others are #fakecookies
@PhilipTaylor16 if you saw trump's announcement, he also said bolton would be in the mix in a different capacity. no recovery necessary.
@MaryEHurley no potus in 80 years with a vacancy in their last year and opposing congress got a supreme court pick. not one. long precedent

@rghtwngextrmst no, there won't, unless all the snow pack is wasted and dumped into the ocean. and then that will be a manmade drought.
@CrzSwissEng snow pack on sierras is over 200% of normal with reservoirs already full. and more snow is on the way this weekend.drought done
@rghtwngextrmst nope. they're saying there will still be snow at mammoth in july. snow pack is over 200% of normal and season isn't done.
@Reilly724 @TheRickWilson as for epshsteyn, he's not confirmed by senate. don't know much about him or his ties. he's coms, not policy, tho.
@Reilly724 @TheRickWilson tillerson was vetted by the senate. dems found nothing on him vis a vis russia. other two weren't outside vetted.
@TheRickWilson agree w/ all 5 q's. baseline, tho, is russia conflict cancers are mostly gone, right? flynn/manafort? only 1 left is trump?
@TheRickWilson hey, that's my handle, buddy.

@imillhiser the gorsuch pick was from a list created and vetted by the federalist society - apples and oranges. gorsuch will be just fine.
@ConservativeLA at least he fell on his sword and one of the potential achilles heels are not there anymore. baby steps.
@SenWarren writes the woman who campaigned for the best friend wall street ever had - Hillary Clinton
@NARNfan @hughhewitt rain here is cyclical. every 7-8 years, we get clobbered. might be smart to build more reservoirs in the dry years.
@karldotcom all of LA's DWP usage for 2016, county-wide, is spilled by oroville in 5.5 days. the drought nonsense was just that - nonsense.
@karldotcom not at all. i'm just saying the "saving" we did was for nothing. when the eventual rain happens, all of the savings go away.
@michaelbeck either one of two things. she's not as inside as she thinks she is, or Trump changed his mind after she went on tv.
@VirtualTal it's a state problem. the feds consult, but it's a state problem. nice try.
@karldotcom why hasn't anyone worked on the dam, come up w/an alternative place to store the water? instead, we're farting around w/trains
So Oroville Dam's waterletting thanks to CA Dems not doing their job wiped out 72,000 home usage savings in an hour. 1.728 million in a day.
that means everything you saved by not watering went away at Oroville in .05 seconds. that's 20 average house lawns per second. 1,200/minute
The quick stats on what Oroville Dam is flushing away? 100,000 cubic feet per second. average lawn water usage for a year is 5,333 cubic ft.
@jonallendc with the abortion issue, there is no neutrality. you're either for it or agin it. best to describe what both sides are for.
@jonallendc yes. they're pro-life. just like pro-choicers are not anti-lifers, might be best to describe what they're for, not against.
@jonallendc come on, jon, can't you call them what they are, pro-life? is Cecile Richards part of the anti-life movement? be fair.
@marioc WH could ask for en banc at 9th circuit (full court hearing). eats time. then appeal to Supremes, which will have Gorsuch seated.
@Mattfobrien very possible. most likely scenario is redraft and reissue of eo. first one was kinda clunky anyway. may just be do over.
@Mattfobrien by the time they'd hear the appeal, it would be in april session. gorsuch will be confirmed by then.
it's a 52-48 senate with 48 hell bent on obstruction democrats. of course every vote will be narrow. https://t.co/tl0Ly3ZhOq
The 9th Circuit didn't even mention the statute in their decision that gives Trump the power to do the EO. It'll get overturned eventually. https://t.co/9AQgjMHJYz

@johnstodder he said today 100% confidence. No, he's not pulling him. Nice try.
@johnstodder well, you'd certainly know what a troll sounds like, wouldn't you, snowflake?
@johnstodder he lies. obama lies. obama damaged this country. trump's people are trying to fix it. his Court pick is exceptional.
@johnstodder checked your blood pressure lately? i'm worried about your hypertension.
@johnstodder so i guess your bio, which states let your speech always be with grace, that's no longer operational with Trump. ok.
@johnstodder you people? apparently you don't read much, either, because i criticized trump's tweets yesterday &amp; today. keep attacking, tho.
@johnstodder you say your beau as intended to be demeaning. you have a problem w/gays, sport? or is it okay to gay slur if you're a lefty?
@johnstodder it's not a muslim ban, moron. egypt, saudi arabia, indonesia aren't banned. i know you're in socal, but think.
@johnstodder so all the stuff he's done he said he would do leads you to believe he won't follow through with Navy buildup, huh?

@tremlo3 ron bonjean, on the sherpa team for gorsuch, confirmed his comments. period. full stop.
@prudentesvero thing i like the least about this trump tweet is he takes the heat off of elizabeth warren melting down on her twitter feed.
@prudentesvero i agree with everything you said. i'd add that 2 wrongs don't make a right. it was wrong when dems did it. trump wrong, too.
@BartenderEddieJ my guess is lefty MSM won't bring up stolen valor. instead, they'll say both blumenthal and Trump got 5 deferments each.
@JeffKropf it still was an ill-advised tweet. nothing good comes out of it.
@JeffKropf certainly the discouraged part. ron bonjean doesn't make stuff up. and he's not a fake conservative. he's the real deal.
Ron Bonjean, who confirmed what Gorsuch told Blumenthal, did press for both Denny Hastert and Jon Kyl. This tweet was ill-advised. https://t.co/BczoCzI8Je

@artaiz that's what i mean. it's probably a wash. i think this was a signal to sen dems about things to come during gorsuch debate.
@EdMorrissey i at least did something constructive and wrote a column.
@EdMorrissey am i to understand you're complaining you're awake in the middle of the night? i'm looking for my pity button. here somewhere..
@artaiz @EdMorrissey yup. lefty angst will be lefty angst. this is about establishing order and conduct. energizes the right, too.
@artaiz @EdMorrissey well, they'll get shut down, too. rules are rules. kinda glad the senate is now enforcing their own rules.

@Harry_Canyon_ @jimgeraghty walked out after the second time. they ran out of stuff to play, and that band had been around for 20 years.
@ConservativeLA it certainly seems fixable. they've already corrected other parts of it.
@ConservativeLA it's a problem. needs to get fixed. tourism pressure will force it to get fixed. doesn't outweigh the good this week.
@jimgeraghty I actually saw Starship one summer - 12 seat outdoor venue, 3,500 attendance. played this 2x in one show. saddest concert ever.
@ConservativeLA the rollout/execution of this was indefensibly bad. but my guess is this isn't locked in stone now. it'll be rewritten/fixed

@freddoso seems bizarre to me that only walk of life in public sphere that can't talk about politics are pastors in the pulpit.
@freddoso Fair point, but why not let the marketplace decide? if pastors get too out in front of their skis, they pay for it in membership.

@TonySpeak so that's all you got? you get owned and then you divert? enjoy obscurity. you're gonna be there a while.
@TonySpeak By the way, the Gorsuch high school hit job? Didn't actually happen. It was fake news.
@TonySpeak If you're having trouble keeping up, perhaps don't butt into conversations where you end up looking stupid.
@TonySpeak I merely countered that if high school activities now count for public service, where are Obama's Columbia grades.
@TonySpeak @KenRoth slimed Neil Gorsuch for founding a Fascist Forever club in high school, as though that's disqualifying for Court service
@TonySpeak i do. i know @CPLiebau, also pres of HLR. you don't know the context of what you're talking about.
You know, @KenRoth, trying to slime someone with fake news, that's not a very good human rights thing to do to.

@bwdoherty the only stench comes from the protesters. they don't seem to bathe much. hope your vicious words make you feel better.
@bwdoherty Senate rules. the senate makes their own rules. that actually is in the constitution. senate rules for 80 years have been thus.
@bwdoherty doesn't count. he was nominated in '87. the vacancy occurred in 1987. again, those facts, they're stubborn things, snowflake.
@bwdoherty no, it won't, because the dems have to defend too many seats in 2018. they're not getting the senate back. GOP will hold.
@bwdoherty you might not like history. you may want to rewrite history. this isn't Orwell. It's reality. potus doesn't get pick in out year.
@bwdoherty it is not a madeup standard, snowflake. biden cited it 2 decades ago. it has been a practice upheld for 80 years. history counts.

@iamvinod17 i respect your opinion, but don't see that in her. haven't seen any conservative hostile to disability protections.
This is technically what you would expect any president to do, isn't it? Not with Trump. He is all evil to MSM and the left. https://t.co/bWRPovSneA
@iamvinod17 that's fair. not a fan of the department, either. but if it stays, i want a charter schooler running it.

@johnondrasik well then, at least you tried. isn't that enough?
@CharlesEDean @EdMorrissey it would, &amp; no one alive remembers the confirmation vote of any living cabinet member in the past. doesn't matter
@xor MSM shifted immediately to the more important story, which is the court pick. such a snowflake. hold onto your fake news.
@xor right. i meant most MSM weren't talking about it, which is true. only the fever swamp were rallying around fake narratives.
@xor and yet you are using a fake news story to complain about a policy that 6 previous presidents, including 2 dems, advocated for.
@EdMorrissey pence will come to the rescue. she's getting confirmed.
