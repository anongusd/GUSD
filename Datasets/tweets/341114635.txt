Life is strange that way, huh? Do we ever get better at handling life as we age? In my experience, not really. They say with age comes wisdom &amp; that's true to some level, but does it give us the necessary tools to deal with unhappiness, sadness, failure or despair? I have doubt.
One day you're happy. The next day you're not. Sometimes that's one minute you're happy &amp; the next you're not. Life throws you curve ball after curve ball (pardon the baseball metaphor) that you must try to "catch," but often times we dodge them or simply avoid them.

@Smittttttttty @FoxNews @BillClinton Assault weapon is a term used in the U.S. to define types of firearms. The definition varies among jurisdictions, but usually includes semi-automatic firearms w/a detachable magazine &amp; a pistol grip, &amp; sometimes other features such as a flash suppressor or barrel shroud.
@FoxNews @BillClinton Regardless of what a small percentage of Americans think (and the NRA), nobody needs to own an assault weapon. The name itself indicates what it's for: ASSAULT! There needs to be a full ban once and for all. No ifs, ands or buts about it.

Different solutions mean that we have different opinions on how to solve the problem at hand. We have to find a way to meet in the middle and COMPROMISE. I know that's a dirty word in this day and age, but it's the ONLY WAY to truly make a difference in all our lives.
Do I truly believe that Republicans want to see children die in mass shootings? Absolutely not. I think the majority of Republicans, Democrats &amp; Independents want safe environments for our children, ourselves &amp; everyone else. The problem is that we all have DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS!
(5) While laws are certainly not perfect, they are put in place for a reason. And that reason is to protect the innocent as best we possibly can.
(4) That way people can have the freedom to do what they want because they're going to do it regardless if there are laws in place or not.		This is not only flawed logic, but it's utterly ridiculous.
(3)  I guess people are going to drink and drive anyway, so let's not bother about having laws pertaining to that either.		While we're at it, let's just get rid of our entire legal system.
(2) With that logic, I guess we should get rid of laws about burglary because thieves are going to find a way to break in your house anyway, right?		What about laws that protect people from being killed by drunk drivers?
(1) You hear some gun advocates say, "Well, having stricter gun laws only hurts law-abiding citizens. Criminals will always find a way to get a gun somehow."
In America 2.0, if a church, synagogue or mosque decides to get involved in political matters, they we IMMEDIATELY revoke their tax-exempt status.

@jasonnobleDMR @SenJoniErnst It's not JUST a mental health issue. It's also a GUN FETISHIZATION issue as well. And the fact that some states have RIDICULOUSLY lax gun laws in place. We need universal background checks, tough laws on manufacturers and sellers AS WELL as mental health reform.
In America 2.0, there will be NO MONEY spent on a border wall.
Americans, by nature, don't want to sacrifice anything for the common good, but they are more than willing to tell someone else they should give up their rights &amp; privileges. In order to make progress on gun control (or any other issue), ALL OF US MUST BE WILLING TO MAKE CHANGES!
@alliewen21 Mental illness has definitely been stigmatized in this country and it's not a good thing; however, people, like me, who struggle with anxiety and depression (or any other mental health issues) should not be allowed to own firearms. Period. It's a public safety issue hands down.
In America 2.0, there will NOT be a ban on gun violence research. In fact, we will set aside a specific amount of money that will ONLY be used to properly research gun violence across the country.

@AP_Politics Mitt Romney has ZERO interest in public service. He, like many other Republicans, are only in politics for money and power. He only became governor of Massachusetts so he could run for POTUS. If the people of Utah know what's good for them, they WON'T ELECT HIM!
@Biancadelarosa8 Republicans often fall back on what's referred to as "whataboutism" when defending Trump,  his administration and their vile behavior. It's just a way to deflect from what's really happening likened to dangling a shiny object to divert someone's attention. #NotMyPresident

If you're a Christian, yet you have to claim "religious freedom" because you don't want to bake a cake for a gay couple, you are a hateful person. Discrimination has no place in our society and you will be called out for it!
@MrJeffreyHudson I'm with you 100% on this. Racism, homophobia, xenophobia, misogyny and any other form of hatred, bigotry or discrimination is intolerable!
@MrJeffreyHudson Your story is all too familiar because I was raised similarly. As long as other people were "good" then everything was just fine. Good meant they didn't drink, smoke cigarettes or marijuana, weren't black, Hispanic, Muslim, gay or lesbian, and were obedient to law enforcement.
@FoxNews I have no sympathy for so-called Christians. If you get to pick and choose what you believe in the Bible, discriminate against those who are different than you in order to claim "religious freedom" and mock others for being atheists then you ARE NOT a Christian!

I have decided to take an extended hiatus from this Twitter account and from politics in general because it's taking a toll on my mental health. My hope is that we get back to a more civilized discourse although I remain skeptical. Best wishes to you all!
I'm getting to a point where I'm tired of following politics. It's mentally exhausting and profoundly toxic.
