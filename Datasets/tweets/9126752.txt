Then Panetta asked Gallagher what he thinks of HASC Chairman Adam Smith.  Gallagher: "I think chairman smith is genuinely committed to bipartisan tradition ‚Ä¶ I take him at his word." Stresses Smith's skepticism $750B is the right number and over the entire nuclear triad.
Gallagher ribs Shanahan over his "hashtag masterpiece" budget's $174B in OCO. "That's an order of magnitude change." Contributes to make it "harder to get a bipartisan budget deal done."
"It definitely makes it more complicated," Panetta says of the top line stuff $733B/$700B/$750B. "Needs to be more coordination with the white hose ‚Ä¶ especially when you have the admin making national emergencies that I believe are unfounded."
Interesting answers to @connorobrienNH's Q to Panetta &amp; Gallagher! Will this year's budget gimmickry hurt the Pentagon's credibility on the Hill: Up and down on the top line, that $174B will be in OCO and now the repurposing of MilCon for a border wall, per national emergency.

Debate ends and video cuts as Smith is about to hug opponent. This is one of a bunch of debates, which is pretty amazing. These two disagree on some things, but seem to agree on a lot, and they seem to respect one another.
Asked how he can be trusted to cut DoD budget while taking Boeing campaign contributions, Smith says he votes his district, not contributors. Cites vote against the B-2 and the F-22 that upset Boeing &amp; Northrop Grumman. Would prefer publicly funded, but this is the system now.
Asked if he would work to cut the defense budget, Smith says, "Yes, absolutely." Would take a non-military approach to natsec, seek base closures, cut nuclear weapons spending. "There is vastly too much waste in the defense budget."
Smith touts work on bill w/ Rep. Khanna to invoke war powers to end US mil support to Saudi's Yemen campaign. Saudis "basically executed a journalist they didn't agree with." Adds Trump's comments "have been embarrassing."  Killing journalists is unacceptable. "We care a lot."
This debate is a good reminder that defense, while important to the DC natsec press, is vastly eclipsed by pocketbook issues in the public's consciousness.
^^^ This was in a yes/no lightning round of the debate. Smith was not for impeaching the president without a trial. Bonus from this section: No, Rep. Smith has not smoked marijuana since it was legalized in Washington State, but his 30-year-old democratic socialist opponent has.
Smith: "I believe we should begin impeachment proceedings."
