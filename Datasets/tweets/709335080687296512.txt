FEW WAYS TO SHOW LOVE TO YOUR WIFE
Implement this law that every morning your family will wake up and pray...
Always remember to pray for him.
Appreciate God for the Adam of your life.
Give him a hug for no reason.
Tell him how lucky you are to have him as your husband.
He will not be entice by any other woman that day.
If he is a public figure or politician gently wake him at the early hours of the morning and romance him to the point of demand.
Dial his number and on hearing "hello" just tell him I love you.
Phone and tell him that you miss him.
Put love note in his lunch box or briefcase.
Wash his back while he is in the tub or shower.
Praise him before your children sometimes.
Smile when you look at him and give him occasional pecks when you are out socially.
Give him a warm reception with an embrace when he returns, collect his luggage and help undress him.
Do not allow the maid to serve him food when you are at home. Because u may lose him to them.
Surprise him with his favorite dish especially when he has no enough money at hand and never delay his food.
Insist that he buys gift for his parents and so be sure that he will do same for your parents
Honor his mother
Speak good of him before his Friends and siblings.
Be quick to say " I am sorry dear". When ever you offend him pettingly, insist on his forgiveness, appreciate and kiss him when he does
Be silent when he is angry. You can go back to him in his sober moment with apology n explain why you behave that way that annoyed him.
3. DO not challenge him when he is hurt.
2. Allow him exercise his authority as the head of the family.
1. Discover his favorite pet name and call him by that.

FEW WAYS TO SHOW LOVE TO YOUR HUSBAND
Be thankful to God(your maker) &amp; pray always
Remember that you are too blessed to be stressed
Each night before you go to bed ,Pray to God and Be thankful for what you'll accomplish, today
Envy is a waste of time. You already have all you need
Your job won't take care of you when you are sick. Your friends will. Stay in touch
However good or bad a situation is, it will change
Time heals everything
What other people think of you is none of your business
Help the needy, Be generous ! Be a 'Giver' not a 'Taker'
Frame every so-called disaster with these words: 'In five years, will this matter?'
No one is in charge of your happiness except you
Don't compare your life to others. You have no idea what their journey is all about
Make peace with your past so it won't spoil the present
You don't have to win every argument. Agree to disagree
Don't take yourself so seriously. No one else does
Life is too short to waste time hating anyone. Forgive them for everything !
Life isn't fair, but it's still good.
Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a college kid with a maxed out charge card.
Instead invest your energy in the positive present moment
Don't waste your precious energy on gossip, energy vampires, issues of the past, negative thoughts or things you cannot control.
Try to make at least three people smile each day.
Drink green tea and plenty of water. Eat blueberries, broccoli, and almonds.
Eat more foods that grow on trees and plants and eat less food that is manufactured in plants.
When you wake up in the morning, Pray to ask God's guidance for your purpose, today.
Sit in silence for at least 10 minutes each day.
Take a 10-30 minute walk every day. &amp; while you walk, SMILE. 	It is the ultimate antidepressant
@lanreolusola happy birthday to you and thank you for coming into this genereation
