@JustinHornkohl You don’t have “contracts” between sovereign nations (who would enforce them)?  	In trade negotiations, the MOU is the standard vehicle of a “deal.”

@TheAtlantic 3/3 This was only one drop in the vast briny sea of delusion, self-regard, and fantasy in Trump’s “speech” yesterday.		But: in case you were tempted to believe his claim that China has cleaned up its drug problem — unt-uh. For instance: 	https://t.co/Fgmn8NvdMT
@TheAtlantic 2/2 A finite number of people— hundreds, maybe? of whom I’m one—have worked on remarks for prez's to give in this setting 		Prez + staff actually *plan* these statements. You’ll find *nothing* before resembling the one today, which was like some crank saying “And another thing.." https://t.co/3BmAth5XNP
1/2 I was in transit and didn’t see this “speech.” @TheAtlantic has done something valuable in printing the whole thing, verbatim. 	Yes, I know papers routinely run transcripts, and everyone is familiar with how Trump talks. 	But read from start to end, this one is dumbfounding. https://t.co/BZvyCvBCGW
@jheartney Oh yes indeed. Higher-speed rail is a better alternative in many high-population areas.
7/7 	Final exception proving the rule: the one airline whose culture actually seems stronger than the system as a whole is Southwest. Herb Kelleher’s living memorial.  		/end
6/x	- This is the system 40 years of deregulation, and recent profitability of airlines, have built: 	Very safe; more and more “efficient”; necessary for commerce; cheaper low-end fares opening travel possibilities to a mainstream audience; but … well, you know.
5/x 	-You see these effects in whatever airline you’re flying, but they’re system / industry issues more than company issues. 		You complain most about the company you’re most exposed to, but it’s pretty much the same everywhere.
4/x		-Constant increase in fees; widening Gilded Age gap between “premium” services and crammed-in steerage; steady shrinkage of seats; steady elimination of *slack* in the system—extra planes, extra crew, extra baggage handlers, extra anything—so any delays have ripple effects..
3/x 	-Next point: most of what people don’t like about airline travel seems much more about the industry as a whole than about any one company. 		It’s the modern airline business, more than any specific line.
2/x	-But in past few months, have had a lot of exposure to all airlines, through routing to places main carrier doesn’t go.		-First thing to be said: US  carriers are amazingly *safe*. Requires hard work, and shouldn’t be taken for granted. Also continued progress on fuel-effic.
1/x 	A brief theory of airlines, from aboard another delayed flight:		-Have done 75% of my overall flying w one airline, because of decades of long-hauls to China, Japan, Australia, plus IAD to SFO, SEA, or LAX.	 	Resulting status-lock-in steers me in their direction.
@painter_nancy @jorge_guajardo @AmericanAir To be more precise: I think it’s unfair for people who have any kind of in-public role, including journalists, to use that as leverage for consumer complaints. 	Also: no one’s travel issues are interesting to anyone else. 	Also: it’s against Atlantic policy to do so.
@jorge_guajardo @AmericanAir I will tell you about this in person, Jorge, since It Is Wrong to use social media for “in public” customer complaints…		But I now know what you’ve been talking about!
@mcmansionhell And, my ‘China Airborne’ tries to tell a lot of the Western history of commercial aviation, as backdrop for China’s hopes/plans/frustrations.
@mcmansionhell Sam Verhovek’s 'Jet Age' is about one particular era — the US/UK struggle to become the leading commercial-jet producer post WWII — but it’s a good book and has lots of background and also foreshadowing.
@mattyglesias Obviously this is inserted query/emphasis for items in a series.	 I’m imagining other *series* read in this rising-tone ?? way:		 -Gov of the people?? By the people?? For the people?? 	-We shall fight on the beaches?? We shall fight in the fields?? In the hills??		Try it!
2/2 Other obvious item on this list: 1976  (Ford chall by Reagan, Carter wins). h/t @DKarol		Point is of course correlation rather than causation. An incumbent weak/ troubled enough to invite major challenge within his own party likely headed for trouble in general election too.
@DKarol Yes!
It’s a very small data set, + not clear whether Weld will actually run. But: in past 50 years, incumb w serious primary challenge=&gt;his party loses.	-1968 (LBJ challenged by McCarthy+RFK. Nixon wins)	-1980 (Carter chall by EMK. Reagan wins)	-1992 (GHWB chall by Buchanan, WJC wins)

5/5 Here is the part of CNN session where Howard Schultz says that running in all 50 states is what will allow him to overcome the “no independent candidate has carried even a single  state since 1968” historical pattern.		https://t.co/mclxIWim7Y
4/4 When you find the transcript, judge for yourself. Schultz says he is “weighing the math” of a campaign.  	This fundamental math point—zero EVs for 3rd party candidates since 1968—will presumably be one they return to.  /end
3/x His answer then, and last night to CNN, was: It will all be different with a 50-state campaign; the two established parties have 40+ states already locked up and just compete in a few. 	He says he would open up the playing field, in time of discontent etc.
2/x First Q I asked:	-Most recent non-established-party candidate to *win* election was A Lincoln,1860	-Most recent to get *even one* electoral vote was G Wallace, 1968. 	-Perot, Nader, etc didn’t carry a single state.	-What would be different now?
1/x Don’t yet see full transcript of CNN Town Hall w Howard Schultz https://t.co/dmdjcLqSLz , but his answers consistent w what I heard when interviewing him last week at Boston session. Notably including: electability / “spoiler” role.

Lessons of Amtrak, of which I’m big fan: 	Unlike airlines, travel exper inversely related to price.	-1st class Acela noisy (half the pax doing biz on cell phones), more of seating across tables than in ‘normal’ cars.	-Normal Acela very nice	-Regional about as nice, *way* cheaper
@thesarahrose @yeselson @AdamSerwer Maybe some, but not much. I am from that generation. Little tape recorders — first with tiny cassettes, now digital—have been cheap for many decades now.

If you had to choose between the delivery of Trump’s speech, and the writing, I think you’d choose the delivery,.
@MrWalterShapiro I think it’s close. Ending time was on a par with Clinton’s longest, but not sure about start time.
“The tallest summit” is worth reflecting on, in itself, as a phrase someone came up with.
Based on what’s left in prepared text, this one is likely to surpass Clinton for longest-ever televised SOTU.		We’ll see.
This is a formal, written speech - not an improv rally riff.
@chrislhayes Way, way, way far from the most attention-getting composition point in this speech.
Now, that was *the* strangest transition I have ever heard.		"And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of God. The final part of my agenda is to protect America’s National Security."
This is true.		Part of kabuki of SOTUs is the double intro: Once by the doorkeeper of the House, and then again by the Speaker, who always (except 2019) says:		" I have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States.” Not this time https://t.co/zOsoARuBxm

2/3 As a refresher, re excellent pt by @erikbryn, summary of top *marginal* US tax rates. Main pattern:	-Rates *very* high (80%-90%) from late Depression through WWII and *all* of 1950s;	-Reduced from ~90% to ~70% by JFK cut of 1960s	-Stayed 70% till Reagan 1982. 	-Now 37% https://t.co/KTyxJV61Uo

8/ Getting the word “beheading” into a speech is its own form of dog whistle.
7/ Whoever is the Trump “speechwriter” just came up with the “they don’t hate the people on the outside, they love the people on the inside” trope.
6/  I mentioned yesterday that this venue — in the Oval Office, reading from a prompter, having no crowd to feed and draw strength from — was not his forte.		This is the one Trump prediction in which I’ve been right.
5/ ??? “At the request of the Democrats, I am advocating a steel barrier”??

@_mike_schilling It’s still safer than most other ways you could spend your time. But any added risk is wholly unnecessary and politics-induced (by McConnell and Trump).

@MainStreetMuse @Zathras3 @FallowsDeb Again, I’m making a different point.
@Zathras3 @FallowsDeb 2/2 Immig/crime are egs: In areas where immigs have actually arrived, very little “fear.” Main fear-rhetoric in districts like Steve King’s. In most places. crime is down, fear of crime is up. 	Real polling data shows gap in sense of agency/victimhood of national-vs-local issues
@Zathras3 @FallowsDeb 1/2 	W/ respect, I think you’re slightly misreading the point. It’s not that the tone is “restricted to Washington." It’s the difference between how *national issues outside direct experience* are discussed — eg “the caravan” on talk radio — and how real life is lived.
Agree with this argument.		Also consistent w theme I’ve been pushing since ‘American Carnage’ speech: gap between the furious/“victim” tone of much national-level discourse, and the engaged, practical, let’s-figure-it-out tenor of much local- and regional-level American life. https://t.co/Cq01XmUjjj

@jonathanchait It seems to me that the whole letter is about the differences. (I say that based on never having met Trump but having talked with Mattis starting 30 years ago.)
Worth reading. This is not a “retirement,” as Trump ignorantly put it. (Mattis “retired” from USMC yrs ago; people don’t “retire” from the Cabinet; he is 4 yrs younger than Trump.)		It’s a resignation on differences of policy and principle. Which no doubt have been accumulating. https://t.co/1UEuX042ka

Fascinating to watch Stephen Miller on @FaceTheNation just now. In first half of intvw had clearly been coached toward smoother demeanor. (Re 7-yr-old death, “Our hearts break” etc) 	 Then, second half, subj turns to “the Wall,” and old Miller is back. Talking over M Brennan etc

@stuartpstevens @FallowsDeb 5/5 Iran-Contra another. 	But no one judges histor figures *only* on their worst choices. View GHWB in the whole—his countless forms of service, his handling of China/post-USSR, the team he attracted, his bearing as a person, his dissent from no-tax orthodoxy— and mourn his loss
@stuartpstevens @FallowsDeb 4/5 To round this out: even more than the rest of us, public figures need to be assessed “overall,” since even the noblest have their expedient and dark moments. FDR did. Lincoln and Jefferson did. 	For GHWB, in my book Clarence Thomas was lowest point, along w Willie Horton.
@stuartpstevens 3/3 And to spell this out: I’m sure part of motive in book by @FallowsDeb and me is to share examples of people otherwise known only in their communities,  who are living for larger civic causes.
@hilde45 @stuartpstevens Agree about Atwater and 1988.
@JohnR925 @stuartpstevens There are very few absolute cases, individuals or societies that are purely good or purely evil. As noted, I opposed most of GHWB’s political choices. But important to recognize his many, many personal and civic virtues.
@stuartpstevens 2/2 So many men and women of our parents’ generation, famous (like Bush) or unknown outside their own families/ communities (like most people), set such powerful daily examples. To me, passing of GHWB mainly occasion for thinking about new sources of such examples.   RIP
1/2 Yes, wonderful piece by @stuartpstevens. Stuart says that GHWB, whom he supported politically, reminded him of character of his own dad. From same generation as SPS but diff polit outlook, I too saw my dad’s bearing/ humor / modesty / energy when I watched GHWB. https://t.co/iFAF7iE1DP

@WendellAlbright Right, but reinforces my point, which is about SPOKEN emphasis.		None of those places *says* “THE George Washington Univ.”   They say “GW,” or “Stanford,” or “AU.”  I live 1 mile from AU and have never heard “THE American University.” (For the one  in the US.)
@JJ_Emerson That happened about 30 years ago.  I think it’s an extension from previous names: “the Harbor Freeway,” “the San Diego Freeway,” “the Golden State” etc.  The “the” carried over, w shift to numbers.	Still sounds odd to me. I-10 through my home town was “the San Bernardino Fwy"

@jientho The real argument was about early 2013: when Obama had just been re-elected, when the Dems held the Senate, and when she turned 80.		At this point, it is a tontine-style contest between her tenure on the bench and Trump’s in office.

This is exactly the opposite of what occurred:	-Obama criticized likely effects of ‘Citizens United’ in his Jan 2010 SOTU speech;	-Alito, part of Cit-U majority, mouthed “Not true” from the crowd.

1/2 Yes. The fundamental speechwriting skill is writing in the voice of the speaker — writing it the way the Prez (etc) would have done, if he’d had the time.

I am not a lawyer™, but I once worked in a presidential transition.		The idea that any power of an incumbent prez, including exec privilege, applies during a transition, is absurd.

@ChuckLane1 @jbarro Chuck, point is, these decisions come up with *every* president.

@jbarro You’ll notice that people w past White House experience (Frum, Rhodes, Vietor, etc, and me) are all saying that the bad-weather excuse doesn’t pass the plausibility test. There would always be a Plan B.
Confirming from earlier era: went on a bunch of these trips w J. Carter in the 1970s. 		Even back then, always a rain / snow / protest / etc set of backup plans.

In the last weeks of his life, nearly 30 years ago, the ruthless GOP operative Lee Atwater made a confession that, if true, casts subsequent political history in a different light. What he said has remained private until now.  		(Story by me.) https://t.co/IQ39XRLC9U

10/10 And I tell myself I am making this anti-bloodline case strictly on merits + American history—and in no way affected by realization that my “bloodline,” Scottish + German + English, is identical to the man pursuing this whole retrograde them. 	More family story.	Less DNA. /x
9/x	 It would be great to hope that family-story is the ongoing theme she stresses, as opposed to the DNA patterns. 	That is because family story, and struggle, is the great message of American possibility, and anything involving DNA or bloodline is usually the reverse.
8/x	- Again, I undrstnd that she is 100% responding to Trump’s odious attack on bloodline theme, as Obama ultimately responded to T’s odious claims on birtherism 	-But the real “American exceptionalism” she should want to claim is her family’s own sense of itself, its lived story
7/x … In the American context, there’s almost never a discussion of someone’s “real” background, or “bloodline” [Trump may have used that word, don’t think Warren did, though it’s by definition subject of DNA tests], that can lead anywhere positive, or has ever done so.
6/x So what’s the “However….” ? 		For me, it’s queasiness on the DNA test. On the one hand, entirely understandable why she decided to do the test and talk about results, given that Trump has challenged her specifically on this point. 		But …
5/x Can contrast that w Obama and birtherism: he was so (rightly) contemptuous of the thinly veiled racism of the claim that for a long time he thought it beneath him to take it seriously.  		So Warren shows a tough, and competent, willingness to engage.
4/x That is, long slew of law profs saying on-camera what Boston Globe investig also found: claim of Native Am background had zero effect on her appointments or professional rise. 		Won’t convince birther-counterparts, but probably sensible to shove this right back against Trump.
3/x 	-So, in trying to position her story the way she wants it told—tough daughter of the working class, not some pinko from Cambridge—very skillfully done.		-Now, the “bloodline” question. She obviously didn’t start this (Trump did), and argument impeccable on the merits.
2/x 	-Like others in the genre, from Parson Weems to ‘A Place Called Hope’ (WJC), its official msg is the way the lived reality of early days shaped values.	(Underappreciated gem in this category: Jimmy Carter’s campaign version of origin story. https://t.co/wU8BhEWJeB )

@paul_kramarchyk @MaxBoot This is a point I have dealt with at some length, eg: https://t.co/cz2xGlWVuv
1) I disagreed 100% with @MaxBoot about the Iraq war, and its run-up, and its aftermath.		2) I very much respect the case he has been making for the past few years, and I was happy to do a blurb recommending his (well-written, illuminating) latest book. https://t.co/uCPlal63Qq

@Rosenthaltweets @nadinecarroll New angle!
@nadinecarroll No situations are ever “exactly” the same. (And what about D Ginsburg?) 		Two cases of filling a vacancy, in election year, when Senate controlled by other party.  McConnell is making up this “tradition.”
2/2	- In 1956, Eisenhower (R) was prez, Dems controlled Senate. Ike gave recess appointment to Brennan *three weeks* before election. (Imagine if Obama had, w Garland.)  Brennan confirmed following year, but “vacancy was filled” in prez election year. Notwithstanding “tradition"
1/2 Revisiting tradition:		- In 1988, Reagan (R) was prez, Dems controlled Senate. In Feb 1988 Dem-majority Senate confirmed Kennedy  *unanimously.* (Was nominated previous November, but confirmed during election year.) https://t.co/SIx1GlIZ6Q

@ResCon1 Incorrect. After first hearings, before Ford charges, Leahy, Feinstein, and other Sens said flat-out that he had, umm, not told the truth about his record in Bush admin. 	By several reports, McConnell himself had reccd that Trump not choose him, because of confirm difficulties

@dvlnd3 Why would McConnell need cover? Again, THE GARLAND CASE.
Agree w Norm:	-McConnell was blocking ALL nominees, much as he later did w Garland (and as Dems had never done);	-Reid changed it for *non* Scotus noms;	-McConnell has extended to Scotus.

-Trump got 46% of popular vote.	-51 pro-Kav votes in Senate represent about 46% of US electorate.		Complex Constitutional checks and balances meant to protect minority *rights.*		Democracies cannot function if they lock in long-term minority *rule.*		https://t.co/onsJV84klg
Re-upping: “swing” vote on court now w man opposed by 2400 law profs + former dean of his law school + former Scotus justice; demonstrably misled Senate under oath; took “goes around comes around” partisan stand. This will change how court is viewed.	 	https://t.co/onsJV84klg
Roberts remembered for “just call balls and strikes” pose in hearings.		Reportedly has real concern about ongoing legit of Court (reasons for which just went up 100-fold).		Has no good option here, but this stance will increase sense that SCOTUS is US Senate, with longer terms. https://t.co/V6D2otcx8K

@KBAndersen The figures I’ve been using are 10:1 in the original days (Virginia:Delaware) vs 70:1 now (Calif:Wyoming). 		Of course *counting of slaves* a crucial factor in the early large/small state issues. And on general point of course 100% agree.

@Truth_Quest30 @jeniferfenton @AdamSerwer Incorrect — starting with the 20 million estimate. (*Most* generous guesstimate is closer to 12 million.)		You’re forgetting Texas and Arizona, each w two GOP Senators, and Florida w one.  Also the whole Plains region and most of the Midwest, with substantial populations.
@AdamSerwer Also, the 51 pro-Kavanaugh Senate votes represent together about 15 million fewer constituents than the 49 anti votes. 	I understand how the Senate works, but this underscores your point.

@Head_sherpa The reason for 18 is to work out the stagger — 9 justices, appointment every 2 years.	 Plan B: 9 year terms, new appointment every year.  But that would let a 2 term prez *totally* remake court (8 of 9), which is probably too volatile.

No one can offer any defensible reason why there needs to be a vote on Kavanaugh *now*, for a lifetime omni-powerful no-recourse job, before hearing all evidence.		In crassest terms, whatever happens in midterms, GOP will control Senate till end of this year. What *is* the rush?
@jbarro It’s simpler: How do you RUSH to a vote on this person, for a lifetime job (with zero effective accountability), before looking further into the story. 		Cf: Clarence Thomas.

@SalterWobchak @ezraklein Just don’t know; my point is that for a statement *intended* to be hard to trace, I’m skeptical of linguistic parsing shedding much light.
1) Sen. Feinstein is no one’s idea of a leftie (just ask Calif Dems) or one to rush toward hasty conclusions.	2) She is pointing toward evid of apparent flat-out lies by Kavanaugh	3) Of modern Scotus hearings, only other where *lying* was alleged (vs dissembling) was C.

@SalterWobchak @ezraklein Maybe.	But I bet you I (or any experienced speech/op-ed writer) could write a document that would parse as being “from” Trump — or McCain, or HRC, or Obama etc. 	Just as actors can convincingly do various accents, people experienced in this kind of writing can shift registers.
@ezraklein FWIW and from experience in this kind of political/public rhetoric, anyone putting this together would have anticipated “forensic analysis” and written around it, including in intentionally misleading ways.		Comparable to distorting your voice when making a secret-tip phone call.

3/3 Just to close the loop, the 11am ET NPR live update, in contrast to the 10am one, used the word “unprecedented” (vs “unusual”) and described the substance of the Brennan / intel-chief critique of Trump (vs “feud”).
@mrkat07 “Unprecedented”		Even just “criticism” would imply an argument / critique, vs just “feud”
@2bigdoghouse Deliberately didn’t say that, for high-falutin’-avoidance purposes.
2/2 So as not to be pointlessly cryptic here:		-“Unusual” is an awkward description for something with no remote precedent in our history;		-“Feud” is a minimizing term for the case Brennan (and now intel chiefs + McRaven) are making about Trump.
NPR hourly newscast just said it was “unusual” for dozen former intel leaders to support John Brennan in his “feud” with Trump.		Hear for yourself: https://t.co/4JUQ4cgi7N

@G0snar @GrahamDavidA Fair point.
@MonitorBroke @GrahamDavidA We disagree.
@MonitorBroke @jrothfeder @GrahamDavidA 1) That’s not the argument Trump is making.		2) On balance, not at all clear that peeling the AF away from the Army was a military sensible idea. (Cf: the long sage of the A-10.) If that’s the precedent, caution is all the more called for.
@MonitorBroke @jrothfeder @GrahamDavidA I think that is the point that David Graham, I, and others have been making. This is pure theatrics, since the AF Space Command already exists.
@MonitorBroke @jrothfeder @GrahamDavidA Right, which intensifies the case against it.
This is a very good assessment (of a very bad idea), by @GrahamDavidA https://t.co/HV4lfK0Csw
@hof1991 Yes, I listen to audio books a lot. (The whole of Theodore Dreiser! Now, ‘Portrait of a Lady’ by H James.)

@Kadzis @dylanmatt On this front (Huntington / South Africa):	- In 1960s, he argued (incorrectly) that SA regime was more stable than it seemed;	- In 1980s, he argued that SA needed a federalized, balance-of-power constitution (vs strict democ).  V interesting analysis here https://t.co/LqnjAXudOx
@dylanmatt @Kadzis Right, but Krauthammer (like me) was in his 20s, a long road with many changes ahead of him. (He was working for Mondale, I believe). Huntington was in his 50s, a much more formed figure.
@Kadzis @dylanmatt When I got to know Sam Huntington best was (wait for it …. ) during Jimmy Carter’s administration, when he was a nat-security advisor to Carter and I worked with him on some speeches.	  FOR JIMMY CARTER.
@dylanmatt Right, in college eons ago I too read many of Huntington’s works and went to many of his lectures. Had to have been a lot of other factors that led Kobach down the path he has followed. (Ie, 1000x as many people have read H’s books as hold K’s views.)

@knittingdan @vestal13 well done.

In his first minutes on air after the “dumbest man on TV” tweet, @donlemon absolutely spitting fire (with cool, controlled, icy-deadly-earnest deliberation). 	Do not miss when a clip goes up.
@richardsona Right, wasn’t comparing it against that.
3/3 	Factual footnote: some Calif water *is* going straight to sea, via streams, for protecting-endangered-species (fish) reasons. That is controversial with some, especially Central Valley farmers. But zero connection to fires or fire-fighting. /end/
2/3 Problem is that conventions of journalism make people shy from saying, “THIS IS FALSE,” vs “it differs from what experts say.” It’s a genuine problem for this era’s journalism, and this case illustrates it.
1/2 Good story by AP, but it illustrates an ongoing problem.	It’s not simply that Trump's claim differs from “what state experts say.”	It differs from plain, uncontested, easily observable, couldn’t-be-otherwise truth. It’s birther-scale invented fantasy. https://t.co/8242Bod6FP

2/2 To put it in NYC-centric terms, it’s like saying: “How can there be any illiteracy in New York, when the publishing houses there are putting out so many books each year?” Or “How can anyone be poor in New York, with all those banks?” 	[latter is actually good Q]
1/2 You don’t have to be from California, or know anything about the state (or its climate or water history), to guess that this is a detached-from-reality response to past-decade’s drought and recent disastrous fires.	But trust me, that is what it is…. https://t.co/JVfoodFzfG

@jayry45 I think this is more a Central Valley type of response (Nunes). SoCal people (like Miller) generally not involved in this aspect of Calif water politics.
The callousness of this statement is rivaled only by its ignorance.

@ReliableSources @Scaramucci 3/3 And obviously there is a particular, purposeful edge to the string of recent “dumb” / “low IQ” attacks on prominent black figures. 	But in literal terms, @Scaramucci’s point is (depressingly) correct. /end
@ReliableSources @Scaramucci 2/2 And indeed, there are more “stupid” comments about whites than I would have expected:	- DeNiro is “low IQ”	- G Steph is “stupid”	- Mika B is “dumb as a rock” 	- Clapper is “world’s dumbest” 	etc	- CNN reporter is “idiot"	Just for the record. https://t.co/LEiwQKPZo7
1/2 Minor fact-check point in DJT’s favor (sort of):	- On @ReliableSources just now, @Scaramucci said of “dumb” comments re Don Lemon, Rep. Waters, LeB James: “it’s not racist, he calls everyone stupid.”	Searchable archive of DJT tweets is here: https://t.co/LEiwQKPZo7

Private citiz; orig hired by Trump's GOP opponents; took Russ info to FBI	https://t.co/pwJUnZNEIY https://t.co/4uoGKdYqZV
@pmcall Because the circumstances are *entirely* different. Steele was originally hired by Trump’s GOP opponents, in the primary. And when he got info about Russian involvement, he went straight to the FBI.
4/4 As several people have pointed out, Reagan campaign in 1980 was at least tacitly, and perhaps actively, in sync w Ayatollah’s Iran about delaying hostage release, to weaken Carter. 	But these 2 exceptions—VN 1968, Iran 1980 — show how *abnormal* the foreign involvement is.
@danablankenhorn Good point, though I think less direct evidence in that case.
3/3	- And, of course, what Trump team has said about meeting until just now is at total odds with current claim. 	/end
2/x 	-Closest gray-zone comparison is Nixon team’s backstage dealings w South Vietnam during 1968 campaign, to undermine ongoing peace talks and and boost Nixon chances over Humphrey.	LBJ knew/suspected this and considered it treason by Nixon.  https://t.co/wmv3HYJINc
1/x	If it matters, claim below is false on many levels. 	- I worked directly w the (successful) candidate in one prez race, reported on a bunch of others.

@FallowsDeb @Noahpinion 8/x He stresses importance of something I’d scoffed at before these travels (and many big-city-based pundits still do): that “public-private partnerships” are a real thing, not just K-Street slogan for sweetheart projects.

@FallowsDeb 6/x This is prelude to saying that now there is a national level print/online outlet that has engaged exactly the points we *hoped* would come across, and moved them forward in what I consider an important way.
@FallowsDeb 5/x National-level *broadcast* (TV + radio) and podcast attention also has done much more than we expected to engage with actual argument, so thanks for that too. 	Eg https://t.co/pZjDONaLoF or https://t.co/vGBnIXwTW3

3/x Response @FallowsDeb and I have gotten from two sources (re ’Our Towns’) has been highly heartening on the “getting it” front. 	One source: actual readers across the country. Thanks! Will try to answer, eventually.
2/x Thus response that *gets* what you are trying to say, as opposed to just being “positive" (though that’s always a plus), can’t be relied on or foreseen, but always most welcome when it occurs.
1/x Reason to write a book always needs to be internal: there is something you feel you *have* to try to say. No way to predict/control response, so can’t tie your satisfaction to that. It has to be in the doing, itself. 	(Outweighing inevitable neuralgia of the writing process.)

@_mike_schilling @TheAtlantic Yeah, we go into all of this — Fresno’s role in popular culture and self-image within California. 	Meta theme: whole concept of being ‘forgotten,’  or not, plays negative role some places and positive motivating one elsewhere. A whole chapter on it!

@limitedinc3 Good point, if that had been something I had claimed. 	Q is reaction to “majority minority,” which is generally calm. 	(And many polls show generally non-panicked US reaction to immig and related ethnic shifts.)

B Clinton’s “depends what the meaning of is, is” or J Kerry’s “voted for it, before I voted against it” were (for real) serious attempts to explain a complicated point—and nonetheless became standing jokes.		“I said ‘would’ but, oops, I meant ‘wouldn’t’ ” is just … arrgh. https://t.co/M6AhWAV6sS

@amandaripley 5/5 That flattening more legit w Trump than some other candids, as TNC argued https://t.co/OUy1BYc8RI , because his views and resentments are so stark and flattened too. But *assuming* “Red state” views fully match his makes such flattening/polarization more likely. /end
@amandaripley 4/5 Of course elections finally *are* flattened, one-or-the-other choices. But because that choice is so interesting to reporters—and so *important*—our instincts are reduce rest of life to that flatness. Eg: “this town went for Trump, so people there must also think….”
@amandaripley 3/4 US is not quite as wildly contradictory as China, but political / cultural trends 1000x more complicated than main media/politics instincts of the moment allow for. As soon as reporters ask “do you still like Trump?” discussion is reduced to flattened, 0-or-1 grid. https://t.co/1HD7mECpmD
@amandaripley 2/3 When we were reporting from China, US audiences seemed comfortable w the point of ongoing, fundamental contradiction. Everything you could say about China—good and bad, uplifting and horrific, hyper-modern and very outdated—was true, *someplace* in the country.

@GO_GeneK @danmoulthrop @JDVance1 Yes, we spent most of the past five years looking into exactly this, in smaller towns (and a few larger ones, including the largest-of-all, Columbus OH).
@GO_GeneK @danmoulthrop @JDVance1 There are 5000 small airports in the United States.  Virtually every city is within reasonable drive of one.	 If you read our book, you’ll see that we talk about cities that are indeed too small to find a way forward.
@GO_GeneK @danmoulthrop @JDVance1 Spent two weeks each in Dodge City KS. In Sioux Falls SD. In Fresno CA.  In Columbus MS. This was not an in-and-out operation.
@mattsteinglass Thanks. 100% agree (as you would guess: https://t.co/FKB2ISWog7 )   Meta-point: big struggle for the future of the country, between the bleakness/dysfunction at national level and the ongoing renewal at local level.

@LarryMishel @yeselson Post-union wages lower in almost every industry than in union era. Autos, steel, etc. That was much of the *point* of anti-union drive.	1) Should unions be stronger? Yes.	2) What is the real situation at the moment? I believe it’s what I described here: https://t.co/HbNWyefbLo
@yeselson @LarryMishel Agree that busting the unions was a crucial part of the process.	 I’m saying that in the situation as of 2018, great majority of slaughterhouses are in places where even “attractive” wages and benefits aren’t in fact attracting people from WV, PA, IN, KY, etc.
@mjfuhlhage Yes, agree.
3) But the plain reality we heard *from workers*, from managers, from community members in KS and SD is that there is no substantial supply of people willing to move from KY, WV, OH, MI, IN etc to work in far-west slaughterhouses. /end
2) You can say “good riddance,” you can say “I’d happily pay twice as much for meat,” you can say “better to import it from Mexico,” or whatever. You can say that a revived labor movement (which I’m for) could shift the balance.
1) In our book we describe huge packing-houses in Dodge City + environs, and their argument that wages high enough to attract native-born workers to *MOVE TO WESTERN KS* and spend all day killing/ carving up animals are simply incompatible w anything like current US meat industry https://t.co/BpAUJx3Vbw

@_JohnTierney_ Hi John, not sure exactly what you’re saying here. FWIW Duluth went for HRC nearly 2:1 over Trump (59%-30%). Surrounding St Louis County went 52%-40% for HRC. Local Dem Congressman carried area by 2-to-1 margin. People will show up, but this is not “Trump country.”
Genuinely puzzling. *Nothing* in front-page layout hints at realities that “border crisis” was 100% result of Trump policy decision, nor that he, DHS Sec, and press spox have flat-out lied (until a few minutes ago) about “Congress alone” having responsibility to stop this abuse. https://t.co/vSYZjz0jFm

2/2 Of the 125,000+ words in ‘Our Towns,’ exactly two are “infest.” One refers to roaches that ate up a school’s garden; another, to an invasive plant now choking the surface of Caddo Lake, TX-LA.  		Applying it to people is an undeniable tell, like “shiftless.”

My dad, who died ten years ago, was a Navy doctor during the Korean War.		*His* parents—the generation Trump is talking about—were born around 1900, and were not around during the 2016 campaign. https://t.co/38XAizC2I2

A point nearly all reporters know in principle but is hard to remember in real time (especially on-camera):	 If you ask several Qs, the pol/spox will ALWAYS take the easy one. And likely won’t ever get to  hardest one.	If you’ve got a hard Q, ask *only that one.* https://t.co/WfQpM1Yetl
@tonywalker1 Thanks so much! Hope you enjoy it.
@BradSmi @FallowsDeb Thank you very much.		Completely agree about skills and expanded broadband.
Really appreciate attention and support from @BradSmi		Agree 100% that expanding access to high-speed connex is of first-tier importance. In big cities, where you’re grumpy if coffee house wifi has complex log-on, hard to imagine how many people rely on, eg, pub library internet https://t.co/U54cX1UqQA
@Palmo53 -No evidence missiles have been removed (vs hidden/relocated)	-No reason to think CN would do this (at odds with all their other actions)	-Photos from *before* NK meeting in any case	-Nothing else in CN behavior matches supposed “win” pattern
Worth noting, in the constructing-an-atlernative-reality category.		This is not true, but will become “true” enough to serve as self-reassuring talking point for admin’s supporters. https://t.co/FIpHZ6WNM7

Reality test for preposterous claim by Trump aide:	Obama oversaw international deal that imposed 100x the conditions on Iran that Trump has w NK. 		Trump got literally zero specific concession.

Correct. Also; Corker announced in Feb that he wouldn’t run again. Unlike Fulbright, who lost in 1974, or Lodge, who died in office, Corker has literally zero electoral risk to worry about. Why won’t he,  or Flake, or Hatch take a stand?  Or “thoughtful” Sasse/“moderate” Collins? https://t.co/Uxu4dmgbh1
@Noahpinion I think the sane version of the post-Deng argument was always:	- CN would slowly become less rather than more repressive (which it did, until ~2016)	- It would become more rather than less tied-in to world order in various ways.		https://t.co/6WYx6K7BgY
One more in “I agree with this interp of the meeting” vein, from the venerable IISS. https://t.co/EfasfnErjj		Short version: the US ends up w no more than in previous NK deals; much less than in Iran nuke deal; while giving huge direct boost to KJU and indirect boost to China. https://t.co/hRUMdvr6pd
I agree with this interp, too. https://t.co/klUug2itUy

In Jan, I did a piece pointing out that if only two GOP Sens would move from “concerned” laments to actually *voting* to rein in Trump’s excesses, they could stop some of the carnage they complain about. 	Sens Collins, Flake, Corker, etc: It’s still true.	https://t.co/Oew8yDCqdV
@LuxeChronicles @dangillmor Look, my family got kicked out of that part of the world for things we wrote (in this case, what my wife wrote). I’m familiar with receiving end of censorship there. 	If you see no distinction between Singapore and Marcos-Phils, Suharto-Indonesia, etc, OK. To me they differ
At least three times as many Americans work in solar power (and, until now, growing fast) as in coal mining.		https://t.co/sGtgu2FVtP https://t.co/qxGQ9aRTqH
@LuxeChronicles @dangillmor It’s a place I’m very familiar with, from mid-1980s onward. It’s the distinction I use. YMMV.
@dangillmor I’d always used the term “authoritarian,” which I think distinguishes Singapore in the LKY era onward from, eg, Indonesia or the Philippines in their actual-dictatorial eras.
This resembles what we have seen elsewhere. Again the contrast between scorched-earth national-level rhetoric and local-level realities. https://t.co/Bdh5Ke8Us9

Another implied assumption: that except for permanent trade relats w China, US would have stood up for Uighurs. 	 But that die was cast (inter alia) when GWBush bought the Chinese argument that Xinjiang was another front in the Global War on Terror, w Uighurs as the enemy. https://t.co/hJmHZOQEFn

Just back from 2 weeks in Europe / UK (plus seeing lots of Canadians), I can attest: deeper and more genuine outrage--about the tariffs, the G-7 blow-up, the courtliness toward Russia and NK while stiffing historic allies—than may have sunk in to most observers in the US. https://t.co/dW2NCsm1hC

1/2 Lesson of 2 weeks in UK/Eur: 	- Americans who don’t like Trump’s tariffs and impulse-excesses can say, “Oh, that’s Trump…”	- For Euros/Canadians/Mexicans, it’s *the US government* that is slapping on tariffs, declaring them nat-security threats, applying secondary sanctions.
@DerekKrissoff @FallowsDeb Thanks. I’m all-in for public efforts when and where they are feasible (in current circumstances). Amazing how much of today’s public infrastructure is there thanks to the WPA in just a few years.

@sexposparenting Right, ten-fold+ increase in 30+ years is believable.		In one year, it is not.
@sexposparenting Agree with all of that!  Not denying basic thesis (which is true, and which I’ve seen).
@joshgerstein I think they must have meant 30% per year, which is impressive enough on its own.
@sexposparenting Thirty percent a month would mean approx 2000% increase in a year.  Are properties in MLB *twenty times* more expensive than a year ago? (A $100k property going for $2 million?) That’s what would surprise me.
@robstrong I suppose, but the sentence is specifically about “home buyers”
Chinese flight-capital property investment in Calif, Canada, Australia, etc is a real thing.	But somehow I doubt that this stat in WSJ is correct. 	(By miracle of compounding, "30% a month" =&gt; prices going up astronomically in a year.) 	https://t.co/hs2yaj6e7x
