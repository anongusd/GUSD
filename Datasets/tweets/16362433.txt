@nytimeskristof Go for it and don't cover your mouth/nose.
@ingridmusic Sorry 2 hear that.  Hope things (and life) lightens up for u.
@someecards Very important that u do that.  Need to know. More bills that serve the people will become law. That's a GOOD thing. :)
@ben_stiller Mmmmm, sounds 2 good. But sure it could get better. U could be in the Mediterranean eating ur banana bread french toast.
@Atrios Yeah, but it's better than 59.
@Atrios I know, that sux.  But the arlen specter news sounds hopeful 4 the dems.  Watching david schuster so that doesn't suck.
@courtneyatmsnbc Wooooooo.  Would b great as long as the blue dogs don't blow it 4 the dems policies that need 2 b pushed thru
@SamSeder Someday that uneven cut will be in style. She's a step or 2 ahead in the fashion world. She's 2 cute.
@JSi5 That sux if u ask me.
