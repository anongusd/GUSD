Democrats are not allowed to be centrists anymore. https://t.co/fsiCpaZLAz
@MatthewAryCEO @nowthisnews She insulted to the extent where he was almost in tears. You can tell he was deeply offended. Chairman Cummings, a *Democrat*, defended Meadows. Tlaib's apology after was not an apology, and she didn't own up to her mistake.
@MatthewAryCEO @nowthisnews This argument is ridiculous. Congressman Meadows did not attack anyone's personal character. His behavior was not against committee rules. Congresswoman Tlaib, however, *did* attack someone personally. She didn't say names, but we all know very well who she was referring to.

alive human being https://t.co/PEI0myXLDS
@stevenarwhals no. I brought up those two because I was showing you real examples of racism. you can choose to call Meadows a racist person based on that little comment but I won't be so quick to judge.
@stevenarwhals no I'm seeing if you tolerate racism "sometimes"
@stevenarwhals is Ralph Northam in the right for putting a KKK photo in his med school yearbook? Or Ilhan Omar for being blatantly anti-semitic?
@stevenarwhals he was fired up to the crowd about winning an election. it's not like he was going around trying to prove that Obama was born out of the country
@stevenarwhals I don't think he was trying to spread a conspiracy theory
@stevenarwhals Believe that makes him racist if you want to, I'll be looking at his character and when someone gets that angry when called a racist, I don't believe they are one.
Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows are perfect for oversight hearings.
@stevenarwhals Please show me racist attitudes and actions of Mark Meadows.
congrats AOC, you weren't the craziest at the hearing
@stevenarwhals He is not a racist, if you could handle the truth you would see that. Your Democrat Elijah Cummins just said he wasn't racist.

@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction it's deserving of a chance at life because it has a heartbeat. it has tastes and motions. it has every body part that a human child has. 		this argument can go on forever. I'm going bed, goodnight and thank you for at least being respectful.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction I don't think animals should be tested inhumanely.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction I never implied anything. And no because that is cannibalism and I just hope you don't think that's ok.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction I never said they don't go to waste.		I also never said they aren't helpful. However, we can't purposely take a life away just to study something.		I am not flip flopping, there are just multiple reasons why it's wrong.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction exactly, right to life does come before lifestyle, so even if your life isn't the greatest, your baby still deserves a chance in this world.		it is different, however, with meat because it is not a lifestyle, it's a way of survival.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction tell me, are you killing a fetus to eat it? 		eating meat is not a lifestyle, it's survival.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction I meant "wisely" as in how the Native Americans used meat, not wasting any of it.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction this is a quality of life issue. they would not be able to function normally.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction ... abort your fetus all you want, that's just selfishness. but when you actually do it, that is an immoral action resulting from your feelings of selfishness.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction It's not selfish it's a way to live and get adequate nutrients for your body, something very important to you.		why would you abort fetuses so you can donate them? imagine shooting someone in the head just to study gunshot victims.		it's more than just selfish. you can want to...
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction ... have solid opinion and I have no idea about all that medical information about it so I'm not going to make an argument.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction go ahead, get everyone to stop eating meat and live off nuts.		you can donate the fetuses that naturally die. 		and that's like asking why it should be illegal to kill someon who got the job you wanted.		as for parasitic twins, I honestly haven't thought about that so don't ...
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction you're just repeating yourself. protein is necessary for survival, it's not selfish if you use the animal wisely. it is selfish to end a life solely because you don't feel like having a child.
i love when people block you in the middle of a respectable argument because that means you're winning.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction it is morally wrong because it is ending a life based on another's selfish wants, as I've said before.		it's not the hard way, it's the right way.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction To end this argument because it's gone on too long and isn't going anywhere - 		abortion is morally wrong. you can't justify it unless it is to save the mother. any other way is an easy way out of hardship and should be frowned upon.
I feel like Trump has no opinions of his own and his advisors just give him ideas that'll win.

@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction It hasn't been given A life though. It didn't choose to use the mother's body, but it has the right to have a choice in whether it lives.		We eat meat to survive. Killing fetuses is not necessary for our survival.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction I'm not deciding. The fetus is the only one who gets the choice, and it must be born and given a life because it isn't able to speak for itself as a fetus.
@LunaMay196 @miriam__s9 @LiveAction you cannot solve all your problems by killing.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction You don't get to decide that it shouldn't have a life because it might be unhappy. It is the fetus' right to live and grow up and make their own choices and work hard to obtain happiness.
@LunaMay196 @miriam__s9 @LiveAction They DON'T lose their chance at life.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction It does not have to be a baby to be a being. 		You should care that it becomes a baby, because you are depriving it of a happy life filled with laughs and cries and memories.
@LunaMay196 @miriam__s9 @LiveAction If the mother is unable to adequately raise a child, give it up for adoption.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction It's a fetus that becomes a baby without interference. 		And you are correct, it already has a life. That's why it shouldn't be ripped away from them.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction A mother with morals shouldn't allow her baby to lose it's chance at life.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction I have no problem with abortion if it is to save the mother's life. One life lost is better than both lives lost.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction Endangered creatures should be protected, from humans. 		She is obligated not to have it ripped out of her uterus and dismembered.		The fetus has it's own body, it is entitled to its own rights.
@LunaMay196 @LiveAction Your life will not be destroyed. The fetus' life is literally destroyed. You both deserve life, not one or the other.
@LunaMay196 @miriam__s9 @LiveAction It's not dismissing her's. Giving birth to a child does not kill a mother.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction Um that's because it isn't illegal for animals to kill one another.		Supporting the fetus is the mother's body's job. That doesn't give the mom the right to end it's life.
RT @UFBarstool: Gators up 3 at the Half 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction 1) it IS a person. if it has no moral relevance, why are turtle and bird eggs legally protected? because they are creatures and should be treated as so.		2) it is not the mother's body, it is the fetus'.
@LunaMay196 @LiveAction selfishness allows people to think it's ok. once this baby is conceived, it is not all about you.
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction "life begins at fertilization." so as a human life, why doesn't it get to live?
@miriam__s9 @LunaMay196 @LiveAction It has a heartbeat and a brain and arms and legs.
@LunaMay196 @LiveAction Why should the fetus be denied to right to live a happy life?
@LunaMay196 @LiveAction Are you not seeing my point? It is, in my opinion, immoral and I don't think people should do it.
@LunaMay196 @LiveAction I'm not arguing that abortions aren't safe for the mothers, I'm saying it's unsafe for the fetus.

@RAMRANTS @conservmillen participating in a gay marriage is against his beliefs, and I'm not an expert on Christianity, but I'm guessing it doesn't say you can't provide services to people who don't adhere to it. and there's no way possible he's gonna know everything that they do in their life.
@RAMRANTS @conservmillen there's a difference between denying someone because of their political beliefs and refusing to assist a marriage in which your religion forbids.

@Ocasio2018 Caseworkers are not going to protect us when they start invading our country. There will be a crisis when our own people are hurt because of their greed and anger. They are not asylum seekers, they want to steal our country.
Watch out, @chuckschumer, @Ocasio2018's coming for your seat.
@Ocasio2018 Let's see here:		➡️ 'Dumb Negro'	➡️ 'Trump's working with the Russians'	➡️ 'Conservatives are Nazis	➡️ 'Orange Man'	➡️ Nothing on Antifa Violence	➡️ 'Don't let them out in public'		Sit down, Alex.

RT @realDonaldTrump: It is my great honor to be with so many brilliant, courageous, patriotic, and PROUD AMERICANS. Seeing all of you here…
Karin Housley is running against a political nobody who didn't earn her seat. John James is running against a more than 4 decade career politician. And Bob Menendez, New Jersey's incumbent Senator, is ridden with scandals, so Bob Hugin is the clear choice.
Bob Hugin is a Marine Corps veteran who served as CEO of a biotech company working to cure diseases like cancer. A moderate, we can bet he'll do what's best for New Jersey and America, not him or his party.
John James is a husband and father of two. He served in the Army protecting our great country. He runs his campaign sending a message of bipartisanship, and as we all know this is much needed in today's political environment.
Karin Housley is a mom and grandma who is also married to an @NHL head coach. She serves in the Minnesota Senate and fights for personal liberties, economic growth, and political civility.
My focus is on 3 Republicans running in blue states:		@KarinHousley of Minnesota	@JohnJamesMI of Michigan	@BobHugin of New Jersey		All three are winners and are much needed to represent their future constituents.

Florida - Vote Scott	Tennessee - Vote Blackburn	Indiana - Vote Braun	Missouri - Vote Hawley 	Arizona - Vote McSally	Nevada - Vote Heller	West Virginia - Vote Morrisey	North Dakota - Vote Cramer	Montana - Vote Rosendale		Everyone there is a winner. Please get them to the Senate!

@madalenamcneil @senorrinhatch shame on him for sending respects to his colleague and friend who sacrificed so much for his country that died from cancer. such an awful thing to do
@FriesRandom @kerryreid @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 both sides have corruption. it will always be like that
@Kokilaloki @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 Republicans definitely cheer on death. That's why they advocate for safer schools without taking our rights away, seek to end fetus killing abortion, and push for illegal immigration to stop so rightful citizens lives won't be lost when they could have been prevented
@FriesRandom @kerryreid @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 let's see how many Democrats have paid money to silence women they've had affairs with. saluting a North Korean general while trying to create peace within our countries. and personally I think Trump was an idiot for insulting McCain
@SenSchumer Thank you Schumer that's actually a good idea.
would @MeghanMcCain ever run for office 🤔
@FriesRandom @kerryreid @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 I've never seen more hypocrisy than in the Dems. A Dem president does something, it's ok, GOP does exact same thing, it's monstrous. save the children, yet kill future children left and right. you can't say Republicans have no morals. we are the party that still knows respect
@RealCandaceO I hate how liberals scream "RACIST" all the time. It's an insult to the people who actually lived with racism and faced oppression.
@starbucksgirl51 @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 they do care about life, and so do you hopefully. but they can't control all death. yeah they can try and prevent it but what will happen is criminals will get guns and attack law-abiding citizens who gave up their guns, but now they won't have self defense
@FrancoTarb @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 no it's called Pro-Life because we are in favor of children's right to live. and it isn't flawed, LAWS DON'T STOP EVERYONE. "Locks only keep out the honest"
Liberals block you for having a civilized argument with them because they can't think of any more lies to say
@MichaelSPrete @DLoesch yet she's the terrorist 🤔
@wastedtime01 your welcome :) unusual sense of humor though
@FriesRandom @kerryreid @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 what you say when you don't know what else to say 👋
@FriesRandom @kerryreid @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 they are sensible. having guns is an important right
@FriesRandom @kerryreid @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 it's different. killing a living thing because you don't want a child is not the same as saving the life of 1 when 2 will die if you don't
@FriesRandom @kerryreid @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 1) 3/5 vote, not a person (which is wrong so don't call me racist) 2) racism is a very different issue than guns
@kerryreid @FriesRandom @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 yeah you can, but who would have a better chance, a mom with a hammer or a rapist with a gun?
@kerryreid @FriesRandom @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 abortion is the real mass-murder machine
@kerryreid @FriesRandom @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 free speech to speak your opinion, not make lies. 2A doesn't say only handguns (which most murders are committed by so banning assualt rifles wouldn't end murder)
@kerryreid @FriesRandom @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 yeah a hammer is just as effective as a gun
@kerryreid @FriesRandom @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 save a kid from living life, you mean?
@kerryreid @FriesRandom @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 the Constitution protects their right to the gun. they don't need it but the Constitution says they can bear arms. law abiding citizens didn't do anything to get that taken away from them.
@kerryreid @FriesRandom @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 if they can't find someone to adopt, they go into foster care. it sucks, but it's better than no life at all. eventually they will find a family
@FriesRandom @kerryreid @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 we should always try but taking away our right to protect ourselves will not work.
@kerryreid @FriesRandom @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 not letting mentally ill, terrorist watchlist people, or convicted criminals get guns. but again, it won't always work
@FriesRandom @kerryreid @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 no don't give up but the sick people who would kill children are the ones who don't give a crap about gun laws and will find a way.
@FriesRandom @kerryreid @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 ok, again, if it is necessary for the safety of the mom, im ok with it
@kerryreid @FriesRandom @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 sadly yes, but we can't stop all deaths
@kerryreid @FriesRandom @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 nope, because there are lots of people out there looking to help people by adopting. and I said before I am ok with it if it saves the mom
@FriesRandom @kerryreid @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 humans are murdered because of crazy and evil people. you can't take that out of the woods, there will always be bad people and you can't always stop them
@kerryreid @FriesRandom @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 sorry made a mistake but it's still alive
@FriesRandom @kerryreid @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 sorry not a baby, but still living
@kerryreid @FriesRandom @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 not if they abide by the laws. if they don't want to have a child, use protection, and if that doesn't work, put them up for adoption if you can't handle a child.
@kerryreid @FriesRandom @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 abortion is literally an act to end a babies life, while guns are just a tool used for self defense, and sadly sometimes to hurt others
@cpmaz @ahumorlessfem laws do matter. but they don't to criminals.
@kerryreid @FriesRandom @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 I'm not religious. but I believe it's murder and murder shouldn't be legal. and i agree with it if it saves the mom's life
@kerryreid @FriesRandom @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 honestly good point but abortions are morally wrong, guns aren't.
@ahumorlessfem do you think guns will just magically disappear from the world?
@Pinkykiss @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 how
@mortenbc58 @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 you illegally get one 🤦🏻‍♂️
@ahumorlessfem hmm, weirdly enough criminals don't care about the laws, they'll get guns anyway
@FriesRandom @tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 banning anything won't totally get rid of it, but there's a difference between illegally obtaining guns and performing unsafe illegal abortions.
@tizzywoman @DLoesch @g8r1521 do you not understand that taking guns away won't stop shootings. Republicans care about life, that's why it's called Pro-Life.
@ThinkingCC @IvankaTrump banning guns won't stop shootings, will just make us defenseless

@RizeUpPodcast @LHead44 @AbdulElSayed are you saying he's white because he's a conservative? pretty sure blacks are allowed to believe in freedom, that's why the Republican party was founded

@RizeUpPodcast @LHead44 @AbdulElSayed we did. Haley and Acosta
@RizeUpPodcast @LHead44 @AbdulElSayed is it not ok to have more whites than minorities. he doesn't care about what race they are, he just wants qualified people. and again, skin tone is nothing people of the same race have different tones. would you say "you aren't black because you're skin isn't dark enough"?
@RizeUpPodcast @LHead44 @AbdulElSayed um not that it matters but Nikki Haley has brown skin. skin tone means nothing.
@RizeUpPodcast @LHead44 @AbdulElSayed Nikki Haley is Indian. Alex Acosta is Cuban. Logic says they're minorities. saying they pass for white makes no sense and is offensive

@thezackmorgan @Hobie_SHRED @realDonaldTrump what's unsettling is that they won't stand for the nation that gives them freedom
@thezackmorgan @Hobie_SHRED @realDonaldTrump why is it unsettling
@Zillablue @Hobie_SHRED @realDonaldTrump just because the liberal veterans are ok with it doesn't mean other vets aren't disrespected.
@thezackmorgan @Hobie_SHRED @realDonaldTrump yea because a little suspension from a game that you already get millions is just like enprisonment
@thezackmorgan @Hobie_SHRED @realDonaldTrump they have the right to protest, yes. but shouldn't they at least thank veterans who gave them the right by not protesting during the anthem. find another way
@thezackmorgan @Hobie_SHRED @realDonaldTrump they didn't intend for people to disrespect veterans. but you liberals should look at what the founding fathers intended, because you don't usually care
@thezackmorgan @Hobie_SHRED @realDonaldTrump like I just said, Trump is not putting them in prison. this is nothing like North Korea
@thezackmorgan @Hobie_SHRED @realDonaldTrump it's not like he wants to put them in prison.
