‚ÄúThat Black woman is trying to take another Black man down‚Äù is a saying imagined as defending Black men or Black people when it is really defending one man who happens to be Black.
The saying is imagined in Black male logic as a woke or progressive or radical idea even as it conserves the rope of rape culture that also hangs blame on Black male survivors. It conserves patriarchal male power which has conserved White supremacy.
It shows how much White and Black men have in common in their dismissal of survivors as merely ‚Äútrying to take them down.‚Äù
It centers Black male denials and ‚Äúpain‚Äù and dismisses the accusations and pain of Black women survivors, reinforcing the old racist idea of the un-rape-able Black woman popularized by White male slave-owning rapists deflecting blame by demeaning their Black woman victims.
Every time I hear it, I‚Äôm flush with shame as a Black male who can remember when I said it, as a historian who can locate its function and history.
If I could remove any destructive saying from the lips of Black men (and their apologists), then up first for removal: ‚ÄúThat Black woman is trying to take another Black man down.‚Äù

And striving  for cultural overlap connotes there‚Äôs a cultural standard we should move toward, we should overlap. Now what group‚Äôs culture will be that standard? I can guess the answer.

Antiracist ideas suggest the problem of our society is not groups of people failing to assimilate so we can all be the ugly and assimilated same, but our policies and ideas are failing to treat the beautiful difference of human groups equally.
When I say difference, I mean only phenotypic and cultural difference (not our genetic and behavioral sameness).
Antiracist ideas, by comparison, suggest there is nothing wrong or right with any and every racial group. Antiracist ideas, by comparison, respect and level and value the differences between the racial groups.
Assimilationist ideas are racist ideas because they are based on the assumption there is something wrong with another racial group that needs changing or something right with our racial group that doesn‚Äôt need changing.
Anytime we say something is wrong with a racial group, we are articulating a racist idea. Anytime we say that racial group should change to be more like our racial group‚Äîor to be more American, which is code word for White American‚Äîwe are articulating an assimilationist idea.

A lexicon produced by conservatives and consumed by liberals. A MAGA lexicon framing White people as the victims and Black Lives Matter activists as racist oppressors. A lexicon that prevents Americans from fully acknowledging let alone radically challenging anti-Black racism.
‚ÄúAll lives matter‚Äù can be found in the same lexicon of ‚Äúreverse discrimination‚Äù and ‚Äúrace neutral‚Äù and ‚Äúcolor blind‚Äù and ‚Äúpost-racial‚Äù and ‚Äúonly one race, the human race‚Äù and ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all biased‚Äù and ‚Äúboth sides.‚Äù
What should be clear is Democrats and especially leading Democrats should stop incorporating ‚Äúall lives matter‚Äù into their statements. ‚ÄúAll lives matter‚Äù as a retort to ‚ÄúBlack lives matter‚Äù is a racist idea. (2)
I‚Äôm not exactly clear what Speaker Pelosi is saying here. Is this a reflection of her dueling consciousness of antiracist and racist ideas that reflects the Democratic Party? (1) https://t.co/Tjl9z98pIJ

To defend #RKelly is to broadcast that you are a sexual predator or wannabe sexual predator of women and girls. This is not merely about misogyny or blind loyalty or woeful ignorance.

We have to defeat the voter suppressors in order to defeat their voter suppression as the voter suppression makes it extremely difficult to defeat the voter suppressors.
It seems to me that @staceyabrams and @andrewgillum and Bill Nelson won enough voters but may not win the contest against their votes. That is the contest they are fighting to win right now. They are fighting battles they should not be fighting.
Voter suppression is as fundamental to American politics as voting. Elections have two contests. The contest for votes and the contest against votes. Winning a majority of voters is not enough to win in the United States of America.

And too many times, non-White men and women have believed their victimhood. History does not just repeat. History devastates until we devastate their power to reinforce their power on their claims of victimhood.
When their officers recklessly killed, they presented themselves as victims of the defenders of Black lives. When women started saying #MeToo, they presented themselves as victims of conspiracies.
When they segregated America, they presented themselves as victims of civil rights activists. When they mass incarcerated and deported millions, they presented themselves as victims of ‚Äúcriminal‚Äù immigrants and Blacks.
When they violently resisted Reconstruction, they presented themselves as victims of Black politicians. When they disenfranchised, they presented themselves as victims of suffragists.
When they raped enslaved Black women, they presented themselves as victims of Black women‚Äôs advances. When they stole Native American land they presented themselves as victims of Native people fighting for their land.
When they snatched liberty from Black people they presented themselves as victims of British snatchers of their liberty. When they enslaved people they presented themselves as victims of those resisting their enslavement.
To understand American history is to understand the sensational fairytales of White male victimhood where the victimizers are the victims and the victims are the victimizers.
I think it high time to point out the destructive history of angry White men and their fake tears and real shouts. All those powerful &amp; patriarchal &amp; racist White men who presented themselves as victims of plots to take them down, meaning their freedom to assault us, to rule U.S.

It is amazing how often journalists use the vocabulary of racism while imagining themselves as objective. I suspect most journalists do not realize it. We all have been taught racist vocabulary words. ‚ÄúRace-blind‚Äù and ‚Äúcolor-blind‚Äù are in the dictionary of racist ideas.
What are race-blind admission standards? Standardized tests that were created by eugenicists? College-prep courses that Black and Latinx students are less like to have access to? GPA scores that are boosted by those AP and IB courses? Show me a race-blind admission standard.

We can't transcend race-based identities until we eliminate racial inequality and the racist policies causing it. Why is that so abhorrent? https://t.co/aM52EAzhYh
@RobTaber Thanks for presenting on #Stamped.
@russ_jokes Thanks Russ for reading the book and writing that piece.
Instead of challenging voter suppression, some liberals are focused on challenging identity politics.
And instead of looking inward, the Democratic Party ridicules and blames those alienated voters.
Democrats lose because of voter suppression and voter alienation.
How could any thinking Democrat look at this data and proclaim Democrats lose because of Democrats focus on identity politics? https://t.co/BYhceXps4D
@DamonLinker Yet you would say they're in power because Dems focus on IP, ignoring or downplaying voter suppression laws justified through bigotry.
Exactly wrong. If the left plays by the rules of bigotry, it will lose. Americans against forms of bigotry are in the majority. Outnumbered. https://t.co/MTdOZJ3IQT

RT @rosaclemente: @DrIbram The first identity politic was whiteness and Donald Trump ran with that all the way to the White House.
If we don't defend the other identities--women, people of color, poor, LGBTQs--then White male identity will reign under a cloak of unity.
I am drawing a straight line from Donald Trump to Mark Lilla, from Reps to Dems--the political line defending White male identity.
Trump's pardon of #JoeArpaio is an act of identity politics. It is a political defense of the identity of White male racism.
Whenever I see White men like Mark Lilla critical of identity politics, I am watching their White male identity politics at play.
The irony is Republicans have been more focused on IP: the identities of Whites &amp; males &amp; elites, especially White male elites.
But advanced identity politics doesn't directly name identities, which Republicans have mastered from Nixon to Trump.
Critics of identity politics define it in simple terms, naming identities. But...
Actually Democrats lose because White male identity keeps winning. But Mark Lilla and Co. veils White male identity.	https://t.co/1ycUyGMa44
