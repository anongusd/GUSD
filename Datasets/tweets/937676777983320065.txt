A CLIP OF HIM DOING BLACKFACE. To my knowledge, Kimmel has not apologized for any of this (he might have said that blackface was a mistake but has defended the show otherwise.)
Clips of him calling the leaders of women‚Äôs suffrage as ‚Äúpioneers of bitching and complaining.‚Äù Clips of him joking that men who are famous can get away with peeking up women‚Äôs skirts. Clips of him dry humping random women without their consent.
Clips of Kimmie and/or his cast members denouncing women on the street as being ugly, whores, or simply too fat for any of them to want to have sex with. Numerous clips of them throwing numbers at women based on their rating of them 1-10.
The show included clips of @jimmykimmel approaching random women asking them to touch his crotch (if they refused then he asked if they would put their mouths on it), clips of him asking random women to have sex with him and then chasing them if they tried to run away...
Haven‚Äôt heard of the man show? It‚Äôs how @jimmykimmel rose to fame in the 90s on a racist, homophobic, sexist, DISGUSTING show. And I understand that the show was supposed to be ‚Äúsatirical,‚Äù but there is nothing funny about it.

Anyways it‚Äôs 100 degrees in Sydney so I‚Äôm chalking it up to being overheated and possibly my propension for generalized anxiety but I‚Äôm okay. Thankfully after lying down my body regained the strength to be pampered at the nail salon.
And then I faint. While sitting in the freaking massage chair. I only lost consciousness for several seconds but that‚Äôs all it took for the poor women (both much smaller than me) to drag me out of the chair and lay me down in another room, frantic the whole time.
And I‚Äôm there literally sitting in one of those big chairs while one woman‚Äôs doing my toes and the others doing my fingers and all of a sudden I‚Äôm super nauseous...so I tell the ladies I need some water.
Starting with today. I went to the nail salon cause my plans keep getting canceled and I‚Äôm all like ‚Äúwhat can‚Äôt a mani-pedi fix?‚Äù In this cold lonely world
So I decided maybe I‚Äôll start sharing some pieces of my world on here so maybe strangers can laugh as my life is fairly ridiculous lately.
