A: I don’t know what to say about this that really captures the heartbreak I feel. We are tearing families apart. This is a travesty of epic proportions. All I can ask is that we keep this at the forefront and demand the reunification of these families.
Q: 1,475 kids don’t just vanish. What are you doing to find these children and reunite them with their families that love them?
A: We have to do so much more. Now that we are in the majority, Democrats can write appropriation bills that really prioritize housing needs across the country, including here in Seattle.
Q: Congress is not addressing the need for funding for housing voucher programs. What can be done?
Q: How do you do it?		A: I do it because I get to come home to you! I get to wake up every day knowing what I get to fight for.
A: This administration has consistently vilified the LGBTQI community and we won’t stand for this. We need to do more. We will be passing the Equality Act this year in Congress.
Q: What can intersex folks do to get the safe housing and community we need and deserve?
A: The lowest hanging fruit is the ability for Medicare to negotiate the prices of pharmaceuticals. That’s a bill on the table right now.
Q: Has anyone entertained the idea of a suggested retail price on a pharmaceutical drug?
This president has tried to divide us, instead of uniting us and representing every person in this country. We have to stand in opposition, but we need to be a proposition policy as well. We need bold proposals.
Democracy only works when people are engaged. We, together, turned out in record numbers to take back the House. This is the most diverse Congress in the history of our country. Congress is starting to look a lot more like America.

I agree with David Bier:  "Before Congress even considers funding a border wall, it should demand answers for why the government will not process asylum seekers at ports."
(6) What a farce Trump's whole "crisis on the border" is.  The only crisis is the humanitarian crisis of asylum seekers trying to seek asylum legally--which is their right and our responsibility--and being turned away.  Trump doesn't want asylum seekers processed anywhere.
(5) Trump claims a record number of families &amp; children now.		BUT the number of families &amp; children is down 43% from Oct. 2016 to Dec. 2018.		YET detention beds went UP from 34,000 to 45,000 to the current almost 48,000.
(4) DHS Inspector Gen said the processing limit could've INCREASED # of people who come ILLEGALLY, writing that it “saw evidence that limiting volume of asylum-seekers entering at ports of entry leads some aliens who would otherwise seek legal entry to cross border illegally.”
(3) In fact, undocumented arrivals at border actually FELL 9% from Oct 2016 to Dec 2018.		YET, @DHSgov halved the shared of migrants processed from 32% to 16%.
(2) In Dec '18, DHS Sec. Nielsen testified that border ports had reached "capacity," &amp; couldn't process asylum seekers--as a result, they "limited" asylum processing.	BUT govt data shows those same ports admitted 2x as many undoc immigrants in Oct 2016 as they did in Dec 2018.
THREAD: Let's break down wild claims &amp; lies of Trump &amp; GOP around "surge" of migrants &amp; therefore their demand for more money for processing of these migrants at the border. This piece (https://t.co/R5fcqcGxn9) from libertarian @CatoInstitute does it. Ready? Here we go. (1)

Trust science. Trust fact. Trust that I will do everything in my power to make sure we make major progress in ensuring clean air, clean water and a clean planet for ALL of us. #SOTU
And NO mention of protections for the environment or the fight against climate change. Here’s the real #SOTU Fact ✅: climate change isn’t going away. It’s escalating and we’re ALL dealing with the consequences.
I find it hard to take @realDonaldTrump’s comments on anti-Semitism very seriously when this is the same man that described white supremacists chanting “Jews will not replace us” as “very good people.” #SOTU
#SOTU Fact ✅: NOT reducing drug prices at all. Pharmaceutical companies have already raised prices on more than 1,000 drugs in 2019 alone, including increases of nearly 10%!
#SOTU Fact ✅: A border wall won’t keep opioids out of the country. It’s not a national security necessity. Border apprehensions remain near historic lows. BOTH of Trump’s @DHSgov secretaries dismissed the efficacy of a border wall. I could go on and on. Just not correct.
Don’t get me started on the wall. #SOTU
I’m not even going to dignify this with a #SOTU Fact ✅. None of this is even remotely true. The border is more secure than ever. Enough.
Our adversaries abroad? The Mueller Investigation is trying to see if YOUR TEAM worked with adversaries abroad against OUR country! #SOTU
#SOTU Fact ✅: Not the best economy in our history. 🤷🏾‍♀️ The gap between the richest Americans and everyone else has actually GROWN under Trump’s watch.
#SOTU Fact ✅: Trump’s done NOTHING for health care. Trump’s proposed Medicare and Medicaid rules would increase out-of-pocket costs, drive up premiums and put health care out of reach for countless Americans. Health care is a RIGHT, not a privilege just for the rich.
#SOTU Fact ✅: The #GOPTaxScam didn’t create jobs. It didn’t pay for itself. It didn’t give back to American workers. All it did was swell the deficit by TRILLIONS and give a pay-out to his buddies in Wall Street.
#SOTU Fact ✅: Not phenomenal employment numbers. During Trump’s first two years, the economy has added jobs at a SLOWER rate than during Obama’s last two years.
“Break decades of political stalemate.” That’s rich. Trump held the entire country hostage over a temper tantrum over his vanity wall. There was a bipartisan plan. He threw it aside. That decision was HIS, nobody else’s. #SOTU

Truly transformative organizing is necessary for implementing a truly transformative vision, grounded in human rights, equity and justice for all of us. Instead of inequity, fear, and scarcity, our work will always focus on justice, abundance, generosity and love. #MLK2019
Remember that the setbacks we may see emerging are happening ONLY because we are making progress. This is the era of the people, a movement moment, a time when we have finally moved away from the myth of the likely voter to the truth of every voter. #MLK2019
We can’t allow ourselves to be divided, because especially we black and brown people know that when we are divided or get distracted by a hierarchy of oppressions, our oppressors win.  It is the same forces of hate and intolerance allied against us. #MLK2019
As the richest nation on the planet, we have to redouble our efforts to ensure the human rights of all people inside our country and outside, knowing that we are tied in that inescapable web of mutuality. #MLK2019
Our power comes from our ability to connect the dots and fight for ALL of us, which means we cannot address immigrant rights without addressing civil rights, incarceration, economic justice or environmental justice. #MLK2019
This is not about a physical structure along the southern border.  It is really about pushing back against the terrible criminalizing and otherizing of so many in this country that has come from the White House.  It is really about the SOUL of our country. #MLK2019 https://t.co/FePAlX1sFn

We have a moral responsibility to ensure we have clean air, clean water and healthy communities for all. As this administration continues to push our planet toward a path of destruction, we need to find real solutions. That starts with accepting science, not ignoring it.

@LiberalNcali @repmarkpocan Not true. Rule can be waived by Rules Chair for committee hearing.  Waiver then gets included in rule to bring bill to the floor. Majority always votes together on the rule. If conservative Dems don’t want to vote for rule, they wouldn’t vote for it whether or not it had PayGo.
I hope all @HouseDemocrats will support this legislation.
That is why @RepMarkPocan and I will be introducing legislation shortly to repeal PayGo and have a hearing on it to highlight all the reasons why PayGo is bad policy and bad for millions of working Americans who deserve a bold, visionary progressive agenda.
Even taking PayGo out of Rules package does not address the real problem which is that it is a statutory requirement and it needs legislation to take it out of statute.
I also secured a commitment from @RepMcGovern that PayGo will be waived for #MedicareForAll &amp; other progressive priorities. He has unilateral power to do this as the powerful Rules Committee Chair &amp; I appreciate his working w/ us on our priorities as a strong progressive himself https://t.co/rK1CMOPoAz
Importantly, we were able to eliminate the 3/5 majority rules on raising taxes and to ensure that War Powers Resolutions are provided a direct vote in the House.
.@RepMarkPocan and I had numerous meetings with @RepMcGovern, House Leadership and new Members about our concerns with the PayGo statute in the Rules Package. As a result of our conversations, we were able to secure numerous progressive priorities in this package.

Medicare for All is not a crazy idea.		Do you know what is crazy? That Harry Truman first called for national federal  health care in 1949 and that, over 70 years later, we’re still arguing for the “radical” idea that health care is a human right.

In the end, here’s the real truth: When workers do better, companies do better. When workers have more to spend, the economy does better.  Most of all, we restore the idea of America as a place of opportunity for everyone not just the wealthy few.
Second, ban the practice of stock buybacks—which just means that profits that should be going to workers is instead going to shareholders.  Think of workers as the engine that generates profits and must share in the wealth they create rather than an expense to be minimized.
The fact is that GDP growth means nothing when 90% of it goes to the top 1%, as is true today.		Read my op-ed in @FortuneMagazine on how to rebuild the middle class. To start, increase the min. wage to $15/hour and raise earnings for 41 million workers. https://t.co/auYosfoLvK

Answer: This has shown us one thing: Republicans can't govern. I'm ecstatic to know that Democrats will be taking over in the 116th Congress. We're holding strong: if they can pass it on their own, they don't need us. If they can't, then they better start talking to us.
Answer: Republicans control EVERY branch of government. There shouldn't be a shutdown in the first place. We won't throw away money toward an unnecessary border wall. We have put forward options. If Republicans need our votes, then they need to work with us.
Scott from Seattle asks what do Democrats have in their toolbox to pass a budget and prevent a shutdown.
Answer: We have more women in Congress than ever before—I really believe we will tackle this issue in the 116th. Republicans have been trying for years to strip away our rights. Women all over the United States have shown that we won't let that happen.
Theresa from Seattle asks about the current status of women's reproduction rights in the United States.
Answer: College for All! Student loan debt is a drain on the economy. Next year, we will investigation Betsy DeVos, cut down on for-profit colleges and their fraudulent degrees, invest in tech and trade schools and address the over $1.3 TRILLION of student debt in this country.
Anjali from Seattle asks how can we make higher education more affordable.
Answer: The first step to this is really rebuilding the infrastructure of Puerto Rico. We have to start from scratch here. We can use this opportunity to do something revolutionary. I am deeply, deeply angry about the way this President has treated the situation in Puerto Rico.
Answer: We need not only roads and bridges, but schools, water systems and a number of ways to create a renewable energy grid across the country. The goal is to have a green infrastructure package in the first six months.
Stephanie from Seattle asks how can we push past Trump and invest in infrastructure.
Answer: Impeachment is a political act. We are in a position where we have to lay out the information that we have and really push what the president is doing. I will be at the forefront of that fight.
Answer: I was one of 60 Democrats to advance articles of impeachment against Trump. Immediately in the Judiciary Committee, we will start having hearings on obstruction of justice, collusion, etc., These are serious, unprecedented issues.
Barbara from Seattle asks if I would be willing to support the impeachment of Donald Trump.
Answer: Lack of affordability. Education, health care, child care, housing and more. Young people, in particular, are feeling a real lack of choice. 62% of Americans don't have 1,000 in their bank account. These are all pieces of how to restore opportunity and equity.
Evan from Lake Forest Park asks what is the most important issue affecting our district.
Answer: Congress mainly works on this issue through vouchers and other support. We need to do better. We're working on all levels—city, state and federal—to find lasting answers to this issue.
David from Seattle asks about what we can do to address the homelessness crisis in WA-07.
Answer: It's time to put people over profit. I'm very proud to tell you that I will be leading on H.R. 676, Medicare for All, in the next Congress. I am incredibly excited to be leading that conversation in the 116th Congress.
Answer: Health care has been one of my top priorities in Congress. We were able to defeat #Trumpcare at the beginning of the year, but they did undermine our health care protections under the ACA. We will strengthen these protections immediately in January.
Glenn from Shoreline asks about what Democrats intend to do about the health care system in the next Congress.
Answer: I believe we will be able to establish the Select Committee on the Green New Deal. We'll see legislation, hearings, reports and more in the next Congress. We need to use every tool in the toolbox to fight against climate change.
Vishili from Seattle asks how will we advanced the Green New Deal in the next Congress.
Answer: We will continue to fight to make sure the Internet is open and available for everybody. This is an equity issue as much as it is anything else. You will see us take up this fight again in the 116th.
Tyler from Seattle asks if we will try to overturn Net Neutrality when Democrats take back the House in January.
We are going to have a very busy 116th Congress. I can't wait to be in the majority—I've never been in the majority in my life, not just in Congress! To be here, sitting in this office in the United States Capitol, is truly the greatest honor of my life.
Two weeks ago, I went to the border to meet with asylum seekers. It became clear to me that this is a manufactured humanitarian crisis. We are violating our own laws as well as international human rights treaties.
Meeting with you is my favorite part of this job. We have been able to serve over 800 constituents this year and recovered over $1.45 million for our constituents. As an office, we make sure we do everything we can to help you. This is YOUR office.
The progressive movement has never been stronger and I’m looking forward to working with my Co-Chair Congressman Mark Pocan and all of you to translate that strength into real wins for working people, women, immigrants, those living in poverty and the most marginalized.

It shouldn’t take intervention from a Member of Congress and an incredibly compassionate Border Patrol Chief for those fleeing violence and persecution to seek asylum in the United States.
Initially they were denied, in violation of U.S. and international law, but I was able to intervene and ensure that they could simply present themselves for asylum in the United States.
I was able to successfully assist 5 asylum seekers - 2 unaccompanied minors, a mother and her 9 year old child, and a young man with a serious medical condition - into the United States.

It cannot be lost on any of us that the shooter targeted the Jewish community in part for its strong support of refugees and immigrants. Tonight’s vigil reminds us of the the urgent need for us to speak out loudly and clearly against those who seek to divide us.

David described being tortured as “the best experience in my life. Being tortured is like running a marathon.  It taught me how committed I am in the struggle for justice.  And it has fortified me in some ways, because you learn how much capacity you have in this body.”
In addition to @weareoneamerica, the Pramila For Congress Campaign, &amp; Working Washington, David worked for many years at @SEIU in Portland &amp; Seattle, helping to organize low-wage workers &amp; bring justice to the workplace. He loved to dance and brought joy and resolve to every job.
Later, when I decided to run for Congress in 2016, David left his job at @workingwa to run the field program for my campaign, overseeing an operation of six organizers and over 1,000 volunteers that knocked on 120,000 doors and made over 240,000 phone calls to help elect me.
I was proud to have David serve as the Organizing Director at OneAmerica, where he helped build our statewide organizing network using the Latin American concept of “base groups” to expand our presence in places from Skagit County to Yakima to Vancouver.
Last night, David Ayala-Zamora passed away. A union organizer and immigrant rights organizer, David was a true champion for justice. His early experiences being tortured in El Salvador shaped the core of his character &amp; he brought that strength &amp; resilience to everything he did.

Thank you @DeepakBhargava, @Re4mImmigration, @AijenPoo, @CrisAlexJimenez, @CHIRLA, @weareoneamerica, @MaketheRoadNY, @CASAMaryland, @ICIRR, &amp; so many more immigrant rights organizations across the country who have been worked for so long on theto build the movement for justice.
One thing that has become crystal clear to me: Dems will never "out-enforce" this GOP. Trump &amp; cronies want to keep immigration out there as a divisive, wedge issue. They are not interested in fixing it. Their "compromise" is to stop legal immigration, period. It's up to Dems.
THIS. “Though everyone says the system is broken, there’s also a nod-nod wink-wink belief that it is broke, so don’t fix it," said Appleby. "The crops are being picked. The tables are being bused. The only wronged party are undocumented immigrants with little political power."
With @AnnaGalland &amp; @AijenPoo, we helped rally people everywhere to condemn Trump's outrageous family separations as moral issue. "Until recently, Americans have tended to view immigration less as a moral issue and more in crass economic terms." #FamiliesBelongTogether
Proud to be in the movement w/my dear friend @CrisAlexJimenez: “The days are gone for any Democrat to think that saying ‘I stand with immigrants’ is enough. We expect to see them boldly put forward an alternative to the administration’s mass-deportation agenda."
Bashing candidates 4 being pro-immigrant doesn't work."When Republicans used this playbook last year, the politics of immigration proved not quite what they hoped..[there was] real backlash w/suburban voters, in part b/c it connected to anti-immigrant thrust of Trump’s persona.”
This feels true, @DraperRobert: "Somehow Jayapal would have to navigate both sides—agitating and legislating, crossing the border back and forth, somberly aware that when it came to immigration issues, even an easy vote felt to some like a perilous journey, destination unknown."
.@NYTMag cover is long look at the politics of #immigration &amp; raises the work ahead for Dems. I've always believed that immigration is not just abt policy, it's abt who we are as a country &amp; what we're willing to stand up for. Proud to be profiled in this. https://t.co/tGCR9PeulQ

What would have alarmed the drafters of the Constitution are: 1) that 90% of documents related to Kavanaugh were not released; 2) that GOP could not find a nominee that would be respected by majority of our country; 3) that Collins &amp; GOP going to confirm this untenable nominee.
Thank you @lisamurkowski for speaking from the heart and voting from both the heart and the mind.

As I listen to Chairman Grassley speak on the floor about the"terrible left wing" attempts to stop kavanaugh's confirmation, all I can think is: MERRICK GARLAND, MERRICK GARLAND, MERRICK GARLAND, MERRICK GARLAND, MERRICK GARLAND, MERRICK GARLAND.
3. Why is  a SC justice constantly using public (conservative) outlets to make his case? Unprecedented. 		Even a retired Supreme Court Justice felt it necessary to speak out against Kavanaugh, a change of heart from his previous feelings. Kavanaugh should not be confirmed. (3/3)
2. Kavanaugh just doesn't understand his privilege. And now more than ever, we need justices who do, who have an ounce of humility, &amp; do not see this job as an entitlement. (2/3)

If a careful examination of the entire scope of his legal history - thus far withheld from the Senate - demonstrates that Kavanaugh lied under oath, the constitutionally prescribed remedy would be impeachment proceedings.
We cannot have someone with a record of possible perjury on the Supreme Court. 		We are committed to exercising our constitutional oversight authorities to obtain the full record of Kavanaugh's time in the Bush administration, only 10% of which has been available.
He may have misled the Senate regarding his involvement in the administration’s legal rationale for torture and indefinite detention, his knowledge of sexual misconduct claims against former Judge Kozinski and the use of stolen Senate nomination documents.

We've fought back against Trump's hateful immigration policies time and time again, and this time will be no different. We will fight for immigrant rights, for the future of our nation, and for dignity and opportunity for all.
This rule will make us a sicker, poorer, hungrier, worse-off nation. This isn't what America is about. We are a place for the "huddled masses yearning to breathe free." We are a place where the American dream can thrive.		We are better than this—we must demand better than this.
The administration claims a "public charge" system would protect taxpayer dollars, but Trump didn't care about savings when he used his #GOPTaxScam to throw money at corporations and the wealthiest. Immigrants pay billions in taxes each year, this isn't about money.
Leaked DHS documents show the administration wants to make it harder for some immigrants to stay here if they or their families have used programs ranging from Medicaid to subsidized insurance to support for pregnant women and new mothers to housing vouchers and more.
Parents are withdrawing their children from WIC. They're opting out of health insurance and medical care. They are fully eligible to use these programs, but this administration's threats to their permanent citizenship are scaring them away.
Trump's latest attack on immigrants: He wants to rip earned benefits from documented people, U.S. citizen kids and other eligible groups.		No matter how Trump spins it, this has never been about legality—it's always been about stepping on immigrant rights.	https://t.co/r47kj4bEbL

Funding for the TPPP is supposed to go to proven, science-based methods to help educate teens, curb teen pregnancy rates and innovate new strategies for success. Trump's administration is demanding ineffective abstinence-only programs, leaving teens without key resources.

What makes it worse is that there were also reports of Trump officials threatening Ecuador, the original sponsor, with trade sanctions and withdrawal of military aid if it did not alter or pull back the resolution. 		*All* of this is just plain wrong.
Alternatives like infant formula have a role, if a mother so chooses or if deemed medically necessary. 		The resolution was widely expected to be non-controversial and be adopted unanimously, until @realDonaldTrump's team went out of its way to favor a narrow group of companies.
Studies show breastfeeding, for those able, improves infant and maternal health outcomes. One showed that over 820,000 lives could be saved every year among children under 5, if all children 0-23 months were optimally breastfed. Breastfeeding improves IQ and school attendance.
Here's the article that broke this story earlier this month... 		The resolution was based on decades of research showing mother's milk is healthiest. It called for limiting "inaccurate or misleading marketing of breast milk substitutes." Pretty simple. https://t.co/2jVBF87brx

A mom told us her relationship with her 8yo daughter would never be the same. Officials lied to the daughter, saying her mom abandoned her. They said she'd live in a shelter until she was 18. When they reunited, the daughter believed that and wanted nothing to do with her mom.
Reportedly, 463 parents were already deported, presumably without their kids. This doesn't account for kids who are separated from other caretakers. #FamiliesBelongTogether
We must make clear that the U.S. still has a heart. No matter what Trump says, no matter how Sessions tries to slam our doors on people who are fleeing unspeakable violence, we will keep demanding the U.S. be that beacon of hope.
What we saw was horrifying:	- 70+ people being prosecuted en masse	- Mothers in cages who told us that Border Patrol only let them see their kids for 1 hour each day	- Kids in cages who had to sleep on mats on the ground	- Devastated parents
Last Friday, we visited the sites that people experience when they first arrive in the U.S. Ports of entry, mass prosecutions in courthouses, cages holding children and families, adult detention centers, and shelters where some families have thankfully been released.

If Americans are not granted the same access to Tibet that the Chinese enjoy in the United States, then there should be consequences.
This bill seeks to reset the table. It simply requires that if Chinese officials, journalists, and other citizens are able to travel freely in the United States, then it’s only fair that their American counterparts be able to do the same.
China's position has prevented U.S. diplomats and journalists from observing human rights abuses in Tibet. Not only that, Tibetan Americans have been prevented from visiting their home country.

Trump's proposed budget ignores our nation's morals by:	➡️Increasing the deficit to $984 billion	➡️Pouring $18B into an ineffective border wall	➡️Cutting EPA spending by 25%		And the GOP is working to add riders to the budget that further hurt our families and communities.
A budget is about more than just where money goes and when. It’s a promise about who we are, what we care about and what we’re willing to stand up for. 		Our #PeoplesBudget promise is to stand up for the American people and never back down.
We're also demanding more for our climate. Clean air and clean water are human rights.		Polluters must pay their fair share for the waste they create. Tax breaks that prioritize the fossil fuel industry must end. We must prioritize frontline communities and renewable energy.
As Trump pushes to ramp up excessive border spending and hire more border patrol agents, we're saying no.		I just returned from the border and what I saw was heartbreaking—kids in cages, awful conditions and continued family separation. We can't keep funding this broken system.

No one should be one health care crisis away from bankruptcy. No one should be denied care.		Our #M4ACaucus will fight for this belief and we will continue advocating for #MedicareForAll. We hope you’ll join us. ✊🏾
Our @USProgressives poll underscored the fact that ideas that we call “progressive” are really supported by the majority of Americans—lower health care costs, the ability to negotiate prescription drug prices and removing pre-existing conditions.		Congress must deliver on this.
These ideas aren’t outlandish—the American people stand with us.		➡️59% of Americans support a national Medicare for All plan and 92% of working-age adults think all Americans should have the right to affordable health care.
A system like #MedicareForAll would cut costs. It has been estimated that by simplifying our multi-payer system to a single-payer one, we can save $350 billion each year. And, under M4A, we'd be able to take out the corporate influence that drives prescription drug prices.
Health care costs are skyrocketing and we must act now.		@FamiliesUSA estimates that annually 26,000 adults die due to lack of access to care. In Washington state, one in 10 people report they've delayed necessary care because of its cost. This isn't how it should be.
We want to make sure that everyone has a practical understanding of how we can make this system work: we're ensuring that partners and providers across the nation are able to connect with members of Congress to have open discussions about what #MedicareForAll would look like.
Our #M4ACaucus will help build the evidence base for #MedicareforAll. We'll spread the word on everything from M4A basics to financing to information on health care around the world. We will make sure members of Congress and their staff have the resources to move M4A forward.
With @keithellison, @RepDebDingell, @repmarkpocan, @NationalNurses, @popdemoc, @SSWorks, @Public_Citizen, activists, advocates and 62 other members of Congress, we are fighting for the conviction that health care is a human right. #MedicareForAll #M4ACaucus
Just days before the 53rd anniversary of @MedicareGov, I'm proud to launch our #MedicareForAll Caucus as a founding co-chair.		We're united today because we know health care must be affordable and accessible to ALL people in the U.S.		Medicare for All is the way forward.
Today is the day! We're launching our #MedicareForAll Caucus in the House. Health care cannot be a luxury that's only available for the wealthy and well-connected—it is a human right. 		Join the #M4ACaucus LIVE now:	https://t.co/1bE5h2imYR https://t.co/UxGLLO3aW3

Trump has left the American people wondering who this president really  represents. Even more, with Trump’s refusal to accept the facts of  Russian interference in our elections, he essentially invites Russia and other foreign powers to continue to attack our next elections.
I have always believed in diplomacy and dialogue, even with those with  whom we have the greatest tensions. However, what we saw today was the  President of the United States belittling our country’s own men and  women in the intelligence community.

This is about the integrity of our Democracy. The American people simply want to know this: Are lawmakers accountable to me or to those with the most money?		There is only one right answer. We must always be working for the best interests of the people.
Americans should be able to trust that their elected officials work for them, not for whoever has the most money.		We're drafting a bill to stop members of congressional committees from being financed by the special interests that are under the jurisdiction of those committees.
These groups spend millions to woo mostly GOP lawmakers and move the national agenda toward ever-expanding mass incarceration. They use money to drive up the number of detained people—then they profit off of those detentions.		We're creating a plan to end this.
The outsized influence of big money is clear in many areas, especially the way we deal with private prisons and immigration detention in this country.		In 2017 alone, the top two private prison companies contributed $10 million to lobby congress on DHS appropriations.

The humane, cost-effective and simple solution we need is the Family Case Management Program (FCMP).		Before Trump terminated it, FCMP kept families together and kept them out of prison and had a 99% success rate. 		From my June letter to the DHS Appropriations Subcommittee: https://t.co/far0Iixkxy
Under current law, the government must release children from family detention centers within 20 days.		But the Trump administration is arguing for indefinite detention - INDEFINITE DETENTION - so it can maintain its cruel zero-tolerance, zero-humanity policy.
"In a ruling that countered nearly every argument posed by the Justice Department, Judge Dolly M. Gee... held that there was no basis to amend a longstanding consent decree that requires children to be released to licensed care programs within 20 days."

I broke down how the latest GOP budget resolution shreds the safety net and attacks the critical benefits that have been earned by hard-working Americans. 		It's the Republican 3-step dance in action: Cut taxes for the rich, balloon the deficit, slash programs like Medicare. https://t.co/vqrnSIuJox

Let's also be clear the order Trump intends to sign will likely still continue family separation &amp; will almost certainly allow for indefinite detention of families. That's both illegal &amp; cruel and inhumane. So, no celebration just yet. Hope I'm wrong but not holding my breath.
Let's be clear: Trump does not need to sign an executive order to stop the cruel policy of separating children from their parents. All he  needs to do is pick up the phone and call Sessions and Neilson and tell them to stop. He started it, he can end it with  a phone call.
Thank you  @united. Every corporation should ensure that their technology, labor and resources are not used to separate children from their parents. https://t.co/AQOIHTLweB
The president wants to use children to secure more extreme anti-immigrant provisions. 		We won't have it. If you want Congress to pass a bill, the Keep Families Together Act is what we should be signing.
I think the American people's hearts are breaking. People are standing up across the country. 		@realDonaldTrump, we don't need legislation or even an executive order. Pick up the phone and tell @SecNielsen to STOP THE ABUSE. We refuse to hold children hostage.
The mothers I met with talked about being deceived and not having a chance to say goodbye to their own kids. All of them are looking for a better life for our families and our children. 		When the president tries to equate these people with criminals, he is not telling the truth. https://t.co/aU3QXXBuDb

This is a country that should value our children. Instead, @realdonaldtrump is holding kids in cages and tent cities at the border.		He has chosen to take this democracy to its very bottom. He must end the family separation crisis he created NOW. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/UfFQABAWU1

Join me on June 30th to March in support of families who’ve been separated at the border.
.@SecNielsen told a lot of lies this week. She made it sound like kids separated from families are at a summer camp. This is in complete contradiction to what is ACTUALLY happening. #EndFamilySeparation
This is a problem that @realDonaldTrump created, and it’s a problem that HE can fix TODAY.
The Ryan bill is not a moderate Bill. It doesn’t fix the problem at the border. It allows indefinite family detention. It contains a whole host of problematic provisions. It’s still an anti-immigrant bill.
I know there are mothers and fathers on the other side of the aisle. Republicans must speak up. They need to say something.
Many families that have been separated are asylum seekers. We cannot, should not treat them like criminals. They are escaping violence, looking for a safe place to build a life for their children.
Going on @bpshow NOW to talk about @realDonaldTrump’s inhumane and cruel family separation policy. #EndFamilySeparation
