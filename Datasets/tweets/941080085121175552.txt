After thorough consideration, I have concluded that Mr. Barr is qualified for the position &amp; his record strongly suggests he will exercise independent judgment &amp; uphold the best interests of the DoJ. I will vote to confirm Mr. Barr as AG of the United States.
Finally, in my conversation w/ Mr. Barr, I stressed how important the DoJ‚Äôs civil rights functions are to me &amp; the people of Alabama. Mr. Barr assured me of his commitment to protecting civil rights, including the vigorous enforcement of voting rights protections.
Some have expressed concerns about Mr. Barr‚Äôs views of executive power, which frankly are much more expansive than my own. In his hearing &amp; in my conversation w/him, he reiterated that he believes no one -- including the President of the United States -- is above the law.
As a former US Attorney, I believe the most important responsibility of an AG l is to uphold the rule of law &amp; to do so w/a commitment to transparency &amp; independence. We live in deeply divided times, but it is in precisely this environment that these principles are critical.
I have spent nearly two months examining Mr. Barr‚Äôs record, watching his hearings, and listening to &amp; considering the input of my constituents &amp; leaders in the justice community. I have spoken with Mr. Barr and asked him some tough questions of my own.

This morning, I sent a letter to the Int'l Trade Commission asking to testify at its July 17 hearing on newsprint tariffs that are hurting our local community newspapers. In AL, these small papers remain at the heart of their communities and we can't afford to lose them.
We have a responsibility to put pressure at the state and federal level on payday lenders who are engaging in predatory tactics. But we also need to provide low income communities with the tools to lift themselves out of poverty like raising the minimum wage. #BGOVInSite
Any conversation about infrastructure has to start with broadband. For rural communities, high speed internet has the ability to change their outcomes on health care, education, and attracting job creation. #BGOVInSite
Alabama did not expand Medicaid because of politics. We've got to get health care to place that is not governed by politics because our rural communities are in desperate need for coverage. #BGOVInSite
We got to start changing the narrative when we talk about guns. If we can get to a place where we're having a conversation, rather than an argument, we can find common ground. #BGOVInSite
On #TaxCutsandJobsAct: In the long-term, if those deficits are real and impacting our economy, I'm afraid that folks are going to try and cut domestic programs. #BGOVInSite
Education as a public official is a two way street. You have to do more than tell you're constituents what you're doing, you have to listen to them and the issues they're facing. #BGOVInSite

Finally, I am grateful for the capable service of the Alabama airmen who supported this mission in Syria last night. To them and their families, I share my continued appreciation for their sacrifices on behalf of all of us
and to do so with the assistance of our allies.  It is my hope, as General Mattis stated last night, that Assad gets the message this time and that further action, which should be done with Congressional approval, will not be necessary.
Bashar al-Assad's repeated use of chemical weapons on innocent civilians -- so many of them children -- was an atrocity and must be stopped.  I fully support the President‚Äôs actions last night to strategically target Assad‚Äôs capacity to use chemical weapons

We can seize this moment by changing the conversation and our country.  		Let‚Äôs start a productive dialogue and work toward a comprehensive bill that includes ideas we should be able to agree on. There are already a half-dozen proposals in the Senate that have bipartisan support.
I stand in that moment now.  So do you.  So does our country. I believe we have finally reached a tipping point regarding gun violence now.
I wish I could turn back time and do something that would have prevented it altogether. Had I or anyone else had that moment, it might very well be one of those girls giving this speech today and not me.
My career has been defined by prosecuting the killers of children. It was September 15, 1963, when a bomb placed outside the ladies lounge window of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham exploded, killing four beautiful young girls.
https://t.co/ZGtPDApVmU
While I know that guns and gun control are difficult issues for this country, I can tell you they‚Äôre complicated for me, too. But as a Senator, a member of the legislative branch, I have many obligations. And I believe that the 1st obligation of gov't is to protect its citizens.
Those two concepts are not mutually exclusive.
We must acknowledge the deadly consequences that can follow when a gun is in the wrong hands, but also recognize and respect the freedom to own and enjoy guns by law-abiding citizens as guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the Constitution.
In the wake of yet another mass shooting, and the rising voices of young people across the country, it is our responsibility ‚Äì our duty ‚Äì to have a serious discussion about guns and gun safety.  But that conversation has to be two-fold.
Today, I rise to speak about an issue that has evaded broad bipartisan discussions and moderation -- an issue where folks quickly take sides and criticize anyone who disagrees. https://t.co/WGRGzUDpbw

I have always worked to have dialogues, not monologues. My advice to you, is to do the same. You can't find common ground and you can't find solutions, if you're unwillingly to engage with folks who might not agree with you.
It's so exciting to see the engagement happening across Alabama &amp; our country. We need your perspective &amp; your enthusiasm. - AL YMCA Youth Legislature. https://t.co/yl77zQb0dE
Nothing better than spending an afternoon meeting with a whole room full of Alabama's future leaders at the YMCA Youth Legislature. https://t.co/a3MRG3iYfz
Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville is home to thousands of men and women working in national defense, federal law enforcement and, yes, even space exploration.

You have to meet with your constituents where they are ‚Äî and sometimes that means you just need to take a knee. These kids are participating in a federally funded childcare program at @NWSCC that supports their parents as they‚Äôre working to earn a degree. https://t.co/TwXboxhFgp

Last fall, DHS alerted 21 states that their elections were targeted by hackers in 2016. Our adversaries, including Russia, will not stop trying to influence our elections. We must accept this reality and take steps to protect our 2018 elections immediately.
What we should understand is that this isn't just about attempts to tamper with election equipment and alter ballots. It's about Russia's intention to manipulate public opinion, create chaos, and undermine the values that we share as Americans‚Äîto make us doubt our institutions.
If you care about election integrity, this should absolutely get your attention. https://t.co/VFu7gxRChR
I'll be visiting with folks about issues that impact our communities -- from healthcare and education to jobs and defense.
Just announced my first official week-long state tour in Alabama. I'm looking forward to getting out to Mobile, Selma, Centreville, Birmingham, Muscle Shoals, Huntsville, and Montgomery next week. Follow along on Twitter!
Thanks to Alabamian @RyanKinder for stopping by this week to talk about the importance of a bipartisan bill I‚Äôve co-sponsored to protect songwriters and ensure we get more great music like this for years to come. #StandWithSongwriters https://t.co/hrADGcxcNR
Bipartisanship is a word that folks like to say, but it‚Äôs tough work. We're committed to making positive change &amp; bringing more of our colleagues to the table for the tough conversations ahead. Read my full statement here: https://t.co/b7T5x2sfaD
This resolution honors their sacrifice, their commitment to economic equality, and their often overlooked, but essential, contribution to the Civil Rights Movement.
In 1968, after enduring years of poor working conditions and low pay, 1,300 African-American sanitation workers in Memphis risked their livelihoods and joined together to put an end to the discrimination they faced every day at their jobs.
Right now on the Senate floor, I'm joining @SenAlexander to introduce a resolution commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Memphis sanitation workers' strike -- an historic event in the Civil Rights Movement.
This is bipartisanship at work. Together, our Common Sense Coalition has proposed a bill that will both protect DREAMers and strengthen our borders. This group gives me hope that we can continue to work together on the many more challenges we face. https://t.co/esyGkDR7Pj
It was great to meet with you, @DrMichaelLomax. HBCUs are a core part of our higher education system in Alabama and I look forward to working with you to make sure they have the tools to succeed. https://t.co/XSTOnHMJUL

The women who survived Rob Porter's abuse were brave to speak up. Like others who have come forward, they've inspired women who have felt ashamed and scared to share the truth. Now, it‚Äôs on the White House to step up and show leadership in protecting victims of assault.
Abusers have to be held accountable and this is a moment where the White House can send that message loud and clear. I hope they step up, but as a Congress &amp; as a nation, we cannot look the other way. Today, victims have found their voices and I stand w/them to call for justice.
Great speaking with my friend @JeffWVTM13 today about my 1st month in office &amp; working across the aisle to pass legislation that will help Alabama. https://t.co/vneBqAQzeM

The House Defense funding bill would cost major employers in Alabama 100s of millions of dollars &amp; could lead to layoffs. By rejecting that bill today, and as a result of yesterday's Senate compromise, we can take action on the Senate's bipartisan bill, which is better for AL.
Great meeting today with Chris Reynolds &amp; Stephen Ciccone from Toyota to discuss the new Huntsville plant &amp; how we can work together to continue growing Alabama‚Äôs booming automotive sector. https://t.co/63FTnEGmgk
This long-term funding agreement is important because it shows that bipartisan efforts work ‚Äì and they are the only way we can move forward together to solve our biggest challenges. @mynbc15 https://t.co/kzgrmPDXct
This is a strong, bipartisan bill that invests Alabama‚Äôs priorities like community health centers, #CHIP &amp; our military. I encourage my colleagues in the House to pass it, so we can move forward together to address the important challenges we face. 	https://t.co/DLwA3maT5R

Great to meet with the AL Primary Health Care Association today to discuss the importance of extending funding for our vital community health centers. Funding expired in Sept 2017 ‚Äî without it, 350k Alabamians are at risk of losing their access to care. https://t.co/jUNLYMQuvY
Last night, I called on Senate leadership to extend funding for our Community Health Centers. If Congress doesn't act, 350k Alabamians are at risk of losing access to health care: https://t.co/Q4vDUmg1SB https://t.co/AQrNn2UE6h

Rosa Parks‚Äô legacy lives in the progress that we‚Äôve seen in our country. But if she was with us today, she would remind us there is still much that remains to be done. We can honor her and all those who fought for equality by continuing that work. #RosaParksDay #BlackHistoryMonth

Today I called on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to hold a vote on a measure to ensure U.S. military Service-members and their families will continue to be paid during the federal government shutdown: https://t.co/S5KFMQAE6W
Around the world and here at home, our military and their families continue to serve during the #shutdown. @SenateMajLdr should stop blocking @clairecmc‚Äôs bill -which I cosponsored - that ensures they will still get paid for their sacrifices on our behalf.
A functioning American government isn‚Äôt negotiable. We need to find common ground to end this shutdown immediately. I‚Äôll be working every day until we get the gov‚Äôt running again, so we can get back to the important work our constituents expect us to do.
"Because of CHIP and the many families in Alabama and around our country that would be put in jeopardy by a government shutdown, I felt compelled to vote yes." -Senator Jones statement on the federal government shutdown. https://t.co/a9YJhVJG9G
