@LiberalDanRadio @JimFrancisLA01 @tammyforla Someone. In the event of a December runoff between Scalise and Francis, it's the kind of negatively that turns off potential volunteers, and ruins party unity. (10)
@LiberalDanRadio @JimFrancisLA01 @tammyforla A woman he believes is responsible for attacking his campaign. It's incredibly negative. In a social media world where people are getting doxed all the time, I found it uncouth, and unprofessional, and dangerous for a congressional candidate to go on the offense by naming (9)
@LiberalDanRadio @JimFrancisLA01 @tammyforla Positioned to take on Scalise in a December runoff. It just shows an median expected vote share. To me, that's misleading. Couple that with the statement posted by Francis on 08.16, where he not only plays a the game he's decrying in the statement, but also names (8)
@LiberalDanRadio @JimFrancisLA01 @tammyforla Information you see. It says Francis and Savoie are about 1% apart in the expected vote share. There's no article specifically mentioning Francis as a better candidate than Savoie, there's no write up about our Jungle Primary system and how Francis would be better (7)
@LiberalDanRadio @JimFrancisLA01 @tammyforla As many Democrats out to vote in November to get Scalise below the 50% threshold. Something I've heard her say both time I've heard her asked the question. And something I've heard all the volunteer coordinators echo. When the 538 House Model came out, I saw the same (6)
@LiberalDanRadio @JimFrancisLA01 @tammyforla so I attended a postcard writing event. At that event, when Savoie was asked about Francis, she was very honest that she wasn't going to attack his campaign because there was always a chance that he'd be the Dem in a runoff against Scalise, and our primary goal was to get (5)
@LiberalDanRadio @JimFrancisLA01 @tammyforla I was still all in, and ready to go when Savoie announced. The Savoie facebook page (I'm new to Twitter) announced an event at a local group, and said to come out to hear her speak. I really liked what she had to say. Their campaign was eager for volunteers (4)
@LiberalDanRadio @JimFrancisLA01 @tammyforla I signed up for emails, and kept checking the facebook page for events I could attend to meet the candidate, see if I liked him, and volunteer. But I could never find an event on the Southshore, or something to attend when I was on the Northshore visiting family (3)
@LiberalDanRadio @JimFrancisLA01 @tammyforla Any campaign that has a chance to unseat Scalise. I know Francis announced first, and I got really excited, because I wanted to turn my talk into action, and wanted to be able to tell myself I was doing as much as possible to bring a blue wave to SeLA. (2)
@LiberalDanRadio @JimFrancisLA01 @tammyforla I don't work for the Savoie campaign (full disclosure, I have volunteered), so I can't speak to their media strategy. But back to my original tweet, I'm politically minded, I volunteer and donate money to campaigns I'm excited about,  and I wanted to be part of  (1)
