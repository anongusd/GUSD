@Drjimrugby @clearfieldking @USATODAY @CBP I'm not saying I know more than any agent. I'm saying that child welfare experts and juvenile judges with experience in this field may know more about identifying child abuse than agents who receive no training on child trauma.
@clearfieldking @USATODAY @CBP Correct. But these are cases where the parent is NOT a felon, yet an agent decides unilaterally that the parent may be “a danger” to that child.
@clearfieldking @USATODAY @CBP When migrants are arrested, it’s for an immigration violation and those families are, by law, housed together in family detention centers. Separating those families is a completely different step.
@edhaskl @USATODAY @CBP But they can only do so on an emergency basis, for a period of up to 24-72 hours, before a judge must approve the separation. There is no such oversight for @CBP.
The Trump administration is still separating migrant families when @CBP agents, on their own, determine a parent poses a danger to their child. The process is “brief and expeditious in nature” with no oversight required and no appeal allowed. https://t.co/Nu5BfAS6QI via @usatoday

Judge Sabraw rejects Trump administration request to make @ACLU responsible for finding parents who were deported after being separated from their children. ACLU and others can help, but "the government has the sole burden and responsibility and obligation to make this happen."
Judge Sabraw angry with Trump administration for not having a plan in place to find deported parents: “The reality is that for every parent who is not located, there will be a permanently orphaned child, and that is 100% the responsibility of the administration.”
@mkpersyn They overlap. The deported parents must still be reunited, the judge is just giving the government more time to complete those.

DOJ invites Judge Sabraw to tour a facility holding minors. Sabraw says he appreciates the offer, but declines. "The concern that has been at issue is simply the passage of time. No matter how nice the environment is, it's the act of separation from a parent...that matters."
Sabraw not letting up on @HHSGov, says the agency "is failing" to reunite children with their parents and would rather "hold children for months" through a "process of delaying" that goes against his order to complete all reunifications by July 26.
Judge Sabraw is scolding @HHSGov official who claimed that Sabraw's order to speed up reunifications is putting kids at risk. Sabraw calls those statements "deeply troubling" and "completely unhelpful" since it was the government that separated the families in the first place.
@terib3294 @USATODAY Bias? There was a request for the judge to punish the government. The judge did not rule on that request. We reported that. We also included, as the first quote in the story, the judge's FULL comments praising the government for its actions thus far.

U.S. embassy officials pleaded with Trump admin to maintain TPS, according to a report on diplomatic cables prepared by Senate Dems. The Trump administration overruled those objections and has now ended the program for 98% of participants. https://t.co/C1pi0xw37A via @usatoday
@CrespoSusie @BigBadWolfGboro @luvscoconut @KayaColor @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov @USATODAY The TPS program does not allow them to apply for citizenship, no matter if they lived here 5 years or 20. Their only options to become citizens were the traditional ones - marrying a U.S. citizen, naturalizing through children, etc. Very few had those options.
@BigBadWolfGboro @luvscoconut @CrespoSusie @KayaColor @realDonaldTrump @DHSgov @USATODAY Just to be clear on one point, these 57,000 Hondurans (and all 317,000 people in the program) have been here completely legally for all these years. They are not undocumented immigrants. They have not been hiding.

@frautuck @KatyTurNBC @USATODAY Just to be clear, that was a one-month snapshot. The broader trend paints a very different story. Last year, 303,916 immigrants were caught crossing the SW border, the lowest number since 1971. So far this year, those numbers are down even further, dropping another 13%.
UGH! It's going to be another busy, above average hurricane season with up to 14 named tropical storms and 7 hurricanes, meteorologists say https://t.co/ckVg5ywZ6T via @usatoday @usatodayweather
As @realDonaldTrump considers deploying National Guard, @DHSgov releases the number of immigrants caught along SW border in March: 37,393. That's the highest monthly total since Dec. 2016. Apprehensions during first 6 months of FY18 still down 13% from same time period in FY17.
@matthewjdowd @demeralda @SecNielsen Haha. OK. But hey, you got some links to play around with if you're bored.
@matthewjdowd @demeralda @SecNielsen Piecing together overall apprehension data for FY 2018 is spread out across different Border Patrol data sets, but this page can get you started. It shows how unaccompanied minor crossings are down 36% and family unit apprehensions are down 46%. https://t.co/q6Wb3zZkbd
@matthewjdowd @demeralda @SecNielsen All data comes straight from Border Patrol. This can get you started, shows apprehension totals for every year going back decades: https://t.co/xzHG5o8DWo Shows that FY 2017 saw the fewest apprehensions since 1971.
@ljreina There is no reliable data on actual border crossings - if you don't catch them, you can't count them. That's why apprehensions have always been the best measure of traffic along the border.
DHS @SecNielsen said "we've recently seen the numbers of illegal border crossings rise."		Context: In FY 17, US recorded lowest number of border apprehensions (303,916) in 47 years. In the first 5 months of FY 18, the numbers are even lower, down 27% from same period in FY 17.

@JessicaV_CIS Yes, dozens of Texas sheriffs signed on to the letter. My point was that no Texas sheriffs whose counties share a border with Mexico signed on.
@MarkSKrikorian I see your point. Just providing some context from the sheriffs who monitor and patrol the actual, physical border.
400 sheriffs sign letter demanding a border wall. But it's important to note: only 3 of 23 sheriffs whose counties share a border with Mexico signed onto the letter. All 3 from Arizona. None from California, New Mexico or Texas. https://t.co/yhhbKox8bO

Paying for the wall? Trump orders all executive agencies to compile a list of all economic aid given to Mexico over the last 5 years.
Trump orders that undocumented immigrants are detained until their cases are resolved or they're deported. Ends "catch and release."
Trump orders administration to "expedite determinations of apprehended individuals' claims of eligibility to remain in the United States."
Creates a DHS office to provide "proactive, timely, adequate, and professional services" to victims of crimes committed by undocumented.
Trump orders DHS to create and publicize a weekly report listing all "criminal actions committed by aliens."
Will target undocumented immigrants with criminal records and those who "have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense."
Trump makes it policy to "ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the (US)...against all removable aliens." Emphasis: all.

Castro lists human rights Cuba complies with: free health care, free education, equal pay for women.
Castro asked about human right concerns in Cuba, answers, "What country complies with all human rights? None."
Obama: "The embargo is going to end. The path that we’re on will continue beyond my administration. The reason is logic."
Castro denies that Cuba detains political prisoners: "If there a political prisoners, before the end of the night, they will be released."
Castro asked why Cuba has political prisoners. He responds "What political prisoners? Give me the name or names."
Obama says Cuba's human rights record will continue being an "impediment" and "irritant" between Cubans and Cuban-Americans.
Obama: "The human impulse toward freedom, the freedom that Jose Marti talked about, we think is a universal longing."
Obama: "As you say here in Cuba: Echar para delante. Despite the difficulties, we will continue to move forward.
Obama calls on Castro to allow U.S. companies to hire Cuban citizens directly, rather than going through Cuban government.
Obama: "We believe that when we share our deepest beliefs and ideas with an attitude of mutual respect that we can both learn."
Obama directly addressing Cuba's record on human rights, freedom of speech and religion, and the right of its people to peaceably assemble.
Obama to exile community in U.S.: "More Cuban-Americans are coming home. For many, this is a time of new hope for a new future."
Obama in Cuba: "For more than half a century the sight of a U.S. president in Havana would have been unimaginable. But this is a new day."
Raul Castro: "Destroying a bridge is easy and requires little time. Rebuilding it solidly is a job that is longer and more difficult."
Castro says "profound differences exist between our countries that will not disappear" including political systems and human rights.
Castro: "We consider that civil rights, political, economic, social and cultural are indivisible, interdependent and universal."
Raul Castro: "The blockade is the most important obstacle to the economic development and well-being of the Cuban people."
Castro speaking next to Obama: "The recent measures adopted by his government are positive, but not sufficient."
Castro opens press conference with Obama: "This cooperation is beneficial to Cuba and the United States, but also for our hemisphere."

President Obama details his plan. What should immigrants who qualify do next? http://t.co/5GoxDzpt7Y via @USATODAY by @williammwelch
.@MarkSKrikorian: "Of course it's amnesty. It's not just 'we're not going to deport you' - it's work permits."
.@JMurguia_NCLR: "This action is a victory for the president...millions of American families and workers...our country and...common sense."
.@GovBrewer: "President Obama undermines our Constitution and erodes the fundamental principles upon which America was built."
.@ChuckGrassley "The President is missing a big opportunity to enact real reform, and instead he’s poisoning the well for future action."
.@RepGoodlatte "President Obama is going rogue, doubling-down, and driving full speed towards a constitutional crisis."
Obama: "Scripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger, for we know the heart of a stranger – we were strangers once, too."
Obama: "This debate is about something bigger. It’s about who we are as a country, and who we want to be for future generations."
Obama: "Congress certainly shouldn’t shut down our government again just because we disagree on this.  Americans are tired of gridlock."
Obama says his actions were "taken by every single Republican President and every single Democratic President for the past half century."
.@BarackObama: "I know some of the critics of this action call it amnesty.  Well, it’s not. What I'm describing is called accountability."
Obama: "It does not grant citizenship, or the right to stay here permanently, or offer the same benefits that citizens receive."
Obama to undocumented immigrants who are parents of U.S. citizens and LPRs: "You can come out of the shadows and get right with the law."
.@BarackObama: "As my predecessor, President Bush, once put it: 'They are a part of American life.'”
Obama: "Let’s be honest – tracking down, rounding up, and deporting millions of people isn’t realistic."
Obama: "I will make it easier and faster for high-skilled immigrants, graduates, and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy."
O: "There are actions I have the legal authority to take as President...that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just."
.@BarackObama: "I continue to believe that the best way to solve this problem is by working together to pass that kind of common sense law."
Here we go. Obama getting started on his immigration speech. Starting with a nod to America's immigrant history.
