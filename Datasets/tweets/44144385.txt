Tough-minded win for the Spartans to put them in the driver's seat again in the Big Ten. Played the way they had to on the road. Only two second-half turnovers, six for the game. Shot 18-for-21 from the line in the second half, too.

Seven first-half turnovers for Michigan. MSU at 1.39 PPP with lots of easy buckets -- layups and poor close-outs at 3-point line. Winston and Simpson both never left the court. Michigan will need a much better second half from Jordan Poole.

Charles Matthews hobbled through last couple possessions. Getting right ankle checked on the bench now.
Michigan closing out on 3-point line the way they did in a couple of their losses this season. Can't do that against McQuaid in particular.

New school record for Ohio State against Michigan. Previous high was 50 points in '61 and '68
Urban probably should -- and will -- go for two after Ohio State's next TD.
Patterson just took a couple pain pills and had knee taped/braced and looks like he'll try to keep playing.
Patterson clutching at his right leg/knee? after getting dragged down on that play
Ohio State has scored 50 twice against Michigan, including 50 years ago yesterday. At 48 and counting today with almost a full quarter left to go ...
I think Michigan's defense misses Devin Bush.
And there's the throwaway INT from Patterson to bury Michigan.
Two TDs and a blocked punt for the true freshman Chris Olave. Welcome to the rivalry, kid.
Michigan's special teams returns the favor.
Devin Bush headed to locker room. Looks like left leg. Not putting any weight on it.
Ohio State running some tempo on this drive and just picked up an easy first down with Michigan defense not close to set on snap.
Season-high passing yards allowed for Michigan until today: 209 vs. SMU	Ohio State with 222 passing yards in the first half
Scratch that. They had 13 on the field when Ohio State called timeout.
Ohio State calls timeout, spares Michigan another illegal substitution penalty because they had 12 men on the field again.
Two weeks in a row for Ohio State with a KO return gaffe. But my goodness, this game just lurched.
Michigan needed somebody to make a play. Nico Collins just made one. Terrific read and throw by Patterson on the play, too.
Metellus screaming at Kinnel after that coverage mixup on the TD.
Pylon cam confirms he stayed inbounds. Two TDs for Olave, the true freshman WR from California. He'd caught five passes all season.
Michigan can't say they're not getting the calls today.

One more from Lisa Larsen Rainsberger on @des_linden making history today: "And she drinks beer and bourbon. I mean, how can you not like that?" Linden said at her post-race presser she may stick to beer tonight. Whiskey "might be too aggressive," she laughed. Soon, though. Soon.
More from Rainsberger, whose daughter is a sophomore cross-country star at Univ. of Oregon, on the significance of an American woman winning Boston again amid a U.S. distance-running surge: "It‚Äôs going to plant that seed of hope and possibility."
Talked to Lisa Larsen Rainsberger earlier today. Thrilled to no longer be the last American woman to win the Boston Marathon, a title she'd held since '85, and happy to pass the torch to @des_linden. ("She's a Michigan girl!") Also "because she epitomizes all that I believe in."
Huge day for the Hansons-Brooks team with Des Linden's win in Boston, obviously. But they also had a podium finish on men's side with Biwott, a recent addition to the team last year.

Matthews with a tongue wag at the bench after that last bucket. Simpson to the rack. Robinson with a three. Order restored for Michigan. Matthews has been terrific, but Simpson such a rock for this team.
It's working, too. Not sure what took them so long ... https://t.co/6p5ztx9Uw0
Beilein just put his head in his hand after that last Matthews miss. Michigan 3-for-18 from 3 in this one. Plenty of open looks.
Michigan defense stifling right now. Scoreless drought at 5:17 for FSU. Wolverines finally getting some buckets in transition out of it, too.
RT @BFQuinn: Duncan Robinson checking in at this timeout. He, along with the entire Michigan bench, is scoreless.		The Wolverines are 27-0‚Ä¶
Big cheers from the Michigan crowd here as Rudy Tomjanovich and Desmond Howard are shown on the video boards.
Michigan made 7 shots in the first half and leads by 1. Go figure.
After 16 minutes, 16 made FGs and 17 turnovers combined. Pretty messy half. Leonard Hamilton's "junkyard dogs" OK with that.
FSU shooting 50 percent but the 41 percent turnover rate a little problematic. Michigan not much better, though, and Wagner just yelled at Robinson after outlet miscue, "Why are you running away from me, man?" Simpson came over and told him to relax. Happens at least once a game.
As expected, FSU's length is much more athletic than A&amp;M's and they're doing a good job on close-outs here in the first half. Michigan need to attack the basket more, like it has last two trips.
Gonna be flagrant 1 on Duncan there
Charles Matthews is having himself an NCAA tournament.
Two fouls early for Chris Kumadje, but I'm not sure how much longer FSU could stick with that lineup anyway. He's a matchup waiting to be exploited for this Michigan team.

Well then.
If this goes to OT, just nobody tell the refs, OK?
We're at a healthy 34 personal fouls now, 17 apiece. Ump show.
Michigan's gonna have to make their FTs to win this game. Teske doing his part here down the stretch.
Michigan now 6-for-27 from 3-point line after that last possession.
Simmons screwed up that last play, led to turnover. Then Gray drains a three at the other end, after taking Matthews to the hole the previous trip. Now you see the value of Simpson to this team. He's coming back in.
Going to be a real test of composure here. Michigan players getting understandably frustrated with all these whistles. Beilein braced 'em for this but it's even worse than advertised.

RT @mulho2mj: For all of you watching at home, screaming lady is a member of the Michigan band.
That's what Beilein was asking for from his team, MAAR fighting through initial contact and getting to the rim on the drive.
Beilein screaming at Simpson for that last drive attempt. "What are you doing?!?!"
RT @nickbaumgardner: Simpson is Simpsoning.
You get the idea.
And that.
Like that.
Houston's one of the nation's better 2-point defenses. Michigan's 0-for-5 from 3 to start. Not a great recipe. This may be a night where Duncan Robinson provides a lift. He just checked in.
Looks like Simpson will get first crack at guarding Rob Gray tonight. Assume Abdur-Rahkman will get his chances as well, though.
You will be able to hear U-M asst Luke Yaklich loud and clear on broadcast tonight, I'm guessing. Arena barely half-full for late game with most KU fans having exited.
This is the other crew here in Wichita, FWIW. Not the one Michigan had Thursday night. https://t.co/vmro48TQi1
Official tip is 10:02 p.m. ET for Michigan-Houston
Kansas coaches were worried about Seton Hall's Angel Delgado. Maybe not worried enough. Dominican big man has 24 points, 20 rebounds, 5 assists, and the Pirates are only down 4 with 4 mins to play.
Seton Hall not backing down here, but bad news for rest of Midwest Regional: Kansas 7-foot center Udoka Azubuike looks healthy enough to be a major factor rest of way. First game back from knee injury and Jayhawks are +22 in his 17 mins on floor.

@joerexrode Sigh.
Michigan still had a foul to give in final minute. Think there was some thought of using it before Montana hit that last three. Still, U-M up 3 at half after an ugly start.
@mboyeast agreed
Check that, he's going to sub Brooks in for Simmons.
Yaklich just convinced Beilein to bring Simpson back from scorer's table and leave Simmons in.
Wolverines getting a big lift from Jaaron Simmons. Simpson about to check back in with two fouls though.
Refs are a bit of a mess early, too, obviously.
Wolverines' ball-screen D a bit of a mess here early. Wagner just came over to talk to Beilein during last stoppage to try to get something figured out.
