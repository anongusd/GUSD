@bmoschetti @Sleepwalker58 @adamlambert I completely agree. It is like buried treasure. My hope is a re-release w/the proper promo/support.
@Sleepwalker58 @adamlambert @wbr  Yes! A talented artist deserves the support of a reputable label. TY @wbr &amp; @adamlambert #TheOriginalHigh
@Sleepwalker58 @adamlambert It is. There were some hits on that album. The label did not provide the support/promo it deserved. üëè for Adam!

@fromthegreyfort TY so much!
I rarely post anything personal but my husband (whom I am madly in love with) has brawn, beauty &amp; brains #luckygirl http://t.co/GNuhi0R0TL
@adamlambert has chiseled good looks. His face is a work of art. I cannot get enough of these recent pics. http://t.co/ZyI8E3GpZa
@adamlambert  Absolutely loved that performance. Vocals of course were great, but your moves...they were rockin' too!
A recent quote about @adamlambert by the always eloquent, intelligent and talented @DrBrianMay http://t.co/Kv9x8UtSys
@adamlambert Glad you're home after a working (&amp; some pleasure) trip. Sweden must be a beautiful place to visit. Welcome back to CA.
I admire genuine ppl that speak their minds, but do so with respect. Adam conveys how he feels &amp; does it with class, courage &amp; kindness.

@adamlambert 's new Twitter profile photo and header is the essence of cool. He couldn't have chosen better photos to epitomize his essence.
@adamlambert One of the best pics! And that is saying a lot since there are many. Could never find a better looking man in entertainment
@adamlambert You are one beautiful man. Your appeal is not just your talent, charisma &amp; personality but also your good looks.
The thing that brings me back to Twitter when I think I have given it up forever: the kind, thoughtful &amp; beautiful people (&amp; fans of A).
Never give up on your dreams regardless of what they are. There is always hope. http://t.co/oZVDxCNkBO
@adamlambert Your honesty is what attracts you to many fans. It is refreshing. We are supportive and ready for Era #3.
@adamlambert Here's an original question for you. What comedian or funny person makes you laugh? http://t.co/CH3L3ZMS4K
@bmoschetti @adamlambert Yes, can't underestimate those sexy dance moves. ;) TY.
@adamlambert That was the closest thing we have had to a Twitter party in a while. TY.
I feel @adamlambert could add "dancer" to his bio. The man has some moves! Adam, you have proven what a multi-talented individual you are.
@TeamHLN Thx so much for your reply (just one of the reasons I love HLN). That was a wonderful discovery yesterday. Appreciate all you do!
@TeamHLN We just noticed that HLN is now HD on our Cox cable station in Phoenix. So excited to see one of our fav channels in HD! TY!

@Cazglambert_ @adamlambert TY hon. And I hope what you want comes true when you see him again. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Before I leave this earth, I want either a reply, retweet or to meet my idol @adamlambert and tell him how much he means to me.
@Think1025 @RobinInSA I hope he does too! And my other dream...a number #1 album again  with massive sales w/the right label &amp; promo.
@Glambertgirl69 I hope so. It should generate more sales for his solo career. It feels like this time it will. No mo disappointments plz ;)
@RobinInSA You have a much better chance than I do. I prefer balcony to SRO in LV so I'm limited. l'll try though! Good luck, my friend! üòò
With all this success Adam has, hope it translates into major record sells for album #3. No one deserves it more. One note tells you that.
@Glambertgirl69 TY hon ;)
I feel that even if we don't get tix to Queenbert shows, there's still a poss that more dates will open up &amp; still have A's solo concerts.
@SusanWesterfeld @wismiss3 TY! Yes, this is his time for a change to get his due.
@Think1025 @RobinInSA I am trying for Vegas but do not want GA so I am going for the balcony. Dallas is my hometown but not ready to go.
@RobinInSA Me too! Excited &amp; happy for this very deserving gift to the world! Thought about Dallas/CA. Going for Vegas, glamsis! Good lucküôèüòò
@wismiss3 He sure has! This is going to be a phenomenal year for him.
@musicagain333 Yep, only one worth the time, energy and money. ;)
I've berted more than usual today. ;) Adam is the only one in the entertainment world I would devote so much of my time to. What a man! ‚ù§Ô∏è
@Krystal_Klearz Yes, that would be the best scenario. Highly advertised and sold out tour with the help from Brian &amp; Roger's PR team.
This time, Adam &amp; Queen better be top entertainment news in the states. Want the major publicity machine cranked for this greatness on stage
@Cazglambert_ I bet. When you love &amp; admire him the way we do, crumbling is par for the course ;)
@adamlambert - perfect one to front Queen. His work reveals incomparable/electrifying vocals, personality &amp; moves. Born performer &amp; artist.
@Cazglambert_ That sounds like the perfect thing to say. You were prob fine. ;) I just hope I can get the words out and maybe get a smile.
@Cazglambert_ Must be hard 2 do when you're in the presence of that man! Hope 2 remain calm, say a few words, but I don't think it's easy ;)
@Cazglambert_ You got that right, kiddo! We are. Thankful.
@Cazglambert_ I'm jealous of u ;) You've had the pers touch - 1 on 1. Been to concerts but didn't meet/no RTs. A dream! No guarantee on tix.
@Cazglambert_ We are both lucky in different ways; yes.  Hope we can have it all though. I am greedy and want that for both of us ;)
@Cazglambert_ I wish I had what you have had, hon. But I understand your disappointment. I hope we both have it all one day. Luv ya lots xo
@I4Adam2 If we lived in the same area, we could go together. ;) Wish you lots of luck, my friend. Love ya.
@Cazglambert_ Hi hon. Don't forget you have met him &amp; had tons of re-tweets/replies. ;) I've had none of those :( Hope he expands to Oz :)‚ù§Ô∏è
@I4Adam2 Hope she can go with you. I just wonder if I'll  get tix - even pre-sale. They go very quickly. Let's keep our fingers crossed Mon!
@I4Adam2 Hello sweet lady! Adam excitement lately. ;)
TY for the answers to my question. I love the @adamlambert community of fans. I can always count on your kindness. Thanks again.
@fromthegreyfort It does. TY so much! Makes sense. I will try for the pre-sale for Vegas then.
@coptoit TY. Yes, I think I will check it out.
I have a question. I figured my smart Twitter buds will know. Will there be pre-sale tix for the Vegas shows? VIP is grayed out on them. Thx
@adamlambert picked up 1,650 followers yesterday! If you want to be entertained, excited and inspired by greatness - follow him.

TY all for the retweets, replies and favs in the last couple of months. I appreciate it and you. Our common bond is a remarkable thing.
@Cazglambert_ Just wanted to say hello to my beautiful friend. Thx for the fav.
@adamlambert You were incredible in last night's episode. Check out "Adam Lambert in Glee S05E09" on Vimeo http://t.co/YBJMFqpc4m #Vimeo
@6thsenseplus @fromthegreyfort We're in sync. It came as a surprise what he did to me. ;)
I never thought that I'd see someone on TV and it would forever change my existence. I maintain a balance but Adam def takes up my time ;)
@adamlambert Your appearance on @GLEEonFOX was fun to watch! You lit up the screen like you always do. Looked and sounded extraordinary.
@shadylady1031 @adamlambert That look was my fav, I must say.
@shadylady1031 @adamlambert One of my favorite performances too. As usual, he was the number one attraction.

@adamlambert TY for sharing, Adam. Lucky people that get to share your BD with you!
The Grammys has Bruno, Pharrell &amp; Nile receiving awards; all ppl Adam has worked with in the past. For me, it is bittersweet. 	Want it 4 A.
RT @RobinInSA: Next yr Adam could perform twice! Solo with his multi-nominated single &amp; with Queen (coming off their sold out US tour)! :) ‚Ä¶
I positively know that @adamlambert will not only perform at the Grammys one day but he will win not one but several in the years to come.
Watching the Grammys without Adam Lambert (best singer) is like watching the Oscars without Meryl Streep (best actress) there.
This face of @adamlambert is "naturally" perfect just the way it is. http://t.co/C91VeH38nb
@Cazglambert_ @RobinInSA Hey girl(s). Waves from Phoenix. :)

@adamlambert Your vocals are pure. You are the epitome of authentic, honest and real. Enjoyed the 5 year journey with you...
@Jadelle1 I bet he will. He loves change. I like it both ways but that certainly had us talking.
@Jadelle1 Yes, exactly. A different hairstyle with facial hair. He did look amazingly adorable. ;)

Twitter should be a forum to bring us together; not divide. For me, it was originally a place to be entertained, informed &amp; enlightened.
@Sweetfour4 Your last name fits you. I work full time - 3 days in ofc and 2 at home. Wish I could retire but not yet. Retirement sounds gr8.
@Sweetfour4  Exactly. She said I have no idea what she was going thru. Then she proceeded to be rude. She should have stayed off Twitter.
@Sweetfour4 I am glad. That's a relief. I work from home 2 days a week for now. Your Twitter handle fits you perfectly - sweet. ;)
@Sweetfour4 Sorry that happened. Hope my interference didn't make it worse. Just didn't like false accusations for such a kind person like u
@Sweetfour4 TY! Wonderful being off work today.
@Sweetfour4 No loss there. I unfollowed/blocked her. She unflwd me. There was no excuse for her behavior. She has probs. Yes, many kind ppl!
Another amazing quote by Martin Luther King, Jr. http://t.co/esyGN1NrOw
I will not let people be disrespected or mistreated whether it is my business or not. Adam's fans are for the most part kind &amp; thoughtful.
@Sweetfour4 You are a very kind person. TY for being so wonderful. Have a good week.
@Sweetfour4 @niecey_E Yes, you did the right thing. Chg your password. You are very welcome.

@RobinInSA Me too! Never felt this way about any performer in my life. I feel I know him tho I never met him; yet miss him so after a show.
@RobinInSA Like A, tough to name a fav but I like rock/blues part - different. I always loved TP &amp; Shady. Like u, withdrawals after concert.
@RobinInSA @CaroLambs it certainly is. Beautiful aesthetically &amp; beautifully written. It'd b fun to discuss, yes! W/AL &amp; DA - hours talking!
@CaroLambs @RobinInSA It is a remarkable show all right, Carol. @RobinInSA If we did that, we'd be up all night. So much to talk about. lol
@RobinInSA I will have to watch JF tomorrow night. DA ended at 10 pm. I am hooked 2! Didn't think it'd be "my cup of tea" but it's the best!
@RobinInSA Yes, DA is the best drama I have ever seen. Acting, editing, directing...What a coincidence that JF did that on his special. üòÑ
@RobinInSA OIC. We caught up on all DA (best show ever!) on Amazon steaming. Tonight will be the 1st real time show we watch. JK is funny. üòÄ
@RobinInSA I am going to watch both shows too. From one emotion to another. Cannot wait to see both shows! Your emoticons are cute like you.

The true fans of @adamlambert just want the best for him. Things we do or say come from a place of love. That is the essence of Adam -  LOVE
@Krystal_Klearz TY ;)
@Klddsml So it applies personally as well as A. ;)
I believe careers could be enhanced if certain elements r eliminated. 	Loyalty is admirable but a person has to do what is best for #1 too.
@LoveAdamsEyes You are amazing, sweetie. You and your tweets mean the world to many of us. Your love for Adam is evident &amp; we luv ya kiddo!
@LoveAdamsEyes I just want to say how much I admire you. You speak for many of us. Your honesty, intelligence and boldness are appreciated.

I seem to become a fan of anyone that is kind to Adam (celeb or not) because he deserves it &amp; it makes me happy. Nice of Britney to tweet A.
@Cazglambert_ TY. It is tough to find true friends. Thanks for being that for me too.
@I4Adam2 TY. Nice and quiet. Hope yours was good too. :)
@adamlambert You are a man of style and substance. And, you are the best live singer/entertainer/performer out there. That's the truth.
@Cazglambert_ Yes, I was unhappy to read that. It must be very difficult. Y'all have had a tough time of it. My best 2 your hub &amp; ur family.
@Cazglambert_ It was good. Hope yours was too. Looking forward to the new year. Just caught up on your tweets. Missed them. ;)
@Cazglambert_ And vice versa, my friend. xo
@Cazglambert_ TY for noticing. Love ya.
Adam is in one of my fav places - Vegas Baby! http://t.co/IVybdRbL1w
@Cazglambert_ Hi girl. Thx for the shoutout. Been off Twitter for a while.

Adam Lambert has 2,194,265 Twitter followers. In January, he should have 2.2 mil. Gaining popularity every day.
@Cazglambert_ TY hon. I wish TJ would say something to his fans to stop the madness. ;) I was thinking of you and all you have tried to do.
@LoveAdamsEyes I know it is a long shot but like you said, we can only hope.
@TommyJoeRatliff Since Adam is all about positivity/realness, seems a shame there's so much infighting/hate &amp; Adommy nonsense. Needs to end.
For the new year, it would really be great if the Adommy stuff, pics of A's past loves &amp; hate tweets to A ended. Adam = realness/positivity.
@I4Adam2 @adamlambert @digitaljournal Yes, well written.

It's cool that @adamlambert is celebrating his bro Neil's BD early. Adam will be in NV, MS &amp; OK in the next week.
@Cazglambert_ TY so much hon. Right back at ya! xo
@adamlambert You are one good looking man.
@GlamLawyer Yes, definitely. :)
@lillylane1962 TY! :)
@fromthegreyfort Yes, it goes both ways. True. ;)
I may be outnumbered but I like that Adam isn't tweeting much lately. That means he's busy w/ his career, family or friends. Private time.
@adamlambert You amazed me with your talent, looks &amp; voice in '09. But your charm, personality, generosity &amp; humor hooked me for life.
@sherryrose99 Cannot express how much that meant to me. It's a wonderful life, amazing friend.
@sherryrose99 TY for the inspirational graphics that I use so often on Twitter and for your support, advice &amp; friendship through 17 years.
@RobinInSA TY! And I have never seen that great pic.

@I4Adam2 I will. TY. Yes, some of the best pics of him showed up this week. That was fun to see.
@RespectTheGB Yes, he has a bunch of things in the works no doubt. He said he was going to be busy in '14.
For me personally, 2013 was not the best year. I suppose the 13 is appropriate. So, that is why New Year's is my fav holiday. Fresh start.
@GeminiEileen It is! TY. ;)
It's going to be a busy &amp; great year for @adamlambert in 2014. Between Glee, probable Queen tour, and debut of album #3, we'll be busy too.
@I4Adam2 TY. Yes, celebrated hubby's BD and now enjoying all the great Adam pics/vids. Have an enjoyable weekend too. :)

@adamlambertfcvn @MyEyesBabyEyes Yes, irreplaceable person.
Just wanted to thank the wonderful people in this fan base. I appreciate your tweets and your friendship &amp; appreciate you following me. xo
@GeminiEileen Beautifully said. So true. xo
@BarbaraJWalters Completely agree with you on the separation of church and state. Thanks for speaking out.
@GeminiEileen Yes, he provided us with so much. One of the biggest hearts in this fan base. What a great writer too.
@Here4Adam Yes, he was the one that could be counted on for dedication and loyalty to Adam but always being generous to Adam's fans as well.
I miss Gale Whittington. A class act whose tweets were always thoughtful, kind &amp; genuine. I was honored he followed/replied to me. Loved A.
@adamlambert Wonderful that you'll be fundraising/performing at the Trevor Project event tonight. You're a giving and thoughtful performer.
It is just funny to me how people will unfollow you &amp; you have no reason why. lol. Well, their loss. I am a positive tweeter but I'm honest.
@coptoit The industry that fails to acknowledge true talent.
@I4Adam2 Hi girl. TY :)
@Adamlyn Yes, it just seems odd to me that the best entertainer and singer in the industry isn't included in any capacity. So I boycott.
Glad that @adamlambert is getting the accolades, notice, exposure &amp; work he deserves.  He's the consummate performer/artist. #fact
As a huge entertainment fan, used to watch every music award show. But if Adam Lambert (synonymous with excellence) isn't included, I don't.
Can't stop dreaming, believing or caring. Inspiring thought.	TY @sherryrose99 http://t.co/m4hLlX8iOK
Adam changed his avi to suit his more whimsical side. But I still loved that dreamy avi he had a couple of weeks ago. Such a handsome man.
@musicagain333 I understand that. So busy this time of year. Have happy holidays, my friend. :)
@adamlambert You are in the right industry. Music is it. (TY @sherryrose99 for pic) http://t.co/6sVeJLOVZN
@I4Adam2 I love your header. Elvis/Adam pics. Fan of both and what similarities.
@fromthegreyfort @nyhome He was the reason I started on Twitter. Wanted to know what he was up to. Yes, hope '14 means another Adam concert.
@musicagain333 Me too. TY for the reply.
Adam Lambert has an average of 800 new followers on Twitter daily. 	He has 2,178,452. Who wouldn't follow this interesting man?
@adamlambert My hub went to a bar/restaurant &amp; heard "Starman." That same evening, we went to another restaurant and heard "WWFM" ‚ù§Ô∏è U both.
@adamlambert Breathtaking. Thanks for sharing that. I live in Phoenix and I am amazed at some of the sunrises and sunsets here too.
Yes, very much! ‚Äú@Cazglambert_: @adamlambert Glamberts love You too :-*‚Äù
I miss Adam's avi. That was one of the best pics of him. I will just look at it in my photos. He is supporting fan art which is nice of him.

@E_L_James Looking forward to seeing the movie. Have you been considering the soundtrack when it comes to @adamlambert 's "Chokehold"?
@adamlambert I enjoy your self-deprecating humor. TY for having so many admirable traits. Is it any wonder so many ppl respect/love you?
@ame29 No, it wasn't about his loneliness thank goodness. It was a video about how we connect through social media.
@adamlambert In regard to your tweet two days ago on loneliness, I feel strongly this is true also. :) http://t.co/swLIMjU6Mu
Feel sad for hateful, insecure, jealous ppl w/no life of their own who choose to go online &amp; write stupid, rude &amp; hurtful things to celebs.

@SuesArtistry I believe they'll regret it. TP was gr8. Adam has proven to be an original songwriter. Moving up/forward thx to his decision.
I'm glad Adam knows his worth/believes in his talent. Saying bye to a  label that didn't supt him properly has been a great &amp; positive move.
@SuesArtistry I've been to Winstar b4 &amp; played an Idol slot machine w/Adam's voice on it &amp; my hub is from MS. Hope u &amp; I can see him in '14.
@6thsenseplus True. Beautiful shot of him. They don't always use my fav pics of him in mags; this time they did us proud. :)
@SuesArtistry I know what you mean about RL. Hope you are doing well. Saw him last year but no plans this yr. Feel '14 will be gr8 for him!
@SuesArtistry Hi Sue! Just reading through it and lo and behold! lol YW. Thx for the tweet.

Wonderful to hear Adam is picking up more fans every day. When you have a talent like that, it seems a real shame for people to miss out.

My expectations are going to be lower when it comes to people &amp; things. That way I will be disappointed less &amp; hopefully happily surprised.
Now I see why Adam doesn't like to be asked his "favorite" anything. Someone or something will be excluded and left out. I appreciate that.
@adamlambert  is living his dream. How many people can say that?

@TXsunshine001 It really was a great album. So much work went into it and it had so many potential hits. Hard to understand this travesty.
@TXsunshine001 I had no idea. TP will always be one of my fav albums. I should have put a link to Amazon ;) I know the era has passed but...
While we wait for Adam's new music, we should all go out &amp; buy another copy of TP and give this underrated and under promoted album its due.
@adamlambert You don't owe me anything. I do not feel entitled. But having a reply, retweet - anything from you would mean so much to me.
@adamlambert Thanks for bringing people together. You have a very supportive, kind &amp; fun fan base as you know.

@RobinInSA TY. I am trying to hang on but I don't know if I should. I mean...nothing when others get several?You're wonderful. Thx 4 supt.
There comes a time when you have to realize it is time to move on. You deserve better and if you aren't feeling the love, it's a sign to go.
@Cazglambert @RobinInSA Uh yeah, girls. You have nothing to complain about. I have had zero retweets, replies...hard to stay positive lately

Got a front row seat for the iHeartRadio concert - in my living room. My hub found the CW cable network for me. Adam will rock it with Queen
Adam has met some of his idols in the past. But meeting or singing with David Bowie would be the icing on the cake. Hope it happens...
True friendship is not a competition. There is no bragging or jealousy. A true friend takes pleasure in your success &amp; happiness.
@annehedonia13 @SuesArtistry Very true. Thx.
IMO, Adam Lambert's fan base is one of the most thoughtful, intelligent and supportive ones out there. Count on supt for him &amp; fellow fans.
Hope everyone had a Happy Labor Day. Going back to work tomorrow certainly makes me think that it's time to... http://t.co/KGqhvFPMfx
I follow Adam but would never presume he needs my advice on his personal life, style or career. I hope others can refrain &amp; just enjoy him.

Luv Nile &amp; intro of A!‚Äú@LibraLaurie: Adam Lambert - Trespassing with Nile Rodgers at AFTEE - 8/19/13: http://t.co/7hmprGkax7 via @youtube‚Äù
@Cazglambert @RobinInSA You guys are so cute. It will be so overwhelming when - (not if) it happens; no telling how I will handle it. ;)
@RobinInSA @Cazglambert I need in on this too! Ha! Love ya both. TY for the support and encouragement. ‚ù§ #Glamily
@RobinInSA Me too; exactly what you said. :) Have to believe it will happen. We will both have that dream come true.
@Cazglambert @RobinInSA Not butting in. I just want that so much as you know. I am not a very patient person. lol
@RobinInSA Me too! I need some connection with Adam. Giving up on a retweet or reply on Twitter but I hope for a M&amp;G one day. #Dreamcometrue
@adamlambert http://t.co/CVBCehlN2Y
All I can say after seeing those vids is Adam was incredible. I love Nile and Shady should have been a megahit. TY Sam/Adam 4 tweeting Nile.
@SuesArtistry That isn't good. Y'all get better. TTYT. üå∫
@SuesArtistry Very familiar. ;) Sure; no prob. ‚ù§
@SuesArtistry Hope you get some good rest, sweetie. Get better.
@SuesArtistry I will be happy to. It is one of my fav getaways. Exciting and fun. So many great things to do esp at the MGM. ;)
@SuesArtistry üòòHope you have a good night, dear friend. xxoo
@SuesArtistry Or Under Pressure would work. :) Nope, but MGM is my fav hotel &amp; I will be there this yr but not at the same time as iHeart.
@SuesArtistry That would be a dream esp for Adam. :)
Prediction: iHeart Radio special guest with Queen + Adam Lambert will be David Bowie. And Adam will sing "Let's Dance" with his idol.
No one could ever overpower the vocals of Adam Lambert. He is a powerhouse vocalist yet has the generosity to let others shine.
@LJak07 I am excited for him 2. I feel/hope good things will start happening more &amp; more esp w/more exposure. I love Shady - Nile collab :)
@LJak07 Yes, Adam co-wrote some strong songs that ultimately could have been hit singles if released/promoted. It's time for A to shine now.
@LJak07 I still hear WWFM once in a while (biggest hit to date) but yes, I felt TP had even stronger songs and should have had radio play.
@nilerodgers You're a giant in the music industry. I admire, respect &amp; adore you. Thanks for keeping funk alive &amp; well. Best music there is.
@meezer2000 @LJak07 @BoomerSoonerGal Yes, if it happens again, we will speak loudly; get heard and have justice for Adam's incredible talent
@BoomerSoonerGal @meezer2000 Yes he is. Absolutely.
@meezer2000 @BoomerSoonerGal I think the president should recognize him not only for equal treatment on radio but also for his activism. :)
The things we do/did to support Adam - true devotion, loyalty &amp; passion for a man so deserving of massive success. Will support him 4 ever.
@meezer2000 @BoomerSoonerGal We were very well behaved. Just called in respectfully to ask them to play his songs. We did as he asked but...
RT @RobinInSA: @adamlambert @nilerodgers And to think, it all started with a tweet...a "shady" tweet!! Luv u guys!! &lt;3 :))
@meezer2000 @BoomerSoonerGal I am still so surprised that 5-6 weren't huge hits but they weren't given a chance. They surpass many on radio.
@BoomerSoonerGal @meezer2000 He def deserves more than he gets. Like y'all said, we can be a powerful group. Would fight 4 him any day.
Hearing @adamlambert sing a new song is going to be exciting. He always puts the hard work in for a great show. A pro. Lookin' good in NY.
@BoomerSoonerGal @meezer2000 Don't mean to butt in but just wanted to say if radio doesn't play Adam's songs from #3, we should organize. ;)
@Support On my iPad, I'm only seeing tweets from 8/6 and the last hour of the present day. It used to have a "Load more tweets" but no more.

@adamlambert You bring people together. You gave us a second family. TY. Everyone is excited to hear Lay Me Down. Have fun.
Watching Friends rerun on TBS. Thought it kind of interesting that David Arquette appeared in one episode of it. Had scenes with Phoebe.
@LoveAdamsEyes If it is a done deal (I thought there was still a poss A would be a judge) then, me neither. Was a huge fan for 8 seasons.
http://t.co/yHISQNV7pS
@LoveAdamsEyes Yes, me 2. I tried to watch but JL didn't resonate &amp; the contestants never measured up to Adam. This, ratings were way down.
GG &amp; KP fans can slug it out. My fav all time female singer is Carole King. Rock/Pop - the lyrics &amp; melodies. She's my pick  :) Class act 2.
@sandyzzzen @LoveAdamsEyes It will sink for sure. They need it to be fresh; not stale. Oh well, an extra couple of hours free each week. :)
@LoveAdamsEyes I agree with you. They are going back to the era when AI slipped. Bring back the contestant that rocked the show - as judge.
@LoveAdamsEyes It is a singing contest &amp; she may be a good dancer but her vocals aren't really her forte. Well, if Adam isn't a judge; over.
@LoveAdamsEyes Yep, losing decision because ratings will plummet. With Adam, the ratings will soar. A fact that I know in my heart is true.
Me neither. They are dooming Idol. ‚Äú@LoveAdamsEyes: Haven't watched since Season 8~ Won't this year either! @JustJared @JLo @AmericanIdol‚Äù
Proof that record execs don't always know a hit. For example, "they didn't get" Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines. Would't fund music vid.
He handles them perfectly w/humor! ‚Äú@feraltwirler: ROFLMAO ADAM!!!! "Everybody's NUTS" hahahahaha I love him so much http://t.co/gKZ3pe3che‚Äù
@adamlambert Looking great as usual.
@mientran84 @bellesxxoo @musicagain333 TY for the replies/favs/retweets. Hope y'all have a great weekend.
Just like @adamlambert sings so beautifully in "Never Close Our Eyes," none of us are promised to see tomorrow. http://t.co/S63CeQuDNV
I don't read a celeb's twitter feed/comments in articles cuz some ppl r hateful. Most written is untrue. These are ppl who hate themselves.
I hope Adam continues to believe in himself &amp; his talent, live life on his terms, make decisions &amp; call the shots &amp; trust in his judgement.
@adamlambert is the quintessential performer. Part of his allure is his incredibly perfect face &amp; body. He's the total pkg - has it all!

I wanted to thank my best friend for sending me so many great pics that I use on Twitter. And thank you Glamberts for supporting each other.

@bmoschetti TY for the encouragement. Me too. Hope it makes him smile if he sees it.
I like Adam's look either way. The facial hair looked good on him. Now he is clean shaven. Bet he got tired of hearing Melvin - not his fav.
@adamlambert As simplistic as it is, this is really all we need, don't you think? ;) http://t.co/z52sVLDco2
@bmoschetti TY hon. I will tweet it to him. ;)
@adamlambert Yes! We get to see the complete pic. OMG. That is epic. TY Adam.
I wish people realized that as simplistic as it is, this is really all we need. There's no need for hate. Peace/Love http://t.co/LrByNwE870
So do I. It's one of my favs. Header/avi are perfect‚Äú@SleepwalkerAL94: Every time Adam tweets, I love looking at his new avi ;]‚Äù
@adamlambert Love your new avatar and header. Epitomizes your strong, powerful and rockin' self. TY for all you do for your fans.
@SuesArtistry Yes, there's so many wonderful things he did to promote the LGBT community. Talented as an author, activist &amp; Adam promoter.
The other thing I loved about Gale was that he responded w/replies even though he was busy &amp; had lots of followers. He was generous &amp; kind.
@SuesArtistry No, I haven't. Thank you, Sue. I remember when he posted you on Adam's Fan FB page. Very sad news today. Great man.
I am so sad about the passing of our Gale. He was instrumental in getting us major Adam news and he loved this fandom. We loved him so much.
RT @CuckooBert: @adamlambert The greatest news you just brought to us. Can't wait to hear your new music. Love you! ‚ù§üíúüíõüíöüíóüíô

@plumcomm Thx for the info. Anyone that disses Adam is forever off my list. Good thing A has ppl in the biz that respect him.

I love Adam Lambert's new Twitter header. Shows his rockin' side. And the black and white imagery is cool. He just knows what works.
@shoshannastone Thank you so much for answering! Appreciate your effort on that. I understand. You are the best!
@BoomerSoonerGal Yes, that is so true.
@BoomerSoonerGal I agree. It is just common courtesy to say thank you when someone praises you/your work. He is certainly a generous man.
Prob the reason some singers don't tweet Adam Lambert w/support is because they are jealous/intimidated by his talent, voice &amp; charisma.
@RobinInSA Just when I thought he couldn't get any more gorgeous. Oh my. My present fav too! ILHSM too. :)

@drct28 TY hon. Sad but true.
Twitter is a double edged sword. It brings people together but it also brings out the worst in people as well. It can be a bully playground.

@Glambertgirl69 So sorry you are going through it right now. You have people that care. xo
@Glambertgirl69 It is a mutual admiration &amp; support system. Just hope you can get through it with minimal difficulty. Just take care of you.
@Glambertgirl69 YW hon. It is comforting for all of us. Like a second family.
I'm glad that Adam has a strong self image/confidence in his talent/abilities cuz when you reach his level of fame, ppl try to tear you down
@Glambertgirl69 My best to you. Know you have people here that care about you. Adam brought us all together to support each other.
@adamlambert couldn't look any better if he tried. He has the perfect physique, height &amp; face. Most attractive man in every way. #perfection

@RobinInSA Completely agree. Hard work def deserves successful outcome. You just root for a multi-talented man with a kind heart. #hopeful

@shadylady1031 Yes, Lay Me Down is our next hope. Good point. It needs the support to get it heard.
So glad Adam Lambert has worked with such talented people. I just feel that it is his turn to have that huge hit song that rocks the nation.
Nile &amp; Pharrell r involved in these big hit songs now &amp; worked w/Adam on TP - gr8 songs like Shady &amp; TP. Both should have been megahits too.
Adam has 2,069,104 Twitter followers. That will increase substantially after his appearance on Glee. Adam &amp; TV are a match made in heaven.

Adam Lambert is so hot that it doesn't matter if he has facial hair or not. He looks great either way. Here's proof. http://t.co/sPPwxHxon5
Adam &amp; Queen will be the highlight of the iHeart radio music festival &amp; his stint on Glee will give him more visibility. So happy for him.
Adam has a great career. It is ok for us to express our hopes. We have his best interest at heart. It is his life/career, but we can discuss
I hope Adam's first single off his new album will get noticed, heard &amp; promoted. Then, performed w/TV exposure with a music vid as well.
Glee premiered on 5/19/09 after American Idol Season 8. The finale of AI was next night on 5/20-last time AI was exciting due 2 Adam Lambert

@adamlambert Looking forward to album #3. I love your original music because you write songs that rock our world. Hope to meet you one day.
Was listening to Pandora w/my hub. When A came on singing a song w/a more rock vibe, he said he should do more like that. I told him he is.
@annehedonia13 YW. :) Enjoy your weekend too, Valerie.
@RobinInSA YW. TY for the close-up pic of Adam. Oh my, he looked good last night. And yes, I am just watching all these great vids now! :)
@SuesArtistry Yes they are. His career should start exploding now. Getting a label that will promote/support him will be what he deserves.
#FF @ziamp @RobinInSA @plumcomm @LoveAdamsEyes @Texasplaything @annehedonia13 I know I am leaving out lots of great ppl. Just TY/luv to all!
@SuesArtistry Yes, gonna be exciting this year!
He looks &amp; sounds great. More importantly, luv what he's saying about his career. For him, it's just the beginning - a fresh start.
@SuesArtistry :) Hi hon. Yep, RCA missed the boat with this one.
When you have an exceptional album like TP, you promote it. When you have an extraordinary artist like Adam,  consider yourself very lucky.
@mientran84 Sure hon. TY.
@asiladam You're welcome. TY.
#FF @Here4Adam @SuesArtistry @Glambert3672 @Cazglambert @asiladam @itisaball @mientran84 @nicellis14 @BoomerSoonerGal Luv ya guys!
@DrBrianMay Happy Birthday to one of the most talented, kindest and generous men in the music industry. You rock in so many ways!
@Cazglambert TY gorgeous. :)
#NationalTellAGirlSheIsBeautifulDay @Cazglambert You are also appreciated greatly! Hugs.
@itisaball Beautifully said on all counts. Love this rock ballad.
@Glambert3672 @itisaball TY!  :)
@Gleebert1 @itisaball Me too! Always will.
@Gleebert1 @itisaball @adamlambert I am recording it now! Can't wait to hear it. It is an incredible song/vid by amazing Adam.
@itisaball @Gleebert1 @adamlambert That is my fav. Has sentimental value for me. I cried when he finally sang it live. Vid was incredible 2.
Great news!‚Äú@Gleebert1: I loved hearing @adamlambert's Time For Miracles closing America's Got Talent!!! Adam!! Unbelievable. I was crying!‚Äù

The best news ever (IMO) is that Adam is going back to his roots of rock 'n roll for the next album. I love pop, but his voice is rockin'.
@Cazglambert  TY sweetie. ;)
@BoomerSoonerGal That was my first thought when I heard that. That would be a dream come true for Adam too - to meet one of his influences.
This is so true‚Äú@glamnut: @adamlambert @AmericanIdol Idol will never find anyone else like you. You are the best the show has ever had!‚Äù

Let's see - Adam's trifecta. Glee, Queenbert and AI? I bet it is true.

@adamlambert instinctively knows when his fans need a lift. And his instincts are something to be celebrated on so many levels. TY Adam.

This is a great week for Adam Lambert fans. And I believe the critically acclaimed Trespassing will 1 day get its due. Soon, Glee &amp; album 3!
@adamlambert @nilerodgers I luv these tweets. Appreciate the mutual respect you have for each other. And, I just watched Forrest Gump again!
If you're fortunate enough to have a powerhouse talent like Adam on your label, you support, promote &amp; listen to him. Onward &amp; upward 4 A!
@adamlambert This is why we admire, respect &amp; love you. You're your own man with a vision. So happy w/your decision. Proud to be your fan.

@Here4Adam TY hon. You're a sweetheart.
The news this week regarding Adam has certainly added a much needed spark. Everything lit up - Twitter, Websites, TV, &amp; our faces.  ;)
They've added original music to Glee. Last season a new character wrote her own songs. Before that, there was an org song at nationals. üòÄüéµ
@RobinInSA Yes, very exciting! And good find on the pic. I will tweet one last thought on the subject as reinforcement for your great tweet.
@RobinInSA Yes! Love that pic!
@RobinInSA @6thsenseplus Exactly! Adam breaks the mold. Don't count anything out when it comes to him. Love your optimism!
@RobinInSA Love the way you think! Possibilities are endless. :)
@adamlambert was already a worldwide superstar but this latest venture is going to take him into the stratosphere of the entertainment world
@Texasplaything :) I will try to sleep. Ha! One of the most exciting Adam days in a while!
Another pic of Adam with Glee peeps. I can now go to sleep with a gleeful smile. Exciting day for Adam Lambert fans! http://t.co/TJd8Vvf9T2
Yes they do!"@Wild4Adam: @adamlambert  @MrRPMurphy Adam, your exceptional voice, looks and talent belong on screen"
@adamlambert @MrRPMurphy We are so excited too! Thank you both for tweeting!
This is a great career move for Adam. A spotlight on his talent w/TV exposure. Glee premiered during his AI season. AIs loss is Glee's gain.
@adamlambert So happy for you! Love Glee and now I'll be watching every episode several times! Congratulations, multi-talented star!
I watch Glee and am so happy that Adam will be on the show! Photo with Glee star Darren Criss this year. http://t.co/4ijabGn0qz
@adamlambert is going to be in the cast of Glee? Woohoo!
More evidence of Adam Lambert's generosity: He doesn't tweet for several days, but when he does, it is to promote another artist.
@adamlambert TY for all the well-crafted albums &amp; songs thru the years. Can't wait to see what you envision next! http://t.co/E1dnIjPCUN
@LiamMcEwan Thank you! You are always so gracious in replying too.
@LiamMcEwan Congrats on your reward! It is so gratifying when such a deserving person wins an award. Thank you for all you do for AL fans!
@fromthegreyfort Sure! Thank you too. Looking forward to it myself.
@fromthegreyfort Beautifully written and very true.
One of the multitude of things I admire about @adamlambert is his originality, confidence, leadership and vision. He does it all perfectly.
If there's anything I've learned in 4-1/2 yrs is that unless Adam says it, I cannot assume it is true. Album #3 will be great - that I know.
@adamlambert instinctively knows how to please any audience. He's a multi-talented man of course, but he also has strong leadership skills.
@TeamCNN I just have a quick question. Does CNN HLN have any plans in the near future to go hi-def? CNN is in hi-def but HLN is not. Thanks!
@asiladam ;) TY!
#TP was a beautifully produced, written and executed album. Adam Lambert did a tremendously great job on it. It was the best album of the yr
@TeamCNN @CNNReliable Thank you for the reply! CNN is my favorite news source.
@mientran84 Thanks sweetie. That means a lot. So do you! Enjoy all the lovely things you say about him too. Hope you are doing well. :)
@mientran84 Hi there! ;) Thanks.
The next event with the opportunity to see the best live performer of today @adamlambert will be July 19 at a concert in Paso Robles, CA.
The way to introduce Adam Lambert in an article is not "American Idol runner up" but instead "Grammy nominated artist" or any number of ways
@JohnAvlon @CNNReliable You did a great job guest hosting Reliable Sources. I wish and hope for you as permanent host if you are interested.
@heretohearyou @AmericanIdol @adamlambert Couldn't imagine a better choice. He would be doing the job for the right reasons. Thx 4 the vid.
Went to MIM today - Musical Instrument Museum, here in Phoenix, AZ. Gave me even more appreciation for musicians.
Adam singing "Music Again." That song has meaning for many of us. Love it!
Two nights in a row streaming Adam. Can't be unhappy about that. ;)
Adam has incorporated Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Queen &amp; Jimi Hendrix in his repertoire. These are my husband's favs. Our music lives mesh üéµ
Appreciate it. ‚Äú@xxInNirvanaStay: @LAMBERTLUST Thank you so much for the stream!!‚Äù

@saweetmaryc ;) Thanks.
@Cazglambert Thx for noticing hon ;) Your tweet today put things in perspective for me. I need to be thankful for the experience I've had xo
@adamlambert has proven to be a humble man. Confident yet unassuming. He's someone who promotes others yet performs better than anyone.
@Cazglambert That's such a good point! I've seen A 5 times (twice last yr) yet I get upset that I've never met him or been replied to. Oops.
@adamlambert How it must feel to have the audience in the palm of your hand...your performances are incredible. You just get better everyday
@adamlambert Remember how it felt 2 meet Madonna 4 the 1st time yrs ago? That's what I'm hoping for w/u. Or just a reply/retweet-anything ;)
"Coming up with something new and original is so exciting." - Adam Lambert. @adamlambert Your upcoming new music is highly anticipated.
@plumcomm Absolutely. We resist doing that because it is simply unnecessary. Thanks for the reply. ;)

@adamlambert @MotownMusical @thecharlbrown Of all the Broadway musical shows, this is the one I want to see most. He is very talented.
@adamlambert If I was in NY, I'd see all the shows too. Of course no one would know who I am. Glad you're taking in the great entertainment.
@adamlambert  So cool to hear it. You are a worldwide superstar; quite fitting. Sounds like David Bowie is the last idol of yours to meet.
"Never give up on a dream just because of the time it will take to accomplish it. The time will pass anyway." A quote I need right now ;)

"Adam Lambert will become this generation's most iconic international star." - Kerry Kolsch @adamlambert I believe this wholeheartedly too.
@adamlambert has the talent, looks, personality, charm &amp; wit to pull off: movie star, TV star, host, model, etc but a singer/songwriter 1st.
@Cazglambert I think your tweets are what got me started, beautiful. ;) Hello to you too!
When it comes to Adam, I really only care about his music, TV appearances, concerts - his career. His personal life is none of my business.
@LoveAdamsEyes It was Lee Cherry. Ah, yes,positive connotation. Never would say anything negative about his good friend unless kidding; yep.
@LoveAdamsEyes Yes it is! Wasn't sure who that was in ref to but was hoping it was A. ;) Word sounds like it would be negative. Luckily not.
Those that write mean-spirited comments on Twitter to celebs have probs IMO. They must hate themselves &amp; are jealous, sad, unhappy or angry.
@LoveAdamsEyes A good thing. ;) A decent &amp; responsible person. Having admirable characteristics, such as fortitude and firmness of purpose.

Adam's name was shown on HBOs Real Time with Bill Maher! Shown on a segment w/a newspaper heading "...Lambert's F Word." At the 32 min mark.
This is also the face of fierceness, confidence &amp; rebellion. Deserves respect for his independent thoughts/actions. http://t.co/JNKeF8Bg6f

@adamlambert You are so loved. TY for being attentive, generous &amp; kind to your fans. We appreciate all that you do for us. You're the best.
I know fame is a double edged sword. But the lack of privacy doing daily activities would be the absolute worst to have to contend with IMO.
There's nothing like reading Adam's humorous &amp; smart tweets.	And he gets his point across in a subtle way to those that wronged him.
Just in case you want to show everyone the power of the Glamberts ;) http://t.co/wymwvwyhTk via @PeopleMag
Next event for Adam per Adam Lambert Events: June 15 - Pittsburgh, PA concert. Glad he has some time off meantime.
Ellen - another talk show host that keeps it positive and genuinely loves Adam. http://t.co/ZYS3jJFrt5
@BoomerSoonerGal That's for sure. I actually heard someone on TV say she is the next Oprah. I don't think so. Far from it.
Oprah Winfrey is a true fan of Adam's and she is a class act. She treats former guests fairly. http://t.co/55Vh5dnr5X
WW is a joke on The Soup. Her behavior is erratic &amp; she's obviously two faced. So I would not validate anything she says or does.

Beginning in Jan. 2009, I became enamored by Adam Lambert. I wasn't interested in the peripherals - just solo act Adam. He's still my focus.
@LoveAdamsEyes Def  support you &amp; agree with your tweets. They better not report you. You are stating honest opinions; nothing wrong w/that.
Adam is so funny. "I love this country" - in response to the other A's oops moment. Our Adam is so smart and has the BEST personality.

Remembering, honoring and thanking those brave men and women that sacrificed their lives for our lives and for our country. #MemorialDay
Love the many looks of Adam Lambert; they span from tender to tough. http://t.co/3ihbVrm6EK
After seeing A perf for the 1st time, I was mesmerized by his magnetism, voice &amp; charisma. It's always been about the man &amp; his music only.
I am glad that @adamlambert states "songwriter" in his Twitter bio. His music encompasses every aspect of his many talents.
Completely agree! Solo Artist :) ‚Äú@LoveAdamsEyes: Adam Lambert proves again what a wonderful Worldwide Solo Artist he is! #Lifeball2013‚Äù

I have said this before and I will say it again. Adam Lambert is one sexy, masculine hunk of a man. Attractive inside and out too.
@BoomerSoonerGal Man, great idea! Pics, vids, DVDs of anything Adam - so valuable.
@BoomerSoonerGal We sure do! Too many to count! The recordings are all overflowing on my DVR as proof :)
@BoomerSoonerGal Yes, he has been prob too busy to realize it plus she was sneaky all right ;) One of my fav duets of all time - rocked it.
@BoomerSoonerGal @adamlambert @AllisonIraheta I always loved that duet on AI. Really good moment. Wonder if Adam knows she just eloped.
"We are here on this earth to love and be loved. That is all."

@GGsu4U Makes sense. But it hasn't been favorable for two years about A, has it? No need to answer ;) Rhetorical.
@GGsu4U Pretty shocked to see a PH article tweeted. But it is favorable. Of course that's because A is single again. lol
@Cazglambert_ Hi gorgeous! You look great. I want your hair! ;)
Goodbye @AmericanIdol You have made a choice that will surely sink your show. JH is an unlikeable diva. But TY for Adam Lambert. #Grateful

@BoomerSoonerGal I was asking myself the same question. I hope he will do a medley of his songs on AI one day. But really, JJ did her song.

@Cazglambert_ TY. I do love him so much just like you. We are a supportive team. ;) Love your avi and header. What beautiful pics of him.
@Ziamp Yes it does cause concern. I remember working during a tornado in Dallas and we saw a gas station get destroyed by the tornado. Scary
I rarely tweet so much but thinking about AI a lot. Watched Adam's appearance from '12. Those looks, stage presence &amp; that light show WOW
@Ziamp Yes, but I appreciate the retweet. I am in Phoenix but they are in Dallas.  TY.
In honor of the one year anniversary of Trespassing, I am wearing my t-shirt. This album provided so much enjoyment. http://t.co/5OglymWist
@Ziamp Again, you provide such useful info. I'm from Dallas &amp; have family there. I wouldn't have known the weather situation w/o your tweet.
Looking forward to seeing Adam perform tomorrow. He has done WWFM, Aftermath &amp; NCOE. He is THE best. Truly, HE is what made it exciting!
This will be the 1st time I've watched an episode of AI this year. Just watching to get a feel for it b4 superstar @adamlambert is on Thur.

@GGsu4U Yes, seems to be all about the judges on The Voice. Never watched one full episode. And tried X Factor 1st season but gave it up.
You can say what you will about American Idol but I can't think of one person's name that has come out of The Voice or X Factor.
Oops, I tried to trend early. We are doing it at noon EST. I will try again in an hour and 15 min. Over anxious to have Adam Lambert trend.
#HappyBirthdayTrespassing The best album of 2012 by a long shot!
@adamlambert Thoroughly enjoyed your last appearance on #americanidol singing NCOE. Can't wait to see you Thursday! http://t.co/c4237AlsYS
Many things to celebrate from last year: Adam Lambert with a #1 album -  #Trespassing, Singing with Queen, TV shows - hosting; acting,  etc.
@adamlambert Your sense of humor is just one of the many things I love about you.
#2MillionFollowersForAdamLambert Great to see @RCARecords mention @adamlambert 's Twitter following. Should get there late tonight.
Down to triple digits now. 954 more Twitter followers and Adam has 2 mil. There have been many reasons to celebrate lately. Happy 4 him.
Per AL Events (summary): 5/16-AI Finale; 5/25-Vienna, Austria; 6/15-Pittsburgh, PA; 6/29-Orlando, FL; 7/2-Del Mar, CA; 7/3-Hollywood, CA
@MichaelOrland Appreciate your talent, kindness and generosity. You and Adam work together so well. Such mutual respect &amp; support too.
@OblaKickinIn @Cazglambert_ I don't see anything wrong with it at all. It is a respectful reminder of the person she is singing with.
@Cazglambert_ Nice touch at the end. I know someone has a prob with our tweets to her, but we are being respectful to her.
@Cazglambert_ üëãWaves to you too, hon. This is bad, but now I'm glad she lost. Ha! A shoutout from her to him would have been a classy move.
@adamlambert These great honors, awards and TV appearances happening now have energized the people that adore you. Congrats!

@Cazglambert_ I used your words and tweeted her. Hope you don't mind. It IS an honor and frankly, she seems ungrateful and thoughtless 2 me.
@AngieAI12 If you are doing a duet with the amazing Adam Lambert, do you realize what an honor that is?
@Cazglambert_ That's what I was thinking. Plus she didn't tweet him or follow him. I wish he would duet with someone worthy of him.
@asiladam We will see. I had this silly prediction a while back but hope he gets there even faster ;) Tonight would be welcomed.
Still think Adam will be at 2 mil followers by the 15th. He'll surpass it after AI Thur. 1612 more followers &amp; he has more reason to celeb.
TY for this close up pic of this incredibly handsome man ‚Äú@ScorpioBert: Closeup Adam Lambert =Glaad http://t.co/DFjmUxxiyn‚Äù
Adam is always so humble, which is an honorable trait. But, in last night's speech, he actually admitted to working hard, and I liked that.
Love how everyone comes together on Twitter to promote Adam. The commonality we share is pretty cool. Appreciate you all.
@LAMBERTLUST TY for the great vids/pics tonight!
@GaleChester ‚ù§ You're the best.
@GGsu4U He really is! Luv that pic. Many more awards in the future too. What a week for him in so many ways. Just love to see him so happy.
@GaleChester TY for being such an amazing source for vids/pics of Adam tonight at the GLAAD awards.
@GGsu4U It was very good. Such a natural public speaker. Couldn't love him more either. So deserving of all good things. Happy 2 c this vid!
Very exciting and rewarding to see/hear Adam accept his well deserved awards. What a wonderful week it has been for @adamlambert &amp; his fans.

How many singers do you know that have the vocal range to sing with Queen? The 1 &amp; only Adam Lambert. That deserved more publicity in US too
What great news to come home to! @adamlambert is #1 on Amazon's Movers &amp; Shakers! Trespassing is getting a second wave of recognition.
@GGsu4U Definitely and TP is getting a second life, I hope.
@GGsu4U It does deserve it and so glad that the TV exposure provided that tonight for new viewers.
@GGsu4U Very good news! Like old times, huh? ;)
RT @AmericanIdol: RT if you're a #Glambert! Good catching up with @AdamLambert on #idol.
TP is #54 on iTunes now! The power of national television to remind everyone of the incredibly talented @adamlambert Give Trespassing promo!
@xxInNirvanaStay :)
TP is now #57! Can you imagine what it might be after the AI finale? Plus, Adam is picking up Twitter followers. This is a win/win.
@FoxVegas @laurafoster327 Very exciting. Needed this lift for him &amp; his fans. Just like after Pretty Little Liars, TP had a boost in sales.
@LAMBERTLUST Thank you for following me. I am honored.
"Trespassing Deluxe" by @adamlambert is now #63 on the U.S. Pop iTunes charts! Moving up! I remember when I did this on a daily basis.‚ù§üöß
That 2 min. promo of @adamlambert on @AmericanIdol is the type of publicity a quality performer deserves. TY 4 that! Check out Trespassing!
@LAMBERTLUST Exactly! TP &amp; Adam were robbed of what should have been the album of the yr. His label &amp; promo team didn't do right by him.
@FoxVegas @laurafoster327 That would prob set another record! So glad it is in the top 100 again. Quality songs with a quality performer.
@Queenofsomthin Yes, agree. Expected sev Grammy nods &amp; radio play. When a highly praised/great album like TP comes out, it deserves better.
@Irishgal719 @IHRTADAM Yes, he was messing with the wrong ppl! He wasn't nice at all re: us. So, yes...he learned I hope. Yep, karma baby!
@laurafoster327 @FoxVegas Yes, he had mini tours, but it should have been a huge tour for you to see. I hope sales go over the top now!
RT @bmoschetti: #TRESP is moving on I-Tunes after IDOL pkg! -- when ppl have the opportunity to see/hear you-- makes a big difference! :)  ‚Ä¶

Truths as I see it: "Trespassing" by Adam Lambert was the best album in years and he should be the biggest star in the world. #Bestartist
Was so happy to see Adam Lambert actually promote his work last week. He's so humble that he's usually busy promoting others &amp; not himself.

What has @adamlambert done to me? When I wake up, rather than go online &amp; check out the world news, I 1st see if Adam has tweeted anything.
I remember when 50 Shades came out (read them all) &amp; Adam tweeted about Chokehold for the movie. I'm glad James tweeted about Adam's work.

@68Blackberry Just a suggestion. Unfollow people if you don't like what they are saying rather than complain about their tweets. I did.
"Brains, Beauty and Voice" - Great way to describe @adamlambert
Proud moment of 2012 when Adam Lambert sang with Queen. Rocking out with the great Brian May &amp; Roger Taylor. http://t.co/jGFGlPfX33
@feraltwirler @adamisalamb Yep. It was quick and painless for me. ;)

@adamisalamb TY! Someone was nosing around, and I had to eliminate it. ;)
Mayor Bower to be Grand Marshal for Miami Beach Pride, Adam Lambert to perform - Elsewhere http://t.co/SClEo7SaJa via @metroweekly
Change is good. So strange to me that the 1 thing that needs changing the most remains the same. Everything could improve if the chg is made
This new era of Adam Lambert should have the focus on HIM. 3rd album needs to get more promo. And ppl surrounding him need to support him.
@Krystal_Klearz ;) 100% agree w/what you said and what others said. No need for distraction(s). So wish Adam would see it too.
Great picture of Adam - the star of the show. http://t.co/n4YvKr9jT8
@adamlambert Will always be one of my fav pics of the man destined to be a legend. http://t.co/hnNUyqHhaZ
‚Äú@peoplemag: Best #Idol performance ever?‚Äù Any performance by Adam Lambert. If I had to pick just one, it would be "Whole Lotta Love."
Adam will be in Florida, China, Pittsburgh &amp; Austria in the next few months getting awards, being honored and/or performing.
@adamlambert Your fans adore you. Thx for the sense of humor.
‚ÄúNobody‚Äôs perfect. We all have things we want to work on. I am a work in progress‚Ä¶.‚Äù - Adam Lambert
@BoomerSoonerGal I bet you are right. TY so much. xo Goodnight.
@BoomerSoonerGal Appreciate your support. I know I shouldn't expect it, but it would re-energize me for sure. I would cry too and more. ;)
@BoomerSoonerGal That's encouraging. I don't mean to whine. Just something that's increasingly become more important. So happy 4 u!	#Believe
"We have evolved together with For Your Entertainment and Trespassing.... #3 will be a brand new exploration! :)" - @adamlambert
RT @bmoschetti: #ProudToBeAFanOfAdamLambert -- one classy guy!
@SuesArtistry Ha! Adam has that positivity regardless of the situation. Got to admire that. Plus, he got a jab in there too. He is so funny.
So true!‚Äú@feetchick: it's very entertaining how the media kind of pisses Adam off &amp; he always responds in a classy, fun way lol‚Äù
Love this quote. Ha! "A positive attitude may not solve all your problems, but it will annoy enough people to make it worth the effort."
Anyone that hates on someone as kind as Adam Lambert has major issues. They obviously are so unhappy w/themselves that their heart is dead.
@adamlambert is giving it back to the media. Ha! Nothing like a man with a sense of humor. Sometimes you can remain friends after love.
I am an Adamaniac and I'm Lambertized. I never took to the term Glambert but it stuck. I am an Adam Lambert fan and I love everything Adam.
RT @SweetReunion22: @shoshannastone I didn't know there was a difference. I consider myself the latter...since I don't like labels ;-) # ...
@Bobbie2222 ;) Gets me in trouble sometimes but I do it on occasion anyway. TY
@GGsu4U Me too. Nice find.
TY! Rare for sure‚Äú@GGsu4U: Adam Lambert Behind the Scenes                                          ...: http://t.co/pBHfccx0sw via @youtube‚Äù
@geezersgal ;)
Adam Lambert is the star &amp; the solo act. He is the one that draws the audiences. His band is important to him. He is what is important to me
@adamlambert You inspire people daily with the way you approach and live your life. We are all better for it. TY!
Downside of fame - no privacy. Downside of fandom - they don't know you exist ;) @adamlambert I am not giving up though.
@OblaKickinIn So do I! Love that! Thanks for the news. Happy for them!
RT @SuesArtistry: RIP Margaret Thatcher &amp; Annette Funicello ‚ù§
@wolfblitzer That is one show I definitely went to see. Th for letting us know you enjoyed it. And thx for the great work you do on the air.
Looking forward to new music from @adamlambert. Hard to top TP - most critically acclaimed album of 2012. But you top yourself all the time.
If you can love someone, and keep loving them without being loved back, then that love has to be real. It hurts too much to be anything else
I loved this moment! So cute.‚Äú@xAdamsEmpire: Some call it craziness, I call it dedication. haha :) http://t.co/8qow2gSzkq‚Äù
Adam Lambert has 1,960,151 Twitter followers. Made some major gains recently. He only needs 39,849 to reach 2 mil.
Looking forward to googling or binging Adam and having something come up in reference to his career, music or shows. That'll be refreshing.
@StarGazer5656 We adore the best man ever ;)
@HowardKurtz Thanks for a really great show today. Guests, subjects &amp; dialogue were superb. Your media monitor segment always interesting.
@adamlambert has the most passionate, dedicated, enthusiastic &amp; supportive fans around. Proud to be a part of such a great group of people.
If there's any doubt b4 the media focuses on negativity, where were the stories about singing w/Queen, TP, TV appearances or sold out shows?
They call it a personal &amp; private life for a reason. It's just his. I'm here for Adam and his music. That is really what it is about for me.
@adamlambert Love your sense of humor and a million other things about you. :)
@adamlambert Everyone that knows you loves you. Thanks for being an incredible person. Sending lots of love your way http://t.co/JbMXHjRH4q
Everything that affects Adam affects his true fans. It has always felt more personal. That's prob because he let us in with his huge heart.
"Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all." - 	Alfred Lord Tennyson
@adamlambert We love you too. There's nothing your fans won't do for you. Thanks for everything you do for us!
#BecauseOfAdamLambert I have lost a lot of sleep through the years. ;)
#BecauseOfAdamLambert I realize that miracles can happen.
#BecauseOfAdamLambert I was able to smile again after three of the most difficult years of my life.
@Cazglambert_ DM
#BecauseOfAdamLambert I am a simply a happier person.
@AmericanIdol This is my favorite rock night moment of all time. @adamlambert http://t.co/DU7Dd3lr6W
When you have found the best, who needs the rest? @adamlambert http://t.co/bGyY9qNtQz
@OblaKickinIn Thanks. It just dawned on me. The AI talk on Twitter made me think about it. Appreciate you answering me. ;)
@RobinInSA He really does and that vid reveals it all like you said. Plus, it shows the actor in him. It should happen! :) 	#MovieStarAdam
@TheBJThomas Saw you on Fallon last night. You still have the incredible voice and looks. Just love you; always have.
@RobinInSA He looks incredible! Everyone prob knows by now that's my fav vid. I want to see him on the big screen 2! Movie star looks. #TFM
@Cazglambert_ Hi gorgeous! ;)
Luv it!‚Äú@RobinInSA: I'm watching Time For Miracles by Adam Lambert on @VEVO for iPhone. http://t.co/eqYJOX4Qwu‚Äù
There isn't one person alive that isn't unique in some way. So, celebrate it rather than try to conform and be like everyone else.
@OblaKickinIn Yes, they do :)
@OblaKickinIn Thanks for the tip. Def taping it. Always a fan of his. Plus, he follows back.
@BoomerSoonerGal Exactly. They are missing out. We are the lucky fans who recognize his talent and his heart.
@OblaKickinIn I agree. It is rare. TP hit the mark.
My fav still from the gifs. What a look. http://t.co/esGXq3zgPH
@BoomerSoonerGal That album was a masterpiece. When I first heard it, I thought album of the year. Just need to get ppl to hear #3 this time
@Janislandgirl @cazglambert_ I completely agree. Very fortunate. Added plus - truly great fans with the kindness &amp; love he exudes as well.
Trespassing by Adam Lambert will always be one of my fav albums. And not just because he's my fav but because it has the best music &amp; lyrics
@Cazglambert_ @janislandgirl Ignoring the crays/trolls and will keep it positive. However, if I have an opinion w/luv 4 A, will state it. js
We can all keep loving, supporting, &amp; admiring Adam. And we can all have respectful opinions &amp; state them freely in an open environment.
If this fandom was rid of the T crays and trolls, can you imagine how peaceful &amp; wonderful it would be?	Adam stands for unity &amp; kindness.
@geezersgal Ha! Waiting for #3 for more reasons than one now!
@BoomerSoonerGal @geezersgal Perfect applicable quote. Truly, everyone &amp; everything fades in the background. He is all I see.
@geezersgal @boomersoonergal @cazglambert_ @mollyflyaway @ggsu4u ;) Man, I luv you guys!
@BoomerSoonerGal @geezersgal You are in! TY! Believe we are in the majority  too. :) Feeling great support from great Adam fans!
@MollyFlyAway @ggsu4u @cazglambert_ Everything you guys said. Exactly. Great minds think alike. lol Adam captured my heart - just Adam.
@MollyFlyAway @ggsu4u @cazglambert_ We sure will count you in! :)
@GGsu4U @cazglambert_ Ditto!
Adam Lambert is the best solo performer of my lifetime. I am so fortunate to be living in the @adamlambert era.
@GGsu4U @cazglambert_ This cray element isn't something I ever expected. But get rid of the reason for it, problem solved. I respect/luv A.
@GGsu4U @Cazglambert_ Appreciate the support. You two echo exactly how I feel. I will not be stifled just cuz I stan Adam only. Luv ya both.
@Cazglambert_ @ggsu4u Adam is why I am on Twitter. He is a solo act last time I checked. Band members do come and go but A is forever for us
@Cazglambert_ @ggsu4u TY both. We are def in sync. Will do. :)
@Cazglambert_ @ggsu4u
@rhonglam86 Leg of Barkley. May we have more celeb sightings. ;)
@rhonglam86 Exactly how I felt. Saw him in aisle &amp; behind me in line. He may not want the attn. Pic of leg only lol http://t.co/VNt7NmNsi3
@GGsu4U He could do more to end the madness. I'll continue to voice my opinion. That one pers has the sweetest avi &amp; she was a beotch lol
@GGsu4U Thx for the perspective. U r right. Nothing 2 apologize 4 or quit doing if it is out of love/loyalty 4 A. Plus,  I was right. lol
@GGsu4U I said he caused trouble 4 A &amp; he could try 2 stop it. The very rude pers said why blame T? The other kinder 1 didn't like the drama
@rhonglam86 Cool! Yes, I felt that he's finally doing regular things &amp; I should give him his space. I feel better about my decision. TY!
@GGsu4U TY. You're so right! I won't. Some ppl unfollowed me &amp; I got grief from one. But it was out of my love for him. You understand. xo
I just saw Charles Barkley at CVS. I didn't want to bother him so I didn't say anything. So exciting to see a celeb, esp in AZ.
Oldie but goodie. Aside from his singing &amp; personality, the man has the looks, body &amp; style. @adamlambert #totalpkg http://t.co/3x3eW8Hmbb
@teralex42 @adamlambert It was mine too. What a man!
@adamlambert has the best personality. I mean, this is just one of the reasons I love this man so much! http://t.co/dkK85U8A5s
Twitter was interesting to say the least tonight. Sometimes u feel the need 2 speak your mind. Frankly, I think Adam admires that in people.
@LoveAdamsEyes @cazglambert_ It is hard sometimes for sure. Challenging. I was challenged tonight. lol
@LoveAdamsEyes My pleasure. So true.
@Cazglambert_ That's what I luv about ya. ;) Good for you.
@LoveAdamsEyes lol So true. Just wanted to tell you that people could learn from you - the way you respect others even if you disagree.
