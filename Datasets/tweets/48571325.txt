@groworpay @Mansfields_Own @WendyPetry2 @ZaidJilani @AndrewYangVFA UBI is NOT more progressive than a universal jobs guarantee. There are a bunch of sound arguments that show UBI will not do as much good workers as a UJG. Even the simple supply and demand argument can illuminate how UBI might hurt the middle class while a UJG can only help.
@BuzzFeedNews @BuzzFeed @BuzzFeedNews, are you serious? This headline makes Buzzfeed look horrible. Honestly, it’s so bad that only someone in @SenFeinstein’s pocket would characterize this the way you have. Get a grip on reality and think about what side of history you want to be on.
@Cernovich You’re an idiot that obviously has no idea what child abuse is, and should just shut up about it. If you ever said this to someone who actually experienced child abuse and that person didn’t clean your clock then its only because they pity you.

@Cernovich You’re correct about the media not covering that because it’s not true. Trump’s approval ratings are horrible. Some “people” love Trump, and less do now than loved him in 2016. If they didn’t cover that phenomenon then, why would they cover a weaker version of it now?

@dgramling @charliekirk11 ..and like I posted earlier, 1.3% of abortions happen after 20 weeks. I don’t know how many babies are left in dumpsters, maybe you could find some stats on that and share them here? Regardless, you need to stop spreading misinformation about medically necessary abortions.
@dgramling @charliekirk11 Any serious doctor would never testify that there could never be a case where an abortion is needed to protect the health of the mother. I have person experience with this exact thing, actually. I know you’re either lying or ignorant.
@GMRasp @charliekirk11 ..where are you getting your statistics about the reasons for late-term abortions? I wasn’t able to find stats to that specific thing, but I do have personal experience with a &gt;20week medically necessary abortion, and have a Dr friend who works in this field and he agrees w me.

@charliekirk11 For the uniformed: do you honestly think a woman would go through the whole 9mo process of creating a child inside her body, just to abort it at the last minute bc she had regrets or smthng? Abortions at these late-stages are almost ALWAYS done to protect the life of the mother.

@GlobalC29894783 @Cernovich @marcorubio I do not support Maduro in any way. The US should not declare anyone President, either. And I’m sorry, but US sanctions on VZ haven’t affected the people of VZ? Do you think that blocking VZ oil exports has no effect on the ppl of VZ?
@GlobalC29894783 @Cernovich @marcorubio You all need to relax and refrain from inferring my position when I haven’t stated one. I am against all forms US intervention in VZ, except any that have the explicit purpose of negotiation and peaceful resolution. No sanctions, no military, no violence, no embargo, no nothing.

@spifffan @DevorahLeah @mehdirhasan @jbendery AOC may not yet have much experience as a politician, but is that how YOU decide who fights for your interests and speaks to your values? To say she’s only putting on a performance is demeaning to the people who she fights for. Who fights for you and what have they done for you?
@chandler_mitch @JimInhofe Where do your “rights” come from? ..Have you read the 2A? It’s the opinion of SCOTUS that firearms can be regulated. Dude, the words “well-regulated” are in the 2A. Also, every state is its own sovereign.
@Meghan_BB_ @spifffan @DevorahLeah @mehdirhasan @jbendery I suggested to you that you stop sexualizing AOC and see her for what she stands for.. then you defended Hillary’s 2016 campaign loss by saying she was unfairly attacked for superficial qualities despite her deep policy understanding. What happened to you?
@Meghan_BB_ @spifffan @DevorahLeah @mehdirhasan @jbendery You think AOC is trying to dismantle the D party? What is your basis for saying that? Is the D party your own personal party?.. where anyone who doesn’t share your specific policy goals doesn’t belong in your Dem party? Do you not believe in primaries and democracy?
@ColoLatino @spifffan @DevorahLeah @mehdirhasan @jbendery @realDonaldTrump Idk.. seriously, can you really say that there aren’t some older women out there who would swoon over DT if he tried to romance them? Personally, I think he’s a disgusting, ugly human being.. but to say that women in the core of his base don’t find him attractive is wrong IME
@chellmit1 @JimInhofe ..actually, the 2A is incorporated against the states.. which means that every state has just as much power as the federal government to regulate firearms.
@chellmit1 @JimInhofe Have you read Supreme Court case law on the 2nd Ammendment? There is no rule, there is no law, there is no precedent, there is no Supreme Court case that says making laws to regulate firearms is illegal or unconstitutional. The words “well regulated” are literally in the 2A.
@JamesFourM @painter_nancy @AOC ..in a year where THE MOST diverse congress ever was elected, AOC.. or anyone, for that matter.. has the right to criticize a major news outlet that doesn’ look like the diverse electorate that they’re tasked with reporting on.

@spifffan @DevorahLeah @mehdirhasan @jbendery Yes, Gabbard is attractive.. but she doesn’t belong in the same breath as AOC with respect to so many issues. Let me (maybe be the first?) to suggest that its YOU that has trouble looking at those women without sexualizing them. Don’t project your issues on powerful women.
@spifffan @DevorahLeah @mehdirhasan @jbendery I might agree that both AOC and Gabbard get a non-zero boost in their public profiles because of they’re attractiveness, but AOC’s profile is MASSIVE.. and that’s bc of her policy vision, moral integrity, and connectedness with her base. Shes becoming the voice of a generation...
@chellmit1 @JimInhofe ..but it’s also constitutionally questionable. You think that the federal government has the right dictate state law to the states themselves? With carry-reciprocity, a change in one state’s gun laws would become immediately effective in the other 49 states’ laws.
@chellmit1 @JimInhofe So the same apply for heroin, fentanyl and cocaine, right? What if one state passes a law that removes all penalties for drinking and driving?.. should any state allow that person to drink and drive in their state too? What you’re suggesting is actually extremely undemocratic..

@regwag2003 @NomikiKonst Nomi’s point: this can, and very likely does, happen everywhere. Bernie cannot possibly be expected to personally oversee and give approval for every action someone who worked on his giant campaign took. The fact that he’s being put at the center of this shows @thehill ‘s bias.
@regwag2003 @NomikiKonst Come to find out, 2 years later, as you’re considering starting up another company, people come out and say that some of those ppl.. who were hired by ppl who were hired by ppl who were hired by someone you hired.. were sexually mistreated. Is that a reflection on YOU?
@regwag2003 @NomikiKonst Let me be clearer for you: You’re the CEOof a company thats growing exponentially faster than you planned. You hire a few people, you tell those ppl to hire ppl, and so on down the line. The company gets bigger... so big that now you can’t possibly meet everyone who works for you
@JimInhofe What if one state legalized heroin and cocaine so long as you received a state-issued license from that state? Would you allow that person to travel into your state with their drugs, without any repercussions?
@JimInhofe Laws like this allow guns in places where the citizens of that place have democratically decided to ban guns. Why are you forcing your way of life on me? Would you also pass a bill that allows me to bring marijuana into any state without penalty so long as I’m from CA?
@monsoon2112 @regwag2003 @NomikiKonst @monsoon2112, you’re too far detached from objective reality for me to continue a conversation with you.

@eagle1776n @darkjustin77 @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou Btw, it’s “I’ve proven”, not “I’ve proved”. Don’t knock people for their reading comprehension if you can’t properly construct a sentence. I laid out in my previous tweet, I’m not repeating myself for you. Yo, I’m for real done with you though.. Cheers mate.
@eagle1776n @darkjustin77 @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou You are the one with the burden of proof. I am saying there is no difference between the relationship Gore/Kerry had w Devine to the relationship Sanders had w Devine. YOU are trying to say it’s different. It’s not on me to know whether Man and Dev knew each other, it’s on you.
@eagle1776n @darkjustin77 @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou How would that be possible to know? Some1 who has worked in US politics for decades (Devine) could have known some1 else who worked in politics, in the US and outside the US (Manafort). You’re the one with the burden of proof, for trying to say a tie exists here or doesn’t there.
@eagle1776n @darkjustin77 @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou I still don’t remember ever questioning that he worked for Bernie, lol.. you must be trolling me. Also, I’m not correct about Devine working for Gore and Kerry during their pres runs? Why does it matter that Bernie hired him after 2006 and those guys hired him before 2006?
@eagle1776n @darkjustin77 @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou I can’t help myself ahah. Just so all in this reply thread (who, btw I apologize for all this BS) knows, Tad Devine also worked for Gore’s pres run, Kerry’s pres run, Whitehouse, McCaskill, Nelson, and Menendez, among others. If he “has ties” to Bernie then so do all these ppl.
@eagle1776n @darkjustin77 @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou Dude, this is gonna be my last reply. It would serve you to learn some communication skills.. reading comprehension, and also how to construct an argument. Learning how to format the text of tweet wouldn’t hurt, either. Much love, man.
@eagle1776n @darkjustin77 @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou You tweeted “why not just admit you’re wrong” about them sharing an employee, then I asked you to show me where I said that they didn’t share an employee. You’ve shared those screenshots of the word “ties” so many times, but what does that have to do with me being wrong?
@eagle1776n @darkjustin77 @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou You keep saying I’m denying it.. can you show me where I said you were wrong about them sharing an employee? I thought we were talking about your use of the ambiguous term “have ties” in lieu of more accurate terminology.
@eagle1776n @darkjustin77 @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou Also, I’ve never seen someone quote themselves in a back-and-forth so many times. You take multiple screenshots of yourself and include them in your replies. Just commenting.. it’s an interesting way to have a conversation with someone I guess.
@eagle1776n @darkjustin77 @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou Being that you are so committed to facts and so sensitive to details and context, why does it serve you better to use the phrase “have ties” when “shared an employee” ACTUALLY describes what’s going on? “Have ties” is ambiguous. Why not convey information efficiently?
@eagle1776n @darkjustin77 @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou Have I said they didn’t share an employee? At first I did question whether you were correct, but I never said you were wrong explicitly. In that case, YOU are wrong lol. Regardless, why not stick to more straightforward terms (share an employee) when such terms exist?
@eagle1776n @darkjustin77 @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou Okay. Well if “facts matter” and you’re agreeing that you’re some kind of semi-sentient encyclopedia, why not use terms from the dictionary? Like “shared an employee”. Is “has ties” more accurate than “shared an employee”?
@eagle1776n @darkjustin77 @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou OTHER THAN simply because someone said he didn’t “have ties” and you needed to set that person straight.
@eagle1776n @darkjustin77 @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou Dude, you’ve made it clear he “has ties”. Does it matter only because someone said he didn’t have ties and you just needed to correct the record, like a human encyclopedia? Or is there another reason to be talking about it? Like, why is it so important to you?
@eagle1776n @darkjustin77 @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou ..you’re not making it easy, but I’m trying to get you to take the next step. Okay, Bernie and Manafort employed the same person for a few years. Why are you insisting on making this point so strongly? What does it mean? Why care about it?
@eagle1776n @darkjustin77 @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou So where an employee works for two employers, those employers “have ties”? Since you’re making this point so strongly, do you feel that fact implies something about the relationship between Manafort and Bernie?

@eagle1776n @darkjustin77 @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou I guess Im taking issue w/ the connotation of “has ties”.. typcly that lang is used in a derogatory way. Ur saying that ur simply sharing facts, but “has ties” doesnt really describe whats going on, does it? Saying they shared a coworker in the past would b more accurate, right?
@eagle1776n @darkjustin77 @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou So ur correcting the record, that Bernie “has ties” to Manafort because he worked w/ someone who worked w/ Manafort. I wouldn’t say that I have ties with my boss’s golf club buddies because I work for my boss.. idk if that’s “ties” as much as it shows how small DC circles are.
@eagle1776n @darkjustin77 @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou Okay, I’ll ask it another way.. why is Bernie’s connection to Manafort so important? Or are you saying now it’s not that important?
@eagle1776n @darkjustin77 @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou @eagle1776n This whole Tad thing was brought up when someone said Bernie has high favorables w/ independents and you responded citing Bernie’s connections to Manafort... if corruption wasn’t the point of pointing that out, what was?
@darkjustin77 @eagle1776n @LeftwardSwing @HillaryClinton @neeratanden @peterdaou This makes sense... Bernie is corrupt because he worked with someone who worked with someone who was corrupt. It’s too bad Bernie doesn’t have any core beliefs, he could have stood up to corruption if he saw it. It’s like 6 degrees of corruption..

@Zacc61402592 @MattLech @neeratanden He went from a demagogue to a great senator pretty quickly there.. hard to imagine those aren’t mutually exclusive, unless you yourself is a feelings over facts type.

@KevinMcGilly @hardwarehuman @jkumar820 @ForecasterEnten Listen, I replied to Harry’s tweet to comment that he mischaracterized the opposition to Pelosi. I didn’t say she wasn’t the best option on the table.. just that the unpopularity argument doesn’t speak to what I believe to be sincere and worrisome critiques of Pelosi.
@KevinMcGilly @hardwarehuman @jkumar820 @ForecasterEnten I won’t argue that Pelosi isn’t the best option given the people who have said they want the job, but you can’t show me that Pelosi is in the same place wrt the progressive agenda as those ppl I listed.

@hardwarehuman @KevinMcGilly @jkumar820 @ForecasterEnten The mischar is that the only “supposed” con is that she’s unpopular. Idgaf how unpopular she is. Politics isn’t about popularity, it’s about getting things done and doing the most good for the most people. Pelosi isnt the worst choice for speaker, but she’s not the best either.
@hardwarehuman @KevinMcGilly @jkumar820 @ForecasterEnten We never got to my actual argument, Nato. To start, Harry does not mention a single policy item in his article. Does she support Med4All? Free college? Debt forgiveness? That said, my prob with Pelosi can end and begin with PayGo. Any dem advocating paygo CANNOT lead our party.

@MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump Don’t defend and prop up Roberts or the Supreme Court, even if it’s criticizing Trump. Roberts is an uber-corporatist Republican in a black robe. The Supreme Court is corrupted to its core.. Roberts is trying to put up a “beyond partisan” facade, don’t let him get away with it.

@n4th4nRea @KevinMcGilly @ForecasterEnten Okay then.. don’t take me seriously enough to substantively reply to my critique of Harry’s tweet, but take the time to write multiple tweets making fun of me. It’s an ironic way to show that I’m not worth it, but I guess it gets you to the same place. Cheers.

@KevinMcGilly @ForecasterEnten Do you have anything substantive to say?
@mshalo18 @Ocasio2018 Are you so full of yourself that you think Alexandria was trying to change your mind with her tweet? That’s conceit if I’ve ever seen it.
@ForecasterEnten Is that really the only con that you can think of? Come on.. I take you seriously Nate, but saying things like that makes me question why you’d so blatantly mischaracterize one side of this debate
@realDonaldTrump “I’ll only go if no one will make fun of me!” Haha remember when Trump said he would have run into the school and tried to take down the gunman? He won’t attend a fancy dinner with a comedian, but he’ll tackle an armed criminal? This guy is such a joke..
@LeftwardSwing We may lose donors, but what about the people who will vote democratic now because we ditched pelosi and are showing the people that we aren’t beholden to money like she is? Losing Pelosi as speaker has its upsides, too.. they’re just not as easily measured in dollar signs.

There isnt enough nuance in JD videos to balance the approach he takes to politics.. an ambiguity of purpose that leaves too much room for interpretation. Without an objective background of intention and purpose, content is weak where it wants to b and is dangerous elsewhere
@_michaelbrooks : @jimmy_dore new video title: “DEMOCRATS in FL guilty of election fraud” LITERALLY a right-wing talking point. When I first woke to leftist YouTube I enjoyed JD, but now I can’t help but see him as more detrimental than helpful to democracy in 2018.
@NancyPelosi DO NOT handicap our progressive agenda by instituting #paygo. Y would @HouseDemocrats limit their own ability to show the people what a Democratic House + Senate + POTUS would do if we had control? We need to show why we should be in power. #paygo limits that ability
@PrdNewEnglander Bringing the majority of Southington and Berlin together like that will definitely cut out at least one Republican opportunity. House 30th is down to the wire, but it looks like Joe Arsmwtz will win. The CT SecOfState still hasn’t certified.

@ald0_sax @lpalacios347 @neeratanden Yes yes yes. Couldn’t agree more!
@lpalacios347 @neeratanden 👍the question is whether or not the 2019/20 house will have the cajones and smarts to pass a comprehensive, forward-thinking bill. Forcing the senate to either vote on or ignore a real climate change bill could bring international pressure down on the Rs too. Here’s to hoping!
@EthanObama @lpalacios347 @neeratanden If you’re saying that the house shouldn’t pass a bill because the senate won’t vote for it, I think that’s weak. democrats need to shine a light forward and show America what leadership looks like. Republicans will not give a single vote for any climate change legislation.
@EthanObama @lpalacios347 @neeratanden Sorry I wasn’t clear. When I said it doesn’t matter I mean that the possibility of republicans striking down the bill shouldn’t stop us. Their opposition to any real climate change bills will only make their ousting more probable. I do not think climate change is exaggerated.
@lpalacios347 @neeratanden It doesn’t matter. Make the senate vote it down, then you’ll have ammunition for 2020. People believe in climate change and our role in it.. it’s the smart move
@neeratanden @lpalacios347 Both things are true. Trump is an uneducated fascist animal. Democrats are supposed to be leagues ahead.. when Ds take control of the house they NEED to pass climate change legislation, or else they’re complicit in Trump’s masochism and selfishness. You can see that, right?
@mcimaps I don’t agree with everything you say, but I couldn’t agree more with this thinking. This comment is a bit meta, actually. The only caveat I would make to your statement is Hillary. She hasn’t done and wouldn’t do our party any good.
@HillaryClinton will lose to Trump in the general election again if given the chance. There’s no reason to think she’s more popular now than she was in 2016. What reason could she have in her head that would justify it? Hoping a rising blue tide will lift even sunken boats?

Shame on you, @JeffFlake. You have disappointed every single person that you inspired with your speeches about dignity and honor and courage. We were the people who heard what you said and felt uplifted to a higher moral plane.
You had a chance to embody a deep truth, Senator Flake. You could have sided with Dr Ford, or asked for an FBI investigation, or asked to subpoena Mr Judge.. but no. None of it. You couldn’t muster a drop of the dignity you apparently wear as a mask rather than truly embody.
You have done NOTHING to undo the damage Trump has caused other than by retiring from the Senate. Dr Ford has gone through so much, and you just NEED to put BK on the court? It can’t be a different judge? Why? Bc of his views on exec power? You are why Congress is so unpopular.
@JeffFlake You’ll be remembered as a JOKE. What have you actually done to stand up to Trump other than give a few spicy speeches? You have UTTERLY FAILED to live up the high-minded standards you preach.. as a matter of fact, re tangible action you’re indistinguishable from Trump.

@charliekirk11 You’re such a dummy. Seriously man, if someone told me that your brain with replaced with a simple computer program written by @SenTedCruz by accident, I would believe it.
@charliekirk11 You’re a dumb hack.
@charliekirk11 So you’re the same as Diane Feinstein? Got it.
@Ocasio2018 @emetaz Masterful, AOC! Go get ‘em 🙂
@charliekirk11 You look like a pig talking that way. For your sake, I hope that when you’re older and happen to look back on these tweets that you feel shame for the way you’re characterizing Dr Ford. If you experienced any hardship at all in your life you’d have more sympathy for her.
@jaybookmanajc @maziehirono @SenBlumenthal @SenKamalaHarris @ChrisCoons @SenatorLeahy please stay on top of breaking into like this, you only have a few days to collect everything you can
@charliekirk11 Wait a second, you JUST tweeted criticizing Hillary for not giving Broderick and Jones the benefit of the doubt. And then you wrote this tweet? You have the memory of a goldfish and the intelligence of fish food.
@charliekirk11 Source?
@charliekirk11 Dude, all you do is gossip. Are saying that those women should get that benefit? Or that they shouldn’t? Its obvious your entire point just to highlight other people’s contradictions. Of course Hilary should have treated those women better. Can U say the same about Ford?
@Ocasio2018 Haha this is hilarious.. someone in their graphics dept is definitely a closet ocasio fan.
@kanyewest Do more positive things with your money. Your positive twitter vibes aren’t having any real-world impact on their own.
@charliekirk11 @RealCandaceO @Ocasio2018 has nothing to prove to you. Why should she elevate and lift your scummy profile to her level? You wouldn’t be begging her to debate you if she didn’t have such a positive national profile.. meanwhile you’re just an ignorant Koch brothers- funded mouthpiece.

@SenSchumer If all you’re willing to do is TALK about how this “should raise concerns”, then your time is better spent elsewhere. YOU are our senate leader. YOU should raise these concerns, and fight to stop this. It’s not enough to talk about how things should be. Make them happen.
@FiveThirtyEight @NateSilver538 every day that goes by wherein I cant obsess over the 538 Senate forecast is a wasted day spent in anxious anticipation.. life would be much better spent in anxious depression over what I expect to be low odds Ds will win the Senate.   ETA? Plz? 😇

@Msmango80 @Cernovich I’m confused.. what are you suggesting we do? I keep saying that I personally would allow more immigrants and refugees into the country. Gang activity everywhere is bad. Are you pro-immigration? It sounds like your friends should be welcomed into the US right away!
@charliekirk11 hey Charlie, what was that critique of the Clinton Foundation and expenses? https://t.co/i3gwIzmN6R Care to revoke that critique, now that, by your standard, @TPUSA does WORSE than the CF? You’re a joke, Charlie.
@Msmango80 @Cernovich Immigrants are vital to our economy, they commit less crimes than native-born Americans, and they take less in social services than they provide back through taxes, on average. I would accept immigrants like the ones your talking about, no problem.
@Msmango80 @Cernovich And if your response is “immigrants have to wait while asylum seekers get priority and that’s not right” then I would agree! Be an activist and try to persuade the government to accept more immigrants. I would support your cause.
@Msmango80 @Cernovich Is your family being forced into gang activity? Are you being extorted for protection money from cartels? I’m not playing around here.. if your family is in fear for their lives then they should apply for asylum rather than trying to simply immigrate.

@TigheLikeTie @emetaz @mcimaps @PJLM @ncarper There are more social strongholds that can set an example for the rest of the US..

@DCMorgan1972 @ncarper @mcimaps For you to say that the outcome of an election has nothing to do with coverage of the candidates seems strange, though. Whether or not both candidates are “known”. We elected a “known” asshole in 2016 because of the way the media treated him.

@jeremyscahill Your @theintercept podcast today was great. I’m eager to see how Gina is examined today... though I have a feeling she will get away with holding a lot of information back on the basis of “compromising sources and methods”, an argument it takes balls to seriously counter.
@emetaz @mcimaps @PJLM @ncarper The Overton window has shifted right over the past years, but it’s also become incredibly distorted. The Dem/Rep dichotomy becomes useless when candidates from both sides are funded by the same people and hold the same corporatist value set. PJ embodies a crack in the fake window
@PJLM @emetaz @ncarper @mcimaps What you’re not understanding is that PJ’s 30% is w/o single mention on cable news, politico, NYT, or elsewhere. She got 30% without a single corporate dollar, completely crowdfunded by the grassroots. Check the OpenSecrets page for this WV race and you’ll see why PJ killed it.
@ncarper @mcimaps If Paula Jean and Dennis got the same coverage and press from the MSM than Manchin and Cordray did then I bet the results would have been a lot closer. Are you saying, for example, that Bernie got the same amount of news exposure as Hillary did? The real left doesn’t get covered.

@caramia928 I think the issue here is that you see a  “free” internet as one that is in total control exercised by ISPs, while I see a free and open internet as one that’s regulated so consumers can’t get screwed by profit-seeking companies.
@charliekirk11 Just like Trump said, “I love the poorly educated”. I guess you two are on the same level. Personally I think “we have too many young people going to college” is an insanely stupid statement. Do you have a study that shows people are better off with less education?
@charliekirk11 This tweet shows how completely disconnected you are from the ideas that BLM and Kaepernick are talking about. More police does not always mean more safe, and definitely does not mean people FEEL more safe.

@AlexEpstein What you’re noticing is absolutely true, and it’s the result of educated people relaying the fact that the hottest years ever on record are occurring year after year nowadays. There are many more higher-than-normal temp events than colder-than-normal events.
@RoKhanna @FrancisRooney Thank you for being a beacon of light in Congress, Ro. Please stay strong and vigilant in 2018.. we the people need your help.

@realDonaldTrump Come on, Don. You don’t seriously think this logic applies universally, so you? If you’re not personally harassed by cops, then police brutality isn’t real? If smoking doesn’t give you cancer, does that mean it’s safe? You’re our president! Act like it!
@charliekirk11 A political *scientist* doesn’t pick and choose the polls they consider. They aggregate and weight-average them. Trump is nowhere near 50% approval... that’s why you’re trying to show off this single poll.
@charliekirk11 So you want the government run like a business, but one that doesn’t pay its employees? Pay employees as much? Have employees with no benefits? Your philosophy is a joke.

@NomikiKonst @jjz1600 @AntiSocialstPAC @SallyAlbright You gave an anecdote illustrating just how outward-facing progressive values and activism are today, and they contort it into some personal affront on behalf of people who suffered atrocities in the name of fascism. False equivocations and nonsense just meant to rile people up.
the entire point of taxes is to provide value to money and to keep economic inequality at bay. using deficit money to provide a way for wealthy people to become more wealthy literally defeats the point of having a tax system in the first place. #modernmonetarytheory https://t.co/M77IkP8pW9
