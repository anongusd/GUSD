@RealSaavedra A tool used to end the debate.... sounds a lot like the racism accusations, etc. from her own mouth
@PardesSeleh That’s more than I make in a year
@NikkiHaley @SCNationalGuard @NGAofSC Sounds a lot like a The Police remix: 		Every breath you take	Every move you make	Every bond you break	Every step you take	I'll be watching you
@ochocinco At least u had fun😂😂 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
@NikkiHaley KIND of you!
@NikkiHaley @DanielLubetzky KIND of you to tweet!
@SethAMandel @JerylBier At the very least one should be punished commensurate to that which he conspired to do to others
@Shicktweets @tonyhawk
@johnston_kelly @RealSaavedra @IsraeliPM Amen!
@YossiGestetner @TheLeadCNN @jaketapper @LouisFarrakhan @GOPLeader @Ilhan @RJC @thealexvanness @JordanSchachtel @mkraju Besides that, you have to look at the whole picture. Trump has been extremely supportive of Israel and Jews while Ilhan has not to say the least. There is a difference between 1/2/3-offs (some are questionable) and multiple tweets that are emblematic of a real problem.

@ClastonB Yeah, it’s hard to comprehend what’s going on with some things... though, it should be an easy position to take the other side of

@AG_Conservative 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
@mcerrone @AdeleScalia 1) Big problem is this new “activism” is fine depending on who directed at- same action but different outcome	2) Another piece of no dialogue and understanding where other side coming from
@AG_Conservative Hard bc they have to overturn
@Yair_Rosenberg @FiringLineShow @MargaretHoover The PROBLEM is she speaks in broad strokes which probably means she doesn’t know anything and was brainwashed by her former co-char of the March

@lymanstoneky Hello. I said what you just retweeted here before you did
@lymanstoneky Come on. Every hot take should include the country Brazil is. Corruption reaches the highest levels of gov., murder rate is high, etc. 	Sometimes the solution for one country is not the same as it is for the US.
@PhilosopherJosh @woodypaige @SarahSpain About 4% of millennials understand this
@minakimes What is the Queen?
@AdeleScalia It’s a VERY interesting way of looking at it (my mom is from commy Russia)- not saying it’s faulty thinking. 	She has some sort of raw “talent” but commits blunder after blunder suggesting she’s just uninformed. 	Proof: aligning with two BDS supporters. Inevitable backlash

@FB_FilmAnalysis Depends what u define as “worst rule.” It surely makes the game more exciting. 	In the “spirit” of football it’s ehh. Forget starting at 20, 4 all intensive purposes it’s a turnover. 	A Touchdown is earned. Also, 1 day it will roll 10 yards in &amp; according to u what would happen?
@MikeToffel @AaronChatterji At face value this is what you should be studying. I would say, however, given typical D vs R faculty breakdown, you can’t expect it to be taught in the exact center
@FB_FilmAnalysis Easy for you to say when you’re not covering Tom Brady. Try press coverage and picking the ball off. You’d be on the next flight to the CFL
@JonahNRO That’s pretty close to what happened with Hillary vs Bernie

@Noahpinion How steadily? That could change #11. Thanks
@nicholas_c_p Great article. I would add it can’t win unless running vs less popular ideas/candidate. You just have to clear the % threshold 	Also, I assume implied is stickiness of R and D cores and fight for middle

@SecretaryZinke @POTUS @Interior Next time he shouldn’t ask his five year old to write the resignation letter
In this whole #romney saga I’m more confused by #POTUS restrained response. Why? Doesn’t want to prove Romney point in own defense? Or is this start of something new?
@Suns @DevinBook @JCrossover “I bet you I hit this. Loser gets traded to Serbia.”
@JanetheActuary Also, this should only get more worse with technology
@JanetheActuary US needs all the workers it can get and with ballooning deficits we don’t wanna push more people in retirement.
@JanetheActuary Yeah, it probably should be somewhere near that but then you’re balancing a near-impossible line of dis-incentivizing workers to work and employers to employ (if you force stuff on them).
@JanetheActuary Probably less documented is also incentive for someone younger is higher to succeed.
@JanetheActuary For all intensive purposes, it would kind of be like raising min. wage
@JanetheActuary Older workers usually are harder to teach new things, cost more and won’t spend as much time at company vs new hires. 	I think it’s the right thing to do but comes with potential unintended consequences if messing with market- less hirable.
@AdeleScalia It’s interesting. The root is how one feels about abortion. If one thinks it’s not a big deal you don’t care/agree with her shindig.... However.... it’s still nothing but utter brainwashing and imposing views on developing minds.
@AdeleScalia This is also what’s happening at colleges...

@AdeleScalia And just for a full circle, I’m currently a passenger in an Uber (Upper West Side). The driver has a 4.9 rating and says his passengers avg. a 4.6!! He then said something about America 😂
@AdeleScalia We would need Russian hackers....	All I see is Atlanta drivers have an avg. of 4.8, along with this gem of a quote:	“The result is that Uber’s ratings inflation is even worse than Harvard’s.”
@AdeleScalia Kind of your underlying point: It would be cool to look at average rating per city/state. I bet New York finishes bottom 5. Willing to take that bet?

@ForTheRuleOfLaw @LawWorksAction You have to make a stronger case than that. It should be: for the sake of the R party, the Ds will view whatever ruling as tarnished if he is in his current position.

@KassyDillon Why is it that YOU have to make this case and not @realDonaldTrump? Do the Dems have a point that 45 stopped talking about this for a reason?
@cg_shadow @xan_desanctis I meant generally, to clarify
@cg_shadow @xan_desanctis I was speaking to his position in the center; bi-partisanship is the best way forward. As to your point, that’s a fine question but not everyone agrees with that. That’s why first sentence is important.
@mkraju You think she’s carried across the finish line with Rs support by the edict of 45? If so, what happens?
@ReaganBattalion Rs should be good enough at messaging Ds as a party that will do anything to win power. IT RESONATES!
@xan_desanctis He finds himself in an awkward (and honor-worthy) position of being too far right for Ds and too far left for Rs
@kayleighmcenany Is it only worth it to find out the truth re: snipes if you lose? Do you think this is a better narrative for Rs than ‘Ds cheated and thankfully the cheater also didn’t win’?

@BillOReilly Can you please do more about @IlhanMN and anti-semitism. You can spin it however you’d like. Thanks!
@IlhanMN *And expand anti-semitism
@IlhanMN I hope not. Anti-semitism is not something to play with
@FieldYates Does this end their playoff chances?
@missrrosenberg @Ocasio2018 @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib @AyannaPressley Why? You like anti-Semitism?
@wojespn Should they tank now?
@PatrickRuffini It has to do with the candidates
@PeterSchiff What do you propose instead? Or is this simply a byproduct?
@PeterSchiff The answer lies in the question. Prices will skyrocket and fewer people will do that. Compound that with increased inconvenience and etc
@PeterSchiff It seems like misplaced discontent
@PeterSchiff There are very strong arguments as to why share buybacks are good. Unless you’re advocating that in 2016 when they didn’t know what the next two years held for them they should’ve halted repurchases idk what you’re saying.
@PatrickRuffini Interesting if you assume competitive races reflect some level of enthusiasm for the entire party. Then you compare to prior years
@RealLifeKaz The same reason you still tweet
@RavMABAY Rabbi, How could you have liked a page from @IlhanMN? Are you not familiar with her open Amit-semitism? I doubt you respond. Thanks
@PatrickRuffini Do Senate and Gov being on ballot together a lot conflate results?
@KassyDillon That’s the same trade off a lot of people are making resulting in fewer children
@IlhanMN @SenTomCotton Two suggestions:	1) Grammar	2) stop the anti-semitism
@brianschatz I would counter that @IlhanMN is for the Ds. Touché

@greggnunziata Yes. It’s the PC culture but a welcome sign. What’s equally interesting is the effect on the company’s profit. A company includes “actors” who are reflective of the demographic of watchers. Now that there has been this sharp turn, does it effect buyers? Ie resonating w consumers

@AG_Conservative It’s the near equivalent of bashing your opponent over the head with rocks until he folds. That disagreement, too, does not give credence to FACTS
@HeerJeet Don’t be so quick to spread misinformation. You have a responsibility. Thanks for owning up though
@nomadj1s @ENPancotti @bartonwillage I’m 24, my father is a Professor at Harvard and I work in investment banking at a bulge bracket bank. Please give me a chance. Thanks.
@AG_Conservative @DastDn Too late to turn back
@AG_Conservative Were they always? You realize you’re saying that the person who his/her constituents thought was best to represent them is actually ‘not our best or brightest’? Should all the constituents not take that offensively?
@YossiGestetner @GOPChairwoman The absolute amount should also reflect on the presidencies
@extrapoint13 @IlhanMN 2) when the representative from MN’s 5th speaks about Israel she  does so out of animosity to the Jewish people. 	Generally, there is no one person who holds Israel as accountable as I.
@IlhanMN 2) when the representative from MN’s 5th speaks about Israel she  does so out of animosity to the Jewish people. 	General,y, There is no one person who holds Israel as accountable as I.
@IlhanMN Fantastic question. You have to put all the pieces together. Jews and a Jewish state are one in the same. The forefront minds yelled from the hilltops that the only way a scattered People would survive would be together under their own laws. 1/
@IlhanMN You are an anti-Semite. Do not portend to be the savior of the people and turn around and hate a portion of society.
@YossiGestetner @Jamie_Weinstein @GPIngersoll @MichaelAvenatti @TuckerCarlson People believe what they want to believe. @Michaelavenat knows this and channels their worst.
@Noahpinion I can’t imagine what was written by the @NewYorkTimesGHS when Obama lost over 100% more and did exponentially worse for Senate and lower races.
@AG_Conservative Can u plz explain why #BrowardCountyFraud is so bad at such a micro level? Since it could be reflective of more activity? Why is that not the messaging?
@AdeleScalia @YahooNews Congrats on the family honor. Sabbath was long and didn’t see until now. It’s very well deserved. You being a step away from greatness doesn’t surprise me either.
@PatrickRuffini @bricey16 The downside to that is that a candidate could be on the CUSP of winning and wastes his time with the wrong crowd.
@JoyAnnReid He does this for everyone. It’s people like yourself that stoke the coals by singling these out
@KassyDillon I only black out for several days
@IlhanMN Even Jewish children?
@CleverTitleTK Agree. But only pointing finger at one seems to absolve the other
@BarstoolBigCat @AaronNagler That’s odd bc sources tell me you like freeky stuff
@attynate Just have him sit through the Super Bowl and he might change his mind
@KarinAgness Replace the word shower with person
@KassyDillon And karate-chopped the crap out of @Acosta

@minakimes @Ryan_McCrystal @Foxworth24 I would venture to also say accuracy-causing INTs (see Josh Allen) are the worst

@PatrickRuffini Don’t forget about the comment button. It’s no respectful to interject into conversations

@AG_Conservative Too bad those same standards aren’t applied by all
@AdeleScalia In Israel, there was a massive downpour of rain and my father ran a 27.1 mile marathon ;)
@Noahpinion The ease at which u say that is concerning. In no way should Lou Dobbs get away for saying that but your solution is a DISPROPORTIONATELY used tactic against one side.

@elerianm One can also argue this transitory period between QE/low rate guidance decay, etc and historically “normal” times makes it more susceptible

@cjscalia Best response I’ve seen
@CuomoPrimeTime This is irresponsible to post. Attempting to tie actions to one and mirroring act to none. Convince me “millions will die” regarding healthcare doesn’t impassion  some. @AG_Conservative @AdeleScalia @cjscalia @ClastonB.
@CuomoPrimeTime This is irresponsible to post
@GeraldoRivera As a Jew, I hope to see this more. Both for our people and all; it’s the correct set of standards to apply.
And we have the kicker https://t.co/hAsS7ntnxN
@ClastonB @AG_Conservative @AdeleScalia @cjscalia I could not agree more. Thank you.
@RonDeSantisFL @AndrewGillum @bs2223 true?
And another word to my fellow American Jews: Does the logic go that since @realDonaldTrump made a pro Israel move he is now responsible for the murder of our people? Also, note how @juliaioffe refers to Israel as “there.” I wonder what else she’s written on the topic. https://t.co/LvYQJNGD0S
