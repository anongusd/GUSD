Asked if she was tough enough to take on Trump after her speech, Klobuchar pivoted back to the snow falling around her.	 	“I am tough enough to take on Donald Trump,” she said. “I would have liked to have seen him sitting here in the snow for an hour giving this speech.” https://t.co/fZkacZc3OW
Klobuchar to reporters: "Yes, I can be tough. And yes, I can push people, I know that," she said. "I have high expectations for myself, I have high expectations for the people who work for me but I have high expectations of this country. And that is what we need." https://t.co/haobAUtf5Y

Activists are eager to remind ppl of Bloomberg’s record.		@jwestin2: “The only chance he has is that there is the rest of America that didn't actually come up in NYC @ the time when Bloomberg was pushing these racist policing policies. ... But we will definitely remind America.” https://t.co/a5mppxlmRv
Speaking at @NationalAction today, Bloomberg said he "can't stand up here and tell you every decision I have made as mayor was perfect,” but later defended his record on crime by pointing to murder statistics.		https://t.co/2DonzvavuX https://t.co/a5mppxlmRv
Bloomberg’s support of the controversial policing policy known as "stop and frisk" will loom over his campaign if he runs in 2020.		As multiple Dems noted, HRC’s record - which was an issue in ‘16 - pales in comparison to the mayor’s.		https://t.co/2DonzvavuX w/ @CristinaAlesci

Bloomberg, with a bit of bravado, later joked that he wanted to talk to Biden so he could "get some pointers about what it is like to live in DC." https://t.co/SMv7M4VR40
Both Biden &amp; Bloomberg are speaking at the @NationalAction event in DC. Bloomberg nodded to their 2020 aspirations:		“Whatever the next year brings for Joe &amp; me, I know that Joe &amp; I will keep our eye on the real prize and that is electing a Democrat to the White House in 2020."
Michael Bloomberg did not mention stop-and-frisk, the controversial policing policy that he employed as mayor, during his speech at @NationalAction, but the former mayor ended his speech saying he “can’t stand up here and tell you every decision I have made as mayor was perfect.”
Bloomberg in NAN speech: "While Rev. Sharpton and I disagree from time to time, even today, we certainly knew we could do it without being disagreeable." https://t.co/pUNNA5ym9Z
Sharpton said that Bloomberg called him the night he was first elected &amp; said, "We are not always going to agree, but I will always be accessible."		Bloomberg, Sharpton added, also promised to come to every single MLK Day event put on by NAN as mayor. And he has lived up to that. https://t.co/FOYBPOwuZj
Rev. Al Sharpton, introducing Michael Bloomberg in DC, acknowledges that they have long disagreed on stop and frisk.		"We disagreed on stop and frisk, but we agreed on education, we agreed on many other issues," Sharpton said. "Dr. King taught us to find common ground."

Many of these farmers continue to trust Trump. They believe he has a plan and want to implement it. Politically, many believe Democrats don’t understand or largely ignore their way of life, one reason the party will struggle to make inroads this year. https://t.co/Wr6l3aCjhc
Monte Peterson, a North Dakota soybean farmer, is openly wondering about why he voted for Trump. “My big picture is if China is not buying more beans than they were before, then it is not helping us,” he says from his bluff rimmed soybean fields. https://t.co/Wr6l3aCjhc
The trade war has now become a referendum on rural America’s toughness. “I don’t think the Chinese have any clue the staying power that the heartland of this country has,” said Alan Townsend, a wheat farmer from northwest Kansas. https://t.co/Wr6l3aCjhc
In conversations with more than 50 farmers, producers and agriculture experts in five states, one trend was clear: The once-deep ties to Trump have frayed over the past year. But if his re-election were held tomorrow, most of them would back the President. https://t.co/Wr6l3aCjhc

Kavanaugh just really opened the door to Dem calls to subpoena Mark Judge. Asked by VT Sen. Leahy about a detail in his book, Kavanaugh said, "You’d have to ask him." That's exactly what Leahy and Dems want.
And he finishes with a categorical denial: "I swear today under oath, before the Senate and the nation, before my family and God, I am innocent of this charge." https://t.co/243CcjH9wk
This certainly seems like the Kavanaugh that Trump would like to see, given he slammed the Democrats, called them out for statements they made and says the effort to sink him is "revenge on behalf of the Clintons”

Obama's speech here in California, while similarly thematically to his remarks in Illinois, was also quite different. The former President did not mention Trump once and largely avoided the point by point rebuke of the administration that he made on Friday.
Obama just opened his speech in Anaheim, California - a short distance from Disneyland - with a story about how he got kicked out of Disneyland for smoking cigarettes on a ride when he was in college. "This is a true story everybody, I was booted from the Magic Kingdom," he said.
Barack Obama will soon tell Democrats here in Anaheim, CA that taking back the House in November is critical to “restoring a check and balance into our political system that’s currently not providing accountability the way it’s supposed to,” an Obama aide tells CNN.

Don Blankenship, in an interview with CNN, ruled out a write in or third party bid if he doesn’t think he could be viable and when asked if a third-place finish in tonight’s Republican Senate primary met that standard, the ex-con coal baron agreed.
@rebeccagberg Maybe Tony The Tailor voted for him?

There is no television on at the party, so Blankenship just basically anchored his own election night coverage. "At this point, it is not nearly what I would have hoped it would be," he said. https://t.co/KLyi5uHVLO
This bizarre primary just gets more bizarre. Don Blankenship unexpectedly took to the stage at his primary night party to announce "the news so far is not very good." He added: "What we have seen so far is not encouraging. That doesn’t mean it won’t change."

Blankenship responds to Trump: “The President... doesn’t know me and he doesn’t know how flawed my two main opponents are in this primary.” He added: “The establishment is misinforming him because they do not want me to be in the US Senate and promote the President’s agenda.”

The U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs last month, much more than expected.l and the best month since July 2016. The unemployment rate remained at 4.1%.
A senior administration official told reporters tonight that the message from Kim Jong Un was not conveyed by written letter, but by a message through the South Koreans: "This was a message conveyed orally by Kim Jong Un to the national security adviser of South Korea."

.@PressSec says human rights 'briefly came up' during the Trump-Duterte bilat: "The conversation focused on ISIS, illegal drugs, and trade. Human rights briefly came up in the context of the Philippines’ fight against illegal drugs."

Trump and Duterte ignore questions on human rights as they sit down for talks. When reporters shouted questions, Duterte interjected, "We are not answering, this is not a press statement. We are in a bilateral meeting."
Trump, touting the reception he has received in Asia, tells reporters that it has been "a red carpet like nobody, I think, has probably ever seen." He adds, "And that really is a sign of respect, perhaps for me a little bit, but really for our country."
