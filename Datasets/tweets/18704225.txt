@MolotovMondays @johnlundin @cilla4ever @LindseyGrahamSC I'd answer but I'm laughing too hard. Apparently you didn't learn about the enumerated powers of the federal government and how everything NOT listed was the responsibility of the states.
@MolotovMondays @johnlundin @cilla4ever @LindseyGrahamSC That doesn't change my original comment. The federal government was formed to provide for a common defense among the states. School funding came later. Schools wouldn't need as much federal funding if they didn't have to educate so many children who came here illegally.
@MolotovMondays @johnlundin @cilla4ever @LindseyGrahamSC New buildings are funded by bonds.
@MolotovMondays @johnlundin @cilla4ever @LindseyGrahamSC Where do you get that? In Texas, they are primarily funded by local property taxes, and state dollars. There are some federal funds for certain programs like meals. I think you should look into this deeper.
@MolotovMondays @johnlundin @cilla4ever @LindseyGrahamSC No. The federal government just shouldn't pay for them.

@stefanyy33 @ArnabBanerjiUSA @TexasTribune @PatrickSvitek You are purposely twisting my example to say something I'm not saying. That is an example of an administrative check to ensure they are eligible to vote. If they move to another state they are removed from the rolls. Removal from the rolls doesn't remove the right to vote.
@ArnabBanerjiUSA @TexasTribune @PatrickSvitek You really can't see your own bias, can you? It still amazes me. Abbott didn't instigate it and it certainly wasn't done to give the President something to tweet. Please let's keep going because this is looking good for my side.

I think you are looking for things to be angry about. It smacks of a victim mentality. Do you want ineligible voters on the rolls???
@ArnabBanerjiUSA @TexasTribune @PatrickSvitek Yes, if they aren't eligible to vote they should be taken off the rolls. If they are I absolutely want them on the rolls. Save the mind-reading. You aren't good at it.
@ArnabBanerjiUSA @TexasTribune @PatrickSvitek No. I don't see the issue. This isn't based on ethnicity. It's paperwork. They just want to check that the paperwork is in order. That's all. It's just a verification. I wouldn't care if my name was on the list. I would show them my birth certificate and it would be done.
@ArnabBanerjiUSA @TexasTribune @PatrickSvitek No. Have you ever worked an election?
@ArnabBanerjiUSA @TexasTribune @PatrickSvitek In fact, it's standard practice that if a person moves with without changing address and the reg card is returned that they be put on suspense until they provide their new address. It's too verify each voter is eligible to vote in the correct district.

@soopervillain @rolandscahill @realDonaldTrump It's Friday night. TDS victims won't be getting any.ore of my attention.
@soopervillain @rolandscahill @realDonaldTrump None of which I called you.
@soopervillain @rolandscahill @realDonaldTrump I never get tired of Trump Derangement Syndrome.
@soopervillain @rolandscahill @realDonaldTrump I learned that the Fed raising interest rates when there is no inflation stifles the economy. 		You don't know how my 401(k) works. But it increased by a lot. I'm still in positive territory. I haven't lost money.
@soopervillain @rolandscahill @realDonaldTrump It's fine because I did so well last year. It almost doubled. If you think this will cause a recession to need to study macroeconomics again.
@soopervillain @rolandscahill @realDonaldTrump Don't confuse legal immigration and illegal immigration. Two different things. People who cross borders illegally and climb over fences probably won't be starting businesses. Just come in legally. Better yet, work to make you own home better.
@Cease_andresist @rolandscahill @realDonaldTrump Seems like you are saying that. I didn't say that. I didn't say anything close to that.
@Snarknado8 @rolandscahill @realDonaldTrump You'd think not, but here they are. I see at least one every day.
@Cease_andresist @rolandscahill @realDonaldTrump It changes every day. I don't give numbers any power. Why did you bother to black out my face when anyone can see it by going to my profile? Weird.
@Cease_andresist @rolandscahill @realDonaldTrump It's not a complete solution. No one thing will ever be a complete solution.
@soopervillain @rolandscahill @realDonaldTrump Living in the United States isn't a human right.
@Snarknado8 @rolandscahill @realDonaldTrump If you are trying to be a mind-reader you need to try again.

@ABPatriotWriter @Abdi_Ali96 @GregAbbott_TX If y'all insist on being so far off the topic, feel free to take my handle off.
@ABPatriotWriter @GregAbbott_TX That's not what the law says. It says no contracts with those who boycott Israel. That is different than supporting terrorist organizations.
@Tea4gunsSC @GregAbbott_TX I you misunderstood me. Free speech is protesting Israel if you want. I think the law was intended to apply to businesses, but it's being applied to individuals.
@GregAbbott_TX I'm 100% in support of Israel, but I believe this is an infringement on free speech. I've tried every way to justify this law in my mind, but I just can't. Free speech is a principle that ensures our American way of life.

@GrumpAdam @APCentralRegion My point here is that he's not more or less guilty because he's associated with Baylor. The facts of the case determined this outcome.
@GrumpAdam @APCentralRegion I did not say that at all. I saw nothing about anal rape (and this is local news to me). I'm 100% in support of open carry for everyone. I'm saying that it could have been prevented. I'm also saying that juries look at such things. That's a FAR cry from saying she had it coming.
@GrumpAdam @APCentralRegion My daughter, if I had one, would know not to go to a frat party drink, kiss and grind on some guy and then follow him out behind a tent. The dangerous men aren't the ones who have been caught. They are the ones who haven't.
@ScottAdamsSays No. I believe the 3D printer is an over expensive step. Let's go with hempcrete. I'm hearing good things.
@APCentralRegion Sounds like there is a thought that he should have been convicted merely because he attended Baylor. Nevermind the conflicting facts of the case.

@ProgressEconomy @MperiousRex Our diff in opinion is that I believe ppl shld control their money. You believe govt shld control the money.
@ProgressEconomy @MperiousRex The difference isn't between household budgets and govt budgets. It's whether it's the govt's or citizen's $$
@ProgressEconomy Is that how you manage your personal budget? Do you borrow money to pay for money you borrowed in the past?
@ProgressEconomy Faulty thinking. If you keep the limit the same, you lower current spending to pay past bills.
@TonyFratto @pfeiffer44 Higher limit --&gt; more debt. Less spending --&gt; less debt. The president wants a higher limit for more spending.
@TonyFratto @pfeiffer44 I understand the debt ceiling very well. Raise the limit on the credit card and a person can go more in debt.
There won't be any default. Just like your own money mgmt, it's about priorities.
@TonyFratto @pfeiffer44 The White House wants it. There are some who don't want the White House to have it. That makes it a "give" to the WH
RT @TonyFratto: That's the point on this: raising the debt ceiling isn't a "give" to the White House.  Treating it that way is bizarre.

@kilgirltrout We were having a nice discourse until this. I wasn't but my coworker's grandchild was. It's becoming more and more common.

@MarcyTanter @TXDemParty Doctors are protected in current law and this law. Now you're stretching. God bless and keep you, Marcy.
@MarcyTanter @TXDemParty There's a provision for the health of the mother in the bill.
@kilgirltrout I completely agree, but 800 citizens spent the night at the capitol to fight for that right.
@kilgirltrout That is conventional wisdom. Not medical evidence. Babies have been born and had normal healthy lives at 23 or 24 weeks.
@MarcyTanter @TXDemParty If it's not happening then why not let them ban it? Why fight so hard to keep them from banning it?
@kilgirltrout I'm looking at one specific bill. Actually, one specific provision of one bill. I don't see it should be legal.
@MarcyTanter @TXDemParty It's for a reason: the mother doesn't want the baby. Abortions under 12 weeks would still be legal.
@MarcyTanter @TXDemParty If a child is viable or near-viable, it's not their body anymore.
