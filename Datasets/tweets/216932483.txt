Numbers 12:1 (NIV life Application Study Bible)
If you are unjustly criticized, remember that your critics may be afraid to face the real problem. Don‚Äôt take his type of criticism personally. Ask God to help you identify the real issue and deal with it.  #AMEN #MAGA
When you are in a disagreement, stop and ask yourself if you are arguing over the real issue or if you have introduced a smokescreen by attacking someone‚Äôs character.
Rather than face the problem squarely by dealing with heir envy and pride, they chose to create a diversion from the real issue.
The real issue was their growing jealousy of Moses‚Äôs position and influence. Since they could not find fault with the way Moses was leading the people, they chose to criticize his wife.
People often  argue over minor disagreements, leaving the real issue untouched. Such was the case when Miriam and Aaron came to Moses with a complaint. They represented the priests and the prophets, the two most powerful groups next to Moses.
34 And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.
Numbers 11:33,34 (KJV) And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the  LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.
We need 2 learn 2 take our problems 2 the One who can do something about them. Complaining 2 one another accomplishes nothing.

4 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?
3 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them.
2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, he fire was quenched.
Numbers 11:1-6 (KJV) And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them in the uttermost parts of the camp.
@principalb83 @usedgov @BetsyDeVosED Most of education dollars goes to teacher pensions. That is the waste. I suggest no school taxes. Until then, I suggest school vouchers to allow the parents to choose the education   Institution for their child to learn. Private and public should be the same. That‚Äôs equality.
@usedgov @BetsyDeVosED If all students deserve the same education why are there still private institutions only the ‚Äúrich‚Äù can afford? Where is equality?

@SilviaxLej @Free_Media_Hub @WhiteHouse Universal healthcare is not real. What does it matter what ‚Äúplace‚Äù America is when it comes to healthcare? America worry about Americans.

@SilviaxLej @DOPO3536 @Free_Media_Hub @WhiteHouse Have you ever got a ticket for anything? That pays plenty. Check out the judiciary system. Millions of money brought in by those that get in trouble with the law. It‚Äôs all distributed. Follow the money.

Hey #PaVoters. It‚Äôs time parents have a choice and a voice on their children‚Äôs education. Vote yes for school #vouchers. Enough big government and big union control. The child‚Äôs education has been lost in the mix. https://t.co/Zw1Z3PdyRv
@EdFuller_PSU @edlawcenterpa @EdVotersPA @MaryNied @publicsource And as far as vouchers. I‚Äôm sure vouchers work well with many students. Where is the research on those succeeding? Of course they focus on those not succeeding. Government is losing money when I child leaves public education for a private one. I‚Äôm all for a #PaVoucher. Choice.
@EdFuller_PSU @edlawcenterpa @EdVotersPA @MaryNied @publicsource Increased funding is not the answer. Getting control of spending is. The focus of the children has become lost. Government control has taken over. It‚Äôs disgusting and scary to witness. It‚Äôs a mess. Restructuring is a start. Unions need to go. PSSA‚Äôs need to go. A lot needs fixed.
@EdFuller_PSU @edlawcenterpa @EdVotersPA @MaryNied @publicsource True. We are paying mostly pensions, not much students education. Failed Common Core. Public education is not what it used to be. Minimal learning. As a parent &amp; educational advocate of my three elementary age school children I know first hand how utterly rediculous public ed is.

James 4:6 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble. üíù
3 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.
2 Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and can not obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.
James 4:1-3 (KJV) From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?
