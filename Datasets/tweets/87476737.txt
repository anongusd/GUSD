Very animated doctor talking about 'flight or fight' mechanism. Moving hands as he describes to judge directly, as if teaching or lecturing

Reeva's mom and half-sister come back into court from side door, slide into a bench. During the case they've been stoic, quietly observing
Derman has papers neatly laid out before him, an open file. He reads from one set of papers in a measured voice, slightly swaying
Wayne Derman: standing in dock, seems in command of his evidence and knowledge. His body language is confident, relaxed. Seems to enjoy this
Doctor: #oscarpistorius is anxious, tremor of the hands and has a sleep disorder.
Sports doctor lists #OscarPistorius health issues but it's his stumps that are the most problematic. Prone to infections, bleeding.
What is clear - Derman has spent a considerable amount of time with #oscarpistorius before and after the shooting.
Defence focusing on sports psych Derman because he can talk about the way people (and amputees) unconsciously respond to stress, adrenalin

This is so key. The 'state' of mind of #oscarpistorius before and during the shooting. Whether the court judges him to different standards
#OscarPistorius defence arguing against  putting him under 'observation' #anxietyDisorder
Nel: suggesting #oscarpistorius is 'anxious' because his case not going well. Timing of psychiatric report questioned.
State seem to be suggesting #oscarpistorius be observed in a psychiatric hospital?
#OscarPistorius sits with head bowed as his mental state is picked apart by state and psychiatrist.
Witness: #oscarpistorius reaction to situations will be different because of his vulnerability, anxiety. Links to culpable homicide charge
Dr Voster: stands in the dock. Short hair. Black jacket. Drinks water. Straight talking. Confident. #OscarPistorius
Witness: because of his disability #oscarpistorius would 'fight' not 'flight' because he would do be able to flee.
Witness: #oscarpistorius disability makes him vulnerable. Anxiety makes him want to conceal vulnerability.
Psychiatrist: ability to walk on without prosthesis is poor
Psychiatrist: #oscarpistorius is depressed. Has no intellectual incapacity.
Psychiatrist: #oscarpistorius emotions and retching are genuine.
As a teenager, when his mother suddenly died, #oscarpistorius had no other primary attachment figure and so became more anxious: witness
Psychiatrist: #OscarPistorius mother did not 'sooth' her kids, amplified their anxiety. 'Reared to see external environment as threatening'
As a child #Oscarpistorius was encouraged to be 'normal' - but as he got older this would have caused anxiety

Defence: #oscarpistorius says he did not fire a shot through the sunroof of a car.
Defence: did you cheat on #OscarPistorius?  To Taylor
Defence. How did you feel about your breakup with #oscarpistorius? Taylor says she was upset and then cries. So court adjourns again.
#oscarpistorius passes a note to his defence team.
Defence: relating to #Oscarpistorius being fearful and scared. Do you remember being pursued and followed. Taylor says yes.
Taylor: #OscarPistorius could walk on stumps. But needed to balance sometime on something.
Defence: #OscarPistorius was receiving treatment for a sore shoulder. So that's why he slept on the left side that night.
Defence: can you really remember that day? #sunroofshooting #samanthataylor
Taylor: very vague and unsure about timings and geography. Gives short, softly spoken answers. #oscarpistorius #sunroofshooting
Taylor: I only heard him screaming in anger not when his life was threatened.
Taylor: cries within minutes of cross examination starting. Court adjourns.
Defence: we will show emails proving you were not still in a relationship with #OscarPistorius when he took Reeva out
Taylor: the relationship ended when #oscarpistorius cheated on me with Reeva Steenkamp.
#oscarpistorius screamed at me, my sister, my best friend, his best friend: Taylor
Taylor: driver and #oscarpistorius laughed after shooting out of sunroof.
Taylor: #oscarpistorius shot a bullet out of the sunroof of the car. As it was being driven
Taylor: relates an incident when #oscarpistorius 'shouted' at policeman for touching his gun
Taylor: he shouted at me.
Taylor: he sounds like a man when he screams. I have heard him.
Taylor: he often used his cellphone at night. To message people. And he had an ipad.
Taylor: at night #oscarpistorius kept his legs and gun on right hand side of the bed.
Taylor: #oscarpistorius kept his gun on him all the time.
Taylor: I spent about 4 days a week at his home.
Taylor: I started dating #oscarpistorius when I was 17.
Witness called. Samantha Taylor. #oscarpistorius ex-girlfriend
State: concluded by trying to use doctor's testimony to pick apart #OscarPistorius bail statement.
State: pushing on the timeframe if the screams the doctor heard. #OscarPistorius
State now going to 'give defence's version'
Again: the issue of whether or not gunshots and cricket bat hitting the door sound the same #oscarpistorius.
Defence says #oscarpistorius doesn't remember telling the doctor 'I shot her I thought she was a burglar' when he arrived at the scene
Defence: the toilet is a closed space and the window was closed. You wouldn't have heard screaming from inside. #OscaPistorius
In the courtroom. Defence continues to cross examination the doctor/neighbour.  #OscarPistorius
My view while going live. Peter Rudden, our cameraman,has uncanny ability to match Hawaiian shirts and plaid shorts http://t.co/vCRfyrNjY4
Pistorius breaks down at graphic evidence http://t.co/q52I07g28n
#oscarpistorius bodyguards ready to help him leave court. Protect him from media and public scrum outside.
Court done for the day. #oscarpistorius seems tearful. Been comforted by his sister. Getting ready to leave court
Defence: getting clarification on when lights in the house/bathroom were on or off #oscarpistorius
Dr: #oscarpistorius looked sincere, tears on face. Besides himself. He tried to help Reeva by actively trying to open her airway.
Dr: #oscarpistorius very very distraught. Crying to God for Reeva to live. Like asking for atonement on the scene
Defence brings up witness 2 who said she thought a women was crying and her husband said it was #oscarpistorius.
RT @NastasyaTay: Arguments deteriorate beyond common cause (that #OscarPistorius fired 4 shots). So just how many shots were there? Roux &amp; ‚Ä¶
State: she was killed by second set of sounds (shots) at 3.17. Defence: how can that be? Is state suggestion there were extra shots fired?
Shots at 3.17 caused Reeva's death: State. Arguing with each other to the judge about amount of shots and their cases.
State objects - this is not a fact. #oscarpistorius.
Dr: but voices were intermingled.
Defence: could it be that #oscarpistorius voice resembles a women's scream? Expert will prove this.
Defence: who screamed? Couldn't have been Reeva because of the head wound. Not medically possible.
Defence: Reeva's head wound was devestating...fatal...wouldn't be able to scream after it. #oscarpistorius
Again - the defence is arguing what the dr heard was the cricket bat hitting the door and not the shots. #oscarpistorius.
This doctor witness is composed. Centred. #oscarpistorius.
Doctor now being cross examined. Questioning how Hilton Botha stamped a statement made when he was not present#oscarpistorius

State: refutes that immediately.
Defence: If your version is correct the deceased would have been in a locked toilet - you could not have heard her #OscarPistorius
Defence: let me put it to you the screaming you heard was Mr Pistorius. Neighbour: I have difficulty accepting this 'speculation'
Legal experts and others I have spoken to say Roux's performance in court is a 'master class in cross examination' #oscarpistorius
Neighbour not loosing his cool though. Seems stronger, more confident than yesterday. His every word is reanalysed and thrown back at him.
Defence being quite snarky about neighbour saying he had 'acute and sharp' senses by reminding him of what he can't remember#oscarpistorius
Defence bring quite snarky about neighbour saying he had 'acute and sharp' senses by reminding him of what he can't remember#oscarpistorius
Neighbour to judge: can't believe a cricket bat hitting a door sounds like a rapid succession of gunshots #oscarpistorius
Defence to neighbour: I put you that what you heard was the sound of the cricket bat hitting the door ( not gunshots). #oscarpistorius

Lerena: I didn't tell anyone about the incident until after Valentines Day
Lerena: #oscarpistorius apologized.
Lerena: gun went off after the words 'one up' were said. (Meaning one bullet in chamber he says)
Lerena: gun passed under table.
Court shown where group was seated inside restaurant. #oscarpistorius
Lerena: we were at Tasha's restaurant with 3 others including #oscarpistorius
Witness 3 excused for now. Kevin Lerena now called. #oscarpistorius friend and witness to the 'gun incident' at Tasha's restaurant.
Arrived in court. Looks like a cricket bat wrapped in plastic is lying on table near #oscarpistorius
Defence: argue to court that it's too 'remarkable' the husband and wife witnesses have same evidence/testimony. #oscarpistorius
Witness 3: all the witnesses are congregated together in the same room in the court.
Witness 3: Scream heard during volley of shots. And final scream faded with last shot. Heard '5 or 6' shots. #oscarpistorius
Witness 3. Heard female voice shout help. Then a male voice shout help more than once.
Witness 3. Describes hearing screams. Jumped up and went to balcony.
Third interpreter dispensed with. This time within minutes. By the state. Witness now talks softly in English.
Next witness now up. Charl Johnson. Husband of witness 1. Neighbor. #oscarpistorius
'Groot geskrik:' I had a terrible fright. Paralysed, shock. When she heard the 'shots' It's possible that's why doesn't remember details
'Ek kannie onthou' - a familar statement from this neighbour. ('I can't remember' in Afrikaans) She seems nervous, unsure #oscarpistorius
This witness can't seem to remember much detail. #oscarpistorius
Probing on what witness can and can't remember about the sounds and 'shots' that morning. #OscarPistorius
Back in court. Defense continues to cross examine another neighbor. #OscarPistorius
Adjourned. #oscarpistorius

Witness: after the sounds her husband woke up. He told her they were gun shots. Then heard a 'commotion' #oscarpistorius
Witness: heard 4 sounds (discrepency of what exactly) at 3am #oscarpistorius
Witness: 'irritated' by the sounds. Placed a pillow over my head to try sleep
Woke up to sounds of a fight. Loud voices. Lasted for an hour. Couldn't hear what was said. Couldn't hear what language. #oscarpistorius
Witness 2, van der Merwe is another neighbour #oscarpistorius
She also wants to only give evidence off camera and in Afrikaans. Interpreter seems far more confident than yesterday. #oscarpistorius
Next witness: Estelle van der Merwe.
Witness 1 cries. Breaks down. Describes how she relives the 'terrifying screams' #oscarpistorius.

Witness 1: identifies her house and the distance from #oscarpistorius home on a map in the court.
Witness 1: she thought there was an attack at the house
Heard a scream after shots. Describes the 'bang, bang, bang, bang' of the shots. #oscarpistorius
Witness 1 saying she heard more screams. Worse more intense. #oscarpistorius
#oscarpistorius listens, looks and takes notes as Witness 1 says she heard screams that night.
Witness 1: I dialled security and then gave the phone to my husband to talk to them.
Witness 1. She screamed terribly and yelled for help. I heard a man also screaming for help, three times.
Witness 1: says she and her husband was woken up by a woman screaming at about 3am.
Witness 1: she lived near #oscarpistorius. Starts off saying Valentines Day evening she went to sleep between 9-10.
Witness 1: Michelle Burger. #oscarpistorius is young, brown hair pulled off face. Won't testify on camera. Speaking Afrikaans.
State: witness is Michelle Burger. But I can't find her name on witness list?
State: calls first witness.
Oi - maybe the number was the date of her death. Correction (I think).
State: talking about post mortem and the procedural number allocated to Reeva's body. Her family stare ahead.
State now addressing judge. The gloves are off in this legal battle #oscarpistorius
#OscarPistorius legal team has come out with a hard hitting, emphatic and detailed opening explanation.
#OscarPistorius defence: again emphasizes there was no argument and he didn't intend to kill Reeva
#OscarPistorius defence: his home and scene of shooting was 'contaminated disturbed and tampered with' by police.
#OscarPistorius defence refutes state suggestion that there was an argument between them.

#mandelawill: valued provisionally at about 4 million dollars, says executors.
My understanding of MandelaWill: Mandela's wife, Graca Machel, only receives what he left her specifically in the will - nothing else.
