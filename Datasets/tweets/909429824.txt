@NextRevFNC @charliekirk11 The Democrats are a disgrace, their hatred drives everything they do. I just don't understand how the independents who decide every election could give them back the house so this obstruction  could continue. I do know Paul Ryan failed to fund those running to replace retirements
@NextRevFNC @charliekirk11 My point of view on this is it is hard enough to negotiate with someone like Kim, so why would the Democrats pick that day to slander the president once again?  I mean there is contradictory video on everything Cohen said so the only excuse was to scuttle the negotiations.
This article identifies 200 people I happen to know are US Citizens with the possible exception of one.  One person who lost her account had a profile image with her standing next to the president https://t.co/Szzv4sH3xm
Hillary Clinton retweeted this article making everyone on this hit list a target for groups who do nothing but spend their time harassing conservatives online.  I thought 401C3's and 4 were supposed to be neutral.  Left wing groups getting that tax break are anything but neutral.
@NextRevFNC Tired of the lefts attempts to silence us.  We are US Citizens who volunteered to make memes and prevent Hillary from winning.  What I want to know is when are she and her followers going accept the results of the 2016 election and stop resisting? https://t.co/1klRly9QJ1

@land0locked Yes, and I am not happy about it.
@LisaMei62 @YRJewelryGal @prayingmedic I am on the list, may have retweeted that hashtag but I don't recall ever actually using it, not everyone on that list used that hashtag. I do make memes &amp;I did chronicle why Hillary lost.  I know that David Brock was after me for a while, but not for using a particular hashtag.
@PaulaLanier54 @POTUS I am fed up with the "new prophets" on the media.  How would he know what the @POTUS is happy with?  I am pretty sure with the way he has talked down DJT that he has no inside information.  This speculation must be stopped, it stirs up discontent and violence from the left.
@Tonyandsannonw2 @TamaraLeigh_llc @HillaryClinton @politico It might be my military training which served me well in my career efforts.  I don't fold for anyone period.  I don't make threats like the left does, and I don't use vulgarity to get my point across.  I research and post Truth and if they don't like it too bad.
@TamaraLeigh_llc @HillaryClinton @politico I didn't lose my account like you did Tamara, this has gone far enough.  The left controls the schools, the colleges, the media and now they are attempting to control the internet.  It must be stopped.  We need to find out who paid for this study.

@JeffLee2020 @4realdk @RealJamesWoods Worse than that, in some cases housing we finance via HUD under Section 8 are going to illegals and displacing Americans in need.  At least that was the case up until 2 years ago.  Not sure if they fixed it yet or not.
@RealJamesWoods Don't you find it a bit ironic that the same party, the #DNC that stands against all immigrants for the Native Americans (utter BS they tried to wipe us out with forced sterilizations on the reservations until the '80s), are now the ones advocating for open borders?  Skitzo.

@RealJamesWoods Some things just were not meant to be seen.  This is one of them.  Ladies hip huggers make everyone's ass look big no matter how thin you are.
@RealJamesWoods Other than everything?  The hubris of mankind especially those calling themselves a scientist.  You start messing with nature and you are asking for disaster.  What do they plan to do, aim a nuke at the sun?

@realDonaldTrump It makes me nervous that he said anything at all o this topic.  Leftist judges have changed our laws for decades and we all know it.  I can't find anything in the constituion I have that allows for abortion but they found it somehow.

@RealJamesWoods Eventually, they realize that getting a job is the only way they get away from parental rules. Most children by age 17 are starting to revolt against being told what to do by their parents, it is natural but should not continue until age 30
@RealJamesWoods Socialism only worked in her parents home, where they provided for her living quarters, her food and her clothing.  The reason it is so attractive to the young is they are afraid to try it on their own.
