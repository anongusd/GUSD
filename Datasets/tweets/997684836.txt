@BDayspring @thepugdc @JoeHeim Fwiw, I came to personally value Harper over Manny because of organizational need of lefty power and CBP being tailor made for lefty bats. 	And Bryce’s contract is dramatically better for team (signing Trout!) than Manny’s with Pads.

@jonallendc And yet you're angry he went to Philly, right? This is the thing I seen from Nats fans over &amp; over: "He stinks, he's not worth the $$$$ but man I'm furious he went to Philly!"	If he's that bad, you should be glad he went to Phils.
@paulschwartzman Oh wow, that was the brutal 2015 freefall for the Nats (and Mets surge), ending with Pap trying to strangle him. I wonder if Matt Williams has finally ever learned that 2 players in his dugout got into a brawl!
@frates ... Conversely, imagine how Harp reacts when the Phanatics give him a standing-O because he hustled down to 2B and broke up a double-play, leading to a 2-out rally? He's never played for fans like that. Let's see how this goes.
@frates All this is right, from the past up until now. But if Harp is ever going to become the player many of think he can be, he has to leave DC -- he has to leave a team management &amp; fan base that coddled him. Are Phils phans going to boo him when he misses cutoff man? Absolutely. ...

@GlennThrush It's only Day 35 of shutdown, but honestly, I had to look at C-Span to know that. We've all lost track.
@JakeSherman Also, if it is a 3-week CR, this means House Dem retreat is canceled, almost certainly canceled, because final days before next possible shutdown would be while they're supposed to be on retreat (2/13-2/15).
@HarrySteinDC But that would still require passing in Senate, calling House back into session tomorrow or Sunday to pass that. Quickest path, as @nielslesniewski and I note, is to either pass bills already approved by House (CRs to Feb. 8 or 28), president signing them tonight.
Slight caution here: a 3-week CR would set Feb 15 deadline, for which there's no existing legislation. Easiest path is Senate to take up House's CR to Feb 28, pass it today, Trump sign tonight, gov't reopened. 	A 3-week CR would also cancel House Dem retreat (2/13-2/15).

@rokumar1918 @ahrferrier @jaketapper @mateagold Which is why McConnell is staying far away from all this, because there's no deal to be cut. Read my analysis in full here:	https://t.co/Zg2CVyyJ10
@rokumar1918 @ahrferrier @jaketapper @mateagold A vote on any bill reopening gov't right now -- with Trump threatening a veto -- has nowhere near 67 votes, nowhere near 60 votes. Rs will not break from Trump, maybe 3 or 4 would actually vote against him on this issue. Until Trump wants a deal, we're nowhere.
@ahrferrier @mkady But Marty, what you just outlined wouldn’t be a deal. Your suggestion was McConnell put Approps bills on floor. They might - might - get 3-4 R votes for those. Might. That’s not a deal. That’s failure.

@StewSays @BNightengale I hear ya, Stew, but I've been a longtime believer that Boras is using the Phillies to jack up the $$$ from the Lerners. Boras has always wanted the Phils to be the last, highest bidder - so that Boras than cranks out the final millions from the Lerners.
In wild card round, home teams are just 19-17 in last 9 playoffs. They aren't rested, plus they end up playing a "hot" wild card team (Colts, Chargers, Eagles). But that "hot" team goes cold against 1 &amp; 2 seeds. 2/2
Reupping this from last night. If Pats win, as looks likely, Nos. 1 &amp; 2 seeds will go to 26-9 in last 9 divisional round of NFL playoffs. It's really hard to beat a team that's rested &amp; playing at home. 1/2 https://t.co/1V7D1kz8df

@lurie_john Again, none of this shows again bad teams like Jazz. Then he disappears against the Celtics and great teams.
@lurie_john Sixers committed 4 turnovers in a 3-minute span, 3 of them directly related to when Simmons used his right hand to dribble or pass. When he gets easy rebounds underneath for offensive putbacks, he kicks them outside if he has to shoot righty.
@DocD19 He won't shoot 3's because he has a weird hand issue. He doesn't know what to do with his right hand, how to hold it. Watch closely - he can't throw a right handed pass. His righty "floaters" are just prayers. He's amazing. But Brad Stevens figured all this out.
@lurie_john Has the capability to be the greatest Sixer ever, no doubt. I just want to see him develop a stronger right hand and it will help him get there. Just watch this game, it's all left handed. Amazing as it is, his one-handed nature kills him against good-great teams.
Listening to NBA broadcasters discuss Ben Simmons is so bizarre. They don't recognize what's blindingly obvious - he has no right hand. He struggles to dribble with his right, avoids passing righty whenever possible. It's his Achilles. Yet no one talks about it.

@cbrentcolburn Totally agree. Which is why this lack of concern is so odd. You were at HUD during '13 shutdown, right? Night of that shutdown, House &amp; Senate stayed in past midnight, furiously trying to appear as if they were trying hard, you know, for the people. Tonight? Not so much.
Weirdest shutdown I've covered. Little energy expended publicly by principals (staff working butts off behind scenes). Ryan, McConnell, Schumer, all gone before 8 pm. Pence put up smokescreen as if real talks were happening in his office off Senate floor. He left 10 mins ago. https://t.co/3fJjvAqJPy
The Senate adjourned about 8 pm, setting in motion the shutdown in less than 4 hours.
@PoliticsReid @DougHeye @DCStreetcar I would love to own a superstore that sold Guinness.
Depts of Ag, Commerce, Homeland, HUD, Interior, Justice, State, Treasury &amp; Trans will at least partially close. EPA, FCC, FTC, CFPB and SEC will lapse funding. Same with federal court system. -30-
Incredibly slim chance the Senate could reach a deal late tonight, but even if it were to pass, House would take it up tomorrow, beginning at noon. 	This is a partial shutdown, but important agencies will lapse funding: ...
The House has adjourned until noon Saturday.	There is definitely a gov't shutdown beginning at midnight. How long? TBD.

@dcbigjohn @BresPolitico @DaviSusan @DanaBashCNN It took a side text from @PoliticsReid for me to understand this. Still really weird. And I am Mr. Hand. "Are you all on drugs?"
@studentactivism No, I made it about the past 2 election cycles. I pointed out all the DSCC candidates of past 2 cycles, and contrasted them with the great DCCC recruits this cycle. I'm actually advocating for more non-establishment candidates in open primaries. Go read original tweet.
@studentactivism You're overly fixating on Mississippi right now, not looking at the trend and what this means for 2020. I'm arguing Dems need more unconventional figures in Senate races. And liberal Twitter - which hates establishment Ds clearing primaries - hates this point. So weird.
@dcbigjohn @BresPolitico @DaviSusan @DanaBashCNN Are you all on drugs? What is happening? When did I become Mr Hand?
@studentactivism I think the real Q is where Senate Dems go from here in recruiting. Espy did good, but not great. Any chance at 2020 majority requires winning 1-2 “reach” states. They need fewer Strickland types, more Colin Allred/Mikie Sherrills.
@joshtpm In NV and AZ Senate DSCC went with somewhat new faces, dynamic candidates. Yes. Beto self recruited. But over and over Senate Ds go with Strickland/Bayh types. That model appears toast.
@joshtpm Every state, every race is different, Josh. For sure. I’m just pointing out a clear difference in DCCC v DSCC in tough races. House Ds found unique figures. Senate Ds reflexively go for elder statesmen &amp; then clear primary. It’s a fact.
@studentactivism I am merely pointing out that the path to actually winning is more candidates like Colin Allred, less like Espy. This was a cycle where fresh faces with great backgrounds won in tough places. Or, conversely, Beto did a helluva lot better than Bredesen, Bayh, Strickland.
RT @seungminkim: &gt;&gt; https://t.co/koTGZIOiqi
@NilsAParker Exactly. Heitkamp 2012 was incredibly authentic and new. By 2018, not so much. In 2020 Dems will need a Mikie Sherrill type vs Tillis and a Jason Crow type vs Gardner. Not some former Gov.
@NilsAParker 4-5 years ago I’d have said Bredesen, Strickland, Espy were great candidates. Not now. Those that can win are younger, nonpolitical backgrounds. Replicate what House Dems did. That’s path to majority.
@williamjordann Bredesen delivered a very Bob Clement-like performance. For those who don’t know him look him up. Time to move on from has-beens. Any chance at winning these races is finding post-ideological candidates with verve. Just look at DCCC.
RT @AndreiCherny: @pkcapitol Russ Feingold
Doug Jones, despite being longtime figure in AL legal circles, felt fresh &amp; authentic a year ago. Beto outperformed Bayh, Bredesen, Espy, Strickland. There’s a lesson in AL &amp; TX. 2/2
MS Sen is 4th “reach” Senate of 2016-18 where Dems went with elder statesman - Bayh, Strickland, Bredesen - only to get routed. 	It’s not about ideology (mod vs lib). It’s about dynamism. Look at those House D candidates who flipped 40+ seats. 	Authentic, dynamic. 1/2

@KristenLFrench @moiskd @HarryHawkings @EvenBetterIn20 SCOTUS nominees have long been given the courtesy of a full Senate floor vote, even if not getting a majority in Judiciary. Bork &amp; Thomas, for example, got that. But for other noms, it would require Flake to affirmatively send noms to full Senate.
Can still vote for 21 noms already pending a full vote, with Pence breaking 50-50 tie, but Flake will effectively block any additional judges getting out of Judiciary Committee. https://t.co/c5ZMReuDKj
@HarryHawkings @EvenBetterIn20 They can only vote for those noms that have already made it out of committee and are awaiting confirmation from full Senate. And McConnell will need to tell Pence to stop traveling anywhere, so he can repeatedly break 50-50 ties. 	No more judicial noms can advance from committee.
@burgessev Also, no more judicial noms will get out of Judiciary Committee, period, until Jan. 3, unless Flake gets a vote.
@burgessev And McConnell needs Pence to stop all travel until Jan. 3.
Flake takes action: He will not vote to confirm any judicial nominee that is already on Senate calendar, and will oppose any judicial nominee in committee, until the Mueller protection bill gets a vote.	In 51-49 Senate, that can make McConnell life a tad more difficult.
@Alex_Roarty @scottdetrow I think most people got lulled into slow pace of the 2015-16 cycle. That was incredibly slow starting cycle. This 2020 cycle is starting just like the 2008 cycle (which started in Dec. '06, with Bayh announcing/then denouncing his bid). HRC got in in Jan. 07.

Eagles defense is not good. The D-backs are so bad covering receivers -- they're worse at tackling them once they catch the pass. 	Fine. But the 2nd half collapses by the Eags offense is what has us on brink of not making playoffs.

@marceelias @Redistrict @WaPoSean And Marc continues to ignore all the other things that I point out about how DCCC is behaving -- abandoning MN8, the downgrading of McGrath's chances in KY6. And my points, not in this story, that Rs who hate Trump now tell me this is a "realignment", not a "wave", election.

@marceelias @WaPoSean Marc, Sean cited nonpartisan Cook report lowering expectations of Dem gains, DCCC bailing on Dem district in Iron Range, Amy McGrath openly saying Kavanaugh protests have backfired against her. Story says Ds are still likely to win House. Are we arguing over “wave” definition?

@rokumar1918 Fair, but you guys really need to give him rest, possibly not using in Game 1 of ALCS, just to get Kimbrel fresh.
@rokumar1918 Would've been tempted to have Sale start 9th, and have Kimbrel waiting in wings. Clearly, Kimbrel was wiped out, physically burnt. Pure luck that Sox won, a bounce of the ball.
Kimbrel is toast. This is that point where he needs to be taken out of the game, but the "rules" will force Sox to leave him in. He's obviously gassed. His pitch count is crazy high, but he will be left in. If Yanks win, at this point, it's luck. https://t.co/Dx0tbGw0U1
Was Sale not available to pitch a 2nd inning? He was in control, and given that you already burn him for Game 1 of ALCS, just keep him in.
Whatever else you think of this moment - whether there’s a lasting bump in R polling or just sugar high - last thing Dems want is MSNBC acting as if the midterms are already baked. https://t.co/KXxurwfBYi

One thing that I wonder, in terms of media coverage, is how much we missed Bush 43's lobbying work. From Collins today on @FaceTheNation :	"He actually called me three times. He knows Brett Kavanaugh very well."
From Borked to Kavanaugh'd, one seat at center of 50-year war.	“When you say ‘Kavanaughed,’ ... it will become a shorthand, at least on our side, for a double standard,” Graham said, “and, at least on our side, for wanting to win too much.”	https://t.co/tf9svV8szx

@sahilkapur @kasie I kinda disagreed with No. 2. I don't think I ever gave odds of ACA repeal north of 45% or so. Even if McCain had voted for skinny repeal, I think at best it was then 50-50 that they could've reconciled a bill that would've a) passed House &amp; b) got McCain vote.

I was prepared for Heyward to hit a walk-off homer to shut me up. Instead, a weak ground out. There's a reason he didn't even start tonight. https://t.co/GKcVoWPDMi
@JulieSax @AlecMacGillis @benpershing Heyward's broken jaw was in 2013. Maybe he never recovered from that, but the Cubs gave him $180m~ contract 2 1/2 years after the broken jaw. He can't hit, period. They overpaid by about $140m by today's standards.
@brianros1 Seemed pretty obvious that Arenado began the hug first. Sorry to make this sounds like the Judiciary Committee debating stuff, but 3B made contact first and then Cub hugged him
I'm obviously a homer for 2008 World Series MVP, but not many pitchers would've endured the ump squeezing @ColeHamels to force the walk, then the Cub defensive mistake. 	Cole ended inning on next pitch.
@AlecMacGillis @benpershing What a comparison! When you look at his year-by-year stats, it's clear everyone screwed up his value. He hit 20 HRs once, never batted .300, hasn't had an .800+ OPS since 2012. 	Michael A. got paid $560k in 2017 for a season that was better than all of Heyward's last 6.
@hillhulse Happy too!
RT @benpershing: @AlecMacGillis @pkcapitol Yeah, what a weird career. His best two seasons were at age 20 and 22. He's now 28—and hasn't to…
@AlecMacGillis It's actually 120 now, as he's 0-2 tonight, leaving a ton of men on base. He stinks. A top 5 worst signing of this decade.
@cwolovick Yes! He also has the right to opt-in, and I can assure that no one -- no one -- is going to pay him $105m for the next 5 years after his disastrously bad last 3 seasons! He literally sucks offensively. He's awful. Phils got more outta Howard offensively than Cubs get from JH.
To put another way: Cubs pay him $20m-$22m in order to provide a glove that's not as good as Michael A. Taylor and a bat that is equivalent.
Cubs signing of Heyward never gets attention it deserves as a catastrophe. Great fielder but impotent at bat. As bad as he is in reg season, he was career .153 BA heading into tonight in playoffs. 	Oh, and Cubs owe him $105m~ over next 5 years!!!!
@AJentleson Save ‘em up, buddy. There will be plenty of time for more nuke option tweets. This isn’t one of them. No leader would go nuclear in order to give him/herself less power. Only way back to 60 on noms is formal rule change with 67+ votes.

@brianros1 What happened to the secondary? I’m amazed at how bad the secondary is. And I’m glad they lost. So no one will mask over that secondary. They were atrocious. They’ve been atrocious all season. All season. The secondary lost that game. Even more than the O-line.

@davekartunen @HolmesJosh @FBI Just to be clear: lying to Congress in any setting is just as much a felony as lying to the FBI. I’ve written a few times about those charged with lying to Congress.
@ahrferrier To be clear: Ron tweeted it to his 75K followers. I just quoted that tweet in a column about the ‘91-‘18 parallels.
@HolmesJosh I think Biden’s point was that these were basic interviews.  Not an investigation. And yes, any FBI interview would be subject to penalty of lying just like it would be for any interview/hearing before Senate.
@HolmesJosh ... so that’s what Biden was responding to. Now, everyone is again overly inflating what FBI role would be for their own gain. Done.
@HolmesJosh ... but Bush 41 folks declared the “investigation” was inconclusive. Which was half true - it was inconclusive but there wasn’t an investigation. Just fact-finding interviews for SJC to use/review ...

@Alex_Roarty This the inherent problem with this NYT clickbait of "live" polling. The poll isn't finished, they've only reached 391 people (at time Alex &amp; I did this exchange). Roughly 25% of poll still has to be conducted. The final numbers could be much, much closer.

@brianros1 Aside from Hoskins, would you guarantee a starting spot next year to anyone who's been a regular starter this year? All suffered massive regression. Sure, you might. take a few back to occupy 6-7-8 lineup slots, but that's it. Worse than 2017.
@thepugdc I've completely reversed course -- I now desperately want the Phils to sign Harper. There's no one on the roster now who has anywhere close to his talent (aside from Hoskins, and in this scenario, Harp bats No. 3 right behind Hoskins).
@thepugdc It's bad, T. Really bad. The Nats accomplished more this season than the Phils, and that's saying something. Soto is now a superstar, gotta bat him 2nd next season, build around him, with or without Harper. Rendon, Turner, Robles, solid foundation. Plus Max.
This Phillies season was - yes, past tense - worse than 2017. Sure, they'll win more games, but they have no more certainty at any position other than where Hoskins plays next year. Epic failure. Every regular player collapsed. Epic fail. Nothing but offseason Qs. https://t.co/YoorTYhb8R

Murkowski and Collins still oppose it. Also, Congress did not pass a budget resolution this year and lacks reconciliation authority. 	Only way ACA gets repealed is if House Rs hold majority and McConnell grows his majority. And they do it next year. 	Otherwise, ACA = law.
“We have our plate full,” McConnell says at weekly presser. Brushing aside Qs about repealing ACA on a party-line vote with Kyl replacing mccain. 	Folks, even with Kyl here, Doug Jones leaves Rs short of votes even for that skinny repeal from ‘17.
@DougHeye Nope. Not how it works in Senate. Frank Lautenberg moaned and groaned when he came back in '03. Specter, after switching sides, went from ranking R on Judiciary, to last on the D side of dais (until Franken arrived).
@DougHeye Yes. Absolutely. Flake is way ahead of Kyl (who is No. 100).

The degree to which Phillies Phans have abandoned this team shows up with all the empty seats in bottom of 9th. We see through their ... averageness.
Tonight, as well as last month, proves a Phillies truism: This is best season in 7 years, yet this atrocious team is no closer to contending. Atrocious.

@brianros1 @KennethBaer Yeah, aside from Nola, those draft picks in Rd 1 of last 4-5 years have been barren.
@steveschale @CaseyCat That video shows a burning truck with functioning wheels and steering column. That's more than the Os have this season.
@KennethBaer Yes, they play hard and have overachieved. but so much "overachieving" is really just Nola having a superb season. We are 19-7 in his starts, and 3 games below .500 when he doesn't start.
@StuPolitics You and @BresPolitico need to watch Phillies games if you want to see horrific baseball. The shine of a fun season is just one. It's nice, we might have a future but holy hell they've been so exposed. They're so unbelievably bad now.
@steveschale I know their status. It’s just embarrassing to see the Phillies play now. They had a nice run and are now totally exposed. So little talent throughout. It’s a really bad team.
The empty seats in Philly show how little we believe in this team. They play hard and have been entertaining.	But the secret is out: they are a bad team.

@benpershing @HotlineJosh The winner of the NL pennant is literally going to be whichever team has the healthiest, rested, most competent bullpen. I don't know a single NL playoff-contending team that has a 'good" bullpen. None.

@SonnyBunch @DistrictDawg Fact check: 1,000% true. 2nd Street, running from SE to NE, was a zone demarcation. Coming from downtown back to the Hill, yes, veteran DC cab riders would stop on Independence Ave, just shy of 2nd St SE, thereby saving 25% or more.

2nd late-night, extra-inning game in past week I've watched. Here's thing about modern MLB -- it's more prone to have mega-long extra-inning games now because no batters know how to hit singles. All batters just swing for homers, even if runners on base.
@evanperez @DougHeye @DCStreetcar Ive passed on this fight to others, Evan, having full confidence we have won. There are no defenders of the street car left. I have to find other civic projects to save DC. Like eradicating Scooter Bros.
Announcers do a disservice when they just show “3rd time through order” stats. Show me particular pitcher’s stats, not league average. 	Also, show me mid-reliever “1st time through” stats in 5th or 6th inning. 	Your 5th best reliever isn’t always better than a starter.

@jonallendc @nathanlgonzales @nielslesniewski I think he can be a great, great player and still might be. But 7 seasons in, he’s not worth a 10-yr deal. Not when you need a 1B, 2B, CF &amp; 1-2 starting pitchers, plus resigning Rendon.
@nielslesniewski @nathanlgonzales To be clear @nathanlgonzales is probably right. Trading him now makes little sense. But a long term deal looks equally foolish. Sure he’s 25 - but this is his 7th season in the league.
@nielslesniewski @nathanlgonzales They lost 5/7 to the Phillies and 1 of those wins was against our exhausted bullpen blowing a 6-2 lead late. Something is fundamentally flawed.

Here's how Q poll asked generic ballot: "If [House election] were being held  today, would you vote for the [D] or [R] in your congressional district? (If undecided) As of today, do  you lean more toward the Democratic candidate or more toward the  Republican candidate?" 3/
