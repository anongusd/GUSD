@roxboro_nc Vaccine effectiveness and the number of people who were vaccinated are also contributing factors.
@roxboro_nc One of the main reasons this flu season has been difficult is the most common flu virus this season is the influenza A(H3N2) virus. We know from past seasons that when H3N2 predominates, we have more severe illness.
@roxboro_nc We are not aware of a widespread practice of doctors sending people back to work or school after 3 days.
@roxboro_nc CDC guidance is that people should stay home until 24 hours after their fever is gone (without the use of a fever-reducing medication). This is because people shed the most virus when they have a fever.

Terplan: There are opportunities for prevention at intersection of reproductive health &amp; substance use, misuse, addiction. #CDCGrandRounds
Terplan: Addiction treatment is an opportunity to improve reproductive health. #CDCGrandRounds
Terplan: We need to bring the silo of reproductive health into public health programming for people who use drugs. #CDCGrandRounds
Terplan: Inequities within reproductive health negatively affect women with substance use disorders. #CDCGrandRounds
Terplan: A solution to fragmentation is integration of mental health, substance use &amp; primary care services. #CDCGrandRounds
Terplan: Providing contemporary healthcare in silos does not meet the needs of individuals and is inefficient &amp; costly. #CDCGrandRounds
Terplan: Health domains include: mental health, physical health, substance abuse, &amp; sexual and reproductive health. #CDCGrandRounds
Terplan: Women seeking healthcare have concerns across multiple health domains. #CDCGrandRounds
Terplan: Women of reproductive age (15-44 years) receive more prescription medications than men. #CDCGrandRounds
Terplan: Women aged 18 &amp; older in 2014 were more likely than men to have serious mental illness in the past year. #CDCGrandRounds
Terplan: While women may have lower addiction rates than men, they are more likely to have serious psychological distress. #CDCGrandRounds
Next #CDCGrandRounds speaker: Dr. Mishka Terplan w/ Virginia Commonwealth University, @VCU.
Frazier: @Samhsagov resources for addressing behavioral health &amp; recovery of women are available at https://t.co/VlsQPnfrLN #CDCGrandRounds
Frazier: Improving outcomes for women w/ opioid dependency requires providing full range of services &amp; recovery supports. #CDCGrandRounds
Frazier: @Samhsagov identifies 4 major areas that support recovery including health, home, purpose &amp; community. #CDCGrandRounds
Frazier: @Samhsagov has developed a model of care for women that includes 5 core components of gender-responsive services. #CDCGrandRounds
Frazier: Women seeking treatment rpt high rates of childhood victimization, sexual abuse &amp; danger from violent partners. #CDCGrandRounds
Frazier: HCPs frequently miss signs of addiction in women/girls, who are more likely to receive long-term prescriptions. #CDCGrandRounds
Frazier: Women more likely than men to live longer, experience pain, &amp; be prescribed addictive medications. #CDCGrandRounds
Frazier: Women over 55 are the largest consumers of prescription drugs. #CDCGrandRounds
Frazier: Women &amp; girls are more likely to have co-occurring disorders &amp; higher rates of depression/anxiety. #CDCGrandRounds
Frazier: Drug use is increasing among adolescent girls &amp; women at higher rates than for men &amp; boys. #CDCGrandRounds
Frazier: Women can have more severe withdrawal and have higher risk of opioid overdose. #CDCGrandRounds
Frazier: Substance use in women progresses more quickly to dependency &amp; to onset of medical problems &amp; disorders. #CDCGrandRounds
Frazier: Recovery support needs like care coordination, transportation, child care &amp; safe housing need to be addressed. #CDCGrandRounds
Frazier: Women w/ opioid use disorders require access to treatment, behavioral interventions, &amp; safe environments. #CDCGrandRounds
Frazier: Women benefit from approaches that account for biological &amp; gender differences associated w/ their substance use. #CDCGrandRounds

Mack: Recent analyses shows 7 out of 10 women who used heroin in past year also misused opioids in past year. #CDCGrandRounds
Mack: In 2015, on average 31 women died every day from an opioid related drug overdose. #CDCGrandRounds
Mack: Since 2007 more women have died annually from a drug overdose than from a motor vehicle crash. #CDCGrandRounds
Mack: Since 1999, there have been over 71,800 prescription opioid related deaths among women. #CDCGrandRounds
Mack: Preliminary reports indicate recent drops in number of opioid prescriptions, but this trend varies by drug. #CDCGrandRounds
Mack: Healthcare providers wrote more than a quarter of a billion opioid prescriptions in 2013. #CDCGrandRounds
Mack: Amount of opioid prescriptions dispensed has quadrupled since 1999 but levels of pain Americans rpt remains unchanged. #CDCGrandRounds
Mack: US is in the midst of an opioid epidemic, driven largely by the overprescribing of opioid medications. #CDCGrandRounds
Mack: 2.8M women met diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder &amp; 28.3M reported binge drinking in past month. #CDCGrandRounds
Mack: In 2015, nearly 21.2M women used an illicit drug or misused a prescription medication in the past year. #CDCGrandRounds

We try to respond to your questions during Q&amp;A session. If there isn‚Äôt enough time, we will follow up w/ you after this #CDCGrandRounds.
Raphael: Policy solutions in SCD should be patient-centered, provider-centered, &amp; health system-oriented. #CDCGrandRounds
Raphael: Healthcare policy strategies are needed to fully realize benefits of basic &amp; clinical science advancements for SCD. #CDCGrandRounds
Raphael: ECHO model which emphasizes specialist support of primary care providers should be more widely used in SCD. #CDCGrandRounds
Raphael: In order to improve the care of ppl w/ #sicklecell disease, a robust policy agenda is needed for SCD research. #CDCGrandRounds
Raphael: Despite advances in care, there are still numerous challenges to improve outcomes of #sicklecell disease. #CDCGrandRounds
Raphael: Advances in care have led to an extended life expectancy for those with #sicklecell disease. #CDCGrandRounds
Raphael: Efforts to make SCD a bigger part of health policy initiatives have been undermined by insufficient data. #CDCGrandRounds
Have a question for our speakers? Send to grandrounds@cdc.gov or tweet using #CDCGrandRounds hashtag &amp; it may be answered.
Raphael: Triple Aim involves 3 components: reduce health care costs, improve population health &amp; enhance patient experience. #CDCGrandRounds
Raphael: Increasingly, health policy makers advocate the Triple Aim as a model for improving population health. #CDCGrandRounds
Final #CDCGrandRounds speaker: Dr. Jean Raphael, w/ Texas Children‚Äôs Hospital. @TexasChildrens
Hassell: Data can be used to develop strategies to prevent &amp; reduce burden of SCD and its complications. #CDCGrandRounds
Hassell: Opportunity of Sickle Cell Data Collection program is to know where adolescents &amp; young adults receive healthcare. #CDCGrandRounds
Hassell: A final key area is access to and utilization of healthcare by adults living w/ #sicklecell disease. #CDCGrandRounds
Hassell: Sickle Cell Data Collection program has potential to clarify course of disease &amp; factors that impact that course. #CDCGrandRounds
Hassell: Common premorbid conditions are often seen in SCD, including congestive heart failure, hypertension, &amp; pneumonia. #CDCGrandRounds
Hassell: Assessing the SCD population as a whole, without distinguishing the type of SCD, may miss important gains. #CDCGrandRounds
Hassell: There are significant differences in expected premature death between types of #sicklecell disease. #CDCGrandRounds
Hassell: Sickle Cell Data Collection program (SCDC) does not yet distinguish b/t different types of #sicklecell disease. #CDCGrandRounds
Hassell: Also important to understand the impact of healthcare access &amp; utilization on course of disease &amp; intervention. #CDCGrandRounds
Hassell: Using population surveillance to understand adult SCD may identify opportunities for prevention &amp; intervention. #CDCGrandRounds
Next #CDCGrandRounds speaker: Dr. Kathryn Hassell w/ University of Colorado Denver. @CUDenver
Whitley: Lack of data decreases our ability to identify health care &amp; policies to best support those w/ #sicklecell disease. #CDCGrandRounds
Whitley: SCDAA developed a database &amp; network where all participants can receive info important to #sicklecell community. #CDCGrandRounds
Whitley: In 2003 the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Act supported increased health services for children &amp; adults w/ SCD.  #CDCGrandRounds
Whitley: For children w/ #sicklecell, great advances have been made to prevent complications before they occur.  #CDCGrandRounds
Whitley: A 1996 study showed bone marrow transplants could cure SCD. As of 2016 over 1K ppl have received transplants. #CDCGrandRounds
Whitley: A 1995 research trial in adults studied whether hydroxyurea therapy could decrease SCD-related complications. #CDCGrandRounds
Whitley: Another research study showed chronic transfusion therapy reduced risk of 1st stroke in children w/ SCD-SS. #CDCGrandRounds
Whitley: In 1992 researchers predicted which children w/ SCD would develop stroke using transcranial Doppler ultrasound. #CDCGrandRounds
Whitley: In 1987 @NIH recommended all states adopt universal screening of newborns for #sicklecell disease. #CDCGrandRounds
Whitley: In 1972 the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act passed &amp; allowed resources to support SCD research &amp; care. #CDCGrandRounds
Whitley: #Sicklecell related morbidity &amp; mortality were still high by late 1960‚Äôs and in 1971 @SCDAAorg was formed.  #CDCGrandRounds
Welcome our next #CDCGrandRounds speaker: Dr. Kim Smith-Whitley w/ Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. @ChildrensPhila
Hulihan: Next steps for SCDC: disseminate findings, add additional states &amp; secure additional sustained support &amp; funding. #CDCGrandRounds
Hulihan: SCDC program will collect, synthesize &amp; disseminate multi-source, population-based data for people with SCD. #CDCGrandRounds
Hulihan: In 2015, we began working on state-based surveillance, the Sickle Cell Data Collection program (SCDC). #CDCGrandRounds
Hulihan: SCD is estimated to affect appx 100K Americans, but there are no national registries so exact number is unknown. #CDCGrandRounds
Hulihan: Newborn screening for #sicklecell disease is required in all 50 states &amp; has improved outcomes for children. #CDCGrandRounds
Hulihan: People w/ most severe form of SCD have a life span that is 2-3 decades shorter than those without #sicklecell. #CDCGrandRounds
Hulihan: Over a lifetime, SCD can harm a person‚Äôs brain, spleen, eyes, lungs, liver, &amp; multiple other organs &amp; systems. #CDCGrandRounds
Hulihan: Attacks of sudden, severe pain, called pain crises are the clinical hallmark of #sicklecell disease. #CDCGrandRounds
Hulihan: Access to public health infrastructures, screening programs, &amp; medical interventions could lower global mortality. #CDCGrandRounds
Hulihan: Globally, there are appx 300K annual births w/ #sicklecell disease &amp; almost 80% occur in sub-Saharan Africa. #CDCGrandRounds
Hulihan: #SickleCellTrait is when 1 sickle gene is present, not 2. Typically no symptoms, but can be passed on to child. #CDCGrandRounds
Hulihan: Hemoglobin SC disease and hemoglobin SŒ≤ thalassemia are other common forms of #sicklecell disease. #CDCGrandRounds
Hulihan: Hemoglobin SS, or #sicklecell anemia, is most common form of #sicklecell disease in US &amp; the most severe form. #CDCGrandRounds
Hulihan: In all forms of SCD, at least 1 of the 2 abnormal hemoglobin genes causes a person‚Äôs body to make hemoglobin S. #CDCGrandRounds
Hulihan: People w/ SCD have abnormal hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S or sickle hemoglobin, in their red blood cells. #CDCGrandRounds
Hulihan: The term #sicklecell disease, or SCD, describes a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. #CDCGrandRounds

We try to respond to your questions during Q&amp;A session. If there isn‚Äôt enough time, we will follow up w/ you after this #CDCGrandRounds.
Besser: To keep everyone healthy we must pursue a path that benefits 	patient care and public health. #CDCGrandRounds
Besser: Direct-from-specimen tests could reduce issues between CIDTs and public health needs. #CDCGrandRounds
Besser: Single cell sequencing may allow us to obtain same info we now get through whole genome sequencing of isolates. #CDCGrandRounds
Besser: Metagenomics may make it possible to find solutions to health problems that are currently difficult to address. #CDCGrandRounds
Besser: Metagenomics sequences all the nucleic acids in a sample and is widely used to characterize microbiomes. #CDCGrandRounds
Besser: Amplicon sequencing involves a DNA amplification step followed by next generation sequencing. #CDCGrandRounds
Besser: The future approaches are amplicon sequencing, shotgun metagenomics, and single-cell sequencing. #CDCGrandRounds
Besser: We are exploring 3 strategies to the development of culture-independent advanced pathogen characterization tests. #CDCGrandRounds
Besser: Direct-from-specimen tests reduce time to actionable results; more outbreaks solved quickly &amp; illnesses prevented #CDCGrandRounds
Besser: Process of detecting outbreaks through pathogen-based surveillance can be lengthy and involves many steps. #CDCGrandRounds
Besser: Direct-from-specimen tests should make it possible to detect disease clusters earlier. #CDCGrandRounds
Besser: Developing these tests assures specimens are available for PH activities even if they are biologically inactivated. #CDCGrandRounds
Besser: Long-range plan includes development of direct-from-specimen tests to characterize pathogens. #CDCGrandRounds
Final #CDCGrandRounds speaker: Dr. John Besser, w/ CDC‚Äôs National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, @CDC_NCEZID.
Spring: We must continue to work w/ labs, manufacturers, &amp; Federal agencies to explore measures to aid surveillance efforts. #CDCGrandRounds
Spring: Laboratory developed tests should be taken into account when implementing solutions for public health needs. #CDCGrandRounds
Spring: If diagnostics companies do not develop tests to meet needs of clinical labs, labs may modify/develop own tests. #CDCGrandRounds
Spring: There are new technologies on the horizon the will help reduce compatibility issues between CIDTs &amp; public health. #CDCGrandRounds
Spring: We need to understand and incorporate public health needs into the product development process. #CDCGrandRounds
Spring: These new tests may hinder ability to preserve viable organisms needed for public health related activities. #CDCGrandRounds
Spring: New multiplexed diagnostic tests offer great benefit to physicians, patients, and laboratories. #CDCGrandRounds
Next #CDCGrandRounds speaker: Brad Spring, BS, w/ BD Life Sciences &amp; representing @AdvaMedDx.
Cronquist: We have focused our response to CIDT on accurate case reporting, isolate recovery &amp; adapting PH actions to cases. #CDCGrandRounds
Cronquist: We are working to establish guidance to prioritize which cases should be investigated &amp; timing of investigation. #CDCGrandRounds
Cronquist: We need to implement new CSTE case definitions to classify and transmit surveillance data correctly. #CDCGrandRounds
Cronquist: With CIDT, the data we are acting on has changed &amp; we need to figure out how to use info we receive. #CDCGrandRounds
Cronquist: Culture results are available faster when isolation is performed at the clinical laboratory. #CDCGrandRounds
Cronquist: Case reporting is only part of surveillance. Need isolates to subtype for cluster detection &amp; monitoring trends. #CDCGrandRounds
Cronquist: We continue to work with disease reporters to improve the quality of the CIDT case reports we receive. #CDCGrandRounds
Cronquist: We have discovered there are many ways in which errors occur in reporting culture-independent results. #CDCGrandRounds
Cronquist: We needed to modify our disease surveillance database to capture new tests &amp; ensure data are properly exported. #CDCGrandRounds
Cronquist: It is important to know types of tests each lab is using, so we can understand surveillance info we receive. #CDCGrandRounds
Cronquist: We monitor the local uptake of CIDT by regularly surveying clinical laboratories. #CDCGrandRounds
Cronquist: CIDT is having an impact on surveillance in CO. Recent data shows that 15 labs are using multiplex PCR testing  #CDCGrandRounds
Welcome our next #CDCGrandRounds speaker: Alicia Cronquist, RN, MPH, w/ Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, @CDPHE.
Braden: As technology advances, we must pursue a path that benefits both patient care and public health surveillance. #CDCGrandRounds
Braden: CDC has strategies to meet the surveillance challenges posed by culture-independent diagnostic testing. #CDCGrandRounds
Braden: Possible drawbacks of CIDT are related to the difficulty interpreting results in some situations. #CDCGrandRounds
Braden: Each year, 48 million people get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized and 3,000 die from foodborne diseases. #CDCGrandRounds
Braden: Genotype info has been used in programs such as PulseNet to connect cases and identify foodborne outbreaks. #CDCGrandRounds
Braden: Culture-independent diagnostic tests alone do not provide isolates nor characterize pathogens. #CDCGrandRounds
Braden: Culture-independent diagnostic tests can provide much faster results for targeted early treatment of infections. #CDCGrandRounds
Braden: FoodNet, a network covering about 15% of US population, monitors CIDT use as part of its surveillance activities. #CDCGrandRounds
Braden: In the last 5 yrs there has been an increase in number &amp; types of culture-independent diagnostic tests (CIDT). #CDCGrandRounds
Braden: Since 2010, we have seen expansion in multiplex PCR panels, which detect one or multiple pathogens simultaneously. #CDCGrandRounds
Braden: Culture-based diagnostic tests have been used for over 150 years, having been invented by Louis Pasteur. #CDCGrandRounds

T2. Spaying/neutering pets helps reduce the number of unwanted animals and rabies risk. #RabiesChat
@srecuenco A major challenge globally is to get these vaccines to the right ppl and animals at the right time. #logistics #RabiesChat
T2. Rabies prevention vaccine costs 1 month‚Äôs salary in many countries so unfortunately may not be an option for many families. #RabiesChat
T2. OIE‚Äôs Vaccine Bank helps contribute to the elimination of dog-related human rabies #OneHealth #RabiesChat https://t.co/KKtawkYD2c
@srecuenco While we're always looking for new ways to prevent rabies, vaccines we have today can prevent rabies in ppl &amp; animals #RabiesChat
T2. It costs $1.50 to vaccinate a dog against rabies in most countries. It costs $100 to vaccinate a person. #RabiesChat
T2. Increasing dog vax worldwide is most important way to protect people. If 7/10 dogs gets vax, rabies in dogs is eliminated. #RabiesChat
T2. What can be done to stop rabies globally? #RabiesChat
T1. Think rabies isn‚Äôt a problem in the US? 40,000 people are treated for rabies exposure per year.  #RabiesChat
T1. The US has access to rabies vaccine so we have few rabies deaths, ~1-3 ppl/year. Unfortunately, not so in other countries. #RabiesChat
#DYK Rabies kills more people each year than any other disease spread by animals #RabiesChat

We try to respond to your questions during Q&amp;A session. If there isn‚Äôt enough time, we will follow up w/ you after this #CDCGrandRounds.
Mason: Expanding tracking &amp; surveillance into longer-term follow-up &amp; monitoring involves a range of challenges. #CDCGrandRounds
Mason EHDI study showed children diagnosed w/ hearing loss before 6 mos. of age had greater expressive vocabulary at age 2. #CDCGrandRounds
Mason: States have used EHDI-DASH, an interactive dashboard, to illustrate their own performance relative to other states. #CDCGrandRou
Mason: EHDI has several initiatives to make data more useable to inform policy &amp; practice. #CDCGrandRounds
Mason: CDC EHDI collaborated w/ states on standards that identify operational, programmatic, &amp; technical criteria programs. #CDCGrandRounds
Mason: Lack of standardization, and differences in data quality and timeliness, can create gaps in EHDI data systems. #CDCGrandRounds
Mason: Challenges to collecting complete state &amp; national data include structural issues that may impede monitoring. #CDCGrandRounds
Mason: CDC annually conducts Hearing Screening &amp; Follow-up Survey in which states voluntarily report aggregated data. #CDCGrandRounds
Mason: Screening rates for hearing loss increased from 52% in 2000 to 98% of all births in 2014.  #CDCGrandRounds
Mason: Following newborns from birth through early intervention requires reliable public health surveillance. #CDCGrandRounds
Mason: EHDI programs began w/ universal newborn screening, but have expanded into long-term follow-up. #CDCGrandRounds
Next #CDCGrandRounds speaker: Craig A. Mason, PhD, with University of Maine, @UMaine.
Braun: Progress has been made in CCHD screening but many questions remain w/ respect to both implementation &amp; surveillance. #CDCGrandRounds
Braun: Collaboration between birth defects surveillance, hospitals, community partners &amp; vital statistics is important. #CDCGrandRounds
Braun: NJ DOH has created parent materials in 6 languages &amp; collaborated w/ CDC to address burden &amp; cost questions. #CDCGrandRounds
Braun: Immediate impact of CCHD screening has improved survival. Long-term outcomes may also be improved w/ early detection. #CDCGrandRounds
Braun: Since the beginning of 2012 through the end of 2014, less than 0.4% of eligible infants were not screened in NJ. #CDCGrandRounds
Braun: The NJ Birth Defects Registry has proven to be a very effective method for CCHD screening surveillance. #CDCGrandRounds
Braun: Crucial component of NJ CCHD screening program was linking newborn screening w/ ongoing birth defects surveillance. #CDCGrandRounds
Braun: New Jersey was the first state in the nation to both legislate &amp; implement CCHD screening statewide. #CDCGrandRounds
Next #CDCGrandRounds speaker: Kim Van Naarden Braun, PhD, w/ CDC‚Äôs National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities.
Sontag: Evaluation of short &amp; long term followup is critical to assure quality screening programs identify at-risk infants #CDCGrandRounds
Sontag: A national data collection system is needed to assess true impact of CCHD screening on outcomes for infants. #CDCGrandRounds
Sontag: CDC provides direct assistance to 45 state Early Hearing Detection and Intervention programs. #CDCGrandRounds
Sontag: The birth defects prevention network supported by CDC can be utilized for surveillance purposes. #CDCGrandRounds
Sontag: Quality newborn screening systems must include mechanisms to collect and evaluate data. #CDCGrandRounds
Sontag: All but 2 states now offer universal screening for CCHD. Wyoming will begin screening in Jan 2017. #CDCGrandRounds
Sontag: Screening for hearing loss began in 1990 w/ 2 states; 13 yrs passed before all states developed EHDI programs. #CDCGrandRounds
Sontag: All states are universally offering screening for hearing loss, but it was a long process to get to this point. #CDCGrandRounds
Welcome our next #CDCGrandRounds speaker: Marci K. Sontag, PhD, w/ University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus, @CUAnschutz.
Shapira: Public health must have similar roles in CCHD screening, but it will take some time and effort to get there. #CDCGrandRounds
Shapira: State and territorial EHDI programs have been instrumental in supporting congenital hearing loss screening. #CDCGrandRounds
Shapira: One challenge for CCHD screening is many birthing facilities do not have onsite access to echocardiography. #CDCGrandRounds
Shapira: Newborns who don‚Äôt pass CCHD screening are referred for echocardiogram, an ultrasound imaging study of the heart. #CDCGrandRounds
Shapira: Estimated newborn population w/ CCHD potentially detectable by newborn screening is about 4 per 10,000. #CDCGrandRounds
Shapira: @AmerAcadPeds screening guidance: 1 mos hearing screening, 3 mos hearing evaluation, 6 mos early intervention. #CDCGrandRounds
Shapira: Congenital hearing loss is the most common condition identified by newborn screening in the US. #CDCGrandRounds
Shapira: Point-of care tests are performed at the birthing facility, typically at 24 to 48 hours after birth. CDCGrandRounds
Point-of-care screening is utilized for 2 conditions: hearing loss &amp; critical congenital heart disease (CCHD). #CDCGrandRounds
Shapira: It is still up to states &amp; territories to enact newborn screening requirements for conditions added to the RUSP. #CDCGrandRounds
Shapira: 34 conditions are included in Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) approved by HHS secretary. #CDCGrandRounds
Shapira: In dried bloodspot screening, blood is obtained from neonates via a heel prick at 24 to 48 hours after birth. #CDCGrandRounds
Shapira: Newborn screening benefits neonates &amp; families from early diagnosis &amp; treatment of the screened conditions. #CDCGrandRounds
Shapira: Newborn screening (NBS) benefits babies by detecting life-threatening diseases early. #CDCGrandRounds

We try to respond to your questions during Q&amp;A session. If there isn‚Äôt enough time, we will follow up w/ you after this #CDCGrandRounds.
Patrick: Improving care for women w/ opioid use disorder &amp; infants w/ NAS should be grounded in public health principles. #CDCGrandRounds
Patrick: Progress is being made at all levels of government &amp; health care system in understanding opioid use disorder &amp; NAS. #CDCGrandRounds
Patrick: A Public Health Approach to NAS includes primary, secondary and tertiary prevention. #CDCGrandRounds
Patrick: Many states struggle with public health versus criminal justice approaches to substance use in pregnancy. #CDCGrandRounds
Patrick: There is significant inter- and intra-hospital variation in treatment and outcomes for NAS. #CDCGrandRounds
Patrick: NAS now accounts for 50% of NICU hospital days in some hospitals. #CDCGrandRounds
Patrick: Coordinated, system-wide approaches are needed to optimize outcomes for this vulnerable population. #CDCGrandRounds
Patrick: Hospitals and states vary greatly in their approaches to women with opioid use disorder &amp; infants with NAS. #CDCGrandRounds
Patrick: Responses to the prescription opioid epidemic have often not explicitly included pregnant women &amp; infants. #CDCGrandRounds
Patrick: Rapid rise of opioid use disorder among pregnant women &amp; rise in infants w/ NAS caught many communities off guard. #CDCGrandRounds
Next #CDCGrandRounds speaker: Stephen W. Patrick, MD, MPH, MS, with Vanderbilt University School of Medicine @vusm.
Yonkers: Detection of substance use in pregnancy should be coupled with assistance in obtaining treatment. #CDCGrandRounds
Yonkers: Both biologic tests and self-report may underestimate the magnitude of the problem. #CDCGrandRounds
Yonkers: We still don‚Äôt know best approach to screening for substance use in pregnancy but comparative research is underway. #CDCGrandRounds
Yonkers: Screening and Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) can lead to decreased use of other substances.  #CDCGrandRounds
Yonkers: Guidelines recommend women who are dependent upon opiates be treated w/ medication assisted therapy &amp; counseling. #CDCGrandRounds
Yonkers: If we decide to adopt screening protocols we will have to decide how screening should be conducted. #CDCGrandRounds
Yonkers: Early screening will lead to higher rates of detection and can identify women who need assistance. #CDCGrandRounds
Yonkers: We have to consider which pregnant women to screen, when they should be screened &amp; what substances to screen for. #CDCGrandRounds
Yonkers: There are questions about screening in which we have either limited or no data to guide our practices. #CDCGrandRounds
Yonkers: Screening can be useful in determining substance use in pregnant women but there are issues to consider. #CDCGrandRounds
Next #CDCGrandRounds speaker: Kimberly A. Yonkers, MD, with Yale University School of Medicine @yalemed.
Broussard: Strategies to improve preconception health can be implemented at provider, patient, &amp; population levels. #CDCGrandRounds
Broussard: CDC‚Äôs Treating for Two aims to improve health of moms &amp; babies through safer medication use in pregnancy. #CDCGrandRounds
Broussard: CDC is making some progress towards reducing opioid use among women of reproductive age &amp; pregnant women. #CDCGrandRounds
Broussard: CDC has a guideline for primary care clinicians on prescribing opioids for chronic pain. #CDCGrandRounds https://t.co/QqX237a9sF
Broussard: CDC is supplying health care providers with resources to improve patient safety. #CDCGrandRounds
Broussard: CDC is strengthening state efforts by helping states target and tailor public health prevention resources. #CDCGrandRounds
Broussard: CDC is working to reverse prescription drug overdose epidemic by improving data quality &amp; tracking trends. #CDCGrandRounds
Broussard: Women b/w ages of 25-54 are most likely to go to ER because of prescription opioid misuse or abuse. #CDCGrandRounds
Broussard: Along w/ prescription use, the misuse and abuse of opioids in the US has increased in recent years among women. #CDCGrandRounds
Broussard: 14%‚Äì22% of women filled an opioid medication prescription during pregnancy from 2008-2012. #CDCGrandRounds
Broussard: CDC reported from 2008- 2012 on avg. abt 1/3 reproductive-aged women filled prescription for opioid medication. #CDCGrandRounds
Welcome our next #CDCGrandRounds speaker: Cheryl Broussard, PhD, w/ CDC‚Äôs Birth Defects Branch @CDC_NCBDDD.
Barfield: A public health approach is needed to prevent opioid abuse, misuse &amp; dependence across lifespan. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: Ideally, prevention of NAS could occur by preventing opioid use prior to conception but there are many challenges. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: From 1998-2011 opioid abuse/dependence among pregnant women at the hospital for delivery increased 127%. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: NAS incidence rates differ by geographic region. In 2012 KY, TN, MS &amp; AL had b/w 15-20 cases per 1000 births. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: In 2012, on average, one infant was born every 25 minutes with NAS in the US. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: NAS is most commonly attributed to exposure to opioids during pregnancy. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: Post-natal effects may include prolonged hospitalization, poor postnatal growth, dehydration, and seizures. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: In utero effects of NAS may include poor fetal growth and preterm birth.  #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: Withdrawal symptoms most commonly occur 48‚Äì72 hours after birth of newborn. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is when newborns experience withdrawal after being exposed to drugs in womb. #CDCGrandRounds

We try to respond to your questions during Q&amp;A session. If there isn‚Äôt enough time, we will follow up w/ you after this #CDCGrandRounds.
Peacock: Everyone can invest in early childhood to improve outcomes. Together we can make a difference! #CDCGrandRounds
McCabe: HCPs can advocate for their patients and serve as a resource to connect children to the support they need. #CDCGrandRounds
McCabe: Communities can promote investing in early childhood to keep low/medium-risk children from becoming high-risk. #CDCGrandRounds
McCabe: Behavioral health should be fully integrated into primary care for innovative ways to promote child mental health. #CDCGrandRounds
McCabe: To promote behavioral health &amp; reduce health disparities, we must promote healthy development of all children. #CDCGrandRounds
McCabe: Quite simply, child mental health should be addressed where children live, play, work &amp; grow. #CDCGrandRounds
McCabe: We need a clear &amp; unifying definition of child mental health 	as being a critical part of healthy development. #CDCGrandRounds
McCabe: Estimated 20% of children in US have a mental health problem &amp; only 20% of those receive mental health services. #CDCGrandRounds
McCabe: Most mental disorders in adults can be traced to an onset during childhood. #CDCGrandRounds
McCabe: Fostering social and emotional health in children is part of healthy child development. #CDCGrandRounds
McCabe: Mental health is a critical component of children‚Äôs learning and general health. #CDCGrandRounds
McCabe: Mental health is a public health issue &amp; is fundamental to overall health and well-being of children. #CDCGrandRounds
Our final #CDCGrandRounds speaker: Dr. Mary Ann McCabe, Associate Clinical Professor of Pediatrics with @GWSMHS.
Peacock: We will continue to expand upon our current public health work in addressing early childhood development. #CDCGrandRounds
Peacock: CDC‚Äôs Essentials for Parenting is free, web based tool to promote positive parenting &amp; parent-child relationships. #CDCGrandRounds
Peacock: CDC has worked w/ partners to develop tools for clinicians &amp; parents to look for physical developmental delays. #CDCGrandRounds
Peacock: ‚ÄúLearn the Signs. Act Early.‚Äù improves early identification of children at risk for developmental disabilities. #CDCGrandRounds
Peacock: CDC has a number of public health activities to improve early detection and referral to treatment. #CDCGrandRounds
Peacock: CDC initiative, Focus for Future, works to make sure children w/ ADHD get right care at right time. #CDCGrandRounds
Peacock: Children w/ disorders were more likely to live in a neighborhood that was in poor condition &amp; lacked amenities. #CDCGrandRounds
Peacock: 15% of US children aged 2-8 yrs old have had a diagnosed mental, behavioral or developmental disorder. #CDCGrandRounds
Peacock: Ensure access to evidence-based treatment for children w/ mental, behavioral or developmental disorders. #CDCGrandRounds
Peacock: Public health model for early childhood includes determining how many children have specific disorders. #CDCGrandRounds
Peacock: Healthy People 2020 goals include increasing access to high quality healthcare for young children #CDCGrandRounds
Next #CDCGrandRounds speaker: Dr. Georgina Peacock, Director of CDC‚Äôs Division of Human Development and Disability at NCBDDD.
Dworkin: Cross-sector collaboration is essential to supporting development of all children through system transformation. #CDCGrandRounds
Dworkin: In 2014-2015 ‚ÄúHelp Me Grow‚Äù connected 2,800 children &amp; families to community-based services in CT. #CDCGrandRounds
Dworkin: Children not eligible for publicly-funded services are connected to community programs in CT.  #CDCGrandRounds
Dworkin: Gap exists btw identifying children in need &amp; connecting to child development &amp; early child education programs. #CDCGrandRounds
Dworkin: Poor housing, with dangerous lead burden, is one of many adverse influences on children‚Äôs healthy development. #CDCGrandRounds
Dworkin: 30-40% of children are progressing on at-risk or vulnerable trajectory, not meeting criteria for early intervention #CDCGrandRounds
Dworkin: Another critical concept in early child development is that of developmental trajectories. #CDCGrandRounds
Dworkin: We must address the critical influence of social &amp; environmental factors, genetics, &amp; individual behavior. #CDCGrandRounds
Dworkin: Health outcomes are influenced by more than quality health care. #CDCGrandRounds
Welcome next #CDCGrandRounds speaker Dr. Paul Dworkin, Professor of Pediatrics w/ University of Connecticut School of Medicine.
Thompson: Cost-effectiveness studies show well-implemented early interventions show a long-term return on investment. #CDCGrandRounds
Thompson: Public health systems can also increase awareness of early physical and mental health issues. #CDCGrandRounds
Thompson: Public health systems can increase emphasis on birth to age 5 for prevention &amp; health promotion. #CDCGrandRounds
@Woman_of_Steele Visit https://t.co/J5VLrzbMUY to access the live webcast.
Thompson: Special health care needs may start at young age but many children don‚Äôt receive services until they enter school. #CDCGrandRounds
Thompson: Families may lack a medical home, especially if they are living in rural areas or face barriers to medical access. #CDCGrandRounds
Thompson: There are challenges young children &amp; families face that make them more vulnerable to health disparities. #CDCGrandRounds
Thompson: Poverty in early childhood is associated with fewer years of completed schooling and poorer health. #CDCGrandRounds
Thompson: Age 3 vocab size is good predictor of child‚Äôs reading scores at grade 3, which in turn can predict HS graduation. #CDCGrandRounds
Thompson: Children in higher socioeconomic families had vocab that was more than 2x size of children in less adv families. #CDCGrandRounds
Thompson: Children's everyday experiences w/ adult caregivers provide a foundation for conceptual achievement. #CDCGrandRounds
Thompson: Example: Developing language &amp; literacy skills have very early roots in social experiences of infants &amp; toddlers. #CDCGrandRounds
Thompson: Practitioners in all fields haven‚Äôt kept pace w/ rapidly expanding knowledge of early learning &amp; its influences. #CDCGrandRounds
Thompson: Cognitive, social, &amp; emotional development along w/ physical health shape young children's capacities to learn. #CDCGrandRounds
Thompson: The report highlights how to makes systems of care function better for young children &amp; their families. #CDCGrandRounds

Question for our speakers? Send to grandrounds@cdc.gov or tweet using #CDCGrandRounds hashtag and it may be answered.
Komaroff: More research is needed. NIH recently announced intention to expand focus on CFS/ME. #CDCGrandRounds
Komaroff: CFS/ME is an important disease, causing suffering to many and billions of dollars in lost productivity. #CDCGrandRounds
Komaroff: @theIOM proposed changing name of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome to systemic exertional intolerance disease (SEID). #CDCGrandRounds
Komaroff: Key elements of #CFS definition: post-exertion malaise, poor sleep, cogn. impairments &amp; orthostatic intolerance. #CDCGrandRounds
Komaroff: The IOM proposed a new case definition for CFS likely to result in less false-neg &amp; false-pos classifications. #CDCGrandRounds
Komaroff: According to IOM, evidence also shows immunological abnormalities in patients with #CFS.  #CDCGrandRounds
Komaroff: Both @theIOM &amp; @NIHprevents  reports noted evidence of underlying neurological abnormalities in patients w/ #CFS. #CDCGrandRounds
Komaroff: @theIOM, @NIHprevents and @AHRQNews recently published reports on CFS definition, biology, diagnosis &amp; treatment. #CDCGrandRounds
Next #CDCGrandRounds speaker: Dr. Anthony L. Komaroff, Professor, Harvard Medical School.
Unger: CDC also holds continuing education outreach and communication calls (PCOCA) with general and advocacy community. #CDCGrandRounds
Unger: MedEd Portal videos &amp; curriculum will be available to medical school faculty to address gap in CFS coverage. #CDCGrandRounds
Unger: CDC &amp; the Assoc. of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) are creating free peer-reviewed patient videos via MedEd Portal. #CDCGrandRounds
Unger: CDC has 2 online continuing medical education courses on CFS for health care professionals. https://t.co/pNG2A6TtCH  #CDCGrandRounds
Unger: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome remains a challenge for clinicians; more evidence-based information is needed. #CFS #CDCGrandRounds
Unger: CDC baseline results show functional status of #CFS patients is severely impaired compared to patients w/o CFS.   #CDCGrandRounds
Unger: CDC study of #CFS patients is underway in 7 clinical sites; many part of the Open Medicine Institute Consortium. #CDCGrandRounds
Unger: CDC has shifted focus to studying CFS patients in clinics to document expert approaches to diagnosis &amp; management. #CDCGrandRounds
Unger: Twin and family studies support the contribution of genetic and environmental factors in #CFS. #CDCGrandRounds
Unger: Compared w/ healthy controls, persons w/ #CFS have higher stress exposure &amp; more likely to have metabolic syndrome. #CDCGrandRounds
Unger: Infections are linked to #CFS because patients often report onset after a flu-like illness that doesn‚Äôt go away.  #CDCGrandRounds
Unger: When CFS occurs before age 25, the ability of patients to complete their education is significantly impaired. #CDCGrandRounds
Unger: The U.S. estimated annual cost of lost productivity due to #CFS is $9-37 billion. #CDCGrandRounds
Unger: The U.S. estimated annual direct medical costs associated w/ #CFS is $9-14 billion; nearly 25% paid out of pocket. #CDCGrandRounds
Unger: Highest prevalence of #CFS is in 40-50 year olds but children and adolescents also affected. #CDCGrandRounds
Unger: All races &amp; ethnic backgrounds are affected by #CFS; higher burdens in minorities &amp; socioeconomically disadvantaged. #CDCGrandRounds
Unger: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is 3 to 4 times more common in women than men. #CDCGrandRounds
Unger: At least 1 million Americans suffer from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome; only about 20% have been diagnosed.  #CDCGrandRounds
Next #CDCGrandRounds speaker: Dr. Elizabeth Unger, CDC Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology.
Lapp: CFS can have severe impact on quality of life but improvement and recovery are possible. #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome can affect children and adults. #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp: Another non-pharmacologic therapy is brief intervals of low level physical activity followed by adequate rest. #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp: Non-pharmacologic therapies are physical and might include Epsom soaks, hot or cold packs, massages and acupuncture. #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp: Pharmacologic therapies (medications) are used to manage sleep disruption, pain and other severe symptoms.  #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp: Behavior modification has been effective in limiting depression and abnormal coping mechanisms.  #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp: CDC has resources and educational materials on chronic fatigue syndrome at https://t.co/pNG2A6TtCH. #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp: Four basics of CFS management include: education, behavior change, medication and non-med based treatments. #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp: Prompt diagnosis of CFS reduces patient anxiety and uncertainty as well as medical costs.  #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp: Many clinicians use SEID in combination with other established instruments to diagnose CFS.  #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp: The IOM criteria for Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease (SEID) provides simple methods for CFS diagnosis. #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp:  Lab testing may rule out other causes of fatigue such as infection, celiac disease, autoimmune &amp; endocrine disorders. #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp: Diagnosis of CFS involves review of medical and psychosocial histories, physical exam and mental health assessment. #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp: People with CFS are more likely to suffer co-illnesses such as fibromyalgia, irritable bowel &amp; chemical sensitivities. #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp: Total recovery from CFS is uncommon and most adults do not return to pre-illness level of function. #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp: Unpredictable onset and severity of relapses makes it difficult for CFS patients to function on a regular basis. #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp: Many CFS relapses occur spontaneously and last for indefinite periods of time. #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp: Over-exertion, sleep deprivation and emotional stress are well-known triggers of CFS. #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp: CFS is triggered by viral or bacterial infection in about 75% of cases; trauma, surgery &amp; high stress also factors. #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp: Key symptoms of CFS include debilitating fatigue, sleep problems, and widespread pain. #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp: Majority of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome cases occur over hours to days following a bacterial- or viral-like illness. #CDCGrandRounds
Lapp: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) has diverse symptoms and mimics many other disorders. #CDCGrandRounds

Hatchett: Models are introduced into policy discussions often function as conduits for communication. #CDCGrandRounds
Hatchett: As data accumulates, the accuracy of the predictions improves. #CDCGrandRounds
Hatchett: As modeling techniques improve, the cone of error for aggregate models shrinks. #CDCGrandRounds
Hatchett: No ‚Äúbest model‚Äù exists but combining multiple models into a single risk forecast may be preferable. #CDCGrandRounds
Hatchett: Many infectious disease modelers use ideas &amp; methods from the science of weather prediction. #CDCGrandRounds
Hatchett: Models facilitate analysis, help explore what-ifs, and establish areas of risk. #CDCGrandRounds
Hatchett: Models shouldn‚Äôt be misused; they should be limited to domains the model was set up to address. #CDCGrandRounds
Hatchett: Models aid decision making by: explaining phenomena, providing foresight &amp; making predictions. #CDCGrandRounds

Howse: Public-private partnerships are effective way to address preterm prevention. #CDCGrandRounds
Next #CDCGrandRounds speaker: Jennifer Howse, PhD, President of the March of Dimes Foundation
Henderson: @MarchofDimes is also leading the development of National Network w/ CDC to improve maternal &amp; infant health. #CDCGrandRounds
Henderson: CDC‚Äôs efforts will increase capacity in states to improve maternal &amp; infant health. #CDCGrandRounds
Henderson: CDC is also supporting the development of a National Network of State Perinatal Quality Collaboratives. #CDCGrandRounds
Henderson: CDC‚Äôs Div. of Reproductive Health provides resources to build and sustain PQCs at https://t.co/EKKz44KfWr #CDCGrandRounds
Henderson: For 5 yrs, the avg. rate of early elect. deliveries has decreased. For the 2nd yr, we reached target of &lt; 5%. #CDCGrandRounds
Henderson: CDC-funded PQC‚Äôs have successfully reduced early elective deliveries (scheduled deliveries w/o a medical reason) #CDCGrandRounds
Henderson: CDC is supporting PQCs to help expand efforts throughout states, develop resources &amp; form a national network.  #CDCGrandRounds
Henderson: PQC‚Äôs work to advance evidence-based OB and neonatal practices through continuous quality improvement. #CDCGrandRounds
Henderson: Perinatal quality collaboratives (PQCs) are networks of perinatal care providers &amp; public health professionals. #CDCGrandRounds
Next #CDCGrandRounds speaker: Zsakeba Henderson, MD w/ CDC‚Äôs National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention.
James: Broadly addressing social determinants can improve health outcomes across-the-board, including infant mortality. #CDCGrandRounds
James: Systemic factors that drive health inequities: education, labor &amp; housing, govt. regulation and health care systems. #CDCGrandRounds
James: HRSA‚Äôs Healthy Start program, has worked for ~25 years to improve infant mortality in under-resourced locations. #CDCGrandRounds
James: CenteringPregnancy, a prenatal care program, has reduced the preterm birth rate for African American participants. #CDCGrandRounds
James: @MarchofDimes Storks Nest was created to address the needs of the African-American community. #CDCGrandRounds
James: Highlighting the racial &amp; ethnic differences shows health officials where to focus resources. #CDCGrandRounds
James:  If the slower pace of improving the black IMR does not improve, we won‚Äôt accomplish goal for blacks by 2020. #CDCGrandRounds
James: For Healthy People 2020, the IMR goal of 6 for all races was reached by whites in ‚Äò97, 23 years before target date. #CDCGrandRounds
James: For Healthy People 2000, we reached IMR goal of 7 for whites in '92. We reached goal of 11 for blacks in 2013. #CDCGrandRounds
James: The rate of IMR improvement has been faster for whites than for blacks, so the disparity btwn the two has increased. #CDCGrandRounds
James: Higher IMRs are assoc. w/ many risk factors such as: being uninsured or on Medicaid, smoking, or being overweight. #CDCGrandRounds
James: IMR among Blacks is decreasing but a gap persists. In 2013, black infants died at 2.2x the rate of white infants. #CDCGrandRounds
James: Since 1980, the U.S. infant mortality rate (IMR) has declined 52%, but decline hasn‚Äôt been equal for everyone. #CDCGrandRounds
Next #CDCGrandRounds speaker: Dr. Arthur James w/ the Ohio State University, Wexner Medical Center.
Barfield: We must improve quality of care, identify symptoms and outcomes of late preterm birth &amp; strengthen partnerships. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: We must improve data for surveillance of preterm birth, research the causes &amp; use best practices to prevent it. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: To solve this problem, we must focus on four areas: surveillance, research, care and partnerships. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: Race, family history &amp; a history of prior preterm birth are some of the strongest predictors of preterm birth. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: Preterm birth is a complex disorder‚Äîthe result of social, behavioral, clinical &amp; biol. risk factors. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: To lower overall U.S. infant mortality rates, we must address racial &amp; ethnic disparities in preterm birth. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: The high rate of preterm birth among black mothers is the primary driver of U.S. infant mortality. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: Disparities in preterm birth drive disparities in infant mortality, thereby elevating the U.S. infant mortality rate.
Barfield: Disparities are also seen for Native Americans and subgroups of Hispanics when compared to non-Hispanic whites. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: Rates of congenital malformations, SIDS, &amp; unintentional injuries occur at higher rates for non-Hispanic blacks. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: Preterm-related causes of death for non-Hispanic blacks are more than 3x higher than that of non-Hispanic whites #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: Every year, nearly 350,000 American babies are born too soon. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: 9.6% of all live births are preterm, yet 66% of infant deaths in the U.S. are preterm babies. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: The contribution of preterm birth to U.S. infant mortality is incredibly disproportionate.  #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: There is a massive spike in mortality for the earliest preterm babies, those at 32 weeks gestation.  #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: Mortality rates are consistently higher among preterm babies and our tiniest babies bear the biggest burden. #CDCGrandRounds
Around 2000, returns from medical advances such as ventilators &amp; surfactant decreased. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: In 1990, FDA approved pulmonary surfactant which decreased U.S. infant mortality by almost 35 percent. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: The high rate of preterm birth is the primary factor driving the high U.S. infant mortality rate.  #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: The U.S. has highest IMR among developed countries, despite spending more on health care per capita. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield:  U.S. infant mortality rate (IMR) is 2-3 times higher than that of other developed countries. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: Preterm birth is a significant contributor to U.S. health and socioeconomic disparities. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: In 2005, @theIOM estimated the yearly burden associated with U.S. preterm birth is at least $26.2 billion. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: Longer-term effects of preterm birth include motor, cognitive, behavioral and developmental problems. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: Premature infants are also at risk for immunologic, central nervous system, hearing and vision problems. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: Preterm infants are at increased risk of death as well as respiratory, cardio, gastro, immune &amp; vision problems. #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: Key concepts: preterm pregnancies last less than 37 weeks and can be classified as early or late.  #CDCGrandRounds
Barfield: Key concepts: Pregnancies that last over 37 wks are called term pregnancies. Most term pregnancies last ~40 wks. #CDCGrandRounds

Gilboa: Based on the modifiable risk factors that have been recognized, we know that we can improve prevention #CDCGrandRounds
Gilboa: Birth defect causes are likely to be multi-factorial w/ an interaction between genetic &amp; environmental risk factors. #CDCGrandRounds
Gilboa: Birth defects are common, costly, and critical. The majority still do not have an identifiable cause. #CDCGrandRounds
Gilboa: Models shows appx 430 orofacial clefts are preventable each yr w/ cessation of smoking just before pregnancy. #CDCGrandRounds
Gilboa: Smoking during pregnancy is one of few known risk factors for orofacial clefts w/ a potential for prevention.   #CDCGrandRounds
Gilboa: Models show congenital heart defects could be averted if women w/ pregestational diabetes had blood sugar under ctrl #CDCGrandRounds
Gilboa: Type 1 &amp; type 2 diabetes has increased in US. Among women of reproductive age estimates vary between 1.9 and 4.0%. #CDCGrandRounds
Gilboa: Models shows elimination of prepregnancy obesity would have great impact on reducing congenital heart defects. #CDCGrandRounds
Gilboa: Modeling of other risk factors focused on maternal prepregnancy obesity, pregestational diabetes, &amp; smoking. #CDCGrandRounds
Gilboa: We have used modeling of other risk factors for birth defects to see where we might have further impact. #CDCGrandRounds
Gilboa: Data through 2011 estimated folic acid fortification in US prevents neural tube defects in appx 1,300 births per yr #CDCGrandRounds
Gilboa: Immediately following mandatory fortification, the birth prevalence of neural tube defects declined. #CDCGrandRounds
Gilboa: Ready-to-eat cereals were also allowed to be fortified up to 400 micrograms per serving in 1998. #CDCGrandRounds
Gilboa: In 1998, enriched cereal grain products were required to be fortified at 140 micrograms per 100 grams.. #CDCGrandRounds
Gilboa: In 1992 USPHS recommended that women of childbearing potential consume 400 micrograms of folic acid daily. #CDCGrandRounds
Gilboa: Folic acid intake during early pregnancy can protect against neural tube defects. #CDCGrandRounds
Final #CDCGrandRounds speaker Dr. Suzanne Gilboa with CDC‚Äôs National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities.
Mitchell: VAMPSS is proven to work in monitoring safety of emergency countermeasures in pregnant women. #CDCGrandRounds
Mitchell: Pregnant women may be at high risk for disease complications which endanger their pregnancies. #CDCGrandRounds
Mitchell: VAMPSS is a unique system designed to assess the risks &amp; safety of vaccines &amp; medications used in pregnancy. #CDCGrandRounds
Mitchell: Vaccination in pregnancy is now recommended to prevent other illnesses such as pertussis in the offspring. #CDCGrandRounds
Mitchell: Proportion of women receiving any Flu vaccine during pregnancy has increased from 18% in 2005 to 54% in 2013. #CDCGrandRounds
Mitchell: We need to focus on medications and vaccines for which trends document increasing use in pregnant women. #CDCGrandRounds
Mitchell: Medication use has increased in past 4 decades w/ women taking 4+ at any time or in 1st trimester of pregnancy. #CDCGrandRounds
Mitchell: Today I‚Äôm speaking on behalf of the Vaccines and Medications in Pregnancy Surveillance System, or VAMPSS. #CDCGrandRounds

Feldkamp: We must systematically monitor all major birth defects occurring in the US to understand their frequency. #CDCGrandRounds
Feldkamp Fortifying cereal grains w/ folic acid increases folate levels of women reducing risk of neural tube birth defects #CDCGrandRounds
Feldkamp: For every 1,000 babies born in US in 2011, 7 died during their 1st yr of life. 1 in 5 are due to a birth defect. #CDCGrandRounds
Feldkamp: By 5 yrs of age, 1 in 20 children will be diagnosed w/ birth defect. Appx 1/4 are congenital heart defects. #CDCGrandRounds
Feldkamp: Major birth defects are common occurring #1in33. 3% of children are born w/ birth defects  per year in US. #CDCGrandRounds.
