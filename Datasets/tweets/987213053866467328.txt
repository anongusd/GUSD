Congratulations @MBuhari . Nigerians have once more expressed confidence in your leadership through the ballot, don't disappoint them.
I see desperate political class in my country, setting the ground for the masses massacre and violence of inordinate proportion. https://t.co/3KnQ9xHiwf
@OfficialPDPNig @OfficialAPCNg People are seeing your party as a desperate party with ulterior motive. Stop these nonsensical comments aimed at over heating the polity.
@OfficialPDPNig @OfficialAPCNg If you have your facts, go to court
@realDonaldTrump Mr President you talk too much

@APCNigeria @MBuhari I support this directive 100%
@obyezeks @MBuhari What do Nigerians really want? @obyezeks, had he kept quiet over such an issue, you would go to the street and say his party is supporting rigging.
@UcheSecondus I pity our polity, with such statements from your like.
@UcheSecondus Are you just realizing that elections are civil? When Jonathan deployed battalions of soldiers for Ekiti elections, what was your take on it? As a leader, you ought to be a good student of history.

Elections should not be shifted for flimsy reason @MBuhari. Let this election be free and fair
@NigeriainfoFM No at all. So far as one is not caught at the wrong side of the law, he or she should not be stopped from moving about

Please @MBuhari and @atiku spare us the experience of Venezuela and Côte de voir. Accept the outcome and let's live in peace.

A true party in a sane Democratic clime should seek to resolve crises in his party, not to declare party members as inconsequential. This is the greatest undoing of Oshimole.
Oshimole's statement is a blatant show of radical rascality which portrays lack of leadership and coordination.
