Events around the world and even in the US today only confirm the dark thinking of Hitler in his speech inscribed on the walls of the @HolocaustMuseum: 'Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the #Armenians?'
By holding Turkey accountable for the #genocide committed by #Ottoman Turks in 1915 - the first Genocide of the 20th Century - then #Erdogan's like-minded genocidal attacks today would be checked and stopped.
We are watching history repeat itself as minorities are facing genocidal persecution, and in some cases carried out by #Turkey. We must act now before Turkey attempts to commit another #genocide in the region, this time against the Kurdish population in #Syria.
...example is the landmark case in MA to continue teaching the #ArmenianGenocide &amp; other crimes against humanity in public schools across the state, for which the Assembly filed an amicus brief &amp; w/support of teachers, students, &amp; survivors, defeated Turkish efforts to remove it.
The US has officially recognized the #ArmenianGenocide since the time of the 1948 Genocide Convention. The subject is covered in training for US FSOs, exhibited in the @HolocaustMuseum, confirmed by the US Court of Appeals for DC, &amp; taught in schools &amp; universities. A perfect...
...have been afraid to reaffirm the US record so clearly. It is a dysfunctional situation that needs to be corrected, and once again we will turn to Congress to reflect the will of the American people and be faithful to the principles that make this country great.
They are not only embarrassing but also dangerous in a time where we see the risk of genocide in the same region and around the world increasing, as well as an increase in hate crimes. Since President Ronald Reagan clearly used the term #ArmenianGenocide, successive presidents...
