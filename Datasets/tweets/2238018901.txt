@McAllisterDen Great. 	So the Western Civilization so called leaders decides God is not real.	Shouldn't "we the people" vote on something like that?	When are "we the people" going to take action before it get carried away?
@MollyJongFast That was a "non-burger" moment.	If he ran he would be at 1% so he decided to save his embarrassment.	Bty, i do not see any objective evidence that he is effective yet.	He's no @realDonaldTrump 	We'll give him a year and see where he stands.

Correction: Prediction: Roger Stone will prove him self innocent on all counts and in the process file a massive law suit for defamation of character.	This will lead to Trumps firing of Mueller and end the witch hunt

I think we need an Independent Internal Investigation of the FBI.	Something seems awry.

Really? 	This is not excessive?	I guarantee you if this was a Democrat this would be done in a much more civil way.	The optics of this arrest proves to me that the FBI is working for the Democrat Party. https://t.co/DOTd4iwmPF

@rolandscahill It would be the job of a person that did more than:	1: Ran a 10 Billion dollar company	2: Ran against 16 seasoned candidates and became President.	3: Has done more in less than two years than any President in History.	Find that person and he/she could correct @realDonaldTrump
@JTrutheau @realDonaldTrump Reports say your a moron.	This is being done because the Truth needs to be told.
@Esteban15120999 @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi Shyster Schumer and Narcotic Nancy are literally the "Swamp"	These two oxygen thieves have been in office for over two decades.	I hold them responsible for the Country's problems that Trump is trying to fix.	Sad but True

@liverational22 1: I'm a College Grad	2: My news is derived solely from facts (As i demonstrated earlier)	3: Trumps approval rating of 40% because 60% of the people are Leftist.	BTW, a guy told me that even if you show a Leftist actual data they still will dismiss it.	(Bias 4 no reason)

@liverational22 The "pig for a president" you immaturely refer to is most likely the greatest world leader this planet will see in modern history.

So I heard there’s like 40 Democrats that are going to run in 2020 against Trump.	Can anybody say “Publicity whores”?
It's time to fire Mueller. Period.	Keeping him on payroll is abiding to the swamp.	I am disappointed with @realDonaldTrump that he has not fired this welfare tax thief. I want my money back.
@jsquizzle23 @HughJasol2 @ChuckCallesto Exactly. I want a job like Mueller where i play with myself for two years and spend 30 million dollars and look important.	That's basically all he did. Peel the onion to the core and you will see.	It's a nothing burger.
@HughJasol2 @ChuckCallesto In other words we don't buy the Liberal hype. We are too intelligent.	I know that makes you druggys pissed off but that's who we be.
@ManlyOx @realDonaldTrump What planet are you from? If you literally say the opposite of what you just said that would be the factual truth.	1: It's truth over tribe.

@barbeckst Ya right, that's reality. Your normal. https://t.co/my2C7iyydr
@barbeckst @realDonaldTrump Your an idiot, no , make it liberal idiot and basically no one likes you.	Your lonely and basically a bot.	Do yourself and all of us a favor and get a job and or a lover and if that fails perhaps a cat. Not a dog, a dog would run away.	Go fuck yourself you Anti-American Activist https://t.co/9GX54IsuUP
@patten_life Well you are a moron for having a "Q" sticker but he did get way too reactive. 	The moral of the story is: If you are going to broadcast stupidity sometimes you get unfavorable reactions.	Commonsense

I read your article and it's rehashing an ugly tragic memory for no reason but to create more pain. 90% of the names are deceased and the rest have been banished from their parish 50 years ago. Why bring this up again? Sensationalism? Sad https://t.co/XJdAJhFSJA
@barbeckst Rather than think of the Government as your mama's tit i think it's better that you become independent and self sustaining.	There is no entity or market that will guarantee you financial stability except for hard work and smart investments. Buy land. Start a business.	Don't whine

@Education4Libs @thedrmouse You offend me cause you don't understand Christ..	And, quit throwing Jesus at people. You lose potential members.

@HughJasol2 You see how you are? He didn't ask them to hack. He stated that if they had any e-mails he would be very happy if they shared them. Perfectly understandable when your running for office. Words matter.

@godFreeWorld @Just_QuestionIT @godless_mom Wrong. I questioned it consistently. I prayed and regained my Faith on numerous occasions. You keep talking about 'knowingly".	Here's a question: What created the "Big Bang"?
@Just_QuestionIT @godFreeWorld @godless_mom What created the 'Big Bang"?
"Notre Dame"	Notre Dame does not belong in the top 4.	Alabama would of been up 28 nothing right now.	This is why we need at least a 16 team playoff system.	Period.

@godFreeWorld @Just_QuestionIT @godless_mom No, your confusing me with re-born Christians.	Catholics do not take the Bible literally but as a book that teaches lessons.	And the Pope is not infallible https://t.co/EY7c4edUrY
@godFreeWorld 1) Your parents are morons	2) he claim seems baseless only because our science can not put it in a nice box.	3) It's not emotion. It's called Faith. Some thing again science can not explain and never will	Bottom Line: If you use science to find God you are using the wrong tool

Well, the final outcome of the Atheist discussion is apparently they are better people than the rest of us and somehow they are their own gods.	Must be nice to be them. https://t.co/ZhN8v9eVXJ
@HughJasol2 @Just_QuestionIT @godless_mom Wow, didn't see that coming. It must feel good though that you guys are so confident that you don't need a higher power. Imagine the Ego you guys must have. You must be millionaires with no problems or fear or heartache or tragedy......	I wish i was like you guys. but i'm not

@TheophilusPrime @YTurtle247 @godless_mom First of all it's God. One God. Catholic Church God.	Second, God adds meaning to your life due to the fact that you live forever. There is so much more but you would need to go to Mass and actually participate and pray https://t.co/XgQHtsxsuv

@ThyLordJesus @godless_mom @CogitaTuti I agree. Bring it on.	I believe Atheism is de-evolution since there was no belief in God before 570 BC. So, believers may be the renaissance period of the modern day world. Make sense? https://t.co/t0VstTqraP

@TDecentralized @Jim1810 @TakeThatStraw Our brain capacity can not understand God.	You try and try to put God in a scientific formula but it won't happen.	If you need to feel warm and fuzzy not believing in something that you can not prove then good luck with that. But it still exist
@nikideemo That's cause your rich and being taken care of.	Get in a desperate survival state and you will be like an animal.	So stop that levitating above us crap.  	Geez, are all Canadians dumb ass liberals?

@godless_mom Oh i'm sorry. I was not aware of the physical "boundaries" when texting on twitter. Is there a protocol I am unaware of that I need to be trained?	Btw, you don't have an NFL team hence you do not exist. https://t.co/ZhW8v5uoM1
@godless_mom @CogitaTuti Knotted up?	So i can't speak my mind?	In this Country (USA) we have what is called the first amendment. 	(Something I believe Atheist would dismantle if they ever ruled)	So, when someone like me expresses my opinion or view in my way it's doesn't mean i'm angry or knotted up.
@PoisonedMalibu @Just_QuestionIT @godless_mom Says the Atheist which is the foundation for communism. (Karl Marks)	Let me tell you something about Communism. It's a pipe dream.	It's a compromised slavery agreement.	It never will work. It will open the door to dictatorship.
@YTurtle247 @godless_mom No i don't see that either.	How bout maybe being real and not PC?
@2019truth Yes why not?	 I would not only steal. I would pillage and take hold of power and reign over people. I would kill the weak because it wouldn't be good for the species.	Basically I would be like a Lion in Africa, Right?	Why not? After all we are just mammals right?
@StevieSteve666 @barbeckst @TheodoWolf @godless_mom lol, that doesn't prove it.	All that shows is the reaction.	What spurs love? Why do we Love? When do we love? etc etc	I love when science tries to put everything in a bottle.
@2019truth I'm not trolling. I'm just expressing my first amendment.	I am sorry if it doesn't coincide with everyone.
@pickledopinion @MPaulkovich Well don't stress.	Expand your mind.
@solduga @nikideemo No, the reason why the news is getting worse is in direct correlation with the absence of God and family values,
@YTurtle247 @godless_mom Wow, you can actually disprove God with facts?	Are you levitating above us all. You must be a god.	So you have come to the conclusion that your life now is meaning less and your existence is that of nothingness.	How is that good again?
@pickledopinion @godless_mom Never met him. Don't take the Bible literally.	Look, Catholics keep it real. We love everybody and pray for them. 	But don't get us mixed up with these re-born bible quoting Christian people.	To us Catholics, they really don't get it. They are missing the Point
@godless_mom @Nick___Collins ah jeez..... now your boring me.	Go back to enjoying the Planet Earth or whatever you guys do....lol

@CogitaTuti @godless_mom Yes
@ManlyOx @Just_QuestionIT @godless_mom That's old and naive dude	Catholics do not take the Bible literally.	It's a book of teachings and inspirations.
@LegendaryAsshol @godless_mom So..... before religion all was good?
@YTurtle247 @godless_mom No attitude no insults.	Just straight up facts and to the point.	I like to stream line.	And don't mix me up with these re-born Christians i was born and baptized a Roman Catholic and did 12 years of Catholic School.	Almost became a Priest but i discovered girls and that was that
@godless_mom @YTurtle247 You keep calling me angry and all the while i'm giggling as text each post. 	You need to have a little more self confidence honey bunny.	Don't be so sensitive.
@godless_mom @CogitaTuti gods?	Ya, i think that's what the Roman pagans did.	Go Catholic. It's the real one.
@Typhonicstat @CubeSteve @godless_mom Would moron suffice ya sensitive creature?	lol	Another thing about atheist is they are so touchy and easy to freak out.	Wonder why?
@Just_QuestionIT No, I refuse to tell my child that he was a mistake or accident or a freak occurrence and his life has no meaning or does not matter. 	He is nothing more than another mammal living in a finite time span. 	Once he dies he never existed.
@barbeckst @TheodoWolf @godless_mom For crying out loud dude, Get a job.	Look it's simple. We can't prove Love. Does that mean it doesn't exist?	And did it ever occur to you that the human species has not evolved enough to effectively communicate the existence of God. 	Hence Faith 	It's that simple
@nikideemo Not strange it's reality.	How do you think they lived before the belief in God?	Do you think it was Nirvana?	It was kill or be killed. Like Animals.
@YTurtle247 I like to think and tell my children that they are better than a pack of wild dogs ya fricken moron. 	Spin all you want with your Disneyland tripe but let me know when you back in the real world.
@Just_QuestionIT Communism: a political theory derived from Karl Marx, advocating class war and leading to a society in which all property is publicly owned and each person works and is paid according to their abilities and needs.	No God believers allowed or you will be put to death.
@Just_QuestionIT Just because our technology and brain are not evolved enough to comprehend the existence of God does not mean God does not exist.	Remember we thought the world was flat?
@The_Vagitarian @godless_mom Oh, so i shouldn't care about my fellow man.	So we should care about people with cancer  or disease.	You see, this is the question an Atheist would ask.	"Why should you care"	Atheist 101
@Halokinq72 @godless_mom Who's Odin?
@LegendaryAsshol @godless_mom Gee, that seems a little one sided.	I guess you could say the same about "love"
@godless_mom @NoahPaulLeGies Because i have a young son.	ok?
@barbeckst @TheodoWolf @godless_mom It's only been happening for 2000 years.	Wow and you are saying that the human race has been doing it wrong all this time? You should get a Nobel Peace Prize. Wow. he EGO you have.
@snarrky Belief in God is not a science project.	That's the mistake everyone keeps making
@ManlyOx @Just_QuestionIT @godless_mom Catholic
@Jim1810 @TakeThatStraw Ya you do. You just want to be different and have people think your "cool"
@TakeThatStraw No, they are just being foolish attention grabbers.	Deep inside they know when they are alone.
@barbeckst @TheodoWolf @godless_mom I hope your right.	That made me feel better.
@Just_QuestionIT That is so one sided and over simplified that it's not worth discussing.	This is your feeble attempt to make your self feel better about turning your back on the Almighty.
@Jim1810 @TakeThatStraw I don't think there are any real Atheist.	It's just people that are confused or trying to rebel for attention.	Sad

Awhile back i had a marine buddy that was a self proclaimed atheist. I ask him if he didn't believe why doesn't he steal and take what ever he wants?	He said "I don't want to go to jail". That's when it dawned on me:	Atheist are ruled by Man	Believers are ruled by God https://t.co/Yjb8rEGadC

@godless_mom Ya, Godless people tend to give up easily. 	If you have no fight or passion, what do you have?
@RobinCrjr @godless_mom Send your kids to a Catholic School and you will give them the ultimate gift for life and quite possibly save their soul.
@dmarkflyover @godless_mom All religious groups have their problems.	But the overall value and intent is the goal.	No religious group can control all the members of their flock all the time.

@solduga @godless_mom The one over 2 syllables
@AllenHa19434025 @godless_mom How would you know.	I simply stated my opinion and you do not know my doctrine
@CubeSteve @godless_mom When you don't introduce your child to God, your are robbing that child of a great gift and great knowledge. 	With out God how can there be hope?	How can there be pure Love?	How can there be enlightenment?	This is what you deny them
@TheodoWolf @godless_mom The creator of "All" is an invisible friend?	How about teaching kids that there is a higher power that loves you?	How about teaching kids that they are special gifts to the world?	How about teaching kids that there is a spiritual world that will relieve us of all our "wanting"?
@godless_mom You see how "Atheist" work?	A: She just called me a moron for believing in the bible 	B: When she said enjoy your holiday she meant GFY	Lady, your quick replies and defensive attitude solidified my suspicions.	I don't hate you. I have doubt in humanity when i see this
@solduga @godless_mom Don't know the word. Dumb it down Eisenstein
@godless_mom Well if you hover over you dumb ass twitter face it reads "Raising kids as an atheist. "	So, wtf do you want people to think? The bottom line is your a fool. And this immature little girl excuse of "religious ppl" is just silly and you know it.	Grow up and see the light.
I don't understand people that claim to be "Atheist"	What benefit is there not to believe in a higher power?	Do they have such a huge ego that they think they are gods?	Are they immature and lonely and need attention?	Is this the new "clique" like they do in Highs school? https://t.co/GJJPd5vqRS
@godless_mom You seem to be infatuated with the fact that you are an atheist to the point I suspect that there maybe a little feeling of guilt?	But to teach your kids that there is no God in my opinion borders on Child abuse.	Nuff Said, You disgust me.

Wife Gets Her Revenge After Husband Tried To Be Funny About Her Weight https://t.co/CsnXhpFSsA via @Reshareworthy
@si_ncaafb @WillRagatz Could be?	lol
She replied with a snicker. 'It's not talcum powder; it's 'Miracle Grow'!	4/3
The next morning the husband took a pair of his underwear out of his drawer.. 'What the heck is this?' he said to himself as a little 'dust' cloud appeared when he shook them out.	'Cathy', he hollered into the bathroom, 'Why did you put talcum powder in my underwear?'	3/3
His wife was not amused, and decided that she simply couldn't let such a comment go unrewarded. 	2/3
One evening a husband, thinking he was being funny, said to his wife, 'Perhaps we should start washing your clothes in 'Slim Fast'. Maybe it would take a few inches off of your butt!'	1/3

@sctbrdy Because it does, Especially in these times when God believers are being attacked and mocked constantly. We are at war. The difficulty is the God believers still love all.

@dmills3710 @POTUS Well I'm Catholic and I guess I am just not comfortable with these Christians spewing out their superiority over the rest of us. (It reminds me of ISIS).	Bottom line is this, if you believe in God good. 	But don't turn people, unless you are actually trying to turn off people.
@GregBishopSI @si_ncaafb When football players stat representing the Country's moral code, we are screwed. https://t.co/njEeUQSxdM
@CNBC He would of fired his board https://t.co/1aZO73sKfx
@ConanOBrien Disagree, "Conan" is the dirtiest sounding fruit. https://t.co/4F4EVqT5le
@dmills3710 @POTUS I don't think God recognizes Countries.	So in other words, I don't think God will ask you at the pearly gates, 	"Hey honey, what country you from?" https://t.co/jKEpZXjdIs
@dmills3710 @POTUS Oh please stop with this Lord bullshit.	Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and give to God what is God's. 	Government is Caesar's world. Know the difference. https://t.co/MpLG0DBu5C
Once again the Referee call of roughing the passer killed the hopes of Green Bay covering the spread.	If this happens consistently like it appears, Football will suffer in ratings.	Sports betters do not want a REF determining a game's outcome.	Not good https://t.co/LXbG5F3zRF

@TheGreatFeather @MareForAmerica Great tweet
@uscpsycho Or, don't go to the games and send a clear message that USC Alumni will not tolerate anything short of excellence. It's all or bust. Anyone can be a loser. Nothing to be proud about. Get rid of the coach. Shake things up. https://t.co/rSEhyUeQHj
@UCFSportsInfo @UCFSports Hottest chicks ever!
@nosoupforgeorge @realDonaldTrump Let's get real. Real football fans wager on out comes. We are only interested on the out come. We don't care if they are wearing tutus, as long as they cover the spread.	It's fricken football guys. Nothing else. https://t.co/wqrlMZ5CHX

"Targeting penalty" started in 2010. 	(It's out of control. Changing the game too much)	Football started in 1920. 	So, apparently for 100 years every football player is handicap or retarded?	The new sensitive generation is destroying the old school glory of toughness and grit. https://t.co/vuamnpMdR3
#NCAAFootball	These “Targeting” calls are getting way out of whack.	It’s getting to the point that a player doesn’t know whether to tackle or kiss the guy.	Here’s an idea, no more tackling and make all football “flag” football.	Unbelievable. Destroying the game.

@billburr @GamblingPodcast Dude, the Forum is all but sold out for your 9/28 show.	I noticed you have like 2 weeks off prior.	Why can't you tell your agent to book something like September 21-23?	LA has plenty of clubs. I can't get a seat. They're all nose bleed seats. https://t.co/xRXi15sgvS

@Doodisgirl @MarkRicht @CanesFootball Yes we will. I got big stacks on them to win by 9 points or more. https://t.co/hg5U9gzu4U
