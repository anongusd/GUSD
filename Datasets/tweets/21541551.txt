@Kerryboberry does caffeine effect your liver?
@katieee_v i said ? because i dont get the jindal thing.
@katieee_v i thought you were going to bed? why are you still awake?!
@katieee_v ?
caffeine pill at 10:30 pm probably wasn't a good idea. oh well.
I think I've had too much coffee...
@jessferris why? is it dense?
@itsamanda9 the strip on a saturday morning is so fun.
@victoria_rachel good letter tor.
@katieee_v good letter to the editor. you and tori said it perfectly.

@Kerryboberry yes, people wake up at 6. sometimes they wake up even earlier (once i woke up at 4 am and my brothers were still drinking...)
@vanessacominsky who was it? no one makes fun of the boot.
@katieee_v eh the campaign was revolutionary and unprecedented. i kinda wish he talked more about it
@vanessacominsky stupid rude people. what, did they act like they were better than you?
exhausted. what a day. started with an exam i didnt know about ended with talking to david plouffe.
@jjabbott good job again. don't let the crowd size fool you. it was good.
@katieee_v good call. what'd you think?
"Don't get high don't get low just run for the finish line" -plouffe on obamas persona
@vanessacominsky what happened?
"They were in the 20th century we were in the 21st"-Plouffe on the repubs vs dems
Skipping a meeting to see plouffe. He's good.
David plouffe.
@jessferris just talked to shannon. she was confused too.
@jessferris nope.
@gogopopo seriously. i've learned so much more by getting involved on campus.
@jessferris well I never heard from her so I'm not going to do it. i just wanted to make sure i wasnt the only one.
@jjabbott that's awesome. can we get some eagles cheers at the lecture tonight?
@jessferris are you just doing the one assignment? not a reading response?

@itsamanda9 call me if they do
@itsamanda9 i love your oscar updates. now i can just read your twitter instead of watching it.
@jessferris I'm not sure yet. i'll probably put it off for as long as possible. this is an easy assignment. just bullshit it.
@jessferris i feel like that's something she'd love
@jessferris just use something really simple like...peeling an orange and make it into a crazy story.
@jessferris yea. my presentation is about family. so me and meg are gonna use family guy to prove our point
@jessferris haha no. i've been working on my presentation for tomorrow night by watching family guy clips.
@itsamanda9 ah i'm jealous.
@jessferris that you should post on the discussion board. that's way more interesting then telese...
@jjabbott yea we should.
@jessferris are you sure it isn't in the syllabus? I don't want to e-mail her. She'll probably just yell at me.
@schwarzenegger I wish more people thought like that.
