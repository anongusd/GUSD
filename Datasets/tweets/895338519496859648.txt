@jazturingan @cloydreyes @kimbaboys @superduperrcute @ChelDiokno We should not say that, as believers, we should believe the Bible in its entirety not just part alone for our convenience. We should read, believe and live the bible teachings. The word becomes flesh in JESUS as our role model in living here and hereafter.
@ronivi_glomo @ChelDiokno We continue to pray and hope for the best. Just live our life, one day at a time. We can never solve a problem by creating another problem. Let us start small and think the best we can do for our country. History tells us that people power never brought real peace in this land.
@jazturingan @cloydreyes @kimbaboys @superduperrcute @ChelDiokno It was destined to happen. If you believe in prayer, Pray that God's will shall be done on earth as it is in heaven. Keep your faith strong and continue to do good until the day of JESUS comes.
