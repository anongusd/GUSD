.@POTUS says "there's red tape that needs to be cut." -- So you'll support the #REINSAct then? #SOTU
The best way to strengthen #Medicare is to save it from path to bankruptcy. @HouseGOP has offered budgets to do that year after year. #SOTU
.@POTUS talks about making college affordable, yet this time last year proposed taxing 529 savings plan. #SOTU
When @POTUS talks about #jobs &amp; unemployment, some perspective: labor force participation rate is still at 62.6%. #SOTU
.@POTUS begins #SOTU by saying ‚ÄúI hope we can work together this year‚Äù yet circumvents Congress on #2A &amp; #immigration.
