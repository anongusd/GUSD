@tracygee_ @LeftSentThis @shaunking cuz honestly they aren't being brought there for school. I've seen many athletes leave college with life altering injuries and many return home to continue a life of poverty without the ability to make enough money even with a degree. I work in sports. I see it all the time.
@tracygee_ @LeftSentThis @shaunking Not sure if you're an athlete yourself,but kids that make it into college sports have invested a lot of time, money, and their bodies to athletics. I've seen many who are encouraged to take easier courses so they can keep their GPA up,
@gb8200 @BabyJake0016 @KuenningJK24 @kinotg @KoreyKruse @davecdnb @LeftSentThis @shaunking They should be allowed to earn money, but pretty soon they'll be shipping in the majority of the athletes. Ask Obama.
@tellNitstra8 @tracygee_ @LeftSentThis @shaunking Stipend is supposed to fill the gap, because generally there are other costs that the school doesn't cover. My sister had a full ride for basketball at a D-1 school.
@avanveen8 @tracygee_ @1DarrenHoward @LeftSentThis @shaunking Besides that. Why go to school to learn how to be an employee, when you can take the check and learn how to be a boss? He has the opportunity to learn way more where he's headed. He'll learn real things in real time and at a high level. üëçüèæ
@tracygee_ @MyEmpoweredCR @LeftSentThis @shaunking The problem is that a lot of these athletes make money for the school,but have families starving at home. That's why so many get into trouble when they accept money or even work jobs that pay too much. It's not an NBA problem. This is an NCAA monopoly slave system problem.
@tracygee_ @LeftSentThis @shaunking Does that guarantee him a good paying job? No. This is a prime example of exploitation. The college, sponsors, and athletic staff are happy though.

I am one voice among many, but one must remember that it's not the waves, but the under tow that gets you. We are here, growing, moving, and educated on the issues. Democrat/Republican is no longer the  standard for our support. We are watching and listening.
We must throw our gauntlet in the sand. 		If a politician does not support tangible transformative policies that specifically address the #ADOS community starting with H.R.40, we  will not vote for said  candidate until they consistently do so.
All of this and more are the costs of slavery perpetrated historically in this United States of America against our ancestors and this legacy continues today. We are  tired of being the shoes that America walks on and the water that helps lift all boats.

@Free_Spirit2972 @EBONYMag @ChakaKhan I remember downloading songs and not caring about the quality.  I just wanted the song.
@Free_Spirit2972 @EBONYMag @ChakaKhan Napster and other streaming sites were a bigger reason music wasn't being purchased in my opinion, because now you could get the song you liked for free instead of purchasing the whole record.
@Free_Spirit2972 @EBONYMag @ChakaKhan Honestly those kids are probably audiophiles. That's rare. Not to say it will always be that way, but typically when music is being mixed and mastered they do it based on what it most likely will be listened on. Typically headphones.
@Free_Spirit2972 @EBONYMag @ChakaKhan I think the key thng to understand is music is a product for sale. They create and market it 2 the demgrphic they think they'll make the most money from. The music of today is very formulaic as was any music you've ever heard. Understanding the WHY can make it mor interestingüòâüëç

@BunnyCupcakes31 @terrycrews 2/2 in many cases however, they found that things were worse in the house than the field. More house slaves fled than field slaves. Field slaves thought there was hope if they got in the house. House slaves knew their only hope was to escape. #AmericanDOS #Tangibles2020

@Nylocs My thought would be that if you've heard of powernomics then you already know what to do. No need for Tariq to say anything.
@OilmanAndrew @KamalaHarris Only the realists made  it because they lived one day at a time and made the most out of that  day, day in and day out expecting nothing more.
@OilmanAndrew @KamalaHarris However, after further examination even the optimists who believed they  would be rescued at anytime often lost hope in time and ended up giving  in which resulted in giving up and their demise.
@OilmanAndrew @KamalaHarris In fact after looking deeper into the matter, it was  discovered  that usually pessimists died first, closely followed by  optimists which  baffled the command. They thought if anyone would make  it, it would be  the optimists.
@OilmanAndrew @KamalaHarris Case in point.	during the Vietnam conflict, US soldiers who were taken as prisoners of  war and held captive undetected for long periods of time. Once our  troops eventually discovered these camps  and rescued prisoners, the ones who made it (long term) were often  realists.

@angela_rye That only works when you are in a position to negotiate.They know we are the weakest group.Power only respects power.We can't enforce any alliance,  so no group will keep one with us.That's why all we do is March, tweet, and protest.
