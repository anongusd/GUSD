If you can't face your life, then who can? If you don't have the skills to manage what's in your head and your world, there's no one who can do it for you. When you tell yourself you "can't," you must. And you will find ways to motivate. Keep Fighting, it’s worth it. - JNN https://t.co/dwTQoKrPDg

If you refuse to help your customers because you're unreachable, and your customer advocate's response is, "No, I can't help you" or "Sorry we lost your package" or "driver is unavailable," you don't try nor value your customers. @FedEx @FedExHelp
It's bad enough I have to deal with a serious illness. Your customer service department really needs to have a "can do" or "I will help you" attitude, rather than "You just need to wait," and "I can't help." or "I won't help you." @fedex @FedExHelp
@FedEx @FedExHelp Your customer service agents all have a "No, I can not help you attitude." I called multiple times this morning, until someone actually understood the urgency of the situation. Ya'll had me in tears.
@FedEx @FedExHelp I called and pleaded with the agent, who transferred me a Fedex supervisor. Your customers pay and send overnight packages by a certain arrival time, for an urgent reason. I don't know how to track a local office.

I have been judged my whole life by my parents. They told me I would never amount to anything, compared to all the other cousins who are doctors, lawyers pharmacists. I took a different route in life, and now I am still being judged.
At this point, I don't need to be judged for who I am and what I do. When you're sick and you don't feel well, why would you care what people think? Even your own parents.
I just told my parents if they didn't like what I posted on social media that they should go ahead and remove themselves. Not sure if this is the "Asian way" or whatever way, but I honestly don't care.
Be genuine. It's really that simple.

@eventbritehelp @eventbrite @TXWineSpirits They are off today per the Memorial Day weekend and I'm a co-founder of the organization. So it's ok to reach me via email or phone.
@eventbritehelp @eventbrite @TXWineSpirits I think they tried to call your 800 phone number and could not get through. Also your email autoresponder says it takes 1 week for response.
@eventbrite @eventbritehelp There is no event tomorrow. The venue will not appreciate people showing per the listing. Please have them remove this listing immediately.
@eventbrite @eventbritehelp We have no idea how to deactivate the posting. No one on our staff has been able to contact the poster. We received over 100 calls this week
@eventbrite @eventbritehelp if you go the event website, it's listed as 8/26/2017:  https://t.co/0y594bDKOS.  We received 100+ calls from your incorrect event posting.
@eventbrite @eventbritehelp This event listing has the wrong date &amp; we don't know who posted it or how to deactivate the event:  https://t.co/9F9F6I6Se7.  It's not 5/27
