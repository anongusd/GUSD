Talk about twisted logic: Trump waited until *after* the GOP lost control of Congress to declare a wall emergency. Meanwhile, he wasted what little political capital he had on unpopular tax cuts &amp; repealing Obamacare. Seems like an ego emergency, nothing else #FakeTrumpEmergency

One #sotu line that needs correcting: The one thing preventing progress in America isn‚Äôt investigations into legitimately questionable behavior, it‚Äôs a government shutdown over a border wall nobody wants

Unless @realdonaldtrump rejects every political instinct he‚Äôs had over past 2 years, tough to see how #sotu changes any minds. Americans don‚Äôt want a wall, tax cuts for rich, reckless foreign policy.. or (judging by opinion polls) *him* anymore, quite frankly

Rubio can‚Äôt commit to the voters of FL that he'll serve a full term, but he‚Äôs 100% committed to the Koch brothers‚Äô agenda. #FLSen
Rubio will speak at the Kochs‚Äô Americans For Prosperity conference. Unsurprising: he currently has a 100% voting record from them. #FLSen

It‚Äôs shameful that while Sgt. Riley was lying paralyzed &amp; his family struggled to get answers, their Senator was nowhere to be found. #FLSen
Sadly, this is a story that Floridians know too well‚ÄîRubio putting himself &amp; his personal ambition above the needs and concerns of FL #FLSen
He announced his presidential campaign, held at least 18 fundraisers &amp; did not contact the Riney family‚Ä¶ until 5 months later. #FLSen
What was Senator Rubio doing in that same time? #FLSen
From that 1st call, it took Rubio‚Äôs office 5 months to respond. Sgt. Riney was transferred to Tampa. #FLSen https://t.co/NcSob5ulX6

Donald Trump is a candidate of hate &amp; division. Marco Rubio‚Äôs decision to support him puts his political ambition before our state. #FLSen
Rubio just yesterday said "no one" could commit to a 6-year term. Well, Marco: I can. I commit to you that I will serve my full term. #FLSen
Marco Rubio is the worst of Washington. That's why Florida already handed him one loss this year. #FLSen
There are some in Congress who are in it for themselves &amp; there are some beholden to special interest donors. Marco Rubio is both. #FLSen
