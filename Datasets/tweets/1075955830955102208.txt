I was going to be productive today but then I let twitter trigger me
@Washhanger @CoryBooker Hope and kindness arent policy positions and he has been silent on those
@CoryBooker I am a US citizen if you are running for president what are your positions on taxes, education, and health care Ive been watching you post feels shit all day but no content
@Schottey @Ms_Breuer @CoryBooker Nvm didnt when I went back to it still wierd but good info
@Schottey @Ms_Breuer @CoryBooker He also voted to lower standards on american medications also love a linked site that traps me in an ad after 5 seconds
@Schottey @CoryBooker It might be old fashioned but I dont support a candidate who has yet to say 1 thing about his policy dont buy into a personality
All he has done is announce he is running and try to build a likeable personality/look how about you answer some questions about your policy before you ask for our money https://t.co/sb2tKOqgDu
Geometry bitch that coin is a cylinder so it has 3 sides... dont even get me started on those ridges either mate #Truth #woke
When the republican party dies the democrats will all realize that they only agree with 20% of their fellow dems and so it will implode aswell the democratic party could easily split into 3-5 different parties and we must recognize there is no such thing as a 2 sided coin
@Frank666013 @CoryBooker But I agree lol

Im 20, and Im running for president 2020 who is with me
@snoylnimajneb @CoryBooker I love your enthusiasm so much but can we please wait a moment before tossing our hats, the 2020 election is still very far, we will have more candidates than we have ever had, these candidates must prove they do not just try to speak for us but their policy fights for us
RT @jpbrammer: sexually I identify as gay and romantically I identify as a clown
Never vote for a Candidate because you love their passion/personality the policy/procedure they affected is all that matters when they leave office
I won't say hes the worst option, but we do not need a candidate in the pockets of big pharma, he voted against importing cheaper medication from Canada/China because they dont have the same production standards as american meds and also voted to lower standards of american meds https://t.co/5if7ZuUY8p
