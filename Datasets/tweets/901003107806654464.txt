@CBSNews Bring back affordable SRO housing which is privately funded!  Not just for those who agree to govt supervision by sex and drug crazed workers!
@foxandfriends Type of behavior that destroyed affordable, private SRO housing to be replaced by limited public housing not obtainable by working poor and lower middle class!
@thehill Criminals, like Davidson in Dalton, don't obey laws! He broke 7!  Illegal guns abound on the streets already! How hard are these facts to understand? Posturing for votes from millennials who don't think history of dictators seizing guns relates?
@washingtonpost No, blame the Dems who eliminated SRO housing in democratically controlled cities years ago, making housing there unaffordable for millions. Especially those who couldn't get /abide govt housing.
@HuffPost 374 rifles used vs 1300+ knives in homicides. Gonna outlaw steakknives too?

@LindaJoh11 @foxandfriends 90% of Americans need guns to maintain our freedom but we need to weed out the 10% who can't handle the responsibility, don't you agree?  Current system not working. Add military rescreen of all new guns &amp; arrest the 80,000 felons that illegally try to buy?
@duke1962par @foxandfriends I think she is wanting us to protect our freedom &amp; our schools by maintaining the purpose of the 2nd A but preventing the Cruz's from getting weapons.  We need more checks &amp; balances in the system to do that BC locals and ATF/FBI failing to execute.
@PaulaMSpangler @foxandfriends I recently read that 73% of drug possession crimes are charged to illegals.  Anyone have that link?
@foxandfriends Yes. Purpose is to maintain our freedom not empower every immature, irresponsible, cowardly person to kill children.  Use national emergency powers to deploy military to rescreen all new gun buys w psyche tests &amp; react to shooters!

@kaw0606 @NPR I agree. There are ways to immediately locate a shooter within a school and employ technology to frighten and confuse him immediately. Expensive but national emergency powers grants funding!
@NPR Better to deploy defensive technology within schools to deter, confuse and delay shooters and aid the first cops there. Military does it routinely. Use their expertise! National emergency powers to employ military defenses at all schools to buttress cops.
@DonnaWR8 @realDonaldTrump Another analogy is offering your ATM card to someone trespassing on your posted property. Not wise but that is what we have been doing with benefits and illegals.

@gardinercallum @brettgoodrich @jacalope @MrLix @trumps_all @TimONeill49 @CNNPolitics @bbkaksy Cities in US with strictest gun control also have highest rates of homicide. Criminals just don't seem to care about gun laws and are quite happy when their victims do!

@gardinercallum @brettgoodrich @jacalope @MrLix @trumps_all @TimONeill49 @CNNPolitics @bbkaksy This chart also includes self defense, suicide and police cases so the chart using intentional homicides is more relevant.

@gardinercallum @brettgoodrich @jacalope @MrLix @trumps_all @TimONeill49 @CNNPolitics @bbkaksy If you throw the cities with the strictest gun control out of your data you will see the US ranks as one of the safest countries in the world. Counters your argument doesn't it?
@brettgoodrich @jacalope @MrLix @trumps_all @TimONeill49 @CNNPolitics @bbkaksy Kennesaw, GA requires all homeowners to have a gun. No mass shootings there either as far as I know.
