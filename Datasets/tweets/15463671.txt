Clyburn says on MSNBC he’d be open to a deal with Trump on government shutdown that included permanent DACA and larger TPS fix.
Gotta let them score a touchdown here
One thing not being overly appreciated is that if/when McConnell brings this Trump plan up for a vote, and if it fails, he will no longer be able to rely on his talking point that he simply won’t bring legislation to the floor that can’t pass.
In the end, it’s hard to see a “big deal” being agreed to unless it includes some sort of provision that makes it impossible for the government to be shut down again. The hostage taking is the big problem for the Dems here.
It seems fair to note that Trump has offered some concessions here. But only fair if you also note that his administration ended DACA protections and slashed TPS protections in the first place. So his concession is, in part, just to undo the damage he inflicted.
Have to imagine that whatever offer Trump extends today, Pelosi and Schumer’s counter will be: open the government and then we will talk
And here are some of those specifics, which make the deal less enticing to Dems		https://t.co/8onfRZhutE https://t.co/dkB1XBwtNR
Devil is in the details but a $5.7b for wall in exchange for TPS and DACA protections deal should and probably would be considered seriously by Dems. After all, Trump could have had $25b in wall money for these a year ago		Again, wait and see the specifics.

The main legislative effort to end birthright citizenship has been - since 2010 - the product of one Steve King

Grassley says he is still going to be investigating and collecting information on Dr. Ford's allegations. 		“She raised issues in testimony and if you raise issues in your testimony we ought to have information to back it up.”
In the end, Collins and Manchin and many others just endorsed the Ed Whelan theory without going the extra step of trying to name the “actual” assaulter

For the record, it was yuengling and one protestor told the guy to, “get that panther piss out of here.” She wanted a better beer if they were, indeed, offering. https://t.co/W00ENa0cec
The Daily Caller sent a camera and a host to Hart Senate office building to offer booze to the protestors (many of whom are assault survivors) and to ask them if they, like Kavanaugh, like beer. The police made them stop handing out beers

If the FBI’s report is thorough and closes the case completely, it would be interesting to see if Kavanaugh-supporting lawmakers will now say they believe Dr. Ford was lying.
McConnell’s speech is basically saying he believes Dr. Ford is lying without actually saying it.
And as soon as I type that, Schumer says: "I disagree with Sen. Grassley's statement that there was no hint of misconduct." https://t.co/lOaPi5vXxY
If the main line from Feinstein is that “most notable part of this report is what’s not in it,” it implies that there is nothing in the report from the interviews that the FBI did do, that will change the dynamics of the debate.

Why can’t Grassley and Feinstein read the report.... together?
In this case, Kavanaugh supporters would have cause to say why are you just alluding to this now? https://t.co/PJDxc8X4zB
@chrislhayes That would be correct. Republicans notably blocked Obama’s request for opioid funding and shut down the government during spending fights when he was in power. Now, they can play ball.
Dr. Ford’s attorneys have written Grassley saying she is prepared to provided the docs he requested (including therapist notes) to the FBI when she is interviewed. But, they add, “we have not yet heard from the FBI about scheduling an interview with her."
Folks who thinks Democrats are gonna regret trying to stop the Kavanaugh nomination because it’s boosted GOP enthusiasm don’t quite have a solid grasp on the nature of the opposition to the Kavanaugh nomination.
QAnoners believe the Trump text alert test is the first step towards him imposing martial law. They also drew deep meaning from the fact it was 17 words long.  https://t.co/5WIAKBuq35		From, who else but, @willsommer
Not surprising but still notable: 		Support for Kavanaugh among Republicans has grown since the allegations have come out. He is now supported by 84% of Republicans, per Gallup. Compared to 74% who supported Gorsuch’s nomination.
@AaronBlake So far they’re not bad. I wanted worse
One risk being run by GOPers here is that the FBI doesn’t interview these 20-40 witnesses that apparently want to be interviewed; they vote to confirm Kavanaugh anyway; then the witnesses talk after confirmation and reveal new, relevant info.

Senator Leahy is the spring chicken of the first four Senators to read statements here at the Kavanaugh hearing. At 78 years young, he clocks ahead of Feinstein (85), Grassley (84) and Hatch (84)
Amazing to recall, as you read the crazy excerpts of his book on Trump, that (one of) the big Woodward-generated scandals during the Obama administration was his reveal that they may have been responsible for the concept of sequestration. The horror.
Trump on Sessions, per Woodward: “This guy is mentally retarded. He’s this dumb Southerner. … He couldn’t even be a one-person country lawyer down in Alabama.” https://t.co/dz6RSoxnOs

To summarize what's to come: Kavanaugh will call balls and strikes. He'll be pro-law, not pro-politics. He'll respect the institutions not the parties. He'll be unable to answer any real questions because, well, we can't get ahead of ourselves. And he'll be humbled by the moment.
This is becoming a classic of the genre. 		Gorsuch praised Garland too as an "an outstanding judge." https://t.co/BkgDmW4jZJ

@StewSays @AshleySchapitl You ignored the question. But, let’s be honest, I was never gonna actually get answers :)
@StewSays @AshleySchapitl Yes. It is a bit clumsy of them to say it matters in some cases but not in others. But as for McConnell, for whom you speak, are you saying that he doesn’t actually care that Kavanaugh got such high marks from the ABA?
@StewSays @AshleySchapitl no. I think their rating for Kavanaugh does matter actually. It would be weird to stress it doesn’t in some cases and does in others. Don’t you agree?
so…. This is kabuki theater then https://t.co/a4ND2Ce6lJ

About two weeks later I ran into him in the Senate. I was there to report on something totally unrelated. But he pulled me aside and said something akin to: "sorry about that ribbing i gave you." He had this Cheshire cat grin on his face. It was impossible not to smile back (3/5)
"you are confused" he quickly shot back. Gulp. I was frozen. He then proceeded to give me an acid bath on live TV and all i could do was sit there. I deserved it. (2/5)

Why did I tweet all this? Who knows.
It’s difficult for me to comment on whether what they did was wrong or right (these are tough debates for a reason). But I sure as hell know that my perspective on how to object with civility is far different if only because I’m afforded the opportunity far more
They are immigrants and LGBT Americans and they probably have never had an opportunity to express their disapproval with a government official. When presented that opportunity, they took it. And they did so about as calmly as you could in the course of a confrontation
Many of us have a platform to analyze political discourse, cover it, criticize it, etc… That’s true of members too. But the folks at the Red Hen don’t have that.
I’ve tried to avoid the civility debate because it’s largely (almost exclusively) contrived and, honestly, I’m not Emily Post or anything. But I think it’s important to draw a distinction between what an elected official(s) says and what a restaurant owner does (thread)

@chrislhayes yes.
I think it's fair to say Trump's "they're animals" comment was in reference to MS-13, not immigrants at large. 		I think it's also fair to point out the inhumanity of Trump's policy of separating immigrant children from their families and storing them in military warehouses.
Giuliani bemoaning Comey's "totally unethical" treatment of Clinton during the campaign is fantastic
