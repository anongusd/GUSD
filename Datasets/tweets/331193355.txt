“Congress must find out what happened to the millions of dollars that were supposed to be spent on suicide prevention outreach, and then Congress must hold accountable those who failed to take seriously one of the greatest risks faced by veterans.” /end
“A significant portion of the veterans whom our country loses to suicide each day are Vietnam veterans,” noted Rowan.
Out of the $6.2 million budget that the VA is required to spend on suicide prevention, in fiscal year 2018, they had been on track to spend less than one percent on ensuring that veterans gained access to services.
-- and a drop in outreach spending that indicates suicide prevention has been all but forgotten.
The Government Accountability Office report released yesterday, “Improvements Needed in Suicide Prevention Media Outreach Campaign Oversight and Evaluation,” revealed a disturbing reversal in VA’s trend in suicide-prevention outreach
For the VA to abandon suicide-prevention outreach is essentially akin to malpractice on a massive scale.”
“Studies have shown that veterans who receive VA healthcare are far less likely to die by suicide than their peers, which makes outreach the most important part of the VA’s suicide-prevention program.
...it appears the VA has nearly completely abandoned that mission,” said John Rowan, VVA National President..

25/ How else can people help? Get involved like @RileyTopping did, writing an opinion piece in @thehill encouraging the government to do more to help veterans combat disinformation campaigns. https://t.co/LaK8QWmtl1
24/ We ask that those who can afford it, please subscribe to the above publications. Please follow these journalists and support their work. Without them, we'd be unable to stand up to the powerful and to help troops and veterans in such big and groundbreaking ways.
23/ A sincere thank you to all of the journalists who have helped us expose this issue. And thanks to @facebook's Threat Intelligence Team and @Twitter's Site Integrity Team for working with us to curb the influence of hostile powers who seek to do troops and vets harm online.
22/ As we said in the latest by @nikkiwentling, "This is an issue of national security, and affects the well-being of American troops and vets... we’re asking for the blame game to end, and for America’s government to step up and protect our population." https://t.co/St5RZwiNUO
21/ Now that the problem has been identified, it's time to work towards a solution. Calling for heads at private companies is a waste of energy -- it's time for us all to work together to secure our democracy and protect veterans from being the targets of foreign adversaries.
20/ The @WSJ story broke this week, but it seems this is still just the beginning. We've been getting a few additional tips from our members and followers that we'll need to follow up on. Just starting to share our research with cyber-security pros and researchers.
19/ We also began sharing some of our @Twitter related findings with their Site Integrity Team. Twitter has *not* been the focus of our investigation, but 1) cross-referencing FB Pages with 2) affiliated websites, with 3) connected Twitter accounts, often helps ID networks.
18/ After July, we agreed to give WSJ the exclusive on our most-recent findings, so we went dark and quietly continued our research. We provided full access to our notes to FB's Threat Intel Team and the WSJ Journalists.
17/ In July 2018, we started using graphics from a November 2018 @washingtonpost piece by @dtkeating @kevinschaul and @lmshap to help us identify confirmed #Russian propaganda on the pages we had already been researching. Spoiler alert: WE FOUND A LOT.  https://t.co/Tfdd3Uc5gW
16/ On July 13, 2018 we had our first opportunity to meet @facebook's Threat Intelligence Team in DC. There we presented our preliminary findings, and **during the meeting** they started shutting down pages that we flagged that broke FB rules (incl two sharing nude pics of vets)
15/ By then, @facebook's Threat Intelligence Team was taking VVA seriously, and they quickly acted to remove a network of pages that had been sharing the photo in question. Big thanks goes to @clairecmc's @SenateHSGACDems staff for facilitating that introduction.
14/ Using the same methods that helped us figure out that the fake-VVA trolls were in Bulgaria, @JournoGeoffZ's piece tipped us off so that we could discover the political meme with the #GoldStarWife was being shared by *many* pages run by trolls outside the US.
13/ On June 7, 2018, @JournoGeoffZ of @MilitaryTimes wrote about a #GoldStar wife appealing to people to stop sharing a photo of her over her husband's casket as a political meme. This made us realize we needed to expand our investigation...  https://t.co/QqURJsF17N

11/ On April 13, 2018, @JaneLytv of @BuzzFeed discovered an even larger network of pages than VVA had found. The same foreign entity ran lots of pages aimed at deceiving veterans, and @facebook shut them all down as soon as Jane sent questions about them. https://t.co/kpnBeSxrkd
10/ The next day, @NatashaBertrand wrote in @TheAtlantic about VVA's report and the E&amp;C Committee's role in ensuring veterans are protected online.    https://t.co/N18nQatXyu
9/ On April 11, 2018 at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing, @HouseCommerce Chairman @repgregwalden cited VVA's report and challenged @facebook CEO #MarkZuckerberg to start working to protect veterans online. https://t.co/Yc2zPwvqE9
8/ In Feb/March 2018 we discovered that the Bulgarian trolls were at it again, and prepared a report for congress and various federal agencies. We called on @DeptVetAffairs and @DeptofDefense to respond. Read the report and see the list of recipients here: https://t.co/G6GPwP2uUX
7/ @ScottShaneNYT and @MikeIsaac then helped to put VVA's fight against foreign fake veteran pages into the larger context of foreign influence campaigns targeting the American electorate with their piece in @nytimes on November 3, 2017. https://t.co/QtXmHvywQ9
6/ @TaskandPurpose then amplified @nikkiwentling's @starsandstripes piece, helping to ensure that a larger audience became aware that there were foreign trolls targeting veterans for disinformation campaigns. https://t.co/jT27KFqYqt
5/ Days later, @nikkiwentling was able to report that we succeeded in having the imposter VVA page taken down. https://t.co/uLrhfFRS4b
4/ The following week, @nikkiwentling of @starsandstripes amplified our call for help in taking down a @facebook page (that we later learned was run by trolls in Bulgaria) which was imitating VVA, and specifically targeting Vietnam Veterans. https://t.co/uLrhfFRS4b
3/ On October 10, 2017, @LeoShane of @MilitaryTimes wrote about the Oxford Study that identified veterans as targets of hostile actors using disinformation campaigns, and VVA's first public call for action to protect our community. https://t.co/rBWCMwCVPY

VA reports at hearing only 9,000 #veterans have filed claims related to #BurnPit illnesses. Unknown number made service connected or rejected. No information on what causes most rejections of claims.
.@RepBrianMast continues listing things he saw burned, tasted in his food, breathed every day thanks to #BurnPits and destroyed weapons caches. "Burned tires, MRE wrappers, medical waste, human waste, possible chemical weapons, the dust of sandstorms, chemical drums, fuel..."
Newest member of @HouseVetAffairs, @RepBrianMast: "As a veteran, what's disturbing to me, is that the worst chemical attacks were coming from our side in the form of #BurnPits."
.@RepClayHiggins begins + ends his comments calling out DoD. "Like my colleagues, I am absolutely disturbed that DoD didn't show up to this #BurnPit hearing... I want everyone here, #veterans, #VSOs and members to roar together, and let everybody know DoD did not join us today."
.@DeptVetAffairs "we don't yet have enough evidence to presume that #BurnPit exposures cause illnesses and injuries." @RepBetoORourke presses VA to reveal we're at minimum 3 years away from studies to connect #BurnPits to illnesses.
.@RepBetoORourke "I agree with Chairman @RepJackBergman. I am incredibly disappointed that the @DeptofDefense ducked this #BurnPit hearing. This is important, and it says a lot that they chose not to be here."
.@RepBetoORourke to VSOs: I'm reminded time after time, the progress that we make on this committee is because of pressure from you... I love that @DrPhilRoe brought up that it took our country far too long to acknowledge the damage of #AgentOrange."
.@RepGusBilirakis just invited #veterans who have been exposed to #BurnPits to visit his office. "I've seen the documentaries, so I understand there's a problem. But I want to hear your personal stories... this is like #AgentOrange, really tragic."
Chairman @DrPhilRoe "We have a phenomenal opportunity in the coming years as @DeptofDefense and @DeptVetAffairs move to combine their electronic health records. We'll be able to track the entire population to detect unusual health issues arising from #BurnPits."
Chairman @DrPhilRoe "we need to find out if the #ToxicExposures are also just part of the environment in Afghanistan. I've been there many times, and that's what it looks like to me."
.@JuliaBrownley26 continues: "I was disturbed to hear the part of @VFWHQ's testimony regarding the lack of research on the effect of #BurnPits on #WomenVeterans and their children. It's heartbreaking to hear about the woman veteran having 3 children with birth defects."
.@JuliaBrownley26 "I think the best way to solve this problem is just end the use of #burnpits." We concur, Rep Brownley! The health of our #military and #veterans is a #NationalSecurity issue. #Toxic#xposures should be limited in every way possible.
.@VetsHealthCo's Dr Tom Berger: "The reason we're so invested in looking into #burnpits is because we believe they may be the #AgentOrange of this new generation."
"An additional area of concern," VFW's Wiseman continues, "research is needed to discover how #BurnPits impact future generations."
"Veterans deserve to know what is making them sick" - Ken Wiseman of @VFWHQ at #BurnPits hearing. "We need to know the effects of #BurnPits on women and reproductive issues."
.@VFWHQ's Wiseman continues: "Congress must require all #burnpit data to be shared publicly so that it can be accessed by outside researchers... greater access to evidence can be used to support sick veterans' claims."
.@VFWHQ's Kenneth Wiseman testifying now. "VFW is glad to see 140,000 members have signed up for the #BurnPit list, we're concerned that Congress and the @DeptVetAffairs are not yet implementing changes quick enough to improve the registry."
.@iava's @TomPorterDC continues w a story of an Iraq vet. "Part of her job in #Iraq was to pour jet fuel onto burning human feces, and stir it with an e-tool until it dried into a brick that she could bury in the desert. Now she's extremely sick and needs help."
.@TomPorterDC of @iava testifying now: "I deployed to #OEF with healthy lungs, and returned home to be diagnosed with asthma after being exposed to #toxic @BurnPits."
It is upsetting, but not surprising that @DeptofDefense chose not to participate in today's hearing on #BurnPits. As Chairman @DrPhilRoe said, "service members of today and tomorrow deserve to know what the Department of Defense is doing to protect them."
For decades, our organizations, including @VFWHQ @DAVHQ @AmericanLegion @iava @Burnpit360 and more have seen tons of anecdotal evidence about health risks of #ToxicExposures, we're yet to see Congress mandate adequate research to protect the health of veterans.
Potential sources of these exposures include, but are not limited to, #DepletedUranium used in military armor and munitions, #toxins from burning oil refineries and destroyed weapons plants, and more than 260 open-air Burnpits used for disposal of all forms of waste.
VVA statement for the record at #burnpit hearing: "In the Post-9/11 era, it is estimated that as many as 3 million American service members may have been exposed to dangerous toxins during their deployments overseas.
Tune in now to see the #burnpit hearing where @iava @VFWHQ are testifying before congress in favor of research and healthcare to help #veterans who have experienced #ToxicExposure 	@HouseVetAffairs @VetAffairsDems	https://t.co/ciIAA1jlvU
