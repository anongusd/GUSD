@adamlangleben https://t.co/pb9FRsxvIR
@WarmongerHodges You are of course free to interpret @adamlangleben’s article however you please, though I doubt whether many people who’ve read it will agree with you. What about your assertion that on the day of a terrorist attack I smeared part of the community as ‘the wrong kind of Jews’?
@delayedflightt Don’t make me cry, Emily. Not now 💕
@WarmongerHodges Not only was that retweeted before news of the massacre broke, as i think you well know, it is a measured piece written by a Jewish Labour activist that doesn’t ‘smear’ anyone. Would you like to rethink what you’ve just tweeted, or are you happy to stand by it?
@edtorsney @hereforparrilla @Sara_Rose_G Conflating Israel and the Nazi regime is a classic antisemitic trope. That isn’t standing in solidarity with the victims of hate. It’s implying tthat they had it coming.
@edtorsney @hereforparrilla @Sara_Rose_G You linked far right hate - which has just killed Jews in a terrorist attack - to Israel, in a thread discussing hate directed at Jews.  Can you understand why many people would see that as victim blaming?
@edtorsney @hereforparrilla @Sara_Rose_G Actually, I’ve just checked and it was even worse. She was retweeting full-on personal, antisemitic abuse, I told her to take a break andyou decided to chip in  on the subject of Israeli flags. Way to show solidarity with victims of far right hate, Edward.
@edtorsney @hereforparrilla @Sara_Rose_G Edward, the day after a terrorist attack on a synagogue, you responded to my retweet of Sara’s thread about antisemitism by doing exactly what she was talking about. Copying her in, and withouta word of solidarity, you started talking about Israel.
@edtorsney @hereforparrilla @Sara_Rose_G You responded to a young British Jewish woman tweeting about her personal experiences of antisemitism by demanding that she explain why Israeli flags were at a right wing rally. Do you feel that was an appropriate response to her thread?
@momowonton Thank YOU! 😘
@Sara_Rose_G 🥧👈
@boloolu Sending you all the love and hope 💚💛💚💛
@edtorsney @hereforparrilla @Sara_Rose_G Edward, people have been murdered. Members of their community,m are grieving and justifiably frightened. Which other minority community would you feel good about attacking while they were trying to come to terms with a massacre of civilians?
This is a beautiful thing. It gives me hope, too 💖 https://t.co/Bm1ucF4kEI

@benmfreeman @francesweetman I feel sick to my stomach at the thought of Jewish people leaving this country out of fear of a Labour government.
@NoMoreExperts Firstly, you're misrepresenting what the author wrote. Secondly, you're claiming that the multiple published and broadcast accounts of antisemitism within Corbyn's Labour Party from other Jewish people don't exist.
@NoMoreExperts Are you about to present eye-witness accounts that contradict the writer, or to put forth the stunningly original idea that 'the Jews are out to get Corbyn'?

@frankly_no @AlanGrear @lumos Volunteers often have very good intentions but don’t understand that what they’re doing is harmful. There’s a reason countries in the developed world don’t put their own children in orphanages: they know they have very bad outcomes. Instead they prioritise community-based 1/2
@JonCarre @AlanGrear @lumos Yes, existing studies suggest life outcomes are similarly poor for all institutionalised children.

@digitalgoonie @lumos or education only within an institution, or by coercing mothers into parting with their babies, cause lasting harm. There are even orphanages set up as businesses to attract foreign donations and offer volunteer experiences. There are better ways to donate and volunteer, 2/3
@digitalgoonie @lumos Teaching children to accept physical affection from total strangers is psychologically damaging at best. At worst, it renders them vulnerable to abuse. Children need their families and systems that encourage families to split, whether by offering food, medical care 1/3
@AlanGrear @lumos 80% of the world’s institutionalised children have at least 1 living parent who wants them. There are ways to volunteer which help keep families together, rather than driving a model of ‘care’ that causes terrible harm, often for profit. See @lumos website for more info 3/3
@AlanGrear @lumos We have 80 years of research proving that children raised in orphanages are likely to suffer developmental delays, stunting and psychological trauma. 1/5 will have a criminal record, 1/7 will be involved in the sex trade and 1/10 will kill themselves. 2/3
@AlanGrear @lumos The point being made is, in fact, about empathy. Volunteers, although often with the best intentions, cause harm by offering affection for limited periods and then vanishing. One of the ways in which institutions harm children is by creating attachment disorders. 1/3

@AlecMustafayev @lumos @FLOTUS When children have a revolving door series of ‘carers’, it causes immense harm. Please read more on the @lumos website, where you will see firsthand accounts from children themselves.
@AlecMustafayev @lumos @FLOTUS Even ‘orphanages’ set up with the best intentions have the same poor outcomes. However, we also know that a huge number are set up to attract foreign donations and for voluntourism. This is a form of trafficking.
@AlecMustafayev @lumos @FLOTUS 80% of the world’s institutionalised children have at least one living parent, Alec. 80 years research shows that putting children in orphanages severely impacts their physical and mental health.

@jdpaul24 @NudderingNudnik @BBCr4today Honest question: are you unable to use Google? Why is the burden of explanation on the person suffering? Why do they have to endlessly prove that what they’re saying is truthful and justified?
@OliverBullough @NickCohen4 Words to gladden every writer’s heart!
@NickCohen4 I’m starting to think you don’t listen to a word I say.
@Airport70 It’s a thread, not a single tweet. Did you read the whole thing and feel hate, fear and anger towards the individual who wrote it?
@MichaeIStevo I’d be disappointed if you didn’t.
Unfair question in my view, because it would depend who was speaking. Non-bigots in the wizarding world would say half-blood. Pure blood supremacists would say mudblood. In my view, you should have got the point. https://t.co/l3XkBaBeMI
And there we have it, within minutes. Not a word of human sympathy. The actions of Israel’s government justify making British Jews unhappy and afraid. Yes, Jews are bringing it on themselves by being Jewish. https://t.co/H6nRPmbXxn
This thread is the perfect litmus test. If you can read it without empathy for the writer’s pain and fear; if you immediately assume an agenda; if, above all, your response to the distress of a British Jew is to shrug and talk about the Israeli government, then you test positive. https://t.co/9WvsxXm1b3

@simonmaginn @SCynic1 And thus did the anti-Semite loftily indicate that he was no longer interested in debate.
@simonmaginn @SCynic1 You don't want to understand in the slightest, because if you did, you'd be reading those accounts right now. What you want is to accuse a Jew of lying. You're projecting your own bad faith onto @SCynic1 and you're projecting your own bullying onto me.
@simonmaginn @SCynic1 How about you explain - publicly, to Twitter, to the world - why you've taken it upon yourself to attack a Jew, demanding that they explain themselves, when there are literally hundreds of accounts currently online explaining how British Jews currently feel?
@simonmaginn @SCynic1 'If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past. It is not that they are afraid of being convinced.' 		Jean-Paul Sartre, 'Anti-Semite and Jew'
@simonmaginn @SCynic1 'They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert.' Sartre, Anti-Semite and Jew
@simonmaginn @SCynic1 'it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti‐Semites have the right to play.' 		Jean-Paul Sartre, 'Anti-Semite and Jew'.
This is the shattering effect of institutionalising children. #FamiliesBelongTogether @lumos https://t.co/h48cwhyF84

Seeing mass incarceration of young children in the US is truly shocking. The evidence on child institutions has been clearcut for decades: they cause long term trauma, render children vulnerable to abuse and too often lead to disappearances. #ReuniteFamiliesNow
Across the developing world, children with living parents are persuaded to institutionalise them, often with the promise of food, medical care or education, which frequently fails to materialise. Yet across the West, we banned ‘orphanages’ long ago, knowing the harm they cause.
Institutionalisation was especially prevalent in Eastern Europe, where children were taken from their families to be ‘raised’ in state-run institutions. The statistics on these children’s subsequent life outcomes are appalling. (See @lumos website for all research)
13 years ago, I co-founded @lumos, which works to stop child incarceration, reunite families a the truth about child institutions, often wrongly called ‘orphanages.’ There is a huge body of research to show that institutionalising children causes profound harm.
Caging children is child abuse. Forcibly splitting children from their parents is child abuse. This should not be a left/right issue. This is humane versus inhumane, right versus wrong. https://t.co/Yy7VTEXXIC

Please read some of the stories I've just retweeted. An estimated 8 million children are living in institutions worldwide. They are effectively silenced until they emerge at the other end, far too often broken by a system of 'care' that should be abolished. @lumos https://t.co/ML7jlLV3K6

FYI, I say 'orphanages' in previous tweets because we know that 80% of children in institutions worldwide have at least one living parent. The overwhelming majority are loved and wanted, but driven into institutions because of poverty, discrimination, disability or disaster.
I'm afraid all 'orphanages' do harm to children. Murals on the walls, pretty duvet covers, donated teddies and pleasant staff cannot meet a child's core needs. Institutionalisation is proven, no matter how well-intentioned, to do harm. Please see the @lumos website for evidence. https://t.co/X4xE6smWYb
@TimothyThomasCo I can certainly understand that wish. I'd give you a better family if I could. Hope you're doing far better these days x

Again: we need to listen to the people who've been through institutionalisation. 		Mike, I'm so happy to know you're where you belong x https://t.co/nbjlK0olzW
Listen to the people who've actually experienced institutionalisation. They are the (often remarkable) individuals who can tell the truth about the lived reality behind bleak statistics. https://t.co/0z9Cg7YjEU
@LizzieAMcC You should be incredibly proud of yourself. My heart breaks for those who didn't make it in one piece.
Scary. Slytherin. https://t.co/CbmD8M6EhY
If you still need convincing, please go to the @lumos website, read the testimony of institutionalised children themselves and the first hand accounts of people who know the reality of this outdated, broken system. 10/X
There are many ways to meaningfully support children in desperate circumstances. We need to put funds into inclusive education, health and welfare, children can access from home. We need to develop foster care, support families and stop funding and volunteering at orphanages. /9
1 in 5 institutionalised children will end up with a criminal record. 1 in 7 will enter the sex trade and 1 in 10 will kill themselves. Institutionalising children is an inhumane practice and ought to be outlawed internationally. /8
We know that institutions are too often  created to attract foreign aid and volunteers. There are documented instances of children being kept hungry and abused between volunteer visits. Orphanages can prove a lucrative business model. /7
- sometimes in truly horrific ways. We know (from wealth of research, also easily accessed through @Lumos and other NGOs working in this area) that institutionalisation is closely linked to trafficking. /6
Parents are told that their children will only receive education, medical care, or even food, if they are put into the institution. When money is poured into ‘orphanages’ rather than community-based health, welfare and schools, children suffer - /5
Research shows (much of which is easily accessed on the @Lumos website) that the primary reasons children enter institutions are poverty, disability, discrimination and emergencies such as war or natural disasters. /4
Foster care has far better outcomes for children who can’t live with their families, or have no family. It is a common misconception in the developed world that children in foreign orphanages are there because the family was unfit to care for them. 3/
We have 80 years of solid research that prove children in institutions (even well-run orphanages, set up with good  intentions) cause children psychological and physical harm /2
The alternative to an abusive family should never be institutionalisation, for many good reasons /1 https://t.co/X7HzqqRptn

80% of institutionalised children have at least one parent, but extended family, foster care and small scale family-style care units are always preferable to orphanages. @lumos https://t.co/UpktwDwjoH
Great question! See here: https://t.co/Gz1qhtaz97 		Remember, though, that many children don't 'need' institutions at all. They are there because people are profiting out of them and desperate parents had no alternative or were promised medical care/food. https://t.co/ga9o5ip0jv
You clearly care and want to help, which is a wonderful thing. Please go to https://t.co/4JJz4s7qhd, where you'll find long-term, independent studies on this issue along with ways to genuinely transform these children's lives. #voluntourism @lumos
Unfortunately, there is a huge body of research showing that even well run institutions cause developmental delays, physical stunting and attachment disorders. The poor life outcomes of institutionalised children repeat across both 'good' and 'for profit' orphanages. @lumos https://t.co/MsfwBEzElM
There is a reason first world countries closed orphanages for good. They cause harm to children. Please read more before donating or volunteering. https://t.co/4JJz4s7qhd 5/X
80 years of research into the effects of growing up in institutions are damning. One study found that 1 in 3 institutionalised children end up homeless, 1 in 5 have a criminal record, 1 in 7 are involved in prostitution and 1 in 10 kill themselves. https://t.co/KmCjJln565 4/
The third most important reason for children being institutionalised is war/natural disasters. These children are at great risk of being trafficked and reuniting them with family should be the number one priority 3/
The second most important reason for children ending up in so-called 'orphanages' is disability. Foreign donations should be supporting inclusive education systems so that disabled kids can go to school while living with their families. @lumos 2/
The number one reason that children are put into institutions is poverty. Donate to NGOs that support families! Parents usually give up their kids only because they have no alternative means of accessing food/medical care @lumos (thread) 1/
For anyone who wants to help those 8 million institutionalised children, there are ways to do so ethically. This is a solvable problem! Please visit https://t.co/4JJz4s7qhd to find out more.
