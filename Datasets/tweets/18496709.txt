@DeepStateExpose @davidshockey Too often I‚Äôve seen folks instigate an arrest just to have a video go viral.  What is your desired outcome?
@DeepStateExpose @davidshockey All this could be resolved at the station and giving the officer a hard time doesn‚Äôt help a thing.
@DeepStateExpose @davidshockey I have a little problem with this.  Yes, he has the right to preach the gospel of Jesus on a public sidewalk... but this is just a clip of the arrest and not whether he was engaging in constitutional protected speech.  The bystander filming, should just do that, film.

@FederalSpyGuy Oh sure, the media will give airtime to Pelosi, Schumer, @aoc and two others.  People will be pissed because @realDonaldTrump shutdown the TV for 6 hours
@spamruler @ChadPergram Government workers cannot
@TeamPelosi You piss away more than that everyday
@TeamPelosi Actually you are as responsible as he is simply because you don‚Äôt wish to work together... do you remember tip O‚ÄôNeal and Reagan? Both hot about half of what they want.  Keeping government shut down over 1/10th of 1% of the budget is like driving 30 miles to save 30 cents on gas
@rossgarber That does not include the potus.  He has constitutional authority to call a joint session of Congress
@Bobbybeige2 @SpeakerPelosi @POTUS But 106 years of precedent says he gives it before a joint session.  You don‚Äôt want to mess with precedent do you? Plus the @potus has constitutional authority to provide SOTU anyway he sees fit https://t.co/r1Re7b6b3b
@SpeakerPelosi can say she won‚Äôt approve a resolution for a joint session of Congress but @POTUS has Constitutional authority to call a special session of the Congress and has authority to provide Congress the #SOTU however he sees fit.  If he exercises that right, I image...
The SOTU address has occurred every year since 1913, so for 106 years a joint session of Congress has convened.  In 1986 Ronald Regan Delayed the SOTU after the Challenger Disaster and rescheduled for Feb 4th.
@SpeakerPelosi excuse that #sotu security would be affected by government shutdown, @POTUS stated that there is  no security issue.  Speaker Pelosi sends another letter that House will not authorize joint session with congress -   SOTU is a constitutional requirement https://t.co/lUuPatTMqV

More than 42,000 Native Americans served in the military in the Vietnam Era, and over 90 percent of these Servicemembers were volunteers. 90%!
Approximately 10,000 Native Americans served in the military during Korean War. Three were awarded the Medal of Honor.
FACT: More than 30 other tribes served as Code Talkers during WW2, in addition to the Navajo Tribe.
Please get this correct, because I criticize one Native American specifically, #NathanPhillips I am not criticizing  Native Americans generally.  This is a FACT: A higher percentage of Native Americans served post-9/11 than any other ethnicity.

Thank you https://t.co/xtzpscLan2
@bmkrol @d_mccarthy37 @thedailybeast @LizMair Thank you for your awesome review of my twitter account - I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve read each of the 100000 tweets since 2008 to come to that conclusion.
@bmkrol @d_mccarthy37 @thedailybeast @LizMair ‚ÄúYou clowns‚Äù - you have made another major assumption here.  Because I disagree with your loose definitions and logic, we must be republican. Have I called you one name or assumed your politics? You don‚Äôt know us. Be careful about painting with such a wide brush
But of course, democrats are blowing up my timeline because they have their own definition of a ‚Äòwave election‚Äô and can‚Äôt handle statistical data analysis from those of us who have been developing models for decades and consider historical precedent of midterm electorate behavior
One could equate that higher turnout due to a record number of GOP retiring or didn‚Äôt seek re-election and encouraged the democratic base to participate because incumbent rule was not in effect in those districts and states.
On the argument of turn out.  Democrats did indeed turn out at higher levels and voter participation rate did reach 49% which is 9% higher than statistical average of 40% of eligible voters, voting in midterms
Trollers on whether 2018 was a wave election also should note there was 57 GOP who either retired or didn‚Äôt seek re-election in 2018.  This was unprecedented.  A wave usually includes unseating incumbents.
a wave election ‚Äî an election in which one party makes substantial gains in the House and Senate. A large number of incumbents lose their seats but almost all of the defeated incumbents come from one party. https://t.co/1u7xTK9dsH
@bmkrol @d_mccarthy37 @thedailybeast @LizMair 3 senate seats gain and no history book or rational review of statistics gave the GOP most advantage in 100 years.  Feel good about your win, but don‚Äôt re-define  a term that has been clearly standardized statistically for more than 100 yrs. 1994, 2010 were wave elections.
@d_mccarthy37 @thedailybeast @LizMair And you can ignore the gains in the senate.  Do some research on examples of wave elections.  It‚Äôs not about telling myself anything, it‚Äôs about historical record and substantial gains in both house and senate. Obama was shellacked in 2010.  Trump was hurt in 2018
@InformantGuard @thedailybeast @LizMair Been doing election analysis for 25 years.  You just don‚Äôt know the definition of a wave election.  The last example of such is 2010.  Had you read our Politisite political projections over the years you might actually understand what a wave election is.
@d_mccarthy37 @thedailybeast @LizMair Sorry, In the United States when one party makes major gains in the House AND Senate.  https://t.co/ctQP2gNaw7 a wave election example is 2010

Senate  #BlueWave occurred 1900 when democrats took control of the senate with 12 seats.
A #bluewave is 45 (10%) seats in house and /or a change in party control.  In the senate a blue wave would constitute 10 (10%) senate and/or control of the Senate - a true blue was occurred in 1948 with a democratic gain of 75 house seats.  1930 58seats.

While I‚Äôm seeing hundreds of tweets proclaiming #scotus nominee #KavanaughConfirmation guilty based on a research Psychologist passing a polygraph,  one should see our previous tweets and citations on the validity of a polygraph
(Continued) As Dr. Saxe and ...psychologist Gershon Ben-Shahar (1999) note, "it may, in fact, be impossible to conduct a proper validity study." In real-world situations, it's very difficult to know what the truth is. https://t.co/V8uzcijdk6
from the #APA ‚ÄúThere is no evidence that any pattern of physiological reactions is unique to deception. An honest person may be nervous when answering truthfully and a dishonest person may be non-anxious.‚Äù https://t.co/V8uzcijdk6
So when I ( The Editor) see articles like, ‚ÄòFord Ph.D. passed a Polygraph‚Äô  I am just a bit skeptical.  I look forward to her testimony and a Justice Kavanagh responses.
Those with training in biofeedback,  mediation and dissociative states can manipulate the results of a polygraph by using such conditioning.    #NSA #FBI #JAMA #NIMH medical research is full of evidence.  search #Medline https://t.co/l6d6RO6dak
Here is the reason polygraphs are usually inadmissible in court.  ‚ÄòNSA Whistleblower Reveals How To Beat a Polygraph Test‚Äô - keep in mind the accuser is a research psychologist who understands and probably has used similar devices #Kavanaugh  https://t.co/4FEpubrA09

So based on our polling analysis toss-up races could fall 5 (R) and 4 (D) understanding that multiple races are within the polls margin of error - the only disagreement, however small, we have with RCP is we have TN going Republican. Politisite Projects +1 (R)
In TN for US Senate Blackburn (R) is up by 0.5%
In IN for US Senate we have Donnelly (D) up by 2 points
In MO for US Senate we have Hawley (R) up by 0.67%
In ND for US Senate we have Cramer R up by 4 points
In MT for US Senate we have Tester D up by 4 points
In NV for US Senate we have Rosen D up by 1 point
In AZ for US Senate we have Krysten Sinema D up by 2 pecentage points
In Florida Senator Race we have Scott up by 1.0 percentage point - three polls have Scott R and Nelson D tied
Texas RCP calls toss up - We have Ted Cruz ahead by 4 percentage points.  Last poll had him up by 9 but we threw it out per our model
According to Real Clear Politics there are 9 toss-up seats for the United States Senate.  With no toss-ups and based on current polling the senate will remain at 49 D and 51 R.  Next several tweets will look at each toss-up with our (Politisite political projections) https://t.co/liDzBF8Nxr

@SenFeinstein Senator, hiding facts means not hanging in to a letter from a constituent for 6 weeks during a confirmation hearing.  Maybe having the FBI investigate so all the facts were available to the committee.  This appears to be a delaying tactic rather than a search for the truth.

I would like all veterans who follow us to know @BWWings Buffalo Wild Wings (owned by inspire brands) has limited its military discount to 2 days a week.  BWW giveth and taketh away.
@BWWings Sorry you got hacked, but maybe you deserve it.  Been going to BWW every week for three years to play trivia and find out your military discount has been limited to 2 days a week.  That would be fine if I served the country part time.

Should Veterans with a BAD Conduct Discharge be prohibited from purchasing a firearm? #NRA #TexasShooting #ATF
FACT CHECK - Bad conduct discharge IS NOT not under dishonorable conditions.
Under ATF definitions on question 11F on prohibited persons ‚Äúhas been discharged from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions‚Äù
@adamhousley say hello to your wife for us - knew you were a ball player, but thought you told me you were a vet. maybe that was @andylevy
@adamhousley ‚Äúhave you been discharged from the armed forces under other than honorable conditions‚Äù
@adamhousley although he did lie on the domestic violence question - but the ATF and congress should coincider changing question to...
@adamhousley a bad conduct discharge is NOT a dishonorable the ATF is clear  - this probably needs to be changed https://t.co/KDQt46vDx2
@GovMikeHuckabee but Air Force completely dropped the ball the family advocacy management team or other authority should have reported
@GovMikeHuckabee Devin Kelley should be looked at with greater intensity.  I‚Äôm thinking a bad conduct d/c should be disqualifying #ATF
@GovMikeHuckabee now as far as being able to conceal or open carry - depending on the state, he could not get a permit or license to carry
@GovMikeHuckabee 11i on that form is disqualifying being convicted of domestic violence https://t.co/bXFCiz3BZR

Democrats replace the word opioid with abortion ... would you be supporting this? Thought healthcare issues were between a DR and Patient
If a patient needs pain meds, they shouldn‚Äôt have to go through a brick wall ( Gov Christie) to get them
Violating patient doctor confidentiality because of government interference? What happened to GOP and Democrats on privacy?
I thought medical issues were between the patient and the doctor Democrats? So you want a CC to the DEA on prescriptions?
This war on opioids is problematic.. people with  real pain issues are going to be caught in government red tape and interference.

So how is it with over 10k followers my tweets are only seen by a fraction of the whole?  @Twitter is begging for $$ for a larger audience
