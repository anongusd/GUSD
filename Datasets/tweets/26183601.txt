@TanaDJoseph Sure sign that she knows her argument is flawed. Nothing you said is block-worthy.
@TanaDJoseph That thread is garbage. Totally agree with your statement. Feminism is definitely not to blame. I think blaming her regrets on feminism is a cop out.
@Roxigrover @ronikpe @DrLeanaWen Again, citing an anti-woman source isn‚Äôt the same as science. Show me the peer reviewed study from a reputable scientific source. You can‚Äôt.
@Roxigrover @ronikpe @DrLeanaWen Listen. I‚Äôm a real life scientist. I know what real data and real resources are. Pushing your anti-woman garbage here is pointless. Science doesn‚Äôt say that a fetus is a life that can be killed. If you want to stand on your religion, fine. But science doesn‚Äôt support you.
@AdamPiersen Ok. So if you believe in enforcing state laws, do you also support universal background checks?
@Roxigrover @ronikpe @DrLeanaWen That page is from a pro-life student organization, not scientists. Cherry picking articles in an attempt to prove your point doesn‚Äôt actually prove your point. It just makes you look ignorant.
@Roxigrover @ronikpe @DrLeanaWen You can‚Äôt die if you aren‚Äôt alive. And if you consider a fetus to be alive, there are far more miscarriages than abortions. So your time would be better spent on improving women‚Äôs health than spouting ignorant nonsense.
@Roxigrover @ronikpe @DrLeanaWen That‚Äôs not news and it has nothing to do with this conversation.
@AdamPiersen So you agree with my original post that gun laws aren‚Äôt being appropriately enforced and we need reform to make the system work.

@AdamPiersen Authorities should have confiscated, yes. To say we shouldn‚Äôt take his gun because he‚Äôll just get another one is lunacy. Should we not punish thieves because they might just steal again? That‚Äôs silly. I‚Äôm not anti-2nd. I‚Äôm pro-sensible laws and enforcement.
@shanecenters @ginalizbethm @MrDane1982 @SenKamalaHarris Me too!
@AdamPiersen Like I said in the 2nd half of my statement - current laws need to be upheld. That didn‚Äôt happen here. The loophole would be that the law only would have made him give the guns to someone else with a valid license who could just give them right back to him after an inspection.

@ronikpe @DrLeanaWen Agreed.
@ronikpe @DrLeanaWen We also have historic numbers of women of color and white women in our legislative seats, so that should help. And increased numbers of POC and white women medical doctors, which could help with bias.
@ronikpe @DrLeanaWen It‚Äôs being addressed, but slowly and not nearly to the extent needed. When you have a problem based in systemic racism, the best cure is the most difficult - end systemic racism. But universal healthcare is closer than it‚Äôs ever been, so that might help.

@NocturnaGermani @vanillawinnie Do you truly think that you deserve my time after you have insulted me and called me names throughout this thread?
@NocturnaGermani @vanillawinnie The only thing that I said that to was you asking me to take the time to teach you human biology. And I stand by my refusal to take that time for you. I encourage all women to refuse to give out free education to people who are insulting other women.
@NocturnaGermani @vanillawinnie Like I said, I‚Äôm not arguing or trying to form an argument. The only reason I respond to people like you is so that women and girls who happen upon the thread won‚Äôt think that your opinion is the dominant or correct one.
@NocturnaGermani @vanillawinnie It‚Äôs not an argument. It‚Äôs just how I choose to not spend my time. You don‚Äôt seem like someone who is open to education, so I won‚Äôt spend the time on you.
@NocturnaGermani @vanillawinnie You‚Äôll have to pay for it like all the other students I teach. No free science education to the annoying. But google is super helpful in these situations. And if you ever get serious about learning and not just trolling, feel free to tweet back to me.
@NocturnaGermani @vanillawinnie Yes.
@NocturnaGermani @vanillawinnie Super edgy. I could cut through leather with all this edge.
@NocturnaGermani @vanillawinnie Please, tell me more. You sound super smart about science stuff.
@NocturnaGermani @vanillawinnie I‚Äôll tell you what, no fetus has exited a woman and left her body in better condition than it found it. But yes, that‚Äôs how humans pass on their genes. For now...
@vanillawinnie New nicknames??
@NocturnaGermani @vanillawinnie True story, though... I don‚Äôt believe in fetus ghosts. I was just trying to help you come to terms with abortion on your own level. Failed I guess.
@NocturnaGermani @vanillawinnie Oh so your funny sky ghosts are ok, but my aborted fetus ghosts are a problem...? Typical...
@NocturnaGermani @vanillawinnie What went wrong.... I got an education that resulted in a PhD in Microbiology. It‚Äôs been very difficult to survive the hardship of using my brain.
@NocturnaGermani @vanillawinnie How do you know? Are you the all seeing eye that knows exactly what aborted fetuses get up to post-abortion? Maybe fetus ghosts are what make the world go round... or something...
@NocturnaGermani @vanillawinnie It uses the hosts metabolism and immune system... maybe a quick thumb through a biology textbook
@NocturnaGermani @vanillawinnie I don‚Äôt know of very many births that haven‚Äôt eventually led to death... death shouldn‚Äôt be the enemy. If you‚Äôre basing this on some sort of warped Christian idea, you should be happy that the fetus got to go straight to your heaven or whatever.
@NocturnaGermani @vanillawinnie Side note - a fetus doesn‚Äôt really qualify as a life by definition, so it‚Äôs not really taking a life. It‚Äôs more like ending a biological process. A biological process that causes a great deal of physical injury and relatively frequently can cause death.
@JewelLipps incarceration of POC. That‚Äôs extremely important to me. Her decisions while doing her job may not be reflective of how she really feels about an issue. We often have our hands tied. She‚Äôs already started to defend her record in some areas and move forward in others. 2/2

@KCGrond I think it can be fine. Two of the grad students that started in my PhD lab after me went pretty much straight (one post-bac‚Äôd with us for a year) and they‚Äôre both amazing scientists. Both did research during undergrad and were really well prepared.

@AllisonKerwin @McDanielCollege Congratulations!!
@htown_Joe @ChelseaClinton @jonathanchait I think what's happened here is you have been called out on your blatant misogyny in a public sphere and rather than learn from it and move on, you've decided to dig in. There's nothing more I can add here because you need to reconcile that with yourself.
@htown_Joe @ChelseaClinton @jonathanchait Her experience makes her an expert in what constitutes bullying. You have no idea how that joke might have effected her or how it may effect the current White House kid. She does have a very strong idea about that.
@htown_Joe @ChelseaClinton @jonathanchait I've addressed my lack of an opinion on this matter twice and I'm not doing it again. Go reread the tweets for answers to your questions because I already answered them. And that is all from me unless you come up with something original.
@htown_Joe @ChelseaClinton @jonathanchait I explained in each response to a tweet what was problematic about it.
@htown_Joe @ChelseaClinton @jonathanchait A simple disagreement would not, but your increasingly aggressive responses are and your very obvious, well-researched argument tactics are also evidence to sexism/misogyny. I'd encourage you to spend some time reading up on the topic.
@htown_Joe @ChelseaClinton @jonathanchait And again, I am not stating my opinion on the matter and I haven't done that at all. I have stated that I trust the person with experience to know best on the subject matter.
@htown_Joe @ChelseaClinton @jonathanchait *averse
@htown_Joe @ChelseaClinton @jonathanchait And you outright stated they're opinions. Chelsea Clinton, on the other hand, has had the first person experience and decades of additional experience working with other White House kids, as well as bullying itself. Why are you so adverse to trusting her experience? 2/2
@htown_Joe @ChelseaClinton @jonathanchait I am. Your tweets are the evidence. You are continuing to argue that your opinion is more valuable than the experiences of someone else. That is almost never true. You haven't given statistics on bullying or any evidence in defense of your comments. 1/2
@htown_Joe @ChelseaClinton @jonathanchait Pointing out your behaviors is not the same as an insult. And yes, as a scientist I'm pretty straight forward in my comments when issues arise.
@htown_Joe @ChelseaClinton @jonathanchait Telling a woman to just shut up if she doesn't want to get harassed and talked down to. That's rich and not sexist at all.

@htown_Joe @ChelseaClinton @jonathanchait But listening to those who actually experienced it and have knowledge of the downstream effects makes sense. You are sitting here trying to tell the woman who understands White House kid bullying that she doesn‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs talking about.
@htown_Joe @ChelseaClinton @jonathanchait The comments not being exactly the same doesn‚Äôt make one worse than the other. One could make the argument that the global platform we‚Äôre now using will amplify the harmful effects. And to demand one comment was more hurtful than another without being either person is ignorant.

@tucsontwitchy @JoeyKillahhh @KiloMick @Alyssa_Milano Tom, you've got to reply to your reply when you post in threads. I can't reply to each individual comment. I have responses to most of what you posted, but I'm honestly not interested in taking on the emotional labor when you can easily get clarification on through google -
@ChicagoPhotoSho Sounds like the gop has found the new HRC - start with the destructive misinformation and sexist comments right from the start of her career, so her accomplishments are diminished or unrecognized by the voting public as they build up.
@tucsontwitchy @JoeyKillahhh @KiloMick @Alyssa_Milano Especially after observing their treatment of John McCain. But my interpretation that gender and race are the driving forces holds. Statistically speaking, they are for sure the highest correlating factors.
@tucsontwitchy @JoeyKillahhh @KiloMick @Alyssa_Milano My personal thoughts are that most of the people you listed are completely unqualified. As far as I know, Powell (the one I respect from your list) has never run for any office, so he doesn't qualify for this conversation. I'm honestly not sure the gop would back him.
@tucsontwitchy @MatthewDMorales @jt55493 @Alyssa_Milano The exception being when Dems take liberties when interpreting those facts, of course.
@tucsontwitchy @MatthewDMorales @jt55493 @Alyssa_Milano So... Just an aside. You may disagree ideologically with the Dems, but they haven't made dumb statements like trump or other gop in the sense that they are quoting real science and facts. The quotes from trump et al are the uneducated sort of dumb and completely untrue.
@tucsontwitchy @JoeyKillahhh @KiloMick @Alyssa_Milano ie a lack of support. But your claim is unlikely because of the disparity - women are 23% of gop candidates, but less than 3% of elected. That is a massive disparity that strongly suggests gender is the issue.
@tucsontwitchy @JoeyKillahhh @KiloMick @Alyssa_Milano If that were true, there wouldn't be a blatant difference in genders. If gop women only ran in places where money wasn't needed as much, they would win more frequently in those places. If they are running where money is needed and losing, it suggest money isn't being inputted...

@JoeyKillahhh @KiloMick @tucsontwitchy @Alyssa_Milano And, as an aside, you should check out their podcast, as well as Nate Silver‚Äôs book, The Signal in the Noise. It does a great job of explaining trends and statistics to folks who aren‚Äôt immersed in it.
@JoeyKillahhh @KiloMick @tucsontwitchy @Alyssa_Milano I follow fivethirtyeight and really enjoyed this article when it was published. The second ‚Äúwhy‚Äù is precisely the trend in describing. The headline itself states that the gop isn‚Äôt prioritizing women candidates. This article supports my argument.
@tressiemcphd I feel like the height of the kid isn‚Äôt necessary information. üòï
@JoeyKillahhh @KiloMick @tucsontwitchy @Alyssa_Milano There are also a number of studies that look at which candidates get the most media attention and funding from the party. Those are also showing that the gop neglects women candidates. I‚Äôll let you google that one yourself.
@JoeyKillahhh @KiloMick @tucsontwitchy @Alyssa_Milano The trend is quite clear. The interpretation of the trend is more complicated, but when you consider the numbers - 23% of gop candidates are women, but they make up less than 3% of the elected gop - I think party support must be a leading factor.
@JoeyKillahhh @KiloMick @tucsontwitchy @Alyssa_Milano Here‚Äôs maybe some of the data you‚Äôre looking for regarding the current demographics? https://t.co/w5MixTiJsS
@JoeyKillahhh @KiloMick @tucsontwitchy @Alyssa_Milano https://t.co/RQ93py01i4
@JoeyKillahhh @KiloMick @tucsontwitchy @Alyssa_Milano ‚ÄúDespite white men comprising only 31 percent of the population, 97 percent of all Republican elected officials are white and 76 percent are male. Of all Democratic elected officials, 79 percent are white and 65 percent are male, according to the study.‚Äù
@JoeyKillahhh @KiloMick @tucsontwitchy @Alyssa_Milano The 2018 election was last week, so there‚Äôs no study for this one. But you can use google scholar to examine research conducted on previous elections. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs based on. And, of course, the lack of gop women and POC in elected positions.
@KiloMick @JoeyKillahhh @tucsontwitchy @Alyssa_Milano Google scholar can show you studies that might be more to your liking. There are many and you‚Äôre the best person to do the research to answer your specific question.

@KiloMick @JoeyKillahhh @tucsontwitchy @Alyssa_Milano There have been studies looking into this. Check out this one, but there are quite a few accessible through google scholar. https://t.co/GyqaNxG8sF
@JoeyKillahhh @tucsontwitchy @Alyssa_Milano Here‚Äôs one of many articles looking into this. https://t.co/0cZavDMfO8	You can follow both authors on twitter, too.
@JoeyKillahhh @tucsontwitchy @Alyssa_Milano I disagree. I think with enough numbers, you can see trends in the party. It‚Äôs less likely that every gop woman running is a bad candidate than it is that the gop leadership doesn‚Äôt offer enough support across their women candidates.
@tucsontwitchy @Alyssa_Milano I disagree. My argument is that the gop doesn‚Äôt support those candidates (POC, women, and other marginalized groups) when they do want to run and are most qualified. Plus, the party platform is stacked against those groups, so they don‚Äôt often want to be a part of the party.
@JoeyKillahhh @tucsontwitchy @Alyssa_Milano The question was about the ones who got elected, though. This is just folks who ran. I‚Äôm not arguing no strong women in gop. I‚Äôm arguing little to no support from gop leadership and party members.
@silveroinks @Alyssa_Milano I have no idea how to respond to this. I am rubber and you are glue...?
@KFerrugia @tucsontwitchy @Alyssa_Milano The left goes after character when it‚Äôs relevant. For example, if the candidate is a member of a white nationalist group or banned from a mall for hitting on teenage girls, the left will bring those points up. Do you disagree that pedophilia and racism aren‚Äôt valid traits?
@silveroinks @Alyssa_Milano No one is saying they aren‚Äôt American. The post is pointing out that one group is exclusively one demographic of American, while the other group represents Americans across demographics.

@AN_Goldstein I'm a veteran / scientist and have had comments made about my service, but haven't been exposed to the anti-feminism accusation. I appreciate this thread and can only argue against the idea that military service of women is anti-feminist or makes us complicit.
@dychejs @toroonthemove @siobhanof2016 @AN_Goldstein I'm also having a lot of trouble with this. One reason that war disproportionately harms women is because the military is predominately men. More women serving, especially on the ground, would likely improve the entire system. I'm a veteran and a feminist.

@blksciencechick @choo_ek @Mikel_Jollett Good point. I think it‚Äôs more that people had a sense of shame being overtly racist, so they at least knew it was wrong. But a racist is still a racist. Definitely privilege to see it any other way.

@_Drunkenmunk It‚Äôs hard enough to fight here in the US. Can‚Äôt imagine the added challenges that are faced in Indian politics. But how do we combat the propaganda and convince people of the truth?

@_Drunkenmunk Democracy is definitely not working properly at the moment. It cannot work when it is based on ignorance and lies.
@_Drunkenmunk But is there a law against disruptions of marriage? I worry these people will resort to violence against the bride and groom. It is sad that people can‚Äôt just mind their own business.
