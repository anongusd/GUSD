@ambailcoalition @KamalaHarris @ACLU_SoCal NO ONE is arrested for being poor. They are in jail for allegedly committing a crime. Bondsmen deal with friends and family, not the person in jail. We don't care if the person in jail has one cent or one million dollars. Period. #BailWorks

@votenosb10 @BailBondQueen @hrw @Janefonda @LorenaSGonzalez This has to be killed before it kill people. Literally.

@charliekirk11 @Truthteller1349 The murderous terrorists walked away with SIGNATURE bonds. No accountability. NM bail reform was implemented by their Supreme Court judges with no input from citizens. Bail reform is another scam brought to you by John Arnold, George Soros &amp; the ACLU.
