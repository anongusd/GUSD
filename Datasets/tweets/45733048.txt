#OHMuseumChat - what's one thing you know now that you wish you would have known when you first started applying for Capital Budget funds?

Important to keep in mind when asking for Capital funds - don't forget the match requirement! #OHMuseumChat https://t.co/5LJW2MkCze
Communicate with your elected officials early and often, communicate with your community, communicate the value of your project...I'm seeing a trend here... #OHMuseumChat https://t.co/X51eAnyZUU

@historycaptain @artifiedlady Capital Budget requests are best for larger projects. Have a project that isn't going to come in over the $100K mark? Grant funding/foundation support/fundraising might be the better way to go. #OHMuseumChat

RT @artifiedlady: Q3: What is the process for getting your project in the capital budget? #OHMuseumChat

Great question! Any #museumpros out there want to share their self-care tips? #OHMuseumChat https://t.co/Ci8OeDEN0m
@artifiedlady Having orgs really embrace a healthy work/life balance is important. Especially with non-profit workers, as it's in their nature to give, give, give of themselves. Having leadership value the work/life balance of their team is helpful in keeping burnout at bay #OHMuseumChat
RT @artifiedlady: Q5: What are some ways that we can encourage/ support self-care in our institutions? #OHMuseumChat
RT @ohiolha: @artifiedlady Lots of museum jobs ask people to work unusual schedules (Saturdays, events at all hours, holidays) which can ge…
RT @ohiolha: @artifiedlady Lots of hobbies get expensive, and we know that museum workers aren't always paid well. #OHMuseumChat
@artifiedlady It's hard sometimes to put yourself first, especially for folks who work in our field.I think museum folks have a special do-for-others or for-the-greater-good trait that is hard to turn off. Taking care of yourself almost seems selfish (it's not! You are worth it!) #OHMuseumChat

RT @dan_blakemore: A really good question! #Museums #OHMuseumChat https://t.co/84Sexyb4C4
@artifiedlady This is something small, but I think having ample, comfy seating areas is a huge help to visitors. As someone who likes to take marathon museum visits, museum fatigue is real and it's so wonderful to have a comfy place to rest and still enjoy your museum experience. #OHMuseumChat

@artifiedlady I might have to take a page out of the book of one of my fellow State Museum Association leaders - she has a standing appointment for a massage at least once a month! #OHMuseumChat
RT @artifiedlady: Q2: What forms of self-care do you practice? Why? #OHMuseumChat
RT @artlust: @artifiedlady Rain brings me pure joy. #OHMuseumChat
@artifiedlady You can't fully serve your public/support your mission/be an asset to your organization if you are worn down, burnt out, or feeling like your actions aren't making a difference. #OHMuseumChat
RT @dan_blakemore: Dan Blakemore reporting live from the year-end #fundraising trenches! #ohmuseumchat
@artifiedlady A1. Making sure you see to your own needs! In the non-profit world especially, it is so common for folks to really "give their all" for their organization or the mission. Self-care is like "securing your own oxygen mask before helping others" on an airplane. #OHMuseumChat
RT @artifiedlady: Q1: Self-care can be many things. How would you define self-care? #OHMuseumChat
@artifiedlady We're here and excited for today's #OHMuseumChat! Something that brings me joy - watching other people's faces during a fireworks show. Everyone loves fireworks, and it's so fun to see people of all ages really enjoying themselves.

Have a great meeting with an elected official? Congrats! Be sure to follow up &amp; keep in touch to keep the communication flowing! #SpeakUpOhio
According to info from @AAMers, Americans see museums as one of the most trustworthy sources of objective information. #SpeakUpOhio
Museums and other nonprofit cultural organizations return more than $5 in tax revenues for every $1 they receive in funding from all levels of government. #SpeakUpOhio
#SpeakUpOhio tips from Ohio officials: Tuesdays-Thursdays are tough for legislators to make local event invites (they're working at the statehouse!)
The legislative process takes time, and so does cultivating meaningful relationships with elected officials. Don't give up! #SpeakUpOhio
According to @AAMers, for every direct job at a museum, an additional job is supported elsewhere in the economy. This is higher than many other industries. #SpeakUpOhio
Museums provide many social services, including programs for children on the autism spectrum, English as a second language classes, and programs for older adults with Alzheimer’s or other cognitive impairments. #SpeakUpOhio
#Ohio #museums encourage cultural tourism! Travel-related income taxes have increased by 19% over the last 4 years. #SpeakUpOhio
#DidYouKnow? Academic Museums offer faculty &amp; students research, creative writing, science, math, language &amp; fine art practice. #SpeakUpOhio

Thank you, @AkronArtMuseum for being an awesome host for today's workshop! And, Thank you Ceci and @form_creative for an amazing session today! #emailcommunications https://t.co/vhPXNb8wT6
It's Q&amp;A time here at our #emailcommunications workshop with @form_creative! Have questions for our presenter, Ceci? Let us know and we'll ask for you!
So you sent an email...now what? Here are three segments of follow-ups. #emailcommunications @theformgroup https://t.co/Iwpt2ZIVoB
Segmentation for email communication is important! Not everyone should receive every email you send out. Highly engaged readers can withstand more communications. #emailcommunications
Did you know? If you are a nonprofit, you can get the pro version of Canova for free! Just contact them for more info. #emailcommunications
Newsletters or digests shouldn't have more than four feature stories. (there was a combo of groaning and laughter in the workshop room when Ceci said this...she did say arts organizations aren't the only ones guilty of this, phew!) #emailcommunications @form_creative
RT @OhioArtsCouncil: Just a reminder that the #BlueStarMuseums program is going on now through Labor Day! 51 museums in #Ohio have opened t…
The majority of people won't read every word of your communications. Most employ an "F" reading pattern - Reading the top portion, scanning a bit, reading a little more, and scanning the left side. #emailcommunications @form_creative https://t.co/0pl7K9ru8X
When in doubt, utilize A/B testing and review the results thoroughly to see what works best. #emailcommunications
And, subject lines phrased as a question performed better than statements (just make sure not ALL of your subject lines are questions). Use of personalization also increased unique email open rates by 74%. #emailcommunications @form_creative
Creating a great subject line means thinking about what the email is about, not what the email is called. Subject lines with 50 characters or less receive the most open rates. #emailcommunications @form_creative
Nearly 1/3 of people have stopped doing business with companies that engage in poor email practices! Here are 5 overall best practices. #emailcommunications https://t.co/0nIp5ggfmk
But, email still has the highest ROI of all digital communication. #emailcommunications
Did you know? The average time spent reading an email is 11.1 seconds. That's a small amount of time to catch someone's attention! Subject lines are key to get readers to open your email. #emailcommunications @form_creative
According to a recent data study, the #1 motivator to attend an arts and culture event is, "to have fun!" #emailcommunications @form_creative
Find your current patrons to find out how to better communicate with them. Great free tools that are available to get you started: Facebook insights, Google analytics (make sure you have your demographics in!) #emailcommunications @form_creative
There is no one-size-fits-all marketing. All communications (email, social media, web, print) has to work together in the same bubble. #emailcommunications @form_creative
"Relevance drives response. Response drives revenue." - Lee Gallagher. #emailcommunication @form_creative

Thank you to Max at the @cantonmuseum  for talking with me today about the exciting new programs &amp; exhibits coming up at the museum!

@smithsonian has a fantastic guide for accessible exhibition design - check out the full resource at: https://t.co/lwWgXUWc4c #Accessibility
It's Q&amp;A time! Do you have questions for our #accessibility speakers, Erin Hoppe or Derek Mortland? Tweet us and let us know!
Access is a strategic initiative, just like every other strategic initiative. You want to evaluate it, and learn from your evaluations and experiences. - Erin Hoppe, @vsaohio #accessibility
Working on #accessibility issues at your museum? Be sure to include voices from the disability community! "True inclusion will happen when people with disabilities have a prominent seat at the table." (From @Variety)
Erin Hoppe from @vsaohio talking with #accessibility workshop participants about representation and authenticity around disability in our collections and interpretation. https://t.co/wGUJ3i26t8
Derek Mortland from the Center of Disability Empowerment talking about the components of access to a full house at the OMA and @vsaohio #accessibility workshop. https://t.co/RXJrMw9Z5S
Derek Mortland - "You don't have to know everything about #accessibility to make changes and be more accessible at your organization, you just need to know where to look." (@vsaohio, the Center for Disability Empowerment, @adagreatlakes are fantastic resources!)
Knowing about something and understanding/experiencing something are different things. Knowing can be "parroted," but understanding provides ability to chance a circumstance. Knowing &amp; understanding #accessibility works the same way. - Derek Mortland, #ctrfordisabilityempowerment

Access is broad, but access progress! Any steps you can take to make your museum/events/etc more accessible are positive steps forward. #accessibility
Always make Access an agenda item - and always make Access a budget item. When planning events, thinking about your museum space, writing a grant, etc., keep access front of mind by putting it right on the agenda. #accessibility
Looking for a great resource for appropriate and accurate language to use when writing or talking about people living with disabilities? @NCDJ_ASU has a fantastic style-guide! https://t.co/5a4fEekK4r #accessibility
From that same @vsaohio study - the top three reasons access is not a part of daily operations? 1. Lack of funding; 2. Lack of time; 3. It doesn't fit into anyone's job description. #accessibility
According to a recent study by @vsaohio, the top three reasons to pursue access and inclusion efforts include 1. It's the right thing to do; 2. To support a welcoming environment; 3. To include all audiences. #accessibility

RT @artifiedlady: Q2: How do non-conventional spaces broaden your reach? #OHMuseumChat
@ohiolha I think one of the biggest questions is probably addressing the needs of any artifacts/objects/pieces of art. Are there concerns about humidity in a non-conventional space? Light exposure? Moisture? Critters/Insects? Security? How have those been addressed?#OHMuseumChat

@artifiedlady A3. As an introvert, it can be difficult and exhausting to "put yourself out there" during networking events. In a room of people you don't know yet, find someone you have some sort of connection with. Name tag info can be great for this! #OHMuseumChat

@artifiedlady A2. Making yourself open to opportunities &amp; the idea that the path to your desired career isn't always a straight line. Learning to seek unconventional ways to get your foot in the door of what you really want to do, even if that first step is far from the end goal. #OHMuseumChat

#Sponsorship is an important topic for many museums! We'll have more resources and a #storify on the OMA blog soon! #OHMuseumChat
@ohiolha Also important to be sensitive to subject matter - hedge fund manager probably not a good choice for exhibit on housing bubble #OHMuseumChat
@ohiolha ...Make sure you know their expectations and try to minimize how much their sponsorships overlap. #OHMuseumChat

In-kind partner/sponsorships are awesome - a win-win for both your org. and the sponsor! #OHMuseumChat https://t.co/3B9BIXavLV
@ohiolha @massmu Also, look for potential sponsors based on event subject matter. Have an exhibit on history of electricity? Try the power co. #OHMuseumChat
@ohiolha @massmu Look in your community - who has been supportive in the past? Vendors you use regularly, businesses with philanthropic arms... #OHMuseumChat

RT @artifiedlady: Q2: How do you determine what the market can bear when setting your sponsorship levels? #OHMuseumChat
@artifiedlady We have found that companies outside of the museum field are much more responsive to the sponsorship packages (continued) #OHMuseumChat
@artifiedlady This change gave our sponsors more flexibility to choose a level that works best for them, rather than piecemealing benefits. #OHMuseumChat
