@JimCarrey many of the Republican senators gave reason for a woman to not want to come forward. It was amazing how well Dr Ford did under the circumstances she was under yesterday ! Many of the men on the GOP Judiciary Committee did not get it &amp; have no interest in doing so. Thank you!
@kristienoonan @billmaher @HBO Oh yes!!!!!
@amyklobuchar @CBSThisMorning Talk about how sexual abuse victims can come out years later! We are not disputing his excellent record over the years. He is a control freak. When he is in control he is fine. When he loses control is when people are in trouble. Alcohol makes it worse. We saw evidence yesterday
@TXRandy14 the question is about Kananaugh. Not the democrats. Did he commit perjury and does he have the ability to perform a Supreme Judge‚Äôs job? His temperament was certainly questionable and never would be straight about alcohol and his behavior.

@SenatorTomUdall What can we do? can we do anything?
