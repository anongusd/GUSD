@Justinredalen Roe doesn’t specify who can perform abortions and massive studies have concluded no higher risk of bad outcome if a PA or other medical professional performs most abortion procedures.

Like..... what ???
“If I had not become president in my opinion we would be at war with North Korea” is like if i told my boyfriend that if he hadn’t met me in my opinion he’d be a paraplegic
This bit on abortion is pure garbage. State laws that protect Roe v Wade only serve to reinforce existing federal law on a state level. There’s nothing new being allowed. It’s the same thing that’s been legal nationally since 1973. 		&amp; “Late term abortion” isn’t a medical term.

If you're interested in donating to mental health/support organizations that serve the generally underserved part of the country where Jayme Closs lives-- https://t.co/la94NjHUOz and https://t.co/33YHqlQtiH are a couple that come highly recommended.
Small communities are ill-equipped to handle stuff like this. Because it happens so rarely. Not sure if these thoughts make sense but: hope Jayme is okay, and people who can help her live a normal life don't forget about her.
Miranda was abducted in 1992, from near where I grew up and not far from where Jayme was abducted. She was found in a ditch, almost beaten to death. When she recovered, she didn't remember the attack. They never figured out who did that to her. https://t.co/5xcP6xqWVX
girls in remote parts of the country who have bad things happen to them often fall through the cracks, or lack access to services they need. it sounds obvious, but it happens all the time. I think often of the story of Miranda Paffel (cont'd)

I feel the same about gyms offering dog running programs where outside runners can take a few hours' training and get discounts on gym memberships by taking high-energy shelter dogs out for city or trail runs.

Maybe raccoons will do a better job. A raccoon President would have done a better job negotiating with North Korea. A team of raccoons could have at least qualified for the World Cup. A raccoon could run a movie studio or chain of casinos without raping anybody
As a metaphor the raccoon climbing MPR’s building is inspiring but in order to find inspiration we have to overlook the reality that trash-eating forest rodents with opposable thumbs and needle sharp teeth can climb to the top of buildings now. Man’s doom has a puffy tail.

If journalists cut off tv interviews as soon as a subject falls back on the “look:” tic it would be not only very amusing to me but also probably better for tv news. At least until they invented a new “look:”
