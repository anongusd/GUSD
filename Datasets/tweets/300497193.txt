Collins now charging that Dr. Ford was essentially forced into public testimony
“Christine Ford never sought the spotlight,” Collins said….”She seemed completely unaware of Chairman Grassley’s offer” to allow her testify confidentially.
“The allegations fail to meet the more likely than not standard,” Collins said, saying the charges could not “fairly prevent” Kavanaugh from serving on the court
“This is not a criminal trial,” Collins said….”nevertheless, fairness would dictate” the claims should meet the threshold of “more likely than not”
Collins also questions Dr. Ford’s account that she could not remember how she got home that night
Yet, Collins said, there was no corroboration of Dr. Ford’s allegations
Collins said she found Dr Ford’s testimony “to be sincere, painful and compelling” and a survivor of a sexual assault
