@DShoemakerGJPD @gabyreport The important thing is a good base in trust and respect before tragic events happen on both ends- so the media folks can have confidence they will receive the info they need to do the job and the agency has the trust in knowing they can rely on them to do the right thing.

GLENWOOD CANYON ROCKSLIDE DETOUR: This detour adds 146 miles and about three hours to a regular trip from Wolcott to Rifle on I-70, which is usually 67 miles or about 45 minutes- via @CSP_Eagle https://t.co/dDe2bsrutd
@TakLandrock It’s a hard four hours on two lane roads
@DanSpomer Independence Pass is formally closed, Cottonwood is a local road and not safe in the winter.

It’s the way he did have to grow up in a big family with little money coming in. I’m so blessed to have learned how to stretch a paycheck, how to be responsible with my money and yes- to use the resources I’m blessed with until they have holes in the heels. Point of pride.
Those skills are ones it seems a lot of my peers don’t have. My Dad made us kids do this. He also encouraged us to shop the sales racks/ with out budget for school cloths- we had to learn to be smart shoppers. He didn’t do this because we couldn’t afford to, but because
But when I think about it more, his frugal ways have helped shape the way I look at the world. And for this I’m grateful. Let me explain: When I was 10 years old, I was allowed to open my very own checking account. I had to learn to balance the checkbook, and keep receipts.
Is your dad like mine? 	This morning he proudly showed off -while we were FaceTiming-  a pair of socks he claims he purchased in 1983ish. He still wears them.

As a person who watches a family member suffer everyday from the stigma surrounding her mental illness diagnosis, the word “crazy” is offensive and is thrown around like it doesn’t matter. It’s not okay. It hurts. We deserve better. #MentalHealthAwareness #MentalHealthMatters https://t.co/KuIrIhZAaC
I also posted this over on my Facebook and a follower there shared this nice little antidote about my dad... 😚 https://t.co/Pu7cUEoTrS

@ChelseaHelms1 @CBSDenver Received the same press release- I’d bet a few calls to wild horse advocate folks would paint a more complete picture ~ they generally completely disagree w/ @BLM_CO handling of #wildhorses I attended roundups before-They argue the horses aren’t the problem- commercial grazing is
@MarkEFleetwood @CBSDenver Depends who you ask. I do know the vast majority of these horses are never actually adopted, they are housed in massive corrals.
They better brace themselves for the backlash- the Wild Horse advocates are feisty and will fight this plan to the bitter end. Very controversial. We will keep following this for you. @CBSDenver https://t.co/hyZVgcOBO9
