@IngrahamAngle Lmao so you needed a safe space? #snowflake you say the left is intolerant and snowflakes but obama attended and took the jokes which is all they are with grace... if you’re that offended by jokes I got a place for you... it’s called college campuses the place you “hate” so much.

@comics_vault Again that’s her husband not her that would be like blaming Hillary for Bills Infidelities we all know that would be dumb... and her opinion on the victims of the hurricane I’m not even sure what that quote meant but everybody has dumb/ignorant beliefs it doesn’t define a person.
@RonPlacone @Pauldog72 When did Barbra bush start an illegal war? Her son did that a decade after his mother and father left the White House... if you wanna hate the bush family I’m with you I don’t like the Bush’s politics but Barbara Bush was a good lady same with Laura bush they aren’t political...
@funder Good on Ted for calling him a BS artist the his face and he’s bad for the country to his FACE!
@RonPlacone Way over the line to joke about her death even if she’s a bush... morally bankrupt joke imo... she was still a sweet lady with only good intentions from what I could see you can’t blame her for her family’s record
@StephenAtHome @Comey As much as I don’t like Hillary I don’t think her critics at least from the left are sexist they just don’t like the corruption I would’ve voted for her over the monster but my vote in NY would’ve mattered little she’s entitled to speak about politics still but at the Dems cost..

@MotorCityLib @WhereLifego3s @rickyofkokiri @BerniedOut @neeratanden I didn’t vote for trump I’m not gonna blame myself and I just said 12% voted for trump... are you positive 100% of Hillary voters would’ve voted for Bernie? Don’t pretend like everybody has to vote for one candidate it’s called democracy
@MotorCityLib @WhereLifego3s @rickyofkokiri @BerniedOut @neeratanden You are a clown because only 12% of Bernie voters voted for trump and it was only in spite of Hillary... you know what percentage of obama voters voted for Trump? 25% double the rate Bernie voters did... but I’m sure their just racist Nazis🙄 btw I’m gay I’m no Nazi or racist.
@MotorCityLib @WhereLifego3s @rickyofkokiri @BerniedOut @neeratanden Whatever you say clown
@MotorCityLib @WhereLifego3s @rickyofkokiri @BerniedOut @neeratanden Actually he explained exactly how he’d get his policies in place so check your “facts” and how do you “indirectly” vote for someone? You either do or do not vote for a person I would’ve voted for Hillary because she isn’t as bad as trump that doesn’t mean I have to love her...
@MotorCityLib @WhereLifego3s @rickyofkokiri @BerniedOut @neeratanden I’m not in the Trump coalition all you hill bots do is smear cuz you and your ideas SUCK...Im nowhere near a trump fan so piss of with the dumb conclusions have fun continuing to lose
@benshapiro That’s preciously why you being butt hurt you were bullied in high school and subsequently hating poor people for it doesn’t make them criminal savages etc.
@WhereLifego3s @MotorCityLib @rickyofkokiri @BerniedOut @neeratanden There’s no reasoning with people who are to blinded to see nobody likes Hillary and all her corrupt friends they will eventually learn when Trump and other idiots keeping destroying them
@therealroseanne Tim Kaine? Lmao how so?
@justicedems Some aren’t corporate maybe just trying to be pragmatic but subsequently being weak
@stevenoh88 @justicedems @cenkuygur That’s very well and we all know Cenk isn’t like that today he’s a very great guy and a progressive fighter. Him stepping down from Justice Dems was the right decision. Keep fighting Cenk and god bless

@AnnCoulter Repubs go back on their word all the time Moore lost too bad so sad Franken can stay now
@AnnCoulter Ur a clown Ann...
@MooreSenate Ur fucked Roy he’s creeping up on you like you did to those little girls pervert
A lady when asked about the accusations against Roy Moore said “I haven’t seen it with my own eyes...I don’t believe anything till I’ve seen it with my own 2 eyes” after she advocated support for Moore because he’s a “good Christian” anyone see the logical flaw in that?
@SenGillibrand I have my disagreements with you but you are my senator as a New Yorker and I’m proud to have you in office and for the POTUS to say things that demeaning and misleading is horrendous #Whataclown
@realDonaldTrump He’s weak on crime yet he prosecuted white KKK terrorists what have YOU done to stop crime!? Doug Jones will in realty vote with you 50% of the time so calling him a liberal is untrue... Trump says VOTE PEDOPHILE ROY MOORE! Let’s do it!
@MooreSenate I agree! Let’s make it safer by keeping you away from young girls and out of the U.S. Senate
@KyleKulinski FDR was in a wheelchair? So fucking what if he is? lol these people are stupid and out of touch
@iReIateLife @ScienceAndJokes I have only rifles though
@realDonaldTrump @daveweigel He’s a bs reporter he should’ve been fired a long time ago
@DonaldJTrumpJr News you disagree with doesn’t =fake news that’s what 2 year olds think. Grow up. Baby. Sad.
@MooreSenate Give it a rest we know trump likes you and that you like little girls Jesus Christ just stfu about his quotes already jezz
@DonaldJTrumpJr @CNN You’ve got to be the most pathetic and loathsome 1st son this country has ever had
@YesTrumpsRacist @UltimateLiberty @CityOnThePill @bigpodesta @Cernovich Not triggered just exhausted from stupidity from people/trolls like you... that funniest thing is I just handed you your own ass and that tweeted but you’re so oblivious and stupid you didn’t even notice #pathetic #sad #clown

I thought god didn’t make accidents?🤔 Gods gonna kick you down to hell when you die hopefully soon for your families sake and for humanity #clown byeee
@starknightz @SERD1983 @Cernovich Idiots like you already have that’s ok I won’t back down be you and all the other hypocrites are devoid of any morals as you preach Christian values so kindly fuck off bigot
@bigpodesta @Cernovich No... they disarmed him by stripping him of the power he thought he had... @Cernovich is a #clown and his attempt to get Sam fired was a #EpicFail he already told CNN he was “emboldened” and planned to get others fired from MSNBC so much for that lol #Toobadsosad
@AnnCoulter A photo that proves he took a picture with a girl and pretended to grab a girls breasts that doesn’t mean he raped them/assaulted them...
@AnnCoulter You are bashing Franken for not apologizing as he RESIGNS but you still support Roy Moore? #Hypocrisy
@SERD1983 @Cernovich @starknightz Really Christian of you to vote for a pedophile
@Cernovich That’s right mike you aren’t political at all.. you just get people fired for jokes after crusading against political correctness and anti-free speech leftists... what happened to YOUR “principles”? #cernovichtheclown
Epic fail for @Cernovich  for thinking he had any real influence....what a clown... Im enjoying this very much #schadenfreude #whataclown please make a video on this @cenkuygur @KyleKulinski https://t.co/wHsOKHh69b
@Scribbles646 @GovJVentura @Brigida__Santos Laws against murder and fraud is also “regulations” are you against those too?
@Scribbles646 @GovJVentura @Brigida__Santos What are you talking about? it’s regulations that maintain a free and open internet... net neutrality is like the constitution of the internet that puts restrictions on ISP from doing things to benefits them and control it? Be a little more nuanced then just “me hate regulation”
@GovJVentura @Brigida__Santos Strongly against... I’m sure you are as well Jesse since you’re a smart guy
@Cernovich Awe😢 looks like the infinite power and influence you thought you had(at least with MSNBC) was nothing but a facade😢😢😢...😂😂😂 you people crack me up what a clown you are Mike... maybe if you were such a blithering idiot you’d be taken more seriously #snowflke #gianthypocrite
@MooreSenate I love how even in Alabama you are so vile and repugnant that you have to smear your opponent to get elected. Sad!
@Cernovich You may think you have influence because MSNBC fired an unfunny jackass YouTube but that doesn’t mean you can smear people into resigning because in reality you’re just a smear merchant with no power or influence
@Cernovich Trump said he’d be neutral on Israel and Palestine... you made this up. Not surprising from a clown
@Cernovich Yeah because MSNBC likes kissing the asses of alt right cucks like you and mike savage
@ChrisDavisMMJ @MooreSenate That’s ironic since Roy Moore is a vote for trumps agenda and he’s a radical... projection of the highest magnitude... Alabama wants trumps agenda so he’ll win but that’s why Alabama is among the worst states and is a joke economically and culturally good luck same people there..

@AnnCoulter Ann it’s pathetic that the only time you call trump out is when he’s right that makes you the biggest clown of them all... heroin isn’t the bigger problem it’s opioids.
@Williamptx6 She’s a clown pay no mind to her
@AnnCoulter Ann Coulter... that video is fake you twat... and if a movie generalized too much about Christians it should be condemned but you’re the poster child for what’s wrong with Christians especially in America
@GregAngelo81 @AnnCoulter Not an opinion biblical fact...though shalt not curse...and wishing rape upon someone is another level of Christian hypocrisy on Ann’s part...if you don’t like biblical facts then cry about it snowflake✌🏻
@Super_Nebular @pledgeddelegate @Carolin17951107 Fair enough lol same with Reagan
@AnnCoulter Lol nice Christian talk Ann
@Carolin17951107 You hate socialist liberals? That’s antithetical to the teachings of Christ you also hate Christians as well...

@jimmy_dore You're right they wouldn't but there would be a better chance of it passing into law considering trump will veto it...
