@joshuagriffin wowowowow
@PriscillaShirer Love you back Priscilla.
Never let people put you on a pedestal.  A pedestal is a prison. It messes up your mind because humans aren't created to be idolized. Only God deserves worship.
When you  serve with #integrity it gets better every year. If you give up your integrity, ministry gets worse every year.
Today I'm praying for my fellow pastors who happen to be in their 30s. Don't get worn out &amp; discouraged. Pace yourself. Ministry is a marathon Your ministry matters to God and we need you to finish your Race. The reward is SO worth it.
@JJ_Denhollander Just prayed for your family. God is with you Jacob.

People look for #Significance in all the wrong places. Significance doesn't come from #salary or #status or #sex or #success. It comes from #SERVICE! Only in giving yourself away in serving God by serving others will you ever know what it means to REALLY live.
God is not mad at you; He is mad ABOUT you. No man or woman will ever love you like your Creator does. It's the reason you're alive. God IS love, and he made you so he could love you.The only reason you can give &amp; receive love is because He made you in his image.

You start growing the moment you stop making excuses.
Temptation is just a choice, and you can always use that choice for your own good.  Every time you FEEL like doing the wrong thing but CHOOSE to do the right thing, you GROW. It's how you develop spiritual muscle and maturity.
And if anyone says mean things about you, just bless them back. They're revealing THEIR character, not yours.
Don't worry what others are thinking about you because they aren't. They're thinking about themselves too.
When people are in deep pain they don't need explanations, advice, encouragement, or even Scripture. They just need you to show up and shut up. Just be WITH them. It’s the healing ministry of presence. #RealComfort

"We have forgotten God.We've vainly imagined,in the deceitfulness of our hearts,that all these blessings were produced by our superior wisdom and virtue. We've become too self-sufficient to feel the necessity of redeeming grace, too proud to pray...” Lincoln 3/30/1863 https://t.co/WYUaTzu4tu

"Christianity has adjusted itself much too easily to the worship of power." Sadly, Bonhoeffer's words are more true today than when he spoke them 84 yrs ago in a sermon in London on 2 Cor.12:9. Today's idolization of power breaks God's heart.
Congratulations to Rachel &amp; Jacob @R_Denhollander @JJ_Denhollander for being selected in TIME 100 for 2018! I admire your courage. So proud of you! TIME selects too few godly influencers from around the world. Jacob, in 2005, I too worried about spilling! (smile)
What is sin?	SIN is living for yourself.		God made you for far, far more.	"Only those who give away their lives away for my sake and the Good News will ever know what it means to REALLY live." Jesus  (Mark 8:35 LB)	#ItsNotAboutYou https://t.co/wakZAeOf7W
Believers Behaving Badly never invalidates the Gospel. Instead it validates it, because Jesus insisted we all need a Savior because we're all hopelessly broken. I desperately need God's grace. You do too.
Of course we should be concerned about fake news, but the #FakeThinking that we all do is even more debilitating. I wrote about it a decade ago. Reinforcing my biases isn't thinking.
So much conflict and division is caused by #MotivatedReasoning. Everyone, including media, uses #MR without realizing it. We believe what we WANT to believe about someone or something, then look for reasons to back up our prejudiced feelings. It's fake thinking.
600 SoCal pastors joined me today at Saddleback for 3 hrs of praying for each other as we start Holy Week. We focused praying for our families, churches, revival, sermon prep, Easter services, racial reconciliation and much more. A great spirit of unity and worship
You start healing the moment you stop blaming.
Integrity is a habit, not a feeling. 	You speak the truth, keep your promises, and do what's right	 even when it's unpopular or you don't feel like it.
Authenticity never goes out of style. I’m so grateful for REAL pioneers like @AmyGrant @michaelwsmith @StevenCurtis @kirkfranklin @DarleneZschech @officialtobymac and other giants. Still authentic, still serving, still making a difference in this broken world.
A small step of progression is a thousand times better than a delayed step of perfection.  Perfectionism procrastinates and paralyzes progress.
You start healing the moment you stop blaming.

@MichaelLicona That's a power team if there ever was one! Bless you all friends!
It’s always better to comfort someone imperfectly than to say nothing perfectly.
God lets you pick HOW LONG your tough journey to spiritual maturity will take.  The length will depend on 2 things: how quickly you obey him and how deeply you trust him when it doesn't make sense.
There’s no way I can see and correct my own sins and weaknesses, if I’m focused on criticizing yours.  So which do you think God wants us to focus on?
Thanks for this Joe: https://t.co/JuAyGi8tF0  In helping many break free, I’ve seen the longer it goes undetected, the more damage it does.
When you don't feel like praying... you're not praying what you feel! 	Faking kills prayer.	Tell God your true feelings -ALL of them.	You can't be #CloseToGod without being #HonestToGod

A big error young leaders make is thinking leadership is about the leader. It's not about you. It's about serving others.
Standing before God one day, what will matter is whether or not your life was biblically correct, not politically correct.
Every temptation is an offer to doubt God's love and wisdom.

True #faith isn't based on how you feel. In fact, your emotions often hinder your faith.
Faith is only as powerful as what you put it in. There are many things you can put your faith in that can't help you at all.
One reason we have so many problems is because we rarely trust God until we have to.
The more you surrender to God, the more at peace you'll be.The more you trust Him, the less you'll need explanations.
Amen @RichNathan  How important is a leader's prayers? "I shouldnt sin against the Lord by failing to pray for you"1Sam12:23

Most love songs are actually lust songs.
Lust is about satisfaction. Love is sacrificing, serving, surrendering, sharing, supporting, and even suffering for others.
If you risk building bridges of love to reach unbelievers you WILL be walked on! But it'll be by believers who misjudge you
#Psalms has the truth we need for healthy emotions and #Proverbs has the truth we need for healthy relationships.
If depressed, waiting until you FEEL like doing what's right is a huge mistake.You can't trust your feelings when depressed.
We can give by #reason (What can I afford?) OR by #revelation (God,what do u want to give thru me?) The 2nd activates faith.
How those who don't know you judge you isn't important. What IS important is that you always respond in love. #ItsATest
Leaders always start with WHY before modeling HOW. People quit when they forget WHY. Preach WHY and HOW and you get WOW.
I will follow you on LinkedIn if you send me an invitation through LinkedIn.

Being cool has never been a requirement for being happy or effective- in life marriage, work or ministry.Cool is overrated.
Expect the best and plan for the worst. The Wright brothers took extra lumber assuming their first flight would crash.
Anytime you feel jealous or envious, you reject your uniqueness. It's a criticism of God's plan for you.
Vision is the ability to see potential in what others overlook.
The most dangerous temptations, most difficult challenges,and most discouraging attacks come from success, not failure.
All leaders are learners. The moment you stop learning, you stop leading.
Holding on to an offense never hurts your offender. It just lets them keep hurting YOU. That's dumb.

It's no wonder why some believers will bring no one to heaven with them. It's because they're mean to non-believers #unloving
If God was small enough for you to completely understand him, he wouldn't be big enough for you to completely trust him.
You weren't put on earth to live for yourself. You were put on earth to prepare for eternity.

Staying quiet and trusting God to vindicate you when critics attack what God told u to do is a beautiful expression of faith
Anytime you add a new task or event to your life ask "What'll I give up?" Elimination leads to #purposedriven effectiveness
Strength is developed by struggle and suffering, not the success.
Winning acclaim won't make you a better person unless you use it to better serve others. But it harms if you get prideful.

You cannot lead if you only do what others want you to do.
The flaw in the Law was that it cannot save. For that, only a Savior will do.

IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU! RT @tomf80 Just found out my whole congregation can recite the first line of "Purpose Driven Life!
You cant really "sacrifice" for Jesus since he gave his life for you AND you'll benefit from whatever you give up for him.

521 new disciples in the Kingdom thru Sadleback's Easter services. I am addicted to changed lives.It's worth all the pain.
Great pastors know it's more important to pray for your people than preach to them.Preaching without praying is pathetic.
The reason I haven't done interviews in nearly 2 yrs is that reporters are interested in politics & I'm not.
A preacher showing off in the pulpit reveals he isn’t showing up in the prayer closet.
Five times in Scripture St.Paul calls his message "MY gospel." Preaching that isnt personal isnt powerful.
A quick opinion is a poor substitute for serious consideration. Sound bites are often unsound.
You can confine a poet,but not his poetry... arrest a leader,but not his vision... imprison a pastor, but not his message.
Whose cruel idea was it for the word “Lisp” to have an “S” in it?
Value is determined by what someone is willing to pay for it. Jesus' death on the cross shows your worth & value to God.

"If you suffer for doing God's will,just commit to trust your faithful Creator & keep on doing what's right" 1Peter 4:19
God DOESNT help those who help themselves. God HELPS those who admit they're helpless to help themselves!
The better u know yourself; the less prideful you'll be. Honesty creates humility.Self-deception leads to self-destruction.
To think that I know better than God is not just arrogant; it's demonic. See 1 Sam.15:23
History is HIS Story.It is futile to try to understand history's overarching theme & direction without Christ.
Hell is real.Jesus spoke about it more than about heaven & I trust him as the authority on the afterlife, not you nor me.

We want intelligence,God wants obedience.We want confidence,God wants dependence. We want relevance,God wants reverence.
We honor performance,God honors persistence.We honor prominence,God honors allegiance.We honor affluence,God...benevolence.
Both our churches & culture measure & bestow honor on the wrong people for the wrong reasons.
The Church has only ONE celebrity:JESUS!  Some folks seem to have forgotten that.It's not about you.
LOL! Read a conspiracyblog claiming our church diet is a secret databank for the GOVT! I have NO TRUST in govt healthplans!
Be humble or you'll stumble.

Jackie Robinson debuted with the Brooklyn Dodgers today in 1947 shattering the color barrier in pro baseball forever!
A cliche but true: F.E.A.R. is False Evidence Appearing Real.  Fear is always worse than the reality.
There are 365 "FEAR NOT"s in God's Word - one for every day of the year. God is serious about you trusting Him.

It takes NO leadership skills to teach a leadership seminar.Leadershipis isnt saesmanship, but serving others. Mark10:42-44
Books by leadership gurus that teach how to "make it to the TOP" prove they know zero about REAL,leadership! Mark 10:42-44
To impact a moment,tweet.To impact a wk,preach a sermon; Impact a yr, write a book; To impact a generation,mentor a leader.

Eternity is a long time to be wrong.
I believe in the inerrancy of Scripture. I do NOT believe in the inerrancy of my interpretation... nor yours either!
If you could understand why God does all that he does, you'd be God. It's simple: God is God & I'm not!
"As the heavens are higher than the earth,my ways higher than your ways & my thoughts higher than your thoughts" Isaiah55:9
Trying to comprehend all of God's ways is like an ant trying to comprehend the Internet.Our brain capacity isnt big enough.
Pain produces passion which leads to prayer which leads to intimacy with God.
Anything not worth doing, is worth not doing.
O sucesso exige FOCO. Hoje vc terá várias coisas para fazer, mas foque em "Qual a COISA MAIS IMPORTANTE que devo fazer?"
Sometimes your most indispensible work that day is a relationship.
Success requires FOCUS.Today you'll have many important tasks but focus on "What's the ONE INDISPENSIBLE thing I must do?"
Only laundry should ever be separated by color.
Laws limit behavior, but only love liberates the heart. The Gospel turns bigots into brothers & enemies into friends.
The solution to racism & ethnic fears is to come together in Christ, where at the foot of the Cross, the ground is level.
Of course God exists. I just talked with him.

You're never persuasive when you're abrasive. Speak the truth with love.
"A wise, mature person is known for his understanding.The more PLEASANT his words,the more PERSUASIVE he is" Pr16:21 TEV
Don't just share the truth of the Gospel today; share the power of it.
Jesus' frequent "dinners with sinners" irritated religious folk.Imagine how bloggers would attack his friendships today!
Implying guilt by association is SIN: Read ALL of Acts 10:28 "God's shown me I shouldnt call ANY man impure or unclean"

The # of abortions due to health or rape is TINY! But millions are murdered every yr for the sake of CONVENIENCE.  Pr.31:8
Mature leaders celebrate God's blessing on other ministries.Resenting or envying it reveals insecurity & ungratefulness.
Rom12:15 "Rejoice with those who rejoice & weep those who weep" It's easier to commiserate than celebrate because of envy.
Just because a truth... about God,myself,problems,suffering,hell,etc .. is difficult to accept, that doesnt make it untrue!
"A man's wisdom gives him patience; it is to his glory to overlook an offense"  Prov19:11
One potato, two potato, 3 potato, four...means you're not on a low carb diet.
EVERY BELIEVER EVERYWHERE is called to GO. No exceptions. Period. You cannot "follow" Christ without going. It's the Great Commission!
"An unreliable messenger can cause a lot of trouble. RELIABLE COMMUNICATION PERMITS PROGRESS" Prov 13:17 LB
Living for Jesus without Spirit power is like moving a car without gas.You can push it for a while but will quickly tire.
God commands us to "Go to every nation & make disciples" What part of GO do you not understand?
Yes Bob, I tweet in tongues! Spanish,Portuguese,Korean,Japanese & Indonesian. I've never let anyone else tweet for me.
A pastor must never say "I'm not a theologian." EVERY pastor is a theologian.The only debate is whether a good or bad one.
GOD LOL! "The God&Messiah-deniers say 'Let's get free of God' & God enthroned in heaven breaks out laughing!" Ps2:2-4Mes
Nunca dejes que un problema "IMPOSIBLE" te intimide. Dejalo que te MOTIVE-a confiar más, orar más, esperar más de Dios!
Whenever you use the word "impossible" expect laughter from heaven. "With God all things are possible" Mt.19:26
Never let an "impossible" problem intimidate you. Let it  MOTIVATE you - to trust more, pray more, expect more from God..
A big part of being a friend is just showing up. Drove a guy from my small group to hospital. Waiting with him for surgery.
Failure isn’t fatal. It’s failing to learn & change from failure that’s fatal.
A maturidade espiritual está baseada em quão obediente voce é, e não na idade que tem
God put you at your workplace, not to share gossip, but to share the gospel.	Who do you need to talk to?
La Madurez Espiritual esta basada en cuan obediente eres tu, no en la edad que tienes!
Spiritual maturity is based on how obedient you are, not how old you are.
Culture no longer blushes about sin & churches no longer weep about it.
"Freely you have received, so freely give!" Jesus, Matt.10:8
J, every time doubters say“You cant do that!” we just DO it,then we help tens of 1000s of OTHER churches do it too! Mt10:8b

Happiness is the fruit of holiness. "Happy are those who are strong in the Lord" Psalm 84:5 NLT

Stars are the street lights of the universe. "God spoke the stars into existence with his word" Psalm 33:6
'Even when I am afraid, I keep on trusting you" Psalm 56:3
Los grandes predicadores no son grandes por sus habilidades para hablar, sino por la pasión que fluye de sus vidas.
Para liderar crea una cultura positiva, alienta decisiones de riesgo, permite errores, respeta ideas, valora diferencias.
Thank YOU for following! @JohnLitton Rick,u get this 140 character media! You nail it! Greatest posts of all consistently!
It's easier to fighter for truth than live it. It's why there are more Defenders than Disciples.
Dance expresses what the soul senses. "David danced before the Lord with all his might" 2 Sam.6:14
Great preachers arent great because of speaking skills, but because of the passion that flows from their lives.
Movement, not words, reveal what a person thinks & believes.
You cannot lead others until you learn to lead yourself - to do what's right when you dont feel like doing it.
For a world class staff- create a positive culture, encourage risk-taking, allow mistakes, respect ideas, value differences
IF it walks & quacks like a duck, it ... still could be a rabbit, dressed as a duck to fool hunters during rabbit season.
People who live in glass houses… make fascinating neighbors.
You who minister to kids,youth&students are the true change agents of culture.I believe in u! Still adding names to follow
Not only does the Church have a future-the future IS the Church! ONLY it has security 4 eternity! Naysayers are dead wrong
I'm adding you who lead Kids,Jr High,Sr.High&College in your church & follow me. ButTwitter wont let me go back more than 5 hrs for names!
Reject panic with praise. Replace worry with worship.Relieve anxiety with adoration.
If u are leading Kids,Jr High,Sr.High&College in your church & are following me I want to follow you.Will add u tonight.
I'm praying for all Pastors of Students today esp, Jr. High leaders. If ur following me tell me so I can follow u back.
God wired us to have JOY in worship. It's why every culture worships. U WILL worship something! If not God, maybe yourself.

@pastornar @SamYacoub @j_manners  Absolutely. I'm counting on it!
Teaching this weekend? People become what you encourage them to be, not what you nag them to be. Nagging doesnt work.
Don’t worry about doing something great.Do something good & keep doing it. Then God may use you to do the impossible.
To be unique just be yourself - because everyone around you is trying to be someone they aren’t.
When ministry requires you to walk a tightrope, keep your eyes on the horizon, your end goal. Never look down or around.
Today common sense is so uncommon people think it is genius.

Pop culture LEVELS everything & reverences nothing,demeaning real heroes & idolizing vapid celebrities.Then we FALL FOR IT!
Superstar leaders jump at any opportunity to be coached or counseled. It's their secret advantage over average leaders.
Humility is key to understanding what God is really like.Anytime pride enters my thinking,my view of God will be incorrect.

Refusing to learning from others' models is prideful & dumb."God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble" James 4:6
EVERYTHING I know I learned from OTHERS - so I'd be a fool to be prideful about it. Ego forgets it's all by grace.

To live as if nothing matters is boredom. To realize everything matters is to be fully alive. Memorize Eccles.11:9
Don't bite the hand… that looks dirty
People distrust complexity & trust simplicity.Jesus' sermons were simple not shallow.To simplify remove what's unnecessary.

Pastors! Pastors from all 195 nations invite u to join us in our Purpose Driven Pastors Network. PastorRick@saddleback.com
Pastors:Your sermon must always FIRST be your offering to God, Only after that can it become a presentation to others.
Worship isn't an event to attend & watch. It's a lifestyle to be lived.
It's EASY to love people like yourself. But for God to teach u REAL love, He must bring unlovely people into your life.
Today, I'm praying for all Spanish-speaking church leaders If ur following me, tell me,so I can follow u. Gracias!
You can only LEAD what you ARE. Being preceeds doing. Character is the fountain of conduct.
"NOTHING can be hid from God;everything in creation is exposed to his eyes & we must give account of ourselves" Heb.4:13
Pastors:Never say or tweet anything about a fellow minister you’ll regret when Jesus asks WHY you said it one day. Mt.12:36
TALENT without character leads to prideful failure. 2 of my MOST talented staff each lost a ministry due to moral failure.
I dont have to OWN it to ENJOY it.-This simple truth prevents debt, enables savings & avoids the cost of upkeep.

If you prayed instead of worrying, you'd have a lot less to worry about.
Worry is a 100% waste of emotion. It cannot change the past. It will not change the future. It just ruins today.
Most things you do are subject to the law of diminishing returns. An exception is the creation of new ideas.

Success in ANY area starts with being humble enough to seek advice from those who’ve already done it. See Pr.13:10
Tyrants suffocate talent in an office. Trainers liberate it.
Ministry tip:When talking with those who are grieving or in crisis,slow down. Speak slowly.Never imply hurry.Attention=love
Dont kid yourself. You only believe the parts of the Bible you actually follow.

A self-serving leader is a contradiction. Any moment you are serving yourself, you're not a leader. Period.
Any second spent taking potshots at other members of His Kingdom is time I'm not serving the King.
Satan's plan to to keep you in the dark about your significance due to God's Creation & Jesus' Cross.
God has enough gifts for everyone. There are no "no-talent" people.
In the poorest slums on earth I've learned that gangs & violence are not created by poverty but by the absence of fathers.
You don't need other people's permission to be happy. You are as happy as you choose to be.

If  you could see the human suffering I've seen firsthand around the world, I know you'd yearn more for the 2nd Coming too.
To make your fear disappear - just do it!  Never argue with fear.You must MOVE against it, saying I CAN do this!
Fast decisions are often wrong decisions.Clarity is more important than speed.Take the time to think it through in solitude
Leaders do the worst first. Losers do what's easy first.
Churches have vision problems,not money problems.Funds flow to Spirit-inspired ideas. People give to vision, not needs.
If you are a church leader following me, let me know so I can follow you back. Also I pray for other pastors.1 Sam12:23
Real maturity is never the result of a single experience, no matter how powerful or moving. Growth is gradual.
In OUR courts:we're convicted then condemned.In GOD's court: we're convicted but Jesus takes our condemnation.We go free!
It wasn't nails, but love, that held Jesus to the Cross. He nailed down our salvation for eternity.
Growing up with an absentee father can cause u to intellectualize a relationship to God & struggle FEELING his smile.
@pastormarkcox  from one pastor to another, thanks for your distance mentorship & daily truth reminders./WE'RE A TEAM MARK!
EXCUSES:“Yes BUT..” We all have buts! I cant see mine but easily see yours! I always think your but is bigger than mine!
Vivir como Cristo NO es suficiente para ser testigos. Hasta Jesús necesito usar palabras para explicar el Evangelio.
Living like Christ is NOT enough of a witness. Even Jesus had to use words to explain the Good News.
"They defeated Satan by theBLOOD of the Lamb,by the word of their TESTIMONY&were willing to GIVE UP THEIR LIVES"Rev12:11
1 day when we offer our LAME excuses(often theological)for not witnessing,I think Jesus will say"You've GOT to be kidding!"
Is anyone going to be in heaven because of you?
You cannot lead enemies to Christ,only friends.Unless you befriend unbelievers,you'll never take anyone to heaven with you.

Are u WILLING to be judged & even slandered by religious folk in order to build bridges of love to unbelievers? Jesus was!
To be CHRISTLIIKE means religious folks will get upset with you for being "a friend of sinners" But it shows wisdom.Mt11:19
The work you do on earth will fade away but the lives you touch will leave eternal fingerprints.
The most Christlike action you can do is accept suffering from enemies in order to benefit those enemies.See Luke 6:27

Real faith is enduring faith. Fake faith withers in tough times.
TODAY:A church press release ANNOUNCES it will NOT be "sensitive to seekers" So they'll be insensitive to the lost? Mark2:17
Worry is practical atheism.It says u dont really believe your loving Heavenly Father will keep his promises to care for you

Self-centered living is so common.The only truly RADICAL lifestyle is obeying God in faith, even when it doesnt make sense.

El materialismo es comprar cosas que no necesitas cn dinero que no tienes p impresionar a gente que ni siquiera te cae bien
Old & young guitarists respect each other 's talent & JAM TOGETHER to make great music. A model for pastors of all ages.
Materialism is buying things you dont need, with money you dont have, to impress people you dont even like.
In the face of evil bystanders are no better than perpetrators.
An embellishment is just a lie in a tuxedo.

Antidote to stress: Say aloud "God is God, and I'm not!" Repeat 5 times.
If you fear you're losing your mind & going crazy- relax; you aren't. Truly crazy people don't worry about it.
Half the world lives on less than $2 a day. One billion people live on less than $1 a day!  Are you OK with that?
Surrendering to Jesus you give up everything & then you've never had it so good.
When u have God’s FAVOR, attacks just increase your success “The more they were afflicted, the more they multiplied&grew” Ex1
When you let go of a hurt, you liberate yourself.

What matters is not the attack but how you react.
Overreacting to a short-term problem with a long-term decision leads to regret. Calm down.

Free gift is redundant.
People frantic to change the world can be using a Noble Cause to deflect personal pain & ignore where they need to change
If u want to change the world,1st ask WHY? What am I running? It’s easier to change others than to let Jesus change me.
The conflict inside us causes conflict around us. See James 4:1
Ministry must be "wholistic" since each of us have a "whole list" of sins & problems we need help with.
Healthy, growing organizations value staff more for their knowledge and results than by how well they follow proceedures.

It is offensive to God when I claim to believe in grace while being ungracious to others.
Believing the doctrines of grace doesnt make u gracious! You must EXPERIENCE grace to be transformed into a gracious person
The more aware u are of your own sinfulness,the more gracious u are to others.Judging others reveals self-righteousness.
Omit needless words.The tighter the truth,the more pointed the impact.

Your mind is at war with God wanting to BE god. But no way will you win that war.Giving in to His pure love brings peace
To be filled with the Spirit of Christ is to be filled with love for everyone.
When people react to believers they dont even know, that reaction is really about the struggle going on within themselves.
Maturity ISNT measured by how high u raise your hands when u FEEL God, but by how straight u walk in obedience when u dont.

Theology should determine your morality,not vice-versa. If u get it backwards you create a false God who excuses your sin.

If you secretly feel your current ministry is too small for you, it only shows that you are too small for that ministry.
Many give up everying to go into full-time ministry-except themselves.The unsurrendered self is the last thing we give up.
Be more interested in where people are headed rather than where they've been.
Sadly many churches are willing to let people perish if their particular worship style or denomination can't reach them.

"In the world,leaders do power plays over others.But your leadership is to be different.U r2 lead by being a servant” Jesus
It's easy to lead if u can pay & fire people.Real leaders can lead VOLUNTEERS to serve & sacrifice. Pastors do that daily.
Seminars overvalue what business leaders can teach pastors & undervalue what pastors could teach business about leadership
Seeing the situation from God's perspective is a distinguishing mark of godly leadership in contrast to worldly leadership

Often the best way to show love is with your eyes & ears. Everyone is starving for attention & understanding.

Services full of unbelievers is an evangelism win. Small groups full of radical believers is a discipleship win. Acts5:42
My sinful biases & failure to recognize how LITTLE I really know is a huge barrier to God's greater blessing&use of my life
God never blesses Know-it-Alls.He uses & blesses the humble because they're teachable & learn from everyone.Ps25:9 Prov3:34
It takes at least a decade of real ministry for God to rid us of the arrogance we develop in college & seminary.
Whenever God gives you a check in your gut,stop IMMEDIATELY! Dont just slow down, STOP & LISTEN! It's saved me many times.
Ps.46:10 "Be still and know that I am God" means sit down & shut up. You cant hear God if you're never quiet.
Wearing a mask wears you out.Faking it is fatiguing.The most exhausting activity is pretending to be what you know u arent.
If u want your life to count, u must get with people using their lives to make a difference & stop hanging with complainers

People gather in EMOTIONAL CLUSTERS on social networks. Angry people attract each other.The happy hang out together. etc
The gospel of wealth is the polar opposite of the wealth of the Gospel.
Be careful in using the phrase "God & Country." Some may conclude they're equal in importance. That's idolatry.

What we think is a deadend is often God's detour to a better way.
For Kay & me,our best way to pray together is conversationally,back & forth aloud, rather than 2 uninterrupted prayers.
The most common way Jesus comes into our lives is through a broken heart.
Mk 14:3“She broke an alabaster jar & poured the perfume on Jesus” When our hard hearts are broken the atmosphere is sweeter
Prayer is dialog, not mere monolog. 50% is quiet listening.
Prayer isn't convincing God to do our will but alligning ourselves with His will, which requires overcoming evil with good.
Kay& I are spending today in prayer together. Just tweeting thoughts between our prayer times.
Neither the length nor eloquence of your prayers causes God to answer.God responds to faith.See Mark 11:24
It's dumb not to learn from others because u disagree with much of what they say.Even a broken clock is correct twice a day

An unhealthy climate on a church staff is likely caused by being afraid to say the last 10%of difficult truth to each other
Some think u discover your ministry by identifying your gifts- but actually u discover your gifts by serving in ministry.
Volunteers who retire after YRS of service in children or student ministry shouldnt be criticized but enshrined as heroes!
I often find that my attitude, like a diaper, requires changing or I stink up the place.
God isn't impressed that you believe in grace but he smiles when you're gracious.
God lets you choose whether you'll be arrogant or annointed but you can't be both.
Hadnt checked DirectMessages lately. Found 840 from our network.Sorry guys! I cant keep up.Thanks for your notes.I LOVE U PASTORS!
Love this paraphrase: "God rewrote the text of my life when I opened the book of my heart to his eyes"  2 Sam 22:25 Mes
RT @TommyTenney "Cheap men are like cheap mascara. Both run when women cry," Ha!
With God, there are no hopeless situations- only people who've given up hope. "I will always have hope" Ps 71:14
It's far easier for me to judge others than love them.But loving pleases God while judging others ticks off God. James4:12
If God wasn't forgiving, heaven would be empty of people.
Caution for tweeters&bloggers:"You will give an account on judgment day of every careless word you've spoken"-Jesus Mt12:36
GRACE is the fact that God already knows every sin & stupid mistake I'll make yet choses to save, bless, & use me.Rom 11:6
If u cant-or are afraid to-challenge others by YOUR example ur NOT a leader! 1 Cor11:1,4:16, 1Th1:6,2:14, Ph3:17, 2Th3:9
Imitation beats innovation IF you choose the right model/mentor. Jn 13:15,1Cor11:1,4:16,1Th1:6,2:14,Ph3:17,2Th3:9
Faith isnt denial but facing facts w/o being discouraged.CANCER:u CANT DENY the diagnosis but u CAN DEFY the verdict.Fight!
If your dream to marry/have kids is stymied,REDIRECT BLOCKED LOVE! Millions need your love! Orphans,the Sick,the Unloved...
Jesus said pray "THY WILL be done on earth as it is in heaven" because it is done PERFECTLY in heaven but RARELY on earth.
What's BornAgain? Admission of need,Submission to God,Remission of sin&guilt,Transmission of life,Commission for service
No one could have ever found God. He had to reveal himself -coming where we are & loving us as we are in order to save us.
@johnsiebeling reports their Memphis church saw 759 people commit their lives to Jesus for salvation in August alone! Yeah!
Sometimes I see life so clearly...but then I wake up. "Help me Lord! My thoughts are restless & I'm confused" Ps.55:2
It’s the broken wagon wheel that squeaks.Complaining & criticizing just publicizes our brokenness & immaturity to others.
If you spent as much as time praying as you do complaining, you'd have a lot less to complain about.
"Do everything cheerfully without complaining.. be a breath of fresh air in this polluted society" Phil.2:14-15 Mes
A cranky,critical,combative Christian is a terrible witness to our gracious God. "ABOVE ALL,love each other deeply" 1Pet4:8
“The sins of men & angels do nothing to impede the great works of the Lord which accomplish His will"  Augustine
God’s call to ministry includes His timing too.There’s always a delay in the desert (Gal 1:17) while God prepares you,.
When you take a personal strength for granted, it becomes a weakness without you realizing it.
When you're down to nothing,God's up to something. "Stand firm &see the deliverance the Lord will give you!" 2Chron.20:17
“Look carefully at how you live! Live purposefully,not as the unwise but as wise,sensible,intelligent people” Eph5:15 (Amp)
Whatever sin you're quickest to judge & criticize in others reveals what you secretly hate most about yourself. Rom 2:1-6
I've noticed that before marriage opposites attract but after marrying opposites attack! What was cute becomes annoying.
@JesusNeedsNewPR What up? I've never blocked u. Where in the world did you get that idea? I just checked it.
Forgetting yourself isnt the final step of love but the first.  See 1 Cor 10:24
Today you'll be as joyful as you choose to be. Joy is a decision:"I WILL rejoice in the Lord!" It's your choice to rejoice.
Pastors:everytime u refuse to retaliate at those who make fun of you & remain silent as Jesus did,you grow in power-Mt27:14
Wisdom is knowing the right thing to do. Character is doing it when u dont feel like it. See Eccl 8:5
@AlanCult I delete tweets when people misjudge motive.It's a waste of time to blog a full explanation to those who want to argue.
Your wisdom, not your age, is what matters in leadership. Age only matters if you're cheese.
You LEARN faith thru testing ,hope thru darkness, patience thru delay, godliness by returning good for evil
"The purpose of Christ's redeeming work was to make it possible for bad men to become good -deeply,radically&finally" Tozer
I challenge every pastor to intentionally increase your giving percentage every yr & grow far beyond tithing.Luke 16:11
Many leaders cant challenge others to be generous because they arent!"Who is willing to follow my example&give?"1 Chron29:5
BIBLICAL leaders use themselves as examples to challenge others. Paul often did.See David's courageous model! 1Chron 29:2-5
" I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others.”- Paul  2 Cor. 8:8
Paul COMPARED the Macedonia church's commitment to Corinth's & challenged them to MATCH it 2 Cor. 8:1-8. Wise teaching tool
Every single drop of blood that fell from Jesus' body on the Cross shouted "I love you! I love you! I love you THIS much!"
For 30 yrs our plan was to turn spectators into participators,consumers to contributors,an audience into an army.It worked!
Mary, it's true. Over 10,000 Saddleback members havenow served in missions overseas through our network & P.E.A.C.E. plan
Most problems are rooted in our attempts to play God, thinking only of ourselves, & an unwillingness to delay gratification
To "appreciate" means "to raise in value" Everytime you appreciate anyone, you raise their value.
If you want your wife to treat you like a king,treat her as a queen. See Ephesians 5:25
What you BECOME on earth matters far more than what you DO. You're taking your character to heaven,not your career.
When you settle the WHY of your lifework, God will show you HOW. He's far more concerned with your motive than method.
I've said it before... some people are so open minded their brains fall out. Just read another example.
RT @LexiTalks Wow @RickWarren takes me to church now! Saddleback's services on their iPhone app! http://bit.ly/ajMuzb
There's really no such thing as a "Christian business" only Christian business people. Jesus saves people,not organizations
Marriage takes FAR MORE than love! In the right situation,u can fall in love with ANYONE but a marriage would be a disaster
To my single adult friends: You attract what you ARE, not what you WANT. If you want a godly lifemate, you must be one.
Nothing worthwhile is ever easy.But while you're working on it,God's working on YOU-which is far more inportant to eternity
Everytime you take responsibility FOR someone,you take responsibility FROM them, creating dependency & weakening them.
Godly parenting is the task of moving you kids from dependence on you to independence to dependence upon God
Raising kids with strong character requires doing less FOR them and teaching them to do more for themselves.
For exponential growth,the pastor must give the ministry to the people and the people must give the leadership to the pastor
This year's 21st Harvest Crusade with friend @greglaurie was one:of the best we've ever had.,  http://bit.ly/arMF6P
Ego tempts u to write on ministry too soon.I tested PurposeDriven Church 15yrs before writing.PROVE it before u PROMOTE it!
Beautiful word Mike!  @ClarkRev "Every saint has a past. Every sinner has a future"
God’s CALL to ministry includes His TIMING.There’s always a delay in the desert (Gal 1:17) while God prepares u. Trust Him!
To grow a mature faith u must learn to trust that God is working in other's lives even when you disagree with theim.
God's work starts at the edge of impossibility.The next time you say "It's impossible" listen for laughter from heaven.
No one counterfeits $3 bills since they don’t exist. Phony miracles,churches & believers indicate the genuine is out there.
Never waste time or energy fixing the blame.Use it to fix the problem.
Worship Leaders:FORGET about leading!Just worship authentically &people will follow your example.Muchow is the best at this
Suicide bombers are murderers,not martyrs. Martyrs are killed BY OTHERS for refusing to renounce their faith.
"To a nation who didnt call on me,I say'Here am I!Here am I!' All day I’ve held out my hands to an obstinate people" Isa.65:1-2
When offended by others tell God, not gossipers.Take it to the Throne, not the phone!God reduces hurt.Gossips reinforce it.
If you're praying about it God's working on it.
God doesn’t respond to begging,bargaining,bribing,badgering,or bemoaning our problems.He acts when we BELIEVE. See Heb.11:6
Couples with miscarriages never say they lost a "fetus" "God ordained & planned my days before I was born" Psalm139:16
'It's senseless to work so hard from early morning until late night...God wants u to get your proper rest" Ps.127:2 LB
For a sharper mind,better attitude &more patience go to sleep earlier! “In vain you rise early & stay up late” Psalm127:2
RT @paulwasher Never forget:We're mortal.Life is short.Everything we do has eternal significance.Those who live well,die well
Don't fear Satan.Fear you don't know God- his love, holiness &power- as intimately as he intends.That's wasting your life.
Until u ask the right questions, u wont have the right strategy.Without the right strategy you'll never get the right results
If u see a success, someone made a courageous choice. If u see healing,somone loved. If u see a miracle,someone trusted God
3 purposes of a daily time alone with God:To give devotion to Him, get direction from Him, grow daily in Him. Don't miss it
Saddleback has 22 nations left  to be the 1st local church in history to "make disciples in EVERY nation"  as Jesus commanded
The most underrated staff position is Jr High Pastor. If u can keep their attention u can speak to any group.God bless u!
Live today in such a way that you're sure to fail unless God helps you. That's Living by Faith. Trusting requires risking.
No church GROWS to the size God intends without Pruning&Weeding=tasks as essential for fruitfulness as Planting&Harvesing.
Avery Willis,towering giant of world missions & dearest friend,died this AM of leukemia.Well done, good&faithful Servant!
Pain warns you something's wrong. Without it, you'd ignore what needs to be fixed in your life.What needs changing in you?
The "peace that transends understanding" (Phil.4:7) comes from trusting God fully in situations you don't understand.
The greatest relational lessons come from relational pain...financial lessons from financial pain, health lessons from...etc
You'll often recieve your brightest insights during your darkest days IF you humbly listen to God in quiet trust.
I'm back in service. Eyesight is fine. Will preach this weekend on what pain can teach us Thanks for your prayers everyone!
A doctor put protective contacts on my corneas as bandages during the healing. I am NOT blind. Thank you.
Thank you for prayers for my eyes. Another doctor visit this PM. May God use this pain for His Glory. Rom.8:28
My eyes were severely burned by a toxic poison.Hospitalized Mon.Excruciating pain.Now home.Pray my sight loss is restored
Pastors:It's more important that your HEART be prepared than using all your time on preparing your message for this wkend.
"God always gives his best to those who leave the choice to him" spoken to Kay &me on our wedding day by Leonard Ravenhill.
Learning from mistakes is slow & painful.Learning from mentors is faster & easier-but it requires humility & teachability.
2 beautiful women! Kay Warren &amp; Angelina Jolie did a press conf for orphan care. http://twitpic.com/25yik0
Satan will NEVER encourage you to be unselfish & generous so if you feel the slightest inclination- ACT on it NOW!
You must let go of something you’ve got, to move to something you’ve not.
Do what God CALLS u to do with your life & you'll succeed. Do what u think will prove your worth & you'll fail miserably.
EVERY strategy has a downside.That doesn't mean u reject it, but you weigh the benefits with the cost & act wisely.
God did not bring you this far just to leave you where you are. "He who began a good work in you will complete it" Ph.1:6
"Socialism always eventually runs out of other people's money to spend" - James Robison
God gave NO answer to Job's pain for 39 CHAPTERS!Only silence! Trials test my faith by not knowing how far I am from Ch40!
"What I tell you in the dark, tell others when light comes" Mt10:27  If U are in darkness now -LISTEN for God's whisper!
Talking about your own suffering in an attempt to identify with someone in pain NEVER helps.Just be there & listen in love.
PD NETWORK: Bishop Walter Hawkins, a great pastor,friend & Grammy composer/ singer died today. Pray for Love Center Church.

Integrity is like virginity.Once you give it up it's gone for good."The dishonest are ruined by their own duplicity"Pr11:3
Jesus began his Church as a FAMILY.It changed to an institution in Rome,a political view in Europe,& a business in America.
JOY is the result of serving God's purposes, from his perspective, by his power, & for his glory.
Candor creates credibility.Have the courage to say the last 10%."An honest answer is a sign of true friendship"Prov.24:26
To see yourself as you really are you must FIRST see God as he really is. Only then can "the truth set you free" John 8:32

"Everything is permissible for me but not everything is beneficial. I will not be mastered by anything" 1 Cor. 6:12
Many activities aren’t necessarily wrong, just not necessary! Do what's indispensible. “Let the dead bury the dead” Lk.9:60
You can bank on this: God will have the last word and it will be good.
Why keep beating yourself for sins God's forgotten? "I blot out your sins for my sake & NEVER think of them again"Isa43:25
Many who believe ALL the Bible is true conveniently ignore the parts that refute their beliefs.We must FOLLOW IT ALL too.
Misusing ANY doctrine to excuse evangelistic apathy &defend a failure to witness to those Jesus loves is exegetical apostasy
"Love NEVER FAILS!" 1 Cor13:8 But my sinful nature typically blames my failures on everything EXCEPT my own LACK of LOVE!
"If I am lifted up, I WILL DRAW ALL men unto me" -Jesus. If you lift HIM up, not yourself, HE keeps his promise&draws them!
If you genuinely LOVE people, you'd have to lock the church doors to keep people away. People flock to Christlike love.
LOVE always attracts.Huge crowds "multitudes" followed Jesus everywhere & because He LOVED them they listened to him.
Imperfections make your face uniquely YOU -proof God didnt want a clone of anyone else. Every mark is a beauty mark to God.
A church stays small when a pastor uses an outdated preaching STYLE.God called u for today's hearers,not 500 or 50 yrs ago.
Rebellion SEEMS like freedom but rebellion has its limits too. "Everything has limits except God's commands" Psalm 119:96
Just read that Purpose Driven Life surpassed 1 million sold in another language again.This time KOREAN. 30 M worldwide
"...Christ set you FREE from the evil powers of this world. So why do u keep on following rules of the world?” Col.2:20 NLT
FREEDOM is not the absence of limit. It is the POWER God graciously offers you to say YES to what’s right & NO to wrong.
Whatever you're BITTER about you're WRONG about.  God NEVER blesses bitterness. See Heb.12:15
When you find yourself at the right place at the right time for the right purpose you are God's Reward to someone else.
Paul's formula: Opportunity+Opposition= God's Will "A great door has opened to me AND many oppose me" 1 Cor. 16:9
Look to Jesus! "Consider Him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that u wont grow weary & lose heart" Heb.2:3
If GOD has called you to do something, don't be surprised when opposition shows up. Duh!
To do what you've never done you must think in ways you've never thought.
God watches how accurately u represent the words of those u disagree with..It's dishonest to use their words out of context
For anything to LAST it must be built on God's purpose. "U can make ur plans,but only God's purpose will prevail" Pr.19:21
The greatest churches are yet to be. Styles change but "God's PURPOSES are the SAME for every generation" Ps.33:11
I give all my time to young pastors & leaders in obedience to Ps.145:4-"One generation will explain Your works to the next"
You can't know how important your loyalty to others is until you've experienced betrayal yourself. See Prov.20:6
Yesterday celebrated 35 yrs married to Kay. This wkend I teach God's Word on "Creating a Marriage That Lasts a Lifetime"
In all UNBELIEF you'll find an inflated opinion of self & a low view of God (paraphrasing Horatius B, 1860)
U can IMPRESS people from a distance but can only IMPACT them up close. That requires letting people see your weakness too.
The biggest mistake leaders make is to lose their focus & start majoring on minor issues.Every distraction is a temptation.
Nothing is as important to your job as thinking, yet nothing is harder to find time for. You must schedule THINK time.
Effective leaders learn to tell engaging stories with a purpose and an action step.
A church's culture- its values,priorities,traditions,taboos & competencies- is known & passed on in STORIES. See Ps.78:2-4
"A gospel that does not deal with the issues of the day is not the Gospel at all" - Martin Luther
Growth is the proof of LIFE.It's natural&normal for all living things.Life NEVER stands still.If u r not growing, ur dying.
God considers the depth of your repentance, not the depth of your sin, when deciding how he uses you.  See Isaiah 57:15
When a church's growth stalls, the causes are 99% due to factors inside the church, not outside it.
"Avoid irreverent babble & pointless discussions that lead you further away from God"  2 Tim. 2:16
U don’t grow in humility by trying to be humble.Just shift your focus off yourself & on to God's greatness & other's needs.
You can learn from anyone- even hypocrites !"So practice & obey what they say but don't follow their example" Matt 23:3

PAUL"Follow my example as I follow Christ's"1 Cor11:1 "Imitate me"1Cor.4:16 "We are a model for u to follow" 2 Th3:7-9 Who do u follow?
EVERYONE learns by copying models.We dont need to apologize for that.Then we grow by adapting.That's creativity!
Wanting to be the best at anything is a competitive ambition,not a Life Mission.You were created for a purpose far greater
SOCIAL NETWORKING RULE#1: When you have nothing to say,say nothing! Then when u DO speak up, people will pay attention!
"Only those with God's Spirit can understand spiritual truth.To others it seems foolish & makes no sense" 1 Cor.2:14
Nothing can be politically correct when it is morally wrong."Woe to those who call evil good & good evil" Isaiah 5:20
Getting to know God is not the end of life but the BEGINNING of it. "My purpose is to give life in all its fullness"Jn10:10
PREACHERS: You dont have to hit a home run every week to grow a strong church... just consistent singles.
Happiness doesnt happen by focusing on it. It's a by-product of giving your life away in service to God & others.See Mk8:35
The greatest things in life arent things.Never confuse your value with your valuables nor your self-worth with net-worth
What if God showed u all he COULD have done in ur life if u'd trusted him more?"only a few miracles due to unbelief""Mt13:58
When people call an ocean oil spill caused by human drilling "an Act of God"'-THAT friends, is taking God's name in vain!
God gives u enough time to do His Will. If u can't get it all done-ur doing stuff out of His Will or doing it a wrong way.
Your words leave an emotional wake behind u. No comment is trivial if u r a leader."Reckless words cut like a sword"Pr12:18
God uses PAIN to Inspect us,Correct us,Direct us & Perfect us. "They meant it for bad but God meant it for good!"' Gen50:20
Saddleback TONIGHT: Michael Horton,Jim Belcher,Kay Warren,MilesMcPherson,Skye Jethani & me on "Future of the Global Church"
Study the STOPS of Jesus, not just his step -the interruptions he allowed. Every healing was an interruption! R U flexible?
God’s BLESSING on you is always in proportion to your DEPENDENCE on Him. Great anointing is the fruit of great trusting.
Your dominant sin seeks friendships that affirm it. The critical find other critics in a church.Gossips attract gossips,etc
... and if the grass looks perfectly green from afar- you can bet it is astroturf.
Stop Global Whining: "Do everything without complaining or arguing..." Phil.2:14-15
Marriages that work take work. The grass isnt greener on the other side of the fence. It's  greener wherever you water it!
CHURCH! An army's strength isnt seen by how many eat in the mess hall but how many are fighting on the front line battle.
A church's health is measured by its sending capacity, not seating capacity: How many mobilized for our Mission? Mt28:19-20
FAITH is VOICE-ACTIVATED."In the same spirit of faith we speak because we believe" 2 Cor 4:13 Are u speaking faith or fear?
"Don't avoid responsibility saying 'I didn't know.' God reads our minds & knows our thoughts& will pay us back" Prov .24:12
The more I know MY OWN sinfulness,the less inclined I am to disparage OTHERS" He who's been forgiven much loves much"Lk7:47
God's purpose is my peace. God's presence is my pleasure. God's power is my protection.
"Satan is a chronic grumbler. A Christian ought to be a living doxology" - Martin Luther
Life minus love =zero
The more you indulge your self, the more your self will demand. (See Prov.27:20)
God WORKS when u WAIT.  "The vision awaits its appointed time.If it SEEMS slow, WAIT for it! It will SURELY come" Hab 2:3
Putdowns from the pulpit reveal pride in the preacher’s heart. The flesh is speaking -not God- at that moment.

SERVANT LEADERS constantly ask:How do my actions&words hinder or frustrate those working with me? What's it like for them?
Critical thinking solves problems.Criticizing without thinking creates them.
One day of God’s favor does more than a thousand days of my labor.
One day:“People of every race&nation&language will obey him.His rule eternal! His kingdom will never be destroyed” Dan7:14
Maybe Satan gave us highlighters so we could focus on easy Bible verses we like & ignore hard ones like “love your enemies”
Anyone who claims to believe in grace but doesn’t freely GIVE IT to everyone is a liar. See 1 John 4:20
Forgiveness= freedom. When u release your offender YOU are freed from pain."You rip yourself apart with anger" Job18:4 (GW)
I’d rather fail in the world’s eyes being who God made me to be than to succeed by living someone else’s life.
Like great preaching, great writing must come from your heart if it is to touch & transform the hearts of others.
Leaders must know how to accept rejection & reject acceptance. What matters is what God thinks about you.
God the Trinty lives in unending & unconditional loving community.God has always  known it is better to give than receive.
People respond to responsibility. But if you treat them as babies you'll have to diaper them the rest of your ministry.
"Who are you to judge Someone Else's servant?To his own Master he stands or falls" Rom14:4 Judging another's ministry=pride
God doesnt need your permission to bless & use me. God doesnt need my permission to bless & use you. See Romans14:4
In ministry,a peaceful heart comes from accepting that God LOVES TO USE people & programs u don’t like or agree with.
Compassion for others isnt from OUR goodness but from GOD'S grace."Be kind&compassionate-just as God forgave you in Christ"
I've delayed the release of THE HOPE YOU NEED because I think another book I'm writing is more necessary at this critical moment.
No church gives&serves sacrificially til the pastor models it PERSONALLY,asks for it UNAPOLOGETICALLY,expects it CONFIDENTLY

Eccl.6:9"Enjoy what u have rather than desiring what u don't have" NO DEBT! Use it up,wear it out,make it do or do without!
GREATNESS isnt determined by fame,wealth,talent or education but by how much it takes to discourage you. Refuse to give up!
Faith is a trapeze act: You’ve got to let go of what you have got, to grab on to that of which you have not. Let it go.
GREAT people make others feel great.Small people make others feel small."Encourage each other & build each other up"1Th5:11
God sometimes removes a person from your life for your protection. Don't run after them.
Faithfulness in secret ways yields fruitfulness in public ways “Your Father sees in secret &will reward u openly"Mt6:18 KJV

Pray for your pastor today. He'll preach better & you'll learn better!
Preaching is the task of starting with what people WANT then helping them move to what they really NEED.
If God tells you to give something away & you're unwilling to let it go, you don't own that item - it OWNS YOU.
