America is not a racist country, it has been the worlds most open and accepting. That is what gave it the global advantage. 		But wave after wave of immigrant has faced resentment because they make the natives work harder and compete. That is why the winds blow both ways.
@cpatel17 @DanielGershburg @hardaway @realDonaldTrump It is better than being deported now. The winds will change and Americans will become more accepting of immigrants. Today, the discussion is toxic.
@DanielGershburg @hardaway @realDonaldTrump Democrats had full control of government for a long time--as Republicans had. They failed to compromise by insisting on path to citizenship for undocumented. They could have provided conditional green cards and Republicans would have agreed. 		Also held skilled immigrants hostage
@DanielGershburg @hardaway @realDonaldTrump The Democrats created the mess and Trump added fuel to the fire. Both sides are responsible for the misrable state of US immigration.

It is amazing how the people who have been hyping Bitcoin and causing innocent and ignorant people to invest (and lose) a proportion of their life savings are now setting expectations of a $4000 price next year, not a million dollars as they had promised. https://t.co/LGwIFF6XeT
@wences @Nouriel Given the way that scamsters are manipulating the Bitcoin price, there is no telling where it will be. But I'll go on the record affirming my position that the price is headed to ZERO--not the million dollars that you promised. It is the largest Ponzi scheme in history.
@BrandNewsTeam We need to lay the railroad tracks, the standards and rules, for new technologies. That is the key to creating new trillion dollar industries. We would not have had an automotive industry if there werent rules and regulations.		What we have today with drones is the Wild Wild West
This is precisely why we need to educate the public on the dangers of new technologies, debate what is ethical, and create sensible laws and regulations to protect the public.		Few are aware of what is now possible; laws were created in a different era. https://t.co/HR7wNs789N
@BrandNewsTeam @mkedrones @tanzinavega @TheTakeaway Google maps and iPhones can't be used to bomb schools and government buildings. Your cameras can't reach the fire escapes of apartment buildings by themselves.
@mkedrones @tanzinavega @TheTakeaway We need to raise awareness of the risks before lives are lost. The loss of privacy is bad enough.
@mkedrones @BrandNewsTeam @tanzinavega @TheTakeaway The public needs to be educated on the issues and have a say. Laws are codified ethics and ethics are a consensus that societies develop.
@mkedrones @tanzinavega @TheTakeaway I love drones and I love technology. I worry about the dark sides and misuse. See what happened with social media without regulations. A few became billionaires while democracy crumbled and lives were lost.
@BrandNewsTeam @mkedrones @tanzinavega @TheTakeaway For business use, there are clear yet antiquated regulations. But for a kid that buys a drone on Amazon, there really are none. The registration and put your own sticker on the drone requirements are a joke. 		And then we have no defenses against swarms of armed drones.
@mkedrones @tanzinavega @TheTakeaway These proposals are not adequate. It won't be long before we have a 9-11 type of drone attack and lawmakers will wake up to the risks.They will disawow responsibility for these and demand draconian changes. 		We have entered the drone age unprepared.
@mkedrones @tanzinavega @TheTakeaway So what are we disagreeing on? I am doubtful of the Spring date but let's watch and see.

@droneanalyst @NPR We will not be able to see the benefits of this amazing technology unless there are clear, understandable, and enforceable regulations.		Imagine if we had cars without road regulations. We would never have created an industry.
Regulations for non commercial drone use are bad enough, starting with the joke of registration (mark your own aircraft). 		But even worse than I thought for commercial use. Hodgepodge of regulations with no real ability to enforce. Even lawyers can't figure these out https://t.co/TPa9gDOvA9
@EverydayFinance I fear you may be right right but we don't have the NRA defending the right for every American to fly an armed drone...yet
@droneanalyst @NPR Here are the regulations for registering. Mark your own aircraft! 		Register as a "modeler" and mark your model aircraft with your registration number in case it is lost or stolen.		Costs $5 and is valid for 3 years.
I fear that it will take a 911-type of attack or a school bombing to accelerate progress on the development of drone laws. 		Kids can literally buy drones comparable to what the US military used in Afghanistan for practically nothing and come up with destructive uses. https://t.co/kACms8pb1e
@droneanalyst @NPR These are not laws either! They are are helpful tips
Compare to the regulations we have for land-based vehicles. Every vehicle from day it is manufactured has identification. Safety rules, restrictions on where you can go, registration and tracking, etc. 		That is what we will need for drones https://t.co/DKSsnfbZqH

I've reached the point of disgust with the leaders of Silicon Valley who pretend to be uplifting humanity. It's all about money, ego, and power. 		Entrepreneurs who really care about the world don't get a cent of VC or support. Companies don't give back, even to their communities

@twadhwa I agree and neither should corporations. This is why we need public and open platforms. China is the other extreme.
@twadhwa Governments provide roads but don't control where you go; they provide infrastructure but don't control consumption. 		Every country has its own values, ideals, and ethical standards. Why should a private corporation from another country/culture control this; this is colonialism.
@twadhwa It isn't people who need to be restricted, it is corporations that are selling defective products that cause hatred and violence--and loss of privacy. 		Social media is a public platform and should not be controlled by for-profit corporations
