@David_Quinones @adamvander007 @thinkprogress Documented - people who are legally in the USA are being arrested and detained by ICE. These are law abiding and tax paying people. It is un-American and so wrong. ICE is arresting anyone.
@johndxcx @thinkprogress What? Your being ridiculous. Get educated. Law abiding and good tax paying green card holders and naturalized citizens are wrongfully being arrested and detained by ICE. There is no justice here.
@adamvander007 @David_Quinones @thinkprogress What? Many people pay more taxes than you. Innocent and legal people are wrongfully arrested by ICE. The ICE databases have numerous errors. This agency‚Äôs technology Infrastructure, applications and databases are approximately 20 years old.
