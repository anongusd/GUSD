Fact: @joshua_harder is for the Bay Area &amp; loyal to the Bay Area. If Harder really cared about #CD10, or the Valley, he would not have changed his voting registration to San Francisco. The fact is he only came back here to run for Congress. #BayAreaHarder		https://t.co/X25xiSDaQx
In the 2016 election @joshua_harder abandoned the Central Valley to register where he lived in SF. Instead of voting in #CD10 by absentee, he voted w/ Nancy Pelosi &amp; Bay interests over caring about our Central Valley issues here at home. #BayAreaHarder 		https://t.co/EesMwzwXgU

While @joshua_harder was getting chummy today with his Bay Area boy @GavinNewsom, I advanced my legislation financing new Water Storage projects. This is an actual victory for our Valley &amp; our economy. #BayAreaHarder continues to tie himself to those funding him: The Bay Area.

Sonia &amp; I would like to send our thoughts &amp; prayers to the McCain family in their time of loss. John was a great friend &amp; valued colleague. I have always admired his tenacity, virtue &amp; unwavering commitment to the USA. This country lost a great leader yesterday &amp; a good man.
Thanks, Terry! I am proud to stand with the many small businesses that keep our communities running. https://t.co/jj8Fqkx2hH
I look forward to this debate &amp; I’m pleased @joshua_harder finally agreed to equitable debate terms. It’s unfortunate my opponent rejected similar or the same terms for @SanJoaquinFB, @TheHouseModesto &amp; St. Frances of Rome &amp; that he pulled out of the Rotary. Missed opportunities. https://t.co/1FvZ3CcMCF
Why did @joshua_harder miss the Water Rally? #BayAreaHarder		Tom Orvis, the Stanislaus (Farm) bureau’s governmental affairs director,  said "Harder doesn’t seem to understand the water issue like Denham  does." https://t.co/zW50lC7ooa
Could not agree with @Ted_Howze more. It is absolutely unacceptable that @joshua_harder was a no show at the Water Rally in Sacramento. His silence on this speaks loudly. #BayAreaHarder is trying to play both sides &amp; fool #CA10 voters while still pleasing his #BayArea donors. https://t.co/ABetuWPpn8
California has the most human trafficking arrests in the country. Last week, we hosted community and industry leaders to discuss methods to battle human trafficking in #CA10 and across the nation.	https://t.co/9YBbeBnxtZ
Thank you, Mary, for your support. I will always put the people of #CA10 first, and be a voice for the Valley in Washington. https://t.co/in2QvprlL8
@joshua_harder @modbee @turlockjournal A real leader would have been at the state capitol with the rest of the candidates &amp; elected officials (from both parties) fighting for our water rights. Would have been a big help if you could have put politics down for one day and helped our district out. #CA10 @WorthYourFight
@joshua_harder @turlockjournal @modbee Again #BayAreaHarder is being a liar. The facts are Harder agreed to the same terms we have consistently stated all along. It's a shame you didn't agree to these exact same terms with @TheHouseModesto, @SanJoaquinFB or St. Frances of Rome. Frankly, it's disrespectful as well.
Ridiculous. @joshua_harder outright lied again on debates after caving to our terms for an equitable debate. There's NO agreement w/ the AAUW or anyone else other then @modbee &amp; @turlockjournal. Since Harder can't be honest: these are the only 2 additional debates we will be at.
@joshua_harder Again #BayAreaHarder misleads &amp; outright lies. We offered these same terms in every debate invitation prior. We are the ones who compromised on this issue in debate negotiations prior to @TurlockJournal, it's Harder who has agreed to finally have an equitable debate terms. #CA10
I'm pleased to announce we have agreed in principle to a debate with @turlockjournal. @joshua_harder backed tracked after being caught in a lie on debates &amp; has now agreed to our terms of a ticketed event. I look forward to this  opportunity to debating issues in front of voters.
We must come together as a community to stand up for all our neighbors. Hatred and violence are not welcome here.	https://t.co/qSitM2o2XF
Thank you for your endorsement, Harold! Together, we're fighting for a stronger, better #CA10. https://t.co/jrmHAYd0M7
It’s shameful that @joshua_harder continues misleading people about debates, water, &amp; so much more. He claimed tonight a debate had been set by the @turlockjournal, below you can see that was a blatant lie. His integrity continues to be as scarce as his voting history. #CA10 https://t.co/0koY1eVChp
The Valley needs an advocate that we can trust, not an outsourcing profiteer. As a farmer and a small business owner here in the Valley, I’m proud to create local jobs right here in the Valley. I’m fighting for our families, and our community. Learn more in my latest ad. https://t.co/2D9FfV8N6y
99% of  @joshua_harder's money comes from outside the Valley. Mostly from Bay Area liberals. Maybe that's why Josh missed the bipartisan water rally? #BayAreaHarder is not for the Valley. https://t.co/XttD2NcGh1

Fighting the state #watergrab has to be our number one priority. For our region, our economy and our very way of life. Josh Harder’s failure to attend and fight the state water grab or meet with local ag leaders shows he’s not fit to represent the Central Valley. https://t.co/yYHtyGkJFz
It was great to see the community come together to stand up for our #WaterRights and show the rest of California how important our water resources are.	https://t.co/fJWIyh83X1
After the Water Rally in Sacramento, I had the privilege of attending the debate hosted by the @SanJoaquinFB. #BayAreaHarder failed to show up again &amp; again failed to give the debate host the simple courtesy of declining. So I answered questions on ag, water &amp; infrastructure. https://t.co/by1z8r7Qg6
Today leaders from all over the Central Valley rallied on the steps of the Capitol, to fight against a state water grab that would cripple our region &amp; local economies. This is a fight for our  very way of life. I was proud to stand with &amp; address this group. @WorthYourFight https://t.co/rkHDKFwLO1
Leaders in Washington need to see first-hand how important access to safe and abundant water supplies is to the people of the Central Valley.	https://t.co/0trcY1W5Jk
Today our Vets for Denham coalition had a great BBQ &amp; Cigar social event.

It has now been over 48 hours since @joshua_harder endorsed a racially charged attack on my wife. He must apologize &amp; explain himself. He needs to come out &amp; condemn these remarks by this protester &amp; stand against race shaming in this election. We have to be better then this. https://t.co/Q3I4ygcdZS
I know firsthand that the dedication and perseverance that make a great soldier also make a great farmer. The VET-2-FARM Act will empower our veterans to pursue careers in the agricultural industry, just like I did.	https://t.co/v98na0mfwf
I have always been honored to have strong and diverse support at home. It is both humbling and inspiring to see how many young people, from all walks of life, show up to volunteer for our campaign each week. https://t.co/m0O5KFBPpx
It has now been over 24 hours since @joshua_harder endorsed a reprehensible attack on my wife that was based on her ethnicity. He has so far failed to apologize or explain himself. This should transcend politics and party. Harder should apologize to my wife &amp; family immediately.
Sacramento’s reckless #watergrab is a threat to the Central Valley’s water rights. As a farmer myself, I know all too well the damage that this will do to our economy and agricultural community.	https://t.co/G50WEx5BxN

During his visit to the Central Valley, @SecretaryZinke saw firsthand how devastating the loss of 40% of our river water will be. As California struggles with drought and wildfires, we need reliable water storage now more than ever.	https://t.co/MqsCZ3hw1s
Mr. Malhi is a respected leader in our community &amp; a proud American. This is the 3rd incident in less than 2 weeks members of my team were targeted. Hate Crimes have no place in our society. The people responsible for this reprehensible act of hatred must be brought to justice. https://t.co/PPaPyzmiCE
As California families continue to face the threats of drought and wildfires, it is critical that California works to expand water storage. The New WATER Act is an important step towards improving water access across our state.	https://t.co/GM947WxzfQ
@joshua_harder @modbee I have now accepted 5 debates/forums. (Farm Bureau, The House, St. Frances, The Rotary &amp; ModBee) #BayAreaHarder has accepted only 1 &amp; accepted publicly 24+ hours after I did. His integrity continues to be as absent as his voting history or local community involvement. #none #CA10
As a farmer and a veteran, I am proud to support a bill that will provide employment opportunities and education to veterans interested in working in agriculture.	https://t.co/AkK0vRkvwx
Furthermore, I will still be at the House and San Joaquin Farm Bureau if @joshua_harder decides he would like to introduce himself to these key stakeholders in our local communities. @modbee #CA10
I’m disappointed that @joshua_harder failed to keep his promise to debate anytime &amp; anywhere. His failure to be involved in our local community is inexcusable. Even though the Bee has endorsed Harder,  I accept the @modbee invite to debate. https://t.co/Fw9xoUoBeO

I understand the challenges veterans have returning to civilian life. I am working to provide easy access to information about available jobs, apprenticeships, job training, and education &amp; connecting veterans to jobs in which they can thrive.
No doubt, another major drought will happen. We must start building more water storage in California. It is vital and overdue. I am working for real solutions to the water issue. #BayAreaHarder has no solutions and does not understand the importance of water in our region.
In a region plagued by drought, we should be prioritizing access to safe and clean water. That’s why I successfully introduced two amendments supporting water storage projects and the fight against CA Democrats’ #WaterGrab.		https://t.co/J1xAUt8Owp

Having served, I know the sacrifices made by our veterans. I have always &amp; will continue to work for our veterans. Fighting for access to services, better care &amp; helping find jobs. Our veterans fulfilled their duty. #BayAreaHarder can’t be bothered to do his civic duty &amp; vote.
I had the privilege to talk with @209magazine about the important issues Valley Families are facing here in #CA10. Look for it on the Studio209 YouTube page https://t.co/lPkhRTGX7b

#BayAreaHarder &amp; his environmentalist friends intend to waste 40% + of water for working families &amp; local farms with destructive economic impacts for the Central Valley. Without water, Valley businesses will be devastated. @joshua_harder doesn't understand that.
We already have a scientifically based plan to meet the CA ecological development goals. The state’s decision to deprive Central Valley farmers of 40% of their water is an irresponsible move with potentially devastating effects.	https://t.co/3diIUBb09w
Our economy depends on farmers, and farmers depend on water. The path to drought recovery isn’t to deprive Californians of more water.	https://t.co/yh7OWDwX4v
#BayAreaHarder said he's willing to debate. Now he's balking &amp; hiding behind excuses to avoid them. We have four opportunities to debate issues PUBLICLY under equitable circumstances with local stakeholders. No more excuses. Let's get this done for #CA10. https://t.co/OR2PqZV1cV
@joshua_harder I accepted public debates w/ Harder by reputable organizations in #CA10. Josh's campaign can invite anyone from the public he wants, there will be equal # of invites between both campaigns. Once the venue is full, everyone else can watch live. #BayAreaHarder balks on debates.

#BayAreaHarder claims to have business experience, but @joshua_harder doesn’t understand that without water Valley businesses will be devastated.
The environmentalist backers of #BayAreaHarder used the SWRCB to silence the voice of the people of #CA10 &amp; plan to flush away 40%+ of water for families &amp; local farmers devastating impacts for the Central Valley economy I will continue to fight &amp; protect our Valley water rights.
STRONG economic growth continues	WAGES continue to rise	213,000 jobs added this month	610,000 more return to the workforce again 	SMALL businesses, the nation's number one job creators, continue to grow 	WORKING families to get thousands of dollars back in their taxes this year https://t.co/kfwnj17P0F

#BayAreaHarder continues to be dishonest and spread dishonest partisan talking points and rhetoric. I deal in facts. @joshua_harder Fact: #CA10 doesn't want to be governed by the Bay Area or their interests. Actions &gt; Rhetoric. https://t.co/fJddEoci3m
Unlike @joshua_harder I don't give up so easily &amp; won't give up fighting to secure borders, protect #Dreamers &amp; fix immigration. I always do my duty, even in a tough fight. Funny how #BayAreaHarder can show up to protests, but can't show up &amp; do his duty at the ballot box. #CA10
Last week’s #FarmBill passage is good news for Central Valley farmers. I look forward to seeing continued ag industry expansion. https://t.co/2KZehNgYSp
Another day - and more lies from #BayAreaHarder. #Fact Both parties have failed for decades on immigration reform. I will never give up the fight regardless of party or politics. @joshua_harder's inexperience &amp; partisan rhetoric won't solve problems, they ARE the problem in DC.
@joshua_harder #BayAreaHarder continues to prove a liar. @joshua_harder knows that I voted against this bill. Harder clearly isn't ready for prime time &amp; his integrity is as absent as his voting history. Here is the real vote on passage of that bill: https://t.co/rHZuqLeyeD #FactCheck #CA10
#BayAreaHarder's two recent fundraisers in the Bay Area &amp; his boasting about an endorsement from San Jose Rep. Zoe Lofgren, continues to prove where @joshua_harder's true loyalty is: San Jose/San Francisco - not here at home in the Central Valley. #CA10 Actions &gt; Rhetoric
@joshua_harder #BayAreaHarder is once again using dishonest rhetoric to fire up his progressive bay area liberal supporters. Fact: I have worked non-stop in Congress to provide for secure borders, a permanent solution for #Dreamers, &amp; an end for family separations.
I look forward to working with Republicans, Democrats, and the White House to make immigration reform a reality.	https://t.co/A9BFrZKU1z
I'm pulling all of my colleagues together to push for passage of my bill that secures the border, keeps families together, and provides a permanent solution to our nation's #DREAMers. I won't give up the fight.
@joshua_harder That's interesting Mr. Harder, since you obviously don't vote here either. #CA10 https://t.co/8ydEZM9nFr
It’s time to come together to address the issue of family separation and vote on legislative solutions.	https://t.co/jJSUhvvR6C
A vote on immigration legislation is a long time coming. I look forward to an opportunity to make meaningful progress and bring clarity to millions of immigrants with uncertain futures.	https://t.co/Yy4yFe8Kkm
Here in my own words: My fight to get it right on immigration reform. Keep families together, strengthen border security, provide permanent fix for dreamers and close loopholes. Congress needs to do its job and get real law done. https://t.co/FBSMUMobsP
There is no reason to separate immigrant children from their families. We must work together to change this policy.	https://t.co/r6snEO3wqj
#BayAreaHarder doesn't represent our district's values. Our district wants Immigration Reform that includes Border Security. @joshua_harder wants open borders. It's because he is with the Progressive Left &amp; Silicon Valley over the Central Valley &amp; #CA10. Actions &gt; Rhetoric.
@joshua_harder More lies from #BayAreaHarder. He is just upset because like him, his party has no interest in actually solving the crisis on the border. They would rather have the political issue to use, then solve it. I am committed to leading &amp; passing real law to fix real problems.
The Compromise Bill provides a permanent fix for Dreamers, strengthens our borders, &amp; ends family separation at the border. Unlike #BayAreaHarder I am in DC right now working to pass real reform. @joshua_harder's attachment to truth is the same as his voting history. None at all.
Another day &amp; another round of lies from #BayAreaHarder. I have been on the record, opposed to separation of families. I have been working in D.C. non-stop to fix our broken immigration system, protect Dreamers &amp; provide border security - something @joshua_harder doesn't support.
Check out my interview this week with @NPR. Great discussion on the future of Dreamers and immigration reform.	https://t.co/QQ0gaAivik
I've been at the forefront of fixing our broken immigration system by leading the effort to provide certainty for our community, #Dreamers and securing our borders. @joshua_harder takes securing our borders as seriously as he does voting in local elections. Not at all!
@joshua_harder @RepJeffDenham @joshua_harder claims 15 community orgs gathered this week. Reality: they were 15 ultra-progressive liberal groups, like indivisible, who have ties &amp; financial backing from the Bay Area, like his campaign. Again proving his values are of the Silicon Valley not the Central Valley.
Again @joshua_harder is all talk &amp; dishonest. Reality: If not for my efforts on immigration, Washington would not be voting on a permanent fix for Dreamers or delivering on the promise to secure our borders. His grasp on reality seems to be as non-existent as his voting history.
@Joshua_Harder has only voted here 3 times since 2005, but wants people in CA10 to vote for him. He didn't even vote in the 2008 or 2012 Presidential Elections. Since 2005 he has one voted in 1 local election, in 2017, after he decided to run for Congress. Actions &gt; Rhetoric. https://t.co/E2CtSK3AJx
Simply put: @joshua_harder's platform, positions, values, financial backing and allegiance is to the Progressive Left &amp; Silicon Valley, not our homes in the Central Valley. https://t.co/NcHL53F3XO
While @joshua_harder continues partisan rhetoric today on #Dreamers &amp; says nothing about securing our borders, I remain hard at work to achieve both for #CA10 and #USA. Harder continues to show allegiance to bay area progressives over our home: Central Valley. Actions &gt; rhetoric
Here is the truth about the immigration reform effort in my own words: https://t.co/R61is2F0m2 I am working with my colleagues to get actual law done. Law that has been needed for decades. My opponent &amp; his party just talks partisan lines. Leadership &gt; Rhetoric @joshua_harder.
I'm working harder then anyone in congress to find real solutions for a broken immigration system, Dreamers &amp; secure borders. I helped to bring a real vote to the floor this week. Unlike @Joshua_harder &amp; the Democrat Party, I will continue to lead by action instead of rhetoric.
@joshua_harder is attacking me on immigration. He is leaving out one important fact: When his party had full control of the House, a super majority in the Senate and a DEM in the White House - they did nothing to help Dreamers. I continue to work to actually solve real problems.
