@mattatat138 @JNMRXofficial @RepJohnYarmuth The fact that you can’t admit you’re right leaning is a major character flaw. I spoke about partisanship with an emphasis on a specific position that’s supposed to be non partisan, as well as hyper partisanship. That’s completely different than leaning one way or the other
@mattatat138 @JNMRXofficial @RepJohnYarmuth Why would you think I blindly supported him? I’ve been dragged for pointing out conditions in facilities where unaccompanied immigrant children have been housed, among other things. I lean left but have no problem pointing out the shortcomings of Democrats.
@mattatat138 @JNMRXofficial @RepJohnYarmuth Because people shouldn’t be calling for bringing facts and truth to politics? That’s your solution?
@mattatat138 @JNMRXofficial @RepJohnYarmuth 😘
@mattatat138 @JNMRXofficial @RepJohnYarmuth A little creepy but ok. I still don’t care about changing your mind. You’re a rando I had a discussion with who has an aversion to fact based arguments.
@mattatat138 @JNMRXofficial @RepJohnYarmuth Still never said Trump was elected because of his money. I’m still waiting for any actual facts from you.
@mattatat138 @JNMRXofficial @RepJohnYarmuth Oh, honesty I could give a shit about changing your mind. Educate yourself and come up with your own decision
@mattatat138 @JNMRXofficial @RepJohnYarmuth Point out where I specifically said that? There has not been a single fact that you’ve actually pointed out between Obama, Clinton, or Kavanaugh’s actual qualifications. Youve coomplained. Where is your means to a solution? Keep electing morons?
@mattatat138 @JNMRXofficial @RepJohnYarmuth Look who’s bringing feelings to a facts fight.
@mattatat138 @JNMRXofficial @RepJohnYarmuth Your criticism is heavily on the Democrats. One party gets elected based on wealth, the other based on charisma.
@mattatat138 @JNMRXofficial @RepJohnYarmuth Only two of those were accomplished, educated, essentially self made individuals. Care to take a guess on who they are?
@mattatat138 @JNMRXofficial @RepJohnYarmuth Your partisanship is showing
@mattatat138 @JNMRXofficial @RepJohnYarmuth I can take ‘asshole’ but mixed with being an idiot I can’t abide. He’s an embarrassment. He frequently looks as if he’s just huffed paint thinner. Let’s be honest he speaks that way too

@mattatat138 @JNMRXofficial @RepJohnYarmuth The entire system needs to be torn down and most of them jailed. That fact is not partisan, but it is with the vast majority of people. Tribalism has taken over and no one cares about facts anymore, right now people are sticking to the lesser of 2 evils
@mattatat138 @JNMRXofficial @RepJohnYarmuth Of course it is. There’s a lascivious moron that’s President nominating bros and donors. Our votes are driven by sensationalism and half truths. None of this will get better until people start educating themselves and not relying on memes as truth
@mattatat138 @JNMRXofficial @RepJohnYarmuth Again, you’re pointing out the obvious. The fact that he was unqualified wasn’t going to get attention. Regarding any allegations, it was impossible to perform a realistic, thorough investigation into these claims within the parameters and timeframe given
@mattatat138 @JNMRXofficial @RepJohnYarmuth Captain Obvious, my argument IS that these should have been the initial and continuing points of contention, but it’s not ‘sensational’ enough to attract attention.
@mattatat138 @JNMRXofficial @RepJohnYarmuth I think your failing to understand my arguments are WHY he should be opposed. Now you’re on ‘because, Obama’ now? The issue is in the system itself allowing wholly unqualified people to hold positions such as this. Idgaf who nominated him, I would be opposed to him.
@JeffFlake you’re still a fuck up
@mattatat138 @JNMRXofficial @RepJohnYarmuth 🙄 really? That’s the stupidest thing you’ve tweeted so far, and so typical that your answer is, ‘because the Clintons’. It’s apparent you haven’t actually researched your response. Qualifications and hyper partisanship alone, should have disqualified

@mattatat138 @JNMRXofficial @RepJohnYarmuth He didn’t and still doesn’t have HALF the experience of his peers! The ability to be nominated and actually qualified at 2 different things. Have you actually researched him? Your statements are NOT indicative of that.
