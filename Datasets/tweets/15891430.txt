@pithywidow @OKnox It is just awful. And it's been years since I heard him lecture, but don't you imagine that he would have something brilliant to say about this, about life and happenstance and unfairness?
@craigliterary @Columbia I'm so sorry, Jessica. He was truly one of the greats.
@pithywidow @Columbia I know. Very painful to think about a man of such joy and dignity, and such a pillar of Columbia, dying in such a senseless accident. I'm sure he'd have something brilliant and profound to say about it.
@OKnox I want a makeup on all the great classes I never took!
@OKnox Did you take his classes too? I can hear him like it was yesterday. I was just one of his zillions of students, but he was unforgettable.

@LouiseRamsay_ Listen to that outsider perspective: It's an asset. (And let's be real, I wasn't *that* much of an outsider: I went to Columbia. And yet journalism was still intimidating to me!)
These two guys corrected and encouraged me. I hope other young people, especially young people who did not grow up in literary/intellectual circles, get the same message. If not, find me and I'll tell you myself.
Growing up in Staten Island and NJ, I'd never met a journalist or author. I was a reading junkie, but the thought that other people would want to read my stories seemed... presumptuous. Narcissistic.

@benedictevans And as a journalist, I totally disagree. We may quote sources who are critical. We may uncover damning info. But an investigation is a search for truth. Would you say we attacked Harvey Weinstein? See the prob with that formulation, which makes us the aggressors and him a victim?
@benedictevans But also: "attacks" was the WSJ's word. Not sure if Zuckerberg has used it himself.

Times Opinion editor @JBennet, on his decision to publish the #anonymous essay: "Our job is to publish op-eds that further the public’s understanding of what the hell is going on, and I think this piece makes a significant contribution.” https://t.co/r0DOCvah9L
From James Bennet, Opinion editor of the NYT, acknowledging that reporters will try to identify the author: “I’m obviously very concerned about preserving the anonymity of the writer,” Bennet told me, “but I understand reporters are doing their job.” https://t.co/r0DOCvah9L
Lest the original tweet be misinterpreted: this was just the sound of my head exploding at such a dramatic, unprecedented situation.
RT @nytmike: Text from my mom: "WTF who wrote that Op-Ed? You can tell me."
Can we just focus for a sec on:	"Given the instability many witnessed, there were early whispers within the cabinet of invoking the 25th Amendment, which would start a complex process for removing the president."	https://t.co/6oUVS4Gig3
Or is the entire newspaper bound by the promise of anonymity? I don't think so, but this is fascinating. Not sure if there's precedent.
So basically: Times reporters now must try to unearth the identity of an author that our colleagues in Opinion have sworn to protect with anonymity? https://t.co/wj2nKmDHz9

So moved by these coming-out stories about depression, and by the haunting resonance with #metoo: when shame leads us to hide individual struggles, what collective patterns do we miss? When something seems a little off, what are our obligations to inquire or intervene? https://t.co/jGWo7l8vLq

We are so not done with this story. Stay with me and @mega2e for more on Weinstein, #metoo, and where we all go from here. (And if you want a you-are-there feeling from the courthouse today, more pix on Instagram.) https://t.co/JEjGIb9Io4
This is some expert trolling. https://t.co/Z7lqf8Bu5b
One thing to note: Weinstein's lawyers have asked him to stay quiet (which he has with a few exceptions.) So beyond the blanket denial of non-consensual sex, we really don't know much about what his response to these allegations will be.
Weinstein's lawyer at the courthouse today: 		"The casting couch in Hollywood was not invented by Harvey Weinstein."		Is that... a defense?
This is almost verbatim what one of the Weinstein victims said to me today. https://t.co/fBaolVFG8E

One of the symbols of the day: this female detective leading Harvey Weinstein around in handcuffs. https://t.co/3lU03pWv1b
The symbolism of a female detective watching over a cuffed Weinstein in this courtroom.
When turning himself in, Weinstein carried biographies of Great Men in Show Business: Elia Kazan (we think by Richard Schickel) and Rodgers and Hammerstein (by Todd Purdum.) Title of the latter book: Something Wonderful.
We’re in the courtroom waiting for Weinstein. For so long he had his own private system— fancy lawyers who paid to silence women, private investigators and spies. Now he answers to the same system as the rest of us. https://t.co/ajxYCwhATw

To finish: remember that it's still early days. Something as simple as a code of conduct can take months to change. But stay with me and @mega2e and @emilysteel and the @nytimes, because we are not even close to done reporting.
None of this is to downplay the enormous impact of #metoo. The question is: now that social attitudes are shifting, can structures, laws, policies and systems follow?
I heard about striking shifts in recent months among female janitors, hotel housekeepers, nannies, eldercare providers etc, who have recently become more willing to speak up about what they've experienced. But has anything changed in terms of what recourse they have?
Very strong theme of these interviews: together we've got to figure out better tools for fighting harassment. No one really knows how to warn others about a serial harasser who moves from job to job and there's no consensus on penalties for lower-level, non-firing offenses.
And keep watching the fascinating evolution of @TIMESUPNOW. New branches are springing up in additional industries, with a common focus: not just ending harassment, but changing the whole dynamic by putting more women in power.
Also keep your eyes out for a a robust public debate about banning secret settlements, in NJ and other states. Do secret settlements enable harassment, by burying the problem, or are they sometimes a woman's best option? Are we OK with trading money for silence?
I was really struck by how many (female) entrepreneurs are working on technological solutions to the "women don't report" problem. For instance, platforms that tell you if someone else has reported the same offender. Keep your eyes on @callisto @LisaGelobter @VaultPlatform.
But most businesses don't want to talk about what they're doing, because they (or their legal depts) worry it could be construed as an admission they haven't done enough in the past. (Please send exceptions!) That's not great, because it means less open discussion.
The biggest change at the corporate level: sudden recognition that abuse of women can hurt or ruin a company's rep/business/stock price. (See: Weinstein Co, Vice, Wynn.) Harassment is now more widely seen as a business problem you need to protect against, like hacking.
And: can the federal laws that prohibit harassment ever be strengthened? Because they are full of holes, and many of the cases that recently shocked the country/world never could have prevailed in court.
A ton of hard questions came up as I reported, but these were two of the hardest: for all of the tremendous shifts of the #metoo moment, has anything really changed in recent months for a fast food worker or housekeeper who is being harassed?
Remember: while the increase in accountability is very important, mass firings are not really a solution. Harassment flourishes because of a broken system: laws, HR departments, and practices (like secret settlements) that often fail to protect women or worsen the problem.

@neeratanden @megynkelly If it's an expose that reveals new truths and holds him accountable for what he's done, absolutely.

@phxfloaz Because he used to talk about hating DC!
@ChelaW4315 @TVietor08 Because for a long time, he was indifferent to $. Not implying he doesn't deserve it, etc.
@TVietor08 Yes, and former presidents need room for Secret Service. Bushes bought a Dallas house and then the house next door.
@TVietor08 No, what I mean is that they used to dislike DC (and a lot of what it represented) so much. But like I said, I get the practicalities.
@wefitu12 @JakeSherman Yes, of course, that's the main reason they are staying
@wefitu12 @JakeSherman No, not at all. It's just that they used to dislike DC so strongly. On the house size: ex presidents need big places b/c of Secret Service.
Because they used to dislike DC so much. But former presidents need big spreads b/c of Secret Service. https://t.co/0R6sxXm0rJ
@vplus @JakeSherman Yes. After the presidency, the Bushes bought a place in Dallas and then the place next door!
@teri_atthepaper Not criticizing, just making a biographical observation.
@JakeSherman Former presidents need huge spreads b/c of Secret Service. It's basically impossible for them to live inexpensive lives.
@bcove Former presidents need big spreads because of Secret Service. It's just striking biographically. Wonder what his younger self would think.
@JakeSherman Yup. But after being immersed in his bio/Chicago years, it's striking from a former-community-organizer-who-used-to-not-care-about-money POV

I'm just going to keep asking: is it depressing or poetically just that this is how we're likely to elect our first female president?

Weirdly, one of Clinton's greatest assets tonight was her hard-won knowledge of the dynamics and optics of male sex scandals.
Hillary Clinton has clearly learned a thing or two about handling scandals over male lechery.
Once again @nytimes factcheckers are saying that Clinton basically crushed Trump on accuracy. https://t.co/TJwpWYkL3G
