How to nurture friendship rather than how to network.
How to be alone and competent in solitude...

2018 was a banner year for films. Original, provocative, entertaining, elevated films.		Bohemian Rhapsody and Green Book were not among the best. They're good, maybe better than good, but not great. Certainly not "Best Picture."

When it comes to #immigration, where are we? 		From 1776-1963, 42 million people moved to the US; that includes the Ellis Island era. 		After the 1965 immigration act, 43 million people (of which 11 million are undocumented) migrated to the US.		#DearAmerica @DefineAmerican https://t.co/eu93QsQB4J

@wtf_imtooold Not *the* priority in terms of the conversation leading up to Tuesday. Right now that’s what Trump and #MAGA supporters want to discuss, hence my citing Trump’s tweet.
@wtf_imtooold I think you're misreading me. I'm not bashing Democrats, many of whom are speaking out about immigration. I'm simply pointing out that for Trump and many of his followers, immigration is the No. 1 priority.
@RedwoodGirl I would think not. 	I'm overgeneralizing here, but immigration is THE priority for people who benefit from the fear-mongering and for the people who are directly impacted.
How are progressives and Democrats responding?		By changing the subject.		Will it work? 		I don't know.		What is clear, however, is that while immigration is a motivating factor for #MAGA, it's not a priority for progressives and Democrats.
To @realDonaldTrump and the #MAGA crowd, the danger from "criminal aliens" is THE biggest factor in this election.		And they have an entire media ecosystem––@FoxNews, @BreitbartNews, @DailyCaller, @DRUDGE_REPORT, not to mention conservative talk radio––to @DefineAmerican. https://t.co/jtRxgzWlfv

@JMVockley John! Hope you are well. I think we must re-think our entire immigration enforcement "strategy" not based on what and whom we fear but on why people are coming--the root causes of migration--and what our country needs, and why.
@ToddWatkins16 Actually, this "problem" has been brewing since Bush created DHS, which houses ICE, in the early 2000s after 9/11. Before ICE, we had INS

So much to unpack in this tweet, chief of which is how everyone––journalists included––have fallen into the right-wing news ecosystem, in which what happens and why it happened is less important than how the organized right reacts to it. 👇🏽 https://t.co/gksehrk1ka
@AndrewKirell My purpose was not to deceive or mislead. And as someone who regularly gets attacked online by the right, I am curious as to why are you falling for right-wing radio and TV hosts who are using the photo to dismiss the moral outrage happening at the border?
I am not apologizing or deleting the image. Because of the intent of the protest, what Leroy said, and what I personally experienced in that jail cell, as a journalist who happens to be undocumented.
When I found out where the photo was from––a protest in Dallas–– I contacted one of the organizers, Leroy Peña, who is from the Apache tribe. Leroy told me on the phone: "It was a stage demonstration. The actual thing is way, way worse than we were depicting."
.@AndrewKirell, a few things: look at my original tweet. I didn't say where the photo was from b/c at the time I didn't know. I asked. What I do ***know*** is, when I was arrested in Texas in 2014, I shared a jail cell w/ boys ages 5 to 14. Boys who looked like that boy. https://t.co/hhkEwsLWUd

@CourtneyOrtner @SocialSecurity I think the more important question is, why are people moving? Why did your ancestors move? did they need visas and green cards? You think people move here so you can call them criminals?
@CourtneyOrtner @SocialSecurity No. To be in the country illegally is not a crime; it’s a civil offense. I am here illegally without authorization. But I am not illegal because people can’t be illegal.
@missolivee Ay naku. It’s not about me at all. It’s about what they don’t know; to many, it’s about what they don’t want to know.
@BBBDoorsRoderic @mishacollins @laurenevemay Hi, I am offended by these assumptions and mischarectizations. Especially since I witnessed kids being locked up when I shared a jail cell with little boys in Texas in 2014 when way less people were outraged

@jaisjoy22 No apologies needed. Let’s just not fall into the “fake news” trap and the partisan, positioning. Both parties have enabled this. It’s a bipartisan mess, from Clinton, Bush, Obama all the way to Trump.
@jaisjoy22 The photo is not "fake." The photo, I found out, was taken at a protest where they staged the detention of kids. "The actual thing is way, way worse than we were depicting," Leroy Pena, one of the organizers of the protest, told me yesterday.
Dear @Twitter:	Read my very first tweet about this carefully. The U.S. government’s treatment of children is the culmination of the anti-immigrant hate enabled by right-wing “news” sites, and the kind of hateful language that is all too common on this very platform. 👇🏽 https://t.co/nZqu9246Yw
Telling me that I shouldn’t post an image that, as it happened, was from a protest that staged what is actually happening at the border is like saying actors shouldn’t portray characters and situations based in real life. This is not a “cause” for me. This is real. https://t.co/PbOTmYdjiZ
@Amylia403 @mishacollins @laurenevemay I learned that the photo was from a protest in which they staged what is happening in real life. I know this fact b/c I was there; I was jailed with those kids. So what is the misrepresentation?
also, @mishacollins, for people like me whose lives are in direct danger of being detained and deported, both sides, both parties, have hurt us. Trump is the culmination of what President Bush and President Obama started. 2/2 https://t.co/bZnQfasYrP
.@mishacollins, I shared that image bc when I was detained in TX in 2014—before anti-Trump resisters were outraged by locking up kids—I shared a jail cell w/ boys that age. I was there. I never said where this image was from; I asked where it was from. 1/2 https://t.co/bZnQfasYrP
@will_hom Just curious, where in my post did I say where the image was from. I didn’t source it bc I didn’t know; I asked who the source was. But what I do know, since I was shared a cell jail with kids who were locked up in 2014, is that this happened and is happening
These photos are from 2014, one from 2018. These photos inspired art and protest and moral outrage. Outrage. These photos cannot @DefineAmerican.
Migration is a natural human right: what white people throughout history called Manifest Destiny” and “White Man’s Burden,” what led to US foreign and economic policies.  But when people of color move, it’s treated like a crime and kids aren’t treated as kids. https://t.co/s8U3tmrnAI
@HunterFollett63 One of us is a long-time reporter. And one of us got locked up in a cell with kids, where I saw first-hand young boys detained and jailed. That was in 2014 when Obama was president. That's why I shared the image while I looked for the source. This was happening. This is happening
@rebel19 I cannot.
.@MarkSKrikorian, a few things: 	1) I didn't staged that photo. 	2) I shared it bc when I was detained in 2014 I shared a jail cell with boys as young as that kid. 	3) My journalistic work speaks for itself.

Intersectionality is more than a concept––it’s a necessary practice and the only way forward. 		Immigrant rights are human rights, and we cannot discuss the rights of immigrants without connecting it to #BlackLivesMatter and the rights of Native Americans.

I don't use Facebook for games; I don't look at ads. I use FB to connect with my mother, whom I haven't seen in person in 25 years. I am grateful that I get to connect w/ Mama for free. It also makes me depress.		Technology is mostly borderless. 		Borders separate Mama and me.
Facebook, Twitter, Google––especially Facebook, an unprecedented directory of people––have a lot to answer for. A whole lot.		But we, as individual users, must also carry our weight and own up to our responsibilities.

@KPav That is wonderful.
@KPav They’re all teenagers, most HS students. They don’t really know what “news” is. They get “news” from “the media”
@SoccerLimey Too many people want to be “news media personalities” and “talking heads.” We need journalists committed to journalism.
@KPav I thought about that. Then I talked to my nieces and nephews who live in the digital engagement media space
@SoccerLimey I think everything is “the media” but not everything is “journalism.” Unpacking the meaning of “news media,” to me, is the biggest challenge
There’s “the media.” There’s “the news media.” Then there’s “journalism.”	Who is teaching our kids—not to mention adults—about the crucial  yet overlooked distinction among them? #medialiteracy

good night tweeps, gotta finish writing this book.
"instant citizenship"?		What is that?		FYI, I've lived in the US for almost 25 years; I'm an entrepreneur who employs US citizens, have paid so much taxes I should be a Republican. But my merits and my $ aside, how many years should I wait? Are you more worthy than I am? https://t.co/B4EmtgzIVl
The 10-year ban, as it would apply to me, is courtesy of President Clinton and the GOP-led Congress in 1996.... https://t.co/lz62CoL9pO
@Munozie28 yep, a civil violation. the problem is we've equated the action with "criminality" as if immigrants are "criminals"
being in the country illegally is not a crime; it's a civil offense, and I am not a criminal.		good night. https://t.co/KfcYPMtlZg
immigration is NOT a one-size-fits-all process. it's not a drive-thru lane, not like ordering Starbucks. 		this is why I can't just "get legal": https://t.co/R3UpTS9a9L #factsmatter https://t.co/LPlUYml1lS
Here's the answer: https://t.co/W5nn6NuXEr via @DOCUMENTEDfilm https://t.co/GolFkZybxo
Millions of undocumented Americans are looking to adjust our status, “get legal” and become citizens. Can you point us to the system you know of? https://t.co/eWLdfwTMLI
@Astrid_NV 😍
w/ notable exceptions (and big shout-out to journalists who do commendable work), the news media, particularly on TV, has failed us when it comes to reporting FACTS and PROCESS on all things immigration 👇🏽 https://t.co/mtV1HVZ76Z
If I had a process to follow to legalize my status and become a citizen, I would have followed it by now. And so would millions of others. Save from leaving the US, where I’ve lived for 25 years, and accepting a 10-year bar before being able to come back, there is no process 👇🏽 https://t.co/mijwP5NHam

A president who benefited from chain migration—before green cards and visas, Ellis Island was a symbol of chain migration—now wants to end it.	Not b/c immigrants bring violence. (Untrue.)

@RepGutierrez @senorrinhatch @SenatorDurbin So how can we change the culture in which way we––and by we, I mean every single American––understand #DACA, #DREAMAct and #immigration, so we can find a real political solution? Because what is at stake is more than papers and laws. What’s at stake is how we @DefineAmerican. https://t.co/W4R7zCugcm
@RepGutierrez @senorrinhatch @SenatorDurbin If Congress does not come up with a permanent legislative solution, nearly 800,000 undocumented Americans who are currently employed and are part of the American workforce would lose their work authorization. They could be fired over the course of two years.
@RepGutierrez @senorrinhatch @SenatorDurbin Every day that Congress fails to act, 122 DREAMers w/ DACA will lose their status. If Congress does not come up with a permanent legislative solution by March 5, an estimated 7,700 DREAMers will lose their jobs every single business day between March 6 and November 6, 2018.
@RepGutierrez @senorrinhatch @SenatorDurbin And all of us DREAMers live in a crucible wrapped by contradiction. We know our lives are more than pieces of papers; we know our lives cannot be be merely measured by laws. Yet we know all too well that our lives are limited by papers we don’t have and laws that haven’t passed.
@RepGutierrez @senorrinhatch @SenatorDurbin And all of us DREAMers—at schools, at work, in our chosen professions and passions, whatever they may be—are a part of America. Whether you like or not, whether you know it or not, we are members of your communities. We are a part of this country.
@RepGutierrez @senorrinhatch @SenatorDurbin I was a dreamer before being a DREAMer—before coming out about your undocumented status––became a politicized identity. For more than a decade, I was in the closet about my undocumented status while building a career as a journalist. My goal: I wanted to write my way into America
I was a dreamer before the DREAM Act was introduced in 2001, first by @RepGutierrez in the House, then by the @SenOrrinHatch and @SenatorDurbin in the Senate. For 16 years now, several bills have been introduced, the eligibility requirements have changed, etc.
I was a dreamer before there was a DREAM Act, before there was DACA (I missed the age cut-off by 4 months), before social media (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube) allowed us to see each other and form communities, online and off
A thread on all things #DACA, #DREAMAct and #immigration. From a DREAMer and a dreamer (h/t MLK).
@DefineAmerican And Congressional Republicans: I hope y'all are watching very carefully. DREAMers are not owned by Democrats, nor do they want to be. This is a time to SHOW (not tell, but SHOW) that the party of Lincoln is NOT anti-immigrant, that y'all don't side w/ @SteveKingIA, et al.
Dear Congressional Democrats:		Can you show as much courage and fearlessness that DREAMers exhibit every day––at school, at work, in our communities?		Can you?		#DreamActNow @DefineAmerican
