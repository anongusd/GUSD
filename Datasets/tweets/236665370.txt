@MeddlinMegs @hastingsdude @MakahaMelody @Peggynoonannyc Okay, fine. My only point, the only point that mattered, was that 45 wasn't spinning urban legends in his speech; he was more or less trafficking in fact-checkable facts, when he wasn't simply advancing opinions, arguments, values and themes. Yeah, he didn't shiznit or bullsnit.
@MeddlinMegs And THAT's why it was so important for Colt 45 to spell things out so explicitly: to combat widespread American and global public ignorance about the give and take between Nuncle Sambo and the NATOnics.
Megs, suffice it to say I don't in any way disagree with your personal perception of the relationship between U.S and NATO; on the other hand, your notion that most people understand what you and I both grasp as the truth isn't al all warranted – most think U.S. is NATO-dependent https://t.co/p2uwf9Lhr8

@MeddlinMegs @hastingsdude @MakahaMelody @Peggynoonannyc That's as may be. Point is, in general, the speech was marked by factual truths where there weren't simply opinions or arguments. It's in no way accurate or fair to describe his speech as either insubstantial or false. You may or may not agree with his themes, but he didn't fib.

How sad? Alex Jones is, or, at least, was, in the past, full of shit, if not out-and-out unhinged, which is the very charge you're implicitly leveling against 45; in which case, how is an Alex-Jones-based metaphor in any way unwarranted, inapt or unfair?

@MeddlinMegs Clearly, many people DON'T know that our military's the best, believing, for instance, we depend upon NATO – rather than the reality, which is that NATO depends upon us. People also think we lost in Vietnam &amp; Afghanistan because of impotence rather than lack of political resolve

@Bidisha_online Funny thing is, the UK, or, rather, HM's Kingdom, has existed for most of its nearly 1000 years outside of any EU and with apparently little lost from that lack of association, so one wonders why now, in 2019, EU membership is of such paramount &amp; pressing concern. Anyone explain?

@aphraswife @TheAtlantic @MisterAlexFren1 @maxapotter If you feel there's a better &amp; more potent system of justice than what's in the U.S. &amp; its 50 constituent states, then, I say, why not deport yourself &amp; go live in that far countree &amp; live the happier &amp; more-fulfilled life you so richly deserve? Canada? UK? Sudan? Get thee gone!
@aphraswife @TheAtlantic @MisterAlexFren1 @maxapotter If that's the case, that's an issue for the 50 states and the fed gov't to deal with; this is a civic and constitutional matter, for voters and lawyers and lawmakers to deal with. If changes are in order, then let them be made the proper way! Meanwhile, mind your own biscuits!
@aphraswife @TheAtlantic @MisterAlexFren1 @maxapotter That's the business of prosecutors, defenders, juries and courts; and not of you or me or any other nosey, meddling, hand-wringing, interloping, virtue-signaling peckerwood in America or the rest of the world. Mind your own biscuits and leave legal biscuits to legal personages!
@aphraswife @TheAtlantic @MisterAlexFren1 @maxapotter Then, sweet Jesus, let that be worked out in courts of law! As I very, very explicitly said – if you'd bothered to read my words – I said, let justice be done! I'm not talking about such real harms, I'm talking about the shark-jumping #MeToo movement infecting perception of gays.

@wardthomasmusic @bbcradioulster When will Ward Thomas tour outside of the UK, say, elsewhere in Europe, say, Portugal, or, say, the U.S.? Is that in the cards right now?
@WashTimes Just too frickin funny. These two are basically mafia chieftains, the heads of their respective families, and they're in the midst of a go-to-the-mattresses gangland war; Pelosi makes a power move against Trump with the SOTU business, then Trump hits back on the plane. Priceless!

@CBSNews Does raise a good point: Aeroplanes've existed since December 17th, 1903 – if not, conspiratorially, prior to that date – and the U.S. Congress has had ample opportunity over the past 115-116 years to create its own personal air-transport service, but has pointedly not done so.

@cykelly1718 A wee bit dramatic, Lady Olivier. Why on Earth would anyone need to die for intelligent, well-educated and well-informed people with good taste and minute perception to enter into a discussion about admirable versus risible online behavior?  What's so special about your ellipses?
@washingtonpost @jrezaian First knew about this story because of a crazy, punkin', kitchen-disruptive, formerly drug-using &amp; still-boozing food anthropologist, super-talented writer, Ramones fan &amp; relentless, tats-acquiring, aging hipster by name of Anthony Bourdain, formerly of the Travel Channel &amp; CNN.

@cykelly1718 Obviously my point, as I set forth above, that people in this Internet Age feel compelled to act out, to be aggressively histrionic to the extent they take the trouble to spell out for strangers across the Web what physical things they're doing, such as "lol," "yawn," "sigh," etc
@hyperanomalous I guess I'm a show-businessman at heart, on the model of Steven Spielberg, who, even if he's making a movie about the Holocaust or D-Day, nevertheless manages to tease out some version of a happy ending, which he knows will hook audiences and keep 'em coming back for more horror.
@MaajidNawaz Hmm. Yeah.

@hyperanomalous Yeah. Though, in the end, it kinda blew up in his face &amp; in the faces of his wife and children. He probably shoulda retired a little earlier &amp; headed out for, say, Cambodia, to live out the rest of his days and enjoy his ill-gotten gains and the attentions of the local womenship.
@TheAtlantic @sarahzhang In other words, Sarah Zhang, at The Atlantic, Trump is . . .  just like the other 44 presidents who preceded him. My, what a revelation!

@KDRogersMD You have said literally nothing to refute the overwhelming consensus among scholars that Jesus Christ was a real person who actually lived. You just aren't dealing with this reality.
@KDRogersMD If you see things that way, then it merely reflects your lack of proper education. That's not a problem for the Bible; it's a problem for you.
@KDRogersMD There's good reason to believe that Jesus Christ was born during lambing season, in the spring, as many, many scholars more intelligent and better educated than you are aware. And whydo birth and death dates matter when there is evidence of his real existence?
@KDRogersMD Who cares whether YOU can confirm it. Other people, more intelligent and better educated than you, have already confirmed it. Why is YOUR role in this question so very important?
@KDRogersMD But how is any of that relevant to the historical record, the fact that history records the words of men who knew Jesus Christ? Are you simply avoiding this issue because you don't want to have to deal with it or think about it?
@KDRogersMD You seem to be confusing so many different, disparate elements  – you really do seem confused. Perhaps a little too much talking without a sufficient about of thought beforehand.
@KDRogersMD Again, what does any of that matter – how is any of that relevant to the fundamental, underlying historical record? Please don't avoid discussing this, although it may be more enjoyable for you to deploy your musings about mythology, Oriental religions, etc.
@KDRogersMD You seem to be confusing two entirely different concepts or phenomena. (1) The historical record, versus (2) posterior embellishments to the historical record. Am I wrong? And the fact that any given thing is problematic – how does that negate the underlying historical record?
@KDRogersMD Wait a minute. You're saying there was no historical Jesus of Nazareth? Kindly clarify or elucidate. Thank you.
@KDRogersMD Um . . .  what do you mean by "fictional"?

@justjanedoee @defacedwallop Christ did say (Mark 10:25) "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God." – yes, about wealth-love but also arguably love of anything earthly, like sex unconnected to procreation, such as . . . homosexuality.

@AndrewDeiner @Alyssa_Milano @iamcardib What? What are you nattering about? Does your wife put up with that?
@cykelly1718 Huh. Even weaker than "lol" or "rotflmao." How weird that people on the internet want to represent involuntary things like yawning and laughter in such a formal, deliberate and contrived manner, even after they become adults. The last adult generation was the WWII set, I think.
@AndrewDeiner @Alyssa_Milano @iamcardib You know about my money? How is that?

@vermindust I didn't make an issue of his intended meaning, which is perfectly clear to any literate and educated person, but thanks all the same!

@JP1958S @davidfrum Excuse me: Both my Naval parents and my Air Force sister served with NATO, in the 60s and 80s, respectively, so have the modesty not to presume what I do or do not understand. The very simple reality is, most Western European countries are not prepared for national defense.
@JP1958S @davidfrum Not sure what your source of info is, but what you've said is precisely the polar opposite of the case. The strength of NATO's almost entirely predicated upon the military prowess and economic resources of the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, the UK. All other partners are adjuncts.

@RParagliding Certainly not in the way a professional civil servant does. What he does have, like almost every president before him, is strong intuition and common sense. He knows, for example, a strong economy, a strong and growing military, and a restrained Supreme Court are all good things.
@RParagliding @davidfrum What politicians are NOT kleptocrats &amp; corrupt as smoke-inhaling lungs? The notion that Republicans put Democrats to shame in matters of venality is one of the great political fantasies of the left. Look at the Clintons, Obamas, Carters, Kennedys – all serpents licking the dust.
@RParagliding I don't necessarily advocate leaving NATO myself. My naval father served with NATO in the 60s, and my airman sister did the same in the 80s, so I have a keen appreciation for NATO's role in this world. I'm merely saying that Trump's belief the U.S. should exit isn't irrational.
@RParagliding @davidfrum A majority of Americans have a broad spectrum of delusions, owing to their lack of reliance on their own intellect and judgment in deference to the opinions of journalists, 85-95% of whom are Democrats, liberals, progressives or socialists and advocate for only one party's goals.
@RParagliding @davidfrum Yep.
@RParagliding @davidfrum Two things: (1) NATO was, as much as anything, part of the Marshall Plan, a goodwill policy aimed at strengthening European stability, prosperity &amp; civic morale.  (2) The U.S. certainly did use the alliance to its advantage as part of its plan for deployment of strategic weapons.
@RParagliding @davidfrum You're deploying a paper tiger of an argument. No one credibly thinks that Trump takes marching orders from Putin; that's leftist fantasy fueled by airport fiction. What Trump hates is European lack of seriousness about defense spending, which is why he feels that NATO's a joke.
@RParagliding @davidfrum NATO is largely a relic of the Cold War. It was repurposed for the post-9/11 era, but the U.S. with the UK, still does the heavy lifting, with the Belgiums and the Denmarks serving in adjunct roles. Either the U.S. alone deters Putin's ambition, or there's no deterrence at all.
@RParagliding @davidfrum I don't disagree with anything you've said here. Yes, a country of 325 million people with an unrivalled powerhouse of a capitalist economy and that chooses to divert an unusually high percentage of resources to defense obviously trumps small countries who aren't defense-minded.
@ImpeachBDevos Hmm. That's quite a feat of engineering. Apparently an engineering degree pays off in spades. But all that math and science you need . . .  sheesh!

@RParagliding @davidfrum Treasonous? There ya go with the showboating again. Can you stop virtue-signaling for, like, even a millisecond? What success the alliance has is owing to the prowess of the U.S. &amp; secondarily of the UK. All other nations are ancillary and largely symbolic in their participation.
@RParagliding @davidfrum I don't question the skills, merit or valor of any given person serving in any given Western European military organization; what I'm quite explicitly talking about is the capacity of any Western European nation, other than the UK, to wage war in a meaningful way, à la the U.S.

@davidfrum One of the fascinating political questions of our times is: Between the dispossessed Reaganite conservatives and the dispossessed neoconservatives, which eunuch faction of conservatism is more peevish, resentful, spiteful and vindictive regarding the ascension of Donald J. Trump?

@davidfrum @ConanOBrien How many late-night hosts are Harvard graduates?

But how often do their resumes show attendance at Ivy League schools? Never?

@BenjySarlin Let's be clear: William F. Buckley, who largely invented the modern conservative Republican movement in the 50s through the 80s, made it a top priority to scour his party of Jew-haters and succeeded. What McCarthy's doing with King is enforcing the Buckley doctrine. That's all.

@kinagrannis Yes, pretty – what's the song? Oh, hey, kina, I wanted t'put a coupla songs in your ear, in case you like 'em and feel you might wanna cover 'em. They're https://t.co/ogs5o0idQk and https://t.co/nC2wFl2UY2  I don't have great grasp of your style, but these two seemed maybe right.
@FreddyK15503588 @GirlGibraltar Oh, okay, thanks, Fred. Sorry to hear about the estrangement. Oh, well, she seems positive enough online and seems to have interesting things to talk about and to share with everyone. Thanks again.
@kinagrannis Okay, there ya go, kina: four broad categories of wimmins' country music tracking back to the 1950s, with Patsy, right on up to 2018 and '19, with Kacey, First Aid Kit and Ward Thomas. I didn't give you a single bum lead – all of these women have an array of outstanding songs.

@hyperanomalous Lol!

@NotWhoYouThunk @AOC @ebruenig I can believe it.

@BenTroppo That'd seem to be the case. The notion that differences between the sexes are mere social constructs is Dungeons-And-Dragons-grade fantasy. Hormonal differences alone, as I'm sure you well know, account for acres of daylight between male and female emotions and behavior. Crazy!

@marybar41015771 If it were just me, I'd literally hate The Book Of Mormon, Spamelot and The Producers, not to mention West Side Story, South Pacific, Camelot, Guys and Dolls, Grease &amp; The Rocky Horror Show. That "Hamilton" smells funny to me is not for nothing; my taste is consistently reliable.
@marybar41015771 I'm an expat Amurricun, born in Biloxi, Mississippi, USA, raised in Ireland and Portugal, who now lives in the Azores. I'm probably about 1001% more American than 49% of peeps living in the States in 2019. I also like quality musicals, but I have a bad feeling about this one.

Not organic.

@thehill Is it just me, or does anyone else feel that maybe this is a musical you can go the rest of your life without seeing? Something just smells off about this one. Way different vibe from with The Book Of Mormon, Spamelot or The Producers. I probably couldn't afford it anyway.

@Karesh_Alter If you're advising me to seek therapy, then, yes, for all practical purposes, you ARE posing as an expert. If you're not one, then have the intellectual &amp; moral self-respect to refrain from a mental-health narrative to attack me. Just call me a  c@%t,  a f@#$%t  or a  n@#$%r !

@hyperanomalous If I recall, much of Conrad's style's attributable to Polish's being his first language &amp; the consequent reality that he thought in Polish, then translated everything into English. Yes, he's definitely slow reading, but, in the end, what power and what ideas and what characters!

@hyperanomalous Burton's basically Arabic fairy tales and the like, Sinbad, etc. De Maupassant and Henry specialize in stories with a twist or surprise ending. Good examples are De Maupassant's "The Necklace" and Henry's "The Gift Of The Magi," both of which, for all I know, you've already read.
@hyperanomalous It's a little bit funny, because the only thing I've read by Conrad is Heart Of Darkness, but that's enough to give me a thorough sense of his personality. I know, of course, about Lord Jim, Nostromo, etc., just've never read 'em. But, yeah, his text is so dense &amp; complex, huh?

@hyperanomalous When I think of ripping yarns à la Burton, de Maupassant &amp; Henry, my mind doesn't immediately go to Conrad too. He strikes me as brooding, deeply reflective &amp; relentlessly philosophical. As for Vonnegut, I know he's esteemed, but, honestly, I know little of him or of his work.
@LuLucy8 @ChrisMurphyCT Anyone who reads or watches the news knows that much. The issue isn't any failure by anyone to recognize that problem but rather how to address the problem. Obviously you believe that taking guns from law-abiding citizens helps to solve the problem; while I don't remotely agree.
@LuLucy8 @ChrisMurphyCT What do you want me to say about children? That harm to them, or their deaths are horrible? I doubt that daylight between you &amp; me lies in whether or not we consider that to be horrible but rather in whether we agree taking guns away from law-abiding citizens solves the problem.
@LuLucy8 @ChrisMurphyCT What? Yes! I pointed my finger at Chicago because it has egregious numbers of murders committed by criminals against other criminals. How does that translate to hate? Do you really think you're doing yourself any favors by doubling down on this notion? Ridiculous! Focus on logic.
@LuLucy8 @ChrisMurphyCT Lol! Chicago hating? What on Earth is that supposed to mean? Under what framework of reason do you interpret anything I've said to mean THAT? Now you've simply managed to compromise your own general credibility; what does it matter what you have to say about anything whatsoever?
@LuLucy8 @ChrisMurphyCT I oppose criminals with guns, as seen on a vast scale in Chicago &amp; elsewhere, and I advocate for their imprisonment or execution, as the case may be. As for law-abiding citizens, I support their right to own guns as good as any criminal has. Plus, the 2nd Amendment requires this.

@hyperanomalous Maybe, but seems awfully late in the game in this world for significant numbers of viewers and critics to be objecting on that basis. It's not 1954 or even 1963 – it's 2019, and I think that the bulk of people've evolved beyond that point. Black with white is no longer a novelty.
@hyperanomalous Thanks for your feedback. I guess I ought to see it on Netflix and judge for myself. Yeah, could be some people critical for the reason you state, but I know for a fact that the partly Hispanic critic of deepfocuslens doesn't have that mindset. She's like a film-school professor.
@washingtonpost FYI, according to deepfocuslens, of YouTube, this movie is supposed to be simply awful and laughable in its direction, writing and acting. I haven't seen it myself, so I can't say for sure, but consider yourself warned.

@davidfrum What's remarkable? It's not like you haven't been aware for at least three years of what kind of person Trump is: trolling, provocative. contrarian, defiant &amp; arrogant. This kind of ostentatious pearls-clutching, David, doesn't jibe with the deliberate demeanor of a speech writer

@RitaPanahi Rita, I'll grant she's one of the most provocatively sexy women in the world, but sexy ≠ classy, an example of bathetic reality that's truly unfortunate. Hollywood primes us to believe that sexy people are inherently, naturally also classy, but this is largely cinematic fiction.

@nytopinion @nytdavidbrooks Unprecedented, NYT Opinion? As in, worse than in 1860? Um . . .  okay. Thanks for the history lesson? I think?

@PaigeBTurnin @davidfrum Ah, well said and unbearably pithy! You've managed to channel – simultaneously – both Oscar Wilde and Tallulah Bankhead. Well done! I'm always jealous of your kind of wit, linguistic talent and verbal dexterity.
@PaigeBTurnin I really have no choice but to interpret your response as an indication you've misunderstood my comment.
@PaigeBTurnin @davidfrum Oh, madam, it was not I who gave Portugal a bad name. That particular narrative began in the early 15th century. Give blame where blame is due, and flatter me not with specious accusations of villainy. In any event, I am but a wretched American expatriated to these shores.

@LotusB10 @PenguinUKBooks @scarcurtis Yeah, I'm not a fan of the cosmetic surgery. Gives me the willies.
@ImmaBioloG Okay, night!
@ImmaBioloG Tamales rock. A sister and her daughter, my niece, once threw a tamale-making party. It was fun, and the results were of course delicious.
@ImmaBioloG Books are good. YouTube is sort of a supplement to books, for me. Oh, yeah, is she cute? Or just charming? Or charismatic? I've fallen for people at work before, and a couple or three times I ended up letting them know, and that, trust me, was never a good idea. Never ended well.
@ImmaBioloG Love me some Reese. Love me some Shelby. Hearts in eyes til the cows come home.
@ImmaBioloG Lol, shucks.  :-D
@ImmaBioloG I love her recipes. She makes tamales every Christmas. She just did one this Christmas on tamales w/ queso Oaxaca &amp; cotija cheese with roasted peppers.  :-d  She did another one about Mexican wedding cookies. She's a great cook, great presenter of recipes, and super charming.
@ImmaBioloG Yeah, just about anything you might be interested in. It's a library.
@ImmaBioloG Lol.
@ImmaBioloG Me too. But I'm an even bigger fan of Reese Witherspoon, which is probably the main reason I saw it three times the weekend it opened. Hearts in eyes. Shelby Lynne was in it too – she played his mama. Even bigger hearts in eyes. Shelby Lynne is a Valkyrie from Southern Alabama..
@ImmaBioloG Mexico! Oh, there's a YouTuber named Johanna who's, like, half Mexican and half white-bread, her husband is Vietnamese, and she cooks Mexican, Vietnamese &amp; other Asian and then just garden-variety, white-bread American food like fried chicken. She is just awesome. And very sweet.
@formarrowdbs @BreitbartNews It's just a lazy move. Like, someone gets tired of arguing and wants to wrap up, so the go-to move is, just bring up Hitler or Nazis or the Third Reich or what have you, and that brings the whole conversation to a crashing halt. It's such a move of supreme douchebagery. Pathetic.
@ImmaBioloG Yep, I'm a Major-League YouTube-watcher. Music, recipes, politics, religion, you name it.
@ImmaBioloG No like Beatles? Or no like puns? lol
@ImmaBioloG Yeah, love that movie. Favorite scene is when Joaquin and Reese sing "It Ain't Me Babe," by Bob Dylan. Fantastic!
@ImmaBioloG Where in the world are you right now, then?
@ImmaBioloG The thread's just a blur in my memory. I was tweeting hard &amp; fast to keep up with all the incoming. I did maintain my composure, however, and managed to uphold grammar, spelling, punctuation &amp; decent style. I also feel I gave as good as I got. Like Tom Petty, I didn't back down.
@ImmaBioloG Lol. I thought of last meals probably because of those YouTube pieces about crazy last meals that various prisoners have requested over the years, like serial killers and whatnot.
@ImmaBioloG Me too. Love me some Beat-les.
@ImmaBioloG I'm sure she does play there often, as I believe she lives there with her husband. I know her entirely from YouTube. I know a lot about Nashville cuz I'm a hardcore country &amp; alt-country &amp; Americana fan. I'm the guy who saw Walk The Line, like, three times the weekend it came out
@ImmaBioloG I don't really remember any points whatsoever. Mostly it seemed like ad hominems and insults and ridicule and that sort of thing. A real snarkfest. I did try my best, however, to give each aggressive tweet a decently thought-out answer. I had to type pretty darn fast to keep up.
@ImmaBioloG Oh, yeah, yaki udon with beef and a glass of Malbec – you could do way worse for a last prison meal.
@ImmaBioloG Not sure if you like country, but if in Nashville you should know about Mickey Guyton. She's spectacular. A black woman who's, like, totally a mainstream country singer, with the hair, nails, makeup &amp; dresses, but she also channels blues &amp; R&amp;B. She puts little hearts in my eyes.
@ImmaBioloG Oh, man, after I tweeted about Frum, within, like, less than a minute there was a first wave of maybe fifty-nine notifications, every one of them hopping mad I had dared to diss Frum. It was like Frum had dozens of mothers coming to his defense and rescue. Kee-rayzee! It was fun.
@ImmaBioloG Yeah. The old-school pro sushi chefs are supposed to be trained so well that foodborne illness just isn't an issue, but I guess the problem is, not every sushi chef is one of THEM. My favorite Japanese food is yaki udon w/ beef, which cries out for glasses of Malbec to wash down.
@LotusB10 @PenguinUKBooks @scarcurtis Beauty seems to be the special burden and plight of women worldwide.
@secretdorkgirl @davidfrum I'd say there's about 1001 more pressing problems in the world than Donald Trump. One million Muslims in relocation camps in China being systematically de-Islamicized come to mind, for openers . . .  and it just goes from there. Trump isn't a problem. The world, however, is one.
@ImmaBioloG Glad to hear it.
@ImmaBioloG I think there's probably good BBQ in Nashville too. There's also some hoity toity nouvelle Southern restaurant around there whose chef was featured on Martha Stewart back in the day making her haute cuisine version of chicken and dumplings.
@ImmaBioloG Lol. It was ugly for a while. But I answered every tweet. Every one.
@ImmaBioloG Frum was a speechwriter for W. Bush and in those days, as a neoconservative, he would've been vilified by the left and the media, but in these Trumpian days, neoconservatives are the new BFFs of the left and the media. Politics, of course, obviously makes for strange bedfellows.
@ImmaBioloG I pretty much like any cuisine from anywhere in the world you can imagine. The only food I'm a little lukewarm about is Japanese. Everything Japanese always seems prissy, antiseptic or weird, and that seems to go for their food too. I like sushi just fine and tempura too, though.
@ImmaBioloG Yeah, I maybe parse food meaning a little too closely.
@LotusB10 @PenguinUKBooks @scarcurtis @Twitter @rachelhunterx Right, it's hard to object when it's medically necessary. But a little frightening when people who don't have to get it still choose to do so.
@ImmaBioloG Yeah, my guess is that Nashville foodwise can hold its own with Atlanta, Charleston, Savannah or New Orleans.
@ImmaBioloG It was out and out crazy for like an hour or so. A little scary too. My first time in a tweet storm, let alone one that I had started.
@ImmaBioloG Oh, well, I saw that David Frum had said something snarky about Trump, so I tweeted about Frum being an alumnus of Yale, Harvard, the White House and the Atlantic and would therefore seem to be above such Twitter trolling. Instantly I was hit with 1001 replies from angry peeps.
@ImmaBioloG You said it. The ultimate lazy move.
@ImmaBioloG I feel the same way about people who turn their noses up at pinto beans and insist on only black beans when they go to a Mexican restaurant. Clearly pinto beans versus black beans means something cultural to those people, and I don't trust their black beans proclivity.
@LotusB10 @PenguinUKBooks @scarcurtis @Twitter @rachelhunterx Asian women do seem to take beauty products to the next level in a way that Western women could never have imagined.
@ImmaBioloG Well, be sure and explore Nashville and have some Nashville hot fried chicken at one of the original restaurants there.
@ImmaBioloG When people get tired of arguing after 15 or 20 minutes, one of 'em just brings up Hitler or Nazis and that brings everything to a halt. It's the go-to rhetorical move of our times.
@ImmaBioloG Hey, do you know I started a tweet storm in the Twitterverse today?
@ImmaBioloG Yeah, I know, I'm triggered by kale – what am I gonna do?
@BreitbartNews Well, that's innovative – gotta give'm that much.
Well, that's innovative – gotta give'm that much. https://t.co/bFdGTJGD1G
@ImmaBioloG I'm guessing that someone else is doing the driving and you get to just relax as a passenger.
@ImmaBioloG Yeah, I guess, and to each her own. Kale just seems like a dude who was never in the Marines or a sailor on a ship but still feels the need to get tons &amp; tons of tattoos, to assert his hipness before all the world. I just don't trust kale and don't like what it seems to represent
@LotusB10 @PenguinUKBooks @scarcurtis @Twitter Well, Crazy Rich Asians would make you think they're all perfect 10s, lol.
@ImmaBioloG Not a town called Lewisburg, by any chance?
@NowBoaze @davidfrum Yeah. I woulda thought Frum was a little above this sort of thing.
@ImmaBioloG If a Greek restaurant ever served me spanakopita with kale substituted, I'd send it back to the kitchen. And I'll put a hot spinach salad with bacon, hard-cooked eggs, mushrooms, onions and hot honey-mustard dressing up against any salad featuring kale any day of the week.
@ImmaBioloG Oh. Are you staying in the boondocks, then?
@walterolson I think Eliot had a little bit of Tolstoy about her in her capacity to gauge and describe in telling detail diverse personalities and minds. Anna Karenina and Middlemarch always felt like two works that belong side by side on the same shelf.
@LotusB10 @PenguinUKBooks @scarcurtis @Twitter I sincerely hope Singapore never disappears beneath the waves. Too much good food and too many beautiful women to risk that. I bet that the government has enough money to keep building higher and higher.
@ImmaBioloG Apparently many people do – are gaga for it, in fact. I don't object to the flavor, aroma or texture so much as I do its cultural meaning, which is amorphous to me but still seems noisome. I also feel that it appropriates the role of classic spinach. You can get kale in Nashville
@walterolson Oh, yeah? I think Middlemarch is one of the towering novels of all of English literature.

@cmxsprt @davidfrum Destroying the environment is destroying the environment; it is what it is – no two ways about it. But that has nothing to do with how strong the economy is, except perhaps in a philosophical or moral sense. Wealth &amp; success, unfortunately, don't care about wolves &amp; spotted owls.
@cmxsprt @davidfrum Yes, wealthy trash, which actually describes quite a lot of the wealthy in America.
@cmxsprt @davidfrum Not quite sure what Obama is. Maybe a patrician-white-trash hybrid. He's certainly bidialectal on a scale never seen in any man, let alone in any politician. He can eat eggs Benedict for breakfast, a chili cheese dog for lunch, coq au vin for dinner and a Hot Pocket before bed.
@cmxsprt @davidfrum If Trump wants to enrich himself, I couldn't care less. Same with Pelosi. What I care about &amp; what animates my vote is (1) a strong economy, (2) a strong and ever-growing military &amp; (3) a Supreme Court that doesn't see itself as a second version of Congress, issuing its own laws.
@cmxsprt @davidfrum I vote. I've also helped out with partisan activity on Election Day. But there's nothing irresponsible about observing that DC's gangland, nor to observe that the UN is virulently anti-Semitic &amp; anti-democratic &amp; filthily, filthily corrupt. Just means I have my ear to the ground.
@Trippy4L @TheKitchenista Dayum! Now, that's some fine-ass nouvelle Southern cuisine! Is Atlanta replacing New Orleans as the Paris of the Deep South? What wine or wines go with all that grubba, by the way? Sommeliers?

@TruthSeeker801 @ChandaFinch @SweetGeekling @davidfrum As you apparently are yourself, given your reluctance to account for the meaning of your words.
@cmxsprt @davidfrum No; it's all water off a duck's back. However corrupt Trump is, he's part and parcel of a world, DC, that's 100% corrupt and has been for the longest time. Trump and Pelosi: They're just the heads of different mafia families, and each wants to rub out the other and seize it all.
@luckythen @davidfrum Yes, you are the very model of a modern . . .  white trash. I guess white trash in the UK is now a thing? Did it spread from America along with McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Hollywood movies and rap music? The Queen must be delighted to know she has subjects such as you and your ilk.
@luckythen @davidfrum John Waters said on the commentary track to A Dirty Shame that Tracey Ullman told him arse basically means  c@#$. Not sure why YOU'D be an authority but not Tracey. Anyway, your general manner seems more American white-trash than merry old England; more New Jersey than Jersey.
@bwindels @davidfrum I imagine that has to be right.
@TruthSeeker801 @ChandaFinch @SweetGeekling @davidfrum My inexperience in life. Huh. I should get you to draft my résumés from now on. I don't know it all; I don't know what you're eating right now, for example. And when you say "obvious disgust," do you mean you think I'm feeling disgust or that you find me disgusting? Confused.
@luckythen @davidfrum You're sharing your income and lifestyle with me because . . .  why? By the way, doesn't arse in the UK just mean  c#$%?  If so, why not just call me THAT and have done with it?
@cmxsprt @davidfrum To be sure, there was a time when mostly only patricians were in a position to access the Oval Office, and they're just brought up poshly, aren't they? I suppose Jackson was the first redneck or white-trash president, and, so, now we have Trump too. Sometimes democracy hurts.
@TruthSeeker801 @ChandaFinch @SweetGeekling @davidfrum Sorry to mansplain, homes, but yer the one who fired off the GIF.
@WC2018BR @davidfrum Você deveria ler os livros, artigos de jornal e discursos políticos de David Frum. Eles são mais dignos do seu tempo.
@TruthSeeker801 @ChandaFinch @SweetGeekling @davidfrum Your choices aren't my fault; if you ate the Frusen Glädjé and now you feel guilty, that's all on you. By the way, GIFs, Eddie Bauer, Nirvana, Quentin Tarantino and the 90s are no longer a thing – just ask yer kids.  lol
@yayneabeba @davidfrum Well, apparently not quite yet.  lol
@yayneabeba @davidfrum Lol. Are you from the South?
@luckythen @davidfrum Yeah, I know, that was autocorrect, and I long ago already called out my own error. Don't be embarrassed, though: Sometimes all of us are a day late and a dollar short. I'm sure you'll find someone else to be useful to, O officious and earnest one! Run along now.

@tommyboy22 @davidfrum Jack in the Box tacos dismay me. Little else. Sorry to exceed your specs; it's up to you, though, to update your OS.
@yayneabeba @davidfrum Right, that's what I mean. Is it like a rave? Did no one think I was cool enough to invite? Did someone think I'd narc out the ecstasy users? Boy, do I feel ostracized, minimized and marginalized! I take this very personally. I guess I'll just go out and throw my own 90s party.
@tommyboy22 @davidfrum Tweety brilliance. Did that make it into the OED this year?
@cmxsprt @davidfrum I never said it's okay for any president. I don't think he should be eating bags full of McDonald's cheeseburgers next to his wife in bed either, but I don't plan his days for him. No one ever thought Trump was anything more than a palooka, but Frum's long enjoyed a posh image.
@yayneabeba @davidfrum What is it with all the GIFs today? Did someone throw a 90s party and no one bothered to invite me? I guess I should go out and buy some new Eddie Bauer clothes, assuming that's coming back too. Maybe we can all have a weekend of Tarantino films. GIFs, Bauer, T. &amp; the 90s abide.

@cmxsprt @davidfrum Criticizing's one thing. That's what you do in books, periodical articles and newspaper opinion-pieces.

If you think my point's unwarranted, wrongheaded, immoral, nihilistic or whatever, then, fine, just say so, but don't say something that purports to be logical or philosophical but that's patently untrue. College didn't teach you to be this way, did it? No way
@RichardPMPfx @davidfrum The presidency'll do just fine without your lying awake at night staring up into the darkness of the universe &amp; fretting about your grandchildren's future. There're more pressing things in this world to be concerned about. Make better use of yer time. You'll thank me &amp; yourself.
@davidfrum Lol, silly me. I meant "meme-ing."
@davidfrum David Frum, tweeting about you &amp; seeing the reaction I provoked, I felt like Capt. Willard marching into Kurtz's compound among the watchful eyes of the Montagnards. Clearly you're well beloved and well protected by the denizens of the Twitterverse. Just awe-inspiring,
Well, THAT was refreshing. Apparently David Frum's like a special-needs child toward whom many Twitteristas have a motherly and mothering and protective instinct.
@welldrawndog @SweetGeekling @davidfrum I imagine Wharton's doing just fine. Why don't you give them a call and check in on them?
@cmxsprt @davidfrum Frum was trolling. I was calling him out for it. No moral equivalency.
@DanHogg1 @davidfrum @realDonaldTrump Some of the inkhorniest of words are quite short. Some of the longest ones, the one from Mary Poppins, for example, are mere child's play. Multisyllabism isn't all it's cracked up to be.
@MiaMiaCuIpa @davidfrum How did I do that? Not to inconvenience you or anything, but can you be bothered with details?
@APRondeau @PhelanBen @davidfrum Sorry, but Paul Rudnick's more than just a movie from '91. He's also Libby Gelman-Waxner. He's also a Broadway playwright. He's many, many things, among them, a beloved American literary figure. My street cred, by the way, comes from Taco Bell bean burritos and Modelo Especial.
@TruthSeeker801 @ChandaFinch @SweetGeekling @davidfrum How am I wasting YOUR time? YOU are the one who took time out of your day to respond to ME.
@DavidLe60561687 @DevonScanlon326 @davidfrum Huh? Was that a poem? I like to think it was.
@V_Mulholland @davidfrum Why? Do you want to ask me out and take me to Musso and Frank for prime rib and dirty martinis?
@DevonScanlon326 @DavidLe60561687 @davidfrum Oh, yeah, thanks.
@DevonScanlon326 @DavidLe60561687 @davidfrum Right. And multiple tweet forms – in fact many more than sonnet forms.
@DrumpfBTrippin @SweetGeekling @davidfrum A GIF? Is it still 1999? Are people still wearing Eddie Bauer? Huh. Okay, thanks for letting me know.
@mwk2244 @davidfrum Frankly I don't lose sleep over what any of the 545 members of the 3 branches of the U.S. government happen to be up to at any given time. I have bigger fish to fry, I like to think.
@DevonScanlon326 @DavidLe60561687 @davidfrum Free-verse poets can rhyme if they so choose, but they obviously choose not too. Picasso could paint a realistic, naturalistic portrait, but he chose not to. Not sure what insights you feel you've afforded me, but clearly you're confident about your achievement, so good for you.
@DavidLe60561687 @DevonScanlon326 @davidfrum I think Twitter, like the sonnet, can bring out the best in us, if only we allow it to and take advantage of its unique properties.
@DrumpfBTrippin @SweetGeekling @davidfrum It does? Guess I'll have to go back to nuance school. Thanks for setting me on the right course.
@RoverIsActive @davidfrum False dilemma. It's nothing more than an observation of a public figure and his behavior on Twitter.
@MiaMiaCuIpa @davidfrum You're the one who gave into the impulse to vent your inner infant. Don't try to shame me when you have behaved in a patently embarrassing and compromising manner.
@PhelanBen @APRondeau @davidfrum A GIF? What is it, like, 1999? Are you still wearing Eddie Bauer, then?
@cmxsprt @davidfrum Twitter is not the focus of criticism. A quick re-read confirms that trolling, snarking and miming are the focus. Re-read. See? How simple is that?
@APRondeau @PhelanBen @davidfrum Their only discontent is the ripoff perpetrated by the Munsters.
@welldrawndog @SweetGeekling @davidfrum I'm sure Wharton is doing just fine. Ask them how they're doing.

@BeverlyCarter56 @davidfrum Yeah, maybe.
@DevonScanlon326 @DavidLe60561687 @davidfrum Are you fragment-shaming? Is that where we are now? The world is now a formal essay, and fragments are ostracized? That's the world we live in now? I was unaware. Thank you for disabusing me of my illusion.
@APRondeau @PhelanBen @davidfrum Certainly hot and fiery enough to merit a reaction from the likes of thee, for what that's worth, which I take it on faith is at least something.
@truthtrumps1 @PJvanMegchelen @davidfrum Right.
@DrumpfBTrippin @SweetGeekling @davidfrum Obligado.
@rhonmhon8 @davidfrum Inasmuch as his tweets are reported slavishly and breathlessly in the Times, the Post and everywhere else, why would any among us be unaware of them? And of course, to be clear, I myself follow him.
@bwindels @davidfrum You're floating the theory that snark came into existence subsequent to Jan. 20, 2017? You may be right, but I'd need to see a study.
@PhelanBen @davidfrum Obligado.
@Mossback @davidfrum Really? There are things in this life that you find to be quaint? Do you use that word when talking to family, friends and colleagues? Like, would you be sitting in a bar having wings and beer and find occasion to use the word "quaint"? Fascinating. Do share.
@A2Mamman @davidfrum It is amazing to see how many people react and respond to him, people you'd imagine could simply not be bothered.
@MiaMiaCuIpa @davidfrum Lol. Don't you have to be at least 13 to be on Twitter? Did the rules change while I was asleep?
@ChandaFinch @SweetGeekling @davidfrum The presidency will do just fine. It's built to last. Don't waste energy wringing your hands over things that founding fathers figured out 230 years ago.
@DevonScanlon326 @effjayarr @davidfrum How a fallacy? I like using words like that too, but you must mean something by them.
@SweetGeekling @davidfrum Oh, I follow him. He tweetbinges like no other. On the other hand he doesn't have the reputation of Yale, Harvard, George W. Bush and The Atlantic to uphold.
@AndrewFmOregon Not sure what you mean, so for the nonce won't respond further.
@effjayarr @davidfrum Well, I think I obviously did have a point, which clearly took with a great many people, given the feedback I'm receiving. It's kind of the old good publicity versus bad publicity thing, isn't it?
@Fdr1942 @davidfrum All right.
@PJvanMegchelen @davidfrum Could be.
@DavidLe60561687 @davidfrum Like a line from a Merchant-Ivory film, spoken perhaps by a character played by Sir Anthony Hopkins. Especially in the 21st century, sounds so pithy and penetrating, and yet we're always left wondering: What the Hell ultimately does it really mean? And still we don't really know.
@PhelanBen @davidfrum Excuse me, but there's nothing humble about my brags; not only are they prideful but they're 100% unironic. The key to living in a glass house, by the way, for those who do, is to build with the same kind of glass as is used in the best automobile windshields. Not so bad then.
@davidfrum Oh, why, thank you.

@sheelgetshyphy @nytopinion I can easily believe that to be true, and, since you're a doctor, I take you at your word about it. But clearly if the uninsured were not using emergency rooms as their healthcare systems, then emergency rooms wouldn't be at all stressed to the extent they are in everyday life.
@sheelgetshyphy @nytopinion That's simply not true. When the uninsured get sick or hurt, they go to the emergency room, for they have literally nowhere else to go. Emergency rooms are the de facto healthcare system for the uninsured. You can read about this in the New York Times, the Washington Post, etc.
@sheelgetshyphy @nytopinion Oh, I've been in emergency rooms myself for legitimate reasons, and I've seen up close how they operate. I've also read about the reality in newspaper articles, which presumably are reliable. And I once lived with a doctor, who explained to me exactly how emergency rooms work.
@sheelgetshyphy @nytopinion Oh, I absolutely disagree with that. Indigent care is a huuuuuuuge part of the reason emergency rooms are backed up. Many, many people, who have no insurance, can only access hospitals through emergency rooms, and the hordes of them overwhelm the system. That's just the reality.
@sheelgetshyphy @nytopinion If there're wait times for things like that in the U.S., that merely reflects, I think, a shortage of specialists in the given area. That's quite a different issue than wait times imposed as a direct consequence of government policy, which is what goes on in the UK and in Canada.
@Dannymako @Tweets4DJT @bigbadbillybrad Yeah, I heard about that El Chapo money – wonder if it really exists or is recoverable? Wall bonds, that's an interesting idea – very dubya dubya two!
@Dannymako @Tweets4DJT @bigbadbillybrad He certainly seems bound &amp; determined to. If he ends up getting it done, it'll be a real political rabbit out of a hat. I wouldn't put it past him, though, to actually get it done, for we all know how full of surprises he is – truly, as they say, a different kind of president.
@sheelgetshyphy @nytopinion The only place I know of in the U.S. system where notable delays exist is the emergency room, but even that's relative to the urgency of the kinds of patients who show up there; and of course people with no insurance know they can go there, which accounts for much of the delays.
@mgrant76308 Between these seven and the killer himself, there should be at least one trip to death row in there somewhere. Let's hope California and its judges have the inclination and resolve to follow through on consigning at least one of these filth pigs to Hell.

@sheelgetshyphy @nytopinion Not really metrics so much as anecdotal evidence and intuition. And there's plenty of evidence Canadians and British are often aghast at and frustrated by oppressive delays in healthcare delivery and oppressive restrictions on healthcare options. Which is why they go to the U.S.
@sheelgetshyphy @nytopinion Yeah, could be. I just do believe that the U.S. system is, all things considered, the best in the world, which, I think, even people in Canada and the UK secretly realize.
@LotusB10 @PenguinUKBooks @scarcurtis @Twitter Hmm, may have been MY settings, which I just changed, so maybe try reading again and see what happens.

@sheelgetshyphy @nytopinion I'm sure marketing does play a big role, as it always does with successful businesses. As for better outcomes, samplings &amp; other statistical topics, I'd just be getting in way over my head to start talking about such arcane matters that are the purview of people who have Ph.D.'s.
@sheelgetshyphy @nytopinion I'm no expert, but I know that two big reasons foreigners from single-payer countries go to the U.S. for healthcare is to escape (1) egregious delays in healthcare delivery and (2) widespread regulatory restrictions on healthcare options, both associated with single-payer systems
@MsDayglo @MiaFarrow Yeah, I can imagine. Her mother's a poet; how could Molly fail to inherit some of that quality of spiritual beauty? Molly must be one of those people who can come off as tough as nails but nonetheless has a heart of gold – refreshing and encouraging and comforting to know.

@Zziporrah @TheMiddle123 @TeachESL Yeah, sounds correct.

@suemayart His name is Robert Francis – not Beto. He knows that in Texas, with its huge Hispanic &amp; Latino constituency, which is predominantly Democratic – he knows that, politically and electorally, being a spic is better than being a mic. There's nothing accidental at all about being Beto
@suemayart I don't dispute or refute that. All I'm doing is making the political analysis of what it is he's up to, and I don't believe anyone can say that my analysis, whether or not it's correct, is unreasonable, irrational or unwarranted. He's engaged in deliberate political posturing.
@suemayart Bill de Blasio, by the way, did pretty much the same thing in New York City when he ran for mayor; he changed his name from his real German name to his brand new Italian name, because he understood that a paesan would play better politically in the Big Apple than a kraut.
@suemayart As may be. In any event he's pandering by playing up linguistic, social, cultural and political connotations and implications of his nickname. "Hello, I'm Nacho McNair, and I'm running for governor of Texas. On Election Day, I'd sure appreciate your vote." It's political theater.

@ImmaBioloG Hey, y'know what's funny? I'm being followed on Twitter by, like, three different Palestinian dudes from Gaza – I wonder just what they make of some of the shiznit I tweet out?! Lol!
@ImmaBioloG It's academic – she's a woman who's well married. Anyway, Zuckerberg married Priscilla Chan, and, last I knew, Musk was dating some seemingly marginal and obscure pop divette – though he may've moved on by now. But my point is, their wealthy geekdom can draw all manner of wimmins
@ImmaBioloG Yep. And it's perfectly reasonable to balk at both body objectification &amp; clothing objectification. The larger issue for me, though, is, why not just show how freakin thick-skinned you are &amp; just ignore the whole business – let it be water off a duck's back. That's what I admire.
@ImmaBioloG Sure. To be Devil's advocate for the journo, his stated main purpose was to say: "Oh, come on, she talks about not having money to pay the rent but here she is waltzing into Congress in a brand new, expensive dress?" Problem for the journo is, his photo was construed differently.
@ImmaBioloG Yeah, I do in fact believe that THAT was a big part of what the kerfuffle was about. As much as his camera was in theory leering at her from behind, what really got under her skin, I think, was that the guy made an issue out of what she was wearing, which he'd never do with a man
@ImmaBioloG than
@ImmaBioloG I think "womansplaining" should be a thing. Some men use that term in a snarky way, but, honestly, what's good for the gander's good for the goose. My point about nerdiness and geekiness is, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, whoever they end up with, could both get a single Beyoncé.
@ImmaBioloG Yeah, certainly. In this case it was just maybe the timing. The video was from behind as she walked away, and she was at far enough of a distance that her rear end ended up in the video. If he'd captured her walking toward him, it woulda played out differently. Was a kerfuffle.
@ImmaBioloG Well, he took the video from behind and at a certain distance so, yeah, it included her derrière. I have no idea what the journo's mens rea was – only God and he know for sure. But, right, not only would no one want to see those asses, a journo wouldn't focus on a man's clothing.
@ImmaBioloG Are you kidding me? Nerdiness or geekiness can get you laid in this day &amp; age. That just wasn't a thing when I was a teenager. Silicon Valley &amp; the Marvel Extended Universe have been game-changers. Lol! A woman mansplainer? Perfect! That could be an SNL-skit recurring character.
No, if the guy's purpose was sexual, and she objected to that, that wouldn't at all be a meltdown, but what the guy meant to do was video her brand new and putatively expensive dress to make the point, "Wait a minute, I thought she couldn't even afford rent!" It wasn't sexual. https://t.co/7bhZiNslb9
@ImmaBioloG Oh, y'know, that was an incident where she walked into the Capitol one day in a brand spanking new dress, and some journo photogged her from behind to capture the dress on video (his point: she has no money?), but it ended up being about this guy's leering at her body. Went viral
@ImmaBioloG Lol, nice and nerdy! But, seriously, it's not like the guy's lecturing her about IPAs or single-malt Scotch whiskies. He's – much less complicatedly – calling her a liar. Now, obviously that doesn't sit well with her, and he may be unfair, but what he's NOT doing is mansplaining.
@ImmaBioloG Taken ownership, you mean? I musta bin asleep during those news cycles. All I've ever seen her do is (1) avoid debating people who challenge her to debates (accused one guy of "catcalling" her); and (2) never deal with criticism well but rather melt down over cameras on her butt.

@Ocasio2018 So, Rep.-elect Ocasio-Cortez, he may or may not be mansplaining, but that isn't the issue. The issue is, are YOU or are YOU not lying about who you are and where you came from and just exactly how you grew up? For once in your young life, can you take ownership of a truth issue?

@Ocasio2018 At the risk of mansplaining, 2 things: (1) "to mansplaining" isn't English grammar; you can say "to mansplain" (an infinitive) or "mansplaining" (a gerund); &amp; (2) the phrase "begs the question" doesn't mean "raises the question"; it's a logical term &amp; refers to circular reasoning

@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy You're the one who brought up mental illness. Don't back-peddle now.
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy I'm sure that's true. The question is, what legitimate reason do YOU have for stating that I'm mentally ill? Are you in fact a professional mental health worker? Did you just take a class in college? Did you read a book or a Cosmo article? Where are you coming from? Yes, yes?
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy So now you're doubling down on asserting that you have a legitimate reason for stating that I'm mentally ill? That's where you're taking us now?  lol  And I'm not even bothering to ask whether you're a professional mental health worker or even took a psych class in college.  lol
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy You should run for office. You should be a U.S. Representative or Senator or even president of the United States. With your mental health move down pat, you're a natural for these times. It's the slur that keeps on giving, even if you have zero actual knowledge of mental health.
@dodgytheclown Yeah, you said it. What a sad and angry-making story!
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy Thank you. See how good it feels to acknowledge a truth? You've taken your first step into a larger world. Yeah, I know, ripped off from Star Wars, but it's a true cliché.
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy Lol! Seriously? The mental health meme? That's the go-to for journalists and politicians in America when they want to attack someone without calling them a  n@#$%^   or  a f@#$%^  or  a c@#$. They avoid all that simply by calling into question a person's mental health. So brave!
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy I'm just drawing general conclusions from your online behavior and the personality and character that that implies. Completely reasonable.
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy Fine. I was talking hypotheticals.
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy A burqa/niqab IS a hijab. What nomenclature is in dispute?
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy You can't possibly have a boyfriend or husband that I can imagine. How could a relationship survive your cowardice and lack of character? Sad. I never expected to encounter a person like you on the Net.
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy Of course I'm not. I'm describing YOU. You are the kind of person who, if she were being fired, would say: No I'm not.  lol
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy You were wrong to say the burqa/niqab is NOT a hijab. How simple is that? You were wrong. And now you can't admit it. If I am bizarre or histrionic or comic, what does that compare to your complete lack of character in failing to admit you were wrong? That is a character flaw.
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy You are a coward because you lack the courage and self-respect to admit when you are wrong. You are essentially a child. I pointed out to you precisely how you were wrong, and you just don't have the balls to own it. You are a child and a coward and you are completely gutless.
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy Why don't you have the balls to admit when you are wrong? Is this how you engage your husband or boyfriend when you get in an argument and find yourself in the wrong? You just keep digging deeper and deeper and deeper instead of owning up to your error? Pathetic!
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy Oh, and how do you, then, know for a fact that a burqa/niqab is NOT a hijab? What illustrious source confirms your belief as being reality and truth? Why are you so confident you know what you're talking about? I suspect you're completely full of it.
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy I told you: a burqa/niqab is an EXAMPLE of a hijab. It is a KIND of hijab. Look it up. Stop talking out of your ass and ground yourself in reference material. You just keep doubling down instead of owning up to your mistake. You really are a deep coward.
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy You coward. You vile coward. Go to any European country. The security issue is just window dressing. It is an issue that is handled easily in America. The issue in Europe with all the laws is cultural unease and xenophobia and intolerance. Have the balls to admit you are wrong.
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy What? What untruths? A burqa/niqab IS a hijab. Look it up in your favorite reference source. This should not be heavy lifting for you. Look it up. I am correct, and you were wrong to say I stated an untruth. Just be an adult and own up to that. Have some balls.
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy YOU said I stated an untruth, which at first I believed I had. Then I realized I had NOT. For a burqa/niqab IS a hijab. So I did NOT state an untruth. And I certainly did not lie. Why are you doubling down and simply not admitting to your mistake? Have some balls, for God's sake.
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy Women wanna wear covering, and people wanna shame them or even make it a crime. That's the problem here. Stop throwing down red herrings. Intolerance &amp; xenophobia is the problem we'e confronting. Stop virtue-signaling. And have the balls to say you're sorry for calling me a liar.
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy I just told you: Burqas, niqabs ARE hijabs. And, let's be honest, very little of it has to do with security, which, to be frank, is an issue even in a country like the U.S. But, no, the overwhelming issue is people's cultural discomfort with the covering. That's why it's banned.
@ebruenig liz, what's a "chait piece"? Is that some Big Apple thing I'm out of the loop on?
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy You called me a liar. You called me a liar. What could be more simple and straightforward than my pointing that out and calling you out for it? You called me a liar. You had no right to do that. I did not lie. You committed an injustice. How is that hard for you to understand?
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy Oh, and by the way, I just looked it up: The burqa, or niqab, is absolutely, positively considered in some Islamic societies to be a legitimate interpretation of the hijab. So, double shame on you for calling ME a liar when it's YOU who've foisted upon ME bad information. Shame!
@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy No, I did not lie. You have no right to say that. I assume you're an adult, so shame on you! If I got my technicals wrong, then, fine: My point is that Muslim women choose to adopt a covering they feel that Islam requires, and they are PENALIZED for it. That is not right or just.
@TheSocialCTV For anyone who's caught off guard and stressed out by these kinds of questions and issues, just realize that for many years dedicated women have written books specifically designed to avert such crises: Emily Post, Amy Vanderbilt, Letitia Baldrige and Judith Martin, among others.

@GaagaagiZakizo @iheartmindy That's just not true. It's about all women who wear the hijab, some of whom are forced to do it and some who choose to do it. In many European countries, for example, in Denmark, for example, there are Muslim women who choose to wear it and are penalized by the law for doing so.

@GodandtheBear Lol, nice and classy. Okay. You really want me to unfollow you?
@GodandtheBear I believe you when you say you won't. But that only means that loss for you is relatively well-assured. The Republican Party isn't going anywhere. It's been around since 1860 and before and has repeatedly reorganized and transformed; these times for the party are no different.
@GodandtheBear Which proves my point precisely. Thank you. The truth is, a socialist will not be elected president – it will be a standard-issue Democrat or some kind of Republican. Socialists are playing at the margins with loud voices and impact on the Democratic Party but no hope of victory.
@TeodroseFikre What party or politician anywhere on the planet at any time in history was ever anything other than utterly mendacious? Your standard is a utopian one and consequently irrelevant. As for Owens, the racialism and condescension of the Democratic Party toward Af-Ams enrages her.
@GodandtheBear That's nonsense, unless your definition of the left includes only the democratic socialist wing of the Democratic party. Rank-and-file Democrats, and I know them personally, absolutely do not share your view of the Democratic Party. The hate comes from the margins.
@TeodroseFikre There are some racist Republicans and many, many racialist Democrats. The difference: racialism and implicit marginalization of Af-Ams are Democratic policy. That's why Owens focuses her fire on Democrats, because Democrats do the most practical damage to the status of Af-Ams.
@GodandtheBear Huh? What on Earth does that mean?
@TeodroseFikre @GodandtheBear @TheRevAl @RealCandaceO Teodrose, your thinking's misbegotten. You have no rational basis for believing that Owens doesn't care about Af-Ams.

@BruceBice Lol, right. By the way, I see that the U.S. does have a high speed strike weapon that may fly by 2020 and enter service by the mid 2020s. And I'm betting that that timeline now goes into overdrive.
@MichaelLell Okay, thanks.

@StevenBeschloss @Cajegirls You're deluded; the earliest departure date for Trump is Jan. 20th, 2021. The 17 investigations are irrelevant; they have no bearing on a his capacity to serve in office. And it's much fun to talk about the mental health of political enemies, but aren't you of a higher order?

@ImmaBioloG You know how the rules work: If I'm either wholly or partly Native American, then I can call myself Injun and call others Injuns – no harm, no foul in that case. This is just a cultural, sociological and political reality. That's how the rules work. It applies to all ethnicities.

@ImmaBioloG Lol, yeah. Don't sell Native Americans short on their capacity for violence, though. I mean, when they got riled up back in the day, they could dramatically raise the bar on lurid violence. Scalping wasn't the half of it.
@nytopinion What happened? Star Wars. Alien. Aliens. Starship Troopers. That's what happened. Space age sentimentality did not survive the vacuum of Hollywood space.

@ImmaBioloG Yeah. Though there does seem to be something exceptional, in this regard, with Americans, given the love of football, hockey, boxing, NASCAR . . .  and firearms – something that took root in the 1630s or 1620 or 1607 or 1585 . . .  maybe inherited – who knows? – from the Injuns.
@Bianca_Tempt That's a pretty good nose. Wait a minute, what am I saying? In Greeley, Colorado, you can smell bullshit in town from miles away in the countryside.
@ImmaBioloG Lol, I think Europeans are secretly and guiltily just as violent as Americans. What's not to love about American football for these people?
@Bianca_Tempt First time I ever saw or heard the word "solipsism," it was in connection with Bill Clinton – I think maybe Peggy Noonan used it in an essay to describe him. Oh, by the way, "solecism" also means, secondarily, "a nonstandard usage."

@Afuckn90s_nigga @WashTimes @RoScarborough Again, injustice in the past – undeniable, unexpungible and possibly unforgivable by some – doesn't justify injustice in 2018. That's not how justice works. And, honestly, do you have friends and family in Zimbabwe who feed you intel that things are not better? I doubt it.
@Afuckn90s_nigga @WashTimes @RoScarborough No, stealing isn't justice – I know that at least one of your parents or grandparents taught you that, and probably a teacher and a minister too. As for Zimbabwe, you're already proven wrong, for Zimbabwe is already a better place now – just listen to any people who live there.

Yes, Mugabe is gone, and Zimbabwe will be a better place.

@Afuckn90s_nigga @WashTimes @RoScarborough People are mistreated everywhere, sometimes by Jews.

Some blacks practice black supremacy – doesn't mean that blacks in general do so.
