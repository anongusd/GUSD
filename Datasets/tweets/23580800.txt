@CoughlinGroyper @BoulosAlQans @ClassicalTheis Thats the whole context, the salt of the earth was the sufferring of a people. If hate against another tribe was exclusive preference to ones own, then Jesus was the first racist.
@CoughlinGroyper @BoulosAlQans @ClassicalTheis This is a key to understanding the whole history, that God gave to the world of men the solution to thier suffering but preferred the Jews.	That was to show not universalism but the preference for ones kind. Observed every custom but the one that mattered most to the leaders.
@CoughlinGroyper @BoulosAlQans @ClassicalTheis Yes, there is a cloudy meaning behind the love for others. Today's context, recently in my lifetime means agreeing with every fool thing in thier heads.
@CoughlinGroyper @BoulosAlQans @ClassicalTheis It was completely simple before the tekkim olam hit.	The sense that racism is a moral evil is a recent invention and in a sense, disrespects Gods creation.	IOW, God made the Garden of Eden, for the unity of people, and for transgressions, he gave the hierarchy of nations.
@CoughlinGroyper @BoulosAlQans @ClassicalTheis But that hate can empty that person of any virtue. If he fails to want the ultimate good for that person. Punished severely for his transgression, sure but not to devalue his intrinsic soul.
@CoughlinGroyper @BoulosAlQans @ClassicalTheis Hate is a passion and some hate is virtuous. But not of its own accord. Say, an Irishman has hate in his heart for an Englishman. Hates them all with a purple passion, no holds barred.	Is it a sin?	To my thinking, given the historical feud, its not a sin. Not responsible for it.
@CoughlinGroyper @BoulosAlQans @ClassicalTheis Nah bra. I can't do that line. Against family. Against country. Against God.	I can't do that kind of hair splitting.
@CoughlinGroyper @BoulosAlQans @ClassicalTheis So Carthago delenda est was not a sin, while whipping a slave was. Same people, different social positions?
@CoughlinGroyper @BoulosAlQans @ClassicalTheis Not just whites though. You are thinking altruistic when its much more visceral.
@BoulosAlQans @CoughlinGroyper @ClassicalTheis I think you mean chauvinism. Nationality is no sin as it comport to natural law.  I don't see how competition between different groups for the same resources is a sin if one sides with ones own in group.

@CoughlinGroyper @DataDistribute @borzoopovic It seems to me that the question resolves around whether you have the fortitude to endure every extreme.	Social engineering has attempted to remove that fortitude under fighting the Authoritarian Personality.	You have to have love in your heart to endure all things.

Amortization of this property is neither a matter for depriving compensation because he no longer has use of it. That property provides a secondary consideration.

@rightscholar Wasn't it Cdl Marx who said there would be no social justice if it weren't for Carl Marx? Wouldn't that also be context if it was his duty to correct a fellow bishop but neglected to fulfill the obligation?	I think in generosity you should concede the point that he is making.

@AmericazLad Sure you can defend it but in one specific area and not go around throwing accusations that require answers that only God has the mind to know.	That's the Wheat and Tares debate. Only God can separate us in His good timing. Use them to advance in charity.
@AmericazLad Yes that was the fear. Like a pocket veto or something.  But don't agree that the movement he started by that, under those conditions are tantamount to having this huge rejection of the Church because someone got picky.

Becoming gradually slaves to necessity, then beyond thier capacity to restrict thier impulse to control.	Men seem to never learn from these mistakes. A class of men needed to call attention to these lines of demarcation, that warn of the need of intervention but men tire easily.
History is full of people who dreamed of better things. A lot of them inspired by leaders who built a myth of power out of thier own history, became a dead end because they did not see truth and conform themselves to it. https://t.co/hBVHlQdX1a

@KeytarCatholic Don't tempt me Father.	A priest is necessary to a Parrish. In fact so necessary that it needs two or three of them because they are in constant need of repair.	Not just on the outside but on the inside.	You know, the history of sacrifice of the mass kind of stuff.
@KeytarCatholic I hardly know you, so why do I comment? Because your office is greater than you and you in turn are holding an honorable line of succession all the way back to Cavalry, our only hope and the greatest ennobling of our race through Mary.	Do then priestly things. https://t.co/HHsTWlPl4j
@KeytarCatholic What I had in mind; nice of you to reply and I'd hoped to find a humane response, was that a priest today is open to the world in a way that it no longer does any good. Nothing you in particular are doing, but the vocation does tend to attract more than its share of narcissists. https://t.co/2Dq53H0gTU

@pontificatormax @faithfulgadolic @raoulvilla I'm waiting for someone to post a link. So far no luck.
@BeigeShiba I end up repeating talking points from people I've heard recently. I get that EMJ thing a lot actually.
@BeigeShiba So Pax Americana made a heel turn on freeing the world of its backward non democratic past, to what is good being an inside job in the power elite. Nothing exists except how it may be subverted because a new day brought the old systems enslavement to the new technoratti
@BeigeShiba So take the assumption that we just came from the Neocon maxim that the 'good' relies on conditions outside its control and will return to the good once control is reestablished.	Them we elected Obama, completely out of the blue and rewrite the rules.
@BeigeShiba Its late stage capitalism for sure. That debt can't be supported by logic or morals for much longer. Once we made toasters and calculators and now we make code and sell market caps.	Its all gaslighting and any one with a cell phone can find out what anyone else is up to.
@BeigeShiba German idealism placed a basis of economy on the labor output of the people.	So its kind of ironic that the really really bad guys you are supposed to hate are the German intellectuals.
@BeigeShiba Capitalism is state sponsored usury. Once they run the banks, they load up all the debt they can get and sell off the bloated debt for pennies through liquidated assets.  There never has been a free market because its nothing based in reality.
@BeigeShiba Sorry.	....		Is it better to be feared than to be loved?
@BeigeShiba Its the Intelligence agencies my friend. They convince people that its in their best interest to go along.	When there is a school shooting, they repress a dozen more conservatives..  To show people the Disneyland that the system is still just barely working.
@BeigeShiba They wont collapse the banks because its the sweetest deal they are ever going to get. They've literally printing their own money without any ink or paper.
@BeigeShiba No, this won't cause a fight because who are you going to fight against? An idea built of fantasy and fear?	People have been waiting for the next Civil War since 1870 and Waterloo.
@BeigeShiba Now, the part about the exposure of their lies, it comes out and how it comes out reveals who they have under their control.	So, people just automatically do what they say because of the complexity of how they operate.	Capice?
@BeigeShiba They like to approach people to advance their ideals, with a dark past. So suddenly there is an It girl and everyone is talking about her.	That person is then controlled and reads the script when they are told to.	Thats a contract.	How is that?
@SilverJuulClub But you are at a higher level in all of those categories. Particularly the loner part.
@BeigeShiba I'm saying they like to think of themselves as a secret group with a secret commission such that when they compromise an individual to contract for something, the basis of the contract is both vague and specific.
@SilverJuulClub Right, an inversion of the Sword of Damocles
@keel_mitch And I promise to pay myself one dollar for every dollar matched to Vic and.. *squints - Toni.		I'm in an awful way.
@BeigeShiba I realize you posted this OC to be a bit of a meme but if you seriously are asking; I believe its because with every hoax they spread, the exposure of it reveals in a way who they are, and for some people it serves as an indoctrination to their means and how they work.

By Labors, means that according to its functional characteristic, the action takes place not by changing its nature but by adding to its nature this new criteria that had never been applied before.. It functions the same as before but it becomes something completely different.
By Fruit, means that by the third decade, the promise of God is completely delivered and its existence makes everything new. What was old is destroyed and what is new usefully transforms it according to its nature, by Gods action on it.
By Reaction, means that the plan is in motion and begins to act in transformation on the world. This encounter confronts and creates the conditions necessary to bring about change.
By Secret, means that these intensely private moments are personal and humble reflections of the realization of Gods plan and the resolute acceptance of that plan which is hidden from ordinary view.
These Mysteries move together the same way and are tied together in the way that they tell the story of Gods love and favored way of expressing it in the personal lives of the saints.	Something which the Luminous Mysteries does not.

@IanDAgostino @Nature_and_Race You can't save whom God has not. I'm not saying you should not even try but that there is a means to detect those ready in grace to recieve it.	And man, that ain't it.	Something called invincible ignorance.
@IanDAgostino @Nature_and_Race Lets save the drama for who it matters.
@Nature_and_Race @BigBellyBard Do you really think that? You've said it twice and I don't think you are kidding.  You have something against Christ just say it friend.
@Nature_and_Race Why would God want even one of His creation to die? I don't get what you are asking here. He made the nations. He did not make them equal. We sinned and it brought war. War is not God.	More simply, God is the ground of existence. We could not survive without that.
@Runthenovel @TheHangingChads @HonorAndDaring Also why this can't happen.
@TheHangingChads @TheHirsty Never Trump is never going to let you down.
Been praying for you. God willing this will help tamp down the rumors. https://t.co/HXzq6CE6hO
@dlongenecker1 Look what could happen if we all agreed. That would be terrifying. We only seem to come together after a tragedy.	But here is the place to put thinking in motion.
She was made by the same guys that never made this guy now we are all afraid to say it who is our worst enemy. Humanities worst enemy. Say it Trump.	Say it. No one else ever will be high enough up and the credibility to say it.	Just name our enemy Trump do it! https://t.co/DquQP3jpJn
I only pick up a book once three years ago but this cool Vice article ghost written by a bugman said he was really a crypto pagan so you know I'm just gonna say it.
Imagine caring what a Thot thinks. About a Doctor of the Church:  you know what he was a Gnostic.
You mean Gnostic like with a plastic spoke? Because my buddy gets drunk and does a mean gnostic then.
@realitycalls8 How do you mean Gnostic tho? You mean he wrote the kabbala?

@Jack99633078 @volkova_sasha95 Don't include us into this. This is Intelligence doing things. It doesn't come from Rome its coming through everywhere at once.
@volkova_sasha95 @SouthSlavTrad I'm not saying anything abt Ortho here but I get the same energy talking with the Catholic Left.	Same vibe, same attitude and same effect.	I think there definitely is something going on.
@Kushoverlord You don't even need to be white to be white supremacist. Isn't that awesome?

@realitycalls8 The whole premise of Marx was human mutability. I don't think it meant what he thought it means.

@borzoombers Look its almost tradition at this point that if you are going to be hired as the resident crypto conservative, you have to be especially adept at concern trolling. Concern trolling involves pointing out your a parent lack of clarity but in an exceptionally vague way.
I'm sure it'll buff out just rub some dirt on it https://t.co/SkfoqxJX8x
