@redleaf8 @rafaelshimunov @DanFeinreich @bungarsargon Wow, not to say that I‚Äôm surprised, but the fact that you had all night to provide even an iota of Palestinian control of the land or even an existence of such a people, and were unable to do so is extremely disappointing. Thank you.
@redleaf8 @rafaelshimunov @DanFeinreich @bungarsargon Wanna keep ignoring the truth? Tell me about the Palestinian leaders pre Arafat, tell me about the history of the Palestinian people, tell me about a time when these people were a recognized nation, evidence of coinage, government, art &amp; culture. Come on...üòÇüòÇ
@redleaf8 @rafaelshimunov @DanFeinreich @bungarsargon Just name a single Palestinian leader prior to Arafat. Tell me where it‚Äôs seat of government has been. Tell me why numerous civilaztions have never spoken of the Palestinian people but the Jews are mentioned throughout history. Where is your archaeological support?
@redleaf8 @rafaelshimunov @DanFeinreich @bungarsargon Still no evidence? Lol. You really should stop responding. You are given opportunities to provide evidence in support of your narrative and you don‚Äôt. Your lies remain to exist as truth only in your mind and not in reality. But please continue lol
@redleaf8 @rafaelshimunov @DanFeinreich @bungarsargon Ah you can‚Äôt argue with me because you know you can‚Äôt provide even a single shred of evidence. If truth was on your side you‚Äôd present it but you can‚Äôt. You‚Äôre pathetic.

@redleaf8 @rafaelshimunov @DanFeinreich @bungarsargon There were no Palestinians until 67. ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äù is a British term that derives it‚Äôs name from the Roman term ‚ÄúPalestina‚Äù which was the name the Romans gave to the Jewish land it occupied/conquered.

@bungarsargon Trump has been far better for Israel than Obama. There‚Äôs no argument. From recognizing Jerusalem as the capital, moving the embassy there and standing up against anti-semites at the UN. It‚Äôs not even debatable. Obama let Iran into Syria and funded their terrorism.

@haydaa54552996 @ianbremmer The population of Gaza has grown faster than any other Arab people, once Hamas is removed there should be peace. Hamas is awful, the people aren‚Äôt ironically they are also some of the most obese in the Middle East.
@haydaa54552996 @ianbremmer Israel occupies nobody, in fact Judea and Samaria, West Bank, should be part of israel. Same with parts of Jordan if we really want to go to biblical time. But I‚Äôll tolerate that israel isn‚Äôt whole.

@NumbersMean @stmilonyc @BillKristol Yes, through 3 quarters GDP growth in the USA is 3.3%. If you multiply that times 3 you get 9.9%, which requires 2.1% Q4 growth to get 12% added totals and divided by 4 you get 3%.

@chrislhayes The strength of the economy is going to propel him to 2020 victory and continue expanding the growth of this country.
@SethAbramson The truth is Manafort has nothing on Trump and because Manafort is the likely the biggest fish they‚Äôre going to try and give him a massive punishment. Otherwise this looks like a joke of an investigation and numerous members of the media and elected government pushed conspiracy.

@RugbyTerrier @Heathcoatman @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump While I agree, it‚Äôs too bad European nations are still quite anti-Semitic, and I‚Äôd consider anti-semitism to be evil.
@RugbyTerrier @Heathcoatman @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump The Battle of Britain was a defensive action by the British against the Germans. I asked about offensives...
@RugbyTerrier @Heathcoatman @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump So educate me on the great British offensives that turned the tide of war. And then after we discuss those let‚Äôs compare them to American and Russian offensives, and the impact those had.
@Heathcoatman @RugbyTerrier @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump I have to say the same thing about you.
@RugbyTerrier @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump I never said I don‚Äôt appreciate the sacrifices of all people, I do expect us to assess each nation‚Äôs sacrifices and contributions honestly.

@RugbyTerrier @Heathcoatman @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump You realize Dunkirk was an EVACUATION not an offensive? This indicates retreat. Tell me how you win a war by retreating.
@RugbyTerrier @Heathcoatman @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump Sure, but most troops who fought in WW2 that were British were English than they were welsh, Irish, or Scottish.
@RugbyTerrier @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump The truth hurts, maybe you should be less sensitive, and be more honest that it was the USA and Russia that protected Europe and defeated the Nazis. I‚Äôm not going to coddle your emotions.
@Heathcoatman @RugbyTerrier @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump No, England was defending itself from being taken over. They weren‚Äôt mounting an offensive, they did not come to France‚Äôs aid...
@RugbyTerrier @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump Britain didn‚Äôt lead the charge, they defended their homeland. And the German blitzkreig destroyed London. It was the USA Marshall plan that rebuilt Europe.
@Minimadden No I do not think so. We‚Äôve had so many wars since the end of world war 2, even in Europe, such as in the balkans, Yugoslavia, Chechnya, as well as Korea, Vietnam, numerous wars in Africa, etc.
@lcsboyz @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump Your naivety on the subject would be better appreciated somewhere else. Your superficial analysis should not enter this conversation. You are now blocked.
@RugbyTerrier @Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump To what degree though? I agree they had a ‚Äúhand‚Äù in defeating fascism I‚Äôd hardly consider those nations to be the nation‚Äôs which led the charge, like the USA did, as well as Russia.
@Minimadden I‚Äôd hardly consider this to be short sighted because in order to look into the future you need to remember how we got here.
@Minimadden Well the USA is very well protected due to geopolitics and our military. We have no duty to defend others, even though we do. And I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs european selfishness that has led to this moment, and Trump is the first President to address these issues.
@Minimadden And of course I am referring to legal migration refugee/asylum seekers and not illegal migration such as what we‚Äôve seen from Northern Africa/sahal region into Spain, Greece, Italy, and Turkey.
@Minimadden I‚Äôve looked it up. The USA accepts over 85% of the world‚Äôs refugees that are in fact admitted to their host nation. Obviously the migration due to Syria and the Arab spring/winter changed that, but consistently what I say has been the truth since end of WW2.
@Minimadden I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs our job to protect other wealthy nations. Trump knows, as do they, that they have the ability to protect themselves, and instead they prioritize their spending in other areas. Not to mention European nations lack morals and are among the most corrupt.
@Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump Not to mention the USA is the only nation which contributes as much aid to the rest of the world and accepts more refugees per year than the rest of the world combined. Oh and we assert ourselves and come to the defense of many nations around the world, whereas EU doesn‚Äôt.
@Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump I see it more that he‚Äôs asserting American leadership and letting the world know that he understands our place in the world and our leverage. We represent 26% of the world‚Äôs GDP, less than 1/25th of the population, and have the world‚Äôs largest military, by far.

@WalshFreedom If they acted as Acosta does, absolutely. Instead the media was full of relatives of Obama admin staff, for instance CBS President was David Rhodes, who is Ben Rhodes‚Äô brother, or ‚Äújournalists‚Äù who fawned over Obama.
@Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump If you think about WW 2, France capitulated in a matter of weeks if not months, because they did invest in military. And then it was us, the USA, along with Russia that defeated the Nazis and saved Europe from the Nazis. It certainly wasn‚Äôt the Vichy government.
@Minimadden @RichardHaass @realDonaldTrump Totally agree, which European nations realize they NEED USA. That‚Äôs why it makes little sense to me that they would be so disrespectful and not contribute to their own defense. Instead we protect them. And obviously their mindset when it comes to work and taxes is at issue.

@edfischman @McFaul Honestly, my issue is with how democrats have made this a binary decision. If I don‚Äôt support the Paris Accords I‚Äôm against protecting our environment...that‚Äôs ridiculous. I just tend to think there are better ways from what is a political agreement.
@McLovinSJ @McFaul You‚Äôre not very bright and your lack of an ability to have civil and substantive conversation has led to the conclusion of our dialogue. Have a nice day.
@edfischman @McFaul It‚Äôs obvious that oil and gas are far cheaper than renewables, and yet this planet suffers to provide all of humanity with hot water and air conditioning, so before you want to be efficient and provide for all you want to move to address another issue. That doesn‚Äôt sound logical.
@edfischman @McFaul I‚Äôm not advocating ‚Äúdoing nothing,‚Äù I‚Äôm advocating pragmatism. And the Paris Accords are neither binding on each nation nor enforceable by a governing body. Have you read the accords?
@edfischman @McFaul My mind is on the here and now first and foremost. I don‚Äôt like the terrible conditions that billions live in today. They will continue to suffer as will their progeny if we lack pragmatism to address their current energy needs.
@edfischman @McFaul I‚Äôve never advocated for the destruction of humanity, I advocate for consideration of people in the developing world. Let‚Äôs be honest, most of those people already lack access to air conditioning, hot water, etc. which we in America and he developed world take for granted.
@edfischman @McFaul We can have serious discussions about protecting our environment, that  doesn‚Äôt deny the billions of people in the developing world of a chance at a better life. Renewables are the FUTURE, when the technology catches up to it.
@edfischman @McFaul I‚Äôm totally in support of rebuilding our forests. Specifically in Brazil where we have decimated the Amazon. However, there are millions of Brazilians who suffer from extreme poverty. So we can rebuild the forests and let many live in squalid conditions.
@edfischman @McFaul I disagree with your argument, given the lack of scientific tools and a written record concerning the deterioration of forests, as well as numerous other environmental indicators of which we‚Äôve only been able to record over the last 50-100 years.
@edfischman @McFaul Even 100,000 years out of a history of 4.5 billion is a blip. Your argument wants to punish the poorest people in the world, you want to make their lives more difficult to protect the wealth of the most developed nations.
@edfischman @McFaul So now your argument is that we should stop cutting down forests...something I agree with. This isn‚Äôt the same as shifting the global energy platform from oil and natural gas to sunlight, water, air and other renewable sources...
@edfischman @McFaul No you are a sheep. You‚Äôre ignorance about the money behind politics would be astounding to me if it wasn‚Äôt so expected from a Bernie supporter. It took less than 20 years for the ozone problem to be solved. It didn‚Äôt require a massive shift in environmental policy.
@edfischman @McFaul Human related deaths don‚Äôt prove causation, though they may show correlation. Famines and droughts have been prominent in recorded human history, I doubt you attribute those to human industry...
@edfischman @McFaul That is the story of living things. Just like people die so do other living things. And from death comes rebirth. Our planet was able to become fruitful again after numerous ice ages. Somethings are out of our control. Let‚Äôs not forget the fear about the ozone layer...
@edfischman @McFaul India depends on coal, China &amp; japan are sitting on massive oil fields in the South China Sea, the USA has invested in infrastructure for our new natural gas and oil finds. And again, every nation that signed the PA have had to reassess its pollution reduction promises.
@edfischman @McFaul We aren‚Äôt setting the world on fire nor destroying the entire eco system. The green energy technologies are not efficient enough, would lead to drastic increases in bills to consumers, and there simply isn‚Äôt mass appeal to provide such technologies world wide.
@NonnaSJF @McFaul I also submit that the climate changes, as it should, and nothing remains static. I also believe that the measure of destruction is being evaluated by a $ amount rather than science. We are in our infancy of understanding the planet. Remember fear over the deterioration of ozone?
@NonnaSJF @McFaul I‚Äôm for the advancement of the human race and better lives for all humans. I also submit that the earth is a far more powerful force than humans and will adjust in a way that does not destroy the human race. Furthermore, I don‚Äôt believe the situation is as dire as you do.

@Zekesgirl1959 @McFaul Well FAT ASS, look up solyndra, look up the other investments made by the obama administration into green energy products, look at the cost of these green energy projects and then compare them to fossil fuel industries. Once you open your mind you‚Äôll see.
@EmmaLevert @McFaul Care to argue substance or is this the best you could come up with?
@Bwonk_Bwonk @siouxsiespal @McFaul Well that‚Äôs because Germany doesn‚Äôt have fossil fuels sitting on German land. Sure there are pockets of coal, but there isn‚Äôt oil or natural gas, like there is in Scandinavian waters. Same goes for continental Europe.
@McLovinSJ @McFaul Really? Every single thing? Please look up what happened to Solyndra and numerous other green energy projects that the obama administration invested in. Then see who owns them and then see if they donated to his campaigns.
@NonnaSJF @McFaul You‚Äôre aware that this planet is 4.5 billion years old, has had numerous ice ages, and had organisms that precede humans by hundreds of millions of years right?
@edfischman @McFaul Are you intentionally ignoring the fact that the Paris accords are non binding and self enforcing? Or that all nations are already admitting they won‚Äôt be able to meet their promises in decreasing its own pollution levels?

@McFaul What is the definition of a ‚Äúnationalist?‚Äù You are making it sound like putting your nation first is a bad thing, and I‚Äôd even go so far as ignoring how a word‚Äôs definition evolves over time. An example being the word ‚Äúliberalism.‚Äù
@n_e_azil I think you need to be a little less naive about the nexus between POLICY and POLITICS. Have a nice day.
@Bwonk_Bwonk @siouxsiespal @McFaul Well actually Germany is roughly 37% dependent on renewables, like solar, but still receives the lion share of its energy in the form of non-renewable imports from Russia.
@siouxsiespal @McFaul The really sad part about your comment is that you‚Äôre attacking an immaterial issue in order to prove a point that is totally removed from the goal of your assertion, AND that 9 other people are as brain dead as you (or tribalistic) that they agreed with you.
@n_e_azil And let‚Äôs not ignore the fact that there‚Äôs a significant difference between a massive increase in damage (based on material manmade structures) vs. an increase in frequency and ferocity of natural weather incidents.
@n_e_azil Additionally, the USA has the ability to be the world‚Äôs largest exporter of natural gas and oil, China just found massive amounts in the South China Sea (currently fighting w/ japan over it) and India is creating more coal plants than before. Only Europe benefits.
@n_e_azil Consider this, it‚Äôs a non binding agreement, self enforcing, there‚Äôs no authority to punish nations for not reaching their goals. Furthermore, it requires developing nations to move from cheaper and dirtier energy sources to cleaner and more expensive. How can they afford that?

@CafeLatteLu @McFaul Your comment is peak naivety and tribalism.
@McFaul Also, Anerica decreasing its pollution, while well intended, does not compensate for the growing amount of pollution contribution from China (47%) and developing nations like India, which depend on non-renewables. Europe on the other hand lacks such energy resources.

@Iras_KicksArse @JSchanzer @FDD I feel sorry for you as your country continues to fall deeper and deeper into a pariah state as economic calamity ensues, and Erdogan and his enablers destroy the Turkish culture and tradition of a once proud nation. Now you‚Äôre a nation of murderers and thugs, save the Kurds!
Where are @TheDemocrats to condemn such actions? https://t.co/aJcjaMPt5i
@Iras_KicksArse @JSchanzer @FDD You mean the false flag operation by Erdogan. We all know how Erdogan staged a fake coup in order to consolidate power in HIMSELF.

@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 If that‚Äôs your opinion you‚Äôre free to hold it. But you sound like Trump. I don‚Äôt mind this posture if it‚Äôs based on facts. As a Canadian, if I were you I wouldn‚Äôt share this point of view with other fellow Canadians.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Lol, so as I‚Äôve said before, you look at the world and issues as binary choices. It‚Äôs either black or white. That‚Äôs not realistic. It‚Äôs ‚Äúfree‚Äù in the sense that there aren‚Äôt artificial controls used to prevent the private marketplace from developing on its own.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 No it‚Äôs not devestating in that it has completely destroyed an industry however, it is devestating to the individuals in those industries, especially as Canadian subsidies force American costs up.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Can you be more specific when you say violent US based crime- who exactly are you speaking of? And are you saying Canada should shutter it‚Äôs border with the USA or saying the USA needs to shutter its border with Mexico?
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 That‚Äôs not the same as a tariff or subsidies! Lol come on. Tariffs and subsidies apply to private goods sold and exported/imported. You‚Äôre confounding this issues. The USA government isn‚Äôt force to buy abroad.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 And the USA isn‚Äôt blackmailing Canada, it‚Äôs forcing Canada to lower its tariffs on American exports and to lowere subsidies in industries that are devestating to the American industry.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 India and Pakistan have the most volatile shared border in the world, they are enemies with each other, both carry nukes, and their shared history is littered with conflict. That‚Äôs not the same characterization I would apply to the USA/Canada relationship.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 There is nothing about the USA military complex that distorts any market. US military equipment is consistently more advanced than that if every other nation, and so smaller nations choose to buy from the USA.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 It‚Äôs not a subsidy, it‚Äôs an industry based on supply and demand. The US government has the world‚Äôs largest military, it purchases products and exports its services around the world in addition to conduction its own set of offensive and defensive maneuvers to protect US interests.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 If you think pro-American is anti-Canadian and anti- every other nation in the world, that means your views of international political dynamics is warped. This isn‚Äôt a 0 sum game. Have a good day.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Wow. I feel sorry for you. You must really take Canada‚Äôs place in the world‚Äôs hierarchy for granted. Yet alone the mere fact that nations like GB and France are still in the UN Security Council.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Your belief is rather binary and not pragmatic. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm a dual citizen of India and Pakistan.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 I agree with this statement. Again, that‚Äôs not the same as imposing high tariffs on goods you sell to your ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù And the western world and probably the majority of the world benefits from an American ability to keep other markets stable.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Individual states cannot impose stricter laws concerning trade than federal laws without conflicting with the commerce clause. And yes the US government restricts the purchase of products to US goods, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. And the USA has the most free market.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Who are you with these rules? Trump isn‚Äôt anti-Canadian, he‚Äôs pro American. If you don‚Äôt understand that difference than I can imagine you struggle with a lot.
@Dred_Tory @coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Morally fraudulent? Lol what?
@frankmalone110 @realDonaldTrump In order for him to be considered either corrupt or a criminal he‚Äôd first need to be found guilty of a crime, and more specifically corruption.
@LibbyDawson1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Of course he pays federal income tax. Unless he‚Äôs suffered a massive loss prior. The USA government helps people to save and restore their wealth if they‚Äôve lost big in the past. Everyone can claim this due to a bad investment or purchase.
@LibbyDawson1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 They don‚Äôt pay a lower rate of income tax, they‚Äôre able to claim more deductions and credits due to their diversified portfolios. The progressive income tax already requires people who make over $400,000 significantly higher percentage of their federal income tax.
@LibbyDawson1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 JEFF Bezos, for instance, an avowed Democrat, is the world‚Äôs wealthiest person with $120 billion+ why don‚Äôt democrats demand that he give up over 59% of his wealth to help so many of our poor?
@LibbyDawson1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 The markets are hurting because of an increase in the federal interest rate. The industry that has been hurt is the tech sector which has also seen the largest gains under Trump. Obviously the 1% will attain more wealth but the poor are getting wealthier but the gap is growing.

@willemin_mike @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 If you read my responses to other people who posted the same comment, I posted a Forbes article to support my argument.

@cowboyangels @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Oh by the way, I laugh at Fox News, CNN and MSNBC- cable news is for fools.
@cowboyangels @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Yes he had multiple single quarters that exceed Q2 2018, that‚Äôs not what I said though. I said Obama never had a full year exceed 3% growth. He‚Äôs the first president in history to serve 8 years and not have GDP exceed 3%, under Trump it‚Äôs going to happen in year 2.
@cowboyangels @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Yes, we‚Äôve heard that Democrat talking point before, unfortunately all the economic data says otherwise. And yes there was stock buy back and that‚Äôs not all. The tax cuts brought corporations from abroad back into the USA and has led to new foreign investment.
@cowboyangels @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Also because Trump governs with corporate growth in mind investors are more likely to invest due to an ease in the amending of the tax code. More investors = expansion = more jobs. And this goes beyond publicly traded companies.
@cowboyangels @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 It‚Äôs doing exceptionally better, the difference is remarkable. Under Trump GDP growth exceeds over 3.6% this year, we are expected to grow over 3.4% this year, confidence indexes are at it near all time highs. Obama didn‚Äôt exceed 3% in any single year.

@gzuckier @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 You must not listen closely to what he says. Nor did you watch him on 60 minutes tonight. That‚Äôs not his position nor the position of his supporters.
@gzuckier @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 No. But his campaign did spend only $390 million compared to HRC spending over $758 million.
@JoelCraig1 @SP2755 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 The USA has superior leverage over Canada. If Canada tries to impose their own retaliatory tariffs the USA government can account for them while the Canadian tariffs will hurt Canadian consumers.
@cowboyangels @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 And yet the economy is growing at rates we haven‚Äôt seen in over 12 years.
@Dr_Betsy94 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Why would I watch Fox News? I gave up on cable news years ago...only CNN and MSNBC zealots talk like you do.
@JanetJhuber5724 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 There is something wrong with you. You should seek mental health counseling and explain how you want people with different political beliefs to die.
@JanetJhuber5724 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Well if the majority of Canadians believe that Trump supporters should die maybe the problem is not with me...
@kmskflix @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 There isn‚Äôt a single President who has ever represented ALL Americans, except in title solely, which was my point from the start.
@JanetJhuber5724 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 You represent the ‚Äútolerant‚Äù left right?
@Maria28978476 @GeraldMassoud @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 You‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs easier for the wealthy to accumulate wealth and so no matter the polices that aids them to expand they will always receive a larger per capita share. But the people as a whole will receive more benefit that the companies as a whole.
@midlifeshift @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 These countries don‚Äôt think Trump is stupid, they think he‚Äôs too smart because he knows how to apply pressure to enhance American prosperity. The American economy is doing exceptional, the rest of the world not so much. Especially Europe, which is nearing economic stagnation.
@midlifeshift @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Yes his tariffs are TEMPORARY. They are used as a negotiating tool in order to force concessions. He does this because the USA has the world‚Äôs largest economy and is the most developed, we represent 25% of world GDP, so he can leverage our influence for equal treatment.
@coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 I agree.
@coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 My point is that whether it is a surplus is irrelevant. Obviously America can purchase more imports because we have more purchasing power AND also export more worldwide because we produce more. The issue is having equal import and export levies across all industries and nations.
Well let‚Äôs not classify people solely on their physical characteristics...üòí https://t.co/cnMf1PNlUY
@FutboILucas https://t.co/2ybhKUuAUH
@Cheryl_Quist @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Well there are numerous ways to respect someone/something.
@Cheryl_Quist @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 I think Canada has proven they respect Trump (maybe not in a positive, look up to sense) and I think this was proven as Canadian negotiators conceded to the point that America agreed to a renegotiation.
@Cheryl_Quist @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 When you say ‚Äúrespect‚Äù do you really mean ‚Äúlikes?‚Äù When I hear respect I hear acquiescence and understanding. Trump has made the American position clear to Canadians. I also hate Trudeau ;)
@margssister @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Provide evidence of that. But while you‚Äôre at it the American citizens are benefitting immensely from his administrations economic policies.
@Jobit12 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Yes he charges secret service to rent out his rooms. He should be taking those losses personally but he‚Äôs charging the American taxpayer. As for the evidence, I have had other conversations stemming from the preceding post where I have posted an article from Forbes.
@Neoavatara Sometimes he‚Äôs just a bit too honest üòÇ
@coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 This also sounds like you believe that Canada and the USA producing equal amounts of exports (products and services) which isn‚Äôt the case. USA buys more and exports more to probably every country, because we are the 3rd largest and most wealthy.
@Maria28978476 @GeraldMassoud @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 There have been various estimates from 2017 that predicted as high as $600 million, we are about to enter Q4 of 2018, it would make sense to expect similar losses the following year until we see a leveling off.
@pat_mag @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 Yes it is a welfare of sorts, the key part is that it‚Äôs temporary. Unlike the welfare given away under various social nets, and general welfare for all people which does not have a temporary purpose or fixed ending.
@coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 I think you‚Äôre ignoring that your economic philosophy doesn‚Äôt gel with our free market approach. That problem is playing out in reality, impacting the American counterparts, and it‚Äôs any American president‚Äôs job to help out Americans. Trump is figuring out an easy way to do it
@SP2755 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 Yes he did, if you want to call it a bailout or a future advance in anticipation of future adverse effects. I actually think it was $16 billion, but it pails in comparison to the auto bailout and bank bailouts that were in the trillions. Also agriculture exports were up to cover.
@coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Yes I know what a surplus is, I‚Äôm telling you that there is a fancy accounting error that calculates, or rather is added, that concerns imports/exports from 3rd countries that travel through ports that then move on to CA or vice versa in which those are considered CA/USA exports
@coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Well Trumps tariffs are targeting industries that the Canadian government subsidized dramatically, steel, timber/lumber, maple syrup (yes lol). I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre correct that Americans buy less Canadian goods than Canadians buy American, given our 10x pop size.
@coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 He did change more than just its name, I know you don‚Äôt believe that, especially given the pace of renegotiations and how Canada renegotiated after USA and Mexico struck a deal. https://t.co/fBlO7ZznM1
@coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 His talking point ‚ÄúI alone can fix it‚Äù seems more like a selling skill, even if it‚Äôs completely outlandish, detached from reality, and rather useless.
@coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 I‚Äôm not surprised by that fact. It‚Äôs actually based on an accounting concerning imports/exports that come trough ports of third countries. The USA citizenry has more capital than any other nation, we buy more of foreign nations good than they do ours. Unless they don‚Äôt export.
@bfm4440 Oh, and there‚Äôs only 1 President of the United States, he governs for all Americans, and ‚Äúgovern‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúagree.‚Äù
@bfm4440 25% of all American citizens voted, but we actually had roughly 55% of eligible voters vote. https://t.co/M6C2PDxyDW	And yes more people voted for HRC, pop vote doesn‚Äôt count, but obvs population would be higher now that ever before, your argument is a red herring.
@GeraldMassoud @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 Clearly you either didn‚Äôt read the articles I posted, OR, and mostly likely, you don‚Äôt like that they contradict your McGuire‚Äôs beliefs and since you‚Äôre driven by your hatred of Trump, facts don‚Äôt matter to you. Either way, you‚Äôve realized you‚Äôre not worth engaging with.
@marnaesch48 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 Please read other threads from this conversation before I respond. Thank you
@Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 Yes my second ‚Äúyour‚Äù was supposed to be ‚Äúyou‚Äôre,‚Äù it‚Äôs a good thing you know how to focus on substance and aren‚Äôt easily distracted...üòíhave a nice day.
@Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 Well your mind is made up, that much you‚Äôve admitted. Also tariffs in the abstract hurt, but your ignoring the realized application of these tariffs, to what degree, on what products, and for what purpose. But I digress.
@Bnkr_Chk2 @GeraldMassoud @MaryH319 Granted, but the estimates are big losses. There are no estimates out there that say his wealth or that of Trump Organization‚Äôs, or its subsidiaries, is increasing. It‚Äôs commonly believed by many on the left that his wealth is increasing, absent any evidence.
@Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 Tariffs haven‚Äôt cost many job losses. In actuality economic planning in the other side to buoy farmers and punished industries have led to short term gains due to an increase in exports. Tariffs are being used to force other nations to drop their tariffs on our exports.
@Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 His tax reform did provide more money to corporations with a lower tax rate and what‚Äôs not discussed is that those same corporations weren‚Äôt getting taxed anything prior to the cut because they were headquartered abroad, which is legal under the USA tax code.
@Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 Presidents never truly take vacations, they do escape Washington DC and the White House. Congress is in session for less than 200 days a year. And governing can happen virtually anywhere.

@quetheeskimo @McFaul @milaniabbas @LarryDiamond It‚Äôs rather arrogant of human beings to think only they can fix this climate change, when we live less than 100 years and the earth has been around for 4.5 billion. And if you want to talk about the Mueller investigation, name 1 person charged w/conspiracy against the USA.
@quetheeskimo @McFaul @milaniabbas @LarryDiamond Isn‚Äôt that exactly what you‚Äôre doing- speculating- by believing a narrative absent facts. It‚Äôs rather big headed to think that because the climate has changed .1 degrees or .5 over the last 100 years that the earth can‚Äôt correct this gradual change, but only humans can.
@Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 I hear so many Trump haters repeat this false assertion. Trump lost over $800,000,000 in net worth since his election. Ivanka closed down shopping lines. And his sons rent running the businesses as well as he did. What you‚Äôre saying is completely inaccurate.
https://t.co/1vePkaaLRx
@quetheeskimo @McFaul @milaniabbas @LarryDiamond Trump collusion with Russia?
@coccoccoc1 @Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 He‚Äôs not gaslighting. I‚Äôve actually studied many trade issues between the USA and Canada as well as the USA and other nations. Why would he be seeking revenge against Trudeau or any of these leaders? He‚Äôs never had relations with them.
@quetheeskimo @McFaul @milaniabbas @LarryDiamond Thanks for trying to control how a conversation goes...anything else you want to control?
@McFaul Values are abstract, and interpreted by each individual differently, yet alone differently between cultures. Pragmatism must be the priority.
@Timjitsu67 @McFaul @milaniabbas @LarryDiamond Yes I agree. War invaded Iraq under false pretenses, and then Iran took advantage and aggressively maneuvered their way into Iraq and Syria. That aggression is threatening the Middle East. Additionally, Iran funds the coup/Houthis in Yemen, which is attacking Saudi Arabia.
@McFaul @milaniabbas @LarryDiamond The first question has to be- why does Saudi Arabia fear Iran NOW? Iran had been sanctioned by the USA and many western nations for years, they hadn‚Äôt taken a foothold into Syria and Iraq until the Obama administration. That needs to be admitted first. And then fixed.
@Bnkr_Chk2 @MaryH319 @ddale8 I‚Äôm a Canadian and an American, why should I, a trump supporter apologize for Trump governing FOR Americans? Is that not what Trudeau is doing for Canadians by not agreeing with Trump?
@ddale8 They don‚Äôt have to like what he does, but they are respecting the fact that America has the leverage and Canada isn‚Äôt going to get what it wants. Where‚Äôs the inaccuracy there?
@MSNBC Haha our moral credibility was lost when we did nothing in Syria for years as over 500,000 civilians were ruthlessly murder and Obama did nothing! It was further eroded as Turkey arrested hundreds of journalists and Obama did nothing. SMH

@BaneOf_TheSith @JoeNBC Ok so you‚Äôre British. The Nazis lost to Russia because they pulled a Napoleon and tried to fight in the Russian winter during their invasion. And yes 2 fronts was dumb but when France conceded as easily as they did...GB defended itself more than win an offensive.

@MJB_SF @AGoodStoic @McFaul Trump has paid an income tax every year he has been required to do so. As have his corporations. Roy Moore is an alleged pedophile, he has never been found guilty in a court of law, obviously Trump wanted a Republican senator over a democrat one.

@MaxBoot Can you provide 1 example of Trumps abuse of power? I‚Äôm not talking about you disagreeing.
@JonahNRO The members of Congress, if both parties, have continuously ceded power to the Executive, when their party was in control of the White House. Instead of wanting to be held accountable the Congress looks to blame others and not accept responsibility for their own actions.

@daenachristy @jryan19892 @RedSoxN8N @MaxBoot Personally, I think this is over reaction. The Court hears roughly 300 cases a year, maybe. True power lies in the appellate courts.
@daenachristy @jryan19892 @RedSoxN8N @MaxBoot This is arguably the first time since 1934 that the Supreme Court has a true conservative tilt. FDR is famous for stacking the entire bench with left of center Justices through his 13 years. And Chief Justice Roberts voted in favor of ACA although appointed by Bush.
@benshapiro Are you now a Trump supporter after he has appointed 2 conservative justices? Will you be voting for him?
@daenachristy @jryan19892 @RedSoxN8N @MaxBoot So we should force Ginsburg off the bench then right?

@RedSoxN8N @lisajonesville4 @MaxBoot The issue is did BK commit sexual assault against Dr. Ford, and did he lie about it. None of the ‚Äúwitnesses‚Äù Ford claims to have been present have any knowledge of such a party or incident. Same story goes for Debra Ramirez. These cases would never make it to trial.
@RedSoxN8N @lisajonesville4 @MaxBoot If you really believe what you preach you should have each of your sons (&amp; husband) go to the police and ask them to investigate all interactions with women and to clear their name. Apply the same standard you do to BK to your fam. And don‚Äôt get emotional or adversarial either.
@RedSoxN8N @lisajonesville4 @MaxBoot You don‚Äôt know that your sons never attempted to rape anyone. Maybe your sons should be investigated absent any corroborative evidence, you know- just to be sure.
@SilviaAstoria @RedSoxN8N @MaxBoot No. Judges are very forgiving and are nothing like what you see on tv and in the movies. However, if this case had gone through the legal process it would have been thrown out quite early due to a lack of evidence and possibly an SOL application.
@RedSoxN8N @lisajonesville4 @MaxBoot Equating the BK confirmation to ALL accusations of sexual assault is the epitome of extreme and irrational thinking. It completely ignores treating each case as unique, each accuser as an individual, ignores facts, and ignores the presumption of innocent until proven guilty.
It‚Äôs pretty obvious that with such polar opposite responses to the FBI investigations one party is lying. That same party is attacking our institutions and saying the FBI did a poor job of investigating. The next question must be -Why are they acting in such a manner? https://t.co/qEjVfQackG
All this talk that there is no ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù on the Supreme Court is hogwash. This is officially the Robert‚Äôs court. He is the deciding vote on all issues now. And let‚Äôs not forget, he was the deciding vote that UPHELD the Affirmative Care Act aka Obamacare.

@InsideATureen @RedSoxN8N @MaxBoot Except everything I wrote was factual and truthful. Thanks for disagreeing in a more civil manner than most other Democrats. Have a nice day.
@InsideATureen @RedSoxN8N @MaxBoot You realize that Kavanaugh being confirmed is not fantasy but actually your reality? We all know that BK was the subject of a smear campaign motivated by denying him a seat on the bench. There‚Äôs no corroborative evidence to any of the accusers‚Äô stories.
@halesr2539 Do you want to talk about Robert Bork? I‚Äôd be happy to talk to you about the history of Supreme Court Justices. We can talk about Hugo Black, or the FDR scorpion court, or a whole slew of interesting nominations through American history that you have never learned about.
@RedSoxN8N @MaxBoot By the way, unless you‚Äôre appointed and need to be confirmed through the political process your job application to work at a private company will never be as rancorous and political as what we see in DC. Your analogy is irrelevant.
@RedSoxN8N @MaxBoot Mere allegations and his response to partisan smears absent any corroborative evidence does not taint the Supreme Court. In fact, it was the actions of the Democrats that have made a mockery out of nominations to the Supreme Court.
@MaxBoot ACCUSATIONS
Responding to partisan and uncorroborated allegations is not worse that the allegations themselves. Those allegations by the democrats are reprehensible. And @SenFeinstein‚Äôs comments regarding Kavanaugh running a rape ring and drugging women is beyond the pale. https://t.co/CmbDWdvHpF
