Abrams says: "Even as I am very disappointed by the president’s approach to our problems – I still don’t want him to fail. But we need him to tell the truth, and to respect his duties and the extraordinary diversity that defines America."
This was pointed. “We must hold everyone from the very highest offices to our own families accountable for racist words and deeds – and call racism what it is: wrong,” Abrams says in the Democratic response to the #StateOfTheUnion.
“In this time of division and crisis, we must come together and stand for, and with, one another,” she says.
Abrams tone changed when she talked about what she called the "bedrock guarantee of our right to vote." 		"Let’s be clear: voter suppression is real,” she said.
"Compassionate treatment at the border is not the same as open borders,” Abrams says, addressing Trump’s immigration statements.
“Our most urgent work is to realize Americans’ dreams of today and tomorrow. … Yet this White House responds timidly while first-graders practice active shooter drills."

Abrams says she helped serve meals to furloughed workers and called the shutdown a “stunt.” "Making their livelihoods a pawn for political games is a disgrace.”
"I stand here tonight because I hold fast to my father’s credo – together, we are coming for America, for a better America."
She says her parents and family "found a way to show us all who we could be."
