@PrestonMitchum Oh, that’s funny, I didn’t get that from this video, he kept asking what reparations meant, and when she finally said “money” he said no to handing out a check.	I think that there are lots of ways to do reparative justice that aren’t writing checks but no one is proposing them.

@cmclymer @Bresnan_Bear Alright, I don’t think we’re gonna agree on this, but congrats on your passport, I know that took a lot for you, I’m happy for you 😘 🌈
@cmclymer @Bresnan_Bear If, instead of bad faith reading @Bresnan_Bear’s response, you could interpret him saying ”in the Midwest or put in the visits” not as a commentary on her ability to get endorsements but to reach out to regular folks.	You’re less hostile to fascists than socialists, why?
There’s this movement amongst the Neeras Tanden and Amys Siskind of the political discourse to claim that Bernie got popular not for his political positions  but because he was the only candidate against Clinton in 2016.	 I just want to say this is some serious O’Malley erasure.
