@StuddlyA @ontarioisproud I don't think the narrative is we're all doomed in 12 years because of climate change, only that the risk probability of elevated events goes up over time which can cause among many things, economic volatility.   Respect risk.
@ontarioisproud Just so we're clear, the carbon tax according to this study will add $125 more to your ticket by 2030.    Lots of assumptions there being 11 years out.
@ontarioisproud In another potential scenario, a couple from Ottawa with two children who visit their parents in Vancouver for the holidays would have to pay upwards to $500 more by 2030 for a single vacation within Canada.		That's what's in the article, but compare that against the headline. ü§£

@TipsyCoachman @EsotericCD I thought a bit more about what you said, I don't disagree that social media is weaponized, I'm merely suggesting that if this is a secret, it's a pretty open secret at this point that every influencer is influencing.  It's a matter of degrees and motivation, isn't it?

@EsotericCD I think you all give MSM too much power and boogyman status.  Narratives are formed online through comments and social media and then expressed offline.  You're talking about TV as if it leads the conversation.   That might be the case with 60+ demo, even that is suspect in 2019.

@lyndseyfifield The point for Nike is to sell more shoes.   It's brand marketing leveraging a hot-button issue.  A lot of work and analysis went behind this ad, they made a risk/return analysis and some number was high enough to say yes, just do it.

We always want #salespeople to have more touch points with clients, but we don't let them use #socialmedia.    Firms need a more unified social media strategy that works in unison.   Especially firms that manage wealth. #WealthManagement  #growthmindset #banking #fintech

A social media strategy is easier to design when you consider the different brands involved in the sales process.   Your firm, you, the product, your assistant, your CEO, and so forth.  Find the brand mix that makes sense and start with the largest.  #socialmediaadvice
@profgalloway A lot of firms needs to build digital influence in house.
@profgalloway I've been measuring engagement rates of CEOs across the financial services industry and comparing that to that firms engagement rates.  Authentic personal brands with high engagement rates seems to impact the engagement rates of the firms they work for.
