#IWouldveVotedForTrumpBut my parents were married when I was born!
@MissyMoToo @KurtSchlichter I would've voted for Trump but my parents were married when I was born!! Sorry!!
@KurtSchlichter @RealJamesWoods Irony - A tweet that was retweeted by ACTOR, James Woods who himself is a college drop-out but is shaming a fine arts graduate. 		Yeah, James!! You have ALL THE ROOM IN THE WORLD to shame a college graduate!! Too bad your career is all washed up!! She'd be directing you!!!
@tbiadvice @cristal_deaton @yourmammashouse @BenMcInnis4 Exactly. Trumptards never are.
@82ndVet And everyone goes to jail so, just for clarification, who wins??
@RawStory @RaeMargaret61 .@AmyKremer putting her foot in her mouth again!! I'm sure that athletes foot is starting to put flavor in what she eats by now!! She's such a clueless pundit!! Almost as clueless as Jeffery Lord was on CNN!! It's so funny seeing her get destroyed every time she's on!!
@Steven_Swenson @alexandramint_ @afshineemrani @JRubinBlogger @timkaine @MarkWarner @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Netanyahu has been waiting to pitch to a President as dumb as Trump to do what he did.  The Palestinians and Israelis have had tension for decades and this exacerbated the situation! But continue to think how you want. No one expects a Trumper to think any different.
@afshineemrani @JRubinBlogger @timkaine @MarkWarner @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Are you out of whatever mush you have in your head?!!! Who do you think did this?!!! It's those "very fine people", as Trump calls them, that stormed Charlottesville!!! Get your head on straight!!!
@JRubinBlogger @timkaine @MarkWarner Trump would never do that. He doesn't have any civility. His base depends on Trump to be just like he always is. Divisive, adversarial and combative. I've never seen a President with as much venom as Trump.
@cristal_deaton @yourmammashouse @tbiadvice @BenMcInnis4 This prick, casually, is just your common ordinary Trumptard and he doesn't get it. Just block his ass.
@tbiadvice @cristal_deaton @yourmammashouse @BenMcInnis4 Well I blocked the dumbass. Thanks for telling me. Sorry Cristal.
@82ndVet Well I wouldn't expect anyone coming out of the military to have the brains to split an atom in a nuclear lab especially a Trumptard but you at least are able to read. Then again I may have given you too much credit already. Sorry about that. Won't happen again.

@KirstenPowers Kirsten you took @MichaelRCaputo and called him out. He resorted to a little whiny boy crying because he tried to defend a 1950's ideal of sexist roles that every Republican has been trying to fight to preserve ever since Ford came forward to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
@Marina_Sirtis Thanks Marina, the Democrats like myself are horrified that this is going to happen. That Kavanaugh is going to be confirmed. No one in the GOP is going to go out on a limb and vote against confirmation. Trump is going to attack and destroy their chances to get reelected.

It's interesting that Grassley is more cordial with the accused than with Dr Ford. This shows complete partisanship and a complete disregard for protocol, decorum and it points to Grassley's preference in what he's going to do at the hearing. Very troubling. https://t.co/baqNmcvGSV
@Atxvanillaco @pammiencolorado @SusanSolomon @ChuckGrassley Where are you getting this from?? Fox News?? State TV?? Sit down Junior. Let the real authorities handle this. We'll see in Maryland what's gonna happen.
@obamacrat4ever @jfsorrentino @pammiencolorado @SusanSolomon @ChuckGrassley They like to think they are, don't they? I guess if they're watching Fox News they think those "journalists" over there are so smart. Trump even listens to Fox News over his advisors and he almost put the country's safety at risk about declassifying intelligence documents.
@jerrysanderson @MicheleEGwynn @pammiencolorado @SusanSolomon @ChuckGrassley What are you afraid of? The truth? Don't you worry. With more and more Republicans being accused of sexual assault and harassment and a lot of other crimes, you're gonna see a lot of truth!!

@MillennialPriml Whether Cohen gets the maximum penalty or not it doesn't matter what he deserves, he's gonna get what he gets.
@MillennialPriml Cohen really hasn't been definitive in his intentions whether that's to preserve Trump or himself. Cohen is more interested in being complacent even if it's being reported that he's assisting the prosecution.
It can be truly said the Democrats are definitely "on the road again"!! https://t.co/Fh8FrDmAFH
@Perch313 @FoxNews @cmarinucci @seanhannity You have a right to your opinion but not your own facts.
Remember the immortal question Bud Fox asked Gordon Gekko in the movie Wall Street. "How much is enough?" This question should be put to GOP Congresspeople. How much more can they sidestep, ignore, and rationalize before they finally realize it's too much for them to take.
@MargaretHardwi5 @SpicyFiles @GWillicker8 @MillennialPriml @Brett_A_Jones @maggieNYT Keep thinking that way. You're in the minority!!
@SpicyFiles @maggieNYT Are you kidding?? @maggieNYT's been reporting to CNN who value her occasional analysis and I value her opinion!! She's been on point every time she been on!! It's your loss!!
@maggieNYT @PoliticalDoodle Dowd had better be very careful because he's drawing very close to obstruction of justice.

@Shoelover2010 @annanotherthng You don't have to like it. It's time for the Democrats to do what the Republicans have failed to do.
If the GOP wanted to keep control of anything, it's over now. With Trump betraying citizens in Puerto Rico their basic unalienable human right to live. This should be investigated as a crime against humanity. Trump didn't act to allow those American citizens their right to live.

@MrAndyNgo @Rahoot89 For the record, Antifa is a disgusting group completely reactive to the divisive rhetoric that Trump enables to the White nationalists, Nazis and extremist right. If you break the law, you go to jail. Trump should know that. Those that supported him are going to jail.

@jilevin You notice Gillum is on Shep Smith's show? Smith knows how to treat any guest with respect unlike Carlson, Pirro, Hannity, and Ingraham. Andrew Gillum needs to campaign as a big hearted American and be as pure as he can and show love and respect to everyone and he will win.
@javajan09 @grambo1776 @benshapiro @jerry44mag No just that observant to what you said dismissing hate speech. Obviously you haven't been through the same kind of oppression that blacks go through every day.
@PoodleDoodle69 @hostagal @charliekirk11 Don't go there about children when you've got over 500 children who STILL aren't with their parents because Trump separated them because of his zero tolerance policy. You gave up that argument when separating children was something Stephen Miller started. Just don't go there.

@javajan09 @grambo1776 @benshapiro @jerry44mag That's the difference between understanding what it's like being oppressed or being bullied and someone like you who don't understand what being bullied, oppressed, or hated for just being. You need to figure that out, to know what bullying and oppressing people is.
@dontlookworld @chrislhayes Way!! Trump's new low!!
Does anyone know what Trump is talking about? If @carlbernstein wasn't a stone in Nixon's shoe he wouldn't be as famous a reporter now.

@bucinudli_usa @IAmMimiB @BillboTex More questions. Did we have this hostility before or after Trump? How do you feel about those children of whom there are still over 500 still being held as potential orphans because of Trump's zero tolerance policy? Do you really feel Canada is a national security threat?
@bucinudli_usa @IAmMimiB @BillboTex Ask yourself: Why is he making it worse? Why is he saying what he's saying? What about what he's saying don't you like? Does his track record show he's capable of doing better? Does Trump make you feel better about yourself when he says what he says? These are hard questions!!
@ConservativeEd2 @burkhartlaw97 @benshapiro @jerry44mag No I'm pointing out something about you that you want to provoke in others around you. You want this to be about you since you're reaping this attention on yourself instead of the topic we were talking about and now you want to play the victim. This is a debate not a fight.
@LitzaLawrence @ConservativeEd2 @burkhartlaw97 @benshapiro @jerry44mag Pretty much. It's clear Russia is trying very hard to piss us off. And try to make this about our unacceptance than Trump's racial division. @jack, we've found someone you should take a look at.
@ConservativeEd2 @burkhartlaw97 @benshapiro @jerry44mag Denial is a dangerous thing. Ok you're a hopeless Trumper trying to deny what's there. You're what's wrong with this country. Trying to legitimize everything when it's clearly wrong. I'm betting you think Trump isn't racist even though the proof is there.
@ConservativeEd2 @burkhartlaw97 @benshapiro @jerry44mag You need to understand Black people. Blacks came from Africa. There are monkeys that live there. Racists combine the two. If you can't figure that out, then you need to go through cultural sensitivity training because you obviously need it to understand.
@ConservativeEd2 @burkhartlaw97 @benshapiro @jerry44mag Does DeSantis really have to say the word black? Do you have to say the word black to be racist? You can't be that naive.
@67namvet_MC @EstiviG @ConservativeEd2 @burkhartlaw97 @benshapiro @jerry44mag Care to expand on that remark?
@EstiviG @ConservativeEd2 @burkhartlaw97 @benshapiro @jerry44mag The media didn't make him say this but that's exactly what he did. If you can't believe he'd say something with racial undertones, join the club.
@ChristinaClift7 @GalinMcMahon @Empire_Gal @thehill @JoeConchaTV I wish racism was as easy to eradicate. Unfortunately, racism is a behavior not a physical disease like cancer even though it's exactly like that in a mental state of mind. You can't eradicate a behavior that easily unless we all agree not to use or behave in those tones again.
@Empire_Gal @ChristinaClift7 @thehill @JoeConchaTV He didn't say what your trying to spin it as. If he said "messing it up", that'd be one thing but that's not what he said and you know it. Trump has a knack for endorsing his kind of people and DeSantis is no exception. This is exactly what Trump would've said if this was 2016.
@Your_green_hat @gml3897 @thehill @TeaPainUSA That's a specious argument! You don't think that Gillum has anything more than a race card for a platform? All those that voted in the primary that allowed an historic upset, voted because he was Black? Is that the basis for your argument? You're just as racist as your comment!
@lillysmithstee1 @JohnRya95081680 @thehill Because of who DeSantis is running against!! Do you not see that?! Do you not see the contrast in the opponents?!! One is Black and the other is White!! It's that simple!! You really need to realize the implications and the circumstances here!!

Typical Trumper attacking because he doesn't have an argument for the topic the tweet was about. You wanna talk instead of attack, fine but if all you're able to do is attack then you're as whiny a baby as Trump is. Cry on, Trumper, cry on. You can't change the facts. https://t.co/6708IKb8un

@georgie_porgie @BillboTex Makes no sense. Sorry that sounds like sour grapes to me.
@BillboTex @georgie_porgie Well the only way I can tell a Trumper is they attack just like Trump, don't use resources just like Trump, they read his Twitter feed but that's stupid because he gets his info from the TV. I guess there's not a lot I respect with Trumpers. But you go ahead and prove me wrong.
@Jimmy_TheToucan @BillboTex What about Trump shows that he's going to change? He's an arrogant self-absorbed narcissist who doesn't even listen to his advisors! He looks to TV shows for intelligence! You're supporting a man who is behaving like a common citizen! He should be uncommon using his resources!
@IAmMimiB @BillboTex If you abstain from the next election, it'll be like voting for this country's annihilation. You need to vote for a cure! If you're complaining about Trump but you won't vote then you're acting like a child who didn't get what they wanted. Voting is the only defense against evil!
@epoch_awakening @VoiceofAlbion @freddyatton @M5needspower @realDonaldTrump That's a pathetic excuse to try to give conservatives a handicap for their own behavior. Trumpers attack when there's no argument against real facts. Trumpers look to a liar for facts. If you're reading Trump's Twitter feed for news, you've got no one else to blame.
@eljay63a @IronClawGaming @VoiceofAlbion @freddyatton @M5needspower @realDonaldTrump See now that's the typical answer from a Trumper. No compelling argument, no citations, no real words, just attacks. Anyone can act like Trump but it takes a real American to try to work the problem.
@VoiceofAlbion @freddyatton @M5needspower @realDonaldTrump What jobs? Oh that's right, companies are closing up and leaving the country. What peace?

@Hys2pid @Asanokyo @26LondonCalling @MylesNow @kkkkkimba @ToxicExplodley @meowomon @4YrsToday @realDonaldTrump Yeah he got his own controller and everything!! LMAO!!
@luciusringwald @Mariehcallow @JM4America @CavaTzusDenver @Asanokyo @26LondonCalling @MylesNow @kkkkkimba @ToxicExplodley @meowomon @4YrsToday @realDonaldTrump YouTube is not a respectable citation. You need to do better.
@DeepInTheHills @KenEvans81956 @Asanokyo @26LondonCalling @MylesNow @kkkkkimba @ToxicExplodley @meowomon @4YrsToday @realDonaldTrump This whole thread is meant to attack Obama's legacy with the military. Not a joke!!
@Asanokyo @26LondonCalling @MylesNow @kkkkkimba @ToxicExplodley @meowomon @4YrsToday @realDonaldTrump You need to read this before saying anything more.	https://t.co/hauBtvWjK8
@MylesNow @kkkkkimba @ToxicExplodley @meowomon @4YrsToday @realDonaldTrump How bout you read first before writing your opinion? How could we wage war with the Al Qaeda without a strong military?? Need I remind you, we killed Bin Laden under the Obama administration?? https://t.co/hauBtvWjK8
@ToxicExplodley @meowomon @4YrsToday @realDonaldTrump Tell me how safe we are after reading this! https://t.co/HIPfbztFY9
I'm shocked to see the results of this poll. This is so unreal. https://t.co/plsPwLCX5N
Well at least someone's catching on to what Trump is really doing. https://t.co/mbcsC8yCxa
@boba1959 The scary thing is Trump doesn't know the difference!
@jfradioshow Good thing you didn't bet me, John. I've found it's actually going to get much, much worse under Trump according to Forbes. If you don't like this citation, I'll get another one. https://t.co/dv84PPvKur
