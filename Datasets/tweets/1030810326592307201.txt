Why must we continue one thing often and one and expecting a different result?		·ªå b·ª•r·ª• na agbagh·ªã ·ª•z·ªç owere mgba, ·ªç d·ªãgh·ªã echi.
@RuleofLawNG If you agree that our politicians have failed, why then do you want us to vote them in again?		Or should we keep on hoping against hope, allowing these politicians to keep playing hide and sick with us, along with the Fulani and Yoruba oligarchy?		It's time for silent #Revolution
@RuleofLawNG A good suggestion. 		We have elected many people, nothing to show for it.		Do you observe that no northern politician have decisively taken action against Boko Haram because they sympathize with them.		Now how many of our politicians has supported peaceful stance of #IPOB?
Our dear brother, you must match up your words with actions.		@real_IPOB is paying the price for advocating/agitating for #Biafra.		We talk and we match it up with tangible actions.		The ball is on your court. https://t.co/0HqMyNDAPp
@RuleofLawNG Brother, I have not insulted you in any way on the cause of our interactions on #Nigeria Elections.		Why then are you not continuing in the interactions, which is an avenue to drive home your points.		Or maybe you are telling me you don't have facts and figures to convince us.
@RuleofLawNG Are you the only person in Jerusalem who doesn't know that Jesus is risen from the dead?		Many #Biafrans #IPOB family members are currently in various DSS/ARMY/POLICE dungeons and prisons just for peacefully campaigning for #Boycott2019NigeriaElection #SupportBiafraReferendum
@RuleofLawNG What they care about is to make people come out enmas in pulling units, to give them grounds and demographic picture of how to carry on with their rigging.		So why should I come out to legitimise their rigging?		Why not we make it obvious to all and sundry what these people are?
@RuleofLawNG What have we done for the past 50 or 100 years, don't we have leaders? What have they done?		Your points may be right from your perception brother.		We know fully well that they must announced results of election whether we vote or not.

@RuleofLawNG Boko Haram has succeeded in creating a quasi Shari region in the North still in your democratic #Nigeria.		And the same people you want to vote in are key players in the onslaught going on in the North.		And you are here talking of not to stop the onslaught but to vote.
@RuleofLawNG In my last thread directed to you @RuleofLawNG, I maintained that #IPOB #Biafrans have totally lost confidence in this contraption #Nigeria and her politicians. Hence we want a total a democratic political process (Referendum) for us to decide whether we want to continue or not.

@DrJoeAbah @MrStanleyNwabia @real_IPOB  welcomes any opposition. We feed of it; and it makes us grow stronger and formidable. 	And we will never be defeated by any mere mortals.

@DrJoeAbah @MrStanleyNwabia My brother @DrJoeAbah, we know of 'one man one vote' mantra, yet the influence of public office holders and influencial people like you play substantial role in making our people to believe in a country that has never been their own.
@DrJoeAbah @MrStanleyNwabia @MaziNnamdiKanu and @real_IPOB has "the message of eternal life". And as a typical Igbo men will do; disagree even when the truth is obvious. Anyway that is why Igbo/Jews are special, very good in destructive criticisms.

@shogsyboy @deewonbaba @EiENigeria @rosanwo @real_IPOB @shogsyboy, these women are our mothers, wives and sisters.

@shogsyboy @deewonbaba @EiENigeria @rosanwo @real_IPOB Of course, they were mobilise. But not your conventional Nigeria way of cash-oriented mobilization; that without being financially induced you won't stand on the truth. These women were mobilized by the Voice of their Leader Maazi Nnamdi Kanu.

@deewonbaba @EiENigeria @rosanwo @real_IPOB Why then is the Nig. Govt. not looking in the direction of peace through referendum but looking for war by indiscriminate killing, maiming and incarceration. You see, truth will always prevail. No matter how it is being suppressed or who ever is suppressing it. Time is ticking...
@deewonbaba @EiENigeria @rosanwo @real_IPOB Better be clever with truth than lies from pit of hell. @real_IPOB is not asking for Hausa-Fulani land or Yoruba land. Even in their own land-Biafraland, they are peacefully asking for a referendum which is either they loose or win.
@baaziolaa @adeyanjudeji @real_IPOB Your military attacked his parents home. Killed many unarmed youths and kidnapped him. And now your narrative is, he ran. This Nigerian jamboree has an end. Engage @real_IPOB in their points of self-determination through referendum.

@yamzy112 @DrJoeAbah @PoliceNG Going by your point, how many churches who go on street evangelism in convoy have been arrested. Because for sure they don't get the permit? Wake up man.

@deewonbaba @EiENigeria @rosanwo Naaa. You got it wrong here man. @real_IPOB is not Nigeria. We don't induce people with money. We induce you with truth. Just think about the millions of @real_IPOB  who protest all over the world. You pay them? That culture of monetary inducement is exclusive to Nigeria.
@Mazzaje147 @ConstanceJust19 @ChidiOdinkalu Just checking your profile picture. Laughable. Mandela a terrorist? You adore a man that was called a terrorist for seeking freedom from the whites in SA. And you want @real_IPOB to be killed by every means for seeking what Mandela sought. This is HYPOCRISY or IGNORANCE?
@tonihamilton922 @Shadowy_Thots @ChidiOdinkalu This is the story they want us to believe. Mandela was called a terrorist. But who is Mandela today? Biafrans are Indigenous People with right to determine their future. This is the narrative of @real_IPOB. What then is the narrative of Nigeria Government? One Nigeria? By force?
@Shadowy_Thots @ChidiOdinkalu No may be because you are jealous of our track record. The Largest Freedom Fighting Indigenous People in the Universe. Recognized as a peaceful organisation in more that 100 countries of the world. You can check the facts. This was how @Israel became a nation. #FreeIPOBWomen
@Shadowy_Thots @ChidiOdinkalu Because we are more intellectually sophisticated than Nigeria? Because you are afraid to engage us in our points? Because your Yoruba Gutter Media Journalism no longer tell Biafra story in your despicable way?
@Shadowy_Thots @ChidiOdinkalu You said terrorist? On what grounds? Killing Nigeria Citizens? Bombing Nigeria Property? No. We are terrorist because we fly Biafra flag,   because we protest peacefully, because we have a different political view point, because we don't tell you what you want to hear.
@Shadowy_Thots @ChidiOdinkalu And in ur skull u think @real_IPOB will stop? Because of ur cowardice in killing, maiming and incarceration. Never! Our parents fought and died for Biafra. By now you should have known we are not backing down.	We want to show the world how despicable and undemocratic Nigeria is.
