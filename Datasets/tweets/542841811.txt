@Storm_Rising @Martina @Redistrict @JenGranholm Clearly. I'm a 48 year old white man born and raised Southern Baptist in the deepest of the deep South. Hell, I'm tweeting this from a Waffle House wearing matching flag shirt and pants. I have unfettered access to their minds. It's a dark and stupid place.
@Storm_Rising @Martina @Redistrict @JenGranholm They aren't more extreme than they've ever been. We've seen how extreme they really are. The people they suckered for a little while are abandoning them. They're the ones that matter. The remaining Trumpists will never change. They never have. Ostracize them.
@Storm_Rising @Martina @Redistrict @JenGranholm They got really good at feeling people out before they went in on the racist shit. Since they've been emboldened by their win though, they've made the mistake of thinking their idiocy will be accepted. It has not. It has been resisted. It's driving people away from their ranks.
@Storm_Rising @Martina @Redistrict @JenGranholm They've lost the house. They'll lose the Senate in 2 years and the White House probably even sooner. I've lived my whole life surrounded by them. They've always been here. They were able to sucker some allies long enough to steal an election.		Character limits suck. 1/2
@Storm_Rising @Martina @Redistrict @JenGranholm They took a lot of positions that sounded good to angry people who'd lost their homes, but as their hidden agenda has become their public agenda in the last couple of years, a lot of those people have abandoned them. What's left is a very vocal minority losing its grip on power.
@Storm_Rising @Martina @Redistrict @JenGranholm Sorry, fell asleep.	Obama was left to clean up the bank and housing debacles, and a lot of people misplaced the blame on him. White nationalists took advantage of that. I was shouting from the rooftops about it ago to no avail when the Tea Party was on the rise. 1/2
@Storm_Rising @Martina @Redistrict @JenGranholm I think this election shows we're less divided now than we have been in several years. The GOP is more white male dominated because that's all they represent. It's more akin to isolation than division which ironically is the basis of their platform.

@aparnapkin The most disappointing is when you blow the trumpet, and you know it's going to be the most foul thing ever, and then...nothing.
@The_UnSilent_ It's perfect that they try to hide behind "it's just OK." They're so scared that they purposely chose a white power gesture they could deny is about white power because they're a bunch of pussies. The leading cause of racism is being a little bitch.

@JohnCornyn AR-15s are a lot of fun, but they aren't defensive unless you're defending from 100 yards. I don't support banning them, but not on that principle. I support limiting magazine capacity to 10 rounds, mandatory gun safety classes and gun licenses, &amp; stricter approval of mods.

@ClaytorReports @BN9 Improve alternate routes from Hollingsworth or Bartow to Florida on the South side to reduce the amount of traffic. Connect and improve the street behind the museum that is blocked off from lime for some reason. Nice quaint streets are nice, but the traffic has to go somewhere.
@ClaytorReports @BN9 Off the top of my head, speed humps and better parking options would help. A lot of people drive too fast and slalom around the parked cars on the North side. Replace at least some of the unnecessary lights on orange and lime with stop signs.
