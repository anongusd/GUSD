@jerrysaltz @SenatorLeahy and went on a rage speech, along with Lindsey Graham, that's when the entire "part two" began when people started getting home from work. #MAGA are creating fundraisers and making videos to vote red - I have never see the base this energized. We are "low energy" compared to them
@jerrysaltz @SenatorLeahy I'm telling you all I see is a fired up red base loaded with white supremacists stalking women survivors, making videos and taking screen shots. They are amped up now more than ever. Before they were just sitting around hating on #TrumpRussia but when the "white male" got accused
@jerrysaltz @SenatorLeahy And remember, Dr Ford did not WANT to testify, she did not WANT this to happen. So it's not like "her story didn't deserve to be told," it absolutely did - the right way - in closed hearings perhaps to start. But to put her in front of GOP MEN - call in a Sheriff Joe attorney ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@jerrysaltz This probably would have opened up a can of hot worms but the fact that Kavanaugh wrote these memos was disgusting in itself and was NEVER mentioned. They should have went HARD on the stolen @SenatorLeahy documents and PROVEN lying under oath. Done deal. But instead............ https://t.co/zASI2w72RP
@jerrysaltz saying that Dr. Ford should not have been heard. I believe her! I am #MeToo, but the way this was handled was unfair to her. There was NO way she would get due process under the WH control of the FBI. It was like a set up, last minute game call with no receiver on the play.
@jerrysaltz We missed a huge change at getting this right with Al Franken. But he left b/c of peer pressure instead of doing what he asked for. Having due process. It could have set a precedent for all survivors in some way. Instead, we tried to prove a court case at a nomination. I am not

Womp Womp! Twitter might be slow but they are getting there! Several accounts are now not only in time out but suspended! Take these white supremacists down.

Here's another one that is trolling resistance accounts, women, and copy/pasting tweets to make fun and get followers. She was pretty nasty to me yesterday and posted on her timeline so then my name went out through her also. #BLOCK https://t.co/c6bMbqdyr4
This is one of the replies they sent me yesterday. And I am already seeing replies on my thread but I cannot see them so I don't know who is replying to my threads or HOW they can since I blocked them! https://t.co/VYHHSMVM6E
This is a thread btw and so is the one that @paleofuture put together. It's a stark warning that they are energized and the white supremacist groups are NOT bots, they are real people (most of them) who truly believe in evil things. They are targeting Jewish and POC so #BeCareful https://t.co/xWAimVoZs5
These are some of the accounts that were harassing/trolling me and sending pure evil to inbox. SUPER BLOCKER ACTIVATED - you can see the names. I cannot RT the names b/c it will bring on a new wave of hate that I really don't need more of right now. I hope this is helpful. https://t.co/VHxSnnAYgD

THIS is what I was trying to say last night. I got no response. Granted there isn't really a reason to "like" the tweet or reply, but I was trying to say that the base is HIGHLY energized b/c the "white guy" was a victim and the white supremacists smell blood! #BeVeryCareful https://t.co/kvWwb7z05Z

@getthekey @fenrir_71 @BlueWaveCS @krassenstein @EdKrassen @DLind extremely happy that Kavanaugh has excited and energized the base. If we don't counter that between now and November, if there is an "October surprise" that comes out by the GOP - the Dem enthusiasm level will continue to DROP between now and Nov 6th.

@getthekey @fenrir_71 @BlueWaveCS The base was down, they were quietly looking for ways to counter the Russia investigation and other BS. But the 2nd half of the Kavanaugh/Ford testimony where the "white male" was being attacked and fought back PLUS Lindsey Graham has fueled them like I have never seen!
@getthekey @fenrir_71 @BlueWaveCS just sit around and tweet, post, have a few protests, TRY to get our GOP MOC's to hold town halls which most refuse anymore for "safety reasons" = that's IT? That's ALL WE CAN DO? FOR TWO YEARS? Throw in a protest every now and then to show our displeasure? TWO MORE YRS OF THIS?

So much destruction, so much death, so much disaster, so much evil, so much political bad things going on. This has been the worst year of my life. üíîIf we don't win midterms, I will not be okay. Nevertheless she #Persisted and #Resisted. https://t.co/NdsraGM7Af
I can't lose her, but her husband CAN'T lose her. They can't lose their handicap accessible home. IT SHOULD NOT BE THIS WAY. I am so emotionally distraught, feeling helpless. She is a fighter! Trying all she can, but she is also preparing to depart this world and my heart is üíî https://t.co/8cvmSWSqub
So, this is where I've been. Between Florence disaster relief - making HUNDREDS of 3 way calls, searching for help, calling charities, trying my best. Because without treatment, she has 2-3 months. Dr told her today WITH treatment 70% chance of survival. She is trying everything. https://t.co/u4ktE4r25j
James and Iris have been married for 10 years. James was a firefighter. In 2009 in the line of duty he fell down an elevator shaft 6 stories and is a paraplegic with a colostomy bag. He has made the BEST of his life and his loving wife beside him 100% of the way. Her heart ‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/Z9xoiXGD9G
Iris and her husband paid for hotels and plane tickets for people from Puerto Rico to get mainland. They have volunteered their time, money and efforts in every recent disaster. They have helped SO many people, I want to help THEM for a change! üò¢#TeamIris https://t.co/l5HG1hrraX
My BFF was diagnosed with double hit lymphoma. There IS a treatment, unfortunately she was not insured at the time of diagnosis. We are looking for help. Post with information about sweet Iris.

@Montel_Williams This family has done SO much. I have so many photos I could share of them collecting-shipping supplies they bought, this baby they saved in Puerto Rico moving to US, they train SAR teams for rescue, and they take in youth off of the streets. üôè‚ù§Ô∏èüôèI want to give back to them. https://t.co/ONRzONIWW8
@Montel_Williams The family has given SO much money and donations to help hurricane victims since Harvey. They got free flights for babies from Puerto Rico  to US.

@jonfranks @FDRLST @JRubinBlogger @GOP Hi Mr Franks, I am trying to reach out to Mr. Montel.

JUST OUT! The #VoteNoKavanaugh is in no way over! We have 2 weeks to call, email &amp; write. The KEY Senators are @lisamurkowski of #Alaska and @SenatorCollins @SenAngusKing of #Maine.  IT ‚úäONLY ‚úäTAKES ‚úäONE!	We need all hands on deck like we did before. https://t.co/tzH5Dvwo4p
@SenAngusKing, please vote "NO" on Judge Kavanaugh. There are plenty of other judges to pick from. #Kavanaugh has lied under oath -  perjury as you well know. ‚úä WE NEED YOU MAINE RESISTANCE! ‚úä#CollinsVoteNo #KingVoteNo	#VoteNoKavanaugh #MaineResists #ME 	https://t.co/ovLrPdnPo1
SERIOUSLY! This nominee has a lying problem. A BIG ONE! Kavanaugh bragged about his clerks‚Äô diversity. His legal record is another story. His arguments for ‚Äúrace-neutral‚Äù policies obscure existing disparities. #Reasons2VoteNoKavanaugh	https://t.co/U6MwVHNqa1
UPDATE: This looks to be an updated tracker on the #VoteNoKavanaugh vote coming in 2 weeks! WE HAVE TIME! ‚òéÔ∏è 202-224-3121 ‚òéÔ∏è IT ONLY TAKES ONE! 	It would require all 49 Democrats to oppose Kavanaugh and for 1 Republican to cross the line. #NoKavanaugh https://t.co/xgwsnluTg6 https://t.co/Eckfw3m9e4
Does anyone have a source for @TheDemocrats that are UNDECIDED on #VoteNoKavanaugh? The last I read @SenatorHeitkamp @SenDonnelly	@SenatorTester @Sen_JoeManchin @SenBillNelson @SenDougJones were undecided in red states. I'm not sure about @SenAngusKing (I) either. BRB! https://t.co/yIXkLq7Xls
