The glaring truth is that children suffered irreparable trauma at the hands of the Trump Admin’s inexcusable incompetence. These gross failures detailed in this report will be long remembered, but hopefully never repeated.  #FamiliesBelongTogether
The FACTS are:	• @HHSGov &amp; @DHSgov officials were not even aware of the policy until it was publicly announced.		• It took 10 days to develop a process to identify and reunite families after a federal court halted the policy. 		• Even then, it was not consistently followed.
