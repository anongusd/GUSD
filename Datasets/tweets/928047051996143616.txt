@JoyAnnReid Alex Witt mentioned that you weren’t feeling well today and you looked It. You’re working too hard,covering for everyone else at MSNBC.When are they going to give you your own show?Then someone will have to cover for you!Get to feeling better and thanks for the great job you do.
@STEPHMHAMILL “Lion’s Den” is right.But you kind of brought it on yourself.
@amjoyshow @JRubinBlogger That’s the problem.He wasn’t raised by wolves.He was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and doesn’t know what it’s like to struggle.He has no idea what manual labor is like nor what it’s like to live paycheck to paycheck.
@RickSantorum There is a song with a  line that fits you perfectly.I can’t remember who does it but it says something like,”He has a face that could start a fight.”	Every time I see you on tv with that little smirk,that’s how I feel.Trump has that,too but his is more of a grin.

@amjoyshow I noticed on your show today that you had three black women(including yourself)three other women(two of whom were Latina)and only one male.I can remember a time when that was unthinkable.Especially having a black female host.Personally, I liked it!
