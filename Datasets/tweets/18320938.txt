If reporting from few months ago is true: Trump responded in writing to #RobertMueller that he did NOT know about Wikileaks in advance and did NOT know about 2016 Trump Tower meeting in advance. Today Michael Cohen testified Trump 100% knew about Wikileaks and maybe Tower meeting

It’s true Michael Cohen is a liar and a criminal. Thats the type of people trump surrounds himself with. Just look at Michael Flynn, Roger Stone, Paul manafort, rick Gates, George papadopolous etc.  #Cohen
Hey @RepMarkMeadows can you ask the Trump employee you cited who claims Trump is not a racist if the person is under a Non Disclosure agreement and would be sued if she said anything bad about Trump. Thanks
Wow @MarkMeadows says he has never heard one racist thing from Trump- So to Meadows Trump saying that white supremacists are "fine people" is not racist? Trump calling Africa a Sh*thole country is not racist? Trump saying Mexicans are rapists is okay? #CohenHearing
Is Michael Cohen telling the truth? One way to find out - Subpoena Donald Trump before Congress to testify under oath!  What do you say GOP and Jim Jordan?! #CohenHearing
Can someone please buy Jim Jordan a jacket? Thanks #CohenHearing
I wish Michael Cohen would ask Jim Jordan about this: "Congressman Jim Jordan knew about sex abuse at OSU, former wrestlers say" https://t.co/RRRxCcbqEQ
Hmmm, Why don't any of the Republicans on the House Oversight committee care about the possible criminality of Trump?! Simple, they don't want the truth. They only want to defend Trump. #Cohen
Wow a Republican just used Trump's Fake News to call Michael Cohen a "Fake witness."  So now Cohen doesn't even exist. LOL #Cohen
I can't stop laughing watching Republicans defend the liar in chief Trump by saying Michael Cohen is a liar. #Cohen
When you watch the blind loyalty of Republicans defending a criminal like Trump you realize that Trump was correct - he could shoot someone on 5th Avenue and the GOP base would stay with him. #Cohen
GOP keep screaming that Michael Cohen is "going to prison for lying to Congress." They are correct - Cohen lied for Donald Trump. #CohenHearing
When the GOP's best defense is that Trump is a liar but Michael Cohen is a bigger liar, you have lost. #CohenHearing
Hilarious to watch Jim Jordan and the GOP defend the liar in chief Donald Trump by saying Michael Cohen is a liar. Good luck with that. #CohenHearing
Jim Jordan getting his ass handed to him. He has no idea how to control a witness #MichaelCohen
Does Jim Jordan not get that every lie Michael Cohen told was to protect Trump?! #MichaelCohen
Now the Republicans will attack Michael Cohen for lying to Congress. The Problem for the GOP is that Cohen will testify that he lied to Congress for Trump. #CohenHearing
Michael Cohen just testified "In July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump’s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone." Dem Convention began July 25 2016. So Trump knew Wikileaks was helping when on July 27, 2016 he said: https://t.co/a3qFTOMkta
No one believes that @DonaldJTrumpJr set up the meeting at Trump Tower with Russians to get dirt on Trump without Trump Sr knowing. #MichaelCohen
Nice burn by Michael Cohen Trump said about Vietnam "You think I’m stupid, I wasn’t going to Vietnam.” Cohen added, "I find it ironic, President Trump, that you are in Vietnam right now." #CohenTestimony

Nope GOP Jim Jordan. The Democrats didn’t find Michael Cohen. Actually Donald trump found  Cohen in 2007 and hired him as his executive Vice President
Gop jim Jordan blames everyone for Michael Cohen except for the person who hired trump in 2007.
GOP’s Jim Jordan just indicted trump by saying dishonesty destroys our institutions. #MichaelCohen
Today the republicans just saw on their vote to silence Michael Cohen that elections have consequences. We worked hard and won the House. This is why we worked so hard.
Republicans panicking at house committee trying to silence Michael Cohen because they love trump more than our constitution
Here comes the most stunning testimony from a person -Michael Cohen- since John dean’s testimony against richard Nixon.

Michael Cohen to testify today that Trump is a racist who said vile things about blacks. That will just make Trump more popular with his base.
Of course the GOP members on committee will defend Trump today. They fear losing a primary challenge more than they love our Constitution. #MichaelCohenDay
After reading Michael Cohen's expected testimony today I'd say Trump's trip to Vietnam should be seen as Trump fleeing the jurisdiction.
@realDonaldTrump After reading Michael Cohen's expected testimony today if I Were Trump's lawyers I'd tell him to stay in Vietnam. Or at least head to a country with no extradition treaty with the United States!

One of the biggest legal takeaways from today could be that Michael Cohen's testimony about #WikiLeaks and the Trump Tower meeting expose Trump to charges of perjury for lying to Robert Mueller in written answers to his questions about both topics.  #MichaelCohenTestimony
REMINDER: Assuming reporting is true, "Trump told special counsel Robert Mueller in writing that Roger Stone did not tell him about WikiLeaks, nor was he told about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between his son." Michael Cohen expected to testify opposite was true. #perjury

Cohen will give stunning testimony under oath today that Trump knew that Wikileaks was helping the campaign and a Trump directed him to violate campaign finance laws. Plus he will share details of Trump being a racist and conman. Trump is the GOP and the GOP is Trump.
After reading Michael Cohen's stunning testimony here's what's there: Cohen will make it clear Trump directed him to commit crimes concerning campaign finance laws.  He says Trump knew about Wikileaks. Very likely Trump knew in advance Tower meeting. But we Still need Mueller.
Michael Cohen will make it clear today that Trump had to know about 2016 Trump Tower meeting with the Russians to get dirt on Hillary in violation of US Law: "Don Jr. would never set up any meeting of any significance alone – and certainly not without checking with his father"

As Cohen will testify today about Trump and Vietnam: "He finished the conversation with the following comment. “You think I’m stupid, I wasn’t going to Vietnam.	I find it ironic, President Trump, that you are in Vietnam right now"
This says so much. It's from Cohen's prepared testimony: "The sad fact is that I never heard Mr. Trump say anything in private that led me to believe he loved our nation or wanted to make it better. In fact, he did the opposite." https://t.co/romNz778lR
After Michael Cohen testifies today the Democrats will face enormous pressure to begin impeachment hearings of Trump based on what we all hear about Trump's criminality.
@realDonaldTrump THIS!!

From Cohen's prepared testimony today: "Mr. Trump is a conman.	He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair, and to lie to his wife about it, which I did. Lying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets"
As we hear Michael Cohen testify today that Trump knew that Wikileakes was helping his campaign here's a reminder of what Trump's own CIA director said about Wikileaks: It's "a "hostile intelligence service" aided by Russia.	https://t.co/6gs0iB5UDE

Most stunning part of Michael Cohen's testimony for me is that I just learned that his middle name is "Dean."

Stacey Abrams speech blew Trump's away. Period. #SOTU
@C0C0kachoo It's still sky high, Why didn't he stop that? Simple GOP is owned by Big pharma
Great speech by Stacey Abrams!!
Stacey Abrams makes it clear that Democrats want you to vote while Republicans want to suppress the votes of those who oppose them
Trump talks about bringing down prescription drug prices- why didn't he do that when the Republicans controlled Congress for 2 years?! #SOTU

Trump's only understanding of African Americans is in connection to crime #SOTU
The luckiest member of the Trump regime is Rick Perry who is the designated survivor and doesn't have to listen to Trump's speech #SOTU
Trump just said there can't be peace if there are "investigations." Trump just declared himself above the law and the Republicans in Congress are applauding #SOTU
Mike Pence is silent dreaming of an America where single women never speak to him #SOTU
FACT CHECK: Under Trump unemployment has been reduced from 4.7% to 4.0% meaning it's only down .7%. (not even one percent reduction in 2 years) Under Obama unemployment dropped from 10% to 4.7% #SOTU
Trump just lied that unemployment is lowest levels ever. It's not. Unemployment just went up to 4%. It was lower in November at 3.7% and been climbing ever since #SOTU
Nancy Pelosi is trying not to laugh as Trump brags about how great he is #SOTU
Trump wants to heal "old wounds" like when two days ago he called Nancy Pelosi "unAmerican" and claimed she supports crime #SOTU
And now Trump will tell us through lies and fearmongering how he plans to keep America white #SOTU
It doesn't matter what Trump says tonight - it only matter how Ann Coulter responds. She's the audience of one who Trump is performing for tonight #SOTU

Hey @realDonaldTrump I fully support you taking 60% of the day as "executive time" where you just watch TV and tweet. In fact I greatly urge you to increase your Executive Time to 100% of the day. You've earned it.
Trump is the first "part time" President. But I'd greatly prefer Trump be a"no time" president. #ExecutiveTime
You have to give Trump "credit." Amazingly Trump is only working 40% of the day with 60% being "Executive Time" but he's still is able to spew more lies and racism than Presidents who worked 100% of the day.
Some people want to be President to transform America. I just want to be President so I can relax more like Trump. #ExecutiveTime
Trump may only work 40% of the time in the White House with the rest being "executive time," he still serves up 100% of the lies, racism, sexism and bigotry that his MAGA base demands.
As Axios reports around 60 percent of Trump's working hours since last year’s midterm elections have been in "executive time" which means he's watching cable news and tweeting. I want to be President -it would be far less work than I have to do now!

At this point it's a matter of integrity. Northam said yesterday he was one of the two in the photo. Then he got horrible pushback. Today he said he's not in the photo.  Even if he's not in the photo, at this point how can people trust him? #NorthamShouldResign
For the good of America both Ralph Northam and Donald Trump need to resign #NorthamShouldResign
Okay if Ralph Northam was not the person in the photo then why yesterday did he put out a statement that said: “I am deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo”?!
Ralph Northam saying now that yesterday he thought he may have been either the person in blackface or Klan outfit in the yearbook photo. Today he says it wasn't him. But does that mean he had worn a Klan outfit or blackface in 1980's so it could've been him?!

Roger Stone, a long time personal ally of Trump, was charged today with, among other things, 5 counts of lying under oath to Congress.  The only question we need an answer to is: Did Trump direct him to lie?
WATCH: CNN Airs Footage of FBI Arresting Roger Stone https://t.co/Mj6wQuhf2F via @mediaite
The Roger Stone Indictment is 100% clear that Trump campaign officials directed Stone to try and obtain emails stolen by Russia and given to Wikileaks to use for Trump campaign to hurt Hillary Clinton. There's ZERO doubt Trump was aware and agreed to this in my view.

Trump is trying to frame this as Democrats more concerned with foreigners than federal workers by making an offer on immigration policy. Instead Democrats pls say no talks until trump opens government so federal workers and contractors get paid immediately. Then talk immigration
Democrats should say NO to any deals with trump. Instead democrats need to demand trump open government immediately so that 800,000 federal workers and millions of federal contractors get paid ASAP.  Then once government is open they can negotiate immigration issues.
