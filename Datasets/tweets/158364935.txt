@davidmweissman @RashidaTlaib @rollcall and this is why I checked Facebook’s “on this day feature” daily to delete all my old hateful posts
@davidmweissman yup unfortunately due to close affinity to 🇮🇱 I got exposed 2 that 2.B”H my political awakening happened before I could vote
@reesetheone1 oops I forgot Michigan exists. Don’t forget Stevens, Slotkin and Tlaib too! Oh, Omar and Philips. Dang we did sweep the MW!
@reesetheone1 and we need to put them back on the map. Finkenauer, Axne, Casten, Underwood, Craig, Horn, and Davids are a good start.
@Patrickesque but yeah I agree. “Free for all” inc rich people is just another “flat tax rate”.
@Patrickesque some countries’ public unis charge by income tiers, with the lowest tier paying close to none.
@reesetheone1 bernie friends: “wE nEeD to aPpEaL tO WWC” dems: ok.someone like Obama can turn out both WWC and POC. 	Berners: not like that
@reesetheone1 they keep on talkin abt turning out WWC.Obama did.Even won IN and permanently flipped VA, CO, and NV. Only Obama can do this: https://t.co/AQVzZAoApw

CORRECTION: 2006, not 2008. #Elections #BlueWave2018
#Elections #BlueWave2018 trivia: 2018 was the first time in his senate career that Sen.@jontester (D-Montana) won by a majority of the votes, at 50.3%. He got 49.2% and 48.6% in 2008 and 2012, respectively.

@reesetheone1 at this point best GA, TX, FL, and NC strategy is to encourage POC turnout and destroy white momentum
@reesetheone1 same with Texas. Better chances in IA where we can retake Eastern IA with the right candidate.
@reesetheone1 reason why GA is last: it’s a very racially polarized state that has a very hard to flip white electorate.
@reesetheone1 based on post-2016 trends this is how I think each state ranks, from easiest to hardest to flip: PA,MI,WI,AZ,FL,NC,IA,TX,OH,GA
