And God placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church.
That you may know his incomparably great power for us who believe.
I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you.
The Holy Spirit is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God‚Äôs possession.
And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation.
In him we were also chosen, having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in line with his will.
He predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will.

Since when? https://t.co/LDYFo3vwVZ
For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. Rom.8.2.ESV
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, ...... Gal.5.22.ESV
But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Gal.5.18.ESV
But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.	Gal.5.16.ESV
For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh. Gal.5.13.ESV
You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace. Gal.5.4.ESV
Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise. Gal.4.28.ESV
And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, ‚ÄúAbba! Father!‚Äù	Gal.4.6.ESV
And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham‚Äôs offspring, heirs according to promise. Gal.3.29.ESV
For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. Gal.3.27.ESV
Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. Gal.3.13.ESV
I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for nothing. Gal.2.21.ESV
Arise, walk through the length and the breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.‚Äù	Gen.13.17.ESV
I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. Gen.12.2.ESV
In the greatness of your majesty you overthrow your adversaries. Exo.15.7.ESV
Your right hand, O Lord , glorious in power, your right hand, O Lord , shatters the enemy. Exo.15.6.ESV
The Lord is a man of war; the Lord is his name. Exo.15.3.ESV
The Lord is my strength and my song, and he has become my salvation. Exo.15.2.ESV
So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of His households.	Eph.2.19.ESV
For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility.	Eph.2.14.ESV
For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should work in them. Eph.2.10.ESV
In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to His will	Eph.1.11.ESV
He chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before before Him	Eph.1.4.ESV
He predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will.	Eph.1.5.ESV
Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience.	https://t.co/Dr793SMzsm
So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God,	https://t.co/ndkF6Y9IQG
