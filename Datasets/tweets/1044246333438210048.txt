@Slate Degenerates
@CNNPolitics @liamstack Who cares?  Someone shared a meme.  Move on.
Twitter is a steaming pile of shit and so is everyone on it.
@Slate Due process.  There was a trail.  He was not convicted.  Take your fascist bs elsewhere.
@yoflipper @guardian what a moronic statement
@guardian Oh STFU no it isn't.
@RealSaavedra @secupp Who honestly cares what this woman has to say?  If you're a democrat, you already know what shes going to say and youre going to agree.  If you're not, then you likely realize her job is to be the anti-Trump "republican" and you'll disagree.  Why bother?
@secupp Oh fuck off its a meme
@ananavarro Nobody cares
@EvanMcMullin Lol @ this guy talking about self-importance.
@PostToast21 @CillizzaCNN Shhhh
@masiello_m @CillizzaCNN You're gonna be hoping for another 5 years

@JRubinBlogger @NatashaBertrand @gtconway3d you're a bad person
@CNNTonight @donlemon somebodys doing the raping, don
@CNN I like how when a conservative is accused of something, the show gets cancelled and they get fired immediately.  But with this guy we're just gonna give him the benefit of the doubt.  Pathetic.
@RepSpeier @HouseDemocrats I hate to break it to you, but you can't change your gender.
@KansasDems @KansasGOP This tweet is really stupid.
The #MomoChallenge this is more proof that you're all really fucking stupid and you deserve nothing.
@CarmBozzo @mattgallowaycbc @chrisgloverCBC No because it's fake.  Wouldnt be surprised if CBC hired that guy.  Why else wouldnt they have stopped it immediately and why are they making such a big deal out of it?
@balkissoon @mattgallowaycbc @chrisgloverCBC What the hell does this even mean?
@mattgallowaycbc @chrisgloverCBC I like how you're all feigning outrage. Almost as if you were instructed to by your editors. I wouldnt be surprised if this guy was an actor.  Why else would you be so public about this.
@jeffrey_vallis @chrisgloverCBC @CBCToronto Sorry but i have zero sympathy since you constantly lie to the public.
@globalnews Because they constantly lie to us?  Why is this hard?
@CBCToronto Said the degenerates that encourage this kind of stuff #FakeNews
@oliverdarcy Pretty sure that was regarding a real issue, but you wont mention that the hearing was about censorship because you're a hack.
@Slate Haha she has no idea how house offices are funded.
@RepJayapal I dont think you understand what a right is.
Every time I see this assholes tweets I think "oh no, Jon Lovitz got political?  Oh, good, it's just some unknown propagandist." https://t.co/g4naSIF0ZI

@wahwahsmith @glkitty Did you have a stroke?
@JackPosobiec Please dont further politicize marvel. Just everyone shut up.
@RepJayapal He did his job?  What are you outraged about, exactly?  That he did exactly what the Obama admin did?  Stop lying.
@glkitty That doesn't make any sense.  I'm literally telling you I disagree with them.
@glkitty didn't realize I represented all conservatives.		You're attributing a position to me that I do not hold.  That is called a strawman argument and its really fucking lazy.
@splcenter no they aren't stop lying.
@RepAnnieKuster where?  where does it exist, specifically?  when did this happen?
What a mess:		1) Who isn't allowed to vote right now?  What a stupid fake controversy.	2) Have none of these morons been on camera before?  They look so bad. https://t.co/XxzwcRyZ6F

@JRubinBlogger @RosieGray Are you salty you didnt get it?  Just be honest.
@JRubinBlogger @tedlieu Jennifer wants every dollar dedicated to sending other peoples children to shoot other peoples children.
@allahpundit No you're right, they shouldnt defend the head of the party. 		Are you dumb?
Great example of how the #msm is wildly out of touch.  Literally nobody outside of media and politics thinks this way.  When you're this deranged, it's impossible to be objective or think critically. #FakeNews https://t.co/OwpYQv6Qqd

@CNNPolitics &gt;trump says something that's clearly an exaggeration or joke to anyone not brain dead	&gt;#FakeNews "fact checks" him and acts smug about it	&gt;average person loses even more faith in the media		Yep this checks out
Just realized there is no point in being healthy, because I'll never get to do the things I wanted to do like get married or have a family.  Leftists have destroyed our futures. Soon they'll find out what its like to have opponents with nothing to lose. See you on the way down.

@jaketapper Dont be so hard on yourself jake
Now that we know @realDonaldTrump didnt collude with Russia, why not open an investigation into the #MSM? Do they get foreign money? Do they coordinate messages?  Do they have an agenda? Do their lies swing elections?  Turnabout is fair play. @CNN @FoxNews #FakeNews

@Slate You are racists.
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt CNBC failed this question miserably.
they absolutely knew @therealroseanne would say something controversial (she ran for the green party, pro-trump).  Start a new show in the same universe, the liberal characters took a back seat tastefully, but they were there.  When you axe Rosanne, they become main characters
I just watched the first episode of @TheConnersABC and noticed a couple things: 1) the writers wouldn't know blue collar if it slapped them in the face, and 2) this was the plan all along. @therealroseanne
One day people will have had enough of #FakeNews fabricating stories, obfuscating the truth, and outright lying to us.  Our democracy doesn't function without an educated electorate, which requires an ethical news media. When they levy breaks they will reap what they've sown.

@ABCNetwork Worst MCU movie
@NYDailyNews No.  Racial violence is very rare, and when it "happens" it's often fake.  The media then cherry picks these incidents to build their desired narrative and make them seem more frequent.  Stop lying to the people, and you wont be their enemy. #FakeNews
@Everytown @MomsDemand You left out "fake/staged"
@hannahdreier @BenWeiserNYT Why do you think that number dropped?  It's because he had to stop the policy because the media lied about it.

@SharonC97936831 @Alyssa_Milano Doesnt matter.  There is a process regardless.  For proper vetting and processing, all subjects are isolated.

@lapreilly @Alyssa_Milano @ABFalecbaldwin No it isnt
@CecilieJobsen @nightwing1310 @Alyssa_Milano I dont understand what is so awful about getting separated from your child for a little while for vetting and processing when you supposedly just traveled 1000+ miles because you feared for your life.
@pecosbill84 @Alyssa_Milano That's some hardcore gate keeping dude?  Nobody that hasnt lost a child is allowed to have an opinion?  Fuck right off with that.

@dullbulb_et_al @Momma_T_1219 @Alyssa_Milano That's a pretty racist assumption.  How do you know she's privileged?
@divasantamonica @Alyssa_Milano That's not how this works
@JPTHANOSSNAP @Alyssa_Milano What about when they think its pathetic and childish?
@Alyssa_Milano Wow, this is a complete work of fiction. How do you fit this many lies into an article?		Also, anyone that reads @Cosmopolitan is trash.
@Alyssa_Milano No, we are not.
@JohnJHarwood Except he did exceed 3% growth. 		But you know that.  You're just lying.
@oliverdarcy It's amazing that morons still this CNN is news
@NBCNews Wait.  What school was closed during that shutdown @SenatorBennet - please cite the school that was closed and while you're at it the "people that died."  You don't get to just make shit up.
This is maddening.  The fact that this cocksucker ever pretends to be an objective reporter should be enough to make you vomit. https://t.co/uOFluh2PQG

@williamlegate @bennyjohnson What a stupid response.
@Harvard1988 @JohnJHarwood Oh boy you got em.  So clever
@JohnJHarwood ...in a poll of CNN viewers
@phyllisj1003 @Alyssa_Milano That's not a meme
@abbydphillip That's some top-notch reporting there.  Purposely making typos to reverse the story?  CNN is something special. #FakeNews
@kylegriffin1 Doesnt matter when you never hit your deductible
@CapehartJ Keep digging that hole, scumbag.
@aseitzwald Do we really want our first gay president to be President Buttplug?  That name is made up.
@chrislhayes No they didnt you scumbag
@FeministaJones Mental illness
@matthewamiller Oh you're so clever hurr durr
@stillgray While is Pete Buttglug?
@roflinds That's not harassment
@DearAuntCrabby Fake news
@CNBC Who gives a shit?
@HuffPost Go be fat somewhere else
@NBCNews @TODAYshow Nobody cares
@brianstelter @ReliableSources @TheEconomist @HBO Anything in there about how you're a lying scumbag?
@s_waldenberg 1) spending bills are always long because they need to be.  if the media didn't suck at its job, they'd explain that.		2) why did it take 45 minutes?  are you stupid?
@RepLloydDoggett @OutFrontCNN because you're just being a partisan hack and you know it.
@iamcardib Nobody cares what you think, because you're illiterate.
@nypost oooh, now do inner city chicago next.
what. the. actual. fuck.		@TODAYshow seriously what the fuck is wrong with you psychopaths? https://t.co/DMTJMUoSXd
@kylebuchanan @nytimesarts oh yeah shes totally stable...
@farhip @abbyohlheiser this is pathetic.  like it isn't somehow the "journalists" fault for "reporting" a story that was 100% false.
@Alyssa_Milano what rights do they not have?
@kathygriffin you should get more facelifts.  really seems to be working out for you...
@TalKopan Hard hitting journalism right here...
I'm not requesting a code
@CarcinLoring @NBCOUT That's not at all what said in either instance.		What's it like to have views so poorly thought out that you have to misrepresent others arguments?
@CarcinLoring @NBCOUT Why in the hell would I be afraid of trans people?  I dont give a shit about your gentials.
Twitter is a shit hole, and its because everyone on it is a piece of shit.
@JuliusGoat nobody is "scared" of any of those groups.  what a pathetic strawman.
@AuntyPithy haha no you fucking aren't
@NBCOUT is their life somehow worth more?  why report on this and not other deaths?
@MailOnline lol yeah somehow i don't think this is more credible than our own intelligence.
@Independent hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
@AuntyPithy 1) you purposely misrepresented my argument, its called a strawman	2) you're obviously a liberal	3) I said your willingness to be dishonest to further your agenda is sick, not the agenda itself.  However, both would be true.
@AuntyPithy @CocytusTourGuid @benjancewicz No I'm saying this guy is treating the exception as the rule.  Having one rapist at a school doesn't make that a bad school.  Unfortunately evil exists everywhere.  Sadly, people like you would rather make disingenuous arguments to further your agenda, which is sick.
@benjancewicz I'm saying the tweet I was responding to was treating the exception as the rule.		But I'm sure you actually do understand what I was saying.  Its easier to feign ignorance, isn't it?
@stillgray i don't think he has the first idea of what fascism actually is...
@CocytusTourGuid @benjancewicz yeah because bad people exist nowhere else...		fuck off
@benjancewicz @deray This is 100% fake.
@marycjordan @PhilipRucker @jdawsey1 no it isn't.  you suck at your job.
@JessicaChasmar @WashTimes I always like it when people that aren't christian tell Christians what Christianity is.
If you don't realize the #FakeNews media is evil after this weekend, you're an abject moron or willfully ignorant and complicit.  Its time to tar and feather these vile pieces of trash.  #CovingtonBoys
@Quotron_ @realDailyWire Its amazing how child-like people in the media are.  This is like a petulant child scolding others for something they did themselves to distract from the fact.
@fakedansavage @WayneBesen @PeterLaBarbera @janetboynes You're not funny
@thehill Let's not put words in a dead man's mouth, please.
@nytimesworld Lol fracking doesnt cause earthquakes how stupid are these people
@MattMackowiak I dont watch sports but this is the dumbest shit I've seen. 		If they want the ball, they should take it.  That's how the game works.
@Alyssa_Milano Haha are you this stupid?
@SenatorMenendez @DonaldNorcross @PresWowkanech Good thing they cant furlough those underage hookers, right Bob?
@kylegriffin1 That's not possible, and if you had been there you would know that.  Lazy.
@RepJayapal MLK would be disgusted with your racism.
@brianstelter @jaketapper @KamalaHarris That's not a town hall.  It's a circle jerk.
@JohnJHarwood Sorry doesnt cut it dude
@JRubinBlogger @thehill You were praising him when he wanted war last administration.   I've come to the conclusion that you're an evil person.
@secupp Then stop being lazy at your job.  All you had to do was a Google search, but I guess we all know you dont have your job because of your intelligence...
@brianstelter Ooh I've got this:		#FakeNews CNN completely fabricating a false narrative about it.  Because thats what you did.  You lied.
@hunni_lloyd @WheelerWalkerJr #3edgy5me		Do you laugh every time you look at your poop in the toilet, you child?
@AnOpenSecret quick - where does @davidhogg111 stand on this?
@HuffPost nobody cares.
@NBCNews "slammed" in the title means its not news
@StormyDaniels https://t.co/vQJXZSw3f9
@Slate slate only employs morons
@IlhanMN That doesn't mean anything, moron.
@Lesdoggg @SarahBillsMafia @melissamccarthy @paulfeig @SonyPictures Nobody actually gives a fuck you're saying anything.  The movie was garbage, and you're here whining like a petulant child.  It's pretty pathetic, really. #Ghostbusters #Ghostbusters3 #GoAwayNobodyLikesYou
@heroichollywood Call me crazy, but I actually prefer movies that don't have a main cast thats over 50% obese.  oh, and ones that are funny and entertaining.
@darkhorizons sucks to suck
@TheAVClub nobody cares.
@Quotron_ OMG that's the smirk trump does.  It makes so much sense now. This it related to TDS.
@Slate No we arent.  We know sexism and hatred when we see it, and that's all it was.
@BillPascrell @HouseDemocrats Republicans did first
@thehill @gtconway3d nobody cares.  Go run around the block a few times.
@thehill How about you stop giving that fat slob air time?  Nobody cares what he thinks.
@Quotron_ My question is, how were so many people beat up in school?  These people clearly are deranged and insecure from some kind of childhood trauma.
@Slate Nobody cares
@kylegriffin1 Shut up
We need to start punishing "jounalists" that blatantly lie. It's gotten out of hand. #FakeNews
@Slate Go be fat somewhere else.  Nobody cares.
@LouiseMensch @MZHemingway @Cernovich Are you illiterate?
@RepJayapal @senatemajldr The fuck is wrong with your face
@oliverdarcy Yeah you fucking do
@ananavarro Yet you're cool with throwing racist quips at trump.  Hypocrite.
What a lovely person https://t.co/DIMEnHrSYj

@lbarronlopez Are you claiming that hes wrong?
C-cup is an abject moron https://t.co/5ONYyKKYOj
@HipsterCoffeeCo @4everNeverTrump @secupp @IlhanMN @LindseyGrahamSC @CNN What are you talking about?  Shell probably get a raise
@JRubinBlogger You're a bad writer
@TIME I feel like you guys just have a roulette wheel with different things to be upset about.
@TheEconomist who gives a rat's ass?  seriously?
@yashar @iamcardib stop sharing this illiterate trash
@whstancil &gt;right-winger?		Who are you talking about it?  Because I thought it was C-Cupp that said it, but she's obviously not a republican.
NO - talking with someone while walking over to votes is NOT a meeting.  Stop lying.
@NBCNews Stop it.  @SteveKingIA has been the same for a long time and this isn't a surprise to anyone.  You're just getting clicks from your virtue-signaling viewers.
@OutFrontCNN Do you guys really not realize how sad these fluff-pieces are?  What makes it worse is the old woman reading her script like its actually news.
@OutFrontCNN But #FakeNewsCNN knows what to do - they didn't hesitate for one moment to exploit this illiterate trash.
@RBReich where you gettin those numbers there, chuck?
@NBCNews so the same handful of moderate republicans in true swing districts are doing what they always do?		This isn't news.  Its propaganda.
@oneunderscore__ @NBCInvestigates @BrandyZadrozny Stop giving Chuck Johnson any air.  You know he's a piece of garbage.  Everyone in politics and media knows it.  Why even mention his name? #FakeNews
@JordanUhl I like how @iamcardib admits that most of her fan base is unemployed.
@GaryPriestley11 @MicahGrimes @ChrisCuomo @TuckerCarlson Bingo.  They're literally the same person.		This is the thing with the #msm - both "sides" have the exact same business model: to get their viewers upset or scared to get them to tune in.
@MicahGrimes @ChrisCuomo Those are literally the same faces he makes every night.
One of the biggest problems with twitter is you're all stupid pieces of shit.
@Slate I love it when you write articles like this and show how wildly you are out of touch with the internet.
@OutFrontCNN @RepHaleyStevens Why are you always hunched over?
@CNNSitRoom Its funny how you guys give a shit about terrorism suddenly
@CNNSitRoom @wolfblitzer You guys, Wolf apparently attended 6th grade civics.  Good job, @wolfblitzer - that makes you the smartest person at CNN.
@RepValDemings @SpeakerPelosi haha no it doesn't stfu
@davidmweissman @benshapiro Have you met TSA agents?
@adamcbest @benshapiro Hahahaha TSA?  WORKING CLASS?  Hahaha gtfo
@ananavarro Oh but it's cool when you do it?  You're the biggest hypocrite on the planet. #FakeNews
@BySteveReilly @secupp @SecNielsen @DHSOIG You cant incarcerate them together, you cant question them together, and you wouldnt suggest we do either in situations with naturalized subjects / citizens.  		This issue is so fake, its pathetic.
@secupp Omg can you stop with the virtue signaling?  Everyone in politics knows hes gay, and nobody cares.
@HoarseWisperer @secupp There have not been reports, let alone proof, that Graham took foreign money.  Stop just making stuff up.
@burgessev are you sure you don't want to pretend to think it was serious, then feign outrage to get clicks?
@RepJayapal @SteveKingIA Why do you always look like you're about to cry?
@Suemrsfish @fluffybelden @kathygriffin Just to be clear: are you wishing death upon him?
@KevinMQuinn @kathygriffin Hes the president. There are logistics involved with him walking down the street.
@kathygriffin Why...why wouldnt you believe this?
@nanajoni55 @StabinskiMike @BrentHBaker @brianstelter How in the hell does the number of lawyers he has have anything to do with his innocence?
@RepDebDingell Sarah sounds like an idiot
So "cuck" apparently automatically triggers a suspension now...
@bennyboom89 @courtneypappas @Gillette eat shit, cuck
@thisismash @CIAspygirl @WhitfordBradley @realDonaldTrump you're one of those people that tries to sound smarter than you really are and you should stop.  its kind of pathetic.
@kathygriffin @SenatorCollins You're broken
@KimberlyEAtkins Nationalism isnt the https://t.co/oRaSrovZU1 white nationalism. You either know this, and are lying, or you dont know this and you're just dlstupid.  Either one is disqualifying.
@SenatorMenendez Something something underage hookers, something something you're a slimeball
@thisismash @CIAspygirl @WhitfordBradley @realDonaldTrump If you have to google someone, are they really famous? 🤔
@CIAspygirl @JimmyG303 @WhitfordBradley @realDonaldTrump See, you're really just not funny.
@JimmyG303 @CIAspygirl @WhitfordBradley @realDonaldTrump Yeah, it kinda does, buddy.
@_Levantine Wow, this is incredibly sexist, and reported.
@C0unsel0rX I see somebody found a thesaurus and just randomly flipped to pages...
I wonder if @Gillette realizes almost all of their customers are men and they just pissed off all of them with enough testosterone left to actually grow a beard #TheBestMenCanBe #StopManHating #ItsOkayToBeMale
@courtneypappas @Gillette No it fucking isnt
@Gillette You can go fuck yourself with this feminist horseshit
@ananavarro Right.  And it's happening because people like you are smearing him.
@CIAspygirl @BedBathBeyond You're just not funny. Find another line of work.
@JimmyG303 @CIAspygirl @WhitfordBradley @realDonaldTrump That was my point.  Nobody knows or cares who she is.
@marie_donigan @JohnJHarwood I'm pretty sure they'll enjoy going to the white house even if the dont get prime rib. Stfu with your faux outrage.  Nobody cares.
@nonconfromist @JohnJHarwood Andy Warhol was a loon, no wonder you idolize him.
@JohnJHarwood Who tf cares?  This isnt news.
@DeathCar72 @WhitfordBradley @realDonaldTrump When you say stuff like this, normal people recognize that you arent stable.  Seek therapy.
@CIAspygirl @WhitfordBradley @realDonaldTrump Who tf are you?  They just give those checkmarks out to any commie these days, huh?
@WhitfordBradley @realDonaldTrump Who the fuck are you?
@rezaaslan How is that racist?
@TerryLMarvin1 @HuffPost lol there was literally a documentary about him losing his mind
@AJSav6 @UnfilteredSE @secupp Why are you so angry?
@TalKopan So you guys don't even try to report the news anymore, huh?  Its just endless fluff pieces about your idols.  Disgusting.
@JohnKasich go away
@HuffPost This is not news.  Jim Carrey hasn't been sane in a decade.
@AJSav6 @UnfilteredSE @secupp No, but they usually don't obsess about him like this or work for garbage propagandist stations like #FakeNewsCNN
I love it when the scumbags in the media point out how shitty the media is like they arent part of the problem. #FakeNews https://t.co/PEZp5Zg1VT
@JRubinBlogger Jennifer Rubin raped me #BelieveSurvivors
@TopRopeTravis @AOC Everyone in the #MSM on both sides is either an idiot, a liar, or usually both.  They're supremely bad at their jobs.
@kathygriffin @TeresaYaw how much did you pay her to act excited?
@kylegriffin1 it would be if it wasn't completely made up by liars like you.
@dcbigjohn Buzzfeed.  It's fiction, has more pictures than words, and is needlessly melodramatic.
@UnfilteredSE @secupp &gt;give trump some pointers		hahaha like he gives a shit what you think
@UnfilteredSE @secupp I like how you still pretend to be a republican lol
@ashtonpittman This is not news.  This is completely normal.
@ananavarro And I'm thankful that I can point out that you sound like an obese child throwing a tantrum when you say that.
@drjohn493 @ananavarro Never thank a TSA agent for anything.  The TSA is security theater, and basically a jobs program for people so worthless they couldn't get a job at walmart.
@2Shevlin @ananavarro You realize what you're advocating is a coup d'etat? right?  Please tell me this is a parody account.
@brianstelter You have zero room to talk, lie monger
@CapehartJ What stupid speculation. Log off, loser.
@SRuhle @realDonaldTrump This is an outright lie.  They've already voted.  Look at the roll call vote		How do you sleep at night?  This is either a blatant lie or you're really bad at your job.  Probably both.
@RepJayapal Climbing over the fence is not
@KimberlyEAtkins @bostonherald Stfu
@KKRierdan @Triplehfarm @ananavarro This is incredibly sexist
@SRuhle No it isnt.  Calm tf down.
@brianstelter @briansflood @CNNPR You didnt "have time for the segment" because you were too busy frothing at the mouth and ranting about russia like a crazy person.
@secupp Yeah except even our own intelligence community now admits that there was no evidence of any of that.		Go away already.  You're just better looking @JRubinBlogger - morally bankrupt, intellectually anemic, &amp; not a care in the world about sending peoples children to die.
@klartilkamp @SpitPlease @ShitpostBot5000 No it doesnt.  Dont be a fucking retard.
Imagine being such a blazing fascist that you advocate not allowing a sitting president air time. https://t.co/vBM9vFMWJM
@mattmfm Um, you dont just get to declare that there is no argument.  I dont think hes a racist, so your statement falls flat on its face.
The horror.  Someone pleas help this woman's poor friend... https://t.co/UCIiQSstSw
@ashtonpittman &gt;Pepe the From meme popular with alt-right white supremacists 		You really shouldn't write stuff like this. It makes you look really stupid.
@SRuhle @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You're a liar.  Glass houses and whatnot.
@RepMarkTakano God, nobody cares about your sexual preferences.  Keep that shit to yourself.
@chrislhayes So what you're saying is you dont read the garbage you spew?
@jackiekcalmes @brianstelter You keep saying the "most significant since Watergate"but you know that's disingenuous. The Democrats had much bigger losses in the Clinton and Obama years.
@marstaw1 @brianstelter Lol what do you propose they do about it?
@wilevasims @brianstelter How?
@friendofbillw3 @brianstelter The tribe thought it was funny too...
@patch1000 @brianstelter Oh man, you mean its CURRENT YEAR? Nothing you disagree with should be happening in CURRENT YEAR!!!
@willishl @brianstelter Lol you dont know what a racial slur is. https://t.co/3RScVKeS7j		To be fair, this isnt the left being dumb.  They're once again purposefully moving the goal posts by contorting and perverting the English language.
@JayKlos @brianstelter It's funny that they pretend this is racist then turnn around and make fun of trump for being orange like that's somehow not racist.
@kjpstorm @brianstelter More like, what if a white woman pretending to be black ran?
@brianstelter That's not a racial slur.
@ananavarro Same reason you have a job
So were just going to hear this insufferable shit for 6 years, arent we? Romney will just be another worthless, bloviating Jeff Flake. https://t.co/2G2JVjClLn
@SRuhle Lol "reporting"
@JoeNBC Number 6 is pretty "objectively" false.
@justinsink Oh boy you sure got him now
@LisaD1903 I don't think you have a clue of what you're talking about.
@brianstelter @RyanNobles @CNN I am, hes right...
@SenatorMenendez Yeah but those brothels arent closed! Amirite Bobby boy?
@brianstelter @IngrahamAngle @CNN @MrDanZak @washingtonpost No, you know exactly what you're doing, and being smug about it doesnt obfuscate that fact.  You're purposely trying to rile up your viewers, just like she does - that's the business model.  You're both propagandists, frauds, and disgusting people. #FakeNews
@alterlaw @fakedansavage I guess you're just dumb
@justinstromber2 @fakedansavage This
@jessejamesrich @fakedansavage Oh man big internet tough guy here. If only we were all as tough and cool as you.
Lovely, amazing people. https://t.co/VGrLKTg3Sw
@celerascabin @fakedansavage That's has nothing to do with anything.  What a stupid comparison.
@MouryM @fakedansavage It's actually a fake video but you clearly just want to be outraged.
@steiger_travis @fakedansavage Hey @fakedansavage you gonna respond to this?
@fakedansavage @steiger_travis You know this is not analagous.  You're just comparing it to killing toddlers to get a rise.  Pretty lazy and pathetic, really.
@alterlaw @fakedansavage Looks like somebody couldnt be bothered to do a soogle search...
@Max_Fisher You mean like...the media?
@Max_Fisher Oh.  Now talk about all the lies the NYT spews.
@juanrodpfft You're pretty weird dude
@juanrodpfft Man, you're really a big fan, arent you.  How far back did you go in my feed?
Such a great and wonderful person. https://t.co/uO8wcO244u
@johnleonard512 @StefanMolyneux Ironically, you have proven his point. Thank you.
@TheBeatWithAri @LannyDavis Dude.  Nobody.  Cares.  Give it up.  It's been 3 years and nothing has been found.  You're worse than Alex Jones.
Such a lovely, caring person. https://t.co/jlGqnizUAT
@johnleonard512 @StefanMolyneux Hes talking about current year, moron
@michaelklinger @fakedansavage That makes zero sense.  You dont get to just redefine words.  It also is entirely besides the point.
@CNBC I think @facebook needs to hit back at the media.  Yeah they have problems, but the #msm lies blatantly and repeatedly.  Pot, meet kettle.
@SRuhle Because the entire story is fake...
@CNN I mean, shouldn't it?
@ariannahuff It's not fascinating at all.  You're just a very hateful and dishonest woman.
Twitter is such a cesspool.  Everyone just brigades people they dont agree with and circlejerk with those they do.  On top of this commonly held conservative beliefs will just get you banned.  We need to nuke it from orbit. 		And again, you're all really fucking stupid.
@mucha_carlos @RoKhanna It's not surprising, because the minimum wage is a profoundly stupid policy.
@RoKhanna Hahahaha hea got it all figured out! If we just provide more welfare to the poor, they wont need welfare.  Brilliant!
@RegilioMichael @StefanMolyneux Pls show us where "institutional racism exists.  You cant just say it exists and just insist you're right.  Point to a law, institution, or practice that keeps minorities down.
@johnleonard512 @StefanMolyneux Dude I've never seen a shittier whataboutism argument than this.  The 1960s prove his point.  The real racists then were the ones that justified turning houses on blacks and segregating them.
@RobInBaltimore @fakedansavage Nobody said they were what are you even on about?
@_kylekhaos Science agrees with me
@SBeaudway @fakedansavage If it's legal then it's not poaching by definition
@ezerinis @LorenzoRosso92 @AlongsideWild @fakedansavage Do some reading
@fancynancynyc Why does everyone gloss over the whole "hoping other people die" thing?  You can disagree with trophy hunting &amp; we as a society can even have a discussion about it, but that will never happen as long as people like @fakedansavage are wishing horrible death on people. #BeBetter
@_kylekhaos So there's a rule against thinking that someone who want to change their gender probably has mental illness?  Show me where that is in ToS.
@gabriel_drac @saluce65 @fakedansavage A lot.  And that goes toward conservation, mostly. 		As I said the programs are controversial and I have no doubt some are legit and some are not.
@_kylekhaos I am sorry I have committed wrongthink.  Praise be Big Brother.
@gabriel_drac @saluce65 @fakedansavage The programs are controversial,  sure. But my point is these people dont do this because they're evil.
@RobInBaltimore @fakedansavage Okay, propose something.  The programs are admittedly controversial. I thought the fact that hoping people die is bad wasn't controversial.
@PropMan_ @fakedansavage Distinction without a difference. https://t.co/N1upqXfNRb
@dandrezner Oooh now do the media
@kathygriffin She looks really annoyed at you.
@nievesthad @fakedansavage No, wishing death on someone because they participate in a program you dont understand is sociopathic. You can argue the merits of the program, but you don't have to be a POS about it
@LorenzoRosso92 @fakedansavage No, do a damn google search dude.  Why does everyone want their hand held? Read a little
@AMCUnicorn @DrJenGunter I think there are arguments on both sides.  But wishing death upon people is not okay.
@Yamiche Everyone is making a big deal about everyone leaving town and it just isnt.  They're all on 24 hours notice to come back if there's a vote. Also there are these things called phones and email - they dont have to be in town to negotiate.
Lovely https://t.co/ynvqF6EvcH
@saluce65 @gabriel_drac @fakedansavage You clearly dont understand how these programs work. What's it like to have strong opinions on topics you dont understand?
@MoeLarryJesus Yep.  You got me I'm illiterate.
@juanrodpfft @Cynfulfan @fakedansavage You can beg all you want, doesnt make you less of a garbage person.
@AMCUnicorn @DrJenGunter Only part of my point and yes, that can be argued.  I really take issue with people wishing death upon humans because of a practice they disagree with.
@_kylekhaos @kkossick They're wishing death on human beings because their feelings about a program they dont understand.
@abbydphillip @PressSec Except Republicans passed budgets. Dems didnt. Ball is in their court and you know it, but you work for a propaganda network so you spew this garbage.
Lovely, lovely people. https://t.co/ZhoN51Njb6
@ComoEsto1 @fakedansavage Pundit.  Turd.  Whatever you want to call him.
@Cynfulfan @fakedansavage This is a joke btw.  I dont actually wish harm on anyone because I'm not a piece of shit.
@Cynfulfan @fakedansavage So are you volunteering?  You can help the planet RIGHT NOW!
And there it is.  What a lovely person. https://t.co/NrC30YiOB0
@kkossick It's not.  The point still stand that people are wishing death upon someone because they're doing something they dont agree with.
@gabriel_drac @fakedansavage So you're saying you're too dumb to comprehend conservation programs?  Or too ignorant? Both?
@juanrodpfft @ApriLcarrion @AkkiJ_ @ChrisCrocker @peta No, I just think you're a garbage person.
@AMCUnicorn @DrJenGunter You know absolutely nothing about what you're talking about.
This is what's called "being purposely obtuse"		These "journalists" have the intellect of a 5 year old https://t.co/AeOHeBMQBa
These people are nice. https://t.co/tbMYbHEKcA
@kkossick How do you know it was canned?
These people are nice. https://t.co/GkqRXJ9u0p
@juanrodpfft @ApriLcarrion @AkkiJ_ @ChrisCrocker Humans are not equal to animals.  Are you a @peta nut or something?
You're all really fucking stupid.
@juanrodpfft @ApriLcarrion @AkkiJ_ @ChrisCrocker I guess I just dont wish death on people I dont know.  Call me crazy, I guess.
@lisastark351 @SherriBunch49 Oooh now do the federal reserve.
@kkossick You can be against trophy hunting, but hoping someone gets mauled objectively makes you a bad person.
@DanPatrell Oh no you called me a dirty word.  You have clearly won the argument.
@KrispKiwi @fakedansavage Lol yeah that looked like a "canned lion" to you?
@juanrodpfft @ApriLcarrion @AkkiJ_ @ChrisCrocker I'm not a garbage person that wishes a brutal death on my fellow human beings.  If you're against bullfighting, trophy hunting, that's fine.  But wishing brutal death on someone means you lack a moral compass.
@gusrile Yes
@Adam_PHN @fakedansavage I'm not holding your hand.  Do a google search. Read a little.
@fakedansavage I like how you're glossing over the fact that you're cheering on a person getting mauled by a lion.  I'll bet you're fun at parties.
@OniCamCam @AdamantxYves @deray Yeah I took a whole 2 seconds omg
@fakedansavage What a stupid comparison.
@mtomasky @thedailybeast Hahaha they should pay people to read that trash. #FakeNews
@ApriLcarrion @AkkiJ_ @ChrisCrocker Somebody getting mauled makes you happy? Do you not see how that makes you a garbage person?
@EricVailNaylor2 @AkkiJ_ You clearly know nothing about trophy hunters.  These trips benefit conservation.  Do a basic google search and stop lazily spewing your garbage on the internet.
@fakedansavage You understand that these hunting trips benefit wildlife conservation, right?  Why are you hoping a human being gets mauled? Do you not see how that looks?
@WashTimes Doesnt really mean anything.  That's what they were pushing at the top of their Christmas playlist
@brianstelter Yeah you wouldnt ever LIE, would you?  LYING is very naughty, right, Brian? #FakeNews

@MalcolmNance @justme277 @charliekirk11 This is remarkably stupid. So only people that served can be pro-military?  Get off your high-horse dude.

@nytpolitics If you get your political information from @LinkedIn, you are an abject moron.
@Evan_McMullin Perhaps nobody cares what you think.  Does @cathymcmorris have room for you in her budget this year so you can leech off the taxpayer again?

@burgessev No it doesnt.
@JohnBrennan You have zero credibility
@RepJayapal Now explain the details of their deaths.  You wont, because you're trying to score political points on with dead children.  Stop being a bad person.
@GarrettHaake Are you new in town? There are no votes.  If you need, I can forward you the email saying there are no votes expected and they'll try to give 24 hours notice. 		Or you could just stop lazily sucking at your job. #FakeNews

@Fidelovkurt @ananavarro Oh just shut up already.  So tired of hearing this nonsense.
@ananavarro Why are you posting about a high school fight?  Who tf cares?

@acostrian @NBCNews @andreagrimes It's called propaganda. Almost everything from #FakeNews outlets like NBC regarding race, sexuality, or gender is propaganda designed to enrage the viewers.
@JKDavis5Swords @NBCNews @pablohidalgo It's called propaganda
@NBCNews Wtf does "problematic" mean? Something tells me this "study" is trash.

@brianstelter Haha you're familiar with diabetes, huh?

@HaythamMatthews @secupp Seriously - wtf is "male white nationalism?"
@secupp Wtf is "white male nationalism?" Pretty sure that isnt a real thing.
@ValerieJarrett @idriselba Lol okay tell that to the countless men whose lives have been ruined despite doing nothing wrong.
@ananavarro I wonder how you would feel if there were a lot of tweets about your weight...

@RepJayapal @chrislhayes @CBP @SecNielsen @HouseJudiciary How is this not her parents fault?
@ananavarro @ChrisCuomo Do succubi ever sleep?
@RepJayapal Guys - you cant argue.  She said "end of story" so the debate is over. Pack it up.
@leighmunsil You clowns in the media sure are...
Ask yourself why liberals are liking this tweet praising a supposedly "conservative" publication. Its because neoconservativism was never really conservative. @BillKristol 's dad was the first neocon, who was a self-described "liberal who ha[d] been mugged by reality." #NeoConned https://t.co/qFJIJzzfIo
@RichLowry No, @BillKristol is a shameless hack and his garbage publication will not be missed by anyone with a brain.
@ankylus @RepKarenBass Exactly, we dont have the whole story. 		But that doesnt stop this race-baiter from claiming MUH OPPRESSHUN
@RepKarenBass 1) how are you making this a race thing when one of the officers was clearly black?		2) why was she resisting?  Why dont we hear the whole story before doing your usual race-baiting?
@KatyTurNBC Nobody cares

@RepSpeier @POTUS What, specifically, has he "stolen" from seniors or the disabled?  Surely you're not just making that up...
@WEHOGAYMAN @RepMikeLevin Lol ok dude
@NBCNews Funny that you're not mentioning the almost constant Senate building evacuations happening this week...
@MarkDice @CillizzaCNN He has a misshapen head
@CurtisIngraham1 This is trashy.
@kasie Not as dumb as one of your viewers...
@RepMikeLevin Who are you?
@Independent I didnt know men could have opinions anymore...
@JRubinBlogger Hahaha are you kidding me? This is a blatant lie.
@WalshFreedom Oh hop off it. You literally yelled at your constituents in a town hall.
@thehill Lol this will surely be the end of drumpf.
@voxdotcom You mean "white supremacists," you illiterate hacks		If he had "ties to white supremacy" then you would be assuming that there is a rea thing called "white supremacy."		"White supremacists" believe in "white supremacism" which teaches that "white supremacy" is real. Morons.
@ananavarro @AlCardenasFL_DC Oh look - she doesnt know what the word "bigotry" means.  How cute, she thinks she's a journalist...
This is amazing.  He cant actually be serious. https://t.co/YCk7h3oPHC

@CuomoPrimeTime @ananavarro Wow.  This is unwatchable. To the people that actually watch this and enjoy it: what is wrong with you? When is the last time you saw a therapist?		@CNN wouldn't produce this trash if nobody watched it.  This is your fault.
@politico @BillKristol is an abject loser
@Alyssa_Milano You're still not relevant to anything. Go reboot charmed or Gilmore girls or whatever you were on.
@ananavarro You know you're a clown, right?
@JesseRodriguez Stop making stuff up. Either it exists or it doesnt and people tired of the schrodinger's evidence garbage.
@lisastark351 You're delusional. Only a fascist would want to remove a sitting president that has done nothing wrong.
@NaphiSoc @TheBeatWithAri @LisaM3732 @RWPUSA But then you would actually have to prove it was illegal first.  Which you haven't. Which makes this a fascist, anti-democratic statement.
@SRuhle @FoxNews Yeah you actually dont get to decide who gets a platform and who doesn't.  This tweet is basically what a fascist would say...
@MotherJones Go. Away.
@RawStory No they arent #FakeNews
@NaphiSoc @TheBeatWithAri @LisaM3732 @RWPUSA You do realize this is something a fascist would say, right?
@irawinkler @paulkrugman @Ocasio2018 Show me where they are doing that. What bill are you referring to?  Surely you wouldn't just be making stuff up...
@Jorebungley @paulkrugman @Ocasio2018 @ARanganathan72 That's the thing about being a smug prick - it almost always comes back to bite you.
@paulkrugman @Ocasio2018 Strawman. That's was ONE congressman. Also, you're irrelevant.

@JonBowzerBauman @KirstenPowers @NancyPelosi What needs to stop is garbage white-knighting like you're doing right now.  This isnt a real problem. People interrupt people of both genders. Stop being a baby about it.
@TruthWrite @KirstenPowers @ClaraJeffery Mansplaining is a sexist term
Amazing how many "strong" women constantly complain about small things like being interrupted. Men get interrupted to, but they dont go onto Twitter and feign victimhood about it. #FakeNews #Pathetic https://t.co/yjrQigl2US
@ananavarro Oh and like you're a paragon of honestly... 🙄
@KirstenPowers Nobody cares.  Stop playing the victim. Gee, "strong" women sure seem to complain a lot!
@yankefan @JRubinBlogger This is a pretty sexist comment right here

@DesignationSix @IngrahamAngle @Cabelas @BassProShops @FoxNews Enough with the stupid boycotts.
@kaitlancollins You look really petty, saying stuff like this.
@NPRinskeep @nytopinion @BretStephensNYT I think this means the author is the one without a sense of humor.  How tone def and out-of-touch can the @nytimes get? #FakeNews

@RosieGray Glad to know you're the ultimate arbiter of what our takeaway should be. Why dont you womansplain some more to us?
@RosieGray It's not that simple. False assault/harassment accusations have been weaponized, and they are widespread. Men are starting to actively avoid women in their professional lives for this reason. Ironically, #metoo set women back more than anyone could have imagined.

@sarahcpr @JaneMayerNYer @xeni Nope.  That's not what the poll said.  Its said 45% are "very comfortable" so it doesn't include those that are just "somewhat comfortable" or any other subsets of comfortable.		You need to be honest with your sexism.
@yousparkypants @RepSpeier @PrincessBravato the hell are you even talking about?

@AmirAminiMD Cuck
@NARAL Shut up, commieS
Why are so many #InternationalMensDay posts focused on men being more sensitive and vulnerable? wtf https://t.co/0KiW1gyjS3
@ProudResister "Are you man enough to be subjective to women?"		GTFO with this bullshit
@ChelleDoggo No they arent.
@CorbynistaTeen "Toxic masculinity" is a made-up term meant to stigmatize masculinity. Sure, men can cry, but being traditionally masculine is okay, too.
@brettt0mlin Shut the fuck up
@tvmanoise No.  Stop fucking hijacking this for .0001% of the population.
@Saisailu97 "Toxic masculinity" isnt real. You're just stigmatizing masculinity
This is so massively sexist. Why are so many posts on #InternationalMensDay like this? If it were #InternationalWomensDay and I said women should not be emotional, people would lose their minds. https://t.co/9sY52qZnEf
People need to stop attacking @Ocasio2018 - it makes you look dumb and petty.
@RepJayapal @Ocasio2018 That's doesnt mean anything.
Yeah @danielchaitin7 I would actually 100% agree.  I'm no fan of @Ocasio2018 but making fun of her attire is out of line.  Many staffers have holes in their pants and holes in their shoes - and I'd even go so far as to say all the good ones do. https://t.co/9AOZD55nsd

@sangerkatz @greg_fann @nickconfessore The sad part is you probably know this. CBO's job is to put price tags on legislation and not to make judgement calls like this.  You're purposely misleading your audience for the sake sake of a political agenda. You know waivers would be politically perilous.
@sangerkatz @greg_fann @nickconfessore No, CBO picked that situation for the sake of estimating cost.

@Plantsmantx @xsf19705 @OptimisticRs @TheEconomist See my reply before further smugness, please.
@hotbloodedeq @ranene54 @womensmarch @realDonaldTrump I've read the article. It even says in the article that they didnt end any grant program, they awarded it to different groups, partially because 3 groups turned it down because they dont like trump.		Now, what was that about me being an idiot?
@barstoolsports thats disgusting tbh.  isn't she like 70?
@ArthurSchwartz Hate.  It was about hate.
@TheEconomist R.I.P. The Economist's credibility
@SoFar20XX @womensmarch @realDonaldTrump You didn't present any facts.  The only thing you presented was your clear ignorance of how the government works.
@11thHour @TheRickWilson if you invite that clown @TheRickWilson on your show, you shouldn't be taken seriously.  He has made a career on being an anti-Trump hack.
@SoFar20XX @womensmarch @realDonaldTrump He has repeatedly denounced white supremacists and all forms of hate.  Dont be an idiot.
@SoFar20XX @womensmarch @realDonaldTrump I don't know what to tell you.  That's not how it works.  This is really shitty "journalism"
@SoFar20XX @womensmarch @realDonaldTrump my understanding is that they got a grant, and they're not getting it this year.  @womensmarch somehow twisted that into @realDonaldTrump and the admin not caring about white supremacist violence.  absolutely dishonest and disgusting partisanship.
@kurteichenwald Something something tentacle porn...
@SoFar20XX @womensmarch @realDonaldTrump Excluded =/= not awarded a competitive grant
@siegelka @EgSophie @womensmarch @realDonaldTrump They cant just cancel a program.  They just gave it to someone else, in part because 3 organizations turned it down.		You're either ignorant to how Congress works, or you're spreading lies.
@SoFar20XX @womensmarch @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/NP8jij1yam
@siegelka @EgSophie @womensmarch @realDonaldTrump An appropriation of funds must be made by Congress. Period. They may be referring to the recipients' "program" but the executive branch cant just cancel funding like that.
@NYTNational because morons like you keep pretending they're somehow more dangerous than shotguns...
@chelseahandler nobody cares what you think
@shalisemyoung @RawStory yeah thats not what he said, is it?
@siegelka @EgSophie @womensmarch @realDonaldTrump They are not allowed to create or cancel grant programs thats not how any of this works.  Read the article - the just awarded it to someone different, in part because 3 groups turned to down.
@RussellShackle @womensmarch @realDonaldTrump They're blatantly lying on this.  See my tweet above.
This is a tremendously pathetic lie, even for @womensmarch - even if you agree with them politically you should not buy into this dishonest propaganda.  They are using you to raise money.  They are complete and utter frauds. https://t.co/YYp61fxP7f
@ranene54 @womensmarch @realDonaldTrump He didn't actually stop any program.  This is a blatant lie.
@SoFar20XX @womensmarch @realDonaldTrump They can't cancel a grant, they just awarded it to someone else.  In an article posted in response it even says they tried to award it to the same people and some groups turned it down "citing political disagreements with the Trump administration."  What a pathetic lie.
@EgSophie @womensmarch @realDonaldTrump Further, it even says in the article that "three recipients confirmed that they had declined the grants, all citing political disagreements with the Trump administration."		This is absolutely pathetic - you should be ashamed of your ignorance and/or dishonesty.
@EgSophie @womensmarch @realDonaldTrump Yep - this is a complete lie.  The administration can't "cancel a grant" program.  That would require an act of congress.  What this says is that they simply awarded the grant to a different group - something that happens all the time.  How dishonest.
@ChrisMurphyCT He's right though.  Ask the PM of Honduras.
@womensmarch @realDonaldTrump This is a complete lie.  Cite the program that you're talking about.
@MSNBC This looks far worse on the kids than him.

@bpolitics I dont like him either but he does NOT support white nationalism. Show me where he expresses support for an ethnostate or delete this tweet #FakeNews
@adamnagourney @jennymedina lol yeah great idea bet you'll love it when they break the crack pipe out.
@CNNSitRoom &gt;Regardless of whether they supported this particular act		Nope.  Stop right there.  You don't get to play the guilt by association game.  You probably share some beliefs with Hitler, but that doesn't mean you two have anything to do with each other.  What a stupid thing to say.
@GlblCtzn Dumb
@brianstelter @TheLeadCNN Still illustrates how out-of-touch and hateful the clowns on CNN are
@brianstelter You've been leading a hate campaign against half the country for years.  Get off that high horse.
@CillizzaCNN you're right - this is CNN level stupidity.
@lolsi91 @PhilipRucker It was
@GenuineDCR @PhilipRucker I mean, yeah. That's why he was elected.
@DavidNakamura "Potentially strip asylum protections for migrants"		Nope.  This is a blatant lie.
@DaxSmith5 @dabeard @goldengateblond That would be unconstitutional
@OtagOnline @EqualsQ @TheOfficialPORP @tread_don @NBCNews @CNN @realDonaldTrump That'd a distinction without a difference. And yes, you were complaining about a meme.
@OtagOnline @EqualsQ @TheOfficialPORP @tread_don @NBCNews You're literally sitting here complaining about a meme while @CNN is blaming a terrorist attack carried out by a Trump-hating person on @realDonaldTrump - just think about that for a minute dude.
@OtagOnline @EqualsQ @TheOfficialPORP @tread_don @NBCNews The people that believe it are dumb
@shannonrwatts I wonder what it feels like to use the fear of losing a child to fundraise for your own paycheck...
@benshapiro Not with you on this one, Ben. The #msm is pure evil and they know exactly what they're doing.
@OtagOnline @EqualsQ @TheOfficialPORP @tread_don @NBCNews Do you seriously still not understand that meme? Case in point...
@NBCNews So if they're born a hermaphrodite, gender reassignment is wrong, but if they're born Male or female it's okay? I cant keep track of what the marxists are saying is acceptable today.
@TrustyShellback @NBCNews It's very rare and not a normal occurrence
@kylegriffin1 They do not represent Johnstown. Most of them will still be voting Republican. You know that though, you are purposely misrepresenting that community.
@jonallendc If you're quoting it, why wouldn't you just retweet it? Is it maybe because you're grossly misrepresenting it?
@vengeful_librar @CarolinaBowen @jeffhauser @joanwalsh no, it just sound like you're mentally and emotionally unstable.
@JohnJHarwood pot, meet kettle
@vengeful_librar @CarolinaBowen @jeffhauser @joanwalsh Who hurt you?
@vengeful_librar @CarolinaBowen @jeffhauser @joanwalsh I'll be you're fun at parties. 		Do you have any idea how foolish and hateful you sound?
@vengeful_librar @CarolinaBowen @jeffhauser @joanwalsh Implementing? Tell me when, exactly, that law was enacted...
@RawStory #fakeNews
Fun fact: @georgesoros does not represent the #JewishCommunity and its okay to criticize him and not be an #antisemite - any attempt to connect the two is lazy at best.
@Dsquared75 @jeffhauser @joanwalsh You really have no idea how the executive branch works do you? The DHS secretary doesnt tell DoJ what to do.		Also the PM of Honduras has told @VP that leftists, particularly from Venevuela, have been funding the caravans.
@CarolinaBowen @jeffhauser @joanwalsh What an ingornat and hateful thing to say.  You're consuming far too much propaganda.
@HuffPost I thought she died like 10 years ago...
@CBSNews @CBSSunday @mauriceduboistv why are you still talking about this?
@NBCNews wtf - this isn't even a story.  This is just "right wingers are anti-semites" and "heres a guy that we call an expert, he says so.		This is lazy.
Finally.  They have to admit it. https://t.co/dGrSdjaR6G

@HuffPost That's not a man. That's that thing from Total Recall
@Laural4705 @MariaResist @chelseahandler They just insult when they dont know what to say. You know, like a child.
@MariaResist @Laural4705 @chelseahandler That's pretty sexist actually
@LindaMLC @chelseahandler @UnfollowTrump @UnfollowVP They dont care
@NancySinatra @chelseahandler Are there still brain cells in there or is it just callogen now?
#UnhingedLeft are now legitimately arguing that the American people shouldn't hear from @POTUS @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/Kq91u0hbyu

@y2roby @CleverTitleTK Ok I looked.  What was I supposed to see?
@scottbudman @getongab Honestly, @PayPal is scum.  Never do business with them.
I cant imagine thinking like these "journalists" - a tragedy like this happens and their first thought is self-promition and how to hit @realDonaldTrump
@TheRickWilson Yeah you're a real barrel of monkeys yourself.
@LBraun1912 @jaketapper Like it or not, they do. He's your president.
@d_mccarthy37 @jaketapper Greatest president of our lifetime
@cf_carl @jaketapper So you call him names? Read what you just wrote.

@Angrifon @jeffhauser @joanwalsh So they're not doing their job if they don't monitor everyone and arrest all the crazy people?  You're really determined to be right, but you should really just stop digging.  You look like an idiot.
@shaunking I directly blame you for the rise of anti-white racism and hatred.
@Angrifon @jeffhauser @joanwalsh You look like a buffoon saying stuff like this.
@DebiFranklin1 You're not very smart are you?
@banaifeldstein Trump has never said any such thing.  You're a horrible person.
@shannonrwatts now  mention that a vast majority are actually suicides...
Take note of everyone in the #MSM blaming @realDonaldTrump for a shooting carried out by a man that hated Trump.  They are your enemy - and they absolutely hate you. #Pittsburgh #synagogueshooting #SquirrelHill
@CleverTitleTK You might want to be careful being this much of a partisan hack.  This guy was just an anti-semite.  period.  He hated trump.  Try to be a better person.
@Angrifon @jeffhauser @joanwalsh So you have no specifics, because you're just being a hack?		I don't think you even have the slightest idea of how DHS works.
@jeffhauser @joanwalsh What, specifically, would you like her to do that she's not doing?  or are you just being a partisan hack and scoring cheap political points while people are rushed to the hospital?  Do you sleep well at night?
@tedlieu @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump @POTUS You're a horrible person
@AymanM @joanwalsh You might want to be careful posting shit like this right after a tragedy.

@CillizzaCNN "This is CNN.  And we could not be more evil"		FTFY
@abstractpatina @shaunking no i need liberals to stop lying about a horrific tragedy to score cheap political points.  its disgusting
@Turnt_Hippie @TheSquatPenSF @shaunking Then using that evil to score cheap political points is also evil.  If you don't think so you should reconsider how you behave
@Turnt_Hippie @TheSquatPenSF @shaunking people politicizing this and blaming trump while he clearly hated trump.
@DebiFranklin1 Then comment on his tweet, not mine, moron.
@caravaggibro @KenAshford @davidmackau @deray you're not discussing this honestly so im done with you.
@bigpictoor @shaunking Whataboutism is not an argument.
@abstractpatina @shaunking He hated trump, moron.
@TheSquatPenSF @shaunking right back at you.  You're evil.
@shaunking you're a liar
@caravaggibro @KenAshford @davidmackau @deray someone on site clearly responds faster than police.  What are you even talking about?  You're being purposely obtuse.  Stop.
@Nikki_Mert @quinncy There are a lot of NPCs to respond to
@DebiFranklin1 name one that would have prevented this
@CNN CNN is legitimately evil.  Take note.

@KenAshford @caravaggibro @davidmackau @deray i'm not saying it would solve the problem.  evil will always exist.  		"and you know this" - what are you even trying to say here?  That i'm somehow lying?  what are you even on about?
@TheMeg12 @quinncy hurr durr trump ppl r dumb amirite guise?
@debimuch do they hurt?  what is wrong with you?
@BuffaloSweat you're a bad person.  he doesn't support white supremacists.  reconsider how you treat people.
@lowpex3 no he didn't.  the president doesn't "sign on" to legislation - you clearly don't know the basics of how government works.
@caravaggibro @davidmackau @deray armed guards are not the same as police responding.  guards prevent, police react.  David is purposely ignoring this fact to score political points, which is something a bad person would do.
absolute degenerate https://t.co/FiguWmMnkH
@quinncy what the actual fuck are you talking about?
@AliVelshi AR-15 style?  what the hell does that mean?  Thats a specific model.

@quinncy wow, you're a piece of shit
@shannonrwatts @NRA no there weren't.  this is an outright lie and you're either dumb enough to spew it or evil enough to make it up.
@SenatorMenendez stop politicizing it.  you're going to lose your election then you cant get anymore underage prostitutes
Het democrats and media - take note: this is how you respond.  Don't politicize it. https://t.co/YMyNUPdIjE
@JaredHuffman no, whats shameless is your attempt to score political points while the bodies aren't even cold yet.  you're a bad person.
@davidmackau @deray yeah but they responded.  they werent there at the onset.
@brianschatz @RepJerryNadler how do you propose you eliminate an entire ideology?  would you like a few rainbows to go with that?
no he didn't you liars
@aravosis @SherriBunch49 stop
@RepJerryNadler you're a legitimately bad person.  just say it's a tragedy, wish the best for the families, and don't politicize it.  the guy hated trump.  but you don't care - because you're a bad person.
@MccordJavon @SaysSimonson @KyleKashuv except he never said that you hack
@davidharsanyi @seanmdav You're a bad person. You should reconsider how you live.

@Smile_Martini @DanielleMuscato Give me an example or I'm no taking you seriously.

@DanielleMuscato The irony is this kind of garbage is exactly why you lost the election.
@JakeTCannon @greekcelt @NewYorker Doesnt disprove my point.  The world was much bigger.
@CeeBee @NewYorker I dont think you understand the point of that story...
@chrisbobgrey @NewYorker White people didnt identify as such until racist marxists started shitting on them nonstop
@chrisbobgrey @NewYorker Okay.  So what?
@CeeBee @NewYorker Wow, that's really fucking racist. Fuck you.
@RobinRobinjoan @ChelseaClinton No. #SmugLiberal
@EJohnSchmidt @greekcelt @NewYorker Yep, this is exactly what I expected. You're really hateful.
@JakeTCannon @greekcelt @NewYorker Or maybe it was because they didnt have cars or twitter.  They didn't know who else was on the planet. 		Read some history dude.
@ChelseaClinton "Bomb"		Stop lying
@dogstar7tweets I never fucking said that. You can be white and not be a white supremacist. Conversely, you can be proud of European culture without being a hateful Marxist. You guys need to stop shitting on western culture and white people.
@kylegriffin1 Wouldn't that apply better to Democrats? 🤔
@greekcelt @NewYorker So were showers and electricity.  What's your point?
@charliespiering @brianstelter It's just nonstop with you liars.

@Jfriedmanmagic @abbydphillip @Acosta Funny how all you hacks dont wait a second to blame Trump.		Maybe have some decency and wait for the facts. Looks fake tbh
If you are generalizing all Trump supporters based on these "bombs," you are a bad person. If you blame trump, you're a bad person. If you are outraged today but didnt condemn the person that sent Trump ricin recently, you're a hypocrite and a bad person.

@ktumulty @PhilipRucker It's absolutely disgusting that you're blaming him.

@JesseLehrich @sahilkapur Also put it in the context that someone sent ricin to Trump and the Pentagon not long ago
@DavidAFrench I'd bet anything a liberal did this so they could claim they're victims. They have a history of that...

@m_dicey @trumpmatized @abbydphillip @joshscampbell Did you?  You're the one making wild assumptions about his motives.
@CiceroTJones @abbydphillip This is why it doesnt make sense and is probably made up

@BBCNews nobody cares.  he's nobody
@fleshth @thehill Right.  It requires he nominate them.  It doesn't require the @senatemajldr to have a hearing.  Again - you clearly don't know what the rule of law means, or how legal text is applied.
@morocha44 @11Nigeltufnel @thehill what a silly comment. At no point did I say a wall solves everything &amp; your hyperbole on just shutting down travel is laughable. Biometrics, better tracking of visas, and improved e-verify are all viable options. Its unserious people like you that prevent solutions to the problem
@fleshth @thehill What part of the constitution requires the senate majority leader to have a hearing on this subject?
@StefanMolyneux no, no, no - the T word is reserved for cheeto men that talked to a russian once on his campaign about how transexuals shouldn't be in the military reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
@washingtonpost I'm getting really sick of you guys reporting this stuff like it's national news.  You don't report when it's the other way around, but I see that far more often. A one-on-one interaction is almost never a national story unless you're pushing an agenda.
@fleshth @thehill I don't think yo know what "rule of law" means...
@ursorrynotsorry @thehill I don't see a wall
@11Nigeltufnel @thehill why though?  think about it - are you saying that you want illegal immigration?  why would you actively tear the wall down?
@1911Spartan @thehill it's #FakeNews - nobody is actually considering this
@thehill I can tell you that literally nobody is talking about this.

#racism is okay if it's against white people, apparently. https://t.co/hMo3qwS2Po
@Carroll_3avv So youre cool with racism?  How do you square that in your head?  Reverse that situation - how quickly would I be condemned I'd I said you deserved something like that. Disgusting		I wasnt complaining, I was using it as evidence of a purposeful narrative by segments of the media.
@EluxTroxl @thehill The hill isnt a news outlet. They're trash
@Ebonafied @thehill Right because black women never behave badly...🙄
@thehill Unfollow @thehill - race baiting propagandists
@RawStory Haha Haha #FakeNews
@Carroll_3avv I dont have video because I'm not an attention-seeker looking for magic internet points with evidence of "muh oppression" - I'm not a victim (nobody in the US is) and will never act like one.
@SherriBunch49 Problem is they were offered asylum by Mexico and they refused...
@theretheirthere @thehill But they're selective in what they report. I've many times had black people hurl racist insults at me, but that never makes the news because it doesnt fit the preferred narrative.
@SherriBunch49 I'll bet you $10 it magically shows up at the border right before the election.
@RawStory $10 says a liberal org did this

@__Arthur_Dent__ @nycsouthpaw Why would a racist have a black friend?
@msmeganl @nycsouthpaw @MerriamWebster Nope.  Look it up.  You dont know what it means.
@theretheirthere @thehill It happens no more frequently then it ever has. There are shitty people out there, but when you cherry pick local events like this, you create the impression that it happens all the time.  It doesnt.  Most people are not racist and dont act like this. 		This is propaganda.
@CillizzaCNN God this story is old.		Move on.

@therushilsingh @NYTScience If politely asked, that would be one thing, but you're dealing with mentally ill people that have been told to be proud of their illness - which is dangerous. They rarely ask politely as they have been reinforced in their erratic behavior. Usually they scream "dont misgender me!"
So the @nytimes is able to publish garbage pseudoscience like this, but @Twitter limits my account when I point out that trans people have a mental disorder?  @jack can you explain to me why twitter is siding with the PC police over the scientific community? https://t.co/qECvXwnHb5

@gman007bond @KenGilbert2 @Ocasio2018 I studied WWII extensively.  Comparing someone to a Nazi for any reason aside from, lets say, committing a holocaust, gassing POWs/civilians, publicly executing political dissidents, or attempting to take over the world by military force is just stupid, lazy, and offensive.

@Vanessa1971 @thehill Why not?  People have said this from the beginning. It's just math. 25/33 incumbents are dems this year.
@HillaryWarnedU @thehill Clickbait is all the Hill doesn. I would suggest unfollowing them.
@Shaken0Stirred @thehill It's all garbage tbh. Dont believe polls
@AdrianArancibia @thehill They're trying to convince liberals they need to vote.		Its objective fact that dems are likely to lose in the Senate. 25/33 incumbents are dems this year.
@thehill Anyone that's honest has said this would happen from the beginning.		Stop following @thehill - they do not report real news. 		#FakeNews
@dailykos Anyone with a sign that says "protect trans kids" should be red-flagged for the @FBI
@HuffPost But shouldn't you be outraged?  This is cultural appropriation!
@Dander_Bogaerts @Ocasio2018 Yep.  On both sides, too. Be very skeptical, and expect to get no real info until Nov 7th.  I've considered logging out if I didn't need to know what the propaganda is.
@SRuhle @realDonaldTrump Um, the House already passed this.  All it would take is for the Senate to come back in session for one week.  But you know this.  You're projecting because you know you' are actually lying. #FakeNews
@Dander_Bogaerts @Ocasio2018 It won't significantly affect anyone in any way.  Its just a misleading story to stir faux outrage.  You're going to get a lot of that over the next couple weeks.
I hope Congress calls @jack in for another hearing, but take the gloves off this time. I assume they're waiting to see what happens in the upcoming SCOTUS case.
Ironically, this tweet didnt post the first time I made it. It's nowhere in my failed tweets or drafts. 		Here's an example of what they're doing: https://t.co/73vyFA2JYC
Conservatives dont just have a problem with @Twitter outright silencing them by suspending their account. Many times they simply rate-limit conservatives that arent breaking the rules, handicapping them and many times causing them to give up using the platform in any serious way.

@instrospective1 This is exactly what I'm talking about. Obviously both sides have compassion for all human beings - that a completely meaningless thing to say.  Conservatives think.its mental illness and it should be treated. Painting that as a lack of compassion is ignorant and wrong.

@CHardyPeeres @CNN @SarahKSilverman @SenTomCotton Explain how you would have a right to someone's labor and expertise.
@willishl @martee22 @CNN @SenTomCotton That is a distinction without a different.  You know how legislation works?  The AHCA that they tried to pass amended parts of the ACA and the tax legislation that followed shortly after, and it repealed other parts.  The original legislation amended existing law.
@KellyO @realDonaldTrump It's also not compelling or interesting to report on.
@NotSara_Sarah @jennifrancoise @RawStory Further, historical context is important here and something you should be sympathetic to - nobody on either side has regularly done townhalls since Gabbby Giffords was shot.
@NotSara_Sarah @jennifrancoise @RawStory Townhalls are not helpful - they just highlight the loudest and often most ignorant citizens.  If you call your member of congress, they actually aggregate that. They are constantly gauging their district to inform their votes.  Why wouldn't they?  they want to win reelection.
@CNNPolitics Not tell your viewers why they were thrown out.  I'll wait.
@NotSara_Sarah @jennifrancoise @RawStory Nobody is refusing to talk to constituents.  Call you member of congress any day of the week.  Townhalls are stupid, and you know it.  They are just yelling sessions and not productive.		How can you possibly think this behavior is okay?

@oweniverson @thehill Also, I think you're just bad at vocabulary. You said "bigot" when you meant "prejudice" - and you're absolutely right: I'm prejudiced against people that spew the toxic, nonsensical, racist shit that you have been tweeting.  Words mean things dude. https://t.co/gJFrVnG0QC
@oweniverson @thehill "You disagree with me and didnt respond to my ad hominem attack so you're clearly ignorant."		You're pathetic dude.
@oweniverson @thehill I think it's funny that you're calling my sources and knowledge into question. That's called ad hominem and is not an argument. Did you learn that in gender studies?		Nobody takes people like you seriously because you act like children and have to redefine words to win arguments.
@oweniverson @thehill Nope. You dont get to just redefine words. Assuming someone has privilege because they're white is not only ignorant and inaccurate, it's the epitome of racism. https://t.co/9ky36aGOIl

@RawStory This is stupid you should be embarrassed to publish garbage like this. 🚮
@willsigner74 @thehill Wow, some real 3rd grade stuff here. Really impressed.
@SurtChilling @thehill She doesnt have to be security. All residents are told to not let anyone in. Residents use the keypad/keyfob.   I agree she should have just closed the door, but it looks like he was hiding it open. You're so determined to believe this is racism that you're not being objective.
@okkie48 @kylegriffin1 Name one actual crime.

@JacksonLeeTX18 @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP @POTUS @HouseDemocrats How much have premiums and deductibles gone up since then?
@SurtChilling @thehill If I have to explain how apartment building security works, this conversation is a waste of time. You should be more aware of your confirmation bias..
@SurtChilling @SenKamalaHarris None of that is even close to accurate. You're just making stuff up
@willsigner74 @thehill Because its damaging to public discourse. What a stupid question.
@oweniverson @thehill I am white and I hold no special privilege. Saying I inherently have privilege due to my race is textbook racism.
@ConcernedFruit @justmyowndrama @thehill Shouldn't. But is.
@ConcernedFruit @justmyowndrama @thehill Kinda not the point....
@oweniverson @thehill Ironically, assuming that I'm privileged is very prejudiced. Project much?
@SurtChilling @thehill When you live in apartment building, you're not supposed to let people in without using their keyfob. She probably went overboard but that was probably because he was trying to shove past her without using it. He was also clearly seeking attention, since he had his phone out.
@oweniverson @thehill Data doesnt point to racism. In fact, it points to the opposite.
@oweniverson @thehill It's clear that you're in your own little world. Life outside the gender studies class will be hard for you.
@SurtChilling @SenKamalaHarris That's not how budgeting works at all. Ss &amp; Medicare are funded by their own payroll tax.		This is a fake issue that magically comes up every 2 years so dems can scare seniors, who typically vote Republican.
@oweniverson @thehill Actually I personally know some white people that did exactly that and they went to prison. Cops largely dont care what race you are - pulling people over means more money.
@oweniverson @thehill No we arent, that's absurd. Nobody is significantly disadvantaged in this country by anyone or anything but their own communities.
@oweniverson @thehill Yes, actually. Drug laws are what I believe to be the only real "institutional racism" that exists. I would support repealin fun them.  But this instance has nothing to do with this issue. This dude was just a moron willfully ignoring laws.
@thehill Honestly we need to just stop giving the Hill clicks. They are a trash #FakeNews outlet that only publishes lazy click-bait articles that are just rewrites of other articles but with less information. 		🚮
@Garywv53Gary @Aevans5858 @CassieSays_1 @thehill Hahaha wtf are you even talking about?  You're just making shit up.
@Aevans5858 @thehill This. Thank you.
@SurtChilling @PeterDawsonUSA @thehill Legally yes, its justified by statute.
@ConcernedFruit @thehill No it isnt. Like it or not it's still illegal in many states.
@oweniverson @thehill Institutionalized racism us as real as the tooth fairy, and even if it were real, it would have nothing to do with this instance.

@Tiskel2000 @Milliennial The irony of this statement is absolutely amazing.  Zero self-awareness.
@Tiskel2000 @Milliennial The irony of this comment is amazing...
@Milliennial I hope when you're older you gain some self awareness...
@Milliennial So, the map is worthless.  Got it.		And you criticize my manners?  Do you not hear yourself?  This thread thoroughly illustrates why millineals are a joke.
@Milliennial Those are not mutually exclusive. I said your map means nothing because no demographic will ever have that level of turnout. Are you going to dispute this, or act like a child?
@Milliennial See, an adult would offer a counter point. And you wonder why millennials arent taken seriously...
@Milliennial I figured you wouldn't actually address my comment...
@Milliennial If boomers all turned out this would be all red. No demographic has even close to 100% turnout never will. This means absolutely nothing. 		Ironically this post shows exactly how out of touch millenials are with reality.
Look at how massively out of touch this is... https://t.co/6YwpMqa6gV

@pinkblush99 @La_Lizard @MarthaMcSally @azcentral You never reposted https://t.co/h6M9dNmIQr arguments, so I can only logically conclude that you support sex trafficking. I asked you if you had a better system in mind, and you didnt provide shit. Learn how to discuss things like an adult.
@pinkblush99 @La_Lizard @MarthaMcSally @azcentral Why do you support sex trafficking children?
Sometimes I think I'm too mean on here, then I scroll down a bit and am reminded at how fucking stupid you all are.
@Yourpetcat @ForecasterEnten GOP incumbents have gone above and beyond to either differentiate themselves from POTUS and the party, or they've run toward him depending on the district.  There is no "generic" Republican this cycle. People actually looking at this instead of repeating TPs know this.
@sarah_grossman @HuffPost Stupid

@newestendeavor @thehill Funny how I have to go to "show additional comments" before I see anyone that isn't a liberal shill. 		Surely that isn't by design, right @jack?
@GracieThunders @stewartevers @thehill Explain this. Who do you think is making money off this?
@CillizzaCNN "Accuse your enemy of that which you are guilty of"
@La_Lizard @pinkblush99 @MarthaMcSally @azcentral 1) I dont watch Fox. They're garbage. 		2) if my arguments are stupid, why dont you debunk them?  Should be easy if they're bad arguments, right?  Instead you've done nothing but attack me personally.		3) Assuming everyone that disagrees with you is a bad person is not very cool.
@La_Lizard @pinkblush99 @MarthaMcSally @azcentral No we arent. Almost all of these kids have been reunited.		If you oppose separation, you absolutely support the sex trafficking of children, and it's disgusting. Children will suffer their entire lives because clowns like you are getting manipulated by the media and your party.
@CillizzaCNN Said the propaganda artist.
@peterbakernyt @carlottagall @ddknyt So, unconfirmed?  So probably shouldn't be reported until verified?
@thehill Which is useless and tells us nothing.
@WalshFreedom He didnt sat that. You know better.

@SusanofTexas You're right, if nothing changes I'll never see SS, but that has nothing to do with @SenMajLdr
@briangerard13 @voxdotcom True, but that's not a "cut"		Also literally nobody in the GOP is proposing that.
@sarihurtig It is an entitlement. That's a budgetary term. Anger and ignorance combined arent a good look.
@BLeeForCongress You're lying. Be a better person.
@EcoSurfer @googlenews No he didnt
@bluenote74 "Entitlement" is a budgetary term referring to mandatory spending you moron.
@SusanofTexas No he isn't. Stop making shit up.
@meeaz Literally nobody supports cutting social security or Medicare.  Nobody.
@A12Cents No he didnt
@blackeb2001 No, they're not doing that. This is a lie that comes up every cycle
@lucky2beluke @atDavidHoffman Nobody is cutting social security or Medicare.
@BGulsby He absolutely didnt say that. Lying is wrong.
@ErnestineByrd17 No he doesnt, liar
@SueCMamaSue @foxandfriends @FoxNews Nobody is cutting social security, stop spreading lies.
@barbtail0 @TLuke06 @SenKamalaHarris Looks like you dont know how AS works.  You cant cut it, its mandatory spending funded through separate payroll taxes. Nobody wants to cut it even if they could.

@briangerard13 @voxdotcom It doesnt mean "cut" because you cant cut mandatory spending...
@pinkblush99 @La_Lizard @MarthaMcSally @azcentral That's not what whataboutism means. It's not a strawman either because I'm asking, not assuming your position. Interesting that you're attacking me instead of answering
This is a blatant lie. @voxdotcom is #FakeNews garbage. https://t.co/KIkqcxRjlD
@voxdotcom No. They. Dont. 		Stop lying.
@kaitlancollins Why would he answer that?  You know better. Stop embarrassing us on an international level.
@pinkblush99 @La_Lizard @MarthaMcSally @azcentral What about them? They have to be processed too (keep in mind they are still entering illegally).  Are you suggesting that we should ignore sex trafficking so the 75% not being trafficked dont have to be separated for a few days?
@CillizzaCNN At the very least, the last 2 are 100% true.  You know better.
@La_Lizard @pinkblush99 @MarthaMcSally @azcentral That's exactly what's happening. Liberals have protested while ICE was trying to break up sex trafficking rings. Over a quarter of these kids coming over the border have been rescued from slavery due to "child separation."		So I ask again, why do you support trafficking kids?

@La_Lizard @pinkblush99 @MarthaMcSally @azcentral They separate them to question them and catch sex traffickers.  Why do you support sex trafficking of children?
@La_Lizard @pinkblush99 @MarthaMcSally @azcentral Wow.  I had never considered that. Thank you for your insight.

@La_Lizard @pinkblush99 @MarthaMcSally @azcentral How very astute.  Go on, you're very convincing.
@SherriBunch49 @kylegriffin1 Same.  And to be fair I'm usually not this rational 😜
@SherriBunch49 @kylegriffin1 I would argue if more things were handled on a state level, we would fight less. Californians could largely govern themselves in a more liberal way while Texans could do their thing too
@SherriBunch49 @kylegriffin1 Senators used to be elected by state governments.  They were meant to represent the states and the house represented the people directly.  Since we've had direct election of senators, retention has been higher and nobody pays attention to state politics. So everything is federal
@SherriBunch49 @kylegriffin1 I used to think so, but if you look at Congress we really dont have that man old times in the House - and the ones we do are beloved by constituents. 		I think we need to repeal the amendment that provided direct election of senators. People would participate in local govt
@brianschatz No they arent dude. Quit fear mongering.
@RepRubenGallego Hahaha nobody is doing that dude.  Literally nobody on either side is doing that. You're just trying to scare seniors.
@mj_lee Like Obama went after that child with drones?
@SherriBunch49 @kylegriffin1 That's the frustrating thing ive found about immigration issues. When you get past the emotions and rhetoric, most people agree on 90% of it.
@steven10471 @thehill Are you going to address it or not?  I'm going to mute you if your next reply doesnt.
@SherriBunch49 @kylegriffin1 But they're still illegal, and therefore do not have a voice in our political system.  That said, I'd be okay with finding a way to make them legal because, yes, we definitely need them.

@CillizzaCNN He's right, you know.
@SherriBunch49 @kylegriffin1 I can agree with that. Except they arent suppose to represent "undocumented," as she apparently thinks she should.
@pinkblush99 @La_Lizard @MarthaMcSally @azcentral Literally on a conference call with HHS ORR right now dude.
@La_Lizard @pinkblush99 @MarthaMcSally @azcentral That's a compelling argument. What else?
@SherriBunch49 @kylegriffin1 Hahaha yeah sure. Because politicians often represent people that dont vote for them, right?		Also, what a stupid thing to say when your entire campaign is "muh voter suppression"
@DeSchedule420 @abbydphillip Whataboutism. Fox is trash too.
@JRubinBlogger So are you...
@JRubinBlogger @EliStokols Ironically, I've never heard a mature person refer to adults as "grown-ups"
@abbydphillip Is this what passes for journalism these days?
@ArthurDayne1 Disagree!  SAD!
@kylegriffin1 https://t.co/3WfPt8JMSz		Turnout of whom?
@pinkblush99 @MarthaMcSally @azcentral What about them?  They're processed then reunited with their parents.  Can you suggest a better system?
@ArthurDayne1 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I dont care who wins #AZSen - @MarthaMcSally is a liberal Republican, @kyrstensinema is a conservative Democrat - their politics arent that different, and I know they both mean well. Theyre also both very pretty and single and they should absolutely DM me their number ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
#MSM "journalists":		&gt;[Thing] happened.		&gt;@realDonaldTrump enabled this.		&gt;Why hasnt Trump done something about [hing]?		&gt;OMG I cant believe Trump responded to [thing]!		&gt;Trump clearly doesnt know about [thing].		&gt;Why was Trump so hasty dealing with [thing]?		&gt;clearly hes a nazi!
@pinkblush99 @MarthaMcSally @azcentral This is a fake issue.  Separating the children from the "parents" is standard procedure in any arrest. At the border, it turns out that up to 1/3 of them arent actually their parents and they're being trafficked.		Why do you support selling children into slavery? #SexTrafficking
@MarthaMcSally @azcentral To be fair I've heard McSally laugh at the idea of a wall, call it "stupid" and "unserious," and make fun of Trump for proposing it, saying he is pandering to stupid voters.

Hey @thehill would you be willing to sign a sworn statement that says you dont pay for twitter followers and none of your commenters are your own employees?  I dont see why you wouldnt...
Given my interactions with commenters on @thehill tweets, I'm convinced they're all either their employees or fake accounts.  They're always the same "omg I'm outraged reee" and they never respond to me aside from rare instances. 		#FAKENEWS
@StephenHotHands @thehill He wasn't letting her close the door. Did you even watch the video?
@NateSilver538 Lol- "journalists"
@StephenHotHands @thehill What are you even talking about?  If he lived there just use the keypad.  Instead he was trying to push past her, which from what I can see, bordered on assault.		Are you really this stupid? Or are you just doingental gymnastics because you WANT to be outraged?
@StephenHotHands @thehill Okay, then why didnt he just let her close the door, and use the keypad like every resident...		Seriously, this is common practice. You're not supposed to let anyone past the front door unless you absolutely know they live there. Have you never lived in an apartment building?
@StephenHotHands @thehill And she didnt have to let him in.  There's a keypad, use it.

@jokarr33 @raidersrant @thehill Looks like you're right. I guess we would know that if @thehill reported crucial facts instead of lazily posting half-asked clickbait.
@steven10471 @thehill You want to actually address what I wrote or just be a child?
@HuffPost You'd say it was sexist if he did the oppose. 		Spare me the hand-wringing, commies.
@jrmduc @thehill This has nothing to do with race. You're not supposed to let people into buildings like that as its bypassing security.
@cannon29 @thehill Why didnt he use the keypad?
@catcatdean @thehill Ever lived in a large building?  You're not supposed to let people in.
@cannon29 @swallace101 @thehill Patiently waiting for those Facebook likes because this is faux outrage
@thehill Also, noticed you didnt probide a direct link to a video. Is that maybe because if you go to the trouble of going to his Facebook page, the video shows you're blatantly lying?  Do you guys feel shame?
This is infuriating because @thehill runs race-baiting stories like this all the time and they purposely leave out crucial details. What a horrible, untrustworthy, garbage company. I would be embarrassed to tell anyone I worked for them. Disgusting. 		#FAKENEWS
Watch the actual video. This woman should not be fired - she asks him to use the keypad.		Anyone that's lived in a large building will tell you, you dont open the door for anyone you dont know lives there. Ironically, she was fired for doing her job. Why didnt he use the keypad? https://t.co/vqT0ftwC6Q
@raidersrant @thehill Yeah but that doesnt get him his precious attention or get the hill their precious clicks.
@swallace101 @thehill Actually, when you live in a large building you are absolutely NOT supposed to let anyone in.  There was a keypad, and she was just asking h to m to use it to prove he was a resident.  It's very likely something along these lines is in their lease.
@StephenHotHands @thehill I wouldn't have let anyone in, black, white, or otherwise. 		Why didnt he use the keypad if he was a tenant?  He could have deescalated all of this. But then he wouldn't have gotten his precious attention.
@tango793_anne @thehill Why didnt he just put his code in then?  Unless he wanted to put a video on social media to get attention...
@thehill #fakenews #racebaiting		Everyone knows you dont let anyone in if there is a card reader or keypad.  Why didnt he just let her shut the door and put in his code?  This is victimhood seeking at its finest and I would have done exactly the same thing.
This is an easy one - she doesnt care if she tanks the midterms. She only cares about herself. @SenWarren is the worst kind of swamp creature. https://t.co/eOSVjtLWpl

@HuffPost JFC stop.  1) Being fat is NOT healthy. 2) Can you take just a 10 minute break from the gay stuff?  I don't care about other peoples preferences and its unhealthy to talk about it this much.
@voxdotcom ITS. THE. LAW.

Hey @Disney and @Marvel -thank you for canning this guy.  I'd say the same if he was a toxic conservative. Marvel/Star Wars are about GOOD STORIES, not partisan politics.  Glad you see that turning off half your audience isn't a good idea. https://t.co/Iwoo3n08zJ

@sdewitt70 Muted. Too stupid to answer a direct question.

My favorite "comebacks" from morons on twitter is when they insult me for being a cat.		Do you actually think I'm a cat?  I refuse to believe anyone is that stupid.

@RepMikeQuigley Did that turn out to be a hoax?

And he will still lose.  Thanks for helping divert this money away from competitive races @BetoORourke 😂😂😂 https://t.co/ju1hkcvjhP
@Iddybud @Firedup2020 @JohnJHarwood Pretty sure they won because the Democrats ignored the middle of the country for decades.  What are you even talking about?
@SusanSommers72 @JohnJHarwood @bemuir_ronkon79 You mean Scalise.  Scalia is dead.		And a leftist shot at him while shouting about healthcare.  Rand Paul was tackled in his front yard. Multiple Democrats have quite literally called for violence. What planet are you on?
@leonceg @JohnJHarwood @DavidCornDC When has anyone ever said that.  What a lazy strawman.
@mayerander @HowardLapin @JohnJHarwood I was told by the left that words are violence. Make up your minds.
@Firedup2020 @Iddybud @JohnJHarwood Um. Did you miss where they won last cycle?
@BronxGirl1357 @JohnJHarwood @SteveScalise There are many examples of them encouraging violence
@JohnJHarwood &gt;which is not true		Everything up to this point was reporting. Your editorialization is unnecessary. 		Also, it is absolutely true. You know the guy at the baseball field shouted "this is for healthcare!" As he opened fire, and you didn't report it.  None of you clowns did.
I would like an answer on this @jack - it seems that pointing to the tweet in question would help your cause and the only reason you wouldn't want to specify is that increased transparency would show your bias against conservatives. What do you have to hide @TwitterSupport ? https://t.co/KCrQFwljxM
@saavyhomebuyer @RepSpeier @POTUS Nah. Other states shouldn't have to subsidize CA's nonsense.
@jharrison2560 @RepSpeier @POTUS You realize gerrymandering affects House districts and has absolutely nothing to do with the electoral college, right?  Surely this was a joke?
@voxdotcom you only care about him because he's a fellow commie.  He's really not even that good.
@thehill LOL for doing what?

@MollieKatzen @kylegriffin1 Does that hotline tell voters how to register properly with their current address?  Because that's why these are pending. It's their fault.
@ggforbes @thehill 1) Yes I would, even if I disagreed with the law. It's called being an adult and knowing what the rules of the game are.  		2) Oooh demographics are changing? How scary!  Pretty racist to think they'll all automatically agree with you.
@ggforbes @thehill None of what you wrote means anything.  The executive branch enforces the laws the legislature passes and doesn't get to choose.  If you don't like the law, the people should replace the legislators and repeal it.  Until then its just partisan whining.
@NewYorker Then why were we just listening to 36 year old allegations?
@TDBank_US OMG stop constantly pandering.  like 96% of your customers aren't gay and don't care.
@thehill I was pretty sure she died like 4 years ago...
@RepEliotEngel &gt;hours-long downtimes		Oh man, the horror!  This is the most pathetic faux outrage to date.
@ggforbes @thehill Also, regardless of what you think of the law, it is the law.  The executive branch doesn't get to choose which they enforce, so putting this on Kemp is simply unfair and misleading.
@ggforbes @thehill Or maybe registering with your correct information is a really low bar and completely reasonable to ask.		So what's today's "oppression?"  You have to go online and update your address when you move?  How absolutely horrifying!
@mcevasco @tedlieu hahaha Ted Lieu is a smug moron.
@TheEconomist Don't descend into this, please.  The Economist was one of the last places to find real analysis and not garbage like this.
@Slate Literally every investigation is.  But you know that, you're just lying.
@ForecasterEnten Nate Silver hasn't predicted anything right since 2012, which I'm sure was a fluke.
@kylegriffin1 Good.  #MeToo is a toxic movement that hurts real victims by equating rape with saying something off-color.
@thehill So @BrianKempGA is just following the law, and @thehill is just garbage, click-bait propaganda.  Don't give them clicks.
@thehill The Hill is lying again: "the applications are being held due to the state's "exact match" law, which passed last year. The law requires an applicant's information to match exactly what is listed by the state's Department of Driver Services or the Social Security Administration."

@oymo1 @jaykeobe @brteacher @NateSilver538 Wow - I never knew I could win things that don't exist!
@KatieMHRoberts @stephenrhymer @NateSilver538 Lol yeah because that's what everyone was missing - more direct mail pieces 😂😂😂		I shouldn't make fun because youre trying and obviously mean well. Maybe volunteer for your local party office or something.
@thehill @AprilDRyan is toxic, injecting race into everything.
@JohnJHarwood Who is DeShaun Watson?  Is he a lie?  Because then this tweet makes sense.
@kylegriffin1 This is not interesting at all.
@kylegriffin1 hahaha no it can't. Now you're just making stuff up.		Technically Congress can hold the Attorney General in contempt and subpoena him, too, but who will enforce it?
@NateSilver538 Its amazing how out of touch you are these days.		The boost isn't coming from a victory.  It's coming from the moral indignation caused by slandering a widely-respected judge. It's coming from the fact that the left crossed a new line and people are pissed.
@AriRabinHavt You are an absolute clown if you think this means anything.
@KatieMHRoberts @stephenrhymer @NateSilver538 haha you write postcards?  To members?  Seriously that does nothing but cause an intern more work.
@MercedHome4U @ktumulty its sexist against women.  assuming they can only have one point of view.  Plenty of women that were on the other side of this and don't pretend otherwise.
Watching @KamalaHarris and @CoryBooker desperately virtue signal to become the 2020 front-runner is really entertaining.  Not a single independent will vote for either.  Hopefully we don't get so many crazies that they split the crazy vote and nominate a moderate 😅
@davigoli @Scorched_Deer @SuperSteveDV @mattyglesias Wait - you mean words don't actually hurt people?  Weird - tell that to the rest of the liberals.
@HRSA_4 @mattyglesias Because you equated it with being "anti-democracy" - which is clearly perjorative.		And yes, I think it's better than popular vote.  The president represents the states as well as the people.  Hence why the Senate and House are structured differently.
@KatieMHRoberts @stephenrhymer @NateSilver538 Really?  what's their strategy then?  What's their message?  what demographics and regions are they targeting?
@jaykeobe @brteacher @NateSilver538 Hey look - I found the guy in the thread that knows nothing about campaign finance but feels the need to make a smug comment anyway because of his ignorant partisanship. What do I win?
Look at how out of touch Nate Silver is these days. Sad, he used to actually do analysis. Now he's a hack spewing propaganda from his ivory tower. https://t.co/A5N8NEcwKW
@NateSilver538 Haha you really think Feinstein would spend time outside of CA, or even make a difference if she did?
@newyorkerlive @NewYorker @AmbassadorRice Hyperbole
@HRSA_4 @mattyglesias We don't have a democracy.  We have a representative, bicameral republic.  Don't like it? Change the constitution.  Until then you're just a sore loser throwing mud at your opponents with cliches like "anti-democracy."  What a pathetic attempt at establishing a false high ground.
I don't understand the #TimesUp hashtag.  Who's time is up? Is it a threat?
@RoKhanna No they don't stop lying.
Because so many people were willing to go along with the #Kavanaugh #SmearCampaign, I now believe that false rape accusations are much more common than I previously thought.  Congrats #Democrats - you have done significant and long-term harm to the #MeToo movement.
@RepSpeier @POTUS @senatemajldr Probably shouldn't tweet this from your official account.
@Chaco_Chicken @nycsouthpaw know-nothing*
@Chaco_Chicken @nycsouthpaw Again - what the hell does this have to do with China investigating the president of Interpol?
@Chaco_Chicken @nycsouthpaw Every justice has a side.  Are you going to sit here an pretend that everyone sitting on that court doesnt align with the party they were nominated by?
@davigoli @Scorched_Deer @SuperSteveDV @mattyglesias Go outside.
What is this even? https://t.co/WarZlDMACw

@Chaco_Chicken @nycsouthpaw wtf does kavanaugh have to do with this?  Have you completely lost it?
@APDiploWriter Maybe this is a fragile process and he doesn't want clowns like you shouting questions at KJU?
@davigoli @mattyglesias The more time I spend on here the more I'm convinced it's mostly populated by 12 year olds.		JFC dude can you do any better than that?
@NRO https://t.co/zI5gZxqwD4
@davigoli @mattyglesias Looks like someone didn't pay attention in high school civics class...
@mattyglesias Don't be a sore loser.  The popular vote was never supposed to matter.
@NateSilver538 I honestly believe you have no idea what you're talking about anymore.
@Steven_Patz @howroute @kylegriffin1 If you're calling for impeachment, you should have a specific crime to point to.  Otherwise you just look like an idiot.
@MSNBC It's never good enough for the race-baiter in chief.
@howroute @kylegriffin1 What has he done - specifically - that is a crime worthy of impeachment?
@kylegriffin1 I like how the left thinks this is a big deal but @BarackObama weaponizing the IRS isn't.
@Sammyjkramer @JohnJHarwood Muted
@Sammyjkramer @JohnJHarwood you replied to me, moron.
@Sammyjkramer @JohnJHarwood But see you're saying I'm wrong but not why I'm wrong.  That's how a child argues.  Address the point or go away.
@MSNBC Seriously, you guys look pathetic and everyone is tired of it.  Haven't you thought about throwing an actual news story in there once in a while?  Just a little to not look completely like hacks?
@MSNBC WELL FOLKS - I guess the #MSM is done slandering #Kavanaugh.  It's time to go back to obsessing about porn stars and russia conspiracy theories.
@kylegriffin1 Harassed =/= rape		While neither is acceptable, one is much worse dude.  Stop with the false equivalency.
@Sammyjkramer @JohnJHarwood I guarantee you many of them are paid, but I never said Soros.  Nice strawman though.  I wouldn't want you to have to actually address the argument - that would be too difficult for you.		@JohnJHarwood lied.  Address that.  Are you saying he didn't?
@ArielDumas Nobody cares about your feelings.  Politics is a place for logic, not the whims of your hormones.

@Moira23299435 @RepSpeier Thank you.  And survivors are encouraged to report sexual assault IMMEDIATELY so police can gather as much evidence as possible and convict the SOB.  Why does this even need to be explained?
@Calvinchapman10 @RepSpeier dont forget the holocaust, black plague, and multiple brutal dictatorships.
@DameJEMarshall @RepSpeier @SenatorCollins @FBI @WhiteHouse So you really just don't believe that anyone has ever lied about a crime?
TFW @RepSpeier likens a SCOTUS confirmation to the holocaust, slavery, and the black plague. 		#LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder https://t.co/6wZcRjDUa4
@RepSpeier Are you actually serious?  Are you saying the #KavanaughConfirmation is on par with the holocaust, slavery, and violent dictatorships?		#LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder #TrumpDerangementSyndrome 		@realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller @TuckerCarlson do you guys see this?
@MercedHome4U @ktumulty That's a pretty sexist thing to say.  so women are only allowed to be liberals?		Also the point of the original tweet was faux outrage at grassley saying maybe people didn't want to work for the committee. So, which is it?
Finally... https://t.co/G01DIO6V52
@threetails what a stupid comparison
I just want to emphasize that this was the ENTIRETY of the protesters here for #Kavanaugh - so regardless of all the different videos you've seen, it was the same 100 or so paid protesters in every incident. https://t.co/gkSki9LovC

@Castantine @mariedangelo22 @ktumulty The only person that gives a shit about the gender of a justice or a representative is a sexist.  Men can do just as good of a job as a woman and vice versa.  Project much?
What she is saying is absolutely nonsensical and its disgusting that special interest groups like @womensmarch @Everytown and @PPFA are all using people like this that are clearly emotionally broken as pawns in their sick game.

@TCU His views didn't adversely affect anyone.  Words can't hurt people - stop coddling students like this.  You all look pathetic.
@rlnave Because if they did, that's all the #MSM would talk about.
@RepLaHood So...you want to raise taxes?  Aren't you a republican?
@JamesPindell But she ran as a republican, which is what voters sent to washington.  There is rarely any controversy within the party on nominees.  Voting against Kavanaugh would be a betrayal of her constituency.
@thehill Why do they think this will do anything but make them look stupid?
@thehill He is a clown
@JamesPindell This is an easy decision.  She is a republican.  She should act like one and respect those that voted for her.
@NBCNews Said the woman that should be in jail and is married to a rapist...
@DevilsC34662767 @CChristineFair That doesn't surprise me.  That woman needs some kind of medication.
@voxdotcom No, you're unlikable and unserious when you try to destroy someone with false accusations.  Stop purposely missing the point.
@SenGillibrand You have proven that you are too hysterical to be a US senator.  You have also proven with your shameful actions that your conduct is not fitting of a senator.
@Alyssa_Milano Okay, now I don't believe anything you say.  This is clearly a bunch of publicity stunts because you're tired of being a washed-up has-been.  Your attention seeking is more than transparent. #GoAway

@Amoral_Drumpf @thehill Read the article.  You may want to delete this tweet.  This is literally the exact same policy as heterosexual couples.

@ATL_Mark34 @thehill No it isn't.  It's literally the exact same policy for straight couples
@JMollico @thehill you mean they're subject to the exact same rules as heterosexual couples?  How oppressive!		Try reading the article next time.
@Drakedabs @thehill it's literally the same policy for heterosexual partners too. Read the article before feigning outrage.  It's literally the 2nd paragraph.

@TangNoire @PSheppardTV Its absolutely not rare, and Ive seen that from experience.
@TangNoire @PSheppardTV Even if there is no statute of limitations, you should report immediately. You have a civic duty - every moment you wait, you increase the chance that they will get away with it, or even rape someone else.  I know its hard, but its the right thing to do.
@TangNoire @PSheppardTV And please - when you know of an assault tell the police immediately.  The sooner you do, the better the chance they have of convicting them.
@TangNoire @PSheppardTV If you have evidence, please go ahead and make their life hell. Rapists belong in prison. Everyone agrees with that except rapists. The problem is baseless accusations.
@TangNoire @PSheppardTV Yes, she is a liar.  Her specifically, and that doesnt extend to anyone else. Ford is clearly being used as a political pawn. 		Know who the real "rape enablers" are? People that know a rape happened but dont report them. Rapists need to be in jail, no matter how hard that is.
@Slate Stop spamming them, then
@mattyglesias No it fucking doesnt
@TangNoire @PSheppardTV Nobody attacked her at all. Stop making shit up.

This.  All of this. https://t.co/YVZ4BTw4Kx
Hey @RepMaloney - I saw you crying during the #Kavanaugh hearing.  I know you're probably a good person, deep down.  You know this is wrong.  You know this is not how we should conduct our affairs as a civilized nation.  You were there.  Speak up.  Its time to end this charade.
Re-watching this hearing &amp; I can't believe this testimony.  Anyone that watches this &amp; doesn't understand this is a #SmearCampaign is just blindly partisan or stupid.  Brett #Kavanaugh appears to be a good man, and what #Democrats are doing to him &amp; his family is disgusting.
@RepKarenBass He said he was preparing for his testimony.  Which is entirely reasonable.  But that gets in the way of you being a hack, doesn't it.

@JohnGlosson @CHueyBurns but absent evidence, its pretty fucked up to accuse someone of that.  Seriously man what is wrong with liberals right now?  They've let their rage lead them to adopt a position where the oppose due process of law.
@thehill @repjoecrowley *illegal immigrants
@SenSchumer This was your goal all along.  Delay until after the elections, then if you win the House or more seats in the Senate, you can demand delay until the new Congress.  Funny how none of the "journalists" have mentioned that this is the last week in session before November.
@cyncynj @thehill @GOP I dont think she knows what she means...
