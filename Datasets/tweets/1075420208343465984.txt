@RudyHavenstein NFL firsts first time for everything salary cap and unlimited black card go a lonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnng.ways
@RudyHavenstein @DaveyTrep @imf 70Ã—5 =350cash projected at 500 return =2500 leaves 2150 profit		70 Ã—10 =700cash projected est..400return =4000$$leaves 3300$$profit.. which means you generate a higher profit margin by deflating the value because the consumer can afford to save an average of 4k yrly
@RudyHavenstein @DaveyTrep @imf Example...we both pay 70 dollars per item you retail at 500 for max I retail at 399.00 u sell 5 items to loyal customer 2500.due to economy wages I sell 10 and make 4grand. Figure....70 for 5 is 35...4k profit...10 items at 399 I make 4kprofit..
@RudyHavenstein @DaveyTrep @imf Dillie dillie the deflation of currency is key to inflation per the economy based on profit to zero methods.With our great import/export commerce were able to build quality products as 70 in tv for only 70 bucks est...?? Instead of hedgehogging and retailing our products for max

@realDonaldTrump I proposed a Triangle Government support system I would everyone to view on my following page.. I just want thoughts it's time we move forward and I feel this is the only way  our government would be a Fair system based on our creed of race religion sex or creed
@realDonaldTrump If we focus on making America the land it was designed to be we could be so much further ahead as a nation.5.7 billion dollars has created a massacre amongst the government when if we focus on greatness legalizing marijuana in America would generate 100 bill.. 5.7 wall 95 leftujs
@realDonaldTrump Mr.President Trump We need a Triangle Government support system in America it's time up grade our government into the 21st century

@realDonaldTrump Mr.Trump we really hot to look at Government reform it's America separate republicans live by our on values and allow democrats to live by they on values I propose triangle government system in America we must have it in order for everyone to win.
@realDonaldTrump Mr.Trump shut dat mf down until we get some understanding should add in lowering payroll taxes for the middle class to 12 percent...

@realDonaldTrump Mr.President Trump We need a Triangle Government support system in America so everyone can be accountable for their own actions.we shall not segregate but we must separate and allow the American people to live under laws that best fit what they want out of life
Mr.Trump shut dat mf down.....i been waiting on a President with some nuts...lbvs..... https://t.co/Z4wFoXzQbK

Triangle Government support system in America please support it's the only thing fair to each American regardless of race religion sex or creed it allows everyone to live by the values they believe without conflict it's a great resolution Triangle Government support system.... https://t.co/DhnHStBrfK
It's time for Triangle Government support system in America it allows republicans to support Americans who believe in republicans values and allow democrats to support Americans who believe in democracy thus is only hope America has as moving forward to be the greatest nation.. https://t.co/DhnHStBrfK
Mr.o Reilly right now with the government we have it's republicans saying fuck democrats and democrats saying fuck republicans which clearly shows they are not ever gonna get along..unfair to America it's time to bring our government system in America to the 21st century https://t.co/DhnHStT27i

@maziehirono @AFLCIO Mrs.chorino if you support the Triangle Government support system I proposed you want ever have to deal with anyone like Trump again..guaranteed the Government want ever shutdown again
@KamalaHarris Mrs.kamala Harris generous point there fleeing harm only to harm us why are they fleeing their country from harm and trying to force their beliefs on us when they are running from there own beliefs I think it proves Our God's word is true when he said the devil is allah...
@AOC Honestly if it would have been Mr.Trump or any man in general reflecting a nude photo to a woman he would have been arrested and charged for some type of sex crime but since it's a woman it's ok it is but judicially it's not...you can't fight for equality and not accept it...
Triangle Government support system...should be adopted in America....
Honestly we need to reform our government because our current outdated government system is destroying American people and American values..lets trango America..Triangle government support system....Americas yellow brick road..
@jmeacham Mrs.meacham this is a great point of view but can you also show a picture of who formed the klan and why they were formed
@amyklobuchar @MichaelBennet Y all make sure y'all tweet me what time we leaving lol... when we get to the moon y'all can drop me off at cousin nem house
@IlhanMN I think the main message here is America is not the place to seek asylum with all due respect to you guys higher power America was built on Christian principles given by Lord Jesus Christ so if you are running to America to escape asylum it seems strange.
@BillOReilly Mr.Oreilly I think its time for a triangle government system in America no one should have to suffer for some one else's mistakes regardless of what party you support.
@RepPressley @IlhanMN @SEIU @32BJSEIU If America adopts the Triangle Government support system I proposed as a citizen of The United States there wouldn't be any government shut down for the remaining of democracy that's one great benefit of the support system I proposed
This is the only way I see America moving forward and standing as one nation.With the Triangle Government support system there's no more fighting and bashing each other with Americans hard earned money and should bring clarity to a lot of grey areas in which America is being lost
What ever visions put in place by your chosen party will be the vision you live by as a citizen of The United States.Example..Republicans vote retirement age 55..Democracy votes retirement age 72..whichever party you registered as will be the age you able to retire with benefits
33%to both parties the house and Senate to address the needs and values of the American people they serve.1%should be in a reserved fund in case any party needs to borrow money from the funds which would require a signature from the President and also the opposing party.
FUNDING...for the Triangle Government support system will be solemnly based on the President projection for each party.However what the The federal budget is shall be triangular separated 33%To President to address all foreign affairs and make sure our needs are met.and also 33%
Can only have second term if reelected by majority vote of his people as the leader or chairman after the opposite successor has served his term..
The next house leader or senate chairman should automatically take control of The President position.If a Republican is voted as first President of The Triangle Government support system the Senate chairman shall automatically replace him and vice versa.The President of America
The significant process about the Triangle Government support system is that there should be an election held to consider The President of America also the house leader and senate chairman.The process of the Triangle takes place at the end of the President term of 4 yrs.
Have final say by the house leader.the same thing applies to the senate for the American democrats.the President shall sign any Bill into law that has been presented by both parties without the option to veto.
Americans register as Democrat.with this active Republic America no longer has to live under democratic laws and values and also Democracy doesn't have to live by Republican values.Whichever laws created by the house on behalf of the American people for Republican values shall
The legislative system shall be separated into two systems which is the house and the senate if not renamed by majority vote.The house shall create all suitable values of life for all Americans register as Republican.The senate Shall create all suitable values of life for all of
The Triangle Government will allow every citizen of the United States to register as Republican or Democratic..The Triangle will be led by the Head of the United States Which is the President.The President shall have 100%control of foreign affairs.
I Terry Barnell Christon would like to present to the American people The first of kind Triangle Government support system..The purpose of this system is to establish the laws and values of the American people in which every member of Congress swears to do..
I think its time to separate but not segregate America.Martin Luther king had a dream but Personally I have a vision that True American values can be lived without government control.Those in need of Government support shall have the right to do so but only at Government expense
Honestly I think the game of tag is kinda old.I think the American people is getting to old to continue living and not being able to live their life of choice before passing https://t.co/tEK7qfhTey Mr.President Trump and all members of Congress and the legislative system I think
Our government is living in the same mind frame that has kept America segregated from the beginning of times..we have only had a see saw government for the past 39 yrs that I know since I been a new born..we go forward only to change laws and go back only to play tag your it...
As a fully fledged Republican I fully respect the government system in America but I feel certain issues the American people should be able to make their own decisions without force or penalty.Honestly our government is living in the same mind frame that has kept America segregat
However to some that might be overwhelming to live with such great responsibility but to those who accept the challenge should have the opportunity to do so without having fear of building a lose lose success due to government taxes and regulations.
Our government is exploding but we're fighting each other to protect laws and values of non Americans to where it's causing the true values of America to be destroyed.America was built so we could be free from Government slavery live wealthy and enjoy the greatest resources..
To Mr President Trump  all senators and congressmen ist time we focus on bringing our government to the 21st century we are living off old belittled values from both parties of political system and it's destroying American people. Our government is exploding but we're fighting us
@realDonaldTrump Mr.President personally I think should make the meeting very sooner than later and look him in eyes and let him know he's a great man then on to other issues...#great job #triangle government
@GovMarkDayton Governor Dayton as fully fledged Republican and a resident of Minnesota and you being a Democrat governor honestly Mr.Dayton you have done a great dam job with the state of Minnesota I really got a chance to see the tax dollars be used in democratic fashion that served a purpose.
@amyklobuchar Mrs klobuchar I agree they fucking wit dat pay pay but honestly as a Republican and Trump supporter I think the real reason Mr.President is standing firm is because we were belittled by the Obama administration when it came to Obama care and the keystones pipes Obama lied..
It's funny how people say the Trump wall is ineffective but then say we need a climate control bill I ain't da smartest mf in da world but I know you gotta better chance with a wall then you have at controlling mother nature....ujs....dats duuuhhhh...doink yo head crazy.
@KamalaHarris Mrs.kamala as the President of America ist there to provide for America not just the middle class I hope you don't win if you run if you do run I hope keep running pass the white house that's why America is separated as of now
I think people on welfare and government assistance and receiving child support should be drug tested on random basis in order to receive benefits due to the abuse of the system and the taxpayers are being accountable and we don't even do drugs or alcohol..
It hurts me as an American citizen that our government spend more money to help other countries when we're being financially slaved on our own great country of America...lets make America great again
Mn man Keith Ellison blocked me I guess my views were right who next...lets go trump
I see he wasn't man enough to take it no fun when the rabbit got the gun you don't deserve to be a politician coward if you can throw a rock show ya hand
@HillaryClinton I think its time for a triangle government system in America Mrs. Hiliary if present this system you might have more support follow my page to learn more
@HillaryClinton Mrs.clinton I fully agree but can you explain how is empowering Isis and I ran is dangerous when you supported Obama I billion dollars in cash to the country and said it was for a good cause can you explain the good cause
@nlincoln7 @RepJoeKennedy We don't want the wall but we gotta support our leader but we feel there are more serious issues to address than the wall but until the leader is satisfied this is what it is
@clsimpson101 @RepJoeKennedy @GOP If democrats care why they formed the kkk to kill all blacks and republicans so blacks could stay in slavery why y'all didn't vote to end slavery why y'all tax us and take our hard earned money then won't give us free sandwich when you built restaurant with our money but you care
@lister_lester @RepJoeKennedy @YMLinMaryland See this how the democrats belittle American people if I make a thousand dollars a week and you make a hundred if taxes 20 percent I save 200 dollars but you only save 20..of you got a million you save 200thousand it's not for the rich it just they are rich but every one wins
@DjRobApollo @RepJoeKennedy My question is Obama 8trllion on go green and the world still red white and blue so where da money..now dats a green pocket
@CarbonTaxSTAT @RepJoeKennedy Well they need to be some propping mfs then because Obama got errbody legs at his house that's why he built a wall #aroundhishouse
@donalynette @RepJoeKennedy @StormResist I fully support Trump but da wall I think can be handle in other ways but if he can build it without charging America for it let's build
@LucienTodd @PeterEsquire @kdog222 @RepJoeKennedy Shiddddddd yes we were
@PatThompa @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @JesseBWatters You a damn lie he did
@keithellison a white lady said he tainted her jello 30yrs ago.and you turn yo back on him..at the same time a white woman confesses to having enmitt till killed and she gets ok don't worry bout it and you and your democracy niggas did a mf thang but you let Bill get slaughtered
@keithellison Mr.Ellison with all due respect dis is why we say mf niggas like you..You talk all dis bullshit about blacks rights and justice and see niggas like you supporting Mfs like your democracy that will lock a successful black mentor as Mr. Cosby in prison because
@Z3n1a @keithellison Man Bernie crazy den a mf he gone raise taxes to 52 percent...lol...shiddd
@00X00X001 @efonekpo @keithellison Whatever you said I agree lol..
@keithellison Mr.Ellison c'mon man we gotta keep this shut real yo paycheck 30k you telling me you support a man that's gone take 15 of that 30shiddddd....i ain't da smartest mf in da world but I know dat ain't right
@keithellison Mr.Ellison i was born and raised in Mississippi and I can tell ya dem Mfs retarded standing on dat stage no offense but if a mf holding a sign saying he fighting for workers right and he supporting a mf that's telling him imma take half yo paycheck every week I ain't dasmartis mf
And also those register Republican shall live by the laws and codes designed by the house.This triangle government will ensure America grows at the fastest rate possible because everyone will get the chance to live by their beliefs and we don't have any one to blame triangle draf
The house speaker shall sign all laws into place on behalf of the republic and the senate chairman shall sign laws in place by the democracy.Each chamber shall make laws or codes for the party only in which those register as democracy shall live by the codes created by their part
The catch is to have all Americans register as Republican or Democrat.The house who controls the budget for republic shall set rights an d laws an d tax policies for the Republican an d the senate represent shall set laws an d govern for the American democracy.the house speaker.
In which the President shall have sole power over his budget an d the military.The remaining 66% shall be evenly distributed between the two parties in which the house shall represent the American Republican an d the senate represent the American democracy..
President of American and all members of Congress i think we really need to look at having a triangle government system in America.. with the triangle government system the American federal budget shall be divided into three parts 34%for President to address all foreign affairs
I don't think its fair for citizens to be forced to live by democracy when they fully believe in republicans values and also I don't think its fare for democracy to live by Republican values when they have full need of Government support with that being said in respect to the
Their are others who feels as if the Republican way of life may be to overwhelming and due to that it has corrupted our government an has America fight against one another instead of standing in unity. Honestly I don't think its fair to me to be forced live by democracy when
The fight between the two parties is causing corruption amongst the American people. In America which was created an d designed to be the land of the free an d home of th brave as a man who views Republican values as his way of life their are others who feels as if the republican
Under American law and government we are divided  two main sections republicans and democrats the fight bet
So that the as American people could live free without government destroying their life like in other countries..With that being said I have a solution I would like to present to help upgrade the standards of our government system...
When it comes to our government system we still have the same handcuffs and shackles that was put I'm place centuries ago. Mr.Trump and all Congress in the way America was designed we have to acknowledge that republicans was designed to protect the people's rights of life
To Mr. President and all Congress as an American citizen I really think we have to take this time to reform our government system and bring it into the 20th century...we got flying cars self driving cars Alexa would even order us a pizza.zBut when it comes to our government
Our kids are suffering because some lower house holds are unbalanced due to the rising cost of taxes and commodities..in an all fair world nothing would be perfect but in today's world I think we can all agree that our system is broken and is being proven as unaffective to all
Trying to defeat the counterpart is what's has been destroying American since the beginning of time right now our system is broken our leaders our fighting each other without compromising putting their careers and repretation before the true needs of American people our kids are
America to President @realDonaldTrump  and each level of Congress we need to need to really hear this this the last day of 2018 and from what I am seeing everyone is headed into the new legislative session with the wrong intentions.everyones goal is defeat their counterpart but

@amyklobuchar Mrs.Amy klobuchar I fully respect you addressing issues of sexual harassment but I think self defense is more important than sexual harassment it's not fair these women fucking like dogs then use the system to destroy the men if they feel the need to then women are not being held

@realDonaldTrump @POTUS @JesseBWatters Tell CNN investigate dat 1.5billion Obama gave away there has to be foul or illegal play because America don't debts dues or trade purchases with cash money not just that amount but what we owe Iran for when we don't have no trade policy with iran...ujs
@maziehirono @realDonaldTrump Obama sent the Iranian government 1.5 billion dollars in cash to cover up whatever his wrongdoings was in which we all know is facts President Trump hasn't did anything but converse on behalf of the American people with no transaction proof because there wasnt any....who da crook

@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Mr.President Trump I fully agree I will speak for you shut dat mf down until they realize it's not about them and  honor that our mission is to do what's best for America not middle higher or lower class but America how can America stand together when democracy keeps us divided
@keithellison Governor Dayton I agree you are a great man but behind the doors you a true Minnesotan should I say....this civil government in Minnesota needs to be addressed not fair to the people at all we're still human..
@keithellison @realDonaldTrump Mr.ellison I have full respect for you as a politician but is it fair for you to promote negative towards the President..what if the President pressed the issue of you powerbombing your wife..hmmm...
@alfranken With the billions of dollars the state of Minnesota making of the vulnerable mental I'll people they can pay for it. Take everything a man got and give him 80 dollars a month to live then tell him he can't function in society#well damn
Mr.Trump I guess you had to teach him how to be a man they taking ownership my understanding of politics is nuts bust to build success not reputations...we need you trump..
@CNNPolitics @RepSwalwell Shiddddd...we got this let's go Trump turn it up a notch there's a thing I like to call Terry talk and I guarantee Mr.Trump Terry talk will put u in office for a second term.#immigranttax first..they love u to death plus 80%more votes #guaranteed
@IlhanMN Mrs.omar if you guys love y'all values so much why do y'all leave your country to come to ours America is based on Christian values so why don't you fight against y'all own government in your country for what y'all want why come to America just curious...
@IlhanMN They don't deserve to be paid until American people are satisfied
My thing is dat Obama shut the government down numerous times and every one agreed with him even though he blamed every one but him and Trump took response for his and he's the bad guy..Mr.Trump ain't no cowards in heaven dats God's word #Greatjob throw the key away if you ask me
Um just starting to follow politics and it amazes me that a Democrat can commit a crime and no on mentions anything about but if a republicans committed a crime it's considers them the bad guys
@realDonaldTrump Mr.Trump I love you #Greatjob as president and don't get distracted by the negative feedback from the obamanites because even GOD only found one righteous so there's no way you'll find two. ....#trumpsters
Mr kaepernick when you was scoring touchdowns kissing ya arms da man I didn't see you show no support for this issue but when your play level decreased your benefits did also and now you faulting that society is racist against you but you knew this from the very first game ????
Mr.colin kaepernick you have destroyed a wonderful sport that really means a lot to most people. I fully respect your views but my reason for no support is because in your first couple years in da league you shined hard and received lots of money from the endorsements
Real talk to all you entertainers against performing for the super bowl FUCK YALL....I meant dat...Kapernick fuck you...i want ever buy another pair nikes and I got nothing but love but it's something that bothers me????
@realDonaldTrump We need them votes for second election
@realDonaldTrump Mr.trump my view is that if we support the immigrants and put a stable process in place for them to become legal in America like daddy always said somethings cost a pretty penny in which you might have to pay for immigrant tax for 45%which covers billions for rebuilding America?
@realDonaldTrump Mr.Trump we need you in office for a second term so let's make America great like we promised 5billion towards lowering taxes for home owners investing in new ideas and helping build grassroots for the small businesses millions towards lowering college tuition and adult education
@realDonaldTrump Honorable Mr.president Donald Trump I love you like my real dad I fully support your views I am 100 percent solid Republican but please don't let this wall destroy our blessings for you being in office fuck dat wall I agree with you but if you remove 20k back a day you got 30k bk
@GovMarkDayton To @GovMarkDayton you did a wonderful job as governor in Minnesota I fully believe in republicans values but you gave the true meaning of a real Democrat as far as rebuilding this state but it's something that still bothers me
@CBSNews @WCCO Paul Ryan I fully respect this message this should be the focus of every politician
Um starting to like Twitter I think politics will be my new career https://t.co/HaZvfNprkL
My question is why should Trump be punished for any involvement if any but Hillary get a clemency to walk free with her emails and her crime was just as bad but you don't mention that https://t.co/HaZvfNprkL
@SenSanders @keithellison Mr.sanders during your debate your goal was to raise taxes to 52 percent so how is taking over half of the people income helping America people compared to Trump plan which added income instead of subtracting
@SenSanders @keithellison Hello I fully respect you guys but my concern is that since Trump tax plan took effect I have noticed a 260 plus dollar increase in my take home pay every week which would be around 3k margin per yr.and you guys are saying that's hurting American how..
I got a question for all black and white people.. If the democrats are for the black people why when Congress presented the ballot to end slavery and give blacks they rights to life from what I read there were zero democrats voted to end slavery can someone please explain that
