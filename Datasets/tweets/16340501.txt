Point being that we all got help, and we have a responsibility to pay it forward. So when I ask you to meet a talented and passionate kid, and you can't get back to me, it doesn't make me wonder if he or she can do the job. It makes me wonder if you're great at yours. Thanks.
Matt read my work and invited me in. Then he decided to give me a weeklong tryout, and I made the front page. He and the great @WalterVRobinson hired me to work the night shift, where I learned a hundred things a day. I've always tried to reward their faith.
It so happened that a loyal college professor had his kid in the same preschool as @MattStorin, editor of the Boston Globe. At school one day, he said, "I know a guy you should meet." Matt didn't do the hiring. He was crazy busy. He had no slots to fill. He said: OK, why not.
We all have a story about how we got to where we are. I want to super briefly share mine. When I left Columbia J-School almost 25 years ago, I didn't know anyone. I'd never worked at a paper or magazine. Would move anywhere, but not even tiny papers would look at my clips.
This short holiday thread is for industry colleagues. In recent weeks, I took some time to try to help a couple of young journalists who I think are really talented, but found that senior editors are mostly too engulfed by the daily onslaught of news to pay attention. I get that.

That may not be a well reasoned philosophy, but it is a genuine, consistent worldview that informs his dealings with Putin, Xi, Europe and the rest of the world. And you can oppose that worldview on the merits without somehow suggesting that the president is a strategic thinker.
But he does have a kind of barstool take on how the country went to hell - too many immigrants, too much global ambition, too much worrying about freedom in other places and not enough about displaced white Americans. And at least a quarter of the country agrees with him.
I get that argument. But I think we have to distinguish between complex political philosophy, on one hand, and a gut-level, emotional response to our politics on the other. Trump surely doesn't have the former, no argument there.
Interesting reaction to my column today on Trump and Cold War. A lot of readers think it's absurd to suggest that Trump has any actual political worldview, aside from self-absorption. I want to briefly respond. (My first ever thread.)

@Olivianuzzi Story of our times, isn't it...
@Olivianuzzi But that IS to what much of the narrative is reduced. My only point is that we get a little self-obsessed and forget that the intended victims here were political figures, targeted for a kind of mass assassination. They are not an afterthought.
@Borisk It wasn't sent to CNN. It was sent again to a government official the bomber thought he could find at CNN. As I've written many times, Trump's war on the media is reckless -- but not every story is about us. This one is about terrorism aimed at public servants.
@tgspangler Where he thought it would reach a former CIA director. I mean, some of the packages ended up at post offices too, but we‚Äôre not calling it an attack on the USPS.
I‚Äôm confused by the Trump vs. media narrative around these attempted bombings. Near as I can tell, the bomber didn‚Äôt target any media. His CNN device was aimed at a former CIA director. This was terrorism aimed at political critics, not us.

@crampell I believe in a rigged witch hunt the townspeople are allowed to use flamethrowers, rather than torches, and the witch‚Äôs spellbook is confiscated before the chase.
@theblatt That would be nice. And certainly the voters should feel that way. But I don‚Äôt think it changes the fact that a president can fire a cabinet member any time he wants. He‚Äôs the president.
@michaelsokolove That doesn‚Äôt change the right of a president to fire his own AG, if he wants to risk the political consequences. He‚Äôs elected, and it‚Äôs his cabinet.
Of course it would be OK for Trump to fire Sessions ‚Äî the AG works for him. What‚Äôs not OK is whining about the incompetence of an underling you don‚Äôt have the courage to fire and then calling yourself a brilliant CEO.

@FelipeDLH We're a nation of laws. Here we are arguing about the obvious immorality of the law as it's enforced. In 1941 we dispensed with law entirely and wrongly imprisoned tens of thousands of American families. Today does not have to be the worst day ever in order to be very, very bad.
@brianhurn @MontgomeryCoMD Because lower limits means more revenue. That's the incentive problem with outsourcing enforcement at no additional cost in manpower.
@PietroAllar Yes, this is the argument I get. But you know what? Hitler wasn't a drug runner, either, and that doesn't make MS-13 worse than the Nazis. Something can be immoral in different ways without being more egregious. Obviously.

@DanaBashCNN That is a high compliment. When I find that magic dust, I'm sharing.
@MarkLeibovich @nick_field90 The party is rented, not transformed. Plenty of GOP voters and indies who support their president would prefer another given the choice.
@nick_field90 @MarkLeibovich Yeah, I'm not persuaded of that either. Job's not fun. Maybe Ivanka.
@KidKotok @MarkLeibovich But remember: Trump's numbers now in GOP are in opposition to Dems and media. When he ran against all those Repubs, he barely cracked 30.
@KidKotok @MarkLeibovich I think that's the question with which a bunch of people will wrestle -- to run inside or out. Including, perhaps, Trump.
@nick_field90 @MarkLeibovich We've not had a president like this one. It's not right-center. It's personality versus party.
@MarkLeibovich I don't think so, no.
This prez is headed for a serious primary challenge. And math changes when there aren't 10 other candidates scrambling for the same vote.

@AppleSupport Just bought our first Android as a result. Probably not the last.
@AppleSupport you have an obvious keyboard issue that just be known and you refuse to acknowledge it, much less fix it. Inexcusable.
@AppleSupport No. I did this before. You don't help. It's just a way to get people's complaints off Twitter.
@apple are you ever going to fix the iOS glitch that causes me to close out half the time if I want to use a number or a quote mark? Hello?
@KennethBaer @AndreiCherny I refuse to normalize the drinking of Fresca.
@KennethBaer @AndreiCherny whereas you and I know he drinks only Tab.
@KennethBaer @AndreiCherny That is correct. Unless you believe that you have more than enough voters already, no persuasion necessary.
@AndreiCherny the Clinton campaign was essentially ACT. With a candidate sort of attached but not saying very much.
@AndreiCherny ACT, for instance, was a turnout operation. So was OFA. These were not campaigns. They were aspects of a campaign.
@AndreiCherny turnout is the motivating part, not the persuading. But you know that.
@AndreiCherny nope. Also because it turns out you actually have to run a campaign and not just a turnout machine.
@AndreiCherny as I've written many times, I don't think the president's numbers were ever a new normal for Dems. More in this week's column!
But had no issue running for president. OK. https://t.co/vOpZ6nROOv
I hope it's been notarized with one of those little stamp pad doohickeys. https://t.co/q4goFmyoaz
@AndreiCherny Don't feel like this was a failure of turnout.
@ElizabethAngell I've already added it to my "least favorites." Next to "false equivalence."
@Keith_Pol I don't think that's what we're looking at. And I don't know.

Opening Twitter in the morning is like lifting the lid on some magic box of screams and howls. Best to just shut it tight and move on.

Coincidence that Canada has taken out a banner ad on the @NYTimes website, advertising its virtues?
@elfredhanna @peterbakernyt I would not, sorry.
@peterbakernyt I'm not sure that's the headline. Rebel got what is arguably a more influential job, and at least equal.

@KennethBaer Actually I think looking at elections this way is what got you into this mess.
@JeffJarrett23 @jwskss @YahooNews Thank you.
Good God, man. You can't just say things like that on Twitter and expect to get away with it. https://t.co/1GGIjbM8oD
@GChernack Thank you, appreciate your following.
Oh, well. if the commenters aren't happy... https://t.co/zKegaytNCa
@GChernack Can't say that on Twitter. You understand.
@amykoehler Oh yes.
So the lunch aide at my kids' school tells 5th graders that President Obama is a Muslim and doesn't mind cop shootings. Thanks, Trump. @mcps

@DCABLE8062 @YahooNews I appreciate that. No offense taken.
Stupid, maybe, but at least it had punctuation. Also, you can say "ass" on Twitter. https://t.co/iUXK6q4WAZ
@devincomiskey But their elections would not have imperiled democracy, either. If you can't beat the reality TV star, don't wish him on us.
Man is that a good point. https://t.co/aeAo20xQGH
