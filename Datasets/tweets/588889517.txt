My last and probably most vivid memory of 9/11 was my whole family gathered in the living room watching President Bush address the nation that night. It would be years until I finally understood what happened, but that day will always stay with me.
Schools stayed open in California. I don't remember hearing about anything there, but I do remember my teacher. She always walked into the classroom with a  "Hellooooo" and big smile. That day, it was like she had the life sucked out of her.
My mom woke me around 6:30 that day. I will never forget coming downstairs for breakfast and seeing the look on her face as she stood in front of the TV watching the Towers burn. I was 9 years old.
For much of the East Coast, 9/11 started as a peaceful morning that quickly devolved into a living nightmare. On the West Coast, most of us woke up to that nightmare.
