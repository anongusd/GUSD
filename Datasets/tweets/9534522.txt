Shin Lim, who just won “America’s Got Talent” (season 13 and Champions edition) is live at Foxwoods in CT on April 26. I have 2 tickets that include a VIP meet-and-greet—but now I can’t go. I’m selling them for what I paid ($150 each)! Shoot me a note if interested, pogue@me.com.
@MikeCoogan Hi Mike… no, I do not. New York magazine’s “Strategist” site does, though. They work on Wirecutter’s model—if you order something they’ve profiled, they get a cut of it.
@laurcoo I shall!
@Ed_11364 Yes indeed! Not as many colors for Android, but it’s there!
I’m happy to announce my new micro-column in New York magazine’s “Strategist” section—in which I review tech products that I actually wound up buying myself! Today: a phone bumper that makes the screen crack-proof. https://t.co/CDPmSEAaib https://t.co/tGQwLWschO

@mjcp Apparently, “The Guilty” is the Danish entry for Foreign Language Oscar. So we’ll see! :)
YES! “The Guilty” is now rentable (Amazon, YouTube, Vudu, etc.) Basically a one-man, one-set thriller, set in a 911 call center…completely brilliant. Gets 99% on Rotten Tomatoes. Danish with subtitles. Saw it at a film fest last year—so happy it’s seeing the light of day!

@davemarkturk @1Password I gotcha. Apple's built-in solution also requires you to click and choose from a pop-up menu for each field... I'm looking for a solution that would auto-fill. Thanks, though!
@1Password OK, great, thank you! So there's no way to have it auto-populate the Username and Password fields (and even press Enter to complete the login), as Dashlane does?
@mgeerdes @terryreck @1Password My computer is password-protected....also, I work at home, so "anyone" would be my family. If you're saying that 1Password requires you to type a password (your master) every time you ever have to log into something, how does that save you time!?
@ericdsa @1Password Well, nobody can be expected to use ALL the password managers! (I'd been using Dashlane.)
@terryreck @1Password I'd been using Dashlane before that! Which auto-fills without the need for a keystroke!
@1Password Hi there! I'm trying 1Password for the first time, in Safari on the Mac. I was hoping that it might autofill my passwords...it seems instead that I have to go up to the menu bar, open the passwords list, and manually choose the site's password. Really!? Thanks!

@morid1n @Tesla That doesn’t help. Even if your hands remain on the wheel at all times, you still get the prompt to “apply pressure.”
Dear @Tesla owners: I just discovered the coolest tip. When you’re on Autopilot and the car tells you to “apply light pressure” to the wheel to let it know that you’re still paying attention, you can just roll the volume ball a notch instead. Quicker and easier.
@pdxtraveller1 A fine question! Sales of tech books are indeed wayyyyyy down. That’s why I keep only 3 of mine alive, the three fattest topics: Windows, Mac, and iPhone!

@UrValsson Yes, agreed! Anti-American is a very good way to put it!
@jakecocola Texas allows a few Tesla “galleries,” where you can look at the cars—but you cannot buy them, or even discuss buying them.
Incredible though it may seem, as many as 16 states actually have laws barring Tesla from opening up stores. Here’s my report on these 80-year-old laws (and very modern lobbyists) who are responsible. https://t.co/d3Xl0rguEu https://t.co/KAqxGqWNBU

@ChengxiangX The main thing you can do is to communicate with your state representatives. I was told that the car dealerships are in constant touch with the state legislators – but when have you ever spoken to them? You know?

@Romare @CBSSunday But as our "CBS Sunday Morning" story pointed out, for mild hearing loss, those are probably all you need, and save you a TON of money.
@Romare @CBSSunday Hey Romare! Seems as though you bought PSAPs (not technically hearing aids)—the fact that they’re being sold as “hearing aids” could be illegal! But clearly, they’re not the same as the $5000 thingies. https://t.co/zlZ6dW9Vlw

RT @CBSSunday: David @Pogue checked out the latest advances in hearing aid technology that have reduced size and added unique features, and…
@dewgal63 @CBSSunday Oh, that’s fantastic!! Yeah, you could save THOUSANDS of bucks by going over-the-counter!
@ZithRob @CBSSunday Oh wow… what a story, Rob. Well, here’s hoping that your mom can benefit from the new wave of these technologies…

@RJKelley1 @CBSSunday LOL!! You won’t tell anyone, though, will you?
In cased you missed it this morning, here’s my “@CBSSunday Morning” cover story about the dawning new era in hearing aids. It’s online! https://t.co/IqKb4iJE62
@thinkofdave That’s exactly right. I know “deregulation” is a loaded word, but this industry really needed it.
@jrobboz @CBSSunday Hey Jan! Yes, it will be posted online after it airs. I’ll tweet the link.
@mjstover @CBSSunday LOL!! You’re a sitting duck for that tweet!

@LucidInferno @RichardW78 OMG!! How on earth— ok, that’s the most succinct story of my life I’ve ever heard. Much better than my attempts.
@butlerjf Well put!
@crowdedhereeh Well, there’s a LITTLE more to it than that. Apple has made enormous environmental strides—for example, the new phones are made with 100% sustainable power, and the new GiveBack program is pretty great.
@ehed Ahhhhhh! So maybe that’s the difference?
@sms1013 The Lytro camera changed FOCUS. The new iPhone feature just changes how blurry the background is—does not change focus.

@peds48 Thank you — I will! Can you tell me your browser and OS?
It’s official. The iPhone SE is dead. The last 4-inch iPhone, beloved by the small of hand, is no longer available.
@rtbrown76 Rob, I’m not being a dick. The context is that I was BEAT UP on Twitter for tweeting about Apple’s announcement, saying I “fell for it,” etc.
Here it what Apple’s rep said onstage about the Apple Watch’s new EKG (ECG) feature, verbatim: “This is the first ECG product offered over the counter, directly to consumers.” That appears to be flat-out wrong—or am I missing something? https://t.co/OC2JWRlqr8
@t_vv_itter For sure—Android is far more customizable! The flip side, of course, is that also makes it somewhat more complicated. Different folks prefer different approaches.
@chandra1250 @gassee Oh man, can you imagine? There’d be blood in the streets!
@heyyoudvd YES! Couldn't agree more!
@bdelbanco Good points!
@DPaskin @Apple Nope! No word. No idea what happened to them, or to the charging pad, or the new laptop. Maybe there’ll be an October event.
@willikampmann Yeah, it’s super confusing. As I understand it, what the “transfer settings” sends is your Apple ID and your WiFi password, so you don’t have to enter that stuff manually. Just saves a LITTLE time before restoring the backup from iCloud.
Every time there’s a new iPhone or Samsung Galaxy, Twitter goes nuts: “MY phone has had that feature for YEARS!” So I decided to figure out: Who steals more feature ideas: Apple, Google, or Samsung? A semi-scientific study. https://t.co/iMwu5Pd5sG https://t.co/5J3MThh2fM

@bdelbanco Very. https://t.co/1YAqsVkOw2
@MrTobyCook Agreed!!
@Deborah_Mae Yes, $1000 or more! Here’s my writeup. https://t.co/1YAqsVkOw2
@joemunte Sure. For $160.
@mohammadlone Yes, I would. The 2x zoom lens is REALLY useful… I use it daily!
@PaulSGundlach Agreed! Well, your wish HALF comes true: In iOS 12, you’ll be able to close apps with a simple swipe up again.
@bjshourt That was how Apple phrased it...
One thing the new iPhone’s WON’T come with: The standard headphone-cord adapter. If you have traditional headphones, you’re on the hook for the $9 adapter. https://t.co/YoyGedDdB2
@DunnMan77 AGREED. 64gb is basically unusable!
@ashokk I guess in my mind, Siri or TouchID really changes HOW YOU USE THE PHONE. A bigger screen is certainly nice, but doesn’t change your routine...
@t_vv_itter LOL! No, I actually got it WRONG the first time. Happy that Twitter folk are keeping me honest!
@WarmGingerTea Thanks for these updates! I’ll dig in and report back!
@t_vv_itter Yes—you’re right! The Apple Watch is the first FDA-approved WEARABLE over-the-counter ECG device, not device in general.
@piskov @gruber That is BIZARRE!
@jaimebarillas Thanks for the heads-up! I’ll investigate.
@dguisinger I dunno. Seems like a minor speed boost to me, but analyst Tim @Bajarin told me it’s a much bigger deal—could open up all kinds of new app possibilities.
Annnnnd here it is: My first impressions of the three new X-class iPhones, based on an hour’s hands-on session! Full review to come. https://t.co/aCiywzlD2l https://t.co/ZsFAX84Fjk
@kreylix YES!! They fixed that in iOS 12! No more accidental screenshots!!
@Normanguy Yeah…I’m guessing those were delayed till October!
@WarmGingerTea Ahhhh, thanks for the heads-up!
@jtkool_ Good question! I’ll investigate.
@HarwellThrasher Oh, thanks for the heads-up!
@chefgeorgeduran It sure looks like the iPhone 9 will never happen!
@MJRagain Yes, the iPhone 7 is now $450 and up; the iPhone 8 is now $600 and up.
@HughHansen Well, LESS of a fake. At least it’s using actual depth data to distinguish the background. But you have a point!
@VossSr The new phones are still very slippery. They’re waterproof, yes—can survive 30 minutes, six feet underwater.
@RealDavidArt I’m guessing those were delayed!
@elguaje07 It’s looking like the SE is done. :(
And that’s it from Cupertino! Clearly, this is an “S” year for iPhones. :) I’ll be posting a hands-on iPhone Xs and Xr report in a couple of hours at https://t.co/CAJmv34nZu—where the team has full coverage of all the announcements today! #AppleEvent2018 https://t.co/d1ZXe4ArUE
Annnnnd now the prices. iPhone Xr, the cheapie, starts at $750 (for 64GB), ships Oct 26. iPhone Xs starts at $1000. The big Xs Max starts at $1100. Add more for more storage (up to 512 on the Xs—ships Sept 21). Models 7 and 8 still available. #AppleEvent2018 https://t.co/2OloWCBz6P
The new iPhone Xr (“ten-R”) doesn’t have two lenses on the back, like the other X phones—but they’ve still created Portrait mode (blurry photo backgrounds), using software. Pretty good fake. #AppleEvent2018 https://t.co/BemKMYT9KZ
And now, the 3rd new model: iPhone Xr (“ten-R”), the cheaper one. Black, white, red, yellow, coral, red, or blue aluminum. No zoom (dual) lens, no 3D Touch, 6.1” LCD screen (not OLED), but otherwise like a slightly bigger iPhone X: Face ID, waterproof. #AppleEvent2018 https://t.co/paFrAs9EVk
Some impressive environmental advances announced by Apple. Example: New iPhones use recycled logic-board material—that one change will eliminate the mining of 10,000 tons of tin ore a year. The plastic frame is 30% recycled material. #AppleEvent2018
Last updates on the new iPhone Xs (I think): dual SIM tech (using e-SIM for the 2nd line), so you can have 2 phone numbers. Also, 30 min more life per charge (than iPhone X). 90 min more on the jumbo Xs Max phone. #AppleEvent2018 https://t.co/a586yIYTw6
New iPhone Xs models (say it with me, now—“Ten-S”) have upgraded camera. Better, faster HDR. Also, you can now ADUST the depth of field (blurriness in background) of a Portrait-mode shot after the fact. OK, THAT is pretty great. #AppleEvent2018 https://t.co/8eL7wJqTbX
@tnypxl Well, yes… “S” models traditionally add SOMETHING more besides speed. The 4S offered Siri. The 5S, Touch ID and M7 chip. The 6S, optical image stabilization.
@pat_makhoul Well, “S” models have traditionally added SOMETHING more besides speed. The 4S offered Siri. The 5S, Touch ID and M7 chip. The 6S, optical image stabilization. Always, better cameras.
@bereasonable2 Yeah, but “S” models traditionally add SOMETHING besides speed. The 4S introduced Siri. The 5S, Touch ID and M7 chip. The 6S, optical image stabilization.
@davidjschloss Well, what’s weird is that “S” models traditionally add SOMETHING more besides speed. The 4S offered Siri. The 5S, Touch ID and M7 chip. The 6S, optical image stabilization.
Apple execs onstage are talking about the new iPhone Xs models—and glowingly describing OLD features, like OLED screen and Face ID. In other words, there appears to be not a single new feature! I mean, faster chip, but so far, that’s it. Weeeeird. #AppleEvent2018 https://t.co/apIz8PpMVD
@trevorlong Oops!! Yes—sorry! Deleted that tweet and corrected...
Oopsie—I meant to say the iPhone Xs is pronounced “TEN-S,” even though you may consider it excessive. Available in 5.8” (iPhone Xs) or 6.5” sizes (Xs Max). Tougher glass, more waterproof (IP68), wider stereo. #AppleEvent2018 https://t.co/7XlblKWwcq https://t.co/YJURzHbGH0
Apple Watch 4 available Sept 21 for $400, or $500 with cellular (plus $10/month). Battery life… still one day ong. AUUUGH! Series 3 still available at $280. #AppleEvent2018 https://t.co/VHkfz32eoP
@Chanchai_NS Yes, all Apple Watch bands still fit…
RT @Mikedecicco: it’ll come in handy for when you see how much it costs https://t.co/tVWYGRd0Nv
Holy moly. Apple Watch 4 has sensors built into the back and crown that lets you take your own ECG (electrocardiogram)—first ever over-the-counter device. Detects atrial fibrillation. A HUGE lifesaving development. #AppleEvent2018 https://t.co/jFtX7XFeKU
More on Apple Watch 4: 50% louder speaker, haptic-clicky crown, radio-permeable back panel for better cellular, up to 2x faster, detects falls and notifies contacts. Detects heart rate either too high or too low. #AppleEvent2018 https://t.co/uDRdBCIbo8
New Apple Watch 4. Screen pushed to the edges, making it 32% or 35% larger. Also thinner. A little more rectangular. More watch faces. #AppleEvent2018 https://t.co/yMiPMhAmal
First up: Apple Watch. Cook says it’s the bestselling single watch model in the world (still no sales figs, though). #AppleEvent2018 https://t.co/rvHc4waeaz

The one place on earth where the line is for the MEN’S room: a developer conference. #wwdc18 https://t.co/idj85A6BQR
And that is all from the Apple #WWDC18 keynote presentation! I’ll post my deep-dive writeups on @YahooFinance later today—or get my stuff by email here https://t.co/ClOUcpB5Bj !
Apple just unveiled a sneak peek at a multi-year project to let software companies bring their iOS apps to the Mac, with very few changes. (But emphatically says the idea is NOT to merge MacOS and iOS. “NO!”) #WWDC18
Mac OS Mojave this fall gains many iOS apps, like News, Stocks, Voice Memos, and Home (for Siri-conrtollable smart-home apps). #WWDC18
MacOS Mojave: New screenshot tool works like iOS: produces a thumbnail that opens into editing tools. Also can capture video. Also, Continuity Camera: Take a photo with your iPhone, shows up instantly in your Mac document. Same for scanning documents. #WWDC18
MacOS Mojave: “new” Gallery view (basically same as old Cover Flow view). New sidebar on the right showing metadata of selected icon, including Quick Actions like Rotate (for a JPEG) or “Add password” (for a PDF). Markup in QuickLook now. #WWDC18
This fall: Mac OS Mojave. System-wide “dark mode” (affects all apps). Wallpaper photos that shift lighting through the day. And Desktop stacks: “piles” of icons auto-organized to keep you tidy. #WWDC18 https://t.co/sUnCydnUKx
@govinbhai Well, more like Apple ANIMATED Bitmoji.
Apple TV gains “zero sign-on” (don’t have to enter name/password into each app), and new screensaver flyovers shot from the Space Station. #WWDC18 https://t.co/KijQiKfigj
@DXZDB NO… I gotta get on that!
Apple TV, this fall, gets Dolby Atmos sound. (It’s the only box to have both Dolby Vision and Atmos, Apple says.) All your existing movies will be auto-upgraded free. #WWDC18
More on Apple Watch OS 5: Podcasts; interactive notifications (rate your Lyft ride, etc.); don’t have to say “hey siri” anymore (just raise your wrist). You’ll still have to charge the watch every damn night, though. #WWDC18 https://t.co/lMAL7f9lq9
Apple Watch OS 5, this fall: New Walkie-Talkie app, watch-to-watch. Also: Auto workout detection (start and stop), plus new workout types for Yoga, Hiking, Outdoor Runs. #WWDC18
@lobstaman LOL!
iOS 12 this fall will, at last, offer group FaceTime… video calls with up to 32 people at once. Built into Messages, too, so you can hop from a group chat to a group call. #WWDC18
Remember Apple’s animated emoji? In iOS 12, you can create “Memoji,” where you design one that looks like YOU. Can now include your tongue sticking out. How did we LIVE before this? #WWDC18 https://t.co/hr43Yze5Kl
iOS 12 will let you set time limits for your kids—by app, by time of day, etc. You can manage this remotely, from your own phone. Or set time limits for YOURSELF! (“5 min left to use Instagram,” is the example they’re showing.) #WWDC18
Apple follows Google’s lead with “digital health” app: New Screen Time app shows time you spend on the phone, in each app (or set app time limits), how many times you glance a day, etc. #WWDC18 https://t.co/aNFEBEgUXR
@GrendelRob You’re not kidding!!
In iOS 12, CarPlay will let you use non-Apple apps like Waze and Google Maps on your dashboard! THIS is a big deal, at least for people with CarPlay. #WWDC18
Another example of Siri Shortcuts in iOS 12: You say “Heading home,” and Siri sets your thermostat at home, texts your spouse, shows you when you’ll arrive, and starts playing your favorite podcast. Me likey. #WWDC18
iOS 12 comes with new Siri Shortcuts app. Drag-and-drop app to build your own queries. For example, say “Travel plans” to open a screen with your hotel/flight/meal reservations (drawn from Kayak app). Hundreds of premade shortcuts available. #WWDC18
iOS 12 Photos, after an event or a dinner out, will suggest a subset of those photos to send to the other guests—and even suggest their addresses. When they receive your pix, THEIR Photos app suggests THEIR pix of the same event to send to YOU. #WWDC18
Apple’s new ARkit 2 will permit multi-player aug-reality games. That is, 2 or more people, standing in different places, will see the same virtual 3D scene from their own angles, and play together. THAT will be cool. #WWDC18 https://t.co/vpMOehoGZX
iOS 12 will come with a new aug-reality app called Measure. I feel bad for all the people who have existing AR tape-measure apps! #wwdc18 https://t.co/R8zNWcf1Hn
Apple teamed with Pixar to invent a new file format for augmented reality scenes, called .USDZ. Adobe suite, Autodesk, and Sketchfab will all adopt it. Offers WYSIWIG editing in AR. #WWDC18
iOS 12, coming this fall: All about speed. Runs on all the same phones and iPads as iOS 11. Apps open up to 40% faster, keyboard appears up to 50%, open camera app up to 70% faster. #WWDC18
Let’s try again, without my typo: Tim Cook onstage, offering stats. App store turns 10 years old; 500 million visitors a week; has earned developers $100 BILLION so far. #WWDC18
Apple’s #WWWDC18 begins with a hilarious parody of a nature film… “The developer. Once a year, comes out of hibernation for this extraordinary gathering…”
@baseballgods16 HA!
I’m at Apple’s big show, #WWDC18, which starts in 7 minutes. The emphasis is supposed to be greater stability, fewer bugs. Well, the show’s WiFi network is down. Not off to a great start!

@Jim_Lipsey Well, I would imagine yes, but only after you ignore three weeks worth of warnings!
@CuriousHenwin Yep—That warning is in there!

@BobaHalbfett They did ask permission! But I assumed they were basically retweeting it… that happens all the time. Companies quote my reviews, just as movie ads quote reviewers…is this different?
@BobaHalbfett It’s fine with me if they (Sonos) want to promote the results of my independent testing, just the way car companies brag about getting a JD Power award or whatever… or is there more to a “promoted tweet” that I’m missing?
@BobaHalbfett Paying me!?!? OMG seriously? No professional reviewer would accept a bribe. That’d kill your credibility instantly.
@BobaHalbfett Because apparently, they were pleased by the results and then promoted it (AFTER the test was over).

@jdmuccigrosso True—but then why didn’t the CENTER listeners prefer B, the HomePod, which was right in front of them?
@alanh42 Yes, as noted in the column, we used an audio meter to match the volume before the test.
@markbooth I’m not sure. The fabric was a 1-ply sheet of nylon—you can see through it! Also, remember that the dress-rehearsal people uniformly preferred the HomePod, in the same setup.
@JazzStevo That’s a great theory, and a great diagram! The only problem is: Why didn’t the center people then prefer B or C?
@Jeffinatorator Hi Jeff—no, I hadn’t used the room correction software.
@JohnPaczkowski @lisatozzi @itsnicolenguyen John, I specified “young” as a credit to her youthful HEARING, which is relevant in this case. We lose frequencies as we age, so a young reviewer would, in theory, hear more than I do. “Young” is relevant here.
@settern @itsnicolenguyen Nicole (@itsnicolenguyen) graduated college in 2012, which would make her about 28 now. The reason “young” is important in this context is that, as my column pointed out, we lose hearing frequencies as we age! It’s a compliment—to differentiate her hearing from mine (54).
@mcwm Well, “young” in this case is important, for the reason that our hearing frequencies decline as we age!
@apag @jocrz @gruber I’m quite certain that if they sat with their backs to the speakers, the test would be criticized because our ears are “shaped forward,” as sound scoops!
@ErikVeland @gruber I’ve asked Apple to clarify if Spotify over AirPlay would have any lower quality than Apple Music over AirPlay. If so, I’ll redo the test (and SHAME on it!).
@gruber @laloreyes @jocrz That is correct, sir. Each panelist was asked to take notes and to record a ranking for each speaker in each test.
@jdmuccigrosso Yes, very interesting indeed! The “A” side people were indeed on the “A” speaker side…!
@BrianCBock @across04 No… there were only 2 people in the dress rehearsal. Sitting on the same couch—same positions as TWO of the final panelists…
@JohnPlatner Yes, I had to use AirPlay to get the Spotify to play.
@osaddict No, I think you’re right. I’m hearing a lot about this…that Apple menu streaming sounds much better than Spotify. I’ll test it!
@lores3000 Yeah, agreed. It’s got to be something like that...
@toxicpath @across04 Well, except that the dress rehearsal, with a different panel, all voted HomePod the best player—same setup!
@mguillau @Bose Yes, they are! …but they’re not voice-controlled “smart” speakers, like the ones in my roundup.
@across04 It’s possible—but don’t forget that the curtain was also there for the dress rehearsal, with totally different results (the HomePod won)!
@Kermit262 Thanks, Bob! Yes, I was really stunned! Anyway… that thing sounds pretty great, huh?
@KenCCheng Oops! You already followed up!

@pquade Right. We actually had a debate about that line! “Just like last year’s Samsung” refers only to the feature checklist—not how it works!
@THEmrMATTERS @CBSNews @CBSSunday Mainly because over a billion people HAVE this phone. So it’s of inherent interest to a huge number of viewers. (Same with the Samsung.)
@IrvSwerve Yeah, the assignment was a little 2-minute “essay”...

@jlock4820 Oh god… Thank you…
@bing_dicklepuss Won’t work. Eyes have to be looking at the phone.
@RichardW78 @Apple Ohhhh, I see! Yeah, that’s a great question! I would guess “hold longer,” but I’ll find out!
@RichardW78 @Apple You press the button without holding it, exactly as you do now. :)
@CanonFodder @RichardW78 There are adapters that let you do that…
@RichardW78 I don’t think so, but I’m asking Apple!
@RADjoshua Nope—has to be on its back. Although, of course, you could flip the pad upside-down so they’re BOTH face down!

Today on “Midday Movers,” I tackled some of Twitter’s nutso concerns over the iPhone X’s face recognition… https://t.co/aPH246oFtD
@TerryKPickett Sure. Type “Pogue Apple Watch” into Google.
@ww917352 It’s not just looking at the phone. You have to WAKE it (pick it up or press the Sleep switch) before you can look at it.
@veeman60 WOW. That’s a profound and disturbing article. Makes perfect sense, though.
@rolfje Neither one will work on Face ID. You have to be looking at the phone. And video won’t work. Neither will photos or masks.
@ww917352 It’s the same as Touch ID. It’ll be turned off if “a bunch of people” touch the Home button!
@ww917352 And how often does THAT happen!?
@hankchang I see it the other way! It’s really sad when 30 tech publications write that the technology doesn’t work—when it actually does!
@ZazayaGFC I'm afraid I don't know! I'll ask.
@AlexnNYC Yep. Same problem with fingerprint readers. Or do this: https://t.co/2li2UkfTQQ

@KarlEgas No, it won’t work with eyes closed. The blind person would have to open his/her eyes—or just use the passcode.
@heazey_marpy No, your eyes have to be open and looking at the phone.
@DVEllice There’s a big difference, though. Windows Hello, and iPhone X, use DEPTH cameras—so you can’t fool ‘em with a photo.
@melis_tx No, because your eyes have to be open for Face ID to work!
Heard from Apple on what happened when Face ID “failed” onstage. My 1st theory was wrong; my 2nd wasn’t. Details: https://t.co/lQWUmk5UnT
@pradym That’s right. So you would type in your password in that case. (Same thing if your fingerprint got damaged.)
@JackAubrey3 @Digmyearth I'm afraid I don't know! But you’d have the same problem with fingerprints, no?
@johnrooksjr That’s exactly right. The same car accident would cut your finger. But we don’t worry about THAT, do we?
@Digmyearth No. You have to be looking at the phone for Face ID to work.
@petefrompa You don’t have to use Face ID. You can stick with the password.
@Boston_Training Then you’d use your password.
@merovee458 You can indeed use a password instead. Face ID is optional.
@GhostDog36C Then tell her your password. Or teach it to learn HER face.
You may not like the idea of face recognition to unlock phones, but “What if I’m in a car accident”? Come on. (Hint: Type your password.)
@jtkool_ Hm. I don’t see that in the video… do you have some inside info? Because each try requires moving it into view, and he didn’t do that..

@cpkkings Oh, lord, not everything Apple! I recall PANNING the Apple Watch, Apple Music, revamped iMovie, iCloud, many more!
@cpkkings I agree about the copying. In the real world, though, not sure who cares. People in the Apple ecosystem can’t easily switch anyway…
@MattJohnsonPhD YES! Oopsie! Fixing that now… Many thanks!
@justindrew On the iPhone X, you swipe down from the TOP for the Control Center.
@gavproductions Good question! The iPhone X can display HDR video, but no other phones.
@markjenniskens I think only when you’re touching the screen? I’ll investigate.
@louisyiwenluo No, not always there…I think maybe only when you’re touching? I’ll inquire!
@mcontant that's an excellent question!…
@cpkkings i'm not sure where you get that idea – did you ever read my reviews of the Apple Watch, or Apple Music?

And, as rumored, now the price for the iPhone X: 64gb for $1000. Also available in 256gb. Order Oct 27, ships Nov 3. (iPhone 8 still $700.)
No, that’s the best part of the iPhone X. It’s a “smaller” body like the iPhone 7, with the big screen like the 7 Plus. https://t.co/gxKVOz3cvf
Next year: Apple will sell a big charging mat that can charge iPhone 8, iPhone X, AirPods (with new case), and Apple Watch SIMULTANEOUSLY. https://t.co/Fj0EwkBhdj
On the iPhone X, now the FRONT camera can do Portrait mode (blurry background) and studio lighting, too. That’s cool. #AppleEvent
iPhone X 12 megapixel cameras: Faster, better, both lenses (1X and 2X) are stabilized now. #AppleEvent
iPhone X: No Home button, so much relearning. Swipe up for multitasking; swipe DOWN for Control Center. (No word on making screenshots.)
@DaOfficialKyra It’s pronounced “iPhone ten."
@kennylozano81 Yes, Face ID works in the dark.
New on iPhone X: Animated emoji, sent in Messages, that change their expressions to match YOURS (via camera). #AppleEvent
iPhone X Face ID can’t be fooled by photos, masks, or even models of your head. You can change your hair, glasses, facial hair. #AppleEvent
iPhone X: No more fingerprint reader. Now, you LOOK at it (Face ID). Floods your face with IR in 3D. Can’t be fooled by photo. #AppleEvent
iPhone X: 5.8” OLED screen (2436x1125 pixels). Million-to-1 contrast ratio. Tap screen to wake it, swipe up for Home Screen. #AppleEvent https://t.co/RU5zgxXIEm
ONE MORE THING: the iPhone X! As rumored: ALL SCREEN, edge to edge, top to bottom. No Home button. Gray or silver. #AppleEvent https://t.co/lw2OeCGZZ6
iPhone 8 can charge on a Qi pad (from any company). Your savings: Plugging in a cable. Apple envisions pads in cars, airports, cafés.
Sample AR apps shown: Watch a live ballgame, see player names and stats superimposed. Look at sky, see stars identified. #AppleEvent
iPhone 8: New gyro, accelerometer, processor, motion tracking intended for new augmented reality apps. #AppleEvent
Wow. iPhone 8 Plus’s dual cameras, in Portrait mode, can simulate various studio-lighting face FX. Hard to describe; stunning. #AppleEvent
iPhone 8 new cameras. Once again, the Plus has 2 lenses (1x and 2x). (NOTE: iPhone 8 is NOT the hot new $1000 model, iPhone X. That’s next.)
@Uncle___Rico That’s coming up next (a different model)!
Here we go: iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Glass front &amp; back. Silver, gold, or black. 50% stronger glass. Faster. #AppleEvent https://t.co/fIuXFSQkP1
@gottlife Yes, later this year.
Later this year, Apple TV will get live sports and news. (Home-screen thumbnails will show current scores to help you decide.) #AppleEvent
Apple’s 4K movies will cost no more than HD movies. And if you’ve bought an iTunes movie, Apple will upgrade it to 4K for free.
OK, now the Apple TV box. Now streams 4K shows, HDR video (high-dynamic range) for superior brights/darks—at least if you own a 4K TV.
Apple Watch 3 starts at $400 with cellular, $330 without. Ships 9/22. (No word on battery impact or cost of cellular plan.) #AppleEvent
More bands and colors for the Apple Watch. I’ve never quite understood why Apple considers new band designs such an achievement. #AppleEvent https://t.co/5SBaeS8jmr
@axelmobil Runners and athletes, mainly.
Apple Watch 3: Faster. Tracks flights of stairs. Siri speaks aloud now. The screen IS the antenna. No room for SIM card, so it’s electronic. https://t.co/BeImC5Qcde
Apple Watch 3. Same looks, but cellular. You can go without your phone and still get calls, texts, Internet, maps, stream music. #AppleEvent
New Apple Watch OS feature: Alerts you if elevated pulse when you’re not active. Also launching atrial fibrillation study. #AppleEvent
Tim Cook reports that the Apple Watch is now the #1 bestselling watch in the world. But he still won’t say how many he’s sold.
Correction: Apple is now calling its retail stores “Apple Town Squares.” Daily classes, photo safaris in the neighborhood, etc.

(Corrected link!) Today’s Google Doodle (animation on homepage) is a charming tribute to Mr. Trololo! Story: https://t.co/oysTOFEAvJ
@Cycomiko That’s an excellent question! I’m guessing that people would care a LOT more!

@seancowdrey Well, that’s the irony, right? I’m sure it’s an emotional support dog. But what about the REST of us!?
@JackAubrey3 I do indeed! Unfortunately, they block only steady midtown sounds like engines… :)
Someone brought a tiny dog onto this flight, and it keeps frantically yipping. Wonder what the airline’s policy is for THAT?

@Romestantc Yes, exactly! Crazy. But very tidy and convenient.
@TomMattaBigBand He won’t stay away! :( Keeps chasing the cursor...
@charles4271 Indeed yes!
@drsnazzy I had the same view—and then I saw that I could buy non-Apple power chargers for $30 for this laptop (instead of $80 for Apple’s)!
@drsnazzy No, not just monitor! That cord also carries audio and video AND charges the laptop!
@randyscovil LOL! Let’s hear it for Huge Orange Cats!
@maccast AGREED!! x1000...
@lonseidman It supplies 60 watts. So it will charge the 15-incher, just not as fast as the Apple charger.

@jelmer_jonkman @YahooFinance @LIFX AUUGHH! You’re right!! I blew that. :(
@paulmayne I haven’t seen that, but I was looking for 60W for my 13-incher!
@SonyRumors No, these are made by Dell, HP, etc… so I’m not expecting quality problems
@yuusharo Some are name brands—Dell’s is $28, for example...
@yuusharo That’s just my point—you no longer have to pay for Apple-branded chargers! Amazon lists tons by other companies, much cheaper.
Apple changed the charger on the new MacBooks—to standard USB-C. $30 for a second one—$9 for a car charger! Don’t need to buy Apple brand!

Now a song by Sia, and that’s it from San Francisco. No new laptops—in fact, no mention of Macs. But the iPhone 7 is sweet! #AppleEvent
Those wireless AirPods will be $160 (gulp). Late October. #AppleEvent
iPhone 7 pricing: same as before. $650 and up, but double the storage (32, 128, 256 gb). 7 Plus: $770, same configs. #AppleEvent
Correction (sorry): iPhone 7 gets 2 hours more battery life than iPhone 6s. #AppleEvent
iPhone 7 Plus battery: 2 hours a day longer than iPhone 6s. #AppleEvent
iPhone 7: New processor has 4 cores. Two are for low-intensity calculations to save battery power. #AppleEvent
My guess: the wireless AirPods won’t stay in some ears. Fortunately, 2 new Beats earbuds have ear hooks for people like me. #appleEvent
The wireless AirPods come with a charging case that’s also a battery, for 24 hours of music. #AppleEvent
New wireless Apple AirPods. 5 hours music per charge. Charging case. IR sensors detect when in ears. Tap for Siri. Noise cancel. #AppleEvent
Phil Schiller explains killing the headphone jack: That old connector took up HUGE space inside. And wireless is the new thing. #AppleEvent
iPhone 7: Stereo spkers (first on iPhone), 2x the volume. Earbuds connect to Lightning jack. Headphone adapter included in box. #appleEvent
iPhone 7 Plus: New Portrait mode adds lovely soft-focus background (bokeh, or “depth effect”). #AppleEvent
Correction (sorry): iPhone 7 optical zoom up to 2x, digital up to 10X. #AppleEvent
iPhone 7: Optical zoom up to 5X, additional digital zoom to 10X. First non-thick phone with true zoom. #AppleEvent
iPhone 7 Plus: Two 12-megapixel cameras. One for wide, one for telephoto—they combine for OPTICAL ZOOM ON SMARTPHONE. Boom. #AppleEvent
iPhone 7 camera: Optical stabilization. f1.8 lens. 4-color flash, 50% brighter, face+body recognition. #AppleEvent
iPhone 7: The new Home button vibrates as feedback. The body is water resistant (finally). Oh—and no headphone jack. :) #AppleEvent
More iPhone 7 details: Comes in shiny black, matte black, gold, silver, rose gold. Home button customizable+force-sensitive. #AppleEvent
iPhone 7 unveiled: Dual lenses (big bump on the back), gorgeous SHINY aluminum body. No headphone jack. #AppleEvent
Apple Watch Series 2 starts at $370; old version $270. Coming late Sept.…Still can’t track your sleep, still 1 day battery life #AppleEvent

Tim Cook says Apple is now the #2 biggest watch vendor (by $$ volume), after Rolex. But still not saying HOW MANY he’s sold. #AppleEvent

Tim Cook giving the usual total wave of impressive tallies. 140 billion app downloads. (130 of them were Pokemon Go, I’m guessing.)

@SwitchAngel1975 @Redeemed1952 You are right! I’d tried to darken the moon without losing the stars. But the shot was real… I’ve reposted!
Let’s try that moon again! (Bad Photoshop layer rectangle in first post—I’d tried to adjust the moon brightness!) http://t.co/5EiFPtD4Zc
@kirwijo Sorry—bad Photoshop layer edit! The shot’s not fake—just my attempt to brighten the moon without affecting the background!
@chloeneill wow. Not yet, but I haven't really tried it!

Here's our complete writeup on the new iPad Pro: Apple Introduces Enormous iPad Pro with Apple Pencil StylusApple'... http://t.co/Af8xKvPp5P
Apple announces iPhone Upgrade Program in Apple stores: Pay $32/month, get a new iPhone to use every year. With AppleCare+ insurance.
iPhone 6s prices: $200, $300, $400 (for 16, 64, and 128gb, with contract). Plus models $100 more. Same as before.
The "live photo" videos get taken automatically every time you snap a shot. (Captures 1.5 sec before and after the moment you snap.) Wild.
iPhone 6s: "Live photos": Photos with four-second videos that play when you hard-press. With sound. Weird.
When you're taking a selfie, the iPhone 6s flashes the screen in an appropriate color to make your skin tones look good. #appleevent
The iPhone 6s can capture 4K videos....but can't play them back. (The screen doesn't have 8 million pixels.)
63 megapixel panoramas!
More in the iPhone 6s: fingerprint recognition 2x faster. New 12 megapixel camera--and more importantly, tech to make them BETTER pixels.
RT @Bruce_Watson_: @Pogue You know a product has peaked when it's offered in colors.
iPhone 6s home-screen icons have shortcut menus, too. Phone app: speed-dial names. Camera: options like Selfie. Map: "Directions home."
New iPhone touch screen: Press lightly for a preview (of a message, photo, map, link etc.). Keep finger down to open it. #appleevent
iPhone 6s's "even stronger glass screen" offers "3D touch" (pressure sensitivity). Press harder for a shortcut menu.
The new iPhones look the same as before, but there’s a rose gold option (pinkish), and the innards are different. http://t.co/QnfEKqHjXc
( I mean, they look exactly the same as last year's models.)
OK, here we go. Tim Cook revealing the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. Whoa--they look--EXACTLY THE SAME! #appleevent
OK, here we go. Tim Cook revealing the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. Whoa--they look--EXACTLY THE SAME!
AppleTV remote uses Bluetooth (don't have to point it at the TV anymore), 3 months on a charge, recharges via Lightning jack. $150 and $200.
Apple TV: Watch 2 baseball games simultaneously. (But can my kid watch a movie at the same time, too?)
So, Apple TV = games, shopping, Siri, apps? Has a trackpad? Apple clearly has MUCH bigger ambitions for it now. It's a laptop for your TV!
Whoa. The Apple TV remote apparently has an accelerometer, too, so you can swing it like a Wii remote for playing baseball games and stuff.
You can ask Apple TV questions that Siri does on the phone--about sports, weather, music, etc. Answers appear in a panel below your movie.
"Show me that 'Modern Family' episode with Edward Norton." Apple TV pulls it up. Nice. #appleevent
Apple TV searches all the different online video stores with a single Siri query. That's rather awesome. #appleevent http://t.co/70detuWi8P
"Show me family movies." "Just the new ones." "Anything with Jason Bateman." Apple TV comes w a voice-activated (Siri) remote. #appleevent
The Apple TV is getting an app store. Does that mean it will finally have Amazon Video?
RT @vgirotto: @Pogue It just seems like they didn't learn from the Surface: a lot of the complaints with it were "lapability", viewing angl…
Correction! iPad Pro $800, $950, and $1080 for 32gb, 128, and 128+cellular. And the Pencil is $100.
If you kind of squint, iPad Pro + keyboard cover = Microsoft Surface 3. Apple's take on the hybrid laptop, in other words. #appleevent
Keyboard cover + stylus aren't new ideas, but it seems clear that Apple has Apple-ized them--improved the a lot. Gonna be a hit. #appleevent
Apple inviting to the stage a VP from MICROSOFT. Early snowfall report in Hell!
Also, a new stylus: Apple Pencil. Measures location, force, and tilt of the pen. Recharges from the iPad's Lightning jack. Cool. #appleevent
The iPad Pro can be fitted with a new, magnetic iPad screen cover with physical keys. (*cough* Microsoft Surface idea *cough*) #appleevent
iPad Pro has 5.6 million pixels—more pixels than on the MacBook Pro with Retina screen. (I’d hate to be the guy who had to count them.)
Apple just unveiled the iPad Pro: Like the iPad, but bigger. 12.9” diagonal. Same width as the HEIGHT of the existing iPad. 1.8x faster.
Tim Cook showing off the new iPad Pro…
New Watches, now in silver aluminum and rose gold, and a stainless-steel "Product RED" model (red band). Nothing available in uranium yet.
Apple now unveiling a new line of Watches co-designed with Hermes, featuring very stylish leather bands, for very rich people.
Live demo of AirStrip, an Apple Watch app that shows output from medical devices. A mom can LISTEN to her baby's heartbeat via the watch.
Numbers Apple has revealed about the Watch: number of apps (10,000); customer satisfaction (97%). Not revealed: how many sold.
Tim Cook showing email from Dennis H: "I have lost 30 pounds with the Apple watch." (By taking off your Samsung Gear?)
