@WebBarr https://t.co/GR1Ro5hbQY
@WebBarr additional random netflix thought. was at a dinner with 6 guys last night and almost everyone brought up a netflix show that 3-4 people had never heard of. they're making so many shows that even a group of friends finds content rabbit holes on it that their friends arent aware of
@WebBarr and perhaps sptofiy is just at the same point netflix was when "all they did" was lease content until they grew big enough to make it themselves
@WebBarr true...but that necessity will drive a lot of innovation. i also wonder if there's a better value prop for Spotify &lt;&gt; Musicians vs Netflix &lt;&gt; Actors/Directors. I think i'd rather have the musicians - there's events and merch and lots of $ streams there
@WebBarr exactly. middle man death by internet. easiest bet ever
@WebBarr they'll figure it out id bet. too much power not too
WHen spotify started they had to pay top dollar and basically beg the labels to lease them their music. slowly that changed as the platform grew and the labels got revenue from it. Now (Darth Vader voice) the transformation is complete - and they're going to knock off the labels
also, h/t to my boy @WebBarr who always finds the good stuff.
I always used Spotify as the primary example of why Party as a Platform is the next transformation parties need to go thru - and this evolution is an obvious one, but a major sea change https://t.co/IUGS5G1J0j

Basic, 1.0-level, freshman year stuff like "custom audiences" "commercial data" or "direct response campaign" is 97% of the time completely unknown to even the reporters covering tech and advertising! Think of the scoops and insight they'd have if they took the time to learn.
All of that is unfortunately par for the course today. But what has continually surprised and disappointed me, however, is how unwilling many in the media are to dig in and become an expert in these fields - or at least surpass the low bar their peers have set.
Literally zero Senators and maybe 2 Congressman know *anything* about how those things work in a substantive way. And in my experience, maybe 2 or 3 journalists understand how data and advertising is used on modern campaigns.
What's most scary in life is, understandably, the unknown. The dark, what's under the bed, a first date. It is with this exact same fear of the unknown that Senators and the media discuss Facebook, advertising and "data".

To underline this lack of innovative thinking on TV - the biggest advancement shark tank has made in last 4-5 years is they ask a question on INsta stories for each segment if you'd invest or not. Plus they added slick white chairs last season. @mcuban
Either way, @ABCSharkTank is totally underperforming. And it's mostly because the MBAs who run TV think in broadcast, not 1-1. They literally cant conceive of a show becoming it's own network - much less an investment platform that revolutionizes startups.
creates a crypto coin that gains value because all the online subscribers gain access to the platform via a blockchain credential system (that needs polishing but work with me).
It's better than a bank because you also get access to the SharkTank Network Platform - a cottage industry of advisors/help/services. Maybe the Small Business Administration gets in the act and underwrites X% of the investment AND/OR
It's an entire investing culture that educates people, creates investors and has rankings based on experience or success (?). This also creates massive deal flow because this is where businesses can go to raise money in America now.
^^That's the Reddit side of it. The YCombinator side of it as an Everyman's YCombinator that invests in and cultivates entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship in AMerica. (replicate in other countries eventually). Not just tech but local products etc just like on the show now.
There are also regional and local online sharktanks where approved sharks (win a vote?) do the same as cuban/Mr Wonderful but at local level - again all covered in entirety online. Some of those move up to regional/national maybe like NCAA bball tourney.
Access to the main pitch stage in front of the sharks would also be voted on by this online community. they select who gets up there/have a large % vote. That's just the national setup.
True live TV social interaction. You dont get the youtube comments hell hole because paid subscribers=higher hurdle to jump to get in. Users could choose, if they wanted, to pool their money and also go in on the investment. Teams start to build their own brands.
This is sort of what Kickstarter is but this would be deeper and stronger: You get to watch the entire negotiation of the sharks and the entrepreneurs. LIVE. ongoing commentary and upvote/downvote from the subscribers could be incorporated into the shark's decision to invest.
Shark Tank is capable of being so much more. Specifically, it's own TV network. But it would really be a massive online community of paid subscribers masquerading as it's own "TV" network because it's real model is Reddit+YCombinator.
As long we're griping about NBC let's gripe about TV overall. Starting with how @ABCSharkTank is dropping the ball massively and how that's a microcosm of the big problems. Macro point: the MBAs running TV world think in broadcast when they live in a 1-1 world.

@jmartNYT understood - yes. very true. but level of "dems divided" stories/sentiment FAR lower w Pelosi's 60 no votes v GOP issues
@ltthompso appreciate that
10. While they meltdown, we have ~18 months to focus, fundraise, build, iron wrinkles and leapfrog them - again. #2020
9. So much so they didn’t even show up 2 the usually bipartisan digital recap event last night hosted by google. they couldnt face the music
8. ...until you get to 2016 and a decade of them believing their own digital/data press clips which they sold to a fawning press.
7. I would never trade spots with Dems on that. It weakens them every day.
6. Conclusion: the media's bias is the single greatest strength for the GOP and the single greatest weakness for the Dems.
5. Meanwhile Pelosi gets 60+ votes and they yawn.
4. We also had the media crushing us at every single opportunity. Boehner never opposed like Pelosi - they still said GOP in mass dissarray
3. Looking yourself in the eye and exposing your faults isn't easy. We did it and have had 2 huge cycles in a row.
2. What they need is to stop agonizing and start organizing. Which is precisely what the RNC/gop did after 2012.
1. If Dems want to convince themselves fake news lost them the election, I encourage them to dive into that rabbit hole.

4...all I could think was what could have been? If they'd been playing for last 25 years and put out another 3-4 albums.
3. Still it was sad. When Duff and Slash played Layla around the piano where Axl was playing b/f going into November Rain...
2. Slash makes them SO much better. sound is tighter yet looser at same time. Friend rightly said Chinese Democracy might've been gr8 w him
