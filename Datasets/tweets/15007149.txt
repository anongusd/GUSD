Ebola is back and the US needs to lead again to stop it. Many lessons from 2014. Proud to have written this with a partner who knows it cold - both as a doctor and as a leader at @seed_global and @MassGeneralNews - my daughter @vbkerry. https://t.co/xjGkF14f5I
Climate change is real, period - we don't need a panel to invent alternative facts. We must act NOW. Our planet and our grandchildren and beyond are relying on us.  https://t.co/xp1TCZc5OT
Very kind Amanda – thanks for sharing. And what a coincidence: I wrote him the same kind of letter! https://t.co/Eg3ew5oWB9
I’ve known @SenatorReid for thirty years: he’s too tough to care what @realDonaldTrump (or anyone) thinks - but the rest of us should be bothered that a president would ever say this about a Senate majority leader - who also passed historic legislation - regardless of party. https://t.co/I9teY0iHN0
Thanks for coming all the way to @Yale my friend! Was great to catch up and to reflect on our past efforts together. It was clear to the students how much you care about your country and the region. I wish we had time for me to treat you to @pepespizzeria - a New Haven tradition! https://t.co/DK6I84GhFd
Congrats to @RogerLau – he’s as loyal, creative, steady and capable as they come. Great leader for a team and a smart choice by @SenWarren – I was lucky to have him on my team and am proud of all he’s accomplished. https://t.co/7xdO8jByXP
I’ve known Frank Ricciardone for a long time –  he's a deeply respected diplomat and we should stand by him.
Sad to see this controversy. @AUC does the right thing to welcome any current or past SecState to speak. And we should all be glad they do - universities should expose students to different perspectives. And I say that as someone who disagreed with the content of the speech. https://t.co/zoSjNvsRDS
And it hurts the Senate in the long run. Far too many of our embassies around the globe have no ambassador  – it’s dangerous. 2/2
Not a partisan issue: I respect Senate prerogatives but hate seeing qualified career FSOs like Francisco Palmieri and Joe Macmanus blocked in the Senate without legitimate basis. They don't serve any political party. It hurts the @StateDept as institution. 1/2 https://t.co/37WJ3HRY0h
An important message about interfaith dialogue and bridge-building at the heart of this visit - it can benefit not just the region, but the work of diplomacy. Worth a read by all of us. https://t.co/1i6u1zHEkd
I hope The Back Channel will inspire a new generation of diplomats to follow Bill’s example the way Present at the Creation did for a different generation: he and Dean Acheson have more in common than just a great mustache! Pre-order today: https://t.co/nDDG8nruJc
Excited for everyone to have a chance to read Bill's memoir on March 12th. He's a legendary diplomat with important insights and incredible stories to share. https://t.co/2QhEXxFHrr
A reminder of all the good the folks that are the backbone of our government do behind the scenes while never seeking headlines. Also a sad reminder of Americans still imprisoned, including now another in Iran. Keep them all in our hearts, and in the efforts of public servants.
Seeing you and @YeganehSalehi reunited was one of the most moving and memorable moments of my time in public service. A true team effort – supported by dozens in the foreign and civil service. https://t.co/6Gkd9giSLm
The President of the United States just compared visiting our troops in a war zone to a "public relations event." Another sad day for our nation when that's how the Commander in Chief sees such a visit. https://t.co/I7F6jlJUBF
Instead of declaring a national emergency to address a fictional emergency – @realDonaldTrump needs to stop denying a real one: climate change. https://t.co/UYaG1mohwG
Pathetic that the president would defame a public servant who joined the Bush Administration and stayed on the last two years to help Iraq &amp; defeat ISIL. Demoralizing to public servants everywhere. @realDonaldTrump is not a fraction of the person or patriot that @brett_mcgurk is. https://t.co/VQJ3zq7Pgs
.@GovInslee  - no one knows how important this is more than you - and you’ve done an extraordinary job! Thanks for hosting me in Olympia earlier this year and for being a a pro moderator on my book tour! https://t.co/ORnMqPiq7R
Despicable. After so many - from George H.W. Bush to John McCain and Bill Clinton - worked for years to heal this open wound and put a war behind us - they’re turning their backs on people who fled and many who fought by our side. For what possible gain?https://t.co/fZC5O825OB
Way past the time for all of us to step up on climate - whether over, around, or in spite of @realDonaldTrump: https://t.co/Rm7Jb5PrMV
Embarrassing tweet from a President: not only is @realDonaldTrump in denial about climate change, he's delusional about France. Their citizens adamantly support the Paris Agreement and expect their leaders to do something about climate change. No one is chanting “We want Trump." https://t.co/YTh7h4CXjO
Congrats @AnneFinucane  - a leader on climate change, she's savvy and creative - and an incredible friend. She's earned this and more. https://t.co/IFdlPvYT3c
19 years ago today and none of us will ever forget. The Worcester Six were among the very best and bravest. God bless them and their families.

Teresa and I are thinking of the entire Bush family today. My thoughts on the passing of an exceptional American gentleman: https://t.co/7doJwJjXBT
The first lesson my wife Teresa taught me: you always want to be pro-condiment.	 But let's cut @MurielBowser some slack. Any day of the year we'd be grateful if the most controversial thing that other politician in DC said on social media was just about mumbo sauce... https://t.co/RrFydGYqlr
50 years. I was in Cam Ranh Cos Div 14 in 1968 when my mail arrived (on time!) and my mother had sent me the tape of the whole game. College seemed a world away, but that headline stung and still stings!! Harvard's 29-29 "win" over Yale still resonates https://t.co/buRr9HcG8L
Pretty sure a lot of people in Salem, MA would disagree.	Facts: your campaign manager was CONVICTED, Deputy Campaign Manager plead  guilty as did your National Security Advisor...and Robert Mueller was President Bush's head of the FBI and ran DoJ Criminal Division for Bush 41. https://t.co/wi07QvoFCg
.@realDonaldTrump is “in love” with Kim Jong Un but insults our oldest ally. Don’t expect him to know Lafayette but the Revolution wasn’t the only time France had our back: After 9/11, France sacrificed 88 brave soldiers in Afghanistan. Stop tweeting! America needs some friends. https://t.co/Usk9XfJovC
Thank you for your service @SenDuckworth - and for showing all of us how to live like every day is extra - because it is. https://t.co/7XGqAv0WRb
Happy Veterans Day, Greg. I’m glad that all of us who served in uniform fought to defend your freedom to be a complete fool on Twitter. #freedomisntfree https://t.co/LFUrXDWt8E
Important message from @DanCrenshawTX : “Never forget.” On Veterans Day we honor all who served - let’s do it the other 364 days too. To my brothers from PCF 44 and 94:  Every day is extra. Let’s always live that way. https://t.co/sjjXtwiEO3
President @realDonaldTrump a no-show because of raindrops? Those veterans the president didn’t bother to honor fought in the rain, in the mud, in the snow - &amp; many died in trenches for the cause of freedom. Rain didn’t stop them &amp; it shouldn’t have stopped an American president.
A reminder: Donald Trump didn’t just win because of those that voted for him – he won because millions didn’t cast a vote at all. Vote, and you may have disappointment - but you’ll never have regrets. Vote! Vote! Vote! https://t.co/oPa7igjlhk https://t.co/1ZCVf1X3wX
Hello from #OurOcean2018. Today, globally, too much money chases too few fish with too little protection. For Fishing to remain a way of life, we must make it sustainable - and @juliepackard @MontereyAq and I have teamed up to show we can: https://t.co/n6C5zs7FKe
Glad to be in Bali for #OurOceans2018 : @David_Cameron and I working with @pewenvironment @Bertarelli_fdn as Pew Bertarelli Ocean Ambassadors. Read our op-ed in @USATODAY. A man-made crisis that we can and must solve: https://t.co/UgiXoCfaw6
Want to make sure the young people in your life vote on Election Day? Here's some added motivation (not that my daughters worry about anything I say on twitter!) - have them sign #TheBigDeal2018 pledge so their voices will be heard loud/clear on Nov 6th: https://t.co/pUhCK0VUhI
Two weeks until Election Day and young people will decide this election. In the last midterms, less than 20% of Americans 18-29 voted. That made Mitch McConnell Majority Leader. Now that “professor” is on my resume, I'm proud to sign the #EducatorPledge: https://t.co/uNqWurXesa
Yes, Sean! My friend from the trail in '04 -  glad you're all in on this. The IPCC report is all the reminder required that we need all the activism we can find. A crisis no one can lie, deny, or hide their way out of - and your voice matters. https://t.co/N9RHL3Ui9N
I appreciate the kind words! It's more rewarding than you know to hear that your example made a difference. Pursue that dream - the Foreign Service needs that next great generation. Maybe we'll be calling you Madam Ambassador one day! https://t.co/TrngoTBDFA
To anyone in despair: with your help, a #bluewave of vets are about to hit Congress and teach @realDonaldTrump that patriotism isn't dividing your fellow Americans, it's bringing them together in service to country. Be sure to register to vote &amp; then help @votevets GOTV on Nov 6! https://t.co/Kp3Apj7NEQ

Big thanks to @VanityFair for including me on their list of the top 8 books to read this Fall!  Now there’s finally an answer to the age-old SAT question: “What do John Kerry, Omarosa, and Ken Starr have in common?” https://t.co/8tEuxtKw7M
Politics as Usual a great way to pass the time in traffic or on the T – but only after you’ve finished Every Day Is Extra on @audible_com first!
Congrats to @MichaelDSheehan on his new pod, Politics as Usual: https://t.co/3TBUJ40g7R. Michael’s smart, creative, and has had a bird’s eye view of Dem presidential debate prep forever – including my debates in 2004. Michael knows the backstory behind this pic from 2012 too. https://t.co/V7iaqoCBQi
Siobhan, thank you! Means a lot. We all fight on - and that's what the book is about: you get knocked down, you get up. Thanks for listening and give it a read! https://t.co/5jy0uixN0m
Lots of memories in EDIE - it was hard to choose the photos.  A #tbt outtake: me and "The Boss" @springsteen - in 2004.  Read an excerpt below about Bruce on the trail, and buy to read the never before told story of how he bucked me up after I lost: https://t.co/n7Nu03Yk4F https://t.co/QZpnH73loY
Thanks @crookedmedia for the great talk about Every Day Is Extra (https://t.co/n7Nu03Yk4F). Fun to catch up with @jonfavs – hell of a journey Jon's had from interning with me to White House star to podcast phenomenon. Next up – Favs 2028? And hi to @TVietor08 - go Pats! https://t.co/WS4Tcaom2s
Thanks to you all, Every Day Is Extra has hit the @nytimesbooks bestseller list two weeks in a row! I'm grateful to everyone who is reading my story - and it's never too late to start!  https://t.co/n7Nu03Yk4F
My first "Forrest Gump" moment, albeit dressed like Greg from Animal House. Read the full story of how I ended up in this shot in the first chapter of Every Day Is Extra: https://t.co/fclot0hg2a https://t.co/UDkk41rgip
PS - I recorded the audio version, not Omarosa.
Mr. President, you should be more worried about Paul Manafort meeting with Robert Mueller than me meeting with Iran's FM. But if you want to learn something about the nuclear agreement that made the world safer, buy my new book, Every Day Is Extra: https://t.co/DKjc33Kvvu https://t.co/cesltkt0zW
Honored that Every Day Is Extra debuted on the @nytimesbooks best seller list - a big thank you to everyone that bought a copy and to everyone that's come out to an event. More dates have been added to https://t.co/lpFSGhpidH  - hope to see you out there! https://t.co/fpA2hPHUlr
Congrats, Martin! Washington will miss you, but @CFR_org knows what they're getting: one of the best in the business – and a quality of character that we are all lucky to know. Be well, my friend. https://t.co/TI3Ckpfxn4
Thank you @GovInslee for the  great talk and more importantly for your extraordinary leadership. President Trump may have pulled out of Paris, but governors and mayors are still in. Thanks for all you do to protect our planet – keep it up! https://t.co/lAAFFU5S4g
Really enjoyed my talk with @hughhewitt today – tough, thoughtful questions – all fair ones.  Good to get to know each other across the divide. Hugh called my book “a must read” so on that we are united!  Who says the right and the left can’t find common ground? https://t.co/MSMxPLnSry
Really glad to see two friends - both incredible advocates for our planet - @AnneFinucane &amp; @Anne_Hidalgo - teaming up for this critical op-ed. Washington may be falling behind, but business and the world have stepped up to the plate. An important read. https://t.co/sHv2DerhIP
Thanks, Molly - but Teresa assures me it's been four score and seven years since anyone used the word 'hot' to describe this mug. https://t.co/C0BahsBgXp
Had a great time on @TheView this morning. We shared some special memories of John McCain and were all thinking of @MeghanMcCain who does him proud. This photo captures the moment I realized maybe I should have picked @WhoopiGoldberg as my VP in 2004. @JoyVBehar as SecState? https://t.co/p3GuJH8vA5
Grateful for a terrific conversation with Rachel @maddow - one of the smartest and most sincere people in the business. Amazing Iran Contra footage she dug up from 1987. Hope she takes me up on the "Rachel Recommends!" book club! Our interview here: https://t.co/YyCzWdhmXx https://t.co/MGpp49IF0H
And thank you @mikecapuano for your decades of service to our nation and to Massachusetts: a liberal force and I’m grateful for your friendship. A campaign between two great people.
Congratulations @AyannaPressley. Couldn’t be more proud of you and can’t help but imagine the smile on Mama Pressley's face watching you from heaven. She’s beaming.
Thank you @ShribmanPG for a thoughtful review. As editor of the @BostonGlobe before you left for Teresa’s favorite city, you were always a candid and tough observer - so this means all the more. Honored you took on this return assignment! https://t.co/nBkMi9nnAS
Publication day for Every Day Is Extra is here! In bookstores now. It's more than a story about my journey, it’s a story of how America has overcome changes and challenges and the people and everyday citizens who got us through tough times. https://t.co/kI8vYEYN5x

I traveled to 91 countries as Secretary of State: believe me, the places where the press is under assault are the places where other freedoms are in jeopardy too. Never take it for granted. #FreePress
A must-read project from the @BostonGlobe and editorial boards around the nation. An attack on our press is an attack on our constitution and our country. https://t.co/lJ7xZiQqEC
@NasserJudeh @SimonBooks Thank you! And I'm looking forward to hearing what you think!
This is putting personal petty politics ahead of patriotism and national security, end of story. You expect this banana republic behavior in the kind of countries that the State Department warns Americans not to travel to, but not at home in the USA. https://t.co/5f0pVSuHnd
@JanKEliasson Thank you, my friend! Look forward to hearing your thoughts!
Both my granddaughter and Ben the Diplomutt are excited for my new book, Every Day Is Extra. She wants to read it, Ben wants to chew it into pieces, and both are wondering "what the hell happened to the young guy on the cover?" https://t.co/Lz11XaPPYV
Climate change is devastating coral reefs around the globe and New Caledonia is taking a stand by protecting some of the healthiest and intact reefs on Earth. Thank you, @GouvNC! I look forward to more announcements establishing similar protections in October @OurOcean2018.
Disgraceful - but nothing will erase for an instant the legacy John McCain has written and is still writing every day. https://t.co/hv40tsnqo3
Pres. Nixon resigned 44 years ago. Hard to convey those days, the sense that the country was coming apart. Thought the era of “enemies lists” was safely behind us! But a lesson from then that makes me an optimist today: we fought back and we changed the congress and the country. https://t.co/jRzLqXQozZ

Really important to see Facebook’s vigilance. It’s vital and a reminder that we’ve seen online attacks by Russia in the last few weeks against @clairecmc and @JeanneShaheen - confirms @ODNIgov Coats is right about ‘blinking warning’ light. https://t.co/L5kcMy5tvc
Wishing @SteveMullUSA all good things in his next adventure. I was privileged to know Amb. Mull when he served as both Amb to Poland and JCPOA Coordinator. A professional to the core and one of the best diplomats of his generation. Thank you for a lifetime of service. https://t.co/I5cnadDc4N
Looking forward to reading Valerie’s story — she has a lot of wisdom and insights to share. https://t.co/n8LrM5hj9B

My thoughts on President Trump's remarks in Brussels this morning: https://t.co/x0k3k0lOkA
Not surprisingly, The Boss says it best. This isn’t who we are, or who we should ever risk becoming - and fixing it shouldn’t take an executive order. https://t.co/VXWoaPXAoX

Cancer is an evil foe - but Harry has more than our well-wishes in his corner going for him - he's got family and faith, and a lot of love around him.
Thinking of @SenatorReid - the fourth and final Leader with whom I served in the Senate - and one of the toughest, most tenacious people I knew in government and in life. Searchlight made Harry resilient, and every time the odds are long, Harry Reid comes through.
Actually Jeff, you’re too kind. There are words - four letter ones. If @SenJohnMcCain and I didn’t know how to use them before the Navy, we became fluent in them then. And they all apply to anyone who would say anything like that about John or any family battling cancer. https://t.co/oJ9A3YDkNL
My thoughts on President Trump’s Iran statement: https://t.co/E5A12PKnnx
These comments are wrong, ugly, and unacceptable - anywhere from anyone - but particularly from anyone who says he wants to be a peacemaker. No excuses for antisemitism: words to be condemned, not explained away. https://t.co/BDnsiWEVVt
There was no negotiation - and all of that changed with JCPOA. Blow up the deal and you're back there tomorrow! 4/4
It’s worth remembering that the early 2000's  - when his evidence comes from - was the period where the world had no visibility into Iran’s program. More and more centrifuges were spinning each month and the world wasn’t united like it is now: https://t.co/nvINFYDOdc 3/4
Read their unprecedented letter in its entirety here: https://t.co/8NABgACTLW. Everything that PM Netanyahu laid out was exactly why we needed this agreement. 2/4
Every detail PM Netanyahu presented yesterday was every reason the world came together to apply years of sanctions and negotiate the Iran nuclear agreement - because the threat was real and had to be stopped. It's working! That’s why Israeli security experts are speaking out. 1/4
Something I've never done before - and I'm not done writing - but it's been an interesting exercise looking back on life &amp; lessons while still fighting: My memoir, “Every Day is Extra,” will be published by @SimonBooks on September 4th.

The police that Republicans love to give speeches praising support the assault weapons ban and I'd stand with them and our students any day over politicians who ignore common sense, period. #StudentsStandUp
Getting rid of assault weapons and strengthening background checks doesn't take anything away from the 2nd Amendment and doesn't hurt a single hunter. However, it does reduces the # of massacres in our schools. Isn't that reason enough?
Fed up that more than 13 years since the @GOP Congress let the assault weapons ban expire, we still can't settle a pretty simple debate: that weapons of war have no place on the streets of America. Why is this difficult?
Nice to be back in “the real Washington” where good things are actually happening to responsibly deal w/climate change. Thank you @GovInslee for all you’re doing &amp; for letting me pitch in. The administration may have pulled out of Paris but you &amp; the American people are still in! https://t.co/UwqmenOJux

The Nunes memo is dangerous, ugly, and an assault on the integrity of the institutions of our country. I lived through Watergate/Nixon: America pays a very steep price when a political party tries to undermine the institutions that hold us together -

With humility about how little we know about what's happening inside Iran, this much is clear: it's an Iranian moment and not anyone else's. But the rights of people to protest peacefully and voice their aspirations are universal and governments everywhere should respect that.

@POTUS 3. @potus has been tougher naming/shaming an American CEO and Senate Majority Leader than a domestic terrorist who took an American life.
@POTUS 2. @potus empowered the worst of the worst to hear exactly what they wanted to hear.
1.No matter what @potus says now-first instincts always revealing; his was to look into the camera and say "many sides"-that cant be erased.
2) The United States condemns it overseas and needs to start to do same at home.
1) What we've seen today in #Charlottesville needs to be condemned and called what it is: hatred, evil, racism &amp; homegrown extremism.

@POTUS 5) Instead, this is just conjuring up fake excuses to discriminate/distract. We’re better than this.
@POTUS 4) Nor is this decision in line with America's traditional role setting standard for other countries to treat people with dignity.
@POTUS 3) Nothing about today’s announcement is in line with our nation’s values.
2) Harry Truman didn't break down barriers with an executive order just to have @POTUS try and build them back up via a tweet.
1) America has always been strongest when we find a place for everyone willing to lay down their life to serve.

More change than ever before-short and long term. Wanted to share a few thoughts on how we got here and where we go. https://t.co/4MXDJhq0RZ
Cut me some slack on "threading." To paraphrase Yoda: "Tweet this well when 73 you are I doubt."
9- Must also consider how to make any move in coordination/consultation with our European allies, who were and are essential.
8- We need to consider the implications of confrontation without conversation.
7- There are many tools to up the pressure already in place and at our disposal. We need to weigh/consider risk to JCPOA.
6- After Rouhani’s reelection, there is much up in the air/room for misinterpretation. This is not the moment for a new Iran bill.
5- But to my friends &amp; former colleagues, here is my take: this is a time to tread carefully.
4- On #JCPOA, we engaged in an important back and forth. And I welcomed that debate.
3- #SFRC has made constructive contributions over years, both sanctions + exploring Iran nuclear issue substantively.
2- Tomorrow, #SFRC is considering the Iran bill. Big decision. I respect SFRC's prerogatives - I spent 28 years there myself.
1- My first "tweet storm."  What recovering Senator could be constrained by 140 characters?! #Fillibuster habits die hard.
Home in MA &amp; lucky to speak with @Kennedy_School graduates today. I promise to keep it short! Watch live at 2pm. https://t.co/GrnKOz53vp
@LindseyGrahamSC and I do not always agree - but he is spot on here. https://t.co/q9HphkdMPy
3) Murdering children the ultimate act of cowardice. The whole world must find answers and act so that this does not become the new normal.
2) Moms/Dads: imagine dropping off your kids at concert, later turning on the TV and fearing whether it's your son or daughter lost.
1) Prayers, yes, but need more than that for all of our friends in Manchester/UK.

Naming #Daesh's crimes is important—but what is essential is unity to stop them. U.S. will continue to lead global effort to defeat Daesh.
We must hold Daesh accountable.  And we must help those harmed by these atrocities to survive in their ancestral land.
#Daesh also responsible for crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing directed at these groups as well as Sunnis, Kurds, other minorities.
It is my judgment that #Daesh is responsible for genocide against groups in areas it controls, including Yazidis, Christians, Shia.

This is not the way modern nations resolve problems. There is still a right set of options. Not invasion. @FaceTheNation
We're going to continue to engage diplomatically. It's the time for diplomacy. Nobody wants this to spiral in a worse direction.
This can be resolved according to the standard of the 21st century. @FaceTheNation
Invasion is not the act of someone who is strong. It is the act of someone who is weak. @FaceTheNation
President Obama made it clear we are prepared to work with #Russia to help people of #Ukraine. There are many alternatives to invasion.
Unified view by G8 &amp; more that they will not engage with #Russia as business as normal. Russia inviting trade isolation. @meetthepress
This is not East-West, #US &amp; Europe versus #Russia. This is about people of #Ukraine fighting against tyranny. @ThisWeekABC
There are many options available to #Russia. Pres. Putin needs to think about Russia's interests. There will be costs to military action.
