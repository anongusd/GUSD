Studies underway to study effectiveness of green tools to treat runoff. http://t.co/LPfEYeGUNm #MonsterJam
Studies showed bioretention of toxic runoff reduced mortality in fish and inverts, prevents heart defects in fish embryos #MonsterJam
Dr. McIntyre: Green stormwater infrastructure effective at reducing PAHs and metals #monsterjam
Dr. McIntyre: Contaminants in stormwater runoff affect cardiac function in fish studies. #MonsterJam
Dr. McIntyre: PAH levels in stormwater were found to be sufficient to cause sublethal toxicity in fish #MonsterJam
Dr. McIntyre: are metals in highway runoff neurotoxic to fish? Surprisingly, no. #MonsterJam
Dr. Jen McIntyre: studies showed runoff collected from storm events acutely lethal to invertebrates (mortality within 48 hours) #MonsterJam
"First flush" of urban runoff collected from highway near NWFSC lab found to have dissolved zinc and copper and PAHs.  #MonsterJam
Urban runoff is toxic to coho salmon embryos, too. 75% of embryos abnormal or died in experiments http://t.co/xDj0YdkOec.
Pre spawning adult mortality in coho salmon tied to amount of impervious surface and land use. http://t.co/MOGfRbcRjF #MonsterJam
Coho salmon vulnerable to toxic stormwater. Pre spawn mortality found in adults in Seattle's urban creeks http://t.co/MOGfRbcRjF #MonsterJam
Why do we need green stormwater infrastructure? Because Puget Sound is not a forest. #MonsterJam
Green stormwater infrastructure = a "sponge" that gives stormwater a place to go.  #MonsterJam
