@FactsOfSchool I have heard med school is even worse. People say it is like being inside a black whole. Time just breaks down at that point.
I really love this soundtrack. Is it going to be on vinyl? https://t.co/Vul2ipgUUV
@darcie2000 if you are the person(s) who put together the soundtrack for #TEOTFW on #Spotify thank you so much. It really is perfect.
@elisabusrah found your playlist on Spotify. The one with the Uber long title. It‚Äôs a good selection.

I wish people would be more direct in their feelings for others. I like to hear it from ‚Äúthe Horse‚Äôs mouth‚Äù so to speak. Whatever happened to being open and honest? I always respected someone who spoke how they truly felt and didn‚Äôt have their friends or family act as go-betweens

@RileyJayDennis It‚Äôs just baiting. Guys like it too.

@grimalkinrn I truly sympathize with your story and having to advocate for patients who are overlooked due to racial bias. However, the amount of typos in this story makes me question your attention to detail. You may have been very tired while writing this so I‚Äôll keep that in mind.

@Failtext Sure. I don‚Äôt care how you word it. Well, I kind of do. But in this case I see it as an honor to be called ‚Äúnigga‚Äù (term of endearment and brotherhood) even though I am white. I would feel like the ‚Äútoken‚Äù white boy that everyone respected.
@g1alfonso @zerohedge Yup.
@TheKnowledge I really like this quote. Thanks.
@RileyJayDennis You helped me to learn just a little more today. I was not familiar with the term ‚Äúnon-binary‚Äù with regards to gender identity. I‚Äôm going through a period of feeling asexual myself. Thanks for sharing your story.

It is all BS. Why don‚Äôt we stop using the FPS-R scale and start using more objective criteria. Ex: on a scale of 0-childbirth rate your pain. Our experiences of pain could be used as a dataset and then find means and standard deviations. Let‚Äôs get more objective.
@susancain This article is wrong on simple facts and even has typos in it. I swear people write crap articles just to see who they can piss off. I couldn‚Äôt even finish it.

@JanetYellenBlog Is it wrong that I want to see the markets tank and watch crypto currency take off?

@MichaelLaBrie Now that is the truth.
@EmmyMaher I don‚Äôt feel like a sex machine. Wish I did. The country I live in has made me feel asexual. I want to move to Canada or Ireland. The USA is just turning into a bunch of whining bitches.

@chronicpainwar @marwilliamson Also, this graph may show a more insidious problem. Opioid prescriptions are declining and deaths are increasing. This suggest that people are getting drugs from sources such as the dark web or unverified dealers. What is certain is better communication is needed.
@chronicpainwar @marwilliamson Statistics can be misleading. It says deaths due to ‚Äúopioid prescriptions‚Äù is decreasing. Opioids may still be ‚Äúoverprescribed‚Äù even though prescriptions are on the decline. Example: people who transition to street drugs such as heroin because it is cheaper.

@TEOTFW Just binged watched the first season. There has to be a second season. This is the most lifelike couple I have watched on screen. (Besides the sociopathic part). It shows how twisted love can be and what people will do to protect the ones they love.
