What are constituents hearing when they call Congress?  üëáüëáüëá		https://t.co/wQXZN6Ssfl 		With https://t.co/jmMC6ZgyTb smart voicemail, this never ever happens.  #congress #govtech #ShutdownStories
@jacalata @civicdesign @twilio @TwilioDotOrg @IntranetQuorum @Fireside21 @OpenGovFdn @senatemajldr The Senate does not allow Senators to use Article One. Their old fashioned VM boxes are capped at a mere 300 messages. We‚Äôre ready &amp; able to fix this for @senatemajldr and all Senators‚Äîeven better, the first month of Article One smart voicemail will be on us!
When snow shuts down Congress, https://t.co/jmMC6ZgyTb smart voicemail ensures every constituent is still heard.  Staffers can handle everything from the comfort and safety of home.  #sNOwDaysOff #govtech https://t.co/tXnlmHHYzA
Did you know 20% of the US House‚Äôs voicemail boxes were full and rejecting constituent callers over the past five days? 87 out of 441 Representatives!		But with https://t.co/jmMC6ZgyTb‚Äôs unlimited capacity, no one‚Äôs voice is ever silenced by a full VM box.üëá

@JakeInSF @WaltHickey That‚Äôs before we talk about laughably low VM storage. This has a lot more of the story: https://t.co/C0XrNYBHaq.  Article One allows way MORE constituent voices to be received &amp; responded to. Everyone deserves to be heard no matter the channel. Today, that‚Äôs far from the case.
@JakeInSF @WaltHickey Thanks, Jake &amp; Walter. The reality is virtually all VMs get conveniently deleted without anyone logging them, let alone responding. Worse, virtually all ‚Äúlow effort‚Äù communications (advocacy calls, emails, petitions, social media, etc) are never seen, logged or responded to 1/2
@shimown We looked into this for you. The .one domain is new, and it is likely your company network hasn‚Äôt been updated to allow newer domains. But your network administrator would know more. Thanks for letting us know and enjoy the rest of the day.
