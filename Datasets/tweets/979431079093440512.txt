@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump What kind of leader are you. A fear monger, lying with suppositions founded on no proof. You represent the lowest common denominator in our society. I pray your heart and actions change. I would hate to know you must stand before the white throne if judgement. Known by our fruits

@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Amen @charliekirk11 keep spreading the word! You are reaching so many more than me!
@davidaxelrod @POTUS How many expected anything less from a leader of the wimpy Obamass administration. You prove intelligent people right every time you open your mouth @davidaxelrod !
@catturd2 He took all the demands of @SpeakerPelosi  and placed them back in her court. Let’s see if she will eat her crow and finally do her job!
@SteveGuest He just proves what we already knew. The Joker is a SWAMP CREATURE. George Washington would be so sad this is how his state is represented
@realDonaldTrump PLEASE DON’T GIVE IN ON THE WALL!
Christopher Wray is such a wimpy FBI Director. Get rid of him, why do FBI agents have to bust into the  home of a 70 year old man and his wife to enforce a warrant! What stupid leadership!

@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump I still want government assessment of these positions for possible elimination. Backpay them, provide severance packages and ELIMINATE the useless positions. Has anyone truly been greatly unconvinced by this partial shutdown? BE HONEST AND REALLY THINK ABOUT IT
@nytimes And I would read a suggestion from the degenerate NYT staff. Make me laugh harder😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
@MeghanMcCain @JoeBiden And the liar, plagiarist continuesto speak ( out of both sides of the mouth)
@newtgingrich Correct @newtgingrich as Article 2 Section 3 states and I believe @realDonaldTrump should not have declared @SpeakerPelosi the winner. She does not dictate the state of the union. He should GIVE THE SPEECH!
Read the Constitution, @SpeakerPelosi does not have the final say. The Executive can call the body to order to present things he feels important. Also he can suspend the body as written in Article 2 Section 3. Read it democrats. Call the session! https://t.co/J9266c46sQ #FoxNews

@petluvers4Trump @RashidaTlaib @POTUS This is nothing more than the perfect example of what the democrat party has become. Shame on @SpeakerPelosi for acting as if nothing is wrong with the filth. This is a prime example of how radical Islam is. Read the Koran if you want to see HATE personified
I’m with you there. I would like to see all the sweet government contracts @SpeakerPelosi and family have sucked in as well as the millionaire status for @harryreid2016 let’s see their taxes since they were elected and see the rise in their wealth https://t.co/41Hv9it935
I think we should look at Apple under Tim Cook, a bad CEO who has survived on the success of Steve Jobs https://t.co/vZBzT7CkoM
@SenMikeLee @MittRomney @SenMikeLee you can have him. You are both two wimpy peas in a pod.
@ByronYork @GreenvilleNews As a South Carolinian glad he is home. He was a very big disappointment on every investigation he chaired
@freedom_moates I know he falls into the dumb and dumber category
@RonWyden @realDonaldTrump Because it is none of our damn business
@davidaxelrod God save us. Pray for America
@freedom_moates One more moron with power. @NancyPelosi is nothing more than a socialist ideologue like  Maduro in Venezuela who will make it up as they go!
@paulkrugman @paulkrugman you are definitely the pot calling the kettle black. Fake, phony
@paulkrugman No some people have a limited knowledge. It was a complete government piece of socialist crap invading the private sector. Get out and read and research and stop listening to @paulkrugman what a journalistic joke
@BuckSexton Yes when dust settles ALL democrats fall into the socialist bucket. Republicans don’t settle into anything with a consistent majority. Thanks to the over zealous compromise wing called RINOs. Mitt is a founding member along with his late father.
@RealJamesWoods I want an investigation into this supposed link of pencil neck @RepAdamSchiff and a pedophile ring of prominent people
@JeffFlake And there you have it....one Flake complimenting another flake!
@w_terrence God bless in the coming year @w_terrence
Well said, he shows a small stature and pettiness to the office. He is not an Orrin Hatch for sure https://t.co/xdrREdeR66
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Don’t you mean #UsethePeople, I believe that is a much more accurate description of Democrat Party politics. It certainly is NOT statesmanship
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump He offered a plan you moron @NancyPelosi    You were all for a wall and voted for it when Obamass was in the WH. Admit it you are prejudiced.
Happy New Year everyone. I wish you a full and blessed 2019
@realDonaldTrump Democrats are proven flip flopping bold faced liars. Use confiscated drug money, tell Lyin’ Nancy and  Cryin’ Chuck to stick it and fund the entire 25 billion. GET ‘ER DONE @@realDonaldTrump
@BreitbartNews This kind of elected official proves Montana would get more sane voters if they let all the sheep in the state vote!
@chuckwoolery Didn’t Weird Al Gore predict by now we would already be under water dome 15 plus years ago. What alarmist liars
@davidaxelrod @POTUS @davidaxelrod your vapid response to everything not meeting you socialist agenda or about Donald Trump is very tiresome. I am responding so you will continue to think someone gives a damn
@davidaxelrod @HeartlandCafe @BarackObama All good communists must fade away
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Neither did the pompous ass in the White House you eorked for but he had no success but a lot of concessions.
@JudicialWatch @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump We can only PRAY
@JetSetGuy82 @ConlonTisch @DameJEMarshall @SenBooker @FBI Great! So true and to the point. I love it

@BreitbartNews @NancyPelosi She is not worth any comment

@Montel_Williams @realDonaldTrump Very simplistic and untruthful statement, BUT what do you expect from whinnying liberal socialists. They are like the Everready battery. THEY JUST KEEP ON LYING

@RealTT2020 @GShapiro9News @9NEWS After listening to his comments.                  1. All facts are not ALL out I will agree         2. Still sounds like a “journalist” who gets the the daily talking points memo from the DNC though
@realDonaldTrump Merry Christmas to you and all the First Family. God bless you all.

@charliekirk11 @PJS18463750 Amen @charliekirk11 think how great the world would be if only half of the population let it be their life’s guide
@BreitbartNews What a two face jacka**s. You served under wimpy Obamass and never shouted when he pulled troops from the region and created the birth of ISIS! What a phony
@BartHubbuch @RichardGrenell This is the filth that billows from leftist. It always comes down to a personal attack because they have no substance for civil discourse. Probably a lack of intelligence to know what that even means!
@JeffFlake That is the absolute issue @JeffFlake the Federal Reserve has NEVER benn independent. Goodbye one less incompetent boob out of DC

@ChuckCallesto @PJS18463750 It was pointed out many times how petty and vindictive McCain could be...I am often thankful he was not elected president for various reasons. God either intervenes or allows things to happen..I trust in the Lord

@MammaLon @kcevans56 @realDonaldTrump I am not turning. Never that, but I will always give my reasons for any correction to policy I feel is going astray. Do not give in on this spending bill. Piss on a feckless Congress. FUND THE WALL! SHUT IT DOWN!  NO retro pay either. I don’t get free paid days off.
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump What BS, now you socialist democrats are in favor of war! Do you really know how two-faced you are @davidaxelrod  That is part of the reason we rejected the policies of Obamass! We are you for what you really are: TRAITORS OF THE AMERICAN DREAM!
@Jim_Jordan AMEN @Jim_Jordan the American people have had enough compromising us into oblivion. That is why we rose up to elect @realDonaldTrump in 2016. Drop the ball on national security and there will be a massive response in 2020. FUND THE WALL!  Pray for our leaders to show leadership!

@hughhewitt @brithume @realDonaldTrump I must agree. I don’t like the language used by @realDonaldTrump since this is an open invitation for aggressive behavior. Tell Putin to stick it. DO NOT FREELY GIVE THEM ANOTHER FOOTHOLD IN THE REGION!

@SecretAgentQ1 Wonder how the media would report this if a vehicle his the road obstacle in the Butt
The Vatican states a jihadist was prevented from bombing Vatican City on Christmas. The Pope is so in favor of mass immigration and favorable to Muslim extremist; maybe a taste of terrorism on his home turf like NYC experienced would provide some sanity to his rants. Not in favor

@xolexieox @Dogs_Daze Is @RepAdamSchiff working to cover up all his involvement with these people and Standard Hotels?
@Jenn198523 @GDujanovic So very sad. Not to mention disgusting. She she should be censured the moment she takes the oath of office for conduct unbecoming of a member of the House

@DineshDSouza @lizsportster @weeklystandard I’ll bet you @BillKristol hands are so soft you would think it is a baby’s butt. He will become a talking head on some liberal outlet like Rodman Gergen did.

@BreitbartNews I can’t decide if this man is actually this stupid or just wants to do anything to keep his name in the news
@englemanmike1 @AReebel I truly believe @RepAdamSchiff does not want a light shown on his private life or the personal corruption of his life both private and public
@mitchellvii @AReebel Amen, and remember it was @NancyPelosi who stupidly said “ we have to pass the bill to see what is in it”.
@marklutchman @adarpe Remember the god of this age blinds even those you consider intelligent to common sense and the truth..Pray for those spouting the hate and lies but most importantly pray for those being sucked into believing the garbage. “Judgement is mine saith the Lord”.

@Jamierodr10 @mike42586 @realDonaldTrump Amazing anyone in the mainstream media covered this event. Thank you @realDonaldTrump for all you do. Merry Christmas. Your administration is always in my prayers
@RealTT2020 @bpQGcO0sfGFK594 Facts democrats do not want anyone to hear
@PressSec @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Merry Christmas to one of the best press secretaries ever.  What a beautiful couple. God bless you both
@charliekirk11 The sad thing is it was 8 years that did more damage to race relations in this nation all the way back to segregation. We must work to fight the race based politics of democrats everywhere we can. This would truly erase the Obamass legacy.
@MeghanMcCain And we do best by celebrating the TRUE meaning of Christmas, the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Merry Christmas to all. Spread the love of Jesus to all!
@SarahPalinUSA Robert Francis sounds just like the RKF of the 60’s. Big fat socialist.
@davidaxelrod @POTUS And the great Obamass said in the beginning 50 million Americans would get coverage. That was such a lie it is not even 20  million
@winstonCovfefe Use common sense. What @newtgingrich is saying is not without merit. This is a fanatical following that is in opposition to everything America is founded upon. Our entire way of life is threatened. Pray for them because they are a lost people.

@RebekahWorsham @JeffFlake I am doing the “Happy Dance”
@EricHolder I don’t think @EricHolder the only Attorney General EVER charged with Contempt of Congress provides a good example for what is right. Your credibility is on very shaky ground.
Pray for the Lord to aid our president to continue to overcome all those against him. Pray the Lord keeps @realDonaldTrump on focus and doing what is right for our nation and God’s glory
Remember my sane fellow Americans who believe in and cheer on our president. Don’t let the fake media and democrats shake your support. If you are listening to their lies I urge you to fact check and dig deeper to expose their biases. STAY STRONG IN YOUR SUPPORT OF DJT!
@realDonaldTrump Way to go @realDonaldTrump. People wake up and see that our President is working this like a pro! DJT is right on the money! MAGA now
@chuckwoolery I hope democrats are about to paint themselves into an inescapable corner over border security so that EVERYONE can see their fake concern. It is all about votes and illegals voting for democrats
@ScottPresler @PJS18463750 @thegayrepub1998 The silent majority truly spoke in 2016 for @realDonaldTrump and we must do it in 2020 and bring more of the House and Senate along too. Politics really is LOCAL
@MurphDaSurf1956 @BreitbartNews Sadly this is more true than anyone wants to admit

@pnjaban I would add good riddance to bad rubbish.
@PoliticalShort Yes it is time for @JeffFlake to just flake off. Best to you in your new adventures. My prayers are that you learn a valuable lesson. This is not the age of McCain-type leaders. Retire from politics you were never in the statesman category any way.
What is all this I am hearing about shifty Adam Schiff paying $16 thousand to a 19 year old for silence about a sexual misconduct charge?

@w_terrence Right there with you brother
@juliepie76 @AReebel I lost mine last year at the end on November. I feel what you are going through. I miss so much just being able to chat with him. I miss his prayers because I know he lifted me up every day.
@AwakeToday @auntmushy When it is shut down this time tell the Democrat leadership there will be no retro pay to federal employees this time. See how fast they come to agreement when the federal labor union members start calling democrats offices demanding them to end the shutdown
@mpg25mary @NancyPelosi Amen
@RealKyleMorris @tomborelli Amen @RealKyleMorris do they really know how they sound. Very frightening. You can tell he is from wacko California
@g_e_anderson @morningmika I don’t watch leftists propaganda since you are not a journalist so I would not know if you were big enough to apologize

@DanielTurnerPTF I believe he said it best when he told the dumbo Nancy but this was transparency. I believe it made her look like a liar that she really is, very sad. Pray America this is the leader of the next US House
@GovMikeHuckabee He is like the wimpy kid in the sandbox who did not get his way
@YellowRose1776 @lilibellmia @morningmika @MSNBC @parscale @PressSec @SecPompeo Because “the god of this age” (satan) is running rampant and drawing soldiers in positions of influence to further his dream of keeping as many from Salvation as possible.
What is happening, if I refer to G*d in a teeet it is automatically removed. Social media does discriminate. They are liars when they deny
@LNW4Trump @MazurikL God warns us to not add or distract from the Holy Scriptures
If @NancyPelosi told the president to pray for biblical wisdom; I believe she should try “politician heal thyself”! I pray for my enemies like Nancy as the fruit she bears shows nothing of Gods law or goodness.
@gradeApnutbutr @NancyPelosi And we gave one more automaton for the pile
@SteveWa33264659 Thanks Steve, I need to add we should continue to pray for the Lord’s guidance and power
@lilibellmia @realDonaldTrump I love the dumbfounded look on Nancy. DJT really got them, I believe Dumbsy and Crying Chuck were completely surprised by the firm stance of our great President
@Jim_Jordan FUND THAT ENTIRE WALL!!!! BUILD THAT WALL!!!!!!

@BreitbartNews Nancy doesn’t want to publicly admit they DO NOT want border security at all
@NancyPelosi How funny two faced @NancyPelosi about transparency in the Democrats House but did not want transparency to the press in the WH meeting this morning
Looking to a bright future. In 2020 when Republicans retake the House there will no Paul Ryan and his spineless minions to deal with. Something to look forward to down the road. Republicans obstruct everything the Democrats push in the next Congress!
Sen. Scott: You’ve Misjudged Tom Farr, and Here’s Why https://t.co/xgTeHIjKax via @BreitbartNews I have been following this closely and @SenatorTimScott needs to study hard the true facts. Don’t fall into the fake Democrat race card lie the Democrat Party pulls over TRUTH!
How sad there is almost no mention that today is December 7, the 77th anniversary of the bombing is Pearl Harbor. I heard the first mention from Rush Limbaugh
@CorrectWinger She must be the stupidest socialist on the planet. And that’s saying a lot because socialism unto itself is a stupid concept.
@Ostrov_A @UN Why did we allow them to make this a 2/3 majority vote. These are normally a simple majority
@RichardGrenell Pull even more US $$ from the U.N.  Let’s see if they can survive on donations from Hammas.
@NancyPelosi You have a very warped interpretation of patriotism
@NancyPelosi @NancyPelosi would not know patriotism if it rose up and bit you in the a**
@marklutchman @PleaseUnRedact Got my vote although I have never watched. Just get the ridiculous excerpts from Rush or Sean.
@BreitbartNews And these wanna be’s have no clue what true country music is. These are wimpy jokes. That are typical liberal pop music singers
@BreitbartNews If we are lucky the Babs will melt down with global warming. Kinda like the WW of the West. 😂
@RealBasedMAGA Let it drop into the toilet. Then maybe they will be a little more compliant when working with their one true ally the USA
Ironic the White House press office held pressers for decades with journalists behaving civil most of the time. Today we have wanna be journalists acting like the liberal thugs they are. So we have to have written rules of behavior for the children
@RJNewsflash @Ocasio2018 is a typical loud mouth socialist. They scream and holler loudly with innuendo because they never can tell a truth because they would be exposed.
@realDonaldTrump @stacy_redvirgo Tell it Mr. President
@JoeBiden says he is most qualified in country to be president. If so we should just pack it in....WE ARE DOOMED!
@AppleBooks APPLE INC. Stop trying to cram her crap down my throat. That racist, commie
@brithume LOL
@BreitbartNews And many don’t believe you have a legitimate brain. NEXT COMMENT FROM THE SCREAMING COMMIE?
@w_terrence Tell the “twits” to worry about their own followers. We understand everything you say @w_terrence
@JoeNBC Also incorrect in your facts but as a liberal socialist no one is surprised. Democrats always cook the stats
@JoeNBC You are a journalistic joke and disgrace
@DRUDGE_REPORT Would like to see them lose it all and her behind bars

@chuckwoolery But she always look like a horse trying to grab for food. And angry on top of that
@BreitbartNews Just what we need an addlepated octogenarian socialist as president. That is almost as bad as a seventy something lying, cheating self absorbed female as president
@RepSwalwell We try very hard never to listen to you @RepSwalwell
@chuckwoolery She has the typical ill tempered, Ill mannered racist Democrat. And yes I said racist
@RealSaavedra She made one of the most stupid, ignorant statements I’ve heard in sometime. Considering her political leanings I’m not amazed
@ChuckGrassley While my father was a veteran and also USN retiree with over 34years of service that is NO carte blanche for everything you do for the rest of your life. Example: Sen John McCain was a horses ass as a politician.
@charliekirk11 Yes but @charliekirk11 who in the mainstream media reported this
@SebGorka The entire morally bankrupt Democrat Party should resign.
@BreitbartNews He opens his mouth and @JerryBrownGov proves he is a Moonbeam
@chuckwoolery @BreitbartNews Yes this is typical of the spineless never Trumpers like @BillKristol
@TheOfficerTatum God bless the honest man @TheOfficerTatum
@EricHolder What a typical racist answer @EricHolder
@DRUDGE_REPORT What idiots run CNN
@JeffFlake @kyrstensinema Well we got a flake to replace you but thank God you are gone
@SarahPalinUSA And @MichelleObama says America was afraid and resentful of the Obama’s in the WH. WRONG! It was DISGUST!
@JeffFlake @ChrisCoons Piss on that legislation @JeffFlake and @ChrisCoons. There should be legislation to end remove the special counsel legislation
@chuckwoolery LOL she and the audience demonstrated ju st how stupid they are!
@SarahPalinUSA Well that is $89,999.99 more than I would pay!
@JohnKasich Because they are NOTHING like @JohnKasich
@DRUDGE_REPORT Heaven forbid, keep him buried in Jersey
@SenBlumenthal Great commentary from @SenBlumenthal THE LIAR
@9_Moley @realDonaldTrump Maybe the Mole is better buried in the sand
@brithume Sorry @brithume it may martyr him but he needs to go. The American people are tired of your so called journalism, Shepard Smith shows more and more of his bias...even Uncle Walter Cronkite showed his. STOP HIDING BEHIND A PHONY “HOLYER THAN THOU ATTITUDE”.
@chuckwoolery @BreitbartNews Joy Behar confirms what so many know. She is a brainless fog horn. There are NO districts to gerrymander for the Senate, each state gets 2. The audience applause shows how many Americans are dumbed down by public education.
To APPLE, INC. I am a loyal customer because I like your products, BUT stop with your blasted posts telling me how to vote as a damn Democrat communist. You do it very subtly just like the devil tempts. Keep this up and I and hopefully millions of your customers go to competitors

@No2Progressives @ThunderMarg @brithume Sad but true
@chuckwoolery Can you believe the accuser demands Kavanaugh give testimony before she gives her story. What happened to being allowed to face your accuser and responded their accusations, not the other way around
@NancyPelosi @NancyPelosi have you and your husband taken that deduction yet
@chuckwoolery Considering she is beginning to look like the Crypt Keeper, maybe her thought processes are turning to mush
@EricHolder This is not a democracy @EricHolder, liar liberalism, we are a Constitutional Republic..the only true democracy existed in the city state of Ancient Athens, and even there it was short lived.

@RepSwalwell @RepSwalwell taking the Lords name in vain just tainted any argument you have. Wicked, wicked liberalism

@SenWarren @CFPB I am pleased your socialist org is being repurposed and hopefully dismantled by the Trump administration, wicked, wicked liberalism you have in your heart @SenWarren

@michaelbeatty3 @xwordmark That just too damn funny. No other way to describe

@RWPUSA @commondreams @RWPUSA read the Constitution you moron, you put your foot in your mouth almost as much as Moron Maxine. Democrats need one more dumbass like you. The answer is the Constitution does not require a president to set a blind trust, they did not exist then anyway or any separation.

Pelosi calls questions about her leadership 'sexist' https://t.co/OZTLrd1jHL #FoxNews	Being a moron has nothing to do with gender. Typical Democrat, try to point the argument to something completely gender based or racial when you don’t have a factual leg to stand on.
@marklevinshow 😂😂😂😂😂😂 God bless you @marklevinshow
@JeffFlake Thank the Lord you are leaving @JeffFlake since you have been a complete loss for AZ and America
@JoeNBC And you @JoeNBC are the self appointed paragon of patriotism! Hell I shutter at the thought because if that’s so we have reached the abyss. Praying for you and your fellow socialist
@KatiePavlich @SenWarren continues to spew lies since she could not find the truth if it bit her on that saggy ass
@charliekirk11 @charliekirk11 if you give a jackass a bit of power and a ridiculously large purse and what do you get.....a jackass like @MichelleObama  with an insatiable appetite.
@BreitbartNews She has convinced the 4 viewers of her show 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Koch-Founded Cato Supports Kethledge to Replace Kennedy | Breitbart https://t.co/40EHo2QWaV via @BreitbartNews @realDonaldTrump sir this is a great reason not to nominate Kethledge. These RINO’s are no friend of conservatism
@Alyssa_Milano I believe the likes of the @Alyssa_Milano types are the rock bottom showing us what degenerates can do to a society
@charliekirk11 @SebGorka Personally I like Rush Limbaugh’s assessment, Pocahontas is as WHITE as toilet paper. LOL 😂 All kidding aside you are right on @charliekirk11
@davidhogg111 @tedlieu I can see a whiner like you supporting an immature adolescent whiner like @davidhogg111. You both need the US Constitution class from Hillsdale College. Guess what it really is FREE, something you socialist might be amazed about.
@RealJamesWoods Better look out @kathygriffin you are not one these ladies favorites either. They may want to MEET you up close.
@VP @POTUS Dear @VP I pray Hardiman or Kethledge are NOT picked. If my senator, unfortunately Lindsay Graham is for either of these I know I am not! Lindsay Graham is not now or has ever been a true conservative. I do not like either ones stance on immigration and the border.
We already know she is mental since she cannot accept SHE is the reason SHE lost, but I believe Hillarious will have physical ailments that will prevent her running.	Is Hillary Clinton secretly planning to run in 2020? https://t.co/jmuacHSIMy via @nypost.

@RyanAFournier What a big hairy wimp he was. Typical socialist whiner, nothing to bring to the table except nasty, physical behavior. What a real MAN he wasn’t.
@ananavarro You are the perfect poster child ( child is correct) for the twisted ideology of a liberal leftist party with nothing to bring to the table except the inane rantings of the likes you @ananavarro
@SenJohnMcCain Thanking you for your service @SenJohnMcCain
@SenJohnMcCain Looking forward to a strong true conservative in the AZ Senate seat.
@dbongino How tragic @BarackObama would say, “if they bring a knife you bring a gun”. How funny they twist things to suit their warped agenda.
@ericbolling @HillaryClinton is just a damned disgrace (another reason America rejects her, but she would never admit it). @ericbolling you called it well.
@RealJamesWoods I believe you showed the great difference between liberals and conservatives @RealJamesWoods, civility and respect. Raving Maxine Waters could learn a lesson from you.
@realDonaldTrump Please @realDonaldTrump appoint someone you trust who is not a lifer like Wheeler. He will never continue the work of cleaning up the EPA like Pruitt has done.
@tedlieu @SpeakerRyan And if you had a brainstorm @tedlieu it would truly be a miracle. You spout off like a whale but you never offer a solution. Can’t you do anything without getting approval from you Mommy Pelosi? What a hack!
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @RepMaxineWaters @NancyPelosi what about the 400,000+ legal American children separated from parents because of incarceration. Or 600,000+ legal American children in foster care for whatever reason. No you self-righteous BLANK, you don’t care about them or the 2000 illegal children either!
@RealJamesWoods You speak profoundly @RealJamesWoods. So the BSDM guy was just another liberal pervert teaching I our ultra liberal university system across this country. Pray for our Nation as we remember her birth

@FoxNews @KamalaHarris Just another mindless socialist democrat talking head, an automaton.
@GovMikeHuckabee Governor congratulations to you and Mrs. Huckabee for the great Christian values you instilled in your daughter @PressSec. I am proud of her work for our president.
Standing with @PressSec in her gracious behavior in the sight of the INTOLERANT LEFT. Never judge a book by the cover, look inside the pages of the liberal left and truly see the ugly rot.
@DRUDGE_REPORT These are the ignorant like those in Nazi Germany who did nothing as Jews were persecuted because it was not them. These intolerant socialist liberals will one day wonder what happened when their “benevolent socialist society” takes their same rights. Then it will be too late.
@tedlieu @PressSec @POTUS Yes,@tedlieu your inaction speaks volumes you damn hypocrite
@dbongino Amen, @JohnBrennan is a national disgrace. He is a perfect reflection of the @BarackObama administration
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery I predict a big John Goodman belly flop

@Acosta A Mushmouth FAKE, photo op. These have been Lewis’s signature moments for years. Look at his record, a do nothing for years but tote water for Democrats and suck off the government teet!
@brithume America lost a gentleman debater. He was very much in the mold of the great William F. Buckley. He never got loud, bullish or in your face but his message rang loud and clear.
@SarahPalinUSA Considering it’s Juan Williams I am sure you really aren’t that surprised. He loves to rake black conservatives over the coals but has toted water for Democrats for years who use him shamelessly. Sometimes I wonder if he is really that dumb.
@NancyPelosi That statement is so ridiculous, I think you should remember this statement; “physician heal thyself”.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump If I didn’t know Cain spoke on of the first lies, I would lay it with @tedlieu because I find no truth whenever he opens his liberal, socialist mouth. Can we float California out to sea and rid the country of the entire lot?
@GlennKesslerWP And I am going to believe you and your liberal rag as a fact checker. I would call it yellow journalism but I question your credibility as a journalist

@ericbolling Why doesn’t he go back to pretending he can sing
@SenJohnMcCain If it was such a big deal why didn’t you step up to the plate when you were actively sucking off the government teet all these years in the Senate. Oh yeah, you would have had to go on the record and stand for something.
@BreitbartNews For someone who was a most gracious First Lady she should get a grip on reality and then SHUT UP
@tedlieu @SecNielsen Why don’t we let all the illegals go to California and let La Razahave their way and give the wholedamned state go to Mexico. Then mine the entire border with California
