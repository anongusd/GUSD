@mollysmcdonough Correct.

Don‚Äôt overlook how extraordinary it is that Kushner got a clearance. Presidents do not routinely step in and overrule the judgments of professionals who are paid to determine whether someone poses a potential security risk and thus shouldn‚Äôt have access to classified information.
No, there WERE issues with Kushner‚Äôs clearance, namely that his foreign government contacts, including ones he failed to report, sparked major concerns among US intel officials.

Public portion of the hearing has wrapped. After lunch, members and officials will meet behind closed doors. I'll share my report of the full hearing shortly.
Relevant to previous tweet, we're moving now into a pretty nuanced discussion of deep fakes. Something that the panel members have clearly been thinking about.
Safe and rather canned as many of these answers are, it's remarkable the variety of threats this hearing has covered. If the US is ever hit w/ another cyber attack, or North Korea launches a nuke, or Iran starts to build a bomb again, no one will be able to say we weren't warned.

@alexzfinley More or less.
Also, it's kind of nuts that we're 45 minutes into a global threats hearing, and nobody is directing the big questions to the director of the CIA.
Sen. Heinrich, asking why the White House gave security clearances to people with problems in their background investigations, doesn't ask CIA Director Haspel about it. Missed opportunity.
Would be more accurate perhaps to hear the DNI/FBI say that the United States has been remarkably ineffective at preventing billions of dollars in intellectual property theft.
It's stunning and rather dispiriting how officials are STILL talking about "waking up" to China's theft of intellectual property in the West. I've been writing that story for more than a decade, quoting the same types of officials.
Sen. Risch (who now chairs the Foreign Relations Committee) calls Russia's attempts to influence world affairs "ham handed." I think none of the officials testifying before him now would describe Russia's interventions that way. They've been remarkably effective.
Worth noting, FBI Director Chris Wray, also testifying today, made rare public remarks saying how angry he was about the shutdown. His employees took a hit.
Interesting contrast: Intelligence officials emphasizing the non-monetary rewards of working for the U.S. government. Lawmakers bemoaning U.S. government employees and contractors not getting paid in a shut down.

Russia will use cyber techniques to try to influence Ukraine's upcoming elections as well, Coats says.

@marty_lederman On that specific point I am not certain. But independent of Steele‚Äôs memos, the CI investigation suggests that the FBI was trying to understand if there was compromise.
There was indeed a great debate in newsrooms about whether to publish the memos. At the same time, many reporters, including me, were trying to corroborate the contents before the memos were ever published. We weren‚Äôt just focused on propriety and funding. https://t.co/D9pm2omzGO

And of course, the Russians could have looked at his extensive Russian social media profile. The Russians would have built a profile of Whelan well before he was arrested, the former CIA official said. ‚ÄúNone of this was by chance. This was a chess game.‚Äù
There is still no evidence Whelan was a spy for ANY government. But he traveled to Russia while on active duty, which would have basically put the Russian intelligence services on his tail, a former CIA chief of station in Moscow told us.
This is a potentially significant issue. These behaviors could be a sign of financial distress/debt, which is something any intelligence agency would try to exploit when recruiting an asset. It's why you have to disclose your finances when you apply for security clearance.

Like I said. A lot we still don‚Äôt know. And the Russians have yet to formally specify what exactly he allegedly did. That may explain why the US Gov‚Äôt is being so cautious. Not clear that anyone in the US really knows what the heck is going on here.
Whelan did travel in Russia. He had friends there. He learned the language‚Äîwhile in the Marines, even though his duties didn‚Äôt require it. Does this make him a spy? Of course not. But we still don‚Äôt know why he was drawn to Russia. It wasn‚Äôt related to his corporate security work
Whelan seems to have exaggerated some of his law enforcement experience. And his military career was largely administrative. Some co workers have fond memories of him. But some described him as naive. Not the kind of person suited for a career in intelligence.

Update: Per pool report, Sarah Sanders says that Trump spoke to CIA Director Gina Haspel and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo en route to California. Awaiting statements. Not clear yet what all was said.
‚ÄúIt is possible that this took place without his knowledge,‚Äù Trump said in an interview last month with the Post. That also contradicts the CIA‚Äôs findings that Mohammed, who exercises absolute authority in the kingdom, would have to know about an operation of this scale.
‚ÄúThis is a situation where everyone basically knows what happened,‚Äù said one adviser who talks to Trump often. This person said Trump has repeatedly criticized how Mohammed has handled the situation and has said it is clear they are hiding facts.
New: "We haven't been briefed yet" about CIA's findings on Khashoggi killing, Trump said. That's not true. He has been shown evidence of the prince‚Äôs alleged involvement in the killing, and privately he remains skeptical. 	https://t.co/PJHkfih0yN By me and @jdawsey1

I have previously recommended, and do so again now, @tcwittes's excellent piece on how to read these claims about Khashoggi, the MB, etc. Really good context for thinking about the politics of this call that MBS made to top WH officials trying to paint Khashoggi as dangerous.
In a statement, Khashoggi's family had this to say: "Jamal Khashoggi was not a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. He denied such claims repeatedly over the past several years. [He] was not a dangerous person in any way possible. To claim otherwise would be ridiculous.‚Äù
The crown prince's private portrayal, to his ally Kushner, of Khashoggi as a dangerous radical is at odds w/ MBS's public pronouncements that he was a friend and his death a tragedy.

So the bottom line: The US still isn't sure who is ultimately responsible for Khashoggi's death. Pompeo promises to get the facts and hold those responsible accountable. When that will happen? We'll see.
Asked whether he believes the Saudi official line, "we're going to accept what America learns. We've got people working all across the world." "We will learn the facts for ourselves." "The Turks have been very cooperative with us." Won't say if a US official has heard the audio.
Pompeo: "We're learning the facts." Declines to say, per Q from reporter, whether he believes Mohammed bin Salman was part of that coverup.
President Trump earlier, though, was more colorful, accusing the Saudis of a "coverup," "the worst in the history of coverups."
US will continue to "do our own fact finding," to ensure actions are based on "real data." To remind: CIA director Gina Haspel went to Turkey yesterday to gather facts and info. Sounds like US is not ready to make a call on what they think happened.
Pompeo says the administration is continuing to investigate the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Has ID'd some Saudi suspects. Issuing some penalties now, including visa restrictions. Not the last word, he says. Considering economic sanctions.

There are important--and I'll grant, sometimes subtle--differences between state propaganda and what intelligence officials and experts would deem actual "election interference." I await evidence that China is engaged in the latter.
There are many ways China tries to exert influence within our political system. But it does that the help promote Chinese policies and sell its national message. Russia, by contrast, tried to get people to vote for a particular presidential candidate, or to not vote at all.
In a hastily arranged conference call after the president made this claim, a senior administration official offered a lot of examples of how China tries to promote its policies in the US. But I heard no examples of "election interference." https://t.co/0QGM8JOywT

It appears that McFarland has settled her account with Mueller. A big question now is what information she could provide about what other senior Trump advisers knew about Flynn‚Äôs calls with the ambassador. /end
This was the day David Ignatius first reported Flynn talked to the ambassador, a key point in the Russia probe. McFarland said sanctions never came up. This was later contradicted by Flynn‚Äôs own guilty plea, as well as other evidence.
However, just days after Flynn talked to the ambassador, McFarland called me and said her memory was clear, and that Flynn and the ambassador had never discussed sanctions or how the incoming Trump administration hoped Russia would respond.
Eventually, McFarland and her lawyer convinced the FBI that she hadn‚Äôt intentionally misled the bureau and had spoken from memory, without the benefit of any documents that could have helped her remember. Mueller‚Äôs team appears to be satisfied with McFarland‚Äôs revised account.
For a time, investigators saw McFarland‚Äôs answers as ‚Äúinconsistent,‚Äù putting her in legal peril as the FBI tried to determine if she had lied to them. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his calls with the ambassador and has been cooperating with Mueller.
McFarland now says Flynn may have been referring to sanctions when they spoke in late Dec. 2016 after Flynn‚Äôs calls with Russia‚Äôs ambassador. But this summer, McFarland denied to the FBI ever talking to Flynn about any discussion of sanctions between him and the ambassador.

The plight of journalists who work in dangerous places is not unique to one person. But Foley endured a rare kind of trauma, frantically trying to save her son before he was murdered in front of an audience of millions. If that story isn‚Äôt hers, whose is it?
There's a fascinating dilemma here. Legally, the filmmakers were not obliged to pay or even talk to the families. But did they have an ethical obligation to do so?
The filmmakers insist the movie is a work of fiction. But the parallels between the main character, played by Susan Sarandon, and Diane Foley are striking, and the story bears many similarities to the ordeals other families faced while their loved ones were held by ISIS.

@YubNub11 It's a valid critique that many (certainly not all) journalists didn't cover Trump aggressively enough and take his rise seriously. I think Ben's essay is, in part, responding to that very critique. Do read it if you haven't.
@Aintropy That's all true. And to your last point, I think many of us on the beat have always kept that in mind, especially after 9/11 when the threat of attack was constantly used to justify once unimaginable policies.
@AndresFreundPol Excellent point. There was a more of this coverage back in 2005-06, and then again following the Snowden revelations, but we haven't kept up with it for our readers.
Ben is right to stop and ask how our work as journalists should respond to crisis in our national politics, at a time when the stakes are so very high.
And I think that has made me a better reporter, a more honest reporter. Certainly a more realistic one. For my journo tribe, the stakes have always been huge. The decisions always hard and complex. The outcomes always messy.
This resonates with me because I came of age as a national security reporter covering a time of crisis. 9/11 and its aftermath, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, torture, Katrina, the threat of war in Iran, the rise of cyber conflict. I have never known a period of peace or calm...
I need to think more about that. But in the meantime, I am lingering on this paragraph from his essay. https://t.co/scTwCx4xOn
Ben has also caused me to pause and think about what national security reporters like me may have missed. Where are our blind spots? What are we doing wrong? What can we do better?

This all casts a lot of doubt on previous reports that Cohen knew about or could provide information that Trump knew in advance of that "dirt" meeting in Trump Tower.
Burr says that Cohen had already told the committee he had no knowledge about that meeting until it was reported in the press. Naturally, the committee wanted to know if Cohen stood by his testimony. His lawyers said, yes.
"We have no insights" into any agreement Michael Cohen made with prosecutors, Senate Intel Chairman Burr said just now in press avail. But, committee recently reengaged Cohen after press reports suggested he had advance knowledge of Trump Tower meeting.
Update: "Cohen is expected to plead guilty to charges related to bank fraud, tax fraud and a campaign finance violation, according to two people with knowledge of the situation."

@artxmaverick See point 3.
@csdickey There are particular criteria based on the access one has. But generally? Trustworthiness. Lack of debt or other vulnerabilities that a foreign government could leverage. Loyalty to the United States.
4.) No current or former government official (that I‚Äôm aware of) has ever had a clearance revoked for the reasons the president gives here.
3.) And probably none of that matters, as far as any recourse Brennan might have. The president has essentially unchallenged authority in terms of who gets a clearance or not. No president has ever exercised that authority in this manner. But to be clear...
2.) The president clearly states that Brennan‚Äôs criticism of this administration is a reason he is revoking the clearance. He‚Äôs not even hiding that. I‚Äôll leave it to lawyers to address the First Amendment implications. But this is politically transparent.
Trump seems concerned that Brennan‚Äôs clearance makes him at least appear more credible publicly when he makes what the president calls ‚Äúunfounded and outrageous allegations... about this administration.‚Äù It‚Äôs the ‚Äúbelieve me, I know things‚Äù idea. Which goes to the next plank:
2.) Trump‚Äôs justification rests on a couple of foundations. First, the possibility that Brennan might violate the terms of his clearance by ‚Äúseek[ing] to use real or perceived access to sensitive information to validate [his] political attacks.‚Äù No evidence offered that he did.
Let‚Äôs be clear about some things. 1.) The president isn‚Äôt revoking John Brennan‚Äôs security clearance because he violated the terms of that clearance. Nothing in the president‚Äôs explanation today accuses him of that. (And the president‚Äôs lawyers obviously know that.)

This is really problematic. Without specifics--names or a description of what these others are doing or contemplating--it's hard to know how seriously to take this, and it looks designed to minimize the Russian threat. "Lots of people want to interfere in our election," etc. https://t.co/nrokq7UVNa
Hmm. Asked if Russia is the only country interfering in our elections, Sarah Sanders says "There are others," "our intelligence shows that there are a number of others" considering interference, but won't name them. Really?? Why not? This is very significant if true.
NSA director Nakasone was asked if he'd been given any orders or guidance to counteract Russian interference. He replied: "We're not going to accept meddling in the elections." Not really an answer to the question.
I think Wray just gave the state of play here: "We are not yet seeing the same kinds of efforts to specifically target election infrastructure" as in 2016. Voter rolls, for example. "What we are seeing are the malign influence operations," which he called "information warfare."
FBI Dir. Wray says bureau is sharing more info, "actionable information," with social media companies in ways that FBI wasn't in the past. So that's something?
Of Russian activities now targeting 2018 elections, "It is not the kind of robust campaign" that Russians did in 2016, Coats said.

And given the facts as we know them now, it‚Äôs hard to see the WH action as something other than punitive, taken because these former officials criticized the president.
But absent that evidence, it‚Äôs not clear that agency officials (CIA, for example) who may still hold these peoples‚Äô clearance would agree to revoke them. It‚Äôs been 1,000 times, but we‚Äôre in uncharted territory.
5.) Perhaps most important to the issues here, there WH has not put forward any evidence to show that these former officials improperly disclosed classified information or did something to violate the terms of their clearance. Now, maybe that‚Äôs forthcoming.
4.) Is the WH angry that these former officials go on TV and write books and op-eds and tweets criticizing the president? Undoubtedly. But they don‚Äôt need security clearance to do that.
3.) What does the WH mean that these former officials have ‚Äúmonetized‚Äù their clearance? Do they mean they have private sector jobs that require clearance? So do hundreds of thousands of people. Pull their clearances and the government would grind to a halt.
Two, how exactly the president could revoke or suspend a clearance isn‚Äôt well understood, because it hasn‚Äôt happened. This is a helpful guide to what Trump might do. https://t.co/lmoVhTAeLn
First, it‚Äôs not clear that many of these six former officials are engaged in money-making work that requires a clearance. Two of them, Comey and McCabe, don‚Äôt even have active clearance that gives them access to classified information. They were pulled when they got fired.

Coats‚Äô allies are on guard and see this as White House meddling w/ the intelligence director‚Äôs job. From our report last night: ‚ÄúFor someone in the White House to criticize Dan Coats for speaking truth to power is unfair,‚Äù the intelligence official said. https://t.co/7iRWIj8BKo
Maybe the president also sensed, even from afar, the mood of the room where Coats spoke. People applauded him because they regarded him as truthful, principled, and stable. The ‚ÄúCoats as anti-Trump‚Äù sentiment was obvious. People were talking about it after the speech.
Trump‚Äôs reported fury at Dan Coats for just speaking the truth helps explain why Kirstjen Nielsen was so incredibly reluctant to even say she agreed with what the intel agencies say about Russia, and would not utter the words ‚Äúthey tried to help Trump.‚Äù

Per WH statement, the invitation to Putin came from John Bolton. He would be the one to inform other agencies about this. He obviously didn‚Äôt tell the Director of National Intelligence.
Mitchell just broke the news on stage to Coats that, per WH, Putin is coming to Washington. ‚ÄúSay that again?‚Äù Coats asked. Audience erupts in laughter. He took a breath. ‚ÄúOk. That‚Äôs gonna be special.‚Äù
Coats asked whether he considered resigning. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a place I try not to go to publicly.‚Äù That‚Äôs not a no. So far at this conference, 4 senior Trump officials have been asked if they have considered resigning. 1 said no. The rest didn‚Äôt say one way or the other.

Mitchell asks how do you know what happened in Trump‚Äôs private 2-hr. meeting with Putin. ‚ÄúYou were on the dark side of the moon.‚Äù He acknowledges that. Says he thinks we‚Äôll learn more. Is there a risk Putin recorded it, Mitchell asks? ‚ÄúThat risk is always there.‚Äù
@TobyandMel @SaraCarterDC @mitchellreports Coats had the chance to correct any misrepresentation in Andrea‚Äôs question. He did not, because there wasn‚Äôt any.
But what about Trump saying ‚Äúcould have‚Äù been others, she asks. Coats allows other groups could be thinking about interfering. But then: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs undeniable that the Russians are taking the lead on this.‚Äù
NBC‚Äôs @mitchellreports asks DNI Dan Coats why he issued a statement affirming that Russia intervened in the elections, just after Trump said he doubted that. ‚ÄúI was just doing my job.‚Äù #AspenSecurity ‚ÄúI felt it was important to do that. ...It‚Äôs time to move on.‚Äù

You don't even have to read between the lines to understand the significance of this statement. This is not exactly a rebuttal to the president--tho it's close. But the intelligence community is essentially saying, the president can say what he wants. We deal in facts. https://t.co/f1ZkKEKY8l

The President of the United States, given repeated opportunities to unequivocally stand with his government against the claims of the Russian president, did not.
He then praises Putin for offering to let Russian intelligence officials come work with their American counterparts to find out what happened. "I think that's an incredible offer." Let this sink in.
History will note this moment: Asked who do you believe, Russia or your own intelligence agencies, Trump asks, "where's the [DNC] server." "I don't see any reason why it would be" Russia who hacked the DNC. "What happened to the server?" "What happened to the [Clinton] emails."

And what we don‚Äôt know yet: unclear how he first became involved in the case, the extent of the info he provided and the actions he took to obtain intelligence for the FBI, and whether his July ‚Äò16 interaction w/ Page was brokered by FBI or another intelligence agency.
In late summer, the professor met with Trump campaign co-chairman Sam Clovis for coffee in Northern Virginia, offering to provide foreign-policy expertise to the Trump effort. In September, he reached out to George Papadopoulos, an unpaid foreign-policy adviser for the campaign.
One of the people this informant met with, Carter Page, told us this: ‚ÄúThere has been some speculation that he might have tried to reel me in. At the time, I never had any such impression.‚Äù
The Post has confirmed the identity of the FBI source who assisted the investigation, but is not reporting his name following warnings from U.S. intelligence officials that exposing him could endanger him or his contacts.
And this is important: There is no evidence to suggest someone was planted within the campaign. The source in question engaged in a months-long pattern of seeking out and meeting three different Trump campaign officials.
The source, an America professor, was a longtime U.S. intelligence source. In 2016, he began working as a secret informant for the FBI as it investigated Russia‚Äôs interference in the campaign.

Meanwhile, the chair of the House Intel Committee, one of 8 lawmakers who is briefed on the most classified US intel operations, has not been talking to Trump, to avoid accusations that he is providing sensitive information to the president. He talks to the WH counsel instead.

@MiaMBloom @peterbergencnn She never claimed this was a unique insight.
"I wouldn't use Huawei products," Haspel says.
Haspel calls key passage in John Rizzo's book, calling her the person who "has previously run the interrogation program," wrong. Says that's not her.
"I would not allow CIA to undertake activity that I thought was immoral even if it was technically legal." That's a pretty broad and definitive statement and might be one of the most important Haspel makes all day.
Haspel says she knew there was disagreement outside CIA about destroying tapes. Says she believed there was to be a meeting with then director Goss before destruction. "I was working towards resolution within a process."
"I knew in my gut...that it was bin Laden," Haspel says of watching the first plane hit the World Trade Center. Her first day in the CIA's counter terrorism center was 9/11.
Haspel advocating for putting more CIA officers in the field and investing in more foreign language training.
@JordanSchachtel Excuses excuses! :)
"Why would they send you," Haspel says of male colleagues' reaction to her first chief of station assignment. She didn't identify the place, but it's Baku, Azerbaijan, from 1996 to 1998.
"I think you will find me to be a typical middle class American," Haspel tells senators, acknowledging that practically nothing is known about her publicly.
Haspel recognizes Sue Gordon, the No. 2 at ODNI, joining her. Gordon is another star in the intel community, and some think a logical nominee for the job Haspel is up for now.

@nycsouthpaw Ah ok. We have independent reporting about that.
@nycsouthpaw Sorry your screenshot isn‚Äôt loading for me. Don‚Äôt know why.
@nycsouthpaw What are you referring to?
Haspel is a student of Russian tradecraft, and many current and former officials praised her own and said she put it to use after 9/11 against al Qaeda. She also coordinated a plan to expel Russian diplomats from US allies after the recent nerve agent attack in the UK.
A friend of Haspel said she loves British mysteries. (She‚Äôs an Anglophile and lived in England growing up.) A fave TV show: The Americans, because she thinks it accurately depicts Russian spies‚Äô tradecraft in the 1980s.
There‚Äôs more in the story on her role in the interrogation program and tapes destruction. Better you read that than me thread it. Following her CT work, Haspel became chief of station in London, a plumb job. She actually has done it twice.
Haspel requested an assignment in counterterrorism. Her first day on the job was Sept. 11, 2001. A friend and former colleague said Haspel was ‚Äúpresent at the creation‚Äù of the post-9/11 CIA.
Her first chief of station assignment was in Baku, Azerbaijan. There, she worked with the country‚Äôs KGB-trained intelligence service to intercept two Al Qaeda suspects tied to the 1998 US embassy bombings in Africa.
Some Haspel highlights: Her first assignment was in Ethiopia, where as a young field officer she got an impromptu assignment from Jimmy Carter. Later, she moved on to Ankara. Haspel learned Turkish and Russian in the CIA.

Yet, according to John Rizzo's memoir, Haspel and her boss were constantly lobbying him to approve of destroying the tapes. She was an advocate. Expect THAT to be a focus at her hearing next week. Not whether she was just following orders, but did she agree w/ the order.
Defenders of Gina Haspel's role in the tapes destruction episode frequently point out (as here https://t.co/tagazUYH2F) that she believed her boss would get approval before issuing the destruction order. And in any event, it was his call to make, not hers, they say.

One last thought, it's interesting to consider whether Susan Pompeo will take a similarly active role should at the State Department, should her husband be confirmed as the next secretary.
Does any of this matter? CIA says it was all cleared, and is in keeping with past practice of other directors' spouses--and there's a record to back that up. But in the current climate of abusing perks and travel benes, it's no wonder these activities are raising eyebrows.
A CIA spokesman said that decision was reviewed and ok'd, and that it was done to prevent the director's security detail from having to travel with him out of state, which costs $ and keeps the security officers away from their own families.
The agency, and a past director, defended her work. But it has raised questions internally, as has the Pompeo family's use of a CIA facility during the Christmas holiday.
Other directors' spouses have played similar roles. But it's not expected that they will. There isn't really a "First Lady" of the CIA. That said, Susan Pompeo has long said that she considers herself a partner in her husband's career in public service.
Susan Pompeo uses  office space on the CIA's 7th floor and is assisted by CIA staff in her volunteer work at the agency, which is focused on family and quality of life issues, particularly for CIA officers overseas. (The staff aren't dedicated to her and have other duties.)

@ScottCPhilips I think so.
Many CIA officers will be celebrating this morning that Haspel and not the other rumored short-listers got the job. More on that later today.
Haspel also has basically zero public profile. One former intelligence officer this morning predicted she won‚Äôt have the same pull with the White House that Pompeo did. We shall see, of course. CIA is an extraordinarily powerful agency.
Haspel will also be the first woman to lead the CIA. Others have been short-listed in the past. This is a big moment in the history of the agency, which has emphasized workforce diversity in recent years, and for the intelligence community.
Some initial observations on what this means for CIA. Haspel is a long-time, career Intellience officer. Not a political operator like Pompeo. She will probably inspire confidence, sense of steadiness among the CIA workforce.

@packerpoppa @VioletaQSmith The President, ultimately.
@Deborah_T7 Yes he can.
@MiekeEoyang Yes, hence why I wrote this in my tweet above: "Won't comment on whether Trump will just give Kushner a clearance, which he can do."
It's hard to see how Kushner could keep doing his work w/out a clearance. He leads Mid East peace efforts. He's a snr. adviser to the president. He reads the daily intelligence briefing. He participates in meetings where class'd info is discussed. This requires a clearance.
Sanders: "I'm not aware of any red flags" raised during Kushner's background investigation. "He's going to continue to do the work he's done over the last year." Won't comment on whether Trump will just give Kushner a clearance, which he can do.
"No decision within the memo will impact anything Jared Kushner is working on," Sanders says of policy announced Friday, which would take away Kushner's interim top-secret security clearance. Declines comment on Kushner's clearance itself. Backstory here. https://t.co/ZktfQXPF3Z

@wi11iedigital I know people who've read it in under an hour. But they were reading every word.
@PaulSchmehl We quoted him on this in our story.
@wi11iedigital Length varies. It's not a short memo, but it's not a big GAO report either. As for how long it would take, I think that's dependent on how fast is the reader, and is he reading every word or scanning.
@PaulSchmehl He's quoted on this subject in our story.
It‚Äôs completely Trump‚Äôs prerogative to consume information how he wants. But if the president thinks the PDB is too time-consuming, too dense, repetitive, or is deficient in some way, is the appropriate response to just stop reading it? /END
The point is, other presidents adapted the PDB to their preferred learning style. They made it fit their needs.
They also read it differently. Obama read the PDB on his own and asked questions in follow-up meetings w/ analysts. Bush read it while the briefer was in the room and had a discussion. Reagan read it alone then used it as a springboard for discussion with his aides.
But the fact that seven of Trump‚Äôs predecessors read the document, and immersed themselves in it to some degree, tells us that they thought this was a useful exercise, and that the PDB has some value. They read it because they got something out of it.
President Trump seems to prefer visual learning, considering the abundance of charts and graphics that his briefers use. He has also said several times that he doesn‚Äôt want to read lengthy documents. So perhaps his intelligence briefings reflect his learning style.
In the abstract, not necessarily. Different people absorb information differently. Some people are visual learners, some aural. Some get the most out of text, some from images. We know this.
Trump is the only president besides Nixon not to read the PDB since it was established in the Johnson administration. Is that a big deal?

Really good interview of @TGowdySC by @margbrennan on @FaceTheNation.
@jaybluuee @nakashimae I don‚Äôt know whether the judge would have decided differently with or without the dossier and more specifics on funding. Gowdy says the dossier was key but ‚Äúwe‚Äôll never know‚Äù if the judge would have not issued the warrant if a DNC/Clinton provenance had been stated.
@AndytweetM @nakashimae @Susan_Hennessey @MarkSZaidEsq I‚Äôd defer to Susan on that question.
@jaybluuee @nakashimae Because the dossier is not the basis of the fisa warrant application. It is one element of that application.
Import to remember that Gowdy, unlike Nunes, read the documents underlying the memo and the FISA warrant applications. He is also a former federal prosecutor.
@nakashimae Core of Gowdy‚Äôs complaint is that the judge needed to know specifically that DNC/Clinton were funders and DOJ was obliged to say so. This point has been debated by legal experts and prosecutors. One (opposing) view here by a top 4th Amendment expert. https://t.co/JcIa01320V
Gowdy also confirms @nakashimae reporting that the FISA application didn‚Äôt specify DNC or Clinton campaign as dossier funding sources. But the application DID explain that some info was paid for by a political entity. https://t.co/uKSZQBO34E
@TGowdySC Gowdy defers to FBI and DOJ on whether to release the full FISA application. Needs to avoid exposing sources and methods.
‚ÄúIt was not the exclusive information relied upon by the FISA court,‚Äù @TGowdySC says of the Steele dossier. But says he doesn‚Äôt think the judge would have approved the warrant absent the dossier‚Äôs inclusion. Dossier was included in every application (4) to the court.
‚ÄúThere is a Russia investigation without a dossier,‚Äù @TGowdySC tells @FaceTheNation.
@nedryun Honest question: What information would satisfy you at this point and earn back your trust? Do you want to see the underlying FISA warrant application? Something more/less? Thanks
@knittingkris Yes
We have a new tension here, between those calling for ‚Äúradical transparency‚Äù (release the warrant application) and those, particularly in the law enforcement and intelligence communities, who would see that as an irreparable break in the four-decades old oversight process.
WSJ editorial calls for more of the documents behind the memo (and Dems‚Äô memo too) to be released. Others have called for same. Feels like we‚Äôre moving towards possible release of the FISA warrant application.

@agile_mind @OrinKerr Well, embedded in their argument is this idea that had the judge known Steele was doing political oppo research, and that he didn't want Trump elected, the judge wouldn't grant the warrant. And based on experts I've talked to, I don't think that's right. Is at least doubtful.
@agile_mind @OrinKerr Cold? No. Try hard to verify its allegations? Yes.
AND DON'T MISS: The memo acknowledges that it was information about George Papadopoulos that triggered the FBI's investigation in July 2016. That refutes the widespread allegation that the Steele dossier was the impetus for the investigation.
Not to be overlooked in today's news: A congressional committee has publicly verified the existence of a FISA warrant, among the most closely guarded secrets in gov't. Will seem a minor, technical point now. But that's extraordinary, and (I believe) historic.
@yougetgelato @NoahCRothman @OrinKerr I'm not sure it says quite that--that the DOJ didn't tell the FISC the verification was in its early stages. But you are correct that the memo claims that the dossier hadn't been fully verified at the time. Tho it doesn't say which portions of the dossier were key to the warrant.
@CthrnAnn @OrinKerr I'm not characterizing it that way. The memo makes clear that Republicans believe Steele had an expressed anti-Trump bias that was not conveyed to the FISC.
That's the legal reality. The political reality is another matter entirely. And that's the reality we find ourselves in now.
@ScottCPhilips @OrinKerr For the warrants to be renewed, the investigation would have to show some progress. So I think the answer to your question is yes.
Upon first read of the memo, crux of the critique is that the FISC wasn't told Chris Steele was anti-Trump and that his work was paid for by DNC. For a thorough explanation of why that might not matter (legaly) when getting a warrant, see @OrinKerr here: https://t.co/dabxTjEMiX

@lrozen Right.
Others have said they found no evidence of votes being changed. To certify that the totals were not affected is a different statement.
"We can certifiably say that no vote totals were affected," Burr says. That's actually stronger that what other officials have said.
"We look forward" to presenting findings w/ public, but Burr says can't say when that will be.
Listen to what Burr is NOT saying, tho. He's not dismissing the dossier or affirmatively saying it's not credible or accurate.
"The committee cannot really understand the credibility" of the dossier w/out knowing who paid for it and who were the sources, Burr says.
"Unfortunately, the committee has hit a wall" on the Steele dossier, Burr says. Offers to meet w/ Steele "have gone unaccepted."
Burr says Senate intel committee will NOT release Facebook or other ads shared with it, following committee practice not to release docs.
"We're developing a clearer picture of what happened" re: potential collusion, Burr says. Investigation not finished.
Burr says intel committee continues to investigation "collusion," but as far as Comey firing goes, that inquiry has reached its end.
"We trust the conclusions" of the intel community's assessment that Russia interfered in the election, says (GOP) chair of intel committee.

Asked what Russians may have on Trump politically, personally, or financially, Clapper says he hopes that's what Mueller gets to bottom of.
Clapper wonders if Trump is "trying to make Russia great again...that's a real concern...Russia is an existential threat to this country."
Clapper says it'd be appropriate to suspend Kushner's security clearance while the extent of his foreign contacts is sorted out and reported
Dossier "wasn't used at all" in reaching conclusions on Russian interference, Brennan says.
On call, Trump asked Clapper to put out a statement rebutting claims in the Steele dossier.
After Trump compared IC to Nazis, Clapper says he called Trump. Told him comments were an affront to the workforce of the intel agencies.
At Jan. 6 meeting w intel heads Trump gave no pushback on IC's Russian interface conclusion, Clapper says. No "400-lb. guy on the bed stuff"
Clapper: On potential for cyber partnership with Russia, "dialogue for them is a one-way street" to get info from the US and use against us.
"Very dangerous" for Trump not to use trusted US translator when spoke at dinner w Putin, Clapper says. "You can completely miscommunicate"

RT @PaulSonne: Comey says that whether Flynn made false statements to the FBI was "the subject of a criminal inquiry"
@davidgura Suspect there are a few seagulls flapping on over to Columbia Law School right about now.
Thinking Roy Blunt might not have expected that answer...
Points for honesty. Jim Comey describing in detail how he leaked his own records to a reporter through a conduit.
Comey read "let it go" re: Flynn as "whether there were false statements made to federal investigators." Not just Flynn misleading Pence.
Wish Dan Richman were live tweeting...
Well then: Comey says he asked a Columbia law professor and personal friend to read the contents of his Trump memos to a reporter.
Comey: "It was of investigative interest to us" why Trump was pressing on Comey to drop matters.
Important clarification: When Comey told senators there was no counter-intel inv. on Trump, didn't mean to imply might be a criminal one.
Catch that? Comey aware of "a variety of reasons" why Sessions involvement in Russia investigation might be "problematic" before AG recused

4.) This is masterful distraction.
3.) We've spent a day talking about these baseless claims, and members of Congress have been forced to respond to them.
2.) The WH now wants Congress to investigate a baseless claim, has not said it will provide any evidence, and refuses to comment further.
1.) Let's be clear. There is zero evidence that Obama ordered a wiretap of Trump's phones. That's not even how wiretaps work.

@KirkWiebe then he just confirmed that a judge found probable cause to investigate a crime. That's how warrants are issued as you know.
@ganeshran seems a plausible explanation per Washington Post reporting.
5. That he claims Obama ordered the tap suggests he's confused or fabricating, because he clearly doesn't understand the legal process here.
4. If he's just making up claims about highly classified matters, that's also huge.
3. If there really was a wire tap then he just confirmed a judge found probable cause to investigate a crime. That's, uh, huge.
2. Trump can legally find out if he'd been wire tapped. Did he? Totally unclear how he learned this.

A portion of those in the crowd came in on their day off to hear that speech. Might have been different reaction on regular workday.
4.) This struck several people I spoke to as abnormal. Some were offended both by the speech and reaction to it.
3.) What's unusual is for the president to give a political speech. Attack media, his critics, and then for CIA employees to applaud that.
2.) CIA employees have applauded and cheered for presidents in the past.
After talking to a few intel folks, some context/perspective on that speech. 1.) Presidents DO come to CIA HQ to thank the workforce.
