@realDonaldTrump how does a business making billions pays no taxes. my wife and I fixed income of $53K end up paying $1,700.00 in taxes under your new tax plan, partly due to the reductions in allowed itemization in your tax plan. Trump you have lied again brother
Obama said we will miss him when he is gone! Guess what 75 % of us do! https://t.co/15kvquZpK7
@KeishaBottoms Please contact me Ernest Simmons,  I'm a former community development officer, Assistant director of Housing Authority, Realtor and General Contractor for both Residential and commercial development. Vietnam Veterans, 44 years married which took a lot of determination
@foxandfriends People these people on fox and Rush are the new communist Party. They rarely tell their viewers of the wrong Trump is doing, but always what they think is a good thing. 	And Hannity and gang in my opinion are communists!!
@mmurraypolitics And finally you are allowing all kinds of security issues to develop. And to tell you the truth I wonder if you are allowing some kind of security breach to take place while our security is down and losing focus on potential problems.
@mmurraypolitics He hasn't even made negotiations with property owners, so why not get all the need properties and cost estimates with ENGINEERING plans and while your getting that together REOPENED THE DAM GOVERNMENT! THIS US THE ASS BACKWARDS WAY OF DOING THIS!
@mmurraypolitics He has to dealing abilities at all! A real talented negotiator uses positive negotiating strategies and tactics! In any negotiations you give an take, and you must be able to justify the need, and where are the plans and cost estimates??
@Independent He like Laura Trump and others must don't live in the reality world, these folks must be out of there F#%king minds!  Ask them if they are still getting their money!
@KristinMinkDC @SenMajLdr This guy is a Communist and traitor to the people he supposed to represent and our Country!! He has and overall responsibility to the American People not the president! It wasn't the president who put him in office, it was those people that he had arrested !
@BoldTV For her and the rest who feel and talks like her, YOU ARE OUT OF YOUR DAM MINDS! 	SHE WOULD DIE IF SHE COULDN'T GET HER DAM NAILS DONE. BUT SHE AND HER FAMILY HAVE MONEY AND REPORTEDLY STEALING MORE FROM EVERYWHERE AND FROM WHOEVER!
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Please tell everyone or ask, wouldn't it be better to spend the 5 billion on providing clean safe drinking water and a delivery system. Half of our country is drinking contaminated water that is causing health problems and issues of health, let's do that!
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Please do not give in ! Because like you said he would do it again until 60 billion is spent on this wall that can be dug under as it already is being done.
RT @ErnestS34642753: @SpeakerPelosi please if you are going to make a deal for whatever, you need to include full protection of the Muellerâ€¦
@joncoopertweets Whatever happened to respecting your elders? I would like for all news stations show the full video of this.
With half the country drinking water that is unfit and causes several health problems, that 5 billion dollar would do a lot for providing clean and safe water and supply lines. Tell Trump to stop hiring illegals and others like him, then most will stop coming
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Mr. President you own this shutdown along with Senator Mitch McConnell with Republicans. Why didn't you push this hard while you had all 3 houses, you did nothing then ,why now!!
RT @codeofvets: EMERGENCY: Veteran in Crisis Jemez Mountains NM! DM @CLWAL02 IF YOU LIVE IN THIS AREA! RETWEET! https://t.co/lz3k9jCMrN
@RepEscobar @SpeakerPelosi If you give Trump anything, please include complete protection for the Mueller Investigation and make the report available to the public! And please change all nuclear codes. This president may start a war to protect his own behind!
@RepSusieLee @SpeakerPelosi @senatemajldr If you all are going to give Trump anything, in your deal you must include complete protection for the Mueller Investigation and the report must be made public! And whatever else you may give DO NOY INCLUDE ANY WAR AUTHORIZATION, AND CHANGE ALL NUCLEAR CODES!
@RepGwenMoore @SpeakerPelosi Whatever deal that maybe made, you must include complete protection for the Mueller investigation and make the full report to be shared to the public!
@SpeakerPelosi please if you are going to make a deal for whatever, you need to include full protection of the Mueller investigation and the report is made public. And if you can rehire Mr. Comey to take control of the FBI and or the Justice department.
@fortjacksoncg @FortJacksonPAO @CSM_Gan I can be reached at bowiered@aol.com , please let me know the gradation book or  photos can be found and purchased. 	Thank you
@fortjacksoncg @FortJacksonPAO @CSM_Gan Good afternoon Sir	I'm Ernest Simmons Jr, sometime between May 69 and August 68 I was trained at A/5/1, Sgt. Sims was my DI . I would like to know how if at all can I get a copy of our Graduation Book, during those times I could not afford the book.
@realDonaldTrump Well time will only tell and only you can make it true or false! If you and your appointees do not interfere or close the investigation, and if that investigation proves you innocent, then you got my vote in 20, if you interfere in any way, you might as well just say your guilty
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch I want to know if it all us true or not! They have spent millions of dollars investigating Trump and his administration, as taxpayers we have a right to know what if anything was found. And all Republicans remember this what you are allowing Trump you will have to allow dem pres
@realDonaldTrump You can stop a lot of this all around the world by just telling those in charge of those countries to stop scaring and killing people and just do right to them all. Doing this will stop it everywhere, cut out money to  them and aid, it will stop the fleeing!
@realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Kemp did a few things wrong from the jump! One he should have removed himself from his position, 2 he pushed a form of voter suppression and removed over a million from voter registrations,  it's these things people are MAD AS HELL ABOUT! So do the right thing
@realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA Sir once again I must say to you, NO DECLARING A WINNER UNTIL ALL VOTES ARE COUNTED, MAIL IN'S AND OUR MILITARY ALL SIR HAVE TO BE COUNTED. THIS IS HOW IT SUPPOSED TO WORK! AND THE MORE YOU ARGUE THIS THE MORE PEOPLE WILL DEMAND IT TO BE!
@realDonaldTrump No sir these are votes that were not counted! In the future no one should declare winning UNTIL EVERY VOTE IS COUNTED TO INCLUDE MAIL IN AND OUR MILITARY, IT IS THEN A CANDIDATE SHOULD BE DECLARED THE WINNER AND NOT BEFORE!!
@realDonaldTrump Sir all new elections were coming and some problems were known by all! The former Governor FAILED HIS RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THOSE PROBLEMS WERE FIXED, HE FAILED IN DOING HIS DUTY!! AND NO MATTER WHAT SIR ALL VOTES HAVE TO BE COUNTED!!
@PatriotMike6 And they failed to make sure any and all known problems were fixed, but they didn't! If there was a problem with personal, fix it, if there's problems with registering, fix it! So all of what is happening is their own faults, they failed and now complainting!
@PatriotMike6 I don't want any voting that may not be here legally, but from my understanding anyone voting has to have documents proving they are here legally!	And let's be clear, the former Governor and others new the election was coming, and they had time to fix all &gt;
People this is a start of something that should have been started long time ago!		https://t.co/DUbegxk5rK
@realDonaldTrump Mr. president you could solve this problem simply by telling the dictator to stop killing his people and you need to get rid of the hundreds or thousands that you employ! Try also to pose high fines to people who employ them, like you do that would be a real change.
@Douglas_jay_66 @realDonaldTrump Hello my friend you are absolutely correct about Trump using him, but since I left Vietnam and the Army, I can't remember ever seeing a Black Man receive this Honor it ment a lot to me, that's why I said what I said. So many have never been Honored and know ones there stories.
@ChuckGrassley When Obama administration wanted to do more to secure the border you all blocked him from doing it. And you and your way of handling Kavanaugh trial was a shame and one day your daughter or granddaughter will be faced with the same as Mrs. Ford went through.
@Jim_Jordan You and the rest of your traitors have lost all of your HONOR, MORALS AND PRINCIPLES! I also believe that the bombs being sent out to Democrats are being done by members of your party or one of those hate groups that Trump praised after the killing in Va. Shame
@Jim_Jordan Jordan you and your other traitors in Congress and the Senate need to stop trying to destroy our country and our Democracy. And it's a shame that you all refuse to make Trump do what's right, you all desperate to keep your jobs that you all would lower yourselves to the gutter.
@Jim_Jordan Like all the other crooked dealings in this administration, its my belief that Trump or Steve Bannon groups did this knowing or thinking it would add to the lies already being told. We the people have already read the same book Trump did on Hitler and his strategy.
President Trump this is your fault! All of your hate speeches and comments about being a Nationalist, You sir are empowering these no good people, you are giving them all a license to burn kill and destroy, you must renounce them all an get all law enforement on this!
People why do so many of us allow ourselves to be manipulated on what is really important? People running gets away from committing on real needs so they are not promising you anything of real importance, stop allowing this to always happen. 		https://t.co/DjthlHHi0L
@Douglas_jay_66 @USMC @realDonaldTrump Stop the division of all the people. We are all Americans and it's your job and your responsibility to unite us as one, so sir please start doing that so that maybe I can give you thanks again.
@Douglas_jay_66 @USMC @realDonaldTrump President Trump I'm a sometimes a harsh critic on you and your presidency and administration. But I'm also a person who will give credit when due, this is one of those times that I must give you that credit and also say thank you.	I just wish that you would
People this is the goal and the reason Putin wanted and helped Trump to win the presidency. People please open your eyes and ears before it's to late!	https://t.co/yotaIqNlh6
Senator Flake and any other law abiding Republicans, you all know that we have a traitor as president and now you all are about to give him a new weapon of mass destruction, Kavanaugh. Trump wants him there to keep him out of jail not because he is the best available. https://t.co/jezjsCGJRg
@dwallbank @elwasson When Kavanaugh was asked to request an FBI investigation, if he wanted his reputation and his named restored, if he had been cleared by them, I and others would have more respect for him. He will not be considered the Honorable Judge Kavanaugh NEVER EVER!
@dwallbank @elwasson If anyone really believes that then why did they restrict the FBI and gave them limitations as to what they were allowed to investigate. Doing that just makes the hold thing look even more shady and suspicious.
This should not be kept from the Citizens of the United states of America, it is not a top secret item and it is not classified, but if it is WHY??
This was nothing but BS ,and these senators should be ASHAMED.  One day it maybe you're daughter or granddaughter, will you just allow a BS investigation when that day comes, I don't think so! REMEMBER THIS, WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND, GOD IS WATCHING YOU!
@7sevenOf9Nine @in2caffeine @ChuckGrassley @senjudiciary @GOP Or their President,   the hold truth for this guy being placed on the court is for Trump to use as his get out of jail card. Trump doesn't give a shit about anything other than his money and himself. And this investigation was a diversion for Republicans.
@mentor2k @ChuckGrassley @senjudiciary The real questions that we all should be asking is why will it not be available to the public, as all others have been. Just think, if innocent why wouldn't he ask for a full investigation TO CLEAR HIS GOOD NAME, WHY!
@ChuckGrassley @senjudiciary You sir are and out right liar, you did not allow a complete and full investigation of Kavanaugh, shame on you and your other crooked members. One day it maybe you're daughter or granddaughter  then you will know you have been punished for this day.
@realDonaldTrump This wasn't an investigation, this was nothing but a diversion to make you all look like you were being fair, SHAME ON YOU ALL!!
@senatemajldr The Honor that our Great Country had been admired for is Gone! Our President, Senate and Congress has no Honor or MORALS and they all have disgraced our already Great America, we can never again go into another country and tell people what's right or wrong, SHAME
Another Republican who has no problem supporting people that are much like Trump. People what has our country become, NO MORALS, NO HONESTY, NO COMPASSION, NO HONOR, NO VALUES, NO PRINCIPLES. PEOPLE OUR LEADERS ARE NO LONGER HONORABLE.	https://t.co/wfuCxd0Vbj
@JeffFlake Today Sir when you took the floor and said what you did say, YOU DID THE RIGHT THING AND I'M PROUD OF YOU FOR THE COURAGE THAT IT TOOK FOR YOU TO SPEAK OUT. SIR ALL OF THE TRUTH MUST BE KNOWN, WHATEVER THAT TRUTH MAYBE. 	THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU.
@TheBeatWithAri @mayawiley Get Trump's accusers to speak out, where are they?
@JonFlan Get the woman who has claimed Trump inappropriately touched them or did whatever.  These women seems to have disappeared, why??
@orawoa @YouTube Arbi whatever happened to the women who claimed Trump was inappropriate with them. When will they speak out about they experienced and what they are now doing,  can we get them on TV ?
@ShortMshort3224 Hello my brother, I was in the Nam 69, 70 as a door gunner 191st AHC, welcome home. 	Short it's my opinion that there is no Honor left, no Respect, no Honesty and no Pride. And no true leadership.
@Jim_Jordan Your overly concerned about the investigations information, Makes me think that you and others YOUR NAMES MAYBE ON THAT OR IN THIS INVESTIGATION. That just the way it appears.
@PiperPerabo I wish someone would get the name and position of the young lady sitting right behind Kavanaugh . It is just my opinion that she is more than a SECRETARY or just a friend. We need to know to see if she is something else!
Would be or become a president for all the people. And that you would work to resolve problems that our country has. But instead of you calming you sir have MADE IT ALL WORSE.
@realDonaldTrump First of all this statement was not written or produced by you Sir, I don't believe you have the ability or the understanding of writing or understanding of what real truth is. You sir have shame the office of the president. At one time I had hoped that you

@POTUS but before I go I would like to know that they all will be safe from harm and HATRED. I SERVE IN VIETNAM TO DEFEND OUR NATION AND ITS PEOPLE, I WOULD DO NOTHING LESS FOR MY LOVE ONES, SO SIR IF YOUR NOT GOING TO UNITE US ALL, THEN GIVE UP THE PRESIDENCY.
@POTUS dinner with our families and to be able to save some for hard times and to be able to pay our bills. Sir my children and my grandchildren children mean everything to me and I will do anything protecting them, JUST AS YOU WOULD, my time here is soon to end
@POTUS so I'm begging you to discontinue your present agenda and do some real work for the little people us common folks who will most likely never be rich or wealthy. All we ever wanted is to work, get a decent pay that would allow us a vacation, to go out to
@POTUS you are driving me crazy with the way your handling so many issues, sir you are not helping to unite our country, you are further dividing us STOP! YOU HAVE ME AFRAID FOR MY CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN, YOU ARE CREATING ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF FEAR AND FRUSTRATIONS
@POTUS President Trump this morning I awakened with blood coming out of my nose, head throbbing and pulse was going crazy. I'm a Vietnam Veteran with server PTSD, I'm pleading with you to stop all and any kind of talk related to hate, I'm begging you to stop!
@realDonaldTrump I can see many criminals use some of these tactics in their trial,  so remember I'm telling you all that this is going to open a flood gate of legal consequences and it will not be put back in the box.
@realDonaldTrump From what I'm reading there are people who are saying braking laws don't matter,  how realistically foolish that is. If you all believe that its alright to brake laws, then we need to empty all the jails and free everyone. Laws are for everyone to include Trump
@POTUS President Trump it is now that you can show and prove your innocent,  so why hasn't you gone infront of Mueller to talk openly? Show us how brave and truthful you are, tell Roddie to step away and no restrictions people of America wants you to!
Will this include all the good Europeans he spoke about or just certain kinds of people?		https://t.co/VB9RcFoGg7

Prove to all Americans that you are not, all you have to do is tell Putin to stay in Russia and then order that the entire voting system be protected immediately!! https://t.co/SDvD9fZmmm
@USArmy To my fellow Americans and Veterans we are living in unpredictable times. I  fear that one day you will be asked to turn your weapons onto Americans I will hope and pray that it never happens, I pray hard that you all will never do it cause if does all will be lost.
@SpeakerRyan I would also ask why Senator Mitch McConnell hates America as he does, it seems like after Obama was elected, he has turned his back on Americans and America for putting a black man in the WH. He refused to have a vote on protecting voting system and Mueller .
@SpeakerRyan Why are you not pushing for protection of our voting system? We people believe that the Republicans will cheat in this upcoming elections. We want to know that we will have a fair and honest election process, is that to much to ask for??
Wait until the PEOPLE HAVE THEIR CHANCE TO VOTE, LIKE WHAT THEY DID TO OBAMA.
@GreggJarrett Why don't we get them all in a giant conference room, connect all of them to lie detector and get them all to ask questions about everything! Obama, Trump, Clinton, McConnell,  Comey, Jarrett, Trump jr., every last one of them on national TV so we can see all
@GreggJarrett Show us what proof you have, that confirms your claim.
@repdavetrott I haven't seen any gains, if I see anything its costing me and others more. And why does Trump lie so much when we see and hear him do whatever, and when he realizes that he messed up, he uses his favorite punching bag OBAMA, LIKE ALL OF YOU DO.
@Jim_Jordan How did you know that, did someone leak that information to you? And since you guys always use Obama name for cover ,where is all the concerns about this president and his over protection of Russia and Putin?
@Jim_Jordan And what has the president leaked or sold to Russia. And why do you always try to normalize his wrong doing and worse, you appear to be involved with what most people believe is treasonous.
@repdavetrott Let's just call it what it is, the GREAT GOVERNMENT CON! 	THATS ALL THAT IS APPROVED BY THE SECOND GREATEST CON MAN IN THE WORLD DONALD J. TRUMP AND THE SECOND GREATEST CON MAN SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL, WHO I BELIEVE HATES AMERICA BECAUSE OBAMA GOT ELECTED.
I'm so sick and tired of all the bullshit from everyone! Let's cure the problems, all of them. From the president on down to the news reporters, all of you get on a boat and just sail away. And let the real people rebuild with people who care about all people.

@sartoris1960 @Jim_Jordan @senatormcdaniel And lets not forget that as long as employers like Trump is not penalized for employing these folks, they will keep coming. Just go visit Trump hotels and casino, you will find illegal immigrants working. Penalizing the employers will stop more than a wall.
@sartoris1960 @Jim_Jordan @senatormcdaniel They know that a wall is not the answer, there are tunnels up to 200 feet below the ground, they have submarines in the ocean and let's not forget the good old boys who fly their aircraft in an out daily. These are just some of what Congress knows!
@Jim_Jordan You want to spend $25 billion dollar on a wall that will never stop people from coming, while there is a greater need for clean water and supplying it. There are tunnels everywhere on and around the border, and submarines in the ocean.

@SenateMajLdr @POTUS I would also like to know why you and others haven't done anything about protecting our voting system and rights, WHY???
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS You sir in my opinion have betrayed your country and its people by many ways. The main reason is how you allow this president to continually brake laws and incite hatred and divison.

@RWPUSA instead of Trump concerning himself with what football players do or don't, he should be firing that joke that supposedly is running the EPA.

The way it all supposed to work, but it isn't! https://t.co/5vlBUmZImV
@realDonaldTrump You and I both know who is putting the  your information out, it's so obvious,  nothing of great importance, why? Because you control what is being allowed out and then call it leaks,  your plan to destroy our news agencies and networks.
Thank you and God bless you and your family.
@Stonewall_77 Just ask cause I have been looking.  The president collected $6,000.000.00 for disabled Veterans,  I know he collected it and was supposed to have distributed it to 4 to 6 veterans organizations,  I can't find nothing saying he gave it all out, so you have something?
@RepJackBergman one question, when will you be able to provide clean drinking water to your your state?
@RepLawrence one simple question,  when will the people of Flint get clean running water.
@repdavetrott when will you and others restore and replace the poison that's being sold to the people in Flint? It's been far to long, get it done!!
@Stonewall_77 Mr. Jackon I'd like to asked you a question? Its simple and if any of your followers care to give and answer, please do. 	WHAT MAKES A PERSON AND AMERICAN.  	I would appreciate you and others would answer that one question.
@Stonewall_77 Rosenstein is doing his job, let's not be mad about that, we must allow him and others to do the same. We are a country of laws and those laws must be enforced and obeyed, to include the President.
@Stonewall_77 And investigation would be done and either I would be found guilty or innocent. If potus is found to be innocent, I would write him and apologize for how I felt, but if guilty then he like you or I must be punished!
@Stonewall_77 All of us can claim a party,  what's important is that we share all ideas and opinions and then make a decision  on whatever. No one is always right or wrong. We must demand that the truth is found, if you are I was accused
@Stonewall_77 We must protect all of our people, if you have ever been in a firefight, you know you have to depend on all of your fellow Americans who are being shoot at just like you. It is up to guys like you and I to make sure our government  really truthful and honest
@Stonewall_77 And as I have said to them all, Republicans, Democrats and Independents are not always right or wrong. This tactic of divide and conquer has been the greatest tool ever used in a dictatorship, we have a duty to realize what is really happening.
@Stonewall_77 Mr. Jackson no matter the party we as people who love our country must stop allowing a few people to keep us divided and fighting wars that makes them richer, while we stay poor. My 208 children are from every race and party.
@Stonewall_77 Not 44, but 208 or my children listen and share opinions and ideas.
That's how we help to make our country great. Hell man I love you already so let us continue to talk. Please tell your family that I hope for them all to have a great day.	ERNIE
This president has had so much scrape going on since he walk thru the door. And I  promise you that by the time that his first term ends, you will say Ernie you were right. But let's you and I continue to talk and share opinions and maybe ideas.
My table and home with all. And we have all kinds of conversations. My children who has served and some still there share a lot with me, some good stuff and some bad. I'm a guy who loves everyone, we are all Gods children,  and as God loves so do I.
I listen to all, even with the news. There are things that I agree or disagree with whether or not its either Rep or Dem, neither is always right, but I do know BS when I see and hear it. My two hundred children are from many families and I have shared my
I have no followers, because I'm a leader, my seven sons Amy other 200 children some are Republicans and some are Democrats and Independents. I didn't like Clinton or Romney. Mr.Jackson I'm not a person who agrees with just because. https://t.co/5OUDOm0I45
@Stonewall_77 And just to let you a little about me. In Vietnam 69, 70. I volunteered for the Army at 17 years, I volunteered for Vietnam at 18, when many like your potus ran away, or their fathers money kept him out. Father of 8,grand of 15 and married 43 yr
@Stonewall_77 You are another blind and foolish person. This man is doing what he was hired for, unlike your potus who was a criminal before he got the Russians and others to get him in. Stop trying to normalize this crook.
@EdKrassen And he had VD and does cocaine and God only knows what was in his medical records. Unprotected sex and he was supposed to have been a germaphob, YEAH RIGHT!
@RepDevinNunes why are you so desperate to coverup or close the investigation,  if your boy is not guilty then he will look great, but you are making him look totally guilty!
@LivingOn18 @BreitbartNews In time we will find out that this cat is a traitor, and his ambition is money not truth and honesty. HE NEEDS TO GO!
@LivingOn18 @BreitbartNews Will someone please tell me whatever happened to wanting to know the truth, what happened to honesty and trust. If T is not guilty why interfere with the investigation??
@MedicVet68 Hello my brother, welcome home. I myself was a doorgunner DoungTam 69-70, 191st Assault Helicopter Company,  214th Aviation Group. Please stay in touch and let's share information.
This president knows full well what he is doing, tell a lie enough and keep saying it constantly, people start believing that true.most people will not investigate rather just believe what has been told.
@realDonaldTrump No we are not forced like you are trying to make it appear but, the force comes from greedy people and businesses, little hiring, low wages and prices on all keep going up! That's the force, so what r u going to do about it??
This president knows full well that the FBI and the Justice department can and will find all of his wrong doing. He has to brake up both departments to continue all of his crooked deals and that he maybe a traitorous person.
His saying he won't flip is enough to make you ask, why would Trump even say those words? We have a traitor in the White House a crook  and no one has done a background check on him, which should have been, why hasn't it?
Have any of you really listen to what Trump said about Cohen not flipping? Trump said Cohen won't flip. well it seems like Trump must have and idea or know that Cohen has information that could be useful and damaging to them both.
@AriMelber today I would like for you to tell us all why candidate's for office to include the President,  do not have to get a background check or drug test before being sworn in,  why is that???
@maddow Hello Lady, I would like for someone to tell me and others why candidate's for office to include the President,  do not have background checks or any drug testing before running for office,  why is that and why not??
@samdolnick @yashar @mikiebarb Why are we allowing the law breakers Trump and others, to get rid of good people like Comey for doing their jobs?
@jaketapper Jake I would like for you and others to inform people about the following.  Our candidates to include the President do not have to pass a background check or drug test, why is that? People need to know, I'm just learning myself.
@KingJames we need to let everyone know that their candidate's do not have to have a background check and no drug test, why is that and how many of us new that? We need to demand that this is changed.
@jimmykimmel would you please asked your audience how many know that their candidate's do not have to have a background check and drug test, and that includes the  president, why is that, and needs to be changed.
@TheDailyShow I would like for you to asked your audience, how many know that our candidates do not have a background check and drug test to include the President,  how many new that??
@ScottShaneNYT How and why is it that candidate's running for office to include the President,  why no background check and drug test before being sworn in or placed on ballot, why???
@costareports I want to know why politicians do not have a background check and drug testing. These people are supposed to be examples to us all, if not required for them should not be required for none of us!
@SallyQYates Where is the background check for the highest public office in the country, to work at the police dept or FBI, you have to pass a background check. The President should have been checked and drugged test.
@AliVelshi Of course he wants to fire anyone and everyone who maybe trying to show that he is a criminal and a traitor to our country.
@costareports It's time to lock him up for the crime of leaking information to a suspect, the President. He needs to be removed from office.
@SenateMajLdr Yet there has been nothing about Russia involvement in our voting system, WHY? You are looking into Clinton's, which I don't like.  You have covered this President knowing he is guilty for several crimes and you have tried to normalize him.
@SenateMajLdr The Republican leadership and members have done more to insulting the FBI, JUSTICE DEPARTMENT and other people who has not agreed with them than anything else.
@SenateGOP It is your Sworn Duty to protect the investigation to find the truth,we the people want and expect to have and know the TRUTH!
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @CIA This is your Frankenstein, you and party members built this traitor Trump. I hope you have a safe place when he starts his war, to cover his wrong doing.
@RNCWomen You must stop trying to normalize this president, he is not the man you want as a good leader. He is a womanizer and a threat to women's rights, normalizing him will be like normalizing your husband's.
@POTUS In your view he who is your Vice has views of your seat, he and others have planned your futures end!
@POTUS As I said yesterday, your name will be removed from every building it's on, Panama is just the first, in the coming weeks it will be more.
@POTUS And finally for tonight,  where is the collected money that you took in for the Veterans, 6 million was the number show us all where and who got that money that you collected on the Veterans behalf, where is it!!!
@POTUS out of the 25 to 32 million people who for now maybe supporting you,there are only about 15 million who may pound the sidewalk in your support and that's a big maybe. Stop being and ass and just do right thing.
@POTUS And when will you stop using Obama for your scapegoat and sour meat for your followers.  If you do interfere with the investigation the people will come out and demand your removal, this I promise you will happen.
@POTUS your cabinet members are and imbaracement to you and the White House, most have put themselves on your level and getting the same privileges that you have, hell maybe even more!
@POTUS the white supremacist that have so much hate, why do they not go overseas and release that hate, no that's not in them, they rather make trouble here at home and you appear to be helping them.
@POTUS In time your name will be removed from every building it's on, you will be hated by more than half of the white people in our country. This will not include your hate groups and the so called white supremacist groups.
@POTUS the only people supporting you are either those who will gain the most and the few others are blinded by the temporary relief, they will be hurt the worse.
@POTUS people are seeing the real purpose of your tax bullshit. Yes we may get a few crumbs today,but all that is gain will only last for maybe 3 years and then all hell will brake lose, we know it!
@POTUS You sir have made your own hell, you could have been the greatest for our time, but you gathered the worse kind to promote you. And you and them are making you look guilty as HELL!!
@Thomas1774Paine @RichardTBurnett As long as Sessions and the others are allowing the law to be processed, I myself support them and everyone who feels this way will support you all to.
@RichardTBurnett This president has a brain tumor, for him to say he is law bidding	Is a joke and all of his followers are traitor to our country. If he is innocent why always wanting to stop investigations.
@costareports Dam shame the people aloud the Devil to become the President, now people are blindly following and supporting the very Satan from hell in the White House.
@RepDevinNunes @realDonaldTrump You are disgraceful and a traitor of our country and its laws. You are helping to destroy one of the main fabrics of what makes our Nation great, STOP BEING HIS FLUNKY A COFFEE BOY!
@RepDevinNunes Traitor it's time for you to retire NOW!!!!
@RepDevinNunes It's time for you to retire, NOW!!!!
@LindseyGrahamSC @marthamaccallum @FoxNews You sir must protect the investigation we all want to know that we have a honest president who values our country and our laws. The people have the right to know.
@costareports They all are on Trumps pay the flunkies list of traitors, they are all criminals and only care about the money they maybe being paid or promised.
@costareports It's time to lock Nunes up for interfering with on going case to include providing secret information to a possible suspect of a crime.
He said then and now he is doing it, he has fooled the people as he said he could, that's why he said he loves uneducated people. https://t.co/mSMRR8fol1
@SallyQYates Will someone please tell me who did the background check for Trump,  or do you even have to get a background check for the Presidentcy,  if not should be.
@TomFitton That might all be true and is a lot of money, but at least he wasn't stealing while being President, and he wasn't taking Florida weekend trips every week.
@WLKY $25 Billion for a wall that won't stop drugs. No money for schools, no money for clean good drinking water and lots of money for flying to Florida every weekend.
@aDopamineFiend @RhodesIsland_ Hell you gotta have some fun while in the military,  look at the white house ha!
@SenSherrodBrown Privatization of the VA will be devastating for veterans health and how and if they will collect compensation. Be careful what you wish for.
@SenSherrodBrown We must unite to fight this home wrecker, every thing he touches turns to shit! Look at casinos. He is no business man,  he is a con man.
@BrianPaulStuart Trump collected 6 million and last I heard he still has not distributed the full 6 million, why and where is the money!!!
@BrianPaulStuart These So call Veterans for Trump, must be deaf and blind, this president don't give a shot about Veterans, wake up!!
@SenSherrodBrown Its pass time for all Veterans to come out and remind this president of his love for Veterans,  no privatization!!
@LunaLuvgood2017 @StormResist @DrDinD @ProudResister @Havok_2018 @B52Malmet @Elastigirl2018 @DonnaNoble10th @debbiesideris @NWPinPDX @AHamiltonSpirit Their state protesting for them to do the right thing or else!!
@LunaLuvgood2017 @StormResist @DrDinD @ProudResister @Havok_2018 @B52Malmet @Elastigirl2018 @DonnaNoble10th @debbiesideris @NWPinPDX @AHamiltonSpirit Why wait until he fires anyone else, not that he would go face to face to fire anyone. We need thousands from every state so officials see
@NewsUSAofficial Where is our country heading???
@SenJohnMcCain from Sgt. Ernest Simmons 191st AHC Doungtam 1969-70, bowiered@aol.com. You my friend take care of yourself ,Prayers for you
@SenJohnMcCain Hello my brother of combat. I wanted to wish you well and a very good recovery, I pray for you stay strong so I can meet you.
@TeamTrump is a very terrible pain you get when you don't take the medication,  worse than the back injury pain.Start and demand they fix it
@TeamTrump effect that comes with the use. I was given Oxycodone by VA 5 years ago for combat injuries, and now I struggle to get off. There
@TeamTrump To start you should demand that the biggest killers (Big Pharmaceutical companies) to develop a product that reverses the opioid
@wesley_jordan So very true and this Congress and Senate are helping him, when will the people move to demand that he be removed NOW!! TOMORROW IS TO LATE!
@SenKamalaHarris If they let him fire Mueller it will have a domino effect that will make him feel he can do anything he wants, and every president after.
@GStephanopoulos My entire family will be watching my friend,  good luck and stay strong.
@repdavetrott when are you all going to do something about the poison you all are allowing people to live with and bath drink, WHY!!!
@DrewBroach1 @BillCassidy @SenCassidy And at the same time helps with my injuries sustained while in combat.
@DrewBroach1 @BillCassidy @SenCassidy Legalization of marijuana will help in many ways, I know cause VA got me started on Oxycodone, marijuana helps to cure the need or cravings
@CoryBooker that they need for health,  schools, seniors and many other things. Legalization has far more positive results than negative!
@CoryBooker legalized marijuana,  hell liquor is far worse than marijuana and half the country is selling it and states are making money
@CoryBooker that do more harm than good. And the addictiveness of drugs like Oxycodone is far worse and costly than marijuana, find a way to
@CoryBooker it's been time to legalize marijuana,  you and I know it's used not just to jail us, but it will replace a lot of legal drugs
@ananavarro Where is our country headed with this guy running the ship? We all must get him out before he can become the first dictator
@CoryBooker that when the Democrats take back the house and Senate, they will be reinstated to their positions as long as they are truthful
@CoryBooker To you and my party,  it's time to fight fire with fire. Tell everyone who maybe afraid, tell them if they get fired by Trump
@POTUS And on another note, how low, just hours away from retirement you and whoever fired FBI Mccabe after 21 years, GIVE IT BACK !!!
@POTUS hate you. So put on your New York walking shoes and leave the investigation alone, unless of course you know that you're guilty!
@POTUS you interfering directly or indirectly. If you are found innocent people will start to love you, but as it is now we are starting to
@POTUS friends who do the same make it even more believable that you are guilty. So stop the BS and let this investigation be done without
@POTUS don't look at me look at him. You if not guilty you and you alone are feeding the people your appearance of guilt, and all of your
@POTUS Mr. President you are making yourself look so very Guilty, you are doing what my kids use to do, pointing the finger at his brother
@SenateMajLdr @MikeCrapo ,they will lose billions again cause daddy will give it all back AGAIN! Why are you doing this, what insurance do the people have? No good!!
@SenateMajLdr @MikeCrapo Why have you taken the leash off the irresponsible bankers, if you know you can screw up loose all your money, cause daddy will give me more
@Hotaugustknigh1 @RepMaxineWaters Those hate groups. You are probably a young person and knows very little about history,  I have lived it. Tell us what you know!
@Hotaugustknigh1 @RepMaxineWaters Louis does talk, but he has never gone out and killed, burn, boom churches, rapes women or enslaved a race of people.share your thoughts on
@RepMaxineWaters @MRoberts54321 That will take to long, we need to do things that make him work rather than watching tv.And my party needs to get their SH#! Together NOW!!
@bob_burrell @MRoberts54321 So how can we place him a straight jacket?If we the people don't do something NOW our beautiful country maybe less. Can the Brady act be use
@JoeNBC We all need to call out the Republican leadership and members.  I must say that it appears that they are all treasonous and don't care 4 USA
