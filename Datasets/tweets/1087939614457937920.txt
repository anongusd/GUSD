Nobody attributes a work of art like that of Michaelangelo's to his tools.	So why perpetuate the myth that blacks or any other minority race 'built America' in the same capacity as that of the Anglo-Saxon race?	The artist will accomplish his work regardless of the tools he uses.

This 500-character limit is killing me, Smalls.
History is the modicum by which we measure progress; our counsel of it is one of the greatest things that makes us distinct from animals.	It's not ironic that those who want to destroy it also perpetuate the myths that man is just a dumb, consumerist animal; unmoved by ideology.

"The things that will destroy America are prosperity-at-any-price, peace-at-any-price, safety-first instead of duty-first, the love of soft living, and the get-rich-quick theory of life."	- Theodore Roosevelt https://t.co/L4qzUwi7wd
We live in a country that has come to believe no personal sacrifice, no matter menial is worth perpetual national welfare. This is the consequence of materialism.	#TheOppressiveGentleman #Shutdown #GovernmentShutdown
"The voice of the people has been said to be the voice of God; and, however generally this maxim has been quoted and believed, it is not true to fact. The people are turbulent and changing, they seldom judge or determine right."	- Alexander Hamilton https://t.co/hNHxqpoyTM
This is one of the most manufactured incidents I've ever seen the media scrap for.		Having already achieved equality, the left has reintroduced racial group-think to us and wants the white man to acknowledge a place at the bottom of the hierarchy.		#MAGAkids #OppressiveGentleman https://t.co/pltH5luG9k
I just followed a bunch of Senators; they're all wearing suits and ties and it's quite boring.	It's hard to imagine any of these people quitting office to fight a war as some of their 19th-century predecessors did.
The largest irony of the much-anticipated 'Second Civil War' will be that we can determine our children's side, but not our own.		Perhaps the best practical argument against miscegenation is that your posterity will be the rope by which you hang.		#OppressiveGentleman https://t.co/kiVXs1sRxs
Single moms are out here saying that they 'ain't need no man' when their precious peanut butter angels are running around acting like the spawn of hell.		Stop defending the destruction of the family. It doesn't work.		#OppressiveGentleman #Family #singlemom
Despite the ravages of disease, war upon each other, and our conquest, the American Indians still compose ~1% of our population.		Their existence as full citizens is a testimony to our benevolence, a privilege that would have been exclusive to us if the roles had been reversed. https://t.co/rJ2gVh7dvH
