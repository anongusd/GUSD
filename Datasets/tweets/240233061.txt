@niyorty You said something abt his achievements which Europe is part of (i know you are not used to European trophies)
RT @Nostradonny: @DonaldJTrumpJr https://t.co/EFAI3D4XG7
@niyorty I dont think i am.	Your 1st tweet attributed Fergie's success to having refs in the pocket (i presume you are referring to the EPL).	 Are you saying he still put Champions league ref in his pocket cos he won 2 UCL titles?	Also, is that the reason Arsenal avnt won UCL in 125yrs
@niyorty And that made us win 2 Champions league in Fergie's era and Europa league in post Fergie era.		If you were/are that good, why haven't you won a single trophy from either the Europa league or Champions league
@niyorty And their is no Epl game that involved Arsenal with terrible officiating?
@niyorty Including the Champions league?		 I am sure the reason Arsenal haven't won the Champions league in over 125 years of her history is their inability to get the refs in their pocket.

@niyorty Me i am focusing on this particular executive oooo.
@niyorty The bar i set for NASS is so low while that of PMB is so high.		In this regard, i expected PMB to have acted immediately. It was an opportunity to prove to us that he is the man of integrity that he claimsnto be.
@niyorty Then what do u have to say avt PMB?
@niyorty NASS wont fire her naa.		NASS can only summon her.		But let's ignore the fact that NASS failed in their oversight function , what abt that of PMB?
@niyorty It's simple bro. It's  either you have it or you don't. 		Why is it taking NYSC 44 days and yet to real response?
@niyorty Nope. They want to compel NYSC to give us a clue on what happened so as to see if PMB will have the guts to eventually fire her
@niyorty By a body.		FG should have sacked after that open ended NYSC statement. 		It's 100% certain that she is holding a fake exemption certificate and FG and NYSC are keeping quiet about it.
@niyorty I bet you don't know the matter is in court as we speak so i see no reason while NASS will take the matter up since the case is in court. 		My point is that as a man of integrity PMB claims to be, he and Adeosun have been quiet for 44 days.		https://t.co/2KtR6tEXQF

I get your point in ur tweets, alll i am saying is what Cookie endured is remarkable and lengthy and it will be difficult for another woman to do the same https://t.co/emLPpmHTjE
@Emidemie @chezimor @Osi_Suave I think we are on the aame track here cos we now both agree that without the cheating allegation, the babe wont have filed for divorce.		If the statement above is true, then IMO, the guy didn't fight enough and did wrong wanting to marry the same gal you allegedly cheated with
@Emidemie @cedric516 @Jenn_nikolas @Osi_Suave So, marrying the girl you allegedly cheated on was the right thing to do having in mind what the girl have been through for the past 18 years?
@Emidemie @chezimor @Osi_Suave Did he fight enough?		Why was the divorce proceedings initiated?		Was he aware the wife's sisters were pushing the wife to leave him?
RT @chezimor: @raysmithlove01 @Osi_Suave Including her womb. Only for the man to start flaunting side chick wit her investment
RT @chezimor: @Emidemie @raysmithlove01 @Osi_Suave Fought ?? Did he try to put food on the table for one day during their 18 years marriage…
@yettyclassy @ayo_kunnu Just go joor 😂😂😂😂 https://t.co/VVjPr99IQs
@cedric516 @Emidemie @Jenn_nikolas @Osi_Suave Why did the girl file for divorce?
@yettyclassy @ayo_kunnu @Osi_Suave Are you kidney me? https://t.co/HkysjJWL0A
@YesImEgocentric @Emidemie @Jenn_nikolas @Osi_Suave I did empathise with the guy the first time i watched it but after balancing my thoughts,  i felt the lazy ass should have done more to keep the marriage. 		Ask yourself the reason the wife initiated the divorce.
@Emidemie @Jenn_nikolas @Osi_Suave I actually watched d movie twice dear.		My first time, i was blaming the lady but after watching it for the second time, i tried to empathise with the girl and i realised the guy could have done more
@Bismaek @Osi_Suave Its not abt the money bro.		Even if he didn't make the money, try to prove to her you were not cheating and also, try to be there for her.		Do you remember a part of the movie where the girl asked if the guy even know abt her needs?
@Osi_Suave You have a point there.		But the girl dropped over 300k cash for him and even sold her mum's house for the guy.		Its good we have an open mind about this.		They both have their faults but the guy shouldn't have moved on too easily like that
@KevinNalard @Osi_Suave There is no election or tenure in marriage. 		I am emphasising on the sacrifices made by the woman https://t.co/IeUEEIjzUh
@Emidemie @Osi_Suave Your second sentence is false		Can you imagine yourself giving 18 years of your life up,130m naira and your mum's house for a man's dream? 		And if yes, do you imagine what your reaction will be when that man is accused of infidelity with the same woman that made u lose ur womb?
@Emidemie @Osi_Suave When you consider what that woman lost for that sorry ass guy, you will see that he didn't fight enough. 		As i tweeted earlier,  the divorce was a result of suspected infidelity and the woman was pushed by the sisters that viewed the guy as lazy. He should have gone back to her
@Osi_Suave Bro, he didn't fight enough		The woman gave him everything(including the inheritance and 18 years) and believed him when he had no hope		When the divorce isshh came up, it was as a result of suspected infidelity. 		You don't go back to the woman you are suspected of cheating on.
RT @wordstionary: People will always disappoint you, to remain happy you must learn how to forgive, forget and move on.
@Osi_Suave She divorced the man out of frustration and that doesn't erase the 18 years of sacrifice for that fucking lazy ass		Dont forget the divorce happened as a reult of the cheating allegation		IMO, that sorry ass man didn't fight enough to keep the marriage. The woman gave everything

@trinisoftinc One of the primary duties of a responsible government as enshrined in the constitution is the protection of her citizen's life and property. 		Let's call a spade a spade.  It is so irresponsible of a government to watch its citizens die like animals.

@niyorty Nope.		We are far from it and we know and want to improve.		Is Arsenal world class?
@niyorty To manutd, they are not world class
@niyorty I came second and you mentioned it authoritatively that i wont win the league in 5 yrs and based on Statistics  and the available data (remember you came 6th), if it takes the team in 2nd position 5 years to win the league, it will take the team in 6th 20 yrs.
@niyorty You see my issue with Arsenal fans?		Jones, Smalling, Valencia, Young are all world class to you abi?		Well....i am dumbfounded
@niyorty And we are scared of that and thats why we are spending big and complaining abt coming second.		But if we are not winning the league in 5 yrs, it means you are not winning the league in another 20 yrs (making it 34 yrs) and you are comfortable with it.		How do you pple do it?
@niyorty Yes. Thats why i am thinking the guy is an Arsenal fan or has been associated with one for too long. 🤣🤣🤣🤣		Ti ewe ba pe lara ose, oma di ose
@niyorty Check my other tweet, you will note the reason why i mentioned West brom in the tweet.		Pep was appointed without experience but rmemba he had Messi, Xavi, Iniesta, Pique etc at his disposal and Arteta has Elneny, Iwobi, Ramsey, Mustafa and Co at his disposal.
@de_hnic @niyorty This is not even worth mentioning cos we are bigger than this
@niyorty The reason i brought out the point difference is to let you know that you are closer to West Brom than Man city.		How can Arsenal appoint Arteta and give him 50m after the season you have had. My reason for wanting to be an Arsenal fan	 	Manutd will either spend big or sack Jose
@niyorty We came 2nd (19 points behind City and 50 points above West brom) but still admit it was a failure and some people are calling for Jose to be sacked whereas Arsenal finished 6th ( 37 points behind City and 32 points above West brom) and you are abt to appoint Arteta. https://t.co/YG8h9V4N8J

@niyorty I see some truth though	1. PMB came with high hopes and to most peeps, he has failed (security, economy, infrastructure etc)	2. Based on his appointments, body language, i can say PMB is tribalistic	3. And his fight against corruption is a mirage while blaming every1 but himself

@nimiie_ @GiaIntl As a guy, u need to let out ur ego to agree the guy didn't fight enough for her.		I had to watch it again to agree to that theory.		Even though Mel asked for the divorce, it was as a result of pressure and frustration (the guy was lazy).		The guy should have fought more
@GiaIntl @nimiie_ You are very factual here. 		10m out of 150m or 75m doesn't make any sense		She literally gave her life up for him (against all odds)		She believed in him even after finding out he was an ex felon and unable to get a job (which is when she mortgaged the house)		The guy messed up
@GiaIntl @nimiie_ She had sacrificed so much for the guy to just let go like that (18 years, her mum's house and also 350k usd
@GiaIntl @nimiie_ Yes. Which means, she was expecting him to come back in a better shape
@GiaIntl @nimiie_ I agree with you.		I had to watch it again.		He surely didn't fight enough
