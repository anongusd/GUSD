“I largely do agree that all of the adults are one by one being forced out of the room. Anyone that had the standing or the independence to speak out to the President…has been pushed aside,” Democratic Rep. @AdamSchiff says. #CNNSOTU https://t.co/fQaEUjynCi
Democratic Rep. @AdamSchiff says that President Trump potentially invoking emergency powers to fund the border wall is “a non-starter.” #CNNSOTU https://t.co/N4a4NqoDwh https://t.co/HJs9nUaAb2
“We can’t allow this continual process…that if I don’t get what I want…I’m just going to shut down the government.

Alabama Democrat @SenDougJones: “We do not believe that the government should be shut down and the people of this country held hostage just for a political purpose that the President has right now. It is too important that government function, and function efficiently.” #CNNSOTU https://t.co/4H7NiMeKhj
Alabama Democrat @SenDougJones: “I am not going to give wall money just to give wall money. What I’d like to see is a plan about how that money is going to be spent, where it’s going to be spent. That’s what we’ve been lacking so far in this shutdown." #CNNSOTU https://t.co/w530DFi7av

Mick Mulvaney on whether he supports President Trump using his emergency powers to fund the border wall: “I’m actually heavily involved with it and have been working with all the Cabinet secretaries to try and find money that we can legally use to defend the southern border” https://t.co/It087SxX7R
.@jaketapper: Which former presidents told President Trump that they should have built a wall along the US-Mexico border previously?		Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney: “I have no idea. I have not asked the President that question.” #CNNSOTU https://t.co/7cJiXovG7X
Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney: “The Democrats … think that they are winning this battle politically and they’re really not interested in opening the government because they think the President is paying a price politically and that’s unfortunate.” #CNNSOTU https://t.co/JsTFuJaZkR
Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney says the latest meeting with Democratic leaders was “disappointing,” adding that they were there to stall on negotiations to end the government shutdown and “we did not make much progress.” #CNNSOTU https://t.co/ZkzltvrxYk https://t.co/LDpyAJBssv
