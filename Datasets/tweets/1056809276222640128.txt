As  the  total  energy  and  the  total  momentum  of  the  field  and,  in case  of  complex  fields,  also  its  total  electric  charge  turn  out  to  be  linear  functions  of  these  numbers,  they  can  be  interpreted  as  the  number  of  particles present  in  a

Especially  in  view  of  the  properties  of  the  radiation  in  the  thermodynamical  equilibrium  in  which  specific  properties  of  the  field  sources  do  not  play any  role,  it  seemed  to  be  justified  first  to  disregard  in  the  formal  process  of field

The  field  components  can  be  assumed  to  be  either  real  or  complex.  For  a complex  field,  in  addition  to  energy  and  momentum  of  the  field,  a  four-vector  can  be  defined  which  satisfies  the  continuity  equation  and  can  be interpreted  as  the

It  is  satisfactory  that  for  these  simplest  cases  of  one-valued  fields  the  energy  density  is  a  positive  definite  quadratic  form  of  the field-quantities  and  their  first  derivatives  at  a  certain  point.  For  the  general case  of  one-valued  fields  it

The  simplest  cases  of  one-valued  fields  are  the  scalar  field  and  a  field  consisting  of  a  four-vector  and  an  antisymmetric  tensor  like  the  potentials  and field  strengths  in  Maxwell‚Äôs  theory.  While  the  scalar  field  is  simply  fulfilling the  usual

always  connected  with  antisymmetrical  states  (exclusion  principle),  an  integer  spin  with  symmetrical  states.  This  law  holds  not  only  for  protons  and  neutrons  but  also  for  protons  and  electrons.  Moreover,  it  can  easily be  seen  that  it  holds  for
In  order  to  prepare  for  the  discussion  of  more  fundamental  questions,  we want  to  stress  here  a  law  of  Nature  which  is  generally  valid,  namely,  the connection  between  spin  and  symmetry  class.  A  half-integer  value  of  the  spin quantum  number  is

Such  a  state  is,  however, forbidden  by the exclusion  principle  in  accordance  with  experience,  because this  state  would  acquire  a  wave  function  symmetric  with  respect  to  the  two protons.  This  is  only  the  simplest  example  of  the  application  of
their  electric  charge.  If one  had  only  to  take  into  account  the  magnitude  of  the  interaction  energy, one  should  therefore  expect  a  stable  di-proton  or (M = 2, Z = 2) with nearly  the  same  binding  energy  as  the  deuteron.
fundamentally  different  from  electromagnetic  interactions. The  comparison  between  neutron-proton  scattering  and  proton-proton scattering  even  showed  that  the  forces  between  these  particles  are  in  good approximation  the  same,  that  means  independent  of
neutrons,  and  deuterons  will  give  us  further  information  about  the nature  of  the  forces  between  the  constituents  of  the  nuclei,  which,  at  present, is  not  yet  sufficiently  clear.  Already  now  we  can  say,  however,  that  these  interactions  are
The  simplest  possible  assumption  that this  spin  of  the  neutron  is  equal  to  ¬Ω,  just  as  the  spin  of  the  proton  and  of  the electron,  turned  out  to  be  correct. There  is  hope,  that  further  experiments  with  light  nuclei,  especially  with protons,
the  spin  I  =  1, as  could  be proved  by  the  investigation  of  the  band  spectra  of  a  molecule  with  two  deuterons 19 .  From  the  spin  value  I of  the  deuteron  can  be  concluded  that  the neutron  must  have  a  half-integer  spin.
the  neutrons  fulfill  the  exclusion  principle.		The  most  important  and  most  simple  crucial  example  for  a  nucleus  with  a different  parity  of  M  and  Z  is  the  heavy  hydrogen  or  deuteron  with  M  =  2 and  Z  =  1 which  has  symmetrical  states  and
that the  parity  of  M  determines  the  symmetry  class  :  For  an  even  M,  one  should always  have  symmetrical  states,  for  an  odd  M,  antisymmetrical  ones.  It  was the  latter  rule  that  was  confirmed  by  experiment  without  exception,  thus proving  that
In  case  the  neutrons would  have  symmetrical  states,  one  should  again  expect  that  the  parity  of the  charge  number  Z  determines  the  symmetry  class  of  the  nuclei.  If,  however,  the  neutrons  fulfill  the  exclusion  principle,  it  has  to  be  expected
After  the  discovery  of  the  neutron, the  nuclei  have  been  considered,  however,  as  composed  of  protons  and  neutrons  in  such  a  way  that  a  nucleus  with  mass  number  M  and  charge  number Z  should  consist  of  Z  protons  and  M  -  Z  neutrons.
nucleus.  It  had  to  be  expected then  that  the  parity  of  Z  determines  the  symmetry  class  of  the  whole  nucleus. Already  for  some  time  the  counter-example  of  nitrogen  has  been  known  to have  the  spin  Iand  symmetrical  states18.
the  sum  AI +  A2 +  .  .  . is  even  or odd.  This  holds  regardless  of  the  parity  of  S.  Earlier  one  tried  the  assumption that  nuclei  consist  of  protons  and  electrons,  so  that  M  is  the  number  of  protons,  M  -  Z  the  number  of  electrons  in  the
system  consisting  of  numbers  A1,  A2,  .  .  . of  different  constituents,  each  of  which  is  fulfilling  the  exclusion  principle, and  a  number  S  of  constituents  with  symmetrical  states,  one  has  to  expect symmetrical  or  antisymmetrical  states  if
predicted  slow  transformation  of  one  modification  into  the  other.		Among the symmetry classes for other nuclei  those with  a  different parity of  their  mass  number  M  and  their  charge  number  Z  are  of  a  particular  interest.  If  we  consider  a  compound

The  first  application  of  this  method  was  the  result  that  the  protons  have the  spin  ¬Ω  and  fulfill  the  exclusion  principle  just  as  the  electrons.  The  initial difficulties  to  understand  quantitatively  the  specific  heat  of  hydrogen  molecules  at  low
Therefore  the  ratio  of  the  weights of  the  rotational  states  with  different  parity  will  give  rise  to  two  different systems  of  band  spectra  with  different  intensities,  the  lines  of  which  are  alternating.
Transitions  between  one  state  with  an even  and  another  state  with  an  odd  rotational  quantum  number  will  be extremely  rare  as  they  can  only  be  caused  by  an  interaction  between  the orbital  motions  and  the  spins  of  the  nuclei.

two  spins  in  the  same  direction  are  necessarily  symmetrical.  Therefore  the  conclusion  was  reached: If  the  total  wave  function of  space  coordinates  and  spin  indices  of  the  nuclei  is  symmetrical,  the  ratio of  the  weight  of  states  with  an  even

It  could  easily  be  derived  that  in  the  ground  state  of  the  electron configuration  of  such  a  molecule  the  states  with  even  and  odd  values  of  the rotational  quantum  number  are  symmetric  and  antisymmetric  respectively for  a  permutation  of  the

The  important  question  of  the  symmetry  classes  for  nuclei,  however,  had still  to  be  investigated.  Of  course  the  symmetry  class  refers  here  also  to  the permutation  of  both  the  space  coordinates  and  the  spin  indices  of  two  like nuclei.  The  spin

As  soon  as  the  symmetry  classes  for  electrons  were  cleared,  the  question arose  which  are  the  symmetry  classes  for  other  particles.  One  example  for particles  with  symmetrical  wave  functions  only  (assumption  II)  was  already known  long  ago,  namely
The  former  case could  be  applied  to  the  electrons  in  a  metal  and  could  be  used  for  the  interpretation  of  magnetic  and  other  properties  of  metals.
the  statistical  consequences  have  been  derived  by  Fermi  and  Dirac 13,  for the  symmetrical  class  the  same  had  been  done  already  before  the  discovery of  the  new  quantum  mechanics  by  Einstein  and  Bose 14.
possible  as  soon  as the  mean  De  Broglie  wavelength  of  a  gas  molecule  becomes  of  an  order  of magnitude  comparable  with  the  average  distance  between  two  molecules, that  is,  for  small  temperatures  and  large  densities.  For  the  antisymmetrical class
admitting  all symmetry  classes.		Even  for  an  ideal  gas,  in  which  the  interaction  energy  between  molecules can  be  neglected,  deviations  from  the  ordinary  equation  of  state  have  to  be expected  for  the  reason  that  only  one  class  of  symmetry  is
only  one  class  of  symmetry occurs  in  Nature.  The  density  of  quantum  states  of  the  whole  system  then really  becomes  smaller  by  a  factor  N!  in  comparison  with  the  density  which had  to  be  expected  according  to  an  assumption  of  the  type  I
In  the  light  of  the  result  of  wave  mechanics concerning  the  symmetry  classes,  this  division  by  N!,  which  had  caused  already  much  discussion,  can  easily  be  interpreted  by  accepting  one  of  our assumptions  II  and  III,  according  to  both  of  which
In  this  way  a  qualitative  distinction  between like  and  unlike  particles  was  already  preconceived  in  the  general  statistical mechanics,  a  distinction  which  Gibbs  tried  to  express  with  his  concepts  of  a generic  and  a  specific  phase.

that  the  entropy  of  a  system  is  (apart from  a  constant  factor)  given  by  the  logarithm  of  the  number  of  quantum states  of  the  whole  system  on  a  so-called  energy  shell.  One  might  first  expect that  this  number  should  be  equal  to  the
larger  order  of  magnitude,  which  one called  exchange  energy.		Of  more  fundamental  significance  is  the  connection  of  the  symmetry classes  with  general  problems  of  the  statistical  theory  of  heat.  As  is  well known,  this  theory  leads  to  the  result

The  latter  holds  only  so  long  as  an  interaction  between  the  spin  and the  orbital  motion  of  the  electron  can  be  neglected.  In  this  way  the  para- and  ortho-helium  spectra  could  be  interpreted  as  belonging  to  the  class  of symmetrical  and
Indeed,  besides the  rigorous  separation  of  the  wave  functions  into  symmetry  classes  with  respect  to  space-coordinates  and  spin  indices  together,  there  exists  an  approximate  separation  into  symmetry  classes  with  respect  to  space  coordinates alone.
In  the  paper  of  Heisenberg,  which  we  are  discussing,  he  was  also  able  to give  a  simple  explanation  of  the  existence  of  the  two  non-combining  spectra of  helium  which  I  mentioned  in  the  beginning  of  this  lecture.
We  shall resume  this  problem  when  we  discuss  relativistic  quantum  mechanics  but wish  to  give  first  an  account  of  further  results  of  the  application  of  wave mechanics  to  systems  of  several  like  particles.
all  classes  different  from  the  antisymmetrical  one.  The  impression that  the  shadow  of  some  incompleteness  fell  here  on  the  bright  light  of success  of  the  new  quantum  mechanics  seems  to  me  unavoidable.
formal  rules  in  use  at  that  time,  will  also  rigorously  deduce  the exclusion  principle.  Instead  of  it  there  was  for  electrons  still  an  exclusion:  not of  particular  states  any  longer,  but  of  whole  classes  of  states,  namely  the  exclusion  of
general  assumptions.  I  had  always  the  feeling  and  I  still  have  it  today,  that this  is  a  deficiency.  Of  course  in  the  beginning  I  hoped  that  the  new  quantum  mechanics,  with  the  help  of  which  it  was  possible  to  deduce  so  many half-empirical
This  situation  appeared  to  me  as  disappointing  in  an  important  respect. Already  in  my  original  paper  I  stressed  the  circumstance  that  I  was  unable  to give  a  logical  reason  for  the  exclusion  principle  or  to  deduce  it  from  more
identically  zero.  The  assumption  III  can  therefore  be  considered  as  the correct  and  general  wave  mechanical  formulation  of  the  exclusion  principle. It  is  this  possibility  which  actually  holds  for  electrons.
As  we  shall  see,  the  first  assumption  is  never  realized  in  Nature.  Moreover, it  is  only  the  third  assumption  that  is  in  accordance  with  the  exclusion  principle,  since  an  antisymmetrical  function  containing  two  particles  in  the  same state  is
of  several  like  particles  in  Nature. 	I.  This  ensemble  is  a  mixture  of  all  symmetry  classes. 	II.  Only  the  symmetrical  class  occurs. 	III.  Only  the  antisymmetrical  class  occurs.
particles  are  permuted,  and  the  antisymmetrical  class,  in  which  for  such a  permutation  the  wave  function  changes  its  sign.  At  this  stage  of  the  theory three  different  hypotheses  turned  out  to  be  logically  possible  concerning the  actual  ensemble
Among  the  different classes  of  symmetry,  the  most  important  ones  (which  moreover  for  two particles  are  the  only  ones)  are  the  symmetrical  class,  in  which  the  wave function  does  not  change  its  value  when  the  space  and  spin  coordinates  of two

As  a  consequence  of  the  impossibility  to  distinguish  one  of several  like  particles  from  the  other,  the  wave functions  describing  an  ensemble  of  a  given  number  of  like  particles  in  the configuration  space  are  sharply  separated  into  different
As  it  was  first  shown  by  Heisenberg 12, wave  mechanics  leads  to  qualitatively  different  conclusions  for  particles  of  the  same  kind  (for  instance  for electrons)  than  for  particles  of  different  kinds.

Only  this  renouncement  concerning  the  old  claims  for  an  objective  description  of  the  physical phenomena,  independent  of  the  way  in  which  they  are  observed,  made  it possible  to  reach  again  the  self-consistency  of  quantum  theory,  which  actually
The  actual  observation  appears  as  an  event  outside  the  range  of  a  description  by  physical  laws and  brings  forth  in  general  a  discontinuous  selection  out  of  the  several  possibilities  foreseen  by  the  statistical  laws  of  the  new  theory.

Bohr  was  able  to  show  on  the basis  of  wave  mechanics  that  the  electron  spin  cannot  be  measured  by  classically  describable  experiments  (as,  for  instance,  deflection  of  molecular beams  in  external  electromagnetic  fields)  and  must  therefore  be

Since  that  time,  the  exclusion  principle  has  been  closely  connected  with  the  idea  of  spin.  Although  at  first  I  strongly  doubted  the  correctness  of  this  idea  because  of  its  classical-mechanical  character,  I  was  finally converted  to  it  by
the  spin  quantum  number  of  one  electron  is equal  to  ¬Ω  and  that  the  quotient  of  the  magnetic  moment  to  the  mechanical angular  moment  has  for  the  spin  a  value  twice  as  large  as  for  the  ordinary  orbit of  the  electron.

The  exposition  of  this  general  formulation  of  the  exclusion  principle  was  made  in  Hamburg  in  the  spring  of  1925 5, after  I  was able  to  verify  some  additional  conclusions  concerning  the  anomalous  Zeeman  effect  of  more  complicated  atoms  during  a
electron  is  carried  so  far  that  every  degeneracy  is  removed.  An  entirely  non-degenerate  energy  level  is  already  ¬´  closed  ¬ª, if  it  is  occupied  by  a  single  electron;  states  in  contradiction  with  this  postulate have  to  be  excluded.
The  fundamental  idea  can  be  stated  in  the  following  way: The  complicated  numbers  of  electrons  in  closed  subgroups  are  reduced  to the  simple  number  one  if  the  division  of  the  groups  by  giving  the  values  of the  four  quantum  numbers  of  an

For  a  given  value  of  the  principal  quantum  number  is  the  number  of energy  levels  of  a  single  electron  in  the  alkali  metal  spectra  in  an  external magnetic  field  the  same  as  the  number  of  electrons  in  the  closed  shell  of  the rare  gases

In  the  autumn  of  1924 I  published  some  arguments  against  this  point  of view,  which  I  definitely  rejected  as  incorrect  and  proposed  instead  of  it  the assumption  of  a  new  quantum  theoretic  property  of  the  electron,  which  I called  a
According  to  the  point  of  view  then  orthodox,  which  was  also  taken over  by  Bohr  in  his  already  mentioned  lectures  in  G√∂ttingen,  a  non-vanishing  angular  momentum  of  the  atomic  core  was  supposed  to  be  the  cause  of this  doublet  structure.
The  only  thing  that  was  clear  was  that  a  closer  relation  of  this  problem  to  the  theory  of  multiplet  structure  must  exist.  I  therefore  tried  to  examine  again  critically  the  simplest  case,  the  doublet  structure  of  the  alkali  spectra.
I  gave there  my  inaugural  lecture  as  Privatdozent  on  the  Periodic  System  of  Elements.  The  contents  of  this  lecture  appeared  very  unsatisfactory  to  me, since  the  problem  of  the  closing  of  the  electronic  shells  had  been  clarified  no further.

It  is  therefore  not  surprising that  I  could  not  find  a  satisfactory  solution  of  the  problem  at  that  time.  I  succeeded,  however,  in  generalizing  Land√©‚Äôs  term  analysis  for  very  strong magnetic  fields 2,  a  case  which,  as  a  result  of  the
The  second  difficulty was  our  ignorance  concerning  the  proper  classical  model  itself  which could  be  suited  to  derive  at  all  an  anomalous  splitting  of  spectral  lines  emitted  by  an  atom  in  an  external  magnetic  field.
One was  the  absence  of  a  general  key  to  translate  a  given  mechanical  model  into  quantum  theory  which  one  tried  in  vain  by  using  classical  mechanics to  describe  the  stationary  quantum  states  themselves.

On  the  other  hand,  the  anomalous  splitting  was  hardly  understandable  from  the  standpoint  of  the  mechanical  model  of  the  atom,  since  very  general  assumptions  concerning  the electron,  using  classical  theory  as  well  as  quantum  theory,  always  led

Following  Bohr‚Äôs  invitation,  I  went  to  Copenhagen  in  the  autumn  of  1922, where  I  made  a  serious  effort  to  explain  the  so-called  ¬´  anomalous  Zeeman effect  ¬ª,  as  the  spectroscopists  called  a  type  of  splitting  of  the  spectral  lines  in

However,  no  convincing  explanation  for  this  phenomenon  could  be  given  on  the  basis  of  classical  mechanics.  It  made  a  strong impression  on  me  that  Bohr  at  that  time  and  in  later  discussions  was  looking for  a  general  explanation  which  should

the  Periodic  System  of  Elements.  I  shall  recall  only  briefly  that  the  essential  progress made  by  Bohr‚Äôs  considerations  at  that  time  was  in  explaining,  by  means  of the  spherically  symmetric  atomic  model,  the  formation  of  the  intermediate
A new phase  of  my  scientific  life  began  when  I  met  Niels  Bohr  personally for  the  first  time.  This  was  in  1922,  when  he  gave  a  series  of  guest  lectures  at G√∂ttingen,  in  which  he  reported  on  his  theoretical  investigations  on
including  the  remark  of  the  Swedish  physicist,  Rydberg,  that  these  numbers are  of  the  simple  form  2n^2, if  n  takes  on  all  integer  values.  Sommerfeld  tried especially  to  connect  the  number  8  and  the  number  of  corners  of  a  cube.
Both methods,  which  did  not  appear  to  me  irreconcilable,  influenced  me.  The series  of  whole  numbers  2,  8,  18,  32...  giving  the  lengths  of  the  periods  in the  natural  system  of  chemical  elements,  was  zealously  discussed  in  Munich,
as  independent  of  models  as  possible,  of  the  laws  of spectra  in  terms  of  integral  numbers,  following,  as  Kepler  once  did  in  his investigation  of  the  planetary  system,  an  inner  feeling  for  harmony.
This  was  the  direction  which  was  taken  by  Bohr‚Äôs ¬´  correspondence  principle  ¬ª.  Sommerfeld,  however,  preferred,  in  view  of the  difficulties  which   blocked  the  use  of  the  concepts  of  kinematical  models, a  direct  interpretation,
One  was  an  effort  to  bring  abstract  order to  the  new  ideas  by  looking  for  a  key  to  translate  classical  mechanics  and electrodynamics  into  quantum  language  which  would  form  a  logical  generalization  of  these.

Pauli was the first to recognize the existence of the neutrino, an uncharged and massless particle which carries off energy in radioactive √ü-disintegration; this came at the beginning of a great decade, prior to WW II, for his centre of research in theoretical physics at Zurich.
His exclusion principle, which is often quoted bearing his name, crystallized the existing knowledge of atomic structure at the time it was postulated and it led to the recognition of the two-valued variable required to characterize the state of an electron.
https://t.co/uv6rFEXA7k	Pauli was outstanding among the brilliant mid-twentieth century school of physicists. He was recognized as one of the leaders when, barely out of his teens and still a student, he published a masterly exposition of the theory of relativity.
It was later discovered that protons and neutrons in nuclei could also be assigned quantum numbers and that Pauli's principle applied here too.
In 1925, Wolfgang Pauli introduced two new numbers and formulated the Pauli principle, which proposed that no two electrons in an atom could have identical sets of quantum numbers.
In Niels Bohr's model of the atom, electrons move in fixed orbits around a nucleus. As this model developed, electrons were assigned certain quantum numbers corresponding to distinct states of energy and movement.

It was decided that the four of them would do the calculation independently (remember, we are talking about elementary physics here). When they got together the result was 2-2. They finally broke the deadlock by counting Einstein‚Äôs vote twice. ‚Äì W. Furry (reconstructed)
As it happened, each found an error, so they were still in disagreement. At this point they went to their mentor, Paul Ehrenfest, who happened to have a distinguished visitor named Albert Einstein.
In other words, there are many opportunities to go wrong, and many do. Well, the story goes, each man did the calculation and when they compared notes they found they had opposite results. One of them had obviously made a mistake, so they went back to check their calculations.
This involved the kind of calculation that all pjysics students suffer through in which polarity, direction of spin, direction of magnetic field, the ‚Äúright-hand rule‚Äù, etc., get all confused and make the head spin (no pun intended).
After Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit had the idea that electron spin¬†might explain the anomalous spectroscopic results, there remained the crucial task of determining if the effect is in the right direction.
The next step was to see if this idea is consistent with experiment. During a course at Harvard University, Prof. Wendell Furry gave the following account of how this happened (as best I recall):
‚ÄúThat fits precisely in our hydrogen scheme which we wrote about four weeks ago. If one now allows the electron to be magnetic with the appropriate magnetic moment, then one can understand all those com¬≠plicated Zeeman-effects." ‚Äì S. Goudsmit
It means that there is a fourth degree of freedom for the electron. It means that the electron has a spin, that it rotates‚Äù‚Ä¶ I asked him: ‚ÄúWhat is a degree of freedom?‚Äù In any case, when he made his remark, it was luck that I knew all these things about the spectra, and I said:
Then Uhlenbeck appears on the scene‚Ä¶ he asked all those questions I had never asked‚Ä¶ When the day came that I had to tell Uhlenbeck about the Pauli¬†principle ‚Äì of course using my own quantum numbers ‚Äì then he said to me: ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt you see what this implies?
"The Pauli¬†principle was published early in 1925‚Ä¶ if I had been a good physi¬≠cist, then I would have noticed already in May 1925 that this implied that the electron possessed spin. But I was not a good physicist and thus I did not realize this‚Ä¶
Here is the story in Goudsmit‚Äôs delightful and self-effacing words ‚Äì a story that conveys the groping and uncertainty that exist in the struggle to understand nature, as contrasted with the logic and certainty that are imposed after the battle is won.
George Uhlenbeck¬†and¬†Samuel Goudsmit¬†were studying certain details of spectral lines known as the¬†anomalous Zeeman effect. 	This eventually led them to the realization that Pauli‚Äôs fourth quantum number must relate to electron spin.
The significance was found that same year by two Dutch physics students.
while two other numbers represent angular momentum, which has to do with the shape and orientation of the orbit. 	However Pauli could find no physical significance for the fourth quantum number, which was needed empirically.
In other words, once a given state is occupied, all other electrons are excluded from that state. 	Pauli realized that one of the numbers must represent energy, which is related to the distance from the nucleus (if we regard the states as orbits),
He showed that the various atomic spectra would make sense if the electron states in an atom are described by four¬†quantum numbers and if each of these states is occupied by only one electron.
Einstein‚Äôs theory. The article was so brilliant that when Einstein read it he commented that perhaps Pauli¬†knew more about relativity than he himself did.	In 1925, five years before postulating the neutrino, Pauli¬†introduced his Exclusion Principle.
Wolfgang Pauli¬†was born in Vienna in the same year that¬†	Max Planck¬†introduced quantization. 	He was five when Einstein published his theory of relativity. 	At the age of 19, while a student at the University of Munich, he was asked to write an encyclopedia article on

higher  energies.  A  thin  cadmium  sheet  is  therefore  used  for filtering  the  thermal  neutrons  out  of  the  complex  radiation  that  comes  out of  a  paraffin  block  containing  a  neutron  source  inside.
Some elements,  especially  cadmium,  have  their  characteristic  absorption  band  overlapping  with  the  absorption  in  the  thermal  region.  This  element  absorbs therefore  very  strongly  the  thermal  neutrons,  while  it  is  almost  transparent to  neutrons  of
before  reaching  the  ground  state.  The   Œ≥-rays  emitted  by this  process  were  investigated  by  Rasetti  and  by  Fleischmann.
All  the  processes  of  capture  of  slow  neutrons  by  any  nucleus  are  generally accompanied  by  the  emission  of  Œ≥-rays  :  Immediately  after  the  capture  of  the neutron,  the  nucleus  remains  in  a  state  of  high  excitation  and  emits  one  or more  Œ≥-quanta,
one  should  expect  the  intensity  of  the  activation  by  slow  neutrons  to  depend upon  the  temperature  of  the  paraffin.
reached  this lowest  limit  of  energy,  either  they  escape  by  diffusion  out  of  the  paraffin,  or are  captured  by  some  nucleus.  If  the  neutron  energy  reaches  the  thermal  value,
The  thermal  neutrons 	If  the  neutrons  could  go  on  indefinitely  diffusing  inside  the  paraffin,  their energy  would  evidently  reach  finally  a  mean  value  equal  to  that  of  thermal agitation.  It  is  possible,  however,  that,  before  the  neutrons  have
Before  discussing  this  point,  as well  as  the  dependence  of  the  capture  cross-section  on  the  energy  of  the neutrons  we  shall  first  consider  how  far  down  the  energy  of  the  primary neutrons  can  be  reduced  by  the  collisions  against  the  protons.
behaviour  of  different  elements  in  this  respect  is widely  different;  the  cross-section  for  the  capture  of  slow  neutrons  varies, with  no  apparent  regularity  for  different  elements,  from  about  10^-24 cm2 or  less,  to  about  a  thousand  times  as  much.
To  the  large  cross-section  for  the  capture  of  slow  neutrons  by  several atoms,  there  must  obviously  correspond  a  very  strong  absorption  of  these atoms  for  the  slow  neutrons.  We  investigated  systematically  such  absorptions,  and  found  that  the
thus  accounting  for  the  larger  intensities  of  activation  observed  when  irradiation  is  performed  inside  a  large  mass of  paraffin  or  water.
Both  theory  and  experiment  show  that  certain  types  of  neutron  reactions, and  especially  those  of  type  (3), occur  with  a  much  larger  cross-section  for slow  neutrons  than  for  fast  neutrons,
It  follows  that,  when  neutrons  of  high  energy  are  shot  by  a  source  inside  a  large  mass  of  paraffin  or  water,  they  very rapidly  lose  most  of  their  energy  and  are  transformed  into  "slow  neutrons".
it  can  be  shown  that  a neutron  having  an  initial  energy  of  10^6 volts,  after  about  20  impacts  against hydrogen  atoms  has  its  energy  already  reduced  to  a  value  close  to  that  corresponding  to  thermal  agitation.
The  neutron  and  the proton  having  approximately  the  same  mass,  any  elastic  impact  of  a  fast neutron  against  a  proton  initially  at  rest,  gives  rise  to  a  distribution  of  the available  kinetic  energy  between  neutron  and  proton;
A  similar  effect  is  produced  by  water,  and in  general  by  substances  containing  a  large  concentration  of  hydrogen.  Substances  not  containing  hydrogen  show  sometimes  similar  features,  though extremely  less  pronounced.
A  careful  investigation  of  these  effects  led  to  the unexpected  result  that  surrounding  both  source  and  body  to  be  activated with  masses  of  paraffin,  increases  in  some  cases  the  intensity  of  activation  by a  very  large  factor  (up  to  100).
The  slow  neutrons The  intensity  of  the  activation  as  a  function  of  the  distance  from  the  neutron source  shows  in  some  cases  anomalies  apparently  dependent  on  the  objects that  surround  the  source.
The  final  result  is  therefore  identical  with  the  products  obtained by  means  of  the  nuclear  photoeffect  (Bothe),  or  by  bombardment  with  fast deuterons.
does  not  remain  bound  in  the  nucleus,  but  knocks  off instead,  one  of  the  nuclear  neutrons  out  of  the  nucleus;  the  result  is  a  new nucleus,  that  is  isotopic  with  the  original  one  and  has  an  atomic  weight  less by  one  unit.
It  should  be  noticed  here,  that  besides  processes  (1),  (2),  and  (3)  for the  production  of  artificial  radioactivity  with  neutrons,  neutrons  of  sufficiently  high  energy  can  react  also  as  follows,  as  was  first  shown  by  Heyn: The  primary  neutron
*  The  discovery  by  Hahn  and  Strassmann  of  barium  among  the  disintegration  products of  bombarded  uranium,  as  a  consequence  of  a  process  in  which  uranium  splits  into two  approximately  equal  parts,  makes  it  necessary  to  reexamine  all  the  problems
It  is  known  that  O.  Hahn  and  L.  Meitner  have  investigated  very  carefully and  extensively  the  decay  products  of  irradiated  uranium,  and  were  able  to trace  among  them  elements  up  to  the  atomic  number  96.*
uranium  down  to  the  atomic  number  86.  We  concluded  that  the  carriers were  one  or  more  elements  of  atomic  number  larger  than  92  ;  we,  in  Rome,	use to call  the  elements  93  and  94  Ausenium  and  Hesperium  respectively.
We attempted,  since  the  spring  of  1934,  to  isolate  chemically  the  carriers  of  these activities,  with  the  result  that  the  carriers  of  some  of  the  activities  of  uranium are  neither  isotopes  of  uranium  itself,  nor  of  the  elements  lighter  than
Both  elements  show  a  rather  strong,  induced  activity  when  bombarded with  neutrons;  and  in  both  cases  the  decay  curve  of  the  induced  activity shows  that  several  active  bodies  with  different  mean  lives  are  produced.
that can  be  immediately  distinguished,  by  absorption,  from  the  Œ≤-activity  induced by  the  neutrons.
For  the  investigation of  these  elements  it  is  necessary  to  purify  first  the  element  as  thoroughly  as possible  from  the  daughter  substances  that  emit  Œ≤-particles.  When  thus  purified,  both  thorium  and  uranium  emit  spontaneously  only  Œ±-particles,
they  give  rise  to  an  exponentially  decaying  activity.  A  very  striking exception  to  this  behaviour  is  found  for  the  activities  induced  by  neutrons in  the  naturally  active  elements  thorium  and  uranium.
As  mentioned  before,  the  heavy  elements  usually  react  only  according to  process  (3)  and  therefore,  but  for  certain  complications  to  be  discussed later,  and  for  the  case  in  which  the  original  element  has  more  than  one  stable isotope,
and  Al (M=28)  with  a  period  of  2  to  3  minutes  by  process  (3).
For  instance,  neutron  bombardment  of  aluminium  that  has a  single  isotope Al (M=27),  gives  rise  to  three  radioactive  products:  	Na (M=24),  with  a half-period  of  15  hours  by  process  (1);  	Mg (M=27),  with  a  period  of  IO  minutes by  process  (2);
The  reactions  of  the  types  (1) and  (2)  occur  chiefly  among  the  light  elements,  	while  those  of  the  type  (3) are  found  very  often  also  for  heavy  elements.  		In  many  cases  the  three  processes  are  found  at  the  same  time  in  a single  element.

In most  cases  we  performed  also  a  chemical  analysis,  in  order  to  identify  the chemical  element  that  was  the  carrier  of  the  activity.  For  short  living  substances,  such  an  analysis  must  be  performed  very  quickly,  in  a  time  of  the order  of

This  number  is  of course  very  small  compared  to  the  yield  of  neutrons  that  can  be  obtained from  cyclotrons  or  from  high-voltage  tubes.  The  small  dimensions,  the  perfect  steadiness  and  the  utmost  simplicity  are,  however,  sometimes  very  useful
As  source  of  neutrons  in  these  researches  I  used  a  small  glass  bulb  containing  beryllium  powder  and  radon.  With  amounts  of  radon  up  to  800  millicuries  such  a  source  emits  about  2  x  10^7 neutrons  per  second.

without having  to  overcome  the  potential  barrier,  due  to the  Coulomb  field  that  surrounds  the  nucleus.		Furthermore,  since  neutrons practically  do  not  interact  with  electrons,  their  range  is  very  long,  and  the probability  of  a  nuclear  collision  is
Indeed  neutrons  are  emitted  as  products  of nuclear  reactions,  whose yield  is  only  seldom  larger  than  10^-4.  This  drawback  is,  however,  compensated  by  the  fact  that  neutrons,  having  no  electric  charge,  can  reach  the nuclei  of  all  atoms,
the  effects  of  the  bombardment  with  neutrons.		Compared  with  Œ±-particles,  the  neutrons  have  the  obvious  drawback  that the  available  neutron  sources  emit  only  a  comparatively  small  number  of neutrons.
Immediately  after  these  discoveries,  it  appeared  that  Œ±-particles  very  likely did  not  represent  the  only  type  of  bombarding  projectiles  for  producing artificial  radioactivity.  I  decided  therefore  to  investigate  from  this  point  of view

As an aid in this investigation, Fermi served as a consultant in the design of the University's synchrocyclotron.

that the slow neutrons had a much more powerful effect than the fast neutrons. It was further found that the strongest effect was achieved at a certain speed,
when the rays were allowed to pass through water or paraffin. Minute study of this phenomenon showed that the speed of the neutrons was slowed down on impact with the hydrogen nuclei which were present in these substances. Contrary to what one had reasons to believe, it appeared
It was some six months after their first experiment with neutron irradiation that Fermi and his co-workers came by chance on a new discovery which proved to be of the greatest importance. They observed namely that the effect of neutron irradiation was often extremely increased,

neutron speeds that can be obtained by present methods, there is no ejection of any material part. The surplus energy disappears in the form of electromagnetic radiations (gamma-radiations). As there is no variation in the charge, an isotope is obtained of the initial substance.
When using neutrons as projectiles, these are captured in the nucleus. In the case of the lighter elements, a hydrogen nucleus or a helium nucleus is ejected instead. With the heavier elements, however, the forces that interlink the atomic parts are so strong that, at least with
Today, neutrons are artificially produced by bombarding beryllium or lithium with heavy-hydrogen nuclei, whereby these substances emit neutrons with high energy. The neutron beams so produced are particularly powerful.

The neutron being uncharged continues on its course without suffering any hindrance until it is stopped by direct impact on a nucleus. As the dimensions of the nuclei are extremely small compared with the distances that

it was given to one of his pupils,¬†Chadwick, to find the neutron in the extremely strong radiation given off by beryllium subjected to the effect of a radioactive substance. 	The neutron has qualities that make it particularly suitable as a projectile in atomic fission.
We have earlier spoken of the neutron as one of the two building-stones in atom nuclei. The existence of the neutron is however only a recent discovery. Rutherford had suspected the existence of a heavy particle without electric charge and had even given it the name neutron;
It was granted to today‚Äôs Nobel Prize winner, Professor Fermi, to succeed in shattering even the heavier and the heaviest elements in the Periodic System.		Fermi used neutrons as projectiles in his experiments.

not the ordinary oxygen atom, an atom that has eight neutrons in the nucleus, but an oxygen atom with nine neutrons. This meant that an oxygen isotope had been obtained. This occurs in nature, although rarely; among 12,500 ordinary oxygen atoms, one oxygen isotope is found.
a hydrogen nucleus is ejected from the former, and that the rests together with the captured helium nucleus form an oxygen nucleus.¬†	By this means helium and nitrogen were thus changed into oxygen and hydrogen. The atom of oxygen that was obtained by this method was however
heavy-helium nuclei that are thrown off at great speed by the natural radioactive substances, to split atoms. He met with success in several cases. For the sake of example, we will be content to mention that if a nitrogen nucleus has been struck by the bombarding helium nuclei,
As the idea of immutability of the atoms of the elements had to be abandoned, one was back at the age-old problem of the alchemists, the transmutation of the elements.¬†	Lord Rutherford¬†was the first to put forward the idea that it would be possible, with the help of the
four and a half thousand million years. For radium, the corresponding length of time would be one thousand six hundred years. Other radioactive materials would by contrast only take seconds or days for half of the number of atoms to disintegrate.
It must be noted in this respect that however strong the effect of a substance that is radioactive, it is in many instances only a very small part of the number of atoms that disintegrates. Thus, for a half of the number of uranium atoms to disintegrate, it would take
that which comes from actinium has 125. So we have three isotopes of lead. Lead as found in nature is usually a mixture of these three types.
last-named elements is lead also. However, the lead obtained in these three series is not identical, in so far as the number of constituent neutrons is concerned. The lead that comes from the uranium has 124 neutrons in the nucleus, that which comes from thorium has 126 and
Soon after the radioactivity of uranium was discovered, it was established that this same characteristic occurred in another element, thorium, and later it appeared that this was also the case with the element called actinium. The end-product of the disintegration of these two
Among the substances included in this chain, there is the highly radioactive substance radium, which¬†Madame Curie discovered and succeeded in producing.
from the uranium atoms. Thus, when one part of the uranium nuclei disintegrates explosively, new substances are formed that disintegrate in their turn, giving off radiations, and so on, until a final stable product is formed which is found to be lead.
There was thus great sensation when the Frenchman¬†Becquerel, in 1892, discovered that the element uranium distintegrated giving off strong radiation. 	Research on this radiation proved that it consisted among others of the helium nuclei that were emitted at very high speed
After all the fruitless attempts at the transmutation of one element into another, the firm conviction grew last century that the different atoms, 92 in number, were indestructible and immutable units of the structure of matter.
have received the name of¬†isotopes. As an example of an isotope, we can cite the heavy-hydrogen atom discovered by Urey which is a constituent of so-called heavy water. There exist hydrogen isotopes with one or two neutrons in the nucleus.
Meanwhile, it has been found that the nucleus of an atom can contain a number of neutrons less than or in excess of the normal. These atoms, that present the same physical and chemical qualities as the normal atom except that the weight is different,
The atoms are numbered according to the number of protons, or unit charges in the nucleus, with hydrogen as number 1 and uranium as number 92, which is the heaviest element known to date.
A proton is nothing but the nucleus of the lightest atom, i.e. hydrogen.		A helium nucleus has two protons and two neutrons; 		the atom of carbon has six protons and six neutrons, and so on.

As an aid in this investigation, Fermi served as a consultant in the design of the University's synchrocyclotron.
After that, he continued his investigations of the nucleus of the atom, concentrating on the nature of the particles that make up the nucleus. 		Particular emphasis in his investigations was placed upon the short-lived nuclear particles known as mesons.
At the war's end, when the University of Chicago decided to keep together the nucleus of the scientists who had worked in the Metallurgical Laboratory on the campus on the development of the bomb, Fermi joined the staff of the newly-founded "Institute for Nuclear Studies."
"On December 2, 1942, man achieved here the first self-sustaining chain reaction and thereby initiated the controlled release of nuclear energy."
Site of Chain Reaction		The site on the University of Chicago campus where Fermi and his colleagues achieved the first nuclear chain reaction today is marked by a sculpture by Henry Moore titled: "nuclear energy." 		Nearby stands a plaque which reads, simply:
For his bomb work, President Harry S. Truman presented him on March 20, 1945, with a Medal of Merit
University of Chicago, Fermi was placed in charge of building the first atomic pile in the squash court under the west stands of the University's Stagg Field. 		Later he was transferred to Los Alamos, New Mexico, as chief of the advanced physics department.
At U Chicago		Unsuccessful in negotiating for support at first, Fermi and other scientists persisted. The project began which was to become the Manhattan Engineering District and produce the first atomic bomb. Working first at Columbia and then transferred to the
nuclear fission had actually taken place. As a result, Fermi was chosen by his colleagues to go to Washington, D.C., to interest United States government officials in the possibility of building a nuclear weapon by means of a controllable nuclear fission.
Professor at Columbia		Fermi came to the United States and accepted a position as a professor of physics at Columbia University. By this time, the work of Fermi had been duplicated in other laboratories and theoretical analysis of the results had indicated that
Fermi used the opportunity offered by the trip to Sweden to receive the Nobel Prize to leave Italy. He and his family, which included a daughter, Nella, and a son Giulio, had grown increasingly restive under the .. regime.
First Atomic Pile		Both of these studies of Fermi's were essential precursors of the eventual work that led to the building of the first atomic pile and the first controlled release of nuclear energy.		These studies led to Fermi's receiving the award of the Nobel Prize in 1938.
The status of the patent was not clarified until 1953, when the Atomic Energy Commission awarded the inventors the relatively nominal sum of $300,000.
At that time, Fermi and the members of his group obtained an Italian patent on this method. The patent rights were assigned to a friend, G. M. Giannini, in the United States, who applied for an American patent. The latter was granted, after a five-year delay, in 1940.
Increased Radioactivity		In a second series of experiments with neutron bombardment, Fermi and his associates discovered that by passing neutrons through other elements they could be slowed down and the amount of artificial radioactivity they produced could be greatly increased.
Actually, they had not produced a new element, but, as later analysis showed, they had split the uranium atoms.
In their first report, produced in May, 1934, they did not claim the discovery of a new element, but rather related what indications they had found that such an element might be produced.
bombardment. 	When at last they came to uranium, then the heaviest known element, they found that more than one element was produced by the bombardment, and that at least one of the radioactive products seemed to be none of the existing elements close to uranium.
With extremely simple equipment, Fermi began systematically bombarding the elements in the periodic table, beginning with the lightest element and moving up to the heavier elements. In the process, Fermi and his associates analyzed the chemical end products of the neutron

In 1934, Fermi initiated the studies that led to his winning of the Nobel Prize. In that year, he began to bombard atomic nuclei with neutrons. The neutrons were provided by small amounts of the gas radon (produced by radium) mixed with beryllium powder. The radioactive gas
Although known today primarily as "a leading nuclear physicist, Fermi also made major contributions to the statistics of electron gas, the statistical model of the atom itself, and fundamental contributions to an understanding of radioactivity.

This assumption was to play an important part in the elaboration of Fermi‚Äôs theory. That this assumption was made was very natural, not least in view of the mentioned theory of Dirac, according to which it looked as if the electrons, the best known elementary particles,

ABSTRACT		This paper presents a simple model for such processes as spin diffusion or conduction in the "impurity band." These processes involve transport in a lattice which is in some sense random, and in them diffusion is expected to take place via quantum jumps between

The electric properties of crystals are described by the so-called band theory which gives a classification with respect to the conductivity in metals, semiconductors, and insulators. This theory is not universally valid, however, and a famous exception is provided by
It was Mott who several years later called the attention of particularly the expert mental physicists to this paper, which has become one of the cornerstones in our understanding of, among other things, the electric conductivity in disordered systems.
In 1958, Anderson published a paper in which he showed under what conditions an electron in a disordered system can either move through the system as a whole, or be more or less tied to a specific position as a localized electron.
either so that the components of an alloy are placed at random in the regular lattice positions, or so that there is no lattice whatsoever as for instance in glass. It is exceedingly difficult to treat such materials theoretically.
Mott and Anderson have separately given essential contributions to our knowledge of disordered systems. In crystallic materials, the atoms form regular lattices, which greatly facilitate the theoretical treatment. In disordered materials, this regularity is lacking ‚Äì
whereas the technical development of amorphous materials like glass, which is now going on, would be unthinkable without Mott‚Äôs and Anderson‚Äôs contributions to the fundamental theory.

Abstract		Localization of stationary waves occurs in a large variety of vibrating systems, whether mechanical, acoustical, optical, or quantum. It is induced by the presence of an inhomogeneous medium, a complex geometry, or a quenched disorder.

geometry and material a wave is moving through and uses it to draw the boundaries of localization. Previous efforts to pinpoint localized waves had failed due to the complexity of considering all possible waves,
Over the next three years they found that the two phenomena were indeed related. In a¬†2012 paper, Filoche and Mayboroda introduced a way to mathematically perceive the terrain the way a wave would see it. The resulting ‚Äúlandscape‚Äù function interprets information about the
After Mayboroda‚Äôs talk, the two started speculating whether the irregular bulging patterns in Mayboroda‚Äôs plates might be related to the way Filoche‚Äôs vibrations localized in some places and disappeared in others.
Filoche was in the audience. He had spent more than a decade studying the localization of vibrations, and his research had led to the construction of a¬†prototype noise-abating barrier¬†called ‚ÄúFractal Wall‚Äù for use along highways.
‚Äî bulging out in unexpected places, while remaining almost flat in others.
The Lay of the Landscape		In 2009 Mayboroda went to France and presented research she‚Äôd been doing on the mathematics of thin plates. She explained that when the plates have a complicated shape, and you apply some pressure from one side, the plates may flex in very irregular ways
She came up with a mathematical formula called the ‚Äúlandscape function‚Äù that predicts exactly where waves will localize and what form they‚Äôll take when they do.
This is where¬†Svitlana Mayboroda comes in. Mayboroda, 36, is a mathematician at the University of Minnesota. Five years ago, she began to untangle the long-standing puzzle of localization.
Even after Anderson‚Äôs discovery, much about localization remained mysterious. Although researchers were able to prove that localization does indeed occur, they had a very limited ability to predict when and where it might happen.
He studied the phenomenon in the context of electrons moving through impure materials (electrons behave as both particles and waves), but under certain circumstances it can happen with other types of waves as well.
Anderson won the 1977 Nobel Prize in physics for his discovery of what is now called Anderson localization, a term that refers to waves that stay in some ‚Äúlocal‚Äù region rather than propagating the way you‚Äôd expect.
In the 1950s, Philip Anderson, a physicist at Bell Laboratories, discovered a strange phenomenon. In some situations where it seems as though waves should advance freely, they just stop ‚Äî like a tsunami halting in the middle of the ocean.

most powerful accelerator for this purpose. He also needed to figure out in what way the new lepton might reveal its presence. There were few leads, however, and great inventiveness was required to design an experiment that would accomplish this.
The difficulties of experimentally proving the existence of such a heavy lepton also seemed almost insurmountable.	At Stanford, Martin Perl planned an experiment that might possibly resolve the matter. He needed a sufficiently strong energy source, and Stanford had the world‚Äôs
The idea that there might be a third, extremely heavy relative of the electron emerged during the 1960s, but such a particle fell outside the theoretical framework accepted at that time.
Second was the newly discovered neutrino. Third was the muon, a heavier version of the electron and the odd man out among elementary particles. No quarks had entered the picture yet.
After an unsuccessful trial, they devised a modified experiment that yielded favorable indications. A couple of years later, their findings were unequivocal.¬†	There were now three known leptons. First was the electron, which had been discovered as early as 1897.
Reines realized that a nuclear reactor must emit copious quantities of neutrinos, although no one had noticed them before. During the 1950s he and Cowan developed a method for capturing at least a few of these elusive sub atomic particles.

Together with the late C.L. Cowan, Frederick Reines detected the neutrino, the sister lepton of the electron in the first quark-lepton family, even before the family concept had emerged. It was a long-awaited discovery. For nearly 25 years, physicists had been waiting for

In 1928 Paul Dirac formulated a fully relativistic quantum theory. The equation gave solutions that he interpreted as being caused by a particle equivalent to the electron, but with a positive charge. This particle, the positron, was later confirmed through experiments.
During the intense period of 1925-26 quantum theories were proposed that accurately described the energy levels of electrons in atoms. These equations needed to be adapted to Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, however.

Because it transforms trivially in the Standard Model, it does not interact with anything except perhaps the Higgs. The right-handed neutrino certainly improves the aesthetics of the SU(5) theory.	More importantly, there is increasing indirect evidence from experimental particle
dim(F ‚äïF‚àó)=2^5 =32	With the binary code interpretation, it could not be any other way. In actuality, however, the existence of a right-handed neutrino (or its antiparticle, the left-handed antineutrino) has been controversial.

This theory appeared in a 1974 paper by Georgi [10], shortly after his paper with Glashow on the SU(5) theory. However, Georgi has said that he conceived of the Spin(10) theory first. See Zee [40], Chapter VII.7, for a concise and readable account. The SU(5) GUT has helped us
3.2. The Spin(10) theory. We now turn our attention to another grand unified theory. Physicists call it the ‚ÄúSO(10) theory‚Äù, but we shall call it the Spin(10) theory, because the Lie group involved is really Spin(10), the double cover of SO(10).
on proton lifetime [26]. Nevertheless, because of its prototypical status and intrinsic interest, we simply must talk about the SU(5) theory.
In this section, we will limit our attention to the nonsupersymmetric version of SU(5) theory, which is how it was originally proposed. Unfortunately, this theory has since been ruled out by experiment; it predicts that protons will decay faster than the current lower bound
can be found in a review article by Witten [39], which also discusses the supersymmetric generalization of this theory.
It was the first grand unified theory and is still considered the prototypical example. As such, there are many accounts of it in the physics literature. The textbooks by Ross [31] and Mohapatra [21] both devote an entire chapter to the SU(5) theory, and a lucid summary
Why are there the same number of quarks and leptons? GUTs can shed light on these questions, using only group representation theory.		3.1. The SU(5) GUT. The SU(5) grand unified theory appeared in a 1974 paper by Howard Georgi and Sheldon Glashow [12].
Why do both leptons and quarks come in left-and right-handed varieties, which transform so differently? Why do quarks come in charges which are in units 1/3 times an electron‚Äôs charge?
Amazingly, this beauty then becomes a part of the physics. The representation of GSM used in the Standard Model seems ad hoc. Why this one? Why are all those seemingly arbitrary hypercharges floating around, mucking up some otherwise simple representations?
might be like, but so far there is no empirical evidence that any GUT is correct‚Äîand even some empirical evidence that some GUTs, like SU(5), are incorrect.
It is also, therefore, an attempt to describe the physics at higher energies.	GUTs are speculative physics. The Standard Model has been tested in countless experiments. There is a lot of evidence that it is an incomplete theory, and some vague clues about what the next theory
A grand unified theory, or GUT, constitutes a guess at what these ‚Äúmore symmetric‚Äù laws might be. It is a theory with more symmetry than the Standard Model, which reduces to the Standard Model at lower energies.
that some and perhaps all of them are massive. This allows them to change back and forth from one type to another, a phenomenon called ‚Äúneutrino oscillation‚Äù.	.	No one knows why the Standard Model is this redundant, with three sets of very similar particles. It remains a mystery.
The second and third generations of quarks and charged leptons differ from the first by being more massive and able to decay into particles of the earlier generations. The various neutrinos do not decay, and for a long time it was thought they were massless, but now it is known

In Section 3.3, we will learn about the Pati‚ÄìSalam model, which explains this pattern by unifying quarks and leptons. Today, we know about three generations of fermions. Three of quarks:
Much later, in the 1970s, physicists realized there was also a second generation of quarks: the charm quark, c,and the strange quark, s. This was evidence of another pattern in the Standard Model: there are as many flavors of quark as there are leptons.
The muon decays via the weak force into an electron, a muon neutrino, and an electron antineutrino: 	Œº‚àí ‚Üíe‚àí+ŒΩŒº+ŒΩ^e.
the neutrino we have been discussing so far is now called the electron neutrino, ŒΩe, to distinguish it from the muon neutrino, ŒΩŒº. Together, the muon and the muon neutrino comprise the second generation of leptons.
As the physicist Rabi quipped at the time: ‚ÄúWho ordered that?‚Äù Dubbed the muon and denoted Œº‚àí, this new particle turned out to act like an overweight electron. Like the electron, it feels only the electromagnetic and weak force‚Äîand like the electron, it has its own neutrino! So,
At first researchers thought it was the particle predicted by Yukawa‚Äîthe one that mediates the strong force between nucleons. But then it turned out the newly discovered particle was not affected by the strong force. This came as a complete surprise.
Yet we would be derelict in our duty if we did not mention the second and third generation of fermions. The first evidence for these came in the 1930s, when a charged particle 207 times as heavy as the electron was found.
The Standard Model has this gauge group: 	GSM =U(1)√óSU(2)√óSU(3).
Gauge Bosons 	Force          Gauge Boson  Symbol Electromagnetism Photon   Œ≥ 	Weak force   W and Z bosons W+, W‚àí and Z 	Strong force Gluons             g
The quarks interact by the exchange of gluons, the gauge bosons of the strong force.	The gluons are fundamental particles, gauge bosons of the strong force, and they complete our table of gauge bosons:
The picture is simpler than that of electromagnetism and the weak force, however, because this symmetry is ‚Äúunbroken‚Äù.
The force between nucleons is a side effect of these more fundamental interactions among quarks. Like all three forces in the Standard Model, the strong force is explained by a gauge theory, this time with gauge group SU(3), the color symmetry group of the quarks.
Now we need a force to keep quarks together inside the nucleons, and quark confinement tells us it must be a very strong force indeed. It is this force that, in modern parlance, is called the strong force and is considered fundamental.
2.3.4. Color and SU(3). There is one more fundamental force in the Standard Model: the strong force. We have already met this force, as the force that keeps the nucleus together, but we discussed it before we knew that protons and neutrons are made of quarks.
For the details on symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism, which is essential to understanding the Standard Model, see Huang [17]. For a quick overview, see Zee [40].

the photon and the W and Z bosons, interact with a particle called the ‚ÄúHiggs boson‚Äù, and it is their differing interactions with this particle that makes them appear so different at low energies. The Higgs boson has yet to be observed and remains one of the most mysterious parts
The dynamics behind symmetry breaking are beyond the scope of this paper. We will just mention that, in the Standard Model, electroweak symmetry breaking is believed to be due to the ‚ÄúHiggs mechanism‚Äù. In this mechanism, all particles in the Standard Model, including
In particular, even if they do exist, we know very little about them. 	In a weak process such as neutron decay 	udd ‚Üíuud+e‚àí+ŒΩ,
For a long time, physicists believed this particle did not even exist, but recent observations of neutrino oscillations suggest otherwise. In this paper, we will assume there are right-handed neutrinos, but the reader should be aware that this is still open to some debate.
Why the weak force, and only the weak force, exhibits this behavior is a mystery. Since neutrinos only feel the weak force, and the weak force only involves left-handed particles, the right-handed neutrino ŒΩR has never been observed directly.
This fact about the weak force, first noticed in the 1950s, left a deep impression on physicists. 	No other physical law is asymmetric in left and right.	That is, no other physics, classical or quantum, looks different when viewed in a mirror.
and similarly for right-handed fermions, which we will denote with a subscript R.	Remarkably, the weak force interacts only with left-handed particles and right-handed antiparticles. For example, when the neutron decays, we always have 	nL ‚ÜípL+e‚àíL+ŒΩ^R and never 	nR ‚ÜípR+e‚àíR+ŒΩL
There are are left-handed leptons, which we denote as 	ŒΩL e‚àíL and 	left-handed quarks, which we denote as 	uL dL
The weak force cares about the ‚Äúhandedness‚Äù of particles. It seems that every particle that we have discussed comes in left-and right-handed varieties, which (quite roughly speaking) spin in opposite ways.
In fact, the neutrino only interacts via the weak force. Like the electromagnetic force and the strong force, the weak force is a fundamental force, hypothesized to explain the decay of the neutron, and eventually required to explain other phenomena.
They interact very weakly with other particles, so weakly that they were not observed until the 1950s, over 20 years after they were hypothesized by Pauli. 	Collectively, neutrinos and electrons, the fundamental fermions that do not feel the strong force, are called leptons.
Neutrinos are particles which show up in certain interactions, such as the decay of a neutron into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino n ‚Üíp + e‚àí + ŒΩ^		‚Äúantielectron‚Äù is called a positron.		Neutrinos carry no charge and no color.

2.2.2. Leptons. With the quarks and electron, we have met all the fundamental fermions required to make atoms, and almost all of the particles we need to discuss the Standard Model. 	Only one player remains to be introduced: the neutrino, ŒΩ.
Confinement amounts to the following decree: all observed states must be white, i.e., invariant under the action of SU(3). It turns out that this has many consequences.
where C2 is spanned by the flavors u and d. 	Put another way, a first-generation quark comes in one of six flavor-color states. 	How could physicists discover the concept of color, given that quarks are confined? In fact, confinement was the key to this discovery!
The group SU(3) acts on each space. All six quarks taken together span this vector space: 	C3 ‚äï C3 ~= C2 ‚äó C3
Since both up and down quarks come in three color states, there are really six kinds of quarks in the matter we see around us. 	Three up quarks, spanning a copy of C3: ur,ug,ub ‚àà C3. and 	three down quarks, spanning another copy of C3: dr,dg,db ‚àà C3.
the names are quite well chosen. Mathematically, all that matters is that the Hilbert space for a single quark is C3; we call the standard basis vectors r, g and b.The color symmetry group SU(3) acts on this Hilbert space in the obvious way, via its fundamental representation.
It is especially impressive how physicists were able to discover that each flavor of quark comes in three different states, called colors: red r, green g,and blue b. 	These ‚Äúcolors‚Äù have nothing to do with actual colors; they are just cute names‚Äî though as we shall see,
Unfortunately, we do not have space for this history here, but it can be found in the books by Crease and Mann [8], Segr`e [33], and Pais [25].
They are always bunched up into particles such as the proton and neutron. 	This phenomenon is called confinement. 	It makes the long, convoluted history of how we came to understand quarks, despite the fact that they are never seen, all the more fascinating.
They are all we need to make protons and neutrons, and so, with the electron in tow, the above list contains all the particles we need to make atoms.	Yet quarks, fundamental as they are, are never seen in isolation.

These two conditions are enough to determine the charge of their constituents, which are fundamental fermions much like the electron:
The proton consists of two up quarks and one down: p =uud while the neutron consists of one up quark and two down: n =udd 		Protons have an electric charge of +1, exactly opposite the electron, while neutrons are neutral, with 0 charge.
There are a number of different types of quarks, called flavors. However, it takes only two flavors to make protons and neutrons: the up quark, u,and the down quark, d.
it was based on the idea that the proton, neutron and pions were all fundamental particles without internal structure, which was not ultimately supported by the evidence. 	Protons and neutrons are not fundamental. They are made of particles called quarks.
2.2. The fundamental fermions. 2.2.1. Quarks. In the last section, we learned how Heisenberg unified the proton and neutron into the nucleon, and that Yukawa proposed that nucleons interact by exchanging pions. This viewpoint turned out to be at least approximately true, but
It was called the pion and it came in three varieties: one with positive charge, the œÄ+, one neutral, the œÄ0, and one with negative charge, the œÄ‚àí.
Partially because of the intervention of World War II, it took over ten years for Yukawa‚Äôs prediction to be vindicated. After a famous false alarm, it became clear by 1947 that a particle with the expected properties had been found.
this particle should be about 200 times as massive as the electron, or about a tenth the mass of a proton. He predicted that experimentalists would find a particle with a mass in this range, and that it would interact strongly when it collided with nuclei.
In the early 1930s, he predicted the existence of a particle that mediates the strong force, much as the photon mediates the electromagnetic force. From known properties of the strong force, he was able to predict that
.. there must be a mechanism which can convert protons into neutrons and vice versa. Mathematically, we have a way to do this: the action of SU(2). What does this correspond to, physically? The answer originates in the work of Hideki Yukawa.
These symmetries hold for the strong force, but not for electromagnetism: we say this force ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù SU(2) symmetry.
electromagnetic effects. One can phrase this idea in terms of group representation theory as follows: 		The strong force is invariant under the action of SU(2). 		Though this idea was later seen to be an oversimplification, it foreshadowed modern ideas about unification.

To hold these particles so closely together, physicists hypothesized a new force, the strong force, strong enough to overcome the electric repulsion of the protons. It must be strongest only at short distances (about 10^‚àí15 m), and then it must fall off rapidly,

Crease and Mann [8] give a very readable introduction. 	To dig deeper, try the book by Segr`e [33], or 	the still more detailed treatments by Pais [25] and Hoddeson et al. [16].
Finally, few things are more enjoyable than the history of nuclear and particle physics, a romantic tale full of heroic figures and tightly linked to 	the dark drama of World War II, 	the Manhattan Project, 	and the ensuing Cold War.
The quantum field theory texts mentioned above also discuss gauge theory, but in language less familiar to mathematicians.
Naber‚Äôs books are a great place to start [22, 23], and one of us has also written an elementary introduction [3]. 	Isham‚Äôs text is elegant and concise [18], and many people swear by Nakahara [24].
Particle physics also relies heavily on geometry, especially gauge theory. 	This subject is easier to develop in a rigorous way, so there are plenty of texts that describe the applications to physics, but which a mathematician can easily understand.
but anyone serious about this subject should quickly accept the fact that quantum field	theory has not been made rigorous: this is a project for the century to come.
Srednicki‚Äôs text [35] is clear	about many details that other books gloss over, and it costs nothing! Of course, these books are geared toward physicists: mathematicians may find the lack of rigor frustrating. Ticciati [37] provides a nice introduction for mathematicians,
Many physicists consider the books by Brown [5] and Ryder [32] to be the most approachable.	The text by Peskin and Schroeder [30] offers a lot of physical insight, and we have also found Zee‚Äôs book [40] very useful in this respect.
Particle physics relies heavily on quantum field theory. There are many books on this subject, none of which make it easy. Prerequisites include a good understanding of classical mechanics, classical field theory and quantum mechanics.
For more information on grand unified theories, see the textbooks by Ross [31] and Mohapatra [21].
Sudbery‚Äôs text specially designed for mathematicians [36]. 	The book by Huang [17] delves as	deep as one can go into the Standard Model without a heavy dose of quantum field theory, and the book by Lee [19] is full of practical wisdom.
For the interested reader, there are many introductions to particle physics where one can learn the dynamics after getting a taste of the algebra here.	It might be good to start by reading Griffiths‚Äô introductory book [13] together with
to particle physics. 	To see the subject more through the eyes of a physicist, try the books by Lipkin [20] or Tinkham [38]. 	Georgi‚Äôs text [11] shows how the subject looks to one of the inventors of grand unified theories.
https://t.co/it0dl7v7Bq	..	There are countless books on Lie groups, Lie algebras and their representations, but the text by Hall [14] has everything we need, and more. 	Sternberg‚Äôs introduction to group theory and physics [34] includes an excellent account of applications
This allows us to reduce the prerequisites to a bare minimum while still giving a taste of the profound puzzles that physicists are struggling to solve.
In this expository account for mathematicians, we explain only the portion of these theories that involves finite-dimensional group representations.

Abstract	¬†	The Standard Model is the best tested and most widely accepted theory of elementary particles we have today. It may seem complicated and arbitrary, but it has hidden patterns that are revealed by the relationship between three "grand unified theories" :

Unsolved problem in physics:		Are the three forces of the Standard Model unified at high energies? By which symmetry is this unification governed? Can Grand Unification explain the number of fermion generations and their masses?

Even Einstein, after having success, with the confidence that success brings, may fail to succeed in scientific discovery for an awful amount of prolonged time.

So enjoy media like Twitter while it lasts, or use it effectively to help bring the world to a more equitable and just international laws before the doors across borders get shut soon. This is why I believe some governments and power houses are currently racing at global scale.
older national dynamics. You probably noticed the increase in national regulations of blockchain and related crypto currencies. The same  path awaits global only reach apps like Twitter. Censorship, goverment control of media, all the old problems will be there, unfortunately.
it is a messy problem when the sharing is public, which currently means global. For a platform like Twitter, global is the only option. So I think in the future we will decease to enjoy the global reach as offered by e.g. Twitter, public will mean national, and we will be back to
Wpedia in Turkey. The balance between freedom of information and obiding by the laws of goverments is a tough one. 	I think private vs public distinction is the key, applied by FB with some success. FB and government and any 3rd party should be out when I am sharing privately,
The real question who is to regulate? EU jump started with GDPR, US is now preparing its own. Soon every country will have their own regulations. How are FBs of the world to deal with such dicrepant laws and when they cannot, what is the recourse, shutdown? Like Google in China.
can reach out to whole world for influence, bad. 	Some regulation is necessary, but then who is to regulate? Certainly not FB or any of the social media platforms, they should implement mechanisms for compliance and comply (messy job).
Welcome to the messy democracy, yes any narrative can go viral, yes any government or power house can push their view for influence.

when there is a solution, and will increase if reacted irresponsibly. Blaming language after such a hineous attack is not responsible. Tactical moves to punish communities are not responsible. Reporting on facts without blaming is responsible and necessary.

That is, Citgo is the main buyer of crude oil to PDVSA and now, after the sanctions issued on January 28, it will not be able to continue acquiring Venezuelan crude.
Today, from the total oil exports to the US, at least 200,000 barrels per day are bought by¬†Citgo¬†, which then refines and distributes them in fuel along the eastern coast of the United States.
India supplies Venezuela with petroleum products and, soon, with medicines and food in exchange for oil,¬†according to the Minister of Petroleum, Manuel Quevedo¬†.
Currently it is located at $ 25,000 million, the¬†Ecoanal√≠tica¬†firm calculates¬†, and it is also canceled with oil shipments.
Russia is, along with China, one of the main creditors of the Government of Maduro.¬†And, to pay the debts, PDVSA sends oil to that country.	The total debt with the Asian country reached 60,000 million dollars during the governments of the deceased president Hugo Ch√°vez.
During 2018 Venezuelan crude oil exports to that country represented, on average, 500,000 barrels per day,¬†according to the Energy Information Administration¬†.
Venezuelan oil exports are directed mainly to four countries: the United States, Russia, China and India.		The purchases made by the US are those that generate the highest¬†cash flowto the state¬†PDVSA¬†.
This is because in 2017 an¬†executive order of¬†the Government of Donald Trump prohibited natural persons and legal entities from participating in the purchase or sale of¬†bonds¬†issued by the¬†Venezuelan State¬†and the national oil company.
Not only is it the main buyer of¬†Venezuelan oil¬†, but 100% of the company's shares are under the management of¬†Pdvsa¬†, its parent company.	However,¬†US financial sanctions¬†also made it impossible to send dividends from Citgo to PDVSA.
In addition,¬†according to its website¬†, it has under its ownership an approximate of 6,000 service stations distributed throughout the country.¬†This makes¬†Citgothe fifth largest supplier of refined and tradable products in the United States.
The oil subsidiary in the¬†United States¬†has an installed capacity to process 749,000 barrels per day of crude oil and has three¬†refineries¬†in the North American territory: one in Texas;¬†another in Louisiana;¬†and in Illinois.
Additionally,¬†the¬†United States¬†Treasury Department¬†prohibited oil purchases from PDVSA¬†;¬†as well as the Venezuelan state sales of supplies and derivative products.
This is the main subsidiary of Petr√≥leos de Venezuela (¬†Pdvsa¬†) abroad and maximum buyer of crude oil in the country.

The US pulled out of the 47-member UN Human Rights Council in June 2018, and cut its funding to the organization in August, partly due to what Washington called the UNHRC‚Äôs¬†‚Äúunrelenting bias‚Äù against Israel.		Israel is not a member of the council.

The death ratio is precisely what you get when you have a resource-poor, desperate occupied group up against one of the world‚Äôs most powerful militaries.
Israel has the most powerful military in the Middle East. The chief Palestinian resistance weapon is a rock, though in Gaza sometimes they fire rockets (which are more like glorified fireworks than sophisticated pieces of military hardware) or set fire to kites.
In Operation Protective Edge alone, which took place during the summer of 2014, the Israeli Defense Forces killed over 1,400 civilians in Gaza, of those about 550 were children,¬†according to the United Nations.¬†Six civilians in Israel were killed. Why the discrepancy?

But this is not to say, as blind supporters of Israel often do, that Israel had ended its occupation of Gaza. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert later¬†clarified¬†the nature of Israel‚Äôs relationship to Gaza: ‚ÄúWe will operate, enter and pull out as needed.‚Äù Despite protestations to the

automatic retargetability to new ASIP architectures. The compiler supports C (optionally extended with user-defined data types and operators using C++ classes and function overloading), C++, and OpenCL C (OpenCL kernel language).
Unique compiler-in-the-loop technology, enabled by the automatic generation of a comprehensive software development kit (SDK) for each ASIP modeled in nML, containing the following components:¬†	An optimizing compiler, recognized for its efficient code generation and quick and
Also, with nML the ASIP‚Äôs periphery can be modeled in a cycle- and bit-accurate way. nML offers unprecedented architectural breadth, enabling IP development for almost any vertical market.
Modeling of ASIP instruction-set architectures in the nML processor description language which is a high-level definition language for describing a processor architecture and instruction set (ISA).nML offers designers the abstraction level of a programmer's manual of a processor.
Key capabilities include rapid exploration of architectural choices, generation of an efficient C/C++ -compiler based software development kit that automatically adapts to every architectural change, and automatic generation of power and area-optimized synthesizable RTL.
Yet ASIPs retain software programmability within their application domain, resulting in C/C++-programmable processors and accelerators with the lowest power possible.
Application-specific instruction-set processors (ASIPs) rely on similar techniques as used in the design of hardware accelerators to achieve high performance and low power: heavy use of parallelism and specialized datapath elements. https://t.co/rD8MI4Futh

That is the only way the new life will forget and forgive you. Unless you want the new life to live the life of a slave; afraid, scared, under-developed, and abused. No human will allow this.
If you insist otherwise, you disrespected your old love, you continued to abuse the new life. No souls will be at rest until you come to your senses and let the new life be free and continue to enjoy the sealed love. You can only hope to make it up by letting go, setting free.
and only caring about the new life? Well, you lost that priviledge as the new life went through the motions of your desertion, and your unthinkable abuse. You should seek forgiveness and get out of the way, only be there if the new life desires to see you or seek your care.
Even if the new life is too young or under-developed, you still need to let the new life enjoy growing with your old love as the seal of love for them is still tight. This might hurt you a lot, but remember you are the one to go after new love. The new love faded too quickly
When love gives birth to any life, set aside all your insecurities, fallacies, unmet desires, for the new life seals the love. If the love still escapes for some reason, your separation with dignity and honesty requires you to put the new life at highest priority.
Don't you ever mix the comfort, luxury, wealth, seduction, sex with love as the love is pure and unconditional, it is there even if you lose your comfort, confidence, or security for it is the glue for all the ups and downs of life.
Happy Valentine's day to all, let the love in, allow it to grow. For some reason if the love is not there anymore, be brave to acknowledge it, do the separation with dignity and honesty.a new love can start unexpectedly, but never ever allow new one to grow before ending the old.

much better, enter HI, Humanity Intelligence, interconnecting billlions of brain cells per human in progressively more elaborate manners (instant broadcast, feedback, branching, adaptation). That is where I see the most value out of technologies that we humankind are advancing.
you are in the very process of interconnecting human brains for a common task. I find this exciting, and I am confident that many more will follow. Extension of wikipedia into real-time exchanges and updates of ideas, concepts, understandings. Step aside AI, we have something
we are entering real-time cooperation of many brains and one collaborative research team of many scientists, parallelization that is commonplace everywhere is coming to the process of scientific discovery. Please continue your efforts, with so many brains looking at the problems
By running of ideas with the community at large, humanity can advance in science in such a speed that no cooperation of machines and computing resources can be match. Independent one-brain era of discovery reading the works of others with long publishing life cycles is over,
Mike, I think you are spearheading scientific progress and discovery endeavor in a new way using the communications capabilities of our times and the conscienceness about the value of collective thought benefits of which are evident in open-source and crowd-sourced projects. https://t.co/V531m5xgXA

US assigned Mogadishu embassador only recently with $300M budget.	US can strike in Somalia or Libya	but not in Nigeria.	Russians sell Algeria high end military equipment there are many camps from conflicts and from femine ngos do not operate freely.
Gjibouti took the port from UAE a year ago, has no intentions of selling the port to China. Still US has the risk of being denied to access and if that happens most African missions will be impacted.
China hosted 50 of 52 African countries heads of states. 	US hosted only 40 defense officials.	China visited Africa with 80 senior level officials. US needs more relation building.  	Djibouti is the first military base of China overseas to protect their business interests.
Russia brought nuclear weapons and military gear while Cuba brought in military guards that protect Maduro government.	There are 2000 generals on staff	2 weeks of pressure on Venezuela degraded the military force with signs of cracking expected any time.
Venezuela is going through crisis for 2 weeks now Madura holding onto the power after Guaido claiming elections victory.	Maduro gets help of Russia Cuba and Iran and with the support of neighboring Caribbean countries who get cheap oil from Venezuela.	Maduro blocks the roads.

Kozyrkov tells us that (with cloud behind it) AI has gone from being the province and preserve of a few researchers in just a handful of locations, to becoming a global community of people from all walks of life.
Machine learning and AI are about learning from examples and the unfortunate reality of earlier decades is that there simply wasn‚Äôt much data to go around. Today, the world is collecting more data than ever before, so businesses now have the fuel to make AI tick.
TensorFlow‚Äôs ‚Äòtriumph‚Äô (as Google would put it) is in making code less power-hungry, helping us to avoid wasted compute cycles unnecessarily through inefficient calculations or hardware left idling while it‚Äôs not needed.
Originally hailing from the Google Brain division (but later open sourced for everyone), TensorFlow is a machine learning framework that increases the efficiency with which the neural network computations are carried out behind the scenes.
@quaesita @Forbes Excerpt: 	Even if you can rent a datacenter, training neural networks with naive brute force will probably still require more hardware than you‚Äôd reasonably want to be using. Kozyrkov contends that this is where TensorFlow comes in.
The sector is hot right now, with cybersecurity startups¬†raising $5.3 billionlast year globally, up from $4.4 billion in 2017, according to Strategic Cyber Ventures.
Illumio competes with a number of cybersecurity companies, including¬†Bromium¬†and¬†Tanium, both of which are funded by Andreessen Horowitz. 	Other rivals include Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers-backed¬†Shape Security and Ionic Security.
This also offers clients flexibility, so if they wish to change their server provider, for example, Illumio‚Äôs protection moves with them.	https://t.co/gtdsZFkJ6W
Illumio‚Äôs products operate on a¬†micro-segmentation model, adding a software security layer around every computing instance (servers and containers). They provide organizations the ‚Äúvisibility of an MRI machine,‚Äù the company says.
Specifically, the company will continue to expand its presence in the U.S., EMEA, and APAC regions, where Illumio claims to have seen a 50 percent increase in total global headcount in 2018.
CEO and cofounder¬†Andrew Rubin is now focused on taking Illumio to the next level. ‚ÄúWith this latest round of funding, we‚Äôre continuing to invest in scaling our global go-to-market, as well as the innovation of our platform,‚Äù he said.
With over $332.5 million in funding¬†secured¬†to date(from¬†J.P. Morgan Asset Management, BlackRock, and Andreessen Horowitz), Illumio is one of the top-funded cybersecurity startups globally.
@evankirstel Excerpt:	Illumio¬†today secured $65 million in series E funding as the California-based cybersecurity startup seeks to push further into global markets.¬†	The new round was led by clients advised by J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Illumio said, without disclosing names.

Thank you. God Bless You, God Bless America, and good night!
We must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America's destiny -- that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!
together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.		This is our future -- our fate -- and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness.		No matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.
We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.		This is the time to re-ignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us
We have not yet begun to dream.		We must choose whether we are defined by our differences -- or whether we dare to transcend them.		We must choose whether we will squander our inheritance -- or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible.
What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered?		I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come.
the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history.
Here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and
We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East.		As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars.
and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.		Our brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded.
One of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East.		Our approach is based on principled realism -- not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel --
we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement -- but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.
and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict.		In Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in these negotiations,
With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.
Now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.		I have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor --
we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country.		We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people.We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed.
When I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers.
My Administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.		To ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall,
Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.
Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence ‚Äì- not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free.
and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.
Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido.		We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom --
right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.
As part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would
- in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.
Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.		Perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't ‚Äì
Under my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests.		For example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter,
For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO -- but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies.		As part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System.
The final part of my agenda is to protect America's National Security.		Over the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military -- with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share.
Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children -- born and unborn -- are made in the holy image of God.
To defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb.
mother's womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.
There could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the
I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave -- so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.
Many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research.	To help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America's children.

The next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs -- and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.		Already, as a result of my Administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest

directed energy to lasers to some kind of cyber or other kind of threat that deals with a non kinetic threat or even a kinetic capability to defend. But you may also have to develop your own similar kind of weapon to have the capability in the theater the Russians then have.
Putin has clearly calculated, is worth having despite whatever costs we may come up with. So we pull out of the treaty. So what?  he's got a very effective threat in the European theater. So you got to develop defenses against it. They can be anything from you know
unlike a ballistic missile which has a fairly lots of minutes going up-and-coming back down, cruise missile is hard to detect. There is not very much time to pick it up, to track it, and it's not easy to have a weapon to intercept it. So this is an effective weapon that

an opponent's capability less capable, swarm is a challenge. But you know, even given the argument over stability versus instability, it's the right answer to go down vs a suicide pact that mutually assures destruction.
Gen. Carlisle: If you develop an exquisite missile defense capability, is that destabilizing or stabilizin? You know, I think it's something that you got to look at for what it is, and that is your ability to defend your people. It's not an offensive weapon. It renders

the national defense strategy commission picked up on it and agrees with that. That's one of the things we can use to deter a Russia, for example, and the other is to develop a kind of missile defense that would so complicate the planning that even if they send 200 missiles over
in other words, a kind of weapon we might want to use in that context to prevent us from escalating up to the wig weapon, and is an area, I think we need a lot more discussion about. It's been recommended as prt of the nuclear posture review,

from aegis ships, aegis to shore. But that does take a budget. and it does take money. and it takes the department of defense to make that a priority in taking that to congress.
Dr. Jon Kennedy: in terms of priority you need to make homeland defense, the homeland the priority and that's what the ground base interceptors about. This example of the standard missile block 2a does have a kill capability we can bring online quickly and be launched
Dr. Kennedy, but I think he's reached out to industry. I think industry knows the department's interest in it and the way to move forward and that's one of the key strategic technologies that we've got to move out of.
duplicitous work again there's not enough time or money in the budget to do multiple events to get to one end game of a hypersonic capability. I do believe, in having talked to Dr. Griffin recently, I do believe that he sees that and he's working hard and I think again, I'd ask

I agree with what Secretary Mattis said, we have the capability, we need to, in my opinion, strategically develop the technology and we need to put the effort forth and determine where we're going and make that happen, the capacity of what we're going to try to do
is, yeah, but we can - there is counter and a lot of capability out there to counter whatever you're doing. If you ask the saying goes, take out the archer before he shoots the arrow, we can do that too depending on who the adversary is and where we're going after that.

we just don;t have enough directed energy weapons today to enable that. 	Sen Jon Kyl: may I just make a point?	Ye, we can kill a missile, the question is can we deter an attack from an enemy like Russia or China and because they have such a large volume of missiles that they can

of space. We've already started that. You're seeing the price of launches has come down significantly because of the commercialization of the launch vehicle business. We're starting to see high-end sensors, the cost come down significantly, with advanced technology.
I think what has changed since the SDI days, technology has changed where I believe it's viable to be able to achieve that type of a system with the reasonable cost. You are going to ask what's reasonable. I'm going to say reasonable is going to be tied to the commercialization
Also looking at the boost phase part of the launch and working cyber effects and other techniques in that area and borrowing from some of the SDI rather than having it in space that can be launched down and at the same time doing it in a cost-effective way.
multiply that technology, I described some of the ways of multiplying it before relative to having space layer of sensors, that continue the track of these missiles launched, bringing in the directed energy capabilities that I mentioned, will also help in that area.
Morgan Brennan: Dr. Kennedy, Are Americans too optimistic right now?	Tom Kennedy: I am optimistic that we can take out a threat and we can kill a ballistic missile. 	Senator Jon Kyl: a missile.	Tom Kennedy: A balistic missile coming out, so technology exists, but we have to
that kind of number, but we haven't done it so far and it will take a lot of political will and money and more application of technology to get there.

A grand jury only needs to determine probable cause to indict someone on federal charges, while criminal jurors must acquit or convict based on proof "beyond a reasonable doubt."
The standard of proof for a grand jury to hand down a federal indictment, however, is lower than the standard jurors in criminal cases are instructed to apply when deciding whether to convict a defendant.
In other words, all of the indictments handed down in the Mueller probe have been based not just on evidence uncovered by prosecutors and investigators, but approved by at least 12 mystery jurors based on testimony they've heard and evidence they've reviewed.
Federal prosecutors in any case, not just long-term investigations like the Mueller probe, must secure the approval of at least 12 grand jurors before indicting any person or entity on federal charges.
Similar to how criminal defendants have a constitutional right to a jury of their peers to ensure the fairest possible outcome, grand juries exist to add another layer of accountability to the process of charging those implicated in federal criminal probes.
grand juries hear testimony and review evidence in criminal inquiries over a period of months to determine whether or not to indict one more people suspected of committing federal crimes.

An elliptic curve E over a number field has its zeta function L(E, s) (called the L-function of E). For E: y2 = x3 + 1 and E: y2 = x3 ‚àí 2 over Q, the order of zero of L(E, s) at s = 1 is 0 and 1, respectively,

Iwasawa showed that the p-adic zeta function was essentially an element of the Iwasawa algebra, and formulated the so-called Iwasawa main conjecture which has (roughly speaking) the form 		p-adic zeta function = ideal class group with Galois action.
The p-adic properties of values of the Riemann zeta function, which first appeared in Kummer‚Äôs congruence, were summarized by Kubota and Leopoldt [24] as the existence of the p-adic Riemann zeta function which interpolates the zeta values Œ∂(r) (r ‚àà Z, r ‚â§ 0) p-adically.

But the above criterion (1) of Kummer shows that the ideal class group is in fact a ‚Äúsweet group‚Äù which has a wonderful relation with zeta values.	I add that this study of Kummer was the start of the theory of ideals which became later important in

One of the great achievements of modern number theory is the proof by Breuil,	Conrad, Diamond and Taylor [9] of the Shimura‚ÄìTaniyama (or modularity) conjecture for elliptic curves over Q. This built on the earlier pioneering work of Wiles [83], and of Taylor and Wiles [81],

As recently as 2015, Nuno Freitas, Bao V. Le Hung, and Samir Siksek 	proved the analogous modularity statement over real quadratic	number fields. Few results have as rich a	mathematical history and as dramatic a	proof as Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem.
The new ideas introduced by Wiles were	crucial to many subsequent developments,	including the proof in 2001 of the general	case of the modularity conjecture by	Christophe Breuil, Brian Conrad, Fred	Diamond, and Richard Taylor.
Wiles showed that in the remaining cases the Galois	representation given by the points of order	five is modular. This completed his proof of	the modularity conjecture, and thus also of	Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem.

the points of finite order in the abelian group	structure on an elliptic curve. Building upon	Barry Mazur‚Äôs deformation theory for such	Galois representations, Wiles identified	a numerical criterion which ensures that	modularity for points of order p can be lifted	to modularity
It was therefore a	stunning advance when Andrew Wiles, in	a breakthrough paper published in 1995,	introduced his modularity lifting technique	and proved the semistable case of the	modularity conjecture. The modularity 	lifting technique of Wiles	concerns the Galois symmetries of
Kenneth Ribet in 1986. Hence, a proof of the Shimura-Taniyama-Weil modularity conjecture for semistable elliptic curves would also	yield a proof of Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem. 	However, at the time the modularity	conjecture was widely believed to be	completely inaccessible.
In 1984, Gerhard Frey associated a	semistable elliptic curve to any hypothetical	counterexample to Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem,	and strongly suspected that this elliptic	curve would not be modular. 	Frey‚Äôs nonmodularity was proven via Jean-Pierre	Serre‚Äôs epsilon conjecture by

However, the TSW conjecture says just the	opposite, that all elliptic curves are modular.	So when Ken Ribet a few years later	proved Frey‚Äôs assertion, the only obstacle	to proving FLT was to prove the TSW	conjecture. Many experts considered this	to be a challenge for the distant

The resulting complexity increase might become significant, especially for increasing sizes of the FFT.
In particular, it requires a higher computational complexity. As we can see from the NCP-SC scheme in Figure 1.10, both an FFT and IFFT operations are required at the receiver. OFDM, on the other hand, only requires one FFT at the receiver.

In light of these considerations, one possibility for mmWaves is to dispense with multicarrier transmissions, eliminating its drawbacks, and resorting instead to single-carrier (SC) modulation formats. In Ghosh et al. [35], the null cyclic prefix single carrier (NCP-SC) scheme
This makes digital beamforming unfeasible, since the energy required for	digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital conversion would be huge. Thus, each user will have an own radio-frequency beamforming, which requires users to be separated in time rather than in frequency.

In the original papers on FTN signaling [22, 23, 24], this optimal time spacing is obtained as the smallest value giving no reduction of the minimum Euclidean distance with respect to the Nyquist case. This ensures that, asymptotically,	the ISI-free bit-error rate (BER)

Then, they are passed through a pulse shape of length Ng, aimed at attenuating sidelobe levels in the frequency domain, and summed together (see Figure 1.8). In principle, we may use different filters for each branch.
Equipped with this notation, we can now illustrate the UFMC transmitter operation (see Figure 1.8). The B data vectors s1, . . . , sB are processed with the IDFT submatrices V1, . . . ,VB, respectively. https://t.co/tQbwKiYcEf

This additional filtering, together with the IFFT/FFT operation, forms a synthesis-analysis filter-bank structure, where the prototype filter is designed to significantly suppress ISI.
at the transmit and receive side, besides the IFFT/FFT blocks. This is done by filtering each output of the FFT by a frequency-shifted version of a lowpass filter p(t), termed a ‚Äúprototype‚Äù filter.
The approach used by FBMC to overcome this issue is to keep the symbol duration unaltered, thereby avoiding the introduction of any time overhead, and to cope with the overlap among adjacent multicarrier symbols in the time domain by adding an additional filtering
This enables the preservation of traditional transceiver implementations by IFTT and FFT operations, but introduces a time overhead in	the communication, resulting into a loss of spectral efficiency.
plain orthogonal multicarrier modulation formats are not able tomaintain orthogonality due to ISI among consecutivemulticarrier symbols. The traditional approach in OFDM to counter this issue is to introduce a CP longer	than the time spread introduced by the channel.
1.2 New Modulation Formats: FBMC, GFDM, BFDM, UFMC and TFP 	We now review some of the modulation schemes that are being considered for adoption in future 5G wireless networks.	1.2.1 Filter-bank Multicarrier (ed. FBMC)	As is well-known, in the presence of multi-path channels,
Due to the U-points FFT operation, the SC-FDMA strategy exhibits a PAPR smaller than that of pure OFDMA, since the transmitted signal is basically equivalent to an oversampled single-carrier signal.
the active users must transmit synchronously so that the base station receiver is able to simultaneously collect the data from the users that are using the K available subcarriers.
subcarriers that are not assigned to the th user, and the th user data at the remaining U positions. The K-dimensional block is passed through the IFFT block, then a CP is added and, after upconversion, signal transmission	happens. Note that, according to the OFDMA principle,
in the current resource slot, a block of U QAM symbols is FFTed and mapped onto the assigned subcarriers. At the output of the ‚Äúsubcarrier mapping‚Äù block, the ‚Äúzero padding‚Äù block forms a vector of K elements, containing	zero values at the positions corresponding to the K ‚àí U
a slightly different version of OFDM. 	LTE Uplink:	Figure 1.2 depicts the typical SC-FDMA transmission scheme implemented in	the generic th user mobile device. Letting U denote the number of subcarriers (out of the available K) that have been assigned to the th user https://t.co/LjN7qBngkM
expensive amplifiers at the transmitter (i.e. at the base station), this is not the case in the uplink, where the transmitter is a small mass-market mobile device. Accordingly, the modulation and multiple-access strategy used in the uplink of LTE is the so-called SC-FDMA strategy
Despite its simplicity and the aforementioned immunity to multipath distortion, OFDM has some key drawbacks and among these one of the most severe is the large PAPR, which requires amplifiers with an extended linearity range. While in the downlink we can usually afford to have
is included in the data block, which is then sent to a single-carrier modulator for transmission. After propagation through the channel, the CP is removed, and the block of K observables is passed through an FFT transformation.
A block of K QAM symbols (s(1), s(2), . . . , s(K)) is mapped onto the available K subcarriers and then IFFT is performed. After the IFFT, the CP, whose length must be larger than the channel impulse response duration,
LTE Downlink:	OFDM is an orthogonal block transmission scheme which, in ideal conditions, is not affected by intercarrier interference and intersymbol interference	(ISI). Figure 1.1 shows a block scheme for the OFDM modem. https://t.co/tIzubvnHne
1.1.1 The LTE Solution: OFDM and SC-FDMA	The current 4G standard, the LTE system, is based on the use of the OFDM modulation for the downlink and of the single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) technique for the uplink [4].

So do you think it could be possible to savior these accounts? 	@ahmetkirac (not this but the original one)	@twanchor - does not exist anymore.	What are the legalities say about this? @TheGDPR ??	Am I entitled to those accounts, or at least the contents in them?
Both have significant value for me in that, first holds all my personal stuff, the second holds many automated techniques for breaking news just like your traditional news anchor would do. It would tweet from around the globe, the breaking news of importance to the people.
@ahmetkirac had my original account from the first days of Twitter back in early 2007 and @twanchor as a later account while I was at EMC (now @DellEMC) for an experimental work on new anchoring (#news #anchor #journalism ) using twitter: it was short for Twitter Anchor.
I even wrote to @jack asking him to help me to at least recover my tweets and follow lists, but no answer. So when the tools are at internet scale and when ML is in charge of support how do you really get to connect with a real person to explain that your situation is unique?
The problem was that by the time I wanted to re-activate the accounts, it was beyond 1 month grace period for deleting them! I was upset. I wrote to @TwitterSupport but the machine in charge of that did not yet understood my particular problem.
I then tried to re-activate Twitter accounts, as I noticed that this machine learning practical tools are starting to make an impact on utilizing social media, both increasing the content (map) and reducing it to your interests (reduce) and utilizing it (analytics).
I stayed with LinkedIn to continue to nurture my appetite for networking and learning, and expand my horizons. It was hard to ignore the industry trends of data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence as they were appearing everywhere for everyone.
right around the early days of Twitter I opened two accounts, one had the same username as I have today, @ahmetkirac and the other was @twanchor . I have inactivated both last summer as privacy concerns were peaking then and Twitter was becoming noisier every passing day.
and finally, yes, the medium:	https://t.co/jBJxPqXJ8C

It‚Äôs a fascination Manning shares with Assange. With Dehaye. With the keepers of secrets and the leakers of secrets.  But for a moment, there‚Äôs a glimpse of another Manning. A private individual with a private life doing nerdy things with numbers.
most animated I‚Äôve seen her. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre magical, impossible to predict, you can‚Äôt build an algorithm to detect them, but they‚Äôre in nature. Nature understands prime numbers.‚Äù They‚Äôre also, she points out, important in cryptography. To secrets. They underpin encryption technology.
It was on the Riemann hypothesis ‚Äì an unsolved theorem about the distribution of prime numbers ‚Äì and though we‚Äôve just been discussing how exhausted she is after a 14-hour day, her eyes light up. ‚ÄúThat was such an important book to me! I‚Äôm obsessed with prime numbers.‚Äù It‚Äôs the
While waiting to go on stage to host a Q&amp;A session at the ICA, I tell her that a friend of mine, Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a Swiss mathematician who paved the way in investigating Cambridge Analytica, sent her a book in prison.
Chelsea Manning speaks at an anti-fracking rally in Baltimore last April. Photograph: Patrick Semansky/AP https://t.co/lM8LT58YO5
I‚Äôve started to think of algorithms as primitive living entities. When I work with neural networks I get this chilling feeling. They‚Äôre acting like inorganic life forms.‚Äù
At the same time, she offers a chilling vision of where we‚Äôre heading with artificial intelligence, of systems that are already beyond our control.	‚ÄúThere is something really deep going on inside machine-learning systems, especially neural network-type machine learning‚Ä¶
It slightly amazes me that there haven‚Äôt been more whistleblowers from inside the tech industry, I say. ‚ÄúThat will change,‚Äù Manning says. She believes the tech community, the developers, will recognise their power, their responsibility.
Just as trans issues now have ‚Äúmore visibility. But visibility is not the same as equality.‚Äù We know what‚Äôs going on, she says, in politics, in technology. We‚Äôre just not doing enough about it.
Manning doesn‚Äôt like the word ‚Äúwhistleblower‚Äù. It makes political change seem like an exclusive club, she says. She wants everyone ‚Äúto realise they have political agency‚Äù. The problem the world has now, she says, ‚Äúis not an information problem, it‚Äôs an action problem‚Äù.
just how alone she was. It took a year for me to get Christopher Wylie on the record to talk about Cambridge Analytica, I tell her, partly because it was a matter of finding the right support for him, whereas she undertook this incredibly bold and brave move entirely alone.
But when I was presenting as male, I was still very feminine so there was always that issue that I was never good enough. I was never male enough to be widely accepted. And now that I‚Äôm presenting as female the same issues are there.‚Äù	It‚Äôs striking, I say, reading the Lamo logs,
which turned out to include a pair of Reuters journalists. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she told Lamo. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just weird I guess. I can‚Äôt separate myself, others. I feel connected to everybody‚Ä¶ like they were distant family. I‚Ä¶ care?‚Äù	‚ÄúI‚Äôm trans. I was trans before and I‚Äôm trans now.
In their chat, she refers to watching the video that she leaked to WikiLeaks, which WikiLeaks in turn released to the world under the title ‚ÄúCollateral Murder‚Äù, that shows a bird‚Äôs-eye view of US soldiers shooting a group of Iraqis,
https://t.co/NJ2hkerIPL
the material was reclassified after the trial ‚Äì but they‚Äôre a compelling read, especially with the knowledge that, unknown to her, Lamo was working with the FBI and would later turn her in.
There‚Äôs a record of her mental state at the time in the logs of chats that she had with a hacker, Adrian Lamo, whom she met on an online forum. They were later published in Wired magazine, though she can‚Äôt confirm these conversations or talk about them for legal reasons ‚Äì
I saw these local activists in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, pull down a Confederate statue and it was the most fucking inspiring moment in my life to say the least.‚Äù They didn‚Äôt wait for permission, she says. And ‚Äúby going outside the bounds, they changed the conversation‚Äù.
She campaigned in a Senate race last year but she also favours Malcolm X-style direct action, up to and including breaking the law.	‚ÄúI am there to stand in support of folks whenever they go out there and protest.
She calls it the ‚Äúwhirling death machine‚Äù, a ‚Äúnationalist authoritarian regime‚Äù that has only speeded up under Trump. And she believes the solution won‚Äôt necessarily come through the ballot box.
America‚Äôs problems are way bigger than Trump, she says. ‚ÄúAll these systems, our court system, our military, our prison system, the intelligence apparatus, have all been going through this buildup, buildup, buildup over several decades.‚Äù
She changed her name to Chelsea and decided to live outwardly as a woman the day after she was sentenced to 35 years in another hyper-macho environment ‚Äì a male prison. Another rupture.
Later, she plunged herself into one of the most hyper-macho environments imaginable ‚Äì an army unit in a war zone ‚Äì just as her discomfort at her outward appearance as a man was becoming unbearable.
Manning has lived more lives than most and she‚Äôs still only 30. Her aunt painted a brutal picture of childhood isolation and neglect at her trial ‚Äì her parents had problems with alcohol, her mother with a history of psychiatric problems.
16 May 2017	Manning is freed from Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. ‚ÄúWhatever is ahead of me, is far more important than the past,‚Äù she says in her first comment as a free woman.
The next day she announces through her lawyer that she is transgender and wishes to be known as Chelsea Manning.	17 January 2017	Barack Obama commutes Manning‚Äôs sentence and sets the date of her release.
29 July 2013	Manning is cleared of ‚Äúaiding the enemy‚Äù, the most serious charge, but is found guilty of a total of 20 counts, including several under the Espionage Act.	20 August 2013	Manning is sentenced to 35 years.
28 February 2013	Manning pleads guilty to leaking military information, but not guilty to 12 of the most serious charges, including ‚Äúaiding the enemy‚Äù.	2 June 2013	Manning‚Äôs court martial begins at Fort Meade, Maryland.
23 April 2011	The Guant√°namo files are released by the Guardian and the New York Times, containing the US‚Äôs secret assessments of detainees at the US base in Cuba.-	6 December 2011	Manning‚Äôs first pre-trial hearing begins.
28 November 2010	250,000 US embassy cables are published by the Guardian and other international outlets, revealing what diplomats really think about their postings and exposing widespread corruption in regimes across the Middle East.
The UN later denounces her conditions as a form of torture.	21 October 2010	The Iraq war logs are published, detailing civilian deaths, torture, summary executions and war crimes in what Manning summed up as the ‚Äútrue nature of 21st-century asymmetric warfare‚Äù.
24 July 2010	A series of reports on the Afghanistan war, based on US military internal logs, are published by the Guardian, the New York Times and other media groups.	28 July 2010	Manning is moved to Quantico in the US, where she is held in a solitary cell for 23 hours a day.

Free VPN App Investigation: Chinese Ownership, Secretive Companies &amp; Weak Privacy https://t.co/qyToZfG9ln
These findings also raise important questions as to why China allows these companies to operate in defiance of its strict laws prohibiting the use of VPN software, and with whom this data is shared once it is received.
Despite their opacity, these companies were able to gain credibility in the eyes of unwitting consumers by virtue of being approved by Apple and Google for listing in their app stores.

Westwood shocks the audience, a well-heeled, gender-fluid art crowd, by referring a number of times ‚Äì sincerely, but forgetfully ‚Äì to Chelsea by her previous name. ‚ÄúHe was my hero,‚Äù she says as hostility ripples through the audience and people shout: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Chelsea!‚Äù
It‚Äôs another jump cut for Manning. From a cage in the Kuwaiti desert, where she was exfiltrated after being caught while serving in Iraq, to the ICA‚Äôs Nash-designed villa a few hundred yards from Buckingham Palace.
It seems unlikely that Manning‚Äôs trip to London last week will have made any of this any clearer. Stefan Kalm√°r, the ICA‚Äôs newish, politically minded director, had invited her to London to give a talk and be the guest of honour at a fundraising dinner hosted by Vivienne Westwood.
How she was caught, court martialled and sentenced to 35 years in prison. And how, in one of Barack Obama‚Äôs last acts as president, she was suddenly and unexpectedly granted clemency last year and freed.
How in 2010, then aged 22 and presenting as male, she downloaded and leaked, via Julian Assange‚Äôs WikiLeaks, 750,000 classified and sensitive documents that revealed America‚Äôs secret diplomatic cables and Iraqi and Afghanistan war logs. https://t.co/IxyvJOzsEp
Whenever people are advocating for or alluding to ethnic cleansing, any time you‚Äôre discussing the possibility of an entire group being suppressed, or removed from society, that is violence.‚Äù
Isn‚Äôt this like advocating for armed revolution? I ask. For civil unrest?		‚ÄúWell, I mean violent acts are happening to us all the time. It‚Äôs a question of self-defence‚Ä¶
‚ÄúLaw and order is already broken down. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs unrest. Whenever you have authoritarian power, centralised power that ends up affecting millions of people, you‚Äôve already had a system breakdown.‚Äù
