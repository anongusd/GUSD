Limbaugh just spent almost 15 mins blowing smoke up Trump's ass in MO at the so-called midterm rally. Sounded more like a Trump re-election rally.  Whether it's deemed either doesn't change the fact that it's costing the citizens over $200,000.00 per hr just to fly Trump to these https://t.co/6b0skjxtTq
