@LeahRigueur I will have to get a copy of it. Is it at Barnes and Noble or do you have to order it online?
@LeahRigueur I agree &amp; I guess it has bothered my the free ride Goldwater got. By stabbing Nixon in the back during Watergate, he became a hero to liberals. And that has obscured his very horrible role in Civil Rights in the 60's. Creating the atmosphere Nixon had to navigate &amp; got blamed 4
@LeahRigueur As for Senator Thurmond, I struggle with understanding his ancient past with the man I knew. He was kind, thoughtful &amp; helpful to his constituents on level personally that I have never seen in a Senator before or since. Its a dichotomy hard to figure out.
@LeahRigueur In a lot of ways Nixon was almost 2 different people (or more) he was willing to do what it took to win but once in office  his record is very good. Especially on civil rights like desegregating the school systems, affirmative action and money for fostering black entrepreneurship
@LeahRigueur He only made a miscalculation when he did not call King the way Kennedy did, which was totally politically motivated,  but Nixon worked the back channels to get King out of jail and got no credit for it.
@LeahRigueur Nixon's actual record is consistently strong on civil rights, even with the tapes and some of the political maneuvering for 1968. Nixon was pro civil rights in the 1950;s when others were not and as President his record is also strong and he was always friendly with Dr. King
@LeahRigueur Full disclosure i helped Senator Thurmond in his dinal campaign when he was 94. But my read is that Goldwater not Nixon is responsible for the Southern strategy and Nixon has been unfairly smeared for it while Goldwater got a pass

@TimNaftali @republicofspin @NotoNixon @tombrokaw @Morning_Joe Why did you refuse to allow the Nixon written exhibit to stand along side the new one? That would have been easy to do and since he helped write it, it had historic significance. I don't see why those of you hard on Nixon call those pro Nixon unobjective when you aren't either
@NotoNixon He was the President getting it done. No President after even tried until Obama. So why the animus and why the effort to keep him from getting his due.
@NotoNixon True, What i honestly don't understand is people who are liberals focus on not giving Nixon credit. As I see it healthcare, a living wage, civil rights, womens right,environmental protection &amp; workplace protections all would be a reality or done 45 years ago if Nixon had survived
@NotoNixon Perhaps its being rehabilitated because he was one of the 5 greatest Presidents in history. Plus for all his arguably bigoted statements on tape, when push came to shove, he was actually a civil rights icon be it Israel, Black or Native Americans.

@icebergdad Dean had a number of inconsistencies in his testimony and the first jury that did acquit people said they did not believe him. Hence Sirica bringing him in and throwing the book at him. Again I suggest you look at Geoff Sheppard's book. It lays it out and documents what happened.
@icebergdad And one more comparing me to a Nazi and this conversation will end
@icebergdad Last I checked Starr was on that list, and if you bothered to read my posts, you will see I found the Clinton Impeachment more unjust than Nixon's case, because Nixon had at least done something that justified investigating.
@icebergdad It is hard to defend yourself if a Judge is "colluding" with the prosecution, and lets not BS each other the target was always Nixon. Sirica was guiding the Prosecutor through, who was in turn working with the congressional investigation.  It is sickening.
@icebergdad Then after losing the NYC case against Mitchell &amp; learning Dean's credibikity was a jury issue, they dragged Dean into court gave him the max sentence, but protected him while he was testifying. After convicting The others brought him back in &amp; said time served. That was criminal

@icebergdad I also own a copy of the Nixon/Frost interviews and that quote is taken way out of context.
@icebergdad Do you read what I write or just skim? I never said he resigned for health reasons, he most likely accepted the pardon for them though. He resigned because his base was gone based on the smoking gun tape. The one charge that have repeatedly said had merit.
@icebergdad The work place, brought peace to the world that lasted for more than a generation. Seems to me he should be a hero to yall. Instead they overthrew him and handed tge Presidency to conservative leadership much more strident for the next 28 years from 1980 to 2008

@icebergdad Plus it was already known that the bills were oked to be paid prior to the smoking gun tapes release. If that had been a crime of and to itself that would have forced his resignation prior to August 74
@icebergdad Nixon never said that. The bills were just paid. As Dean says no one told Nixon until the blackmail attempt by Hunt in March 73. One source "The Nixon Tapes" Nichtor/Brinkley goes through this and Brinkley says point plank "no one was honest with Nixon until March" that is clear
@icebergdad As Dean himself says repeatedly, no one sat down and planned obstruction of justice. He, Halderman, Erlichman, Mitchell and Magruder sort of fell into it and outside of the one briefing with Halderman over the democratic break in thing, Nixon was not told much until March 73
@icebergdad Hunt attempted to blackmail the WH in March. That is the entire cancer on the Presidency speel. Up to that point the burglars had been paid with no issue from anyone. So Nixon did not even know about it up to that point.
@icebergdad That is the one charge that sticks, as Ive said repeatedly, but a taoe does exist later of Nixon talking to the FBI Director Gray telling him to follow the evidence wherever it leads including the White House itself. Exculpatory in and of itself. Dean only came to Nixon when
@icebergdad That was pretty well established the first day that Hunt was an employee of the campaign. As was Liddy. And I have avalanche of sources which I will be sending when I get home
@icebergdad And again I never said NO CRIMES, i said only one charge and in my opinion its debatable which is the smoking gun tape.
@icebergdad Why don't you start? There is literally not a book that says paying the defendents legal bills was illegal. They were employees of the campaign. Not even John Dean claims it was illegal. There is actually more debate over his advice about avoiding perjury, which was still legal

@icebergdad Rather than get caught in an area you are unclear of just say you don't recall or best to your recollection, like it or not that advice is legal. No evidence exists that he ordered either break in &amp; the 1 break in he does talk about never happened. Those are the facts.
@icebergdad You seem to be a believer in the myths of Watergate: Nixon did not commit tax evasion, did not abuse IRS, did not spend lavishly on his homes, did not give "hush money" he paid legal bills &amp; expenses which was legal, gave legal advice that any 1st year lawyer would give to say 1
@icebergdad I did not say no crimes occured. I said no evidence exists that Nixon himself was involved in anything other than 1 count of obstruction with the CiA/FBI. That a later tape does exist that could be argued nullified that tape. U have to divide off staff from him.

@icebergdad Sorry the historian not the reporter
@icebergdad So you have a two fold scandal of real crimes committed by staff and accusations of crime that were just BS designed to hurt Nixon politically. In the end, only one charge can actually be tied to Nixon himself and there is at least some defense to say he was not guilty of it.
@icebergdad Yes, by his aids but little to nothing actually ties him to them. Historian David Brinkley, not exactly Mr. Republican, in the introduction to the Nixon Tapes covering 1973 says it is very clear than no one dealt honestly with Nixon until March of 1973.
@icebergdad No but they exposed massive abuse of power by intelligence agencies and the previous two administrations. All unknown to the public during Watergate. Nixon could have exposed it all if he had been tried, and then some if the truth was known
@icebergdad Sorry for typos my phone keys are weirding out
@icebergdad That could have gotten both Sirica &amp; Cox disbarred. I would sugged you read Geoff Sheppards thoroughly researched "The Real Scandal of Watergate" that even Nixon Biographer J.A.Farrell recognizes as accurate.
@icebergdad In the end only one charge against Nixon olds water, the obstruction of justice on the famous tape. But Nixon is heard on a later phone call telling the FBI to go whereever the case leads. Also now we know Sirica was secretly meeting with the Special Prosecutor directing traffic
@icebergdad There is a thing call the bill of particulars that were at the end of the document. They are the specific crimes. Literally, everything unrelated to the actual break in at the WG and Fieldings office led to acquittals. Except for a minor finance violation in one case.
@icebergdad Sorry for typos
@icebergdad To avoid a trial of the Former President of the United States. Can you imagine, it would have made the Church hearings look like a walk in the park. The feds had as much to lose as Richard Nixon. For everything there 2 reasons the one that sounds good &amp; the real reason
@icebergdad No its not. If a man charged andnever trued is offeredone he can take it to avoid a trial. Nixon's pardon is different in tgat he was never charged or tried unlike most almost all other pardons in history
@icebergdad When you do that you will find 29 specific accusationd. 13 to do with a milk fund scandal, every single person tried was acquitted, another involved Ray Croc, founder of McDonalds, he begged them to indict him. The case was so wesk they wouldn't. Watergate was far from a slamdunk
@icebergdad Was Nixon delusional? Well again I point to Benton Becker, Ford's attorney who negotiated the pardon. When asked his opinion, he felt if a trial was held, &amp; a true unbias jury found, Nixon wins. Go look at the articles of impeachment and list of specific crimes
@icebergdad You do know he almost died in September of 1974. Phlebitis I believe. As for the pardon that is an opinion not law. An innocent man can take a pardon if its offered. While Haig tried to get one for Nixon he rebuffed. Nixon was approached by Ford's attorney not vice versa
@icebergdad In the end Nixon knew that if it was an airing out of dirty laundry Congress wanted he could give it to them. Ford knew it too.
@icebergdad Find me any statement where Nixon said he was guilty of a crime. He was begged to take the pardon. Go read Benton Beckers version of what happened. Nixon, sick &amp; depressed, still out maneuvered them all because he knew in reality the case was weak &amp; they folded like a cheap tent
@icebergdad The pardon was written intentionally so that it was not an admission of any guilt. It says " a pardon for any crimes he committed OR MAY have commited" it was designed for a very physically sick Nixon not to have to fight the case which he probably would have won

@crackthemessage John Jenrette was the congressman. I like him a lot. It was her dramatic difference in opinions that strikingly different. I don't think anyone regretted Watergate more than Nixon just as I know Jenrette regretted AbScam.
@northeast_mama @crackthemessage @MelissaJPeltier @Jodi______ @DrDinD @NYCanegirl No I am not a Roger Stone fan. The other Congressman involved is a friend of mine, who I actually like a lot. It was just the bashing of Nixon juxtaposed to the lavish praise of the fmr Congressman that was striking.
@DrDinD Out of respect for the former congressman, who I know &amp; like, I will not mention his name but it is a famous case. Its not that I dislike that congressman its that it was a dramatic case of the Republican was evil, the democrat was not.
@northeast_mama @crackthemessage @MelissaJPeltier @Jodi______ @DrDinD @NYCanegirl No its just two faced as hell to act like it was so tough, &amp; paint Nixon as mafia like &amp; then find out you were friends with an ex democrat that you praise lavishly who took $35,000 in bribes.

@icebergdad In South Carolina the first Republican Governor was elected in 1976. Strom Thurmond, who I campaigned for in 1996, switched party's for Goldwater not Nixon.
@icebergdad Nixon's record is actually among the 5 best ever on civil rights, no matter his private remarks. His 68 campaign was about law &amp; order during a time of sky high crime rates, drug use &amp; riots. That had nothing to do with race though I understand the foundation Goldwater had laid
@icebergdad It was a prolonged strategy by Goldwater to position himself against Kennedy in 1964. He courted all of those old dixiecrats including my Senator to come over. Goldwater also fought all the civil rights bill LBJ brought up after taking over. Nixon did none of that

@icebergdad Nixon's record on civil rights was among the 5 best ever as President and was strong in the 1950's and not just with Black Americans but it may actually be the best ever with Native Americans. So that is not an accurate description of his record.

@icebergdad Not to mention the discounting of later tapes wher Nixon &amp; Kissinger talk about how crazy Chennault was. That is written off as "they feared her". They can't prove that, it actually could be a cases of it is what it is. Just laughable nonsense.
@icebergdad Well it speaks poorly for him. Again, listen to Califano's statement about LBJ &amp; Nixon's relationship then go read "The Vantage Point" any 8th grader with a Library card could catch that lie. That was a poorly researched documentary that allowed way to much conjecture.

@icebergdad I am amazed that special survived any historical fact checker to make it on the air but since it was really aimed at Trump I am not surprised they did not bother to get their facts straight when hatchet jobbing Nixon. (and I am not a Trumpster)
@icebergdad Finally Califano told a bold faced lie on the show about LBJ's supposed hatred of Nixon. Tell me did he even bother to read "The Vantage Point", LBJ has an entire section on how he never shared his fellow democrats hatred of Nixon &amp; actually liked him. Any kid could find that (3)
@icebergdad Or his press secretary interviews. The Maddow soecial also just implies what was discussed in the meeting with Chennault and the ambassador but no notes or tapes exist of the meeting. So who knows what they talked about. 2
@icebergdad I have the "Maddow" tv special. An 8th grade social studies student could rip that joke apart. First off the tapes are all xclassic LBJ playing games with Dirksen &amp; staff. His own staff was by that period concerned about his mental stability , go see Richard Goodwin 1

@icebergdad Plenty of research on Lincoln but the press of 1860 is no match for the 1970's. As for Vietnam, Nixon inherited a disasterous mess from the previous administratation and the so called talks in Paris were still arguing about round or square tables when Nixon took over.
@icebergdad Great I have one too. Chennault is a laughable accusation based on LBJ's delusional paranoia ( his own staff admits too) &amp; trying to win one for Humphrey. If the press of the 1970's had been there &amp; hated Lincoln like they did Nixon then he would have been impeached too.

@hankmbsc @JimHeathTV I have studied energy issues for years on that NLC committee and have never seen credible evidence of the harm of seizmic testing. I supported the Obama administration's plan of all the above energy production &amp; the opportunities that it will produce.
@hankmbsc @JimHeathTV Years ago I supported Offshore Drilling. What has changed is we are finally opening up ANWR which could be the largest super field ever opened. That will guarantee our energy independence for 75 years, which should be priority 1. Then we can move forward with alt energy solutions

@MikeKoncewicz Still the constant comparison are unfair. Nixon inherited an absolute disaster created by the total incompetence of people who got us in &amp; then turned against the war and fought his every move to bring it to an honorable end. Obama left no such mess to clean up.
@MikeKoncewicz You have got to be joking? Nixon was winning a war &amp; dealing with the most divided nation since the Civil War. He as Abraham Lincoln did, who threw out Habeas corpus &amp; jailed congressman to save the union. Nixon was a great man as Lincoln was, there is no comparison to Trump

@RealBuzMartin I can't speak to Trump but the show last night did a lot of speculating as to who did what with little to no proof. Again, LBJ's own staff said 2 things. 1. No real peace was even close 2. LBJ's mental state was in question and he was given to paranoid conspiracy theories.
Ret. Admrial‚Äã William McRaven is everything President Trump is not https://t.co/9WW5eErPgD via @resurgent

@RealBuzMartin Finally as early as January 68. LBJ's own staff were concerned about his mental health because he was prone to depressions, angry, paranoid rages &amp; pronouncements. So these tapes sure seem consistent with those assessments. This was nothing but a hit job on Nixon to get at Trump
@RealBuzMartin Plus Nixon reportedly pawned Chennault of on Mitchell to deal with because he didn't want to waste much time with it.
@RealBuzMartin Like LBK's own negotiators saying over &amp; over no real agreement was possible. Plus what circumstantial evidence they had on Chennault they got illegally wiretapping her &amp; South Vietnamese embassy.
@RealBuzMartin What proof did Johnson ever have that Nixon did anything? None. These notes only show that Nixon felt the entire thing was a political ploy to swing the election. And plenty of evidence supports that theory.
@RealBuzMartin They need to prove it. They made Chennault look like she told this story because she was double crossed? What proif of that exists. The tapes show Nixon had little use for her capabilities so whst sense does it make he would trust her with a criminal act? That's insane.
@MSNBC @maddow That was a disgraceful misrepresentation of history. Richard Nixon was one of our greatest Presidents and this was a baseless attack. No wonder this neywork is considered a widespread joke.
MSNBC and Rachel Maddow should be proud that was an exemplary hit job on one of our greatest leaders, Richard Nixon, to bad there is so little truth in any of it. No wonder no one believes anything they say today. SMH @RichardNixon103 @nixonfoundation. @MSNBC #ChennaultAffair

@ijbailey @JimHeathTV @CNN That reminds me of working in 1996 when Bob Dole proposed raising school lunches by 2 billion and Clinton proposed 4 billion &amp; the dems ran around screaming the heartless Dole was starving poor children by cutting lunches by 2 billion. That dog just doesn't hunt anymore
@ijbailey @JimHeathTV @CNN I did not like the final comment at the time and said so. Of which you never acknowledged then or now. The military at the border is a decision he made to deal with the caravan. Calling it "a stunt" is a democratic talking point, that does not make it true.
I'm enjoying watching President Trump and President Obama go at it. That would have been an exciting election battle. Sort of like a Reagan vs Clinton or the actual Kennedy vs Nixon. I love these final campaign rallies.
@ijbailey @JimHeathTV @CNN You say that because I called Warren on the carpet. She was not standing up to "Trump's bigotry", she was bashing Jeff Sessions &amp; later Brett Kavanaugh. Sorry, I have no problem defending them. It was shameful in both cases.
@ijbailey @JimHeathTV @CNN Your example of bigotry was his opposition to illegal immigration. That is easy for you to say because no illegal is going to take your job. But I have talked to many contractors, for example, who struggle to compete. That is real, that is legitimate &amp; not bigotry.
@ijbailey @JimHeathTV @CNN You have an obvious agenda. Its clearly anti the President. Its obvious to everybody but you. The left always seems to resort to this stuff. In fact, the sad part is, I am rather well known for not having been a Trump supporter. I was turned off by the all or nothing mindset.

@ijbailey @JimHeathTV @CNN She is shameful. In 39 years I have never seen any Senator savage another Senator the way she did Jeff Sessions when he was appointed. She had absolutely no grounds for her Twitter attack. It was utterly shameful. Ironically he has behaved above reproach.
@ijbailey @JimHeathTV @CNN And I thought Trump's comments last night on Gillium were uncalled for, as were the ones on Gov of Georgia, though to me, not being an expert on race, the Gillium comments smacked more of being out of bounds.
@ijbailey @JimHeathTV @CNN Who did I attack on those grounds? Elizabeth Warren arguably the most divisive politician in America? She is in the top 3. And I believe u did say Comey deserved firing, just not by Trump, but that is from memory. And those "policy" breaks are pretty big especially on Special Pro

@ijbailey @JimHeathTV @CNN We agree and I called foul quite a bit when I was supporting Graham, then Kasich and Bush.
@ijbailey @JimHeathTV @CNN Really? Most of the time I get called the most personal of insults right off the bat by the people you defend. So sorry if I fight back.		In today's mobile society voter ID makes sense so that voter fraud never becomes an issue again.
@JimHeathTV @ijbailey @CNN Zucker is what is wrong and it started before Trump was elected. CNN, which out of habit I still watch, is just another MSNBC and its sickening. There is literally no single reliable news source left except the 30 minutes ABC News is on at 6:30.

@ijbailey @JimHeathTV @CNN And I originally was talking about an unfair attack by a tv network i used to love. I am sick of bias cheerleading news coverage be it FOX, MSNBC or CNN. You claim i can't read but you ignore 3 times I said I opposed gerrymandering, &amp; voter purging. But do support basic voter ID
@JimHeathTV @ijbailey @CNN Something is wrong with that network and has been since they ran off Larry King &amp; Candy Crowley. They have a clear anti Rep agenda on top of hatred for the President. That was my original post and I think anyone watching the network sees it including Ted Koppell &amp; Jeff Greenfield
@ijbailey @JimHeathTV @CNN I don't see how a simple ID is voter suppression. I do think pulling people off roles or going after Indian reservation PO Boxes is and I don't support it and have not. So this argument I don't care is not true but CNN did not do that last night. It was an attack piece.
@ijbailey @JimHeathTV @CNN You just want an extreme position on Trump and sorry I don't have one. What you are doing is pushing conservative people who do struggle with him at times into his corner with your over tge top 24/7 attacks some of which is outlandish
@ijbailey @JimHeathTV @CNN That is not true. If you bother to read. I support tge efforts of Obama to change Gerrymandering. I also don't support the efforts in North Dakota nor Georgia. I do support basic Voter ID laws because Ive never heard a decent argument against it.
@JimHeathTV @ijbailey @CNN Used it a lot. In this congressional district in particular a long with blatant voter intimidation including sending deputies into Republican party meeting parking lots writing down licence numbers. I was there! And it angers me the double standard right or wrong.
@JimHeathTV @ijbailey @CNN I don't make that argument and believe it is singularly the answer to moderating the divide with Congress along with returning to a 5 day work week. But CNN all but accused Republicans last night of overt racism and darn near inventing it. I go back 39 years in SC the other side
You say I lied @ijbailey. What part of this did I miss interpret? https://t.co/Lhieoxg3hu
@ijbailey @CNN Yes you are also a person whi ignores the rest the debate. Like I support ending gerrymandering but get of reporters like you ignoring the 60 years it was used against Republicans nor the decades of sending police to parking lots where republicans met getting licence numbers.
@ijbailey @CNN On one of these threads you said democrats never gerrymanded. You don't know the history of your own congressional district. Myrtle Beach was intentionally gerrymanded out of the 6th district into the first to prevent the old 6th from becoming republican.
@ijbailey @CNN That is the other thread. This one was you bashing trump
@ijbailey @CNN You only recognize things that hurt Trump. That is all you want to see and hear.
@ijbailey @CNN CNN
@ijbailey @CNN They also were excellent at voter intimidation. Like walking around getting licence plate numbers off cars parked at republican party meetings. My only point is CBN never said a word about the history of it while bashing republicans. Shameful!
@ijbailey @CNN I can't help that minorities vote overwhelmingly democratic. They need to come over because they are in fact pretty conservative. But the democrats did to gerrymander districts. I have good memory and started out in this state when it was run by democrats. They were experts at it
@ijbailey @CNN So don't do an entire special on the evils of it now because Republicans are using it to maintain control. Its like special prosecutor statutes as long as they were trying to lock up Nixon, Reagan, Bush and now Trump its great but they stopped it when it happened to Clinton
@ijbailey @CNN How are we doing that? Voter ID, I can't cash a simple check without ID. I don't like gerrymandering &amp; support measures to stop how its done BUT  I have been in politics since I was 9. The democrats used it to control Congress every year from 1932 to 1994 except 2 in the 1950s

@ijbailey @RealBuzMartin @jimwiles1 So when you going to hold the media accountable? For doctering a speech to make Trump appear racist by showing only the portion about Confederate General Lee while cutting out the part about Grant. What else have they doctored that has not been caught? That was NBC by the way.
@Gil_Brandt I never forgave Jones for how he fired Landry. I was a Cowboy fan until that day but between his HOF speech &amp; now this I could see me mellowing.

That disturbs me because you could see it escalating towards what happened &amp; no one was willing to back away on either side. Sad
@ijbailey @RealBuzMartin @jimwiles1 You are looking for an extreme position. I don't have one where Trump is concerned. I agree where I agree and disagree where I disagree. I don't like his hyperbole but I do like his policy in a lot of areas.
@ijbailey @RealBuzMartin @jimwiles1 Bigotry is a big charge and one not proven
@ijbailey @RealBuzMartin @jimwiles1 The caravan, immigration is not an issue I agree with Trump on at the extreme position he holds, but you can't just open the borders. I believe in legal immigration reform but dealing with this group has to done you can't just let them all in
@ijbailey @RealBuzMartin @jimwiles1 ME, that is a laugh. You are the king of mix and match. It appears to me you only want an extreme position. I don't have one on Trump. He is not my favorite but not my least either &amp; he deserves credit for his successes &amp; promises kept,  just like Obama did.
@ijbailey @RealBuzMartin @jimwiles1 NBC news just a few weeks ago accused Trump of being a racist &amp; even showed a video of Trump praising General Lee, only to get caught editing out the rest of his speech as he was building up to praise Gen Grant &amp; Lincoln. The press has an agenda!
@ijbailey @RealBuzMartin @jimwiles1 Tell me what he has done that is actually what the press claims he has done? When you fact check them it is often not what they claim. He is given to hyperbole which is frustrating but often the press attacks him for no reason, like Mika Brezinski last week. Fairness is all i ask
@ijbailey @RealBuzMartin @jimwiles1 I am at work
@ijbailey @RealBuzMartin @jimwiles1 I have heard him say politically insensitive things, Make statements where he has spoken in the vernacular of the common man but intentionally bigoted? The man has Jewish grandchildren hard for me to buy he is antisemitic.

@ijbailey @RealBuzMartin @jimwiles1 If you look at my speeches and platform it is almost like Trump watched the video and followed thru.

@ijbailey @RealBuzMartin @jimwiles1 Why would I have any reason to praise Obama? I did not bash him unfairly, when I did talk about him it was usually either about healthcare, regulations, and foriegn policy (the latter I actually praised some decisions more than just about any Republican)
@ijbailey @RealBuzMartin @jimwiles1 Could it be you are just looking for a reason to credit Obama for Trump's strong economy. I am perfectly willing to say Trump did not inherit the same situation Obama did but Trump's deregulation has created a surging economy not one with a slow expansion, it was still good.
@ijbailey @RealBuzMartin @jimwiles1 I have no idea if i ever specifically spoke to Obama's economy performance but I certainly am willing to give him credit for his role in turning around the tough situation he inherited, though I don't feel Bush was responsible for the meltdown that occured.
@ijbailey @RealBuzMartin @jimwiles1 There is no history of me being overly harsh to Obama.
@RealBuzMartin @jimwiles1 He is a President with considerable accomplishments. He behaves like a child at times which i struggle with but the bashers bash his every move, without mercy &amp; give him credit for nothing &amp; blame for everything no matter how outlandish
@ijbailey @RealBuzMartin @jimwiles1 I actually was rather complimentary of President Obama. I disagreed philosophically on a lot of his policy intiatives but always felt he dealt well with crisis, was one of our most emotionally healthy presidents &amp; seemed like a nice guy &amp; family man. Said it often in fact.
@ijbailey @RealBuzMartin @jimwiles1 He opened Anwar to drilling ( I worked on that for 10yrs), rolled back countless regulations &amp; unleashed the economy, cut taxes, put 2 conservatives on the Supreme Court, &amp; is now looking at serious entitlement reform which was a plank I ran for congress on.  That is strong
@ijbailey @RealBuzMartin @jimwiles1 I am truly objective. Unlike those of you who bash the man for waking up in the morning.
