I simply do not believe that Elizabeth Warren is not of Native American ancestry.#DennisMillerOption
Within roughly the next five years, I believe Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will either be "The Bachelorette" or the President of the United States. #DennisMillerOption
The last meritocracy! So it is written… So let it be done!
Wide LEFT! Brady wins!
And another Super Bowl victory for Brady who is antithetical to all the absolute bullshit that is happening in this culture right now!
... and Ann B. Davis as Alice!
Do you know why he's the G.O.A.T.? Because he's never the goat!
Goff short armed that like a kangaroo who has had Tommy John surgery!
Edelman is such a man he just told them when they give him the MVP car he doesn't want any fucking hybrid!
At 3-3 I would think they're vying for the Ernie Lombardi Trophy.
I must say that I think Lays lightly salted chips are even better than Lays classic chips because they give more of an actual spud twang in your pie hole. Although it would appear my touch screen is now just as smeared as it would be with the classic Lays.
Zuerlein has a leg like the guy with the big calves in the Liberty Mutual commercial.
Hey...am I pretty?
They have already signed Kardi B for next year's Super Bowl halftime show. Oh what's that? I misspelled it! You're kidding me! I couldn't have!
Edelman is an absolute fucking beast!
Super Bowl commercials pack an emotional wallop that I have heretofore only gleaned from Ingmar Bergman films.
Hey! I flew to another planet in the last 25 minutes and stared directly into one of their complete solar eclipses. Guess I missed the halftime show. Good?
Just taking a flyer right now in case it actually happens. I think Adam Levine will reveal his new Colin Kaepernick tat at half time.
If I'd hyper-ironically been stranded on a desert island a handful of times up to this point in my life, I would not watch this halftime show.
Which would you not watch more? This upcoming halftime show or the Oscars?
I'm mulling over a Super Bowl proposition bet on whether there will be more virtue signaling today or fair catch signaling. Hmm...
#superbowl #sunday #video #predictions #dennismilleroption https://t.co/qKjsvz8Spz
Now Northam is saying that when he contemplated moonwalking during the presser he was actually going to bust out his Neil Armstrong impression and was just eyeing the stage to see if there was room for the paper mâché LEM he brings out to heighten the effect of the "embodiment."
Go figure. Northam just left his wife because she wouldn't let him moonwalk. I guess the heart wants what it wants.
It’s disconcerting to think Einstein would have tweeted “E=MC2” today. #DennisMillerOption
Wow! This Michael Jackson documentary on HBO is simply unbelievable! Oh wait. Sorry, I’m watching the Ralph Northam press conference.
An incredible two headed transplant of George Orwell and Joseph McCarthy would have trouble believing where we have arrived at as a society.
I am now thinking Patriots. Brady and Belichick just make it impossible to imagine the other outcome.
Let's just say Governor Northam is so stiff he reminds me of a statue that should be torn down. #DennisMillerOption
I am going to try to parse what Northam is saying right now. He's saying he's both people in the photo.
I am pretty sure Northam is going to come out at this press conference and say the two individuals in the photo are Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge.
Can you imagine how bad Elizabeth Warren's internal polling must be for her to actually issue a real apology for lying about her heritage?
He's not going anywhere. Ralph Northam will give up the Governorship of Virginia when a meteorite hits Cuba.
Looks like Northam's career as Governor has been terminated in the 55th week. #DennisMillerOption
I just saw Bernie Sanders make his Super Bowl pick. He says he doesn't care who wins but apres game he wants the winning team to give as many of their points as necessary to the losing team so it ends up a tie. #superbowl
I am thinking of a dozen reasons why the Rams will win the Super Bowl. Thus, I'm picking the Patriots. Two reasons.
Big announcement coming 2.7.19! #DennisMillerOption https://t.co/YZq9BvJHf8
We live in a truly odd time where nobody can be fired for actually being inept at their job but everyone can be fired for a clumsy social media post.
Watching Trump get rolled by Pelosi is like watching Luke fetch the snapping turtle for Walkin' Boss. Let's hope he's nicked the truck keys.
Can't wait to get back to Looziana!	Sat Feb 9. 8 PM CST · L'Auberge Casino &amp; Hotel Baton Rouge · Baton Rouge, Louisiana Tix available thru Ticketmaster!
Trump in essence is saying “Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president."#LBDJT
Just announced! I’ll be performing at @KAABOOTexas May 10-12! Use promo code MILLER to save $20 on LONE STAR (GA) passes! Passes available at https://t.co/1rpCKfJFQq! See you there! https://t.co/FVPXONP3XA
Maybe he can once again offer reconciliation to Pelosi and her breakaway band of rebels and give the speech at Appomattox.
Ironically, no State of the Union Address is a perfect distillation of the State of the Union. #weshouldallstartseeingothercountriesnow
Had a lot of fun today on Rich Zeoli's show in Philly! https://t.co/cVdE2B0qkH
I am looking up at the moon with Clete Blakeman and he just asked me how often they’re blue like this?
I don’t think George Toma went to nine Super Bowls.
Think Goodell is proud that he (in conjunction with Arbitrator Harold Henderson) gave Greg Hardy and Tom Brady the same length suspension?
...AND ANN B. DAVIS AS ALICE!!!
What have we learned today? NFL, the league, is trolling football, the game.
The NFL is the biggest sport in America because they're smart enough to realize at this time in our history a Ref Driven league dovetails perfectly with our collective need to second guess.
Do I have this right? At 10:41 Central time tonight 13-year old Andy Reid is going to walk between me and the moon?
Variety headline. "NFL Referee Gary Cavaletto Signs Exclusive Contract To Be Permanent House Vocalist On The Masked Singer."
Let me say this about the non-call in the NFC championship game. I don't think Democrats have handled Hillary's loss as well as they could have.
Distilled down, L.A. is a bigger TV market than La. #NFCChampionshipGame
The NFL has the best officials in the world. Or so they’ll tell you. #lookwhatgoodellhasdonetothisleague
That’s hilarious!
At this point Rudy is so discombobulated he just became the first person in over a decade to get the "Fool me once shame on m...I mean you...Fool me twice shame on...uh...me...yeah, that's it...me" thing right.
Today's poll question on Drudge is "Do you believe Trump rigged the Drudge Poll?"
No doubt the Dems will officially impeach Trump "...for knowingly and willfully deleting 33K subpoenaed e-mails."
Nancy Pelosi to Trump: "Postpone State of the Union or Submit it in Written Form...and use two syllable words max as I'd like read it too."
How to return civility to the culture? Suspend anonymity on social media would be a good first step. #DennisMillerOption
He must rue the day he ever decided to jump in and try to honcho this goatfuck. Hire George Wells as Chief of Staff, insert a line item in the budget for "Dress Shoppe Across The Street Observation" and feather the Diamond Joystick backwards to June 15, 2015.
I wish all of us would come to day to day life with the same sense of wonderment that Ken Jeong brings to the moment he discovers that the bedazzled Minotaur singing "I'm Gonna Be" right in front of him is actually Rupert from "Survivor."
Looks like Bezos' one eye roved itself loose from its mooring.
Hopefully the Left will now begin to lionize Trump as if he’s Jack Reed.
The NFL needs more rules.
If they impeach Trump they no doubt have "Pence was born in Kenya" warming up in the bullpen.
All right, I'm getting into this late because I thought it was a joke. Do Dems believe Trump was born in Russia and sent here or did they flip him here as a teen in military school or did he flip himself at age 70 because the Communist light bulb went off?
Mike Pereira should be the next James Bond.
The Rams are blasting bigger holes in the Cowboys D-Line than there were in Hillary's 33,000 missing emails explanation.
Just try typing out “I think Donald Trump is a Russian Spy” and you feel silly.
Two things. I really don’t believe Trump is a Russian operative...could be but I don’t think. Next, I don’t think Democrats have handled Hillary’s loss as well as they could have.
I'd say it's time to...hmm...how do I say this? Time to fecally express oneself or get off the wall.
If there's a silver lining to the global economic slowdown it's gold prices.
Just ordered a Season Pass for the Scientology Networks new DIY show "This Old Engram."
Over/Under on # of days until an Alt-Band names themselves Bezos' Junk?

I see that Jeff Bezos announced this morning he and his wife are divorcing. In true Bezos fashion no doubt her settlement has already arrived. #jeffbezos
Me on Charlie Rose ages ago noticing he has no pants on. https://t.co/vm4lhoEJpU
Howz'about a mall at the southern border?
I just went to Gelsons and the shelves were so organized I’d have to guess that the stock boy is John Nash.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been placed on this planet for the sole purpose of making Nancy Pelosi appear to be Marilyn Vos Savant. #DennisMillerOption
No generation ever...repeat...EVER!!!!...has been this blown away by Chevy cars and trucks! Prove me wrong. I dare you!
There is no greater advertisement for wide brimmed hats than the candidates Arizona votes for as of late.
The NFL dines out on video overturning exciting plays in much the same way Cyril Wecht dined out on the Zapruder Film.
Just watching Rashida Tlaib deliver a Ted Talk on Telekinesis and a spoon she had focused on for 20 minutes bent her.
If the Democrat's are really serious about putting a truly representative member of their Party forward in 2020, they must choose Rashida Tlaib. To not do so will be sexist, Islamaphobic and not loyal to their core message.
To everyone looking for the #DennisMillerOption, thank you for your interest and don't worry, we’ll have a big announcement very soon! Moving to a better spot! Old episodes still available on iTunes….and…and…I’m pregnant!
You tell me. https://t.co/ZUqbo5NrNo
I have trouble going up stairs in clogs. Tips?
I guess kids today are as excited about Elizabeth Warren as the kids of my generation were excited about Bobby Kennedy...but as I said, I'm guessing.
The NFL needs more rules.

I think he wants out and he usually gets what he wants.
Just got behind the guy at the ATM who's shielding his 4-digit code from me like POTUS is down and there's an active shooter situation. Looks a lot like the guy who has to make the Sophie's Choice on whether or not to spring for the guac at Chipotle.
On an ALL-NEW #dennismilleroption, @RichLowry discusses what the midterms say Trump’s path to re-election, #Brexit &amp; #Macron. I also talk to @ChristianDMZ about #mathewgolsteyn, the Pope’s birthday, #LamarAlexander, the history of climate change and more! https://t.co/EHZc8QWYFa

Steph Curry won't believe in the moon landing until he sees an actual photo of Draymond Green kicking Neil Armstrong in the nads as he comes down the ladder from the LEM.
By the way, on the Chief of Staff front President Trump just exhumed Haldeman.
Cory Booker. “I’m Spurious...No, I’m Spurious!”
Nobody made the long mosey from Yale to y'all with less hitch in his giddy up than GHWB.
I’m trying to think of something Trump would delight in more than knowing he got so far into Hillary’s shark skull she told Bubba before they went to the church “If you get up and kiss Melania I’ll fucking kill you!” but I can’t. #DennisMillerOption MORE: https://t.co/sVJgsiHOv0

I'm not sure which is sadder...The Left making it a centerpoint moment in their buzzkill existence to put Jerome Corsi behind bars for the rest of his life or to make sure Apu is fired from the Quickie-Mart on "The Simpsons." #ahighercallingindeed
Just bought some tickets on Stubhub to see Bubba &amp; Hillary kvetch like "The Sunshine Boys." They're taking Mallo Cup Money in exchange for ducats. By the way (ironically) "Stub Hub" was the Secret Service name for the White House when Bill was POTUS. #DennisMillerOption

The coolest thing about NFL players is how they let you know in subtle ways that they’ve been there before and their small successes on any given play are really no big deal.
@boderek @festivalmeria Congrats my dear friend, Bo!
Anybody hear anything about Exorcisms on Groupon?
Most QB's don't complete as many handoffs as Drew Brees does passes.
DAMMIT! I'm just watching the Zapruder Film again for the umpteenth time to see if I missed anything and just as it gets to Frame 256 that gd Booger McFarland-mobile lurches right into the gd shot and murkys up the visual narrative! Dammit!
Wow! Vinny Chase really got ripped for the "A-Man" didn't he?
You see, Bernie Sanders, the Pilgrims shared their bounty with the Liz Warren's of their own volition and not because they were compelled to.
I'm watching the "Clinton Affair" episode entitled "Ha Ha! Clinton's Dick." Oh wait...I'm sorry I'm watching the Redskins playing a porous Cover Two against the Cowboys. Sorry. My bad...I thought he was still with the Packers.
There has never been a generation of young people that reacts in a more manic, shakily joyous manner to the roll out of new Chevys than this one. No wonder they think of Ocasio-Cortez as "A Woman Named Golda."
John Roberts just issued a proclamation stating that he believes Bruno Tonioli is the new Hammurabi and should be treated as such.#timeforsomenewscoringpaddles

In answer to the President, Global Warming (previously known as Global Cooling) is now known as Climate Change so all bases are covered.
John Roberts should just zip it and focus his time on completely missing the point on key judicial decisions.

Fittingly, I find Justice Roberts latest mandate taxing. #DennisMillerOption
Perhaps nothing speaks more pointedly to the belief chasm in this country right now than the fact that Rep. Ocasio-Cortez will have her pick of Honorary Doctorates in 2019 as they see her as a bit of a genius and the savior of this 240 year plus grand experiment. Go figure.
No stuffing on the Thanksgiving menu this year as I don't want to be accused of fat-shaming the turkey.
Hey, let's all welcome Abby Huntsman to "The Skew"!
And while we're at it...why isn't Ocasio-Cortez in the Concussion Protocol?
Putting together my first 2019 Mock Draft and I'm wondering if anyone can provide me with a Wonderlic score for Ocasio-Cortez?
I'm surprised a number of Democrats want Avenatti to run for President as a Democrat in 2020. I know they want a Democrat fighter to go against Trump but really they should rethink him as their Democrat candidate. Am I right? #DennisMillerOption
On an ALL-NEW #DennisMillerOption, I have a wonderful conversation with @BenMank77 about Old Hollywood and classic films, including the great work he and everyone does @tcm, the amazing history of his family, Howard Hawks, Orson Welles and so much more! https://t.co/2CvtSt7MCQ

Bill Nelson has a pair of Brendan Fraser Film scarab beetles hatching progeny in his ethmoid sinuses. I know...I know...WTF is that about Dennis?
Can't wait to see Rocky Pi!
Rick Scott now demanding yet another recount! Can't believe he only beat Humpbrow by 10K!
Now Bill Nelson can get back to his true calling, attempting (and failing) to bend spoons with his mind and distending his frontal lobes in the process.
The Cleveland Browns have just hired the incorporeal being of Dean Rusk as their new Quality Control Coach!
DeSantis should say he accepted Gillum’s first concession but refuses to accept this one.
Stacey Abrams seems like an incredibly long day. #DennisMillerOption
Acosta is easier to see thru than the plastic lanyard that holds his newly reactivated press pass. #DennisMillerOption
On an ALL-NEW #DennisMillerOption, I talk to @ChristianDMZ about why I think Trump wants out, meeting @JuddApatow, @DocGooden16, and Charlton Heston (Separately), my first impression of Harvey Weinstein, Woodstock, seeing the reunited Zeppelin and more! (https://t.co/TcqQ4OO4tk

Jim Acosta SPEAKS TRUTH TO POWER! In lieu of any other discernible talent.
Imagine going on "Jimmy Kimmel Show" to promote my new comedy special with a man who I disagree with on many things politically but treated me genially and respectfully and hearing from a "fan" that I "had his cock in my mouth." No wonder I march to the beat of my own drummer.
Why don't Republicans immediately file for a reciprocal number of recounts in each election cycle to let the Dems know they're onto them? Because they're more whipped than a Pre-Fish Mr. Limpet. #wakeupyouacquiescentstiffs
Want to know how grim it is? Watch Lou Dobbs right now attempting to laugh his way thru his inner shatterhood.
Do you want to know how screwed Republicans are? The fact that right-leaning pundits and pols continue to debate whether it's incompetence or corruption in Broward County tells you they haven't even fully entered the fray. Conservative movement in America is now Margaret DuMont.
On an ALL-NEW #DennisMillerOption, I talk to the great @KurtSchlichter about the #MidtermElections2018, and how well-positioned @realDonaldTrump is for 2020. I also talk to @ChristianDMZ about #BohemianRhapsody, preparing for @JimmyKimmelLive and more!https://t.co/EWViulDF0n
Had the best time with @JimmyKimmel tonight! #Kimmel @JimmyKimmelLive #ABC
Paul Ryan is ostensibly a friend who can only make Trump look bad. Pelosi is an enemy who can only make Trump look good.
Watching Pelosi now. Nobody represents modern Liberalism more accurately. "Let's hear it more for pre-existing conditions!" Perfect!
I'd rather Pelosi than Paul Ryan.
I saw the “Bohemian Rhapsody “ tonight. Congrats to Rami Malek! Killed it!
Pelosi will show so well over the next two years it can only help Dems! She’s the best and self aware enough to know how far she should take the rancor!
Real winners tonight? Our Founding Fathers for birthing this amazing system!
Congrats Dems on just taking the House and congrats President Trump on just winning re-election in 2020.
On an all new #DennisMillerOption, I give my #MidtermElection2018 predictions, share some thoughts on the #NFL and plan for my appearance on @JimmyKimmelLive. I also chat with @ChristianDMZ about @starwars, @Mets, the perfection of “The Sting” and more! https://t.co/VRVVjjhwwF
Trump is certainly the hardest working President I've seen.
Candidly, a lot of times I ask fake questions on social media to wind up asshats but I'm asking this one non-ironically. Citizens of Florida...you have no state income tax but you might vote Gillum in because you want one? Why do you want one?
We're ONE day away from "Fake News, Real Jokes!" premiere! Make sure you vote, and you pre-ordered my special on Apple https://t.co/xKFg7Jeb59
Hey, if the Dems take back the House I do get back my CA. state and local tax write offs reinstated, right? I'm asking for a friend.
Am I pretty?
Hmm? Why doesn't Jones pantomime that "Brush Off The Lapels" thing after he fumbles?
...and you want to know something else about this Patriot-Packer game? I don't think the Democrats have handled Hillary's loss as well as they could have.
Belichick using Patterson as he's doing is why he's the greatest coach ever. Just win baby.
The fact that this Election might even be close shows how far gone the country is. #DennisMillerOption More : link in bio

Buck and Smoltz...THE ADRENALINE DENIERS!
Dave Roberts just took Bogart out of "Casablanca."
When Joe Buck looks away from Smoltz and back at me reassuringly in case I think he's forgotten about me, I want to become a Trappist Monk and never glimpse a fucking TV for the rest of time.
Time to kick back and watch a little World Series with a timely cocktail. 1/2 part Bolsonaro, 1 part vodka, ½ part Tangerine liqueur, 1 part Pineapple juice, Splash lemon juice.
Ty Montgomery is obviously not a big Nick Buoniconti fan.
Dave Roberts just took Jared Goff out of the Rams game.
The Good Guys finally brought down Apu on the "Simpsons!" Great work! Go keep on gettin' 'em!

We should all just be thankful that at this moment it would appear that Sayoc is an even bigger fuck-up than Hodgkinson was.

I recently read a rumor that a reboot of "All In The Family" was afoot. (See what I did there?) If so, may I suggest Billy Bush and Megyn Kelly as the leads and the character of "Meathead" could be played by actor Rob Reiner. #DennisMillerOption
Watching "Titanic" for the first time since I saw it in a theater. I had kinda forgotten how really great Leonardo D. Is in it!

What's with all these female high school faculty members having trysts with their male students? I remember when teachers would only let you bang the erasers.
Face saving? Elizabeth Warren now insisting in a previous life she was Jim Thorpe and she wants her medal back. #DennisMillerOption More Rants: https://t.co/aZSzk8HQCn
I never thought that any human being (much less your's truly) would ever type the following. "Ben Sasse is a less menschy Jeff Flake." Sorry...he made me do it. #DennisMillerOption
Will Hillary take the #2 slot if Avenatti offers it to her? Just spitballin'...#DennisMillerOption

Oh for god's sake! I'm pretty sure George Custer had more American Indian blood than that.
Dammit! I just left my Ray-Bans in my Uber! I go thru eyewear like Moe Greene.
This Elizabeth Warren press release can mean only one thing. She's about to sue some poor bastard for residual casino ownership shares.
Esiason speaking Truth to Cowher.
Listened to some of Kanye’s music today. It’s cool!

Wow, the economy is great!
If Trump's entire administration is indeed one big sieve and we're going to hear about everything anyway, he should install a 24/7 cam in the Oval and start a Pay-Per-View service called "The Trump Network"...or maybe ESTN. #DennisMillerOption
This has to be the first era in human history where people who are constantly positioned as "strong" whine so much.
Congrats Osaka! Wow!
Boy I'm having a good hair day! Musta been something that happened close to ten years ago! #DennisMillerOption
I see Andy Reid today took credit for last night's Eagle victory. I guess it's going around.
Dems must be orgasmic about Corymala2020...right?
What happened to the "Silent" thing? Cal Coolidge has also now claimed credit for the Trump Economy! #DennisMillerOption
On an ALL-NEW #DennisMillerOption, @SpikeFeresten joins myself and @ChristianDMZ to talk about working at @NBCSNL, Letterman, Space Ghost, writing "Seinfeld"'s Soup Nazi episode, Aretha Franklin's funeral, the boycotts of In N Out and Nike and more! https://t.co/LWmF0qHm5Z
I believe the Dems in 2020 will choose someone who articulates their current approach to politics. Perhaps Donald Segretti.
Hey, am I way off here or are Liberals not handling Hillary’s loss as well as they could have? #DennisMillerOption

I prefer the flat-billed, trucker type "Handmaid's Tale" habits to the curved ones I'm seeing the gals wear in the Trump protests. C'mon ladies!
Just saw "The Lieutenant of Inishmore." Brilliantly funny! Poldark should be the next Bond.
Hmm...I'll be intrigued to see what happens if it happens.
Hmm...Mueller just subpoenaed Trump's Rose Law Firm records.
On an ALL-NEW #DennisMillerOption, we talk about the @Astros, the TV shows Lost and 24, Saudi Arabia, Steven Seagal, James Whitmore and @StarTrek. Then @ForcedExit Wesley Smith joins @ChristianDMZ and I to discuss moving to DC, end-of-life issues and more. https://t.co/VvTabnLPFg
I just had free range chicken for lunch. While it was delicious, I did note that the bird was deceased and on my plate. Exactly how free was that range?
Off grid. Not really up to speed. Is Trump in prison or back in Manhattan and hosting "The Apprentice"? How's President Pence doing or did they go with Hillary? I'm not all that sure about the order of succession.
Well, amidst the fog, only one thing appears to be certain at this point. President Pence's first Supreme Court Nominee will almost certainly be Amy Coney Barrett and not President Tump's probable choice Thomas Hardiman. #definitionofpyrrhic
Come to Live! Casino &amp; Hotel on August 25th for a night raw commentary, with a hint of sarcasm and plenty of laughs. It’s time for you to sit back and enjoy my show. Get your tickets now: https://t.co/QsfX3mqol6
I'm in Europe, a tad off the grid but I'm assuming Trump has stepped down already, right?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're telling me then private citizen/candidate Donald Trump authorized his attorney to pay off two women he had affairs with? How can that be?
On an ALL-NEW #DennisMillerOption, I talk about Pet Sounds, Ann Margret, male cheerleaders in the NFL, counseling for Mets fans like @ChristianDMZ and we also take your calls and answer questions from the mailbag! https://t.co/8b6VY4sHEE
All so confusing. Don’t jump me here because I’m just asking a serious question that deserves a serious answer. Hillary is President, right?
Tough week. John Brennan just had his TCBY Loyalty Card zeroed out.
Not kidding here. Serious question, just looking for a civil, informed answer from someone on either side of the aisle. What has Trump done wrong again and is it an impeachable offense?
If they bring Trump down on January 21st, 2019 Pence gets ten years, right?
I'm now shaking my head side to side and thinking "Wow...what a world" a good 17 to 20 times a day.
Let’s be candid. A lot of these posts are just for shits and giggles but the next one? You can take the next one to the bank! I don’t think Liberals have handled Hillary’s loss as well as they could have.
If Time Magazine is to maintain any of it's former glory it will name Omarosa Manigault its Person of the Year!
Hear me now and believe me later...I don't think Liberals have handled Hillary's loss as well as they could have.
Hey, does anyone know if we’ve revoked Aldrich Ames security clearance yet? #DennisMillerOption
If he fired Jeff Sessions he could introduce a new piece into the clothing line, the M.A.G.G.A. hat. #DennisMillerOption

I believe Paul Ryan will be the Democratic nominee for President in 2020 and he will select Omarosa as his running mate.
Just heard an ad on the TV for a new "Magnum P.I." No doubt a woman this time.
I like Rudy Giuliani but he seems dinged to me. Not Pelosi dinged but nonetheless dinged.
Al Sharpton thinking of throwing his hat into the ring in 2020. I'm guessing he didn't purchase the hat at Freddy's Fashion Mart.
On an ALL-NEW #DennisMillerOption, I talk about hosting the @MTV Awards (twice!), working with Wesley Snipes and late night TV. Then, @ChristianDMZ and I are joined by Christian Toto of @HollywoodInToto to talk summer movies and look ahead to the fall. https://t.co/P8gSWoKHKk
Nothing funnier than true believers anointing some gormless asshat a "Rock Star!"
Oscars just announced yet another category for "Best Drivers Ed Film.
Sit back and watch as the Left transforms Omarosa into Clare Boothe Luce.
I believe Paul Ryan will be the Democratic nominee for President in 2020.
Just read an article on Drudge about how Democrats were highly optimistic and encouraged by last night's election results. So as a concillatory gesture let me say to the Dems congrats on a great night!
On an ALL-NEW #DennisMillerOption, I discuss fires and global warming, Trump and his kids, David Bowie, Freddie Mercury and more. @ChristianDMZ and I also go to the phones to talk to some listeners, including our old friend @GeneBarretta! Listen for free: https://t.co/ynhGztVtod
Now I'm starting to actually wonder about Global Warming but there's no one to talk to about it as they're all onto the Russian chew toy. Damn.
I can't seem to find Jim Acosta on this damned Standard/Metric Tool Conversion Chart. Anybody? Little help here! How big a tool is he?

For some reason, probably the obvious one(s), Pelosi was just placed in the NFL's Concussion Protocol. #DennisMillerOption
After an adult lifetime of watching Joe Biden, I would say his super power is that it's damn near impossible to determine if he's presently losing his fastball. #DennisMillerOption
I can never totally figure out is Jim Acosta reminds me more of David Shuster or Rick Sanchez...probably Shuster. #DennisMillerOption
Senator Richard Blumenthal is by far the most righteous individual who’s ever lied about serving in Vietnam.
He's a king mixer.
Musing on the 2020 Election. Now obviously the Democrats are the party of youth so it's fairly obvious that with Biden and Bernie being 78 and 79 respectively at that point they'll probably go with the Kid, Hillary who'll only be 73. Right?
On an ALL-NEW #DennisMillerOption, I chat with my friend Patty Smyth about Scandal, working with Don Henley, Neil Young and so much more. Then, @ChristianDMZ discuss Shaq, #BigMac50, soy beans, bacon, Africa, #RuthBaderGinsburg, Nabakov and Gore Vidal.  https://t.co/WHYVi2qq8a
Just asking. Will Trump be impeached and for what reason? #dennismilleroption
Jeff Sessions always sounds like a ventriloquist who isn't within vague hailing distance of mastering his craft.
This is the calmest day I can remember of the Trump presidency. I guess on the day between his EU score and tomorrow's expected smoking GDP number even the Libs feel they should probably zip it today. That's not good. I prefer it when they're clueless.
Odd to think that there are people in this country who won't be able to get out of bed tomorrow if the GDP is 4% or above.
On an ALL-NEW #DennisMillerOption, I react to Trump's EU press conference, then I talk to Curt Schilling @Gehrig38 about the bloody sock, Johnny Podres, Greg Maddux and a little politics. Finally, @ChristianDMZ and I answer your mailbag questions.	https://t.co/RSWYYjzrZl
Deep cover doesn't get any deeper than what Trump is laying down to get people off the trail of his obvious status as a Russian spy and a committed Communist.
Nobody has ever exploded more heads than Trump.
Tellingly, many internet trolls seem to share an arrogant "Haven't been there, haven't done that" attitude.
Obviously if the Dems take back the House in November they will pretty quickly re-nuclearize North Korea in the name of world peace. We should resist that.
The Democratic Party evidently, startlingly, seems set on doing away with ICE which ironically portends they'll next have power when Hell freezes over. #DennisMillerOption
The latest #DennisMillerOption is a great chat with my friend John Corbett, who talks about some fascinating jobs he had before his big break, meeting Vincent Price, getting cast on Northern Exposure, Sex and the City, meeting @BoDerek, and so much more! https://t.co/4xBle2JhMM
Forget wind farms. Start hooking up cables to the spinning heads of the Never Trumpers...an instantaneous power glut.
What a day, what a day, what a day! Just picked up a 1926-S Elizabeth Warren Head Nickel at auction for 3,450.00 !!!!!
I think the Democrats know that Liz Warren is by far their best choice for 2020 and if they just get out of their own way and select her right now she'll win 49 out of the 50 states. Right?
Trump has gotten so far into "Mourning Joe's" kitchen they had to knock out the far wall.
I think it's fair to say Trump has invented Twitter.
James Comey hedges more than Ray Dalio taking an adult education Bonsai gardening class being taught by the farm agent from "Green Acres." By the way, I know...I'm old. Conversely, you about to type that I'm old are young and yet somehow fixated on my every throwaway musing.
Wow, Rory Gallagher could rock! Check out "Rouhani The Day"...great!
I know you think I’m kidding but I truly don’t think Liberals have reacted as well as they might have to Hillary’s defeat.
The NFL couldn’t be anymore in the Killing The Golden Goose business if they were Auric Goldfinger’s Executive Chef the day before Thanksgiving.
Hope all these Liberal pacifists don’t yahoo us into a nuclear war here. Notch back on your blueblood lust, please! #ToServeManItsACookbook
Have you ever noticed that people who constantly ask for context on jokes are the same folks who also never have a clue.
The noise emanating from a Whoopee Cushion isn't as off putting as that was.
Henceforth all snowflakes will be known as jeffflakes! So it is written...so it shall be done!
Where is this planet where every President save this one hasn't lied? Trump haters should not draw a red line on this assertion as I believe there is recent precedent to dispel that myth. By the way, George Washington actually felled an apple tree. #DennisMillerOption
On an ALL-NEW #DennisMillerOption, @ChristianDMZ and I talk #TrumpPutinSummit, Robin Williams and golfing with @AliceCooper. Then, @RealAJBenza discusses Donald Trump, Harvey Weinstein, Anthony Bourdain, Liza Minelli, Nicholas Cage, Johnny Depp, and more! https://t.co/PZ5OiP9S3a
Wow, Clinton didn't even turn off the lights in the Oval when he was repurposing the Cohibas!
Well, I know it's July and not May and it hasn't been a week yet but it would appear Trump's detractors see him as Jordan Lyman, although I'm not sure they've settled on who their Gen. James Mattoon Scott is yet.
On an ALL-NEW #DennisMillerOption, @ChristianDMZ and I discuss France's win in the #WorldCupFinal, Anthony Bourdain's final interview and Trump's UK trip. Then, @AdamCarolla discusses his own UK travels, George Clooney, Adam "Pac Man" Jones and more!  https://t.co/7ErseZTOGu
On an ALL-NEW #DennisMillerOption, @ChristianDMZ and I discuss Kirk Douglas, Jerry Lewis, Brandon Tartikoff, Grant Tinker and more. Also, @DebraJSaunders talks about life as a White House Correspondent and catching a glimpse of Kim Jong Un in Singapore. https://t.co/63rWj0M3Ua
Whew, Trump plays hardball! He just told Merkel to pay her 2% NATO vig by repurposing what's left of the Brandenburg Gate as a intra-city toll booth.
I'm thinking Germany sees President Trump less as Neville Chamberlain in Munich and more as Wilt Chamberlain in Hershey, PA. #DennisMillerOption
If England wins this game Meghan might leave Harry for Harry. #WorldCup2018
I certainly hear the hyper-dramatic hue and cry (like an incessant car alarm) in the background but the simple fact is Kavanaugh's a fait accompli, right? I mean, he's in already in, isn't he? I'm asking for a friend...America.
Fun, huh?
I think the reason the President chose Kavanaugh yesterday is that perchance Justice Ginsburg does step down, Trump as a fair man would feel obligated to replace a woman on the court with another woman. #DennisMillerOption
Hey, in an ironic nutshell, it’s Trump’s right to choose.
Watching the World Cup and I haven't seen this many bruised shin(n)s since George got caught in a two year relationship with one of his own team's cheerleaders. I know, I know...it's infuriating!
The Left is way ahead in the Restaurant Confrontation Column. The Right is building a reciprocal lead in the Supreme Court Justice Column. Duty is in the eye of the beholder.
On an ALL-NEW #DennisMillerOption, @ChristianDMZ and I are joined in studio by Clint Howard, who talks about his parents, working with his brother @RealRonHoward, @StarWars, @StarTrek, Gentle Ben, Bonanza, Apollo 13, meeting Walt Disney and much more! https://t.co/dRVsblEank
Dear Dems. It should assuage your pain to realize certainly that must be it for Trump as far as Supreme Court picks go. Right? I mean can anyone even imagine a scenario where he might get one more?
Hear that horn? Kavalry comin' over the hill!
Reducing current political terms down as far as they can go, it would appear X = people with two jobs don't want to pay for people with zero jobs anymore.
...not since the Pens were sittin' on the #1 Pick in '84 with Lemieux staring back at them from the board...
If it's true that Bill and Hillary Clinton are now flying commercially, she's definitely running against Trump in 2020. Granted, she knows that she'll lose again but by FLYING COMMERCIALLY!!! she's telling us she will run yet again in 2024...and lose to Pence.#FLYINGCOMMERCIALLY!
Time saving tip. You need not begin to listen to a John Kasich sentence until you hear the word "but." He hedges more bets than Wes Studi in "Mystery Men." #DennisMillerOption
Just to keep things in perspective, or not, Trump could nominate either Amy Coney Barrett or Vladimir Putin tomorrow and the headlines would be exactly the same. #DennisMillerOption
Hear me now and believe me later. I don't think the Liberals have handled Hillary's loss as well as they could have. #DennisMillerOption
The best thing about soccer is that due to the paucity of scoring you can not watch it for a half-hour and kinda still be watching it.
It’s so hot right now in SoCal I just saw an iguana with a parasol.
The Mayor of London is to terrorism what the Mayor of Amity was to sharks.
What are the odds Trump tells the pilot on Air Force One to do a "Top Gun" Fly-by and sever the tethers on the Baby Trump Blimp as they come into London?
I think Schumer is pissing in the wind with the Merrick Garland ask. He'd be better off asking Trump to appoint Judge Reinhold.
On an all-new #DennisMillerOption, @ChristianDMZ and I discuss some fine films, all-time great comedians, William Shatner hosting SNL, LeBron James' new tax bracket, Joss Whedon and more. Also, @NickDiPaolo returns to promote his new podcast: https://t.co/GTDBq3BNv6
On an ALL-NEW #DennisMillerOption, @ChristianDMZ and I talk about James Caan, Sam Kinison, Batman, Godzilla, "Dr. No" and more! We also have a lovely chat with my friend @BoDerek about her life, horses, Hollywood and her man, John Corbett. https://t.co/p4Dy6O4WSY
Michael Cohen is as sure as his pardon from Trump as Mark Rich was of his pardon from Clinton.
The Golden State Warriors have a very precise list that's been made public of 25 free agents that their next signee will definitely come from. #SmallVictories
Liberals are using the Golden State Warriors to rehearse packing the Supreme Court. #DennisMillerOption
That's the Bay Area for you. Share the wealth as long as it's not theirs.
The Golden State One-Percenters should share some of their players with the more disenfranchised teams in the NBA, shouldn't they?
If Trump wins a second term and ends up also replacing Breyer, remaining holdouts Sotomayor and Kagan might as well sign on with Netflix to do a "Laverne and Shirley" remake. #DennisMillerOption
When you look in the rearview, filibustering Gorsuch is starting to resemble not giving the ball to Marshawn Lynch on 2nd down at the one yard line in SB 49.
I would assume Trump is going to nominate his second most indisputable candidate for the Supreme Court this time thru and save his most indisputable candidate for the next time thru, right?
Alexi Lalas is being so gracious re Russia's upset of Spain in the World Cup that he'll no doubt have a Mueller subpoena awaiting him upon his arrival back home in the States.
Spain’s World Cup team passes more than ? playing in the World Series of Poker. Need an individual known for being overly cautious. Hmm...I'm going to say General George McClellan. What say you?
As if it's not hard enough to score in soccer, they have an offside rule that's seemingly more oppressive than the Prima Noctae Law.
I've looked at this from each and every angle and I come up with the same answer each and every time. I don't think Liberals have handled Hillary's loss as well as they could have. #DennisMillerOption
Trump has become Meet John Dough. #DennisMillerOption
Watching the reaction to Justice Kennedy’s retirement and I’d have to think Trump is going ahead with Space Force because he sees such a deep recruiting pool of Space Cadets. #DennisMillerOption
On an all-new #DennisMillerOption, @ChristianDMZ and I discuss #JusticeKennedy, #MitchMcConnell, the original @StarTrek pilot, #DavidBowie and more. Plus, @GarySinise tells us about all the great work going on at the @GarySiniseFound. https://t.co/ICMD57xNol
Ahem...
I'm pretty sure Justice Ginsburg will still be going strong at the end of Trump's first term and probably even at the end of his second term. Maybe even at the end of Pence's first term. Not so sure about the end of Pence's second term/beginning of Ivanka's first term.
Finally something we agree on! VOTE!
Remembering what Ted Kennedy had to say about Robert Bork, perhaps today's announcement can be classified as Surname Comeuppance. #DennisMillerOption
I believe the official name of the syndrome is Judge Dread. #DennisMillerOption
Oh boy...
Still waters run deep...Maxine Waters, uhh...not so much.
Kevin Durant is expected to opt out of his Golden State Warrior contract this summer and sign with 1983 Grenada Invading Ronald Reagan.
I just saw this weeks "Star Wars" film about Chewie's second cousin Eddie who's an insurance fraud investigator in Modesto, CA. and I thought it was great!
Kevin Durant is expected to opt out of his Golden State Warrior contract this summer and sign with 1967 Six Day War Israel.
Hmm...makes me wonder if the Westboro Baptist Church imagined themselves to be as noble as some of these people do?
Kevin Durant is expected to opt out of his Golden State Warrior contract this summer and sign with the 1927 NY Yankees.
It would appear I've picked up a new job in the last week. Leaving the room for a moment so a team can score in the World Cup. #DennisMillerOption
On the latest #DennisMillerOption, @ChristianDMZ and I discuss a great weekend in Knoxville filming my new special #FakeNewsRealJokes, then, headlines about #SarahHuckabeeSanders, #MaxineWaters and more. Plus, we chat with the always funny @NickDiPaolo!   https://t.co/vOpsWS8v2C
Is Maxine Waters saying there should be separate water fountains for Republicans?
Looking forward to being on Kennedy's show tonight! @KennedyNation
On an all-new #DennisMillerOption, @ChristianDMZ and I talk about reading, happiness, #WorldCup, #SpaceForce and more. Then, our friend @LarryOConnor of The @WashTimes &amp; @WMALDC discusses #PeterStrzok, and the media's coverage of the #ImmigrationCrisis. https://t.co/9IYqRKTDIG
I hereby nominate Casper Van Dien to be the first Head of Space Force!
Hate to be a buzzkill but to all of you who want to get back at Peter Fonda at the box office? His track record would seem to indicate he's... uhh...let's say...he's un-boycottable. #DennisMillerOption
On an all-new #DennisMillerOption, I talk comedy with @ChristianDMZ, reminiscing about Rick Overton, Sam Kinison and Robin Williams. Then, we're joined by the great @VDHanson to discuss #NorthKoreaSummit, #Iran, #Trump, #TaxCuts and more! https://t.co/q4jlL6TPjG
Just started watching the golf today and it seems to me the USGA has made this course way too easy for a US Open course. #USOpenChampionship
Wow, what a coincidence! My CB handle is Yappy Barn Rat! #USOpen2018
Comey's at a jammy party tonight with Sandy and Rizz dreaming of beauty school. #DennisMillerOption
The last piece they don't control is Trump. #DennisMillerOption
I'm typing "Bastille" into Wayz. #DennisMillerOption
Is there an avoirdupois Fail Safe point you cannot fly thru and still refer to your personal computer as a "laptop?" #DennisMillerOption
"Chick" Gandil, Eddie Cicotte, "Lefty" Williams, Shoeless Joe Jackson, FBI Director Chris Wray, "Happy" Felsch, Swede Risberg, Buck Weaver and Fred McMullin. #NineMenOut
If you're tooling around Washington DC tonight you best procure the services of Tenzing Norgay The Sixth to get you over the crest of what's just been swept under the rug. #DennisMillerOption
All right, it's over now. Time to move on. She's going to skate until she eventually kicks in a Las Vegas hotel room door to collect her bobbleheads. In the interim, Trump's the Prez and she isn't. #DennisMillerOption
On an ALL-NEW #DennisMillerOption, @StephenFHayes of The @WeeklyStandard and I discuss The #NorthKoreaSummit and #CharlesKrauthammer. Then, @ChristianDMZ and I talk about #MarkSanford,#ScottPruitt &amp; #DeNiro. Finally we answer a question about #Hitchcock : https://t.co/fRBkFzEHEK
See you Saturday night Montclair, NJ.!	The Wellmont Theater	Saturday, June 16th	Doors: 7:00 pm
I think Trump should fire Sessions and say it was the only thing that Kim Jong Un requested other than ending the war games. #DennisMillerOption
"And if you go chasing rabbits, and you know you're going to fall	Tell 'em a hookah-smoking Canadian eyebrow has given you the call..." #DennisMillerOption
Well, Trump never said he was going to denuclearize his Mark Sanford tweets. #DennisMillerOption
On an ALL-NEW #DennisMillerOption, Rock and Roll Hall of Famer @GeneSimmons talks #Obama, #Trump, His Vault Experience, cannabis, Kiss toilet seats and more. @ChristianDMZ and I also discuss #NorthKoreaSummit, #DeNiro and your questions from the mailbag!  https://t.co/wXVDrMnodG
There are rumors that Kim Jong Un might request McDonalds franchises in North Korea as a way of introducing Western ways to his country. I would tell his citizenry they don't know what they're not missing. #DennisMillerOption
Hope KJU remembered to set his watch 25 years minus 1 hour ahead. #DennisMilerOption
They don’t want Trump tweeting because frankly he’s the best tweeter on the planet. #DennisMillerOption
Every time I hear Bernie Sanders speak publicly he wants people like me to share something with him. So here you go. You're a shithead. #DennisMillerOption
Trump is truly a Bull Market in a china shop. #DennisMillerOption
Nothing funnier than watching Trump treat the French like the French treat everybody. #DennisMillerOption
Hilarious! He's a genius! A virtuoso! #DennisMillerOption
Looks like Trudeau went thru his sock drawers today like Julian went thru his shirt drawers in "American Gigolo." #DennisMillerOption
Notice that Trump's detractors often agree with him on policy until they reach the word "but" midway thru their answer and then commence to trashin'. #DennisMillerOption
On the fifth episode of the Bathrobe Sessions, I answer a question about comedy. #DennisMillerOption https://t.co/8Vt0cw3Cgc
Everyone will come to a point in life where they must stand and fight to the end over an issue they hold nearer and dearer than all others. MSNBC has arrived at that sacred crossroads with Joy Reid. #DennisMillerOption
On an ALL-NEW #DennisMillerOption, @ChristianDMZ and I discuss #BillClinton's lack of apologies, #DennisRodman headed to #NorthKoreaSummit, #MitchMcConnell, #Putin, #LeBronJames, #StephCurry and more! Plus, your comments in the mailbag!  https://t.co/Eay1NQGWJA
If Trump gets Kim Jong Un to take up golf and wear Payne Stewart pants I'll never quit laughing. #DennisMillerOption
I'll be appearing on the @KennedyNation show tonight on the Fox Business Network at 8PM EST. I'm usually on halfway thru the hour. #DennisMillerOption
At the very least I hope Trump persuades Kim Jong Un to lose that Single Kit Kat Segment hair cut. #DennisMillerOption
Ironically, when I hear Robert DeNiro talking about politics my first instinct is to look over my shoulder and say "You talkin' to me?" #DennisMillerOption
The Customer Acquisition Cost on Social Media for people who detest you is far more equitable than for people who like you. #DennisMillerOption
Shit...Andrew Cuomo just rescinded my invite to White Castle. #DennisMillerOption
I've written an essay that's now up on #Breitbart
I'm thinking of inviting Bill Clinton on my Podcast #DennisMillerOption as soon as I can get an industrial strength vinyl slip cover made for the guest chair.
For Lebron to say definitively that Golden State will not be visiting the White House is spot on! #TrumpsPollingRising
On today's first of TWO all-new episodes of The #DennisMilerOption from @PodcastOne this week, @ChristianDMZ and I discuss #Trump and the #Eagles, #BillClinton's non-apology, changes to #MissAmerica, the Left's love affair with #Obama and more!  https://t.co/vBR9CfoYJf
As a member of "the world" I don't accept Bill Clinton's apology. I'm giving it back in hopes he gives it to her because she's the only one who deserves it. #DennisMillerOption
Hmm...does anyone else think the NFL resembles a Stradivarius these days? #DennisMillerOption
Sensitive man of the people Howard Schultz is eyeing campaign office space In Oklahoma City! #DennisMillerOption
Bill Clinton is explaining away his creepy Today Show interview by saying he got "hot under the collar." Yeah? Better get some ice on that. #DennisMillerOption
In essence, Terry McAuliffe just announced he’s running for President on the Democratic side. #DennisMillerOption
Can't decide whether to watch a rerun of the famous "Who Shot JR?" episode of "Dallas" tonight on TVLand or the "Why Didn't JR Shoot?" second game of the NBA Finals. Hmm? #NBAFinals #DennisMillerOption
The instant Ben Rhodes was rendered speechless by the election of a candidate he didn't favor he secured a gig on MSNBC. Congrats Ben! I...uh...I...uh...I...#DennisMillerOption
They’re winning the War of Trivialities. It’s akin to be the Valedictorian in Summer School. Sit back and enjoy it...note it...remember it...then settle it. #DennisMillerOption
Everyone who says Trump should quit tweeting does so on Twitter. #DennisMillerOption
Shaggy is the first out of tune rapper I’ve heard.
Wow! Lotta moving parts here! ABC has just hired Joy Reid to replace Roseanne on the "Roseanne" show! #DennisMillerOption
Progressives are shooting themselves in the foot more frequently than a centipede who quite frankly is "getting no relief whatsoever" from a topical application of a generic anti-fungal toenail cream. #DennisMillerOption
MSNBC is no doubt in talks to give Pyrrhus his own show. #DennisMillerOption
Fun!
Hey, if you find yourself hoping that the Korean Peninsula doesn't denuclearize because it would reflect favorably on President Trump, you do realize that's getting too weird, right? #DennisMillerOption
Go get 'em President Trump! #DennisMillerOption

Leafing thru some of my collectible issues of Mad Magazine and I'd have to say my favorite recurrent feature was "Informant vs. Informant."
Ahh, the sweet irony of Hillary now being known as the Clinton with the bulge under the clothing! #DennisMillerOption
Check out episode four of the #BathrobeSessions, where I discuss suicide bombers and virgins. #DennisMillerOption  https://t.co/k4p6xLkCzT

Fun to watch Pros negotiate all this stuff instead of Theorists. #DennisMillerOption

Wow! Mueller is now looking into Trump’s Whitewater ties. #DennisMillerOption
See you tomorrow night Milwaukee! https://t.co/jfskrZrwvb

I think I’m going to watch this “Real Housewives of Windsor Castle“ thing this weekend! #DennisMillerOption
On the latest #DennisMillerOption, it's a free-associative stroll with @ChristianDMZ, including conversation about Jack Nicholson, Chevy Chase, the Titanic, the border wall, North Korea, legalized sports gambling and your comments and questions!	 https://t.co/TKZrsVVnu2
Tebow is the man!
I’m on “Kennedy” on FBN in ten minutes or so.

Clever genital blocking cross promotion between "Naked And Afraid" and Post-It Extreme Notes. #nodoubtdondraperidea
Attention Vice-Admiral Farley C. Barnswell. Awaiting your pick for this Saturday's Preakness!
OMG! John Kerry just gave Kamal Kharazi the First Impression Rose! #DennisMillerOption
Ever so slowly but surely he's forcing them to tap out. #DennisMillerOption
I reiterate. I really don't think the Left is handling Hillary's loss all that well. No...I'm not kidding.
On episode #3 of the Bathrobe Sessions, I talk about hecklers. https://t.co/2Ru243IryM
Why Singapore as the site of the Summit? I won't even parrot "a few reasons." Simply put, the McDonalds in the Fajar Center on the outskirts of Singapore proper is thought to be the only Arches in the world that NEVER rotates the McRib off of the core menu. #DennisMillerOption
"Who do you want answering the phone at 3AM?" Uh...President Trump. You see, he'll still be up...you know...returning from Andrews with the three Americans he just sprung from Batshit-vania.  #DennisMillerOption
No doubt these three gentleman arriving home from North Korea tonight will be the first trio to arrive here in years that Liberals will demand to see Proof of Citizenship from. #DennisMillerOption
Imagine how rough things would be right now if the Democrats didn't all secretly love President Trump. #DennisMillerOption
So cool! My sources tell me the NoKo Summit will be held at Area 51!!!!!!! #DennisMillerOption
Anybody else missing Iran and their funny little giggle? #DennisMillerOption
On an all-new #DennisMillerOption, we've got a new sound system! Then,  @ChristianDMZ and I reminisce with  the greatest cast member in the history of @nbcsnl, @danacarvey! https://t.co/UrbU0sS2n4
Mueller just announced that if Pompeo comes back from NoKo with these three hostages he's going to subpoena them. #DennisMillerOption
Well, we've definitely lost our credibility with Iran...and yet somehow we soldier on. #DennisMillerOption
Wow! The hashtag on Trump's prescient 2013 tweet about NY AG Schneiderman reads #andthebrownstakemayfieldwiththeirfirstpick
Unmarked cash to Iran...something seems amiss...I should have realized that when I was driving into town from the train station and saw the state of disrepair the Grimaldi’s had let their roadside fruit stand fall into. #DennisMillerOption
Trump should definitely keep Mueller on and simultaneously establish an Escrow Fund for Manafort, Cohen and Flynn's pardons. #DennisMillerOption
It's gonna be an absolute bear soldiering on without Iran but somehow, someway we'll get thru it.
On an all-new episode of #RedCircleSports, @ChristianDMZ and I talk #KentuckyDerby, #NHLPlayoffs #NBAPlayoffs, #MattHarvey and more with special guest Suzy Shuster, who also discusses @richeisen, @espn and more!  https://t.co/OhyH7YXnnC

Has anyone ever seen Jorge Ramos and Marshall Applewhite in the same comet together?
I'm working on a comment on me being roasted and I'll have it for you Thursday.
Everyone knows Hillary Clinton wants back in so badly she can taste it again and again and again. If HRC was half as smart as they insist she is she would come out tomorrow and demand her fellow Liberals quit making fun of Sarah H. Sanders looks. But she won't do that, will she?
Now I know this is what the crowd at the WHCA Dinner wanted but really I would ask the ladies and gentlemen of that organization is this really worth it? Some of you certainly must realize something is amiss, right? Somebody? Anybody? Oh well...
I know this will anger a lot of folks but I really don't think Liberals have handled Hillary's loss all that well.
Am I pretty?
What a horrid human being Michelle Wolf is. I’m going to read up on her over the next couple of days and I will have a few brutally mean jokes about her by Wednesday.

I'll be appearing tonight at 7:00PM at Oxnard Levity Live in Oxnard, CA. See you there!
Check out the first episode of the #BathrobeSessions, where I discuss my favorite president from the past, and whether or not I would ever run for office. SPOILER ALERT: Don't hold your breath. https://t.co/fS4wDOwL83
What a goat schtup the Left has turned this Russia thing into. At least Trump's only accused of wetting the bed.
Just read an article on it being time to get rid of NFL Cheerleaders! Yeah! Right on Sister! And how's about a March on Lingerie! Wow! Did you ever think?
Couldn't be a bigger fan of a Herb Alpert if I wanted to be!
If cops have to have dashboard cams what about college classroom cams. Let’s see how adept the Fresno State Professor is at her craft.
I'll be appearing on the "Kennedy" show tonight on the Fox Business Network at 8:25EST!
I'd like to like Comey because outside of Hillary herself he did the most to stop Hillary but he's such a whiny drip. Nice to see the Left welcome him back though as I had worried they'd become too vindictive.
As they are tediously wont to do, there is no doubt right now a reporter comparing the heroic female Southwest Pilot's pay package to Sully's reimbursement.
I want to thank everyone who follows me especially the people who know on some level they're pretty fucked up for doing it because they hate me and shouldn't be.

I wrote a column today for https://t.co/vWtzZDJX3J if you’d like to go over and read it. Thanks for considering!
Hard to believe anyone could have an awkward interaction with Big Jim Comey. He seems so natural and authentic.
In the future you are no longer allowed to order your coffee “Black” at Starbucks but rather you must stipulate “Without Dairy.”
God, I love Hockey!
Brian Regan is the funniest stand up comedian in the world.
Let Doughty back in now. He's served more than a one game suspension. #lakings
"Our guest this evening is Siamnesia Torncurtain, the Cat Shouter." "HEY...GET OFF THAT!"
Dez Bryant was no doubt let go because Colin Kaepernick chose to kneel! It's not right I tell you! It's not right!
Before the day is over the Left will be telling you Assad is Pope John the 23rd and Trump is evil for going after him.
Is it fitting for this time in this place or just cosmically perverse that the only man in America safe from sexual harassment accusations is Bill Clinton?
I took five days off from the news. Was it because he's Russian or horny this week?
“McCabe Is Comey!” is the political E=MC2.
Comey just named the new "Bachelor!"
Team Mueller just added Dez Bryant to the squad.
If Trump willingly (and no doubt happily) steps down 1 day after the midway point of his first term, is Pence then allowed to complete Trump's term and then get 8 years of his own for a total of 10? Just asking for a friend.
Comey's been passed back and forth between the two parties more frequently than a joint at Sun Splash.
"Jim Comey is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I've ever known in my life." #raymondshaw
Comey should remember that when people look up to him it's about height and not stature.
Trump should fire Mueller this afternoon, let the Impeachment drums CrockPot up to a Bonham-esque crescendo for the next two weeks, offer Mueller his job back and when he refuses blame Mueller for being thin-skinned.
All right...I'm gonna commence to ranklin'!
I'm not sure a Democratic House in Nov. would be all that bad a thing for Trump. The R's are weak and the D's and he could then go nose to nose. They'd have to impeach or get off the pot. Let's get down to it!
I don't think of it as the Knicks firing Jeff Hornacek but rather giving him time off for good behavior. #stuckinthedolandrums
I'd have to say James Comey is the tallest little man I've ever seen! #comeyvsthecombover
I'll be appearing tonight on the "Kennedy" show on the Fox Business Network. Give it a tumble!
I think Trump should promote Mueller to Attorney General so he too could be rendered impotent.
I saw Donny Deutsch sit in with Joe Scarborough's Band on an acoustic cover of "Plynth" by the Small Faces, It was COOL! Those two are COOL!
If anyone knows Donny Deutsch, can you please introduce me? Because I always wanted to meet John Coltrane but I didn't so if I could meet Donny Deutsch I'll know I've met someone really COOL! He always gets a good table! Always! Because he's COOL!
The greatest championship tournament in the world commences! THE STANLEY CUP!!!
The only time selfless Paul Ryan isn't being summoned to "act against his own will" is when he's acting against yours.
Wonder when Paul Ryan will announce his I Didn't Ask For This Presidential Run?
Time for Paul Ryan to head back to hearth and home to do sit-ups at the family dinner table. "Dad, on the up movement, please pass the stuffing."
I think Donny Deutsch (sic) fancies himself Jean Val(blue)jean.
Obviously diamonds and silks were flagged but not opioids.
Methinks Paul Ryan is full of "aw shucks" shit.

Umm...if 9/10 of an iceberg is beneath the surface, 10/10 of a zuckerberg is.
Think of it this way. Liberals believe the WH Press Corps were as tough on Obama as they are on Trump. 'Nuff said.
Give Trump this...any other President would have had a complete nervous collapse by now. Indeed they might get him but he's going to make them bust ass to do it.

The Winklevosses haven't been this excited since they double dated the Barbie Twins.
At this point, the only guy on the internet that I trust with my personal data is that Nigerian Prince.
Trump should simply accuse Mueller of sexual harassment.
ObviouslyTrump is a Russian Agent. Sent to a Soviet Front military school in US and then from age 18 on chasing tail while becoming the quintessential capitalist billionaire. All for that moment at age 70 when Putin flipped the Red Queen and activated the Ghost in the Machine.

The absolute best thing about Hillary Clinton is that she's not a whiner!
I wonder if anyone has ever had a coronary event in the midst of mulling the phrase “All you have is the moment.”
If Trump wants to be an American Folk Hero in perpetuity he could take One Billion of his own money and start building the wall himself.
This nation "needs to have a real conversation" about incessantly "needing to have a real conversation" with each other.
In an overall sense Liberals feel like they’re slumming with Conservatives. They imagine they’re buddy breathing with mouth breathers but then again they always want Conservatives to pay for the air tanks.

Trump should hire Hillary to tamp down these sexual rumors. She’s unemployed and she knows the drill as she’s been cheated on more frequently than a blind woman playing Scrabble with Gypsies.
Just to disarm Kim Jong Un at the summit Trump should say “You remind me of Ivanka.”

Discovery Channel announces new series “Stormy Daniels Chasers.” “Get in the tater cellar, kids!” #oz#toto#victorfleming
When I hear pundits say “Stormy Daniels will bring him down” my first thought is always “Well...that’s happened already...”
https://t.co/jY9ZL0CtbS
I really don’t think I’ve ever seen human beings hate another human being as much as the Left hates Trump! Perversely fascinating! Little sick.
A lot of people will be watching Stormy Daniels tonight and perhaps even a few of them will be watching her on "60 Minutes."
I can only assume he wants out and certainly he'll get that now.
If Trump bans bump stocks as he's stated he will and the use of bump stocks was upheld in 2010 and 2012 by Obama's ATF can we acknowledge that or has Newspeak taken that firm a hold?
Can't wait till Trump strolls into Gen. Flynn's Hearing with Vincenzo Pentangeli on his arm.
It would appear Trump was colluding everything that moved.
Every time I see Ben Stein on TV discussing the current state of affairs, I expect to hear "Mueller....Mueller.....Mueller..."
What about replacing Mueller with Stormy Daniels?
My "Who's Trump Going To Fire Next" Brackets are absolutely shot.

Trump should definitely cut Mueller down to 29 hours/week. #Obamacare
I guarantee you most of the geniuses who are praying for Trump's impeachment will be shocked to find out that Pence replaces him.
I'm watching "McCabe and Mrs. Mueller" and I'll be damned if I can figure out what the hell it's about.
What's with Ahab Mueller and this Doesn't Hold Watergate investigation?
I think Hillary's drunk......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................with power.
Hillary Clinton fractured her wrist two days ago. Now that's when you know you're patting yourself on the back too hard.
As I sense a Palace coup coming against Blink 183 Pelosi, I suggest Sonic hire her as the first woman in the car on the commercials. Sitting middle back with a Slurpee Bib on asking if an order of "Tots" is "a visit from the Grandkids."
The Canonization of Rex Tillerson in the Rear View has begun but know this...calling your Boss a moron is almost never the savviest play. "Caution. Objects in Mirror Might Appear Smarter Than They Actually Are."
When you distill Hollywood's core problem down, it is this. They're always trying to appeal to people who are comped instead of people who have to pay.
Chris Cuomo getting a prime time show on the same day Stephen Hawking died might not be proof of a constantly expanding universe but certainly proof of a universe with a fucked up sense of humor.
It’s not like Gina Haspel deleted 33k waterboarding, oops...sorry...yoga videos.
The Miracle Of Changing Waterboarding Into Whine.
Hey folks...Coming to Florida in two weeks for a few gigs! March 29th the Florida Theatre in Jacksonville, 30th the Duke Energy Center, The Mahaffey Theater Saint Petersburg and the 31st at the Kravis Center for the Performing Arts  West Palm Beach. All new act...raring to go!
Quite frankly, for Trump to receive a nice welcome in California he’d have to come in illegally.
Take this any way you want to and I’ll take it the way I want to. There has never been a President like this in the history of this country.
If God forbid Pelosi is going to be Speaker of the House again shouldn't someone teach her to Speak.
Would it make everyone happy if instead of a wall Trump built a bridge...over the moat...TO the wall?
The folks in Chicago are obviously hoping President Trump pick the Border Wall with the ivy on it.
If Waterboarding is coming back I suggest instead of water they pour a Neosynephrine based nasal spray as in the end it's a drying agent and will help skirt Geneva codes.
Democrats find Gina Haspel torturous, I find Nancy Pelosi torturous.
To watch media outlets judge Trump under the old criteria, criteria that Trump has shattered into a quadrillion half-Chiclets, is beyond missing the point. It's missing the galaxy the point is located in.
Pretty soon Human Resources will be run by Robots.

Watching “Hoosiers” about the great High School hoop team from Milan, Elizabeth Warrena.
If Elizabeth Warren is so against the Death Penalty why did she croak Custer?
I’m watching “Elizabeth Warrena And The Temple Of Doom.”
Elizabeth Warren was great as "Ghandi.”
One of the greatest starting rotations ever has to be the 1954 Cleveland Indians with Bob Feller, Bob Lemon, Early Wynn and Elizabeth Warren.
I’m watching "Little Big Man” with Elizabeth Warren as Dustin Hoffman.
If Elizabeth Warren won't take a DNA test just wait for her next run and make a campaign donation of $24 in shitty beads to let her know that you know that she knows that you know.

Going to a Battle of the Bands tonight at Altamont Speedway between The Joe Scarborough Band and The https://t.co/j6G6B0xMdw Band. I'm actually hoping Sonny Barger's guys clip me before it starts.
Wow! Trump just announced the North Korea Summit will be held at Stormy Daniels apartment. Wild!
Between the Jobs #, N. Korea possibly disarming and the Steelworkers emotional testimony yesterday in the Oval Office an absolutely brutal sun cycle for Democrats. Get their shoelaces off them.
Too bad Stormy Daniels wasn't a White House intern so this could all be covered up.
Tell you one thing. When Trump and Bento Box Head do meet the entire Human Head Hair Scale will have been bookended.
Just listened to the South Korean statement on the Conservative radio station. Moment they wrapped I flipped over to the Liberal station. They were talking about Stormy Daniels. He's ending them and they don't even realize it.
Genius! Meet John Dough!

Anyone else uncomfortable when zaftig people are made to fast dance on commercials because they’ve saved money on an item or service?
The last time I trusted the FBI J. Edgar Hoover was wearing Mary Quant.
Trump's hits more buttons than John Spencer and Michael Madsen in the first five minutes of "WarGames."
Meet Comey who's lived most everywhere	From Zanzibar to Berkeley Square	But Mueller's only seen the sights 	A guy can see from Brooklyn Heights -	What a crazy pair! 		But they're cousins, 	Identical cousins all the way. 	One pair of matching bookends, 	Different as night and day.
I say this for no other reason than I believe it to be true. I don't think the Democrats have reacted very well to President Trump's election.
Watching amazing documentary on AnimalPlanet about ancient plow horse named Stosh who's been trained by his equally seasoned owner Wilkie Menlow to use his unbelievably arthritic right front hoof to tap out Mika Brzezinski's IQ on an old Crock Pot that Wilkie flipped upside down!
Already pulling my Coachella outfit together. Lotta fringe…like an aubergine shade…topped of with a stylistically discordant fez so I’m not too matchy matchy.
Jar Jar Biden says Trump is a disaster. Joe Biden should be the 3rd guy in the car on Sonic commercials. He's the Blank Square in Asshat Scrabble. He's also "I think bottled water tastes better when you shake it" stupid and shakier than a Rescue Dog in Phil Spector's house.
The reason the Oscars are so successful today is that they're infinitely more glamorous, fun and escapist than they were during the Gable, Lombard, Cary, Errol and Olivia days!
My wife Slim is so funny. She just said "The only people watching the Oscars anymore are the people at the ceremony who are taping it so they can watch it again and see themselves when they get home."
As opposed to watching the Oscars tomorrow, I'm opting to kayak solo across the Pacific with a rabid raccoon loose in the leg space of the vessel.
Turns out Deputy Scot Peterson is Uncle Rico.
Other than the time she was Secretary of State Hillary has been fighting the Reds BIGTIME since she was an embryonic paralegal at the McCarthy Hearings!!!
Hmm...watch the Oscars this weekend or go to an Oscar Mayer plant and see how they make hot dogs? I've opted for the latter.
Streisand Streisand cloned cloned her her dogs dogs..

Streisand just led local authorities to Hoffa’s grave. She’s smart!
I just read that Streisand knows for a fact that the Kremlin controls our Diebold voting machines so now I believe it.
Umm...does anyone know where there’s an 11:59PM Thursday showing of Bruce Willis in “Death Wish?”
Richard Goodstein make Loki come off like a Featured Soloist in Up With People.
Watching Jeff Sessions contemplate prosecuting legitimate crimes at such a glacial pace is akin to watching Reed Richards pass a stone.
Am I pretty?
Mika Brzezinski is more clueless than Sherlock Holmes in a crime-free world.
Just musing...would a well intentioned Liberal high school teacher who enlisted in an approved Concealed Carry Classroom program have to be painted by his fellow Liberal teachers as a gun-nut? As I'm not in the Break Room, I don't know how absolutely unyielding the protocols are.

I felt badly that I didn’t see Pelosi in the same reverential way the Democratic Party does so I just watched clips of her last 31 public statements and I apologize. I was wrong. She does seem pretty sharp and very honest. Again, sorry!
Tucker Carlson is about to clock CNN square on the button like Bob Foster did to Mike Quarry.
I know the Left sees Pelosi as a brilliant once in a generation Leader and this’ll probably trigger a shitstorm but I don’t see it. You?
I know the Left thinks Trump is Hitler but honestly...I don’t see Hitler- like behavior. You?
I'm on "Kennedy" tomorrow night!
Still waters run deep. Maxine Waters? Uhh...not so much.

Jay-Z doesn't approve of President Trump. Rod Serling chain-smoked so he wouldn't have to introduce this episode.
If the Russians altered the vote count in 3 key states in the Rust Belt and changed the Electoral College count in Trump's favor I have only one thing to say...SKOL!
I’m surprised that the Left was (is) so shocked that Hillary lost. I don’t think she was as great a candidate as they think she was. Seems like an odd Hill(ary) to die on.

Goodell just had his own ass handed to him like somebody getting outpatient lipo.
Goodell just increased penalty for jumping on a lineman's back to block a kick to 15 yds. &amp; somehow scrubbed Bruno Hauptmann's record clean.
If this Goodell/Brady decision is in any way a predictor, I see Greg Hardy as the 1st Female President of the United States.

I'm volunteering to be Trump's Press Secretary.
Never seen the country in better shape! All right...maybe a couple times.
Apologies to anyone arriving illegally right now. Wish you'd seen her in her heyday, she was a real honey! I'm not kidding! #latetoparty
Shout out to our new bestie, Iran!
Thinking of vacationing next at the stilted cottages of Sangmoon Bay.
Barbara Boxer would take the 5th if she could count that high.
Jorge Ramos is a loud trifle.
"all glory is fleeting..."
Roger Goodell is going after Tom Brady for the same reason Messala went after Judah Ben-Hur.
Some of the extras in "Patton" are staring at the camera like Uri Geller trying to bend a fucking key.
I prepared my breakfast eggs in the Eggtastic and they were so light I ended up in the jet stream in that crazy Rhys Ifans flick.
They're you go, Bubba. Right their!
Bonus coverage! Can't believe their not going to cut away to the Eggtastic Telethon thing!
Volunteers at golf tourneys who get really wired about cordoning off errant drives are weird.
I find the Nationwide Huge Baby commercial disturbing.
FCA US LLC with yet another commercial depicting the Dodge Bros. as Method and Red.
I've started a new business! I'm now pre-spattering Range Rovers with mud for wusses who are loathe to do it on their own.
People watching at mall now so disturbing you have to view the folks thru a Tom McCann box with a hole drilled in it or you risk blindness.
I've got a new gig embroidering Family Crests on CPAP masks for unapologetic, proud Old World sleep apnea sufferers.
Never have we had more means of conveying that we essentially have absolutely nothing to say to each other.
If I had to define my faith, I would say I believe someone created Charles Darwin.
If Ted Cruz wants to get the Left off his back he should simply say he's here illegally.
Boggles the mind that Paul Rogers is not in the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame. He should be in for "All Right Now" alone. #additionallybadcompany
If I'm a terrorist, Hillary is svelte.
See people wondering if Trump could "keep up" with Putin. If by "keep up" you mean present him with a toy reset button...no, probably not.
The University of Tennessee has absolutely lost it's mind. #pastthepointofnoreturn
I believe letting ball boys determine the PSI of the ball, i.e the tool you use to MAKE YOUR FUCKING LIVING!!!!!!!!! is a 5 game suspension.
I would lose all respect for Brady if he didn't know exactly how much air was in the balls. #deflategate
In closing, I do believe there is an infinitely higher court than the court of public opinion.
De-fund Planned P'hood. Let the people who aren't bothered by the videos write the checks. Hmm, what to put in the "memo" section of check?
Wow, these Planned Parenthood clips are grim. Too bad the Left doesn't view the fallopian tubes as endangered wetlands. #andiamprochoice
Just attended a Hillary rally that was held in the rubber ball that Joseph Albert Lussier used to go over over the Horseshoe Falls in 1928.

Here's tonight's O'Reilly!   http://t.co/TPyA2RSWg4
Don't look at me, I didn't vote for him.
Great article by Don Banks on the state of the NFL today on http://t.co/RFrlSU2CQS. Goodell is so shiity at his job he should be President.
When Jorge Ramos gets agitated he gets a little Separated at Birth thing going with Marshall Applewhite.
Bet Chris Carter will again be a featured instructor at next year's Rookie Symposium. CC reacting to ACTUAL video "I would never do that."
RT @SlimPaley: Can we be finished with looking for everyone's 'Spirit Animal' now?? #lame #sodumbinthefirstplace
Clemenza knocked Hillary's server over when he was taping the gun in for Michael.
It's simple. Appx. 1/2 the country thinks that Hillary is more full of it than "it" itself is full of it and 1/2 think she waddles on water.

Oh well, Tracy /Hepburn movies always cheer me up...I think tonight I'll watch State/state of the Union.
Folks, it's simply time to concede the point...today's conservative movement is Cumberland College, Obama is Georgia Tech. #Liveinsideout
...and we don't even manufacture the hand baskets anymore.

Biehnian Wisdom. Stay frosty.
I say RG3 has a bit of a comeback and the Washington Elizabeth Warrens have a chance to go 8-8 this year.
I'm seeking funding for a remake of the classic "Incredible Two Empty-Headed Transplant" with E. Warren as Milland and B. Sanders as Grier.
Elizabeth Warren "Beyond The Coiff 2" I detest people who falsely co-opt an aggrieved people's story for their own glory. And you should too
I've been asked to go after Elizabeth Warren on more substantive grounds that her horrible coiff. Ok, I find super rich Socialists tedious.
Elizabeth Warren (Code Name:Dances With Donors) is so rich she should spring for a haircut that doesn't look like Miguel Indurain's helmet.
Just watched "The Kingsmen" on the plane...truly fab!
Dick Van Patten seemed like a good man...RIP.
Heh, heh, heh. "Sustainable, environmentally responsible golf." Enjoy everybody!
Think Jordan Spieth gets a Denny's breakfast commercial if he wins this week?
Howzabout I'm not up for "whatever"...
I kid David Bauer. He actually seems to have a pretty good sense of humor.
David Bauer is the Tigris and Euphrates of Missing the Point.
Nothing speaks more eloguently to the death of meritocracy than social media pointing out words you deliberately misspelled for a joke.
Nothing speaks more elequantly to the death of meritocracy than the shitty spelling of the people hired to be TV Closed Captioning typists.
I think Buck, Norman, Weiskopf and Faxon are doing a really nice job first time out of the blocks.
Political Correctness has actually bled over and ruined the word Correct for me.
Looks like Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed will be playing in a vacuum as everybody follows Joost Luiten and Tony Finau.
The Prez does more fundraisers than a PBS CFO with a hidden blow problem.
If you're taking Cialis for Daily Use, do you have to take one on February 29th of a Leap Year? I'm asking for an impotent friend.
My favorite character on "Swamp Thing Adams Family" was Uncle Fescue.
If the Pope is hot he ought to ditch the "Miserando Atque Eligendo" Parka during the summer months.
Hitchcock took a few Macguffin Mulligans in "The Trouble 	With Harry."
Do golf crowds somehow believe that they are part of the actual endeavor?
The Pope oughta just stick to the "Hell is hot" thing.
The last time I saw someone as scrambled and mixed up as Rachel Dolezal, Mr. Scott was reporting a Transporter Malfunction to the bridge.
Sorry, two tweets ago I misspelled Rachel Dolezal's name but if she doesn't know who the fuck she is how am I supposed to know?
If Rachel Dolezal now just marries an Isis Fighter with Ebola in Ferguson I've got Yahtzee!
I think the official diagnosis on Rachel Dolezal is Thelonious Monkhausen by Proxy Syndrome.
These are the times that try men's souls but fail to test their mettle.
Tear up your Peechee folders because basic multiplication is next to go.
Modern life has turned into one long, meandering answer to an essay question that used to be a yes or no question. Thanks educators!
I just watched the interview and my takeaway is Matt Lauer's full head of hair.
I know we're only at the midway point but I'd have to guess that Rachel Dolezal is now the clear front runner for Time's Person of the Year.
Folks, it's now officially reached the point where all the train wrecks slow down to ogle us.
So happy for Andre Iggy!
Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Monroe, Raquel Welch...Joyce Mitchell. #what thefuckhappenedtoshawshank?
Congrats Warriors!
You're kidding me.

Congrats to the Blackhawks!
You understand...right?
Dellavadova has announced he's quitting his insulin and also his dialysis immediately prior to Game 5.
I saw Joey Crawford's head sticking out of a girl's purse at Coachella this year.
Excited that Adam Silver and Joey Crawford are starring in the "Ten-Speed and Brown Shoe" remake.
Joey Crawford makes the Golum look like Paul Newman in Hud.

Joey Crawford is a shit ref.
I'll tell you one thing for sure, the Thought Police aren't relegated to 29 Hour work weeks.

Iran's nuclear facility is highly reminiscent of Crab Key circa 1963.
So prescient I'm going to post it again. http://t.co/LzYmHTw8et
Some of these declarations that this is one of the greatest stories ever in the NBA are some of the greatest greatest declarations ever!
Danny Crawford is guessing like Kreskin with a migraine.
Vilavanova!
Nothing better than having people who hate you yet follow you pretend to unfollow you!
Whatever Dellavadova is, JR Smith is the opposite.
David Blatt looks like Frank Fontaine playing Julius Caesar.
Shaun Livingston makes Tayshaun Prince look like Serge Nubret.
Dell's kid can't hang with Delly! Kidding...just kidding.
Bron is getting hit like Mike Quarry in the Foster Fight.
Cleveland gets any more dinged up they're gonna have to bring Mouse McFadden in.
Shaq is like Willy Loman if he'd attended Pete Newell's Big Man Camp.
Doris Burke is an absolute pro!
"...Like a champagne Dellavadova in the sky..."
Rascal Flats equals 3 Barney Rubbles with pomade.
Nice of D-Wade to leave the Prom.

You want to boil it all down? It comes to this. Appx. 52% of the country thinks Juan Williams is a genius and George Will is an idiot. #doa
All of the Iranian nuclear facility workers wearing surgical masks remind me of Cpl. Klinger assisting in triage.
You know when I knew Obama was still smoking? When he said he quit smoking.
Frank Overton kills it in "Fail-Safe" and "To Kill A Mockingbird." Impeccable acting!

Duck and cover, folks.
If I could have super power it would be to know what everyone makes exactly. Then I would use my knowledge of their earnings to subdue them.
I don’t like commercials where they make people fast dance because they’ve saved money on an item.
Personal credo? I feel that if you can make a difference in just one person's life...well, that's really not enough, is it?
My hidden talents? I believe I have the ability to read the minds of shallow, transparent, painfully obvious people.
Fouling out is the most constructive thing JR Smith has done all night.
25 should never ref again.
The first six chapters of Don DeLilo's "White Noise" auger for what could be the funniest book I've read since "A Confederacy of Dunces."
"Mackenna's Gold" is a fun movie.
Who's more oppressive? Jimmy Cagney in "Love Me Or Leave Me" or Broderick Crawford in "Born Yesterday"?
Is it bad when somebody comes out of the bathroom like Rod Taylor comes into Dining Room at the start of "Time Machine?" Asking for a friend
It would appear that modern life is just the down time between apologies.
Just finished reading "Stoner"...beautiful book...devastating.
Go Cavs!
Pelosi's face has just been sued by the V for Vendetta mask for copyright infringement.

Despite what you hear, the TSA is on top of it. Disregard Carlos the Jackal going thru on a Slip n' Slide while Verne Troyer's on the Rack.
Wow! This just in! "Sepp Blatter Replaces Josh Earnest"!
Sepp Blatter just fell off the step ladder.
Between Bernie Sanders' published sexual fantasies and his ideology, to elect him would mean "50 Shades Of In The Red" for the country.
In the name of sharing, give your votes to Bernie Sanders opponent.
Colt Knost is Joey Crawford's inner child.
You might as well have started Emilio Estevez between the pipes for the Ducks tonight.
Should I watch "Lee Daniels' Casablanca" tonight or "Lee Daniels' The Maltese Falcon"?
Just saw a trailer for the new "Terminator" film. Evidently in this one Arnold battles a housekeeper from the future.
I'm working on a nice Leonard Peltier/Mumia Abu Jamal teaser bet for the "Obama's Final Day Presidential Pardon Propositions" Big Board!
We want Israel to return to their '67 borders? Hey, hows about WE return to our '67 borders.

Say this about the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council, he would always lay his cloaking device across a puddle for a lady.
Waterboarding is not a double-edged sword. A double-edged sword like the double-edged sword Isis uses is a double-edged sword.
I’ve been trying to meld my spur of the moment nature with my love of history into a series of Pop Up Ancient Ruins.
Isn’t it ironic that McCauley Caulkin now looks like the kind of guy you’d be afraid would break into your house while you were out of town.
My college roommate Eddie Sikorsky had Helicopter Parents.
My MD told me I had a strained oblique muscle and then added that he couldn’t quite be sure where it was.
It’s official. Names now hurt us more than sticks and stones.
Quirkily enough, in a previous life I believe I was someone who wasn’t completely sold on Buddhism.
Allure of I-Phones. People who are ordinarily thought to be idiots are brilliant on them and people who are geniuses are helpless on them.

The Ducks just played as solid a period as I've seen in the playoffs.
Joey Crawford doing the mud slide at Woodstock!
Rough night. I slept like Gregor Samsa with a broken antenna.
Headline...'I created a monster': Art Garfunkel on Paul Simon...The problem was, Art, that Paul was creating absolutely everything else.
Had brunch with some friends three weeks ago and now everybody remembers it differently...noshomon.
Get a feeling the only carbon based emission that won't trouble greens is the one given off when they eventually burn deniers at the stake?
Paul Simon is a true genius and Art Garfunkel is a true garfunkel. #bridgeovertroubledwhiner
I don't want to say it's been a tentative start but my mother in law is leading.
Why is it that when I watch Olivier's "Hamlet" I'm always tempted to say "Speak English!"

Shumpert is a kid and play-ah!
Was going to make a "Henrik is playing like Verne" but I can't because he's too good, too classy and I'm an asshole for even thinking it.
STAMKOS!
Bron just disparaged Bazemore like Dracule disparaged Renfield.
The Trivago Guy comes off like Bill Holden when you compare him to this kid on the McDonalds commercials.
Obama just gave a commencement speech at American Climate Institute and oddly focused on the 220' Seagoing Buoy Tender Grappling Mechanism.
The Clintons are like the Hotel California in that no one ever leaves them.
"Winning: The Racing Life of Paul Newman" is a brilliant documentary! Congrats to Carolla and team for hole-shotting it! #adamcarolla

Letterman"s last shot should be him in lotus position, eyes closed, slight smile as Bill Murray's character "Nick Finale" sings Coke Song.
The Clinton Global Initiative has replaced Spectre in the new Bond film. Daniel Craig grapples with Hillary's character, "Nojob" at the end!
The Clinton Foundation has more shaky donors than a blood bank adjacent to a bus terminal.
Mama June and Honey Boo Boo appear to have a lot on their paper plates.
Mr. Masters take on Mr. Finch in the novel "Stoner" is the most brilliant encapsulation of perpetual academicians ever penned.

Ricky Nelson is really great in "Rio Bravo"!
I think Roger Goodell is certainly A Man For This Season and should be the next President of the United States.

I just walked in on my Roomba trying to unionize my other household appliances.

Ken Hitchcock makes a delightful cameo appearance in each NHL team. #stephanopoulosusingthistweetasamacguffin
You wanna know what'll happen? Stephanopoulos will also replace Williams and now host two nightly network newscasts. #shrugging
I wish that Audrey Hepburn would come back and vanquish the Kardashians.
Core tenet of social media. It’s not about what happens anymore, it’s about what happens after what happens happens. #secondguessingexperts
The main problem in America right now is that the Federal Government has “Fuck You Money.”

Bingo Smith is first man up tonight!
MSNBC having a harder time with ratings than a Moody's analyst with an undiagnosed brain tumor.
50K donation by Stephanopoulos affords D's a perfect opportunity to deem R's paranoid when they protest the debate he'll no doubt moderate.
Stephanopoulos didn't work this hard for the Clintons when he worked for the Clintons.

You know why the Brady thing doesn't bother me? Let's face facts, the whole fucking culture is deflated.
Brady shouldn't sweat the schadenfreude brigade, it's all pervasive these days. People now celebrate the fall of those who've never risen.
Too bad for TB that Goodell has so fucked his own rep in the last couple of years that Brady has to be flattened. #tonyslydinidiversion

In addition to the obvious, Michael Moor (sorry, he ate the "e" before I could type it) is also morbidly obtuse.
As unbelievable as it may seem, Michael Moore's weight indicates that he loathes himself more than he loathes his enemies.
In a battle of wits with S.E.Cupp, Michael Moore is unarmed.

Here's my appearance on O'Reilly, discussing the many controversies the White House has been battling recently https://t.co/AdxKTsJ6Jv
IRS chief Miller steps down...replaces Holder at DOJ...Holder...steps in for Hillary at State...Hillary now...Press Secretary. Carney TBD.
Usually a twelve minute wait for a two minute performance shows up in an EDD ad, not the White House.
Obama just scheduled an AM haiku with the Press Corps at 9 EST.
Can audit by drone be far behind?
UPI must be living in a bad time share with Roebuck and Andrew Ridgeley.
Brevity is the soul of cover-up.
At the very least, can the White House erect their coming stonewall on our southern border?
Discussing how the left wing media is beginning to flip on @BarackObama, @PodcastOne http://t.co/RX10d84XSh
Things got so bad at the White House today, just to be sure, they had to break out the Renfield manacles and clamp Biden to the wall. #Biden
I'm thinking of following @KWJuett and you should too. He says "I'd rather play golf than twitter." Yeah, it's that fun!
@KWJuett Do I make the autographed photo out to KW or KWJ?
@KWJuett follows me so closely I sometimes worry he's a stalker!
Also, to any conservative group out there that has been thinking about fudging their taxes? You might want to buy on the dips, as they say.
It would appear Obama is the "most out of the loop/center of it all" guy in the history of the universe.
Jay Carney has a worse bluff than Marty Feldman with pocket aces.
Very APropos that they monitored the AP as I believe that stands for "Ass Pucker-upper."
I just got my wazoo Armor-alled because I'm no doubt being audited out of it as I type this.
Hey Greyhound mechanics, get a 42 Reg jumpsuit together for Carney because he's about to join you...
Uh-oh...Obama just asked the family dog Bo to legally change his name to Checkers.
Carney blows more smoke than a Rastafarian's death rattle.
"This is the day the oceans stopped rising..." Yeah, because bullshit is less dense than ice.
By the way AP, don't accuse this administration of Big Brother tactics or you'll be accused of racism.
I'm beginning to think that Jaromir Jagr is Benjamin Button with sturdier pins.
Is it just me, or does anyone else see a vague outline of Sergio Garcia playing another shot under the Boston ice?
Leafs-Bruins is chippier than the last half hour of "Fargo."
Glenn Beck just got gang-audited.
Soledad Obrien sees every aspect of life as shot thru the prism of black and white except of course the primal battle between good and evil.
The whistle on Soledad Obrien's train of thought is barely audible off in the distance. "Something Insipid This Way Comes."
If this Administration were any more full of it, they'd be in violation of California's new foie gras ban.
Jay Carney is shakier than a jackhammer operator playing Jenga on his lunch break. #bullshitters
re AP phone records story. Perfect symbiosis between Prez and mainstream media. They're ass kissers and Obama's telling them to kiss his ass

In photos I see, I believe the winner of the Venezuelan election is wearing the same outfit Ricky Fowler wore on Friday at the Masters.
Seamillercrest out!
Leishman's obviously the fan favorite, right?
Snedeker resembles a man introduced to the concept of color late yesterday.
Cabrera has made less eagles than a guy who copulates with national symbols.
That guy looked like Lloyd Bucher reading a statement against his will as penned by his N. Korean captors.
Just another langerous Sunday watching golf.
A couple feet from possibly being good is Mosul.
Somebody get hold of Feherty.
Tiger...alarming.
There are people on a Tussin drip not as relaxed as Freddie.
Does Ricky Fowler have a clothing deal with Prison Road Crew Togs Inc.?
His guardian cabrera is definitely watching over him.
Adam Scott hits more layups than Siva for Lou'ville.
Snedeker is like Donny Most with nerves.
Day out of the sand like T.E. Laurence at Akaba!
Snedeker lands it in the bowl more than "The Last Emperor."
Cabrera in the trees more than Weyerhauser.
Langer still ripped! No battle of the bulge whatsoever!
Brant Snedeker is the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates of tousled.
@readygolfer Remember when Dave Marr won the French Open in '68 by laying up on 17 and birdied after a stiff chip? Headlines "Heady L'Marr"
Let's see is Langer can get into the Sudentenla-...oops, sorry....clubhouse early with a good score.
Matt Kuchar may not win the green jacket but he maintains his perennial postion atop the Double Entendre Nickname heap.
Jim Nantz...the Dog-leg Whisperer. #masters
Billy Payne can heal.
Jim Nantz whispers more than Roy Cohn.
Is Faldo morphing into Rene Zellweger?
re CBS opening montage. Has the Masters become too meaningful to actually play it? Is Nantz performing Extreme Unction or announcing golf?
The poignant Masters theme seems just a little more melancholy today. We've all lost here.
I wish the 4th Estate had been this curious about Benghazi.
Nantz, still flinching from Costas excoriation, is now Oriana Fallaci.
Nantz just established that indeed Tiger had been "reached out to." Alert the Pulitzer people.
Hopefully in the future one half of us we'll all be able to vaguely detest the other half of us from afar well into our 100's.
And Rolfing is prohibited from this point on!
By the way, don't worry about Obamacare. Libs will eventually do it in when they realize participation will involve Photo ID.
...and for good measure, the word "gulf" must never be used again.
Golf must never be played again.
Everyone (and I mean all of us) should win the Masters except the player who actually wins it! It's only fair!!! And fair is good!
And when you freeze an ice rink over for curling, doesn't the freon mix into the atmosphere and...and...and...
I wish the 4th Estate had been this curious about Benghazi. #tigeratmasters
Jodie Arias now your on the course leader at Augusta.
Obvious what has to happen. Never play the Masters again and cancel NFL until we can be assured no one will ever be injured! America 180!
To think the Masters has turned into the Warren Commission over a couch potato in his undies bitching about a foot and a half is hilarious.
All the usual suspect rich guys getting fat and happy in the stock market. Obama is cruel and heartless to not care about the little guy.
I think Obama's prime directive is to replace fossil fuels with envy.

Obama might have Palin by 5 to 7 IQ points but she's got him common sense- wise by light years.

Hope the new Pope works as hard off the ball as Manu Ginobli.

Veterans Committee just names Aeneas Williams new pope.

Anquan Boldin for a sixth? to the Niners? Somebody help me with this one.

Healthcare Dr.ones?
Drano Drones? Drone-o?
Q-Tip Drones?
Any truth to the rumor that if your holding a jar of Prego Marinara sauce and it turns blue you're knocked up?
Catheter drones?
Obama administration pondering a per/step surcharge on travel by Acorn Stair Lift.
Think Obama's Medicare Advantage cuts are "bad medicine" for seniors? Join my friends at AMAC @MatureAmericans - http://t.co/ASmEyYp1Ow
Colonoscopy drones?
The College of Cardinals is like the Green Lantern Corps with better expense accounts.

Here's my appearance on O'Reilly, discussing sequester scare tactics and Dennis Rodman in North Korea https://t.co/9GUGHYV1aI
With Chavez dying before Castro my brackets are already screwed.
I'm thinking Bobby Valentine for new Prez in Venezuela?
Just watched the O'Reilly-Colmes contretemps in it's entirety. Monica Crowley looked like Sandy Dennis in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"
Chavez's replacement appears to be the next Sasha Baron Cohen film.
When a porcine entity like Chavez enters into Hieronymus Bosch-ville the locals think of it as a karma luau.
Fenway's Citgo sign at half-mast.
Chavez has an All-Access laminate from Dante.
I haven't seen an American played like Rodman was in 2013 N.Korea since Jimmy Carter in 1994 N. Korea and Carter couldn't hit the o-glass.
Kevin Spacey is a genius. #houseofcards

Judging by their clumsy, invasive questions at the Combine, it would  appear NFL scouts believe Manti Te'o might have an imaginary boyfriend
Fuck Psy and the imaginary horse he rode in on.
My gut tells me that what we're seeing right now is the awkward birth of a third party.
Can Hollywood take a night off from the Obamas now? In a single generation they've gone from "fight the power" to "invite the power."

Did I hear today on the news that "Sea Quest" is coming back on the air in nine days on March 1st? #sequestration
I find myself in a Kafka novella trying repeatedly (and unsuccessfully) to delete a Kafka e-book from my Ipad.
I didn't think it was possible but Harry Belafonte is actually a denser individual than he was a shitty actor...a true Renaissance man.
Officer O'Reilly and I are coming to Phoenix, Los Angeles, Atlantic City, Washington DC, and Westbury, NY! http://t.co/y5YK5o3M
@DougAndTRae Indeed I do!
Here's my appearance on O'Reilly, discussing Obama's State of the Union address and the Pope's resignation http://t.co/XYgiVjbj
I passed on the State of the Union...I wanted to watch actual lapdogs so I flipped it over to the Westminster Kennel Show.
Biden's stare at the SOTU was blanker than the check Obama expects the American people to write him. #SOTU
Dr. Ben Carson...speaking truth to ineptitude.
Is this Arias Trial in fact just a three episode arc on "Portlandia?"
In a reverse Django, Obama orders Lindsay Graham and John Thune to fight to the death at tonight's SOTU. #SOTU
Hillary to replace Benedict? #pope
If the Prez were anymore full of it concerning Drones vs Waterboarding, he would be protected under CA.'s new foie gras abolition ruling.
Can we all come together as a nation and agree to only kill people by drone while they're being water boarded? #onenationundergod

This country is operating more in the red than the kid's face in the Bar Rafaeli Super Bowl ad.
Headline Today. "Women's Unclean Breasts Cause Diarrhoea, Says Egypt Prime Minister Hisham Qandil" This is what passes for E=MC2 over there.
Most telling thing about Obama's attention to detail is that he'll have to have his "Enemies List" revealed to him on prompter.
Working on a biz model for private air travel on unmanned drones being deadheaded into staging areas above major American cities. Bonanza!
Best thing about Super Bowl is that even the NFL hierarchy realizes they in no way shape or form can call the game like the regular season.
Just opening up a line of conversation. Would all female military units be good for esprit d'corps purposes?
If it'll help Libs to sleep at night, we can waterboard with neo-synephrine so the end result will be drying up terrorist's nasal passages.
Good for you Leon Panetta to exhibit some balls in a Ken doll world.
I just had an idea for app that allows you to record a dogs bark and it'll tell you what breed it is. Perhaps we could call it Soundhound?
