I’m not even done. 		A democratic congresswoman using a RACIAL SLUR to describe black conservatives is NOT OKAY. 		How dare you?!!! Referring to blacks as coons, tokens, or house negroes is a RACIAL SLUR. 		You are absolute filth for this @AOC https://t.co/JhkTTJyvWl
The audacity of you to accuse a black man of tokenism. 		Have you lost your mind? 		You are a puppet for the party of the KKK, slavery, and Jim Crowe. 		Don’t you dare try to step to an educated black man and insult him for not being as radically stupid as you. https://t.co/JhkTTJyvWl
@AnthonyNMorgan Lol this is so dumb. I said “I’ve never been a slave”. The only part in quotations, if you noticed. The other part is the Daily Beast treating you like a dummy who can’t read proper English. #FakeNews		I never said the “racism is over because” portion.

The entire concept of “Trump’s America” is a hoax on minorities being executed by the Left. 		It’s wealthy Democrats attempting to regain power by using blacks and our historical fear of racism. 		It’s important that all minorities raise their emotional IQ, or risk being used.
Who would have thought Nigeria was MAGA country? 		Trump really does have a magic wand.

Last night, Trump won 2020 and exposed Democrats for what they are;		They celebrate the killing of 9 month old babies but cannot be happy for minorities who are being lifted out of poverty. 		Wearing white made them look like teenager activists in the presence of greatness.
They won’t applaud 5 million people lifted off of food stamps. 	They won’t applaud historically low black unemployment. 	They won’t applaud historically low Hispanic unemployment. 		Democrats need minorities to need them. 		But Trump has awakened us to the American Dream!		#SOTU

Internalized Misogyny	Toxic Masculinity	White Privilege		These are all terms created by people who cannot win a debate based on the merit of their ideas, and so attempt to shame people against challenging their flawed logic.		This strategy has worked on me exactly 0 times.
@LizzieRovsek There are so many special labels and definitions created by “feminist” women who are ultimately miserable. 	The Lena Dunham type 3rd wave feminism is toxic and seeks to shame women who don’t participate in their hateful, divisive, man-hating worldview.
@espiers While I’m sure you’re 1/1024th Latino— by your definition, wouldn’t an example of sexism and  internalized misogyny be you attacking me because I dare to think for myself? 		Or does it only apply to conservative women that critique liberals? 		You are all full of shit.
Actually, internalized misogyny is a made-up term by radicalized white suburban feminists who think they can control outspoken women plus garner more power for themselves by creating imaginary diagnoses. 		Sorry, Lizzie. I’m impervious to pussy-hat horse shit. https://t.co/QlISfi1oI0
Factuality and morality are not mutually exclusive concepts, @AOC.

Fact: Texas has shut down 8 prisons in just 6 yrs by implementing policies presented in the #FirstStepAct.		And South Carolina has shut down 7.		They don’t have enough criminals to fill up the prisons!		If passed, this bill will be a major bi-partisan win for @realDonaldTrump.

@CoreysDigs I will delete the tweets out of respect for the people that follow me, but let it be known that @TomiLahren was dropped from Turning Point— not the other way around.
@Phoenix4972 You have always known me snap at liars. I literally have no tolerance for them. Typically the lies come from journalists on the Left. Tomi might be on the right, but a liar is a liar.
TLDR: Tomi has been suffering a year long aftershock that Charlie had the audacity to walk away from her furious diva, only-child syndrome demands. Now she is pretending she walked away because of some virtuous “leadership” issues. 		No. We rejected her nasty behavior.
@ali @TomiLahren Her text messages would not have been received well by any side. She did apologize, but only bc I flat out caught her and sent her an email about them.
@GaltRush @crowder_ron She is not going to lie and pretend she “opted out” of turning point because she is embarrassed regarding what SHE did to me. Doesn’t work that way.
@jmpayne7 @TomiLahren @FoxNews I’m offering her an opportunity to prove she has the depth to debate a policy that she has referred to as “Trash”. I think we’d all love to see that side of her. Offer still stands!
@Acore403 @TomiLahren @FoxNews This would be the point. Tomi thinks the bill is “trash”. Why not be open to explaining why so people can form their own opinions. Assuming she is researched and well-reasoned.
@wireddesigns1 @TomiLahren @FoxNews I’m not fighting her, I’m respectfully challenging her to an intellectual debate. She holds a lot of viewpoints that many people are curious about but that she refuses to expand upon long form. Calling everyone a snowflake and then backing down from a debate is rich in irony.
@TomiLahren @FoxNews Would you prefer to debate @BernardKerik at #SAS? What about @conservmillen on your abortion stance? Or do you have an excuse as to why you can’t debate either of them as well, @TomiLahren ?
@TomiLahren @FoxNews This is a nice try to play the victim, Tomi— but I called you a vile human being for the nasty things you texted about me before I ever even knew you. 	I called you intellectually bankrupt bc you shout opinions and refuse to debate them long form— like you’re doing now.

@Jealoebill20232 Thank you but I’ve never lived in Africa my entire life. I’m American. I also happen to be black. Two facts. White people don’t refer to themselves as euro-American. We are all just Americans— with different complexions.
I haven’t cared, not even one solitary moment, about the illegals at the border. 		But I’ll make a deal: 		If I see black America receive even one fraction of the attention and faux-outrage that this caravan of migrants has commanded, I‘ll reconsider my position. 		#AmericaFirst

@EkaA02493443 We began accepting Jewish refugees when their government began ransacking property and personal belongings from them plus sanctioning discrimination and violence against them. 	They came to America— LEGALLY. 		THERE IS NO SUCH THING HAPPENING IN SOUTH AMERICA.
@Libraryghost No, sicko. There is no government in South America that has mandated the slaughter of its citizens. Also, Mexico offered the Honduran caravan refuge. They are refusing because they want to come to America, instead. Real refugees don’t have demands.
@NikkiMsB The left has made a mockery of the Jewish genocide. How any Jewish person still votes Democrat is beyond me.
Imagine comparing the slaughter of 6 million Jews, plus the mandated murders of 1 million Rwandans— to immigrants who just want an upgrade and don’t want to follow any rules to get it.

How many black “leaders” have spent the last two plus years speaking out about unfair sentencing for our men— and yet are DEAD SILENT on the prison reform that @realDonaldTrump just got done for millions? 		You are all false prophets and idols. Zero respect for any of you fakes.
The majority of rappers and ballers are fake thugs and cowards. 		How many of them used the hashtag #FreeMeek but have remained silent over the President signing off on historic prison reform? 		They don’t want the problems in our community fixed. 	They profit from our ignorance.
Under no circumstances can a Democrat win a debate about public policy, so instead— they make a plea to public emotion by baselessly referring to their opponents as racists. 		Ultimately, it’s a plea targeted to constituents that they believe are too stupid to understand policy.
If you’ve not yet been wrongly referred to as racist, sexist, misogynist, alt-right or a conspiracy theorist— you are not yet conscious of the cultural war at hand.		Although once meaningful, these labels are now only used to distract people from further pursuing truth.

@betabeta_16 @kathygriffin I’ve actually “chilled” for a year straight by not releasing nasty messages she sent about me that would have ended her non-career long ago. 	Today I’m not in the chilling mood so unless she wants to get burned, she will stop subbing me immediately.
Tomi,		I think I can speak on behalf of people on both sides of the political aisle and say we are sorry about your failed career.

Like “oh this is what this person thought politically when he/she died” or “this is who this person liked or disliked when he/she died” is not an argument. 		I still support @realDonaldTrump. 		Sorry, it needed to be said.
This new trend of using funerals and eulogies to deliver political messages is really quite disgusting. 		Sympathy from death as means to sway public opinion is next level corrupt. 		Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves.

Indeed, Saul Alinsky’s “Rules for Radicals” is the handbook for Democrat Party. 	One of the rules is to accuse the other side of what you are doing. 		@ChristopherHahn is accusing ME of colluding with racist ANTIFA because his party is the one that does it.
This is such a perfect example of the Democrat party today for all to see. @ChristopherHahn is actively spinning a conspiracy theory for a TERRORIST organization, rather than defending conservative Americans and/or the @PhillyPolice force. 		The Democrats are indeed INSANE. https://t.co/JJqGPRDJHc
You’re a real SICKO. No one followed anyone in. We were sat FIRST. They were sat AFTER us. Feel free to CALL THE RESTAURANT TO CONFIRM.		You are GIVING VIOLENCE AND RACISM AN EXCUSE. Why?		Because you are a Democrat, and you ARE the party of violence and racism. https://t.co/JJqGPRDJHc
Want more proof that ANTIFA was in fact eating at the restaurant with us before they sent out a bat signal to their local gang members? CALL THE RESTAURANT. DO YOUR JOB, “JOURNALISTS”.		We thought Russia collusion was a batty as you guys could get. ANTIFA collusion is next level.
ANTIFA took FULL credit for what they did on their twitter page @ChristopherHahn. They also said they were inspired by an @HuffPost smear article, labeling our organization as racist.		This proves @realDonaldTrump’s point: the #FAKENEWS media IS the enemy of the American people.
.@ChristopherHahn should be ashamed of himself for insinuating we coordinated WITH ANTIFA to harass us. 	For the record, 4 of them were eating at the same restaurant as us. They said nothing and TEXTED their gang members to show up. Once they had back up, they started shouting. https://t.co/67tY32Oep6

Nope! Shocking, since @jaketapper will literally report on my tweets from 8 months ago and their network spent all of last week claiming they were fearful because @Acosta was told he sucked at a Trump rally. 		Suspiciously silent when violent mobs attack conservatives. https://t.co/XrTWzjKKOs

Yes. When over 90% of a community is voting for one political party, they become irrelevant. Our voting predictability made it so that neither side needed to make good on promises to our community. 		This is all about to shift, dramatically. https://t.co/YX9933QO6c
I’m calling it now, the black community, which has been politically irrelevant for decades, will become the most politically relevant voting group by 2020. 		The greatest untapped resource in America is the black community. 		Our awakening is finally happening.

I’m completely impervious to mob-mentality. 		The truth is not a democracy. The #metoo movement has been a overwhelmingly negative for both women and men.
Hey Tara, would love to introduce you to some of the female survivors of rape who think the #metoo movement has cheapened their assaults. 	They are terrified to say so publicly bc of people like you who think there is something proprietary about the victim narrative. https://t.co/zMm9E7coOA
Biggest problem with the #metoo movement is that it turned sexual assault into a trend and simultaneously drowned out the voices of real rape victims— who deserve to be heard. 		I will speak about all of this at #YWLS2018 in a few days. 		It’s time for real women empowerment.
The entire premise of #metoo is that women are stupid, weak &amp; inconsequential. 	Too stupid to know what men might want if you come to their hotel room late at night. 	Too weak to turn around and tell someone not to touch your ass again.	Too inconsequential to realize this.
Modern feminism is so toxic. It is singlehandedly deteriorating relationships and eventual motherhood. 		I will always speak out against what has become a rabid cult of misery. 		If you believe in equality between men and women, you cannot be a feminist today.

To think that your ability to dribble a ball, throw a football, and/or decline a White House invitation makes you more a hero than the bodies that are sent home in coffins laid under OUR American Flag is why DONALD TRUMP WON! 		I’ve had enough of these overprivileged athletes!
You have to be a fundamentally daft human being if you believe that America will stand w/ football and basketball players, above the American troops and veterans who DIE fighting for our freedom. 		@KingJames nobody gives a damn what you think about our President. 		AMERICA FIRST
People always ask me about my very early appearance on @PrisonPlanet’s channel. 	They either want me to apologize, or try paint me as a conspiracy theorist. 		It’s not a conspiracy. I simply really like Paul Joseph Watson. https://t.co/5Zh1qIj7Hu
I never got into this to be a politician—I simply wanted to inspire others. But the recent onslaught of establishment types trying to paint me as a dumb girl that landed where I am by chance, has me rethinking my position. 	No one’s ever bet against what I can accomplish and won.
This is the greatest President of our lifetime. 	As a matter of fact, not opinion. 		The honor was truly mine, @realDonaldTrump.  	#MAGA #KeepAmericaGreat https://t.co/QEAhUndL2c
You deserve it. 	The mob can longer dictate who we are allowed to love. 	We are free. https://t.co/0gTAXHzrms
When NBC tweeted out that Oprah was their next president is another moment. 		#TheDayJournalismDied https://t.co/YtjcEEbevc
What was the moment you first realized that journalism was dead?  		“Did he use a condom?” -@andersoncooper to Stormi Daniels. 		I had long since suspected it had been dying, but that to me represented a flat line.
I don’t see myself as a victim. 	Why has that become a position of controversy to the left?

Truly sorry @VanJones68! I’ve never had to cancel a show, ever. I would welcome the opportunity to be invited back. And would like to extend my apologies to the many fans of your show who were looking forward to my appearance.
I would like to apologize to @VanJones68 and his entire team @CNN. I had to cancel my appearance on his show last minute bc the landing gear on my scheduled plane malfunctioned. Truly a freak circumstance that had a negative ripple effect.
RT @JudgeJeanine: @RealCandaceO joined me on ‘Justice’ to discuss some of the most outrageous comments of the week. Enjoy! https://t.co/p4N…
Coming up now with @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews. Discussing the outrageous headline of the week, plus the twisted world of journalism today. Tune in!!
Let me clarify. A journalist lives for the idea that if they print something salacious and hurtful enough, a public figure and/or celebrity will mention their name in anger &amp; hurt. 	We should STOP using their names for that reason. (Not all journalists are sadistic—but many are). https://t.co/988Ke8QUjj
In my earlier periscope, I spoke about the illness that ravaged my life and left me bed-ridden for six months in late 2016. I thank God for making me sick. It forever humbled me. Here are a few pics, as promised.	They represent my biggest insecurity. Feels good to release it. https://t.co/FbMwYVsC6v
Journalist hitmen are no different than school shooters. They do it so that you’ll mention their names. 	They literally live for it. Never give them the publicity. https://t.co/Hs2pqD6uVV
I’m so old, I remember when @TomArnold told me to “suck a r****t d*ck” a few weeks ago. 		Great to see he has since become an @CNN expert on tweeting obscenities to black women. https://t.co/CqyIrt3pGX
Two questions. Do you think using a racial slur against me is okay because you’re black? 	And are we supposed to believe you’re a man of God because you stuck a “Bishop” before your name? 		Can’t wait for all the great liberal defenders against racism to come to my side!! https://t.co/hsIP9Fff8X
“And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free” https://t.co/9uSg4aFu7t
Live Periscope in 1 hour, 3pmET to mic drop every skeleton in my family closet. 	This will be the most empowering thing I’ve ever done.
Because I actually believe in what we are doing. Charlie never puts me in a box. He genuinely believes in me and trusts my gut. 	There actually is such a thing as priceless. He is my loyal partner and friend and we are just getting started. There are other ways we can make money. https://t.co/IDrW0DIL4y
1) I signed on the dotted line to work for @TPUSA for 50k, annually. I do not get paid by Fox News, and have never been paid to speak on a college campuses. 	I recently turned down a million dollar contract to stay with Turning Point USA. It was very hard to do that. Lol https://t.co/lsMdWtcLyB
If there are any journalists who would like to ask meaningful questions, now is the time. 	I am a shockingly honest person, and have only held back on things that would incidentally affect my family. I now have my family’s full blessing.
I struggled with Anorexia from the time I was 18-21 years old.  It was a response to some childhood traumas, and a means to assert control over my life.
...that particular cousin grew up without a father (he was in prison). Her mom used to kick her out all the time too and she’d come live with us. It was important to me that Charlie met her. 		My family members are my muses. There is beauty in struggle.
My partner @charliekirk11 was able to spend time with one of my closest cousins (she’s like a sister), who lives in the projects. They loved one another. It’s been really cool to introduce Charlie to lifestyles and communities he’s spoken about, but never really experienced.
I’m against welfare because I have family on welfare. My family understands that and is cool with it. When my mom used to kick me out of the house (like, all the time), I lived with my cousins on welfare. They are my closest family members. They understand my message.
Regarding welfare, my mother would like to clarify that although she now takes disability, she has ALWAYS had a job. 	My cousins that are on various  welfare programs would like to clarify with journalists that they don’t give a shit what‘s written— they will always have my back.
Today, both of my parents uttered the words “I am hurt” and “I am scared” to me. 	I would now like to make a statement to formally address the alcoholism in my family. https://t.co/ncfqtnvPTy
Not going to lie. It’s a great time to be a black American.  #MAGA https://t.co/0mAEkDCh4y

Winner. 😂😂😂 Love it. https://t.co/fYOTQEiBjv
I am really excited to announce that I will be writing an op-Ed in a major publication. The topic will be about how ”journalists” have become closet sadists (those who derive pleasure from inflicting pain or humiliation on others).	Title suggestions?
Today my immediate family contacted me—in worry, panic, and pain.		I would like to issue the following statement as a result: https://t.co/jb3EJO5Ody
You didn’t know, Don? 	“Vote for Dems because you’re stupid enough to believe that everyone that’s not a Democrat, is racist.”		That’s literally the party platform https://t.co/hE0PTLPICo

This is really cool, @KimKardashian. I wish more celebrities would use their platforms to fight for what they love, as opposed to shouting at what they hate. 	Prison reform is an important issue that’s close to my heart. Xx https://t.co/qFCQBJgBnj

Kim Kardashian wasn’t offering a baseless opinion on stage at the Emmy’s. She is, and has been doing something actionable about an issue that she cares deeply about. 		It’s okay to be wrong sometimes, Ben. Really. 	Nothing bad happens when you don’t know everything. https://t.co/ETB6UlQCpC
To those of you asking for the end of the clip— this was my full response to this incredible young man (and yes, of course we hugged!)		I am so inspired by the raw courage I felt coming out of him. 		I thank God for the blessing of having been able to witness this. 		#MAGA https://t.co/ssEcFsuGpm
This is AMAZING. Congratulations @DineshDSouza!! I’ve learned so much from you on this political journey. Your work is astounding, and what happened to you was downright terrible. 		What an exciting day for you and your family (and your many fans). 		God Bless 🇺🇸 #MAGA https://t.co/vHR129dRdl
1) Don’t talk down to me. Ever again. 	2) This was not a photo-op. The POTUS takes a pic w/ every person that he meets with in the Oval Office. 	3)You have a way of complicating everything in an effort to be right about things that simply don’t matter. 	4) It’s getting old. https://t.co/pNRhzW8CfC
What @KimKardashian is working on is undeniably admirable. She’s not fighting for climate change, she’s fighting for a grandmother who is spending life-in-prison for a vastly unjust, over-sentencing. 	@benshapiro is there something more noble she should be doing w/ her platform?
No one said @KimKardashian was an expert. She did spend a ton of her own money to hire a legal team that has been working the Alice Marie Johnson case for years. 	Just bc someone is a celebrity does not mean they are not fighting for a just cause. 	She deserves to be heard. https://t.co/BsME7hHkCs

Kim has been working tirelessly to get a black woman pardoned from prison. He is not “worshipping” a celebrity, he is working with an American who is dedicated to prison reform in the black community. https://t.co/imDTCcpPsr
I rarely get emotional, but this young man waking up to the lies of the Democrats almost brought me to tears.	The media can lie, try to smear, or ignore us—but there is nothing they can do to stop the black revolution that is unfolding.	Thank you God, for this moment. #MAGA https://t.co/PyHNGRJKlW
They rarely receive attention for it (nor do they want it) but the work that Jared Kushner and @IvankaTrump have done in regards to prison reform cannot be overstated. 	Thank you both. https://t.co/SS7HPr6bIl
The world is changing before our eyes. Tonight at Stanford, a black student stepped to the mic. He said he used to support Black Lives Matter until he researched their lies. He shouted to a packed room “BUT NOW I’M FREE”. 	The Black Revolution is unfolding and it’s beautiful.

This story broke my heart. It is my deepest hope that @realDonaldTrump will consider a pardon for this man. Trump has made great strides already in the area of prison reform and this story is worthy of his attention.  		No American deserves this. 		#MAGA https://t.co/H7YNLo5dDZ

For far too long, the conversations about race have been dishonest. We have pointed the finger at white people, while ignoring the tracks that lead straight back to our dependency on government.  		A government policy won’t fix black America. Drug dealers don’t sell sobriety.
Victimhood is a drug. Liberals are the addicts. 	I’m sober.

While I’m a sucker for a sob story, you know nothing about me or my family. Nice try, but you won’t beat me at this oppression Olympics event.		You know what else feeds a family? Money, a job, and parents stable enough to secure both before bringing children into this world. https://t.co/chtWBQyNVP
Jewish and Asian Americans have made significant economic gains in this country with hardly any political representation in the government. 	When will the black community learn that black politicians do not equate to black progress?
Black poverty rate fell by 40% between 1940-1950, and black income grew at a rate higher than white income. 	Blacks did better during the era of Jim Crowe than we are doing now after two terms of a black president, plus 10,000+ elected black politicians. 		How?
This is so me. 	Sorry @TheDemocrats, you’re not getting this one back. 	#FREE https://t.co/I6aIRKxh92

This is impressively stupid. A fire department is not an example of socialism. That is an example of the public paying for a public service that we may all use. When I pay for a family on welfare to have a flat screen TV, I don’t get to come over and watch it. 		Get it? https://t.co/5eUBSWDiSJ
I can’t imagine getting to age 38, referring to myself as a “political analyst” and still not knowing that the Republican and Democrat Party never switched. 		You have to make a concerted effort to avoid A LOT of books. This amount of wrong takes effort. 😂😂 https://t.co/IAyfqerExd
I really love the way @KimKardashian defends her family. https://t.co/CzR7G0WqNO
Many people want the status quo disrupted but hate disruptors.
There are people who would rather be right, than to see America win. There is a higher need for individual recognition than for collective peace. 	Trump came out of nowhere. 	Similarly, I came out of nowhere. 	Despite our effectiveness, political puritans hope we fail. https://t.co/DwkUMwT0uQ
I’m not destroying a monolith on the left to help create one on the right. I’m a free thinker. 	The conservative-purity movement is a social justice warrior rebrand. 		The holier than thou “how could you possibly think” crap needs to stop across the board.
Having a debate. If we polled every single person in the world— who would be the most recognizable athlete. Who’s name and face is more renown? 	@Cristiano or @TigerWoods
You mistook my comment. No one who follows me would ever support Farrakhan. He is an anti-semite who stands on the dead bodies of many.

There is a push in society to turn women into men, and men into women. 	I wonder, if over time, that makes women miserable. There is a lot of proof that it does.

Buzzfeed threatened 3 young women to write this piece? 😂😂	“Candace Owens once had a mental health blog where two teenagers once wrote two anti-Trump articles”		Such a joke. 		#MAGA https://t.co/PO1cao60fy

For the record @BuzzFeed, you do not scare me. I will not submit to your version of what I should be as a black woman in this society, or else feel the whip of a political hit piece. 		I am free &amp; I choose to be a PROUD supporter of President Donald J. Trump. 		#FreeThinker
Buzzfeed now verifying that it is “their job” to threaten to publish names of private young women who refuse to give quotes about their political targets. 	Btw- these young girls are all liberals who voted for Hillary. I am trying to get them to come forward publicly about this. https://t.co/tMDh3IY6Xj
You are a despicable creature for contacting and threatening a bunch of young women. Never contacted me once. It is abhorrent behavior to threaten the livelihood of college students for having been barely associated with me, years ago in a non-political setting. https://t.co/2mBQXLVXca
All of these young girls suffered through some sort of mental health condition (anxiety, depression, anorexia, etc). They are now being threatened by @BuzzFeed who is working on a hit piece. This is absolutely disgusting behavior from leftist media.
So @buzzfeed has spent the last week attempting to threaten current college students that I used to work with into giving statements about me. They told these young girls that if they didn’t give statements, they would print their names (effectively a threat to ruin their lives).

"Refugees bring their problems with them" -Black Panther Movie.		But when @realDonaldTrump said it, there were boycotts.
I liked that there were no white people only bc it demonstrated a power struggle playing out between blacks which I see happening today politically. Victims vs. Victors. Past vs. Future. https://t.co/STIxW1oLPI
Black Panther movie was excellent! Bc it was the black community vs. the black community. Blacks angry about their pasts vs. blacks focused on their futures. 		Take a guess which mentality wins in the end.		#blackpanthermovie #blackpanther

We tax cigarettes to get people to stop smoking. We tax alcohol to get people to stop drinking. So why do we tax people who work, and those that employ them? 	You cannot tax an economy into prosperity.

To clarify: my issue with @benshapiro (who I am a fan of) always jumping to assist every female accusation is that it gives life to the false modern-feminist claim that women are perpetual victims of the patriarchy. Women are not weak. 	We are mentally more cunning than men.
...you severely underestimate how vicious and cunning women can be when they feel scorned. The entire #metoo, something I adamantly oppose, is evidence of just that.		Not defending Porter, but I am defending Trump's willingness to believe a man to be innocent until proven guilty. https://t.co/YsFblzlOAm

Every single Democrat who voted against this #MemoDay is an enemy to the American people. 	Every single Democrat pushing for Nunes' resignation, should instead hand in theirs. 	@NancyPelosi...you are absolute scum, &amp; history will recall you as such. 		#MemoGate
The #Memo reveals what the American People already knew; the Obama administration colluded against @realDonaldTrump in an attempt to interfere with our election. 		We can no longer trust our intelligence agencies until EVERY SINGLE person involved is brought to justice.
The Democrats are beyond terrified about this memo. They are already working overtime trying to brand it a conspiracy theory. 		I literally cannot wait.
For too long, blacks that have been trying to help the black community have been labeled coons, while those that wish to destroy it have been celebrated as heroes. 	That chapter is coming to an end. 		BlackAmerica is on the brink of an ideological revolution. We can't be stopped.
We do not need a "black" caucus. We just need an American one. What I saw last night were black cowards, too afraid of their Democratic superiors to celebrate a historical triumph for our community.
If Obama had announced that black unemployment was at an all time low, the black caucus would have leapt to their feet and erupted into cheers. 	Their silence last night proves that they do not hold black interests. 		They are nothing more than slaves to the Democratic Party.
No exaggeration--my Facebook page has been SLAMMED with messages like this from Democrats. 		@realDonaldTrump absolutely NAILED the State of the Union. The left is in big trouble.  		 #MAGA #SOTU https://t.co/jdY7vXMeYz
