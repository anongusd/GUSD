The left is more Puritanical than the right, and it's just so tiresome.
And what Aurthur is doing here is clearly kink shaming - she thinks it's somehow hypocritical to treat a fan like a fan, just because of what they choose to do in their sex life!
The implication here - that because Tucker is a family values guy it's a problem that he's in a picture with an escort at a funeral - is just another example of how people don't get what Christian grace is in practice. Jesus hung out with prostitutes all the time.
Kate Aurthur is dragging Tucker Carlson for a selfie with a fan, who is also a sex worker, while they were attending a funeral for a mutual friend. He didn't know that's what she does, but I am sure he would have let her have a pic anyway. He's a Christian after all. https://t.co/IIN1Y0slf0

The American people want illegal immigration controlled and the violent lawlessness at the border brought to an end. The president proposed a wall. The American people elected him to build it.
The president should be the representative of the people against the unpopular Congress. Hold them to account for their failure.
The president @realDonaldTrump should in the SOTU take on the Congress itself. They are the reason there isn‚Äôt wall funding and they are the reason the government is ticking down to a shutdown.

Of course, Bre would have just laughed about this, because she was a better person than I am. For me, it's just another example of how vile some media people can be.
In over 1,000 articles written at The Federalist, Bre never "campaigned against vaccines". We are also told she got her flu shot this year. Doesn't matter to the media - here's a sarcastic tweet we can misinterpret!
The idea that a lone sarcastic Tweet posted when you were a teenager could be used by international media organizations to smear you with fake news is the new reality.

Listen to @unspooled as they watch all 100 of the top AFI movies, just be prepared for Amy to politicize everything, including comparing Mitch McConnell to a ringwraith.
The @replyall episodes on spam calls and QAnon are great, but the Crime Machine episodes about NYC policing should win an award.
Episodes of LORE sometimes irritate me, but when they are good they're very good.
A new hilarious addition to my queue is Something's Off With @MightyHeaton which has some excellent sponsors I'd like to acquire.
Started listening to @ConanOBrien Needs a Friend. Don't miss the latest episode where Nick Offerman has sex in front of a coyote and fixes his bike with a rock, like a man does, but not at the same time.
The interviews on @Recode with @karaswisher are must listen, particularly with prominent guests. She has no filter or guile, she just plows into the questions they don't want to answer.
I really enjoyed this season of @Harmontown but I also learned that Dan would be a way too talkative DM which was disappointing. His rant about Red Dead was amazing though.
I wish there was a new Acquisitions Inc episode every week. But @FearInitiative helped fill that void. Needed more of @RobSchrab, that slacker.
Serial was very hit or miss this season. I was mostly bored but occasionally very angry.
I am a big fan of @SongExploder - they roll out some excellent artist interviews about the songs you didn't know you love. Don't miss the Black Keys Bojack episode.
Of course @PardonMyTake remains captain of my heart, but I worry that PFT's increasingly woke approach to life will lead to a divorce, perhaps to be replaced by ARod given the success of that spinoff?
I listen to @ThisShowStinks every day, where an aging orange bald sportswriter tries desperately to promote the neighborhood bar he bought in a fit of dementia, while surrounded by the inane blather of out of touch Boomer friends. The best guest by far is @CillizzaCNN.
Now moving beyond politics: I love @billburr's Monday Morning Podcast, HEY HOW ARE YA, and not just for the ads and the problematic bits, but mostly for those.
You should definitely listen to Against The Grain, @HotlineJosh's podcast, which is as insidery as it gets on political machinations.
Never miss an episode of @wethefifth - it is the best in the biz when talking about big picture cultural topics, @kmele is brilliant, @mcmoynihan is fucking hilarious, @MattWelch is a perfect downer, and @anthonyLfisher should talk more.
I also enjoy @RubinReport very much, though you have to listen at normal speed given the depth of discussion.
I don't listen to many political podcasts. But @davidaxelrod has a very good interview show, and his guests really open up.

"And when the last scene of all comes, and death takes his master in its embrace and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way...
"If fortune drives the master forth, an outcast in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him, to guard him against danger, to fight against his enemies.
"When riches take wings, and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens...
"He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer; he will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounter with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all other friends desert, he remains."
"A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and poverty, in health and sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow, and the snow drives fiercely, If only he can be near his master's side...

Jesse Kelly will be on with Tucker Carlson at 8:30 tonight to talk about being banned by Twitter.
The truth, with Twitter rules, is that it's Calvinball all the way down. And that's why an invocation to live by them makes no sense.
Because they can always redefine the terms. They can always fudge what the standard is. They can always determine calling one person a Nazi is fine but another is not.
That's why Jack Dorsey has the hubris to lie to Congress about harassment against conservatives. 	https://t.co/5ndqSciIq1
That is because of something Shafer either doesn't understand or doesn't want to acknowledge: that for Twitter, there are no rules.
Instead, his lack of a clear violation clearly caused frustration - so at the end of the day, they just pulled the plug on him, permanently, without justifying it under any rule or citing any activity whatsoever.
Jesse Kelly engaged in iconoclasm and teased without threatening people or violating any rules. If he had, Twitter would've gone after him for it.
That is exactly what Jesse Kelly did! We know that because in the two years since he was verified he received not a single suspension or even a warning.
Shafer suggests conservatives ought to "Drive Twitter insane by playing by their rules, expressing yourself right up to the boundary-line of the company‚Äôs standards in a way that will invite inspection and self-criticism of those standards."

How I, a poor college dropout from Mississippi, have yearned to see the majesty of Russian architecture, to weep at the tombs of the heroes of the people.
Of course, I have never been to Russia, and the most time any member of my family has spent there was in service of Bob Gates, Secretary of Defense.
Today the mentally disturbed Menschians were out in force again claiming I am an incredibly talented Kremlin spy who played a long game to marry my wife. I have sacrificed so much in this effort, I will never see the Red Square again.

The whole world is at war over ideas. So let's have those deeply held ideas fought over by avatars on the stage, instead of yelled about by frustrated viewers on street corners and in restaurants.
We need brasher, smarter, and more confrontational public debate about the ideas that make people deeply uncomfortable because if we don't get it in media, the pent up frustration turns into abject rage expressed in places where we should be civil.
The enemy of truly valuable public debate is the domesticated guest... The person who has heard the producer in their ear saying "be nice!" and listened.
One of the things stupid people say is that they wish WFB was still around because oh wasn't he smart on the TV. But WFB would never be allowed on air today because he also refused to be domesticated. He was more confrontational than anyone!
There are the guests who are supposed to win, and there are the clay pigeons who are supposed to shatter, and in between there are the sad former friends of the clay pigeons to provide play by play to the shattering.
Places like @IQ2US and @munkdebate are the rare and important exceptions - but if you consume most media, debate is either absent or uneven.
Today if you are a media consumer, you will rarely find entities that feature ongoing, representative, and confrontational public debate.
The Founders hated each other. The period from 1790 on was marked by the worst behavior possible toward each other. However! They also had a running and ongoing confrontational public debate.
Is it possible our lack of public civility is a symptom of a lack of truly confrontational public debate?

@jason_pontin Happens with underclass/non-citizens in other nations, particularly India, and gypsy populations in parts of Europe. Give up your kid so they can have a better life.
One potential outcome of rolling back birthright citizenship is a spike in illegal immigrants abandoning babies in hospitals, since adoption by American citizens would remain a path to citizenship.

@vincentdonofrio Thank you for making great television!
"Four days before shooting on the episode began, NBC censors provided 17 pages of notes to Yoshimura requiring changes regarding violence and language. A typical¬†Homicide: Life on the Street¬†episode usually results in only three or four pages."
The assistant on this episode,Joe Lusco,would eventually write much of The Wire.
"Incident was the most upsetting thing he ever saw. He likened the twisting of the body to that of a plastic bag being spun around quickly turning like a corkscrew; when the train was removed and body twisted back, "All your guts fall down and in less than a minute, you're dead."
This episode shows Barry Levinson's influence on the series. It is basically a theater piece, one stage with a man slowly dying.
Homicide is one of the best TV shows ever made. Phenomenal cast, too. Andre Braugher, Richard Belzer, Melissa Leo, Yaphet Kotto, Jon Polito, Kyle Secor, Ned Beatty, Michelle Forbes, Clark Johnson, Daniel Baldwin, and of course Giancarlo Esposito.
This episode also deals with the frequent and uncomfortable reality of paramedics calming down someone who is headed toward death.
The central bias of this episode is like something from Hawthorne - we the audience all know someone is going to die, but they have that realization slowly dawn on them.
It also features an incredible performance by @vincentdonofrio https://t.co/CknA2cLWZj
Directed by Gary Fleder and written by James Yoshimura, it inspired an X-Files episode that directly led to the casting of Bryan Cranston as Walter White.
The best episode of television ever made is "Subway" from season 6 of Homicide.

(Or was it Ava Gardner? There are disputes about this in the bios. Either way, both men had multiple female tensions between them.)
From The Times: "At one point during the weekend rampage Sinatra was quoted as saying, "I built this hotel from a sand pile and I can tear the hotel down and before I'm through that is what it will be again!"
The lesson of all this is: Howard Hughes had a long memory, monitor your lady's gambling, and no one knew how to make an exit like Frank.
He goes upstairs, gets Mia, trashes the penthouse, leaves on his private jet, and the next day announces his new affiliation - with Caesar's Palace, across the street. 	https://t.co/O1K5C9LtDR
But Frank isn't done, no sirree. 		So he gets on a golf cart and drives it through a window. 		https://t.co/LfFWuYDcYQ
Sinatra begins yelling obscenities. The casino's VP is summoned. There is an altercation. Sinatra throws chips into the much larger man's face. Sinatra gets slugged in the mouth. He loses two teeth.
Frank Sinatra asks for credit. And he is denied it. 		This is not a good idea.
Sinatra, already having performed and several Jack Daniels in, is furious - and decides he will go doen and win it back. He buys $50k in chips. Poof, it's gone.
Sinatra doesn't find out about this for a while - he was on a winning streak. But then one night while he is performing, Mia heads to the tables and in short order loses $20k.
So Hughes installs a new limit on Sinatra: just $3,000 in credit a night. Enough that Frank will only run into it after he's been losing for a bit... or his lady friend.
One of these changes was cutting off Frank Sinatra's credit. You can say it was because Hughes was a penny pincher. A better case can be made that he always blamed Sinatra for blocking Hughes' pathetic attempts to woo Rita Hayworth.
Hughes bought The Sands as part of his overall goal to reform Las Vegas, making it friendlier and more inviting. He bought up casinos, bought the local CBS affiliate, and made changes.
Sinatra was the king of Vegas. But the same year, another king arrived, who wanted to get rid of the mob and the special treatment for aging stars - Howard Hughes.
In 1966, he recorded the greatest Live album of his career. Sinatra At The Sands featuring the Count Basie Orchestra is still an incredible listen, particularly his banter with the audience. "You want to meet Monday, we'll pick out the furniture?"
The Rat Pack would fall on harder times over the years, but other than mob connections and gossip columns - "Frank, I drink scotch older than her" - Sinatra withstood it.
The Summit at the Sands, in early 1960, was the Rat Pack at the height of their powers. Martin, Davis, Bishop, Lawford, and tons of celebrities - even JFK showed up.
For context, understand that Sinatra had been performing in The Sands' Copa Room since 1953. He had become the Strip's biggest star, and for years could get away with anything.
Just a terrible failure of a news segment on @ThisShowStinks the other day featuring Fake News Nigel's attempt at a description of why Frank Sinatra left The Sands after years of headlining in 1967.

"The point is that there is a creed, if not about divine, at least about human things."	- G.K. Chesterton, "What I Saw In America."
"Nobody expects a modern political system to proceed logically in the application of such dogmas, and in the matter of God and Government it is naturally God whose claim is taken more lightly.
"It certainly does condemn anarchism, and it does also by inference condemn atheism, since it clearly names the Creator as the ultimate authority from whom these equal rights are derived.
"It enunciates that all men are equal in their claim to justice, that governments exist to give them that justice, and that their authority is for that reason just.
"America is the only nation in the world that is founded on creed. That creed is set forth with dogmatic and even theological lucidity in the Declaration of Independence; perhaps the only piece of practical politics that is also theoretical politics and also great literature.
