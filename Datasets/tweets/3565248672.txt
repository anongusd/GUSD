COHEN prepared remarks continued: "In private he is even worse... And he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid. And yet I continued to work for him."
" and that Mr. Assange told Mr.  Stone that within a couple of days there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton's campaign. Mr Trump. responded by stating to the effect of "wouldn't that be great."
"In July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump's office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone. Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange..."
"A lot of people have asked me about whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of time. The answer is yes."
"...He wanted me to lie. He made it clear to me because his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before I gave it to Congress."
COHEN remarks: "Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign...He lied about it bc he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it bc he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project."
"Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That's not how he operates.... At the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there's no business in Russia and ten go out and lie to the American people..."
COHEN Prepared Remarks  !!!! : "I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat. He was a presidential candidate who knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of DNC emails."
NEW: COHEN jabs at Trump ties in prepared remarks for tomorrow.		"I regret all the help and support I gave [Trump] along the way." 		"I am ashamed of my weakness and misplaced loyalty -- of the things I did for Mr. Trump in an effort to protect and promote him."

The 24 hour news cycle and the unprecedented scale of the internet -- 400 hours of video uploaded every minute to YouTube, a couple of billions of uploads on Facebook, and 350,000 tweets sent per minute on Twitter -- will play a major role in the unhindered spread of deepfakes.
Another thing that struck me while writing this story about deepfakes -- that is common in the tech world -- are these names that hardly are self-explanatory. 		One friend I talked to asked if a deepfake was something out of an R-rated film.		This is hurting public awareness.
Experts and @RepAdamSchiff told me said it would be likely turn into a technological race between the tools used to create deepfakes and methods to counter them.		But that isn't very reassuring. It is going to be a method to stanch the wound, not heal it.
Hany Farid told me the current digital landscape has created the "perfect storm" for deepfakes to wreak havoc,		We have the ability to create misinformation, easily distribute it widely, and have a welcoming public that is going to consume it without a second thought, he said.
Experts say it is only a matter of time before advances in A.I. tech and the proliferation of those tools allow any online user to create deepfakes.		‚ÄúIt is almost too late to sound the alarm before this technology is released ‚Äî it has been unleashed,‚Äù Sen. @MarkWarner told me.
And imagine what the economic consequences might be for the stock markets if a fake video or audio recording surfaces in which someone like Jeff Bezos appears to privately tell shareholders that the online retailer's profits are actually down 25% from their previous projections.
Imagine what the consequences might be for maintaining the integrity of an election if a video falsely portrays a candidate committing a heinous act or making a controversial remark days before the polls close.
Imagine what the geopolitical consequences might be if a deepfake appears to show President Trump declaring he was launching a nuclear war against North Korea + that video goes viral -- would the North Korean leader react prematurely before determining whether it is fake or real?
Imagine what the natsec consequences might be if terrorist organizations like ISIS &amp; al Qaeda gained access to this type of technology -- they could manufacture realistic videos of American soldiers committing brutal atrocities on the battlefield for propaganda + recruiting.
My story on how lawmakers + experts are sounding the alarm about "deepfakes," warning that these A.I. manipulated videos will be the next phase in disinformation campaigns.		They can be weaponized / could cause serious disruption, damage, or even deaths.		https://t.co/76QbCgYzb8

@jacq_thomsen @mchalfant16 helped me comb through the 173 pages of the Comey transcript. Reading through their notes and stumble across this:		"BREAKING NEWS ON PAGE 73 -- COMEY TAKES ‚ÄòQUICK‚Äô BATHROOM BREAK"
@RepGoodlatte : Did any country other than Russia attempt to influence tje election?		Comey says: I don't want to give adversaries -- we're in an unclassified setting -- an idea of what we did / didn't know ...so the answer would be I believe so -- nations other than Russia.
The state of things re. Comey transcript.		Chairman @RepGoodlatte : I haven't asked that yet.		FBI lawyer: I understand that. I just don't want the witness to blurt something out either.		Chairman Goodlatte: He doesn't seem disposed to blurt things	out.
For my friends who are fascinated w/ the FISC like @KatieBoWill , here is Comey weighing in on questions of how to streamline/restructure the Foreign Intel Surveillance Court's authorities https://t.co/MY28fdFOh3
@Comey: "Bc the culture of this Nation, the culture of an	institution like the FBI, there's no deep state. There's a deep	culture in the military, in the IC, in the FBI ...a commitment to integrity	+ the rule of law. No President serves long enough to screw	that up."
Per transcript, Comey uses a line that is almost the exact same to the one he relayed later to the press.		"Republicans used to believe, I think, that a President's words matter, that institutions matter, that the rule of law matters, and that the truth matters."
Comey, per transcript, recalls that Dana Boente, the former acting attorney general, said: "Oh, God, I was hoping that would go away." 		A comment he made after President Trump followed up on his request that the FBI/DOJ go public that he is not under investigation.
The transcript so far:		@TGowdySC : Can you understand my curiosity why you would	publish a private comment to make sure it did not impact them but	not take up a public comment to make sure it did not impact them?		Comey's lawyer, Kelley: Is that a question?		Gowdy: Yes.

Comey has repeatedly corrected Dems + Rs on this one point:		"I have to disagree with your assertion that it was a counterintelligence investigation into a political campaign. I've said that earlier, that it wasn't.	It was four counterintelligence files on four Americans."
Comey on President's pick to serve as next Attorney General: "I think [Barr is] certainly fit to be Attorney General. As I said, I think very highly of him. Whether he should be involved in those particular cases (Russia or Clinton probes) or not is a question I can't answer."
@RepJerryNadler  "Is there any evidence of inherent bias displayed at the	highest levels of the DOJ and the FBI regarding how and why the Hillary Clinton email probe ended?"	@Comey "Not that I'm aware of."
MAJOR defense of Mueller by @Comey : "There are not many things I would bet my life on. I would bet my life that Bob Mueller will do things the right	way, the way we would all want, whether we're Republicans or Democrats, the way Americans should want."
Comey says he "never saw any indications" bias from Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. https://t.co/zF50HaEzKg
Q: If Mueller were fired, how would that affect further probes of crime that are ongoing now?		@Comey answer:"I don't know. And as an informed outsider, I think that it would -- you'd almost have to fire everyone in the FBI and the DOJ to	derail the relevant investigations..."
Cheeky.		Lawmaker: Making a false public statement ordinarily	is not a crime (as opposed to making a false statement to the FBI), correct?		Comey. That is correct. Thank goodness, for a lot of	people.
@Comey on Strzok/Page texts: "I would have certainly been open to listening	to any explanation, but when you're the leader of a justice agency, the appearance of bias is as important as the existence of actual bias."
@Comey on Strzok-Page texts: "If Id known about those things that they were communicating that I've seen in open source, I wouldnt have had them stay on ..playing any role in connection w/ that" probe.	Gowdy: Would you've fired them?	Comey: That I can't answer in the abstract.

RT @AaronMehta: This weird Twitter alert bug is fun because it shows me which of you sociopaths have twitter notifications enabled.
@jeremyherb I'm getting them too.....
And this is just the start of the @HouseJudiciary business this week.		@RepMarkMeadows said former FBI chief counsel James Baker is expected to come in this week to finish questioning and Nellie Ohr, Bruce Ohr's wife, is expected to testify on Friday.
@RepMarkMeadows also took aim at @joshlevyesq , describing him as a media opportunist / ex-lawyer for  Schumer who is "looking for a moment on all the networks.		"His client that refused to answer today...I would expect nothing less for him to attack credibility" of this probe.
@RepMarkMeadows said the panel will be having discussions in the ‚Äúcoming days‚Äù on whether they will move to hold Simpson in contempt for refusing to testify.		"You cannot just invoke the Fifth to avoid answering congressional questions,‚Äù Meadows told reporters.
‚ÄúUnfortunately, if you are not one of the president‚Äôs men, these congressional Republicans will show utter disdain for your constitutional rights," Levy continued.
‚ÄúEven this congress last year did nothing when members of the president‚Äôs staff invoked their privileges or outright just decided not to comply with subpoenas,‚Äù Levy said, pointing to Bannon and Michael Flynn.
He also described a double standard, pointing to Stephen Bannon's refusal to cooperate with House Intel despite a GOP-issued subpoena and getting away w/ it.		This is something @RepAdamSchiff + other Intel Dems warned would weaken power of congressional subpoenas.
Levy compared GOP efforts to McCarthyism.	‚ÄúLike Sen McCarthy, this committee has largely conducted its business in secret confidential interviews and depositions, binding witnesses &amp; their counsels to silence," while members walk outside and selectively leak from those interviews
Levy, a lawyer representing Glenn Simpson/Fusion GPS (firm tied to dossier), issued a scathing rebuke of House Judic/Oversight panels today when Simpson pled the Fifth, refusing to testify.		Basically calls it a smear campaign against DOJ that aims to undermine Mueller's probe.

Simpsons lawyers say House GOP are leading a probe that ‚Äúis not designed to discover the truth.‚Äù		‚ÄúThis Committee has repeatedly interviewed witnesses in secret, only to selectively leak from the interviews to disparage those witnesses and promulgate a patently false narrative."
‚ÄúThe obvious...goal of this Committee is to discredit and otherwise damage witnesses to Russia‚Äôs interference in the 2016 election, all as part of an effort to protect a President who has sought to placate and curry favor with a hostile foreign power..." they wrote
The lawyers accused the panels' Republicans of seeking to ‚Äúruin the reputations of some of the government‚Äôs most dedicated and experienced civil servants,‚Äù in an attempt to ‚Äúweaken the independence of this Justice Department" -- naming Bruce Ohr and Christopher Steele
Actually, i believe the count is 3 committees.

All of these quotes touch on the GOP's views to threaten to move forward -- or not -- with contempt proceedings depending on who a particular witness is and how they cooperated with lawmakers.
I also asked Gowdy yesterday if failing to follow through on contempt threat with Bannon watered down power of congressional subpoenas: He said: ‚ÄúI do not think we watered down the subpoena power by refusing to waterboard someone until they talk to us.‚Äù
"I believe he said this morning, ‚ÄòYou can show up and plead the fifth, that is your right. She didn‚Äôt even show up. I think there is a distinction.‚Äô...You have a legal to plead the fifth, but to just not show up is a little bit different.‚Äù
I asked Paul Ryan spox yesterday on Goodlatte's threat to hold Lisa Page in contempt if she did not testify by Friday (they have since reached agreement for her to testify tmrw). 	She said: ‚ÄúWell Bannon showed up. Page didn‚Äôt even show up. That is the point."
Earlier today, Rep. Eric Swalwell made a motion that the committee subpoena Stephen Bannon, who months previous defied a subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee. Republicans at the time had threatened contempt, but never followed through b/c he did eventually appear.
GOP lawmakers are threatening to hold #PeterStrzok in contempt for failing to answer some of the questions they've asked him during this hearted hearing (that he has been advised by FBI general counsel not to answer, amid ongoing Russia probe).

#Rosenstein: We are taking a lot of steps to protect against election interference...
Wray, again, stands by intelligence community's assessment that concluded Russia sought to interfere in 2016 election.
There has been quite a bit of political grandstanding by lawmakers (on both sides) during this House Judiciary hearing with DOJ's Rosenstein and FBI's Wray

Jordan: Who are we supposed to believe? Staff members who we‚Äôve worked with, who have never misled us, or you guys who we‚Äôve caught hiding information from us?		Rosenstein: You should believe me because I am telling the truth and I am under oath.
Rosenstein: Mr. Jordan I appreciate you saying it isn‚Äôt personal, sir. Sometimes it feels that way. How do I know, sir? You interviewed Mr. Strzok, I didn‚Äôt, so I can‚Äôt--		Rep. Jordan: Works for you, doesnt work for us. 		Rosenstein: There are 115,000 people who work for me, sir.

Rep. Jim Jordan: "I don‚Äôt know why you won‚Äôt give us what we‚Äôve asked for.‚Äù		Rosenstein: ‚ÄúSir, I certainly hope that your colleagues are not under that impression. It is not accurate sir ‚Äî‚Äù		Jordan: ‚ÄúIt is accurate. We have caught you hiding information ‚Äî

#DOJ spox tells me newly appointed US attorney overseeing FBI doc production expected to meet w/ "members to discuss his new role and to ensure that members are confident that the Department is producing the relevant documents completely and with integrity and professionalism."
@RepMarkMeadows tells me "Rosenstein's actions to this point clearly demonstrate that he has no serious intention to comply with Congressional oversight efforts. His decision to outsource the decision making to a U.S. prosecutor will do very little, if anything, to change that."
Jordan says 2nd special counsel is necessary b/c the attorneys the DOJ has assigned to look into certain matters report to Rosenstein.	"Who does Huber answer to? Who does Lausch answer to? They all answer to Rod Rosenstein...So can these employees really investigate the boss?" https://t.co/WYGDDLP2Av
"If we get the same heavily redacted [documents], what good is that?" Jordan said, repeating his calls for a second special counsel. https://t.co/WYGDDLP2Av
@Jim_Jordan tells me he isnt satisfied by recent promises the DOJ to produce more documents related to the panel's the FBI‚Äôs decision-making during the 2016 presidential election. Calling their pledge the "same baloney" they've heard before ‚Äî "not much of an improvement."
