@chiefgreyfox @BernieSanders That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
My Texan uncle, H.O. Smith, was at the big 100th anniversary #TexasIndependenceDay celebration on March 2, 1936, and he's determined to be there on the 200th, coming up in 2036. If anybody can do it, this tough Vietnam veteran can.
Pardon me, but how could a President of the United States give a 2 hour, 2 minute speech on March 2 and NOT wish everyone a happy #TexasIndependenceDay

True story: When Ed Nixon arrived at our airport, some TSA agents appeared to think they’d seen the ghost of Richard Nixon. Ed was good natured and posed for a photo—giving the famous Nixon farewell two-armed victory wave. Ed was far more convincing than Roger Stone. RIP Ed Nixon
RIP Ed Nixon. We hosted Ed here @UVA and kept in touch. He closely resembled his brother the President⁦ (17 years older) but Ed had a successful career as a geologist. My students enjoyed his wide-ranging talks &amp; recollections. @nytimes⁩  https://t.co/8TsH8Asa08
@NedFL It's close, yes, and might flip. But look at the recent record. The GOP has won even in years that should have been favorable to Dems. And for even demographic trend that is favorable to Ds, there's one favorable to Rs. Proof's in the pudding.

@mike_littwin Overconfidence has killed a party's chances in quite a few elections. Confidence good, overconfidence bad!
@ZhanikB You left out CO. There could easily be others, too, though the norm today is the party that carries a state presidentially will very probably take the Senate seat too.
@mglovin @AndrewCFollett Possible. Ask an economist. Come to think of it, better ask 20 of them.
@jostonjustice This map is our traditional baseline two years out. Probably will evolve. Usually does.
@PierreAtlas @ReallyAwakenNow For the record, I'm opposed to anyone being whacked. ;)
@DrDenaGrayson Yes, to the extent that preliminary data are available. Few new registrants so far, little effect on party balance, but with a big D effort, that might change. But the FL D party just blew races for GOV and Senator in a year when environment favored Ds.
@christyree69 You can argue that. But it's a potential. Few new registrations, little movement so far--and you'll be surprised at how many Rs are in that new poll of potential voters.

Michael Cohen is not John Dean. Dean never lied to Congress. But Dean also didn’t know Nixon nearly as well as Cohen knows Trump. Cohen had a much longer period of up-close observation of Trump than did Dean with Nixon.

@tptroll Nixon actually wanted to name John Connally, his Treasury Secretary who had become R by then (TX Gov wounded in JFK murder). But Ds controlled both houses of Congress, would not have confirmed Connally. Ford had defended Nixon strongly during Watergate, could be confirmed.

@AdeleCulp The Justice Dept was right to handle it as they did. Why? Nixon was teetering and that meant that a two-bit crook (Agnew) could become president any day. They had to get him out of the VP office.
@Danielnichols79 @maddow The documents were clearly shown and vetted in advance. Now as I said, I had never heard of this, but it does fit perfectly with everything we know in the record about Agnew.
@JohnSHausman @maddow Written by Agnew speechwriter, later NYTimes columnist, William Safire, along with lots of others (pusillanimous pussyfooters, etc.).
@KMeerschaertJax I think he died there, didn't he?
@kabindra @maddow I still use it in class. Humorous yet deadly serious.
@morningj Not at all. Agnew couldn't even carry the state for Nixon in 1968 despite being Governor! Agnew got picked because he was obscure and none of the party bosses--who had vetoed all the good choices--had anything against him. Chosen late in the night when Nixon had to pick someone.
Agnew remained furious at Nixon and his crew because he believed they abandoned him quickly in 1973 (as though Nixon didn't have enough scandal without adding Agnew's on top). But I recall Agnew attended Nixon's funeral in 1994. Agnew himself died in 1996 at 77.
After resignation, Agnew sank into obscurity fairly quickly, only occasionally popping up in the news. He wrote a novel, "The Canfield Decision"(1976), which was criticized for being anti-Israel &amp; anti-Semitic. Like Nixon, Agnew believed "the Jews" ran the "liberal news media".
It's mind-blowing to realize Agnew would have been POTUS if he'd just not taken bribes. Nixon was doomed--though it's possible that Agnew was Nixon's 'insurance policy' against impeachment/conviction. I doubt it, though, After Agnew, Gerald Ford made removing Nixon much easier.
Non-lawyer Americans learned a new phrase on the day Agnew resigned in early October 1973: "nolo contendere". Not a guilty plea but acknowledgment that enough evidence existed to convict him. Second VP to resign (after John C. Calhoun) and the first one due to scandal.
Agnew was a common crook, taking bribes (sacks of money dropped in his desk) from MD contractors while he was Baltimore County Executive, MD Gov, and even VP. Prosecutors got him on tax evasion (shades of Al Capone) since he didn't pay taxes on bribe $.
Agnew even congratulated the crown prince on his "jihad" against Israel. No doubt Agnew needed the money, and Agnew would've said anything to get it. Yet it is flabbergasting to read.
Some shocking correspondence between ex-VP Spiro T. Agnew (who resigned in disgrace in 1973) and Saudi Arabia's crown prince was revealed on @maddow tonight. Agnew asked for big $$ to help him take on the Jews and the Zionists in the U.S.! I'd never heard of this.

@RachelBitecofer Exactly right.
@paolo_lim Not much. D still won in a landslide despite his well-publicized problems. Strong parties used to vet candidates carefully. We don't have strong parties anymore.
So far, at least, Virginians are separating their disappointment with Northam and Fairfax from their voting preferences. The state's Blue tilt is obvious in answers about 2019 legislative elections and 2020 contests for President and Senate. That could change if scandals drag on. https://t.co/oHWgGeu2zA
You can also sense the ambivalence among many people because there are still unanswered questions. Northam has told two entirely different stories about the racist photo, while the public wants a clearer resolution, if possible, on the very serious accusations against Fairfax. https://t.co/oHWgGeu2zA
Notice also that the public isn't keen on impeachment, certainly compared to resignation. Instinctively, people know that impeachment would end up being ugly and partisan, especially with the entire legislature on November's ballot. https://t.co/oHWgGeu2zA
What struck me in our poll with Ipsos was that Northam has taken a big hit in job approval at the same time as the public pulls back from wanting Northam to resign. Fairfax's troubles--which are severe--explain much of this. He's in no position to succeed Northam. https://t.co/oHWgGeu2zA

@richardmskinner No, but you have to exempt Civil War/early Reconstruction. Let's just say the Governors then weren't in charge of their own fate.
@CoreyBMiles You said it, I didn't. ;)
To be 100% sure, you can say "no VA impeachment in modern times" for GOV or Lt Gov. I define modern times as extending from the year of my birth (1952) to the present. Completely arbitrary but somehow it makes me feel younger.
Impeachment Trivia: I can find no serious impeachment effort for any VA Governor or Lt Gov from 1851 to present. 1851 VA Constitution established the 4-year term with no consecutive reelection, as well as the office of Lt Gov.

@dadofccx3 I’ll check but Northam won by a landslide margin. Since blacks produce 30-40% of the D primary vote, Northam almost certainly did very well.
@Rigel9000 If there was ever a contest you’d want to lose, it was this one.
Some seem fascinated by the fact that WaPo poll shows 58% of African-Americans don’t want Northam to resign. But Northam got 87% of the black vote in Nov. 2017. You could argue this is a drop in support of 29%. #CommonwealthofChaos

@DCclone Yes, if the interpretation of VA statutes and Constitution currently prevailing is upheld by, say, the VA Supreme Court (should it be challenged).
@EMatricardi Ed, I also think this may come down to a VA Supreme Court ruling. But the attorneys I've consulted on this believe (some reluctantly) that the GOV gets the appointment &amp; special election to follow. They disagree about whether GA would need to confirm the interim LG.
@szorowitz As I understand it, Northam would not be compelled to name someone as interim LG. He could leave the position vacant until special election.
@tedh13 At this point, I don't think you could get Northam out of the Governor's Mansion with a crowbar. He's decided he can ride it out.
@SpotsyHoya The VA constitutional experts, including the one who wrote much of it in the late 1960s/early1970s, disagree with you.

@ScottDougan1 @khats97 My guess is the special would be rescheduled to November of 2020, assuming the Northam resignation occurs too late for Democrats to pick a new LG nominee. Of course, maybe the Northam-chosen LG wouldn't be on the Nov2 019 special election ballot. Could be picked to become Gov.

Several of you have made an excellent point--the person chosen by Northam had better NOT be a crony of Northam's, who has become very unpopular very fast. The new Lt. Gov. would be well advised to keep Northam at arm's length, using a very long arm. #CommonwealthofChaos
VA Senate Democratic caucus—the 19 D senators who work with Justin Fairfax—just asked Fairfax to resign. Very bad news for him. #CommonwealthofChaos
Say Northam stays and Fairfax goes. Northam gets to appoint new Lt. Gov. until special election is held in Nov 2019. I'm not advocating for anyone but politically, you can argue the choice should be: squeaky clean + woman + person of color. Agree/disagree? #CommonwealthofChaos
@sdkstl Yes. But the voters would have their say in a November special election--or that's the procedure as I understand it. (Some are disputing this.)
@jon2allen No precedents for this, really--not in VA. And your second question: Generally yes, though I could see how serious crimes committed before the election, if revealed only during the term of office, could qualify.
@Mark_99nc Sure, two separate people and offenses. But I'm still waiting for someone to tell me how you're going to get Northam out if he doesn't want to go, and he doesn't. Impeachment criteria don't apply.
@kayemcelle I'd never write 'y'all'.
@david_darmofal He could but he won't. And there's a special election (if Fairfax resigns) in November 2019 so the temp LG would be in office only half a year until the voters get their say.
Articles of impeachment for Justin Fairfax. Not exactly good news for him—though it is a long and difficult process, just as at the federal level. #CommonwealthofChaos https://t.co/G6RgHfffVu
Northam has sent a short email to state employees (I’m one) saying he’s sorry for the hurt he’s caused but making it clear he’s going to continue in office. As I’ve said before, there’s no practical way to force a GOV out if his offense isn’t impeachable.#CommonwealthofChaos

@armandodkos If LG resigns or post is otherwise vacant afterwards, then appointment still made by Gov but special is at next general election in Nov 2020 for a one-year term. 4-year regular term up in Nov 2021.
@tomsherwood @kojoshow I’d bet a dollar neither goes. Herring is least likely to resign. Northam’s stalling/stubbornness worked—for him anyway, at least for now. His party? Another story.
Still no consensus on what happens if Lt. Gov. post comes vacant. But looking more likely that Gov (whoever it is) would appoint, no legislative confirmation, with special election in Nov. This is like 1971 except then-Gov. Linwood Holton made no temporary appointment.
Now that Northam, Fairfax, and Herring are going nowhere fast (and no doubt GOP Senate Majority Leader Tommy Norment too), this will play out more deliberately. That should nearly guarantee Dems retain Governor’s post since resignations (if any) will be staggered.

“Isolated incident” for Herring, perhaps, but not for @UVA. A certain element here has long thought blackface was amusing and acceptable. I favor automatic expulsion for any student engaging in this disgraceful conduct.
Everyone connected to @UVA should be embarrassed that AG Herring’s blackface was here. I know I am. And my guess is this wasn’t an isolated incident.
Yes, this really happened. Was said in a private meeting but took about 5 minutes to leak. How stupid. Really, really stupid. https://t.co/LdIzNj6BXq
On the other hand, Herring said nothing during Northam’s blackface turmoil, knowing full well he’d done something similar.
In the Trump era, the only way Republicans can win again statewide is for the Dems to be covered in scandal with a depressed base. (VA is strongly anti-Trump, now at least light Blue.) Hmm...Inside one week, all 3 D statewide officeholders are scandalized. Incredible coincidence.
Blackface is disgusting, always bad, and 1980 is awfully late to have realized that. But there are differences between Gov.Northam and AG Herring. Ex: Northam was 25, Herring 19. I see Herring has learned from Northam's inadequate statements. AG offers full, extensive apology.

@CEP_Observer @kkondik 140 out of 140 state legislators are Ds or Rs. Good luck with that one.
The temptations today are too great, especially for citizens who intensely dislike the incumbent POTUS. Dozens of cable channels, Netflix, games beckon. #SOTU is so mid-20th century (regrettably).
When I was growing up, back when only the big 3 (CBS,NBC,ABC) existed, just about everybody watched #SOTU regardless of their party. Sure, all nets covered SOTU so there was nothing else to see ("roadblocking"). But paying attention was considered obligatory for a good citizen
One reason why #SOTU matters less than it once did: Increasingly, people who watch are already supporters of any POTUS. R's were much less likely to watch Obama; Ds are much less likely to watch Trump. All about the base, again.

@RichKelsey I buy that (though others are disputing it). But every other major GOV appointment, including a substitute AG, must be confirmed/approved by both houses of the legislature. Not for LG? Really? GA may want to express itself, or even call for special election.
Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax(D-VA) might become Governor at age 39. Sounds young, but VA had an even younger Gov. in the last century: Harry F. Byrd Sr, age 38 when he took office in 1926. The irony is obvious. As a US Senator, Byrd led "Massive Resistance" to school desegregation.

@EMatricardi I've gotten ten different answers from ten good people. This needs sorting out whether Justin Fairfax succeeds or not.
@DemRulz Sure, because the statute at that time (since changed) did not call for any appointment but rather a special election held at the next general election. Sarge Reynolds died in June, D &amp; R parties both nominated by convention, and Henry Howell running as an Ind won in Nov with 40%
@PanamenoAracely @FairfaxJustin Yes
@dlmrain The succession for GOV is clear. We're talking about how to replace a vacant LG post. It last happened in 1971 under a different statute than exists today.
@ScottPaterno Yes, no question about it.
Pause on this one. Talked to several legal authorities. VA statues are confusing on LG replacement. Fairfax may not be able to appoint his replacement and there may very well not be a special election. State Supreme Court may decide or legislature may have to clarify law.
@tmobsessed No, no, he could run for a full GOV term in 2021.
@PaulWartenberg As I understand it.
@Rahtgee Yes
The last Lt Gov vacancy was in 1971, when Sarge Reynolds(D) died in June of a brain tumor. Special election won by Henry Howell(I) held in Nov 1971 for 2-year vacancy term. Law has changed. Fairfax would get to appoint his LG. Election for 2-years in Nov 2019. "Ralph Northam"
If Ralph Northam resigns, he'll be the 1st VA Gov since the civil war not to complete his term. VA appears to be the only state never to have had a succession in all those years. Also, if Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax becomes Gov, he would have the right to run for a full term in 2021.

@MortimerBrwstr Polls at the time and subsequent research back up my assertions. And Clinton got 43%. It was Bush who got 38%. Without Perot, his 19% would have been distributed among Clinton, Bush, non-voting etc. Very likely Clinton would have gained 7-10%.

John Anderson (1980) wasn't a critical factor but certainly didn't help Pres.Carter. Bill Clinton would have won a majority without Perot on ballot in '92 &amp; '96. Nader cost Gore the White House in '00. Stein cost Hillary MI and maybe WI &amp; more.
Day 3: Lots of theories about how @HowardSchultz will actually help Ds in 2020. Uh-huh. Anything's possible. But the last 3rd party/independent POTUS candidate to help Ds was not Ross Perot in '92 but George Wallace way back in 1968. (Nixon would have won easily w/out Wallace.)

Someone convinced @HowardSchultz that 40% of the electorate is “Independent”. In fact, that’s just a popular cover label for hidden partisans, who are quite loyal to their hidden party. True independents are few and far between in this highly partisan era.
We already knew billionaires aren’t smarter politically than the average precinct chair. @HowardSchultz is proving it again.
I listened carefully to @HowardSchultz on @60Minutes . He is far closer to the Democratic Party than the GOP, and is incredibly naive to think he won’t drain far more D votes than R ones.
What do you bet that the GOP and the Russians will do everything possible to surreptitiously promote @HowardSchultz among Democratic constituencies, to drain the maximum number of votes from the D POTUS nominee?
Has @HowardSchultz ever heard the old saying, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions?” Someone should explain it to him. His slogan might as well be, “Re-elect Trump”.
Not criticizing any other D POTUS candidate but so far at least, @KamalaHarris has had the strongest rollout--from planned events to media interviews. May not matter in the long (or medium) run, but it suggests strong organizational planning. #Kamala2020
@AlanNeff @NateSilver538 @gelliottmorris Way too early to know. But it's easy to see how, in the end, he might split off some proportion of the anti-Trump vote (a majority of Americans, after all)--and therefore, one would assume, take votes disproportionately from the D nominee. But again, too many unknowns right now.

@CTIronman @orrinknox @BryanDBender That did not make him a minor candidate.
@CTIronman @BryanDBender Clinton was never seen as a minor candidate by the political community, period. He was well known in political circles, had nearly run in 1988, etc. We’re simply discussing who was considered a minor candidate.
@orrinknox @CTIronman @BryanDBender Kerry was certainly not a minor candidate. He’d been a national figure since the Vietnam War.
@CTIronman @BryanDBender Clinton had been Governor for 12 years. Not the early favorite but certainly not a minor candidate.
@BryanDBender In modern times (FDR onwards), Carter is the only exception.  None of the other eventual presidents were considered to be minor figures/candidates by the political community when they announced. Yes, including Obama.

And the very bad news for the VA GOP comes on a day when they got some good news--No more BS from CS (Corey Stewart, who is retiring from politics after his disastrous US Senate race).
This is a big D win. The GOP's last hold on state power is the General Assembly. Ds only have to gain 2 seats for control of each chamber; all 140 seats are on the ballot this November (odd-odd-year elections here). No surprise: Trump has low ratings in VA. https://t.co/M176i4jw8e
@tomr515 And does anybody believe the loquacious Teddy Roosevelt ever fell silent? TR built a canal so maybe he thinks Trump is entitled to a wall.
@ChrisBastianBkl As I heard it, the networks were told the speech would be 8 minutes.
@schuttedan Third cousin of the Nigerian Prince.
@Libslady 3-way tie.
With Jimmy Carter’s denial, it’s now unanimous—no living ex-Presidents told Trump they supported the wall. But to be fair, what about the dead Presidents? After all, Nixon talked to the portraits on the White House wall back in 1974. Andrew Jackson’s right in Trump’s Oval Office.
The network fact-checking shouldn’t be limited to any lies in his 8-minute speech. The other recent lies should be highlighted—4,000 terrorists allegedly coming through the border, other presidents supposedly telling Trump they agree on the wall, etc. https://t.co/zUp8399Wvt
@smotus Obama has great power--to keep people watching. A greatly diminished audience watches the out-of-power party's response to State of the Union. That's why Obama would be better than Pelosi and many other suggested names.
Any network that gives President Trump time for his “national address” tomorrow evening on #TheWall is morally obligated to offer equal time to the opposition. Who should respond? I propose President Obama. It’s that important.

@bencampo Usually true, but then there's the 1980 disaster for Dems after just one term.
Yes, it's not hard to imagine Democrats' patented, circular firing squad returning after two years of bloodletting. And some nominees would be easier to unite around than others. Still, at this admittedly early point, I've heard no Dem say, "If X doesn't win, I'm walking."
Other than a likely record number of candidates (Sen. E. Warren today), what is different about 2020's Dem Prez contest? I've never heard so many Ds say, "I will vote, work for, &amp; donate to any D nominee against Trump." At least in this one way, Trump is a uniter, not a divider.

Nothing wrong with spirited competition, but Democrats, if you go too far and make war on one another, you could be helping Trump win a second term.

@BertClere @Mike_Stankiew Very probably not. And that's not as definitive as it could be.
@paolo_lim Only 30% disapprove Northam's job performance. 14% undecided. He's been in office less than a year, and isn't the sort to play to the cameras.
@Mike_Stankiew Yes indeed, but don't forget Richmond suburbs that have turned sharply D, plus a dozen major college areas with D totals ranging up to the 80%+ level. Again, Trump has reinforced and enhanced the D trends.

@norbiznesss Voter suppression is deeply disturbing and has become even more widespread of late. It should indeed be laid at the feet, in almost all cases of which I’m aware, of Republicans.
By popular demand, let me note that yes, there are considerably more R examples than D examples in this era. (I cited 2 R cases to 1 D case.) But there are bad D gerrymanders, too (MD comes to mind).
@armandodkos No, NJ Dems Re “reworking” the proposal. They haven’t dropped it, though one hopes they will.
@dansac We=our society. And NJ Dems are “reworking” this awful proposal. That’s not the same as killing it.

Rafael Cruz wasn't in the police basement 11/24/63. He WAS on the street in downtown Dallas (with 200,000) to watch JFK's motorcade go by 11/22. He WASN'T in Dealey Plaza. Shocker: Trump &amp; National Enquirer made it all up. (I met the senior Cruz in Dallas on Nov. 12 this year.) https://t.co/6FU6HKoZu8
So why did Dallas PD put on the big public show to transfer Oswald? Mainly, they wanted to counter widespread rumors that Oswald had been badly roughed up by investigators since his arrest. He hadn't been. But the 11/24/63 PR effort led to Oswald's murder.
First national reaction was "good riddance" to Oswald. But cooler heads realized his murder would make it difficult or impossible to find out Oswald's true motives. A key '63 Dallas prosecutor told me if he'd just had a few more days with Oswald, they would've got it out of him.
It was logical: a classic Mob rub-out of the killer before he could finger others. (Or so it seemed.) Dallas police had foolishly ignored J. Edgar Hoover's offer of FBI help to keep Oswald alive (after threats on his life), choosing to parade Oswald before TV cameras &amp; onlookers.
55 yrs ago today, when Jack Ruby killed Lee Oswald, the belief in conspiracy in John F. Kennedy's murder took flight.  My Dad and I were among millions watching as Ruby committed the first live TV murder. Dad exclaimed, "They just killed Oswald!" THEY, not he. @geraldposner

Document naming Trevor Fitzgerald is somewhat contradictory. Newly discovered #JFKFiles says MI-5 described Fitzgerald as “a capable reporter” but anonymous source said he had a habit of “shooting a line”.  "No other persons in the [Cambridge News] office” when the call came in.
"Call the American Embassy in London for some big news” was the tip to Cambridge News before JFK was shot in Dealey Plaza. But UK's MI-5 didn't report it to CIA until Nov. 23, 63.  Recent reports say Cambridge News had no record of who received the call. https://t.co/p6hRUIjnXd

Thousands and thousands of votes have been tossed all over the country for frivolous, and in many cases, faulty “reasons”. No one should support this—it’s not partisan and can hurt any side.
The point is, if a voter does his/her duty and casts a ballot (or files correctly for a ballot), it is fundamentally wrong to disallow the vote because of bureaucratic incompetence or a questionable, arbitrary judgment that a signature doesn’t match. (Age can change a signature.)
Once when I lived abroad, I made certain I jumped through all the hoops to get an absentee ballot. Virginia sent me a ballot all right—by surface mail. It arrived weeks after the election. Nothing will make a citizen more furious than being unfairly denied the right to vote.

With Sinema (D) now elected to Senate in Arizona, 2018 GOP gain is +1 seat. IF Scott (R) wins in Florida, +2. Not good for Dems but considering the map of seats up in ‘18, it could have been far worse for them.

Looking at my Dad’s WWII photos, many show death and destruction produced by fascism. But Dad occasionally found a way to express his sense of humor. A photo of a dog in France (June 1944) carried this caption: “Last living dog in France”. Surviving Nazi occupation was very hard.
A suggestion for veterans: Find time to write up or record your recollections of your service. Your descendants will treasure this. My most precious personal possession is my late Dad’s detailed itinerary with loads of photos of his four years in WWII service all through Europe.
Grateful to all veterans. In my own family, my Dad (WWII), and seven uncles served in WWII, Korea, and/orVietnam. 1 killed, 2 severely wounded. #VeteransDay

Florida, I believe, has had more very close (less than 2% margin) elections for President, Governor, and Senator than any other big state—maybe any state—in the last 30 years.
@Halma21 @SimAlex82 A lot bigger than any one person.
Senate: Joe Manchin (D) holds seat despite 42% Trump margin in 2016. Crystal Ball picked Manchin.
Senate: Marsha Blackburn (R) defeats Phil Bredesen (D) in TN. Crystal Ball not only picked Blackburn. We had TN in the R column consistently. It was a Tossup elsewhere. Always our view: Not enough Ds left in TN for a D victory.

Senate: Braun (R) defeats incumbent Donnelly (D). +1 for GOP in very R Indiana. Crystal Ball picked Braun to win.
VA-5 proves a bridge too far for Dems. Denver Riggleman (R) defeats Leslie Cockburn (D). Trump and Gillespie won the 5th, so this 2018 result makes sense. It’s a R hold.
And now VA provides the first D pickup of a R House seat tonight—Jennifer Wexton(D) over incumbent Barbara Comstock(R) by a sizable margin in NoVa’s 11th.

Two of the 3 have had all GOVs from 1 party for a long time. Last D GOV in SD elected in 1974. Last R GOV in OR elected 1982. KS record more mixed: Last D GOV elected in 2004. I'm NOT counting partial term GOVs who were never elected, just succeeded to office.
Everybody's asking about unforeseen upsets. The problem is, well, they're unforeseen. At least 3 GOV races are possibilities: Kansas, Oregon, South Dakota. Maybe D upsets in KS, SD and R upset in OR. All seem highly competitive.

One month from now, the "Trump-Kavanaugh Midterm" will conclude. The Kavanaugh confirmation can't really be called an October Surprise, but it will certainly have significant November effects in both directions. (And early voting in some form is already happening in many states.)

@sgorelick I'm sure the GOP will follow through and use the final 'no' vote to try to beat him in WV. It will be the best issue they'll have in a state that voted for Trump by 42%. And WV is very close to DC--lots of rallies.
@bperez1776 @Center4Politics I don't like choosing between awful and awful! Interesting, though: 1969 and 2018 featured the same 3.7% unemployment. A good economy does not guarantee social tranquility.
And now Manchin's office is saying that the vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination does not necessarily predict his actual vote on confirmation. So a hat tip to all of you who argued it this way. You were right--although Manchin's real confirmation vote will tell the tale.
@tridentjohn You never know, but somehow I doubt it. Manchin lit into Gov. Jim Justice when he switched from R to D. BUT again, you never know.
@cwonrails @wmlawman That's a great question. Manchin would much rather be the 51st vote, not the deciding vote!
@adamdkirsch Rs have multiple ways to control the Senate without winning Manchin's seat.
The assumption here, of course, is that Manchin's vote today is a tip-off of his final vote for Kavanaugh's confirmation. Maybe it isn't, but a switch would be a surprise.
Senior Republicans vowed to take Manchin out if he voted against Kavanaugh. It wasn't an idle threat in a state that voted for Trump by 42%.
It will be interesting to see how Trump/GOP treat Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) before Nov. 6. He's already leading, may have secured another term with his vote for Kavanaugh. They'll oppose him, of course, but this drains considerable energy from the effort to beat him.

@bperez1776 Let's wait and see what happens. This has been a roller coaster; I don't know what's around the next bend.
My 12th of Never Club has just admitted many of you as members. No dues or meetings. Just keep thinking up ideas that won’t ever happen. It’s fun! (“We dream things that never were and say, why not?”)
@roosterteacher I agree that 60 is YOUNG. Wisdom only comes at age 66. Next year, it will be 67.:)
@BWray_ @akaashkolluri Welcome to my 12th of never club. :)
@donciccio807 Poll says universe is "American voters" as opposed to all adults. I assume that means likely voters.
@lifesafeast Because each state has the right, under federalism and the Constitution, to determine its own judicial term rules. Great variation in the states.
@mel_huang I'm open. But life expectancy is lengthening (at least until the asteroid hits)...We'd have to keep raising it under your principle.
Some asking about the 18-year proposal. Fine with me, discussed in my "A More Perfect Constitution". In case of mid-term vacancies (deaths,etc), maybe do like 22nd Amendment for POTUS. More than half the term, no reappointment possible. Less than half the term, a full term is ok.
I can even argue that the Constitution doesn't provide for life tenure for SCOTUS justices. It merely says they serve "during good behavior". The swampy, mosquito-laden Potomac sent most justices packing after a few years. Five of 6 original justices served less than 10 years.
One way to lower the temperature of Supreme Court confirmation fights is to limit the justices' terms, lessening the stakes (a bit). I've long favored one 15-year term, nonrenewable. Enactment scheduled for the 12th of never.
On #Kavanaugh (and lots of other things), the gender gap has become a gender chasm. Women oppose confirmation (55-37%) while men favor (49-40%). [New Quinnipiac poll] Party affiliation &amp; race also matter greatly.

As of now, odds still favor GOP retaining control of Senate because of the one-sided nature of seats/states on the map. BUT Senate Ds are also benefiting from desire for Congress to check Trump. If Dems beat the odds in the Senate, we'll start our analysis with 'check' motive.
Heart of 2018 midterms: By 58%-27%, respondents want Congress to be more  of a check on Pres. Trump. New Quinnipiac poll also shows 14% generic  edge for Dems—well more than needed for a D House majority. Generic  average now=+8.4% D.

Easy solution to op-ed guessing game. Have each White House appointee tweet out a simple, “It wasn’t me!” Then see who didn’t. Because if there’s one thing we know about the Trump Administration, it’s that no one would ever lie.
I’ve long studied JFK’s “Profiles in Courage”. Zero chance the NYT op-ed “Resistance” writer would be featured in a new edition. The honored men stood up and were counted. They were not hidden in comfortable anonymity.
The guessing game to identify the NYT “Resistance” op-ed writer reminds me a bit of the 1996 search for Anonymous, author of “Primary Colors” (about a barely concealed Bill Clinton &amp; his affairs). Anonymous was Joe Klein, but everybody was accused before the unveiling.
@redtsunami1980 @kkondik Yes. Should be ready to go tomorrow.
Without knowing the identity of the author, this is hard to evaluate. Only the NYT knows the punch line. And the essay’s observations add little to what we already have heard.

Jon Kyl is a safe choice for Gov. Ducey, who himself is on the ballot in Nov. But Kyl's a placeholder appointee (and a guaranteed R leadership vote on most everything). Open seat battle in 2020 means Dems will have another Senate target in a presidential year. https://t.co/WuVD9BMQrb

As has been obvious all along, Gwen Graham is very likely the D FL GOV nominee. As her successful race is analyzed, don't omit wise daily advice she received from her Dad, ex-Gov/Sen Bob Graham. No living person knows more about FL politics, or has been more successful. #FLVotes

Whether Kevin Nicholson wins or loses the GOP Senate nod in WI (right now he's losing), the Nicholson family (part of it) will rejoice. Both his parents and his brother endorsed and gave money to Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI). Separate Thanksgivings guaranteed.
Toss-up is the logical rating now, but after Walker's victories in 2 prior GOV runs plus a tough recall election, no one should count him out.

Maybe they won't. https://t.co/TSLXGZGUIP
There's a good reason Corey Stewart is staying very hard line in this debate with Tim Kaine. So far Stewart hasn't come close to solidifying even the 45% who voted for Trump in VA. He must do that before he can try to appeal beyond the Trump base, if that's even possible.
Corey Stewart, who campaigned for Senate candidate Roy Moore in AL, won't renounce him, defends him on the underage girls charges. Well, there's a Kaine TV ad in the fall.

UNITY AT LAST. Just-released Ipsos study of over 600,000 tweets sent today on #TrumpPutinSummit shows they are overwhelmingly negative--and negative in all 50 states. 10,000+ Reddit comments also heavily negative, from conservatives as well as liberals. https://t.co/gARn2uS9QM
Rare case, special man: A friend of mine, the late Jerry ter Horst (President Ford's first press secretary) gave up all the White House prestige and perks just a month into Ford's presidency. The Nixon pardon was too much for him.
Ah, Washington is waiting again for resignations of conscience from the Trump administration. At this very moment, a Trump appointee is wrestling with his conscience. He'll win.

The reporter was @JonLemire of the Associated Press. Patriots salute you.
Thanks to the reporter who asked the key question—Mr. Trump, do you believe US intelligence, or do you believe Putin? Not that we got an answer—which was actually an answer.
Trump takes every mention of Russian meddling as an attack on his victory. You can separate the two—and a POTUS doing his job should. Do you agree with the collective judgment of US intelligence agencies—or do you believe Putin? It’s one or the other!
Attention: journalists sitting in the Trump-Putin press conference... https://t.co/KQHJJbZkzq
Putin just lied that Russia didn’t interfere in U.S. elections and won’t in the future. So if Trump even raised the issue in a serious way, he had no impact.
Putin declares the summit a “success”. Looking into the Crystal Ball, I see Pres. Trump in just a few minutes declaring the summit a “tremendous success” and perhaps “the most successful summit in the history of the universe.”

Shame on you for calling President Trump “The Ugly American” while he travels abroad. You’ve forgotten the plot of that 1958 novel. The fictional Ugly American was the hero, not the villain.
Democratic energy/anger is proving to be a key part of the 2018 story. But so is a quieter factor: the need for an institutional check on Donald Trump. Every time POTUS creates chaos or embarrassment at home or abroad, chances of a D House takeover increase.

Two reasons why Trump is (very) likely to get his Suprene Court pick, whoever it is. (1) 2014–when Dems lost the Senate; (2) 2016–when Dems lost the White House &amp; failed to regain the Senate. Obvious, oft-heard conclusion: Elections matter. Vote even when you’re not “excited”.

Incidentally, Jackie's newly found notes end a small controversy about the suit. A woman reporter on the Dallas trip told male colleagues early on 11/22, "It's a suit, not a dress, and it's raspberry, not pink. Mrs. Kennedy would never wear pink." Except Jackie writes "pink" here
Many have asked about the blood-soaked pink Chanel suit Mrs. Kennedy wore on 11/22/63. It's in storage, won't be seen again until at least 2103. (Last I heard, the pillbox hat could not be found.) I'm for transparency but not satisfying morbid curiosity. https://t.co/ywvd2j7dp0

This is just a guess, but I'll bet the Senate will not want to dally this time (as with Merrick Garland). Very, very urgent to fill the Kennedy seat immediately. Yep, just a guess. #SCOTUS
ANTHONY KENNEDY RETIRING. It's #Armageddon, folks. If Trump fills this seat, as is likely, conservative Republicans will control everything at the federal level--and the Supreme Court itself for a long time to come.
Why does the press print party labels for politicians? It’s a cue to readers so they can put each pol in context. Increasingly the same logic applies to Justices on the Roberts Court.
I’m only half-serious about party labels for Justices but very frequently they vote on the Court as they likely do on Election Day. Maybe a Justice who zigs and zags can earn an (I) for Independent. (O’Connor or Kennedy perhaps)
This Supreme Court is as partisanly polarized as the Congress. I propose each current Justice be identified with (R) or (D) whenever their name is mentioned. Truth in advertising!
Mitt Romney has all but won UT's Senate seat. But which Romney will show up in Jan.? The Romney who passionately critiqued Trump in spring '16, or the one who crawled to Trump after the election to try to become Secretary of State? Probably both, depending on the day and issue.

What's the 30,000-foot import of the Supreme Court 5-4 stamp of approval for Trump's Muslim ban (version 3)? The only reliable checks on a POTUS in our system are produced by elections. Even Justices come indirectly from elections. Voters have a chance to check, or not, in Nov.

And already I’m getting messages from Dem optimists saying they’ll pick up 4 or 5 House seats in VA. OK, if you say so, but I doubt it. Five months to go.
VA Republicans now have a big problem. If the race goes as expected—IF—and Kaine wins handily, the undertow for the GOP could produce 2 or 3 gains for Ds in House seats. That’s a real one-state contribution to the +23 seats (net) Dems need nationally.
Sen. Tim Kaine is considered a heavy favorite against the very Trumpian Corey Stewart. But if there’s a candidate in the country who won’t be overconfident, it’s Hillary Clinton’s VP nominee. Bitter lesson learned in 2016.
As expected, Corey Stewart has won the GOP Senate nomination in Virginia to oppose Sen. Tim Kaine (D). Close win, a reverse of his close loss for Governor (R) in 2017.
I recall meeting Del. Eleanor Sheppard (D)of Richmond in the 1960s—the ONLY woman in the House of Delegates. And the Senate of Virginia? NO women at all.
Virginia has come a long way since the ERA was defeated repeatedly in the 1970s on. If Democrats take over the U.S. House in November, the flip will be built on a solid majority of women’s votes—and women candidates. https://t.co/vNY3OpdQ9p

Today marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Robert Kennedy, a seminal moment in a terrible year.  The @Center4Politics remembers the tragedy in our documentary “Ball of Confusion” available FREE here:  https://t.co/BO1NaMD6gx
Bobby Kennedy was just 42 years old when assassinated. JFK was 46. MLK was 39. Too sad for words. #RFK50
Before the day’s bits of new history overtake us, a moment please to reflect on Robert F. Kennedy’s life, ended by assassin’s bullets 50 years ago today after he won the California primary. In an awful year he gave hope to millions—hope that died with him. #RFK50
“Should JFK have resigned?” asks Bill Clinton. If his affairs had become known, given the standards of the time, he would have had to. Not to defend JFK’s many indiscretions, but private life was off limits for media then. Not so by the ‘90s, so Clinton was the more reckless.
Even for President Trump, a self-pardon is outlandish and a political nonstarter. He would lose some portion of his own supporters, plus Democrats and most Independents/third party backers would be united in opposition.

One another note: @UVA 's College Republican leaders turned out in force today to support Denver Riggelman. In my experience, young Rs are heavily libertarian, at least on some social issues.
Here's a sentiment I've heard supported a lot today: These small, often-ideological party committees should not be vested with this kind of power. Better to have a special primary or convention. #VA05
Yet, there are bound to be repercussions on the right for Riggelman.  VA05 has a large population of conservative evangelicals. Will they back a libertarian R?
The real headline, besides Riggelman winning, is how Dunbar came so close. She would have turned VA05 into Toss Up, or even in time, Leans D.

Dunbar just lost the GOP nomination in VA06. She doesn’t live in VA05. She was considered one of the most conservative R officials ever in Texas. Yes, Texas. She wanted Jefferson shunned because he advocated separation of church &amp; state. VA05 is home to TJ’s UVA &amp; Monticello. https://t.co/7OP9uG3aEx
Friends, if you want to see a microcosm of what has happened to the GOP, look no further than VA05.

Virginia GOP officials pushed Garrett out. Nationals knew about problems (more than alcoholism), but left it to state Rs. Messy—but also deftly handled. They’re all worried about who ends up on ballot—conservative mainstream or not?
Two leading candidates to replace Garrett are state Sen. Bill Stanley and Del. Rob Bell. More people are making noises. Fifth District GOP committee will pick the substitute before June 12 deadline. Short campaign!

The fight will go on in 2021, if not earlier, but real progress has been made. Let’s see how extensive the redactions are...But thanks to all at NARA, as well as advocates of transparency in other quarters. Credit due POTUS for approving release of the bulk of #JFKfiles.
Note: There are thousands of documents not included in NARA releases because they were deemed “not relevant” to the JFK assassination in the 1990s. Some dispute the “not relevant” designation and want all those files released too.
My team will start excavating. It takes a long time. We are still working on some key documents from last year’s releases. Little instant gratification for those who will ask this afternoon, “what’s in there?” Will occasionally post docs that intrigue.
#JFKfiles National Archives just released 19,045 files, says no more remain to be released under terms of 1992 law BUT there are still redactions in some documents. These will be reviewed again for possible release by 10/26/21.

With respect to those of you claiming columnist Mike Royko coined the "Moonbeam" label, in fact Royko took it from a 1978 Rolling Stone interview with Linda Ronstadt. SHE coined the term for her boyfriend, "little Moonbeam".
Trump is showing his age. "Moonbeam" is occasionally employed, but it hasn't been widely used as Jerry Brown's nickname in decades. Brown's girlfriend, singer Linda Ronstadt, affectionately gave him the moniker in 1978--40 years ago during Brown's 1st (of 4) terms as GOV.
One footnote: Pres. William Howard Taft (R) did not appear on the Calif. ballot in 1912, incredibly. Teddy Roosevelt (R-Progressive) defeated Woodrow Wilson (D) by a handful of votes. Taft was just a write-in, got only scattered votes.
Worth remembering that Trump received 31.6% of the vote in California--the lowest % ever recorded for a Republican nominee for President in the Golden State. No love lost ever. Trump can California-bash without Electoral College consequences. https://t.co/pmyTZIiHjj

This poll had the same old party breakdown we’ve come to expect: Close to 9 of 10 Rs expect Trump to win again, versus 9 of 10 Ds who think he’ll lose—duplicating the party voting results from Trump-Clinton in 2016.
If the 54-40% prediction of Trump defeat in 2020 reveals anything, it’s that few people have changed sides. 2016 vote was 46% Trump, 54% others. The re-elect numbers reflect Trump’s unpopularity now. They probably say more about the Nov 2018 outcome than the one in Nov 2020.
New poll (CNN) has respondents predicting, by 54-40%, Trump will lose reelection in 2020. In their 2nd years, Reagan, Clinton, &amp; Obama were thought to be likely losers for reelection. And GHWBush was seen likely to win again. Nobody has a clue about 2020 at this early point.

Speaking of scratching off, Hawaii Gov. Ige looks like a goner in the D primary. US Rep. Colleen Hanabusa is up 20%. Ige wasn’t popular before the false nuclear bomb alert, but the fallout has likely finished him off. Will probably be 2nd consecutive D one-termer.
Remember when Mark Zuckerberg was semi-seriously included in those long lists of 2020 presidential possibilities? You can safely scratch him off.
Daniels said she didn't report it to the police. Maybe. But most people who were threatened in that fashion would (should) have reported it. Not saying her charge is false--I can believe anything at this point. But if true, she must have told friends/family. Can they back her up?
So one of the surprises in the #60Minutes Stormy Daniels interview is an allegation that a Trump-sponsored thug threatened her (and daughter) with physical harm in Las Vegas in 2011. Did she report it to police? Are there contemporaneous witnesses?

#IllinoisPrimary turnout is another indicator of D enthusiasm. Of course, IL is a Blue state in a Blue year but the turnout gap between Rs and Ds is huge. Plus, Gov. Rauner (R-IL) is far less popular than the R GOVs in MA, MD, VT--early favorites for reelection in Nov. https://t.co/rwsbkDC2Cw
So in #ILGov, the likely match-up is JB Pritzker(D) vs. Gov. Bruce Rauner(R). You can argue how much the race tilts D, but it surely tilts D for Nov. Had Ives been the R nominee, you could've just put a "win" checkmark next to Pritzker right now.

There may not be a clear winner tonight in #PA18. Certainly not before some of us go to bed. Winning matters for retirements, recruiting, fundraising. But this special is about more than that. Trump's margin of 20% in 2016 has dwindled to, oh, about 0%. For now, that's the story.

When you woke up this morning, could you have imagined that PA-18 would be the SECOND most important political story of the day?
Firing by Twitter. A new reason to check your Twitter feed early each day.
Twitter has shortened tweets again. Surely that's the explanation for Nikki Haley's failure to thank and salute Rex Tillerson. https://t.co/L4Vxg3VETn
Rex Tillerson was a boy scout--and former head of the Scouts. Donald Trump? Even his fans wouldn't call him a boy scout (read that oath). This was not a match made in heaven.
What a story--no, stories--Tillerson has to tell. Problem is, I'm not sure he'll ever tell.

Last night’s Trump rally proved again that vulgar antics thrill his base. The office hasn’t made the man; instead, Trump has re-made the office, lowering standards of acceptable presidential behavior so far that it will take great efforts by his successors to repair the damage.
Under the law, you need an official vehicle to sponsor your slogan. I'd suggest Committee to Re-Elect the President (CREEP). Hasn't been used in decades. #KeepAmericaGreat
Never choose a slogan that can be easily parodied. #KAG is too close to #GAG. (Ex: Goldwater in '64: "In your heart you know he's right." Within 5 mins, Dems had turned that into, "In your guts you know he's nuts.")

JFK consulted Eisenhower quite a bit. Some POTUS rivals eventually became good friends, such as Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, or Bill Clinton and GHW Bush. Just a wild guess, but we can probably rule that out for Trump and...well, all his living predecessors.
I believe the last time a POTUS refused to make even courtesy calls to his predecessor was FDR, who gave the cold shoulder to Herbert Hoover. But Harry Truman made up for it, treating Hoover with respect.

Cold, hard realism from #JFKfiles: Many foreign nations, leaders, and groups calculated their reaction to the assassination to serve their needs and propaganda interests—including speculation about who killed JFK and why. Same for their sizing up of LBJ, &amp; how they could benefit.

Also noted:  “Oswald saw a movie on TV about an attempted presidential assassination with a rifle shortly before his deed, which could have sparked him into action.” #JFKfiles
CIA memo ponders Oswald’s motivation. Rejects suggestion to study LHO handwriting. Officer concludes that LHO’s motivation is largely explained by "his neurotic background...failure to achieve status &amp;...very deep resentment to all authority.” https://t.co/PxCuzJXptN  #JFKfiles

Chauffeur for Soviet Embassy in Australia informs US as early as Oct. 15, 1962 of alleged plot by Soviets to assassination JFK.  Second call by same person year later following assassination offers additional theories: https://t.co/N14Q7sqD8x  #JKFKfiles
Tragically, I believe this to be true. In those days, almost everyone appeared to be oblivious to reality.

Trump is 1st POTUS since Watergate-burdened Nixon in 1973 not to campaign for his party’s VA GOV nominee. Mills Godwin(R) won anyway.

Just as candidates should be criticized for bad behavior, they should be applauded for good. Let's be glad the debates weren't food fights.
This is a comment on the 3 low-key &amp; respectful debates Northam and Gillespie have had. I'm not endorsing over-the-line TV ads or mailers.
I wonder if we will ever see a White House campaign as genteel and civil as this #VAGOV matchup? Hint: No.
Gun control. I think you can guess where they stand. #VAGOV
Sanctuary cities and immigration and MS-13 and long-acting contraceptives. It’ll all be in the news reports. I’m not Cliff’s Notes. #VAGOV
We are back to sheriffs again. The give and take was stimulating. Attn Sheriffs: I’ll be happy to meet with you at your convenience. #VAGOV
Which program will you eliminate if elected? Whew. Neither one picked the @UVA @Center4Politics . #VAGOV
I’m not a MD, but my lay opinion is that neither Northam nor Gillespie is likely to have a heart attack or stroke. #VAGOV
Who showed up? First mutual attack. Northam missed meetings as LG. Northam says Gillespie only shows up for paying clients. No voices raised
As expected, lots of rural issues being discussed. Lots. Again, it’s the SW VA debate. #VAGOV
Ah, we get a pork chop! It’s VA Sheriff’s Assn. meeting cancelled by Gov.McAuliffe. But no exchange b/c Northam isn’t given time to respond.
They are both clearly opposed to opioid addiction. #VAGOV
Northam stresses nonpartisan redistricting and says Gillespie invented it. Gillespie blames MA GOV Gerry. Long dead, Gerry left a sad legacy
Northam so far is avoiding mention of or attacks on Trump, who is quite unpopular in VA as a whole but beloved in SW.
First mention of Obama by Gillespie in a very anti-Obama coal region. #VAGOV
No one can say these two aren’t policy oriented—and relatively mild-mannered. #VAGOV
And they’re off! Audience seems substantially R, reflecting this SW region. Lots of R public officials here.#VAGOV

VA GOV: Here are some just-released numbers that matter (as opposed to WaPo polling). Northam raised $6.4m in Sept, has $5.7m on hand.

Spring GOV primaries 2017: WaPo-Schar had Perriello up 2 and Gillespie up 20. Northam beat Perriello by 12 and Gillespie won by just 1%.
In 2013 WaPo poll had McAuliffe up 12 toward the end of fall campaign. He won by ~2.5%.
New WaPo poll on VA GOV has Northam over Gillespie by 53-40 (likely voters). Much bigger than recent private D polls. Skepticism warranted.

No legal distinction between a state and a Commonwealth(only VA,MA,PA,KY). But as Wm Faulkner said, "All Virginians are snobs." Matters here
I've watched every VA GOV debate since 1981 start. Never have 2 nominees been so respectful. They barely raised their voices. #VaGovDebate
Debates are better without a panel. Let moderator be timekeeper. Let candidates debate themselves directly. Happening in AL SEN #VaGovDebate
So who won? All Rs think Gillespie did. All Ds think Northam did. Polarized era. But these 2 are very civil. Never got nasty.#VaGovDebate
@johnmtaylor @ComfortablySmug I have no excuse for binge-debating because I don't drink.
If nothing else, anyone watching this debate will realize that VA is a Commonwealth rather than a mere state. :) #VaGovDebate
Asked if he wants Trump to rally for him, Gillespie says he'll welcome help from "anybody". POTUS won't like being 'anybody'.#VaGovDebate
