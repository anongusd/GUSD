(5)call ur members of Congress:OPPOSE #ForcedArbitration &amp; OPPOSE Cgrs attmpts to rollback #CFPB cnsmr prtxn rules! #SubDCCP #equifaxbreach
&gt;(4),to Green's point,not time to rollback #CFPB rule limitng forced arb in financl agrmts like in #Equifaxbreach &amp; other products they have
which brings to (3) makes clear forced arb NOT how you make cnsmrs whole-esp not when consumers have no choice but to submit #Equifaxbreach
(2) Need to figure out how to make injured consmrs whole in cases like #Equifaxbreach w SSN etc where harm isnt nec solved w/$or PW change..
(1) #EquifaxBreach may have been worst SO FAR, but unlikely to be the last. Need accountability to incentivize bttr care for cnsmr data
