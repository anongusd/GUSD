That’s why he likes his dictators. Trump is a very cunning con man from New York who wanted to have his Trump Tower in Moscow and in order to accomplish that he needed to ingratiate himself to Putin. He will receive “honorary” Russian citizenship ...
... the only way he can ingratiate himself to Putin is in his secret meetings with him ( secret to us and our intelligence services, not to Russians). Tins fits perfectly well with his personality disorder. He values only people who are at his level of importance.

8/8 Re-watching your angry outburst on TV... you would do yourself, your family, and your country a lot of good if you withdrew from the process and announced that you will seek professional assessment of your potential alcoholism. #KavanaughConfirmationHearings
7/8 Instead, your daughters when they grow up and experience life a bit, will be #KavanaughConfirmationHearings
6/8 apologize to Dr. Ford and to any other woman you might have offended against. You would have come across as a man who wants to atone for any transgressions you might have committed against anyone.#KavanaughConfirmationHearings
5/8 Dr. Ford because of your alcohol consumption at young age, and that those events could have taken place. And if they did you profoundly #KavanaughConfirmationHearings
4/8 you could have been more introspective and told the committee the truth... that you don’t have any recollection of the events described by #KavanaughConfirmationHearings
3/8 chosen beer with Judge over seduction ritual which would require more than getting smashed. Instead of insulting Senate’s democrats, instead of screaming about Clinton’s revenge and suggesting that millions of dollars are being spent against you #KavanaughConfirmationHearings
2/8 You don’t remember her b/c there were too many of those incidents. You were not able to negotiate any sexual encounters on a voluntary, consensual basis, because you have already #KavanaughConfirmationHearings
@Judge_Kavanaugh 1/8 By now you should have realized that you suffer from alcoholism, untreated and denied by you. You have no memory of the incident from 36 years ago because it was not of consequence to you. You were already drunk when she got there. #KavanaughConfirmation

@realDonaldTrump So now Russia orders us around in Syria, telling our troops what to do. Apparently this loving relationship you have with your master Vladimir Putin is not doing us any good.
I think this... DJT got together with one of his cohorts and set up NYT for this anon op-ed. It contains no new info. The only purpose it serves is agitation of DJT’s base. It’s his doing for his own benefit. Remember Barron? And his praise of Trump? I bet it’s DJT.

He will be known in human history of an opportunist who ran for president to increase his name’s profile, without expecting to win, only to discover that he won electoral college vote and had to show qualities of character he never had.
Donald J Trump will become a symbol of rudeness, pettiness, stupidity, ignorance, racism, avarice and greed.
All future elections will start with a question “do you really want to end up with a president like Trump?”

@Tschudi_Davai I must have stepped into somebody else’s conversation... all I noticed is your comment on “thousands years” whereas in the best case scenario we are talking about one thousand years, with long interruptions, and really about six, maximum seven centuries of the rise of Russia.
Otherwise, Russia will always remain a local, regional power with inferiority complex, trying to make up for it by abusing its neighbors.
Finally, if Russian people want to be recognized for all their “achievements” they have to start with removing their criminal government and start demanding free elections and punishment for criminals who stole Russians’ future from them. There, you have it. Have a nice weekend
If it wasn’t for American land-lease Stalin would lose the war against Hitler. BTW USSR never called that war “world war” it was always “war to defend homeland”.
You can attribute Russian suffering in WWII to Joseph Stalin’s pact with Hitler to partition Poland and making it easier for him to attack USSR later. “Life”, “women’s rights”, “society” - you must be kidding. Russian literature reflecting misery of Russian life, maybe.
Dear Ivan, don’t feel slighted. People who know Russian history also know how much Russians, Ukrainians, Tartars, Lithuanians, Latvians, Georgians, Estonians, Poles, Czechoslovaks, Romanians, Hungarians, Bulgarians, suffered under different Russian regimes. https://t.co/FQ1ZU0MSOe
@Tschudi_Davai No person is condemning Russian people. They have zero voice in their government actions, they have never lived for any significant time as people who rely on self rule, hence the blind support of Putin and desire for “greatness of Russia”. Otherwise they are great guys.
@Tschudi_Davai Yes I am very familiar with the history of Russian people, Russian state, and its imperial ambition and Russian people helplessness in the face of dictators that ruled Russia for hundreds of years. It is obvious to me that you are ignorant of the same, hence “thousands of years”

No harm voting local reps from 3rd party, or even Congressional rep, but in presidential election the choice is limited to two top dogs. You give up your power to choose if you vote for 3rd party president.
That’s right, “winner takes all” rule and electoral college consisting of a number of delegates from each state equal to Congressional representation for each state is voting for the president and vice president. No 3rd party presidential candidate had ever had a chance. https://t.co/kgaFDf4Xys
