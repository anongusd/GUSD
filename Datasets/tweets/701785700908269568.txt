And I hold a couple people responsible for making me see myself where I am and where i need to be. So thank you @SoProper and @MichelleObama.
Not just for myself either. But for my friends, family, and one day the man who will be my husband. I’m getting up to the standards of the man I have perceived myself to be. And I will be there. It only takes one bolt of lighting to the ass to grow you up.
I’m learning that right now because what was perceived at the time and what my perception was at the time has come back to hit me harder than anything I’ve ever experienced in my entire life. But it’s also provided me with mental clarity and reflection to be who I need to be.
If I’ve learned nothing in the last few months. Perception, no matter right or wrong at the time. Does indeed become reality. How you handle the outcome and how you fix the problem shows who you truly are or will become. #SelfReflection
