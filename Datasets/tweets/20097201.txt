Cohen says he discussed the possibility of a payment to Stormy Daniels with Trump "each and every time" it came up in 2016 and when the decision was made to make the payment, days before the election, Cohen met in Trump's office with Trump and Trump Org CFO Allen Weisselberg.
"The discussions regarding the reimbursement occurred long before he became president," Cohen says of Trump.
Cohen: "As of yesterday, I am no longer a lawyer."		Here's my story on Cohen's disbarment: https://t.co/wiFJSYHtYg
Cohen wraps up: 		"I am not a perfect man. I have done things I am not proud of, and I will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life."
Michael Cohen: "I have never asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon from President Trump."
Cohen: "Mr. Trump had frequently told me and others that his son Don Jr. had the worst judgment of anyone in the world."
"I recall Don Jr. leaning over to this father and speaking in a low voice, which I could clearly hear, and saying: 'The meeting is all set.'	I remember Mr. Trump saying, 'OK good. Let me know.'"
Cohen:		"He finished the conversation with the following comment: 'You think I'm stupid? I'm not going to Vietnam.'		"I find it ironic, Mr. Trump, that you are in Vietnam right now."
Cohen says that when he visited the Oval Office in 2017, Trump told him "Don't worry, Michael, your January and February reimbursement checks are coming."		Per Cohen, those were checks to reimburse Cohen for the the illegal payment Cohen made to Stormy Daniels.
Cohen refers to "Mr. Trump's TV lawyer."
"I am going to jail in part because of my decision to help Mr. Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later."
Cohen: "He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair, and to lie about it to his wife about it, which I did. Lying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets because she is a kind, good person. And I respect her greatly and she did not deserve that."
The former personal attorney to the President of the United States:		"He once told me that black people would never vote or him because they were too stupid."
Cohen: "He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn't a 'shithole.' This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States."
Cohen:		"A lot of people have asked me about whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of time. The answer is yes."
"Lying for Mr. Trump was normalized, and no one around him questioned it. In fairness, no one around him today questions it, either."
"Being around Mr. Trump was intoxicating."
Cohen:		"Last fall I pled guilty in federal court to felonies for the benefit of, at the direction of, and in coordination with Individual #1.		For the record: Individual #1 is President Donald J. Trump."
Cohen is choking up when speaking about his family.
"You need to know that Mr. Trump's personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it."		Cohen is convicted of false statements to Congress for this statement.
Cohen: "At the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there's no Russian business, and then go on and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie."
RT @SaraMurray: Here are the documents Cohen is sharing to back up his testimony today:		https://t.co/FjEtjEuzyt

From the judge during Michael Cohen's sentencing today: "Our system of justice would be less robust without the use of cooperating witnesses to assist law enforcement."
Michael Cohen was sentenced Wednesday to three years in prison for crimes that included paying to silence women who claimed affairs with Trump after the president's onetime "fixer" attributed his offenses to "my duty to cover up his dirty deeds." https://t.co/unBhUexeiZ
The lawyer for the president is going to prison for crimes that were committed to help him win office.
SDNY says it reached a non-prosecution agreement with AMI, the National Enquirer's parent company, "in connection with AMI‚Äôs role in making the above-described $150,000 payment before the 2016 presidential election."		The agreement is dated Sept. 21, 2018. https://t.co/YZIBe0LncY

Cohen was silent for a few moments. He just sniffled.
Cohen: "This may	seem hard to believe but today is one of the most meaningful days of my life. I have been living in a personal and mental incarceration ever since the day that I accepted	the offer to work for a real estate mogul whose business acumen that I deeply admired."
Cohen: "I take full responsibility for each act that i pled guilty to: the personal ones to me and those invovlivng the president of the united states of america."
Michael Cohen is about to address the court.
Roos said of the hush money payments: "In committing these crimes, Mr. Cohen has eroded faith in the electoral process and compromised the rule of law."
Roos: "For all the hypothesizing that Mr. Petrillo has done, Mr. Cohen can‚Äôt have it both ways. There is a standard way this office conducts cooperation...we‚Äôve treated Mr. Cohen just the way we treat every other defendant that deal with the US Attorney's office."
Rhee spoke for only a minute or two. She summarized what was in their memo and said Cohen "has told the truth."		Nicholas Roos from SDNY just began speaking.
Jeannie Rhee is now speaking on behalf of the special counsel.
Petrillo took a serious dig at the Southern District. "Power	to the southern district. They want to make a bigger case than they‚Äôve already made. And maybe there‚Äôs a little pride involved here in not being at the center of attention."
Petrillo says Cohen wants to cooperate but that "he‚Äôs	wary of a long-term cooperation agreement for personal reasons and because he wants both to remove himself and remove his family from the glare of the cameras."
Arguing that Cohen has been treated unlike other defendants, Petrillo suggests that was because "Mr. Cohen had the misfortune to have been counsel to the president."
Petrillo says he will say little about the campaign-finance charges but notes a letter that was submitted by an attorney with the sentencing memo that said the attorney had "seen many attorneys succumb to the wishes of a particularly persuasive client."
Petrillo: "No bank has ever lost money dealing with Michael Cohen. I‚Äôll say that again: No bank has ever lost money dealing with Michael Cohen. No friend in need has ever been turned away."
Petrillo is now addressing what he describes as Cohen's good deeds. "This is a man whose first instinct is to help."
Petrillo: "His action stands in profound contrast to the decision of some others not to cooperate and allegedly to double deal while pretending to cooperate."
Petrillo says Cohen "came forward to offer evidence against the most powerful person in our country." 		"The SCO's investigation is of utmost national significance, no less than seen 40 years ago in Watergate," Petrillo says.
Petrillo says that when Cohen came forward to help the investigation, "He knew the president might shut down the investigation."
Guy Petrillo is speaking on behalf of Michael Cohen. He says Cohen's mother and father, his inlaws, his wife, kids and a cousin are there to support Cohen.

And another:		"The sentence imposed should reflect the seriousness of Cohen's brazen violations of the election laws and attempt to counter the public cynicism that may arise when individuals like Cohen act as if the political process belongs to the rich and powerful."
Another striking line from SDNY on Michael Cohen: 		"His offenses strike at several pillars of our society and system of government: the payment of taxes; transparent and fair elections; and truthfulness before government and in business."
SDNY's memo is brutal.
SDNY says no 5K1 motion is being made by them or special counsel because "Cohen repeatedly declined to provide full information about the scope of any additional criminal conduct in which he may have engaged or had knowledge."
There are no redactions in either of these filings.

Special counsel Robert Mueller‚Äôs office has filed its sentencing memo for Michael Cohen.
Key graf from SDNY sentencing memo: https://t.co/zD52Qa3v4X
SDNY: "To be clear: Cohen does not have a cooperation agreement and is not receiving a Section 5K1.1 letter either from this Office or the SCO, and therefore is not properly described as a 'cooperating witness,' as that term is commonly used in this District."
SDNY says Cohen ‚Äúdid provide information to law enforcement, including information that assisted the Special Counsel‚Äôs Office in ongoing matters,‚Äù but prosecutors add that ‚ÄúCohen‚Äôs description of those efforts is overstated in some respects and incomplete in others.‚Äù
SDNY is asking for a ‚Äúa substantial term of imprisonment" for Michael Cohen.		The guidelines from his plea agreement call for a prison term of between 46 and 63 months.

SDNY US Attorney Geoff Berman:		"The defendant's conduct, as charged, is cowardly and reprehensible and totally anathema to our democracy."
FBI Director Chris Wray:		"These are not hoax devices."

"I don't know the full extent of the situation, but President Trump mentioned this issue and I will look into it," Putin says of the 12 Russian military officers charged by Mueller.

Do you hold Russia at all accountable for anything in particular?		Trump: "Yes, I do. I hold both countries responsible. I hold the United States accountable...I think we're all to blame."
"The word 'competitor' is a compliment," Trump says of his description of Putin.
"I'm sure we'll be meeting again in the future -- often," Trump says of Putin.

@zackwhittaker Yeah although this material wasn‚Äôt necessarily from BlackBerries. Many devices were seized from Cohen, including an iPad, etc. The top bullet point in the filing indicates they‚Äôre talking about BlackBerries, but the one regarding the encrypted apps doesn‚Äôt.
There are more than a few people interested in how law enforcement obtained info from encrypted messaging apps! In Manafort, it was via the recipient and iCloud. In this case, the filing doesn‚Äôt indicate. https://t.co/s68gcvWrZx
SDNY says in filing that it has recovered 16 pages of material produced from Michael Cohen's shredder. 	It has also obtained 731 pages of messages and call logs from encrypted apps. https://t.co/XII8J2w45D https://t.co/lLtvZ1nxXu
