We must be willing to combat hate of all kinds while also calling out oppression of all kinds. I will do my best to live up to that. I hope my colleagues will join me in doing the same.
Being opposed to Netanyahu and the occupation is not the same as being anti-Semitic. I am grateful to the many Jewish allies who have spoken out and said the same.
People do every single day, and no I haven’t attached pro-Isreal Americans. I have questioned our politics! You want to paint every word I say as such, and that’s more of your problem. https://t.co/KxhRlfYRfq
@Stpolishook I have not said anything about the loyalty of others, but spoke about the loyalty expected of me. There is the difference.
I am in the Horn of Africa this weekend, proud to see peace prosper here and to be part of the first American delegation to Eritrea🇪🇷 in decades is one I am grateful for. I fight peace and justice because only those who experience the pain of war, know the joy of peace. ✊🏽
My Americanness is questioned by the President and the @GOP on a daily basis, yet my colleagues remain silent. I know what it means to be American and no one will ever tell me otherwise.
I am told everyday that I am anti-American if I am not pro-Israel. I find that to be problematic and I am not alone. I just happen to be willing to speak up on it and open myself to attacks.
I have not mischaracterized our relationship with Israel, I have questioned it and that has been clear from my end.

Millions of workers in the U.S. are struggling just to put food on the table, while McDonald’s CEO makes $21.8 million a year. That’s just wrong.	 	We need to #RaisetheWage so that no one is the richest country on earth lives in poverty. ✊🏽
And CEO @steveeasterbrook isn’t an outlier. Since 1978, CEO's have seen a 937% increase in earnings.	 	Workers have have only received an 11.2% increase. https://t.co/ELgtlQuVcO
In fact, just *10 percent* of McDonald’s workers in the U.S. make a living wage. https://t.co/kGqUS3h0zM
For context, the living wage in the United States was $16.07 in 2017, almost double the average wages of McDonald's fast food workers. 	https://t.co/GygYlpPyCp
So how much do they pay?	 	Per Payscale data (which the Post cites), McDonalds pays $8.31/hr for a “fast food worker.”		That’s $17,285 for a full-time worker who takes no time off—a poverty wage. https://t.co/kGzFvURJjE
Now let’s look at how McDonald's treats its U.S. workers. 	 	In 2015, the company promised to pay workers at least $1 above the local minimum wage. According to their own employees, they broke that promise. https://t.co/tfTgSIBvVH
Let’s dig into why that is. The CEO-to-worker pay gap at McDonald’s is 3,101 to 1 globally—the largest of any company surveyed.	 	As I noted in committee, McDonald’s CEO earns $21.8 million *per year*.	 	The median worker worldwide earns just $7,017. https://t.co/RcIJX3UHTw

There are many narratives of who and what I am, designed to demonize and vilify me.		It’s being building since my early days as an organizer. A concussion didn’t deter me and smears certainly won’t . I fought for my seat at the  table &amp; will use it to fight a more peaceful world!
It is important that when you see oppression taking place - when you see our values being attacked as humans - you stand up, and it doesn't matter who the inhabitors of that particular region might be. 		Whether it is your father, your brother or your sister, you speak up.
As a survivor of war, the acts of war justified or not will always be acts of evil to me.		Like #MLK90, I unapologetically believe “Mankind must put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind."
With that said, it is important to distinguish between criticizing a military action by a government and attacking a particular people of faith.		I will not shy away of criticism of any government when I see injustice —whether it be Saudi Arabia, Somalia, even our own government!
That statement came in the context of the Gaza War.		It’s now apparent to me that I spent lots of energy putting my 2012 tweet in context and little energy is disavowing the anti-semitic trope I unknowingly used, which is unfortunate and offensive.
Hi @bariweiss, 		You are correct when you say, 		“Perhaps Ms. Omar is sincerely befuddled and not simply deflecting” 		In all sincerity, it was after my CNN interview that I heard from Jewish orgs. that my use of the word “Hypnotize” and the ugly sentiment it holds was offensive. https://t.co/IxPScaSzGw

In Minnesota, more than 6,000 workers are affected by the shutdown, including over 1,700 from the Department of Agriculture alone—the department that administers food assistance or SNAP.

That means that as we fight for solutions, we have to remember to use an intersectional lens.		The people most impacted by the effects of climate change will be the same who suffer now. 		People of color. 	Indigenous people. 	Refugees and victims of war.	The poor.
We make a mistake when we think of climate change as one of many political issues. 		It isn’t. It’s the whole thing.		Our planet is our only home.		If we don’t limit further harm, alter our behavior and develop resilience as the climate changes, we doom our species.

We have to find the root causes of domestic terrorism.		We need gun reform to keep innocents safe. 		We need to be honest about how social media has made it easier to radicalize young men. 		And we need to talk about how white supremacy, sexism &amp; racism perpetuate the problem.
So while the President protects the interests of the millionaire manufacturers of guns, he has done nothing to significantly protect our children, or any one else, from gun violence. 		Since that day at Sandy Hook in 2012, over 1,900 mass shootings have happened across the US.
But instead of looking for ways to stop the rise of white supremacy, the President has only stoked the flames. He has called extremists "fine people" and illegally coordinated with the NRA, his biggest independent booster, to get himself elected.		https://t.co/0jZAd1Bn26

We give corporations huge tax breaks, we can afford to give hardworking Americans a break too. 		We can afford to relieve the burden of student debt. 		#MondayMorning
Until we respect ALL workers...		Until people who work full time can actually afford to support their families...		Until the cost of college stops skyrocketing, we need a solution for those who can’t afford a degree, or we are just increasing the wealth gap.
We treat retail and service workers like they are less than human. We argue that people without degrees don’t deserve a living wage because they are “unskilled.”		We give poor students a choice—take on the debt or be looked down upon.
Some people respond to the idea of canceling student debt with the idea that borrowers made a bad choice to take on debt.		No. We forced their hand.		We tell people the only path to success is a degree, that the debt is worth it. 		We shame people without degrees.

I reject the false dichotomy created by the fossil fuel industry between having jobs and a clean environment.		We must break the fossil fuel industry’s monopoly over our energy grid and create a just transition to a green economy.
As the devastation caused by our changing climate becomes more real, it’s clearer now than ever that we are in desperate need of a #GreenNewDeal. 		We need urgent action—and real commitment— to break our addiction to fossil fuels.

The primary election is Tuesday, August 14th!		Have you done your research yet? Here's why we think you should vote for #TeamIlhan → https://t.co/v0xTWgHpT4 https://t.co/Knnj2SUpaf
This administration puts together destructive legislation working to divide us. It’s not winner take all. A gain for rural Minnesota doesn’t mean that metro areas experience a loss and vice versa. Everyone deserves a seat at the table, and I will work for that. #MN05 #D5MNForum
Abolish ICE. There is no compromise.		Our immigration system is deeply broken. We shouldn’t seek to punish families seeking safety and opportunity. We should create fair and accessible pathways to citizenship. #MN05 #D5MNForum
Two of the ways we ensure economic security for working families is by advocating for a federal $15 min. wage and accessible housing. We want young ppl to have pathways to upward mobility. That’s not possible if our legislators aren’t working on behalf of them. #MN05 #D5MNForum
I’m a millennial with student debt. I know the cost barriers to education is unacceptable especially when compared to the tax breaks we give to the wealthy. Debt-forgiveness and tuition-free college is an investment in our students, our people, and our economy. #MN05 #D5MNForum
I was a nutrition educator and a policy fellow. I’ve spent years building relationships to address health disparities in our communities and I’m the most well-equipped to continue these conversations in Congress.  #MN05 #D5MNForum
My sister is a healthcare worker. We often have conversations about how unbelievable the infant mortality rates for Black and Indigenous women in this country are, but that’s our reality. This is a larger issue of how and who we are deciding to invest in. #MN05 #D5MNForum
When we have conversations about how to pay for Medicare for All, we have to remember that republicans are citing incorrect math. It can be done. We want to make sure our budget reflects our values as Americans. #MN05 #D5MNForum
Coalition building is a fundamental part of working towards environmental justice. This is why organizations like @SierraClub and @MN350Action have endorsed my candidacy. We are committed and we have a plan, you can read it below ⬇️ #MN05 #D5MNForum https://t.co/hX9azBZZne

Ultimately however, temporary protections are not enough, we need reliable paths to citizenship for all TPS and DACA recipients.
We must stand with families living under TPS, and we have to do all we can to make sure separation is not a possibility. We are thankful for the extension granted to Yemen and hope the same for Somalia while remaining disheartened that the same opportunity was not given to Haiti.
There’s no question that the conditions in countries like Somalia meet the criteria for TPS. If deported, people risk losing jobs and will ultimately be separated from their children, family, and community. These families are in jeopardy of being re-traumatized.
Temporary Protected Status (TPS) allows citizens from countries affected by civil conflict or natural disasters to legally live and work in the United States. This is a critical program providing individuals and families with short-term stability and support.
On Thursday, the Trump administration will announce its decision to renew, redesignate or allow a non-renewal for current TPS recipients from Somalia whose legal status is set to expire in September. This means the future of our Somali neighbors living here under TPS is uncertain

no one leaves home until home is a sweaty voice in your ear	saying-	leave,	run away from me now	i dont know what i’ve become	but i know that anywhere	is safer than here		#home #warsanshire #poems
home is the barrel of the gun	and no one would leave home	unless home chased you to the shore	unless home told you	to quicken your legs	leave your clothes behind	crawl through the desert	wade through the oceans	drown	save	be hunger	beg	forget pride	your survival ismore important
roll off your backs	maybe because the blow is softer	than a limb torn off	or the words are more tender	than fourteen men between	your legs	or the insults are easier	to swallow	than rubble	than bone	than your child body	in pieces.	i want to go hom	but home is the mouth of a shark
no one skin would be tough enough the	go home blacks	refugees	dirty immigrants	asylum seekers	sucking our country dry	niggers with their hands out	they smell strange	savage	messed up their country and now they want	to mess ours up	how do the words	the dirty looks
no one chooses refugee camps	or strip searches where your	body is left aching	or prison, because prison is safer	than a city of fire	and one prison guard	in the night is better than a truckload	of men who look like your father	no one could take it	no one could stomach it
no one burns their palms	under trains	beneath carriages	no one spends days and nights in the stomach of a truck	feeding on newspaper unless the miles travelled	means something more than journey.	no one crawls under fences	no one wants to be beaten	pitied
only tearing up your passport in an airport toilets	sobbing as each mouthful of paper	made it clear that you wouldn’t be going back.		you have to understand,	that no one puts their children in a boat	unless the water is safer than the land
Home 	no one leaves home unless home chases you	fire under feet	hot blood in your belly	it’s not something you ever thought of doing	until the blade burnt threats into	your neck	and even then you carried the anthem under	your breath		#home #warsanshire #poems	#WhereAreTheChildren
