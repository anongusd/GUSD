@davidhogg111 All of you people saying "this makes zero sense" are literally fucking dense in the head. How does preventing people from having guns or making it harder to get them make them safer against people who intend to do harm not make sense?
It's not a matter of passing a background check to buy guns, it's about the bullshit unnecessarity of having to go through a background check every time you handle a gun that you don't own. They would turn gun owners into prospective criminals for no reason. https://t.co/6QJIkmLgTG

@christygood @openingtirade @DavidLWink @galenh @davidhogg111 @POTUS Not to mention most gun deaths globally are suicides. Oh cool gun deaths went down thanks to common sense gun laws but guess what, suicide rates stayed the same. So now your gun laws prevented literally nothing except making it harder for good people to acquire them.
@christygood @openingtirade @DavidLWink @galenh @davidhogg111 @POTUS Nothing is wrong with that. The problem is they can still get them. Just not legally. And when you get into psych evals for gun purchases it's too impractical. Who's going to set the standard? Just because you're fucked in the head doesn't mean you're fucked in the heart.
@mapM_ Exactly. The only reason we can't hunt with a .223/5.56 in some situations is because it was deemed not powerful enough to kill deer.
@scottarents @RepThompson Why even bother? Assault weapons don't actually exist. Assault is a verb not an adjective. And psych evaluations for "gun nuts" isn't going to solve anything, like background checks. Guns aren't the problem. It's society.
22,000 gun laws on the books federally and at the state level. If you can't get it right by then and stop gun violence, nothing is going to work. Don't fuck over 99.991% of gun owners because .009% choose to take their live or someone else's. #2ndAmendment #opposeHR8 #S66
@scottarents @RepThompson You can't measure evil or hostile intent in a psych eval. Just like a background check only shows criminal history not likelihood to commit a crime.
@scottarents @RepThompson The only issue with that is why sets the standard? Background checks already don't work to prevent violence. The psych eval standard set could cause people who would never hurt anyone to not buy a gun. But someone with a plan to commit murder could be granted one still.
@christygood @openingtirade @DavidLWink @galenh @davidhogg111 @POTUS What's worrisome is the lack of necessity for the bans proposed. Cosmetics and looks are not a reason to ban something. Random bans on things that are a subpercent of the problem is no reason to ban it. The bans are stupid and unnecessary
@christygood @openingtirade @DavidLWink @galenh @davidhogg111 @POTUS No. Most firearm receivers legally manufacturered for sale in the US are milled in a way that makes them nearly impossible to modify to full auto without degrading the functionality of the weapon. Bump stocks and cranks are the exception but are hardly used so it's a useless ban.
@openingtirade @christygood @DavidLWink @galenh @davidhogg111 @POTUS That's why this whole gun control shit is so fucking stupid.
