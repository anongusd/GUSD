@o_mfg Great thing!  Have a good day, Smarty Pants!  I'm going to the gym to work out with my son and grandchildren!
@o_mfg That is true but Obama never had a 3% quarter!  Plus, you are missing the point!  All you liberals thought that Trump would destroy the economy. It is booming instead!
@o_mfg I'm not goung to quibble about whether it was 1.8% or 2.0%.  The salient point is that it is now growing at over 3.0% despite all the negative expectations and coverage of the liberal MSM.
@o_mfg Quarters are not years!  You have to look at years!
@o_mfg Then you check it out and correct me with facts!
@o_mfg Tax inflows!
@o_mfg Yes, but in the first 3 months of Obama it fell to 8,000. (Due to inancial crisis). Afterwards, it grew at a nice rate for the following 7 years but nothing like it has grown since Trump's election!  The liberal economists said it would tank under Trump!
@o_mfg No, it is a natural thing when the economy grows!
@o_mfg Yes that is what I said. It is now the lowest ever!
@o_mfg Yes. Things were gradually improving. However, the improvement has sped up under Trump. The economy never grew at more than 1.8% to 2.0% under Obama.  It is now growing at 3% plus.  Remember all the liberal experts said the economy would collapse under Trump!  Didn't happen!

@polishprincessh Very nice!
@Mrs_Schwarzski @moarcowbelle @NYFarmer @paulkrugman This is a very debatable issue plus there was no estate tax back when our country was first formed. The federal estate tax was not put into law untill 1916.
@moarcowbelle @Mrs_Schwarzski @NYFarmer @paulkrugman Ha ha ha ha!
@moarcowbelle @Mrs_Schwarzski @paulkrugman Inheritance taxes levied by any government are assessed against assets that were bought with income that was already taxed.  Increases in values are typically due to inflation.  I believe all estate taxes are wrong for any asset owned at death such as homes, stocks, land, etc.!
@Marthastew_ @Mrs_Schwarzski @paulkrugman You are talking about a second issue.  We were talking how inheritance taxes create severe problems for family owned farms and small businesses.  The agricultural conglomerates were nentioned since they take advantage of the fact that people frequently can't pay the estate taxes.
@JacobAWohl I agree but I think he is sick of the political BS!
@moarcowbelle @Mrs_Schwarzski @paulkrugman I agree with you partly.  Many times, the way the estate tax works. the second and third generation offspring have to pay the Federal tax.
@NYFarmer @Mrs_Schwarzski @paulkrugman I agree!  The USA is one of the few countries in the world that have inheritance taxes.  They are one of the most unfair taxes that exist!
@Mrs_Schwarzski @paulkrugman The owned family farm is rapidly disappearing &amp; the big agricultural conglomerates are taking them over primarily due to the confiscatory nature of inheritance taxes.  Small businesses employ 70% of all workers in the USA.  These businesses have a difficult enough time as it is!
@Mrs_Schwarzski @paulkrugman The fact that your parents had to sell your grandparent's house had nothing to do with inheritance tax.  It, no doubt, had to do with the costs and expenses of the home like real estate taxes, maintenance, insurance, utilities, etc. and their individual financial situation.
@Mrs_Schwarzski @paulkrugman You don't understand the problem.  The inheritance tax is a tax on assets that have already been taxed.  For the family farm and most small businesses, the owners end up having to sell the farm or business to pay the taxes that can be confiscatory!
@Mrs_Schwarzski @paulkrugman Why don't you spend some time talking with families that own farms and small business owners?  You might learn something and you will find out who cares!  Your attitude seems to be more in line with what existed in the former USSR and that now exists in Cuba and Venezuela!
@paulkrugman Why dont you prove what you say!  Why should farms or small businesses pay for extremely expensive life insurance to allow for business or family ownership perpetuation?  I dont think you know what you are talking about!
@DineshDSouza This just goes to show you that the world is full of idiots!
@TomiLahren The liberal concept of "truth" is a very elusive thing as their truth changes to meet circumstances.  Liberals don't understand absolute truth.  Example: Harvey Weinstein was widely admired until the liberals decided to expose him for what he is.  What changed?
@Thomas1774Paine What really happened is that Miller made this guy look so dumb &amp; one sided that Tapper experienced "intellectual fear!"  You see, to a liberal, this is equivalent to the same kind of fear one experiences when really in physical danger.  Tapper then had to retire to a "safe zone!"
@GatesRobin Reminds me of the "privilege" I enjoyed in the early 1950's.  The point everyone misses is that the real privilege I had in my life had to do with the fact that I had a Mom &amp; Dad who loved their family and who taught their family about the Lord &amp; the value of hard work!

@Jackie_Blue_CA @Imperator_Rex3 @vivelafra @lukerosiak No doubt that you are right!
@o_mfg I was out all day working and did not see or hear anything about it.  The point is not how many links that you have pasted but how many SOB's the Trump administration is going after.  Compare this the recent reports about the Obama giving pass to Hezbolah drug trafficking !
@BreitbartNews Real classy students, aren't they?
@o_mfg It hasn't received much notice though in the main stream media!  Thanks for the link!
Check out this link:		https:/www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/21/donald-trump-sanctions-dozens-foreign-individuals-/		Has anyone seen this reported by the main stream media?
@krassenstein You are out of your mind!
@StefanMolyneux Well, The new head of the Democratic party could not be more obnoxious!  The guy is a real ass!

@RealJamesWoods Sure!  With the Dems it is how you say it, not what you say!
@DineshDSouza Oh, Dinesh!  I believe their is much more to find!
@realDonaldTrump I'm sure!  Ha ha ha!
@krassenstein It is only "chilling" due to the ignorance of the man who said it!
@WalshFreedom I finally agree with you!
@steph93065 This information needs to be widely reported and disseminated!  We all know the Dems want the vote and the hell with the people here legally!
@tedcruz The Dems are not for home schooling!  They want control over these families!
Friends and fellow twitterers,  The UN vote condemning Trump's Jerusalem move shows that the world is still a very antisemitic place!  The developed Nations are becoming Islamacized and they can't control their radical Muslim populations so they're blaming it on the Jews!  Sad!
@jeremymstamper @perez2_ivan @endthemaddnesss @PressSec @POTUS Apparently, you lost!
@jeremymstamper @PressSec @POTUS I'm a veteran and, yes, I can!  What makes you think that anyone, except for liberal dumbasses, would agree with you?
@Tay_J_Jones @TomPerez Thursday night, the Senate followed the House lead and passed a budget patch to fund the government through Jan. 19. The package included the House¬†plan (PDF)¬†to add just $2.85 billion to CHIP through March 31.		They plan to add more in 2018!
@AmbassadorRice The people of the USA are supposed to listen to you?  All you did was lie to the American public!  I thonk you ought to crawl back into your rat hole!
@washingtonpost I this all that you dummies can think about?  Try being less petty!
@TomPerez One more thing for you to complain about!  However, if the Democrats were willing to add E-verify, funding for the wall and an end to chain migration DACA would be passed easily!  Why dont you get your party to negotiate instead practicing and supporting "resistance!"
@KelemenCari Yeah!
@perlmutations Ron, You are a dope!  You don't know a muthafuckin thing!
I think that it is clear that most in the main stream media are publishing unsubstantiated stories &amp; hardly report any of the good accomplishments of the Trump administration.  This is beyond political bias!  It is dishonest and subversive.  To whom do these people really report?
@ananavarro No estoy de acuerdo. Puerto Ricanos que vienen a Florida cambiar√° sus actitudes pol√≠ticas cuando ven c√≥mo el gobierno deber√≠a funcionar.  ¬°Ser√°n los republicanos!
@ananavarro Ana, You are overlooking the fact that Puerto Rico is extremely corrupt.  Its the corrupt Puerto Rican politicians who are causing the delays and no one else!
@JacobAWohl Does anyone think that this guy and his family along the Democratic party leadership were not up to sime kind of chicanery?
@Thomas1774Paine Entonces, Adios amigo!
@ClintEastwoodLA @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Clint, You can surely help to spread the word to offset the Democratic resistance!  We need your voice and the voice of others like you!
@Education4Libs I guess he hadn't thought about that one!
@redsteeze What do you think it is?  What us your point?
@TomiLahren We already know why!  It wasn't THEIR tax cut!
@Education4Libs I used to like Tom Hanks before he started acting like a male Rosie O'Donnell!
@mitchellvii Quite frankly, with the progress that Trump is making and with all of the corruption of the Obama administration and the Democratic party that is gradually being exposed each day, a persin would have to be half brain dead to vote Democratic!
@SparkleSoup45 @starcrosswolf @FoxNews It is obvious that she is locked into a particular mind set!  She still thinks Obama is in charge!   The crap of the Obama Administration is gradually being exposed each and every day.  If our  DOJ and FBI do their jobs, it could get real interesting!

@RealSaavedra @GiglioMarilyn I'm beginning to feel sorry for Pelosi!
@ananavarro Ana, You are so fixated on DACA that you can't see the forest for the trees. If the Democrats will be reasonable about border securuty, E-verify and chain migration; DACA will be passed with provisions that protect US citizens.  Don't you think US citizens should be protected?
Friends and fellow Twitters, Have you ever in your life heard so much whining as is now being done by the Democrats!   While they are whining; the fraud, corruption and downright deceit of the Obama Administration and the Democratic party is being exposed more and more each day!
@o_mfg @Kenfriend5 Maybe you are putting too much faith in polls.  There us only so much the pollsters can do.  For example, most polls indicated that Romney was ahead of Obama just before the 2012 election.  Again, most polls showed that HRC would win the 2016 election.
@Lizzy_OMalley @jack Yeah!  It would seem so!  However, more importantly, are there really people this ignorant?  I was going to say "this f..........ng stupid" but I thought that I should show a bit more class!
@marklevinshow Do you really think anything will be done about this?
@o_mfg @Kenfriend5 OK, smarty pants, my intuition tells me that this poll is skewed by the following:		1.  A primarily Democratic leaning news media.	2.  A non representative polling sample.	3.  Possible bias of the pollster.		We will find out in the 2020 elections should Trump decide to run again.
@o_mfg I don't have a problem with it!  He delivered a good message.  Like I said in my previous tweet, the people who protested were ridiculous!  Just like some are acting with respect to protesting Ivanka Trump.
@o_mfg @Kenfriend5 One more comment on your point is that my "intuition" tells me that the poll is correct but I can't prove it!  Just like my "intuition" told me that the previous poll to which you refer is probably not correct.  My intuition is not always true but typically is.  Hey, I'm human!
@o_mfg @Kenfriend5 I did!  A poll is just a poll and not always correct.  However, HRC is quickly losing popularity even with Democrats!  The party is trying hard to leave her nehind! The poll is probably correct but could be wrong.  I doubt whether anyone can prove it one way or another.
@o_mfg Well, that was stupid!  People need to hear both sides of a subject.  Now, I am not saying that people have to, or should be forced to, listen to the ignorant rantings of white supremist groups or ANTIFA for example.  We live in a democratic republic.  Free speech is required!
@Fritz757 I agree!
@RodStryker The more that we see how the liberals behave the more we understand that they need psychological help!
@Kenfriend5 Well deserved!
@charliekirk11 Yep! The Dems have packed all their policies in these cities and, my oh my, what examples of how to govern!  They want the same great results for the USA in general!  God help us!

If your argument were true, Mexico and many of the poorer nations in the world would have really low birth rates.  The concentration of wealth is greater in these countries than the USA.
@DineshDSouza @CNN Yes, and now the dim witted Democrats are complaining about it!
@Lrihendry What do you expect from a bball player, albeit a damn good one!
@Lizzy_OMalley Very good point, Elizabeth!

@JanetMaxLive @mikandynothem @realDonaldTrump @Corrynmb @LindaSuhler @StacyLStiles @surfermom77 @Miami4Trump @TrumpsBlonde @RightWingAngel @FemalesForTrump @joegretchen94 @GrizzleMeister I guess we can all justify our positions in our own minds!  What will you say if the birth rate increases under Tump!  What if the economy booms and the GDP growth doubles that of Obama? Lets compare notes in a few years!  The facts that you note led to the 13.6% uninsured rate.
@JanetMaxLive @mikandynothem @realDonaldTrump @Corrynmb @LindaSuhler @StacyLStiles @surfermom77 @Miami4Trump @TrumpsBlonde @RightWingAngel @FemalesForTrump @joegretchen94 @GrizzleMeister Most of the claims have to do with Trump's business interests.  He has turned his businesses over to his sons.  He is already a billionaire!  You ought to be more concerned about others who are broke when elected but become wealthy in a few years.  How!
@JanetMaxLive @mikandynothem @realDonaldTrump @Corrynmb @LindaSuhler @StacyLStiles @surfermom77 @Miami4Trump @TrumpsBlonde @RightWingAngel @FemalesForTrump @joegretchen94 @GrizzleMeister At the end of 2012 around 13.6% of the people in the USA were uninsured.  When Obama left office it was roughly 10.6%.  42,000,000 vs. 28,000 000 and insurance policies cost much much more and most have huge deductibles.  I would not call this a historic accomplishment!
@JanetMaxLive @mikandynothem @realDonaldTrump @Corrynmb @LindaSuhler @StacyLStiles @surfermom77 @Miami4Trump @TrumpsBlonde @RightWingAngel @FemalesForTrump @joegretchen94 @GrizzleMeister Check this link.  It was written by a Democrat leaning news service:	https://t.co/5e8cHoigXq

This one of many scandals in the 1st year.
@JanetMaxLive @mikandynothem @realDonaldTrump @Corrynmb @LindaSuhler @StacyLStiles @surfermom77 @Miami4Trump @TrumpsBlonde @RightWingAngel @FemalesForTrump @joegretchen94 @GrizzleMeister I dont need to document this!  Just ask people what happened to their insurance programs since the advent of Obama Care!  I have not had 1 person tell me that their insurance became cheaper or better in any way.  I work with hundreds of diverse  people.  All say the same thing.
@JanetMaxLive @mikandynothem @realDonaldTrump @Corrynmb @LindaSuhler @StacyLStiles @surfermom77 @Miami4Trump @TrumpsBlonde @RightWingAngel @FemalesForTrump @joegretchen94 @GrizzleMeister Your tweets about Trump's ethical issues reflect fake news.
@JanetMaxLive @mikandynothem @realDonaldTrump @Corrynmb @LindaSuhler @StacyLStiles @surfermom77 @Miami4Trump @TrumpsBlonde @RightWingAngel @FemalesForTrump @joegretchen94 @GrizzleMeister I think the pre-existing condition change was a good thing.  However, this could have been solved without screwing up the entire medical care in the USA!
@JanetMaxLive @mikandynothem @realDonaldTrump @Corrynmb @LindaSuhler @StacyLStiles @surfermom77 @Miami4Trump @TrumpsBlonde @RightWingAngel @FemalesForTrump @joegretchen94 @GrizzleMeister The birth rate decreased during the Obama administration!  Plus, most conservatives believe people have to solve their own problems, not the government.  We believe that the more the government takes, the less freedom we have!
@JanetMaxLive @mikandynothem @realDonaldTrump @Corrynmb @LindaSuhler @StacyLStiles @surfermom77 @Miami4Trump @TrumpsBlonde @RightWingAngel @FemalesForTrump @joegretchen94 @GrizzleMeister Again, when was this and what were the curcumstances?
@JanetMaxLive @mikandynothem @realDonaldTrump @Corrynmb @LindaSuhler @StacyLStiles @surfermom77 @Miami4Trump @TrumpsBlonde @RightWingAngel @FemalesForTrump @joegretchen94 @GrizzleMeister There are bad cases that one can point to for the justification of a point.  However, think about the millions of women who lost good insurance due to the ACA.They then had to get more expensive insurance with deductibles of $4,000 to $10,000. Previous deductibles were much less.
@JanetMaxLive @mikandynothem @realDonaldTrump @Corrynmb @LindaSuhler @StacyLStiles @surfermom77 @Miami4Trump @TrumpsBlonde @RightWingAngel @FemalesForTrump @joegretchen94 @GrizzleMeister If she had not allowed her insursnce to lapse or if she got another policy so that she had no lapsed coverage, she would gave been covered.  Even under Obama Care, once you have it and you allow it to lapse, the insurance companies can invoke the pre-existing claim.
@JanetMaxLive @mikandynothem @realDonaldTrump @Corrynmb @LindaSuhler @StacyLStiles @surfermom77 @Miami4Trump @TrumpsBlonde @RightWingAngel @FemalesForTrump @joegretchen94 @GrizzleMeister This statement requires information.  When did the lady become pregnant?  When was the baby born?  In which State did she live?  Why didn't she have continuous coverage so that the pregnancy would have been covered?  Was she employed?  Was she married? Answer pending!
@JanetMaxLive @mikandynothem @realDonaldTrump @Corrynmb @LindaSuhler @StacyLStiles @surfermom77 @Miami4Trump @TrumpsBlonde @RightWingAngel @FemalesForTrump @joegretchen94 @GrizzleMeister It is a joy to see Trump bit by bit cleaning up and eliminating the  ill effects of the Obama administration!
@JanetMaxLive @mikandynothem @realDonaldTrump @Corrynmb @LindaSuhler @StacyLStiles @surfermom77 @Miami4Trump @TrumpsBlonde @RightWingAngel @FemalesForTrump @joegretchen94 @GrizzleMeister I was joking about the dope!  However, I fear that you are in la la land.  Thank God that the republicans kept him from inflicting even more damage on our country!
@JanetMaxLive @mikandynothem @realDonaldTrump @Corrynmb @LindaSuhler @StacyLStiles @surfermom77 @Miami4Trump @TrumpsBlonde @RightWingAngel @FemalesForTrump @joegretchen94 @GrizzleMeister The Democratic party is in no position to criticize anyone's ethics!
@JanetMaxLive @mikandynothem @realDonaldTrump @Corrynmb @LindaSuhler @StacyLStiles @surfermom77 @Miami4Trump @TrumpsBlonde @RightWingAngel @FemalesForTrump @joegretchen94 @GrizzleMeister You are free to think whatever you wish. In time, it will be revealed, even more than we now know, that Obama was crooked and destructive President.
@JanetMaxLive @mikandynothem @realDonaldTrump @Corrynmb @LindaSuhler @StacyLStiles @surfermom77 @Miami4Trump @TrumpsBlonde @RightWingAngel @FemalesForTrump @joegretchen94 @GrizzleMeister You have been smoking dope if   you think the Obama administration wss scandal free!
@mikandynothem @realDonaldTrump @Corrynmb @LindaSuhler @StacyLStiles @surfermom77 @Miami4Trump @TrumpsBlonde @RightWingAngel @FemalesForTrump @joegretchen94 @GrizzleMeister The faster Trump eliminates all that Obama did the better off we will be!

@JohnC5359 @WalshFreedom It's sad that all you can do to defend your positions, like most Democrats, is to cast aspersions on others.  I know lots of people like you.  I have dealt with hundreds of negative people who blame all their misery on others!  I hope that you can rid yourself of negativity!
@JohnC5359 @WalshFreedom I don't doubt facts, you have not supplied any! Are you an atheist? If you are, you ought to try being a good one by thinking logically! A true Christian would never deem anyone to be guilty of something without proof. This is how we think! "Thou shalt not bear false witness!"
@JohnC5359 @WalshFreedom If any of the allegations against Trump, or anyone else,  are verified by concrete evidence, and not by hearsay or "he said, she said" talk, I would be the first to say "resign!"  However, in today's politicized environment, allegations are not proof! People need to be skeptical!
@JohnC5359 @WalshFreedom As vulger as these words are, they are not admissions to any specific allegations. Anderson Cooper¬†asked candidate Trump point blank whether he had ‚Äúactually kissed women without consent or groped women without consent?" Trump denied that he had, responding ‚ÄúNo, I have not.‚Äù
@JohnC5359 @WalshFreedom Trump has not admitted to anything!
@JohnC5359 @WalshFreedom If he didn't do anything, why did he resign!
@JohnC5359 @WalshFreedom Democratic &amp; Republicans in congress who paid off sexual harrassment cases with taxpayers money have documented cases in government records and eventually they will all be exposed. Rep Conyers cases have been exposed.  There were photos of Fuenken!  These are proven not alleged!
@JohnC5359 @WalshFreedom Alleged!  The senate would have done an investigation and, if the allegations were verified, Moore would have been ousted along with the other Democrat perverts in congress but the Alabama seat would remain Republican!

@TuckerCarlson @MarkSteynOnline @FoxNews It is pitiful how rediculous things have become in this country.
@WalshFreedom That is probably due to the fact that 70% of Americans don't understand our tax system or economics.  Plus, the news media is trying to turn people against the plan.  I'm a CPA and the new tax plan will be very good for the country and the average American!  #MAGA
@ANOMALY1 @dbongino @FBI Look, anyone with brains knows the entire Mueller investigation is a cover up for all the crimes committed by Obama, Holder, Lynch, Comey, Mueller, Bill Clinton and all the other corrupt SOB's in the government with respect to the Uraniam One Deal, Hillary's deleted emails, etc.!

@mitchellvii Don't you think this is why Moore has not conceded?
@mitchellvii @DianeMo24012416 They who failed to vote have allowed the Democrats to equalize power in the Senate.  The harm that the Dems can now do in resisting our Pres's agenda is way beyond any harm an "alleged" sex abuser could ever do!  People need to understsnd just how evil the Democratic party is!
@realDonaldTrump 		Mr. President, You have it in your power to calm things down.  Forge ahead with your agenda.  However, refer all questions re: sex abuse to your lawyers.  DO NOT ATTACK THE WOMEN!  Finally, tell Steve Bannon to stay out of sponsoring candidates. No more losses!

They need to be proven in  courtor at least by some independent or respected authority besides a group of political hacks!  If the women are serious, they should allow themselves to be cross examined.  Otherwise, anyone can allege whatever!
@RWNJsCanFO @Thomas1774Paine @bogiebeagle2 Check this link:		https://t.co/72MsJsmX0k
@RWNJsCanFO @Thomas1774Paine @bogiebeagle2 With respect to Moore, I live in Ohio so I don't have a vote in AL.  If I lived there, I would not vote at all.  If Moore is elected, the Senate will do an investigstion.  He will probably be ousted.
@RWNJsCanFO @Thomas1774Paine @bogiebeagle2 It just seems a bit strange that all these allegations arose during an election.  All people deserve due process of the law.  If congress did an investigation and found the allegations credible or closely substantiated, I would support resignation.
@RWNJsCanFO @Thomas1774Paine @bogiebeagle2 Based upon your position, did you feel the same way about Clinton?
@RWNJsCanFO @Thomas1774Paine @bogiebeagle2 I just read through each allegation and none of them involve rape.  Send me your sources.
@RWNJsCanFO @Thomas1774Paine @bogiebeagle2 Remember, that there needs to be legal action with a guilty verdict to put someone in prison.  If the charges are real, the women should file charges.
@RWNJsCanFO @Thomas1774Paine @bogiebeagle2 There is probably some truth to some of the allegations.  DT has not been accused of actual rape.  He is suing at least one of the women.  Most of the allegations have not been substantiated.  I have read through all 19 allegations.  It was much different with BC!
@RWNJsCanFO @Thomas1774Paine @bogiebeagle2 Yes, Always did!
@RWNJsCanFO @Thomas1774Paine @bogiebeagle2 Yes, unlike the Dems who supported Bill Clinton with all of the well publicised sexual harrassment and rape charges against him but who are now throwing him under the bus. They all of a sudden got wise whereas before they ignored the obvious. Wisdom or  Political Expediency?
@RepAdamSchiff Just like the rest of your Democratic associates, you are embellishing facts!  You need to take a step backwards &amp; try to think through what you tweeted!  Let's try to only speak the truth and real facts!  You sound like all the reporters who have had to correct their reporting.
@Thomas1774Paine @bogiebeagle2 Yes, I believe that he was set up!  The deep state at work again trying to cover up their own crines!
I watched a portion of the congressional hearing with FBI Director Wray.  He kept saying that he is waiting for the report of the Inspector General. How do we know that the IG is not corrupt?  If he were so good, why did he do nothing prior to Trump‚Äôs election.  This is more BS!
@TrumpNewsz He is out of his mind!
"Trump‚Äôs North Korea policy could trigger famine, experts warn.  https://t.co/HboB3KkUr9"		I saw this today in AOL.  Don't the idiots at AOL know that North Korea is already in famine with millions starving!  This is the subtle misleading BS to which people with brains object!
@chuckwoolery Now there are some really sharp SOB's!  I sure glad that we have at least 11 good ones to be able to use their extensive learning to educate the youth of the nation!
@WalshFreedom @FoxNews You might want to rethink your claim.  You might be very embarrassed when ALL the truth comes out!  Mueller might think he us working in the best interest of the USA but so isn't Maxine Watters with all of her babble!

@KelemenCari @MargosunC Just shows that our former President was not all that bright!
@dbongino Remember, the fact that no European nation had the cajones to stand up to Hitler led to WW II.  This is just another example of the same kind of stupidity!  Had the right thing been done yesrs ago, the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital would not be an issue!
Here is a quote worth considering in today's crazed political climate:		 ‚ÄúMaturity is the ability to think, speak and act your feelings within the bounds of dignity. The measure of your maturity is how spiritual you become during the midst of your frustrations.‚Äù		-Samuel Ullman
@surfermom77 It would be nice to know why!
@bgood12345 @Pink_About_it It is beyond rediculous!  I believe the leftist based corruption in our government is many times worse than we can imagine!
@stillgray We should have more of these idiots in the USA?
@AgendaOfEvil Europe is being "Islamacized" and within 20 to 30 years will be just like the destitute and chaotic countries from whence the migrants and religion came!  Europeans had better wake up before it is too late!

@DefundtheRINOS @Lizzy_OMalley I agree with you!
@steph93065 @realDonaldTrump Steph,  I think that you hit it right on the nose!
@LucidxHurricane @Lizzy_OMalley I don't believe that anything has happened yet!

@Truthseeker126 @steph93065 Creo que el invitado en Tucker Carlson esta noche se confunde uno individual!
@PeterSweden7 @bsgirl2u I hope that the government of Sweden gets this crime and chaos under control!
@Carpophores @itswildrich @Lizzy_OMalley There are lots if good well meaning and thinking liberals such as Senator Joe Manchin.  The problem is that they are being silenced by the dopes.
@DefundtheRINOS @Lizzy_OMalley Yes, but they don't have to build a new one.  I will bet that they will move into the consulate building.  Previous Presidents promised to move the embassy to Jerusalem but, I believe, that they used the cost to build the new embassy as an excuse not to do what they promised.
@Carpophores @itswildrich @Lizzy_OMalley I agree but there is "liberal" as in open minded and then there is "liberal" as in brain dead -  i.e. the famous lawyer Alan Dershowitz vs. Joy Behar!
@virgule88 @itswildrich @Lizzy_OMalley Are Democrats really concerned about the cost if anything?
@SLandinSoCal Proves what we akready knew!  He's  a lying SOB!
@EvanG1126 @Lizzy_OMalley Where are they going to be now?
@Lizzy_OMalley Sometimes principle is more important than money!  Plus, you dont think that is doesn't  cost us to protect the embassy in Tel Aviv?
@MinnPatriot You have to be kidding!  "Giant of the Senate?"  I believe the real title ought to be "Little Outboing Perverted Piss Ant of the Senate!"
@ThomasWictor @brook_western Please explain your theory!
@PoliticalShort I guess that she is senile now too in addition to Pelosi!
@Lizzy_OMalley Excuse me but it is only about 45 miles miles from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.  Plus only a liberal would not know the following:		Moving U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem Only Requires New Sign on Consulate Building, City Officials Say
@TuckerCarlson 	Your guest tonight, Peter Shurman, was touting the one world government.  This is just a regurgitation of the beliefs of Karl Marx.  We have seen how well communism works!  Oh! Excuse me!  Around 100,000,000 humans died needlessly in the experiment!
mis¬∑cre¬∑ant		Ààmiskrƒì…ônt/		noun		1. A person who behaves badly or in a way that breaks the law.		synonyms: criminal,¬†culprit,¬†wrongdoer, offender,¬†villain,¬†lawbreaker, evil doer,¬†delinquent,¬†hoodlum,¬†reprobate, malfeasant		Sounds like the definition of a left wing Democrat!
@RealSaavedra @DebraMMason1 Who cares?  Only miscreants listen to Chris Matthews!
@GovMikeHuckabee @shumakerhill @realDonaldTrump I love you Governor but no one could be this stupid as to include this letter with the application to work with Mueller!

@southern_raynes @doublel71 I'll drink to that!
@southern_raynes @doublel71 The Republican party is a million times better than the party of miscreants, the Democratic party!
@mike_Zollo @brook_western It won't work!  Trump is suing the woman who made accusations against him and Moore has denied these claims from 40 years ago.  The Democratic miscreants, Conyers and Franken, have either paid off claimants with our money or they can't deny photos!
@KamVTV @womensmarch @DNC @TheDemocrats Sounds like he has a wonderful plan!
President Donald Trump's newfound lisp sets internet aflame		https://t.co/HboB3KCvPJ¬†3 hrs ago		This was a news notice on AOL.  Can you believe how shallow these creeps are?  History tells us that Abraham Lincoln had a high pitched odd voice.  What should we think of AOL?
@JimmySpeath88 @WalshFreedom So what is your point?  We should all have no spines?
@WalshFreedom @GeneDouglas7 Dont you love it when Europeans bitch about Trump!  Now just just consider European history!  Let's consider how the Europeans tried to placate Hitler.  They helped to create the Holocaust and WW II  that resulted in the death of at least 30,000,000 human beings.

@CollinRugg If you study the similarities between Nazism  or facism, to the current day left wing Democratic party, the similarities are alarming!
@WayneDupreeShow He is correct! However, the Christian "mythical belief" begsn around 32 AD.  The Hebrew "mythical" belief started around 1500 BC.  Both of the alleged "mythical" beliefs were well befire the advent of Islam in the 7th Century AD.
@chuckwoolery It is amazing how people elected to the congress of the USA are so hell bent on proving how ignorant they are!
@2christian I agree and I'm Catholic!  I'm a convert actually!   Pope Francis is a good man but I believe that he is locked into an anti USA, South American mind set that he needs to change!
@AmyMek I guess their logic is "if we hide it and ignore it, it doesn't exist!"  Brilliant!

@NancyPelosi Nancy,  so you sre the one who decides who stsys and who doesn't!  Now we can clearly see your, and the leftist Democrats, facist attitude!  You are so tied to your ideology that you can't hide it with your "better than thou" arrogant attutude!
@johncardillo @TRUMPMOMENTS1 This might be BS.  No one keeps records from 20 yesrs back.  Banks are only required to keep them for 7 years by US law..

@chuckwoolery "voted for Trump" not "boted for Trumin"  - Sorry!
@chuckwoolery Chuck,  If the government can't clean itself up, how or who will do it!  The corruption seems to be too widespread!  Many of us boted for Trumin hoping that he would ckean things up.  However, two of his key appointments, FBI Director Wray and AG Sessions, seem to be AWOL!
@chuckwoolery Are all these liberal Democrats brain damaged!
@steph93065 @realDonaldTrump I agree!  FBI Director Wray and AG Sessions seem to have been neutered by the deep state!
@bgood12345 Our government must be cleaned up!   It won't happen unless we all raise hell with our elected officials and a with massive march of millions on Washington!
@USArealnews Millions of us need to march on Washington and raise hell until the BS is exposed and ended!

@Education4Libs @violin002 Pretty damn obvious isn't it!
@marklevinshow @tomtomokie I dont understand why noone seems to understand what is happening!  They are out to get Trump anyway they can!  They being those in the government who were also there with Obama who are trying to keep their asses out of jail for the crimes they comitted over the 8 years of Obama!
@SteveBannen @Georgia1006 Steve, Yes but why doesn't congress do anything about it!
@gs777gs777 Friends,  I have been saying all along that the entire Mueller investigation is a scam in which the deep state (Mueller, Comey, Rosenstein, McCabe and others) wants to get Trump before he gets them!
@mitchellvii @Georgia1006 The media is so anti trump that one can believe very little of what they say.  I have a feeling that excluding the big Democratic (CA, NY, IL) states that his approval is around 60%.
@PrisonPlanet Because they want to mainstream sexual deviance!
@LeaveEUOfficial @SaraPadmore @Nigel_Farage Liberals throughout the world exist in a second world reality of "what they think" and not in the actual reality of "what really is!"
@Nigel_Farage @flgal4trump liberals
@Nigel_Farage @flgal4trump Nigel, It is because the left leaning libersls in the world are nuts!
@AJCGlobal My jewish friends,  It seems to me that the actions of the Obama Administration, that were very anti-Israel and pro Iran, certainly did not help to diffuse the rising anti-Semitic events.  I suggest that the attitude of the past Obama Administration contributed to anti-Semitism.
The Democrats would appose a tax bill that balanced the budget, funded all of their pet projects, charged the rich 10% more taxes, refunded or paid $5,000 to every person in poverty,  guaranteed the financial strength of social security and medicare if it was a Republican bill!
@AnaisNincompoop @realDonaldTrump @MLRBETRUEBEREAL You have mussed the point.  The Democrats had control and they were not going to do anything.  Republicans are in charge now!
@notabot87654321 @realDonaldTrump @MLRBETRUEBEREAL I think that he can or he can get a new AG if the current one does nothing.  The AG works for the President!
@DRUDGE @immigrant_legal Obama is a serious ass!  He needs to be arrested if he doesn't cut out the crap!  His time is over and now he is interfering in our foreign policy!  Isn't this the same thing the ignorant Democrats claimed that Trump was doing that merits impeachment?  This is insane!
@realDonaldTrump @MLRBETRUEBEREAL Mr. President,  The deleted emails situation is just one of many issues related to Hillary.  You are the President!  Can't you demand that the justice department do its job?
@We_R_TheMedia @JohnTDolan Governor Brown will probably get a kick back from the drug companies that produce the anti HIV medicines.  How else can you explain such a stupid thing!
@realDonaldTrump @VotingFemaIe President Trumo,  Please light a fire under AG Sessions to get serious about investigating  Uranium One, the Clinton Foundation, the Fusion Dossier, etc.  This must be started and started soon to save your Prvesidency.  AG Sessions is too lethargic.  We need a special councel.
@SLandinSoCal I agree with you.  It is pitiful'

@TruthinGov2016 @Nikkki_R Obama is a serious ass!  He needs to be arrested if he doesn't cut out the crap!  His time is over and now he is interfering in our foreign policy!  Isn't this the same thing the ignorant Democrats claimed that Trump was doing that merits impeachment?  This entire is insane!
@PrisonPlanet @NancieDoyle Oh yes,  We are witnessing some really even handed application of the law!  Are we to believe that it is more serious to lie under oath to the FBI than to the congress while under oath?  Isn't congress supposed to be responsible for oversight of the FBI?
@KamVTV Well said, Kambree!
@CharlieDaniels @X1Titan Charlie, Apparently, San Franciscoans believe it was the "gun's fault" not the guy who fired the gun, who had been deported numerous times and who was a convicted felon!

@AnthonyScarramu @KatrinaPierson @POTUS So true!
@KatrinaPierson @HorseShort @POTUS That could be a good sign but I doubt it!

@TuckerCarlson @GeraldineMCorn1 @FoxNews Tucker, It is amazing to me that AG Sessions has not prosecuted officials in the sanctuary cities who have, and are,  breaking federal law!
@thebradfordfile @GeraldineMCorn1 The only way this is going to happen would be if a few million of us hit the streets in Washington, D. C. and shut the town down until a special counsel is named to start the investigation of the Clintons, Uranium One. the BS with the DNC and related matters.
@TuckerCarlson @GeraldineMCorn1 @FoxNews I think this is clearly obvious!

@ABC @immigrant_legal This is a problem?  I don't think so!
@voodooqueen86 @BitchPills_ @KTHopkins I don't!  However enough of them do which is resulting in  murder of innocents, despair, persecution and upheaval throughout the world!
@KTHopkins @swood50 Kate,  It seems that logic escapes a good percentage of the people in the world!
@ChatwitChuck @GeorgiaDirtRoad You have described how it should be!
@Stump4TrumpPAC Yes, they are!
@JackPosobiec @penny_fuente I hate to say this but remember that we are witnessing, in clear form, the deep state at work!

@ChazEbert @AbcarianLAT @MargHartmann @EmilyRPeck I think you are off base!
@LouDobbs @tjc1943 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS If it is unlawful for Trump to attempt to affect foreign policy before he was President, than why isn't the same with Obama out making an ass of himself trying to affect foreign policy and the positions of other countries in contradiction of of the Trump administration?
@JoeBelsha @BlueSea1964 This is especially true with so many blacks saying that they hate whites and they don't realize they are being racist when they act this way!
Did anyone see the Mike Rowe interview on Tucker Carkson this evening?  Not only does Mike have a great message but he is also hilarious!

@vannsmole @kwilli1046 I agree!
@RichHamblin11 @BlueSea1964 Excuse me, she did much more than lie!
@Sal929 @SteveBannen We can only hope that this is the case!  However, given Mueller's and Comey's role in the Uranium One deal and their friendship, I am afraid the real criminals are trying to save their own asses!
@SteveBannen @brook_western The deep state people such as Mueller, Comey and the other jackasses in the Obama Administration know that if they csn destroy Trump that many of them are heading for major legal issues along with the deceitful Clintons and Obama!
@dbongino @adowling40 This is the "deep state" out to get Trump before he can get them!
@SaraCarterDC What is the problem with this?  This seems to be very minor compared to the chicanery of the  Obama Administration, the Clintons and the DNC that we are gradually learning about.  I this is the deep state trying ti get Trump before he cleans the swamp. #cleantheswamp
@JaydaBF @wi_for_trump @realDonaldTrump Many in Britain have the same political left wing crazy brain numbing stupidity as we have here in the USA.  They have just taken the nuttiness a bit further.  All people of good will need to wake up to the modern day muslim insurgency before it is too late!

@PrisonPlanet Our education system doesn't teach what really happened under communistic regimes.  In truth, many of our educational systems try to blame all evil on capitalism, the system that has lifted more people out of poverty than any other system in history!
@JackPosobiec @MIdifference2 Those responsible should be prosecuted and sent to prison!  How can any business permit this filth?
@ReneeCarrollPhx @RaymondShallen1 Probably because they suspect that they might soon be in "deep caca!"
@montgomeryoaks1 @JohnFromCranber Slavery was much more than a side issue leading to the civil war!  Read the writings of Abraham Lincoln on the subject prior to his election.  Read about the underground railroad and John Brown at Martins Ferry, WVA.  Slavery was the MAJOR issue!
@JohnFromCranber @JoanneOKTXNJ This seems so obvious that I can't understand why half of our population doesn't get it!
@GaltsGultch @ErrollmMcGowen She is another "news person" who doesn't have a clue!  Isn't it also very smug, arrogant, and elitist for her to talk in such a way about "lower class women?"   Does she not understand that the so called "lower class" women are primarily Democrat voters?
@LauraLoomer @lsarsour How can these anti-Semitic beliefs continue?  Are there brains out there that just can't be penetrated by justice, love, history, fairness and just good old "love your neighbor" thinking?

@TheJayWay26 @Georgia1006 @Patriotic_Va There are few options avaulable to the poor who Obama Care was intended to help.
@TheJayWay26 @Georgia1006 @Patriotic_Va The subsidies address the premium cost not the deductibles.  Why dont you ho back inside the cave where you belong!  Every tweet you make just displays your arrogant ignorance!
@TheJayWay26 @Georgia1006 @Patriotic_Va Jay not only does not know what he is talking about but he is also an ass!
@TheJayWay26 @Georgia1006 @Patriotic_Va You are not addressing coverage and deductibles which are obscene under Obama Care!  This is where the problens are!
@BillOReilly @CherylC52 There is a plague spreading throughout the world - lack of logic mixed with stupidity!
@RealJamesWoods @alozrasT Well, what can we say?  Our government again shows that it does not function to serve its citizens!  #draintheswamp
@WayneDupreeShow @alozrasT I guess this is an allegorical trend for modern day Democrats since the confederate statues are of Democrats of yesteryear!
@PhilMcCrackin44 @ScreamngEagle @SenWarren What a joke she is!
@WayneDupreeShow @IncognitoPatrio Another example that "facts" and "due process" don't mean much to a large portion of our society! #getthefacts
@NewtTrump @burk_burk4 Good for her! #UnsealTheDeals
@joegretchen94 @codeofvets @Stump4TrumpPAC Sorry for the spelling errors!  My fingers are too big for the tiny little keyboard on my phone!
@joegretchen94 @codeofvets @Stump4TrumpPAC Gretchen: Way to go!  I have been thinking thsat we need to have a mass march on Washington to demand action on several fronts.  We need to have an agenda of issues that we support!  I'll be there# https://t.co/WsxmjtiwCF
@TomPerez You are out if your mind!  Try telling the truth!
@Patriotic_Va Wendy,  More people need to hear your story as most people don't have a clue as to how bad Obama Care is!#repealobamacare
@chrissussdorf @GrizzleMeister Another example of Democratic logic!
@HarmlessYardDog @di_plora A real piece of logic!
@atensnut @USAloveGOD @chelseahandler Tell it like it is, Juanita!  God bless you!
@DalinPaur @GaryDeSantis He needs to tout his accomplishments as the news media certainly isn't!#go trump
@DineshDSouza Yes, They will be victims of their faulty ideologies and the failure to produce graduates who know anything useful to society!
@di_plora @MichellePiper18 Same to you, Bella!
@di_plora @MichellePiper18 You were included in my tweet since you had commented on someone else's tweet that said the USA is as bad as North Korea.  Sorry for the confusion!
@di_plora @MichellePiper18 Bella,  You need to take a break from public comments and spend some time studying history and current world events.  Hopefully, after this period of study, you wont make sny more ignorant statements!
HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL MY FRIENDS!		I HOPE YOU ALL HAVE A BEAUTIFUL DAY!		Be thankful for today and for the blessings that we have received in life.   Look forward to what is around the corner in our futures! https://t.co/IjSTnxX3Bg
@MADE__USA @TruthFeedNews The goofy guys are only making themselves to look ignorant!
@700wlw People are getting nutty!
@DiamondandSilk @GeraldineMCorn1 I love you two and your sarcastic sense of humor!
@charliekirk11 Sounds racist to me!
@AmyMek @allnews2nite Apparently, they have a real shortage of logic!
@GeorgiaDirtRoad @PhilMcCrackin44 @RepDeSantis Amen!
@Lrihendry @GeraldineMCorn1 Have a great Thanksgiving, Mr. President!
@SiddonsDan @GeraldineMCorn1 @kayleighmcenany The government needs to be required to disclose who has this money spent on their behalf!
@PhilMcCrackin44 @SenatorCollins The problem is that she can't decide which party she really belongs to!  This results in confusing statements and a head shaking "yes" but she is really thinking "no!"  A lot of Republicans are suffering from this same problem!
@JackPosobiec @idlegigi Seems like he has the same disease as most of our elected officials.  It's called "corrupt and deceit syndrome!"
@PhilMcCrackin44 @idlegigi He would be doing much better if not for the good old boys in Washington snd the brain dead Democrats!
@PJ03756028 @foxandfriends @ConstitutionPA @Scotus @POTUS @JudgeJeanine You would think so!
@foxandfriends @allnews2nite He's  a real hero!  Excuse me while I puke!
@ThePatriot143 @idlegigi He's a pervert and a liar!
@TwitchyTeam @Cameron_Gray I love all people regardless of country of origin but come on people!  We have not just the right but the responsibility to protect our borders and those who are in our country legally!
@TwitchyTeam @Cameron_Gray How could any logical and thoughtful person not understand why we need to control our borders and get rid of the illegals who are here committing crimes.  Will some left wing person with an above average IQ please explain how they can justify sanctuary cities and open borders?
RT @RealJamesWoods: Maybe because her strategy of owning the media, getting millions of illegal votes, spending over a billion dollars in c‚Ä¶
@ThinBlueLR @idlegigi It pisses me off!  Drain the swamp!
@SLandinSoCal @idlegigi The amount of corruption in our government that is being exposed is beyond belief!  No doubt about it, we need to drain the swamp!
@JackPosobiec @airbornesailor It makes me sick to learn that members of congress have their "good old boy" slush fund to pay off their victims with taxpayer money!  What the hell is wrong with these people?
@MooreSenate @airbornesailor If a team of handwriting experts find that the signature is not Moore's, the lady would lose all credibility!
Tonight Tucker Carlson way understated the murders in Mexico due to illegal drugs!
@TuckerCarlson Over 100,000 people have disappeared in State of Guerero, Mex alone!
