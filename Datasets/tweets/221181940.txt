@Backstorymom1 YEAH I was wondering if that was code for white racist. Seriously their conduct is ridiculous.
@KarsinXXX I hear you. Can you believe Trump's tweet filled with sexual misconduct today? In the work place too.
@maziehirono @dumptrump33 @realDonaldTrump Isn't this an inappropriate sexual misconduct in the workplace by the President?
@RVAwonk @keithboykin Sorry I am still distracted over the sexual misconduct in the workplace this tweet by the President insinuates.
@4everNeverTrump I thought it was a way to hide his sexual misconduct in the tweet. He insinuated something you had to hide
@SocialPowerOne1 He needs an ethics investigation that tweet was sexual misconduct in the work place.
@joesmith323 @JenAshleyWright @SenGillibrand How did you interpret the Access Hollywood tapes? How would you interpret it if it was your daughter?  Just wondered.
@realDonaldTrump It's looking like this tweet has inappropriate sexual conduct by the President.

@naenae82575 @SethAbramson How about a different way? Can Melanie's citizenship be revoked for being part of the Russia anything? Can that be used to squeeze him to resign if a plea deal is reached w/Jared or Don Jr to testify she knew and we could revoke &amp; deport her if he doesn't.
@SethAbramson Could Don Jr also offer up if Melania had knowledge of Trump's criminal acts. Could her citizenship be revoked if she did? Then use that as leverage to force Trump to resign or we revoke &amp; deport her This would bypass Impeachment. I also wonder if her path was legal anyway
@100101010O10 @aspiritedpotato @MalcolmNance @PaulioScorchio @RobinBrenizer @LouiseMensch Very true but a good plea deal op for Jared he could offer up both of them and we wouldn't need congress to impeach if we could threaten to revoke citizenship and deport unless he resigns.
