We should reinvest the ideas of these companies into public transportation while expanding and regulating their service with accessible and high capacity vehicles, like mini busses on intelligent itineraries, pooling passengers along similar routes directly to their destinations. https://t.co/A4nqOoaauE
@elonmusk With 500k Teslas on the road, they don't represent more than 0.03% of the global automobile fleet. Thanks for your efforts, but to everyone reading: THIS IS HARDLY A SOLUTION TO THE DAMAGES OF TRAFFIC. We need to rethink car ownership and roadway travel https://t.co/KPqrfI8fpo
Traffic is the enemy of the people!		https://t.co/KPqrfI8fpo https://t.co/2z8IlCURhc
@drvox Traffic will never get better until the use method‚Äîowner:operator‚Äîis modified and we achieve efficient use of the machinery that forms it. Otherwise, owners will; operators will; traffic density will continue to increase. No other form of transportation can take place of a car.
@semajrabnud @drvox How about collective transportation with the flexibility of roadway travel, maintained and serviced by a regional transport authority?		Driving should become a utility, and instead of driving, travellers should be riding. 	 https://t.co/KPqrfI8fpo
In what the comic attempts to represent, throughout my day, I will appear as being alarmed, concerned, disengaged, and dismissive. I have no financially responsible option to stop driving. I hate it, but it's the same for hundreds of millions of people.		We can fix this.
Solutions need to be developed to service these needs more efficiently, rather than placing blame on operators while expecting them to simply modify the material conditions they are in debt to. Much of my argument for this is contained here: https://t.co/KPqrfI8fpo
The comic is somewhat disingenuous towards those stuck in traffic and forced to the pump. Most cannot afford to give up automobility once they have set their lives around it, no matter how alarmed they may become over surrounding effects. https://t.co/rzrpVKtEGa
We could make it happen all on our own, but we can't to do it alone 		Let's make traffic lighter together		Let's set a challenge to reduce traffic by 90%		Let's drive less and give the ride to more		Let's increase mobility and decrease its damages		Let's clean up this mess https://t.co/zc9QsxKV7O
@jamsmcgowan @GlobalEcoGuy You should take a trip to your local freeway sometime during rush hour and find out just how disappointingly wrong you are. 		Car owners aren't wealthy, and they aren't turning in their 2004 Odysseys anytime soon.		#techillusions
@djbelieve @MichaelEMann Of course we're mismanaging our resources. Waste is everywhere in our culture. Just look at how many cars we try to fit on the roadways after they've locked. We need large-scale, regional calibration of the tools we are operating. We could end traffic i.e. https://t.co/KPqrfI8fpo
@rev_stjohn @TrackBots Please see my proposal below on how this is a possibility for any city. City transit authorities need to take control of roadway travel and implement public rideshare utilities to minimize number of vehicles while maximizing travel for entire region. https://t.co/KPqrfI8fpo
@Roshan_Rinaldi Entire thing is clearly for Russian oil; trying to get back into the Caspian Sea through Baku, which was bought out by British Petroleum in the late 80's. Inspire Brexit to isolate British economy; set a pawn as president of, and buy out leaders of UK's closest alliance;  profit?
@PhoenixMetroBus @PhxTrafficAlert Make cars a public transit utility	https://t.co/KPqrfI8fpo	For any city, with a fully automated fleet of publicly shared vehicles, the reduction in required # of vehicles is between 77-90%, depending on carshare vs rideshare and the use of high-capacity public transport
The solution is to take the platform from them and develop it into a public transportation system with greater features for accessibility, luggage, and children. By expanding the program to service a metropolitan region, traffic can be reduced 77-90%. 	https://t.co/KPqrfI8fpo https://t.co/WWmRy7nI82

@TfLTrafficNews This would solve your traffic issues		https://t.co/KPqrfI8fpo
@Javiolomar This would solve your traffic problems 		https://t.co/KPqrfI8fpo
@IrritantCab @deanyb71 Well argued. You're certainly part of a real world conversation here, denying that by utilizing transportation capacities of vehicles to their fullest extent and repurposing vehicles for continual use, that traffic can be greatly reduced, because your imagination is out to lunch.
@IrritantCab @deanyb71 Do you mean this real world study that shows this to be the transit opportunity of the century? doi: 10.1787/5jlwvzdk29g5-en		That I reference in my proposal here https://t.co/KPqrfI8fpo		Which would effectively eliminate traffic and the habit of driving without losing transit
@IrritantCab @deanyb71 Either. A ridehail service doesn't necessarily need to operate in the way of Uber, producing miniscule wages for drivers and failing to vet those drivers for antisocial behaviours. A public agency would do better to screen necessary employment. Selfdriving machinery would be key.
@deanyb71 My full proposal, to date, is on my profile.
@IrritantCab @deanyb71 I mean Lyft on a larger scale, to service an entire region, effectively recycling the vehicles that form traffic, remaining them in service instead of packing the walls around us with hulking machinery, and sharing the space of vehicles more efficiently, to do us all a favor.
@deanyb71 Key study shown by pdf is here: https://t.co/TRKgiPIMpD	on page 19, with the prime conditions being a city that has high-capacity public transport‚Äîlike a railway transit system‚Äîand a 100% shared self-driving fleet, that for the given city, Lisbon, would need a fleet size of 10.4%
What is the #costofdriving for you? What could you do if you never had to drive, yet still got exactly where you were going? What would your world look like without #traffic and all of its damages? The solution is to utilize traffic as a system of programmed #rideshare. https://t.co/k9zhALHUcu
This is the #costofdriving. However, there remains no better mode of #transportation. It is the use method that must be changed to bring an end to congestion; by utilizing a public #ridesharing service with modern intelligence, traffic can be shrunk by 90% https://t.co/KPqrfI8fpo https://t.co/aunLZWsa5n

@grist @lacrepat We can't wait any longer for global leaders to pick up the slack. We need effective, regional action, now! All metropolitan regions can make tremendous reductions in emissions and pollution from #traffic by implementing public ride-hail programs. 	 https://t.co/r684k9VfXS

@Gidi_Traffic I'm trying to spread awareness of a solution at hand for #traffic. We don't need to #drive anymore. It would be faster and cheaper if we #ride together. With a Public ridehail service operating a #rideshare program, city traffic could be reduced by nearly 90%. See link in my bio.
@claudiomkd @chidambara09 We could travel faster, but can we fix the mess we've made with traffic?		Actually, yes.		https://t.co/r684k9VfXS
@ReggieVaitz Thanks #uber for showing us the way out of traffic. Now let's ditch this terrible company and get cities to start public ride-hail services. If implemented at the right scale and utilized as a #rideshare program, traffic could be reduced by nearly 90%. https://t.co/r684k9VfXS
