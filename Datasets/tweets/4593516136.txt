@tom2sl @reason I have no interest in ever owning one of these but I don't think they should be banned for the above reason-because it won't make a difference as long as the above conman household items are still legal.
@tom2sl @reason ...this information is widely available on the internet, (i.e. youtube, Facebook, reputable editorial websites, etc.)
@tom2sl @reason By pointless, they mean you don't need a bump stock to bump fire a rifle. All you need is a regular old AR-15 and either a rubber band, pants with belt loops, or good finger discipline. So it would be a waste unless all those things are banned too. BTW...

@KyleKashuv @ArianaLopez_MSD What's your opinion on the bump stock regulations that are supposed to come out soon that not only violate the right to just compensation for seized property, its just stupid policy in that these stocks are not needed to bump fire.
@gardebien @Uncle_Jimbo I completely agree. Not to mention its unconstitutionally, it is an extremely stupid an unnecessary law.
@Uncle_Jimbo Correction- "auto WEAPONS" not "auto WEAPOMS".
@Uncle_Jimbo I meant "machine gun", not "macho gun". Typo.
@Uncle_Jimbo ...and the worst part is that the first ever ban on law abiding citizens from owning a certain type of firearm was COMPLETELY UNECESSARY. As mentioned previously, at that time NOT ONE legally possessed automatic firearm was used to commit a crime.

@CBRhino1 @JackieEspinal4U @votevets An exception to Posse Comitatus is that the President may use the military to repel an iminent foreign invasion force. They may try to formally declare the caravan as a literal invasion, making potential military action against them not a breach of Posse Comitatus.
@TheTinaVasquez There is an exception to Posse Comitatus that they may try to use. The law grants Potus the power to use the military to defend the homeland from a foreign invasion force. Therefore, if he declares the migrants are a literal invasion, Posse Comitatus may not apply to military.
@DLind They may try to classify this as a literal invasion, thereby justifying military action on the border as protecting the homeland, rather than enforcing domestic law, thereby making Posse Comitatus not applicable. The President declaring a "National Emergency" was the first step.

@ecdski I hope they overturn the ban on machine guns made after 1986 because even before that, there were no crimes committed with legally possessed machine guns because they were already highly regulated.  That pointless law created bump stocks. Gun Owners of America is against it.

@LovesStangs2 @RonaldKlain The whole reason that bump stocks exist is because of the Hughes Amendment, attached at the last min to a pro gun bill to try to bring it down.  The amendment banned the civilian ownership of machine guns manufactured after May 19, 1986.  There was no debate on the amendment...
@Zykur_ @RonaldKlain In order to end bump firing completely, the government would literally have to ban rubber bands, belt loops, and yes...fingers.  The only thing this ban will do is hurt the law-abiding citizens who own the 500,000 plus (ATF stats) stocks.
@hotnostril @RonaldKlain Repealing the ABSOLUTELY UNECESSARY Hughes Amendment would fix the whole problem and would not infringe on anyone's rights.  Rather, it would expand them.
@white_Sas @DailyCaller @NRA I meant belt loop.
@white_Sas @DailyCaller @NRA There are over 500,000 of the stocks in existence according to the ATF.  Do you really think we should be banning an accessory from law-abiding citizens that can simply be substituted for by a common rubber band or a belt?  The ban is absolutely pointless unless it includes those
@KTBEEzer @TMarieBagley @AP4Liberty I disagree with his position on immigration but he is one of the most pro-2A candidates I have ever seen, openly calling for repeal of the NFA and Hughes Amendment.  We won't get many more chances to elect 2A absolutists so for this reason, I stand with @AP4Liberty.
@luke_osen @NRA @RandPaul Even better idea would be for every stock someone voluntarily turns in, they receive a credit for a free tax stamp for an NFA item.
@19JB60 @Unheard_patriot @AP4Liberty @GayRepublicSwag Do you support Josh Hawley who wants to take away 18-20 year olds right to bear arms and supports banning firearm accessories through executive order?

@Robert_Newell_2 @AP4Liberty @Andyrhondaluke @GayRepublicSwag @AP4Liberty  A member of congress introduced a bill to setup a crowdfund for private donations to fund the border wall.  Would you be fine with a privately funded wall if it was built on land that was voluntarily sold to the gov?

@RDA62 @AP4Liberty He does want border security but not a wall (for cost), which I disagree with.  He is however stronger on the Second Amendment than Hawley which is reason enough to support him.
@AP4Liberty @AP4Liberty has a more America First foreign policy than Trump, who has broken his promises on non-intervention.  Austin is also stronger on the Second Amendment and civil liberties.
@BrianCollinsMO @KyleKashuv @AP4Liberty Why do you support someone who wants to eliminate 18 to 20 year olds' right to bear arms and supports banning firearm accessories through executive order?  Austin has remained consistent on his pro-life, pro-liberty policies.
