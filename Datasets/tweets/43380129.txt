I've been revisiting @JessicaEStern &amp; JM Berger's book and came across a sentence that perfectly answers a question I often get about why #Iran isn't on the verge of collapse: Iranians look around them and think, "The only thing worse than a brutal dictator is mo state at all."
@sidhubaba @businessinsider @thisisinsider Congrats, Sid!
@rezahakbari Also true that many of these practices exist elsewhere. I've been fascinated as a "Yankee" to discover a number of weird similar cultural practices between Iran and the deep south (not in the northeast, where I've spent most my life)--where I've been traveling more.
Quick thing to highlight: IRGC commanders seem to be issuing statements of support for Zarif. Folks often think IRGC = monolithic &amp; hardline. That's not the case as this episode shows again. There are hardliners who wish to see Zarif gone while many within IRGC want continuity.
Reports indicating that Roubani hasn't accepted Zarif's resignation and other power centers are asking him to stay. Regardless of what happens next, here's my breakdown of what led to the resignation and the domestic politics at okay üëá https://t.co/2SMmmbBaTD
@DanielTavana One of my biggest pet-peeves in #Iran analysis circles is folks learn 3 Persian words and throw them around regardless of context and Iranian Americans play that game instead of elevating the discussion of culture in the context of politics. I'm sure I'm also guilty of it too.

@JBWolfsthal @jabdi * and can demonstrate that.
@JBWolfsthal @jabdi Indeed. And that can only happen if we aren't just rejoining for the sake of rejoining but because it still serves US national interest. Or else, we would just overturn the admin's policy for the sake of it (and we all know how that goes).
@jabdi @ilangoldenberg @BrewerEricM I understand. I agree it's important both for international partners and domestic reasons in Iran. I do think that if there's going to be a commitment at this stage, it should come with the caveat (the precondition) that it's if Iran continues implementation.
@barbaraslavin1 @jabdi @ilangoldenberg @BrewerEricM Poor choice of words on my part. Clarified what I meant in response to Jamal.
@jabdi @ilangoldenberg @BrewerEricM Let me clarify: I am arguing that absent all the info we will have in 2020, I don't believe it's wise to commit to a return to the deal. We don't have all the info needed for that decision yet and won't for a while.
@jabdi @ilangoldenberg @BrewerEricM I am not suggesting preconditions. I'm suggesting waiting to see how the situation evolves (will Iran still be implementing JCPOA by then, for example, before making that decision). I'll let Eric and Ilan answer about their position.
At the very least, I'd suggest a prudent policy would be to wait and see, 1. What happens in Iran's parliamentary elections; 2. Where we are in JCPOA implementation; 3. What broader dynamics are before making such a goal explicit.

While I don't fully agree with my colleagues @BrewerEricM &amp; @ilangoldenberg's new Foreign Policy article, I do agree that a return to the deal without any preconditions would be a unilateral concession.
@DNC seems to have adopted a resolution to reenter the #Iran deal. As most folks who follow me here know, I've been a supporter of the deal since its contours emerged. But I am concerned about this move by the DNC.

I also assigned chapters of Paret.
Quick update here: #Iran says it's conducted an operation uncovering several houses serving as the terrorists' base, arresting 3 operatives and removing 150 kg explosives ready for use and 600 kg explosives being made.
@PaliwalAvi @asfandyarmir @shashj Iranian officials have long complained about Pakistan allowing terrorists to go in and out and plan and execute attacks in Iran. So, I don't think it's that unusual (remember Iran sending a drones or two onto Pakistan and saying it was because it had to take matters in own hands)

Incidental, the @VP's proposal #Iran's hardliners' dream scenario: It'd allow them to win the public opinion war at home and internationally and to resume their nuclear activities unchecked.
If the deal falls through, Iran's program goes unchecked and it will expand, making it harder to turn back the clock later (we saw this in 2005). It would be a huge mistake to undercut the deal before securing an alternative.
By asking the Europeans to stop implementing #Iran deal, the admin is picking short-term political gains over our long-term security interests: It's further widening the gap with our European allies and undercutting key nonproliferation steps that are curtailing Iran's program.

@EmmaMAshford @NicholasAHeras Haha. What Emma said. I'll caveat with this: We obviously don't have a lot of good data on this. But my experience in Iran has been that the regime, Pahlavi, and the MeK are all unpopular with the MeK having the least support. Pahlavi benefits from some nostalgia for his father.

The context of the attack is pretty significant too: It's during the celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the revolution, during which #Iran has showcased its military achievements in a securitized environment.
Jaish al-Adl has become well-known in #Iran in recent years in part due to its kidnappings of border security agents in the Iran-Pakistan border region (Sistan-Balochestan). The group is a source of tension between Iran and Pakistan.
#Iran is linking the attack, which was perpetrated against IRGC ground forces, to "takfiris" (what we'd call jihadists). Jaish al-Adl seems to have claimed responsibility for the attack. The group, active in Sistan-Balochestan for a few years, was formed by members of Jundullah.
A suicide bomber reportedly targeted a bus and killed 40 IRGC personnel in #Iran's southeastern province of Sistan-Balochestan--one of the country's most underdeveloped and least secure regions. 		Jihadist and separatist groups have long tarted armed forces in that region.

So, unless we figure out how to deal with all these issues in a holistic manner and stop the wishful thinking of the regime collapsing any day now, we may very well see yet another conflict in the MidEast--miscalculation or escalation.
Takeaways? 		1. Only one of the Iran threats outlined by the IC is in check and that's the nuclear program thanks to the JCPOA, which the admin has walked away from.	2. All other threats are growing and so is the risk of conflict.	3. The regime is still not collapsing.
More unrest to be expected (though, the IC notes, they are likely to remain uncoordinated, "lacking central leadership or broader support."
Domestically, Rouhani has hardened his position toward the US to appease hardliners, which the IC assesses "will be emboldened to challenge rival centrists by undermining the domestic reform efforts."
Iran has refrained from poking the US in the eye in the Persian Gulf too much but that could change as Iran adopts a hardline. And although it hasn't done so yet, Iran could close the Strait of Hormuz in response to US sanctions.
In Yemen, Iran continues to supply the Houthis enabling them to attack shipping in the Bag el Mandeb Strait and against targets deep within Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
In key battlefields, particularly Iraq and Syria, Iran is turning its military gains into political and economic ones. Risk of conflict between Iran and Israel continues to grow, even as the IC estimates that Iran still seeks to avoid a major armed conflict with Israel.
Iran is still in compliance with the JCPOA but its cyber and missile capabilities are growing.
The intel community's 2019 threat assessment is here and a few things stand out on #Iran and here's what they mean.

@Swarthy_Bastard So true. What I've found interesting recently is the use of social media to communicate some of these same sentiments you're describing.
It's unsettling for Washington and Iranians to watch the Islamic Republic turn 40 in a few weeks and Iranians have certainly been yearning for profound change. But it's not clear that Pahlavi 2.0 is the change they want.
More fundamentally, should we sitting here in Washington be making these decisions for Iranians? And are we ready to pay the costs associated with being involved in such a process? Are these costs worth it (and we have a long track record to look into for the answer here)?
What matters is to ask a set of questions that help guide US policy: Are the opposition groups du jour sending Washington into a frenzy actually viable in Iran? If in power, would they change the policies we find problematic or do more of the same but with a fresh coat of paint?
... nostalgia doesn't make for a deep base of support, as Gregg put it. And the nostalgia isn't new. I remember being 7 or 8 and my friends reminiscing about the Shah's time. Of course, none of us were born then. But nostalgia or lack thereof shouldn't matter in our calculus.
A few thoughts here: Yes, there's nostalgia for the Shah's time in #Iran. But that's not unique to Iran, it's quite common in revolutionary states. I grew up in France, where more than 200 years after the collapse of the monarchy, there are still pro-monarchy groups. But... https://t.co/klHdCI4Xq5

Stubborn falsehoods continue to shape the debate around the #IranDeal. One that resonates a lot with the average anti-deal voter is the idea that United States gave Iran $150 billion--which, of course, is not what happened.
CNPC announced it's suspending its investment in #Iran's South Pars gas fields. Folks may be tempted to jump to conclusion that US pressure is paying off. Not so fast. This is China's MO in Iran, as @DEsfandiary &amp; I discussed in our book, #TripleAxis.		https://t.co/vBVamRTQ29

He noted this figure is lower than the UAE and Turkey (and, of course, Saudi). He said that a friendly country had spent $7.2 b on 36 F16s at 200 mil each. At 200 mil, Iran can produce 500 long-range missiles (some costing 100k and others 400k).
Finally, Hajizadeh discussed Iran's defense budget, and that allocated to some items -- to my knowledge, this is the first time an official has put a figure on Iran's missiles. Hajizadeh noted Iran spends $13-14 billion on defense (and compared this to neighboring countries).
Next, Hajizadeh talked about Iran's drone program. He noted that Iran's Shahed 129 had be aloft 24 hours in Syria and Iraq over terrorist positions, not only benefiting Iran's own forces but also those of Syria, Russia, and Hezbollah.
Although he acknowledged some misses on those strikes, Hajizadeh largely sold the strikes as successes demonstrating missiles' precision--reporting by some news outlets contradicts this. He noted 77 terrorist operations had targeted Iran this year, 75 of which were neutralized.
Hajizadeh said that a decade ago, Iran's missiles weren't very precise. Khamenei prioritized precision, leading to Hajizadeh's focus as commander of the force to developing precision. Hajizadeh took Iranian missile strikes against #ISIS positions in Iraq and Syria as examples.

@DEsfandiary I don't think the two are mutually exclusive since the admin's position is that the JCPOA wasn't "enough." I obviously disagree with the way it's approached the issue but I think acknowledging relevance while believing limits aren't enough are possible at the same time.
2 categories of #Iran sanctions exemptions are indicative of 2 important acknowledgements by admin: 1. Recognition of the relevance of the nuclear deal (Fordow + Arak exemptions); and 2. Iran's role in the region (Afghanistan and Iraq exemptions).
Reuters reports that Sec. Pompeo has granted an exception to certain sanctions to allow the development of #Iran‚Äôs Chabahar port. That's a positive development, that's as important for Iranian security as it is for Afghanistan.

@MorganCarlston Well, I don't think @kroenig is being dishonest. I'm sure some folks predicted Iran would jump in and ramp up its activities but I think most of our colleagues were more nuanced in their analysis.
3. Finally, the story you cite is misleading because it leads one to believe that Iran is now open to talks, when it wasn't before. Fundamentally, the Iranian position remains the same and Zarif has wanted to talk for a while, but domestic politics are a key factor.
2. Similarly, it's too early to tell whether the pressure is "real," if we define "real" as effective: We can pressure Iran all we want and could even starve the population. But if there's no change in behavior--all of it, as outlined by Sec. Pompeo--then, objective not met.
A few points I'd disagree with, Matt. 		1. Many, including myself and @ilangoldenberg, argued that #Iran would ramp up its nuclear program but not in the short-term as it seeks an agreement with the EU. It's too early to test that since we withdrew from the deal in May. https://t.co/uGwiIwKjnR
I understand the underlying point and you may be right on that but the post is misleading.

According to this Fars News reporter, Ahvaz attack was perpetrated by 5 operatives tied to "separatist groups." Given US rhetoric and policies geared toward supporting "elements within #Iran," expect more tensions between the 2 countries and domestic crackdown in weeks to come. https://t.co/ZSOovkIUDr
EU &amp; #Iran move forward to continue trade and preserve nuclear deal. 2 sides will highlight 2 different outcomes in days to come. Both can be &amp; are likely true at same time: EU will find it difficult to shield businesses from US sanctions, which it'll undermine in the long term. https://t.co/7L00hMZQZI
This is very accurate and among the many gaps between rhetoric and policy in #Iran. https://t.co/aRKEuTLCa3

@BahmanKalbasi It was in Pompeo's remarks, he said, "we are committed to a whole of government effort" and then talked about the IAG ensuring synchronization with interagency partners.
@BahmanKalbasi I thought he said both within State and interagency, as well as international?
Many will criticize #Iran Action Group--and I am skeptical that admin will get Iran back to table, leaving it w/ unrealistic regime change. One important objective and, in my view, much-needed aspect of IAG though is to coordinate inter-agency efforts on Iran. That's positive.
#Iran increasingly front and center of @POTUS foreign policy agenda. https://t.co/4rld6SpvLU
Sanctions experts in government and outside have tried to minimize these side effects of sanctions since Iraq. But in my experience, the med shortage and price hike is an area Iranians see as as either US either targeting or not caring Iranian lives to get to regime.
Those of us who traveled to or lived in #Iran during height of sanctions remember this well: Friends and relatives asking us to bring them medication they couldn't find or had to pay exorbitant amounts for. We're slowly getting back there it seems. https://t.co/PF5kdB3h72

RT @maxleveille: As always, excellent analysis from @ArianeTabatabai https://t.co/zDeOELKRHV
This is one of the most significant speeches by Khamenei in a while though it's slipping under the radar. It doesn't mean the end of the JCPOA, as he had already suggested the EU talks are the main objective currently, but this is significant domestically.
I wrote about this extensively during talks in @BulletinAtomic and @ForeignPolicy during the nuclear talks. See here (https://t.co/63DtxS9Xmo) and here (https://t.co/MaKJx5260t) for example of him slowly distancing himself from #JCPOA.
3. For first time, Khamenei directly targets Rouhani for signing #IranDeal and notes, negotiators crossed the redlines established (by him) during the talks. In the past, he'd criticized the deal but did so while shielding negotiators.
2. Whereas he'd normally lump US govs together, here he distinguishes between Trump admin and other governments, stating, even if #Iran were to negotiate with "the American regime," it wouldn't do so with the current admin.
3 significant things pop out in Khamenei latest remarks on #IranDeal, sanctions, #US-#Iran relations: 1. Normally, Khamenei portrays sanctions as opportunity (see here, https://t.co/mR8L1QDTrZ). Here, he acknowledged that they have negative impact on country's econ, a departure;

Clearly, hardliners are divided on the direction the country should be heading towards, but also the short-term: Consensus among them is that Rouhani hasn't delivered on his promises but division on what would be best, his finishing his term or ending it now.
And the infighting in #Iran continues: Ahmadinejad issues a statement asking Rouhani to step down. He's getting trashed on social media--by other hardliners!--saying he messed up big time but no one asked him to resign and he was protected by SL.

Soleimani clearly trying to deter US from escalating further, interestingly, seems to try to appeal to broader US security establishment to check the President, and rally international community and nation behind #Iran leadership. You also see more effort to present united front.
Soleimani says #IRGC Quds Force and #Iran asymmetric capabilities are what US faces not the whole of the Iranian armed forces and mocks the President's rhetoric, saying it belongs in "cabarets."
#IRGC QF commander responds to @POTUS and @SecPompeo, says US once had a certain status but not anymore; points to #Afghanistan noting US failed there w/ world backing and now seeks talks w/ Taliban, so it will fail in #Iran.

@yjtorbati Hence my second comment that the degree of implementation and enforcement remains to be seen especially as infighting increases with the talks with the Euros underway, the future of the #IranDeal up in the air, and domestic divisions.
If successful, this would help facilitate business as arrests of dual nationals in particular stymied return of companies into Iran after #IranDeal. But big question mark would be the degree to which the law would be implemented and enforced given increased infighting.
Indicative development in #Iran with majles considering a bill with support from over 70 lawmakers granting immunity to expats and dual nationals currently unable to return to Iran due to political charges against them (with exception made for those having caused physical damage)
If I were #Iran right now, I'd consider throwing out #IranDeal with all the detailed limitations on and monitoring of the nuclear program and negotiate a one-pager with President Trump modeled after #NorthKorea.
Since this is a thing again: #Iran at times helped AlQaeda by facilitating movement of operatives and transfer of money. Not news. We've known this for a while. This was tactical and predominantly aimed to protect Iran from the group (which Iran also sees as threat). https://t.co/kIpoIdvXDJ
Note the number of Chinese companies among the 8 major ones still ative in #Iran post US withdrawal from #IranDeal. https://t.co/58lZRNV0ay

We can and should think about how to respond to Iran's nefarious activities in the region but if you want to (as @SecPompeo and others have stated they do) to signal to Iranians US distinguishes between them and regime, this isn't the way. Long-term damage to US image in Iran /2
The regime's destabilizing activities in Syria and elsewhere will continue with or without limitations on their carriers. The average Iranian who wants to study or go spend a few days abroad to see loved ones or get away from restrictions, however, will see their life affected /1 https://t.co/nZTFxHCsFr
Anyone who's been to #Iran can tell you this is a recipe for disaster. This won't buy US appreciation among public. It's doing regime a massive favor by telling Iranians that the US is their enemy.

RT @S_R_Anders: Great thread/article on Iranian decision-making process re: JCPOA from @ArianeTabatabai. Underscores why we shouldn‚Äôt treat‚Ä¶
A key takeaway from the remarks lies in the constituency Khamenei was addressing: He reiterated several times that domestic voices calling for Iran to stop missile and nuclear programs are wrong and defended these activities by framing them as need for self-reliance.
@laurnorman @JoeBra123 Doesn't mean end of #IranDeal for now. In 2014, many thought this same statement meant collapse of talks. It didn't. Having listened to the whole thing, he specified that whatever preps would take place within #IranDeal for now.
Khamenei stressed reiterated his 2014 stated goal of achieving 190 SWU. But important point here is that he emphasized this would take place within #IranDeal context for now. As I argued, for now, Iran will continue to implement deal and won't take action rocking boat too much.
As I noted in @ForeignAffairs, Khamenei won't outline every detail of #Iran nuclear plan post-US withdrawal from #IranDeal. Instead, he'd set a framework. Today, he laid it out in his remarks. A couple of points: https://t.co/BmNrM05KA8

The trouble, of course, being that typically you want to think about implications and possible issues BEFORE you make a rash decision instead of winging it and waiting for #Iran to #TBT to 2012, when Arak and Fordow were moving ahead.
Let's recap: We pulled out of #IranDeal without serious Plan B and now, work to redesign &amp; convert key facilities may be halted by #China and #Russia, raising safety/ nonproliferation concerns. And the admin response is: brb, Working on it. https://t.co/EX6MyOicGm

If you're detecting trend between #Iran &amp; #NorthKorea developments, it's because one on several fronts: 1. US actions making other party look reasonable and US unreasonable and unreliable; 2. Sanctions being undermined; 3. Other major players no longer on board (#China, EU,...) https://t.co/nMdPgDPvlO
Also significant on domestic front, perhaps in response to growing hardline criticism of and push back against Rouhani on #IranDeal (see my @BulletinAtomic column below), Khamenei calls for unity and avoiding blame game. https://t.co/L9Ribj2X8K
This is slipping under the radar w/ #NorthKorea summit canceled but worth noting that #Iran continues to look like the reponsible party in all this as IAEA continues to verify implementation of #IranDeal nuclear provisions even as deal's future up in air https://t.co/Isl6JWeMt7
Cracks aren't just beginning to emerge, they've been part of #Iran-#Russia cooperation in #Syria for years. Keep an eye out for #TripleAxis, where @DEsfandiary &amp; I lay out the specifics of it. https://t.co/Cz3r616cNr

Anyone who was still under the impression that America's leadership is intact and that sanctions as an instrument of power will come out of this move without losing their efficacy should pay close attention to Europe right now.
Third, meanwhile, #China and #Russia are slowly but surely moving forward with #Iran. China's seeking to purchase oil from Iran in yuan and other projects are moving forward. Examples here: https://t.co/emTni54LQI; https://t.co/ZzKqbgJezL

I'm afraid no one is buying this anymore. Until JCPOA, that was both true and easy to sell.

Hence, smart move would've been to wait for Iranian noncompliance https://t.co/5RVxUo0MKA
The damage done by "winging" top national security priorities, which need careful examination and masterful planning, including the repeated signaling that the US is no longer interested in its traditional leadership position and allies, will take years to fix.

#Israel-#Iran tensions have been escalating in #Syria for weeks now and we may very well get to a boiling point. This would only exacerbate the already disastrous situation in Syria and open another front between two regional powers.
In the space of 24 hours, the Middle East has become even more volatile.

So, this should be a pretty easy "policy announcement": We are committed to nuclear non-proliferation and making sure that no state acquires nuclear weapons in breach of its international obligations. Here, I drafted it for you, @PressSec.
This is insane. We absolutely have a policy and it's not about #Iran or #Saudi, it's about preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons regardless of which NPT non-nuclear weapon state seeks them. Iran and Saudi are both non-nuclear weapon states under the NPT. https://t.co/Xt5hLozAAa

I just have to add this meme because it's a fave: It captures hardline grievances in #Iran. It says that Iran gave up nuclear in exchange for harsher sanctions and says, "Did you have to wait for your head to hit a rock [Persian saying] to understand US can't be trusted?" https://t.co/gRgLtJ8v8n

@TheNonproReview has provided free access to the #IranDeal special issue in light of the withdrawal yesterday. You can find my piece on what it took for #Iran to shape the deal and sell at home here: https://t.co/roeRDEnwVz
Echoing this. If you have any illusion that we have an #Iran strategy (and a viable one) and pulling out of deal makes sense, you will change your mind when you're done. https://t.co/X9Y8fvXC9n
The race for public opinion in #Iran has started following the US withdrawal from the deal with virtually complete focus on it by all news outlets. The EU can still help shift perception that it's either following US lead or ineffective by reassuring Iranians across the board https://t.co/dNQBsiI8Y6
President Trump's withdrawal from the #JCPOA doesn't just come at a cost for US credibility and non-proliferation, it even has an economic impact and goes against his major campaign promise of creating, "jobs jobs jobs!" https://t.co/RmexrUrgbU
Since Rouhani announced that his government is looking at its options for the JCPOA following the US withdrawal, we're likely to see a lot of these posts and memes, all striving to influence the decision and steer it away from working with the EU.
Finally, hardliners continue to push against any further negotiations. This meme says that every time Rouhani says he won't negotiate on the missiles, "my body trembles," since he may just be negotiating behind closed doors. https://t.co/uD71PPtFs1
Hardliners are also ridiculing the population for celebrating the JCPOA and putting its faith in the moderate government and the United States. As a reminder, people had come out and celebrated the JCPOA as they do soccer victories. https://t.co/uFNTZFkSj5
Next is the criticism of Rouhani for still putting his faith in the Euros and believing that the #JCPOA can be preserved despite US withdrawal. As I noted in the piece, they see the EU and the US as two sides of the same coin. https://t.co/R6WSGfNnBg
Several themes are emerging in #Iran's social social media accounts. First and foremost is: "We told you so." Hardliners are reminding the population and Rouhani government that they'd warned against trusting America. https://t.co/8EPWtchA8I

If the admin is indeed seeking to preserve #JCPOA and building on it to address other areas of concern re. #Iran, then @POTUS is taking steps in the right direction. https://t.co/ks7CjGQwmR
Pillars 1/3 make sense as part of this framework, including missiles (although it'll be a hard sell to #Iran). The regional stuff should be separate (absolutely something worth pursuing) as they should include and be led by regional parties to be viable. https://t.co/wMyLHj7X7d
Macron says #JCPOA isn't simply being torn without anything else, there's progress in that now both sides want a larger agreement based on 4 pillars. In principle, this is a good plan, but unlikely without JCPOA in place and continued implementation by all parties, including US.
@EmmanuelMacron proposes a framework built on four pillars in dealing with #Iran: 1. Short-term nuclear issue (JCPOA); 2. Long-term nuclear issue; 3. Missile activities; 4. Regional activities (such as #Syria). The last 3 would complement JCPOA.
President Trump threatens #Iran with "bigger problems" if it resumes elements of nuclear program limited by #JCPOA--continues policy of all sticks and no carrots. What incentive does Iran have to comply if US pulls out of deal or doesn't reissue sanctions wavers?
Agreed. There are some issues and at least one important point missing here (they were considering including it) but it's still a good piece. https://t.co/lf8ahetzO7

@MonteMallin @POTUS Pleasure!
Given its timing, this is an important report for Rouhani government, as it seeks to formulate a response to what seems like an imminent US withdrawal from JCPOA--potentially paving the ground for continued compliance if EU sticks to the deal.
3. Accordingly, the report highlights @IranMFA efforts to mitigate these challenges, including use of Joint Commission and bilats.
First, US allegations of Iranian violations despite the 10th @iaeaorg report verifying JCPOA nuclear implementation. Second, deadline for EU3 to change JCPOA provisions. Third, raising uncertainty surrounding JCPOA to prevent Iran benefitting from it.
2. The report indicates that US failure to uphold its end of the bargain has increased in the past 3 months, singling out 3 items:
The report also notes that despite uncertainty, Iran has seen relative stability of the economic opening created by JCPOA and of business, as well as some new investment and business contracts with foreign parties.
1. The report stresses that the deal's provisions, particularly on R&amp;D, sit within the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran's long-term nuclear development plans--thus allowing the government to keep selling implementation even as Trump admin undermines it.
#Iran government just presented 9th quarterly report on #IranDeal implementation to parliament--and this, as we wait for @POTUS to make a decision on the sanctions waivers by May 12. Here are the key points:

Folks who are pointing to double standards on nuclear programs in #iran and #Saudi: 1. Those programs aren't same, one was in noncompliance with internal law, not other; 2. #JCPOA provisions aren't meant as precedents to be applied by all nuclear newcomers, deal says as much.
I guess it's time for your periodic reminder that regime change in #iran isn't a sound or viable policy option.  https://t.co/Gr2r35YzWR
This is due to President Trump's back and forth on the #IranDeal, sending signals that he's not a serious negotiating party and increasing hardline pressure on Rouhani not to negotiate w/ US, an all sticks no carrots policy, and failure to maintain channels of communications. /2
Critics of President Obama's #Iran policy often point to his failure to get concessions from and lack of levers w/ Iran. But the failed attempt at negotiating on US prisoners in the country shows US has fewer, not more levers w/ Iran today. /1
@TeeAndersVolpe @DEsfandiary @ibtauris More broadly (outside the nuclear space), it actually can be traced back to the pre-revolution era too. Since the revolution, and especially post-sanctions, it's become a priority. In the nuclear realm, def since they resumed program in 80s.
Diversification of suppliers and partners has been a key Iranian policy for a while, driver behind nuclear talks. It's also a central piece of @DEsfandiary &amp; my forthcoming @ibtauris book on #Iran relations with #Russia and #China. Stay tuned. https://t.co/o7YRsMatXV

... In other words, Kamalvandi said that #Iran could decrease cooperation with @iaeaorg and has "the capabilities" to go back to pre-#JCPOA enrichment levels. Echoing what Salehi had said over the summer.
I want to clarify what Kamalvandi said about #IranDeal: he did note that #Iran would take action immediately in the days following US failure to renew sanctions. However, his list includes "options" at Iran's disposal not what it'll actually do (enrichment/ safeguards..) ...
