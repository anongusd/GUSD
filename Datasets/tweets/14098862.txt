@AlfRWallace There are no "brute" facts.  Evidence is "always" interpreted.  Truth is not determined by majority vote.
@AlfRWallace I think you are misrepresenting him.  He says that there is not enough for it to be settled science -Thomas Kuhn argues similar
@AlfRWallace That's what Mohler said in his article. You are saying the same thing.  Not sure why you are angry about what he said.
@AlfRWallace You draw a conclusion from evidence, right? And you "believe" you arrived a the right conclusion?
@AlfRWallace No, just curious.  How do you know something without believing it?
@AlfRWallace I don't think there is a reputable epistemologist anywhere who would agree with you. Where did you study epistemology/science?

@BenQahtaan There are also Spanish translations, and Arabic, and German, and .....
@BenQahtaan No, there is only one Bible; that is, the original autographa.  You are talking about English translations of the text.
@BenQahtaan The verse only has meaning when viewed in the context of the chapter.  What do you think the chapter is teaching? Now the Verse?
@BenQahtaan Not sure exactly what your point is.  The way we use language changes. That is why theologians study Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic.
