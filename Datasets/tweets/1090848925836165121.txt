@Bob_Janke @omgshuddup Congratulations on you popehood your royal popeness
@Givi70946563 @swilkinsonbc Thank you for your reply and thank you helping those that are not allowed to stand up for themselves and are imprisoned under a fascist regime.
@Givi70946563 @swilkinsonbc Exactly,it is small men's syndrome all over. It is because of the guilt the world feels for allowing what happened to the Jews that gives them the impedance to do the crimes to the Palestinians that they do. God sees, God will take revenge on those that haven't learnt.
@One_more_chptr @RSun82 Without love there is no life.
@unikgirl11 @Givi70946563 The Jews were treated brutality in the 2nd world war so how can they get away with treating the Palestinians with the same distain and hatred. God believes in a eye for a eye and God will get the justice for the Palestinians even if no one else will.
@swilkinsonbc @Givi70946563 When is the world going to stand up to the brutality the Israelis treat the Palestinians with. How dare the people of Israel not learn from their own history. How can they be allowed to imprison a whole race of people &amp; get away with it.God is going to hold them accountable,watch
@BetteMidler You are the moon Ms Midler.
@GOPChairwoman You idiot you are confusing socialism with social justice just because the republicans blet about it, it doesn't make it a reality.	 We are at an environmentally crucial period in earths history, just because you foolishy think there is no financial reward you lie to the public.
@jcj1000 Trump being putins bitch has terrifying ramifications. 	If they got together they could launch a world wide coup and could put the world into a dictatorship that we may never escape. 	Only trump being voted out in 2020 will stop this, if trump wins a dictatorship is a certainty.
@LindaMottram Hello Linda its very nice to meet you, hope you've had a nice day. 	Thank you for being a journalist it is people like you that keep the truth in the open. It scary how trump is trying to convince people that the honest media is fake it is the actions of a dictator.
@micklirish hi Mickey how are you today, I hope your well
@CherylDriver12 hello Cheryl its nice to meet you.
@RobertC50364977 @YouTube Hello its nice to hear from you, it is nice down here I think it only got to about 20c which is really nice. This is a walking fish very close to extinction. It was at Tasmanian seahorse world https://t.co/Y36s6CVxsf
@FuckThe_NRA @yogafan108 Fucking oath. The NRA and Republicans always blame mental illness and terrorism but guns are the one and only contributing factor.	This is why the democrats need to call on emergency powers when they take over the presidency in 2020.	Unless trump calls a emergency next election.
@KathyLGallaghe1 How gorgeous, I would love one of those little guys. No matter how bad your day is a little friend will always make you smile.
@Rebecca_Siobhan @Gupton68 In the playground I spent most of my days
@TomReagh Thank you for your service brother, I am Australian but I have great respect for all armed force personnel.	Freedom is not free and comes at great mental and physical cost to the few,for the many.	Thank God for all the soldiers who have made it to retirement	Intact&amp;safe
@SafetyPinDaily It is stunning that trump even considers taking money from real disasters to fund a made up disaster.	The people of  the US need to stand up on mass for these people who are genuinely in distress.	Trump love taking money from the middle class and the poor to fund vanity projects
@TomReagh @davidleecourt Yes I could drink more water thanks for the wake up call.
@047michelle @tanjung_sepat @MollyV178 The pig industry is a good analogy of trump and the Republicans, where they are the farmers and the US citizens and the world are the pigs.
@AustralianLabor @SwannyQLD Australia is genuinely the lucky country, sometimes our politicians are inept be we have never had anything as evil as trump and the republicans who are so racist and xenophobic that I thank God I'm Australian.
@AngryRaccoon2 hey angry I thought you might like this https://t.co/o9UnAvpU1C
@theheraldsun Although its not talked about as much violence against women, violence to men in a relationships is a real issue . It is often hidden because of the shame a man feels.We need to stop accepting any violence in relationships to either man women or children.Real penalties are needed
@abcnews @Debevoise @LindaMottram Australia needs to stick to auditable paper ballots, it would be impossible to rig enough paper ballots to win but with election. Electronic ballots are the ultimate tool for corrupt politicians and parties. They are the real signal of a potential dictatorship.
@LOLGOP @DavKat43 It is typical of an fascist government to play a game of cups with reality. The true problem is hidden under 1 cup the other two have nothing but hot air. You can never win cups you will always get the empty cup. Like the game the republican party is playing with US citizens.
@yashar My cat has been disguising itself as a bee to infiltrate the bumbles world, its part of her plan to take over the world. She has already installed trump into power he is actually 5 ginger cats standing on each others shoulder. You can tell this is true by his belligerence. https://t.co/cPyiaaTlkG
@AngelRae73 Merry meet to you
@Michael98940721 I will take your recommendation on advisement. I was thinking of bringing her to the US to see Dr Drew from celebrity rehab but she already has a smug sense of superiority and entitlement so I don't know if a TV doctor is wise it just might play to her ego. https://t.co/xlmDNjSmSH
@Michael98940721 The thing I worry most about is that she's getting addicted to hard drugs. When she was talking to me this morning she was slurring her words, suddenly she's talking with a lisp. What can I do?
@AngelRae73 hello Angelica its nice to meet you my name is Coray , I am a white witch
@Michael98940721 Good morning my friend, I don't know what to do, this morning Sita puss came home wearing gang colours I might have to have an intervention https://t.co/dcK8Igic1a
@RobertC50364977 @YouTube That's good to know I hope retirement is treating you well. God you wouldn't want to be in USA these days, I mean if he called building the wall a national emergency, whats going to be his next                       "emergency" his spray tanner made him to orange.
@stonecold2050 @UROCKlive1 The tax return is obviously less because of trumpy boys tax cut to his mates, how can a government function if businesses pay 20% instead of 35% it is the most blatant self enrichment by a democratic politician I have ever had the shame to witness.
@theheraldsun The motherfucking corrupt cop should be charged with conspiracy to murder, if 50 cent was caught doing the same thing he would already be in jail.
@Michael98940721 hello, how are you today
@ya_heba1185 @albekano_shivan Governments are going to be held accountable for their inaction on the refugee situation. I am ashamed of the Australian government. I do not understand how people in power watch adults and children be brutalised and they do nothing. Motherfuckers
@GrassrootsSpeak @embolina95 The collusion trump had with the Russians was learning how to loot a country and subvert the election system to corruptly and dishonestly keep power all things Putin is a master at. I fear for the good people of the USA.

@MaverickBistro @mishka1599 This is a very a incitefull statement, I hope people read it and think how they are writing their tweets, words out of context or misunderstood can do real harm and people need to take responsibility for the pain they may cause.
RT @MaverickBistro: People read tweets from their perspective and experience. I'm guilty of this too. Words have many meanings and context…
@deedragonhunter @BoiSmurfie Stupid sarcasm is the sign of an idiot. Intellectual wit is funny and hurts no one because real intelligence doesn't need to be stroked.Trump uses stupid sarcasm because he isn't intelligent enough to make a cohesive argument for any of his issues and he constantly needs stroking
@pippercat I believe purgatory is like rehab, it is a chance for spirits to right the wrongs in their life and then they get the chance to be reincarnated and then they can earn the right to go to  Heaven
@BoiSmurfie @ShellHasDragons Your doing excellent with " follows" you have three times what I have, people must be impressed with you and what you say. Keep up the good work. Be carefull of trolls and haters, as soon as someone puts you down or says something inappropriate block them immediately.
@BoiSmurfie @ShellHasDragons You stay awesome to little bro. I mean "little"with respect, I don't mean it to be condescending.
@BoiSmurfie @ShellHasDragons You to little buddy. Stand strong, study hard, treat girls with respect and you will be respected and people will want to be your friend because you are smart , fair and trustworthy.Laugh often,it is very imports to have a sense of humor it can get you out if tricky situations
@ExportedFromMI Trump is the most shameful leader that has gained power since Hitler, I know that seams extreme but when you look at the rallies, the hatred of Sth Americans, Mexicans,the wall, etc, it becomes quite obvious the path trump is taking America diwn.
@MaxineJayneBri3 Magnificent.
@RobertC50364977 @YouTube How are you both today, I hope the state of emergency doesn't mean you will be recalled into duty. I am praying hard for America it is a scary time to be a citizen with trump doing " dictatorship lite"
@BoiSmurfie @ShellHasDragons We all need turtle shells. Imagine you have got a turtle shell and use it to bounce of any criticism and protect your self from trolls and haters. An imagination is a wonderful asset. It shows a high IQ
@BoiSmurfie @ShellHasDragons That's a excellent prank, post more when you get them. Good luck at school I hope you do very well. I think you are clever enough to outsmart bullies. Keep up the good work little dude.
@albekano_shivan I am praying every day to God I tell God everything trump does I tell God about Isis and the Taliban. God is furious, because God knows that people are brutally killing and raping innocent men, women and children. Their day of Gods justice is coming. Allah Akbar
@albekano_shivan how can the world allow women and children to be raped and abused and the men to be executed and countries just let it happen and arseholes like trump separates children from their parents. Gods gonna get trump and the republicans
@laureldavilacpa America and the world needs more women like you that are prepared to fight for what is right. It is about time men stood up on mass in support. Women are the glue that holds society together. It makes me sick when I continually hear about women being assaulted
@AhmedAli97iq I wish I was in a position to help you. It is appalling the way the US is treating all Muslims as terrorist when they don't  understand that there is a lot of difference between Muslims from different  countries,  Every Muslim I have ever meet are beautiful people.
@Askthepoolman .....but she decided she wanted to get back in the cow but there was no room so the cow said she could live in her manure and lakshmi accepted this and from that time lakshmi/Sita lives in a holy cow pat
@Askthepoolman This is my cat Sita. Sita is a Hindu Goddess of good fortune and happiness. Its a funny story Lakshmi is Sitas avatar and all 200 million hidu gods live in one cow, Lakshmi decided that she wanted to leave so she left the cow and had adventures.... https://t.co/TSB1ir5lgu
@Askthepoolman That's funny in Australia we have bushfires but it is also a natural part of the natural cycle the Australian aboriginals use fire a lot for many reasons, some trees need fire to regenerate and will remain dormant for years till there is a fire
@Askthepoolman They are a secret code for different  herbs and spices
@Askthepoolman Yes I know this phrase "eye of newt" etc. Being a white white and shaman I don't harm any animal ever for any reason. How can it be good karma to kill something for a spell.
@Askthepoolman I am a vegetarian too, I am a white witch and a Buddhist so I believe all animals, birds and fish have souls of past people so I don't eat them because I am eating my ancestors.
@Askthepoolman Australia has a very fragile eco system our native animals are in great danger from introduced species like foxes, dogs, and feral cats introduced fish have overtaken some large rivers. Our wildlife has no natural defences from them
@Askthepoolman smooth newts are not native to Australia and pose a threat to native species because they predate on small native species. Their has been a population in Melbourne , Victoria. Its sad that such a nice looking creature is a danger but all introduced species are
@Askthepoolman Thank you for the follow.
@Askthepoolman A newt I have sort of heard of them before, do they go in water. Newt is a funny word when you say it a couple of times.
@Refugees All these 5 countries have terrorist groups like Isis the Taliban etc they have a genuine reason to seek safety we as a society have to open our borders to these terrorised people. God is watching. God will treat us and judge us as we do to others. That is justice

@kimlockhartga another person tweeted they had seen a live birth I tweeted the wrong response sorry
@WildCathRN Its nice to meet you Cathy,I am the good witch Coray or Beetle.I am right with God. The God I believe in is all powerful not the genocidal, homophobic, racist god of most religions. God is neither male or female to say it is either is creating God in our image
@pippercat I believe purgatory is like rehab it is a place where you are given a chance to find yourself and if you can find a host that will accept you you get on the reincarnation cycle until you can earn the right to go to heaven it might take 1-1000 lives to achieve this.
@pippercat Heaven	Reincarnation	Purgatory	Hell		Jesus.                     Satan	Love.                        Hate	Karma.                    Karma	Reincarnation.       Purgatory	Heaven.                    Hell		These are the two paths we can take, this is religion boiled down to 10 words
@kimlockhartga That must of been amazing ,I have only seen it on TV, the seahorses in the Tennessee aquarium might have come from the Tasmania farm, maybe next time your there you could ask them

@SkaneCanyon They are they look and act like blades of grass
@SkaneCanyon I know its weird but the Japanese are know for their love of seafood like sponges and sea urchins all which look disgusting but they think are delicious
@pippercat hello Piper it is a pleasure to meet you .I am Coray or Beetle Heartbreath the white witch. I am a Buddhist and I believe that some souls don't find their host and they are the "ghosts" you may be looking for

@tanjung_sepat no they definitely don't get eaten they are a protected species in Australian waters. They are farmed so that people leave the wild ones alone and for the pet and aquarium industry they  go for between $40-$100 each https://t.co/qUVNqN0eiW
@SkaneCanyon I hope you like these videos, and yes they are endangered and vulnerable to habitat destruction because the some reefs are dying because if global warming so the lose both their hiding spots and their food. That is why this farm exists. https://t.co/yrOBQsrxzH

@SkaneCanyon Animals never cease to amaze me. Have you seen a crow use a tool to get food that is otherwise out of reach or a monkey doing the same thing , putting a stick into a ant nest and they climb onto the stick and the monkey eats it like a lollypop. Animals are infinitely interesting
@Lady_Star_Gem @ListenToEzra Its because of these morons that refuse to vaccinate their kids,not because the don't believe the science, but because they don't like being told what to do. Their children should be band from schools. Their ignorance and arrogance is staggering.

@SkaneCanyon I think 4 chipmunks would equal a koala, I will trade with you. The chipmunk I saw was trying to fit a unshelled peanut and it didn't fit so it kept taking it out of its mouth and turning it around and it tried and tried it was not going to give up. So much dedication.
@kimlockhartga Hi Kim how are you today. That was a fascinating article you posted, I love things to do with outer space, especially when there is those amazing pictures that the Hubble and other orbiting telescopes take.
@girlsreallyrule @h0n3y_73 What are you talking about.The trump administration is falling apart. They are not kicking arse they are coming out of an arse. The national emergency is the disgraceful action of a petulant child that has to gets its own way or turns over the furniture.
@EyesOfGreen73 hello it is very nice to meet you ,I am the good witch Coray or Beetle Heartbreath. If you see a black crow that is me adoring you from afar. The crow is your spirit animal.
@SkaneCanyon I would love to see a picture of them  going through an obstacle course. I wish we had them in Australia they are I think the cutest animal around, I love how they carry nuts in their mouth, I saw a video of one trying to fit a peanut in its mouth, it was hilarious.
@RyanAFournier Are you fucking joking, little trumpy loves to incite violence and his supporters are becoming like the crowds at Hitlers rallies and his emergency order proves trumps want to be a dictator
Hear is a video from the seahorse farm in Tasmania Australia https://t.co/4Ro1X3SaMK

@KamalaHarris @RachelBogan3 How can trump be so ignorant of historical events. The Chinese built a 5000 kilometer wall that had guard towers every few hundred meters with tens of thousands of soldiers protecting it yet they still got invaded by the mongols. Learn from history don't repeat it.
@mascott04 hello my name is Coray,  it is very nice to meet you, I hope you are having a nice day.
@mbtmom2000 @BamaGal_inTexas @LisaSimpson24 @CrimsonKristy @mascott04 Bloody autocorrect
@MollyJongFast The fact that that cunt pence isn't allowed to be alone with women says so much about him. If his wife can't trust him why should anybody in the  always great USA. Trump saying he is trying to make america great again is denying the fact that America has always been great.

@DailyCaller @JessieJaneDuff Trump and the republican party are trying to bring in a voting system that only white Christians vote in it is obvious that the rules are to stop blacks and Latinos from voting, the land of the free my arse.
@Education4Libs @JessieJaneDuff Bull fucking shit Obama was trying to genuinely help people trump is just trying to help himself and his mates. Isn't it interesting that he wants to build a steal and concrete wall, two industries he has worked with all his life. Corruption at its most brutally obvious.
@aprildeming @SilERabbit @jfredfern Try republican run, fox network is the most decisive, racist xenophobic media outlet since gobbel and Nazism. You should hang your head in shame for allowing fox to fester and polite the world.

@EdKrassen @marshalotis @ChuckGrassley @marcorubio @JohnCornyn @SenatorCollins @SenRonJohnson @senatemajldr @lisamurkowski They are quiet because the wall enriches them and their cohorts, one day the republican party will be treated as the criminal organisation that it is.

@FullDarkPros hello its very nice to meet you, my name is Coray or Beetle Heartbreath, I am a white witch
@yourmusicsucks Have you read any Terry Pratchett, I think I spelt his name right, they are hilarious and hugely imaginative.
@ChiaraYoung2 Thank you. I often dream of a world full of love and peace for animals and nature as well as humans and it gives me hope when I meet people like you
@yourmusicsucks I will I spend a lot of time watching comedies or listening to music. Laugh is hugely therapeutic
@ChiaraYoung2 Thank you for taking the time to pray for the precious creatures. Alot of Australia has been in drought condition are just right for bush fires and koalas get caught in it as they are quite slow moving, often when there is a fire their is footage of a koala being given water .
@ucbendover thanks for the like, have a nice week my friend
@yourmusicsucks I wish you a happy day Sheila
@ChiaraYoung2 .in some parts of Australia there has been droughts, in some places for years. There has been convoys of trucks with donated hay and animal feed. Australians look after each other, we have our issues with racism and other issues but generally we live in a fair and caring society
@ChiaraYoung2 95% of farmers treat their animals well because they know that a happy healthy animal is a profitable animal.
@ChiaraYoung2 Yes their has been a huge outcry after video footage showing the sheep in real distress and being thrown overboard while alive, they don't have easy access to either food or water. I too only watch enough to understand the issues without overburdening myself.
@ChiaraYoung2 It is actually amazing when you think about it, imagine the power you could focus on healing if you could harness the  latent power of all those atoms combined
@ChiaraYoung2 Sorry I forgot to say thank you for taking the time to explain it to me
@ChiaraYoung2 That sounds awesome it reminds me of reiki, I hope I spelt that right. We have trillions of atoms in our body so I can see where and how you can get the energy from
@ChiaraYoung2 what is touch wisdom? please.

@ChiaraYoung2 Yes it can be true for certain animals in certain places our average summer temp is between 25 to 35degrees celcius,  most animals have adapted to Australias temperature long ago. We have a problem with live sheep/cow importing there has been horror stories and video proof of it
@ChiaraYoung2 Thank you

@paraseekersuk I am glad you are respectful to the spirits, they are lost souls who need guidance to help them find their host
@Gragrl if I not prying may I know your babies name so I can mention it in my prayers
@ChiaraYoung2 My pleasure it only takes a minute but it might have long lasting effects so its worth it. To pray just for yourself is selfish. To pray for others is rewarding to your soul
@ChiaraYoung2 its really nice to meet you too. Yes Australia can get very hot its not unusual to reach 45 degrees Celsius in summer. Nearly 2/3rds of our country is a red dessert.
@ChiaraYoung2 I wish you and your family great happiness and good health. I will say a prayer of protection for you all

@MichaelTrying thank you for your like it shows you have an independent mind
@MichaelTrying I am a humanist too. I believe god was created in our image and Jesus was killed because of our sins and not for them. It is horrendous that billions of people think that one good man must take the weight of their sins. The bible is the way to hell not heaven

@TheLoyalO @axidentaliberal All the stuff trump is doing is absolutely going to come back. The american people are mostly just and fair and they will come to see the corruption and immortality of trump and they will do something about it next election.

@RoKhanna @Rosie Saudi Arabic record on human rights is evident in the fact that women only got the right to drive in 2018 over 100 years since cars were invented. He will face his god Allah one day and he will be held to account. No God tolerates murderers especially ones that are protected
@pack2160 @sainttoad @justdawn_ @NatashaBertrand Its literally criminal in the highest sense. One day they are going to be held to account, trump is his own worst enemy as he can't help but brag and he forgets what he says do he always let's the cat out of the bag. Criminals always get court. Their day in court is coming.
@SkaneCanyon I think god run out of ideas so he just put together an animal from a duck, an otter and a chicken. Its poison is not deadly to humans but its incredibly painful and causes a lot of swelling. Its a very interesting and beautiful animal though qvery rare to see one in the wild
@SkaneCanyon No their not poisonous but we do have platypuses and they have a beak like a duck and a tail like a otter and have venom in their spurs in their hind legs they also lay eggs. When the English fist discovered them and sent them back home they thought it was a scam animal.

@SkaneCanyon We don't have chipmunks in Australia but we potoroos which are like a tiny kangaroo. Its good to know the chipmunks have a benevolent king. Hail Skane the chipmunk king. You should be given a seat at the united nations as the representative of all mammals.
@GunReformRyan thank you for your like and thank you for being on the right side of history. US gun control is absolutely vital and those that are fighting for it are hero's. Guns are the problem and cause of mass murders, not mental illness, not terrorists, not immigrants.
@SkaneCanyon its nice to meet the God of chipmunks,
@GunReformRyan Hello Ryan.	The only arms we have a God given right to have are the ones that swing from our sides.
@washingtonpost When people in power can justify the horrendous murder of a journalists its the beginning of a dictatorship. When trump courts murderers like nth Korean leader,Saudi Arabian prince and Putin it is time to be afraid and stand up against a potential tyrant.
@jihadwatchRS @PoliticalIslam That's bullshit Trump is the aggressor and its his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal that is the cause. It is dishonest and inflammatory to blame Iran for US racism and religious vilification. If Iran was christian  it would be protected by US instead of attacked. Fuck trump.
@PolitixGal Because of mechanisation there are actually 2/3 less jobs so a pay rise doesn't tell the real story. Its not trumps victory its Mr Obama's victory. Trump is taking credit for the jobs that were created because of the polices that Obama put into place
@baratunde @DebraMessing @rocunited Working for tips is modern day slavery. I live in Australia and our workers and unions would never tolerate the exploitation of employees in such an obvious way.
@NBCNews My condolences to the dead officers family. It is always sad when an officer loses his life in the line of duty
@GunReformRyan The wall is stupid look at the history of the great wall of China it didn't keep the mongols out and that wall is about 5000 kilometer and it was guarded with tens of thousands of soldiers, with manned guard posts ever few hundred meters, ladders will be hot sellers in mexico.

@Msgargoyle13 @Seajay603 @jacksnowknows Gods gonna get little donnie trump, that is absolutely guaranteed. He may be pulling the wool over US citizens but God knows all and is furious with him.
@4everNeverTrump @realDonaldTrump How did trump get away with such a massive conflict of interest by lowering the tax rate for him and his friends. It is so corrupt that its unreal that he hasn't been held to account
@realDonaldTrump You have got to be joking little man you want to waste 30 billion on a useless wall that people will only need a $30 ladder to foil. You owe the American people for that are you going to pay it or are you going to declare bankruptcy again you conman. Gods gonna get you little don

@DavidPiepho thank you for your like I appreciate you for taking the time to reply
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump The assault on your nation is being committed by trump and its people like you that allow the corruption to fester.
@CNN What an arsehole, what kind of world will it be when we can justify a murder by a prince. Murder is murder and all should face a court and be held to account.
@realDonaldTrump Bullshit. We know what you are up to little donnie. We know you are having rallies to onsite violence and to steal the election but disputing the results. Gods gonna get you little man. We know you meet Putin and the Russians to learn how to loot the country. You d-day is coming
@kashthefuturist @JGrobicki This device is frightening it will allow people to erase evidence, it should be band. Trump will be the first purchaser
@Alyssa_Milano @DivineCC Thank you Alyssa for your social consciousness. Its people like you that gives hope. Guns are the problem not mental illness not terrorists, they are the scapegoats that are used to hide the truth.

@CNNSitRoom @MalcolmNance @RepSwalwell He's like a child who's face is covered in chocolate but who denies eating it
@DonaldJTrumpJr @johncardillo What bullshit you are trying to flip the script by deflecting the truth about you onto someone else. The more you protest the more people see your dishonesty. The press is the only thing that stands between you and the dictatorship your father wants to install.
@UROCKlive1 America would starve without immigrants. Mexicans do the farm work Americans don't want to do. They should be applauded not vilified. But corrupt governments need a scapegoat to distract from their crimes
@sarahkendzior thank you for being a light in the darkness. America needs more people like you. Real truth seekers will always win in the long run. Lies can only stay hidden for a short time, and trumps lies are so see through its sad
@realDonaldTrump Bullshit, you and your family have admitted collusion you are going to face charges one day little man. And then you will have to face God. You live with the dillusion that you are god. Holding a bible isn't gonna save you. Gods gonna get you Donald. Its 1 minute to midnight
@BombshellDAILY @sarahkendzior It says everything about trump and his cohorts that they think nothing about taking children from their families. It shows his complete lack of morality and honesty.
@DropsNoPanties thank you for your service. Trump pays lip service to soldiers but real people recognise the real hero's in today's world. Best wishes to you and your family and your brothers and sisters in the armed services. God loves soldiers as it understands the sacrifices
@Loudwire Billie Eilish is a incredible talent who's music belies her young age. She is very unique in an industry that relies on sexualizing women to sell records. Let's hope she will inspire girls to follow in her steps that relies on musicianship and skill rather than sexuality

@DropsNoPanties @mjs03093641 https://t.co/s2V3NUFCOF
@DonaldJTrumpJr Jake Tapper is a fair minded honest journalist and that is why you hate and vilify him. It is because he is exposing the dishonesty of the trump family and its connections.
@NBCNews What an arsehole, typical of the rich they think nothing about not paying wages and trump has a long record of doing just that and because he has given himself and his mates a huge tax cut he has to withhold wages to balance his budget
@UROCKlive1 Trump courts Putin because he is learning from him how to loot a country and get away with it.
@RealOmarNavarro @realDonaldTrump Bullshit it has been shown over and over again that the wall won't stop anything and that's its just a vanity project for fuckface trump

@dailytelegraph I am so happy to hear that you Cooper have been able to return to the sport you love thanks to the amazing medical team that saw to you, God bless all the doctors and nurse that looked after you. And congratulations on not giving up but jumping into life, you are a champion.
@RodneyClaeys @ellievan65 He's probably doing it consciously so he can repay trump for his huge payrise since trump tax cut for the rich he probably thinks if he can help trump to win next election he and his billionaire friends will be financially rewarded again.
@ComedyCentral Absolutely awesome, what joy what exuberance, dogs can always surprise people, they have real personalities and if you take the time you can see and understand them. Then it becomes a really rewarding relationship for both owner and dog.
@Texas_Dexter How beautiful, if only people would understand they are just an animal they would realize that we can live harmoniously with the other animals, we could see their worth in them being alive and not in terms of meat. Animals have souls it is ignorant to deny this.
@MikeDelMoro Bullshit, everybody that has ever been investigated believes the Police, FBI, NSA are on a witch hunt. It is the first reaction of a guilty person and Trump and family are reacting in this way. Policing agencies don't have the resources for witchhunts. Face your demons cowards.
@RoArquette The only arms we truly have a God given right to is the ones that swing from our sides. Cowards have and collect guns. They are weapons of war and they take no responsibility for the carnage they are causing, over 52 mass shooting this year alone. Guns are the cause.
@HillaryClinton @QuancyClayborne Women's day in the sun is fast approaching, once the old guard leaves the political arena women will quickly dominate key posts and the balance of power will shift and they will be able to make sure they write new laws that protect them in a serious way with serious consequence's
@washingtonpost Trump fears dogs because they have independent minds,  he knows he couldn't control it and for trump its all about control he would feel like the runt of the litter and the dog would dominate him and america would have a dog for president in a stunning coup by rover the dog
@dbongino @jstines3 Bullshit
@sahluwal What an arsehole. Doesn't he realize the hell gay children go through. Society doesn't  understand the huge psychological damage caused to children who its about identity not sexuality. Adults minds go straight to thinking about gay sex the moment the hear someone identify as gay
@jordanwfisher_ They don't like you because they fear you.
@TrumpsareNazis @QuancyClayborne Wanker
@EqualityAu @SenatorWong @minus18 @Change @RichardDiNatale @Louise_Pratt @drkerrynphelps @nicheholas It is ridicules that people don't understand, just because these children identify as gay it doesn't mean there is a sexual element to it. For gay children it is about identity not sexuality
@rosemcgowan Hello Rose I hope things are going well for you, sexual assault is a hard thing to remove from your day to day life, its effects are long lasting and debilitating so I have great respect for you and the fight you have taken on, I will be sending you good thoughts and wishes
@DonaldJTrumpJr How many black Americans have been assaulted and harassed because of your fathers obviously racist comments. Gods gonna get you, just because you hold a bible doesn't mean Gods on your side
@DonaldJTrumpJr D trump is the one that is gas lighting america. We see your game, society is not as stupid as you would like to think, you are the stupid ones for not seeing the greatness that was always there
@BombshellDAILY Trump is going to deny the outcome of next election and is not going to give up power rather he is going to incite violence then use it as a pretext to retain power
@wouterhoetink Just because the earth may be greener its not an indicator of wellness, trumps policies are going to increase global warming hugely
@UROCKlive1 @SteveScalise It is not antisemitic to critize a regime that imprisons the Palestinians and puts sanctions on them, how can society ignore this glaring hypocrisy, how dare they not learn from their own history.
@SteveScalise Shouldn't then trump be removed for his continual racist comments?
@JakeJarvisWV He looks like a turd with a red hat on
@realDonaldTrump You are a liar you constantly incite racial hatred, you only support groups when it is suits you. You don't even know why there was a civil war idiot

@johncardillo Hitler had tens of thousands at his rallies and look how that turned out. Crowd size is not an indicator of righteousness
@sarahinthesen8 What the Australian government is doing is genocide. These refugees will never be accepted into the wider society of these islands so they will not procreate enough to keep their culture and religion alive.

@tanya_plibersek Thankyou for seeing these human beings as human beings and seeing the similarities rather than the differences, every parent wants the best for their children and wants to take them from dangerous countries where the murder of their whole families is a real possibility
@TonyAbbottMHR By customers you mean the people that are fleeing murderous regimes and are looking for hope for their children. You are worthless and your views are not worth listening to, you will lose the next election gauranteed
@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump You are stupid and selfish. You care just for yourself and your white friends and use any excuse to get your way, you are the schoolyard bullies of the world
@SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump Most socialist countries fail because the USA imposes sanctions so they can't succeed because it goes against your financial interests
@SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump Socialism is about looking after your people and making sure they have food shelter and medicine, what is wrong with this? Just because you are not making a profit on something doesn't make it bad or antidemocratic.
