@Sarah_SKG_1983 @NancyPelosi might be thrilling you with this bs wall battle, but her #PayGo plan &amp; failure to address climate catastrophe is an unmitigated disaster.  Her love of donor cash is greater than her 'concern' for the American people or this country's future.

@TrollofReason @commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer The GOP has been after the postal service since Dubya Bush.
@BravenakBlog @TheGeoffey @ColoKare I've been listing off things that went on before Trump that are evil &amp; immoral.  Trump only makes it worse if there's already an apparatus in place to enable that.
@Imnotbovvered @LarrisonAndrew @Linda65542703 @commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer The n word is used regularly in films.  Trump's fault?  Obama was deporter in Chief before Trump.  How about the disproportionate amount of PoC in jails?
@Imnotbovvered @LarrisonAndrew @Linda65542703 @commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer You didn't prove anything.  So Muslims weren't assaulted before Trump?

@Imnotbovvered @Linda65542703 @commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer What?
@Imnotbovvered @LarrisonAndrew @Linda65542703 @commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer You're a child if that's what you took away from that.  Did cops kill PoC before Trump?  We're PoC shamed for their languages before Trump?  We're people denied housing only after Trump?  GTFO it's worse.  Worse than what exactly?
@Linda65542703 @Imnotbovvered @commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer I've always seen it out in the open.
@Imnotbovvered @Linda65542703 @commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer You know that already &amp; I'm not questioning your experiences.  You say it's worse it's worse.  To me, what was before Trump is just as evil as what came after &amp; it's every bit as pernicious.  I think on that at least we can find common ground.
@Imnotbovvered @Linda65542703 @commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer What you see as increased was always there.  That's my only point.  Voting Democrat (which is how this got started believe it or not) won't make racism go away or magically put those people back on a closet.
@Imnotbovvered @Linda65542703 @commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer I think miscommunication is happening here.  I love different cultures &amp; diversity.  As a white man, racism has happened to me but not on the level of my friends who aren't.  I've seen racism in action &amp; I'll fight to oppose it in every form.  I have friends who suffer racism.
@TheGeoffey @ColoKare @BravenakBlog Again with the effing grammar Nazis lol.
@TheGeoffey @ColoKare @BravenakBlog How are you even drawing that conclusion?  Because I'm white I can't be aware of racism or how bad it is or how it affects communities?  Are you shitting me right now?
@commiegirl1 @Imnotbovvered @Linda65542703 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer You suck at manners, you instigate name calling, say a vote for anyone but a Democrat is hurting PoC, go to your followers when I take exception with it by asking your followers to pile on.  Your actions are more bot like than mine.
@Imnotbovvered @Linda65542703 @commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer Are you for real right now?  You don't want me to be colorblind &amp; love everyone equally?  Maybe you have the problem.
@commiegirl1 @Imnotbovvered @Linda65542703 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer There you are!  I was wondering when you were going to pop back up to say something stupid but I didn't think you'd go grammar Nazi with it.  You must be so proud to only be able to rebutt with spell checker!
@TheGeoffey @ColoKare @BravenakBlog Two people on Twitter doesn't constitute the entirery of American person's of colours experience.
@TheGeoffey @ColoKare @BravenakBlog I mean seriously!  I can c a lifetime of hate and racism, seen black men beat in Tennessee as a boy by the Klan, or even today but u dudes are mad over semantics.  I've experienced racism through them.  Again, if we can't have grown up discussions about this, it'll never change.
@TheGeoffey @ColoKare @BravenakBlog My dude, my experience with racism as a white person is non-existent.  I have friends of colour.  They face racism everyday &amp; have for decades.  Now, again, if racism already exists &amp; is bad, has been for generations, how is it suddenly worse in the last 2 years.
@Imnotbovvered @Linda65542703 @commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer By saying racism is a thing I'm showing white privilege.  Got it.
@zzyzyvasmay Might want to actually read them all then cuz it's all true.
@TheGeoffey @ColoKare @BravenakBlog Look, my real life experience tells me that the same level of invective &amp; hate &amp; what not has always been woven into the social fabric of America.  You're suggesting simply because Trump, it's worse.  How can racism be worse than racism?  It's all effing racism!!!
@Imnotbovvered @Linda65542703 @commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer By the by I don't note my friends by skin colour but the content of their character.
@Imnotbovvered @Linda65542703 @commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer How can racism, if it already exists/existed be worse than itself?  I hate racism &amp; racists.  All racism was &amp; is bad.  You say it's worse, to me that same level of hate was&amp; is there, just more people are awake to it now.
@TrollofReason @commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer You forget Obama's Grand Bargain where he was going to cut SS &amp; Medicare but the GOP stopped him.
@MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer Sir, if you'd read the tweet I wrote, I'd feel better voting for you if... Not that I wasn't voting for her; that's what everyone jumped on.  I just went with it. I'm 50 &amp; if you presume I don't know when to hold my nose when I vote you're pretty silly.
@MightyPrytanis @1StrongBlack1 @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer I'm a real person who's worried about health care.  All this anger &amp; hate &amp; name calling is from you guys.  Not one of you has been nice.  You're shitty people.  I don't care about that but I do care about millions of people without health care.  The system is broken.
@davidkelley718 @commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer Lol I vote &amp; fight for what I believe in too.
@Kalarigamerchic @ColoKare @BravenakBlog It's all bad.  But it went on before.  You may not remember when Lansing allowed Nazi &amp; Klan rallies, but I do.   Those people who voted for Trump already had platforms &amp; followers &amp; controversies but they were all ignored by all of us until Trump got elected.
@ColoKare @BravenakBlog So as someone who has seen racism in action throughout a life, fought side by side with PoC in the army &amp; on the street because of it, you're suggesting I can't say racism is bad in this country or I can't understand, empathise or discuss it with other PoC? GTFO.
@Kayface77 @BravenakBlog Lol look lady, racism existed before Trump.  It isn't worse because all racism is bad.  The lot of you trying to convince me otherwise is pretty mind blowing.  Perhaps if you had followed how all this got started, you wouldn't be talking out of your ass now.
@Kayface77 @BravenakBlog Still waiting for someone to give me proof of this.
@KoriWasinger @BravenakBlog That's what I've been trying to say.  It's all unacceptable.  But trying to suggest it wasn't there before Trump is stupid.  America has a lot of racists.
@mollylyons @ColoKare @BravenakBlog Look, I didn't start this.  I can't believe the shit I'm taking for saying racism existed alive &amp; well before Trump.  This all started when a Whitmer's supporter said I was harming PoC if I didn't vote Democrat.  She then asked her followers to pile on me.  This is one result.
@BravenakBlog @ColoKare Well maybe you shouldn't have started this conversation with me then.  I'm not arguing racism, I'm wondering why you're trying to tell me it was all nothing before Trump.
@BravenakBlog @ColoKare Well I don't know what special place you live where you never experienced that sort of racism.  That isn't my reality.  I fail to see the difference before or after Trump.  It's always been bad.
@Kalarigamerchic @ColoKare @BravenakBlog They did that before.
@BravenakBlog @ColoKare They did that before too.
@ColoKare @BravenakBlog I see what you mean about the racists acting out more but my reality growing up to this day is that PoC have always been repressed by the white power structure.  This is strictly observation &amp; concede I could be wrong.
@commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer Romneycare was a giveaway to insurance companies &amp; was too vulnerable to repeal, which Republicans exploited.  I'm happy your brother was saved but my concern is for the millions who still aren't covered or people going broke because no one can afford healthcare here.
@Linda65542703 @commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer Maybe you can show me a link or article showing that.  Nobody else has.
@commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer Delicate?  You called princess and when I retorted to your baiting you went to your followers and urged them to pile on by implying  a racist before you accused me of dropping the W bomb.  You're a hypocrite.  But look how bad I got under your skin.
@BravenakBlog Look lady, I got no beef with you or anyone else but if you're suggesting racism is worse in this country, that it wasn't always bad or harmful, just because Trump is in office, you're crazy.  Even if Democrats sweep to power, it isn't going to change that.
@davidkelley718 @commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer And I encourage you to blindly vote for a pro facist pro war duopoly that is unresponsive to the people &amp; only cares for rich folk &amp; see where it gets you.
@AndrewKarnitz @commiegirl1 @gretchenwhitmer They couldn't get it in California because Democratic super delegates overrode the will of the people.
Wow.  So Democratic supporters say I'm not special, my vote doesn't need to be earned, if I don't vote Democrat I'm a racist &amp; that by saying I'd feel better if my gubernatorial candidate supported M4A, I called her a whore.  This is why I don't vote them.
@all_the_Mindy @commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer Cite your sources to prove these wrong or STFU.
@commiegirl1 @gretchenwhitmer Why is it so important to you to try to frame me as a racist, woman hating person?  Also none of that happened but where you put words in my mouth, lady.
@commiegirl1 @gretchenwhitmer No I didn't even come close to those horrible words.  There you go again, not discussing, just trying to stir shit &amp; being classless.

@all_the_Mindy @commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer She brought up racism, I didn't.  She implied voting for anything but Democrats would imperil PoC, which is demonstrably false.  I was talking about M4A.
@commiegirl1 I'm just saying, you aren't here to discuss anything.  You're just here stirring shit because I tweeted I'd feel better voting for @gretchenwhitmer if she supported M4A.  Didn't say I wasn't; you overreacting asshats did.  Now I'm not voting for her at all.  Thanks, supporter.
@commiegirl1 Yes you did.  You didn't answer my questions, you went to your fans &amp; said, I don't want a pile on but...  Anyway, if you &amp; your sycophants think PoC haven't been suffering for generations &amp; it's only worse now, I don't know what to tell you.  This whole thing started over M4A.
@commiegirl1 Yes u did &amp; u still are. u still haven't said what socialism has 2 do with Democrats, u said not voting for Democrats meant I didn't care about minorities, u said they're doing worse but I can find news articles that say the opposite.  This started over M4A, you dragged it here.
@commiegirl1 So you're the victim after calling me princess &amp; now you have to twist my words?  You do you I guess.  Hopefully your followers aren't as disingenuous.
@commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer Also, what does socialism have to do with Democrats?  They're centre right.
@commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer It's hasn't gotten worse for them, it's always been bad.  You just haven't been paying attention.
@SenSchumer You're trying to reason with a sociopath, oligarch.  Try kicking him in the balls.
@commiegirl1 @MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer Seriously, if you think this hell only started 2 years ago, you're ignorant.  And yes, in a democracy votes need to be earned.  Just ask the millions who stay home rather than vote.  I do vote.  I participate.  You're just mad because I don't vote for your shitty party.
@ToddBohannon @TheDemocrats @dccc @TheDemocrats  @SenateDems  @HouseDemocrats @DNC  this is why you've lost my vote. Your worthless party needs to be scrap heaped so Americans can form a legitimate progressive left party that fights for them instead of some amoral, rich asshats.

@MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer It is about earning votes.  That's what wins elections.  The problem is I do care about people who are being decimated financially by skyrocketing health care costs.  It's a national crisis.  That we should maintain &amp; value the current shitty system is unacceptable to me.
@MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer They certainly haven't shown that.
@sarahpmb @MightyPrytanis @gretchenwhitmer It shouldn't be &amp; if we as a society perpetuate that, we have no busy being upset when our government does atrocious things nationally or globally because then we are complicit in those crimes.
@MightyPrytanis @sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer I'm not caving in this.  I've compromised plenty voting for incremental change that never happens with Democrats.  How about the MILLIONS not covered by the ACA.  Eff them, huh?  Earn my vote, don't sell me lesser of 2 evils to spook me into voting for you.
@sarahpmb @gretchenwhitmer See, this defense isn't very compelling.  It's never going to happen so no one should fight for it seems like a 'we'll lose before we begin' argument to me.  If we aren't talking about how to transition to Medicare 4 all, we're just going 2 be stuck with the same bad health care.
@gretchenwhitmer Medicare for all please.  The ACA is a giveaway to insurance companies.  I know BCBS is a major donor but if you could work for the people &amp; not the corporations, I'd be more inclined to vote for you.

@stucam7771 Once he was nominated, the entire Evangelical community circled the wagon around who they see as God's Man 4 the End Times which they believe is Imminent @ Any Minute.  To doubt him is to doubt God &amp; Faith &amp; they won't do that.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Yet another lie from our pussy grabber in Chief.  Fear mongering politics is pretty Nazi of you cats, but as far right, radicalised as your party is, it's not surprising.  Although it clears up why so many of your candidates running for office openly admire Hitler.
So @facebook why are you trying to suggest only far right, radicalised Republican shit to me when I'm clearly not interested?  Does this have anything to do with your recent censorship purge?  I don't like it.  Please stop with your bullshit.
@Joelcpj @pressfreedom @PostOpinions So Saudi Arabia killing kids in Yemen with US help: Meh.		Saudi Arabia killing a wapo journalist: The regime must suffer permanent, enduring repercussions!!!!		Me: Man the Wapo sucks morally &amp; ethically &amp; has seriously effed up priorities.
@MeetThePress @NBCNews @marcorubio More proof Rubio isn't really a Christian but a charlatan.  We're only killing kids in Yemen after all you ghoul.  But you take blood money from the NRA as well so your hypocrisy is known.
@chuckwoolery @KevinMKruse @THUNDERPOOL Clearly you don't know what any of these terms mean or how to use them properly, showing yet again that the radicalised right find their ignorance better informed than actual reality.

@tomwatson Hey dummy, it isn't because she's a female it's because she is a centre right neoliberal schill who takes big money from corporations and insurance companies. She's offering nothing but the status quo.  Mr. El-Sayed is a bona fide progressive with a bold vision for Michigan.
@kreativekonnect @PattyArquette @caitoz She voted for the Patriot Act, the Iraq war, was against gay marriage, used slave labour in Arkansas... We could go on and on why HRC was a shit candidate.
@PattyArquette @caitoz Right because all the war criminal presidents we've had for the last several decades we're way more honourable &amp; never did anything bad to the world ever.  SMH.  Lady, take your goddamn blinders off.
@PattyArquette @caitoz Assange didn't put Herr Trump into office you ninny, that would be @DWStweets @TheDemocrats &amp; @HillaryClinton rigging the election to put a shitty candidate that voters rejected in '08 as the presidential candidate.
@PattyArquette Why is it you are on the wrong side of everything progressive?  Perhaps you are more conservative than you'd care to admit?  Mr. Assange is a journalist who deserves the same protection under the 1st amendment as anyone else.  We're okay with Manning being tortured as well?
