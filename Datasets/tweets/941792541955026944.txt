@realDonaldTrump You could have lowered the repatriated earnings tax, eliminated the deductibility of state and local taxes, lowered individual rates but held the top rate and reduced the corporate rate by a lower amount.
@realDonaldTrump Corporations paid approximately 25% of total government revenue in the 70s. Now it‚Äôs below 10% and probably close to 5%. The middle class expanded to 60% after WWII. Now it‚Äôs about 50% thanks to Republcan efforts that started with President Reagan.
