When we waste food and it goes to the landfill and rots, greenhouse gasses are produced that hurt the planet, but making simple changes can help break this cycle. Here are some tips for preventing food waste and preventing climate change: https://t.co/d36ovtlAsM https://t.co/DfyzJNdejd
Taste it, don't waste it. When food ends up in landfills, it emits methane - a greenhouse gas that traps 30x more heat than carbon dioxide. #GCAS2018 #StepUp2018 https://t.co/d36ovtlAsM
