2.  Officers say the man didn't comply with the demand to drop the gun, that's when 8 officers fired their weapons. When the suspect went down officers performed CPR on the man. He later died at the hospital.
UPDATE: Austin police say shortly before 12:30 they received several 911 calls of fights outside of Terminal 6 on sixth street. Shortly after, officers respond to a disturbance behind the club. APD says they found a man with a gun gave several commands for him to drop it.
