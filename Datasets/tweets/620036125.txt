@MrTuck2013 Perhaps more of a medium term solution, but the best (only?) defence of FPTP is definitive results. Two of three most recent elections were hung parliaments, only more likely with fractured main parties. Even if they get majorities, will be w/ lower % of vote and less democratic

There is no bandwidth for anything beyond Brexit. The final payoff will be a weakened Europe, and a poorer Britain. And Putin will be laughing all the while.
When was the last time Russia was seriously challenged on Crimea, or Syria? The UK can barely bring itself to devote time to domestic priorities, because government departments are literally spending resources planning on a no deal Brexit
The UK's departure from the EU is part of a broader picture of destabilisation which Putin's Russia has promoted and revelled in, and the drawn out political divisions make it hard to deal on the threats Russia pose to international security
What's good for Putin is not going to be good for the West and good for the UK. We are going to be poorer, our European alliances are weakening, and forces of populism are now threatening the stability of NATO.
I am very confident that Putin isn't keen on Brexit because Britain is taking back control of its fisheries, so Leavers have to ask how they have come to be on the same side, and why it is that Putin is so gleeful at the prospect of Brexit.
Leavers and hard Brexiteers need to acknowledge this: that their position is one which has the full backing of Vladimir Putin. https://t.co/bfSMyvpNnQ

In situations like these, a second referendum might be seen as a way of averting disaster. But our elected representatives ‚Äì the majority of whom are not ideological Brexiteers ‚Äì should be able to put our interests above their personal electoral fortunes.
It is beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is no Brexit in which we will not be poorer and worse off. No Brexit where Britain alone has more global heft than as a leader of the EU. No Brexit where we have more free trade deals than we already access through our membership.
In reality, deciding things by referendum is not really sensible. The UK is a representative democracy, in the hope that our elected representatives can insulate us from the worst of our decisions. Its imperfect, but it‚Äôs a system that has largely worked for centuries.
Instead we‚Äôre getting ready to crash out with no deal. The government is calming reassuring us that there will be ‚Äòadequate‚Äô levels of food, and stockpiling medicine is just a precaution.
It was going to be ‚Äòeasy‚Äô to make a deal. The NHS would get billions of extra money (for free). No-one would want to leave the single market. Countries would be falling over themselves to trade with us. It isn‚Äôt like that, and was never going to be like that.
I understand the thinking behind this, and am generally sympathetic. The Leave campaign from the first referendum has little in common with the Brexit the government is pursuing.		https://t.co/eBo6xUaz1o
