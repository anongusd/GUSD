Mention of gov't overreach and limiting local &amp; municipal control conveniently missing from WMC or Chamber of Commerce member testimonies.
One contractor in favor of ban even has audacity to blame PLA for collapse of crane at Miller Park that killed 3 union ironworkers.
Assoc. Builders &amp; Contractors and Chamber of Commerce stack hearing room with contractors that have never bid PLA work. #PLAsWork #ab24
Only argument in favor of banning PLAs is to ban union-only clause. Moot point bc right-to-work is law. Leg Counsel agrees. #PLAsWork #ab24
