Don‚Äôt need to use their tactics, leaders can be strong &amp; passionately fight for what is right without being uncivil or dehumanizing others.  Those who are uncivil look so much more outrageous in comparison.
@MichaelAvenatti I believe you are wrong about this.  A strong candidate can stand up for what is right &amp; communicate it with strength.  It is harmful to use divisiveness &amp; lack of civility to validate his tactics.  Media needs to ask what candidates stand for &amp; demand the facts.

@GOP @realDonaldTrump Interesting because you were praising Michael Cohen while he was paying people off &amp; selling government access while working as RNC Deputy Finance Chair.  Perhaps you have a underlying motivation to discredit him? https://t.co/2KArbVrMbQ
@moscow_project Thank You for making this point.  I sense there is a lot of  information Cohen has about the GOP that they wish to discredit.  He was likely paying people off &amp; selling government access on their behalf as Deputy Finance Chair of the RNC. https://t.co/yhmrrWkG5F
@krassenstein Remember that as they try to discredit him they know that he was working on their behalf while he was paying people off &amp; selling government access.  He was Deputy Finance Chair of the National Republican Committee! https://t.co/g8DjNuTjyd
@SethAbramson He was also DEPUTY FINANCE CHAIR of the REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE.  Please remember that when the GOP tries to discredit him. https://t.co/yG0J47pzah
@robreiner The #ComplicitGOP will do everything they can to discredit him because he likely has a lot of information on them as well.  He was working for Republican National Committee while he was paying people off &amp; selling government access. https://t.co/t8UrWI4rbL
@pattirod55 @Jim_Jordan @OversightDems Remember that Cohen was working for the #ComplicitGOP while he was paying people off &amp; taking huge amounts of money from businesses.  They will try to discredit him because he likely has a lot on them as well. https://t.co/YQ7M8H66WR
