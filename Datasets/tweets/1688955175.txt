@TonyOhms @gramaredhen @SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed @TonyOhms  you're wrong on every count.	No, abortion doesn't kill people you dolt. A fetus is not a person. Also, my healthcare is not your decision. 	Approximately 3% of PP services are abortions. That's about as far from "most" as you can get.	Facts matter.
@Talus712 @dotdotdotPaul @gramaredhen @SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed @Talus712 no, not really, that's not how accounting works. Regardless, women's health care is under constant attack and it's disgusting that so many of you are self-appointed judges, deciding that it's ok for women to die because you want to make their health care decisions.
@TonyOhms @gramaredhen @SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed Why not @TonyOhms? If other forms of health care are funded why shouldn't abortion? You think that you should decide who lives and dies? 	Note that no tax dollars for Planned Parenthood go towards performing abortion.
@dotdotdotPaul @gramaredhen @SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed You can't put together a sentence @RichPoarch  yet you call others ignorant. No further comment needed.
@dotdotdotPaul @gramaredhen @SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed No tax dollars go towards abortions. 	Defunding PP proves that Rs don't care about the families who use it for routine medical care, which includes cancer screenings. The whole war on PP is part of the war on women and on the needy. It's deplorable.
@gramaredhen @nowisaythis @SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed ACA was initially a much better bill, before being cut to spreads by lobbyists &amp; insurance companies. Improvements have been blocked by the Rs in Congress. 	Lastly, dignity doesn't feed your family. Dollars can be the difference between a family eating &amp; not eating.

@gramaredhen @SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed You need to read more. No one is pro abortion.  Learn what a human is.

@rhodabseed @RepMarkMeadows @Redeemed1952 Yeah, funny shit coming from you.
@rhodabseed @RepMarkMeadows @Redeemed1952 You attacked the name of Jesus. You condemn women to death. You care nothing for life.
@gramaredhen @SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed I don't make up the meaning of words. I don't have opinions on what words mean. Definitions aren't subjective.
@gramaredhen @SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed Birth control and abortion are part of women's health care. Always have been, always will be.
@rhodabseed @RepMarkMeadows @Redeemed1952 What the fuck is wrong with you????? No one's sex is your business!!! You are self righteous garbage who thinks a fertilized egg is more valuable than actual living, breathing people!!! When did God name you judge and enforcer? You pervert.

@rhodabseed @RepMarkMeadows @Redeemed1952 Wrong! A baby is not being killed. That would be murder. My healthcare, saving my life, is priority. My healthcare is not your business, just as the fetus isn't.	So glad that you acknowledged that you're an imbecile. And that Jesus never spoke out against women's healthcare.

@RepMarkMeadows You're a liar. Tax revenue does not fund abortions, despite the fact that abortion is a form of health care. 	It's absolutely disgusting, appallingly evil, that you are willing to let women die rather than have a doctor refer them to proper health care. 	Evil misogynistic scum.

@Christa0003 @rklein90 You can believe what you want. It doesn't mean that you're not discriminating against people. 	The spouse of the VP, while he's in office, wanting to work for a place that openly discriminates is a very bad decision. She's a public figure advocating for bigotry. Deplorable.
@Christa0003 @rklein90 It is discrimination. The New Testament, ya know, the one about Christ, doesn't mention it. If you follow the Old Testament and not the New Testament you're not Christian.

@LukeEverhart1 @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump Thank your god all you want. Fortunately he doesn't have a vote.

Rich white men maintaining their power.
@LukeEverhart1 @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump Sensibilities? That's pretty funny. And there is zero to back up your illegal voting bullshit. False premise!
@LukeEverhart1 @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump It's not a discrepancy it's a differential, and percent-wise it's not huge. You're starting with 2 false premises.
@LukeEverhart1 @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump Coincidentally the differential in CA is a similar number to the national popular vote outcome. That has no bearing on the votes cast in the rest of the country, neither negates or lessens them. When you add up the popular vote total for all 50 states Clinton won by 3M.
@LukeEverhart1 @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump There was no vote differential in Clinton's favor in any other state?
@LukeEverhart1 @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump So CNN said that the entire 3M vote difference was in CA? Sure.
@LukeEverhart1 @williamlegate @realDonaldTrump No, that's not how numbers work. You don't move them to places you'd like to see them. It's easy to research what the popular vote was in each state.
