It was quite a speech from Trump at CPAC. w/ @b_fung https://t.co/v9vCUwpMcy
Per pooler @andreadrusch, ‚ÄúMembers of the audience left early. POTUS concluded his speech saying not one person had left early.‚Äù
We are now at two hours for Trump's speech.
Trump: "The Senate, far more important." 		True. :)
RT @ddale8: This is 100% the weirdest Trump speech I've ever heard.
Trump notes "the crazy female senator from the state of Ohio." The two senators from Ohio are men. Trump pivots to the senator from the state of "Hawaii, she's like a crazed person."
We are now more than an hour in Trump's speech at CPAC - interestingly, no mention of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who comes up regularly at his rallies.
Trump claims Newsom called him up recently and told him he's a "great president" but Trump says Newsom will probably deny it. 		"When he speaks about me, not so nice. But face to face, he loves me."
Who is this friend from New York?
Trump on John Podesta: "He still hasn‚Äôt gotten over getting his ass kicked."
"All of a sudden, they're trying to take you out with bullshit." -- Donald J. Trump.
Trump at CPAC - 		"And you know, I don‚Äôt know, maybe you know. You know, I‚Äôm totally off script right? Thank you darling. You know I‚Äôm totally off script right now. And this is how I got elected, by being off script. "

@myhlee @CNN @mj_lee Uh where are you guys

@EricSchultz Can you tell (some) senators this?
Barr: "I don‚Äôt subscribe to this lock-her-up stuff"
.@peterbakernyt's tweet is entered into the record.
Barr says he is open to reconsidering the Justice Department's current position on defending Obamacare in court (DOJ currently is not): 		"If I‚Äôm confirmed, I would like to review the department's position on that case."
Barr is not familiar with the Presidential Records Act?
Fine everyone I wrote about Liam https://t.co/9a0gHZsxnv
.@SenJohnKennedy grants @maziehirono a "third, fourth" round, even though Graham had decided earlier that senators would be limited to two.
Omg Liam https://t.co/eSOpcFMWro
A DC catering company requested anonymity because i"t regularly caters events for both the Republican and Democratic parties, and he didn‚Äôt want to come across as blaming one party for the shutdown" #thistown		https://t.co/hpm9vLfjNU
Barr on the criminal justice overhaul (the First Step Act): 		"If I had been at the table, I probably would‚Äôve urged a few changes to it but overall, I don‚Äôt have a problem with it."
Sometimes, I would like to end the Senate. https://t.co/uqK1c1yvdu
Drink every time Liam is mentioned
RT @Bencjacobs: Barr: "There hasn't been a special counsel removed since Archibald Cox and that didn't work out too well"
There has been more discussion about Barr's grandson Liam than like, immigration, it feels like.
.@SenKamalaHarris grills Barr in what instance he would go against recommendation of career DOJ ethics officials on a recusal.		Barr responds: "If I disagreed with it."

Klobuchar:  "If you‚Äôre confirmed, will the Justice Department jail reporters for doing their jobs?" 		Barr does not answer directly. Says he "can conceive of situations" where as a "last resort" that could happen, especially if a news outlet has run through a "red flag"
Slats!
I have not made a decision yet on confirmation. https://t.co/XdbMtL1oxZ
Pure legal nerd-dom: Barr says of doing legal citations in memos, "I like to have fun in life."
Not that this is unexpected, but Whitehouse admits that Barr will get confirmed: 		"I hope you‚Äôll become sure (of DOJ's communication policies with the White House) when you get there."
Barr said he did not make it a condition of getting the AG nomination that Rosenstein leaves. 		"He told me that he viewed it as a two year stint and would like to use if I‚Äôm confirmed, my coming in as an occasion to leave."
All of the morning action from Barr‚Äôs confirmation hearing, w/ @mattzap @DevlinBarrett @karoun https://t.co/kLqrAa88bT

This hearing is getting exciting. 		Leahy: "What about eminent domain?"		Barr: "What about eminent domain."
As well as @mattzap @DevlinBarrett @karoun https://t.co/pKVpm4TZhy
Barr calls it "ludicrous" the notion that he was auditioning for the attorney general job by making public comments critical of facets of the Mueller probe
Barr spoke with Trump anyway, but said he told him he couldn't join the legal team. Trump "asked me for my phone number, I gave it to him and I never heard from him again" (until he came calling for the AG job)
Barr testifies re: his convos about joining Trump's legal defense team: David Friedman (ambassador to Israel), who "was interested in finding lawyers that would augment the defense team." 		But Barr rejected, for personal and professional reasons at the time
.@ChuckGrassley is yelling about congressional oversight - which he gets very energized about. https://t.co/KL8sJoiNjP
Barr also disputes reporting that Trump interviewed him in 2017 to be part of his private legal defense team, says it was "one conversation with him that related to his private representation."
Barr on his convos about the special counsel probe with the WH: "I discussed the Mueller investigation but not in any particular substance. I can go thru my conversations with you if you want."		Feinstein says later
Barr says there's a "dispute" as to what the emoluments clause relates to, "I can‚Äôt even tell you what it says at this point."
Barr -- 		"If confirmed, I will not let partisan politics, personal interests or any other improper consideration to interfere with this or any other investigation."

My story from 2016 that lays out the deep internal Republican divisions on sentencing reform -- https://t.co/w4188JBz9z
Description here -- but basically, the major concessions were that most of the sentencing changes would NOT apply retroactively. Earlier versions would have allowed that. https://t.co/YcjqZDVu3N https://t.co/crGnbuBiBm
Senators reached a more sweeping sentencing deal under the Obama administration, but it was vehemently opposed by the likes of Cotton, Sessions, Risch. But by scaling it back and Trump giving cover to Rs by backing it, significantly ups the chances this deal passes, becomes law
