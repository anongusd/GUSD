@pushkinforhouse And thanks for the kind comments. There is no reason people can’t disagree and still get along.  A good debate on issues is a positive thing.
@pushkinforhouse Don’t get too carried away. I said you were right that the people will decide. I dont think I can say you are right on any of the other comments. Lol.
@pushkinforhouse You are right Mike. The people will decide as they should. I’m certainly willing to put the successes of the last 4 years up against the record of the previous 84 years and let the people decide. I’ve enjoyed serving with you as well and enjoy the debate.
@pushkinforhouse Some of the “solutions” that you say didn’t run were not adopted because they were the same ones that were tried many times in the last 84 years and failed. The people of our state made a change in 2014 for a reason. They wanted new solutions.
@pushkinforhouse Respectfully, your party had an awfully long time in control to fix the problems you mention. 84 years in fact. I didn’t see many of those solutions you mention on agendas during my first 16 years in the House when Democrats were in control. We are now adopting bold solutions.
@pushkinforhouse And also Mike, you aren’t really going to try to deny that the reforms we have made have put us on the right track? I also talked with a legislator from Colorado who said legalization was a huge mistake. They are suffering from a lot of unintended consequences.
@pushkinforhouse Mike, I was only commenting on the fact that about the only thing I hear the Democrat Party talk about, or post about  in our state is marijuana.  I realize it’s an important issue to some. But really, is that Democrat platform to move our state forward. Is that all you have?

A quick clarification to my former tweet. We believe the last time a budget was passed during the regular sesssion without an extension was 1986. That was 32 years ago instead of 35. We will complete our work tonight and not be in extended session next week.
This morning both the House and Senate passed the Budget Bill and sent it to the Governor for signature. This is the first time in at least 32 years that the budget has been completed within the 60 Day session without an extended session.

SB 550 giving $100 million of state funds to casinos to buy new slot machines is one of the worst bills passed In my 13 years in the House.
House Republicans today again attempted to fully eliminate the food tax but our efforts were again blocked by the Democrat leadership.
Busy week at the Legislature.  Disappointed the House has not agreed to reduce the food tax or give other tax relief to West Virginians.
