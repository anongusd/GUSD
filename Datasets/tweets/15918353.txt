Read the full #carbontax analysis here: https://t.co/2QK8oNQwyG
4. Depressed GDP leads to long-term fiscal challenges, with particular stress on states. The average annual burden on the states and local government during the first 10 years of the tax would range from $18.9 to $30.6 billion.
3. No carbon tax modeled is consistent with meeting the long-term U.S. Paris Agreement INDC. As a standalone policy, consistent with World Bank and IEA estimates, all carbon tax scenarios analyzed are far off of the trajectory the Paris Agreement sets for 2040.
2. A carbon tax is not an efficient revenue raiser for tax reform. Using standard scoring conventions, a carbon tax is likely to only produce net revenue available for tax reform of 32 cents on the dollar.
The results: 	1. A carbon tax will not be pro-growth. In particular, a lump-sum rebate results in lost GDP equal to between $3.76 trillion and $5.92 trillion over the 22-year forecast period. https://t.co/2QK8oNQwyG https://t.co/OAREsdTisf
Two of the proposals modeled begin at a set rate &amp; increase annually (beginning at $40 &amp; $49 dollars per metric ton of CO2 &amp; increase annually by 2%). Four phase in over time to a terminal value. These are taxes with terminal values of $36, $72, $108, &amp; $144 per ton.

Despite the hysteria, in 2017 the United States had the largest reduction in carbon dioxide emissions in the world. https://t.co/pCFsujW9W6 https://t.co/vfk0mUSIv3
Despite a mandate from the California state government, the technology does not yet exist to have the state's electrical grid run on 100% emission free power sources. https://t.co/2xmmaLt9pi https://t.co/IxOir1xy2k

Repealing the Renewable Fuel Standard is still the best policy solution available to the American people👉 https://t.co/E3ZPhSqYQU
Sierra Club engaged in a campaign “to defeat new coal-fired power plants in Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Wyoming.” Subsequently the group was directly involved in blocking the development of power plants in those states. https://t.co/Ubt5hHVyOM https://t.co/gI4c7opgFI
When recent Nobel laureate William Nordhaus published the results of his 2007 analysis, at that time the 1.5°C ceiling would have made humanity $14 trillion poorer than doing nothing at all about climate change. The U.N. has now adopted this goal. https://t.co/ojtdZzUWgv https://t.co/J5HOI2UhRg
