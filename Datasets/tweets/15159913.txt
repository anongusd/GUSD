One man from the Cleveland area told me the hardest part is explaining it to his kids. Another couple, both air traffic controllers from Shreveport, went from a two income household to a no income household and weren't sure how they would make ends meet if it continues.
Spent the last hour outside the Capitol talking to air traffic controllers who received their first pay stubs with no salary. Not one person I spoke to said they intended to call out if the shutdown continued and instead vowed to keep showing up w/out $ to keep the skies safe.

I should add, I think Ohio State would have lost. Clemson is really good and the Buckeyes defense could not have kept up. But Georgia? I dunno. It could have been a better game. 		Also it should be an eight team playoff. 		Finally, go not Alabama.		Ok, I‚Äôm done now.

to be clear ...I'm not saying there were no Women's March volunteers. Obviously there are/were (I saw the one in DC and covered the one in Las Vegas earlier this year - I've seen them first hand). They are just not acknowledged in this IRS filing much like the affiliates marches.
