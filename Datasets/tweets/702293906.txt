@Alobar2 @TheAtheistPig I see...
@AnsgarTOdinson @ToyaDee78 I get that.
@AnsgarTOdinson @ToyaDee78 Well, like I said, it was based more on Miles Morales than Peter Parker. I thought Avengers was good too. And you have to admit that the MCU is very well put together in terms of giving hints and paying out on those hints. The overall story of the MCU, I enjoy very much.
@AnsgarTOdinson @ToyaDee78 Well that's not MCU yet but yes Deadpool was amazing. More the first than the second but I definitely saw some comic book moments in the second.
@AnsgarTOdinson @ToyaDee78 Most definitely. I enjoyed Homecoming. Its was more based on Miles Morales.
@AnsgarTOdinson @ToyaDee78 Well some of them have been good in that regard, I think. Iron Man 1... ok that's the only one I can think of.

@AnsgarTOdinson @TRej2011 @HondaGuy4 But its only one springy thing. Two springy things is 2 so one springy thing would be 1. Also order of operations would mean the springy thing x the piston would go first. So it would be 15 (or 25 if the springy thing equals 2).
@TRej2011 It's either 15 or 60. No parentheses so I'm leaning toward 15.

@LORDlifeleafs @PPact No such thing as neutrality.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact And he's a criminal and is not anywhere close to the standard for doctors.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact Seeing as that doesn't actually happen, no.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact They do. They adhere to all reasonable safety standards.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact Doesn't mean they performed the abortions.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact So because you don't agree with the organization they must be lying? Then I don't believe a word out of your mouth.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact Who?
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact Nope. Most of their money comes from the government. That money cannot be used for abortions.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact Then stop denying reality
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact They do operate within safe standards and do not need admission privileges. The patients absolutely come first. Your insinuation otherwise is idiotic.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact I doubt that seeing as third trimester abortions are surgical and need an OR.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact And? Who better to know what they charge than someone who works there.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact Those that care more about their patients than you seem to.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact No. Planned parenthood does more than just abortions.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact Depends on the outcome.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact He's also an OBG and has a vested interest in the health of his patients.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact Planned parenthood does not perform third trimester abortions
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact https://t.co/mz5i81ZQci
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact And I can provide you with more that don't.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact And PPA provides services for every amount of non-donation money they receive.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact First off, equality of outcome is not immoral. Second, how can the opportunity be equal when those colleges have for decades refused to admit anyone not white?
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact https://t.co/UfW7wpMRK8
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact Not according to the doctors.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact That is not true.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact Are you a doctor? Didn't think so. You obviously have no idea what is medically necessary.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact Yes it is.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact I don't see how it is immoral to include a group of people that wouldn't otherwise have been able to get in.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact No I care more about facts. I know people who had to have an abortion because their life was at risk.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact It absolutely does count as revenue. If it's money coming in, its revenue. And that number of 1500 is not accurate.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact I know. Where do you think I got the 15%. 3% of their services they give are abortions. 15% of the revenue they receive are from abortions. A majority of the revenue they get is from the government which can't be for abortions.

@LORDlifeleafs @PPact If the life of the woman is at stake.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact Your point? Abortions are sometimes medically necessary. Not to mention constitutional protected.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact Seems I was wrong about the number but they perform way more services than just abortion. In fact only 3% of their services are abortion. https://t.co/ApdFsbq7MI
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact No its not. Abortion is a legal and proper medical procedure. Slavery is owning another person. I take it you are not a healthcare professional.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact It absolutely does if necessary.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact No there are not. PPA provides much more than abortions and helps hundreds of millions of women each year. And guess what? Less access to safe abortions will only lead to unsafe abortions.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact Wrong. It takes money away from places that even mention abortion. And PP has delivered more babies than it has performed abortions.
RT @BadConservart: Causing nuclear war to own AOC because she won't debate you and you really need her attention. https://t.co/eh5FDBzjM6
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact Also abortion is absolutely healthcare. To deny that is to reject medical science.
@LORDlifeleafs @PPact Oh I see. You're one of THOSE people. I haven't the time or energy to tell you how wrong you are. Suffice it to say that this gag order is as sexist as it is harmful to women.

@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact You cannot define a procedure without explaining how it is done.
@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact The pregnancy is not terminated until the fetus or embryo is removed.

@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact First off, the goal isn't to kill children. Second, both the fetus and the pregnant woman could die as a result of an unsafe abortion. Statistics show that if you make abortion illegal, unsafe abortions would be performed in greater numbers.

@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact If none of the procedures are safe then that would reflect the worst case scenario. If abortions are made illegal, then all abortions would be unsafe. If safe abortions were hard to get that would mean more unsafe abortions would happen. Its not that hard to understand.
@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact Once again, your lack of reading comprehension is showing. The first sentence of the paragraph does not encompass the entire definition.
@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact By removing the embryo or fetus! Jesus fucking christ! Your ignorance is infuriating.
@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact If you're not going to read the link, I have no more patience for your ignorance.
@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact Do I really need to hold your hand through this? More pregnant women die as a result of unsafe abortions. Read the damn link.

@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact Which is why I said the benchmark is SAFE ABORTIONS!
@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact Yes and the way that abortion ends a pregnancy is by removing the embryo or fetus. If the fetus is dead, it still needs to be removed and the operation is called an abortion.

@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact No I'm taking other "branches" and saying this is what our "branch" will look like if we keep making it harder to get safe abortions.
@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact No. The benchmark is safe abortions. In countries where abortions are safe, less pregnant women die.
@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact Seeing as abortion is legal and funded in the US, we don't see these statistics here. But once we start making it illegal or harder to get, we will see an increase in those stats, like in the countries where abortions are illegal or underfunded.
@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact So only the first line of a paragraph counts? I've been reading wrong this whole time. üôÑ
@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact Is a "branch" not a part of the whole "tree"? Not to mention, all we need to do to be like those countries is to make abortion illegal or underfunded.
@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact Abortion is the removal of an embryo or fetus. Would you like me to read this tweet to you as well?
@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact Those statistics are in countries where abortion is either illegal or very underfunded. Hence the reason for the article.
@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact Unsafe abortions happen everywhere and result in death everywhere. It still applies to the US.
@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact Seems you need an English lesson. https://t.co/hwHiEcpTCS
@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact You're right. Most are safer.
@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact The article proves that access to safe abortions saves lives. No speculation necessary.
@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact That's the only time a surgical abortion happens and a dead fetus still needs to be removed.
@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact So you're saying the anatomy of peoples reproductive systems is different depending on if they live in the US or not?
@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact The goal of the gag order is to make it harder to recieve a safe abortion. The lack of safe abortions will cause more deaths.
@TrueM0derate @Downeyangel @PPact You mean the ones where they have to remove a dead fetus or have to save the life of the pregnant woman? Great plan. üôÑ

@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist ...religion for the terrible things all leaders that were religious did. And I guarantee you, more terrible things have been done by religious leaders than atheist ones.
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist ...atheists but because of the personality and paranoia of the person in charge. They also were anti-freedom. That is not an atheistic position any more than it is a religious position. If you blame atheism for the terrible things that, say, Stalin did, then you have to blame...
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Also there are more examples of religious political rule that is dangerous to non-believers. Nearly every religion holds a death sentence for people that don't believe. Atheism holds no such rule. The "atheist" regimes that have killed people haven't done so because they were...
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Just because some atheists have organized doesn't mean that atheism as a whole is dangerous. I can show you examples of atheists that have done great things for the community. I am all for freedom of religion. As are most atheists.
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Not all atheists are sure regarding the existence of deities. In fact, I would say most aren't.
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist I don't know. I find it hard to put percentages on things like that. Still, belief is different than knowledge. I believe the Jacksonville Jaguars are the best NFL team. I have no data to back that up. One doesn't have to apply Huxley's principles on ever aspect of life.
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Also generalizations like that are dangerous. Atheists are no different than any other person. And as for danger, when was the last time you heard of an "atheist terrorist"?
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Ok but that has nothing to do with negative atheists also being agnostic. Also positive and negative atheists aren't contradicting each other. And the atheist "community" isn't really a community in my mind. The word "atheist" is a descriptor just like theist is a descriptor.
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Will do!
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist He dismissed positive atheism. Negative atheism wasn't a thing when he was alive.
@SteveMcRae_ @AMilitantAgnost @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist According to you. Negative atheism is still a version of atheism.
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist I don't know what you mean by "abhorrent history" but you aren't the arbiter of who is or is not agnostic. Negative atheism does not contradict agnosticism. In fact, it practically demands it.
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist It seems reminiscent of Plato's cave, doesn't it?
@SteveMcRae_ @AMilitantAgnost @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Not all atheists do. Negative atheists do not.
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Cool. I'll see what I can find.
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist "Most". That right there agrees with my point that "some" atheists can also be agnostic.
@SteveMcRae_ @AMilitantAgnost @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist So then they would all be LOGICALLY compatible even if they are not epistemologically compatible.
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Damn. Oh well. üòÖ
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Exactly. I'm not claiming otherwise.
@SteveMcRae_ @AMilitantAgnost @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Now you're confusing the issue. You can't claim they are the same in one regard then say they aren't compatible in that same regard because of something that you, yourself, said had no bearing on the first regard.
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Because it describes what I believe or, in this case, what I don't believe. Atheism is about belief just as theism is about belief.
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Do you know what the image is called specifically?
@SteveMcRae_ @AMilitantAgnost @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Which means they are compatible on that claim.
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist I know in some regards they are the same. I'm not disputing that. But to say the because they agree on some things doesn't make them logically the same. It only makes them logically the same on those things.
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Thousands of years huh? Do you know who did come up with it?
@SteveMcRae_ @AMilitantAgnost @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist But only for that specific proposition. That proposition does not encompass all those religions are.
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist I do in the terms of knowledge. I never claim to know something I don't. As for beliefs, I believe things I cannot prove.
@SteveMcRae_ @AMilitantAgnost @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Also that is only one proposition. Yes they are the same for that proposition but only that proposition. From the proposition that Jesus is the son of god, they differ greatly.

@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Oh that's a clever thing. Mind if I take that?
@SteveMcRae_ @AMilitantAgnost @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Because they believe different things. They follow different rules. They worship differently. Just because they agree on one statement doesn't make them the same.
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Well he claims it proves that negative atheism and agnosticism are logically similar if not the same. Also your claiming that I am incorrect for disagreeing with you.
@SteveMcRae_ @AMilitantAgnost @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist That p is true. But that only means that both agree on one statement. That doesn't make them logically the same. It makes them similar but not logically the same.
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist It doesn't matter how you see it. It is still a form of atheism.
@SteveMcRae_ @AMilitantAgnost @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Your link said that agnosticism and negative atheism are logically similar, if not the same. That is the definition of compatible.
@SteveMcRae_ @AMilitantAgnost @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Except they aren't contrary. They are both based on the same holy books and hold similar beliefs. It can even be said they worship the same god.
@SteveMcRae_ @AMilitantAgnost @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist I still don't follow. Them both believing in one god  does not make them the same.
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist The history of a term has no bearing on whether or not it is compatible with another term. @SteveMcRae_ provided a link that proved the compatibility between negative atheism and agnosticism.
@SteveMcRae_ @AMilitantAgnost @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist That is a drastic and completely unreasonable oversimplification. Islam and Christianity are not only defined by belief in one god. There are many distinctions between the two.
@JK_Riki @Goodbye_Jesus It's my bad, no apologies necessary.
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Atheist history? Also you do realize that not all atheists are the same, right? Negative atheism, or "weak" atheism as @SteveMcRae_ refers to it, is absolutely compatible with agnosticism since it makes no knowledge claim.
@AMilitantAgnost @SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Well it depends on the type of atheism.
@SteveMcRae_ @AMilitantAgnost @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist But they aren't logically the same. One views Jesus as divine the other just reveres him as a prophet.
@JK_Riki @Goodbye_Jesus Oh I seem to gave misunderstood your tweet. I thought you meant that the idea of a god is shrinking.
@SteveMcRae_ @AMilitantAgnost @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Which means its extremely compatible.
@DanielW37136702 @MrBrownSnr @FlatEarthExpert @iamAtheistGirl It's already been tested.

@rubyschild72 @Soapbox_Atheist You as well.
@SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist @AMilitantAgnost Exactly. The way I see it is, atheism is a claim of belief. Agnosticism is a claim on knowledge. One doesn't contradict the other since they are about different things.
@SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist @AMilitantAgnost I suppose. But in that regard the two are interchangeable.
@SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist @AMilitantAgnost I never said it was closer to one or the other. Also I don't think "weak theism" is really a thing. Agnosticism and atheism aren't even positions on the same thing. They are two separate issues, in my mind.
@rubyschild72 @Soapbox_Atheist I, at no point in this discussion, mentioned anything to do with my lack of belief. I was simply stating that it is, in fact, a sin for you to use your god's name vain.
@SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist @AMilitantAgnost I see. Either way you did prove that negative atheism or "weak" atheism is still compatible with agnosticism.
@rubyschild72 @Soapbox_Atheist And yet you haven't proven me wrong. If this is how you debate, you've already lost.
@SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist @AMilitantAgnost Like I said, that only if you define atheism as the opposite of theism. That would be anti-theism. The prefix "a-" means not. So based on that atheism would simply mean not-theism. Besides you already proved negative or "weak" atheism is compatible with agnosticism.
@SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist @AMilitantAgnost Only if you view atheism as the opposite of theism. We have already shown there are many different definitions to atheism. You just said it is possible to be a weak atheist and agnostic.

@rubyschild72 @Soapbox_Atheist Is that so? Perhaps you should ask your priest next time you see him. https://t.co/HP8R5DCXNZ https://t.co/n9BlqNsS6N
@SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist That doesn't dispute the claim that some atheists are also agnostic and also hold to Huxley's view.
@SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist "Weak theism"? Never heard the term. Either way that still proves that atheism and agnosticism are not mutually exclusive. There are atheists that are agnostic. Not all atheists are but some are. Also that doesn't dispute the claim made in the link.

@SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Ok. "As an atheist, I lack a belief in any gods".
@SteveMcRae_ @AReligious666 @Soapbox_Atheist Atheism isn't just a philosophical term. And all that means is he is supposedly making an argument that it should be defined, philosophically, as such. There are other philosophers that disagree.

@unalignedblog @iamAtheistGirl Your denial of those simple facts doesn't bode well for your argument.
@unalignedblog @iamAtheistGirl I don't care if others are calling for it, it has nothing to do with them being an atheist or not. And it certainly has nothing to do with being an evangelical.
@unalignedblog @iamAtheistGirl Since when did you become the arbiter of how to be an atheist? As for behavior, I'm not the one trying to label others with an obvious oxymoron.
@unalignedblog I really don't care what you like to call me. Evangelicalism refers to religion, specifically christianity. Atheism isn't a religion.
@unalignedblog @iamAtheistGirl That makes no sense. Who cares if scientists lie sometimes? Everyone lies sometimes. Dictionaries are the authority on the meanings of words. That's why they were invented. None of that points to any sort of "evangelical atheism".

RT @AndrewLSeidel: Review for The Founding Myth from @PublishersWkly is up: "Seidel, a constitutional attorney, provides a fervent takedown‚Ä¶
@JamesPlaskett Yes eventually. But the changes are so gradual that there isn't really a generation that will look so different from the one directly before it that you could say a new species evolved.
@JamesPlaskett Yes but that is just evolution. Neo-darwinism isn't a thing.
@JamesPlaskett I think where you are getting hung up is that Ren thinks you are talking about a dog giving birth to a non-dog. That is impossible.
@JamesPlaskett Also animals evolving from one species to another is how evolution works. There is no such thing as "neo-darwinism".
@JamesPlaskett Actually if you look at the whole line of microbe to whale with parent to child, the change is so indistinguishable from parent to child you wouldn't be able to point to the specific point where one species changes into the next.
@afroafrolistik @RNesling @NoImBillCarey A dog will not give birth to another species. That process is extremely gradual, each generation having a chance to develope a tiny genetic mutation but each generation looking almost indistinguishable from the previous. Over time, yes, a dog could evolve into another species.
@JamesPlaskett Yes but a microbe does not give birth to a whale any more than a dog gives birth to a "non-dog".
@JamesPlaskett The idea that a dog gives birth to a "non-dog" is not something that happens.
@JamesPlaskett That's called natural selection not "neo-darwinism.
@JamesPlaskett Even if a dog gives birth to an offspring that has a small genetic change, that offspring is still a dog. There is no sudden change in genetics that delineates one species from its ancestor. It's a gradual process.
RT @Renevelation: I accept evolution via Natural selection and I can tell you:		You are misrepresenting it and it's probably because you do‚Ä¶
@JamesPlaskett I don't know what neo-darwinism is but evolution does not claim a dog can give birth to a non-dog. Each generation is practically indistinguishable from the previous. Its difficult to put a specific point on the evolutionary line as to when one species evolves out of another.
RT @Renevelation: That is so not the claim.		If you think it is then I recommend you dig into what evolution actually is		Because it doesn'‚Ä¶
@JamesPlaskett That's an oversimplification. Each evolutionary change is so small that each generation is almost indistinguishable from the one previous. A dog doesn't simply give birth to a non-dog.

@JamesPlaskett No it actually doesn't. All the monkeys, as they exist today, evolved from a common ancestor. But it is difficult to point to a specific point on the line where the monkey ancestor becomes a monkey since each generation is almost indistinguishable from the previous.
RT @Renevelation: Evolution does not say that a dog produced a non dog nor does it say a monkey produced a non monkey.	Might be better to a‚Ä¶
@afroafrolistik @RNesling @NoImBillCarey Nope. A monkey, as it is today, is the current iteration of a long line of creatures that evolved into the monkey. Also dogs were artificially selected to evolve from wolves into the many different kinds of dogs you see today.
@JamesPlaskett A microbe becoming a whale isn't the microbe "leaving the branch". Think of it like this. A tree has many branches but they all originate at one trunk. Think of the original microbe as the trunk and the whale as just one of the many branches.
@JamesPlaskett The parent of the "non-dog thingie" would look almost indistinguishable from the "non-dog thingie". Placing specific points as to where one species evolves into another is very difficult to do on a line of parent-child delineation. But it is still all part of one branch.
