@itsme8209 @Debbie05499869 @TheRickyDavila It's empowered. Again watch the video. I saw him smile, laugh and try not to laugh but the "smirk" was more an awkward pic moment. He may have acted like a typical teenager, by not taking much seriously, but guess what? He is a teenager. What is the grown mens' excuse?
@TheRickyDavila I watched the almost 2 hr video. At about 1:09 the main black man clearly yells, "look at their hats!", then Mr. Phillips continues over to the boys and beats his drum in their faces. It's clear who was targeted and why. These are grown men goading teenagers. Smh.
@StanovcakFrank @kiwi4lyfe7 @feltfilms @andrewkimmel @shaunking @ka_ya11 Watch the video again, ya missed a lot. The angry black men were yelling at the kids, goading them.

@casiichandler i defend their right to spout bullshit...but not at a funeral, that's sacred and should be protected. let's agree to disagree
@casiichandler they are still allowed to protest they just have to keep their distance and give them a mere four hours window for grieving.
@casiichandler i never said i wanted to get rid of them but that soldier and his family deserve to be protected on the day of the funeral.
@casiichandler that's what i thought. talk about a waste of time.
@casiichandler a soldier goes, fights for you, dies and then the family is hassled like that and you say end of story. #thewrongway
@casiichandler you never answered my question...do you think they should be allowed to protest a funeral in the name of free speech?
@casiichandler not at all. just simply not at funerals.
@casiichandler and in that defense you think they should be aloud to protest at funerals? serious question.
@casiichandler but don't worry, there are enough people like you out there that they'll be back protesting dead people in no time.
@casiichandler i agree, but there is a time and place and all congress did is stand up and say that a funeral is not one of them.
@casiichandler if logic allows a family that has lost a loved one to be hounded by ignorance on the day they lay them to rest, keep it.
@casiichandler congress didn't ban anything, they are simply holding WBC to a standard of decency that every human being should be held to.
@casiichandler keep standing up for this kind of freedom of speech and eventually we'll lose it all together. you need to grow up.
@casiichandler my eyes are open, you need to see that there is a line that was crossed and they are hiding behind the 1st Amend.
@casiichandler them making freedom of speech look like a bad idea is why congress stepped up. the world hates us and our freedoms enough.
@casiichandler WBC is a cult but apparently you're buying what they're selling. if that's where you're research got you, no thanks.
@casiichandler the issue is WBC not the government and what's sad is how you stand up for them when all they do is spread hate.
@casiichandler laws are to protect us from people who wish to do harm and as far as i've seen that's WBC's aim.
@casiichandler i understand that freedom of speech should never include picketing a funeral. http://t.co/lnII5KcE learn what pervert means.
@casiichandler oh wait, thanks to congress now it is! #therightway to fix this country is to quit letting people pervert our rights/freedoms
@casiichandler they can have my right to protest at funerals, being a decent human being i would never do that. it should be illegal.
@casiichandler perverting freedom of speech isn't a right, decency should be though...congress did something #therightway for a change.
