@glennbeck    Have a great day from Denali National Wilderness Park
@glennbeck to him to his face.    One other thing, I can't believe the NRA actually has endorsed Paul Ryan for re-election.  Rediculous.
@glennbeck    In particular, one little Reince Prebius.   Sniveling little twerp that he is. A total coward, and I have no issue saying that
@glennbeck   For the exact same reasons in the attempt to get closed primaries.  Stupid people are now, seemingly in charge of the RNC
@glennbeck    And this morning Doc and Skip were talking about Ken Cuccenelli, and his walking out the other day, I would have walked too
@glennbeck  to endorse trump. I don't see others endorsing the Cheetos faced jerk.  I'm proud of what Ted did. He said his peace. üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üëçüëç
@glennbeck   As you said, trump had approved it and Ted delivered it with some good punches.  Screw the NY delegation, for their calls

@vinnygop    Agreed.

@vinnygop @Lindafederer    I aka over it.  I'm not over how trump will screw the country though.
@vinnygop   Carlitos, I'm not in denial what so ever, trump was the wrong choice for America.  To bad far too many don't see that
@vinnygop @Lindafederer    And the Reince Prebius RNC is full of shitheads
@vinnygop @Lindafederer so you go right on ahead bashing the constitutionalist and go with the asshole.  Be my guest to do that. Most will

@ColtsFan1971812   when they went for Rubio and then trump when Rubio dropped out.  Just the same old MSM.
@ColtsFan1971812    That's a line from CNN, as far as I'm concerned, nothing they say can be believed. I used to listen and watch Fox but

@ColtsFan1971812    laws of the United States, as she has consistently demonstrated just like her boss.   And I pray that the GOP figures it
@ColtsFan1971812    to be forcibly removed from that position, but Obozo has her there for just that reason, because she won't follow the
@ColtsFan1971812    Illegals have the "RIGHT" to work in the United States just like citizens do,  now that's just crazy and the woman needs

@mj32306 @lusciouslindaw @Individual_Intv @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC     And I could just about guarantee that trump voted for Obama.  Both times
@mj32306     As they can be at any time.   States parties make their own rules. That's what is so great about our election system
@mj32306 @lusciouslindaw @Individual_Intv @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC    Marion. Not at all.

@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews    Right out of thin air. She has a lot of late (the last couple years) looked buffoonish

@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews    Honestly, what cricked people ??   Those in states that do primaries their way ??
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews   At least Cruz is for OUR rights where trump doesn't give a shit about OUR rights at all
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews   And I say that because of trumps history of funding every democrat that comes along
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews   Honestly, Linda, between trump &amp; Cruz, there's really only 1 choice and its not trump
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews @Reince    Well, Linda, like I said a little bit ago, trump has to run the field he won't
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews   Every state does primaries their own way.  The RNC doesn't set those rules, states do
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews   Like NY where it's a get 50% and its winner take all or those proportional states.
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews     Linda, forget Colorado.  They have done that there for years. Not every state does it
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews    And I don't believe he will
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews     Well pretty much the only way trump gets nominated by the numbers is to run the field
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews thanks.     But I had looked at it and recognized what was being attempted to be said
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews    Because they see Hillary will kick trumps ass but not Cruz's
@lusciouslindaw @Individual_Intv @FoxNews   She and her campaign are anticipating trumps nomination, because he seems to have the best path
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews @CNN @MSNBC   Well, at least there 2 networks then that ARE NOT in trumps pocket
@lusciouslindaw @Individual_Intv @FoxNews   That was the NY Primary, not the General Election. They know trump will loose to Hillary
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews   Linda, I did look at the poll, so don't try to put me down that way.
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews The only thing I worry about is Trump in the White House, he'll be worse then Obama
@lusciouslindaw @mj32306 @Individual_Intv @FoxNews   No, what I see is the folks in NY were pissed about NY Values comment

@MichaelCohen212     He needs to earn his nomination.  He he's short on delegates, then play by the rules and fight it out at convention.
@MichaelCohen212     You know, honestly, does Donald make deals for property and then think he can get away with giving someone less  ??
@MichaelCohen212    And as you just said, if trump is 30 delegates short, No it's not a gime. It has to be earned he knows that. Crybaby
@MichaelCohen212     Trump needs to put his big boy pants on and stop being a little crybaby.   Either Put Up or Shut Up.    Learn your job
@MichaelCohen212    You know Michael, Donald trump is supposedly an adult, he acts like a crybaby with the delegate situation.
