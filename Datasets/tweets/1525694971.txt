Votes are still being counted in the extremely competitive #AZSen race, and young voters could push @kyrstensinema over the top. #AZpol https://t.co/xm2uPfCr8f
Voting in student-dense precincts was up throughout New Hampshire, helping the state send its first openly gay representative, @ChrisPappasNH, to Congress. #NHpol https://t.co/04UqvN3fjZ
Iowa elected @Axne4Congress and @Abby4Iowa, who becomes the second-youngest woman ever elected to Congress. #IApol https://t.co/5buqAp44Nr
Skyrocketing #youthvote turnout in North Carolina shattered the Republican supermajority in the state legislature. #NCpol https://t.co/2veWdpqEZK
Thanks to increased #youthvote turnout, California has unseated multiple Trump-supporting representatives—with some races still too close to call. #CApol https://t.co/UKP3pSBnBm
Florida restored voting rights to 1.4 million disenfranchised voters. Hard to overstate the gigantic, generational impact of that victory. #Flpol	https://t.co/KcySVsZ2Og
The #youthvote endured eight years of @ScottWalker’s attacks on education, but managed to #StickItToScotty and replace him with career educator @Tony4WI. Young voter enthusiasm in this very close race made the difference. #WIpol https://t.co/EGQ06wAmDB
Virginia replaced three GOP incumbents with Democratic women. #YouthVote turnout soared in those districts. #VApol https://t.co/YC2861Uk4i
Pennsylvania broke up its all-male congressional delegation with a record-setting number of women. Turnout in one key #YouthVote Indicator Precinct was over six times higher than 2014 turnout. #PApol https://t.co/sXG2dmNrEg
In Michigan, the #youthvote turned out to elect a women-led slate of candidates, including new governor @GretchenWhitmer. #MIpol https://t.co/ilgTA1o4ky
Nevada replaced Trump enabler @DeanHeller (not everything Trump touches turns to gold like Dean says, huh). The Battle Born State is now represented by two women senators, a Democratic governor, and a Democratic legislature. #NVpol https://t.co/H4Y60EyDwX
It’s the year of the woman and the year of the #youthvote. #ElectionDay2018 saw a record-breaking number of women and LGBTQ+ people elected to office—plus the highest young voter turnout in decades. 	 	A thread on results from the 11 states we organized. https://t.co/1YmI4OgjFS
Another critical takeaway from @dellavolpe: Nearly all of the vote increase from 2014 to 2018 went to Democrats. Why turning out the #youthvote is so important! https://t.co/Z6KVaCzTJb https://t.co/K5ISMPk5rg

That’s why NextGen America is running the largest youth organizing program in American history. Our organizers in 11 states have already registered 80,000 young voters, received over 108,000 commitments to vote, and knocked on over 360,000 doors. https://t.co/rmCCsqFd8x
✅Young people don't like Donald Trump and can be motivated to stop Trump and the GOP. 		✅ Emphasizing the untapped power young people have by virtue of being the largest voting bloc in America is very powerful and can overcome barriers to political participation.
We've gone deeper than traditional what-issues-matter-to-you polling, exploring core attitudes that shape and inhibit political participation by young people. We found a couple things that hold true for young Americans, regardless of their demographic or attitudinal differences:
Over 70 million people under 35 years old will be eligible to vote in the 2018 midterms, making young Americans the largest voting bloc in the U.S. and integral to flipping Congress. @jim_newell breaks down our research on young voters here. https://t.co/cAtXXGfVzL

Just this week, one partner organization, the UC Immigrant Legal Services Center, released a toolkit to share its model and best practices with other schools who want to support their immigrant students and families. https://t.co/iemROHVQRx
Through this program, our partners have represented over 800 immigrants, recruited over 1,500 lawyers and volunteers to join the Immigration Justice Campaign, and provided technical assistance for almost 4,000 cases.
The network includes 11 organizations that are geographically diverse and vary in scope.
Last year, @TomSteyer invested $2.3 million through NextGen America to support organizations responding to the surge in demand for immigration legal services driven by the cruel and arbitrary decisions of the Trump admin.
We will not stand idly by while our immigrant brothers and sisters continue to be attacked. Today at @ailanational #AILAAC18 conference, @TomSteyer announced an additional $1 million commitment to expand our work to protect the immigrant community. https://t.co/Qli3Vpb2vD
