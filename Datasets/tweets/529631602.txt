Hey Meghan, 	Allie said she was proud of the conversations she was part of. 	As you know she wasn’t part of Malkins speech.	Many people, including me were disgusted with Michelle’s comments.	Maybe you should comment this on her post, and not Allies... Anything for retweets tho. https://t.co/MilF3203MZ

So I met @louiescataglia for the first time this week.... Before he even said hello to me, he had the audacity to just say “Wayne Simmonds”.... 	He knows i’m still not taking this news well

CPAC was absolutely amazing! I can’t wait to be back next year!!

@cam_wallaceee @KyleKashuv this isn’t normal?
@endofanerajc my guess is @TheAmandaKemp said this?
As a person who is very vocal about his sexuality, and knew I was going to be meeting a lot of my twitter friends this week, there is no place I would have felt more accepted than at CPAC!		The thought that conservatives hate the gay community is false!

We live in a society where we believe men are never the victims to sexual assault.
We live in a society where we give a voice to those who call victims to sexual assault, weak and stupid.
We live in a society where we expect women to be brave, and men to be braver, and to brush off their attacks.	DON’T BRUSH IT OFF. 	Even if you don’t want to report it to authorities, tell a friend, or family member. Don’t go through this alone.
There are so many more statistics out there.	The number for reported rapes by women is very low, and even lower for male victims.
27.8% of reported males, were first victimized at age 10 or younger.		15% of college men are forced into sex.
52.4% of male victims reported the attack happened by an intimate partner, or acquaintance.		15.1% by a stranger
Men who have experienced sexual assault are at higher risks of:	- PTSD and depression	- Alcoholism, and drug abuse	- Suicidal thoughts, and attempts 	- Underachievement in school and work	- Problems in intimate replationships
14.2% of US adult males who reported, were sexually assaulted before the age of 18.
1 out of every 10 rape victims is male.		0.6% of active duty men experience unwanted sexual conduct.		Of the 14,900, 17% of males reported.
As of 1998, 2.78 million males were victims of an attempted, or completed rape.		1 in 33 men have experienced an attempted, or completed rape/sexual assault in their lifetime.
I just want to drop some statistics because it’s a very important discussion to have.
At work today talking to a co-worker about sexual assault, and another co-worker chimed in, and said men are never victims of sexual assault.	That’s not true, and unfortunately it seems to be a topic that is pushed aside by so many.
A thread:		I apologize if anyone is hurt by this thread. I apologize if it brings up things that happened to you. My intention is only to bring light to the topic.

There are so many other people on here that I could name, but there are so many it would take a very long time! 	Thank you to everyone who has been on the journey with me!	Here’s to 2019!
Calli is someone who has reached out to me multiple times when she has seen tweets of me going through some serious stuff, and just the gesture of reaching out goes a very long way! I’m so grateful to know her! Love you girl!
Last one I’m doing is @CalliNorton!	I met Calli in 2017 in DC, and from the moment I met her I knew she was one of the hardest working people I’ve ever met. After a mistake I made in a GC her and I weren’t friends. Thankfully I bettered myself, and she gave me a second chance.
@jordylancaster Hey girl! Jordan published my “controversial” pro same sex marriage adoption article to Right Outlook, after HDI refused.	She’s funny, smart, and sweet! 	She puts up with Ian and I’m not sure how she does that 😂😂 I appreciate her friendship!
@msnicolemaria and @FunkyFreedom are mom and dad, and I don’t know what is better than that! But in all seriousness I love them both! They are two of the sweetest people I’ve met on here!
Next up is @endofanerajc! She’s an amazing mental health advocate, and will help anyone who needs it. She is always open to listen when you need to talk. She’s also hilarious so idk how anyone could not like her!
He’s funny, doesn’t put up with peoples bullshit, or hypocrisy, isn’t afraid to call you out, but is also very supportive!
Now onto @itplol... Everyone knows Ian for his calling out of multiple people! Honestly when I first followed Ian, I thought he was a complete asshole. @kylie_thomas can confirm that😂 but then I took her advice and gave him a chance, and he’s actually a really nice guy!
Coming up next is @morganisawizard! Her and I used to have disagreements on twitter. I’m pretty sure I could find tweets of us going back and forth. Well she has become one of my favorite people on this sight, and she helped me come forward against HDI over the summer!
Next is @morganbsachs! She’s been an amazing friend to me since I met through PragerU. She’s such an amazing person, and has a huge heart! She will always be there for anyone who needs her.
First off let me name @kylie_thomas! I met here in 2017 at a conference, and I just appreciate her more than words can describe! She stuck by me as a friend after I made a huge mistake. I love her forever! 💙❤️
Now onto the people who I have become close with!
Here we are in December now, and I have started applying for multiple jobs, and internships within politics! Fingers crossed something comes about!
In July I was offered an amazing position working for @YALiberty for their Operation Win At The Door! I went to Florida to campaign for a Liberty minded Conservative! It was an amazing experience that I will forever be thankful for!
After just a few months Devon took a chance, and offered me a Gold Leader spot. She had faith that I would be able to connect with a group of like minded individuals to help further the conservative message! For that I am thankful!!
I want to say thank you first to @prageru, @DevonMirsky, and @LibertyLikes! I joined PragerU earlier this year! Since I joined everyone involved has become like a second family to me! They support me, and have always been there!
I had some amazing opportunities this year to further my dream of politics.
As 2018 is coming to a close, I have much to be thankful for.	This year I started working on myself.	I started changing who I was, and bettering myself from before.	I met many people along the way, and I found so many people I can trust and lean on.
A huge thank you to @DevonMirsky for this! It means the world to me, to have your support! I am so happy to have found @prageru! Merry Christmas! https://t.co/U5w7lCAHQl

Believe in what you feel inside	And give your dreams the wings to fly	You have everything you need	If you just believe		Trains move quickly	To their journey's end	Destinations	Are where we begin again

@louiescataglia I’m waiting for him to become the next Turning Point spokesperson tbh.
@aaronjcarpenter The Black community has been walking away from the Democratic Party for a long time, it just wasn’t broadcasted all over the news until Kanye spoke up. But not Kanye is saying he doesn’t support what he has been saying. He isn’t a conservative.
Nah I’m pretty sure @cam_wallaceee is hating on TPUSA because they aren’t the organization they once were. Myself along with Cam, and many others fell in love with Turning Point, but they don’t care about their values anymore. They are bad for our movement. https://t.co/ZxSCyXHGMJ
@morganbsachs @itplol @RoseLaoutaris And that they only care about continuing to prop up Charlie and Candace.
@morganbsachs @itplol @RoseLaoutaris Personally I think the college activist still involved should cut all ties with them. Charlie said the greatest thing to happen to TPUSA was Candace Owens. Not the activist that keep it going. So by staying involved they are agreeing that their work “doesn’t matter”.
