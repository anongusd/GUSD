The incomparable ⁦@mikeallen⁩ settles in to provide his great insights at the top of the ⁦@Morning_Joe⁩ 7am hour. https://t.co/tzdfL6HQpq
Another edition of ⁦@Morning_Joe⁩ starts in just a few minutes — with charts on the elusive 3% economic growth. https://t.co/LxBvfdG3Bu
While 2.9% Y/Y for the year is indeed a solid growth rate, it still comes up short of the WH promise of 3%+ through 2024 (they’re calling for 3.2% in 2019). Compare this to all other forecasters who see 2.5% or below for the current year and for 2020 &amp; beyond, sub 2.0%. https://t.co/9PY1jUpzoG
For the year, Trump came close . . . but not quite the 3%+ that “no one said he could do”.  	P.S.: The result matches Obama’s 2015 2.9% year. 	P.S.S.: 2.9% is all we got with a full year tax cut stimulus. https://t.co/lHyts2kFmH
So much for Trump’s “hottest economy in the world”.  While 4Q real GDP comes in above expectations (at 2.6% vs. 2.2% est), it marks a notable sequential slowdown. What can we expect in the current quarter? J.P.Morgan is calling for 1.5%. https://t.co/CZ5JpLEuri
As the piece says, it’s just like John Dean and Watergate (and I am old enough to remember.) But it wasn’t for another year and the release of the tapes until Nixon resigned.		https://t.co/33Q7WwNNO9

The impact of the 2017 tax cut law is clearly evident in home prices; a meaningful slowdown in appreciation has unfolded in markets where the SALT deduction is more heavily relied on. My @Morning_Joe chart: https://t.co/xFpCJakskt
In the 2016 election, the heaviest users of the SALT deduction were in states that Clinton won.  Accordingly, the TCJA’s limitation of the deduction to $10k has disproportionately hurt residents of “blue states”.  My @Morning_Joe chart: https://t.co/2bQDIS9XGO

According to Trump, “the wall is being built at a rapid pace”.  Not one inch of his wall has been built.  Further, of the $1.6bn approved last year for repairs &amp; fencing, only a 40% has been spent covering a fraction of the mileage he’s demanding. https://t.co/FTl28iaQPG https://t.co/pnRoLHyPXC

No, the US is not collecting billions of dollars in tariffs from China and other countries. Fact: tariffs are assessed to the US importer of record, so the only ones footing the bill are US companies and consumers.  #SOTU https://t.co/Xrap5wvjIL
Trump received a “Bottomless Pinocchio” by the @washingtonpost for claiming that a wall would stop drugs from “pouring in”.  The majority of illicit drugs arrive at the southern border via legal entry points where insufficient screening is the problem. https://t.co/xAKul5oEyH https://t.co/wtXBMWMFHA
According to Trump’s own State Dept, a 2017 report found “no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States”. Indeed, almost all suspects are apprehended at airports. #SOTU https://t.co/cen29Mpc0L

While it’s true manufacturers have hired 467k workers under Trump, it pales in comparison to the 6.1 mln jobs lost between ’98-’00.  #SOTU https://t.co/m2hoYdJjHy https://t.co/ZBKqphSbrm
No Trump hasn’t “accomplished more than any other president” -- only 44% of his promises have been kept or are underway which pales in comparison to Obama’s 70% at the 2-yr mark. #SOTU https://t.co/iRXDdXfwqD https://t.co/9cHAU7KcNP
A hallmark of Trump’s tax cut: record shareholder payouts that by 2Q18 topped a whopping $1trillion.  #SOTU https://t.co/UTp3lspY01
Indeed, the unemployment rate at 50-year low is a great headliner, however the downtrend is simply a continuation from the Obama administration who oversaw a 5.3-pnt decline from the peak vs. Trump’s 0.7-pnt improvement.  #SOTU https://t.co/l69ISYNefO https://t.co/PuTbZDyLAm
Hiring during Trump’s first 25 months (205k m/m on avg) is solid, but it’s slightly less than Obama’s final 25 month run-rate (212k). #SOTU https://t.co/SBiCaAVGUd https://t.co/zyA3jkAaTJ

The cost of Trump’s gov’t shutdown, which is quickly nearing the longest in history, far exceeds the price tag for his border wall.  A 2017 study by S&amp;P projected $6.5bn per week in lost economic activity.  	https://t.co/f86GLMW13M

Highly unlikely according to consensus.  Quarterly real GDP estimates from JPMorgan: 	3Q18: 3.5%	4Q18: 2.5% 	1Q19: 2.3% 	2Q19: 2.0%	3Q19: 1.8%	4Q19: 1.5% https://t.co/B3Ung6CNdL

A stand-out from today’s employment report was the constructive pop in earnings – up 0.4% m/m taking the y/y up to 2.9% for a cycle high. The struggle: the erosion from inflation which has more than offset this improvement. https://t.co/ExlfOpSP9M

Solid payroll print (up 201k m/m vs. expected 190k) tempered by 50k in downward revisions to prior months.  In short, a trend-like report with a notable pop in earnings (up 0.4% m/m taking the y/y up to 2.9%) and an unch u-rate.

For all those raving about the revival of manufacturing under Trump (given +31k jobs this month), note the LT decline in manufacturing jobs: ~5mm lost since 2000. They are gone not b/c of any POTUS but due to globalization &amp; automation. https://t.co/ZJgsV8uBL1
Wage gains (+2.5% YoY) continue to underwhelm. Despite a strong jobs market, wages have failed to reach their pre-recession levels: https://t.co/fn2kHGxQ7N
With economy firing on all cylinders, amazing that GOP felt compelled to pass a fiscal stimulus of tax cuts worth more than Obama’s stimulus during the Great Recession.
Another solid jobs report: 228k new jobs vs. est of 195k; Sept/Oct revisions added another 3k; unemployment rate steady at 4.1% https://t.co/XtELIQ8Lye

Despite repeal of SALT (which mostly benefits the wealthy), GOP #TaxPlan is very regressive. Top 20% will see their incomes rise 2% in 2019; bottom 20% will only see a 0.3% increase. My @Morning_Joe chart: https://t.co/YGOaJsdSxB
Repeal of SALT deduction would hurt Americans in blue states far more than those in red states. Residents of NY, CA, CT, NJ, DC would lose $3k - $4k on avg per year. My @Morning_Joe chart. #TaxPlan https://t.co/Xi06rs1w5S
