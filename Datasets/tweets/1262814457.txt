This is my last tweet from this account. It was an honor to serve the hardworking, resilient and caring people of Southern Minnesota in Congress. #MN01 has a bright future because of you all. Thank you for the opportunity to serve you.

Thanks to all who participated in our #MN01 listening tour. The Southern Minnesota Way of Life Report and Small Town and Regional Vitality Investment Act would not have been possible without your invaluable insight and expertise. https://t.co/Rv7ZlzjL3F
On behalf of #MN01, I am proud to release the Southern Minnesota Way of Life Report today. The report summarizes the constituent input my office and I heard over the last two years along our 21-county listening tour. https://t.co/Rv7ZlzjL3F
Many of the Senators who spoke tonight in favor of the bill said that the only thing standing in the way of Blue Water Navy veterans receiving the benefits they earned was the U.S. Senate. They are right.
It is especially troubling to see this bill blocked when there is so much work left to do on toxic exposures as a whole, to include those exposed to burn pits and radiologically exposed veterans.
But it’s disheartening to see a bill that passed unanimously by the House blocked by a handful of Senators over supposed fiscal concerns when those same Senators voted to add trillions of dollars to the deficit last year to score a political win on the back of American taxpayers.
I have been working on this bill since it was first introduced several Congresses ago. We have come a long way and are almost at the finish line.
All too often politicians will say that veterans deserve everything we can give them and more; that we owe veterans a debt we can never repay.  Well, today we saw politicians fail to live up to those promises and renege on paying that debt.
The U.S. Government wrote this check to the Blue Water Navy veterans 40 years ago when we exposed these service members to Agent Orange.  It’s far past time for us to pay up and live up to the trust that these men and women put in their government.
I am incredibly disappointed by the Republican Senator who blocked this bipartisan bill over supposed fiscal concerns. https://t.co/NspYiAT4Gl
Today we remember and pay tribute to the brave men and women who lost their lives 77 years ago at Pearl Harbor. We will never forget their selfless courage or the sacrifices they made to protect our democracy and freedom around the world. https://t.co/baC1ofmElL
Congrats to VA researchers Dr. McKee &amp; Dr. Wyss-Coray on being named among TIME's most influential people in healthcare! Their work will help improve the lives of #veterans as well as the entire world's approach to treating brain injuries and memory loss. https://t.co/TUMzBZubGL
This is fundamentally unacceptable and is an affront to the freedoms our veterans put their lives on the line to defend. There is no room for racism in our VA, our government or our country. Period. https://t.co/bzKT6UyQN5
My congressional offices are closed today to honor the life and service of President George H.W. Bush. On this National Day of Mourning, the hearts and condolences of a grateful nation go out to the entire Bush family.
Our veterans deserve their #GIBill payments on time &amp; in the amount they were promised. When VA fails to do this, then it’s on VA to make veterans whole again. A veteran should never be forced to suffer as a result of a VA failure, that’s why its on @SecWilkie to make this right.
The lack of clarity coming from @SecWilkie &amp; @DeptVetAffairs is absolutely unacceptable. One day they’re telling Congress they have no intention to retroactively repay these veterans, the next day they say they will. This obfuscation cannot go on. https://t.co/Ju5kHmWocI
On Friday, I joined my Democratic colleagues in sending a letter to @SecWilkie demanding clarity for the thousands of student veterans who’ve been underpaid their #GIBill benefits. https://t.co/2yVcMwoSgt
I am deeply saddened to hear of President George H.W. Bush’s passing. I will always be thankful for his patriotism &amp; lifelong dedication to public service. To the entire Bush family, know a grateful nation is grieving with you during this difficult time. https://t.co/DudXZFcoiw
This is an unacceptable betrayal of our veterans. President Trump and  Secretary Wilkie must do everything in their power to make these veterans whole again. https://t.co/aeO78Hjn0R
My heart breaks for the three American soldiers killed in Ghazni. My sincere condolences go out to their families during this difficult time and they will be in my prayers. May the service and sacrifice of these brave soldiers never be forgotten. https://t.co/XvaXO9xlRy
Our brave transgender troops are not a burden — they are American heroes. Their selfless service and sacrifice should be welcomed, honored and celebrated.		This discriminatory ban weakens our national security and undercuts our national values. It must not stand. https://t.co/YKnDUkGWL9
#HappyThanksgiving to our service members and their families, including @TheRedBulls and all our troops serving away from home this year. We are #thankful for your sacrifice.
They have dedicated their careers to serving veterans and as a veteran myself I could not be more thankful. https://t.co/vbN77OYvOl
Serving as the Ranking Democrat on the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee has been an honor and a privilege. I could not be more proud of the work we’ve accomplished to improve the lives of veterans and I know none of it would have been possible without my incredible staff. https://t.co/4IRfVb2hoD

The Pope is right. Health is a right, not a privilege. From increasing access to lowering costs, we have a lot of work ahead of us, and solidifying protections for folks with preexisting conditions is a critical part of moving forward.
Earl Bakken was a true giant of medical technology whose work improved the health and lives of so many. My heart goes out to his entire family following his passing. https://t.co/W8YOKkS8VI
If the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act is not signed into law before the end of this year, then our bipartisan work will be undone and these #veterans will be back to square one. Now is the time to act. Now is the time to bring this critical legislation to a vote.
This bipartisan bill would grant nearly 90,000 veterans who served off the coast of Vietnam &amp; who suffer from illnesses resulting from their exposure to Agent Orange the benefits they deserve. These vets have waited 40 years &amp; time is running out. https://t.co/MkkXBgZIih
This week, I led 45 Members of Congress in sending a letter to Senator Isakson, Chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, urging him to schedule a vote on the bipartisan Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, which passed the House 382-0 in June. https://t.co/2ImwU9X5Ma
Our deepest condolences go out to the family of John Hoffmann and we continue to pray for the health of Kaleb Fischer. Our thoughts are with the loved-ones and all who have been impacted by these tragic accidents. https://t.co/zf0CEx69WV
When our country faces epidemics of veteran suicide and homelessness, the last thing we should do is take away $10 billion from @DeptVetAffairs. Veterans should not get budget cuts after giving tax cuts to billionaires and corporations. https://t.co/Tm5ElFSiFP
Both parties are responsible for getting our fiscal house in order but the GOP’s push to cut Medicare and Social Security in the name of fiscal responsibility — after having skyrocketed the deficit with tax cuts for the 1% and corporations — is so wrong. https://t.co/hMv6Q1kZTO

Great work by @DemocracyFwd for holding the Trump Admin accountable for unlawfully withholding documents that could reveal the extent of Mar-a-Lago's influence over VA.

We have a lot of hard work ahead of us but when it comes to turning the tide on the veteran suicide epidemic, we must never give up. #WorldMentalHealthDay https://t.co/xDnYB8UNAI
Congress also needs to build upon the Clay Hunt SAV Act, a law I wrote to increase vets’ access to mental health care, increase VA capacity to meet demand, improve quality of care, boost VA accountability, and develop a community support system for vets. #WorldMentalHealthDay
I introduced the VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act to authorize VA research into the efficacy of medicinal cannabis use by vets with PTSD and chronic pain. #WorldMentalHealthDay https://t.co/MnYPn4MGJi
While no one solution will be enough, there are a number of steps we must take to move the ball forward in the fight to save the lives of our veterans. For one, Congress needs to pass my VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act. #WorldMentalHealthDay
#WorldMentalHealthDay is a day to rededicate ourselves to caring for our own mental health and the mental health of others, including our nation’s veterans living with PTSD and TBI.
#WorldMentalHealthDay is a day to tear down the stigmas tied to mental illness and open our hearts and minds to our neighbors who live with mental health challenges. No one should have to fear opening up about a mental health condition because of how others might treat them.
VA’s refusal to cooperate with this inquiry is absolutely unacceptable. This issue has reeked of cronyism and corruption since the beginning and will remain a top concern until all our questions are answered. Trump &amp; VA can’t be allowed to sweep this under the rug. https://t.co/KroqTcfKyw

Labor Day is more than a day off, it is about honoring the millions of Americans who are the backbone of our economy and our nation. This year, as Trump attacks labor rights across the US, our fight to ensure workers are treated w/ dignity and respect is more important than ever.
Senator John McCain embodied what Americans ought to expect from our leaders: decency, civility, and respect. We are forever in his debt and it’s up to us to carry on his legacy of patriotism.
Our strength as Americans lies in our unity. Together, we stand strong. Divided, we fall. Senator McCain didn't just believe in this fundamental American truth, he lived it all the days of his life.
Senator McCain understood that we are first and foremost Americans. During his memorial service today, that sentiment rang all throughout the Cathedral.
While alone in the Capitol early this morning, I had the privilege to give one final salute to a close friend &amp; mentor. The life of @SenJohnMcCain embodied the American spirit and I will be forever grateful for his service, sacrifice, and leadership. God speed my friend. https://t.co/L3c3dBfYCa

We can both ensure vets have access to high quality and timely healthcare and defend against cuts and privatization of VA. I stand ready to work with Republicans and Democrats to fix the VA MISSION Act funding shortfall in a way that doesn’t put other key VA programs at risk.
Congress has until the end of FY2019 to find a solution to the VA MISSION Act funding shortage. Regrettably, multiple proposals offered by my fellow Democrats and me to fix the funding issues have yet to be advanced, leaving critical existing VA services at risk of cuts.
As it stands, current budget caps won’t allow for the level of spending the VA MISSION Act calls for ($47B) without deep cuts to other vital VA programs, such as those that invest in VA infrastructure, direct patient care, suicide prevention, medical research, and job training.

If these revelations prove true, then VA is being secretly run from the shadows of Mar-a-Lago by men with no accountability to taxpayers and who have never served in the United States military or government. This is textbook corruption and cronyism. https://t.co/lnq3xTbJlE

It has long been one of my top priorities to ensure that our veterans are finding careers that utilize their skills, support their families, and let them feel passionate about what they do. The #VET2FARMact helps do just that for the many vets out there whose passion is farming.
Thank you to @KarlTowns and all the athletes who have stood up and shown our nation’s kids what real leadership looks like. The president’s attacks on our fellow Americans are rooted in hate and we must never allow them to be normalized.

The other good news is that countless rural MN communities hold immense promise for growth and development. It’s long past time the federal government properly invests in the promise of our small towns – and listen to local leaders in their respective communities on how to do so.
By ensuring that all veterans are eligible for support from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and enabling community partners to work with veterans interested in farming, the #VET2FARMact will help veterans earn jobs in agriculture following their military service. #VET2FARM

Every MN senior must have access to a trusted, high-quality #Medicare option that meets their needs.		I urge swift passage of our bill and will continue to fight for MN seniors by protecting their Medicare from disruption and Republican attempts to target the program for cuts.
Our unanswered 2017 requests of the Trump admin include:	 	• the steps CMS has taken to provide flexibility and info to Minnesotans	• the steps CMS will be taking to ensure a timely notice of #Medicare changes	• details from CMS on the regulatory options to limit disruption
Currently, over half of all #Medicare Cost plan beneficiaries live in MN. As it stands, an estimated 300k+ Medicare recipients in 70 of MN’s 87 counties will be transitioning from Medicare Cost plans to Medicare Advantage plans on January 1, 2019 if the transition is not delayed.
Our legislation to #ProtectMedicare will delay the transition of #Medicare Cost plan beneficiaries to Medicare Advantage plans from 2019 to 2021.	 	We owe Minnesota seniors the answers, direction, peace of mind, and health coverage and care they deserve.
Due to the Trump administration’s failure to address concerns we raised in 2017 about the potential disruption of health coverage for over 300,000 Minnesota seniors, Rep. Collin Peterson and I are introducing the #ProtectMedicare for Seniors Act of 2018 today.

I have serious concerns regarding Robert Wilkie’s judgment given his role in the Trump administration’s ban on #transtroops. Our vets need a VA Secretary that is going to care for all our heroes including #transvets.

Planned Parenthood serves 68k Minnesotans every year, and has provided care for over 30 million people nationwide, including 1 in 5 women.		@realDonaldTrump’s new attack on #TitleX impedes access to all kinds of care, from cancer screenings to STD testing. https://t.co/sjYQMMSrcx

In MN alone, 16k vets receive #SNAP benefits. If we let one be denied the basic human necessity of a meal, we are failing as a nation.	 	I implore the #HouseAg GOP &amp; @SpeakerRyan to strengthen &amp; #ProtectSNAP, not create barriers to access for vets who rely on it. #2018FarmBill
#SNAP is the most effective anti-hunger program in US history, and that includes helping keep many of our warriors from going hungry when they return home.	 	It’s indefensible that the GOP would risk forcing a veteran to go hungry. #2018FarmBill
To keep our ag economy strong, the #2018FarmBill must help transfer skills, knowledge &amp; land between current &amp; future generations of farmers. My #BeginningFarmer and Rancher Opportunity Act will do just that. Learn more: https://t.co/HVYv5SAnVC
Nearly 100 million acres of farmland (enough to support ~250k family farms) is set to change hands over the next five years. The #HouseAg GOP is making a big mistake by failing to work with Dems to adequately invest in the next generation of farmers &amp; ranchers. #2018FarmBill
A few yrs ago Rushford was hit by a devastating flood. Facing high costs, a local grocery store applied for a REAP grant which helped them install state of the art, energy efficient freezers &amp; coolers - lowering their monthly energy bill by $330. This is why REAP is so critical.
The Rural Energy for America Program is a big deal for our small towns. Cutting these energy efficiency &amp; renewable energy grants/loans would hurt farmers and rural small businesses. That’s why I adamantly oppose the elimination of REAP funding in the #HouseAg GOP #2018FarmBill.
Instead of cutting working lands programs by ~$5B as the GOP #2018FarmBill prescribes, we should support farmers by enhancing programs like CSP &amp; EQIP. That’s why I wrote the #SOILStewardshipAct.	 	Learn how my bill improves soil health &amp; water quality: https://t.co/DeAaIOxvqm

The VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act of 2018 is a pragmatic &amp; #bipartisan piece of legislation that will help improve &amp; save the lives of #veterans across the country. Read my full statement w/ @DrPhilRoe, @RepLouCorrea, &amp; @SenatorTester here: https://t.co/wrR2XVWcPd
I proudly stand with the 92% of veterans who support research into #MedicinalCannabis &amp; call on @DeptVetAffairs to make advancing this research a top priority. https://t.co/LehOWZTF2z
Simply put, there is no department or organization better suited to conduct this critically important research than @DeptVetAffairs, and there will never be a better time to #DoTheResearch.
22% of vets report using cannabis as a safer &amp; more effective alternative to opioids &amp; drug cocktails currently prescribed by VA for PTSD or chronic pain; yet, there has been a severe lack of research studying the full effect of #MedicinalCannabis on vets. https://t.co/4bkmZ97ix9
I'm proud to introduce the #bipartisan VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act of 2018 alongside @DrPhilRoe &amp; @RepLouCorrea. The bill authorizes VA to advance research into the safety of #MedicinalCannabis use on #veterans suffering from #PTSD &amp; #ChronicPain https://t.co/dzApOCGBmw

I applaud the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force &amp; POTUS for meeting, &amp; echo the Task Force’s call for action. 	 	@SpeakerRyan, bring commonsense gun safety legislation like background checks, CDC research &amp; an assault weapons ban to the floor. Let Congress do the people’s work.

The #TrumpBudget includes a mere $100K for the Lewis &amp; Clark Regional Water System, a drastic cut from last yr. To live up to the fed govt’s commitment to our rural SW MN communities, POTUS should be upping fed funds, not gutting them. Rural water must be a top priority. #LCRWS

Our vets deserve the peace of mind that comes w/ knowing the programs they rely on for care won’t be ransacked when the GOP goes looking to clean up after their #GOPTaxScam mess. I'll keep fighting until we get a long-term funding solution for HR4242 both parties can support. 5/5
Yesterday in the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs markup of the VA Care in the Community Act, Republicans moved forward with a vote on HR4242 without the inclusion of a long-term funding solution. As a result, I could not in good conscience vote for the bill as written. 4/
This type of funding uncertainty is why I support the inclusion of a long-term funding solution in HR4242, the VA Care in the Community Act. Doing so would help safeguard community care funding for our veterans from potential Republican-proposed cuts in the future. 3/
It's also estimated that the #GOPTaxScam would add $2.2 trillion to the deficit. In order to pay back the money they recklessly borrowed, Republicans in Congress will likely try to cut vital programs like Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and potentially even VA programs. 2/
83% of the tax cuts in the #GOPTaxScam would go to the wealthiest 1% of Americans while 86 million middle class families would see their taxes increase. This is, in part, why I voted against the bill twice in two days. 1/

#NetNeutrality prevents big corporations from telling us what we can and can’t access online. This is why it's so important. This is why we must keep fighting to defend it. #SaveNetNeutrality
Without #NetNeutrality, small businesses and innovators in Minnesota could lose out to big corporations that can outspend them for internet access. @AjitPaiFCC and @FCC: keep the internet open, fair and free! #SaveNetNeutrality
Health insurance Open Enrollment ends Jan. 14 in Minnesota, but if you need coverage by Jan. 1, you have until Dec. 20. Spread the word and don't delay! #GetCovered #MN01
#NetNeutrality is one of the most important free speech issues of our time. If you love our freedom to express views and hear the views of others without interference, join me in telling @AjitPaiFCC and the @FCC to #SaveNetNeutrality!
In addition to raising taxes on working families, the #GOPTaxScam could trigger steep cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, public education and job training. I ask my Republican colleagues, are your tax cuts for big donors, the uber-rich and corporations really worth it?

Through the #BeginningFarmer and Rancher Opportunity Act of 2017, we can ensure the next #FarmBill is truly a Farm Bill for the next generation! #BFROA
The #BFROA would:		✅Expand #beginningfarmers’ access to affordable land	✅Empower new farmers w skills to succeed in today’s ag economy	✅Ensure equitable access to financial capital &amp; federal crop insurance	✅Encourage commitment to conservation &amp; stewardship across generations
By promoting access to land, making credit readily available, and funding world class research and education programs, the #BeginningFarmer and Rancher Opportunity Act works to do just that. #BFROA
To accomplish this goal, we must provide young Americans with the training and tools they need to take up and keep up farms of their own. #BeginningFarmers #BFROA
It is among our top priorities as a nation to ensure our next generation of #farmers is able to provide the U.S. and the world with a safe, abundant food supply. #BeginningFarmers #BFROA

“~300k vets benefitted from the Work Opportunity Tax Credit between 2013 &amp; 2015... [&amp;] the Disabled Access Credit is a vital tool in helping small businesses abide by the #ADA” - @PVA1946		#TaxReform must serve to help all our vets, not hamper their pursuit of the American Dream. https://t.co/PnUzE9HqYP
I stand with @PVA1946 in support of #taxreform that works for all our veterans and Americans with disabilities. Ending the Work Opportunity Tax Credit - as the #GOPTaxBill does along with the Disabled Access Credit - would be a huge disservice to our vets seeking employment. https://t.co/4USdaCVggw

We didn’t need a #CBOscore to know how awful #TrumpCare’s #Medicaid cuts would be for #rural #nursinghomes, #hospitals, children &amp; seniors.
According to the #CBOscore, premiums would increase by around 20% for single folks in 2018 under the Senate GOP #TrumpCare plan.
Senate GOP’s #TrumpCare could make insurance even more expensive for #rural folks already being hit hard on the individual market. #CBOscore
Per the #CBOscore, 15 million more folks would be without health insurance in 2018 under the Senate GOP #TrumpCare plan
Per the #CBOscore, 4 million folks would lose their employer-based health insurance in 2018 under the Senate GOP #TrumpCare plan.
There are #22millionreasons why I could never support Senate GOP’s #TrumpCare: 22M more folks will be w/o health insurance by 2026 #CBOscore

I’ll never stop fighting for Minnesota's children &amp; their families against the morally indefensible cuts of the GOP's #AHCA &amp; #TrumpBudget.
Under the Republicans' #AHCA, folks w/ #PreexistingConditions could lose legal protections &amp; see costs skyrocket. #iamapreexistingcondition
If @realDonaldTrump gets his way, the #TrumpBudget would cut #Medicaid by over $800 billion. These coldhearted #TrumpCuts cannot stand.
If the GOP’s #AHCA becomes law, 219,718 Minnesotans w/ disabilities are at risk of losing their #Medicaid healthcare coverage. Unacceptable.
.@realDonaldTrump &amp; the GOP’s #TrumpBudget &amp; #AHCA would be catastrophic for Minnesotans on #Medicaid and/or with #PreexistingConditions.
@GilletteChildrn Thank you to these inspiring children, their families &amp; @GilletteChildrn for sharing their stories &amp; ideas. I will continue to fight for you https://t.co/t7z0nJiSTO

I’m proud to stand w/ southern Minnesotans &amp; folks across Main Street America against the GOP’s Wall Street handout, the #WrongChoiceAct. https://t.co/bjJFR343jZ
Wall Street &amp; its GOP friends in Congress are working hard to let big banks once again take huge risks that end up hurting Minnesotans.
GOP’s #WrongChoiceAct would also negatively impact #CFPB, which helps protect MN #seniors #servicemembers &amp; #vets from financial predators.
GOP’s #WrongChoiceAct doesn’t do that. It rolls back #DoddFrank protections &amp; destroys safeguards that could stop another financial crisis.
Rural areas need access to capital. We could increase access by modifying laws on rural lending – w/o letting Wall Street run amok again.
That's why I’ve supported bills in every Congress to ease the burden on small MN financial institutions, neighborhood banks &amp; credit unions.
While it helped rein in Wall Street &amp; stabilize our economy, #DoddFrank wasn’t perfect – especially for MN community banks &amp; credit unions.
#DoddFrank was passed in part to limit the risky business of Wall Street &amp; big financial firms that led to the 2008 financial crisis.

Together, we can defeat @POTUS &amp; the #GOP’s heartless #AHCA. For the health &amp; wellbeing of our fellow Americans, we must. #LiveOurDemocracy
I call on southern Minnesotans and all Americans to welcome their families, friends, loved-ones and neighbors to take part in our democracy!
We can’t just fend for ourselves; we must fight for each other! We can’t just live our lives; we must #LiveOurDemocracy!
As the late, great U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone said, “We all do better when we all do better.” And to all do better, we must all do more!
We must improve our health care system, but the right and just way to do so is by working together with compassion for our fellow Americans.
.@POTUS &amp; the #GOP’s #AHCA is not the law of the land, &amp; I believe if we continue to speak out with one resounding voice, it never will be.
While @POTUS &amp; the #GOP’s #AHCA passed the House today, our fight to protect seniors, children, veterans &amp; working families is not over.
Thank you to all the southern Minnesotans who shared your views on #AHCA with me. Here’s my statement on voting NO: https://t.co/1eq9m45Xeu https://t.co/IlQ9yKN4kQ

Our healthcare system isn’t perfect. It must be improved now to address instability &amp; costs in MN’s individual market. #AHCA fails this test

I cannot support any proposed #ACA fix or replacement that would add to the high insurance costs many rural Minnesotans are already facing.
Any proposed #ACA fix or replacement should expand coverage to Americans, not take health insurance away from those who need it the most.
