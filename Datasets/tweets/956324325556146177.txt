"We need new lenses in Congress or we will continue to fail."
"To buy my son a case of diapers would cost an hour of work if the minimum wage WAS $15. Here in Delaware it takes 2 hours."
Wages have not kept up with the cost of living for decades now. The federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 for nearly ten years now, and when President Obama tried to give workers a modest boost to $10 in 2014, Senator Carper blocked him.
"The athletes who are kneeling on the field are fighting oppressions that have gone on for too long. I'm proud to stand with them."

"When you see things through the same lens as everyone else you get people like Brett Kavanaugh and Alex Azar because someone in your network said he was a good guy at Yale. This is a problem."
Senator Carper was one of 4 Democratic Senators who voted to confirm Kavanaugh in 2006 and the only one remaining in the Senate. https://t.co/QtuP5APOuF
"With all due respect, Senator Carper, your vote to confirm Kavanaugh is being used by Republicans right now to paint him as a moderate."
Kavanaugh is the wrong choice. The Supreme Court is the last line of defense for the rights of the minority. Kavanaugh has shown time and time again that he does not respect the rights of women, workers, and the most vulnerable among us.
"We need trade that builds up people. We need trade strategies that are planned out, that are actually a strategy. We need trade that builds better lives."
Kerri fought against the Dodd-Frank rollback. Senator Carper voted for it. https://t.co/iIwj6DWsnI
Carper sided with banks to gut consumer protections for working families seeking to declare bankruptcy: https://t.co/dtJ0CPRGGE
We need to strengthen our middle class and put people over profits. Enough is enough.
Senator Carper says there are ways for young people to find the means to pay for college, but we have seen time and time again this just isn't true for too many who are being left behind and failed by systemic inequality.
"If we want to bail out not only our students, but our economy, I say we need to eliminate student debt and start fresh."
"Healthcare is a human right, and we need elected officials who will roll up their sleeves and figure out how to pay for it."
Carper said that importing drugs from Canada would not be safe (Canadians disagreed). That election cycle, he raked in $316,110 from Big Pharma: https://t.co/xmJX8PvgUh

At the Metropolitan Wilmington Urban League, I work with at-risk students in local schools. Our schools need more resources so that we can put our children first: mental &amp; physical healthcare &amp; after school programs.
I want to make sure gun background checks are consistent across the United States.
The NRA‚Äôs Hearing Protection Act argues that gun silencers protect shooters‚Äô hearing. But police oppose this legislation because it will endanger us.
I am a veteran, and I know too well how the bullet from a high-powered weapon tears through body after body. It pains me to have to talk to my daughter about what to do during a school shooting.
We need to streamline our immigration process because people want to immigrate here legally. Immigration makes our country strong. We need comprehensive immigration reform.
Spending money on the border wall makes no sense. It does not work. We need to spend money on our communities.
In the military I served with DACA recipients. They were willing to put their lives on the line for you, for all of us.
Diversity is what makes the United States as great as it is. The president gives his wife &amp; her family special immigration privileges, but he does not think the rest of immigrants deserve the same rights.
Who determines who has the right to immigrate to the United States? My great-grandfather immigrated here from Sweden.
We absolutely can afford Medicare For All. The cost of not having universal healthcare is too high.
If the person who is in office says they do not have the ability to fight for what our communities need, we need to vote them out of office.
I will never support privatizing the VA. We need to expand VA benefits. We need dental coverage! And we need more locations. I agree with expanding it so that vets can visit small doctors offices. We need a Medicare For All system so that we all have access to healthcare.
Trickle-down economics do not work. Corporations are making record profits while we struggle to make ends meet. When people do better corporations do better, but we‚Äôve never seen it work in reverse.
Privatization does not benefit people, it benefits corporations.
Incentives we give to corporations help corporations, not Delawareans.
Great turnout tonight at the Senate debate tonight! Watch the livestream at https://t.co/HX2oovaMZg https://t.co/dSar3MqNUg
We deserve to be cared for, not because we want handouts, but because we want our communities to thrive.
We all know that our government spends too much money. But the problem is that our spending priorities are wrong.
We don‚Äôt have many job options in Kent County. We need to provide Delawareans with good job options.
We do not have high-speed internet in Sussex County. We need infrastructure.
It is our duty to make sure that every senior is treated with the respect they deserve. The must protect &amp; expand social security benefits.
Our social security is sound, but they can‚Äôt gamble with our money. We need to expand benefits. Our seniors served our country for decades, and they deserve to be cared for.
There is a place for tariffs and sanctions, but there has to be a clear plan. Our foreign policy cannot be determined by a Twitter war.
Livestream from tonight‚Äôs GHADA Senate debate: https://t.co/HX2oovaMZg
Our current administration is destroying alliances with our foreign allies.
As a veteran, I see firsthand how our foreign policy has failed us. We arm foreign regimes, and this backfires on us time and time again, and causes loss of life. We need diplomacy first.
Regardless of the community I visit, people are concerned about the same thing: rising cost of healthcare, low wages, and funding for our schools.

@StudioSpicy We must continue to fight--today and every day--against this administration's harmful agenda. We demand better, and we will keep fighting until we see our words turned into action.
@StudioSpicy Further, I would not vote to confirm ANY Supreme Court Justice nominated by DT until investigations were completed. We have far too much at stake to allow irreparable damage to our institutions.
@StudioSpicy I would first ensure that all necessary resources were given to investigating officials so that a sound and thorough investigation can occur. I would then urge my colleagues in the House to impeach upon it's completion and findings.
@StudioSpicy DTs willingness to meet privately with Putin while under investigation in itself undermines the trust the American people have in our system. Unfortunately, as a Senator I can not vote to impeach--I will only be able to participate in the trial.

@juliemcindoe Agree, Julie. It disenfranchises young people and low income people, and it was an unnecessary amendment. Delaware workers deserve better. Everyone deserves a living wage.

America should be forging peace deals and alliances, not further destabilizing the world.
This is an issue with decades of history; decades of displacement, decades of death. Although yesterday‚Äôs protests were not new, the idea that we as a nation now have blood on our hands due to our thoughtless actions is inexcusable and calls our very humanity into question.

@GirandzimArea52 Absolutely! Could not agree with you more.
@GirandzimArea52 You can also email us at info@kerrievelynharris.com or call 302 464 0649!
@GirandzimArea52 From knocking doors and getting out in the community, we've talked to a lot of people who would love to take advantage of resources, but they just don't know what's available. It's a travesty. We have to do better at getting that information to people.
@GirandzimArea52 That's a major issue. Believe we have to do a much better job at community outreach, coordination of services, and personal follow ups in order to make inroads there. Engagement is a definite area with room for improvement.
@GirandzimArea52 Absolutely, 100% agree! Feel free to DM if you would like to talk more with Kerri or someone from the team about this! Would love to get your thoughts.
@GirandzimArea52 Since people suffering from mental health issues are more likely to be victims of violence, we want to also make sure people have accurate statistics on that and avoid further stigmatizing vulnerable populations.
@GirandzimArea52 Hi Christopher - Kerri supports expanding mental health treatment, preventative measures, and early intervention. We want to be careful to also respect people's right to privacy, especially when it concerns medical information.

Those who will be most affected by these policies are often left out of the decision-making process; leaving their homes, cars, &amp; credit vulnerable to predatory practices. Most will only realize that their trust has been exploited after the damage has been done. #BankLobbyistAct
It is the DUTY of Senators from both sides of the aisle to vote against legislation that is in direct violation of their constituents‚Äô best interests. The #BankLobbyistAct is such a bill. #netDE
On the surface, S.2155 creates the impression that our economy and consumer protections will be enhanced, yet the bill text reveals that the biggest banks will gain substantial benefits while hard-working Americans will lose needed consumer protections. #BankLobbyistAct #netDE
