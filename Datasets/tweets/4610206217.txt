@PrincessBravato If they do not follow denuclearization. They are a blip on the screen they are but a moment in time they are history I respect your experience and defer to your opinion but I prefer a wait and see
Stupid Democrats treaties are presidents not for Congressional libtards the difference in this deal is they are a nuclear threat as never before and Trump would send them into oblivion each step of the process is going to be met with a president with a "bigger button"
Having reviewed their Christmas wish list, rushing at Kim with these demands would quickly sour the deal. Democrats please don't jinx the deal they know their country is in dire threat of being sent into Oblivion! #Trump doesn't fool around #TrumpKimSummit https://t.co/7NMxmxDBfv
