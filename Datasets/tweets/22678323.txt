US consumers and companies will most likely end up bearing the cost of the tariffs. The Tax Foundation said last year that it expects the tariffs to lower the gross domestic product and wages, and cost American jobs, hitting lower- and middle-income households the hardest.
Most of those tariffs are being paid by US companies that import those foreign goods. Often, US companies will pass the cost on to the consumer by raising prices, while other times a company will reduce compensation or employment internally to offset these higher costs.
CNN: Trump's line that China is paying billions of dollars in tariffs into the US Treasury is blatantly, unequivocally wrong.
The Reproductive Health Act, signed into law last month in New York, allows for abortion after 24 weeks if an authorized health care practitioner determines that "the abortion is necessary to protect the patient's life or health" or if "there is an absence of fetal viability."
The failed bill would have reduced the number of physicians needed to approve the abortion to one and removed "substantially and irremediably" from the language of justification for the abortion.
Under current VA law, third-trimester abortions can be performed only if three doctors agree the "pregnancy is likely to result in the death of the woman or substantially and irremediably impair the mental or physical health of the woman."
