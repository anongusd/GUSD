#5 HELP has been working w admin diligently for months to develop 7 areas of agreement for bill to actually achieve #interoperability
#4 GAO found many #meaningfuluse rules &amp; requirements for #EHRs are getting in the way of #interoperability.
#3 Some of leading U.S. medical institutions w/ best #EHRs recommended we take more time to develop the stage 3 rule.
#2 Top admin priority is changing way Medicare pays docs, basing on quality over quantity of care. Meaningful use will be 25% of score.
#1 Stage 2 is so complex that only 12% of docs and 40% of hospitals have been able to comply, stage 3 will make it even harder
.@SenAlexander: There is no reason not to take time to do it right, &amp; there are plenty of reasons to do this. Here are 5:
"Patients need an interoperable system that enables docs &amp; hospitals to share #EHRs, but govt, docs &amp; hospitals need time to do it right”
“The stage 3 requirements should then be phased in at a rate that reflects how successfully the program is being implemented”
“I’ve also asked administration to make rules final for stage 3 #meaningfuluse no sooner than January 1, 2017”
“I’ve urged modified rules for stage 2 should be adopted immediately to help docs, hospitals comply w govt’s requirements”
.@SenAlexander: Senate health committee has had 6 hearings on govt’s #meaningfuluse program because of problems with it.
“..so they &amp; health care providers have quicker, better access to health histories &amp; docs,hospitals &amp;pharmacists can provide better care”2/2
