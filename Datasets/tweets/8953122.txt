@craigtimes @ChrisHartline Congress wouldn‚Äôt vote on an FAQ, so its words have no official meaning. But even so, the FAQ talks about making air travel unnecessary because of a surge of investment in high-speed rail. That‚Äôs not the same as ending air travel.

@craigtimes @ChrisHartline Hi @ChrisHartline. That's been confusing. The FAQ is different from the resolution.  The Green New Deal resolution makes no mention of air travel. It calls for overhauling transportation systems including investment in high-speed rail.

@BernieSanders As long as the care comes from a doctor or at a hospital, the Canadian system covers the full cost. But the country‚Äôs public insurance doesn‚Äôt automatically pay for all services, most significantly, prescription drugs, including drugs needed to fight cancer.
Here's what Sen @BernieSanders said about health care in Canada, which has a single-payer system: "In Canada, for a number of decades, they have provided quality care to all people without out-of-pocket expenses. You go in for cancer therapy, you don't take out your wallet." https://t.co/FaKo2GdWwF

Some experts and lawmakers also have raised concerns about the kind of precedent this national emergency declaration might set. More details: https://t.co/XeKuU68UOJ
Trump has said he would declare a national emergency if he can't get Congress to agree with him; experts say that would amount to using emergency powers to do an end-run around the legislative process.
The longest-running national emergency declaration is from 1979, first issued by Democratic President Jimmy Carter in the wake of the Iran hostage crisis.
Events leading to national emergency declarations include the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
National emergency declarations often deal with situations related to foreign governments and foreign entities and rely on powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.
There have been around 60 national emergency declarations since November 1979.
National emergency declarations are used relatively frequently. A president can issue his or her own national emergency declaration and renew declarations from past presidents that have not expired.
Congress has delegated broad powers, allowing a president to repurpose funds after declaring a national emergency. But there are still laws to follow.
A national emergency declaration needs to be renewed every year, or it will automatically expire.
The law requires a president to specify the statutory authorities he or she is invoking to address the national emergency
Does a president have legal authority to declare a national emergency? Yes. A relevant law is the National Emergencies Act of 1976.

‚ùóÔ∏èOn Feb. 7, conservative activist Jacob Wohl tweeted the 1979 photo of the UNC students in the white robes and blackface. He didn‚Äôt include a link to his source, nor did he respond to a question from PolitiFact.	There's no reason to think this is Cooper:	https://t.co/jpn2xnIAnE
It takes several paragraphs for the @DailyMailUK story to clarify the facts. The fourth paragraph says: "There is no suggestion that Cooper is in any of those photos."
Although the headline doesn‚Äôt specifically say the governor was in the controversial photos, readers could interpret it to mean he was. A subheadline says, "Cooper was in the different Chi Psi fraternity did not feature on their pages," but that subheadline is in smaller font.
‚ùóÔ∏èLater on Feb. 6, the UK-based https://t.co/1utaWT40oP posted a story about the photos. But their headline said, "Blackface lynch pics from Roy Cooper North Carolina yearbook."
Cooper was in a different fraternity ‚Äì albeit one with a similar-sounding name ‚Äì called Chi Psi.
One of the photos shows two white students dressed in white hooded robes like those worn by the Ku Klux Klan. The students, members of the Chi Phi Fraternity, are holding onto a noose that was around the neck of another white student, who was covered in blackface makeup.
Here's what happened: 		‚ùóÔ∏èAbout 1:45 p.m. on Feb. 6, Colin Campbell, editor of the NC Insider, part of The News &amp; Observer, tweeted photos from the 1979 UNC-Chapel Hill yearbook. (@PolitiFactNC is a partnership of PolitiFact and @newsobserver ) https://t.co/IHCIFQoAMK

We highlighted this check of @KamalaHarris to help viewers in real time, but we are now looking into Stacey Abrams' specific statement, which talked about cost of living and not inflation. The terms are related but not identical. We hope to have an update to share soon.
@misskorilyn That's right. We rely on our database of fact-checks to help viewers of these speeches in real time. We are working on a more specific analysis of Stacey Abrams' claim and will have more on our website soon.
Our team is continuing to fact-check both addresses by @realDonaldTrump and @staceyabrams. The place to see our updates is üëá#SOTU 	https://t.co/Fei9ekaaht https://t.co/z7aJ4y8IF6
Stacey Abrams said that "wages are struggling to keep pace with the actual cost of living." But wages are keeping up with inflation. https://t.co/gvUyLCZnkq
Thanks for following along, and for your support. https://t.co/vamfA1xnbi
We'll update that story with more fact-checks from Trump. We'll also be fact-checking @staceyabrams, who is coming up with the Democratic response.
You can see our first take on President Donald Trump's #SOTU2019 with full fact-checks here. https://t.co/Fei9ekaaht
Donald Trump says, "We have spent more than $7 trillion in fighting wars in the Middle East." That's Half True. https://t.co/7v7qiJtMKe
Donald Trump says, "For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by friends of ours, members of NATO -- but now we have secured over the last couple of years $100 billion in increase." Trump is right, and it's a Promise Kept. https://t.co/NopktZf3ap
Donald Trump says, "Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs." That's basically correct, and a talking point shared by @BernieSanders https://t.co/mrvoqTzKYv
Donald Trump says, "In the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens." Trump inflates the numbers by counting both charges and convictions, as he did during his recent immigration address.. https://t.co/J3gbERPBH2
Donald Trump says, "One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north." That's Half True. https://t.co/NuB7TWJbob
Donald Trump says, "Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders..." That's False, as we have analyzed several times. https://t.co/oloyREGIPL https://t.co/sxIxl1sGXn
Donald Trump says "the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world." It's actually been that way for years, as we've said. https://t.co/B0Sf4BmdvX
Donald Trump says he "virtually ended" the estate tax. That's misleading. https://t.co/UDhZB56BkP
@realDonaldTrump: "African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded." 		Trump's numbers check out. https://t.co/hpk1QT0O5h
Today, especially in this era of misinformation and attacks on press freedoms, we‚Äôre also asking you to stand up for truth and support PolitiFact. We're a small nonprofit newsroom, so every dollar matters. https://t.co/vamfA1OY2Q https://t.co/XhGoGyx01u
In fact, @BarackObama made a similar claim during his 2015 #SOTU, saying "America is No. 1 in oil and gas." https://t.co/nnXSKnXz7w
That claim is right on the stats, but the use of the word "now" would be misleading. As we noted in a 2015 fact-check, the United States has been the world‚Äôs largest oil producer since 2012, and the largest natural gas producer for years.		https://t.co/B0Sf4BDOnv
So we can show you how this works. @realDonaldTrump, according to excerpts released by the White House, is prepared to say: "We have unleashed a revolution in American Energy ‚Äì the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world."
We'll do the same for @staceyabrams Democratic response following the @realDonaldTrump's remarks. We have 10 fact-checkers working tonight split and you can suggest fact-checks for them using #politifactthis
When there's a "match," we'll post that information on our Twitter feed and at this link. https://t.co/Fei9ekrL91
Tonight, during the #SOTU2019 , we'll rely on our previous work, as well as our fact-checks of the Trump administration to present information in near real-time. We'll check the claims as they are delivered by the president, and compare them up to our database of checks.

@KenPaxtonTX Candidate for California Governor Antonio Villaraigosa said "Undocumented immigrants commit less crimes than the native born." @CAPolitiFact rated this Mostly True: https://t.co/i7I8e1JjtT
In Sept, Republican @kenpaxtontx, invoked previously debunked numbers when asked about Democrats seeking to decriminalize border crossings. He said Texas has "had over 600,000 crimes committed by illegals since 2011. Over 1,200 homicides." Pants on Fire: https://t.co/aRH5QG0DhH
Here are more of our fact-checks related to criminal activity by undocumented immigrants in the U.S.:
It's worth noting that the majority of the ICE arrests take place away from the border, and the high number of people arrested who have criminal records has a lot to do with where ICE encounters most immigrants.
@realDonaldTrump Plus, Trump spoke of both charges and convictions. By folding them together, the numbers look bigger, but a charge doesn‚Äôt mean that a person is guilty. Plus, ICE also notes that past convictions get included in each year‚Äôs tally.
@realDonaldTrump The Pew Research Center made the same point: "The total number of charges and convictions is greater than the total number of arrestees," the center noted in a February 2018 report.
@realDonaldTrump It's true, during the last two years, ICE officials arrested 266,000 people. But, ICE reports note that each arrest "may represent multiple criminal charges and convictions." A single person could have committed multiple crimes.
During last night's address, @realDonaldTrump said: "In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings." These numbers need context:

Of course, we will be watching and fact-checking tonight‚Äôs address and the Democratic response. You can follow our work here on Twitter, and we‚Äôll have a story on https://t.co/6iAcZZN0ud.
That could be tricky for news organizations that don‚Äôt have a catalog of fact-checks to draw from or a consistent research and judging standard.
PolitiFact draws upon our archive of fact-checks, which has been researched and vetted, to make live fact-check decisions. Like we will tonight.
For instance, we have fact-checked @realDonaldTrump more than 600 times and we fact-checked more than 1,500 individual statements in 2018.
Live fact-checking isn‚Äôt as easy as a Google search, and it doesn‚Äôt catch every misstatement. At PolitiFact, we only present live or real-time fact-checks of repeated or similar claims we‚Äôve checked previously.
We believe this type of real-time fact-checking can work best with established fact-checking organizations who fact-check politicians and candidates daily.
We are ready to try live fact-checking again with @ABCPolitics @CBSNews @NBCPolitics @CNNPolitics @foxnewspolitics should they be interested.
We presented a live fact-checking idea to at least one television network to see if they‚Äôd use a similar system on air. They were interested but ultimately nothing came of it.
Because we were fact-checking live from the debate site, and because the video was a bit delayed, our fact-checks appeared within seconds of @realDonaldTrump or @HillaryClinton making their claim. We published 16 fact-checks during the St. Louis debate, for instance.
So with Factstream, you could watch a livestream of the debate on your computer and get pop-up notifications every time we created a new fact-check. Here‚Äôs an image of how it worked. https://t.co/fLy8ISSi3r
At PolitiFact, we worked with @ReportersLab in 2016 to develop a live fact-checking tool called FactStream. We deployed this during the 2016 presidential debates to produce fact-checks, in real-time, for people watching the debates via computer.
There has been a lot of discussion about the role of ‚Äúlive‚Äù fact-checking on television ahead of @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs immigration address tonight. We have some thoughts.

There is also a legal difference. In 2013, Obamacare was already law. Funding for the border wall is not. 		Sign up for the PolitiFact Daily email (PolitiFact's best fact-checking straight to your inboxes every morning M-F): https://t.co/cmNr1Uf1zA
Second, in 2013, two issues, Obamacare and the debt ceiling, were on the table. In 2018, funding for the wall stands alone. In 2013, a compromise on the debt ceiling cleared the way to reopen the government.
Leading Republicans, including Paul Ryan, noted that in 2013, Obamacare largely would move forward even if some elements were defunded. In that sense, Obama was not fighting to "force" Obamacare, because he didn‚Äôt need to.
We thought we‚Äôd compare the two fiscal impasses. üîë There are a couple of key differences between then and today:
A post from Trump-backer Kristy Greczkowski said, "Oct 2013, Obama shut down the government for 16 days to force Obamacare. A friendly reminder America. Secure our borders."
Today in PolitiFact Daily: With no end to the federal government shutdown in sight, a Facebook post shared over 71,000 times reminded people of the 2013 shutdown under President Barack Obama. https://t.co/7YJZD20aLD https://t.co/0OOZ5Bz0zf

A majority of states now permit legal use in some form, and several states are poised to relax their laws this November. https://t.co/xmpJN2lPFa
About two in three Americans now favor marijuana legalization, a record-high measure of public support for a drug the federal government still puts in the same category as LSD and heroin.
New numbers show the deficit is on the rise. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported that the preliminary federal budget deficit was $782 billion in fiscal year 2018 ‚Äî $116 billion more than the shortfall in fiscal year 2017. What happened? https://t.co/bQDbpr0mSt
This year, the big shift is on the Republican side. They‚Äôve largely gone silent. https://t.co/AKnYu0x2YY
Until recently, Republicans and Democrats debated the future of Medicare in fairly predictable ways. Republicans would offer plans to trim or cap benefits over time, and Democrats would skewer them for putting the squeeze on vulnerable Americans in their retirement years.
The large tax bill passed by the Republican Congress and signed by President Donald Trump is not getting mentioned much on the midterm campaign trail, perhaps because the public seems to be lukewarm on whether it was a good idea. ://bit.ly/2yyFIWt

For his part, President Donald Trump fires up the Republican base with the inaccurate allegation that Democrats "want to raid Medicare to pay for their socialist agenda." In the fray, hard numbers are easily lost.
Health care (and what the U.S. government does about it) is just about all anyone can talk about leading up to #midterms2018. We've got the facts: https://t.co/RSbcIIdUqY   In state after state, Democrats are using health care like a cudgel against Republicans.

Check out the biggest falsehoods from the final push of rallies¬†here: https://t.co/nXD9igBwWM and our best Senate fact-checks ahead of #Election Day here: https://t.co/ZxMxE4Z0mb https://t.co/zMdPOspg07
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity @realDonaldObama @DickBlumenthal @HawleyMO @clairecmc @ICEgov "We gave our warriors the largest pay raise in more than a decade."	Not quite. They got a 2.6 percent pay raise¬†this year. In 2010, Congress upped military pay by 3.4 percent. In 2009, it was even higher, 3.9 percent, and the year before that, 3.5 percent.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity @realDonaldObama @DickBlumenthal @HawleyMO @clairecmc @ICEgov "We passed Veterans Choice," @realDonaldTrump said. Actually, it's 4 years old https://t.co/YeZJrTowzp
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity @realDonaldObama @DickBlumenthal @HawleyMO @clairecmc @ICEgov "American steel and aluminum mills are roaring back to life," Trump said. While experts have mixed impressions about the long-term job growth from Trump‚Äôs steel tariffs, we found evidence of a handful of steel companies investing in the industry. https://t.co/yNkI8nD0OK https://t.co/WzPFcdmzE7
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity @realDonaldObama @DickBlumenthal @HawleyMO @clairecmc @ICEgov .@realDonaldTrump also said Democrats want to destroy @ICEgov. A few Democrats seem to want the agency shuttered, but most -- including congressional leaders -- talk of restructuring or a new focus.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity @realDonaldObama @DickBlumenthal @HawleyMO @clairecmc Trump said @ICEgov arrested 127,000 illegal immigrants with criminal convictions or facing charges of breaking our nation's‚Äô laws. That's True. https://t.co/UAwNoJPomN https://t.co/8EtxdIJOb9
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity @realDonaldObama @DickBlumenthal @HawleyMO @clairecmc No, Democrats are not "raiding Medicare to fund benefits for illegal immigrants," as Trump said. Democrats aren‚Äôt saying they want to sign up caravan members for perks upon arrival, much less the right to vote without being U.S. citizens. https://t.co/nXD9igBwWM
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity @realDonaldObama @DickBlumenthal @HawleyMO @clairecmc "The Democrat plan would obliterate Medicare," @realDonaldTrump said. That's False. Medicare for All would expand Medicare, not obliterate it. And not all Democrats support it. https://t.co/2mH6H2otUP https://t.co/NPyOkkoXrV
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity @realDonaldObama @DickBlumenthal .@HawleyMO said @clairecmc is sponsoring an "open borders bill," repeating a @realDonaldTrump talking point. There is no such bill. The bill introduced by Feinstein, and supported by all Senate Democrats, is meant to stop family separations at the border https://t.co/3l5EYZ4gtv https://t.co/VbQMXUSzXU

@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews "We have the worst (immigration) laws you've every seen," @realDonaldTrump told @FoxNews. Trump underplays the increasing robustness of U.S. immigration laws and enforcement even under his predecessors. https://t.co/vQOUaQFRQ3 https://t.co/8oJtKW5Eyq
@realDonaldTrump "It was very bad when I took it over," @realDonaldTrump told @FoxNews of the economy in a pre-rally interview. But the¬†economy grew every quarter¬†from the second quarter of 2014 through 2016 and added¬†over 11 million jobs¬†during Obama‚Äôs second term. https://t.co/2fIKK35Ka2

@realDonaldTrump @DickBlumenthal @braun4indiana @JoeforIndiana @TheLawmakers Did @realDonaldTrump give the military the "greatest pay raise in more than 10 years"? The increase of 2.4 percent in 2018 represented the biggest bump since 2010. https://t.co/Q1sjy1eFE2 https://t.co/X1dEa2OsvX
@realDonaldTrump @DickBlumenthal @braun4indiana @JoeforIndiana @TheLawmakers "We just passed Choice," @realDonaldTrump said. Trump is wrong that Veterans Choice wasn‚Äôt passed until he came into office. Congress passed a new version of a Choice program in¬†June 2018¬†‚Äî but the program itself has been around since 2014. https://t.co/YeZJrTowzp https://t.co/iF6M5rsM2a
@realDonaldTrump @DickBlumenthal @braun4indiana @JoeforIndiana @TheLawmakers "Thanks to our tariffs and trade policies, our steel mills are roaring back to life," Trump said. While¬†experts have mixed impressions about the long-term job growth from Trump‚Äôs steel tariffs, several steel mills are reopening or expanding. https://t.co/yNkI8nD0OK https://t.co/qy3ZAmr5xT
@realDonaldTrump @DickBlumenthal @braun4indiana @JoeforIndiana @TheLawmakers There's no evidence to back up the idea that Democratic plans would fund benefits for undocumented immigrants. And people over 65¬†who snuck across the border don‚Äôt qualify for Medicare. https://t.co/nXD9igBwWM
@realDonaldTrump @DickBlumenthal @braun4indiana @JoeforIndiana @TheLawmakers Trump said the Democrat plan would obliterate Medicare. That's False. The current Medicare program, including the subsidized private insurance option called Medicare Advantage, would be replaced with a more generous program. https://t.co/2mH6H2otUP https://t.co/qCAkFMdaHJ
@realDonaldTrump @DickBlumenthal @braun4indiana @JoeforIndiana .@realDonaldTrump said @joeforindiana was rated the least effective senator. @TheLawmakers assigns credit based on bill sponsorship. Instead, Donnelly co-sponsored bills, wrote amendments and crafted language that made its way into 43 laws https://t.co/MQpwsB5VDB
@realDonaldTrump @DickBlumenthal @braun4indiana @JoeforIndiana "@JoeforIndiana also supports open borders," Trump said of the Democratic incumbent in the #INSen race. That's False. Donnelly has mostly stood with Republicans when it comes to immigration. He voted in favor of Trump's border wall three times. https://t.co/Exw8sSLOB8
@realDonaldTrump @DickBlumenthal Trump is stumping for @braun4indiana, @JoeforIndiana's challenger for the U.S. Senate seat in Indiana. Here are all the claims we've checked from the #INSen race. https://t.co/E0ydCUo8Ur https://t.co/hGCIAF81zJ
@realDonaldTrump @DickBlumenthal Trump said he passed the biggest tax cuts in history. That's False. Depending on what projection of the current bill you use and what yardstick you measure it by, several bills since 1980 were larger. https://t.co/c3WKQ3wohp https://t.co/idMlPHfM8D
@realDonaldTrump Trump says Sen. @DickBlumenthal "lied about his service" in Vietnam. On at least three occasions, Blumenthal did say things that placed him in Vietnam. But at other times, his words reflected his actual resume. https://t.co/MWdgNmVWTs https://t.co/eNlDh03pXl

Trump said many members of the caravan coming to the U.S. border from Central America are criminals and gang members. 		It‚Äôs hard to say. Eyewitness news reports show mainly children, women and men trekking north.

"Asian unemployment rate has recently reached the lowest level, again likewise, in history."	This statistic has only been calculated since 2003, so "in history" should be taken with a grain of salt. That said, the rate has been low, hovering around 3.0 in the first half of 2018.
Hispanic - Trump is on safe ground here. The current 4.6 percent Hispanic unemployment rate is a record low.
African-American - This was correct for May 2018, when it was 5.9 percent, but the rate ticked up again in June, to 6.5 percent. That‚Äôs still low by historical standards, however.	https://t.co/X7gj9yZULB

Ultimately, most experts bemoaned the dearth of research on marijuana legalization‚Äôs effects. ‚ÄúIt might represent a ‚Äòreal-time‚Äô experiment,‚Äù said @danielmedwed, ‚Äúwith consumers effectively serving as guinea pigs, especially with respect to long-term impacts.‚Äù https://t.co/0bCLSdWzne
Some experts said the pros of legalization far outweighed the cons, while others said it‚Äôs too soon to tell. Among the chief concerns were studies suggesting that marijuana legalization is linked to an increase in traffic accidents https://t.co/8T9pJksVe9
The war on drugs has had a disproportionate impact on minorities, which is helping to drive legalization. The @ACLU found that whites and blacks used marijuana at nearly the same rates, but blacks were nearly four times more likely to be arrested for pot https://t.co/B28sEDOIN7
States that haven‚Äôt legalized pot are leaving money on the table, according to analysts. A @taxfoundation study showed that if all states adopted a legalize-and-tax approach, they‚Äôd potentially reap about $7 billion a year. https://t.co/JbsVkJGxuT

The sweeping shift in America‚Äôs view of pot legalization has been dramatic. Historians say California‚Äôs 1996 vote to legalize medical marijuana was a major catalyst. "It removed the most formidable barrier: wholesale illegality," said @danielmedwed https://t.co/0rxC3kAGgC
About two in three Americans now favor marijuana legalization. That‚Äôs a record-high measure of public support for a drug the federal government still puts in the same category as LSD and heroin. https://t.co/5kP0zwIGOL

Check out our midterm report for more details on marijuana legalization https://t.co/aVU01fTfay
Some experts said the pros of legalization far outweighed the cons, while others said it‚Äôs too early to tell. One concern about the rapid pace of legalization is the lack of research on marijuana‚Äôs effects. https://t.co/aVU01fTfay https://t.co/dXJvRAv7RL
A comprehensive 2013 analysis by the @ACLU found that while whites and blacks used marijuana at nearly the same rates, blacks were nearly 4 times more likely to be arrested for pot than whites https://t.co/aVU01fTfay https://t.co/MaTgB9Tigg
Taxes on marijuana can work a bit like a double-edged sword: If they‚Äôre set too low, a state leaves money on the table; too high, and the black market may present the more attractive option. https://t.co/aVU01fTfay https://t.co/wa4VeRwXxQ
31 states and D.C. have okayed medical use, and 16 more have approved limited medical use https://t.co/aVU01fTfay https://t.co/CTZhbEsNUv
9 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana https://t.co/aVU01fTfay https://t.co/a3IE6wZuxY
Marijuana is illegal under federal law. The federal government‚Äôs official position is that marijuana has "a high potential for abuse" and "no currently accepted medical use." https://t.co/aVU01fTfay
We are also told that growing concerns about the opioid epidemic may have improved marijuana‚Äôs image, with marijuana often seen as a more benign, less addictive pain relief alternative to opioids https://t.co/aVU01fTfay https://t.co/v2tjSU91LL
Experts say the marijuana legalization strategy found more success by shifting its focus to states rather than Congress https://t.co/aVU01fTfay https://t.co/MT3rc7CX9m

Throughout the evening, we investigated their stand-out claims, which we've compiled in a post-debate round-up: https://t.co/fETDs9ZA3r #MOSenateDebate https://t.co/nTzWvyCVlH
.@clairecmc said that @HawleyMO search warrants into human trafficking at Springfield's massage businesses turned up 0 felony charges. She's right.
.@HawleyMO claimed that @clairecmc has voted against including mental health records in national background checks. But that statement doesn't tell the full story of all her votes, 4 more of which supported mental health provisions.
.@clairecmc pointed out that @HawleyMO said four-year college degrees are ‚Äúworthless.‚Äù He denied it during the debate, but has used that word many times, talking about the ‚Äúincreasingly worthless‚Äù nature of four-year degrees. https://t.co/fETDs9ZA3r https://t.co/3DMEtWk3rg
.@HawleyMO said @clairecmc referred to the middle-class tax cuts as scraps. She did, saying working-class Missourians deserve more.
.@HawleyMO said @clairecmc "voted to raises taxes or fees 200 times in her 12-year career." That number is wrong, and includes double votes and votes against tax cuts. https://t.co/fETDs9ZA3r
.@clairecmc said that The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act "hasn't paid for itself." She isn't completely wrong. Since its passing, money spent has increased, but tax revenue actually decreased.
Did Republicans really make tax cuts permanent for the rich and temporary for the middle class like @clairecmc said? Somewhat. Most tax cuts will phase out by 2025, but the rich have been granted critical exceptions.‚Äù

Mexico‚Äôs government on Oct. 18 said it was requesting support from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to help process refugee applications.
Guatemalan president Jimmy Morales said "close to 100 people" linked to ISIS had been detained and deported back to their home countries.
Trump has not provided supporting evidence to his ‚Äúunknown Middle Easterners.‚Äù ABC News, which has a crew traveling with the caravan, said they had not seen evidence to support Trump‚Äôs claim.
It‚Äôs unclear who has organized this caravan. The caravan in April was organized by Pueblo Sin Fronteras, an organization that provides humanitarian aid and legal advice to migrants and refugees.
Most people in the caravan are thought to be from Honduras.		Some news reports initially said the caravan consisted of about 3,000 men, women and children. But more people joined the caravan in recent days, with new reports pegging the number from 5,000 to more than 7,000.
You may be reading a lot about this particular group of migrants heading to the border; about their motivations and background. Here are the facts:
and Trump asked Mexico "to stop this onslaught" and warned that if it didn‚Äôt, he would call on the U.S. military to "close" the southern border.
He claimed there were "many criminals" among the men, women and children; threatened to stop "all payments" to the countries; https://t.co/n9AftJ8WAl
In a series of tweets Oct 18, President Donald Trump berated leadership in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala for not doing enough to stop the caravan-
