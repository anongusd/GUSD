Roger Stone says he also remains a great supporter of President Trump. Q. Would he get a pardon? A: "The only person I have advocated a pardon for is Marcus Garvey."
Stone says he looks forward to being fully and completely vindicated.
Ok, one for one on that: "As I have always said, the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about." - Roger Stone https://t.co/S0UU3LbXhX
One can only imagine Roger Stone's immense chagrin at being absolutely mobbed by reporters and cameras as he prepares to speak...
There are more, but this one comes to mind: I asked Roger Stone for a column I wrote back in (wow) 2011 if he had any advice for the then-embattled Anthony Weiner. His rule: "Admit nothing, deny everything and launch counterattacks." Well, we shall see... https://t.co/mL4ToePkfF
And if you think the Roger Stone - Randy Credico thing is new, trust me, it's not. I wrote about them getting into it way back during the 2013 election cycle, for example: https://t.co/aMaYz4kNl5
"A federal prosecutor can indict a ham sandwich. They can make anything look as they wish. That doesn't mean it's accurate," Roger Stone once told me... https://t.co/rp7pt5G2MO
And in this piece, Roger Stone directly contradicted the president about when they'd last been in touch: https://t.co/eoUDkj2uPz

More (via pool) from the prepared remarks of FLOTUS on the opioid crisis, including ending any stigma associated with seeking help for addiction: https://t.co/9YcphAgjfx
In re the opioid epidemic and talking to/educating Barron as a mother about the dangers of drugs and addiction, FLOTUS says, "I discuss with him, I teach him what is right, what is wrong... To love yourself more than you love drugs."
FLOTUS says son Barron isn't into social media -- he's into sports. "He's a great athlete... I teach him to be responsible and treat people with respect and kindness."
Asked about the hubbub over the red Xmas trees at the White House, FLOTUS responds: "We are in [the] 21st Century, and everyone has a different taste. I think they look fantastic... You are all welcome to visit the White House -- the people's house."
FLOTUS re about how she's treated by the media: "I would like that they focus more on what we are doing... They would like to portray different stories and focus on different [unimportant] stuff, really, and I'm here to shine the light [on] important stuff." https://t.co/u0ZCwxlFB9

"We are Georgia. So let's get it done!" Democrat Stacey Abrams wraps up her address to supporters, never mentioning by name -- nor conceding to -- GOP rival Brian Kemp in the race for governor.
"Georgia -- friends. We are still on the verge of history -- and the best is yet to come... Because this is not about me. This is about us." - Stacey Abrams
Abrams says what's on the ballot is a choice between 'division and trickery' and the right of people to vote.
Georgia, you put your faith in me, but I want you to know tonight: The feeling is mutual. - Stacey Abrams
I'm not going to name names, but some have tried hard to take our voices away. To scare us away. But our vision is clear and we see the finish line, Abrams says.
"Democracy only works when we work for it. When we fight for it. When we demand it," Abrams says. "I'm here to tell you tonight votes remain to be counted" and voices remain to be heard. "I promise you tonight that we're going to make sure that EVERY vote [is] counted."
"When chose me as your Democratic nominee, I made you a vow," @staceyabrams tells supporters - that no one would be left unseen or unheard... "Tonight we have closed the gap between yesterday and tomorrow. But we still have a few more miles to go."

ICYMI, I though this section of the president's remarks from tonight's Kavanaugh ceremony was worth sharing verbatim. Via WH transcript: https://t.co/kxg4lBspmV
@Reuters @darth
can confirm https://t.co/mvPuw9ubGs
Kavanaugh says the confirmation process "tested" him, but did not change him... "I am an optimist. I live on the sunrise side of the mountain." https://t.co/EqXdSBFO5V
Kavanaugh thanks his daughters' teachers for giving them the day off from school tomorrow so they can watch proceedings in two #SCOTUS cases. He also thanks his wife for her support.
"I love all my friends," Justice Kavanaugh says.
Kavanaugh notes that all of his clerks are women, "a first in the history of the Supreme Court." He also thanks his "amazing and fearless" friends going from back in high school to the White House, and thanks all who have sent him and his wife prayers.
"I will always be a team player on the team of nine," Kavanaugh promises from the podium. https://t.co/6OdkVajof0
Justice Kennedy administers the oath to Justice Kavanaugh: https://t.co/5uCVlk8MiZ
Now, "It is up to us to renew the bonds of love, loyalty, and affection that link us all together as one great American family," Trump says.
The president's apology aside, the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings were *not* a criminal trial, so I don't believe anyone was proven "innocent" (or guilty) of anything through them, nor through the FBI background check. https://t.co/CeQBrKx5k1
Trump also addresses himself specifically to Kavanaugh's two daughters, praising their dad. Kind words also for... Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- "I think that's the biggest hand he's ever received" -- &amp; Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley.
President Trump begins the ceremony by apologizing to Kavanaugh and his family for how they were treated during the confirmation process, telling the judge: "You, sir, under historic scrutiny, were proven innocent. Thank you."
A big moment for POTUS: Shaking the hand of the newest Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh, as retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy stands by in the East Room of the White House. Read more about the fight to get to this moment (via @glamourmag) https://t.co/wRQEyvsJj9 https://t.co/qrzBfvU0ce

And there it is, from Sen. Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, on #SCOTUS nominee Brett Kavanaugh: "I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh." https://t.co/MIGnRq8QVP
Collins chastising the "leaker," whom she says she hopes is listening now and whose actions led to the public I.D. of Christine Blasey Ford. (Also: Collins doesn't think Sen. Dianne Feinstein would have done such a damaging thing, she says.) https://t.co/stoWtmCjYX
More: Collins said it appears Ford was not 'aware' of the option to testify privately in California, and (paraphrase) that some people who wanted the Kavanaugh nomination to fail didn't care about Ford's well-being as a result of testifying publicly in DC. https://t.co/tM9aACC9fI
Collins says she does NOT believe the allegations can fairly prevent Kavanaugh from serving on the high court. Emphasizes that assault and #MeToo are real; says she has listened to many stories from survivors and is 'grateful for their courage' https://t.co/lSD3sqEqI0
Collins is raising questions about Ford's testimony and the lack of corroboration of some of her allegations -- even from people who were close friends of Ford's at the time... notes 'this is not a criminal trial...'
Talking about presumption of innocence, Collins says she is referring NOT to allegations put forward by Christine Blasey Ford, but rather other separate "outlandish" claims related to allegations of young women being drugged and assaulted ... https://t.co/aDhQkU1top
Maine's Collins citing some positive reviews she has heard/see not only of Kavanaugh's work as a judge, but his character and conduct. Example: https://t.co/FaNNgJh47Q
Collins said Kavanaugh 'unequivocally' assured her he would not rule in accordance with any pre-established deal with anyone, including influential conservative groups
Continuing on Roe v. Wade, Collins cites Kavanaugh remarks on overturning longstanding precedent (or not) if a majority of currently justices think it's wrong... https://t.co/0uNiDWvylf
Moving right along, Sen. Susan Collins defending Kavanaugh record on laws regarding same-sex marriage and LGBTQ rights... cites @JimObergefell, Masterpiece Cakeshop, more. Seems not to have changed believe he considers Roe v. Wade a matter of 'settled law.'
Continuing point-by-point rebuttal to critics' main objections to Kavanaugh, Collins has gotten up to the debate over the judge's views on executive power https://t.co/YIfdofbb8n
Collins now seems to be suggesting Kavanaugh is not the existential threat to the ACA some think he is / would be on the Supreme Court ...
More from Sen. Susan Collins, Republican of Maine: https://t.co/VkT0CnqgoD
Collins: "one can only hope that the kavanaugh nomination is where the process has finally hit rock bottom"

Kris Kobach interview request sent for 10/03/2018.
Going back to SHS responses on Ford testimony, she is largely advancing the general argument used in support of Kavanaugh, which is that his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee has been heavily scrutinized, but giving Ford's equal scrutiny is apparently unacceptable...
SHS also refers to NYT investigation of past business/tax practices of POTUS as 'boring' and says she is not aware of any plans for him to release his (long-awaited) tax returns. (I would add here: being under IRS audit does *not* legally preclude release of those/any returns.)

And now, a little break in the Kavanaugh #SCOTUS confirmation hearings. Notice anything about this photo? https://t.co/oGf5lxznZY
Sen. Cruz specifically suggested the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee want to use this #SCOTUS hearing to relitigate the 2016 election... and then spent more than a couple of seconds discussing Hillary Clinton.
Sen. Cruz may sure not be wrong that some of this Kavanaugh hearing is Democratic political positioning; not sure it's entirely fair for him to say the judge's record itself hasn't been raised considering (for one), the exhaustive review just given by @SenWhitehouse. #SCOTUS
‚ÄúIf you trust the American people, they will trust you,‚Äù Durbin tells Kavanaugh, urging him to ‚Äústep up‚Äù and request a suspension until all docs are reviewed. (Image via ‚Å¶@USATODAY‚Å© on ‚Å¶@PeriscopeTV‚Å©) #SCOTUS https://t.co/36zVr0gh7x

.@SenFeinstein goes on to tell Kavanaugh that on guns, his reasoning is way outside 'the mainstream' ...
Anyone who noted earlier that Sen. Dianne Feinstein was being awful quiet during the Kavanaugh Supreme Court hearings can definitely back off that now: "You are willing to disregard precedent" is about the nicest thing she's said to him so far in her opening statement. https://t.co/DyFO0o8ycP

@Sluggo115 In sum: Voting in the US -- unlike other countries -- is both a right and a choice. It is perfectly sensible and correct for states to want to keep voter rolls updated and accurate; the instant question is whether the Ohio plan accomplishes this fairly.
@Sluggo115 U.S. citizens, properly registered, have the right to vote - or to refuse to vote for any reason or no reason. Not voting may be in itself a political statement. Only a few things can cost you this right, such as conviction for certain crimes...
@Sluggo115 The law specifically prohibits applying the 'use it or lose it' standard to U.S. voting. Participation in elections is not compulsory. The majority ruling acknowledges this; the difference is they say it's not totally use/lose bc people ALSO have to fail to return a postcard.
