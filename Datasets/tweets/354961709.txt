Just a note: Children in the death report are not identified and are not being identified in this hearing. However we've done an extensive investigation of this case. The parents in Tobi's death are also charged.
The social worker who described the the mother of baby Tobi as being compliant despite evidence to the contrary is still employed at DCYF

But unlike the gov's budget amendment last year, existing dispensaries would *not* be able to get a second location. But existing cultivators could apply for a dispensary license. Got it? #intheweeds
No timeline released for application process for new dispensaries. More info would come later from regulations.
Budget also calls for reducing patient plant count from 12 to 8. But patient possession limits would go from 2.5 ounces to 3 ounces.
"Acute pain" would mean things like a broken bone, dental work, surgery could get someone a temporarily medical marijuana card for up to 6 months.
Big changes proposed in the gov's budget for the medical marijuana program. Among them: Add 12 more dispensaries, allow patients from CT and MA to purchase in RI, add acute pain to the list of qualifying conditions.

Takeaway: No one knows how to solve the pension problem.
Q: Should pensions be reduced or paid in full?
Chaika picks Elorza.
LaFortune didn‚Äôt pick. Said all had their strengths.
Santow says Elorza is the best this century because of what he‚Äôs put into public schools.
Lallier says Cianci did the best job of the four mayors this century. Says it‚Äôs what he did for the city and the people of Providence.
Ha! Tough question from @TedNesi. Who was best mayor of Cianci, Cicilline, Taveras, Elorza?
Q: What‚Äôs the top issue in Ward 3? Chaika: Taxes; LaFortune: Division in community; Lallier: Education; Santow: Unequal opportunity

Santow says he never thought about running for council until Trump was elected.

RI Center for Freedom and Prosperity not surprisingly isn't fond of gov's budget https://t.co/yyQorVXLzT
RIers should pay use tax on out-of-state purchases, which would capture the online sales tax gov wants. But how many ppl currently pay up?
@MSten37 Yes. There's an increase in there, but can't recall right now how much it is.
What you need to know about Raimondo's $9.25 billion budget. Our first take: https://t.co/AFn2PMUYQU
Other budget adds: Another $10 m for the 195 development fund that's now down to approx $5m. Sec. Pryor says other companies are interested
Raimondo also wants a 50-cent hike in cigarette tax to $4.25 a pack -- would be second highest cig tax in the country
That includes a 1-percent cut to hospital reimbursement rates on Jan. 1, 2018
Medicaid savings of $39 million is the other big way the budget will pay for state programs.
Raimondo's budget provides no contingency planning for federal funding that might be cut in a Trump administration
State plans to compel retailers to start collecting tax. If they don't, they'll have to notify customers with pop-ups that they owe tax
Specifically, the state is banking on $35 million in new sales tax revenue from online sales.
Raimondo has released a $9.25-billion spending plan that relies heavily on being able to collect sales tax from online retailers

Edibles -- one of Gov Raimondo's big concerns -- would not come on board immediately. DBR would have authority to draft regs at a later time
All pot plants would have to be tagged using the same system the state just instated for medical marijuana plants.

@BrianCNewberry Rampant confusion and it never saw more than six "no" votes in the House.
The bill that was vetoed would have said for your license to be valid here, you first have to go to the DMV with a letter from your embassy
Issue is this: Right now if you travel to most other countries, you can drive there with a US license and vice versa.
The bill the gov vetoed is much more nuanced. It has to do with licenses for people who are here on student or work visas (i.e. legally).
Drivers' licenses for undocumented immigrants did not clear the GA.
That's understandable. Media has covered the push for drivers' licenses for undocumented, but the bill the gov vetoed is not that bill.
Judging by the comments on the gov's veto of the driver's license bill, I think some folks might be confused about what the bill did.
Ultimately, it would have also made it easier for foreigners on visas and green cards to get a RI license w/o taking a drivers test
Bill is a bit of a mixed bag. It would have added new requirements for foreigners to have their licenses recognized here. (Gov's issue)
This veto is challenging to the 140 character limit.
Gov takes issue with added requirements for licenses that appear to be in conflict with the Geneva Convention
Gov says she likes the intent of the bill, which would have paved an easier path to RI drivers licenses

The Senate has stopped twice to give TPW time to collect herself. Still unclear what's happened.
What's going on in the Senate? Looks like Paiva Weed was struggling, maybe tearing up.
Raptakis: I think children are more important than animals. (Arguing over # of animal bills but no action on children left in cars.)
