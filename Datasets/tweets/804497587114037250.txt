@Teri_A_Adams I greatly support all of these ideas to minimize abortion and hope all could agree less abortion is better.  But blindly ignoring nuance, claiming embryo dependent on mother same as living child, and effectively placing embryo life as more important than mother is not helpful.
@Teri_A_Adams Sex education on preventing pregnancy generally is another factor.  Increasing incentives for adoption, creating legal and market structures to give resources for pregnant woman to carry to term, providing support, even if through charity, for unwed pregnant mothers.
@Teri_A_Adams With all of that said, if you can stop every abortion without these effects, I am in favor.  Birth control is a big factor....I struggle with any pro-life person who opposes birth control (as it then appears they care more about their religious view of sex then stopping abortion)
@Teri_A_Adams Thus, I see laws prohibiting abortion (1) being govt laws based on religious views, (2) leading to govt control over women's rights (as demonstrated by my previous examples) and (3) likely leading to increase in maternal fatalities in pregnancies.
@Teri_A_Adams This is clearly a religious test.  Indeed, when Roe v Wade ruling passed, Southern Baptist leader put out statement that this was a victory for religious freedom, allowing those who had different religious views to practice their viewpoint.
@Teri_A_Adams But you know full well a living human isn't the same as an embryo.  One can live on its own and the other cannot.  Much Western culture opposition to abortion arose from Christian denominations who believed soul entered child at conception.
@Teri_A_Adams What about father obligations....for unmarried couples, should child support payments begin at conception?  If same as new baby, why not?  What if baby is miscarried?  Do you need to repay?
@Teri_A_Adams Let's say mother drinks alcohol and loses pregnancy (or leads to genetic issues for baby born), is mother liable?  What if she didn't know she was pregnant?  She would likely know pregnancy possible from her actions, so doesn't she have obligations if same as living baby?
@Teri_A_Adams A baby in the womb cannot live on its own, it is not the same a person. But let's assume we give same protections.  If pregnant women works physical labor and baby dies from stress, is mother liable for manslaughter (as she would be if baby were living)?

But @AG_Conservative's underlying point shows current trend everywhere, where people ignore nuance and take views to their fullest extreme.  In absence of health risk, there is little justification for late term abortions, regardless of your view of earlier term abortion rights.
Very true...indeed, many pro-choice people I know are (like me) pro-life for themselves but (1) believe in imposing their moral views on others through govt., and (2) recognize banning abortion likely leads to massive unconstitutional expansion of govt power over women's lives. https://t.co/wikvHZl9uk

@MaxBoot There is significant percentage, likely a majority, of conservative principles with no representation in our government that really have been ignored for many years. GOP responses to your reasoned article unfortunately hint that such under-representation will likely continue. 8/8
@MaxBoot Goldwater put forth many great conservative ideals, though he often veered toward libertarianism and, as you highlight w/ nuclear threats over Hungary, certain of Goldwater's declarations were, at the time and now, extreme and outside any rational conservative discussion. /7
@MaxBoot The distortion of privatization rationale is emblematic of falsehoods prevalent throughout many foundational issues of conservativism, including rule of law, individuality, freedom/liberty, American exceptionalism and limited government.  /6
@MaxBoot Such blanket anti-govt claim has no conservative basis. Just as we look at the military and state that it is most efficient to have a national military guarding our borders, there are multiple (though still a minority) of areas where govt is more efficient than the pvt sector. /5
@MaxBoot But privatization wasn't the central goal.  Rather it was moving to the most efficient vehicle, subject to the limited powers of the government.  Yet now GOP has adopted a libertarian anti-govt facade that ignores inefficiency or costs but solely on anti-govt activity.  /4
@MaxBoot This concept was a foundation of moving from govt to private sector -- govt is large and often difficult to monitor and change, so in many cases it is not the most efficient choice.  During Buckley era, many thought govt always right choice, so emphasis was on privatization. /3
@MaxBoot One major factor underlying conservativism is the fallibility of humans.  As we know humans are imperfect, we resist radical change and ideas, move slowly in informed decisions and review evidence on current status and later changes to find most efficient options.  /2
@Sartor1836 I think you are missing PC's impetus. For example, polish and blond intelligence that were pervasive.  Or characters like Long Duck Dong in Sixteen Candles or Braves fans tomahawk chop, which were culturally insensitive.  PC was movement to change this.
@MaxBoot That may be your choice, but there is a wide array of options beyond Goldwater or Ike.  The far right forces have significantly twisted the public understanding of the meaning of "conservative" so it can be difficult to have material discourse w/o being called unconservative.  /1

To be clear, it wasn't @davidafrench's tweet that was blindly partisan, but rather the Cosby comparison he retweeted.
@davidafrench's tweet is just one of hundreds of examples. I wouldn't vote for Kavanaugh right now solely b/c  I'd want more information.  But vicious partisan fighting has made rational investigation and decision-making nearly impossible as anyone leaving trenches gets attacked.
Both sides have gone mad in this fight. We have no idea what Kavanaugh did or didn't do.  While I like his rulings generally, Leahy questioning and accusations make him a poor S.

@DavidAFrench We have allegations, yet no investigation, but there isn't enough evidence?  Isn't that the point of an investigation? Further, discussing  "burden of proof" is misleading; burden of proof required to limit govt abuse, not whether we need to rush vote for appointment to SCOTUS.

@CrusadersPost Thanks...I will make sure that my reasonsing to withhold judgement until we have facts doesn't preclude me from making a judgment based on facts.  Focusing on facts and reality is helpful, as you appear to be running from shadows right now.
@RickSaccone4PA @arlenparsa @realDonaldTrump It is only "hype" if someone you dislike is the speaker? Forecasting weather is based on probabilities and this forecase included many scenarios of larger storm.  Based on science, it wasn't overhyped then and POTUS's warning, while stronger than reality, is also good advice.
@CrusadersPost I appreciate your viewpoint, but "my narrative" is that no information has been released so we should withhold judgment until it is.  You have created a conspiracy out of existence of the letter. I truly pray you can keep an open mind and judge on facts, not preconceived fears.

@RBPundit Perhaps.  I watched Leahy questioning and thought it was valid. I am for full disclosure and transparency here, exactly as I was for Kagan, Sotomayor, etc. (and all docs should be released).  But Booker's documents show nothing surprising or illegal, so I think it backfires.

@EdWhelanEPPC But if you say it is impossible, here is a list of people and pictures who work at Kasowitz.  Do you have knowledge of ever speaking with any of them about the Mueller investigation?  Is that impossible?  Of course not (and if this was Kagan, you'd say none of it was difficult).

@marklevinshow @KenDiesel Note from next Democratic president to Mark Levin: If you criticize me, I will revoke the license of any radio station that broadcasts your show.  Is this a First Amendment issue?  You have no vested right to be on the air.
@dannyrussell53 @renato_mariotti You show no evidence other than they are universally condemning certain acts of Trump.  They aren't universally condemning tax cuts or deregulation (I read many media supporting these). They are condemning attacks on press and objectively bad acts like alleged Russia conspiracy.
@dannyrussell53 @renato_mariotti That is the problem I find with your position. You allege media colluding if all condemn a bad act.  You argue that President is merely concerned about group think and fairness when he calls factual reporting Fake News and enemy of the people.  But...
@dannyrussell53 @renato_mariotti Difference is that Trump said media is bad, and therefore you follow that belief.  Were you declaring media the enemy of the people when they uncovered Clinton's crimes, both in 1990s and now?  Did you support Obama's horrendous attacks on Fox?  Or is media only an enemy now?
@dannyrussell53 @renato_mariotti Do you believe the media is an "enemy of the people"?  I think, for example, terrorism is an enemy of the people.  Hostile nations like Russia fit this bill.  People who want to destroy the country...enemies of the people.  Do you include the media in this group?
@dannyrussell53 @renato_mariotti There has never been an overwhelming concern among rational minds that op eds and pundits as a threat to our country until Trump.  But Trump, who I am sure you will agree is more dishonest than any prior US President, the media is an "enemy of the people".
@dannyrussell53 @renato_mariotti People have a right to debate ideas. Free speech and free press are needed so that all ideas can be expressed and evaluated.  There is no "collusion" amongst newspapers on anything but supporting the 1st Amendment, which isn't controversial,
@dannyrussell53 @renato_mariotti That is not at all his broader point.  Any news against him is declared FAKE NEWS.  Like many demagogues, he is attempting to get his followers to believe he is the only reliable source of information.
@dannyrussell53 @renato_mariotti By your analysis of the President's intent, the Senate's unanimous resolution is also evidence they are engaged in group think and therefore probably an enemy of the people.  https://t.co/0zYcI8qsan
@dannyrussell53 @renato_mariotti While I disagree with it being obvious, there is some concept that factual reporting will be....similar, as facts are facts.  Regardless, that is not his point here,  He is stating that people condemning his attacks on freedom of the press are colluding.

@PeculiarBaptist @bethanyshondark Media (like every human) is never perfect and bias does exist.  But if you think this attached tweet is ok, whereby majority GOP believe media an enemy (and by logical step, wrong if it disagrees with Trump), please think back to your pre-Trump mindset. https://t.co/VJdWj5w0GM
@PeculiarBaptist @bethanyshondark Maybe we disagree on the concept of "enemy of the state".   I would consider Russia and North Korea to be "enemies of the state".  I consider Aldrich Ames to be an enemy of the state.  Somehow Chris Cuomo's views on the Unite the Right rally doesn't reach this level.
@PeculiarBaptist @bethanyshondark Did you agree with radical far leftists believing Fox was an enemy of the state that needed to be eradicated during Obama's tenure?  Their opinion shows spent 100s of hours on, amongst many other things, whether he was a Kenyan Muslim scheming against US.
@PeculiarBaptist @bethanyshondark Again, Chris Cuomo is an opinion show. Are you stating you understand believing an opinion show you disagree with demonstrates media is an "enemy of the state", i.e., that we need to eradicate differing opinion because they are a threat to our country?
@PeculiarBaptist @bethanyshondark Finally...even if you were right and media extensively reported POTUS's continual lies, does that make them an "enemy of the state"?  Wouldn't that actually make them a defender of the state?  POTUS's media attacks are wrong on every level and it isn't bias to oppose them.
@PeculiarBaptist @bethanyshondark Liberal bias comes in if you are discussing Rachel Maddow's focus.  It isn't relevant for news reports in NYT, WSJ, WP, LAT, Chicago Tribune or CNN. If you are on Twitter regularly, the screaming is deafening, but that isn't evidence of "liberal media", false reports.
@PeculiarBaptist @bethanyshondark His lies about things objectively wrong, and his followers believing him, is actually a very large story.  But you also are not accurate. The Russia story, Mueller investigation, witchhunt claims, etc. are far and away most covered in news stories.
@PeculiarBaptist @bethanyshondark There are many examples of liberal media bias, but they generally show up on the edges -- what stories are focused on most strongly in opinion sections, for example, and not actual attacks on facts.  None of that is relevant in this instance.
@PeculiarBaptist @bethanyshondark His efforts are having a terrible effect -- a normally thoughtful person such as yourself is now defending the argument that a universal rejection of the thought that the media is the enemy of the state is evidence of the bias of the rejecting parties.
@PeculiarBaptist @bethanyshondark When one person does many egregrious acts, factual reporting on such person is not going to be positive. Trump's acts, from constant lies to insulting allies to ignoring customs and advice to emoluments/retaining assets to the actual and alleged Russian crimes are unprecedented.
@PeculiarBaptist @bethanyshondark Media far from perfect, but you appear to state media is biased if they universally reported Watergate and the ensuing coverup was illegal. Or if they stated that conspiring with Russia to win an election was illegal.  Or if they report when a politician is not telling the truth.
@PeculiarBaptist @bethanyshondark Moreover, your statement itself evidences the risk we get from ignoring POTUS's acts.  No media "good will"?  In what?  Reporting the fake news (as screamed by Trump) that Russian meetings occurred? Or illegal activities happened?  Both are true.
@PeculiarBaptist @bethanyshondark That is about as much a non sequitur as possible. There is no "good will" here.  There is a POTUS expressly claiming media is the enemy of the people. Obama's attacks on Fox wrong and media all pushed back.  Trump's attacks worse and constant...no bias evident in opposing it.
What is wrong with these people?  Court's decision was, to me, a close call and I struggle with claiming religious liberty for baking cakes.  But now these people aren't actually innocent victims, but rather people just trying to attack this baker, which is much more disturbing. https://t.co/V3OzxYPctu

@aubrynathome @ReaganBattalion One other point....you claim I am trolling when you responded to me alleging my claim is wrong.  Very odd to see tweets from someone who claims to value Christ's Word when every tweet is unsubstantiated judgment and insults.
@aubrynathome I certainly would like to see evidence that this is true.  So far it appears it is solely your unsubstantiated beliefs that support this view.  I pray that God can help you clear your mind of animosity and think clearly rather than attacking unknown people based on your bias.
@aubrynathome When you fully consider your claim, you see it has no rational basis. You would never say that, for example, Mayo Clinic would fight to prevent a cure for cancer because it would cost them money. That is irrational. Yet you make this claim abortion doctors.
@aubrynathome Your statement claims abortion doctors solely care about money and would fight to keep abortions occurring even if we could make them unnecessary. Do you think this of others? Cancer docs hoping cancer never cured? Firemen stopping fire-retardant buildings?
@aubrynathome "Muted" surprises me based on your bio.  As a Christian, I strive to hear and understand others, and strive to work to assist those in need.  Here you judge others on a hypothetical solely based on your blind animosity toward them.
@aubrynathome @ReaganBattalion Again, nobody wants abortions. Nobody.  You are blinded by your hatred.

@baseballcrank At worst (as looks truer every day), he cares more about his ties to the Russians than the US.  Either way, that is not "a competent administration" who makes "the right call".  Rather, it is a threat to our country everyone should oppose, regardless of party or policy. /19
@baseballcrank he is trying to discredit, if not stop, any investigation of his connections with Russia or financial activities related thereto, and somehow the GOP is acquiescing.  My answer to my friend is clear...Trump is not like other politicians.  At best, he cares only about himself. /18
@baseballcrank Most importantly, he laundered money for Russia for decades, has nearly 100 meetings between his staff and Russians (including expressly to help with campaign), his administrative hiring have been heavily weighted with those with Russia connections, and..../17
@baseballcrank Retaining his business interests, pushing government resources to support them, pursuing legislation to better them is not normal politics.  His attacks on free press, religion, federalism and childish acts are not things we should overlook or ignore.  /16
@baseballcrank but such disagreements are the basis of America and are solved through political process.  Trump is not guided by his love of country.  He is solely focused on himself, his business, and being adored.  His acts (Qatar being a great example) all are about him, not the US.  /15
@baseballcrank why I push against Trump but didn't push so hard against Obama (for ex), when I greatly disliked his foreign policy and overregulation?  The answer is clear.  Obama, like all Presidents before him, was guided by his view on what was best for the country.  We may disagree /14
@baseballcrank I grew up in blue collar Democrat area, where I was one of few conservatives.  I expressed my views, volunteered with local and national candidates, but never pushed my opinions on others.  Many locals now have become Trump supporters.  They ask me... /13
@baseballcrank What is clear here is that Erickson did not need the Russian's assistance to turn himself against other Americans. Trump w/ Russia better, in his opinion, than a Dem. If he had power to choose, who would he want to win: Trump conspiring with Russia or HRC?  /12
@baseballcrank To clarify...Russians wanted to turn us against ourselves.  Media, a biased group working against conservatives, all state (no they don't) Russia stole election.  Thus Trump forced to deny it.  None of this is objectively true, even w/ his falsity that Russia didn't support Trump
@baseballcrank Next he says: "The truth is that the Russians wanted us turned against each other and looking inward. The media carrying water for the Democrats that Russia stole the election has only boxed the President into a position where he feels he must deny it to defend his victory." /11
@baseballcrank he can use his false allegation to state that "Because he won against the supposed chosen one, the idea that the Russians stole the election has become part of the Democrats' mythology."  Using a Russian attack on an American election to support Trump as an attack on Dems.. /10
@baseballcrank Erickson then goes on to rightfully compare Trump's acts to Obama's "apology tour".  But then states "There is no evidence the Russians wanted to get Donald Trump elected."  However, this is proven false...there is ample evidence they wanted Trump.  Erickson ignores this, as /9
@baseballcrank This is an example of the flip side of Trump undermining international relations...he now has thousands of supporters who think the media is the enemy, judges (if they disagree with him), FBI/intel, media and anyone else w/ differing opinion is an enemy.  A "competent" move? /8
@baseballcrank Erickson then states that Trump needed to stand up to Russia's meddling, rather than denying it occurred.  Yet not only does he deny it, he claims it is a witch hunt, a deep state after him and his supporters and villainizes FBI, intel and all others searching for the truth.
@baseballcrank Indeed, the few positive acts that have occurred are almost always done incompetently (tax cut rushed through w/o thought and creating largest projected deficit ever being a central example but far from the sole one).  /6
@baseballcrank Is it the "right call" to undermine NATO, criticize our allies, state the EU is a foe?  Is the constant claims of "fake news" and stating the media is the enemy of the country the "right call"?  Does a "competent administration" send childish tweets calling people names?  /5
@baseballcrank For example, he states "I want to support President Trump and, compared to his opponents and their rage, I at least know what I am getting with him -- a competent administration that tends to make the right call."  Is that correct?  Who believes this point?  /4
@baseballcrank He then rightfully mentions that other actions are less supportable (on a conservative or objective basis), such as tariffs.  But then he goes off into a fantasy land that highlights how important partisan fighting is to him, even when he decries it as a bad thing,  /3
@baseballcrank He rightfully lays out conservative and/or GOP (not at all the same anymore) acts he supports....conservative issues like many great judicial appointments, lower taxes and deregulation, GOP issues like moving embassy to Jerusalem and getting out of deals Obama created. /2
@baseballcrank Mr. Erickson's article is comparable to many who are trying to balance their desire to maintain distance from the "others" (i.e., those who don't like Trump, who no matter their political beliefs, are the "liberals") while criticizing one of the Presidents actions.  /1
@mhschrader @SenBobCorker I think there are things Sen Corker can do to limit the President's actions (stopping tariffs, reaffirming NATO/treaties, threatening independent counsel if Mueller fired).  But why would he block the appointment of a Supreme Court Justice with whom he approves?
@SenBobCorker Thank you Senator.  Take back the tariff right from President and override them.  Find sources of revenue (carbon credits?) that can alleviate the huge deficit created. Protect the Russian investigation...we can't give them free rein for further action.

@Kaitain_FL @_Drew_McCoy_ What are you stating?  Where am I stating "we shouldn't keep track of children"? You and initial poster said splitting families and imprisoning children comparable to working in an office or hospitals putting tags on children b/c all 3 involve name tags.  Your point is illogical.
@Kaitain_FL @_Drew_McCoy_ It appears you believe govt taking children from families and imprisoning them is comparable to safety measures at hospitals to ensure correct child identification.  Families are in the hospital by choice for requested care....is that the same as imprisonment?
