The $450 million for #LWCF is $144 million MORE than last year’s level. Great news for recreation projects across the country! #Outdoors4All
We will keep working for full and permanent funding for #LWCF, but a 3 year extension is a good start!  Thank you all for your support!!
City, local, state, and federal outdoor recreation needs will benefit from #LWCF funding in Omnibus bill.  Thanks Congress!
Although there is not a long term reauthorization for #LWCF, the Omnibus bill reauthorizes the program for 3 years.
#LWCF gets a big boost in Omnibus bill for FY 2016 - $450 mil for projects and a 3 year extension. https://t.co/nJ1qP76kUJ
