Two years of unified Rep. control of govt, a wall was never voted on. Americans rejected this idea in Nov. Now the President is holding gov‚Äôt workers hostage and jeopardizing livelihoods, to try and force funding for a wall.
Our national emergency is that the government is shutdown and it‚Äôs affecting people‚Äôs lives. We need to get the govt back open. Period. Then we can negotiate comprehensive immigration reforms separately.
We need comprehensive, compassionate, rational &amp; thoughtful immigration reform. Not an ineffective wall that is a waste of money and doesn‚Äôt address the actual problems with our current immigration system.
These claims by the administration are flat out false. Illegal border crossings are way down. We need to address the actual crisis of LEGAL asylum seekers ‚Äì families w/ children ‚Äì who flee their country and their treatment by our gov‚Äôt.
