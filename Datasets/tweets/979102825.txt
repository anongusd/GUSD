@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump 'legate', sympathizers should know that your consistent mini-series of tweets is a scripted template, part of a paid propaganda juggernaut
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump hey 'legate', people should realize that your tweets never deviate template b/c they come from a shared team of researchers &amp; propagandists
@FoxNews @kimguilfoyle @BetsyDeVosED no protests? proTrump 'angry' white males got that way b/c white students turning their backs on a black female speaker is racist misogyny.
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump how come you and the others always first to respond (instantaneously) to DT tweets do it in a series, identical templates?shared resources?
@williamlegate @realDonaldTrump as fast as trump tweets you respond-always-like 6 to 1. and always with screenshots, charts, vids, rare facts, articles. I call BS, 'legate'
