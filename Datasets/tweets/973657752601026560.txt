RT @realDonaldTrump: Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. I don’t believe he made memos…
@JimCarrey PS Sarah H. Sanders is an amazing person!
@realDonaldTrump I hope you also fire Robert Mueller. They were all fake  and only served Democrats. Robert Mueller only for Democrats and not for you and American people. Please fire him.
