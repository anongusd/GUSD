@1VA2021 @a_chase11 NOVA/DC Swamp Virginia is full of Californians, Texans, New Yorkers &amp; Floridians drawn to the DC/NOVA Swamp. These are not Real Virginians. Real Virginians are a minority in the NOVA Swamp - it does not represent Virginia although it is taking over and swallowing the State.
@1VA2021 @a_chase11 One Virginia - you are heading in the right direction - however you must Drain the NOVA Swamp from Virginia to stick up for Real Virginians. Only then can there be fair elections again in Virginia. #DRAINNOVASWAMP #DRAINDCSWAMP

@Klayton83 @RealResistance6 @drawandstrike Why wouldn't he declassify all of it? There was no conspiracy afterall was there?!?! What on earth is there to hide and why is Trump hiding what happened to JFK?!?!? Makes no sense. Killed by LHO. Clearly.
@RealResistance6 @drawandstrike Trump has declassifed all documents related to the Kennedy assassination. Over 50 years after the event all the documents have finally been declassified. As you can see. There was no conspiracy. It's just amazing it took over 50 years to declassify Kennedy documents. Why so long?
@WildBillPatriot @drawandstrike Jeff Sessions is Draining the Swamp. We just don't know it yet because he's keeping it hidden and secret. He's operating in "Stealth Mode" as our day and age's pre-eminent crime fighter. All will be revealed at the most opportune time to win the elections!
@ItsjustJimmy @drawandstrike @vabelle2010 I think its actually 50,000 now isn't it! HELLUVA BS "Conspiracy Theory" that is. Completely useless and NOTHING exposed and NO INDICTMENTS of conspirators before the Mid-Terms. Where is this "Stealth Jeff" and what is he doing? He's doing NOTHING!!
@drawandstrike So why hasn't AG Jeff Prosecuted these criminals? What the hell is he waiting for? Trump to lose the House? How does that help? Prosecuting would destroy the Democrats and turn the House Ultra Red. But 18 months and NOTHING except speculation and "theories"... Not impressed.
@drawandstrike Who is this "Stealth Jeff" and what is he doing? Why is this genius letting the Mid-Term election take place with next to no indictments and prosecutions of corrupt FBI &amp; DOJ officials who plotted a coup against Trump. How can Jeff leave the President exposed SO BADLY? Idiot.
