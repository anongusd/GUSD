--Trump was criticized for closing out his campaign with an ad denouncing an international global power structure that featured a number of prominent Jews in the financial industry, including Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein.
--In early July, Trump posted on Twitter an image of the Star of David shape next to a picture of Clinton atop a pile of money, calling her the ‚Äúmost corrupt candidate ever.‚Äù
--In a December 2015 speech before the Republican Jewish Coalition, Trump said: ‚ÄúAnd I know why you‚Äôre not going to support me. You‚Äôre not going to support me because I don‚Äôt want your money. Isn‚Äôt it crazy?‚Äù
--Trump came under fire for White House statement on Int. Holocaust Memorial Day that failed to mention the Jewish faith of the millions of ‚Äúinnocent people‚Äù who were killed and the anti-Semitism that led to their slaughter. It was a break with the tradition of past presidents.
-- Trump was asked twice on separate occasions about rising anti-Semitism, including by a Jewish reporter in a press conference. He responded by shouting down the reporter and insisting he is ‚Äúthe least anti-Semitic person that you‚Äôve ever seen in your entire life.‚Äù
--According to the Anti-Defamation League, Twitter users had viewed language associated with anti-Semitism more than 10 billion times in 2016, the social media equivalent of a $20 million Super Bowl ad
--Repeated failure ‚Äî with 4 diff. attempts ‚Äî during CNN intervu to condemn former KKK leader David Duke. Later he said ‚Äòdisavow‚Äô on Twitter.
