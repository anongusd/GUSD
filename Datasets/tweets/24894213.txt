The issue isn‚Äôt nudging women to run. They want to. The institutions need to change. Until then, donating to these candidates is a great way to help.
The women hired under quotas are highly qualified, more educated and experienced.
Countries that have proportional representation elect more women, lgbt politicians, and are more likely to adopt quotas. https://t.co/zYd1cUoaqz
There are far more campaign training programs for democrat women than republican women.
Primaries tend to select extreme candidates, ruling out more moderate republican women candidates.
Another obstacle is implicit bias against women and stereotypes of masculinity. From 2012 to 2016, republican voters have become more willing to own sexist views.
Women have no problem raising money but donate less than men to political campaigns due in part to the gender wage gap.
We are seeing a dramatic increase in women running for office as of the most recent election. https://t.co/ghDek9OD18
The primary reason for poor representation of women in government is an over representation of male incumbents . But another major factor is lack of motivation to run.
When we take into account the ‚Äúyear of the woman‚Äù the US meets the average for women‚Äôs representation in politics.

Q&amp;A time! https://t.co/GI8XRphJjU
Peiss attributes renewed interest in the books to their tangibility in an increasingly digital world.
Recently, an open source digital map was made tracing their origins.
In the mid 1990s as holocaust awareness increased, the books resurfaced as objects worthy of study. In 2001 the library of Congress developed a virtual library of these texts.
The org believed there was no future for Jews in Europe and sent 40% of the books to Israel, 40% to the US and 20% to the rest of the world.
A German org (ironically) dedicated to preserving Jewish history during the war worked to categorize 2.5 million looted books. A Jewish org eventually inherited the right to repatriate the texts.
The other collection of books were looted from Jewish families and hidden in secret caches.
Initially, the collection was barely organized, much to the consternation of Librarians. This rendered the books all but invisible for years. https://t.co/nLw3xGbyD3
Post war, the American library community and newspaper industry protested the destruction of militaristic/nazi books, arguing that they should be preserved for posterity.
Peiss: two kinds of WWII book collections held at Penn: those removed from Germany as a part of denazification and those looted from Jewish families.
Dr. Peiss will be discussing ‚ÄúLooted Jewish books, Nazi collections, and their American afterlives.‚Äù We‚Äôll be sharing excerpts here over the next hour or so; stay tuned! https://t.co/JEtr3fSt4o
