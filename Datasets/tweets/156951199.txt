@victorpage2 @ClistonBrown i understand what you are saying.  i still think dems can be big tent, and it may be part of a winning strategy.  i think climate is going to be the number one issue.  gop got nothing on that.
@shuboogie my original response to her:		https://t.co/UEWU9EG7JX		good discussion, i am trying to provide positive dissent in progressive flames, so even if we disagree there is a chance to at least understand each other.
@shuboogie @SaneDaysFan yes!
@SaneDaysFan @shuboogie He has moved the conversation in the direction I like.  I love alexandria.  what are your thoughts there?
@SaneDaysFan @shuboogie if i am wrong, i want to know, thank you.  i thought you were insulted by her tearing down kamala and in turn you were tearing down bernie.  your lead made me misinterpret your first bullet. i get what you are saying, you were doing both?  sorry, i got stuck on the lead. ttyl :-)
@shuboogie yes, what you just said makes perfect sense.  i am with you.  I didn't understand that from your first response.  i do not know lauren other than her tweet, but let's see if we can persuade her to promote her candidate, and not tear others down too.
@shuboogie @SaneDaysFan do and say what you want.  i have decided at this point to stand up when i see mud flying, to simply get us all to consider coming together while we debate these issues.  if that is a given, then please forgive me, &amp; flame on...
@shuboogie @SaneDaysFan i had the same reaction to the original tweet you had, and i said the same thing to her that i am say to you.  no mud.
@shuboogie @SaneDaysFan i don't want to grow up, sometimes i think growing up is understanding how to become and defend the kid we once were, and stop worrying about those who want us to be something else.  i don't think any progressives should step aside.  we all need to stand up and do this together.
@SaneDaysFan @shuboogie preach!  i am with you!
@shuboogie i never said you were a toddler.  i like your tweets.  i hate to see lauren, you, me, us throw mud at each other.  i don't care why allies hate each other.  i'm not looking for least worst.  i want to know why the best candidate is the best.

@victorpage2 @ClistonBrown would you say the DNC was impartial in the primary leading up to 2016?
@shuboogie you are angry and want someone to blame, but these are the people we must unite with for the bigger effort.  before election day 2020, we all have to put 2016 behind us, forgive, forget, and focus on the most positive candidate.  not vote against the one we hate the most.
@Lauren_Steiner @KamalaHarris Don't hate on fellow dems.  Let's instead talk about who you are supporting, and why they are so awesome.

@zardeefonder @EFF @JRosenworcel @InStyle Yes, but without #NetNeutrality their packets to their consumers might get discriminated against based on source, destination, or content. If you, a friend, relative, or your child decided to start a business online, wouldn't you want a free and fair playing field?
@zardeefonder @EFF @JRosenworcel @InStyle What is your concern?  That they do or do not communicate?
@zardeefonder @EFF @JRosenworcel @InStyle I'm pretty sure ISPs are making tons of money.
@zardeefonder @EFF @JRosenworcel @InStyle does your work involve the internet?
@zardeefonder @EFF @JRosenworcel @InStyle Emergency vehicles are significantly different from consumers' streaming videos.  The situation is more akin to a world where you have to get out of the way for rich, wealthy, and powerful driver.
@zardeefonder @EFF @JRosenworcel @InStyle ISPs are making money. The internet &amp; #NetNeutrality are a threat to established money &amp; power. With NN small businesses (mom &amp; pop shops) are as available to end users as huge corporations. NN gives them a fighting chance, without NN the little player is at a worse disadvantage.

@zardeefonder @EFF @JRosenworcel @InStyle #NetNeutrality existed before it became a regulation.  All the big telecom corporations are trying to make it seem like it was created by overreaching government regulations, but that's totally bogus.
@zardeefonder @EFF @JRosenworcel @InStyle That's why #NetNeutrality is so important.  The ISPs are often monopolies, and they are trying to steal our digital rights and sell them back to us.  It's total BS.
@zardeefonder @EFF @JRosenworcel @InStyle #NetNeutrality is dead simple: a packet comes in to a router and the router turns around and sends it on it way toward its destination address.  All packets are treated equally: first come, first served.  No discrimination based on source, destination, or content.
@zardeefonder @EFF @JRosenworcel @InStyle Will there be transparency so consumers know that the ISPs are managing traffic fairly and as they claim?  How many ISP options are available to you currently? Will I as a consumer be given #netneutrality as an option?
@zardeefonder @EFF @JRosenworcel @InStyle Did this really happen?  How would you prioritize video versus linux distributions?  Would the ISPs prioritize any video equally? or just for the providers who pay? or just for the content that is associated with their huge corporation? or just for the videos the ISP agrees with?

@kupuguy @raymondh Good point!  It looks like float mantissas are normalized between 1 and 2, which would mean the result of adding two mantissas would be between 2 and 4, and would therefore get normalized between 1 and 2 again with a different exponent.

@raymondh lossless because the base and exponent ensure that the calculations occurring are at the same "resolution"? super cool. ive thought about this before. awesome to have words to talk about it. when one adds numbers from 2 binades, what is lost? precision or accuracy?
@_ransomware @Caleb_Speak @raymondh I think I got it now. 	These are part of the same base 10 binade:  	{ 0.123*10**3, 3.45*10**3, 7.89*10**3}	and these are part of the same base 2 binade:	{ 9.87*2**7, 6.54*2**7, 0.321*2**7}	So a binade has the same BASE &amp; exponent? (same base was assumed in @raymondh's init post?)
Grassroots is the only legitimate way to do it! https://t.co/Jqvhfv3VVx
@raymondh ok, so in this equation: y = x**z, which would be the binade, the x or the y?

@QueenMab87 @dcinsb @NotOnMyWatchTV I'm aware dems are working hard.  I love the excitement around #AlexandriaOcasioCortez and some local candidates in my neighborhood.  I was responding to the initial tweet (not yours) that was unnecessarily harsh, and not constructive.  I'm hoping we can come together.
@QueenMab87 i hear you.  	i'm a fan of approval voting:  a yes/no for every candidate.  prevents 3rd candidates from splitting majorities.
@QueenMab87 @dcinsb @NotOnMyWatchTV yes, let's learn!  that's great news.  üåä!!!

@QueenMab87 @NotOnMyWatchTV good points.  all the issues you mention were unfortunately contributing factors.  good discussion. thank you.
@dcinsb @QueenMab87 @NotOnMyWatchTV it has been shoved and i feel it.  	:-(  	when bernie lost he told his supporters to vote for hillary.  it would have been much worse for hillary had he ran as a third (4th, 5th, whatever).  	the democratic party has the opportunity to learn from the last election, or lose again.
@QueenMab87 @NotOnMyWatchTV the distortion of the electoral college rendered the people's will moot.  it is a shame.
@MaggieDog01 @NotOnMyWatchTV i am hurt by your words.  i feel misjudged.
@QueenMab87 @NotOnMyWatchTV i got blocked by@notonmywatchtv i am now sad (sincerely).  i thought it was a good discussion.
@NotOnMyWatchTV we have to talk to hash this out if things are going to change.  what did i say?
@QueenMab87 @NotOnMyWatchTV it is upsetting, but it is true
@QueenMab87 @NotOnMyWatchTV she won only among registered democrats, then she lost among the general population
@QueenMab87 @NotOnMyWatchTV because of fear or hope that the numbers would change?  whatifs are pointless.  question is, will democrats learn from their mistakes?  or double down on losing strategies?
@QueenMab87 @NotOnMyWatchTV you are right, but why go with the candidate in 2nd place with the general population?
@dustinhines @NotOnMyWatchTV just saying, the democrats ignored the momentum of the general population that the poll data suggested, and went with the worry and fear of being too liberal for the middle.  it was a losing calculation.
@NotOnMyWatchTV i hear you, but before hillary beat bernie, he was beating her in many polls. *polls including all voters, not just registered democrats.  short sited of establishment democrats not to have gone with the candidate that had the highest probability of winning?
@NotOnMyWatchTV many polls had sanders doing better than clinton against trump (or any other gop candidate for that matter).
