Among people who paid attention to the Cohen hearing:		-42% say Dems in Congress were making a good faith attempt to get to the truth, 42% playing politics		-25% say GOP in Congress were making a good faith attempt to get to the truth, 58% playing politics

Of course, as the report notes, there's another side to this: that stability also means that the last year of Trump's attacks on the investigation haven't worsened views, either.
@KyleOrl Maybe? I think a lot of things that Trump has actually done with little effect to his ratings would have polled badly if tested as hypotheticals in advance.
It's not that nothing affects Trump's numbers at all. But to the extent that we can ever sort out causation, the events that have seemed to hurt him, at least temporarily, have been policy failures: AHCA, the shutdown.

@robinsline Per that survey, 8% of Dems have strongly unfavorable views of Sanders, 8% have strongly unfavorable view of Gabbard https://t.co/KcHGLStozu

@1kyletaylor Dropping just Sanders from the first list gets it to 51%. Dropping Sanders/Gabbard to 56%.
I'm quoting this again, because it's apt: "When voters are required to make an electoral choice among multiple candidates within the same party, their preferences will be relatively weak, unpredictable, based on limited information, and open to change"  https://t.co/DUy47UDpTj
Another pair: Only 8% of Dems who like Booker dislike Warren. Only 11% of Dems who like Warren dislike Booker.
To pick two candidates more or less at random: only 18% of Dems who like Kamala Harris have an unfavorable view of Bernie Sanders. Only 12% of Dems who like Sanders have an unfavorable view of Harris.
Per last week's Economist/YouGov, 47% of Democrats don't have an unfavorable view of ANY of the following: Booker, Buttigieg, Castro, Delaney, Gabbard, Gillibrand, Harris, Klobuchar, Sanders, Warren		Drop Gabbard, who has highest unfavs, you're up to 51%.

Here's the data mentioned in that first tweet:  In March 2015, GOP said 57/36 that they wanted a candidate with "experience and a proven record," rather than "new ideas and a different approach." By September, they were 65/29 for "new ideas." https://t.co/cUmvexox4O

Your first of what I'm sure will be many reminders that what partisans say they're looking for in a nominee is partly influenced by whom they're supporting, rather than the other way around.		e.g. in 2016, GOP largely wanted an establishment candidate until Trump picked up steam.

@KimberlyNalder Definitely a consideration! (And one reason the other answer choice was phrased as "similar to actions taken by past presidents")
FWIW, this split lines up with polls taken prior to Trump's declaration.		What's driving the difference in our poll: modestly lower support among Trump voters, combined with less back among non-voters/3rd party voters. Clinton voters almost unanimously hate both. https://t.co/PSWsZ8a4hZ

What made the shutdown politically damaging was like a month's worth of stories about federal workers flooding to food banks, national parks being defiled and airports descending into worse-than-usual level of chaos.
Declaring a national emergency polls horribly, but I have to think the extent to which people *care* about it happening depends a great deal on whether it involves the same level of obvious pain points as the shutdown.

You may, of course, recall last year's State of the Union, the truly game-changing speech that marked the beginning of an exciting new era in Trump's presidency, and then was promptly forgotten in about three hours.
Links: 		https://t.co/umbgM8RLlp		https://t.co/xgTv4LOxor
For apples-to-apples comparison, per CBS/YouGov, Trump's SOTU this year was received about the same as last year's (in both, about 3/4 of viewers approved).		Both years' audiences also had nearly identical party composition (42/43% GOP, 24/25% Dems, rest independents).

Will also just briefly note that pretty much everyone at HuffPost and BuzzFeed who was laid off this week is leaving behind co-workers and friends who think the world of them, which is not something you can say for most recent White House departures.
I could spend the next 30 minutes feeling very angry that the president of my country tweeted this, but instead I'm going to use that time to reread a former colleague's story about the life-saving power of empathy.		If you'd like to join me: https://t.co/PiFyQJcLnX https://t.co/9dSlwnvtbR

TRUMP CAN'T FIND WALL DOUGH

So this is one of those things where cause and effect are sort of hard to unpick. Trump's core supporters really, really want to see a wall. But you can see how that might be at least partially because Trump has made the wall such a central talking point.
We've been tracking whether people think Trump will live up to his campaign promises and which ones they think are most important. Last year, as Trump voters' belief that Obamacare would be repealed fell, so did the importance they placed on it.
If recent history is any guide, it's worth noting that failing to repeal the ACA hurt Trump temporarily with his base and then they more or less got over it. https://t.co/KfqcOSt81C

Also worth noting that although polls have generally shown Trump's numbers dipping, the AP-NORC poll is one of the most dramatic to date. e.g. CBS, also released today, had Trump's approval down 3 points since November.
Several things to hold in mind simultaneously:	-Trump is generally unpopular	-Trump's numbers have remained stable within an extremely small range	-Shutdown is dragging Trump back toward bottom of the range	-That is obviously bad, but not necessarily permanent

At this point, there have been endless big stories that have significantly improved our understanding of the Trump/Russia links but done relatively little to move the needle in polling, especially in any sustained sort of way.
Will leave the legal implications of the latest Russia story to people better qualified to discuss it but, as always, I would be surprised if it significantly moved public opinion. Solely from an approval ratings standpoint, the shutdown seems like Trump's much bigger problem.

(Also: Kellyanne Conway was a well-established professional pollster before her work with the Trump campaign. So, to state the obvious, it's not like they don't know all of this.)
And just to reiterate, since I think sometimes the point gets elided: the problem is not that they're online. There are plenty of scientific online polls. The problem is the lack of any provisions for sampling or weighting.
In the next couple of months, we're likely going to see more and more of these sorts of reader polls coming back along with the start of Dem primary season.  But even when there's not a systematic effort by a campaign to rig them, they are still of extremely limited utility.
For instance: 38% of a nationally representative sample of Americans said that they'd had an argument about the 2016 election. When I included a reader poll with the same question in a story, 72% of HuffPost readers who answered said that they had. https://t.co/7UiwWnbLXy
The people reading any particular website aren‚Äôt representative of the public at large. Those who take the time to read a particular story ‚Äï and to weigh in on it ‚Äï are even less so.		And that's before getting into bad-faith attempts like those mentioned in the WSJ story.
That‚Äôs why a poll that reaches relatively few people can accurately depict the opinions of a much larger group.		 In contrast, reader polls don't represent anything beyond the number of people who happen to have clicked on them. And they can be gamed.
To elaborate a bit on this point, a quick primer. 		Scientific polls, whether conducted by phone calls, using online panels, or in some other way, use a mix of sampling/weighting to make their numbers representative of a larger population (e.g. Americans, or likely voters).
A poll that does not exert some measure of control over who takes it and how many times they do so is not a poll and you should ignore it. https://t.co/0zkGQiGhlg

@BenjySarlin I still remember the week when it was supposedly going to doom the GOP in 2014!
Three final thoughts:		1. I'm pretty comfortable saying that, post-holidays, we're starting to see concerns about the shutdown starting to ramp up.		2. Nobody in Washington comes out looking good, but GOP is faring worse.		3. The political effects of shutdowns tend to wear off.
Notably, we haven't -- unless I've missed it -- seen a single live-caller poll of the shutdown since it started.
A couple of other polls, meanwhile, find slightly higher percentages of the public now assigning Trump the *most* blame -- shift is very modest but pretty uniform. 	 https://t.co/owGkiBSAGl https://t.co/z8LYYrzWar
@EmGusk üôè
RT @EmGusk: Social media is not a reflective sample of any group of people https://t.co/6TxrpgsQRp
FWIW, the numbers on who's at least partially responsible for the shutdown have been fairly stable:		Week 1*: 49% Trump, 40% Ds, 33% Rs	Week 2: 51% Trump, 44% Ds, 36% Rs	Week 3: 51% Trump, 41% Ds, 35% Rs		*Half sample
I think I'm probably a little more inclined toward the latter, but that judgment is driven at least partially by the fact that I don't see much in the news that would necessarily account for that pattern.
You can read the movement in the second polls and reversion in the third here either as Congress (and Dems/own reps) taking a minor additional hit right before New Year's and then recovering, or just the fluctuations inherent to tracking polls being tracking polls. https://t.co/NM0zhpcQPc

23% also now say they are or expect to be affected by this shutdown, up from 10% when it started. Sometimes that "effect" is vague (yes, people, what the government does affects everyone) but other respondents talked about furloughs, missed paychecks, canceled trips.

Doubling down on it probably does makes the people in his base who already like the idea place more importance on it, but I'm not sure if that is especially helpful for this administration, per se.
Since Trump took office, Americans have grown more supportive of active foreign policy, free trade, and immigrants' contributions to America. I do not think public support for the wall is going to grow substantially.
Can someone explain the word "thermostatic" to Jared? https://t.co/nT5jVN2ZG4
Anyways, that's all to say that this kind of data is in many ways a public service, and that although Gallup isn't the only purveyor, their movement away from this space is arguably pretty unfortunate.
Approval ratings aren't just about who's up or down. They provide historical context, and a broad, real-time framework what we want to see from our leaders. Perhaps most importantly, they highlight who feels they're being well served by their government -- and who doesn't.
I think there's a tendency to conflate approval numbers with general horserace polling, but I would argue that there are a lot of good reasons to care what Americans think about the president that do not have to do with whether or not he'll be re-elected.
Still at daily/weekly: YouGov, Ipsos, Civiqs, Morning Consult, Rasmussen -- notably (and this is an observation, not a de facto criticism) all online or IVR polls, not live-caller. Live phone calls are EXPENSIVE.

@pbump liddle shutdown
Part of it seems to be editorial: concerns, especially post-2016, about overfocus on horserace numbers. Part of it is certainly financial: political polling is often subsidized by the parts of market research that actually make money.
It's not a completely uniform trend: there are still a ton of people doing great work in this sphere, and see, for instance, NYT's new investment in House polling last cycle. But it's certainly a notable sea change.
So in the last couple of years:	-Gallup ends horserace polling, daily approval tracker, "spot" polls	-Pew announces it's moving away from horserace polls	-SurveyMonkey just ended weekly approval tracker	-AP no longer leading stories with horserace numbers
PS, this, from George Gallup, is a great quote: "If democracy is supposed to be based on the will of the people, someone should find out what that will is."
FWIW, based on their output over the last year or so, it seems a lot this change has already been somewhat in the making.
@Frank_Newport More from the release: "Gallup's contribution will be deeper, long-trend dives into the most serious issues of the day worldwide, such as trust in governments, capitalism vs. socialism, and the future of work."
@Frank_Newport In the announcement, they write that electoral polling is "well covered now by a plethora of polling organizations." Still a change that will definitely be felt by anyone following public opinion, especially given the company's unparalleled historic trendlines.
WOW. @Frank_Newport stepping down, and Gallup taking another step away from politics: no "spot" polls on breaking news, significantly less "coverage of the electorate." Follows Gallup's decision to stop horserace polling post 2012 and end daily approval tracker last year. https://t.co/pshpzmiN36

@RadioFreeTom @pklinkne There's a difference between a) I think this question produces bias and b) I think the question was explicitly written to produce bias. I don't buy a), but I'm more than willing to hear it out. But that's not what "research designs determined to prove it's not true" is alleging.
@RadioFreeTom @pklinkne And question wording is always tricky and always up for debate.		But I don't write survey questions in the hopes of proving a point and honestly I'm not going to waste my time arguing with people who are under the presumption that I do.
@RadioFreeTom @pklinkne I asked for stats because I wanted to know if you did have data to the contrary. If you want to argue that extant public opinion data is for whatever reason failing to capture the on-the-ground reality of vaccines, then, OK.
@RadioFreeTom @pklinkne *leads you to
@RadioFreeTom @pklinkne What specifically about the wording of the question leads to you think it is biased or that it was designed to produce a particular result?
@RadioFreeTom @pklinkne Our question is entirely about the science and doesn't mention the government (and wasn't designed to prove anything), so I'm not really clear what you're arguing here beyond the vague insinuation that I'm somehow acting in bad faith by asking if you have actual numbers.

Obviously, none of this translates into unified views about policy, especially once you start talking specifically about undocumented immigrants.		But straight up nativism remains a fringe sentiment in this country.
From this October: Just 14% of Americans say immigrants make US society worse. Barely over a quarter of Republicans believe that. Even fewer Democrats and independents do. https://t.co/SIExXbhoLD
For all the partisan gridlock in the U.S., there are still some positions with broad, bipartisan support. One of them, from June: Americans say 75% to 19% that immigration is a good, not a bad, thing for the country. Highest margin since at least 2001.		https://t.co/HJMiUDjQzE

@DocHeatherB Any time you find yourself starting a sentence with "we've all" it's probably worth stepping back to consider exactly who "we" is.		(And I cover public opinion so...I'll be continuing to talk about it.)
So, anyways, recent history would tell us that the latest salvo in the Russia investigation is not going to Change Everything either but Trump would probably be doing himself a favor if he can bring himself to shut up about it.
2. Trump tends to see his numbers drop when he makes himself the center of attention
Two thoughts:		1. Public opinion on Trump/Russia has been, so far, exceptionally sticky -- if you're looking for the issue that'll move Trump supporters, this is prob not best bet. (Remember when the Helsinki meeting was going to Change Everything? Or indictments? Or...)

What's worth watching is the 23% who say Trump hasn't yet brought back manufacturing jobs, but is likely to. Most are Trump supporters, but they're not especially staunch ones.

@DavidWebsterJr Both, actually. (I wrote the article!)
@joshchafetz Ha...10% said they were very likely to *discuss* politics, 29% at least somewhat likely
One reason: Thanksgiving dinners are largely politically sorted.  Last year, just under a quarter of Americans with Thanksgiving dinner plans said they would be sitting down with both supporters of Trump and backers of Clinton.
These 3% must be the most disproportionately catered-to news consumers in all history.
Last year, just 3% of Americans going to a Thanksgiving thought it was very likely that there'd be an argument about politics at dinner https://t.co/4efBwlqhVe
