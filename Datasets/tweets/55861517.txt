@mitchellvii The only crisis was caused by Trump. He created a humanitarian crisis with zero tolerance, and now he is going dictator to deal with the "crisis" he himself created. Pure Reichstag crap, but this time, done in the open with the complicity of racist, fascist Republicans.

@Sheryl102958 @TomiLahren Social democrats are not commies, but Trump is in fact a fascist, and actual Nazis support him.
@wondershowers05 @mitchellvii Nah, you are a liar like your cult leader. If you didn't hate immigrants, you would want to legalize the ones who are here, and remove national quotas. However, you obviously favor continuing the racist Republican war on immigrants. Anyway. blocking you for being evil.

@TomiLahren Trump is worse than the Dems, by far. He is a fascist and threatens to destroy our democratic republic, if we let him. The Dems are basic social democrats. They may spend too much, or regulate too much, but they work within our system.

@RealCandaceO @IlhanMN Yes, anyone against diversity is racist. Anyone who uses anecdotes as evidence is making the error that leads to racism. America is a nation of immigrants, so diversity is precisely what made America great. To be anti-diversity is to be unAmerican, and yes, racist.
@realDonaldTrump Turning away refugees is a crime against humanity. Immigrants are GOOD for America, you racist jerk. Since immigrants, even the undocumented, are less criminal than native born, your wall, if it works, will increase crime. #Resign
