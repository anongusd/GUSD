@Ms_Liz2 @thomaskaine5 The Franciscans have a concept of work as prayer. My engineer uncle who survived the camp brutality with my parents joined them as a lay brother, refusing to become a priest. I think of him working as prayer.

@Ms_Liz2 @thomaskaine5 I live this. Was raised Catholic by concentration camp survivors who attributed it their existence. With difficulty I weaned myself to the agnostic prayer of "I don't know."
