@PrimetimePurity I think she is safe to do whatever she wants.
@ericowensdc @fredbauerblog That can happen. There are a lot of economists, and quite a bit of empirical data, that would tell you this is no mathematical certainty. Periods and ends of story aside.
@TheRightsWriter @WAPolicyGreen Hey hey
There is an important argument to be had over whether the post-9/11 AUMF -- which I supported -- has grown into a blank check for war far removed from 9/11 perpetrators. But AOC clearly blundered into said argument by making a too cute point about Iraq disaster, mixing up wars. https://t.co/Q7JSBW58PF

@ARDFootball If you hate nonwhites, you will probably root for white players. But you have to ignore a lot of contrary evidence to draw a straight line between 1970s Boston racism and current NE management, much less the more comprehensive 2019 Spencerite racism.

@DanFosterType @theodorekupfer @ElliotSKaufman Were/are Gronk/Edelman/Welker/Woodhead bad players? And is there not a long list of black players dating back to Lawrence Taylor with which Belichick is identified? The whole idea that this is nefarious strikes me as dumb.
@ElliotSKaufman @DanFosterType To me, it plays into white nationalists' hands to say there is something wrong with having some white dudes on a sports team where there are also numerous nonwhite stars excelling.
@ARDFootball I'm sure he's a fan of all the Euros in the NBA too but that doesn't mean they are basketball's white nationalists.
@DanFosterType Belichick's gift as a GM has been finding treasures in other teams' trash heaps, which includes some white wide receivers and running backs. But a huge number of his stars have been black.
@DanFosterType No question that is true. But Wes Welker and Julian Edelman don't cancel out Deion Branch and Randy Moss, Rex Burkhead and Danny Woodhead don't cancel out James White and Kevin Faulk.
Also Kraft gives most of his political contributions to Democrats, is more liberal than not, opposed Trump's criticism of kneeling players and like the Clintons became friendly with pre-political Trump.
Ty Law, Kevin Faulk, Deion Branch, Troy Brown and Vince Wilfork were some of the most important players in franchise history and are not white dudes, but whatevs, clicks, amirite. https://t.co/g7DFRtBmGv

@KevinWGlass Could happen here too. Could get decent border security funding with no large-scale amnesty/legalization of undocumenteds and would still be seen as cave because no huge wall.
@ashsoles Dems have been moving in the direction of calling fencing "not walls" and Trump calling it "sorta walls" for weeks. There's a lot of room to check some boxes here and still get nothing that will actually keep anybody out.
Only meaningful spending win over Obama and lots of Republicans were never fully comfortable with it, especially on defense. https://t.co/9ChyfLnuZE
@ashsoles There were plenty of border bells and whistles Dems were already willing to fund, even getting close to Trump's spending levels. Can't count as win until recommendations seen, made part of deal.
The party viewed as shutting down the government over an unrelated policy issue usually loses the shutdown. This time they had Trump on TV owning it from Day One.
But that was a situation where Republicans still held the House and you had a bunch of red state Democrats up for reelection that year who didn't want to keep the government shut down over an immigration dispute.
That might have emboldened Trump on this shutdown, especially since the polling wasn't kind to his DACA position and Senate Democrats still caved.
Republicans have prevailed on exactly one major shutdown fight in recent memory -- last year's stalemate over DACA.

@IAMMGraham Calm down. "Nominal" means just that. Nancy Pelosi does not say she opposes legal abortion in most cases and does not self-describe as pro-life. He does, even as his voting record has grown more pro-choice over time.

More conservatives are opposed to Gang of Eight-style comprehensive immigration reform, but many see the border barriers that were supposed to buy their support for such bills as the endgame.

@scoots2112 That she repeatedly denied it before then was my whole point.
@scoots2112 Yes. https://t.co/PzirZOlXo9
She was, however, taking the "hard look" line on a presidential bid by election day.
Elizabeth Warren would have still been reelected if she had straightforwardly admitted throughout her Senate campaign that she planned on running for president. But she might have been held below 60 percent of the vote.

@Jamie_Weinstein Is there any evidence for this? There was a large nonwhite audience for The Apprentice too, yet that did not translate into a large nonwhite vote for Trump.
@ericowensdc The quote conveys that impression even if that is not the intent. And there are literally many people who believe foreign inteventions do more to keep us safe than homeland security that starts at border.
@Jamie_Weinstein Yet in 2016 that brand appealed very disproportionately to working class whites and he flipped Rust Belt states, however narrowly.

@DavidMarkDC ...Dubya had the advantage of having the exact same name as his father, which inflated his name ID in the early polling. Jeb! would have just shared surname.
@DavidMarkDC True, but he would have gotten a lot of establishment support at a time when it mattered against a relatively weak field, with the exception of McCain who was dependent on independents voting in open primaries. Then again...

@alweaver22 Bush 41 was still alive for Trump's inaugural and wasn't present. Ex-presidents going to inaugural also fairly recent development, helps with divisive elections like 2000 and 2016.
The deaths of ex-presidents. Reagan gathered his living predecessors at the White House before sending them to represent him at Sadat's funeral. There was a hurricane fundraiser with all ex-presidents plus Trump via video.
Funerals and presidential library openings are the most common reasons for these meetings.

It is, in my view, a good development that he is not.
It would not have been at all shocking to find Trump -- and for that matter, Candace Owens -- on the side of Tom Cotton and Tomi Lahren instead.
That's what makes Trump's support, and that of some MAGA types, an interesting development worth exploring.
Yes, lots of conservatives are pro-reform. But many are not. And if anything, the pendulum among the Trumpiest conservatives has swung back in the law-and-order direction.

The daily press briefings, back when they were more or less daily, had become an exercise in reporters receiving non-answers to non-questions.
It also creates the need for multiple reporters to be seen by their bosses asking essentially the same question.
There is occasionally some value to watching the president/press secretary/executive branch official blatantly refuse/fail to answer a question, but it's usually outweighed by the performative aspect of the event. https://t.co/ph60nEkaSM
