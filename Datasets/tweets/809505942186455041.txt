The Trump Admin just unveiled new rules that would severely restrict birth control &amp; abortion access for countless women.

In Brett Kavanaugh, Senate Republicans have installed a wholly unfit justice to the #SCOTUS. This is a dark day for women, survivors of sexual assault, and our democracy. Read our statement: https://t.co/RaOJNtqXai
The Senate is expected to take a final vote on #BrettKavanaugh’s nomination later today. In these last hours, it's vital that we step up our efforts to speak out against this nominee who has proven himself to be unfit for #SCOTUS. We can't give up now; so much is at stake. https://t.co/GdyT8cGKuO
This vote should NOT be happening. Judge Kavanaugh has multiple assault allegations against him and he clearly does not have the judicial temperament to hold a lifetime seat on the highest court in the land. It’s time to stop this confirmation and #BelieveWomen. https://t.co/glu58Rdfjq

As @SenateGOP recklessly moves forward with #BrettKavanaugh's confirmation, a diverse and growing list of people and organizations are opposing his nomination, and for good reason. Here are some of them:
It's unconscionable that @SenateGOP is forging ahead with the final phase of the #KavanaughConfirmation. A man who violates a sworn oath to tell the truth cannot be trusted with a lifetime position of any sort, much less on #SCOTUS. https://t.co/Wg59o2QW9v

Make no mistake: @POTUS, @VP &amp; @SenateMajLdr will use Justice #AnthonyKennedy's retirement to further erode our most cherished #reprorights by appointing an #antichoice successor. The Senate must reject every nominee who refuses to uphold these freedoms: https://t.co/IMAPALN0ac
Doctors have an ethical obligation to provide accurate information to their patients. #NIFLAvBecerra will undermine that &amp; let crisis pregnancy centers deny women full information about their health. This will harm women &amp; undermine their constitutional rights. #EndtheLies
On the 53rd anniversary of #GriswoldvCT, access to #birthcontrol is under attack. We will continue to fight for comprehensive #reprohealth care for ALL and #ProtectTitleX. #ThanksGriswold
