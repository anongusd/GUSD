We hold voice of oppressed as leaders but we tend to implicate the power given to us by our voters in to political desires and fame than helping those who granted us power, thus why i live to celebrate Sankara as a strong young leader with great impact, arise youths. https://t.co/vkNgPPY2Dx

#NTVAkawungeeziUganda has much Revenue if collected appropriately to pay all sectors in  the government, so we don't need to borrow money to pay salaries but we  need to borrow to develop our country in various sectors like health  care etc not to pay salaries....
