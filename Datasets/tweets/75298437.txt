Federer's problem in #09 was del Potro. Serena's problem yesterday was Osaka. https://t.co/FK6ObDFG6q

The problem for the NBA is the overturned charge/block call. In real time (which is how games are called), it was a charge. Uh, the NFL changed its catch rule again because of the confusion brought to the call by replay. The NBA is hoping the focus remains on JR.

Chairman Dempsey said in a letter to Congress on August 19th that Syrian rebels wouldn't back US interests.
Should  the U-S clear the way, which side the "vetted opposition" or the rogue elements would win the race to Damascus?
If U-S doesn't strike in Syria, it will be in part because of the brutality exhibited by some in the opposition.

You need to know where the intel is coming from. Sources, if not methods, really matter here.
Don't remove your critical thinking cap when it comes to US action in Syria. Question closely those who favor a strike, especially the Prez.
@Ibishblog @Salman_Shaikh1 History will view any attack on Syria and its aftermath as President Obama's decision, not Secretary Kerry's.
Smart, Smart, Smart, Mr. President.
I asked in a number of interviews this week: "Shouldn't Congress be called back and put on the record on this?" Happy to see it's happening.
@Only4RM Because a peaceful protest movement for rights has become an armed revo/civil war w/many questionable actors. Hence the death toll.

@Only4RM Regime has avoided big, ghastly Hama type massacre that would trigger unified internat response, is happy to ground and pound opp.
@Squirrely99 Would that change the balance of power on battlefield? Would it change Assad's calculations? I don't know?
@Only4RM  What's the objective? What means achieve the objective? Is the objective likely to be achieved?
@shadihamid No good options sometimes actually means no good options.
Could Obama admit "the red line" remark was a mistake, back away from a strike, wait for Assad to overstep more dramatically then move?
@shadihamid A counter would be that Americans who do follow the ME would urge Obama to pause long and hard before doing anything.

Early observation on the first women's semi: Flipkens, if she has one, has to start topping that backhand. Has to get Bartoli off the court.
Predicting that US lawmakers will keep funds flowing to Egypt and Obama will be flogged for it. Congress should share the heat.

Consider what you've watching in Egypt right now and over the next month as you think about Syria. Syria is Egypt x100!
The political right in America would be wise to keep its powder dry for a few days.
The US withdrawing aid would further destabilize Egypt and might pose a real threat to Israel.
@Jonah_Blank @vali_nasr In my view, loophole will be found, likely Chief Justice as acting president.
US would have been informed of all negotiations btwn opposition, military and Morsi. What do you think of the stagecraft of announcement.
@Sonia_Dridi What's your take, SD?
President Morsi declaring temporary immunity of the presidency from judicial review on November 22, 2012, a mistake?
@jeanrosss Hey JR, in Doha monitoring Egypt coup.  You good?
How will regional players react, Saudi, Qatar. Qatar with billions in Egypt supporting Morsi government. What did they get for it? A coup?
Despite election wins, governing proved more difficult than standing in opposition for the MB. Saying no is easy, governing is hard!!!
MB's political wing won three elections in Egypt: presidential, parliamentary and constitutional referendum and now they are out?
Fuel shortages; crippling stagflation; failure to end the division in the country.
Consider for a second, are these missteps from Morsi? Taking back the executive power from the Supreme Council of Armed Forces, or SCAF?
Of most importance to the US in this transition is that the 1979 peace treaty btw Egypt and Israel not be threatened in any way.

@WTAtoday If so, take a break?  If so, let's get some reporting on it?
@WTAtoday The competition committee needs to have a long talk with Kerber.  Her performances in Dubai and Doha were pathetic.
Commentators in Dubai so surprised by the listless performance of AKerber in the Vinci match.  Didn't they watch her last match in Doha?
@TennisTV Adds to tv broadcast.  Don't see it much among women at the very top of the game.  It could be a competivie disadvantage for them.
Serena needs to improve movement to continue to dominate the matches against Vika.  If she does, she dominates. If not, it's a seesaw.
Here are my thoughts:  It's all on Serena's side.  She is the better athlete with better weapons - serve and forehand.

All credit to Stephens for not letting her off the hook.
Serena complicated that match in the same way she complicated the Wimbledon final's 2nd set before coming back in the 3rd.
Much will be said about Serena's injury, but that would miss the point:  Serena lost control of match after 2-0 up in 2nd set.

@DylanByers @politico Not sure why you bothered.
I'm sure how you debate someone who will say anything and ultimately say, "I never said that."
Romney said he would reduce income tax rates without adding to the deficit. Economists say Romney has yet to explain how he would do it.
I wonder if Prez had Turkey and Syria on his mind tonight?  The world doesn't stop churning, even for a debate on the US economy.
Final analysis from me:  Good debate for Romney, no idea what he would do as president.

Not a single question on the Sunday news programs about the republican ticket and foreign policy.  Foreign policy impacts domestic policy.
@thehill The seeds of over-confidence.
@amikegreen2 Done!  This work is vital!

@thehill The answer should be "no" until you agree to something on the revenue side.
@richard_parr @RahulP_Sport Not necessary in my book.  Federer one, Laver two - open/shut.  But it's clear #Federer really wants it.
@RahulP_Sport @richard_parr You know how I "roll", RP.  #Federer all the way to a gilded Wimbledon!  Ok, that's better.
@reetstweets Right?  I mean, that was a gift.  Credit to Murray for hitting the ball back, but that's all he did.

@Slony53 So If you're a US media outlet covering the election cycle, you're either a partisan or accused of being a partisan?  Is that it?
@thehill @AlexanderBolton Yeah, right.
@Dingersdad13 I have always shared your view, but I've never won that argument... in any newsroom anywhere.
Is anyone, anywhere in the world reading what they consider really solid, non-partisan reporting on the US election?
Love the Monday Morning quarterbacking of Tiger.  What will they write about when he's done.
I love how the guy who's won 14 majors is a dunce for sticking with his plan and the guy who's won four is brilliant for winning Sunday.
Who said this: I don't think he'll ever play as well as he did three or four years ago...it's difficult to see him climbing back to No. 1.
@PetrouchkaNYC That's a deal!
@PetrouchkaNYC Whoa...  One more day in the great city.  Will have to give it a try the next time I'm here!
What nonsense; this from a golf blogger on cbssportsline:  Is it time to start considering Tiger Woods will never win another major?
Look out for Christopher Froome. That dude may have to leave Sky to win!  Whatcha' think?

About a month ago, Politico had us reading a profile of an anchor for a weekend instead of doing some real reporting... Oh, please.

@mckaycnn was just handlin' his business. Dude, watching you from Paris!  I enjoyed the show.
On the ground in Paris.  This is gonna' be fun!  Where should we go?  What should we see?
One more AJE newscast and the Harris men are off to Paris!  Any suggestions?
Game on!  Watching all of the Romney interviews now!
It looks like someone's found their voice.  And it looks like it's put repubs on the back foot.
"if his premise is 'I'm Mr. Fix-it on the economy because I made a lot of money, I think it's entirely appropriate to look at that record."
How many of you are happy to see Obama toughen and sharpen his attacks on Romney's finances?  I'm not used to hearing Repubs so defensive.
I'm sure Romney has no idea how many news organizations around the world are looking into this.
I'm afraid Romney is in real trouble over Bain and his finances. This is gonna' get really ugly and he'll only have himself to blame.
Well done, Mr. Shelton.  Way to beat O'Reilly at his game.  Too bad these shows are about rhetoric and not arguments.  http://t.co/krgvnTdp

Has anyone read a really good article on #Federer's win?  I've been disappointed by the writing so far.  Looking for praise of both guys.
With this win, #Federer took all the pressure off himself at the Olympics.  Best two of three or three of five at Olympics?

@RFedererNews Roof open, closed, it doesn't matter.  These two are so into it now, they'd play it in the Doha sandpit!
Happy to see Fed's service % going up.  He'll need more out of the wide serve to the ad court for an easier time of it.
I always favor the aggressive player, so I pick Federer moving forward.  Unforced errors don't concern me.  You'll make more coming forward.
My thoughts on the match:  Never seen Murray play such a clean match.  Never!  Only Federer's belief system kept him in the match.
@KingJames @andy_murray Come on LBJ, you gotta' love THE GOAT?!  So disappointed you're rooting for Murray.  I get the whole Man U thing.

Serena has all the tools to go straight Azarenka on Radwanska.  It's time to get out of your man-made quicksand and move!
@jon_wertheim That 2nd set was a gift from Serena.
Serena just turned a routine 6-1 6-3 match into a real dog fight.  That 2nd set was painful to watch.
