Psychological manipulation is the exercise of undue influence through mental distortion and emotional exploitation, with the intention to seize power, control, benefits, and privileges at the victim’s expense.
Leadership is not individually while people values money not others.
Manipulation is commonly used aggressively, as a way to harm the manipulator’s target, or at least to benefit the manipulator at the target’s expense.
The value or worth of a man is, as of all other things, his price—that is to say, so much as would be given for the use of his power—and therefore is not absolute but a thing dependent on the need and judgment of another.
Our fundamental moral obligation, then,is to respect persons; morally right actions are thus those that express respect 4 persons as ends in themselves, while morally wrong actions are those that express disrespect or contempt for persons by not valuing them as ends in themselves
To be a person is to have a status and worth that is unlike that of any other kind of being: it is to be an end in itself with dignity. And the only response that is appropriate to such a being is respect.
A manipulator is more of reasons than logical justifiers but as causal levers.The manipulator, reasons are tools,and bad reasons can work as well as, or better than, a good one.	It is the Game of politicians.	Dr. Robert Mutie(Lawyer)CEO-CLSI @UKenyatta @skmusyoka

If a goldsmith held, say, 100 pounds of other people's gold in his vaults, he could issue banknotes to the value of 1000 pounds. As long as no more than 10 percent of the holders of those notes wanted their gold at any one time, no one would realize the fraud being perpetrated. https://t.co/Q4RwkVn3Ev
It was found that, for every unit of gold held by the goldsmith, ten times the sum could be safely issued as notes without anyone usually becoming any the wiser. https://t.co/IkIfe95rua
By giving these receipts to people seeking capital, in the form of loans, the goldsmiths could use the money deposited with them by others to make money for themselves. https://t.co/ofvCjkcTk0
The goldsmiths, now fledgling bankers, noticed that at any one time only a small proportion of the gold held with them was being withdrawn. So they hit upon the idea of issuing more of the receipt notes themselves, notes that did not refer to any actual deposited wealth. https://t.co/JUCxJO75A5
notes that did not refer to any actual deposited wealth. https://t.co/ZBsSkxGrBL

As this was a time-consuming process, it became common practice for people to simply exchange smiths' receipts when conducting financial transactions. As time passed, the goldsmiths began to issue receipts for specific values of gold, making buying and selling easier still. https://t.co/8a6m4yCZ7y
The goldsmith would issue a receipt for the deposit and, to undertake financial transactions, the buyer would withdraw his gold and give it to the seller, who would then deposit it again, frequently with the same goldsmith. https://t.co/44OF9rzYZP

The Bad Thing is to Compete with a fool.
Because the ownership in land is a very specific thing, requiring precise and proper transfers of ownership, it used to be that people always required a certified abstract be provided with a deed to ensure the deed was not merely a color of title fiction. https://t.co/BaNtyaK545
Thus, the chain of title from the land patent to the present may include many deeds. The actual title remains with the land patent and lawful deeds show the chain of title to the present landowner. https://t.co/iKB5htf8i7
The courts have ruled that deeds are mere color of title; the actual title to land is secured with an irrefutable instrument, like a land patent. When that land is subsequently conveyed to another owner by a deed, the deed colors the title to show the new owner. https://t.co/Rvt5G4gAy8
SOLVE THIS TROUBLE IN KENYA:	Color of title,in property law, refers to a claim to title that appears valid but may be legally defective. Color of title may arise if there is evidence, such as a writing, suggesting valid legal title. @Faridakaroney @maswazuri
Color of office" refers to an act usually committed by a public official under the appearance of authority but exceeds such authority. An affirmative act or omission, committed under color of office, is sometimes required to prove malfeasance in office. @UKenyatta

The importance of this decision is emphasized by the fact that our continent is annually losing more than $50 billion through illicit financial outflows. https://t.co/vk1oc3uAP1
We must focus on the matter of illicit financial outflows from Africa, and specifically on the steps that must be taken to radically reduce these outflows to ensure that these development resources remain within the continent. https://t.co/Czrrze7InE
In the light of this analysis, it is clear that Africa is a net creditor to the rest of the world, even though, despite the inflow of official development assistance, the continent had suffered and was continuing to suffer from a	crisis of insufficient resources for development. https://t.co/JCUqVN3vQJ

Corruption is prevalent thrghout the continent.

It seems to me that liberal rule of law has always been confronted by these two varieties of « politics as war »: the an-archic and irreligious one represented by Foucault, and the arch-archic and religious one represented by Schmitt https://t.co/LONJW0S2sE
order results from a divine revelation that commands absolute authority over the individual. Prior to any rule of law there is a politics of obedience to divine commands, which are the ultimate ground of authentic, non-relativistic morality. https://t.co/3t9SXQ6pOf
Schmitt is interested in thematizing the pre-legal character of the difference between order and disorder because for him, ultimately, the instance of order that makes possible any legal system has an inevitable theological component: https://t.co/PPQ6sQtwdZ
For Schmitt, at the other end, the practice of domination is contrasted by what he calls the « authoritative command. » https://t.co/g3sZT5DlVX
Foucault is interested in the pre-legal establishment of order bcs he wants 2identify a space for a politics of resistance&amp;an ethics of pleasure,both of which cannot occur within the rule of law,bcs this rule legitimizes domination but cannot express the desire not to be governed https://t.co/3yElEpA6WR
This is the place to remark on the first crucial difference between Foucault and Schmitt. For Foucault, what falls outside of the practice of domination is the practice of « not being governed. https://t.co/3tSANbFrLv
but rather describe the opposition between the practice of rule or domination as such (whether legitimate or illegitimate) and what falls outside of this practice. https://t.co/qttCpdMGJa
In the Western tradition,it is the oppositions of domination&amp; resistance, slavery and freedom, that are at once political and war-like. These oppositions are at once pre-legal and political because they do not specify the difference between legitimate&amp;illegitimate modes of rule, https://t.co/mhIUtjhbvZ
The formula « politics as war » indicates that the marking of the difference between order and disorder is not a normative operation but a strategic one, in the sense that it is an operation of war which is intrinsically political. https://t.co/d8Moe5WsEn
Foucault and Schmitt both accept the following premise: No law can be applied in a chaos, because chaos is defined as a situation of exception to any law. If a law is to apply, a difference between order and disorder must be already marked in a pre- and infra-legal fashion. https://t.co/lVRNeBh0z5
That is why when Foucault and Schmitt reverse Clausewitz, they wish to thematize the pre-legal situation from which emerges the rule of law and, in general, every legitimate form of domination. 	What is this « situation » that precedes all forms of legitimate rule? https://t.co/xkipwzEjTK
On the contrary, the formula « politics as war » is intended to draw attention to the ways in which political and legal forms emerge in the first place. Although war may be conducted according to certain rules, in no sense can one say that it falls under the rule of law. https://t.co/S8pMRHzEwK
Liberalism tends to subsume politics under law. The formula « politics as war » stands for a rejection of this juridification of politics. War is policy pursued by other means, war is an activity that carries out the policies of the state and thus presupposes its existence.. https://t.co/TsBF5P92ZZ
The aporia of the rule of law&amp;the new sense of democracy	It is generally accepted that the liberal conception of civil society is wedded to the ideal of the rule of law:a subject becomes political only insofar as it hs bn previously legally constituted as such a political subject https://t.co/zCj7WLlA41
I shall discuss a couple of ways in which this striking, perhaps shocking formula brings out certain aporias that the liberal understanding of politics constantly encounters, and that require a rethinking of both democracy and orthodoxy--- https://t.co/zezyzsHnn7
The formula « politics is war » is central to the thought of two important critics of liberalism who are not usually treated together: Michel Foucault and Carl Schmitt. https://t.co/M3INM2I8yf
These varied reactions to the liberal ideal of politics seem to indicate that the « war » against which liberalism fights is not as such anti-political, but rather expresses another understanding of politics, that of politics as war. https://t.co/4RAM2xxUGg
In the last decades alone an ongoing « culture war » has taken place in which the liberal understanding of culture and identity has been contested from both the Left and the Right, giving rise to different forms of « identity politics » and « multiculturalism. https://t.co/o8leCTPfmE
Similarly, one does not need to appeal to other, supposedly antagonistic « civilizations » to realize that the liberal idea of what it means to have a « culture » or « civilization » has been repeatedly called into question within our tradition. https://t.co/v3IFCKxQxO
And yet one need not look beyond Western tradition to see that repeatedly during the modern age orthodox movements hv latched on to the democratic aspirations of peoples, as if to indicate an old&amp;secret affinity between the political expressions of the vox populi and the vox Dei. https://t.co/BtYil1irrO
– a separation and subjection that orthodoxy rejects. Likewise, liberalism opposes democracy because its ideal of civil society requires that government be exercised in and through the rule of law, and never directly by the people to whom those laws are addressed. https://t.co/oGq7R3NYl7
From its origin, just as nowadays, liberalism identifies two main sources(foyers)of war: the first is orthodoxy, the second is democracy. Liberalism opposes orthodoxy because it upholds the separation and subjection of religion to politics, of church to state- https://t.co/a8t285t3ZT

The GFI report finds that increasingly large net outflows have caused economic growth rates in developing countries to decline, and are directly responsible for falling living standards. https://t.co/WZnzbfQWOq

It is said that without greed we would still be living in caves but, left unchecked, the insatiable desire for more and better material things can be destructive. @UKenyatta uhuru
Sadly, all those expenses hv to be paid, &amp;it can lead to crippling credit card debt,loans that cannot be paid back, and the eventual loss of everything to pay back creditors- the things u own end up owning u. So,be very wary of greed. Happiness from those items is fleeting anyway https://t.co/gJDNjuGfVu
Greedy- 	Not content with their lot in life,some people look at all those things they cld hv that make life even better.Or so they think,anyway. The latest smartphone.The upgraded car. The bigger house. The 80 inch flat screen TV.The huge deck, patio. The yacht. @antonioguterres
But although Ebenezer Scrooge and his ilk are portrayed as misers with serious money, greed can sometimes make you poor.. @realDonaldTrump rea https://t.co/PZf6134Pqr
Greed is a particularly ugly sin. While there are positive characteristics of pride, or even envy, it’s almost impossible to use greed in any way that isn’t an insult. It conjures images of fat cat CEOs hoarding millions, while their workers earn minimum wage. @antonioguterres
Think about it: If enough people make a small gesture for someone else every day, we could transform the world. Do you spend more time giving or taking? https://t.co/3GtXleF9zB
We idolize people who drive expensive cars, wear the latest fashions, and live in luxurious homes. Greedy or not, we all help perpetuate the addiction. When do we ever stress the importance and value of generosity over material wealth? @antonioguterres anto @realDonaldTrump rea
We are such a competitive society. We measure success by finishing in first place, making it to the top of our game, and having better toys than our neighbors. We value instant gratification by encouraging people to consume rather than to save for a rainy day. https://t.co/Evj02VIia0
Greedy people borrow to fund their buying addiction&amp;stick others with the bill. Rather than taking the easy way out, parents, political leaders, executives, &amp;the rest of us have a moral responsibility to provide a legacy for those who follow. @antonioguterres  @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump real https://t.co/CzRvmmyDej
Borrowing from the future. Greedy people care about their needs today and kick problems down the road. They put band-aids on problems rather than solving the root cause; they buy things that benefit their organization today rather than investing in its future; @antonioguterres
Greedy people have the ability to suck the oxygen right out of a room. https://t.co/QMfR1xlDJf
Robbing someone’s confidence. Some people bring out the best in others while selfish people focus on themselves. Greedy people make themselves feel better by tearing down other people rather than by helping others feel good about themselves. @antonioguterres @realDonaldTrump
Examples include companies that incorporate in the Cayman Islands to avoid paying taxes and politicians who waste hard-earned taxpayer money by conducting “official business” at resort destinations. @realDonaldTrump real https://t.co/2khDUbfr2i
Gaming the system.Greedy people look 4 clever ways or loopholes to outsmart rules&amp;regulations,designed to protect the system,4personal gain.Although their actions may be entirely legal,greedy people evade their responsibilities by offloading the costs to others. @antonioguterres
here’s only so much to go around. They feel they deserve a larger piece, even at someone else’s expense, and they’re going to take it. https://t.co/r0IYSsS8t2
Something for nothing. Greedy people are first in line to ask for more but last in line to make the effort required to earn the rewards. Instead of adopting the view that everyone benefits as the pie gets larger, they view the pie as a constant — @antonioguterres @realDonaldTrump

Brexit without a deal will disrupt the balance of power in the EU, thus strengthening Germany’s dominance. Even if Britain leaves with no deal or with a negotiated settlement,Britain must be involved in EU like security&amp;defense—which wld be impossible under no deal. @theresa_may
No deal would have immediate but much less serious consequences for the EU. On average, EU member states do about 8 percent of their trade with Britain, compared with Britain’s 44 percent with the EU. @theresa_may there
A No-deal Brexit wld also create huge uncertainty over the legal status of the 3million EU citizens living in the UK.The end of free movement of labor wld lead to a sharp fall in the number of people coming to work in Britain from EU counties,slowing economic growth @theresa_may
Honda estimates that tariffs would push up the cost of a U.K.-built car by 10 percent. And British exports would face EU tariffs. @theresa_may theres
Much more the Bank of England It may opt for the latter, betting that the inflationary surge resulting from a weaker currency will prove short-lived. But it would at the very least face a difficult trade-off. @theresa_may ther
The Bank of England cld then face a choice btwn raising interest rates to defend the value of the pound&amp;head off a surge in inflation&amp;keeping interest rates low in an attempt to shore up economic activity. @theresa_may there
Faced with such economic turmoil, the British pound would fall steeply, probably taking the currency below parity against the euro and to 40-year lows against the U.S. dollar, immediately pushing up inflation and reducing living standards. @theresa_may ther
