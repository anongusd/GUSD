Indiana has been fortunate &amp; has not had any cases reported this year, but #Hoosiers still run the risk of being exposed to such a disease. Measles vaccines have saved more than 20 million lives throughout the world since 2000.
Measles is a highly contagious, airborne virus that can lead to serious respiratory illnesses &amp; can become life-threatening.  Just this year, there have been reports of 127 individual measles cases throughout 10 states.

I support the President’s national emergency declaration designed to strengthen our borders with additional border barrier systems as quickly and efficiently as possible.
There are already over 650 miles of barriers in place at the southern border. Apprehensions of people trying to illegally enter our country at these barrier locations have gone down dramatically.
Strong borders must be in place in order to keep the American people safe and the situation at our southern border can no longer be ignored.
While this is a humanitarian crisis that must be handled with compassion, this ongoing problem is overwhelming our resources to adequately address thousands upon thousands of people, particularly of children, who are coming to our border.
As I witnessed during my trip to the Texas border last year, we are seeing floods of families and unaccompanied children reaching our southern border in an attempt to illegally enter the Unites States.
The resolution the House passed today to end the President’s national emergency declaration undermines the statutory powers granted by Congress to the President to declare national emergencies.
Congress gave the President statutory authority to declare national emergencies. When Congress did so, they did not specifically define what can be designated as a ‘national emergency’ or not.

This package works to improve our communities by improving our nation’s transportation infrastructure &amp; ensuring rural areas have access to the same basic utilities that urban areas have through expanded deployment in #ruralbroadband.
It continues to ensure safe &amp; healthy food on the tables of American families &amp; funds federal crop insurance programs that provide much needed stability to #Hoosier farmers.
With this agreement, federal workers are provided the security they deserve in knowing they will get paid on time &amp; receive a 1.9% pay raise.
What Congress passed today is more than just border security.
This deal increases the number of immigration judges so we can reduce the troubling case backlog. It builds safer communities by including resources for state/local law enforcement to address the #opioidcrisis, close sexual assault kit backlogs &amp; hire more police officers.
It further combats terrorists, espionage, drug traffickers, gangs &amp; violent criminals by increasing funding for U.S. Attorneys; U.S. Marshals; Drug Enforcement Administration; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms &amp; Explosives; &amp; the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
This package provides over $22 billion for improved border security, including physical barriers, needed equipment, technology &amp; personnel to keep our country safe.
It is government’s job to work together to fund the government &amp; I am proud we were able make progress &amp; find a #bipartisan compromise that keeps government open &amp; provides necessary funding to better secure our southern border.

While our work is not done, this is an important step to make lasting changes to improve accountability &amp; transparency in Congress.
I am pleased we have made much-needed improvements to the way Congress combats &amp; responds to sexual harassment &amp; retaliation in the House &amp; Senate. Importantly, this bill guarantees taxpayer dollars will no longer be spent to settle sexual harassment or retaliation claims.
By passing the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act (#CAARA), Congress is working to ensure all employees have a safe workplace environment where allegations of wrongdoings are investigated in a swifter, fairer &amp; more efficient manner.

This bill makes it easier for #veterans to use the opportunities that licensing, certification &amp; national tests provide to advance &amp; enhance their education, &amp; to build a career. To learn more about the #VeteransTESTAct, click here &gt;&gt; https://t.co/QqqTAM8eHH
The Veterans TEST Accessibility Act ensures our #veterans are prepared for a wide variety of career paths upon returning home from deployment by making it easier to enhance their education, build a career &amp; provide a better life not only for themselves but for their families.
The Veterans TEST Accessibility Act provides our #veterans simpler, fairer access to tests, like the SAT &amp; certifications, like certifications for mechanics, firefighters &amp; realtors, so they can compete in today’s job market after serving our country
Veterans should always have access to the education benefits they've earned. I introduced the #VeteransTESTAct, which was signed into law as part of the #ForeverGIBill, giving #veterans simpler &amp; fairer access to tests &amp; certifications so they can compete in today’s job market.
🇺🇸 One Year Ago Today: The #ForeverGIBill was signed into law. 	There are over a half million #veterans in Indiana. They must be properly compensated &amp; cared for, &amp; that includes guaranteeing access to important benefits &amp; services that support assimilation into civilian life.

I'd like to thank @RepAnnaEshoo &amp; my colleagues at @HouseCommerce for their attention to this issue. I cannot emphasize enough how critically important it is to reauthorize #PAHPA before it expires at the end of September.
#PAHPA ensures more #heathcare professionals like nurses/doctors can be hired/trained when facing a #publichealth crisis. It ensures we have a robust supply of vaccines, equipment like gloves, hazmat suits, masks etc in our Strategic National Stockpiles located across the country
To ensure we're better prepared when facing an outbreak like Zika or Ebola, #PAHPA improves the existing Emergency Response Fund so the Secretary doesn't have to wait on approval from Congress to immediately fund the response measures needed to counteract an outbreak &amp; save lives
Our bill reflects extensive feedback from the full range of medical &amp; public health preparedness and response stakeholders. You can see the list here &gt;&gt; https://t.co/xa9lJZSU32
This bipartisan #publichealth &amp; #nationalsecurity effort will ensure our nation is better prepared to respond to natural disasters, emerging infectious diseases, &amp; chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attacks whether from terrorist groups or from nation states.

The Jake Laird Act is named after an Indianapolis police officer who was shot &amp; killed in 2004 in the line of duty by a man who struggled with mental illness. This bill provides grants to encourage states to adopt laws, similar to Indiana’s 2005 Jake Laird Law.
As our country continues to grapple w/how to keep our communities safe, the Jake Laird Act will provide our local law enforcement officers the tools &amp; training necessary to prevent senseless acts of violence from claiming more innocent lives.

Opioids are powerful drugs &amp; have the potential to become incredibly addictive. It's imperative our nation’s prescribers receive adequate training before sending a patient home w/a bottle full of pills that could be abused. That's why @RepSchneider &amp; I introduced the ADAPT Act.

✅The Senate passed the Kennedy-King Establishment Act yesterday &amp; now it's on the way to the President's desk! Learn more from @rtv6 &gt;&gt; https://t.co/AS1kVBl8oU
I'm proud to introduce a bill that will help those who find themselves in an emergency situation by enhancing the centers within the National Poison Data System that offer free, confidential, expert medical advice 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. &gt;&gt; https://t.co/ME2oBle58y
Poison control centers save countless lives, prevent toxic exposure &amp; poisoning injury, and reduce billions of dollars in unnecessary #healthcare costs. The data poison centers collect can even be used to identify hotspots for opioid misuse &amp; overdose.
In one month alone, there were 9,039 #opioid exposures reported to poison control centers nationwide.
Since 2011, poison control centers have been working #behindthescenes to fight against the #opioidepidemic &amp; have handled about 500,000 cases of opioid misuse &amp; abuse – that’s approximately 192 cases per day, every day.
This week, I joined @RepEliotEngel @RepJoeBarton &amp; @RepDianaDeGette to introduce H.R.5329, the Poison Center Network Enhancement Act. This #bipartisan bill reauthorizes funding for the poison control center's toll-free number &gt;&gt; https://t.co/ME2oBle58y
As a member of @HouseCommerce #SubHealth, we just wrapped-up a 2 day hearing focusing on combating the #opioid crisis w/prevention &amp; #publichealth solutions. Part of the conversation included focusing on how poison control centers are already on the front lines of this crisis.

This Task Force deserves national attention and should be used as a model to target the opioid crisis in other communities across the country. It is an example of how we can come together to help others turn their lives around and end this tragic opioid epidemic.
Heartbreaking statistic: According to the @CDCgov, opioids killed more than 42,000 people in 2016, more than any year on record.
Last year, @POTUS declared the #opioidcrisis a nationwide public health emergency and earlier this month, the President extended that designation. https://t.co/U3kimitLFy
@POTUS has prioritized combating the opioid and heroin epidemic with the establishment of his Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis &gt;&gt; https://t.co/Ya7rR2LEut
The Task Force unites members of the medical community, to members of the #education and #lawenforcement communities, in order to discuss and implement best practices to combat the #opioidepidemic on all fronts.
Due to Ann Vermilion’s leadership in the Task Force as well as work of the medical professionals in Grant County, written prescriptions for opioid medications have significantly declined in Grant County.
Grant County’s Opioid and Substance Abuse Task Force, which has been in existence since 2014, is working hard to put an end to the devastating #opioid and heroin epidemic that is taking the lives of too many Hoosiers.
Indiana is 1 of 4 states where the drug overdose mortality rate has quadrupled since 1999. In 2015, there were 529 drug overdose deaths involving an opioid in the #Hoosier state alone.
Meet my guest for #SOTU, #IN05 Ann Vermilion, Chair of the Grant Co. Opioid &amp; Substance Abuse Task Force.

Andrew from @VisitIndy contacted me asking that we craft a tax plan that helps the middle class. This bill does that.

I applaud @POTUS' dedication to supporting the Jewish State and its people, and believe relocating the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem would further promote peace and stability in Israel.
Jerusalem has long been the home to Israel’s seat of government, and today’s declaration only reaffirms the United States’ commitment to supporting this successful democracy and our closest ally in the Middle East.
It directs federal funding to make sure domestic violence records are accurately reported to the @FBI
Today I voted to fix the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The #FixNICS Act is #bipartisan &amp; ensures federal &amp; state authorities enforce existing law to report criminal history records to the NICS. There is no excuse for negligence- it's costing lives.
The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 does not arm criminals. If someone is a criminal who is prohibited from purchasing or possessing a firearm, nothing in the bill would allow that person to purchase or possess a firearm.
The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 is about safety. It ensures law-abiding citizens who are qualified to carry concealed firearms in 1 state can also carry in other states that allow residents to do so. #2A

It takes a special person to dedicate themselves to a career in law enforcement. There is no higher calling.
Our panel agrees: Although there's been a decrease in candidates interested in law enforcement careers, these jobs are rewarding.
A thorough background check is required for many of these jobs. Your actions could close doors that you didn't even know you wanted to open!
Critical skills for Sheriff's department employees? Communication skills are key. Prefer candidates have some college or military experience
U.S. Attorney Minkler says there's often a gap when people haven't learned about losing and how to overcome challenges &amp; setbacks.
What does it take to be a U.S. Attorney or to work for one?Need to be able to collaborate, lead, be part of team and handle adversity.
What does it take to be a prosecutor? Strong writing and grammar skills, professionalism, read a lot, and a record of volunteering. https://t.co/w69C5bq4YY

Our panelists agree: the best gift you can give to your students is the gift of language.
Our courts need bilingual employees, esp. attorneys &amp; bailiffs. Candidates should be fluent in language &amp; culture to better serve people. https://t.co/UqpMwtfqTR

Lots of opps for educators to bring local, state &amp; federal gov speakers to talk careers w/ students. Kids can also shadow current employees.
Panelists agree: Public service allows employees to give back, to solve problems for their community &amp; to work on important issues early on.
Other jobs they're looking for in @FishersIN gov are focused on information security; need more systems analysts and cyber security pros.
1/3 of @INSPD IN State employees are millennials. Jobs in state government allow employees to explore the state &amp; lots of job opportunities.
In 10 yrs, @INSPD anticipates more IT &amp; tech jobs. Still need people to help build roads &amp; care for kids. @IndianaDCS @FSSAIndiana @INDOT
Federal workforce anticipates fewer administrative jobs - more technology and data roles in the future.
Apprenticeship programs are needed to help candidates meet the demands &amp; develop skills needed for jobs in government @FishersIN.
.@FishersIN believes that keys to successful candidates are an entrepreneurial spirit &amp; adopting new technologies to serve constituents.
Ashley Elroy of @FishersIN says greatest job needs for the city are entry level, general maintenance, superintendents for road construction. https://t.co/IduBSGJvf6
Dan Stevens, director of admin for @HamiltonCoIN commissioners-need effective communicators, problem solvers w/ good writing skills. https://t.co/OS59Tgy8vp

How can students learn more about these careers in high school? @boonecosheriff &amp; @FishersFireDept have ride along programs.
Both @IMPDnews &amp; @Fishers_Police look for officers who have Spanish &amp; Asian language skills &amp; who understand more than one dialect.
All our panelists agree the language skills are critical - there's no time to find a translator in an emergency or crisis situation.
The @FBI often requires a college or advanced degree for prospective candidates. https://t.co/p7A7ligFvD
Students must prepare for the physical fitness requirements of these jobs. A lack of flexibility is often what disqualifies candidates.
Our panel: Decisions that students make today impact their eligibility for careers in law enforcement &amp; public safety. Make good choices!
Special Agent Osborn says @FBI  was 11% women 24 years ago &amp; 20% women today. Need candidates from lots of different backgrounds.
All of our panelists agree that students interested in law enforcement &amp; public safety need a "true heart for service" to be successful.
.@FishersFireDept asks teachers to help students develop values, resolve conflicts, identify what drives them &amp; what their purpose is.
Biggest challenge for @IMPDnews? Invest in new hires and find &amp; keep candidates with a background in technology.
To be a paramedic, students need special training &amp; to be at least 21 yrs old. Most importantly, need to be ready for hard work &amp; sacrifice.
What is @FishersFireDept looking for? Paramedics - 70-80% of calls they get are medical in nature.
.@boonecosheriff Major Tony Harris says they are looking for 24 more people this year. Entry level jobs are often in corrections divison. https://t.co/y9v2qPdpIk

This is what #Medicaid "per capita allotment" means: https://t.co/xxHA45Qgzk
"Continuous coverage means encouraging &amp; incentivizing personal responsibility in healthcare." @HouseCommerce https://t.co/oRjO4wnjGI
If more people buy into the healthcare system b4 they need care, coverage is more affordable for all. That's why continuous coverage works. https://t.co/mD2qlFjDtK
#ContinuousCoverage is a priority within the #AHCA https://t.co/vMPrgZpif8
Market stabilization is essential to a functioning #healthcare system that gets people back in control of their healthcare decisions
Keeping health insurance is just as important to me as having access &amp; getting #healthcare
#Medicaid under the #AHCA will focus on the most vulnerable: the elderly, people with disabilities, children, &amp; pregnant mothers

#AHCA will change this: We want to make it easier for families like this one to get &amp; keep coverage that works for them &amp; fits their budget
They’ve changed doctors every year because they are forced to go with the coverage they can afford- not what works best for them.
”The bottom line is we can no longer afford healthcare.”
Their income has not, &amp; now, she shared, “Our choices for #healthcare are very limited and extremely costly.”
Every year since the #ACA was enacted, their health costs have increased by as much as 20%
A constituent of mine is self-employed with 2 young adult kids, 1 still in college.
RT @SpeakerRyan: Open, transparent process: before final vote, our #RepealAndReplace bill will go through 4 committees. https://t.co/5Si6xp…
