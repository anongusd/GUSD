@Barbi__P @JackRottie @Newsweek I am too. What you posted nails it. The GOP is looking to erode and eventually destroy what we call democracy. This erosion begins with their hypocritical stance of caring for the child inside the womb. It is a lie. We are under attack.
@maureenqw @anneapplebaum It was on his mind because he saw the danger our democracy is in. 		We are in the hands of a Russian asset and a complicit GOP. 		Our country is in big trouble and Dingall knew and kept warning us up until his death.

@JackRottie @Newsweek Absolutely. They will start by getting rid of Roe v Wade and move to the pill. 		Their misogyny is deeply tied to the idea that white women need to breed and stay in the home. A wonderful thing if that is a choice but not if it is forced upon us. 		I am deeply worried.
@Sarah_SKG_1983 @realDonaldTrump Trump is getting something out of it and by extension his Russian, Saudi handlers. You can be sure of three things...		1.  It will harm our democracy		2.  It will harm our relationship with our allies		3.  It makes the world an even more dangerous place.
Am√©rica has a Russian asset in the WH. He is a rapist, a pedophile, a mobster in every sense of the word and he is destroying our country. 		A single president?  PLEASE. https://t.co/fauoEkQJzz
@Newsweek The overturning of Roe v Wade is not a speculation.  This will happen. 		The GOP wants a white Christian America. A woman having a right to her body is contrary to this goal. Diversity and inclusiveness is alien to this model. It is just a matter of time. We need to impeach NOW.
@blakehounshell Yes, we will soon be hearing that Trump speaks to dolphins and does not have an a**hole. 		This is more authoritarian propaganda. 		We are in a fast living the beginning of an authoritarian state. Trump is not an idiot, he is a dangerous mobster.
@mmpadellan @realDonaldTrump I always ask myself, what is Trump getting out of it and by extension Putin.  However this plays out, it will not be good for this country.

@FreeGirlNowNYC @lulu_says2 @ddale8 It was noteworthy as it is clear he does not care who he hurts with the shutdown and is probably getting a bit of a power surge knowing he can affect so many peoples‚Äô lives. Feeds into his desire to be more like his evil authoritarian strong men he so admires.

@Carolyny1948 @resistfascism1 @rouleau_karen @sarahkendzior That it good to hear. Getting attention is good, however, that should not be the only goal. We must get the mobsters in the WH.
