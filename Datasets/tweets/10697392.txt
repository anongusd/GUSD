Anyway if you‚Äôre looking for historical analogues as the Trump/Russia investigation unfolds - I highly recommend Bagman!
Elliot Richardson was Nixon‚Äôs AG and the day‚Äôs Robert Mueller. A man of unimpeachable character and ethics, he was a profile in courage in standing up to Agnew. Richardson walled the WH off and kept partisanship out of the process, letting investigators do their work.
The #Bagman podcast narrated by Rachel Maddow is something else. I‚Äôd read about Watergate, but knew little on Spiro Agnew. There was a criminal in the WH, who extorted, and rallied the GOP base against the media, attacked the integrity of the investigation as a witch hunt. https://t.co/6pEKjcPXn2

Congress has been clear in its authority to write laws, w/the Posse Comitatus Act &amp; codified right to claim asylum regardless of method of entry or immigration status. Trump cannot make new laws himself. There is no nat‚Äôl emergency if one looks at historical border apprehensions.

I am not for open borders but they should be treated humanely. They are human beings. Why not work with the countries they came from, so they have reason to stay - we used to do that. They are fleeing violence and poverty and will keep leaving in droves.
Especially now that people are seeing how many of their countrymen are leaving. Are their countries supposed to stop them? We used to criticize totalitarian behavior.
We get way less than that now, and most of these people claim asylum. They turn themselves in. The US has international obligations to treat those claims fairly at least. Those in the caravan who do reach the US will present themselves to border patrol.

@TrueFactsStated Trump treating foreign policy like a real estate transaction. Human life not worth billions in arms deals - neither a US perm resident, nor the lives of Saudis who speak out, nor Yemeni civilians. Trump not even pretending human rights matter. MBS will escalate the death grip.
@TrueFactsStated He‚Äôs telling MBS it‚Äôs ok to step up war of bullying murdering dissent into silence. MBS went berzerk over tweet from Canada about human rights violations.
