Everything is left to ones interpretation. Doesn’t make it right
@andreathekline @shannonrwatts You’re making the case for why they felt the need to spell it out for people. Impeachment is political in nature. What you do on your own time is one thing and being on government property is another.
@dean_argiris @shannonrwatts Impeachment is of a political nature, so for people who may try to blur the lines is probably why they issued a direct statement.
@shannonrwatts Having that type of discussion in the workplace  would violate the Hatch Act which is already in place.

@ceprdc provides great data on labor and people of color on how collective bargaining has helped all workers, one voice #EOhellNO
Black workers are more likely than workers of any other race or ethnicity to be unionized. Being apart of a union allows us to have access to healthcare, retirement benefits and fair wages. They don’t wanna see us be great . #EOhellNO
Collective bargaining has been the largest factor driving a wedge between the middle class and the top 1 percent. The decline is hitting civil servants hard. Civil servants make America work. #EOhellNO
Labor unions empower everyday people to improve their work environments and negotiate fair wages for all workers. #EOhellNO
