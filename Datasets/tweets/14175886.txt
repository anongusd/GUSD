@nohanft36 @jasonoberer @davegoldenberg @GOP True.  But they really were being socialist - not communist.  And I think the only reasons they made connections to USSR was because we cut them off.

@shutupjaya As for the parental leave thing.  About 1990 when we first started getting maternity leave as a benefit, many women would take the job then leave and not come back.  As a result by 1993 the policy at every university I worked for was that you had to come back and work or repay.

Other tools have been developed over the years but many are no longer valid because they were programmed based on previous situations and technology environments.  Those tools explain that if you go to visit them.  My advice at this point is when in doubt - use your airlock. /fin
Botsentinel works very well. https://t.co/FdNKDG4as2  Key is to remember that not all trollbots are Russian and trolls are human controlled accounts/bots are machine controlled accounts and they can be both. 11/x.
Finally, two tools that DO work.  But you have to read the instructions and background to use them effectively. 1. https://t.co/X3gCfBsTEF works to find BOTS not trolls or trollbots. It lumps social media management tool users in with bots. It is a good first check though. 10/x
How Governments Are Deploying Disinformation as Part of Broader Digital Harassment Campaigns - https://t.co/7PUDCbKm1Q  is not just about 'governments' but those who control governments or want to do so. 9/x
A Global Guide to State Terrorism - https://t.co/3OKIbYOXvw . Yes trolls/bots are used terroristically and to horrifying effect at times.
other anti-human ideas.   Those are the problem.  I'm not going to try to write an essay on these.  Instead I'm going to give you a core reading list.  None of these is over-technical.  I think the test is in progress. 7/x.
Social media manipulators can be working for 'benign' purposes. e.g. to sell us a product or an even to push an idea that is humane and ethical.   Most have some kind of agenda.  But don't we all in our way?  Unethical, inhumane trolls/bots push violence, hatred, racism, and, 6/x
Trolls and Bots are NOT just Russian. The same billionaires that pay for massive ad buys in media also hire social media manipulators.  These don't even need to be numerous.  1 person working full time can manage many many troll/bot accounts. We call them 'socks'.  5/x
Don't feed the classic or the propaganda trolls/bots who are PAID or programmed or sadistically enjoy to waste your time - they are vampires who suck out your life and energy. Don't engage with them.  Report them as fake or pretending to be real and block them. 4/x
To further confuse things some people are just trolls.  I call them 'classic trolls', almost quaint. https://t.co/VoAvISIQVX  It is my advice that all trolls and all bots be reported and blocked.  3/x
Also, trolls and bots are NOT the same thing BUT they do work together and one account can often switch from human controlled (troll) to machine managed (bot) at any point. 2/x
Thread on trolls and bots reality checking.  First, @jack @twitter COULD do something automatically and maybe they are.  The tools do exist to do ongoing monitoring and blocking. The key is to understand that Putin is NOT the only entity paying trolls and running bots 1/x
