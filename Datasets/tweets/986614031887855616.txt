This is not "prayer" for a remedy; this is a crime!  More to come, 	deservingly.  These are not papal problems -- they are criminal!!!  I am glad @Pontifex is seeking courage to fix this and bring us back home:		https://t.co/XAOwfSrfxE

@NationalCorn @NCGA_DC is spot on.  This is wrong, and @EPAAWheeler knows better for the wrong application that inconsistent with the intent of the #RFS.  Given the recent history @EPA granting these waivers, I guess we should not be surprised...  PATHETIC!!! https://t.co/GMnd3YOJNi
"You can't be serious" @realDonaldTrump @EPAAWheeler @EPA!!!  Record profits for @exxonmobil and you give relief.  They are NOT a spall refiner. You are a joke!  IA voters will remember this, so will ethanol and corn producers: 		https://t.co/Le8tq6GCif

Kind of unrelated to corn, but @DickDurbin @SenatorDurbin and @GrassleyPress @GrassleyWorks @ChuckGrassley @SenatorCharles did a good thing here (https://t.co/SjusiWVFnI).  Lets keep that BIPARTISAN momentum going as we look at the future of ethanol!!!  Who's with me???
IS @Comey running for President?  Watch him closely!  They say, its always someone NOT in the current field at this time will emerge.  Where is he on corn?  Be thinking...
So does this mean our corn farmers have less access to health care, a growing need in rural America?		https://t.co/9abfzHdKLG
