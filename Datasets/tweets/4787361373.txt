@FinalSpero @People4Bernie @BernieSanders Also, Beto already said he won't run in the senate race. :/
@FinalSpero @People4Bernie @BernieSanders It's surprising how many people vote straight-ticket in Texas... turning it blue for the presidential race could very well turn it blue for the senate race, too. Beto knows Texas and could actually do that. I don't know that Bernie can alone.

@RepByrne @BetsyDeVosED @SenTedCruz If people don't want the government to pick their healthcare, why would they let them pick who gets a better education?		...because the poorest Americans all believe that *they* are the special one who would get picked...
@RepByrne @BetsyDeVosED @SenTedCruz So... instead of funding public schools, we're going to dump more money into charter schools? Oh, and the government gets to pick who gets "educational freedom"?		Sounds like a great way to keep the poorest Americans under-educated.

@RetSNCO @AOC With you they shall be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel. In whatever tribe the sojourner resides, there you shall assign him his inheritance, declares the Lord God (Ezekiel 47:22-23)
@RetSNCO @AOC You shall allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the sojourners who reside among you and have had children among you. They shall be to you as native-born children of Israel.
@RetSNCO @AOC You shall not oppress a sojourner. You know the heart of a sojourner, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt (Exodus 23:9)		Let brotherly love continue. Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares (Hebrews 13:1-2)
@RetSNCO @AOC Show hospitality to one another without grumbling (1 Peter 4:9)		If your brother becomes poor and cannot maintain himself with you, you shall support him as though he were a stranger and a sojourner, and he shall live with you (Leviticus 25:35)
@RetSNCO @AOC When a stranger sojourns with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong. You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God (Leviticus 19: 33-34).
@RetSNCO @AOC But no stranger had to spend the night in the street, for my door was always open to the traveller (Job 31:32)		Let strangers feast on your wealth and your toil enrich the house of another (Proverbs 5:10)
@RetSNCO @AOC False.		For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me (Matthew 25:35)		Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God (Romans 15:7)

@CarsontheBruce @realDonaldTrump @Sue564 You mean the one who refused to sign a UNANIMOUS Senate bill to throw a tantrum in public? UNANIMOUS sounds a lot like working across the aisle to me, no?
