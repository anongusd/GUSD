RT @SFlaniganZTR: Vehicle drives off Maysville Pike into a frozen pond in Newton Township. Photos: http://t.co/s6Twp25pai #trnow http://t.c‚Ä¶
Topography of the pond is such that it's shaped like stairs, and the car could be on any of the "steps." #trnow
The car still hasn't been found so the priority tomorrow is finding it and then responders will plan how to get it out. #trnow
Search will resume at 9am tomorrow. #trnow
Search is called off for the night, divers have zero visibility and it's getting too cold for them to be in the water. #trnow
It's about 12 degrees out right now. Initially, crews had to cut through three inches of ice. #trnow
Also divers from Fairfield County are here. #trnow
Every time the divers go in, which is down to a 10-15 min rotation, ice reforms on the pond's surface. #trnow
The original call came in at about 3:30, the sheriffs office called the OHP, who's at the scene now with Newton, Falls Twps Fire. #trnow
It's getting pretty dark. But floodlights were brought in and divers are still working. #trnow
It's difficult to even get to the water, though, with a lot of brush covering what is essentially a straight drop. #trnow
Divers are only staying in the water for 15 to 20 min, they think the car is about 20 to 30 feet down, on a ledge. #trnow
The water is so cold that by the time first responders arrived, ice had reformed over the spot the vehicle went in, accd to OHP. #trnow
Newton TWP Fire Chief said crews will work up to an hour for cold water rescues, and at this point it's a recovery mission. #trnow
Pond is part of Maysville Water District. #trnow
First responders don't know how many victims they're looking for or what kind of car went into the pond. #trnow

The boat the missing men were driving was stolen, accd to the ODNR. #trnow
Boat's coming back around. Still nothing, it looks like. #trnow
To use their sonar most effectively in this fast current, the boat is simply drifting down the river. #trnow http://t.co/NYamxvr6m4
Much smaller crowd today. Still some spectators though. #trnow
One boat is back on the water. #trnow
Area Supervisor Jason Latchic said he'd likely have more information in about an hour. #trnow
Witnesses reported seeing the men get into a boat yesterday afternoon. #trnow
One guy had dark facial hair, one had tan shorts on. And those might be the same guy. #trnow
Still don't know exactly who they're looking for, but ODNR is pretty sure it's two white males, late 20s to early 30s. #trnow
Starting a few hours ago, the state highway patrol has been flying over the river in a helicopter to help with the search. #trnow
The sonar is most effective at 1.5-3 mph, and the river is currently running at 6-8 mph. #trnow
The rain is making the river run faster, which is impeding ODNR's sonar capability. #trnow
