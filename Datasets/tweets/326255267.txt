@ScottJenningsKY In my opinion, it‚Äôs not comparable. King finally went too far, yes, but he 	helped set immigration policy for the GOP for 13 years. He chaired GOP campaigns for president and had the power to have every GOP presidential candidate campaign w/him in Iowa if they wanted to win.

One of the most important things you can do to stop some of these calls is install anti-robo call applications on your phone. @nomorobo, which helped us with our story for examples blocks calls from numbers they've picked up as spam and send them to your voicemail.
Agencies like the FEC, FTC, and FCC can levy fines and judgements through courts. But the DOJ handles charging scam criminally and our laws are woefully not prepared to enable broad enforcement.

@web_rant @yashar different Tunstall.
@philliesfan1000 the calls come in from non-working numbers when you call back, designed to look like they're coming from DC.
While the group is targeting Trump supporters now. Past calls from those associated w/it targeted Democrats (Clinton &amp; Sanders supporters in 2016) through Progressive Priorities PAC. 2017 calls used Obama's voice as well without his consent or knowledge.		https://t.co/JuQWVcsioI
The operation effectively amounts to paying for ads to raise money to pay for more ads, with Tunstall taking home whatever money doesn't get used to pay for more ads. The enterprise appears to break rules policed by 3 different federal agencies on impersonation and ad disclosure.
Tunstall's group raised more than $100,00 in January alone. He insisted any calls with "I'm Donald Trump" were "technical errors" but he ran calls we found last year using Obama's voice which a spox for Obama said were reported law enforcement. 		https://t.co/B6tnLDvqE8
The charge revealed the name of the payment processor, Rally, which when contacted told us the money went to "Support American Leaders PAC" a group registered w/the FEC run by Matthew Tunstall ‚Äì a man with a history of running shady liberal/conservative PACs.
When I asked in call centers who was making the calls they said the Trump campaign, when I pressed them, they said it was "Conservative Leaders PAC" ‚Äì a group that does not exist. We used a prepaid debit card to donate $5 to group to get the name billed which was "Support Trump."
To be connected with the group you had to press 9 on the robocall. This is the only way to reach them. They call you. no website. No callback #. No name of the group in the calls. Once the calls were forwarded to my phone, I pressed a # where I was connected w/the call centers.
Copies of the calls were posted on the website for Nomorobo, an anti-robo call application. The calls include no disclosure or callback number, which would violate FCC/FEC rules. Nomorobo agreed to forward calls to my cellphone from numbers they found making the calls.
We noticed a group was making robocalls during the midterms and in February. The calls began with "I'm Donald Trump" and sound like they're from the Trump campaign but they are not. 		https://t.co/B6tnLDvqE8
How did we found who was running these calls impersonating the Trump campaign, that began with "I'm Donald Trump" and have raised more than $100,000 they claim is for "the campaign." 		A thread and explanation: 		https://t.co/JuQWVcsioI
