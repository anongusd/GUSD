@KasumiNinja @KArgo1621 @thejtlewis @realDonaldTrump As a citizen of the United States Of America who was born here I have always understood that I live in the greatest country in the world. We can come from different backgrounds here and still know that laws were made to be followed for a reason.
@KasumiNinja @KArgo1621 @thejtlewis @realDonaldTrump The US is a nation of laws and you and every Democrat know this is a fact. Please explain to me why Democrat‚Äôs behave as if they‚Äôre somehow above our laws? Why they feel the need to support our laws being broken? Support and encourage??
@KasumiNinja @KArgo1621 @thejtlewis @realDonaldTrump I agree 100% that neither party has taken our border seriously. Well, until now that is.

@KArgo1621 @KasumiNinja @thejtlewis @realDonaldTrump You obviously didn‚Äôt listen to what they said.

An episode of Ripleys Y2K says on "Holi" day in India, thousands of wives get to beat hubby with a stick! Wow! Why didn't we think of that?!
@BrandonKrieger Right! Now you know why I had to watch it twice lol. I'm all into it now and find it very interesting.
@BrandonKrieger  Great! I can't wait to hear what you think about it since we have a few other shows in common.
@robwillb  Have you seen #Supernatural? If not you should but be warned its addictive. Think you'll like it since we watch the same shows.
@BrandonKrieger Not really sure but it would be crazy if it is. If you watch it don't write it off til you see the 2nd episode too.
Watching "Battle: Los Angeles" and liking it so far.
@BrandonKrieger Had to watch the premier twice bc I thought I missed something lol. Now I watch every wk. Great storyline.
@BrandonKrieger Think I've seen it a few times. I'm really liking American Horror Story so far. Do you watch it?
@BrandonKrieger Exactly. Each episode I'm just waiting for him to appear. He's too important to be gone for good.
@BrandonKrieger I sure hope so and if so I can't wait to see how they write him back in. He's been kibbles & bits before and returned.
@BrandonKrieger  #Supernatural is at the top of my dvr list each season. I watch both daily reruns every day too lol.
