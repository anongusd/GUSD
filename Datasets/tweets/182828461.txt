Cryptocurrency companies are leaving states like New York and going to more friendly states like Wyoming, according to Hajeski. #NESTOA18
This what in reference to the fact that New York has BitLicense. Apparently any company that wants to sell in the state has to have a license, according to Hajeski. Here's some more info: https://t.co/YPkda5Jomx #NESTOA18

Bonardi says she and other reps are presenting this info at all of the regional tax conferences to spread the word &amp; look for people to join. #NESTOA18
Bonardi says it may seem counter intuitive to share tax information, but it's important to do so to find and handle threats. #NESTOA18
Second panelist says there were 114 alerts reported through ISAC, mostly from partner DORs. They're partnered with 30 state DORs. #NESTOA18
What's difference between the security summit and ISAC? Summit establishes policy and action, whereas ISAC is a real-time sharing platform. #NESTOA18

That panel has concluded! #NESTOA18
Audience member asks if SSUTA states are being compliant after #SDvWayfair. Johnson says overall yes; "no new issues." #NESTOA18
On implementation dates, Johnsons says states need to give remote sellers enough time to prepare. #NESTOA18
Johnson says one of the worse things SSTGB could've done after #SDvWayfair is be silent. People need to know what's going on. #NESTOA18
Johnson says he recently met with @JimPressOffice's staff to figure out what was going on with the "No Regulation Without Representation Act." They said nothing &amp; seems no mention of new online sales tax bill. #NESTOA18
Johnsons says last week he met with members of the @HouseJudiciary and on online sales taxation said: We want you to do nothing. #NESTOA18
Johnson says in talks with some states about SSTGB, but most calls from the biz community asking "How the heck am I going to collect?" #NESTOA18
Johnson: What SSTGB has done since #SDvWayfair:	1. Reach out to every state w/ a sales tax that's not part of it	2. Find out the roadblocks as to why not join	3. If not join, consider using CSPs, central registration system  #NESTOA18
Reynolds: What is constitutional minimum? No ruling from #SCOTUS.	The further a state's law is from SD, the higher the litigation risk. #NESTOA18
Johnson says #SCOTUS majority in #SDvWayfair "went to great lengths" to add the info about the features "that appear designed to prevent discrimination against or undue burdens upon interstate commerce." #NESTOA18

Reynolds asked audience if #SCOTUS will: 	A. overturn #Quill	B. uphold #Quill	C. overturn #Quill only for the states that went the route of South Dakota.		Most didn't vote, but majority was for B. #statetax #SDvWayfair
Garrett said he found one #SCOTUS justice's comment strange that if #Quill was overturned, it would help some of the big sellers. 	@SteveDelBianco responded that the burden would make "small sellers with standalone stores disappear" leaving only big sellers. #statetax #SDvWayfair

So now it's just a question of whether that definition of physical presence will change after #SCOTUS rules in South Dakota v. Wayfair, and how Washington reacts to that. (Please feel free to weigh in!) #NCSLinDC #statetax
@jbhenchman A little clarification (thanks to Bruce Johnson):	https://t.co/eSrGVK5v2X		But everyone can read the letter now (and let me know your thoughts!):	https://t.co/AMI2XMRAeO
BUT, they seem to be warning remote sellers "who may have had physical nexus" to participate in the voluntary disclosure program. So it's still a bit murky (at least to my understanding), and Washington DOR is saying more info might be coming. https://t.co/zANDfn0hNN
CLARIFICATION: The letter from the Washington DOR doesn't *necessarily* say the DOR will or officially plans to go after those past tax liabilities. Key paragraph: https://t.co/ROgBjE6tiJ
Actually, that letter to the editor has been published. You can find it here: https://t.co/8rh28WIauV
An attendee asked if there are any states pursuing retroactivity at the moment. Johnson said he "pleads the fifth" and didn't want to name "enemies." 		However, we have a letter to the editor running Monday from Washington's DOR that the state plans to do so. #statetax #NCSLinDC
Johnson says states should adopt SSTGB provisions to provide uniformity when it comes to sales tax collection requirements for the business community. 		"Why not adopt that? I‚Äôm a great fan of state sovereignty, but exercise it wisely."		#statetax #NCSLinDC
RT @KaylaEpstein: Hello! I will be covering the #MarchForOurLives in DC on social for @washingtonpost. Here's how to follow me:		- Twitter:‚Ä¶
Johnson: It's not fair &amp; may not be entirely legal to tell retailers "you didn't know about this [sales tax collection obligation] and we didn't tell you, but you should've collected last year." "Don't even think about going there." #statetax #NCSLinDC
Johnson says the discussion that "you could do retroactivity is misguided." 		"South Dakota took the high road and did the right thing." #statetax #NCSLinDC
Johnson on state implementation of online sales tax collection: "We need to be able to do this right. We don't want to screw this up." #statetax #NCSLinDC
For mail notices, Johnson says states should set up one track for internet sellers &amp; another for in-state retailers to avoid confusion over compliance. #NCSLinDC
Johnson: People all over the country who don't know a thing about your state tax laws trying to comply. "They're just trying to sell goods." #statetax #NCSLinDC
Johnson: Out-of-state retailers need to be able to go to 1 place to get the right rates, info, etc. so that they can collect correctly.		"If you don‚Äôt have that, you need to have that. It‚Äôs the right thing to do, but it‚Äôs also the only sensible thing to do." #NCSLinDC
Johnson re: out-of-state retailers signing up for a sales tax license: "You need to consider having an accelerated registration process." #statetax #NCSLinDC
Johnson: One implication of #SCOTUS ruling in favor of South Dakota would be an influx of out-of-state retailers who need to register w/ the state to collect sales tax. 		"Are you ready for that?" Johnson asks lawmakers at #NCSLinDC

@jbhenchman Personal observation: Flurry of activity from NCSL staff here after the vote. #NCSLinMiami
.@jbhenchman tells me this is the 1st time he's seen something like this &amp; has been attending these meetings for ~8 yrs. #NCSLinMiami
What's next: NCSL Budget &amp; Revenue Committee will discuss this at their meeting in San Diego on Dec. 13. BUT they cannot make any changes b/c this change was not introduced 30 days before that meeting. Needed to be intro'ed by Nov. 13.
North Dakota Sen. Dwight Cook said "better if we revisit it" b/c don't want to send a message that every state supports this stance. #NCSLinMiami
Vote came out of discussion of NCSL stance on SALT deduction in #taxreform. Some states said they favored the deduction b/c would help state. #NCSLinMiami

A simple chart on how federal #taxreform could affect the states #NCSLinMiami https://t.co/1u9GcxibZC
@DebPetersForSD And room consensus is that the $500K is on the loan balance, not the home value. #NCSLinMiami
@DebPetersForSD Friedan said it's typically on the taxpayer to report home value, not banks.
.@DebPetersForSD on House proposal to limit mortgage interest deduction at $500K: "How are [banks] going to know if a home's value is going to exceed $500K?" She said people could renovate, pay in cash &amp; that raises the value of the home, but how would banks know? #NCSLinMiami
Friedan says biggest impact on states re: individual income tax proposals for #taxreform is "more on the fiscal side." #NCSLinMiami
Friedan: States will have to look at this carefully. If conform, they could get some revenue from foreign-source income. 		"Stuff on this page is going to happen if tax reform happens," he says.	#NCSLinMiami

.@jbhenchman‚Äôs chart. He says hand-written notes &amp; random text is b/c of changes made to the bills since early last week. #NCSLinMiami https://t.co/UpkPg2sx4M
Friedan: States might be tempted to adopt net interest deductions to get that revenue &amp; not adopt immediate expensing, which could be a "fairness issue."	#NCSLinMiami
Friedan: Two things that will affect states in #taxreform:	‚ñ™Ô∏èimmediate expensing of biz investments in certain new &amp; used assets for 5 years (if conform, states will lose $)	‚ñ™Ô∏èlimit net interest  deductions to 30% of ATI (states conform, get $)	#NCSLinMiami
Friedan: 2017 #taxreform bills are "much, much more complicated than the last time this happened." Last time was more rate reductions &amp; base broadening, whereas 2017 bills would really change things. #NCSLinMiami

@rbzahradnik Quick clarification: D.C. is included in this total tally, which adds up to 51. D.C. is actually categorized as "making progress." #NCSLinMiami
@curtbramble .@curtbramble says this allows lawmakers to get a "peek behind the curtain."
.@curtbramble: What Utah is doing is formed a legislative committee that meets w/ state econ agency to look over incentives state is offering companies it's courting; legislators sign nondisclosure agreements since still in negotiation. #NCSLinMiami

@DiannLSmith Oops, looks like this tweet didn't post:	Reynolds: State lawmakers will have two uniform model acts to choose from on unclaimed property: the ULC one &amp; the ABA one. #NCSLinMiami
.@DiannLSmith talking about ABA drafting its own unclaimed property model law after failing to resolve concerns w/ Uniform Law Commission. Background:	https://t.co/QcUTb8QqQW	#NCSLinMiami
.@DiannLSmith recommends audience to go on state websites &amp; search their names  for unclaimed property. "You may have unclaimed property." #NCSLinMiami
Reynolds: Goal of unclaimed property laws is to "reunite lost property w/ its owners." He added that it gets tricky when state starts to see that as revenue. #NCSLinMiami
Now onto last session of the day for #NCSLinMiami: Unclaimed Property with:	‚ùñ @DiannLSmith of @McDermottLaw 	‚ùñ Pat Reynolds of @COSTNews	#NCSLinMiami
.@DebPetersForSD asking Reynolds on real-time sales tax collection:	"Pat, let me guess: it's a really bad idea?"	Reynolds: "It's a really bad idea." #NCSLinMiami
Reynolds on real-time sales tax collection: "The question is why would you want to?" 		He says a state could get all the same benefits as real-time sales tax collection "by simply requiring an estimated prepayment." #NCSLinMiami
@verizon .@verizon participated in a study with 3 other telecomm companies in MA. Study found that between the 4 companies, they had 125 different billing systems, Kittrick says. #NCSLinMiami
Kittrick says it would have been "impossible" for @verizon to comply with Mass. real-time sales tax collection proposal by June 1, 2018 deadline. #NCSLinMiami
Payment processors would also incur "significant costs" to collect &amp; remit sales tax in real time, including creating new software, Mackey says. #NCSLinMiami
Mackey: To implement real-time sales tax collection by June 1 in MA, it would have cost businesses over $1 billion to comply. #NCSLinMiami
Reynolds: Several states have considered &amp; rejected real-time sales tax collection:	‚ñ™Ô∏èConnecticut	‚ñ™Ô∏èMassachusetts	‚ñ™Ô∏èNebraska	‚ñ™Ô∏èNew York	‚ñ™Ô∏èPuerto Rico	#NCSLinMiami

Beals says he anticipates the banking issues related to marijuana businesses (i.e. cash problem) will be "covered" by the end of 2018. #NCSLinMiami
@RepMacco .@Pamela_Althoff responds that this #NCSLinMiami presentation just focused on the tax &amp; revenue aspect of marijuana legalization b/c its a SALT task force meeting.
.@RepMacco says he'd like to see law enforcement be part of the discussion on marijuana legalization to get the other side of the argument besides that it's a job creator &amp; revenue generator. #NCSLinMiami
.@DebPetersForSD summing it up: States are "overtaxing &amp; overregulating" b/c they're "scared, although that's not the right word." 		Beals: Yes. States also disappointed b/c tax revenue isn't what they projected. 	#NCSLinMiami
@DebPetersForSD Beals says that in part it's b/c states see legalized marijuana as a "cash cow" &amp; want to use that revenue for budget shortfalls. Part of it is "muddled policy." #NCSLinMiami
.@DebPetersForSD asks Beals why states coming up w/ new tax models/systems for marijuana when they already have these for tobacco, alcohol, etc. #NCSLinMiami
Beals: Marijuana legalization has "undeniable ability to be a job creator &amp; generate tax revenue." But for states that want to keep prohibition, "the question is: Are you OK with 14% of population buying off the illegal market?" #NCSLinMiami
Marijuana legalization also has an effect on alcohol, tobacco &amp; prescription drug markets, which states need to consider, Beals said. #NCSLinMiami
Beals said @weedmaps has found that new marijuana consumers, "if pricing is high or ease of access is low," ppl become indifferent about buying the product legally/illegally. #NCSLinMiami
Beals on marijuana legalization challenges: "Part of it is a tax thing," but also about lab/testing the products &amp; brands. #NCSLinMiami

Beals said there's an ongoing threat of losing federal grant funding for orgs &amp; colleges doing research on marijuana. #NCSLinMiami
Beals: Misconception that recreational marijuana is legalized in all of Colorado, Alaska &amp; Washington. Some counties &amp; localities in those states have banned it. #NCSLinMiami
Beals: Americans' views on marijuana is changing; more support for it; including a growing amount of Republican support for medical marijuana. #NCSLinMiami
Beals: @weedmaps is not pushing for marijuana legalization. But states that have legalized it "should have the smallest illegal market." #NCSLinMiami
Beals of @weedmaps says received "increasing number" of inquiries from states that legalized marijuana saying "what do we do now?" #NCSLinMiami
@weedmaps CORRECTION: I incorrectly spelled Quam's last name. My apologies.
Qualm on @weedmaps: It doesn't sell, cultivate, or grow the product. Instead, it provides data to gov'ts re medical &amp; recreational marijuana on "how to do it right" re: taxation &amp; regulation. #NCSLinMiami

@amazon Which leads to our next applicant: Boston. Mayor @marty_walsh told @WBUR yesterday that the bid is focused on East Boston. #AmazonHQ2
@amazon N.H. doesn't seem to be offering an Amazon-tailored incentive package; it seems most applicants are. Also, N.H. trash-talked Boston: https://t.co/HpxuBO2pky

The last and final #NESTOA17 panel session is over.
McNamara: We also have to think about how this will affect the audit team. #NESTOA17
Q from audience: Hiring new team for marijuana taxation? Incorporate into tobacco team? 	McNamara: Haven't decided yet. #NESTOA17
McNamara: Product has changed, but ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø	Mass. DOR is still figuring it out. #NESTOA17
Samsom: Do you need to close that loophole? B/c company preparing edibles has to buy marijuana, which is already taxed. #NESTOA17
McNamara said what he really wants addressed: tax treatment of ingestibles, to make sure they are not exempt from sales tax. #NESTOA17
‚ñ™Ô∏èIT programming efforts	‚ñ™Ô∏ètax treatment of ingestibles	‚ñ™Ô∏èbanking &amp; cash concerns 2/2 #NESTOA17
McNamara: Current DOR worklist for marijuana implementation:	‚ñ™Ô∏ècoordination w/ treasurer, control commission &amp; advisory board 1/2 #NESTOA17
Just noticed this at the bottom of McNamara's presentation ü§î #NESTOA17 https://t.co/Weif9RLoAS
Lawmakers changed Mass. marijuana ballot measure: upping tax rates, but not changing the basic tax structure, McNamara said. #NESTOA17
McNamara: Since marijuana legalization came thru via ballot measure, it proposed a "relatively simple tax structure." #NESTOA17
@morganrscarboro Thanks! And thank you for following along üòä
Unlike Maine, Massachusetts already has local option taxes. No need to start like scratch, as Maine is doing, McNamara says. #NESTOA17
McNamara now talking about the new Mass. marijuana law: https://t.co/aQEHUIA18K #NESTOA17
McNamara: Maine is now a competitor. People won't be driving down from Maine to Massachusetts (to buy marijuana). #NESTOA17
McNamara: Revenue estimation challenges:	‚ñ™Ô∏èlittle info on elasticity of demand, consumer behavior	‚ñ™Ô∏èdata based on other states #NESTOA17
The way a state approaches/passes marijuana legalization will affect the outcome, McNamara said. #NESTOA17 https://t.co/dmZ19QFbId
McNamara: What's worst part of working on prepping state for legal cannabis? All the jokes. Spend 25 min of 1 hr meeting joking. #NESTOA17
Now we've got Bill McNamara from @MassRevenue speaking about his state's process toward regulating &amp; taxing marijuana. #NESTOA17

@VTDeptTaxes @GovPhilScott For more info on that advisory committee: https://t.co/5Hl6ZJKHCT #NESTOA17
.@VTDeptTaxes Commissioner Kaj Samsom asked majority of ?s. (Maybe b/c @GovPhilScott created commission to study marijuana?) #NESTOA17
Lewis: Nothing in the bill regarding use tax, but could change. Legislative committee to work on proposal next week. #NESTOA17
Q from audience: Thought of use tax on marijuana, since ppl can come into state, buy it, and then use it elsewhere? #NESTOA17
@VTDeptTaxes Lewis: It's something new for us. #NESTOA17
.@VTDeptTaxes Commissioner Kaj Samsom: About locals getting slice of tax revenues, is that administration burdensome for you? #NESTOA17
Lewis now talking about the proposal put forward by maine legalization committee. More info here: https://t.co/KWw5GQQ4hg #NESTOA17
Lewis: If those ppl have voted "no," marijuana might not be legal in Maine. There was a vote recount: https://t.co/13AVOrhslC #NESTOA17
Maine legalized marijauna via ballot measure last November. Lewis said 1.57% left the ballot blank on that question. 1/2 #NESTOA17

And panel on ISAC has concluded. The last session of #NESTOA17 (called Ramping Up for Cannabis Legalization) starts at 10:45 a.m.
Egaas says he'd like to see larger gov't community sharing info. Ppl committing tax fraud may also be committing healthcare fraud #NESTOA17
Egaas says this ‚§¥Ô∏è is a myth. You don't have to be a partner to get access to ISAC alerts. It's a common misconception. #NESTOA17
@CTDRS Egaas: Maybe in the future. "The sooner we identify [fraud], the cheaper it is." #NESTOA17
.@CTDRS Commissioner: Are biz partners in ISAC going to take a more aggressive role in stopping fraud? 	Egaas: Unclear right now. #NESTOA17
Bonardi: ISAC good for quick collaboration. Also, join now, you get to have a say in where the partnership goes &amp; focuses on. #NESTOA17
Egaas: ISAC becomes more beneficial as more states join the partnership. #NESTOA17
Egaas: If you want alerts out of the ISAC platform, you're going to have to become part of the ISAC. #NESTOA17
RI DOR staffer: Rhode Island is still in consideration stage. #NESTOA17
Egaas says it's free of cost, which is especially helpful given many states are strapped for cash &amp; resources. #NESTOA17
Bonardi says if state doesn't have data warehouse, Maryland found this to be very beneficial of being part of ISAC. #NESTOA17
Bonardi says Maryland Comptroller's Office worked w/ AG office and found a way to participate. #NESTOA17
MD deputy comptroller: There is a way to participate in ISAC, even if can't release that level of detail. Maryland has done it. #NESTOA17
Here's the PowerPoint Egaas is using at #NESTOA17 (looks to be the same as the one used at SEATA). https://t.co/MhjtMY4Q1E
Egaas said IRS pivot to ISAC was not easy. "If you've ever worked for the IRS, you know we're not known as a sharing organization" #NESTOA17
Egaas: "ISAC is a buzzword." Information sharing is not just used in the tax world, but other industries, such as aviation. #NESTOA17
Todd Egaas of the IRS: "2015 was a pivotal year for the IRS." The security summit met. For background: https://t.co/7kGejawi0r #NESTOA17
@heypattibisson Thank you! And I'll be live tweeting the rest of the session (I think we're scheduled to disassemble at noon). #NESTOA17
Speakers: Sharonne Bonardi, Maryland deputy comptroller &amp; Todd Egaas of the IRS. #NESTOA17
Session on Lean Management for DORs has concluded. Now onto "Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC)." #NESTOA17
.@VTDeptTaxes Commissioner Kaj Samsom: Take your folks out of their daily grind &amp; give them an opp to look at these processes. #NESTOA17
I think this slide in Farnham's presentation woke everyone up (and elicited some laughs) #NESTOA17 https://t.co/Ykf5ExSPmt
Changing processes can empower operational staff to propose changes, boost staff morale, and increase efficiency. #NESTOA17
Farnham: "It's difficult, but it can be done." #NESTOA17
If need to get things done like create new processes, Farnham says "lock ppl in a room for 3-5 days &amp; see what they come up w/." #NESTOA17 https://t.co/HlQDgavZ6Z
Farnham says DOR staffs need to check on things &amp; be honest. "If no progress has been made, report it." #NESTOA17
Farnham says DOR staff knows what they're doing; let them do it and try not to micromanage or look over their shoulder. #NESTOA17
Farnham says it's hard for DORs to know when customers are satisfied. Typically those customers want to be left alone. #NESTOA17
‚ñ™Ô∏èreplacement for Six Sigma or other QI tools -- it's complementary	‚ñ™Ô∏è"manufacturing thing" ... anymore 2/2 #NESTOA17
Farnham: Lean is NOT	‚ñ™Ô∏èan acronym	‚ñ™Ô∏èa solution to personnel/performance issues	‚ñ™Ô∏èinitiative to reduce headcount	‚ñ™Ô∏èquick fix 1/2 #NESTOA17
Farnham: Lean is not something new [for DORs]. See below: #NESTOA17 https://t.co/ieLzlBVK6d
Today is the final day of #NESTOA17. First up: Lean Management for DORs. Speaker: Doug Farnham of @VTDeptTaxes.
@WindwardTax You're welcome! Thank you for following along -- Glad to see my fervent attempt to live tweet the panels has not gone unnoticed üòÄ
@heypattibisson Thanks, Patti! And thanks for following along!
"Free at last, free at least, thank God almighty, you're free at last!" Sullivan says, closing today's final #NESTOA17 panel. See you tmrw.
Sullivan: Put Quill aside for a moment ... what does @Newegg do? It's a mall. It's a technology mall. #NESTOA17
.@juliepmagee to Sullivan: I think we need to start a kill Quill chant. 	(Note: This elicited some laughter, but no chanting). #NESTOA17
Sullivan: "We're seeing state by state ... people pushing the envelope on the premise of what is taxable." #NESTOA17
Tax practitioner: Companies w/ business in multiple states have to deal w/ complicated rules that are different in each state. #NESTOA17
Sullivan: We're already having conversations on how to repurpose shopping centers b/c "they're closing left and right." #NESTOA17
Challenges when it comes to taxing "dark matter" like e-commerce and digital services. #NESTOA17 https://t.co/jmvFI6S9Go
"This area is going to continue to confuse and confound us," Sullivan says. #NESTOA17
Sullivan: This relates to "dark matter" b/c unsure how to tax some of these new or digital businesses. #NESTOA17
Version 3.0 of the sharing economy "Honeycomb." #NESTOA17 https://t.co/NdEcpcg2pJ
@amazon For more on this, check out @alhstn's article: https://t.co/BHYsttUXMy #NESTOA17
Sullivan on @amazon not collecting sales tax on 3rd party sellers on their site: "Half their business is still out in the dark." #NESTOA17
Sullivan re online sales: "There's a simpler solution: a VDA." #NESTOA17
"We're not at the compel and compliance phase yet," Sullivan says. #NESTOA17
Connecticut has asked top companies selling online how much their sales into CT are &amp; who they are selling to, Sullivan says. #NESTOA17
Sullivan: So long as we exist under the "false rubric of Quill," states are unable to tax many online sales &amp; get revenue. #NESTOA17
Sullivan: "There is a mismatch between the law as it stands and the marketplace as it exists." #NESTOA17
E-commerce is an example of dark matter, Sullivan says. #NESTOA17
Sullivan: Connecticut collects about $4.3 billion in sales tax. There's about a $300 million sales tax gap. #NESTOA17
Speaker: @CTDRS Commissioner Kevin Sullivan takes the stage. #NESTOA17
Online home sharing and digital economy session has concluded. Up next is "Tax Gap (Dark Matter: New Commercial Economy &amp; Taxes.) #NESTOA17
Tax officials must work on outreach and education to ensure taxpayers know, comply &amp; pay the taxes due. #NESTOA17
Milligan on informing taxpayers of their tax liabilities: "Build a website and they will come is not happening." #NESTOA17
Challenges and evolving changes from online home sharing and digital economy. #NESTOA17 https://t.co/kTgyymjzDc
72% of Americans have used some type of shared or on-demand online service, says Milligan, citing @pewresearch data. #NESTOA17
Those who took out a loan for a NYC taxi medallion, Milligan says "They're toast. They're done" w/ TNC popularity. #NESTOA17
Milligan reviews definitions of sharing economy &amp; characteristics of it, one of which is significant growth of non-employer firms. #NESTOA17
Milligan: 50-yr-old tax statues are very "straight-jacket-y." Must think creatively about how to fit new biz into tax structures. #NESTOA17
Milligan: To tax the digital economy, tax officials need to "find out who the taxpayers are and get them into compliance." #NESTOA17
"If Americans do anything right, we get markets right," says Milligan of the PA DOR. #NESTOA17
Speaker: Kevin Milligan of the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue. #NESTOA17
I'm back! I'll be live tweeting "Online Home Sharing and the Digital Economy-- Evolving Challenges for State Taxation." #NESTOA17
@steffdaz Lol. The sad part is that I barely scratch the surface. You should hear some of the speakers - It's like AU w/ all the acronyms. Miss you!
And with that, federal tax reform session has concluded for lunch. #NESTOA17
Wlodychak: Fed could make tax reform retroactive, but CA's constitution prohibits the state from doing that. What would happen? #NESTOA17
Semes: Dialogue btwn fed &amp; state officials is necessary b/c it can prepare states for changes to come, esp w/ federal tax reform. #NESTOA17
Q from audience: Is it possible for fed gov't to make tax changes effective 1/1/17?	Wlodychak: Yes, they could make it retroactive #NESTOA17
A little blurry, but U.S. map of states based on their IRC conformity. 	Yellow=fixed	Dark gray=rolling #NESTOA17 https://t.co/RJaUvYgIzx
PowerPoint slide: Even where conformity applies, states have a history of decoupling from unfavorable fed income tax provisions. #NESTOA17
Michael Semes of @EYnews: Will Congress will pass tax reform by end of year?	Wlodychak: Idk. But we'll have language by end of yr. #NESTOA17
Wlodychak: Only 17 more days left of Congress in session to talk tax reform. #NESTOA17
Must-dos for 2017: extending the debt limit, government funding for fiscal 2018, federal aid for areas hit by hurricanes. #NESTOA17
Wlodychak speculating on Trump working w/ Democrats on DACA: "Is it an olive branch to get tax reform?" #NESTOA17
Wlodychak: Lot of press on elimination of SALT deduction hurting blue states, but will also impact red states. #NESTOA17
‚ñ™Ô∏èwhat will revenue impact be?	‚ñ™Ô∏èwill include infrastructure proposals?	‚ñ™Ô∏èwhat anti-base erosion provisions will be included? 2/2 #NESTOA17
Wlodychak says questions on tax reform:	‚ñ™Ô∏èwill it be bipartisan?	‚ñ™Ô∏èwhen will it happen?	‚ñ™Ô∏èwill it propose territorial system? 1/2 #NESTOA17

Wlodychak: "Dates are dwindling fast now. I don't know if it's going to happen this year, or adopted and signed sometime in 2018." #NESTOA17
Wlodychak: More info on fed tax reform expected next week, but not sure if tax reform will happen this year as most are saying. #NESTOA17
@EYnews Wlodychak: U.S. tax system is "out of sync" w/ the rest of the world. #NESTOA17
Steven Wlodychak of @EYnews: One of drivers of federal tax reform is economic growth. #NESTOA17

U.S. economy session now over. Next up: The topic that comes up at every panel w/o fail: state implications of federal tax reform. #NESTOA17
Carry says @federalreserve is taking a "slow-as-you-go" outlook on U.S. economy. "Will they raise the rates?" #NESTOA17
Millienials are buying houses, having kids, &amp; getting married later. Partly b/c they don't want to have mortgage + student debt. #NESTOA17
Carr: More 18-34-year-olds are now living with their parents than with a spouse. #NESTOA17
Carr: Energy cost increases act as tax increases, and vice versa. #NESTOA17
Carr says Hurricane Harvey is going to hurt global oil markets more than ours. #NESTOA17
Carr: There's been a revolution in energy, in energy access, in shale oil &amp; recent fallout has forced operators to be efficient. #NESTOA17
@federalreserve "We could have a huge change in monetary policy" as a result of these appointments, Carr says. #NESTOA17
Carr: An unprecedented # of appointments are going to be made [to the @federalreserve] by this White House." #NESTOA17
Carr: "I'm going to poop a little bit on the people of Maine. They're not doing so well economically." #NESTOA17
Carr: "If anybody tells you they know what's going to happen, they're lying." Hard to predict what Trump administration will do. #NESTOA17
Carr on federal tax reform: "It's going to be tax reform in tax cut clothing on the federal level." #NESTOA17
@realDonaldTrump One thing Trump administration has done is issue a lot of exec orders to undo policies put into place by @BarackObama. #NESTOA17
@realDonaldTrump Carr says reality differed from expectation in WH. "Everyone thought we were going to have a tax cut this year." #NESTOA17
@realDonaldTrump Carr: Voters believed change [in WH] was less of a risk than maintaining the status quo, re: election impact on economy. #NESTOA17
Carr on @realDonaldTrump: "Pay attention to what he does, not what he says." #NESTOA17
... having in those areas growing faster over the long term. So, rebuild more than offsets the damage in areas, Carr says. #NESTOA17
From Harvey &amp; Irma: We're going to lose activity in this quarter, but recovery, repair &amp; rebuild will end up in the economy ... #NESTOA17
Property damage in areas impacted by Hurricanes Harvey &amp; Irma is about the same as that of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. #NESTOA17
Carr: Between Harvey &amp; Irma, combined effect over last 2 weeks has been $250B, w/ property damage, infrastructure damage, etc. #NESTOA17
Hurricanes Harvey &amp; Irma have strong economic significance. Harvey damaged oil refineries, driving up gasoline prices. #NESTOA17
Carr says we're now in the 3rd longest economic "up-cycle" since WWII. #NESTOA17
Jeff Carr of @epreconomics now speaking on US economy on impact of hurricanes, ‚¨áÔ∏èenergy prices, 2016 election, &amp; more. #NESTOA17
That session will start up in about 15 minutes. Stay tuned at #NESTOA17
New partnership audit rules panel is done. Next up: overview of the US economy &amp; impact of recent events like hurricanes, etc. #NESTOA17
MTC rep: "We don't have clarity on where the IRS will end up on some of these things," but will affect states. #NESTSOA17
Representative from MTC: We have a working group looking at IRS changes to the partnership audit rules. Background: https://t.co/74Bu48axP0
Bryan said some have called for the regs to be withdrawn, but "I don't know if that's going to happen." #NESTOA17
Bryan: All we've done is highlight concerns and questions about the proposed regs, what we as practitioners have observed. #NESTOA17
Hyman says Arizona legislation would have an impact, and the state needs to "come out and address this." #NESTOA17
Michael Bryan of @DeloitteTax: What if states don't adopt BBA? Are partners going to have an adjustment to report? #NESTOA17
Hyman says there's a lot of complexity among all partner types when it gets to the state level for new partnership audit rules. #NESTOA17
Todd Hyman of @DeloitteTax: "Will states conform [to IRS changes to partnership audit rules]? Not automatically." #NESTOA17
In non-#NESTOA17 news, Pennsylvania has still yet to pass a revenue package: https://t.co/hStC71rs4p
First session of #NESTOA17 today: BBA-IRS changes to partnership audit rules. For some background on that: https://t.co/B7aZxA88KO
Sales tax nexus panel now over. #NESTOA17 concluded for the day.
Cronin says he thinks other states will "copycat" Mass. remote sales tax reg going forward. #NESTOA17
Keeton: Vermont participating in MTC national nexus program, but not expecting to see a lot of companies step forward. #NESTOA17
Keeton says it would be a great way to require remote sellers to collect and remit sales taxes w/o overturning Quill. #NESTOA17
Keeton on Mass. remote sales tax reg: "I think this is a really great approach." #NESTOA17
Personal side note: If you knew nothing about taxes/nexus/etc., this quote almost makes "cookie nexus" sound like a drug.
"On the street, we call it 'cookie nexus,'" Cronin says, referring to nexus like that of Mass. remote sales tax reg. #NESTOA17
Cronin saying SCOTUS might not take it b/c South Dakota fast-tracked the case &amp; didn't have a developed record. "Who knows?" #NESTOA17
Now Cronin talking about South Dakota Supreme Court ruling in state's remote sales tax law. Background: https://t.co/e01NgRnwCr #NESTOA17
Keeton: I'm wary of Justice Kennedy's invitation to challenge Quill. Some talk about Justice Kennedy retiring next year. #NESTOA17
Cronin says if big businesses have the choice, probably going to go w/ notice requirements over collecting the sales tax. #NESTOA17
Keeton said Vermont has "not seen a drastic uptick in voluntary compliance" in click-through nexus since law took effect. #NESTOA17
Hard to see, but current map of what states have on the remote seller fight #NESTOA17 https://t.co/yzPr4qDAXo
Keeton said he heard that younger Congressmen opposed fed legislation on remote sales tax, seeing it as "attack on the Internet." #NESTOA17
Keeton says it's "not insurmountable" for small &amp; mid-sized businesses to comply w/ remote sales tax, it might just cost a lot. #NESTOA17
Keeton: Technological solution [to remote sales tax] exists. ... It really becomes a question of paying for it." #NESTOA17
Current discussion about arguments opposing federal legislation on remote sales tax: #NESOTA17 https://t.co/tvxImGUjIM
To put in a compliance system could be btwn $80k and $250k, which could hurt smaller businesses. #NESTOA17
But it might have a constraint on mid- to small-size biz. #NESTOA17
Cronin: Remote sales tax federal legislation not really affect big biz, b/c most already collecting &amp; remitting. #NESTOA17
@VTDeptTaxes ‚ñ™Ô∏èthreshold for small businesses	‚ñ™Ô∏ècan 43 states audit 1 company?	‚ñ™Ô∏èwho will have burden for software for compliance?	2/2 #NESTOA17
Kirby Keeton of @VTDeptTaxes: If take Congressional route for remote sales tax, states will have to consider policy options like ... 1/2
Cronin, talking about Quill decision: Physical presence in 1992 perhaps doesn't mean physical presence now. #NESTOA17
Cronin: Who will act first: Congress or SCOTUS? "It's almost like a bad game of chicken" on who will act first or blink first. #NESTOA17
Michael Cronin of Grant Thornton LLP says sales tax nexus is a "big deal" &amp; hasn't seen this level of activity in 2017 "ever." #NESTOA17
RT @NiemanReports: The new project, aiming to place 1,000 journalists in local newsrooms, is akin to Americorps‚Äîw/o the gov. funding https:‚Ä¶
Tax refund fraud panel has concluded. Next up: Sales tax nexus at 3:30 p.m. #NESTOA17
Smith: State DOR agencies should share tax refund fraud info. "We're all in this together." #NESTOA17
Leo Lebeuf of Rhode Island Division of Taxation: If taxpayer has identity theft, their refund is a small piece of their problems. #NESTOA17
@VerendasTweet2: We need to start w/ the assumption that all data has been compromised. #NESTOA17
Attendee who is a practitioner says "worst offender are clients," who are lazy about protecting info &amp; docs. #NESTOA17
Dean Silverman of McKinsey &amp; Company: Some tax preparers not secure enough w/ information &amp; criminal orgs can easily get in. #NESTOA17
Q: Have you been successful w/ going after tax criminals?	Leo Lebeuf of RI DOR: Hard to get agencies to take seriously as a crime. #NESTOA17

@CTDRS Sullivan says they states also rushed to embrace Congress to resolve remote sellers fight, "which has done squat for us." 1/2
@CTDRS Sullivan says he doesn't agree w/ everything states are doing to fight Quill, saying South Dakota is rushing the case to SCOTUS. #NESTOA17
.@CTDRS Commissioner Kevin Sullivan: I re-read Quill ... &amp; it's astound what Quill doesn't stand for, and what Quill doesn't say. #NESTOA17
Bonardi: However, it might be on the table it the future, as well as expanding taxing to other services in the state. 2/2 #NESTOA17
Sharonne Bonardi, MD deputy comptroller: We don't tax digital goods. Nothing will happen this legislative session b/c election year. 1/2

Also relevant to Sullivan's comments on the budget here at #NESTOA17: https://t.co/eI86sWP2F4

CT DOR Commissioner Kevin Sullivan: "We used to be known as state of steady habits. Now we are known as the state of bad habits." #NESTOA17
Now starting the commissioners' roundtable. First up: CT, DE, D.C., ME, and MD. #NESTOA17
Panel on market-based sourcing and apportionment has concluded. Next up: DOR commissioners' roundtable at 10:10 a.m. #NESTOA17
But making no change to market-based sourcing is also a tax policy decision that will affect taxpayers, Davenport says. 3/3
States considering the change weighing political, revenue &amp; policy considerations to come to an agreement, which is difficult. 2/3
Davenport concludes: More states moving toward market-based sourcing; most following MTC model. #NESTOA17 1/3
If NH did enact market-based sourcing, Ward anticipates a "significant delay" before implementation to figure everything out. #NESTOA17
@elizabeth_malm If I had gotten one of those beers, I might be. Alas, I did not. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Ward: No action would be "path of least resistance." But NH legislature could act, which is what some lawmakers are looking at. #NESTOA17

@DavidBrunori @jdhenchman Gardner: If you're cutting taxes, having a mechanism to measure the affordability would be the best. #NCSLSummit
@DavidBrunori .@jdhenchman: If you oppose tax cuts, the no. But I would agree with you. #NCSLSummit

@DavidBrunori @jdhenchman .@jdhenchman: Can do it, but "hard decisions have to be made." #NCSLSummit

Mazerov of @CenterOnBudget: Broad expansion of sales tax to services is not inevitable, but desirable; happening too slow. #NCSLSummit
Mazerov of @CenterOnBudget takes the podium. #NCSLSummit

@elizabeth_malm This looks so cool! I'm looking it up now, being the library nerd I am ü§ì
Leaving today's office. üíÉüèª https://t.co/sXdn3QWVAe
.@HouseJudiciary subcommittee hearing on #HR2887 is now concluded.
@RepGoodlatte @DarrellIssa @DebPetersForSD @DebPetersForSD has spoken *vehemently* against #HR2887 &amp; the other speakers haven't.
.@RepGoodlatte &amp; @DarrellIssa have repeatedly interrupted @DebPetersForSD &amp; almost never interrupted the other 3 speakers, who are all male.
.@RepJayapal: #HR2887 could hurt Washington state's ability to raise revenue &amp; undermine state's ability to find ways to fund services.
.@RepDougCollins: Remote sales taxation &amp; regulatory burden unfairly combined in #HR2887, saying they should be discussed separately.
.@RepDougCollins: I've taken more meetings on this issue (remote sales taxation), than any other issue combined. #HR2887
.@amoylan: If a biz has a physical presence in a state, it collects taxes. "That is not a loophole intended to advantage Internet retailers"
.@RepRatcliffe: What should I be telling them to address those concerns?	@amoylan: I would tell them the law does do that. 2/2 #HR2887
.@RepRatcliffe: When stakeholders come into my office &amp; argue physical nexus requirement creates class of sellers that are above the law 1/2
.@DebPetersForSD: If #HR2887 takes effect, it would "tie the hands" of legislators and "throw South Dakota into a whole other tax regime."
.@amoylan to @RepKenBuck: It's a gray area, but #HR2887 would clear that up.
.@RepKenBuck: Could a state like California regulate a farmer in South Dakota? Or place a tax on products from SD to CA? #HR2887
.@RepKenBuck to @NPPC CEO Neil Dierks: What are your thoughts on @DebPetersForSD's comments on #HR2887 &amp; states affecting other states?
.@RepCicilline: #HR2887 should be called the ‚Äúdestroying locally owned business and destroying state sovereignty act."
.@RepCicilline now giving his opening statement on #HR2887. Says he's a co-sponsor of H.R. 2193, RTPA.
.@RepJohnConyers submit for record letters from 7 orgs, incldg Marketplace Fairness Coalition. @RepGoodlatte submits letters, too. #HR2887
.@RepJohnConyers: "Haven't we improved our technology to the point where the burden on collecting sales tax is practically nonexistent?"
.@DebPetersForSD: #HR2887 forces "states to not be able to deal" w/ issues identified by constituencies and "issues that are local."
.@RepJohnConyers giving his time to @DebPetersForSD so she can "get her idea across to @RepGoodlatte" after tense interaction. #HR2887
.@DebPetersForSD: "I don‚Äôt believe this particular piece of legislation is the solution for the ag community." #HR2887
.@RepGoodlatte: #HR2887 "is simply attempting to respond to what courts have ignored for a number of years now."
Discussion between @RepGoodlatte &amp; @DebPetersForSD on #HR2887 getting heated. Peters said it should be a case by case basis.
.@RepGoodlatte: CA wants to change out-of-state farming practices based on what it thinks is more sustainable. "It's none of CA's business."
.@RepGoodlatte says he's particularly interested in @DebPetersForSD's testimony, saying hers failed to "address the problem." #HR2887
.@DebPetersForSD: RTPA should've been the subject of today's hearing, not #HR2887.
.@DebPetersForSD on #HR2887: "State sovereignty, or states‚Äô rights, is not a doctrine of convenience" &amp; #HR2887 "does NOT codify #Quill."
.@DebPetersForSD speaking out against #HR2887, saying a national "one size fits all" will not work when it comes to this issue.

.@@HouseJudiciary Chairman @RepGoodlatte now makes his opening statement on #HR2887. He is a co-sponsor of the bill.
.@RepJohnConyers urges subcommittee to consider H.R. 2193, also called the Remote Transactions Parity Act (RTPA) instead of #HR2887.
.@RepJohnConyers opposes #HR2887, saying it would "effectively prevent state &amp; local gov'ts from accessing a [big part] of their tax base."
.@RepJohnConyers: #HR2887 "would preempt tens of thousands of state laws."
