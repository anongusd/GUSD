RT @HFXforum: General Joseph F. Dunford, Jr., Chairman of @thejointstaff, United States on American #tech companies working in #China. #HIS‚Ä¶
#GenDunford on @DeptofDefense investments in innovation and experimentation: While being good stewards of resources, we must also take sufficient risk to see what is in the art of the possible in the future. #HISF2018
#GenDunford on professional #military education: Our emphasis now is on teaching future leaders how to think and solve problems in the complex security environment of the 21st century. We're transitioning to a historical case model approach so we're informed by history #HISF2018
#GenDunford on the importance of the military staying apolitical: We are a trusted institution because we remain apolitical. We swear to uphold the Constitution of the United States, our azmith.
#GenDunford on @DeptofDefense border support to @CBP: What we are doing in support of CBP and DHS is filling legitimate capability gaps. Our job is to support DHS in doing their job. #HISF2018
#GenDunford on U.S. @DeptofDefense spending in comparison to other country's defense spending: Democracy can afford survival.		We also have global commitments and responsibilities to our allies and partners as the international guarantor and leader of the free world.	#HISF2018
#GenDunford on dealing w/ #violentextremism: Still need to address the underlying conditions that feed it. We need a sustainable solution, politically, fiscally and militarily in the context of the NDS and the other challenges we face. #HISF2018
#GenDunford on the #INFTreaty: The primary focus has been to move #Russia back into compliance and then deal with emerging technologies. #HISF2018
#GenDunford on #missiledefense and protecting the homeland: "It's about getting the right balance of defensive and offensive capabilities to deal with the enemy's strike capability." #HISF2018
#GenDunford on today's defense of the homeland: We cannot imagine any conflict today that doesn't involve all domains, including the arctic.	 #HISF2018
#GenDunford on U.S. strategy in #Afghanistan: We now have a plan to properly resource the Afghan forces, including training and leadership development. The key to success is to combine military &amp; diplomatic pressure that will lead to an Afghan-led reconciliation process #HISF2018
#GenDunford: Even as we have built up capabilities to assure allies &amp; deter aggression w/ #Russia &amp; #China, our argument has been that competition does not necessarily lead to conflict. We remain transparent in our communications with them to mitigate risk of miscalculation
RT @HFXforum: LIVE NOW - Halifax Chat with General Joseph F. Dunford, Jr., Chairman of @thejointstaff, United States and moderated by @BBCY‚Ä¶
#GenDunford: I'm never complacent about the pace of technological change. It's incumbent upon us to invest in capability development. It's a combination of ideas and technology to remain competitive against #China and #Russia. #HISF2018
#GenDunford on the National Defense Strategy: Today our #military can defend the homeland and meet our alliance commitments. The NDS articulates what is necessary to maintain our competitive advantage into the future in terms of resourcing and technology investment. #HISF2018
