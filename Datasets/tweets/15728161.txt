But despite all that cash, celebrities from Bob Dylan to Jay Leno to Hugh Jackman to Katie Couric throw lavish fundraisers for TM. https://t.co/QVYbZ1fXGA
No wonder TM is so flush According to The Economist, the Maharishi‚Äôs land holdings alone were worth $3 billion in 1998. A 2012 investigation estimated Maharishi‚Äôs real estate assets at the time of his death 10 years later to be worth roughly $9 billion. https://t.co/QVYbZ1fXGA

That's just the start. TM charges $4,000 to learn its advanced program. For $1,000, advanced TM adherents will chant for your newborn child. For $1,250, they'll pray to resolve problems like "government gridlock and extreme partisan infighting.‚Äù https://t.co/QVYbZ1fXGA

@rezaaslan I think the difference is mainline Protestantism is fairly well understood. And TM is presenting itself to its beginners as a simple concentration technique.
@rezaaslan I completely agree with that point, Reza. But read the article ... TM's dubious claims go way further, asserting their meditators lowered the crime rate in certain areas and got American to reject GMOs.
@stevesilberman Steve, I know you've been into meditation for a long time. Members of my family are meditation teachers. But TM is not like other meditation practices or other meditative religions. Take a look at the article and check out what its leaders claim, on the record.
@rezaaslan @thedailybeast Reza, we never call it a cult. And we note that, for lots of people, TM is a simple relaxation technique. But TM's leaders also claim, on the record, that it can trigger these supernatural powers, including the ability to end war and steer political events.

I don't get the news value of Brett Kavanaugh throwing ice on someone 30+ years ago. As far as I can tell, it doesn't speak to alleged assaults or lack of candor under oath -- the real issues here.
@BillBindc @dcbigjohn Yellowman was always overrated. Always. Toyan destroyed him.
@dcbigjohn All incredible acts -- and I say that as someone who backed up Nancy and Horace more than once. But their heydays weren't the mid-80s. Back then, Black Uhuru and Steel Pulse were, um, dread and shoulders above everyone else.
