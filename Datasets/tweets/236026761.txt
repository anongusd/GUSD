Greg Gutfeld, like Tucker Carlson before him, is pushing the ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù argument that there‚Äôs hate on both sides‚Ä¶
Greg Gutfeld says "there‚Äôs a deception being made right here in the media that hateful speech is created by a single man‚Ä¶."
Jesse Watters says Trump‚Äôs press conference was ‚Äúbrave and honest."
Tucker Carlson ‚Äî&gt; The Five
Tucker Carlson doesn‚Äôt strike me as very smart but he may just be playing a role.
Tucker Carlson doesn‚Äôt seem to understand how age might affect your performance in the military whereas being LGBTQ might not.
Needed to see how much Fox prime would ignore Trump‚Äôs controversial remarks and whine and 'what-about‚Äô about the left. First hour was strong https://t.co/Pf92fo3rva
And after the break, Tucker will move on to the transgender military ban‚Ä¶. The other networks are still on, you know, today‚Äôs news.
And now Tucker Carlson is off Charlottesville &amp; the threat of the liberal left‚Ä¶ and on to a debate over DACA‚Ä¶.
Whataboutism is effective because it forces a debate about who is the greater aggressor‚Ä¶ which is better for Trump/Fox than running defense.
If I‚Äôm Trump I‚Äôm pretty pleased with Tucker Carlson‚Äôs coverage tonight. All about the sins of the left. Nothing about the alt-right.
Tucker now discussing the appropriate police response to liberal activists‚Ä¶		No discussion about racism, white supremacists, Trump‚Äôs remarks
RT @McFaul: OMG.  This is just pathetic. C'mon America ! Let's get ourselves back together.   We are better than this ! https://t.co/85XJBM‚Ä¶
‚ÄúWhat will [the left] feel empowered to destroy next?‚Äù ‚Äî Tucker Carlson
We‚Äôre halfway through Tucker Carlson, and 1/6th of the way through Fox News prime time‚Ä¶.. and it‚Äôs still all about the statues.
Tucker Carlson thinks America should get some credit for ending slavery around the world. His guest is speechless.
We‚Äôre now into our first round of Tucker-'what-about-ing'-over-someone-who-disagrees-with-him...
Tucker back w more about statues being torn down‚Ä¶mob violence‚Ä¶ liberals vs. free speech‚Ä¶		Not much about, you know, the white supremacists.
"Tucker Carlson is brought to you by Dr. Scholl‚Äôs pain-relieving orthotics."
Big Picture: Tucker Carlson is advancing Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù message ‚Äî this is all about sins of the far left, tearing down statues, etc.
John Daniel Davidson, senior correspondent for The Federalist, tells Tucker that people tearing down statues are like Weimar thugs, Taliban.
Shorter Tucker Carlson: The lesson of Charlottesville is that we need to protect our statues.
The important debate, Tucker Carlson says, isn‚Äôt about warring sides in Charlottesville, it‚Äôs about threat to American institutions, statues
Tucker going big on the fact that many of the signers of the Declaration of Independence owned slaves‚Ä¶. 		That‚Äôs the sound of well scraping
Tucker‚Äôs Thoughts: ‚ÄúSadly, Plato owned slaves. So did Mohammed‚Ä¶ Simon Bolivar‚Ä¶ The Cherokee‚Ä¶‚Äù all owned slaves!
Tucker Carlson‚Äôs focus: Trump‚Äôs remarks about which other statues might be torn down‚Ä¶ Thomas Jefferson? Theodore Roosevelt?		No, not joking.
At top of @TuckerCarlson‚Äôs show, @EdHenry acknowledges Trump remarks are problematic while also knocking media ‚Äúhysteria‚Äù
Think I‚Äôll pop a cold brew and live tweet tonight‚Äôs Fox News prime time coverage.
Timely. https://t.co/RscRwqyUkK
