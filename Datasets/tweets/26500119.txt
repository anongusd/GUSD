Final score: San Antonio Commanders 12, Birmingham Iron 11. This was a game of minor-league football at its finest.
Birmingham Iron's "on-side conversation" attempt is intercepted. This appears to be the game, but anything can happen here because this is AAF and it's pretty wacko.
@aafiron just scored its first touchdown of the game with 1:41 left after a ridiculous series of events involving multiple first downs inside the goal line on defensive penalties. San Antonio Commanders 12, Birmingham Iron 11 and now the "on-side conversation" attempt...
@MrcoEsquandolas @Qade_em Burial. Thank me later.
San Antonio Commanders 3, Birmingham Iron 0 2:18 1Q after a 21-play drive for the Commanders.
Birmingham Iron's first drives stalls but, wow, Iron punter Colton Schmidt pins San Antonio at their own one-yard line. Beginning to realize the separation between NFL special teamers and AAF special teamers isn't much...at least on this Iron team.
Birmingham Iron moving the ball well on its first drive of the game against San Antonio. QB Luis Perez with a smooth 19-yard pass to RB Trent Richardson for a first down.
Gotta hand it to these loyal fans for coming out on such a nasty day. There are dozens and dozens of people here at Legion Field for the Birmingham Iron's home game against the San Antonio Commanders.
Congrats, my friend. Can't wait to buy a copy. https://t.co/pkOIF5wdGQ
Just a reminder that Quinnen Williams' hands are even quicker than his feet.
Bring rain gear to Legion Field today if you're attending the Birmingham Iron's home game against San Antonio. Undefeated Iron is a 7.5-point favorite. Kickoff at 3 p.m. See you there.

LSU 29, Alabama 28 at halftime despite abysmal offensive start for the Tide. John Petty and Herb Jones playing well. Great to see.
Core group of Alabama players showing plenty of fight after falling behind LSU by 10. Alabama 28, LSU 27 with 50 seconds left in first half.
LSU 17, Alabama 10 11:37 1H. Alabama starters 1-10 from the field. Team is 3-13 with Herb Jones leading all scorers with two field goals and six points. Not the best.
Riley Norris in the game for the Alabama and the Tide immediately converts some hustle points.
Unbelievably weak call by the officials for allowing Marlon Taylor to remain in the game. Taylor literally threw an elbow at Petty's chin in transition.
LSU's Marlon Taylor should be ejected from the game. Took a swing at Petty.
Timeout Alabama. Someone give John Petty a cup of coffee.

Scary moment as Quinnen Williams drives Kyler Murray into the ground and takes off his helmet in the process. OU lineman then jumped on Quinnen to protect his quarterback, but I think he landed on Murray's head. Murray is up and appears to be OK.
Brilliant throw by Oklahoma QB Kyler Murray. Wow. Touchdown Sooners. This game is now interesting for the first time since the first quarter. Alabama 31, Oklahoma 20 3:03 3Q.
Heisman Trophy winner Kyler Murray is 9 of 20 passing for 149 yards with 5:06 left in the third quarter. He needs to lead a touchdown drive here or this game is over. Alabama 31, Oklahoma 13

With 21 points, Alabama has set a new all-time bowl record for points in a first quarter. Alabama's previous first-quarter bowl scoring record was 20 against Colorado in the 2007 Independence Bowl. 24 is the bowl record for points in any quarter.
Alabama 21, Oklahoma 0 1:33 1Q. Thanks for playing.
Tua, y'all.
Oklahoma punts 2, Oklahoma first downs 1
Tua changes the play at the line of scrimmage and throws a beautiful touchdown pass to Henry Ruggs in the back of the end zone. Alabama 14, Oklahoma 0 5:54 1Q. 		Tua is 6 of 6 passing for 108 yards through two possessions.
Why even have a playoff?

Oklahoma has done nothing well so far in this game. Awful defense, terrible offensive line and trash punt. Things aren't looking great for the casual college football fans out there.

FINAL: Auburn 75, UAB 71 in OT. What an amazing game.
Jared Harper, what a player.
My man is rocking the overtime fur coat here in Birmingham. https://t.co/vSvqoogbMf
HOLY HOLIDAYS! We got overtime! Auburn 63, UAB 63. What a final minute of regulation. Blazers just wouldn't go away. Nailed three 3-pointers in final minute to tie it.
@MikeSliveInvite attendance is 15,856 here at Birmingham's Legacy Arena. And IT'S SO LOUD. Auburn 47, UAB 47 7:56 2H.
OK, both Auburn and UAB assessed technical fouls there. Pearl was just a little more animated. This rivalry is fun.
Bruce Pearl just got a tech. He's screaming at UAB coach Rob Ehsan about something. Not sure what he's mad about. Probably losing. UAB 45, Auburn 38 11:56 2H.
We finally have signs of offense here at Legacy Arena. UAB 41, Auburn 38 after another three-pointer by Jalen Perry. He has 16 points.
UAB 36, Auburn 32 with 14:54 left in the 2H. Auburn going to the line after the first media timeout. UAB's Jalen Perry leads all scorers with 13 points.
UAB students are singing Christmas carols during the second half of the @MikeSliveInvite. Love it. UAB 32, Auburn 32 after a Jalen Perry three-pointer 17:32 2H.
@MGrayBham56 Not disagreeing with you.
The UAB fans complaining about the free-throw discrepancy watched a different first half than me. UAB didn't take a free throw, yeah, but they're also not penetrating or drawing contact.
@jackryanuab UAB isn't driving or drawing any contact. Just taking outside shots at the end of the shot clock.
Auburn 28, UAB 27 at halftime. First half couldn't have gone much better for UAB, which was a 20-point dog. Auburn shooting 33 percent (9 of 26) from the field. UAB shooting (12 of 30) 40 percent.
Jalen Perry with a 24-foot three-pointer to give UAB a 20-17 lead with 3:48 to play in the first half. UAB holding every possession until the final seconds of the shot clock.
UAB fans are clearly confused by the Blazers' strategy in this game. UAB has slowed this game down to a crawl (literally, the only way they can win), and people are heckling their own team/coach to take quicker shots. UAB 17, Auburn 17 5:29 1H.
UAB content with slowing down the pace of this game, and so far doing a pretty good job of it.
UAB 11, Auburn 10 11:50 1H. Both teams are 1 of 5 from three-point range.

@RollTideJT @aldotcom Local reaction compared to national reaction of this Durkin/Alabama story is pretty fascinating. Nationally, "Why is he even there? WTF" Locally, "He hasn't been hired!" Volunteer labor is the best kind, I guess.
@Guitar_Lefty @aldotcom Not disagreeing with you. I don't know anything about Maryland's football culture under Durkin, or how he or his staff motivated players. There is obviously a fine line there. I can speak to Alabama's culture. Competition for playing time pushes elite players to be their best.
@Guitar_Lefty @aldotcom I presented both sides fairly in the column. All you have to do is read it.
It's important to note here that Nick Saban released a statement about Durkin since this column was published clarifying Durkin's role in Tuscaloosa this month/week/fortnight as Alabama prepares for Oklahoma. Durkin apparently IS NOT GETTING PAID. It's good to be the king. https://t.co/wD0RKn9D8Y

Alabama left tackle Jonah Williams says pretty much everyone at Alabama has had the surgery Tua had on his ankle. "We call it a stitch job. They throw some wires in there."	👌👍
Easily the greatest answer to a question here in Atlanta for this college football awards thing goes to Washington State QB Gardner Minshew. If he wasn't a football player he would be a "cowboy."	Like a rodeo cowboy?	"I'm talking about 'Young Guns.' I want to be a regulator."
Kyler Murray of Oklahoma is here, and isn't he just a flowing fountain of information...I asked him his first impressions of Alabama, and he said, "They're a good team."	And anything else, Kyler?	"They're a good team."	👌👌👌👍👍👍
Quinnen Williams is great. Always joking around. He was asked who should win the Heisman Trophy, and he said he didn't have an opinion. So, I asked him if he should win it, and he said linemen don't get enough respect, and he would have liked an invite.

In crunch time, when it mattered most, Alabama freshman point guard Kira Lewis Jr. dribbles to the rim, draws defenders and finds Petty for the easy dunk. Excellent play. And now the defense is coming up big for Alabama. Alabama 70, Murray State 65 50 seconds left.
Ja Morant with 30 points against Alabama. Alabama having problems getting the ball across the timeline late in the game, which is obviously not ideal.
What a pass from Alabama's Herb Jones to John Petty. The dunk!
Alabama guard Dazon Ingram with five turnovers. Trying too hard with all the scouts in the building. Murray State has the best player (Ja Morant 26 points), but Alabama is clearly the better team. Should be a fun finish. Alabama 65, Murray State 59 3:51 2H.
Alabama forward Alex Reese has a really nice skill set. He's got nine points off the bench (3 of 4 from distance). Alabama 63, Murray State 59 4:37 2H.
@caskeyy I will be watching from Atlanta. Not sure if A.J. Erdely is the right answer at this point, but that's obviously a tough call to make for Bill Clark.

Smart initiative by UAB here, turning booster support into a competition. The goal: "To pass the total number of donors of each of our metropolitan peer institutions one-by-one. Building strength in numbers." Houston leads CUSA with 4,300 donors. UAB is far behind at 1,862. https://t.co/RwQEZNyUhi
Looks like Alabama is learning how to be a basketball team this season instead of learning how to defer. Nice to see. Nine players with points in this first half against Murray State and no one with more than six. Alabama 39, Murray State 29
Pearl the Bruce is making moves. https://t.co/Muw3YOTJnM
Excellent defense by Alabama until that transition three-pointer by Murray State. Murray State guard Ja Morant has a nice feel for the game, obviously.

Jarrett Stidham throws it up for grabs and Darius Slayton comes down with it for a 52-yard touchdown. Alabama 31, Auburn 21 3:31 3Q.
The Tua Show has started. Alabama 31, Auburn 14 9:49 3Q. Tua with a 33-yard pass to Josh Jacobs for his third passing touchdown of the game. He also has a rushing touchdown.

Auburn should just run Wildcat the rest of the game.
Alabama 17, Auburn 14 4:04 2Q after Ryan Davis' pass to Malik Miller for 23-yard touchdown.
Gus trick play! Touchdown Auburn!
Auburn's defense holds. Forces a rare three and out on Alabama. And Auburn's special teams comes through again. BLOCK! Auburn's special teams have been great all year.
Auburn has to get more out of its quarterback. Stidham is 4 of 14 for 36 yards. Can't blame Gus for everything.

Touchdown Alabama. Tua is carrying Alabama here in the first half. Alabama 14, Auburn 7 14:15 2Q. Tua is 9 of 12 for 76 yards passing, and has 28 yards rushing on two carries. Both key runs, one for a touchdown and one for an important third-down conversion.
Facemask penalty for Auburn's defense puts Alabama at the 15-yd line. So many mistakes by Auburn in this first quarter.
RT @ByCasagrande: Henry Ruggs gimpy jogging off the field.
Tua making it happen with his legs in this first quarter for Alabama. Excellent 21-yard run for a first down.
@derek_calvert Maybe you haven't watched Auburn this year. They haven't been very good.
That Auburn touchdown drive was 10 plays for 73 yards. Arguably the best offensive drive against Alabama's defense all year.
Beleaguered until today, Auburn's offense is making Alabama look mortal during this first quarter. Auburn 7, Alabama 7 2:37 1Q.
Touchdown Auburn. Wow. What an answer.
Auburn running back Boobee Whitlow is a very patient runner. He's moving the ball here behind an Auburn line that is getting some push against Alabama. And now another first down.
Auburn is actually moving the ball on the ground against Alabama here in the first quarter.
Tough running by Tua for the touchdown. Impressive. Lowers his head at the goal line and punches it in. Alabama 7, Auburn 0 6:38 1Q.
Tua finds Ruggs that time for a first down.
Henry Ruggs was wide open there for Alabama in the flat. Tua went for the home-run ball into double coverage. Tua is 2 of 5 passing. Stidham is 1 of 5.
Iron Bowl is getting crazy, but the bottom line is Auburn can't make these kind of mistakes and expect to stay in this game for long.
And now another drop by Auburn on 1st and 27. What a dramatic swing.
75-yard touchdown run by Auburn's Shivers comes back on a holding penalty, but Isaiah Buggs is coming off the field with an injury for Alabama. A lot just happened on that play.
Auburn forces Alabama to punt on its opening drive for just the second time this season.
Two throws for Stidham, and two drops by his receivers. I'd call it unbelievable, but we've seen this all year. Third-down throw is horrible and almost picked off. Auburn goes three and out.

@rtkeller_Ryan It's Iron Bowl week, my man. I'm in The Ham.
FINAL: No.1 Duke 78, No.8 Auburn 72 in semis of Maui Invitational. Duke played exceptional defense, and won it at the line. Duke free throws: 23 of 34. Auburn FT: 4 of 6. REPEAT: 23 free throws to 4.
@talisitider It's Twitter, man. Auburn is playing No.1 Duke.
This is an excellent second half for Auburn. Can they sustain this energy? Duke 64, Auburn 56 7:43 2H. Substandard shooting night for both teams.
Auburn burning some serious energy during this comeback. Duke 53, Auburn 45 12:59 2H.
Auburn scored!
I love Bruce Pearl. At halftime: "It might not look like much. It might look a little crazy. We take some shots, and we make some shots."
Embarrassing moment here for the refs calling the Auburn-Duke game. Foul obviously was not against Chuma Okeke, and they reviewed and overturned the call.
This Auburn team can score in a hurry. Back-to-back three-pointers by the Mighty Mites and it's Duke 35, Auburn 26 2:40 1H.
Duke basketball players doing free commercials for Maui Jim. That's generous of them.
Austin Wiley's going to be really, really good when he learns how to move his feet.
Pearl playing Wiley like he's on a minutes restriction.
Duke simply out hustling Auburn right now. That's a recipe for a blowout.

@CRigendorf I understand that's the general consensus among Alabama and SEC fans, and that's what is expected. BUT If Alabama loses to Auburn, it would be a worse loss than Oklahoma losing to Texas.
Iron Bowl always matters, but to your point, Auburn doesn't carry the same value this year. An AU win would potentially knock Alabama (and the SEC) out of the CFP this year. Of course, a two-SEC team CFP scenario is more likely. But, if Auburn wins, it would be seismic. https://t.co/eIANoUrqIH

What would be in a bar shot called "The Joe Burrow?"
What would be in the bar shot called "Alabama kicker?"
Alabama 16, LSU 0 at halftime. Feels like a lot more. Yardage is Alabama 325, LSU 67.
Tua has touchdown dimes, y'all.
Joe Burrow sacked at the one-yard line. Jennings with the blind-side sack. Ouch.
Tua's first interception of the season came on a wild throw downfield into double coverage. LSU will have the ball on its own 4 yard line. The interception came on 2 and 10.
And Tua has thrown his first pick of the year.
LSU videoboards showing Mizzou-UF highlights during TV timeout. They don't like the Gators here.
Tua's got sideline dimes, y'all.
LSU defense forces a 3rd and 15 on Alabama on third offensive series of the game. Alabama lines up and then calls a timeout b/c it was loud enough to cause a concussion.
LSU's offense seems hopelessly overmatched to start this game. A few people thought this might happen.
How does Grant Delpit stay in the game and Devin White is ejected?
RT @ByCasagrande: Total yards: Alabama 124, LSU 10.
Targeting call overturned on LSU strong safety Grant Delpit. Thank @jamescarville for that one, LSU.
Targeting call on Grant Delpit of LSU. This would obviously be big if he's ejected.
Touchdown, Alabama. Tua to Henry Ruggs III. Targeting on LSU after touchdown catch. Oh, my. Going to review...
Alabama made it to the 14-yard line. Got pushed back to the 30 and punted. Time for the Joe Burrow Show.
And LSU's defense is the first this season to hold Alabama's offense without a touchdown on its opening series. Was 8 for 8.
Two false start penalties in a row against Alabama. This place is so loud.
Tua hops up and jogs off.
Tua is hurt after a sack. There is a flag. This place is going crazy.
LSU's free safety is hurt on the first play of the game.
I couldn't hear the reporter sitting next to me. Then Tua completed his first pass.

@MattScalici Good road win against a highly ranked team.
UGA’s beat down of Kentucky is making LSU look a lot better.
@Bamawon17 I assume you’re an Alabama fan.
Same UGA color guy now theorizes that Kentucky’s defenders are questioning whether or not to quit playing football and end their careers after UGA scored a touchdown. This is radio gold, people.
Was listening to UGA radio broadcast (I know, but it’s fun). Fromm threw a deep pass, and the dude said show me who throws a better ball than that in the country...I wonder if they know how to pronounce Tagovailoa yet.
@JamesCarville probably thinks Saban called Sankey about this last play for Texas A&amp;M.
Touchdown Auburn. In two plays. Impressive stuff after so much disappointment inside Jordan-Hare this season. Auburn 28, Texas A&amp;M 24 1:41 4Q.
Auburn is going to have a chance here to either win or tie the game. Defense forced Aggies' offense into some bad mistakes there on that last TAMU drive.
Huge touchdown for Auburn. That was an impressive response for a team with some obvious problems, but still some pride left in the huddle. Texas A&amp;M 24, Auburn 21 5:14 4Q.
@RyanBrownWJOX The other guy quit the team.
Oh, Auburn. Incomplete-TFL-sack-punt. Six three-and-outs and the boos are audible on the TV broadcast.
Missed field goal by TAMU. Texas A&amp;M has given you a chance, Auburn. Watcha going to do? TAMU 24, Auburn 14 10:27 4Q.
It all makes sense now. He speaks at normal speed when he's screaming at players. That's his baseline. https://t.co/5GprVqJfYY
The attention to detail on Auburn's football team has been lacking all season. So many little mistakes in close games. It's frustrating as heck to watch.
True freshman DT Coynis Miller of Birmingham Jackson-Olin is in the game for Auburn. Made a nice stop, too.
Urban Meyer seems concerned.
@rlparker47 It was a bad call, but I think these refs have been conditioned by opposing coaches to look for anything against Auburn's DB based on how they defend receivers.
And yet another pass interference call bails out an opposing offense inside Jordan-Hare this season. Touchdown Texas A&amp;M. TAMU 24, Auburn 14 10:27 3Q.

@Robby_Joplin @aldotcom Alabama finished No.13 in the country the year before Mike Shula was fired. LSU finished No.20 the year before Les Miles was fired. Let's stop acting like Alabama was awful when Saban arrived.
What if I told you, Ed Orgeron would have a better conference record 13 games into his start at LSU than Saban's start at Alabama? It's true, and Alabama fans aren't happy about it. https://t.co/fdLi6vIEMb
What's more overrated?
Nick Saban says Devin White is "as good a linebacker as there is anywhere." Sick burn.
Time for my Monday morning All-Access live-chat. Is Ed Orgeron the coach to finally challenge Nick Saban for control of the SEC? Coach 'O' is doing everything right so far. https://t.co/fdLi6vIEMb

Hewitt-Trussville bus caravan on side of I-65 after game against Thompson. One of the buses apparently broke down.
Thompson intercepts a juggled reception by Ja’Varrius Johnson. That could be it.
Taulia answers Tyson with a 59-yd TD pass. Thompson 56, Hewitt 49 1:40. (70-yard, four-play drive). This is nuts. And now it’s raining. Get to ESPN2 now.
Paul Tyson (Paul Bryant’s great-grandson) leads Hewitt on another 80-yd drive to tie it. Some amazing throws. Hewitt 49, Thompson 49 3:24 4Q.
Hewitt-Trussville went for an onside kick with game tied 42-all. Didn’t recover. Put Taulia a lot closer to end zone. Thompson scored two plays later. Thompson 49, Hewitt 42 5:10 4Q.
Hewitt-Trussville answers Thompson with an 80-yd drive to tie it at 42-all 6:05 4Q. This game is wild.

There's a way for the SEC to still land two teams in the CFP, but Alabama would have to lose to LSU. I only bring this up b/c of all the LSU emails I've been receiving about collusion between Alabama and the SEC. One-loss Alabama would get in over everyone except Clemson and ND.

Auburn...wow. Fumble at the goal line after a long run by Boobee Whitlow. Miss State recovers in the end zone.
Jarrett Stidham is 6 of 10 passing for 38 yards. Malzahn would probably consider benching Stidham if he had a decent backup.
@ScottTurner_ Yeah...those tweets are not holding up at the moment.
Mississippi State 13, Auburn 3 at halftime. Auburn has 79 yards of total offense (38 passing, 41 rushing). How could the Tigers be this broken?
Mississippi State banks in a field goal off the upright to take a 6-3 lead with 10:13 left in the 2Q. Auburn currently has 59 yards of total offense, so every point counts tonight.
Mississippi State 3, Auburn 3 2:37 1Q. State's drive was nine plays and 67 yards. First signs of offense from either team.
Huge run right through the middle of Auburn's highly touted defense by Miss State QB Nick Fitzgerald. Miss State into the red zone.

Auburn kicker Anders Carlson drills a 47-yard field goal to give Auburn a 3-0 lead against Miss State. Score set up by an interception from Jeremiah Dinson and then nine yards of offense. Malzahn taking points where he can get them.

Good stuff from Arkansas in this first half. They're being upstaged by Alabama's offensive domination, but the Hogs have 220 yards of total offense and two touchdown passes. Alabama 28, Arkansas 14 6:09 2Q.
Arkansas now with more passing yards against Alabama in less than two quarters than Auburn allowed in its entire game against the Hogs.
That's 17 touchdown passes for Tua on the season. He's 7 of 8 passing for three touchdowns and 244 yards in the first half against Arkansas. Alabama 28, Arkansas 7.
Hope they check Najee Harris for a concession after that hit.
RT @ByCasagrande: Arkansas had everything going for itself. Then fumbles on the 2-foot line.
Arrogant play calling by Alabama costs them on fourth and 1 from their own 44-yard line. Alabama RB Damien Harris goes no where.
Auburn's defense held Arkansas to 149 yards passing (13 completions) for the game. Alabama's defense allowed 109 yards passing (12 completions) in the first quarter.
Alabama first quarter summary: the offensive stats are good, but Saban has something to complain about. Defense allowed 109 yards passing. Hogs quarterback Ty Storey is 12 of 17 passing.
Alabama 21, Arkansas 7 with 26 seconds left in 1Q. Nice drive by the Razorbacks, who are finding holes in Alabama's secondary.
Alabama 21, Arkansas 0 with 5:38 left in the 1Q. That drive featured Jalen Hurts at slot receiver one play and then quarterback the next.

@DanWolken The only thing separating a "great team from an elite team," or however Franklin put it, is the coach. That's it. That's college football in a nutshell.
Auburn's offense struggled against Southern Miss, and now there are key injuries along the O-line and at RB. This team has some quality pieces, but... https://t.co/GEElBqnzmU
I know Ohio State will probably blow this, but Urban Mothra vs Bamazilla might even interest people in San Francisco.
LSU just keeps getting better every week.
Auburn radio callers looking forward to next year. They’re 4-1 and ranked No.10.
Column from Auburn 24, Southern Miss 13 https://t.co/GEElBqnzmU
After narrowly avoiding disaster on a long a frustrating day, Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said consistency is the bottom line for improving his offense. Jarret Stidham has to step up in the pocket and running game must improve. No update on RB Boobee Whitlow.
The call stands. Southern Miss ball on its own 49 yd line. Down a score with 5:40 left.
Southern Miss recovers fumble on a sack of Jarrett Stidham. Play under review. This could be huge.
Golden Eagles with the ball and one score away from tying this game with 8:34 left. Auburn 21, Southern Miss 13. Auburn is flirting with disaster here.
Southern Miss receiver Quez Watkins wide open in the end zone for a touchdown. Don't go anywhere, folks. Auburn 21, Southern Miss 13 13:47 3Q. Auburn was favored by 30.
Florida must have wanted it more ...
Auburn punting yards 263	Auburn offensive yards 231	Auburn 14, Southern Miss 3 10:02 3Q
We're finally to halftime here at Jordan-Hare Stadium. Auburn 14, Southern Miss 3. Someone please put this game out of its misery. Auburn with 45 rushing yards and 63 penalty yards.
Auburn running back Boobee Whitlow is done for the night. Pads off as Tigers retake the field after loooooong lightning delay.
@KevinScarbinsky It's empty.
Another lightning delay at Jordan-Hare. At least 6:30 p.m. before restart. The first delay was at 4:14 p.m.
Georgia 38, Tennessee 12 in the fourth quarter. Make no mistake, this is a moral victory for the Volunteers.
Another lightning delay here at Jordan-Hare Stadium. So much for that rainbow. I feel like I'm back at the JCC outdoor pool with all these lightning delays.
@grahamcarr2 Not a bad idea.
We got a rainbow over Jordan-Hare Stadium. Hopefully a good omen.
More lightning here at Jordan-Hare. Looking at least a 5:30 restart now.
Big rain storm headed towards Jordan-Hare. Seek shelter.
Lightning detected at Jordan-Hare. Clearing the field. At least a 30-minute delay, which would put us restarting here at 4:45 p.m.
Just observed Dr. Andrews testing the left shoulder Auburn running back Boobee Whitlow and then signaling him to the on-field training table. Whitlow visibly upset.
Auburn 7, Southern Miss 3 12:51 2Q.
Auburn with 63 yards of total offense in the first quarter and 58 penalty yards. Three yards rushing.
RT @Rowe247: Ric Flair, folks... https://t.co/Y0icpjaVgf
Jarrett Stidham with a 46-yard touchdown pass to freshman receiver Seth Williams. Big sigh of relief here at Jordan-Hare after a slow start. Auburn 7, Southern Miss 0. Williams appears to be a big-time talent.
Auburn with 10 yards of offense and 30 yards of penalties with 5:19 left in first quarter against Southern Miss. So, not the best of starts here at Jordan-Hare.
Auburn with third-and-7 and a short field after its defense recovered a fumble in Southern Miss territory...Stidham drops back with all kinds of time but can't find a receiver...then, holding on Auburn. And now false start on the offense. Out of field goal range. Punt.
RT @tommydeas: Alabama student section https://t.co/11EwcVZhW5
Auburn goes three-and-out on its first offensive series against Southern Miss. Malzahn gave Jarrett Stidham a deep throw on the first play of the game to settle the QB down early, but he just missed Seth Williams.
Alabama 35, Louisiana 0. Jalen Hurts with five touchdown passes this season.
Just think about this for a second. Alabama is BY FAR the best team in the country, and when the team is up 28-0 in the second quarter it puts in a backup quarterback who is 26-2 as a starter and led them to back-to-back national championships.
Standing ovation for Jalen Hurts as he begins his first drive of the game. He's staying in Tuscaloosa, which was obvious weeks ago. I wrote about his sacrifice for this special Alabama team. https://t.co/fBpObyVYdI
Louisiana defender touched Tua. 15-yard penalty, obviously.
Louisiana got a first down!
Jaylen Waddle 63-yard punt return. Alabama has a punt block and a punt return on back-to-back drives by Louisiana. Alabama 21, Louisiana 8:02 1Q. This is ridiculous.
Dylan Moses got him with his helmet, sure, but you can't call that targeting. It was an open-field tackle on a runner trying to make a cut on a defender. Shouldn't even have been a penalty.
Waiting patiently for a giph of that Josh Jacobs stiff arm...

South Florida's Patrick Surtain (a true freshman) with a brilliant interception for Alabama. Tua goes right down the field and now Alabama can score again going into halftime.
Nick Saban finally has his Drew Brees. Yet another Tua touchdown pass. Just slicing up TAMU's defense. If Saban had a QB this good with the Dolphins, history would be a lot different. Tua: 16 of 18, 222 yds, 3 TDs. Alabama 28, A&amp;M 13 1:09 2Q.

Tua one-yd naked bootleg touchdown run. Alabama 14, Texas A&amp;M 7 45 seconds left in 1Q.
True freshman safety in for Texas A&amp;M now (Leon O'Neal Jr.). Good luck, kid.
TAMU safety Donovan Wilson ejected for targeting on that reception by Henry Ruggs over the middle.
Wide open touchdown pass for Texas A&amp;M. Mond to tight end to TE Jace Sternberger. LB Anfernee Jennings blew the coverage. That's a 99-yard touchdown drive for TAMU in Bryant-Denny Stadium. TAMU 7, Alabama 7 4:55 1Q.
Kellen Mond up the middle of Alabama's defense for 54 yards. TAMU at the Alabama 15.
Alabama receiver DeVonta Smith, who caught the national championship-winning touchdown against Georgia, was completely horizontal on that impossible touchdown catch. This team, man.
Last two plays...Diving interception by Mack Wilson, and then a diving touchdown catch by DeVonta Smith. Alabama 7, TAMU 0.

@DM_Pelliccio @BarrettSallee Who have they played? I simply stated the season starts now for Alabama. Saban said pretty much the same today in his news conference.
Saban on his team's schedule: "This is like climbing a mountain. The higher you go, the more challenging it gets." Alabama has outscored its first three opponents 170-28, so the Tide must still be below sea level.
Saban presser: Says Jalen Hurts has improved in the pocket. "There's no doubt about that." Says it has never been a question about his "arm talent."
Saban presser on right now...Alabama plays Texas A&amp;M on Sat...says it's important right now to block out voices and influences.

Column: LSU 22, Auburn 21 isn't going to get Gus Malzahn fired, and the loss isn't going to cost Auburn a shot at the CFP, but it's painfully obvious at this point that Auburn is paying a premium price for inconsistent coaching. https://t.co/P1qfJ3r9ZT
The question has to be asked at this point. Is #LSU coach Ed Orgeron a better coach than #Auburn coach Gus Malzahn? Because guess what ... #AuburnvsLSU https://t.co/P1qfJ3r9ZT
Auburn coach Gus Malzahn after 22-21 loss to LSU: “We got to be big boys."
FINAL: LSU 22, Auburn 21. A stunning loss for Auburn. Call it Ohfer Orgeron.
Auburn on life support.
@Matthew_E91 I think Coach O knew things were about to get out of hand, and he needed to try something.
Auburn 21, LSU 10 10:38 3Q. 55-yard drive after that failed punter jump pass by LSU. Highlight of that drive was a 33-yard wheel route to freshman running back Asa Martin. Martin was Mr. Football in Alabama last season.
LSU's punter threw this like he's left-handed. https://t.co/M59k3edB4C
LSU with the punter jump pass!
@trojanchad I see your point, but Tulane was favored.
Auburn strikes again. Now this is the team I was expecting to see today. Shaun Shivers with an excellent seven-yard run for a touchdown. Auburn 14, LSU 10 1:31 2Q.
Great balance by Auburn running back Shaun Shivers whether he stepped out of bounds or not. That play is under review. While we're waiting...Seth Williams 👀👀👀
Auburn is alive! Nice drive capped by a seven-yard TD drive from JaTarvious Whitlow. LSU 10, Auburn 7 5:06 2Q. Can we all agree now that Whitlow is the starting running back for this team?
LSU 10, Auburn 0 8:27 2Q with 33-yard field goal by Cole Tracy. Auburn feeling like paper Tigers right now. Need a score in a bad way. Too hot today for the defense to be on the field so much in the first half.

@ALREADYHOMELDO Got greedy. Feels like they're going to need the points in this game.
Auburn lucky to only be down 7-0 after the first quarter.
Troy with the upset of Nebraska, and now UAB with the upset of Tulane. Big day for Alabama's Group of 5 contingent.
FINAL: UAB 31, Tulane 24. Nice bounce-back victory for UAB after last week's loss to Coastal Carolina.
Auburn beginning its third drive of the game with 8:29 left in 1Q. Two yards of total offense so far.
Three-and-out for Auburn. Dropping passes all over the field.
LSU 7, Auburn 0 9:59 1Q. Worst possible start for Auburn. Stidham throws an interception on the second play of the game and LSU links together a drive to silence the crowd.
Jarrett Stidham throws an interception on Auburn's second play of the game. LSU with the short field. Terrible start here in Auburn.
That’s a wrap. https://t.co/b6FmYq5NPt

@sonofstevenson @undecidedtd LOL...the column was about how Auburn was about to get a lot better. Now, some Auburn fans didn't want to read that after losing to Oklahoma in the Sugar Bowl, but Auburn did get a lot better last season.

@sonofstevenson @undecidedtd Auburn's running game has to improve. Bottom line. How is this some kind of crazy take? Malzahn acknowledged it on Tuesday and said it was the team's biggest concern.

It had to be Tua. Jalen will get his this season, but Tua had to start.
Washington fumbles at the three-yard line on a botched pitch. Auburn recovers (Nick Coe). Can't tell which team is playing worse at this point.
That's another fumble for Jarrett Stidham. Two on the day. Carlson misses the 54-yard field goal attempt. Everyone is asleep at the stadium. Auburn 15, Washington 13 7:03 3Q.
