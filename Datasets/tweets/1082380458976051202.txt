The pain of losing a child to gun violence never goes away. I know ‚Äì it's that pain which drives me every day in my work to prevent gun violence.		Next week, we will take an important step as the House holds a vote on H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. https://t.co/2QTuEWnkaf

My heart is with the #Aurora community and the five families who now know the pain of losing a loved one to gun violence. I will continue to fight in Congress to #EndGunViolence and keep others from feeling the pain too many of us know too well. https://t.co/vnt5xknGUj
As we wait for details from #Aurora, our thoughts are with all who are waiting for news about their loved ones, and we send our thanks to the first responders.		But we know that we need more than thoughts and prayers to keep us safe. #EndGunViolence #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/Q62WXazJFJ
I haven‚Äôt been here long, but I know that Congress ‚Äì not the President ‚Äì has the power of the purse.		This #FakeEmergency declaration over a crisis that does not exist undermines our system of checks and balances and steals taxpayer funds that are meant to keep our nation safe.
