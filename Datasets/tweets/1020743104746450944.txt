@kilmeade @Judgenap @foxandfriends Some States &amp; Parishes don’t need a court system or DA’s office, they have a 1 stop shop, Attys, Judge, Jury, &amp;DA! somehow, after a stalling game with a victim, the criminals Atty shows up &amp;stares at the victim as she’s completing the police report for criminals with $ #circa1955
@kilmeade @Judgenap @foxandfriends Even if it was current in certain States &amp; Parishes the Law wouldn’t b enforce! Good ole boys club, 1 out of 4 men abuse &amp; think it’s ok.
