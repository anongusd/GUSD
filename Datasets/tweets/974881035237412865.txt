Not surprised. Cambridge Analytica appears to have compromised United States legislators. Entrapment? Blackmail? Compromised Congress people must come forward and expose perpetrators. Go out as a patriot. 😠 Not a coward or pawn to Putin/Kremlin or Mercer. https://t.co/bxzpF5GQh8
We’re pissed Democrats clueless they were being played. Clintons usually synonymous with first rate campaigns &amp; personnel. 2016 was different. They were late to recognize. Their hierarchy clueless waves of propaganda was an algorithm not an army of nerds.  https://t.co/9sz9lH79Cy

These numbers not inclusive of “secret donations” made by Cambridge Analytica and Putin Bots. Cambridge Data service from Facebook “stolen” swipes may be valued at over 100 million dollars. What’s the value of Putin bots to Trump campaign? Class Action Now https://t.co/2Nb7FQ7vRc
Did Cambridge Analytica, Bannon and Putin use these tactics on U.S. elected officials? Would explain why GOP leadership allows Trump incompetence and vulgarity to proceed unchecked. Our U.S. intelligence agencies have the answer to these questions. Release https://t.co/74qbNbkLub

If GOP Senators really support Mueller then insert Mueller protection provision in budget this week. That simple. Call the question on votes in advance. Have GOP show support before hand. Dems cannot be naive 2 believe GOP will cross Putin. Cambridge Analytica sets up pols. GOP? https://t.co/Xh9X9CD4IR
Where’s @SenateDems @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi on this? Votes on Spending bill last real leverage until November elections. Protecting Mueller is critical. Schumer needs to show leadership and balls by leveraging United Dem support in exchange 4 Mueller bill https://t.co/ph3FAHKlSL

Does everyone notice the obvious misogynistic culture that’s so pervasive with these pricks. GOP politicians, the 8 track tape of political universe. In woke community they’re done. Digital consulting was skilled but with no fucking moral compass. Yikes! https://t.co/Fy1yCMv6D7

Facebook data breach? Bullshit. Facebook conspiracy? More plausible. We’re the Democrats on this? Where’s the independent that wants Democrats to vote for him. This is where the rubber meets the road. Dem leaders grow a pair or step aside! Bernie speak up https://t.co/9yNHrYOjf4

Watch “Homeland” on showtime. It’s depiction of Russian active measures against America is chilling. Fictional interference? Don’t think so. Scenarios probably not too far from reality. Facebook regulated? Threat of regulatory oversight not moving needle.  https://t.co/MmFBeHohXU
