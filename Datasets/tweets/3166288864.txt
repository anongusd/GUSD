@ThatDaveBrown Yeah I think the issue is taking a RB that high (regardless of how insanely talented SB is) rather than explicitly not taking a QB at 2.
@ThatDaveBrown Denzel Ward, Bradley Chubb, etc. Or trade back to middle first round to get a QB. Look at all the ridiculous late-round RB talent the last three seasons...		Kamara, Mixon, Cook, Hunt, Royce Freeman, Lindsay (UDFA), Kerryon, Guice, etc. 		It's not a knock on SB at all.
@RyanMc23 Good evening Ryan. start 3 standard scoring: Ingram Ajayi Kerryon Lindsay, what say you?

@notcalee that was whatsapp yesterday
@25_male_nyc you aren‚Äôt often wrong my king, but he didn‚Äôt do it
@RDTBarstool Nope, you‚Äôre from Baltimore so you definitely support that. Baltimore gonna Baltimore.
@RDTBarstool I just find it hilarious that you cast judgment on a whole city when the city you rep has a racial history that pales in comparison. Guess that‚Äôs to be expected from a city that moved the Johnny U statue for a double murderer.
@RDTBarstool a handful of drunken idiots is worse than all that‚Äôs happened in Baltimore? Really? 		PS. I can play this game too		https://t.co/OpBNtywoO1		https://t.co/vUtrdkPq6x		https://t.co/n6mfpUz5N6
@RDTBarstool Ah yes, Baltimore, where slaves definitely weren‚Äôt once sold and definitely doesn‚Äôt have a long history of racial tension, riots, gun violence and police brutality, can for sure cast judgment on other cities for perceived racial slights. Mhm
@RDTBarstool didn‚Äôt your city have massive race riots just three years ago? I‚Äôll hang up and listen

@JosephSepulved7 @DemKennedy @HenriqueIsDaddy i'm only disputing the claim that he lost the american ppl. idk what ur trying to prove
@JosephSepulved7 @DemKennedy @HenriqueIsDaddy @BernieSanders meaning that about 1/4 people voted for HRC.  Hardly "losing the American ppl"
@JosephSepulved7 @DemKennedy @HenriqueIsDaddy @BernieSanders 66M actually

@dontwantone21 @fcukthisguy @Hillis3000 @JayEm_Aye @bomani_jones my original tweet?
@fcukthisguy @Hillis3000 @dontwantone21 @JayEm_Aye @bomani_jones my thoughts arent racist, ive criticized BB for spygate and his attitude
@Hillis3000 @dontwantone21 @JayEm_Aye @bomani_jones the whole reason he was talking about Tomlin was because of TB's comments...
@Hillis3000 @dontwantone21 @JayEm_Aye @bomani_jones you think Terry bradshaw from bumfuck louisiana doesn't have race on his mind? FOH
@JayEm_Aye @dontwantone21 @bomani_jones yes he very clearly insinuated it and if he didn't block me id quote the tweet for you
@dontwantone21 @Hillis3000 @JayEm_Aye @bomani_jones if thin skinned Bo didn't block me id quote that tweet
@Hillis3000 @dontwantone21 @JayEm_Aye @bomani_jones he doesn't have to use the words race, white, black, etc. to know what he's getting at
@dontwantone21 @JayEm_Aye @bomani_jones it's like these people don't follow Bomani
@Donwhitmore @dontwantone21 @bomani_jones what's the point of twitter then
sends his hundreds of thousands of followers on me over a civil disagreement and then blocks me. what a big man. https://t.co/Gfmo1mfvjZ
@Donwhitmore @dontwantone21 @bomani_jones not at all. just hard to keep up with hundreds of thousands of followers. not a victim at all.
@dontwantone21 @bomani_jones he sics his followers on anyone who disagrees. it's hard 2 have discourse when i can't even refresh mentions
@KevinRDuffy @dennisdoddcbs that's a scary thought
@bomani_jones @Squidrow_ i meant the treatment of the coaches by media and fans, obviously those three are the only steelers coaches
@bomani_jones not explicitly but that's clearly what you were intimating when comparing him to Noll and BC
@Squidrow_ @bomani_jones when doesn't Bomani talk about race? what do you think he's getting at comparing tomlin 2 Noll and Cowher?
RT @dennisdoddcbs: Would Randy Edsall be interested in coming back? Would UConn be interested in him? Asking for a friend.
@dennisdoddcbs @KevinRDuffy lmao you cannot be serious....Rangoon isn't qualified to coach D3
@bomani_jones Cowher never went on the field and tried to trip a player. more to do with class and character than race, Bo.

@N_GOD_WE_TRUST @Josh_Stirn thanks for everything. üê¢
@PardonMyTake I've got a cousin in Hare Krishna in California. No joke. DM
@MikeBatesSBN Im not the 1 incessantly whining about a satire website (more specifically its supporters). Do u take TheOnion @ face value 2?
@MikeBatesSBN Satirical Online Personality Accepts Job At Satirical Website. What a headline that must've been. I bet you boo comedians.
@MikeBatesSBN what's this then? Out of the blue criticism on a dead issue is starting the fight, buddy. https://t.co/KTiQnfeyec
@MikeBatesSBN indeed, but when said harassment is fictional, it is not your lane.
@MikeBatesSBN stay in your lane and stop your social justice crusade against BSS. Write about baseball. Stop starting fights.
@MikeBatesSBN perhaps thats the reason their blind intern @BlindMike_ has like 10x your followers. Stop being a whiner and stay in your lane
@StelliniTweets @ryanmassey yet neither of those come from you or BSS writers but you feel the need to constantly crusade against barstool
@StelliniTweets @ryanmassey your site humanizes serial rapists, barstool has supporters tweet mean things in a public forum.
@StelliniTweets @ryanmassey not bad but unfair and unjust things.
ARGUING OVER WHAT STOOLIES DO AND SAY ONLINE TO OTHER PEOPLE. HYPOCRITE SUPREME!!!!! @stoolpresidente @BarstoolBigCat @MikeBatesSBN
AND THE WORDS OF COMMENTERS/TWITTER TROLLS ARENT THE WORDS OF @stoolpresidente @BarstoolBigCat YET WERE RIGHT HERE  https://t.co/VlU0FFPvjZ
Nothing I like more than arguing w PC twidiots &amp; putting them in their place. Besides, that guy shld probably be @ a Bernie caucus rn anyway
at calling out barstool at every turn over JOKES. The false sense of self-righteousness is funnier than barstool!!! (not rly) @mikebatessbn
as your 12k words humanizing a serial rapist were, yet your network of sites is obsessively fixated  @mikebatessbn
What don't you people get? Do you protest comedians too? No joke ever made by Barstool comes close to how evil and damaging @mikebatessbn
There is a fucking difference between a purported news/journalism site and a fucking satirical comedy website.  @mikebatessbn
in your crusade against them. This is the double standard that is so glaring from SBN. Such a laughable position to take. @mikebatessbn
So bc you've talked about it = rectification? I know BSS writers have condemned commenters/twitter trolls yet you persist  @mikebatessbn
Remember that time your infallible site published 12k words defending a convicted serial rapist? Fuck barstool's tweets tho @MikeBatesSBN
you are definitely the type of softie libtard who cries every time you cum @JamieOGrady @PFTCommenter
.@owenags @barstoolbigcat who like to compete w each other over who can scream the loudest abt any perceived injustice. Laughable.
.@owenags @barstoolbigcat it's only a posse/clique of pseudo-intellectual Brooklyn coffee-shop type writers w large platforms &amp; loud voices
@owenags @BarstoolBigCat true, but again idk why BC, Dave, KFC, etc. get shit for what their "Stans" do. Such perverse &amp; backwards logic.
@owenags @barstoolbigcat I don't get why BSS gets crucified for their comment section yet sites like Youtube, PFT (ironically enough) don't
@owenags @barstoolbigcat yeah my bad. same team here. #viva
@barstoolbigcat @owenags yeah I read his tweet wrong. Trying to say you go after/codemn comment section. Will delete now.
