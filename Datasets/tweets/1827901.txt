@CPRBrundin @restabro @radiowest @CPRnews Now to be fair, Salt Lake used to have two thriving papers and real commercial radio news reporters to cover all the breaking stuff. Now I think public radio stations have to help fill the local news gap and don't feel they have the resources to do what we did
@restabro @CPRBrundin @radiowest Also helped that Scott Carrier was hanging around the station at the time.
@restabro @CPRBrundin @radiowest Well, Doug Fabrizio is a genius. But more importantly, we didn't have to spend time on an endless stream of spots, and web copy and tweets. Doug said: do great long-form radio and surprise me!

@cfarivar @VeeSimmonds I like wireless. But radio is such a nice word. Wiki: The term "radio" is derived from the Latin word "radius", meaning "spoke of a wheel, beam of light, ray".
@cfarivar @VeeSimmonds And by the way, why can't we in audio steal that Netflix feature where you can skip the credits and just watch the next show.
@cfarivar @VeeSimmonds When my kids watch shorter shows on Netflix, they call it "TV" so I think we can hold onto "radio". Maybe better, more convenient radio, but it would be a shame to lose such an awesome word.
@elisewho What's the deal with all the empty stands I see on TV?  Is it the cold?
@VeeSimmonds Weirdly, when I played radio stories for college students recently, a few would insist on calling them "short podcasts."
@VeeSimmonds For years, NPR told us we couldn't use the word "podcast" on Planet Money. Didn't want to link it to the iPod. We had to call it a "show."

@jaytwitface @realDonaldTrump I am not an economist, and I'm not sure which tariffs DT is referring to. Better to have everyone lower.
@ThePornstache I think of it this way. If you export, no tax. If you sell in US, just tax on profit. If you import, tax on everything.
@ThePornstache No problem. It's super complicated. If you sell abroad: no tax.  Check this https://t.co/dPTlHV7TN4
@jrsnbarn @planetmoney Under this plan, corporations can deduct their labor costs. So it mainly a tax on profits within the US
@ThePornstache  For US goods sold in US, the tax is just on the profits.  For imports, you have to pay the tax on the whole price.
@tbc0 @planetmoney @NASA True. Love those guys.
@cread @planetmoney Great idea. Weirdly VAT is resisted in America because it is too good. Raises so much money that govt grows bigger.
@chesterm8 @planetmoney You can deduct the cost of labor if you make it in America. If you import, you pay tax on the whole thing.
@prdoc9 @planetmoney Will bring in a trillion dollars over ten years. That's less than we get now.
@ThePornstache @planetmoney You can still make a hefty profit in America under this plan. If Boeing runs out of planes, they can make more.
@wintersong @planetmoney Oh yeah. You want to hold the currency that everyone else holds. Plus oil is sold in dollars worldwide.
@wintersong @planetmoney It would hurt everyone in US to not be reserve. But so far € and ¥ and £ have enough problems to keep us on top.
@STonySanchez @planetmoney It will still be cheaper to manufacture abroad, but it might be enough incentive to slow outsourcing. Maybe.
@danst0 @planetmoney We mentioned that customers would bear the cost.
@stlc8tr @planetmoney I assume we would not need their permission. Tax would be levied on US importers here in the US. They could retaliate.
@bt_hathaway @planetmoney @NPR And what about the countries that peg their currency to the dollar. Ouch.
@bt_hathaway @planetmoney @NPR We did not get to the effects on $ debt but it would be huge if the dollar gets that strong.
@patrickkeenanme @planetmoney I would assume there will be many things about this that will upset China.
@jnthngw @planetmoney Are you a tax lawyer? Perhaps you should be. I hadn't thought about fake exports to offshore shell companies.
@JCSimms @planetmoney The US importer would pay a hefty tax on the entire value.  The Brooklyn company would pay less tax. Just on profit.
@mdpresiado @jacobgoldstein @planetmoney As I understand it, yes. And commodities like oil.
@RobSmith_0 @Carberry182 We are all Rob Smith. Most of you just don't know it yet.
@bradrick @planetmoney @NPR It was too much to explain. Basically, more exports = foreign demand for $. More demand = higher price for $.
@BATConcerns @ophiesay @planetmoney Big question. How much will it appreciate and how fast. The idea is that it will stoke demand for $.

@joshwitten @planetmoney In theory, insurance should allow people to take risks and move beyond the basic, safe crops. But just a theory
@joshwitten @planetmoney Because at least a corn crop can feed your family. Carrot and green beans, not so much.
@joshwitten @planetmoney Yeah. I asked about the lack of variety in African crops. The researchers said that no one wants to risk it
@KayKezel @planetmoney @svaneksmith We figure Smiths are exempt from the "no relation" rule. There are millions of us.

@thenewlove @planetmoney If an indep. Scot using £ hit a recession, they'd be stuck. Like Greece under the €. No control over your fate.
