@linagato @VelezJuarbeJ @AskACurator Manatee! https://t.co/qPxeA01FCN
Q: What’s a weird thing you've found in your collections?		From Jann Vendetti: This South American megasnail (Megalobulimus oblongus) lays eggs (usually 2 at a time) that look like bird eggs! https://t.co/uGYBqxS7C3 https://t.co/EagSf0SWB1
@linagato @VelezJuarbeJ @AskACurator From Jann: 		Polymita picts tree snails from Cuba. Yes, we have them (see photos!) #AskACurator https://t.co/sDFIeS40nj
@linagato @VelezJuarbeJ @AskACurator From Jann: 		Hmm…as for molluscs, the entire group includes more than 125,000 species. As a comparison, there are about 5,000 mammals. The diversity of molluscs is amazing! #AskACurator
Seals, and walruses too, have lost the pinna which allows them to be more streamlined when swimming, therefore reducing some of the drag ears can cause. Loss of the pinna is a characteristic that we see in other marine mammals as well, like manatees, seacows, dolphins and whales. https://t.co/G15eyu9x9d
From nitzaspizzas: Why do sea lions have visible ears but seals don't?		Having visible ears (aka pinna) is a characteristic that pinnipeds inherited from their  terrestrial ancestors and that some species, like sea lions and fur seals, still retain. #AskACurator https://t.co/geeMCUMZse
For example, ocean acidification will affect organisms that build shells, which include some species that are part of the diet of some baleen whales. Marine mammals as a whole will be affected as the impact on shell-building organisms lead to changes in marine food web dynamics. https://t.co/0m9Ri6Ppoh
From yesi_se_puede: Is ocean acidification having any observable effects on marine mammals? I see people highlighting the damage to animals with shells, but nothing on mammals.		The biggest threat that ocean acidification poses on marine mammals is on their food. #AskACurator
Can a snail live without its shell? 		Nope. If a snail has a very damaged shell or is removed from its shell, it won’t survive. It is attached to its shell and can’t ever leave it while it is alive. It is similar to how a turtle is attached to its shell. #AskACurator https://t.co/Llc2DpUj9L
Are snails able to make sounds? 		They make sounds when they eat, but as far as scientists know, they don’t make sounds to communicate with each other. #AskACurator https://t.co/vePhMIIgUx
From evelintdesigns: Why are they so slimy?		Snail &amp; slugs have no legs, so slime allows the foot muscles of snails and slugs to move against a surface and slide along. Slime also has chemicals that make some slugs taste terrible to predators, so it can have other functions, too. https://t.co/JoUCT6pUQt
From seesawsee's 6 yo: Why do snails have eyes on stalks?		Most land snails -not all- have eyes on stalks. Most sea snails -but not all- don’t have eyes on stalks. Why? A combo of ancestry (what trait their ancestors had) + adaptation (how natural selection influenced this trait) https://t.co/XGJ1qKMOZA
From seesawsee's 6 yo: Why are octopuses so smart? 		Octopus need to be “problem solvers” regarding how they eat (they are predators) and where they live, so they’ve evolved to be “smart” as compared to some other molluscs (for example, clams). https://t.co/99i04JJPi4
From rustyrobot13: How about some info on carnivorous land mollusks? 		There are quite a few carnivorous land snails and slugs. They have an amazing radula (feeding/rasping “tongue”) when they are carnivorous. See here: https://t.co/qpqtiWdD28 #AskACurator https://t.co/KnqtdGdLvN
From sierra.nt: How do you preserve slugs? 		We put them in 80% to 95% ethanol or ethyl alcohol. This preserves the body tissues for dissection and also DNA in those tissues. https://t.co/7r4cqC3t0y
From pvphs2022: What are the true benefits of 🐌 slime? Do pharmaceutical companies use it?		Yes, “cosmeceuticals” are made with snail slime. It seems like it has properties that can keep skin moist. Better than other emollients? I don’t know. More info: https://t.co/9XNwLBXaT7 https://t.co/1S2MTATE1V
From queenj33: Can we get an interesting fun fact on banana slugs? 		Researchers have found that they can live up to seven years. That was a surprise to me! #AskACurator https://t.co/XflGZYTr6K
Snails with shells can pull their bodies into their shells to keep from drying out, but slugs cannot. They can’t regulate their body temperature other than moving their body to a more comfortable area. #AskACurator
From correabrianna: How do slugs keep themselves moist and how do they regulate body temperature? 		They have to keep themselves in environments that are damp and (usually) cool, otherwise they will dry out. #AskACurator
From maializzie: Why are slugs so cute? 		Most people don’t think so, but that’s great that you do! Maybe it is that their eyes are on stalks? That could be pretty cute. #AskACurator https://t.co/uHcpnAJoFq
From @travail4bio: Why do slugs have only 1 pneumostome? 		(For those who don’t know this term, the pneumostome is the respiratory or air hole on the right side of a slug.) They only need opening for air to move in and out of their body. #AskACurator
From @kiki_go_bwaah: Do slugs have organs? 		Yes. They have a digestive system and reproductive system, as well as eyes, a heart, and a brain and nervous system. Most of the organs that we have, slugs also have, or have a version of those organs. #AskACurator
From California, the banana slugs from northern and central California are the biggest. As for sea slugs, the largest sea slug in the world is found off of our southern California coast! It is called, the Black Sea Hare (Aplysia vaccaria). https://t.co/zeTg3qkdOu #AskACurator
From @sdgenny: What’s the biggest slug in the world?		For land-living slugs, Limax cinereoniger from Europe is the biggest and is about a foot long. #AskACurator

“10 years before the Olympics is a really good amount of time to get things done. We need to think intelligently about transit, landscape, and public spaces.” -@HawthorneCDOLA
“In our last election, we voted to help one another. We voted for schools, for parks, and for services for the homeless. We may be individualistic, but in the end we do the right thing for each other.” -Dan Rosenfeld
“The idea of a building that can adapt and change uses over time is key to sustainability.” -Dan Rosenfeld
“We need to move away from ‘monoculture,’ the idea that each space can only perform one function. We got rid of the single-use plastic bag, why not the single-use space?” -@MiaLehrer
“The Olympics are a performance. The city is a stage. The human activity that takes place is what makes it vital, and can elevate the stature of a city.” -Dan Rosenfeld
“The L.A. River and the Olympics are two huge blank slates that can support change and improvements within the city.” -@pattmlatimes
“Fragmentation of power fueled individual ambition. L.A. is a deeply tolerant city, but civic power is so divided that it’s hard to make a collective effort to improve public spaces.” -@HawthorneCDOLA
“Los Angeles has a lot of parkland, it’s just not located where people are. With changes to transportation, we can start connecting people to parks.” -@MiaLehrer

Thank you for tuning in to tonight’s discussion! And thank you to our wonderful speakers @AnitaDefrantz and @podairj, and (as always) the singular @pattmlatimes for moderating. https://t.co/uM4HKhVa5K
“Does having 2 football and baseball and basketball teams in Los Angeles diminish the passion of the fans?” / “No! Nothing fuels sports like rivalry.” 	-@pattmlatimes and @podairj https://t.co/8ozVFQAQiy
“Being there in person is so different from watching it on T.V. We could lose an entire generation of young athletes because their parents can’t afford to take them to sports games.” 	-@podairj
“Los Angeles could become THE sports city of the 21st century. The 2 main barriers are 1. Mass public transit and  2. Restrictive costs of attendance.” 	-@podairj
“The International Olympic Committee is an ideals-based movement. To inspire young people, to foster diversity, and to create opportunities.” -@AnitaDefrantz https://t.co/0j9xnGaUuB
“The @Dodgers wining the World Series In 1959 brought the city together. They became the premier L.A. sports team, and disparate communities banded together behind their love of the Dodgers.” -@podairj https://t.co/3q728X846a
“A sports culture is also a big deal. If you limit yourself to broadcasting just a few sports — baseball, football, soccer, basketball — you limit the opportunities and awareness for young people.” -@podairj
“Sports are so important for communities. Anyone can come in and be part of a team. Teams bring communities together and create opportunities. It’s crucial to foster sports opportunities for young athletes.” -@AnitaDefrantz https://t.co/voHYA4EUjB
“You could get into Dodger Stadium in 1978 for A DOLLAR FIFTY. A really good seat would cost you $3.50.” -@podairj ⚾️
“In the 1950’s the @Dodgers became a civic institution. The team was marketed to the entire Los Angeles community, including women, which was revolutionary for the time.” -@podairj https://t.co/pm6wwMnlHe
“The greatest benefit of hosting the Olympic Games is to the people. It’s a celebration of human excellence, and Angelenos love excellence. It’s perfect for our community.” -@AnitaDefrantz
2028 will mark L.A.’s 3rd time hosting the Olympic Games. “Over 1,500 Olympians live in L.A. We are READY.” -@AnitaDefrantz https://t.co/OgxkuOlqmv

@Ray__2017 The universe follows certain rules of math, and this includes biological organisms. Spirals are found all throughout nature.
@EdwardFleisch The "tall" one is Thatcheria mirabilis. The "flat" one is Architectonica perspectiva. (Japanese wonder shell and sundial shell.)

About .1% of the Malacology collection is on display. This collection alone has nearly 5 million specimens! 🐚 #AskACurator https://t.co/nTvq6UGmYn
Collection favorites? "Polymita land snails from Cuba. Look at these shells! They are otherworldly gorgeous." #AskACurator ✨ https://t.co/qzKPr0mBpj
Jann's coffee table? "It's a 400 myo fossil slab of extinct nautiloids. It's a reminder that molluscs are a very old group." #AskACurator https://t.co/gBBj6klxf9
Most exciting recent addition to the collection? Sandy the sinistral (left-"handed") snail! Lefty snails are *crazy* rare. #AskACurator 🐌 https://t.co/Rp3TGhOeVw

And that's the story of Sandy the snail. Carry on! https://t.co/luK3rAUQjk
And that's the other reason the name Sandy works so well -- it's a gender neutral name.
Oh, and have we mentioned that snails like this are hermaphrodites? They have both female and male genitalia.
It's a little like trying to shake hands with someone if you use your right hand, and they use their left. It just doesn't work very well. 😐
Snail genitalia are usually on the right, but Sandy's are on the left, so it's nearly impossible for Sandy to mate with another snail. ☹️
While Sandy is perfectly healthy aside from being a lefty, there is one big issue this snail is going to have... and that's reproducing. 😳
There are species of snails that are *all* lefties, but garden snails like these (Cornu aspersum) should have shells that point right. 👉
And yes, sinistral sounds a lot like sinister. Both come from a Latin word meaning “on the left side, unlucky, or inauspicious.”
The scientific term for being a lefty is "sinistral," so really this is Sandy, the sinistral snail.
Our Malacology Curator Jann Vendetti and Collections Manager Lindsey Groves have NEVER seen a lefty snail like this before! 👀
See how "left-handed" Sandy is a mirror image of these "right-handed" snails? This is incredibly rare! It almost never happens! ✋ 🤚 https://t.co/79omd5NVxQ
Sandy is named after Sanford Koufax, the L.A. Dodgers left-handed pitcher. ⚾️
(Btw, malacology is the study of molluscs like octopuses, squid, clams, snails, slugs, and more. It's a very broad group!) 🐌 🐚 🦑 🐙

#Hatshepsut was probably 16 yrs old when she became regent. She pays officials more to gather favor and ensure she keeps power. #NHMmummies
Cleopatra gets the closest to creating her own dynasty in Egypt, to rule without being attached to a man.  #NHMmummies
#Hatshepsut: ruled alongside child king, her nephew. Mystery surrounds why she declared herself king. Reigned alongside child for 22 yrs.
Sobeknofru: female king ruled Egypt for 4 years. First to formalize her power as king. #nhmmummies
Merneith: 1st dynasty queen. Buried as a king -- may have ruled on behalf of her son. Early example.
Ancient Egypt allowed more women into higher echelons of power than any other ancient society. #NHMmummies
