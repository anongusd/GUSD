@1AngryBlackGuy @magdra @spatial_anomaly @NualphaOmegam @Copmala This is basically my whole point "Sanders may be veering away from the establishment line, but he‚Äôs still far from being the ally many Palestinians look for in U.S. policymakers. "
@1AngryBlackGuy @magdra @spatial_anomaly @NualphaOmegam @Copmala https://t.co/3AFCA7UvCn
@1AngryBlackGuy @magdra @spatial_anomaly @NualphaOmegam @Copmala The Gaza part is a matter of interpretation, no avoiding it, the others are matters of fact.
@1AngryBlackGuy @magdra @spatial_anomaly @NualphaOmegam @Copmala Wouldn't go so far as to say he doesn't support Palestine. But maybe he does not, in any serious way. I'm pretty familiar with his record on it and do not know... just don't. At least better than every other candidate so given our choices makes it easier.
@1AngryBlackGuy @magdra @spatial_anomaly @NualphaOmegam @Copmala I would agree with this. Tbh I don't know that you can't support Israel to some extent and Palestine to some extent. I do think it's dumb to focus equally on their rights when only one's (Palestine's) are being consistently violated by the other. So no I don't like his messaging.
@1AngryBlackGuy @magdra @spatial_anomaly @NualphaOmegam @Copmala Maybe. Even in the worst interpretation he's better then every other potential Dem candidate on the issue. But he should be much better.
@1AngryBlackGuy @magdra @spatial_anomaly @NualphaOmegam @Copmala Yeah, not denying them. I've posted that he needs to support BDS, or at least stop ridiculously being critical of it.
@1AngryBlackGuy @magdra @spatial_anomaly @NualphaOmegam @Copmala The article on the F-16s does make me doubt his seriousness about dismantling that, since he must understand it would have to involve a loss of jobs. Which is depressing because no one else is serious about that, either.
@1AngryBlackGuy @magdra @spatial_anomaly @NualphaOmegam @Copmala He should support BDS (which I've posted a little about). Emphasizing that Israel has a right to exist is not something serious people disagree with. Thanks for sharing. I'd only add https://t.co/b4oZGjCLiV
@1AngryBlackGuy @magdra @spatial_anomaly @NualphaOmegam @Copmala But yeah he's probably more popular with whites within the party than he is generally
@1AngryBlackGuy @magdra @spatial_anomaly @NualphaOmegam @Copmala Here's a Gallup poll on his Dem favorables (78%) vs unfavorables (14%). Not broken down by race within the party, only generally, but since most PoC vote Dem, his general PoC favorables are presumably similar...

@1AngryBlackGuy @magdra @spatial_anomaly @NualphaOmegam @Copmala I've seen that and find it bad, though in keeping with the quote in the meme. It's the other claims I'm questioning. The two middle ones are probably about his voting affirmatively for expansive government appropriations bills that included war funding. He voted against Iraq war.

@1AngryBlackGuy I'm happy to have a legitimate disagreement, versus the gaslighting of other Kamala supporters. We can part ways here.
Finally honesty from #Kamala2020. Much improvement from the gaslighting. Wouldn't mind if all her supporters were like this. It's the dishonest gaslighting ones who piss me off. https://t.co/g8cTRKxFit
@1AngryBlackGuy @magdra @spatial_anomaly @NualphaOmegam @Copmala Or empathize...?
@1AngryBlackGuy "It's called accountability" is a tough on crime mindset, you do realize? The reform community does NOT see it that way. If you believe the stick is a legitimate way to deal with socioeconomic problems, then you might have no problem with this video. Reformers disagree.
@1AngryBlackGuy @magdra @spatial_anomaly @NualphaOmegam @Copmala That was how a class of his supporters were labeled by centrists. His other supporters who didn't fit the label were ignored. And the statistics about who his voters actually were don't reflect the image of the archetypal Bernie Bro at all.
@1AngryBlackGuy Get your kid to school or jail, the choice and threat is very explicit
@1AngryBlackGuy @magdra @spatial_anomaly @NualphaOmegam @Copmala Nah, I do not identify as a Bernie Bro, never have, never would, and don't know anyone who does... PoC here.

But that's why centrists call for it
@1AngryBlackGuy @spatial_anomaly @NualphaOmegam @Copmala You suggested Twitter should have banned the account that originally posted the Covington videos, that's what I'm referring to
@1AngryBlackGuy @spatial_anomaly @NualphaOmegam @Copmala Why on earth should they treat real accounts as bot accounts? You like them shutting down a record of a racist mob?

I'd like to know why they were suspended, given that Twitter has suspended the other viral anti-Kamala account, a several years old user who is a confirmed human.
@1AngryBlackGuy @spatial_anomaly @NualphaOmegam @Copmala So it's not even of importance to you whether Copmala was or was not a bot. Checks out. Piss poor analogy btw

@smullins3000 @JefferiesTuber @ENBrown @Popehat What is it, then? How is it different?
@smullins3000 @JefferiesTuber @ENBrown @Popehat The same I mean. The bill failed and consequently they did not have to wear body cams unless their local pd mandated it
@smullins3000 @JefferiesTuber @ENBrown @Popehat I have no idea if you're that. If I thought so tho, I wouldn't bother (that being said I'm a bit of a Bernie stan myself yet don't mind sharing bad things I've found about him, sometimes from Kamala stans who I do nooot like, but when they're right they're right). But yeah it is.
@smullins3000 @JefferiesTuber @ENBrown @Popehat aka let cops decide if they want to wear body cams. it's irrefutable and unambiguous. you can make excuses for her but that's the fact
@FeinbergUSA @NaomiAKlein @mehdirhasan okay thank you i did miss that. would be interested to know if excuses can be applied retroactively (they could not when i was in california public schools, but that was before 2013). i just remember from my time there that absences were cruelly never excused. so that's good. ty
@smullins3000 @JefferiesTuber @ENBrown @Popehat yeah she mandated it for the very small department of justice force and came out against it for the 80,000 local cops
@FeinbergUSA @NaomiAKlein @mehdirhasan Did you never go to public school? And if you did, did you not experience any of these things?

@INDIGOSKYY local agency body cam policies and implementation. Realizing the staffing, equipment and data storage costs, legal requirements, and policy decisions were much bigger than any legislator anticipated, those 2015 bills failed at the Capitol.
@INDIGOSKYY In the wake of the 2014 incident in Ferguson, Missouri the public and lawmaker interest in body worn camera use by local departments skyrocketed. That in turn caused several members of the California Legislature to introduce bills in 2015 that would have placed strict mandates on

@delkevis @Amy_in_Michigan @Purify_toast17 And as someone who's been active in prison abolition and seen what I've seen, prosecutors, or rather the things they do, are evil, straight up. I'm reading about her and she's just the same as the prosecutors in my home town. The idea of one becoming president is terrifying.
@delkevis @Amy_in_Michigan @Purify_toast17 At least, she had power to change it and did not. If it was to get along and thereby rise, however human the impulse to rise may be, it was at an unacceptable cost. And yes, keeping non violent offenders in jail longer, and innocents, while they were being used for slave labor.

@delkevis @Amy_in_Michigan @Purify_toast17 Slavery is legal, in the case of prisoners. 13th amendment: "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, EXCEPT as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States." Hence we have prison labor, i.e., prison slavery (1/2)

As top cop in California Kamala literally fought to enslave people (legally, but who cares). That's wayyy over the line for me and promises are irrelevant: would never make me trust.

@kortizart @GoldieAZ @blueherring32 @mtt_wgnr @joshorton @TomPerez Yeah, I looked up that video and was semi-surprised she was right. Not that surprised since it used to be mainstream white leftist view. But any strike against Bernie is neutralized by a same strike against every Dem candidate, particularly if we're taking eleven year old views.
@mtt_wgnr @kortizart @blueherring32 @GoldieAZ @joshorton @TomPerez I think I see what went wrong here. In person we could probably have figured this out in the time it took to write a tweet, and cheersd. We all think Linda's partisanship is akin to rooting for a sport's team. We just talked about it in varying degrees of coherence. Bernie 2020.
@GoldieAZ @joshorton @TomPerez Point taken. Way too much is at stake for me to even imagine caring.
