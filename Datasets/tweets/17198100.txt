cc: @DailyCaller Check out the thread. I ask Amazon's new #AI #Chatbot about prominent conservatives, the Republican Party, Dem Party, and your founder @TuckerCarlson The answers are funny, bizzare and biased as hell.
ANOTHER BUT PLS SEE PREV THREAD: Last night, live on air, I asked about @tuckercarlson. Instead telling me he as no degree (like @seanhannity @glennbeck) Alexa decided to make fun of Tucker. Interesting part here-- it’s not even dealing in facts, just childish behavior! https://t.co/3zQQ8vxpSU
RT @sethweathers: What does Amazon Alexa think of Republicans? Watch the videos in this thread to find out! https://t.co/t41jYbLYRz
@jeremynewberger Gets good auto pilot. Lights smoke.
Aaaand shameless plug--- if you have a sense of humor &amp; interest in politics, check out my book, DEMOCRAZY. Promise you’ll have a laugh and learn things about DC politics you never could have imagined. Thanks! Have a great new year!!! https://t.co/MVPRXdriqm -12/12
Sure, some answers are funny &amp; gave me a good laugh (yes, I am a Republican w a sense of humor...we exist!). It is important though to recognize that AI is only as good as the data put into it. The data will reflect those who are entering it-in this case college students.11/12
Remember some of these answers simply state facts. But of course, which facts you choose, even if true and seemingly mundane, skew perceptions and news stories in very specific ways. 10/12
Obviously, I only asked a few questions, all of which were related politically. They’re only a drop in the bucket of what I or we could ask. So, I’d encourage you. Fire away! Please share with me. 9/12
The AI program is called Alexa Prize. Amazon launched it a couple years ago, offering college students 500k to develop Alexa’s conversation skills. 8/12
I think it does bring up some serious concerns for the future of AI, as well as issues Amazon should address. It should be noted Amazon’s owner, Jeff Bezos, also owns the Washington Post. 7/12
Now, some background &amp; perspective. Among other things, I host a radio show here in Florida— political/cultural talk. We first did this live on air as a fun segment, having no idea what kind of answers we’d get. We’ll now ya have em! 6/12
Here is one of the stranger not-so-political, but instead more cultural Q &amp; As. I ask about @BarackObama  and Alexa tells me he’s white. 5/12 https://t.co/DvZdKf45Yx
Same here— a very specific choice. I ask about the Republican Party; the story is about Brett Kavanaugh. I also about Dems, and weirdly, it wants to talk about a Batman flick. 4/12 https://t.co/jC3z4JrpWA
When I ask about #RushLimbaugh the chatbot basically tries to convince me that @seanhannity @glennbeck &amp; Rush are not too bright. This is clearly a specific choice to fit a narrative. 3/12 https://t.co/fHFbiKBfG6

@politicobsessed No one – not even our elected members of Congress - know where the hell we are in the world. Even Lindsay Graham was shocked to learn  we had soldiers in Niger—- after they were killed. Reckless.
Is pulling out of Syria really against the Republican “base?” No. Both left and right around the country are realizing that American foreign policy for the past few decades has been horrific abroad and detrimental at home. It’s part of the reason some voted for Trump.

TRIPLE WTF? More (MORE THAN THE SENATE RACE) Broward voters cast ballots in the state’s agriculture commissioner, chief financial officer and attorney general races as well – a phenomenon seen in none of the other 66 counties.
WTF?! "Broward’s supervisor of elections, Brenda Snipes, won’t or can’t say how many ballots there are left to count." DOUBLE WTF?-Another problem: about 24,000 more people voted for governor than for U.S. Senate – even though the Senate race was at the top of the ballot https://t.co/L45L59HvxB
Reminiscent of @chrislhayes book Twilight of the Elites, no matter what happens in the #FloridaRecount, it only further cements the distrust we, D or R, have for American institutions, in this case dealing something especially sacred, your vote.
#FloridaRecount now: Senate &amp; Ag Commish. The Gov race now in threshold for Gillum to ask for a recount. Can’t imagine any reason he wouldn’t. TWIST: elec night, the R won. Now D leads. TWISTIER: military overseas votes are outstanding w 10-day grace period!

No longer will it be—We need to make some adjustments to Soc Security for the younger generation, like bump up retirement or do means testing. Instead—“Hey, taxpayer, paid into this all ur life? Well, now its gone. What r u gonna do, sue us in Washington?! Eff off!”
Democrats (and oftentimes Rs, but much more with Ds) won’t even discuss the overall budget being consumed by Soc Security, Medicare &amp; Medicaid. This path we are on, with neither party addressing it, has serious, and I think potentially violent, consequences.
Realize that for all the crap we hear about voting ONLY on PARTY LINES, Rs &amp; Ds consistently vote for misguided, naive, bloodthirsty, never ending WARS. Military $$ hogs half of discretionary. Rs turn a blind eye.  cc: @nickgillespie
