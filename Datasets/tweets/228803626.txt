@SenGillibrand I watch my friends all die around me from this shitty heroin that comes through the southern border. You are wrong! Last week here in Louisiana a mother of my friend who overdosed had to speak  at her son's funeral. SHUT UP! Seriously your words are garbage. We want a wall!
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Ok, First thing is you love to spin language towards your obvious slander tactic. What he means is he would rather have comprise from the left. A left wing that holds very little power in congress should be willing to make a deal in respect to the amount of power they hold...sad
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump You knew this was coming. NOT new. He warned congress this would happen since the first bill before dems took over. This is his 4th declaration of emergency I believe. You call it unlawful because you disagree. Maybe you should go to the border before you open your mouth.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Like healthcare? Forcing people to pay? They envision that one? You make stuff up and throw some fake love for our countries rules when it doesn't work in your favor. Everything he does you would be 1000000% behind if he had a D after his name. Go away swamp thing.

@jhanala12 @SenFeinstein You don't have the right to tell me what I'm allowed to own.  and my rights are not derived from a government that gives me rights.  The Authority is not granted by a government.  My authority is granted by my sovereignty.
@jhanala12 @SenFeinstein Yes I can, it's called individual sovereignty and freedom.  You created that label not me.  You claim it some type of military weapon not me.  What I own did not cause what happened.  This tweet leads on to the idea that something I own caused this.

@GoneGirl187 @SenFeinstein No I regurgitate what I observe.  Of course you need it to slander my position because it hurts your argument that there are responsible people with weapons.  Again what you claim are smart gun laws are stupid gun laws.  They would do nothing to prevent what happened.
@jhanala12 @SenFeinstein At what point are you going to need a permit for Chopsticks?
@jhanala12 @SenFeinstein Not gun owners that weren't there.  Not people who rightfully own guns whom you don't seem to believe should have them.  There are plenty of background checks.  This isn't something you can stop. A pipe bomber JUST proved gun bans won't work. BAN SPORKS NEXT PERHAPS???

@C_Murda17 @f480volt @DrBurpee @SenBobCasey I am for what's good for the country.  I don't agree that a market concerning immigration is part of the capitalist construct.  A country has borders. I believe that we could make it less difficult for people to come and create few doors for them to come through. Security.
@C_Murda17 @f480volt @DrBurpee @SenBobCasey No I am not an otamatone. It is simple.  If I tell the authorities are not going to pay my taxes.  They will come to the house with guns. If I resist they will by any means necessary incarcerate me or put me to death.  Good policy won't need guns to force people into paying.
@C_Murda17 @f480volt @DrBurpee @SenBobCasey They have to use guns to enforce it. Meaning the threat of violence is what keeps people paying their taxes.  And just because there are some who are complicit in paying taxes doesn't make it virtuous. It promotes violence.  It's unfair for people who work.

@OfficialSPGB @Nigel_Farage Also I have yet to meet a socialist who doesn't feel morally Superior or who doesn't tell you you're seeing things the wrong way or you're asking the wrong question.  Apologists of socialism usually attempt to make you smaller with your viewpoint. That's suttle authoritarianism
@OfficialSPGB @Nigel_Farage I don't claim to be educated.  I have read a few things about voluntaryism and the question you claim is missing sounds more libertarian than socialist.  I have yet to see socialism allow for freedom in any way shape or form.  You need tax dollars to pay for other people's stuff
@OfficialSPGB @Nigel_Farage You ever notice when socialism is applied and fails their apologists rush to claim it wasn't real?

Diversity without merit is worthless. Natural diversity whereby everyone has earned their position through hard work and unbreakable moral demeanor will be the end of racism.
Diversity is not a virtue.  If diversity happens through merit than it is worthy of great praise. Once merit is sidestepped and diversity is enforced into an environment deemed unbalanced, it becomes racist. Especially by those enforcing. Character, not pigmentation is a virtue
@fatcatmatty @Bros4T @jackiecy @charliekirk11 @VP @POTUS @nytimes And what the hell does government spending have to do with racism? What a fine piece of projection.

Politics no matter how distasteful is the barrier between having disagreement or violently ending your opponent.  Social media and big tech have a responsibility far greater than they realize. They, willingly or not are the public square. 1/3
Self appointed moral officer's will always be the first target in a civil war, soft or full blown. 3/3
Silencing voices of people you disagree with has been tested. Violence is the result. No matter how absurd the person you silence, martyrdom makes the village idiot a saint and worth defending. What Facebook, Google and Twitter suppresses only grows larger.  2/3
Democrats! 	Want to thrive and have longer holds of power? Accept America. Love the country that needs continual change. We have had such great atrocities. Not a single American aware of history disagrees. We are not deeply flawed by are past. We are molded by it, we grow.
The values of many on the left change only to benefit a goal.  A goal usually to preserve oneself.  @SenFeinsteins staff sent Ms Ford/@BrettKavanaugh to the mob alter because they want our rage to outweigh a tradition that protects everyone of us. Fear we well understand(3 of 3)
Democrats!	A person who aligns their personal ethics to a tested moral code will have true power.  Knowledge will be your array of ethics and wisdom will be a guide for making changes to values when the survival of many are at risk for the practice of a belief. (1 of 3)
A true progressive will still bind to values. Flexible and willing to evolve while maintaining honor. We know action based on emotions without a strict moral compass has a greater chance of imperfection. We know what a mob will do to the innocent.  (2 of 3)

Both the left and right have great accomplishments, failure as well. Our focus should be mending our differences not hyper fringe ideological warfare. This is what both sides truly want but there are some like big tech companies who are going about this the wrong way. #ShadowBan

@ryskisol @charliekirk11 I would say what reflects our core values as a family unit should also resonate with in our schools.  Schools that we have a choice in providing for our children.

@Steph_Lopez_66 @realDonaldTrump Your hatred as well as your ignorance have been noted.  I'm Puerto Rican and I'm Pro Trump.  Every group has radicals.  What you're doing solves nothing.  Except it puts more Republicans in office
@ryskisol @charliekirk11 We all have opinions.  As deep our need to look into ourselves is as deep as we need to look into the past. In my opinion that is what will solve many problems as they come forward.  But these issues will always come forward.
@ryskisol @charliekirk11 Well I would argue that the situation boils from the group down to the individual.  The closer you get to handling the individual the more specific your solution needs to be.  This is more in the realm of a  professional of which I do not claim to be.

@Jenlee2425Jen @ryskisol @MrsWo7 @charliekirk11 So I think the argument leans more towards what would incentivize people to remain in families?  I think it's also a question of Ethics between certain individuals who feel they need to remain in the family to take care of the children they put forth.
@danadg1 @ryskisol @MrsWo7 @charliekirk11 Now that's not a lot of real evidence but you can see in Japan, a strong family unit brings down homelessness. Japan virtually has almost none.  There is a sensible middle position between sex education and strength of the family
@danadg1 @ryskisol @MrsWo7 @charliekirk11 We have a lot of evidence to support that Family Values supersede sex education.  I'm not a fan of Mormonism however when you go to Utah in the Suburban areas you will notice the strength of the family.  Now all you need to do is see the economic position of Utah.

@amerebel6999 @MrsWo7 @ryskisol @charliekirk11 We need a system that is both sympathetic to culture while at the same time holding people accountable for the choices they make.  It would seem that the balance has been disrupted and there is more sympathy for culture then there is accountability.

@brycetache Well if you are comfortable that your statement is true, (which it isn't) you would harness enough confidence to be the machine yourself.  I actually love this great country. Dems are not ready to be in any position of leadership.
@delaphenaj @SenSanders No and I'm glad I don't. I'm supposed to challenge myself and earn those things for myself. Nobody owes me anything and I don't want you using a government to steal from others to give to me.  It's not virtuous just because you have authority.

@dpwallace56 @JessicaTarlov Artists are people that look at something and make it better. That's the makings of a leader. Those that blindly follow rules are slaves.

@SocialismBC I think from what I observe. What you supposedly promote hasn't happened yet except for what history says about socialism.
@SocialismBC https://t.co/JxbGWPbzUz	Which is superior to what you have shown.
@SocialismBC oppressing people magically ends with a socialist society? Umm...Can you please define the acronym Nazi or are you scared too?

@SocialismBC https://t.co/Dn4ocWx7qE
@SocialismBC you called people pathetic not me. I'm just asking
@SocialismBC oh, I thought people were more dynamic than that. Interesting. Please tell me more about myself.  What my phone number?
@SocialismBC why would you want pathetic people equalized with you?
@SocialismBC https://t.co/cHqj3ngzWt	A carpenter/janitor whom solved open heart surgery amongst a racist society. Cause janitors suck.
@SocialismBC  saying I'm lazy without having any information on me is very condescending. You would equalize people you think are pathetic?
@SocialismBC Janitorial work is a great place to start for many aspiring to be great. Who chooses what is great? You?
@SocialismBC Lol child? Slander is the tool of the loser in a debate. Socrates dude!
@SocialismBC I am only oppressed by my unwillingness to compete against myself, others and desire to be better in what I love to do.
@SocialismBC then you seek anarcho-capitalism not socialism
@SocialismBC @FlaxeLaxen wow, if you truly want freedom you would support individual sovereignty. You suppress capitalists
@realDonaldTrump Let Donald be Donald. Because in the end no matter what you do you will have haters that just hate for hates sake. Sad...
@MikeElgan @realDonaldTrump nothing good will ever come from him even if he solves World Peace we must be against him

@FlaxeLaxen @SocialismBC also please explain the value of money.
@POTUS We do not agree on many issues. I have to thank you however for saying that the majority of us are good, because we are Sir.
@SirPatStew I also want to thank you for being a big part of my youth.  Watching star trek is something I will never forget.
@SirPatStew Sir, I want to say that I am such a fan of your work.  Ideologically it would appear we do not agree. Love your work anyways.
@SocialismBC I am not concerned with what is Democratic.  We are a constitutional republic which is different.
@FlaxeLaxen @SocialismBC sure. I compete against myself in many ways.  What's wrong with someone being better than you in a labor sense?
@SenSanders OK Mr. Sanders! Solutions.  Even though I disagree I must applaud you for this.  Great stuff!
@SocialismBC Aren't socialist activists better than capitalist activists? Isn't that ideological competition?
@SocialismBC or are there just good cooks?
@SocialismBC I never believe I am better than another.  However I know nothing about cooking and there are better cooks than I.
@SocialismBC so being better than the next guy at my job is bad? Sounds like you want to remove challenging yourself.Doesn't sound good.
@TheDemocrats oh please.  If you want to beat Republicans you hold them to their own morals.  Because you have none while you write laws.
@rjcc @RobSchneider The problem with granting criticism to only one group is the echo chamber it creates.  We all live here with each other.
@OfficialSPGB @realDonaldTrump 		Ignore what is good and distract with untruth.
@SocialismBC @amedeofelix again, a way to have no respect for acquiring resources.  To want capitalism gone is to remove competition.
@RealJamesNight @nikki199x @derrickgibson35 @FoxNews It is far better to insult people publicly than to do so behind our backs.  #Wikileaks
@SenSanders Mr. Sanders. Please, when dictating a problem can you show a solution also.  That would be helpful to your cause.
@SenSanders Equalizing results without equal chance of labor depresses minorities.
@SenSanders What's the plan then? More goodies? Many become better at their jobs.  Who gets better at collecting benefits?
@RealJamesNight @nikki199x @derrickgibson35 @FoxNews No. It's anyone that isn't result based that criticizes him unjustly. Focus on jobs...

@amedeofelix false socialism is about equalizing money without fair labor.  You want equal results without equal participants.

@SenSanders Make a jobs environment where it's affordable. Stop stealing from people to pay for things and make better jobs for us priority.
@SenSanders Programs you need threats to collect money for.  Make an environment where programs are affordable not stolen from groups.
@tonyposnanski @realDonaldTrump and that made the vote so fair.  never forget that la and new york should not choose our president
@oreillyfactor You and @TuckerCarlson are my favorites on fox. I especially love when you are contested and respond. Excellence
@Fusion @realDonaldTrump At some point we need to have a government that helps us help ourselves.Not steal from one group to give to another
@jules_su @realDonaldTrump we don't need candy from the donkey van. We need jobs to pay for health care ourselves. We want choices.
@greta that is a beautiful heriz rug also

@OfficialSPGB you mean, competition. Because you feel no respect for the acquisition of resources? Or somehow the rich stole the money?
@TheDemocrats never forget LBJ gave entitlements to maintain vote plantations.  Focus on jobs, quit offering goodies from your donkey van.
