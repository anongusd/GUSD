@maggieNYT Many key lines from Cohen. America needs to have a personal insight about their president and he knows the man very well....each new insight is chilling.
@markknoller Wow, what a waste. This was such a farce. DT is not happy with the GOP members. He met with his Russian buddies and I wonder how much dirt he now has to intimidate. This meeting was a PR move to begin with that‚Äôs why he could high tail and run.
@EricHolder This is what I have been saying. If DT is a fraud and became president because he cheated for the lack of a better word. Then is his appointments of the Supreme Court Judges null and void or any legislation???
