@steve_g2 To be fair a few far right tuned out rep senators, so maybe those will be cancelled out, and get centrists like Baucus, DeMint
@steve_g2 true.  Sanders, not dem. Boxer, Feinstein, Feingold, Burris, Franken (senate may sober him), others not rad - just old school dems
@steve_g2 I have to admit, you have a good dem senator.  The senate needs more like Bayh, he is a good one.  He is old school, not radical.
@steve_g2 I didn't know there were lefties in Chesteron, I went to Chesterton for my senior year.  How is biz up there?
