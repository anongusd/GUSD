Only viable political solution for Syria is 1 w/out Asad; partnering w/ regime wld not only be wrong, but dangerous b/c wld strengthen ISIL
Syrian heroes: when electricity goes out in underground clinic, doc operates by cell phone light to save boy wounded by regime barrel bomb

#POTUS @emkinstitute: Sens Kennedy &amp; Hatch showed, we can unite on some things &amp; those ‘some things’ can mean EVERYTHING to some.
#Nigeria's largely peaceful vote welcome, but rprts of pol interference in count process. People's will must be respected &amp; not distorted.
"Here a woman challenged a man and defended Islam." And for that, Farkhunda was lynched. Heartbreaking story: http://t.co/6bWUMoRYFe
Long awaited day in my hometown as @emkinstitute opens. Remembering the giant Teddy Kennedy &amp; his unrelenting fight for justice
Thoughts w/ people of #Nigeria ahead of critical elections tomorrow. Encourage everyone to work toward peaceful outcome &amp; reject violence.
Strong warning from SYG to Nkurunziza today: Consider carefully potent'l consequences of elections decisions—both for Burundi &amp; your legacy.
Deeply concerning. Several sacked from #Burundi ruling party after urging Nkurunziza to abandon quest for third term.
Watch the opening of today's unprecedented gathering of world's military leaders for today's #DefenceChiefsMeeting http://t.co/lBGaFrXTeA

When #Libya's #HumanRights defenders' vital voices are silenced, all of Libyan society loses out &amp; fundamental freedoms are eroded.

Progress is being made. Just today, #Thailand's biggest seafood company cut ties with a supplier found to traffic workers.
Eliminating trafficking from supply chains is an Admin priority; USG cooperating w/ private sector &amp; NGOs to improve http://t.co/r7myKiIvaA
Over 100 countries have passed anti-trafficking laws. Good start, but prosecutions and services for victims are true test of progress.
Today, met Sens @amyklobuchar @KellyAyotte @SenatorHeitkamp @SenatorCollins @maziehirono @SenWarren @SenStabenow on ending #HumanTrafficking

Important time in Afghanistan as unity gov takes shape; end of U.S. combat mission; &amp; start of historic new chapter between our countries
“Basic education must reach all Afghan girls,” .@ashrafghani said. Also access to economic opportunities #LetGirlsLearn.
Key point in .@ashrafghani speech: We respect/honor our wives and mothers. But big difference between modesty and marginalization.
.@ashrafghani: Afghan maternal mortality rates high, but women no longer more likely to die from child birth than combat.
.@ashrafghani: In 2002, avg life expectancy for “ordinary Afghan was 44 years.” Today, because of US-built clinics/hospitals, it is over 60.
.@ashrafghani: “On September 10, 2001, there were no girls enrolled in school in Afghanistan.” Today, more than 3 million getting education.
Attended Afghan President @ashrafghani 's speech to Joint Meeting of Congress today. Powerful words &amp; bipartisan atmosphere.

Vote in 5th Committee targets SG authority &amp; LGBT families at UN. We owe global public servants a debt of thanks, not to deny them rights
UN’s management committee votes to preserve SG’s admin prerogatives under the UN Charter, allowing UN to keep deciding staff benefits.
UN just voted down Russian proposal to deny UN Secretary General of administrative authority &amp; strip benefits from UN staff LGBT families.
Important: #UN about to vote on Russian res, which wld undermine the Secretary General, set back human rts &amp; hurt UN families
.@UNICEF rprts Cobra Faction rebel grp in S.Sudan released 250 child soldiers–incl 4 girls; one as yng as 9. ~3k still held. Need all freed.

#Yemen crisis can be solved, but needs all Yemeni parties to invest in peaceful pol transition&amp;put ppl 1st. My stmt: http://t.co/m2FM4gukKM
61% of Yemenis need humanitarian aid. It's the ppl who continue to pay highest price for violence &amp; instability fueled by Houthi behavior.
#UNSC spoke w/ 1 voice in support of President Hadi, Yemen's legitimate elected leader. All parties must commit to UN-brokered negotiations.
#UNSC just held emergency session on Yemen. Attacks by Houthis &amp; forces under frmr prez Salih jeopardize pol transition. Must halt violence.
If China is committed to advncng rights of women, it should work to address issues raised by these women—not silence them #FreeBeijing20Five
At #CSW59, China announced it would co-host Sept Summit on Women at #UNGA, even while it refuses to #FreeBeijing20Five.
As #CSW59 ends, remain concerned abt cont'd detention of 5 Chinese women activists. #FreeBeijing20Five My statement: http://t.co/3hzJZt5H0s
Suicide bombs at #Yemen mosques kill ~130 people. Situation in country continues to be dire; urgency on political talks as vital as ever.
3/3 Asad regime is only power with helos. Reports again are that gas attack came from the air. If it flies like a duck…
2/3 This is why #UNSC passed res affirming the weaponization of chlorine as viol of CWC&amp;UN res. Long past time for attribution&amp;consequences
1/3 Reports and video out of #Syria utterly horrific. Civilians, including kids, victims of an apparent chlorine gas attack.
#UN HR report also suggests Gov of Iraq forces &amp; militias may have committed war crimes. Govt must hold anybody responsible to account.
#UN HR report details #ISIL atrocities: rapes of girls young as 6; boys forced to soldier; targeting Yezidis, Christians &amp; ethnic groups.

Today, @VP phoned Nigerian Pres. Jonathan &amp; oppo candidate Buhari-vital elections are nonviolent. Leaders shld ask same of their supporters.
On 3/28 Nigeria votes. Critical to stick to election sched &amp; for all pol leaders, security services to promote free, fair, credible polls.
Museum attack in #Tunisia kills ~20 tourists. Security forces acted quickly&amp; prevented even worse. Hearts are w. Tunisia &amp; victims’ families
In July 1995 (when I was a reporter in Bosnia) it seemed utterly unthinkable that the perps wld eventually be held accountable. cc: Assad
20 yrs after the genocide at Srebrenica, Serbia arrests 8 in connection with the slaughter. Major step toward accountability &amp; justice.
Glad to see Houthi free fmr Yemen PM (&amp; my fmr UN colleague) Bahah. Good man unjustly treated. Overall situation still alarming

Moving words frm @OutVet mbr in @nytimes; said grp marched in Boston's parade 4 all closeted LGBT who'd served in mil http://t.co/zNMx76QrQy
On this #StPatricksDay, as Bostonian &amp; Irish-American, v. proud LGBT grps joined their historic 1st StPats parade this past Sun in Beantown.
Celebrated StPats Day w/ my team at @USUN: a.m. pastries w/ coffee...not Guinness, still a few hrs too early for that.
US rejects Russia's attempted "annexation" of Crimea. Sanctions related to Crimea will remain in place as long as the occupation continues.
Cynical Russian attempts to validate theft of Crimea ignores intn'l law, historic record &amp; fact that rights situation deteriorating rapidly.
On 1-yr annivrs'y of sham "referendum" in Crimea, reiterating what UN members overwhelmingly made clear: Crimea was &amp; is a part of #Ukraine.
Thoughts w/ Vanuatu, where Cat5 cyclone caused extensive damage. @TheOFDA responding thru RedCross, USG staff on ground to assess damage.
Disturbing recent #UNAMA report on treatment of #Afghanistan detainees, but important that Pres. Ghani has vowed to eliminate torture.
(2/2) Yet positive signs in #Afghanistan too: Here's a simple, but powerful one—story of women's nat'l cycling team http://t.co/jYVxCEkmEU
(1/2) Both key advances &amp; ongoing challenges in #Afghanistan. Civilian casualties up 22% in 2014. 75 percent by Taliban &amp; affiliates
Renewal of UN Afghan mission today signals commitment to country's people &amp; efforts to build democracy. My remarks: http://t.co/EADGIsEWGr
#Russia still maintaining trumped up charges against Nadiya Savchenko, who should be freed. #Ukraine #FreeNadiya
Good news out of #Russia—Baseless charges against Svetlana Davydova, a mother of 7, have been dropped.
Remarkable news: @Pontifex will visit CAR in Nov. In a place where people lynched on basis of religion, visit cld be huge for reconciliation
Heard concerns about increased politicization in Burundi schools. 10-13 y.o. kids say they need to be ruling party loyalist to secure future
US position on Arusha Accords clear. Text says "No one may serve more than 2 presidential terms." Term limits help reinvigorate democracies.
Met Pierre Claver Mbonimpa. Told him how we respect his human rights work. Glad he's out of jail when Burundi needs him most.
On elections, many Burundians told us they fear that president seeking 3rd term will lead to violence. Asked prez to prioritize unity/peace.
Spent day in Burundi. Told Pres. Nkurunziza that frightened Muslim pop in CAR's PK5 praised Burundian peacekeepers for strong protection.
Applaud AU efforts in #Somalia. Improving security, promote post-conflict reconstruction &amp; weaken al-Shabaab. US &amp; #UNSC supports AU in this

Chinese authorities should immediately release “Beijing+20 five.” Sad reflection on “women’s rights are human rights.” #FreeBeijing20Five
In China speaking out against sexual harassment is “creating a disturbance.” Disturbance is restricting NGOs fighting for universal rights.
