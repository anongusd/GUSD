@amjoyshow @matthewamiller No matter hw hard you try to discredit Trump, He keeps standing tall above you and all democrats combined.
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump He's going to survive it. Keep watching. Trump is a survivor.
@EdKrassen Photoshopped!
@amjoyshow @ElieNYC Indict him then, Joy. If you've the balls, go ahead but be assured that Trump will leave in 2024 and by then, I'm quite certain you'd be shedding blood.
@amjoyshow @RWPUSA Joy, if you think Trump would resign, I bet you'd think unicorns are real. TRUMP is CHAOS! He thrives in chaos. The president will fight democrats with the last drop of his blood for plotting to unseat him. It'd would not work. Dems window opens in 2020. Let them wait!

@krassenstein Hey! You can only dream. It's not happening!
@immigrationcom @ChuckGrassley Obama criticised the judgement made by the judge so he invariably skewered the judge. Common sense.
@EdKrassen Do not be fooled by these packages sent. D entire thing stinks. D Democrats encourage do &amp; sent out mobs 2 harass any1 who dos nt conform 2 their policies or agenda. This S backfiring on them. So what do they do? They mak themselves "victims" by sending themselves these packages.
@EdKrassen Diversion tactic by democrat 2 blame republicans &amp; divert attention from d southern invasion that they won’t acknowledge or talk about! They r looking 2 play d victim! Sending d packages themselves! I am sure they have cameras &amp; security &amp; a nice big WALL around their property!
@EdKrassen Terrorist acts are carried out as an act of desperation. Not when winning. Republicans are winning at every turn so it's pretty unlikely any republican did it. It's more likely Democrats set it up in an attempt to prove that republicans are as unhinged as Democrats.
@EdKrassen I find it amazing that the packages were processed at mail facilities yet have no markings indicating that they were ever at any mail center (no postmarks, stamps proving processing, etc)?
@EdKrassen Everybody knows a pipe bomb in the mail is going to be intercepted before it makes it to a high ranking official in today's world. I SMELL A STRATEGICALLY TIMED RAT.

@EdKrassen Your replies to Trump doesn't show up at the top because of "likes" but notification. You activated your notification for first responders to Trump tweets because Trump is the financial oxygen you need to survive, isnt he? We know you are probably paid for this propaganda!
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Like you are in the Mueller team. Fact is Mueller will go just as he came but Trump will remain your president till 2024 and there's nothing you nor anyone will do about it. Trump will still rule this country. We in US need a brave and strong man like Trump to lead us.
@EdKrassen No. It'd be the day of reckoning for Rosenstein.
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Ed krassenstein, you mean real victims like Dr. Ford Blasey?
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Yes, they are.
@EdKrassen Twitter being filled with leftist narratives doesn't translate to facebook infiltration with Russian narratives which of course is leftist political slogan against current administration. It's all a futile propaganda called the 'resistance movement'.
@GrayingApostate @EdKrassen Why did you leave facebook?
@EdKrassen Another political hit job. Someone should check his account. He must have been paid to lie knowing it'd likely ingrain their talking point.
@EdKrassen @amazon Finally a fresh breath from Amazon.
@EdKrassen The steele dossier is a politically fabricated document aimed at undermining the legitimacy of Trump administration and his decimation of democrats in 2016 election.
@kurtbardella @tedlieu There's nothing to picture except a broken man who was emotionally traumatised by the lies hurled at him by political opponents of Trump and those who hate his guts.
@K_JeanPierre @nbc Hey, talk is cheap. Anyone can say that. Anyone. Just their word against his. Nothing more.
@krassenstein Another ragtag conjectures by democrats in their conceited effort to stop kavanaugh. We know they'd stop at nothing in this mad quest but then by the time the dust settles, they'd feel like A MACK TRUCK CRUSHED THEIR HARD FOUGHT LIES AND PROPAGANDA.
@krassenstein Yes, it'd be considered obstruction just as leftists are busy hiring political jobbers to smear kavanaugh, and in extension, delay the confirmation. Those women are just PAWNS than VICTIMS. 		YOU DON'T CARE? YES, I AGREE. YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM BUT YOUR PAROCHIAL INTEREST.
@krassenstein Harvard has bought into the shenanigans of leftists so we aren't perplexed. However, once his name is cleared by FBI and confirmation as SCOTUS done, I bet you Harvard will come calling again so this is all a sham show by them just to console or appease the cry baby leftists.
@krassenstein They were given time limit because everything is done with Time and Time is of the essence. Even Trump stay at the white house has time limit. Why do you expect FBI to do the work of 1 week in 1 year? Isn't that obstruction of the smooth sailing of the process?
@krassenstein Just a figment of your distorted imagination. Trump is doing nothing to undermine the process. All leftists are doing is litter the system with propaganda just to control the reaction of their sheepish or docile followers.
@krassenstein @holden2018 @FrancisRooney Remember 2016 election? The projections and polls were all fleeting and baseless compared to reality. Just shut up and watch the effect of reality.
@krassenstein 1. That's why FBI is investigating the allegations of the accusers.	2. LGBTQ case has been settled. Why bring it up again?	3. Nobody is denied a chance when they come into US legally. The word here is LEGAL, NOT DREAMERS, IMMIGRANTS.		IT'S NOT CALLED POLITICS.		IT'S CALLED LAW.
@EdKrassen Meanwhile, a word in English language cam mean more than one thing. It's called homonyms. Hope you didn't skip elementary English class? Meanwhile, urban dictionary isn't the standard for words or slang. Isn't it time you quit exposing your imprudence publicly with pride?
@EdKrassen Meanwhile, a word in English language can mean more than one thing. It's called homonym. Hope you didn't skip elementary English class? Meanwhile, urban dictionary isn't the standard for words or slang. Stop exposing your imprudence with pride.
@EdKrassen Online slang dictionary; BOOF; is a noun and an acronym for "burned out old fart" while flatulence: the presence of too much gas or air in the stomach or intestines. Do you see the correlation? They match. Stop twisting or defining Kavanuagh words out of context for your base.
@krassenstein Lying? You are the one that's attempting to run faster than your shadow. STOP GIVING FBI DIRECTIVES ON WHAT SHOULD BE DONE. They'd do the needful when due. Don't display acute hysteria like someone who's losing control of himself. Quite a risible show of irrelevant anxiety.
@krassenstein The democrats now send names instead of witnesses the accusers mentioned? How low can leftists go? They keep reducing the bar of expectations with impunity. Their self-serving seditious ambition is no longer surreptitious but an open secret. #ShamefullyPathetic.
@kylegriffin1 He probably meant she wasn't thinking he'd pick her. Understand otherwise at your own peril.
@EdKrassen Probably paid to speak against kavanaugh by the establishment.
@MichaelAvenatti @megynkelly She did the right thing by calling out your scam of a client.
@krassenstein Anything to spite Kavanuagh elicits riveting reaction from brian, ed &amp; democrats. All they wish for Trump's administration is failure regardless of the quantum of successful inroads it's made. Even though it costs a good man's reputation. #ShamefullyPathetic
@MichaelAvenatti @YouTube It mustn't always be democrats way. They demanded for an investigation and presidency availed. Now it's limit. Who knows what they'd demand for next if granted unlimited time. Give them an arm and they'd agitate for a head. #Rogueparty.
@krassenstein Well, we knew it's all about revenge than standing up for women. The only difference here is that those women are used as pawns by democrats to actualize their seditious ambition.
@krassenstein Fabricated witnesses of course. We knew she'd produce them but let me chip this in; their story and alibi won't stick once it's phony. One way or the other, the truth always sticks out like a sore thumb. Tell them that.
@krassenstein Trump should fire him. He's partisan in the course of the investigation. The wrath would be democratic than bipartisan, of course. They'd seek to control their docile/sheeple readers on the media with tales by moonlight.
@brashwarrior21 @krassenstein You'd do worse if you were in his shoes being accused of what you never did. It's a reflexive reaction. Imagine being smeared with accusations that could tarnish your hard earned reputation over the donkey years. Look, grow a conscience for once. He who wears the shoes knows.
@brashwarrior21 @krassenstein She came forward with witnesses who couldn't corroborate her story. There lies her truth. Don't ask me. Seek your conscience if there's anything left of it in you.
@donidumbthumbs @krassenstein @MichaelAvenatti The truth is like day and night. Following it is standard procedure which doesn't preclude knowing it if seen. You don't need to be told it's daytime or nightfall, do you? It's just there to be seen.
@tedlieu Wake up from your slumber and face the stark reality that allegations doesn't translate to conviction. Accusations without evidence doesn't imply guilt. After the investigation, if he's found innocent of those unsubstantiated claims, would cruise with confidence to confirmation.
@krassenstein @MichaelAvenatti Maybe because his is full of theatrical display with a huge political toga and bears no semblance to a REAL VICTIM. Not worth their time.
@MichaelAvenatti Maybe because yours is full of theatrical display with political toga and bears no semblance to a REAL VICTIM. Not worth their time.
@karen9872010 @EdKrassen @FBI You need back up regardless of frame up, RIGHT?  See? The leftists are revealing their true intent gradually.
@krassenstein He's just accused but not guilty. What's your point?
@JohnBrennan There's no temperament but a man who's broken due to the unsubstantiated allegations made against him. If you were in his shoes, you'd probably do worse than respond calmly. His response was tailored according to the organized lies peddled against his impeccable reputation.
@krassenstein Accusations that r void of evidence? Common sense indeed isn't really common after all since accusations have now become evidence of an act - A TYPICAL DEMOCRAT TALKING POINT. If you know anything at all, it's how to make a sucker out of yourself with your ludicrous moot points
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @ACLU They broke the policy because ACLU has been infiltrated with leftist-apologists. We aren't surprised but then, the end will determine the direction this wind will eventually go.
@krassenstein If you embrace the truth, then cease with hurling spanner and screw driver to alter the cause of the investigation with your unsubstantiated baits and tweets. Let the FBI do their job. Their findings are all we want to see not your campaign of calumny.
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Phony? Nope. He's certainly making America great again but your hateful eyes won't see it, would it?
@EdKrassen This is the same noise and brouhaha democrats made prior to 2016 election. The projections and indices according to them were green but reality dawned and every where was dead silence. Result shall speak. The silent electorates will change your narrative. #Silentelectorates.
@tedlieu She can't tell us when.	She can't tell us where.	None of the witnesses she provided can confirm her story. 	But we are supposed to shut up and believe her?		#Kavanaugh
@MichaelAvenatti @CBSPolitics She can't tell us when.	She can't tell us where.	None of the witnesses she provided can confirm her story. 	But we are supposed to shut up and believe her?		#Kavanaugh

@latimes @tedlieu From rape accusation to belligerent characterisation. What won't democrats invent just to vehemently push against Brett Kavanaugh? It's an open secret that this is all a plot to subvert his confirmation but guess what? Truth is independent of all this blatant lies peddled by you.
@NateSilver538 @tedlieu What are the lies? Mind listing them?
@EdKrassen What if devil's triangle was connotatively employed by Kavanaugh? Describing devil's triangle denotatively only depicts the general understanding of the phrase. Keep making things that aren't REAL UP. We know democrats would go to any length just to destroy an innocent man.
@mattlogical @krassenstein Are unquestionably and ludicrously paranoid of Trump's SCOTUS pick!
@mattlogical @krassenstein Kavanaugh wasn't hysterical but defending himself. Think about the trauma he's going true if all these accusations are false. Think about it and you'd understand why he broke down. Stop being selfishly blind out of hate for Trump. We know liberals are after Trump because they...
@mattlogical @krassenstein And if it's memory issue, it means all her claims are questionable and should be summarily dismissed as lacking credence. There's no way she'd pin it on an innocent soul after all said and done.
@mattlogical @krassenstein Really? Why did all the witnesses she mentioned either denied or distanced themselves from her story? Why wasn't there a single corroboration to all her claims? See? That's the point. It's either she has memory issue and couldn't recall what happened or plainly lying under oath.
@krassenstein All the witnesses she mentioned denied or distanced themselves from her story. Are you going to trust a woman whose witnesses don't corroborate her story as true? Typical liberal talking point. A doleful moment for such blind hate for Trump administration.
@rockingrinske @krassenstein Survivors matter but that doesn't mean mischievous entities can't harp into this frenzy to destroy an innocent soul. Common sense should tell you that there's every possibility of false accusation unless you choose to be intellectually blind to this grovelling fact.
@rockingrinske @krassenstein In an event all the witnesses Ford mentioned either denied or distanced themselves from this saga, it automatically poke holes in the credibility of her story. Use your head in lieu of your hate. It'd only blind you.
@krassenstein Will be dented for real.
@krassenstein I won't be astonished if democrats hire fake witnesses in their blind hate for Trump. You can't invent the truth. Reckless, baseless and unsubstantiated claims made against Kavanaugh shall be sieved out eventually. Meanwhile, once FBI exonerate Kavanaugh, democrats credibility
@littleredfish22 @krassenstein So because he emotionally defended himself now translates to aggression? Do you even know what aggression means? From rape accusation to temperament, aggression, etc who knows what'd be next. Maybe it'd be his dress taste, right? Wake up from your slumber. You r being manipulated
@krassenstein Kavanaugh will be confirmed amidst democrats plot to twist the line. Capitalizing on the precarious encounters of REAL rape victims to further democratic cause shall implode in the short run regardless of your quantum of misrepresentations.
@krassenstein You have shamelessly intensified the smear campaign with your run of the mill followers who careless about the veracity of Ford's testimony but I've news for you; no matter how you try to pull down Kavanaugh with fake witnesses, and prevarication of the truth, it'd not work.
@Paul_VanDerMeer @krassenstein I'm not sure you literally understand what strong denotes. Trump faces a barrage of attacks from Democrats all by himself. That's strength.  He doesn't need any support. All the inordinate assails at Trump has been met with reprisals. Tit for tat. That's pure STRENGTH. FIGHTER!
@Deplorable_45 @krassenstein When they've nothing to respond, they resort to silly memes. Dumb fake account.
@stouffershoe2 @krassenstein That should ring a bell of false conjectures meant to dent Kavanaugh's public image as well as galvanise public opprobrium for Democrats. Guess what? Better hatch more lies by the time FBI vindicates him, else he'd be voted in.
@stouffershoe2 @krassenstein 30 years ago says Ford with zero witness. Wake up from your slumber and face the stark reality that this is nothing but a schemed last case scenerio. Their last play card. Perhaps you were there when it happened right? All the witnesses Ford mentioned have denied knowledge of it.
@bluemaris49 @krassenstein Go and investigate him if you can. Tell you what, Trump thrives on chaos and there's nothing any of you can do about it. Democrats can throw all their weight behind the impeachment movement but it'll never fly. TRUMP IS A STRONG MAN!
@Paul_VanDerMeer @krassenstein Go and investigate him. Tell you what, Trump thrives on chaos and there's nothing any of you can do about it. Democrats can throw all their weight behind the impeachment movement but it'll never work. TRUMP IS A STRONG MAN!
@krassenstein What if someone paid her to blackmail Kavanaugh? The ifs are many and the possibilities are limitless because TALK IS CHEAP!
@krassenstein Accusations with zero evidence evince so much to be desired by a right thinking mind. What if those accusations are false? What if Ford made them up knowing out of paranoia of Purported Kavanaugh's statement about the president, row and wade etc?
@krassenstein Sexual assaults that was orchestrated by the Democrats at the cusp of Kavanaugh's confirmation, right? We all know it's a political hit job by the far leftists. They would stop at nothing to assassinate the personality of a good man with cheap worn out blackmail to score a point.
@krassenstein I'd see it as calculated attempts to discredit or assassinate his personality especially when void of evidence.
@krassenstein Depends on the circumstances surrounding the accusations. There are some allegations that are cheap worn out blackmail without any scintilla of truth especially one done at the cusp of once conferment, breakthrough, appointment, etc.
