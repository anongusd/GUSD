@raulfael I can only see you saying ikes up b is trash because it has poor recovery. Hence his side b you can also use for recovery. For fighting though it completely wrecks.

@xobnn I would go further and say it just "shouldn't cost" and end it there. It's counterproductive for society to limit people's potentials. What we afraid of? Having too many doctors or engineers? Also with more teachers we could make class sizes smaller, and more effective.

"By the time the U.S. ended its Southeast Asian bombing campaigns, the total tonnage of ordnance dropped approximately TRIPLED the totals for World War II. The Indochinese bombings amounted to 7,662,000 tons of explosives, compared to 2,150,000 tons in the world conflict".
https://t.co/uFgtgGFwiQ "The American air campaign during the Vietnam War was the largest in military history. The US contribution to this air-war was the largest. Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force Curtis LeMay stated that "we're going to bomb them back into the Stone Age"
And to be clear, I'm saying, would there even be a democratic process from within black communities discussing the distribution of reparations. Non-black individuals should NOT be part of this democratic process as well.
Especially considering the extreme hegemony that capital holds, and with it, white supremacy. Capital is always going to find its way into things to corrupt and exploit the process of any sort of production or distribution of resources, and all individuals involved.
It's kind of like the concept of Compradors. There's capital interests, individuals within the black community, like all communities, who act as compradors, seeking to exploit their fellow communities for profit. History has shown this. It can happen with reparations.
This is a perfectly valid criticism. In Earl Ofari's The Myth of Black Capitalism, Ofari expresses a skepticism for many efforts for reparations payments. He asked similar questions. Who would control the money? Where would it go? Would it be a democratic process? https://t.co/JSgDN1jTSi

@A1iensExist I believe in you, you have the power to educate and change them. 		If you don't mind me asking though , who are they leaning towards?
@A1iensExist Also for the record most of my favorite current politicians are women. I do think there's a correlation between good policy and gender to a degree. I think women are more likely to make choices based on principles of empathy.

RT @raulfael: Idk guys if Kamala Harris says its modelo time I might have to vote for her
@A1iensExist Also obviously you can have both. There's plenty of amazing women in politics across the globe. I'm just saying if the choice is representation and shitty policy vs no representation and good policy I'm going with the latter.
@A1iensExist If there's two exactly identical candidates with identical voting records and policy, of different genders, I would actually go with whoever is not a man or the less represented gender, because I do think that makes a positive difference in society.
@A1iensExist Btw this isn't me completely knocking identity politics. Representation does matter, but gtfo if you think it matters more than ending things like relentless war, stop conceding to republicans on every issue, universal healthcare, free education, etc.
@A1iensExist But seriously I can't stand non policy oriented people. If you're going to talk about politics but not policy specifics, then what the hell do you even stand for?
@A1iensExist Understandable but unfortunate. If they're your friends you shouldn't need to concede your honest views on things. Well, my back up for Bernie is Tulsi Gabbard then very reluctantly Warren, if you're going for a women that's my recommendation to them lol.

@brett0long Also like she already gets berated for simply existing in the position she's in. Yeah, she's going to be hesitant about quite a bit of issues. She's only human. Anyway I don't get why leftists complain so much when many of us think electoral politics is pointless anyway

@ProgressVoice The flip side though is both candidates have populist economic messages and are more respected by the right, and perhaps based on that they would do well in the GE. Plus IDpol could probably push Gabbard to better results regardless of whether she consciously utilizes it or not.
@ProgressVoice And the thing is their flaws aren't just criticisms the actual left hold of them but of liberals and centrists as well, Gabbard and Ojeda are both especially vulnerable to this.
@ProgressVoice Ojeda - he's going to get hammered away at for foreign policy, climate, and voting for republicans.	Warren - backstabbing Bernie and voting for trumps military budget + being hawkish. 	Tulsi - you covered this.	Yang - honestly Idk enough about him but IMO he's too obscure.
@ProgressVoice In the case of people who do like all of them, I believe most would default to Bernie. The others have far too many flaws.
@ProgressVoice I mean idk if it will necessarily split it. I think it could also force the norm to be more to the left, And push the standard for policy further left. Plus there's many people who only like one or few of these names, not all. Warren is especially unpopular.

American society largely coddles if not reinforces white supremacists constructs both directly and indirectly. 		I definitely don't have to say this for many people as this is a given for many POC starting when they are young but making clear the issue is beyond the individual.

@_Alex_Shea_ Tbh I'm not too familiar with that concept. I've seen the term thrown around a lot so I should probably do some reading on it.
@_Alex_Shea_ Although on the bright side, and this could be intentional, maybe they're calling themselves socialists (her and Bernie) to disarm people and challenge their perception of what socialism is, and make actual socialists in the future more palatable.
@_Alex_Shea_ The only people under that illusion is basically anyone who isn't a socialist lol. She's a social democrat. 	The whole democratic socialist label is so annoying because it just confused a politically illiterate populace even further.
@_Alex_Shea_ I know it's a repetitive conversation and I can tell you're on the same page but you can only expect so much from politicians lol.	There's probably no places in America you could win an election and stand for abolishing something like prison or all border security department.
@_Alex_Shea_ I get you. At this point in history though it's extremely tough to be a politician and be elected with a stance of abolishing forces on the border full stop. I think only 40% of Americans support abolishing ICE and of that 40 I'm sure many support border patrol/dhs.
@_Alex_Shea_ I understand and I agree but I think it's disingenuous to claim she claimed flat out that she wanted to basically abolish all border/immigration detention services because she didn't.
She does want to BUT she wants to replace it with DHS. She was pretty clear about that. https://t.co/hymeXibYkr

RT @The_Law_Boy: My only prediction for 2020 is that Joe Biden is gonna do a vanity run and immediately get Me Too'd
@A1iensExist @philosophrob 100% it's going to be and that's why Bernie is as popular as he is and the main reason why dems are getting dragged to the left.
@A1iensExist I'll have to find it later cause I'm at work and I can't turn the sound on my phone but yeah I think it happened during the 2016 election
@A1iensExist @philosophrob Also I've seen a lot of pictures of "republicans for Bernie" shirts.
@A1iensExist @philosophrob Did you ever see that CNN appearance he did where he got a panel full of Trump supporters to basically give him a standing ovation?
@A1iensExist @philosophrob Also, and I do think he needs to make this rhetoric more nuanced, he's been pretty forgiving of "rural white American culture" publicly and has been deflecting cosmopolitan elitism that directs disdain at the rural south. 	I think a lot of conservatives like him for that too.
@A1iensExist @philosophrob Another great reason I think Bernie is incredible. He actually gets a lot more Republican votes than people believe. For one, people view him as being one of the most honest politicians. People can tell he cares because how much he campaigned in smaller towns and the rust belt.
@A1iensExist @philosophrob Honestly Medicare for all I think may be polling even higher than 80% for dem voters. I know even for republicans it's like 52% in favor
@A1iensExist @philosophrob Also that's accurate. I think many parents enjoy the optics/theatrics of politics. The decorum/civility aspect. Kennedy is a good example, he speaks in that old timey kinda "I'm a straight shooter" politician voice and a lot of older people enjoy that.
@A1iensExist @philosophrob It's VERY dependent on age. Like I said, polling wise Bernie beats everyone significantly when you include voters under 35. If you don't include that group Biden significantly beats everyone else in the polls as far as dems.
@A1iensExist @philosophrob I mean it really just depends. I think self identifying libs are pretty split right now. They may think Bernie is not a good candidate but policies like medicate for all are now polling at 80% approval for the dem party so that says a lot.
@A1iensExist @philosophrob Overall I just want Bernie because his policies are solid, and he has the momentum that no one else has. He also polls best if you include voters under the age of 35 which assholes like CNN won't include that age range in their polls.
@A1iensExist @philosophrob I also think it's interesting you think she wouldn't fly with liberals. If anything many liberals still believe more moderate is the path to victory and think Bernie is too radical.
@A1iensExist @philosophrob And yeah Bernie will pick someone good. The worst we'd get would probably be like Elizabeth Warren so that's not TOO bad.
@A1iensExist @philosophrob I think most of that problem is just capitalism running it's course. When the model of education becomes a business the shareholders are gonna do whatever it takes to extract as much value as they possibly can out of the consumer/students
@A1iensExist @philosophrob I agree at least judging from my current knowledge on education
@A1iensExist @philosophrob It's cause he hunches over and his hair lol. But he as just as vigorous if not more than Biden.
@A1iensExist @philosophrob Also for independent ticket it looks like we're gonna get a Kasich/Hickenlooper campaign.	Then were gonna have Andrew Yang (may be running as a dem) 	And maybe like Bloomberg (again could be running as a dem).
@A1iensExist @philosophrob So far the lineup for dems seems to be: (? Indicates a maybe)	Bernie 	Beto? 	Harris	Klobuchar?	Gillibrand 	Booker	Warren 	Ojeda	Biden 		Then some random business people:	Steyer 	Schultz?	Cuban? 	Zuckerberg? (I honestly think these 3 will not run but they've blabbed about it)
I would fucking love to see AoC, Rashida Tlaib,  Ilhan Omar, or Pramila Jayapal run for President one day.
@A1iensExist @philosophrob Sorry forgot to put *think* before it's disgusting
@A1iensExist @philosophrob Lol just never too sure. Not sure if you identify as a liberal but I know a lot of centrist dems/libs  it's disgusting that Bernie is even considering running. They're like "he's too old!"... then they fucking ask you to vote for someone like Biden who is literally a year younger
I thoroughly enjoy that at this point in my life, many of my friends come to me first when asking about politics.
@A1iensExist @philosophrob Andrew Yang also seems not too shabby but I don't know as much about him.
@A1iensExist @philosophrob Not for this election but in the future I would LOVE to see Barbara Lee run or Tulsi Gabbard, maybe Ro Khanna.
@A1iensExist @philosophrob I also right now kinda like Ojeda. However I'm skeptical of his foreign policy and climate views
@A1iensExist @philosophrob On the policy substance he has rarely changed his message, always cuts to the point and you know exactly what he's for. Too many candidates give too many platitudes/ambiguous statements on what their policies are
@A1iensExist @philosophrob You may hate me for this but I'm 100% for Bernie Sanders 2020. 		I think there's some other potentially good candidates But none have the momentum or popularity that Sanders has. Bernie is the most liked politician in the country by a mile and has the highest approval rating
@A1iensExist @philosophrob https://t.co/sIOEuQRzfQ		Reminder that Amazon , which I think is his 7th or 8th largest corporate donor, does shit like this and works with ICE. Also recently I heard/read Amazon is getting contracts from the Pentagon and CIA
@A1iensExist @philosophrob Very corporate. Taking money from military departments of the govt and big corps like Amazon/ibm and some money from the military industrial complex like Lockheed Martin.  Also a lot of oil companies there and tech companies who are usually not very progressive. https://t.co/4xbyrMtH1s
@A1iensExist @philosophrob I mean I wouldn't say a way different picture. I'm assuming you're thinking that because his small donor donations (under 200) make up about half of his contributions which is understandable. I can see why that would give that image but you gotta consider the other half is
@A1iensExist @philosophrob Yeah, unfortunately people do. Idk if you've seen but there's a bunch of headlines floating around saying "he's a white Obama!" Which imo is  super cringey, especially considering we really can't afford another milquetoast Republican-light centrist like Obama.
@A1iensExist @philosophrob Still would have been better than Cruz though. I 100% supported him in his Senate race but for something like President, hell no.
@A1iensExist sorry if I'm spamming you all these links/screenshots but while the topic is being discussed, felt this was very relevant. https://t.co/x7x9kWiZ0K

@A1iensExist @philosophrob I mean is it really that surprising? I mean I'm not saying to not do more research, but, he attended AIPAC and rejected Bernies Medicare for all on a small technicality. He's also pretty hawkish when it comes to foreign policy. From my knowledge he's not very progressive

@jb_negron Luckily the hidden treasures/gold bars give you a fuckton of cash so I haven't really had money problems so far but still at the beginning of the game I was getting pretty irked. Also trying to go max honor and it's definitely not helping lol
@inyourfur I got on a train just to complete a challenge for killing 5 birds while on a moving train and all these lawmen thought I was gonna rob them so they started shooting me and I quickly like halfed my honor and got a bounty of 100+ dollars just cause I defended myself lol.
@inyourfur Yeah you gotta be careful riding your horse through town that's happened to me too many times. I'm trying to max out my honor too and its super fucking hard considering the game constantly forces you to do bad things in the missions.
It pisses me off to no end that Red Dead Redemption 2 constantly has you start missions where you don't get a chance to put on a mask/bandanna to not add to your bounty and you have to spend insane swaths of cash to constantly get rid of your bounty just because of story missions

@inyourfur @ryeehn If there was a separate prop for letting the electorate vote on raising gas and vehicle taxes I would vote yes on that but I just don't think we can afford to cut infrastructure spending when we have a lot in poor condition.
@inyourfur @ryeehn I mean dude CA is ranked 49th in the nation as far as road conditions, half of our roads are in poor conditions and we have a fuckton of bridges too that are structurally deficient. I'd rather not have some scary accident happen where a bridge collapses and kills a bunch of pple
@inyourfur @ryeehn I'm guessing the main reason you want to vote yes is for that reason and not saving money on gas from the current difference in tax rates because the difference that it will change back to is not that much.
@inyourfur @ryeehn You're gonna hate us on prop 6 I remember your tweet lol. Btw as you'll see in the video we both see positive aspects for a yes vote, we like that it makes it so they need to get a vote to approve any new taxes on gas or vehicle fees.

Does anybody else go through seemingly predictable cycles of good and bad moods? Like it seems I always have a week of being in a good mood then a week of feeling shitty and depressed and having anxiety then back and forth.
@_Alex_Shea_ Seeing a lot of definitions for the word but not really anything on the origin. The most frequent answer I'm seeing is the one I just posted. Most people are claiming it came out of 50's and 60's when the Soviet Union took over countries like Czechoslovakia.
@_Alex_Shea_ https://t.co/JjMuD4gkqI I've literally never heard of this website/news source so I'm reluctant to believe this. I've also seen multiple answers saying it originated from western communists supporting USSRs decision to invade socialist republics in eastern europe.
@_Alex_Shea_ Also sorry for asking for so much labor, it's just hard to find an answer on this that isn't outright hostile.
@_Alex_Shea_ It seems there isn't really any reliable answer at least based on first glance. Care to go into any more detail? Not that I'm doubting you, lol, I genuinely want to know more specifically where the term came from, cause I'm seeing a bunch of different answers.
@_Alex_Shea_ I honestly did not know where the origin of the term came from, I just did a google search and honestly there doesn't seem to be definitive proof of where it came from, at least based on a quick search. I saw an article saying it was first used by the guardian in 85 but idk
@_Alex_Shea_ Okay, I was asking what people who get called "Tankies" think of that term a little while ago on twitter, and I guess this answers my question lol.

@xobnn Sorry lol I get you though cause it's easy to find non dairy replacements for milk, butter etc but not cheese. 		You're really just gonna have to experiment and find one that works. Most vegan cheese is gnar but there's been a few I've liked.
@xobnn Well I'm p sure you gotta not eat cheese then. It's either vegan cheese or no cheese lol.
@xobnn Well have you tried vegan cheese? 	There's not much options at most groceries stores but like a sprouts or a trader Joe's should have a good variety of vegan cheeses to try.

I could have worded things better a bit, and at the time I didn't know that there was a Honduran caravan definitely coming to America, I just knew they got into Mexico. https://t.co/xyVIuxdzvJ
