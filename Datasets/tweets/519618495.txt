@TheValleyNews @ABC @NBCNightlyNews @Mayor_Bailey  this court has evidence I provided and he admitted in mediation to constantly moving because the children were told I would take them. The entire case has been based on perjury! I‚Äôve shown it and they still turn a blind eye. https://t.co/rOVmyrABk9
@SupremeCourtCA what‚Äôs your stance on State family court judges hanging up on you during a telephonic hearing? Before hanging up he rudely commented that my 12 &amp; 13 year old children do not want to have anything to do with me! I‚Äôve been alienated from them for 8 years.
@RiversideNews1 @Mayor_Bailey @riversidecagov County of Riverside turns blind eye on confirmed knowingly #ParentalAlienation. Allowing abuser to commit perjury to obtain the desirable results in family court! Judge rudely says my kids want nothing to do with me and hangs up!
@riversidecagov  I don‚Äôt recommend this county for support in child custody cases!! Who ever gets to the courts first wins! And EVERYTHING that is said about you is believed. They turn their heads to perjury even when you can show valid proof! They promote #ParentalAlienation
@parentalienate @Mayor_Bailey my abusive controlling ex husband has not followed court orders! He is against me having any type of relationship with my babies. I‚Äôve missed out on 8 years because of your corrupt court system!!! Are you willing to fix this for me?
@Mayor_Bailey what‚Äôs your stance on ParentalAlienation? And confirmed perjury and judges in your county ignoring it? My abusive ex husband kidnapped my children and has moved numerous times to prevent me filing a court order. It‚Äôs been 8 years since I‚Äôve seen my babies!
I‚Äôm requesting a huge prayer chain üôè. I am hoping the courts release Matthew tomorrow and allow him to come home. The judicial system as already betrayed him by charging him in false allegations. Hearsay is not evidence. #prayersformatthew #justiceformatthew https://t.co/mkIOjxZBeG

@WisDOJ Question, under WI state Statute 971.26 in the case involving Matthew there are 2 criminal reports, the initial one. And a 2nd one filed after I had Loralee Clark investigated. This shows she had no solid evidence and had to extend the dates to 7 months prior to benefit.

@WEAU13News What is wrong with our Justice system? This is how ECPD handled the misconduct complaint. They never outsourced it. And it took them 6 months to conduct it. In actuality they waited till Matthews Jury trial so that Officer Henning can be a witness for the State. https://t.co/6x8pRKEqdA
@WEAU13News This woman files a TRO and claims she is in imment danger and he has access to guns in which he is in a chapter 51 hold for 2 weeks what danger is she in? And the guns she sold? This is what happened next, state/county didn't get what they wanted so they charged him. https://t.co/AVg8M5dg8Z
@WEAU13News He removes the gun safe key from his personal effects and doesn't tell him that he has removed it from the hospital. Officer Henning then gives the key to the alleged victim thinking hes doing the right thing, to which she sells the registered firearms the next day. https://t.co/4VmlkKY6sz
@WEAU13News He was never talked off a bridge, but the desperate pleas of a crying woman in the police station sends one officer into the heroic mode to help. He lies to medical staff in his desperate need to help a manipulative woman get out of her marriage using the system. https://t.co/FnqYxhblEu
@WEAU13News This is how the Story of Matthew unfolds https://t.co/TQmh9F4nen https://t.co/CVA9bIqvlv
@RepRonKind @EauClairePD @EauClaireCounty 20 years of marriage and there is not one single case or record of Domestic of any kind. And the minute the alleged victim wants a divorce, the stories are created! This case has been UNJUST! https://t.co/xtPTa3cpLC
@RepRonKind @EauClairePD @EauClaireCounty In fact, Matthew has never been read his rights to this DAY! @TheJusticeDept Apparently changing the criminal complaint is legal as well! https://t.co/useUKIshXv
@RepRonKind @EauClairePD @EauClaireCounty In fact when Matthew had his final hearing for his Chapter 51 the county/state didn't obtain the results they wanted. So therefore Matthew was charged with fabricated charges! @DepSecDef @StateDept @TheJusticeDept @HouseJudDems https://t.co/s9QDpbeCtK
@RepRonKind @EauClairePD @EauClaireCounty Officer Henning was ADIMANT about having Matthew in this hold. In fact they were adamant about persecution.  @DeptofDefense According to ECPD it is allowed to remove items from a patient so registered firearm's can be illegally sold. https://t.co/3tgC5l2NKA
@RepRonKind @EauClairePD @EauClaireCounty This is how ECPD conducted the misconduct complaint. Took 6 months, in fact they waited till Matthews Jury trial to finish the investigation that way Officer Jesse Henning can be a witness for the state.  Hows that for credibility!! https://t.co/c6mD79dy5N
@RepRonKind @EauClairePD @EauClaireCounty This officer then lied to the alleged perpetrator when he was confronted stating he did not make such comments about the bridge. Where is the integrity? Aren't we suppose to trust our Peace officers? https://t.co/CCL0YkVjbQ
@RepRonKind @EauClairePD  This man was not talked off a bridge as you can see in these reports, in fact he was released by a Psychiatrist from any suicidal threats. The officer involved in this case LIED to medical staff to falsely Ch. 51 him.  @EauClaireCounty https://t.co/vypmi2y3cV
@PattyforSenate This shows me malicious prosecution, the results they didn't want weren't obtained so they charged him with emotional stalking instead. In the same county he was a Deputy @EauClaireSO @EauClairePD https://t.co/mUrU3T7b4L
@PattyforSenate When is it allowed to remove personal belongings from a patient who was deemed safe from another medical facility, based on hearsay? without permission of that patient, so that the alleged victim can sell the firearms without permission? https://t.co/P0AtR3fTD9
@PattyforSenate This is how ECPD handle his misconduct complaint, the evidence I have between ECPD and the ADA in this case is substantial! https://t.co/syRZqDpOzc
@PattyforSenate I am writing you in regards to a case that is current in your county. It involves a man that I love. I have started a petition in his honor to get his side of the story told. https://t.co/TQmh9F4nen https://t.co/7yVvcKMpXD

@UWEC_POLICE @EauClairePD @EauClaireSO @sacredhearthosp @MayoClinicHS @EauClaireCoEM @EauClaireFire @UWEauClaire Oh, looks like you are a frequent flyer at these places.. that way you can falsely detain people on Chapter 51 and then if things don't go your way charge them with a criminal case. Go black n Blue!
@UWEauClaire @UWEC_POLICE HA! You just place the veterans that have PTSD behind bars for safety reasons JUST in case they are the EXACT same case you once had a few years back! Because all Veterans are the same! PTSD effects Veterans the same way!
@UWEC_POLICE Matthew Thornwall got to spend Father's Day in JAIL. On charges that your department collaborated. On that note, I am so glad the rest of you got to spend the day with your children at home! Way to go, https://t.co/TQmh9F4nen
