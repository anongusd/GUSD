@lynnv378 It easy to believe things that agree with the world view you already hold. In order to grow as a person you must continually question your own beliefs and reactions to what you hear or read. I don't know how much being white has to do with it but does seem to be a problem.
@TheGoodGodAbove Fun way to waste time.
@EdKrassen He has some good ideas but we need someone new and younger. He also has too much baggage from 2016.
@EdKrassen Past that point now.
@brhodes Past time for people to think Lindsey Graham is a credible voice on anything.
@davidmweissman You hit the nail on the head. Fear and willful ignorance is what they all have in common.
@joshtpm FOX news is the perfect place for those two.
@MrDane1982 Drug addiction
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump At the very most, Trump will only be in office for a total of 8 years. When you look back will those 8 years be worth destroying your reputation over. You have turned into a gutless wonder.
@sahilkapur Obama. Smart,competent,and classy.
@MrDane1982 Christopher Smith. Gone too soon,too young.
@MollyJongFast @Olivianuzzi He's a disgusting S.O.B.
@MrDane1982 They somehow believe their children will be different than everyone elses. We see our kid the way we hope they will be. Religion makes the disconnect even worse.
@inetsoho @realDonaldTrump The woolly guys are intelligent ones.

@adamconover All tips  need to be in cash. A lot of companies are doing the same.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You could cover your whole body in flag pins. You would still be a traitor and trash.
@Stop_Trump20 Looking for love.
@SenatorLankford Sometimes better to say nothing rather than show you back a traitor. Shame on you.
@MollyJongFast All his car commercials are creepy.
@DanCrenshawTX @juliettekayyem Got your ass handed to you.
@DerekCressman How about greedy guts.
@admiralmpj @MattMurph24 Trump and family.
@dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi Trump is a incompetent fool. Nancy Pelosi is every thing he's not.
@Stop_Trump20 One in the same.
@dcexaminer @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi She is just what we need. Trump and republicans are weakening the country. Nancy fighting tooth and nail to stop them.
@wesee00 @Kokomothegreat I come from a family that has a lot of maga  folks. The reason their so willfully ignorant is because they only listen to others like themselves. If by chance some follow you take the opportunity to show them there's another side to the debate.
@BettyBowers Franklin Graham and others like him have nothing to do with God. It's all about the money the can make off the people who fall for their B.S.
@KaitMarieox Needs to spend more time in school. Poor child dumb as a rock.
@jules_su Open boarder. Scares the hell out of trump and that's worth a lot.
@Jersey_Craig All that little pig cares about is getting attention. She does care how stupid she sounds.
@AdamJamesM60 Democrats the party of decency, republicans not so much.
@Perduesenate Work towards availability of affordable birth control if you really care about babies.
@JimInhofe @realDonaldTrump You didn't give a damn about the wall when republicans had total control. So cut the B.S. and work for the American people. Get the government open.
@SenatorLankford If you really work for the American people work to get you dear leader to reopen the government.
@senatemajldr Let the Senate vote to reopen the government.
@VP @marklevinshow You need to put your country ahead of your desire to be president. You and the rest of your gutless party need to get the government open again.
@GaryLegum Just goes to show people at the top are not worth the ridiculous amount of money they are paid.
@WIRED Not a problem if you don't eat meat anyway.
RT @funder: Trump must resign. Retweet if you agree. Then listen to my interview below where Congresswoman Gwen Moore becomes the first USâ€¦
@RandPaul Excuse me, but aren't the Republican in charge.
@TSearcaigh @brycetache The god they believe in agrees with whatever hateful thoughts that happen to have. They make him up as they go.
@DanCrenshawTX @hughhewitt Trumps idea of a beautiful wall is every bit as ridicules as him and his devotees.
@SenatorLankford You need to insist gutless wonder Trump makes the same trip.
@BrianKarem I've had a couple of colonoscopies with no anesthesia. At least there over in less than an hour. Trump pain just keeps going and going.
@brianstelter O.k. to interview, if you call her out on every lie she tells.
@MrDane1982 Treated unfairly.
@ggreenwald Maybe he has shown a light on a lot that's wrong.
@jimsciutto @senorrinhatch Too little to late. You have shown people what you really are.
@KFILE Take more than a beard to make that worm look good.
@NickPonticello Old and female
@Dax_x98 Oklahoma, unfortunately a very red state.
@MrDane1982 He loves to hear his own name. So no matter what we call him his name should not be spoken.
@MollyJongFast If you don't like something don't eat it.
@williamlegate Actually had a family member post Trump was sent by god. There is no reasoning with this kind of stupidity. Sad.
@eileen_finerty @B52Malmet @TrisResists @TrinityResists @TopRopeTravis @debbiesideris @lfkraus @StormResist @brycetache @TheSWPrincess @axidentaliberal @jacksnowknows In deep s**t.
@19lulu78 @cloudynatknit @EndDeportations @joshharder He was sent by god. Unfortunately was a family member so I couldn't tell her how ignorant she sounded.
@mikandynothem @Truthseeker126 @DonnaWR8 @TheTrumpLady @codeofvets @LeahR77 @carrieksada @ArizonaKayte @KatTheHammer1 @Trump454545 @Purple_POV You need to see a doctor concerning the delusions your experiencing.
@ida_skibenes The republicans have done a good job of vilification when it comes to democrats and liberals. The 30 to 40 percent who support Trump refuse to believe anything negative about him.
@MissMayVon1 I detest Trump and his family. But believe in order to understand the other side we must at the very least listen to what their saying.
@stucam7771 trump supporters operate from fear and hate. In order to maintain their ridiculous world view they ignore anything that doesn't agree with what they believe.
@EricBoehlert Being a pastor has nothing to do with being a decent, honest person.
@mcspocky Voter apathy. Better this election but still not where we should be.
@lynnv378 My husband makes pumpkin pie with extra spice. Just the way I like it.

@Maggie_Klaus @thehill Their afraid of Nancy Pelosi.
@CloyceDuBois @daromo53 @Kokomothegreat The fact he's shown that so many of my fellow citizens are gullible behind belief. Many are my own family members. Makes me sad and afraid for this country.

@cameron_kasky Slow news day???
@cameron_kasky This is you chance to learn just how delusional and wilfully ignorant the trump people are. Just start tossing out random facts. To much for them to comprehend.
@Dax_x98 Bad times at the El Royal.
@Kokomothegreat What have you been drinking??
@LindseyGrahamSC How can you even stand your spineless , dishonest, disgusting, self.
@cspanwj Looked like he was a little kid being forced to apologize for doing something wrong. Was easy to see he didn't mean a word he was saying.
@funder True but we have our own village idiot.
@Philip_Elliott But his dingbat devotees will believe.
@atrupar Willful ignorance.
@Stop_Trump20 Oklahoma
@ZerlinaMaxwell Trumps supporters are all guilty of being willfully ignorant. No other explanation for not seeing what's right in front of them.
@MBrake02 So sorry for the loss of your husband.
@fred_guttenberg They hate or fear the same things trump does. They ignore everything else. There is no amount of arguing or evidence that will change their minds. Their happy with their hate.
@GovHowardDean The fact she's on Fox news tell us all we need to know.

@NYDailyNews Why are people still talking about this. Bill, Monica and Hillary have been through the wringer over what happened. Time to let it go.
@jjauthor @ChelseaClinton Your sick.
@SenatorLankford Low wage jobs are the majority of what's being created. Why not talk about oklahoma being #2 for people being uninsured. Or how about your support for someone who has no business on the supreme court.
@SenJoniErnst Shame on you!
@Dangchick1 There are plenty that don't. Never have, never will.
@LindseyGrahamSC What the hell is wrong with you?

@LindseyGrahamSC What's the hurry? Perhaps you have something to hide?
@JeffFlake FBI investigation first.
@ChuckGrassley FBI needs to do the investigation. You and the other old GOP pervs have already made up your mind.
@thomaskaine5 For many more important to go along with friends and family even if their wrong.
@Maggie_Klaus Same here.
@LindseyGrahamSC @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Have you lost your mind like your dear leader?
@LindseyGrahamSC @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump You poor man. What do the Russian have on you?
