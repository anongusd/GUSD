WTO rulings often move at a glacial pace. 		American industries suffering now should not be asked to wait for potential action from international court that could be years down the road.
This ruling is a good reminder why‚Äîafter decades of inaction‚Äî @POTUS stood up for our country on the world stage to get us better deals, and why he should continue to do so.

Given the public and private interest and resources already available, there is no reason the wall can‚Äôt be completed quickly and correctly. #BuildTheWall
I spoke with @SecNielsen about what I can do to ensure the wall is built on time and under budget, which is what @POTUS, Congress, and the American people rightfully expect and deserve.
Before @POTUS‚Äôs national emergency declaration, the Army Corp of Engineers had been contracted to build physical barriers along the southern border. 		Their work so far can generously be characterized as overpriced and inefficient.
.@POTUS: ‚ÄúWe must choose between 		greatness or gridlock 		results or resistance		vision or vengeance		incredible progress or pointless destruction.‚Äù		Let‚Äôs choose greatness. https://t.co/S5MI7qCn8j
I urge my colleagues to support the proposed rules changes that would prevent good nominees from being anonymously delayed and derailed.

It‚Äôs good to see Mr. Wheeler confirmed, and I hope to bring him to North Dakota soon.

As they continue through the process, I‚Äôm pushing for reforms to the way we handle nominations. 		The proposed changes would help ensure qualified nominees like Drew and Peter can‚Äôt be anonymously and unnecessarily held. 		The failures of last Congress should not be repeated.

As it relates to building physical barriers along the southern border, I met with Tommy Fisher of Fisher Industries today, who believes his North Dakota company could build the wall on time and under budget.  https://t.co/NObv5GzvoV
This legislation pays for 55 miles of new border barriers and includes $22.5 billion for overall border security.
Through divided government we achieved a deal that provides a down payment for the wall, doesn‚Äôt limit executive action on border security, meets the needs of our immigration law enforcement, and fully funds the government through the fiscal year. https://t.co/Fo7BdAsbXm
While Democratic leadership has refused to tackle this issue, I stand with @POTUS in favor of funding border security as we head into budget talks for the upcoming fiscal year.
From day one, @POTUS made it clear he‚Äôs ready to address the crisis at the southern border, whether or not Congress works with him. https://t.co/AvJ1OJ9qnA

Barr‚Äôs nomination is another example of one side unnecessarily holding up a qualified nominee- who is inevitably confirmed anyway- only because of political posturing. 		The current system does not work. Both sides need to come together to reform the way we handle nominations.
William Barr‚Äôs confirmation today presents an opportunity to highlight the need to reform the nominations process. 		In this case, Democrats- for no reason- delayed his committee vote by one week. https://t.co/qRspXQoP0Q
Mr. Barr assured me he would take the DOJ in a more federalist direction by reforming the department‚Äôs culture, and I look forward to working with him to ensure that happens.
When I met Mr. Barr, I expressed concerns about the consolidation of litigation authority at the DOJ and how this has empowered bureaucrats to fight states‚Äô rights and constitutional principles.
I voted for William Barr because he‚Äôs an accomplished attorney with decades of public service who is ready to take on the bureaucracy within the Department of Justice. https://t.co/e9nSsmV6S5

The military is foundational for North Dakota culture. These subcommittees help ensure our military community will continue to be a hub for new innovation and security for the entire country.
The Emerging Threats and Capabilities Sub-Committee is responsible for programs related to emerging technologies, which includes space research projects that have a nexus to the @UofNorthDakota.
The Airland Sub-Committee oversees the Army and Air Force, giving me direct nexus to bases in Grand Forks and Minot. 		It also oversees the National Guard, which has nearly 4,000 soldiers and airmen dispersed across the state, especially Bismarck and Fargo.
My seat on the Strategic Forces Sub-Committee has wide jurisdiction over our Nuclear forces and missile defenses. 		Serving on this committee will be of benefit to the ICBM and B-52 Bomber missions at @TeamMinot.
I asked for @SASCMajority subcommittees where I could have the greatest impact for North Dakota. They give us a voice on important state issues like the Grand Forks and Minot Air Force Bases, Cavalier, UND, and the National Guard. https://t.co/6ohPsaoogh

I supported today‚Äôs deal. 		While @SpeakerPelosi refused to even come to the table, @POTUS was the adult in the room who ended this impasse.

This bill reaffirms this simple truth: our Middle East allies are our friends, and their enemies are our enemies. I urge my fellow senators to join us in standing with them by passing the SASME Act.
As my colleague Senator Rubio has noted, the SASME Act‚Äôs growing opposition from Senate Democrats may be nothing more than a thinly-veiled attempt to hide the rising anti-Semitism in their own party. 		Not only is that unacceptable, but it‚Äôs also not working.
Unfortunately, some of our colleagues seem to be using the unrelated partial shutdown as an excuse to oppose the SASME Act, but their rationale does not add up. 		If we truly are the world‚Äôs greatest deliberative body, we should be able to deliberate multiple issues at once.
In addition to my colleagues who introduced the bill‚Äî @marcorubio, @SenatorRisch, @SenCoryGardner and @senatemajldr‚Äî the SASME Act is backed by prominent pro-Israel groups who understand the importance of this legislation.
I am signing on as a co-sponsor to S.1, the SASME Act. This bolsters security cooperation with Israel and Jordan, authorizes sanctions against the Syrian dictatorship, and allows our state and local governments to properly counter anti-Israel movements.		My statement‚Äî&gt; https://t.co/XmKDxMAnMO
