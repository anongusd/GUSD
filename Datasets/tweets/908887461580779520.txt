@SpeakerPelosi, what a COWARD you are. You won't even show these women a shred of respect. You're not a leader, you have no backbone, and you've done nothing but hurt this country since you have been Speaker. Continuing hiding, COWARD. #PelosiShutdown		https://t.co/Ng7OrvoliV
@RepJuanVargas @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP Can you honestly say saving $5B is more important than border security? Than 800k federal employees? With more and more caravans coming to America's doorstep you act like a wall is a bad thing, yet you hide behind the wall here in San Diego. You're a follower, not a leader.

Except all house democrats have done us hold 800,000 federal workers hostage with petty politics over $5B. How much in foreign aid have we given other countries @SpeakerPelosi? But we can't even listen to our own Border Patrol that said they need a wall? Good job not listening! https://t.co/SX8zCftUir
#democratshutdown It's $5B! How many billions have gone to foreign aid? And we cant put $5B towards our own security? Even after the border patrol exclaimed they need the wall! #maga #trump #buildthatwall https://t.co/kCBA4z64jp
The correct wording is: As we enter the third week of the #democratshutdown, the reality is that 800,000 federal workers still haven't received their paychecks because dems have flip flopped on border security because they don't like Trump. https://t.co/UeP5T65xyq
