#tankerfire tanker owned by Edwards Petroleum Transport, Las Vegas. Information now on the media portal, with pics.

“@UDOTTRAFFIC: Detour for the I-15 closure between Nephi &amp; Scipio is SR-28 through Gunnison &amp; I-70 or US-50. #tankerfire
@MDundie they'll get to it as soon as possible. But @UtahDOT needs to evaluate conditions first.
Juab County just told me that the fire is OUT. #tankerfire #phew
Just hearing that fire is contained. #tankerfire. Other tanker was not compromised.
.@KSLsampenrod Trying to find that info right now...Any help @udottraffic? Looking for #tankerfire alternate routes.
#tankerfire driver was not injured.
Strategy right now for #tankerfire is to suppress as quickly as possible and protect the other tanker. No one wants a second explosion.
#tankerfire call came in at 7:36 p.m. as a rollover and explosion. (info from Juab County) We're helping them with info dissemination.
