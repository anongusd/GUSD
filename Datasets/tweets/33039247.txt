A major foreign policy decision that negatively affects the US just as much as it does the world was carried out not on strategy or facts, but on appeasing a block of voters. This should give everyone pause.
The President‚Äôs base ‚Äî much like Trump himself ‚Äî is focused inwardly on themselves. This is why Trump‚Äôs message resonated with voters in 2016 and why he never seems to dip below 40 percent in his approval ratings. They like his message. They love his decisions.
Many will talk about the impact this choice will have across the world, but the underlying story here is a subset of America is happy with this decision. They see a President who is fighting the establishment, keeping campaign promises, and claiming to return the US to greatness
Mattis was one of the few voices left in the Trump administration who could speak up to the President and give world allies and US politicians hope that instability stopped at the door to the West Wing. Now, he‚Äôs gone.
This seemingly knee-jerk decision has resulted in the resignation of Secretary of Defense James Mattis, a widely respected and lauded military leader on both sides of the political aisle.
Red meat that consists of people‚Äôs lives, our standing in the international community, and our security at home. We‚Äôve ceded ground to international foes and terrorists to curry favor with a small group of American voters.
As I see it, the withdraw of US troops from Syria was essentially red meat thrown to a rabid base that yearns for a strong country but doesn‚Äôt truly grasp ‚Äî or seems to care about ‚Äî the role we play in the world or how we became a global power.
Was there consideration of the ramifications this withdraw would cause? Did the President think about how this would impact allies? Did he really grasp the magnitude of this decision? All signs seem to point to no.
(Thread) What‚Äôs particularly alarming about President Trump's decision to withdraw from Syria is that it appears it was done to stay in the good graces of his base that was upset with his inability to fulfill a key campaign promise, the border wall.
