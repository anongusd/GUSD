@BigEastSilver @VanessaW @verizonfios @GetSpectrum @Ask_Spectrum 😫😩😣
Before I left I TRIED w/ @verizonfios b/c there were technical issues and no service in my apt w/ bad internet and no working landline for the last 2 yrs &amp; they couldn’t offer good costumer service. It’s a shame. I would still go back at this point b/c that’s how bad spectrum is.
@VanessaW @verizonfios @GetSpectrum @Ask_Spectrum TWC used to enrage me and I figured, gosh, it’s been 7+ years, I’m sure it’s changed. NOPE!
The guide never works. The DVR never works. The interface is terrible. Everything is so slow. It’s crap. And, so frustrating. I’m thinking of leaving @GetSpectrum / @Ask_Spectrum now. The only thing I still enjoy is @NY1. Sigh.
I had Time Warner Cable from 2002 - 2012. Then, I switched to @verizonfios to see what all the hype was about &amp; LOVED. Recently, the cost has just been exorbitant. So, I went back to TWC (now called @GetSpectrum / @Ask_Spectrum) &amp; in 3 days I know why I left in the first place!!!

@RodriguesMatt @nytimes Exciting!!!
S1 started like a good alternative &amp; swiftly became one the most hilarious things I’ve ever seen. When I got to #WarmestRegards, I knew I was obsessed!!! So, I binged S2 &amp; 3. Impeccable writing. Brilliant ensemble acting. THEN, S4 made my ♥️ explode! #SimplyTheBest #SchittsCreek https://t.co/HUB1Go2JtB
In all this madness &amp; insanity going on in this country, I’ve been searching for comedy, for healing, for laughter amidst all this sadness, anger, rage &amp; disappointment. I can channel most to my activism but levity was so needed. #SchittsCreek is that for me! @danjlevy is a gem!
Have spent the last few days telling EVERYONE I know to watch @SchittsCreek. @netflix/@PopTV. I even bought 3 missing episodes from OnDemand S4 on iTunes b/c I couldn’t wait. 		@danjlevy is Canada’s gift to the U.S. He’s quite literally an international treasure! 🖤	#SchittsCreek https://t.co/HDSoluf6xP
