@marconi64 Stay on subject. You know DACA was unconstitutional. Difference here is that the current policy is unconstitutional.		And it isn‚Äôt a distraction. It is simply pointing out the difference between the American people and the radical open borders idea of @TheDemocrats leadership.
@marconi64 @PressSec Just like @BarackObama and #DACA
@marconi64 @PressSec Bottom line is the definition of ‚Äújurisdiction‚Äù. Where I take the original definition, ‚Äúhaving allegiance ‚Äú, you take it pertaining to courts.
@marconi64 @PressSec Good debate. Thanks. But there will be others a lot smarter than me that will be arguing the case. We can definitely see the arguments on both sides.
2. all other persons born within the Republic, of parents owing allegiance to no other sovereignty, are natural-born citizens.‚Äù		Since illegals owe allegiance, they are not US jurisdiction, therefore not citizens. We will have to see what the courts say. https://t.co/OTOt8AcKmP
@marconi64 @PressSec Bingham who wrote XIV ‚ÄúAll from other lands, who by the terms of your laws and a compliance with their provisions become naturalized, are adopted citizens of the United States;
@marconi64 @PressSec So what is the difference? Illegal immigrants are citizens of other countries and have their own courts.		Besides, XIV was never intended for either. It was written for former slaves.

@marconi64 @PressSec The Supreme Court did in Elk v. Wilkins in 1884. All Native Americans were given citizenship in 1924, Indian Citizenship Act.
@marconi64 @PressSec We‚Äôll find out. It depends on the interpretation of ‚Äúsubject to the jurisdiction thereof‚Äù.
‚ÄùThis excludes illegal immigrants who are in defiance of U.S. jurisdiction and are citizens of a foreign power.‚Äù		#MAGA #KAG #BLEXIT

Question. I keep hearing the #Mueller investigation has now turned to obstruction of justice, no collusion found. So how can @realDonaldTrump be guilty if obstruction? If there was no crime, there is nothing to cover up or obstruct. @seanhannity @SenateGOP @HouseGOP
@SenSchumer Talk about partisan and misleading. Has anyone in the @realDonaldTrump administration even hinted a firing #Mueller? Stop trying to make things up and mislead #WeThePeople
@HeidiPrzybyla So why was the #dossier used when it did come out?
#TheMemo does not give a black eye to our wonderful @FBI. It calls out a few bad apples who had too much power. @Comey is upset because it calls him out for his poor decision. We need the FBI leadership to be nonpartisan when doing their job.
What the @SenateGOP and @HouseGOP need to do is be as honest as possible with #WeThePeople. @TheDemocrats look like fools calling #SOTU divisive and bigoted. @POTUS is offering amnesty and most Americans want border security. Act mature and honest and repubs will sweep 2018
@MarkDaniel32 @BetoORourke @TheDemocrats @realDonaldTrump Last I heard it was $25 billion. No where near a quarter trillion. I‚Äôm sure you just made a simple typo there.  And most Americans don‚Äôt see it as a waste of money.
@whataberger @CBSNews @CNN I‚Äôll accept that. There hasn‚Äôt been time yet to get those numbers. When they do come out, I think you will be surprised. But I may be wrong. Just because it isn‚Äôt a scientific poll, doesn‚Äôt mean it is wrong.
@Richardafowler @guypbenson @foxnewsnight @ShannonBream I did. And the @realDonaldTrump immigration proposal is common sense. It‚Äôs what most Americans agree with. Amnesty to #dreamers, it isn‚Äôt their fault. Secure our borders, and only have merit-based immigration. I just want merit to have a ‚Äúneed-factor‚Äù as well.
@whataberger @CBSNews @CNN Not hurt. But thank you anyway. I was just trying to have a mature debate and understand where you are coming from.
@whataberger @CBSNews @CNN Negative, I just think for myself. Simple math isn‚Äôt quite the same as statistics either. Once again, the left‚Äôs response to common sense and facts is vulgar language.
@trump_nazi @TulsiPress 1 I‚Äôll give you that. However, @TheDemocrats are portraying it as bigoted. Jerusalem has nothing to do with that. 2 &amp; 3, how are those divisive? What would you consider negative effects of a tax cut anyway? And for coal, I‚Äôm sure some are closing as @BarackObama waged war on them

@joekennedy how is offering amnesty ‚Äúnot us‚Äù?
@ProudResister @RepJoeKennedy Is calling the majority of Americans bigots and homophobes leadership? Is rejecting a deal to give amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants that the majority of Americans want leadership?
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Someone tell me how any statement @realDonaldTrump said was divisive.
RT @CBSNews: Three in four Americans who tuned in to President Trump's #SOTU address tonight approved of the speech he gave, CBS News poll‚Ä¶
The @TheDemocrats response to the #SOTU was horrible, and divisive. #Kennedy simply called the majority of Americans bigots, racists, and deplorable. You‚Äôd think they would have learned their lesson. @realDonaldTrump offered amnesty to millions, and they call him a bigot?

@FoxNews @SpeakerRyan If the #Dreamers want to stay with their parents, they can go with them. They‚Äôre adults now. It‚Äôs common sense. It is what #WeThePeople want. Fix the mess that @BarackObama created while showing compassion &amp; common sense by protecting the border from drugs and illegal immigrants
Heard on @FoxNews - @SpeakerRyan is trying to put together a deal to fund the gov for 4 weeks with no #DACA or border security. Avoidance is not governing. Let the #Dreamers stay with a path, parents are still illegal. Get rid of the lottery &amp; chain migration and fund #TheWall
@CNN I know some don‚Äôt like what @realDonaldTrump says about the press, but I always see a publicized positive article after a big slam by Trump.

@DeplorablesTV Exactly what I was just tweeting about!
I challenge any politician, Republican, Democrat, etc to a debate on any subject. I could win without getting personal, without twisting the truth, without spewing hate just because they have a different opinion. Most Americans are good, caring people, our politicians aren‚Äôt.
@CharlieDaniels Loved listening to them when I was a kid. I need to add a new station to my @pandoramusic
Reading Twitter almost makes me want to run for office. Politicians on both sides are corrupt. There is no common sense. Abe Lincoln said our government should be of the people, by the people, &amp; for the people. Not millionaire lawyers trying to get richer, or feed their own egos.
@funder I have no problem calling out unethical behavior in politicians. It just needs to be called out on both sides of the aisle. #CrookedHillary
