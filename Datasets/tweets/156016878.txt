There’s a lot more, too, including (what I hope are) compelling case studies, and a mix of big ideas and practical advice. It should be useful for anyone trying to make their way through a career in the modern business world, or is just interesting in these big-picture forces.
Adaptability, I argue, is a skill in and of itself (and an essential one) that you can cultivate in yourself by pushing yourself into uncomfortable life and career situations, including doing things that you’re not naturally the best at.
Another conclusion: That a successful career path in this age is likely to be nonlinear, involving sideways and even downward moves that allow a person broaden their experience, and to gain that insight.
A major conclusion: The scale and complexity of modern organizations means that people who can operate at the intersection of different types of technical expertise and understand how they connect are particularly valuable.
To report the book, I visited many of the well-run, technologically advanced companies that are the winners in the modern economy, and interviewed people who are thriving in those organizations, whose stories are used as case studies.
The rise of superstar firms that dominate major industries; a shift from a world of physical capital to information; a changing understanding what it even means to have a job. These are shifts with radical implications for everyone who wants a thriving career.
Eventually I realized that the changes in the economy I wrote about during the day and the challenges of navigating a career I talked to people about at night are two sides of the same coin. That realization is the origin of my new book.
For years I’ve worked at my day job trying to make sense of a changing economic and business environment. In the evenings, I’ve talked with countless friends, colleagues, and sources about how to achieve a durable, satisfying career in a tumultuous age.
A brief thread about the book:

@zachdcarter Yeah I agree with that.
@NathanTankus @zachdcarter Honest question: What do you consider the implication of the fact that most of the Congressional pressure on the Fed from 2008 to 2017 was in favor of tighter money? That the Fed following its dual mandate led to easier policy than most of Congress preferred?

Even if the +312k jobs numbers is an aberration (it is), combined with the labor force participation rise it is a sign that employers keep finding new workers despite low unemployment. A hot labor market makes a lot of good things happen.
Wage growth, at +3.2% year-over-year, ties with October for highest since April 2009—comfortably the highest of this expansion.
Yeah, sure, employment is a lagging indicator, but whatever the opposite of a recession-alarm-bell report, this is it.

Sure seems like that answer on quantitative tightening--that it's on autopilot and the Fed has no plans to change that--is what's freaking out markets. Powell seems not to view that as a lever to use if conditions worsen further.

Powell: Wage increases don't need to be inflationary. Tight labor market of 1990s, we had wage increases above productivity and no high inflation. It would be welcome.

Powell on what executives are saying: Mood of concern and angst about whether growth will be as strong as it has been. Doesn't mean it will come into real data in a big way. We'll have to see. For now, financial conditions tightened a bit, and we've lowered rate path a bit.

Stocks down a wee bit for the day, after being up strongly pre-announcement, but if anything I'm surprised they're not down more given a somewhat less dovish tone people seemed to be getting ready for.
Shorter @BCAppelbaum—Should we interpret dot plot as meaning some of committee views inflation undershoots as fine and good?		Powell: We still want symmetry around inflation target, honest!
@LJKawa Elaborate, please.
The era of forward guidance is over. Powell is signaling serious open-mindedness about where rates end up over the next year. All things are possible.
Powell: I think we've reached the bottom end of the range of estimates of neutral rate. Going forward, letting the data speak to us and inform the outlook and appropriate policy. Fairly high degree of uncertainty on path and destination of further increases.
Heather Long of WashPost: Has Fed had any discussion of reducing path of balance sheet normalization, what might lead FOMC to alter them?		Powell: Market very sensitive to news on runoff. Came to view would have balance sheet run off on automatic pilot. Has been good decision.
Sam Fleming of FT: One surprise has been tepid inflation data. Why do you think despite tight labor market still not much inflation? And how will Fed respond to further undershoots?		Powell: Inflation a touch below what we expected. Gives FOMC ability to be patient.
One irony being that if the Fed agreed with the White House's growth projections it would be raising rates even more, making steam come out Trump's ears. https://t.co/Lj51EYKeEa
This tone so far confirms to me that the slowdown/minirecession of 2015-2016 haunts the Fed to this day in important ways.
Powell: Fiscal stimulus was larger and more frontloaded than expected.
Powell seems more worried about international slowdown than domestic market volatility, housing softness, debt concerns, etc.
Powell: Most of my colleagues expect the economy to continue to do well. We now think more likely economy will grow in a way that calls for two, not three rate increases next year.
BUT "We have seen developments that may signal some softening"		…International slowdown, tigher financial conditions…		"in our view these developments have not fundamentally altered our outlook."
Powell: Economy has been adding jobs, wages have moved up,  Inflation low and stable. Some still struggle, economic problems remain, strong economy benefiting many Americans.
Since September, "some crosscurrents have emerged"
Here we go with Chairman Powell's press conference. https://t.co/hJ806xApMJ
In summary:		1) The Fed's basic optimism and confidence in the economy remains intact,		BUT		2) It does project slower growth in 2019 and beyond, and wants to move gingerly in case that optimism turns out to be misguided.
@SamRo I think more an artifact of who happens to be voting this year as much as anything.
Fed consensus projection is that GDP growth will slow to ~2.3% in 2019, from ~3% in 2018. Consistent with private forecasters, but a real slowdown as tax cut stimulus fades. https://t.co/yA49i0wlo6

Glad that the @BCAppelbaum book leave beard has now been shown to the world, in the Fed press conference. I wasn't quick enough to get a screencap, alas.
Powell is being refreshingly honest for a central banker about what he doesn't know about the future.
Binya Appelbaum: Do you think of policy as accommodative at present?		Powell: We don't want to suggest either that we have this precise point where accommodative stops.
@ernietedeschi We should all pin that one.
Powell: May be more room for labor force growth than we'd thought. Open to idea labor force growth could continue.
Heather Long of WashPost: Are there supply side effects from tax cuts?		Powell: We hope they're huge. The effects are very uncertain, literature isn't clear how mechanisms work. Would be soon to be seeing supply side effects.
More Powell on trade: You don't see much evidence of trade war at national, aggregate level. Still relatively small. We worry about loss of investment, market reaction, but don't see solid evidence yet.
Powell on trade: We don't make trade policy, but we have extensive network of business contacts through reserve banks, we hear rising chorus of concerns about disruption to supply chains, price increases, loss of markets.
Powell: It is true some asset prices are in upper reach of historical ranges. Not that there aren't any vulnerabilities, but we see them as moderate.
Howard Schneider of Reuters: Are these forecasts too good to be true, low unemployment, low inflation for years to come?		Powell: Yeah, forecasts show economy where unemployment stays low, inflation remains ~2%. That is based on our understanding of how inflation process works.
Powell on Trump anti-rate increase rhetoric:		We don't consider political factors. That's who we are, what we do.
NIck Timiaros of WSJ asks how they'll know it's time to end the tightening cycle.		Powell: Moving gradually allows us to raise rates and see how economy absorbs rate increases.
It's odd to me that if you take the Fed's median forecast for the unemployment rate literally, it will only come down another 2/10 by end of year, another 2/10 in 2019, unchanged in 2020. Color me skeptical, especially if GDP forecast is right. https://t.co/8g4jAnq8Hu

@Brad_Setser @rortybomb @mattyglesias Yeah, one thing I keep coming back to is that X crisis action, was with hindsight was too slow/small/timid, while at the time in both public and elite perception was risky/radical/aggressive.
@rortybomb @mattyglesias Yeah, the slow build to QE2 has its roots in the Fed's structure (in a non-crisis moment, BB did need some time to build consensus). Bigger to me is that it was positioned as one-off, not the open-ended structure of QE3.
@sarahhalzack They were good sandwiches.
@mattyglesias I agree with that. Also, I don't dispute that there are things that would have made the economic outcome better for the US with benefit of hindsight. Bigger, more sustained fiscal stimulus, going to open-ended QE earlier, etc.
@mattyglesias I'd be more persuaded of your view on the appropriate height of the bar if there were a track record (in this episode or past ones) of a country with severe financial crisis experiencing significantly better macro outcomes.

@AnnieLowrey What channel is it on?
"I'd like to see the dollar a wee bit higher" - incoming NEC director Kudlow, who apparently does not care about the tradition that only the Treasury secretary speaks about the dollar on behalf of US government.
Now CNBC commentators are talking about how Kudlow's appointment being good for stocks. Kudlow thanks them. This whole thing is strange.
More broadly there is a big difference between a cable news commentator riffing and senior White House official commenting on policy questions, and Kudlow seems to still think he's in the first category.
Good work by @ylanmui pushing Kudlow on how a new tax bill (as the president floated earlier this afternoon) could be enacted without a reconciliation bill as a vehicle. Clear Kudlow doesn't really have an answer.
If you turn on CNBC right now you can see why incoming White House officials who haven't started their jobs yet don't usually go on TV for hours talking about the latest news.

This is my semi-annual occasion to rant about how my microwave has 15 buttons on it, most of which I've never used, yet requires a multi-step, non-intuitive process to change the clock by an hour.
Hey @JustinWolfers can we get a call on whether it's beer o'clock yet because it's been a hell of a week.

@Richard_Florida Depends what you mean by "process." From roughly Kelly's appointment until a couple of weeks ago there was some semblance of orderly process. Apparently Rob Porter was a big part of that.

Here, @conorsen argues that the pinch of higher tariffs will come in the form of downward pressure on corporate profit margins, not higher consumer prices, given lack of pricing power. 		https://t.co/2cI0mtDgaO

Wilbur Ross on CNBC at 10:30 a.m. should be must-viewing.
@JoshuaHol It's because that was done under Section 201 authority which is a more "normal" way of waging a trade dispute (used by Bush with steel, Obama with tires) than invoking Section 232 national security grounds.
I wasn't covering this stuff at the time, but from recent conversations the Bush administration people who worked on the '02 steel tariffs look back with embarrassment and gritted teeth. https://t.co/YySKnJO5vR
