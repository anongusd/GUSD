@GovPenceIN time to call your boss: he just kneecapped you on Syria and Russia. Apparently you two don't talk much. Can't imagine why.

Did @realDonaldTrump just hook his hands in his pants? Darn it, that debate prep was just perfect. #debate
Question: taxes. Answer: ISIS. Question: sexual assault. Answer: ISIS.
Wow. The GOP nominee just admitted he pays no taxes. If he hadn't bragged about sexual assault, that would be the most shocking thing.
Just to be clear: Trump blames Clinton for allowing him to pay no taxes. #debate
I know nothing about Russia, says the GOP nominee. That's right up there with Gerald Ford on Soviet domination.
Paging @seanhannity: Time to debunk the debunking. Trump was against Iraq before he was for it, right? Wrong? #debate
You're right about Islamophobia, and that's a shame, says Trump. Before stoking Islamophobia. Which is actually shameless.
Step away from her, Mr Trump. Please step away. #debate
New debate tactic never before seen in a presidential campaign: pissing all over the moderators. Thanks Trump.

Pence wants to stop Russia's provocations. He could start by getting his running mate to stop encouraging Russia to hack Clinton's emails.
Donald Trump trashing NATO: Costly. Mike Pence chuckling at his running mate's quotes: Priceless.
When Pence shakes his head, is he disagreeing with Kaine or is he just struck by the sadness of his own situation?
It's a bit sad when you say your running mate's quotes count as an insult.
Donald Trump has a plan. Mike Pence says so.
The middle east is literally spinning out of control. Much like Pence's foreign policy metaphors.
