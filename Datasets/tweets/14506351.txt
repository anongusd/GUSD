@virtualwinegal @GavinNewsom Of coarse and you don't see democrats doing the same thing?  Thats why it should be Country first, not party!  We need more people that are willing to meet in the middle where most of the country would like them to be!
@virtualwinegal @GavinNewsom Mitch?  Mitch speaks for every Republican?  You know that is not true!  How about the the Democrats working across the aisle?  That doesn't matter?  Each President including Obama will be treated fairly in history.  Each has done some things we all like and some we dislike,
@virtualwinegal @SpeakerPelosi That ticket would not win!
@virtualwinegal @GavinNewsom You think every Republican is doing that?  You are wrong and not helping us come together!  This Governor is party first, not California or Country first.  We need to quit separating us!  Two parties can make this happen but not if we are always divided!
@GavinNewsom And why is that?  Define young people?
@GavinNewsom @CoveredCA You better look deeper, the leadership @CoveredCA is reliant to much on federal aid!  They can do it different and make themselves competitive!  They choose not to!
@GavinNewsom I so wish you would concentrate on California and stop watch Trump!  You got the train right in my opinion!  The Central Valley needs to the help, the rest is just wasting money!
@GavinNewsom Why do you keep saying Republicans?  Why is it about party first?  It shouldn't be and you are acting no different!  Be the difference maker!  You have that chance to bring us all together!

@GavinNewsom Why are you focused on federal issue when you just got elected to handle California?  Before you can become President you are our Governor!  Do that job first!

@MarcosBreton @floydmayweather know where and help your team you get press.  Apparently Floyd doesn't understand that.
@MarcosBreton @floydmayweather I can show you many player that got as much publicity as Lin that were black.  When you come from seamlessly
@CigarsThomas1 @floydmayweather True!  He is a hype guy!  But he maybe a racist.  Seriously!
@MarcosBreton @floydmayweather I agree!  Any player that has done what Lin did get's this publicity.
So pissed tonight that @floydmayweather made it about race!  Can't it just be about hard work, effort and persistence?
@FloydMayweather On behalf of NBA players?  That's bullshit and you know it!  That's you playing defense on what you tweeted!
@FloydMayweather When will it not be about race?  Can't athletics just be about the athlete?  Not what race they are?
@FloydMayweather In fact Melo is black and the nuggets were better without him as were the Knicks before the got there.
@FloydMayweather Why did it have to be about race?  Lin has made his team better he last week, it didn't matter what his race!
