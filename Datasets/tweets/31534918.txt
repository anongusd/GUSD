#PalinEmails is insane. To be fair, I can only imagine what @theklondar and I would do if @HCSpectator got ahold of Hamilton admins emails
Fav part: elevator traffic jam MT @TheAtlanticWire: We're liveblogging the race to read Palin's emails http://theatln.tc/kg6may #PalinEmails
#MumfordAndSons was amazing last night. Only they could make a double bass, upright piano & banjo look so badass. Totally worth the traffic.

Hey! I was 4 for the first 3 months of kindergarten. I think I managed just fine. http://t.co/NnA3TB4
So glad we only watched that Phillies game on tv. For future reference, do the food vendors remain open for all 19 innings?
Most productive day ever. Not even noon, and I've already been to Philly and back. #naptime
Can't wait to start unpacking and building all of this furniture. Also exhausted. Today has been an #ikeadventure
Just saw a commercial on TV for a #YouTube channel. Wow.
@Bethenny Me! Even though it's finals week, and I should probably be studying.
@bravoandy does @Bethenny  have any advice for aspiring business women? (does she need someone to replace max?)
Just did an interview with a local radio station, talking about #hcpundit. Crazy!
Based on the way these faculty meetings are held, it's truly amazing that anything actually gets done at this school.

I expect an equally nice spread at the dedication of the Tummarello @HCSpectator building.
Forget writing the article. My new goal is to photobomb the pictures being taken at this dedication.
While I appreciate having both versions of Most Beautiful Girl In the Room, I wish the @fotc cds included Tape of Love and Cheer Up Murray.
At what point are event attendees more focused on tweeting than actually paying attention?
"You [as a nation] don't have ten years left" - Margie Phelps. Does that mean you'll concede if we're still trucking in ten years?
"I'm your bff, fo-rizzle." No Margie, no you aren't.
"We are not the stinking government." - Margie Phelps at #cmanyc11. Thank god.

Done being editor-in-chief, but nowhere near done with the @HCSpectator!
Aww, Robert Redford respects journalism. "The country needs it now more than ever. I salute you." That's nice to hear.
At the #acpla press conference with Robert Redford!!
So excited to get back and totally reinvent the @HCSpectator online presence. Thanks #acpla !!

I'm sorry, I can't get over these panelists. I would happily take their "minimum wage" $8.75 an hour.
#acpla private college panelists say not to conduct interviews over email. Yes. New @HCSpectator rule. For reals.
At the "reporting at private colleges" panel at #acpla. Panelists say they don't get enough credit or money. WHAT?!? I'd take anything!
I HATE going to get my hair cut. Why do you bother to have me make an appointment?
It's 1:00 a.m. The Spectator has been submitted. One issue left. What?!?
I'm having trouble processing the fact that it's not even 3:30 on a thursday morning and I'm in my room, not the @hcspectator office.
@BravoAndy How can lisa see right through camille and taylor, but have no inclination about cedric?
@fmanjoo Just read the piece on spacing (so interesting!). On every smart phone I've had, typing 2 spaces puts a period after the last word.
To the girlfriends who spent the weekend watching their boyfriends throw fits over men who wear tights and run into each other, #ISaluteYou
Just saw a commercial for my elementary school on tv. What?!?
@megabus Do you have an ombudsman on staff? If so, how can I contact them?
Waiting for the bus: 45 min,	 waiting for the driver: 15 min,	 waiting on hold to talk to the co.: 1 hr, 	@megabus experience: infuriating.
Done with finals. Just saw the Nutcracker. Finally feels like Christmas!

Why couldn't I be studying in London this semester? Also, why don't american students protest over higher ed costs? http://huff.to/9tJEJ6
Sitting in the sci center, and my ears perk up when I overhear profs near me mention the spec. The spec has become my baby cub.
New spec site is up!!!!  Some minor things for C&D to fix, but the content is all there.  Check it out: students.hamilton.edu/spectator
Done with the spec and it's 4.  What?!
The worst part of the 7am walk back from the spec office is smelling breakfast but knowing I can't stay awake until the dining hall opens.
Bakery run! I love when mom comes to visit.  http://twitpic.com/2gwew3
Orientation issue of the spec is out now!  Read it, love it, talk it up to the new students.
@theklondar Hrmm. Smaller. And filled with to-be-unpacked boxes. But new, so good? Although Lisa is all about not moving the furniture...
