It was a privilege to welcome Lauren to Capitol Hill yesterday to share her #HigherEd story @sunyjefferson @WDTnews https://t.co/A1h67obuC9
I invite those in the audience and following along on Twitter to submit questions for our panelists using the hashtag #GOPFuture.
&amp; foster an educational system that returns its focus to where it belongs: prepping our students to compete in a 21st Century global economy
but also offer a diverse set of proposals and feedback that will help us in our efforts to support the empowerment economy
I look forward to hearing from our panelists who will be able to discuss not only the need for an environment of flexibility &amp; fresh ideas
Even if that decision is to attend technical school, community college, a four-year institution, or pursue an advanced degree #GOPFuture
We must empower our students with the access, flexibility, technology and information needed to make sound decisions #GOPFuture
We must  find solutions to this crisis while also understanding that the challenges facing our #highered are not limited to affordability
However, students who complete their education are far less likely to find themselves held back by debt. #GOPFuture
The average student who graduates with debt leaves campus owing around $30,000, 43% of Americans with federal loans are not making payments
The cost for attending a Public 4-year rose ~2.8% per year over the last decade while simultaneously family incomes decreased .2% per year
Today‚Äôs students are coming of age during a turbulent time in American history. There remains a climate of rapidly rising tuition #GOPFuture
Today we will discuss #highereducation, a topic that fills our news cycles and is discussed at kitchen tables across the country #GOPFuture
Millennials are using technology to empower themselves in ways previous generations never could  #GOPFuture
We discussed the ways millennials are changing the  workforce and how companies are adapting to the unique skill sets of this generation.
We've heard from millennials who shared real world examples of the challenges facing what will soon be half of the American workforce
Example: millennials are the most highly educated generation in US history yet they also feel the most politically disengaged #GOPFuture
We've reviewed current trends and data that show this generation is different in many ways from their parents &amp; grandparents #GOPFuture
This hearing is the 4th in a series where we discussed the pressing issues facing the largest generation in our workforce #GOPFuture
It's an honor to once again chair the #MillennialTaskforce in our ongoing conversation on how we can help empower the millennial generation.
Starting shortly: @GOPpolicy #MillennialTaskForce hearing on College Completion, Flexibility, and Affordability https://t.co/58pgMulTAL

I look forward to an informative and productive dialogue as we discuss how we can support and grow the empowerment economy #GOPFuture
Past generations have looked for stability &amp; certainty where millennials look for flexibility &amp; fulfillment. Shift will make the US stronger
With this new generation, as with all generations, come new ways of doing things and fresh outlooks on the world around us. #GOPFuture
For companies to stay competitive they'll need to  harness the  experiences &amp; energy of a generation that includes 80 million Americans
Millennials have surpassed Generation X as the largest generation in the US labor force--1 in 3 US workers today is a millennial #GOPFuture
