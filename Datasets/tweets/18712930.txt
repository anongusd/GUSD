I really don't want to call out the artist who scammed me out of $80 (they have a twitter account), because of the unnecessary drama it'll bring. But I'll DM it to whomever wants to know. I have a receipt for payment, and email comms as evidence that I'm not making it up.
You know that person I paid $80 up front for an overlay re-design last April? Still hasn't provided it; still hasn't given a refund.
@owillis So people still haven't heard about DOOM: Eternal?
@NoThanksIRS You seem to be under the impression that living/residing within the 50 States means you're not within the federal government's jurisdiction.
@NoThanksIRS Do you not know how Constitutional Amendments work?
@NoThanksIRS You don't get to opt out of the law just by saying so or submitting a letter to the IRS or your county clerk's office.
Listening to this makes me want to play again lol https://t.co/XQTjEyLiq9
@NoThanksIRS And that's exactly what I expected to read from those who want to save face and claim victory when they have nothing left üòÇ
@NoThanksIRS I've already demonstrated my burden. Your lack of understanding of the case's holding, or in the alternative your denial of its meaning, is not my problem.
@NoThanksIRS yes it does. That that the court isn't using your exact phrasing doesn't make it untrue.
@NoThanksIRS Already provided, denialist: "All individuals, freeborn and nonfreeborn, natural and unnatural alike, must pay federal income tax on their wages, regardless of whether they have requested, obtained or exercised any privilege from the federal government.‚Äù	Sloan, 939 F.2d at 501.
@NoThanksIRS Gonna give you a hint in that the court isn't going to think it's funny if you're going to be this obtuse and intellectually dishonest.
@NoThanksIRS Because it's clear that you're engaging in denialism. When folks are asserting your arguments as evidence of not having any tax obligations, and the courts reject it, THEY'RE REJECTING YOUR ARGUMENT
@NoThanksIRS Keep telling yourself that
@LadyM3033 @NoThanksIRS The 50 States are apart of the United States. This is 3rd grade civics. You trying to claim you're a "citizen of Washington State" and not a US citizen has been debunked ad nauseum in the courts. But y'all just go "nuh uh!" Right until they fine u another $5k
@LadyM3033 @NoThanksIRS "crown" corporation? Lol that's a new one
@NoThanksIRS Ahhhhhahahaha. Article I Gives Congress the power to tax. The Supremacy Clause means that Congress's laws on taxation are applicable to all as a general rule. Try again
@NoThanksIRS of course I'm referring to US law. I'm referencing the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution
@NoThanksIRS Again, Supremacy Clause. This is basic grade school civics. So now you're claiming that the law doesn't apply to everyone. Who, pray tell, is among this special class that gets to choose what laws they wish to follow?
@NoThanksIRS Supremacy Clause. Have a nice day
@NoThanksIRS it's a fundamental fact that the laws of the US apply to all within its jurisdiction as a general rule, US citizen or not. That's subject to certain exceptions. You haven't identified any regarding the tax code
@NoThanksIRS Keep telling yourself that. The income tax applies to individuals. It's not limited only to US citizens. This is defined by the code itself unless you think H1B visa holders don't have to pay income tax
@NoThanksIRS are you claiming that federal laws don't apply to everyone in the US as a general rule?
@NoThanksIRS so I'll take it you have no response and are conceding, since you think that a case has to frame it's holding using your precise phrase in order to be satisfactory.

@TerranomaLead @NoThanksIRS What does being "European descendant Americans" have ANYTHING to do with this discussion? Are you asserting the tax code isn't being applied equally to said Americans? If so how? What about non-European descendants? They're not afforded equal protection?
@TerranomaLead @NoThanksIRS Okay. And the Magna Carta has fuck all to do with the IRS tax code.
@TerranomaLead @NoThanksIRS You got that docket number for me?
THIS. THIS IS WHY. https://t.co/07RRQ8NRoP
@TerranomaLead @NoThanksIRS And...hold up did you seriously cite the Magna Carta in relevance to US law?
@NoThanksIRS "Mr. Sloan‚Äôs proposition that he is not subject to the jurisdiction of the laws of the United States is simply wrong.‚Äù Sloan, 939 F.2d at 501.
@NoThanksIRS "Moreover, the tax code imposes a ‚Äúdirect nonapportioned [income] tax upon United States citizens throughout the nation, not just in federal enclaves,‚Äù such as postal offices and Indian reservations." United States v. Sloan, 939 F.2d 499, 501 (7th Cir. 1991).
@NoThanksIRS For once, we actually agree. For Puerto Ricans, birthright citizenship is conferred by Congress via statute. I would know. But we're not talking about just Puerto Ricans, are we?

I'm back in NJ yaaaaaay
@DovaQueenx nevermind, lol
@NoThanksIRS With the exception of Puerto Rico and other limited circumstances, birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. Holy Balls, you need to fix your research skills!
@NoThanksIRS oh no. Hahahaha! A US Non-Citizen National is a limited status reserved for those in a few US territories like American Samoa. THAT'S IT. If you were born in one of the US States, Puerto Rico, and other territories and US installations, you're a birthright Citizen

@LadyM3033 @TerranomaLead @NoThanksIRS No court anywhere had ever agreed to your comical definition of citizenship, or that telling yourself you're not a citizen but a Sovereign/Freeborn/Natural Living Man/Woman has ever worked in getting to opt out of the system or obligations for living in the US.
@DovaQueenx So you do you like, have a sister, or...? And if so is she in the tristate area? Lol
@LadyM3033 @TerranomaLead @NoThanksIRS Wrong. US Citizenship is conferred by birthright. It has fuck all to do with working for the federal government. You got your info from the Internet and SovCit wootard forums. Get your life together please

@TerranomaLead @NoThanksIRS no, the income tax is not reserved solely for federal personnel. Seriously stop you're embarrassing yourself
@NoThanksIRS how else did I find your twitter account? :D. I deal with SovCits mostly, but because they like to incorporate tax protestor arguments, I get a kick from y'all as well

@NoThanksIRS also, learn to fallacy correctly
@NoThanksIRS lol no. I pay my taxes. I've never been scammed by folks like you. I just don't like scammers is all.
@NoThanksIRS zero understanding of court precedent, no rebuttals to court decisions which contact your assertions, lack of comprehension of statutory and regulatory interpretation of definitions. You really have nothing that have already been dismantled and debunked

@NoThanksIRS Condescension noted, scammer.
@NoThanksIRS you keep telling yourself that as I continue to cite binding precedent not coming from SCOTUS.
@NoThanksIRS note I said Circuit Courts .
@NoThanksIRS so i hit the nail on the head. Don't file a return and just pretend you don't have to because someone on the internet said so. And when you're fined by the IRS or worse don't expect them to come help you out
@NoThanksIRS lmao no. Circuit Court decisions are binding or else they wouldn't be citing each other
@NoThanksIRS so then is your scam to just tell people not to file a return and hope the IRS doesn't notice? Because if you don't file, then they can't say you earned income amirite? Lol
