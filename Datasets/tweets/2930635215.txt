Tonight, I look forward to hearing from my friends and colleagues in the Congressional @WesternCaucus on why the #GreenNewDeal would be catastrophic for their constituents and what we should really be prioritizing in order to continue America‚Äôs energy independence dominance. https://t.co/fgP7MRmmhx
Not once is the word ‚Äúhydropower‚Äù mentioned in the legislation, and the ‚ÄúFrequently Asked Questions‚Äù document released to accompany the introduction of the #GreenNewDeal stated that ‚Äúthe plan is to transition off of nuclear‚Ä¶‚Äù
It also comes from our use of nuclear power. The Columbia Generating Station, which is also in the 4th Congressional District I represent, is the only nuclear power plant in the greater Northwest region. It, too, provides clean, reliable power for the Pacific Northwest.
Nearly 70% of WA's power comes from hydropower, a clean, renewable, reliable, and affordable source of baseload energy.
The great State of Washington consistently ranks at the top of the list of states with the cleanest energy production--Because of strong reliance on our incredible system of hydroelectric dams, many of which are in my Congressional District along the Columbia and Snake Rivers.
By expanding our federal bureaucracy far beyond anything we have ever seen in history and undermining the federalist principles our country was founded upon in the Constitution, the #GreenNewDeal would jeopardize the future of America as we know it. https://t.co/UMjYqOwsq2
This so-called ‚Äúdeal‚Äù calls for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero in only 10 years‚Äîone independent estimate led by a team of Stanford engineers suggests it would cost our nation at least $7 trillion to convert all of America‚Äôs power to renewable power. https://t.co/hqGwX5g8n7
