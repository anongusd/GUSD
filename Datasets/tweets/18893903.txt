@realDonaldTrump Hey Mr. Trump, just because we still have winter, cold and snow doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt have global warming. Have some scientists read their research studies to you since you don‚Äôt read. I don‚Äôt know about you, but I would like our grandchildren to be able to live on our planet.
@GavinNewsom @CA_Dem Trump is a dictator. He has destroyed our democracy. Once Kavanaugh squeaked in, there are no more checks or balances on Trump‚Äôs radical behavior and power grabs. Our only hope is Mueller or a non corrupt election in 2020 if we even make it that far. I‚Äôm not betting the farm.
