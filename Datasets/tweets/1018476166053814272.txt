@Drifter12552121 @Franklin_Graham You realize we share similar viewpoints- I say abortion should be legal sometimes, you just take it further.
@Drifter12552121 @Franklin_Graham By my morality it is justifiable- this doesn't mean I support on demand abortion, there should be a reason- medical, financial, etc.

@Drifter12552121 @Franklin_Graham But there is. It is based on what you base your morality on.
@Drifter12552121 @Franklin_Graham Lovely how law does that isn't it? That law would be wrong as abortion isn't legally defined as murder.
@Drifter12552121 @Franklin_Graham Per Lincoln-Douglas rules (the type of debate this is) by not providing your definition of life you have accpeted mine- BTW.
@Drifter12552121 @Franklin_Graham An abortion is not a car crash.
@Drifter12552121 @Franklin_Graham And?
@Drifter12552121 @Franklin_Graham Because legally abortion isn't murder, and i base my morality off of law and science, not religion	https://t.co/4JdOZiRfw3
@Drifter12552121 @Franklin_Graham What if the mother kills herself- would you consider that killing the baby- the action you want to prevent.
@Drifter12552121 @Franklin_Graham But they are important to the debate- this amounts to conceeding the debate.
@Drifter12552121 @Franklin_Graham 1. You still haven't defined life.	2. Should a woman be forced to carry a fetus she doesn't want?	-Compared to receiving an abortion,	being denied a wanted abortion was	associated with experiencing more	symptoms of anxiety and low selfesteem one week after denial.

@Drifter12552121 @Franklin_Graham You STILL haven't defined living, it's like you're afraid to do so.

@Drifter12552121 @Franklin_Graham Are you just using the Beethoven argument?
@Drifter12552121 @Franklin_Graham You still haven't defined living.
@Drifter12552121 @Franklin_Graham Not or no longer desired. Though you and I agree- after a fetus is viable to survive outside the womb.
@Drifter12552121 @Franklin_Graham I require your definition of living.

@Drifter12552121 @Franklin_Graham The hairs are the substance- the important part of the debate. So I shall split hairs.
@Drifter12552121 @Franklin_Graham The important part is that legally a heartbeat doesn't equal being alive.

@Drifter12552121 @Franklin_Graham death creates a situation where science deviates from their politics and faith. They believe that a heartbeat equals life. Brain death—which is considered true, legal death by broad medical consensus and the laws of all 50 states 2/2
@Drifter12552121 @Franklin_Graham And here we see the problem.

They believe that a heartbeat equals life. Brain 1/2
