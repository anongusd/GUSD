ICYMI RELEASE: Paulsen Backs Legislation to Empower Patients and Lower Health Care Costs: https://t.co/MJyBNImZ7U
More than 20 millions Americans use HSAs, including 800,000 Minnesotans; nearly 30% of filers make less than $75,000
It is great to see HSAs included in our health care reform bc they're proven to lower drug and health care costs
In MN last year, we had‚Ä¶		- 4th-highest premium hike in US at 59%	- More than 100,000 Minnesotans lose coverage	- Less choice on MNsure
We are rescuing patients and providing them with immediate relief through the American Health Care Act		#ReadTheBill https://t.co/ch1GsUcs8V
