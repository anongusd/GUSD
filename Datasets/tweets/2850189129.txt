Change would make it easier for landowners in Ag Reserve to sell, and developers like GL would have an easier time meeting preservation rule
Rule change would allow smaller parcels that don't abut others in preservation to be used in the development calculations.
Preserve parcels must be at least 150 acres and abut other preserved parcels.
To build in the Ag Reserve, a developer must set aside 1.5 acres for every 1 acre that would be developed.
