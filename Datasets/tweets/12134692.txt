Of course, it's possible that there really ARE credible threats of violence at pro sports events all around the country every day. But no one's actually demonstrated that. So maybe instead of security theater, we could all just... bring our bags to games like we've always done?
What this really seems to be is a decision that it's faster to screen people with small bags that don't have lots of compartments, and that it's better to just make the rules be inconvenient (or provide lockers) than it is to have people waiting in long security lines.
This is the same thing D.C. United is doing this season, too. But if you're worried about bombs, wouldn't it also be bad for someone to blow up their backpack while it's ... locked up right by the stadium?

@Reen910 @joltdude @s_leischner @MannKindCorp Sure, maybe; I don't know, I haven't done the math because I'm not interested in using it. I don't really see why you're responding to the (good) news that there's now a cheaper generic Humalog by telling other people to switch their insulin regimen.
@Reen910 @joltdude @s_leischner @MannKindCorp If you want to use Afrezza, that's great. But a lot of other T1D people use different therapies. The fact that Afrezza is $4/day isn't really relevant to those of us who don't use it.
@Reen910 @joltdude @s_leischner @MannKindCorp Yes, that's certainly true, which is why the additional high cost of injectable insulin is a problem for so many people.
@Reen910 @joltdude @s_leischner @MannKindCorp I'm glad that works for you. I've been using a pump for more than 25 years and a CGM for 10 and am happy with them, too. Insulin of all forms and delivery mechanisms should be affordable.
@Reen910 @joltdude @s_leischner @MannKindCorp You don't ordinarily need a long-lasting insulin if you use a pump, except for backup, and you also can't use Afrezza as your primary insulin if you use a pump. So while it's good they're lowering prices, that doesn't solve all insulin the pricing problems.

@KennethBaer My theory on baseball team owners' money remains pretty much that they have more than enough of it, which is why I still think the Nats should both re-sign Harper and re-sign Rendon and pay whatever the luxury tax bill is. But I realize that's not how it really works.
@KennethBaer ... but only if they take more than the "stupid" amount of money you guys offered to play somewhere else
In some cities, fans boo players who leave their team to sign big contracts somewhere else. Booing players who NEVER PLAYED FOR YOUR TEAM because they dared to sign somewhere else takes a certain spirit only found in the City of Brotherly Love.

@KennethBaer @dcunited The bag rules this season are, theoretically, less restrictive than the ones from last season (last season, all bags had to be clear), so I think this is meant to be an improvement.
@KennethBaer @dcunited At Audi Field, I assume it has to do with whatever the insurance policy is -- new stadium, new rules. No idea why the Nats are on board with this nonsense now, too, though.
Update: My season ticket rep at @dcunited says clear backpack that meets the size requirements should be allowed in. (Let's hope that's true! And/or that I can talk my kids into not bringing any stuff with them on Sunday and we can use the no bag line.)
@abeaujon I assume it all boils down to their insurer requiring some security theater, but it's still pretty silly.
Hey @dcunited, does your new bag policy mean the 14x14x6 clear backpack that I bought to comply with LAST year's bag policy will no longer be allowed in, since it's a backpack, not a "cinch/drawstring bag?" https://t.co/m3TFnyhx8v

@MelissaTweets I don't know that any local news organization would have felt like staking out his house was worth it (and also, no, local reporters in Florida are probably not closely following Mueller's grand jury proceedings). The video is pretty lousy, after all.
@MelissaTweets If someone in law enforcement wanted the press there, why would they only tip off CNN?
@MelissaTweets It's pretty easy to see how they did it: Stone's been saying for weeks (months?) he thought Mueller would try to indict him. The grand jury met yesterday, when they usually meet on Fridays. CNN has a Miami bureau and plenty of people available to stake out his house.
That CNN video from Roger Stone's house was published less than six hours ago, and the false theory that they were tipped off by law enforcement is already so widely circulating among supporters of President Trump's that it's just considered an obvious fact. Things move fast.
