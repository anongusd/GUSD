@USofA_mom @KateSteinleRise @BenHowe @Evan_McMullin On this we agree. I'd love if murders and rapists wore self-identifying tshirts, too.
@USofA_mom @KateSteinleRise @BenHowe @Evan_McMullin I will. Jesus commanded I do.
@USofA_mom @KateSteinleRise @BenHowe @Evan_McMullin I'm defending my right to vote whomever I choose...thanks for your insight though.
@USofA_mom @KateSteinleRise @BenHowe @Evan_McMullin oh, and I'm not voting for @Evan_McMullin but I did look into it..
@USofA_mom @KateSteinleRise @BenHowe @Evan_McMullin I'm actually defending people that are NOT terrorists
@KateSteinleRise @BenHowe @sociopathmovie @Evan_McMullin So people should be judged based on the luck, good or bad, of where they are born?

@KateSteinleRise @BenHowe @sociopathmovie @Evan_McMullin And you have personal knowledge of his sex life?
@KateSteinleRise @BenHowe @sociopathmovie @Evan_McMullin So you consider Mormon a derogatory term? Certainly not been my experience
