Trump has 65 billion at his disposal right now to build the wall through army of engineers by declaring an emergency in the name of national security. All he is doing is showing Congress I want to work with you. I had no choice you wouldn't work with me reasonably. #pedogate

@VeganMikey @RandomRantsofRy @kadath123 @KappyD5 @AnOpenSecret I'm just saying put this damn thing behind you and address it.
@VeganMikey @RandomRantsofRy @kadath123 @KappyD5 @AnOpenSecret When you lie about this people assume you will lie about other things. Come clean and save yourself.  Patreon shut it down because they know about the warrant. It's all about liability for companies.
@VeganMikey @RandomRantsofRy @kadath123 @KappyD5 @AnOpenSecret So your denying you don't have a warrant? He showed it. Look at it this way you lied about the warrant, that has been proven. Does that mean that story you told didn't happen? No but it looks bad when you refuse to come clean on this.
@RandomRantsofRy @kadath123 @KappyD5 @VeganMikey @AnOpenSecret I am going to die laughing Greg if Ryan opens his books and proves no payments have come from Hoffman.üòÇüòÜ Becareful what you wish for.ü§î
@RandomRantsofRy @kadath123 @KappyD5 @VeganMikey @AnOpenSecret I am just wanting the truth thats it. Come forward and address these claims Ryan is making with what he has brought forward.

@RandomRantsofRy @kadath123 @KappyD5 @VeganMikey @AnOpenSecret Until people show different Ryan has brought out real substance. He has hit this shit point by point. I also thought he was going off a deep end. But he keeps showing the dots are connecting. These people need to come out and address these claims.
@RandomRantsofRy @kadath123 @KappyD5 @VeganMikey @AnOpenSecret We just don't agree on everything. There is nothing wrong with that. So many damn trolls would not be coming out of the damn woodwork, if he was not over a target. FACT
@RandomRantsofRy @kadath123 @KappyD5 @VeganMikey @AnOpenSecret I will say this so many people do not like Ryan personally. Yet who also is like this Donald Trump. So many people watch Ryan not for his personality but because of what he is showing and breaking it down point by point. I personally don't have anything against him.

@VeganMikey @AnOpenSecret @RandomRantsofRy I know an open secret is compromised.  I did research on Ryan. He is just a good researcher and wants the truth that's it and has a lawn care company.
@VeganMikey @AnOpenSecret @RandomRantsofRy This does not mean Mikeys story is not true, however this does not make him look good if he doesn't come on Twitter live and address it.
@VeganMikey @AnOpenSecret @RandomRantsofRy Ryan gave the case number etc so it can be verified that he does have an outstanding warrant.
@VeganMikey @AnOpenSecret @RandomRantsofRy Here is what I think. I might not agree with Ryan on everyrthing he does. He has made some good points. You are technically are an accessory to a crime for everyone of you that has sent money. I think that's why it was shut down. Patron does not want to be legally liable.

This is going to be everything and the kitchen sink. I have seen so many Patriots who have been indoctrinated and they need to hear something different and start connecting the dots. Trump can't do it by himself folks. #Trump #Russia #Censorship #PEDOGATE
I am not against all alternative media and I still like some shows who continue to ignore me because this does not interest them for whatever reason that might be .I will give an opinion, but most of the time I will back it with research. #MAGA #Russia #trump #PEDOGATE
I will be doing a show called The  Political Italian Patriot Show. This is the name I will probably launch with. I will be providing more details as they become available. #MAGA #Censorship #trump #Russia #PEDOGATE
God has given all people a miracle. We finally very soon will have a no censorship platform. I made the decision after being brushed off for the last time. I am going to report things no one talks about and going to be different from everyone else.#MAGA #Censorship #Pedogate
With my small following all of my predictions have become true even before POTUS said he was going to run. I have a few people on my Twitter who can verify this is all true. Only thing I have been wrong on is the exact time frame. #MAGA #Trump #Censorship #PEDOGATE
I have finally decided it will be time for me to come forward in early 2019 and  Spill It! I have supported POTUS almost 24 years. I know someone who flies with him on airforce one. He is my hero in business before he came President. #MAGA #Trump #PEDOGATE
.Yet he can't debunk it. And he waited until I was off the line to brush me aside so I couldn't respond I am tired of being ignored. They tell you to reach out and they never respond back to you. #MAGA  #Russia #Censorship #Trump #PEDOGATE
. I finally got through on someone's show and I was brushed aside. I still like the show but the host is a hypocrite, when he disagrees with you. He didn't research anything. #MAGA #Censorship #RussiaGate #Russia #JeffreyEpstein #PEDOGATE
I have no problem with people profiting, after all this is America. The greatest country on the planet, however we do have major problems. Many People are being paid by the deep State posing as truthers. Or its just all about profit. #ClearFlynnNow #Censorship #MAGA #PEDOGATE
I must be right which is why they continue to censor me, however I'm not big enough to be taken off Twitter. We have so many psyops in Alternative Media it's insane.  #MAGA #trump #WWG1WGA #Censorship #RussiaGate #Russia #PEDOGATE #ClearFlynnNow
After spending lots of time watching alternative media, I am very disappointed that no one covers what I know.  With my small following it is very hard to gain traction due to censorship. My following is so small because what I say is so damaging. #trump #PEDOGATE #RussiaGate

@vincedemello @mflynnJR I never said I have evidence of that. All I wanted to show a pattern of crimes that happened in that county. You real are a one of a kind twat waffle  Why the fuck do I even waste my time talking to you ?üôÑ

@vincedemello @mflynnJR Because the corruption is so massive. In both parties in this county She was convicted by a judge. This is all a public record. They will prosecute this time. Just give it some time the evidence is there but they haven't been to court yet since it just happened.
@vincedemello @mflynnJR She was convicted
@vincedemello @mflynnJR How is destroying ballots by Brenda Snipes and company not evidence of fraud?
@vincedemello @mflynnJR She owns the Democrat party she would run under an indictment. She will run again

@vincedemello @TomiLahren If we don't see arrests in the house and Senate in both parties I'm done and I will no longer be a voter.
@vincedemello @TomiLahren No it isn't they can't stop him from doing that. Senate confirms those people not the house.
@vincedemello @TomiLahren Clinton was controlled by Russia getting paid millions by Russian banks doing speeches. That evidence is there.
@vincedemello @TomiLahren I think it's Isreal what your saying is absolute nonsense no evidence of any of it.
@vincedemello @TomiLahren Then I will no longer be a voter for any party and I'll just be done with all of it.
@vincedemello @TomiLahren If anyone could change it I thought Trump could but if it doesn't happen. This is all for entertainment and it means nothing.
@vincedemello @TomiLahren If I do not see theses arrests I will not be voting for Trump in 2020 either. I do not blame Trump but it will show someone is controlling Trump as well. And that is the end of the republic.
@vincedemello @TomiLahren We should have several special elections due to congressmen and senators in BOTH parties committing treason.
@vincedemello @TomiLahren If we do not see arrests in BOTH parties between Jan and June 2019. I will no longer believe in the system anymore. Nothing will change both parties it's all a show.
@vincedemello @TomiLahren Trump will fire Rosenstein and Sessions now.
@vincedemello @TomiLahren Mueller will bring back nothing. Just more millions of our money will be wasted.  Trump will not release those returns Trump will probably fire Mueller shortly if no report comes this month.
@vincedemello @TomiLahren This was probably my very last vote as a voter.
@vincedemello @TomiLahren Dems can now start up a lot of nonsense with subpoena power. Tax dollars will continue to get wasted with this nonsense looking into Trump. This unhealthy obsession and yet he goes nowhere.
@vincedemello @TomiLahren I said I was surprised. I was wrong. It's been a long time since I was wrong.
@vincedemello @TomiLahren It wasn't a blue wave we expanded in the senate. If you pay any attention at all these trends have always been typical with a president of the other party.  I am surprised for sure.  It was only 23 seats . Trump is going no where. Nothing gets done. 2 years gridlock. I'm excited
