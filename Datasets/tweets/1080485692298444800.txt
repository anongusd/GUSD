Family-owned farming operations have provided a high quality of life not only for rural areas, but for our whole nation, for hundreds of years. If small farms perish, so will a quintessential aspect of American life. https://t.co/WnC98vj83g
After a wholly inadequate response from @USDA Secretary Perdue at a hearing this week on supporting small farms, I invited him to NY-19 to hear directly from farmers whose livelihoods have been jeopardized by low prices, market consolidation &amp; lack of access to local resources. https://t.co/zhvp9g4SLN
Proud to stand with Hoosick Falls’ Michael Hickey today to introduce the WATER Act, which will do real good for communities here in Upstate NY. It provides funding for rural communities’ water infrastructure and communities affected by PFAS/PFOA contamination. 		Watch: https://t.co/dA4i9AC4Us
Proud to stand with @PPFA in opposing this gag rule. Placing limits on the info medical community can provide to women seeking reproductive services is completely unethical &amp; another dangerous attack from this Administration on affordable health care. https://t.co/uYIVdv2fAC
I heard a lot last week from self-employed folks in rural parts of our district who run their own businesses and struggle with access to capital. At today’s @HouseSmallBiz hearing I asked about what we can do to better support them. 	Watch an excerpt here: https://t.co/Ya94rdnnxX
The gun lobby has too long had a stronghold over Congress; today’s vote is a big step forward in breaking that status quo and keeping our communities safe.
In passing #HR8 today, bipartisan Members of Congress took the most significant step towards gun safety that we have seen in years, finally achieving universal background checks while ensuring reasonable provisions for family transfers. https://t.co/WI5yLCjfSl
Thanks to leaders of @TCFDiscovery for coming by today! They provide such life-changing services to people with complex conditions—it was great to see them again and hear about their upcoming work. https://t.co/mNV8Sr4K2A
Members of the House of Representatives on both sides of the aisle did the right thing by blocking the declaration—I hope that Senators will stand up for the rule of law and follow our lead.
The power of appropriations lies exclusively in the hands of Congress. The President’s decision to do an end run around Congress and declare a national emergency is deeply alarming and violates the separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution. https://t.co/QpqBiIMTsG
Very pleased I'll be voting today for the #PublicLands bill that will protect sites across the country &amp; allow the FDR National Historic Site in Hyde Park to acquire additional land. Great that this law will support expanding and preserving such a treasured place in our district.
@HudsonCSD @MCSBluehawks You are more than welcome to use the photos! Please send us a direct message if you have additional questions and our Communications Director can be in touch. --Office of Congressman Delgado
Great to be at this morning’s @TransportDems hearing, focused on how we can invest in roads and water infrastructure in a way that also addresses climate change. https://t.co/RyQiao4ou0
Honored to be commencement speaker at my alma matter @colgateuniv. Wouldn’t be where I am today if it weren't for classmates, teammates, professors, friends &amp; mentors I met there. Thrilled to address graduating class &amp; celebrate Colgate’s Bicentennial Year https://t.co/cnQxiA3xm6
This Friday is National Read Across America Day, so I stopped by @MCSBluehawks in Hudson to drop off books that my office got from the Library of Congress. Really fun to read to these kids and get a chance to tour the school! #ReadAcrossAmerica https://t.co/XoRCMgdmxp
Proud to be a cosponsor of the bipartisan Never Forget the Heroes: Permanent Authorization of the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund Act. 9/11 first responders and survivors deserve nothing less than full and permanent funding of this program. #Renew911VCF https://t.co/xOiQoViRwz

Had a great start to the day talking with government students at @RVCSD. At a time when our political system is too often failing us, it's young people like the ones I spoke to today who are going to revitalize our democracy. Really inspiring conversations this morning. https://t.co/9iEi2SdhOw
Joined the @NYFarmBureau for its Mid-Winter Regional Meeting in Kingston, part of our focus on ag issues during our 1st in-district work period. Really enjoyed hearing from folks about what issues they think are getting overlooked in Congress that I can bring more attention to. https://t.co/3IIw8tyyxZ
Stopped by @RadioKingstonNY to record a podcast episode with @YoungFarmers Executive Director @LLShute -- stay tuned for when it airs! https://t.co/HcClrz1F8t
Serving on not just the Agriculture and Transportation and Infrastructure Committees but the Small Business Committee as well gives me a real platform to be a strong advocate for the economic needs of our district.
Thanks to the Ulster County Regional Chamber of Commerce for having me at their breakfast this morning. In Congress I’m committed to supporting our Upstate economy by empowering entrepreneurs, growing small businesses, and enabling our workforce. https://t.co/d1DcwZqkkc

Glad to join Delaware County Farm Bureau President Duane Martin for a tour of Del-Rose Farm led by Barb Hanselman, and thanks to everyone who came out to our roundtable today. Great to hear from folks throughout the area including a few who are 8th and 9th generation farmers!
As the representative for the third most rural Congressional district held by a Democrat and eighth most rural district in the country -- and as a member of the @HouseAgDems -- I‘m focusing my first in-district work period on connecting with farmers across NY-19. https://t.co/UGaPAD4vEv
Council members also flagged the need to clarify recent law impacting Blue Water Navy Vietnam Vets. Lastly, we discussed implementation of VA Mission Act, lack of home health aides in rural areas, &amp; the pitfalls associated with the VA subcontracting compensation &amp; pension exams.
Great meeting today with our Veterans Advisory Council. We discussed the need to rethink the current policy around caring for our veterans, which does not sufficiently address non-combat related risks, including exposure to toxins from burn pits. https://t.co/J03MwbM7zk

At a @HouseSmallBiz hearing, I talked about investing in our communities so farmers &amp; business owners can expand their markets. I started by sharing experiences of a family-owned farm in Otsego County that often drives up to 5 hrs to deliver its products. https://t.co/ZWgn34W2My
I wrote to the Department of Defense and Department of the Navy earlier this week, and I introduced a bipartisan resolution to honor Chief Kent and urge the Department of Defense and Department of the Navy to review their policies: https://t.co/mJi1j8HLcc https://t.co/EehNuNgIIn
Before she was killed, Chief Kent was working to change this flawed system, not just for herself, but for all members of the Armed Services. And now I'm working to understand what happened in Chief Kent's case, and what can be done to make sure it doesn't happen again.
Before she went on her final deployment to Syria, she wanted to enlist in a Ph.D. program -- but because she was a survivor of thyroid cancer, she was disqualified. Clearly something went wrong: How could she be fit to deploy in a combat zone but not to enter a Ph.D. program?
I went to the House floor to honor the memory of Chief Shannon M. Kent, who is from Pine Plains and gave the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country. https://t.co/NA4diEKRvo
We're doing six town halls during the upcoming in-district work period! The first one is tomorrow in Columbia County, at the Kellner Community Center in Germantown from 2 - 3 PM. Hope you can join! And you can see the full list of upcoming town halls at https://t.co/0fxflstwGn.
Unsurprisingly, the terms of the agreement are far from perfect, but the bipartisan legislation does avert another harmful shutdown and allows us to get back to the important work we were sent here to do.
I’m pleased that Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate came to an agreement to fund the government. However, that such an agreement could only be reached with the threat of yet another government shutdown is an indictment of our failing political system.
Happy Valentine's Day! Lacey &amp; Maxwell today delivered all the valentines that kids across the district made to veterans at ArchCare at Ferncliff Nursing Home and Rehabilitation Center. The veterans loved the cards--thanks to everyone who made them! https://t.co/DQyPvuPkYA
This weekend starts our 1st in-district work period, so I'll be home all week, meeting w/ folks &amp; bringing their ideas with me back to Washington. I'll be holding 6 town halls -- I look forward to hearing your questions &amp; hope you can join! Details here: https://t.co/puoZtRAIPt
Her commitment to ensuring that America live up to the promise of equality for all paved the way for my own journey to becoming the first African American congressman to serve Upstate New York.
A truly humbling experience to honor the life of the great Sojourner Truth on the House floor during #BlackHistoryMonth. https://t.co/qAuMODutXB
Glad to cosponsor bipartisan bill to eliminate SALT cap. The 2017 tax law irresponsibly added more than $1 trillion to deficit while creating the cap that results in double taxation for middle- &amp; working-class families. Repealing it is right thing to do. https://t.co/yNDi5JAVqq
This week is National Salute to Veteran Patients Week – an opportunity to express our appreciation for the brave men &amp; women who have defended our nation and get involved in supporting them. Interested in volunteering in our area? Details here: https://t.co/sp9wXLrnfn
The organization's Executive Director, Lindsey, owns and operates a 900-member CSA farm in Columbia County. Families like hers are what make our farming communities so strong.
Today I sat down with @YoungFarmers to hear about #FarmBill programs to help farmers sell their products at farmers markets and support new and beginning farmers in our region. https://t.co/4qmWuqWTM3
Given today's weather, our Delhi office will be closed but doors are open at our Kingston office at 256 Clinton Ave. Stay safe, stay warm!
I welcome Rep. Omar’s apology and hope that moving forward we can all engage on these matters in a non-divisive fashion and with an eye towards mutual understanding.
Reducing the alliance between the U.S. and Israel to being all about money is historically inaccurate; evokes ugly stereotypes, intentionally or otherwise; and ignores the ties forged by shared interests, values and generations of Jewish families, including my own.
One of my favorite questions at last week's town hall in Sullivan County was about how we should go about addressing climate change. This is an urgent issue that requires bold action, and one of my priorities is to create new green jobs here in Upstate New York. https://t.co/vyvRSEjuOI
The House of Representatives today passed the Veterans' Access to Child Care Act, which included two amendments I introduced. Watch my remarks on one of these amendments, a bipartisan measure to ensure that emergency mental health services are included in the bill. https://t.co/Obx0gpml9E
In parts of my district, I drive by large signs that read, “broadband coming soon.” It’s a sight that is hard to imagine in NY, in the USA, in the 21st century. During a @HouseSmallBiz hearing today, I emphasized importance of expanding rural broadband:	https://t.co/VYA8g1UZgY
Thank you to the White Sulphur Springs Fire Department for their work extinguishing this fire.
There is no place for religious discrimination in our country. This investigation of a barn fire &amp; anti-Semitic graffiti is a painful reminder that it is up to all of us to stand together against hate and bigotry. https://t.co/LoQ5WhM2s2
At both meetings, I was glad to hear more about the crucial work they provide to rural communities in Upstate New York and how we can best ensure that folks have access to affordable health care they need and deserve.
Today I had the chance to sit down with leaders of the New York State Association for Rural Health as well as @HRHCare, a network of community health centers in our region. https://t.co/vsT6NHCZkw
Today was my 1st hearing as a Member of Congress. The govt shutdown has created uncertainty for many in my district working to make ends meet. During @HouseSmallBiz hearing, I highlighted conversations I had w/ local farmers &amp; small biz owners on shutdown https://t.co/6CNBTvbDJk
Reminder: We are going to be delivering valentines to veterans in our community on Friday! We made some with the boys over the weekend, and we’d love to bring yours with us. Drop off your cards at our Kingston office: 256 Clinton Ave, Kingston, NY 12401. https://t.co/aj7DvRTm4e
Day-in and day-out, I will continue to prioritize protecting our water infrastructure and other critical matters that I hear from the people of my district, from expanding rural broadband to supporting our farmers to improving access to quality health care.
Issues like these that directly affect Upstate New York are what I’m focused on as a Member of Congress. That’s why I brought Michael Hickey as my guest, a hero in our community who brought to light the water contamination crisis we know today in Hoosick Falls.
While I wish the President’s speech had focused more on what brings us together, I was glad to hear him discuss some key issues that I think we can all agree to prioritize, like reducing the price of prescription drugs and strengthening our infrastructure.
The State of the Union is a time for the President to reflect upon the shared goals of our nation and how Congress and the Administration can best serve the people.
Thank you Michael Hickey for joining me for tonight’s State of the Union. You exemplify what it means to do right by your community. I look forward to many more conversations about working together to address water contamination in Hoosick Falls, Petersburgh &amp; across the country. https://t.co/9DetqkQesw
At the Delhi office opening, I made one thing very clear: There can't be another shutdown. I've heard from countless constituents who were personally affected by the shutdown. Another shutdown would be beyond reckless--communities here can't afford it. https://t.co/4HQesKh9zf

Busy afternoon in Oneonta! I sat down with local members of the @YoungFarmers to hear about ways to bring their priorities to Washington as a member of the Agriculture Committee. I then met with the Otsego Electric Cooperative to discuss rural broadband access. https://t.co/gKUdDtJMGd
Thanks to everyone who came out to our Delhi office opening. We said from Day One that we were committed to opening offices across the district to ensure accessibility &amp; transparency. The office, at 111 Main St, will be open Tuesdays &amp; Wednesdays 10 AM - 4 PM &amp; by appointment. https://t.co/7bvXKFdnd5
I am committed to working w/ members on both sides of the aisle to take decisive steps to address water contamination. And I will be a strong voice urging the Administration to step up its efforts to protect health &amp; safety of communities in Upstate New York &amp; across the country.
I'm very pleased to be bringing Michael Hickey as my guest to the State of the Union. He is a true hero in what he has done to spur action in response to devastating effects that PFOA chemicals have had on our communities &amp; on families including his own. 	https://t.co/pDMkEMERNG
Took some time this afternoon to make valentines for veterans in our community. We'll drop them off next week—we want to have as many as possible!

I introduced my 2nd bill, the CLEAR Act, that will shed light on dark money in politics. Proud the standalone bill will be included in H.R. 1 legislation. It’s time to take power away from special interests &amp; put it back into hands of the people. More: https://t.co/GJp36DoF3E

Following reports EPA won't set limits on PFOA levels, I sent a letter today to EPA urging limits &amp; additional steps to address water contamination in Upstate NY. EPA should not turn its back on communities like Hoosick Falls &amp; Petersburgh. Read my letter: https://t.co/A47YM8QoJk https://t.co/uJbyLyqL7r
W/ 10 yr anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act this week, proud to join as cosponsor of Paycheck Fairness Act. Employees should be treated fairly &amp; employers need to be held accountable when they engage in wage discrimination. #EqualPay #FairPay https://t.co/oh3adWlOax
In light of emerging evidence on danger PFOA causes, it would be unconscionable for EPA to not limit levels of these chemicals in our communities. EPA must take water contamination seriously &amp; I will do everything in my power to step up efforts to address this growing crisis.
There's reports now that the EPA won't limit levels of PFOA in drinking water. I have seen personally the damaging effects of PFOA in Hoosick Falls &amp; Petersburgh, &amp; talked to families who lost loved ones from cancer caused by contaminated drinking water. https://t.co/A47YM8QoJk

We owe it to the federal employees, members of the Coast Guard, farmers, and others in our community who were impacted by this shutdown to make sure that we do not find ourselves here again.
From Day One, I’ve called for reopening the government and continuing negotiations. It’s what I reiterated in my recent letter with House Democrats, and I’m encouraged that Congress and the Administration are in agreement that we must reopen the government.
Today’s deal finally brings relief to the people of Upstate New York and our entire country who have been impacted by this irresponsible and reckless shutdown. I’m pleased that this agreement will come to the floor and I look forward to supporting it.
Today, I called on the Office of Personnel Management to ensure federal employees are not at risk for losing their dental or vision insurance. This is an absurd situation – folks already missing their paychecks shouldn’t have to deal with this. Read more: https://t.co/Yc0xKcpJwI

I reached out after hearing from a grocery store owner in our district who cannot currently process SNAP benefits because the EBT license had expired, and could not be renewed due to the government shutdown.
I wrote to the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture to immediately extend expired EBT licenses—which are used to process SNAP benefits—for the duration of the shutdown so that no American will go hungry. https://t.co/aVEvvcPWUw
I met federal workers who are missing a paycheck b/c of shutdown at a dinner yesterday that brought folks together &amp; provided free meal for workers. Wonderful to see how communities are supporting federal employees, but we shouldn't have to be in this situation in the 1st place. https://t.co/9lpVK4zoZS
It is plain wrong that they have to show up and work every day without getting paid. Getting to talk with them was yet another demonstration of the urgency of the need to reopen our government.
I met today with members of the Coast Guard in Saugerties who are showing up every day, without pay, because of the shutdown. Their work here is incredibly valuable -- not only search and rescue, but ice breaking on the Hudson River that's critical to our economy here. https://t.co/XQhT1cYamH
Amidst the gov't shutdown, we’ll have extended office hours again this weekend to hear from folks &amp; answer questions. Call us Sat., Sun., or Mon. between 10 AM &amp; 2 PM at 202-225-5614 &amp; we’ll be opening our Kingston office between 10 AM &amp; 2 PM on Mon., Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
Met w/ farmers from the Hudson Valley to hear about impact of the shutdown. From possible delays in getting visas approved or uncertainty on grant funding, the farming community here is deeply worried about how long this shutdown will last and how it’ll affect their bottom line. https://t.co/mbdwjdnQcC
Her memory will live on because she defined what true service means. My thoughts and prayers are with her children, husband, and the rest of her family and friends at this difficult time.
Shannon M. Kent devoted her life to protecting our country and defending democracy—this is a terrible tragedy and heartbreaking loss. She provides an example to all of us with her dedication and sacrifice for our country. https://t.co/GJSwMlwCjq
Amidst the government shutdown, I'm holding my first town hall Monday. The shutdown has created urgency around the need to host a town hall sooner rather than later to provide a forum to express your concerns in person and hear directly from me. Join us: https://t.co/pygcOA6bWn

I gave my first speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, honoring Major James M. Brophy from Staatsburg, who lost his life while serving our country. https://t.co/glN1awHluT
On these cmtes, I can advocate for key issues, from supporting our farmers to expanding rural broadband to improving our water infrastructure. I look forward to working w/ my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make advancements that will have a real impact in Upstate NY.
From Day One I’ve said I want to focus on the priorities of our district, and serving on the Agriculture Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee will give me the ability to do that every day in Congress. https://t.co/KBbwNYxBgu
Great to meet w/ @HANYScomm to discuss ways to support rural hospitals and make health care more affordable and accessible to all. These are critical issues for our district and I look forward to continuing to work in Congress on improving health care coverage for folks at home. https://t.co/WoNFDOjfik
Our district is home to over 4,000 federal workers. Many of these individuals and their families can't afford missing a paycheck, and they can't just put their lives on hold while this irresponsible, unnecessary shutdown continues. https://t.co/ivCY1tb6oY
Proud to join w/ members of the disability community to rally around importance of passing the Disability Integration Act. I’m glad to be an original cosponsor of this bipartisan bill that will expand the rights of people w/ disabilities so more can live independently. #DIAtoday https://t.co/JoaaHCZdvE
I'm joining @WNYC’s @BrianLehrer now to discuss the government shutdown and my priorities as a Congressman. Have questions for me? Tweet to @brianlehrer, or you can call the show to ask your question live at 212-433-9692. Tune in: https://t.co/54JOQVe8DL
"U.S. Rep Antonio Delgado unveiled his new district office at 256 Clinton Ave. on Sunday, Jan. 13, with a packed open house that featured a speech &amp; a meet-and-greet session with constituents. 'Constituent services go to the heart of this job,' he said." https://t.co/ukuC4SwdV6
As we write, "This rule ignores Congressional intent on abortion coverage, would create consumer confusion &amp; would be costly for both insurers &amp; consumers. By denying women comprehensive health coverage, it puts their health &amp; lives in danger." More: https://t.co/x9g6Y2vQS6
I joined Rep. Jan Schakowsky and over 170 members of Congress to voice our strong objection to a proposed rule from the Department of Health and Human Services that would deny women comprehensive health coverage and jeopardize abortion access, especially in our state.
We officially opened our first office today, in Kingston! Our offices are here to serve you, as a place to call or visit to voice your opinion on an issue, share your ideas, and have your questions answered. Hope to see you at our Kingston office soon: 256 Clinton Ave. #NY19 https://t.co/x69wAmfK5t
Humbled and honored to have the opportunity to serve as the Congressman for the 19th Congressional District. It was incredible to share this moment here at home in the community. https://t.co/nH2G8EQ2lB
We’re here at @HudsonHall1855 about to kickoff the swearing-in celebration. Tune in live at https://t.co/wS7PimAQWa.
With the government shutdown continuing, my office is here to do all we can to help folks, especially those impacted by the shutdown. So we're extending our hours, with our phone lines open this weekend from 10 AM - 2 PM. Call us at (202) 225-5614 with your questions or concerns.
We're getting ready for tomorrow's swearing-in ceremony in Hudson. If you're not able to join us in person, it'll be livestreamed at noon at https://t.co/wS7PimAQWa -- hope you'll tune in. #NY19
With veterans &amp; their families sacrificing so much for our rights &amp; freedoms, it’s our solemn obligation as a nation to ensure their health &amp; well-being. I am proud that the 1st bill I’m introducing as a Member of Congress will help veteran families. More: https://t.co/FmdwQF93hN
A lawsuit jeopardizing the protections set forth in the ACA could not be any further from what we ought to be doing when it comes to solving the health care crisis.		More: https://t.co/h0fxuoIkNN
We need to do much more to expand affordable and accessible health care to everyone, and no longer remain the lone developed country in the world without universal coverage.
If the lawsuit against the ACA succeeds, it could remove protections for pre-existing conditions and jeopardize health care coverage for people across the district.
I'm glad to join Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to make clear that we are here to stand up for the ACA in the face of attacks against it that could be devastating for the people of Upstate New York.

With federal employees in Upstate NY &amp; across the country missing their first paycheck tomorrow due to the government shutdown, I will be asking the House of Representatives Chief Administrative Officer to withhold my pay as long as the shutdown continues. Watch my message: https://t.co/BjyZtUcSpg
Our District Director Amanda sent along a sneak peek of our Kingston office ahead of Sunday’s opening. Check it out, and hope to see you there! Details here: https://t.co/Ut5uoO11Er https://t.co/pbMHrs93py
That's why I signed a letter led by Rep. DeLauro to the Department of Agriculture to get answers. Read more: https://t.co/gXEeb0qzrj
While I'm glad that the Department of Agriculture will at least continue benefits through next month, the agency must lay out plans for how it's processing applications, communicating with families in the program &amp; addressing lapse of funding if the government shutdown continues.
The irresponsible government shutdown is now putting at risk families' ability to put food on the table. From kids to seniors across the district, the SNAP program provides essential benefits.
Come join us Sunday for our Kingston office opening! I hope to meet many new folks, and that in my time in Congress, 19th district residents see our offices throughout the district as a resource -- we're here to help and to listen. Details &amp; RSVP: https://t.co/lfeDrnPxn7 #NY19
The shutdown is already having damaging effects in Upstate NY--I believe folks deserve transparency on how it's affecting local business owners applying for grants &amp; loans, farmers seeking relief to offset impact of Administration's trade policies &amp; others https://t.co/SCGZ7wYe8z
I signed on as one of the first backers of Rep. O’Halleran’s Government Shutdown Impact Report Act of 2019, that requires the Congressional Budget Office to submit daily reports to Congress on the cost and impact of a government shutdown.
Our Congressional office is up &amp; running! Took time today to join my team answering the phones. We’re here to help w/ federal services &amp; get input on what my priorities should be. Give us a call at 202-225-5614 &amp; we’ll be updating folks about upcoming office openings in-district. https://t.co/hqlz41Knxz
Great to sit down with folks today — including Tim Guinee from Stone Ridge — to discuss the importance of environmental protections, and how we can support green jobs and sustainable industry in Upstate New York. https://t.co/WstKsi5UhP
The shutdown continues to have damaging effects in Upstate NY, from small businesses to airports. Voting this week on additional proposals to end the shutdown, ones that previously got bipartisan support in the Senate. No reason for shutdown to continue. https://t.co/rnePbQxJNi
This historic bill will help strengthen everyday Americans’ power in our democracy and raise the bar for ethics in Washington.		https://t.co/kB3fQVAbzM #ForThePeople #NY19
Today I cosponsored #HR1, a historic government reform bill. Corporate power is commanding way too much attention in Washington; it is time that our government be responsive to the will of the people rather than the interests of a wealthy few and big corporations.
People across our district and the country have a right to clean drinking water, and transparency when it comes to what’s in their water. The water contamination in Hoosick Falls and Petersburgh is unacceptable, and I’m committed to addressing it. https://t.co/6hAEwCmoGT
One of the best moments this past week was getting the chance to read to my boys and niece on the floor of the House during the swearing in ceremony. Thrilled to see this image on the cover of the @timesunion. https://t.co/LLyNBrSQb2
The shutdown is completely irresponsible &amp; has real consequences here, standing in way of NTSB fulfilling its responsibilities. Its investigation into the limo crash must continue as quickly as possible—one of many, many reasons we need to reopen the gov’t https://t.co/WnAPBYfy4w
I’m committed to getting to work on behalf of our district. Right now, that means reopening the gov’t, opening district offices &amp; working across the aisle on key priorities like health care, rural broadband &amp; more. Honored to have the opportunity to do so. https://t.co/B0SLigTUPw
Just leaving the press conference on the historic government reform bill #HR1, and shared my thoughts on the importance of doing away with the imbalance of corporate power in our democracy. #ForThePeople https://t.co/kFzjh3ztQU
I couldn't be more proud to represent the people of New York's 19th Congressional District. Humbled to have this opportunity to serve and thankful to have my family with me today. #NY19 https://t.co/DdouJLTROt
Welcome to my new page! I'll have frequent updates here on what I'm doing in Congress as the Representative for New York's 19th Congressional District, and I hope you'll share your views as well.
