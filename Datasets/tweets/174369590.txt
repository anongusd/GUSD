@FrankLuntz @KDTrey5 Could watch that all day. Nice touch, nice stroke, nice release, totally concentrated on facing the basket and drilling the shot.
@thehill @TinaSmithMN, @Ilhan believes she can teach Americans because only she has experienced war. America went through 9-11, and we don't need her lessons. She needs to stand down from supporting this. Unfortunately, @BarackObama is just like her. Need to step back.
@thehill I disagree with @SenTinaSmith, who promotes cavalier abortion and slaughter of the innocent. So does @Ilhan blithely supporting those who  carry out acts of terrorism. So the West Virginia @gop got it right, not wrong. Smith associate @GovMarkDayton is responsible for her selectn
@washingtonpost Actually it IS science. I hope it gets to the kids effectively. Love, not hate, is what the kids need.
@DailySignal @USMC @BarackObama is a traitor to this country. He knew this, but to him, it hurts the nation so it's good. Our mission now is to avoid going back to this terrible time in American history.
@JillDLawrence @MrWalterShapiro Once again, Trump did the right thing and you are the #fakenews.
@omriceren @SebGorka This is not acceptable, and the poster with 9-11 is understandable and not wrong. She's like, well with 9-11 there were good people on both sides, but not Americans. She gives life to the @potus charge of "Americans" celebrating the attack on the nearby roofs. She needs to stop.
@DavidNakamura @JChengWSJ You shouldn't write this kind of crp David.
@thehill Here's the point. @TheDemocrats have laws to FORCE a female into the @USSenate unconstitutionally EXCLUDING males from participating so they can get the crazy, bigoted, conniving female--like @amyklobuchar or @TinaSmithMN or @Ilhan. FACT. @potus
@AOC Here's the thing. We were attacked. She was not. She's promoting the same thing. Stop.
@EgSophie @rolandsmartin @IlhanMN She needs reverse course or resign.
@secupp It's not indefensible.
@thehill @LatPoliticalAve Well that's true.
@PPact Hope you gag in your foul business @TinaSmithMN
Winter Grass https://t.co/AsHDBUPZ09
@RepEliotEngel @joshtpm He's a fool to keep her on the committee.
@CuomoPrimeTime Dug that he's related to @realDonaldTrump ?? Did I get it right?
@davidhogg111 They know doesn't believe America was ever all white. You nitwits.
@RepSwalwell #fakeap
@BennieGThompson The wonders of affirmative action.
@RepAngieCraig @Ilhan @MinnesotaDFL should condemn her conduct
@RepSlotkin So you are linking her conduct to Islam the?
@IlhanMN Go look in a mirror.
@pushkinforhouse @WVGOP @GovMarkDayton never knew.
@McFaul So koi killed him?
@jonfavs You like @HillaryClinton?
@EvanMcMullin @EvanMcMullin is situationally ignorant
@KamalaHarris Public schools are a travesty.
@KurtSchlichter Yeah, zen blah, blah @EWErickson
@laurenacooley @KurtSchlichter @POTUS @UMNews we are coming for YOU.
@selectedwisdom It was a joke, Mr. "@fbi guy". Further, to the extent it could be construed as serious, it would have been to release them back to the United States government, not to the public. IF Russia had them. @potus
@neeratanden @rolandsmartin It is not they but America whom you  ATTEMPT oppress. But we will kick your butt.
@AdamSerwer @rolandsmartin Blackface?
@postpolitics What this would require, @BetsyDeVosED @POTUS would be 1. Expand academic freedom protections to include students, instead of just faculty as some faculty like to claim; and 2. Put the protections directly in the Student Activities regulations including charters of student orgs.
@nytimes Was her middle name Sanger? #MargaretSangerGarner?
@OurRevolution @Atlanta4Bernie @ninaturner Looks like Hitler, @SenSanders. Just visually...
@BernieSanders The shortcoming here, Bernie is you have no plans for the border region itself. @realDonaldTrump does. I do. Develop the border region. Jobs. Security. Good neighbor relations.
@JoyAnnReid @realMikeLindell is a genius who has been blessed and really does believe America's greatness is a blessing from God that can be kept. While I'm at it, Louis (Chip) Combs gave me this book "And God created America" I'm reading and it's real good history.
@wis10 Hey @realMikeLindell you should start a mission to give every homeless person a MyPillow with a carrier. Kids' MyPillows. Maybe with a little backpack for carrying it, school supplies, etc.
@nytimes She's not even constitutionally elected. Someday even @nytimes will see the problem with this. But for now, they support these rigged elections.
@DavidMDrucker @realDonaldTrump You disagree with this, David? And you don't see the problem here? How did @Ilhan get there? Do you even know? I know. And @amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar helped campaign for her. Ask her now if that was the right thing to do.
@LizMair No it does not contradict Miller smh.
@WashTimes So it seems to me that a gag order on a book based on a court proceeding is highly questionable. Why would Stone have any lesser rights to publish his opinions than say the @nytimes
@hufco60 @KurtSchlichter @CPAC Outside is not black. But the entire inside is delineated by a strong yellow color which makes it look like sunlight, a kind of reversal of nature, and creation of a new nature inside the establishment, while we're not so sure about the outside streets. Which are calm.
@hufco60 @KurtSchlichter @CPAC It looks like it's in New York City but it says "Phillies".
@hufco60 @KurtSchlichter @CPAC What's so fascinating about this painting is the poverty, the scarcity and yet the unabashed Americanism. It reminds me of Steinbeck's description of the truck stop in Grapes of Wrath. There's a community that seems the purpose of the little restaurant in the neighborhood. Classy
@DiamondandSilk @SteveKingIA Whoa! So the black journalists like @jbouie @Yamiche @ApriIDRyan or politicians are actually just carrying water for the racist white liberals, like @GovMarkDayton @HillaryClinton @BillClinton etc. Rather than breaking down racism. Told what they can have by @TheDemocrats. abortn
@DiamondandSilk @SteveKingIA I agree that wikipedia does offer a viewpoint, and agree that literally no white believe that America was ever a "white nation." It is a collection, originally of European colonies, dominated by the British Empire that gained independence. No one should back the British v America
@DiamondandSilk @SteveKingIA In addition, @nytimes wants to attract attention. They know that if they can label this guy as a "racist" AND get action from weak individuals like @GOPLeader they can get clicks, more advertisers and compete with other crazies like @washingtonpost, @maddow, @cnn, etc.
@DiamondandSilk @SteveKingIA I'm watching this and I like it a lot. I'd add though, that the @nytimes and #fakenews "reporters" are actually confused. They can't talk with @SteveKingIA with any comprehension. THEY think that Western civilization is evil incarnate, even though they are a part of it.
@gtconway3d @JoeConason Same challenge to you as to @BillKristol. Name a lie by @potus.
@BillKristol @JoeConason Give me one example of a lie, @BillKristol. Go ahead. Should be simple, right? I'm waiting.
@notcapnamerica @IanSams So according to Iowa three instances of "child assault" which the government supposedly protects against are Bullying; Abduction; Sexual Abuse. So would she prosecute school bullies?
@notcapnamerica @IanSams Okay, what's a "child assault unit"?
@vets4bernie It appears @SenSanders is the MOST PREPARED @TheDemocrats prez candidate for #Election2020, ready to bust out and take over the primary. He will run into #genderquotas in every state whittling down male delegates to under 50%, but there are FOUR of them splintering women's vote.
@cvpayne @carolmswain "Da Boss" @aoc: "We have black staff." Props.
@FaceTheNation @KamalaHarris Unfortunately @SenKamalaHarris doesn't know the truth, so...
@thehill @TheHillOpinion Uh, I don't think @TheDemocrats pray...
@JWalkerII @ElieNYC I forget. Who DID frame Roger Rabbit?
@KurtSchlichter So....his name is mud?
@People4Bernie @BernieSanders Where's the snow?
Noted. @amyklobuchar when will you and @Ilhan be dropping out? https://t.co/RhzgKWoy7X
@diana_west_ @TheLastRefuge2 #RobertMueller and his little sidekick @amyklobuchar (and her evil little foreign agent sidekick @Ilhan) will go down in history as WORSE than #JoeMcCarthy. A disgrace to the U.S. Constitution.
@thehill And?
@thehill Now compare how @amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar treats her staff with how she treats @IlhanMN. She treats her like a rock star and campaigns for her, even announcing in the snow that "I think Ilhan Omar is with us here today". How crazy is Amy? Now Omars @DemSocialists @SenSanders
@politico Meanwhile @POTUS will #BuildTheWall
@chicagotribune That's right, he ordered it. So?
@thehill @aoc is telling @SpeakerPelosi she's the real speaker. @RepAOC is the real speaker, Pelosi's just a prop.
@KarlRove Can you believe @amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar was CAMPAIGNING for Omar, even on the day she announced in the snow? Klobuchar said "I think we have Ilhan Omar here today". Klobuchar was wrong, of course, Omar was not there but talk about CLUELESS!
@RashidaTlaib @iSheyman @IlhanMN How is this "racism"? The only reason she's there is because of her race, which she has in common with @keithellison who benefitted from a race quota in @MinnesotaDFL voting rules and cutting a deal with the women majority.
@NBCNews So, and this is a story....why?
@secupp @mschlapp Yeah, "the press". Lots of laughs.
@AnnCoulter Boring? I hear @realDonaldTrump will be at @CPAC this morning. Doesn't sound boring to me.
@Pontifex Well, @E_J_Piper @emilypiper think of those hundreds of Minnesota women whose #breastcancer treatment insurance is cancelled by @MNcounties before their treatment is finished and while they are still alive. Could you open a path for them? Do you think this is God's Will?
@WalshFreedom Trump is 100 times smarter than you Joe. People thought you were the rock musician is how you even got in this business.
@AaronBlake Hey Aaron you're from Minnesota, so why don't you write about why @amyklobuchar campaigned to put @Ilhan in @HouseFloor from CD5, the most populous district that @SenAmyKlobuchar herself came from and why it is a SHAMBLES. Write something meaningful.
@brianstelter See that little word "fake" in #fakenews Brian? It means people know you lie and make things up. Jefferson knew this about your "profession". You're actually ridiculous.
@scottwongDC Yes, clarifying for #fakenews idiots like you Scott. I said all along he holds KJU responsible.
@amyklobuchar "Clear truth"? Why  did @amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar actively campaign to put crazy @Ilhan in the @HouseFloor? I'll tell you why, because Amy and her loyal staffers were more interested in getting the CD5 @MinnesotaDFL vote without mindfulness. @nytimes @washingtonpost @NBCNews
@kathrynw5 So what? You promote your #fakenews for $$$.
@RepFueLee @pushkinforhouse @Ilhan doesn't belong there. This  is the  result of entitled delegates for Somalians, Muslims, blacks and women and a conniving governor, @GovMarkDayton. Essentially she, and a few others represent the destruction of the @MinnesotaDFL because of #waltermondale's quota system.
@RBReich @EatonSenator It's your thinking that's embarrassing Robert. Do you deny the problems in Europe? Should we forget Pearl Harbor? Why? Because you live in an ivory tower and get in pointless spats over nothing, just to amuse on @twitter?
@amyklobuchar @EatonSenator Now you're parroting WaPo which is one of the big reasons your brain doesn't work. Trump says the prison there is very brutal, for a lot of people. People shouldn't go there. He's not softening. Our POWs understand NK brutality.
@amyklobuchar @EatonSenator You are a very foolish woman, Amy. I think Trump needs to use all sources to determine the capabilities of NK. Your ALLY @MichaelJMorell was on national TV saying we couldn't know the locations of the nukes there. Now I see @gen_jackkeane e.g. has changed tune. You haven't.
@JoeNBC @RepThomasMassie is the Zen guy but
@soledadobrien @MeghanMcCain I agree w Meghan.
@amyklobuchar You're too dumb to be a senator.
@SallyQYates Your disloyalty to our constitution and way of life continues to shock me.
@psamsundar I have consistently remarked on this.
@HotlineJosh She's defending her foreign allegiance to Somalia and anti-American isn't.
@KamalaHarris Cultural disparities not racial. They as a group have a learning deficit because of not knowing Western civilization.
Minnesota grown Tulips. https://t.co/Q4dny4UhGw
Even Minnesota Robin is tough. https://t.co/ERIURgMs1m
@amyklobuchar what did you do about family separation when @BarackObama began it? https://t.co/jZ0R5rwDar
@thehill #NorthKorea You can talk the talk, but you must walk the walk.
@creynoldsnc Let your children live. Regain your sanity.
@GKButterfield Yeah, black kids who hate America congratulations. I see the art loud and clear.
@thehill Well, @HouseDemocrats voting independently is a very positive development and something I have said in the campaigns for Congress that I WOULD do. And yes, gun security requires a secure border absolutely. @POTUS
@seanhannity I think @aoc is about to be primaried.
@gtconway3d @JoeNBC What you need to perceive @Peggynoonannyc is that Cohen has been held captive, threatened, punished publicly and now is brought around for public humiliation. Do you really  accept this as anything but a North Korean type political brainwashing? It's inhumane. You?
@DavidMDrucker So what  is YOUR information, @joshrogin?
@wis10 But NK is incorrect. Sanctions that are loosened for no good reason are not sanctions. They need to come up with satisfactory denuclearization.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @ArthurSchwartz Again, this is on @GovMarkDayton and @keithellison. They think this is pretty cool. She was not elected, she was appointed by an endorsement after the state convention was all over and Ellison shifted from @HouseFloor leaving this opportunity to hurt the nation by Dayton.
... https://t.co/wvXpt3T1ey
@thehill @RepChrisStewart he's not saying NK isn't responsible. This is a complex relationship as an alternative to a cruise missile into their nuke sites. But @potus should press for finding the killers and putting them on trial, if NK does things like that. Why don't you ask for that?
@CillizzaCNN Sure, you protect their rights, @justinamash? What a joke. I'll bet you can't even list all their rights. And I know for sure you don't protect them.
@NRO @jackrcrowe @nro is #fakenews. Now they "defy" Trump. You're morons.
@thehill So? So you hate her, is that your  problem?
@chicagotribune I don't know how literate your Chicago readers are, but that is a rebuke of KJU. Can you comprehend that?
@dncpress If you ever watch news you would have seen that @potus is pulling together a panel of scientists to address this. So, again, you're simply WRONG.
@atrupar @kathrynw5 He has an absolute right I don't understand how people who CALL THEMSELVES journalists can't figure that out. #ysos?
@CillizzaCNN @JoeBiden forgot that he's from the party of awholes.
@alex_mallin So how is this inconsistent with @potus present position, ace? Did you NOTICE sanctions are left on? Do you ever mentiion it in your 'coverage'? Isn't that because of the MENACE to our world? #fakenews
@WajahatAli He didn't defend him. Maybe KJU is lying. Why don't you prove it?
@kazweida YOU'RE a prop, "Kaz". #fakenews
@davidgura @NBCNews What "lavish praise" are we talking about here? What crazy #fakenews says?
@washingtonpost Another TYPICAL #fakenews lie by WaPo trying to whip up hatred against the president. Trump did not say KJU is not responsible. In fact, @potus should ask him to do more, to identify the killers and bring them to justice.
@cnnbrk I know @cnn hates Trump and Trump voters but explain, CLEARLY, how that is a "rebuke" or whether you just want it to be.
@rolandsmartin Too bad there couldn't be an American as the first black president. Probably would have been a Republican, though, party of Lincoln, not of slavery (@theDemocrats)
@rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrump Livid yes. But not at @potus.
@rollcall Jen de ma?
@amyklobuchar High point of your life. And you made goofy faces like you just stabbed your staffer with your comb.
@JD_Tuccille It's all volunteer because the War ended. Now they only engage in conflicts where they can impress the National Guard members.
@postpolitics I demand that you stop your stupid posts.
@LizMair Says the clown brand.
@thehill @OfficialJLD, @alfranken is a dork. Another NEW YORK oih wow "celebxrity" from the TV that hustled uninformed Minnesota voters to help all the women's quotas in voting. You can have him back.
@amyklobuchar That's about as close as you're ever going to get. Fortunately for America.
@thehill You have some different content, but I think the two sides' depiction are pretty consistent. It's a matter of degree. I don't know what "some" sanctions they were talking about, but I think @realDonaldTrump is talking about EFFECTIVE sanctions, not comfortable sanctions.
@thehill Ok so I'm going to look at your story and see if you're telling the truth.
@USATODAY Yes, @Walmart keep the greeters. They really add a lot.
@Newsweek Binders full of idiots. @StaceyPlaskett
@julieroginsky @JamesPindell Yeah me to we never had hamburgers in Minnesota until McDonald's. Well, there was Henry's Hamburgers. I had always thought they were ham sandwiches.
@TXFeministTrust @maziehirono Then why not let them live?
@T_Horner Again no one excuses him
@RepBarbaraLee It's not outrageous
@RepBarbaraLee No not especially people of color.
@T_Horner I was born in Alamagordo, N.Mex. near White Sands.
@T_Horner He doesn't believe KJU knew about it. So the Vietnamese POW camps were the same way, Korea, Japan, that's what POW is like. The fact is many NK's still hate America like the enemy. Read @JChengWSJ he reports them all the time. Would I change my mind given evidence, yes.
@jonathanchait @SNienow @GovMarkDayton selected her.
@BullyCreative I think you have a thing called race pride.
@SenBlumenthal Don't give me that crap. The intel community decided to oppose OUR PRESIDENT who we voted for, you twit.
@PattyMurray Oh and who's little miss commando to make that determination? Not YOU. LOL.
@nytimes I don't think Trump said KJU was not responsible.
@T_Horner He didn't say that, AGAIN, Tom. He said he accepted that he didn't know. You twist everything. So "intel"? Now they say they pretty much know the nuke locations. They had said (@MichaelJMorell) they didn't know. Trump needed to judge whether they could hit U.S. He's got smarts.
@KamalaHarris Yeah, right. "Marriages".
@MarkWarner He's the president.
@TinaSmithMN We always knew what your "vote" would be you twit.
@SenTedCruz They have to take it. They have no right.
@NJ_Politics Uh, Russia?
@NewsHour @junghpak1 @BrookingsInst @JudyWoodruff Not true. Each felt they were offering something to the other and so they thought they might get a deal and it's necessary to try. However, objectively NK could not offer a starting point for the deal and @potus recognized this.
@WalshFreedom There were concessions.
@maziehirono Why do you hate children?
@AdamSchiff Where do you show it is not a national emergency, @RepAdamSchiff and WHERE is your authority to make that decision? Thank you  very much.
@NewsHour See goofball @newshour you spend so much time bashing Trump you  don't even READ your own headlines. But you want taxpayer dollars. @davidrobertgrov
@NewsHour This statement is that what they are doing RIGHT NOW, @newshour, it says they won'ty fire missiles and CONTINUE their development. Can your writers see the DIFFERENCE with denuclearization? Do you READ this stuff? Clarify please.
@NewsHour So here's what you have: "Ri said the North was also ready to offer in writing a permanent halt of the country’s nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests." @davidrobertgrov This is very different, unrelated to your claim.
@NewsHour I don't see where you claim he disputes Trump. I see he says something totally unrelated. Please be a professional and explain what you mean instead of the "headline".
@CBSNews The @SenSchumer voters.
@Newsweek But Mexican border hugging queen @SpeakerPelosi is really in charge because she's a MASTER strategist.
@NewsHour I don't say where you claim he disputes Trump. I see he says something totally unrelated. Please be a professional and explain what you mean instead of the "headline".
RT @CNNPolitics: Sen. Lindsey Graham warns that the US will end the North Korea nuclear threat "one way or the other" https://t.co/ECFnuYHU…
This ignorant woman @GovMarkDayton https://t.co/1HelZI5j6f
@abbydphillip @SunlenSerfaty A lot. Of people hate him but not because of his race. Too bad you couldn't elect an American for 1st black.
@Lawrence @woodhouseb Not a racist.
@nprpolitics Sorry @TheDemocrats will kill it like a live baby.
@JoaquinCastrotx @SenAlexander Actually why should @POTUS need to convince YOU it's an emergency Lamar? I agree he might consider the $5b you say is there for now.
@ZerlinaMaxwell You're racist to label her a prop.
@RWPUSA @JenTromans @NBCNews He has a right to question credibility of witness @RWPUSA
@RashidaTlaib @OversightDems What I'm hearing from you is treason.
@jemelehill Who's race baiting? You.
@joelpollak @LamarAlexander @BarackObama Well he says there is $5b to build #thewall in current budget year, is that it? I'm sure @potus is looking at that.
@dncpress 2.4% is better than economists predicted. You have failed MINDS. Terrible thing to waste.
@DalTexDave @atrupar @DWStweets @amyklobuchar @HillaryClinton She was set up by @BarackObama race hustler.
@KatiePhang Hard to believe she thinks she's making "legal" arguments.
@RepThomasMassie @LizMair Okay fine, so do you have a Republic with no border? Or with a border?
@mattmfm @rolandsmartin So people actually pay you for this junk?
So this is a valuable video. KJU wants to move forward with sanctions relief based on words. @POTUS does not, but wants to move forward. @RepCummings and his little gang played an outsized role in attacking American interests. https://t.co/RGVourdDjs
@DrKevinGray @JChengWSJ I'll definitely listen to @potus version. Whenever it's available over the deadly #fakenews noise.
@DrKevinGray @JChengWSJ Well of course traitors like @RepCummings did their damnedest to ensure the president would be given NO support by #fakenews and that Americans would be cut off from information. To YOU Elijah, this is your destiny. You twit.
@rollcall What kind of chump are you @DWStweets?
@BoDietl @seanhannity @POTUS Did he apply? Or did he get a code in his mind that he should not apply?
@USATODAY The methodology for Minneapolis St Paul is skewed and false. Calls into question your entire survey.
@jemelehill Where do they get it?
@Ilhan This woman is an idiot since most wars were fought with guns.
@JChengWSJ It's unacceptable.
@LifeNewsHQ @TinaSmithMN This ugly person is my 2020 primary opponent. No one forces anyone to be a doctor.
@nytpolitics @RepCummings is despicable. That's yours destiny, Elijah.
@thehill So in other words the accusation is Trump deliberately paid too much for insurance. I'm wondering whether Cohen was actually a lawyer at all.
@allinwithchris @RashidaTlaib Actually Rashida YOU'RE a racist to call her a prop. But since you are incapable of thought you might not have figured that out yet.
@JoyAnnReid You're establishing yourself as a liar. Oh, but I guess I already knew that. "Physical parading"?
@allinwithchris @AOC So this guy is an attorney? I don't think his disbarment in one state lets him off the hook for unethical actions against his former client.
@scottwongDC @RashidaTlaib @RepMarkMeadows It was not racist. And what makes you the arbiter to decide what's 'racist' and what's not?  What is your qualification?
Beginning of the end of @SpeakerPelosi as speaker. She's an unprincipled and overly ambitious coward. https://t.co/QeQePO3zAW
@nytimes Who's responsible for that fear is YOU, #fakenews mob.
@thehill So in point of fact, isn't it true sir, that you were EXTREMELY PROUD to be personal attorney to @POTUS? And you're now telling the world that was because you are a fool, is that right? When are you going to start making sense? That you were "blind" b/c @LannyDavis said so?
@benshapiro @guypbenson This is the @SpeakerPelosi #CrazyCongress. "@ilhan" the product of a lunatic @GovMarkDayton who bought his way into the statehouse. And now is destroying Minnesota, I'm sure he's SO proud of his little "teacher" mission.
@StarChamberMaid @KurtSchlichter Obviously no one expects to win. I know he didn't want a Russian tower instead. Also he told Amash or someone that he never got questions or orders but only codes. I think for whatever reason Michael was deluded for a LONG time.
@NewsHour @RepMarkMeadows @HUDgov I just think #MichaelCohen has no credibility, it's disgraceful for @TheDemocrats and intel threats like #RoberMueller to use him like this, AND to racebait, and I'll continue to pray for Michael, if he's born again, that he will TRULY turn to Jesus and seek answers.
@jeneps So?
So @amyklobuchar was thrilled to bring THIS, this frivolous  attack, to Congress and support it as far as her campaign for prez. I SEE how she "convicted" #KirbyPuckett and why she got out of that job and cakewalk with #genderquotas into #fakesenator from Minnesota. https://t.co/RSDqwRjsj4
Well ok @CillizzaCNN what this shows is that Trump was a target of a lot of rumor attacks and that for whatever reason #MichaelCohen got involved in dealing with these people. Then anti-American #RobertMueller got involved on behalf of his @cia rogue buddies and here we are. https://t.co/OBISOgUmKV
@nytimes @ktbenner So no questions, no orders, just code. This is what @amyklobuchar's got.
@CBSNews He's got a big ego.
@FaceTheNation So he's real emotional because of what the  dog @HillaryClinton people are doing to him. He's suffering. I'll NEVER support any @TheDemocrats or #fakenews who are doing this to the country. These enemies of the Republic need to stand down.
@kathrynw5 Oh. NOW it's "with a lawsuit". Clarification from #fakenews
@Philip_Elliott And you  think this is funny. #fakenews.
@ClaraJeffery @chrislhayes So you're a racist then. You deal in generalizations. Unprofessional.
@JakeSherman @politico Which feds?
@mikememoli @HotlineJosh @ByronYork I'm concluding journalists are just not that bright. This whole thing is a farce, but I guess you haven't figured that out.
@creynoldsnc You have @HillaryClinton friend and attorney @LannyDavis writing a script after #RobertMueller unlawfully invades the relationship of a lawyer. You people are disgraceful thugs and will have to face history.
@chrislhayes So he is a professional blackmailer then?
@nytimes Reimbursed? So was #MichaelCohen paid to blackmail his client?
@mikiebarb I'm going to repeat for the ignorant. He's not on trial. I could discuss your intelligence but it's @twitter.
@atrupar @DWStweets This is what it's all about @amyklobuchar you can't admit you LOST because of the terrible @HillaryClinton candidate. And you're even worse.
@eorden @maggieNYT So #MichaelCohen admits under oath he lied to his wife. Okay. @amyklobuchar?
@MaxBoot @brianstelter Nothing will exonerate your #FakeNews
@JakeSherman He's not on trial.
@brianstelter So Cohen is a cellphone now ?
@brianstelter Never been to Prague g hmmm
@jemelehill Who is this out of order moron?
@RepDonBeyer You're not interested in truth.
@selectedwisdom Nothing.
@JakeSherman D o		So it's an illegal seizure.
@DavidCornDC The "didn't doesn't have knowledge of this it's hearsay.
@amyklobuchar Well so but he's a known liar and self professed fool so what does that make you?
@AaronBlake You have no explanation.
@amyklobuchar Even if true it's not a big deal you're making personal attack.
@amyklobuchar It's not unconstitutional and you better be ready to make a case not just join a big gang of politicians.
@nytpolitics And Trump had a right to do that and if #MichaelCohen thought it was unlawful he should not have done it. @TheDemocrats are despicable, including #RobertMueller, for doing this to Cohen. A moment of #shame for our nation.
@davidfrum He doesn't say racist things in public. You are a Canadian race-baiter and I don't know who reads your stuff. I looked at the magazine in high school because I was a big reader. But you're worthless and fail to establish any link between the United States and Canada. Sad to say.
@MSNBC @mitchellreports Well, half-right better than I expected from #MichaelCohen
@AaronBlake #Fakenews like yourself Aaron always tell everyone all the news has already been covered. I would never read or listen to you.
@alexi @rolandsmartin It's not absurd at all. Slavery is ended, and if a black woman is working for him, she must not think he's a racist, because she could change jobs and would if he actually were a racist. Seems like a valid argument to me.
@mega2e @mikiebarb Actually that was a soap opera. Have you ever acted, Megan?
@thehill Looks like the match is on.
@JudyWoodruff @NewsHour Maybe Michael is lying about all this. He seems very motivated to do so.
@JudyWoodruff @NewsHour So he personally signs his checks alright.
@JudyWoodruff @NewsHour Uh, where does Cohen establish the affair? Or do pro journalists just repeat that stuff? Propaganda, Judy?
@KatyTurNBC @kasie No it wouldn't mean that. Notice that little word IF. Moron.
@USATODAY And that's a yes or no question.
@RepChrisCollins Oh, right, your state socialist propaganda network @MPRnews
So #MichaelCohen created a fake @Twitter account, that is what he is admitting to before these crazies in #CrazyCongress? https://t.co/tuA82S8gqX
@peterwallsten @PhilipRucker @jdawsey1 I'm afraid I can't comment more directly on your intelligence on @Twitter. Yeah, top-level "pro".
@peterwallsten @PhilipRucker @jdawsey1 Asian people are more civilized than you are. When they hold a meeting about war and peace they don't want your dumb ass in the building, dishonoring and disrespecting them. It's not retaliation. You wanted to get a big crowd for your performance.
@AaronBlake Yes, Aaron boy you hope to run your little Aarons for personal destruction against the president. And your friends like you and pay you. So impressed.
@michaelsderby Of COURSE it's all an issue for fed policy. So are the state fiscal situations. And yes, we do need to reverse the growth of the federal debt and deficit as I have said since first running in 2010.
@realDonaldTrump @AaronBlake Right, Aaron, all the little secrets which might have contradicted @BarackObama claims about his shady past. But we're talking about REALLY shady with Obama, a true enemy of the United States. Where are those transcripts btw "pro journalist"?
@USATODAY Let's see, "directed to threaten" schools not to release private information, hmmmm... looks serious. Is this a joke?
@bradheath @USATODAY Uh, you can't plead guilty to "crimes" on behalf of another person. Of course we know @TheDemocrats want to smear our president, that's what @amyklobuchar wants to do why  I detest her. A lot. Serious losers and haters is all they are. They will all be voted out.
@thehill My question to you #MichaelCohen is what have you been promised, and by whom, if you testify against Trump with all these "accusations". If you  wanted to do it, who did you ask?
@RBPundit @KurtSchlichter See in my case @UMNews wrote a letter to the @usedgov (then DHEW) claiming I had left school more than nine months before and refused to pay my student loans. They then froze my transcripts so I could not transfer to another school. The University of Minnesota commits crimes.
@CillizzaCNN It's obviously true of a lot of black people. It's also obviously true of a lot of non-black people. Chris, for instance.
@jpaceDC @JonLemire Yeah, what were the "questions" the world so urgently needed to hear about? Probably you were acting like infantile brats talking about "Michael Cohen"?
@PhilipRucker @JonLemire @jdawsey1 I'm only going to GUESS here, Philip, but I'm guessing they shouted questions about #MichaelCohen, CORRECT? Did I get it right? The world teeters on the edge, but YOU and your idiot friends want the whole planet to hear about your little hard-on for Michael. Did I guess it?
@PhilipRucker @JonLemire @jeffmason1 Maybe they're too stupid to cover this story. What were the "questions" you say they asked?
See @amyklobuchar this is also what I was doing. Because I was running for president myself so of course all this was of interest to me, as was Trump's well-funded and intelligent success. Thank you to Dick Tracy for figuring this out. https://t.co/8TRvhFtTQx
@RealSaavedra @Ilhan @mattgaetz has a perfect right  @SpeakerPelosi notwithstanding to call into question the credibility of #MichaelCohen as a witness. He is pointing out how Cohen lies to the public about his marriage. His is not a federal crime, just dishonesty, so he cant't be believed.
@SpeakerPelosi I know #fakenews is incredibly lazy and surprisingly naive but you're supposed to attack Nancy Pelosi for this incredible, fascistic little overreach to silence elected officials as a body on #socialmedia. @twitter, @facebook, etc.
@SpeakerPelosi So here is where Nancy uses the "popular vote" authority of safe-seat majorities to right herd on every elected member of Congress on #SocialMedia as if Herr Nancy can click her heels and everybody has to shut up on @twitter.
@smontemayor @toreyvanoot Just for a little translation, many Republicans feel that Adolf Hitler was a SOCIALIST. Left-wing, not right-wing. He backed centrist state policies like @AOC and @BernieSanders and lately @amyklobuchar. Then when they seize power surprise, they can't really do those things.
@brianstelter @HotlineJosh @Acosta Everybody already wrote days ago that this was your little #fakenews schedule. You're like kids....hilarious
@PhilipRucker Right, "advisers". Crawl back in your hole, Phil. Is it Groundhog's Day or something?
@PhilipRucker @John_Hudson To anyone besides a smarmy little gossiper like Phil it would be self-evident that we need others like China and Russia to agree not to entice NK to develop weapons in the war to taunt the U.S. That's because you're an idiot, Mr. Rucker. You pretend to have these obvious "discov"
@PhilipRucker @brhodes Phil you already look ridiculous. Only idiots consume your tripe. Oh right and Ben, foreign "expert". A couple of loons. Not in the internet age, you look naked and foolish.
@politico Ah yes, like @wikileaks worked for @realDonaldTrump. R-I-I-GHT.
@Newsweek Oh, yeah, I do that too. Just try getting my grades from the @UMNews. The administration has them locked up.
@usatodayDC @USATODAY Many very stupid people, since @TheDemocrats and #RobertMueller put him in prison so they can bring him around in chains anytime it helps the @amyklobuchar campaign. America sees their ugliness. This is not America you thugs.
@bpolitics Yeah, so did I. I think @wikileaks was indicating that. It would have been remiss of @HillaryClinton opponent not to be aware that her little subterfuge and deadly irresponsibility and general nastiness would become known despite her deceptions.
@NBCNews @Morning_Joe Interestingly, I was discussing that very thing at the same time or BEFORE. Because it was publicly known. It was a dynamic that the liar @HillaryClinton was hiding things while Chris Stevens etc were murdered and @BillClinton said it wasn't Hillary's fault. When wd it come out?
@Morning_Joe I'm so impressed. How can, apparently, a single person come up with such an incredible list of LOSERS! So you have viewers who actually listen to these people? Or are you just trying to be obnoxious as your life's work, @JoeNBC? Did you love your mother as a child?
@TeaPartyNevada @gatewaypundit @TheDemocrats like @amyklobuchar are DISLOYAL to their country, but LOVE their own "oppressed" gender so they would gladly cause war to get a new comb to eat a salad at the airport and feel SO IMPORTANT and rub shoulders with #WalterMondale high school crush. #HairSaladAmy
@AaronBlake What it suggests to me is that @mattgaetz thinks #MichaelCohen doesn't tell the truth to anyone, even his wife, apparently when he is unfaithful. You misconstrued it, as you do every time, Aaron, into threatening to imprison Cohen. You KNOW @TheDemocrats already did this.
@Newsweek Oh NOW it's just @federalreserve before she was allegedly talking about "economic policy" as if @JanetYellenBlog was the be all and end all of economics in the United States. Congratulations of raising your IQ a point, #fakenews
@ron_fournier My best defense is you are support members of a national party who lost, of @amyklobuchar who are now capturing a man with #RobertMueller breaking into a lawyer's office to get unrelated papers, putting him in prisoning and now leading him around Congress mocking the winner.SHAME
@ron_fournier But they are, and the foolishest was @AmbassadorRice announcing we'll just let to have them shoot nukes all over because Russia.
@ron_fournier You hate Trump. This is another country. Maybe they don't like #fakenews making a joke out of war.
@LizMair There's nothing unconstitutional about it, as #hairsaladAmy @amyklobuchar insists. It's her dishonesty that is the issue and her LOVE for #OpenBorders extremism.
Rhodes Scholar Rachel @maddow admits to material misrepresentation in order to get @potus. https://t.co/KW6LNN3AHX
@hookjan @scottwongDC Better Damocles of the Delaware.
@SethAbramson @rolandsmartin You're wrong. He's DISCREDITING the witness. Stop lyin' ALL the time.
@RawStory @rolandsmartin Lunatic.
@joelpollak @ChrisCuomo @CuomoPrimeTime @CNN @brianstelter @CNNPR @BreitbartNews Sorry I don't watch @cnn
@RichardHaass @kathrynw5 @realDonaldTrump I disagree with you Richard. The weapons are a lead weight around his neck. Do you HONESTLY believe that is helping him? Have you heard of the Korean War at all? You imagine he has and wants total control over a desperate economy. Total economic control. Prove it.
@RawStory @rolandsmartin @MarkWarner @CNN @warner @jamesgagliano @MarkWarner is trying to illegally seize power in the country. I'm not surprised there could be threats. It's the wrong thing to do. Another @cnn guy just said what @warner said is "bloodsport" @JamesAGagliano
@JamesAGagliano @HotlineJosh I'll argue that he's attacking his credibility. It's your BUDDIES the "bloodsport" @TheDemocrats who have ensured he will go to prison and are now sadistically leading him around the capitol to taunt @potus, as he defuses a nuclear war by the  way.
@thehill I would interpret @mattgaetz remarks as rejecting the honesty and integrity of the witness. The prison is not a threat, the @HouseDemocrats and @SenateDems have made SURE that he will be imprisoned and led around through the halls of Congress to be used as a prop to get @potus
@DavidAFrench @HotlineJosh No, David, what's unconscionable is @TheDemocrats destroying life after life like little @amyklobuchar Stalinists to punish the winning @POTUS. They are a disgrace and will be identified as such in the history books.
Copycat crime? https://t.co/UWWJeVIqJi
@allinwithchris What a lunatic.
@theblaze What's so bizarre about this is that it's #RobertMueller and his hate squad who are destroying #MichaelCohen's life and putting him in prison. And using him to try to smear @potus. This is exactly the kind of behavior I would expect from @amyklobuchar. What THUGS.
@allinwithchris Oh you POOR THING #AlvaJohnson! I just saw @JoeBiden today walk out on a stage and kiss a woman for introducing him.
@MatthewDalyWDC @khennessey @KnickmeyerEllen @mbieseck I don't see her being "shoved".
@DailySignal He was secretly baptized a Christian. @potus
@THESAFEMONEY @ddale8 @TheRickWilson @POTUS Sorry to say both @realDonaldTrump and I are a lot  smarter than you are.
@rollcall @potus is doing the right thing. @SpeakerPelosi is HARDLY any kind of patriot. And she's nuts saying this isn't about the border, and that she's equal to the president under the Constitution.
@johnrobertsFox @rolandsmartin @WhiteHouse Well, KJU was practically QUOTING you before he met @realDonaldTrump that he was a madman. YOU wrote it. You lied. And there's a certain logic to removing #FAKENEWS like you  from an important meeting. Where you persist in thinking you're the star.
Tell @RepAdamSchiff his star witness will be a little late to the Committee hearing. He got stuck... https://t.co/cNx52oRrax
@mviser So you wanted to knock over statues in the South, @JoeBiden? Well I'm a good people on the other side.
@thehill Uh, dummy @RepJeffries...Hakeem we already MADE a decision and YOU lost.
@mlcalderone @feliciasonmez #fakenews.
@ChrisMurphyCT You're really dumb Chris. Yes this is gun security duh.
Killers https://t.co/DFBv0I6Afx
@TeamPelosi You're crazy.
@TheDemocrats You're a liar.
@SpeakerPelosi Since you asked you're a corrupt traitor.
@amyklobuchar First of all, Amy, you're not a scientist, so forget that. Secondly, what science do you say is clear? We need more science.
@bpolitics Haven't read the opinion but have a strong feeling he should  appeal this. Even self-serving #HairSaladAmy seekers after presidency could see this is a direct threat to our Republic, just like the "popular vote" laws where political elites in Colorado GIVE AWAY their voters' wish
@thehill #NASTY only gets elected by manipulating #genderquotas and #gendercaps that exclude men from making the decision while attracting women who like that sort of thing. Then votes to kill LIVE babies. A real troll @amyklobuchar my opponent.
@maggieNYT But you don't know what she said Maggie because you don't know economic policy. You can't even TRANSLATE what @JanetYellenBlog was attempting to say.
@NBCNews @kathrynw5 So I'm wondering if @JanetYellenBlog has any idea what her job was supposed to have been. She's saying she believes that @federalreserve controls the economy with monetary policy? Is that what she's saying? Or does she lord it over fiscal policy as well? Or don't you get the qust
@johnrobertsFox @chrislhayes @EmanuelMacaron Just focus on the story and not on yourselves. I don't want to hear what you think about Trump. Just try to report whether we can back  away from the brink and end the Korean War and move on to human rights. Okay?
@theobserver It's not child abuse. They don't hurt the kids, in fact they give them self-confidence and self-esteem ('you can do it'). Similar to a sports program. Looks well supervised.
@allinwithchris @rolandsmartin That's because of the monopoly position @BarackObama put them in with his bail-out.
@W7VOA @JChengWSJ @POTUS The ao dais have arrived.
@SenAmyKlobuchar #HairSaladAmy is jealous... https://t.co/be4nljRr79
@THESAFEMONEY @ddale8 @TheRickWilson I saw it. I agree with @potus. We need a contract, a tariff schedule that will provide guidance, principles to our trade relations. Something that will have steady and lasting impact on a huge trade relationship. That's not an #MOU. Memorandum...
@soledadobrien @rolandsmartin Yeah, yeah, sure.
@karentravers @ThisWeekABC @JordynPhelps Nobody likes #fakenews

@THESAFEMONEY @ddale8 @TheRickWilson Right, legal terms don't mean anything. Legally illiterate
No one cares what the stupid @TheDemocrats have to say  about this. We already heard all that from @AmbassadorRice, a serious loser. https://t.co/QicCUocFpV
@PeterGanley Yes @TulsiGabbard but you're talking about that idiot @BarackObama. That fool is not involved in this. We need to focus on what decisions are going to be made regarding the future of East Asia. This is not Hawaii.
@NBCNews @mitchellreports #fakenews
@Taniel @ElectProject "Very likely"? Well, then they might be registered twice, probably are.
@theblaze That was a dumb remark @AOC you're not the boss. Duh..
@politico It is the direct result of @BarackObama, @MinnesotaDFL @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN
@thehill No, @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN this IS about the border. You said you supported defending our border, but then when @realDonaldTrump tries to do it you sabotage our national security. Why?Because @SenSchumer told you to do it?
@brithume Seriously Brit? @andyobryan? Denial of medical attention required to survive is not murder? So if the government were to willingly deny #breastcancer medical treatment to women in a government program it would not be murder? https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A I think it would be.
@MinnesotaDFL like @amyklobuchar and @TinaSmithMN are in disarray. https://t.co/pY4im0HXwA
@amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN are you listening? Do you REALLY think if a human life emerges from medical treatment it should not be preserved? @MinnesotaDFL https://t.co/kuZUFC0hvj
@doug_wardlow Doug, have you ever considered supporting an interpretation of the Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act that would give patients in #breastcancer treatment the entitlement to complete their cancer treatment before losing their coverage? https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A
@TinaSmithMN @SenTinaSmith claims #Minnesota and @E_J_Piper "don't tell oncologists how to treat their patients." Blatantly FALSE. @MNCourts 18-1380 SHOWS @RamseyCounty unlawfully cancelling #MABC cancer treatment coverage of hundreds of Minnesota women. https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A @MayoClinic
@annie_tibeau I condemn it #ElectoralCollege. Are you high?
@MinnesotaDFL @DNC @mngop must protest this further usurpation of power of voters under #USConstitution by voiding the vote of #Colorado voters and replacing it with national popular vote total determined by states like #NewYork, #California, #Texas. I oppose this, unconstitutnl https://t.co/XttnQimWd0
@JackPosobiec So @amyklobuchar friends @BuzzFeedNews falsely claimed @realDonaldTrump lawyer #MichaelCohen had a Russian wife? Any comment @SenAmyKlobuchar?
@PoliticalShort So @TinaSmithMN DID YOU VOTE @SenTinaSmith to KILL 3 Minnesota babies who survived #LiveAbortion? Answer, please.
So @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN @StarTribune @PioneerPress @PB_News @sctimes @MinnesotaDFL can you verify that @MinnesotaDHS reported 3 babies surviving botched live abortions in Minnesota in 2018? And that you  won't protect these infants in @USSenate https://t.co/9QYZ5BLxMm
@MinnesotaDFL @TomPerez @SenSanders you can't tell the difference @amyklobuchar between #FidelCastro, #maduro and a democratic leader @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/xAL2jaE06x
@sfpelosi @SpeakerPelosi daughter @sfpelosi praising #Maduro for his "sensible" treatment of @jorgeramosnews after @realDonaldTrump stands America behind freedom and human rights in Venezuela. Your type of American, @amyklobuchar. @MinnesotaDFL @TinaSmithMN
@nytimes No, it was cellphone video of young men feasting at back of garbage truck.
@evagolinger We're Americans. We have our elections. It's not show time for tin pot "journalists" like @jorgeramosnews to interrupt and attack and interfere with our democracy like third-worlders like @BarackObama do in banana republics. Probably you'll get people Venezuela hurt by dictators.
@TUSK81 Here's a tough question for you, dude. So your favorites @amyklobuchar @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi refused to negotiate even for the #daca and #tps people to simply build the #BorderWall they claimed they always supported. @realDonaldTrump was willing. And YOU? Tell me your dream
@scottwongDC He's wrong.
@BuckSexton How did @amyklobuchar vote? How did @TinaSmithMN vote?
@soledadobrien @rolandsmartin It's not a lie.
@GuthrieGF Find it in the  Bible.
@thehill So, abort all the children alright...
@TPNN_ThePoint Tell #Prince
@Newsweek I feel @SenSanders @amyklobuchar could team up to clean out the Washington bureaucracy. And get a good supply of drinking water to boot. Boot the bureaucrats for a bottle of water.
@politico News flash for @JanetYellenBlog! @federalreserve is not in charge of macroeconomics. #fakenews
@SenatorShaheen Even after the baby is born ALIVE? @TinaSmithMN
@kairyssdal @maddow Let's be clear: @JanetYellenBlog is saying she has a better grasp of macroeconomic fiscal policy than @realDonaldTrump? By all means fire away, Janet, let's hear it. Love to hear your ideas.
@TheUndefeated @rolandsmartin Genesis 3:18-19 "18Both thorns and thistles it will yield you, and you will eat the plants of the field. 19By the sweat of your brow you will eat your bread," All mankind is bound to the soil. The sugar cane and tobacco drug farmers became greedy, though.
@COSecofState He didn't represent Mississippi.
@LisaDNews @NewsHour @SpeakerPelosi Better get @RalphNortham because the #NationalEmergency is alive and kicking.
@ThisWeekABC Only thing funnier than @alfranken talking about "patriotism" is @SpeakerPelosi and @RepMaxineWaters talking about "patriotism".
@politico It's not "a political goal".
@WashTimes So @JanetYellenBlog let's just focus on @POTUS fiscal economic policy. Are you criticizing the tax cut are you saying it will not have the effects desired by @realDonaldTrump? Or are you discussing monetary policy?
@maziehirono @creynoldsnc Well let me ask you this, Senator. A woman in #breastcancer treatment in consultation with their doctor, determining the best course of their care to survive cancer, should @AGEllison respect that and allow them to finish their cancer treatment? Or cancel? https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A
@TinaSmithMN @amyklobuchar you girls deny that this poll is correct? https://t.co/inIgUMBslC
@thehill What goals did you have @JanetYellenBlog? Respond to changes in the American and world economies? Fairly broad.

@AGEllison wants control of your health care through #MedicareForAll. But wants to cut #breastcancer treatment coverage for HUNDREDS of women in Minnesota alone. Increased risk of cancer death is unacceptable and undermines govt-run HC. @HHSGov @VP @GovTimWalz @mndailynews https://t.co/tfz0AwEq5N

@PattyMurray @HouseDemocrats It's not fake
@RepJeffries You're destroying our nation.
@TheAtlantic It's a movie.
@WalshFreedom Talk about landgrant universities.
@MPRnews The judge is wrong.
@amyklobuchar You block men from voting to help your chances. Will you admit that @senamyklobuchar?
@WalshFreedom I have a clue. Look at the @MinnesotaDFL @DNC rules. They have caps for everything. Caps for you as a 1. Male (50%) 2. White (down to about 40% of vote). 3. Straight (to 35%). 4. Christian (32%). Muslim Somalians have voter quota. Complicated society, restricted individual rights
@washingtonpost #SpikeLee dresses up like Cab Calloway and pretends he's doing #Prince.
@SenSchumer I'm beginning to realize the fundamental problem that New Yorkers, like #SpikeLee and Chuck here don't know anything about film.
@rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrump can criticize whomever he pleases. I immediately called #SpikeLee racist (read my @Twitter feed) so we're on same page on that. @potus is a genius. You are not, Roland, just sayin'. You still hung over?
@JoeNBC @realDonaldTrump is right on here. Also, Mr. @POTUS check out who #DonShirley actually is: https://t.co/YOhZv8AhdH AMAZING jazz and classical musician who toured Deep South and was loved.
@DalaiLama Actually "merely praying" is a misconception. Just like your consciousness shapes your life and actions, prayer, invoking the power of #JesusChrist also empowers actions. #StevenSeagal told me that Christianity just doesn't do it for him. But Christ toppled the Roman Empire.
@washingtonpost No. The biggest obstacle is the Washington Post, followed by the @nytimes
@brianstelter @poniewozik Da blacks. Da Bwooklyn blacks, dat's all.
@HuffPost B.S. "judge". It has a rational basis. Activist judges SO typical.
The real #zinger https://t.co/dvRqJ2shkj
@andyjamesdalton #SpikeLee telling everybody about how great @nyuniversity film is reminds me of @CoryBooker telling the @senjudiciary what a great law education he got in "ConLaw" because they let him in @YaleLawSch. smh
Any #jazz fans: "Green Book" is a sensational pick for #BestPicture. FORGET #SpikeLee! And #GreenBookMovie has a great @YouTube soundtrack right here: You can literally listen to the real deal all day. https://t.co/YOhZv8AhdH
@andyjamesdalton This selection by the @TheAcademy almost makes you think there are still actual ARTISTS in #Hollywood. #Oscars2019
@andyjamesdalton Orpheus in the Underworld. Racial overtones? Separate track, segregation? Probably. https://t.co/AZ6pTVcHnA Important for today? DEFINITELY yes. Here he sounds like Erik Satie. A true artist. With a bouncer, Aragorn.
@andyjamesdalton A lot of great jazz pianists (not all) are classically trained, because as Billy Taylor said, jazz is America's classical music. There would have been hipper black pianists around New York where #SpikeLee is. Don Shirley music would have more appreciation and fans around South.
@andyjamesdalton So leading a jazz workshop at @UMNews I invited the late great Roberta Davis and she's the  only one who wouldn't let us play with her. Instead she brought two pianists, Kenny Barron and Tommy Flanagan. She sang and they played all day. They played Debussy duet classical.
@ava Here's the man: https://t.co/mDngqu7RKZ Like jazz musicians he was hip, he just knew about the book. He didn't write it or endorse it. See Dale in "Round Midnight" (another musician, Dexter)
@andyjamesdalton I can tell you right now "Bridge Over Troubled Waters" should be the title song for this movie. Here's a beatiful recording of it. https://t.co/mDngqu7RKZ
@andyjamesdalton #DonShirley reminds me a lot of Dr. Reginald Buckner, a music school faculty member at @UMNews whose work I really enjoyed. We collaborated to some degree to pass a jazz requirement for @umncla music majors. No #SpikeLee would not like this story.
@NBCNews See it gets worse for Brooklyn tripper #SpikeLee. Here's Don Shirley https://t.co/RbtEv546bu. He plays with white musicians. Like they're peers. It's not just the driver. He sounds like of like Oscar Peterson or Erroll Garner or something. Classical oriented. Good movie.
@NBCNews No longer jazz pianist, now the  directors who dress like Cab Calloway call him a black piano player. What narcissism.
@ava Source of love? It looks to me like the  movie is about scandal, the scandal of the impact of forced black-white segregation that you can't even imagine at your age, and that it about an outrage. Not about a black guy being in the KKK! I think @TheAcademy chose well.
@washingtonpost Really? It looks to me like it's about #JimCrow, segregation of public and private accommodations. Polite? Restrained? White centered? Seems like it affected the black jazz pianist? Maybe you can't see the movies anymore. @BarackObama didn't get this, you're fanciful.
@AdamSerwer Yeah, yeah "country in denial". That's real objective. So the country has psychological problems then?
@amyklobuchar But Amy knows she has to bump into @SenGillibrand @KamalaHarris @SenWarren who are ALSO women and who got there first. And are black and all that, from more populous states, etc.
@amyklobuchar I saw @amyklobuchar tied with @JoaquinCastrotx at 1% of @TheDemocrats voters in a poll the other day. Right now it's @JoeBiden @SenSanders. BUT those are two white men and Amy knows she has the gender quotas in Iowa, Minnesota, etc. to ELIMINATE them. Yes.
@amyklobuchar Klobuchar has been in the @USSenate while this was passed. Now her advisers told her she has to get the middle class so she's becoming the populist socialist. So did business and consumer borrowing contribute to big bank profit? She doesn't know. Just headlines. No traction.
@davidrobertgrov @LindseyGrahamSC @newtgingrich @PressSec @senatemajldr @ABC @WCCO @NBCNews @foxheadlines @MPRnews @nprpolitics @SpeakerPelosi You're in a party where your ability to participate as a voting delegate, even if your peers select you, is "capped" by LAW because you're a male (50%), white (down to 40%), and it goes down from there.

Aren't they supposed to be objective?" I said "I guess you're right". They despised Bush and LOVED @BillClinton because he was going to boost non-whites.

@davidrobertgrov @LindseyGrahamSC @newtgingrich @PressSec @senatemajldr @ABC @WCCO @NBCNews @foxheadlines @MPRnews @nprpolitics @SpeakerPelosi I could hardly hear my teacher (from @DefenseLanguage) above the din. She repeated, "Don't you think there's something wrong here." I put down my pen (Clinton was saying something like "my administration will look like the face..."). She said, aren't these people supposed to..."
@davidrobertgrov @LindseyGrahamSC @newtgingrich @PressSec @senatemajldr @ABC @WCCO @NBCNews @foxheadlines @MPRnews @nprpolitics @SpeakerPelosi So Phil Gramm addressed the convention first. Crickets. Not even polite applause from thousand or so attendees. Then @BillClinton appeared. The place went WILD. Getting the picture. You know me, I'm concentrating on what he said, over the din. My teacher leans across the table.
@davidrobertgrov @LindseyGrahamSC @newtgingrich @PressSec @senatemajldr @ABC @WCCO @NBCNews @foxheadlines @MPRnews @nprpolitics @SpeakerPelosi I went to Washington D.C. for the Asian American Journalists Association @aaja in like '91, year Bush lost, my teacher was a Bush official and Phil Gramm and @BillClinton made "appearances" (Clinton on the back wall filled with a giant screen). Gramm was married to Asian Wendy.
@davidrobertgrov @LindseyGrahamSC @newtgingrich @PressSec @senatemajldr @ABC @WCCO @NBCNews @foxheadlines @MPRnews @nprpolitics @SpeakerPelosi Now, I'm not stupid and I don't think the press should be limited to covering only the  items a public official wanted them to or wanted to present to them, let's say #TheWall. And they need to get views from many others, and be objective in covering it. But they ignore it all.
@davidrobertgrov @LindseyGrahamSC @newtgingrich @PressSec @senatemajldr @ABC @WCCO @NBCNews @foxheadlines @MPRnews @nprpolitics @SpeakerPelosi I want to be clear David: the governor, mayor whatever would call the press conference, hand out all this stuff, make themselves available. These guys from #fakenews would show up and ask NOTHING about what was said, not report about it, set their #fakenews agenda. Lie to people
@davidrobertgrov @LindseyGrahamSC @newtgingrich @PressSec @senatemajldr @ABC @WCCO @NBCNews @foxheadlines @MPRnews @nprpolitics @SpeakerPelosi So as a full-time news reporter and editor I covered any story I felt would be of interest to readers. I could get a press pass to ANY event, and I covered press conferences, and saw all these #fakenews reporters right there with me. They ALWAYS ignored the press conference.
@davidrobertgrov @LindseyGrahamSC @newtgingrich @PressSec @senatemajldr @ABC @WCCO @NBCNews @foxheadlines @MPRnews @nprpolitics @SpeakerPelosi David, as a professional journalist myself, I'm aware the problem is far deeper than that. Here's what lawyers, officials, spies reporters and broadcasters do, and many politicians: "We of course have our own opinions OFF-camera but we would NEVER let them affect our work as..."
@nytimes Now back to the REALLY bad actors....
@CBSNews And in other news.....I'm pretty sure this had nothing to do with #fakenews charges. So @SpeakerPelosi what is going on in your city?
@TPNN_ThePoint They're not that high...
@washingtonpost "Weaponize reproductive rights", #WaPo? That's  like saying "weaponize homicide rights"? @TinaSmithMN @amyklobuchar
@WLTX She looks mad.
I think this is a good thing, and have long pointed out that this is something the two (or more) sides should do to normalize relations and allow concrete steps to disarmament. @JChengWSJ @POTUS @VP. I hope it happens. https://t.co/AgWplNK1sb
@Newsweek So I'll tell what I get out of @JohnCornyn quote, @amyklobuchar: When you impose cap on men voting in your nomination process, a cap on whites, blacks, straights, non-Muslims, non-Somalians like @MinnesotaDFL does you cut back our individual liberties to vote. YOU are like Mussol
@Newsweek As long as it's an elective...slave pride month.
@newsbysamuels @dandrezner Well, I'll check it out. Is it really a friendship? I'll check it. I consider it intercultural friendship. This one looks pretty professional. A couple of outsiders, is that what I see from the screenshots? Anyway I'll check it out. Thanks.
@clarencehilljr @rolandsmartin It is a really bad thing when people go unappreciated. That is what we need to work on as a people.
@WLTX Stage left.
Yeah, #HairSaladAmy #amyDearest tell them about how you cap men so you can pretend you win. https://t.co/jlIiwhbtkX
@chicagotribune This appears to be a serious use of the medium of film. Not a remake of 48 hours with Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte either.
@nytimes @rolandsmartin I thought it was Cab Calloway just sayin'
@thehill Extreme race pride.
@latimes Yes, it looks pretty cool, I'll have to check it out.
@rolandsmartin So let Spike define it all, right? Why can't he just use the medium? He's overly dramatic.
@guybranum @AlexDe_Luca I don't think so. I don't you're funny. And I don't think you know what you're talking about.
@rolandsmartin Viggo.
@newsbysamuels @dandrezner Yeah, no interracial friendships because you say so.
@rolandsmartin @NewsPolitics Looks like a more serious film that Spike's satirical tale.
@jillianbowe @rolandsmartin I think he suggested also that Viggo Mortenson should have won best actor or whatever.
@TPNN_ThePoint Yeah, sure, Spike, real good, a KKK movie. smh
@lisasharper @GuthrieGF Aristotle was a slave. DUH
@lisasharper @GuthrieGF I'm sure #SpikeLee has never heard of Aristotle.
@cornellbelcher @benensonj You are ignorant. Yes, I know ignorance.
@washingtonpost You want to be a better doctor? A better person? Then HELP these women #FightLikeAGirl https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A
@R400Movement @rolandsmartin Didn't mention who got the gold. Of course not.
@MatthewACherry @rolandsmartin Oh, I thought it was the sound going out then figured yes, this dude is talking trash.
@thehill No, he was extremely partisan.
@ajc But it is not true that people were trashed for trying to live lives with dignity as @repjohnlewis claims. Yes, we need to help each other do that, and that's what John should concentrate on, not attacking other races.
@dandrezner You usually are.
@thehill Yeah, I heard that. So what? He didn't condemn #TheWall. Anyway it's dumb to condemn walls.
More smart-ss comments from #barbarastreisand
Let's just say #SpikeLee is a smart man, but could learn a LOT from #ForrestGump
@USATODAY I am. I'm rejecting #SpikeLee. Not a hater. He is.
@washingtonpost This is why I haven't been watching for years. A coincidence tonight and I was right.
@washingtonpost And he messes it up.
@JudyWoodruff @mitchellreports Yeah, what #spikelee thinks would have been the "right thing" is elected @HillaryClinton, duh.
@kylebuchanan @nytimes They cut away because he wouldn't shut up.
@usatodaylife @USATODAY Moron #SpikeLee Mr. hate.
I just feel #spikelee would have a MUCH better career if he wasn't all racial. He has talent, subject matter, but gets bogged down.
Of course #spikelee needs to talk a lot of stuff at #AcademyAwards2019. Moron. 400 years ago Africans SOLD other Africans for gold and they joined other indentured servants. What happened after that has a lot of bad in it. Some good. Not all racial, focus, Spike!
@stranahan And #AndrewMcCabe was getting his info from those sources, isn't that what he's saying? Or do you think he is not specifying? I think I saw him say he had this stuff. Still  working on the #breastcancer treatment lawsuit so I can't track all this down, if I had resources.
@VelmaHamdan @mark_s_bell @JChengWSJ First of all, this is about much more than North Korea....
@SusanPage The problem we have is that @EdWGillespie is NOT thoughtful, and neither are you, Susan, and yet you purport to speak for all of us. So he is happy to bash Virginia for votes, bash whites for votes. Yes, I've thought whether #WhiteLivesMatter https://t.co/UMmpb55Rn9
@christophclarey @nytimes Way to #FightLikeAGirl https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A Kikkan. Do you know they're cancelling the #breastcancer treatment coverage while women are in treatment? Yep, @AGEllison the people's lawyer is doing that.
@washingtonpost So just to be clear there's something wrong with white Oscar activity? I don't think so. Besides, you usually overlook all the non-blacks #OscarsSoWhite
@ThisWeekABC #AndrewMcCabe now I got @stranahan here saying that stuff you had is from the Ukraine. Is that right, Lee, do I have that right? If not, please clarify, but Andy was WAY off.
@ThisWeekABC I'm sorry but this guy is such a pr*ck. Can I say that? @RepAdamSchiff
@Scaramucci @POTUS Of course. He wants more than a momentary "understanding". And more than a momentary tariff schedule. I assume he wants principles. @realDonaldTrump
@mikefreemanNFL @rolandsmartin Why does anyone need a stadium around a 100-yard field?
@mikefreemanNFL @rolandsmartin A party maybe? If you're from a landlocked state?

@JamesPindell @nypost I told you to watch out for Snow #GenderQuota Queen #HairSaladAmy, @BilldeBlasio. She bring snow wherever she go.
@mark_s_bell @JChengWSJ And you think this is funny.
@ThisWeekABC So here's a new twist. @RepAdamSchiff thinks the Special Counsel statute allows HIM to subpoena #RobertMueller! Yep! So any MOC could have subpoened Archibald Cox. #CaliforniaLooney

@smithers_janet Pigeon=/=statue
@Squirrel3218 @washingtonpost Aude =/= sapere
I think THIS man is being investigated right now. @BarackObama interfering in the U.S. Constitution because he THOUGHT he could get away with it. #HairSaladAmy https://t.co/Tx91CFy7OX
@politico Yeah, "obviously subpoena" @RepAdamSchiff. You see that in the Constitution somewhere do you? Nixon mistakenly complied. I question whether you even have the power you claim is so "obvious."
@thehill HAH! @KamalaHarris you can NOT compete with the #HairSaladAmy COMBS! Have you seen them? They're beautiful. While you eat your salad, you get policy advice from @amyklobuchar to CLEAN IT after you eat. What more could your mother wish for?
@washingtonpost Confederate =/= "racist".
@davidrobertgrov Yep. Just wondering how  efficient it is. I would guess more efficient than space power station China is building. @vp @potus @ENERGY
See #HairSaladAmy this is how it is done! #IcelandElection was 48% women most equal in world without #genderquota. Just so @StarTribune @duluthnews @PB_News @PioneerPress UNDERSTAND that this is a real thing, not just a @SteveWCarlson idea or something. https://t.co/D3nF4B2Tah

@SusanPage Sorry Susan we already know you're #fakenews. We'll be investigating YOU for helping to overthrow the U.S. government by force.
@NewsHour Don't be stupid, @potus is doing a GREAT job. #fakenews
@MrWalterShapiro Yeah but he's a @TheDemocrats so it doesn't matter. Until the #genderentitlement caps against males being voting delegates in nominating caucuses and conventions kick in, knocking him out as #HairSaladAmy sails through in a cakewalk.
@brithume @JohnHMerrill I watched it. It shows @EdWGillespie IS a racist, because he had never thought #WhiteLivesMatter. #AllLivesMatter they DO matter, Brit. https://t.co/UMmpb55Rn9

@Heritage @HotlineJosh @EdWGillespie @GovernorVA Elucidating as this discussion is, @EdWGillespie comes off as kind of a dummy. I would have thought #WhiteLivesMatter #AllLivesMatter #BlackLivesMatter as soon as I read about @RalphNortham live birth idea. https://t.co/UMmpb55Rn9

@NRO @AndrewCMcCarthy In #Gitmo
@thehill @jaketapper blithering as usual.
@nytpolitics @Neil_Irwin @UpshotNYT Not true. What is true is that YOU have completely ignored calls to reverse the deficit and debt by transitioning the power and resources from Washington back to 50 states, as I have called for since 2010 and @MittRomney also has supported in his 2012 run. (till he said 47%...
@davidrobertgrov @amyklobuchar @PioneerPress Why not ask the @WhiteHouse to ask scientists to review your idea. I'm not sure it would reduce conditions for hurricanes. Nonetheless, if there is a means of recovering the energy as you say, it might be looked at. Private investment, etc. Scientific research.
This is a great idea, @amyklobuchar I hope you too will support it, as I do. https://t.co/nU5ECAZ02B
@postpolitics It doesn't contradict @potus, your brain is addled.
@politico @jahimes the closure will come when we investigate @comey and the #DeepState actors who tried to overthrow our government and seize power unconstitutionally. #RobertMueller report will be investigated.

@washingtonpost New way to razz the pitcher. "Tick-tock, tick-tock, don't forget the pitcher's clock."
@thehill I'm sure there are still some people singing and picking cotton in South Carolina. That is not a bad thing. So I think this educational outing had a lot of value. It's not all about hate as you're portraying it.
@AHMalcolm It's not, Andrew. There is a rational basis for the distinction. Also for transgender. 5th Am. Plus powers given to President in Constitution.
@dgelles @nytimes Theory J, right Ed? Dinkytown? @Delta
#HairSaladAmy don't pull your salad out. https://t.co/9wEdrbUPeT
@StephanieKelton @Atlanta4Bernie I honestly don't see by @SenSanders would not back this approach to free higher education. Although #HairSaladAmy rejects it it's currently in the Minnesota Constitution. https://t.co/7DD9UePgTB I show it's NOT socialism, and not too big or ambitious.
@thehill @neal_katyal ADMITS it's a witchhunt. @potus. These are the enemies of  democracy and enemies of the Republic. #HairSaladAmy, #RobertMueller #AndrewMcCabe @Comey 3rd-world @BarackObama #genderentitled @HillaryClinton @DNC #FakeNews
@cspan @amyklobuchar Just remember: @SenSanders and @JoeBiden might be leading the field NOW, but they won't be once @SenAmyKlobuchar sticks the #genderquota caps against male participation in choosing the nominee, in state after state from @MinnesotaDFL to the @DNC. Remember as they disappear.
@creynoldsnc This is obvious hypocrisy @katieporteroc #HairSaladAmy. Then I challenge you to stop capping delegatemen in your nominating caucuses and conventions. Then maybe we'll introduce gender references for you if you can actually get ELECTED without #genderquota entitlements.
@FaceTheNation @RoyBlunt @margbrennan Well, @RoyBluntPress then @POTUS can do that. I don't see why a case should begin unless he touches funds he supposedly is not allowed to touch. I don't see any kind of  provision about "asked Congress, Congress didn't do." Do you? #HairSaladAmy
@USATODAY #fakenews. That's not what @realDonaldTrump said. Expected dissembling and falsification from @USATODAY smh
@TomCrann @MPRnews Thank you for the weather report, Tom. Now what about those caps preventing males from joining voting delegations selecting #HairSaladAmy as "nominee" for @USSenate? No comment?
Yeah, this guy was "disrupting" Iowa classrooms with political expression. Question presented to @USSupremeCourt for Review: Should #HairSaladAmy combs be allowed to be distributed in Iowa public schools? https://t.co/YFMANN65hx
@joelpollak But there was a sealed sentencing document or something.
@USATODAY No, it hasn't passed. There is a rational basis for gender-based roles in defending the nation.
@NewsHour So we need to #AirDrop it in @SecPompeo. May need to take out their  airpower first. What kind of AAA do they have? Can mediators convince Maduro to stop blocking aid?
@politico We know what happened @jahimes. You lost, and your anti-American @BarackObama manipulated "intel" to overthrow the government. You didn't know about this?
@EthanObama @amyklobuchar is smarter than @KamalaHarris and prosecuted Kirby Puckett.
@SouthbyNE @MSNBC @amjoyshow @K_JeanPierre @JamilSmith @DrJasonJohnson @TiffanyDCross I'll bring the salads. #HairSaladAmy #amydearest
@thecjpearson @TeaPartyNevada That's right. We're building cages around people's minds that others, from other countries, aren't in. @amikegreen2
@thehill @PhilBryantMS well it's not only that but @BarackObama had to inject race into it, like attacking police officers and the like, like @GovMarkDayton did, directly resulting in the deaths of six Dallas officers. We need to take race OUT OF it.
@mkraju @HotlineJosh I don't want my children to bear burden of nuclear arms is what KJU said to have told @SecPompeo.
@mkraju @HotlineJosh And there could be a threat in the future, obviously @jaketapper @SecPompeo. Now I SAW that KJU said he didn't want future generations of NK'ers to be "burdened" with nuclear weapons is what I think he said.

@KurtSchlichter "Russians" are after #HairSaladAmy. Don't give her a salad!
@WashTimes So this wouldn't be partisan or anything would it @RepAdamSchiff
@Newsweek @RepJerryNadler bone-headed remark.
@thehill That's a big difference from "there is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea". That doesn't mean there couldn't be one in the future, @jaketapper.
@thehill So @jaketapper here is the tweet you refer to: "there is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea." Do you see how this differs from what's in your "mind"? Anybody is a nuclear threat. Do they pose it now, are they threatening, for instance? smh @amyklobuchar
@iSheyman @hmcghee I thought it was all about science?
@GKButterfield He just said it. @realDonaldTrump
@FreeBeacon So #HairSaladAmy, #ImTheBoss @RepAOC says how about that, you WILL vote for her "New Green Deal" and you like is @SenAmyKlobuchar. Your answer is awaited.
@Newsweek I agree with @POTUS. We want more than a Memorandum of Understanding with China. I know to #fakenews #newsweek that's just "terminology" but that is because they are ignorant, and their own publisher wouldn't rely on a MOU. A tariff needs to be part of the contract.
@CBSNews @EdMarkey @SenMarkey explain why you are overreaching to block the continuation to #BuildTheWall? Same to #HairSaladAmy #AmyDearest candidate @amyklobuchar. How DISLOYAL and dishonest can you be?
@ThisWeekABC Uh, @GovRichardson but didn't KJU already give that commitment?
@kathrynw5 So quote the direct quote @jaketapper
@chucktodd What did Jeh Johnson EVER do to protect the #SouthernBorder?
@thehill @RepAdamSchiff your @DNC has disgraced itself as your LOSER legacy nominating a devious, dishonest @HillaryClinton because she was married to @BillClinton. You have degraded the majesty of our Republic, whose enemy you are.
@chucktodd #JehJohnson is an anti-American failure who has nothing to say about securing the border, he and his partner @BarackObama don't like America very much, they promote crime and #OpenBorders.
@mitchellreports @chucktodd @MeetThePress So you said something about hating white people? I think you need to stop talking that way, somehow. Stop abusing your #fakenews business.
@ThisWeekABC You ignorant enemy of the country #AndrewMcCabe history will define you as at best an ass.
@StribOpinion @stribgillespie The @StarTribune knows and has actually reported, once @sturdevant attacking #TeaParty that there are no @MinnesotaDFL elections in Minnesota. The state law supports a women's Stalinist party which excludes and caps men, whites, straights. And limits minorities to population.
@ThisWeekABC It means, #AndrewMcCabe that you are a political bureaucrat who threatens and destroys American democracy by abusing the trust Americans stupidly gave you and your master @BarackObama. Got that?
@LifeNewsHQ @obianuju His boyfriend doesn't like it. They have "jobs" paid for by the government.

@BuckSexton This is satire, correct?
@PeteThamel @rolandsmartin They kneeled in disrespect of our National Anthem. Not Confederates.
@CBSNews So let's ask the question: Why do the police allow these deplorable conditions?
@NYDailyNews Seems like you MUST be lying because right in the same sentence you say they kneeled in response to the Naitonal Anthem. Don't you think someone might be able to read?
@kyledcheney @kathrynw5 These are @HillaryClinton lying lawyers who write very badly.
@charliekirk11 @JohnHMerrill @amyklobuchar also used her famous comb to remove #thewall from her salad. She lied in #Election2018 and it left a bad taste, so she ordered staff to have her support removed.
@LifeNewsHQ She needs to be put under arrest.
@FRCdc Don't be stupid. Killers of babies don't deserve respect and have no dignity.
@TheDemocrats Yeahright. If they were "fierce" they wouldn't need to be mollycoddled by #genderquotas that prevent men from participating.

@NYDailyNews You're disrespecting the flag again.
@NYDailyNews Well, he IS from Boston...Your "argument" that #RobertKraft needed to know he was engaged in a criminal activity also would bar all prostitution because you argue he is expected to know, a denial by a woman can't be trusted. I note you're not about abolishing the Florida arrangmt
@ashlynshockley @amprog @RepBarbaraLee What Chisholm told Lee was incorrect. @RepBarbaraLee does not know what changes to make. Because elected officials change, we're all on the  outside looking  in, with limited power and roles. We need to learn to use it and what to use it  for. #AmyDearest
@TheOfficerTatum @TeaPartyNevada @realDonaldTrump Obviously true. We could argue about @BarackObama but he wasn't really "pro" anything that's the problem. He lacked the experience and skills.
@LindaSuhler @TeaPartyNevada How many of them actually owned the  land that would be taken by eminent domain to #BuildTheWall, do you know? I don't raise the issue in opposition. Just inquiry.
@Newsweek These prosecutors are violating federal election laws and should be prosecuted for retaliation, blackmail, bribery and deterring people from seeking elective office. #AmyDearest @amyklobuchar
@amikegreen2 @latimes @SteveKingIA @nytimes @mndailynews @aapress All that stuff was passed by #WalterMondale and he didn't even know what he was voting for, he admits it in his #TheGoodFight which wasn't good. We need to go back over that. It was still a North-South battle unrelated to actual progress.
@amikegreen2 So do you know late Parrish Mitchell? I talked to Parrish Mitchell in Minneapolis.
@amikegreen2 African slavery was definitely a flaw, and inequality exists in many forms, but opportunity and liberty can't be brushed off by focusing on race.
@amikegreen2 Don't think this is a correct reading of history, history needs to be vastly improved, including Cultural Pluralism as we envisioned it at the University of Minnesota @umncla
@amikegreen2 Personally I would not cling to the black identity. Most of that is a false identity anyway, you're much more straight American than you realize. Don't assume a gap because of race.
@amikegreen2 Competition is not necessary. Opportunity is here and is an indispensable element of the progress you seek. Beginning with real education. You are an engineer, you know how important that is. You should keep studying, CE, and build a Ph.D. leading into other areas, writing it.
@amikegreen2 @latimes @SteveKingIA @nytimes @mndailynews @aapress I'll check it out.
@amikegreen2 @latimes @SteveKingIA @nytimes @mndailynews @aapress Booker T.
@amikegreen2 @latimes @SteveKingIA @nytimes There are no segregationist policies in schools and housing. Or in economic development (there's just not enough of it). Or zoning or at the @MetCouncilNews. Or in @GovTimWalz office. At @umncla yes. And it should not continue. You're limited by @MinnesotaDFL quotas, though.
@amikegreen2 @latimes @SteveKingIA @nytimes @mndailynews @aapress Yes, I see what it is. I knew about that, yes. I don't think I'll agree with the start and end points. It hasn't ended. It began with the founding of America.
@amikegreen2 @latimes @SteveKingIA @nytimes Actually as a child I learned of the ideas that they don't take care of their lawns and drive property values down. I questioned it. Have continued to oppose conclusions based on race. As I said, people have a right to dispose of their private property as they wish, usually.
@GOPChairwoman @KurtSchlichter So serious question. Wouldn't it be better to file a lawsuit against this action and overturn this extension of Roe v. Wade in the @USSupremeCourt?
@AaronBlake @amyklobuchar is the beneficiary  of the #genderquotas which exclude men from selecting the nominee, and excite women into believing they're "winning" and that they have "great ideas" for America. When they don't.
@rolandsmartin @Patriots I think the conditions and treatment of women is the big issue here. Hopefully #RobertKraft can help fight this.

@JoyceWhiteVance Let's talk about #amyDearest. Stuff like that. Reality.
Isn't this obvious by now? #amyDearest But her staffers CAN'T have any! https://t.co/l5fR3pil59
@CNN She probably mistakenly believed this was some kind of creative genius in policy, like she thinks she's saving American elections. Or saying she tried to help @realDonaldTrump #BuildTheWall when it benefited her, but now tries to overthrow him on the same issue.
Exactly, this is what I'm talking about, Amy actually violated Minnesota law. It's ILLEGAL, #AmyDearest, to retaliate against your employees in this way! Even if you're contacted, you can only confirm they worked for you, not try to HURT them! @amyklobuchar https://t.co/9VxOxw0ZgU
More #AmyDearest accusers come forward. She's acting like #JussieSmollett, attempting to turn her bizarre behavior into some kind of benefit. @amyklobuchar, Smollett has been REMOVED from Empire. https://t.co/sxr2ME3yjT
Knew she would use  money to try to turn this into an appeal, passing out 50,000 #AmyDearest combs in Iowa and so forth. But I think her supporters are missing the point. She needs to address this seriously. Her behavior is not acceptable, and it's bizarre. Contacting employers?? https://t.co/FoJj1dvIeX
@amikegreen2 @latimes @SteveKingIA Of course you believe any #fakenews. Your engineering background does not prepare you for this analysis Mike. I think you can contribute to economic development projects with more business experience. Keep working. But King is not a "racist." Study history. If you want.
@amyklobuchar While I've seen evidence of some warming, we don't know it isn't within the range to be expected. Don't know the cause or the effects. Don't know how it could be addressed, or consequences of our intended actions. ALL science, you don't have it. Things we can do.. #climatechange
@SecretarySonny @POTUS Anyone at @MNFarmfest who followed my calls to fast-track agriculture knows this is what I wanted, Food should never be used  as a weapon. Feed your people. Don't destroy food production capacity. @duluthnews @potus @vp @mankatonews @amyklobuchar (bring a comb)
@Newsweek It's increasingly clear that @amyklobuchar @RepAdamSchiff @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer are violating FEDERAL LAW prohibiting acts intended to deter and retaliate against ANYONE for running for federal office. Look 'em up @POTUS this is not legal, unconstitutional.
The good old days at @mndailynews https://t.co/RTAOOcLAkC
@politico This man was motivated by an illegal power seizure by the #fakenews and leaders like @SenSchumer and @SpeakerPelosi et al. Actions of @alfranken @DNC amplifies by #FakeNewsMedia caused this man to use opioids at work, attracting attention.
@ron_fournier Purple rage, pu-urple rage.....Purple rage, pu-urple rage......#AmyDearest.
@Newsweek Whoops, wait, @alfranken and #RobertMueller might double-team him to catch him in the perjury trap!
@politico Bet Roger won't say nuthin' about that.
@thehill @SpeakerPelosi space cadet
@JarBomb @KurtSchlichter You have to show me
LOL https://t.co/tZ253RFerr
See #AmyDearest why can't you and your staff members get on like these two do? @SenAmyKlobuchar https://t.co/Zdm9TTV1Hq
@brandondarby @realDonaldTrump is right @GlennKesslerWP is #fakenews
Hallelujah! @TinaSmithMN @PPact https://t.co/saU3MXLnSl
@AaronBlake @dandrezner She is very right. @PressSec
@ThisWeekABC #fastTrackFood @SecretarySonny @VP @POTUS
@thehill See now #BrettKavanaugh @BrettKavanaugh question to her "have you?" is starting to make sense.
@DMRegister I suggest @amyklobuchar order 50,000 combs from a specialty shop to pass out on the TRAIL.
@ANTHONYBLOGAN No, I think it was after using the comb. #amyDearest
@julia_azari @dandrezner Yes, frankly #AmyDearest belongs in a home economics class.@SenAmyKlobuchar
@mattsgorman #AmyDearest
@latimes I agree with @SteveKingIA @amikegreen2
@thehill Toast.
The wonders of modern photography. https://t.co/YqHS56uq0X
@thehill @KristiNoem I hope you will join me in urging @SecretarySonny and @VP and @POTUS to fast-track food production in trade negotiations with #China.
@RWPUSA @realDonaldTrump @RWPMinnesota is combing the metaphor for advantage. Stretches ethical boundaries.
Weird. He has nice handwriting. ??? https://t.co/zvVLoOKUQL
Oh, no #AmyDearest! @RWPMinnesota jumps into the fray! @TinaSmithMN does @PPact use @amyklobuchar-style combs for partial birth abortions? https://t.co/b9HYC4sHSD

@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @insightnews You'd be pissed if the Dutch Navy burned your stuff down.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @insightnews Yeah, it's not easy to find joy in this stuff. The powers that be be.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @insightnews Again, your use of the word "fact" is not defined. Anything you want to think you feel the right to term a fact. I am attacking your factual assumptions. Kind of like a lawsuit.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @insightnews You're right, you don't offer a strand of thought about solutions. For $1500/day. So you're a shrink then?
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @insightnews So as the former engineer, let's revisit these "evil massacres". What are you talking about here? Anyone who will attack white people, even other white people?
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @insightnews I believe all Indians were given the vote in 1925. And of course Indians intermarried quite a bit and many have voted for a long time. Owned land, businesses, homes, things like that.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @insightnews Mexico  was a Spanish territory. Then Minneapolis became part of the French claim, bought by Jefferson in the Louisiana purchase. Indian policy needs to be carefuly considered. But there is a great deal of good in it. We can and do co-exist, and all Indians are not American cits
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @insightnews @USSenate Most of the Western lands are still the property of the U.S. Congress. They don't belong to the "settlers" as you imagine.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @insightnews @USSenate They're still there. And those Mexicans who chose to remain north of the Rio Grande a year after the ratification because American citizens.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @insightnews See, I'm pissed too, because the entire Dutch Navy sailed in and wiped out New Sweden. Just before the Duke of York voided their title with New York.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @insightnews And I think this is our problem with history. You want to annihilate it rather than live rationally and productively within it. I consider that irrational.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @insightnews So basically you start out by wanting to remove restrictive covenants and move to destroying the United States of America to right "racial wrongs".
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @insightnews Well, it goes all the way out to California and John Fremont. Where I grew up (Minneapolis) was claimed by Spain, of course. And then DeLaSalle famously made a speech at St. Anthony Falls, I believe, claiming it for The Sun King., so... there's all kinds of ideas.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @insightnews Violated how? You mean not entirely ratified by the @USSenate is that what you're referring to? The Mexican government land titles?
@SNienow She's toast
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL @BillyGraham Oh, right, you CAN'T be a racist. What I'm saying is you are distorting the facts based on your perception of a race. You could call that bias. Racial bias is that better?
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL @BillyGraham I know of his  statement about Billy Graham. Yes, I have been quite interested in MLK of course, growing up during his time. I've read a lot of his speeches. I'm not aware he wrote many books.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @insightnews Originally they established colonies further north than the  French, Spanish and Portuguese had done so. They felt better land use would benefit all in the New World. Relations with the various Indian tribes were taken seriously. As you know.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @insightnews You asked where it came from.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @insightnews Most of incursion into Dakota lands was by Objibwe migrating west. Review land law system. A treaty system developed and I think it shold be followed. Just as it should with Mexico, Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.
@rapplerdotcom My sympathies and hopes to get well soon to @KarlTowns
@SNienow Most of us wash our combs before using them to eat, even if we're very hungry.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL @BillyGraham Well, sorry to say, you seem to be kind of a racist. Work on that.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL @BillyGraham MLK did not believe he was a bigot. You do, though.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL @CityMinneapolis I'll send you a bill for my consulting fee.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL @CityMinneapolis Yeah, Steve. Ran for President in 2016 where I encountered Trump.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL Now you  can read that American history and  reject it. My people, settlers in Minnesota are not free to do that. But perhaps you feel that you are.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL It is a sequitur.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @MNSpokesman I answered your question, the property belonged to proprietors chartered by the king of England.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @insightnews The colonies had proprietors chartered by the  king. That's  where the private property came from. Just the facts.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @insightnews You don't know what private property means, obviously. Get a law school textbook on Property, read it and discuss. Seriously, you need to learn this, and you can't just ignore it. It goes back to English law. Read it.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec It's a historical fact. Again see Folwell.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL @CityMinneapolis Anyway grab a comb and enjoy your salad.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL @umncla I constantly do homework, and I have been able to discern some of your ill-defined thinking and have noted. I would recommend Schlesinger's 1983 Almanac of American History. Give you a broader perspective perhaps you should supplement.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL Restricing it to Minneapolis, its foundation was not segregationist policies. Indians were excluded from voting but had their own sovereign nations. So white in our Constitution referred to that before it changed. For sovereign Indians.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL I do not believe the views in those signs were at all typical. I'm not kidding. Nor does your https://t.co/u5M1k4lNAx post show those signs were typical. @BillyGraham had his headquarters in Minneapolis. Those were not his views, nor the tens of thousands who attended his events
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL @umncla I'm not going to list your sweeping generalizations.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL White's a color, as I told the Minneapolis Minority Media Coalition.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL @CityMinneapolis Private property. So if the value goes down, the family's estate is lost or diminished. Can you understand that? It wasn't only applied to non-whites. And that's significant.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL Robert E Lee is an American hero for  winning the Mexican American War.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @MNSpokesman Again, MOIST of that is private property, banks are private. As for FHA regs, yes, I've addressed those, and have worked with HUD (through newspapers), SBA to advance opportunity.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @insightnews I have carefully pointed out to you that many of those practices were regarding the disposition of PRIVATE PROPERTY and do not represent public policy. $1500 a day, Mike.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec So you're aware of "white barbarism." Well we could get into some subjects about foreign travel to highlight barbarism. But my argument is that the colonies often turned to physical brutality, as was practiced in Europe, France, etc. Rome. So it's not on account of race.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL @CityMinneapolis Should we also destroy black privilege? Does that exist?
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL Oh, yes, I've perused three volumes of Minnesota History from MN Historical Society by William Folwell.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL I'm for real. I don't share the opinions in those signs. I think they're unusual, that's why they were in the newspaper. And full of sweeping generalizations.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL @umncla I read the first one. Again, you're not being fair and interested in your inquiry. You're selecting putting out statements to prove a pre-determined point. You make SWEEPING generalizations that are not valid. Studied that in school.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL @umncla Show me your PROOF that black educators built them "because of white supremacy." I think you are wrong, and do not accept your "teaching."
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL Well, you responded to "So to be clear and to @BetsyHodges you are alleging  Minneapolis is a "white supremacist" city? @MinnesotaDFL.You're a loon." And then you posted the photo, as if to offer "evidence" for your allegation. But good, refine your point.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL People  also have their own opinions and I don't share these opinions and don't know anyone who shares the opinions on these signs. So how does that fit into yoru analysis?
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL I've just been studying property law in the last couple days (Property flash cards for law school) and I'm aware of the environment. Did you know  that under law the only purpose for real estate is to make a profit for the banks? I'm correct on this. It affects everybody, not rce
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL Obviously it's insane to hold a sign saying keep America white. I learned that in school. So again, you're raising evidence, but you're not evaluating it very effectively and it does not support your argument that Minneapolis is "white supremacy."
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL So these are private individuals. NOT the @CityMinneapolis. I believe the issue here was private property and it still is an issue. Federal fair housing legislation by #WalterMondale was obviously an issue. But Minneapolis itself is not "white supremacist." Changes in private prp
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL I don't think HBCU's were white supremacist institutions. Seriously. So history demands we slow down on the rhetoric and conduct a serious, productive inquiry. Why I supported and penned the Cultural Pluralism Requirement for @umncla. Produce a body of serious academic knowledge.
@KlobsSpaceForce @amyklobuchar I feel better already. Someone pointed out it was a good thing she didn't order spaghetti.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey @BetsyHodges @MinnesotaDFL So you're saying in the North as well? The free blacks, were they not citizens? Were they not allowed to vote by the states? Enlighten me with facts.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec So is @ronfournier involved in this?  So what role specifically is race playing in this rational discourse? And I don't rule out that there is some productive analysis there that might yield needed improvements.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec I'm interested in evaluating evidence.But not with a  pre-determined outcome. That stops the evaluation and only sees in circumstances what one wants to see. Same for American history. You need to consider the totality. You know whites were regularly whipped in colonies right?
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec I don't believe people I've worked with at @MNSpokesman in Minneapolis have ever charged Minneapolis was a "white supremacy" city. There's a need to get feet back on the  ground to have a useful dialogue.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec Let's return to your specific allegations about Minneapolis. A worthwhile place to begin. I'm not challenging your IQ, I just want to be rational. You read in "white supremacy" to some @Jacob_Frey initiative about Minneapolis's past? I just think this is wrong. @insightnews?
@thauserkstp Big question of the day: What is the difference between a dirty comb and a fork? None when you're starved.
Republican strategist takes cheap shot at @MinnesotaDFL @amyklobuchar saying it's a good thing the staff person didn't bring her spaghetti! @SenAmyKlobuchar prez ambitions get messy! https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A https://t.co/6IaDefm039
@TheDemocrats Hey that part about "race", doesn't that include the white race? When you cap white voters allowed on a delegation to select the candidate who will appear on the general election ballot, aren't you abridging the voting right of the white person you exclude?
@mtredden #amyDearest
@brd_dispatch I know Donovan Frank. I can't imagine he's buying this idea of being "heroes". As one of the students witnessing this said, according to the @UMNews internal report: "Man, this is messed up!" @amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar
So this is the case I'm always linking to @amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar because she was @Hennepin Attorney. Now I realize @MikeFreemanHCA had the office after Amy, but...wouldn't a concerned @MinnesotaDFL say SOMETHING? What did she know, when did she know it?
@mtredden @amyklobuchar is in my rap video #FightLikeAGirl for casually allowing my wife's #breastcancer treatment insurance #MABC to be cancelled before her treatment is finished. https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A I think this violates U.S. Constitution. 100s of Minnesota women affected.
@psamsundar NO. WAY! @amyklobuchar?
@IndivisibleMN03 @RepDeanPhillips @JoaquinCastrotx The #NationalEmergencyDeclaration is hardly "fake".
@brianbeutler @amyklobuchar But didnt' they wash it BEFORE they ate their salads?
@darren04 When @SenAmyKlobuchar prez campaign hits a snag, she blames @realDonaldTrump
@KlobsSpaceForce Wow this is a tough one. Can you ask @amyklobuchar if the comb she ate her salad with was clean before she used it?
@TheStagmania I trust she never mentioned any of my tweets.
@TheEconomist Right, she should not be written off. At least not with a comb.... @StephenAtHome @amyklobuchar
PROBABLY @senatemajldr will want to take a look at this. Don't you have SOME kind of rules about paying @USSenate staffers? https://t.co/Z5SRYgvUIT
So I guess this is a joke by @SenAmyKlobuchar: Speaking to her staff "I would trade three of you for a bottle of water." A zinger to be sure, but she "trades" her servants? I don't think Kathryn Hepburn even  topped this in African Queen! @MinnesotaDFL #genderquotas https://t.co/nG0zmPVIdC
@amyklobuchar @Hillary2016MN @keithellison It's an unmeritorious lawsuit.
@TwitterMoments @nytimes @amyklobuchar I would feel a lot less uneasy about @SenAmyKlobuchar if she had ordered the staff person to clean it BEFORE she ate the salad with it. If it were me I would buy my own salad, but that's just me...@MinnesotaDFL
@TwitterMoments @nytimes @amyklobuchar That's scary, @SenAmyKlobuchar. Any comment?
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec See I'm all in favor or effective responses to inequality and to bolster equal opportunity. But when you drop the facts and just begin insults you lose me. Because such an approach must surely fail. Please readjust your attitude.
@moscowlilac @BarackObama does not like America very much.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec This race hustler @amikegreen2 is a paragon of ignorance. smh Incapable of rational discussion.
@amikegreen2 @JackPosobiec @Jacob_Frey is from Philadelphia, not Minnesota. You think his politics change the history of  Minneapolis? So to be clear and to @BetsyHodges you are alleging  Minneapolis is a "white supremacist" city? @MinnesotaDFL.You're a loon.
@JackPosobiec Was tweeting with this @amikegreen2 who was telling me what hubris I had. I told him I'm from Minnesota, we're the ones to stopped slavery helped save the Union. But all he sees is white guy. The Union is the diversity, Italians, Scandinavians, blacks, hispanics, Indians et al
@JackPosobiec There is a bond but our educational system can't figure out what it is. So it's not taught right. The anglo-saxon produced the Constitution and it's under assault from others seeking to tear it down. Like @BarackObama talks the talk he learned but doesn't walk the walk.
@MayoClinic And tell @AGEllison @keithellison to STOP CANCELLING #MABC #breastcancer treatment in the middle of low-income women's cancer treatment! It's preventable! #FightLikeAGirl https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A
@rickdayton @KDKA @KDKAHeather #fakenews is good for something.
@NBCNews @KDLTNews He was heavily medicated and he said he had dreams about it, not that he "aspired". Tramadol, he used at work. Probably attracted a bit of attention. Was concerned @TheDemocrats would seize power by illegal impeachment. With #fakenews help.
@JoelKFGO @SenKevinCramer Sen. Kramer is right. It IS a #NationalEmergency and no joke. Why don't you just let the adults take care of it?
@KTTCTV If they will recover in the next year then that is good news. We should work to ensure they do. Also, @SecretarySonny needs to look at what kind of help farmers might need.
@davidrobertgrov @amyklobuchar That's right, it's inflationary. And not every economy in the U.S. is the same.

@nycsouthpaw @AaronBlake That's not contradiction, Aaron.

#DeepState helping @amyklobuchar get revenge for @HillaryClinton loss. https://t.co/j19dAEjADM
@amyklobuchar There's a lot of question about it. I don't see you getting traction in this race, @SenAmyKlobuchar
@blakehounshell @ron_fournier I think you're taking it out of context. I looked up what was on the wall behind #AmyBermanJackson. By the way you crop the picture you make it appear this is all Stone. But they're from a whole set called Corruption Central. None of the figures are targeted. Check it yourself.
@thehill It doesn't matter #RodRosenstein. These are facts the public has a right to know.
@T_Horner @realDonaldTrump is aware of this. Fund #thewall, build the military, stabilize the world, get America back to work and leading the world. And as I told you since 2010, transition the power and resources back to the 50 states to reverse growth of deficit and debt.
@T_Horner @realDonaldTrump didn't say that. In fact his comments reinforce the fact that he is choosing to expedite the building of #thewall. He said he could still have got it built more slowly. I know the #fakenews chose to portray the remark differently, I don't take them seriously.
@amikegreen2 @woodruffbets I have read closely, inter alia, four times Schlesinger's Almanac of American History. I think his methodology has a lot to recommend it. He picks out specific day by day records in many areas, including black, hispanic, American Indian, etc. Buid on it, refute it, don't erase
@amikegreen2 @woodruffbets In your "facts" you sweep up an entire race, including Minnesota, including Lincoln, including the battle lines of an entire nation, all interpreted from your self-serving perspective, as if the world beyond your dreams simply does not exist. I can't hear you because you can't...
@amikegreen2 @woodruffbets That's your perception, Mike. Which to me is very distorted. As to the "facts" in your article, they're not proven nor are they interpreted correctly. There's truth in there somewhere. But you're viewing just a few circumstances out of historical context. I'm from Minnesota.
@amikegreen2 @woodruffbets The attack on Donald Trump which I'm sure you help foment has nothing to do with the vestiges of servitude. Help people get out of their narrow racial views. No, blackface is not mocking or ridiculing. Much of it is imitation of famous artists.
@amikegreen2 @woodruffbets I still believe it. As far as your piece, you are unfamiliar with conditions in the colonies. They were brutal for all the indentured servants, and you choose to ignore that. The problem is people believe you and see only race. And it's just not true. Keep studying.
@NJConservative_ Correct, she shouldn't even be a judge and @BarackObama should never have been in the @WhiteHouse. It was rigged. I'm not  impressed by her. He had no malicious intent.
@jdaniel3636 @JoyceWhiteVance I had a bench warrant once because a federal judge didn't care the @UMNews stole my financial aid then lied about it to the U.S. Government. Wicked judges.
@DaShanneStokes He didn't have "cross-hairs on her". You should do some research on this. Look at Corruption Central.The implication she's corrupt.
@Scout_Finch He's not groveling. But you need to know ever since the days of the Bris choosing the "judges" they have been wicked judges hiding the law  and justice beyond the view of the people.
@matthewamiller It's not at ALL unacceptable Miller. Your cropping of the  background for "corruption center" which is used a number of folks of questionable loyalty to the United States Constitution let's say, is what is unacceptable. Makes you a liar.
@kalhan I agree, I saw the poster and he had no malicious intention. Give it a break.
@StevenBeschloss Nobody threatened the life of a judge, give me a break.
@amikegreen2 @woodruffbets Yes, I believe it.
@dsamuelsohn Fine. We know she's gagging. I give her NO credibility on any kind of findings, that's not what she's trying to do, she's playing poilitics, and we'll get to the bottom of this soon. Then, the history books. @amyklobuchar
@woodruffbets There is certainly nothing threatening about #RogerStone post. It's not complimentary to Jackson because she's grouped with a lot of allegedly anti-American individuals. She is anti-American. #FakeNews has spun this.
@politico Third he's not a "white nationalist".
@politico Well, first of all he was heavily medicated so there's that issue. Secondly, he "dreamed" terrible dreams but any intent is still not clear.
@politico Okay, I looked at "Corruption Central", an organization that puts a lot of controversial figures in front of this wall that uses a kind of targeting device as its symbol. If Amy Berman Jackson is "targeted" then so are all the others. It's CLEARLY not a threat, but not complmntry
@mbieseck @maggieNYT @BillLeeTN @JonathanMattise @ScottStroud1 @AP I don't care, it's fine.
@washingtonpost So here's #AndrewMcCabe the ARCHITECT of the attempted coup but he's not "aware" of it. He's all over TV with the #fakenews. This thing  is a travesty shut it down.
@GinaOrtizJones @creynoldsnc @HurdOnTheHill @JoaquinCastrotx Your #FakeCongress resolution will be and should be vetoed. Stop acting stupid. Liar @amyklobuchar promised she would #BuildTheWall #CrazyCongress
@DavidMDrucker He DOES have nothing to apologize for. To be a reporter you need to be able to tell a story from weird emotions. I reported for @aapress for years. We deal with the same things, but with NEWS, not sentiment and partisan events. Don't fall for the okey-doke. @SteveKingIA
@nytpolitics #RobertMueller to the courtesy counter please. #RobertMueller to the courtesy counter.
@ThisWeekABC There's no serious indictment you are #fakenews political propaganda for your @TheDemocrats
@seanhannity @WitnessforPeace I notice @amyklobuchar follows them too, but they haven't tweeted since late November 2018. Yes, I noticed @Ilhan has been brainwashed.
@AaronBlake They're ALL phony cases. You've become the @NatEnquirer
@cimarcos @scottwongDC NOTHING the @HouseFloor does matters. It's the #CrazyCongress

@ranaantionette @NewsHour @MJGerson @JudyWoodruff You're talking about empty faith, faith without works. So your "choice" is to follow Jesus or not. He IS the therapist, yes even for women. But he has to work with the men too. Mental health does not need to be cured. The effects of sin, of the Fall, of the flesh, yes, need to be
#JussieSmollett might consider an insanity plea. Being a TV personality dealing with race and homosexuality made him crazy and lose his identity. Conversion therapy?
@nytimes Hell has no fury like a #NYTimes scorned. @nytimes
@amyklobuchar It should not be released except for the portions of actual Russian interference. And frankly I think another probe should be set up for that because this one has been corrupted because YOU lost, like you're losing now. Majesty of the United States, not your cheap narcissism.
@ranaantionette @NewsHour @MJGerson @JudyWoodruff You're right I don't recall Jesus snapping his fingers.
@ranaantionette @NewsHour @MJGerson @JudyWoodruff My brother is a Psy.D. and this is real. He's been counseling patients for decades now.
@ranaantionette @NewsHour @MJGerson @JudyWoodruff No, he did not create them exactly as they are. The Fall. Kicked out of Garden of Eden, remember. We were created for that but sin. The cause of all the mental health issues, sin. You  address it by being saved from your sin. And not only you  individually but those in your life.
@washingtonpost Uh-huh. #ysos?
@thehill @HillTVLive Sure, The American Dream. "And all I wanted was bleu cheeses dressing." Worked for @amyklobuchar
@TODAYshow @Schreibernews He's a former Marine and reservist, and he was an acquisitions officer for the Coast Guard. You leave all that off. Also that he searched about an "illegal impeachment" of the president and seizing power for people like @Ilhan. I think these are salient details not in your spin.
@brandondarby His military experience PROBABLY saved his life! Now @RepSwalwell will start up his over-caffeinated tweets again. I would recommend pure leaf unsweetened tea.
@thehill See, @DickDurbin old white men have no place in @TheDemocrats. That's what @JoeCrowleyNY didn't get. Why don't you act like a man and publicly address the #genderquotas that are eliminating you from leadership???
@amyklobuchar Isn't big pharma like your biggest contributor after lawyers like #WalterMondale? @SenAmyKlobuchar
@JacobAWohl @gatewaypundit @realDonaldTrump @JussieSmollett Possible overreach by @donlemon
@thehill Too much caffeine?
@markknoller @POTUS @SecPompeo I would not willingly share with these anti-American folks, like @Ilhan ANYTHING about these negotiations. And the  #fakenews like @maggieNYT are going to have to learn to understand we do not PLAY with them and national security. @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN @MinnesotaDFL
@politico Maybe this is why @KamalaHarris has such a bad attitude toward @realDonaldTrump. She has a dad named Donald J Harris who disapproves of her lifestyle. Not presidential material @SenKamalaHarris
@davidaxelrod So you are suggesting @Chicago_Police dedicated too much time to this? Justify your accusation @davidaxelrod
@RepBonnie @BennieGThompson Trump is not a "racist". Maybe YOU might want to sit it out.
@thehill Actually he was a Marine and reservist who recently joined @uscoastguard as acquisitions officer. He was studying what he believed was imminent possibility that these people would "illegally impeach" the president and seize power. You want to overthrow government, correct?
@nytopinion @nytimes @neal_katyal Opinion writer is @neal_katyal, a very interested by-stander who often engages in trying to forcefully remove the elected @POTUS as a fund-raising technique for the @BarackObama @BillClinton and @algore. You can believe EVERY WORD he writes. @amyklobuchar
@ByronYork Probablty @BarackObama will have a lot of  twerking girls, though, just to keep his confidence up.
@thehill Well, you have to give @TuckerCarlson credit for sincerity. I don't know what the dispute was all about since I don't have cable. I guess I'll check it out on youtube
@CharlieDeMar @HotlineJosh Maybe they'll try a version of the @therealroseanne solution to ease in another program. I've never watched it so I can't offer ideas.
@TheDemocrats It's not fake. You're #FakeDemocrats
@davidfrum It appears to me this guy was a military person motivated by his idea of an imminent overthrow of the U.S. government for cheap politics. Of course I know you SUPPORT the forceful overthrow of the government, Frum. @amyklobuchar #fakenews #TrumpTrain
@davidfrum I'm reminded you're not an American. This is, of course, a very difficult time for Americans because of an illegal impeachment coup which you make $$$ supporting. You claim "solidarity"? More important to get people to follow Constitution, not your cheap politics @amyklobuchar
@davidaxelrod is upset because that's HIS business and @JussieSmollett got into his space. MANY "oppressed" minorities and homosexuals, and above all, women, exploit their identity for political ambition. Instead of just being themselves. Like @amyklobuchar #genderquota queen. https://t.co/fbUPIPd6Dj
@davidfrum A noose is a weapon. Maybe they did not teach you that in Canada.
@davidfrum Well, @JussieSmollett was a TV personality who made a lot of public statements, the other was very secretive. But I guess you can't figure that out, David.
@thehill They'll have to shut down the whole show.
@politico I think Jeff Sessions move was stupid. Was he one of the leaders notified by #AndrewMcCabe that he was targeting @realDonaldTrump? So he should have refused the entire job as Trump said.
@NRO @JohnsonHildy I assume the U.S. is already targeted, isn't that so? So why do you mislead?
@WSJ Why should a Russian collective farm "have been wiped out"? Why do you even post garbage like this? You're weaponizing food. Why people don't like Wall Street.
@WSJ I believe the big competitors were Brazil and Argentina, not Russia. You said sold more soybeans.. You say "nearly wiped out"? I'll want to see your numbers and sources. Food should be fast-tracked with China @SecretarySonny @POTUS
So I tracked the service and filing of the #breastcancer #MABC Minnesota case on cancellation of cancer treatment coverage funded by Congress and Legislature handled by @AGEllison. Was timely delivered by @usps, waiting for certified sign by @MNCourts timely. Govt 30 days 2 rspnd https://t.co/Kn4AJG1hvb
@NRO @JonahNRO Jonah you're uh, not too bright. 'Act of Weakness"? So according to you bright eyes it's "weakness" to have a border? Sure you can't explain that.
@bpolitics Right. Except @realDonaldTrump doesn't have any "polarizing rhetoric on race" and it's dishonest of your publication to assert he does.
@AaronBlake So somehow this is funny to you, Aaron? Which one doesn't @seanhannity do?
@ranaantionette @NewsHour @MJGerson @JudyWoodruff Again, not Biblical. Since God created you as a perfect whole. Not variable between individuals. Hence education the leading out (e ducere) of you. But you don't actually believe in Creation do you? And I don't know why. It's offensive to so many. Hence abortion on demand.
@NRO @KatTimpf It's the collagen
@CheriJacobus Lol
@MarkWarner You've disgraced the United States, Mark, degraded her dignity and majesty.
@KamalaHarris Seriously, @SenKamalaHarris did you hear @MichaelJMorell say @potus could not stop KJU because intel didn't know where his nuclear assets were? So why shouldn't @potus listen to a friend of NK who had better intel to see if he would attack the U.S. soil if he acted? ANSWER the qu
@TheDemocrats Here's @AGBecerra losing his mind.
@amyklobuchar That's what we keep the guns for, @SenAmyKlobuchar under the 2nd Amendment to make sure WE can protect the children. To enforce our laws. You would dismantle our laws. Like @SadiqKhan who wants to disarm the cops and ban knives too. Only bad guys, with guns, knives.
@rolandsmartin @SenSanders @BernieSanders So @rolandsmartin now says Americans SHOULD vote against white men per se, and SHOULD vote for black candidates based on the color of their skin. This shows how empty Roland's mind actually is. I guess it makes good television, does it make good television?
@amyklobuchar Well your little investigation will shut down next week @SenAmyKlobuchar you should be ASHAMED of having been associated. It degrades the majesty of the United States of America. You call into question the possibility of self-governance. @MinnesotaDFL
@gatewaypundit @LoriSwansonMN @RamseyCounty They admit to it. Just like @AGEllison and @LoriSwansonMN admit @RamseyCounty acted erroneously to injure the rights of a #breastcancer patient. They lost the case. https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A  #FightLikeAGirl
@MarkMazzettiNYT @maggieNYT Let's see you put your freedom ahead of my freedom as a voter and @potus freedom of speech, correct? And why is that? Because you're basically just a money-making operation.
@politico So he was attacking Bill Barr before?
@WSJ It's real. And there are even @UMNews law professors like @RWPUSA who attack the free speech of the Constitution and the #Election2016. Prof. Painter imagines that the @MinnesotaDFL is a democratic organization, well, he's a Republican and never really understood the caps.
@Newsweek Well, then would @Judgenap also say it was attempt to obstruct justice to replace Jeff Sessions with William Barr?
@PhillyInquirer Then @agkeithellison @GovTimWalz and @TonyLourey should not be allowed to seize the #breastcancer treatment coverage of Minnesota still in treatment or to impose a massive spenddown forcing her and her spouse down to 80% of the poverty level qualifying for cash assistance. #ap
@thehill There should not a #RobertMueller report. It was a hoax from the beginning. It insults the dignity and majesty of the United States of America and its Republic and Constitution. @amyklobuchar
@thestate As far as a "freeze" for @UMNews it's not enough as I told the former @PrezKaler
@theblaze I think that's fine: The LGBTQ board can organize their own tournaments. And watch them themselves.
@Newsweek He has no standing for this. And this is not a proper action for a class action read Rule 23,
@politico @LamarAlexander let's review. @POTUS could have got #TheWall built over a longer period of time. The reason he is not is because it IS an emergency. NO contradiction here. I would not overrule him. You think it's NOT an emergency? So explain why.
@vermontgmg @hughhewitt No, I think Barr said he's in charge, he knows #robertmueller has had so much time he's becoming ridiculous and  it's time to wrap it up @amyklobuchar @MinnesotaDFL
@thehill ALL identity politicians are too self-absorbed to govern a free society. Essentially they are saying they are NOT free. They need to discover their freedom and choose a society that respects liberty, not deny liberty for self-interest.
@thehill "Fact checker" is #fakenews
@NRO @DavidAFrench So in other words you're saying there's a silent majority.
@ranaantionette @NewsHour @MJGerson @JudyWoodruff The real concern here is not whether a Biblical approach is sufficient. You can argue that. The real concern is there appear to be so many problems, including depression that can't be cured in a large number of cases by the secular approach. It becomes secular sour grapes.
@ranaantionette @NewsHour @MJGerson @JudyWoodruff I'm sure that's a disciplinary point of contention. But your position is unbiblical. I think as you say TB and mental health are fundamentally different. You'd have to put forth an entire secular scheme to define the discipline and so forth. Also your "any religion" is unbiblical
@SenKevinCramer @robport @POTUS But this is NOT socialism. Land-grant universities--https://t.co/7DD9UePgTB
@MikeWishnie @YaleLawSch @YLS_ROLC @NAACP @NAACPCT So here, @keithellison the organization is trying to concentrate black voters so as prisoners they won't lose their vote, as states agree to let them vote in prison as was done in the @RoyMooreSenate Alabama election. Do better.
@kpolantz @CNNPolitics Ok
@Paula_White A good word. @MNCourts think of the hundreds of Minnesota women who are being cavalierly tossed out of the #breastcancer treatment by cancelling their #MABC during treatment. Come on now, @AGEllison @votejohnchoi!
@PennyEMN @umncla So? Underemployed graduates, so what? What does that even mean? You can't create good jobs any more than the government can--which you are.
@UMNews @umncla @UMNEnglish Run-on.
@Change2Win @Teamsters @fightfor15 Built-in inflation.
So is Vietnam in this summit too? @SecPompeo https://t.co/uSELV3DZ0l
@RWPUSA Uh you mean @Ilhan and @GovMarkDayton?
@korytellers @EducationMN @irvspanish @AndyLeiser @jenhegna @ByronSup531 @MrMur_ray @RyanRadke316 @GustafsonBrad Free tuition? @GovTimWalz @peggyflanagan
@RWPUSA As a law professor at @UMNews you MUST know about MNConst.UofMCharter Sec. 12. The admission fee to the University and the charges for tuition...shall be without charge to all students" right? I mean you teach law at the school, you MUST know its Charter correct?
@JoyAnnReid @politico Oh OF COURSE! The loons are already crying "foreign state actors" in #Election2020 smh
@JohnCroman @andrewwagner @NickZerwas Interesting idea. Increase over what? Are there presently such penalties for reporting hate crimes as such or just false reports?
@mitchpberg Mitch Berg is on @Twitter! And a very insightful tweet too. So the news is the #RobertMueller follies will end.
@davidfrum It's not Stalinist. However, as a Canadian you wouldn't understand that. Mr. "Atlantic".
@tictoc @AGSNYT my right to vote is MORE than equal to your press freedoms. You are undermining our democracy, why can't you understand that? Yes, you're more than failing, you will be replaced by #SocialMedia voters. I no longer read your paper, which I read for 30 years, as @umncla too
@WalshFreedom @nytimes Joe, don't call @realDonaldTrump "un-American &amp; dangerous". So "the people" in THIS country is our Constitution and ourelections. @nytimes needs to ACCEPT the election results and  stop undermining elections. See MY right as a voter is EQUAL to the press freedom of #fakenews
@NBCNews Yeah, they wielded it with propaganda machines like @nytimes #FakeNews
@KlobsSpaceForce #bot claims to be "Snow Angel"
@Morning_Joe It appears @DickDurbin @SenatorDurbin @JoeNBC are already fighting investigation of the information brought forward by #AndrewMcCabe. What do they have to hide? @amyklobuchar this will make your campaign look VERY bad! @SenAmyKlobuchar
@heatherscope @scottwongDC Ask the FEC. I think this is a way of filing and raising funds reported to the FEC. I don't know what happens to the funds if they don't run. Maybe they can still use them.
@jguynn @USATODAY So is your point that this same behavior against the students should have happened, but America should never had known about it?
@adamliptak Good. Is that the one they tweeted this morning?
@ashtonpittman @rolandsmartin @amyklobuchar knows ZILCH about economics. But she indicates she is running as a #socialist. @SenAmyKlobuchar @MinnesotaDFL She has NEVER protected liberty, NEVER protected the free market. And she doesn't get it that she doesn't protect the Constitution.
@BostonGlobe @omgal Spinach.
@NYDailyNews You're #fakenews throwing around the word "retaliate". The word would be "respond". "Retaliate" means they would use their weapons. #ysos?
@repjocasta @IronStache Just the point. There IS no debate because of the idiot #fakenews media. Sure, individuals can debate, @realDonaldTrump can use @twitter. But the mass of the people only hear what #fakenewsmedia feeds them. They ARE the enemy of the people attempting to nullify #Election2016
@esglaude @rolandsmartin "Beaten"? What do you mean "beaten"? Pretty crazy charges you're leveling there.
@TheView @ThisWeekABC @TulsiGabbard AGAIN, @amyklobuchar is denying free tuition under Minnesota Constitution. Article XIII, Section 3. Sec. 12. The admission fee to the University and the charges for tuition... shall be without charge to all students https://t.co/7DD9UePgTB
@JoshDorner @creynoldsnc Really? I have no doubt in my mind that @splcenter would classify the U.S. Congress and every state government as "white national groups" and "hate groups".
@thehill So what, @JoeBiden? Say something important, not mocking.
@cspanwj @RosenJeffrey So the alien and sedition acts were concerned with non-sudden threats from foreign countries. They were a response to a perceived emergency. I'm not advocating for the acts, but they had the same Constitutional basis--an ONGOING threat.
@cspanwj @RosenJeffrey Uh-huh. "Sudden attacks"? Show me.
@ranaantionette @NewsHour @MJGerson @JudyWoodruff Anyone can become a true Christian, and it is not a philosophical/religious approach  to mental health. Eating healthy is medication, rest is medication, but the Truth will set you free. Truly.
@WashTimes Good. I ignore them.
@KlobsSpaceForce @amyklobuchar who accuses @realDonaldTrump of being a Russian bot agent, has her own #KlobBots. And openly threatens @twitter and @facebook. smh
@KlobsSpaceForce @realDonaldTrump does not express racism, @amyklobuchar. When I was as @umncla @SenAmyKlobuchar showed up as I was working with Chicano students getting involved in the government. She helped racist students ridicule us. They had founded the Chicano Studies Department year before
I advocate passing a federal statute providing a land grant to southern border states including a wall, but also for the  purposes of a land-grant university, with plenty of new teaching jobs, in Spanish and English and with international students from Mexico to build border. #ap
@JohnFromCranber This is what @amyklobuchar OPENLY backs.
@scottwongDC Yeah, right.
@KatyTurNBC @SavannahGuthrie should have gotten all eight names. @senatemajldr? I need to know.
@KatyTurNBC Who cares if "no one objected"? How is that relevant? I just want their names an positions. @tedlieu
@GovTimWalz Oh, I like that, community prosperity. I'm sure you can fit transportation into that one. Now, where is that in your budget? So is the budget available on-line?
@jdawsey1 It's all #fakenews just like you @tedlieu
@QuickenLoans There he is, the Cheshire Cat.
@BrookingsInst No one doubts that, including @potus. With LEGAL immigration.
@BernieSanders @BWestbrookAZ8 Bernie goes and proves @realDonaldTrump point immediately.
@AngelaDavisMPR @MPRnews You can't educate me if you're not educated. Sorry, I know @MPRnews picked you out for this item for some reason....Wasn't because you're educated.
@AngelaDavisMPR @MPRnews They haven't been written yet. We need to write them. That's why @umncla passed a Cultural Pluralism Requirement. They're supposed to WRITE THE BOOKS. I saw Guillermo Rojas late chair of Chicano Studies Department did write one, I have one here somewhere. You're uneducated sorry.
@foxnewsradio @realDonaldTrump Say, @POTUS speaks for a HUGE number of Americans. We're tweeting as well. and so are you.
@HouseDemocrats You mean paved the way toward Reconstruction. Just like @Ilhan with her Jihad Reconstruction, aided by foolish @MinnesotaDFL @GovMarkDayton, Revels did not actually represent Mississippi. We need to move beyond race and back to One America.
@WalshFreedom Every news source has bias, but all news doesn't have bias. You need to separate the material facts from the news. That's called editing. @bllyrush
@jonallendc Oh, now it's 'in crosshairs". Isn't that kind of a LIE, sir?
@Ilhan It's not your state. You're a phony, a product of unconstitutional @MinnesotaDFL and @dnc gender and race quotas and an arrogant rich boy governor. Who gets a D-. @GovMarkDayton @StarTribune
@larryrjacobs Too bad, Larry, that that is not how the decision is being made. Obviously with your vaunted #fakenews friends, public opinion can be swayed. Your "majorities" are either rabid partisans or people who don't know, or care about the operation of border security. @amyklobuchar #kstp
@AHMalcolm https://t.co/7DD9UePgTB Socialism is not necessary for free higher education. @amyklobuchar ignores the Minnesota Constitution Article XIII, Section 3., Sec. 12. "admission fee to the University and the charges for tuition...shall be without charge" @SenSanders @mndailynews #ap
@nato812 @hughhewitt @SenateJudiciary @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @SenFeinstein I see he is at a part-time law school in California, but I still don't know I can rely on him to say @POTUS is "losing cases" in CA because some district judges or a #9thcir vacancy hasn't been filled. As for "negotiating" with @SenFeinstein she's a partisan hack. So trade cases?
@nato812 @hughhewitt @SenateJudiciary @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @SenFeinstein So, the cases that were lost then? He doesn't seem to be referring to any specific cases. Or don't law professors have to do that?
@ron_fournier It's not obstruction, Ron.
@ron_fournier Oh, so you mean losing money?
@hughhewitt @SenateJudiciary @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @SenFeinstein Do you have any definite idea of why these cases were "lost", Hugh or are you just extrapolating from politics? I mean shouldn't we actually LOOK at the cases?
@hughhewitt @SenateJudiciary @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @SenFeinstein So Hugh Hewitt legal expert?
@RickSantorum @pegasuskentucky @Heritage @GovMattBevin Don't forget to #FightLikeAGirl against #breastcancer in low-income women. https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A #AllLivesMatter
@bobdavis187 @TradeNewsCentre We want to get this right. It is important that we fast track farm products, though, because food should never be used as a weapon or for leverage. @MNFarmfest @SecretarySonny @POTUS @stevenmnuchin1
So bear in mind @keithellison @AGEllison that this is @SpeakerPelosi who is arguing to @USSupremeCourt (in some district court) that she has "standing" to sue @POTUS over his actions @RWPUSA that are authorized under law, claiming separation of powers @amyklobuchar. https://t.co/ULCFAMjWyV
@GovMikeHuckabee #WWCTD?
@Newsweek Thank you Dr. Spock @BarackObama
@Newsweek @RWPMinnesota is an embarrassment to @UMNews. It's amazing that @POTUS can be so effective during #RobertMueller coup against #Election2016 benighted @DNC with rogue intel like @Comey and DISLOYAL folks like @amyklobuchar @HillaryClinton @BarackObama have carried out.
@CNNEE How does a group of states even have standing to order executive branch what to do? He's acting under the laws of the United States!
@BillKristol @JoeNBC @marcthiessen Another idiotic column. So what is your constitutional case @marcthiessen? "Separation of powers"? Idiotic, sir. So you would seek to use the third branch (@HouseFloor is NOT a separate branch) to aid @HouseDemocrats against the executive?
@Newsweek Again, U.S. "intel expert" @MichaelJMorell while the NK missiles were still flying, told Sunday news shows our intelligence was incapable of telling us where nuke sites WERE. So how could they have advised @potus of capability to hit U.S.??? This person is no  "expert".
@ron_fournier Not an indictment at all. @amyklobuchar. You can't even see you're undermining #Election2016 can you? smh
@Newsweek What a great kid @CovingtonCatho2
@BostonGlobe This man is the worst. #RodRosenstein is the height of arrogance and irresponsibility emerging from the dark days of @BarackObama and the TRAGIC mistake of racial and gender quotas that produced the likes of @amyklobuchar, a failed @Hennepin prosecutor. Because #WalterMondale
@ron_fournier Mathematical mistake @ChadLivengood that can't be excused because of the beer.
This means a lot of Venezuelans have left the country. https://t.co/0eLvQwnxxd
@bpolitics Luke 1:17, @Pontifex_es
@CNNEE Read Luke 1:17, @Pontifex. I think most priests are not parents (I read there are exceptions, and "fatherless" children of priests). But John the Baptist was unexpectedly conceived by Zacharias and Elizabeth and the Angel said he would turn parents hearts back to their children.
@ranaantionette @NewsHour @MJGerson @JudyWoodruff I'm a Christian. No one can avoid the effects of having been born into sin, and part of that is being less than happy, apparently for no reason at all, when compared to what blessings God and Jesus Christ have bestowed on us and our civilization. It's a kind of path there for you
@ranaantionette @NewsHour @MJGerson @JudyWoodruff Nor am I clear that depression itself can be sorted out from a host of conditions identified by practitioners of let's call it psychotherapy. Such as manic-depression. Also, SAD (seasonal affective disorder). The response to shorter days and less sunlight.
I don't know if Nauert would have been good or not, I accept the expertise of @potus in his selection. But I think if the woman who worked for her was in the country legally, it's kind of ridiculous she couldn't work. @amyklobuchar https://t.co/VMrFJNTir1
@TomPerez @TheDemocrats Do you have anything sensible to say about @realDonaldTrump, Tom? Because I have yet to hear it. We should work WITH @potus.
@_waleedshahid @vets4bernie Yeah, it ain't white boys day, @JoeCrowleyNY. Why won't any of you "men" announce that the women have an unconstitutional gender cap on you? You betray our freedom.
@theblaze Yes, @kirstenpowers blocks me. Suppose I should be proud of that. Can't remember why. Probably suppresses dissent.
@theblaze I remember arguing with her on @twitter that day. I was right, she was wrong. @KirstenPowers. Looks like she blocks me.
@amyklobuchar My idiot rival thinks this is "obstruction"....Hey, Amy! It is a hoax. You going to charge me with obstruction too??
@NYDailyNews Not the same billboards though...
@thehill Probably an @amyklobuchar supporter. I hear they like to grab a whole bowl of ranch dressing and eat it like a bowl of soup.
@adamgoldmanNYT @PhilipRucker @nytimes You're idiots. History will note that you were the #fakenews during this assault on our democracy and it was a reason we burned your #fakenews. Still too daft to realize you're attempting to aid a coup. Against MY VOTE. And you think you're cool. @amyklobuchar
@stranahan @YouTube Totally different use of guitar. Much bigger environment.
@thehill I might agree with you on that.
@washingtonpost Their coverage is TERRIBLE. We still don't know what happened. Why was it so important for someone to kill him? Let's start with that, award winners.
@creynoldsnc @danpfeiffer @TheDemocrats like me ARE engaged, but not enraged. We don't want to stop the @realDonaldTrump progress. @MinnesotaDFL like @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN mindlessly follow @SenSchumer...
@ReaganBattalion @LizMair @BernieSanders Well, he's independent, that's for sure.
@washingtonpost #WWCTD? What would Clarence Thomas do?
@WalshFreedom @KellyannePolls @CNN She's a LOT smarter than you are Joe.
@SenKamalaHarris A series of laws known collectively as the Alien and Sedition Acts were passed by the Federalist Congress in 1798 and signed into law by President Adams. These laws included new powers to deport foreigners as well as making it harder for new immigrants to vote. Not racism.
@NewsHour @MJGerson @JudyWoodruff But is it a "disease"? Isn't it possible it is a natural response to certain circumstances? Sure it requires an awareness of a condition and steps to abandon it. But medicating isn't the answer, like TB.
@SlenderSherbet You know what's scary, is people who just sit and watch this video over and over. Keeps 'em off the streets though.
@tedlieu So if you go back to the Alien and Sedition Act the same thing happened. Except it was French, not Japanese. It was NOT racial. It takes intentionality to define what America and the Constitution is. Not cheap political correctness and attacking America.
@tedlieu Actually, Ted the Constitution actually worked in that case. Japanese subs were attacking. It was war. If it happens again, we'll face the same issues. Let's not have it happen again, okay? Didn't the Japanese also attack your people? Or wasn't that "racist"?
@NBCNews Is this woman hispanic?
@NBCNews Sure, we could all be speaking French or Spanish, and that is real. Perhaps @NBCLatino is not educated, but we had DeLaSalle out here proclaiming that this all belongs to the Sun King. So I want to ask "enlightened" @NBCNews DO YOU KNOW THAT? What do you think of it?
@NBCNews Well I can understand what she's saying. Out here in Minnesota we got @Ilhan who feels she's discriminated against if she can't pretend to represent CD5 and tell Israel Americans think they're all evil. Just waltzes in and takes over, because @GovMarkDayton. Who's NOT America 1st
@ChrisCoons So Chris is "stunned". Seriously, Chris? Do you REMEMBER, please @MichaelJMorell on TV saying OUR INTEL agencies don't know where NK nukes are even located? Do you REMEMBER that? So can they hit the U.S.? Well, "we don't know" do we? Wake up and be for real, sir. Mr. Senate "god"
@selectedwisdom Hurts being a loser, doesn't it Clint? You proud of your boy #AndrewMcCabe out there now? Did you know about this @fbi attack on #Election2016? Bet you did, too. Admit it.
@washingtonpost Racism is NOT a serious problem now. Go ahead and participate. Don't pretend everyone should stop living because you imagine everybody's "racist." They're not.
@amyklobuchar @amyklobuchar is a legend in her own mind, "discovering" these great truths and thinks that should make her president. LOL
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump More #StupidTalk from @SenSchumer. The progress, Chuck is that now we have a @POTUS to is engaging instead of flounding like you and your buddy @BarackObama worst president.
@TheDemocrats You traitors to the Constitution ARE the emergency and you will NOT prevail. We WILL fight you.
@RepAdamSchiff Adam's losing his mind and thinks it's relevatory "legal" thinking. Get over it, @RepAdamSchiff you and @HillaryClinton LOST and that's a GOOD thing.
@amyklobuchar @keithellison You're attempting to use one branch, the judiciary to aid @TheDemocrats in the @HouseFloor to control another branch the Executive. @USSupremeCourt will tell you you have to WIN #Election2016 to attempt this, NOT seek the aid of the courts. @POTUS
@amyklobuchar @keithellison Further I heard your "argument" Keith. So you're not commander in chief and YOU judge the resources are not well-used protecting our border. That is still a purely political argument, won't make it for you, but it's NOT separation of powers. It's attempting to use @USSupremeCourt
@amyklobuchar @keithellison This is not "leadership" @SenAmyKlobuchar @keithellison @MinnesotaDFL Leadership will be if YOU stop killing Minnesota women with #breastcancer IN TREATMENT by cancelling health insurance YOU CONTROL now, Keith. Remember? "Fighter" for the people? Earth to Keith, Earth to Keith!
@dandrezner The only  thing "weak" Dan is your decrepit mind. So you think it's real cool to interfere with and seek to nullify #Election2016
@PhillyInquirer "Gentrification" means removing folks from their neighborhoods by a kind of creative destruction. We can do better.
@PhillyInquirer Oh, but it's black gentrification, so that's cool then, right? I'm not so sure gentrification IS cool because it's a form of ethnic cleansing. What happens to the people?
@JChengWSJ @jimmyalto A new trend has begun. Yes, I think Vietnam might think it will be nice if North Korea does not nuclearize the region, long torn by strife. @potus @vp @MinnesotaDFL @washingtonpost @wsj @nytimes
And my mother let me read a Greek interlinear New Testament and I opened it up and read, @amyklobuchar. It opened to the Book of Luke, and I read from the beginning. At 1:17 the Angel says of John "he shall turn the hearts of the parents to their children." Abortions will stop.
So it came to pass in the days of @amyklobuchar trying to be president and #AndrewMcCabe overthrowing the #Election2016 that we filed our #appellantbrief with @MNCourts. And I picked up a $1 copy of a tribute to @BillyGraham and was learning about his work.
@interactivemary @amyklobuchar will be happy to know we got our #AppellantBrief filed in #MABC #breastcancer case with Mn Ct of Appeals. You'll be receiving it tomorrow @votejohnchoi and @agellison. Hope to hear from you soon that you #SaveLives
@scottwongDC This is why @USSupremeCourt should revisit #sullivanvNYT because they willfully lie seriously. Agree with #ClarenceThomas @SteveKingIA
@LarryBoyer Kill your job
@bbierschbach @GovTimWalz I have no problem with Minnesota leading. However, you have been in Washington and the 22 trillion debt (not counting future interest) is out of control. You need to confront those in your party like @amyklobuchar who are spendthrift and irresponsible. THEN lead MN
@HillaryClinton Real national emergency @HillaryClinton and @TheDemocrats and #fakenews treachery.
@LauraAJarrett @SavannahGuthrie 'Bye @SpeakerRyan don't let the screen door hit you on the  butt on the way out! Disloyal to our COUNTRY! How dare you?
So I just reviewed this because @SenAmyKlobuchar made a big mistake, she adopted @HillaryClinton's dumb idea that we can't have free tuition. She doesn't know what she's talking about, I do. I have the experience. Watch this: Yes you can https://t.co/7DD9UePgTB @UMNews Serious
@mitchellreports @kasie Here's the longer version, that was for MY prez campaign for 2016. Which I am happy to say produced @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/7DD9UePgTB @amyklobuchar
@mitchellreports @kasie I ran against her (while they were attacking my wife's #breastcancer coverage, 'cause government). @amyklobuchar defies the Minnesota Const. which DOES provide for free tuition at @UMNews. https://t.co/JCTXvdHDSL
I am glad that @SpeakerRyan is GONE, because he aided an attempted coup against OUR elected government.
Hey goofball #AndrewMcCabe you are undermining MY election rights. You put yourself above our Constituiton. You S.O.B.
We need to remove disloyal @fbi people like Andrew McCabe. And the #FakeNews is largely responsible, helping their candidate @HillaryClinton and anti-American @BarackObama who nearly destroyed this country. Because race. @amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar
So let's go back @FBI: @MichaelJMorell @CIA was saying on naitonal TV we didn't  know where NK sites were! Your GREAT "intel"! Stop being stupid. @POTUS is an intelligent man, elected prez. Show some respect! Stand your ass down. @amyklobuchar
I'll tell you straight up again, @FBI the @POTUS had to determine whether NK nukes could reach us. Don't care about your EGO. So Putin sources would be something he would want to look at and compare. @BarackObama left us with missiles being fired over our ALLIES. @amyklobuchar
@postpolitics I would just like to point out to @washingtonpost that the United States is a MULTI-racial country. It's NOT black and white, and it's not blacks and everybody else against the whites either.
@Eugene_Robinson @Morning_Joe America has always thought big, duh.
@CBSNews He should be under arrest. #RodRosenstein
Yep! @amyklobuchar is running on it, that's all she's got. https://t.co/kHnHCU2KkS
@jdistaso @BernieSanders @WMUR9 Look out @amyklobuchar! @SenSanders is taking over @CNN!
@BostonGlobe @GlobeOpinion They should analyze the @BostonGlobe
@keithellison @AGEllison new lawyers, I'll see if THEY can https://t.co/rXs9gUAOS8 #FightLikeAGirl It's a health care thing, Amy wouldn't understand it. Good thing I worked at @AmericanCancer, saved lives. #WaronCancer @interactivemary ran away....@amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar
@InteractiveMary @amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar Typical #amyklobuchar2020 supporter. Everybody's "ignorant" except her and her multitudinous co-sponsors. It's call leading from behind. Which I believe #AmyKlobuchar is right now, she's behind right? But likes #cnn smh.
@InteractiveMary @amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar Appellant brief due today to @MNCourts. #fightlikeagirl. https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A
@InteractiveMary @amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar It's called DEBATE, and free speech. It's an American thing, you wouldn't understand.
Hey, @amyklobuchar! I believe in America First right now. You don't, you are undermining America. Because you're oppressed, of course, and need #genderquotas to prop you up, even if you have to push abortion on demand to do it. https://t.co/uiOJcW7LLG
@CNNPolitics So what is wrong with @Twitter? How did #WalterMondale govern, @amyklobuchar? By adopting Lyndon Johnson's "Great New Society". Then losing a lot of elections.
@CNN Yeah, heartland on the Canadian border. And the outer edges of suburbia, New Hope and Wayzata, wow.
@CNN And the Constitutional argument is WHAT, Amy? You're a lawyer @SenAmyKlobuchar tell the legal argument instead of just trying to grab the issue, OK? You are wrong.
@CNN So all Parisians should vote for her. Oh, except those #YellowJackets. So @amyklobuchar wants to do to the United States what Marcon is doing to France. What we NEED to do is market-driven technological change. You, know, science. STEM. Guess she missed that class.
@CNN Don't hate America, @amyklobuchar
So @amyklobuchar to me the answer would start with, well, what is black America's agenda? And it goes back a long way and it's not economics, because as @TheJuanWilliams said to me "we have been chattel." It's liberty, it's freedom, it's opportunity. It's America, contributing. https://t.co/BQbQl91Jdr
@CNN Yeah, trash your dad.
@amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar the beacon of  #genderquotas.
@amyklobuchar The majority of Americans aren't legislators, @SenAmyKlobuchar. You've been there since what, 2006 and you still can't discuss specific legislation?
@amyklobuchar Trump IS the opportunity! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Work with him! You got in the @USSenate because you're a woman, @SenAmyKlobuchar. You renounce PACs, because you don't need the $$$. Will you renounce #genderquotas?
So she co-sponsors a lot of bills? So what? Rarely votes against @SenateDems, so what? How about some actual leadership? On tough issues? Nothing except pushing for abortions to be popular with unmarried women. Oh, and knocking @POTUS for no good  reason. https://t.co/SJ9HOn1zGV
Want a masterful snowjob? Here you go! https://t.co/tx2YFSnjZC
@SenAmyKlobuchar homegrown? Did you ever HEAR of #genderquotas? Do you KNOW what they are? Have you ever read the @dnc or @MinnesotaDFL Constitution? Ever read the 19th Am.? Read it! She's #QuotaGrown 100%! https://t.co/tx2YFSnjZC
@jeffzeleny Great. And I have one word for @amyklobuchar too. No. But on free tuition, leae it to @amyklobuchar to oppose the Minnesota Constitution, which TODAY calls for free tuition. https://t.co/7DD9UePgTB @mndailynews
What that's called, @amyklobuchar is a moral hazard. Of course a lawyer wouldn't know what that is, it's like a fish out of water. It's when you hook in the drug companies to treat the people they addicted. With new drugs no doubt. https://t.co/SV0UEkyMxh
Uh-huh. Like #ObamaCare, right? Isn't that right @NewbergerJim? How many times did your opponent vote for ObamaCare? So she's been there since what 2006? "Something that will work right now." Well, that something is NOT @amyklobuchar. @POTUS https://t.co/r5JBgqGWc2
@nytpolitics More important, they're not enforcing right to #BCCPTA. https://t.co/rXs9gUAOS8
@joelpollak @amyklobuchar Yeah, she's a real scientist.
@KThomasDC @amyklobuchar She's supposed to be a lawyer. Where is her legal argument? I'm waiting.
@rolandsmartin @RepMaxineWaters This woman is nuts.
@thehill Where is it he should be for this? See how stupid the joke is? But for you to repeat it as a "joke" is far more stupid.l
@rolandsmartin @RepMaxineWaters Guffaw.
@Newsweek @JeffreyToobin is a disgrace.
@thehill @potus, I believe Hugo Black got this wrong in the @USSupremeCourt case citing #1stAm right to refuse to participate. This will obviously be a growing problem when we place Members of Congress who also disrespect our naiton.
@Newsweek Yes, @SenAmyKlobuchar was really tough on #KirbyPuckett. Yet, she said do nothing at @Hennepin about a gang-rape by 12 @GopherSports footplayers of a student at a "party". She can't be trusted to enforce simple criminal statutes. @MeghanMcCain
@reviewjournal Wait, for those who are using, it says what? "Would not prevent employers from requiring that employees not..."
@robbystarbuck @PrisonPlanet @TMZ Right, two Nigerians screaming "This is Donald Trump country"! That's likely.
@jlthundersnow @HurdOnTheHill @POTUS Same as the New York border.
@peterbakernyt @maggieNYT YOU are unacceptable. And I say this as a journalist.
@peterbakernyt @dandrezner To be clear Peter. You ae not an enemy of Mr. Trump. You are an enemy of US, the honest Americans who want people to report NEWS, not be the political national enquirer like you are.
@shoshido @KurtSchlichter To make a statement like that @jeffreygoldberg means that you are a threat. You simply talk too much.
@JuddLegum @JoyAnnReid We know. You folks are haters and liars. NO credibility for your #fakenews.
@SebGorka Not just McCabe. There is corroboration.
@TommyHicksGOP @SebGorka There is corroboration.
@thehill @SenSherrodBrown you helped people in 2000 when as a Rep. you supported the passage of the #BCCPTA. To save lives of low-income women screened with the cancer. BUTI haven't heard a word from you as Minnesota, maybe Ohio too, cancel policies baselessly. https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A
@BeschlossDC I study them all the time so I don't need a special day.
@thehill Well, but we don't know what intel Putin had. YOu should always consider whether someone closer to another country has some better information. WHAT is wrong with McCabe? Are these people STUPID? I worked in intel enough to know that you don't always have perfect information.
@WashTimes Okay, @realDonaldTrump if this is true, remove him. #patrickshanahan.
@NRO @JohnsonHildy But #loopy @SpeakerPelosi thinks she 'won", she's a dominatrix, because she endangers the nation and our people. #RemoveNancy
@chicagotribune If that's what you think  black history is you're pathetic.
@thehill I'm pretty sure @limbaugh kicked #ChrisWallace butt here. I'll check it out sometime.
@davidhogg111 Some kids will say anything to get laid.
@ThisWeekABC LOL
@thehill So #ChrisWallace as watch your little tantrum on @FoxNewsSunday I see @StephenMiller told you EXACTLY what I just tweeted at you. #Congress gave @potus the authority specifically in the statute. You need to retire Chris and come out as the activist you are. smh
@thehill Okay, idiot #ChrisWallace. @StephenMiller just TOLD you Congress gave @potus the money through the 1976 national emergency act. That means he can use the money. You don't LISTEN, you line up your little questions and think that makes you God, you're ridiculous. @FoxNewsSunday #ap
@thehill So I'm coming the loon #ChrisWallace again without first listening to @StephenMiller who said about the #borderinvasion EXACTLY what I just tweeted. Now as far as the money from the treasury, that means it has to be drawn, but Congress doesn't decide how to defend the nation.
@thehill Dear #CrookedChris Wallace. MAYBE 80-90% of your drugs are seized at ports of entry because we have more operational control over those borders. MAYBE your @FoxNewsSunday analysis is just IGNORANT. Maybe as @HurdOnTheHill admits he doesn't have operational control over the border
@thehill NO, #ChrisWallace, let's start withTHIS. 1.6 million illegals were caught crossing the border in the year Trump won California for president, 2000, 1.6 illegals were CAUGHT at the southern border. Chris, how is THAT not an invasion. Just shut up and ANSWER this question.
@thehill Sorry, Chrissie #ChrisWallace that is NOT the "joy" of it. ANSWER. THE. QUESTION.
@JuddApatow @FoxNews Oh, please
@WalshFreedom How is that even relevant, Joe? Goofball. #ChrisWallace #alsogoofball.
@amyklobuchar Or. It's a snowjob a great one, by @SenAmyKlobuchar #fakesenator and #genderquota queen for a day!
@carloslcurbelo @scottwongDC @mattgaetz No, it's a matter of public record big insurance DID support and write ObamaCare. The problem is you were not informed. Why you lost.
@JessieJaneDuff @KurtSchlichter @amyklobuchar always looks so drab. @KamalaHarris
@postpolitics He didn't just "raise the possibility". More outright lying and dissembling from #fakenews @washingtonpost.
@FaceTheNation @HurdOnTheHill @margbrennan So, @potus, how many drugs have come across this man's border, where he admits, but is not concerned, that the U.S. has no operational control of the border. Does the @cia "expert" even know?
@FaceTheNation @HurdOnTheHill @margbrennan This man is an idiot. Explain, Will, how border patrol and other needed efforts to defend the border will someone invade this space but #TheWall won't. I'll wait to see the "explanation" somewhere.
@Newsweek He obviously can't shoot because he has NO technique.
@nytimes @david_marchese Well the bottom line is that @RealMegRyan is not really a lawyer. Her movies were interesting but so far from reality, and she's propping up egos of lawyers that are just vicious, unethical liars and pretending they're real cool. Cause of burnout. "Sweetheart lawyers" LOLOL
@thehill @RepAdamSchiff "support" for @KamalaHarris campaign will probably hurt her more than help, and shows desperation by @SenKamalaHarris
@thehill Don't think @RepAOC is going to be re-elected.
@nytpolitics @peterbakernyt @AmbassadorRice famously said the world would have to take it just like we did with Russia. But I'm looking at the tests and they are fired at test sites. Still a great concern, but they do not fire into other countries. Can you see the significant difference here?
@nytpolitics @peterbakernyt Okay, let's start with multiple firings of test missiles over our allies. Can you  be so stupid? What did you think was going to happen because of the utter incompetence of @BarackObama and @AmbassadorRice? Those were acts of war. @POTUS @VP
@politico I don't care about "outrage" from the @EUCouncil members as long as they  ACT. @realDonaldTrump is right. At least there needs to be an intelligent, JOINT decision what to do here. Let's have some leadership on this. @MunSecConf @SecPompeo
@FrankLuntz Bankruptcy is preferable to losing the farms, correct? They can reorganize and keep the farm going. @NewbergerJim
@GovTimWalz wants to restore Local Government Aid funding but didn't discuss where THAT is going to come from. He's all about funding government, growing the government. No discussion of fostering economic growth.
@GovTimWalz why can't we take transportation money from health care and education? Of course you can. And you need to address how revenue will increase as transportation is created and improved. Supply-side transportation.
@BostonGlobe Duh.
@thehill Isn't that OBVIOUS, Hill? Try to figure it out. @SenRonJohnson is correct because you needed that 60-vote limit for many important things. Majority doesn't cut it. Are you REALLY that dumb?
Now, @HurdOnTheHill and you are NOT the commander in chief, it's obviously how important the recent statements by @potus are about the record defense spending. Hurd is obviously wrong. Pretends to care we don't have operational control of the border. Step aside, sir.
So basically @HurdOnTheHill argument for stopping #TheWall is that the government needs to use land for the wall. So let's take his argument further. If @POTUS wants to do anything to stop the flow across this land, would he not need to UTILIZE that very same land? Obviously yes.
This moron @HurdOnTheHill says it's not a national emergency because it's been a problem since before Ronald Reagan. He basically makes a lot of arguments that actually support @potus. For instance, can't border patrol enough.
@ChrisCoons another lying politician who will defend his party undermining the Constititution to overthrow and imprison members of the opposite national party. I recall where his state tried to break off and create a new nation during the War with the British of 1812.
@amyklobuchar lied during her "re-election" campaign that she would support securing our border. Now she is running for president on her lie.
@HurdOnTheHill is not a "Republican". He is a black @cia tripper who somehow controls most of the Texas border with Mexico. I have long noted this.
@danpfeiffer Your little boy politics, Dan, was fun to you with #fakenews urging @BarackObama but he was the most dangerously anti-American president in our history, a regular Benedict Arnold.
@thehill Obviously true. We need to follow our Constitution yet @BarackObama has done his best to subvert it. #RodRosenstein etc. should be arrested.
@RodStryker @JVER1 @charliekirk11 @dbongino @RealSaavedra @RealCandaceO @Thomas1774Paine @michellemalkin @MikeTokes @DineshDSouza @Rambobiggs @TuckerCarlson Coming to Great America Again!
@MSNBC It's not false.
@BillKristol Hey Bill only an idiot sees an equivalence.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump He could have shut down the government you nitwit. You would prefer that because you're nuts enough to think that makes you a winner Nancy.
@SenSchumer Not the cops, though, @chuckschumer?
@TeamPelosi @SpeakerPelosi you loser, we will build the wall. You will lose your job because you're just leader of the #CrazyCongress built on #genderquotas and race and other voter quotas.  We'll defend the border despite you're being a traitor.
@TheDemocrats Oh, right "ineffective wall". You're anti-Americans, and I'm backing the @potus and you need to loosen your grip on democracy by your manipulation of the @dnc.
@amyklobuchar @SherrodBrown @SenAmyKlobuchar is a con artist. Her little friends in Minnesota don't follow the  federal law that prevents purges like @RamseyCountyD2 does. In #Election2016 when I was on the primary ballot these idiots purged me from the rolls, then wouldn't let me vote with my own license.
@AaronBlake Seems like @mattgaetz is not taking this situation too seriously. I don't accept his criticism, that some fool like @BarackObama could abuse his powers. Maybe he'll get the @CIA @FBI to ARREST his successor like he's some thug 3rd word dictator. @realDonaldTrump
@carolmswain @realDonaldTrump @AnnCoulter I'm not a cheerleader. However, @AnnCoulter is wrong. We need @POTUS to take the lead on this and he is doing a great job. Ann's problem is she believes her own headlines. She believes the #fakenews a reacts when they toy with her naive ideas. She's like their little puppet.
@RepAdamSchiff I think what he's saying, dumbo is that if you weren't crazy he could have worked with you to protect our border. #CrazyCongress
@TinaSmithMN Oh, so @ap you're saying #Congress has executive powers? @SpeakerPelosi claims the Constitution makes her equal to the @POTUS. Let's just call them #CrazyCongress.
@amyklobuchar I support the national emergency declaration @amyklobuchar. You have NO principles and never have. Just #AmyDearest. I will support @POTUS as he tries to secure the border. During  the election (I knew you were lying) you said you voted for this. Shameless #genderquota hack.
@davidaxelrod I don't think they're normal. But your issue is not valid. We need to respect the 2nd Am. And you have never shown why we should not.
Oh, THAT's why they put leashes on cats! https://t.co/Qr9P4zpMmo
Would you buy a used car from this woman? @angelamerkelcdu @amyklobuchar https://t.co/d5yjsEJXVC
@amyklobuchar Presidential candidate @SenAmyKlobuchar says on @Twitter that @potus declaring a national emergency will create an actual emergency. Man, that is HEAVY! Where did you party last night?
@davidrobertgrov Right @BarackObama has a little more flexibility after the election.
@bpolitics No he doesn't. Cut back on the caffeine.
@jemelehill @ron_fournier Looks like an insurance policy. So is he playing? Does he merit playing? I don't care, I'm boycotting anyway.
@NRO @jackrcrowe I take it @BenSasse would vote to repeal the act? It seems to me the law, which I have not yet read, simply codifies power that already exists in the executive. @potus
@BostonGlobe @GlobeOpinion #Gender as argument.
@BostonGlobe Nice bathrobe, though. Reminds me of @SpeakerPelosi holding court in the #CrazyCongress.
@ron_fournier Right, @hughhewitt: That @SpeakerPelosi and @amyklobuchar don't like border security, they're #OpenBorders. Therefore they deny the @POTUS has the power to defend our borders. They're relentless!
@pbump @CillizzaCNN Phil's come up with the #fakenews version of "people are saying." Only people AREN'T saying. We don't need you, we have #socialmedia. And no you're NOT editing.
@Newsweek She also thinks @alfranken is her friend. @POTUS
@amyklobuchar Gee, you've never supported @bluelivesmtr #BlueLivesMatter before. Why the sudden change, @amyklobuchar? Get new campaign advisers?
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Your nation? And you're part of the emergency. You think you're some kind of prima donna. Also RIDICULOUS charges. "Great violence"? You're an idiot.
@justinamash @scottwongDC Looks like pretty weak stuff, Justin. Goofball.
@MariaTCardona So you actually believe the @washingtonpost?
@SlenderSherbet @kathrynw5 Life is not fair.
@AnnCoulter Ann, I'm not stupid. The country does not on campaign promises. Obviously @potus is building a wall and defending the border. See if I were you I would keep up  on that and help him build the wall. This isn't about you, and actually not even about @realDonaldTrump. America First
@stranahan I'm a journalist too. See my profile.
This is to YOU, @amyklobuchar @MinnesotaDFL You are a despicable power-grabber, not surprising since you manipulated #genderquota voting cheating to get into office. https://t.co/P7XdEEX646
@HuffPost I won't learn civics from HuffPost
@thehill I disagree with you @AnnCoulter
@philipaklein Well, Philip why would you think @potus would need to win a lawsuit in order to act on a national emergency? Why would the courts tie a president's hand on a national emergency? Think.
@MariaTCardona @POTUS @thehill @realDonaldTrump did the right thing. Sorry you can't see that.
@NoahCRothman @HotlineJosh It doesn't mean that. He could have vetoed the spending bill. He did it because he BELIEVES it's a national emergency. That's his choice. @potus
@BennieGThompson There are people who believe the Civil War was a manufactured crisis as well. I don't give your judgment credibility because you're partisan and not thinking clearly.
@philipaklein Of course it's legal.
@GovofCO @ericmwalker @realDonaldTrump I sincerely hope you'revoted out govner. But maybe everybody's too stoned.
@postpolitics No he didn't goofballs. He COULD have refused to accept the bill, and VETOED it. I'm sure at this point you are so daft you wouldn't care. Why I NEVER read your stuff.
@RepAdamSchiff You, Adam, LITTLE @RepAdamSchiff are a big part of the emergency because you run your little party to attack our @potus and our southern border. The alternative is your little ratpack shutting down the government.
I would really like @johndickerson to shut his mouth while @potus is announcing the national emergency. #fakenews leeches off @realDonaldTrump but doesn't care AT ALL about the country. It was an accident it was on.
Why is it that #fakenews does not report this? @amyklobuchar? @TinaSmithMN? Why do you constantly lie and expect me to support you? https://t.co/T9LL32fa0Z
Amen. Although this is perhaps not the best language to reason with those who will not take seriously the responsibility of defending our country and its Constitution against #OpenBorders pushers like @SenTinaSmith and @amyklobuchar https://t.co/Zn9I6xNVzm
@amyklobuchar You need to be recalled from office. You are a liar who claimed in YOUR campaign that you already voted for this. And so did MANY of you dismal Dems. @TheDemocrats. You will not succeed in your #OpenBorders strategy. @POTUS @VP
@SenSchumer you're a goofy anti-American and I need to see you removed as @SenateDems leaders and I'm running against @SenTinaSmith on it.
@mschlapp @CPAC And #RodRosenstein.
These people need to be arrested, @amyklobuchar this is the kind of plot you're involved in while seeking to be prez. You totally lack judgment and none of your "experience" is of any worth. https://t.co/2pzwTrZFWo
@JonahNRO @dandrezner You're both morons. This is for adults.
@tvbrad @gatewaypundit @cbschicago Are they co-stars?
@thehill WHO is "Chris Stewart"??
@Newsweek You're backing an anti-American, @jaketapper
@Newsweek Hey funny man @jaketapper check this out: "Sheriff's departments often use six-point stars". Okay? You're ridiculing what now? @potus
@bpolitics The time works on all sides. And we remain the strongest economy, so people need to deal with us. I think he's pushing the important deals right now. @potus
@Newsweek @TheDemocrats think  you're funny. You're part of the problem and voting your butts out is a big part fo the solution. @potus is providing leadership, we need it.
@brandondarby @realDonaldTrump I could definitely see your point of view. If we start the wall and keep building it. With National Emergency we need direct leadership from @potus and @vp. Not just spending and bureaucracy. I need to see this.
@brandondarby @realDonaldTrump I trust him to make the best decision. I want to know more about the bill. I might not trust @senatemajldr on this, I need to look at the bill and see what McConnell did. Get @SpeakerPelosi out of there, she's propped up by people like @AOC @IlhanMN crazy people. Building it now.
@JudicialWatch Throw #RodRosenstein butt out of office and get to the documents.
@HardballChris @hardball your "logic" is loopy.
@HardballChris @SpeakerPelosi YOU are part of the national emergency. I know you think you're cute, but I think America is tuning into this now. I don't see you remaining speaker. You're propped up by people like @Ilhan and @AOC etc. You have ZERO credibility. You did your damage. You're immorl
@NicolleDWallace @maggieNYT @adamgoldmanNYT On the president?
So is it all about the money @Ilhan? https://t.co/HWXbY11p2Z
@politico #AmyDearest
@SpeakerPelosi @carlosvecchio Try speaking English @SpeakerPelosi
@RepJeffries You're the phony, Hakeem. We'll see what happens. Your @HouseFloor is out of control.
@senatemajldr How about another short CR and send the funding bill to conference committee and listen publicly to the Border Chief? @potus
@AaronBlake #RodRosenstein
Note, @SpeakerPelosi that @IlhanMN has retracted her apology. https://t.co/JcMswJmZtN
@rolandsmartin @IlhanMN No, she asks a stupid question--whether he thinks a massacre is fabulous.
@AaronBlake Someone in the group is going to be honest and say, this is a bad bill. Let's talk with leaders about another short term CR and get the Border Chiefs listened to.
@Philip_Elliott I think it's in trouble.
@jeneps I think they need another short-term CR with this in conference committee, not the people who ignored the Border Chiefs. @realDonaldTrump
Yes. https://t.co/OwdoGVJbvm
@Acosta @potus should offer another short-term CR until the funding bill is fixed.
This is GREAT! #HappyValentinesDay2019 https://t.co/XTBmfO4eVG
I think what might happen here is @WhiteHouse team finds problems with the funding bill and asks for corrections, and offers another short-term CR and conference committee, not the committee that came up with this one. https://t.co/ZvOEjVuobx
@HouseBudgetDems @RepJohnYarmuth I'll pursue avenues to throw you out of Congress.
@citypages @IlhanMN She supplies more nonsense than we need and did not do a good job of pursuing any questions. She just arrogantly attacks witnesses and attacks America. That's called anti-American.
@ClearWayMN @EatonSenator @smokefreegenMN They are suicidal. Why do our youth want to kill themselves? Important question.

@TwitterMoments McCabe you are TREASONOUS and a twisted fork.
@seungminkim @SusanKentMN See, @TinaSmithMN you should have negotiated instead of joining in to attack our #bordersecuritynow. See how it works? You can't pass something with just your own partisans. You need to FOCUS on making Congress work. That's my focus in #Election2020

@rapplerdotcom @mariaressa Well, the #freepress is out on bail. What's your next step? I loved the #ValentinesDay2019 story. Why don't you take good ideas from around the world since you are so international, @madeleine?

Well, this is not what we mean by "free press" of course, out on bail. https://t.co/rHqVsgzCZJ
@xbhaskarx @Bill_George Could you  be more specific. As far as Confederate flag,. Lincoln said soldiers on both sides "gave their lives, that that nation might live. The brave men, living and dead,  struggled here, consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract." White people, mostly.
@xbhaskarx @Bill_George Point being Britain, i.e. white people abolished slavery and the slave trade. So like I said join the cause of liberty. It's nothing to be offended. Don't get high on the $45 trillion you think you're owed. Liberty is not offensive, I agree w/@SteveKingIA
@Bill_George Whites fought a Civil War to end slavery. Remember that @xbhaskarx. So did your people do that? And why not? That's why you still have it all over the world. You should thank whites for their work on liberty and try to participate, don't tear down.
@RepRashida @cheniquajohnson @FSCDems No I DON'T believe it. Check out Bruce Vento.

@voxdotcom @ErinMayeQuade @Ilhan is an anti-American. She blames us for intervention for the sake of intervention. Just like she mindlessly believes if it were not for @AIPAC we would not support existence of Israel. It's ignorance, but leading to opposing America's role.
@SenWhitehouse I'll be working to remove you and your impeachers from the @USSenate
@Bill_George @Ilhan is ALSO anti-Christian and anti-Christmas. Not to mention anti-intellectual and anti-American. Moreso than @BarackObama even.
@SenateDems @SenatorCarper You're generally wrong. The fact you've turned into such a Stalinist that the @potus needs to be "protected" from you should give you pause. I hate your partisanship and you don't represent me for sure. So I assume Barr is confirmed.
@parrish4mn @phillipcparrish @GovTimWalz @MinnesotaDFL @GovMarkDayton put her in office, Phil. He hand-picked her as endorsed candidate with all the resources in the "special convention" following the state convention.
@RealJamesWoods @phillipcparrish Always have been unless a justice chooses to be real active leading his office.
@CD5DFL @TinaSmithMN I would definitely be a yes for Barr. @SenTinaSmith won't stop until she's aborted the entire country and its Constitution. She's no leader for #Minnesota
@gfherald This woman is extremely ignorant and her presence shows a very sick @MinnesotaDFL destroyed by #genderquotas, favoritism and lack of leadership, most notably @GovMarkDayton who hand-picked her. Like he thinks he's a junior high civics teacher.
@heatheretc @TVietor08 @IlhanMN @SpeakerPelosi @GovMarkDayton I just looked at it and it doesn't look like it's destroyed. Civil war to 1992. That's over. Looks like development is necessary. U.S. could be an ally of a democracy. U.S. role in hemisphere has traditionally been to promote independence and development of democracy.
@heatheretc @TVietor08 @IlhanMN @SpeakerPelosi @GovMarkDayton First, is the nation destroyed and second did U.S. policy destroy the nation?
@CBSNews I know. I'm fighting for change too. https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A
@heatheretc @TVietor08 @IlhanMN @SpeakerPelosi @GovMarkDayton He said it wasn't fabulous. He clarified that El Salvador democracy is fabulous. I don't know if it's democratic or not. That would be more the kind of question I would have. @IlhanMN aligns with violent groups. She doesn't represent Minnesota.
@MattZeitlin @chrislhayes I don't care.
@seanhannity Yes, if @SpeakerPelosi harms the United States interests and security. Absolutely, do what you have to do @realDonaldTrump to defend and secure the border. These @TheDemocrats are idiots and have to be replaced in #Election2020
@gatewaypundit @cristinalaila1 #AmyBermanJackson should run a Gulag. @realDonaldTrump campaign are AMERICAN HEROES! #fakenews must fall rapidly.
@thehill @Ilhan is an embarrassment to the United States. Ask @GovMarkDayton
@Tom_Winter @mitchellreports You would have loved working for Stalin or Castro, Andrea. This guy helped Reagan, Dole, Ford, and helped with a convention. You hate him, I CELEBRATE @HillaryClinton going down because she is like you. Creeps.
@MSNBC @mitchellreports Sure, Andrea, like @SpeakerPelosi looney @HouseFloor could "rebuke" anybody. That's REALLY funny. This means there is no credibility for an out-of-control politicized Congress, irrespective of the issue. If you're saying Pelosi wants Yemen to break off and destabilize ME. Problem
#AmyBermanJackson I hope you cried all night when @HillaryClinton went down to defeat. You are not an American, you're a Stalinist. This is your life.
@AaronBlake #AmyBermanJackson would fit in well working for Fidel Castro. In the name of the United States she basically persecutes Manafort for having political experience and helping Trump organize the convention. He worked for Reagan too, right? Ford, Dole. She and you Aaron are fascists.
@AaronBlake Who is this idiot judge?
@TVietor08 @IlhanMN I listened to this.Her behavior was attacking him. Everybody knows any "massacre" is not fabulous. So she's just abusing her unwarranted spot on this committee to goad and provoke an American official. I don't want her on the committee @SpeakerPelosi @GovMarkDayton YOUR fault.
@DavidRutz @IlhanMN The First Barbary War (1801–1805), also known as the Tripolitanian War and the Barbary .... Although John Adams agreed with Jefferson, he believed that circumstances forced the U.S. to pay tribute until an adequate navy
@RealSaavedra The First Barbary War (1801–1805), also known as the Tripolitanian War and the Barbary .... Although John Adams agreed with Jefferson, he believed that circumstances forced the U.S. to pay tribute until an adequate navy
@Ibutterfly34 Probably John Adams.
@RealSaavedra She's probably PO'd at John Adams for sending our navy over their to shut the pirates down.
@amyklobuchar Silly woman @amyklobuchar falls into the same trap as @KamalaHarris. @SenAmyKlobuchar how much more have workers been taking home in their checks because of the tax rate reduction? Have you even calculated this? You do calculate, right?
@philipaklein You're projecting your own convoluted ideas. "The base" is America. You should be informing them, not misleading them.
@Newsweek Why don't you go after @senatemajldr, @AnnCoulter? I don't see you helping to #BuildTheWall. @realDonaldTrump IS different but the voters have to make these @gop suffer at the polls if they continue mess over America. I include @HurdOnTheHill.
@SykesCharlie @Acosta There was an economic meltdown in 2013 but you're daft.
@kathrynw5 Yes, and he IS straightening it out as you attack Russians. Your #fakenews is a bad joke.
@kathrynw5 And he is still very concerned about it. And you? What do you write about? What ideas do you actually have in YOUR head about governing America?
@SenatorShaheen You could have secured the border, Jeanne, and stopped a lot of death and destruction. Why didn't you? Because it wasn't a woman trying to do it? Because "Republicans"? Because "racist"? Think about that.
@AP_Oddities @AP It's obvious we need a lot of camels in that part of the country. Better than horses.
@FocusCheryl @JackPosobiec @USSupremeCourt said you can't have an all-white primary. That means you can't racially or ethically or religiously or gender-rig the primary. Case is Smith v. Allwright.
@FocusCheryl @JackPosobiec Further what you overlook is that the primary is already rigged. There's a Somali caucus with guaranteed quota spots. There's a Muslim caucus with guaranteed quota spots. Mean white males are capped, Christians capped, whites capped. Greases skids for @IlhanMN. Unconstitutional
@marcorubio So?
@AP So, Deep State like @amyklobuchar then?
@rebeccaballhaus @maggieNYT What happened to the dog?
@politico Balogna. The unholy alliance simply won't elect any white male.
@cspanwj @jasonrileywsj @WSJopinion I trust @realDonaldTrump
@washingtonpost So when #fakenews uses "baseless" you need to understand they are not denying. They feel they can rule your thought with their proprietary "baseless" labels.
@amprog Let's not pretend you have any reasoning at all. Are you high?
@postpolitics "Leading @TheDemocrats"? Isn't that an oxymoron? @MarkWarner doesn't lead. He just tinkles all over #Election2016. He's very annoying and highly irrelevant.
@mattduss @vets4bernie And the missile tests?
@ike_salado_tx @WalshFreedom Joe simply doesn't have any ideas, doesn't discuss any ideas.
Just let me know when the service is happening and I'll join the tens of thousands watching online. @pastorkenrp @TinaSmithMN @MinnesotaDFL @GovTimWalz @MinnehahaAcad https://t.co/3uhs5a5Po6
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo You must have been a customer.
@KFILE There's no comparison between @Ilhan and @SteveKingIA. At all. Unless you're high on crack or something. @rolandsmartin
@PattyMurray I would never support it. @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN
That's for you #AmyDearest. Throw your binders around. https://t.co/PZmFv1xjuH
@KatyTurNBC Of course. But your violent, forceful assault on our #Election2016 is COMPLETELY unacceptable. We will vote with our feet and fingers--AWAY from consuming your greasy #fakenews media.
@JoeNBC Sure, Joe. Because some guy knocks over a camera. You're the thug. You like to lock up your political opponents, correct? Big football coach imprisoning your foes?
@ChrisCuomo BUT that's because you place your arrogant self higher than Border Patrol chiefs, isn't it? You have ZERO expertise and are actually a blowhard.
@rolandsmartin @Morning_Joe More #fakenews
@TamikaDMallory @IlhanMN I'll speak out and speak up and back @realDonaldTrump she needs to AT LEAST resign from foreign affairs. She does NOT represent Minnesota or the United States.
@abbydphillip Yeah, you're "riffing" as if you're a writer. LOLOL
@WalshFreedom You don't. When have you uttered a SINGLE idea?
@ChrisCuomo Chris is looney-tunes
@MeetThePress @chucktodd Look at this evil Chuck gloating because he doesn't care about #BorderSecurity he thinks he and his hated #fakenews will score a "win" over @potus. How twisted can people get?
@KamalaHarris Abortion &amp; Pregnancy Risks. Abortion. First trimester abortion is considered minor ... Complications associated with an abortion or having many abortions may ...Maybe @TinaSmithMN and @KamalaHarris should allow safety for pregnant women seeking abortion.
@KamalaHarris So do you count abortions? @TinaSmithMN
@WalshFreedom What actual IDEAS do you have? Not your "glory days". Give me an idea. I have already promoted one which you're probably totally unaware of. Because you're not  doing your homework.
@RepAdamSchiff You need to stop playing around. I fully support @realDonaldTrump steam-rolling over you.
@tedlieu You're not acting like an American and I wouldn't support you for the @HouseFloor
@NewsHour @SenatorLeahy Sure, Pat, why I remember when you were president....
@SenKamalaHarris Why don't you seek to extend DACA in exchange for border security? @amyklobuchar
@RepJeffries Maybe you can stop running your mouth. Why are you so disrespectful of @realDonaldTrump. Do you have an example of people talking about your favorite @BarackObama "running his mouth"? You should apologize.
@FocusCheryl @JackPosobiec I attended a meeting in a synagogue where @Ilhan swore she would NEVER support BDS. All the idiots clappoed. Kelliher thought she had it, with the suburbs and all. She's from outstate, 4H and not used to Minneapolis absolute craziness.
@FocusCheryl @JackPosobiec https://t.co/KfS0DzYPx2 She got under 50%, with @GovMarkDayton endorsement. Kelliher beat Dayton in convention for gov, and Torres Ray had the other immigrant votes (Guatemala).
@FocusCheryl @JackPosobiec Had @IlhanMN run through the caucuses for CD5 she would have got creamed. Probably @keithellison too @LoriSwansonMN would have beat him. There was knowledge of Ellison dragging his girlfriend, I think Omar knew it, can't prove it...Chaos. I call it #MuslimShift with 3 shifters
@FocusCheryl @JackPosobiec Again, all this happened after @MinnesotaDFL state convention. I hoped to eliminate @LoriSwansonMN that did happen. Then almost simultaneously @keithellison filed for @AGEllison and @IlhanMN moved to CD5. @GovMarkDayton immediately endorsed her. She ran a safe-seat election.
@feliciasonmez So what's this I hear @SenAmyKlobuchar will make a great @GOP prez candidate? @RoyBlunt seriously??
@feliciasonmez #AmyDearest my cowardly primary opponent couldn't debate out of a wet paper bag. Little @amyklobuchar used to sit in the board room and make faces at us when Chicanos wanted to play roles in the University government. I didn't realize one guy took over Morrill Hall to start ChicS
Here's where I scribbled out the original lyrics to #fightlikeagirl fighting @amyklobuchar #WarOnWomen with a legal war on cancer to reduce needless deaths. https://t.co/vk6Yxg2TD9
@Acosta @BBCJonSopel Well, you're haters on America for one thing. But it appears the goal was to knock over your camera. Need to know more about the guy who did it. But don't blame Trump. Blame yourselves, #fakenews. You're like Goebbels. Proud of that?
@nytpolitics So @SpeakerPelosi you come out now and explain why 55 miles what we need. Do it now. You need to be removed, and remove @Ilhan from your organization's foreign policy experts. Now.
This stupid "negotiation" is OBVIOUSLY UNacceptable, @senatemajldr. Now if you can get this on the floor and change the mileage and funding before sending it to @POTUS desk, through a conference committee, I'm sure he might sign it. But if now is wrong time #NeverTrumpers https://t.co/GBDTIrih80
@PostOpinions @EPPCdc @henryolsenEPPC @washingtonpost enjoys #shutdowns and #Impeachment. You're pathetic.
@MarkWarner @davidfrum Well, you like to play #shutdown and #Impeachment games, don't you @MarkWarner. I guess you think your voters like that. I'm not so sure. You are harming your own country though.
@justinsink @margarettalev @PressSec He knocked over a camera. That's not good. I don't see he "attacked" any journalist though. Seems to be more #fakenews. Probably need to know more about this guy.
@marykbruce @ThisWeekABC @potus, the leader @senatemajldr should not buckle. Try to add to it, Mitch and get something passed you can hash out in conference committee. Don't kick this down the road. America cares about this, Mitch. @gop Congress has been the problem. Don't play, please.
@MarkWarner @maddow I'm looking forward to you leaving the @USSenate
@WLTX Make them white, I'll buy a pair.
@WLTX They're nice shoes, this is ridiculous.
@Ilhan resign! https://t.co/1Fu4h2PrRp
@Newsweek Change the numbers on the @USSenate side.
@jeremyherb @Acosta @mkraju I would have nothing to do with @MarkWarner. I used to imagine he was related to John, but no.
@NYDailyNews He did not signal that  stop lying #fakenews. You'll PO @AnnCoulter
@ThisWeekABC @marykbruce Yes, "once it's finalized". @senatemajldr
@MarkWarner @davidfrum You better give so @potus can build #thewall I'm blaming YOU. Why would you do this? Politics, you like to advance your "career"? Don't play with us.
@FocusCheryl @janashortal Politics isn't something you want to get into and sell real estate, because they WILL attack your business for no reason. In my case they terminated my wife's #MABC #breastcancer treatment and it is dangerous. Dealing with @AGEllison on this now, YEARS of discontinuation of care
@FocusCheryl @janashortal @MPRnews and @MPRsMikeMulcahy and @tomscheck have been VERY dishonest in reporting about me. Knowing lies, for instance that I support @ToddAkin views that they say rape is "legitimate". VERY ignorant, knowingly false statements. Incompetence? #fakenews
@davidaxelrod @senatemajldr @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump You obviously want another #shutdown, David. Just like #AmyDearest
@mitchellreports @SenatorLeahy Yeah #fakenews gives a lot of play to idiotic statements of Patrick Leahy. He thinks he's funny because he's so "admired."
@NYDailyNews So please listen @USSenate @senatemajldr and see if you are bound by the whims of @SenSchumer. I think you are not and I think Schumer and @SpeakerPelosi want #OpenBorders and I want them out of  office. @POTUS
@kathrynw5 @YahooNews #AmyDearest treated her "staff" like slaves and adopted children. Just like "Mommy Dearest" and Joan Crawford. Maybe she can get on the board at Pepsi.
@BennieGThompson No you won't.
@rollcall I take it from @SenShelby idea of "agreement in principle" is that the numbers can be changed during the legislative phase. Probably in the @USSenate. AND we'll go from there. @senatemajldr shouldn't bring something to the floor that can't pass to override a veto. #AmyDearest
@kasie No it really IS how this works. #fakenews You do you, @realDonaldTrump is the president.
@SenatorHassan @NHDems No it is time and the only reason you're proud is you have VERY low standards for pride.
@markknoller AND you left out, Mark, that he's going to add things to it. I do see that happening.
@MSNBC @mitchellreports Which to dumbo @nbc means he's going to sign it wholesale.
@mitchellreports @kasie That IS how things work. Anyway don't care if you don't get that. Root for your little #fakenews #shutdown. And then we will shut YOU down! We don't need #FakeNewsMedia and you have been replaced. So sorry!
@Yamiche @NewsHour No you misreported it again @Yamiche. He said he would ADD THINGS to it. Did you really miss that? Or do you abuse your position to create #fakenews?
Absolutely CORRECT call by @realDonaldTrump. RESIGN @Ilhan! And @amyklobuchar should drop out since she bragged in her announcement that @IlhanMN was in the audience. Amy is CLUELESS. https://t.co/a8VMh0AmKm
@AaronBlake No, Aaron, YOU'RE wrong. You're literally NEVER right. @potus is "adding things to" the proposal and I'm sure his changes will be introduced and voted on at some time. Can't figure that out, huh? That's why "journalists" can rarely cover political legislation.
Right, @potus is ADDING THINGS to the inadequate #theWall proposal from Congress. He will get it done @amyklobuchar and if you had ANY class, you'd work with him right now, pretend you're not tugging @SenSchumer pantslegs. https://t.co/OrISlfj0pJ
@mitchellreports @kasie Yeah, you "cover every day". You NEVER cover them. You're incompetent and basically just a TV entertainer, like @potus. Only he's got the brains and you're #fakenews pushing gender.
So let's rewrite @Cmarianirosa this whole global warming research thing until we have more hard science. Let's develop a way to protect our forests, the world's forests from forest fires. @UMNews Let's prevent needless deforestation, isn't that scientific? Get @NobelPrize https://t.co/QnzgJFKL2I
News to me. But I'm sure if @swedense needs to learn it they will become a world leader. Remember what the Scandinavians did in Minnesota. Timber workers, and they created the @NobelPrize. @UMNews needs to team up with them for research IMMEDIATELY. https://t.co/QnzgJFKL2I
@maggieNYT Fool @TheDemocrats are trying to tie @POTUS hands so he can't defend the border. That's not going to fly. Prepare for a crash landing.
@carolmswain I don't know what she's supposed to be trusting. Immature, conceited men who only seek to pleasure themselves? What's to be trusted? This is called stupidity. Turn back to the church of God.
@robdelaney @vets4bernie The danger is in your drunken state you  can't tell the difference between the enemy and just another @Ilhan hate speech.
@TCNewsTalk It's really interesting this cultural difference of so-called "romantic" love, which  is just ignorance. Actually getting the parents involved produces much superior results and may reduce chaos and promiscuity.
@TCNewsTalk So this is a crime now? Lots of laughs.
@chicagotribune Can't the buildings or the @CityofChicago figure out some way to go up and melt the stuff so it won't fall off? You  know, job creation?
@dncpress So? That puts them in a better position to make business decisions and create jobs. You really don't know anything about business do you?
@rollcall I'll tell right now @SpeakerPelosi the "argument" of @RepJeffries etc. that it's a "permanent" wall for "temporary" amnesty for #DACA and #TPS is a stupid argument and rhetorical stunt. Because, OBVIOUSLY #TheWall is NOT permanent and  requires constant vigilance #fakenews
@rollcall So, @senatemajldr and @SpeakerPelosi should  allow it  to be voted on on the floor, and then allow amendments, which @LindseyGrahamSC @tedcruz should introduce, then go to conference committee. It will take more time but allow an end to the #shutdown2019. What about #DACA #TPS?
@thehill @wileymiller not so wiley
@BillKristol It still would not  be a crime to share polling data, Bill. It's not an elections violation. I could go over and get polling data on China and although they might not like it it would be no crime. And you know that Bill. You're grasping...
@BillKristol Let's go back to the premise. WHAT analytics of @HillaryClinton were hacked? Let's start from that.
@BillKristol You assume a lot of things. Including the #OpenBorders you love. @potus
@TwitterMoments @ShuttleCDRKelly So it will be the Air Force against the Space Men in #Election2020
@maggieNYT @IngrahamAngle Laura is wrong here. It's not a matter of perfection of the wall it's a matter of defending and securing the border. @potus is carrying out a means to an end, while taking immediate responsibility for the end--a secure border. CLARITY.
@AnnCoulter You're wrong Ann. We need to defend the border and we need to use every bit of wall we can to do that. You're coming at it the  wrong way.
@WalshFreedom You're way off Joe. What we need to do is DEFEND THE BORDER. That's what @potus said if you listened. And he said it would be a lot easier if the wall could be properly built. He said he will do that. I don't "fall" for anything and I can blast holes in your "argument." Think!
@janashortal is obviously just a shill for @Ilhan and friends. Disgraceful.
"Journalist" @janashortal has blocked me. I believe you can still see my work (didn't always use my non-Asian name) in the @MNHistoryCenter whose opening I covered. I stayed out of politics all that time and covered the news objectively. Yes, I still believe in objectivity
@janashortal @FocusCheryl So I was for 7 years the managing editor of the Asian American Press. And you are? I'm a Minnesota journalist. I know others in the business too who I've worked with. Journalism is not a money-making proposition.
@janashortal @FocusCheryl Oh I see. You're a "journalist" and I'm not because you aren't running for office. Meaning you line up in the nice little line and get selected by a corrupt national organization like @TheDemocrats like they did to @Ilhan. You're not a journalist, because you don't know these thg
@janashortal @amyklobuchar Should be #AmyDearest, @potus. Allusion to Mommy Dearest with Joan Crawford. But of course you spotted that already. I don't think she's earned a nickname yet. Let's see get on the trail.
@BillKristol There are many better writings to read, Bill. Your problem is you are sophomoric in your focus like a schoolboy. You don't "read Lincoln" in a few minutes. Read Volumes 1 and 2 of Lincoln Writings Library of America.
Here @MNFarmfest #AbrahamLincoln is promoting the farming movement. Americans found by farming they could produce an abundance of food and feed the cities with carts, then canals and rivers, then railroads. Lincoln's land-grant colleges created scientific farming. A genius. https://t.co/pF5nf9BIsW
Abraham Lincoln as Libertarian. Also: A Whig, the great founder of the Republicans. Democrats were SLAVE-HOLDERS. Lincoln had to work within the framework of the Constitution to end slavery and to maintain the United States as a whole. Newspapers were DEMOCRAT Party offical organ https://t.co/V5o9tVS81K
@cspanhistory So he was 23 years old and you quote him. LOL. Note from the photo on the left--he was county wrestling champion, also led militia in Black Hawk War. Those were some of his ambitions.
@tedlieu That was never true, Ted. I have both volumes of Lincoln Writings Library of America. You're quoting early ideas from a surprising diligent self-taught wilderness man from the West. Ideas change over time. You STILL don't know what Congress is about, L broke away and CREATED hist
@SarcasmAndBeer @janashortal @FocusCheryl As a former newspaper editor, as well as former government official at @UMNews I learned to watch how stories were covered--if they were covered at all--by rivals, and also to evaluate their additional information. With internet that's really not necessary, others will get you it
@SarcasmAndBeer @janashortal @FocusCheryl They're all cheerleaders. That's how they get hired. A journalist's job should be to completely report the facts and allow leaders to state their judgments on the facts. If media did this there'd be plenty of TRUE facts out there for us to consume. They could stop their  shows.
@AGEllison @MinnesotaDFL I've already been there, Keith. I want your office to pay attention to the gross cancellations of #breastcancer treatment coverage promised by Congress, YOU, and the Legislature. You're endangering women by hiding documents. https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A #FightLikeaGirl
@ericawerner Republicans say it is a bad deal. It was therefore a real stunt. Negotiators will have to do better. That's just reality you may not like it.
@ABCPolitics He's campaigning for a wall. You are #fakenews and you stink.
@secupp @IlhanMN She is completely rank. Abusing her basically appointed position (hand-picked by @GovMarkDayton after the state convention was over) for a "special convention" gathering of a few hundred confused partisans, to be on the ballot in a safe-seat district. We all knew she was crazy.
Join the #AmyDearest #hashtag. @amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar https://t.co/qvHsJGWM6Y
Seems to me when Trump's statements are compared to O'Rourke's, Beto is obviously the one lying. "end lives"? Is he serious? @BetoORourke @potus https://t.co/YcTsBdl5f1
@rolandsmartin You're not a historian Roland.
@StopBigMoney No. I don't dislike him or anything, but his partisan position is wrong, because he seeks a MONEY ADVANTAGE in every election, for HIM. I REALLY want to take money out, but he REALLY wants to make it impossible for anyone outside his little party club to compete. #AmyDearest
@samstein You say two-plus years after, but you IGNORE that she and @BarackObama are trying to overthrow the winner of that election. Are you DAFT? I think you are. How can you call yourself a "journalist", you're just a shill for the losers.
@washingtonpost Well "acceptable" is one thing but disrupting the government and a duly elected official is another, especially from decades ago. For Halloween I think imitating kids of another race is probably a problem. Dressing like Michael Jackson is probably different. Respect yes,
Wow! Better listen up @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN https://t.co/Rl568dxp5M
@LeaderHoyer I don't think you get this border security issue, Steny.
@LeaderHoyer @potus is very specifically saying @TheDemocrats are ignoring the expertise of the border patrol chiefs, which he is apparently relying on. And you're getting into minutiae of administering border processing as a kind of poison pill to shove us into #shutdown. So Trump's prevntng
@FocusCheryl @msnguy81 @janashortal Facts are true. So when I say she wasn't elected but hand-picked, appointed by @GovMarkDayton I'm referring to his selection of her after a state convention in which she did not run, in a chaos created by @LoriSwansonMN defeat at the convention. Check voter quotas too.
@FocusCheryl @janashortal @IlhanMN @MinnesotaDFL @DougWardlow Oh, @CorinneBraun she's the one I told right away. We had some discussions of what would occur. I was 100% right. Unfortunately. Now the genie's out of the bottle all over America. We may see Western Civilization dissolving before our very eyes. Yes, I studied political science
@FocusCheryl @janashortal @IlhanMN @MinnesotaDFL @DougWardlow We're the losers. But we can still win. @realDonaldTrump inspires many. I was already running for prez because of @IndyMN thing when I spotted Trump running. I caught on quickly.
@FocusCheryl @janashortal @IlhanMN @MinnesotaDFL @DougWardlow For days after @LoriSwansonMN dropped out beat by Northfield guy, there were reports of some big shifts coming, someone knew Ellison was going to go for statewide office. And someone knew about his girlfriend trouble too and he would be attacked in U.S. House, @dnc. Probably Omar
@FocusCheryl @janashortal @IlhanMN @MinnesotaDFL @GovMarkDayton I hate politics. I have high-minded goals, beautiful areas of study like math or science or art or philosophy. But our nation's survival literally relies on leadership. And no one seems to know what it is. Now we're all fighting each other for gender, race, morals, etc.
@FocusCheryl @janashortal @IlhanMN @MinnesotaDFL Ellison knew he could pull it off because he politicized the office, none of the voters cared about legal ethics, they painted @dougwardlow as anti-abortion and that's all Minnesota voters wanted to hear. Don't care about actual AG job, just national party politics.
@FocusCheryl @janashortal @IlhanMN @MinnesotaDFL I told this GOP consultant before Dayton nominated that it would be Omar because of the tight coordination of the shift. Omar comes from Somalian district to Minneapolis, Ellison to MNAG with national money and another Somalian to Omar's old spot. A shift. After convention.
@FocusCheryl @janashortal @IlhanMN @MinnesotaDFL Yes, if you look back at @GovMarkDayton statement he said "she's done a good job in the Legislature" so he endorsed her quickly. Kelliher beat him for Gov but he primaried her. So Kelliher has a high tech council job she's quiet and happy. And it's over.
@FocusCheryl @janashortal @IlhanMN @MinnesotaDFL @Ilhan @LoriSwansonMN @keithellison This is very misleading. Again, journalists don't get what's really happening. There's no contest inside Twin Cities from the Republicans. So you can disagree. But again she never even ran until after the state convention. Shock move. But okay that's my view.
@FocusCheryl @janashortal @IlhanMN @MinnesotaDFL @Ilhan @LoriSwansonMN @keithellison So of course the @MinnesotaDFL quickly announced a special CD5 primary after the convention. A few hundred people, with @GovMarkDayton picking the winner. I told the Republicans, Omar will be in Washington. They said, but won't there be an election? No. SAFE seats and #fakenews
@FocusCheryl @janashortal @IlhanMN And of course once she got the @MinnesotaDFL endorsement she got all the resources in a safe-seat district. It was a mess. And a Muslim shift, all AFTER the state convention and caucuses.
@FocusCheryl @janashortal @IlhanMN So I watched this very closely as a journalist and candidate. Immediately when I heard Ellison I said Omar is going to CD5. Even BEFORE @GovMarkDayton appointed her, which he quickly did. He had beat Margaret Kelliher, didn't like her, Patricia Torres Ray had no chance, he picked
@FocusCheryl @janashortal @IlhanMN Okay. So of course I ran for office, the @MinnesotaDFL primary so I was watching. At the state convention @Ilhan was not running for CD5 no one approved her, no one considered. When @LoriSwansonMN went down there was a Muslim shift. @keithellison to #MNAG @Ilhan to CD5. No votes.
@FocusCheryl @janashortal Absolutely we have to be critical consumers of #socialmedia. And people do self-select perspectives. The media attacks their consumers as liars and partisans instead of informing us. All of us have to learn. But #fakenews is going away.
@FocusCheryl @janashortal I saw your items, Cheryl, and it's an interesting list. The problem is this is going on 24X7X53, 365 days a year, real time. Making a list doesn't cut it, it's a whole wrong approach. Everybody attacks @realDonaldTrump I listen to him and I UNDERSTAND what he is sing. #fakenews
@FocusCheryl @janashortal Look at what happened with @IlhanMN today. This is on you, Minnesota #fakenews media. This person was not "elected" and you don't report that. Minneapolis does not want her attacking Israel and Jews in St. Paul OR Washington D.C. But you missed the story. I didn't.
@FocusCheryl @janashortal I'm a journalist, and have worked with many editors as a leader as well. You always get, our readers aren't interested. We can't report the news because our readers don't want to read it, and the advertisers won't pay for it. The #socialmedia model is breaking all this up.
@FocusCheryl @janashortal The whole model of news is wrong. They all try to report the same thing, and they buy their national news from national news organizations without any editing. What they should do it report DIFFERENT things. Then there would be a market for ALL of them. Wouldn't lose so many jobs
@FocusCheryl @janashortal The problem is, @janashortal, that politics is way too complicated for you to report. So you don't even try. I've known this since I was in government in 1977. You show up your producers tell you what to shoot, a sound-byte you report "We were there." Nothing. Be modest.
@janashortal @FocusCheryl You boosted @Ilhan why? Because you're not journalists, you follow around the @MinnesotaDFL. You're an official mouthpiece for their naitonal racket. Show me where you ever reported, ever, the voter quotas which cap men, whites, straights, Christians, etc. in the DEMOCRATIC PARTY
@janashortal @FocusCheryl @startribune @PioneerPress @duluthnews @PB_News @MPRNews @wcco @kstp @kare11 for starters. Yes, I too am a journalist. But NOT #fakenews
@danpfeiffer Where's the inconsistency @jameshohmann? Why do you say these ridiculous things?
@RonBrownstein @Graniteprof No it is NOT racial resentment. You're lying #fakenews. No one believes your stuff anymore. I remember when media were respected. Now you're the lowest common denominator. You have no accountability and have abandoned the notion of truth entirely.
@markknoller That's right, we're building the wall anyway. Despite losers like "centrist" @amyklobuchar and baby-killer @TinaSmithMN
Yes, #fakenews is being driven crazy. Because they're losers. And #SocialMedia does not need them.
The pandas are cool https://t.co/XQxvXrDjzP
@CillizzaCNN Walls don't end lives, that's dumb @BetoORourke
@TVietor08 He's kickin butt watch out.
@IronStache @realDonaldTrump @packers That's not socialism.
@potus 52-47% +5% today. He. Could. Go. All. The. Way!
It's true, Americans HATE the #fakenews and they have charted a way for themselves out of business. @potus is leading America with 93% hate-filled press from the fake commercial media. Fortunately we have #Internet
From the Lakes of Minnesota...... @potus Proud to be an American. Not a #genderquota queen of #AmyDearest or an @Ilhan subject.
Most of the crappy rock music used at rallies, who don't want their  name used, I don't want to hear it anyway. They are expendable. I think this is Pavarotti.
This Texas El Paso auditorium is where I heard my first rock concert: Three Dog Night, Guess Who, some others. @potus coming.
@AndrewCMcCarthy @NRO @GovMarkDayton thinks he knows better than all Minnesotans and thinks she's GREAT! He blamed St. Cloud people when a migrant stabbed 11 people in a shopping center. It's their fault for making the assailant to that. Mark is wrong. Gets and "F", not a 'D".
Beautiful tree. https://t.co/cYFYdBKVaz
@RealCandaceO Check out their voter quotas and say something. Candace. Do you know what I'm talking about? I brought it to the @USSupremeCourt
@RepMarkMeadows #shutdown and #NationalEmergency
@SpeakerPelosi You all have to go.
@RepLeeZeldin @HouseForeign Where you're wrong @SpeakerPelosi is that @IlhanMN is just what @SteveKingIA is talking about the attacks on #westerncivilization
@TheDemocrats You're low intelligence and are responsible for the foolish @SpeakerPelosi shutdown.
@amyklobuchar So are you trying to explain why you thought @IlhanMN @Ilhan was supporting you in the audience? Why did you telll your followers that Omar was there? Just curious, of course.
@DeanObeidallah @IlhanMN The problem is @Ilhan doesn't recognize the right of Israel to exist. She said just the other day they shouldn't exist because they're "not a democracy". I tweeted to her that is not the way it works. You don't tell states they can't exist because you disapprove of their govt.
So @IlhanMN is also sad if a Muslim celebrates #Christmas. @MinnesotaDFL should not be attacking Christmas, @GovTimWalz. What is WRONG with you people?? @Ilhan just follows whatever political winds blow to get in the position to hurt @potus foreign policy. #MerryChristmas! https://t.co/5IxJaiBHW7
@NRSC @SenTinaSmith @IlhanMN Well, both @TinaSmithMN AND @amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar said that yesterday  @Ilhan was WITH THEM in Minneapolis kicking off the #AmyDearest campaign for @POTUS. So can't they recognize her? How disorganized IS Klobuchar?
@SenRonLatz Minnesota House member speaks out against @IlhanMN behavior. So will he support replacing her in #Election2020? This is what happens with #genderquotas and #racequotas and even guaranteed delegates for Somalians and Muslims in the @MinnesotaDFL. When will this be changed? Freedom
@DLoesch @replouiegohmert @IlhanMN I would like to know exactly who's paying off @GovMarkDayton and @SpeakerPelosi to keep someone like @Ilhan on @HouseForeign committee. @StarTribune @MPRnews @NPR
@B52Malmet Yeah except he didn't say that. And @SenWarren isn't an Indian and wasn't on any trail except the wagon trail.
@RealSaavedra Well, as @potus says, @SpeakerPelosi is a weak leader, about to slide into a #shutdown. People like @Ilhan don't care about a #shutdown2019, they just want to make a point. If Pelosi ACTS against @IlhanMN they'll remove her. Real question is when will Pelosi be booted.
@GOPChairwoman Obviously @SpeakerPelosi must do this  as she must stop her poison-pill strategy to maintaining #OpenBorders
This is not unequivocal. I've already pointed out that @AIPAC has a right to advocate their positions. But @IlhanMN simply recognizing that shows she is not really listening. What does she actually KNOW about the issue, not just the money used for PAC activity? https://t.co/HpiiekJCyy
@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs @amyklobuchar is running against you now. So she and her @SenateDems will be saying you're "lashing out" by calling this behavior crazy. It is. So is @SenAmyKlobuchar coddling @IlhanMN pretending she was at her launch when she did not attend.
@thehill @thehill stupidly uses "lashes out" as #shutdown approaches. They're idiots.
@chrislhayes Can't even use the word "tolerant".
@ThisWeekABC If you don't straighten this out now @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN you are responsible for yet another shutdown. You have idiots like @SenatorDurbin aligned with you. Dick the sappy loser.
@JeannieR207 @mitchellreports @GayleKing @GovernorVA @UMNews But I think in academia we shouldn't talk about "distraction from 'the real issue'". Truth matters. And as indentured servitude being a form of slavery I disagree. For instance apprenticeship. And it wasn't the real issue of slavery for those Europeans able to fulfill contracts.
@TPNN_ThePoint I found this: "1705 - In An act concerning Servants and Slaves, Virginia’s lawmakers: Increase the indenture of a mulatto child born to a white woman to 31 years." So "indenture" was in use as late as 1705. Needs to be investigated
@BrentScher @FreeBeacon Just remember #AmyDearest and you got it.
When will @amyklobuchar speak? https://t.co/sGIbn6WJnU
@MariaTCardona If you were president you'd understand, Maria.
@amyklobuchar @GStephanopoulos And what did she say about @IlhanMN being at her campaign kick-off for president? And what about #buildthewallnow?
@rollcall #AmyDearest
@mollyhc I watched @amyklobuchar herself say @Ilhan was at her #snowflake kickoff. Someone should ask @SenAmyKlobuchar to clarify what she mean, plus the true meaning of e pluribus unum. She seemed to think it meant out of many, many. #AmyDearest
@michelleinbklyn No, it's not possible. It can't be pernicious for @AIPAC to exercise their lawful right to advocate regarding American policy. I call on my opponents @amyklobuchar and @TinaSmithMN to condemn this statement and tweets. I favor taking $$$ out of elections, NOT selective attacks.
@ggreenwald @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib So Glenn, do you have evidence you'd like to share about @Ilhan charge of buying off politicians to shape U.S. policy toward Israel? I mean yes there's free speech, but what is the evidence for this charge? I believe the charge is not true.
@postpolitics So it appears @DonnaShalala that as @HHSGov Secretary January 22, 1993 –January 20, 2001 you presided over watching women diagnosed by NBCCEDP die without appropriate #breastcancer treatment and then over the passage of #BCCPTA. Did you support the #TreatmentAct? The regulations?
@larryrjacobs She's #amyDearest
@hughhewitt @amyklobuchar #AmyDearest. I remember she used to sit and make faces at us as we brought Chicano students into @umncla government meetings. Still would like to know what she was doing there. I remember asking her about her father whose work I had read.
@kasie @amyklobuchar Or...you could be a @SalvationArmyUS bellringer. Like my wife. In 2016, she contracted pneumonia and her #MABC #breastcancer treatment was cut off--by @amyklobuchar says @E_J_Piper. @MedicareGov paid for the diagnosis but not medication. I used my SA check $50 for medication. #ap
@EWErickson @DavidMDrucker So....thank you? Actually thank you.
@FreeBeacon @BrentScher So @BetoORourke could just be "Bob" then. You're right, it's not very imaginative.
@JackPosobiec @TeaPartyNevada Is there evidence @RalphNortham dressed as the KKK?
@thehill So she dodged and actually lied. Apparently the ones with the binders thrown at them are not on the staff now. Or are they? #amyDearest
@postpolitics So it appears @DonnaShalala that as @HHSGov Secretary January 22, 1993 – January 20, 2001 you presided over watching women diagnosed by NBCCEDP did without appropriate #breastcancer treatment and then over the passage of #BCCPTA. Did you support the #TreatmentAct? The regulatns?
@D_A_Irwin @davidfrum @snlester So this one is on @SpeakerPelosi. #amyDearest @SenAmyKlobuchar @SenTinaSmith
@CillizzaCNN @CBS See that's a @TheDemocrats for you. Every American has privileges. Not only white people. And they should not be taken away. Not for whites. Not for anybody.
@tariqnasheed @TeaPartyNevada So what is the actual fact on this? Obviously slave traders didn't get the Africans who sold their neighbors to sign a contract. And I've seen descendants of those people interviewed by @HenryLouisGates. Did "traders" get someone else to sign a less than perpetuity contract?
@CillizzaCNN No, folks, this is  #fakenews. @realDonaldTrump
@kylegriffin1 @rolandsmartin How many of these are because they can't deduct their state and local taxes?
@JawnMurray @rolandsmartin #FightLikeaGirl to save lives. https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A
@SpeakerPelosi has simply got to go. @potus @vp is she really drunk here? It seems like it. Maybe she didn't have the courage without a stiff drink to take on the @realDonaldTrump on securing our borders. Absolutely disqualifying. #AmyDearest https://t.co/E3DMKIkjLy
@SenGillibrand @rachelsklar #AmyDearest https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A #FightLikeaGirl
@RepAdamSchiff Nobody believes this, A. B you don't have the right to do it. C you're getting very tiresome.
@epmurphymn @_cingraham Don't ignore women deprived wrongfully of their #breastcancer government treatment coverage while they're in treatment. https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A
@Ilhan draws fire from @HillaryClinton side. @GovMarkDayton thought this would be a good idea but no. #AmyDearest might say something about it too, instead of "Ilhan is here supporting my @amyklobuchar for prez campaign!" https://t.co/aRNZz2EUyE
@DNKultur @dagensnyheter Wow, Heavy? I'll have to check it out. I don't watch the show, but I'll try to hear it.
@CNN Here's #FightLikeaGirl: https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A Power of music to save lives.
@MalcolmNance You pretend you're intel but overlook the fact Trump was working on a Days of Our Lives soap opera when he made those statements. They're not admissions.
@JackPosobiec This is @GovMarkDayton's work. He thinks he's a teacher.
@GOP That's why there's a #hashtag called #AmyDearest
Yes, @Joy_Villa is right, we need to secure our borders. And of course we can do more, but we need a secure border to bring economic development and community to both sides of the border region. I'm the only one talking about it. Why I run. @MinnesotaDFL https://t.co/DDOF0OGat6
@kylegriffin1 And so you think you  should structure the @potus time for him, bigshot repoirter?
@thauserkstp @politico Oh so you noticed Tom. I immediately said this was a bad call by @GovMarkDayton. She wasn't fit to run for the Minnesota legislature because of her well-known statements. It isn't because of her religion that I'm critical it's her inability to think straight. @Ilhan
@amyklobuchar Time for you to go #AmyDearest
@rolandsmartin It's not a lie, Roland and you do people a disservice by your attacks on @potus. The fact is, Roland, you don't know what work is. And I can't convince you because you think it's your profession to already know. This is where a lot of this class warfare Reagan mentioned is from.
@TinaSmithMN @amyklobuchar She's no "fighter". She rigs the elections so men can't vote and then impresses a lot of man-hating women when she "wins." You too.
Let me remind you that #AmyDearest had @Ilhan at her kick-off today, and that this was @GovMarkDayton to appoint this lunatic to represent Minneapolis in the @HouseFloor https://t.co/0cNANHqVOv
@politico Treason by @SenWarren. She should withdraw from the race.
@soledadobrien @rolandsmartin @DanRather can't think, period. I'm SO glad those days when you had to listen to him drone on and pontificate--are GONE.
@nytimes @SenWarren comments constitute treason and I call on @SenAmyKlobuchar who just entered the race to denounce these comments of Warren. @potus
@cehm27 @Jus10Dyson And a lot of people were forced to travel: Spanish, French and English as well. Canadians. That's how the nation was formed. And yes, we should have discussion about American Indians. Very important. But not @SenWarren
@Jus10Dyson @cehm27 Yes. I don't have a problem with it. Pocahontas is very famous in New York, a historical figure. He's saying Pocahontas she isn't and yet pretended to be an American Indian. I understand his point.
@cehm27 @Jus10Dyson Well, that's my point. But you're talking about just one reference. I'm saying it's a larger issue and the president is talking about something else.
@DanCrenshawTX It's not policy and it's not theirs to make. It's up to the @potus
@thehill Could be a hacker, could be from a foreign country. @potus
@cehm27 @Jus10Dyson Remember @SenWarren is NOT an Indian. She did NOT go on the Trail of Tears! But she will have to go on the campaign trail and not just sit in Massachussetts.
@cehm27 @Jus10Dyson If I thought Trump was making fun of the Trail of Tears I'd bring it up. The way people tweeted about it I had to take a look. More #fakenews!
@cehm27 @Jus10Dyson I've done very well and I'm not finished. So you don't like Trump that's YOUR problem. #maga
@thehill #AmyDearest wants a #shutdown
@KThomasDC Based on @SenWarren statement shows he lacks the temperament and he can trash her as much as he wants. She's despicable. I know she'll never apologize.
@mviser @chelsea_janes So she has NEVER held an executive position, correct? She's not competent at all. She has to make that case and today she didn't make it. #AmyDearest
@NYDailyNews From the activity I see and his role in it I believe him completely on this. But you don't know anything about presidents.
@mviser @chelsea_janes "Competence"? Like the time #AmyDearest prosecuted Kirby Puckett for sexual assault???!!! Tell some truth now.
@mitchellreports @GayleKing So @GovernorVA may be correct on this. It's not for you and Gayle as #fakenews to lord it over the TV screen. You need to make an inquiry, which you are not capable of, this kind of thought. This is why I created Cultural Pluralism requirement at @UMNews
@mitchellreports @GayleKing So in about 1640 three indentured servants escaped. They could have added years to their contract. But the judges, again, YOU, your buddies, decided the law, that they would make the African a servant for life. It DOES advance it if you pay attention.
@mitchellreports @GayleKing No, you are WRONG, Andrea, and apparently don't know anything about this when you draw your sweeping conclusions. Indentured means with a contract with mutual rights. Otherwise the condition was virtually the same between African and European servants. Originally they were flflld
@McFaul @mitchellreports Uh Benghazi WHAT Michael? So that was investigating @BarackObama. Pls don't tweet stupid things.
@DiamondandSilk Well I immediately disagreed because they didn't have contracts. Well they may have or thought they did but the Virginia judges and lawyers refused to acknowledge any and reduced them to property..
@PhilPina @chris_magan @PioneerPress First of all #AmyDearest is a sniveling coward and isn't going to debate anybody. Secondly, she's not going to get near @realDonaldTrump because she's going to be eliminated.
@nytimes #RobertMueller is disgraced for history and needs to be shut down. This is the @potus job and this is unlawful interference.
@Jus10Dyson @cehm27 So just by saying she had to be on the trail, he meant to insult all of those on the trail of tears. That's quite a stretch.
@cathleendecker @chelsea_janes @mviser "Message of competence" lots of laughs. E pluribus unum, out of one, no wait... #AmyDearest @amyklobuchar
@gatewaypundit @cristinalaila1 Deceptive statement by #AmyDearest since America is ONE dream, it's not one country with a lot of dreams that may or may not be shared by all. Yes, liberty allows people to have their own dreams. But that's part of one dream. @SenAmyKlobuchar
@stranahan I'm serious, Lee, you need to tie in clearly to American system, you can't say Ukraine or Russia did this or that. If you're saying that is all you see in Paul Manafort is foreign attacks on him, then say so. But I think you're implying more. Please make it clear.
@RepWalterJones My sympathies to friends and family
@Jus10Dyson @cehm27 Well, she's out on the campaign trail and it is going to be tough, and I think that's worth saying. If he wanted to say Trail of Tears instead of campaign trail he could have done so. So he capitalized TRAIL, that's not enough for me you can read it in.
@cehm27 @AMunkelwitz So it makes no sense to just focus on one case for a few tribes to Oklahoma.
@cehm27 @AMunkelwitz There are many trails. Virtually all the Indians were removed, not just this Marshall case.
@hoskinschuck @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump So you don't believe border security is needed. Well, that's not #fakenews and I didn't get the idea from @potus. I've been campaigning on it since 2010.
@hoskinschuck @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump So tell me some #fakenews I get from Trump
@hoskinschuck @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump I ran for prez in 2016. I don't follow the masses.
@dmrcaucus @DMRegister Yes, @dmrcaucus but that is because she refuses to debate, and she uses the #genderquota to drive males out of the caucus and convention nomination system and then lies about it. Excellent liar but wilts with requirements for specifics and answering honest questions.
@realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats are insane, and are acting on orders from @SpeakerPelosi. With the love and affection of #amyDearest
@TheDCSentinel @vets4bernie Yes, some call her #amyDearest
@FHQ @Graniteprof @huzzahmpls Well, she and ally @GovTimWalz expressed hatred for @Twitter. #amyDearest
@NYDailyNews @SenAmyKlobuchar She's running from every debate. Refused to debate me, her runner-up in Minnesota's @MinnesotaDFL primary but sicced her dogs on taking away my wife's #breastcancer treatment coverage. So NOT for "every American". #amyDearest
@CBSNews My answer to #amyDearest: NO president has done more to create opportunity than @realDonaldTrump and that will continue. YOU, @amyklobuchar are the mistress of chaos, trying to bring down the government and imprison your opposition. Also, e pluribus unum learn what it means.
@hoskinschuck @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @CNN You don't get any #fakenews from @potus. Right now focus with him on border security.
Yes, just like the real tough Joan Crawford, she's got a deal lined up with David Johnson to deliver 700,000 and win the #IowaCaucus. Treacherous for her though because we don't know how many of those are not women and may not vote for #amyDearest @SenAmyKlobuchar https://t.co/kVjHjocVlm
Ugly politics of @SenWarren and #amyDearest is imprison Trump and other opposition figures. She's "centrist" though, @amyklobuchar is. https://t.co/Np0k3aA7bo
#amyDearest feigns annoyance with #shutdown2019 but the truth is we know she's itching for a #shutdown not to defend so-called #DACA or #TPS but to limit beds and the like at the border. Pretending not to care about a barrier now. @amyklobuchar wants an Oscar like Mommy Dearest https://t.co/y8zIRxrlUR
@thauserkstp She's got a new #hashtag #amyDearest
@chelsea_janes @AaronBlake Ray once claiming: “As a human being, Joan Crawford is a very great actress. ... and made every effort to live up to their expectations of the image she had created (“if ..." Same as #amyDearest. BTW she heartlessly supports cutting off breast cancer treatment for low-income womn
@chelsea_janes @AaronBlake This is #amyDearest a new #hashtag just for her. Watch Mommy Dearest on Joan Crawford. I think @amyklobuchar may have plagiarized Joan right here.
@JoyceWhiteVance I think his point is perfectly legitimate. Your people want to act vicious for #faknews. He's going to slug back and I support @realDonaldTrump
@DisavowTrump20 Oh, definitely #amyDearest
@hoskinschuck @realDonaldTrump Intelligent people LISTEN to @realDonaldTrump
@KateTBarry @amyklobuchar E pluribus Boon 'em
@PardonJamesWebb John Hanson was Swedish from Maryland, 2nd generation.
@AdamParkhomenko Show me where he says trail of tears. #fakenews
@jessewente He is not. And since you talk about Indian history, it wasn't just the North Carolina Indians that were induced or forced to migrate from their ancestral lands. So you know very little.
@LittleMissFlint He is not a racist.
@cehm27 Oh, really, so where does he say this? I think you and I both know he didn't.
@DonnaFEdwards @amyklobuchar Yeah, real TOUGH, Donna.  #amyDearest is so tough she rips the #breastcancer treatment  right away from women in active #BCCPTA treatment. And you're tough enough looking not to give a damn. Yeah, you both real tough.
So apparently we have launched, on the hated @Twitter a #hashtag about @amyklobuchar campaign called #amyDearest. This refers to the movie "Mommie Dearest" about Joan Crawford, the hard, driven actress who mistreated her adopted children. She Throws Binders is her Indian name.
@CillizzaCNN Yeah, I really like the way she handled "e pluribus unum." #amyDearest didn't make those rookie mistakes @algore did. Yep, @MarcACaputo
@KurtSchlichter Well, wouldn't you complain if you had to make a speech in conditions like this?
@joelpollak @amyklobuchar #AmyDearest doesn't even support Minnesota steel, which would be helped by #BuildtheWal, out of steel. Why not? @MinnesotaDFL doesn't care about Minnesota jobs, only votes to raid the federal treasury.
@JohnCroman Yeah. You're a "political reporter" but you will NEVER report (so I'm reporting it for you on the hated @Twitter) that your party, John, caps men, limits their participation to under 50% when you consider each as a whole, e.g. a white man. 40% of delegates tops. REPORT. IT.
@amyklobuchar You have to be a hater to take #MABC breast cancer treatment coverage away from low-income women in the middle of their treatment. You are a hater, #AmyDearest
If @amyklobuchar had a binder she would have thrown it at herself when she slipped up just like @algore on e pluribus unum. #AmyDearest (Mommy Dearest) performs with intense demands on herself or blows up. https://t.co/l4hQXGluuI
Thank you @LindseyGrahamSC get that out there how @TheDemocrats like "everyone matters" @amyklobuchar are trying to blow up the negotiations and put this country back in #Shutdown2019 https://t.co/NRPjo0U3oH
@thehill Technically they were indistinguishable from the European indentured servants, EXCEPT that they Africans were paid the gold for selling their neighbors did not give them any kind of contract. Lawyers like @amyklobuchar and @keithellison were able to make them slaves in perpetuity
@DMRegister But don't forget the basic rule of Presidential  primaries. Out of one...no, never mind. E pluribus, unum. And not #AmyDearest
So @amyklobuchar it's like this. "E" means out of in Latin. "Pluribus" is "many", a form of that word. So it's "Out of many." "Unum" then means "one." So remember that. @algore
@amyklobuchar is so melodramatic in her near-crying performance, I'll name her #AmyDearest. Should win an Oscar.  Oops, made the same mistake @algore with with E pluribus unum. I have grit too @SenAmyKlobuchar
Wow, both @amyklobuchar and @GovTimWalz attack @Twitter hatefully. Why is that?
Why won't #Klobuchar2020 admit she is terminating #MABC low-income #breastcancer treatment coverage while the women are still in TREATMENT?? What is the DIFFERENCE, @amyklobuchar between these women and Nicole's SON?? Why do you do this. Silence....
As her runner-up candidate in 2018 @USSenate @MinnesotaDFL primary I can tell you she DOES run. She runs from anything looking like a debate. I would make a monkey of her in any debate. @washingtonpost @WashTimes @realDonaldTrump will be a REAL obstacle.
@amyklobuchar becomes openly boastful. People don't know that she gets the benefit of a #genderquota which caps, and REMOVES men from voting when they try to attend and nominate candidates for @USSenate. You won't hear it, because it's NATION-WIDE, @DNC does this. Ace liars
Very plaintive, as if she's lamenting, @amyklobuchar did not write a very good speech. Klobuchar
Isn't her nose supposed to grow longer or something? Klobuchar
@GovTimWalz who insists all #AmyDearest does is win, also swears there were more people at #BoomIsland fiasco than at @potus inauguration. Any fact-checkers in the audience? Or nah? Klobuchar
So when is Klobuchar event going to get serious? Our next "president"? This is embarrassing. We all do better, uh-huh, except the MA-BC cancer patients, they're treatment coverage can be stolen by @amyklobuchar @GovTimWalz @keithellison etc. for no reason. https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A
Klobuchar @TinaSmithMN They tell me Senator Amy Klobuchar, they say she started up a NEW kind of war, a war on women, on older women STRICKEN with cancer, say she won't even give 'em a chance to live, cause they're old, and reaching 65 alive https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A
@TinaSmithMN says she's a "FIGHTER" like @amyklobuchar yeah they fight against Minnesota low-income #breastcancer patients, they steal their funding to spend on welfare and deny them due process. https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A #FightLikeAGirl @SenAmyKlobuchar @MinnesotaDFL
Duluth mayor Emily Larson stresses she's from GREATER Minnesota, meaning not in the Twin Cities. That's seen by many @MinnesotaDFL as chauvinistic term saying outstate Minnesota (more white) is better than the Twin Cities. Tone-deaf. Klobuchar #AmyDearest @amyklobuchar
Anybody who watched this Minnesota Loony @amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar event would be reminded of Lake Woebegone where all the voters are BELOW average. #AmyDearest
@amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar event starts out with talk of the original sin and how grateful women should be. smh Inheritors of "wisdom" of Eve
Right, I should try to use that line when facing @LoriSwansonMN @KeithEllison who insist @amyklobuchar wants to cancel my wife's #breastcancer treatment coverage in the middle of her treatment. "Walk across our sturdy bridge..." https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A https://t.co/TqSYwcbMsm
#AmyDearest trashes her parents. She came from Wayzata High School, a posh Minnesota suburban school. Then some kind of Yale deal where she did work around the @UMNews. So her parents had no money? https://t.co/ZnQlBKp98Q
@KamalaHarris Yeah, well just watch out for #AmyDearest. Bring a helmet with you. @SenAmyKlobuchar
@larryrjacobs #AmyDearest @SenAmyKlobuchar "centrist" doesn't have any issues, just fluff.
@mitchellreports Lucy's holding the football...
@merica @mviser So far #AmyDearest has nearly filled a warming house. A difference between @KeithEllison as CD5-MN rep (where this is) and @Ilhan who wasn't invited for fears she'd start throwing snowballs at Israelis. Strictly #snowflakes
Remember #daca and #tps? All BS from BS @TheDemocrats @SenateDems. So where are they? Well #AmyDearest had another breakdown and invited all her friends to an icy island in snowbound Minnesota. Promises bread, circuses, and hot chocolate. https://t.co/uBLC2NnPiM
@Yamiche @mitchellreports @GayleKing "Indentured servants"? So you mean they signed a contract?
@WashTimes This guy @RepAdamSchiff is a lunatic
This is your souvenir from the #AmyDearest campaign. Shout out to Jennifer Brooks for the shot. https://t.co/orvFw0U92i
#AmyDearest always leaves people out in the cold. Here's her #WaronWomen https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A Older women stricken with cancer, they say she doesn't even want to give 'em a chance to live, cause they old, and reaching 65 alive. She just won't let 'em survive. https://t.co/saeka6rYzX
@ninamoini @PatKessler @esmemurphy Who or what are you marrying?
Well, I guess we know where all the #snowflakes will be today. Swooning to the #centrist #AmyDearest. https://t.co/BGyZnPL6ni
@TheoKeith @TinaSmithMN @Tim_Walz @peggyflanagan @Jacob_Frey I hope they'll be polite and shut up so everyone won't have to freeze their buns off.
@robcrilly Right, it would make things a little more fair. But those aren't the rules and let it be known #AmyDearest freely chose to be at this location. Favorite drinking establishment, #brettKavanaugh
@MikeDaySMM @amyklobuchar @maddow The lies begin already.
@BoomerPost1234 @amyklobuchar #AmyDearest for Prez! Yeah! Shish Boom Bah!
All the others were thrown at the heads of the poor Cookie Team by #AmyDearest. Talk about #MinnesotaNice! https://t.co/w2sElVfYak
@Room340C Who's holding the football, @mprnews?
@AlexLehnertFox9 @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN @GovTimWalz @peggyflanagan @Jacob_Frey Now might be a good time to bring up Amy's War on Women....https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A
So it's kind of like walking the plank then. "Walk the Plank with #AmyDearest". Or else. https://t.co/rkNHwZ0Q3l
@RevDrBarber @rolandsmartin From yearbooks? First you need to be honest about face-painting. Don't use it to spread hateful lies. If you want to address it understand it. Mostly it's complimentary imitation by famous entertainers. Anyway it's not for your judgment. Freedom is needed not yoru iron fist.
@RevDrBarber @rolandsmartin "Environmental racism". Meaning what exactly? Yearbooks? History? I'm sure you don't think there's a benefit from obliterating history. We need to learn from  history. Not use it to attack people. When you do that people can't even SEE history, just your livid disposition.
@DisavowTrump20 @rolandsmartin #AmyDearest @SenAmyKlobuchar
@drunkhistory @rolandsmartin @ambermruffin @amandlastenberg This is not literally true since there were black schools. So it's dishonest to say the students "had to fight for their education" and I don't know the purpose of being dishonest. Also, it was courts that decided, they did not. So you're just agitating people with actors. Why?
@rolandsmartin @TheAtlantic So I get it, you don't like white people @rolandsmartin. Congratulations on your great intellect and spirituality.
@soledadobrien @rolandsmartin As usual @JamilSmith is loopy but Trump didn't say trail of tears. Trail of Tears is inaccurate, because many Indian peoples were induced or forced to migrate from ancestral lands. But to read this into to "trail" is intellectually dishonest, as usual. Everythings "racism" sure.
Friendly bird https://t.co/NfGTBL2JgW
What I want you to remember, and people like @RepJohnYarmuth is that @TheDemocrats were posing as EXPERTS in border security. But they were trying to tie the hands of @DHSgov. #shutdown2019 @SpeakerPelosi. https://t.co/g0fvQGvC9l

@margbrennan @CBSNews @GayleKing @FaceTheNation @GovernorVA @RalphNortham Yeah, Margaret don't try to look like her or you'll be in trouble.
@DaveOrrick #AmyDearest
@rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @MELANIATRUMP @BarackObama Obama's own biography said he was born in Kenya. And I know you'll have some slippery excuse for that but it's not "racist." Get some new material.
@rolandsmartin He should not apologize. He stood up for safety, as he should. Leaders do that. @potus
@RevDrBarber @rolandsmartin You engage in voter suppression, @RevDrBarber. I know that you know. And I  know that you will never say. God would tell you to reveal this, but you don't listen to God you listen to man.
@washingtonpost Let's be honest here. In America PARENTS are under attack from officious government agencies. Those are parental rights. You're talking about some working conditions, not parental rights, stop lying. Of course #fakenews won't stop.
@jmartNYT Anyone who uses words like "Trumpy" is an idiot. There is no "Trumpy". There's a president who is leading. There are LOSERS who don't want him to lead. Americans had the  same problem when McCain and Romney allowed Obama to enter office. #fakenews
@LarrySabato @FaceTheNation No, he did not inflict any wound. He celebrated some part of black history (entertainment) at a party. Please! give it a rest. I'm glad to see the new poll showing this is pandering to guilty white liberals who have no other ideas, blacks aren't calling for resignation.
@brandondarby @TSA From what I recall they should not. I believe they have to remove any prosthetic and put it through the x-ray.  But no "groping" unless there is an unresolved alarm. Now yes, if you have titanium you'll get a pat-down. But no groping.
@NRO @jackrcrowe It's the ugly #fakenews and #poilicestate spectacle of imprisoning your political opponents. #AmyDearest and @TheDemocrats field must back off in the name of Liberty.
But I think @Pontifex can do some real good here, because sexual abuse is at the heart of a lot of evils, including abortion, as little humans are literally ripped apart because we can't learn to be human as created by God. https://t.co/Bv2vHmc3Cy
@thehill @RobLowe I think @TheDemocrats field is too many chiefs, not enough Indians. @potus. And now we have #AmyDearest joining the frozen mix.
@washingtonpost The dry-cleaning bill though...
@tomhfh @guypbenson This shows the need for 1st Amendment type Freedom of Expression on @twitter. It raises an issue of government dictatorship of thought and how it can be abused.
@WashTimes The painting looks surprisingly good. The rock looks like a grinning Cheshire cat, though. I conclude we must be humbled by the thought that great talent misapplied can lead to such disastrous mistakes and consequences.
@mathieuvonrohr Nein, nicht verstehen. Dass ist nicht eine gute idee. However, I have discovered Google can quickly correct your German grammar, allowing cross-language social media. Ending life together ist keine gute idee.
@PrisonPlanet What would #CharlesDickens say? We absolutely NEED our 1st Amendment to protect us from the edicts of government proclamations such as Life is Death and Man is Woman. We need Freedom of Conscience that @GREATBritain simply does not have.

@PatrickBuchanan #genderquotas that cap men home and block them from participation and voting in nominating candidates for U.S. President. Learn about it. Write about it.
@cspanwj From #MinnesotaNice to #AmyDearest Klobuchar.
As #WalterMondale passes the torch to his #genderquota winner @SenAmyKlobuchar it marks the transformation from #MinnesotaNice to #AmyDearest. Will the nation embrace a bad actor with binders full of women? Or will we choose to #MAGA? @StarTribune @duluthnews @MinnesotaDFL #kstp
@LarrySabato None of the people you're talking about created the social relations of slavery. If they're harassing anyone they should be stopped. But you can't criminalize yearbooks. Period.
@CBSNews https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A #fightlikeagirl
@thehill It was a great performance. Compassionate, caring. @fbi
@PJMedia_com @SenWarren @KamalaHarris @jtLOL No @amyklobuchar is going to knock everybody around. Throw binders at 'em.
@ericmwalker @SenCoryGardner Eric you first need to be honest about what period of time in Germany you're talking about. Read Berlin Diaries.
@rolandsmartin First @JacksonLeeTX18 I do accept it. Secondly, his point was he only agreed to five-minute rounds. He's right, You're wrong. Get a life.
@PrisonPlanet What's involved is sin.
@SenSanders @vets4bernie Don't play with the border Bernie
@AP_Politics @colvinj Fact check: @potus does NOT do this.
@justicedems @vets4bernie @AOC https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A #FightLikeaGirl
@mathieuvonrohr Well there are great journalists and lousy journalists. It/s difficult to measure exactly but it could be objectively measured. #fakenews is bad journalism and harmful to society. They have a lock on some revenue channels, though, currently.
@TinaSmithMN I'm primarying you in #Election2020. This is one of my voters. Do you believe this person is actually smiling? Happy? Asking for a friend. @SenTinaSmith @amyklobuchar @MinnesotaDFL https://t.co/PldlEPr5uj

@carolmswain Carol would it be necessary that @RalphNortham read Roots a work of fiction to be educated?
@RealCandaceO @USATODAY @ChelseaClinton #fakenews like @USATODAY always writes this garbage.

This is telling. https://t.co/omLkOPOZMc
@K_JeanPierre @tedlieu Idiotic.
@AsteadWesley So he needs to read a work of fiction? See this is all African American Studies has to offer and it's pitiful. University should pass my cultural pluralism requirement @amyklobuchar
@DonaldJTrumpJr That's exactly right Don. @amyklobuchar can't you see that you can't support #OpenBorders and pretend to be for #gunsecurity?
@hardball @RepSwalwell Just so he wasn't wearing a #MAGA. Hat or hanging out with @KellyannePolls right centrist @amyklobuchar?
@RepJayapal @MotherJones And that was nice of him. But you still don't have enough passion to actually heal the #border and that is a pity. @amyklobuchar @SpeakerPelosi
Of course the @washingtonpost would blame @realDonaldTrump for @AOC https://t.co/HZAPSC5rlu
@JerryDunleavy @RealCandaceO That's 1940. What about 1934?
@washingtonpost That rape is evil. Not that I expect WaPo to learn ANYTHING because they never have, a font of ignorance.
@DavidMDrucker You're not clear-eyed if you think you're clear-eyed about "foreign policy." You don't understand how the world "fits together."
@rolandsmartin Show me either @rolandsmartin @thecjpearson where she "misspoke" on Hitler. I listened to the statement. You don't know European history. Read Williliam Shirer Berlin Diaries and then talk to me.
@RepSylviaGarcia @RepJayapal @HouseJudiciary No. He said @realDonaldTrump followed the LAW. Which you refused to do. Why, lawmaker?
@LatPoliticalAve @MSNBC LOL @tedlieu @SpeakerPelosi stay away remember.
@JackPosobiec @GaetaSusan So this is good @stranahan. So let's see, who else needs to confirm this? #RobertMueller? @RepAdamSchiff?
@RepJayapal You don't have ANY passion or you'd try to fix the border, which you  are NOT. I on the other hand am. Find out how.
@soledadobrien So let's have a history test, Soledad. Was there ever a year during  which Hitler just tried to "build" Germany? What years? @RealCandaceO
@RepBarbaraLee This falls in the category of "I don't know what you said, but I dig the way you said it."
@RepBarbaraLee James Baldwin was an advocate of ignorance. Set back black thinking  decades.
@RepJeffries LOL.
@Mediaite Maybe this is why @BrettKavanaugh asked her about her own drinking. https://t.co/HckxEAWRQE
@libbycwatson @amyklobuchar used to sneer at me and Chicano leaders at @UMNews @UMNCLAStudents @umncla. Ray Roybal used to accusing her of mugging us as all the white students were sitting around with the white @mndailynews attacking us for trying to get elected.
@mtredden @aterkel @amyklobuchar won't debate and is not worthy of the nomination.
@BostonGlobe @SincerelyJenee It is okay. @cindymccain However Cindy should  work out some kind of protocol. Probably she did the right thing.
@ZekeJMiller @HotlineJosh @AP It's only a motion for injunction.
@daveweigel @dandrezner And now @keithellison is in Minnesota gleefully getting at "nasty" women by cancelling low-income women from their #breastcancer treatment insurance! (Hands off @alfranken!). Only  women are dying from Ellison's latest capers.
@yidwithlid @AHMalcolm Leaker in chief @stranahan?
@thehill #ChrisWallace is kind of a goofball
@carolmswain Maybe because they didn't sexually assault anyone?
So @amyklobuchar voted with @IlhanMN against Israel. Figures. "Centrist" you know. https://t.co/X7rzvNEyHk

@bradheath @maggieNYT Seems to me you are describing a LAW and not a policy. Can you see the difference? Or nah?
@washingtonpost Well, WaPo, let's look at history. During what years could Hitler have been trying to build up Germany? Pick some years? 1934? @RealCandaceO

@thehill I guess @RepJeffries. smh
@thehill @TheDemocrats are jerks. I'm guessing that moron @tedlieu let me see.
@stranahan @FoxNews Most Americans do not believe Ukraine has any jurisdiction over U.S. elections. I doubt even #robertmueller would accept it as material.
@thehill No.
@Philip_Elliott I have a few things to mention to @TerryMcAuliffe but this is @twitter. So I would say  disregard his self-serving advice.
@thehill I support you @KellyannePolls thank you for your courage and your wisdom and may God bless you!
@politico No fair using magic @HowardSchultz
@SpeakerPelosi @BennieGThompson @RepBarbaraLee Unfortunately @RepBarbaraLee is trippin'. How many support abortion on demand? You simply cannot rely on any single race, but on  GOD (you know, God History Month, or Year). Not you. Listen to God and he will continue to bless you. Worthip your flesh and you will fail with it.
@_waleedshahid @vets4bernie I disagree with Ronald Reagan on this.
@APCentralRegion @AP It's flattery by great entertainers, NOT disrespect. So people can take it that way if they insist but they can't pretend to know the artists' motives. I say they are wrong.
@thehill He beat @amyklobuchar but then Amy's in holding pattern until boom island! (((yay)))
@hasanthehun @vets4bernie So she said he had a right to be nationalist but not extend his dreams for spreading his ideas all over the world. This is not out of date @RealCandaceO because it also applies to Communism and Islamic fascism as well. @Ilhan
@BrettArends @HotlineJosh Today, the majority of blacks will do anything to take over the government and promote reconstruction. This is wrong and undemocratic. It must be strongly opposed. Also that moron @Comey's idea to tear down statues all over the South--oppose! @amyklobuchar
Excellent news! https://t.co/pXPtynvy0w

@juliaioffe @keithellison cancels #breastcancer patients coverage during treatment denies required hearing. How is this different?
@CAPAction @tedlieu Dumb question correct answer.
@maziehirono You're cancelling the #breastcancer treatment coverage of women in the government mortality prevention program. Refute that one. Ask @amyklobuchar she knows.
@JoeNBC @AOC @AOC @Ilhan @RepRashida and so forth. Crazytown. Full. Stop.
@soledadobrien How is it a "race-based" scam? Why not just a scam, if it is?
@AaronBlake Oh, poor Aaron! How can you survive such behavior!?
@AdamSchiff So @RepAdamSchiff do you deny you met with #FusionGPS personnel in Aspen? Are you pushing the GPS and Steele dossiers for them? So what is your response to @stranahan assertion that Ukraine has determined others interfered in our election? Ukrainians? Or don't you care about that
@JakeSherman Not really. A lot of chairs are just in dividing time. Or setting the agenda. So, bare your teeth @RepJerryNadler get all excited.  You are turning people off.
@DavidAFrench It's not decent to mix Germany and Virginia, David. What's wrong with you? Are you trained to be "spiritual" but not to  think rationally?
@WalshFreedom @Ilhan is from a country will no stable government and no free market, a very rudimentary economy, subject to socialistic and communalistic tendencies. Doesn't understand or really represent Minnesota.
@tedlieu You must have a safe seat, Ted. Pathetic.
@SenWarren Ready to kill human fetuses, I know. So you can generate votes.
@scottwongDC That's right. These clowns like @RepSwalwell @RepJerryNadler are running @TheDemocrats right out of  the  @HouseFloor in #Election2020
@soledadobrien Well, you defend deceit and evil, @soledadobrien. So I don't know what kind of "thoughts and prayers" you  think you have right now. I think you're attacking @KellyannePolls and that doesn't make me think very much of you.
@AaronBlake Your low intelligence is showing -- again.
Let me repeat for new @keithellison attorneys I met two. You think Schweiker v. Hogan 1982 USSC allows you to take the 1396a(aa) #breastcancer funds away from cancer patients and use them on other county priorities saying you help "most impoverished". These low-income ARE that...
@stranahan I have two twitter lists one 1300 and one 600 these are where I see you. I'm not controlled by any opposition media. I'm active not passive. As you may know I got a lot of votes for @USSenate throughout the state. I'm watching very closely. Ex-USAFSS
@SusanGKomen Let's not get racist in any way okay?  We got black bureaucrats at @RamseyCounty in charge of Mexicans okay? Stop being race about it and fight the #WaronCancer. Also too much secrecy about this. I'm from @AmericanCancer as resource specialist.
@SusanGKomen So listen very carefully, these women can many of them get on NBCCEDP screening and then BCCPTA treatment. ARE? THEY? And then people like @keithellison and @GovTimWalz throw  them off for no reason and if they don't due in 10 days with grounds they lose it. Look at low-income pl
@stranahan I don't think it will say that @comey has some meaningful role in their work. Of course everybody wants to know.
@stranahan May be meaningful. You say no. I want more. What was the conference about? That kind of thing. I didn't get distracted. I brought it up with you. I also watch @JudicialWatch and I want substantive stuff to mainstream. We all know the Clinton's are being ignored.
@stranahan Well, I'm not "totally ignorant", I gather information that's why I look at your tweets and many others. As I said, if tied into the U.S. political terrain highly relevant. I don't have @FoxNews and I complain about them. But I need to focus. And move forward tracking @potus.
@libertyanfree @stranahan @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Ok, I listened to this. First of all, we don't rely on the Ukraine  government and findings. It needs to be tied in with U.S. machinery of govt. @RepAdamSchiff is the hater in charge. Now we know he met with #FusionGPS. And you say @comey is tied to NABU, so show that. Ofc where?
@stranahan Sure, you know they're cancelling #BCCPTA treatment coverage while the women are in active cancer treatment, Okay. Well @AdamSchiff @RepAdamSchiff has a hard-on to bring down Trump. He's in the assembly, meeting with #FusionGPS. But ok.
@stranahan Okay, then you know that the other side, in factions, often throws all principle, all policy issues aside and simply plot to gain this or that limited outcome for themselves. Here there is a #coupattempt to overthrow our #election2016. You see @KellyannePolls beaten to STOP 2016
@libertyanfree @stranahan @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Okay Lee I'm running around to #MNAG and @MNCourts trying to save women's lives as government cancels their #breastcancer treatment coverage before they complete their prescribed treatment. But it is big that @RepAdamSchiff was colluding with #FusionGPS is it not? Of course deep
@bunionbutt Further @keithellison believes that for women admitted into the #MABC life-saving #breastcancer treatment program, if they age alive to 65 years of age in treatment, their #BCCPTA is automatically cancelled. It kills women and impact study is required. I know one death personally
@bunionbutt Let me be clear on @keithellison position. @MNcounties can cancel #MABC for any reason they choose and if you don't appeal in 10 datys with request to continue benefits on appeal you never get them back. No one has challenged it in court but us. But we are in @MNCourts further..
@thehill #RobertMueller is a disgusting waste of time and disgraceful attack on democracy by partisan thugs like @amyklobuchar who wants to be president in #election2020.
@CharlieCookDC Think of how saddening it is when women in #breastcancer treatment under government health care insurance administered by @keithellison pass because the government CANCELS coverage while they're in treatment. Talk about this. #BCCPTA #MABC Meaningful benefits.l
Met with new attorney of @keithellison replacing "Tiger" Brett Terry. Just asking for comity. No. So @GovTimWalz, Ellison, @TonyLourey have not changed their position, still are cancelling all #MABC recipients' #breastcancer treatment coverage even if it kills them. @StarTribune
@NPR Well, I'm sure @TheDemocrats like @amyklobuchar get all giddy and excited over this kind of thing. They're leaving #ThePeople behind...
@stranahan Ever been in politics, Lee? You think it's all about the debate on the floor of the assembly?
@stranahan @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Oh, #FusionGPS? @RepAdamSchiff with them is FAR more relevant.
@stranahan @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Why would he talk about "Leschenko"?
@theblaze Many women are tremendously immature about politics. Oh, if we talk about their personal experience they're all ears. But maintaining a stable government, they're not interested and think they can blow up like teenagers.
@politico It is a ridiculous attack. It would be great if someone could get #fakenews, mindless liberals and neurotic black people to drop it and get serious about government.
@stranahan If this is true abotu @RepAdamSchiff it really is important, Lee. Is it true?
@jonswaine @maggieNYT I'm sure you love to read junk like this Maggie. Helps explain why you're so messed up and unreadable.
@thehill And that is true. And you keep talking like only @realDonaldTrump cares about this, and you're having some political contest. But I have ZERO, zero respect for what @dnc and people like @HillaryClinton and her low-life associates are doing. Including @BarackObama.
@BHsciacca @bostonherald @Marisa_Ingemi Yeah don't pretend to be men and you'll be alright.
@whitneyjstuart @madirishfrog Oh, I see, campaigning for @SenSanders. Alright, well put me down with the 20% who don't think "politics" means digging through old yearbooks. Or threatening Catholic boys going to a #RightToLife march.
@washingtonpost I believe that. This is the kind of thing @amyklobuchar and her friends stir up. Being a "centrist" but she loves to get involved in the extremes. @KellyannePolls is a centrist, Amy, there's a good example for you.
@BradMossEsq And you are....? Oh, a lawyer. This is how lawyers enjoy themselves? I always wondered about that.
@whitneyjstuart @madirishfrog I don't wear black face. But making rules about what you can do with your face is not the answer (although in your case...), or telling everybody to resign because you  feel like it.
@politico If you and your ignorant hacks, @politico do not come up with a #fairdeal @realDonaldTrump will not sign it. You are professional losers and liars.
See this is @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN @MinnesotaDFL #OpenBorders ideology. And @SpeakerPelosi. I don't follow this women's leadership. You shouldn't either. https://t.co/L3qmXxcXsi
@washingtonpost It's not America's "original sin". African slavery and selling your neighbor into slavery began in Africa. European servitude also began in Europe. You'll continue to lie away unhelpfully.
@CBSNews @SenSchumer here is the negotiations, Mr. Minority Man: IF he gets a #fairdeal HE (that's him, in the negotiations) signs it. Otherwise YOU have another #schumerpelosishutdown. And @potus will let you know as soon as he sees it, and we'll all KNOW if you've succeeded. Or. Not.
@politico Okay,  so here @SpeakerPelosi is saying her whole appearance at #SOTU2019 was a theatrical performance. That is what I thought, so....
@Ilhan is an example of how @GovMarkDayton and @MinnesotaDFL are promoting the ideology that targets and kills #Christians and other ideological rivals. But @potus has acted to eliminate this threat. @TheDemocrats like @amyklobuchar should BACK him not mindless oppose him. https://t.co/6VsMPblR3r
@NRO @RameshPonnuru Why I  don't read your publication. Baseless #NeverTrump
@washingtonpost No, obviously it is WHITE as fashion. Very often, almost always (show me exceptions) it is a fashion statement. So you say they make the statement because they feel secure in their right to say it. It could just be because it's a free country, not "supremacy". Blacks free, TOO.
@Trumpistas @henryolsenEPPC @Graniteprof @amyklobuchar You say this. But in FACT she has had the #genderquotas advantage because Henry Olsen types have been systematically excluded by the law on voting by gender, race, etc. Never debates. #Election2020 Not centrist just insipid. @SenAmyKlobuchar @MinnesotaDFL #wcco #kstp #kare11 #mpr
@TinaSmithMN You SAY this, @SenTinaSmith but then you and @E_J_Piper and @LoriSwansonMN came between hundreds of Minnesota women #breastcancer patients who decided to complete treatment under #MABC and you TERMINATED their treatment coverage! @amyklobuchar @keithellison @HHSGov @MNCourts #npr
@Ilhan @iSheyman You came as part of a program by the United States government. They are coming in violation of the laws of the United States government. THAT's the difference.
@henryolsenEPPC @Graniteprof @amyklobuchar is anything but savvy. Henry, no doubt, is ignorant of the fact that Klobuchar gets in by eliminating males from voting or participating in the nomination process. His column would be more worthy of consideration if he considered this.

@madirishfrog @whitneyjstuart I'm one of the 20% of whites who think what these people do is acceptable. Do not pass laws saying what white people can and cannot say or whether we can paint our faces or not. Blacks are not objective when describing white motives. Just. Stop.
@whitneyjstuart A lot more real than you are, sir.
@USATODAY Don't be stupid. @mattgaetz is not "switching the focus" to illegal immigration, gun violence is DIRECTLY GROWING OUT OF illegal immigration and an uncontrolled border.
@USATODAY No it doesn't mean that. The problem here is all these black people appointing themselves as experts on the motives of whites or non-blacks. They're not objective and they're just plain wrong.
@KatrinaPierson I agree they are like the KKK. They  violate U.S. Constitution to get "elected" and then just act ridiculous, and are destructive of our civil rights. They are stopping human progress and genociding. Abortion on demand of black and other babies worse than slavery!
@CBSNews @nancycordes They have no right to investigate the President. Turn over nothing. Just because they have no right.
@ryanobles @kathrynw5 I don't care. They're idiots. Work with your governor and stop killing your black babies. that's a FAR worse crime than slavery.
@theblaze I don't care. It looks fine. Again, @thejoybehar is trying to compliment black women. Give it a break. You're demeaning real discussion of racism.
@WashTimes No its isn't. They were trying to be like you. Don't be ridiculous @KurtisBlow1
@NYDailyNews I always wanted to do that!
@FreeBeacon @Aaron_Kliegman No, I agree with @TulsiGabbard that we are only hurting ourselves by making the removal of Assad a requirement for defeating ISIS and restoring normalcy to Syria. This stupidity by @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton is what CREATED ISIS. And that is unforgivable.
@seanhannity Wait, wait, wait @GovMarkDayton you are the education governor, correct? And so here is the woman you hand-picked to replace @keithellison and she's THREATENED these @CovingtonCatho2 students their "behavior has consequences"? @Ilhan is a disgrace! @MinnesotaDFL
@InteractiveMary @SenTinaSmith @53DFL @amyklobuchar Alright. If you want to unite the party, then work with me to pass legislation to treat #breastcancer screened under the low-income program without the 65-year-old age limit. No more throwing granny off the cliff. And I have a lot of other great ideas I'll bring up. Work with me
@PostOpinions @washingtonpost @Comey JAMES, @comey, HOW could you have missed all these terrible crimes!
@Tom_Winter @maggieNYT Why would I care about this?
@nytpolitics I don't care and it's not racist. You're ridiculous. You're confusing people about what real racism is.
@senatemajldr So you would include precinct caucuses then? Even for @TheDemocrats? Should they not be excluded by law or custom because they are a male and the number of males voting for "@amyklobuchar" are capped by @MinnesotaDFL? No all-white primaries for @GOP?
@FaceTheNation @KamalaHarris How they painted their faces in college is irrelevant. NON-issue being manipulated by seedy politicians.
@joelpollak @AOC Oh, wait so the Latins were native people. Right. Native to Italy.
@rolandsmartin @JerryFalwellJr Jerry Falwell is GREAT! Because he loves and preaches the Word of God.
@ElectProject Or...the @vademocrats and black government could take a hike.
@Eugene_Scott @rolandsmartin He doesn't perpetuate white supremacy.
@Newsweek They're not IN the U.S. government, DUH. Not elected officials. Shall I start going around wearing one?
@theblaze Unfortunately the issue now is the women can't be stopped from killing their babies, your baby. Yes men SHOULD do more
@thehill @DickDurbin @SenatorDurbin is a meathead, a dummkopf
@washingtonpost @TuckerCarlson is correct about @staceyabrams. I doubt he will discuss the racial and #genderquotas that exclude white men  from voting or participating though. Probably because he's been taught, relying on Anderson v. Celebrezze a case about INDEPENDENTS, not Republicans.
@WashTimes Oh, right, I get the Jimmy's mixed up. So it's Kimmel--Winfrey and Fallon--Rock. Kimmell--good. Fallon--good. Everybody else--bad.
@soledadobrien Condolences
@thehill I'm aware of a lot of prominent folks who appeared or performed in painted faces and I don't care. It's actually flattering black artists in most cases, including the two in Virginia. Personally I've never been interested in doing it. I don't condemn face painting
@rollcall So @RepMarciaFudge is backing a judge who actually killed his wife? And I thought I'D seen it all.
@CBSNews Try to be Americans here, boys. Forget your damned parties. @SenatorBurr @MarkWarner This is not a good look. There are the history books.
@JohnJHarwood @JoeConason Right with anti-American @BarackObama socialism, for instance his individual mandate oppression and death.
@BostonGlobe Okay, so Virginia is racist, alright. Boston says Virginia's racist. New history.
@RepMarkMeadows So you're telling us we will have another #shutdown2019 because they won't produce a #fairdeal? @SpeakerPelosi
@thehill Happy Birthday Roberta
@ChiTribEnt @chicagotribune @phillipstribune Liam Neeson not ugly semi-porn, thank you.
@washingtonpost Not even close to ludicrous, duh. If you want to talk about the birth certificate that is Obama's own fault for writing he was born in Kenya. But no one used the government and @FBI schmucks to undermine his pathetic presidency. What kind of people read your garbage anyway?
@markknoller @SenatorLankford @ChrisCoons I think @TheDemocrats has his eyes open.
@jameshohmann @dandrezner Trump is the man. You  guys are riff-raff.
@kathrynw5 I would read a comma in there. But then, I'm literate and you're #fakenews.
@mattcompton So what? How is that any of your business? If Americans are so stupid as to go with your "reasoning" the nation will be in trouble. Trust me, you're no rock star and America is REJECTING your stuff.
@NewsHour I'm not  speechless. I'm saying don't talk to me about face-painting, talk to me about some actual issues. @MinnesotaDFL
@abc_columbia Yep, this is what they do. Like snakes. @BobbyScott. @justinfairfax @RalphNortham
@davidfrum And there you have it some IDIOT translated it that way @kylegriffin1. Obviously there's a comma there. Why  I  pay either of you no attention.
@davidfrum I know you're SUCH a literati, David, but as written it's ambiguous and could mean abolition of civil rights. duh
@LevineJonathan @HotlineJosh I don't care. @thejoybehar
This is your "American" @amyklobuchar this is your "centrist" "candidacy". https://t.co/xQO4FHjEKE
@SebGorka These aren't Americans. @RepAdamSchiff @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @amyklobuchar are not  Americans. They're Dem totalitarians. Remember that. They think they're "new history" they're just the end of democracy. @TheDemocrats @DNC @MinnesotaDFL
@JasonCalvi @SebGorka @PattyMurray Why do I have to look at this person?
@mmurraypolitics @creynoldsnc No they did not. You are the essence of #fakenews Mark. And as the target of the IRS myself for political reasons, my candidacy, I really look down on you. You're dangerous. Obama would have been wailing if people had actually attacked him and his family.
@JessicaDurando @USATODAY Obviously it's not for humor, so this is another dumb argument, setting up a false conclusion with a false premise. @MorganStateU It's obviously a way to imitate black performers. It's flattery. Or @thejoybehar who wanted to be "beautiful." Stoop arguing about face-painting.
@WashTimes Don't care. @cindymccain did the right thing, but did not get the information from the police regarding what they did about it. The police never do, of course, ongoing investigation. Don't make this over "claims" and "refutes". You're only aiding crime @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN
@ABC @sean_wmur And of course he blames the train instead of his own negligence.
@thehill And so what is your point, @chuckschumer? You think this is a big game? Score political points and win a prize? This is leadership to you? You feel bad because @AmbassadorRice was saying after @BarackObama we'll just have to "accept it" like white people have nukes (Russia?)?
@FT Ah yes, unlawful merging.
@NYDailyNews Pretend you are a serious newspaper. Are you saying if she feels something isn't right she should stay silent? Or is it just that she should follow up privately with the police before speaking publicly about it? And should the police talk to her about investigation? @cindymccain
@cindymccain I appreciate your diligence. I agree with you, "if you see something, say something." This is why @realDonaldTrump is right. We need a secure border. Maybe you should see if you can ride with border patrol sometime to look at this. @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN #humantrafficking
@SaraCarterDC @AOC You shouldn't even be in Congress except for @JoeCrowleyNY dociley accepting the exclusion of FREE MEN from the #fakeelection "nominations" of a majority women like  the #genderquota ("centrist") queen @amyklobuchar and appointees @TinaSmithMN @Ilhan
@carolmswain See I agree with this. Most blacks are not artists, but yes, artists should be honored by the imitation. And there's sometime vitriol because someone else is getting paid for appropriating ideas. NO reason to bring down the government.
@amyklobuchar your time as "prosecutor" is OVER. https://t.co/lkXVWGIeHU
@thehill That's right, stop the face-painting games.
@SenSchumer Lying. @SenSchumer
@TinaSmithMN @realDonaldTrump With someone else's body yes.
@ChelseaClinton Don't argue with me about face painting.
@LarrySabato Up to voters
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @SenSanders If you you think you're so smart buy the company.
@RepAdamSchiff You're crazy @RepAdamSchiff
@LouDobbs @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump Ok so Rep Jordan let's get that information public about the FISA court issues.
@thehill It won't. The @realDonaldTrump #TheWall will not stop any butterly travel. As long as they fly higher than 20 feet in the air.
@Newsweek Right. Standing up. Not kneeling down.
@SenSanders @staceyabrams Just for one point, @realDonaldTrump building a wall does NOT "abandon our people." That's ridiculous. So tell me @staceyabrams how that "abandons our people"?
@SenSanders @staceyabrams She is a terrible speaker and I would  debate her anytime.
@washingtonpost That is 100% false. In fact, #Obamacare cannibalizes SAGE and the Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention  and Treatment, a health disparities program @potus COULD model this early intervention program on, because @keithellison says they can't guarantee meaningful benefits 2 pttnts
So @SenSchumer and @amyklobuchar hammering "unity without  specifics". Why do we need to have "specifics" to have unity?
@brithume @RichLowry Yeah, I guess she'll stay in the senate seat and run for president to boot.
@brithume @RichLowry So put me in that 30% category. So with @amyklobuchar possibly running for president, I wonder if we'd have two @ussenate seats up for re-election again in 2020? So maybe she won't give up her Senate seat...
@RepTimRyan @rolandsmartin No, he doesn't "know it better". Besides it's a national thing.
@McCormickProf Roy Moore was obviously falsely accused and did nothing like this guy.
@RepGregoryMeeks Right. But that's not what the @NAACP is doing today. Today they are not helping anybody. They support a core of unreasonable, self-serving @TheDemocrats politicians. They don't talk with anybody they talk at people.
So this seems to be a new use of @twitter. https://t.co/gQ0Tbq4Teh
@TheDemocrats A lot of us will fight you, @RepBarbaraLee. smh Everybody's got choices but abortion on demand is not one of those choices.
@Redistrict @dandrezner So where do you buy that stuff? It seems like it really works for you.
@DailySignal I think we need to late-term abort these ladies in white in #Election2020
@rollcall No way. Idiots. Violates separation of powers. Goof balls.
So I've reviewed the context of the #PelosiClap and I think it is good. Compromise, common good all of that. Fine. @POTUS accepted it with a nod of approval and I do too.
@Acosta Fact check Jim. No, Pompeo is right. Your confusion notwithstanding. He is not downplaying the threat. BTW dude this is classified. Nothing you say can be taken as significant. The same kind of #fakenews you do.
@CillizzaCNN No it isn't. No one cares how you paint your face. Go ahead and paint yours, Chris.
@thehill Oh you mean warmongers like @HillaryClinton and @amyklobuchar. They should go fight the wars they love so much  themselves. as we try to get the nukes under control. Just the time we need dizzy appointees like @Ilhan representing Minneapolis.
@Philip_Elliott Yeah, but it's not.
@LarrySabato @UVA Face painting is not an issue. Was it ever banned at any of these schools? No. Because they're not bothering anybody. If you want to make it a crime, go ahead. This is ridiculous. What's the polling on this?
@OversightDems @RepCummings What a liar. Except white men, of course.
@ForecasterEnten @llcdillon She's totally protected by a party and Minnesota LAWS that prevent men from participating while she is crowned as fake #genderquota queen.
@SincerelyJenee @JamesPindell @NestorARamos Just let them ride the bus.
@FeliciaWongRI @KatrinaNation Most of the stuff #fdr said was not solid. He was very partisan and trying to deal with an unprecedented crisis. He never did. World War changed the situation, not his words.
@GuthrieGF Don't  care how you feel.
@DWStweets Yeah, yeah, everybody's racist I know. You're so smart. Ever wear blackface?
@DrDenaGrayson @rolandsmartin And @TheDemocrats expect us to vote for these people?? Nah.
@TexasTribune @rolandsmartin No, wait you're lying. He said it's the safest place in America because the wall works. Why do you constantly lie? You should see a shrink.
@TheRickWilson @rolandsmartin @potus is correct and you are going to be sinking in the polls. That's why none of your candidates will admit they're trying to impeach.
@RepAnnieKuster @realDonaldTrump @RepBonamici @RepCheri @NydiaVelazquez @RepMarcyKaptur @LeaderHoyer @RepSpanberger @RepSherrill A power message to put a stop to #genderquotas that prevent men from voting to "nominate" these people for federal office. #fakeelections
@peterbakernyt @jmartNYT I don't care how people paint their faces. But keep writing.
This is why I don't want blacks governing. Because you are basically dictatorial and just want a list of triggers to use the government against whit e people, anything that advances your desires. There is nothing wrong with dark makeup, give it up and get a life. Need new directn
@thedailybeast Interestingly in 1980 I was getting in trouble with @amyklobuchar friends at @UMNews because we dressed up as Gophers wearing South African-themed messages for Homecoming 1980. Eventually they threw me out of college. I guess we all do things that get us in  trouble.
@mitchellreports Right, Leon the brainiac. Well, what's dangerous for the world is YOU and your buddies giving Iran nukes for votes, and everybody else getting nuclear weapons. And China not in the existing treaty. YOU need to get serious, Panetta and stop trying to destabilize the government.
@HotlineJosh Hey we can have blackface Kabuki theater! A whole new political genre, or gender or whatever. This is ridiculous. #fakenews
@scottwongDC Shouldn't it be "chaos darkens"?
@RichLowry So did he sic his private eyes on Herring?
@jonallendc @FreeBeacon @NBCNews @GeoffRBennett Well I guess that's a strong argument for him. So if he says "F that B" then that proves he would never....never mind.
@maggieNYT Well, I was close with "B". Had not got to "F" yet smh...
@RichLowry So did it start with "B"? Or what exactly?
@AaronBlake @RalphNortham won't resign, give it up.
@ArthurSchwartz I think it's pretty self-evident @RalphNortham is not going to resign for this hogwash.
@bostonherald Pretty inane stuff by Herring. He dressed up for THIS? @KurtisBlow1. Headed to China, he's "rapping" to funk in the video I saw "The breaks". So I was playing this stuff in 1970s with Pitiful Souls in Taiwan. He should play "Kung Fu Fighting" the Chinese like that.
@KatrinaNation @thenation No it isn't you nitwit
@duluthnews Well, I think this means @SenAmyKlobuchar is preparing to vote in @USSenate on the #fairdeal to avert the #shutdown2019. Because otherwise she can kiss her AFA good-bye.
@NikkiKARE11 @kare11 @janashortal She needs to #fightlikeagirl That's my take. https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A
@allahpundit @JoeNBC Well, if you stop and think. WHEN and if you start thinking, you'll realize their have 10 days to pass a new CR and fund the border wall. So there's a CERTAIN logic to this IF you have any, which you don't. You don't care if there's a #shutdown2019
@thehill Whatever
@WashTimes Which raises the question, @aoc why ARE you there? Because of some dummy named @JoeCrowleyNY who still doesn't admit he had to convince delegates who were mostly women and minorities BY LAW. And @WashTimes also never mentions this. Why?
@gatewaypundit @IlhanMN She was just acting out the whole speech. Very embarrassing and I blame @GovMarkDayton. He doesn't get a D for this he gets an "F".
@DavidMDrucker @realDonaldTrump It's rally #maga. Not just for himself. That's your loopy assumption.
@politico Oh. Playin' hard to get, huh?
@brithume @NRO It could only be to LITERALLY legalize murder. Killing people already born and not excluded by any  idiotic @USSupremeCourt precedents, super-dooper-loopers
@thefix @washingtonpost @TheDemocrats need to grow up. What a bunch of  ridiculous losers.
@CBSNews Probably past his bedtime, has to get up for school today. Plus all the excitement and things he didn't understand. A choir of devils dressed in white dresses pretending to be angels. @amyklobuchar in purple garb staring intently....Plus @potus soothing voice....
@seattletimes Unconstitutional #genderquotas
@scottwongDC @RepAnnieKuster He was "ticked off"?
"Long history of bigotry of Ameican medicine." So 'splain this. https://t.co/NUCkif1aYL
@RebeccaRKaplan @kathrynw5 @RepJeffries Right, but @CoryBooker disagrees. What does @KamalaHarris or @amyklobuchar say?
@kathrynw5 A White House reporter should know @HillaryClinton @BarackObama initiated an attack on Assad saying they'd overthrow him, before he had done any of these things. The blood is on Hillary's hands. Worst SOS in history.
@pbolyard @PJMedia_com It is true they are monsters. @amyklobuchar smirked evilly while human trafficking, I believe, was described. She calls herself a centrist. So anything that happens they just calculate the political implications for them, not the issue itself.
@Newsweek Stupid comparison by @staceyabrams creating what makes America stronger and then makes a useless conclusion. Walls are not supposed to make America stronger. Immigration can make America stronger. Ignorant people  would listen to her and be swayed. I am not.
@mikedebonis @scottwongDC @SpeakerPelosi @SpeakerPelosi will keep messing around....They'll  get rid of her pretty soon.
@philipaklein Why was she making a video?
@42tribez @rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrump LOL. So Joseph wasn't sent to slavery by his brothers? They  didn't build the pyramids for the pharoahs with slave labor? You have a lie for everything don't you?
@rollcall She's not "centrist". LOL
@ThisWeekABC It is the same thing, you are calling for compassionate #OpenBorders @staceyabrams. And of course the border patrol are professional and compassionate. YOU want them to be welcomed in and not show for hearing and go AWOL. Dumb speech.
@thehill It would probably be a lot like going to church. Wondering what all the grown-up excitement was about. He feels safe and secure, and can rest.,
@thehill A natural reaction for most kids.
@FaceTheNation @SpeakerPelosi Right, but no gun violence on the border, is that what you're saying, Nancy? Do you not see the country will be safer with a secure border? So you're being argumentative here. I RARELY listen to your ideas because you're so partisan and dishonest.
@washingtonpost So why should he have let this idiot @SpeakerPelosi "introduce him"? I think she helped raise his approval by giving him more time to get together a GREAT #SOTU2019
@thehill Let ME be clear, @staceyabrams you know that you suppress white male voting in nominations by eliminating their votes and participation with #genderquotas, race quotas on and on. #ysos?
Okay, so this is what I'm talking about, let the @USSenate come up with their deal. Then the @POTUS will act. https://t.co/Ie1tCOHlAq
How can @esmemurphy pretend to talk about "unity" when Abrams calls the border issue "a stunt"? #ysos means "you stupid or something"?
@thehill Well, actually @SenGillibrand, @POTUS the @DNC demands stiff #genderquotas which "cap" men  at 50%, and then you have your race, religion, homosexuality and nationality quotas. So it's really the gender quotas, not "Democratic women" who create those jobs? Admit it?
@stranahan @POTUS Troops?
@washingtonpost @GovMarkDayton thinks @Ilhan is doing a great job. Dayton, worst governor in Minnesota history.
@nahaltoosi @dandrezner At this point I'm not interested in your thoughts because you've been acting like a kid.
@thehill No, @SenSanders, @staceyabrams is living a lie. We all know that the border issue all @TheDemocrats have ignored for many decades is not a "stunt". So right away she's not worth listening to.
@JoeConason Actually, and I don't even expect @DonaldJTrumpJr to discuss this, those women benefitted as Joe knoiws very well, from #genderquotas that exclude men from nominating for @TheDemocrats in federal office or for president. #genderquotas. Pretend they don't exist, Joe.
@KindeandTrue @stranahan @POTUS So you mean infrastructure, and eradicating HIV. And a border wall, you prefer #OpenBorders. See you need to get serious IMHO.
@KindeandTrue @stranahan @POTUS They already repealed #ObamaCare
@RepAnnieKuster You're celebrating #genderquotas that violate the 19th Am. by capping men excluding their votes. How are you surprised that the result is all women? This needs toi be exposed and corrected.
@amyklobuchar @staceyabrams She was just loud and insulting, and she used her dad to pretend America has to be rescued from the very excellent @realDonaldTrump. No, @SenAmyKlobuchar it is NOT a stunt you moron to protect Americans away from the #OpenBorders you support.
So obviously, @SenAmyKlobuchar is running for #Election2020 #presidentialelection because she's inviting people to attend. I won't be supporting her. I don't expect she'll have the honesty to tell @potus that she excludes men from nominating @USSenate candidates. #FakeNews either https://t.co/RdC6AhnpRe
@kylegriffin1 @JoyAnnReid Well, except that James @Comey deliberately interfered in blocking the facts, and in fact obstructed justice. As did @BarackObama and @HillaryClinton
@JoyAnnReid I think you are going to find that @bobschrum is way off on this one. It was simply a great speech. Another big thanks to @realDonaldTrump for his leadership. Carry on.
@scottwongDC Scott, you seem to think you're a big reporter, but you know you suppress the truth of the #genderquotas in picking up all these safe-seat districts for these women strictly based on gender and unconstitutonal election laws. But hey it's a living for you isn't it?
Yes https://t.co/CAOEDMwCjl
@CBSNews Good. @SpeakerPelosi has NOTHING to add. @potus came into her little "@HouseFloor" and owned it. But if she wants to be useful, we'll see what she's got.
@rolandsmartin @AOC @aoc should get off the stage.
@ABC @rolandsmartin I would seriously like to ask if @staceyabrams is doing anything for school safety, at all? Or is she just attacking the @NRA, this kind of thing?
@thehill You think this is funny, @SenSchumer? America hates how you are aborting our children.
@FenitN @rolandsmartin We're not your slaves, Roland. Can't you ever think except in terms of enslaving peoiple?
@scottwongDC So @SenShelby here's where I think you have this wrong (and @senatemajldr). Just get a deal. @potus is not there to use his #SOTU19 to help you do your work. You had your 3 weeks as @LindseyGrahamSC asked. Now get your deal. Then Trump will act.
@gwlauren @rolandsmartin @staceyabrams Her "speech" was a stunt and doesn't lead anywhere.
Wow! https://t.co/750LQdXXSx
@samswey @rolandsmartin I liked what he said about defending civilization. Seemed to be support for @SteveKingIA. I mean I actually liked it, and it's good for you, too, even though you're totally uinaware of it.
@politico It was not zig-zag. You're simply illiterate.
@VanJones68 Van, I have to say, your lack intelligence entirely. Your politics is a mess. And no, I don't follow you.
@_SJPeace_ @VanJones68 They have great musicians in the Philippines.
@thehill She will stand aside as Minnesotans vote her out in #Election2020 @Ilhan
I don't spend a lot of time reading through all the articles, but from @Twitter feed view, @cnnee appears to be a better, more balanced source of news than @washingtonpost or @nytimes, etc. They have their own news unlike @StarTribune for example. https://t.co/bLhggOnE9h
@washingtonpost I think it is you who is blundering, @washingtonpost
@washingtonpost @databyler Your publicaiton is unworthy
@NewsHour @gretchenfrazee Your program is unworthy
@politico @SenAmyKlobuchar won't run. It didn't work out.
@bpolitics @SpeakerPelosi is....not wise
@alfranken What a JOKE you are, Franken. Do you actually believe you are educated? Because "Harvard"? Yes, I can imagine you think you "study" because you read this novel. You might be that stupid, but Minnesotans are WAY smarter than you. Return to New York.
@42tribez @rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrump I'm sorry, you think the argument is when slavery was INVENTED? So how about Joseph being sold to Egyptian slavery? Way before Rome. Seriously, I know what I'm talking about. It's not about race. It's about civilization.
@wheres_ally2016 @BBC Have you actually read his work? I have. Are you familiar with his semiotics? @noamchomskyT said he is the "pre-eminent" American philosopher. His side would be philosophical. Phenomenological side of it. Because of him the potential of computers is far more than you realize.
@CBSNews I'm very disappointed by @staceyabrams inability to think. A mind is a terrible thing to waste and she's an example.
@WhipClyburn Good old @JimClyburnSC keeps on lyin' about the gender and race quotas which pointedly exclude white men from nominating for office. Then he struts around like a wise man.
@ThisWeekABC No we didn't stumble @staceyabrams you stumbled in your arrogant speech.
@TeamPelosi @WeAreWomanUS Voter suppression is when the @dnc in EVERY STATE caps white male participation at about FORTY PERCENT of voting delegates. And then @staceyabrams and @SpeakerPelosi LIE about it and #fakenews never admits it. Violates 15th, 19th Amendments then they cheer. smh
@jaketapper @HotlineJosh @staceyabrams Abrams is the most self-righteous person I've heard in a long time.
@jaketapper @HotlineJosh @staceyabrams It was terrible.
@rolandsmartin @staceyabrams Did not appreciate her work. Sure she cares about cancer treatment for her own father. But no one else.
@PeterHamby @DavidMDrucker She is just a hater. Posing as full of love, but not....
@NewsHour @staceyabrams What an ugly liar.
I see why @staceyabrams lost.
@staceyabrams IS a racist. Difficult to listen to her.
@staceyabrams says "you can't defer cancer treatment." OH, but said @E_J_Piper @LoriSwansonMN @amyklobuchar yes you CAN! Kicking women off #breastcancer treatment coverage or MA-BC. https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A @keithellison @GovTimWalz @TonyLourey
@staceyabrams honors her profession--she's a GREAT liar!
Lousy, disjointed speech by @staceyabrams for @TheDemocrats. Badly written.
@staceyabrams is proving big time to be an idiot.
This is the @Twitter @POTUS and speaks most powerfully when he speaks directly to the American people.
Great #SOTU2019!
@rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrump Man, what a hater, Roland.
@Newsweek I probably should not comment on @realBobWoodward low level intelligence at this point.
@llcdillon @iliza Some people are perpetual idiots.
@KamalaHarris @WeAreWomanUS We're all human, @KamalaHarris, not just women. We all have bodies. You are killing us through abortion because of your selfishness.
@NYDailyNews And they should have.
Yes! sounds like a Trump rally. #MAGA! https://t.co/4qybRG7lAS
@rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrump You started slavery of each other in Africa, with Muslim slave trade.
@MariaTCardona @POTUS Many of the aborted children are black. Oh, and also brown. He is fighting for them. YOU are not
@MariaTCardona @POTUS Colombian who loves to kill Americans by aborting them.
@sarahsophief @creynoldsnc Hey, we're ALL human. Not you though.
@vanitaguptaCR @rolandsmartin No, because of #genderquotas unconstitutiolnally excluded males. Don't lie to me, I know.
@benwikler @rolandsmartin Another one not honest enough to admits @TheDemocrats use unconstitutonal #genderquotas against white men.
@BostonGlobe BUT they do it through #genderquotas, which you never admit.
@JonLemire @JoyAnnReid Of course they love themselves.
@JoeNBC Steven Rattner, yeah, he's the one who destroyed Ford. Real good, Steve. @SteveRattner
@christinawilkie @rolandsmartin Hey if they actually had anything to contribute, people would listen to them. Not stupidity though.
@dandrezner He seems to be whoopin' you Dan.. Somebody do something!
@42tribez @rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrump Ottoman empire.
@42tribez @rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrump They did.
@RepRaulGrijalva Please don't lie while he is speaking, Raul.
@JoyAnnReid @SpeakerPelosi is a fraud.
@EmilyMiller @CillizzaCNN @MaeveReston @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump See, @KamalaHarris this is the look I get when I hear about you being president.
@sdonnan @dandrezner No, sorry, it's greatness and SECURITY. Including eliminating unfairness in sentencing.
@sahilkapur @JoyAnnReid That's because we don't like that. Yeah, you make people groan with your partisan ignorance.
@Emma4Change It's not to fight a war. No one is going to fight a war against us. It's for law and order.
@MrWalterShapiro Yes he does, Walter. Get up to date.
Is that a hard evil look on @amyklobuchar face as selling of women for prostitution is outlined out by @potus? In purple? Forgive me if I've misidentified her.
@amyklobuchar and @TinaSmithMN very guarded, but love #OpenBorders
@MeetThePress @mitchellreports @chucktodd @NBCNews Hard to get so much stupidity on one set, I'm so impressed.
#FirstStepAct has done great things. May it continue to do so @potus @vp
@GKButterfield You must have been asleep.
Stupid look on @SpeakerPelosi face as @realDonaldTrump talks about "ridiculous partisan investigaitons".
@markknoller But, and why is that, Mark? Because @TheDemocrats FORCED.
@rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrump Yeah, started by Africans and Muslims. Won't say that though will you Roland.
@dandrezner Revenge is your whole life since @realDonaldTrump showed up, isn't it? I'm so sad for you Dan.
@claynmiddleton @JimClyburnSC is clueless and dishonest.
@washingtonpost No he doesn't, fools.
@SpeakerPelosi has her stupid smirk as @potus talks about economic success.
Greatness! #maga
@vets4bernie Trump is the man.
Oh-oh, @potus attacks "resistance". #resistance
@potus uses the C word. "Civilization". For those who know what it is.
Behavior of @TheDemocrats is making me hate on 'em. Inexcusable anti-Americanism coming out of a corrupt national party of slavery, The Democrats. Jump back.
Ugly look from @SpeakerPelosi
@LarrySabato Anyone who intensely dislikes @potus has bought into foolishness. You want to keep going down that road? For what?
@ron_fournier Take it or leave it Ron.
@sarahdwire @latimes None of them were actually elected.
@kathrynw5 I think that's a GREAT idea, @RalphNortham
@ThisWeekABC @marykbruce We EXPECT @TheDemocrats to act ugly. They are ugly.
@DavidMDrucker I think it's the #fakenews who have canned lines. The rest of us can't afford your cynicism.
@CNN @KatrinaNation They wear white as the color of evil.
@ajc And I want to point out to all racist and #fakenews like @patkessler @wcco @kstp @kare11 @StarTribune @MPRnews -- this is because of YOU. YOU ruin the minds of our children. @washingtonpost @nytimes @chicagotribune @latiimes
@Yamiche @NewsHour Yeah, great line, and you know it's true, don't you?
@schwarz @lhfang It was not true.
@realDonaldTrump has got their number. They're symbolic, TOKEN white men in a party that systematically eliminates white males. The true #EnemyOfThePeople https://t.co/IH5QTfip8t
@ThisWeekABC I'm happy @JeffFlake is no longer in attendance.
@JakeSherman @maggieNYT And the moron #genderquota panderer @amyklobuchar won't attend.
@seungminkim @kathrynw5 @amyklobuchar I'm glad the extremist @SenAmyKlobuchar will not taint the meeting.
@nytpolitics I have no problem with that, I'm glad they'll be absent.
@MariaTCardona @realDonaldTrump Colombia, is that right?
@ABCPolitics @ThisWeekABC #fakenews never mentions the reason you have crazy women in Congress is they violate the 19th Amendment to exclude men from voting. Cap them now. Join with other wicked allies to exclude white men and attack us in the press. YES. Learn, don't listen to #fake propaganda.
@WashTimes Right "debate judge"
@Newsweek #fakenews is a bully and must be destroyed.
@LarrySabato No one who cares about America could bear to watch @BarackObama triumphing as he destroyed America.
@rollcall Well, that's fine then. Because of her selfishness, she'll probably put countless others in jeopardy because she and @amyklobuchar and @TinaSmithMN and @SenSchumer will block a deal. Idiots, if I may say so.
@gatewaypundit @cristinalaila1 Well, she probably thought she was because her mom told her she was. @SenWarren
@mattsgorman So, she's toast. @amyklobuchar
@DavidMDrucker He's already given the answers @FrankLuntz
@DavidMDrucker He's already given the answers @franklun
@WashTimes Old familiar @TheDemocrats politics of personal destruction. All they know how to do is be dictators. Don't like liberty. @brithume
@USATODAY Here's the division @SenSchumer. If you weren't stopped by @realDonaldTrump you would be oppressing me more.
@RepAnnieKuster @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump You don't have the right to talk because you refuse to give a #fairdeal to #BuildTheWallNow
Great news! We'll #BuildTheWallNow https://t.co/9g8yTv0DHW
@RonHarrisMN Of course they would be thugs. Don't make race out of everything.
@staceyabrams @XavierBecerra IOW @staceyabrams doesn't know anything about #TheWall or #theborder so she'll let @XavierBecerra go instead.
@staceyabrams backs out of #SOTU2019 @TheDemocrats response, wants helpo from @AGBecerra because "Spanish." https://t.co/sKRgsfhRM9
@jburcum @MetroTransitMN @keithellison changed the attorney on the #breastcancer case I know you're watching so closely. Because health care.
I am down with @realDonaldTrump on this. Thank you for your leadership @potus https://t.co/Bsc9LQibOq
@wheres_ally2016 @BBC And?
@thehill @HillTVLive @SenatorCollins it is the national parties, including yours, that feast on partisan divisiveness. So unless there was some work towards weakening that, it's not going to happen. Why would you cap men voting at 50% and white men less than 50% by law?
@CNNEE La Iglesia.
@RepAnnieKuster @HouseDemWomen Abortionists. Should wear red.
@WhipClyburn Don't make him do it @JimClyburnSC
@benshapiro @guypbenson Do you know what entitlements means?
@thehill @GovMarkDayton picked @Ilhan,. She will lose next election.
@alanhe @HotlineJosh Ok. So I'll just wait for comments from the women in and around the  @potus race
@thehill It's not racism. I'm sure if the rapist were Irish he would have been hoping to avenge it at that time. Ask Richard Posner of the #7thCircuit #USCourtofAppeals about the origin of murder laws and how they evolved from revenge. It's not about race. Neeson said he's ashamed by rage
@dandrezner @peterbakernyt congratulating @SpeakerPelosi for her divisive conduct would not further unity.
@xan_desanctis @guypbenson Right, @CoryBooker so being raped by @justinfairfax is not as big a deal as someone darkening their face for a Michael Jackson dance contest. To me, you've disqualified yourself for @potus.
@wheres_ally2016 @BBC I'm aware of Turing's theories. I'm not detracting from their usefulness. Of course Charles Sanders Pierce was much more important in the development of computers.
@rolandsmartin @apa1906NETwork @NABJ Join with Christians to support law and order and justice, @rolandsmartin don't engage in pointless reporting.
@bpolitics It's not a "rebuke", dumbos.
Yeah, @amyklobuchar 2%, trying to horsetrade votes on issues for popularity.
@SenSanders Why are you attacking white men, Bernie? Do you think you get points for that?
@seanhannity So he was a victim of sanctuary cities, correct?
@thehill Hope @SenSchumer is payin' him. Wouldn't be right to exploit him for political gain.
@keithellison #MABC is for low-income women. Not necessarily the "most impoverished". Congress wanted to help those low-income women screened with the cancer who could not access appropriate treatment. @TonyLourey is taking appropriate treatment away from them. Do you WANT to do?
That's an absolute adjudicative fact on Schweiker, @keithellison. The goal of Schweiker was to uphold Congress penalizing Social Security recipients who attempted to spenddown to reach @MedicaidGov dollars. NOT for cancer program that didn't exist until 2000. #breastcancer. #wcco
So @keithellison what I'm saying to you and your new lawyer, with all due respect, is that you have relied on Schweiker v. Hogan a 1982 case citing 1965 and 1967 Medicaid provisions to say #MABC doesn't promise meaningful benefits to #breastcancer patients. Tracking me there?
@JerryDunleavy @KyleKashuv Oh so it WAS under @BarackObama @thehill
@sbustosFL It will.
@rollcall That's right, @senatemajldr don't let @TheDemocrats make up fakey dilatory arguments. Give a bill to @potus and let him judge. @amyklobuchar 	@TinaSmithMN this is your #shutdown2019.
@WSJ So? Would he have leaked it? Probably. The issue is what military options are available NOW? And if he's not consulted on that, blame the other generals, not @potus
@costareports @ericawerner Let me be CLEAR to you @USSenate @senatemajldr. @SpeakerPelosi wants a #shutdown2019. You need to get the @HouseFloor to AGREE to a bill that @POTUS says is a FAIR DEAL #fairdeal. Your mission, if you choose to accept it...
@staceyabrams @creynoldsnc Yes, pounding a guy's head in the  pavement.
@cathleendecker @maggieNYT @ericawerner @costareports They need to make a #fairdeal
@dandrezner @DuckDynastyAE Phil is largely correct.
@RichLowry Her writings are fine.
@SaraCarterDC I hope he stays in there. This is solemn government, not your kind of cheap politics.
@BBC Of course. A British homosexual. Sham election.
@rollcall I agree with the early writings that it's best to to stay sober and that women should not think they can go anywhere. The fact is, the same is true of men. Politics are stupid.
@thehill So @RepRoKhanna did this happen while @BarackObama or George W were in there? The pro-tip Hill leaves that fact out.
@adamliptak I don't care if they show up. I won't miss them. Scalia, I'll miss Scalia.
@JonahNRO @HotlineJosh Oh well, guess he'll have to resign.
See @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN this is what you and your commander @HillaryClinton cause everything you talk about "obliterating" the enemy and causing wars you're exempt from. There were 50,000 people like Sgt. Ashley killed in Vietnam. https://t.co/MCP35pXVjY
I back @potus on this. I oppose war-monger girls @amyklobuchar and @TinaSmithMN and their irrational bloodthirstiness. They cause war then see the protection and privileges of their gender. @MinnesotaDFL This is what happens with the rule #genderquotas https://t.co/4jHpCHAeBM
@HardballChris He never trashed Obama afor that @hardball
@WashTimes Check the time-slots in Chicago
@BBC No, FDR.
@rolandsmartin @MickMulvaneyOMB @GOP They didn't say THEY don't care, goofball. They said YOU don't care duh.
This is your beloved sanctuary cities @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN. You'll do anything just to fight the @potus https://t.co/jQ4X0JWkru
Here's the logic, @amyklobuchar no matter how much you tinker with the prices pretending you're actually doing something, someone, primarily for behavioral reasons, is going to be cutting back on insulin. Same with opioids. I would support government diabetes program.
@amyklobuchar My sympathies, Nicole. But @amyklobuchar here is doing NOTHING knowing her friends are citing her ideas to cancel #breastcancer treatment for hundreds of Minnesota women. She's all rhetoric. We need a better approach than @SenAmyKlobuchar
@WashTimes An associate professor of political science at a university who did not know she was having consensual sex. #MeToo
@JazzShaw @AHMalcolm That's it?
@NewsHour First there's the food value, @NewsHour. You got experts like @Yamiche whatever but out here in Minnesota we have a lot of farmers. We understand food should never be used as a weapon in trade talks, it's way too dangerous. @potus @SecretarySonny @collinpeterson Read Taste of War
@Newsweek @RBReich Goal has never been disunion, Reich. @potus
@reviewjournal @WICKED_Musical @MeanGirlsBway @SmithCenterLV You do realize how ridiculous you look wielding a broom, don't you?
@newsbusters @PJMedia_com @rogerlsimon Look @cnn, @amyklobuchar @KamalaHarris @SenWarren @SenGillibrand if you're going to run for @potus, people get to attack you politically, unless you duck from debates and cap male participation like @amyklobuchar does.
@thehill You're talking about "feds". @realDonaldTrump is the @potus. The FED president.
@AaronBlake He's not a racist and he wasn't a racist then. He was a crime victim. And that is NOT @RalphNortham defense,
@DavidMDrucker We care
@seanhannity Generally when you do these things you bring your #Bible with you and open it to the chapter and verse and ask the congregation to do so too. I don't know how you  were raised @SpeakerPelosi.
@SpeakerPelosi is making a speech today. She thinks #Bible says “To minister to the needs of God’s creation is an act of worship. To ignore those needs is to dishonor the God who made us.” Thinks #Constitution makes her equal to the @potus. @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN
So Puerto Rico is bankrupt and isn't going to pay its bills, @Cmarianirosa. Now what? Tell me how the governments in Puerto Rico are actually going to help their people. If you think they are. What's the problem and what are the solutions? https://t.co/gEYPxxeEKq
@thauserkstp Honestly, @GovTimWalz if I were you I would get @realDonaldTrump involved in this situation. So something like this you can't deal with the "will" of people involved. Because the drug attacks the will and kills. You need mental health and law and order. Trump can help.
@thauserkstp Responsibility to be part of an opioid crisis? @GovTimWalz
@NewsHour @LauraSanthanam That's because of the high price of technology so I think no, the rule will not help.
@NicolaAdamsOBE @BBC @BBCTwo He's a good boxer.
@Newsweek I see @AOC has a little gold coffee mug there, fancies herself as ultra-rich.
@thehill Right @SpeakerPelosi and we're not playin' with you. You are plotting your way out of the @HouseFloor
@dandrezner Go back to your room, Dan.
Wow, an associate professor of politics who was very interested in @justinfairfax just showed up consensually in his hotel room. Amazing. https://t.co/uvndKLj21F
@ThisWeekABC Looks like a nitwit but maybe it's just me.
@politico Stop the drivel @SpeakerPelosi
So here's how @LoriSwansonMN lawyer introduced himself in court "T" as in tiger. (And "E" as in elephant, "RR" as in river rat, "Y" because we like you. Brian Terry. It is wise that @keithellison withdrew him. Must be one of those @TheDemocrats lawyers @doug_wardlow talked about.
@Tyler2ONeil @PJMedia_com @AlvedaCKing is a blessing.
@chicagotribune Me too @HowardSchultz, in 2024
And how would that be "improbable"? https://t.co/QmCrSv88IN
@NoahShachtman @rolandsmartin @rolandsmartin makes racism out of EVERYTHING. He doesn't care about the rape in the story, he calls it "alleged rape." He's a #metoo	poster guy. Oh but totally righteos, ever the victim. My reading is Neeson wanted them to attack HIM and see.
@NoahShachtman @rolandsmartin So this is rapist as victim then? If you back to the origins of the current justice system, I believe Richard Posner wrote, it was revenge by families against each other. When you rape, those feelings are still there. It's not "racism", EVERYTHING is "racism".
@KThomasDC @rebeccaballhaus @PeterWSJ He's already made the border declaration it's all over the internet. @SpeakerPelosi kid @sfpelosi already have the tried to tear it down. Will we hear @staceyabrams and her goofy blocking friend @donnabrazile responding to it? But that's your storyline.
@nypost See this is why America loves @realDonaldTrump.
@sfpelosi Wow I guess the Civil War rode all over your Posse Comitatus Act didn't it? So if we only had the act there could never have been the Civil War then, huh? Sorry, you and your mommy will have to think harder.
@BiCoastalSD @realDonaldTrump No it isn't. #theWall is just like a few hundred miles. That is what @SenSchumer and his girls @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN are blocking. @potus can actually, and IS ACTUALLY DOING this. Go for it.
@sahilkapur It's not "border patrol agents" it's military.
See this is the kind of, uh, man who follows around a bunch of lunatics who EXCLUDE him from voting and participating in "nominating" @TinaSmithMN and @amyklobuchar (by "acclamation"). YES, that human wall will stabilize the border and save these children. SHEESH!! https://t.co/WylxORl8yr
@AdamParkhomenko Oh, so in other words, Adam, as @potus uses his powers to do this, you believe you will stymie it and maintain your #OpenBorders. Alright. Sure. And you're a "strategist"?
@thehill @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN your thoughts? Any thoughts?
So @staceyabrams here is the first broad contention sent to @keithellison yesterday. (a) Victoria and Stephen are unconstitutionally deprived of equal protection of the laws under the 14thAm. and as applied in Minnesota under the 5thAm. Not theology, not political rhetorica LEGAL https://t.co/9gQsdAD4kc
@donnabrazile thinks two things are a great vision: First, blockking me on @twitter. Second, capping men, whites and other groups from participation and VOTING in the nominattion of "leaders" like Abrams, @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN @IlhanMN @alfranken @keithellison @GovTimWalz
@davidfrum Uh-huh. So you believe that the inaugural committee did all these things? In effect his inaugural committee is one of the skeletons buried in his closet? smh
@dandrezner I'll tell you substance, Dan. It is that as long as @potus is leading America, China is on notice that we will guard the interests of American business.
@dandrezner So @senatemajldr what exactly is the Constitutonal basis for @USSenate to interfere in declaration of a national emergency? Is it that only the Senate can declare a national emergency? @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN
@ThisWeekABC @potus is the hardest-working president I've ever seen.
@peterbakernyt @maggieNYT @freedomhouse @abramowitz @abramowitz is wrong, those countries don't even have solid constitutions. You should vet this stuff before you print it. They're NOT longstanding democracies, that's the danger.
@washingtonpost Trump is the man. #OneAmerica #oneminnesota
@davidfrum @NPR @MorningEdition You get paid for this, huh?smh
@davidfrum Only culture was is the Quebec Act.
@khennessey @AP As a @TheDemocrats I know this face-painting issue is foolish political correctness. It's freedom of expression. We have real issues to address. This is to paint over, to mask the fact that many @MinnesotaDFL prefer to live in the past. Slavery is over let's move on #oneminnesota
@davidfrum This guy Frum is a Canadian. smh
@AMAZlNGNATURE Eh, what's up doc?
@JoeNBC Blah, blah, Mr. football coach, lmao
@TeamPelosi @SpeakerPelosi is in no position to discuss what leadership is.
@amyklobuchar No, our job is to carry our torch forward.
@TinaSmithMN Right, @SenTinaSmith does not want to be bound by the possible. lOLOL
@CBSNews #fakenews
What happens when two lawyers get together. https://t.co/x2H2ZIdB4J
@IAmAmnaNawaz @NewsHour @NewBlackMan @Yamiche Actually rock'n'roll was considered "race music" because it cause the races to mix. Some people imitated black people. That was a good thing when a well-known entertainer adopted the gendre.
@IAmAmnaNawaz @NewsHour @NewBlackMan @Yamiche It was NEVER about making a "mockery" in the real show business. Actually it's honoring black people and admiring their freedom spirit which YOU don't have, @yamiche.
@IAmAmnaNawaz @NewsHour @fivefifths @Yamiche There's no prohibition against face-painting. You use make-up everyday to go on TV. Give it up. Yes, I liked Judy Garland, Fred Astaire performances. You don't? That's your problem. That's art. Don't cramp free expression because that's your "fight against racism" it's not.
@rolandsmartin Okay? So that's how he felt, and he went out into the street. But no one attacked him so it didn't happen. Your problem @rolandsmartin is you don't have a heart. If you did, you would have potential.
@Newsweek So if the law is so "clear" @Judgenap what is it that's so "clear"? Where does it say "national emergency" in the Constitution?
@JessicaChasmar @WashTimes My understanding is he wanted someone to attack him so he could fight them, after a close associated got raped. Understandable. I think he's saying doesn't feel that way now. But you think it's okay if a woman kills her husband, CORRECT? Think.
@postpolitics @BarackObama DID lie and now you're lying too. You're such a farce @washingtonpost
@NewsHour @DukeU @NewBlackMan @Yamiche So I look at Fred Astaire in "blackface" and I see, yes he studied black tap and was proud of it. These are ivory palace intellectuals pretending they understand folk art, well the don't. Like Billy Taylor told me jazz is America's classical music. Go away.
@NewsHour @DukeU @NewBlackMan @Yamiche That's BS, @DukeU. Many white artists admire black art, especially folk art. You don't know what you're talking about @NewBlackMan. You think just because you have black skin you're some kind of academic rock star well I'm not buying it. And I KNOW @Yamiche can't dance./
@CBSNews So what? Haters gonna hate. It's no shame for these people to wear a costume. 	That's ridiculous. How do you even know what the motives were? So you showed people laughing, probbaly the comedian told a joke. You're race-baiting and YOU should be ashamed.
@RacismDog @davidhogg111 Oh, so he wanted to engage in self-defense and the rapist was black evidently? I'm sure that's what a lot of victims of sexual assault feel. Not racist. So what if the rapist was a rich guy or a poor guy? Don't race-bait.
@brandondarby What happened with the  rape, Brandon? So is Neeson just discussing his feelings? And that's as crime, or "racist" all of a sudden? Do you think he intended to commit a crime?
As we file against @TheDemocrats @GovTimWalz @amyklobuchar and @keithellison for throwing granny off the cliff to face #breastcancer without their promised coverage, remember the differential burden of the cancer disease borne by this women. And throw them OUT! The bums. https://t.co/2Yqxu3WZQG
@iamRuthECarter @rolandsmartin @theblackpanther @FIDMMuseum I don't suppose any of the actors wore makeup, correct?
@FredTJoseph @rolandsmartin Well, so what was he saying?
@RepCummings https://t.co/XAnToscELZ
@RepCummings So Elijah has spoken, huh? And what is people don't care if others paint  their  faces? I don't care? What did @RalphNortham ever do to you?
That's right, that's exactly what I think. https://t.co/kd7xCeaaOA
@thehill So you say he wasn't going to try to find the rapist? Is that what you're talking about?
@thehill You mean @BarackObama? He's a secret Soviet weapon?
@Yamiche @NewsHour @fivefifths @NewBlackMan "History of blackface." From whose perspective?
@seanhannity Sean you should get @GovMarkDayton on your show and let him defend himself.
@PhilipRucker @rolandsmartin It doesn't offend me. Does it offend you? Ever heard of the Gettysburg Address?
I want to debate you publicly about what Minnesota is doing to cancer patients in its government program, @keithellison @GovTimWalz @amyklobuchar. One of you ought to be able to debate, no? Just tweet back.
@keithellison you should look at "Tiger" Terry is doing with this case. Do you understand the law of the Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act? I promise you I do. And if you don't get with it, I WILL educate you. Women are dying, Keith. This is not a play thing
@USATODAY Slavery is the original sin of Africa, not of Virginia.
So am I right @GovTimWalz you just did not hear me in #WorldCancerDay? Okay, I'm listening.
@TheDemocrats You like open borders and human trafficking so you can advance your stinking poilitics. Mercy on you.
@ThisWeekABC I just don't remember any white ballplayers insulting that turkey @BarackObama. Obama encourages this kind of garbage. He's a dumb kid.
@ThisWeekABC I don't want him there, but Trump might.
@thehill He probably is a dope. @Patriots
@dansenor Pretty offensive
@Newsweek Yeah, I guess all the @RamsNFL players were real pretty.
So here is your Feb 4 postmark @MNCourts be there tomorrow. https://t.co/TMqogprxnB
@RudyGiuliani Is he just explaining? Or endorsing murder with @SpeakerPelosi crowd?
@stevemorris__ I like @RalphNortham. Not on abortion though.
@jonathanvswan @tedlieu should be courtmartialed
@SenSchumer Why are you leader?
@ananavarro @GovernorVA Ever paint your face @ananavarro ?
@AngelaDavisMPR @MPRnews He's wrong.
@RepBarbaraLee @SpeakerPelosi No it isn't unfair at all.
@RepSwalwell @DonaldJTrumpJr @SteveKingIA No. I like Steve.
@LarrySabato No it won't. @RalphNortham handled it right. Honest, concerned, but in the end he has not been manipulated. This isn't a "scandal" this is instability in @vademocrats
@RaleighReporter Well, if you'll stop LYIN' about things in Washington, @rolandsmartin everybody will be happier. It seems real slick but it has a cost.
@soledadobrien Why is it insane, or is that your default mode?
@postpolitics Your words fall flat in your attack on the country, @washingtonpost
@ThisWeekABC @GStephanopoulos I do.
It gets old. https://t.co/BmRLqvTfqp
@WSJ See this was the reason chopsticks were invented.
@RichLowry Well if it was a lawyer, I suspect he WAS in blackface.
@W7VOA @HotlineJosh @GovernorVA @washingtonpost No he has NOT lost the authority to lead. @TheDemocrats with their racial quotas, gender quotas, etc. have NO AUTHORITY to lead. World's bigger hypocrites and bigger liars.
@LizMair Your profession is the lowest on earth and you should be offended. Evil people.
@BostonGlobe Yes, I loved the way she sang the #NationalAnthem. Beautiful lyrics, phrasing. Just like I would have done it only better. Thank you @MsGladysKnight and players for your respectful performance.
@MeetThePress @HotlineJosh @RepMcEachin He wants blacks to take over without being elected using a race trope that has no bearing.
@shaneharris @PhilipRucker @FaceTheNation See I'm intelligent. I don't listen to your "analysis". You're #fakenews and you lack the ability to comprehend English.
@thehill He wasn't in a racist photo.
@thehill @HillTVLive They are a referendum on the schlock #fakenews
@rolandsmartin @EWErickson @washingtonpost The paper is a piece of schlock.
@AaronDunlap72 @rolandsmartin Maybe you should.
@JoeNBC In Okinawa we practiced daily in full equipment 4 hours in 100% humidity and 100 degree temperature. Two salt tablets mandatory before heading to the field.
@WashTimes There's a lot wrong. There's a lot wrong with your anti-American ideas @repjohnlewis and @Kaepernick7 too. For this reason I'm boycotting @NFL. Your kind of "leadership" I don't want and I don't respect. @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN
@BostonGlobe I surprised one of my teammates from Pennsylvania playing for the Kadena Falcons when I jumped in front of him picked off a pass with one hand like this. Didn't have any fancy gloves either. It's necessary in case you can't get both hands on the ball. 1973
@ajc Didn't watch it.
@danpfeiffer Oh you mean the @USSenate?
@Newsweek Hint: @potus is a lot smarter than you @newsweek remnants.
No, @margbrennan it was a great no-call on the Rams. The receiver was not even trying to catch the ball, which was thrown beyond where he turned and ran into the defender. The defender has a right to play the ball. It was offensive pass interference, good no-call. @NFL #boycott
@nhpr @tuohy Obviously @DeptofDefense is NOT doing this.
@amandamull @HotlineJosh I don't care what you think about face-painting. Right about something serious.
@TheToddSchulte @HotlineJosh Obviously @TerryMcAuliffe has not been an effective leader and his state is veering into race-based political chaos.
@thehill He's not "dodging" your fake "race relations" questions. Hey why don't you get an A-game not based on your race or on hating the white race? Because I'm not impressed. You need to take another approach or you hurt the country for no reason or purpose.
@ThisWeekABC I certainly agree with Moran on this. @amyklobuchar now tell the country what you did to #KirbyPuckett before you condemn a Michael Jackson dance.
@thehill No he doesn't. His tweet combined the abortion bill with inconsistent accounts by Northam. Again, you're spreading #fakenews
@CBSNews @margbrennan @FaceTheNation That's why we elect a @POTUS
@AP Soccer is the international sport
Israel builds #TheWall https://t.co/TlnogtjpiQ
@nytimes Both of these Senators, @timkaine and @MarkWarner are extremely deficient in intelligence. Stop being led around by @BobbyScott. Get some solid issues and policies, Mr. Scott and stop racial divisive politics. #blacktakeover
@WashTimes @TerryMcAuliffe face-painting is not illegal and you need to stop playing this pointless irrelevant game pandering to race-baiting blacks in government. Tell them to get their stuff together and DO THEIR JOBS.
@jdawsey1 @PhilipRucker @ToluseO Every moment of @realDonaldTrump in office is a watershed moment. He's a great president. Give it up for @POTUS
@washingtonpost Gym class never gave any training anyway. You had to get in sports to get that, get on the varsity squad or maybe B-squad.
@chucktodd @SenRickScott Chuck asks the stupidest questions, that's really his problem. All his "questions" are partisan arguments.
@DefenseBaron @maggieNYT He didn't publicly float it. What he talked about is a greater role for South Korea and Japan, not withdrawing U.S. troops.
@stevenportnoy @maggieNYT @margbrennan @FaceTheNation @CBSSports This makes sense.
@thehill I don't care. There was an election. @vademocrats should stop acting like evil children and stop their genocide.
@alivitali @maggieNYT You don't know what you're talking about. Trump is correctly interacting with his intel agencies. Stop spreading #fakenews
@seattletimes I don't believe housing density is a cause of homelessness. If household units, from one person upward are able to pursue shelter needs, it doesn't matter if they get spread out. Of course, we should provide public transportation to support housing patterns. @StarTribune
@DavidMDrucker No, David, you are confusing terrorism with a caliphate. Apparently you don't recognize the threat of the territorial base, but that is indeed what @potus is correctdly addressing.
@rollcall @SpeakerPelosi had BETTER quit moonwalking and begin to act like she is appointed to a serious political task. She is responsible for destabilizing the federal government.
@WSJ Undoubtedly retail is in transition. This isn't a matter of general economic confidence but of a giant wave of change in the retail sector.
@nytimes First, it's not racist. Second, yes, Virginia and @RalphNortham are under attack by cheap racial politics, of the same nature as pulling down monuments. It doesn't matter if people paint their faces and we're not going to face-painting rules that further abridge free expression.
@ThisWeekABC I don't care about your idea of painting faces. This is not a legitimate issue, it is a race-card play for power to invalidate the election of @RalphNortham and is unworthy of @TheDemocrats
@larryrjacobs My background is as a professional linguist, in that I was trained in Vietnamese at DLI in El Paso, and from then on because to use my ability to pursue many more languages. You may know I headed a co-curricular language learning program at @UMNews as well as Cultural Pluralism
@larryrjacobs I think you're focusing on academic culture, and what languages we should teach in and what should be the role of languages other than English. I think English is a fine language and often wish Americans could actually speak it. Perhaps we've contributed something to it.
@larryrjacobs And of course my grandmothers were native speakers of Swedish and Norwegian. The fact that English-only was imposed through our schools does not obviate this important presence. New Sweden was burned by the Dutch before Duke of York sailed in, and his eventual demise. Languages.
@larryrjacobs First of all you're thinking only in terms of the current moment as you perceive it. Certainly you're aware of American history, though. Your office was previously Spanish, French and British (Canada) territory. All these languages were spoken in U.S. culture. Many Indian langs.
@matthewjdowd @SvensonBrad I'm not GOP. None of these people should drop out of resign.
@healybaum @howleyreports @bigleaguepol I don't care if people paint their faces. And it's #fakenews.
@kibblesmith @KevinStine Doctors do need to cast aside inhibitions in order to work effectively with people. Race is an irrational inhibition.
@howleyreports So do you believe @dbongino received it in October 2018? I mean it was just sitting there in hundreds of yearbooks correct? Whose yearbook did you see?
@larryrjacobs This is a little deeper issue than you suggest. What languages do you use?
@WiStateJournal Another #blackface for your Andy Warhol collection
@JohnEkdahl @ReaganBattalion @JRubinBlogger the @dnc and @MinnesotaDFL are UTTERLY racist, choosing delegates strictly by race, gender, etc., etc. You are suppressing this information and spreading #fakenews in its place.
@bigleaguepol I don't care. Be creative. Paint your face any way you want to.
@MariaTCardona Paint your face however you want Maria. sheesh
@RanttMedia @VanJones68 @realDonaldTrump @VP She's really rambling. You  enjoy this stuff?
@djtweets @CillizzaCNN Well since you're a bigshot #fakenews, why don't you go ahead and inquire then?
@TPNN_ThePoint It's not a racist photo. Politically correct photos. Come up  with real news. #fakenews
@washingtonpost Oh, and stop talking about "white guys". You look stupid when you  do that.
@washingtonpost First of all, there's rock, and there's rock and roll. And other stuff. Your article is #fakenews. Stop attacking musicians.
@ThisWeekABC Uh, he's being attacked because he is a white entertainer and that's not cool? Every performance is a chance for underpaid black entertainers to take cheap shots at the white guys and #fakenews eats it up?
@WashTimes @potus I don't care about people painting their faces. All cultures do that, dress in costumes for events, and we're not going to  have anybody, including black people, putting a stop to that or making it a crime. @TheDemocrats politics of personal destruction.
@UnfilteredSE @VanJones68 @secupp Well, Essey I guess she's saying she really knows what presidential elections are about that that @CoryBooker is coming with weak stuff because he caught a wide-open pass in a pick-up game.
@secupp @VanJones68 In general, I am announcing that I don't care about anyone painting their  faces, and you shouldn't either. Let's get back to reality and stop identity politics.
@secupp @VanJones68 He said he did dress up as Michael Jackson and moonwalked, and that this is not a picture of that. Doesn't know where the editors got that. Apparently there is no photo of moonwalking so he could just be boasting about that.
@RepJeffries @VanJones68 @NydiaVelazquez @RepJerryNadler @RepMaloney Hakeem appears to have come out as #ProLife
@KennedyNation What is it you're supposed to be doing with your lips on this shot?
@thehill I think it's time for the @NAACP to go away.
@gatewaypundit @cristinalaila1 That photo is a cross between Andy Warhol and Beetlejuice.
Who's this  guy making like Joe DiMaggio? https://t.co/nS2v40UKin
This whole face-painting thing is the pitiful #fakenews trying to po everybody to show their great might. They are phony, don't let them "destroy" anybody over face-painting If I may say so they should shut up, actually. They don't impress me they are a total waste of time.
After much careful though, I have decided--I do not CARE WHO paints their face. As far as I know all cultures have engaged in face-painting. Also I note the most powerful African art is the making of masks always cut from a single tree so they were unreal. I don't care #fakenews
So who's this guy trying to make like #ElvisPresley? https://t.co/4xnWpDTWWp
@SNienow It's not racist smh
@EWErickson @ReaganBattalion Well actually what @RalphNortham needs to do right away is stop supporting the infanticiding @vademocrats. Work with the Repubs to beat 'em.
@thehill I'll defend his right to moonwalk, @AOC so I guess the real question is can you moonwalk like @RalphNortham?
@tomperriello @rolandsmartin You're babbling
@thehill Racist! Get @billmaher. @amyklobuchar chastise Maher.
@MayorBowser @scottwongDC He should just govern and never mind the phony drama. Just shows how out of control @TheDemocrats and #fakenews really are.
@realDailyWire @SebGorka See so here it's dressed like Michael Jackson without adding the black face effect.
@JohnCroman @PatKessler Please don't misgender the o-possum.
@thehill Kids today. So desensitized by movies and television.
@langstonwertzjr @theobserver @NCHSAA It's a great sport and I watched the women's freestyle world team tryouts and was very impressed. Mostly military and cops.
@cmarinucci @jmartNYT It's a stupid line. I've never loved him. But usually when you talk in public about a woman you aren't a blatant narcissist. Hardly charming. What wackos there are in California.
@RichardBSpencer So what?
@washingtonpost Don't harass Virginia.
@scottwongDC So Charlie Chan is a scandal, is that it?
@scottwongDC Don't preach @justinfairfax. No it's NOT obviously wrong. It's a free country. Obviouslty if you're bothering people, yes it's wrong however you do it.
@thehill See @AnnCoulter I know you want to be a big guru and all but I think you should be pushing these people, not @potus
@TruthGazetteAL @JohnHMerrill #AllLivesMatter https://t.co/UMmpb55Rn9
@latimes @LZGranderson Well, you're not acting, but you do a pretty good job of trying.
@PatKessler It's impossumablke.
@JoyAnnReid I want to fix @TheDemocrats cleaning out unprincipled opportunists like you @EricHolder
@scottwongDC This is why @TheDemocrats as a party SUCKS. @amyklobuchar phony trying to overthrow other states because she thinks it makes her popular.
@scottwongDC Blacks will stop at nothing to remove governor and topples the white monuments.
@USATODAY Wait, couldn't he make some kind of show over this pay his lawyers?
@BostonGlobe You  mean old white men.
@E2Akpema @AHMalcolm When your cat gets this kind of look...leave the room.
@scottwongDC It's acceptable at a Michael Jackson dance contest @MaxRose4NY
@Jimmyspolitics @JoyAnnReid @GCobbHunter Michael Jackson can get white-face, but a moonwalker at a Michael Jackson dance gets crucified. So it appears the one looking like Diana Ross was not Northam then. But looked a little like him.
@PeckPolitics @AHMalcolm Right, and @justinfairfax can kill black unborn faster than @RalphNortham
@dangainor @KurtSchlichter Yeah, so for a minute I thought they caught Donald Trump moonwalking. That would go straight to #robertmueller.
@stranahan There you go...
@AnnCoulter @KurtSchlichter Yeah, and then get @justinfairfax out there.
@KurtSchlichter The only @TheDemocrats who made like Michael Jackson and moonwalked. Okay here's the deal. If @justinfairfax can moonwalk better, 'e's the guvner.
@DMRegister So it's their own fault, you're saying?
@cspanwj You mean of the Michael Jackson dance contest?
@S_Evangelina @jmartNYT Race tripper who probably knew about the Michael Jackson dance contest. You know, the white-face guy.
@charliekirk11 @ANTHONYBLOGAN Don't worry there are plenty, but they're wrong in both cases. This is why I am not a Republican. @IndyMN Independent Reform Demorat primarying @TinaSmithMN who has a horse in this too.
@BostonGlobe I don't support you @iamcardib OR @Kaepernick7 thanks for turning it down. What could you have been thinking @nflcommish? Do you think you can control the prostitutution and human trafficking in Atlanta? @SuperBowl
@creynoldsnc Drop it. When did you know about the yearbook?
@theblaze So when was the Michael Jackson-themed dance contest? At medical school? And his date was dressed like the KKK?
@ErinMayeQuade I understand you are enrolled American Indian. Can you tell me if Indian women in Minnesota are enrolled in MA-BC and if they are cancelled if they survive alive to 65 in #breastcancer treatment? Could you look into why women are off the cliff? Thanks @GovTimWalz
@basedrogbennett @stranahan @ali @dbongino I want to know if he actually  got that before the election. It is a surprising election kind of thing. Who had it? Is it in fact valid? Or is Northam right?
@nytimes Yeah like @SenSherrodBrown
@thehill So now talk about name recognition. So the upside is he hones his issues and beats the others. Not Trump of course.
@JackPosobiec @gatewaypundit Did he say that? Do you LIKE attacks on monuments from the South? How's your angle on that?
@LizMair @KamalaHarris better stop lyin'. However, she's getting trounced on her side by @CoryBooker anyway.
@basedrogbennett @stranahan @ali @dbongino So do you believe he received a copy of yearbook scan of Northam in October 2018?
@GovMikeHuckabee I know, I hate abortion too. Still doesn't tell us what's going on here. @dbongino told @TuckerCarlson he received the same yearbook scan in October 2018 that would have been shortly before the election. Am I right, Tucker?
@TPNN_ThePoint Well of course what other issue do @TheDemocrats have? All this human trafficking, on the border, @SuperBowl and other conditions women live in, rampant abortions, and the legislators talk about how they're mistreated.
@jbarro @LizMair You THINK a lot of things. I don't know why it was on his page. He wasn't the editor. Maybe it was a joke. I assume he called around and got some names from others. I think let's find out.
@nytimes Not Ty Cobb, though.
@chet_martin @mattsgorman So in October 2018, perhaps days before the election, @dbongino says he received the photos, he told @TuckerCarlson. Or, maybe he didn't. What did you do, Dan?
@JacobAWohl @ANTHONYBLOGAN Obvious difference. Whether Northam is accurate now or not, I still know little about him. I would like to know more. But I don't know what you think's going to happen in Virginia now, but I don't see anything good.
@NRO @jackrcrowe Great! so now @IlhanMN can attack "Israel" by joining @justinfairfax attacking monuments of quasi-Israelis. This is what happens when @dnc runs "elections" based on race-quotas and #genderquotas like @amyklobuchar and @TinaSmithMN use to get "nominated". By acclamation.
@guypbenson Well, I don't know who put it on his page. He went to an all-black high school I believe. @ANTHONYBLOGAN says so. So I'm supposed to hate this guy because he's a @TheDemocrats or because he's white, or whatever? And follow "black leadership" slipping into guv sans election?
@LVozzella @jmartNYT @SenLouiseLucas Or, maybe you shouldn't be a senator Louise, maybe you're just a race hustler determined to "transform" America.
Okay there you go. Of COURSE @justinfairfax and other race hustlers ALSO received this information. Probably in the #FakeNews too. Maybe something like, "let's wait until we get rid of Trump" but the timing got messed us. @dbongino https://t.co/9f9nAnVbeE
@ProfMJCleveland @guypbenson It would mean it was someone else. Maybe one of his classmates even gave names. Have you considered this Prof?
@NewsHour Oh yeah, @TheDemocrats, @RalphNortham are WONDERFUL people! So full of LOVE and well-wishes.
@MrWalterShapiro Disagree. You apparently can't see the peril for the nation of this kind of personal attack campaigning.
@daveweigel @dandrezner You should feel silly.
@guypbenson The solution @seungminkim is that he's under attack. This is what @TheDemocrats like @amyklobuchar call "politics" and "governing" these days. This is why I back @realDonaldTrump
@LarrySabato So which  monuments do you believe @justinfairfax will hit first? I suppose then they'll head all over the South right? Because Justin's such a "moral" leader and needs to replace the targeted @RalphNortham.
@LizMair How about the Canadians have their OWN re-election?
Here's what I see happening. @justinfairfax attacked Robert E Lee as soon as he got elected. All of a sudden a 35-year-old photo appears and he about to sail into the office.I see him taking over and rocking the state as his people come out and attack monuments and in South gen https://t.co/JOCkzQzqKl
@thehill @TheHillOpinion Ja, wohl
@HeerJeet @dandrezner I don't care about @TheDemocrats and @GOP in the first place. I sure don't recognize some race equity for anyone with black skin to tell people how to think. This is just the politics of hate which I reject.
@thehill So was he the yearbook editor? Probably he didn't intend for it to be in the yearbook. But it certainly makes a more interesting yearbook, which for rich doctors is a big deal. It really depicts reconciliation, which is healthy.
@washingtonpost Compare this to MA-BC Medical Assistance Breast and Cervical Cancer plan @keithellison is now defending in Minnesota @MNCourts insisting he must CANCEL women's #breastcancer treatment coverage in mid-treatment. Now THAT'S junk! @nytimes @washingtonpost @nypost @NYDailyNews #wcco
@RobGeorge @JoeNBC I don't think it was racist. I think race was a theme. But this was just a statement about the friends in medical school. Apparently Northam had attended an all black school. I've only seen one source on this @ANTHONYBLOGAN. Also not mentioned, black replacement people seeking.
Well, at least its an idea. Obviously equity paid in is a factor @TheDemocrats would prefer to ignore, along with #faknews. So how much equity would people have at 55, what kind of Medicare would they get, what would be the effect on solvency of the program, etc. https://t.co/2O2C7Ypsaz
@nytimes "Gender parity" in management and political representation should NOT be a goal. It should be merit, leadership.
@Newsweek Didn't go anywhere
@nytimes See, male privilege and gender oppression.
@CBSNews What did Congress know, and when did they know it?
@thehill She's a liar. @maziehirono you don't want a strong third-party movement. @TheDemocrats are crazy and you know that. @HowardSchultz is making sense. He can't run as a @DNC
@amyklobuchar I disagree. This is a medical school yearbook. of @RalphNortham who had attended an all-black school and was known for his association with blacks. It is (for medical students, who are fairly notorious) an image of reconciliation. I doubt we'll ever get a complete explanation.
@theblaze @JoeBiden segregated or integrated we have to work together to achieve. That's just a plain fact.
@AdamBaldwin @KurtSchlichter That was all an act anyway.
@KatrinaPierson @SebGorka So did @RalphNortham attend an all-black school and is that why he was characterized when he changed to a white school, so he carried this with him?
@KatrinaPierson @SebGorka I was pictured in the Osseo Senior High yearbook 1969 as most musical guy, playing Dixieland jazz on the clarinet (pictured). They said, play something cool, yeah, that's good and it made a good photo. Some would say that "racist", cultural appropriation, yadda yadda. Be careful
@Alyssa_Milano It's not offensive.
@RWPUSA Better angels like killing babies in or out of the womb.
@PopulismUpdates Baby killer.
@MPayneCville That's not leadership, that's racism, and I'm pretty sure he's known for a long time about this yearbook play for power.
Racial coup in Virginia. https://t.co/1UPqFXJ2Yw
@jbillinson He's a race-tripper.
@cjane87 He is one of them, @justinfairfax he won the Mexican American War I'm sure you wish we'd lost, because you're benighted and political.
@daveweigel How is he a "rising star"? Show me a single way. You script-writing.
@noblejonesontv Ah yes the noble black tripper. Let the election stand.
@four4thefire He's a black racist who was obviously aware of the yearbook issue.
@WalshFreedom Joe is loony. Publicity hound.
Black coup-maker Justin Fairfax supports black genocide through abortion and poor education and family structure. @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN (abortionist) https://t.co/uGxfSFaykP
@jbillinson Yep, race-baiters.
@ScottHech Most slaves have been white, so whites are also the descendants of slaves. Why do you think we love liberty? Ever thought of that?
@byron_auguste A typical race-baiter.
@RoKhanna The hell you say. You're a racist Ro.
@PoliticsWolf Yeah, "election law blogger."
@PoliticsWolf It will be a black takeover. Which you want but no one will acknowledge publicly to make it look like it's on the up and up.
@RepSpanberger @JamesPindell Did @RalphNortham attend an all-black school?
@tonyajwillms @HotlineJosh Well, what is YOUR fascination or revulsion about being in blackface? Your blood boils because you don't understand something. You feel you have an entitlement because of your race, or your bewilderment or something. Do you even know @RalphNortham or his background. All-black sch
@mikerosenwald @rickklein So did he attend an all-black school?
@ANTHONYBLOGAN I think you said he attended an all-black school, is that correct?
@neeratanden @HotlineJosh Why are they "repugnant and painful." Fact: Did @RalphNortham attend an all-black school?
@ANTHONYBLOGAN Well, yeah, he's black, so a lot of blacks want him in. This is suspicious because it was pretty public knowledge.
@RepMcEachin @jmartNYT Oh, right you want black governor because that's "progress".
@mviser Pocohantas! Yes, deeply offensive @SenWarren
@scottwongDC @RepMcEachin So Scott are you hiding the fact they want to put in a black governor?
@LauraLitvan @JamesPindell So the back story is the Lt. Gov is black and blacks want a black takeover of Virginia like they had with Wilder, wasn't it? Report this and don't hide their black racist agenda.
@peterbakernyt @scottwongDC @CBSNews Fact question: Did he attend an all-black school?
@guypbenson Well, and they should. Remember (and I guess you think this is partisan advantage for you) white male participation like @timkaine @RalphNortham @MarkWarner is capped because of their race, and their gender. BY LAW. They will all fall, including #election2020 prez. START honesty
@NBCNews @hughhewitt That's called Minnehaha Falls. Because of this my school was called @MinnehahaAcad. And called ourselves "Indians." That's not racist. In my yearbook at Osseo I was pictured playing jazz, Dixieland on the clarinet. Not racist. Stop all this "cultural equity" stuff. Human equity.
@ANTHONYBLOGAN I don't see the problem here and do not think he should resign.
@carolmswain So Carol explain what you see. Not party. So is this picture the lion laying down with the lamb? Reconciliation? Or hate and terror? I think reconciliation. I recognize no entitlement for black people to define reality, or whites either.
@CillizzaCNN When I was at @MinnehahaAcad we were the Indians. I-N-D-I-A-N-S. Indians, Indians are the best. Now they're the Red Hawks. So what? I think Indians was a good name. Would some Indians be offended? Well, but then some would be proud. Was it a #blackface motive? No. No entitlements
@CillizzaCNN I think it's enough. So you want a real black as governor, right? Shaming the white race because of play? Go away. Talk about piling on. @RalphNortham is learning.
@washingtonpost Black musicians wanted to play rock when it was big too. Playing roles is not racist.
@RoKhanna @scottwongDC Oh, I SEE. So this is a plot to replace a white with  a black. Yup, makes sense. That's why Fairfax was real quiet about this. Again, being black is NO race entitlement to boss people around. I'll respect whatever decision @RalphNortham makes. This is ridiculous.
@BennieGThompson It's racist for you to force @RalphNortham to resign. You don't have some kind of black entitlement to run the country or to set rules who can stay in office.
@dandrezner Look at the name recognition, Daniel. You political "expert" you. You're eat up with the @dnc. You don't really have a brain just a party and ideology.
@AaronBlake He should not resign.
@BarbaraBoxer Uh, Barbara your party WAS the KKK. What are you talking about? @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN
@LizMair My friends in band used to call me Stevie Wonder. So is that racist? Young people identify acroiss races, across cultures and it isn't a hate thing. @NAACP IS a ate thing.
@DMRegister As I look at the picture and the meaning, it SEEMS to portray friendship. Between a black person and evidently a white person in the KKK. How is this different than @TheDemocrats the PARTY of slaveholders and slavery? Stop the hypocrisy and let @RalphNortham talk, alright?
@nytpolitics So I would ask @USSupremeCourt Alito is this a medical issue? Is it numbers of doctors? Or are medical standards all of a sudden illegal or oppressive or something? @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN
@mkraju @scottwongDC @AthenaCNN Remember @RalphNortham like it or not the first slaves here, were white. They had human rights but not freedom. They were prisoners, the kind of condition of servitude allowed by the Constitution today. I see the blackface as a way of humanizing the races, even celebrating them.
@mkraju @scottwongDC @AthenaCNN Yes, Ralph, why don't you apologize for Virginia? That makes a lot of sense. And for Robert E. Lee, a great American hero, as well. Robert E. Lee himself did a lot of apologizing. Not for his race, the color of his skin. Nor should @RalphNortham. You think he was loving slavery?
@jonfavs @LizMair Oh, I know, because he's a @TheDemocrats and that makes them look like the party of slavery, not party of Lincoln.
@thehill See, he's a hep cat.
@LizMair It was apparently a gag. It was not meant to terrorize or ridicule anybody. Simply saying we have a rule you can't do that, but we have no other viable ideas, is not leadership. We can't go around attacking each other dictatorially as the @NAACP feels racially entitled to do.
@thehill Why should we be ruled by the @NAACP? How does @RalphNortham being governor hurt black people? What are the ISSUES, that are VIABLE of the NAACP if they have any? We need to choose the leadership of the states and let them lead.
@LizMair I didn't think @megynkelly should resign and I don't think @RalphNortham should resign. What are the issues in state government in Virginia? Let's see what he's doing.
@danpfeiffer So he's doing well, correct? Like I said.
@TPNN_ThePoint I don't think @RalphNortham should resign. It's better he work to heal the damage. If that's possible.
@aseitzwald Wait. To be fair, where did @CoreyStewartVA praise white nationalism? So you're saying he was a segregationist?
@amyklobuchar So since you're running for @potus perhaps you could comment on your fellow @TheDemocrats governor @RalphNortham. Like to get your take on it.
@ThisWeekABC Or, Chuck could zip it. If he thinks he could be president let's see him run.
@ThisWeekABC They already had the meeting @SenSchumer and it went fine.
@KatrinaNation @thenation @borosage It doesn't show anything of the sort.
@PrisonPlanet Well I guess we know who was in the KKK outfit.
@NRO No @BrettFavre
@APWestRegion @AP Party!
@WLTX And it will be a Muslim state, @LouisFarrakhan?
@stranahan He kept his elbows straight and did not have the panache of Richard Nixon when giving the victory sign.
@theblaze If it means anything to @MsGladysKnight I first heard her music on an Air Force Base overseas. And I've loved her music ever since. It's a good thing to honor one's country.
@RTSportNews @RT_America @TeamKhabib Well he makes a good point. Guess he wants to fight somewhere else.
@johniadarola @rolandsmartin Sounds reasonable. Just for one primary?

@BostonGlobe So last time @BarackObama tried this he ended up funding his friends' boondoggles. Let private industry do it. @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN
@BostonGlobe Who's the nickle back again?
@harif2 @joelpollak @IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib @BreitbartNews I can support a call for democracy. I can't support saying Israel "shouldn't exist". That's like saying the American colonies should have existed because self-governance was more limited than it is now. @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN are silent, not showing Minnesota values.
@rollcall It does not ignore it.
@postpolitics Well, let's see if he has the guts to tell @WaPo what he thinks about them. Like @realDonaldTrump. And people are listening. They're not just saying.
@washingtonpost @TheRickWilson I'm working for @potus, dude. Now what?
@ajc @NickCannon Cultural equity. I'm thinking of the national anthem, not somebody's culture. He's mad because he's not rapping his own cultural idea of the national anthem at the @SuperBowl
@RepAnnieKuster @VNewsUV Ruling which of course is not foillowed.
@KurtSchlichter @LarryOConnor @ChrisStigall I don't take him seriously. As far as Tran's bill, no, Roe itself would not allow unlimited abortions. I'm still fascinated that she thinks with the live baby there, the parents would make a decision possibly to keep the child. These children would survive. Best is overturn Roe.
@MNSpokesman Exactly. I used to talk to a man, riding the @UMNews campus bus, named Phil, who I think had not finished his Ph.D. in economics. He told me he used to play on the same team as Satchel Paige. Do you know Phil? I can't remember if I ever knew his last name.
@rollcall Oh, the old divide and conquer play.
@GeeDee215 @jmartNYT @NYMag The Grinch.
@chicagotribune Empty speechwriter rhetorical device. What "common purpose"? @CoryBooker @runcorybooker Or is that still being written?
@WSJ @POTUS So I think Prime Minister Xi Jinping should provide a subsidy for these pork farmers to import soy beans and to weather this economic disaster for them. @SecretarySonny @collinpeterson. Maybe they could pay it back over time, or write it off. So Chinese people can eat.
@ajc This is what happens when the refs make a bad call.
@Newsweek You can see they have that shiny new look! So seriously you say contaminated. Is this new in history, and what does the contamination do to them exactly, or don't you know? Is the presence of this linked to a health problem? How long-term is this? Do we all have it or what?
@WSJ Do you have anyone at #WallStreetJournal who understands economics instead of just bean-counting. So the reasoning of rational economic man here is that if pigs get sick, Chinese never eat pigs again. Because if they did, they would raise MORE pigs, requiring more beans. @potus
@nytimes @Ilhan's friends. @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN
Good point, @SpeakerPelosi @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN. This is the Pelosi-led @TheDemocrats @DNC platform for #Election2020; "Mr. President. TEAR DOWN THAT WALL!" Has a ring to it doesn't it? @MinnesotaDFL @POTUS @VP https://t.co/9gh2yootzy

@thehill Really? When's @GeorgeWill going to announce @amyklobuchar campaign?
@stranahan I'm real independent
@dandrezner I won $5 bet when @realDonaldTrump won. You're pretty smart, Dan. How much you win?
@FreeBeacon So who's he supposed to attack as #fakenews?
@KurtSchlichter I think Dave should be fixed, this will stop a lot of abortions.
@thehill Don't miss him. @SpeakerRyan
@swin24 @woodruffbets It's classified duh.
@USATODAY #RemovePelosi. Get rid of this idiot @SpeakerPelosi
@thehill Guess they don't like @staceyabrams. Oh well.
@matthewamiller Would you explain that again?
@jaketapper @ron_fournier Nah, great ballplayer though. Didn't dis the flag, right?
@ron_fournier What is this stupdi thing you have about "port of entry" @AaronBlake??
LOLOL. A little too Zen to be zen. https://t.co/Y63XhdjuKX
@TVietor08 @ron_fournier Right @TVietor08 TV eater, Mr. Intelligence yeah.,
@paschutz @jmartNYT I'll let you Chicago types sort this stuff out.
@thehill Uh-oh! #DOGWALK! @AOC
@nytpolitics LOL! Defiant? Who's he "defying"? YOU/ LOLOLOLOL
@thehill My MAN! This guy is my man. I met him once, he got 65,000 at @usbankstadium.
@OnPointRadio @davidfrum Just make sense @HowardSchultz and I'll listen and amplify your words. Of course I'm voting for @realDonaldTrump but so what? Don't fight with @potus, he also won as an independent. Stay postiive and meaningful.
@washingtonpost That's what I said. #fakenews. Do you want me to take you apartd line by line, WaPo? If you make me get involved I will dismantle your account.
@jrezaian @AaronBlake Don't try this at home.
@KurtSchlichter I would support this @LifeNewsHQ with the alteration of giving the baby up for adoption.
@DMRegister Thank you Gerald for your sportsmanship.
@nytimes History's gotta love @realDonaldTrump
@KurtSchlichter My research tells me @HowardSchultz will kick @TomSteyer's butt.
@gatewaypundit So did they amend the murder laws?
@maggieNYT #WWAJD? What would Andrew Jackson do? @potus
@JChengWSJ And how long with that take?
@thehill @BennieGThompson @HillTVLive That's a lot of BS Bennie (Hey, BS Bennie, that's a name). This is about the southern border. Now again, could you reformulate your statement?
@deucecrew @realDonaldTrump is da man. https://t.co/UnjhV46gMS
I like @GovTimWalz statement that it puts #homelessness in context and stiffens his resolve. Now let's see some ideas @TonyLourey. I hear you're compassionate. How come small towns chase their relatives to the Twin Cities? What can be done about this? https://t.co/DqE64ZNaDY
@thehill This looks like another kind of Zen thing, they cancel a rally because people hate 'em because they're pro-white. That's RIDICULOUS.
I'm pro-white. I admit it. You, @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN @MinnesotaDFL? If you're not pro-white how would you describe yourselves? https://t.co/XF0Ow5SByc
@HashtagGriswold @FreeBeacon So wait, this Buddhist who proposed this bill needs to be understood. So in a Zen statement, first the parents have the child, look at him or her and made a decision whether to kill the child. That's pro-life. Not partial birth. Also how are murder laws affected. @DalaiLama idea?
@stranahan @CNN He did nothing wrong. I like @StoneColdRoger and actually I like Richard Nixon. I read about what they did to him as it happened in the Stars and Stripes. @TheDemocrats REALLY hurt our country and should be ashamed.
So yeah, I'm hailing this @duluthnews (remember our conversation?) @MinnesotaDFL @GovTimWalz and of course @POTUS. https://t.co/qZmEQbxes5 5 million tons. Is that a lot? @amyklobuchar?
@thehill I haven't read it yet, @collinpeterson @SecretarySonny but I LOVE it! As I said at @MNFarmfest https://t.co/qE3KPOEsPA Food should never be a weapon in our negotiations. No starving Chinese. No diminution of food production capacity. Fast-track food. @potus @realDonaldTrump
@RevDrBarber @rolandsmartin So @amyklobuchar when you and #WalterMondale were hammering us at @UMNews you know we're the people (with AIM, others) who passed #CulturalPluralism. Do you object to what we did or do you support it? That would be my question to you.
@RevDrBarber @rolandsmartin Wait, the "super rich"? Couldn't afford to end slavery? I object to that assessment. Please document historically. Give me an academic source like Alan Taylor or somebody. What are we talking about here? This is why @UMNews needs #CulturalPluralism requirement. @amyklobuchar
Here's why @HowardSchultz could never win @TheDemocrats nomination and is treated so hostilely. He's a white male and despite his organization would be blocked from bringing a majority of white males to caucuses and conventions because of gender and racial quotas. Must change.
Of course @IndyMN @MarkJenkins_MN blamed "dumb Scandinavians" for my high poll numbers, and beating @NSAGov's Kevin Terrell. Now @CIA rogue @EvanMcMullin controls my party, now I'm independent reform @MinnesotaDFL primarying @SenTinaSmith @HowardSchultz
The thing about @Starbucks @HowardSchultz is that, whether based on polling or whatever, he's talking sensibly while @TheDemocrats like @amyklobuchar @KamalaHarris @SenWarren are babbling and @IlhanMN types are turning OFF the voters. @potus
Polling/trolling @Starbucks employees about @HowardSchultz prez campaign. I think he could be polling significantly. I polled 13% Gravitas Mktg v. @alfranken and Mike McFadden and I wasn't even endorsed candidate for @IndyMN. So Schultz could make an impact now. @SteveSchmidtSES
@CillizzaCNN It's accuragte see my TL more #realnews analysis
@CBSNews @anitakumar01 Yes he does. See my analysis for #fakenews who have never been (or should never have been) in actual intel work before it turned into straight politics.
@gregorykorte It is #fakenews as I just explained to @thehill. I worked in intel. I know there's extensive raw data and analysis. How do you know intel didn't move closer to @potus, and together they did high-level analysis that's off-limits to you? You don't. That's why you're fakin' it.
@thehill Sure, pro-tip. And what does that mean to you? That @potus moved closer to them? Or they moved closer to him? Or he isn't saying, by saying little. #fakenews
@latimes So you mean "Gay Dalton"?
@latimes I don't see what the big deal was since the black league had a lot of great players and fans. So why the big race issue? So we could dis the flag over social issues? How does this help the sport? I don't support segregation, but that was the status quo and where did we go?
@PatKessler @JohnMarty Restaurants, Pat? You sure you got that right? I'm mean @Starbucks is that a restaurant under the bill? Or establishments?
@ArthurSchwartz I'm deeply disappointed in you, @SenFeinstein
@Newsweek Obviously @potus needs to get the go-ahead from Russia (@amyklobuchar) and China to allow us to go ahead and use force and diplomacy for this mission of protecting basic political rights and human rights. @MinnesotaDFL @Ilhan
@latimes Who wants to learn to be more stupid when there are opportunities in the @potus economy?
@marcorubio @hughhewitt @jguaido Thanks for the translation. Yes, this cannot be allowed and I'm sure by now @potus has already  addressed it. I'm trying to save my wife's life from government cancer treatment programs so I've been occupied.
@davidaxelrod @SenMajLdr So don't give me this stuff about @TheDemocrats don't limit voting participation to favor special minorities. (like the "minority" women")
@davidaxelrod @SenMajLdr How can you and gender panderer @amyklobuchar even say this with a straight face when YOU limit and cap male participation in your caucuses and conventions @dnc?   (And @SenMajLdr ignored a letter from 2014 bringing this fact to his attention in an election contest v. @alfranken)
@politico Your'e out @SpeakerPelosi. Hey don't forget to wear your hijab.
@thauserkstp Chasing $$$
@amyklobuchar Here is a scary story about #breastcancer and @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN. So Amy, do you fund this with @MedicaidGov? Because you'll cut off their insulin at age 65, just sayin'. "We're the govt and we're here to help" @GeorgeWill
Brett O'Neill Terry, lawyer for @E_J_Piper @LoriSwansonMN appearing before Shawn Bartsh @RamseyCountyD2 stealing #MABC from cancer patients spelled out his name, "T as in TIGER". Judge did not spell out her name. #WorldCancerDay @makecancerknown @amyklobuchar @GeorgeWill
@profwschiller @BrownUResearch @WatsonInstitute @amyklobuchar the only "cave" you're going to see are the caves on the border that @potus and our troops are going to eliminate as we #BuildTheWallNow. BTW when you fizzle, you're going to face an onslaught of criticism of your border hypocrisy. Right, @NewbergerJim?
@GeorgeWill @GeorgeWill and @Eminem: TRUMP is the leader that this nation been waitin' for. @potus https://t.co/UnjhV46gMS
@GeorgeWill See @amyklobuchar George is just pretty crazy. #BuildTheWallNow maybe that's why @LindseyGrahamSC came to  Congress. Another #SouthCarolina patriot.
@GeorgeWill Looks like I had blocked George. For good reason. Now he's going from candidate to candidate doing his "analysis". This is not an endorsement of @amyklobuchar, obviously. Or @SenWarren. @esmemurphy gender-panderer.
@esmemurphy @amyklobuchar @GeorgeWill I met Klobuchar, Wayzata hustler, working for #waltermondale, hanging around our governmental meetings (@umncla) trying to prevent Chicano representation and Chicano Studies. We finally had to win an HEW Civil Rights case (@usdoegov) under Title VI to RULE for representation.
@esmemurphy @amyklobuchar @GeorgeWill @georgewill (blocks me). Lots. of Laughs. Another loser #NeverTrumper
@amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar doesn't have the guts to even have a debate, she relies on #genderquotas to knock men out of voting for her "nomination". #Election2020 "Amy Klobuchar"
Actually one of the world's most amazing foods (hint, hint @MNFarmfest) is instant mashed potatos. @GovTimWalz @SecretarySonny
"I know what you would say. And it would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart." Me, when @TonyLourey tells me to drop the mission to #FightLikeaGirl and save #breastcancer patients' lives from Minnesota welfare. @RamseyCounty @E_J_Piper #WorldCancerDay @StarTribune
@GovTimWalz As a husband I have asked you, by @twitter, to declare Monday Jan. 4, 2019 Minnesota #WorldCancerDay @makecancerknown by declaring a moratorium on the cancellation of #MABC, #breastcancer treatment coverage for women already in active cancer treatment in the program.
@davidrobertgrov @SenSchumer @POTUS @PressSec @PioneerPress @tptAlmanac @realDonaldTrump didn't go in there because he wants to play footsie with @SpeakerPelosi
@davidrobertgrov @SenSchumer @POTUS @PressSec @PioneerPress @tptAlmanac You make a good point. However, on caving, so who is it who is building #theWall and will reappropriate funds to complete it? Is it you? Or is it @realDonaldTrump? It's the @potus and I agree the world is watching. Will we allow @TheDemocrats to endanger our people? I think not.
Thank you Mr. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump. #BuildTheWallNow #BuildTheWallAndCrimeWillFall #DonaldTrumpHasSaidItAll https://t.co/GYZy78b1AV
@ThisWeekABC #FakeNews delights in tales of #HumanTrafficking! #FakeNewsMedia hits a new low. #DuctTape. Dear @ThisWeekABC I can't tell you what I think on @Twitter
@PatKessler Sure, Pat. That's no excuse. Thanks for sharing your story. Glad you had such a nice family. @WCCO
@amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar is still excited she's joining @chuckschumer to #ShutdownImpact the government instead of joining @realDonaldTrump to #SecureTheBorder with #TheWall.
So I want to repeat, I have asked @GovTimWalz who I know cares a lot about #homelessness, to declare Monday, Feb. 4 @makecancerknown #WorldCancerDay. And a #Moratorium on cancellations of #MABC for women still in thei #breastcancer treatment @TonyLourey @MinnesotaDHS @StarTribune
Yep. And God loves the United States, and wants to bless you, too. https://t.co/BQ6a6TJT4T
Yeah, @amyklobuchar another "prosecutor". Hey tell @KamalaHarris at the club how you prosecuted #KirbyPuckett for false imprisonment. Both @SenAmyKlobuchar and Kirby, like @SenKamalaHarris carried a big stick. https://t.co/A4pe9uiJqd
I think the losing @TheDemocrats already tried that with @comey, didn't you @SenSchumer @amyklobuchar @HillaryClinton @BarackObama? @potus https://t.co/oFU7t1963l
@Newsweek Must have talked to @SenSchumer and been educated. @amyklobuchar
@scottwongDC @jmartNYT @KamalaHarris @OfficialCBC @CoryBooker Well, she's not really black and I'm sure that will determine their actions.
@kylegriffin1 @JoyAnnReid Castro was very courteous too. The point is you have slunk to the level of imprisoning yoru political opposition like Josef Stalin.
@joelpollak I don't mind that, hopefully Obama had a brain. I DO have a problem with @chuckschumer @amyklobuchar because now they're discussing highly classified raw intel data in political disputes with the @POTUS. Do you, or they see the problem here?
@alfranken @davidfrum Yeah, "your democracy" caps MEN from voting as delegates. Of course they let YOU vote. I'm sure that says something about you. @MinnesotaDFL
@seanspicer @DailyWireLive I think the problem with this language is "not be allowed to exist". That's a problem @Ilhan. So what other nations do you think should not be allowed to exist? Do you see the problem here?
@thehill Private case files, so #RobertMueller own personal files? Were they copied and given to reporters? What does he mean?
@thehill @HillTVLive Okay @RepPeterKing but "a pretty good job" doesn't cut it. I trust @potus. If he has an opinion, that's a good thing. I can't see the raw classified data they're discussing. Can you? In any even, a discussion is good. So Iran? You think it's all good then, is that right?
@bennyjohnson @gatewaypundit @IlhanMN Just remember @GovMarkDayton this is YOU. Your arrogant, self-admiring rich guy @LifeatBlake benighted nonsense. This is why you don't represent me. I have more to say but this is twitter.
@ByronYork The @HouseFloor is full of idiots. That's the starting point. However, it looks like the @USSenate could still pass something. @potus has to fight. For the American people and for America.
@RepLeeZeldin @ArthurSchwartz You take a little while to figure out what's happening Lee. So note that @ValerieJarrett is on her twitter feed saying "We've got your back." JUST so you start out with an awareness of what you're talking about. You say it's a problem no matter. She says your a problem. @potus
@NRO @RameshPonnuru These women should not  be touched, PERIOD. @TinaSmithMN
@amyklobuchar If you're going to have an intelligent discussion, you concentrate on the points of disagreement about the objective situation. Obviously based on what he knows, @potus believes the presentations the the @ussenate are debatable.
@rolandsmartin Must have missed it.
@amyklobuchar I actually worked in intelligence. You are a lawyer, overrated. From the intel side you have all these kinds of sources, and you analyze, you compile. It's supposed to be useful not for pols like you to make fights over. Just. Stop.
@amyklobuchar And Trump has not "ignored" what the intel say. @washingtonpost is constantly attacking the @potus on this and anything they can. Like you. Losers who don't have the best interest of our country at heart, buts self-promotion.
@amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar you lack the intelligence to talk about national security issues. Again, this is classified information. He's giving his views. So what, he appointed them? You think his duties end at that point? He's PRESIDENT Amy. Just stop.
@stranahan Uh, Billy thinks the girl's really sexy and is jealous of Donald?
@rolandsmartin See, there you go, lyin', Roland. I checked it out and you don't have the Graham story  on.
@sarahdwire @latimes @sbjusc VERY stupid people.
@dandrezner See this is YOU doing this @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN UNDERMINING our national security, whilst lying during elections to con Minnesota voters with #MinnesotaFakeNews
@CBSEveningNews @CBSNews @MajorCBS Did not contradict, right? Just disagreed? Show me the contradiction.
@NYDailyNews What is the sound of one hand clapping?
@mattloff @NewsHour @SenCapito See, signs of intelligence in @SenateDems. Won't reach "out there" @amyklobuchar and @TinaSmithMN though.
@thehill Fire your stupid lawyers @MattBevin
@amyklobuchar Hey you better have #robertmueller investigate @HowardSchultz and @realDonaldTrump for colluding--with each other!
@amyklobuchar You're red-baiting as a discredited tactic to fight @realDonaldTrump. Now @HowardSchultz is jumping in to beat your butst by talking sense, which you are incapable of doing in any event.
Thank you @realDonaldTrump for moving to end the cycle of human suffering on our southern border. @MinnesotaDFL @SenAmyKlobuchar @TinaSmithMN @senatemajldr @LeaderHoyer https://t.co/6npVvq0ILK
@JoyAnnReid @SenatorTimScott I don't see any reason to attack @SteveKingIA. MAYBE you don't understand what he said, and what reporter questions he was answering. Check it out first.
@politico No he didn't He's the @POTUS
@ThisWeekABC @karentravers That's not an insult. We can't have them spreading false intelligence. @amyklobuchar
@nytpolitics Uh, @amyklobuchar investments by @MOFA_Taiwan in U.S. might be a touchy subject while tariffs are causing concern in China. @potus Soi it might not just be about "bragging" or "hailing"
@thehill Yeah...
@NRO @JonahNRO @SpeakerPelosi is a criminal trying to abuse the party racket to harm our country for her own gain.
Important victory against @TinaSmithMN. There will be more! https://t.co/YqEPiQz3UC
@politico That's alright. Neither can she.
@brandondarby Troops....
@thehill Talk about a knucklehead...
@MeghanMcCain @guypbenson @GovernorVA See now we're on the same page, Meghan.
@CillizzaCNN He didn't say intel is wrong. You don't even know what they have. He's saying he's getting different information. Did they say Putin did it? So information sharing might resolve the issue. That's difficult, of course because of sources and methods.
@AHMalcolm @JazzShaw How is having an affair with a guy because you work for him and want favors "love life"?
@CillizzaCNN You still don't have any hard intelligence on this, Chris. Only because you are MENTALLY LAZY do you assume there is proof of what @potus intel people actually know. So if potus doesn't have it he has to weigh their ideas against the denial. You disagree?
@dandrezner Right. Give a SINGLE concrete example, @maggieNYT not anonymous generalizations.
@smontemayor @ChrisSerres As I have informed your colleague @mnhealth is cancelling women's #breastcancer treatment coverage before their treatment ends, violating Minn.Stat. 256B.057 subd.10(b). Check it out. Isn't that elder abuse? Killling them?
@creynoldsnc Obama crowd disrespected the entire country.
@PamelaGeller @gatewaypundit What's the source of this report? I can't talk about it unless I know who's reporting it.
@thehill Why do you constantly have to put everything in terms of "bragging"? Did you talk that way abouit Obama? You turn me off.
@thehill You know @JohnBrennan I'd tell you about your intelligence but I don't want @twitter to restrict me. So what, you think "intel chiefs" are gods or something that can't be criticized? I WANT a @potus who will listen and be able to think critically. You're acting very inapprpriatly
@thehill Yeah, they always cut classes
@MariaTCardona @BarackObama LOL
@weeser1 @amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar She's got a combination Electra and Oedipus complex. In the end all sound and fury.
@weeser1 @amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar Check out the @dnc rules and @MinnesotaDFL Constitution plus Minnesota election laws and we'll talk. It is true. Overthrowing dad.
@larryrjacobs This wacky theory explains why Larry helped so much to destroy @IndyMN as a major political party. The untenable corollary is that if all third parties are removed the two corrupt national parties will be reasonable and act in America's best interests. @UMNews
@washingtonpost So your "argument" is if it's legal @potus shouldn't tweet his support? #ysos?
@amyklobuchar Honest ads LOL. Nothing about you is honest, @SenAmyKlobuchar you're an ambitious political hustler who panders to gender, anything but white males like your dad. Yes, other countries don't always make it easy for Americans. But you can't blame and imprison your adversasries DUH.
@renato_mariotti @HotlineJosh @FT Trying to be insulting, of course. Soak your head.
@thomaswright08 @HotlineJosh Obviously this needs to happen, when people can just get to know each other better outside of all the shouting and witch hunts and shoddy electioneering.
This makes sense https://t.co/xjkVsOzpKb
@thehill It's so inspiring @Cliff_Sims has gone from gofer to making so much of himself. Maybe @amyklobuchar can get out of the kitchen.
@continetti @hughhewitt I think you know that's false.
@postpolitics So? Obviously made great progress on ISIS AND North Korea as @potus says. It's the job of intel to not be optimistic. It's the job of @realDonaldTrump to use his assets to solve the problems or potential dangers they identify. Your job is sit in your ivory tower throw spitballs
@johngramlich @HotlineJosh @TheDemocrats @MinnesotaDFL are not honest and ethical. They want stuff from government, and think they've all been oppressed. I would take care of business at home first instead of projecting on @potus
@amyklobuchar @SenAmyKlobuchar led a letter! Wow! did you put one of those Mike Dukakis helmets on and ride around in a tank, commander? Think about how much childlike faith you're putting in cyber personnel. Maybe more of the jobs should be essential @potus.
@amyklobuchar So a lot of the "conclusions" you draw @SenAmyKlobuchar and gossip and character assassination you carry out as "your job" are insubstantial. @realDonaldTrump is honest and quite competent. Not a Russian agent! I know that's big surprise for you. Look beyond your nose for truth.
@amyklobuchar In case you haven't figured it out @SenAmyKlobuchar your job is chiefly to sit there and talk trash. Outside of rogues like @JohnBrennan intel will keep its head down and aid the president in keeping America safe. What they do is classified. It involves a lot of military.
@CillizzaCNN How scientific of you Chris. Glimpses of how great yoru mind could be if you didn't spend your life writing drivel for a living.
@amyklobuchar I'll remind you @SenAmyKlobuchar winner of nominations where men are excluded by law, when your hero @BarackObama's @MichaelJMorell sat on TV and said when the missiles were flying that we couldn't know where they were located. You're unqualified to think about these matters.
@amyklobuchar This is very typical of you, a political motivated cynic who pretends she's polyanna. Attributing dishonesty to the president because intel agents apparently  based not on just a crystal ball say peace is "unlikely." @potus attacks it, he'll use the information @realDonaldTrump
@IanSams @Gallup That's not how the American economy works, sorry, @KamalaHarris. I see how you got misled.
@Newsweek Well @brithume, @tombrokaw is not a racist. I doubt you said he is. You know #fakenews twists wht you say. "consensus against racism"? See if they were doing that to him they would be racist. Not sure if you're quite on to that.
@thehill @HouseDemocrats are unacceptable. Need a new crop. #Election2020
@tippytops1 @NewsHour @FBI I think it was their posterior.
@politico OH! I thought @SpeakerPelosi was holding out until they let HER make @TheDemocrats response. So she could have another #tinklecontest.
@ByronYork Duh, replace @SpeakerPelosi? @dnc @TheDemocrats @MinnesotaDFL
@thehill Good. Translators are politicized, attention seeking media hounds.
@creynoldsnc We're shaking in our collective boots. Let me guess: EVERYBODY's a racist and that's why the party won't let white men vote. @potus @dnc @MinnesotaDFL
@mtracey @stranahan #FlakeNews
@APHealthScience @AP I don't support this. We need food industry helping to fight hunger. If you have a public health program, use it to try to change eating habits and stop blaming everybody.
@HowardKurtz @joelpollak Oh, okay. Well, hey, stop by, I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
@MissEllieMae @lhfang So how will he apply what he has learned about tax avoidance? He looks like he could use a new suit.
So the billionaires agree. What next? https://t.co/EB1PTBZ2NO
@FedSoc @neal_katyal But unfortunately they do, until the @USSupremeCourt comes up with some kind of a scheme for rewriting court rules and statutes as they have done with class actions.
@seanhannity Why doesn't he just run as a @TheDemocrats? It would be fascinating to hear from someone with some sense.
@thehill @RepJeffries if you can't get @SpeakerPelosi to stop prancing around and pay attention, your name will be all over the tough negotiations you will face.
@rollcall Morons.
@MLevineReports @ThisWeekABC @leeferran They're not "challenging". Can't you cover a real story?
@sahilkapur @margarettalev @StevenTDennis The problem with this @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @VP is it kicks the can down the road. How much $$$ for #TheWall as @TheDemocrats @collinpeterson and #bluedogs want?
@CNN #FakeMed
@KamalaHarris It's not Medicare, @SenKamalaHarris you are deliberately misleading (euphemism for "lying").
@RepAdamSchiff Nah. I agree with Whitaker. DEFINITELY. NOT. you.
Actually IF I were a hungry kid, @GovTimWalz I'd be pretty pssd about phat teachers saying "a hungry kid can't learn." Baloney, to use a food metaphor. Kids NEED to have a hunger for learning. FOR. LEARNING. Not shaking their booties. So daytime show I'm watching has it wrong.
@AaronBlake Oh, wait, so now @TheDemocrats say @Starbucks is "really awful"? How can even #fakenews people consumer this kind of "political discourse" without throwing up? (Hint: #FakeNewsMedia is really awful). @HowardSchultz
So let's talk @GovTimWalz @TonyLourey about impact. Ad says "Nothing can prepare you for hearing those words you have stage 2 breast cancer." What prepares low-income women screened through SAGE is MA-BC. Coverage to get it treated. Why you cancelling it? Can't you get this?
@JoeConason I take @potus VERY seriously, Joe, and I'll tell you why. He takes #AmericaFirst seriously. Which you don't. So what are you doing even talking about it? #FakeNews
@errollouis @mikiebarb VERY terrible. WTH is going on @BilldeBlasio? @POTUS what do you think is going on here and can you have DOT address this? Also @RealBenCarson because of implications for housing development there?
Well, while @amyklobuchar stokes her "campaign" with record #shutdown2019, @HowardSchultz actually attacks another candidate, @SenWarren saying her wealth tax will never pass. (probably not this @USSenate probably the wacky @HouseFloor though). https://t.co/SjIVHhqVcG
@CillizzaCNN You're really mean, you know that Chris, to @HowardSchultz. Hope you don't treat @amyklobuchar so mean. She found a great angle on the #shutdown2019 she promoted with her stupid behavior. She's got new foreign interference with gov websites from layoffs. (and it WASN't sabotage)
@NRO @jackrcrowe They should probe @cnn
@NewsHour #fakenews
@brithume @NRO @RichLowry Nothing offensive about what @tombrokaw said and I rarely defend him. He, and all of you, SHOULD encourage immigrants to do MORE to get their kids to do more to assimmilate. To do that, the @UMNews needs to implement the Cultural Pluralism Req. I co-wrote and develop curricula.
@thehill They were. Stop undermining the @potus. #ysos?
@BBCNewsnight @stranahan I'm sorry, wait, you did WHAT? We, @potus America, saved you. What kind of propaganda have you been listening to over there?
@CBSNews @SpeakerPelosi and @KamalaHarris and @amyklobuchar need to move their tushes aside and allow @potus to #BuildTheWallNow. They're undermining the economy.
@NewsHour I'm trying to remember what the @fbi couldn't find without a flashlight.
@politico I would SHUT DOWN #RobertMueller it's disintegrated into a bunch of crazy @TheDemocrats trying to direct the outcome they want. It's already biased with just the Mueller lawyers and the all-black "grand jury" of haters in Washington D.C. End it. Make 'em win #Election2020
@rollcall I'll try to explain to you @Cliff_Sims because you don't get it. @potus wants to hear all the opinions he can to make the best decisions. Can you understand that? This is like a major corporation that is exploring all kinds of possible actions. It's a tough atmosphere so is U.S.
@KenDilanianNBC @dandrezner @realDonaldTrump This draws another comment on your #fakenews intelligence. Dan loves to hurt America in foreign affairs, and Ken celebrates potential disaster for his country. Still no knowledge.
@RealSaavedra @Veteran4Trump "A civil society." Like California, you mean. @KamalaHarris
@USATODAY Men are pigs. What can I say? I know that. That's why Jesus.
Is this a comedy, prez @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN? So we're indicting a guy for threatening someone's dog (taking it away from them as a service animal)? https://t.co/f9QVgpg95o
@thehill No backlash. This is ridiculous and degrades the @USSenate. I wouldn't expect @TinaSmithMN or @amyklobuchar to speak up.
@amprog @Frederc10 Yeah, so Prancin' Nancy @SpeakerPelosi please pay attention, you're not so cool.
@PrisonPlanet Ah, you're paranoid.
@thehill LOL. @BarackObama IS a foreign policy crisis!
@AaronBlake Good ol' reliable @amyklobuchar and the rest of the Fantastic Cast.
Oh goodie! #tinklebell gets to tinkle on #TheWall (it's immoral you know). @SpeakerPelosi https://t.co/FxduruqZYd
@JamesPindell @BostonGlobe @MikeBloomberg I'm waiting for @HowardSchultz to get out of my lane, ah-hem!
@kpolantz @SaraMurray I see why you ADORE Fidel Castro. Etc.
@TheStalwart Oh, you mean the chief black grand juror? Oh well. You can't please everybody.
@CELSOPIAZZl @KurtLucas16 Lots of work for doubles
@washingtonpost This campaign needs to get back to issues: Like #BuildTheWallNow
@washingtonpost Then @BarackObama will show up to heckle @realDonaldTrump: Well, I'M not a billionaire, but I play one in the @WhiteHouse! And you can too! Everyone can be a billionaire! Billionaire for all! More perfect Union!
Oh @TheDemocrats are shouting "egoistical billlionaire" at @HowardSchultz? Well that takes the pressure off @potus. Then if Michael @business gets in, it will be an echo. I'm waiting for @KamalaHarris and @SenWarren to shout in unison: "Egoistical BILLIONAIRES!!" THat will help https://t.co/PViyu6sfXQ
@KamalaHarris doesn't do well on TV. She looks extremely stressed in these photos. I know @TheDemocrats are worried their party is going to break on the rocks. Then Ms. BettyCrocker @amyklobuchar will appear by the lighthouse--Here I am! Hotdish! and take on @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/Y3pnWpiBD1
Attention, the online star @CillizzaCNN has raised an important issue. It's UNCONSTITUTIONAL for @HowardSchultz to run for president! Thank you, Chris. @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/WjfH3YoQUm
@thehill So General @SenBlumenthal is another Commander Mike Dukakis? But @KurtSchlichter I wonder if #RobertMueller should be shut down if @TheDemocrats are using him to send messages to the DC grand jury. Wasn't this supposed to be Deep State DOJ or something? How'd Congress get in?
@KurtSchlichter Very weird. So his/her/its point is that conservative people "cringe". I don't respect anybody's right to "cringe", that's not in the Constitution.
@KurtSchlichter @townhallcom I know they  do. So what is your next point? I mean I don't want to get you depressed. I know you, as I, served to protect them, the haters. That's what women like @SpeakerPelosi @TinaSmithMN have made out of civil rights just more reasons to hate you. Republic is at risk, so....
@jemelehill @rolandsmartin That's just crazy. @tombrokaw isn't humiliated here. He's just not @realDonaldTrump with actual guts. So a lot of hispanic parents WILL tell their children to work hard to assimilate. That's a GOOD thing and it's not for you to judge just because you're black. @JoeNBC @brithume
@Eugene_Robinson It's white privilege, right Eugene? @HowardSchultz Plus, he's a white male.
@usatodayvideo @USATODAY @Oprah just remember those women who on their 65th birthday get their #breastcancer treatment coverage under @MedicaidGov CANCELLED by the state. #FightLikeaGirl https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A So if you were diagnosed under NBCCEDP with the cancer you'd lose your coverge today Happy BDy
@AP So is this actually true, #ap? Because I read she was sentenced to death unless she leaves the country. So has she left the country? And is that really "freeing" her? @VP
@GovTimWalz @TonyLourey PLEASE observe @makecancerknown in #Minnesota by imposing a MORATORIUM on cancellations of surviving women in Medical Assistance Breast and Cervical Cancer in treatment until a @MedicaidGov IMPACT STUDY can be carried out by @MinnesotaDHS. #FightLikeaGirl
In Minnesota February 4th is World Cancer Day, when organizations and people around the world unite to raise awareness about cancer. @makecancerknown #MINNESOTA! #FightLikeAGirl! @AmericanCancer https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A #wcco #kstp #kare11 @myfox9 @FoxNewsSunday @MNSupremeCt #PBS
@PatrickBuchanan Re-instate the boycott on both Cuba and Venezuela? @AmbJohnBolton @VP @POTUS @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN
@JoeNBC @Morning_Joe Oh wow, you're "latest". My observation would be as "toxic" as you and your wife think @realDonaldTrump is, a lot of voters in #election2020 will think @KamalaHarris @SenKamalaHarris's ideas are far MORE toxic.
@nbc lol. So here's a #1stamendment-protected business attacking another one of its starts, like @realDonaldTrump, for freedom of speech! That's why I'm grateful for the developoment of social media outlets. Imagine if I had to put up with with only from commercial media! https://t.co/YgElt9nVC2
@rolandsmartin It's not inappropriate. It's not inaccurate because it's something a lot of hispanic parents would say to their own children, in order to help their families. It's something a log of parents might not say to their children, it's a matter of opinion. So @tombrokaw is free to have
@KamalaHarris is anti-education. https://t.co/PHWgPfuL59
@mkraju @JamesPindell @jaketapper @KamalaHarris abandons DACA completely. NOT qualified for any @potus position. Lacks honor and principled consistency.
@mviser So? That's a non-sequitur
@KamalaHarris is a non-starter. https://t.co/cQw1ZwullA
@mkraju @IanSams @KamalaHarris is wrong. This is what @HillaryClinton thought too.
@JohnnyAkzam Me too
@JohnnyAkzam Really? I thought he was pandering to diversity.
@burgessev @BresPolitico @sarahnferris There is one way to push him away, @senatemajldr get a #fairdeal.
@LoriSwansonMN @SenWarrenLimmer Yeah, @LoriSwansonMN how about you cancelling #breastcancer treatment coverage while the women haven't finished their treatment yet, but are still surviving? How do you think THAT impacts the effeciency, economy and quality of care of their @MedicaidGov treatment? PLEASE answer.
@RWPUSA @realDonaldTrump @RWPUSA gets it wrong. The only purpose for the @gop was to abolish slavery. PERIOD. It wasn't in Texas, it was in Wisconsin. Whigs weren't doing that.
@burgessev @lisamurkowski GET a #fairdeal. This is about national security, not your popularity.
@burgessev Get a #fairdeal, Mitt. @MittRomney
@davidhogg111 Oh, I do. @TinaSmithMN
@ReaganBattalion @BernieSanders Commie plot, call #RobertMueller
@burgessev Get a #fairdeal
@StopBigMoney @richardcarlbom These are too great guys.
@brd_dispatch Figured that might happen. Watched state track meet a few years ago. Discus, too.
@burgessev It's going to happen if you don't get a #fairdeal.
@Politics_Polls @MorningConsult Trump doing a great job.
@VoteBetty @ianvaver No, they were RIGHT. Don't mess up the economy, Betty.
@noahgo @IlhanMN @Ilhan He will get his wall.
@jamestownsun Sounds like corruption to me, undue influence by businesses, and decision should be reversed.
@RepJudyChu @IlhanMN @Ilhan @SenMurphyOffice Yeah right.
@ABAesq As you tweet it is seems overly broad and would include consensual relations.
@davidrobertgrov @amyklobuchar @SenTinaSmith @RepDeanPhillips @AnnCoulter @PioneerPress @newtgingrich @SenTedCruz @LindseyGrahamSC @PressSec @ChuckGrassley @AP It could include non-citizens in the United States. However, there's nothing in the Constitution that would prohibit identifying those non-citizens being counted. There's every reason to identify the numbers for the distribution and regulation of government spending.
@Stopcheckinonme @AmericaRising17 @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats It really doesn't.
@davidrobertgrov @POTUS44 I anticipate we WILL get a #fairdeal within the #21days.
@b_stahl @MinnesotaDHS @MedicaidGov @USSupremeCourt Of course. I'll talk it over with my wife and send you the notice of appeal to the Ramsey County District Court from the final decision of Commissioner @E_J_Piper (now substituted by @TonyLourey. I think I can do it electronically. Now we're preparing the appellant brief due 2/4
@thehill So the Hill's solution is to fight the border wall for #21days. You're responsible for the damage you do.
@FrankLuntz I think @tombrokaw was talking about FIRST generation, Frank. @brithume
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump Really? So @potus "goaded" @HowardSchultz and that's why the Seattle guy is trying to run? I think you're lying. I think you're spinning #fakepolitics, David?
@maggieNYT You were wrong the first time, Maggie. You don't know ANYTHING about government. Tell me what have you ever governed?
@DMRegister That's good then.
@AaronBlake No it ISN'T also true they tend to be "bad candidates". You're a corrupt #fakenews hustler who won't admit you're SELLING the elections to put $$$ in your own pocket.
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump He doesn't have the guts to fight your corruption of the @dnc, David, that's what @potus is saying. No it's not a "double dare" to @HowardSchultz. Howard probably is naive enough to think we live in a free country. Doesn't know you're a racketeer conspiring with foreigners.
@WashTimes Like to hear one of his sermons.
@FrankLuntz Everything comes with a stigma, @FrankLuntz @Austan_Goolsbee
@maggieNYT That's good news @GinniThomas
@joelpollak Well, not to get into a discussion with @therealroseanne about her religion. But maybe she has more spiritual strength now she's in Israel. So for instance she doesn't get his for talking about Muslim Brotherhood and @vj44. That's funny, why would that be?
@TheDemocrats Why do you argue @potus wants an "ineffective border wall"? #ysos?
@TPNN_ThePoint Thank you, Dan. @DanCrenshawTX
@thehill Maybe the writer needs to have his head examined...
@maggieNYT These things are said in a campaign...
@pastormarkburns @realDonaldTrump I'm behind you. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. You can't have knowledge without wisdom. Kids are uneducated and floundering because of our attacks on God. And that includes the @USSupremeCourt
@davidfrum "We"? Canada has a deficit too? The point now is to grow the economy. I have already said, including to @potus that we need a Congress that reverses growth in the debt, in part by returning power and resources to 50 states. And @MittRomney agreed with me in 2012 when I said this.
@emzanotti @HotlineJosh True. Absolutely true. And yet it is all @TheDemocrats not just @Ilhan who are doing this.
@nytpolitics You're #fakenews and I will watch @realDonaldTrump prove your failed and failing enterprise wrong, again. And I will help.
@LarrySabato @pewtrusts I thought you were pretty good at elections when I was in college. BUT, you NEVER reported that @TheDemocrats cap men from voting and participating in nominating candidates like @amyklobuchar for federal office, or the @potus. Did I just miss it? Was it in your book?
@thehill Trump never attacks science. Duh
@AaronBlake You're #fakenews. Clickbait. Do something useful with your life.
@Newsweek Personally I needed to work and was glad to get work as a minor. One of my favorite jobs was working with my grandfather on county fairs around the  state, and the State Fair. Also worked as groundskeeper, shoeveling sidewalks and maintenance. Minors need income.
@NYDailyNews I agree and already tweeted that.
@LoriShemek @rolandsmartin So what are you saying?
@ajc So we all agree he is a homosexual then.
@CharlieCookDC Interesting. Well, I'm primarying @SenTinaSmith @tinasmith in 2020 @MinnesotaDFL primary, so put that in your book.
@CillizzaCNN It is unconscionable. But then, you're disloyal to your country Chris so you  wouldn't care.
@postpolitics #fakenews
@Elitedawg34 @Stopcheckinonme @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats I'm leaving that to C-in-C.
@Acosta Watch your language.
@SenBobCasey is speaking the right language #bluedog @amyklobuchar. You should join him. @TinaSmithMN https://t.co/pUQkJgIOgt
@abbydphillip @maggieNYT @abbydphillip and @maggieNYT think it's a big joke if OTHER women, but not them, are in sex slavery. So they can poke @POTUS. So if you big shot #fakenews journalists approach these criminals they might kills the girls and bury them. You need to get real.
@FridaGhitis @IanSams @KamalaHarris LOL
Love it! It is my new #Valentine! Somebody make a million of them and sell them on the internet! #BuildTheWallNow https://t.co/d1JeMkzQKO
@Newsweek So in other words now @TheDemocrats @HouseDemocrats are attempting to INTERFERE in the #mueller investigation. TIME. TO. SHUT. IT. DOWN. @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN
@nytimes Reminder: @SpeakerPelosi DISapproval 49% for #shutdown. -19. Highest UNpopularity of anyone involved. Do NOT continue to praise her or you too #fakenews are HURTING these people you write about. #ysos?
@bpolitics As managing editor at @aapress I had a conversation with Johannes Huyen when he had been civil rights director for @cityofsaintpaul and I was advocating for bilingual education. He was adamant that students should speak English-only or they would fail. @DukeU (and you too)
@bpolitics Then go ahead, Chinese students and speak straight Chinese. But please stop race-baiting the @DukeU faculty and do whatever it is you're doing, out of touch with the culture you study in. You can just steal the information and leave it at that.
@elainaplott @HotlineJosh It may come as a surprise, Elaina, but most refugees would be happier NOT being refugees. Stop your race-baiting.
@mkraju @maggieNYT Lamar is not too bright. @LamarAlexander look at @SpeakerPelosi #shutdown numbers and let @potus handle this. This has been the BIGGEST problem, Republican members who think they're WAY smarter than Trump and they muck everything up, sir.
@piersmorgan @KyleKashuv @Ross_Greer @GMB I'm sorry, couldn't understand your British metaphors. Gingerbread, what?
@alexburnsNYT @maggieNYT Reminder to "professional journalists" the truth is @SpeakerPelosi is -19 for her loopy #shutdown performance. 49% DISapproval. Of course it's only one poll, but it resonates with me. #tinklebell
@AmericaRising17 @Stopcheckinonme @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats The problem is it is a threat to the Constitution, simply because many in the world resent the United States and would undermine its Constitution. Without that we are lost. That is the threat. And of course it's insidious, proceeding in a gradual, subtle way with harmful effects
@AmericaRising17 @Stopcheckinonme @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats Personally, my grandfather Douglas Henderson was a matador in Mexico and Central America. You can find it on ebay. I, like my grandfather, love the Mexican people and was born in New Mexico. But we need to honor the border.
@AmericaRising17 @Stopcheckinonme @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats For the longest time the governments of Sweden and Norway wouldn't allow emigration to the U.S. Then they got to cold Minnesota. So here we are. It's not a race thing and that's what's wrong of blacks to pretend it's all about race. Very divisive.
@NewsHourExtra @NewsHour 49% disapproval for @SpeakerPelosi's little smirk there.
@KenPaxtonTX @diana_west_ @TXsecofstate Why do critics say this is a "lie"? They say @JohnCornyn is lying. Pretty big story, which #faknews is not touching now. Is it possible it's surname confusion?
@hughhewitt @tombrokaw @BuonicontiFund With all due respect, @tombrokaw this is the big difference between you and @POTUS. He stands his ground and you....melt. The Grand Poobah melting smh. @brithume
@hughhewitt @tombrokaw @BuonicontiFund I already told @tombrokaw he is correct, EXCEPT that American hispanics ALREADY work very  hard at both assimilation AND contribution. BTW, #svenskarnasdag is coming SOON! Put it on your calendar.
Praise God! @Franklin_Graham @JerryFalwellJr https://t.co/2PMGi35BoM
This SHOULD be the most-read column.@MinnesotaDFL remember that @BarackObama, anti-American, deleted the question from the United States Census. Put it back. #ysos? https://t.co/EaFj5c6eJa
@SamanthaJPower @dandrezner @RefugeeAssist You're a sham, #Shamantha. It's not a ban, for one, and you know you're lying. Someone pay you to do this?
@WalshFreedom Stand down, Joe. He's right. You're wrong, "courts" can't stop the wall from getting built. @LindseyGrahamSC
Looks like @amyklobuchar is rolling out her #skyisfalling campaign for prez..... https://t.co/VRLptLvrng
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Another great question by @LindseyGrahamSC. Answer is yes. However, I don't believe any of the states would allow that politically. Can't see California doing it anytime soon. Or Arizona. Not New Mexico. The invasion has already occurred and @TheDemocrats WANT border to crumble
@thehill Might be a good idea for those states, like Minnesota, that were admitted to the Union later. ESPECIALLY #California.
Absolutely spot on again, @LindseyGrahamSC. I would support a national emergency if @SpeakerPelosi wants to drive her negatives up to the sky because she thinks she's pretty. https://t.co/GM6YkADJuh
Yes, you are right, @LindseyGrahamSC. A #fairdeal https://t.co/bAq1flETEx
@bpolitics Not very presidential by @SenWarren
@FixTheCourt @HouseJudiciary What idiots. Can I say that?
@AnandWrites @JoyAnnReid Thinks business is a "field". smh
@NYDailyNews 49% disapproval for @SpeakerPelosi
@JTHVerhovek @rickklein @KamalaHarris @MikeBloomberg @SherrodBrown @JohnKDelaney @SenGillibrand Bueller? Bueller? Bueller? Klobuchar? Klobuchar? Klobuchar? Your "acclamation" is waiting...
@courtneyknorris @NewsHour Note, Courtney, that @SpeakerPelosi has 49% disapproval, a -19 deficit, because of her, uh, stupidity, during the #shutdown2019. I wouldn't be prancing around at this point #PrancingNancy
@politico I'm a fair man @tombrokaw. Yes, you are RIGHT, American hispanics DO need to work harder to assimilate. But they work a lot harder than you know, maybe you spend too much time in California, and they assimilate AND contribute a lot. Don't just kowtow, learn and teach.
@nytimes So?
Yes, @RealJamesWoods is correct, and if @MinnesotaDFL could, under their current leadership @kenmartin73 they'd have a #MinnesotaVoterQuota all set up for them, to further cap white males from voting to "nominate" @amyklobuchar https://t.co/sSfDYEWQ5n
@ColumbiaBugle @gatewaypundit Well, that's what Willie Brown tells all his girls to say.
@washingtonpost First of all, WaPo, he's one of the greatest TV personalities ever, okay? So, yeah, he's a great guide. You, on the  other hand are dying #FakeNewsMedia
@b_stahl Check out A18-1380 review of @MinnesotaDHS cancelling women in #MABC @MedicaidGov coverage and treating them and household as Schweiker Medicaid recipients See Schweiker v. Hogan @USSupremeCourt 1982. Women are DYING because of this Minnesota practice
@rolandsmartin @TeamJeffries @TJMShow @SpeakerPelosi was the most unpopular with 49% disapproval for #shutdown. Now @potus WILL get his wall.
Being shadow-banned by the superior minds at @twitter again. Basically, some college grads just don't like conversation that they don't shine in. They want to shut people up. Look at the results of shutting up the voters. National parties out of control. Lighten up.
@JonPeters1976 @nytimes @DukeU First of all I'm not an ass. Secondly, my understanding is they're not being told not to speak. Please look at details. Encouraging to speak English is not bad. My native language is Minnesotan. When I studied in Taiwan I spoke all the Chinese I could.
So there's a lot of price reductions, @davidfrum we need to learn more about this.
See @davidfrum this is the chart I was referring to. The foods chiefs statement is interesting but I'd like to see the numbers.
@JohnWDean @JohnWDean panics about possible third-party candidates. LOL
@politico She's the most unpopular figure in the #shutdown2019
So this is Trevor Bates @Lions player. @NFL needs to discipline him. I'm sure I read about a fine from @nflcommish. @9_tjb I like your faith, but you really need to apologize for this. #triggered https://t.co/9B4gneFrEd
@SBANYPD I'm sorry, where in the statement is there a single reference to race?? If that's what happened that's what happened. And don't try to get out of by claiming "race".
@nytimes Was the @nfl player arrested?
@thehill Well @SpeakerPelosi disapproval shot up to 49% during her little antics in the #shutdown. So @HillaryClinton can beat her now.
@CillizzaCNN Chris doesn't like this. He only likes to share HIS "truth" and frowns on the notion of truth in the first place. ('If truth is free what the heck am I going to do for a living?? Mom!' )
What this means is that with @SpeakerPelosi soaring UNpopularity because of latest #tinklecontest performance on #TheWall the pressure will become intense for her to negotiate with @potus or else @collinpeterson and #BlueDogs will have to get her OUTTA THERE!! @TinaSmithMN https://t.co/xiVyDjwpKY
@thehill @secupp LOL. This is why I don't put myself with the "conservative" crowd, because people like you just decide to let your brain stop functioning whenever you want because you think you're a great "conservative". I eschew the political dichotomy.
@washingtonpost This is a contradiction in terms: "unity" and "blunt talk about race". She would try to be racist @BarackObama on steroids.
@realDonaldTrump @60Minutes You're right! @HowardSchultz is a WUSS! He'll never run. Probably will go to work for @SpeakerPelosi the most unpopular #shutdown figure.
@davidfrum So that's part of the answer to my  question earlier, looking at a bloomberg chart, I believe, and trade news that the prices of food have been going down. So I'm wondering whether they will cut supply? This seems to suggest they want to. Want to know more.
Are you listening @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN? https://t.co/NPaxdt4LWh
She didn't win the shutdown. And this is the beginnning of the end for @TheDemocrats majority in @HouseFloor for #Election2020. Kiss it goodbye! @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN https://t.co/FEbIMthpUQ
@HotlineJosh So @amyklobuchar this is what you get for supporting @SpeakerPelosi. Just get the #fairdeal with Trump and bring your little Pelosi-lover @TinaSmithMN with you. @MinnesotaDFL
@rolmeda @rolandsmartin @tombrokaw Tom, the news guy, is simply uninformed on this. And what's going to happen on the border is with real border security, we'll have investment and community on both sides of #theWall of @potus and we'll have better good neighbor relations as the #treatyofgualupehidalgo intended.
I disagree with @tombrokaw's "I also happen to believe that the Hispanics should work harder at assimilation." Hispanics do assimilate very nicely, Tom and work very hard at it. Are an important part of the U.S. @GOP have no problem with this. @MinnesotaDFL @IndyMN
@Newsweek I thought she worked for the district attorney.
Ironically I think #tinklebell @SpeakerPelosi's little hate strategy with @AdamSchiff @RepAdamSchiff is going to backfire. #fakenews gets in such a tizzy they can't hear their own @potus candidates for #Election2020! @realDonaldTrump keeps his eye on the ball though. https://t.co/6AWNcTs6Bz
@Slate Nixon was a great president. I attended a @Macalester meeting of the Quaker friends in 1969. Talking with them I was surprised to learn Richard Nixon was a Quaker, you know, a peacenik. I was very interested in the Vietnam War at the time, having just graduated high school...
@amyklobuchar's politburo friends. Make sure to check her name off for prez, sure. Prosecutorial tactics. #KirbyPuckett look out! https://t.co/7DZXVI4JUU
@K_JeanPierre @LawProfButler @MSNBC So you like your little black "grand jury" in DC, don't you? Kind of uncivilized in my estimation.
@OrinKerr Here's a "law professor" comparing Roger Stone to a criminal gang. #ysos?
@Amy_Siskind I don't know. Why does anyone allow you to air your views? They're facile and biased, part of a political gender-based agenda. This is America.
@CNNPolitics Will the bigoted black DC anti-American "grand jury" in DC indict Corsi? 100% certain. But showing interest in getting information on @wikileaks next releases is hardly collusion with Russia. @HillaryClinton @amyklobuchar fail here, and they should give it up. What losers.
@JoyceWhiteVance @BarbMcQuade @USATODAY I'm just a former @USSenate nominee from Minnesota. But it's clear to me that @HillaryClinton is in the weeds on this one, and the @DNC and #RobertMueller look pathetic in trying to explain why Hillary's loss was some kind of "Russian" plot. STOP already! What's the purpose here?
By Schweiker recipients of @MedicaidGov we mean "wealthier" Soc.Sec. recipients who seek to access Medicaid dollars by spending their income down with medical bills @E_J_Piper. in 1967 Cong forced them to 80% poverty level. @keithellison @TonyLourey @GovTimWalz @KamalaHarris #ap
Essentially we are going to argue to @keithellison that @TonyLourey @GovTimWalz are classifying married #breastcancer patients on MA-BC as "Schweiker recipients" when they hit 65 cancelling their treatment, risking their lives. @KamalaHarris study this. SERIOUS health disparity
So....this might be a GOOD thing  #Brexit has done. It appears that the British people themselves could buy more food. Apparently as exports are cut. Missing here is whether demand supports the same levels of food production and other essentials. @MinnesotaDFL @UKIPPreston https://t.co/TItpxrURcX
From my observation as a newspaper editor, "corporate news" has NEVER covered the news and its reporters are almost exclusively incapable of covering, writing or disseminating the news. They NEVER write anything more than a pre-determined angle. https://t.co/Ofzoq1UnL5
@AlecMacGillis @Graniteprof Mine was more or less lost in 1994 and I went into corporate America. In 1994 I decided not to continue a newspaper I founded, because of the internet--couldn't proceed to put a paper newspaper on the streets.
I'd like to think Brady does have a #MAGA in his locker. I'd watch the @SuperBowl if he did. https://t.co/bLBhl02e0L
@nytimes @DukeU should not apologize for this. Speaking English would be very helpful for the education of the Chinese. When I studied in Taiwan I spoke Chinese as much as possible. You get a lot more out of it, and likely won't have the same opportunity again back in your home country.
I agree with @realDonaldTrump about @FoxNews. The problem is the #FakeNews. The sub-par @BarackObama attacked Fox because he couldn't understand this country and he blamed Fox after he shadily bumped out @HillaryClinton. But they're no oracle of truth for sure. Must SEARCH. https://t.co/aBjdKDIsB4
@CBSNews Kids today....won't get out of their moms' basements. No, wait, better alert #RobertMueller! Ruissians!
@washingtonpost How much of your #21days are you going to waste on this self-congratulation?
@JackPosobiec @stranahan @CassandraRules Or...he felt Checkers had been abused in the press.
@mattdpearce @JoyAnnReid Uhhhh... maybe #TheWall is part of the plan....@realDonaldTrump
@CarmineZozzora @diana_west_ @DonaldJTrumpJr @kimguilfoyle @EricTrump @LouDobbs @SebGorka When the @cia director @JohnBrennan is a traitor to the Constitution. What do you call that?
@Newsweek @AnnCoulter start making sense. This time @potus has to have national guard or active duty ready to replace @TSA if they don't work during emergency, so the airlines can't shut down. It's easy to nationalize airport security completely when @SpeakerPelosi gets froggy.
@JoyAnnReid BS. What do you know about it? You just want their money.
@ArthurSchwartz So can I call @RepJeffries the black whiz kid?
@RepGregoryMeeks And to stop anti-semitism in @MinnesotaDFL and @DNC
@nloquendi @jonallendc @kasie @neeratanden So Tanden would be @HillaryClinton
@zerohedge @diana_west_ So I'm tellin' you @SpeakerPelosi you are attempting to undermine a people's tradition in this country because you think, like other people I know in #sanfrancisco that you can SILENCE @potus to keep your #openborders. You are wrong.
@zerohedge @diana_west_ Remove @SpeakerPelosi from the position, please @collinpeterson and your merry band of #bluedogs
@JacobAWohl @diana_west_ So is this a #MeToo moment?
I agree, and I'm thankful he's reconsidered. I hope these kids are treated right. #CovingtonCatholicHigh https://t.co/MyCg9l1Iw1
@tedlieu @JoeConason Ted you should talk about the Jews, who were targeted simply because they were Jews, not because they competed for power with Hitler.
@rollcall #fairdeal is all, @SpeakerPelosi. If you don't within #21days we'll watch @potus destroy you as he builds #theWall. I know that's not too subtle. But then neither are you.
@jmsummers @kronayne @KamalaHarris "Everything I know I learned from Willie." He can do anything.
Should be @HillaryClinton indicted over them but #RobertMueller is her boy. https://t.co/dAJtBVKV3u
@thehill Ah! Now we know it must have been @HillaryClinton who leaked the Willie Brown stuff on her rival @KamalaHarris. That would be an interesting debate.
@Newsweek I believe the word is "whupped", @LouDobbs. But if you said this (check source) you are wrong. It ain't over til it's over #21days.
@BeschlossDC Can you imagine what @SpeakerPelosi or @iamcardib would do if @potus did this? Or what #fakenews would say? Or Rod Rosenstein?
@Veteran4Trump @SpeakerPelosi commie.
@WashTimes Thank you Chris Pratt.
@DanJukes17 @PrisonPlanet @Michael_Heaver Drink water.
@joelpollak Certainly Hitler had a dedicated, high-profile propaganda and genocide campaign against Jews. @TheDemocrats need to recognize that. @SpeakerPelosi
@jonallendc @kasie What rival is attacking her?
@jmartNYT @ccadelago @cmarinucci Willie Brown
@mjs_DC @maggieNYT They don't have "direct knowledge". Philosopher you're not.
@HotlineJosh Well I know, they don't let you talk.
@latimes Willie Brown
@politico Oh, you mean to yell at @potus?
@thehill #21days and counting. You think your #fakenews plays with the American people?
@keith___m @dale_e_ho @jbendery @JohnCornyn Well, so there's the explanation then. @JohnCornyn is a liar. Alright.
@RepAdamSchiff @BlueNationUntd Your "ideas" that candidates and presidents should have no contact with Russia are ridiculous, Adam.
@Alyssa_Milano @BlueNationUntd Yes, @twitter gives you freedom of expression, Alyssa Milano. You're really crazy though. You're having an internal dialogue with your safe-seat district an echo chamber.
@thecjpearson Just critically analyze all the people you DO follow and you'll be good.
@dale_e_ho @jbendery Well it's not "false" Dale. @JohnCornyn has discussed this. Is he a liar?
@WDAYnews Why not?
@sairasameerarao Yeah, such amazing insights.
@jkcarnah you can't attract #twincities women to @mngop from @MinnesotaDFL for the simple reason that @kenmartin73 @TinaSmithMN and company cap men, cap white men to WAY under 50% more like 35% to 40%. GIVES their party to the white women. They love it. Unconstitutional though
@gatewaypundit Okay, she's toast. @KamalaHarris
@gatewaypundit Serious? Show me the evidence.
@esmemurphy plays with funny Brooklyn numbers to question whether #Openborders is an emergency. Then calls Trump a "wimp". Uh-huh, Esme.
@JimHagedornMN announces that @potus will probably re-program money from @DeptofDefense and @DHSgov to #BuildTheWallNow.
@SpeakerPelosi I KNOW you don't have better ideas than @potus on border security. I think America knows you don't either, but most simply don't care. That's where you make your money.
Right https://t.co/lYqD9n0DH3
@FaceTheNation @SenatorCollins Susan is running for re-election, is a target, and has to be pretty tough.
@margbrennan doesn't want to hear El Paso mayor describe his security  concerns. She breaks in, just wants to know "is it a crisis". I'm different than #fakenews because I DO want to hear from the mayor. See? @twitter monitors and @fbi are the same, care about politics only.
@FaceTheNation @SenatorCollins But, @SenatorCollins you're not the president. If you WERE the @potus we'd have open borders. Let @realDonaldTrump handle it. If you fail, your party fails, then you will not be a worthwhile party. Yes, generally Republicans say things and don't do them. Let him do it.
I'll explain @FaceTheNation as a political candidate myself why someone in the campaign would want to stay on top of @wikileaks. It's like @BillClinton get out ahead of the news cycle. If wikileaks releases, and your adversary gets it first, it will hurt your campaign. Want to c
@RepDebHaaland I agree with #NathanPhillips that he should have a dialogue with the @CovingtonCatho2 #CovingtonBoys
@SpeakerPelosi used "immoral" in a #tinklecontest with @realDonaldTrump. So she's got it all over her.
I think @RameshPonnuru we'll see #BorderSecurity rise higher than page 14 this year as @DHSgov and @realDonaldTrump revisit this. The other issues are VERY high. I don't like #fakenews running down our security but you make $$$$ doing that. Until your job is gone.,
So in other words, @FaceTheNation @margbrennan what @SpeakerPelosi "won" because her polls went up for suffering of 800K federal workers. Keep that thought. Don't move off it and deny it. THIS is what thrills some in @MinnesotaDFL. NOT me.
I'll tell you why your idea of just shutting down @DHSgov isn't a good idea, @JoeManchinWV. Really? Do I have to? Because many @HouseFloor @TheDemocrats like the appointed @Ilhan would LOVE to weaken our national security. @RashidaTlaib @RepJeffries @RepMaxineWaters @TinaSmithMN
@JoeManchinWV has idea of a 10-year time for path to citizenship for #daca instead of 3-year time. Still temporary, but MIGHT weaken @SpeakerPelosi
@margbrennan pretends she has an "argument" saying 'you say it's an emergency but you're going to wait three more weeks.' Honestly thinks this is highly sophisticated "thinking".
@margbrennan pretends not to understand that Republicans could trust @TheDemocrats could be telling the truth when they said, "just open the government and we'll negotiate, honest!"
I'll be watching @CBS on the other side.
@Yamiche blaming @POTUS for "possibly misrepresenting" where drugs are coming across the border. This is "journalism" for her. No I won't give you a lesser standard, you are not reporting facts but what you wish were facts.
@kwelkernbc I'll teach you. I'm @potus supporter and you are clueless. Listen. We see you attacking our national security, and @SpeakerPelosi doing so tinling on #thewall (that's legal in California). #election2020 is coming to wipe these @HouseDemocrats OUT and #maga. Get it? no
Oh great another round of hate from the @chucktodd panel.
So @chucktodd says he's kicking @realDonaldTrump. I guess some loser @TheDemocrats like @amyklobuchar think saying that makes them "winners" while they edge toward another #shutdown #shutdown2 on @SpeakerPelosi supporters.
@Twitter has no problem with @RepJeffries calling @realDonaldTrump "Grand Wizard" and #mueller "Individual 1." Hey, but that is Jack's game plan. Hire these people to overthrow the government.
So "evidence-based" is what @RepJeffries sees himself and his master @SpeakerPelosi stopping #TheWall and stopping the funding of the government. Oh, and he's taking "hard looks" at legislation you can't take federal employees hostage. Cheerleader.
Bets on when @RepJeffries breaks into a song support Maduro.
I don't support @RepJeffries. Here's the commie front.
Amazed that @GOPLeader could not throw up  while saying "oh, it's a PLEASURE" to be here with @chucktodd
@Jason2CD and @ErikPaulsen I DO blame you. I'm glad you're out. Now we have until #Election2020 to get a stronger Congress and keep #MAGA
@GOPLeader is doing an excellent job of explaining the problems in the @USHouseNews @HouseFloor. America is with McCarthy on this. No, YOU look, @chucktodd you think you're a performer, you are an America hater but you are a hard mac down for the buck.
@GOPLeader is correct @SpeakerPelosi PRETENDED to want DACA. She didn't get it because she's a liar, now she's on to @Ilhan and @RashidaTlaib
My @twitter is still restricted. But @chucktodd opinion page is loud on national TV. What's so disgusting is for all the "pain" he pretended to have to #shutdown now he is crowing.  Almost puked, Chuck.
@thehill There's no doubt @RepSwalwell that Americans were intensely interested in the criminal and deadly activity of @HillaryClinton that she and @BarackObama and his crew sought desperately to hide for the course of the election. @amyklobuchar We found out through @wikileaks
@USATODAY @USATODAY is obviously ignorant of Bible literacy.
@washingtonpost #21days to a #fairdeal happen now, class.
@CBSNews Yeah, he's a "cheater" just like @POTUS is a "cheater". He WINS!
@NRO Maybe....STUDY? Stop marching around hating Western Civilization and study, and learn the corpus of knowledge. THEN advance it! @SteveKingIA
Okay remember this phrase that @amyklobuchar is in: "hot, deep soup of the Russia scandal". As an affirmative action quota "winner" of @MinnesotaDFL nominations after having got out of her @HennepinAtty position where she prosecuting #KirbyPuckett for sexual assault (smh), now... https://t.co/v4NtUsAqpU
@nytimes In other words, and illegal fishing expedition against the @potus. @RudyGiuliani @AlanDersh
@TinaSmithMN @brianschatz @SherrodBrown So are they going to get paid for work they didn't do? If that's true I would oppose it. However, what YOU should be doing Tina is making sure @amyklobuchar and you support a #fairdeal to avoid another #shutdown after the #21days @potus gave you.
@NBCNews @rolandsmartin The Duke official is correct. I have no problem with Chinese students speaking Chinese. When I was in China I was happy to speak as much Chinese as possible in order to learn more. Grow up Roland.
So @GovMarkDayton and @TinaSmithMN you like to praise "Madame" Pelosi. What's going on here, @MinnesotaDFL? Obviously you have no common sense as you launch this @Ilhan attack against the U.S. And of course she's on @SpeakerPelosi foreign affairs committee. Disgrace. https://t.co/0mcbusQV4L
@TinaSmithMN Narcissistic women not caring about human trafficking of other women, mouths taped shut, across the border. Disgraceful, #tinklebell, this is no #tinklecontest. Your #21Days are ticking away and you must make a #fairdeal. smh @SpeakerPelosi
@rollcall That look where @SpeakerPelosi realizes she needs to up with a #fairdeal in the next #21days or @potus will roll over her.
@rolandsmartin @charliekirk11 Au contraire, Roland, ALL OF US care about this. Just not you, you only love your "show."
@KatiePhang Again, in #21days you're going to be a funding bill, signed by @potus. Are you focusing on that yet? Or haven't your editors told you to do that?
@rollcall Maybe it needs to be longer, @SpeakerPelosi little miss "winner." But the funding lasts 3 weeks. You better get the smirk off your face.
@dannagal @dandrezner I'm a political scientist and I say they're NOT essential. So you think YOU'RE equipped to choose the best person for the job? No you're not. Neither is #fakenews.
@davidaxelrod So I GUESS you realize @realDonaldTrump has to approve any more funding for @SpeakerPelosi after #21days, correct? So you're mocking and talking about #tinklebell's power. You're way off, Axelrod.
@DMRegister I have to tell you something you apparently don't understand or aren't telling your readers--the funding only lasts THREE WEEKS--#21days. So you say "ending the shutdown" that really doesn't occur until more funding is provided. So you figure that out with @SpeakerPelosi alright?
@davidaxelrod Well, Axelrod I see you think you have so much money and spread so much ignorance on #fakenews that YOU are going to do the reckoning on @realDonaldTrump. I see you facing a reckoning day, sir. I sense your hate and no you have no basis, you will learn....
@AbdulElSayed @vets4bernie So?
@JaxAlemany I won't comment to you further, so you're one-way.
Okay @twitter you win, I switch to @facebook for a bit.
This is why @realDonaldTrump could win because he had the money to communicate without being blocked by so-called "free" social media like @twitter. And why we LOVE @potus and detest #FakeNewsMedia
I would draw @twitter attention to a @facebook case that prohibited free speech about the work of public officials. I would definitely supporting extending that legal precedent against Twitter suppression of free speech.
So remember: @twitter hires people who watch your tweets and won't allow you question the basic intelligence of people calling themselves media. @noamchomskyT correctly defined the propagandistic function of media to limit statements like this that can't be uttered.
My @twitter restricted 24 hours because I questioned the presence of intelligence in #fakenews who said @SteveKingIA made "racist comments." Of course the fakenews won't come out and argue. This is called propaganda and twitter 1984. I get it.
@JaxAlemany @PhilipRucker He didn't make any "racist comments" you idiot.
@thehill Stronger than what?
@davidaxelrod @BetoORourke It appears to be around the bend.
@thehill He never made remarks on that. Those were the reporters words. He talked about that type of language. You're liars.
@washingtonpost They might be equally stupid as your #fakenews "reporters." For in fact the #21days is running and Trump will veto anything that's not a #fairdeal. You can call that what you wish. Soon you'll have to admit it. Your trash...
@davidhogg111 Hey @Harvard dumbo, he did not discuss white supremacy. Notice how that's not in quotes. It's a dishonest #faknews "paraphrasing." If you think you'll be a real student, you need to go beyond fake news.
@carolmswain @EpochTimes That's true.
@WSJ #ysos? Wear 'em.
@thehill That might have been @AnnCoulter advice to #RonaldReagan but she would be wrong.
@rudnicknoah She didn't "end" anything. She's got #21Days already running until the funding runs out.Then faces @potus veto of any weak stuff.
@jonfavs @JenVerhagen Well dumbo you say for nothing. Your #21Days are running. You don't make a #fairdeal, RIGHT NOW, @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN and @potus VETOS any attempt to continue your song and dance about the border. Eventually even the #fakenews @StarTribune will report this.
@BostonGlobe @BostonGlobe is #fakenews. They drink too much beer and smoke dope. Because they can't stand the stress of their work and their lies.
@CBSNews Try to focus here, @cbs. There is #21DAYS of funding, and the clock is ticking right now. Unless @SpeakerPelosi is going to override @potus veto. So you decide. But stop lying to your viewers, you insult the intelligence of Americans.
@stephenfhayes Trying to pretend you have a story LOL
@TPNN_ThePoint Think SHE's a charlatan, @piersmorgan? Wait until you get around to @Ilhan!
Probably a real important development. https://t.co/xVYFY97FSH
@alexburnsNYT @jmartNYT @GovLarryHogan @maggieNYT Guess you have to say this or you lose your job Alex. LOL
@politico The funding is for #21days
@thehill Uh-huh
@KatiePhang How big is the U.S. economy Katie?
@PrisonPlanet @gatewaypundit They get brainwashed into believing political narratives to they actually believe it. Their work is insidious.
@KatiePhang Are you even AWARE, Katie, that the new shutdown is already baked into the three-week funding agreement? I mean the way you #fakenews guys reported you think it's ended. WHY do you misinform America in the way you do?
@KurtSchlichter I already said it. They've become the New @TheDemocrats Politburo.
This is a good point. So @amyklobuchar what kind of fascism are you supporting now? Gestapo SWAT teams on political opponents? You REEK. @TinaSmithMN And you think because you're a woman we're going to make you PRESIDENT? Don't make me laugh. https://t.co/PaZnRuOopK
@WSJ @wjmcgurn I think it's wonderful @SecondLady
@dandrezner @Grace_Segers these were the numbers from the Obama administration. You just are so clueless you never heard them before. You people are joking around about human sex slavery. Sexual assault. Rape. Real funny, isn't it, Dan? You need to cool your jets.
@dandrezner Oh I watched his Town Hall @grace_segers. And he makes very clear, "thread", that he was asked a question with the words by a reporter, he did not discuss them. He discussed languaged associated with Western Civilization. And criticizes @GOPLeader for not defending it.
@nytpolitics See the deadline is baked into the agreement. @SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer will have to get another bill past the @USSenate and past @realDonaldTrump. So her little dancing and bowing is just plain stupid.
@KurtSchlichter @Uncle_Jimbo @LarryOConnor What I think #NathanPhillips does in Washington is honor the many, many American Indians who we know HAVE served with loyalty to our country. Not that he himself is a hero. We should not attack him with the sins of the #fakenews. I didn't hear him make these remarks.
@KurtSchlichter What #PrancingNancy @SpeakerPelosi is trying to do here is to normalize the language of @Ilhan when she said @LindseyGrahamSC is compromised because he's single.
This kind of attack is what YOU, @amyklobuchar little miss prosecutor, support. @TinaSmithMN @MinnesotaDFL https://t.co/8nH0g814st
@PJMedia_com He didn't end the #shutdown, he held it in abeyance by agreeing to sign three-week funding. The new shutdown is already baked in, if there is no #fairdeal
@Newsweek @newsweek YOU are racist, and ignorant, and you don't cover what @SteveKingIA actually SAYS.
That's rich, Mr. Smirk himself @billmaher attacking a high school student for smirking. https://t.co/u57R7hCQxG
@bindersab @Graniteprof @monkeycageblog The #shutdown has not ended. Don't parse effects. There is a #21DAYS respite, which you should try to open your sophisticated brain to comprehend. Otherwise you're way off, your academic work is just not credible if you get down to this level.
@costareports @Graniteprof @AOC Actually that's all @SpeakerPelosi DOES do, and she'll be eliminated from the role. Now is a great test for her, you too, @aoc. You have #21DAYS not to show off your cliche dance steps but to produce.
@SteveKingIA @stranahan @GOPLeader you represent the same kind of insipid Catholicism that attacked the #CovingtonCatholicBoys because they were exposed to EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF EXTREMISM you are mindlessly backing. Now get to work to #BuildTheWallNow
@SteveKingIA @stranahan I strongly disagree with @GOPLeader cynical attacks on Rep. King and the #1stamendment
Trust but verify is no easy task with @SpeakerPelosi (#PrancingNancy) or @SenSchumer https://t.co/U73Mocfo5d
Mexicans manufacture a new automobile. We can work with Mexico as good neighbors, but #BuildTheWall to secure the border. So both nations can work. @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN @MinnesotaDFL https://t.co/8LOK4Yi6z5
@TeaPartyNevada @gatewaypundit That's right we hate these people for playing with our country. @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN @HillaryClinton @BarackObama. We are #MAGA. #fakenews
@GrayConnolly @SebGorka To overturn the #Election2016 after the remnants of @BarackObama, the @FBI staged a ritual overseen by this anti-American Obama himself (yes @MicheleBachmann and I would have SAID so on @HardballChris) to attack our Constitution (it's more clear in hindsight, Michele).
@GrayConnolly @SebGorka The @FBI is anti-American trash backed by the likes of political hustlers @amyklobuchar and @TinaSmithMN. @POTUS needs to be supported in depoliticizing and reformed these stooges.
Basically @potus these are the military tactics our enemies in Mexico use to attack our people with  drug addiction. @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN do you disagree? Are you on the side of our enemies? @MinnesotaDFL https://t.co/EUHH1nn3yy
@mmcauliff @rolandsmartin Roland still hatin'. I'm SO impressed.
#21Days That's what you have for your shuckin' and jivin' @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN. Wanna play? You said you backed the Wall. Because as a trained lawyer, @SenAmyKlobuchar you're schooled to lie with no compunction. A disgrace to our land. @SenSanders https://t.co/pHkBVWjipa
@amprog @TheDursoIsIn @BarackObama was an anti-American freak to have started this attack on our military and national security. That's the little smartass with the smirk. Thinks he's a real bright boy.
@amprog You people are clearly idiots. There are #21Days for you foolish people to prance around and sing with #PrancingNancy and then the reckoning comes. Get moving.
@DailySignal @SebGorka #SecularHumanism is stupid. It's not that it shouldn't be in school. But students must be allowed to attack it.
@amyklobuchar No. Violates #2ndAmendment duh. #BuildTheWall
@barbvas @TwiggDaddy @AidenWolfe @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SenWarren Well, I don't think your wishes will come true on @potus. I wrote this piece to fight cancer. https://t.co/rXs9gUje0A #fightlikeagirl
@TwiggDaddy @AidenWolfe @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @SenWarren He's already got full Republican support. Let's her your next idea.
@ABCPolitics @rickklein Once again your D-ass show gets the story wrong. It is #21Days and your so-called "reporter" deliberately leaves that out. That is idiotic, sorry.
No fair! https://t.co/ofSZbcHOzI
@BostonGlobe You have an irresponsible newspaper, just sayin'
This is very rough. #Homeless Yes I see this. I know the homeless, I worked for the U.S. Census at @ListeningHouse and I know people are going through this. This is the welfare state. These men are not allowed by law to get welfare, you have to be a woman. GIVE him toothpaste! https://t.co/NoxUXysQ90
@woodruffbets Service animal. Lawmakers take service dogs away from passengers because others complain. I like the service animals, but I think that's what he's talking about.
@woodruffbets Well, there has been an unfair attack on service animals that I don't agree with. But what does this have to do with Russia, etc. #RobertMueller
@johnpodesta Hey John! You're PERFECTLY free to spill the whole truth, nothing but the truth at any moment. Don't let #RobertMueller stop you. So, go, what is it you have to say? Not your opinion, the facts.
@ajc That's pretty good. But you're not supposed to do that. Get it together.
@WLTX Nerds
@thehill Actually @thehill that's NOT correct. #ItsNotOverTilTheWallisBuilt!
@DailySignal Look I know what it's like to work minimum wage. I aided people in wheelchairs at a major #MSP airport for $7.25 an hour, and did security for $5.65 an hour. #KirbyPuckett persecutor @amyklobuchar never did because she knows how to lie and is willing. But we need #freemarket econ
@AaronBlake No, @AaronBlake only if YOU and your #fakenews buddies want it to happen. You're such a little defensive narcissistic you're already prepare defense strategies for when you AGAIN throw the nation into chaos and party with the low-life non-entities that call themselves "press."
@wcti12 @GKButterfield @mnewellWCTI12 If you don't fix the border in #21Days with a #fairdeal @potus will have to get a national emergency plan to ensure they will not sick out.
@TEC_newspaper @GKButterfield @realDonaldTrump @flypgv @HouseDemocrats You BETTER secure the border in #21Days or the President will have to do it. @potus
@realDonaldTrump Thank you for firing @Comey! I can't believe @amyklobuchar who first got famous for persecuting #KirbyPuckett, is proud to have been Comey's classmate. SMH
@RadRachelLove Please. It's not hatred. If you want to see hate, watch the "Israelites" on the tape that day, leading up to #NathanPhillips, who they called "Gad", 'a real 'ngr'". You'll see what hate looks like. Don't believe #fakenews. P.S. I'm real smart, refocus.
@vicki_den @MuslimIQ @CovCathColonels Uh, sorry Vicki I LIKE white boys, especially smart ones who care about human life. This is America's BEST and they need to work,and study, to stay the best. @amyklobuchar
@WabKinew I read your video on #NathanPhillips. #BuildTheWall is the right thing to do and I'm proud of the #CovingtonCatholicBoys and they learned a lot that day. I see Nathan wants to have a #dialogue with those students and I welcome that. #MarchForLife2019. Do you know that song he did
Wait! Where's that #kirbypuckett persecutor? You know, the government lawyer @amyklobuchar from #WalterMondale's firm in the liberal Midwest? #Millenials2020 https://t.co/RELGHaoIOP
What are they doing to that poor white man? https://t.co/N71fKInQSs
@AidenWolfe #Election2020 The horse I have in this race is @realDonaldTrump. But I think like @POTUS himself I want to hear cogent ideas from all sides. I won't always agree but as the vote nears we need clarity, and the capacity to act. I need to hear what he says about @SenWarren statemnts
@KennysEyes I do appreciate that @HillaryClinton looks the cup up to her lips in this clip so she does spill that hot coffee all over that nice dress.
THIS is priceless! @alfranken @amyklobuchar look at this. She's got that little "cute" @SpeakerPelosi look. Dear @POTUS DON'T let this happen again after the next #21Days. Don't let #PrancyNancy block a secure border, don't let her divide America for #genderquotas. https://t.co/50stWWc094
@CaccioppoliMike #Election2020 and don't forget those #breastcancer patients on #BCCPTA whose health insurance is cancelled by people like @keithellison BECAUSE they live and need treatment completed. @SenSanders defend THOSE too! #MedicareforAll is not  always enough. @amyklobuchar
#Bernie2020 Don't forget: Your opponent @amyklobuchar was a persecutor. Very famous, took on #KirbyPuckett. Lost the case, of course, but always dangerous. @SenAmyKlobuchar
I have no problem with @SenSanders wiping out  all those other @TheDemocrats "candidates", including the #KirbyPuckett persecutor @amyklobuchar and having an important debate with @POTUS. How will he secure the border  in #21Days? https://t.co/ENwRmq57qp
I know. I look like this all the time. Stopped sitting in stairwells though, people tend to run into me. I hope @SenSanders will thoughtfullty and contemplatively move toward the middle and address the issues @realDonaldTrump PRODUCTIVELY. TALK to the #FakeNews usefully. https://t.co/l3rDahR6Qg
@IndigoTheArtist I'll say this: The presence in the race of @KamalaHarris @SenWarren @CoryBooker and absence of @HillaryClinton as "moderate" frees @BernieSandersWI to be a more centrist candidate against extremes. And address issues @potus is. @StarTribune @duluthnews @PB_News @MPRsMikeMulcahy
@SpeakerPelosi Look you witch. If you play with this and don't get a #FairDeal for @potus, YOU will be responsible when @realDonaldTrump declares a national https://t.co/LTIK3c6eIa still think it's a game. You need to be removed if you don't act @SpeakerPelosi
@ChatByCC @SebGorka Well of course it's an emotional issue.
@peterwallsten @PhilipRucker @jdawsey1 @seungminkim That is absolutely true of @SpeakerRyan and also @Jason2CD and Erick Paulsen. Thought they were cute, didn't get what's happening.
@thehill Oh sure, "former state ag." Pathetic.
@SebGorka @thechrisbuskirk @theamgreatness I absolutely do NOT trust the @fbi.
@claynmiddleton @SpeakerPelosi @LeaderHoyer @WhipClyburn Yeah, like you got experience duh.
@Reddy @dandrezner @burgessev @AndrewRestuccia So here's the deal @robportman you know you were hung out on a vote, and people WILL and should remember. Now you have to stick with your vote, and move for the wall in 21 days. If Congress can't act, @potus will. Now's your time to work. You liked Dem plan? Sell it then.
@peoplefor @claynmiddleton @SpeakerPelosi @TeamPelosi @civilrightsorg @cmclymer @Public_Citizen @LambdaLegal @womensmarch @HRC @OurRevolution @AFJustice @SEIU @SpeakerPelosi is elevated far above her vain ability. Now she has to deliver. I will bet on @realDonaldTrump to deliver. Her conceitedness has undermined her credibility, she's stuck with the crazies. She'll lose speakership.
@washingtonpost They should apologize TO the students, and support them in a dialogue with American Indian Movement.
@jdawsey1 @PhilipRucker But you're careful never to print a word of truth. So your #fakenews is good for birdie cages. I'll find the news online. Not from you. You're a sideshow.
@theblaze @andrewcuomo IS excommunicated. He is no Catholic. He's lucifer.
@politico Nope, you missed the story, again.
@maggieNYT He hasn't lost @LouDobbs. So you tryin' to "sting" people, hey big-shot pro?
@thehill So how does that rip @potus? What am I missing here? @LouDobbs you agree you "ripped @realDonaldTrump"?
@claynmiddleton @GOP I seriously doubt that you have ANY coherent interpretation of the facts, or even the facts. So stop the political preening.
@CBSNews @DavidBegnaud Right but now @SpeakerPelosi and @chuckschumer are prancing around like juveniles.
Thank you @LindseyGrahamSC that is the truth. I think he will. So for ATC, we'll have trained, loyal military, including TSA replacements as necessary. https://t.co/dizKpJSQ7R
@maggieNYT @peterbakernyt Smug Baker misses the call. I don't ever read Baker.
@ron_fournier @ktumulty So to you this woman does not look like an idiot? I mean seriously I'm looking at this photo.
@MariaTCardona You will learn what it means if your moronic friend @SpeakerPelosi continues to prance around like a little con artist. I hope she can be removed as speaker as part of this resolution. She is to blame for bringing the nation to the brink of ruin.
@abbydphillip @MariaTCardona No it doesn't Abby. It's just that you are illogical and confused and have lost sight of what the issue is. Perfect for #fakenews.
@davidfrum Canada is calling.
Good. I like this. @DalaiLama @Pontifex @Franklin_Graham @JerryFalwellJr https://t.co/sz4zeIu0Dd
@washingtonpost Remember an hour ago when they were sobbing over the 800K. Now they think it's a big joke. No federal employee should put ANY confidence in these conmen.
@washingtonpost Tell me they don't look like idiots.
@MCJalonick @DavidMDrucker This line is the closest to reality I have seen from #fakenews. Except the 30 days, IN CASE YOU MISSED IT MARY, are to resolve it, with proposals already in the air. If another shutdown with national emergency is implemented its on @SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer.
@anniekarni @peterbakernyt The comedian Petey the major pro. America is winning and we're going to #BuildTheWall. You're a cheerleader for foolishness and I never anymore read your crappy publication,. You're IRRELEVANT, enveloped by social media.
@Yamiche @maggieNYT You flatter yourself if you call what you do coverage. Here's the story, pro-tip for you. @LindseyGrahamSC and Blue Dogs in the House convinced @potus to give a try with negotiating with the idiot @SpeakerPelosi out of the way and #BuildTheWall. After that national emergency. DUH
@maggieNYT @SpeakerPelosi is dishonest and erratic. In case the #fakenews hasn't figured that out by now.
@claynmiddleton You haven't even started being civil.
@maggieNYT She needs to be removed. She's destroying the U.S. House @USHouseNews
@bennyjohnson @SebGorka Because Angry Chris Wray is twisted. @fbi is the enemy
@NewsHour @LisaDNews Yeah right braniac.
@kasie I'm pretty sure I don't agree with anything in your underperforming mental faculties.
@Newsweek Yeah right Mr. Magoo
@bunionbutt @SpeakerPelosi She's already a mess.
@KThomasDC @peterbakernyt @peterbakernyt is half-bakered as usual. Totally worthless non-analysis.
@CBSNews @DavidBegnaud So tell your idiot @TheDemocrats "leaders" to quit the games and preening and secure the border like liars like @amyklobuchar used to say they wanted. Wants to be prez but looks like a TOTAL LIAR. @TinaSmithMN is just ridiculously unaware. @MinnesotaDFL
@WSJ He did not back down. So, big business minds you're actually banking that @potus is not going to build that wall? Remember investors are looking at your half-baked BS.
@TalKopan @IanSams Yeah, yeah, Mr. Silly. @JimClyburnSC you never have had the gravitas to pretend to be a national leader. Now you're going to lead the socialism, that's what you think?
You got it. https://t.co/lLL3M5oKRp
@KatrinaNation @thenation @EricAlterman So your thesis is that #RonaldReagan committed genocide. Nice friends you have @TinaSmithMN and @amyklobuchar
@SpeakerPelosi is being #dogwalked. Very pretty, nice boots. Nice bark. https://t.co/jBr5FnxM7U
@NathanLerner @BarackObama legacy is killing cancer patients by stealing their treatment funds and killing babies. @amyklobuchar and @TinaSmithMN should be mighty proud.
@bimmerella Next time with national emergency powers. Or did you miss that bimbo?
@jables76 We trust @potus to whoop ass.
See what an idiot @SpeakerPelosi looks like? She's real PROUD to be a dishonest street urchin though. https://t.co/G2ZSLlbaca
@sfpelosi You go tell your mama, honey, that she better quit looking like a sad clown, because #itsnotovertilthewallisbuilt. Run along now.
@will19008 You're an ass, @RBReich because you think your lack of honor and patriotism is a big purple heart of something. You're always irrelevant.
@tedlieu @DavidBrodyCBN You're an irrelevant moron, Gomer. You think you're cool showing you can't be trusted on your word. You look real bad right now. You're not going to win in 2020 because the voters have 2020 vision right now. You are bringing the typical lack of poise and dignity you exemplify.
Trust Trump to whoop ass. @amyklobuchar https://t.co/qCJ5MNxbqd
@DavidJollyFL Nothing you do is serious.
@SenateDems You're a #fakeparty
@ChrisMurphyCT @brianschatz You can
@ChuckGrassley They will not
@LeaderHoyer You better learn now
@jmartNYT @tedcruz We have been warning YOU @jmartNYT and now #Election2020 is coming and more of your #fakenews is going to be wiped out. We don't NEED your drivel.
@Newsweek So @SenatorCollins believes fed employees are working paycheck to paycheck. Maybe she's wrong? Are you being honest on this, Susan?
@PhilipRucker @jdawsey1 @seungminkim #fakenews He did not capitulate.
@SeanTrende @ron_fournier I that is a very stupid analysis, Sean. You're not an honest man.
@NikitaKitty @amyklobuchar @Jason2CD @collinpeterson @SpeakerPelosi @790KFGO Again, go to @790KFGO. The strings were to make sure he could use the funds to build the wall. I am very detailed.
@theblaze I think it is the goofy hat that did him in.
@bpolitics @bpolitics already shifting the boundaries of the statement.
@MrChuckD @rolandsmartin What are the numbers on the West Indies?
@rolandsmartin I like it when Roland gets that real sneaky look like no one can see what he and the "grand jury" are up to.
@LarrySabato First, Larry. Learn what public service is. It's not what you think.
What is the test data. https://t.co/vCOZghhUV4
@NikitaKitty @amyklobuchar @Jason2CD @collinpeterson @SpeakerPelosi That is NOT what @collinpeterson suggested. Check the @790KFGO feed to find out what he DID say. Now's the time to be accurate. Don't act like a pompous Kirby Puckett prosecutor @amyklobuchar
@NYGovCuomo See Andrew Cuomo has the leverage to force @potus not to excerise the powers vested in him. Are you daft, Andrew? #ysos?
@keithboykin We're going to need a physical barrier, and much more. @realDonaldTrump are smarter than you Keith, give it up.
@JohnDingell Don't disgrace yourself John. Help finish this deal. People are not pleased.
@E_J_Piper @MnDPS_DPS I'm glad you're okay. Now think about the hundreds of Minnesota women whose #breastcancer treatment coverage you cancelled while operating the @MinnesotaDHS thoughtlessly.
@BreitbartNews Clapper's a lunatic.
@RepOHalleran says he's a Blue Dog. SINK @SpeakerPelosi if she keeps screwing around. Replace her. That's your leverage. @POTUS https://t.co/qAifuT7mnj
@TIMENOUT @realDonaldTrump Well, cutie litle @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi you think this is a #tinklecontest. @potus will use the powers vested in him. And you will go down, rejected by real @TheDemocrats
@NBCNews People like him can cross Mexican border. They can if not vetted come back into the country to carry out terrorist attacks, @amyklobuchar and @TinaSmithMN listen up.
@MPRnews Hey @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer stop your little GAME-playing to listen to this! @amyklobuchar
@HuffPostPol @SenSchumer needs to be removed from his position.
@justinamash Oh, so Justin is the "economist"?
@ChrisMurphyCT HEY @ChrisMurphyCT! YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE CONSTITUTION!!!
@SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Within THREE WEEKS Chuckie and Nancie. Negotiate in good faith or face the wrath of #election2018
@DavidAFrench Detail of David's "thinking" spill out in discussion with @ChuckRossDC. What meatheads like @RepAdamSchiff imply is that on behalf of Trump campaign Stone was to seek out Wikileaks and ask them to hack and spill more material of some illegal nature or by Russians. Okay? Straight?
This tweet by @SenKamalaHarris like the persecution of #KirbyPuckett by potential "candidate" @amyklobuchar should be a disqualifier. She is a little Stalinist type WISHING she could imprison her AMERICAN opponents. Dump her. #DogWalk her. https://t.co/pqqvysi383
@washingtonpost The ugliness pours out of this photo of @SpeakerPelosi. What a waste of a life in politics. From an "idealist" to a cynical conniving manipulator of hundreds of millions of people. @amyklobuchar
@MSNBC However angry you are @StenyHoyer I am more angry. Don't be a liar and betray your agreement or Americans will NOT forget. A lot of foreigners will like you though.
@MSNBC Lyin' already eh? Think you're tough. #ItsNotOverTilTheWallisBuilt!!
@SenatorDurbin If you build #theWall saphead you can EASILY avoid it. Else America needs to guaranteed you LOSE, sir.
@ChrisMurphyCT You really ARE sorry, Chris. And you too Ted.
@TeamPelosi It appears that @SpeakerPelosi is prepared to betray America's trust in this agreement and further ENDANGER Americans. @POTUS
@senatemajldr @POTUS Looks like the deal is to #FundTheWallNow with @HHSGov budget
@amyklobuchar You're in no position to thank anybody. #ItsNotOverTilTheWallisBuilt. I know that even though while seeking re-election you dishonestly said you supported #theWall with @BarackObama you will join #Resist until you are rendered a non-entity in Washington. #RememberKirbyPuckett
@SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Remove @SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer from leadership. They are ruining America and @TheDemocrats
@RepAdamSchiff See, already @RepAdamSchiff is lying and attacking the @potus. I'll never support you Adam. Take a walk. But remember #ItsNotOverTilTheWallisBuilt @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN
@DavidAFrench What crimes do you see alleged, David. If you can be specific while taking these positions.
@JohnJHarwood #ItsNotOverTillTheWallisBuilt
It appears to me someone is trying suppress this information, as if people should not be allowed to hear it. It's about saving women's lives from the government abusing their health coverage. You decide. https://t.co/ysaWQrl2N9
@thehill It's not ad-libbed, morons. You're laughing at Harriet Tubman. Bastids.
@PhillyInquirer Help the #Homeless
@KurtSchlichter Commies and outside agitators.
@SenKamalaHarris @rolandsmartin You better get some sense and #BuildTheDamnWallNow
@IlhanMN @rolandsmartin You do not belong in the @USHouseNews you're a mistake by @GovMarkDayton. @Ilhan
@brianefallon @rolandsmartin #BuildTheWallNow nitwit. It's not over until the Wall is built.
@EricHolder @rolandsmartin Stronger than you dude. You're the oppressor. You caused a bench warrant to be issued against me if I didn't pay up $12,000 for a supposed student loan amount, and you supporting the hiding of the documents which showed I was forced out with YOUR false case. Oppose @SpeakerPelosi
@tuohy So I look at your sexy little game. See @washingtonpost is like making fun of Harriet Tubman during previous slavery eras. You should ashamed. I never listen to your crp.
@tuohy So Dan. I'm going to look at your stuff. REMEMBER this is not a game. This is  human trafficking. Are you really going to trivialize sex slavery, dude? Because you think it makes YOU and your government #fakenews sexy? I'll look.
@rollcall Fine, it will be passed for THREE WEEKS read my lips. Three weeks. Or will #tinklebell @SpeakerPelosi refuse to open the government for three weeks? @LindseyGrahamSC okay.
@DineshDSouza @diana_west_ @realDonaldTrump It needs to be done.
@cam_joseph @chrislhayes @realDonaldTrump Expected #fakenews drivel from you, Cam. You're a big part of the problem. Nitwit.
@washingtonpost Yeah, only in the next three weeks we'll have a #SOTU2019 and a BIGGER #bullypulpit. This is why people like you can't lead.
@PrisonPlanet No, Paul, again, don't be stupid. Don't be #fakenews. He's in charge, because he can get it done. You CAN'T get it done, the base should support @potus getting done. Think over the details.
@guypbenson Don't be stupid. #ysos?
@joelpollak He did not and don't say he caved. Use your mind a little deeper. So it's three weeks to get a solution of funding. And after that the national emergency. This is a very smart way to do it. Think now and don't think there's some "base" that wants you to say we're caving. NO.
@Yamiche @NewsHour Very stupid question, because he is going to get the wall funding. DUH
@thehill I'm more angry @fbi chris wray at you and your anti-American, anti-Constitution petty tyrant sabotage of the Republic. Got that? You stop your coup attempts.
@jeffzeleny "Accepted the political reality" LOL. That's your slant from your bigoted #fakenews perspective.
@randpaul16 What court?
@ericmwalker You stop playin' right now. Because a lot of the REAL @MinnesotaDFL don't appreciate all suffering YOU are causing.
@thehill "Suggests"? "Lashess"? You're #FakeNews
@RepAdamSchiff Then it's wholly insignificant Adam. That just means he was interested in the releases, as you correctly say. All of America was. Because we know that you and @HillaryClinton were not in the best interests of America.
@DavidCornDC You're #fakenews Dave and will go the way of that. But what you attempt to portray as "communicate with WikiLeaks" may just mean, and does, that he wanted to monitor their releases. Nothing to do with Russians. You say "about the Russian hacks". BUT you're a well-known liar #kstp
@amyklobuchar What about Kirby Puckett, Amy? @SenAmyKlobuchar Bet you didn't think THAT would come back to haunt you, did you? If we could get a photo of you and Kirby, it would be the same as the @alfranken "sexy" photo.
@BostonGlobe Requires you to sign up. Don't do it you can go straight to youtube.
@ajc @CocaCola @SuperBowl I wonder how much that will cost them. But the moron @MarshawnLynch24 will no doubt be pissing on our flag again, and that's a bad look. Bad look for @nfl.
@Graniteprof Don't blame the godfather, @amyewalter you're just an idiot. A partisan hack pretending to be objective. #fakenews
@InezFeltscher @SebGorka No, I don't agree with that. They need to operate within the law. And the voters need to reform the @fbi to make clear they may not play little couo d'etat games against the Republic with a "president" like @BarackObama. The voters do need to show an interest in that for that.
@ForecasterEnten @Graniteprof LOL what an idiot. There hasn't even been a deal and you have it all worked how how hilarious.
@washingtonpost @PressSec is correct. @amyklobuchar Kirby Puckett persecutor. @TinaSmithMN @MinnesotaDFL
@mj_lee @maggieNYT @realDonaldTrump Which I'm sure in your twisted little #fakenews alternate reality makes him definitely guilty. Get some integrity.
@politico Piss off @fbi Chris Wray. Stop your coup d'etat.
@dandrezner This is where the going down in flames and infamy begins, Dan. Enjoy the ride.
@danpfeiffer Your brain has been neutered, Dan, by @BarackObama. You're now officially an #ObamaZombie
@ChelseaClinton Which means, Chelsea, that you put yourself in the position of supreme leader and knock aside the U.S. Constitution. Like @amyklobuchar likes to do, and did with Kirby Puckett, making an unconstitutional show trial against the famed baseball hero.
@BrandonJHurley @carrollspaper @SteveKingIA @realDonaldTrump @BlacKkKlansman Making the kids stupid.
@thehill Popcorn.
@dandrezner Your credentials as a "professor" have been revoked, Dan, by me. You're just a stooge.
@PrisonPlanet Get 'em out of there!
@FaceTheNation Dumbos like @amyklobuchar who tried to prosecute Kirby Puckett for "sexual assault" and "false imprisonment" at @HennepinAtty are now taking on people like John Corsi and @StoneColdRoger not to mention Papadopolous backfiring on them. Watch them go down in FLAMES.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @FBI Hey, Gomer @tedlieu how's the JAG business? What do you do, court-martial people? LOL.
@jimsciutto Good. FIRE them. @FBI
@SebGorka I am primarying @TinaSmithMN for @USSenate running part to #shutdownRobertMueller now. We need to walk back this practice and precedent of loser, "revolutionary" parties attacking the legitimacy of the government with hack lawyers and activist judges. @RudyGiuliani @POTUS
@daveweigel @scottwongDC Hey #FakeNews #YOUREFIRED!
@mitchellreports @PeteWilliamsNBC You #fakenews enemies of democracy are bringing this on yourselves, you will be sidelined by history as the #1stamendment marches on, on top of your head.
@NBCNews Ro-ger! Ro-ger! Ro-ger! @StoneColdRoger
@JohnJHarwood That's not a "key passage" John. That just means he would watch for future releases. You idiot. #RobertMueller is also an idiot to do this publicly and will be forever disgraced by any true AMERICAN. Which you should find out what one is.
@mtracey @PrisonPlanet I agree. #RobertMueller is a fraud. He'll go before the majority black DC "grand jury" like the DC blacks did to Nixon. And they'll agree with  whatever @TheDemocrats hack attorneys tell them the game plan is.
Well, this is what I advocated long ago. @amyklobuchar so your response? @TinaSmithMN? https://t.co/YIMSuIT2h8
@politico Thank you @business I'm sure they'll want you to run for @potus, take your best shot.
Yes these members of the @ussenate and @USHouseNews are corrupted to turn against their own nation's security. But @potus makes the decision, not corrupt pols like @SpeakerPelosi https://t.co/zBjGANCoqr
Yeah, #robertmueller @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN @MinnesotaDFL we comin' with #RonaldReagan. Get ready for #Election2020 and you can try to get another prosecutor after you LOSE that one too. https://t.co/Nfp8XpBmYh
@NYDailyNews @DLoesch doesn't discredit anybody. You're filthy liars. (Which is a fine distinction from a mere liar--means you roll in the filth of lies and like it.)
@davidfrum Go back to Canada and take you worthless @TheAtlantic with you. Or if you wish dump it in the Atlantic.
@amprog It's not a surprise only because the depths of your depravity is well-known
This I agree. I know @amyklobuchar is full of glee by this. She was REALLY gleeful when as @HennepinAtty she prosecuted Kirby Puckett for sexual assault and false imprisonment felonies. He would have been locked away for life. #massincarceration #dontVoteforAmy https://t.co/fY6EBny75Q
@thehill So to you you're saying #theWall can't be effective, right? Trying to keep the #shutdown going and win points for your @TheDemocrats against @potus? So @amyklobuchar is one of 535 experts on border security? LOLOL
@amyklobuchar Your prez race is over. Now you're destroying your @USSenate career.
@amyklobuchar Getting desperate as Kirby comes back to bite her in @StarTribune ....
@amyklobuchar Genius @amyklobuchar: Fed workers should not be living paycheck to paycheck DUH. Also they should have assets they can draw against if they are really barely surviving. The issue is getting the work done, not that they should be destitute.
@politico @amyklobuchar and @TinaSmithMN who were "elected" only because they are women in a country dominated by #genderquota voting laws excluding men, need to wake up. These quota laws MUST BE DISMANTLED. But if they think they benefit by playing with our govt they're sadly mistaken.
@BostonGlobe Adams the @Surgeon_General is absolutely correct on this.
@KurtSchlichter It's quite clear, as Ben Stein said, that if the #2ndAmendment is eliminated, people like @AOC , @Ilhan and @RashidaTlaib, and @SenWarren would indeed utilize the U.S. military, Maduro-like to walk all over the rights of all Americans and impose socialism. @TinaSmithMN
@scottwongDC @warriors @BarackObama Who knew? Professional athletes are racist and unpatriotic! Wow I'm so impressed. #JustDribble
@IanSams @PeterHamby "Piece". LOL. That used to mean something Peter. You know why? Because media was SERIOUS. You are #fakenews you are NOT serious. Not even worth a look. People get information from their computers. From databases hooked to their businesses. NOT from you, you narcissistic moron.
Here's a photo of the @SpeakerPelosi #shutdown. And her buddies (because you HAVE to "elect" women) @amyklobuchar and @TinaSmithMN https://t.co/YrIBaMEQcc
@TheDemocrats @TheDemocrats are a burden. @amyklobuchar is a burden. @alfranken is a burden. Kirby Puckett is not a burden.
@InteractiveMary Also listen, https://t.co/YFmNiOhiHu they [not the #CatholicCovington kids called "Gad" an "Uncle Tomahawk" and a "real [something]"
@InteractiveMary Have you watched? I bet you have not. https://t.co/YFmNiOhiHu This is what these young people heard hurled at them. "Gad" intervened. They were polite as he sang AIM anthem. Someone denounced at "loud ass women". Listen who it was.
Excellent! @potus https://t.co/AsUVCHNbbY
@DavidAFrench @guypbenson I have not heard the specific lie.
This kid is a NATIONAL HERO. @nicksandmann https://t.co/ifAahnLwfQ
@chicagotribune I'll need some forensic evidence.
@chicagotribune Probably B.S. Someone broke a window. This was not a "bomb". The director was apparently warned to stay away during his usual hours. So an "admission" doesn't seem credible. So what real information is there about this "group."
@KatiePhang Yeah. It's me. Its's the American voters. We're very triggered.
@ddale8 @chrislhayes I'll feel sorry when you lose your jobs because of bad reporting.
@deemallon89 JUST #BuildTheWall
@DadHasADD EXCELLENT, Mr. Trump. Don't play "publicity" games with our national security.
@joelpollak He probed the @fbi along with his bros as AG. Racial thing that hurt our national security.
This is correct, @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN vote to make a large downpayment with @LindseyGrahamSC then get in negotiations with @SpeakerPelosi to help her save face https://t.co/x3xMDMPExc
@michellemalkin @TeaPartyNevada @gatewaypundit @CassandraRules @cristinalaila1 @Cernovich I was the first to take it over.
@IAmAmnaNawaz @NewsHour YouAreWrong Amna Nawaz.
I urge all @SenateDems to go with @senatemajldr on this. https://t.co/BxKtC06qcO
@RepGregoryMeeks The operative phrase, Gregory, is "it's time to make a deal".
@nytimes @jbouie Bouie's cracked. He tries to cover it up with academic like prose
@rollcall Well, she might be because they can get #TheWall built and play nice. Maybe even be rational. @SpeakerPelosi
@dandrezner It does NOT work, Dan. That's a fraudulent statement.
@gatewaypundit @CassandraRules He's not a fraud. He is protesting for American Indians. As to his military record, well it is what it is, he wasn't protesting as a military hero. He wasn't the trouble, the other guys, "Israelites" were the problem. I didn't watch the entire @SavannahGuthrie interviews.
@joshscampbell @Acosta Any kind of lie to sell a book, heh?
@smontemayor @SenRonLatz @mnguncaucus Where is his showing that this would even help Minnesota? Specifically.
@ThisWeekABC @ABC No, @BarbaraComstock the voters are not playing games. We need to move forward on #TheWall that's what the voters decided. And it's needed to secure the border effectively.
@cspan @SenatorBennet @SenTedCruz I think that's pretty wrong, Senator Bennet. Go ahead and vote for it. Vote for @DHSgov too if there's an intelligence bi-partisan plan. And vote for #TheWall like the veteran @collinpeterson said it's going to be built, let's #buildthewallnow. @potus
@thehill I'm sure it will be a doozy LOL.
@JackPosobiec @gatewaypundit If they don't know how to do the job, they shouldn't be in the business. Start writing some straight news. That's where the long-term market is. Promote yourself through social media, don't hang around the dying #fakenews mainstream media. WHO is your market?
@amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN pay the Coast Guard. https://t.co/yxNMk5VO54
@winbensmoney @TheOldManClub You actually said voo-doo, not doo-doo. So are you really Ben Stein?
@ThisWeekABC @RepCummings is unacceptable. No leadership just kowtowing to loser attacks on #Election2016.
@rollcall So this idiot @SpeakerPelosi and @chuckschumer have as a goal to "beat Trump" by cancellling the #SOTU2019 and forcing the govt open with no #Wall. She MUST be removed. This is not a game.
@TerryMcAuliffe @LarrySabato @realDonaldTrump @UVA @Center4Politics Your promotion of hatred against the South for political gain and to pretend you and your buddies were providing "leadership" just because you face-painted the @WhiteHouse with black face has no place in America. It's not dialogue, it's not progress, it's malaise. Stop it.
@TerryMcAuliffe @LarrySabato @realDonaldTrump @UVA @Center4Politics Terry I am reading the hater's history of America, a terrible book "American Revolutions" by Alan Taylor who just came over to Virginia about the time these idiots started tearing down monuments. On the cover is a group of colonists tearing down George III statue. Don't do this
@thehill He doesn't sound very scienbtific.
@CillizzaCNN Chris thinks he's making history smh
@politico She's a goofball. She needs to be getting about a #Wall and stop trying to build a wall that's smarter than she is. @SpeakerPelosi
@MattGertz @dandrezner This is a good thing. I got laid off in the 90's. Just keep learning, be honest, pay more attention to the truth than you have to in the #fakenews. I was working to deal with the internet which interrupted plans to bring a new paper to the street.
@ggreenwald @KatrinaNation @RoKhanna @michaeldweiss This guy is a "member of Congress" and he begins his policy statements with "let me get this straight" like he's got a "comedy" talk show. This is what the @dnc has descended to with their little #genderquota and #racequota "voting." #WalterMondale your work.
@CillizzaCNN Not everybody lives paycheck to paycheck like you hack #fakenews journalists Chris.
@ZephyrTeachout @KatrinaNation @LaUnicaZeMendez City of Babylon. Thinking they're all so "beautiful" and narcissistic killing off human life. Like to think they can all sing and dance because they amp up the light show and sound effects. A dying city trying to drag down a civilization...
@wachfox And @alfranken calls out from the peanut gallery.
@davidaxelrod @StanMcChrystal Petraeus, that's the one. @BarackObama was a treacherous affirmative action choice who bumped @HillaryClinton off the womens' #genderquota entitlement track using your gender and race quotas, Axelrod. He was never a president.
@davidaxelrod @StanMcChrystal @BarackObama played at being president and used McChrystal, the other legendary dude too who was at @CIA to show #fakenews he could "govern". Well your PR isn't working with me, David. Why'd he fire this guy?
@davidaxelrod @StanMcChrystal Oh, yeah. The one your bro fired in the middle of a war for talking to @RollingStone. I guess a good PR firm like yours is going to make me forget? @BarackObama never knew--or cared--what the he was going to this nation.
@MSNBC @Morning_Joe @FBI remember YOU. DID. THIS. You like to play little games against the government. Yes, Kelly has joined the others to get funding for these items. But stop trying to reverse election results from #election2016. #RobertMueller.
@ProfSaunders @dandrezner @DenisonBe @monkeycageblog Sure Ben has the luxury of an academic discussion on this. But that's not good enough. I'm sure all of this data is in the policy making mix.
@rollcall "Guaranteee a vote" is NOT good enough. Don't play like this and pretend it's "Trump" that's shutting down the government. @amyklobuchar @TinaSmithMN
@davidfrum @sfchronicle The hip #Canadian view from Ottawa. And the San Francisco real cool hipster who grabs the mike pretending she's @SpeakerPelosi
@thehill Passengers can be very rude.
@mattyglesias @chrislhayes So you're saying @BarackObama made the prime age employment rate has bounced back?
@ThisWeekABC Ground control to Major Tom....
@DMRegister So Nathan said @nicksandmann should apologize to a lot of Indian people, he'd be "way down the list." Might be why he walked up to him. @SavannahGuthrie I don't think you're quite up to a dialogue like that. So we have these snippets.
@DMRegister Forgiveness. Looks like @SavannahGuthrie is getting the scoop. I would ask Nathan, did you know the "Israelites" call you "Gad" and say "Now that's a real---- right there?" Oh, and call the Indian people "Uncle Tomahawk"? Forgiveness. They say you "rescued" the 5 of them here
@LarrySabato @TerryMcAuliffe @Center4Politics @UVABatten You can do better than that, Larry. Get out of Virginia sometimes.
@bpolitics See @amyklobuchar THIS is what it looks like. Not #KirbyPuckett.
@SCPublicRadio Did you get that @MNSupremeCt? "Justice delayed is justice denied". That's what happens when the state cancels the #breastcancer treatment coverage of a woman in treatment, AND you say Goldberg notwithstanding, she doesn't get a dime until she wins her appeal. @TonyLourey
@WLTX Don't think so. You telling me we could fight war in the middle east with the national guard, but couldn't keep the planes flying? @potus @SpeakerPelosi
@ggreenwald @KatrinaNation Well, the solution to @BretStephensNYT statement is that sometimes you get to stand with the people, and we should be glad when that happens. The @POTUS is not omnipotent. You can't go around the world knocking off everyone you think is an oppressive dictator. Not happening here.
@rosenbergerlm @dandrezner Quiet, Dan. This is a matter for adults.
@AHMalcolm @HISTORY In partnership with the American Can Company (and the city dumps). With Gottfried Krueger, alright.
@CillizzaCNN They live paycheck to paycheck.
@TwitterMoments I understand this is a dishonest depiciton, @twitter, as the letter is directed to Congress as well, while most will read this as directed toward Trump.
"There are one million journalists in this naked city and they need a little faith too." "But what if they don't want it?" Who was in this famous colloquy? A. @realDonaldTrump B. Not Trump
Ain't it the truth. https://t.co/EgpcfuWMw6
@RealClearNews FIRST, talk about the #genderquotas in voting and caps on MEN before you talk about "women in @TheDemocrats." Because right now you're lying.
@markknoller @POTUS @DHSgov Okay my bad. I believed the depiction that this letter signed by John Kelly was directed at Trump. I said it should be to Congress, it was.
@gregorykorte Gregory Korte's sexist depction of Nancy Pelosi engaging in her latest #tinklecontest with Trump: "tit-for-tat".
@gregorykorte @USATODAY is loony if it thinks that @SpeakerPelosi and her demented chamber somehow represent the "norms and traditions" of the nation in hating the @potus.  You're not the #freepress either, you're just #fakenews. Jump back, and do your JOB. IF you're capable. @amyklobuchar #ap
So will @SpeakerPelosi be making a cameo appearance? https://t.co/ckhIJcuRgC
@WLTX Stop playing @amyklobuchar. You pretended to follow @collinpeterson on agriculture when you were campaign at @MNFarmfest. Now FOLLOW him. Vote for #TheWall and allow NAFTA 2.0 to go forward. You'll never be prez. Think about your state Minnesota.
@Newsweek @FoxNews sucks. #SocialMedia is MUCH better, what a waste.
@rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi So you admire this? She's an idiot, she needs to be getting #TheWall built. The "wall" she wants to fund is smarter than she is! Nancy Pelosi is pretty stupid if her wall is going to be smarter than her, dumb as a brick. Quit messing with national security, @SpeakerPelosi
@thehill Here's the reality, @SpeakerPelosi and you know it as well as I do: You are the product of unconstitutonal #genderquotas in voting for nomination of federal officials straight onto the general election ballots in EVERY STATE. You cap males, you EXCLUDE males. Give our party back!
Okay, @SpeakerPelosi you win your little #tinklecontest. This is on you, it's all over you. We're so impressed. Now what? You going to destroy the country because you're so "oppressed"? Impress us. https://t.co/h3Dc8e1Zx2
@USATODAY Get #tinklebell @SpeakerPelosi to be HONORABLE. Fund #TheWall yes a physical barrier. Do it now, do it soon. Or YOU, airlines are to blame just as you were on 9-11 when you knew the risk.
@Newsweek #fakenews
@thehill John Kelly, what you need to do is call on @JimClyburnSC and @StenyHoyer to give the funding for #TheWall. Listen to @collinpeterson. Don't play with our national security, general.
And why should the United States recognize the validity of this action, @amyklobuchar? This is what you are kowtowing to and trying to overthrow our OWN government, prosecutor. So tell me why? @SecPompeo https://t.co/vfjlAM9O5y
@SpeakerPelosi You are DISHONORABLE Nancy. And that is not a good thing. I know you think it makes you a superior person to lack honor. Listen to a leader from Minnesota @collinpeterson (not @amyklobuchar or @TinaSmithMN). Why not build it NOW? Don't lie.
@SpeakerPelosi Your "differences". I call you out for being a liar, Nancy. You're simply trying to manipulate the situation. You must LEAVE your @SpeakerPelosi position and let us secure our borders. You want OPEN BORDERS for political reasons. @Pontifex
@rcooley123 @padresteve @POTUS is better.
@kentesswel @SocialPowerOne1 @SpeakerPelosi @AOC @Ilhan She said a system that allows billionaires to exist is immoral.
@kentesswel @SocialPowerOne1 @SpeakerPelosi @AOC @Ilhan According to what I've seen that is false.
No! I didn't mean to say he can come HERE and speak! I'M the @SpeakerPelosi here! https://t.co/EjTcMJ9YoC
@FreeBeacon Wait til they find out @amyklobuchar prosecuted KIRBY PUCKETT for sexual assault and false imprisonment because he helped a woman use the men's room when there was a long line for the ladies' room. @SenAmyKlobuchar #Election2020. THAT's backpedalling!
@TheOldManClub I like the part where @winbensmoney says, cl-a-a-s, and when George Bush tried supply side theory is was what kind of economics, blank--doo. That's right, doo-doo economics. Bueller, Bueller...
@kentesswel @SocialPowerOne1 She said a society in which there are billionaires is immoral that's why. Clearly she thinks it is necessary to eliminate all the billionaires, right? Eliminate the walls like @SpeakerPelosi and eliminate the billionaires like @aoc, and then eliminate the tantrums (@Ilhan says).
@KJWadz @washingtonpost You're pretty clueless. Congress does lead the country....
Fine. @HouseDemocrats are still invited, but their @dnc is in TATTERS led by a witch. https://t.co/jBk57SVV0h
@WhipClyburn Those are not poll taxes @JimClyburnSC
@elizacollins1 @USATODAY @SpeakerPelosi is acting so stupid she can't really think that @potus is going to treat her like a grownup.
@washingtonpost Well did she ever prosecute Kirby Puckett for rape and false imprisonment? If not she's one up on @SenAmyKlobuchar @amyklobuchar
@thehill Now if we can just dumb the wall down a bit we're there @potus
@RonBrownstein @chrislhayes You don't realize how bigoted you are @RonBrownstein You're not enlightened as you imagine yourself.
@wis10 Boycotting. Have fun though.
@thehill Pretty dumb, Nancy sheesh @SpeakerPelosi
@HardballChris @MitchLandrieu Wow. Heavy, Chris.
@JDaniel_Davis @DailySignal @Melanie_Israel ABORT @PPact
@RealCandaceO @ANTHONYBLOGAN Sounds pretty good.
@NRO Well, @JimClyburnSC since they're a college, they probably have a smart wall. Or it would flunk out.
@NRO So they were immigrating into college? Or this college is on the border?
@ByronYork @thehill Uh, doesn't seem very "smart" to me @JimClyburnSC can you explain this to the #tinklebell champion daughter of mayors?
@theblaze Lucifer @andrewcuomo
@Jillhopkins "Professional office talk" LOL.
@Jillhopkins "Simple ass" doofus? She better rescind C-SPAN which is done every day. They can use it.
@kevincorke @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Nancy is kind of bitchy don't you think? And a little idiot.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Resolution is not necessary. They allow people on C-SPAN all the time. Is she even going to pretend to rescind THAT also?
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Exactly.
@cspan @SpeakerPelosi Seems like Nancy is kind of pushy or bossy.
@RepSwalwell Guess you're not talking about being prez any more.
@GOPLeader I strongly support you on this, @GOPLeader but not on persecuting @SteveKingIA
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Dear Ted you should allow the C-in-C to do his job, captain or whatever you are. You're coming off like Gomer Pyle.
@TwitterMoments So at this point, @collinpeterson and you have been there longer than I but I think a point of personal privilege or its equivalent might be in order, where you as member have rights as against a dictatorial @SpeakerPelosi to use chambers for this speech. I hope moderates assert
@NRO @jimgeraghty At the end of @amyklobuchar @b_btodd arranged, a federal court issued a bench warrant for my arrest if I didn't pay the $12,000 they claimed after hiding the records and altering them, false claim to U.S. govt. immediately. Wants to be prez yeah
@NRO @jimgeraghty Someone like @SenAmyKlobuchar who was elected solely because men were not allowed to vote, thinks because she's connected with #WalterMondale that she can violate anybody's civil rights. And be "prez". LOLOL. No one knows her, she's toast.
@NRO @jimgeraghty Yeah, big stuff @amyklobuchar had @b_btodd prosecute ME as #usattorney after his buddies at @UMNews where I met Amy steal my federal financial aid, and falsely claim to @usedgov that I'd left school and refused to begin payments on student loan 9 months later. They KNEW I hadn't
@NRO @jimgeraghty Oh there it is @amyklobuchar duh. Prosecuted Kirby Puckett. And lost. Hey, @SenAmyKlobuchar didn't you have any other real crimes to prosecute? How about the Gopher 12-man squad gang rape that your office silenced?
@pastormarkburns https://t.co/UMmpb55Rn9 #OneMinnesota
@chicagotribune If @JimClyburnSC meant "not a wall" then it is NO DEAL. VE-TO
@maddow He doesn't have to mess with @RepCummings on this. Answer is no. @potus
@thehill Okay, and this might be the announcement from @potus coming. No one ever wanted a dumb wall. But as @collinpeterson says they must provide the money that is earmarked for a wall. Sensing the #shutdown might be ending soon.
@Acosta @abbydphillip Yeah, Abby IS pretty dumb. I have a question, don't people get tired of your lousy reporting? Do you believe people actually READ this stuff?
There you go. @potus #sotu2019 https://t.co/Muj1pWMeTN
@SusanPage @SpeakerPelosi @usmayors Yeah, we know she's corrupt.
@AaronBlake Probably preparations for #sotu2019 with @DHSgov security.
@KimStrassel @CPAC @WSJopinion @TheDemocrats @DNC @MinnesotaDFL @CA_Dem @texasdemocrats @nydems @demsforillinois we MUST IMMEDIATELY #shutdown the #genderquotas and #racequotas that distort and eliminate the 19thAm and 15thAm #RightToVote! Overcome mindless #resistance!
@latimes She'll have to address that. I have addressed it: https://t.co/UMmpb55Rn9
@TeaPartyNevada @gatewaypundit Or, since @SpeakerPelosi is equal to the @POTUS as defined in the Constitution, maybe she could just give the #SOTU2019 herself?
@thehill Ok, so #nathanphillips "was singing the American Indian Movement song". Yes, I knew I'd heard that before. @MinnesotaDFL I think this is a good thing and would like @nicksandmann to be in a dialogue with him as to why he's always up on the Lincoln Memorial mall.
@thehill I wish @SavannahGuthrie would ask him what was that song he was singing? I think I've heard that before. #NathanPhillips
@anamariecox @dandrezner Bring @DHSgov they did a great job on the Super Bowl. Plus interagency. Not @JohnBrennan though I don't trust him.
@jaweedkaleem @latimes @kurtisalee Nothing wrong with entitlement.
@mitchellreports @kasie Put @DHSgov in charge of @uscapitol security for #SOTU2019
@NBCNews @mitchellreports So, coup today?
@RandPaul Today's internet is NOT different, @RandPaul. It's just like @MLS it's getting more real. More important than ever to protect #liberty and reject #fakenews
@thehill Whoops, I guess "prosecutor" @amyklobuchar is falling behind in the @dailykos "straw poll." @MinnesotaDFL
@politico @RepJeffries says @potus is NOT a racist. I agree, @realDonaldTrump is not, furthest thing from it.
@USATODAY Someone better investigate @SpeakerPelosi for this threat and she might want to step aside as speaker. Let's have a vote on location of #sotu, and give @DHSgov responsibility for security not DC police. Does she have information of a threat? @collinpeterson @BettyMcCollum04
@creynoldsnc You better listen to this Christina before you comment on it further. I'm just listening to again right now. Kids were listening to this when "Gad" a.k.a. Philip, intervened. https://t.co/YFmNiOhiHu
@WashTimes Any plan in there for veteran homelessness @GovTimWalz? Jobs, of course. Drug addiction?
@FrankLuntz So is it a wall? #shutdown Will @potus have, as @collinpeterson says, a lock to use $5.7 billion to build a wall? Don't give me all this Schwarzenegger stuff, is it a wall?
@TeaPartyNevada @gatewaypundit So how do you see them as "black supremacists"? Because they think of a time when there were no white people, only dark people? Just asking about your reasoning. So I guess @scotusreporter you are saying this is not in her official capacity or something so not protected? Precdnt?
@BostonGlobe Might as well: too wet to plow, can't dance, @SpeakerPelosi is busy with a #tinklecontest.
@chrislhayes Wouldn't they have to take a vote? Couldn't some @HouseGOP use the chambers for an event? A televised event? @potus
@SenSanders You misquoted Bernie. Come on now, be straight up.
@RepGregoryMeeks No, you should say "If it rhymes it must be fine."
