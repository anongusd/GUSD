In Fulton, the EV vote in the runoff broke for Barrow by about 20.5k.	It broke for him by 100k in November.
Fulton county reported its early vote, and it isn't nearly enough to erase Barrow's deficit.
We project that Republican Brad Raffensperger has won the #GASOS runoff election.
DeKalb came in big for Barrow...28k margin in early voting.	But it broke for him by a 107k margin during the November round. #GASOS

Race call: Mike Dunleavy wins the #AKGov Republican primary.
@bikesalsa He‚Äôs running as an Independent in November.
Begich wins his primary, Young wins his. Just waiting on R Gov and D US House but those two may be called quick if their leaders hold their current margins.
In the first Alaskan returns, R Gov going Dunleavy by a big margin, in US House D, it‚Äôs Galvin with the lead.

After analyzing the precinct-level data out of Hawaii, particularly in #HI01, Hanabusa's old seat, we have a projection for #HIGov Dem.		Incumbent Governor David Ige will win the primary, face off against Republican Andria Tupola in November.
We also project that Andria Tupola has won the #HIGov R primary.
We're at just under half of the election day precincts reporting in Hawaii, all counties accounted for. Both primaries in #HI01 have been called, along with #HI02 D...
More DDHQ race calls in Hawaii	#HI01 Democratic primary: Ed Case wins	#HI01 Republican primary: Cam Cavasso wins
We will also have results for every gubernatorial and federal primary Tuesday night in Vermont, Connecticut, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, as we near the end of a long and fascinating primary season.
In #HI01 the early returns look really strong for Case (D) and Cavasso (R).
In #HI02 the number of voters who left their ballot blank: 5727	voted for Alu Campagna: 6596
Projection: with an overwhelming victory in the early vote (which constitutes the majority of votes cast in Hawaii elections), incumbent Tulsi Gabbard wins the #HI02 primary.
First numbers dropped around 6:50pm local time. Not bad, Hawaii!
And we're live with results. With over 110k counted so far on the D side, Ige leads Hanabusa by just over 6%. https://t.co/JSyVFwfDzx

And Carolyn Bourdeaux the winner of the #GA07 D runoff, 	and with that, we'll see you all again next Thursday evening for the Tennessee primaries!
We project Lucy McBath the winner of the #GA06 D runoff https://t.co/Z2kvudRjfH
McBath is still enjoying a 700 vote lead, with Cobb and Fulton still left to report precincts https://t.co/Z2kvudRjfH #GA06
@will_sommer yeah that....yeah.
With nearly all of DeKalb in, and half of Fulton, McBath narrowly leads over Abel in #GA06, 9489-9233 with 121/207 pcts reporting. https://t.co/Z2kvudRjfH
McBath's growing as election day votes seem to be favoring her over Abel in all three counties #GA06 https://t.co/Z2kvudRjfH
Bourdeaux cut Kim's lead to just 44 votes in #GA07...but Gwinnett (Kim's better county) is what remains. https://t.co/Z2kvudRjfH
McBath now up by 31 votes #GA06 https://t.co/Z2kvudRjfH
And with more election day precincts in from #GA06, Abel's lead shrinks to just 229 votes over McBath https://t.co/Z2kvudRjfH
Abel's lead keeps growing in #GA06, now about 5% with all three counties reporting their early vote and DeKalb/Fulton with election day votes in too https://t.co/Z2kvudRjfH
Kemp now at 69%. Just a total shellacking of Cagle. #GAGov	https://t.co/Z2kvudRjfH

We are calling the #GAGov R runoff for Brian Kemp at 8:06pm.
Over 103k votes counted in #GAGov, and we are about to get our first samples out of Cobb. With what we've already seen in Gwinnett and DeKalb.. this is it for Cagle. if he isn't crushing it there, and getting swamped elsewhere, game over.
Initial precinct out of DeKalb for #GA06- Abel over McBath...	and on the R side...it voted for Kemp.
81k in, Kemp sporting a 25% margin now https://t.co/Z2kvudRjfH
In #GA07, Kim is up in the early vote (out of the Gwinnett portion)
And Gwinnett's early vote is in...and it went to Kemp. This is very close to done.
Cagle's only hope of a win tonight lies in Metro Atlanta, and the outskirts do not look promising for him. #GAGov
52.5k counted, Kemp's lead now almost 23% https://t.co/Z2kvudRjfH
22k in and Kemp's lead grows to a 15% margin https://t.co/Z2kvudRjfH #GAGov
Over 12k counted, Kemp's lead is holding in the early vote. The largest counties of course have yet to report but a good scattering already rolling in so far. https://t.co/Z2kvudRjfH

Still tight between Jeff Burum and Antonio Sabato Jr for the 2nd place battle in #CA26. Separated by &lt;200 votes right now.
No R top-two in CA-39	Kim (R) will face off against Cisneros (D). Gap has grown for Cisneros as numbers came in, Liberatore (R) will fall short.
And with that last update, Doyle leads Donnelly by 87 votes in #CA08 so even that one fizzles. Still a long count ahead.

The Republican, Debbie Lesko, has about a 5.8% lead over Hiral Tipirneni. Close, but with so few votes left to actually count, Tipirneni is going to need to win those by a sizable margin to overcome. #AZ08

*awakens*	Good morning everyone!	Looks like DuPage dropped in an update late last night, and with it, Sean Casten wins the crowded #IL06 primary.
Lipinski looks like he will hold on in #IL03.	With all precincts reporting in #IL10, Douglas Bennett leads Jeremy Wynes by 253 votes in the race to challenge incumbent Congressman Brad Schneider.	And in #IL06, Sean Casten is right behind Kelly Mazeski- he trails by 262 votes.
All suburban precincts are now in for #IL03, only Chicago remains. Dan Lipinski leads Marie Newman 45,615 to 44,016.
The best nights are election nights. https://t.co/9enqvcU50I
After these contests wrap up, we head north to Wisconsin for the State Supreme Court election on April 3rd, then to Arizona for the Congressional special election on April 24th.
And in #IL03 Lipinski is holding onto a narrow lead over Newman. Most of the few remaining precincts are in Chicago.
Close primaries we are still watching at this hour	#IL10 (R) - Bennett 8375 to Wynes 8096 with 4 pcts left	#IL06 (D) - Mazeski 12580 Casten 11899 with 103 pcts left (all in DuPage)
Ives falls short of ousting Rauner, but came really really close, with a strong performance in the Collar. Still watching #IL03 though Lipinski is looking likely.
Will County is 4212-2975 for Newman per their reporting page.	With that, Lipinski leads overall, 40715 to 39306 in #IL03. Waiting on 2 pcts in DuPage, and 68 in Cook.
On #IL03	Only 1 precinct left in Will. Newman winning it 4112 to Lipinski's 2871
Rauner edging Ives in McHenry County, first results rolling in.
There are four election authorities across #IL03 (Sub Cook Chi Will DuPage)	Lipinski leads only in Chicago, but it may be enough to overcome the remainder of will and Suburban Cook.
Looks like there are more precincts left in Chicago than Suburban Cook in #IL03	about two dozen left in Will and 2 in DuPage.
So its Pritzker vs (Rauner/Ives)	and Lipinski is neck and neck with Newman with a good chunk of Will still out

When the Democrats botched #CA31 in 2012, four ran in the primary. When they nearly botched it in 2014, four ran again. There are SIX Democrats running in #CA39. https://t.co/mz5soDhvdp
@Daroff #CA31.	Aguilar, the current Congressman, missed his shot in 2012 by almost 1400 votes.	Leslie Gooch (R) fell 210 votes shy of blocking Aguilar for a second time in 2014.
@mrpaweska Yes, very much so, because it's already happened here.
The snafu almost repeated itself in 2014, so it's hardly an out-there scenario.
This happened as recently as 2012, in our founder's home Congressional district. Too many Democrats ran in what should have been a Democratic seat, and both primary spots were grabbed by Republicans.
On the other hand, so many Democrats are running in #CA39 that if the Republicans run just two candidates in the primary, they could theoretically snag both spots in June.
Republicans hoping to see the seat stay red would have preferred Royce run for another term. District had considerable ticket splitting in 2016. #CA39 https://t.co/secpatPm2L

@beardedcrank @deanbarker @DKElections Very much so. He won Bow handily, swept Manchester, lost Candia by a slimmer margin than previous D candidates.
With Dunbarton &amp; Hooksett still out, margin will likely drop, so wait until all precincts have reported before drawing '14,'16 comparisons.
@TPain151 2%
Only 529 ballots cast in Dunbarton today, 1800 in Hooksett, the 2 outstanding precincts. Boutin would need a ridiculous margin to overcome.
Kevin Cavanaugh has beaten David Boutin in NH #SD16, retaining the seat for the Democrats. With 2 precincts out, leads 58.3%-40.6%
They are still counting in Hooksett, but with only 1800 votes cast, Boutin needs a monstrous win there which he just isn't going to get.
All of Manchester has reported, Manch 12 goes to Cavanaugh 445 to Boutin 336 #SD16 https://t.co/xMyJnL3z4L
We are waiting on Manchester 12, Dunbarton, and Hooksett #SD16 https://t.co/xMyJnL3z4L
Reminder: a win for Democrat Cavanaugh would be a hold for #SD16, not a pickup. NH State Senate would then be 14 R 10 D
Boutin needs a huge win out of Hooksett to have any shot at winning #SD16 tonight.
Cavanaugh is on his way to winning #SD16 rather easily...	In Manchester 1, beat Boutin 1188 to 707, in 2, 771 to 441 https://t.co/xMyJnL3z4L
Cavanaugh wins Bow big- 938 to 626.	That makes 2/7 reporting for #SD16 https://t.co/xMyJnL3z4L
That's 1 out of 7 precincts reporting for #SD16 https://t.co/xMyJnL3z4L
Candia is in- Boutin 426 Cavanaugh 307 Dubrow 14 #SD16 https://t.co/xMyJnL3z4L

In SC-05, still nothing from Cherokee, or the swing-ish Chester County, but the margin is still very close, with Parnell down 2%.
In SC-05, Norman's margin is very close, with 62% in he only leads by 3%. However, much of very red Cherokee County is out.

Handel continues to climb as votes continue to come in and is currently ahead again.
Ossoff is improving around John's Creek, a city in northeastern Fulton County which exactly mirrored his overall share last time.
First results from DeKalb gives Ossoff a narrow lead. Ossoff currently has 50.3% over Handel's 49.7%Ossoff won early vote there by 20 pts.
But Ossoff's big edge in DeKalb blunted by Handel early vote lead in Fulton and Cobb
Ossoff won the early vote in DeKalb by 20%
For results from tonight's GA-06 and SC-05 races check our website or stay tuned here: https://t.co/rIWtLzR6C4

Per Hudson: Machine-reading error on 1 "personal electronic ballot". Re-ran with a different machine, correct # are 2530-2278 Norman #SC05
Not enough to change the outcome, of course, but good to follow up.
We've changed tally to match SOS until she calls back. Difference between reported last night/now would shift margin by 13 votes (to Pope)
Electronic review will be conducted for all counties anyway tomorrow, but LC director Mary Ann Hudson is going through "totals tapes" now.
On phone with Lancaster County SC- had a different total count there (with vol on site collecting) than reported on state system #SC05
Oh NOW you all care about #MTAL, huh?	No problem: we'll have returns next Thursday night!
Also, the general election is in five weeks. Pope could try to bind up Norman, but would risk being blamed if Parnell won from such a schism
RT @JMilesColeman: Everything in for the #SC05 R runoff. Ralph Norman (green) beats Tommy Pope (red) by just over half a point. https://t.c‚Ä¶
For those nerding out over the recount of a runoff: its an electronic review, not a by-hand, examine-sheets-with-a-magnifying-glass affair.

"breaking" news 90 minutes late. https://t.co/rRqbCIfFgN
Most of your stations will finally call this, now that the count is all but finished. Tally ends with Stothert winning 51,413 to 44,977
Mello FINALLY leads in a batch of votes...but its just the last section, and he only edged Stothert 12390 to 11400. https://t.co/CEQ9UrbQqy
Stothert's share of each vote chunk so far:	morning-early afternoon: 57.2%	early voting: 51.56%	afternoon-evening round 1: 55.5%
Votes updated for #omahamayor with first round of evening votes- Stothert's margin grows to over 7400 https://t.co/CEQ9UrbQqy
Another update of #omahamayor coming in about 9 minutes https://t.co/CEQ9UrbQqy
Stothert's lead will probably shrink tonight, but if Mello couldn't even win the early vote, he's not making up for it in evening returns.
We project that Jean Stothert has won re-election as #OmahaMayor https://t.co/CEQ9UrbQqy
Despite over 8% more registered Ds than Rs voting early in #omahamayor, Stothert carried it. #omahamayor https://t.co/CEQ9UrbQqy
With the early vote in, it was a lot closer, but Stothert carried it too, leads Mello by 5323 votes. #omahamayor https://t.co/CEQ9UrbQqy
Stothert WON the early vote in #OmahaMayor	https://t.co/CEQ9UrbQqy
Expecting the early vote to roll in about 12 minutes for #omahamayor. This will be critical for Mello. https://t.co/CEQ9UrbQqy
Reviewed some previous elections, upping our estimated total for #omahamayor to ~70k, more than first round. So &lt;50% expected total in.
I mean, since y'all asked about it.

@Izengabe_ @varadmehta @super_mario_21 @EsotericCD @RRHElections It's going to storm apparently
@armandodkos @kkondik Ex: in 2008, dramatic change in demo in Georgia during the Senatorial runoff.
@armandodkos @kkondik LVs were for this round. For runoff, way too many unknowns on LV for that, especially a theoretical one in the summer.
