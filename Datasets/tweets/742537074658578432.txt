@txteacher17 @NumbersUSA Who do you think harvests your food that is grown in the US?  Do you have anyone you would like to refer for work?  Would you like to clean hotel rooms or would you prepare illegals are hired.
@txteacher17 @NumbersUSA Then refer US workers and stop hiring illegals - these are housekeeping, landscaping, dishwasher and outdoor entertainment attendants.
@CCRJSamson @DouglasConley13 @NumbersUSA Non immigrant visas / non is the key word.  They work and go home and then return the following year.  Totally falsehood to state otherwise. It is NOT SUBSIDIZED BY TAXPAYERS!
@CCRJSamson @DouglasConley13 @NumbersUSA Alert - H2b is a guest worker program.  Non immigrant.  What part of that is misunderstood?  Do your research before you display your ignorance.

@mr_e_guy @ChadWhorton @H2VisaConsult @archwaylawncare @kevbrog @DouglasConley13 @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump @USDOL Ignorant perhaps. no, definitely when it comes to H2b process!  Dumb as a box or rocks? Not hardly. 	TBD -
@mr_e_guy @ChadWhorton @H2VisaConsult @archwaylawncare @kevbrog @DouglasConley13 @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump @USDOL What part of referring workers have you missed?  It’s the only way to help, but since you morally don’t agree, should we question your values?
@mr_e_guy @H2VisaConsult @archwaylawncare @ChadWhorton @kevbrog @DouglasConley13 @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump @USDOL You don’t have to look far dude - it’s people’s businesses.  If you do not have workers you can’t do the work.  Most people get that right out the gate.

@mr_e_guy @H2VisaConsult @archwaylawncare @ChadWhorton @kevbrog @DouglasConley13 @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump @USDOL My guess is you just like so many others, prefer to display their lack of knowledge in a hurtful way - stop crying/whinning than trying to be helpful.  Instead, especially in your case, when a woman educates you, your feelings get hurt.  Go enjoy retirement.  My very first words https://t.co/NgcyxbhvEt

You can make lots of money, and we all will educate you so you are no longer ignorant (in a nice way of saying) to H2b process and hiring American’s first.

@mr_e_guy @H2VisaConsult @archwaylawncare @ChadWhorton @kevbrog @DouglasConley13 @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump @USDOL Ken, the H2b community is one that supports each other.  We help during crises and stick together.  No one wants any help from you other than providing referrals.  If you don’t have any, perfectly ok.  We understand.
@mr_e_guy @H2VisaConsult @archwaylawncare @ChadWhorton @kevbrog @DouglasConley13 @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump @USDOL I’m ignorant to lots of things, so I don’t jump n 2 something I know nothing about with a flippant attitude by telling people 2 stop whinning &amp; crying when there is a crises that I know zip about. I bet u learned a lot today about something you didn’t have any real interest in.
@mr_e_guy @H2VisaConsult @archwaylawncare @ChadWhorton @kevbrog @DouglasConley13 @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump @USDOL The way you can help is - 1) research H2b (will take about 30 min), 2) refer workers.  It will be a win win.  We hire brilliant people in our company and we are incredibly blessed
@ChadWhorton @mr_e_guy @kevbrog @DouglasConley13 @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump Amen
@mr_e_guy We stand against hiring illegals.  We choose to do it the legal way but only after labor certification is provided by DOL.
@mr_e_guy Save their business, their home and provide for their children.
@mr_e_guy Educate yourself before you spout off hurtful remarks - stop whinning and the crying one.  These employers are facing losing their businesses or canceling contracts in the best economic environment.  One lady on the thread, her husband is in a wheel chair and she is trying to
@mr_e_guy When you are at 4 percent unemployment most everyone agrees that’s full employment.  Some of these areas it’s 2 percent.  The question is - if there are 7 million jobs (full time) why would there be a market for ft seasonal
@mr_e_guy They are seasonal and DOL, DHS, DOS oversight is unreal.
@mr_e_guy Don’t tell people to stop whinning when they are looking at losing their businesses - it’s very expensive to hire a foreign national.  Nobody in their right mind would hire a foreign national if they had an American worker available. The jobs are not glamorous -
@mr_e_guy Explained we hired Americans - you don’t know one thing about H2b - if you did, you would have never started the conversation.  It’s ignorance to the program that threatens peoples lives.  Good people hiring the legal way.  They do not hire illegals.  Honest and good people. https://t.co/sgbBCT8ZpD

@mr_e_guy @ChadWhorton @kevbrog @DouglasConley13 @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump Well thank you!  Remember to refer workers and that these are not year round jobs.
@mr_e_guy @kevbrog @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump You called yourself an idiot and that was true.  You tweeted that we should be hiring Americans First!  Duh!  We do and had you bothered to see what H2b was you would not have presented yourself as being ignorant.  Even when we have tried to educate you, and make it profitable
@mr_e_guy @kevbrog @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump No body attacked you.
@mr_e_guy @kevbrog @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump The H2b visa requires under federal law that you are America First!  We were America First before it was a political slogan.  If u had bothered to do a simple google search you would have known this from the get go.
@mr_e_guy @kevbrog @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump Look at the list - that will answer your questions.  Did you find it
@mr_e_guy @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump Thank you!  Looking forward to employing all your referrals.  There are over 100k jobs that start 4/1

@mr_e_guy @kevbrog @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump You might want to seriously educate yourself. I’m happy 2 refer you to websites. Btw, not all construction jobs r year round.  You can’t pour concrete when it is freezing! You don’t cut grass when there is snow on the ground, &amp; you don’t need carnival attendants after show closes

@mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump My tone - I’ve tried to answer every question you have posed and offered you a job.   I’m looking for solutions.  Have you found the list of jobs yet?  You keep asking about wages etc.  it’s all on that list.
@mr_e_guy @kevbrog @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump Great - learning is a great thing
@kevbrog @mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump Thanks Kevin.  Maybe you can help answer his questions.  If you find the list and want to refer, we will make it profitable for you.  At least you are learning something today.
@mr_e_guy @kevbrog @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump I’m not apologizing - I’ve tried to educate you but all you want to do is argue.  Did you find the job listings?  Happy to go over the list.  The post had all the terms.  Jobs vary from state to state and wages are at level 3 - pwd.
@mr_e_guy @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump I just took a quote from your own page!  Thought you believed in it.
@mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump Refer us people - jobs in more than 40 States.  When you have 7 million ft jobs maybe they rather have those than ft temp or seasonal.  This was published just last week https://t.co/JPiDT59WpF
@mr_e_guy @daniellelbane @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump It’s a person who wants to do the job.  Landscaping, dishwashing, steward, server, housekeeper, busses, cook - 8-9 months - wages are set by DOL - Level 3 pwd.
@mr_e_guy @daniellelbane @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump The list provides a full description of the duties and terms and conditions of the jobs.  Location, start dates. Employers pay all the fees associated with the recruitment.
@mr_e_guy @daniellelbane @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump Not volatile - go back and look at your first tweet.  Did you find the list of jobs yet?
@mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump No one here called you an idiot.  You are ignorant in this situation.  Your first tweet was offensive and suggested hire Americans first.  We do! Only visa program that requires it and employers attest under perjury. Next time research just a little.
@mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump No body is lying - that’s the point!
@mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump And I stand by #1.
@mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump Your words - my answer #1	1. It could be that I don't know what I am talking about (3+ % unemployment in the US but you cannot fill these jobs with Americans, WHY?)	2. You don't know what you are talking about (doubt that)	3.

@mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump About the situation.  I don’t want you working 4 me unless u can solve a problem.  Provided you with ample info to educate you.  Lesson learned - don’t jump into a fire unless you know where it is and if you know how to put it out.
@mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump I run into smart people like you all day who just want to argue and not solve problems.

@mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump You are ignorant in this situation.  You don’t know one thing about the certification process.  I’m happy to educate you though.
@mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump What’s your deal - you said somebody is lying and it wasn’t you.  No ego here / we hired you.  I’m hoping you can solve the problem.  You can start sending referrals any time.  Let me know if you can’t find the job postings on the DOL website.
@mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump You should be happy - you just got offered a job to solve a major problem for over 5000 employers.  Looking forward to implementing your solutions.
@mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump I’ll pay you to prove us wrong!  Find us US workers and you can be profitable.  If US DOL has already certified after exhausting all avenues then if you can, you will be the hero.
@mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump Apologize for what?  You called us liars.  Look up the jobs on the website and start referring.  There were over 100k listed on 1/7/19 starting at 2:00 pm est
@mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump Ask Trump why he uses the program too!
@mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump Then make some money off of the deal.  Start referring.  We would love not to hire foreign nationals.
@mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump Douglas and are are friends and we agree - ignorance is the key.  Lots of people like to spout off when they are clueless.  If you have referrals send them.  Jobs are listed on the DOL website.  Happy to send them to u too.
@mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump How the heck do we know why.  Maybe they don’t want a unskilled temp job when they have 7 million other jobs and don’t want them.  We have peoples lives who are on the brink if they can’t get wrkrs.  They lose their businesses.
@mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump I tell you what - every person you refer we will hire and will pay you a referral fee.  No one in their right mind would involved 3 fed agencies into their business if they had sufficient US workers
@mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump Because 1 you don’t know what you are talking about.
@mr_e_guy @DouglasConley13 @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump You can’t make people work.  By all matrix at 3 percent unemployment you are at full employment.  Some people just don’t want to work.

@JohnSherrel If a college graduate is competing for a dishwasher or housekeeping job in this labor market I would demand a refund from that college.  H1b is the high tech visa.  Do your research before you display your ignorance for the world to see!
@mr_e_guy @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump I’ll use one of your post - A post on Twitter is not an invitation for idiots to spout off at the mouth about something they clearly don’t know zip about. H2b requires 90 day recruitment every State/territory and a labor certification - unskilled jobs - housekeepers &amp;landscapers
@JohnSherrel H2b is a seasonal unskilled visa category.  No American has been replaced in a housekeeping or dishwashing job.
@JohnSherrel It’s clear that you are speaking from the position of being totally ignorant about what an H2b visa is!  A two second google search would have told you that high tech is not H2b but h1b.  Next time don’t show your ignorance.  It doesn’t look good on most people!
@JohnSherrel John - H2b is not the high tech.  That is h1b.  H2b is housekeepers, dishwashers, landscapers for seasonal/peakload jobs.  I know, there are lots of people who are ignorant to the specifics of all the visa programs.
@mr_e_guy @ChadWhorton @SecNielsen @SecretaryAcosta @realDonaldTrump We do but when you can’t find enough, you need a legal way to do it.  Research the H2b program and u will c it’s the only visa program that is American’s first https://t.co/ooi4aLn7VQ

@GroundsPro1 @ActionLori @SEA_labor @VTStrick I understand.  Do what you must but my energy is going into getting the max number of visas for those who are committed to a legal workforce.  Nothing has changed in 30 years with that purpose/mission.  All the best.
@GroundsPro1 @ActionLori @SEA_labor @VTStrick I’ve taken DOL to court.  Your win provides you with no tangible remedy (not in this case).  Be prepared to spend millions.  I do not know any attorney that will take the case that knows anything about H2b.  It’s not like you get financial rewards
@GroundsPro1 @ActionLori @SEA_labor @VTStrick Who is your agent?
@GroundsPro1 @ActionLori @SEA_labor @VTStrick Lawyers have been approached and no one will take it.  DOL said it was a random error and not criminal.  3-5 years in court - millions and relief would be obsolete
@GroundsPro1 @ActionLori @SEA_labor @VTStrick You have no legal case.  Even if you did, it would not provide you with any more visas.  That is Congressionally mandated.  PES has invested more than $100k this year.  Getting anything in a bill is hard work.  The best you could get is a OIG report for DOL delays
