Talk about #MustSeeTV these Democrat-Chaired Hearings in the house are electrifying. Trump is trying to con his way out of this bc he's finding out that the president, with all his power, can't check the role of congress. He can't fire them, can't primary them, can't beat them.

@realDonaldTrump has been president for 2+ yrs and has never once held an open town hall where he'd face voters of all parties and their questions. NOT ONCE! Instead, he holds "rallies" for his 35% hard core base who are not allowed to ask one question, just chant and applaud.
It's 2019. In 2016 Trump told America he couldn't or wouldn't disclose his tax returns because "he was being audited" and we let it slide. You think the @IRS is so dumb they still haven't finished 2+ yrs later? More BS from President Bullshit @realDonaldTrump right? #MarALardass

@MichaelWayne007 @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @HurdOnTheHill GOP controlled congress for 2 years &amp; ignored Trumps fascination with the "wall". The southern border is being fortified to keep brown asylum-seeking people out. Income inequality is trumps Achilles Heel. The economy is good, but many people have 2 jobs to make ends meet. Why?
@MichaelWayne007 @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @HurdOnTheHill What kind of walls do Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Austria, Sweden, Norway and Portugal have... and how about Canada? Israel is in a constant state of war readiness with hostiles lobbing rockets over the border. Poor example Mikey.

@Lord_Archrr @davidhogg111 Not meant to kill innocents.
@Lord_Archrr I don‚Äôt want to take guns away from people who respect them.  Good people should be able to enjoy their guns, but I‚Äôd like to see fewer bad people get easy access to guns. Hey, I respect your opinions but we have to agree to disagree. Take care.
@Lord_Archrr @davidhogg111 Seriously? 250 years and it‚Äôs still never happened. Government can track you with your phone, knows your financial status, SS, mortgage, car reg, boat reg, licenses, and you‚Äôre worried about registering a gun? I got rid of mine when we had kids, bc they are meant to kill.
@Lord_Archrr New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New York all have tough gun laws, plenty of hunters &amp; guns too. Very low crime rates. You missed the point, Indiana/Kentucky have loose gun laws higher crime per capita than bordering Illinois.
@Lord_Archrr Archie... It just isn't that easy. Everybody knows guns are brought into Illinois/Chicago by straw men who buy in states where the rules are lax, its not Chicago's gun laws that are lax. NYC is surrounded by states with tough gun laws and its nothing like Chicago. Change the laws
@Lord_Archrr Tell it to the parents and families in Newtown, Vegas, Orlando, etc..  Go talk to @davidhogg111 and the other survivors in Parkland. Its like saying the ocean only rose 2" in the past decade. Its not good. Why are people so afraid of registering a gun? Nobody's taking them away.
@Lord_Archrr I stand corrected, it was a 2018 https://t.co/kbmqZC5vqi article citing 2016 deaths.  The numbers are correct. Bottom line? Its crazy.  https://t.co/cazSvHU7dT
Agreed, but maybe I'd rather have a bit of a choke point with 10X the inspection (people/tech/dogs) than adding fifty lanes and not matching that with 10X the people/tech/dogs. Trump just won't admit where the bulk drugs are coming thru. https://t.co/BkdYfchTAg
@Lord_Archrr So the 1500+ different kinds of hand guns and long guns that are available aren't enough for the American consumer?  And just think... idiot Trump signed legislation allowing mentally impaired to buy all of those 1500+ weapons.
@Lord_Archrr According to CDC, with 37,200 (2018) gun deaths in America 64% (23,808) of deaths were determined to be homicides, 27% (10,044) were suicides, 9 percent were accidental shootings. We Lost in wars in Korea, in Vietnam, in Afghanistan, in Iraq...but lets not live in the past.
You want to say that 33,000 gun deaths a year is ok? Name one civilized western democracy where the per capita gun death ratio is anywhere near ours. Or one where mass shootings happen almost daily. Or one where citizens can buy as many firearms/ammo as they please, even crazies. https://t.co/VhE390I8MR

@SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer need to be as ruthless as McConnell was, and declare that their objective is to ensure that Trump is a one-term president, obstructing HIM on every expenditure, from taxpayer-paid golf trips to rally's, to examining his tax returns to appointments.
McConnell alone is the primary reason @SpeakerPelosi and @SenSchumer must turn just as ruthless as he was and refuse to budge on Trumps stupid wall. https://t.co/7Xoo2nAMBl
@SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @HouseDemocrats @SenateGOP  Just a word from those of us out here who voted for you and gave you a mandate to be the congressional check on this president. Don‚Äôt give in an inch be Trump will use this ruthless tactic just like McConnell did on Garland.
@Tiburcio_76 And what about Trey Gowdy admitting there's nothing there after a 2 year investigation? It's been proven Hillary's server was never hacked but DOD was, and NSA said Trumps unprotected iPhone was accessed by the Chinese.

What should @realDonaldTrump focus his limited attention span on?
@PressSec @PatVPeters Why worry about a handful of incident when 33,000 American citizens die every year bc congress and this president are on the NRA's payroll told to ignore those facts. Show us 10,000 border-related illegal alien murders and then citizens will support better border security.

@Morning_Joe Trump is so poor at communicating that in his speech to the troops he referred to our military missions being ‚Äúsuckers‚Äù? Would he like to explain that to the parents and families of those that died fighting in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan &amp;  Syria? Insults vets.
@MojoWinston @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse If that‚Äôs true, why hasn‚Äôt trump commandeered it? Sounds too good to be true, but trump is famous for using other people‚Äôs money to make himself look good. Like collecting donations for veterans and never paying it out.

He‚Äôs essentially telling all the veterans who volunteered for our armed forces that they were suckers. And how about the thousands that have died in combat? Are they suckers too? And the half million wounded... more suckers? Trump is dumber than he looks. Shame on him, apologize! https://t.co/6Xl5Ko4tfk
Memo to @realDonaldTrump in the @WhiteHouse When will you get the $5 BILLION from Mexico to pay for the wall startup? You PROMISED MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR THE WALL! Were you lying again? Did you make a DEAL with Mexico to pay for the wall or is it more Trump bullshit?
Maybe it‚Äôs just me, but I think when the President visits combat One troops he doesn‚Äôt refer to the current/past efforts and troops alive, wounded, and dead as being ‚Äúsuckers‚Äù. Does he realize we have a volunteer army for the past 40+ years? As a veteran I‚Äôm insulted. Just me?
@MojoWinston @realDonaldTrump Shamed into visiting troops in combat zones after 2 years of cowering. Obama and Hillary did it as senators and as candidates, Obama went every Christmas, so did GWBush IIRC. It's an unwritten obligation for a president. And then trump crys about the Wall? Yuck!
Agree 110%. Biden-Harris appeals to everyone, they get the seniors, the blue collars, the rust belts, the MeToo's, the Millennials, the east-west coast. Joe does one term, schools Kamala, she wins it in 2024 with Beto or Kennedy as VP. Biden has 20 point lead in polls. https://t.co/nrKYqIbJN4
