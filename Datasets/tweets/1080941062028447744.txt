#ICYMI Friday, I stood with local leaders to discuss the life-saving gun reform we passed in the House. It's time we address local gun violence with action. I will keep working on @HouseJudiciary to come up with commonsense solutions to make our community safer. #HonorWithAction https://t.co/UJ1AjQw8Il

In the district I…	- Stood with local leaders to honor those we’ve lost to gun violence, and the lives we will save when the bills we passed this week become law.	- Met with local leaders and city staffers in Homestead to discuss community development. https://t.co/QW09dcQphV
- Met with Citizens Trade Campaign (CTC), a national coalition of labor, consumer, environmental, faith, family farm, and other civil society groups with field staff across the country to discuss the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement.

- Voted YES to protect public lands like the Everglades and our beautiful state parks.
- Voted YES to close the Charleston Loophole. Under current law, if your background check takes more than 3 days, you’re automatically approved to purchase your firearm. If you haven’t completed a background check, you shouldn’t be able to purchase a firearm. Period. https://t.co/1jkvoiMD0f

In Congress I…	- Introduced a bill to prohibit voters being taken off voter rolls just because someone’s mail is undeliverable. https://t.co/cHtpfQmjTW
This week, we voted for sorely-needed change. For the first time in decades, we voted for commonsense gun reform and to protect our public lands, including the Everglades. Read more about what I did this week in my #weeklywrapup:

Voter caging prevents citizens from voting through no fault of their own. My bill would prohibit the use of voter caging mail to disqualify voters in a federal election. This dishonest practice is an attempt to suppress democracy. It must be stopped. #ForThePeople https://t.co/JIurkprzpU

Let's do everything we can to make our communities safer for everyone and #EndGunViolence		#HR1112 #CharlestonLoophole
FBI analysis of the current background check system shows that 3 business days isn't enough time to decide if someone shouldn’t be allowed to own a gun. #HR1112 gives them the time they need to conduct a thorough investigation.
In 2017, 6,004 background checks were denied after the initial 3-day waiting period.  #HR1112 would allow the FBI more time to run background checks so we can stop prohibited gun owners from slipping through the cracks.
The #CharlestonLoophole allows someone to purchase a firearm even if their background check has not been completed within the 3-day period.  This is dangerous and allows people with criminal backgrounds and mental illnesses to become gun owners.	https://t.co/rB3boukXPw
Americans overwhelmingly support background checks. Yet the #CharlestonLoophole allows someone to buy a firearm even if the background check hasn't been completed. 		I believe a gun sale shouldn't be made if the background check hasn't been completed. 		Period.		#HR1112 https://t.co/aMYnQib3N4

I recognize that the agreement failed to significantly reduce the number of ICE detention beds. However, I am pleased that this deal does not provide a single penny to additional ICE enforcement and removal, nor does it provide funding for President Trump’s wasteful wall.

A year ago, I met with the parents of the students who lost their lives at Parkland. All I wanted to do was find a way to take away their pain, but I couldn’t. So I made a promise that I would not stop until we changed our country's gun laws. #MSDstrong #NeverAgain https://t.co/HqMrZdlzys
#SinceParkland, the advocacy of MSD survivors has:	✅ Increased FL voter registration by 41%	✅ Banned bump stocks nationwide	✅ Raised the minimum age to buy an AR-15 in FL	✅ Led to the first @HouseJudiciary Hearing on gun violence #HR8	#MSDStrong 	https://t.co/uSEOf7DLed

Yesterday at the @HouseJudiciary markup, activist groups sat with us for almost 11 hours as Republicans delayed the vote to close background check loopholes. But we persisted. These groups’ legacy will be #HR8. @MomsDemand @AMarch4OurLives #MSDStrong #NeverAgain https://t.co/DAyERtgzfP
When we experienced the shooting in Parkland a year ago, we lost a part of our soul in Florida. That is why yesterday was such an important day for us when @HouseJudiciary passed commonsense gun reform. #MSDStrong #NeverAgain https://t.co/th6Pq5lHQj

Today, I questioned the Administration at the @HouseForeign hearing to make sure the Administration is doing everything they can to help the Venezuelan people. We must continue to impose sanctions on the Maduro government and those supporting the Maduro regime. #VenezuelaLibreYa https://t.co/fulUuIxTDw
We just passed HR8 through committee. The first piece of significant gun legislation passed through @HouseJudiciary in 21 years. I will continue to stand for the safety of our communities and our children #NeverAgain #MSDStrong
We started at 10 am, it’s now 6 pm. @HouseJudiciary is trying to pass HR8, the universal background check bill, &amp; my @HouseGOP colleagues have tried to delay while making inappropriate personal attacks to us because the reality is they oppose ANY common sense gun reform.

There are many steps we must take to address the scourge of gun violence across this country. Closing background check loopholes will not prevent all deaths, but it’s an important first step. Today, I'm voting on @HouseJudiciay for commonsense gun reform https://t.co/XJgSZQs28Q
The issue of gun violence is deeply personal to me, and unfortunately, for far too many Americans. Gun violence is a leading cause of death for American children--far more children die in this country because of a bullet than because of cancer. #NeverAgain https://t.co/y6l26rYo9U

The Sebring, FL shooting took place less than two weeks ago. Far too many Americans are dying from gun violence whether through suicide, homicide, a mass shooting, or an accidental death, and Democrats are ready to take action to address the issue.

I announced nearly $4 million in Transportation and Infrastructure grants for #FL26. https://t.co/NIhqwnLc82
I co-signed the #RebuildAmericasSchools Act, which authorizes bold investment in public school facilities to create jobs, improve educational equality, and create better working conditions for teachers and school employees in every state.
I co-signed the Veteran Treatment Court Coordination Act, which helps veterans suffering from both physical and mental war wounds by allowing veterans charged with a non-violent crime attributed to physical or mental issues to receive comprehensive treatment instead of jail time.
I co-signed the Conflicts from Political Fundraising Act, addressing the fact that the American people should have the right to know when a presidential appointee has helped to raise money or made contributions to industries and political causes that they may soon be regulating.
I co-signed the Undetectable Firearms Modernization Act. This bill would prohibit the possession of firearms that are undetectable by walk-through metal detectors.
I co-signed the Wildlife Innovation and Longevity Driver (WILD) Act. This bill would provide much-needed protections to the natural habitats and wildlife we love, including sea turtles. It would also help control invasive species, like the python.
I participated in my first @HouseJudiciary hearing, where I advocated to protect voting rights and democracy #ForThePeople. https://t.co/iS3mMNPZrY

I stand with women’s rights, workers’ rights, and civil rights. That is why I am co-sponsoring the #PaycheckFairnessAct.
I am co-sponsoring the #PaycheckFairnessAct because women working full-time, year round are typically paid only 80 cents for every dollar paid to men.
More than 80% of black mothers are the breadwinners for their families. These mothers can’t afford to only make 63 cents on the dollar compared to white men. I support the #PaycheckFairness Act because I support families.
Latina women make 53 cents on the dollar as compared to non-Hispanic, white men. Latinas and their families can’t afford to wait decades for the wage gap to close. That is why I support the #PaycheckFairnessAct #EqualPay
I am a proud co-sponsor of the #PaycheckFairnessAct because the gender pay gap hurts women, children, and society as a whole. Supporting equal pay is supporting families.
Ten years ago, President Obama signed his first bill in office—The #LillyLedbetter #FairPayAct. Though this bill helped narrow the gender pay gap, we still have a long way to go to achieve equal pay.  https://t.co/dUkM1O49VC	https://t.co/saiQaBRUCN

We must help the Venezuelan people. Neighboring countries are doing their part by accepting refugees, and they need our help. We must provide aid to Venezuela and its bordering countries. #HelpVenezuela https://t.co/wSrMxUUwrq

@TheTinyDiplomat Thank YOU! I am energized and inspired by your passion. Don’t give up hope, we need people like you inspiring the leaders of tomorrow.
The #GOPshutdown is an environmental disaster for #FL26. Trash is piling up at national parks, poachers could go undetected, and the program that rescues beached marine mammals is shutdown. We must put our state over politics @marcorubio @SenRickScott https://t.co/wcGw61CDi8 https://t.co/KDUkvQgsMJ
When my staff said I'd made my @TheOnion debut ... I didn't think they'd use such a good picture. I've got your back, #FL26! #sayfie https://t.co/AIHDLH4Kil
Why does the President seem to care more about an ineffective border wall than children separated from their families at the border? https://t.co/lN0MGQqOBh https://t.co/rHcFWOtkrD
RT @TransportDems: Welcome to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, @RepDMP! https://t.co/ECOwSeg5d4
I am excited to lead my colleagues in introducing the American Dream Employment Act, a bill that will allow DACA beneficiaries to serve on Capitol Hill, just like in the private sector. #CIR https://t.co/93ck0pNQkO
As we enter day 27 of the shutdown, the issues facing citizens of #FL26 become more pressing. For Christopher, that means another day without the pay he needs to take care of his family. Share your own #GOPshutdown story here: https://t.co/lu3vUmrAcf https://t.co/BaXRnW7r39
My new position on the @HouseJudiciary Committee will allow me to reach across the aisle to fight for immigration reform and commonsense gun safety. I am excited to fight injustice and advocate for #FL26! 		Read more here &gt;&gt; https://t.co/3Cokaur5Ds

We are providing solutions to secure our border, not perpetuating political games. #endtheshutdown
5. Immigrants fleeing to America are often escaping violence, political instability and economic strife. Substantially funding the State Department’s Strategy for Engagement in Central America to address these issues would cost $750 million. https://t.co/VfdsbcO6cR
4. Last year, detection technology enabled border patrol to capture over 120,000 pounds of hard drugs. Investing in these technologies would allow legal ports of entry to run faster, better detect criminal activity at the border, and would cost $218 million. https://t.co/54DxQRTUqh
3. Border Patrol has begun investing in technologies that help detect undocumented immigrants hundreds of miles from the border. Investing in enforcement technologies such as blimps, surveillance towers, ground sensors, and tunnel detectors would cost approx. $400 million. https://t.co/6on4ePoAki
2. A shortage of immigration judges creates a backload of cases, forcing people to wait years for their hearings. Hiring enough judges and support staff would accelerate the immigration process and cost $638 million. https://t.co/Cp4LlLfqEn
1. Customs and Border Patrol is 6,500 agents short of the number it would need to fully patrol and protect the border. Hiring, training, and staffing the short fall would cost $1.3 billion. https://t.co/LSL6sEephc
A border wall is the most expensive and least effective approach to border security. Here are 5 alternative solutions to the President’s wall #realsolutions:
One can't visit the Everglades or the Keys and not leave determined to protect them for future generations. I will use my position on this committee to keep #FL beautiful by persistently advocating for restoring the Everglades and the preservation of South Florida and the Keys.
Few places in the world are more at risk than South Florida and the Everglades. That beautiful expanse of river grass and estuary, home to many endangered species, is woven into who we are as Floridians and Americans.
Our roads and bridges are in disrepair, we need to increase our resilience against upcoming major storms and sea level rise, and we must rethink our investments to lay the groundwork for a green energy future in order to fight the devastating effects of climate change.
It is my privilege to serve on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Our country is at a critical moment.	https://t.co/PU7nJFALo9
Rising sea levels do not care for which party you voted. We are all in this fight for our shared planet together. I am eager to work with both Democrats and Republicans on the House Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Committee to find solutions for #FL26. https://t.co/0ouOwk9FDG
Every day more Floridians are hurt by this shutdown. I need your help to call on Republicans to #endtheshutdown.		Share your shutdown story here &gt;&gt; https://t.co/rMZqJmBips
I just delivered my first floor speech! I talked about how our Miami community has come together to weather the shutdown, and I called on Senate Republicans to rein in this reckless President to #EndTheShutdown today. https://t.co/vvIVWPJgdt
Climate change is endangering one of our greatest natural resources: water. 		More Floridians are exposed to unsafe drinking water than almost anywhere else in the country. We must pass clean water legislation and protect our waterways. https://t.co/mN9KSXRX4i

It’s 2019, and it is still legal to pay women less than men in the US. I  am proud, honored, and excited to be a part of @HouseDemWomen because so long as this injustice continues, we will work to eliminate the gender pay gap for all women. #EqualPay https://t.co/OvuwnKMW4o
Thank you! I am excited to get to work for #FL26 and the American people. #ForThePeople https://t.co/SpB2kEpm1p
I led my colleagues in calling for @SenRickScott and @marcorubio to reopen the government. Glad to see you are supporting one commonsense measure to pay our Coast Guard. I hope you both do the same for all other government agencies today. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/kXJ3cOnCu5
The citizenship question on #census2020 was declared “arbitrary” by a federal court—in reality, it was rooted in racism intended to marginalize immigrants and people of color. This is a step towards a more inclusive country. https://t.co/tA4pTPGHp1
I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to push forward an ambitious agenda so our justice system works for everyone. Advancing the interests of #FL26 will never stop being my priority, and I’m eager to do so in my work on @HouseJudiciary. #sayfie
I will join this powerful committee at a time when our country is divided. While I will continue to be a check and balance on this Administration, it is my intent to use this position to seek common ground and consensus, not continue bitter partisanship.
This appointment will allow me to work on issues I’ve prioritized for years such as commonsense gun reform and repairing our broken immigration system.
It is my honor to serve on the @HouseJudiciary Committee. A committee that has a rich history of being at the forefront of momentous events since its founding – doing the difficult work of shedding light on injustices in our system.
"My faith in the Constitution is whole; it is complete; it is total. And I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution, the subversion, the destruction, of the Constitution." - Fmr. @HouseJudiciary member Rep. Barbara Jordan. I'm honored to serve w/Ds &amp; Rs https://t.co/lHCeo0r6kc
Standing with survivors and families of victims of gun violence is emotional and powerful, but it inspires me to work tirelessly everyday.	For my kids. 	For everyone in my community.		Let’s make universal background checks a bipartisan reality. #neveragain https://t.co/eNpS54iCdp
I’m standing with my colleagues to demand the Senate stop blocking bills to reopen the government. Too many Americans are hurting. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/697wl2Q3Fy
Today marks Day 25 that Republicans have allowed our government to be shutdown and our federal workers -- including our Coast Guard -- to go without pay. I visited Islamorada Station to hear directly from them.	#EndTheShutdown https://t.co/AkXOBHQoYo

Senator, the crisis we have is the one you’re manufacturing by keeping pay from 800K Americans including our Coast Guard &amp; TSA who keep us safe. Our national security is at risk.

Our Coast Guard work hard to keep us safe. This week I helped introduced legislation to ensure they’re paid for working during this shutdown. #EndTheShutdown https://t.co/qbBbPK3iXP
Republicans, you can #EndTheShutdown. You can stop Americans from hurting. You can make sure people are paid for keeping our country safe.	https://t.co/adjeYU0BMd
That was only week 1! Thank you, #FL26 for choosing me to represent you. Follow me for more updates.	#DMPWeekinReview
On Day One, we voted to expand Americans' access to the ballot box, reduce the influence of big money in politics, and strengthen ethics rules for public servants, because our government should work #ForThePeople.	https://t.co/JxXlUwVQRu
Signed on to a #ProChoice Caucus letter to @SecAzar in opposition to an unnecessary and onerous rule which seeks to push abortion coverage further out of reach for millions of women.
Signed on to a letter to @RonDeSantisFL to urge him to work with all parties to protect Floridians’ healthcare. #ProtectOurCare
Signed on to a letter to @SecretarySonny Perdue regarding the detrimental impacts of the shutdown on the SNAP program and asking what the plan for protecting families is until Republicans choose to #EndTheShutdown.
Led members of the Florida delegation in calling on Senator @marcorubio and @SenRickScott to no longer forego their constitutional duty to act as a co-equal branch of government and #EndTheShutdown.	https://t.co/acjs0TU8Rm
Supported legislation so that future generations can also enjoy the beauty of the Everglades. We are stewards of our planet, and it's time we worked together to converse it.	https://t.co/IuFetIjpnN
Co-sponsored legislation so that our hard-working members of the Coast Guard don't have to "consider garage sales, babysitting and acting as a 'mystery shopper' to make ends meet during the government shutdown."	I believe they should be paid. Period.	https://t.co/R83t1rE8gZ
I supported the COAST Act to permanently ban offshore drilling in the Atlantic, the straits of FL, and the Gulf of Mexico.	https://t.co/e5fM5Ho5qp
Despite Republicans refusing to open the government, we voted to make sure that when the GOP decides to re-open the government, federal employees are paid their wages.	https://t.co/5nSK22yDJe
I stood alongside @GabbyGiffords, @replucymcbath, @AMarch4OurLives, and survivors and families of victims of gun violence as we introduced #HR8 -- a bipartisan bill to finally make universal background checks a reality.	https://t.co/CF7V1QNiTD
What a week! After the press conference at MIA to #EndTheShutdown, I wanted to fill you in on some important work I did in my first week working for #FL26. #DMPWeekinReview
Thank you union workers, @RepDWStweets, and @RepShalala for helping highlight how Republicans are silent while this President is holding federal paychecks hostage to try and get the American people to pay for his wall. Americans are paying the price. #endtheshutdown https://t.co/ItIKd5d0fc
About to talk with @RepDWStweets, @RepShalala, and Professional Aviation Safety Specialist about the critical role federal employees play at MIA to keep us safe and on time. We’ve urged Republican senators to stop hurting Florida families and #EndTheShutdown now. https://t.co/628BuXUOSa
I can’t believe it’s already been a week since I was sworn in! Already voted to #endtheshutdown, clean up Washington and intro’d background checks. So much more to do! Now, on my way back to Miami to talk with Floridians impacted by the shutdown #FlashbackFriday https://t.co/YVV4qF4DOg

3 national emergencies that actually deserve the President’s attention instead of his wasteful wall:		1️⃣ Opioid epidemic	2️⃣ Rising sea levels	3️⃣ Gun violence		RT if you think this is just more Trump political theater.	#endtheshutdown	https://t.co/C84ii0TSlQ
Sintonízate a @cnnespan ahora! https://t.co/tzhDZUcnoj
Our voices are ringing louder than ever before. Proud to stand shoulder to shoulder against a wasteful wall and this Administration’s inhumane immigration policies.	https://t.co/FNUZeayYOC
13K Floridians -- including our hard-working Coast Guard -- shouldn't have to worry about getting paid. It's time Republicans do the patriotic thing and vote to #EndTheShutdown.		Didn't see my @CNNnewsroom interview? Check it out here. 	https://t.co/yh92u0qLzy
It’s 2019 but protections for people with pre-existing conditions and EVERY piece of the Affordable Care Act are still at risk. Today, I’m voting to keep those protections in place. 		Let’s #ProtectOurCare, not kick millions off their insurance.	https://t.co/7Q7sK04fRE
It's just one reason why today, my Florida colleagues and I wrote a letter demanding Senator @marcorubio &amp; @SenRickScott act as a co-equal branch of government and #EndTheShutdown.		Floridians are hurting. It's time they take action. https://t.co/suVkcUeBDM
When the federal government works with local communities like @FIU, we can make great strides to improve public safety. Yet another reason to #EndTheShutdown and continue helping Floridians!	https://t.co/WcnHCJs10v
The President continues to hold federal employees’ wages hostage.	Floridians are hurting.	Republicans are silent.	I’m voting for spending measures Republicans previously supported so we can #EndTheShutdown get to work #ForThePeople.	https://t.co/Q2ZwEe8FnL
We won’t be able to solve the gun violence epidemic, take action on climate change, or lower health care costs until we get big money out of politics. So on Day One, I voted for the biggest government reform. We need progress #ForThePeople now.	https://t.co/3Obifys6ak
It’s hard to worry about paying your bills when you’re worried if your child will be the next victim of gun violence. I’ve met with too many survivors and families of victims of gun violence.		We need universal background checks. Let’s pass bipartisan #HR8 and make it a reality. https://t.co/lggmrnpgpF
The President’s comments were disheartening. This was not an appeal to our hearts and souls. If he was concerned about people he’d keep the government open and federal employees — 13k in FL — paid.		#Endtheshutdown and let’s have a constructive debate about securing our border. https://t.co/C7GuVVyagB
After speaking with the @AMarch4OurLives leaders, gun violence survivors, and parents of victims, I’ve never been been more determined to get universal background checks passed than after we introduced #HR8 in their presence today. https://t.co/trC9RdWPRQ
Today, I was proud to walk onto the House floor w/@GabbyGiffords, @lucymcbath_, and other leaders in Congress introducing #HR8 to make universal background checks a reality. Also encouraged by our future leaders like @charlie_mirsky who will keep up the fight! #Enough https://t.co/rmBJwU7WEu
