Since 1978, the NFIP has paid nearly $52.5 billion dollars in flood insurance claims helping families and businesses recover. #FloodFacts
Flood insurance is mandatory for homeowners within a high-risk area, but we all are vulnerable to floods. #FloodFacts #Preparedness #Ready
If you choose to purchase flood insurance through NFIP, your policy won't take effect until 30 days after purchase. #FloodFacts #Prepare
Did You Know? Flood insurance claims are paid even if a disaster is not declared by the President. #FloodFacts #Preparedness #Ready
Purchasing flood insurance is a great way to #Prepare for the most common and costly natural disaster. #FloodFacts #Preparedness
