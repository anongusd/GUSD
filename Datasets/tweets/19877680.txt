I cannot believe how rude these reporters are. It‚Äôs so out of control.  Be called on. Ask your questions. But you don‚Äôt get to yell at the President, interrupt him, and ignore all decorum in a formal setting like this.  It‚Äôs just makes the media look even worse.

Wow. Jim Acosta refused to give up the mic even when a female staffer went to take it, yanking it back from her. Out of control.  Trump is now truly pissed. Watch out.

Serious Q for my lawyer friends. What am I missing here? Did I hear correctly that Cohen used his personal $ to payoff these women, then falsely submitted invoices to the corporation for payment for services. How can it be a campaign violation if it wasn‚Äôt paid by the campaign?

Apparently, the left thinks my kids should even be taken away from me because I tried to bring my oldest to be in the same room as the President. Think about that. Beyond ridiculous. Mama bear is NOT happy.  Seriously, what is WRONG with you people??  #dontmesswithmykids 2/3

@CounselorNachos Just demonstrating that both sides of deep government hide things from the American people. That‚Äôs a bi-partisan problem that is a cancer throughout all of the political class. 		In Haspel‚Äôs case she has served under both Rep and Dem oversight.
@HickersonPS63 @GOP @realDonaldTrump 17 years ago, the climate of fear, anger, and risk of another attack, made half this country willing to do whatever it took to stop another 9/11.  It was a very different time.
@MtnMD Actually, that is not at all a fact.  Trump‚Äôs daughter and son in law observe Judaism.  And, if you were watching the hearing you‚Äôd know that Haspel has said several times that she would not support any restart of an interrogation program at CIA. 		This is all political theatre.
Clearly I need to remind everyone that we aren‚Äôt talking about acts that happened last week.  We‚Äôre talking about things that happened almost two decades ago, in a very different time, with different rules in place. We know more now than we knew then.  That‚Äôs just reality.
@Brady5thOrBust @HickersonPS63 @GOP @realDonaldTrump I didn‚Äôt say I support torture. But, you do you. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
@CounselorNachos Good question.  What about when Hillary ignored oversight AND subpoenas, destroyed her devices, deleted evidence that had been subpoenaed and then ran for President? 		Government as a whole needs to be held more accountable. But I hold those who give the orders accountable.
@MtnMD I would hope someone intelligent enough to get an MD wouldn‚Äôt resort to hateful assumptions or calling people nazis.  And, I did not say I support torture.  So you are wrong on all accounts.
@GeeLauder I never said I was pro-torture.
@HickersonPS63 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Newsflash.  The big drama is over something that happened 17 years ago which has nothing to do with the current oversight committee. The committee has been both Democrat and Republican led over the last two decades.
@Cacaphony You are entitled to your opinion as is everyone. But demonizing her for following orders 17 yrs ago ‚Äî when threats were abundant, we were at high risk of another attack, and Americans were terrified to go to work in a tall building or get on a plane ‚Äî is just political theatre.
Newsflash. The CIA does not keep us safe by handing out lollipops and participation trophies. 		If you knew what they know you wouldn‚Äôt sleep well at night.

This! If it looks like duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck...it‚Äôs probably a duck. https://t.co/3GT3RtDw4j
@LarryOConnor @WashTimes Good question.
Important: It will be fascinating to see what Robert Mueller does now.  If he is as professional and unbiased as people say, how can he in good faith continue an investigation into the Trump campaign that was based on information gathered from improperly obtained FISA warrants?
The most important sentence in this memo:	FBI Dep. Director McCabe testified "that no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information."
According to FBI Asst. Dir. Bill Priestap, "corroboration of the Steele dossier was in its infancy at the time of the initial Page FISA application."
Ohr's wife was employed by Fusion GPS and worked on the Trump opposition research, paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign.  This relationship was "inexplicably concealed from the FISC."
!!!!!!!!!	Steel told Ohr he "was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president." This bias was"NOT REFLECTED IN ANY OF THE FISA APPLICATIONS."
!!!!!!!!!!	None of the FISA applications "disclose of reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or and party/campaign in funding" the Steele dossier even though it was "known to senior DOC and FBI officials"
"In the case of Carter Page, the government had at least FOUR INDEPENDENT OPPORTUNITIES before the FISC to accurately provide an accounting of the relevant facts. However, our findings indicate that...MATERIAL AND RELEVANT INFORMATION WAS OMITTED."
Three FISA applications were signed by Comey, one by McCabe.  Yates, Boente and Rosenstein each signed one or more of those on behalf of the DOJ.
So, ALL the FISA applications were certified by either Comey or McCabe, THEN approved by Sally Yates, Dana Boente or Rod Rosenstein.  All five were involved in knowingly sending a FISA application based on unverified, and biased information.  WOW. #MemoDay
Here‚Äôs the full PDF of the memo, along with the letter from the White House.  Stunning that top FBI/DOJ officials abused their positions of power by obtaining FISA warrants without disclosing the bias of the evidence they were using. Sad day.  #MemoDay https://t.co/6o3ZaR13L3

I'm totally watching CNN after this #SOTU is over.  I can't wait to watch them figure out how to analyze this speech.
"The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration...we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children. This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security, and our future." #SOTU
"The third pillar ends the visa lottery... It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system ‚Äî one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country." #SOTU
"The second pillar fully secures the border. That means building a wall on the Southern border, and it means hiring more heroes like CJ to keep our communities safe...and it finally ends the dangerous practice of ‚Äúcatch and release.‚Äù #SOTU
Trump on his Immigration Reform Plan: "The first pillar generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age ‚Äî that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration." #SOTU
As I'm listening to this speech, I'm hearing so many things that should make moderate democrats (who are Trump haters) very happy.  It'll be interesting to see their reaction post #SOTU.
LEFTIES... READ THIS CAREFULLY.  It's a message directly from @POTUS. #SOTU 		"So tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties ‚Äî Democrats and Republicans ‚Äî to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed. "
