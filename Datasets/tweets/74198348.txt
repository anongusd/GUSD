We will miss this one of a kind Texan and his kindhearted spirit that led America through some of her toughest times.
He was a tenacious leader beloved by Houstonians and Americans. President George H.W. Bush leaves behind a life and legacy that will be remembered as nothing short of iconic.
and father to a President. After decades of service to this great nation, he leaves behind a larger than life legacy. Finding his start in politics right here in Harris County, Texas, President H.W. Bush took his Texas work ethic to Washington.

Last night's drive by shooting at the Florida Republican campaign office is an attack on our political system and we must not allow our freedoms to be jeopardized by violence and fear. Americans must stand together against lawlessness and protect our most valuable freedoms.
The First Amendment is first because it is the most important. Freedom of religion and political expression are at the very basis of who we are as Americans. It must be protected. The murders in Philadelphia were fueled by hate and cannot be tolerated by anyone in this country.
These mass killings attack our “safe” places: churches, schools, and synagogues. We need a quick and swift trial of this hate crime. The punishment should be severe. All religions should condemn this violent attack on the basic human right of Freedom of Religion. (2/2)
The shooting and murders at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh is an assault on Jewish lives, an assault on religion, and an assault on the First Amendment. There is nothing worse than murder in a holy place, on a holy day. (1/2)
A look behind the scenes in the House Recording Studio. https://t.co/unz6dZ8Uad
Any and all acts of political violence must be condemned. Those responsible for the mail bombs must face the long arm of the law and be prosecuted for these criminal assaults on American citizens and our political system. Justice must be harsh and swift.

Technology may change, but the Constitution does not. America must be the leader, not the follower, in protecting our constitutionally guaranteed right to privacy. #internetprivacy
Americans must be given the ability to “opt-in” rather than “opt-out” of data sharing practices by private companies. Internet companies &amp; data service providers should adjust policies to reflect this renewed sense of urgency for privacy and data protections.#internetprivacy
In recent months, the American people have stood by as our privacy is whittled away in the digital frontier. With a single click, the terms and conditions that we speedily read over strip away the right to privacy; privacy that is often assumed to be protected. #internetprivacy

Judge Persky’s unjust sentence of a mere six months (of which he only served 3) for Stanford Rapist Brock Turner was revolting &amp; is an insult to victims of rape across the U.S. The same Constitution that protects defendants right also protects victims rights. Good riddance.
When sexual assault occurs (like the case of Brock Turner), the victim is sometimes given a life sentence of mental pain, anguish, and turmoil. Judge Persky seems to believe the equivalent punishment for the offender should be a mere apology. #JudgeAaronPersky #BrockTurner

It’s time we take a stand and take action for our volunteers who are some of the very best we have – and that is exactly what the Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act does.
Our Peace Corps Volunteers sacrifice years of their lives to help people they never even met – they are the face of our country in places where America’s shining beacon of hope and liberty may not always shine so bright.
It also ensures that ill and/or injured volunteers do not have to spend months dealing with federal bureaucratic red tape just to receive the care they need and deserve.
Far too often, our volunteers are injured, sexually assaulted, or contract severe diseases while serving overseas. This bill will ensure that our angels abroad have access to qualified medical professionals (in-country) &amp; extends protections for survivors of sexual assault.
H.R. 2259 provides much-needed protections for Peace Corps volunteers throughout every stage of their service: the onboarding process, while they are deployed abroad, and when they return home.
Great news! This morning, my legislation, the Sam Farr and Nick Castle Peace Corps Reform Act passed out of the @HouseForeign Committee. This important legislation sends a message to all current and former Peace Corps Volunteers that America stands with them.

(1/2) This morning, @realDonaldTrump announced the release &amp; return home of three American citizens, illegally held by the rogue North Korean regime, following the discussions conducted by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Most of all, it sends a clear message to the mullahs that the era of appeasement to their threats and evil ambitions is over.
2) Indefinitely prevent Iran’s ability to enrich uranium to a level to produce bombs	3) Strengthen the International IAEA ability to inspect all Iranian facilities suspected of involvement in nuclear weapons development.
With the POTUS decision, we have regained leverage to:	1) Push Iranians back to the negotiation table for a new agreement that will stop Iran’s ballistic missile development
This deal, also known as the JCPOA, has provided Iran access to billions of dollars to support terrorism, build ballistic missiles, and oppress the Iranian people, all the while providing Tehran a patient pathway to a nuclear arsenal.
President Trump’s decision to end America’s participation in the disastrous Iran nuclear deal is in the best interest of American national security.
The Iranian nuclear deal was crafted behind closed doors, without the approval of Congress. This deal, and the resulting ~$1.3 billion in cash airlift, was a huge mistake.

The National Guard should be deployed to the border upon the request of  the state Governor to help ensure that our homeland remains secure and  those who wish to enter the United States do so LEGALLY.@realDonaldTrump

During the 115th Congress, the House has passed 566 bills…As of today, 433 of these bills are stuck in the Siesta Senate. This is unacceptable. Change the Senate rules, the siesta is over!
POTUS @realDonaldTrump has it right. The Senate should take the nuclear option and require 51 votes to pass legislation. It’s far past time to undo this archaic 60 vote rule.

President @realDonaldTrump is right. The Second Amendment must NEVER be repealed. He is doing good work by filing our courts with strong constitutionalists.
Thus the war began and later the second amendment enacted.  	Supreme Ct Justices have armed security. How hypocritical of Justice Stephens to have personal armed guards but doesn’t want citizens to have arms to personally guard themselves!
Justice John Paul Stevens has called for repealing the Second Amendment. This sounds like something the Torys would have suggested during the Revolution! The battles of Lexington and Concord were started over the Brittish attempts to disarm the colonists

However, there is more to be done. We must also install floodgates and dredge the lake, increasing the water capacity. https://t.co/krLzqeNM0x
Now, the city has finally come to their senses. Lake Houston's water levels have been lowered from 42.5 to 40 feet, in anticipation of a significant rain event. This is a good first step &amp; will help prevent the surrounding area from flooding. https://t.co/mmDjTfu77f
Back in 2010, Lake Houston was so low that people could practically walk across the lake bed. @DanHuberty @MikeSullivanHTX and I met with the City of Houston and addressed dredging the lake while it was so low. The city refused.
Overall, the new KORUS is a victory for free trade, which levels the playing field and reinforces our bond with a crucial American ally. I congratulate Ambassador Lighthizer and @realDonaldTrump on negotiating a great deal.
Under updated trade pact:	-U.S. auto &amp; pharm industries gain greater access to South Korean market	-Korea’s custom procedures reformed to strengthen rules-of-origin requirements	-New process to address currency devaluation that gave South Korean exports an edge will be launched
The new U.S.-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS) is good for the American economy, good for American workers, and good for the U.S.-South Korean alliance.

9. Revamp the National Flood Insurance Program, for an effective and sustainable future.
8. At a federal level, explore restructuring possibilities for FEMA, removing it from the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security. Create greater accountability within the organization, preventing mass failures that occurred during Hurricanes
7. Buyout homes flooded beyond repair. I support homeowners' decisions to pursue a buyout and will work with my colleagues in the county, who ultimately make decision on which particular homes/areas to buyout (the City makes the decision for incorporated areas).
6. Increase the capacity of Lake Conroe, lowering the water level before significant rain events.
5. Dredge the San Jacinto River, returning to the river's original flow.
4. Dredge Lake Houston-Sand from mining operations has spilled into the lake, lowering the amount of water Lake Houston can hold. The sand should be removed from at the cost of the mining operations.
3. Require notifications of water release from Lake Conroe &amp; reservoirs. San Jacinto River Authority controls release of H20 from Lake Conroe. Sudden release during Harvey was done w/o prior notice to affected community, 1st responders, &amp; me. This lack of notice is unacceptable.
2. Expand the capacity of Addicks and Barker reservoirs, allowing the basins to hold more water backstream, helping mitigate overflow into the immediate communities.
1. A third and fourth reservoir must be created, further preventing flooding in the downstream areas including the Lake Houston area.
After continually monitoring the recovery process, I believe some of ideas that must be considered are:
The state of Texas now determines where this money is spent. It is up to our state and local government officials to act quickly to ensure that these funds are used to help our community recover and prevent future damage.
Since Hurricane Harvey rained down on our community, Congress has acted to provide $122.9 billion in total funds for disaster mitigation and flood control efforts.  The bipartisan Houston delegation has been instrumental in securing these federal funds.

The approval of this additional hurricane funding is a step in the right direction to prevent our community from devastation in the face of disaster. It is my hope that we will continue to strengthen this bill as it moves forward.
I will continue working with the Administration and the Army Corps of Engineers to ensure the creation of a third reservoir and to improve the Addicks and Barker reservoir system. For decades, we’ve been responding to floods rather than trying to prevent them.
In addition, funding will be made available for state and local officials to complete buyouts of condemned homes.
This afternoon, the House voted to approve $81 billion in disaster funding. Texas is eligible for a majority of these funds. A portion of this funding is allocated to disaster mitigation projects.
I urge @realDonaldTrump to quickly reauthorize SAFER and protect victims of crime, giving victims the justice they deserve. #RapeKit
In 2013, @JohnCornyn and I acted to fix this, introducing SAFER to reduce the number of untested rape kits by allocating already existing funding and resources to states and localities to audit their rape kit backlog. #RapeKit
This backlog forces a victim's hand, leaving them unable to produce evidence and pursue justice against their attacker. #RapeKit
Unfortunately, thousands of rape victims across the country are denied justice each day. For many, rape is a fate worse than death- a victim relives their trauma over and over again. In 2015, the DOJ estimated that there were as many of 4000,000 untested rape kits in the U.S.

We must be clear, anything less than a pure warrant requirement for any search on American persons in the 702 database is a failure of this body to protect the Constitutional rights of American citizens.
The ideals that were born in this country are now are weaker here than in other areas of the world.
In recent years the perception around the world is that the US is no longer the leader in privacy.
Now our privacy will be denied by the fact that these warrantless searches will continue.
FISA was created to go after Foreign Agents and terrorists, not Americans.
Anything less than a full 4th amendment warrant requirement based on probable cause means that the continual, warrantless spying on American Citizens will be permitted to continue.

After reviewing the latest Office of Management and Budget (OMB) supplemental request for disaster recovery, we find the proposal insufficient and unacceptable. @RepPeteOlson @farenthold @TXRandy14 @RepBrianBabin @RepMcCaul
@Change @RiceUniversity Check out H.R.1949 - Campus Accountability and Safety Act. Students deserve access to sexual assault coordinators on campus. Victims should receive help pursuing justice against their attacker and have access to trauma recovery services.

The passage of this legislation will help Texas with the recovery process and works to improve already existing flood protections. I urge the Senate to move quickly on this bill.
Most importantly for Houston, the legislation requires funding to be prioritized for properties that have experienced repetitive flood losses and improves mapping technology so that policies are based on more accurate information and data.
Today, Congress took another step forward- helping those affected by treacherous floodwaters. The 21st Century Flood Reform Act, passed today by the House, helps reform the floundering National Flood Insurance Program by injecting private market competition &amp; pragmatic reforms.

The legislation directs the President to levy these same terrorist sanctions on two dangerous Iranian militias operating in Iraq and Syria
Further imposing sanctions on these terrorist groups will put a stop on the Islamic Republic’s objective of “exporting the revolution.
Many of these groups have the blood of 100s of U.S. service members on their hands &amp; they take pride in allegiance to Iran’s Supreme Leader.
For years, Iran has supported a long list of terrorist actors that do its bidding and work to effectively make Baghdad an Iranian outpost.
This is merely the first step. We must continue to push back against Iran’s support for terrorism wherever it may be.

Human Trafficking is a scourge on our society and it's time to put a stop to it. And that's just the way it is.
Each year @RepJimCosta and I fight to protect the VOCA fund. We need all the help we can get to protect it.
As fathers we must take responsibility for what we teach our sons. They must learn this treatment and behavior towards women is not okay
Buyers of sex create the demand for human trafficking. We must change the conversation. We must be aware of who these people are.
Not in our city. Not in our town. Not in our society. It's time to #EndTrafficking
The conversation around human trafficking is beginning to change. I'm encouraged to see members of Congress joining the conversation.
We must work to end the demand of human trafficking. Go after the seller and the buyer. #EndTrafficking
TB to my days as Judge: I've introduced the SHAME Act allowing Judges to openly publish photographs of convicted buyers and sellers of sex. https://t.co/6DvP9Y9I0g
The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (now law) goes after the:	➡️Trafficker (seller)	➡️Customer (stop the demand)
RT @utsarver: Do not use the term “child prostitute”. They are a victims of sex trafficking. - @JudgeTedPoe #humantrafficking #texaslyceum
Judges must divert young trafficked victims into another system that works to recovery...not throwing them into the jailhouse.
Children cannot commit the crime of prostitution. They are a child. They cannot consent. They are a victim. NOT a "child prostitute."
Reality: victims vs criminal line is often blurred-we must separate the victims fm perpetrators. It's time to treat victims like victims.
No taxpayer dollars are spent. The fund helps victims of crime recover their lives and seek services they need. The fund grows every yr.
We must concentrate on helping victims of human trafficking. The Victims of Crime Fund (VOCA) belongs to solely to victims of crime. https://t.co/jeAKxCldvo
As a Judge I saw what was happening to young women who were trafficked &amp; knew we must take action to end this scourge on society.

There is a mandatory evacuation from the @Arkema_Inc plant ONLY within a 1.5-mile radius. @HCSOTexas https://t.co/Zl1RqQsGeM
@HCSOTexas @Arkema_Inc @arkema Smoke is noxious. @Arkema_Inc asks people to respect 1.5-mile radius. Do not know how long situation is going to go on.
@HCSOTexas @Arkema_Inc @arkema Anticipation is that all products will burn and not be released into flood waters.
@HCSOTexas @Arkema_Inc @arkema Plant is waiting for waters to recede. Not going to put ppl in harm's way to try to restore refrigeration until they know it's safe.
@HCSOTexas @Arkema_Inc @arkema .@Arkema_Inc says toxicity of smoke will cause irritation of eyes and throat. Encouraging people not to be exposed. Belive ppl out of harm
@HCSOTexas @Arkema_Inc @arkema Waiting for @Arkema_Inc to release exactly what chemicals are exploding. Says they will. Rep says situation is fire, not chemical releases.
@HCSOTexas @Arkema_Inc @arkema Liquid nitrogen was set up as well, but the system failed due to flood waters. Containers were last ditch effort.
@HCSOTexas @Arkema_Inc @arkema Protection measures taken include shutting down plant. Multiple layers of refrigeration (power supply, emergency generators)
@HCSOTexas @Arkema_Inc @arkema .@Arkema_Inc Pressure release valves on containers. The popping is from the pressure release. They have no one on ground.
@HCSOTexas @Arkema_Inc .@Arkema rep says: fully expect that other 8 containers will "pop." Safest thing to do is to allow products to degrade or burn.
@HCSOTexas Now @Arkema_Inc speaking at Press Conference: Unprecedented storm. Extraordinary efforts taken to protect products involved.
@HCSOTexas Situation inside facility: Facility is completely shut down. Issue inside storage facilities and truck. Water still inside. Photos to come
@HCSOTexas Not all containers have lost refrigeration. Not sure what the fuel and capacity are inside other containers. 9 box vans, and 1 has popped.
@HCSOTexas Orginal concern was that deputies car AC sucked in smoke from plant. Sent to area hospitals as a precaution due to potential chemicals.
@HCSOTexas Anything can happen, so @HCSOTexas is being cautious. Plan is in place if situation escalates. Technical definition does not meet explosion.
@HCSOTexas Watching where smoke may go. Evacuation zone is more than adequate.
@HCSOTexas Overflight was conducted in last hour. There is a fire inside one of the container. Visible flames. Containers will continue to "pop"
Update from @HCSOTexas: Fire at plant. Hazmat team is operating with plant since Tuesday. Area has been evacuated for 1.5-mile radius.
.@HCSOTexas says the Crosby chemical plant smoke is what impacted deputies. All are being treated and are okay.
@HCSOTexas says @Arkema_Inc plant was  "release" of organic peroxides, created a pop and to be clear is not an explosion.

This must stop – if we want to stabilize Afghanistan, we must deal first with Pakistan.

Pakistan supports terrorist groups of all stripes operating inside Afghanistan, providing them with money, arms, and logistical support.
