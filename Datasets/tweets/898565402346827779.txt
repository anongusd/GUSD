If Republicans in Congress do not have the courage to pass legislation countering this irresponsible usurpation of power, then it will be clear that Republicans have no interest in preserving the system of checks and balances that is the foundation of our system of government.
The American people cannot and will not accept this as normal, and we support calls by the Democratic leadership to use every remedy available to reverse this waste of taxpayer dollars.
We also note that President Trump himself acknowledged earlier today that his emergency declaration was unnecessary, which will no doubt further undermine the legal standing of this reckless decision.
By ignoring the separation of powers enshrined in our constitution, Trump is setting a dangerous precedent for our democracy, and we call on Congress and the courts to act.
There is no emergency at our southern border. President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency is a blatant abuse of power and is unconstitutional.

We encourage @IlhanMN to apologize to the Jewish community for her painful words, and to join us in a candid conversation about these critically important matters. https://t.co/Yx9g8P5uaL
The inability of Rep. Omar to recognize this reality and her choice to repeat an anti-Semitic trope underscores that she is completely out of step with the Democratic party on this issue.
That is why an overwhelming majority in both parties and chambers of Congress have been steadfast in their support of Israel – because it’s a view shared by their constituents.
The leadership of the Democratic party is firmly pro-Israel because they understand that the United States and Israel share strategic interests and values, and that support of the U.S.-Israel relationship is shared by the American people.
We are deeply concerned that a member of Congress would share such incendiary views and, as a proud member of a religious minority herself, Rep. Omar should know better. As a member of Congress, Rep. Omar’s constituents and the American people deserve better.
We condemn Rep. Omar because her statement represents a form of anti-Semitism that has historically been used to target Jews.
We have repeatedly condemned Donald Trump and other Republicans for condoning and encouraging anti-Semitism, as well as other forms of discrimination, and we hold all public officials to the same standard.
At a time when anti-Semitism is increasing at home and abroad, it is vital that members of Congress speak out against bigotry in all its forms, and not repeat hateful conspiracy theories and tropes targeting any one religious or ethnic group.
Rep. Ilhan Omar’s decision to publicly repeat an anti-Semitic trope suggesting that Jewish money is directly correlated with political influence is deeply offensive and painful.

JDCA condemns the anti-Semitic remarks of Washington, D.C. Councilman Trayon White. While we appreciate his apology, we will not tolerate anti-Semitism in the public square, and especially not when it comes from elected officials. https://t.co/TqWHNTgTdG
JDCA condemns the racist remarks made by Rabbi Yitzchak Yosef. It is unacceptable for the Chief Sephardic Rabbi of Israel to use such toxic language. Now more than ever we must stand against racism.
#WomensHistoryMonth Emma Lazarus, author of “The New Colossus” (inscribed on the Statue of Liberty), wrote poetry that brought the Jewish experience into the mainstream. She fought to protect Jewish refugees and for Jewish sovereignty in the late 1800s. A true trailblazer! https://t.co/yHGZsXYDaj

READ: JDCA board member @JoelMartinRubin in @jdforward: "By pushing a policy that harmed his own agency and undermined him on Capitol Hill, Tillerson not only gained little support from the White House, but instead facilitated his own demise."	https://t.co/q35elYTcbB
"As an organization and wider community, we strive to reach across religious and racial divisions to work for mutual understanding and social justice. American Jews and African Americans are long-standing partners in the fight to create a more equitable and inclusive country."
"As we have said before, Farrakhan is a vile anti-Semite who has slandered our community and launched hideous attacks on women, gay people and other groups. We expect our politicians to disavow him, as part of their commitment to equality and the fight against anti-Semitism."
