@Ilhan Voter turnout was due to pack of interest in Who was running.  #noexcuse. The black community had no reason to vote.....obama wasnt running.
@Ilhan Provide proof. Blacks can vote by mail. #noExcuse. #blexit
@Ilhan Polla ahould close in a reasonable hour. VOLUNTEERS need to get home too. If u cant gwt to the polls.....absentee ballot is an option. So ur point is moot.
@Ilhan American citizens have the rights to vote, not illegals or felons. 		You dont see a reason to reform, you see ppl u can promiae the world and give them nothing. #blexit and #WalkAwayFromDemocrats has taken a toll on ur voting base.
