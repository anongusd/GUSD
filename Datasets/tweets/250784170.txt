Energetic audience. Jake didn‚Äôt butt in. Harris was appealing.
Softball question about a child of immigrants. Already a Harris voter, I‚Äôd bet.
She turns free trade into fair trade question. Dems in a bit of an awkward position here.
Tariff question! Good one.
All the questions so far are from the left. Understandable, but I‚Äôd like to see other questions. I know. It‚Äôs January of 2019. Plenty of time. Fine. But ask about the deficit, crime and terrorism.
I never get invited anyway. https://t.co/9sHWtmO77z
Maybe a swing voter from suburban Des Moines should get a question. Someone from Clive, Iowa, possibly.
Harris just ducked the question about the very rich. She said the super rich need to pay more taxes, but that wasn‚Äôt the question.
@SeanTrende I watched season 1 and enjoyed it but didn‚Äôt get past episode 1 of season 2.

@On_Politike @FiveThirtyEight Seven points? You can believe that if you want. I don‚Äôt ‚Äî unless the NBC News/WSJ pollls show it. Seven is more than double what I believe. Seven points on the margin or 7 points in his approval? Don‚Äôt focus on the margin.

On Hannity, Lara Trump just said that only Hillary colluded with the Russians. Just so you know. I wouldn't want you to be confused and think that someone in the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow.
By the way, if I type collution, I probably mean collusion.

Trump should learn a trade. Making license plates.

Who is going to win in PA 18? I really don't care. The outcome is clear.
I have started writing. Please look for my Roll Call coliumn in the morning.
CNN seems to be missing the point of this outcome. They are so focused on who wins and who loses.
RT @ryanstruyk: With an estimated 87% of the vote reporting in #PA18 via @CNN:		Conor Lamb 50.4%	Rick Saccone 49.0%
Of course it would be better for Democrats if Lamb won the race. But we are all watching the contrest for an indication about the Trump coalition. In that sense, it's less important who wins than how well the two candidates run compared to Trump.
Saccone is going to win narrowly or lose narrowly. Either way is a problem for Republicans in a CD won by Trump by 20 points. GOP voters either stayed home or flipped to Lamb. It's as simple as that.
"Too close to call" with 65% of the vote in is enough to draw a conclusion. So, while I can't call the race, I'm calling a conclusion. This contest is a red flag for the GOP.
Good Lord. https://t.co/Jqx9NacOki
