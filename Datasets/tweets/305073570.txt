@georgemagnus1 Yes. Agreed.
@georgemagnus1 I think there’s an arguable case that is true. But equally easy to argue the reverse. 		Problem has been change in trend necessitating greater austerity -it was (until 2015) done reasonably fairly - and imagining there was a simpler way often ignores those nasty truths
@ianmulheirn Previsely
@ajb_powell It affected the cash measure of the deficit (a lot) but that is not the measure we quote PSNBex (ie excluding banks)		Most was auto-stabiliers because revenues went through the floor, but a large VAT cut and generous public spending plans kept in place
@ajb_powell None was bailouts - that was accounted for as a financial transaction -
Was 10% of GDP deficit not sufficient fiscal action in ‘09?		We already had an inter generational housing crisis in 2007 when interest rates were &gt; 5%. 		So in my book, the facts don’t remotely stack up... https://t.co/IYEo6eLL54

@JackGilmour18 @afneil I literally directed you to the primary source with the link
@JackGilmour18 @afneil It's reasonable not to be sure. But 1.5% is a published number and the data you put there is only a small subset of data required to have a reasonable guess. Annual growth figures are not the same as year on year changes in the fourth quarter
@ericasalford @afneil I have no expertise in Islands tied to the UK.		For the UK - whatever future staying in the EU would produce - the outcome from Brexit will be worse. How much worse depends on the type of Brexit pursued. 		Sensible estimates already put the losses in the 1.5% to 2.5% of GDP range
@t0nyyates @samlangfield @asentance @afneil And I thought you were bigger than that Tony
@HenryNewman @EU_Commission I understood and I agree. But the 2019 forecast will be influenced significantly by the second half of 2018, and hardly at all by the second half of 2019, so your reading of the table was correct, but the description was a bit off.		It's just how the maths works.		I can explain
@HenryNewman @EU_Commission Yes - it is true that the 2019 annual growth forecasts are as you say. 		Note, though, that is different from your comment comparing this year's growth rates because the annual change is not the same as the growth in a year
@WarsawLloyd @afneil The German statistical authorities always publish the annual total first before the final quarter.		This is well known...It's on the front page of the website
@afneil Andrew - the numbers you used for Germany and France have been published and yours were wrong. 		Since you have been shown your errors and are not backing down, it appears that you are now lying rather than just mistaken
@SurreyCricBlog Because the quarterly change is the average of the level in the fourth quarter compared with the average level in the third quarter.		If you add them up (roughly) you are comparing Dec with Sep - which is a legitimate comparison, but a different one

@fiscaccountant @UKStatsAuth No - we would reform the RPI. It is hard-wired into primary legislation. Cannot and should not be killed. 		We should do exactly what the Lords said. Repair the clothing error immediately. Then take time to reform RPI so that it reflects inflation properly

@JamesHeywood93 Thanks James. Vindication is good. Victory will be when change happens. 		Looking more likely now....
@bswud In many cases- yes that is likely to be the implication. 		There were £233bn index-linked gilts outstanding in 2010 when the clothing price error was made - so price changes are simply windfalls for existing owners, not the market adjusting
That is why we know it is an error, which requires fixing by @UKStatsAuth, not brushing under the carpet		And HOL are right that by not fixing it, the resulting gap between RPI and CPI or other measures provides incentives for index-shopping, many of which ministers have taken
The RPI and CPI both use both arithmetic and geometric means in different parts of their formulas. 		The issue in the 2010 clothing price change is an interaction in the RPI between one specific arithmetic mean (there are many) and the specific bundle of prices collected

@KimDriver11 True for post 2010 bonds. False for £233bn earlier contracts. 		The later bonds have v clear caveat emptor clauses on RPI measurement. 		Are you telling me investors don’t read contracts ( and many of them are hedged because their liabilities are RPI linked)
@SjScholefield @UKStatsAuth Well, quite
@MacGregorAK @UKStatsAuth No. There is no conspiracy here. There are Labour peers on the committee eg Alistair Darling. 		They took copious evidence and didn’t pull punches
@asentance Yes. That was a @UKStatsAuth figleaf to cover its 2013 error. But could never work because RPI is hard-wired into primary legislation (the only stat for which this is true) and many contracts. 		So it was always doomed

@JoMicheII @ONS That's a fair point Jo. But here is a simple suggestion. 	Have a "theme week" with the data coming out sequentially	 - balanced GDP	 - BoP	- Business investment	- flow of funds	You would know that at the end of the week you can still do exactly as you could today. Everyone happy
@asentance @ONS Yes - that's an irritation on "prices theme day"
@ONS I have made these points before to @ONS and was told it was useful feedback and they would think again. (That was September 2017)		But it is becoming clear that "think again" meant "la la la, we're not listening"		Sometimes you wonder who ONS think they are trying to serve
@ONS The split of quarterly national accounts from the sectoral accounts is unhelpful. A balanced set of GDP figures on one day in one release is what users need		Business investment details, flow of funds, balance of payments can be done on different days. That would be helpful
@ONS At the very least - ONS could have scheduled public finances on a different day to national accounts		Both are complicated releases
Having waded through all these releases from @ONS today, there has to be a better way of releasing this information	 - the number of clicks needed is absurd 	- sometimes it's vital to go to the PDF, others not - crazy	- far too much information for one day		Please think again

@josceline Anyway - nice to interact. I hope this provides some food for thought - people are far too quick to slam GDP figures when they're pretty good in advanced economies
@josceline There is nothing wrong with these measures - GDP is telling us the economic flows - and GDP per head divides this by the number of people. 		It's not the right measure for everything. It doesn't do distribution at all. But for average prosperity, it does a very good job
@josceline You have a baby - which doubles as a consumption good and an investment good.  if births&gt; deaths GDP per head falls because the flows of money need to be shared more widely. This is also correctly measured. 		When the baby grows up and is economically active, it produces GDP
@josceline You're getting rather too worked up, if I may say so. 		You have a pig (installed capital) from which you want a return - when you sell the piglet you get that return that year. It is a flow of income. GDP measures this absolutely fine...
@josceline Neither necessarily has any effect on GDP. Neither involves any market transaction. Nor an imputed transaction. The second has an effect on GDP/head, but that is not what you wrote. 		Now, you explain

The upshot is the Chancellor says the losses are minimal		3.9% of GDP is	- almost 3 years growth gone	- about £100bn a year by 2030 in today’s prices	-about £1,100 per person each year	- raises public borrowing by roughly £25bn a year on govt figures
If the model was more dynamic, the losses would be larger. An endogenous investment variant adds further losses -up to 2.3%		Migration is important. If net EEA migration fell further (assumption is zero) the losses larger
The central case is the dead as a dodo Chequers plan. 		Officials refused to model the backstop at all		The reason 3.9% scenario is closest to the deal:	- it includes EEA migration falling	-it accepts trade with EU will not be frictionless	- but the frictions are less than a FTA
The analysis will be controversial. Not because the figures feel massaged. But the modelling strategy is odd

@HuntedTeamNick Best way to think about this is to assume jobs stays constant but some/many will have to find worse work or accept wage reductions compared with staying in. 		Who is hit hardest is beyond this type of analysis
@ManusBlessing Of course. Mostly a misunderstanding over what this sort of analysis can and can’t say. Doesn’t preclude other analysis
@zoemum @UKandEU Yes they do. Remember the economy will be a lot more than £2,000bn by then so it is 5.5% (gdp per head). Upper estimate
@HuntedTeamNick Yes. And he is right. 		But that can’t be part of a long term economic analysis because people lose and gain jobs all the time. 		The real problem is that we’ll all be poorer and some will be a lot poorer
@JohnSpringford Completely agree. But we can’t model it with any accuracy. That’s why there is a need for people like Brian to add colour and real experiences to these estimates.
Since the most important element in these assessments is a productivity element, not an employment element - the jobs lost figure would generally be zero. 		So, I respectfully disagree, Brian https://t.co/nIV1MfNYb9
@TorstenBell @EvanHD But that was a sequential voting procedure, which has some severe drawbacks if the purpose of the exercise is to reveal true preferences...
@SarahRosemary3 The baseline GDP per person is expected to be roughly £36,000 in 2030 (but today's price level)		None of this takes distribution into account, which is really hard, but I think it would be fair to say that poorer people generally have lower £ losses, but higher % losses
@royjthomas @FT @OBR_UK @ftwestminster @fteconomics I would expect a lot more from govt. Not from OBR though, which has a specific mandate - unless that mandate was changed in order to add legitimacy to official analysis
@steveruffley @LiveSquawk @UKandEU That's your perspective. I don't think they're meant to shock, but just inform. 		It's perfectly reasonable to say they are about a third of the GFC - that was a lot worse. Just not sure people understand how much that hurt them, so better to put into £££

@FergusMMurray @lionelbarber @NIESRorg @peoplesvote_uk @FT Hi Fergus, the meaning and context was independent of government, but I accept there is another unintended interpretation. Importantly, there was a link to the original piece, and the results of NIESR's study were more modest than those of UK in a Changing EU
@FergusMMurray @lionelbarber @NIESRorg @peoplesvote_uk @FT Perhaps I can explain Fergus,		As you can see from the screenshot, I described @NIESRorg as independent and the report as funded by People's vote. 		All true, all fair, all complete https://t.co/wU1OvKP9ZA
@NothingToFear16 @NIESRorg @UKandEU For all their criticism, gravity models are extremely accurate at predicting trade patterns. 		What is much less certain is the link between the results of these models and domestic economic performance. 		That is v poorly specified in any model
@NothingToFear16 @NIESRorg @UKandEU The Brexit studies ask a different question - accepting the world is uncertain and lots of other things go on. 		They simply ask how much does the UK’s EU and other trading relationships still matter when so much else is going on		This limits the scale of losses in Brexit studies
@NothingToFear16 @NIESRorg @UKandEU Yes. I will assume that was a genuine question and explain why. 		Your question asked for an absolute forecast. Those depend on lots of unknowns (oil prices, relative growth rates etc)		No one would have got those right. And other histories would have made those results different
@steveruffley @LiveSquawk @UKandEU Yes. Considerably less. About a third. 		No one much liked GFC so I’m not sure that’s a great selling point
There are 2 conclusions you can take from these studies		1) The results are similar because different strategies lead to the same conclusion when both assume the Brexit deal increases trade friction. 		2) it would be odd for the government to come to a radically different result
So you get this sort of picture and no deal (not including short term disruption) is much worse https://t.co/pXh2Qy2Ivq
The big and most questionable assumption in the @UKandEU model is the use of an academic study that says trade losses translate into productivity losses. 		Whether this assumption is correct determines the £700 to £2,000 range. The authors are explicit about the uncertainty
The @NIESRorg analysis is largely based on using its big macro model and looking at greater trade frictions. 		@UKandEU take a modular approach, like the government’s cross Whitehall briefing. A general equilibrium trade model + a productivity assumption + fiscal consequences
It is a very different beast (in terms of modelling) to @NIESRorg yesterday, but comes to very similar estimates of loss https://t.co/NruUzp792h
Today, @UKandEU published its economic assessment of Theresa May’s Brexit deal. 		It puts the range of annual losses between roughly £700 and £2,000 per person Theresa May’s Brexit deal to cost up to £2,000 a year per person https://t.co/2DZG3ypFaR
TRUMP MIGHT NOT KNOW WHAT HE’S TALKING ABOUT		I think someone is confusing “trade” with “do a trade deal” https://t.co/MgZL7fa0nr
@mellenoweth Yes. That’s why it is a key uncertainty they deal with in sensitivity testing
@george_yarrow Increased demand for services
Brexit is, sadly, a boon for comfy-class economists such as me. 		I wish it wasn't so, but within the overall losses there will be distributional effects. And because the of overall Brexit losses, economists will do fine https://t.co/JcUi875RzB
@VanishingPoin_t OK - I misunderstood. 		Yes-  in future comparisons should be like-for-like as far as possible. 		Suggests a doppelganger approach (even though they have their problems too).
@MESandbu Macro effect from lower £ I presume
@VanishingPoin_t Not easily -  they would be wide.		Direction is clear - magnitude is not. Partly this is because there is nothing specific in the deal, especially on services
@NHS_Analyst Yes. Unbelievably stupid marketing by People’s Vote I reckon. The main study doesn’t do anything a dumb as shout £100bn blah blah
@VanishingPoin_t You misunderstand. The comparison here are all U.K.  this is not comparing U.K. vs EU
@VanishingPoin_t It doesn’t assume that. There is a v minor bounce
RT @jagjit_chadha: Compressing trade also tends to hurt activity and average incomes. Our work calibrates this mechanism in terms of the EU…
@ChrisStevenson1 Sure. The loss is about £700 to £1,100 a year per person every year. 		This compares to an average income of roughly £30,000 per person every year

@kingstongate @retepelyod You want ultimately to include all of this. NIESR have implicitly but leave the damage to date out of the main calculations
@BySpoke @NIESRorg They have made 2 assumptions. 		1. The backstop. (Quite easy to model)	2. Assuming NI fixed, a Canada style agreement that Brexiters want. 		There are other possibilities.
The upshot is that Theresa May’s deal will make us poorer		Scale?		About a third of financial crisis
And we should remember that these are conditional forecasts. They are relative to a baseline (which will be wrong). 		Baseline in pic below		That makes them more precise. 		It’s like doctors saying “drugs are bad”, rather than saying “that smack will shorten your life by 6 mins” https://t.co/smOuM26iv3
As per pic. The big assumption @NIESRorg make is that Brexit harms services productivity. This is reasonable but the least well evidences part of the research. 		Some will also question the scale of the trade losses (up to 46%). That is less important though in generating losses
It’s vague in places because the deal is vague. The big assumptions		1. There would be a minor bounce if U.K. stayed in durably	2. Canada style deal (if NI sorted) costs £1,100 a year per person by about 2030 (see pic)	3. Backstop costs £700 because customs union an advantage https://t.co/H7aoEfMZSB

@billwells_1 @asentance @dsmitheconomics @rebeccasriley @shjfrench @EdConwaySky NIESR today have done most of its assessment on GDP per head, so you’ll be happy Bill
@retepelyod No. All except BoE are doing Remain as main counterfactual I believe
@fascinatorfun 1. It’s tricky to be precise, but that is a wasted effort anyway. We can be clear about major differences in assumptions		2. Yes		3. Yes		4. As far as possible
@keefeglise It's the counter factual of remain which provides the comparison. 		So yes- this deal is better than the default. Not clear it's better than current forecasts imply (as they have varying assumptions in them). And worse than Remain
@FraserNelson Yes - that was true - briefly. They also had higher wages IIRC so the real income aspect probably about right
@FraserNelson With the exception of the Treasury forecasts - most of the other ones did just fine
@SaHreports They were - and these should be consistent with those too
I fear officials might be pressured into doing something like that. 		So, if you want a benchmark - this is something I wrote earlier this month - which still applies	https://t.co/iXAvoms28k
The studies must be plausible.		The following, for example, would fail the test		1) Little damage to services because there will be a better deal agreed	2) Frictionless trade in goods because that will be agreed	3) Big gains from other trade deals
The long term assessments should be in a range - because there is nothing beyond the backstop agreed.		That range should be saying an economic hit of around 2-5% depending on the precise assumptions.
Any short term assessment  - should have a MINOR uplift "deal dividend" - heavily offset by higher interest rates		The political declaration is far too vague to plausibly include a big bounce for certainty
IF THEY DO - THEY HAVE BEEN MASSAGED

So if you take this chart from  @samueltombs. If Q1 growth was artificially weak and Q2/Q3 artificially strong (Q3 coming soon at 0.6 or so), the underlying growth rate appears to be around the 0.35 mark

@JoMicheII @jmackin2 @D_Blanchflower So you end up wit the Ed Balls question- was it too far, too fast. 		Too far? I’d say no for long term prudential reasons. 		Too fast? Quite possibly but the difference unlikely to change history much
@JoMicheII @jmackin2 @D_Blanchflower The evidence for the long austerity is that we have been dealing with low productivity growth and the causal relationship between austerity and it appears to be weak
@JoMicheII @jmackin2 @D_Blanchflower To be clear, I think there’s a perfectly legitimate debate around speed of deficit reduction, but think there were not huge gains to be had from doing it v differently. 		Perhaps ex post some gains, but to suggest it would have been transformational appears to me to be deluded
@JoMicheII @jmackin2 @D_Blanchflower Unlike the 1980s, the plausible hysteresis paramater is surely zero. Little long term unemployment etc etc		TO have little effect on debt, you must be assuming a lot more spare capacity, no?
@JoMicheII @jmackin2 @D_Blanchflower You only have to do the maths on the size of NGDP necessary for the deficit to have kept  the debt burden stable to realise the multipliers involved were ridiculous. 		Remember- we have lots of candidates for why growth slowed in 2011 (food prices, energy prices, eurozone)
@JoMicheII @jmackin2 @D_Blanchflower The evidence I was referring to was the suggestion that a lack of spending had caused the deficit and debt to balloon. 		It's as stupid as saying Labour solely was responsible for the GFC.
@HowardRReed Only you know it. And we know people guess wrong
@HowardRReed You know me, Howard
@GrahamWhitham I thought I was clear originally and it wasn't controversial. At least, it wasn't in the past. 		I was wrong on both counts
@GrahamWhitham Yes. Do proportions of income change at different points in the income distribution - this tells you about progressivity of a tax change. 		Don't do cash changes or proportions of cash going to different bits of the distributions alone, because alone they are bollocks
@JoMicheII @jmackin2 @D_Blanchflower Agree.		My rough answers are "not much, perhaps a little" and "not in any very noticeable way". 		I don't see a great harm in giving it a go, but don't hold out huge hopes for the outcomes.
@soniasodha @MikeBrewerEssex @MattCowgill I did say - progressivity and hence fairness - very specifically because progressivity is a clear concept and it tells us nothing about that
@soniasodha @MikeBrewerEssex @MattCowgill If you want to know that, it's not irrelevant.		But if you, in any way, suggest the results of your knowledge tell you anything about progressivity and hence fairness, you are misusing the information
RT @benwansell: This from @ChrisGiles_ is fascinating from political perspective. All the fiscal action is in era of 1970s and 80s, except…
@GrahamWhitham I have never suggested anything else
@julianHjessop That suggests (as I think I thought) it's only the gross operating surplus that's in receipts. So that wouldn't be rents, but rents-expenditure (ie operating profit)		Do we agree?
@soniasodha @MikeBrewerEssex @MattCowgill Actually, I just want to know how progress/regressive a tax change is. 		The "xx% of the cash cost of yy tax change goes to xx% of the population" does not let me do that
@MikeBrewerEssex @MattCowgill I wasn't complaiing about distributional analysis, but the spread of the 		"xx% of money from yy change goes to the top zz% of the income distribution"		formulation. It's really unhelpful and does not inform us about the progressivity of a tax/benfit change
@JoMicheII @jmackin2 @D_Blanchflower I think you need to define "a lot". I know we need to be vague, but I would define it as "a little".		OECD figure is bonkers.
@K_Niemietz It’s the form of analysis. The ones that make any change look regressive because the rich are, rich, so will have bigger cash effects of any change
@MattCowgill Distributional analysis is hugely valuable. 		But a number saying 90% of tax cuts go to the top 10% is bollocks because that change would be progressive if that group had more than 90% of the relevant tax base. 		So, it’s a massively unhelpful way of doing distributional analysis
@julianHjessop Yes. But not clear what counts as a receipt here (I have forgotten). Not rail fares I presume
@jmackin2 @PhilAldrick @MrRBourne Yes. And any tax would have been measured anyway
Much as I admire you, I am taking to you @resfoundation
A PLEA. Can we stop doing cash distributional gains going to different parts of the income distribution. And proportion of total cash being spread around. 		You need to know the underlying incomdistribution for these figures to be meaningful. 		Alone they are bollocks.

@MrRBourne Not much more. 1999-00 current receipts then was estimated at 39.2%		We now think the same year was 35.1%		Quite a change
@MrRBourne @georgeeaton The reason consolidation took longer than planned in 2010 is simple. Productivity growth was slower (in UK, US and everywhere). Very little evidence the productivity slowdown was caused by the deficit reduction....
Here is the 1999 red book 1970 to 1999 https://t.co/Jx5OOQeEW0

Bet that would go down well in Guardian towers!		It is a std assumption in this kind of stuff and one of the reasons why the "it's easy" line should be resisted https://t.co/N9cd05s4DT
@DuncanWeldon @JoMicheII A multiplier of SEVEN on public investment is pretty punchy. I haven't seen the OECD research - (bet it doesn't exist)
@gabriel_mathy @DuncanWeldon Yes. That is quite different from what the Guardian was advocating. Larry never suggested multipliers &gt;2 but thought the debt/GDP ratio could fall in the exceptional circumstances of the 2012 period.
@jxrisk @D_Blanchflower Well, if you believe in the multiplier fairy , anything is possible...		Actually need him to be &gt; 2 to make life really easy and have no more trade-offs
@Curious_Chak @D_Blanchflower The average deficit in that period was 1.6% of GDP (about the same as today)
@rad_econ No idea when OECD said that. (probably didn't) but yes, that sort of multiplier is not remotely feasible. 		If it was, everyone would do it. There simply wouldn't be a debate about it
@Curious_Chak @D_Blanchflower The potential rise in NGDP relative to the budget deficits.		Do the maths
@Curious_Chak @D_Blanchflower Simply not enough, given the numerator to be said to be the cause of increased debt/GDP.
@D_Blanchflower That the rise in the debt burden came from 10% deficit to GDP rates not especially low growth in the denominator. 		It was a numerator thing....

@smartasacarrot @t0nyyates @EdConwaySky @FinancialTimes You've misunderstood. You are running an equivalent of first past the post here. 		If all of your chequers and WTO prefer the other over remain, remain would lost both head to head contests. In the count the second Vs third preferences matter as much as first Vs second.
@Chr1sGould @FinancialTimes Yes, and as in your percentages R wins on both head-to-heads it is the clear preference		No difference here to FPTP, but the second place changes with M&gt;ND
@smartasacarrot @t0nyyates @EdConwaySky @FinancialTimes Intention is precisely not to split the leave vote. If a majority leave vote beats remain on both remain Vs no deal and remain Vs May's deal, remain is dead in the water.		This is the way that doesn't split any vote

@neiljeffares @FinancialTimes That might be true and would ensure the public get crosser and crosser about the lack of legitimacy about what is presented to them
@Chr1sGould @FinancialTimes That's precisely why I suggest a Condorcet method rather than a sequential method. 		The clever stuff is in the counting, not in the preferences and far far less opportunity for tactical voting. It helps the "compromise" second choice solution
@Anselmus @FinancialTimes Yes - I think so. With 2, there will be endless arguments about the dropped choice along exactly the lines we were debating earlier. 		It would be a nightmare
@jamest2xu @FinancialTimes Yes - that is where there is no Condorcet winner - the rock, paper, scissors cycle I mentioned. If that is the case, there is no perfect choice and you have to pre-select another method to resolve things

@ONS So the real story is that hourly pay stagnated in 2018. 		Find that in the ONS release. I challenge you

@bruceboughton True!
@JElishevitz @FinancialTimes That has the advantage of simplicity and the disadvantage of less legitimacy		Always trade offs. I see your point but weight legitimacy slightly higher
@Ethnotweeter @FinancialTimes They only have to mark their preferences. 1, 2, or 3. The clever stuff comes in the counting
@BobbyBamber @FinancialTimes Yes - that would be reasonable. Many would say that is akin to not leaving though.
@Anselmus @FinancialTimes Why?
@medicalpoke @FinancialTimes What about the people who say May's deal is so bad, that it would be better to remain rather than have that. 		These preferences, pretty prevalent ones, are disenfranchised in this. 		Remain was only tested against unicorns, not realistic options
@bruceboughton I agree that is the crucial test. I worry about a lack of perceived legitimacy if no deal is rejected as a plausible option. It is feasible, for sure. Stupid, but feasible
@FinancialTimes What is certain is that if the prime minister refuses any vote, or tries to ram her deal through Parliament against a token no deal,		she doesn't care about the will of the people or the will of Parliament. 		That would be a disgrace
@FinancialTimes #PeoplesVote advocates might reasonably say, why not just run Remain Vs May's deal?		I'd say because it lacks the third plausible option and therefore legitimacy
@FinancialTimes My bet is that 	Remain BEATS no deal	May's deal BEATS no deal		No deal is a condorcet loser, I reckon		But I'm not willing to call Remain Vs May's deal		That is the crucial vote
@FinancialTimes All options on the ballot must be feasible. No unicorns.		Seems there are 3: no deal, May's deal and Remain.		Use a preference based voting system. But count the results pitting each against one other in 3 head-to-head contests		This is known as a Condorcet method
@FinancialTimes This doesn't mean there is a cyclical voting preferences like rock, paper, scissors, but we should find out for the result to have legitimacy (so it should go back to the people, not parliament)
@FinancialTimes We can be sure that all of the three realistic outcomes are disliked by the majority	- Remain lost in 2016	- May's deal has few advocates	- No deal has probably fewer

@JoMicheII Britain does badly on all of the measures used by the IMF. The trends match UK studies. 		I have reported the Fiscal Monitor accurately. If you think the results are irrelevant, best explain why rather than attack the messenger
@JoMicheII Yes - tax more.		No mention of austerity. This is hardly a controversial statement. 		There is an issue of pension discounting. But that is the IMF's role in surveillance, to make reasonable comparisons. I reported their work as the best international comparison there is.
@JoMicheII Future tax revenues are not inclluded. 		Which is - er - the point. The weak balance sheet has the implication that more use of taxation will be needed. That is what the article stated. The word austerity was not used once. https://t.co/4wmmZ2R1ol

@TomKibasi Yes - so this is a discretionary spending comparison. Obviously Londoners have huge housing costs and that means they have less than the average for everything else

So much of the reporting - eg this BBC report - is inaccurate		Headline should be "Migration rules should take other trade issues into account, says report" https://t.co/HgbL6Cjzrn
A non-preferential system for EEA migrants has costs to Britain compared with today. 		1) Restrictions on movement for British citizens. Think Aufwiedersehen Pet. No longer possible. 		2) Loss of trade access to the single market that will not exist without free movement
Seb is on the money here.		The economics is obvious. There is no intrinsic advantage to an EEA migrant over a non-EEA migrant. Both offer more benefits than costs to UK economy		BUT... https://t.co/xtHn3B0yV2

@graceblakeley Precisely wrong. It's because of the depreciations that UK wages have stagnated in Britain as nowhere else.

@andyrome64 @ONS You're right, there are very strong age and education correlations. I haven't done this before (and I don't think anyone has done this with local authority data before), so it is nevertheless interesting
@cheianov @ONS I know this is a single correlation. It's still striking though. You have to have some very powerful alternative features to make this correlation disappear in any multivariate analysis
@in_confidential @ONS Would look very similar as earnings and wealth are substantially correlated
@PaulDBrant @ONS True, but the inequality and voting patterns are not defined by LA either, so it's best to think of this as a local area
@LaurenceThinks @ONS Think this must be part of it

@cjsnowdon @ONS I agree with a nuanced version of this.		Ken &amp; Chelsea (Top inequality) not been a bastion of stability in the past year.		This data suggests most Scandinavian part is Blaenau Gwent

@AllieRenison @GeorgePeretzQC @jackschickler EC can withdraw from agreements - or not sign them		It's not powerless at all
@JudithFreedman @jeremydcape @jillongovt Seems a very well-argued piece (at least from the abstract!)
@GeorgePeretzQC @jackschickler The incentive is for selective tax breaks which distort heavily in certain sectors (think film, for example). 		Having CMA police this is a non-starter both for HMG/Parliament and EC (for different reasons)
@GeorgePeretzQC @jackschickler The economics of tax competition depend crucially on the size of the jurisdiction and the domestic revenue at stake. 		That's why Ireland can do low CT rates but UK finds it much more painful.
@GeorgePeretzQC @jackschickler I agree with that. It is much more likely to be hard to define distortionary tax breaks, which I agree, the CMA could not remotely police.		Commission can and does, even in big cases such as Apple/Ireland
@jillongovt @JudithFreedman Overseen by the CMA?		I wouldn't want to be the CMA, refusing to allow the Treasury to implement a tax wheeze.		If I was the EUCO, I wouldn't agree to it
@jillongovt @JudithFreedman Luckily, we're too big to do classic tax haven stuff on rates. But discretionary tax treatments of various sectors?...		the EUCO are worried and will not give us what we want without safeguards

Even after being corrected that clothing on RPI has not been addressed, @trussliz says again it has been addressed.		I wish she was correct, but she is wrong

@TomPurvis_TP @Liztruss It's the Lords Economic Affairs Committee asking the question (not my preferred one) whether moving to a measure of CPI inflation 1pp lower a year would save £4bn 		The answer is obviously yes 		But  you should reform RPI, not switch to CPI
@Liztruss These are the people running the public finances. 		And this is how much they care about your money. They prefer to defend an indefensible index because it might cause some problems to improve it. And they want to spend your money to fund their laziness

@jillongovt @FinancialTimes @gemmatetlow Clearly. But lots of domestic service companies serve others that do trade so perhaps the whole concept is silly and 80% of VA is a relevant number.
@jillongovt @FinancialTimes @gemmatetlow If goods are 10% of econ and produce 60% of exports to EU, a figure such as 8% would seem a fair guess.		But if goods is much more concentrated in exporting, then a higher number well over 10% is appropriate.

@ObiWanCorbyni It’s *probably* about the same. ONS says 8,000 in fishing. Harrods accounts say a yearly average of 4,200. But that does not include the concessions inside Harrods which account for half of sales, so you can *probably* double the average number.
@thomasforth Probably true. Since my poor 1990s prorgamming still probably has traces in the IFS code, I’ll take the blame
It’s an industry of the past https://t.co/6LdMYH9Nrw
@PickardJE Actually. We need to be careful. 		These are not strictly comparable. Concessions in Harrods make a GVA figure impossible. It is definitely &gt;400m and probably &lt;1,000m		A private company, Harrods didn’t want to detail its in house concessions business. Understandable
@christiancalgie No. It’s an obviously absurd comparison to make a point. What do you think fishing contributes to the Grimsby (local authority) economy if you want a non-London take?		Well, the whole of agriculture including fishing is only 1.6%
@thomasforth Dunno what IFS playing at. Std regions is the data.
@DMcWilliams_UK I did. Harrods is difficult as the accounts show. 		It has £2bn sales. Many of those are in concessions in store.		The business itself has operating profits and wage costs of £400m from a turnover of £900m. 		Hence the “almost certainly” for the business including concessions

@nicktolhurst @TheIFS You are caught in the one bit of the income distribution that has changed significantly. The intergenerational picture. 		It’s not a rich poor thing, but an old young thing. I agree
@themattmyth @TonysAngle @TheIFS There is no wealth in this report. But it is nonetheless true. Was just heading off the std (yeah, that’s income, what about wealth response)
@_Financeguy @t0nyyates @toby_n @bankofengland True. He does give that impression. But it’s never in MOC toolkit
@MattPattv1 Quite possibly. 		My untested hypothesis is that because income growth for all has been so terrible, we like to look for scapegoats, rather an accept it’s been a bit rubbish for all
@dsquareddigest @kensheets @bankofengland Yes. I agree that’s probably right. Totally immune from mon pol
@duncanhames @TheIFS Yup
@MacroMarshall @TheIFS This is the same data as the DWP figures.
If ONLY we could agree these facts		It’s not asking much, is it?

@fatdaz @simon_r_johnson @katie_martin_fx @bankofengland No
@JohnRentoul @TheIFS It’s because poverty is  measured against the 2010/11 relative line, not the contemporary equivalent. 		You fix a line once and then compare real incomes against that fixed line

@toby_n @bankofengland Yes. BoE thinks it does everything perfectly (see its QE paper for example) so it already maximises mon pol productivity contribution

@Rep_rehensible @axelheitmueller I agree in principle. But we’re talking numbers journalism. My one test is that it must be true and fair.

@axelheitmueller @Rep_rehensible Zero real. GDP Deflator.
@Rep_rehensible @axelheitmueller Yes. Fair. But as a simplification, this is a reasonable comparator
@Sime0nStylites That is true
@DanielPearson27 That depends on your view of NHS needs vs tax and borrowing consequences. 		Health foundation and IFS estimated recently 3.4% stops NHS deterioration. 4+ allows improvement.

If we do nothing and have a leaky border, put yourself in Amazon’s shoes. 		Where would you build the next U.K. distribution warehouse. 		Yes. Calais.
Some officials say that once U.K. decides to be in the EU customs union and has goods alignment, it is a small extra step to seek to remain in the VAT union. 		Notice: that is	a) not government policy	b) requires information sharing which is not currently on offer
Both have had their fraud problems already, particularly in parcels (non EU) and carousel fraud (EU)		The fraud undermines legitimate business and can put retailers out of business. 		But we don’t have a coherent plan for Brexit
VAT on goods exempts exports and charges imports. 		To avoid fraud where untaxed goods circulate freely, you’ve got to know when they cross borders. 		1) Non EU: we check the containers/parcels 		2) EU: we use a paper trail 		1 requires infrastructure 	2 requires EU consent
We need to talk about VAT, borders and Brexit. 		 Being inside the customs union, solving regulatory alignment doesn’t solve this border problem		The choice is infrastructure, ECJ (and EU consent) or massive fraud		https://t.co/PmqsjpgcX7 via @financialtimes

@julianHjessop @GrantLewis1 It depends on the consignment. For a parcel, which I have done work on, receiver pays at least £8 (slow mail) and around £15 (fast parcel). 		There are a lot of them. 		Sender has the customers declaration costs on top. 		Total friction of £30 seems a decent number.

@FraserNelson @Legal_Cynic17 @spectator Yes - all the time. We constantly badgered the BoE about they crappy wage forecasts. 		And that is why I don't use income, and don't endorse the £900 number. GDP is the best measure here, where previous BoE forecasts were not too rosy
@TeraPauliina @FinancialTimes Absolutely correct. The "puzzle" was number 3 though. And that's why explanations for it using long tail are wrong
@FraserNelson @Legal_Cynic17 @spectator Come on Fraser, the article doesn't do that at all. It also makes no adjustment for the improved global environment, which should have boosted UK performance but didn't. 		The article suggests, contrary to the facts, that the UK economy has performed better than expected
@Legal_Cynic17 @FraserNelson @spectator So it is amusing that they now say a big sterling fall was inevitable. Revisionism has no bounds...
@Legal_Cynic17 @FraserNelson @spectator The £900 number is perfectly valid, but I prefer GDP numbers (if people smooth spending through an income squeeze, I think that should be taken into account).		No one was forecasting sterling falling - certainly not Fraser and Brexiters before the #EURef,
@Legal_Cynic17 @FraserNelson @spectator With caveats, it's perfectly reasonable to think of counter factuals and compare reality with them. If Fraser thinks this is invalid, he should think again. 		Clearly income estimates will be higher than GDP estimates because, er, the Brexit vote squeezed incomes

"We think we can manage the risk - we think we can" he said. He didn't sound so sure. 		And "the potential backdoor risk applies to both models" he added		Didn't sound like officials think either is sensible
Both would not be ready by 2021. Max Fac needs 3 years. Customs Partnership requires 5, Mr Thompson said.		The border would be "functioning", but if technology not ready ministers would need to trade off their objectives of "free flow, revenue and security".		Leaky borders
Mr Thompson said he did not expect the EU to reciprocate over the customs partnership. 		What that means is UK collects tariffs for EU and hands it over when a ship lands in Felixtowe and drives to Calais, but if ship first lands in Rotterdam, EU keeps the import tariffs.
Theresa May's New Customs Partnership is much cheaper for business (almost zero cost)  because it seeks to replicate today's arrangements but is thought to be "cretinous" by brexiters and "magical thinking" by the EU27...		...and
How does he arrive at the figure		200m export consignments at an average cost of £32.50 each = £6.5bn (times two because two way traffic)		plus around £4 to £7bn of rules of origin compliance from filling in other forms
The Brexiter favourite Max Fac - would cost business between £17 and £20bn a year		- that's almost 1% of GDP		- just for filling in forms		Thanks #Brexit

Though the headline isn’t a fair reflection of the piece. https://t.co/mceIOaDHuJ
@t0nyyates The final step I think is to condition the forecast in the expected rate path. That’s where the confusion is. 		Carney says look at the data, but listening to the MPC and understanding, for example, that the BBC interview was a deliberate choice &gt; data.
@t0nyyates Yes. Better than one ball at a time, but now muddled, so needs someone Keese to complete the job. Press relations better. Policy has been fine. No major mistakes. What more could you want.
Carney’s poor communication is a wonderful legacy to a successor. 		An obvious job to do		Don’t think you can blame Carney for UK economy post Brexit. And BoE procedures are generally much much improved. Transformed even.

@8inkcartridges They would. But they are cheaper - so (and this is just a theory) you get both a big repayment and not a huge drop in new lending
@JoMicheII Oh, we seem to be slightly at cross purposes here. 		I have been long on the record saying I think there is a big problem in undergrad courses in the UK - too mathsy, all the incentives on staff to do research not teach. etc etc		That is different from economics as a profession
Or maybe it's nothing to do with owning/renting cars, as some in the industry sa, because finance for 2nd hand cars is growing strongly still. (as is that market)
@JoMicheII between that and....

@Resjudicatamyft @JolyonMaugham @StevePeers Because the short term was not a question economics is good at answering. The -0.1 for 4 Qs is strong circumstantial evidence of a requirement for &lt;0 answer. And some private conversations I have had, led me to that view
@domwalsh1973 @IncompetentMay @stephen_wigmore @make_trouble Yes - I think that is about fair
@fascinatorfun @JolyonMaugham @StevePeers All that is true - but in the May 2016 HMT paper, the 3 drivers of the sharp downturn were 	a) transition effect (not A50 related), 	b) uncertainty effect (A50 intensifies but there without)	c) financial conditions effect (A50 arguably important)
@mrjamesob It's as good as any economist. The question now is threefold: the degree to which real pay growth rises, whether people save any extra money, and whether companies are more or less fearful of Brexit...
@JolyonMaugham @StevePeers That said, we'd probably be near the cliff edge now, had we invoked in June 2016...

@t0nyyates Good point, well made
@neiljeffares Yes - that was the point I was making
So, here is a challenge for @ONS and @UKStatsAuth . Don't let @bankofengland run rings round you. Do some analysis of your own decisions. 		It might help make better ones in future....

Even better. How about a study of the distributional effects of not changing the RPI in 2013?		Here is a starter. Look at the price of index linked bonds of different maturities around the time of the decision compared with a conventional gilt https://t.co/p73xWOCqqU
Hey, look @ONS and @UKStatsAuth . Other independent institutions are taking seriously questions of their policy and distribution. 		Why not follow suit and analyse the distributional consequences of the 2010 change in clothing price collection and its impact on the RPI? https://t.co/cIgHfH6A9w
So normal communication on the effectiveness of monetary policy is most important. 		And this sort of distributional work is difficult and excellent as a supplement		/ends
I worry this smacks of propaganda because it's clear to people if you assume your policy makes everyone better off, a personal letter saying "hey look, you're better off" is not very powerful
Which brings the @bankofengland back to the start - it must persuade the public that monetary policy has an aggregate benefit and that it is in the nation's interest		Andy suggests a personal letter from the BoE telling you how wonderful the BoE is at making you better off
The pattern is very similar to the perception of monetary policy impact the public gives (but the public are gloomy about it, thinking there are no gains) https://t.co/G4qCJqRKIl
The interesting wrinkle is that the @bankofengland goes further than money and tries to look at the value of income, wealth and jobs for people (unemployment has a huge negative effect on welfare), so when it does this. EVERYONE IS HAPPY - (there are still a few old losers) https://t.co/qgpr3yJzz3
Here is the wealth chart by age https://t.co/Cs0w8MvqI5
And the losers are more obvious in an age distribution		Older people lost income (gained wealth) https://t.co/bcpbRlKEBu
That said, there a lot of some losers in income terms at the bottom of the distribution, who no longer received decent savings interest https://t.co/lCsHxi0yfQ
This means it's hard for any results to show losses - whether BoE raises or lowers rates - its assumption is that this was done for the good of the country, so there will always be few losers in its distributional analysis		THIS POINT MUST NEVER BE FORGOTTEN
@bankofengland This does not explain the effect of policy, which was to hit savers and bring forward spending.		BoE counterfactual says the world would have  been much worse without the loosening. https://t.co/BZ1xmZVCTY
@bankofengland The overall stability of the income and wealth distributions, he adds gives some reassurance the policy did not massively increase inequality, but... https://t.co/E0yeUkFB8n

5) the Times and Guardian news judgments were fine, IMO, because the data was a mixed bag. We chose differently		Obvs. Ross could have asked or looked at the data carefully before whinging about others. 		He made his choice. It was not to bother
So we led on investment, but put it in a proper context. As we always try to do. 	4) Ross would have preferred us to have no context and add in FDI figures that weren’t new (or particularly good recently, but he would want us to ignore that)
3) clearly to us, the freshest line was the surprising relative (not absolute) strength of total (not business) investment	4) but writing about boom boom Britain story would have been absurd given the totality of the data and knowledge that many construction projects are ending
So let me tell you the news judgment process yesterday. 	1) There was far too much @ons  data released. Much we knew. The rest was a mixed bag. Weak consumption, weak business investment, stronger trade, lowest savings rate ever	2) what is the top line? We asked ourselves.

@JackLSimpson @FinancialTimes Show me some convincing data and I’m happy to consider it. But don’t just go on a search for figures that support the argument. 		I think it is always more fruitful to consider whether your objective needs “rising inequality” as a justification. Often, it doesn’t

@dsquareddigest True, dat
@MrRBourne @FinancialTimes It's a point that cannot be repeated often enough though
@MrRBourne @FinancialTimes Soz!
@sjwrenlewis Surely the best response to the lack of trust is not for some economists to say "we're not like the other lot, we're much better".		Rather, for everyone to be clear about the value of forecasting  - applying existing knowledge to give the best view of something unknown.
@TorstenBell Both fair points
@dlknowles True, but they have to win and that requires women's support and that of men who are a little more balanced....		I think the evidence points more strongly to a lack of income growth, because we've had rising male inequality for a long time without populism
@TorstenBell I've been wondering about your wealth Vs taxes chart. Isn't this in many ways unsurprising and not showing wealth under-taxes, but just that revenue lags horribly because UK wealth taxes are transaction based (death, sale or both)?
@dlknowles I had two (male) academics bang on at me about this, this week. David Autor says this a lot too		Maybe true. Hard to tell. If you shove it in a regression, it is likely to "be important", but the argument that women's experiences don't matter strikes me as a little 1950s

@adamcorlett Now - little income growth anywhere in the distribution - everyone up in arms. 		To me this suggests income growth dominates how people feel about inequality (not absolute or relative)		But that is just a hypothesis

@JohnRalfe1 @neiljeffares @ONS Sorry for confusing - I was not talking specifically or contractually.

That's why we need to reform RPI - so it does what everyone would like it to do and thought it used to
@AnnPettifor @MattWhittakerRF @FerdiGiugliano @ONS But UK here is an outlier - where, if I am not mistaken it is recorded to have risen a touch
@neiljeffares @ONS No. Me neither
@neiljeffares @ONS !!		These contractual questions, which are entirely fair, have persuaded me the right thing to do is sort out RPI itself rather than trying switches to CPI.
@neiljeffares @ONS BT showed it was very specific to the individual pension scheme
@neiljeffares @ONS Clearly - it will link to something specific, but the purpose would be inflation protection. Not: inflation protection + whatever Carli happens to give you depending on the particular way the ONS decides to measure clothing prices and other goods and which happens no where else
@neiljeffares @ONS Less for sure. Not necessarily less than they were promised. They were promised inflation protection and that is what they'll get. They will no longer get inflation+

@fraser_slater1 The owner-occupation boom+house price rising feature of the last 30 years kept it steady.		It also contains the seeds of future rises in inequality if wealth is transmitted down generations unequally (likely)
There is a good chance that inequality will start rising  - benefit cuts &amp; concentration of wealth from inheritances - but it has not happened yet

@jwestjourno We don't have as good, nor consistent, data over the same period. From the data which does exist, it looks flatish too. The reason being that housing wealth is widespread and was relatively evenly distributed. 		In future this will not hold, but to date it has more or less
@AvidInquirer I genuinely don't think people do. Wealth inequality in the UK has been terrible stable too. 		All the action has been in intergenerational income and wealth distributions. And that's not what people mean when they talk about inequality. 		They use other language. Correctly

@dthroat CPI does not have a ludicrous formula at its heart. The ONS household costs experimental index is close to CPI. Owner occupied housing is certainly an issue, but it is dwarfed by RPI problems. 		And little is indexed to CPI, so it doesn't redistribute like RPI does. That's why

@cjsnowdon @jdportes I think I can adjudicate. If ihe result hinges on a legitimate question of policy shift, it is invalidated.
@cjsnowdon @jdportes My view on a fair "sticking to the cuts" assumption is that a nominal rise in benefits would count as "sticking to the cuts" so long as the implied real cut was not diluted.		If the specific inflation measure to be used matters, CPI Vs expected CPI dominates		Fair?
@jdportes @cjsnowdon Sure. This is also quite a bet on inflation.		Hope @bankofengland are noticing. Money bet publicly on their inflation credentials.
@cjsnowdon @jdportes So, a faster rise than in the 2nd half of the 1980s. 		Haven't considered the probabilities much. But if it happens, that will be noticed. 		It was in the 1980s (and then we had rapid income growth)

@EdConwaySky @billwells_1 @dsmitheconomics @rbrharrison @edconway @Gilesyb I agree there is a big question over the output gap assumption - OBR looks v pessimistic to me. 		Not so sure about estate agent/ retail productivity. These do not contribute to the drop in overall productivity growth any more. That was only a 2010/2011 thing
@EdConwaySky @billwells_1 @dsmitheconomics @rbrharrison Likewise,	I agree there is statistical fog, but OBR exaggerated it, but choosing the measure that made the fog densest.		Wasn't the measure that gave the real view of the smogginess of the fog. 		That's enough fog metaphors
@billwells_1 @EdConwaySky @dsmitheconomics @rbrharrison @edconway And we are allocating more jobs to lower productivity sectors in the past year or so - likely to continue with aging.		Now, perhaps you and I might get disrupted by 10 robots writing more econ columns....		...poor, poor readers....
@billwells_1 @EdConwaySky @dsmitheconomics @rbrharrison @edconway Utilities has got more labour intensive (renewables just are, apparently)	Banking needs more regulation and the world thinks we're not as brilliant as it thought in 2007	Prof services- the industry bodies say, had a one-off internationalisation in 1990s-2000s.
@billwells_1 @EdConwaySky @dsmitheconomics @rbrharrison @edconway I don't think I agree on services likely to bounce back. (leave telecoms out of this as its clearly measured wrong). The productivity decline is concentrated in banking, utilities, prof services and, recently, an allocation effect....
@EdConwaySky @billwells_1 @dsmitheconomics @rbrharrison But you would accept that the past data doesn't really stack up? It's a 2016 thing?		I went down the same route for quite some hours on Weds before thinking it was all a waste of time
@billwells_1 @EdConwaySky @dsmitheconomics @rbrharrison I don't disagree that the future might be brighter, but to base that on an argument that the stats say the past was also brighter is simply wrong, coz it wasn't in 2017 		(2016 is proper weird, but we knew that)
@EdConwaySky @OBR_UK All this could be wrong and the future bright, but I think the @OBR_UK got a bit excited and carried away with its chart. 		Coz - and this matters		BRITAIN STILL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE G7 LEAGUE TABLE IN Q4 YOY AND GROWTH HAS SLOWED ON WHATEVER MEASURE CHOSEN
@EdConwaySky @OBR_UK In 2017, all three measures of GDP showed slow quarterly growth 		(the annual 2017 figure is infected with a lot of data from 2016 - I won't go there)		The ONS in choosing its "headline" measure has also gone with the higher estimates,  not average and it has ignored incomes
@EdConwaySky @OBR_UK But if you take a closer look at the quarterly pattern of these numbers, much of the mystery and the suggestions all is fine disappears (look at the bottom right) https://t.co/mYXMTTAYVP

@neiljeffares @ESCoEorg I support that. I'm not in favour of a "low" rate.

@simonbriscoe @ONS @Roborovski1 @RichardDisney @billwells_1 Yes. That’s my point. Par 207 says it’s all geo@erric Vs Arithmetic. It isn’t. Arithmetic means do not automatically give a higher number, as CPAC found. So the 1990s view was wrong. Plain wrong. 		That took months to discover and the judge misunderstood.
@simonbriscoe @ONS @RoyalStatSoc @billwells_1 @Roborovski1 @RichardDisney Funny that. I thought it borderline illegal.  There is a legal duty to more than that on RPI

@billwells_1 @Roborovski1 @simonbriscoe @PJTheEconomist can't do that until ONS changes policy - otherwise I would agree. Choose "right" way - and change the RPI to be that index. It is the only way to go since the law prevents other routes being successful
@billwells_1 @Roborovski1 @simonbriscoe @PJTheEconomist So the thing that has to change first is the ridiculous @ONS 2013 decision never to make substantive changes to the RPI, subsequently and shamefully endorsed by @UKStatsAuth
@billwells_1 @Roborovski1 @simonbriscoe @PJTheEconomist Sadly it is not a branding issue as the 2007 Act specifically mentions the retail price index and literally no other statistic
@Roborovski1 @billwells_1 @simonbriscoe @PJTheEconomist There is some truth in that. The law doesn't help though. It places RPI above all else in primary legislation, which means, I think, that the RPI has to be the index which is regarded as "best" and the main national measure
@Roborovski1 This is not just my memory from being on CPAC. Look at the contemporary minutes - not perfect but show the voyage of discovery by all, including @ONS 		https://t.co/ZS2erDcozB
@Roborovski1 That was what was weird. It was a surprise to everyone. ONS officials thought RPI used "arithmetic" but not which sort. 	Spent months down blind alleys thinking about which index gave "correct" elasticity of substitution.	In 2012, it dawned that this was just a price bounce issue
Before we all start agreeing, Simon, you were also hauled over the coals by the judge for misrepresenting one of my articles (Par 125) and had "some difficulty in recognising it". 		But yes - 2 inquiries would be fine and better than @ONS proposal just to look a clothing again https://t.co/u90cKw7H0q
@RichardDisney @simonbriscoe I don't just say "no". I say,  "go and look at the CPAC minutes for 2011 and search for Carli - you won't find it". 		https://t.co/ZS2erDcozB		The first mention is in Feb or April 2012 when the penny dropped. And the Sept minutes when we realised this wasn't a geo Vs arith thing
@Roborovski1 What wasn't known was that the RPI used Carli. Took CPAC a year to find out in 2011, that no one else used it was also not known and this was seen as pretty shocking		Previously, the thinking had been arithmetic Vs geometric (which doesn't create a difference necessarily)
@StrongerInNos @rolandmcs @FinancialTimes @hmtreasury Yes - not a high point
And, most importantly, 	3 ) Judge ruled solely in the context of BT pension scheme rules. 		Par 205. The test, "is not whether RPI is inappropriate,generally speaking, as a measure of inflation"		So, no, the judgment changes nothing.		Let's have a Parliamentary Inquiry
With the greatest respect	1) Judgment is subject to an appeal	2) Judge made (IMHO) serious factual errors in thinking Carli error was known in 2002 - it wasn't known in 2011! I will happily provide a witness statement... https://t.co/YrgeHApwny
