In the interim, we would like to hear from Secretary Wilkie about what can be done to expeditiously get these critical, life-saving outreach efforts back on track so veterans in need of help are not being lost in the suicide crisis.”
—including the roles of undersecretary for health and principal deputy undersecretary for health—that must be permanently filled in order to allow for comprehensive vision and strategy to be executed throughout the department.
One of the major problems that has led to this failure, and others across the board, is the persistence of vacancies in VA’s key leadership positions. There are currently a large number of high-level VA positions being filled by acting directors
but they are rendered useless in actually preventing suicide if veterans and family members don’t know they exist or are unable to access them.
Outreach is absolutely critical to the success of suicide prevention efforts and—as this is VA’s top clinical priority—we would expect much closer oversight to ensure the funds are being properly directed to effective campaign strategies. VA offers great mental health programs,
“We are extremely disappointed by VA’s mismanagement of funding for such an important program in the face of a suicide crisis among veterans.

We call on @SenatorEnzi &amp; @SenMikeLee to listen to the overwhelming majority of their colleagues in the Senate, together with the unanimous bipartisan support in the House, and finally do the right thing for the remaining #BlueWaterNavy veterans who have served and suffered.
So contrary to what Senators @SenatorEnzi and @SenMikeLee – and the @DeptVetAffairs – have implied, VA’s decision to EXCLUDE #BlueWaterNavy veterans was NOT based on scientific evidence.
And this law was based on sound scientific evidence.	 	For example, in 1990, the Centers for Disease Control found that Vietnam veterans who served on ships were MORE likely to develop Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma – which is linked to Agent Orange – than veterans who served on land.
So when the Agent Orange Act of 1991 was passed, ALL 2.7 million veterans who served in Vietnam – including ALL who served off the shores of Vietnam – were presumed to have been exposed to Agent Orange based on receipt of the Vietnam Service Medal.
Like all 2.7 million men and women who served in Vietnam, “Blue Water Navy” veterans answered the call of their nation, put themselves in harm’s way, and tragically many of them became sick or died from cancers and other illnesses caused by their exposure to #AgentOrange.
...were blocked by a single Senator. Unfortunately, as a result of the opposition from @SenatorEnzi of Wyoming, as well as @SenMikeLee of Utah, tens of thousands of aging, ill &amp; dying Vietnam #veterans must continue waiting to receive the recognition, benefits &amp; care they earned.

"Those of us who have served understand the need fellow #veterans have to be a part of something bigger than yourself—to have a mission to fulfill that calling.”	-Newly elected @DAVHQ National Commander Dennis Nixon, a combat-wounded #Vietnam #veteran
After several months of hospitalization, one of his legs was amputated. 		"All I could ever imagine in 1969 was being a United States Marine," said Nixon. "But after #Vietnam I had to learn to walk again and face a new life."
Nixon enlisted at the age of 17 in 1964. While on his 2nd combat tour in #Vietnam, he stepped on a landmine and suffered severe injuries, requiring eight surgeries.

We applaud the House passage of the #BlueWaterNavy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2017! We call on the Senate to pass the same legislation and get this bill into law. -@Garry_Augustine https://t.co/rBSXGsLxGv
"After an overwhelming bipartisan vote in the #House, we now call on the #Senate to take similar action on the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act so that it can be sent to @POTUS and finally signed into law this year."
"H.R. 299 would correct this injustice by providing #BlueWaterNavy veterans the same presumption of exposure to Agent Orange that already exists in the law for those who served in country.
"...and other herbicides, but they haven’t been given the same presumption of service connection for Agent Orange related illnesses as their fellow veterans who served on the ground in Vietnam.
"This legislation would right a long overdue wrong for thousands of veterans who served on ships during the Vietnam War and later became ill from their service. Approximately 90,000 @USNavy veterans who served off the shores of Vietnam were potentially exposed to #AgentOrange.
From @DAVHQ Washington HQ Exec. Dir. @Garry_Augustine: "On behalf of DAV’s more than 1 million members, I applaud today’s #House approval of H.R. 299, the #BlueWaterNavy #Vietnam #Veterans Act of 2017." https://t.co/RrHoEQXxre

Thank you for taking the time to recognize how important this is. God bless you all, God bless our #veterans and God bless the United States of America. #VeteransCreed
The #VeteransCreed unites us in a way only those of us who served can understand, and shows our fellow Americans the ethos that make #veterans a critical asset to the nation long after our time in uniform is complete.
It means I will remember my comrades who made the ultimate sacrifice, and never made it home. My fellow #veterans inspire me each and every day. They refuse to back down from challenges. They recognize that life may be different—but it is certainly not over.
It means I will dedicate my life to ensuring #veterans—from all eras and all walks of life—will know they have a family in the #veteran community. And I will fight for them to lead lives of respect and dignity.
The first line: I am an American #veteran.		What does that mean to you? To me, it means the values I learned while in the #military—integrity, leadership, teamwork—are ingrained in me to my core.
I know many of you have similar stories of service, sacrifice and loss. The point is, #veterans don’t have to walk that road alone, and that’s what we’re reminded of when we see the #VeteransCreed.
My life had been changed forever. After 18 months at @WRBethesda, I left the #military and re-entered civilian life a much different person than when I left to join the @USArmy.
It is meant to inspire #veterans to continue to serve and lead in their communities and our country, and to continue to make a difference in our world. I myself returned from my combat tour in #Vietnam severely wounded and unsure of my future at the tender age of 19.
Those feelings are only magnified when a #veteran struggles to find their new place in the world. This is why 11 major #VSOs—including @DAVHQ—collaborated and developed the #VeteransCreed.
From @DAVHQ's @Garry_Augustine: One of the most significant challenges service members face when leaving active duty, is the loss of that #military cohesiveness they become accustomed to. The transition into the civilian world can leave many #veterans feeling lonely and hopeless. https://t.co/7SZ6fVqiA4

My late husband Jimmy—a fellow disabled #veteran—and I were unable to receive these critical caregiver benefits. But with today’s signing of the #VAMISSIONAct, we are now one step closer to ensuring no #veteran or #caregiver will be left behind again.
For years, @DAVHQ has fiercely advocated for an expansion of these life-changing benefits and services that too many of our nation’s heroes were ineligible for due to an arbitrary date.
This new law will not only extend support to thousands more deserving family #caregivers that severely injured #veterans rely on, but also make a number of reforms and improvements to strengthen the @VeteransHealth care system and improve veterans’ access to care.
As National Commander of @DAVHQ, a proud #veteran and a former family #caregiver, I am grateful for leaders in the House, Senate and the Administration coming together to enact the #VAMISSIONAct.

@SenatorIsakson @DeptVetAffairs Thank you for your leadership, Chairman!
As our nation prepares for solemn remembrances over the #MemorialDay weekend, the best way to honor fallen #heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice is by ensuring that all surviving #veterans and families get the benefits and care they have earned.
The House and Senate have done their job and we now look to the President to sign this historic legislation.
This groundbreaking legislation will not only support America’s unsung heroes—family caregivers—but also make a number of reforms and improvements to strengthen the VA health care system and expand access for all enrolled veterans.
On behalf of DAV, our Auxiliary and our more than one million members, I applaud the 92 Senators who voted for veterans today by passing the #VAMISSIONAct.
In an overwhelming 92-5 vote the Senate has passed the #VAMISSIONAct! DAV applauds the passage of this historic veterans legislation. Read the statement from DAV National Commander Delphine Metcalf-@FosterDelphine here: https://t.co/cVeBV50lLj

In a statement, @DAVHQ National Commander @FosterDelphine said the #VAMISSIONAct "marks a major milestone in attaining greater fairness for seriously injured #veterans of all eras who need and rely on family #caregivers."
@Garry_Augustine added that home care averages less than $30,000 annually, while hospital care would amount to about $400,000 a year.
Extending #caregivers assistance to disabled #veterans of all eras is "the right thing to do" and would also limit costs by allowing disabled vets to remain at home, rather than be hospitalized.

So today, we are calling on all Senators to stand with America’s #veterans and their family #caregivers by voting for the #VAMISSIONAct.		The men and women who served are counting on your support.		Thank you. #KeepThePromise
Let me assure you, as my VSO colleagues will also discuss, we would not be supporting this legislation if we were not convinced that it would expand access to medical care for enrolled #veterans and strengthen the VA health care system that we all support so strongly.
The #VAMISSIONAct will help ease the burden on thousands of American heroes -- as well as #UnsungHeroes – our family #caregivers. Over the past couple of weeks we have seen and heard some very misleading arguments against the #VAMISSIONAct.
With Senate approval of this historic legislation, we can finally extend eligibility to World War II, Korean, Vietnam, and Gulf War era #veterans who need and rely on family #caregivers.
And now -- today -- the Senate can take a huge step to correct this inequity by voting to move forward and vote for #VAMISSIONAct.
And in December, the @VAChair Committee took action, passing the Care in the Community Act -- which in addition to consolidating and reforming @DeptVetAffairs community care programs -- included the #caregiver expansion.
Together with our VSO and stakeholder allies, we delivered almost 200,000 signatures to Congress last fall calling for extending the #caregiver program to #veterans of all eras.
Last June, @DAVHQ launched The #UnsungHeroes Initiative to bring greater attention and focus on the need to fix this vital program through expanded grassroots, social media and Capitol Hill activities. https://t.co/Uk5wFWE0kt
It’s clear that expanding @DeptVetAffairs comprehensive #caregiver program to veterans of all eras is not only the right thing to do for those who served -- it’s also the financially smart decision for America’s taxpayers.
Consider that @DeptVetAffairs estimates the cost of long term care for severely disabled #veterans at up to $400,000 annually -- whereas the average cost in its #caregiver program is under $30,000 per year.
This is not only an unfair policy; it's also a fiscally unsound one. According to a DAV survey conducted last year, 75 percent of veterans who rely on caregivers today would need to be institutionalized, at much greater expense to VA, if they no longer had family supporting them https://t.co/xi6J5fpHcZ
Unfortunately, due to budgetary constraints at the time, Congress limited full #caregiver benefits to #veterans who were injured on or after September 11, 2001 ---- leaving thousands of deserving pre-9/11 #veterans and #caregivers without the support they needed. https://t.co/Y6Ip59Z8lL
For @DAVHQ and our 1 million plus members and @DAVAuxiliary , caregiver expansion has been one of our highest priorities since the program was created back in 2009.
And I want to offer a special thanks to Senators @PattyMurray and @SenatorCollins for championing the caregiver program in the Senate.
I also want to thank the other Senators here today, as well as @HouseVetAffairs Members -- particularly Chairman @DrPhilRoe – for the big bipartisan vote in the House last week. https://t.co/ig5j3BjoHJ
Your tenacious efforts to support all of America’s #veterans – including their family caregivers – has made, and is continuing to make real progress in fulfilling our promises to the men and women who served. https://t.co/RqZHZe1BsG

.@DAVHQ Assistant National Legislative Director @ShaneLiermann is testifying to the @HouseVetAffairs on Economic Opportunity on ways to strengthen @DeptVetAffairs Vocational Rehabilitation programs for ill and injured #veterans. https://t.co/DMDx4QkXfR
Not located in #Wisconsin? No problem. We host career fairs for #veterans across the country—and online, too! Check out the full schedule at https://t.co/4pld9MIHgx. https://t.co/dafpCxnnui
Attention @CityofMilwaukee #veterans, military spouses, transitioning service members and Guard/Reserve personnel: the @DAVHQ/@RecruitMilitary job fair at @MillerPark kicks off in 15 minutes. See you there! @JHa0311 https://t.co/PvOahJ2vwf
The @DAVHQ Mobile Service Office fleet continues to travel cross-country making hundreds of stops, including several college campuses. The full schedule is available at the link. Don't forget, these claim services are free. https://t.co/sTwkUDqE8K
Dietetics major &amp; @USArmyReserve #veteran Betty Gonzalez talked to Countryman about #benefits. “I’ve noticed from my personal experience that there were so many things I was initially misinformed about after getting out. Don’t be afraid to ask questions—as many as you can.” https://t.co/wcJmdF5Pzb
“Too often, #studentveterans don’t know about their benefits beyond the GI Bill—if they even know about that,” said Countryman. “They may not know about Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment, for example, which I have personally benefited from.” https://t.co/ySpaG7Uqc2
.@USNavy #veteran and benefits advocate Raymond Countryman traveled from his office at the @DeptVetAffairs regional office in Los Angeles to 4 stops throughout #California in March aboard a @DAVHQ mobile office. His first destination was @LBCityCollege to assist #studentveterans. https://t.co/jMs274iV6h
In 2017, these mobile service offices visited 665 sites—including 37 college campuses—facilitating 6,335 interviews with #veterans, their families and survivors that resulted in 3,507 claims for #benefits. In total, the fleet covered 56,318 miles.
With more than a million #veterans using education benefits through the @DeptVetAffairs, @DAVHQ has extended its reach of mobile service offices over the past few years to also cover a number of colleges and universities. https://t.co/jpJ2kkeriY

We call on all those who support #veterans, their families and #caregivers to help us fight for passage of the #VAMISSIONAct of 2018 so that @POTUS can sign this legislation before #MemorialDay. Read the full statement from @FosterDelphine at https://t.co/46icUAoPUE
#VAMISSIONAct will not only support America’s #unsungheroes, but also make a number of reforms &amp; improvements to strengthen the @VeteransHealth care system. While we celebrate this bill’s passage in the House, there is still work to be done to ensure it is approved by the Senate.
We applaud @HouseVetAffairs Chairman @DrPhilRoe for his leadership and all representatives who voted in favor of this essential legislation.
@DAVHQ has fiercely advocated for legislation that would correct this inequity, and the #VAMISSIONAct of 2018 would expand the @DeptVetAffairs Comprehensive Family Caregiver Program to #veterans injured in service prior to September 11, 2001.
.@DAVHQ Natl Commander @FosterDelphine released the following statement in response to passage of the #VAMISSIONAct: For too long, many of the #unsungheroes who support the men and women who served and sacrificed for our nation have been left behind based on an arbitrary date.

We certainly expect the next Secretary to continue the path set by @DeptVetAffairs, Congress and #VSOs in recent years to strengthen the @VeteransHealth care system while ensuring that all enrolled #veterans have timely access to quality care, whenever and wherever they need it.
At a time of critical negotiations over the future of @VeteransHealth care reform, @DeptVetAffairs today has no Secretary, no UnderSecretary of Health or Benefits and the named Acting Secretary has no background in health care and no apparent experience working in or with the VA.
While we look forward to learning more about the qualifications and views of the new nominee, we are extremely concerned about the existing leadership vacuum in @DeptVetAffairs.
We are grateful for his efforts to steer @DeptVetAffairs toward sensible, lasting transformation of @VeteransHealth and hope to see those plans continue moving forward.
In particular, he made tremendous strides in areas such as appeals modernization, mental health care access and department-wide oversight and accountability.
Under two administrations, @SecShulkin has maintained a position in one of the most highly visible, highly scrutinized organizations in Washington, working closely with veterans organizations to implement critical reforms within the @DeptVetAffairs.
We at @DAVHQ wish the best for Dr. David Shulkin. His tireless devotion to #veterans as both @DeptVetAffairs secretary and undersecretary for health are greatly appreciated by all in the veteran community.  https://t.co/tVgrSpPdQ5

You did all that and much more for an important group of people. The man or woman to your left and right is why we do what we do. Your commitment to them is why we have had such a successful week on #CapitolHill. From @FosterDelphine's closing remarks at #MidWinter18.
.@DAVHQ members commended recent efforts to simplify and improve the benefits appeals process, but derided proposals that would reduce or eliminate our current benefits.
We also stressed that Congress must enact legislation addressing identified gaps in benefits and health care services for #womenveterans.
We visited our lawmakers and urged support for SB 2193, which would not only improve and modernize the care provided to #veterans, but also extend #caregiver benefits to veterans of ALL eras.
@FosterDelphine We pressed Congress to move beyond the debate on reforming @VeteransHealth care, calling on them to enact legislation now so the @DeptVetAffairs can begin to modernize the system and improve care and services for our nation's heroes.
