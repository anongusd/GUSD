@TheWickedZen @RepThomasMassie Your logic is sound, but with emergency powers it’s case by case. Some are constitutionally okay, some aren’t. In this case, Congress has granted a lot of latitude to military construction projects and presumably that’s constitutional (defense power).

@KaMiller1 Yes, he undoubtedly likes the optics of 'national emergency.'
@KaMiller1 I'm sure he is concerned about having a yuge dollar figure. Emergency designation provides a bigger one than 10 USC 284, I suspect.
@KaMiller1 Trump could fall back to 10 USC 284 to build the wall, assuming there's no legal snag. The fact that he chose to go the 'emergency' route rather than 10 USC 284 suggests that there's something flawed or inadequate about the latter (at least in Trump's mind).
Q. Could a future POTUS declare a 'national emergency' on gun violence or global warming? 		A. Highly unlikely. Such a thing could only happen if Congress were to authorize such an emergency, in advance, in a specific statute. It has not done so and does not seem likely to.
Good summary piece on the legality of presidential emergency declarations		@JessBravin @WSJ		https://t.co/6mSVvyjQDB
I would say Trump is likely to win in court on his national emergency declaration for the wall, because he's using a power that Congress has delegated to him.		So long as he also faithfully executes existing appropriations law—he wins.

@lyndseyfifield Well done, Lindsey. The first duty of intelligent men (and women) ...
@lander Thanks, comrade.
Why do I suspect the celebrations are premature.
@lander My original statement remains true. 		Prepaid health benefits cannot be provided for free.		Insurance can be priced reasonably (by risk), and before ACA it was allowed to be, in most states. 		Insurers had to cover preexisting conditions. They did not have to subsidize them.
@conservmillen Men did not create civilization from nothing. They created it out of frustration, to end thousands of years of nagging.
@lander Insurers were willing to sell. Some people objected to the price. 		High risk pools worked just fine, where properly funded. 		Let benefits be priced according to risk &amp; ppl will buy into the pool when they are healthy. 		Provide targeted subsidies to the sick.		ACA = unnecessary
@lander HIPAA prohibited denials for preexisting conditions, although it did permit waiting periods for such conditions.
@lander No one died on the sidewalk.
@lander Before Obamacare:		States required insurance companies to provide guaranteed renewal, despite preexisting conditions. 		HIPAA imposed that rule federally. 		EMTALA required hospitals to screen &amp; stabilize everyone who showed up at the ER. 		+ Uncompensated care funding 4 indigent
@MedicalQuack @chrislhayes Fair enough.
@lander I do have to admit that, in America before Obamacare, people died from cancer and there was no cure for the common cold.

Was Judge Reed O'Connor's decision invalidating the ACA an act of judicial activism?		I don't think so.		He has taken CJ John Roberts's strained 2012 argument to its logical conclusion.		If O'Connor is smacked down, it will be for the 'crime' of exposing Emperor John's nakedness.

True redemption for Rs will come when they realize that health care *freedom* is a human right, and take a decisive stand for re-legalizing true health insurance and for providing more escape routes for people seeking non-insurance alternatives.
Banning short-term health insurance plans, as California and some other states are now seeking to do, is an egregious policy crime, akin to shooting people who are trying to flee a burning building that you yourself set on fire.
Rs have partially redeemed themselves by repealing Obamacare’s individual mandate, a policy crime that cried out to heaven for reversal, and by re-legalizing short-term, limited duration plans, which, which while not perfect, do reduce the cost of ‘insurance’ dramatically.
Republicans can be forgiven for embracing preexisting condition exclusion bans, since in the world created by Obamacare, all health ‘insurance’ questions are political, and markets are not allowed to work. But true redemption will require re-legalizing true insurance.
Because true health insurance is now illegal, people who refuse to pay for crappy, overpriced ‘insurance’ are forced to go without coverage, or work around it by opting for non-‘insurance’ alternatives like health care sharing. Outlawing such alternatives would be a crime.
The deep sin of Obamacare —its worst policy crime—is that it outlaws true health insurance, which by its nature is based on risk, and permits only prepaid group health benefits, which by their nature are defined by politics. The failure to reverse this crime is a profound tragedy

@jdn1975 2 of 2: I'm not sure you can say HR6311 "stabilizes" or "bails out" ACA. In any case Dems (like Jacobs) don't want anything to pass before the election. Bill will die. But if Santorum's effort (which I support) were to become viable, bill would likely be part of mix.
@jdn1975 HR6311? It doesn't worry me. 		1 of 2: Chris seems to oppose every GOP hc proposal (even the repeal of the individual mandate!) in hopes of somehow pulling the #fullrepeal rabbit out of the hat. I think we lost that war when McCain, Collins, Murk, Paul, Cruz, Lee killed GOP bill.

@jadler1969 @mfcannon @realDonaldTrump @CatoInstitute @SocialSecurity @HHSGov The court erred in claiming plaintiffs were trying to receive a ‘declaration of non-entitlement’ to the benefits.

@jadler1969 @mfcannon @realDonaldTrump @CatoInstitute @SocialSecurity @HHSGov I think Judge Henderson's dissent in Hall v. Sebelius was a better read than Kavanaugh's.

@ThomasStebbins @DailyCaller I write out of conviction, tho sometimes also, I confess, for the pleasure of irritating the lackeys of big business (&amp; of big labor &amp; of big government &amp; of ...).		Even if all my facts about NY's scaffold law were wrong, my constitutional argument would hold: it's a state issue.
@KellyRek Beg to differ. 1929 was caused not by laissez-faire or tax cuts but by the Fed's foolish &amp; destructive monetary interventions: crashed the market, then the banks, by manipulating credit. Politicians turned it into a depression with foolish interventions to prop up wages &amp; prices.
@LisaPinPA @daxtonbrown Yes &amp; no.

Trump wd let individuals contribute. And roll over existing HSA balances into MSAs.

@QuinHillyer I agree, Quin. I don't even support having a child tax credit, let alone expanding it. 		But Rubio has special justification for using his Corker-bestowed leverage to pull out a policy win, and if he can punish the WSJ types' gross hypocrisy in the process, all the better!

Evidence of 'discrimination' spotted on @Hillsdale College grounds		https://t.co/qENrDqMx2U
@markyzaguirre @byHeatherLong @MerrittJennifer I have not taken a view on that. I have yet to see the provision (the pdf is unsearchable). What I have been doing is pushing back on claims that Hillsdale is the only college that accepts no federal money (false), and that Hillsdale 'discriminates' (false).
@markyzaguirre @byHeatherLong @MerrittJennifer Sorry, I missed the tweet where I claimed otherwise.
@baseballcrank @Hadding_ @Bobsalltimehits @Hillsdale Lincoln haters gonna hate.
RT @bdomenech: Schumer is lying about Hillsdale. @DeanClancy is listing off the plethora of schools that take no federal funds.
At least six colleges in the United States refuse to take federal money, in order to preserve their liberty.

A backgrounder for Dems who accuse @Hillsdale College of 'discrimination.'		—Founded by abolitionists.		—Second four-year college in the US to admit women.		—60 of its students died fighting slavery in the Civil War. 4 won the Medal of Honor.		But go ahead, say 'discrimination.'
Dem senators are attacking the tax bill because of how a provision in the bill affects @Hillsdale College.
@wolfboy852001 @willpdavis There was a commitment made to Sen. Collins that the Alexander-Murray bill would get a separate vote. 		(I predict it will pass, and I suspect it woud have passed, either way.)
Dem complaints, translated:		"Budget buster": Keep taxes high.		"Tax cuts for the rich": Keep taxes high for people who pay taxes.		"Regular order": Only WE get to 'pass the bill so you can find out what's in it.'		"Lobbyist giveaway": Hey! No fair! Those are OUR lobbyists!!

@patrickrooney @rawblem So @rawblem is apparently saying, “Give the poor enough welfare and inflation is not a problem.” That strikes me as just another way of screwing the poor.
@TheStalwart Inflation occurs when the central bank monetizes the government’s debts (prints money out of thin air). 		Bad deflation occurs when government policies cause prices (incl wages and employment) to drop. 		Good deflation occurs when prices decline due to increased productivity.
@NoceraBV Housing, for starters.
The main side-effect of our current system of 'borrowing-as-we-go' to fund an ever-growing federal gov't is to screw the poor via inflation.
@ReaganBattalion My sources are reliable too. They say idea is on the table. But I don't have precise details other than that, similar to the old Gephardt Rule, it would keep increasing the debt while freeing incumbents from separate recorded debt-hike votes.
@GlennKesslerWP Before WW I, Congress voted on each new debt issuance. Should go back to that system.
@LesserFrederick Not sure. Possibly reinstate Gephardt Rule. Possibly tie automatic debt hikes to authorizations and/or appropriation. (Gephardt Rule ties debt hikes to budget res.)
Bad idea: AUTOMATIC debt hike hidden in each new spending hike.		Better idea: SEPARATE recorded debt vote at time of each new spending hike.

@INTinaT About 5% of tax filers claim the existing medical expense deduction, which is available if ur med. expenses consume more than 10% of ur AGI.
@INTinaT Under current law, premiums for self-purchased h.i. are deductible as medical expenses. Rs would end that, by repealing the m.e. deduction.
@chrisjacobsHC A sequester, enforced by impoundment, is better than no reforms. But meat-ax reductions in reimbursement rates are not 'entitlement reform.'

@DBenfordmusic @thehill @LanaCarson Yes, income transfers from young to old do tend to reduce poverty among the old. Wonder what happens to the young.
@ab232332 While tax cuts can spur growth, they do not 'pay for themselves.' If not offset, debt will go up. Debt = future tax hikes or inflation.

@CarynLonz @chrisjacobsHC @joanne_crossan @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump @FDRLST @HHSGov The feds have no constit. authority to regulate or subsidize health insurance—and they add no value in doing so. But u gotta start somewhere
@E__Strobel The bill that #GCHJ amends, H.R.1628, originated in the House. HR1628 also ends the individual mandate, by the way, tho' only formally.
RT @davidharsanyi: weirdly, the health-care insurance industry has come out against a bill that no longer forces ppl to buy their product.
@liberty_grl #GCHJ ends the Medicaid expansion after 2019. But it doesn't try to forcibly shrink the rolls, either. If it did, it could not get 51 votes.
@liberty_grl Medicaid has always been voluntary for states, but it offers so much 'free' $$ they all participate. SCOTUS has said it must stay voluntary.
@liberty_grl It leaves the fed preex mandate in  place (bad). But states can opt out if they have a diff preferred approach (good).
#GCHJ is the only bill ever endorsed by GOP leaders that actually gets rid of the indiv mandate &amp; doesn't try to replace it with anything.
Dear @RandPauI: Why do you oppose #GCHJ, which truly repeals the indiv mand, yet support the skinny bill, which retains it in a new guise?
#GCHJ doesn't 'steal' from big-gov't states like CA NY &amp; MA. It ends their gravy train, transitioning to a system of equitable block grants.
The health insurance industry strongly opposes #GCHJ. 'Nuff said.

@betterwhirled @kurteichenwald 1 of 3: Marriage has been reduced by a legal dictate to a form of officially recognized friendship unconnected w/ childbearing.
@kurteichenwald Straw man. We serious opponents never said that. We said it would denigrate and weaken real (conjugal) marriage. And it has.

@Texastrue11 Sure, but remember what the Sicilian said in The Princess Bride.
Russia and China are rising powers and potential enemies of the US. We should be friendly to both while playing them off against each other.
Iran is the other caliphate &amp; more dangerous to US interests than ISIS. That makes Iran's ally Russia the biggest potential threat to the US
China is the biggest potential loser from an erratic, nuclear-armed NK, therefore the world should let China take the lead in dealing w/ NK.
