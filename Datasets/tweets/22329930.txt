@johnson_cashman I did the work by myself in the community for 4 years until the murders of black men caused people to support me.  They still dont support our needs of housing, education, violence... in this community until the reflection of their own needs are elevated.  Unfortunately.
@johnson_cashman I don‚Äôt have a law degree yet.  Ive hardly gotten support I need when attacked by Police, politicians, agencies.  I‚Äôve been abused since my siblings and I were in the foster care system.  I‚Äôve never found accountability in it.  I use my energy to do what I‚Äôm able.
@johnson_cashman Having a table to bring people to makes change possible.  Using resources to educate and organize poor people can make a huge difference.  Self determination with access is a game changer.
@johnson_cashman The power structure doesn‚Äôt care.  Advocates don‚Äôt have the resources to help and agents of change check their budgets before answering our calls if they choose to respond.  It‚Äôs All Bad.
