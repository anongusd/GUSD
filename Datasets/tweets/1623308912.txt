It is now up to us to provide families with the certainty that these new rates will be there for them in the future as they plan for their lives.
With its lower rates, doubling of the standard deduction and doubling of the per Child Tax Credit, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was a huge win for the families of southern Missouri.
Becoming a parent is the most important job a mother or father will ever have and our tax code should recognize that, not make millions of Americans choose between starting a family or remaining in the workforce.
The old tax code punished working families for doing just that, being families.
This week I introduced the Permanent Tax Relief for Working Families Act to make the Child Tax Credit that was doubled under the Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act permanent for all families.
Thankful everyday for the brave men and women who serve in a branch of the United States armed forces and humbled by the sacrifices they make to safeguard our freedom. If you haven‚Äôt already, please thank or say a prayer for one of these selfless heroes on this Armed Forces Day
My prayers are with the victims, families, friends and students of the Santa Fe Texas community. The stories of courage from this day is what will be remembered, not the name of cowards who target the innocent.

Israel is one of our greatest allies, and instead of turning his back on them like the previous administration, our President has taken another step to strengthen our union by officially opening the new United States embassy in Jerusalem today - the Capital of Israel.
I am proud to stand with a like-minded President who also recognizes Israel‚Äôs sovereignty and supports their right to choose their own capital.
70 years to the day, Missouri native Harry S. Truman recognized Israel as an independent country, making the United States the first nation to do so.
Thankful for all the amazing mothers out there today, not only the ones that have touched my life, but each and every one that has helped make a positive impact on our nation through the years. Don‚Äôt forget to thank a mother today and remind her how important and special she is.
Take time this week to thank a teacher in your community, in your neighborhood or in your home, or reach out to an old teacher who you still think about to this day and just say 'thanks'.

Your government shouldn't be run on short term deals. Our troops have made a long term commitment to defending our freedom, and fully funding their budget shouldn't be treated as a political football.

It only takes 51 votes to pass a budget, so it would only make sense that 51 votes could appropriate the money to fund that budget, right? WRONG. Senate rules say you must have 60. So, instead of funding the government with a simple majority approval... (1/2)
We are on day two of Democrats prioritizing illegal immigrants over children‚Äôs healthcare, our men and women in uniform and a functional government. It is time for liberals to stop playing political games and take care of the people who elected them to serve.

But we also saw incredible acts of kindness ‚Äì neighbors helping neighbors, working tirelessly and selflessly to help their communities recover. #2017inMissouri8 https://t.co/SpJ4VMrRgg
Most recently, the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct was signed into law allowing our farmers to keep more of their money to invest in their farms and families. ¬†Ready to see what else we can accomplish with @realDonaldTrump in 2018!
Over the past year, we‚Äôve been able to repeal harmful regs like Waters of the US which allowed Obama‚Äôs EPA to regulate every drop of water on your land and also ended the practice of "sue and settle" where radical environmental groups sued the govt winning tax $ and new regs.
One of the best times of #2017inMissouri8 was spending the entire month of August focused on farms. Agriculture is the biggest driver of Missouri‚Äôs economy, and one of my most important fights has been to keep the government off of your land and out of your family farm. https://t.co/Sd9FjAAlh1
#2017inMissouri8 brought two Presidential visits. Together with @realDonaldTrump, we repealed $4.1B in regs, jumpstarted US economy w/ #TaxCuts, invested in domestic energy &amp; brought illegal immigration levels down to the lowest rate since 1971. Still much more work to be done. https://t.co/jgvWEyJN3B

While we continue to wait for the Senate to pass the full repeal we advanced in the U.S. House, I‚Äôm happy to say that we are ending the year with a repeal of the individual mandate and in 2018, people won‚Äôt be punished for their personal healthcare choices.
Started #2017inMissouri8 w/ healthcare roundtables &amp; heard many concerns about Obama‚Äôs failing health law. One of the biggest concerns people had with Obamacare was the individual mandate that forced them to buy something they didn‚Äôt even want ‚Äì government rationed healthcare. https://t.co/U31ufi52jC
At all of my public small business roundtables and #MainStreet stops, I heard about the need for tax relief. That‚Äôs why I fought to make sure the #TaxCutsAndJobsAct delivers the lowest tax rate for small businesses in more than 80 years! Ready to see our economy BOOM in 2018.
Did you know that #SmallBiz makes up more than 97% of Missouri businesses? #2017inMissouri8 included multiple stops at local mom and pop shops, small businesses on Main Streets across Missouri and family owned operations that send Missouri-made products around the world. https://t.co/fp26YUOifD

If the administration continues with its planned climate regulations, the GDP loss could be more than $2.5 trillion in 2030. #SOTU

Pres. Obama‚Äôs proposal for 2 years of ‚Äúfree community college‚Äù only further regulates our ed system &amp; tells students D.C. knows best. #SOTU
I want to empower America‚Äôs working families by giving them flexibility in the workplace, not pushing more bureaucratic regulations. #SOTU
The president should work with Congress to make the individual income tax code fairer and simpler. #SOTU
Instead of working with us to alleviate some burdens of #Obamacare, the pres. threatens to veto our common sense solutions. #SOTU
Gas prices are falling thanks in large part to increases in U.S. energy production. #SOTU
Our energy policy should encourage investment, lower prices, and create jobs here at home.  #SOTU
In rural America, paychecks are shrinking &amp; the employment rate is still more than 3% below pre-recession levels. #SOTU
Tonight, I hope to hear a #SOTU that reflects a desire to work with Congress, not against it.

FACT CHECK: Obama's claims on illegal immigration - http://t.co/FAvLAucwV7
I enjoyed talking this morning with the #Rolla Regional Economic Commission at Rolla City Hall. http://t.co/tcr3Ta1kGb
We are a nation of laws and any immigration reform must first secure the border. Full statement: http://t.co/U8hctNmGr4
Pres. Obama is legislating through executive action instead of letting the new Congress do its job. Full statement: http://t.co/U8hctNmGr4
The American people have asked us to work together ‚Äì but the president has decided to ignore their request.
The president‚Äôs words contradict both the Constitution and his own earlier statements. VIDEO: http://t.co/RODinfafHI
#TBT-2008 ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want a president who‚Äôs too powerful‚Ä¶ Congress‚Äô job is to pass legislation.‚Äù ‚Äì Pres. Obama #immigration
#TBT-2010 ‚ÄúI am president, I am not king. I can't do these things just by myself.‚Äù ‚Äì Pres. Obama #immigration

ICYMI - Washington Post doesn't let Democrats squirm away from #JonathanGruber. http://t.co/IKxHYCLScx #Gruber
Today I voted for #transparency - 90% agree that studies &amp; data used to make federal gov‚Äôt decisions should be public.
#ThomasJefferson said, ‚ÄúThe whole art of gov‚Äôt consists in the art of being honest.‚Äù The EPA is not being honest.
The EPA has a war on rural America. I oppose all Washington regulations that would harm our way of life.
90% of Americans agree - science behind EPA decisions made public #NoSecretScience
EPA‚Äôs carbon rule could be the most expensive in U.S. history ‚Äì that‚Äôs saying something!
Executive #amnesty will poison the well for Congress to pass meaningful immigration reform.
74% of voters want Pres. Obama to work with Congress to fix immigration, not take action on his own
Pres. Obama is talking about #amnesty for millions of illegal aliens. It‚Äôs unconstitutional.
