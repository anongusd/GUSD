Nationally, the top 1 percent of families made 25 times as much as the bottom 99 percent of workers. Raising wages for working people helps to create an economy that works for everyone, instead of just a wealthy few.
Of the 41 million low-wage workers who would benefit: more than half are women and nearly one-third work in the manufacturing, construction, education, and health care fields.
If we #RaiseTheWage to $12 by 2020, 35 million workers would get a raise. We'd also lift nearly 4.5 million people out of poverty. Even better, raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2024 would give more than 41 million Americans a pay raise.
Do you remember the last time the federal minimum wage was raised? TEN years ago.
According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition's annual report , a worker would need to earn at least $17.90 an hour in a 40 hour workweek to afford a modest one-bedroom apartment. That's more than $10 over the federal minimum wage of $7.25. https://t.co/nFsPEpUQHZ
I‚Äôd like to know where in the U.S. $7.25/hr is enough to pay for a month‚Äôs worth of rent, utilities, and groceries. If you know of such a place, take a picture and comment below.
The average 1-bedroom apartment in the U.S. costs $892/month. How much do you think you would have to earn per hour in a 40-hour workweek to afford rent?

Women of color are even worse off. In the U.S., for every $1 a man is paid, Latinas are paid just 54 cents, African American women are paid 63 cents, and Asian American and Pacific Islander women are paid 87 cents. #EqualPayDay
Unequal pay hurts our communities and the economy. Working mothers have less money to pay for their groceries, rent, and childcare. This is unacceptable. #EqualPayDay

No, @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs immigration framework is a backward approach to a 21st century economy. This country was built by immigrants and has benefited greatly from their indispensable ingenuity #SOTU #ThingsTrumpWontTalkAbout

Our country has found itself in fear and uncertainty over the past year--not safety--because of @realDonaldTrump's approach to North Korea. #SOTU #ThingsTrumpWontTalkAbout
Yes, we need a comprehensive immigration solution to our broken system. But we need a clean solution for #Dreamers now. The deadline is not in March, it was on Sep. 5, 2017 when @realDonaldTrump decided to end the program. Nearly 18K Dreamers have lost protection since. #SOTU
Let‚Äôs not get distracted by the shiny object @realDonaldTrump calls his immigration plan. This isn‚Äôt about securing our country, it‚Äôs about strictly limiting who gets to come in and who doesn‚Äôt. #SOTU #ThingsTrumpWontTalkAbout
Republican leadership and @realDonaldTrump have no interest in fixing our immigration system. Some of their proposals include eliminating diversity lottery visa, a legal pathway to come to the U.S. #SOTU #ThingsTrumpWontTalkAbout
#TPS holders from El Salvador, Honduras, &amp; Haiti contribute a combined $4.5 b to our economy. If @realDonaldTrump was serious about fixing our immigration system &amp; helping America grow, then he wouldn't have ended Protected Status for over 300K tax-paying LEGAL immigrants. #SOTU
In his Republican nomination acceptance speech, @realDonaldTrump said,‚ÄúWe will build the roads, bridges, tunnels, airports  and the railways of tomorrow.‚Äù A $1.5 trillion plan is not a viable, nor serious solution to our crumbling infrastructure. #SOTU #ThingsTrumpWontTalkAbout
@realDonaldTrump‚Äôs infrastructure only invests $1.5 trillion in 10 years. Perhaps, if Republicans weren‚Äôt too busy giving $1.5 trillion in tax breaks for millionaires, we could actually double our investment in our infrastructure.  #SOTU #ThingsTrumpWontTalkAbout
Democrats understand the rising costs of premiums and drug prices, but the solution is to improve our current healthcare system, not completely repeal it. #ThingsTrumpWontTalkAbout  #SOTU
For a year, Republicans were focused on crafting their #GOPTaxScam and repealing provisions of the ACA, neglecting funding for the opioid epidemic, Community Health Centers, veterans and CHIP. #SOTU #ThingsTrumpWontTalkAbout
How are they paying for this #GOPTaxScam? By cutting back on Medicare, Medicaid, education, veteran benefits, and working families. #ThingsTrumpWontTalkAbout  #SOTU

#GOPTaxScam https://t.co/HykPjPQLl9
For all of these reasons, and many more, I will be casting a NO vote on the #GOPTaxScam today. 11
Passing the #GOPTaxScam will also make healthcare more expensive by removing deductions for preventative care, treatment, and surgeries. We didn‚Äôt want #Trumpcare then, and we don‚Äôt want it now! 10/ https://t.co/X4DxMnKW7f
California fares worse than any state in the #GOPTaxPlan.  It makes it more expensive to build low-cost housing, and removes tax deductions that help with fire and flood damage recovery. California depends on these provisions. 9/
The #GOPTaxScam eliminates tax deductions for businesses that provide childcare ‚Äì making raising kids harder for working class Californians. 8/ https://t.co/3FN6bCqEwB
CA35 residents saw $163 million in tax savings from mortgage interest deductions.  The #GOPTaxScam would pay for corporate tax breaks by making home buying more expensive. 7/
The #GOPTaxScam does not consider unexpected large medical expenses that millions of Americans have suffered because it will no longer allow taxpayers to deduct medical expenses that exceed 10% of a family‚Äôs income.  6/
Students! The #GOPTaxBill will make it harder for working class individuals to benefit from tuition deductions because it only benefits families with tax liabilities.  5/ https://t.co/YGL7fhdP9H
36 million middle class households will see a tax increase because H.R. 1 eliminates nearly all deductions that middle class families claim. 4/
The #GOPTaxScam is especially bad for California families. Eliminating SALT would mean CA families could see their taxes go up by thousands. 3/
This is a bill by the 1% for the 1%. The wealthiest 1% will receive nearly 50% of the total tax cuts, while nearly 75% of benefits will go to the wealthiest fifth of the population. 2/
