@cooperpharmacy @RBG_4LIFE @SenSanders Ending The Drug War, Bail Reform, Deeper Criminal Justice Reforms, Higher Mininum Wage, all tangibles that will help my Black community right now. I know how politics work how "wedge issues" are used. Smarter to push @SpeakerPelosi to bring HR40 to the floor this year for a vote.
@cooperpharmacy @RBG_4LIFE @SenSanders These are tangibles I will take any day of the week. Things I want that will benefit my family and other families in my community. I want HR 40 passed to study what they call reparations and will lobby for its passage but I am not going to hold my vote hostage to one token issue.
@cooperpharmacy @RBG_4LIFE @SenSanders Abolishing Private Prisons leads to ending Prison Slavery impacting Black people the most, Medicare4All Helps Black people the most who lack access and therefore have higher mortality rates, Zero Tuition Fee at State Colleges and University will help Black people shut out of EDU.
In conversations I hope will be on-air in the future with members of @DesAmerSlaves and  #DASPAC, they are not seeking reparative policies for pre-civil war slavery but seeking legal damages for the widespread constitutional violations that occurred to #DAS post civil war. https://t.co/Js5U33ApDv

@feather_amenya Yes, there are but I've noticed more Black women are being showcased as faces and voices of the MSM as if they represent the views of Black people as a collective when they are partisan Democratic party operatives presenting false narratives to create false perceptions.
It is really sickening to see people make up fake hate crimes when they get called to account for lies they tell on tv. To deflect from their dishonesty, they play the victim card &amp; whine about people being mean to them who are simply asking them why they are lying.
@ZerlinaMaxwell Too Many Corporate News Negroes Working For White Corporations Like CNN and MSNBC Are Not An Ally To Black People. The fact is you lied about what was said and when it was said at that rally. You can play the victim but there is videotape so you should really stop lying about it.
MSNBC &amp; CNN are turning Black women on tv into the least trusted source of information on the planet. This is why we need a Black media revolution, a media for the people by the people and not Black people working for corporate news oligarchs spreading disinformation for dollars.
@ZerlinaMaxwell When "news reporters" go on national television and tell bald face lies in the face of evidence to the contrary, they should be held accountable. People believe they can lieand then play the victim when they are called to account. It is sickening.

Every 4 years, there is talk and no action and HR 40 is no closer to being passed than the 100 times it was introduced in the past. Tonight I will be talking with a rep from a group that says first, there has to be legislation advanced legally defining who is an "American slave".
@SpeakerPelosi saying she supports HR 40 but then waffled in the rest of her answer. Like I've said, the Democratic-controlled House could advance it and pass it next week, get Dems in the Senate to do the same although the GOP controls it and they don't care about Black votes.

This is why on my last podcast, I asked if what Malcolm X said was still true today, Black voters are politically immature, we keep voting for Democrats and get nothing, not that the GOP is any better. I also asked do we collectively even know the rules of political gaming.
Watch, after this election season, all the rabble-rousers talking reparations now, who never talk about politics or political strategy for Black Voters, in fact, some tell you voting is waste of time but every 4 years they become one issue political operatives on Twitter.
In fact, that should have been an issue during the midterms and asked of every candidate but unfortunately, the Black community and "allies" were more focused on Trump because that what talking heads in media told you to do and electing Democrats with no reparations demand.
If people are serious about a reparations demand or are competent about how politics work and agendas get passed, the pressure would not come just during Presidential campaign season, pressure would be applied to @SpeakerPelosi and Dem leadership right now to pass HR 40.
Observation: The reparations demands come every 4 years when people run for President?  @JulianCastro is just calling for the passage of HR 40 which he did not mention by name and made it sound as if he would be do something new.

Observation: Simply asking a politician if they support "reparations" gives them room to give a vague "yes" answer because different reparations groups among Afro-Americans descended from victims of slavery are asking for different policies. Ask more specific questions.....

@Highcentered Pick any amount that you think is owed. Would Congress vote to have 100 Trillion in Petro Dollars printed up by the Federal Reserve to pay in reparations? Should anyone accept "dollars" for reparations as surely the currency would be devalued at that point.
Would Congress Commission The Federal Reserve to Print Up 10 Trillion Dollars of Debt notes to pay reparations? Will be discussing this and more with a group rep later this week seeking "legal" designation of "American Slave Descendant" and has introduced legislation in Kentucky.

@NNonnac I am going to be true to myself and my principles first and foremost. I will be making a donation to the Pan African reparations movement called NCOBRA because I follow the teachings of Malcolm X and other Black revolutionaries. Have a good day. Best of life to you and yours.
@NNonnac I can walk and chew at the same time. Meaning, I don't have to be shallow and only do one thing, I can multitask. I have been alienated from that hashtag because I refuse to be connected to something sporting a colonizing slavers flag and has anti-African or Pan African elements.
@NNonnac Look, this has ceased to be constructive, you making statements that are patently false. I am a Pan Africanist, I have a political Agenda, my main focus is actually ending slavery, abolishing private prisons. I am also a Black American tracing roots back to the 1700s in NC.
@NNonnac I offfered a critique, you took as a personal attack on it, while spouting things about Pan Africanism and other things I know to be untrue. Focus on the US govt, not me, not Pan Africanist, not Africans, focus on the ones who owe you reparations. I'm done. Good day.
@NNonnac You can not speak for all people using a hashtag, a white person can create a fake account and use the hashtag to attack other black people and the work their doing and the concepts they practice. Don't tell me I am making up these attacks no matter who they from.
Also, those who have businesses, we have an ad network that allows us to geo-target certain parts of the country so only those will see your business in your local area. This isn't advertising but a gift for supporting our work.
@NNonnac Its like a sorry dude in order to date a girl, trashing and bad mouthing her other suitors to make it look like he is all she needs. Why is that necessary to trash stuff you don't support no little about to prop up what you doing. That's weak AF part of the problem.
@NNonnac I don't disagree and that is what my network has been doing for 11 years. And WHY is it so troubling that people using this hashtag are attacking us. We got to fight white and Black people on Pan Africanism, thats a problem.
Thank you to those who made donations to our non-profit this morning after hearing us Thando Radio this morning about how we are losing Black radio stations due to lack of support and Black platforms we have built online.
@NNonnac Last thing, white people practicing Eurocentricism, including those here in USA. They all work together to put sanctions on non-white nations to force them into submission. They have Africom in Africa, bases all over the word in joint excersises with white dominated nations.
@NNonnac Why do you think Malcolm X traveled abroad? Why he was then willing to work with Dr. King here on Domestic issues. Malcolm X told us we are politically immature and that is still true today. We don't see ourselves as part of a global struggle and why we lose.
@NNonnac You have misconstrued Pan Africanism which recognizes that the oppression of Black people is global. It seeks to educate us all to work together on a world stage through platforms like the UN and why a UN panel recently made the case that the USA owes Black Americans reparations.
The issue of Prisoners Human Rights is being discussed right now as part of 40th session of UN Human Rights Council. @UNHEARDVOICES16 @IWW_IWOC  @NAREndSlavery  https://t.co/UYF4WuUm75
@NNonnac Lets again, be honest, if we had real "citizenship" why we got to fight against our continued enslavement through the prisons and being killed by police slave catchers or still fighting institutional racism? Thanks for the dialogue, gotta run.
@NNonnac Actually Ghana has offered automatic citizenship to any Afro descendant person in the Diaspora. All you got to do is apply. I'm not leaving but I know I have options. I think Ghana is also offering land as a form of reparations to us. I know people who went and retired there.
@NNonnac So the point of post was to question why the hell do we or any non-white person adopting the US colonizer flag to show they are unified. Create your own Flag if you must have symbology like Garvey did.
@NNonnac And of course when he came out against the Vietnam war and the violence of the USA. Because they knew he was making Black people question going off to kill non-white people while being lynched and mistreated right here by the USA.
@NNonnac While I support reparations movements by Black people worldwide, I don't think we will ever see a check. This country is in the most debt it has ever been in and why it keeps stealing resources from non-white nations. They murdered King when he said, I'm coming to get out check.
@NNonnac I agree with you on principle but we got to understand we will never have 100% unity in this country or worldwide because of white supremacist have divided us with propaganda and destroy organizations that threaten it like they did the Black Panthers and Garvey's movement.
@NNonnac I am not saying we should not try to advance an agenda in this system but like some elders from Black Panther told me, we are just helping people the best we can pending revolution. I think USA will crumble like the Roman empire from self inflicted wounds B4 there is revolution.
@NNonnac I happen to think that anything we do will fall short of what is needed. Malcolm X told us what the cost of freedom is, it is death. But we will die as soldiers of white supremacy but not willing to engage in the same for ourselves.
@NNonnac But like I said, Black people since after the civil war, including my young ignorant self back in the 80s and early 90s have been turned into murderous colonizers flying that flag, marching with it, wearing on our sleeve. We are the colonizers who got nothing for our part in it.
@NNonnac All those flags are not colonial, that is a lie but I get the point and the US Stars and Bars is murderous colonizer's flag. I don't care to debate the merits of a hashtag, thats what you trying to make it about, not me.

I can get down with all that @SenSanders but your staff was asked by the @NAREndSlavery in SC about the 13th Amendment exception for slavery. These things are symptoms of the neo-slavery created by the exception for "crime". Do you support repealing and replacing the 13th? https://t.co/krXbIqzIlM

@sleepfreeparent @RoryFleming8A I would not say that was a show trial, but I don't live in Baltimore and know everything like you would not know everything that happens in my county. So thanks for the information. You are right, I would have a hard time voting for any prosecutor for President.

@Sir_mix_a_thot @JudgeJoeBrownTV I don't think having enough to eat is a matter of socialism or capitalism. There are plenty of hungry people in the United States, some areas are no different than third world countries. There was a time in my life I was surviving off Ramen noodles.

@Sir_mix_a_thot @JudgeJoeBrownTV Another resource and you will have to google it and download the PDF file. PNAC paper titled "Rebuilding Americas Defenses". Things you have seen in the last 20 years were called for in that policy paper. You are seeing the same people pop up in Trump's admin who were in that org
@Sir_mix_a_thot @JudgeJoeBrownTV I think the Neocon in Trump's cabinet that brought Abrams in, is telling you what's up. "It will make a big difference to the United States economically if we could have American oil companies invest in and produce the oil capabilities in Venezuela." - John Bolton
@Jimzallabim I don't see it the same way you do because correcting the wrongs against us should not require us to attack other victims. Mr. Fuller recommendations and Dr. Welsing talked about the Global System of WS. 3 people in the universe, white, white supremacist and non-white.
@Sir_mix_a_thot @JudgeJoeBrownTV The only businesses they "took over" was to nationalize the oil fields, take the profits to help the people since the oil belonged to everyone. That is a familiar pattern of when they do regime change when they nationalize natural resources. The oil corporations don't like that.

North Carolinia isn't as bad as you trying to make it out to be. Sure there are problems with the stuff the GOP pushes but that is all over the country.
@Jimzallabim Well I'm sorry if that came off as name calling, did not mean it that way but meant collectively we seem to losing a grasp of the history of that flag if we are going to defend it. The only justice we fought for under it was to end slavery, which the USA then lied about that.
@Jimzallabim Oh, yes, the Five so-called civilized tribes in the East, the Cherokee fought with the Confederacy to keep Black ppl in slavery and then when they got their asses kicked out west to Oklahoma, they tried to purge their nations of Black people, victims of their slavery.
@Jimzallabim Do you know what they did in Puerto Rico while Black people were being lynched in the USA? They fought in the Spanish American war, killing for the American empire which led to it being a US colony to this day. Ain't no Black people fought injustice under that flag. SMH
@Jimzallabim Their job while sporting the US flag was to hunt down and kill American Indians in the West and take their land and then to protect white settlers going to settle on that stolen land while Black people just out of slavery was not permitted to even get 40 acres and a mule. Geez!
@Jimzallabim Some Black people have truly lost their goddamn minds when they sound like racist white supremacist trying to whitewash US history to justify their bullshit. I used to be proud of the Buffalo Soldiers, was station at their home base. Do you know what their job was?
@Jimzallabim WHAT? That is nonsense. African Americans DOS or whatever label you want to adopt have committed grave injustices to non-white people under that flag including myself when I was a dumbass no nothing young man in the US military. "Our flag" my ass.

@Sir_mix_a_thot @JudgeJoeBrownTV I don't know if people recall the gas crisis in the year before Carter was to face Reagan, the Regan ppl got Saudia Arabia to do the reverse, drive oil prices up causing gas prices to go up. Not to mention they got the Iranians not to release the hostages until after the election
@Sir_mix_a_thot @JudgeJoeBrownTV From what I have read, yes. Venezula was vulnerable because their number one export was oil. What I read is that the US got Saudi Arabia to flood the market unnecessarily with oil driving the price down thus affecting VZ ability to fund their social programs. Then came sanctions.

@DerekAudette @JudgeJoeBrownTV I have not read it, first hearing of it. A synopsis says "The Law of Nations has been said to have modernized the entire practice of international law."
Here is a fact for those who say "few" Black immigrants stood with American Born Blacks during the civil rights and Black Power movements. Guess what, the majority of ABBs did not stand with them either and many ABB still trash Dr. King to this day.
@JudgeJoeBrownTV Does that refer to international law Judge? I don't want to assume. I was just researching if calling for the assassination of a head of state is against US law given Marco Rubio is tweeting about killing Maduro like was done to Gaddafi after calls for it by Hillary Clinton.
However, you can not amend an amendment. You have to repeal it like the Amendment prohibiting alcohol was repealed. Then you have to replace it with an Amendment that abolishes slavery with no exception clause.
I was pleased to find this in a group on FB for Abolitionists I manage.

@JudgeJoeBrownTV We would not even be having a "illegal" immigration problem if those people were safe and secure in their home countries. The sad facts is, this is because of fascist US policy and the violence it has backed or done in the name of fighting socialism in those places.

@ceoofkti Mighty funny that you would say I am "misconstruing" when the videos are on Youtube. It is sad that they attack Black immigrants as the problem and not white supremacy as why American Descendant of Victims of Slavery like myself have not gotten reparations and being mistreated.

@RBG_4LIFE @blacksage72 Xenophobia is no small thing in the political areana right now because it is rightly seen as an expression of white supremacy by the Trump adminstration. But thanks for a constructive dialogue, others have been hostile towards my political critiques as if I am against reparations
@RBG_4LIFE @blacksage72 I don't disagree with your criticism of gatekeepers but I have been a political analyst a long time and I even defended them against the fake Russian bot attacks from gatekeepers but there was no need to give them the ammunition to discredit ADOS or distract from reparations.
@RBG_4LIFE @blacksage72 Last thing, and you are 100 percent correct to call Morial a gatekeeper. The current Black misleadership class has failed us in obtaining reparations but because of political immaturity on behalf of ADOS, gatekeepers now have ammunition to attack this movement and get it banned.
@RBG_4LIFE @blacksage72 I am not going to write you a lecture on Twitter and will produce a video to go along with my last podcast on this anti-blackness on display by self hating Black people and how it takes the focus off reparations and puts it on the xenophobic rants of politically immature ppl.
@RBG_4LIFE @blacksage72 If ppl are going to confront the xenophobia towards non-whites deeply embedded in the white supremacist supporters of Trump and the GOP, it would be hypocritical not to confront it among Black people.
@RBG_4LIFE @blacksage72 Oh I know Black people the world are not monolithic in their views and him and others pushing back on xenophobia among Black people is evident that we all don't share the same values and principles on Afro Unity with those we can and have worked with.
@RBG_4LIFE @blacksage72 Nobody said anything about not advocating for Black Americans so your deceptive attempt to put words in my mouth is clear.  He is talking about "efforts to divide" Black people and the definition of xenophobia is clear. The hatred of ppl based on their national origins.

I came home briefly on leave from the US Army and met with that sorry ass lawyer he had who ended up getting disbarred. I never told my brother how bad I felt going back to my duty station feeling helpless to help him. I still feel like I let him and my mother down.
He was sent to prison slavery on just the word of a white man lying to an all-white jury with a white male judge presiding without a single shred of physical evidence.
I wrote today about why I vehemently oppose any movement that pushes the notion of presumed guilt on just someone's word. I included my younger brother's story in the piece.
Social media has taught me over the past 11 years that the majority of the USA is populated with professional and amateur liars. These liars are enabled by lazy ass people who just cosign without the integrity to fact check nor critically think about what ppl say.

@Behembaba I'm pretty much done here, thanks for the dialogue, I hope one day you adopt a more nuanced view because I can't be associated with xenophobes who won't acknowledge ADOS role in victimizing non-white people since the end of the Civil war and are willing tools of global racism.
@Behembaba It is a myth to you because you don't practice it. You allowed yourself to get into your emotions because of what a few colonized mindless Africans said. Slavery is alive again in Libya and a ADOS was given a medal for helping to murder a Pan Africanist who tried to help ADOS.
@Behembaba You are discrediting yourself by promoting xenophobia. I don't have to go argue with Black immigrants because the ones associated with my organization and media network support me and they ain't trying to derail reparations for ADOS. But go ahead, you free to hate on whomever.
@Onitaset I don't think it is accurate to say that the #ADOS movement which actually has an agenda website is all about "denouncing more recent African migrants" but there is no denying that there is a xenophobic element within the group that could undermine their efforts and its a concern

@thewrinkledpres @realDonaldTrump I did a poll last week and asked if @realDonaldTrump started pushing for reparations for ADOS would you vote for him. There was only 1 no vote.

@smac0905 Right, I've never voted in a Presidential race when other offices, federal, state and local races and ballot initiative are not also on the ballot. Even the primaries include more than just a Presidential candidate.

Fighting Back Against Harris Supporters &amp; MSNBC Contributors Targeting Black Americans #ADOS With Disinformation Campaign https://t.co/Z0jTnXpKGu via @blacktalkradio https://t.co/qg91Zenn6C
RT @kevin_powell: New York City! The annual celebration on the passing of my greatest hero, MALCOLM X, Thurs Feb 21. Please see attached fl‚Ä¶
@Behembaba I just talked to a brother from the Carribean on our network who agrees only ADOS should get reparations from the US govt and he should get it from the UK. I'm afraid we are creating enemies of allies. Some immigrants don't care for us but not all and we should recognize that.
@Behembaba You must not have ever belonged to a coalition of those fighting racism against all non-white people. We can advocate for reparations from the US govt w/o attacking other Black people who ain't done nothing to us but we have harmed ppl through our US military service. Own that!
@Behembaba Black Brits do, one of them volunteers for my non-profit to support independent Black media. You got people around the world through the UN supporting reparations for ADOS so it is a mistake to attack ppl as the enemy, the racists and their non-white proxies are the enemy.
@Behembaba How come ADOS can't stop killing non-white people around the world? You sound like you just want to get the benefits from the American empire and extra butter biscuits, want to hold other ppl accountable but not yourself. That man ain't come to intentionally harm us. #willielynch
People in the #ADOS talking about not voting if all their agenda isn't met. Of course, you should advance your agenda but boycotting elections would be welcomed by those that don't want Negroes to vote. How about stop being poorly paid mercs in the US military unless.....
@Behembaba White Supremacy is global and created many refugees around the world. I would like to see all ADOS boycott US military service and stop helping to kill non-white people around the world like I naively did as 22 yr old only leaving after reading Malcolm's Bio during the Gulf War.
@Behembaba I think you are going too far. Can you say he is being used by racists in the USA without his knowledge to replace ADOS just as poor European immigrants were brought in to undermine Black labor? Yes, but to suggest that he is knowingly engaged in conduct to harm ADOS is BS.
@KamalaHarris needs to issue a statement to reign in her supporters who are attacking Black Americans in the #ADOS movement by associating it with a Russian Conspiracy to prevent her from obtaining office. Black Americans have a right to political expression free from harrasement
Stop retweeting these coordinated attacks on #ADOS to suppress and discredit the political speech of Black Americans by calling them Russian bots. It is a deliberate smear and was done to Black leaders during the Civil Rights movement decades ago. Report these tweets as abusive.
@bernardigiri @pastorhodge @KamalaHarris @KamalaHarris20 @BreakingBrown That is the dumbest damn thing yet. You sound like those racists that smeared Paul Robeson, MLK Jr, Malcolm X with this Russian BS. I advise all #ADOS to start reporting these ppl tweets as offensive and targeting a group of Black people. Stop being a racist tool.
@bernardigiri @KamalaHarris @KamalaHarris20 This is how you know the entire Russian bot narrative is fake, the establishment and their lackeys are certainly overplaying their hand with the whole Russian conspiracy BS. A DNC operative busted in Alabama for creating bot accounts to smear Roy Moore as if that was required.

@KamalaHarris @KimberlyFain This country spends more to incarcerate children than it does on education.

@StephBee8111 @_ZEROSYSTEM @keishajones @RealTimBlack Dude, I know that and made no reference to Pan Africanism. I'm not new to this. I've known Yvette for years as she has been a guest on shows affiliate with my network and I follow her. So stop trying to put words in my mouth.
@StephBee8111 @_ZEROSYSTEM @keishajones @RealTimBlack Actually the New Abolitonists Movement has gotten traction and I corrected myself in that they did mention it because we have been lobbying Tone and Yvette for years on that and so they heard us. I'm not some petty person t jealous of something that will help my family.
@StephBee8111 @keishajones @RealTimBlack No. I have bad eyes and see it is addressed, so I stand corrected, I am so glad the 13th Amendment is addressed. My bad, missed that part. That was my only concern considering how long I've been pointing the 13th out. I would like to see some repeal and replacement language added
@StephBee8111 @keishajones @RealTimBlack How do you not leverage the international community in the ADOS fight for reparations considering that a UN panel stated the US owes reparations not just for slavery past but for continued racial terrorism? https://t.co/8zn5wGB4lm
@StephBee8111 @keishajones @RealTimBlack How in the hell do you create an Agenda for #ADOS that does not demand an end to legalized slavery as codified in the 13th Amendment? How do you not demand the 13th be repealed and replaced with an amendment with no exceptions for slavery? ü§î https://t.co/nrx8YeNlHa
@StephBee8111 @keishajones @RealTimBlack lol... cool but at least we are having dialogue however I do have a question about the #ADOS agenda and both Tone and Yvette now who I am and the New Abolitionists Movement I created in 2014. My question follows for all Descendants of Slaves.....
@StephBee8111 @keishajones @RealTimBlack Never mind, I think you do get where I am coming from. I hate this evil empire and its evil as hell. I would like to get reparations first, but that ain't likely to happen and if Trump destroys it or speeds up its demise, I'm good with that.
@StephBee8111 @keishajones @RealTimBlack No, I don't think you get, I think you are also politically immature. Let me state it more plainly. I want the US government to be dissolved. I want it to break up like the old soviet union. Is that plain enough for you? But in the meantime, I will vote for the best candidates.

@StephBee8111 @keishajones @RealTimBlack I'm not the one huge barged and told another person that he just wants to debate, you posted the agenda. I did not ask that person for the #ADOS agenda. I asked Tim Black how do you pass race specific legislation in this system besides reparations. Then you mocked me. So yeah.
@StephBee8111 @keishajones @RealTimBlack You 100% correct! But that's not my question. My question is, are you saying you won't vote in an election, whether we talking city gov, county gov and federal gov, unless the candidate promises to deliver on every single bullet point of the agenda?

@StephBee8111 @keishajones @RealTimBlack So what I am hearing, unless a candidate can promise everything on my agenda regardless of the ability to deliver it in this system, then I won't vote. Is that correct? Not just POTUS candidates but any office from a county, city or state level. Is that right?
@keishajones @StephBee8111 @RealTimBlack This is a thread where I asked Tim Black a question. Then questions or responses were posed to me and I responded. If you don't want to dialogue with ppl then just STFU and let grown folks talk children.
@SirbobbyX @JudgeJoeBrownTV I agree with you, especially when you got Black pols acting as Gate Keepers.

@keishajones @RealTimBlack I think if you want a "Black Agenda" to be implented, it ain't going to be done by the racist Democrat and Republican Parties. Maybe #ADOS needs to start a political party and run their own candidates because the two parties are gate keepers and we have to be real about that.
@keishajones @RealTimBlack Here is platform for Black people pushed by the Black Panther Party the year I was born. I want everything listed in it. Black people been making these demands for decades.

@skeenscene @Daroff This is like saying the BDS movement against racist aparthied in South Africa was anti white. Lets stop with the bullshit.
@skeenscene @Daroff Bullshit. Being critical of a nations human rights record and conducting boycotts is rooted in the Black civil rights movement. This is about protecting a white supremacist settler class, not Semitic ppl of which Palestinians are Semitic if you use the word properly.
@keishajones @RealTimBlack I've seen the platform and many of those issues are being addressed by a number of politicians although not successfully. Some of this stuff needs to be pushed on a state level, In terms of the POTUS we are left to examine which candidate already aligns most with our concerns.
@prof_smartass @RealTimBlack And btw, the CBC every time it comes up, votes to fund the drug war, to arm cops with military weapons, extra money to target communities with drug arrests. We don't even have sanctuary cities like undocumented even when the mayor and council are damn near all Black. Thats local.
@prof_smartass @RealTimBlack He already has a platform for addressing police violence and criminal justice. But still, that ain't a race-specific issue no matter how the MSM tries to frame it, cops kill everyone, over 1000 a year. You can't pass legislation that Black people are exempt from all arrests.
@SirbobbyX @RealTimBlack President Trump signed an executive order establishing an Opportunity and Revitalization Council with the aim of creating economic opportunity zones in distressed communities.  https://t.co/FlaMtUmMWf
@SirbobbyX @RealTimBlack Wait a min, Trump signed a policy in Dec to buy Black votes. He calls them  Opportunity Zones. Even he knows you can not pass race specific legislation, unless we talking reparations for #ADOS. We are not electing presidents for "Black America" cause it don't exist bro.
@SirbobbyX @RealTimBlack 1) I don't believe that 2) If true, it had nothing to do with President of USA and was a local issue and a project supported by local business ppl and politicians. I am talking federal policy, not city policy, not county policy, not state policies.
@RealTimBlack I also want to know if that demand is placed on every candidate. I don't even want to play this unrealistic game with people likely not to vote any way and those who do, mainly back establishment corporate eye candy candidates. Not worth my time.
@RealTimBlack All Black people don't have to register for the draft. All Black people get free housing? All Black people are exempt from taxes? All Black people and only black people get a monthly check from the US govt? I'm trying to figure out what people are talking about or just talking?
@RealTimBlack I got a question for you, other than reparations for #ADOS, something the CBC doesn't seriously try to advance, How does one pass legislation "specifically" for Black communities? How do you even frame that conversation? Let's be real because sounds like you asking him to pander
@BadCatLogic @JudgeJoeBrownTV You cite an impossible situation with a corporate controlled corrupt DNC, one of only two pathways to office, and because he would not kill a future chance at the nomination by completely burning bridges just to give you a sound byte is not a logical political strategy.

@ty_brazil @JudgeJoeBrownTV Strawman arguments. Do I support and want reparations. Yes I do, I am also against abortions on demand but I'm not a single issue voter, I look at who has policies that will help my community the most without needing them to pander to me on one issue.
@ty_brazil @JudgeJoeBrownTV You know when Sanders announced his policy for Free College Tuition, something that would certainly help Black people, as well as Medicaid for All, but I heard Black people supporting Clinton say, all Black people just want something for free. Here we go again.
@BadCatLogic @JudgeJoeBrownTV How did he "allow" it to be stolen? Did he give Clinton and the DNC permission to rig the primary? You do know he made them make changes for future elections. I don't think you know how politics really work in this corrupt nation. You are victim blaming.

@JudgeJoeBrownTV @NiceJewishMama @OAP @KevDread @tariqnasheed @saramommy1988 Sure money can make us more comfortable but not eliminate the hurt of oppression but according to researchers like @SandyDarity and other economic academics, the collective Black family is broke.
@JudgeJoeBrownTV @OAP @KevDread @tariqnasheed @saramommy1988 Bunche is also reportedly a descendant of Punch who was married to a free white woman when he got sentenced to slavery. Those children from that union more than likely continued to marry white people erasing the African traits. Not saying they don't have other lineages of course.
@JudgeJoeBrownTV @OAP @KevDread @tariqnasheed @saramommy1988 My grandfather, a Reid, is #ADOS out of neighboring Lincoln County, my grandmother was a Rankin. One of my ADOS cousins just got elected Mayor of Gastonia. What I am saying is a family's skin color and hair can change in just a few generations. Obama momma is ADOS.
@JudgeJoeBrownTV @OAP @KevDread @tariqnasheed @saramommy1988 Part of my maternal lineage is Scottish immigrants that settled the land I am on right now. The Rankin family, there are eight different family lines of Rankins in my county, they helped found Gaston County. I am obviously one of the descendants of the line that turned Black.
@JudgeJoeBrownTV @OAP @KevDread @tariqnasheed @saramommy1988 Are saying that this research is fradulent? Is that what you are saying? Or is it hard for you to believe that white people can be descendants of African victims of slavery after hundreds of years of interacial mating? You have a link to the research, I'm open to looking at it.

@JudgeJoeBrownTV @OAP @KevDread @tariqnasheed @saramommy1988 Another of Punch's descendants was the Zionist Ralph Bunche who won the nobel peace prize for helping deprive Palenstinians of their homeland.
@JudgeJoeBrownTV @OAP @KevDread @tariqnasheed @saramommy1988 It is in dispute whether Punch was the first slave, what is not in dispute is that Obama is one of his descendants and therefore #ADOS Obama roots traced to first slave in US named John Punch https://t.co/pAla0hPJoH

@thehuntinghouse @FredBVKarl Exactly and of course Clinton came out declaring criticism of Harris is rooted in misogyny. It is an illegitimate deflection which is actual misogyny because it pushes the notion that females are too sensitive to handle political critiques.

@FredBVKarl Just admit, you are full of it and can't attack Sander's on policiy so you make up bullshit and push stuff that has nothing to do with him. It should not be surprising that anyone in the Black community doesn't trust a person who called themselves a "Top Cop". So come off the BS.
@FredBVKarl I can not see the tweet because it is a person I had blocked long ago. So how is this person a "Bernie Bro"? Kamala Harris has a dubious record that people like me have been calling out since 2014 when her office argued to keep ppl locked up as a cheap labor pool.
The same with Syria, there is still no Congressional authorization for US troops in the country and that is a result of executive action in a BS "War on Terror" when we know the real goal was to overthrow Assad.
Listen, I don't support @realDonaldTrump border wall but I got to ask, where were the lawsuits when the Obama administration through executive authority launched a war on Libya without congressional authorization? I think many Dems are not acting in good faith given the hypocrisy
@RoryFleming8A @KamalaHarris @MarilynMosbyEsq @JohnFPfaff @shaunking @xenocryptsite And I support that effort, I do agree that politics are local and local elected judges and DAs are not being scrutinized by voters as they should. But at the same time, I am concerned about private prisons and their role. I pay close attention to the industry.
@FredBVKarl Sure they are but these are not Bernie voters, these are coming from a sub culture in the Black community who likely don't vote anyway. Your attempt to characterize them as Bernie Bro (misandry) is just more of the same BS from your camp in 2016.
@FredBVKarl Oh, BTW, I was speaking to Clinton's issues but see now the same crap talking points used to deflect from Clinton's record is being used to deflect from Kamala's record. Are some Blk people questioning her pandering to Black voters, sure, are some talking about her parentage.
@RoryFleming8A @KamalaHarris @MarilynMosbyEsq @JohnFPfaff @shaunking @xenocryptsite Most people enter into the system on drug charges, then the three strikes or parole violations that get them locked back up is related to those original drug charges. I really don't know what your intent in minimizing the private prison lobby but whatever.
@FredBVKarl And what really cost her, was the deal she had with the DNC to pay off their debt in exchanged for rigged primary to give her nomination. None of the things I've mentioned has to do with her age, skin color or gender.
@FredBVKarl Her damn private email server, her hundred thousand dollar secret speeches to Bankers, her lack of support for $15 minimum wage, her rejection of Medicare for All, her rejection of free tuition at state colleges and universities. I can go on and on.
@FredBVKarl I reject the #BernieBro as misandry so let me state that first. You are full of shit. Lots of people but expecially Black people cited her stances on so-called mass incarceration, racist troupes in support of welfare reform,the coup in Hondurus and the destruction of Libya.
@rolandsmartin @JussieSmollett Not that very long ago, we saw a "Just Believe Her" campaign which in my mind is counter to justice and those people pushing that were not saying, lets wait for the facts to come out after investigation. "Just Believe Him" is what I have seen related to Smollette.
@rolandsmartin @JussieSmollett I find it interesting that before the investigation was completed that people were just running with the story about the alleged attack as if it were true based on just his word including you, did you not? If I am mistaken I apologize but I think you ran with  the initial story.
@RoryFleming8A @KamalaHarris @MarilynMosbyEsq @JohnFPfaff Vast majority of people in prison are in there for non-violent drug "crimes". I ain't got a problem with incarcerating violent criminals but I don't know why you are minimizing the role of the private prison lobby. I support abolishing private prisons as a human rights issue.
@BlakeDontCrack @AfrikansUnite It also supports child slave labor used to harvest cocoa beans in Africa.
@RoryFleming8A I am not saying Prosecutors like @KamalaHarris don't play a role in legalized slavery, I am saying to minimize hundreds of millions of dollars from the private prison lobby is a mistake. I like what Mosby is doing in Baltimore by declining to prosecute cannabis possession cases.

@JoshuaCatlow @IAmSophiaNelson @Kaepernick7 As the old proverb says, "A Bird in the Hand is Worth Two in the Bush". The lawsuit was based on what was done to them, not to every Black person who has been discriminated against. I settled my own employment discrimination lawsuit over 20 years ago out of court.
@JoshuaCatlow @IAmSophiaNelson @Kaepernick7 How do you know they don't need money or enough money to continue whatever they want to continue. We know the NFL is racists and colluded against the two. They could have gone into court and lost so that is something to consider as we all should when suing an employer.
@IAmSophiaNelson @Kaepernick7 Who did they silence? No one. Both men still out here involving themselves in social justice issues and Reid who just signed a long term deal, still taking a knee. The NFL paid damages after they were sued which was the objective of the lawsuit. Your hot take makes no sense to me

@JamilSmith These men did not file a lawsuit so writers can have something to write about. They filed a lawsuit seeking damages for lost wages due to a political stance they took. Employment lawsuits get settled out of court all the time and they had an obligation to their famlies.
@JamilSmith The point of the lawsuit was to seek financial compensation for financial harm. We all know the collision was real and by the NFL settling, they too are admitting enough evidence existed. Given that courts are biased and they could lose, they did the smart thing imo.

I would have never joined the US Army if my mother could have afforded to pay my tuition and I back then I did not want to take out loans to put my family in debt when I had siblings coming up behind me. I was coerced by poverty into becoming a weapon in unjust wars, the Gulf War
Some of these Black people said about Black people who wanted free college tuition, "they just want something for free" as they threw their support behind Clinton. I knew then this was about maintaining the status of "elites" in Black America.
Would tuition-free college help more black people go to these HBCUs that are financially failing and too expensive for most people? I was disgusted by some Black people, college educated, and what they were saying about Sander's plan for tuition free college for all.
They are coming off as elitists which is really what a lot of Black frats and sororities are about. They were never down with tuition-free college for the masses as @SenSanders proposed, they only cares about getting crumbs from the US government to support HBCUs.
We have a 1% in the Black community who have more wealth than the majority of working-class Black people combined. When Sanders talks about wealth inequality, that same thing can be said about just our demographic.

Harris talked about Black women &amp; fair pay. I want to know who is speaking up for Black men who always faced discrimination in pay. Who the hell is trying to get us equal pay? I later caught her having sex on the job one night. Is that how she earned that $10,000 yr more than me?
I had a job supervising a shift for a dye company. I had more experience, education and was doing a better job according to metrics. Yet, I found that the white woman supervising 2nd shift, a 20 something not long out of high school was making $10,000 a year more than me. https://t.co/mbB1Fp658c

Some of you say @KamalaHarris was doing her job in terrorizing and jailing parents and children for truancy and that they needed to be held accountable. Ok, so how many crooked cops and prosecutors and drug lab techs did she hold accountable or did she shield them? I'll wait üòë

The transatlantic slave trade was only possible because of the caste systems or classism in Africa within and between nations and tribes. Kamala Harris and the people like her make mass incarceration prison slavery possible today. They give cover to this system of neo-slavery.
I am seeing a lot of Black women on Twitter give the Cosby Poundcake Speech to justify Kamala Harris's record of putting parents in jail for a child's truancy. Can we finally admit that classism exists among Black People?
@karenhunter @SuperLowBudge What consequences, a beating or as we say, a whoopin. You do know they locking up parents for disciplining their children right? I can not, yes I can, that people are making excuses for the prison pipeline to push some career cop.
@karenhunter I am going to tag this post as #blacklivesdonotmatter and as evidence of that caste system among African Americans with some looking down on and shitting on the poor and their struggles. Lets just round up everybody in the hood and lock em up so they don't embarass uppity Negroes
@karenhunter My mother worked first shift when I was in highschool during my sophomore year, I missed 40 days but still made the honor roll, my mom had no idea I was skipping school that much. So are you saying she should have been locked up because of a rebellious teen bigger than her?
@karenhunter Your question is vague on parenting. Also, it wasn't just people in poverty that were targeted and you should check out some of the stories of those who were impacted. I don't want to assume anything but you seem to be riding into that Cosby pound cake speech territory.

Same with prison overcrowding being ruled unconstitutional by the SCOTUS. Now she said in 2016 she is against private prisons but as AG to comply with SCOTUS ruling she contracted with the GEO Group to house prisoners, did not work to release low-level prisoners. #prisonslavery
You are either uninformed or lying on @rolandsmartin about she never pursued death penalty cases. Maybe not as a prosecutor but when the courts ruled Cali's death penalty was unconstitutional she argued to uphold the death penalty. She could have recused herself or not defend it.
Also speaking to "prosecutor's job is to uphold the law of the land" concerning Harris. We have seen prosecutors across the country refuse to prosecute misdemeanor marijuana possession cases so Harris does not get a "just doing my job" pass for those prosecutions.

I would discuss Brown in the context of after she broke it off, she threatened to prosecute that Black man over alleged corruption and he never was charged and convicted by anyone, but she failed to root out corruption in her own Prosecutor's office even defending tainted cases.
After a Twitter conversation I would advise activists not to bring up Harris history with Willie Brown in a sexual context even though that is an element of their relationship. Why? Because you will be called sexists and she will get to play the victim when she victimized so many
@Bayethegod I agree, he prefaced his comments by saying "right wingers" which isn't a revelation but why is that controversial to say? I need more information, not enough in this video.

@SarcasmStardust I would only apply that label to people who defend Trump's behavior or silent about it but want to bring up her sexual history like @TomiLahren
@SarcasmStardust She was vitrolic when at a church campaign event when first asked about Brown during her very first campaign. Now it is being brought up since she is running for President and depending on who is talking and why, I would not dismiss them as "garbage". Its a legitimate concern.

@SarcasmStardust Ok, we can just end this conversation because you are getting personal and my facts come from Big Willie's op-ed so perhaps you need to do some fact checking on this but again, you don't seem think extra-marital affairs matter but the people it does matter to are "garbage".
@SarcasmStardust It seems you don't have all the facts if you call an extra-marital affair "dating".
@SarcasmStardust Willie Brown was and still is married with children with his old sorry ass. She did not "date" him, she was involved in an extra-marital affair with him. Is "dating" how they are trying to spin it? üëåüèø
@SarcasmStardust It is not a rumor, Big Willie Brown wrote an op-ed admitting after questioning by reporters. Curious you would say people are garbage if they bring it up but people who cheat in marriages or fuck with married people are not garbage? Interesting. ü§î
@SarcasmStardust I know a lot of Black women would not have supported Obama at the level they did if it had come out that he had cheated on Michelle. If he did it now, people would be all over him about disrepecting his family and the other woman would be scorned. People hold marriage as sacred.
@SarcasmStardust Let us not act like people on the left don't do it too. A person's moral compass matters to a lot of people as a moral compass play into all your decisions. I would not call ppl "garbage" for it. Ppl can change of course but in politics, you know this stuff will be brought up.
@rolandsmartin @ChronBrianSmith @AntDavis23 It ain't personal, its long term business. Franchises dump or trade players all the time so turnabout is fair play as they say.
Yall can pretend all you want but this stuff matters to some people and don't think Hillary Clinton's personal life in how she handled her own husband's cheating and alleged sexual assualts, did not turn some voters off who voted 3rd party.
While I choose to focus on a candidate's policy record I think it is hypocritical to declare Harris's sleeping with a married elderly man, Perhaps for career advancement, off limits when for 3 years we have been hearing people criticize Trump for cheating on his wives.
@SarcasmStardust I think personal lives do matter to a lot of people. I mean if not why people make a big deal out of who Trump cheated with or if a Russian golden shower tape exists and how many times he has been married? Dems talk about it all the time in how he is an immorral man.
This is why I call on @KamalaHarris, @TulsiGabbard, @JulianCastro &amp; @ElizabethWarren to lay out an issues section on their websites instead of giving us bios, photos, donate buttons and hats for sale. Or am I wrong for expecting this so early in the campaign season? https://t.co/oo1Atnfr8I

@RickRosendall @michaelharriot Did they also cook up her Super Predator comments about non-white children while pushing her husbands mass incarceration bill? Did they cook up her comments about lazy single mothers in supporting cuts to social programs?

@Blaq_Ninja Oh I agree we need to build up our political power but it can not be just based on a person's skin color, where they went to college or what sorority they belong to. They have a record that speaks to justice. I just ain't into supporting people based on superficial qualities.
@Blaq_Ninja You ain't calling no one out because you know don't me or my years of work in letting the world know that the 13th Amendment does not abolish slavery and I be damn if I support the candidacy of someone who defended a system of prison slavery. Come off the BS cause I ain't the one
@Blaq_Ninja So stop acting like criminals are not doing harm to people but I'm against her based on her policy decisions and she has been on my radar for years because I produce a radio program called New Abolitionists Radio and helped fund the Millions For Prisoners For Human Rights March.
@Blaq_Ninja I don't "like" Brown, I don't dislike him either but he ain't running for President. BTW, a black man beat up my daughter, young men asked me for permission to kill him, I told them no, let the court system handle it cause you don't get to go to jail for his crime.
@Blaq_Ninja Can you talk to me like you have some sense. Brown ain't running for Prez, she is, and her record matters. Is there anything you don't understand about that? When he runs for president then his record will be thoughly examined like hers.

@Blaq_Ninja I'm a Black man who has lived long enough to put my thuglife days behind me. You a dumb ass on here attacking Mr. Brown in defense of a woman who refused to get people out of prison when ordered by the SCOTUS to ease overcrowding. You might live long enough to mature one day.
@michaelharriot So you must be rolling with Kamala "Top Cop" Harris huh? Dude you are a joke who is better suited for writing comedy skits than providing political commentary pushing those white liberal establishment talking points. Since when is gender a qualification Mr. Misandrist?

When the US govt decides to overthrow a nation by force, Black soldiers don't get to stay home. They get killed and maimed like everyone else, they kill and maim ppl so I ought to have some opinion about that. And when those political/economic refugees come here, we are affected.
Any Black political commentator telling Black folks to only concern themselves with issues related specifically to "black issues" is shallow and not considering how we have Black people in Congress who are voting on issues that impact the entire world.

@shannonrwatts @rolandsmartin So a politican's record should not be examined and critiqued if they are Black or are women? This is why people are so uninformed about a many things. If a person can't stand to have their public records examined and debated then perhaps they should not run for office.
I called it days ago, I said any legitimate criticism of Kamala Harris's record will be labeled by the establishment as sexism and/or racism. Certain charges like sexism, misogyny and white supremacy are becoming trite. They are used to deflect criticism and its sickening. https://t.co/9xMdYnYJiL

I don't rely on others to tell me what I should think. I do the research. Trump doesn't have me scared and in my feelings.
@ktjazz14 @rolandsmartin Sander's hasn't even announced and here is a Black media outlet, not corporate media, but Black media nonetheless coming up with some BS attack on him. Watch all these Black media outlets get in the bag early for that prison slavery proponent Kamala Harris cause they suck.
@ktjazz14 @rolandsmartin Really is it nonsense or did Donna Brazile give debate questions to Clinton and got fired for it? Every corporate outlet that panders to Black people was on Clinton's bandwagon. What got Trump elected is he ran against a terrible candidate who ran a terrible campaign.
@SenatorMenendez Did Congress ever authorize US troops to invade Syria? I don't think they did so you are in support of colonizing other nations with no regard for their soverignty. Let the Kurds, who have always been represented in the Syrian govt work with that government to secure Syria.
@rolandsmartin It was evident Black media was in the bag for Hillary Clinton, who can forget her domino playing hot sauce comments on the Breakfast Show. He was part of that NewsOne/CNN Debate you were on and we know why Donna Brazile got fired. Come on bro!

A politician's character is measured by their record on the issues.
Highly offensive to the legacy of Shirley Chilsom to link her to @KamalaHarris's campaign for president. It is superficially suggesting they had the same political record and agendas. Dr. King said to judge people by the content of the character, not by the color of their skin.

@Corey1911 @seemeblaze No it is not a valid point. It was part of the strategy of Black segregationists to belittle, criticize and make it seem like the civil rights movement was about something that it was not about. Malcolm X came around to support Dr. King and said everything he wanted was right.

@ALAINACAIN @RealDLHughley @IAmSteveHarvey @TheEllenShow @TMZ @Ginuwine Listening to you, one would think hourly employees were getting golden parachutes or something. Its discounted service because they work for the company. Whether they get discounts or not, you still going to pay what you pay.
@ALAINACAIN @RealDLHughley @IAmSteveHarvey @TheEllenShow @TMZ @Ginuwine You name call because you are immature and not able to communicate in a clear concise manner. I also question your command of the english language as being wise or prudent has nothing to do with your whining and complaining about how a company compensates its regular employees.
@ALAINACAIN @RealDLHughley @IAmSteveHarvey @TheEllenShow @TMZ @Ginuwine Not once did I call you out your name, curse or anything of the sort, I questioned your logic but you want to talk about "people skills"? Pay your bill and stop complaining or find some service you can afford rather than blaming employees for getting benefits.
@SheriffClarke @rolandsmartin So did he plant that dead baby in your jail or the body of that man your deputies and you deprived of water till he died?
@ALAINACAIN @RealDLHughley @IAmSteveHarvey @TheEllenShow @TMZ @Ginuwine The only fool in this equation is the one complaining about employees getting a perk from a company they work for. If a company could not afford to give employees discounted phone plans they would'nt.
@ALAINACAIN @RealDLHughley @IAmSteveHarvey @TheEllenShow @TMZ @Ginuwine Your 360 Million dollar figure is based on flawed logic. Employees don't pay the same as the customers unless they want a upgraded plan. Geez, usually ppl complain about businesses not looking out for their employees.
@ALAINACAIN @RealDLHughley @IAmSteveHarvey @TheEllenShow @TMZ @Ginuwine What do you mean opportunistic? When you apply for a job, do you ask questions about employee benefits? Most businesses operate this way, give employee discounts. You just sound bitter about a bill. You can cancel your service but all companies give discounted plans to employees.
@Corey1911 @seemeblaze Excuse me for thinking for myself, having knowledge about the history in question and asking questions to determine motives. I just found it kind of funny to see a clip of Malcolm X talking about someone being brainwashed while he was being brainwashed, which he later admitted.
@Corey1911 @seemeblaze Being a student of Malcolm X's life and transformation and the pro-segregation propaganda he put out which he said, was not his thinking but what he had been taught should be questioned as people use his sound bytes from one era of his life in promoting what he later denounced.
@seemeblaze Is this before or after Malcolm X admitted he had been brainwashed and was not thinking for himself, you know after he started his own Mosque and founded the OAAU?

They have a better safety net than most people.
@Revive_POC @Tksosincere86 @tlspolitics_ This came out yesterday and you will find old articles saying the same thing during past shutdowns.

@jsharum @Abnasty210 @CastrolGTXX @pdxlawgrrrl @shaunking I don't have to be a cop to know anything about policing just as I'm sure other ppl don't have to be veterans of the military to know about the rampant sexual assualts in the military. Comparing the annual body count of US cops vs all other nations isn't a matter of opinon.
@Abnasty210 @jsharum @CastrolGTXX @pdxlawgrrrl @shaunking Statistics show there are more than a few bad apples and really bad ones end up as heads of the Police Union. No other cops on the planet find it necessary to kill as many people as cops here do every year. When cops do stand against corruption and dirty cops, they are targeted.
@jsharum @CastrolGTXX @pdxlawgrrrl @shaunking People understand what cops face, however, it is when cops murder people and use excessive force and have discriminatory predatory policing for profit policies, people are not willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. IF the details are true, I don't blame the cop.
@pdxlawgrrrl After reading the story, IF everything is true, the woman tried to help by offering $10 for transportation. Andre ran into the woman's home when police arrived to help, he fought, got tased, got up and pulled a knife at which point he was shot. Unfortunate series of events. üò¶

@Revive_POC @Tksosincere86 @tlspolitics_ I think people are harmed by the US govt whether it is partially open or not.

@moorhsumluvher This film had a release date set well in advance, people have been talking about her case for years with celebrities speaking on it. She has been fighting for years in the courts but we should believe that the governor watched a film yesterday and that's how he made his decision?
Apparently, it is true thanks to her and her team and those who lent their voice towards obtaining her freedom.
@moorhsumluvher I would say no, she has had a very strong advocacy group lobbying on her behalf for a number years. I would not be giving credit to Lifetime or a movie for her release. Those who put in the work deserve that credit and of course she deserves credit herself with her attorneys.

You are a victim of programming like the rest of the masses as Malcolm X so aptly put it. You want Roland to be on somebody's plantation to entertain you instead of building a Black media outlet.
@MommaTNYC @rolandsmartin @FoxNews The Deep State is just a metaphor for think tanks and non-governmental influencers and policy dictators. It also refers to the bad actors in intelligence agencies. They used to call it the "shadow government". What are you saying you don't believe bad actors are in the government
@ajamubaraka I would call that ideological progress. Pioneers are often unrecognized until their ideas become mainstream.
@MommaTNYC @rolandsmartin @FoxNews All news on MSM is scripted to present a heavily partisan viewpoint based on their political ideology, this is an industry fact. The controlled opposition is on their so the network can claim to be "fair and balanced" when everyone should know they promote white nationalism.
@MommaTNYC @rolandsmartin @FoxNews Look lady, whoever you are, I have been studying this industry and its the focus of a media non-profit I started 10 years ago. I know people who have been on there as I stated, I know every year Black people lose their positions on MSM. He isn't the only one w/ industry knowledge
@rolandsmartin @MommaTNYC @FoxNews You have to make that decision for yourself and what you can acccept in a contract but I hope it in no way impedes your work with your own media company. Black Jouranlists should serve the Black community and less than 4% of Black ppl watch Fox. F Fox and its propaganda.

@LancasterGreens @ajamubaraka Banning private prisons is a step towards abolishing prison slavery but it still leaves in place the facilities run by the federal state and county govs. The Green Party National leadership has not made ending Prison Slavery via the 13th Amend a plank in their national platform.

@FilmCriticOne I have the whole story. What I don't need is the spin, how you going to spin that "your eye only" letter to Stephens? Or his commentary that Blacks are inferior and can not co-exist with whites in the US and his support for shipping them to Africa? I read alot, stop the BS.
Very disappointed that anti-Black male racism and misandry seems to be accepted by Black people in the Twitterverse. I had to write about it and this was before the R Kelley doc came out which I did not watch because I don't watch drama on cable tv.
@FilmCriticOne Obviously, you are fanatic for Lincoln and want to deny his racism even though these things are documented, I suspect you of practicing racism yourself.
@FilmCriticOne @LSafare If you read the 13th Amendment, you would see the compromise on slavery within it he made with the South and hence why I am a modern abolitionist. The US did not obtain the world's largest prison population by accident. It was 150 years in the making. You should do some research.
@Sciencelyfe @rkelly Perhaps "we" meaning whoever watched the lifetime doc, because I sure did not because I have no interest in such things, but why do "we" keep watching and helping the cable networks make money off controversy because thats what "they" do.
@Sciencelyfe @rkelly It is my observation that children and feeble minds are easily distracted. When I watch a sporting event on tv for an hour or two, it does not distract me from the social political things I will research that day and perhaps produce a podcast on.
@Sciencelyfe @rkelly I have to ask you who is "they" which I think is cliche' and a trite term. There are millions of things going on simultaneously, I wonder how "they" are controlling everything and how everything is some sort of "distraction".
@AmirAminiMD Obama said Libya is his greatest mistake. That was totally a Clinton operation and she used it as a photo op to portray herself as being a strong leader. She violated US law calling for Ghaddafi's killing. Libya gave up its WMD quest, became an ally in 2005 &amp; he got killed for it
@FilmCriticOne I haven't touched on his racism, today he would be called "white supremacist" who wants deport all Black people to Africa. He had to be persuaded by Delaney, he ignored Douglass call to enlist Black soldiers and because they were losing to the South. Lincoln has been whitewashed.
@FilmCriticOne Are we going to deny he was a colonizer whose adminstration was violating treaties with tribes and when they retaliated, we hanged in mass on his order? "Largest mass hanging in United States history 303 Indian males were hanged" https://t.co/KAscg2aDFn
@FilmCriticOne How was Lincoln kicking "slavery in the ass". By giving political speeches to attain the support of abolitionists in the Republican Party.

@LSafare Yeah I'm not calling her out specifically, I never learned these things in school. I only learned them once I became a modern abolitionist after reading the 13th Amendment and then started researching Lincoln. I was never taught the 13th Amendment never abolished slavery in total https://t.co/uP75V7bMEx
@jarrod_tweets @WSJ Russians say they caught him in the act. I don't know how their criminal justice works but wondering when the detailed allegations will be laid out. I think it is totally possible he was a spy and not just for one country, could be a free agent selling secrets.
There much myth surrounding Lincoln. A radical? He was a moderate abolitionist at best and a compromiser at worst. He said he was ok with slavery as is and it was never his intent to interfere with the South's "property". He was also a colonizer who had Native Americans killed. https://t.co/vvHESERKbM

@JMLewter I agree, people however misuse this concept in illigitimate commentary on Black folks. I know he is a Obama fan and since he did not say so, would like to know if he was applying that to her book commentary on Wright and other elders.
@JMLewter If the person prefaces their comments by starting off saying "Let me set myself apart from other Black people" is another matter. Context is everything, he provides none, I put it into contextual terms but I know a lot of Obama fans will disagree with that.
@JMLewter I am critiquing because it is an example of how all Black people are not the same. Lots of black people think like the Obamas, a lot don't so since there is no central body that represents Black people, how can one set themselves apart from Black people. It is illogical.
@mic857 @politico You know its foolish to call people fools and then cite some fake history using the race card to try and confuse me by getting me into emotions.

@mic857 @politico I did not know there was evidence of 78,000 Russian non-citizens voting in the 2016 US election. No Clinton private server with classified information, no investigation into that server. If Trump is "illegitimate" then you must believe Biden illegitamately certified the election.
@mic857 @politico Really, you want to compare the Electoral College to black people being kidnapped, raped, beaten, starved, killed and forced to labor for free? Umm. I don't know if you ever read the 13th Amendment but it doesn't "abolish" slavery. https://t.co/4HhuDbYv0K
@JMLewter Setting themselves apart from the Black Liberation Theology of their former Chicago Church and its leader to appeal to more Americans is exactly what the Obamas have engaged in. We are not like our cranky grandparents who grew up during segregation she says in her book.
@JMLewter So you believe all Black people are the same? There is nothing different about us as indivduals? That sounds just like something a racist white people believes. All Black people are violent criminals or on welfare or eat chitterlings or vote Democrat?
@Beth_Bankston @mbspiritradio I also understand how time-consuming Black hair can be for some Black Parents. Especially when it came to little girls. You can get what, 3 or 4 days, sometimes longer out of braids whereas today, people use weave on children to save time in doing their hair every day.

@riotwomennn @politico @natashakorecki uummm read the article, it talks about policy and other factors concerning the electability of someone. I saw nothing wrong with the analysis but plenty wrong with the knee jerk reactions to a writer writing about a political candidate.
@mic857 @politico But she didn't win the electoral votes as prescribed by the Constitution and lost in a landslide because millions of people across the nation didn't like her and still don't. Deal with it. However, Warren is certainly more "likable" than Clinton.
@politico I see nothing wrong with this headline or article. Sick of the fake outrage claiming sexism whenever a politician is critiqued. Every potential voter doesn't like Warren because of some of her votes, not what is between her legs. You ppl are freaking sick.
The reaction to this story about a "female" candidate by a "female" writer is ridiculous.

@KamalaHarris Define "assault rifle". All rifles sold to the public function the same, the only differences are cosmetics. The federal minimum age to buy a rifle is already 18, if you want to go higher then ban 18 and under from the military. UBC is reasonable. Bumpstock ban was reasonable.

@ajamubaraka So explain why the National Green Party Platform is resisting the demands of the New Abolitionists Movement against prison slavery? At least Sanders and progressives want to abolish private prisons &amp; other reforms, we will keep pushing them on ending legalized slavery in the US.
@ajamubaraka I mean in the real world, I have yet to see a party platform that aligns with my views 100%. I know some SC Greens that I supported adopted prison slavery abolition to their personal platform and supported removing the 13th Amendments allowance for slavery.
@ajamubaraka Sen. Sanders has been pushing for his popular domestic policies for over 30 years so that's a dubious claim he and progressive adopted the Green Party platform. I only voted for Stein because my choices were Trump and Clinton. But I also see a lot of progressives who are antiwar.
@SarcasmStardust Furthermore, how does that line work with Independents who are the real swing voters? The only reason I voted in the NC Dem primary was to support Sanders. In the past I have voted for Ron Paul in Republican primary because of policy. Corp Dems act like criminal gang members.
@CNN Trump frequently bashed Republican candidates who were not 100% down with his agenda. Hell, he gloated ove Mia Love losing her seat and he never campaigned for "Lying Ted Cruz" although Cruz still prevailed over Beto who voted w/ Republicans against his own party in Congress.
@CNN "Donnelly said the President made not voting for Republicans seem like a personal betrayal by voters." So here we go with the same line Hillary and her surrogates used to alienate voters saying women who don't vote for Clinton are "traitors".  Of course, she lost too.
@CNN "When asked if Democrats could be viable without appealing to interior state votes, Donnelly replied, "I don't know how you do that." So why would anyone listen to you especially since you lost?
@DemPartyExit @amikegreen2 @xks2012 No one should be trusting anyone especially politicians of any party however pressure must be applied on all fronts to advance desired legislation to produce the desired results. People should be in support of policy over cults of personality.

@Toure So it has nothing to do with US-backed overthrows of their nations because they chose leftist governments that reject capitalism? What about the destabilization of the Drug War. And if that "US aide" was benefitting them, then why are they leaving. I've already dropped clues.
@Toure So what do you think about the Israeli's wall that US taxpayers are funding and where is the Democratic Neo-Liberal opposition to that? For the record, I don't support building walls, I support tearing them down.

@jimsciutto The Syrians and their allies are more than capable of cleaning up their on nation of DEASH. This sounds like a person who just wants to kill Muslims. Its their nation, their responsiblity. This guy needs to stfu and follow orders but I think you making this person up.
@jimsciutto What is his name or are you making it up? I distinctly recall no one being concerned about how allies viewed the US after it turned on the Ghaddafi government to side with terrorist and overthrow his government.
The war hawk conservative General Matthis has the distinction of being possibly the only general fired by two Presidents and removed from his post.
@jelani9 No we can't agree but can we agree that Clinton ran a racist campaign against Obama and it was her campaign that started birtherism. See some of us have memories that go beyond 2 years.
Only later did I learn that war was started over bullshit lies too but upon death, both Liberals and Conservatives held that criminal George HW Bush up as some kind of hero.
It ain't that hard to withdraw 2000 troops. You drive to them to the airport and you fly them home. It ain't that complicated and I was part of the 500,000 troops that deployed during the Gulf War and came home when the job was done.

@TLoc55 @Ali_H_Soufan @DebraMessing @NBCNews I would have wrote my own name in before casting a vote for Hillary Black &amp; Brown Children Are Superpredators so lets incarcerate them all or women on welfare are lazy.

@Wolf61010 @DarkGently @Ali_H_Soufan @NBCNews A Billion dollar war chest, an army of trolls, most of MSM in the bag and she still lost. I saw plenty of Clinton ads on social media, I was sick of the "I'm With Her" campaign. Clinton lost because of her terrible political record and this propaganda isn't changing that fact.
@lil_brown_bat @BordeleauCody @GOOHWTBS @Ali_H_Soufan @AndyRichter @NBCNews Yeah the Russians are why Hillary did not bother to go to those states to campaign. Like was said, I was never going to vote for Trump or Clinton and the assertion that third party voters were under Russian influence is pure fiction. I voted for McKinney in 2008 but blame Putin.
@SenSchumer Did you say this when Obama fired Mattis for wanting to use military force against Iran? You do know he is a war mongering NeoCon but I guess there has always been bi-partisanship between them and Neo-Liberals.

@EinekleineTweet @SarcasmStardust @jimmy_dore @YouTube Why don't you post a link to your source that the Kurds are being exterminated and where was this sentiments about betraying allies when Obama and Clinton helped Jihadis overthrow Libya after it became an ally in 2005? Look at Libya now!
People talking about the Syrian pullout leaving Kurds all alone would send a wrong message to "our allies" but Turkey is a NATO Ally of the US. However, where was this sentiment when Ghaddafi's Libya was a US ally and helping capture Jihadis but Obama and Clintion had him killed?
So Obama fired Mattis because he wanted to use Syria as a jumping off point to attack Iran and more than likely did not support the deal Obama and other nations brokered with the Iranians but all these liberals acting like NEOCON Mattis was so great. He is a war profiteer.

@sahouraxo Actually I remember a huge pushback by citizens to invading Syria but some of those same people today want the troops to continue the illegal occupation.
Then these people want to move the goalpost from ISIS to Kurds, again, where is authorization from Congress or the UN? You don't care about the Kurds just like you don't care about the Palestinians being oppressed. It is nothing but political posturing &amp; fake concern about pawns.
Now those same people being hypocrites because its Trump fulfilling a campaign promise to bring them home from these costly military interventions that seem to always destroy infrastructure so corps can come in and make $$$ rebuilding what was destroyed by the US military.
I remember the media got in a frenzy over Syria &amp; alleged chemical weapons use and the "military experts/defense lobbyists" called for an invasion &amp; then a huge number of Americans protested and called Congress and said no to invading Syria and Obama sneakily did it anyway.
I believe Trump did communicate his Syrian &amp; Afghan withdrawal to Mattis who did not agree and got fired.  As some Congress members said, Congress never authorized boots on the ground in Syria and there was no UN Security Council Mandate, therefore, it is an illegal occupation.
@NBCNews Chickenhawk bullshit and warmongering from a corporation. The mission was to get Bin Laden and Al-Qeuda, Obama said "we got him" so why are our troops still be killed and maimed all these years later? This is childish and an affront to members of the military.

@JailLawSpeak I produced @NAREndSlavery for 50 weeks straight we examined every State constitution live on air, we found the slavery as punishment exception clause in 46 states. Do the research then you will know what I am talking about.

@realDonaldTrump I think Americans in Charlottesville, Pittsburg, Jeffersontown and several attempted bombing victims would disagree that you are doing anything of the sort. The exact opposite would apply.
@BreakingBrown @realDonaldTrump Little known to the masses who don't know American history, Black American men were making the same complaints about the waves of poor immigrants coming from England and Ireland to take jobs from them. I wonder if they had torches chanting "you will not replace us"? Doubtful.
@BreakingBrown I can have that conversation with him since his family can be traced back to the colonial period but @realDonaldTrump don't get to have that conversation being a 1st generation son of immigrants who came in well after the 14th Amendment. Deport him and his extended euro-family.

So if you out here arguing the intent of the authors, which I don't care to hear, just know that they did not intend for your European parents and grandparents to get US citizenship by way of the 14th Amendment because that is what you are arguing.
In fact, these European immigrants did just that and once given the political status of "white", they more than went along with racial employment discrimination against native-born US citizens that was legal until the passage of the 64 Civil Rights Act.
In fact, some African-Americans did not support the hoards of European immigrants being brought into the country and naturalized as citizens seeing them accurately as being brought in to replace them as the number one labor force in America.
If the authors of the 14th Amendment intended for only the victims of slavery and their descendants to be granted birthright citizenship, then that means that 90% of "white people" in the US today should lose their citizenship including the entire Trump klan.

@msmarypryor Voting did make racism and other forms of discrimination illegal and why people, companies and government agencies can be sued for practicing racism. Of course, voting has no impact on the religion of "white supremacy" and who believes in it so that is not really a revelation.

@Donk3yKR4P @RealTimBlack @kanyewest Faux outrage saying he wants to abolish the amendment that abolished slavery when if that person had researched the 13th Amendment, read it, they should know that the 13th Amendment did not abolish slavery but created a new form of slavery they call "mass incarceration".
@Donk3yKR4P @RealTimBlack @kanyewest Exactly @Donk3yKrap, as if people don't misspeak at times and like you said he almost immediately corrected himself but hey, don't focus on the issue itself, prison slavery legalized by the 13th Amendment, focus on a mistake to pile on him because you don't like the other stuff.
@ABC7Chicago He "perceived" a threat that other officers did not perceive and I did not perceive watching the video. What is he really saying, that cops can go around killing people based on "perception". I perceive Jason Van Dyke to be a threat to citizens so does that mean he can be shot?
@kgosztola But what about the 1st Amendment and freedom of the press? Isn't this a public trial? Correct me if I am wrong? I thought this was a public trial that the public has an interest in. This judge needs to be the one charged with contempt of the 1st Amendment.
@MSNBC @realDonaldTrump perhaps you need to apoligize to the Central Park 5 and how you presumed them guilty, polluted the process with your NYT ad basically calling for a lynch mob but let a white male you support face allegations and now you talking about a "difficult time"?
@SlaveryPrison @thumblesteen Very disappointed in what I am hearing and I would add that I had complained about BAR not doing enough to the support the prison strike with media coverage.  I don't get this criticism, it is illegitimate. Local people did support the strike, held demonstrations. This is garbage
@SlaveryPrison @thumblesteen I need to listen to the podcast but going on what was written, it seems to me if those orgs were in regular contact with prisoners then they would have known about the upcoming #prisonstrike. I mean several organizations were involved. I will listen to the podcast.
@RealTimBlack @kanyewest Yes, I wish he had not misspoken the first time and he did correct himself and millions of people are now looking at the 13th Amendment for the 1st time and perhaps realizing we are not dealing with "Mass Incarceration" but rather a continuation of slavery as stated in the 13th.

@jelani9 Jill Stien was closet to my ideals hence my vote for her. Your whining about the Clinton losing to Trump and blaming people for not supporting who apparently you supported is weak ASF and reactionary.
Blaming those who did not support Hillary Clinton for Trump is some reactionary BS. Do you know that some of the issues brought by prisoners in the #prisonstrike came as a result of Clinton approved criminal justice reform? Hillary was Bill's co-president and supported it all.

We built this damn country, in fact if not for Black soldiers, the US would not even exist. I read alot, others should too.
@MikeJ20325828 @VonniMediaMogul @stabyoulots In fact, in the 1800s and early 1900s, Afro-Americans were complaining about all the european cheap labor being brought in to replace them as the primary workforce the same whites are complaining about hispanic refugees today.
@MikeJ20325828 @VonniMediaMogul @stabyoulots The Japanese Americans got reparations for their short period of interment, Native American tribes got reparations for some things, European immigrants got stolen land handed to them, interest free loans and a lot of perks denied everyone else including African-Americans.
@MikeJ20325828 @VonniMediaMogul @stabyoulots Falling behind, when have things ever been even? We are 150 years out of pre-American civil war slavery, still the number one target of prison slavery and segregation only officially ended in 64 on paper. These things matter.

@kzshabazz Ok, no disagreement there, I don't think that was your main point, you made a specific speculative comment about "if he was white". He wasn't white and he is dead at the hands of an off-duty slave catcher who has been charged. There is nothing to speculate on about that fact.
@rustbeltradio There were an esitmated 19,000 enslaved Africans in the 1600s. That number exploded after the slave codes were put into law. I am not aware of any other instiution outside of slavery in the Americas that enslaved people by the millions.
@rustbeltradio People should do what they think is best to end the system of slavery. Death By A Thousand Papercuts is what I say but in terms of my strategy, get the exception clause removed, then that will open up some legal avenues to end the practice in the prisons. Pending Revolution.
@kzshabazz It is speculative, you said who has any doubt that if he was white he would have not been killed. The fact is, white people kill white people every day, it doesn't get a lot of press in a system pushing anti-black racism just like cops killing whites doesn't get a lot of press.

@rustbeltradio Yes some things have changed. We no longer have to give seats to white people in the US, no "whites only" public facilities. However, Slavery has only changed by making the owners of human "property" government and coporate entities thus a need for the New Abolitionists Movement.
@rustbeltradio There was no institution in the British colonies in the 1600s holding "millions" captive. Further I don't see what that has to do with my comment about the introduction of institutional racism model created by the Virgina Slave codes of the 1600s and 1700s to preserve slavery. https://t.co/7RcyXg4f5J

@KamalaHarris Hope some of them will be slavery abolitionist moving to remove the exception for Slavery and Involuntary Servitude from the 13th Amendment and focus on the demands of the #prisonstrike. California even reports profits from prisons. We remember your comment on cheap labor for CA.
I don't subscribe to prison abolition, all of these are branches off slavery, slavery that was never abolished.
