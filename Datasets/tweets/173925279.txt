Democrats reject backup plan to fund government if border talks fail https://t.co/XzxZupeZoy
I don‚Äôt agree with this. HOUSE Democrats introduced it on 1/31 as their starting point. But the bipartisan bicam talks are much different in how they strike deals. Snag means Dems made ICE detentions a demand in those specific talks over the weekend. https://t.co/2gBAhJBV0e
Hi Roger. It‚Äôs not my idea. I‚Äôm explaining the Democrats‚Äô argument which Guy asked about and which I cover. https://t.co/hSgaHr9bu0
From negotiator and Dem Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard: 	"Right now, the Trump administration is pursuing an out-of-control deportation policy focused on removing immigrants with no criminal records, many of whom have deep roots in their communities. This approach is cruel and wrong https://t.co/tksdKZJXNJ
Great question. Democrats want to limit detentions because they don't believe non-felon illegal immigrants should be detained. They say it is inhumane treament and that most are not felons, most are not dangerous. They can be monitored, not detained. https://t.co/HKyWELfnQN
And GOP opponents say this would limit ICE. Say they reach the cap in August, then they would no longer be able to detain even illegal immigrants proposed of felonies. Democrats scoff at this and say there are no where near that many felons - most are detained for illegal status. https://t.co/8NXDeezOdU
No. They want to reduce the number of all detentions overall - combining those accused of felonies and those here illegally with no serious criminal charges, under that limit. Dems propose a 16,500 limit on the "average daily population" in detension centers now till end of FY 19 https://t.co/NaEY0PLeze

@MarkDice Thanks! We wrote that Burge tweeted it. We weren‚Äôt sure of authorship.
Democratic argument: Their proposed cap would force ICE to focus arrests on felons and not those who are illegally here but have committed no crimes. https://t.co/EahDnQ2TjF
Spending talks collapse over demand by Democrats to curb ICE detentions https://t.co/dG3En3KJz4
Spending talks sticking point: House Democrats want to statuatorily limit average daily population in ICE detention centers to 16,500 for remainder of fiscal year. GOP opposes limits and argue it would curb their ability to nab and deport illegal immigrant felons.

@jimantle It takes that long to wipe it from memory.
@rkobell Sure. But also apply that standard to some amazing crap run by big media using anon stuff. Later retracted. That was my point.
@asifintoronto What? You are nutty.
@rkobell I agree mostly. Sometimes needed. But at least an idea of the source affiliation.
@TheJournalizer You need to do some reading apparently
I‚Äôm not ‚Äútrying‚Äù to pivot to anything. I was specifically talking about the hypocrisy of criticizing anon sources. Read the thread before you assume ridiculous crap. Or, stick to your own nasty bias. I guess that‚Äôs what Twitter is for. https://t.co/arwJWWrM1M
@rkobell I can only suggest you do a bit of research on anonymous sources and retracted stories and see how media outlets stack up. Otherwise you are just lobbing silly insults that miss the point.
@JessicaHuseman And, it appears you are blind to it based on your tweets. That is the point I was making. Perhaps to complicated for twitter.
@JessicaHuseman There are serious consequeces to that, too.
@JessicaHuseman Because (Gina Haspel) Pro Pub and other News Orgs (countless)  don't help the dishonest narrative with "ocassional" shoddy reporting that gets widely circulated with corrections that few see.
@JessicaHuseman No. YOU lumped it all in. I was pointing out serious problems with anonymous sourcing in mainstream media - used all the time, including at your own publication (Gina Haspel anyone?) that have had to be retracted. Am I wrong, shall I send you links?? That is what I meant.
@JessicaHuseman You can have last word if you want, I've got to check out for a while...
@JessicaHuseman First, I never equated all anonymous sourcing so what are you taking about? I pointed out the frequent use of anonymous sourcing by the mainstream media in very consequential stories that is widely accepted despite spotty accuracy.
@JessicaHuseman Hey no need for the name calling and clearly, clearly you have absolutely no clue what I mean. Probably because we are all wedded to our own view on this issue - which after all, was my point to begin with. P.S. I gotta go actually write a daily.....
Are you arguing that the anonymous sourcing has been used responsibly by the mainstream media? That's simply not true. Are you arguing that the use of anonymous sources that were wrong has not had serious consequences?  That's also not true. https://t.co/fMbT3CQTaD

@LewisUnderscore Bias, not insight. Re-read the thread.
@marconi64 You make my point. There are biases abound so choosing one side as "wrong" while accepting another.. we need to question all of those sources and their motives. From my vantage point in DC - politically motivated anonymous sources are rampant.
Brave and thoughtful response. https://t.co/MK33hIeSRC
I have no idea - my tweet thread is about anonymous sourcing and the widespread use of it by many media outlets with varying degrees of success and failure and how personal bias influences our acceptance or rejection of anonymous sourcing. https://t.co/e5yYUpi7dB
I admire your faith in the mainstream media. https://t.co/gOAmgaAw4G
Candidly. No bias. While the ranchers you assume are racist and dumb. So flip that around. A lot of people believe these government sources harbor biases and motives leading them to leak to the press. I can assure you, many anonymous DC sources have political motives. https://t.co/j3mHAvas4c
Sure - how about an anonymous government source hell-bent on stopping the Trump agenda, or the Democratic agenda, or whatever, disguised as a good-government anonymous source. Ok with you? That's employed quite a bit by mainstream media. It goes both ways. https://t.co/GWGRwpntgP
Call it good or bad - but trashing anonymous sourcing is the height of hypocrisy when it has been relied upon by the mainstream media for stories that have been questionable or later proven false, and that have had major impact. All of it requires more scrutiny and consideration https://t.co/X0a2uMHWaa
What's the anonymous source's motive? Good government or politics? Can you be 100 percent sure? 	Do you trust the lead reporter, who has run into trouble with past stories?  Did you even know that? https://t.co/niwEwhNG4y https://t.co/gIjZwsYcY8
And, on some occassions, these anonymously sourced scoops produced by big media outlets have been dead wrong. People take sides on the issue of anonymity based on their own personal bias. The trouble with anonymous sources in government is it also hides their pollitical motives. https://t.co/uEiblB9F73
All of these dozens of comments confirm what I said  - If you agree with the story, then the anonymity is ok, it's justified. Big media outlets rely frequently and lean heavily on anonymity for scoops.  If you hate the story, then anonymity is not justified and story is "bad." https://t.co/2R8vOZzTeI
Mainstream media has led the way with anonymous sourcing, single sourcing, claims with no viewable evidence. It's "very bad" if you disagree with the story. https://t.co/rKDv8xsiWa

If Senate remains stalled on the House bill, they could try to passing the spending bill with the $1.6b for border security/wall that Democrats backed in the Appropriations committee in June.  Ten Democrats voted for it in committee.
This vote on the spending bill requires a majority of those voting to proceed to the measure, not necessarily 51 votes.

@ChuckLane1 The AUMF.
@kimoco @Austan_Goolsbee That's not true. There are climatologists who disagree. They are often shunned /ignored. That's not right.
@bleiby527 Why thank YOU!! And please stay in touch with me!üòÄ
@antitrumpactive @Austan_Goolsbee Ok. How about Judith Curry? Or follow @ClimateDepot or @ClimateRealists. They link to research/articles.
Do also sent this criticism to the news outlets who write nothing but negative stories, ok?
@bleiby527 St. Louis is urban no? Also, what's the harm/ fear in Salena writing positively about Trump when he's criticized in other media.
@bleiby527 I hate to break this to you, but that is exactly what other reporters are doing when they write pro-Obama, Anti-Trump.
@antitrumpactive @Austan_Goolsbee That's just untrue. Truthful debate about this issue has been shamefully blocked thanks to politics.
@bleiby527 Other journalists never wrote a single word against Obama. Did you criticize them? Point is, Salena brings balance to the media.
@antitrumpactive @Austan_Goolsbee Since you are so impassioned and say you are a true scientist, what's the harm in reading other views?
Ok, I was going to ask you why you didn't vote for Trump! Never mindüòÄ
@bleiby527 Then, aren't others just journalists for Trump opposition?
@bleiby527 You are making my point - mainstream press goes out of their way to hunt down Trump opponents. Who is there to voice other views?
@bleiby527 Are you working class/rural and did you vote against him?
@bleiby527 Anti-Trump voices get no shortage of coverage and attention, even rural and working class. Trump backers largely ignored.
@antitrumpactive @Austan_Goolsbee No, there is great science that disputes what you say is indisputable. It gets buried, condemned.
@bleiby527 Well, the other side... I assume you are referring to non-Trump backers? I see lots and lots of that coverage.
@antitrumpactive @Austan_Goolsbee A phony number and it stems from money, funding and politics. It's not truthful and masks truthful debate.
@mattmfm Here is something from a recent Wash Post article about polls: "actual GOP voters are still very much onboard the Trump train."
@bleiby527 No, a well-reported story that gives a voice to real people who are often ignored by mainstream media.
@Austan_Goolsbee A lot of credible scientists do disagree. I guess they are not credible. Or not credible because they disagree with you?
@rickklein @HotlineJosh Pence felt deceived/burned by Flynn over Russia sanction talks with ambassador.
@dalewrites83 @RyanLizza Yes because majority often needs 60 in senate, which causes them to use procedural gymnastics.
@betterstrangers @POTUSPressPool @juliemason Yes. As will GOP. Same as when Dems/Obama passes health care law.
@ChairMissing you are pretty reasonable, especially via twitter standards!!
@ChairMissing Indeed!!!! But I do appreciate the convo! See we can be civilized and not always agree!
@dalewrites83 @RyanLizza Ok, so if Republicans "refine" Obamacare with reconciliation, which is what some are saying, same thing right?
@ChairMissing It was not minor. Today, it's contorted to look minor and media mostly plays along. Dems used reconciliation. Period.
@ChairMissing From the Law Library Journal "The ACA is composed of two separate pieces of legislation."
@ChairMissing perhaps take a look at bill text. Lots of significant things in it. 	Point is, Democrats used reconciliation to pass Obamacare
@ChairMissing Right, but a significant part came from a second bill. Not just minor tweaks. I think, over time, it's been contorted.
@dalewrites83 @RyanLizza No really it's not. Look up the law! Lots in there.
@ChairMissing No it's a new bill. Has a lot in it!  I think I sent u link. also you can look up name of law which I also sent to u.
@ChairMissing @RyanLizza In fact the two bills - together - are considered Obamacare. Disingenuous to say Dems did it without Reconciliation
@ChairMissing @RyanLizza Guys, here's a summary. I was here covering. These were NOT tweaks!!  https://t.co/1MFHrZAycm
@ChairMissing @RyanLizza Not true. Second bill had significant provisions in it, used reconciliation. This is a disingenuous argument.
@jhaverly It did. And it caused a lot of animosity and anger between the parties, as this maneuver often does.
@nmcrawford @paogilvie @RyanLizza @kairyssdal See my new tweet on this. 	This was no tweak. Made significant changes. Yes, I was here then!
Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 made more than just tweaks to the law. Those here covering at the time may recall.
@RyanLizza ACA is composed of two pieces of legislation. That is fact. They did use reconciliation for Obamacare. Perhaps I was dreaming.
@paogilvie @RyanLizza @kairyssdal They could not pass the original bill into law. That is fact. They used reconciliation to clear their bill
@RyanLizza Which is now law. That was the only way to pass it.
@RyanLizza @kairyssdal But, Democrats made the same argument- and choice -  with Obamacare.
