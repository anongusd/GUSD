Dear people reading this :obviously this will change, 2020 is a long way away and I just got bored (see my full ratings pinned in my profile (they will change too (again, just bored.)))

@realJacobGerard @FrankLuntz That‚Äôs... not what I said

@Polit_eurOpines Just a hedge. Could be close, SC Gov was semi-close, and Cunningham won.		Also I'm really betting on that LA twist for a fully Democratic south by 2038
@Polit_eurOpines I guess I'll go through each one-	LA- Pretty Safe unless Kennedy wins Gov and JBE appoints himself or another Dem for Sen, which makes it ~tossup.	MS- Safe unless Espy wins, which isn't likely but isn't impossible	AL- Doug Jones	KY- Could get a strong candidate against MM
@Polit_eurOpines go ahead
I like it when you all challenge or ask about my predictions. It forces me to think harder about each race and be able to justify my ratings. Please feel free to comment on all of my predictions.
@lennysundahl It's likely R at best
@ChazNuttycombe I had Tilt R right as I was about to send the Tweet but changed it to tossup at the last second because of how many non-safe GOP seats there are
@ChazNuttycombe Probably, but maybe not depending on candidates/retirements. These are pretty early and will def change

@brodiedduncan Senate is on the verge of Tilt R for me. I chose tossup just because there are lots of non-safe R seats that *could* flip.	As for President, I'm keeping tilt R until we have a D nominee. D Primary voters might make the wrong choice (aka Warren)

That was... quick
Jeff Sessions has resigned
While moving Florida's panhandle to Alabama would've helped Democrats last night, it probably would've meant Senator Roy Moore.
@IAmKrishanPatel @politicsluo She's down by 1%, but there could be a recount.
@aps5521 It‚Äôs possible
Running some *rough* numbers, it looks like Democrats got around 48% of the total House vote in Georgia. Here's what that would look like under a fair map. https://t.co/yjCwQZDqEf
In GA07, the race has been tightening for a while with each new dump of votes. It's not clear how many votes are left, but the consensus is that they're from areas closer to Atlanta. Woodall currently leads Bourdeaux by just 890 votes. Likely recount here. 2/2
Diving back into the GA House races here. In GA06, McBath looks like she's defeated incumbent Karen Handel. However, she's winning by 1%, which is also the margin for a recount. Interested to see how that plays out, but I'd much rather be McBath. 1/2
Again, I‚Äôm new to this, so I could be wrong. This is just what I‚Äôm seeing.
... Instead, I think that Abrams just didn‚Äôt focus enough resources in this area. The places where she really pushed, Atlanta and the suburbs, she overperformed. There just wasn‚Äôt as much energy in the black belt. 2/2
So, what‚Äôs the reason behind her underperformance in the black belt? Well, while the black belt is Democratic, it is also very rural and more conservative than outsiders may think. Could it be that Abrams was just too liberal? It‚Äôs possible, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs likely... 1/2
(If you wanna see the primary turnout map, just look at my profile pic üòâ)
As an example, take a look at Burke county (circled). Dems had more primary votes there, and I expected Abrams to carry it by over 10%. She narrowly lost that county. https://t.co/NaWgaeaJwF
... but overperformed in the suburbs, especially Gwinnett. That overperformance, however, didn‚Äôt make up for her poor showing in the South. I‚Äôve marked on the CNN map:	1- Where she underperformed based on my map (black)	2- Where she overperformed based on my map (green)		2/2 https://t.co/XP1DHlZnEn
On the backend here, I actually made a map a few days ago of what I thought a slight Abrams victory would look like. I‚Äôm not releasing that map (yet), but I compared it to the current results. Abrams didn‚Äôt get what she needed in the black belt... 1/2

Update in the 7th: Woodall now leads Bourdeaux by only 299 votes. This race is going to be close.
Update: Things looking better for Democrats in GA06 and 07. Kemp's margin has slowly been decreasing.
@deedahnjr @elium2 I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs unlikely but not impossible with absentees
@haydenrobinsonn @elium2 That could be enough
@DrewSutton20 My projection based off of where the outstanding votes are.
Projection: Tester has defeated Rosendale in MT Senate.
@dcastillo82 @AschConformity_ That‚Äôs a glitch. But I know as much about absentees as you do (aka the SoS isn‚Äôt sharing info)
@MRKruge @numanmyname Iowa and Georgia will be tough, but it‚Äôs possible
@TossupReport @phanthanhtom @karandikara18 @ChazNuttycombe @spartand34 Ladies and gentlemen, the United States. https://t.co/qmGZyyp6xa
@BrianCollinsMO This was surprisingly close.
@TossupReport @phanthanhtom @karandikara18 @ChazNuttycombe @spartand34 , you know what to do.
Alright so when‚Äôs the next Texas poll
If after last night you think your vote doesn‚Äôt count, I want you to take a look a Georgia. 2 Congressional races here are being decided by just a few thousand votes, and our Governor race could go to a runoff depending on a few thousand votes. Every vote counts.
@dcastillo82 @AschConformity_ I can‚Äôt tell you because the SoS isn‚Äôt sharing how many absentees are left and where they are.
@GAprogressive15 Most of Fulton is in now, but the SoS won‚Äôt tell us how many absentees remains and from where.
@elium2 Have any idea how many votes are left in GA07? Looks like too big a margin for Bourdeaux to overcome.
Dems can have a majority in the Senate in 2023 if they do everything right.
Can someone familiar with North Carolina explain what happened there? From what I can see it looks like Dems did pretty good in the state legislature.
@AschConformity_ It‚Äôs possible.
As more votes come in, Kemp‚Äôs total slightly ticks down. Now at 50.4%.
Morning update: Lamont has taken the lead in CT Gov. The remaining votes are mostly out of New Haven, which should vote Lamont.
Morning update: with more votes counted, McBath now leads Handel by 1% in GA06. Brian Kemp is sitting at 50.5%.
I‚Äôve been awake for 21 hours. I‚Äôm getting some sleep. But trust me, I‚Äôll have a lot to talk about tomorrow, including my analysis on Abrams‚Äô performance in the black belt. Love y‚Äôall.
That‚Äôs it for tonight. The Gov race could still go to a runoff, and GA06 will almost certainly go to a recount.
Looks like it will be a while for AZ and MT senate. I‚Äôm going to bed.
@phanthanhtom (Hurd is leading again)
@TFenton54 I can‚Äôt say for sure yet, but keep in mind it used to be favoring Sinema.
@Nate_Cohn CNN has Hurd leading once again with 102903 votes.
@ArmyHRguy Hurd now ahead.
Ortiz Jones is no longer ahead of Hurd.
Maricopa is now tied with 87% reporting. #AZSen
MI06 is still only at 58% reporting. Upton leading by 3%.
A lot of close House races in Texas. You know who to thank.
It appears Ortiz Jones has defeated Hurd. #TX23
My head hurts so much. It was worth it though.
Wow. https://t.co/SnWl0tfect
Anyone have any estimations on how long it will take in AZ and MT? I want to get some sleep.
After looking at where votes need to be counted, I think Lamont will win in CT Gov.
Just projected by CNN https://t.co/Ahca49bAbu
Sisolak is a heavy favorite in NV Gov.
Rosen has defeated Heller in #NVSenate
GA06 results: 50-50, Handel leads by a handful of votes. Will almost certainly go to a recount.
Evers has defeated Walker, for now.
RT @RalstonReports: Rosen and Sisolak are going to win.
Kemp‚Äôs vote total now down to 50.7%. Still a little left in Gwinnett, and then absentees.
The rest of Fulton just came in, and Kemp‚Äôs Martin went down by... .1%. No comment here.
Joe Cunningham has defeated Arrington. If you followed my tweets (hint hint), you‚Äôd have known I thought this race would be closer than most expected.
Huge margin in Clark County https://t.co/Qe2BbgST87
@KyleKashuv @FBI Hey, congrats Kyle. I know you‚Äôre excited about the Florida wins for Republicans.
RT @RalstonReports: Clark in, big leads for Sisolak and Rosen. This is almost over.
Actual big if true https://t.co/F6avL5A2qe
Folks, this might be going to a runoff, in which case, everything changes.
@ElectionFan1 This is... surprisingly accurate
Alaska at-large looking close, but Young is up 6% with 18% reporting.
This + what we've heard in Clark County is what makes me think Rosen will win. https://t.co/VWKDtRVKQZ
I know many aspects of tonight may be disappointing, but please don‚Äôt kick yourself for it. You alone can only do so much.
Based on what‚Äôs left in Arizona, I think Sinema is a favorite.
I think Rosen is a favorite in NV Senate.
Abrams: ‚ÄúTonight we have closed the gap between yesterday and tomorrow. But we still have a few more miles to go.‚Äù
I should note... I'd rather be ahead with 99% reporting, rather than hoping for a runoff. I still think Kemp will win, but it's possible he loses.
That was scary lol https://t.co/LljW8kI7pY
This seems a bit early https://t.co/NsOpFQOzi9
Alaska results coming in.
Abrams is not conceding the race. Her campaign believes Kemp will not get above 50% after all votes are counted. Only 83% reporting in Fulton county.
@AgentCoopr702 @IAmKrishanPatel Trump lost CT
Gosh I lost like 5 followers tonight
Really looking like Lamont will lose CT Gov
Noem has defeated Sutton in South Dakota.
The 538 model actually did pretty good tonight.
Nevada coming in
Eventually we were going to lose these red state Dems. Disappointing it was today.
Gianforte looks like a favorite to win re-election with 61% reporting.
I do not think Democrats will take the Senate in 2020.
Sad night in GA.
Handel has won GA06.
Woodall has won GA07.
It appears Cunningham‚Äôs lead is growing with 91% now reporting.
I am crushed right now.
Imagine thinking Bourdeaux had pulled off a major flip in your neighboring district then realizing the numbers were wrong.
@haydenrobinsonn Damn @BrianKempGA
@LikeIGive_Adam Though I was right, none of us got 600 by last night going by EST
Guys... still need to beat Adam to 600 followers. https://t.co/BkUqoq6Acb
@LikeIGive_Adam Shit
It appears Bourdeaux did NOT win GA07. CNN posted incorrect numbers for this race.
@Redistrict @CookPolitical Numbers just flipped on CNN
I take this back. CNN may have posted incorrect numbers. https://t.co/SH6aD2baKU
Wow. Looks like there may have been an error in GA07.
While Abrams may lose, you have to thank her for carrying Dems to victory in GA07 and possibly GA06.
Slightly disappointing result in the rust belt regarding Governor races
A close race in MN01. Few Han leads by less than 1000 votes with 83% reporting.
@JakobDWebster King won with 53.3% per CNN numbers
Missed it but Slotkin is now leading in MI08 with 95% reporting.
With 89% reporting, Cunningham has taken the lead in SC01. I marked this as my sleeper race a while ago.
Looks like there could be a recount in GA06. Handel leads by 169 votes with 99% reporting.
Bourdeaux has won in GA07.
@SenhorRaposa @rudnicknoah wow
@SenhorRaposa @rudnicknoah The race hasn't been called yet, right?
With 72% reporting in SC01, Arrington is leading by 3 *votes*.
With 97% reporting, Bourdeaux is maintaining a 4% lead in GA07. I think she wins.
Looking like Reynolds will win Iowa Gov.
With 44% in, CA25 is tied 50-50.
Fitzpatrick has won in PA01, marking the final race. PA House makeup: 9D-9R.
Just hit me that Bill Nelson will not be returning to the Senate.
Currently a 2% race in SC01. This is the race I was stressing would be closer than expected. 61% reporting.
In IL13, Londrigan is no longer projected to flip the seat as it is too close to call with 95% reporting. Davis has a 2% lead.
Projection: Brian Kemp has avoided a runoff and defeated Stacey Abrams in the GA Governor race.
Throwback to when the 538 live model gave us a 40% chance of flipping the house.
With 46% reporting, Upton has taken a slight lead in MI06.
@politicsluo He might‚Äôve lost if he voted no on Kavanaugh
@politicsluo Holy shit yikes
Gianforte takes the lead in Montana AL
I missed it but Dems have flipped TX07.
I think Watkins has it in KS02
Haven‚Äôt gotten an update from CT Gov get, but worth noting Lamont is currently losing by 7.
To everyone who trusted my Senate predictions: I‚Äôm sorry. I missed a lot of close races, and they all add up in the end.
@joncprevo Might delete the tweet just for this tbh
A few days ago I said keep your eye on SC01. With 61% in, the Republican is leading by 4%.
69% of UT04 reporting, McAdams has a healthy lead.
Can‚Äôt find the tweet, but I remember @aseemru telling me to remind of his prediction: an 8% win for Steve King. It might be half that.
UT02 is surprisingly close with 46% in.
I said that a boost in the black belt would give Abrams a win. I think I was correct in that. She's currently not getting that.
Orange County, CA area is starting to report.
@decunningham2 Congratulations I think you got it
47% in and Hegar is leading Carter in TX31. @kkondik was right to mark this as possibly competitive.
@DrewSutton20 Wow
This isn‚Äôt an exaggeration, this really did stun me https://t.co/ToLtocnrWw
Dems flipped IL-13 and it went pretty unnoticed.
Press F to pay respects to Senate Dems
@haydenrobinsonn It‚Äôs true
Have word that Horn (D) has won in OK05. Was likely R.
@Gains__ Especially starting out by losing Florida
@IAmKrishanPatel Love it
Not gonna lie. I got really scared early in the night. But we have the House.
Wow. DeWine has defeated Cordray.
Watkins just took the lead in KS02
@HenryLavinder I think she might win as well
While we‚Äôre all here, I would appreciate some help to get to 600 followers üòâ
Remember how we all said KY06 wouldn't be an indicator of the night? Yeah we weren't kidding
Williams looking good so far in Montana.
Is Spanberger projected to win yet?
@DemocraticLuntz Yes, though it might not be enough
You guys don‚Äôt live in Georgia so you can‚Äôt relate but I‚Äôm so excited that Bourdeaux might win.
Looking like Dems will win at least 3/4 House races in Iowa.
65% reporting in GA07 and Bourdeaux leads by 5%. I think she wins.
@politicsluo @joncprevo ?*
@politicsluo @joncprevo You think Longjohn will win&gt;
People were asking for possible surprises tonight. Well, there are about a thousand of them.
Okay Michigan twitter, explain MI06 to me please. @joncprevo @politicsluo
97% in and Horn is leading Russell in OK05
Shoulda polled GA 07 @Nate_Cohn ... just sayin (although there a LOTS of surprises here)
About 50% of GA 07 in, and Bourdeaux is still leading. Kemp is leading statewide, and I think he ultimately wins. His strength came from rural areas, where he got huge margins with turnout to back it up.
Democrats have won the House.
"Read tomorrow" https://t.co/5yOPUWncr5
Iowa is reporting, if anyone cares at this point
And don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not going to bed until 2 am at the earliest
One thing‚Äôs for sure: I‚Äôm gonna have a lot to look at tomorrow morning
Luria has defeated Taylor.
Actually what the fuck is happening
RT @kylegriffin1: NBC News: Laura Kelly projected winner in Kansas governor. Kris Kobach goes down.
Can someone familiar with Ohio tell me who the favorite there is for the Governor's race?
Feeling way more confident about the House than I was a while ago. The Senate, however, is gone.
@McF_Nbctoday @JustCameron__ Yes
Just went to look at NYTimes House needle and saw the Senate and nearly shit my pants. I thought the House was 95% GOP for a quick second
@JustCameron__ literally could care less at this point. I need good news. (Also they give Nelson 55% chance of winning)
THANK GOD https://t.co/VNlmi8WHKu
NYTimes corrected the numbers. 10% in, but Bourdeaux still leading. McBath is also leading in GA 06.
@politicsluo It is. Sadly it is overshadowing some good performance in other Gov races
If the NYTimes numbers are correct, things are looking good for Carolyn Bourdeaux, who is up by 12,000 votes with 90% reporting.
Some good news: Looking good for Kelly in Kansas
Abrams doing well in Gwinnett, but Kemp is doing well elsewhere. I'd rather be Kemp at this point.
Marsha Blackburn has defeated Phil Bredesen in TN Senate
Kemp is overperforming in a lot of the rural areas. Abrams isn't yet where she needs to be in the black belt region. However, we still have very little Atlanta reporting.
My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined
https://t.co/yjHFXAw47R
RT @Redistrict: #KY06: Rep. Andy Barr (R) defeats Amy McGrath (D). GOP hold. This district voted for Trump 55%-39% in 2016.
Someone tell me it's gonna be okay
@McF_Nbctoday Donnelly just lost.
Senator Joe Donnelly has been defeated in Indiana.
If you can't tell I've gotten pretty quiet.
@LikeIGive_Adam 63.9% chance we flip it.
@LikeIGive_Adam The 538 live model gave Democrats only a 40% to flip the House for a little bit

I'd rather be Braun than Donnelly at this point
So we gonna get that needle or...
Representative Jennifer Wexton
Still not enough data to make any analysis here.
I'd much rather be D than R right now
Projection: Wexton to beat Comstock in #VA10.
I was wondering when my stomach would start killing me. Glad to know you're still there.
This is a good result for Dems so far https://t.co/f85WvL5kcF
Next polls close in 3 minutes
Looking good for Florida Democrats.
@politicsluo I'd think. But who knows, could be something.
I'd rather be McGrath than Barr right now
Very probably nothing, but keeping my eye on FL-02. 40k votes in, Dem with 56%. Safe R district.
I won't be going in depth in a lot of races, mostly because I don't know their geography. I'll be discussing GA a lot though.
Tim Kaine projected to defeat @CoreyStewartVA in the VA Senate race.

Before y‚Äôall unfollow me over this (some already have): I don‚Äôt support Wardlow at all. I want him to lose. But I can‚Äôt support Ellison either. If you still wanna unfollow me, go ahead. https://t.co/eeIekRyqDa
@rivercityleo I understand what you‚Äôre saying. And trust me, I hate Wardlow and don‚Äôt want him to win. But think about the message that‚Äôs sent if a man can abuse a women and then get elected to office. Not liking Ellison doesn‚Äôt benefit me at all. You can disagree, but don‚Äôt call it selfish.
Told y'all https://t.co/5tpX1NNvse
*whispers* 	I'm ready. https://t.co/yhNvHZYB84
It's possible that the GOP keeps the House. It's also possible that the Democrats flip 58 seats. It's also possible that the Demcrats flip exactly 23 seats. A lot of things are possible, but I'd *much* rather be a House D than a House R.
Just remembered I was supposed to change my profile pic today. But I kinda like the new map...
The 2022 midterm is the first major election I can vote in.
@Gains__ That's not what I said and you know that.
@rivercityleo .. Can I get an explanation or just something more than this?
@Gains__ They're moderate/liberal Republicans. Their states' legislatures are Dem and they're liked by the voters of their state. They deserve to win.
@shan_ye_cun_fu I think I would too.
@rivercityleo ?
@karandikara18 @IAmKrishanPatel Yes we do
@phanthanhtom Oh yeah, forgot about that. I want him to win
@karandikara18 @IAmKrishanPatel You're right, I don't have a choice. I can't vote. Which is good because it means I'll never have to make up my mind for this race, NJ Senate, and a few other races.
@karandikara18 Trust me I don't want his opponent to win either. I'm really not sure what I would do if I could vote in Minnesota
@IAmKrishanPatel I don't want Wardlow to win. I also don't want Ellison to win.
While I'd be fine if they lost, I want the Republican to win in: VT Gov, MA Gov, MD Gov, and maybe a few others.
Democrats who I want to lose: Keith Ellison, Archie Parnell.	Democrats who I want to win: Everyone else. (Incumbents in CA 2-Dem races)
@_alex_joshua Really not sure how I‚Äôd vote if I lived in New Jersey and could vote. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not in that scenario.

@joncprevo Okay ‚ÄúJon‚Äù
(Thread here: https://t.co/pw8HKa35j9
Going into tomorrow, I think John Barrow (D candidate for GA SOS) is a favorite. This is because of the help of Abrams, as well as him getting better margins in his old district. I wouldn't be surprised if he lost, but I don't think it's likely.
@nolesfan2011 If that‚Äôs the case I don‚Äôt think it would be enough.
If I had to summarize, I‚Äôd say:	1. Look at rural turnout. GOP needs more than just good margins. 	2. Look at black belt turnout. This will ultimately carry Abrams to a victory (if she wins)	3. Look at the margins in the Atlanta suburbs. Abrams needs to overperform Dem candidates
(This will be my GA thread tomorrow)
Also note Abrams over/underperformance in GA06/7. She should be overperforming the Democratic candidate in both if she wants to win. Gwinnett County should be a good indicator, but with a noticeable D Lean. It won‚Äôt pick the winner, but it‚Äôll show how close the race is.

Another thing to look at: Kemp may get a larger than expected % in rural areas, but turnout there may be lower. This was seen in the OH-12 special - R‚Äôs overperforming %-wise in rural areas, but not getting the turnout to make it meaningful. https://t.co/jLSsPoSAiF

Watching results in GA, look not only at the margins in and around Atlanta, but also at turnout in the southern black bet regions. If Abrams wins, I think it‚Äôll be because of heavy turnout there, rather than good results in the suburbs (Though suburbs will definitely help).
@gelliottmorris I‚Äôd like to see an in-depth look at GA voting demographics, particularly what % of the electorate are black voters and how heavily they vote Abrams. Interested because of the extent of black voters in the Alabama senate special.

RT @RalstonReports: Final Clark from Friday: 48,000 voted. Dems added 9,000 (!) to firewall in the South, which is now about 47,000.
@Polit_eurOpines @phanthanhtom iirc @ForecasterEnten did a thread about Dem performance in GA runoffs a while ago
@WinWithJMC do you have any numbers on this?
@jiminyjobbers55 @RalstonReports ... which is good for Dems going into Election day, especially with Washoe County being close. Sisolak isn't a guaranteed bet, but I'd rather be him than Laxalt at this point. 2/2
@jiminyjobbers55 Well, polls have been tight but also consistently shown Sisolak leading. Also, Nevada is one of the few states where early voting numbers are useful, and so far it has shown a Dem firewall nearing 40k votes in Clark County (thanks to @RalstonReports for these numbers)... 1/2
@Mike_Stankiew about 30% iirc
Something I've been struggling with: what % of the GA electorate will be black voters?  Most polls use 30%, but I've been thinking for a while it would be more like 35%. That's the difference between a slight Kemp win and a slight Abrams win.
#NVGov Tilt R -&gt; Tilt D. I was probably wrong to put it as tilt R in the first place, but it is now clear that Sisolak is a slight favorite.
Two scenarios here. The first is a map where it looks like Republicans are keeping the House early on Election night, but ultimately lose. The second is where it looks like Democrats are on their way to a large number of flips, but ultimately take the House narrowly. https://t.co/fJVCG1JTrp

I just noticed that the Fox News ratings don't have any safe options. The max they go is likely. That makes for a very odd prediction when you actually have likely races and safe races. Like, Wyoming Gov is safe R. You shouldn't have it at likely when South Dakota is also likely.

@phanthanhtom I watched 2 seasons then got upset when Rachel and Ross broke up so I stopped lol
I think a lot of people are going to be dissappointed when Texas results come in. Possible that Dems don't flip a single House seat and Beto loses, though the latter is to be expected.
FiveThirtyEight's classic model no longer favors KS02 to flip, though it's still a tossup. I think it's going to flip, along with KS03.
What should I watch on Netflix I don't wanna keep watching The Office and Parks and Rec

As promised, my House ratings: https://t.co/oD3TNvBhXO
Please read this reply, they point out what I didn't explain in the first tweet. Please don't read my tweet as meaning Democrats are favored to win 1 Safe R seat. These are not uncorrelated, this was just a fun thing to do when I was bored. https://t.co/nX3XdGCLQi
@AsInMarx ik, I mentioned that in another tweet. I was just doing this for fun
@AsInMarx No, I had to manually calculate it. https://t.co/TGoS7kfVZB
@McF_Nbctoday They're favored obviously in every individual seat, but if you take the combined probability that they win every one of them, it's 49%. However, that's treating each race individually and doesn't take into account that what happens in one race could be a nationwide occurrence.
Using current 538 Classic numbers, there's a 49% chance that Republicans win every single seat currently rated as Safe R.
@niles_francis @haydenrobinsonn @CobbSchools Yeah
@politicsluo For a lot of politicians, ‚Äúcareer politician‚Äù means a career of trying to better their community. I respect that.
@IAmKrishanPatel @MonmouthPoll @DanaRohrabacher @HarleyRouda @FiveThirtyEight Do you think Dems will sweep that area? I could see them maybe losing 39

@Polit_eurOpines @reesetheone1 I think Barrow is more likely to win than not. Also more likely to win than other statewide Dems because of his old district.
@Polit_eurOpines @reesetheone1 Same
@politicsluo I‚Äôm just not comfortable putting it as safe yet. It‚Äôll probably be there Nov 1 when I reevaluate tho
@politicsluo https://t.co/JaNLh3ezK6
@politicsluo I knew someone was gonna say that and I have no real defense of Likely D other than I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs *safe* *yet*
@TaylorDesloge I would be happy with this night. We really can't do much better in the Senate. I could see Cordray winning tho
@ElectionFan1 Tilt ratings are so close, so I can understand flipping all of them. Cordray *might* actually be favored, but to be safe I put it at tilt R. Could change when I reevaluate (Nov 1)
C+ Pollster, but poll came out today with Abrams and Kemp both at 48%. Net result is about Kemp +1. This has always been a tight race and I think it'll go to a runoff.
@JacobBrahm In this scenario moderates become VERY powerful
Wildcard: Where possible, individual delegations are also split.
@TossupReport When does it start?
House delegations are split 25-25. The Senate is split 50-50. The VP is an independent. In the latest election, the Democrat gets 269 EV and the Republican gets 269 EV. Wtf happens now.
@phoenix_fieri TBH without that poll it might be likely R. It was a close poll but doesn't out weigh the other polls. Plus TN is just so red.
Updated Senate and Governor predictions. House coming later. I think the most likely outcome is a 50-50 Senate and 25-25 Governorships. https://t.co/LtCyI14bOW
@LikeIGive_Adam John Barrow has a good chance of winning. If you‚Äôre just doing women tho, Stacey Abrams ofc
RT @HeidiHeitkamp: I've always pledged to be an independent voice for ND. That‚Äôs why I took on my party to protect our gun rights &amp; reign i‚Ä¶
@ChazNuttycombe And I would be happy with that outcome
@politicsluo Also pretty nice a tie is 269-269
@DylanDevenyi @politicsluo If the Senate is tied could the current VP essentially pick the next VP?
Winning individual state House delegations is underrated. They are extremely useful in the event of an electoral tie.
@ColtonMLong The 0ptimus model
I have a hard time believing Republicans only have a 5% chance of keeping the House. There‚Äôs a lot of possibilities where they win.
@phanthanhtom @haydenrobinsonn Might? 2. Will? Probably 0.
@TFenton54 Bad. She needs to be winning by around 3 points here

Just noticed this on the @0ptimusPredicts House model, the D+R seats for any given scenario is = to 436 seats. For example, 218-218 is a scenario that apparently has a 1.3% chance of occurring. 4.1% chance it's 236-200.
Hot take: we should increase the House to 2000 members so we can have more upsets on election day

The best way I can explain probability is this: you‚Äôre in a class with 9 other people. Each time the teacher randomly calls on someone, you have a 10% of being chosen. However, you‚Äôre still chosen every once and a while (~1/10 times). This is because 10% does not = 0%.

@LikeIGive_Adam 2 would create a new court for businesses, which I think is unnecessary because they can use the current court system. 3 would change the tax system for timber lands, which I think could support deforestation and give unneeded benefits to companies
@gregrossindy @NateSilver538 @kfine39 Alright, that‚Äôs district 5. Here‚Äôs the link for that, you can scroll down to see polls and fundamentals. https://t.co/2azbpNns2z
@jordantart @NateSilver538 IIRC, the average population is the states population x the % chance the party has at winning there. Whichever state is at the end of the Dem bar in the first graph gets notes competitive, thus giving a greater % of their population to Rs.
@gregrossindy @NateSilver538 What district are you in?
@Taylor_Nick_L @NateSilver538 Tilt is closer to tossup than Lean
@LikeIGive_Adam Some of them could could be misused (B could be, but I think the benefits are more important), and some like 4 can actually increase the problem (I think the ACLU spoke on 4)
@LikeIGive_Adam 1 is just using taxes for conservation, which is fine. 5 is optional for schools to change local taxes, and B makes it easier for mentally disabled people to buy houses. The rest are either unimportant or have flaws
