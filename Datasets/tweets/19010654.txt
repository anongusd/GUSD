Go all in to create a more gender balanced world. @JackiZehner
Use financial rewards we buy things from you or we buy things from you.Do not buy from companies with no women on their boards
Choose financial institution with women on boards.
First thing we can do with money is to invest it in what you care about  	These men and women at wmm investing with gender lens.
Women investing in women and engaging men on gender equality. 	Jacki Zehner.
Technology ultra violet.  Non profit. 400000 men and women working on gender equality.
More male champion leaders like Warren Buffet ! Go Warren! Greater gender equality will not be achieved without men's support.
Narrowing gender gap makes sense economically. Having women on Boards makes sense economically. Jacki Zehner.
There is no good reason why we as women are not working to close the gender gap. Economically makes sense business sense- gender equality.
Women's experiences are marginalized 	Why we continue to see gender inequality as a problem? Not gender equality as an opportunity?
