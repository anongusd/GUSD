Hey #Baltimore and #DC peeps! Want to hear @EugeneCho speaking about Justice As Mission? Join us at https://t.co/GYXTeagUyi on Sat March 23! It’s one of the few church-centric, justice-oriented, Baltimore-focused, POC-led conferences I know! #Ethnos2019 #EugeneCho #Baltimore https://t.co/aFKsHzkRCj
Look at these numbers of Syrian and Iraqi refugees resettled to the US over the past 3 years:	FY16- Syrian refugees- 12,587 / Iraqi refugees- 9,880	FY17- Syrian refugees- 6,557 / Iraqi refugees- 6,886	FY18- Syrian refugees- 62 / Iraqi refugees-140
So far in FY19, the US resettled a little over 7,000 refugees. Only 45 Iraqi refugees and 13 Syrian refugees have come in so far. At this rate, we'll only resettle 21,000 refugees out of the 30,000 refugee ceiling.
What a sad statistic- 1.4 million refugees are in need of resettlement in 2019 which means they cannot return home or locally integrate where they are. But just 4.7% of these refugees were resettled in 2018. Surely, we as the global community can do more? https://t.co/UKZRhuLU8M

According to @NPR the greatest predictor of those who try to enter the US from Mexico is the strength of the US economy #Immigration https://t.co/i3LOkxcFq8
Unauthorized entry into the US has steadily been declining since 2000. This year the make-up of those crossing the southern border without authorization has changed as well- from individuals to family units + w/ many coming from Cent. America not Mexico https://t.co/i3LOkxcFq8
There is a fear of people who are crossing the border but they're not a nat'l security threat they're refugees fleeing a humanitarian crisis in Cent. America, much of it fueled by previous US foreign policy/interventions. This is not a nat'l security crisis but a humanitarian one
The 4,000 people the administration references as people who intend to harm the US were not caught at the border but rather mostly at US airports #PresidentialAddress #TrumpAddress #Immigration
In fact, if we're really concerned about terrorism and national security, we should focus on the northern border where 41 people were caught in the same time period listed in the terrorist screening database
Here are the facts. There were only 6 people caught at the Southern border who are in the Terrorist Screening Database in the first half of FY17, not the 4,000 purported by the administration. #PresidentialAddress #TrumpAddress #Immigration https://t.co/B6867oKY9F

@rachelheldevans @LaytonEWilliams @Sojourners @MatthewSoerens We did launch the “I Was a Stranger” bookmark challenge which lists 40 verses related to the “stranger” in the Bible on a bookmark and asked people to read through it.

I put "threat" in quotes because the Pentagon found in its risk assessment that the caravan did not pose a threat to the US... and the deployment of troops had a potential cost of $200 million https://t.co/lojMrLswic

@MatthewSoerens Yes that’s right! She should be included in these headlines... and don’t worry I’m all about following and trying to influence politics from the outside, not the inside!
They are clockwise from upper left:  Sharice Davids (KS), Ayanna Pressley (MA), Ilhan Omar (MN), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY), Deb Haaland (NM), Rashida Tlaib (MI)
Them being the first “___- American” doesn’t sum up all of who they are, nor does it mean that I’ll agree with all their positions, but representation matters. I believe these women will bring a different dynamic, voice and experience to Congress.
These women are the first Somali-American, first Native American women, first African American from MA, first Muslim woman, and youngest woman ever elected to Congress.
I have mixed feelings about the election last night, but the fact that a record 89 women won seats in the House of Representatives, and that these women represent many firsts in Congress, means they are shattering ceilings, narratives and stereotypes of who can lead us. 1/5 https://t.co/o5Pd8te8IE

Even as the admittance of persecuted Christian refugees declined by 57% from FY16 to FY18, Muslim refugees have been more significantly impacted as there has been a decline of 91%
The Administration desires to protect persecuted Christians but only admitted 15,748 persecuted Christian refugees in FY18 vs 36,822 in FY16- a decline of 57%
Just an analysis of the Report to Congress that accompanied the FY19 refugee ceiling determination, every regional ceiling allocation (Africa, East Asia and Near East/South Asia) declined, except Europe and Latin America https://t.co/GgVKqAG0Wi
Also, the 30K refugee ceiling is the lowest in US history. The average refugee ceiling since 1980 when the Refugee Act became law has been 95K.
It’s official- the President signed the refugee Presidential Determination for FY19 setting the refugee ceiling at 30,000. So disappointing that we’re effectively shutting the door on refugees coming to the US at a time when there are the most refugees in the world #welcome75k https://t.co/kjXFFEYdez

Ironically, North Korean #refugees are not finding protection in the US. North Korea is one of the countries listed in the #refugeeban. In Q1 of FY17, 11 North Korean refugees came to the US. In Q1 of FY18, 0 North Korean refugees came to the US. #SOTU #SOTU2018 #NorthKorea

It’s just not true that a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives. The current family-based immigration system has strict categories of family members who can be sponsored and numerical caps on each category. #SOTU #SOTU2018 #immigration
I don’t consider brothers and sisters who are sponsored in our current #immigration system by U.S. citizens “distant relatives” do you? I would consider any sibling as part of my immediate family #SOTU #SOTU2018 #immigration
#ChainMigration is a myth. On average, an immigrant sponsors 3.5 family members, which INCLUDES spouses and children. If we're a pro-family country, we should reunite immigrant families quickly, not cut back family-based #immigration #SOTU2018 #SOTU https://t.co/k3hXW79oxK
