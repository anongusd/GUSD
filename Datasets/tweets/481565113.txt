@KingDareDK @1pissedPolack @libertythePD @senatemajldr Maybe.	But will he admit that, during his hearings.	He will probably just avoid the question. But if Democrats could get him to promise he won't block the funds, that would be great.
@KingDareDK @1pissedPolack @libertythePD @senatemajldr This is true. But nevertheless nominees tend to answer questions moderately. So I don't think Barr will testify he will end the Mueller investigation immediately. The more Democrats can make him promise he will protect it the better.

@Maggy92824460 @brianschatz Time will tell
@Maggy92824460 @brianschatz Yes, but if you have a three-way race for a certain period, the Democrats are likely heading towards a contested convention. One where on the first ballot no contender gets a majority. And then anything can happen.

@Maggy92824460 @brianschatz In 2008, there were only three candidates who got delegates. It became a two person race real quickly.	There is a significant chance this will be different in 2020.

@ESCochrane Technically this runoff election is part of the midterms.
@MAGAonthejob @mitchellvii You're wrong. It's Republicans who cheat with voter suppression and extreme partisan gerrymandering.
@xnx_lee @shelbyresident @mitchellvii For months the possibility of taking the House was indeed mentioned, but I am talking about before Trump.	Before 2016, few thought it was possible, and now it actually has happened.

@Varidienne @amjoyshow @JenKernsUSA @MSNBC I must say, I disagree with almost everything Jen says and she works for the Daily Caller, which is a racist publication if you ask me, but I do admire her courage for going to Joy's show.
@shelbyresident @mitchellvii And no, we don't accept voter suppression and gerrymandering for partisan purposes.
@shelbyresident @mitchellvii Did you accept it when Obama won and was reelected?
@shelbyresident @mitchellvii How come they lost the House then? With the second biggest vote difference in the last couple of decades.	And of course I hate Trump, what's not to hate?	His biggest accomplishment is blowing up the deficit to pay for a tax cut for the rich. Which will lead to an economic bubble.
@shelbyresident @mitchellvii It's voter suppression by Republicans that is the real cheating.	You could turn your statement around: Republicans can only win in rural counties, where no one lives, by making them afraid of immigrants who won't come to their community anyway.
@shelbyresident @mitchellvii And yes, the Republican Congresspeople who retired, because they were afraid to take responsibility after years of doing nothing but obstruct Obama, did help.	Or maybe they retired, because they were sick of enabling Trump's racism and corruption.
@shelbyresident @mitchellvii And I was sceptical every time.	The conventional wisdom was that it would be near impossible for Dems to take over the House after the redistricting of 2010.	Trump and this GOP are so bad, that it became possible in spite of the current map.

@howiesacct @hardcorerepubl1 @ScottOReilly1 @mitchellvii I don't like CNN. They hardly do actual reporting, most of the time it's just a Republican and a Democrat shouting at each other.	They gave Trump tons of free media during the election.	I like MSNBC.
@howiesacct @hardcorerepubl1 @ScottOReilly1 @mitchellvii Could you be specific and provide evidence for your claims?
@howiesacct @hardcorerepubl1 @ScottOReilly1 @mitchellvii Keep dreaming.	But funny how you think Comey is a hero of the Democrats.	Democrats and Republicans are united when it comes to Comey. Almost everybody thinks he was totally incompetent as FBI director.
@hardcorerepubl1 @ScottOReilly1 @mitchellvii LOL, what a snowflake: https://t.co/aN93jDfFNL
@shelbyresident @mitchellvii But I loved the outcome of the House election. Nobody thought it was possible for Dems to take the House with this map.	They got a historic popular vote win. A very nice pickup of a Senate seat in Arizona. They are now well positioned to take over the Senate in 2020 as well.
@shelbyresident @mitchellvii When elections are won by cheating, I have a problem with them. Like the one in Georgia, where the guy on the ballot was also the one purging likely Democratic voters.	&gt;
@hardcorerepubl1 That's rich coming from a Kavanaugh believer.
@hardcorerepubl1 @mitchellvii Avenatti is irrelevant. But the things that he helped uncover with Stormy Daniels aren't. Trump paid her off, for being quiet about the fact he had sex with her when he was married to Melania and she had just given birth. He also violated campaign laws in the process.
@hardcorerepubl1 @ScottOReilly1 @mitchellvii Ford didn't lie, and she is also not being prosecuted/charged with committing perjury.	Kavanaugh should be prosecuted. He as a senior was never legal to drink. He lied about people's recollection of that party. And much more.	https://t.co/G5xoXZXsQ3
@hardcorerepubl1 @mitchellvii Because it wasn't one of the women mentioned in the first place. Blasy-Ford, Ramirez and Swetnick all stuck to their stories.		Kavanaugh however went from the guy, who didn't have time to party to the guy who screams "I like beer", with a 'beautiful' calendar full of parties.
@hardcorerepubl1 @ScottOReilly1 @mitchellvii The Kavanaugh accusations were never properly investigated.	We do know he did not tell the truth under oath. When he was asked questions about this.		https://t.co/G5xoXZXsQ3
@hardcorerepubl1 @mitchellvii You seem worried.	You should be, Republicans abused their subpoena power as a weapon for political purpose.	Democrats now have the opportunity to investigate these abuses. Including making that fraud Whittaker acting AG.
@hardcorerepubl1 @ScottOReilly1 @mitchellvii You live in some freaky fantasy land. Keep dreaming.
@hardcorerepubl1 @mitchellvii Whittaker (with two Ts) is a fraud.	You are right about this, he was hired to terminate the Mueller investigation. Which in itself is an act of obstruction of justice by the President.	But don't be surprised if a judge rules he cannot be acting AG until he is Senate confirmed.
@Warwick31 @mitchellvii Time will tell. 	https://t.co/JkEifoTGYz
So he is now dictator of House Republicans too, @HouseGOP? https://t.co/VfCsBmAXPr
@mitchellvii Democrats won 7 of the 10 seats in states that Trump won in 2016.	They got a bigger popular vote for the House deficit than Republicans did in 2010.	I feel really good Dems now have the power to investigate all the allegations of corruption of this admin.	https://t.co/aHYGDHwm0e

@VanJones68 @realDonaldTrump Legalizing/decriminalizing drugs must be part of criminal justice reform, otherwise it can't be really meaningful.	The war on drugs is one of the root causes of criminal injustice.	Jeff Sessions reinvigorated this war that predominantly targets poor people and people of color.
The alternative vote method here works as follows:	Count first choices, if no option gets a majority, then drop the least popular option. Then recount except the second choice is used for those who voted for the least popular option. For the others the first choice is counted.
The best way forward on Brexit negations in my opinion is:	Hold a new referendum. And give three options:	- Remain 	- May's deal	- Hard Brexit	Then give people a first choice and a second choice (alternative vote method). &gt;

@libertythePD @ArchDornanMKVII @BrowningMachine @jacobsoboroff It's unbelievable. The worst case scenario for them is that the court reverses their voter suppression measure.	And even then it succeeds partially, because people may not vote, because they heard they couldn't.
@ArchDornanMKVII @BrowningMachine @jacobsoboroff @libertythePD Voters already do that.	If even Republicans try to make that as difficult as possible, by not allowing all sorts of ID cards.	But you agree with me, that there should be a criminal punishment for lawmakers who abuse their power to suppress votes?
@ArchDornanMKVII @BrowningMachine @jacobsoboroff @libertythePD They are.	The same should apply to lawmakers who abuse their power to suppress the vote of their opponents.	People like Kemp belong in jail, too.
@JoscoJVTeam @jacobsoboroff @libertythePD The National Review is usually full of it.	It's obvious she was not encouraging undocumented people to vote. 	This is no evidence for actual voter fraud. 	On the contrary the evidence for Republican foul play is overwhelming.

@JayCaruso @SRuhle @PeterAlexander @evansiegfried The penalty operates like an insurance. It provides incentive to have insurance. And otherwise people have paid anyway.	However a big mistake made with the ACA rollout was that the penalties were too low in the beginning, IMO. It should have been as high as insurance itself.
@JayCaruso @SRuhle @PeterAlexander @evansiegfried It's not possible to support protection of pre-existing conditions and be against the individual mandate.	Otherwise someone can choose not be insured and wait until they get sick and then get an insurance.

@CincinnatusPax @AiderNr @KurtSchlichter He doesn't have to be lynched. He just cannot become one of the most powerful people in the world. At least he shouldn't.
@CincinnatusPax @AiderNr @KurtSchlichter He wants to be a Supreme Court justice.	He should have impeccable morals. The lies and half truths under oath are unacceptable for anyone, let alone a Supreme Court justice.
@AiderNr @KurtSchlichter But if you were asked a question about it under oath. You would try to explain.
@AiderNr @CincinnatusPax @KurtSchlichter From this source: https://t.co/i52SeAZE6A
@AiderNr @CincinnatusPax @KurtSchlichter And this: "I was focused on trying to be number one in my class and being captain of the varsity basketball team and doing my service projects, going to church."
@AiderNr @CincinnatusPax @KurtSchlichter No, I didn't.	But this is from the transcript: "The vast majority of the time I spent in high school was studying or focused on sports and being a good friend to the boys and the girls that I was friends with."
@CincinnatusPax @AiderNr @KurtSchlichter I am just one person. Don't blame my fellow country people for my actions. üòú
@AiderNr @KurtSchlichter He said he never went to a garthering like that.	Meaning to a gathering where there were around 6 people in a house, where alcohol was drunk.	It is obvious that he did attend gatherings like that.
@CincinnatusPax @AiderNr @KurtSchlichter His credibility matters, because he is being accused. So when he lies about his teenage years and about his drinking then, it poses a question, did he lie about never assaulting anyone and never blacking out too?	Just the lies under oath should be disqualifying, by the way.
@CincinnatusPax @AiderNr @KurtSchlichter His yearbook itself is not the problem. It's the fact he is being accused of sexual assault. And his first defense was that he was this good kid, that did do almost nothing but study and play sports. His yearbook and calendar suggest that was a lie. &gt;
@AgentCoopr702 @SDESJ4 @KurtSchlichter He should have. I don't know why he didn't. Maybe he was embarrassed or he didn't realize it at that moment. Senators are politicians. They're good in talking, not so much in questioning. The GOP prosecutor actually did it better at times. That's why they stopped giving her time.
@AiderNr @KurtSchlichter This is a good article:	https://t.co/4XFytt22u2
@AiderNr @KurtSchlichter Have you farted yet?	Just seems off for an 18 year old.	That alone wouldn't have an issue, but the other times he didn't tell the truth or the whole truth combined make it an issue. Like when he said he never attended a gathering like the one described by Miss Ford.
@AgentCoopr702 @SDESJ4 @KurtSchlichter Because it would explain why they made the jokes. And it would give him the opportunity to stall, which he did on all other questions. But on this one he would have had a good reason.
@AiderNr @KurtSchlichter Stupid jokes about sex, yes.	Stupid jokes about farting, not so much.
@SDESJ4 @KurtSchlichter It's not the kind of joke an 18 year old would make in a yearbook.	Unless there is a story, or a running gag, but then he should have said so at the hearing.
@KurtSchlichter Do you really believe, to boof means to fart?	That would mean Mark and Brett wrote 'Have you farted yet?' on their yearbook pages. They were 18 at the time, not 8.

@KChick1968 @studentsabrina If I read the Wikipedia, I personally would agree with Gamble. It's not fair to be punished twice for the same crime. It's different however if someone is pardoned for a crime or a sentence is commuted.
@KChick1968 @studentsabrina So if someone is prosecuted federally then pardoned, then it could be considered double jeopardy if that person is prosecuted for the same crime by a state. That is if Gamble wins his case and then even a judge could consider the situation totally different if a pardon is given.
@KChick1968 @studentsabrina I am not a lawyer. But I think Gamble vs US is about this: "Terance Martez Gamble was prosecuted under both state and then federal laws for possessing a gun while being a felon".	From: https://t.co/rSocbn1E0C		&gt;

And reporters should stop calling it 'tax cuts'. It's a deficit-financed tax bill with some temporary tax cuts. It shifts the tax burden from the rich to the poor. Almost everybody making less  than 75K, will eventually pay more.	'Middle class tax increase bill' is more accurate.
They probably hope they can then either blame Dems for the tax increase, resulting from their own law. Or they can force Dems to make the tax bill permanent, like they did with the Bush 43 tax bill. 	&gt;
This is  more than 5% decline in purchasing power, which is a lot.	This shows two things: Apparently Republicans don't care about the poor (no news).	But also, they think Democrats will take over government in the next couple of years. &gt;
This chart also shows how these tax cuts were designed to have shortterm political gain. The tax cuts are the largest in the first couple of years.

@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump They are not senior officials working at the White House.	It's probably Kelly, Sanders, Bolton, Pence, Ivanka Trump, Kushner. People hired by Trump think he is a dangerous to the country. Open your eyes.
@DavidCornDC Wouldn't Nick Ayers or another speech writer be too low in the food chain for the NY Times to publish an anonymous op-ed? If it's Pence speech writer, Pence must have told NY Times he supports the article.	Otherwise it would be journalistic malpractice in my view.

@BretBaier @SenateMajLdr @SpecialReport Will you ask him about the NY Times anonymous op-ed?	Will you ask him about the President's tweet attacking Jeff Sessions for not letting two Republican Congresspeople get away with a crime for political purposes?
The author should blame the people who enabled him. Read the Republican party. And the people who enabled the enablers: The people who voted for a Republican.
And the tone, which feels like dissing the resistance and blaming the American people. Like if the people who chose to work for this wannabe dictator are true patriots. And the people who warned Trump is in every unfit to be President for years are somehow part of the problem. &gt;
The deregulation is just slashing of existing regulation that exists for a reason, not having smart new ones. Very bad environmental things will happen.		&gt;
Talking about "tax reform" , it's not. It has very little reform, it is a deficit ballooning tax cut. The implementation will turn out to be a disaster when people are filing their 2018 taxes next year. 		&gt;
"that there are adults in the room"	The adults in the WH are all traitors, except Secretary Mattis (he can delay a nuclear strike).		&gt;
Bonkers indeed.	In my view:	The author is almost as out of touch with reality as his/her boss.	"unsung heroes in and around the White House" WTF?! Unsung heroes?! What an arrogance, calling yourself that. 	&gt; https://t.co/wMsQ2NrnfY
It's called the 25th amendment or impeachment. But the @GOP is complicit. @SpeakerRyan, @SenateMajLdr and company are traitors.	The two party electoral system has no answer for when the party in power is totally corrupted. https://t.co/x0Wr9AByn5

@LauritzVonG @ArchDornanMkVI @achldhrt Humans work for media companies.	Humans benefit from a good and critical press.
@vonclausewitz69 @LauritzVonG You set dangerous precedent if you do that. And with this President, it means MSNBC, CNN, Washington Post etc. are all banned if he gets his way.
@ArchDornanMkVI @achldhrt @LauritzVonG Unless the consequences are based on what the government likes or does not like about the substance of the reporting. If freedoms are suppressed based on that, then it is an attack on freedom of the press.
@achldhrt @LauritzVonG When a reporter is hampered to do their job, because of what they report. Then that is an attack on freedom of the press. And is therefor a violation of the first amendment.
@LauritzVonG But then they wouldn't have the same platform or pay.	The fact this looms over their heads makes their reporting for that company less free.
