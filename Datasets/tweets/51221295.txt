Perhaps. Was never saying double reference can’t overcome - anything is possible. https://t.co/NSSXzyPX2F
The trooper pay-only bill sb544 (I was referring to previously) is on 3rd Senate reading on Mon.  A double-reference made on Day 46 isn’t ideal when factoring effort to pass budget bill without session extension. Can’t recall many triples in 15 years of reporting on legislature. https://t.co/TjzKgQJ2h1
Double-reference could also amount to slow death for the ‘clean’ teacher salary bill as pressure builds to pass a budget bill with every passing day of the waning session.(Note: pay raise bill only for troopers is advancing.) So many scenarios, so little time @HeraldMailNews https://t.co/WAhSGEUhSM

@BB_Halce @porterthereport Again, yet another opinion, and you certainly are entitled to it. Just know my statements/feedback regarding publishing standards - from one journalist to another - certainly wasn’t an invite for your sideline observations. But I’ve enjoyed them nonetheless.
@BB_Halce @porterthereport If you, the intervening bystander, must engage in such a personal manner, then so be it. I regret bringing out the apparent negativity in your heart. That was certainly not my intention. I apologize.
@BB_Halce @porterthereport And you are certainly entitled to an opinion, but that wasn’t the journalistic point I was conveying earlier. I also have opinions, but as a journalist, my job is to fully report news/observations and resist publishing personal reactions to a snippet of, if not the whole, story.
@BB_Halce @porterthereport And you know this because you’ve spoken with the chancellor? Again, reaching for a conclusion that you likely have no way of knowing is accurate. Assumptions based on circumstantial evidence can lead one to infer privately, but isn’t a standard upon which to publish, aka tweet.
@porterthereport Just maybe do a little more homework before rushing (tweeting) to essentially make an opinionated admission that only reveals you or others have failed to obtain an explanation for the statement. Perhaps #POTUS simply has great personal relationships with these G-7 leaders?

@RyanEQuinn As a fellow 1st amend defender, a story about free/legal, albeit offensive speech obviously got my attention. Enjoyed the discussion!
@RyanEQuinn Again, everyone has their own style/standard for attribution, sources of allegations, etc, we simply use allege/allegedly for crime.
@RyanEQuinn Who actually tweeted the words? Was there a confession?
@RyanEQuinn And the ap style says 'avoid any suggestion that the writer is making an allegation' and to specify the source of it
@RyanEQuinn Is the reporter alleging?
@RyanEQuinn Who is alleging?
@RyanEQuinn Everyone has their own style rules, but we tend to follow AP style for use of the word allege/allegedly - https://t.co/HECQ8Vw74A
@RyanEQuinn Use of 'allegedly' lumps this teacher's offensive tweets in with murder and every other crime and it clearly is not a crime.
@RyanEQuinn Reason given for reserving 'allegedly' only for crimes is to clearly define for readers, crime v. non-crime, leaving no blur between them
@RyanEQuinn Here, we are strongly advised by editors to reserve 'allegedly' for crimes and 'claims', 'supposedly' 'apparently' for civil offenses
@RyanEQuinn Agreed. I'm assuming we know that no one else had access to these social media accounts? Obviously, highly unlikely, but I can't assume
@RyanEQuinn Guilty of tweeting offensive material? Again, not a crime. Implying offensive free speech is a crime is misinforming
@RyanEQuinn Use of the word 'allegedly' strongly implies criminal activity, no? Supposedly tweeting offensive material isn't a crime.
