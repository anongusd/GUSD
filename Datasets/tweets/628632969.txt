@SapphireVC Thank you as well! Great insights for both founders and investors as they embark and continue down their respective roads.
Lastly, as asked during Q&amp;A, what is the single most important thing that makes a PE invest well in a co.? Objectively evaluating &amp; truly understanding what they are buying since, “sometimes, great assets are tucked away in bad situations.” 🔍
We’ve all likely heard about the “grow at all costs” phenomenon &amp; it’s one that has negatively affected some co.’s. In regard to this, keep in mind that sometimes letting your competitors take some territory while you sit back, is strategic (think primary and secondary markets). https://t.co/cOMywmU8LK
Alan’s advice to startup founders and execs who may receive offers from a PE? 1. Meet firms that are relevant in your industry 2. Ask about their investment strategies 3. Get intros to peers that went through this journey with that particular PE https://t.co/eQYcJr6cSb
In discussing the rising trends of VC exits to Private Equity, what makes PE appealing? A couple of things: the availability of the debt market, cap table clean-up, and the capital efficiency of today. https://t.co/M1dFhk6YDY
