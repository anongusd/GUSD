The Durbin DTC amendment must be removed from the minibus immediately due to its violation of the First Amendment. #OpposeDTC #Direct-to-confusion #FirstAmendmentRights
CIFE opposes the Durbin #DTC amendment because it violates the First Amendment and encroaches on our constitutional rights. We strongly encourage @USRepRodney @RepKayGranger @TomColeOK04 @KenCalvert @rep_stevewomack @Robert_Aderholt @RepHalRogers @RepMarthaRoby to do the same.
We encourage @ChuckGrassley to oppose the Durbin #DTC Amendment, a proposal that would inflict more harm than benefit for patients, and could have unintended consequences of deterring patients from seeking care. #OpposeDTC
CIFE along with a coalition of free market and conservative organizations oppose the Durbin #DTC Amendment. This Amendment not only violates the First Amendment, but would confuse patients and misdirect federal public health resources. #OpposeDTC @ChuckGrassley
CIFE Fact of the Week #9! The STRONGER Patents Act confirms that patents are property rights and deserve the same rights as other kinds of property!
Through the STRONGER Patents Act, the patent owners will be able to make investments with reasonable security in the validity of the patent while limiting abusive and repetitive challenges to their patent!
Thank you @RepThomasMassie for speaking with @replouiegohmert about the erosion of patent rights and how Congress can help restore America’s gold standard patent system! #PatentsMatter https://t.co/watjWdl7pY
FOW: As stated by Lonnie Johnson, Inventor of the Super Soaker: “The strong patent system that helped me succeed in the 80s and 90s is now weaker due to court decisions and other changes in the law."
Fact of the Week: Of patents reaching a final written decision, 85% resulted in one or more claims being held invalid. An additional 3,055 patents have been subject to PTAB petitions but haven't received a final written decision. These patents are in limbo
If the patent owner lacks deep pockets or good lawyers, his patent will not survive. If he does have access to infinite funds, he only has about a 5% chance of survival thanks to the America Invents Act and the USPTO’s implementation of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board
Once the globe's gold standard for patent protection, the U.S. patent system fell out of the top ten, tumbling to a tie for 12th with Italy, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s annual Global IP Index.
"I do believe that the changes we are considering right now will make a significant difference and help us rise back in the ranks and once again lead the world," USPTO Director Andrei Iancu said about his proposed changes to the PTAB
America’s patent system has contributed over $800 billion to the economy. However, in recent years, the patent system has faced significant challenges leading to a hostile environment for American inventors causing a brain drain of America’s innovation economy #strongerpatents

@USPTO Iancu "For the IP system to operate as intended, rights owners must perceive patents as reliable, predictable, and high quality." We need stronger patents now! #PatentsMatter
