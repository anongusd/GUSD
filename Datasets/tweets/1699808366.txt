@kkondik Though so, and again realize 2018 is not the year for it
@kkondik Realize this is not the year for it (probably) but would a candidate like Tom Kean have a good chance of beating an embattled Menendez ?
@kkondik I'm seeing biggest losses in California with Issa, Rochrabacher, Knight and Denham all losing as of now
@kkondik Certainly may change in the future. To your point made earlier that voter intentions change slowly, it seems to be moving towards R's 2/3
@kkondik Retirements are key to any Democratic takeover bid. My current prediction (using Crystal Ball as a baseline) is 231-204 for Republicans.
