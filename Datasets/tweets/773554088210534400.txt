@EWErickson @resurgent wouldn't the contract just go to a different group that doesn't discriminate, but still helps the poor...?
@EWErickson @resurgent why didn't you cite a single, actual example of the christian charities losing a government contract...
@EWErickson do you honestly feel that your values are threatened because a handful of transgender children want to learn to be a scout?
@realDonaldTrump Well said
@realDonaldTrump Obama's AG Eric Holder wasn't confirmed until February 2nd, so I'm not sure if this qualifies as a grand injustice...

@realtrumptweet at least in the last 3 decades, the media age, the extended campaign cycle where the candidate is in the household every day
@realtrumptweet the electorate has always repudiated the establishment, qualified candidate - hw, dole, gore, kerry, mccain, romney, clinton
everyone seems to be missing a simple takeaway: the electorate always elects the most "real" candidate - clinton, bush, obama, trump
6) Each individual that joins that march, they make their mark on history. The good fight has always been there, and always will be.
5) Despair serves no purpose, but a righteous sense of injustice and the willingness to fight for the world as it should be, that matters.
4) We all push forward and move our collective human consciousness toward a more just plane.
3) There are always aberrations in our progress, at times horrific, and at times only apparently horrific.
2) The history of humanity is a painstakingly gradual increase in empathy, cooperation, and general betterment of all.
1) It is a long, slow march out of darkness and barbarism.
