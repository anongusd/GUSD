All I know is that I am trying to survive from now to 2 seconds from now
I see people planning, working, doing and I just don't understand how it happens. I can't even think that I have a future
I struggle so much with the idea that I could actually do something with my life. I don't know how to make it happen. Every time I try to do something towards my future, my brain goes crazy and just shuts down. I just don't have the ability to do anything
I am at a crossroads, on the cusp of life. I'm struggling to find motivation to figure out how I want my life to turn out.

We have the vision America, now we need the action!
A truly brave America means each citizen is willing to admit to themselves the Injustices we see and commit and to then rectify them with love. Improvement and change takes time and effort and can be hurtful.
A truly free America means that opportunities are provided to ALL people within our country equally, without senseless discrimination
I don't put my hand over my heart for the anthem or say the pledge until I truly believe it is the land of the free and the home of the brave. However, I stand out of respect for our country and the sacrifices made by ALL heroes for a better life.
