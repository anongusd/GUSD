I was incarcerated with Reality Winner recently and have a lot to say Please listen! https://t.co/FwpAtMFtkL
My point being if they are going to incarcerate one person who was trying to help our citizens then why weren't these other govt. Officials treated the same, why isn't our president being investigated!?? I'm young but I don't want to live in a country ran by a scam artist !!!!!
https://t.co/JU97twjelN
@bjwinnerdavis RealityWinner tried to help the citizens by letting them know whats going on and Donald Stump has punished her concerning things said about the Russians, yet Putin and him where bffs if you would before the election. Is he being investigated?#Sad #Justice4Reality
As it says here in this article,People who don't have power in the gov Gov. Officials are not tried and prosecuted the same as those who have lesser power where is the justice if #RealityWinner was and still is incarcerated for trying to help why weren't they!!!!! @bjwinnerdavis https://t.co/MxVl6T03n2

@bjwinnerdavis
Idc what anyone has to say regarding Reality if it's not positive, and if you can sit there and bash her name for being a patriot n bein concerned for "We The People" which she was dedicating her life to serve, then you are irrelevant to me and ignorant and purely full of shit ! https://t.co/twbhQZwKe5

How is she suppose to wear pants when they are being washed and oh by the way in the rule book it says in Section 5.6.1 "inmates are to wear shirts and pants unless waiting for laundry" how does that constitute not giving her the medication she is suppose to take #ImPissedAgain
It's sad that I'm on the phone with Reality and she's telling me that the guards refused to give her, her medication because she had on shorts .. because her pants where in the motherfucking laundry smfh  #ImPissed #TheGuardsAreOuttaPocket
I Support Reality And have a lot to say! #FreeRe @Rosie forget what others have to say your amazing https://t.co/JIcpFxw8Tt
@bjwinnerdavis
Also they denied us our outside time simply because they didn't want to take us or because they got mad an an inmate and had attitude. We are humans not caged animals and Running is Reality's favorite thing to do to pass time .. #Justice4Reality
@Lizseeds0311 I Told Reality when I was in there with her that as long as I'm Here she has a voice from inside the Jail. How they treat her is wrong and there is no way I will sit silent while she suffers and IK first hand what she's going through #Justice4Reality

@WendyMeer11 Thank You! I Will, My goal right now is to let the people know what Reality is going through in the jail down here. They abuse their authority and deny medicalattention or postpone it until they feel ready to deal with anyone, deny books n documents just because they can #Pitiful

I don't know Reality from a can of paint, but She is a Smart, Brave, Caring, Patriot that has been falsely labeled as this "threat" to our Country. She loves her family OUR COUNTRY and of course her cat. I can't sit and be silent when she doesn't deserve how she is being treated.
Not one time did she say anything out the way to anybody, not one time did she seem like a threat to anyone. She was constantly talking about how she wants to help people, how she wants to decrease the amount of pollution that's produced every year.
When I went to the back to the dorm Reality came to me and asked if I needed anything and talked to me and calmed me down. If she is this big "Criminal" and Such a "threat" to our country, then how come all she does is help people and Served our Country to help fellow citizens..
@bjwinnerdavis I Was recently in the jail Reality is currently serving time at. I did not know anything about her, but I will say she is an amazing, kind, caring person who would never harm anyone or start problems. I have a lot to say.. #FreeRealityWinner https://t.co/eXOcOOXGGW
