@RainaNightinga1 @DarylLicTecOAA Romans 10:14-18.
@RainaNightinga1 @DarylLicTecOAA I believe the bible is true. Even with all the translations of the bible in this world, the message of salvation has not changed. The Lord commanded that the glorious gospel be preached throughout the world. We are also commanded to "Study to show ourselves approved unto God."
@RainaNightinga1 @CoorayAnthony Also, a lot of people, even Christians, struggle to comprehend the Trinity, and no man has ever been able to explain it perfectly. The mystery of the Godhead was revealed to us by God. Amen!
@RainaNightinga1 @CoorayAnthony Hi Raina. The mystery of the Godhead or Trinity (Acts 17:29, Romans 1:20 &amp; Colossians 2:9) was not fully revealed until Jesus came here on earth.

@SolaScriptura99 @PTerrone1986 @lyfetreker Thank you, and you have a good night too!
@PTerrone1986 @SolaScriptura99 @lyfetreker Repentance also has to do with the heart, according to scripture. Matthew Henry's commentary explains Mark 1:15 quite well. And according to Romans 2:5, it's not good to have a "hard and unrepentant heart." It is God who gives these gifts of "repentance unto life" and faith to us
@SolaScriptura99 @PTerrone1986 @lyfetreker And time and time again, God called them to repentance. "Self-complacency is the death of repentance." Charles Spurgeon
@PTerrone1986 @SolaScriptura99 @lyfetreker The biblical or theological meaning of repent is to grieve, lament or groan. In other words, it has more to do with the heart than the mind (Also see Romans 2:4,5 "impenitent heart"). Overcoming our sin or to "mortify the deeds of the body" is done by the Spirit (Romans 8:13).
@PTerrone1986 @lyfetreker @SolaScriptura99 Yes, we are all unrighteous and "choose to sin", but we have a free will to turn to God for forgiveness. As SolaScriptura99 pointed out, too, we need to "repent" as God has commanded.  David, Daniel and even saintly Job repented in dust and ashes (Job 42:5,6).

@GOPoversight @TGowdySC That's right.

@ThomasWictor The U.S. has certainly trained the Iraqis well, but don't know if their new leader or even the Iraqi people would want to get into another war to take down the mullahs in Iran. I don't the Pres. Trump would want to get into that war.
@ThomasWictor Also, you said in (25) Saddam Hussein confronted the mullahs (Iran), but Reagan did help Saddam because Iran started winning the war. Reagan feared if Iran won, they would go into Saudi Arabia, and is why he helped Saddam. It's why Reagan sent Donald Rumsfield to Iraq.
@ThomasWictor I have a question though. You said in (9) and (19) that Qassam Soleimani is dead? Did you mean physically dead or spiritually? SoS Pompeo just spoke about Someimani 4 days ago, and said he is causing a lot of problems in Iraq and Syria. https://t.co/egHgx1I5J9

While former President Obama also urged our NATO allies to share the defense burden, President Trump is the one getting results. Since President Trump took office, each member state has increased its defense spending:
‚ÄúWe will continue to focus on defense spending, as President [Trump] just said, NATO Allies have to invest more in defense, and that‚Äôs not exactly what they‚Äôre doing,‚Äù President Trump thanked the Sec.

@dailystrategies @DHSBlueCampaign @ICEgov I saw a video from 2014 where an illegal mother had to leave her children here and be deported 15 minutes away into Tijuana, and that was under Obama. Many families and asylum seekers were deported. It is a sad situation, but people have to obey and respect other countries laws.
@dailystrategies @DHSBlueCampaign @ICEgov Their crime started when they came here illegally. There are many U.S. consulates and embassies in their countries for them to apply for citizenship, but those who choose to come unlawfully will suffer the consequences. Trump has tried to pass new immigration laws 4 or 5 times.
@dailystrategies @DHSBlueCampaign @ICEgov Trump has tweeted they are only going after the worse offenders, like MS-13 gang, not green card holders (unless for violent crimes). I do want to say, on behalf of Marilyn Pharis, that Trump spoke often of her at his rallies, and many others who were murdered by illegal aliens.
@dailystrategies @DHSBlueCampaign @ICEgov Records show who are the criminals (we don't decide), and have been deported for decades under the past Presidents, not just Trump. Immigrants who break our laws feel entitled, and that's wrong. They need to be deported. That's the law and will always be the law.
@dailystrategies @DHSBlueCampaign @ICEgov We have Proposition 47 and sanctuary cities that are getting Americans murdered, and the illegal drug/human traffickers will keep sending children, adults and drugs across the border until we build a wall and change our immigration laws. Until then, U.S. citizens are the victims.
@dailystrategies @DHSBlueCampaign @ICEgov Marilyn would be alive today if the court didn't lesson Martinez's charges, and the court would have contacted ICE to deport him. That's why we need ICE.
@dailystrategies @DHSBlueCampaign @ICEgov 4) However, immigration officials were not notified  because Martinez‚Äôs charges were reduced to a misdemeanor, which meant he didn‚Äôt meet the threshold  for deportation.
@dailystrategies @DHSBlueCampaign @ICEgov 3) Martinez, from Mexico, has prior assault and drug convictions and was flagged by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to be deported before the attack.

@dailystrategies @DHSBlueCampaign @ICEgov 1)  This is what happened in CA: Marilyn Pharis, a Veteran, was murdered in 2015 by an undocumented immigrant from Mexico. A week before he brutally murdered her, he had charges against him that were reduced to a misdemeanor, because of idiot voters who voted for Prop 47.
@andrewsheeler @DHSBlueCampaign @ICEgov Why didn't Obama and Jeh Johnson get that fixed?

@jrandazzel @sweetshellyd @DHSBlueCampaign @ICEgov Obama, Bush and Clinton had their chance.

@realDonaldTrump You have every right to be angry, Mr. President. Many bad actors have and are guilty of not upholding the Constitution, and are more worried about the "institutions" they have corrupted. God is with you, Mr. President.
@realDonaldTrump On Thursday, Mr. Obama directed tough comments to Central American parents  in an interview on ABC News. ‚ÄúDo not send your children to the  borders,‚Äù the president said. ‚ÄúIf they do make it, they‚Äôll get sent  back. More importantly, they may not make it.‚Äù https://t.co/PjzdbROxxd
@realDonaldTrump Obama's ATEP program and AG Sessions zero tolerance policy still doesn't address the seriousness of children being separated. I hope you, Mr. President, and congress can fix this a.s.a.p.
@cristal_deaton The Obama program resulted in many families being split up, as reports revealed, but the program wasn't meant to separate families. The ATEP and AG Sessions zero tolerance policy still doesn't address the seriousness of children being separated. Trump &amp; congress need to fix this.

@cristal_deaton I'm not rewriting history. It appears the AG is using Obama's "Alien Transfer Exit Program (ATEP)" which was implemented in 2008 under Obama. It really needs to stop, meaning the children need to be protected. Former Gov. Rick Perry did not like the program.
@cristal_deaton Under the Obama administration, the separation and/or deportations were used to deter immigrants from coming in. A judge did try to stop the separations, but it didn't stop Obama from deporting more illegal aliens than any other President.
If you read the CBP report, all this information between 2009 and 2014 is in the fifth paragraph.
