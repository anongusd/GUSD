Counter to today’s cynicism? Watch a girls HS basketball game. The effort, focus, dedication—all inspiring.

@SopanDeb More disturbingly, the “it thing that I have really wanted” shows you’re going into an interview looking only for a quote to reinforce your preconceived notion of the story. You’re not listening. By definition, that’s not an interview or, frankly, journalism. That’s a trap.

@LBoogie213 That sure was the message sitting for a solid HOUR in total gridlock trying to get into Eagle Arena.  Non existent traffic control. Would love to know how many fans missed tip-off or most of the first half. The players deserved better.
@Coach_Campbell @tracytran @dcsportsbog Ok capacity would make sense. Now let’s fill it up! Was infuriating to see vast swaths of empty seats in the lower deck and floor for games at GW.

Sources say the more recently confirmed federal appeals court Judge Amy Coney Barrett is also under consideration to be among the 3-5 the President will interview for #scotus.
Sources confirm three primary front runners for #scotus, all federal appeals court judges with sterling academic qualifications: Brett Kavanaugh, Raymond Kethledge, Amul Thapar. Here’s our @CBSNews piece tonight: https://t.co/hDQpxs3Pil
Very little Democrats can do, after making one of the biggest political blunders in modern history—squandering the filibuster on the SCALIA’s replacement. Moderate Rs were less likely to support nuclear option w/ AMK successor. #scotus
A conservative with a libertarian streak, Kennedy sometimes sided with liberals on social issues, from abortion to gay rights. Conservatives now have a real shot at turning #scotus to the Right.
JUSTICE KENNEDY IS RETIRING—giving Trump a chance to move #scotus solidly to the Right for a generation.

@maggieNYT @HickmanPolls And whether Trump will actually make a big leap (for the first time) into the general election campaign
@maggieNYT @HickmanPolls Will be interesting to see how the Democratic nominee tries to cobble together enough support to beat a Trump-like opponent
@maggieNYT @HickmanPolls I think the broader question is where do the Strange voters, who (unlike the Moore voters) didn't back Trump in the R primary, go now.
@maggieNYT @HickmanPolls Agree, but don't forget the "yeah but  that's Alabama" response. Another reason it's hard to extrapolate any broader message from this race
@maggieNYT @HickmanPolls It's hard to see how a speech "for Strange" (wink wink) did anything more sweeping than galvanize anti-NFL fury beyond a state w no NFL team
@maggieNYT @HickmanPolls Maybe I misunderstood your original tweet. But no Alabama voter thought Trump made a full leap for Strange, no matter who they supported.
@maggieNYT That's a fair point and you get Trump world for sure. My point is Alabama voters--Moore voters were and are Trump's most die-hard supporters
@maggieNYT True. Have not checked the analytics--relying on tough conversations w friends, family and people in the state I grew up in and love
@maggieNYT @Bencjacobs Well he was the closest thing to Donald Trump in Alabama in this race so I'm now really sure what we're debating here. Who else is there?
@maggieNYT Got it. But that view, applied to this race, is wrong. Moore's win, if anything, shows Trump's appeal is stronger than ever in some states.
@Bencjacobs @maggieNYT Roy Moore is the Alabama version of Donald Trump. That's how voters saw him, and that's who they want in Washington.
@maggieNYT Moore supporters never thought Trump *really* meant vote for Strange. They were the majority of his rally in Huntsville!
@maggieNYT A full leap??? Hahahahaha. Not how Alabama voters who love Trump and came our for Moore saw it.
@jdawsey1 @charliespiering People saw a vote for Moore as a vote for Trump. Moore would not have won tonight if it weren't for Trump leading the way.
@jdawsey1 @charliespiering It's a referendum on Trump bc ppl EMBRACED his message and voted accordingly. No one thought Trump really meant vote for Strange (wink wink)

To everyone who said 2016 was the worst year ever, y'all can f--- off. And the dashes there are only bc Mama reads my tweets. #RollTide, Mom
@BarrettSallee @RealSkipBayless Watson met the top D in the nation. Buckled down and delivered. Wtf w these guys wanting a smile and dance?
I was about to throw something else, but then I saw this tweet. Oh how you wish you were in this elite group. Thanks, Auburn. You suck. #RTR https://t.co/Nz0OzMjkaF
Great game Clemson. And anyone who saw them play this yr wld have know Watson wasn't smiling early on bc he was FOCUSED to win the damn game
@ALawRadio We gotta get the offense going stat
All that whining in the booth about the hit on Williams -- it was a clean hit, exactly like that one delivered on Stewart by Clemson.
@pattonoswalt @jmntiger umm I think the point is adults don't HAVE to see anything. So lectures abt how stupid they are don't work, just FYI
@BruceRheins you know I never thought I'd miss Kiffin, and I still don't. But that would be nice to see, just one more time.
Anyone's game. This is a great Clemson team vs a great D. Who said Watson's bringing the energy level down?
@TonyFratto @KirkHerbstreit You beat them. But gave up 42 pts. This is not your defense. Watson isn't smiling? So what. Different game.
I'm sorry but wtf is @KirkHerbstreit talking about? Watson isn't smiling? His energy level? This ain't Pitt. This is not on Watson. Come on.
On tonight's @CBSEveningNews, @ScottPelley and I showing our true colors for tonight's game. #rolltide https://t.co/lqyvdzE9Wb
@espinsegall @JusticeWillett @AdamSFeldman @DavidLat good news/bad news. Your fears are unfounded, but your wish will go unfulfilled.
@DavidLat @AdamSFeldman I do. He has mentioned them from the beginning. But Gorsuch also up there.
@AdamSFeldman @DavidLat Gorsuch also made the cut. I'd put him ahead of Larsen for this seat.

"I'm very disappointed in our offense," said OSU Coach Urban Meyer, as if he had nothing to do w it. #asshole #familytime
@BruceRheins @victordlt maybe he will decide he needs to spend some time with his family #notafan
.@victordlt and also what impact that injury will have on the bowls. Will these guys even play-or just sit out like Fournette and McCaffrey?
.@victordlt oh man. Condolences. Tough game v FSU without Peppers -- and then to lose Butt. Gotta make u think what could have been
@victordlt sure looking that way right now unless Urban Meyer can light a fire in that locker room. They're totally outmatched.
Clemson, on the other hand, is playing like every down is the biggest they've ever played in their lives. Every down. Really impressive.
Someone needs to tell Ohio State they actually have to win this game before they get to play Alabama in Tampa. No focus at all.

@Yellow_Rose41 Yep. It was not a "slip." Just saying what I think and know. And thank YOU!

@madsenc @instapundit @Patterico @Jacobnbc My point was emphatically the opposite-- which is obvious if you care to read what I said.
@motionview @Patterico @SaraMurray Thanks--you just missed our previous tweets. Shortcomings of Twitter and 140-character snapshots!
@THE_DAILY_BLEAT @instapundit @Patterico My point is the opposite. It looks like  she did nothing more than express her political views.
@Patterico I see a woman being defiant and holding her ground in the face of angry crowd screaming and threatening to overwhelm her.
@Patterico Not the word I would have chosen, but I also was reading it in context w earlier tweets.
Looks like she was just showing off her Trump jersey before the assault @patterico--in response to protesters taunts https://t.co/2gcgJsBQW1
@Starkozy Wondering if we will have the kind of outrage you'd see if a woman were subjected to a similar group assault leaving an HRC rally.
@Patterico @seanmdav She may have been giving context. I read it as the woman was answering back to the protesters--they were already there.
This is incredibly disturbing. Imagine the reaction if she'd been leaving an HRC rally and assaulted like this.  https://t.co/tFuW6iA4xB

@IshYimini A heartbeat away. And with a 72-year-old presidential contender, something to take seriously.
@StevenJDuffield But Palin may have been perceived in 2008 as more malleable -- and perhaps that's the difference.
@StevenJDuffield If you're comparing the two, Trump is clearly more qualified than Palin. I don't see how you can seriously argue otherwise.
Because @BillKristol, I don't get how @SarahPalinUSA was qualified-- and @realDonaldTrump is not. Maybe you can let the American ppl know.
In fact, credit to McCain, @BillKristol and everyone else who told the American ppl Palin was qualified for the WH for the @realDonaldTrump.
Astonishing to see someone who spent years arguing Palin was qualified for the WH now saying Trump is not. You only have yourself to thank.

@NoahCRothman I think the more likely scenario is Justice Garland come December. But I cld see these confirmed -- many of them. Larsen, Eid.
@NoahCRothman Well, let's not single out @JusticeWillett! Look, Court is rarely/never an issue in elections. But w this election, who knows.
@NoahCRothman Perhaps. But hard to see a downside. You can't fault their qualifications--most of them are conservative legal rock stars.
@NoahCRothman With the future of the  Court in the balance for a generation, this also makes clear the stakes in this election.
@NoahCRothman Strikes me as a good idea. These are all highly credentialed/respected judges--may make Rs vowing to stay home rethink Trump.

Support for Garland: Conservative Miguel Estrada calls him "superbly qualified." Says "I look forward to his service on the Court." #scotus
@DavidLat Srinivasan also has kind of life experience the President said he considered an important quality in his nominee.
@DavidLat @HillaryClinton Srinivasan also brings unassailable qualifications; plus less risk HRC if elected would nominate someone else.
@marcambinder @SCOTUSnom @DavidLat The outside groups would be less than overjoyed.
@DavidLat Garland's the safest pick. Unassailable qualifications; age/temperament puts pressure on Rs. Argument is he's the best Rs cld get.

@Patterico Estrada refused to be considered for a recess appointment and for consideration for the Court. Process driving out the qualified.
@Patterico You think? Grassley holds the cards to some extent. And hey now are you, btw?
@mattizcoop in 2016, who is Homer Thornberry???!! No seriously. Who? I can't think of anyone. What say you?
@mattizcoop @jamesoliphant Not so sure about that. Maybe John Ashcroft would have a view. And not as if AG is a lifetime appointment.
@mattizcoop Agree. Here's  where the AMK analogy breaks down. Powell retired in June 87-- and an R president was replacing a Nixon nominee.
@jamesoliphant but does he go out of the box w that? Or save it in the back pocket--and first nominate someone who won't be confined?
@jamesoliphant Agree-tho she has told me in the past no interest in being on the Court. Assume she could be persuaded.
Or does he stick it straight to the Senate w a nominee like Sri Srinivasan or Merrick Garland? And what about Yale/UofC Sen. Amy Klobuchar?
Does Obama nominate a Trojan horse first---knowing he/she goes down--then a more palatable choice for the 14 Senate Rs he needs to confirm?
@jamesoliphant Yep-- and why it's impossible for either side to analogize past battles-- this is unlike anything we've seen before.
Justice Kennedy--the one Justice whose opinions drive conservatives nuts--now the poster boy for confirmation in an election year.
How's this for irony: WH to argue Senate Ds confirmation of AMK (Reagan's 3rd choice) in Jan '88 is precedent to confirm Scalia replacement.

@mbayer1248 @byjoelanderson And playing w a less than stellar QB and inexperienced WRs. And still the defenses are unable to shut him down.

So this whole 12th man thing? Wow. MUCH louder than the Patriots fans. About like standing next to a jet on takeoff. Or something like that.
Crucial drive by Seattle-- has to get offense going to take pressure off defense.
And that is why you never rule out Seattle. Great pass and catch. Throw the 1st quarter stats out the window!
Pats coverage in secondary is amazing. No one open for Wilson to throw to.

@tumbyMe She was wrong about that. But he didn't know the facts well enough to counter punch.
If there was a path for Romney in '12, his campaign didn't take it. The question now: Can he chart a different course? 2016 can't be a rerun
@DraperRobert Exactly. That's an easy question, which I asked because I was curious if he would respond in an unfiltered way to anything.
Oh I don't know, Romney said, when I asked once if the media was in the tank for Obama. He's got ppl who like him; I've got ppl who like me.
Sometimes I would deliberately toss Romney a softball, to gauge his convictions. "Is the media in the tank for Obama?" A nobrainer for an R.
That's the question. I don't know the answer. RT @mitchrc: .@jancbs So do you think he can change? Did he learn from it?
I cannot tell you how many times I interviewed Romney-- well over a dozen--when I walked away wondering what he really wanted to say.
At times, Romney seemed reluctant, almost paralyzed, to give anything but the "right answer." Whatever that might be.
Romney let his opponents define him. And with his passivity and awkward jokes, he did himself no favors in a hostile media climate.
I spent all of 2012 on the road covering Romney. Impression: Good man who could've been a good President. But a bad politician and campaign.

@KevinDBishop @DraperRobert But college. So penalty for the kid is "miss the remainder of the game and first half of team's next contest."
@DraperRobert Maybe I'm now in the wrong generation. Or season. Or sport. But if that's an ejection for targeting, this ain't football.
No dog in this fight, but having replayed 3 times--someone tell me how you eject a kid for targeting on that. Seriously what sport is this?

@jpodhoretz True for Ledbetter dissent also, which caught Alito completely by surprise. But rare for justices to express emotion like that.
@jpodhoretz I suspect his reaction signals broader frustration beyond Monday's cases. True for Breyer in '07-- a bad term for liberals.
@jpodhoretz The outrage is at his reaction. RBG has read aloud her dissents to his opinions before--notably Ledbetter in his first term.
@jpodhoretz He rolled his eyes at RGB dissent yest, causing predictable outrage (tho more blatant react by Breyer to Rbts/AMK in 07 did not)
That was true for Breyer in 07, when liberals lost on the big ones--school deseg and partial birth abortion. Very contentious/divisive term.
The interesting thing re Alito's reaction is if indicates a broader frustration w other rulings. Do conservatives lose on the big cases?

@susquinn Despite the TMZ report, we are skeptical over here she's REALLY named North. Has Kim contacted you re naming rights?
Rehnquist never minded if the big opinions all came in one day--and they often did! But Roberts has signaled the Court will spread them out.
The most contentious rulings always take the longest to decide--that's true every year. Question now is will they all come on the same day?
So we continue to wait--nothing big at SCT today. Expect decisions next week on affirmative action, same-sex marriage and voting rights.
RT @reynoldscat: Ted Olson heads into SCOTUS. Could today be day for same-sex marriage rulings? @JanCBS says probably not. http://t.co/WLKU…
@reynoldscat Hard to see same-sex marriage cases coming today if SCT decides constitutional merits. More likely if on procedural grounds.
@JoeBuckel1 Thanks--these decisions are so complex it always feels like a high-wire act to quickly interpret them. Looking forward to July!
@RichardEDerrJr @lmm527 @CBSThisMorning Indeed! They're fine-tuning/refining now--all separate opinions/dissents were due last week.

@ShannonBrinias @Little_Debs Hmmm...who is this @cbsjancrawford person? I must investigate w cbs asap--it's oddly close to MY own name.
Argument suggests Court will invalidate DOMA, but entirely possible a majority won't agree on legal rationale.
KAGAN, deeply skeptical, quotes '96 House report on DOMA, says it raises "red flag" Congress was "affected by "dislike, fear, animus."
SOTOMAYOR also asks about federalism: "What gives fed govt right to be concerned at all abt what definition of marriage is?"
Kennedy cares deeply about federalism issues (more than Robts). Tells atty defending DOMA marriage "always considered a state police power."
While Court indicates DOMA unconstitutional, justices suggest different rationales--equal protection (liberals) and federalism (Kennedy).
KENNEDY, the key swing vote, on federalism: "Question is whether the federal govt under our fed scheme has authority to regulate marriage?"
But issue of jurisdiction in DOMA -- and whether Court can decide case -- is a serious one. Several justices expressed reservations.
Today's arguments suggest federal Defense of Marriage Act in jeopardy. Five justices imply law is unconstitutional.
True, this. Much can happen btwn args &amp; opinion. MT @Robertwaldeck: Never known what majority thinks from oral args, even cases I've tried.
A punt on standing? Majority clearly not ready for broad ruling ok'ing sex marriage--but also seem dissatisfied w options for narrow one.
Justices on both sides also dubious of Obama Admin argument for a narrow ruling that states w civil unions can't ban same sex marriage.
KAGAN highly skeptical of Prop 8, asked atty defending it: What harm do you see happening--and when and how--to institution of marriage?
ALITO: asked about "need to be cautious" .."Same sex marriage is very new...newer than cell phones or the internet."
SOTOMAYOR: Why is taking the case now the answer? We let issues "perk." We let racial secregation perk 50 yrs.
JUSTICE KENNEDY: I just wonder if the case was properly granted.
The first questions--and about a quarter of the argument--focused on whether defenders of Prop 8 had proper legal standing.
In 80 minutes of arguments, justices on both sides seemed to be looking for a way to avoid deciding the merits of CA same-sex marriage case.
@jeravincer The Court says an expedited audio recording of the hour-long argument will be available by 1 pm today.
Huge crowds gathering early this chilly morning at the Supreme Court for today's arguments on same sex marriage. http://t.co/ON956TTxaK

@jamestaranto @ByronYork @mattklewis So what? That he/she initially saw nothing wrong in expressing those views is my point re newsrooms.
@jamestaranto @wapoombudsman @ByronYork @mattklewis My point is he/she is saying those things publicly as a reporter. Byline is irrelevant.
@jamestaranto @ByronYork @mattklewis He was emailing with a reader. I assumed he wasn't anonymous.

Very effective message from Romney on big banks. Goes against what many independents who see him as stereotype portrayed in ads wld expect.
The reason Romney is winning this debate is because you want to hear more of what he has to say and what he would do--and less from Obama.
Why did we have 23 GOP primary debates, and will just have three Presidential debates? That's just wrong, and tonight's debate shows why.
First 30 minutes are key for viewers' impressions, and Romney has broken through, though Obama is holding on.
Where has this Mitt Romney been? Focused and determined, taking on the President w specifics. This now feels like a race.

@markos That story is from April--our last poll.
On Obama's motivations for same-sex marriage: 70% of independents say it was for political reasons, not bc he thought it was right thing.
Most oppose same-sex marriage: In CBS/NYT poll, 51% think it should be illegal; 42% say legal.
Romney leads w independents in CBS/NYT poll, 43-36%  Obama has even bigger edge among moderates, 50-39%.
War on Women? Romney now edges Obama among women, 46-44%, in new CBS/NYT poll.
Romney takes 3-point lead over Obama in new CBS/NYT poll, 46 to 43%. A dead heat a month ago.
The government proposes an Aug. 1 trial date for KSM and four other suspects. Defense lawyers object and ask for more time.
Unlike 4 years ago, KSM, through his lawyer, says he will defer his plea--meaning lawyers now can argue over fairness of the procedures.
A US lawyer for one 9/11 suspect wore a black abaya &amp; hijab. Asked women military prosecutors, in uniform, to wear more "appropriate" dress.
During a break in today's hearing, KSM and the four 9/11 suspects, seated at different tables, talked back and forth, smiling and laughing,
In court today, no indication KSM or other 9/11 suspects will try to plead guilty, as they did 4 years ago, before charges were dismissed.
In his first hearing four years ago, KSM was in control in the countroom, w multiple outbursts. Today, he tried to control through silence.

But justices seem more skeptical of other parts of AZ law--those making it a crime to seek work or fail to register. Could strike down part.

Why the SCT will never release video & rarely audio: SG Verrilli did a fine job w a mountainous task. Excepts scapegoating him are wrong.
GINSBURG: People are getting cost-free health care. Only way to prevent that is say pay sooner not later.
GINSBURG: People who don't participate in this market are making it much more expensive for those who do.
GINSBURG: If govt makes us pay for social security we may not want, why can't it also make us pay for health insurance thru private market?
ALITO: The mandate is forcing people to provide a huge subsidy for insurance companies. Requires people to subsidize services used by others
Kagan offers most rousing defense of law in qs: "We're talking abt a matter of timing," say congress can require insurance when u need care.
Clear divisions bet liberals & conservatives in health care. Kagan, Soto, Breyer, Ginsburg defend. Robts, Scalia, Kennedy, Alito question.
ROBERTS: Once you make people buy insurance, "all bets are off," it'll be something else in next case? SCALIA: Everyone has to exercise.
KENNEDY: Health care law "changes the relationship between the individual and the government in a very fundamental way."
SCALIA: If government can do these things, what can it not do?
ROBERTS: Why can't the government make us also buy cell phones, since everyone could need emergency services someday?
KENNEDY: Can you "create" commerce in order to regulate it? Suggests govt has "heavy burden" in health care case.
SCALIA: Why are those problems the federal government can address? Clearly troubled by assertion of federal power.
In a two-hour session, Court majority appears skeptical of individual mandate. Troubled there would be no limits on Congressional power.

Exactly. RT @TPCarney: @ZekeJMiller He opposed a non-existent bill and it's not a matter of opinion that the question was "confusing"

Santorum can't stop himself from smiling at putting Romney on the spot re voting rts for felons. But then comes Perry w the save for Mitt.
Gingrich channels his inner 10-year-old in explaining why he went on the attack against Romney: He started it. #scdebate
A one-man wrecking ball? MT @SarahH_CBSNJ: Newt hitting Santorum...says he set all time PA recd for defeat & will have hard time winning.
Santorum is making that exact point. MT @jronc: 'Electability' was a big issue in '04 in Dem primary. Didn't work out so well for them.

@JRubinBlogger Voters need to know whether Santorum has heft to take on Obama and win. That's the bar for him. Perry couldn't cross it.

Unsure voters: reflecting this fluid race, 71% of voters in new CBS News national poll say they still could change their minds.
Santorum surging at Gingrich's expense. He nabs Gingrich voters and now leads among evangelicals and the very conservative.
VALUES: Santorum seen by voters as candidate who shares their values,  edging Romney 22% to 21. Gingrich 3rd w 14%
Electability: Romney far out front here. Gingrich down sharply, from 31% to 13, as voters doubt he can beat Obama. Santorum only w 8%
On the key measure of electability: 49% say Romney has  best chance to win, up from 37 pct in Dec.
Ron Paul in 4th place w support solid at 10% in new CBS News poll, unchanged from Dec poll.
Santorum Surge: In new CBS News poll, vaults into virtual tie for 2nd with Gingrich, who continues to plummet on key measures.
Romney out front in new CBS News poll w 19%. Gingrich (15%) loses ground to Santorum (14).

Finally getting a question, Perry goes 80 mph, veering from lane to lane: a 3rd party, an amendment banning gay marriage, war on religion.
News media bias! Now we're back on solid ground for Gingrich. And cue the applause. But wait. Didn't he tell us to read the NYT 30 mins ago?

For a viewers at home, Romney's incredulous exchange on right to contraception, (based on Santorum disagreement with Griswold) is spot on.
So far, this debate is like a playground brawl between Santorum, Newt, Perry and Paul. And Romney is the principal in charge.
Surprising that GOP attacks on Romney are from DNC playbook: Bain, corp work and how CEO experience doesn't mean real leadership. #nhdebate

Will Gingrich "strap on the hockey mask and pick up the chain saw?" My take on what to watch in tonight's debate: http://t.co/eHv4z85u
Romney's now serving spaghetti dinners. Tells @philiprucker he will be having some too. "I haven't eaten yet!"
When asked if candidates can get past the negative attacks, Romney says, "we'll put our bruised egos aside" and come together to beat Obama.
Voter says he's happy Romney didn't attack Gingrich in remarks. Asks if candidates can come together "to get Obama out of the White House."
And another issue for the general. RT @mviser: Woman asks Romney if he will give up some of his wealth so middle class can have tax cuts.
Romney continues to downplay Iowa, pokes fun at "huge landslide." Message: IA didn't embrace me. NH, you can be different, and I need you.
Romney foreshadows Solyndra as issue in the general, saying "Crony capitalism doesn't work here. I believe in the free enterprise system."
Teeing up an issue for the general election, Romney again hits Obama for "crony capitalism," specifically Solyndra.
Romney trying manage expectations and head off complacency: "We're in a real battle right now. Those polls--they can disappear overnight."

Romney stays above the fray and keeps focus on Obama, slamming his "failed presidency," and saying, to cheers, "it's his only term."

Mitt, confident: "I think for the long haul in IA, NH, SC, FL NV, I’ll be able to get the support I need to go on and get the nomination."
In my interview for @theearlyshow, Romney won't predict a win, but says "I think I’m going to get a good boost coming out of Iowa."
"Well, I’m happy Rick Santorum endorsed me in the last campaign," Romney says, adding "I wouldn’t be surprised to see him do very well."

Newt already has a gender gap with women, and his dismissiveness (bordering on belittling) toward an obviously prepared Bachmann won't help.

@johnsberman Well that makes more sense! I saw the transcript, which says "moderate."
Huh? Newt last night on Greta promised: "My campaign is going to be a moderate campaign, it is not going to be a Republican campaign."
Newt tonight on Greta: "I think in Republican circles being attacked by Nancy Pelosi is a badge of honor."
@fivethirtyeight But Romney can't control his Super PAC--which is likely to launch anti-Gingrich ads soon in Iowa.
@IanLazaran Fair point--but voters have forgotten about a lot of Gingrich's negatives. They're about to be reminded from Ron Paul & others.
@TruthOut4All Our poll is great for Paul. Shows he could be a huge factor in Iowa and leads in some categories.
@bdomenech It is AMAZING. The data in it is incredible--the scope of questions to assess vtr attitudes We can talk about it for days!

Good point. MT @IowaGOPer: I don't think Newt benefits from Cain's absence. People will now focus on Newt's record w Cain distraction gone.
Cain just told me he made the decision on his own before he got home. Couldn't put wife thru it anymore. Had "no regrets" in campaign.
Gloria Cain is smiling, hugging supporters. An elderly woman is crying, telling her she loves them, Gloria reached out and held her hands.
Gloria Cain told me "I'm fine--I'm good" and that part of her wanted Cain to stay in the race. "I went back and forth."
Gloria Cain just told me Cain made the decision before he got home--and she would have supported whatever he decided bc she believes him.
This sounds like a speech to relaunch a new career as talk show host.
"Proving that we could do this" was one of greatest accomplishments. Is Cain saying reaching "Final Four" enough?
"Come on Herman," whispers one woman--as is she can't bear to hear he's dropping out.
Cain and wife arrive smiling, waving, holding hands.
Am told by state GOP official the big covered backdrop behind the podium is a new Cain logo flown in last night--for "campaign relaunch."
Five different people coming out of meeting w Cain tell @bkappcbs and me he's in. But Cain didn't speak---just photos. So they don't know!

@bdomenech @jpodhoretz Romney has an average 18 pt lead in NH, according to RCP--and it would be higher but for one outlier poll.
@woodhouseb @HotlineJosh @jonmchenry You guys aren't giving @Bret_Baier or the reporters like @CarlCameronFox proper credit for their work.
@jpodhoretz It's not a bigger surge than Perry--tho Perry had time to self-destruct. Newt's baggage may not catch up w him before Iowa/SC/FL
@jpodhoretz I think that's right. But why? Because time is short, and they can't pursue the "let them destroy themselves" strategy?
@HotlineJosh @bdomenech Good point. But you'd think a man in the midst of his 2nd prez bid would have figured out the media intv by now.

There's something endearing about Bachmann raising her hand and politely asking Anderson to call on her.

Did Rick Perry really just call Herman Cain "brother" twice?

Perry looks furious at Romney for ignoring him, as he isn't even worth bothering with tonight, and instead asking Bachmann a softball.
RT @RealClearScott: Hint to candidates: If you ask the frontrunner your Q, it gives the frontrunner more time to look like the frontrunner.
@JohnJHarwood I don't think "impactful" was the word Perry was looking for, either.
Wait. Did Perry just say we don't need to be focusing on "this policy or that policy?" What, then?

Santorum is stealing Bachmann's thunder on immigration. Accuses Perry of being "soft" on illegal immigration.
Is this Rick Perry's "compassionate conservatism?" Says "you don't have a heart" if you don't agree w instate tuition for illegals.
Chris Wallace says most of the questions "by a wide margin" on immigration were for Perry.
Bachmann bashes tuition breaks for children of illegal immigrants, but doesn't bash Perry...yet.
An immigration question to Bachmann: Here's her chance to go after Perry.
After watching that "President Zero" ad from Perry this week, it never occurred to me he would be seem small tonight.
"You better find that Rick Perry and get him to stop saying that." Romney calls out Perry for backing off claims on Social Security.

An even better idea! RT @pbsgwen I'm with you, but maybe we can ban the practice of prebuttal as well as the word?

The Top 10 things we learned about Elena Kagan this week: http://tinyurl.com/3yysyoz
Here's my report for CBS Eve News 6/30/10 as Elena Kagan concludes 2nd day of questions. http://tinyurl.com/3ybg337
Leahy's final thought: No justice should substitute personal views. "SG Kagan, I believe you."	And the gavels the day's hearing over.
At the end of two long days of Qs, Kagan got this from Tom Coburn: "You light up a room. Congratulations on your nomination."
The laughs continue. Coburn: "I'm 12, 13 years older than you." Kagan: "Maybe not after this hearing."
We're hearing on Thursday the Kagan hearings will go to as late as 11pm, b/c Senate has to suspend hrgs when Sen. Byrd is lying in repose.
Sessions complains of "inaccurate spin" from the WH on Kagan's effort to limit military recruiting at Harvard. The temperature is rising!
Why is Al Franken on the Judiciary Committee?
This exchange w Kaufman also is flat. In fact, it's not just EK--the whole room is flat. Maybe because half the senators aren't here yet.
Strange exchange here w Klobochar (Yale, UofC Law). Kagan is not engaging at all--seems flat. She also dismissed a good Q on libel.
Committee calls tune, Kagan dances.  My CBS Evening News report on Day 2. http://tinyurl.com/2ub2ezv
Leahy ends the today's hearings. Kagan stands up with a big smile. She should be smiling. A good day for her, all in all.
Kagan, btw, called Bush nominee Miguel Estrada an "extraordinary human being" qualified to be on the appeals court AND the Supreme Court.
We're in a break now--hrgs will go til 8 or 9. But Kagan is holding her own, showing confidence, wit and charm to disarm some of the Rs.
Another funny moment of many. 	GRAHAM: Where were you on Christmas? Kagan: Senator, like all Jews I was probably at a Chinese restaurant.
Testy moment: Sessions clashes w Leahy over the chairman's repeated efforts to rebut the Rs whenever their time is up.
Kagan clearly studied Roberts hearings and is taking a page from his playbook. Talks about past cases being settled law (til they're not).
Kagan to Grassley on the Court's gun ruling: "I have absolutely no reason to think the Courts analysis was incorrect in any way."
Feingold: how can a NYkr like u understand small town folks? Kagan: "Try to learn from people other than yourself." That's NOT a DC concept.
Kagan on gun rights: "there will be some real work for the Court to do" in deciding what gun laws are acceptable after yesterday's ruling.
I'm anchoring a special Washington Unplugged on CBSNEWS.com during the lunch recess--will interview Sens. Cornyn, Klobochar and Brown.
Feinstein says she wants to have a "heart to heart" w Kagan. "Just you and me," Kagan quips. Leahy: Everyone in the room, don't listen!
Hatch is trying to preempt the Dems' argument on campaign finance--pressing Kagan on why the 1st Amendment doesn't protect unions and corps
