What was missing from POTUS #sotu was appreciation of the enormous contributions that immigrants make to our country. One of our greatest sources of strength as a nation is that the best, the brightest and hardest working people from all over the world desire to live in USA.
POTUS #sotu put forward a doable framework for resolving Dreamer issue. Will only happen with BIPARTISANSHIP &amp; COMPROMISE. Boiled down it‚Äôs Dreamers+ w/path to CITIZENSHIP, $25 billion or so for a wall/security &amp; move towards a more skill-based immigration system.

Completely support POTUS call to end defense sequester! Dangerous. #sotu
Immigration #sotu: Work w/R &amp; Ds: 1) path to citizenship for dreamer-eligible population; 2) full border security (wall on southern border/more agents, end catch &amp; release); 3) end visa lottery; &amp; move towards merit based system; 4) limit sponsorships to spouses/minors
