Waters calling out hedge fund housing investors as group driving up cost of housing, rent after the 2008 recession. 		"We need to develop more affordable housing," she says.
@DiegoZuluagaL @RepMaxineWaters She also discussed looking at fintechs, lending, and housing policy as ways to address underbanked communities and minority home ownership issues.
Waters &amp; @PatrickMcHenry reintroducing promoting promoting corporate standards for corporate insiders act. 		They're also planning bipartisan long-term flood insurance reauthorization, Ex-Im Bank and anti-terrorism bills, she says.
.@RepMaxineWaters taking lots of opportunities to call out Trump admin during today's policy speech. 		Hopes sanctions questions will be bipartisan, dings Treasury for lifting sanctions on Oleg Deripaska-linked businesses.

Hot take: affordable housing's going to be a big issue in 2020 elections
US facing housing affordability and homelessness crisis. Congress needs to provide surge of funding and resources, Waters said. Homelessness prevention bill coming.		Also: "comprehensive overhaul" of credit reporting.
"As fintech grows, there are opportunities for unmet needs to be addressed. We will be closely examining these issues in committee," @RepMaxineWaters says.

The goal is to drive more innovation into the financial services sector while balancing potential benefits and risks to consumer harms... 		Expect to see a lot of mixed reaction from consumer advocates, business groups and regulators in coming days... /7
The Bureau is also looking to use the policy as an opportunity for coordination and outreach with state- and other regulators -- but also seems to contemplate that some of its safe harbors could preempt state, federal or private enforcement. /6
But info sharing would be required under the sandbox program. 		That said, the policy proposal is meant to model the SEC's own NAL structure, which Mulvaney and Paul Watkins have repeatedly said was their goal. /5
Another provision that could make the NAL policy more attractive: it wouldn't put the same information sharing requirements on recipients (the existing policy implied data-sharing w/ the Bureau would help you keep your NAL--which could otherwise be revoked any time) /4
Remember when Mulvaney announced the Bureau would be looking to define that second "A" (abusive) in UDAAP? 		The new NAL proposal's likely to come into play there too. This contemplates making UDAAP safe harbors more common for NAL recipients... /3
It's not just for fintechs: a broad range of financial services companies, trade groups or third parties can apply to either program... /2

In response to Mick Mulvaney's presser, @SenWarren says Mulvaney doesn't like having a cop on the beat to prevent people from being defrauded by mortgage, student loan lenders &amp; other financial institutions
@ohno_mrbill Wouldn‚Äôt fall under a de minimus rule?
I'm running the agency as the law sets forth, Mulvaney says.
I'm just learning about the powers I have as a director, they would probably frighten you, Mulvaney says
My opinion of the structure of the CFPB has not changed, Mulvaney says: I still have the fundamental misgivings about the way this bureau is structured...
Mulvaney says timing for a permanent CFPB director will depend more on the Senate's timing than the president's, although the White House has yet to announce a  nominee.
If you had any doubt, sounds like Mulvaney is very clearly tapping the breaks on CFPB enforcement actions.
Mulvaney says POTUS wants him to "protect people without trampling on capitalism"
Mulvaney says he'll spend 3 days a week at CFPB, 3 at OMB.
The president has made it very clear he wants me hear (and my name is on the door now), Mulvaney says.
No payments out of the civil penalties fund, 30 day hiring freeze in effect at CFPB, Mulvaney says.
30 day IMMEDIATELY regulatory freeze on anything in the pipelines, Mulvaney says.
NOW: The way we interpret and enforce Dodd-Frank at the @CFPB will be dramatically different than under the Obama administration, OMB &amp; Trump-appointed Acting CFPB Director Mulvaney says

@GraphicStrick @EvanSparks @peteschroeder No offense taken. I appreciate you pointing that out.
@GraphicStrick @EvanSparks @peteschroeder Fair point. I should have said on a pro bono basis, instead. Thanks for flagging.
@EvanSparks Perhaps 2017 will be the Year of the Three CFPB Directors, once a nominee is announced (but before confirmed)
In non-CFPB news, I'm watching a posh BBC show about Bologna, Italy and they just started playing the theme for Curb Your Enthusiasm as background music. Very disconcerting.
@EvanSparks @peteschroeder I suppose it would depend on who, right? To be clear, I have no idea how the suit is being financed, I'm merely spitballing. It is an interesting question, though.
@EvanSparks @peteschroeder Perhaps she has some backers or the lawyers are on contingency?
Legal scholars told me over the weekend that this was the expected course of action. Seemed unlikely the CFPB itself could bring a suit due to the leadership ambiguity. https://t.co/Lx45HQlLzS
