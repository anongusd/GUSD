Feel free to share your #RandomActOfKindness for #Columbine in this thread.
For those who would never leave Columbine, 19 years ago today. 		Rachel Scott	Danny Rohrbough	Kyle Velasquez	Steve Curnow	Cassie Bernall	Isaiah Shoels	Matt Kechter	Lauren Townsend	John Tomlin	Kelly Fleming	Daniel Mauser	Corey DePooter	"Coach" Dave Sanders		Never forget.
First act is some chocolate for my son's teacher because - good grief -even if he was a class of one, she would be overworked and underappreciated. 		Then 12 blue flowers that we will pass out to students of all ages we cross paths with. 		12 students, 1 teacher.
19 years to the day. Hard for me to convey how that feels. More time than our student victims ever lived, and that hits hard. 		Today, remember #Columbine with kindness. I have 13 acts planned, with my kids.  		Wear orange, I am. #enough		Honor through action. Rock the vote.

@commiedropper @davidhogg111 You are making ridiculous assumptions that do nothing to further your argument.
@commiedropper @davidhogg111 And if we could get all states to submit background checks to existing database, implement red flsg laws, and enforce laws that are already on the books we could actually reduce the violence that plagues the inner cities instead of just using them as an argument against gun sense

@Dalton642 That's the ideal scenario. But I've been watching this for a long time (in terms of % of my life, anyway) and I don't believe it will happen. In the universe that 2A is repealed we have a potential civil war on our hands because of the pestulent tantrums that would ensue.
@DonnaLfromNY @Dalton642 The shootings will continue as long as we live in a country that has sexualized their weapons. Plumbers don't pose with their wrenches, and writers don't talk about how sexy their keyboard is. 		The culture is as problematic as the weapons.
@Dalton642 I don't believe it should be a right. Are you missing my point on purpose? Im saying a proposal to repeal the 2A will not pass because it won't. I would be pleased to be wrong about that, but I'm not. I've waited 19 years for the dialogue on gun control to change.
@Dalton642 I'm not stepping away. I stepped in front of my legislators last week to speak about gun reform. I'm saying that a proposed repeal of 2A would flounder DOA and reasonable people know that. It needs to be amended to reflect that it should be a limited right.

@arlene_loper @fred_guttenberg @Emma4Change Thanks, I had tried to reach out in February but i assume they've been totally swamped. Columbine stands with Douglas. 		Can we get some RTs?
While not 100% accurate, this thread does address the total failure of an argument behind the walk up not out idea. Which is terrible, btw, and blames victims. Which is also terrible. https://t.co/UZF5lxBrVb
@diannaeanderson This isn't really accurate either as the bombs werent even partially detonated before the shooting began outside. I was in the cafeteria then, and the adjacent auditorium when the bomb did explode.
@diannaeanderson But i do thank you for standing up to negate the idea that if we had just been more friendly they wouldn't have tried to kill us all.
@diannaeanderson Hi, i was a student at Columbine, a freshman that day. The shooters were not loners, that part is absolutely true. But in the upper class preppy atmosphere of Columbine they and their friends were outcasts in a way.
