@Stop_Trump20 I think it is way too soon for anyone to start their political campaigning. Too many things to work on. Everyone that was elected needs to get to work and get things done!! Otherwise voters will get discouraged and come 2020 we don't want another GOP majority.
@AP I think it is too soon we  need elected officials to work hard on all the things they promised! Healthcare, Infrastructure, equality for all, voter suppression, etc. There are just too many things to work on this year.
