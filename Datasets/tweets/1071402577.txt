As the 2009 bipartisan Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States stated: ‚ÄòPotential aggressors should have to worry about the possibility that the United States might respond by overwhelming means at a time and in a manner of its choosing.

That means any delay or any error, could put at risk our ability to field an effective nuclear deterrent in the future, and we cannot allow that to happen. In the face of growing threats, our deterrent must remain strong.
As a result of decisions to delay and defer funding, there is no margin for error in the schedule.
The command and control networks that our nuclear forces rely on are also in need of replacement, as is the scientific #infrastructure that maintains our stockpile of aging warheads.
As our nuclear deterrent becomes more important to our nation‚Äôs defense, the need for nuclear modernization only grows. This conclusion is echoed by the administration‚Äôs #NuclearPostureReview.
Meanwhile, our warheads and delivery systems age toward obsolescence, as does the #infrastructure that maintains our deterrent.
With #Russia and #China increasingly seeking to challenge US interests and reshape the geopolitical landscape in their favor, the unique role our nuclear forces play in deterring conflict &amp; preventing war is becoming increasingly important.
As part of the effort to ensure our military is prepared for new threats, we must continue modernizing our #nuclearforces.

I join Nebraskans and Americans across our country in saluting Matt‚Äôs bravery and #sacrifice. It is an honor to tell his story. #NEhero
Matt was a consistent source of inspiration for his fellow Marines, he was the kind of young man that people were just drawn to. He was tough yet a selfless Marine. #SemperFi
For his ultimate sacrifice, Corporal Matt Henderson received the naval achievement medal with cluster, a Purple Heart, and he was the first to receive the prestigious Non-Commissioned Officer Combat Engineer of the Year award posthumously.
Matt warned his squad to get back and take cover but was unable to get out of range himself. The remainder of his squad survived. #Leadership #Service #Sacrifice
As a squad leader, Matt was aware of and concerned about the dangers of his second deployment. On May 26, 2004, Matt was leading his squad in sweeping an area in the Al Anbar province of Iraq. During the sweep, Matt and two of his men were killed when an IED was detonated #NEhero
In February of 2004, Matt deployed to Iraq for the second time and Jaimie moved back to #Nebraska to be closer to their families.
Upon Matt‚Äôs return home in May of 2003, he and Jaimie finally had their big church wedding in Lincoln, NE. They moved to California where Matt was stationed.
During his deployment, Matt was chosen to be a squad leader due to his #leadership abilities &amp; the respect of the other Marines. Matt‚Äôs family had no communication with him during this time and watched the news every evening with the hopes of catching a glimpse of Matt.
In February of 2003, Matt deployed to Iraq where he joined other U.S. led forces in the invasion of Iraq from Kuwait in order to oust Saddam Hussein. #NEhero
On August 4, 2001, Matt proposed to his girlfriend Jaimie on Mission Beach in San Diego just after sunset. As they planned their wedding in Nebraska, Matt‚Äôs unit was informed they would be among the first forces to invade Iraq.
Due to his strong interest in the construction field, Matt also finished Combat Engineer School at Camp Lejeune, and he was assigned to the 1st Combat Engineers Battalion at Camp Pendleton.
In 2000, Matt joined the @USMC because he was attracted to the discipline &amp; direction it offered. He completed boot camp at @MCRD_SD before attending &amp; completing infantry training at @MCIWPendletonCA. #Service
Matt loved sports and was a devout @Huskers and @ChicagoBears fan. #GBR #Tradition
After Matt‚Äôs father finished veterinary school, he moved the family to the Good Life. As Matt grew up, he made many friends and could be found by his dad‚Äôs side on equine veterinary visits.

Extending this tax-credit would give businesses more time to establish #PaidFamilyLeave and ensure this program is working for families. More on #PaidFamilyLeavePilotExtensionAct in my press release with @SenAngusKing &amp; @SenDeanHeller ‚û°Ô∏è¬†https://t.co/qmcaLGFYEb
Now that this guidance is out, I encourage employers, especially small businesses, to take advantage of this opportunity to offer #PaidFamilyLeave. The program provides working families more #flexibility as they balance caring for their loved ones with work obligations. https://t.co/7HDICmlTIz
Our bill would extend the tax credit to give businesses more time to implement a program, expand #PaidFamilyLeave for employees, and allow lawmakers to access sufficient data to assess the effectiveness of the program. Read the bill here ‚û°Ô∏è: https://t.co/XY4xauGB8d
Because the guidance on using the credit was not issued until today @SenAngusKing @SenDeanHeller and I have introduced new legislation: The #PaidFamilyLeavePilotExtensionAct.
Under current law, the program is a two-year tax credit. This was intended to give Congress the opportunity to determine its effectiveness.
The policy is targeted to hourly employees who would not otherwise have access to #PaidFamilyLeave. Employees who participate cannot make more than $72,000 per year. https://t.co/bUuuhOuX09
In exchange for offering #PaidFamilyLeave, employers will receive as much as a 25% tax credit for the amount of wages replaced. #StrongFamiliesAct https://t.co/cJJBXzuEqu
Through this historic and voluntary program, employers can offer up to 12 weeks of #PaidFamilyLeave. The leave can be used to take care of a family member or utilized for maternity or paternity leave with biological or adopted children. https://t.co/Q8Hq0zup95

RT @ALZNebraska: @SenatorFischer signed to co-sponsor the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act Monday! We are heading to the #alzforum i‚Ä¶
Sergeant First Class Tricia Jameson loved her family, she embodied the pride of her state and the values of our nation. #NEHeroes #Service üá∫üá∏
For her service to our nation, Sergeant First Class Tricia Jameson earned many military decorations, including the Purple Heart and Bronze Star posthumously. #NEHeroes #Service
Sgt. Jameson‚Äôs name and reputation live on as soldiers save lives, just as she did, on the battlefield.
Without hesitation, Sgt. Jameson answered the call. She was speeding towards the battlefield to attend to the fallen when her field ambulance was struck by an IED. That day, she gave her life while serving her country.
Sgt. Jameson and her battle buddy, Specialist Rachelle Spors received an urgent call to help injured Marines in combat a few miles from where they were.
By June of 2005, Sgt. Jameson was in Iraq on duty with the 313th Medical Company at Camp Speicher. Jameson‚Äôs first mission on the road was a long one. She was the vehicle commander of an M997 ambulance that was headed to Trebil near the Jordan border.
With her determination, she raised that program into a world-class operation. The soldiers who took her program went on to save lives around the world.
As combat intensified in #Afghanistan and #Iraq, Tricia was tasked with improving the Combat Life Saver course, which teaches soldiers basic medical skills for the battlefield.
After high school, Tricia joined the @NENationalGuard in 1994. With her grit and determination, she soon was promoted to become a full-time training instructor at Camp Ashland.
Tricia grew up in the farm country of St. Paul, NE, and at a young age, she advocated for what is right and how others should be treated.
Each Nebraska hero has a powerful story, and today, I‚Äôm honoring the life of @NENationalGuard Sergeant First Class Tricia Jameson.

Sergeant Lonnie ‚ÄúCalvin‚Äù Allen, Jr. received the Bronze Star and a Purple Heart for his service to our country. #NEHeroes
Bellevue also honored him by naming a street after him and his high school established the Sgt. Lonnie Calvin Allen, Jr. Scholarship.
Sergeant Allen‚Äôs memorial service was held at the Capehart Chapel in Bellevue. Over five-hundred people attended the standing-room-only ceremony to pay their respects, including over two hundred #PatriotRiders.
During Sergeant Allen‚Äôs second deployment, patrols became increasingly dangerous. On May 18, 2006 Seargeant Allen‚Äôs Humvee was struck by an IED, which killed him and three other service members.
Shortly after their marriage, Calvin served in Iraq for the first time and Birgit moved to Bellevue to be closer to Calvin‚Äôs family while he was deployed. After a brief stint home, he deployed to Iraq for a second time. #NEHeroes
Following his enlistment, Calvin soon shipped off to Fort Benning to complete his One Station Unit Training for the infantry. Shortly after graduation, he was assigned to a station in Germany. It was in Germany where Calvin met his wife, Birgit
Although many expected he'd follow in his dad's footsteps by enlisting in the Air Force, his mother knew better: Calvin wanted to pave his own road in the Army. #NEHeroes #ProudNebraskan
Calvin had a caring attitude, which extended to church on Sundays. He often volunteered to be an usher and displayed his musical talent in the choir. #NELeaders
Calvin grew up in a military family. When his dad, Lonnie Sr., was assigned to @Offutt_AFB in Bellevue, he &amp; his wife Sallie thought they would only be there for a short time. However, they enjoyed "the good life" and soon after the birth of their two sons, they decided to stay.
Today, I will recall the life and service of Sergeant Lonnie "Calvin" Allen Jr., a native of Bellevue, Nebraska. #NEHeroes

According to @UNICEF food waste and supply chain losses comprise approximately 30% of worldwide food production #IoT
Combined yield enhancement and resource savings from new technologies can increase American farmers‚Äô profits by an average of $40 per acre #IoT
A recent 6-month pilot study found IoT-enabled precision agriculture improved overall crop productivity by 15%
With the world‚Äôs population expected to exceed 9 billion people by 2050, there are estimates that ag production must at least double to feed our global communities #FeedTheWorld
More than one third of Nebraska‚Äôs GDP comes from rural, primarily agricultural, areas #NEag
Nebraska‚Äôs farms and ranches utilize 45.2 million acres ‚Äì or 91% of the state‚Äôs total land area.
#Agriculture is the third fastest growing sector of #IoT
One in four jobs in Nebraska is #agriculture related #NEag
Check out these quick facts about #agriculture &amp; #technology:

Chief Warrant Officer Allgaier‚Äôs memorial service was held on June 6th, at a Catholic church in Omaha. Hundreds of people, including over a hundred #PatriotRiders, turned out to pay their final respects.
On the night of May 30, 2007, Chris flew a night operation transporting approximately 30 service members. Shortly after dropping the soldiers off for their important mission, insurgents shot down his CH-47 Chinook, killing Chris and four other service members. #NEheroes
In 2007, Chris‚Äôs unit deployed to Afghanistan. He flew CH-47 Chinook helicopters in transport missions. The Upper Sangin Valley in the Helmand Province was the center of fighting in Afghanistan in 2007.  A British newspaper called it ‚Äúthe deadliest area in Afghanistan.‚Äù
Chief Warrant Officer Allgaier deployed to South Korea for over a year prior to going to Afghanistan in 2003 and Iraq in 2005.
Due to his strong academic record and interest in aeronautics, Chris was persuaded to apply for Warrant Officer Candidate School. He graduated at the top of his class and became a helicopter pilot.
Shortly after receiving his bachelor‚Äôs degree, Chris enlisted in the @USArmy. He graduated from Basic Combat Training in Fort Jackson before attending his Advanced Individual Training in aviation mechanics. #Service
During Chris‚Äôs senior year at Creighton Prep, he became interested in fixed wing aircraft and flying. After high school graduation, Chris continued his studies at St. Louis University, where he studied aeronautical administration.
Growing up, Chris lived a pretty typical life for a Nebraska boy. He ate at his favorite pizza place with his family, cheered on the #Huskers, and attended St. Robert Bellarmine Catholic Church in Omaha with his parents, sister, Sharon, and brother, Rob.

RT @amyklobuchar: @SenatorFischer, thank you for your leadership in passing the bill to mandate sex harassment training in the Senate.
This bill is six years in the making and is the product of more than 70 committee hearings. My priority throughout this process will remain fighting for middle-class families. #TaxReform
The release of the Senate tax reform proposal is a key step toward achieving our goals of providing relief for middle-class families, reducing burdens on small businesses, and making America more competitive.

As I‚Äôve said repeatedly, the rising #NorthKorea threat reinforces the need for increased US missile defenses to protect the American people.

We must change our strategy to protect Americans. Secondary sanctions and enhanced #MissileDefense should form the basis of our approach.
Kim Jong-un has threatened to attack US cities w/ nuclear weapons. His capability to carry out this threat grows w every passing day
‚Äúno good options‚Äù is frequently repeated when confronting the NK threat. This may be true, but the gravity of the situation demands action.
I plan to hold hearings in @SASCmajority #STRATFOR subcmte to examine #administrations #MissileDefense review proposed way forward.
The #administration is conducting the first review of ballistic missile threats &amp; our missile defense posture since 2010 #MissileDefense
Deploying more interceptors would add capacity and enable our defenses to better handle ICBM threats #NorthKorea
Rate of NK‚Äôs technical progress demands response eg additional ground-based radars &amp; space-based sensors to impve ability to track threats
As chairman of @SASCmajority #STRATFOR subcmte I work w #MissileDefenseAgency directors &amp; STRATCOM commanders to impve our #MissileDefense
We cannot rely on deterrence alone. We must ensure that our missile defense efforts stay ahead of #NorthKorea's accelerating developments.
The Chinese view #NorthKorea through a narrow lens of immediate strategic interest. That is how we must target our actions.
One thing is certain: the principle economic enablers of #NorthKorea are China and Russia.
NK ICBM developments reveal sophisticated program that is pursuing weapons designed for no other purpose than to threaten the U.S. &amp; allies
Last month NK conducted 2 ICBM tests. A number of reports say the 2nd test demonstrated sufficient range to reach much of the United States.
TUNE IN: I will speak on the floor regarding the #NorthKorea threat &amp; U.S. missile defense. https://t.co/bYKRseNmCL

Corporal Matthew Alexander is truly a hero. He served with compassion &amp; respect. It is an honor to tell his story. #NEheroes
As Matthew‚Äôs father Mel put it, ‚ÄúMatthew had two passions, music and the military.‚Äù
To honor Matthew, his family established Matt‚Äôs Music Memorial. The charity helps children who love music but can‚Äôt afford an instrument
Corporal Alexander was laid to rest on May 18, 2007 in Nebraska. Over 1500 people attended to say their final goodbyes.
On May 6th Matthew spoke to his mother &amp; Kara for the last time. A few days later an IED detonated near him, killing him instantly.
When Mathew returned to Baqubah, Iraq his unit encountered fierce fighting likened to the close-quarters combat of #Vietnam.
He returned home from combat and in February of 2007 married his childhood sweetheart, Kara, on Valentine‚Äôs Day.
Matthew‚Äôs unit deployed to Mosul, Iraq where they assisted with the training of the Iraqi militia #OperationIraqiFreedom
Matthew enlisted in the Army shortly before graduating from Gretna High School in May of 2004 and shipped off to Basic Training that summer
Matthew always wanted to be a soldier, but the 9/11 terrorist attacks further solidified his desire to defend our country. #USA
Today I rise to honor the life &amp; service of Army Corporal Matthew Alexander, a native of Gretna, Nebraska. #NEheroes

Bill Bailey is a true Nebraska hero. I am honored to tell his story. #NEHeroes #ProudNebraskan
Bill was a wonderful husband, brother, son, father. He dedicated quite a bit of his life to helping other people. #NEHeroes
Specialist Bailey earned several military awards including the Purple Heart, Bronze Star, Iraqi Campaign Medal &amp; Combat Action Badge. #Honor
More than one thousand people gathered in Bellevue to remember Bill. #NEHeroes
On May 25, 2007, during a security escort mission, Bill‚Äôs vehicle struck an improvised explosive device. Bill Bailey was killed. #NEHeroes
By 2007, the insurgency in Iraq had erupted to new levels of violence. Increased American forces sought to destroy the al Qaeda network.
In 2006, his unit was deployed and assigned to provide security escorts for truck convoys operating out of Balad Air Base in #Iraq.
That deep desire to serve the country continued to tug at him. In 2005, Bill re-enlisted in the @NENationalGuard #Courage
Bill‚Äôs protective nature made him a great father. It also made him a great firefighter. #NeHeroes
After 9/11, Bill felt the call to serve his country again. But, first things first. Bill and Dee married in 2004.
In December 2000, Bill met Dee. She was a bank teller at Wells Fargo; he drove an armored truck. They met through a service window.
Bill attended Bellevue East where the call to protect his country prompted him to enlist in the @NENationalGuard in 1995.

Let‚Äôs take advantage of this moment when we have common ground on a commonsense and straightforward legislation for #EqualPay #Bipartisan
Most importantly this bill is possible: 53 Republican and 5 Dem Senators supported a version of the #WorkplaceAdvancementAct last Congress.
Many congressional Democrats requested and even praised an Obama executive order with similar language to my proposal #EqualPay
Importantly for employers, the #WorkplaceAdvancementAct wouldn't impose new federal regulations or mandates
With this flexibility, women can better negotiate arrangements that make sense for them. #Flexibility
When employees, especially women, have more information, they can confidently pursue favorable work and wage arrangements #KnowledgeIsPower
A culture of silence and fear of retaliation can keep people in the dark about how their wages compare to others‚Äô #KnowledgeIsPower
The #WorkplaceAdvancementAct would empower women with info about wages so they can be informed advocates for themselves.
I‚Äôve reintro‚Äôd the #WorkplaceAdvancementAct based on a simple idea: equal pay through empowerment #KnowledgeIsPower https://t.co/4ifgWsmas9

The #DIGITAct is a bipartisan bill. Both parties understand the need to position the US as a #IoT world leader.
The #DIGITAct will bring together a working group of federal agencies &amp; private sector stakeholders to develop #IoT
Cooperation between the private and public sectors is essential to develop the #IoT.

He is a true Nebraska hero, and I am honored to tell his story. #SergeantGermaineDebro #NEHeroes
His military decorations include a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. #Courage
Germaine Debro was promoted posthumously to the rank of sergeant. #NEheroes
On September 18, 2006, the Morning Star Baptist Church near downtown Omaha was filled with people paying a final tribute to Sgt. Debro.
Sergeant Josiah Warren, riding in the right seat, tried unsuccessfully to pull Germaine free. Sgt. Debro died on 9/4/06
Thirty miles outside Baghdad, Germaine‚Äôs Humvee struck an improvised explosive device.
On September 4, 2006, a 20-truck convoy headed out from a site 30 miles north of Baghdad.
Germaine‚Äôs unit was right in the thick of it. Enemy attacks were frequent. Tensions were high.
After a year of training, the First of the 167th Cavalry arrived in Iraq in early 2006. That‚Äôs when the Sunni-Shia civil war erupted.
In 2005, Germaine learned his unit, the First of the 167th Cavalry of the @NEnationalGuard, would deploy to Iraq.
Germaine deployed to Kuwait in 2001 and to Bosnia in 2002. #ProudNebraskan #NEheroes
In 1994, ‚ÄúG.I. Joe Maine‚Äù followed his calling and enlisted in the #Army and in 1997 joined the @NEnationalguard
Germaine Debro seemed destined for military service. At a young age, he picked up a nick name: ‚ÄúG.I. Joe Maine.‚Äù #NEheroes

Cpt Yllescas of Osceola, NE is an American hero. It was my honor to tell his story on the Senate floor #NEheroes https://t.co/7gXno8h8GZ
Captain Robert Yllescas embodied the pride of his state, served his country, and loved his family. #ProudNebraskan
Ultimately, Rob‚Äôs severe leg and head wounds were too much to overcome. Captain Robert Yllescas died on Dec. 1, 2008.
During Rob‚Äôs time at Bethesda Naval Medical Center, President George W. Bush visited him &amp; personally awarded him the #PurpleHeart.
Rob was quickly evacuated out of Afghanistan, stabilized, and moved to the Bethesda Naval Medical Center.
On October 28, 2008, a remotely-controlled IED was detonated and seriously wounded Captain Yllescas.
Rob achieved the rank of #Captain and deployed to Afghanistan in 2008 and stationed at Camp Keating, known to many as dangerous territory.
Returning home to #Nebraska in 2006, Rob continued to excel in the military, later graduating from Army Ranger School. #RangersLeadTheWay
He deployed to Iraq in 2003 for a year &amp; then returned for a 2nd deployment in 2005, when the fighting grew more intense.
In 2001, Rob received his commission as a Second Lieutenant in the @USArmy. #ArmyStrong
At @UNLincoln, he fell in love with his wife Dena and they were married on July 29, 2000.
Rob enrolled in the @NENationalGuard while in college at @UNLincoln with hopes of becoming a general one day. #NEHeroes

Two months later, on August 7, 2011, Josh was out on patrol and shot twice by enemy combatants. He died shortly after.
He would later earn the Bronze Star for his actions that day. #ProudNebraskan #SemperFi
A few months later, on June 11, a fire fight broke out lasting six hours. During the attack, Josh rescued a wounded Marine. #Hero
After serving two tours in Iraq, he was deployed to Helmand Province, Afghanistan in March of 2011.
Josh‚Äôs fellow Marines say he was fearless. #SemperFi
By 2003, Josh had enlisted in the #Marine Corps. That year, he also met the love of his life, Rhonda Zaruba of Bennington, NE.
On 9/11, terrorist attacks on our homeland changed the world and instilled a deep sense of #duty and #patriotism for Josh.

Kicking off Q&amp;A on #equalpay &amp; #paidleave at @AEI. Watch: Webcast ‚Üí https://t.co/4w9U54EiEO
I believe we can achieve meaningful change that can help both #employees and #businesses thrive. #paidleave 14/14 https://t.co/57t62QFbjx
Whether it‚Äôs #EqualPay or #PaidLeave, the issues that matter to American workers are evolving. This progress demands solutions. 13/14
No one should live w/ the fear that welcoming a new baby or taking an elderly parent to the doctor could mean losing a job #paidleave 12/14
Rigid mandates can actually hurt workers‚Äô ability to negotiate unique arrangements with employers. 11/14
Every situation is different, &amp; by providing more options, workers can determine how each can suit their own needs. #paidleave 10/14
In Nov I joined Sen Angus King of Maine to reintro a bill that encourages employers to voluntarily offer paid leave to their employees 9/14
I believe it‚Äôs possible to find a middle ground on #equalpay &amp; #paidleave that respects both #families &amp; employers 8/14
An ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù attitude only prevents #progress &amp; leaves us with the false choices &amp; stereotypes that have persisted for decades. 7/14
I believe that every #AmericanWorker should have the ability to discuss compensation w/out fear of retribution. https://t.co/gwrz9bJhIL 6/14
To make a difference in the lives of working #families, we must build bipartisan consensus. 5/14 https://t.co/RbWU2iqR0O
We should be empowering both employers &amp; employees to #negotiate flexible work arrangements to best meet their individual needs. 4/14
Current law doesn‚Äôt adequately protect workers against retaliation for openly discussing their salaries. #equalpay 3/14
I want to put a stop to unfair pay practices. This starts by breaking the barriers to open discussion. #equalpay 2/14
I believe that #Congress has a duty to promote policies that will make life easier &amp; more flexible for American #families. 1/14
NOW: I‚Äôm speaking at @AEI on #PaidLeave &amp; #EqualPay. Tune in here: https://t.co/TErY4VnHkV

Honored to receive the 2016 Distinguished Community Health Advocate Award from @HCANebraska. #HealthyCommunities  https://t.co/mK3RlfQkC4
1st Lt Jacob Fritz is a hero, and I am honored to tell his story. #NEHeroes 12/12
Jake‚Äôs memory lives on in the hearts and minds of the state he served. Nebraskans are forever indebted to his sacrifice. 11/12
Jake was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Prisoner of War Medal, and the Combat Action Badge. 10/12
First Lieutenant Jacob Fritz received full military honors was laid to rest in Verdon, NE on January 31, 2007. 9/12
When American troops arrived at the scene, they saw his body and the word ‚ÄúFritz.‚Äù #Courage #Honor 8/12
Mortally wounded, Jake knew he wouldn‚Äôt be identified and managed to scrawl a few letters in the dust. #NEHereos 7/12
Jake and 3 other soldiers were taken hostage, stripped of their identification, and shot as the militants fled the scene. 6/12
Shortly after he arrived, on January 20, 2007, enemy militants disguised as friendly soldiers, entered Karbala and attacked. 5/12
Lieutenant Fritz had a natural instinct to step up and take charge. He felt an obligation and commitment to the mission. 4/12
In 2006, Jake was deployed to Iraq as a Lieutenant with the 2nd Battalion 3/12
Jake graduated from @WestPoint_USMA in 2005 with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in systems engineering. 2/12
Jake Fritz grew up on his family‚Äôs farm near Verdon, Nebraska, a town with less than 200 people. 1/12

He met his wife Jenny at a football game at @UNKearney 4/11
In civilian life Jeff became a #Kearney police officer, &amp; later joined the @DeptVetAffairs Police Force in Grand Island 3/11
Jeff exhibited outstanding leadership as a member of Troop A in the 1-167th Cavalry of the @NENationalGuard 2/11

Yet, I believe that our very best days as a nation are ahead.
or grandparents concerned about the future we will leave our grandchildren, there is no shortage of anxiety.
Whether it‚Äôs hardworking parents trying to make ends meet
I know many families across our state and across our nation are worried.
and creating flexible options for working families remain at the forefront of my priorities.
Building a stronger Nebraska, giving Americans more opportunities and more certainty‚Ä¶
There is more work to do.
to funding our military and passing policies to help prevent suicide among our veterans, we acted on the will of the American people.
From enacting a multi-year highway bill and reforming our education system...
Last year, we were able to make progress on many big issues.
By working together, we can deliver meaningful results and a brighter future for the American people.
To provide real and lasting solutions, we need a positive vision to unite behind and move forward.
Our nation faces many challenges, from escalating dangers abroad to limited economic opportunities here at home. #SOTU

Mr. President, what is your top priority? Mine is providing for the natl defense. #SignIt
It‚Äôs time for #POTUS to make #NDAA his top priority.
The federal government has no higher obligation than protecting our nation &amp; providing for our national security.
Instead, he vetoed the NDAA based on a partisan, political demand to spend taxpayer dollars on the EPA &amp; IRS.
#POTUS‚Äô objections have nothing to do with our national security.
Our military needs the authorities contained in this bill to perform its missions &amp; defend our nation.
As we have seen from the ever-growing list of global threats, these dangers are only increasing.
This year‚Äôs #NDAA is a #bipartisan compromise that meets the budgetary levels requested by #POTUS
It‚Äôs disappointing to see our commander in chief playing political games at the expense of our military.
