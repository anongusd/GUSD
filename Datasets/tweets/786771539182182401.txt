Don't let it fail on your watch.  @POTUS Help save America's healthcare system, then take credit for fixing it.  #WINWIN
A step in the right direction #bipartisan @GOP @TheDemocrats https://t.co/m8OSE9zzQo

@GOP Trump supporters would not recognize a fact if it hit them in the face, but the reality is they are not alone.  https://t.co/WLQaBN3zzZ
@realDonaldTrump No problem... use your business skills to negotiate "the best" deal.  Unless you picked up those "skills" @TrumpUniversity then just give up
@KingAndrewCuomo In lieu of facts you turn to fantasy.  @KingAndrewCuomo you are better than that.
@KingAndrewCuomo Haha is that the minimum buy in?  I guess I'll consider you muting me "a good start" (Do you get the reference? See your profile header)
@KingAndrewCuomo the challenge is:  people like you assume when you disagree them, that you must support their enemy; which is not accurate.
@KingAndrewCuomo Thanks buddy!! Honestly, I don't think you understand it and probably don't mean that.  The reality is people are too distracted too notice.
@KingAndrewCuomo You are still trying to argue a position I never disagreed with you on.  Too bad, you are living a lie my friend.  I hope you get help!
@KingAndrewCuomo Hahahah who's this "they" you keep referring to comrade?
@KingAndrewCuomo You know I never denied anything about the clintons or obamas.  Nice try on creating a false narrative though!  It really was a nice effort!
@KingAndrewCuomo @PolitiFact At this point I'm not sure you even know what you're arguing for... which is incredibly entertaining for me!  Thanks big guy
@KingAndrewCuomo Unless you just like lying, then I guess there is a benefit.  So carry on I suppose.  I'll call you out, but also play along!
@KingAndrewCuomo Almost nobody is reading this.  You realize that right?  There is no need to make up lies because I obviously won't believe them.
@KingAndrewCuomo @PolitiFact You're funny.  I love it when people talk themselves in circles.  Maybe you could be next POTUS?  #justhinkaboutit
@KingAndrewCuomo @KingAndrewCuomo Thanks for the shoutout!  This is what it looks like when ignorant people try to tear down people who disagree with them.
@KingAndrewCuomo @PolitiFact To clarify, are you suggesting that when you cannot find information you think it is ok to make stuff up to fill in your knowledge gaps?
@KingAndrewCuomo @PolitiFact Haha you're certainly persistant, but where did you read that lie? Not on my page and that's a fact.
@KingAndrewCuomo @GovChristie @KingAndrewCuomo Where do you get your information? Oh never mind #Russianpropaganda
@PolitiFact can someone please help this person understand the difference between fact and fiction? https://t.co/nOK37IpkUB

@Alt_CNN @GovChristie It's a metaphor; I'm sorry it's confusing for you. I suppose I could try harder to help you understand, but for what purpose? To what end?
@KingAndrewCuomo @GovChristie No need for name calling, unless it makes you feel better.  Can you show me where you think I suggested it was "nothing"?
@KingAndrewCuomo @GovChristie Do you know what the golden rule is?
@KingAndrewCuomo @GovChristie You are misquoting again, re-read, slower this time.  Also, the golden rule is "treat people how you want to be treated"... and I am. #facts
@KingAndrewCuomo @GovChristie Meaningless words. Translations are only valid if the interpreter thoroughly understands both languages; or in this case ideologies.
@KingAndrewCuomo @GovChristie Pointing to wrong doing as a justification for wrong doing doesn't make you right.  Right and wrong, in this case, is black and white.
@Alt_CNN @GovChristie I'm sorry you feel that way. It was answered as simply as it could be possibly answered. If you still don't understand, then you never will.
