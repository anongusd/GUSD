@Sam38G @robmart437 My adult life in the government sector has put me in a world where there are too many policies not to offend anyone. We walk on egg shells all the time.
@Sam38G @robmart437 This is also a great example why I feel so naive. Even this give each other a hard time, one could file suite against someone and get them fired. This is rare in my work environment.
@Sam38G @robmart437 My girlfriend loves your picture, thinks you are beautiful and cheering you on for every comment you make.
@Sam38G @robmart437 She would beat my ass if I did anything. She does not want anyone to stand up for her.
@Sam38G @robmart437 Wish it were that easy - OMG I wish it would be so.... You would go completely nuts working within the constraints of a government office environment. Policies tend to be the tools by management hides behind.
@Sam38G @robmart437 agreed - but we have policies to make it where I could get fired for doing what you just said. Everything has to follow a policy or procedure.
@Sam38G @robmart437 We work on different areas of work. So there is nothing for me to even know about until she vents to me later and it would hurt her if I said anything. Again if it were private sector and not government I an unsure if it would be different.
@Sam38G @robmart437 In the government that is not allowed or even close to how anything can work. In private sector you probably could but I would not know.
@Sam38G @robmart437 Within the construct of where I work - it only works if the individual files and no one else other than that individual can file a complaint. It sucks but that is how the policies are written from congress down to the agencies.

@Sam38G @robmart437 Seems no matter the progress we make we are still live in the dark on how we treat others. Was raised by my sister. She taught me what I should or shouldn't do and always treat everyone with respect.
