@realDonaldTrump @GovernorKayIvey There are other places in dire need too.  Many are still recovering from Hurricanes, fires, flooding . . . . yet you want to spend their tax dollar on a wall?
@senatemajldr I am not happy with it either, but it is better than being a Trumplikin.  Bring the Republican party back!!!  Stop following Trump like a sheep and stand up for what is right~
@realDonaldTrump @AriFleischer When you speak of "the President" in the 3rd person it sounds like you are distancing yourself from "him" too.  You do realize, I hope, that "he" did not win the popular vote and it is not the will of the people - just a few.
@realDonaldTrump Presidential Harassment describes the way you treat the media and any one who does not agree with you.  Lying to the public is also Presidential Harassment.  In two years you have managed to divide the country.
@ananavarro I wish both much happiness.
@RanttMedia They did great in "their country."  The USA is their country and they were elected to office by citizens of the U.S.A.  what is it that you don't understand about a fair election?
@realDonaldTrump Don't pat yourself on the back for fixing the problems you created.
@ananavarro Congratulations.  You will be beautiful in your dress - breathing is not an option on your special day. LOL.  Make the world go away and concentrate on your love and yourself.  BE HAPPY!

@DanRather Kind of like  throwing the fox in with the chickens isn't it?
@DanRather He doesn't realize that we don't need to see his college transcripts to know he is not well educated.  We do not need to see his tax returns to know he is a crook and a liar.
@senatemajldr The President was more concerned about Cohen's testimony than he was in any nuclear settlement.  He has forgotten he had a "border crisis" - get your head out of the "sand".
@jdickerson A breath of fresh air has been added!
@wvjoe911 . . . and the problem is???
@DonaldJTrumpJr @MailOnline Did you forget you have a "major crisis" at the southern border?  Hordes of outlaws pouring in?  You have harped on Cohen's testimony much more than you have discussed the failure of an agreement on  de-nuclearization.
I’m helping @SCJohnson build a 9th @PlasticBank recycling center. SCJ is building 8 centers, but if we help spread the word they'll build 9. Tweet #SCJRecycles to show your support.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Don't you have something Presidential you should be doing rather than Tweeting?
@realDonaldTrump My husband found it "very interesting" as a medic in Chu Lai while you were "suffering" from bone spurs.  He died having night mares - you live giving them.
@Alan3091 @MeghanMcCain I hope Meghan reads this and understands that she needs to  give the others a chance, and listen to what they say, not simply yelling and disrupting.
@AAnterasian @MeghanMcCain Takes young children away from their parents and locks them in cages.
@realDonaldTrump This will be remembered as another ignorant statement you have made.  Don't you have advisors to tell you facts before you tweet in ignorance?  We do realize you can't read but . . can you listen?
@MeghanMcCain If you would learn to talk, not yell, you might have made a point this morning.  Next step  - when Sonny starts to give a rebuttal, be still and listen.  You might accidentally learn something rather than acting childish.  By the way - I am Republican, I am Pro-Life.
@terril49 @MeghanMcCain @TheView @IMKristenBell I too was very upset an I am a Republican.   @MeghanMcCain, interrupting, yelling, making faces and weird noises is not an adult debate.  You had your say, Sonny needed to have a chance at rebuttal.  Stop yelling - it only pisses us off, not make us smarter!
@HoarseWisperer @realDonaldTrump I really don't think "thinking" is the word you waned to use.  It is quite obvious that is rare in the DT world.
@realDonaldTrump I am not a Harry Reid Fan, but he was a hell of a lot better man than you.  He accomplished a lot of good for the State of Nevada.  He did not get "thrown out" - he retired.  You should try that too.
@realDonaldTrump why is the summit scheduled for Mar-a-Lago?  I am sick and tired of tax payer money going to your personal properties for your "meetings" and "golf games".  You profit when a Secret Service agent eats, sleeps in a room, plus the additional security that has to be put in place.
@itsJeffTiedrich He is worshiping the "God like: person he sees in the mirror as he prepares to go golfing.  He worships at the alter of Trump.
@jdickerson I don't have a clue what they are talking about, so my very snooty answer would be, "that is privileged information I do not wish to disclose at this time."  That works if you walk away fast before you bust out laughing.
@mommamia1217 @myserenity69 Gracie drags a toy like that through the house.
@stucam7771 @MissNyetTrump I have noticed this too.  I think we are feeling Trump Fatigue.   He can't let up on his lies, his tweets, calling every thing that is reported Fake News even when they show it coming out of his mouth . . .
@JeffFlake The Republican's that are looking forward to re-election in 2020 better take a hard look at what happened in the mid terms and vote with the Dems on this resolution.
@ananavarro sorry to get your hopes up with only two hours left in the week.  I'm on Pacific time so . . still time for stupid to evolve into criminal.
@wvjoe911 @politicususa An innocent person would allow the public to see what is in the Mueller Report.  A guilty one would send a flunky out to tell us to "move on."  In my mind he is guilty so it is his call if he releases it - I'd never  vote for him.
@CoryBooker Happy Birthday Alma.  You are still a beauty!
@realDonaldTrump @JussieSmollett I am sure they are very disappointed that it was MAGA who made the attack.  Is that why they are insulted?  They wanted it to be true????
@LgbtResistance You seem to think the same way I do, but have a much better way of expressing it.
@ananavarro Thanks for asking - I didn't know either.  I'm sure enjoying seeing you on The View!
@JoeBarri Maybe someone can explain it to him in simple words that he can understand.

@realDonaldTrump I am proud to say I live in one of those states and was born in another one of them.  I am a Republican, believe we need immigration reform, do not need your wall while military personnel are living in homes with mold or worse.
@realDonaldTrump They did just fine with my "all time favorite President".  You are not that man.  Try telling the truth, and see how that works out for you.
@itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump I agree - I'm old, I'm lazy, I set on my ass all day watching TV, I tweet - why don't  people think I'm great?  Is it because I'm not fat or dye myself orange?😆😆
@realDonaldTrump Running a little scared?  Limbaugh will say anything to get an audience.  You are President and should state facts - he can just say anything.

@WhiteHouse we all want secure borders.  Modern technology can help with that.  Locking children up away from their parents is only encouraging more terrorism when they are adults.  Walls are not the answer.  Steel slats can be cut!

@realDonaldTrump Please stop listening to the voices in your head.  "Many people" trust the media.  Your tweets do nothing to change our minds.
@realDonaldTrump Has it entered your mind to stop the shut down and PAY those border agents? #TrumpShutdown is costing billions  and you are unwilling to compromise. This is NOT a Dictator ship although you sure are trying.
@wvjoe911 Dictatorship?  Government workers are made to work without pay - so are they slaves who cannot talk about their hardships?

@jaketapper My translation:  "Since you won't give me my wall, I'll tell the terrorist that you are coming into their area.  Take Commercial - I don't want to lose a plane."   He doesn't have the balls to go, so he endangers her and others.
@wvjoe911 Did someone forget to tell the Judge about equal rights for all?  This is 2019 not 1919.
@SenWarren @senatemajldr Look on the bright side @SenWarren  - The Republicans are holding government employees from getting paid.  They will pay in 2020!  They forget these employee's and their families vote too.  Hang in there and keep trying.
@terril49 #TrumpShutdown started the "National Emergency".
@wvjoe911 Re-open the government first before you lose a lot of good employee's.  Compromise is not a dirty word - talk in a civil manner and miracles will occur.

@realDonaldTrump I visualize all those players dressed up for a  nice dinner, seeing the card board boxes on the table.  Did they eat standing up?  Maybe have to lean over to keep the overloaded ketchup from getting on them?  Cold burgers sound just wonderful - NOT

@wvjoe911 Help me understand - Trump is hurting the country.  A reporter reports the facts. The Reporter goes to jail?  we've already seen reporters called liars when they write what we have just head from Trumps mouth.
@stucam7771 True.  It is easier to discuss differences of opinion with men than with women.  Men will listen and debate.  A woman will get emotional and go over your head to management.
@ava They all arrived dressed to have a nice dinner and were served in cardboard boxes.  Why the Hell didn't he hire a catering firm to serve a decent dinner????

@AdamSchiff This is the dumbest of all dumb things.  People all over are still suffering from the effects of the hurricane, fires and other natural disasters.  Open the government so new first responders can be hired, those on duty will be paid and keep our country strong!
@WhiteHouse End the shut down now.  The cost of leaving the government shut down is higher than paying for the damned wall.  Is there anyone who can put some sense into #ImpeachTrump?  You will all be the next to go if this continues.
@realDonaldTrump Reminder - you lost the popular vote.  Government employee's are voters too and in the rural area's, they are Republican.  I just talked to some in the grocery store who said how much they regret that now when they see the way you treat them.
@bjcreigh @ellievan65 take a bite.  If you don't break a tooth - smear cream cheese on it ad eat it.
@SenSchumer @WhiteHouse Please send a letter to all utility companies, cred card companies, mortgage companies, land lords . .  anyone who expects a payment on time each month.  Or better yet - walk a mile in their shoes and see how it works -living payday to payday because of rising costs.
@SenTedCruz @CBP IDIOT!  Trump shut the government down and stated on National TV he would be proud to do it.  He also told Schumer he would not blame the Democrats.  HOW DID THAT CHANGE - and yes, I am yelling at you.
@realDonaldTrump You brought the humanitarian crisis on yourself.  Man up and own it.  Did you visit the children you have locked in cages?  did you visit any of the families?  Somehow every news station missed the "Dangerous Criminals" lurking in the shadows behind you.
@BogdanichRick @SenJackyRosen @SenCortezMasto Trump said on National TV he would be proud to shut the government down.  How can the Democrats suddenly be to blame when in that same sentence he also stated he would not blame the Democrats.
@realDonaldTrump I will ask again and keep asking - did you visit the children you have locked in cages?  Did you visit the families seeking asylum?  or were you simply seeking  photo op?

@stucam7771 How can the Democrats be bi-partisan if McConnell refuses to bring anything they pass to the Senate floor?
@jdickerson The government workers may have already spent for Christmas before they were furloughed.  This would mae the paycheck during the holidays harder to stretch tha ever.  Plus - utilities in many of the state go up higher in the colder weather.
@realDonaldTrump Open the government.  Once that is done and people are back to work, be Bi-Partisan.  and work with them.  ALL of you were elected to serve ALL of the people.
@realDonaldTrump What is wrong with you that you do not understand that a lot of the "Forest Management" is the responsibility of the Federal Government in many of these areas?  How can the "rake the forest" if you cut off their funding?
@CBSNews Campaigning has already started for 2020.  Those of you who are due for re-election might want to consider your options.  Dean Heller of Nevada is an example.  He sucked up to Trump, Trump came to Nevada to support him and . . look how that turned out.

@johnpavlovitz Dialing 0 and hearing "Operator".  3 digit phone numbers, no zip codes, no TV, entertaining ourselves by playing outside once the chores were done . . . that is why many of us live to a ripe old age and are ornery with the spoiled ones of today!
@terril49 @realDonaldTrump I am going to just to see how many times he lies.  I am also anxious to hear the rebuttal on his lies.  I would prefer watching the new NCIS but #PresidentLoco  preempted that.
@terril49 @tonyposnanski Plus we can always hope NCIS will be on CBS if it doesn't drag on to long.  YEP _ I have my priorities on Tuesday night.  He could have jabbered all night Monday night ad I'd just be playing games on the computer.
@tonyposnanski I will sacrifice my time to watch him simply because I want to see the Democrats rebuttal. I'm curious how many lies they will catch!
@DanRather I see a national emergency in the oval office.

@terril49 The popup would start when he opened his mouth and never go back down!
@drdave1999 @susan_basquez the only thing that frightens me is that I  will miss the new NCIS!  I hope the networks turn him down - he can talk to his choir on Fox.

@ABC I have worked all my life and not one single time have I heard someone say it is Ok if you don't pay me.  He has no clue.  He has never been in the position he has put thousands of people in at the coldest most costly time of the year.
@RepSwalwell Thanks for the laugh.  I guess it depends on which side of the wall you are on if you are locked in, or locked out.   we are a land of immigrants and Individual 1 tends to forget that.

@realDonaldTrump Have  you considered that holding thousands of workers hostage is not the best way to get the wall?  It isn't the wall - it is the shut down that pisses us off!
@DearAuntCrabby @realDonaldTrump How can it be a strike if he ordered the shut down?  The workers did not voluntarily walk out - they were TOLD to stay home and others were TOLD to work without pay.
@realDonaldTrump Open the government, then fight out the rest of it.  You had a Republican Senate and House for 2 years and accomplished nothing.  Act like a President and put these people back to work!
@HoarseWisperer Now and then again later.
@ananavarro I prefer President Loco or Individual 1 when speaking of him.
@GovSandoval I am grateful for all you have done for the State in the past 8 years.  Thank You.  You will be missed.
@GlennKesslerWP @terril49 He is talking to the ones in his head.  I can't think of a single president, living or dead who would agree with him.  It is not the voice of a long gone President talking to him.
@CNNSitRoom It is my understanding that "emergency powers" are to be used only in the case of a real emergency.  POTUS promises of a wall do not come under the heading of emergency.  His actions are close if not right there for impeachment.

@terril49 @seungminkim @FaceTheNation I would love to see his Secret Service do a walk out.   I was told by a Government employee yesterday that the "Shut down" is for "non-essential workers like him.  He is Wild Land fire
@BarbaraAnnStein @jdickerson Sunday mornings are fun on both ABC and CBS!    Well fun for me, maybe not for Trump and friends.
@terril49 The County and State where the person lives.  It is an establishment that takes government funding - like our County Hospital, it is written off.  Someone has to pay for it, and often it falls back on the entity that has the least money in the till.
Facts don't matter!  This is a fun one to retweet!  Turn about is fair play - this ones for President Obama! https://t.co/6xQnjiXdaP
@DebAdadj71 @realDonaldTrump turn about is fair play, right?  who needs fact?  Individual 1 sure doesn't so why should we?  Thanks for the giggle.
@lisamurkowski @Interior @SecretaryZinke I fail to see how he has helped any of us in the long run.  Drill o public land, create pollution, deny climate change - all good for the momentary dollar, but look at the damage to future generations!  I'm glad to see  him go!!!
@realDonaldTrump Just when the rest of us are feeling bad for someone, you - the leader of the free world - have to come in with an insult.  What an example you are . . . NOT!
@terril49 @Patbagley I don't care.  Do you?  Sorry - just couldn't resist.   I agree with all you said.
@amvetsupport I think it would be funny if even he turned the job down~  No one wants to deal with that.
@AynRandPaulRyan @debbie61349155 I wonder how many others are near death or have died?   How many will never see their parents or parents see their children again?
@realDonaldTrump I heard you very plainly say that you would be "proud to shut down the government"  - and it was like watching a reality show the way you were acting . . and a bad one at that.
@terril49 None for a little girl from Honduras.  She had came across with her Dad illegally, and had been sent to a camp.  She had not eaten for serval day, was dehydrated.  When they realized how bad she was they did try to save her but . .
@krassenstein Individual 1 will do anything to deflect from what is really happening.  Meanwhile, he is making the life of good people miserable simply because they are Vietnamese.	I do not believe he can legally do this but . . the key word is legal and that often is lost.

@CraigRozniecki This sounds like a lot better deal than we have in office right now.  I've tried and tried and can't see any thing wrong with those just elected.  Maybe take your head out of your butt ad you could see plainly?
@realDonaldTrump BREAKING NEWS~  You campaign promise was that MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR THE WALL.  	Have you forgotten that?
@MoLulkowski I don't mind her expressing her view but I do wish she would stop interrupting others when they are expressing theirs.  Meghan has a problem with that.
@terril49 @HoarseWisperer True - same goes for Individual 1.
@RanttMedia @realDonaldTrump Has anyone told Individual 1 that the employee's who are guarding the  border will not be paid?  If I remember correctly - MEXICO WOULD PAY FOR THE WALL!
@wvjoe911 Meghan, I respect your views and your right to speak them but . . could you please let others finish speaking before you reply?  I respect Kelly, but he was not right for the job and I'm sorry he ever accepted it.
@Ironhorse76 It is hard to get all you want out, and still use proper punctuation.  Sometimes that comma or period just has to fall by the wayside.  we are limited to the amount of characters.
@wvjoe911 . . . and it's crying time again - they're gonna leave you . . and Big Bad Democrats will be mean to you and justice will be served.  Bye Donald - it ain't been good to know ya'.
@krassenstein Time to go home Orin!  You are losing it!  Go back and check on what you said about Clinton then apologize for these latest remarks.
@Evan_McMullin Dean Heller from Nevada is a good example of what happens to good men when they forget that they represent the State they were elected in not the President.
@krassenstein Good for him!  Just maybe he realizes all that Planned Parenthood entails.  I believe he is an honest man and has paid for his sins in the past.  I may be wrong but I doubt POTUS can count on him to acquit!
@terril49 Republican's need to be reminded of this.  Lying to the nation, trying to cover it up should not make a difference in what party you claim to be in.

@TomthunkitsMind This man is a racist idiot!  He wasn't sure if he wanted to insult her for speaking Spanish to her Mom, or for being from Ohio.  wish I would have had my lily white old self in that parking lot - he would have got an earful!
@realDonaldTrump The country is divided.  Racism has came out of the dark and into our streets,  The stock market is in free fall.  Children are locked in pens with out their parents.  I could go on and on - and you are "having a great time"? I'm not!

@Nativeesoul Aho!  I support our rights.
@HoarseWisperer My children are my best friends and I talked to my oldest for hours this morning although we are in different states.
@TheView @terril49 @RepMiaLove You had a darned close race, and you lost in a Republican state. WHY?  Not because you are female. Not because of your race or gender but because you thought you were so far above the people in you state that you did not campaign on a personal basis.  All you did was negative ads

@realDonaldTrump I sincerely hope you listened carefully and learned from the beautiful ceremony.  George H.W. Bush was a kind and gentle man - not a bully.  He did not bash Democrats.  He worked across the aisle.  I pray you paid attention.
@jdickerson This is the days saddest news  HOW can anyone eat just 6 French fries unless they mean 6 at once until the plate is empty?
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I would be happy to give you to them if that is what they want.  I used to be middle class, but that has changed drastically under your leadership.
we can't forget about these children.  Trump keeps trying to side track us from thinking about this tragedy.  I will never forget or forgive what he has done to these families and the life long damage to the children. https://t.co/1CZFEP7c8B
@realDonaldTrump I heard you say over and over that MEXICO was going to pay for the wall.  Now you are telling us we have to pay for it?  You have to be kidding, right?  wrong?
@terril49 @jonesnews I agree 100%.  My prayer is that both the Republicans and the Democrats have good enough candidates that we do not have to suffer through another term of @realDonaldTrump
@joe_thoma_iv @mattizcoop I think Carter will get the same treatment.  He has done so much for all humanity after he was President.  His life after politic's shold guarantee that.
@terril49 @HoarseWisperer I hope your 120th is this month as I'm a 177 years old and that beef is bad for me.  :-)

@stucam7771 You expressed my sentiments exactly.  Religion, sexual orientation, race should not matter.  I so agree - Live and Let Live!
@realDonaldTrump what the REAL NEWS is reporting is the death of 3 American soldiers.  Sometimes it is not all about you!

@terril49 @riotwomennn I believe him.  I haven't always agreed with him, but in this case I do.  I believe he really feels it.
@realDonaldTrump How much air pollution and global warming will this cause?  It won't create a lot of jobs as things are getting more and more automated.  if you can't read, please have someone read to you and explain the facts.
@terril49 Dirty rotten bastard.  How I hate @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump @GM Have you thought that you are a lot to blame for this with the tariffs you imposed on steal?
@terril49 @JimDabakis Nevada and Utah got rid of two suck ups - Heller and Love. Hatch has retired, so things are looking up!
@mmpadellan Pelosi would be a Hell of a lot better than what we have now with Trump and Pence!  Help us get back on track, then bow out for a younger person in 2020.
@JeffFlake @ChrisCoons Hopefully, some of the GOP see what happened in the House and realize they need to protect Mueller.  Trump is sounding like a very guilty scared person right now.
@stucam7771 I believe there are safe guards in place so that no one person can "push a button" and destroy the world.  He is doing more damage with his Tweets and his statements that we all need to worry about.
@terril49 I believe they are asking immigrants to come in through the border crossings to ask for asylum rather than crossing without the US knowing they are here.  My grandfather came through Ellis island - others enter legally though a Port of Entry.
@Trump @DonaldJTrumpJr @TrumpStore ????????  I thought POTUS was not supposed to be running a private business while holding office.  Here he is - promoting it!  Don't laws pertain to him too????
@stucam7771 I'm a great grandma, not a lawyer, but . . I think it could be considered an act of war.  Scares the Hell out of me!

@krassenstein Someone sure has something on Graham - he is not the person who was McCain's friend.  He is turning into Trump.
@terril49 That report was rushed out on Black Friday by the Federal Government - I'm sure in hopes that everyone was too busy to hear or care.  Scary!!!

@realDonaldTrump why do you call them African American's?  They are American just like you or I!  Oh - and - Democrats do not lock children in cages away from parents or other family members.
@DFranklinChi I am a Republican who initially supported Kavanaugh.  Dr. Ford's testimony was so honest and heart rending.  when the he began to speak I realized that he could not be unbiased - his comments at the start proved that.
@OMGno2trump There is also the fact that he started off making it political!
@terril49 Me too! https://t.co/Ax6fN575PQ
@jdickerson She was nervous as anyone would be who was not used to that type of public scrutiny.  A brave woman, who overcame her fears to testify as what she felt was her "civic duty."  I admire her and thank her for her bravery.
@terril49 He does not have the temperate manner required in a Supreme Court Judge.  His emotion, his cutting off Senators questioning him, insulting a female Senaator . . .
@TwitterMoments Graham over does on the Kool Aide.  I was waiting for the men in White Jackets to carry him away!
@DonaldJTrumpJr I believe that Kavanaugh proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that he is too emotionally untastable, and be too belligerent to even be considered as a Supreme Court

@terril49 @senorrinhatch This is the same Senator who insisted Anita Hill be vetted by the FBI - now he says it can not be done.  He will be remembered for his anti-feminist talks.
@EdKrassen Here is another idea for the brilliant Senators - Dr. Ford asked for an FBI investigation - that should give them a slight clue that she is telling the truth!
@wvjoe911 Evil enough to take children from their parents and lock them in cages? Evil enough to insult any one who doesn't bow down to him?  Need more?  I got it!
@realDonaldTrump What has happened to the 16 women who filed charges against you?  Did you pay them off?  Threaten them?  Have you ever been on the receiving end, or just been the perpetrator?  You have no right to judge!!!
@DanRather I sincerely hope the women of Nevada make him eat that remark during the November election.
@SenatorCollins Do you really thing a group of old white men will teat her fairly?  She has asked for an FBI Investigation - what are you all afraid they will find?  Guilt on Kavanaugh's part?
