.@united My name is Mr. Griffith
.@united It's not a feeling, it's a reality. What changed? Nothing. I'm still here, dog tired, with a shitload of excuses. #blahblahblahblah
.@united It's the same all over everyone. Social media customer service is inept to help, and without authority to solve service complaints.
.@united Well, as expected, the answer was useless. Excuses and deniability. Still, I'm 8 hours late, and exhausted.Thanks for nothing #fail
.@united Your solution is to tell me WHY I'm late? ~SMH

.@united I could have left sooner but the line was so long I lost my window. I'm tired, frustrated and angry; and out lots of revenue today!
.@united For what little good it did. They were all defensive and directed everyone to a long line at 'customer service'.
.@united I still have to wait her for another 2 hours. I've been up since 3am CST and missed 2 meetings and 8 hours work. It's killing me!
.@united I booked ORD-&gt;DEN-&gt;GEG. I had to change to a flight leaving 4 hours later with a 5 hour layover in Denver; where I am now.

@chanc3it You‚Äôre welcome. No one is nominated until 1 has the right number of delegates.
@ecolson64 I recognize hate I don‚Äôt share it, and I sure won‚Äôt vote to put it into power. Never raise my right arm and swear an oath to obey
@chanc3it In a split convention it's a vote. All of the delegates awarded the candidates that have withdrawn are free to vote as they chose.
@ecolson64 I'm not thinking what he's saying. He would destroy the economy and bring us into war. He's a lunatic narcissistic psychopath.
@ecolson64 unless you want a dictator vote otherwise. 39% is not a majority. Until now too many cooks. Trump is no president &amp; never will be
@AllenWest @chanc3it It won't matter if no one has enough delegates. A split convention will bring it to a vote. Or two. Or three.
@ecolson64 the entire list is only about 6,000,000 hits in Google search. The man is a menace.
