@brhodes Ben Rhodes, what do you think of the idea (#Israeli Embassy floating this) that achievable goal is wiping out sunset dates, make the restrictions permanent; maybe toughen inspection regime because the #Mossad acquisition does show history of lies + possible #Iran plan to resume?
How do the #Israeli spies of #Mossad act so brazenly inside #Iran?  A lot of info on that in book I wrote with award-winning @Yossi_Melman: Spies Against Armageddon (history of Israeli security/espionage): https://t.co/bF2GNpjkr4

It was weird -- seeing an #Israeli PM on stage showing parts of #Mossad-purloined intelligence.  Strange day that fueled the #Iran #nuclear controversies, did not settle them.  Mossad famous for doing SECRET stuff, I said in @i24NEWS_EN TV excerpt: https://t.co/EV3XDtsAud
@barbaraslavin1 I feel confident the archive is not bogus.  How it was obtained: just a cover story.  Not to admit there are #Iranians paid are blackmailed into delivering info.  Not to admit there are safe houses for #Israeli spies.  Sigh, it is very hard to be sure: truth wrapped in deception?
I would hate to think there was a brave #Mossad team of burglars in #Tehran risking their lives so they could prove #Iran lied about their pre-2015 #nuclear program.  I bet they found a ton more: a big archive.  Huge truck drove it across a border "that same night"?  I doubt it.
On Stateside (anchored by @DavidShuster weeknights at 9pm on @i24NEWS_EN) I noted White House statement went beyond #Netanyahu, said #Iran "has" a robust #arms program.  Oh my, almost silently WhHouse changed that to Iran "had" an arms program.  A serious charge thus shrunk.

Seeing the TV footage of #Syrian troops in #Douma makes me think that the #chemical attack was worth it for #Assad - and (to him) worth absorbing an attack by the Western powers - because it led to an important victory (for him) in Eastern Ghouta near his capital. https://t.co/ImzbhUzrod

Bottom line, from the head of the esteemed @WashInstitute for Near East Policy: U.S. could have struck #Syria anytime.  But without a strategy, i.e. what does USA want as civil war outcome?  (Note #Israel is cautious about Syrian defenses but still acts.) https://t.co/7eZgdjLJZz
A little bit hard to find on the Web, but the White House did (Friday) put out a 5-page "Assessment of the Assad Regime's Chemical Weapons Use."   #Syria #ChemicalWeapons #Pentagon  .This does constitute evidence: https://t.co/oSRTTWbGX8

It is not like #Trump was speaking off-the-cuff as he made his rather formal 8-minute speech announcing the attack on #Syria.  He gave the impression it isn't only 1 event.  Let us add "if necessary" more strikes will occur.  An @i24NEWS excerpt. https://t.co/uCdvezaqlS

@Ostrov_A @SarahKSilverman Not knowing Silverman's full reasoning, I do have the impression she likes + cares about #Israel so perhaps she thinks it is smarter, more humane to let the teenage protester out of jail? Defuse the global furor?  Just askin'.
My mission was to explain, in just 2 fast minutes, the indictment of 13 #Russians for meddling in the U.S. presidential #election. Aired on @i24NEWS_EN (reliable global news, great variety, not stuck on just one story).    https://t.co/aVhx9Q0fKT
On @i24NEWS_EN anchor @DavidShuster quizzed correspondent @DanRaviv on #FBI mistake, plea offer by #schoolShooting killer, #Trumps visit to hospital + cops. (3 minutes): https://t.co/hSEMIFWg3Z
#Trump responds to the indictments of 13 #Russians + 3 Russian (government-backed) entities for meddling.  POTUS does not deny Russia did it. Claims it wasn't aimed to help Trump. (In 2016 it was). No #collusion proved, at this point.  Also an angle for #Mueller: hacking into DNC https://t.co/m7rO03e3SU
.@StuPolitics perhaps fairer to accept initial + basic #Russian goal was 2cause disruption + confusion. But as 2016 went on, best way was to help #Trump win? (Self-advertised "disruptor.")  Do you sniff hints of witting collusion by Trumpists?  Not in today's document. More2come? https://t.co/TxHRrDMp3X
It will be fascinating to see what, if anything, @POTUS says to clarify if #Russia meddling is a "hoax," or has he really meant "collusion" is #fakeNews thus he will say he was always right. #indictments
On @i24NEWS_EN (cable TV on @Optimum 102 and @Spectrum 210 + others) we continue to focus on global news, but #FBI not acting on specific tip re shooter -- and now blockbuster #indictments of #Russians in our news menu, too!  Try the @i24NEWS app, hit LIVE.
About the #AR15 semiautomatic rifle, @RonKlain writes (but conservatives say the ban had no effect on gun deaths!?) : "This weapon was illegal in USA between 1994-2004.  Uses of it in mass shootings declined.  And America was still a free nation...renew the Assault Weapon Ban..."
#Parkland school massacre site is 40 miles from Mar-a-Lago, where @POTUS and @FLOTUS will spend weekend. A date for him/them to visit Parkland hasn't been set. Will NOT be Friday.

Analyzing the Repubs/FBI #Memo on @i24NEWS_EN TV I hazarded a guess: #Trump may well "get away with it," even if he fires #Rosenstein, because unlike 1973 this is a "slow-motion Saturday Night Massacre," gradually undermining the investigations.

@marwanbishara the possibility has been raised in a @CBSRadioNews report. Still uncertain, of course.
@lisang I was curious to know where he was heading w- "If I don't win -- I shouldn't say this, but--". Interrupted himself.
For some reason @realDonaldTrump always says "judges" not justices. But emphasizes SCOTUS reason for all conservatives to back him.
