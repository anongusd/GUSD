And finally, there is no way to describe the kind of rank hypocrisy it takes for the @ncgop to have fanned the phony flames of voter fraud to declare that Harris should be certified even if election fraud occurred. It's disgraceful. @jimmorrill @TimBoyumTV @murphydc @AmyEGardner
And if possible legally, Harris should not be allowed to run again. His campaign committed ACTUAL ELECTION FRAUD twice already, it would be a miscarriage of justice for the remedy to be that he gets to try it a third time.
And as it relates to NC-09, no board of election or U.S. House should ever certify Harris as the winner. His campaign committed ELECTION FRAUD. He can't be certified, should be investigated and prosecuted if appropriate and a new election should be held starting in the primary.
So this is @ncgop @gop in 2018: 		Elect a @POTUS to divide the U.S. along racial and ethic lines.	Fan the flames of race/ethnicity to get #MAGA voters to the polls.	Adopt policies to suppress black votes.	If that doesn't work, commit ACTUAL ELECTION FRAUD	Rinse and Repeat
The @gop has used this BS re: non-existent in person voter fraud to justify racist voter ID laws, to curb early voting and to purge voters from the rolls  and they've done all this while committing ACTUAL ELECTION FRAUD.
And all of this @ncgop and @gop writ large BS about non-existent in person voter fraud has been designed to do one thing: disenfranchise Democratic voters and almost exclusively within that African American voters...with "surgical precision."
But that's not the worst of it. All this @ncgop voter suppression, targeting black voters for disenfranchisement with surgical precision, and committing ACTUAL  ELECTION FRAUD comes after years @gop bullshit about non-existent in person voter fraud.
If you're hellbent on denying early voting on Sunday's because "souls to the polls" is an effective get out the vote program for the African American community as the @NCGOP did in 2016, then stuffing the ballot box with fraudulent absentee ballots to win isn't much of a stretch.
If your willing to impose a voter ID law, as the @NCGOP did, that was struck down by the courts as racist and targeting African Americans with "surgical precision" it's not such a big leap to collect and commit fraud with the ballots of black voters in an election.
The Republican Party is rotten. They can't win without cheating or suppressing votes.  And nowhere is this more evident than North Carolina &amp; the scandal in NC-09 is just the logical outgrowth of blatant efforts to suppress/deny votes of the other side.    https://t.co/kLp9Fcb9cP

Of course there is a long way between now and next Tuesday. @democrats should ignore polls, forecasts, predictions and the bait being thrown out by @realdonaldtrump and focus on turning out the vote for every Democrat in every race everywhere in the country./14
And @realdonaldtrump abandonment of House @GOP is coming just as the @NRCC is scrambling to shore up candidates on their side who should otherwise be safe - with a House map that @natesilver538 says includes 99 (!!!) competitive districts most of which are held by @GOP./13
Just look at his travel schedule. @realdonaldtrump has abandoned campaigning for @NRCC candidates (outside of cookie cutter &amp; sometimes erroneous tweets) and instead is focused almost exclusively on the Senate this coming week (twice to MO, IN and FL, once each to WV and MT)./12
And @realdonaldtrump must see the writing on the wall, that the House majority is likely gone as his job approval tanks, as @democrats are outraising, outspending and out organizing @GOP and as his soft supporters, especially suburban women and independents, flee./11
But in the end, this is about who controls the House. No matter the outcome elsewhere, if @democrats win the House it will represent a full-scale repudiation of @realdonaldtrump, Trumpism and his @GOP enablers in Congress./10
And there are Senate Dem. candidates who will likely win in some very red states running on HEALTH CARE.  And of course there are barrier breaking @democrats running for Gov. across the country with @AndrewGillum and @StaceyAbrams running strong in FL and GA respectively./9
There are interesting subplots that would send a message beyond the House. @democrats will likely sweep the Big Ten Senate races (MI, WI, PA and OH), states which were/are critical to @realdonaldtrump in ‚Äò16 and '20 &amp; we will win some and maybe all of those Gov. races as well./8
And the outcome for control of the House is most reflective of the national mood as opposed to a Senate map titled decidedly in favor of @GOP. Now, count me as still enthusiastic about our Senate prospects, but the story of this election will be about who wins the House./7
It‚Äôs not perfect. Many House districts are gerrymandered for @GOP &amp; @GOP members enjoy the advantage of incumbency against @democrats challengers. But, in putting the brakes on @POTUS @GOP, @democrats winning the House was seen and today is the most achievable path./6
The first step in doing so is putting a check on @realdonaldtrump @GOP.  And, since @realdonaldtrump began his presidency by targeting the ACA, everyone recognized that the surest way for voters to put a check on @POTUS @GOP is to elect a Democratic majority in the House./5
But make no mistake, and @democrats get this because we‚Äôve been on the other side, ultimately this election is a referendum on @POTUS and the @GOP  in Congress ‚Äì their record, governance, priorities ‚Äì and whether voters want to continue in that direction or chart a new course./4
Or, will voters put a check on that agenda by electing @democrats who are running to protect health care, lower drug costs, rebuild infrastructure, make college affordable, provide paid family and medical leave, make the rich pay more in taxes and raise wages./3
The choice voters face is whether or not they want to allow @realdonaldtrump and @GOP to continue their assault on health care, their pilfering of the American treasury for tax breaks for the rich and their anti-women, anti-immigrant, anti-LGBTQ, anti-minority agenda./2
Thread&gt;&gt; A week out, it‚Äôs a good time to reflect on what this election is about broadly politically.  This midterm is no different than most ‚Äì voters are being asked to judge the performance of the party in power in the White House ‚Äì i.e., the President. /1
