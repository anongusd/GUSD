Today I voted to protect generations of Louisianians and Americans by supporting our brave men and women in uniform. #NDAA
Proud to share that I successfully passed #NDAA amendment helping #smallbiz recover, rebuild, thrive after natural disasters.
Included in #NDAA: amendment authorizing $10M for NOLA Air National Guard to make much-needed facility updates, upgrades.
Big win for Louisiana safety - I passed legislation to support La. National Guard training so we will be better protected in the future.
Today, I led Congress in reaffirming our commitment to modernize the nuclear TRIAD, which will help Barksdale &amp; Global Strike Command in La.
It's time to update Barksdale's B-52 fleet. I made sure the #NDAA included language to do just that. #AirForce
Included in #NDAA: amendment restoring significant, dignified work for Americans w/ disabilities stolen by bad Obama policies.
I made sure #NDAA included language to protect Louisiana's troop levels, retaining Brigade Combat Team at @FortPolkPAO.
