@JLNielsonPhD @KazJNelson Absolutely! I‚Äôve worked to encourage others to do the same. Anecdotally, I‚Äôve run into a number of interns who felt they don‚Äôt have time to vote with their demanding schedules. Something simple like a lunch with computers to register/ sign up for absentee ballots would be great!
@dradahmed Couldn‚Äôt agree more. A few classmates of mine worked to ensure residents, fellows, and med students would have dedicated time at @RegionsHospital noon conference to register to vote/ obtain absentee ballot.
Concerned about healthcare? 1) Vote for ppl who represent your values 2) Utilize preventative medicine - vaccines (flu, HPV etc), annual exams 3) Practice safe sex, use condoms 4) Spoiler: we all die. Talk w/ your provider about end of life care. #VoteForHealthcare

As I finish my time in psychiatry with a number of patients with substance use disorders, I am reminded of how important people like @Randerson041 from @RummlerHOPE are in reducing the harm in these patients lives. Keep it up! #OverdoseAwarenessDay https://t.co/lHZENEYUsA
Absolutely! https://t.co/CJzChJBPSn
Shocked, saddened, and disappointed to hear this about ‚Å¶@DrFrieden‚Å©, someone I held in such high regard for his dedication to public health. I remember how excited I was that he spoke at my graduation from ‚Å¶‚Å¶@JohnsHopkinsSPH‚Å©  https://t.co/cVbyMm8Dls
@jburcum He spoke at my graduation at Johns Hopkins SPH - my jaw dropped seeing this! I‚Äôve looked up to him for his dedication to public health over his career...

@rheault_m Good to know!
@rheault_m Good for you! I can only imagine how challenging those times must have been. Glad to see you found your way back to research!
@DrQuinnCapers4 Keep it up! Not only are you improving medicine through patient care but also by recruiting future doctors, especially ones of color! We need more Docs like you, encouraging people to go for it!
Can we take a mental health day from @umnmedschool intersession to attend? üòâ wish I could be there! Glad to see this is happening!!! https://t.co/KG3Yy46OkX

@DavidJuurlink That‚Äôd be the day! The cherry on top would be if we could combine it with other potions to prevent rubella, mumps, and maybe even chicken pox...
Working with patients who have attempted suicide can be challenging yet so rewarding. Having had a good friend loose his battle with depression only months ago, I‚Äôve found meaning in helping patients avoid the same result. #MentalHealth #YouHaveValue #MedStudent #medtwitter

@OBGaYN It will be interesting to see over the course of the next 10 years or so how students at NYU match. Will this     tuition free med ed be sufficient to increase students pursuit of primary care careers? Valid criticisms of this plan though. It‚Äôs a great start.

@MDinPink What rotation are you on? Has it been particularly challenging as of late or simply its added up to a threshold?
@KazJNelson in one tweet, what advice would you give to @umnmedschool students so they can be a valued member of the healthcare team in their psychiatry rotation? #Rotations #MedStudent
@EMDocEllie @choo_ek Thanks for sharing this, it means a lot! A close friend and classmate of mine in med school took his life 2 months ago. I want to do whatever I can to help my colleagues to prevent this. Sharing experiences is a part of that process. Thank you so much for your openness!

@pissedoffpremed Agreed. As a current medical student I want to genuinely learn as much as I can in each rotation, even ones I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll go into. Each of them offer tools/tips that you can utilize to be a better provider...

@dradahmed @umnmedschool @800273TALK @NAMIMinnesota Very much appreciated. It‚Äôs challenging to lose a close friend and classmate to suicide 2 months ago the have a recent grad only 1 month into residency take his life. It‚Äôs a wake up call to all of us as med students we need balance
@clinkshrink @umnmedschool @800273TALK @NAMIMinnesota Much appreciated. We lost a classmate 2 months ago and got news that a recent grad took his life 1 month into residency... it‚Äôs hard. We want to help our patients yet we find those we are closest too may need it just as much.
