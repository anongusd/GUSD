.@SecretaryPerry is focused on future of #USA energy security. @FERC must act to address the distortions that have threatened resiliency.
@ENERGY @SecretaryPerry @POTUS .@POTUS &amp; @SecretaryPerry will do more than pay lip service to an All of the Above approach energy policy. Fuel Diversity = Energy Security
Enough talk, @ENERGY will take bold, merit-based action ensuring #USA's long-term energy security under @SecretaryPerry &amp; @POTUS
Fuel diversity is Fuel Security. When ALL sectors contribute to generation mix, grid is stronger, more reliable, more resistant to outages.
Section 403 authority is clear &amp; unambiguous- Also has been used previously to correct energy imbalances
.@SecretaryPerry NOPR to @FERC is not a prop up of nuclear and coal but a leveling of energy generation playing field to value resiliency

Chu: Going forward, renewable technologies will be as cheap as fossile. There is a growing world market. We'd rather be exporting that tech.
Chu to Issa: prior to this administration, no action on loans in either 1703 or 1705.
Loan program dried up capital for renewable? To the contrary: program helped spur private sector investments in solar. http://t.co/btbUZzIP
