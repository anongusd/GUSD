@alwaysaliberal @G00D4BBS @RadioFreeTom She‚Äôs an economic populist. I think it is dangerous to pit Wall Street vs Main Street‚Äîwhatever those two terms are supposed to mean like they don‚Äôt overlap significantly. I think Democrats, overall, are pro business, pro trade, and capitalist, but also pro social justice.
@gluonspring @RadioFreeTom My state has a caucus that was overrun by Bros in 2016 (we have a primary that doesn‚Äôt award delegates too). I support changing to just a primary that awards delegates, but we don‚Äôt track party affiliation as far as I know.
@TheRickWilson I‚Äôd be fine if Warren left the party and  even political life. Please don‚Äôt define us by the vocal fringe.
@G00D4BBS @RadioFreeTom I want the Democrats to be more forceful and vocal in distancing themselves from the likes of Bernie, Warren, and especially Antifa. 		In many case they should be publicly condemned by Democratic leadership.
@G00D4BBS @RadioFreeTom Yes, and I‚Äôm aware and I point that out all the time, especially when articles about Dems use his stupid face. 		But that doesn‚Äôt change the fact of the association. People think the Democrats are defined by the leftmost no matter how tenuous the association.
@RadioFreeTom Bernie Sanders make me uneasy about Democrats. Hopefully we can make him irrelevant.
