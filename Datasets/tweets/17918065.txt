For those that think politics don't matter, think again. For those that have become disillusioned with politics, re-engage. You have a voice -- these children do not and they pay the price when you do not speak up and when you do not vote.		#whywemarch #IVoteProLife‚úÖ		[10/10]
And just last week, House Democrats rallied with the new president of Planned Parenthood to kick off efforts to repeal the Hyde Amendment to force everyone to pay for abortions. That law alone has saved over 2 million lives.		[9/10]
There is a federal version of this legislation that would wipe out ALL pro-life laws off the books across the country. Every state would look like New York does now. It has a huge number of co-sponsors. 		[8/10]
Elections have consequences. This is the agenda of the modern-day Democratic Party. Long gone are the days of "SAFE, legal, and RARE." More African American babies in New York City are aborted than carried to term -- and that was before this law was passed.		[7/10]
This past November, Democrats took over the State Senate and have their biggest majority since the early 1900s, paving the way for this legislation to be passed.		[6/10]
Think this doesn't happen? Google Kermit Gosnell or my friends Melissa @melissaohden and @JillStanek.		Here's how this happened: For years, the Republican State Senate blocked this legislation. 		[5/10]
3Ô∏è‚É£Removes protections for children born alive after failed abortions. These children will no longer be protected -- instead the tiny boy or girl will be left at the mercy of the abortionist who just minutes earlier was trying to kill him or her.		[4/10]
2Ô∏è‚É£Allows non-doctors to perform abortions. The law could also result in forcing health professionals to participate in abortions even if they object.		[3/10]
1Ô∏è‚É£Allows for abortions up until the moment of birth. Prior to the new law, abortions were allowed up until 24 weeks. That restriction is gone.		[2/10]

For years, pro-abortion organizations have used U.S. taxpayer funds to weaken, undermine or reverse #ProLife laws in other nations, and destroy the precious lives of these children - @RepChrisSmith

There is absolutely no moral or ethical justification for treating unborn children and their organs like commodities. We urge President Trump to direct his agencies to put policies in place that truly reflect the values of pro-life Americans.
Let's be very clear about this: #ProLife voters do not want to foot the bill for ANY research that involves harvesting the body parts of unborn children from induced abortion. That's NEVER OK.
This is the second time that senior NIH officials have jumped ahead of the Administration‚Äôs ongoing audit process ‚Äì both times reaching conclusions that are out of step with the President‚Äôs pro-life agenda.
Reports that NIH officials insist the agency will continue taxpayer funding for unethical fetal tissue research are deeply disturbing to the millions of pro-life Americans who embrace the sanctity of every human life and who elected President Trump - @marjoriesba

Thank you @RepMarkWalker for joining almost 200 of your colleagues and signing on to the letter calling on the Trump Admin to issue the #ProtectLife rule!! https://t.co/zIKL7fKIHb
‚è© Fast-forward to today - the Trump Admin is proposing to reinstate the Reagan-era regs - MINUS the specific ‚Äúgag rule‚Äù component‚Äîthat is, the prohibition on counseling for abortion in Title X clinics.		i.e., this is clearly not a "gag rule." [8/8]		#ProtectLife #NoGagRule
but in @BillClinton's first week in office, he threw out the regs. [7/8]
The Reagan Admin ultimately responded to the report in 1988 with a set of regulations that prohibited Title X clinics from ‚Äúco-locating‚Äù with abortion clinics in a single facility -- these regs were UPHELD by the Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision [6/8]
In the late 1980s, @USGAO issued a report about the Title X program that noted clinics seemed routinely to blur the lines between Title X services and abortion‚Äîoften essentially referring patients to on-site abortions. The report recommended HHS establish clearer barriers [5/8]
...this supports abortion not only because money is fungible within an organization but also because abortion clinics and Title X clinics are often located in the same facility, and the latter appear routinely to just provide referrals to the former. [4/8]
Planned Parenthood (the nation‚Äôs largest abortion provider by far) receives about 20% of all Title X funds each year... [3/8]
"The statute... was written to specifically prohibit taxpayer support for abortion as a method of family planning, but it has been clear for decades that the boundary between Title X clinics and abortion clinics is often very porous." [2/8]

"A life with Down syndrome is a life worth living, and a life worth defending. I stand with my brothers and sisters with #Downsyndrome and ask you to reconsider your beliefs and the dangerous effect your words may have on vulnerable children in the United States and beyond."
5Ô∏è‚É£ You devalue the lives of those living with #Downsyndrome when you imply that in order for a child to be desired, they must be highly intelligent, have unlimited life choices and good health, and the ability to eventually live independently and become financially secure.
4Ô∏è‚É£ The purpose of prenatal testing is ùëõùëúùë° to decide whether to kill a baby. The purpose of prenatal testing is to provide ùëèùëíùë°ùë°ùëíùëü ùëêùëéùëüùëí for the patient - not to decide whether the patient's life has worth!!
3Ô∏è‚É£ You appeal to morality, but there is nothing moral about your position. Your article gives a nod to ‚Äúdifficult moral choices‚Äù, but then resolves the moral considerations on the basis of ‚Äòeveryone does it.‚Äô
2Ô∏è‚É£ There is NO Constitutional right to abort an unborn child with Down syndrome. In fact, the Supreme Court has ùëõùëíùë£ùëíùëü recognized a right to abort an unborn child because of his or her genetic abnormality or disability.
1Ô∏è‚É£ Eugenics is ùëéùëôùë§ùëéùë¶ùë† wrong. As a feminist, how do you reconcile tacit support for the underlying principle of eugenics that has resulted in the death of so many female children? ü§î
