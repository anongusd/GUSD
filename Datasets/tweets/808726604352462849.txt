@realDonaldTrump Come on, man, this isn't what Presidents do.		Real Presidents lead.		They don't whine on twitter.		Real Presidents hold press conferences and answer questions.		They don run away from reporters like your cowardly ass does.		Real Presidents aren't anywhere near as stupid as you.
@SRuhle Maybe!

@Carver926 @realDonaldTrump You support Trump, per your bio.		And, you question the intelligence of others, me in particular, reasoning that those who are not President are not "really that smart."		You are not President.		Employing your reasoning, it follows that you aren't "really that smart."		Brilliant.
