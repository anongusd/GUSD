@ABCPolitics @GStephanopoulos You’re just concerned about your own ties to this mess and the Russian money via the NRA.
@NRATV @MomsDemand @stinchfield1776 Yes mothers wanting their kids to come home from school are the extremists.  Not the group spending billions trying to thwart any effort even for universal background checks. #NRATerror #NraRussianasset
@faryl @KAMALAMODE @bwwik @BernieSanders Yes he has denied racism is a problem long enough. He has asserted its simply a by product of income inequality long enough. He has had too many ties to Soviet Russia long enough. He’s avoided showing his own taxes long enough. He’s done quite enough, I agree.
@KAMALAMODE @windmillcharger @BernieSanders Because he doesn’t think racism exists outside of income inequality. He’s a racist, it’s simple.
@bjcreigh @Jayge26 I’m not sure it’s luck but rather “pickled”. I have had the enormous “pleasure” of working a show for her on lighting and sound. She is bat shit crazy, total junkie and so is her brother.

@tonyschwartz @KL04655767 Technically this is a nothing burger. He did not use he official @POTUS account. Ethically however it’s a huge problem but still nothing in comparison. Maybe the federal prosecutors in DC can file another emoluments case but I doubt it.
@Kamalaallday @ManMet80 All of your excellent points aside, Sanders is a racist. He thinks racism isn’t really a “thing” just the result of income inequality. No one can be that stupid to think having money saves you from racism or causes it. He is just plain racist.

@DonaldJTrumpJr So even traitor tot jr has the narcissistic sociopathic habit of referring to himself in third person, perfect. Another arrogant idiot
@GOP @VP Actually it was policies based on social democracy that did that. Progressive tax rates did that. Corporations paying 30% tax did that. Supply side economics can not work in a consumer driven economy. It’s basic math so I know it’s hard for you, ask mother to explain it
@andersonb123 @DonaldJTrumpJr If your rate dropped you make over 250,000 or your lying
@Elaine69178163 @RepRichHudson @CPAC Yes laws get broken but we still have them and they still work the majority of the time. The logic from you seems to be “why have laws, people will break them”. Just stupid
@Elaine69178163 @RepRichHudson @CPAC No you never claimed to be an expert you just arrogantly assert what you know to be good or bad, right and wrong, true and false. That’s all.
@andersonb123 @DonaldJTrumpJr Why does a company that makes billions in profit need tax payer subsidies?
@andersonb123 @DonaldJTrumpJr You’re, right, they get subsidies and pay little to no federal tax.
@andersonb123 @DonaldJTrumpJr So you haven’t a clue what a progresssive tax rate is or you have no reading comprehension.
@Elaine69178163 @RepRichHudson @CPAC No I didn’t bring them up for hunting, you tried to deflect by bringing up hunting. I’m saying having lived in Texas I know that doesn’t qualify you as an expert on the use or firearms as you implied. Not does owning them
@Elaine69178163 @RepRichHudson @CPAC All you can do is lie and distract
@Elaine69178163 @RepRichHudson @CPAC Lmao! I spent 22 years living in Texas, I’m from Memphis, and I own here guns. Your word salad about hunting is irrelevant to background checks not being done on all sales, high capacity clips, high velocity armor piercing rounds, or modifications to make them automatic.
@Elaine69178163 @RepRichHudson @CPAC No a gun is also a weapon of war. Many of the assault style weapons are designed and created for maximum damage to a human body, not hunting. Your logic doesn’t exist. Your denial of reality however is overwhelming.
@andersonb123 @DonaldJTrumpJr Leftist logic is simply use my tax dollars for me not to give Amazon a refund.
@andersonb123 @DonaldJTrumpJr Get even? Smh No I want billionaires to pay the same sales tax on their more than 1 million dollar boats as I do buying a car. I want them to pay into Social Security based on all their income not less than 1% of their income. I want my tax dollars to benefit people not corps

@IranLionness @KoushaHashemi @ChuiiLaFolle These kids were “unaccompanied minors” meaning they came here alone. Trumo took kids from their parents. He had no plans for tracking or returning them and now DHS has literally hundreds of kids they have no way to return, no idea who they or their parents are.

@bamdad_azad @ChuiiLaFolle No trumps policies are ignorant, ill informed, and generally racist. The media reporting what he says and does is not bias.
@ChuiiLaFolle @KoushaHashemi He is being treated fairly. How is using his own words and actions to judge him “unfair”? That’s just ridiculous.
@KoushaHashemi @ChuiiLaFolle Yes Obama failed in Syria and it cost way too many lives. If you can’t defend trumo and his policies without deflecting to someone else then you know deep down it’s indefensible
@KoushaHashemi @ChuiiLaFolle That footage is not new wall.  Lmao! It’s repairs not new. It’s also work approved under Obama. POTUS does not give contracts or plan this type of work, congress does. Take a basic civics class and maybe you won’t repeat as many lies?
@KoushaHashemi @ChuiiLaFolle No it was not a policy to take kids from their parents, that’s an abject lie. The Obama administration had a family policy to ensure we kept them together whenever possible.
@ChuiiLaFolle @realDonaldTrump @USAdarFarsi Well supporting racist sexual abuses id sociopathic but not necessarily rude.
@ChuiiLaFolle @realDonaldTrump @USAdarFarsi So you appreciate his racism towards Iranians because you dislike the current religious zealots in charge? You are an id!ot
@ChuiiLaFolle Yes how do you stay so ignorant in a world of instant access to information? It’s truly astounding.
@ChuiiLaFolle Incapable
@realDonaldTrump You mean that thing he said would never happen while building new sites after you gave up joint mi,Italy exercises and training? Right, no one is buying it.
@ChuiiLaFolle He is incalculable if caring about others, it’s a show. You’re an idiot
@ChuiiLaFolle So the US version of hitler stands with you? Lmao! Sweet baby Jesus if you think he wouldn’t ban you from coming here and want to send you prison if you did you’re truly an idiot. He’s interested in Iran because oil and he wants to reverse anything Obama did.
@ChuiiLaFolle When his own DHS says they have kids in cages and it gets reported, he calls it fake. When he lies about building new wall and his own agencies show that’s a lie, he calls the news fake. You’re just too stupid to know how stupid you are. What do you even know about the US?
@ChuiiLaFolle Bullsh!t.
@ChuiiLaFolle Lmao! Yes please tell me when Obama said white nationalists neo nazis were “fine people” or got sued dozens of times for racial discrimination in housing? When did Obama call people racist names? Lmao! Iran’s green movement means nothing here. Dunning Kruger at work
@ddale8 @ElliotMoghul No sorry racism is not “subjective”. It even has an objective definition. Here is a copy of that definition so you never say such a stupid thing again. No Lee was not racist but racism is real. https://t.co/mRW7tzs8AF
@ChuiiLaFolle @sfrantzman @marcorubio Obviously more than you, the person who calls trump a man of your hearts. Lmao!

@ChuiiLaFolle But please, tell us how racist you are that he speaks to your “heart” ROFLMAO!
@ChuiiLaFolle President of hearts? Lmao! He’s a racist pig, he sexually assaults women and freely admits it, he has taken children from their families and locked them in cages. He has no heart, ask any professional. He is a narcissistic sociopath. I say that as a mental health professional.
@cmclymer @meg_Y12 I’m not sure it’s “valid”. This movie was written based on the drivers sons memory of his dad telling him the story. I think people need to look at the story, the truth behind why Green Books existed and let’s deal with that. Way to distract from the point of the movie.

@sheryl_monk @robotsofbk @AviFlyGirl @KissMyGritsGOP @Orionarmstar @ElliotMoghul @jamooreforsc15 @Bugs4US I am not saying this tweet is “bad” or anything about it specifically but generally speaking, I don’t ever want to know what god myth worship as an elected official. It makes me trust your judgment less many times when I do learn, like Pence.
@robotsofbk @MurdockResists @AviFlyGirl @KissMyGritsGOP @Orionarmstar @ElliotMoghul @jamooreforsc15 @Bugs4US Evidence shows religion comes from an attempt to understand nature as well as life and death. That is not evidence any religion or god exists nor that anything supernatural exists. My point however is only that beliefs are not innocuous many times.
@robotsofbk @MurdockResists @AviFlyGirl @KissMyGritsGOP @Orionarmstar @ElliotMoghul @jamooreforsc15 @Bugs4US I think about the fact that there is no good that requires religion or a god to accomplish and the evil it can inspire and I can’t justify religious belief. Not for myself. I don’t suggest thought crime or banishing belief but I will always question it
@robotsofbk @MurdockResists @AviFlyGirl @KissMyGritsGOP @Orionarmstar @ElliotMoghul @jamooreforsc15 @Bugs4US To read any of the three Abrahamic religious texts as written it is a sadistic narcissistic psychopath of a god. If you read just the words like any book.
@robotsofbk @MurdockResists @AviFlyGirl @KissMyGritsGOP @Orionarmstar @ElliotMoghul @jamooreforsc15 @Bugs4US Not most religions today. The secularization is what has saved them. In Deuteronomy god commands you kill an entire town if just one person worships another god. In Luke you’re told to hate your family before god or you can not be a disciple. The Quran also calls for hate.
@robotsofbk @AviFlyGirl @KissMyGritsGOP @Orionarmstar @ElliotMoghul @jamooreforsc15 @Bugs4US Religion poisons everything.
@robotsofbk @AviFlyGirl @KissMyGritsGOP @Orionarmstar @ElliotMoghul @jamooreforsc15 @Bugs4US I know this sounds good in theory but I have to disagree for a few reasons. First beliefs can destroy lives without that person being any kind of official. 13 states allow parents to deny medicine to children due to religious beliefs. Many states allow child marriage, right here
@AviFlyGirl @KissMyGritsGOP @robotsofbk @Orionarmstar @ElliotMoghul @jamooreforsc15 @Bugs4US People with gods do awful things thinking they’re good. God myths really have no place in modern society. We should live according to evidence and reason not belief in claims with no evidence or worse claims evidence has proven false. The Bible myth is one example
@TommyHicksGOP @GOP @realDonaldTrump Because the accomplishments were under Obama, trump has slowed growth and increased income inequality. The debt has exploded and you’re giving tax breaks to the richest among us. Stop lying

@AuthorKimberley @janet_yackle No I think the attacks on her being a “mean boss” are pretty irrelevant from what I’ve read. A man doing that would be called “driven” and a “type A personality” or my favorite “a leader”. From a woman she’s unlikable and mean.

@realKevinNutt @Newsweek 2% of reported crimes are false reports, that means 98% are true. Almost the opposite of your certainty level with zero evidence to support it being false and internal affairs investigation as evidence it is true.
@realKevinNutt @Newsweek Where did I mention race?
@realKevinNutt @Steel94010 @Newsweek There it is, Jussie also is being charged with a felony as people should who file false reports. Internal affairs only investigate cops. Stop being so dishonest
@realKevinNutt @Steel94010 @Newsweek Internal affairs investigation suggests he’s a cop. You can’t be that dumb, you can’t. Your grammar is too good to be that dumb so all that’s left is serious intellectual dishonesty. In plain terms, lying
@realKevinNutt @Newsweek Lmao! There is no reason to question this video especially since the police are investigating one of their own. It’s not an impersonation investigation but internal affairs. Smh. The lengths conservatives will go to in order to deflect from the real problem of police abuse

@Sea_2Lake @johnpavlovitz Actually the simple definition of religion is belief in a god or gods. No rules required just belief. Faith or belief in the absence of evidence is what gives us things like the Klan, ISIS, and anti gay hate, extremism, and terror. It’s not a positive. Luke 14:26 sums it up
@cathyurbanski1 @johnpavlovitz Most of the Bible is absolutely false, that’s just reality. No global flood, no Jonah, no exodus, no talking plants or animals, all myth. Even the census in the birth story of Christ is not true. That emperor never held a census.
@johnpavlovitz @roedio73 I’m gay and that’s the least of the reasons I left the world of “faith”. It was mostly a lack of evidence to confirm and mountains against any god myth, especially of the Bible. Evidence and reason based living and legislation are what’s needed, not more myth.

@SexCounseling @cam14132788 @realDonaldTrump You obviously have not read a single court document in any of these cases. Stone, the most recent, he was working directly with Wikileaks and Russian intelligence officers getting the hacked emails released at certain times to help trump. Like when the “grab them..” came out
@SexCounseling @cam14132788 @realDonaldTrump The president at very best is guilty of obstruction, at worst treason.
@SexCounseling @cam14132788 @realDonaldTrump Reality I not personal or opinion. These people are real and so is what they have done https://t.co/72PJpI45qk
@SexCounseling @cam14132788 @realDonaldTrump It is their job. Trump was warned before the election Russia was trying to infiltrate his campaign. Carter Paige had already become a target before he was on the campaign. Flynn was caught early and trump still hired him. This is what they should have done. Trump hired criminals https://t.co/CAKWwTPKXR
@SexCounseling @cam14132788 @realDonaldTrump You do realize the McCabe thing is what’s really a hoax? He didn’t start any investigation he simply added to it. You’re so ignorant you don’t know how ignorant you are.
@SexCounseling @cam14132788 @realDonaldTrump As far as russia there have been too many guilty pleas and convictions to call the investigation a hoax. Once again objective reality disagrees with you.
@SexCounseling @cam14132788 @realDonaldTrump Lmao! You asked if I believe in socialism and of course I believe it exists. That’s an objective truth. It like every other political or economic philosophy has many variations, another fact. I’m not quite sure what part of reality you are calling untrue.
@SexCounseling @cam14132788 @realDonaldTrump The trump campaign or trump is the question Muller is investigating. That and his blatant obstruction of justice. His own words have hung him there.
@SexCounseling @cam14132788 @realDonaldTrump We know without a doubt Russia meddled, that has been proven. We know also by guilty pleas trumps team lied about many Russian dealings. We know many things illegal involving Russia have occurred, every intelligence agency agrees. Wether or not a conspiracy occurred with 1/2
@SexCounseling @cam14132788 @realDonaldTrump Public services like schools, roads, hospitals, military, utilities, nd the list goes on. Do I believe in some socialist programs, yes. Socialism as government no. Take this chart in health insurance and see if it makes sense https://t.co/2j2QWtsd6Q
@SexCounseling @cam14132788 @realDonaldTrump That question is really worded poorly. Of course socialism exists. Socialism exists in many forms and they vary greatly when you talk about socialist governments, economies, or policies. We are already economically a social democracy meaning tax payer funds pay for certain 1/2

@nursevictoria11 No but he did agree to civil unions and that same sex couples should have the same legal protections. Gabbard literally compared my marriage to incest, beastiality, pedophilia, and “just plain weird”. No, if you ever thought people deserved fewer rights than you you have no
@realDonaldTrump He is one of the dumbest Texas has to offer and completely ignored his constitutional duties since being elected. He works to enrich himself and nothing more. I’m sure that’s why he is so quiet about you, Russian money
@SexCounseling @cam14132788 @realDonaldTrump I’m saying your entire claim is absolutely false, made up, not true, a lie, conspiracy, fake news
@SexCounseling @cam14132788 @realDonaldTrump I am saying Clinton could not sell a Canadian company to Russia. The uranium they mine here can not leave the states.

@SexCounseling @realDonaldTrump Maybe your school didn’t teach what is evidence and what is a claim?

Why was carter Paige meeting with Russians. Why did Flynn lie? Why did they all lie? Why have so many been convicted is it was “nothing”?
@SexCounseling @realDonaldTrump You come up with conspiracies about Clinton because you can not defend trump. It’s pathetic.
@SexCounseling @realDonaldTrump Nice try though. Explain how the sale of a Canadian mining company was Clinton’s gain? The uranium mined can’t leave the states. Explain it as you understand it.

@4truthnjustiz @NBCNews The fact is students sit out the pledge everyday for many reasons. Some it’s racism, some it’s because it now includes a god myth. The reasons are irrelevant and the only person who should be questioned as to their reasons would be the teacher who broke the law.
@4truthnjustiz @NBCNews ROFLMAO! Your words and their implications are all I have addressed. Maybe bone up on the definition of freedom or the law? Then you might not find yourself making ignorant statements that people call out publicly?
@4truthnjustiz @NBCNews No that is he implication of your words, nothing else. This has been settled in the courts, all the way up to the Supreme Court. No need for “discussion” or singling the student out, only firing and suing.
@BillOReilly No they would be horrified at conservatives just like they were back then. Remember conservatives were loyal to the crown and everything they despised. Conservatives have been wrong on every issue.

@jharwood14 @NBCNews What makes me sick is adults so ignorant of the constitution and incapable of conceiving what freedom means. Forced participation in school for the pledge is illegal in all 50 states and territories. Forced patriotism is fascism not freedom.

@BentTailXEyes @genenevada @NRA @RepArmstrongND Again, this only applies to dealers. No federal laws require background check on private sales. These were legal sales with no final check thanks to the law.

@BentTailXEyes @genenevada @NRA @RepArmstrongND Unless it’s  sale via the internet or social media, a friend of a friend. A person you know from work. There are so many instances where people could sell a gun unknowingly to a felon. Close the loophole instead of defending it
@BentTailXEyes @genenevada @NRA @RepArmstrongND Lmao! No it does not require a background check from private sales or transfers.
@BentTailXEyes @genenevada @NRA @RepArmstrongND Unless you’re a private seller.
@BentTailXEyes @genenevada @NRA @RepArmstrongND Lmao! And since you as a private seller are NOT REQUIRED to do background checks you are not expected to “reasonably” know the persons history. Why are defending a loophole that hurts only people who should not have guns? Right here is the problem.
@BentTailXEyes @genenevada @NRA @RepArmstrongND Private sales are not regulated that way so it happens time and again where these people buy guns from individuals.
@BentTailXEyes @genenevada @NRA @RepArmstrongND There is no legal requirement for it.
@BentTailXEyes @genenevada @NRA @RepArmstrongND You are correct, I am wrong. I do ask again how this applies to private sales and transfers where no check is required by the seller ?
@BentTailXEyes @genenevada @NRA @RepArmstrongND You can not be charged is you have no burden of doing a background check unless it can be proven you knew.
@BentTailXEyes @genenevada @NRA @RepArmstrongND It’s so cute you think they’re all going to offer the information
@BentTailXEyes @genenevada @NRA @RepArmstrongND Lmao! Yes of course I was talking about in a theater that actually was on fire. I also said “so to speak”. Your dishonesty is incredible. I guess that’s all you’ve got when you’re trying to defend lies with lies
@BentTailXEyes @genenevada @NRA @RepArmstrongND But as you have pointed out criminals will break the law so let’s require background checks on all sales and transfers and make the seller responsible as well.
@BentTailXEyes @genenevada @NRA @RepArmstrongND Felony domestic abuse, not all

@genenevada @NRA @RepArmstrongND Well many scotus rulings disagree with you. I’ll go with them.
@genenevada @BentTailXEyes @NRA @RepArmstrongND The laws do not address private sales or transfers, not all states ban domestic abusers, we need expanded mental health checks. No those things are not addressed by current laws
@BentTailXEyes @genenevada @NRA @RepArmstrongND Lmao! No but it is illegal to yell to fire in a crowded theater so to speak. Even speech is not an unlimited right.
@genenevada @BentTailXEyes @NRA @RepArmstrongND Criminals don’t obey they law but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have laws. Lmao! The arguments and critical thought of a ten year old
@genenevada @BentTailXEyes @NRA @RepArmstrongND No making it harder doesn’t violate the constitution. There is a mountain of precedent to back that up in scotus rulings. Undue burdens which this is not.
@genenevada @NRA @RepArmstrongND No they don’t
@mrshannon0 @NRA @RepArmstrongND Yes and too bad no constitutional right is unlimited and regulations are not inherently unconstitutional. SCOTUS has ruled that time and again.
@BentTailXEyes @NRA @RepBenCline I can get a gun from a stranger and open carry in Texas. No background check, no license, nothing.
@BentTailXEyes @NRA @RepBenCline Yes but it’s not a crime to sell or give a gun to someone with out doing a background check moron.
@BentTailXEyes @NRA @RepArmstrongND They should be tough, gun deaths are at 40 year highs. We’ve had more than two dozen school shootings last year.
@NRA @RepBenCline Bullish!t. No one is trying to restrict the rights of people to own guns except those who shouldn’t have them. I have to ask why you are ok with no background checks on private sales and omestic abusers having guns?
@NRA @RepArmstrongND Regulations aren’t inherently unconstitutional liar

@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder And that’s not the same as blackface to appear to be a black person, false equivalence
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder I’m not, I’m agreeing with the majority of black people
@dillzilla99 @samswey Doubtful
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder The history is inescapable and again, a white person telling black people it’s not racist is really cute but ignorant and privileged
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder And the history of blackface is why you as a white person dont get to try and excuse this. This isn’t about just painting your face black. Blackface is only white people painting their faces to appear black, a black person.
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder That’s it’s origin
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder It had nothing to do with coal miners. That’s propaganda

@dillzilla99 @samswey Wrong
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder Oh yes poor you, people will call you out for being an ignorant ass if you do this, how awful for you. The persecution complex is astounding.
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder In fact it is flat out delusional
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder It is a historical fact that blackface was created as a means of mocking black people and dehumanizing them. It’s absurd to deny that.
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder Yes it absolutely factually objectively does.
@dillzilla99 @samswey Lmao! Nice attempt to deflect
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder Wow, complete lack of reading comprehension. Microwaves were not created solely as a means of oppression, dehumanizing, or racism. It’s a false equivalence, not even in the same galaxy
@dillzilla99 @samswey I know you’re white, don’t even try to lie
@dillzilla99 @samswey No I’m against racism and you’re trying to excuse things that are inherently racist.
@dillzilla99 @samswey Except for black people. Microwaves do not represent that, we’re not created for that. It’s another false equivalence and you trying to justify something that is inherently racist as ok
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder That’s the entire problem, privilege
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder It does for black people
@dillzilla99 @samswey Minimizing or normalizing things like this is not ok
@dillzilla99 @samswey Because some things are never ok. What’s worse, no key or the N word? I’m going with the word I would get banned for tweeting and we all refer to as “the N word”.
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder It’s due to its origins that make it never ok. Your inability to understand that is evidence of your privilege
@dillzilla99 @samswey As a white man I understand my privilege because as a gay man I also understand the discrimination. There is no irony in pointing out fact
@dillzilla99 @samswey Black face was created as a means to dehumanize
@dillzilla99 @samswey False equivalence
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder Which is never ok due to its origin being equating black people to monkeys. It’s just never ok
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder ROFLMAO! Wow, that’s hilarious. The history of the costume was to mock black people and make them out to be monkeys, that’s it’s origin you idiot.
@dillzilla99 @samswey Like a privileged straight white man
@dillzilla99 @samswey No you just deny some things are inherently racist regardless of context
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder The very fact you think it’s a display of admiration show you’re ignorant
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder Lmao! So yes, you’re totally ignorant of it’s history. Typical white man who has never had his rights called into question.
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder It is a display of ignorance, arrogance, and privilege
@dillzilla99 @samswey Wrong, there are some things that are racist, period. It’s ignorance and privilege that a white guy thinks it’s ever ok.
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder Halloween costumes are not what you suggest. Name a situation where one would be in blackface for Halloween as a display of how it’s bad? Then consider the fact that still does not make it not racist
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder That’s a display of ignorance
@dillzilla99 @samswey No it doesn’t. White people dont get to decide if their intent makes it ok, that’s just racist.
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder No it does not. It is not ok to wear something that is a symbol of hate, death, suffering, racism, discrimination, murder, rape, and owning another human being. It’s not a costume, it’s off limits because it’s so atrocious. Any non sociopath should be able to see that.
@dillzilla99 @samswey The context of Halloween and going to a party or trick or treating? That’s the context
@dillzilla99 @samswey @scrowder A comic is not a Halloween costume. A movie is not a Halloween costume. Is a klan rove racist as a Halloween costume?
@dillzilla99 @samswey Is a nazi outfit not anti Semitic?
@dillzilla99 @samswey Is a klan costume racist?
@dillzilla99 @samswey It’s racist due to the history of blackface, period. Just like the N word, there is no context where it is not a racist word. It’s invention was as a racist term, just like blackface.  Maybe your ignorance of blackface is the problem.
@dillzilla99 @samswey And that’s an opinion. Blackface for any reason is racist, period. Even if you’re so ignorant you don’t get why, it’s still racist.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump So because they didn’t cave you’re going to go ahead and break a promise YOU already made to these people? I ask again, who were you fu@king, how old was he, and who has the proof?

@dillzilla99 @samswey Here is the context https://t.co/DxoyMWiu1S
@phoenixmacleod1 @samswey This says 65% of white people just don’t get it. If only 35% agree it’s never acceptable then 65% think it is in some form. As a white person I have to ask again, WTF white people?
@samswey So that totals over 60% of white folks are ignorant or racist. Does it say what percentage of white people are tired of racists and are constantly asking “WTF white peoples?”

@HHypocrisy101 Keep projecting

@HHypocrisy101 Fascism has a definition, you do realize that? https://t.co/0IkNq6UdEl
@HHypocrisy101 Taking things away? Lmao! Only some imagined right to privilege maybe.
@HHypocrisy101 Well actually I have opened my house to several homeless people but you will call that grand standing. The fact is a wall doesn’t equal security nor is it required at the border. No false equivalence will change that
@HHypocrisy101 There it is, thinking your opinion or common sense is real,y relevant in these situations with so many unknowns. A perfect example of Dunning Kruger
@HHypocrisy101 More racist propaganda. Families seeking asylum which is legal. Your fear mongering and propaganda don’t change that or make it “aggression”
@HHypocrisy101 Go ahead and prove me wrong. I need cited sources for claims that are factually incorrect yes.
@HHypocrisy101 Lmao! Yes yes, the good old “you’re so bigoted against bigots” and “you’re so intolerant of intolerance” game.

@HHypocrisy101 @SteveCathy1 @4YrsToday Morality isn’t religious wing nut. Lmao! I citing your hypocrisy as your handle describes
@HHypocrisy101 @SteveCathy1 @4YrsToday Yes I do and grabbing anyone by their genitals without consent is defined as assault, objective fact. If you assert or even imply this is just “human nature” somehow you’re not safe to be free in society.
@HHypocrisy101 Yeah because that ridiculous false equivalence has never been attempted before. Another display of zero intellect
@HHypocrisy101 Lmao! There’s more of that bigotry and lack of thought. Yes it must be us vs them, both aren’t possible. You’re such a sociopath it’s almost sad
@HHypocrisy101 So what you’re saying is you don’t know the definition of those words? Lmao! Your comment about caring about us first and “no one cares” is text book xenophobia. Lmao! Wow, you’re really dumb.
@HHypocrisy101 I think you misunderstand what’s going on here. I’m not “clutching my pearls” I’m simply pointing out the lack of morals in trump and you try to play whataboutism. It speaks volumes to your lack of morals that you will lie to defend this.
@HHypocrisy101 @SteveCathy1 @4YrsToday Lmao! There is nothing to be ashamed of, I stated a fact.
@HHypocrisy101 @SteveCathy1 @4YrsToday No what adults with zero evidence and lack of critical thinking claim to be true. They make claims even though many claims in texts like the Bible have been proven false.
@HHypocrisy101 @SteveCathy1 @4YrsToday No most Americans aren’t sociopaths. You and your circle of course share common ideologies but every poll shows you’re wrong.
@HHypocrisy101 @SteveCathy1 @4YrsToday “Lusting”? No we are talking about “assault” not lust. Grab them by the pussy without asking is assault. Jesus you’re dishonest prick

@HHypocrisy101 @SteveCathy1 @4YrsToday Obama also did not take kids from their parents those were unaccompanied minors. He also was suede and rightfully so. That ruling, the Flores ruling is what trump is currently violating with thousands of kids.
@HHypocrisy101 @SteveCathy1 @4YrsToday Lmao! Another trump supporter who denies reports and admissions from his own administration. In fact they just released a report last week that says they took thousands more children than previously reported and they have no way to return them. They don’t know who they go to.
@HHypocrisy101 @SteveCathy1 @4YrsToday We are talking health insurance here not insurance in general.
@HHypocrisy101 @SteveCathy1 @4YrsToday Lmao! That’s a lie
@HHypocrisy101 @SteveCathy1 @4YrsToday If you can do that I’ll be impressed.
@HHypocrisy101 @SteveCathy1 @4YrsToday Tell me what purpose for profit health insurance serves? What do they “create” or “innovate”? Explain why it needs to be for profit and why it’s a good thing?
@HHypocrisy101 @SteveCathy1 @4YrsToday “Affordable” that offered junk coverage and had pre existing condition limits on them went away yes. Those plans caused millions of Americans to loose everything over the years. Have a heart attack and your broke without a home.

@SussexFriends @4ILorg Israel is an apartheid state, period. That’s not about religion or individuals it’s about the policy of the country and the human rights abuses they commit.
@dottcomm1 @seanflanagan43 This doesn’t change when they do bomb schools and hospitals with kids. This just proves they didn’t use kids as shields.
@dottcomm1 @seanflanagan43 No it’s claimed by Israel not proven. What is proven is Israel uses “knock” bombs to “alert” people they’re about to bomb.  It gets people in the streets running and greatly increases fatalities.
@dottcomm1 @seanflanagan43 No Israel claims that to justify bombing the hospitals
@dottcomm1 @seanflanagan43 No they don’t use Human shields. Jesus that’s total but of propaganda.

@dottcomm1 @seanflanagan43 Israel does this daily so I doubt it’s staged
@seanflanagan43 @dottcomm1 The reality is that this is part of a pattern of abuses by Israel that drive, feed, and create groups like Hamas. It’s an apartheid state where even Arab Christians are abused. It isn’t just one side that is creating the violence.
@seanflanagan43 @dottcomm1 Then why would the IDF fear being shot themselves?
@seanflanagan43 @dottcomm1 Do you see any guns? Do you imply it’s plausible they had them and took IDF more than 32 seconds to respond after they got rid of the guns?

@PixieKWH @100PercFEDUP @gatewaypundit @IlhanMN @Barnes_Law No they aren’t when they’re doing it to the opposing teams black players. They even don blackface for games to taunt. But it sure is fun to see all the racists come out to deny ds a https://t.co/Uk3zC39Vr0

@ColoradoKev1 @100PercFEDUP @gatewaypundit @IlhanMN @Barnes_Law Yes yes, another conservative who doesn’t understand political philosophies have objective definitions. Those were conservatives
@ColoradoKev1 @100PercFEDUP @gatewaypundit @IlhanMN @Barnes_Law No talking about white nationalists but you’re trying to dishonestly claim that’s all white people is indeed a typical bit of racist propaganda. Bravo
@ColoradoKev1 @100PercFEDUP @gatewaypundit @IlhanMN @Barnes_Law Lmao! Oh look, another dishonest white boy with a persecution complex. White supremacy is not just being white. I say this as a white man from the south, everybody knows you’re lying and it’s pathetic.
@ColoradoKev1 @100PercFEDUP @gatewaypundit @IlhanMN @Barnes_Law Yes the historical truth of this being a white power symbol is easily proven.
@jltechie @100PercFEDUP @gatewaypundit @IlhanMN @Barnes_Law Liar

@weirdralph @gatewaypundit What part of “you must own the gun to be in possession of or use it” restricts ownership or makes it a burden? Lmao! We aren’t anti second amendment, none of the rights in the constitution are unlimited.
@TomBice1 @gatewaypundit Why? It is not a burden for gun owners and in no way restricts their rights t own guns. It does help stop people who can’t legally purchase guns from getting them from friends.
@gatewaypundit Good, too many people with records who shouldn’t own guns get them from friends.
@100PercFEDUP @gatewaypundit @IlhanMN Smearing? Well maybe those boys shouldn’t have called black people nigger or native Americans tomahawk? Maybe they should not have acted like privileged racist twats while chaperones stood by and did nothing. We all know the truth about you and those like you.

@N7_DallyJr @lucestella18 @DebraMessing In fact the very words he says here he said many times. If you have ever thought I deserved fewer rights you have no place in elected office period. No compromise, no exceptions.
@N7_DallyJr @lucestella18 @DebraMessing No he said he did not support laws defending gay rights but that t was more a civil issue. I paid very good attention as I have been an activist since the 80s.

@leewhelan999999 @ewarren @realDonaldTrump Lmao! Again it could show zero and her ancestors could have been Native American. Hers shows a minute amount. I can’t believe this is more important that grabbing women by the pussy.

@DonaldJTrumpJr Nothing like posting lies.
@leewhelan999999 @ewarren @realDonaldTrump So you have no idea how DNA works? One of her parents could be fully half Native American and she could have zero Native American DNA. Lmao!

@KurtGibson1 @Rosiebhappy @CMWooly @DavidHutcheso11 @VoteBlueNMWho @RepSwalwell And that doesn’t excuse his criminality or make it go away
@KurtGibson1 @Rosiebhappy @CMWooly @DavidHutcheso11 @VoteBlueNMWho @RepSwalwell They haven’t worked with him for decades except those tied to the mob. Lmao! He has bankrupted countless contractors by refusing to pay his bills.
@realDonaldTrump Wow, you even fail at this. As a white person I am so sick of your ignorance and racism. It’s Black History Month and all black people are not “African” Americans or defended from Africans. You’re a disgrace and moron.
@CMWooly @KurtGibson1 @Rosiebhappy @DavidHutcheso11 @VoteBlueNMWho @RepSwalwell The assertion that she and Obama “sold” anything is hilarious. They had no say in the sale nor the authority to do so. They could have fought the sale but why?
@CMWooly @KurtGibson1 @Rosiebhappy @DavidHutcheso11 @VoteBlueNMWho @RepSwalwell I think Stanley Kubrick has a better twitter handle for Kurt here. Eyes Wide Shut
@CMWooly @KurtGibson1 @Rosiebhappy @DavidHutcheso11 @VoteBlueNMWho @RepSwalwell Let’s also remember Uranium One was a Canadian Company not actual Uranium. They have mining rights in the US that is all.
@KurtGibson1 @Rosiebhappy @CMWooly @DavidHutcheso11 @VoteBlueNMWho @RepSwalwell Wow, you are so terribly uninformed or just flat out lying. These are not allegations, these are fact.
@KurtGibson1 @Rosiebhappy @CMWooly @DavidHutcheso11 @VoteBlueNMWho @RepSwalwell They didn’t go after anyone. He made some comments and they proceeded to jack up prices more. Lmao!
@KurtGibson1 @Rosiebhappy @CMWooly @DavidHutcheso11 @VoteBlueNMWho @RepSwalwell There are claims about this deal, no evidence, none. It’s a conspiracy originating in Desouzas book. Lmao! Even he admits there isn’t evidence, it’s all conjecture.
@KurtGibson1 @Rosiebhappy @CMWooly @DavidHutcheso11 @VoteBlueNMWho @RepSwalwell Yes yes, a Canadian owned company called Uranium One was sold to a majority share Russian owned company that Clinton has no stake in. Where is the evidence of pay to play?
@KurtGibson1 @Rosiebhappy @CMWooly @DavidHutcheso11 @VoteBlueNMWho @RepSwalwell Raked in billions? Yes and that money was not spent paying off porn stars to shield a campaign. The Clinton foundation has actually spent the money on charities. There is no evidence of pay to play, just your random claims with zero evidence.
@KurtGibson1 @Rosiebhappy @CMWooly @DavidHutcheso11 @VoteBlueNMWho @RepSwalwell Actually it was proven and they were ordered to close and banned from running a not for profit in NY.
@CMWooly @KurtGibson1 @Rosiebhappy @DavidHutcheso11 @VoteBlueNMWho @RepSwalwell He has no clue what Uranium One is or the deal but he is certain is was illegal somehow. Typical Fox News idiot. That’s what happens when people watch State Run Media
@KurtGibson1 @Rosiebhappy @CMWooly @DavidHutcheso11 @VoteBlueNMWho @RepSwalwell Let’s get back to your foundation lies, I mean claims. Let’s discuss foundation vs foundation and which one has been ordered dissolved due to illegal activities?
@KurtGibson1 @Rosiebhappy @CMWooly @DavidHutcheso11 @VoteBlueNMWho @RepSwalwell Lmao! By hirin oil execs to lead the EPA? Is that a good example?
@KurtGibson1 @CMWooly @DavidHutcheso11 @VoteBlueNMWho @RepSwalwell No you’ve made stupid claims and danced around claiming some imagined victory. It’s amazing how people claim to be logical and “eyes wide open” are the b st examples of Dunning Kruger effect we have
@KurtGibson1 @Rosiebhappy @CMWooly @DavidHutcheso11 @VoteBlueNMWho @RepSwalwell No evidence of pay to play especially since it was a Canadian company. Lmao!
@Rosiebhappy @KurtGibson1 @CMWooly @DavidHutcheso11 @VoteBlueNMWho @RepSwalwell Now I’m curious why you think there is a mind behind these beliefs and assertions? Lol
@Rosiebhappy @KurtGibson1 @CMWooly @DavidHutcheso11 @VoteBlueNMWho @RepSwalwell Because whataboutism is as close to a defense of trump he can come up with.
@KurtGibson1 @CMWooly @DavidHutcheso11 @VoteBlueNMWho @RepSwalwell Yes yes, Obama still had better job creation numbers, better gdp numbers, and was better respected. Those are facts. If not show me wrong?
@DavidHutcheso11 @KurtGibson1 @CMWooly @VoteBlueNMWho @RepSwalwell Let’s look at the debt or deficit? Let’s looks at his lies? Let’s look at his bigotry? I know, kids being locked up after kidnapping them? How about being laughed at in front of the whole world when speaking at the UN? The man is a failure, incompetent, ignorant, and a sociopath.

@KurtGibson1 @PoliticalShort @SebGorka Lmao! None relating to Russia? Seriously? That’s hilarious.
@janforney1 @joncoopertweets That’s not entirely true. These large medical campuses are actually saving money by providing comprehensive care not just for procedures but afterwards. For profit insurance is a separate industry that provides no goods or services and exists solely to make profit off the sick
@KurtGibson1 @PoliticalShort @SebGorka Wiki leaks and Russian hacked emails but had nothing to do with dirt on Clinton. That’s a good one.

@BerningBlue @RalphCo24419177 @Ellahbie His love of communism was loud and clear. His support of those regimes was loud and clear. “Sister cities” and a honeymoon in 1998 Soviet Russia and you seriously think this is guy to come in behind the Russian asset number 1? ridiculous
@BerningBlue @RalphCo24419177 @Ellahbie No she used the threat of jail to scare mothers into doing what needed to be done to protect the children. I spent years working with homeless kids and have done the same. The kids matter more, period.
@BerningBlue @RalphCo24419177 @Ellahbie He spent his honeymoon in Russia and called Moscow a “sister city”.
@BerningBlue @RalphCo24419177 @Ellahbie This is what I mean about Bernie supporters being so much like trump supporters, willing to buy or deny anything that defends him. It’s insane. We need to question everything especially what we believe to be true.
@BerningBlue @RalphCo24419177 @Ellahbie I do not agree with the headline of the video but it isn’t my YouTube. This is from 1988 		https://t.co/fPavA0L8ra
@BerningBlue @RalphCo24419177 @Ellahbie He absolutely supported those regimes. Publicly and proudly. He invited them to visit in defiance of Reagan. He violated the embargo with Nicaragua. He actively defended and supported, lobbied for those regimes. That’s fact
@BerningBlue @RalphCo24419177 @Ellahbie No he publicly did those things in the 80s. Maybe you weren’t alive for it or don’t know it but yes he absolutely did.
@BerningBlue @RalphCo24419177 @Ellahbie She was remembering the time she got through to a woman with yes a threat but she did so to help the kids. Why did Sanders defend the Sandinistas? The USSR? People convicted of espionage?
@BerningBlue @RalphCo24419177 @Ellahbie Did sanders throw his morals out when he gave up abolishing the military and CIA or his defense of Soviet Russia and Communist China? Should ignore that and look at policy since they were both in a position to make policy or stay in the past? I’ll do that but let’s look at policy
@BerningBlue @RalphCo24419177 @Ellahbie She didn’t grow her morals out and spoke out against the laws and policy. That doesn’t mean she can just not do her job, look at the current administration to see where that gets you.
@Ellahbie @RevoltPolitic @lars10_lc I refuse to trade one Russian asset for another. His history with soviet Russia, Nicaragua, and communist China is not ok. His support of them and desire to do away with the military in the past leave him just to crazy or crazy adjacent to consider.
@Ellahbie @RevoltPolitic @lars10_lc No Bernie is very much Ford in many ways and not the man to help unite and recover from the damage of this administration. He lacks any real credibility with a good portion of liberals and many independents. That’s Ford post pardon 100%.
@MaguireRobbie @realDonaldTrump Another racist twat from across the pond. Sit down and shut up you stupid bell end
@realDonaldTrump What an idiot. No when you came into office we had inspectors on the ground 24/7 now we have none. When you came into office N Korea had fewer nuke sites than they do now. Why do you go against all US intelligence agencies in favor of those of our enemies?
@MaguireRobbie @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/b2FmgWnwKm
@Ellahbie @RevoltPolitic @lars10_lc The fact is we need an FDR not a Gerald Ford
@Ellahbie @RevoltPolitic @lars10_lc No this isn’t poor bashing this is simo,y laying Bernie’s history and policy, his own actions and words.

@WhiteHouse @GOP They are smuggling them through legal ports of entry, through tunnels, planes, boats, and people. These are huge operations that aren’t just driving through the desert. These cases make up less than 10% of drugs coming across the border. We need tech and people not a wall.
