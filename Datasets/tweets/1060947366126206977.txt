@BillKristol I like that tweet
@realDonaldTrump yes we do, but at the same time other countries help us to, let us not forget the things they do to.
@seanmdav good one, good point
@realDonaldTrump really it has a lot of bad history. Minorites from other countries don't like us like that.. KKK been in the white house. I thought that's why you ran to fix it but damn just like your mother and father I see.
@IngrahamAngle @JussieSmollett I did, but I wanted to see how far he was going to take it
@RealDLHughley all eyez on him for real. What the hell was he thinking
@realDonaldTrump Is that not the pot calling the kettle black, no need for harsh words
You don't have a border and that is not your country, USA is wrong, but hey the politics here been doing this for years https://t.co/5A0iNyEcci
@realDonaldTrump everything is fake but what  you say, even when you get caught in a lie you still won't tell the truth. Just stop already
Then why is America funding it to come here. Don't play part and not the other. You allowed it, the first step is taking responsibility for your actions https://t.co/2qa9mDB59t
@RealDLHughley I didn't think that was real anyway. Its funny as hell though

@realFionaV @R2017Girl @RepMattGaetz I would anything better than America, racist, child molesters who allow people to take kids and then blame the same people working the jobs they are to lazy to do. I encourage you to change your racist ways
@realFionaV @R2017Girl @RepMattGaetz oh and I am for the right side, a better country, a better place to live. Look at how we are living, its not that great
@realFionaV @R2017Girl @RepMattGaetz look how that worked for them, we don't need it. The government is not telling the truth. They just tell you what you want to hear instead so calm down
@OpMindQrime it might seem like but no, when we have to vote for one or the other then what do have left. The thing is do we want to continue with this or move forward. Both sides needs to be fixed but Trump needs to go
@RealDLHughley so true FBF
A lot of these countries don't want the USA in their land or business cause KKK is in the office. The damage they have done in America they don't want. Yes its problems in their country and they need help, but look at how we ended up. We need a better leader https://t.co/xCr332zHtq
They are not even protecting the citizens here first of all. All the crime we have here. I see we are dealing with the Haves and Have not. More than just American built the USA just admit it already https://t.co/Gs4NCBRKRH

@realDonaldTrump Can you have the same empathy for Mexico and their people. They did make them ugly ass hats you know
what I want to know is what is Cruz getting out of this. Nothing is free. How much money is he being promised https://t.co/nslmR08SiO
@SenSanders I agree, if you let him get away with this then he will think he can do what ever he wants and that is not true. We have to follow laws so he should to.
@BarbaraMillig19 @JohnCornyn thanks for the fan reply have a great day
@OpMindQrime @RepMattGaetz thanks for the fan love have a great day
@R2017Girl @RepMattGaetz USA is known for lying to minorities and taking their land. They can come work but not live. Matter of fact Texas is Mexico so they need to get out, just think about that.  This is a melting pot of races that already live and work here. So they have to go to
@Elliemae_2U @RepMattGaetz one problem at time, politics is nasty game of power but do we really want KKK in the white house look at how the world is because of the choices they made years ago, just think about that
@mckeag_brent @RepMattGaetz I wish the fuck I would praise the KKK, I am not a slave period and money makes things go away this is not a movie, this is real life. IF you only knew what really goes on in the street you would go and run to a hole and hide. Lets not play games, especially with me.
@hammegk ask Trump Admin for since everyone is hell bent on running the white house. The FBI is only doing their job and if Trump wasn't doing anything then they would be on someone else
@thewizardofawe @RepMattGaetz well Trump should been the biggest rat in the picture but hey love the meme
@realFionaV @R2017Girl @RepMattGaetz well if you know god so much then you know he would not want that wall. Stop using religion as a way to get your way. Let the first on without sin stand up and my friend you to are not an angel
@Trump2020Yuge I know right lol
@Trump2020Yuge @RepMattGaetz no, why would so many people try to do this, money make things go away and just remember his family ties, they got his back when no one else does. He is committing crimes and it will come out watch what I say
@AndrewGillum I'm with you on that one
@RepMattGaetz I think the truth is going to come and when it do I want to remind of what you said. He is not telling the truth, but wait it's coming out
@BernieSanders spoke the truth on that one, and the wall is getting more attention cause Trump wants to scam people

America is one big melting pot, how can one race not be allowed but the others can. Sounds like some slavery type stuff. They can make your hats and cut your grass, clean up buildings and work in factories but they can't come to live.	MODREN DAY SLAVERY..ijs https://t.co/fbFQlrz4I4
@realDonaldTrump But if you connect the dots, it just looks funny. Your wife is not even American. Its ok for her to be here but the families in Mexico  can't come across the border.. IJS it just looks weird
@kimguilfoyle since he got the wall know he is going to turn this into a third world country making us do what he wants, well damn
@StevenTDennis fake POTUS and fake numbers its a lot of other things going on in which he has not even touched but wait and see
@realDonaldTrump can you use that same energy in the foster care system, sex trafficking. I hope you don't scam them out that money cause that is what corporations do
@seungminkim that's just racist, your fine right where you at my friend
@SenSanders that's the problem no one is thinking about family first and if we had that mind frame not all but some things would be so much better
@realDonaldTrump what about the crime you can't even solve in America. This is not going to work. The blame game always ends up bad
I just want to remind people when your pointing the finger at someone just know  that you have three other fingers pointing back at you. Let us not forget where we came from and how your culture got here.. Respect it good or bad... https://t.co/eun8mGOdYt
@SenTedCruz what about the foster in which sex trafficking is really at. Everyone is so hell bent on all the criminals come from Mexico but forgets all the illegal crime we have. CRUZ nice last name.. Don't forget where you came from cause they don't like you either.. SAD
@realDonaldTrump so convicting El Chapo is how your funding the wall, shame the government never let the other side have their say but we have to believe what you tell us like you tell the truth WOW
@kasie really that is compromise, no one will like it but this is not burger king and you not going to have it your way
@SenSchumer If we let him do it for what ever the real reason is then he is going to think he can get away with anything-- just a thought
@KamalaHarris I really am for guns but not at the risk of the children. The parents can't control the kids then what are we suppose to let the other children die for bad parenting..
@newtgingrich does sound kinda weird, when all that you named is processed foods that's not even real, good point though
@KamalaHarris so right we are so much better and I love this tweet

@realDonaldTrump No we will still have crime period, nothing is perfect but reducing it is key. Stop making checks that America can not cash. YOU play to much. What about the homeless. All resources are being taken away. How can they make it? Some people just lost their job.
@realDonaldTrump Its lots of crime, police killing people, homeless running the street not including the white collar crimes that you fail to mention. WE already got problems and you still talking about the wall
@JohnCornyn @PromiseHouse @nfnlnews @Traffick911 Can they help me with Judge Van Orden Kidnapping my children

@TalibKweli @RobertZapp @MattBel38831489 @OpticsKing @DaturaDelirium @DienamiteRedder No one just out right hates it but at the same damn time they just wrong, for a lot of things that's going on
@GovAbbott How can you do this and you still let Judge Van Orden be on the bench, still kidnapping my kids and you need some like oh wow, Texas the worst place to have your kids
@JohnCornyn Lets thank Mr Trump, isn't he the greatest lol
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews what about your meeting with them, lets not forget. Both sides corrupted not just one the whole system needs to be put back together, but you suppose to run the country
@realDonaldTrump Is not the kettle calling the pot black, oh I forgot you don't  like African Americans
@realDonaldTrump Fake Term in history rather
@bpolitics @business was he not just for this, and look how he just lies and make shit up. Then gets mad at Fake News, but FAKE HIMSELF

@realDonaldTrump Police kills people everyday and yet you praise them for their work. Every race has bad apples
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You are playing with our lives, can you try to do something about the homeless. All those people are not criminals and you know it. Don't have them come over here and help build it then send them home.
@realDonaldTrump The dream died with King and you even know that, Lets start with this system. We don't have time for games these are peoples lives you are playing with
@realDonaldTrump Yes you can if they start doing the right thing, stop the corruption in America is overrated. Lets try making a better system cause it broke America
@realDonaldTrump Crime will still be up due to the corrupt system we have, so miss up with that. This has been going on for to long lets start with the Judicial System and then we can talk about that
@realDonaldTrump Does not make you right, 85 people died and all you are talking about is a wall that does not matter come on

@realDonaldTrump that's the pot calling the kettle black, what did you do and its not all pretty from what I heard
@realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich did under a lie and we don't need that. Let make America great again by helping the homeless and stop talking about that wall cause we do matter
@realDonaldTrump UMM it people in poverty that need housing and jobs and I don't see where that help just let me know
@realDonaldTrump But the homeless people need help, thought you was making America great again.
@realDonaldTrump don't forget its cold outside and millions of homeless people are outside, needing housing why you out here talking about a wall. It is tunnels under the ground, what is the point. Oh by the way Texas is Mexico, or did we all forget
@realDonaldTrump Um the wall thing is getting old the homeless  needs the attention, it is other things we need done. Our children is out here dying to human trafficking and yet you seem like you dont care what if that was your kids
@realDonaldTrump well if that's the case we need you talking about the homeless cause that issue needs all the attention. That wall looks and sounds like a scam. But hey you know this man. So put us first and help us first
@JosephNSanberg that is so true, we need someone who is really going to do it cause I swear we have to many dummies doing all the wrong things
