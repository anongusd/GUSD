@wesbury Check my twitter feed from Friday where I repeatedly advocated Q4/Q4 as the better measure, you’ll find the formula for annual average growth rates there. Anything that happened in 2017-Q1 shows up equally in the every quarter in 17 and 18 and thus doesn’t affect the growth rate.
@wesbury Actually, it's the weighted average of three quarters in 2017 and four quarters in 2018.

@SirLearnsaloteh Guilty.
@MichaelRStrain I'll meet you halfway: expensing permanent and a higher rate.
@amandhania That's de facto the formula for annual average growth (formula is also 2018 level over 2017 level). That is the number everyone always highlights, both the statistical agencies and the news media. But I agree that looked at this way no sane person would pay attention to it.
I'm not seeing a sustained supply-side expansion in the wake of the tax cut. https://t.co/9eIz6bPdXN
Note, the annual average growth rate is a strange weighted average of the previous seven quarters: (2017Q2 + 2*2017Q3 + 3*2017Q3 + 4*2018Q1 + 3*2018Q2 + 2*2018Q3 + 2018Q4)/16		That is much less of a sensible way to look at the economy than just averaging the last four quarters.
Investment growth has picked up a lot in the last two. Much but not all due to higher oil prices leading to more oil-related investment.		In the last two quarters investment growth has slowed. Much but not all due to lower oil prices leading to less oil-related investment. https://t.co/3ggBTcMryc
Mostly this tells you about demographic shifts and productivity trends shared across the advanced economies, not anything much about the current or previous President.
I have argued that there was no rational basis to predict 3% growth over the next decade. It always seemed plausible we could get a year or two of it. Looks like we won't even get that, at least in the headline annual average numbers.  https://t.co/sc8DfOLxUc
Note, the last four quarters at 3.1% is very good but not the high water mark for this business cycle. That was the 3.8% growth over the four quarters from 2014-Q1 to 2015-Q1.
Given the large amount of fiscal stimulus in 2018 is unlikely to be repeated and the labor market has less room than it did a year ago, is very likely this is a high water mark for the recent period. Growth in 2019 is tracking around 1% and potential growth is around 1.75%.
Consumption growth has held up strongly most of this year while investment began with a bang (partly temporarily elevated by oil-related investment) but ended with a whimper (partly temporarily reduced by oil-related investment).
A solid 2.6% GDP growth rate for Q4 brings the headline annual average growth rate for 2018 to 2.9% (or 3.1% for Q4/Q4 which is a better measure of how the economy actually performed in 2018).

@arindube A lot of fiscal disruption has been going on for more than a decade now totally unrelated and in most cases entirely unaware of MMT.
@arindube I could go on and on, including the IMF's Article IV's on the US economy consistently criticizing us for too much deficit reduction, the IMF and OECD papers on how fiscal stimulus would pay for itself and lower the debt/GDP ratio.
@arindube When I did my "New View" of fiscal policy speech in 2016 I had barely heard of MMT. I don't think MMT affected Olivier's Presidential address. Larry Summers has been talking about r &lt; g for many years now (at a time when the left was briefly enamored by a theory based on r &gt; g).
@ProfHayward @AustnNchols @gelbach @lenburman Yes, and the G20 agreed to this in 2009 and it still has not happened. (We had numerous proposals in our budgets but were non starters in Congress.)

@IlliniBizDean @jbarro But I don't have much patience for the form of deficit fundamentalism that is completely impervious to data. The data has changed a lot, we should modify our views on the optimal size of the debt, the macro impact of fiscal consolidation, and the priority for all of this.

@tnabielec @LItalianoVero Upsides: we already have more fiscal stimulus baked in from higher spending and lower taxes in 2019 (an extra 0.4pp of GDP above what we had in 2018). And productivity growth could actually be rising, which is one explanation of the pickup of wage growth and fall in price growth.
@NickTimiraos Actually originally reported at 416K. You need to get lost in the amazing Alfred. (And Jan 2007 was originally reported as 110K.) 		(These are minor points on your very on point observation.)		https://t.co/tofTxwQGRm
Markets are nutty and noisy. But they are at least trying to look forward. Everything in the BLS release today reflected events in the past.
And would not take TOO much reassurance from the jobs numbers. The original prints for March-May 2000 were 390K, 402K and 537K (subsequently these were revised down). That was less than a year before the recession began.
Ignoring recessions, trade wars, &amp; other risks, a substantial slowdown of growth is very likely given the low potential growth rate, falloff of fiscal stimulus, &amp; fact that we are at/near full employment.		In fact, we’re already seeing this with GDP growth slower every quarter.
The real economic data is very positive, the market is more pessimistic. I’m 75% with the economic data. But only 25% because the market is at least trying to be forward looking.

Prime age employment rate is 79.7%, exactly what it was in just before the recession (2007-Q4).		This reflects prime age male EPOP down 0.7pp from its pre-recession high while female up 0.7 pp.
The steady state job rate is ~80K if labor force participation stays constant on an age-adjusted basis. Possible LFPR structural trend is rising due to increased participation by older workers in which case could raise that a bit.		But don’t count on 200Ks much anymore.
In 2017 we had 182K jobs/month. It would likely have slowed this year but the large fiscal stimulus from federal, state and local spending increases and tax cuts boosted it to 220K jobs/month in the first 8 months of 2018. But in the last 3 months the avg has fallen back to 170K.

I’m not sure of this happy story but would love to give it the best chance it can get.
In the happy story, a stronger economy will mean more of a pickup in nominal wage growth than price growth, meaning faster real wage growth. This could be absorbed by higher productivity growth or a rise in the share of income going to labor back towards more normal levels. https://t.co/Z6Cfgos6da
But the Fed’s mandate is price stability, and price growth has actually slowed. I don’t understand why wages and prices are moving in different directions, it is very plausible that price growth will pick up again. But I don’t see much cost to a pause while we figure it out. https://t.co/KsXUGpg2Q0

My @wsjopinion argues the Fed should pause in December—continuing the excellent job they have done. I do think being ahead of the curve on inflation is AN important consideration. If inflation rises too much it could be costly to reverse. https://t.co/zqdMwvZYeC
The Fed has said it is data dependent, as it should be given that there is little reason for forward guidance when interest rates are not constrained by the effective lower bound. Following the data would say to pause in hikes until some of these data reverse themselves.
Most importantly, core CPI has only increased at a 1.6 percent annual rate since July. This is actually a slowdown relative to the 2.3 percent rate over the previous 12 months. https://t.co/MgvqFcBC2d
The international news since September has been a downside surprise, including negative growth in Germany and Japan, the slowest growth in China since the financial crisis and the OECD and IMF downgrading their forecasts.
In September the Fed thought it would be hiking one more time this year. The market has already done it for them, approximately twice, through the combination of an 8% fall in equity markets, 20 basis point increase in long rates, and 2% rise in the dollar.
I think the Fed has done a great job with the unemployment rate below 4% and inflation rate below 2%. My latest @WSJopinion argues that the best way to keep doing a great job is to pause on rate hikes at the December meeting. Tweet thread version follows https://t.co/zqdMwvZYeC
@bweb1219 @WSJopinion The same as my argument against adding extra weight to your backpack when hiking through bear infested woods just so you can ditch it and run faster if you come across a bear.		Best prep is a stronger economy and higher inflation, and the later permits larger real rate cuts.

Nominal wages are growing 0.9pp faster than 5 yrs ago. This is the same as the increase in actual inflation.

Overall adjusted for age the employment rate is 1/2 pp higher than it was pre-recession as gains for older workers have outweighed reductions for younger workers--and the prime age population is unchanged. https://t.co/vlaa8ZyjjE
The employment rate for prime age workers (25-54) has been rising steadily since 2011 &amp; in Oct achieved a landmark return to its pre-recession rate.

@FHMonitor This is based on 1.2% of GDP in stimulus in CY 2018. A multiplier of 0.7 gets you 0.8pp higher GDP. If half is from higher productivity/longer hours and half is from employment that gives you 0.4% more jobs or about 50K a month.
I’m not seeing anything bad in this jobs report. Strong hourly wage growth, even stronger weekly wage growth, higher labor force participation, lower broader underemployment, while job growth bounced back from last month and the unemployment rate remained low.
The 213k jobs per month in 2018 (to date) is a marked upshift from the 182K last year.		The combination of tax cuts and spending increases have probably added about 50K jobs per month this year. Fiscal stimulus does work, at least temporarily.
A huge increase in prime age (25-54) employment rates this month, up 0.4pp, bringing the prime age employment rate up to 79.7–exactly what it was in 2007-Q4.		Men’s prime age employment rates down 0.9pp since then offset by women’s up 1.0pp.
The relevant picture from a recent talk, waged are growing about ~0.6pp faster but trend inflation increases eating about half of that. https://t.co/0wsvkEsHkt https://t.co/uuL6cLbwUe
As we wait for the nominal wage growth number that will likely have a 3 handle, remember it is 80% wrong to dismiss it because inflation has risen (that is mostly oil). But 20% wrong to fully accept it at face value (because the rise in inflation is not all oil).

@karlbykarlsmith I understand that. I just don’t know what “slack” means in a traditional Philips curve.		And if your model is that this is the right relationship conditional on a given “inflation regime” then you can’t necessarily read the odds of switching regimes from the data.
@Brad_Setser @MESandbu The debate is not whether the economy would have been better in 2013 if we had done open ended QE2 and more fiscal stimulus from 2010 forwards. Everyone agrees yes.		It is how much worse off are we today because of the mistakes, political constraints, and inevitable fog of war.
Banking regulation has an automatic bias of getting laxer in booms. Congress and now the Fed are making it even laxer when instead they should be following the Dodd-Frank Act and raising counter cyclical capital buffers.

You could draw a horizontal line at some equilibrium structural wage growth concept (ie, productivity measures in consumer dollars plus inflation minus any term for structural inequality). But then you’re actually inferring slack just from wages, not from EPOP.

@EconDerek @realDonaldTrump If they don't raise rates at the November meeting (p=99.9%) no one will think it looks like appeasing Trump or panicking.		The Fed could make Dec and beyond meetings like that too, effectively deciding de novo each time instead of being on a preset course.
@DeanBaker13 @econjared And it follows -0.3% in 2017-Q4 and 0.3% in Q1. If you're right about Q3 then avg productivity growth over the last year was 1.5%. (This is consistent with potential GDP growth of ~1.4%.)		(Also 4 quarters too little to assess productivity trends and 2 is way way too little.)
@FHMonitor I'm not sure that 3 hikes in 2018 vs. 4 hikes in 2018 is a particularly huge debate. But I agree, December has become slightly more up for grabs.		But you're right that the Fed's hikes have still kept policy accommodative and are consistent with strengthening labor markets.

And your monthly reminder that none of this tells you much about the tax cuts for three reasons:		1. Noise in data makes it hard to extract signals.	2. Short-run pickup consistent with global pickup and Keynesian stimulus.	3. Tax cuts would be expected to show up in longer run.
Overall, taking away the noisy oil series, we have seen a small pickup in business fixed investment growth in the last seven quarters. But nothing spectacular. https://t.co/iOat1sy1dH
This means that business fixed investment ex oil/gas was actually slightly better than the headline in Q3 (1.7% instead of the headline 0.8%). https://t.co/vNBbBylz5h
The oil investment boom might be ending.		Oil/gas structures &amp; equipment fell 37% annually in 2015 and 2016 as oil prices fell.		Oil/gas structures rose 55% annually in 2017 and 2018-H1 as oil prices rose.		But in Q3 oil/gas fell at a 12% annual rate as oil prices leveled off.
The growth of core PCE, the key measure for the Fed, was 1.6% in Q3. This follows three quarters in a row above 2%.		Yet another reason why it wasn't crazy to be hiking earlier this year but would hold off on a hike in Q4.

For those keeping score, in order to get headline yr/yr growth of 3.0% this year we would need Q4 to be 3.3%+. I would take the under on that.		In order to get Q4/Q4 growth of 3.0% this year we would need Q4 to 1.9%+. I would take the over on that.
My own preferred de-noised measure is the growth of consumption plus fixed investment, or PDFP or "Final Sales to Private Domestic Purchasers". It grew at 3.1% in Q3, a little below the pace of the previous 6 quarters.
Consumption continued to be strong, growing 4.0%		But the fixed investment fell 0.4%, led by a large fall in structures.
GDP growth of 3.5% in Q3.		Two unusually large special factors went in offsetting directions: an unusual 2.1pp contribution of inventories and 1.8pp subtraction from net exports.
Two distinct issues: 1. Should we be more worried about 2.5 than we were about 1.5. I hope the answer to that is no--a symmetric target.		2. Should we be less worried about 2.5 because we were at 1.5. A good argument for yes but would feel better if it was articulated in advance. https://t.co/RGB41zQA6i
@MortimerleePaul That is a reasonable argument. But might argue the fourth hike for this year was de facto added in part because of soaring markets so this is just undoing that.		Would also emphasize the inflation undersuprise.

Lots of insights and data. And I agree composition explains very little (I swept it into the background in my piece), benefits explain nothing (I omitted it), inflation only explains a little, so Ernie is focusing on and adding to the discussion of the most relevant hypotheses.
I think Ernie errs in being too eclectic. In particular, inequality is rising more slowly now than in the late 1990s and even falling in some dimensions, compounding the mystery not helping to explain it. You see this in Ernie's chart, just compare to the top/bottom decile. https://t.co/WDsGeMdr3l
I addressed the wage puzzle, defined in the same way, for @voxdotcom. I'm a little more focused on one of Ernie's explanations where he is a bit more catholic in his interpretation. https://t.co/sOtBpeCgoJ

@economeager Shakespeare and Cervantes died on the same date but not the same day.
A data dependent Fed that doesn't mindlessly follow the dot plots would not be new. It's what they did from 2014-16.
I would be more alarmed if China was trying too hard to prevent slowing growth via credit expansions, infrastructure spending, depreciation and the like. The fact that they are somewhat (but not completely) restrained on these and allowing growth to moderate is good not bad.
These same factors all suggest that growth will moderate in the future: convergence will become less powerful, future transitions harder than agriculture to industry, and luck is transitory.		If I was forced to guess would say 4.5% to 5.5% annual rate over the next 20 years.
Basic convergence models would predict ~4% growth. That China remains way above that is a testament to a combination of their success in navigating the economic transition and luck.
A few thoughts on why I don't think we should see China's 6.5% growth rate as particularly alarming.		https://t.co/q9fBGtRBws

@davidmwessel Maybe for something like this. But when forecasters project 2.3 percent growth with risks skewed... the defense about modes makes less sense.
One day someone needs to explain to me what “risks skewed” means. Why didn’t GS change from forecasting, say, 5.3 rate hikes to 5.1 rate hikes? Why reaffirm the same number with different risks?

@MichaelRStrain It is less in 2020 and thereafter but still costly (so subtracts from growth rates in 2020 but still adds to deficit). And the cost even higher if the expiring provisions are made permanent.		Is not like Bush 2008 or Obama 2009.
@MichaelRStrain I would add:		3) The fiscal stimulus is even bigger in 2019. So it’s not that you have to believe in slack now, you need to think slack a year from now too. And monetary policy won’t react.		4) This is a permanent fiscal stimulus in response to a temporary (non) problem.

@GlobeHorowitz I was so distracted by responding to you that somehow the Astros managed to score a run.
@GlobeHorowitz I would not be too focused on the forms of the capital flows (FDI vs. other) but the total magnitude--and that is likely to rise. And would think of those more as investment minus savings and not a micro story about corporate profits etc.
@GlobeHorowitz To the degree it boosts investment above and beyond pure aggregate demand effect (which is possible in theory but relatively small in the case of this actual bill) that would increase capital inflows more and boost the dollar more.
@GlobeHorowitz The arguments for tax cuts (and spending increases) boosting the dollar is a purely aggregate demand/macro story, does not rely on changes in profits/FDI/investment flows. Is higher AD, higher interest rates, more capital inflows, stronger dollar.		Same macro as a SNAP increase.

@sam_a_bell @arindube This is interesting but still would want more evidence.		Also if we believe in Democratic accountability should we be clearer that the arguments for a 4% inflation target are: (1) Allows govt to confiscate savings more easily and (2) helps facilitate larger real wage reductions?
@sam_a_bell @arindube I understand "democratic accountability" is more than a poll and that monetary policy is more than an average inflation rate. But public attitudes towards inflation re one key, knowable input. And if you have empirical evidence on the broader questions interested in those too.
@sam_a_bell @arindube Many/most people's mental model seems nominal wage growth unrelated to the inflation rate. So higher inflation is bad.		I'm not familiar with the evidence so if you know would be interested. Pew consistently finds very negative inflation attitudes. 		https://t.co/gyAxxUD8s0
@sam_a_bell @arindube Do you have any idea what a more public/democratic goal would look like, specifically for average inflation rate? If I had to bet, I would say lower than 2% rather than higher.

@jc_econ @AngelUbide @sam_a_bell @PIIE @ModeledBehavior @business_econ Would just look at the wage growth by quintile in the slides that started this chain.
@jc_econ @AngelUbide @sam_a_bell @PIIE @ModeledBehavior @business_econ You're looking at macro data and I'm more focused on micro data. Much of the late 1990s increase in labor share was higher pay for CEOs and workers at the top. The bottom third is actually seeing faster wage growth now than in the late 1990s, even with lower productivity growth.
Well that was a fitting ending to what has been a catcher vs. catcher series so far.		See you in New York.
@jc_econ @sam_a_bell @PIIE @ModeledBehavior @business_econ As a policy matter, we may have more of a dial to turn on slack than on productivity growth. But that is different than the question of whether ~3% nominal wage growth is surprising. Given productivity growth of 1% it is not.
@jc_econ @sam_a_bell @PIIE @ModeledBehavior @business_econ More to the point, an important lesson of the late 1990s was the role of very fast productivity leading to wage growth--even despite inequality increasing more than it is now and the "hot" labor market underperforming more than it is now (relative to productivity).
@jc_econ @sam_a_bell @PIIE @ModeledBehavior @business_econ I'm not worried about overheating based on wage data either given how high the profit share is and the tenuous link between wage inflation and price inflation.		But your point also suggests the wage puzzle should have been an even bigger issue in the late 1990s than it is now.
@peltast @sam_a_bell @delong @PIIE @ModeledBehavior Market power is very important &amp; I've written about it many times before.		But it doesn't explain the "wage puzzle" for two reasons.

@ChuckLane1 A big part was work sharing: they reduced hours for everyone by 10% rather than firing 10% of workers. A lot due to institutions we can't replicate like works councils. But some we can, like more extensive adoption of UI not just for unemployment but involuntary hours reductions.

Finally, agree that a more robust safety net before the next recession would solve a lot of economic &amp; political problems. But we may not get it so should be ready to use triggers in responding. Eg, everyone gets a quarterly check for $1,000 until unemployment below 6.5%.
So now you have three issues to solve for that are sometimes orthogonal: (1) economic effectiveness; (2) passing Congress; and (3) long-term legitimacy. We did a lot on 1 and 2, makes it harder to also solve for 3 at the same time.
And that is one of dozens of changes made to thread the needle through different committees/chambers. You could say that a big, bold proposal would cut through that. But I can't think of many examples of Congress functioning that way.
Then there is the fact that a lot of politics went into it, but it was all Congressional committee/powerful Senator politics. For example, when we broached one-time payments to Senators they balked, said the 2008 checks were mocked, and wanted to do through reduced withholding.
Of course with the unemployment rising to nearly 10 percent before almost any of it went into effect it was likely to be a negative reaction no matter what we did. And nothing Obama could have done would have prevented that.
Of course it didn't work out that way. For example, a friend of mine told me that his nanny thanked him in April 2009 for giving her a raise. But he didn't give her a raise: he just adjusted her withholding to reflect the Recovery Act tax cut. But she had no idea about that.

@BrendanWoodbury @BrookingsEcon Straight out of the CBO data. I agree, was very surprised. But separate analysis showed little increase in poverty over this period (taking transfers into account, a big increase without them).
@FHMonitor The aggregate evidence from 2002-03 accelerated depreciation was weak but we thought the bang-for-the-buck high from an easy-to-administer interest free loan by a govt that was paying very low interest itself. Zwick &amp; Mahon found that was indeed the case. https://t.co/RZ0WEjrEX4

@tyillc Is both, as I said clearly in the full paper and in the tweet short handed with “partly due to stimulus” because no space to say existing automatic stabilizers played a big role.
@FHMonitor I agree &amp; think we overworried re timing, although mostly without consequences (eg, we did high-speed rail).		A bigger issue is some measures pulled demand forward (eg cash for clunkers). In retrospect not what was needed. But in any downturn hard to say no to extra demand today.

Finally, Germany’s very different experience provides an important lesson for us. They had similar GDP losses but without anything like the unemployment increase we had. In part due to non-replicable institutions, but policy can do more to not just increase GDP but also jobs/GDP. https://t.co/bkt1XQBmQw
I hate to fact check my former boss who said he learned that “there’s no such thing as shovel-ready projects,” but the actual spendout of highway construction funds actually outpaced expectations. Although still not nearly as speedy as tax credits, nutrition assistance, UI, etc. https://t.co/j0N4lWNNqv
The Recovery Act included $300.6 billion of investment, with the largest single item being clean energy. Subsequently Obama proposed more infrastructure, energy, etc., but almost all of the additional stimulus was in the form of tax cuts and UI extensions. https://t.co/v2B1qIhwAD
This chart may change the way you think about the recovery—shows 2007-10 income using CBO data. Pre-tax incomes hit for all (slightly more at the bottom and the top). But post-tax income went up at the bottom and was protected from downturn in the middle. Partly due to stimulus. https://t.co/ISRFUeE6om
The unemployment rate increased by over 4 p.p. but increased by much more for people with a HS degree or less as well as for blacks and Hispanics. https://t.co/LWXZ0k13XA
Similar methodology shows the impact of the full $1.5T 2008-12 stimulus was a maximum increase in GDP LEVEL of 3.4 percent, equivalent to 3 million jobs. In total 10 million job-years over the 5-year period. Note GROWTH of GDP lower after 2011 as stimulus withdrawn. https://t.co/Z1KqQz8Run
Best estimates of the maximum impact of the Recovery Act by forecasters were reasonably similar, ranging from a minimum estimate of 2.0 percent to a maximum impact of 3.4 percent—with CBO’s lower and upper bounds outside these ranges https://t.co/qUkmfrXWQR
CEA, CBO and others used relatively similar multipliers to assess the impact of the stimulus. These multipliers were based on studies prior to the Recovery Act. Research since then suggests that maybe the tax ones, especially for certain business tax cuts, should be larger. https://t.co/5NFoSlNQyO
In total the stimulus was more than half tax cuts, 19% aid to impacted individuals like SNAP and UI, 11% state fiscal relief and 16% public investment. Almost all of that public investment was in the Recovery Act—almost none was passed after that date. https://t.co/NiiSEJn6qw
The discretionary fiscal stimulus averaged 2.0 percent of GDP over those five years and together with automatic stabilizers it was 3.4 percent of GDP. It peaked in 2010 and began to be reduced, prematurely as Congress failed to pass further Obama stimulus proposals. https://t.co/6Cl2UaxaaM

@ShmaitlinShmobe @RadioBoston @amazon @Walmart I am sorry I phrased that poorly, my fault.		Let me try again: a store is hiring someone to work the cash registers. IF we passed a law taxing them for hiring a SNAP (aka food stamps) recipient this would make them less likely to hire a single mother than a childless man.

@greg_ip @sam_a_bell @furman @kearney_melissa @ojblanchard1 Last point: higher employment rates definitely mean higher employment rates (perfect correlation!). That is a good thing. So even if we were unsure about the impact of tighter labor markets on real wage growth, I would still support them for the sake of tighter labor markets.
@greg_ip @sam_a_bell @furman @kearney_melissa @ojblanchard1 I have done a bunch on this and was planning to write it up at some point, probably won't be for a while, and it provided me with some reassurance that a tighter economy raised nominal wage growth more than nominal price growth. But only some, would love to see more on this.
@greg_ip @sam_a_bell @furman @kearney_melissa @ojblanchard1 That is a really important and under-asked question. The unquestioned assumption on econ twitter seems to be that slack affects wage inflation more than price inflation (i.e., a countercyclical markup). But when I asked various macroeconomists I got much more ambiguous responses.
@aaron_hedlund @pdacosta I have stressed slow productivity growth in the puzzle of nominal wage growth not faster than the late 90s.		Another puzzle is real wage growth not faster than 2-3 yrs ago.

@arindube @paulkrugman @Alan_Krueger "Rule-of-thumb for markups over cost" is another way of saying the markup is acyclical.

@arindube Another very speculative hypothesis: the upward nominal wage rigidity stressed by @paulkrugman, @Alan_Krueger and others could mean that a tightening economy results in more increased price growth than wage growth and thus lower real wage growth.
@arindube One speculative hypothesis is that businesses have been continually updated their beliefs about productivity growth down. So the redistribution you refer to is being offset by a falling trend productivity growth.

Note I'm not using actual inflation which has been moved around by oil prices which are moved by many forces in addition to US macro policy. Different measures of the underlying inflation trend tell different stories, but on average they are all rising.
The tightening economy is raising nominal wage &amp; price growth by about the same amount so real wage growth ~unchanged.

The hawks are writing pieces about signs of strained capacity and overheating and financial excesses. But they also conclude with just about the same endorsement of ~4 rate hikes a year.

The pace of job growth seems to falling back from its recent highs towards something a bit below 200K (judging from the 6-month average).		This pace still reflects above-trend growth, much/all due to the 1.2% of GDP fiscal stimulus this year. https://t.co/kK6M1zKAkr
@EAhunbay No, we'll get inflation later this month but it will be around 2.5% (depending on which measure/concept you use). So low real wage growth.
@econ_rob I would not assert they die of old age. But job growth rates asymptote towards something like steady state. I would not expect the unemployment rate to fall (or employment rate to rise) as quickly in year 10 than it did in year 5.
But the broadest measure of labor underutlization, U-6 which includes discouraged workers and involuntary part timers, fell from 7.5% to 7.4%.
Prime age employment rates in August:		Overall: 79.3% (was 79.7% in 2007-Q4)	Men: 86.0% (was 87.1%)	Women: 72.8% (was 72.4%)
Some mismatch between the continued strong jobs numbers (from the employer survey) and the fact that the employment rate has been flat at ~60.3% since February. Partly but not fully explained by aging workforce putting downward pressure on the employment rate.
With downward revisions to jobs in June/July the pace of job growth is a little slower than we had thought. But still remarkable that it is faster than in previous years--when normally it should be slowing at this stage of the cycle.
Best news in jobs report: Wages up 2.9% in last year		Most normal news in jobs report: 201K jobs in past month, almost exactly the same as the 196K average for the last 12 months		Most disappointing news in the jobs report: labor force participation down 0.2pp.

@MESandbu @econjared Here's the picture for Production and Nonsupervisory Workers (would look worse for lower wage workers).		To reiterate, no one who knows what they're doing would use actual CPI.

@JPYaru I find it plausible that flexibility is increasing although anecdotal evidence also says it is decreasing in some dimensions (like zero hours contracts and inflexible scheduling software). Most of this not captured in comp data. My guess is either way not a large difference.
@SBenzell Yes, something I've written about many times before. So arguably could discount health benefits accordingly. Or think of comp as a sort of after-tax equalized measure of the different components of comp.

@econjared @MESandbu I agree on those points (so “Yep—and”). Was just addressing @MESandbu question on comparisons to early 1970s.
@MESandbu @econjared You can use CPI-U-RS for that purpose, does tell a different story than PCE but not as dramatically different as the invalid CPI would.		But having Jensen’s inequality measurement error / upper level substitution bias compound for decades is not easily defended either.
@MESandbu @econjared Using CPI further back is indefensible since it is a methodologically inconsistent series because BLS does update its methodology but does not update CPI (at least the nsa series).

I left out many things! Thread was too long already, but I agree with this. 		I was arguing that conceptually should include benefits. I also pointed out that none of the CEA adjustments changed the overall story. And this is an important part of the reason why they don't. https://t.co/D6qXWTbG7G
@econjared If you didn't write in full paragraphs you would be faster.
I sort of thought this thread was going to blow up twitter. But for some reason something else seems to be of more interest to people.		Would it have been more interesting if my tweetstorm had been anonymous? https://t.co/xSXxLrCi60
Oh, and here is my explanation for slow wage growth. END THREAD https://t.co/sOtBpeCgoJ
IN CONCLUSION, most of CEA's points are not new but many of them are under-appreciated so good to call attn to them. But they don't change our understanding of wage growth in the economy (beyond rebutting silly statements you sometimes hear about no wage growth since the 70s).
And it would be nice if CEA did not just make these adjustments in talking about the economy since January 2017 but applied them earlier. I’m thinking about the opening of this report, for example, which did not make these adjustments. https://t.co/ZByCLODRe6
Also, all data is noisy so best to combine multiple data sources. The Goldman Sachs wage tracker and Jared Bernstein wage tracker, for example, use principal components to form a statistically-based weighted average of different series to exclude noise. https://t.co/8NxOZZPZXA https://t.co/4wL9XW8UGR
FINALLY, CEA does not address the issues of tradeoffs and noise in data. Sometimes we look at more timely data (like AHE) even though it is not perfect, in part because we think the imperfections don’t change the story.
In addition, you need to take into account how the tax cuts were distributed (more of them were for the top) and how they will be repaid. People get more money but also are on the hook for repaying more public debt.
In 2014, for example, the ACA subsidies and Medicaid expansion increased after-tax incomes broadly construed. But it would have been silly to add the subsidies to wages and describe it as wage growth.
FOURTH, CEA GOES WRONG IN ADJUSTING FOR TAXES. It is reasonable to look at INCOMES before and after taxes. But highly unusual to apply this to wages. Wages are meant to be a measure of labor market outcomes not an overall indicator of well-being.
None of these inflation measures fully account for quality improvements so all probably show too much inflation and too little real wage growth. This bias is likely lower today than in the past.  https://t.co/7PqWhvOq2J
Probably the ideal would be to use the chained CPI which corrects for substitution bias but has the correct basket. This would put real wage growth between the CPI version that is often reported and the PCE version CEA prefers.
The advantage of the CPI is that it uses a market basket that more closely approximates what consumers are buying with their wages. (The PCE also includes what is purchased by Medicare, nonprofits and the like).
THIRD, INFLATION ADJUSTMENT. Most economists use the CPI but I agree with CEA that there is a case for using another inflation measure, the PCE price index, which I sometimes use myself. The PCE price index is chain-weighted so it does not suffer from substitution bias.
As an aside, much of the progressive advocacy for mandated or publicly provided benefits like sick leave implicitly assumes that these are worth more to workers than the equivalent amount of cash.
You could debate whether workers value benefits as much as they value wages. But absent certain tax distortions, unless companies are making systematic errors they are probably not giving workers stuff that costs the companies more than the benefits to the workers.
SECOND, INCLUDING BENEFITS. CEA is correct that it is, in theory, desirable to include benefits like health insurance, bonuses, paid leave, and the like. The ECI includes these while the standard Average Hourly Earnings measure does not.
CEA finds that adjusting for this composition effect adds 0.3 pp to the annual growth rate. But sometimes it changes the pattern. For example, in 2009 and 2010 reported wage growth was artificially boosted when low-wage workers were fired and now the reverse is happening.
This is correct and why it is worth looking at the Atlanta Wage tracker which addresses this issue. https://t.co/zKiTHkjCUW
FIRST, COMPOSITION EFFECTS. Headline wage growth measure suffers from a composition effect that artificially reduces wage growth as younger, lower-paid workers enter and aging affects the share of the workforce in peak earning years.
CEA focuses on four changes all of which raise the rate of real wage growth in the present but also raise it by a similar amount in the past and leave the overall pattern unchanged. Let me discuss them in turn.
CEA has released a "primer" on wage measurement. Much of the substance is reasonable (with one exception noted below). But it does almost nothing to change our understanding of wage growth. THREAD https://t.co/LR9T2k5vOL

@RenMacLLC Agree, but whatever you thought about the economy at 8:29am you should revise it down slightly.
Overall the GDP revision should lead us to revise down our views about the strength of the economy. But within expenditures, the composition improved somewhat with less consumption growth and even more investment growth. (But would feel better if these #s added up properly.)
Keeping track of all of this is a bit of a headache. And an unnecessary one: BEA should report these averaged numbers as their headline, as the UK, Canada and others do. As I wrote previously, would have shown faster growth in Q1 but slower in Q4/Q2. https://t.co/2YQEHL1VdI
Over the past four quarters the average of GDP/GDI (also known as GDO) is up 2.5%, a bit lower than the 2.9% pace of headline GDP.
It appears that the economy in Q2 wasn't quite as strong as it looks after all. While the headline GDP growth was revised up to 4.2%, the growth of GDI was 1.8% (an alternative measure). Averaging says the best guess was 3.0% growth last quarter.

Beyond the immediate decision about whether to raise the countercyclical buffer, it would be good to have broader thinking on when to use macroprudential tools and how to give the Fed even more tools to deal with the financial sector. END THREAD
The Fed will be deciding this fall. They act in a technocratic expert manner in monetary policy (which doesn’t mean they are always right) but can be overly influenced by the banking industry on the regulatory side. So a broader public debate on this issue would be welcome.
This debate has not gotten much attention but several contributions including Brainard and Rosengren on the pro side, Liang on the not yet side, and Cochrane on the no side. https://t.co/UvR2Eshbpo https://t.co/PR763nxCtS  https://t.co/mQM35XvQN4 https://t.co/njc28lpBxd
As an aside, the biggest downside of higher capital requirements in general—or even temporarily higher ones in booms—is shifting more financial activity to the less regulated shadow banking sector. Ideally would toughen regulation/supervision there as well.
Personally I believe the cost-benefit justifies higher capital standards more generally but whatever your view about them generally could still support higher in good times and lower in bad times. https://t.co/fZxiMCNKha
I outline the benefits of this approach in the oped: (1) reduce financial froth now; (2) give us a tool to lower capital requirements in the next downturn; and (3) make this tool more predictable by establishing a more predictable cadence for altering capital buffers.
Even the Fed’s narrower approach justifies an increase given valuations &amp; other financial froth (a bigger concern than inflation right now). But am concerned that this narrower approach will miss most financial problems, as it has in the past. Better to rely on the macro data.
The Fed instead defines the test for raising the countercyclical capital buffer more narrowly as “during periods of rising vulnerabilities in the financial system.” They rely in a wide set of indicators. https://t.co/H1s8iqYHWW
The US, however, has not acted and instead has kept the countercyclical capital buffer at zero. This contradicts a plain English reading of Dodd-Frank: we have had a lot of twitter debate about slack but I don’t think anyone would argue this is not a “time of economic expansion.”
Basel III also endorsed countercyclical capital buffers in Dec 2010. They have since been used by the UK, France, 8 other European countries, &amp; other economies around the world. (As an aside, most of these have other macroprudential tools as well.) https://t.co/wnq7JaRElw
Dodd-Frank says that the Fed should make banks hold extra capital in “times of economic expansion" &amp; relax the requirement in the opposite case. https://t.co/VJV341WlUO
Both of these are an argument for "macroprudential" regulation that takes the macroeconomic context/impact of regulation into account. https://t.co/nyb4dXAQDy
More background: bank regulators traditionally focused on safety and soundness of individual banks. But the way you regulate an individual bank also affects the macroeconomy and other banks, a spillover that was not taken into account.
Background: the Fed effectively has three goals (maximum employment, price stability, and financial stability). And it mostly operates by varying one instrument with economic conditions (the interest rate). Hard to hit three goals with one instrument absent divine coincidence.
My conclusion: “Asking banks to lay more capital aside while the sun is still shining would strengthen their ability to withstand the next rainy day. It would lessen the risk of future bailouts. And... reduce the chances of another crisis in the first place.”

Not every one of these ideas are ready for primetime. All will have to contend with fiscal constraints. But they are precisely what we should be debating about how to solve one of our fundamental economic challenges. Not punishing people while doing little to encourage work.
Progressives are having the right conversation--which is to focus on what we can do to create/support/enable jobs. This includes guaranteed public jobs, subsidized private jobs, EITC, training/job placement assistance, paid leave, childcare.
What are the upsides in terms or increased work? Very little according to the Natl Evaluation of Welfare to Work: no persistent employment gains, deep poverty up, higher wages did not make up for lost benefits. See @dolanecon  https://t.co/tobqdbIZuR
Kentucky's Medicaid plan (stayed by court) requires 80hrs/mo. Let's say you work 1,000 hrs/yr (or more than 80hrs/mo on average) but cycle in and out of jobs involuntarily-something that happens a lot. You could lose your Medicaid. See @AvivaAronDine et al https://t.co/rahB0qGvTy
Under the House plan, an able-bodied adult who spends a single month without working 20 hours a week would lose SNAP benefits for a year. For a second offense, the penalty is three years.

@BrendanWoodbury Was a shorthand. If you look at wage trackers that efficiently combine multiple indicators to reduce uncorrelated measurement errors (e.g., Goldman Sachs and Jared Bernstein) you see some increase in the pace of wage growth in recent years.		Both AHE and ECI have info.
@karlbykarlsmith I could argue 2007-Q4 either way, but in general some inflation increase then so did not appear to be much slack then.		I hope more room for EPOP. But for a large increase need structural policies too.		My breakdown of the intl comparison: https://t.co/SlcUEkovUz
I recently wrote about a different wage puzzle--why are nominal wages growing more slowly now than in the late 1990s--and found it was more than explained by the slower inflation now and the much slower productivity now. https://t.co/sOtBpeTRgh
Wages up 2.7% for the last 12 months (both private and PNS). Roughly the same pace for the last two years. That is another wage puzzle and one I don't have the answer to.		(Answer is not PA EPOP because that is down a lot. Answer may be mismeasurement because ECI up a lot.)
For all of you prime age employment population rate followers, it is now up to 79.5%. That is just 0.2pp below its 2007-Q4 value (and only 0.1pp below adjusted for aging which does affect this group a little).		Reflects -0.9pp for men and +0.5pp for women since the peak.

Thanks for the discussion on this and look forward to more. But maybe not any more today.
Finally, I agree the Fed should look at changing its inflation target and have been public about that https://t.co/7cw1Mga0xb. But I would much rather they pre-announce it in a credible manner than just back into it. Surprise inflations can be bad for real wages.
I agree with all the arguments for easing but a FFR of 2 or 2.5 would still be expansionary. And given lags in policy and uncertainty buying a modicum of insurance against overheating seems prudent. The UR has a nasty habit of rising a lot when it starts rising a little.
Third, I’m not sure if we differ on monetary policy or not. I think the Fed should keep its foot on the accelerator until we see more inflation—but can apply less pressure than it has in the past. In other words, gradual rate hikes are correct. (I believe @econjared agrees.)
This behavior is consistent with anchored expectations. Moreover, in explaining inflation narrower measures of slack (like short-term unemployment) often do better than broader measures (like EPOP).
A secondary issue is the degree to which excess slack explains low inflation. My problem with this is that 7 years ago the puzzle was why is inflation so high even with lots of slack. So is more a flattening of the Phillips curve than a shift down.
And remember, median real wages are only growing ~0.5pp slower than in the late 1990s. That is partly because businesses expected some mean reversion in both cases. I agree that productivity is likely to pick up, but getting near 3.0% is not something any is/should count on.
Productivity growth in the late 1990s period I examine was 3.0% and was 0.7% in the last three years. Moreover, both of those were well into an expansion with relatively tight labor markets (we could argue about which was tighter). This is more than cyclical.
Cycles can affect productivity (as I have written about before &amp; note in the piece). But I would not overstate it. Productivity picked up in 1995 when still lots of slack. It slowed ~2004 pre-Great Recession. Is weaker in UK &amp; other economies with larger EPOP increases. Etc.
The most fundamental issue @joshbivens_DC raises is that I largely treat slow productivity growth as exogenous whereas he argues it is a function of slack.

Also secular stagnation, as I define it, is primarily about much lower than expected real interest rates. That has not changed.
I agree with this, was sort of implicit in the discussion of the trend rise in inequality. But it is not a solution to the puzzle because, on net, all of these forces not larger than they have been for the last 40 years so doesn't explain the surprise of lower wage growth. https://t.co/S1zCTRk7dd

@jodiecongirl No tax issues should be thought of through tax policy aesthetic lenses, unless you’re debating different ways to raise the same amount of revenue.		Even if this was good aesthetics, is it a good use of $100b???		(End of rant, don’t want to discourage out of the bubble thinking.)
@jodiecongirl Unrelated point: the lower capital gains rate arguably reflects rough justice for non indexation. And waiting until realization to tax (or never at death) massively lowers cap gains rate.
@jodiecongirl In an ideal tax system you would index ALL aspects of capital taxation (although some tradeoff against simplicity).		If you index one side borrow $100, pay 4% interest, invest at 5% nominal return, 2% inflation. Then you deduct a tax loss of 1% (3% real return - 4% interest).
@jodiecongirl Rethink: deducting nominal interest used to fund your real gains is not good tax policy.

@ModeledBehavior @sam_a_bell @joshbivens_DC @eliselgould @hshierholz The 3.0 and 0.7 in the article are NFB. But I've looked at many different measures.
@LarryMishel @joshbivens_DC That's mostly because workers at the top were doing much better in the late 1990s than they are now. And is a perfect illustration of why it is better to look directly at wages rather than at labor shares--which as you know include CEO pay.
@karlbykarlsmith @voxdotcom What evidence do you have for this? Atlanta Fed wage tracker doesn't march down the MPL but shows similar behavior to AHE. Are you looking at something else to argue this is quantitatively important?
@ModeledBehavior @sam_a_bell @joshbivens_DC @eliselgould @hshierholz Productivity tracks average wages if you use the same deflator for the two.		Productivity does not track median wages because average wages have risen more than median wages, aka inequality. But that 2nd factor is not bigger now than before, in fact somewhat smaller than before.
I think you have done excellent work on the decomposition. I think much of that work is lost by people citing it.		I also think your work gets at part of the wage slowdown but is missing the most important factor in the last several years--which is slow productivity growth. https://t.co/i1QSJmPFmR
@swinshi Does this mean you agree with the policy recommendations? 90-10 inequality has been reduced, in part, by states raising minimum wages. I am suggesting more of that, not saying everything fine no need to do more.
I address the real reason you're not getting a pay raise in @voxdotcom: slow productivity growth and trend inflation.		Fortunately for workers at the bottom, inequality is falling in SOME dimensions. But need to do a lot more to keep that up.		https://t.co/sOtBpeCgoJ

@sam_a_bell @joshbivens_DC @eliselgould @hshierholz But I think it can create the wrong impression for people when you show mean productivity deflated by economywide prices against median wages deflated by consumer prices.		(Plus when people don't draw that chart in logs you don't notice the large productivity slowdown.)

Just a reminder: GDP growth very volatile. Over the past four quarters is up 2.8%. That is faster than the previous pace but there were also four times between 2009:Q1 and 2017:Q1 (aka the Obama administration) that four quarter growth exceeded this pace.
It turns out the personal savings rate is pretty high and stable. Will cross that off my worry list. This is a big upward revision from before (I don't have an earlier graph but was revised up from 3.4% to 6.7% in 2017). https://t.co/gBOZ4ct8gn
More from today's GDP release: The pretty good 7.3% increase in business fixed investment (BFI) was almost all oil/mining. Outside of that it was only up 3.8%. So far this year, however, pace of BFI ex oil/gas up a bit from previous years. https://t.co/UO5AdlVkeu
Consumption a very strong 4.0%. Business fixed investment softened a bit but still strong at 7.3%.		Q1 also revised up to 2.2% and GDO up to 3.1%.

@StambaughRyan Yes. GDP &amp; GDI are two ways to measure the identical concept. Timing shifts should show up in both of them.		The other concept, sometimes called PDFP, is an attempt to strip out noisy non-persistent items (even if correct for that Q) and focus on the more persistent signal.
@StambaughRyan Macroeconomic Advisers has net exports making a 1.3pp contribution to Q2 growth, half of that could be a timing shift.		This makes it even more important than usual to focus on the growth of private domestic domestic demand (C + I excluding inventories). MA has this at 3.3%.

@swinshi @Noahpinion I’m interested in 2000 to the present, the period largely identified the broadly held academic view on this issue (e.g., one of my bigger disagreements with Barro when we co-wrote our paper was that he believed a much larger/more persistent fall in the labor share than I did).
@Econ_Marshall @rortybomb @ernietedeschi @samh510 @Noahpinion @sjwrenlewis And I’ll give the last word (or at least my last word) on this topic to Thomas Palley: https://t.co/a2l4THCSgI
@rortybomb @ernietedeschi @Econ_Marshall @samh510 @Noahpinion There were issues with our policy. There were also constraints. And there were also some real successes. Might discuss that another time.
@rortybomb @ernietedeschi @Econ_Marshall @samh510 @Noahpinion Just read the IMF’s Article IV reviews of US fiscal policy from 2010 through about 2015, they all advocated for more fiscal expansion—and criticized the United States for too rapid a fiscal consolidation. Again, didn’t need MMT for that.
@rortybomb @ernietedeschi @Econ_Marshall @samh510 @Noahpinion I don’t understand what this has to do with MMT. Major research on hysterisis was done by Blanchard-Summers. Larry used it to argue (internally &amp; then in BPEA) that we needed more stimulus &amp; that it would reduce debt/GDP for this reason. Christy was not an MMTer, nor was Krugman.
Thank you. We have a revenue problem. If I thought we could just print money to deal with it I would not have been nearly as bothered by the Bush or Trump tax cuts. https://t.co/ismHedd28T
@maxbsawicky How is that different than Mankiw’s textbook?
@Noahpinion @swinshi I should add, I don’t think the labor share is super exciting or important compared to the distn of wages and the distn of capital income. So this debate is a bit of a sideshow.		My discussion of Autor et al covered this point: https://t.co/DgRsKGcDNX
You’re being overly kind to MMT (consistent with your generally errring on the side of decency). Feels like the “what’s new is wrong and what’s right is not new” would apply. But open(ish) to seeing examples otherwise. https://t.co/5HmiKLSkGH
@Noahpinion @swinshi @swinshi what is the academic argument against https://t.co/JuGHTYKvzN		(Also you get Summers wrong. Stansbury-Summers finds factors that affect the labor share are orthogonal to factors that affect productivity, not that there have been no factors affecting the labor share.)
@rortybomb @hyperplanes @ernietedeschi @jodiecongirl @soashworth A reading of that paper was very influential with some policymakers. But that was not a particularly academic paper and was not very influential with macro researchers.		&amp; the IMF was a big critic of the austerity literature (more Alesina-Ardagna in their case) without any MMT.

@rortybomb @hyperplanes @ernietedeschi @jodiecongirl @soashworth To the degree we got the fiscal balance wrong it wasn’t because macroeconomics was wrong and we needed a new theory like MMT but that we needed to follow textbook macro more than we did.
@rortybomb @hyperplanes @ernietedeschi @jodiecongirl @soashworth There is a large academic literature on deficits and interest rates. Little of it had crisis in it and I don’t think it got anything particularly wrong.		There are also macro identities so higher deficits today mean less investment, less consumption, or less GNP in future.
@ModeledBehavior @AlanMCole @Noahpinion The case against what? A Social Wealth Fund? @Noahpinion is the only one I have seen advocating it. And I wouldn’t want to argue too much with him because he’s usually right and he has much more ink than I do.
@rortybomb @ernietedeschi @jodiecongirl @soashworth Fiscal crises are a dumb argument for deficit reduction.		Termites in the woodwork a better one.		But we have a lot of problems so need to compare the seriousness of those to the termites.
@AlanMCole @Noahpinion We could have all the automatic stabilizers we want with or without this proposal.		Moreover, as Peters Diamond and Orszag pointed out, the government can get more exposure to risks/higher returns by taxing capital more.
@Noahpinion So you like the leverage.		If you don’t believe there is an equity premium then this free lunch doesn’t work.		If you do believe in it, why not fund government more broadly this way?		I fell out of love with the Clinton proposal to invest the SS TF in equities a while ago.
Could encourage a new equilibrium by encouraging Rs to raise taxes. That step in 1990 gave Ds the courage to do deficit reduction. 2001, 2003, 2017 shattered it.		This is not just politics, but economics in a repeated game with one player that puts revenue reductions above all.
I would like to live in the world @IlliniBizDean describes but I suspect we are in the world @soashworth describes.		If D deficit reduction just leads to larger R tax cuts then Ds can’t reduce the deficit—they can just pay in advance for tax cuts. https://t.co/TQ7GHgHuvl
@Noahpinion How is this different from running large surpluses now to reduce the debt/GDP ratio?		Or are you envisioning leverage for govt, in which case why not do that to fund regular govt too?		Why raise a lot of money to spend on people/projects in the future when so much need today?

@cocoaheath No magic number but generally when the labor share goes down inequality goes up. This is because capital income is distributed more unequally than labor income.		Note “generally”. Labor share could go down because CEO pay goes down in which case it would mean lower inequality.
@LarryMishel I would not ignore the labor share, just would have it third on the list I was trying to explain.		Also your chart is yet more evidence that no one theory explains all types of inequality at all times. It doesn’t disprove that increased concentration is one factor now.
People a little too fixated on the labor share. Inequality increased a lot faster from 1980-2000 when the labor share was constant than it has since 2000 when the labor share had been falling.		The distn of wages matters much more, as does the distn of capital income.

7. A broader lesson: when you're reading try to figure out if it is new data/analysis, a new interpretation, or something already known. And also try to see how it fits into the broader debates/issues. Try to avoid being overly excited by the headlines.
6. As I said above, this has ZERO bearing on what the impact of the law will be on GDP in 2020 or 2025 or 2035, which is what really matters.
5. Moreover, if you look at the new evidence/data since the law passed you do see a genuine pickup in US GDP/job growth that, unlike 2017, is much stronger than in other countries as I discussed here: https://t.co/2cOkOAZjJZ
4. In fact, I would not be surprised if these estimates all understate the SR impact of the tax law. I place non-zero weight on a series of papers not included in the SF Fed survey (Romer and Romer, Mertens and Ravn, Barro and Redlick, Zidar) that find much larger SR effects.
3. The median estimate of the tax law surveyed by CBO was 0.35pp in 2018. This is consistent with the SF Fed literature review &amp; a far from the straw man they criticized: "a number of macroeconomic forecasters expect the TCJA to boost 2018 GDP growth by around a percentage point" https://t.co/XdyR3V2eDn
2. The research note is a literature review. It is not any new evidence or data about the macro impact of the tax law, just the observation that expansionary fiscal policy works less well when the economy is closer to full employment. That was factored into most analysis already.
1. The research note is only about the short-run, Keynesian impact of the law. This could be zero and you could still have large long-term growth effects from capital accumulation. Or it could be large with no long-term growth. Is completely unrelated to what matters.
I'm not sure why lots of people got so excited by the SF Fed's literature review on Keynesian multiplier. It has no bearing at all on just about any important debate on the 2017 tax law, for or against. https://t.co/uFblrL3ff8
The result itself seems plausible to me. More importantly is a good reminder that we obsess about the distributional impact of tax policies but almost completely ignore the distributional impact of other policy instruments. Should be more research rectifying that imbalance.
New research finds that efficiency standards are more regressive than carbon/fuel taxes. Intuition is that efficiency standards are like a fixed cost that partially get repaid with more use--and high-income households use it more.		https://t.co/2vt6BtAXQV

Overall, we need more sustained medium- and long-run growth, especially in wages. Nothing in the data so far has any bearing on whether or not that will happen. And based on broader research there is reason to be skeptical that it will. https://t.co/y6I9fD8cBO

Economists have generally emphasized the demand interpretation, which would imply that the growth effect would reverse after a few years. This is why growth forecasts for 2018 were increased but longer-run growth forecasts were kept the same/reduced. https://t.co/VAaEWA3lZx
The question is why. Two interpretations: (1) Demand due to nearly $250b of temporary stimulus from tax cuts and spending increases (which will grow again next year as shown in the chart) and (2) supply due to increased work/investment due to lower tax rates. https://t.co/v5ug5bcDZA

@FHMonitor If we're going to publish GDP, we should publish the best measure of it. And I think we should publish GDP as the broadest measure of the economy.		(I would also argue is more like 1-1/2 months earlier than most understand not 3 months.)
Another way to combine GDP and GDI data from the Philadelphia Fed shows growth rates were 1.7% in 2017-Q4 and 3.1% in 2018-Q1 as compared to the official estimates of 2.8% and 2.0% respectively. https://t.co/kB962JcB5m
This fix would not change the average growth rate but would be more accurate, with potentially larger--and more consequential--gains around turning points, like when the economy is going into recession.
The quick/simple fix would be to feature the average of GDP/GDI in the monthly press release on GDP. Even better would be to integrate them so that the familiar C + I + G + NX adds up to the average of GDP/GDI, something the UK and Canada already do.
A measure that simply averages the two is a nearly optimal way to combine the two. For the last quarter it would have shown 2.8% growth instead of the 2.0% growth reported in the official statistics. (And for 2017-Q4 would have been the reverse).
Right now we measure the economy by adding up spending (GDP) and adding up income (GDI). In theory these are equal, because of measurement error they can differ.
Shorter version of my @wsjopinion arguing that the BEA should shift to featuring more accurate measures of growth. https://t.co/2YQEHL1VdI
@Aintropy @WSJopinion The official data overstated economic performance in 2017-Q4. &amp; President Trump shouldn't have anything to do with how BEA presents these data, it should be a technical/statistical choice--and I'm advocating they change it in line with the best recent research and intl practice.
@HAMISHDAVIDSON1 @tomkeene @WSJopinion No, they don't fiddle their figures. They are constantly making improvements in the very difficult job of accurately measuring the economy. This is the next improvement they should make.
@nels1936 @WSJopinion It would reduce the forecast error variance by a bit more than 0.1pp, so still a lot of variance. Some evidence that the improvements would be larger around turning points, which is when these data are most consequential. https://t.co/1rKKGZCPgm

Given these structural factors, I don’t see much ammunition in the cross-country data to argue that the US has substantial slack based on the fact that other countries have increased employment rates. But these cross-country data are not what I would use to assess this question.
Overall this is a structural story, about the missed opportunities to promote more supportive labor markets for women in the United States (childcare, paid leave, flexibility, etc.) and the continued scope for improving employment rates for older workers in other economies.
The difference for older workers is a story of convergence—employment rates for older workers have risen everywhere, but other countries are moving pension policies closer to US policies and are still catching up to us. https://t.co/jMEoaEpd9z
The differences for women are a story of divergence—the United States has seen stagnant women’s employment rates while the rest of the advanced economies are continuing to make improvements. https://t.co/9oLZtt57hz
The story is similar if you do the comparison to the euro area or to the UK, the big difference being that we outperformed the euro area for prime-age men while the UK outperformed us. https://t.co/8ahuGgnLN9
So the other advanced economies outperformed the United States by 2.5pp. We can compare the role of different age-sex groups in the difference and we find that 77% of it is because of women and 52% is because of older workers (these categories overlap). https://t.co/3lHGJyBbt4
From 2007 to 2017 US EPOP fell 2.9pp while EPOP for other advanced economies was unchanged. In both cases, the aging of the population lowered employment rates. Adjusting for this it only fell 0.4pp in the US while rising 2.1pp in other advanced economies. https://t.co/C2XGLyfAGK

@amitabhchandra2 @TopherSpiro So you agree there was a huge fiscal change due to the ACA, you’re just criticizing people who overemphasize some causes (ACOs etc) and underemphasize others (brute force)? On that I agree and we always emphasized the later in our work: https://t.co/FBaoLTZySi
@amitabhchandra2 You’re saying the Trustees got it wrong? But, if anything, their outlook has improved since then. (Adjusted for window effects the current 0.84 forecast is lower than their 2010 forecast.)
@KDbyProxy @MarcGoldwein Yes. And so are our taxes. OECD could have advocated moving more towards those averages.
@amitabhchandra2 I must be misunderstanding your point. In 2009 Medicare HI had an actuarial imbalance of 3.88% of payroll, the next year it was down to 0.66% of taxable payroll, which effectively all of that due to the ACA. Isn’t that a huge improvement directly due to the ACA? https://t.co/T9tKfoMssy
@MainStEmployers @ScottElliotG @J_W_Rosenberg @jbarro Don’t visit the sins of the fathers on the sons.
@rinsana @LoganMohtashami In the last yrs growth was  ~0.5pp lower per year because of the euro zone crisis/global slowdown (which showed up as a stronger dollar and weaker exports).		Too much fiscal contraction—including sequester—subtracted more. But we did buy back much of the sequester temporarily.
@ernietedeschi Is also a bunch of work--at least until the ILO and OECD start doing more standardization. (E.g., older workers EPOP varies enormously because of data issues, we tried to fix those as much as possible in our data.)
From 2007 to 2017 the US employment rate fell 2.9pp. At the same time EPOP was, on average, flat in the other advanced economies--even though they all have aging populations too.

@lydiadepillis @OECD @greg_ip This is the reason that on GDP day we focus more on percentage point contributions of exports and imports rather than the percentage change in either of them.
(Note, the percentage increase in exports is larger than the percentage increase in imports. But since exports are lower than imports to start the result is a slight widening of the trade deficit.)
@OECD simulation finds a (small) increase in the U.S. trade deficit if all G20 countries dramatically cut/eliminated tariffs.		Shows it is foolish to either blame trade deficits on unfair trade or to judge the impact of trade liberalization by the impact on the trade balance. https://t.co/MHxFa13gJC
@lydiadepillis @OECD @greg_ip And I see I made an error too, my point was correct but should have written:		2.2% increase in exports &lt; 2% increase in imports.
@lydiadepillis @OECD @greg_ip Actually that chart shows that tariff reduction would increase the US trade deficit: 		2% increase in exports &lt; 2.2% increase in imports.		(To be clear, I don't see this as an argument against full trade liberalization--higher exports and higher imports are both good.)
A bit of whiplash to see @OECD expressing concerns about U.S. budget deficits but then calling for even more tax cuts.		I'm a big supporter of extending/expanding expensing, but a minimum condition for even considering it should be that it is paid for with additional tax reforms. https://t.co/Av6DuHYj5d

@glenweyl You cite Syverson on capital misallocation. Is the "monopoly problem" really a major reason why capital is misallocated or an important solution to it? I didn't see you make that case.
@glenweyl Let me limit it to this one: a wealth tax and social dividend is separable from COST. I really didn't see much motivation in your book for COST, beyond making it easier to build the hyperloop. But that does not seem sufficient reason to get excited about this change.
@glenweyl You don't need to be defensive, it is a brilliant book and very glad you did it and it deserves to be widely read.		BUT, I think one also can/should debate the ideas.

@OKnox If you told me productivity growth over the next decade would be 1pp lower then I would revise down my forecast of wage growth by 1pp.		But then actual wage growth would be affected by many factors, including health costs (which BTW have also been growing slowly in recent years).
@OKnox I understand that since the 1970s wages have underperformed productivity growth. But you can't infer from this fact that productivity and wages are unrelated.		Late 1990s had stronger productivity growth than currently and also stronger wage growth than now, for example.
@OKnox Almost all economists agree that productivity is strongly linked to pay, but not the only factor--inequality can be a big plus or minus.		The evidence over longer periods and across countries is hugely compelling.		Also for shorter periods: https://t.co/mS8lWq0oqI

@nielslesniewski Impossible to extract the signal (e.g., tax cuts) from the noise (e.g., everything else).		I would think 4 factors: (1) global strengthening; (2) higher oil prices fuel investment in that sector; (3) Keynesian stimulus from tax cuts and (4) incentives from tax cuts incl expensing
@CausticPop Private Domestic Final Purchases (PDFP). BEA calls it “Final Sales to Domestic Private Purchasers.		Is the growth rate of consumption + investment (excluding inventories). Is a better predictor of next quarter/year’s GDP growth than the headline number.		https://t.co/jeOAe0AKJA
@OKnox (1) Business fixed investment is new purchases of equipment/software/structures/R&amp;D/etc..		(2) More equipment etc. means more productive workers and higher wages.		(3) Investment caused by many factors, most recently rising oil prices, a global rebound, and tax cuts.
Biggest news is the large upward revision for business fixed investment to a strong 9.2%, was 6.1% in the advance release. This is the strongest since 2014.		Consumer spending remains a weak 1.0%, barely revised from 1.1% previously.
Best estimate of growth revised up slightly from 2.3% 1st estimate to 2.5% (using expenditure and income data).		Some due to volatile inventories/NX/govt.		Stripping out these volatile components, the more intertial PDFP grew 2.1%, among the weakest quarters in the several yrs.
Help, BEA seems to be down—at least I can’t get it.
In 2017-Q4 the economy was pretty good.		The headline GDP number was 2.9%. That was boosted 1pp by measurement error (the difference btwn GDP and GDO) and reduced 1.5pp by volatile categories (like inventories and NX).		About to get a much better read on Q1 than the 2.3% advance.

@greg_ip @davidmwessel If I say a coin is fair and you say it is weighted to be 55% of heads, a single toss is not going to change our views much.		The inference problem in the aggregate macro data is even more severe than that one because we don't know ex ante exactly what constitutes heads and tails.
@greg_ip @davidmwessel But, even a reasonable addition to investment would put it at the 55th percentile of the random variation. So we'll never know much of anything by looking at the macro data.
@greg_ip @davidmwessel Causal dates include the election, the various times in 2017 the tax bill moved forward, the retroactive expensing date, the day it passed or the day it went into effect. Would expect it to be quite difficult to do an event study.		And I would expect it to add to investment.

@MatthewPhillips As opposed to Census New Orders for capital goods excluding transportation which is a perfect read on the economy!
@MatthewPhillips I confess that I have always used the standard macro data (census orders, NIPA investment and ISM) not the S&amp;P capex numbers. But that may reflect habit more than conviction.		Regardless, I would expect investment to strengthen.
To be clear: I would expect Keynesian stimulus from tax law this year and the data says nothing about the real cases for/against the tax cuts. But the political arguments arguments for it seem to be finding little support.
Most surprising is how many have been grasping to find evidence of an uptick in investment. Not seeing it in forward-looking measures. (And we should have some, if even only from Keynesian.) If even 10% of repatriated earnings were being invested we would see that in the data. https://t.co/tk6BEEihh7
On wages, theory predicts that the passthrough from corporate tax cuts to wages takes time but many have said it would be much faster. With nominal wage growth not budging and real wage growth down this seems implausible. https://t.co/NSYqCVl5Am
On growth, anything could happen but with 2.3% in Q1 and Q2 tracking around 3%, I would be happy to take the under on 4% growth.
From the data so far, however, several claims seem implausible including growth “easily” reaching 4% in 2018, tax cuts immediately passing through to wages, or businesses investing a lot of their repatriated earnings.
Impossible to infer much about impact of tax law from GDP growth. Even if we knew the impact of the tax law in 2018, the longer-term effect is what matters and it could be larger or smaller.
A lot of people trying to infer the effects of the tax cut from the macro data. Is much harder than trying to infer if a coin is weighted to be 55-45 from just a single toss. I have a bunch on this in my @taxpolicycenter talk today. https://t.co/uAYbhqKDbd
@dashching @gregleiserson But at least it is helping to move price inflation towards the Fed’s 2 percent target!
Understanding the GDP effects of tax laws doesn't require knowing much about where the capital comes from.		Understanding the desirability of those effects does. Matters a lot if they come from reduced consumption or more foreign borrowing.		My talk today: https://t.co/3cFPt1kHm2
@kpomerleau @TaxPolicyCenter @taxfoundation Kotlikoff claims the strength of his model is that unlike every other model it accurately captures the dynamics of capital flows. And it was repeatedly cited by the White House FWIW.
Bottom line: Growth effects of tax law were small, welfare effects probably negative, but a lot of potential for revenue raising reform in the future. END THREAD
Raising top rate to 28%, having full, permanent expensing, and disallowing interest deductions would raise revenue while boosting growth rates by 0.2pp. https://t.co/j2S16zGLor

More importantly, what we really care about is long-run growth. That is also hugely uncertain, will be affected by many policy and non policy factors over the next decade, will be impossible to extract the policy delta from it. https://t.co/NnjdhPo8ag
Trying to infer whether the tax cut worked from investment data is harder than trying to infer whether a coin is rigged and is really 55-45 based on a single toss. https://t.co/01nIIzf2jz
The problem is, a 90 percent interval for actual investment around mean is anywhere from about –11.6% to +9.6%. With that noise impossible to infer anything about a signal that in our wildest, craziest dreams would be something like +5%.
We saw a mild uptick in business fixed investment growth in Q1 excluding oil/gas (all the 2017 increase was just oil/gas). https://t.co/KqYnOUDO4T
Most of the forward-looking measures of investment started increasing in 2016 and, if anything, are flat or down this year. I would not read much into these—but certainly would not read anything positive into these. https://t.co/6otPxCGJ5v
The most important data to focus on is wages, and nominal wages show no change in growth rate at all since the tax cut passed (and inflation has continued to trend up). Again, see @gregleiserson for more on this. https://t.co/w0Lo9n1ouI https://t.co/q6obXA7MyN
More importantly, forecasts for longer-run growth are unchanged or down from the end of 2016 to the present. So professionals don’t expect to see much of a change in growth.
Another way is to look at how forecasters incorporate the tax cut, as well as other changes, into their models. Forecasts have increased substantially for 2018 GDP growth, but that is also true for forecasts for other countries.
TOPIC 4: HOW WILL WE KNOW? Specifically, how will we be able to tell the macro effects of the tax law? One way is what modelers expect today, which is relatively little increase in growth. https://t.co/iLbiQvKeti
For more on this topic see a recent presentation by @gregleiserson, a paper he wrote last year, or a speech I did the year before. https://t.co/4Yagzq02Fs https://t.co/28TmnNj9oM https://t.co/YJHjMLhw0R
Dynamic analysts did a poor job conveying welfare considerations during the 2017 debate. Here are some ways we could do better next time, ranging from simple (presenting better macro measures like National Income) to complex (presenting fully-microfounded welfare analyses).
TOPIC 3: WELFARE. Ultimately we don’t care about dollars but about well-being, or what economists call welfare. If you have to consume a lot less today to get a little more in the future then you would not want to just celebrate the increase in growth rates.
My own estimate is that after 10 years, if GDP is up then National Income could be anywhere from down 0.1 percent to up 0.1 percent. The range depends on the rate of return foreigners get and whether there is crowd out. https://t.co/uFo1x2GXbQ
It used to be standard to present National Income estimates for dynamic analysis, because many of the policies have systematic effects on capital flows and depreciation so this can have a large effect when evaluating them. https://t.co/Z31TlxdrBY
TOPIC 2: NATIONAL INCOME. This now goes beyond the paper with Robert.		National Income = GDP - net payments to foreigners - depreciation.		It is a better measure of national resources for Americans than GDP.
Our growth estimates are roughly in the middle of the range of other estimates. https://t.co/s691yRYCY1
The growth effects of the law as written are relatively small, averaging 0.04pp annually over the next decade without crowd out and 0.02pp annually over the next decade with crowd out. https://t.co/gPFpJhUwki
The result is increases in most forms of capital averaging to a 3% increase in the long-run capital stock, although R&amp;D goes down. https://t.co/0zQSjsclfl
The 2017 law as written (with expirations) generally cuts user costs for corporations, except for R&amp;D which goes up (due to amortization and other factors). Also user cost for equipment goes up relative to 2017 law, which had bonus depreciation. https://t.co/mRDgPjqej2
My BPEA paper with Robert Barro focused on the incentive effects in the long run, you can find the paper here, these are our main assumptions. https://t.co/y6I9fD8cBO https://t.co/pslFhRWbWL
On the fiscal side, the tax law (plus the spending law) will provide 1.2% of GDP in stimulus in CY 2018 and another 0.4pp on top of it in CY 2019. BUT, it will also lead to deficits of 5% of GDP and higher. https://t.co/xf9yuFgeS1
TOPIC 1: GDP. The 2017 tax law will affect the economy in three ways:		1. Cash flows (minimal, mostly for cash constrained firms)	2. Fiscal (upfront stimulus, medium/long-run crowding out)	3. Incentives (e.g., to work harder or invest more)

(This is because most of the increased DI receipt is aging/more eligible women.)		Also FYI, EPOP for prime age men went down 2.7pp over this period while DI receipt went up 0.2pp.
@econjared Reminds me of a recent conference where I asked people what share of the 1.6m increase in DI recipients from 2008 to 2016 were men age 25-54. 25%? 50%? 75%? No, -1.2%. Most fun I had all week.

@nick_bunker It depends on the question you're asking. In my first thread I was explicitly talking about the question "why has wage growth not picked up lately", which could be understood as why has AHE growth been about the same for the last ~3 years. Change in slack is correct of this q.
Another excellent contribution to the recent discussion about how to analyze slack in the labor market, worth reading. https://t.co/5jE7wlmsTK
@GlobeHorowitz The neoclassical is good at explaining why wages are higher in the United States than in Ghana or today rather than the 1950s.		Of course, changes in bargaining power, slack and the like are also very important. But would not start with any of them.
@GlobeHorowitz If nominal wages grow at inflation + productivity then the labor share is constant.
@GlobeHorowitz Productivity is average product but under reasonable assumptions it grows with marginal product.
@GlobeHorowitz The main neoclassical theory of wages is that they are equal to marginal product. Business wants to pay the lowest wage possible but in perfect competition it will be willing to keep raising it in order to attract more workers until the wage equals the marginal product.
Footnotes:	Wage is 4Q change in average hourly earnings for PNS	Inflation is expected inflation by Survey of Professional Forecasters (Michigan survey has similar delta)	Productivity is also from SPF (actuals are more like 3.0% and 1.0% which would make a stronger point).
Compare 2000:Q1 to 2018:Q1 (similar stages of cycle). Wage diff fully explained by different inflation/productivity:		                  2000:Q1  2018:Q1	UR                4.0%       4.1%	Wage            3.8%       2.5%  	Inflation:      ~2.6%    ~2.1%	Productivity: ~2.5%   ~1.5%
The recent twitter wage curve discussions (mine included) have been missing out on the importance of lower productivity growth and expected inflation. They pretty much account for the entire difference between wage growth in the late 1990s and now.

@ernietedeschi @nick_bunker Agree re Atlanta. But AHE very good. And shows divergence for 1997-2000 vs 2014-17, so not just a noisy quarter.		Noise could mean that ECI overstated or AHE understated. The later says the wage puzzle is less puzzling because wages are really growing faster. Which might be true.
@ernietedeschi I meant over this cycle not the entire period in the charts.
@ernietedeschi Yes, huge important and problematic economic development.		FWIW, over this period real wages fell in Japan and rose in the US. Suggests these differences more consistent with supply (eg, structural) not demand (eg, cyclical).
Apologies to all of twitter for imposing these threads on you. All of twitter except @ernietedeschi @ModeledBehavior @nick_bunker @marthagimbel @econjared @Noahpinion @greg_ip @JayCShambaugh
CONCLUSION OF THREAD: Notwithstanding the above, the EPOP story is compelling and worth continuing to track out of sample, the rapid EPOP improvements are encouraging but the underperformance of AHE/Atlanta Fed is not.
If EPOP does have larger structural trends over time then UR then it is a poor explanatory variable, the R2 is misleading &amp; we would worry out of sample (although, as @ernietedeschi and @ModeledBehavior behavior point out it has done quite well out of same so far).
I worry when I see people making inferences about slack over longer periods of time by using metrics that would clearly fail the test of assessing whether the economy was deeper in recession in 1982 or 2017. A trend of even 1pp/decade hugely complicates inferences over time.
Here is a graph of prime age male EPOP since 1948. Looks anything but stationary. Which year had more slack, 1982 or 2017? The URs were 9.7% and 4.4%. PAM non-employment rates were 13.5% and 14.6%. https://t.co/Jd1IyAu2l7
The issue is that EPOP is only a good measure of slack if it doesn't have large trend movements for structural reasons unrelated to slack (e.g., women entering workforce, mass incarceration). But it does have large trend moves and these did not end in 2000.
THIRD POINT: I am still skeptical of the overall model because it makes what I believe to be the unwarranted assumption that prime age EPOP is stationary, at least since about 2000.
So, even if the EPOP/ECI models are right we still have a puzzle of wage growth for workers underperforming.
For @nick_bunker's sake showing the same for the Atlanta wage tracker (which controls for demographic shifts). The story is similar but weaker: wages outperformed ECI in the late 1990s, underperformed in 2017. https://t.co/mPlgUyMebm
But in the late 1990s average hourly earnings growth was much higher than you would have predicted with ECI, in recent years it has been lower than you would predict with ECI. Slack can't be the explanation because it was already used to predict ECI. https://t.co/qy4FSZHOHw
The @ernietedeschi and @ModeledBehavior regressions are focused on explaining ECI wage &amp; salary growth. ECI fixes industry-occupation weights to effectively present wage growth for an unchanging job structure. This may make sense analytically for their model.
SECOND POINT. Wages for WORKERS (e.g., AHE, Atlanta Fed) are underperforming wages for JOBS (e.g., ECI). This matters because everyone is wondering why wages for workers are not rising faster. Changing the question to ECI does not provide a full answer to this question.
In other words, slack is closing FASTER in the last two years than is apparent from the fall in the UR because labor force participation rates are rising faster than would be expected given the fall in UR.
You can see that in this graph which shows predicted changes in EPOP based on changed in UR. Most of the time changes in UR and changes in EPOP are effectively the same. In 2010-13 EPOP generally underperformed while in 2016-17 it has overperformed. https://t.co/ptAtxTRaWG
FIRST POINT: it is worth being aware/clear that PA EPOP is improving faster than UR lately. Everyone following these issues knows the level fact (EPOP not recovered while UR is), worth knowing the change one too.
Unpeel the onion on @ernietedeschi's very thoughtful tweet thread on measuring slack through the unemployment rate vs. employment population rate first and if you still have any energy read this one too. https://t.co/qW92OJH199

@BDGesq Need to know how much taxes respond to it, how much services respond to tax changes, etc. Magnitude matters, not just sign.
@BDGesq Put another way, SALT is like a Democratic version of trickle down economics. I find it more compelling than the Republican version but that is a low bar also.
@BDGesq I’ll bet the LR incidence of SALT is more progressive than the direct. But I would really want to see a lot more evidence than speculation before I concluded that SALT restructuring was much more progressive than corporate tax restructuring. Which is a low bar to begin with.
The footnote: the estimates are from TPC, I'm saying their estimates of policy changes are the same as what happens with restructuring, which is probably not exactly right.  https://t.co/ukIxXxQyTO	https://t.co/UiaQNwru67
I had previously written about this in a Federal policy context: https://t.co/uiHxO8VbeI
No doubt, there are indirect benefits from making higher-tax States more attractive, preserving their tax bases, and the progressive programs they fund. But you have to think that A LOT of this is going to happen to jump over the high bar of the highly skewed direct effects.
I don't think there is anything wrong with helping States maximize for their citizens subject to the new law. But virtually none of the DIRECT benefit of those efforts will go to households under $100K. In fact, corporate tax minimization will do more for the middle class.
States are considering restructuring their tax systems to get around the new SALT limits. Corporations are restructuring to take advantage of the new rules. This chart shows a comparison of the DIRECT effect of these two sets of efforts. https://t.co/DC1ZsSqgdh

@kausmickey Wages have grown a bit more at the bottom than in the middle in recent years.
@AlanReynoldsEcn @HPublius The fact that the 1981 and 2001 tax cuts were followed by poor wage growth is also raw data. It’s not my burden to explain it.
@AlanReynoldsEcn @HPublius There is a reason people stopped doing time series analysis to infer the employment/wage effects of the minimum wage.		And BTW, what is your model for why a higher minimum wage hurts both employment and wages? I thought you believed in competitive equilibria.
@DJMatthewDalton @marydalyecon That explanation looked more compelling two years ago when they wrote this than it does now. Atlanta Fed tracker—which they note corrects for these compositional effects—has had about the same growth for the last two year. https://t.co/cFs7Qkalpl
@LinkedInEcon 1. Every empirically estimated Phillips curve I have seen looks like the left (although downward wage rigidity can give you some flattening).		2. I think of 25% unemployment rate is more deflationary than 5% unemployment rate. Don't you?
@Mitchell_JoshW @ModeledBehavior If you used prime age male EPOP you would have thought that in 2000 the economy had still not recovered from the 1991 recession.		It has fallen by about 1.5 pp per decade for 60 years.		UR doesn’t have that problem.
@ModeledBehavior @JayCShambaugh @ernietedeschi @JaredBernstein @BetseyStevenson @NickBunker @marthagimbel @steveliesman @rortybomb Yup. At CEA we often used to use age-adjusted UR for Phillips curve.		But UR moves MUCH less in response to age, mass incarceration, women in workforce, etc., than EPOP.		Just like at prime age male UR for last 50 year and prime age male EPOP over that period.
@marthagimbel @JayCShambaugh @ModeledBehavior @ernietedeschi @JaredBernstein @BetseyStevenson @NickBunker @steveliesman @rortybomb In the last 36 months the unemployment rate is down 1.5pp. Based on the 1994-2015 relationship of UR to prime age EPOP would have expected prime age EPOP up 1.3pp over this period. Instead prime age EPOP up 2.0pp over that period. EPOP slack falling faster than UR slack.
@marthagimbel @JayCShambaugh @ModeledBehavior @ernietedeschi @JaredBernstein @BetseyStevenson @NickBunker @steveliesman @rortybomb Question for @ModeledBehavior &amp; @ernietedeschi. I get that you like prime age EPOP. For the sake of argument accepting that. Conditional on that view do you agree it INCREASES the wage puzzle rather than decreasing it?
@arindube @gelbach @rortybomb Women from 1948-2000 is only the most clear example. Prime age male EPOP has fallen nearly steadily since the 1950s.		Moreover, once you control for these trends, you see something that looks just like the unemployment rate—at least for this cycle.
@EconDerek @GoldmanSachs Don’t think data are clear enough to test the hypothesis of a kink.		Intuitively I have a hard time believing that 10% to 4% isn’t a MUCH larger change then 4% to 3% regardless of what the NAIRU is or isn’t.
@rortybomb @JHWeissmann But most measures of inequality have risen less in the 18 years since 2000 than in the 18 years before it.
@JHWeissmann @rortybomb 1. If Adam corrrct then we should be seeing even more wage growth now because EPOP falling faster than UR.		2. Was not saying 94 cherry picked. The earlier data shows why flaw in concept. EPOP, even prime age, moves A LOT for reasons that have nothing to do with slack/cyclical.
@rortybomb (3) Does the structural decline in unions etc. explain the high frequency puzzle of low wage growth? No because we have not seen more deunionization in last 5 yrs. And so if this true should have had even less wage growth earlier.
@rortybomb (2) Does a structural decline in unions etc help explain lower labor share and higher inequality? Also yes.
@rortybomb Three issues: (1) is wage pressure higher when UR is low, which would also raise the labor share. I think yes. Note this says there is a Phillips curve just we may not be able to measure NAIRU enough to use it.
@EconDerek @GoldmanSachs I have seen that but think it raises another puzzle. Effectively there is a PC within cities. But then there is a national fixed effect that changed each year as well. What is the national fixed effect and why is it offsetting what you see at the local level?
@gelbach @rortybomb Not a structural shift. Women entering the workforce through 2000 offsetting men exiting. Was gradual. Could detrend in theory. Or could just use unemployment rate. Or forget the entire slack exercise.
@gregleiserson I agree in principle it could. In practice: (1) way too many people think they’re smart by ignoring UR and discussing LFPR/EPOP only to go badly wrong in missing tends; (2) I’m not confident we can detrend well; and (3) in this cycle would not change the story much/at all.
@ernietedeschi @JaredBernstein @JayCShambaugh @BetseyStevenson @ModeledBehavior @NickBunker @marthagimbel @steveliesman @rortybomb Also my first point was if EPOP measures slack then wage growth should be greater than if UR measures slack.		UR not fallen a whole lot, gains have been more in participation.
@ernietedeschi @JaredBernstein @JayCShambaugh @BetseyStevenson @ModeledBehavior @NickBunker @marthagimbel @steveliesman @rortybomb But unless your demographic adjustment knows what is going on with institutional/cultural changes for women, ways that mass incarceration affects male EPOP, etc, you have a concept that is a priori unreasonable and may just work coincidentally ex post.
@gregleiserson Reasonable detrending of EPOP would find it is about half a percentage point below its 2007-Q4 rate. Which coincidentally (or not) is about where the unemployment rate is.
@joshgerstein Never after @JustinWolfers declares beer o’clock.
CC: @jaredbernstein @JayCShambaugh @BetseyStevenson @ModeledBehavior @nickbunker @marthagimbel @ernietedeschi @steveliesman @rortybomb
In summary, I don’t think alternative measures of slack can rescue the Phillips curve. Alternative measures of wages help a bit but not a lot. May just be the concept is too poorly measured to be useful, see Box 2-9 in the 2016 ERP and @rortybomb today https://t.co/c0hfUBPuMP
The wage puzzle is diminished but only slightly when looking at ECI which has shown more growth than AHE or the Atlanta wage tracker. I am agnostic on which wage measure is best and tend to prefer GS and other trackers that combine them. https://t.co/78yJY1u2eP
The point is that EPOP is measuring much more than just slack. That has mattered a lot over longer periods of time. To view it as a good measure of slack in recent years you have to believe these trends are all of a sudden absent.
@ModeledBehavior has a nice chart showing the close relationship between prime-age EPOP and ECI increases from 1994-2017. But the relationship looks absurd over a longer period. https://t.co/B9ysPAe822 https://t.co/sZsEe0HLob
A separate issue, I would be skeptical of empirical models that try to explain stationary phenomenon (inflation) with non-stationary variables (prime-age EPOP). The fact that prime-age EPOP was much higher in 2018 than in the 1960s tells you nothing about slack.
(An aside: the employer wage setting power / low unionization hypothesis cannot explain the puzzlingly comparatively HIGH rate of wage/price inflation in 2011-12 when UR was ~9%.)
Remember, what matters is NOT if slack is positive (which you would infer from prime-age EPOP) or negative (which you would infer from the overall UR). Less slack means faster wage growth. Not negative slack means faster wage growth. https://t.co/PzrAoPxjOQ
But prime-age EPOP has improved even MORE than the unemployment rate has over this period. If prime-age EPOP is your preferred measure of slack, then you would be predicting even MORE wage acceleration than if you think slack is best measured by the unemployment rate. https://t.co/G6mYa06tPO
The mystery is that 12-month wage growth has been flat for two years now (and actual/expected inflation risen so real wage growth is down) even as the unemployment rate has fallen. https://t.co/PoDS3lp2j6
A number of economists have speculated that the mystery of missing wage growth is explained by the fact that slack is higher measured by prime-age EPOP than by the unemployment rate. In fact, changes in prime-age EPOP actually exacerbate the mystery.
@BetseyStevenson @steveliesman @djlavoie UR is a pretty good measure. And unless you are very sophisticated about demographic and other trends it is the only measure you should be allowed to talk about.		Otherwise you might end up saying still stuff like economy hasn't improved because LFPR flat for 4-1/2 years.
@MikeGrunwald @scottlincicome @Austan_Goolsbee @ObsoleteDogma Stimulus!
@coachbuckethead Nope. Atlanta wage tracker corrects for compositional changes in the workforce by pairing the same workers over time to calculate growth rates. They show a higher LEVEL of growth (3.2% instead of 2.6%) but show no pickup in growth since late 2015. https://t.co/zKiTHkjCUW https://t.co/xYu18G3oZh
The employment population ratio for prime age (25-54) workers was 79.2% in April, which is 0.5pp below its value in the 2007-Q4 peak.		Taking into account elderly employment increases, EPOP is back to pre-recession rates. https://t.co/Au11JAa5RX
Earlier this year there was a puzzle as private wages were growing much faster than production and non supervisory wages. Unfortunately that is being largely resolved in the direction of the PNS numbers.
164K jobs is perfectly good, pace YTD is 200K—faster than the 182K last year. Unemployment of 3.9% is positively exciting. But the ~150m people with jobs care most about wages and up 2.6% in last 12 months is pretty disappointing.

Overall, however, business fixed investment ex oil and mining rose at the same rate in the three years before 2016-Q4 as in the period since then. So would not get too excited just yet. https://t.co/m9oCgY1tS8
This is because oil/mining equipment and structures was up a stunning 80% last year, moderated to 25% in Q1. Oil/mining is volatile and is very affected by oil prices and other sector-specific issues, would not make broader economy-wide inferences from it. https://t.co/yBeBCGsM1Y
One encouraging tidbit in today’s GDP numbers. Headline business fixed investment in 2018-Q1 was the same 6% as in 2017 Q4/Q4. But if you look at BFI excluding oil/mining equipment &amp; structures the growth rate rose from 4% last year to 5% this year. https://t.co/Vz5n35AWhw

But as I said, a source for MODEST concern. Any one data point is volatile—will be very interested when we get Q1 GDO next month. Most importantly, the four quarter change in GDP is 2.9%, which is very strong, but a lot of that is from cyclical rebound.
(5) European GDP also appears to have been weaker in Q1.
(4) The argument for residual seasonality in Q1 may be overblown so people may be overly dismissive of the number. See Fed economists @claudia_sahm and colleagues https://t.co/67UBvD82ul
(3) The underlying Q1 number is weaker than the headline. This is because the headline was boosted by a volatile inventory buildup.
(2) This comes on the heels of a modestly disappointing Q4 when growth was 2.1%. (You might have thought it was 2.9% if you made the mistake of looking at GDP, I’m using GDO which is the better measure.)
But I see five reasons for (very modestly) elevated concern: (1) The tracking estimates were 3% just a month or two ago, this is a deterioration from what were expecting up until recently.
Any single data point should always be taken with a grain of salt, especially first estimates of GDP, and especially in Q1 which MAY suffer from residual seasonality.
GDP was 2.3% in Q1. I prefer to look at PDFP which was 1.7% due to consumption 1.1% and fixed investment 6.1%. The GDP number was somewhat inflated by volatile inventories and exports.
As you prepare to dismiss a weak Q1 as an artifact of BEA’s problems with seasonal adjustment, worth noting BEA has made changes to address this issue &amp; a good case against any residual seasonality for Q1. See @Claudia_Sahm and colleagues at the Fed https://t.co/67UBvD82ul
When the GDP data comes out, you should always turn first to PDFP (which excludes volatile inventories, govt, trade), a better predictor of future growth. And do so especially this month as it may suffer less from residual seasonality. https://t.co/NnIbJ8zyww

CBO’s 3.3% forecast for 2018 is quite an out of consensus bet. They have some reasonable arguments for it but in my gut I would not go out on a limb to bet that growth of 4.0% or higher is just as likely as 2.6% or lower.

@Brian_Riedl @Alan_Krueger @LauraDTyson The entire net in anything can be explained by many different grosses. The CBO fiscal gap is ~2% of GDP. The tax cuts if made permanent are ~1% of GDP. Non-trivial relative to the fiscal gap.
@rortybomb @jbarro @JWMason1 We did this for prime age men in the CEA report. The orange is what should have happened solely based on improving educational attainment--which is a bit less than 0.1pp/yr increase.

@rortybomb I agree on 2001 vs. 2007 as the starting point, the blog discusses the issue. Also agree on education.		BUT, I think any methodology that finds the United States was well below full employment in 1999 and 2000 is likely wrong. And most of your methods would find precisely that.

@JayCShambaugh @D_Blanchflower Conclusion discusses that issue. 2007-Q4 being below full employment is one (among many) coherent arguments consistent with these facts and us still being below full employment. (Although I happen to find this argument not very compelling.)
@D_Blanchflower You’ll get the data on Monday. It uses finer bins than this (see Appendix to blog post), if you do it your way you miss the higher fraction of 60-64 relative to 55-59.
@jfkirkegaard It is not an “argument”, it is a mechanical fact subject to different interpretations.		One interpretation discussed in the conclusion is that trend EPOP should have risen because of favorable trends for older workers. So merely unchanged age-adjusted EPOP is indicative of slack.
@D_Blanchflower Will send to you. But on the off chance I haven't made an idiotic error, you might want to get started on arguments that we're below full employment that are consistent with this fact. Our blog is once place to start for such an argument: https://t.co/JJzRKLSWBd

Adjusted for age, the slight increase in employment-population rate reflects the fact that the labor force participation rate is 0.3 pp below its pre-recession level while the unemployment rate has fallen by even more. https://t.co/fAme3A8EG7
The trends for age/gender groups are similar to the 2001-07 business cycle, although the employment gains for older workers and the employment losses for younger workers have been smaller in the current cycle. https://t.co/N0DwC1aN9L
The 0.1 percentage point increase in the age-adjusted employment rate from 2007-Q4 to 2018-Q1 reflects a combination of the following age-adjusted changes:	—Fell 2.3 pp for people age 16-24	—Fell 0.4 pp for people age 25-54	—Rose 1.7 pp for people age 55+ https://t.co/HyOo0UlDxy
The employment-population ratio is now back to where it was prior to the recession adjusted for aging. This reflects employment increases for age 55+ outweighing employment declines for ages 16-54.

@Brian_Riedl 1. Their argument in the first oped was intl capital markets will restrain interest rate increases while in the second one it was that it would amplify them.		2. Entitlements outlook hasn’t changed, if anything Medicare deficit smaller than a decade ago.
Hoover economists warn about debt/entitlements while saying the tax cuts were "only" cost 0.4% of GDP in 2025. For comparison, the Medicare Hospital Insurance deficit over the next 75 years totals 0.3% of GDP.		(Also, if tax cuts made permanent cost is 1% of GDP in 2027.)

BEA measures the economy by adding up spending (up 2.9% in Q4) and income (up 0.9% in Q4). In theory should be the same, differ because of measurement error, the avg (1.9%) is a more accurate measure.
GDP for Q4 revised up from 2.5% to 2.9% (for good reasons, mostly higher C). But the big news is that GDO came in at 1.9%, suggesting a weaker quarter than the headline suggests.

@de1ong @JayCShambaugh Yes
@de1ong @JayCShambaugh The policy we are estimating is the tax law Congress passed + a $900 payment per household per year. Or the tax law with the 2019 provisions permanent with a $1,400 payment per household per year. Even crowd out has these offsets in the background, albeit implicitly delayed.
Bottom line: I've learned a lot from this collaboration which was, to say the least, never dull. And the results are all preliminary-so comments most welcome.
We wrote separate conclusions to the paper, you can read my broader views on the model and context there. https://t.co/KG9rc4cIuR
Also focusing on long-run comparative statics is like looking at the long-run benefits (higher level of growth) without discounting the time it takes to get there and looking at the costs of getting there (e.g., reduced consumption to generate the savings to get the capital).
Bigger issue is how to interpret the model. Some key assumptions: infinitely elastic capital (so no interest rate increases) and tax cuts are eventually paid for.
The model has intl shifting due to marginal rate changes but not average rate changes. The later could be an important plus or minus to our results. But the sign is ambiguous because the law cut the average rate for U.S. investments and for foreign investments as well.
I think we used reasonable parameters for the model-although just about all of them prone to find larger growth effects than the standard parameters used by JCT/Treasury/AEI etc. E.g., cost of capital equation, capital share, capital supply elasticity, sectoral shifting.
The bulk of the paper is an examination of the long-run impacts of the tax law on capital formation and growth using a Ramsey-style model. I think this is Robert's preferred model, I am more ecumenical and think it is one among many useful perspectives.
The paper finds that making the tax law in effect in 2019 permanent would add another 0.1pp to the growth rate while costing more. It also finds that we could add another 0.2pp to the growth rate while raising revenue with higher rates, broader expensing, and no interest dedns.
By way of comparison, if Congress had just made the 50% bonus that was in the law (at least) from 2008-17 permanent, it would have raised the growth rate by about the same amount at one-sixth the cost of the law Congress passed. (0.03pp/yr on growth with or without crowd out.) https://t.co/JkVJD9Td1e
The key result in our base specification is that the actual tax law would raise GDP growth by 0.04pp/yr over the next decade. In our sensitivity analysis, we find that if deficits raise interest rates (a proposition I believe but Robert doesn't), that would be 0.02pp. https://t.co/ZXX2qJwL1b

Standard error for FY 2018 forecast is ~0.5% GDP and for the FY 2019 forecast is ~1.5% of GDP.		That means the chance the deficit is over $1T is 13% this yr and 68% next yr.		The chance the deficit is below last years $667b is 1% this yr and 6% next yr.
The following shows why projected deficits have risen so much since Jan 2017. Negative economic/technical have played a surprisingly big role (i.e., mostly surprisingly low revenue given GDP). Note this scenario assumes most of the bad surprise in 2017/18 was transitory. https://t.co/2XfGkqBuo0
@DeanBaker13 The distribution in this paper was based on the historical variance of actual productivity. I have also done it using the historical errors in CBO forecasts and that does give you somewhat fatter tails but not a radically different conclusion.

We should do everything we can to push demand as far as possible. Even more important, we should do everything we can to raise LFPR and productivity growth. But, important not to be unrealistic in making plans or overly disappointed by normal historical performance. (END THREAD)
This actually should not have been a surprise. Long-term forecasts expected these growth rates. For example, in 2005 Social Security Trustees projected 1.8% annual growth from 2020 to 2030. This is not a new normal, more like an old normal.
Underlying potential growth has been less than 1.25%. That is largely because of the aging population. With recent productivity growth total growth would be 1.6%. With historic productivity growth it would be 2.1%. Hard to justify a medium-term forecast much outside that range.
These could continue into 2018, especially with the roughly $250 billion of fiscal stimulus. But they can’t continue for several more years.
On demand, much of success in 2017 will be hard to repeat much longer: (1) stock-driven consumption, (2) a depreciating dollar keeping net exports roughly stable, and (3) an unemployment rate declining by 0.6 percentage point.

@econwonk From todays' vantage point their near-term interest rate forecast is obviously too low. But their long-term one doesn't seem obviously crazy given the internal logic of 2.8% growth but also of the proposed deficit reduction. That said, I haven't quantified this.
@econwonk They locked this forecast in Nov. Last forecast was locked in March. A downward revision in interest rates was reasonable: 10 yr forward rates for 10 yr were down ~50 bps and the actual 10 yr was 70 bp below their forecast.
@econwonk I don't think the interest rate projections are crazy (and market expectations are for even lower interest rates). Relative to other forecasts, the Admin should increase rates to reflect higher growth and reduce to reflect more proposed deficit reduction. These plausibly offset.
@greg_ip Also, they seem to be predicting their policies add 0.25pp to GDP growth. (Possibly even less if some of the $813b they ascribe to policy is actually the result of lower interest rates due to proposed deficit reduction.)
@greg_ip I already factored in an (implausibly large) version of that when I said they needed 2.5% NFB productivity growth instead of the 2.8% you would get otherwise. (And Okun’s Law de facto incorporates age-adjusted LFPR rising as UR falls.)
@rokumar1918 If you're saying you wouldn't be surprised to see them show up in a "future law" I would agree. But until they pass at the last minute, their omission will be a budget gimmick that masks the true magnitude of coming deficits/debt and understates the role of taxes in that problem.

The Administration's long-run forecast is equally fanciful. The 2.8% potential growth rate is less absurd than the 3.0% in last year's budget. But it compares to 1.8% for the FOMC and 2.15% for the SPF's long run forecast.
For perspective, 2.5% nonfarm business productivity growth is much higher than the 1.1% last year, the 1.1% over the last decade, the 1.8% over the last 50 years. In fact, it is faster than any decade since 1948. That is why the FOMC and SPF don't predict anything like this.
This means the Administration is assuming potential GDP growth over the next three years of ~2.9%. To get this they would have to assume ~2.8% growth in non-farm productivity growth. If you were more optimistic about hours/employment you could get that down to 2.5%.
It is hard to understand where this growth would be coming from. The Admin only has the unemployment rate falling by 0.3pp over those three years (which may, in fact, be too pessimistic). That means ~0.2pp annually is coming from closing the Okun's law gap in their forecast.
(Also, the Admin appears to be projecting their policies add ~0.25pp to the growth rate. According to Table S-2 the "Effect of the post-policy boost to economic growth" is $813b, which from Analytical Perspectives Table 2-4 is equivalent to a ~0.25pp increase in the growth rate.)
The Administration's forecast is, by convention, post-policy. But the tax cuts have already passed so are so in everyone's forecasts and most regulatory changes are presumably in everyone's forecasts as well.
To get a sense of how crazy that is, in December the 16 FOMC Members submitted their forecasts for 2018, 2019 and 2020. The most optimistic of these were 2.8%/2.4%/2.2%. The Administration is 3.1%/3.2%/3.1%.
The Administration's economic forecast is even more wildly optimistic than last year. The assumption of 3.1% annualized growth over the next three years. For comparison, the FOMC's median of 2.2% and the Survey of Professional Forecasters 2.4%. (START THREAD)
@jeffspross If you define sustainability as a falling debt/GDP ratio then it certainly does. The debt/GDP is sustainable if the unified deficit equals the nominal growth rate times the debt/GDP ratio. That is about 3% right now.
@jeffspross No definitive answer, corresponds to sustainability going forward, roughly inline with IMF recommendations around the world. Could see an argument for being a bit more aggressive.
To achieve this goal we will need a lot more revenue. Ideally we would raise that revenue in an efficient, simplifying and progressive manner as I described here https://t.co/XO5irNMj5B. (END THREAD)
Our fiscal goal should be a gently declining debt/GDP ratio. This requires that the deficit average about 3% of GDP over the cycle. It should be better than that when growth is strong and the unemployment rate is low.
It is amazing that that the debt/GDP ratio is projected to RISE by more than 3 percentage points over the next two years even under the assumption of a strengthening of economic performance, no unanticipated expenditures, and continued low interest rates.
(As an aside, in comparing spending over longer periods you need to adjust for the fact that the population is older and economywide healthcare costs are higher. Whatever you thought spending/GDP should be in 1980, it should be higher today for these reasons.)
Revenue is the main reason the Admin projects a deficit of 4.7% of GDP in FY 2019, or $984 billion (numbers that do not include the recent spending law, assume no natural disasters or military emergencies and assume a 10-year Treasury avg is 2.85% in CY 18/19, its current rate).
I picked FY 2019 because it is when the Administration projects the strongest cyclical performance-3.2% GDP growth and the trough of the unemployment rate. At a time like this revenue should be MUCH higher as a share of GDP.
In FY 2019 revenue is projected to be only 16.3% of GDP. The only time we have had lower revenue in the last 50 years was in the aftermath of the last two recessions. Even the 1980s recession and tax cuts only brought revenue down to 16.9% of GDP.
The President's budget shows just how serious our revenue problem has become. And how this revenue problem is driving our deficit problem. (START THREAD)
Recall that last year’s budget only balanced because of a gigantic double count—they included the tax cut in the growth forecasts but not the revenue numbers. Can’t play that trick again. https://t.co/qIdMF4lPik

@Brian_Riedl Care to show everyone those numbers: (1) under current policy baselines and (2) in year 8 of each Administration (more indicative of long-term). And share of GDP for all of them.
Actually, the WH lowering its interest rate forecast may be reasonable (although in some tension with their optimism on growth). The 10yr is currently much lower than what they had predicted last year and their forecast is similar to CBO etc. and below forward rates.
@BBKogan The phrase “most of its major” was intended to cover infrastructure.
This puts the White House GDP forecast about 1pp above private sector forecasts and the FOMC expectation.		Last year they explained the gap as the White House forecast being based on its policies. But most of its major policies are now law so they are in everyone’s forecasts.
The new White House GDP forecast is even more optimistic than last year’s forecast, even while they lower forecasted interest rates. https://t.co/xS6z9CXmxk

@t0nyyates @M_C_Klein @DuncanWeldon Put another way, I could see an argument for holding off any more rate hikes until inflation is on a path to 2.5% or even higher (if they were explicit about it).		I don't see a macroeconomic argument for tighter monetary policy and looser fiscal policy.
@t0nyyates @M_C_Klein @DuncanWeldon The Fed should seriously consider changing its target or some other rule change (partial/full price level targeting, NGDP, etc.) and should be more dovish in the meantime.		But right now the Fed has a 2% target and is tightening policy to hit it. Nothing fiscal can do about that.
@BetseyStevenson If/when the next recession comes I will be pushing for fiscal stimulus no matter where our deficit/debt are going into it. I think there will be ECONOMIC room for stimulus. I think we do need to worry about POLITICAL room for stimulus (see, eg, 2009-12).
@MarcGoldwein @greg_ip You could always enforce it with a sequester because that will certainly bring everyone to the table to deal seriously with the issues.
@MESandbu I think you're also assuming: (3) if you're wrong fiscal policy can reverse course and (4) there are minimal long-run costs to deficits of this magnitude.
@MESandbu The fiscal stimulus case for all of this requires a series of assumptions that are individually shaky and collectively highly implausible.
@MESandbu There is an argument for this, but is about domestic spending being good (for priorities like education, research, anti-poverty, etc.). And we'll let the future sort out how to make the budget constraint work.
@MESandbu You need a stronger assumption than that, specifically that the Fed is on an excessively hawkish autopilot so would not respond to offset this (and remember with the stimulus 1-2 years away they can offset it if they want).
@MESandbu That is why the Fed should err on the dovish side, it can easily reverse and no long-term cost since some extra inflation is fine with me.		But I see no argument for a big fiscal stimulus in 2019/20 unless you're really sure we still won't be at FE in 2020 and MP is constrained.
@MESandbu Argument hinges on:		1. Monetary policy is unconstrained so does not need fiscal help.		2. The fiscal expansion here is largely in 2019 and 2020 (outlays take a while, especially for defense).		3. Can reverse monetary policy quickly whereas these deficits just mount forever.
@LoganMohtashami Revenue less than 17% of GDP was not caused by demographics. And I like the higher cap on domestic spending but still have a naive belief in paying for things so as not to dig the hole any deeper.
@OneNationWhig Should have had a larger stimulus so larger deficits in the years immediately following the financial crisis.
Also is hard to seriously assess what spending is worthwhile and what is not when you don't have a budget constraint. This deal seems to have much more than just the kitchen sink thrown into it.		Oh, and it appears to have another round of corporate tax cuts in it.
I consider myself a deficit dove. I'm comfortable with 3% GDP deficits--and higher in downturns. I don't think deficit reduction should be our top priority.		But, deliberately sending an essentially full employment economy into deficits of 5% to 7% of GDP is nuts.
@econjared @FHMonitor I was wrong--actually well above 2017 levels as a share of GDP, although the outlays will take a bit to spend out--especially on the defense side.
@UnimpressedTX Nope

@FHMonitor @econjared I believe--but am not certain--that a lot of the spending is a continuation of current spending levels. So is stimulus relative to what would have happened absent a deal. But not relative to what is in place this year.

@Fava @Noahpinion %GDP is the right way to measure the size of a fiscal stimulus. ARRA+other fiscal response was ~3% GDP (which was too low) and this is shaping up to be ~1.5% of GDP (which is too high). @jimtankersley's broad points are correct but I think this claim overstates the comparison.
@RichardRubinDC @jimtankersley I always take AMT out when doing macro analyses. But ARRA was also rescored as costing more than originally scored, that roughly offsets the AMT patch component.
While fiscal stimulus makes zero sense right now, the 2009/10 stimulus about twice as large as this. Two problems with this comparison:		1. You need to do shares of GDP, comparing nominal numbers a decade apart is not meaningful.		2. Ignores 12 fiscal stimulus bills after ARRA. https://t.co/eK8FBkrGvf

@greg_ip @erikbryn Given our demographic structure, 1.3% productivity is about 1.5% potential GDP growth. A lot less than most people are expecting. And this is off a good pair of quarters.
2016:Q4 to 2017:Q4 (annual rate):	Productivity: +1.1%	Real wages: +0.3%		2013:Q4 to 2016:Q4 (annual rate):	Productivity: +0.6%	Real wages: +0.8%		Productivity is picking up from the last 3 yr, real wages are not, partly about increase in inflation, but similar pattern in nominal.
Non-farm business productivity grew only 1.1% in the last four quarters. That is slightly below the pace from 2007-16. And consistent with ~1.3% potential GDP growth. https://t.co/C2mqEa6Mr0
@erikbryn Don't ever look at quarterly productivity numbers! (And should not be surprising because we already knew GDP +2.6% and hours +2.7% so I had pencilled in 0.0% for this release.)		Productivity growth over the last four quarters of only 1.1% is truly disappointing.

@Capitalics I was two for three on my pet issues—with BEA adding reporting for GDO and PDFP but they did not switch on this. CEA generally reported Q4/Q4 data, however.
In other words, when you look at the 2.3% annual average growth rate for 2017 remember that it puts three times as much weight on the 1.8% from 2016-Q4 as it does on the 2.6% from 2017-Q4. Which is rather odd.
2017 annual average growth ≈ (2016-Q2 + 2*2016-Q3 + 3*2016-Q4 + 4*2017-Q1 + 3*2017-Q2 + 2*2017-Q3 + 2017-Q4) / 16		2017 Q4/Q4 growth ≈ (2017-Q1 + 2017-Q2 + 2017-Q3 + 2017-Q4) / 4
Public service announcement: if you want to understand how the economy did in 2017 look at Q4/Q4 growth rates (2.5% for GDP), not annual average growth rates (2.3% for GDP).		The widespread use of annual avgs is a mistake since about 37% of the 2017 annual avg is growth in 2016.
@TommyTd78 We don't have Q4 data for productivity, but looks like it will be about 1.2% in 2017 (Q4/Q4). That is better than the 0.7% over the previous 5 years but on par with the 1.2% over the business cycle as a whole.
@MortimerleePaul I think you see a bit of that. Would not read anything into Q4 inventories which just was a bounceback from Q3. But the inventory-sales ratio has generally been falling for the last two years.
(3) Productivity growth likely ~1.2% in 2017 (Q4 not released yet so guessing a bit). A good rule of thumb is potential GDP growth is 0.1 pp higher than NFB productivity growth (0.8pp for popln growth, -0.4pp for LFPR, and -0.3pp for economy vs. NFB). So potential grew 1.3%.
(2) Unemployment rate was down 0.6pp last year. Using an Okun’s law coefficient of 2.25, that added 1.35pp to growth. Subtracting that from the actual growth rate potential was 1.1%.
Three ways to get potential: (1) Hours were up 2.1% last year. Based on population/age structure, potential is 0.4%. So subtract 1.7 pp from growth and you’re at 0.8pp for potential.
The 2.5% GDP growth in 2017 is consistent with about a 1% potential growth rate plus 1.5 pp from the falling unemployment rate. With relatively little room left for cyclical improvement, we’ll need much more productivity growth to even get to 2.0% growth. (SHORT THREAD)
A lot of the growth in the last two years has been driven by consumption outpacing income. As a result, the personal savings rate has fallen from 6% to 3%. Capital gains have helped, but not clear how sustainable this will be. https://t.co/66UM63reeP
@RWBhandari A lot of the increase is oil-related, will have more on that later today when BEA releases the full detail.
If you were overly excited about 3.2% growth last quarter you were wrong. And if you are underwhelmed by 2.6% growth this quarter you are wrong. Inventories added 0.8 pp in Q3 and subtracted 0.7 pp in Q4.
Overall economy grew at a 2.5% annual rate in 2017, with 2.8% growth in consumption, 6.3% in business fixed investment, 2.3% growth in residential, and everything else small and roughly offsetting.
Good news in the report is consumer spending up 3.6% and business fixed investment up 6.8%. Residential also up 11.6%, making up for the declines in Q2 and Q3. Biggest minus was inventories.
GDP up 2.6% in Q4. But the underlying data better than the headline, with my preferred measure PDFP excluding volatile inventories, NX and govt spending up 4.6%.

“Repeal and Replace”—aka tax reform—would be a better approach going forward. END THREAD. https://t.co/oFl1g1Cidv
Here are some infeasible or undesirable options for tax changes going forward. https://t.co/PnQX0tnttB
Some qualifications on all of this analysis, the most important being that future legislation will matter a lot.
Note that all of this growth comes from lower AVERAGE rates, the effect of MARGINAL rates on long-run growth is negative. Important because this growth could disappear or reverse if other countries cut their rates in response.
But adding in the other provisions &amp; a modest amount of crowd out (interest rates up 15 bp) reduces the growth effects to a 0.3 percent increase in the long-run level of output, which would be imperceptible in annual growth rates.
Modeling just the redn of the corporate rate to 21% predicts a 1.64% boost in long-run GDP, or a 0.08 pp increase in the annual growth rate over 10 yrs. This is similar to the conclusion of AEI researchers @aparnamath &amp; Cody Kallen for a 20% rate. https://t.co/MzO6XZwmHK
I should say, I am indebted to AEI researchers and https://t.co/yGAN1vBt0p for the models underlying many of these calculations. Their spreadsheet is available at https://t.co/DqEAehgzCX, I will be making my analysis available as well.
The EMTR falls then rises for equipment, falls for structures, and rises and rises more for R&amp;D. https://t.co/fQp5kexyOR
Taking all of these into account, the overall marginal tax rate on corporate investment falls at first but then rises—well above current rates and somewhat above the baseline. https://t.co/Raahsd4Zba
Repealing the manuf deduction, capping interest dedn, ending expensing of R&amp;D and limiting NOLs may be good or bad (and I would put the first two in the good category and last two in the bad), but all have economic consequences that must be incorporated in any macro analysis.
MODELING THE FULL PLAN. The biggest issue is that the larger estimates generally just cover the rate reduction part of the plan &amp; ignore the rest. Is like saying that a tax reform that cut rates in half but required people to pay on twice their taxable income would boost growth. https://t.co/SJdl0OV9Ga
CORRECTLY MODELING THE CORPORATE SECTOR. Economists all know K/Y  ≈ 3 but forget corporate capital is only about two-thirds of GDP. Need an 18% increase to get 3% more GDP—and much more needed if capital comes from residential/non-corporate sectors as is likely/desirable. https://t.co/EtKJGvs9h0
CROWD OUT. Most debate about this but not most important factor. And is more than just borrowing driving up interest rates &amp; reducing investment. Includes diversion of capital from residential/non-corporate &amp; increased foreign borrowing lowering GNP/NI relative to GDP.
Normally when economists debate they are using different models or elasticities. In most of these cases, however, the models/elasticities are the same. The differences are: (1) crowd out; (2) correctly modeling the size of the corporate sector; and (3) modeling the full plan.
Estimates focusing just on the corporate rate reduction (with or without expensing) have tended to find larger estimates—although even these estimates are generally consistent with only a 0.1 to 0.2 pp increase in the annual growth rate over the next decade. https://t.co/d0CcTBTq3f
The bulk of the non-political estimates of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act put the annual growth increase over the next decade at 0.0 to 0.1 pp. That is consistent with the FOMC, SPF, Blue Chip, others not updating long-run potential growth. https://t.co/dWgI2TWbRG

In other words, JCT finds the corporate tax cut adds only 0.1 to 0.2% to output level after 10 yrs. Likely because:		1. Does not lower the MTR very much, especially on equipment.		2. Diverts capital from non- C-corp sector and housing.		3. A tiny bit of crowd out from deficits.
The JCT score shows an average of 0.7% higher GDP over the window. But is 0.8-0.9% while individual in effect and 0.1-0.2% after they sunset.
JCT dynamic score just out. Shows:		1. Annual growth rate is 0.01 to 0.02 pp higher over ten years. (Yes, less than 2 hundredths of a percent.)		2. Tax cut costs $1.071T		3. Conference bill is more costly and less pro-growth than House or Senate.		https://t.co/Z4hHNwXfHq
@eurocanard @JoPiercy @BullMooseFuture JCT did not include the estate tax in their distn model.
Both TPC and ITEP show a larger fraction of top 1%ers will see a tax increase next year than any of the bottom four quintiles, even counting the benefits of the corporate cut.		(Still on average a larger cut for the top 1% relative to incomes, so worsens inequality.)

@greg_ip @carlquintanilla Don’t we care about after-tax/transfer incomes?

@inclusionist @WSJopinion Everything in this applies to women. Some issues not mentioned here may be more important for women than for men like flexible workplaces and childcare. Will come back to those in a future oped.
Prime age women's participation has been declining since around 2000, I plan to discuss the causes/solutions in a future oped, many overlap but some differences too.
No magic bullet, solns include:	1. Making work pay better, market wages &amp; after-tax wages	2. Criminal justice reform	3. Addressing opioid epidemic	4. Wage insurance	5. Transitional UI for long-term unemployed	6. More training/jobs search assistance
Other big issues: rise of incarceration and opioid epidemic.
Instead the problem is it is less rewarding to work. Men with HS or less, who have seen their employment rates fall from 97% in 1964 to 83% today. This has coincided with a decline in their relative wages: HS earn 1/2 of college, down from 2/3s in 1970s.
Also, other cash support for prime age men like worker's comp, unemployemnt insurance, AFDC/TANF has actually declined. So overall cash receipt has fallen to 10% in 2016 from 20% in 1975. (Noncash Medicaid and SNAP up, mostly since 2005, but work decline largely predates that.)
Some blame Disability Insurance. But it has only increased 1.6 pp since the 1960s while overall employment has dropped 8.4 pp. And some DI increased caused by lack of employment.
One of the major economic challenges we face is the fact the employment rate among men 25-54 has dropped from 96% in the 1950s to 86% today.

@MichaelRStrain @JayCShambaugh They assumed individual tax cuts expire so did not have huge ongoing debt (just the large legacy of the $1.5T). They hinted at possible negative in third decade. And they showed GDP, when GNP or NI is the better measure for welfare purposes and would be lower.
@MichaelRStrain @JayCShambaugh But no one presenting estimates for National Income (which used to be the standard metric people would show for dynamic analysis). And no one doing a current policy baseline for their dynamic scores.
@MichaelRStrain @JayCShambaugh About zero. I would expect a small neg for National Income on a current policy baseline (ie, assume bonus perm in baseline and assume everything in bill is permanent.

@JayCShambaugh To be clear--this shows EMTRs in the future are higher than today. They are still lower than they would be under current law in 2023+ bcause bonus depreciation goes away.		In other words, we could have gotten better LR EMTRs just from making bonus permanent w/o even cutting rates
@MattHJensen @MichaelRStrain I think extension is perfectly possible. But also think that if our debt is ~90% of GDP and deficit is rising, people might not want to extend a corporate tax cut. So could go either way. Historically bonus depreciation and ITCs have been altered quite a lot.
The effective marginal tax rates on equipment investment in the Senate bill are really weird. A huge incentive to pull investment forward into 2018.

9 leading GOP economists agree: "Our letter addresses the impact of corporate tax reform on GDP; we did not offer claims about the speed of adjustment to a long-run result (though official revenue estimators will obviously need to do so for short-run analysis)."
Here are two studies (by Treasury and OECD) that find the 10-yr or 10th year effect is about 30-40% of the long-run effect. https://t.co/WxeLKATNju
Advocates keep arguing the tax cuts raise the level of GDP by 3% to 5%. Even if correct, the studies they are using are about the LONG RUN and say nothing about growth/dynamic feedback in the budget window which is likely much less.

@RichardRubinDC @ByronTau Seriously they might do that? With expensing would result in a really high marginal tax rate on investment (because you expense at a lower rate than the tax on your earnings).		Also a big incentive to delay investment (because waiting gets you more valuable expensing).
I would add that the 10-year annual growth rates consistent with the letter nine Republican economists sent Mnuchin was 0.1 to 0.2 pp (and file them under models that ignored debt). https://t.co/UvGvEBnYqd
@ScottElliotG @nittiaj @RichardRubinDC Assuming it is a level jump, it is a 0.8% increase in year 1 and a 0.0% increase in subsequent years. That gets you a 0.8% average effect and a 0.08pp increase in annualized GDP growth over the window. See full discussion in this mini-tweetstorm. https://t.co/Jorx4Mh3Pl
@laseptiemewilay @econwonk Less than 0.1pp/yr, low growth number
@econwonk If I had to guess, however, I would think Model 3 might be closest to the bill—showing the buildup before expensing expires and then the falloff after the individual provisions expire. (Don’t take 0.06 as exact rate, point is less than 0.08)
@econwonk The increase in labor supply will look like Model 2 (a level effect). Based on past year-by-year models, the increase in capital will be a combo of Model 1 and Model 2—with an initial jump followed by a gradual increase.
@econwonk This picture shows three models. Model 1 has the level growing over the window, model 2 is flat, model 3 is a bit odd—but so is the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. https://t.co/CdKz9Ks5Bh
A few have asked how to translate the JCT estimate of 0.8% average growth over the decade into an annual growth rate. Short answer: According to JCT it is less than 0.1 percentage point per year. (h/t @econwonk) https://t.co/zzgfSxBLDU
@ScottElliotG @nittiaj @RichardRubinDC Strongly disagree. Think 0.08% annual is reasonable/conservative for a plausible annual growth number.		Labor effect is a level, expensing front loads gains, and level may even fall back down in last two years. Optimistically assuming flat 0.8% on level which gets 0.08% growth.
You could pre-written that one a year ago. https://t.co/f7eGFT6k3A
The JCT shows more growth from increased labor supply than I expected and even less from capital than I expected. Will dig into that.
JCT: "capital... is about 1.1 percent higher on average over the budget window than in the baseline forecast"		Enthusiasts have been tossing around numbers like 10%-20% for the increased long-run capital stock.		Either 10-20% is too high or the LR is pretty far from now.
I have been saying for months wait of the JCT dynamic score. It is now here. The cost is over $1T (with gimmicky expirations). Output increases an avg of 0.8 percent over the window. https://t.co/Uto5hmMZZE

@djheakin Oh, and more evidence is the lack of any career Treasury staff report showing that the tax cuts pay for themselves.
@djheakin Every other random sample of economists--both Republican and Democratic--shows the same thing. The Booth Survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the major Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs, and the Penn Wharton Budget Model.
@djheakin When you see a letter with 100 mostly random names that tells you that almost everyone you have heard of refused to sign the letter. And that only a small %age of the people asked agreed to sign.
Evidence that most economists are skeptical of large growth claims: a letter asserting the tax cuts pay for themselves was circulated widely (several friends of mine were asked to sign). Only a few major economists (most notably @djheakin) actually did https://t.co/SD8qTtmx4L
@UpdatedPriors Yes. And one could debate the likelihood of it ending. But tax reform was supposed to be about us not having a more stable, predictable system, not about debating likelihoods of triggers/sunsets/phase ins/etc.
@Henry_Curr @UpdatedPriors MARGINAL rates are about marginal investments. Rents come from inframarginal.		There are arguments for average tax rates mattering too, I think they have some merit, but most of the models are (appropriately) about marginal rates.
@ScottElliotG @UpdatedPriors Correct. Put another way, we would get lower marginal rates just from making bonus depreciation permanent instead of passing the entire bill.
@UpdatedPriors I guess you can update your priors now (guessing they were relatively flat to start with on this particular question).
@UpdatedPriors Also, the EMTR for equipment (not structures) under these bills would be higher in 2023 than it is today because EMTR of 35% rate + bonus depreciation &lt; 20% rate + normal deprecation.		(May tweet more on this later.)
@UpdatedPriors If you have expensing and a 35% rate then the marginal rate is zero (govt pays for 35% of your upfront investment and takes 35% of the returns). If interest is deductible then cutting the rate to 20% LOWERS the value of the interest dedn, raising the effective marginal rate.
@crfb @LHSummers Here is the link to the letter @lhsummers and I wrote asking these questions of the nine Republican economists. https://t.co/Hl6Ozk6TbK
@crfb @lhsummers and I asked a number of questions of the authors of the letter yesterday. Several authors were open and helpful in providing their sources and I thank them for that. But would love a substantive response to the questions that Larry and I raised.
@crfb These issues are just the tip of an iceberg of serious issues on ways in which the plan raises marginal rates on business investment, increases the trade deficit, worsens the fiscal outlook, creates new passthrough loopholes, etc.
@crfb A growth rate of 0.06% and a growth rate of 0.3% or 0.4% are really different in their (perceived, somewhat incorrectly) implications for whether the tax cut pays for itself.
And the details and numbers really, really matter. Republicans in Congress are arguing that if growth goes up 0.4 pp then it won’t add to the debt (actually, the correct number needed per @CRFB is 0.8 pp). https://t.co/fSMmRSvRCD
This may sound rude or picky, but this was one of only three models that was explicitly called out in their letter (and another model was also misrepresented, see here). https://t.co/MYTLaqrOcZ
In summary, in order to generate a 0.06% increase in the annual growth rate using the OECD’s model the Republican economists had to assume the corporate tax cut (after dynamic scoring) cost $3.6T.
According to CBO’s sensitivity tables, that would offset $169b of the cost of the tax cut—leaving a dynamic cost of $3.6T. (With rounding could be a little higher or lower.) https://t.co/6bNM0UlfqZ
But to be fair, we should count the boost from growth. Assuming the Republican economists are right on a 2% increase in the long-run level the same OECD model puts that at a 0.06% increase in the growth rate over the next decade.
CBO projects GDP of $237T over the next decade, so 1.6% * $237T = $3.8T static cost of the tax cut.
So to get a 2% of GDP growth you would need to assume the corporate tax cut would cost about 1.6% of GDP ( (1.6/.98)*1.25 = 2.0%).
The OECD model found that each 0.98 pp of reduction in corporate taxes as a share of GDP would raise the level of long-run output by 1.25%. https://t.co/gYcR8DgpcS https://t.co/kfa3fn9q1t
On Sunday nine Republican economists sent a letter to Secretary Mnuchin that included the claim “estimates from the OECD suggest that corporate tax changes alone would raise long-run GDP by 2%.” https://t.co/KFJHQK8Qde
SHOCKING NEW CLAIM: nine leading Republican economists informed Secretary Mnuchin that just the corporate tax cut alone could cost $3.6 trillion even after accounting for dynamic scoring. (Warning: clickbait thread to follow with a serious message at the end.)

@LHSummers @djheakin Will have many more questions for the economists in the letter in a forthcoming piece with @LHSummers.
@LHSummers To be clear, I could be a bit off on this. And could argue the math. But I’m not the one writing a letter to the Treasury Secretary with my own growth estimates. I’m the one agreeing with @djheakin and all the other former CBO Director's that: https://t.co/vaLC7or3kY https://t.co/BOfr42QCBP
@LHSummers Based on the OECD’s parameters, it seems more reasonable to say that the corporate tax cut will boost the level of long-run GDP by 0.3%. Looking at the first decade the annual growth rate would go up by 0.01pp.
@LHSummers But I also can’t figure out how they even got to a 2% long-run effect. The OECD study says that a 1% of GDP corporate rate cut leads to a 1.25% increase in long-run output. The corporate tax cuts are much less than 1% of GDP so should add much less than 1.25% to output. https://t.co/F36AWsApIu
@LHSummers Here is the relevant table from that OECD report. First thing to notice, the 10th-year effect is 30% of the long-run effect. So applying their 2% long-run number generates only a 0.6% increase in GDP in year 10—or a 0.06pp/yr increase in the growth rate. https://t.co/xVx4hyNXkr
@LHSummers It turns out a second study contradicts it—and to an even greater degree. Specifically, they cite the OECD as the basis for the statement that the bills would raise LONG-RUN GDP by 2%. https://t.co/adXjxiQh4Z
@LHSummers The Republican economists estimate that the corporate tax cut will boost growth by 0.3pp. They cite three studies. Yesterday I tweeted about how one of them actually contradicts this conclusion.  https://t.co/MYTLaqrOcZ
@LHSummers &amp; I have a piece coming soon on the Republican economists tax letter. Wanted to preview what appears to be another outright error they made. One of the three sources they cited appears to predict an annual growth boost of 0.01pp (yes, one-tenth of one-tenth of a 1%.)
If only the main large business lobbying group @BizRoundtable had more clout the tax bill would be considerably less bad. cc:@mattyglesias https://t.co/Yn1Opm0aiO
@RichardRubinDC Worth remembering that the tax cut is 0.2% of GDP in FY 2018 and 1.2% of GDP in FY 2019. Assuming the economy is at full employment two years from now doesn't seem particularly unreasonable.
@ylanmui They also say the tax cut would add less than 0.1pp to the annual growth rate over the next decade.
@nkjemisin I would love to convince my wife to read Fifth Season, would be a great first sff for her.
CRFB points out that no serious model of the ACTUAL tax plans (as opposed to hypothetical alternatives) finds growth increases of even 0.1pp, well short of the 0.8pp of added annual growth needed to pay for the bills+associated gimmicks.		https://t.co/fSMmRSvRCD

Way back in July every former CBO head signed a letter "we urge you to maintain and respect the Congress’s decades-long reliance on CBO’s estimates in developing and scoring bills." Is that still their view? Or should we rely on group letters instead? https://t.co/vaLC7or3kY
The most complete dynamic scoring of the Congressional bills finds they would raise the debt by about $1.5T. We need a JCT score before a vote not these sloppy, biased, overoptimistic, partial analyses of different bills than the ones before Congress.
Yet another example of the Seven Deadly Sins of Overly Optimistic Dynamic Scoring. https://t.co/Tx7IJ2wOTI https://t.co/hwj9n1pWoY
Moreover, the GIT differs in at least three important respects from the House/Senate bills: (1) it is fully paid for; (2) it has permanent expensing including structures; and (3) it is a large tax increase on old capital (by disallowing existing depreciation allowances).
But the paper they cite actually finds that output over the next decade would be boosted by 0.1% to 1.9%. And even after 20 years would only be 0.4% to 3.7%. https://t.co/EO5ZzKyosl https://t.co/jFzyiTUxYs
For example, they cite the 2006 Treasury of the Bush tax reform commission to justify a 4.8% GDP effect--implying that this would happen over a decade. https://t.co/ZDmgQ6Y7Bl

@greg_ip @erikbryn @Austan_Goolsbee Tax cuts not an advanced math problem, you can choose the distn you want (for bottom third that requires refundable credits).
@greg_ip @erikbryn @Austan_Goolsbee Are you endorsing John Taylor’s view that MWP caused the Great Recession?
@erikbryn @greg_ip @Austan_Goolsbee Yes (I negotiated that). The payroll tax cut was a compromise because Rs didn’t want refundibilty and we wanted tax cut for all workers.		Even then don’t get point. SS benefits are based on taxable payroll not payroll taxes. And trust fund was held harmless.
@greg_ip @Austan_Goolsbee @erikbryn Not sure I follow @greg_ip’s point. MWP was a refundable tax credit, like the EITC or additional Child Tax Credit. I don’t think anyone experience these as having anything to do with Social Security.

@JBSay @tylercowen I don’t know, but I would bet we have much more passthroughs.
@MichaelRStrain @tylercowen I agree on that. And some shift on deficits justified: interest rates are lower, long-run outlook improved in some respects, and fiscal policy more powerful in recessions.		And I think we overrated the importance of deficits, but not an argument for making them much worse.
@MichaelRStrain @tylercowen To be sure, Dems imperfect too. But that is not the relevant question now. Moreover, $2T (assuming extension) is a pretty large scale compared to the typical Dem proposals.
@MichaelRStrain @tylercowen More importantly, WAY more Republicans have taken a turbocharged version of supply side to justify the claims that tax cuts pay for themselves.		Go to the Hill and ask Dems if because of secular stagnation we should not pay for proposals.

@tylercowen I think you overrate one economist’s arguments and underrate how invested much of the Democratic Party has been in statutory PAYGO which became law in 2009. (Not that they have been perfect, just say you underrate it.)		Obama’s infra plan, for example, was paid for.
@tylercowen Also, referring to motives of donors does seem like an reasonable factor in evaluating the estate tax cut, at the very least.
@tylercowen Seems like arguments like largest tax cut in history, 3% growth and Estate taxes hit family farms are more consequential.		And most progressive arguments have been about the plan as a whole which is, indeed, costly and regressive—especially counting the incidence of financing.
@yeselson You mean the 46% of GDP they raise in revenue including a 56% top income tax rate and 25% VAT? Yeah, I guess a bit different than the tax system post TCJA.
@tylercowen Sorry, I misunderstood your position. Maybe be clearer that you support the Obama/Lew/Summers/Furman plan not the Trump/Ryan/McConnell one.
Sweden is also fully paying for its corporate rate cut entirely with corporate raisers and no dynamic scoring, even though it has a budget surplus of 1% of GDP and 46% debt to GDP ratio.		Next argument for a 1% of GDP tax cut that raises marginal rates on new capital? https://t.co/4lK6AQDK6I

How to fix bill to improve growth/distn:		1. 28% corp rate	2. Drop passthrough loophole	3. Retain estate tax	4. Reverse SALT (income not property deductible)	5. Permanent expensing	6. Eliminate interest dedn	7. Family credit permanent	8. Child credit refundable	9. Childless EITC

I would love to see Treasury and JCT scores of these provisions—and the House plan—as they also have comprehensive models.
With the better-designed plan you get modest GDP/wage increases, although still costs in the first decade. https://t.co/XmzOeiWYBw
PWBM of a better-designed plan (20% rate cut plus expensing, end interest deduction, and base broadening). House plan likely worse.
Under static scoring the debt/GDP rises by 6 pp after 10 years. Slightly worse w/ dynamic scoring—and in optimistic case still rises a lot. https://t.co/H5bYAPDpaf
Dynamic scoring RAISES the cost of the plan from $3.6 to $3.9 trillion over 20 yrs (static/dynamic both $1.5 trillion over the next decade). https://t.co/83hBQ2Vp3h
My guess is GNP/NI falls by more, especially in optimistic case, as we prop up GDP by borrowing from foreigners but then have to repay them.
GDP rises at first and then declines in the base case, down 0.1% at end of next decade and down 0.6% at end of 20 years. https://t.co/1w3eTShpjg

@SethHanlon In fairness, high-income households would not get any EITC increase. Then again, in unfairness, neither would low-income households.
@MichaelRStrain These models capture complexity missing in simple finger exercises (eg, much I expensed already, EMTR up on those when statutory rate down).
@MichaelRStrain I don’t know and Kent not on Twitter so he can’t weigh in. But medium/long results similar to past Treasury/JCT.
@aparnamath Agree. But: (1) corporate reform can also lead to lower wages and (2) the magnitudes do matter, especially if evaluating Laffer claims.
@MichaelRStrain Debt weighs on the economy increasingly over time. Not sure what to make of jump in first yr, OLG models not designed to answer very SR Qs

@ernietedeschi This one could be more detail dependent on actual leg language than, say, raising child credit from $1,000 to $2,000.
@ernietedeschi I was doing corporate. But you're right, surprisingly positive (still small magnitude). Only one that is.
@MichaelRStrain @aparnamath @taxfoundation Now PWBM confirms what I said in my initial reaction: key debate is sign not magnitude. Poorly designed corporate reform can LOWER wages.
But Lazear, Kotlikoff, @MichaelRStrain, @aparnamath, @taxfoundation, Mankiw toy example all below CEA’s “very conservative” lower bound.
We don’t know the House plan so none of this is modelling the House plan yet. Different models will give different answers.
House plan likely much less well designed: maybe temporary/more limited expensing, maintain some interest deduction, &amp; less base broadening.
Here is what it looks like assuming paid for with sensible/permanent design, modest wage increases in most scenarios. https://t.co/Zs4I8iKYhR
The +$1,000 case assumes the United States is a small open economy with complete capital mobility and no supernormal returns, FWIW.
Here is what it looks like for the 20% rate cut. The default case is a wage decline but could be plus or minus ~$1,000. https://t.co/VkCwY6sIiE
I am showing all of the results for every combination of parameters in the PWBM—with a thicker line for their default assumptions.
For comparability to CEA’s “very conservative” $4,000 I am showing the %age change in labor income applied to 2016 household wages.
(2) Cut corp rate to 20%, has permanent expensing, disallows interest deductions, and broadens the base—House plan likely less pro-growth.
I am looking at two plans. (1) Cut in the corporate rate to 20% without other changes, which is what CEA modeled.
Penn-Wharton Budget Model is the most sophisticated dynamic model outside of government, run by Kent Smetters (former Bush admin). https://t.co/I2myQP8OaZ
Under the default parameters cutting the corporate rate LOWERS wages. A well-designed plan a modest positive. You can try your own options.

@ScottElliotG @vicfleischer @sahilkapur @NKaeding Does the Tax Foundation’s TAG model treat eliminating SALT for State/local income taxes as a marginal rate increase on labor?
@ScottElliotG @vicfleischer @sahilkapur @NKaeding Should private school tuition be tax deductible too? Or college tuition (I realize that is tax advantaged now)? But you make a good point.
@GlobeHorowitz Arguably property taxes have an income elasticity less than one (although I’m skeptical), but clearly state/local income taxes do not.
@GlobeHorowitz To explain #2, 28% tax on 89% of your income = a 25% tax on 100% of your income. So no work incentives from base broadening, rate lowering.
@GlobeHorowitz The argument for eliminating property is stronger in 2 ways: (1) much closer to local consumption and (2) MIGHT lower marginal rates.
@GlobeHorowitz The article says in a compromise they will retain the dedn for property taxes and eliminate for State/local income taxes.
Property taxes closer to funding personal consumption than income taxes, this compromise gets it backward. https://t.co/pCa0U5D3f0
@jm0rt Genuine question: what is the evidence on causing higher State taxes for bottom 30%? And do they even pay much State income/prop tax?
For the SALT repeal tax twitter caucus: do you disagree with my analytic statement about the bottom 30% ceteris paribus?
But I think it most likely that the bottom 30% would be better off with SALT+higher rates than no SALT+lower rates, ceteris paribus.
If we could replace SALT with even $200b of well-targeted preschool or anything else I would be thrilled.
"Repealing SALT raises taxes" is not a good argument because it ignores other changes &amp; status quo bias that undermines sensible reforms.
SALT is a dumb way to get support for the bottom 30% of households. But cutting top rates is even less effective.
@FreequentFlyr Absolutely should discuss individual provisions of tax reform. Just not in distributional terms--many other important considerations.
Wonderful, congrats! https://t.co/wmFDz2LWud
@MichaelRStrain @WhiteHouseCEA Consistent with the old CEA--had that in multiple ERPs/speeches. An argument for well-designed, revenue neutral business tax reform. https://t.co/DKO5kLgDQH
But both arguments irrelevant since the package also changes rates etc. Q is impact of the full package. My guess: regressive. We'll see.
Those claiming SALT/401(k) are middle-class tax increases are more wrong than those claiming they are about high-income tax increases.
Public policy 101: The distributional impact of individual provisions of a larger bill is irrelevant. All that matters is the full package.
@rokumar1918 Specifically, voluntary Roth conversions. People would only do if they gained in NPV, so a tax cut. But raised money in the budget window.
@rokumar1918 We wanted 50% spending cuts &amp; 50% tax increases. Republicans wanted 100% spending cuts. The compromise: 50% spending cuts and 50% tax CUTS.
@rokumar1918 In early January 2013 we had a deal on the entire fiscal cliff except how to pay for $20b in sequester relief.
In 8 years of fiscal negotiations the most galling compromise I was involved with was over Rothification, getting PTSD now (cc @rokumar1918)

@caseybmulligan @paulkrugman @delong I am willing to go out on a limb and argue corp tax better than lump sum for middle class. Paul Ryan had the same position 6 months ago.
@caseybmulligan @paulkrugman @delong Middle-class cares about their AFTER-TAX wages, not their BEFORE-TAX wages. Need to know how they are affected by financing. My toy example: https://t.co/Fz9b7CJk5v
@caseybmulligan @paulkrugman @delong In particular, the debate has really missed the financing issue. With a representative agent lump sum taxes better than distortionary.
@caseybmulligan @paulkrugman @delong Real issues are: (1) transition (2) distribution, (3) financing, (4) Δ interest rate, (5) effective marginal rates &amp; (6) supernormal returns
@caseybmulligan @paulkrugman @delong Not seeing the math error. Mankiw said static. His soln is right for static (defined as unchanged base). And dynamic version is higher.
@Noahpinion @AlanMCole It’s the right algebraic answer to the well-defined question he poses—which is static. The interpretation is where he goes awry.

@WSJopinion I really do wish we had such a plan. But as of now the Unified Framework does not come close.
@WSJopinion The macro perspective shifts the debate back to the question of how to design a tax plan that will raise growth and not shift burdens.
@WSJopinion 2 important reasons to believe negative is plausible/likely: (1) deficits/crowd out/lower growth and (2) eventual cost of paying for plan.
@WSJopinion The more important debate is whether the macro impact of this plan on after-tax wages is positive or negative for most households.
@WSJopinion That opens up a debate about the macro impact of the tax plan. No one has defended the CEA's numerical claim of $4K-$9K.
@WSJopinion So Republicans are arguing that their tax plan will have INDIRECT effects for middle class through the corporate tax reduction.
@WSJopinion Also the model cited by CEA won't help here: "cuts in personal income tax rates... lower long-run economic welfare" https://t.co/MFgtwhdNFH

@AlanMCole Matters more for GDP than for GNP/National Income. We care about the later. Your old employer and current school should report them too.
@AlanMCole I'm assuming you disagree with the 10% of the tweets which are qualifications to the argument.
@caseybmulligan I hope we have time for that complete assessment.
@caseybmulligan A full(er) specified plan will allow a more complete assessment of the growth/distn/welfare aspects of the plan together.
@caseybmulligan Part of the problem here is that Unified Framework is incomplete (legislation will also be incomplete by not specifying future financing).
@caseybmulligan CONCLUSION. A lot of ways to look at impact of corp cut on middle class. None of them show middle-class families WAY better off.
@caseybmulligan In practice, maybe some of the extra rents shared with workers in a bargaining model. But not much and likely higher-income workers.
@caseybmulligan In theory cutting taxes on rents will lead to higher after-tax profit but not anything else (“you get what you get and you don’t get upset”)
@caseybmulligan The deleted Treasury study estimated that 63% of corp income is rents—and some evidence rents are rising as concentration grows.
@caseybmulligan SUPERNORMAL RETURNS. The Ramsey model only has normal/competitive returns to capital. The real world also has supernormal returns/rents.
@caseybmulligan I know, State taxes, possibility that avg rates affect lumpy location decisions, etc. It is complicated. Point is simple model overstates.
@caseybmulligan If you have expensing and no interest deduction then cutting statutory rates does not reduce the EMTR at all.
@caseybmulligan This is one reason why full-scale dynamic analysis of rate cuts with Ramsey models are so much smaller than these toy examples would suggest
@caseybmulligan Cutting corp rate from 35% to 20% would cut the Effective Marginal Tax Rate by ~5pp give or take a lot
@caseybmulligan EFFECTIVE MARGINAL RATES. Much investment is already debt-financed. It faces an effective rate ~0%. https://t.co/ajtVAgzf9R
@caseybmulligan I am very comfortable with those assumptions. I suspect you are too. Enough said.
@caseybmulligan INTEREST RATES. The above assumed that the US is not a small open economy &amp; interest rate not the invariant social rate of time preference.
@caseybmulligan You can get different results in different models, is sensitive to when/how financed, but generally cuts or reverses growth effect.
@caseybmulligan See, eg, the Penn-Wharton Budget Model of the President’s earlier principles (they have not updated for new plan). https://t.co/ouxggDYyLn
@caseybmulligan The Unified Framework has deficit financing. Over time this reduces National Income—through less investment or more foreign borrowing.
@caseybmulligan FINANCING. Of course the Unified Framework does not have the $1,600 per hh lump sum financing. So it doesn't have the growth effect either.
@caseybmulligan Other models CEA has been pointing to also assume lump sum/other financing—but somehow only TPC gets attacked for filling in details. https://t.co/84JkJv2fjw
@caseybmulligan Broader point: in model growth comes from replacing distortionary taxes with lump sums. Can't ignore when evaluating middle class impact.
@caseybmulligan A household making $50,000 and no capital ownership gets a $1,500 wage boost and a $1,600 tax increase—or $100 worse off.
@caseybmulligan The means wages +3% (or $2,000—already below CEA but nevermind). But implicit in model is lump sum financing of $1,600/household.
@caseybmulligan DISTRIBUTION. POTUS claim is middle-class better off. Stipulate Greg Mankiw’s toy example is right: $200b corp tax cut, $300b wage increase.
@caseybmulligan TRANSITION: May take a long time to get to the new steady state level. Is relevant because direct changes are sooner, matter more in PV.
@caseybmulligan Ramsey ignores: (1) transition (2) distribution, (3) financing, (4) Δ interest rate, (5) effective marginal rates &amp; (6) supernormal returns.
I love the Ramsey model as much as the next person (OK, not as much as Greg or @caseybmulligan) but it has major limitations for this q.

@GlobeHorowitz See below, same story, rate cutters like Ireland and Poland saw larger erosion of wage share. https://t.co/VyKHCDWaEv
There is a large literature on changes in the labor share. To my knowledge none of it finds high corporate rates lead to a falling share.
CEA's chart of wages growing faster in low corporate tax countries is entirely about Eastern European countries. Not exactly applicable.
If anything the relationship is the opposite: Ireland had a low corporate rate and falling labor share while in France the opposite.
I see no evidence for the CEA's rather novel claim that high corporate tax rates drive a disconnect of profits/wages. See this chart. https://t.co/rvSKOYzcFl
I assume by "ridiculous" you are referring to my 250% number being way off. https://t.co/zeeDaPtfEB
Poorly designed, temporary, deficit-financed tax cuts have been consistently shown to reduce growth which will lower wages, not raise them.
The $4,000 claim is not based on the corporate tax being shifted to labor. It is a claim about economic growth.
$4,000/household * 125 million households = $500b	Annual cost of corporate rate reduction = $200b		% of corporate tax paid by labor = 250%
The economic debate about the %age of the corporate tax paid by labor ranges from 0% to 100%. The new CEA study puts it at 250%.

@MarcGoldwein @kpomerleau If the total tax cut envelope is $1.5T then not repealing SALT also means not doing another $1.3T in gross tax cuts. They rise/fall together
@MarcGoldwein @kpomerleau Repealing SALT may be good policy (my tweets were agnostic on that). But not because it raises revenue from high-income people.
@MarcGoldwein You want to make more to buy more stuff--housing high on the list. So raising the price of the stuff raises EMTRs.
@MarcGoldwein That is what CBO does with its modeling of EMTRs, they ask the income elasticity. The question is why do you want to make more money?
@MarcGoldwein @kpomerleau You love plagues on all your houses!!! No equivalence here. You can support more revenue/progressivity &amp; argue 25 better ways to get it.
@MarcGoldwein There is a much easier way to reduce other distorting tax preferences but they are not doing it.
@MarcGoldwein My guess is property taxes also have an income elasticity of ~1--what do people buy when their income goes up? So does not help with EMTR.
@MarcGoldwein This repeats the distributional confusion. The 35% rate also goes only to people with higher incomes.
@MarcGoldwein @kpomerleau I wasn't advocating for or against repealing SALT, just that most of the arguments made for repeal are weak.
@MarcGoldwein @kpomerleau Progressive opponents of SALT also oppose the rate cuts. Your gotcha on deficit/distn irrelevant to their argument.
@MarcGoldwein @kpomerleau @TaxPolicyCenter That is the right debate to have. Not one that assumes that rates must come down and then looks for payfors to make that work. END
@MarcGoldwein @kpomerleau @TaxPolicyCenter But you could also argue that redistribution &amp; investment will be underprovided &amp; collective action problems will generate suboptimal rates.
@MarcGoldwein @kpomerleau @TaxPolicyCenter If you think State and local taxes are primarily about suburban parks &amp; swimming pools then might argue that this is a lot like consumption.
@MarcGoldwein @kpomerleau @TaxPolicyCenter Your view on whether that is a good or bad thing depends in part on your view of those public goods.
@MarcGoldwein @kpomerleau @TaxPolicyCenter The main argument for repeal of SALT is that it distorts consumption towards public goods and away from private goods.
@MarcGoldwein @kpomerleau @TaxPolicyCenter With SALT might pay 39.6% rate but on only 88% of your income. With reform is 35% rate on 100% of your income. Same rate, no Δ labor/income.
@MarcGoldwein @kpomerleau @TaxPolicyCenter Why might this be a good idea? The canonical lower rates / broader base argument does not apply because the income elasticity of SALT is ~1.
@MarcGoldwein @kpomerleau According to @TaxPolicyCenter the 12/25/35 rates cost $1.2 trillion &amp; eliminating SALT raises is $1.3 trillion. https://t.co/8325XSVBTZ
@MarcGoldwein @kpomerleau In this case the right analytical &amp; relevant political questions are the same: better to have current system or lower rates with no SALT.
@MarcGoldwein @kpomerleau Progressivity is an irrelevant consideration for individual elements of a tax reform plan, only should focus on the distn of the full plan.
Much of the defense of repealing the State &amp; Local Dedn (SALT), including by the rarely illogical @MarcGoldwein @kpomerleau, is off. Thread:

My bad, reading too quickly. BFI of 5.2% was very strong and encouraging. But overall fixed investment dragged down by -6.8% in residential.
Gross Domestic Output is a more accurate measure of growth. It was revised up for 2014&amp;15 but revised down from 1.6% to 1.2% in 2016 Q4/Q4.
Output data revisions for 2014/15/16 on average are small. But the slowdown in GDO is much more pronounced in the revised data. https://t.co/rzmiLzRxgR
But would have rather seen a composition tilted towards investment instead of consumption.
GDP growth of 2.6% in Q2 means the first half continues trend potential ~2%. PDFP tells the same story at 2.7% in Q2.
ECI up 0.5 pp in Q2, a little below expectations. 2.4% growth yr/yr is a smidge above recent performance. Rorschach Test for hawks/doves.

@D_Blanchflower Short version, I think a combo of declining demand &amp; lack of supportive labor market institutions explain age-adjusted prime age men.
@D_Blanchflower Blog was not an attempt at an explanation--just quantifying one aspect. My explanation for prime age men here. https://t.co/pfcZM1PXvm
My personal hunch is that there is little/no slack left. But would continue to test the proposition, especially given sluggish wage growth.
Does not answer broader question of remaining slack, which also depends on:	1. 2007:Q4 cyclical position	2. non-aging trends	3. hysteresis
Overall, the employment-population ratio is closer to its pre-recession value, with all but 0.4 pp of the 2.7 pp decline explained by aging. https://t.co/WLH2QpSwSO
This is generally consistent with—but more moderate than—the 2001-07 experience, except for prime age men which is worse than then. https://t.co/RKd8gGLUz6
The age-adjusted decline in LFPR is due to youth and prime age men. Prime age women roughly flat and older workers' participation has risen. https://t.co/LIecW1ST6L
The aging US population explains 2.5 pp of the decline, or 79%. But even adjusting for age, 1.7 million people missing from the labor force. https://t.co/3hnU2wXsKk

@ConcordC For now, I would be fine with not making the problem worse. And using SS &amp; Medicare solvency as a scorecard to motivate future action.
@ConcordC This framework is based on existing agreements, is feasible, agnostic on size/scope of govt, allows stages, and adjusts for uncertainty. https://t.co/YbYUgKEGgO
@ConcordC For SS and Medicare solvency, can do in stages over time. For Medicare this allows learning. Could do with revenue and/or spending.
@ConcordC Need not be done all at once. Could do no harm on PAYGO (I would pay for sequester relief with mandatory savings and revenue).
@ConcordC Would go from a fiscal gap to a fiscal surplus if we restored solvency for Social Security and Medicare. https://t.co/0aL7vQ0eG1
@ConcordC 75-yr fiscal gap is 0.3% of GDP on Trustees assumptions or 2.3% on CBO (tax increase/spend cut needed to stabilize debt). If we keep PAYGO.
@ConcordC My framework for solving our fiscal problems is two simple steps: (1) PAYGO and (2) restore Social Security and Medicare HI solvency.

@ConcordC If you wanted to get back to the revenue/spending levels called for by Bowles-Simpson you need to call for a $6-10 trillion tax increase! https://t.co/3PB9jV6nGf
@ConcordC This is because revenue is well below what Bowles-Simpson called for. Spending about the same (depends on methodology). https://t.co/Zv6pdvddZP

GDP has residual seasonality. But GDI, another way of measuring the same concept, does not. And at 1.0% in Q1 it was quite low.

Less than thrilled with 0.2% wage growth (2.5% y/y). But is ~1% real wage growth. Which is, unfortunately, higher than productivity growth.

@esoltas Agree, no idea what natural rate is, all for pushing. But unlike some others I am not confident we are above it--best guess would be not.
But the history of GOP-only mandatory savings is not encouraging, see the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. Nor is it desirable policy.

@EricaGroshen Here is a comparison to 2 yrs pre-recession (all plausibly stationary indicators, unlike LFPR and EPOP). Part-time best case for slack. https://t.co/9MJw3JCOaK
@EricaGroshen They're all above Dec 2007 levels but at/below the average in the years before 2007 which might be a better guide. Plus U6 below Dec 2007.
@ernietedeschi By this metric there was run room almost every year for the last sixty years. Could draw the same chart in 1980 or 1990 or 2000.
@ernietedeschi Unfortunately that is what we would expect with productivity growth ~0.5%. The labor share has been rising. That is good &amp; should have more.
@DavidBeckworth I think that is largely a combo of demography and structural trends. But some overshooting could help address it. https://t.co/tYjGMumGWU
@mpshapiro Unfortunately that chart suggests it is primarily structural. In 2000 prime age male EPOP still had not recovered from 1991 recession also.
A yr ago I expected job growth to slow and wage growth to rise. The opposite is surprising. A worrying possibility: low productivity growth. https://t.co/U4P2IYqIBD
Is there any argument left for labor market slack? I see a case for overshooting on inflation but not one that we can avoid the tradeoff.
I really loved doing this interview with my favorite economics podcast. @CardiffGarcia https://t.co/MGKLcSpOQZ
Best news in report: U6 down 0.3pp to 8.6%		Decent news in report: wages up 0.3%		Biggest concern: LFPR down 0.1pp
First item I'll be looking at in jobs report: wages. It's what matters for the 150m with jobs already.
@MarcGoldwein Deficit-financed infrastructure is false equivalence: (1) Obama proposal was paid for and (2) zero chance of trillions on infra, unlike tax.
@MarcGoldwein That's what you think they'll do with the instruction? At the same time they are cutting taxes by more than $500b?

Final word on Q1 GDP: PDFP provides the most stable signal of future. Adds C + I, omits volatile inventories/NX/G. Up a healthy 2.2% in Q1.
If Q2 comes in at its current track of 3.8% (a big if) then the first 1/2 of this yr will--once again--be normal. So stop hyperventilating.
Best news: 9.4% growth in nonres investment, best since 2013, key to productivity		Worst news: 0.3% growth in consumption, key to SR growth

@greg_ip @kpomerleau Why should it affect deltas? If Fed thinks 50 bps of fiscal stimulus from tax cuts then why not 50 bps higher rates, regardless of r*?
@kpomerleau @greg_ip When markets expected more stimulus post election the 10yr rose ~75 bps. Levels lower but deltas still respond to demand changes.
What matters is if we're at a corner solution or not. Right now FFR&gt;0, Fed tightening, would raise faster/further with $7T deficit increase. https://t.co/rMUGdZIUS2
Remember all the work to come up with and present detailed health savings in Feb 2009? @porszag @KennethBaer @davidckamin @genebsperling
Tables from budget on 2/28/09. Very detailed $662b in health spending. "Benefits not yet determined" costed at "TBD" https://t.co/XOfTZYjsle https://t.co/lvF3O3u4oy
Trump approach on taxes opposite of Obama on health. Budget released 2/28/09 included $634b of health savings but not explicit spending.
Keep in mind the Penn-Wharton model is careful/transparent and overseen by Kent Smetters--an expert who happens to be former Bush admin.
This is because the cost of the $7T in added deficits (again, after dynamic scoring) outweighs any benefits from lower tax rates.

@Justin_Vogt @mattyglesias Passthrough rate of 15% is de facto individual rate cut.
@Justin_Vogt @mattyglesias I guess you're not counting the fact that a 15% tax rate cuts the value of the mortgage deduction by nearly two-thirds?
@mattyglesias Seems to be: (1) untaxed imputed rent, (2) deductible property taxes, and (3) unstated and likely not robust assumptions. https://t.co/Vf7aTBTFAi
@mattyglesias Sorry, you wrote equity. That is  weird--previous CBO &amp;Treasury versions of this table did not break out debt/equity, had not focused on it.
@mattyglesias Mortgage interest deduction. Probably leads to a bigger misallocation of capital than anything we worry about in traditional biz tax reform.
Reminder: rate is generally lower for passthroughs than for C corps (some C income pays cap gains/dividends too). https://t.co/0v2ovt7ZZp https://t.co/gyifxyDMJK
With a 15% rate on passthroughs hedge funds will lobby for carried interest repeal so they are not stuck paying the higher cap gains rate.

@taliesinSF That would not come close to offsetting. Capital gains are a voluntary tax--raise the rate a lot and people won't pay it. Need accrual tax.
@johnvmcdonnell @rortybomb Shifting from corp to individual level tax requires taxing accrued capital gains and nonprofits. Nice idea, but not sure is for this planet.
@johnvmcdonnell @rortybomb Mnuchin Rule is not net tax cut for rich. So even if all corporate tax incidence is labor that would still violate it.

@KenGardner11 Real wages were up about 1% annually in last several years. That is nearly 20x the pace from 1981 to 2007.
Some divergence. All workers wages +2.7% while excluding managers is only +2.3%. Could be more wage inequality after previous narrowing. https://t.co/QJ7Oxr5Ygr
A high-frequency indicator of inequality is wages for private vs. production and nonsupervisory wages. Later excludes higher-paid managers.
RT @JedKolko: Wow -- not only is prime-age EPOP up to 78.5%, but U-6 down to 8.9%
Large drops in unemployment for job losers and reentrants; for people unemployed less than 5 weeks and more than 27 weeks.
With U6 at 8.9% the case for remaining slack is considerably weaker. But given the surprising resilience of LFPR, more may be possible.
Of course the jobs number is below expectations (and a good reminder not to overweight ADP). But most have jobs--so focus on wages.
Biggest disappointment is avg hourly earnings of 2.7% over last yr. But U6 of 8.9% and LFPR still at 63.0% is quite good.
My wish list (in order):		1. 2.9% wage growth over 12 months		2. U6 down to 9.0% (below pre-recession average)		3. LFPR steady at 63.0%

Consumption growth at 3.5% in Q4 is central to U.S. economy--confident consumers with real wage increases spending it.
The fact that consumption + fixed investment (PDFP) grew 3.4% in Q4 is indicative of momentum as it excludes the more volatile components.

@jbarro Except, of course, the process is may be allowing them to hide the policy problems.
@jbarro This is excellent (unsurprisingly). And a good argument that the real issue with EHB is the major policy problems, not the process.

@BobFoolery @paulkrugman I am looking at the supply side, so key is growth of the workforce. GDP = workers * (output/worker)

(iii) But, generally not worth making large distributional or welfare sacrifices for a little extra growth.
(ii) All else equal we should do everything we can for growth, over time a few tenths of a percentage point add up.

Productivity slowdown has happened in all the advanced economies—which makes it unlikely to be caused by, say, the ACA https://t.co/oXLq4hMFrZ
Growth under these scenarios from 1.4% to 3.2%. But for the later would need unusually high increases in participation and productivity.
Productivity is even more uncertain, I look at three cases there too. Notably even the Pessimistic Case is much faster than recent growth https://t.co/Yj69piJu8g

With UR below 5% little room left for cyclical boost, so over next decade growth has to come from potential https://t.co/gur4RXV172

@ModeledBehavior @rortybomb Not arguing shadow tightness. Just less slack. You disagree?
@ModeledBehavior @rortybomb My point is LESS slack outside of U3 than 1 or 2 yrs ago, so LESS downward pressure on inflation now.
@JayCShambaugh Good point, but should the Fed be looking through that to some degree? And financial conditions overall flat as equities up.
@ModeledBehavior @rortybomb I'm not super worried about inflation rising to 4%+, but would not be complacent about costs of bring back down.
@ModeledBehavior @rortybomb U6 not a good argument here, has fallen from 17% to 9%. I believe still shows slack, but a lot less than before.
I am less worried about signals on # more hikes this year. Fed is data dependent so hikes will respond to/offset economy not drive it.
But it also means high Sacrifice Ratio (point yrs of UR needed to reduce infl). Should avoid pain of bringing inflation back down to target.
Monetary policy has a 1-2 yr lag. And while the flat Phillips curve has allowed lower unemployment with little increase in inflation...
I think we should be much more worried about insufficient wage growth than excessive inflation. But inflation is 2% and may be rising.
Today’s but all but inevitable hike means policy will still be expansionary, just a little less so. (Remember in late 1990s was 5+ percent).

To get a sense about how the reduced actuarial value can affect deductibles see from @KaiserFamFound https://t.co/wlvEHN1vC5 https://t.co/RP4AOiCJsi
@sarahkliff And that is after their deductible up by roughly $4,000!
CBO illustrative example has Actuarial Value of the plan going down from 87% to 65%. That is roughly $4,000 higher deductible. https://t.co/IHiwVPKkos
@DLeonhardt @jzettelmeyer should stop worrying so much about Greek debt relief and answer this simple question.
@haroldpollack Don't forget that even after the extra $12,900 in premiums they get a plan that covers much less (AV of 65 instead of 87).
10% premium savings in LR ≠ 10% less cost.		CBO says deductibles/cost sharing rises and subsidies fall.
@paulkrugman Treasury has a good model too. If the Admin doesn't like these estimates they should release their career staff estimates.

$592b in tax cuts, much for high-income	$673b in repealed marketplace subsidies	$880b in Medicaid cuts		Only $361b in new tax credits
@C_Garthwaite @sangerkatz and dynamic score of this one likely even smaller because it has tax credits instead of full repeal.

To be clear: 0.2 pp on growth would be great. But basing the policy on unrealistic forecasts likely means deficits and lower growth.
The Administration says it is working on a tax plan. So 3+ growth projection is not "dynamic scoring" of a plan, it is "directed scoring".
This is what dynamic scoring/analysis looks like. The "GIT" is DBCFT. And it adds 0.01 to 0.2 pp to growth (ar) https://t.co/EO5ZzKyosl
"Dynamic scoring" starts with a policy and then models the growth impact. "Directed scoring" starts with politicians dictating a growth rate
The GDP growth damage from the President's immigration policies swamp plausible estimates of the benefits of tax reform.
Auerbach et al in AER found a flat tax would add 0.05 pp to the growth rate over the decade. So 2.05% growth rate. https://t.co/gwn7OZCIWD
Assuming potential growth is 2.0 percent (above the CBO estimate), then DBCFT would raise the growth rate to between 2.01 and 2.2 percent.

Evidently having a CEA Chair is also not necessary or sufficient. https://t.co/olNKUfymjU https://t.co/hiGdHSWLZ4
Christy Romer was announced jointly with Tim Geithner and Larry Summers in November 2008--signaling a team approach. Very different now.
More important: do they pick a strong person and fully incorporate them in decision making.
CEA delisted from Cabinet: the rank is not necessary nor sufficient for influence. But is a bad signal about POTUS's regard for substance.

This removes the factual barrier to asserting the longest private sector jobs streak in history, 83 straight months.
Was flying so late to jobs day, but twitter was distracted by the 1/2017 number &amp; missed prvt 5/2016 was revised from -1K to 17K.
I would add: impt to be a key team member. Obama announced Geithner, Summers and Romer together in 11/2008. So a little behind on that one.

@kpomerleau @nick_bunker certainly would not work in PDV. And once you are only taxing rents/luck, why would you want to cut the rate?
@kpomerleau @nick_bunker Adjustment is 1-(1/(1-t)), I assumed a more realistic 25% rate so a 33% adjustment. @ 20% rate would be 25% adjust.

@kpomerleau @RichardRubinDC Not a Byrd expert think indefinite. But CBO provides limited outyear scores-and need be positive for all of them
@RichardRubinDC And 1 time repatriation tax cuts the same way. On balance, I expect more SR payfors than LR payfors, so NPV revenue losing.
And this: https://t.co/lzpakg40OR
Squawking this morning, it is hard to be intelligent about GDP numbers w/o seeing them, but I will eventually adjust https://t.co/oRkUev7Urp
@RichardRubinDC If border tax is infinite horizon revenue neutral, then a plan that uses it as a 10yr payfor will raise the LR deficit.

@MartinSGaynor agree, my motivations for antitrust would be innovation, price, inequality. Not the current practice of price, price, price.
@MartinSGaynor Of course it won't solve inequality, but many causes require many solutions. Also "competition" is more than just antitrust.
@superwuster certainly argued for that @Econ_Marshall @MauriceStucke
