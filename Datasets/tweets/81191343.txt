We have too many young people being trapped in poverty because other people are defining them with low expectations.
I want to speak to the future leaders of America. Don't let anyone define you but you. You have a responsibility to be yourself. Be proud.
Our values and our issues are central. The most important things we have to offer are on the inside. This is the testament to progress made
We are thankful for those trailblazers who came before us and said the status quo was not enough. I stand on the shoulders of giants.
In South Carolina, in America, it takes a generation to go from having a grandfather who is picking cotton, to a grandson in Congress.
My skin color is talked about often. Tonight I want to talk about it for just a moment.
If we do what we're supposed to do, that is serve people, then our world will be better. Our nation will be better.
I want to make sure the greatest workforce in the history of man, the American workforce, has the skills to succeed.
If we are going to compete, we cannot allow the zip code you live in to determine the quality of your school.We need innovation in education
Thank you South Carolina, your support is absolutely incredible. http://t.co/SrUGBcqxbZ
