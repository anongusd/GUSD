@timcarman And as long as The Inn continues to be put on "Best Places to Eat in Washington" lists, many will continue to roll their eyes and say"It's not even in DC".
@LauraHayesDC @washingtonian @patowmackfarm And I'm glad to see the "outside the beltway" coverage, but I'm bringing to light what many say when too often outlets include "The Inn" in their "DC lists" when Balitomore is closer. Simply adding "but the drive" is a poor defense. Again, just my 2cents and tweet.
@timcarman All for neighborhood restaurants and would go as far as falls church but a 90min drive is a hard sell to claim as “DC area”. 		That’s almost the same distance from Philadelphia to NYC.
Dear ALL media outlets, STOP adding the Inn at Little Washington in your "Best DC restaurant" lists. It's 90 minutes away by car!! 		Example: https://t.co/JcM5p6Mamd https://t.co/72PhXz4R7w
