@MaryJoh94445574 @MyFairLady007 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Her story is a story of a medical abortion that says the child		Her story is a change in the narrative, its a story of Hope		Oprion: #3		I love that if a mother needs to medically stop the pregnancy or i.e.	 medically abort (end) the pregnancy: the child can be saved		I Love That

@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA Mr. Whitlock	1) Here are a few thoughts and it really comes down to this. Is taking a knee respectful or is it disrespectful? After careful consideration of the facts I've come to the conclusion that taking a knee is the greatest symbol of respect in the course of human history!!
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 2) Taking a knee and standing at attention with your hand over your heart, are both  symbols of respect! both are RESPECTFUL, but the greater symbol of respect is TAKING A KNEE. Taking A Knee Is The GREATEST SYMBOL of RESPECT In The Course of Human History!!
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 3)	Is it disrespectful?  For a former Green Beret Nate Boyer to suggest to Colin Kaepernick to take a knee because it was a symbol of respect for flag and country.
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 4)	Now the norm has been to stand;	And for practical reasons like in a gymnasium full of chairs, or an auditorium full of seats there's often times not room to Take A Knee.
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 5)	I'm a real person, I'm a veteran who served my country in the military.	And I demonstrated respect to my future wife  now 23 years  bye taking a knee when I proposing to her for marriage.
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 6)	The symbol for In God We Trust is George Washington on one knee which was demonstrated by the statue in front of the flag. That statue of George Washington on one knee is a symbol of respect real person or not.
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 7)	The Constitution is there for everybody all the time government and private sector.  And in 1943 the Supreme Court already ruled on this issue.
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 8)	Since In God We Trust as our national motto and it's their 24/7 everyday and and I believe in this so strongly  I had my  name  legally change to LivingForGod AndCountry, for me putting God 1st and taking a knee during the national anthem is the greatest symbol of respect.
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 9)	Taking a knee is the  greatest symbol of respect in the course of human history, From Knights of the Round Table to people that proposed for marriage All Take A Knee! Statues all over our country at  Veteran Cemeterys have soldiers on one knee BECAUSE ITS A SYMBOL OF RESPECT
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 10)	And if it's not disrespectful to TAKE A KNEE  for God "IN GOD WE TRUST IS OUR NATIONAL MOTTO" it can NOT be disrespectful to the Country or Flag
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 11)	Keep in mind this hypocrisy while we sing the words in the national anthem "in the land of the free"... under the Trump presidency, you're not free to take a knee! And then to add insult to injury he says it's disrespectful, IT IS  NOT  DISRESPECTFUL it is a symbol of RESPECT
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 12)	Talking about missing out on a win-win situation Evangelical Christians for years have been trying to have people not criticize them to take a knee publicly... instead of saying "hey I'm going to take a knee PUTTING GOD FIRST and also Ask For Social Justice and equality
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 13)	The country gets split right down the middle because president Trump is not about bringing U.S. together he's about dividing US and winning... winning what? There's nothing to Win. 2.5 million Jehovah's Witnesses and 250,000 Amish don't stand or salute the flag.
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 14)	I'm on the side NOT EMBRACING the policy of greed and bigotry... I'm on the side of compassion and kindness in the spirit of Goodwill understanding and having empathy towards those with different beliefs!
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 15)	President Trump has been promoting this bigotry and saying that it's disrespectful when it actually is a symbol of RESPECT ITS NOT DISRESPECTFULLY &amp; for those reasons I now take a knee or stand against Trump on this issue HE IS  WRONG!
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 16)	The people who want to use the greatest symbol of respect in the course of human history are not insisting that other people take a knee but there are those who are intolerant of other people's points of view insisting that they stand	THE ISSUE Q: IS  IT  RESPECTFUL  A: YES!!
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 17)	Taking a knee and standing at attention with your hand over your heart are both symbols of respect, both are symbols of respect... but the greater symbol of respect is taking a knee.  BECAUSE TAKING A KNEE  IS THE GREATEST SYMBOL OF  RESPECT IN THE COURSE OF  HUMAN HISTORY!!
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 18)	And the NFL does not own the national anthem they do not get to stipulate what happens during the national anthem that is not there right the national anthem is there for everybody in the entire nation.	1943 Supreme Court Ruling!
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 19)	The 1943 Supreme Court ruled that people cannot be punished EVEN  IF THEY ARE AN EMPLOYEE for not participating or standing for the national anthem or the Pledge of Allegiance THAT IS A FACT!	Jehovah's Witnesses cannot be punished for not participating,	Neither can Kaepernick
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 20)	You may choose during the national anthem to never use the greatest symbol of respect in the course of human history by taking a knee, you may choose to stand with your hand over your heart which is also respectful that is your choice!
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 21)	There is a mountain of overwhelming evidence that can prove that taking a knee is respectful...	If anyone anywhere anytime wants to peacefully nonviolently try to make things better by taking a knee or standing for what's right they are a hero in my book!!
@storagemagician @jonaschartock @_KennerLA 22)	This is just a few of the points.	Thank you for sharing your point of view.		Thank you for being respectful!		Thank you for not promoting bigotry on that I greatly salute you!!!
