Can we please start crowdfunding for a bunch of other issues? Wall supporters are raising some dough!
Did Mitch just wake up and miss the last two weeks? This is an issue of failure to work together as a Congress and failure of our elected officials to accomplish their basic tasks. #UnacceptablePolitics https://t.co/kxqzGPhdlN
It‚Äôs amazing how the WH chooses to throw all decorum out the window and then just bash opponents to deflect blame. 		It‚Äôs called Balance of Power..Dems are representing their constituents just like Reps. Maybe sit down and work with them instead? https://t.co/IP0KEnhh36

@JustLuthien You basically are saying that you believe that nobody‚Äôs voice but yours and those who agree with you should be heard. And your defense is to use another undefended argument to yet again just attack the opposite political party from you. #BetterPoliticsPlease
@DeplorableTrump @JustLuthien And yet you use the bully pulpit to stoke conspiracy theory and anger instead of discussing any real facts. Let the recounts take place and advocate for proper investigation before you undermine this country more.
@JustLuthien That argument makes absolutely no sense but it is eye opening to the depth of your thinking.
@JustLuthien That just sounds like suppressing individuals you don‚Äôt agree with...
@SenSchumer It is inappropriate to accuse @FLGovScott of manipulation when there is no evidence to support that. 		Yes, he should recuse himself, but there is no need for this combative language. Chuck, do more than just send mean tweets! #BetterGovernmentPlease
@DiamondandSilk I believe that many representatives in our government on both sides are pushing for these elections to be properly and thoroughly carried out. The media and other sensational individuals are trying to rouse conflict before the election results can be finished and investigated.

@SenFeinstein We need to rely less on court rulings and instead have a Congress willing to work together to fix the #DACA situation! These families and individuals are still living in uncertainty! The American people deserve a government that can create a solution!
