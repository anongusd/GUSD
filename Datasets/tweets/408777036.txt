@XXL Usually the sentencing phase follows the plea phase.  The prosecutors have asked to give him the max 28 years, but I‚Äôve not heard a judge sentence him to that yet.
@BetoORourke cultural appropriation at its finest.  This white man is using a Spanish first name.  Why?  To get Hispanic votes.  He‚Äôs not Hispanic.  He‚Äôs a white liberal culturally appropriating an identity that is not his.  Most white liberals think it‚Äôs ok and do this.
