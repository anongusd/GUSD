@JakeKwon88 I said it many times.  South Korea very big problems are a backward system.  If South Korea population is 63 Million, not 51 Million.  Develop Nation find ways to recycle trash into energy use like Germany and Europe.  It is called planning.
CNN big news is President Trump impeachment.
@freekorea_us POTUS must figure out.  What fuels Dictators mind. Is it there Communist/ Socialist/ backing friends or Isolationist, Power tripping adrenaline mind? For Kim Jung Un I can say. 90 percent old Kim Family followers have him by the balls. 10 Percent including himself is sandwiched
@tokyoreporter The train is not safe in Japan.
@freekorea_us Bolton always has been " Stepping back Hero".  Do not blame me. It wasn't my fault.  I do believe this or that about him.  Are you really sure Bolton??? I do not know it but just coming to my analysis and judgment.
@JChengWSJ Under North Korea law ( Bible, Drug, Stealing) considered a very harsh felony. Plus Otto did not take North Korea seriously because he thought he can get away because of his American.  Why did Otto Warmbier travel to North Korea ( Otto family need to explain to North Korea)!!!
@chadocl Hanoi meeting is called " Cross Checking" meeting. In which Korean culture and custom do not have.  The reason why Koreans are vulnerable to " World Politics".
@GordonGChang Last time I checked.  Kim Jung Un does not work. Only North Korea woman work 24 hours.
@BBCLBicker China Air.  yes.
@JChengWSJ Easy for " Western" media attack North Korea blindfold. It is hard to believe 100 times attack by North Korea.  Again Democrats Fake news.  We know the angle, Human Right issues, Computer Attack, Nuclear Weapon, even though it comes from China Communist Party and NK is 3rd Nation
@BBCLBicker lmao. After period chocolate.  The woman that seeks extra sugar in after a red day.  'Sensitive day' lmao.
@nydia_han @chris_sowers @6abc Look warm and nice.
@tokyoreporter In Korea too. Not only in Japan. Typical Ferrari drivers.  Worst drivers.
@JChengWSJ John Bolton, not your view matters.100 percent agree with you. You fundamentally have a very big problem reading " Dictators" Psychological mind. Just say old Kim Family supporters do not want change because it is them that will lose jobs, power, heads ( 90%) and 10% wants change
@freekorea_us John Bolton has difficulty reading " Dictatorship" mind. 90% of the pressure comes from " Old Kim Family" followers. Meaning rapid change means for them ( Losing lifetime Job, Getting Killed).  10% New Generation want change including Kim Jung Un but his hands are tied. Young!!!
@josungkim 80% Comes from China ( South Korea/ Koreans meaning South Koreans mental fact straight because it does) and 20% ( Korean Peninsula Domestic).
@sungheehwang Get ready for Round 3.  USANK-3
@KasulisK Happy Birthday.

@JChengWSJ @vmsalama @mgordonwsj Both leaders knew what to expect.  More like President Trump telling Kim Jung Un. Let's sign the deal after I get done with Collin situation back in Washington DC.  Round 3 in South Korea, Hawaii, or even Washington DC.  Kim Jung Un was smiling and happy when President left. Okay
@snydersas @davidvolodzko @Forbes No. South Korea is sliding toward 5G and AI together into one.
@DigitalTrends Problem is how about if you cannot get out it.  Blocks of the concrete wall are pilled up.  I just cannot imagine it.  Like your stuck in a coffin.  I would rather die outside of the bed.
@Plaid_SKorea @davidvolodzko 5G plus AI.  But not Digital dictatorship.  Buring North Korea flag does not mean South Korea is becoming a digital dictatorship.

@KloutKiki Nice.
@lisastark351 Awwww, God. LMAO.
@IsabelleDeltore @SexyBabeNetwork Nice.
@freekorea_us I just have this feeling if any war is to happen in the Korean Peninsula it is all going to be Airforce, Navy, and Nuclear Weapon. This is a reason why President Trump is pulling back military exercise. President knows what the next Korean War would be like. No Army involved.
President Trump reveals why Hanoi summit ended without a deal https://t.co/oXZ9KVnND9 via @YouTube Truth always wins.  President Trump is a very smart person. All Korean Media should watch.  The truth.

@lisey_2014 @OCModeling At least you use your fingers.  Not Robot.  That is good and healthy.

@LynnKawano The real enemy was his fellow inmates.  You cannot stop " Inner Demons".
North Korea is facing Fundamental crises.  How can you stop backward thinking nation going forward?  President Trump administration hit this point so many times. Past and Present.
@nknewsorg Round 3 will happen soon.
@oinkorea Top of Mountain free sex place.  We call it " AIDS Paradise".
@BBCNewsAsia Kim Jung Un needs fundamentally change bottom and up. Final Conclusion why Two leaders failed.  Kim Jung Un still thinking about " Kim Family Glory Days".  Those years are gone.
@kristina_wong Secret gas attack.  That is dangerous.
Hello, everyone.  I am back.  Google Chrome had little difficulty starting.  Reboot helps.
@willripleyCNN Did not fell apart.  Both leaders needed more time and have a better deal.  Final Conclusion: President Trump and Kim Jung Un both leaders knew it.  Round 3 is probably needed.  Long process.  Do not think in the fast and short process.  As long China and Russia are watching.
@WWE @MiaYim @QoSBaszler Mia, we love you. Keep fighting.
@koryodynasty The fate of the Korean Peninsula.  South Korea has been living with this fate for past 5,000 Thousand years.  Plus 36 years under Japan Fascist Military rule, 70 years divided North and South.  Unlike the jews. Koreans never left homeland and fled in mass.
@DrMarkPBarry The U.S. economy is based on Military,  North Korea planning to open up and become " Economic" Power.  So Washington DC wants to have dog leash over Kim Jung Un.  Not to move fast.  Let the time decide.  I think South Korea will step in like or not.
@josungkim North Korea no easy way out.  You need to give up all Nuclear Weapon for U.N. sanction to be lifted.  President Trump wants like it or not.  That is the world want.  Smarter and wiser Kim Jung Un change his isolated policy attitude get with the program.
@JChengWSJ @NickBisley Summit 3 will happen soon. Like Always.  Cohen ( Weak backstabbing lawyer) had to make President Trump hard on this summit with North Korea.  I see this all previously planned out from Anti-President Trump Democrats from Washington D.C.  Not North Korea. Final Conclusion. USANK3!
@HallieJackson North Korea officials said before Press. No asking questions.  He's just going to say and leave. Stop pinning North Korea on Human Rights and Otto Warmbier. Stealing is a crime around the world. I hope you report facts correct next time. Display true facts appreciate it. Thank U.
@YonhapNews I wish the " Smarter and Bold International Relations" policy for New Korean Peninsula Policy.  For the past 100 years. The world viewed the " Korean Peninsula" Nation lost in translations.  Not Land of Morning Calm.
@GordonGChang @IngrahamAngle @michellemalkin Not brilliant. President Trump had no choice. Plus Cohen situation did not make President Trump easy.  I wish and hope you report facts honestly Gordon. If you are really against " Communism".
@pchykeen_cho Koreans Fundamentally always have had " Lost in Translation" mentality.  The reason why the Korean Peninsula remains divided.  Korean History is " Lost in Translations" how China, Japan, Mongolia, Russia, even the USA view it.  Sad but it is the truth.
@Mylife_KTV @uni_kr @moonriver365 ShinHanbando.  Seriously needed.  I wish and hope it comes true for all Koreans.
@willripleyCNN Cohen problem was a ghost. It spooked President Trump this time around.  Not Kim Jung Un/ North Korea. It has given two leaders more time.  Round 3 will happen soon. China will tell Kim Jung Un-go back on track to negotiation with the USA.  Worlds want it. Not only USA and NK.
@BBCLBicker Common sense says.  President Trump said to Kim Jung Un lets give little more time and hold off the signing because Domestic crises/ Cohen issue is much more important to me.  How about signing the final in Round 3.  Kim Jung Un probably have said Okay. It gives both leaders time
@samkimasia Keep in mind. North Korea better get on track before President Trump leaves the Train for good. North Korea needs sanction lifted not the USA or the World. I really hope and wish. It is time Kim Jung Un be realistic and remove all nuclear threat.  NK economic power is much wiser!
@JChengWSJ First time.  North Korea officials were true to themselves. No weird-ass/ Punk Ass voice from that Old lady propaganda North Korea media.  That was real.  Summit 3 will happen soon.  NK better catch President Trump before leaves the train for good. The very critical factor here!!
@annafifield Summit Round 3 will happen. North Korea needs more U.S. than another way around. My honest observation.  China also needs the U.S.A.  China will talk to North Korea leader soon. Get back on track.  Once President Trump leaves the train. President Trump will not come back!!!!!!!!!
@JChengWSJ @joshrogin The point here is President Trump going a wonderful place called Washington D.C. but does Washington D.C. wonderful place in America want President Trump.  Now, this is a real threat much more than North Korean Missile crises.  What do you think???
@KasulisK I watched the news last night in Korea.North Korea perspective on Summit. Like always Powerful nations want all Nuclear Threat removed before sanctions whereas Weaker nations will always complain. We tried but they did not accept it angle.  In History always showed Power vs Weak
@JChengWSJ Round 3.  Give Peace a Chance.  The USA and North Korea.
@MetroUK Raccoon, not a Cat.
@EdwardHBOh @JChengWSJ Round 3.  Coming up.
@realDonaldTrump Thank You, President Trump.  President Trump, it was a very smart idea to walk away.  Hope and Wish for Round 3. Give Peace a Chance between the USA and North Korea. Thank you for everything.
@JChengWSJ Kim Jung Un expression WTF.
@chadocl Round 3 is shaping up.  Let's give " Peace a Chance" between the USA and North Korea.
@josungkim @PressSec Round 3 coming up.  This is what it all means.
@willripleyCNN Round 3 is coming up.  President Trump was very smart to walk away.  Do not worry President Trump.  Let's give " Peace a Chance".
@lisastark351 Alisa, President Trump was very smart to walk away.  The ball is in Kim Jung Un court.
@josungkim Round 3 coming up.
@willripleyCNN President Trump was smart to walk away.  The ball is in Kim Jung Un court.  President Trump saying to Kim Jung Un.  If we want to talk de-Nuke, Let's de-Nuke.  Let's stop wasting time and energy.  I see Round 3 coming soon.  Kim Jung Un has no time.
@indy100 Shows President Trump is a very smart businessman.
@samkimasia @nknewsorg President Trump was very smart to walk away from this deal.  Round 3 it is all up to Kim Jung Un ( Nuke vs Economic Development).  If North Korea wants to be prosperous.  They seriously need to give up all Nukes.
@MintaroOba Final Conclusion: Today's Round 2. Both leaders knew what was going to expect.  President Trump and Kim Jung Un.  Kim Jung Un was probably surprised by President Trump shrewd business negotiation skills. His businessman fundamental showed today.  He was very smart.
@willripleyCNN President Trump played his angle correctly. He gave Kim Jung Un a message.  Stop fcking around with Nuke. Get Real. For next time Round 3 negotiation.
@NAR SK Hynix is South Korea Company.

Bee Gees - Wish You Were Here (Lyrics) https://t.co/V7kTaAT1Oz via @YouTube Good song. Hope you like it.
@TomJolly @AshaRangappa_ @nytimes @realDonaldTrump Cohen talking about himself. My honest truth.
@Newsweek Cohen is very " light-hearted" side of the person.  He must have his own reason to speak out.  But you just cannot deny.  Cohen ( Politically as Republican Party Person) supported President Trump.  Cohen like it or not he seems two face person. Very dangerous.
@willripleyCNN Speed isn't the answer because of China and Russia standoff on Trade and Europe/ Nato/ Eastern Europe military standoff.  Building trust between the USA and North Korea is much more important rather than speed.
@DubstepInDPRK @tsaitingi If North Korean does not have this kind of mindset or angle of thinking. A person is not North Korean.  My final conclusion.
@MSNNews Cohen, every word comes out from his mouth. His digging his own grave.
Starbucks Japan Tokyo will open/ will be opening a 32,000 square Store.Reality biggest does not mean the best. Final Conclusion like Tokyo, Shanghai, and New York. Seoul biggest Starbucks probably the best. The reason is you can order, talk, eat, and leave. Biggest means it sucks
@MiekeEoyang Now you know. President Trump is not bowing down to Kim Jung Un. like ( Democrat CNN reports) U.S. News Media. Clearly shows Kim Jung Un is drinking Americano Coffee and waking up to the World reality that surrounds him. No Joke.
@MissMiaKang Mia nobody is perfect. Everybody makes mistakes. It all depends on what kind of mistakes you make. For example, small mistakes or big mistakes. Meaning learning mistake or lifetime mistakes. Rabbit cannot fall in love with the fox.  You know what I mean??????
@ABCWorldNews @DavidMuir What happens to " Thick Lip" in Political World.  Probably the reason why President Trump and Kim Jung Un has one thing in common.  Both leaders have " Thick Lips".  Korean Proverb. Being a Man all depends how thick his lips. When Men speaks it can always backfire on losing trust
@thedailybeast Did Michael Cohen have similar personality while at School??? Korean Proverb. Do not trust or believe the light-hearted person. What happens to " Lips are Sealed" or " Have a thick lip" in political Men arena. People are getting soft.  The reason why President Trump-like Kim J Un
Listening too Bee Gee: Wish you were here.  Good Song. Love Bee Gees. Listen to the music. Hope you like it too.
@KasulisK Koreans do care.  Just North is minority Mafia State. That is a very big difference.  Plus South Koreans do not have time to think about North Korea reason is North Korea does not dictate time for South Koreans way to live. Simply South Koreans are busy!!!!!!! They have a life!!!
@josungkim Kim Jung Un ( Hollywood Smirk) on his face.  He knows what President Trump means.  Final Conclusion.
@KasulisK Hope for the best.  President Trump is only American President trying to get Kim Jung Un/ State/ Straight Path for better enlightenment.
@willripleyCNN Looks cool. Hope for the best.
@nycsouthpaw @JChengWSJ Putting North Korea Axes of Evil list. Did not really help North Korea/ Kim Jung Un did we???? Isolation never helps Isolation state like North Korea. For the past 80 years. North Korea is used to it.  President Trump is playing " Reverse Psychology" meaning North has to open up!
@choonsikyoo Long Line of Defectors.  All part of North Korea 80 years of isolation.  Nothing new.
@joshjonsmith @TheEdwardHowell There is a reason. It takes both sides. Never one side.
@WhiteHouse @JChengWSJ Red, White, and Blue.
@YonhapNews Not dodging.  President Trump said....looking forward means.  His knows going to be long and winding road ahead.  Meaning he can meet Kim Jung Un many times before both agree about the end of war declaration.  President Trump is very smart like Poker Player. He knows how to deal.
@KBSnews President Trump is very Bold Smart Businessman.  He knows the potential especially he knows how to deal with people like Kim Jung Un.   Poker player.  He knows how to deal.
@EdwardHBOh Like watching Creature from Black Lagoon Movie in Black and White.  Now it is in all in color.
@NewDay @jimsciutto NewDay and Jim Sciutto, what this means is.  President Trump wants to keep his mental focus on the meeting with Kim Jung Un.  President Trump does not want his mind distracted.
@NewDay @CNN @joelockhart Sitting next to Godfather of Mafia State.  That I can agree. Now murderous thug???? Hey, Joe Lockhart.  The USA has a full of them.  DO NOT PLAY THAT CHEAP CARD ON KIM JUNG UN/ PRESIDENT TRUMP.  NOT RIGHT!!!!!
@Newsweek I see him as very untrustworthy light-hearted backstabber!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@Jen_Royle @TableBoston Great with pasta.
@FT Samsung.  No words needed.
@HuffPost Reality is not going to help the United States of America has the whole nation.  Like it or not.  The U.S. need President Trump as President.
@willripleyCNN South Korea heard it well......... Truth is.  President Trump is right.  North Korea does have very big, I mean big potential.  Location, Natural Resource, Young force labor, and Discipline to work.  Willing to sacrifice all cost for nations.  North Korea has " Inner Strength"!!!
@ddale8 President Trump and Kim Jung Un ( Road Map to Peace!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) This is World Wide issue.
@JChengWSJ All lined up.
@lisastark351 Tony Stark are you related to Iron Man??? LMAO.  Love Marvel.
@YKreports Pho cost that much????
@carlytron Antman!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! aka Tic Tac.
@bpolitics Kim Jung Un is a Godfather ( Mafia State called North Korea).  Kim Jung Un and President Trump have one thing in common.  Both a bold leader.  Both leaders like " Clear Cut Answer" very " Black and White" view toward the world.

@willripleyCNN Will Ripley, 1) Hanoi has North Korea embassy whereas Da Nang does not.  2) Press office Meeting at same hotel Kim Jung Un staying??? are you crazy. Yeah, I can sure understand Kim Jung Un discomfort. 3) Kim Jung Un made thousand miles trip not to mess up with President Trump.
@willripleyCNN North Korea made no demand.  Hanoi has North Korea Embassy whereas Da Nang does not.  Common sense tells me Kim Jung Un will choose Hanoi over Da Nang.
@laptop_lasane @AOC Like her style.
@nagystephen1 @Sino_NK @nknewsorg @APPSPolicyForum @AsiaPacificFdn @CAGlobalAffairs @Robert_E_Kelly @koreas Kim Jung Un made thousand miles trip. For a good reason. Don't you think?????
@mingkki21 Nice.
@willripleyCNN I really do not think.  Kim Jung Un made thousand trips for nothing.  If CNN thinks in that angle.  You guys must be crazy.
Why does " Edward Oh" wallpaper reminds me " Creature from Black Lagoon".  Fundamentally very creepy picture.  All of you twitter him.  Tell him to remove it.

@OhMyGOFF Cute.
@OhMyGOFF Pretty.
@cnni @cnnsport Like a movie.
@MSNBC Reality is Kim Jung Un said.  He does not want his son to live with Nuclear Missile Threat.  Meaning North Korea only solution is " Economic Development".  I think Kim Jung Un is in 80 percent right path.  Other 20 percent depends on John Bolton and President Trump. Trump Adminst
@VOANews Reminds me 1960's-70's (the even late 80's) South Korea.
@hankookilbo Hope he is serious.  Economic Power is the only way for North Korea and Kim Jung Un.
@chadocl Kim Jung Un coming to Vietnam.
@ccbasher No Anal.  Not real sex.
@eyeamhazzan Lady Gaga looks sexy.
@CNBC @CNBCMakeIt High paying Job in China.  Common sense work for " China Communist Party" aka CCP.
@chadocl I have this instinct.  Kim Jung Un going to use Airplane and Train same time. Even Car is possible.
@BryanDruzin 1) South Korea, 2) India, 3) Germany 4) China, 5) USA, 6) Russia, 7) Great Britain, 8) Israel, 9) Japan, 10) Europe. The previous list from the Video is all outdated and wrong.
@JChengWSJ Vietnam is Communist State wheres North Korea is Mafia State. Plus South Korea boom in Vietnam. I think President Trump and Kim Jung Un is in fair play game field. Plus Vietnam war was very Hot Humid War whereas the Korean War was always labeled as " Cold War" Nobody loses in War
@OhMyGOFF Have a feeling baby is going to be a Genius. Baby understands surrounding just cannot express it verbally. Watch out.  Baby knows..............
@MintaroOba Good point about this is.  Get to see John Bolton true himself.  If it all fails.  The world could blame John Bolton. Isn't that Politicians dirty point.  They love to blame people. Especially " Vulnerable" Politicians.
@OhMyGOFF Wow, sign language. Baby is smart.
@tokyoreporter 7 years ago it was a very popular thing at Yayoi Park 1960's look-alike dancers pick a fight with Freshman University Students. Not dancing with them or Giving them weird ass dirty staredown. These dancers kick college kids in the groin or simply kick there ass. All these wannabe
@JChengWSJ Russian made Missiles, China Communist Party threat using North Korea ( 3rd party).  North Korea did all dirty work to get a direct link with the United States.  The only way for North Korea to get out of Russia and China third-party ghetto life.
@Independent Samsung. I always love Samsung Note and Samsung S10.
@annafifield 1) It takes years for HIV to develop.  2) I remember 7 years ago a story from China.  There was a trend in China that Chinese Herb medicine can stop HIV Virus, Prostate Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer.  Reality Chinese people who had that cancer all died less than 1 year. Be careful!!!
@Israel @IsraelMFA @TeamSpaceIL In Florida or Israel????
Korean Air and Ice Hockey blend well.  South Korea needs fourth professional Ice Hockey Team, for example, Pyeongchang Tiger just ideal name sponsored by Hanjin or Korean Air.  Korean Air company has an Ice Hockey image to it.  People can agree or disagree with.

@willripleyCNN As long U.S. having a bad relations with Russia and China. North Korea diplomacy or having long diplomacy makes sense.  North Korea Missiles are Russians, North Korea threat is coming from " China Communist Party" using North Korea as the third party. Now it all makes sense to me
@ccbasher Did he die??????
@sarahjeong LMAO.
@DavidMaxwell161 Missiles are Russian made, Missile threat is coming from China Communist Party using third party meaning North Korea.  North Korea doing dirty end of the stick because North Korea wants a one-way ticket to the U.S. to get out Russia and China " Ghetto Life".
@ccbasher Football and Cheating are same. It takes one or more people to play and cheat.
@tokyoreporter I can only guess. The patient was a sleep. Pervert doctor has a history.  The reason why Japanese woman sexual molesting age 10-70 years old.  Never stop in Japan. The western nation is a crime whereas in Japan innocent crime.
@ccbasher It takes two people to cheat. Cheating is never one way. It always takes two people. Stop blaming one person.
@annafifield More like North Korea wear.
@koreatimescokr North Korea history begins when North Korea ( Kim Family) was born and ruled.  Ko-Chosun, Korguryo, Balhae, Shilla, Chosun, 36 Japanese Fascist Military Rule. North has no idea. Do not care.
@JChengWSJ @nknewsorg Hitler was Fascist, Lenin was Communist, North ( Kim Family) Juche Mafia State leader.
@tokyoreporter One of those type of guys.
@josungkim Music has no boundary or culture. The reason why Music is such a powerful cultural bridge.
@KasulisK Korea Times ( English Online Newspaper).  They use awkward English expressions like Koasians. Nobody uses. Plus Korean age.  Nobody use.
@RepDavids DNA or Family.  She has been doing it for a long time.
@RepDavids Do not mess with her.  Only thing I can say.
@josungkim Called Kids are growing up to be practical.  No more Doctor, Lawyer, Professor, Businessman. In the Korean standard, they are all corrupt that is the saddest part of all. Do not be surprised if future Doctor, Lawyer, Professor, Businessman will come North Korean descents Koreans!
@Robert_E_Kelly I like Sushi. Why don't you put some wasabi? Abe.
There is an English word called Half Korean. But what the fuck is " Koasians".  No such thing as Koasians like Korean age.  Both fundamental concepts of these two words are all wrong and backward.  Just say Half Korean and Age.
@lisastark351 When we need " Avengers".
@AboveRebroach @josungkim Sad. Two males fighting for a sex partner.  Shows Male testosterone cannot overcome Cold Weather or Males will fight for sex to spread seeds for next generations survival humans and animals are the same.
@freekorea_us King Snake is always needed at the most.
@koreatimescokr How about smoking and spitting on the walking road.
@annafifield Iran and China partnership.  Not big news.  Like Israel and U.S. partnership.
@Robert_E_Kelly President Trump isn't Politicians. He is businessman Human Psychology reading mind following gut feeling plays a bigger role in " Decisions".
@BBCLBicker Winter is the longest Season plus ( Siberia Wind Breeze) months.  It can make Korea weather cold and colder.  Spring, Autumn, Summer is pass bye.
@JChengWSJ @hj257 That is how Fundamentally Capitalist People think but Communist and Fascist people sell " Garbage Propaganda try to brainwash outside of Peripheral regime" Fundamentally, Historically, and Culturally N. Korea has not been doing for past 70 years. We know because South next door
@GordonGChang Koreans do not run to China.  Manchuria wasn't part of China.  Historically and Culturally Manchuria was part of the Korean Peninsula.  The reason why China came running when the Korean War begins.  CCP do not want Korean Manchuria next door meaning Democratic/Capitalist Koreans.
@BBCLBicker Final Conclusion: All North Korea elites are leaving North Korea.
@TheSandraGal Like small puppy.
@KloutKiki Nice.
@koryodynasty I will bet you 99.9 percent.  Bigot pastor is Homosexual Himself.  People who are Anti or Pro are mostly Homosexual.  People who do not talk or mention about Homosexual are not Homosexual because it is not there interesting.  You simply cannot fool Human Psychology and Human eyes
@annafifield Hope he paves the way North Korea opening to the world.
@JChengWSJ All in the family blood line.
@willripleyCNN President Trump. LMAO.
@annafifield What Communist/ Socialist System means.
@chadocl Seriously getting down to earth.
@tokyoreporter Lame and Stupid.  Is it a Movie.
@NellyKorda Nelly, Congratulations.
@JChengWSJ If I were Kim Jung Un.  I would.  Let Samsung Company invest in North Korea big time.
@MissMiaKang All African American players are all good.
Here is another misinformed information on Wikipedia. Japan Hata Clan.  Hata clan came from Korean Peninsula two Korean Kingdom ( Baekje, Shilla, even Korguryo settlers). They are not Chinese or Jewish. If people really think the Hata clan is Chinese or Jewish. They are mind warp
@koryodynasty I remember the 1988 Seoul Olympic, 2002 World Cup Korea and Japan, 2018 Winter Olympic.  People who feel doubt toward success will always feel doubt.  It is part of there DNA.  Which you and I can do nothing about it.  So " Let It Be".
@tokyoreporter Just full of them walking around in Japan. All lined up to bloody wank.
@tokyoreporter He did not wash his hands.
Japan Key Tomb came from ( Korean Peninsula to Japan) not another way around. Not sure who Korean Historian Japan agreed to but " Wikipedia" information and facts are wrong.  Wikipedia: Topic: Japan Key Tomb during the Yayoi Period.
@chadocl @TheBlueHouseENG Honestly and truthfully. You have to be Korean to understand the North. Even that isn't easy.
@JChengWSJ Korea Starbucks no stop of ( Korea Market expansion). No stopping.
@therealautoblog Love to have it in SUV 4x4 wheel drive. Type of car needed in the Korean Market. The biggest downfall of this car is an open truck on the back. They should make it more rooms and baggage space.  Not open truck!!!!!!
@MaximMag The only thing it matters is not to be in conflict matter or avoiding conflict is what very smart people do.
@DrMarkPBarry Russia: For Russia, it is a better for the Korean Peninsula to be united under South Korea. Russia wants to do business with Koreans.  No War!!!!!!!!!!!! Plus do you know Putin second daughter is in South Korea married to Samsung man?  No Joke.
@pollsofpolitics @POTUS @realDonaldTrump People do not realize. Southern State like Texas, California, All-South States. The border is seriously needed. They lobbied President Trump very strongly. President Trump is there voice and opinion.
@lisastark351 Awkward and funny picture. LMAO.  Cap color.  Red and Blue.
@ColinCrooks1 Does North Korea need the ship???? Giving back to the U.S. will only help North Korea in along run with a relationship with the United States of America.  I think it is about time for North Korea to give back.
@Mattel Cool. Awesome and Cool thing about BTS.  All members are a unique personality. Reminds me of " Beatles".
@MarvelStudios Korean Movie Market: Super Hot demand.
@GordonGChang South Korea: Hyundai and KIA cars company, Shipbuilding, all labor-intensive jobs going all Robot. South Korea will go AI, 5G, IT research and Technology, all Service industry fast pace.
@lisastark351 lisa, I really like your twit.  Every time makes me drink coffee.
@GordonGChang Communist State, Fascist State, Mafia State.  South Korea is surrounded by them all.  South Korea is only Democratic/ Capitalist State Americans can trust. Out of China, Russia, Japan, and North.
@BroderickGreer Spirit can be reached so many different ways.  Much better than Kamikaze " Coccain" addict Pilot during WW.II.
@PageSix Two daughters leave for college, Kate wants to date.  Kate, if you're trying to make Jon jealous. Not going to work. Kate, Jon new girlfriend she is really down to earth person.  I really wish and hope Kate. You can be down to earth person too. Money makes people crazy. Sex also.
@qz Not copied. North Korea probably made and provided those shoe company using third party names.
@CNN @wcapsnet The state of Hawaii is getting more snow than the Korean Peninsula.  That is just crazy.
@josungkim Honestly and truthfully does South Korea/ Korean woman, in general, know what " Me too" actually means??? If Korean Woman really knows what it means. I honestly consider Korean woman are not innocent people.  Stalking, Hitting Men, Shouting toward Men, Not respecting equal gender
@JChengWSJ Keeping the Vietnamese aware.
@KBSnews 그 "거미" 잠바 가 " 마약 중독 잠바"  Meaning.

@MissMiaKang Hope you're doing well.  Not falling into the " Pimp Daddy" trap.
@MarvelStudios The reason why I like her.  She does not BS.
@MissMiaKang You cannot eat pork.  I wish and hope you do well.
@ccbasher She will just do fine. She knows how to balance.
@tokyoreporter Says DNA.
@tokyoreporter Body fluid??? Just say his " Sperm".
@annafifield All lined up.
@MintaroOba Fascist Abe does not make any much better.  All in History Hideyoshi Korea invasion to WW.II 36 years Japan Military Fascist occupation of the Korean Peninsula.
@josungkim I guess Capitalism ( South Korea) takes much more responsibility, rather than Socialist Communist ( North Korea).  Take a look at economy size. Who works more South or North.  All in the system.
@tokyoreporter Are there many dead corpses in Kumamoto city????
@sarahjeong I will take the side of vaccine instead.
@josungkim Pimp caught in the act.
@annafifield Shows the U.S. intermingle with everything. But I do not blame them. Always in the middle of things.

@hankookilbo Clearly shows " Byuntei" comes all shapes and sizes.
@tictoc He looks like a fish.
@debreese @MultiPATRIOT Hawaii University Mascot and North Dakota University Mascot are classic ones.
@BryanDruzin Clearly shows Australia has more Dessert than Human population. Whereas the Korean Peninsula smaller than Australia land mass but Human population wise another way around.
@BryanDruzin Isn't the map another way around.  South Korea is cybersecurity whereas  Japan is China growing threat.  The map is wrong in many ways.  Not accurate.
@josungkim South Korea 80's is North Korea in 2019 fashion.  Yes. North Korea is way back.
@LynnKawano His cool about it. Likes he knows to get out of it.

@willripleyCNN The real threat is the United States breaking off Russia Nuclear Weapon treaty.  Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, Arab Nations are all in ( U.S. Nuclear Bomb) lists.  If North Korea ( Kim Jung Un) smart just keep the missile National defense.  Not shoot like before.

@BruceKlingner @josungkim How about Japan.  Japan should pay more.  Not Korea.  $ Trillion dollar is enough for Korea.
@josungkim 70 years making wrong friends ( China and Russia).  North Korea should drink Americano Coffee and wake up.

Korea is looking forward to Captain Marvel Movie.  New Avengers End Game, Spiderman,  New Black Panther 2
@BryanDruzin ROK.
@josungkim Dangerous.
@tokyoreporter He had to do it.  Just had to.  A demon like addiction took over his soul.
@BBCLBicker North Korea always have known for Wheat for bread and noodles.  Not for rice..  all rice farmers were from the South.
@lisastark351 He looks stoned.
@tokyoreporter Kyoto/ Kansai woman look like Korean.
@TheJihyeLee I remember it Seoul 1988,  Korea 2002 World CUP,  2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympic.  The reaction was the same as below. Bias people will always remain bias. Nothing New.  Nothing logical about it. They were born to have a bias in human DNA.
Walking Dead.  Bring back Glenn, Abe, Beth as a Ghost. Save the show falling apart.  Connecting Glenn with Maggie, Abe with ( Sexy Nurse Warrior), Beth with Daryle.  It is time Walking Dead bring back the connection.  The current storyline is Dead End.
@freekorea_us When you think of Korea. Do you think of the North or South????
@Robert_E_Kelly Not laughing. But North Korea has very big potential. If the leader " Kim Jung Un" think straight.  People in North Korea are defecting in big numbers especially the elites.

@BryanDruzin The reason why the South Korea flag has ( Red and Blue) circle. The world is actually divided between " Red and Blue". It is no coincidence.
@yonhaptweet Eating own feces.  Woman Chowder.
@RecordingAcad @BTS_twt BTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Respect.
@tokyoreporter Respect for a woman.
@realDonaldTrump @JChengWSJ Power of respect.
@MarvelStudios Power and Discipline.
@josungkim You cannot Gamble to get rich.  You make money. It takes personal sacrifice and discipline.  The reason why making and saving money is hard.  If you discipline and sacrifice. You can save and make money.  Easy money, Easy spend.
@koryodynasty @JChengWSJ Great show.
@JChengWSJ @hj257 $1 Trillion Dollars ( South Korea are paying for Tax money)  Pyeongtaek U.S. Military base ( World largest) outside U.S. Territory.
@DrMarkPBarry President Trump ( Maybe) has said.  Keep current Nuclear Missiles for your National Defence.  But if you make new Nuclear Missiles or threat the United States. The United States will Nuke you.  Current state ( Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, all Arab Nations) on the lists.

@HTC_MalloryM Please send me more of your picture. My kindness will show.
@Robert_E_Kelly Fundamental differences between the two leaders.  Not right to compare.
@A_TakemotoKyodo @opendprk You can really tell it was tough.  Korean food to relieve his stress.
@GordonGChang The fundamental difference between the Communist World and the Capitalist World.  Communist avoid competition because the government owns it.
@Evan_W_Davis They are worse than an animal.
@tokyoreporter Fundamentally:You call this kind of person " Psychopath" or "Psychopath Sex Addict Killer" ( enjoys blood and Horror Hitting Psychopath sex).  Thai people are the most "Open mind" woman you will meet.  If you cannot get along with them. You are Animal Lowlife Dog!!! and a Beast!!
@tokyoreporter Yakuza and Police ( work together, exchange information etc).  Fundamentally/ Common Sense.  Can you believe and trust yakuza????
@i_ilyo The first time I would like to see both of them in Vietnam. Has much deeper meaning.
@WSJ Typo Be.
@SBS8news As long Japan is Fascist.  Common sense for Koreans loose interest toward Japan fast.  The reason why Koreans do not travel or spend money on Tokyo Disneyland or Osaka Universal Studio.  Koreans do not have interest spending on Japan!!!! Japan SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!

@HuffPostUK California Job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@tictoc Reality H-Pop has been along dead.

@JChengWSJ Viet Fucking Nam is coming from your angle or seriously from Young Pioneer Tour?????
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS President Trump.  The smarter and Straighter path for North Korea that needed for the past 70 years.
@willripleyCNN North Korea right and smarter path.
@UNrightsSeoul @UNHumanRights Past 70 years. North Korea Kim Jung Un family had wrong friends. China and Russia. It is easy to blame North Korea Human rights but honestly and truthfully what did North Korea really learn about Human Rights if they had China and Russia two nations that have terrible Human Right
@dprkwatch Kim Jung Un pushing flag at the center of new loyalty campaign means all high Government elites are defecting and leaving North Korea.  ( Canada, USA, South Korea, U.K.).
@BryanDruzin 1) Melting of Ice Berg ( North Pole).  2) Nuclear War/ Killing Human man Kind. 3) Destroying Wilderness/ Natural Resource/ Human Waste water pollution.

@MintaroOba @JChengWSJ Keep the second summit as simple as possible.  Maybe the third or fourth meeting can include other leaders. But Time is not now.  President Trump and Kim try to make long and winding road straight as possible.
@BryanDruzin Cool.
@BBCLBicker @OliviaEnos North Korea ( Human Rights Issue) is a very tricky issues.  Whereas Nuclear Issues and North Korea Economic Issues should be one category with North Korea.
@koreatimescokr 99.9 percent what The Korea Times to report always doomed to fail.  From Economic forecast, Business, Politics, Sports, Tourism, etc.  Always wrong about Korea. Known to give false reporting to Non-Koreans.
@JChengWSJ The open date means this......................
@BryanDruzin Hahahaha Flash.
@GordonGChang China Missile plus Russian Technology.  Fatty the third using them for his own needs.  So technically what comes around, what it goes around.  All in the same league.  President Trump getting to know China, Russia, and North Korea well. All in the same basketcase!!!!!!!
@chadocl North Korea Human Right Role model has been ( Russia and China) for the past 70 years. Take a good common sense look at those nations first before any western journalist take a stab at North Korea Human Right Record. Just Common sense.
@JChengWSJ @38NorthNK Using Vietnam as a role model. But using South Korea ( Park Chung Hee Economic Policy) work ethic is a way to go and future for North Korea Economic development.
@RobatoMaholo Prostate removal surgery is the best solution.  Cancer spreads.  All other surgeries, Chinese herbs, other pills do not work.
@willripleyCNN Will, 1) the United States banned the Nuclear Treaty with Russia a couple weeks ago. So President Trump puts U.S. target list( Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, all Arab Nations). 2) North Korea is smart, not stupid. North keep current nukes, whereas not make new one's threat U.S
@GordonGChang Do not forget South Korea/Korea should be ranking in the top 20.
@ashpawlakk Korean BBQ looks good.

@tokyoreporter Stabbing her in the mouth????? Very bad.
@willripleyCNN Not sure about Major War. But I would say. He is the first American President trying very hard to solve this mess. Which President Clinton signed the bill. It would not evolve around like this. Ex-President Bush( Axis of Evil) line did not really help North and U.S. relationship.
@News_Y Not true.  Dark Metallic or Marroon Red, Dark Green.  White is weak.

@motokorich Simply saying " Admit your guilt".  If you admit it.  You will have deeper trouble.  Not sure what is Human common sense logic to it.
@JChengWSJ Logical.  Nobody in the World uses it.
@GordonGChang Hell Chosun ( Expression) derived from 화교 ( Overseas Chinese community in South Korea).  I have never heard Koreans ( Young or old) say Hell Chosun.
@GordonGChang China is " Communist Vassal State".  China thinking to treat South Korea like vassal state because Koreans treat China like Korea vassal state.  The world works both ways, never one way.

@lisastark351 Shouting match. It is good. This is exactly what they need.
@KasulisK No more Puns.
@StormyDaniels lmao.
@GordonGChang Gordon, do not feel surprised. If China attacks Taiwan.
@lisastark351 So direct and funny.  Love it.
@MetroUK A black man at work.
@josungkim @JChengWSJ Korea adoption agency is business and fundamentally corrupt.
@JChengWSJ Jim Rogers know the potential. Only if Kim Jung Un and 30 Million North Koreans wake up. If all of them walk in straight mind path.  Unified Korea can become a major power.
@RCamposDuffy @AOC @SenSanders All lined up.
@annafifield Animals
@NYDailyNews Making a movie.  " Wolfman in NYC".
@EdwardHBOh Not Han.  Just self-stupidity.
@lisastark351 lmao.  I agree.
@annafifield He would be happy for what reason????
@YonhapNews Wrong place to be.
@GordonGChang About time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NO MORE CHINA COMMUNIST PARTY MONEY AND INFLUENCE ON SILICON VALLEY!!!!!!! ABOUT TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@ktlynnjoy About time.  I always have known.  Korea Korean adoption agency always has been a corrupt business.
@Robert_E_Kelly Clown Show Mess is South Korea Defence Bill that the U.S. wants South Koreans to pay.  The U.S. ambassador not making it better.  That is a fundamentally a big mess.
@tokyoreporter We will see her in Japan Porno soon.
@ABC Not trying to stir any problems. But the kid had it coming.
@JChengWSJ Walking is no problem.  Come on.  China far worse than the Korean Peninsula.
@annafifield When will Canada wake up????
@annafifield Cold Weather.  Riding a bike.  When will " Seoul Mayor" wake up to the reality.  He's wasting money, time and resources on Shared Bike.  Not only Beijing.  Seoul too has the same problem.
@KasulisK When Professor immune system goes down and gets terrible flue.  Do not blame himself he hasn't eaten Kimchi.  If you look down on Kimchi.  The natural cause will get you back a very big time!!!! No Joke.
@tokyoreporter Smart idea.  Nobody can read it.  Plastic cover.  Waste of money and paper.
@LynnKawano The guy looks bald and dangerous.
@GordonGChang Come on.  Like China Communist Party is innocent.  You need to open your eyes.
@StormyDaniels Sex-based " Supply and Demand" as long men get a hard erection.  You will earn money.  ^^
@MSNBC Catholic School Principle should have written an apology letter.  It would have been a much smarter idea. Group of Kids mockery.
@BrewMaster_T @annafifield @nvanderklippe The death sentence is not the way. If you think China Communist Party handling things is good.  Then you are not different from North Korea handling Otto Warmbier.
@GordonGChang China Communist Party trying to rewrite the History book. It will never happen.
@tokyoreporter Reality Korea is.  Not Japan.  Japan is very conservative compared to Korea.
@DavidMaxwell161 First Round. Not the main discussion.
@BBCLBicker I can only guess. It is like the South Korea military system. Having discipline and maintaining a certain weight.  So on...............
@GordonGChang Like China Communist Party.
@BleacherReport Drake is fake.
@gailkimITSME Send us your pic.  It has been awhile.
@StormyDaniels @mikequasar Hope the snack includes your " Love Box". ^^
@JChengWSJ @38NorthNK Stairway to Heaven.
@willripleyCNN While " Sun is coming down".
@tokyoreporter We call the Tokyo Pimp City.  Black Cat.
@oinkorea Do the right thing. She is my Hero.  Corruption runs deep in South Korea sports.
@GordonGChang President Trump and Kim Jung Un must realize.  Pull out U.S. troops from South Korea.  Department of Defence (DOD) to Supreme Court.  Many hurdles and obstacles. It will be like John F Kennedy Cuba crises within the United States.  My careful analysis would be No and Never.
@wikitree They use and express " Negative/ Low Self-esteem" words and expressions.  All " Mental and Personality" related disease.
@allyjung BTS doing more than Military service.  Helping South Korea economy.
@tokyoreporter Just like Horror Movie. CNN reports Japan Suicide rate has fallen for 18 years.  I Always knew CNN is full of BS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@AlekSigley @TongilTours @nknewsorg Conservative. Compared to average Korean beauty.
@BostonDotCom Hockey players should know.  Zdeno Chara has height and long arm advantage. He should be a boxer.
@tokyoreporter Rat. She fits perfect.
@Breaking911 We need a full story on this.  Why were the girls shouting at him??? surrounded him and yelling.
@nydia_han @philamuseum Great Picture.
@tokyoreporter Hard to believe. As long Mt Fuji Park is still open. Many Japanese will die.
@oinkorea Jobs and Security.  Plus he wasn't elected as president.  Just time and opportunity of right for him to be President of South Korea.  Ex-President park did a terrible job and she hurt many South Koreans fundamentally.
@StormyDaniels A woman likes and enjoys licking too.  World and Woman work both ways.  Think beyond your mental framework box.  Helps a lot knowing Sexual World of Humans.
@BryanDruzin Amazing.
@willripleyCNN Vietnam. ASAP.  Love and Peace.
@GordonGChang China Communist Party:  Cultural Revolution. Basic Fundamental Gap started from here. Degrading Human and Justifying Human Degrading: Chinese Confucianism. Nothing New!!!!!!!!!!!!! The reason why China failed.
@RachelMinhee Half Korean website paid tribute to her along time ago. Plus Korean Americans themselves have no idea about there own history.  Plus no idea to share correct history to American audiences. That is a very big shame.
@willripleyCNN Keeping the dialogue channel open. Very smart idea. In this regard, President Trump is doing the right thing.
@kimgamel Wasn't he blacklisted by U.S. Government?
South Korea beat China 2-0 in Asian Cup 2019
@FlyANA_official Sea Turtle????? No Thank U.
@oinkorea Blames on China. It is called " China Yellow Sand Dust"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please get your facts correct. Before you say or write " South Korea chokes on smog".
@MarvelStudios She kicks ass.  Love it.
@tokyoreporter Was he bald???????
@KasulisK Nice Picture.
@MissMiaKang Sexy Meow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@josungkim Please get your terminology correct.  IT IS CALLED " CHINA YELLOW SAND DUST" COMING OVER KOREAN PENINSULA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT IS NOT AIR POLLUTION OR HEAVY FINE DUST.  IT IS CALLED " CHINA YELLOW SAND DUST"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@annafifield @nvanderklippe China Communist Party at work. So typical.  One-day trial.  No big difference with North Korea.
@koreatimescokr Justice served by Korean Tree.
@nknewsorg @BBCLBicker Probably made in China.
@chadocl Probably came from China. North Korea no longer make it.

@TomLynch_ @nbcwashington I miss pouring snow.  Having none in Korea.  Just China Yellow Dust sand or Russian Siberia Snow.  I miss Snow or Pouring Rain.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I envy the Snow.
@GarethPorter Starting A Major War. So Dangerous!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@KasulisK Today is Sauna day for all Koreans.  Steam Sauna probably the best solution.  Helps clear your lungs, throat, nose.  Even weather gives Koreans to go to Sauna and relax.  Very uncommon in the U.S.
@osirimuramura Sweet.
@AnnieYuTV @wusa9 I call it Winter Snow.  Korea at the moment.  China Yellow Sand dust or Siberia Wind.  No Snow or Rain.  Not good.  I wish for pouring snow or rain.
@ABC This Mexican guy enjoys linking doorbells????? We all know what he's thinking but the difference here is orgasm toward electricity.
@oinkorea Whiskey, Lemon, Salt, with Diet Coke.  How Koreans drink it.  Also Korean side dish.
@KasulisK With coffee and Massage Chair.  Only 10,000 Won.
@AlastairGale @AlexktMartin Come to Korea.  Price wise cheaper.  Service and Food. Much Better and Much Quieter.  You can actually socialize and talk.  Instead, girls trying to give you BJ.
@BryanDruzin Recycle the clothes.  Send them to Africa or South America, North Korea.
@JChengWSJ @AlastairGale @dasl_yoon As long Japan Fascist Government deny Japan WW.II. It is a Korean job to remind them of the reality.  FINAL CONCLUSION:  PROBLEM IS NOT SOLVED. NEVER ONE WAY SOLUTION. IT TAKES TWO PEOPLE/ TWO NATION TO SOLVE IT. WHICH JAPAN ALWAYS DENY. BLAME ON KOREA!!!!! THAT IS FUCKING JAPAN!
@GordonGChang Samsung and LG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! USE IT. FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@Drumboy44DWS Ambush Warfare.
@GordonGChang Do you think Taiwan is part of China???
@GordonGChang Come to South Korea.  Starbucks Korea only American Business surpassing Pizza, Hamburger, Ice Cream, Soft Drink, Cars, Movies all combined together.  Koreans love Starbucks Coffee House.
@ABC WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Disgusting.
@DrMarkPBarry South Korea Government paying enough.  How much President Trump want South Korea to pay????
@BryanDruzin Germans has populated America.  German Invasion.

@Newsweek Disgusting.  Look like Alien.
@tokyoreporter looks like rolling whorehouse.
@annafifield Ice boy has become Police boy.
@oinkorea I never tried it ( shrimp burger) and Shanghai ( Chicken burger).  If names not right.  Do not try it.  Not worth it.
@LynnKawano MMA husband beating his MMA wife, Brother distributing drugs to his sister.  Just crazy.
@oinkorea I would not be surprised if South Korea reaches 70 Million honestly. If they only have a simpflied system. Such as South Korea provinces should not be divided into North and South.  If they have one single simple province.  Governing would be much easier.
@oinkorea Those are minority groups you will find everywhere in Asia not just Korea.  Have a balance report.
@BW I realize this in Taiwan and China.  Simply people just eat too much in everywhere they go. From Subway to Bathroom.  Disgusting.
New Twitter is nice.
Korea seriously needs Snow or Rain.  China Yellow Sand is just making the air terrible.
Let's all enjoy Year of Golden Pig.
@lisastark351 LMAO.  So true. LMAO.
@KasulisK @consnow Korean Woman has to choose.   Work or Marriage/ Raising family.  The reason why the gender gap exists.  You cannot do both or have both.
@KasulisK One of those type of guys.  Crazy........................
@oinkorea You call it Thor wrong enemy.
@KasulisK Pretty Soon.  New Years Day.   Year of Golden Pig.   Let's spread the love around the world.

@GordonGChang You need to choke the dragon.
@DrMarkPBarry Abe regrets????? What Korea been through for the last 170 years with Japan.  Regret????  Fascist Japan!!!!!!!!!!
@MissMiaKang Mia, I miss your sexy profile pic.
@ChloeKim How is your stomach flu??? How do you feel???
@GordonGChang Before China stolen Apple.  They stole Samsung, LG too.   China stealing has a history.
@GordonGChang So do you think China Communist Party is always right???? or Do you think you are always right????
@KasulisK Thank God Korea has a Sauna and Ondul system.
@NewsHour @DubstepInDPRK PBS and President Trump.  I wish you Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.  Thank You.  You were the first American President that took action on North Korea.  I seriously and honestly Thank You from bottom of my heart.
@GordonGChang China ambition is Taiwan, Singapore, Overseas Chinese,  South East Asia belongs to China. He does not know or acknowledge Manchuria/ North East China belongs to Koreans.  You cannot hide the truth in History.
@BryanDruzin Two hearts becomes one.
왕진진,  그 짱개 국내 화교 색이 좀 감옥애 50년 하라!!!!!!!! 그 중국집 씨발 개색이 언재까지 " 한국인 척" 하면서 대한민국 " 법 과 질서" 욕멱개 하냐.  중국개 놈은 처방하라!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 재주도, 서해, 호남,  짱개지할 한다!!!!!!!!
@MissMiaKang @HSBC Nice Job.  Mia.  ^^
@BryanDruzin Just shows World lives in the U.S.
@GlobalAsianista Red Bull????? not a good mixture.  You gonna burp or go to the bathroom often.
@realDonaldTrump I wish and hope.  Kim Jung Un think and act straight.  Pursue economic and trade.  They lost 70 years pursuing there self-isolated dream.  Like People, Family, Nation,  cannot live in self isolation.  North Korea is perfect example. Frog living alone in dry water pond.  Need Help
@ElizabethHurley NICE.
@AlastairGale Rule of thumb for North Korea is " They admire Boldness".
@oinkorea More like the United States rather then Korea.
@thehill God bless you.
@ChloeKim Drink ( Lemon/ salt/ honey warm water).   Do not drink milk or acid like drinks such as fruit drinks or soft drinks.  Take Antibiotic medicine.   Drink Gatorade,  Keep empty stomach and flush it out.   Stay home and rest.  Keep your stomach warm.
@JChengWSJ Yes, Soft and Gets hard.
@oinkorea Korea needs Drive Thru Taco Bell.
@samkimasia Power of Samsung!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@BleacherReport @aasdanny That was one close call................  Stay sharp people!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@Robert_E_Kelly Hahahahahaha,  Happy New Year.   One cool picture.  Wow, I thought it was Busan.  Anyway, nice picture of your family.  Best wishes.   Do not tell us you moved to Indiana coast of Lake Michigan.
@oinkorea Come on.   I lived in Korea for over 7 years.  I have never seen it.
@wikitree 홍대 문재점 " 대만 국적 국내 화교" 들이 많다.  그리고 한국인 척한다.   일본 가면 중국인 척.  대만가면 한국인 척.   미국가면 대만중국인 척.   " 척 하는 놈들 색이들" 너머 많다.  이것이 기분 족으로 문재점 이다.  " 척 하는 놈들".
@BBCLBicker Please do not catch a cold.  It can get really cold in the Mountain. As a Korean National.  The year 2019.  Year of Golden Pig.   I wish Koreans can travel North and South freely like Ireland.  Hope for Business and Trade can take off between North and South.
@thehill This is a thing.  Can U.S. Gun crime/ shooting go down if they stopped or blocked illegal immigrants coming to the U.S.???? What is wrong with the U.S. is American Gun policy.  Gun ownership!!!! Let's make Gun Ownership much stronger!!!!!!
@JChengWSJ Japan is still clouded with WW.II past mistakes. The Japanese politicians especially cannot man up with responsibility.
@KasulisK Not Democracy or Freedom of Speech is crumbling.  It is President leadership is tumbling down.
@JChengWSJ The actual name is " Chosun Sea"  not East Sea or the even Sea of Japan.
@oinkorea No missile launch.  That's good.
@Robert_E_Kelly Again who is bias here?   Because you do not care it does not mean other people care. I'll bet you 100 percent.  BTS worldwide fans care.
@GordonGChang Past 70 years China Communist Party always has been itching to kill there own Chinese national and Americans.  Foundation China Communist Party always has been " Itching" to Kill for past Thousand Years.
@JChengWSJ End of the year.  Many crazy bitches get arrested or murdered in Korea.  Stay smart, go home early.  Winter time in Korea.
@Breaking911 He should just call the cops.
@JChengWSJ South Korea ( Military) should change the system.  Fight the enemy, not Killing the rich ( upper class).   South Korea enemy is within instead of figuring out the actual enemy.  The reason why South Korean youth do not want to serve South Korea military.
@JChengWSJ Light up " Tall Tree Tower".  That would make tallest Christmas tree in the World.
@GordonGChang Too Bad China had to take the wrong side of Force.  Dark side.
@LynnKawano Crazy.  Wish you patience.
@MissMiaKang Lick you instead.
@MayorHarryKim Merry Christmas. Mayor Harry Kim.  God Bless You.
@illwill131 @MissMiaKang Sexy picture of her.  Very nice.
@MailOnline Stalking Penis.
@ElizabethHurley Nice.
@JChengWSJ Square one.  Americans should be happy South Korea government paying more than half of U.S. American Military stationed in South Korea.  Unlike not funding buy U.S. Tax money like some other nation around the world.
@willripleyCNN Japan addiction to " Whale Meat Sushi".   Like eating Dog Meat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@LynnKawano Christmas Rain.  Great day to drink Coke and Rum.
@GordonGChang Itching to start War.  How stupid.
@ElizabethHurley Happy Christmas. You look nice.
@SouthernKeeks For the past 7 years except for North Korea.  South Korea did not receive any snow during Christmas.  Weather is very strange.  Even British Isle getting more snow than Korean Peninsula.  What happened to White Christmas???!!!!!!  Love Snow!!!!!
@invisibleman_17 Happy Christmas.  Tears.
@ColinCrooks1 Happy Christmas Sir.  You going to have one busy year.
@willripleyCNN Merry Christmas.
@TODAYshow When it whips around a person's face.  It can hurt the eyes.  I can truly understand it.
@MissMiaKang Mia, you make my cock jealous.
@AdamParkhomenko LMAO.  Hahahahahaha.  You have to admit.   Only U.S. President that has been very outspoken right or wrong!!!!!!!! President Trump would have been great NYC Mayor.
@GordonGChang Communist China at work.  So typical.
@nydia_han @6abc @GrayHall6abc @chris_sowers Happy Christmas.
@nydia_han @KimmelCenter Happy Christmas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Look great.
@OhMyGOFF @Robert_Ellis3 @nbcwashington She is so cute.  Merry Christmas.
@LynnKawano Nice.
@oinkorea Is Christmas Date or Christmas Eve Sex a Sin??????????? Do not tell me.  You are Old Virgin.  That is very naughty indeed.
@ElizabethHurley Nice.
@Levitt_Matt Good chance Turkey will become " Middle East Policeman".
@DrMarkPBarry His family is a Root founder to ( Yonsei Medical Hosptial).  The first doctor to introduce American Ambulance to Korea.
@JChengWSJ All lined up.
@BryanDruzin South Korea ( 5G).   Samsung, LG, SK, Hynix.
@NarangVipin Not in Coma.  Soon or later North Korea express their demand.  I think President Trump already knows the demand.
@ColinCrooks1 Pyongyang means flat land in Korean.  The only city in the Korean Peninsula that does not have Mountain.  City size actually bigger than Tokyo.  I wish and hope it will modernize and become Mega City.  Again if they pursue Modernization Policy.
@davidlipson Fans probably thought it was part of the show.
@breaking9111 Fans probably thought it was part of the show.
@OhMyGOFF Wow, gasoline line???? Happy Christmas.
@allyjung Sisters are tough.
@KoreaExpose Like I said for a thousand times.  Do not be surprised if the Japanese planted them like Cherry Blossom Trees in Korea.
@MissMiaKang Nice picture.
@agathe_lhomme All Middle East and Asia specialist are leaving President Trump.  Fundamentally worrisome.  Dealing with China, Russia, Iran, Israel, and North Korea.
@MailOnline Sick minded fuck.
@elisewho Just read CNN and Yahoo.  Mattis quiet the job.  Fundamentally not good.  He was an expert in the Middle East and Asia.
@willripleyCNN This is my personal intake.  President Trump and Kim Jung Un agreed.  North Korea can keep previous Nuclear Weapon.  But North Korea will not build " New" Nuclear Missiles and threat them against the United States.  President Trump knows it. He did not get played.  Current news!!
@JChengWSJ What it means.  North Korea is going to keep 20 or so Previous built Nuclear Arms.  President Tump and KIM Jung Un agreed North Korea will not make new Nuclear Weapons Missiles and threat the United States.
@allyjung @AFP Stupidity at best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@freekorea_us Kim Jung Un Three cards to play.	1) Let North Korea massive refugee to South.	2) Send all North Korea elite to Russia.	3) Unify/South Korea. ( This will massively change North East Asia Military, Politically, Economically, Geographically, Culturally, Socially) change: landscape
@StormyDaniels 😎✌️
@GordonGChang It is time North America truly understand what China Communist Party means..........
@StormyDaniels Nice.  Getting a copy.!!!!!!
@GordonGChang Directly or Indirectly that is what " Communist" Party means.............
@inbarspace The name😏😏😏😏😏 is called ( 9K 11 Fagot)????
@koreatimescokr Korean Air can reimburse Ticket money ( after the fine is deducted).  Airline company cannot call Police for arrest.  Passengers were stupid/late.  They did not harm anyone.  Being KPOP fans are not stupid or Idiot.  Do not generalize all KPOP for a few rotten apples.
@samkimasia Called Made in Taiwan.
@hankookilbo Psycho 101.
@Robert_E_Kelly @freekorea_us President Trump realizes on the thing.  The U.S. is at Economic/ Trade War with China.  The U.S. is at Political/ Military War with Russia in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.  A situation like this I think President Trump is correct to give patience and unhurried time with NK.
@BryanDruzin The swimmer is having fun.  Lucky it wasn't a Shark.
@MissMiaKang Sexy Mia showing it all.
@GordonGChang Remember MoonJaein was elected in South Korea because Ex President Park did terrible Job as President.  Does not mean South Koreans wanted Moon to be President.  Just Time and Consequence made it happen.  Regarding North Korea issues ( never trusted Yellow Party)
@chadocl Very few people.  It cost money and time to demonstrate.  New Korean reality.
@skcataldo Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@MissMiaKang Was it Snowing???
@CBSNews You forgot Nancy.  Female dog.
@SungYoonLee1 Not having Dokdo Island Military exercise will seriously sting South Korea creditability on South Korea Territory sovereignty.  Like always South Korea says Dokdo Island belongs to South Korea then suddenly they cancel.  South Korea 눈치 always killed Korea Territory Sovereignty.
@tokyoreporter All comes from influence Japanese Porno.
@koryodynasty How about China????,  Hong Kong?????, Taiwan??????, and Thailand??????

@YonhapNews Samsung and LG.
@annafifield @lindseywford @wendyscutler President Trump game plane is 1) Protect National/ Personal Security,  2) No stolen Technology able to be used as a finished product/ sell it abroad.  3)  No spying on Military Domestic/ International Sovereignty.
@theKFA World Cup 아니면 큰 경기애서 이겻으면.  쭐지 말고.
@tokyoreporter South Korean students work in Japan???? are they happy????????????????
@GordonGChang Good for you.  All Americans should leave China.  About time.  Soon or later it was about to happen. China tipping toe policy.  All of the fraud.
@AdamParkhomenko When " Middle Finger" never stops.    Body language showing at best.
@tokyoreporter 41-year old man.  Holding V sign.  Enough said.......................
@tokyoreporter I have never heard of this guy.  I saw the pictures.  This Chinese actor has one serious mental problem.
@GordonGChang I agree.  1.2 Billion Chinese living under " China Communist Party" umbrella.  For the past 70 years.
@motokorich That trend is dead for Japan.

@koreatimescokr Songpa.  Has crazy ass people in Seoul.  What a coincidence.
@MissMiaKang Mia, when you punch.  Turn your hip.  Punching power comes from your stomach, hip, and thigh muscle.  Hit hard with confidence.  Good job.
@dwnews I guess not enough woman back then.  Anal sex was widely spread.  Some German troopers walked funny.
@koreatimescokr Corrupt Communist China Woman.

@MissMiaKang Nice work out.  Just do not hurt yourself.
@themichellewie @KiraKazantsev Meat UP.  Nice.
@ftasia When will you learn?  Use Samsung Note!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Enough said..................
@TIME Not sure " the Choking up" is the right word.   Father and Son relationship.  They were both President of United States of America.  Both leaders.
@MissMiaKang Not sure why. You keep getting mixed up with Uber drivers.  You had a bad history at nightclub incident.  Is it your boyfriend or seriously Uber driver.  Let us know sweetie.
@yoonjung_seo If you seriously think his coming to Seoul.  Which I have serious doubt.
@tokyoreporter Toy Trucks.
@GordonGChang Patience and Persistence is Key factor to North Korea.   If you want back ward thinking North Korea Kim Jung Un regime to fall.  President Trump is doing right path.  To make vase break it is from outside not inside.
@sarahjeong Yup, China woman got arrested.
@EdKrassen I agree.  It is turbulent time.
CNN reports Hong Kong ranks #1 world travel city????? total bullshit.
@stonecold2050 Hey, come back here.
@samkimasia My God!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ABOUT TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@BryanDruzin Not really sure the chart is accurate or just overgeneralization based on geography.  But in reality couple of years back they did very similiar survey. It went to South Korea, Ireland, Italy, Isreal.  Not China!!!!!
@chosonexchange Why Vietnam???? Vietnam might be doing better than North Korea but Vietnam as a nation are far poorer than South Korea.  Plus Vietnam is a communist state, unlike the Korean Peninsula.  Wrong role model nation for Korea.
@chosonexchange Very nice picture.
@jwheels74 Be careful.  End of the Year.  Everybody is losing patience.  Including the cops.

@TheJihyeLee Try flying Air Lingus.  You do not know what depressing means.
@tokyoreporter What a scum bag.
@samkimasia Just a flier.  Nothing much.
@allyjung @Reuters The reason why China is called " Communist" state.
@samkimasia You simply forgot the very big picture.  China steals technology from Samsung.  Plus what do Samsung and LG stand for in the western world?   Democracy and Capitalism.  Like China phone not popular in the western world because of quality and security.
@GordonGChang What did North Korea Kim Jung Un learn from ( China and Russia two worse human rights nations on earth)?
@NellyKorda I feel the same.  Chilly cold weather makes me more tired.

@tokyoreporter Watching way too much Samurai Shows on TV.
@JChengWSJ The rise of interracial couples among Overseas Koreans.
@samkimasia @JChengWSJ President Moon is rushing without strong firm trust foundation between North and South.  Good chance.  Kim Jung Un will reject the request with an unlogical answer.

@JChengWSJ @38NorthNK Jonathan, you are reading into North Korea media.  South Koreans are fine with U.S. Americans.  I think you and I know the truth.  Chinese CCP media, Putin Media, North Korea media all Bull Shit.

@breaking9111 How can a qualified lawyer be arrested??? Angle isn't right.
@MissMiaKang You look so gorgeous.
@itsrightchoice @AlastairGale 1) Rewriting history book means rewriting history.  Do not try to fool yourself.  2) 20 Million Koreans during 1910-1945? You completely forgot Koreans living in Manchuria. 3) Your lack of acknowledging pretty astonishing. Like your perfect person deny Holocaust genocide existed!
@breaking9111 Going to happen soon or later.  His eyes clearly were showing it.
@tokyoreporter Tokyo is a city of Pimps and Prostitutes.
@tokyoreporter He looks like the Beatles.
@JChengWSJ I see Tourist wondering off to North Korea side and never coming back.
@agathe_lhomme Korean managers or Korean company directors.   What can I say??????????
@YonhapNews Violated or not.  Without Samsung.  South Korea has no economy.
@VictorDCha The problem here is President Moon knows the truth.  Just his not saying or accepting it. This is a major problem.  Not U.S.- South Korea Alliance.
@UmaroDjauCNN @Acosta Truth is on that day.  He did push the limit.  Pushing limit isn't Journalism.  Reporting the truth is.
@stonecold2050 Powerful and Emotional Picture.   Histoical.  No Words.
@MetroUK Arab Gang with knives.  What was the reason for behind the attack???
@koreatimescokr No, I like Korean Cass Beer.
@itsrightchoice @AlastairGale First) You cannot rewrite History.  Truth comes out.  Second) It was Japan Military Fascist Government that occupied the Korean Peninsula for 36 years. I will stress " Fascist Military Government". Third) There were more than 12 Million Koreans in Japan 1910-1945. Yes, 3 Mil died
@annafifield Common Sense tells me U.S. Satellite is pretty much seeing inside and out North Korea.  Smart for Kim Jung Un not to hide because common sense tells me he cannot longer hide.  Science and Technology have improved tremendously for the past 70 years.
@DailyMail Cat really does have 9 lives.
@kwilli1046 @AndrewSErickson Once Japanese Professor at Harvard University told me.  The reason why Japanese dislike Koreans because Koreans are persistent and determine to win in any cost.  I guess Japanese do have Korean DNA 02b!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@tokyoreporter What a PUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@oinkorea I really miss that dude on Walking Dead.  TV drama not the same.
@JChengWSJ @CSISKoreaChair Kim Jung Un told the USA North Korea has 20-50 Nuclear Missiles.  Nothing is hidden about it.  Those are the North Korea missiles USA trying to dismantle.
@willripleyCNN 50-50 Percent.  Not sure Kim Jung Un is stupid to fool the world.
@tokyoreporter Japanese " neck" stabber.  Call her " Tokyo Dracula".
@tokyoreporter All Korean woman should pay extra attention!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@TheJihyeLee I agree.
@BirdingBeijing @ThCl_China Korean Tiger, not Siberian Tiger.
@JChengWSJ @BeyondCSISKorea It is called " Media Deception".   Not sure Kim Jung Un is that stupid!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@Hesthea @allyjung You call it Men who have " Criminal Act".  That is beyond Pervert or Sexual Addict.  Let's learn to differentiate the difference. Instead of categorizing all men are such are such.  Woman are like Angels or God Chosen people??? Sick and Tired Woman playing God.  My point!!!!!!!!!
@berandini @allyjung My Point was a woman should learn to differentiate between Men who have a criminal act and Men who have sexual perverted fantasy!!!!!  Like a western woman has bias feeling toward Men even though 30 percent of Porno is from U.S. A, 40 percent from Japan, 30 percent of Europe!!!!!
@MissMiaKang Lady in Red.  Nice.
@Robert_E_Kelly I heard the size of Seoul.  Land are burning in California.
@rpcward89 @nknewsorg @OliverHotham @chadocl As long they are improving going forward.
@AlastairGale Jewish Committee completely forgot.   Japanese killed millions of Koreans in Japan and the Korean Peninsula.  It was Japanese Military Fascism that invaded Korea and China butchering Millions of Chinese including Babies.  Korean Comfort Woman Issues,  Kanto Japan Earthquakes, etc
@DrMarkPBarry The greatest fear for Kim Jung Un.   North miscalculates and invades South Korea.  Second time around ( China or Russia helping North Korea or not.)  USA military might just end North Korea for good.
@BuckTurgidson79 I wish and hope both sides.
@YonhapNews 100,000 Tickets ( 88 Seoul Olympic Stadium).  Only capacity.

@koreatimescokr Korea Times: you are very arrogant. The U.S. fought in the Korean War.  Many U.S. soldiers died in Korea fighting independence.  For the past 70 years. The U.S. servicemen with ROK soldiers help to protect South Korea.  The U.S. Government let S.Korea goods to be sold in the USA.

@hanitweet 원전 " 중국 유교 문화"  건달 색이!!!!!!!!!!!! 부인 는 빠순이.
@koreatimescokr The U.S. is giving up on South Korea.   It is the end game.   President Moon not thinking straight.  Do you seriously think in a time of War?  South Korea top generals can handle 60 Million South Korea population pressure.  Landing of Incheon during the Korean War was led by U.S.
@samkimasia The reason why I dislike Korean News media.  They always focus on the wrong things.
@tokyoreporter Her Personality, Her character,  Her eyes,  naturally reveal itself.  She is one crazy woman.  Yes, she is weird.  The only reason she joined Abe Political Party.
@DrMarkPBarry Have you ever imagine how many women get sexually raped and abuse in 1.2 Billion people living under China Communist Party??? How many women get raped and abused under Putin Russia leadership??? Now past 70 years, both were North Korea Allie.   What fundamentally expect from NK!!
@Playboy @taolasvegas @CocoDeMerUK Like the first two girls.
@vunamphuong Is it real?????? Great Pic.
@MailOnline WTF. Disgusting.
@Hesthea @allyjung Let's separate from Men, Pervert, Sexual Addict.  I personally do not understand taking pictures of underwears or public bathrooms.  Let's make it clear it can be Japanese like planted Cherry Blossom Tree in Korea or Sexual Addict.
@annafifield Most reliable and expensive Ginseng is Korean made.  Give you a hint.
@BBCLBicker Soon you will hear " Frank Sinatra Christmas Songs in all Coffee shops in Korea".

@insight_co_kr You cannot stop pervert.
@BBCLBicker Laura, a great day for hiking.  But do not taste them.  You need to ask the nature wilderness Korea expert.   Ask the hikers.
@DrMarkPBarry Warmbier stealing " North Korea Propaganda Poster"  in North Korea law stealing and stealing any kinds of Propaganda poster is illegal.  Warmbier got wrong end North Korea stick.  Please remember stealing is a serious crime.
@allyjung Korea " Me Too" movement has fundamental problems. The movement itself is very vague. Korean woman taking photo/video/ without consent is a serious fundamental crime. Plus Korean woman stalk men ( Ex-boyfriend / Husband) serious crime. Korean woman does not have a grasp of law!!!
@JChengWSJ More North Korea population should settle in USA and Canada. Like Hong Kong refugee settlement during the British occupation ended.
@annafifield 1.2 Billion Chinese population vs 36% of factory robots.  Where are the rest of Chinese going to do or go????? China is growing very unbalance ways.
@themichellewie Love to join you.
@allyjung Korean Law/ Korean Police/ Korean Judge/ Korean System/  ( No understanding stalking is International Crime.  Stalking, Rape, Taking photo or video without consent is serious international crime!!!!!) Koreans have no idea how serious it is.
@MetroUK Four black perverts.
@MailOnline Yup, Made in China.  ONLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@BryanDruzin I call that " Nuclear Bomb".
@MissMiaKang very sexy pic.
@AsCorrespondent like World cares..................................
@annafifield What did China Communist Party say????
@oinkorea First)  South Korea ( PC Room) is an time bomb.  Full of perverts, loners, psychopath, losers,  just playing PC games or doing stupid things.  Lunatic hangout in South Korea.
@EvangelineLilly @thegocampaign @TaikaWaititi @njarecki @Realeliroth His Vampire fangs are showing.
@KasulisK For the record:  Chinese eat everything 4 legs except for wooden tables,  anything that flies except for Airplane.
@ABC Turkey should attack Saudi.
@KasulisK Like no one knew..........................
@KasulisK Foot binding ( China),  Eats dogs ( China and Filipino),  WW2 ( Japan).   Now China and Japan hold the largest U.S. debt.  Filipino no U.S. Naval Base.   Korean Peninsula ( Forgotten War) but North Korea has more than 7 Nuclear Arsenals and South Korea has Samsung and G20!!!!!!!!
@ReutersWorld Freaks me out even in Korea.  Summer hot day.  U.N. Human Rights Committee should order all Islamic nation not to wear the veil.
@oinkorea 99.9 percent that naked delivery is Chinese.
@willripleyCNN @cnni Beginning of  Horror for Hong Kong and Macau Chinese.  That long bridge is for China Communist Party military.   Tourism going to destroy Hong Kong and Macau. Crime will shoot up.
@phnompenhpost @KasulisK South Korea/ Koreans cannot sit still.   Need to go forward.  Only survival.
@annafifield Why all South Korea News media channel report the same news ( SBS, KBS, and MBC)  all three news channels have the same or similar news.  I agree woman voice should be heard as long it is level headed not bias.
@nypost Called lack of Communication.   Hang and Bang relationship.  Never get close.
@washingtonpost A person needs to get arrested for  ( Customer Harassment).  No need for racial slurs.  How can International Airline Company stand that kind of foul mouth crap?

@nypost Not sure to laugh or cry.
@nypost What a crazy ass story.
@nypost Not Zombie.  More like Drugged Out Woman.
@allyjung @jessicasunlee I realized if people suffered terrible verbal, Physical, Sexual, Rape, the trauma they usually do not have children.  They raise cats or dogs as Children. Koreans must realize the reality, not all adopted family are equal with education and income.
@allyjung American English you call it " Family Gathering"  if you compare yourself, Italian family, it is far worse than you can imagine.  The Italian, Mexican, Portuguese, and Greek family you need 30-100 seats in average.
@sheLLbeLL_xo @TheWarMonitor I think the same way.  Good Point.
@Strategy_Bridge This is what I really and seriously worry about President Moon administration.  The honest answer is I do not think so.  I think 99.9 percent Koreans think the same way as I do.
@tictoc Clearly Idiot in act.
@koreatimescokr Moon advisor is an idiot. As long South Korea is in United Nation and US allies for past 70 years. South Korea cannot just go alone. The world as Law and Order in which for past 70 years North Korea has not followed they have become a shit mess.  This Moon advisor better wake up!
@tokyoreporter Many dead people rotting in Japan.
@MissMiaKang Love it.  Spread your cheek, please.
@oinkorea President Trump Administration keep asking South Korea President Moon administration to pay for Defence cost.  I think Koreans are getting sick and tired of this one-way policy demand.  Always Money over Military Alliance.
@GlobalAsianista I always wondered why Japan Embassy is in Seoul, Korea.  Is there fundamental communication between two Nations?????  South Korea has no reason to have Japan Embassy.  Waste of time and money.
@sarahjeong Porno Sites, Faces of Death sites, many sick minded sites are free.  Like San Frascisco Human street feces.  Need to look carefully and not step on it.
@themichellewie Wish you well sweetie.
@LynnKawano We can see from the side.  Yup.
@GordonGChang Not sure what is worse.  President Moon moving fast with Kim Jung Un vs President Trump administration keep forcing South Korea to cough up more money on defense.  Majority of Koreans are confused and angry.  No Joke!!!!!!
@GJDiebelius @MetroUK Not creepy.  Just disgusting.
@sarahjeong Sweet and Smart.  So many garbage people.  Reminds me, San Francisco.  Human Feces all over the street.
@LynnKawano Look you had fun.  Looks very nice.
@GIKorea I really do not see the comparison.  Beware of South Korea netizens. 99.9 percent they are always wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@adealornodeal Coffee over steakhouse.

@TheKoreaHerald Typo Snack
@TheKoreaHerald 5,000 won.  You can buy Coffee, Ice Cream, Snakes.  Plus it is clean.
@GIKorea President Moon sinks to the bottom.  We know why.  I just and hope and wish he does not take whole South Korea or all Koreans in rock bottom.  Many Koreans say it reminds them when North Vietnam attacked and brainwash South Vietnam.  Look Vietnam now.  While Vietnam is Communist!
@chadocl @nktpnd Last name Panda.  Really??????
@Robert_E_Kelly In Yahoo topic says.  ( Fastfood makes obesity number 1 failure recruit to Military and its hurting American National Security Pentagon is worried about it).
Is San Francisco " Homeless Shit Hole" city???? So many human feces in streets of San Francisco.   The world has given new nickname San Francisco = Shit Hole City.
@kylecferrier @Diplomat_APAC Corruption plays a bigger role rather than Brain Power and Political Science.  Korean education system focus on Business, Medical, Law.  Very weak in liberal science like Political Science and International Relations.
@sarahjeong If you're going to drink Cass beer I will join you.
@KHONnews They serve the best coffee.  Kona Coffee.
@DailyCaller Retired Drama Teacher????? He looks like " Igore".
@HuffPostKorea Fundamentally I never trusted innocent Koreans.  They are most corrupt people in Korean Peninsula.
@annafifield @oranckay Past 70 years life or death situation within North Korea has been part of there lifestyle. Fundamentally North Koreans are not scared of death. Big fundamental differences between North and South Koreans. Just imagine 25-30 Million Kamikaze North Koreans chasing your ass.  Scary!
@Brasilmagic Queen Canada.   This is what it all means.

@motokorich Japan makes them much more confused.
@Robert_E_Kelly Average Americans just care about jobs and money.  This is an area in which President Trump is doing well.  Plus President Trump not being scared toward China. A big plus in Military and Middle Lower Class Americans or Working Class Americans.

@tokyoreporter Who robs Korean Mafia establishment business.  170 meter tall or not.  A person must be really stupid.
@willripleyCNN President Trump putting on a framework on China.   What China can do and What China cannot do.   What USA open eyes too toward too and What the USA will not open eyes too toward China.   It is a smart thing.  China needs a big push to stay in the line with rest of the world.
@GeographyNow @fanmaps I see many lines like the Korean Alphabet Hangul.
@insight_co_kr How about Kanto Earthquake????? Taiwan (Chinese) telling Japanese it was Koreans polluting the water.  Killed many Koreans in Japan.
@willripleyCNN Communist Party means ( China and Russia).

@DrMarkPBarry Cost isn't the problem.  North Korea " Mind" set is a fundamental problem.
@isaacstonefish What appealed to those 6 percent of Americans can be same supporting Israel or Neo-Fascist groups in America.
@koryoinleiden This is the what happens if you get brainwashed.  After the Korean War North Korea ( surprisingly) richer than South Korea.  North was able to support Koreans living in Japan.  Now the situation has become far different.  It is time Koreans in Japan become South Korean citizens.
@MaxCRoser The year 2018 Korean Peninsula combined together population should be about 90 Million.
@ABCPolitics I really think his crazy.
@KasulisK Be aware.  Both sides going to be very busy.  There are many mines.
@koreatimescokr Who cares.  Koreans need to look at the bigger picture.
@TheKoreaHerald South Korea political mess is what holding Korean Unification.  Kim Jung Un backward regime is also no exception to this Korean mess.
@chadocl It is wise for North Korea regime change attitude or tones it down.  I realize many nations around the world are losing patience and understanding.  Korean Peninsula is no exception.
@allyjung @AFP Bless you.

@samkimasia South Korea should Thank ( Samsung).   Without Samsung.  South Korea economy is doomed.
@TheKoreaHerald Common Sense:  Inside subway:  Put in front of you.  ( backpack).  Common Curiosity.  Passengers:  Hold on or Do not complain.  Do not be like that Korean girl displaying lame ass stupidity.
@Robert_E_Kelly At least both are them ( Trump-Kim) not " sleeping with enemies" relationships like the USA and Japan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@JChengWSJ North Korea Mafia State.
@YonhapNews South Korea needs to make and build better cars.  Only Quality sells well.  Final Conclusion.
@annafifield We call it the Yellow Sea.
@willripleyCNN I'm just the lucky majority of Koreans live and work in South Korea.  North Korea is a minority state in Korean World.   I just wish and hop North Korea regime better and smarter choice for a future path for North Korea.
@adamcathcart Letter to North Korea ( Kim Jung Un regime).   Trust goes both ways, never one-way direction. SERIOUSLY KEEP THAT IN MIND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHEN YOU MENTION ABOUT WORD OF " TRUST"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@Robert_E_Kelly The world has changed.  One thing I will say about North Korea.   Trusting North Korea goes both ways meaning ( North Korea Kim Jung Un regime vs Rest of the World).  Past 70 years never has been one-way trust.
North Korea reminder.  Trust goes both ways.  Never one way.
@ProudResister He said.  I like Beer.
@LynnKawano Three crazy ass Samoan.
@nypost You need to pace yourself.
@MontyBoa99 Can he even remember???????????????????????
@annafifield Rice full of black worms.   Bad news.
@Breaking911 He was Ivy Raper.
@JChengWSJ Not sure what to think of it.   South Korea Government are paying for U.S. serviceman stationed in South Korea.  Unlike U.S. Tax money goes to Isreal defense. Americans should feel very lucky.  We are not using USA tax money!!!!!!!!!
@BBCLBicker BTS tall tower promo was cool.
@rpcward89 @nknewsorg @OliverHotham @chadocl North Korea join U.N.  just saying..................... if they seriously open up.
@Robert_E_Kelly You need bold move to fulfill the promise:  North Korea Proverb.
@BBCLBicker China threat to Pacific and Russia threat to Pacific.   Korean Peninsula and Japan interest to have U.S. base stationed in South Korea.
@annafifield 40,000 thousand is one town population.
@Robert_E_Kelly Have you ever imagine North Korea joining U.N.????
@BuzzFeedLGBT She loves a woman more than man.
@annafifield Not very big Panda fan.
@JChengWSJ Korean Map should be dark green, not light blue.  Blue color represents the wrong color for the Korean Unified Map.  Dark Green is much better color.
@DrJaySong US troops out of Peninsula.  Is very dangerous bargain.   That will never happen plus the U.S. stationed in South Korea block China expansion in North East Asia.
@jljzen @MintaroOba Give me money.
@_SJPeace_ I support No War!!!!!!!!!!! Remember History.  Even the Roman Empire had a very hard time in the War in the Middle East.   War with Iran would be a disaster in the Middle East including Israel.  You thought the Vietnam War was bad.  War with Iran would far worse
@themichellewie Nice.
@DrMarkPBarry Kim Jung Un ( Two Kim's) put his son in a really rough isolated situation for the past 70 years.  Now does Kim Jung Un want to put his daughter or son in the same situation to rule North Korea??? Only answer yes North leadership need rapid change forward.
@DrMarkPBarry Not a big fan ( Korea Times News) my honest truth.   I read the Korea Herald over Korea Times.  Reason Korea Times News article poorly written, has bias perspective on everything.  One-sided media.  I do not trust one sided news media.
@koreatimescokr Massive Economic and Infrastructure Help.
@psharrell3 @EAsiaStudies Two-Face Fascist Abe at work.
@Crimson_Rei China and Russia will make it hard for Kim Jung Un to take the right path to success.  Both Socialist Communist Party Nations want North Korea as buffer zone. But the times have changed.  Kim Jung Un is a family man dictator.  Does he want his own children to suffer the same fate
@GlobalAsianista Clearly shows Japan is the Fascist government. How does Baek Du Mountain engaging anti-Japanese?   It was Japan Fascist Military government occupied Korea for 36 years.  They are preaching that Baek Du Mountain interprets Anti-Japanese!!!! Abe got elected three times. Brainwashed
@foxandfriends What is so sexy about that????
@insight_co_kr 병신 색이!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@Crimson_Rei Not having a direct dialogue between North/ South ( made distrust) not saying North Korea ( Kim family) was innocent in this regard. The world is Changing fast, for example, President Trump losing patience toward China, Russia, NK. The only way for North is opening up the economy
@Robert_E_Kelly Yes, I get that.  North Korea ( Kim Jung Un regime) does not have direct diplomatic relations with the U.S. Government.
@Crimson_Rei BaekduSan belongs to all Koreans.  President Moon and the majority 70 Million South Koreans do not believe or think in Juche.  Just do not get too carried away.  Past 70 years North and South had no War.  Let's keep it that way.
@BBCLBicker Blond Hair has to go.  I just cannot stand Koreans with blond hair.
@AlastairGale Elected Three times????? How about in U.S. or Britain.  Is it possible??? be elected three times!!!!!!!
@AlastairGale I call it Fascist Dictatorship.  One person elected three times.??? WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!
President Moon made a big announcement at North Korea May Day Stadium but why does North Korean clapping look dazed, confused, even laughing.  Is it because all those clappers are hand picked by Kim Jung Un like Pyongyang is Kim Jung Un hand-picked city!!!!!
@rpcward89 @nknewsorg Do not read into Kim Jung Un or North Korea News media.  Past 70 years it always has been the same crap.  But Kim Jung Un to survive.  North Korea needs to change.  Soon or later  People will die for trying to assinate the Kim Jung Un leadership regime.
@GGGBoxing @tecate You need to KO Canelo that is the only solution to win.  You missed it twice.  As your fan.  I always ask why ????
@JChengWSJ You need patience and gradual change. We all want rapid change.  You have two Communist Party ( China and Russia).Directly or Indirectly supporting Kim Jung Un.  Like it or not.  You need to have the patience to win. Rapid or impatience approach will get you killed in Mafia world
@KialoHQ Not all drugs.
@BuckTurgidson79 100,000 handpicked Pyongyang citizens saw South Korea President.  Not bad.

@annafifield Founder smoke pot would you honestly like to ride SpaceX rocket into space??? I'll pass.
@JChengWSJ @38NorthNK @fcaidan Past 70 years if North and South Korea had no Wars.  That is a very big accomplishment because the political boundary between North and South is one piece of brick road in DMZ.
@newsjean Can you really expect a fast rapid change for Kim Jung Un? ( His head is on the line). We expected same bullshit from North Korea for past 70 years.   Just " Ghetto State" has been isolated from the rest of the world for past 70 years.  Why cannot South Korea News media be honest
@hj257 A moment in time.  North Korea Human Right Issues has limit.
@annafifield Love Sandra Oh ( All time great Korean Canadian actress).

@Breaking911 Power of Nature.
@TheJihyeLee @CrazyRichMovie @warnerbros_kr Are you serious????? You call it a movie " Crazy Rich Asians"  bunch of Chinese white washed couple pretending to be rich.   I am glad Korea is not releasing it.  It gives all Asians bad reputations.
@BBCLBicker That is real genuine Chicken Soap.  Pour Ginseng Whiskey on the soap it tastes terrific.
@Newsweek Out of all the people.  Do you actually believe Mexican Hispanic girl saying this????????????
@Breaking911 She needed to suck.  I see her performing her duty inside the Jail.

@JChengWSJ Japan always will be haunted by Korean ghosts.
@Breaking911 Clearly see.  The dog has no idea.
@AlastairGale @AndreaRBerger Meaning ( Social Network).
@Breaking911 Okay, we get the idea.  Take a hot shower.

@MissMiaKang Yup, be aware.  You are in NYC.  Do not walk around in Park.  You can die.
@MaxCRoser United Korean Peninsula population surpass UK, Italy, Canada, population.  Not bad.
@WTFFacts Drinking Water or Ice Coffee will not kill you.  Alcohol and Candy bars.  Yes.
@samkimasia It would be wiser for President Moon. To hire her as interpretation.  Give her a double income job.
@willripleyCNN They need to sell the Hotel to South Korea.  We can do it much better make it into the Hotel or Office.
@nypost Disgusting.   Would they receive threesome in Jail or massive beat down?????
@LynnKawano Nice.

@chadocl So many stories and rumors.   Russia now North Korea????
@Breaking911 Come on.  Isn't that black ghetto life.
@tokyoreporter The guy reminds me someone on Youtube.
@rpcward89 Fits perfect with Ex-President Park Chung Hee model.  Just perfect.
@oinkorea Prince was under Japan ( Spy Supervision) and Prince American Queen wife.  Never had children.  Last time I heard.  They both had a child but child die in Korea.  Sad news. RIP.  Gosh.  I never have known she lived in Hawaii.  RIP.
@willripleyCNN North Korea needs Economic change.  Not military.
@oinkorea Too late than never.   Accurate information about sex is crucial in Korea.
@MissMiaKang Like the middle.  I like a firm healthy woman.  Not tree thin or elephant fat.
@BuckTurgidson79 They all should be Businessman with a suitcase.
@rpcward89 @nvanderklippe It says " Only Time will tell being Economic Power House".   North Korea should follow President Park Chung Hee Economic Model.  My all-time best advice for North Korea Kim Jung Un.  Model fits perfect for North Korea.
@ArmsControlWonk @AlastairGale Not a deal but North Korea can become " East Asia Isreal" if they used head correctly. But that opportunity is gone now because of Kim Jung Un threat USA, South Korea, and Japan.  Trust is a very big factor difference between North Korea and Isreal.
@willripleyCNN @CNN North Korea need massive change.  Going forward with Military to Economy and Business.  North Korea is losing out lots of opportunity in Business Money Making World.
@KoreanUpdates Do you know BAP means " Rice Cooker" in Korean?  You know Bap Tong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@Draylien @JChengWSJ Outside of Pyongyang think???? ( North Korea people outside of Pyongyang) do you really think they care about this circus clown celebration????????????????
@NoonInKorea @DrMarkPBarry Communist Party arrives and she smiles while 25 million North Koreans starve and live like Ghetto.  So 70 years of celebration of what?????
@motokorich @Naomi_Osaka_ She is Half Japanese or Japanese???? What does Japan think??? Just 💪👍 a very superficial way looking at Champion.
@allyjung @edwardesjones @AFP Feel sorry for the people.  70 years of Garbage Parade.   People living in Ghetto for past 70 years.
@willripleyCNN NK need rapid change especially ( Kim Jung Un leadership and old Kim Followers).  South Korea and U.S. News Media accurately need to portray North Korea for change.   Stop portray Kim Jung Un as a smart and strong leader.  Past 70 years NK never been smart they have been a dog!!!
@DrMarkPBarry Reality birthplace for all Koreans.  Not only North Korea Kim.
@GlobalAsianista The reason why North Korea fails every time.   Past 70 years there is no improvement.
@ftasia Money bribe game.
@oinkorea Hong Kong Chinese isn't Korean let's make it clear.  Especially over steroid user ( Hong Kong Kung Fu actor).
@MissMiaKang I lost in MMA a long time ago.  The only thing that releases my stress is you.
@willripleyCNN You are back in Town!!!!! I wish for low key 70 years celebration for North.  70 years self-isolation is what got themselves into trouble.  I wish and hope they realize the reality.  People's mind, Attitude, Nation, has to change move forward for prosperity.
@tokyoreporter But South Korea Men ( Baseball) got the Gold Medal in Asian Game 2018.
@Robert_E_Kelly Does " History repeating itself" meaning this......
@enews Dude is Back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@WTFFacts Take a shower natural way.  Use quality shampoo and soap.  All you need.
@KTLA Fugitive does not know " Texas Law" well.
@motokorich The game score should have been 3-1 but anyway South Korea won Gold Medal.  Rooms for improvement.  Anyway good job.
@theKFA The game should have been score 3-1.  Rooms for improvement.  But South Korea won Gold Medal good job.
@1SnoozyQ I agree 100 percent.  We call it " Back Stabber in the House" or " I smell a rat".
@Newsweek More like cultural mocking moves.
@NoonInKorea Problem:  No Jobs in South Korea. North Korea his Mother policy ( Without No South Korea support " Only Communist Sympathy"  Koreans from Cholla Province,  Chinese in Korea,  Koreans from China,  Anti Americans) all combined together represents less than 1% Koreans in South Korea
@theKFA South Korea need a Gold Medal.
All-time KISS favorite Album: Love Gun, Destroyer,  Alive, Alive II.   My favorite best.
Korea needs pouring Rain or pouring Snow.
@oinkorea Love, Marriage, Sex ( All three are separate things).Paul Stanley ( Kiss frontman) once said.  Any brainless man can get a pussy, but can he find love? and settled down get married be a responsible man?! ( his opinion was directed at Gene Simmons) he was known to fuck around.
@oinkorea Again South Korea has no clue.
@BryanDruzin Koreans want a straight couple.  Men liking Woman or Woman liking Men.
@insight_co_kr 대한민국 외사 설명 부적 인정.   미국 가새요.   미국 정문가 가새요.
@theKFA Not sure to be sad or happy.
@AlastairGale Just let Japan spend Military increasing amount.  North Korea has a justifiable reason to keep Nuclear Missile Program.  See cause and effect angle only will make North Korea keep not dismantle Nuclear Missile.  North Korea can say for self-defense purposes.  Like Japan.
@chadocl Weak and Self Confused Person.   South Korea needs a much better person.
@DrMarkPBarry What is the story about South Korea wants to reduce U.S. Military station in South Korea is the angle coming from President Trump or President Moon administration????  reduce can cause one serious problem for South Korea and for East Asia.
@davidvolodzko Well, North Korea Nuclear Submarine is in next door a few minutes away.  Can North Korea defend it??????  Common Sense.  Everybody loses in Nuclear War.  Should North Korea focus on Nuclear Weapon????  Focus on Economy and Trade makes more sense.
@BuckTurgidson79 @voxdotcom North Korea isolated for past 70 years.  Being angry.  North Koreans should blame Kim Jung Un that made them be angry!!!!!!!!!!!! Isolation hurts people mind.  Nobody gains from isolation including people, nation, culture, and language.
@newsjean Attitude from both North and South that needs to be balanced for them to unify. For past 7 years, South Korea only looked and talk about economic imbalance or gap between two states. Trick here how you overcoming the gap is a major key point
@BuckTurgidson79 North Korea 70 years of isolation comes into play.
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington I miss MJ.
@CSISKoreaChair @CSIS @VictorDCha @TheWilsonCenter @newsjean @ann_e_babe @NPR @1a When will North Koreans wake up?  It has been over 70 years now.
@DrMarkPBarry Now you know the Fundamental cause of WW.II. and the attack on Pearl Harbor.
@chadocl Who voted for the fake???? Not me.
@motokorich @stevenleemyers The U.S. is very nearby Pacific ( Hawaii, Guam, Alaska)  also South Korea and Japan. Plus U.S. Submarine with Nuclear Weapon capability.
@theKFA 바보 패배.   현실은 need a new coach.   Coach makes a team and Coach makes the winning team by choosing the right qualified players for his or her team.  그래서 한국인 감독 은 안대.  ( 시각, 인지,  사고방식)  틀이다.   경기가 이길수없다!!!!!!!!!!!!! 명심하라!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@BenSasse At least you were lucky to have a picture with him.   RIP.
@MailOnline So the erection got wrong.
@JChengWSJ @Kwanwoo President Moon is sinking because he's not really thinking deeply what Koreans needs are at the moment.  What Koreans need is Jobs not brown nosing North Korea.
@BuckTurgidson79 are you surprised????? In a life or death situation.  Would you choose money over Nuclear weapon??????????????? Common sense tells me North Korea is 80 years late.
@chadocl Shows true character, Mad Man.
또 대한민국 여자 대표 선수 " 병신 실수" 대문내 일본 2-1 패배!!!!!!!! 참 .  한국 여자 추구팀 복이 없다 ( 감독 과 선수) 재수 없다!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

@JChengWSJ @DCSneider China and Russia ( Both nations wants Nuclear North Korea)  whereas Isreal ( American Lobby),  USA,  Japan ( Do not want Nuclear North Korea)  South Korea on another hand 50-50 Honestly.  South Korea imagine using the force against China and Japan.
@MissMiaKang look very horny.
@CSIS @CSISKoreaChair North Korea is ( Kim Jung Un) Mafia State.

@DrMarkPBarry Keep in mind.  China isn't helping.
@AlastairGale Seoul is always cooler than Tokyo.
@BryanDruzin Thinking is positive.  Not Over Thinking.  But Thinking Negative about everything is Human cancer.
@NBCNews He was warrior.
@MSNBC I admired his confidence and directness.
@motokorich @mikeives I wish them all the best.   If the Korean Peninsula were united.  Korea would be a second place already in Medal race.  This is what Korean Media should focus on.  What could have Korea accomplish if the nation were truly united as one?
@MSNBC He was direct and confident.  I admired.
I heard the news Sen. John McCain passed away 81 years old.  God bless you, sir.
@DrMarkPBarry @realDonaldTrump Korean Peninsula weather says.  Delay is fine.  Nobody wants Rain Wet Diplomacy ( Thousand Miles Trip).
@MissMiaKang Who do you miss???
@LynnKawano Much better than Volcano Lava.   Cool off the Lava.
@LynnKawano forming a pond.
@Seoul_gov If they cannot compete in Service, Quality, Let them fade away. Invest 4 billion in ( Simplify Seoul, Korea Traffic Lights) please. many small business establishments in Korea that people do not want to spend money. Wast of money and time letting unqualified business float.
@TimothyS clearly shows her attitude got her into deeper trouble.  Plus the fine.  Not a joke.
@koreanforeigner @JChengWSJ There are many options for skin care.  Let's not be biased.  Lotion, Soap, cosmetic care, it is your choice.  Giving choices to the people letting them decide is Democracy.  Unlike China, Russia, Cuba, Vietnam,  also North Korea.
@koreanforeigner @JChengWSJ Yeah, I agree.  The only Woman knows soldier or not.
@yonhaptweet That Psychopath deserves 35 years in Jail.
@LynnKawano I wish everybody the best.
@koreatimescokr Can Lotte handle the Typhoon?
@LynnKawano Body language says it all.
Korean Peninsula ( Summer Weather) has been hot and humid.  Typhoon is coming to Korea.  Like it or not.  Korea does need heavy rain.
@ftasia Ugly ass car.
@Caroline__K_ Can North Korea " inconsistency"  be trusted??????? Fundamental questions all Koreans must ask about President Moon policy.
@TheKoreaHerald Hard truth.  Past 70 years.  No fundamental changes inside North Korea.  70 years World Isolation has hurt the people inside North Korea.  The fact all Koreans must understand and not repeat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Learn the TRUTH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@oinkorea World largest base.  Pyeongtaek.
@oinkorea What Seoul needs. All Korean city needs Monorail System.  Plus Seoul Mayor can move his ass and simplify all Seoul City traffic light system or Improve Seoul Traffic light system.  It would help tremendously!!!! Again Current Seoul Mayor will sit on his ass do nothing like always
@MissMiaKang Like to see your mama
@oinkorea Sunny Day like today in Seoul, Korea soon be full of Rain.   Korean Peninsula being dry, hot, and humid.   Korea needs rain.
@BuckTurgidson79 Wow.
@MissMiaKang lmao.
@oinkorea Moon, Trump, Xing,  all line up to meet Kim Jung Un.
@Breaking911 Another Hot day.
@koreanforeigner South Korean Nationalist.  Not Assasin.  There is very big differences.  First to begin with it is time Korean Newspaper get mentally straight with Korean History and beyond.
@elisewho What a golden week.
@MissMiaKang look hot.
@DEADLINE Kung Fu.
@oinkorea Hope for Rain cool off the heat.   Think Snow.
@martfack Christ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@oinkorea You mean " Anal Sex Pat"  in South East Asia.  Especially in Philippine, Thailand, Taiwan, Okinawa, Japan, and China.   South Korea is missing believe me.   All sexpat were kicked out or expelled in South Korea aka Korean Peninsula.  Do not imagine North Korea.
@MetroUK_Life @MetroUK Adult male becoming baby is not by their choices.  Mental disability can make them to be adult baby as well.   Keep an open mind.  It helps in learning about the past of that person.
@BryanDruzin New City needs to withstand Earthquake, Fire, Tsunami,  I think South Korea needs massive infrastructure structuring.  South Korea needs to simplify the City structure system.  Way too much overload in City concentration.
@TheKoreaHerald Fundamentally why only in Korea???? BMW Car recalls??????  Logic does not make any sense.  Don't you think it is drivers fault making the car engine overheated???? Air condition,  Not changing Gear,   Common sense says it is driver makes car long and lasting.  Not the car itself.
@NBCNews That is total BS.  Sperm Count.  Do not smoke or moderate drinking,  Walking exercise helps the most not " underwears".
@theKFA 남자 축구처럼 바보 실수 하지말아.   앞애 2승 노치는 경기 실수.

@Breaking911 The white woman wanted money really bad.  She steals it.  Stealing is American Phenomena.   North Korea clearly knows it well.
@oinkorea BTS in Tallest Building Cover.  That was pretty cool.
@sarahjeong Must be hot in NYC
@DailyMail Reckless action has a price to pay.
@CNNNSdigital RIP
@oinkorea hagwon expats do not represent all expats in South Korea or Korea.  Get that head straight.
@oinkorea Koreans can clearly tell differences between educated and uneducated expat.  Probably Neo-Nazi expat point of view toward South Korea and also about themselves.  Koreans call those idiots " Yellow Fever".  You know " Thailand" user finding themselves getting rejected by Koreans.
@BoxingKingdom14 Credit by Jade Pak.  I guess she is Korean.

@djpwertz @JChengWSJ The problem here is North Korean " People" are not liberated.  Still under 70 years Kim Family System Slavery.
@AlastairGale Japan for past 150 years.  From Meiji Period until the Year 2018.  Japan erased and changes history so many times.  Especially all racial, cultural, linguistic, historical, ties with Korean Peninsula.  Even though Meiji restoration tried to erase everything  Truth always prevails
@KasulisK 7 years reading news about the Korean Peninsula.  Balance perspective is seriously fundamentally needed.  I know it is very hard and difficult to report about Korea.  It needs well-balanced perspective.   Thank you for your good work.
@MissMiaKang Sexy bootie.  Love you too. Sweetie.
@allyjung The fundamental problem is Korean Law toward Sexually related crime.  Plus how Korean woman reports sexually related crime.
Happy Korea Independence Day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@yonhaptweet Fundamentally seriously wrong with Korean Law system.   I thought he raped and forced sexual intercourse with her?????? Isn't sexual rape or force rape a crime in South Korea/ Korea?????????????????????????????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@allyjung @AFP He was not charged????? Sexual abuse or Force Rape Sexual Intercourse?????? Then Korean woman sex/rape accuser must be one crazy mentally unstable person.  Something is seriously fundamentally wrong.   Is it woman accuser,  or Lawmaker!!!! Showing corruption at best.
@koreatimescokr Privacy Law!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! South Korea seriously need to step up.  20 year old guy belongs in Jail.

@THRGlobal Korean Drama plot for " White Washed Asian" to fit and blend in for American Audiences.  No Thank You.   The movie itself will bring a very negative drawback for all Asian ( Descent) American community.
@nktpnd Taiwan past will get you into very deep trouble.  Worse than Vietnam.  At least Vietnamese knew fundamentally they were not Chinese and fought for Independence.  Taiwan people are so confused lame ass backstabbing people.
Do not be surprised if actual South Korea/ South Korean population is 72 Million.  Not 52 Million.

@TIME 7 things to know about marriage:  Communication takes all 7 things for a marriage to last.
@FirstStepsOrg @AlastairGale can be much much better for these kids.

@oinkorea LMAO.
@SkyNews Summer dress Ninja.
@chadocl Was he Yakuza member trying to bride North Korean officials with Cocain???? it happens a few years ago.
@tokyoreporter River found in Fuk-U-oka.
@NoonInKorea If you cannot win a gold medal in the Asian Game.  You must not come back to South Korea for good.   Just pack your bag and leave Korea.
@NoonInKorea Saving face is winning the gold medal.
@JChengWSJ Thinking Snow or Thinking about Rain.  Is just right.
@nypost How many texting per day????
@chadocl What is North Korea ( Kim Jung Un) Government doing it about it????
@Newsweek lmao.
@NYDailyNews Crime ladder:  On the crime ladder.  He probably dies inside the Jail.  Worse kind of crime you can do and die inside the jail without any remorse.
@MissMiaKang Nip Hip.
이것이 현실이다.  북한 놈들은 " 병신" 이다.
@JChengWSJ Shows North Korea ( top leaders) are afraid.   They would be the first to loose power.
@ABC Made in China bed sheet in the act.
@10NewsHunt @ABC Did her friend pay her Medical cost???  A 16-year-old girl needs to get her head straight.
@MissMiaKang As long as you walk, work out, eat.  No problem.
@BryanDruzin Korean should be top 15 languages spoken.  If you use the year 2018 number should be about 90-110 Million.   Korean spoken in Korean Peninsula, Manchuria, Japan, Russian Far East also America.
@BryanDruzin German ( USA).  My honest intake.
@elisewho Well,  Mother, Father is ( Korean, Chinese, Japanese).   Mother, Father ( Non- Asian or Asian American).   Check Hapa or Bi-Racial.  OR simply American.
@elisewho Your back in Southern California.  Send us the Moonshine pic.
@freekorea_us Common Sense: Since 1994,2002,2005,2007,2012,  until 2018:  Has China and Russia signed a Nuclear Missile armistice with Kim Jung Un.  ( Meaning China and Russia will not AID or Send Nuclear Technology with North Korea regime????  I do not think so.  So which nations helping NK??
@JChengWSJ China and Russia should play a bigger role.  That is what " Common Sense" tells me.
@TheKoreaHerald Good Job.
@MissMiaKang @womenshealth Love You, sweetie.  You look great.
@soulofseoulblog Looks cool. Is the bag real or is it picture???
@DrMarkPBarry Coal ship got confused with South Korea with North????
@Kwanwoo @JChengWSJ Competition is always good.  Simply South Korea Car manufacturers need to make much better quality cars.  From Engine Power, Safety, and Comfort.   Hyundai and KIA have ignored real car market for a long time.  They seriously need to wake up!!!!!
@TheKoreaHerald Winter Season is longest in Korea.   Seoul Mayor should wise up and use common sense.  If he has any.   Time and Money consuming Seoul Stupid Mayor.
@chadocl Missile and Technology made in Russia.
@StarAdvertiser @USGSVolcanoes Careful of Lava blob.  It can kill you.
@BBCLBicker Where Korean Mountains plays a big role.  All the trees wind blows in right directions.
@andreilankov Did Russia ever signed arms control with Kim Jung Un???  Did China ever signed arms control with Kim Jung Un???? Common sense tells me China and Russia should sign arms control with North Korea.  What do you think????
@freekorea_us Called National Security not Anti-left-wing anything.
@koreatimescokr Called people to change in America or American Diet changes people.
@BBCLBicker Just accept it as " Korea Times" reason why nobody reads it or nobody takes Newspaper company seriously.  We call it a " Joke company funded by Cholla Province".   Company is known for Pro-China, Pro-Communist stance,  Pro-North. Anti-America, Anti-Japan, Anti-Democracy.
@tokyoreporter See again.  If that doesn't murder what is.   Again just imagine how many Koreans have died in Japan in that " uncivilized" manner.  Again the majority of Japan Law Maker would deny it as " extremely malignant".   Typical Fascist Japan in the act.
@GlobalAsianista Chosun Dynasty ( outdated system and outdated way of looking at the World) made the price for Chosun to be between the Empires.  A smarter way to look at it.
@motokorich Just imagine in Okinawa or Taiwan at the moment.  I thought Korea was bad.  Thank God for No Tsunami,  No " Major" Earthquake, or even Major Heatstroke.  The only Natural disaster we have is Kim Jung Un/ North Korea &amp; outdated system.
@JChengWSJ Final Conclusion:  without progress.  Can a nation be happy???? Fundamentally KCNA should question 25 Million people up North.
@MissMiaKang Show me your thigh. Sweetie.
@insight_co_kr 변태 놈 아닌지?????????????????  그 놈 변태 라고 인정했읍니가????????????
@willripleyCNN Keep the dialogue going that's a good news.  The process of Kim Jung Un/ Denuclearization going to take time.  As long as Russia and China backing Kim Jung Un.  Trust is much more important between the USA and North Korea.  TRUST!!!!!! and DIALOGUE.!!!!!
@thinkdefence A gift to Indonesia.
@MissMiaKang Sexy Lip.
@willripleyCNN War with Nature.
@insight_co_kr Like a Movie.
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington Attacking Robot.  Sounds like from Science Fiction movie.
@NoonInKorea Fundamental Point:  We must deliver in any News article.  No Nuclear Power Nation ( With or Without)  Nuclear missiles.  Threat United States or Threat neighbor nations.  If Japan used threat. They would not allow 47 tons of plutonium.
@koreatimescokr People should always think twice ( Cult Ritual).  Why????? Ritual does not make any sense!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! USE COMMON SENSE PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT THINK AND ACT CLUMSY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@koreatimescokr Change your gear properly next time.  I see many foreign car Korean drivers put Gear 2 level when they drive freeway.  When your car engine makes noise ( restraining noises) it means your car engine is burned out.
@stiles @Google Called living your life in " Border" line.
@JChengWSJ Being tricked can happen in Korea.  Please ask him being tricked or not.  Would North Korea restaurant workers and managers be happy in North Korea????  That is fundamental questions we should all ask them.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@koreatimescokr How about changing gear when they drive.  When an engine overheats it can backfire.
@willripleyCNN NOT DPRK.  WHICH NATIONS SUPPORTING THIS BEHAVIOR.  WHICH NATION IS OKAYING IT!!!!!! AGAIN CHINA AND RUSSIA!!!!!!! CNN NEED TO REPORT AND LOOK AT ALL / WIDER GLOBAL ANGLE!!!!!
@michellak90 Look she smiled like a spoiled white idiot.  She sat in the business class seat she hasn't even paid for what a " Privileged" spoiled white bitch!!! Giving all Koreans a bad image toward the city of San Francisco not even departed from Incheon city Airport. Congratulations idiot!
@RobotikaAutomat @EdwardHBOh Who' who killing Millions of Koreans /Million of Korean genocide.  Much worse than Imperial Japan or Fought for Syngman Rhee's regime.  NK Kim Jung Un ( Regime) or SK under the Democratic/ Capitalist regime.  I think North Korea Mafia State or Fascist Japan is same Nutt case!!!!!
@KathyHSMoon @Harvard Asian-American ( terminology) is wrong.  Simply you are the encouraging majority of Americans whitewash all Asians into one category of regions.  STOP USING ASIAN AMERICAN.  Asia is far more complicated than average White Americans think!!!!!
@AlastairGale @WSJ Let them work in Russia.  At least they will have exposure to the world.
@GlobalAsianista Korean Government official sitting down the third seat.  Show the picture all angle in next time.  Make it better for people to understand the " Fundamental" aspect of Koreans.  Fundamentally you are not making it any better.
@themichellewie Health matters the most.  The tournament is always their next time.  Not Health.  Keep yourself and be healthy.  Health matters the most.
Chinese company name Huawei copied " Note" brand name from Samsung. This is seriously fundamentally wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@Newsweek Small baby penis.
@MailOnline If you marry a Chinese woman this is what it happens.
@EdwardHBOh Yup, past 70 years imagine how many Koreans sacrificed their lives.  Like I said many times.  God bless that the majority of Koreans live and work in South Korea.
@OhMyGOFF In da hood.
@OhMyGOFF @SheenaParveen @nbcwashington Flash Flood................. at least you guys have water pouring.  Heat and Humidity driving me crazy.  Starbucks Ice Americano is life saver ^^.
@jendehuang @freekorea_us Government intervenes with Business.  Only in China.
@TheJihyeLee Weather is not a joke.   Seoul, Korea weather hotter than South East Asia.  No Joke.
@MissMiaKang All Math.
@elisewho Goodbye.  You will find Korea in L.A. for sure.
@DEFCONWSALERTS Coming from whom makes a very big difference.
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington Isn't there far too many guns in the USA.  Not sure this is encouragement or discouragement.
@MissMiaKang You call it Thug punch.
@ABC Terrible.  I wish them all the best.
@chadocl What would happen if average North Korea citizens know the truth about South Korea?  Plus is People living in South Korea helping people up North to know the truth???  This is the biggest irony of all.  South Korea not doing enough, to tell the truth, people up North.
@EdwardHBOh lipstick. 👄💋💄
@TheJihyeLee The problem here is like Seoul Mayor knows..............................about it.
@chadocl They need Samsung and LG phones ASAP.
@BBCLBicker Past 70 years China and Russia.  On North Korea.
@BryanDruzin Biggest does not mean the best.  Perfect example China and India.
@MailOnline The month of August only 5 months until the end of the year.  Stay smart people.
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington Using the power in wrong ways.  Rape, Stealing, Shop Lifting,  Child Porno, is a serious crime.  Typical White People crime overseas overlooked in Domestic White America.  White breeding White Crime in " Overseas" and " Domestic" America.
@MissMiaKang Mia, you belong in Playboy Centerfold sweetie.
@PomKlementieff Past haunts the Present.   Director does hurt the image of the franchise.   Even though the first two movies were good.   Volume 3 I would not mind Thor director directs the movie.
@nypost crazy.
@BBCLBicker Idiot.  My wife is Irish ooh sorry I mean English.
@freekorea_us @nktpnd @thedailybeast In Truth.  Kim Jung Un will give up Nuclear Weapon/ Missile Program.  The reason is that is the only solution card that Kim Jung Un has for the future of North Korea.  President Trump needs to attack Syria Assad ( State).  Not Iran.  Attacking Iran would be a terrible mistake.
@nypost Call the police.  The guy is a complete Psychopath.
@motokorich How stupid can someone get???? All these years confused his wife with Chinese and Japanese.  Please do not say his wife is Korean.
@allyjung @AFP South Korea woman must figure out.  1) Sexual related forced rape.  2) Sexually related murder.  Not rape.  3) Forced Sex.  4) Underage Sexual related rape. 5) Stalking, Rape, and Murder.
@EdwardHBOh Edward oh " Holy Bible".!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@MissMiaKang You call it " Male Eater"  aka " Bukake"
@tictoc I would rather have Sushi of in Seoul, Korea.  Half the price of better quality.  No half biting cake lovers.
@cnni Blame on Syria Assad.  One running lunatic.  Much worse than Kim Jung Un.  Much worse.
@koreatimescokr The reason why North Koreans have rising increase Leukemia White blood cell cancer and TB disease.
@tokyoreporter Just old and boring.

@MissMiaKang 12 hours is enough.
@MissMiaKang NYC for fashion.  LA for Korean food.
@MetroUK Stupidity at best.  Hot water challenge.  WTF.
@yonhaptweet Human Dog.
@MissMiaKang Korean BBQ much better.  I do admit I do once in a while want Tuna Roll.
@DrMarkPBarry North Korea should follow Ex President Park Chung Hee model. Model fits better for North Korea. Remember Vietnam as a whole and majority of people are communist whereas Majority of Koreans living and working in the Korean Peninsula are the democratic/capitalist system.
@MailOnline What a site.
@mpspavor @NAR Better to say Korean Peninsula as a whole is not another China.
@Breaking911 He's a Marine. Show some respect.
@Breaking911 Hey, His a Marine. Don't Kill me.
@MorningExp @willripleyCNN Today Four buses of Korean War Vet arrived today. Escorted by South Korea police and South Korea medical ambulance. North Korea is doing there best it has been 70 years.  North Korea not being inconsistent. Channel your eyes toward China/Russia you will get 50% of your answers.
@MailOnline Rat worm??????????? Does not exist in Korea.
@nypost Life of stripper.  Well known facts.
@NME Becky with the good hair means Anal Sex.
@YonhapNews @TheJihyeLee He deserves 7 years at least for abusing his power for sex.
@LynnKawano The U.S. military base in Hawaii had history " Human Traffic" underage prostitution.  Hawaii, Okinawa, Alaska,  Las Vegas has history U.S. military involvement in sex trade business.
@sahluwal Do not drink it.  Buy bottled water for sure.
@ABC Summer Time in White America.
@willripleyCNN Three buses or more Korean War Vets arrived in Seoul.
@MissMiaKang Just sushi fish is effected with radiation in Japan.  The reason why Japanese people started eating Korean BBQ 50 years ago.
@MailOnline Indian father ( Next Friday the 13th).
@BuckTurgidson79 Probably smartest picture.  Shows his working at least.  Unlike past military parade and office picture ( those days are over).
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington You need to have trust.   Uber driver has bad track records meaning untrustable.
@MissMiaKang Nice.
@hj257 Never in doubt.  Must read what is the message behind all of this. Clearly shows North Korea never forgotten Japan Military Fascism fundamental root to all evil.
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington Busy day.
@insight_co_kr 진실 하면서 슬프다.  남자 가 편지 약속 증말 힘들다.  99.9% 남자 편지 약속.  나도 남자 이지만.  편지 약속 안낸다.   끝가지 약속하기가 증말 힘들다.
@willripleyCNN North Korea does not need Nuclear Missile to be a power player in the region. Two option. 1) Korean Unification or 2) North goes forward with rapid economic reform. Use Geography and Natural Resources for there own Political, the Economic advantage
@MissMiaKang Happiness comes within sweetie.
@StormyDaniels People are afraid of the truth.  Knowing the truth helps people to progress.
@BCG South Korea is Green Nice.
@ABC How many hours can you fly????
@EdwardHBOh Thanks to the  China and Russia.  That is the final conclusion.  You need to start thinking in bigger picture who is behind Kim Jung Un ( NOT NORTH KOREA PEOPLE) always it has been China Communist Party and Putin Russian Party.
@willripleyCNN North keeping the promise.  Trump threatens Iran.  Putin threatens the USA.  Not good.
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington Crazy Sinkhole.  If we only can switch weather.   Rain here please.  Cool the heat.
@MissMiaKang Nice. Sweetie.
@CNNNSdigital Wooden Tooth Brush.  Next thing.
@DrMarkPBarry Demonstrate for increase use for condom access,  stop " China" narrow mind " Confuscius" Sex Education.  That polluted Koreans for the past 500 years ( Chosun Dynasty).  Koreans must understand Sex is part of life not Tabboo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@oinkorea Show it to the police to get him arrested for Racial Harassment.  If not hire the lawyer and sue his ass.  He looks like a typical Jewish.

@MissMiaKang Bootie attention is always good and healthy.
@bopinion Samsung and Volkswagon are tied.  I do not see LG, Hyundai, and KIA.  Final conclusion except for Samsung.  Rest of South Korea company lack R&amp;D research.  Very sad.
@nypost Popular in Japan.  They love plastic rubber toys and Cartoons.
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington Very Hot and Humid day in L.A.  It can get very scorching hot.  Reason why LAPD has limited patience.  So watch out.
@JChengWSJ Samsung 5G!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@JChengWSJ All Angle was coming from Jewish American Lobby.  Not President Trump.  Keep that in mind when you talk or write about U.S. foreign policy toward North Korea.  Common sense tells me the U.S. has no foreign policy toward North Korea. The fundamental problem for the past 70 years.
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington Korea needs pouring rain.  Monsoon Season was way to short.  Feels like South East Asia here!!!!!!  Love Rain and Snow.
@DrMarkPBarry USA blood economy runs deep in America.  The problem here is President Moon is fundamentally weak president.
@DrMarkPBarry President Trump China and Russia using North Korea ( Missile) card as East Asia aka North East Asia  USA Political, Military, Economic,  balance card between ( China, Russia,  vs USA ( Military, Economic, Political,  Supremacy) Kim Jung Un/ North Korea buffer zone tool. As a tool
@MissMiaKang You do not like it Male person calls you Queen????  Queen is much better than Queer.  Please keep that in mind.
@JohnDelury Kim Jung Un can be very frustrated.  He cannot follow the line ( President Trump and Kim) promised.  Same line with Pompeo because of China and Russia.   China and Russia pressuring Kim Jung Un not to go fast not get too close with USA.  Which nations NK need the most USA and SK!
@StateDept @JChengWSJ @SecPompeo @USUN Problem  is China and Russia.  North Korea receiving bad end of the stick.   Kim Jung Un ( North Korea) massively stupid and sandwiched.
@themichellewie Sexy Bootie Queen.
@DrMarkPBarry North Korea not thinking straight.  President Moon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@SBS8news 40-50대는 아니다.
@Newsweek She trying silently in a family feud.  Probably smartest and brightest idea.   It is called jealousy.
@ABC Arab World including Iran doing nothing about it.  Final Conclusion.
CNN:  Does South Korea Loner culture means.  Girl wearing clown nose, burning books,  foldable furniture.   South Korea 24 hours nations do not sleep.  I doubt seriously it is a Korean woman that is alone.  Try American expat next time.  Might be believable.
@Newsweek Problem here though his son looks like Mexican.
@Broembach @OhMyGOFF I am holding the same size coffee cup.
@LeCinephiles Looks disgusting.  In the end.  Mouth taste like black chocolate buns and chocolate potato.
@JChengWSJ @Lkhagva Keep in Mind:  No such thing as North Korea,  Kim Il Sung, Kim Jung Il, Kim Jung Un, all Kim family belong in Superficial State backed by China and Russia making North Korea as " Buffer Zone"  between Communist vs Capitalist World.
@davidvolodzko Show North Korea system is backward and uneasy.  This is what it all means.   Remember everything has " Cause and Effect" in North Korea.
@chadocl All of them got assinated by South Korea troops when they came down.
@oinkorea Delta Airline is known for Racism.
@tokyoreporter I hate noises too but not to that extent.  Plus I realize Japan has many " Ghost Towns"  like the city of the dead.
@MailOnline Made in Russia.
@ABC Suicidal Child. Wow.
@tokyoreporter You cannot hide it or help it.  Sex is an addiction.  Japan Adult Video Industry clearly show it well.  Using drug to hide your Sex addiction.  Logically it does not work.
@GlobalAsianista Korea Summer Time.
@AlexJensenNews Nice picture.
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington Huge loss in Men Figure Skate.  It was last year I watched him skate with Yuna Kim.  Ice Show.  Sad day for all of ISU world.

@nypost He had to touch her in the restaurant.
@LynnKawano A person is running wild.
@DAminJun9 @koreatimescokr @ISU_Figure Dennis Ten should have called the police.  $20 Dollar worth of plastic mirror worth his life?????????????
@CNNMoney South Korea can turn North Korea economy forward very fast.  If North just open up.
@willripleyCNN , The world is not laughing.  Not funny.
@ABC The dog is Boy best friend.
@MailOnline Only in Japan.
@MailOnline Children are born to be slaves.
@JChengWSJ @Kwanwoo North Korea needs South Korea.  Not Kim Jung Un posing picture with children and fake soldiers.
@LynnKawano Catch him ASAP.   Love and Peace.
@MissMiaKang My type.
@Ian56789 Called brainwashing.  Remember World were dealing with different kinds of Germans.  Much more fearsome than North Koreans.  Germans during WW.II was brainwashed " War machines".
@BBCLBicker I realize ( the group) is having North Korea " Can" buffet.  Keep in mind not being sanitization.
@chadocl Problem with North Korea " Can" food.   Not sanitized.  Keep that in mind.
@BBCLBicker Winter Food in Korea.  Not during summer.
@Robert_E_Kelly President Trump finally realized who is behind Kim Jung Un aka North Korea Missile program are China and Russia.  Using North Korea as leverage toward U.S. foreign economic and political policy.  Kim Jung Un being sandwiched. Final Conclusion.
@RealMuckmaker Give me 10.
@motokorich We banning ride sharing because Uber had history psychopath drivers.  So who is more stupid Softbank or Uber investor????
@tokyoreporter Welcome to the land of rising sun.  Yup work begins at 7 A.M.

@OhMyGOFF @Reagan_Airport @ArlingtonVaFD @nbcwashington wow, the flood is happening around the world.
@SkyNetDirector Putin is a Spook.
@OhMyGOFF @Nationals @nbcwashington Nice job.
@DrMarkPBarry Common sense tells me China and Russia want Kim Jung Un to be Buffer Zone Puppet state.  The problem here is Kim Jung Un and Western world wants it that too.  Including U.S. administration.  Only fall out is South Korea. Koreans themselves not doing enough like German Unification
@mpsbell Those were probably bad times.  Once North Korea economy was better days compared to South Korea.   After the Korean War.  When Philippine Banana was prestige fruit in South Korea days.  Those days are long gone in South Korea.  Many have died in North Korea or return to Japan!!!
@MissMiaKang Let your mind rest and sleep. Follow what your body says.  Best advice.
@deanna_florio @AutismTalkASD Autism is a lifetime.  The reason why I worry.
@nypost Not brave but stupid.  If you play with nature or wild animals.  Always a bad thing will happen.  It is all about common sense.  Humans cannot survive in wild animal territory.
@DrMarkPBarry End Korean War,  North Korea has official USA diplomatic relationship, the USA helps North Korea move forward.  Enough with 70 years buffer zone China and Russia bullshit.  People in North Korea need South Korea/ USA help.  Drastic change is needed.  North Korea follow Viet model
@mariashriver @DeadlineWH Arnold ( Ex Husband) was not thrilled.  He does have big point.
@SkyNews Arnold, you have a point.  Wow, for the first time.  You sounded very serious.
@chadocl Kim Jung Un ( Sandwiched) between should changed or should not change fast.   Line with President Trump/ Pompeo or  Take in China and Russia pressure.  If I were Kim Jung Un.   Just take South Korea/ USA economic alliance speed, up the recovery. Screw China and Russia.  NK 70shit
@DrMarkPBarry Not may.  North Korea is returning U.S. remains.  Plus how about U.S. servicemen defected to North Korea remains???? aren't they American?????? Remain should be buried in U.S. soil defected or not.
@Robert_E_Kelly @freekorea_us Russia ( Economy Size) is smaller than South Korea.
@FrancysBELLE @ValeBiancoxx @AngelEmilyxxxx Nice.  Anal Queen.
@MailOnline The thing with Burka wear.   Does not blend well with Western European Culture / North America included.  Even in South Korea, it looks odd.  Hot Humid South Korea weather these people wear all black Ninja clothes.  Looks odd.
@chadocl About time.  How about U.S. Military defected to North Korea???
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington @NBCDFW Clearly shows Texas coast has massive sharks.
@LynnKawano One of those days.  No light.
@Breaking911 Fucking Frenchy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@Breaking911 Celebrating the France World Cup win, is it?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@hankookilbo When will South Kothe rea/ Korea ever be in that World Cup situation????? probably never.  So far Brazil, Germany, Italy, France,  won the World Cup.  South Korea won final four in 2002 World Cup in Korea.  South Korea should have finished top 3 at least.
@TheKoreaHerald Time South Korea/ Korea stop Dog import.  Face it Koreans do not have patience, money, responsablity, to own pets or dogs.  It is not in Korean blood/ DNA.
@ABC Phone shake says it all.
@RealMuckmaker Differences between British and American custom and culture.
@YonhapNews Just my opinion.  Not a big fan.
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington That is what I need at the moment.  Korea Summer is Hot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thinking of snow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@MissMiaKang Respect goes both ways.  Respect is never one way.
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington crazy.
@tokyoreporter He was helping his penis/ Penis, Happy guy.
@nypost Pressured???? Like Kim Jung Un / North Korea is pressured to build and shoot Nuclear Missiles.  It does not make him any justifiable for his actions.
@tictoc @technology South Korea should never rely on China and Russia.  Two Nations using North Korea as a buffer zone while China and Russia get rich.
@TheKoreaHerald Smart idea.  Idiot mayor better knows what Seoul citizens want.  Past 8 years he has been too lazy to fix.
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington Classic case of self-stupidity.  Lost $300K in one ride.
@teddy_vg @FahySandra Comthe mon sense tells me China and Russia are a communist ruling state.  As long People inside North Korea do not accept the reality that Kim Jung Un leadership is corrupt and backward.  That is final destination innocent people in North Korea will receive.  Bad end of the stick
@MissMiaKang Be smart who you adventure the world with.  For example, swimming with a shark, walk with a lion, going to South America.  Not being smart.  Having Adventure or Putting yourself in a dangerous situation that you ( yourself) cannot get out of are two different things.  Be aware!!!
@MissMiaKang Do not try to satisfy all people.  Never going to happen.  Be happy with what you have and move on.   Be positive mind thinking straight person.  Good or Bad.  Those are the people who become the winner in the end.
@TheKoreaHerald Export market economy.
@ChloeKim Family time always a necessary tool.
@DrMarkPBarry Here is a reality.  What is Kim Jung Un doing about it???????????????????????
@OhMyGOFF @NBCNews Frank Sinatra is such a legend.
@IndivisibleNet This is what War does to you.  It makes you a hero vs rest are enemy.
@SungYoonLee1 Rest went to Kim Jung Un pocket.
@MailOnline It is India and China.  Same solution.
@_mhaley4 @AutismTalkASD Learning is never too old.
@nypost Her eyes say a lot.
@ABC Police are wrong using taser toward the Autistic person.  What is wrong with the Police Department in America.  It is becoming " Fundamentally Wrong Department".
@TheJihyeLee cross eye people.
@TheJihyeLee Taiwan parade.
@USEmbassySeoul @sqcforg I will bet you 100 percent ambassador Harris want them or recruit them in Military Bootcamp.
@freekorea_us Common sense tells me yes.  The reason is China and Russia holding Kim Jung Un hands.
CNN News clearly has a serious fundamental problem with History and Geography.  Why was it Japan flood so deadly? Why was it Japan flood so deadly because Japan is Island plus Geographical and Natural resource was number 1 reasons why they wanted to invade the Korean Peninsula!!!
@KatieHeigl @IamSandraOh @KillingEve I miss both of you.
@StormyDaniels Police said they made mistake.  If I were you.  Forget Columbus fans.   Come to Hawaii.  You need a break.
@oinkorea Thinking of Snow.
@StormyDaniels typo one-way direction.
@StormyDaniels How about customers wanting to touch you??? isn't that a crime too??? Why is it only way direction? Any sexual contact or consent goes both ways.  All crimes or criminal activity never one way.
@willripleyCNN Positive mind news.
@ABC I wish and hope she gets out.  How about the person who touched her???? That person should get arrested too.  Not only her.
@MichaelAvenatti I am happy for her release.  Be strong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington Stormy Daniels got arrested.
@CNN What can anything go wrong posting next to the shark.
@AskAKorean He is such a " Fat Ass Punk"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@chadocl No short-term progress because China and Russia both pressuring Kim Jung Un/ North Korea not to think in short term.  Going to be dragged out long term.   Do not think Kim Jung Un/ North Korea as Disneyland Mickey Mouse.  This ain't Hollywood.
@hankookilbo 국내 쪽팔 색이!!!!!!!!!!!!! 대만 국적 국내 화교 아닌지???????????????????????
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington @taylorswift13 @Robert_Ellis3 Have fun.  Nice.
@MailOnline That is murder.  Not a fight.
@BuckTurgidson79 Common Sense tells me.  The U.S. troops will never leave South Korea.  The reason is that is the backbone of the U.S. and South Korea relationship.  Military economy and Democracy that holds 70 years policy and beyond.  It is stupid for North Korea, China, Russia play poker card.
@oinkorea Who created the Jeju No Visa Policy.  South Korea Government policy got there ass kicked.
@oinkorea Upcoming Taiwan festival.
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington Love and Peace.  Soccer boys I wish you all the best.
@elisewho Meanwhile, if South Korea Government include naturalized Korean citizenship South Korea population would be about 60 Million.  If SK Government includes naturalized citizens not counted it would be about 70 Million already.
@GIKorea Nobody an is playing.  China and Russia both pressuring Kim Jung Un not to take easy step.
@StormyDaniels You cannot define who is a whore or not because all the profession we sell.  You must be a whore too.
@LynnKawano Was he that desperate to choose the wrong partner for an affair.  The former police chief or not.  Having affair with policeman wife, not a smart idea.  Out of all people police chief's wife.  One of those kinds of guy.  Da Kind.
@yumi_asada Seeing Mt Fuji upside down.

@TheKoreaHerald If South Korea had a player like him.  Could have made World Cup final 16 round.
@SungYoonLee1 Common sense tells me Kim Jung Un family cannot visit the USA because whole superficial state North Korea is blacklisted.
@OhMyGOFF You are one sexy hip hop dancer.  I'm surprised.  You can dance.
@willripleyCNN President Trump attitude toward China and Russia is very vague.  So yeah, it can give North Korea Kim Jung Un many leg space.
@OhMyGOFF lmao.  So cute.
@LynnKawano Affair with MILF.
@wikitree 미친 놈들!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What would you do if " Kim Jung Un aka North Korea" is Sandwiched between the need to change and unable to change?   The reason why he cannot change too fast or walk in President Trump/ Pompeo line because China and Russia are watching too closely with Kim Jung Un.
@MailOnline The year 2018.  I agree.  It is getting stupid.  Spain should get rid of it.
@GIKorea I agree.
@AFPTokyo @AFP AFP Tokyo:  You should learn geography.   Japan is an Island like it or not.
@koreatimescokr If a person is mentally ill he needed help.
@StormyDaniels The Real Very Frank:  While you watch her Porno movies.  You are such a hypocrite.
7/8/2018: Youtube:  Official PSY:  Gangnam Style has reached 3,171,748,775 Billion viewers with 14 Million Likes.
@TheKoreaHerald Except for KPOP.   South Korea made Movie and TV Drama, TV shows lousy and it SUCKS.  Hard to watch.  The Internet is the only outlet in South Korea to entertainment and News.  Plus updated.
@TheKoreaHerald Bikini in South Korea is like during 1950's no different from the Muslim nation.  Totally embarrassing to watch and see.  Better to wear shorts and a T-shirt.
@chadocl Are you really honest sure he said it????
@TheKoreaHerald Stop saying Garlic girl.  It sounds stupid and offensive.
@TwitterMoments Wrestling match again...................... getting bored Brock Lesnar guy.  He should just go home already.  Not WWF Bullshit.
@Sala61620965 @MissMiaKang Hanging.  No Thank You.  Altaic Brother.  Are you Turkish??????????????
@ABC The black guy is a pimp.
@tongbingxue Which Japanese Government Abe does not fundamentally acknowledge that it existed.
@TheKoreaHerald The problem here e is Woman take picture of a man without his or her consent.  South Korea lacks or does not acknowledge " Privacy" that should be a bigger issue.  Watching or not watching is not the problem.  Problem is lack of South Korea law protecting " Privacy"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@KoreaExpose Fundamentally if you take a nude picture without the person knowing or without his or her consent.  It is a crime. South Korea police follow you around ( 미행) is a fundamental crime. The problem here is  Korea police or Korea Law does not know what crime means.
@willripleyCNN While I am listening to X Japan endless rain.
@allyjung @AFP Reality is South Korea News media lost in translation.  I have my doubts North Korea Government officials really said it.   북한이 양심히 있으면.   Do you know what I am saying??????????????????????????????????????
@TheKoreaHerald No need to flash it around.
@willripleyCNN Reality North Korea Government officials did not say " Gangster Like".   It was South Korea news media lost in English translation..........................
@tokyoreporter X Japan endless rain.
@VABVOX Common Sense tells me tremendous lost in translation coming out from South Korea News media.  If North Korea news media being quiet it means something.  Have patience listen to balance perspective news source when it comes out.  Balance perspective means  none of  CNN, FOX, CNBC,
South Korea " News Media" agency needs seriously qualified English translator that provides balance perspective on Korean Peninsula situation. They all lack trust and creditability.
@duyeonkim This is what I learned about South Korea " News" media.  Please translate to the point that Non-Korean can understand. No, undermine Koreans meaning North and South Korea.   South Korea English translator does a terrible job! Plus South Korea news is very unbalanced perspective.
@oinkorea Today Seoul, Korea weather is perfect.   Nice warm cool weather.  No need for a water gun.
What does North Korea mean " Regrettable" does 70 years isolated state know what regrettable means????? I think North Korea superficial state is regrettable.
@DrMarkPBarry Pompeo wants answers.
@ABC Who hits woman???????????? The black guy is a Pimp.
@stiles @duyeonkim Common sense tells me not going to be quick.  As long as China and Russia are holding left and right arm like puppet Kim Jung Un.  You need to cut the ties first to pace yourself.  Eventually, Kim Jung Un has no choice to cave in.
@OhMyGOFF Sexy " Evil Eye".
@MailOnline Nothing else but " Psycho Circus".
@SungYoonLee1 Common Sense:  If Pompeo feels North Korea not going to surrender its nuclear and ballistic missile program.  Why did Pompeo make three trips to North Korea???? a thousand miles ride with U.S. Tax money???? Your logic does not make any sense at all.
@GIKorea Why hospital????? they want free medicine??????????????????? sounds stupid.
@MayorHarryKim God Bless You, Mayor Harry Kim. God Bless you.
@mashable Do you seriously need it while you drive???? Dip into the food????? Sounds very stupid invention.
@TheEconomist @BarryPWelsh Kim Jung Un is not the one pulling the strings.  It is China pulling the left hand, and Russia in pulling the right hand.
Andy Dick endlessly touching Ivanka Trump leg.  He clearly shows why God gave him that name Andy DICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Person thinks and acts like a DICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@LynnKawano Looks very vulnerable.

@CNN @willripleyCNN CNN, Fox News, CNBC,  Warmongers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@stiles What a healthy decisions.
@oinkorea Opinion:  South Korea " Self-made" problem.  Who started " No VISA POLICY"!!!!! Time South Korea needs to get act together and focus on National Security.   SOUTH KOREA GOVERNMENT POLICY SELF MADE PROBLEMS!!!! 5 MILLION YEMEN REFUGEE/ ILLEGAL CHINESE IS THE OUTCOME!!!!!!
@TheKoreaHerald More like murdering woman.  Not dating abuse.   Please get your facts correct.
@TheKoreaHerald Using quality time.  Not cutting out hours.
@chadocl What North Korea needs is not an investment but massive infrastructure rebuilding top to bottom.  Then investment.
@MissMiaKang Very nice pic.  Health is the most important thing.
@SkyNews Dangerous.  What was she thinking??????????????????????????????
@BryanDruzin North and South Peninsula.  Both Koreans for thousands of years.
@tokyoreporter Meet on twitter??????????????? are you serious???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
@TheKoreaHerald What North Korea needs is South Korea cosmetic company.  Kim Jung Eun has to think and accept the reality.  North Korea cannot compete with rest of the world.  Let South Korea help you.
@KoreaExpose I think differently.  Here you go.
@JChengWSJ No nation has No Visa Policy.  Why cannot 5 Million Yeman refugees go to China or Japan.???? Why South Korea????  reason Jeju Island No Visa Policy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What do you think Jonathan Cheng????
@thehill I like " Boston B"  camouflage cap.  Looks really cool.   Boston B or New York cap.
@KoreaExpose I said.  A person holding on the signboard.  Not the speaker.  Two different things.
@MissMiaKang Mostly Jealous.  Narrow Mind,  Religious Conservative ( Which I really hate),  Two-face people,  Acting innocent online,  Person acting like God or Angel ( Fake person),  Person simply does not love themselves,  Simply losers.
@MissMiaKang Mia, if a male person does not his hands on your thigh.  That person must be really Homosexual.  Please be careful there are " Bi-Sexual" men out there.  Just be safe and date straight headed men.
@TimothyS Fried Pork Strip.  That's real Seoul with a cup of Soju.
@DrMarkPBarry When did NBC News has become North Korea expert????????????  We need to listen to Pompeo.
@davidvolodzko You cannot ban what you like.
@davidvolodzko 70 years outdated path catching up on North.
@YonhapNews Keep in mind.  They are not Koreans.
@KoreaExpose A person who is holding the signboard is not Korean rather South East Asian.  It makes a very big difference.  Don't you think???????????????????????
@chadocl NBC leak??? are you serious?????? I never trust NBC News.
@koreatimescokr Probably his half German.
@OlenaHeu Aloha.
@nypost Get real.  Like New York Post has become North Korea expert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@BuckTurgidson79 Drags heels???? Can they find the remains after 70 years in North Korea???? Common sense tells me.  I do not think so.

@QiZHAI Communism in Hollywood.
Japan Soccer Team SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Poland vs Japan 1-0 defeat.  Wasted time to go 16 Round.  Really cheap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@freekorea_us South Korea education system itself has many problems.  Fix South Korea education first and then maybe  North and South unification Education system.  South Korea should fix ( No Visa Policy in Jeju Island) first then thinking about Unification education. Going 2 be a big problem
@chadocl Honestly, way too early to say.  That's the truth.
@MissMiaKang Nice.  I would dare you to send sexy bootie pic.  Honestly, I would love it.
@JChengWSJ Smart idea because finally, President Trump knows now it isn't Kim Jung Un pulling the strings it is China Xi and Russia Putin.  It will only irritate and isolate Kim Jung Uneven though he isn't the one pulling the strings.
@oinkorea Good to hear.  Soccer can make two culture closer.
@MissMiaKang Smarter to come to Airport early.   Traffic, Baggage time, the problem can always arrive.
@AlastairGale Japan losing to Poland 1-0 whereas South Korea winning Germany 2-0 FIFA number 1 ranking team and former World Cup Champion.  Just say Japan was very lucky qualifying 16.  This is what it all means.  Not upsetting the referee as much as other teams are total BS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@EdwardHBOh Try Drugs or going to Canada.  It worked in Vietnam War era.
@Walter_Foreman Common sense:  Sex Toys department (  Camera, and Police).  Perfect place to catch criminals and perverts.  Come on.  We all know Korean angle here.
@NoonInKorea Common sense says,  it is China and Russia behind North Korea buffer zone policy and nuclearization.  President Trump should aim toward China and Russia.
@elisewho Fundamental Problem with South Korea Government.   No Visa Policy in Jeju Island invites unwanted guest like Chinese illegal criminals and Yemenis refugee.  Who is to blame for this current mess??? I would say South Korea No Visa Policy on Jeju Island. Lacking National Security!!
@KasulisK @mic In U.S.  Automobile, Bus, Taxi, Subway culture.   Americans do not need large train station because American population is spread out not condensed like Japan.  Keep in mind Japan land area is smaller than the State of California.
Keep in Mind:  No Asian Nation defeated #1 FIFA ranking Team Germany, Previous World Cup Champion 2-0.   South Korea was the first.  Truth Hurts.
@sportingnews @JChengWSJ Not as much South Korea eliminating Germany #1 FIFA ranking Team previous World Cup Champion 2-0.   No Asia Nation defeated or blanked Germany 2-0 keep that in mind in World Cup.
@allyjung @AFP Not who cares.South Korea defeated #1 FIFA ranking Team plus eliminated Previous World Cup Champion plus it German first round elimation happen twice in World Cup History 1939 and 2018 by South Koreans.Please get your facts correct more than just winning celebration. Has History.
@samkimasia Viva Corea!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Viva.
@SancadillaNorte Viva Corea!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@FIFAWorldCup @JChengWSJ Korean Engine started late.
@motokorich Beating 2-0 FIFA ranking #1 Team previous World Cup Champion.  Did Japan ever did it????? beaten FIFA number 1 Ranking team 2-0????? I do not think so.
@yunsukCNA Korean engine started late.  2-0 win over Germany.  Real KP ( Korea Pride).
@TheKoreaHerald If South Korea prepared for World Cup for next 4 years.  South Korea would have a better result like making it final 16 then going beyond final 4 like 2002 World Cup.  South Korea was ill-prepared like always.  2-0 win Germany was major high light.
@TheKoreaHerald Not watching it.  Going to sleep.  I already know the outcome.  South Korea Coach and Players are all bad and outdated.   lack of preparedness was costly.
@JChengWSJ You mean less than 1%, Korean men.  Not all.
@MailOnline His wiping out all old Kim ( family) followers.  He wants the new generation to lead North Korea.
@GIKorea South Korea Soccer can focus more on Round 16.   Hire Qualified Coach and pick real soccer players.  Enough with inconsistent crying wimps.  Only 2002 South Korea had a real team with a real coach ( Final Four) afterward all downhill from then on.
@MissMiaKang Go for it.
@tokyoreporter 21-year-old Tokyo University Student.   A great example of Japan.
@insight_co_kr Bad coffee.  Coffee tastes terrible.
@MailOnline Very useful in Sexual Intercourse.
@oinkorea No Visa ( South Korea Government) Policy = 5 Million Yemeni refugees.  Who is to blame???????????? I would say South Korea Government ( No Visa Policy) makes National Security very vulnerable.   All part of common sense South Korea Government seriously lacks.

@TheKoreaHerald Not Japanese pervert????!!!!!!!
@daveckang Very smart move from Kim Jung Un.  Very smart move.
@JChengWSJ The major reason I hate South Korea Soccer Teams and Korea Football Association.  Instead of picking qualified Coach and real " Soccer" players.  Wast time and energy on World Cup Myth calculation.  The reason why South Korea always fail except for 2002 World Cup they were real.
@tokyoreporter Online Business.  Cannot compete.
@MailOnline Sex is the oldest profession.  Tooth monument proves it.
@TheKoreaHerald Car drivers, bus drivers, Airplane pilots,  all the same.

@JamesTurnbull People who applauded ( School kids) in Korean we call them "날날이"  Juevinile Delinquent Kids. You find them plenty in Night clubs, Adult Entertainment areas in South Korea.  You will find them in Busan too plenty 10 year old with acting like pimps in underage girls whorehouse
@Newsweek Her previous two Rockers ( Ex) really mentally messed her up.  Hope she gets well mentally.

@JChengWSJ Rest in Peace.  He was very big part of 70 years South Korea Government and Politics.
@Min_Joo_Kim_ Qualify 16 round first.  After 2002 World Cup.  South Korea soccer hasn't improved or all down hill.  Hosting with North Korea World Cup 2030.   Drink coffee and please wake up.
@TheKoreaHerald When will South Korea pick real soccer players?  Sick and tired of inconsistent Korean flower boys soccer team.   Coach and players Suck.
@GIKorea 이것 모야!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@trilavier @JapanLite Japan " Island" geography shapes Japanese mind.   Tsunami and Earthquakes.  Afterward when Japanese cleans up the stadium.  Do you know what happens to World Cup stadium like Rio Stadium??? In White people living wearing shoes inside home.  Japanese look very clean.
@dongamedia 미친놈들.   한국인 축구 선수, 한국인 축구 감독 끝났다.   마지막 결과는 3패.
@nypost That mother is a Pimp.
@insight_co_kr When will South Korea soccer team pick real soccer players?  Not entertainers or flower boys.  Fundamentally two different things in Soccer World.
@MissMiaKang Man will show his manhood with how he talks to a woman.  Not how he treats.  Basic fundamental many woman lack understanding about man.
@hankookilbo 솔직히 손흥민 싫다.   선수가 중심히 업고,  선수가 국가 대표으로서 열심히 해야한다 정신이 없다.  그냥 실패하면 울다 영소하라 사고방식.   그것은 국가 대표 선수가 아니다.
@LynnKawano crazy.  An attacker on drugs.???
@YonhapNews World Class " Inconsistent" Player Son Hong Min.   Always to fail to score a goal for National Team.  He was picked to play for South Korea World Cup team.  What can it go wrong!!!!!!!!!!! My God.   Korea Football Association get your head together.
@hankookilbo 또 친찬 이냐?????? 그래서 대한민국 축구 발전이 없이!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 축구 는 결과 이다!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@insight_co_kr Final conclusion 2-1 loss.  End result what it all counts in football.
@AlastairGale Korea Football Association is too corrupt to pick a qualified coach and soccer players to lead the team.  When will South Korea pick real soccer players, not flower boys  Sick and tired Son Hong Min inconsistent playing and crying like an overgrown baby
The reason why South Korea soccer team does really bad in World Cup ( except for 2002) because Korea Football Association does not pick a qualified coach and soccer players to lead the team. KFA is too corrupt.  All players are flower boys, not real soccer players.  Play KT times
@TheJihyeLee @FIFAWorldCup South Korea played terribly for past 90 minutes.  I always knew what to expect waste time, waste critical shots,  in the end losing to Mexico.  This year South Korea Coach and Players all had wrong chemistry to lead World Cup.  Bad choice!!!!!!!
@insight_co_kr 90 minute of the game.  Game was lousy. South Korea waste time.   We all known before hand what to expect.  It is time Korean Media need to be very critical and honest about  Korea Football Association.   Simply No Improvement in South Korea Soccer for past 70 years. Still SUCKS!
@insight_co_kr Very inconsistent player.  This year South Korea soccer picked wrong players.  Unqualified team to play World Cup.  Coach, Players, KFA ( Korea Football Association) unqualified members to lead the team.  Consequence 3 loss.  South Korea going back to old time soccer World Cup. !
@GIKorea No Nation.  Has this fucked up policy!!!!!!!!!!! No Visa.   What happened to National Security.

@MissMiaKang 3 inches 6 feet deep.  Love Box.
@allyjung A better system is needed.  For example,  underage child prostitution.  Arrest the Pimp.  Put the pimp behind bars for 50 years.  Why does the whole people or family need to suffer because of few rotten apples?
@DailyMail Flight to Mexico.  Watching free porn.  Is that flight movie??? Porno????
Is South Korea President Moon being smart in " Korea National Security"?????? What do you think?
@samkimasia Chinese isn't happy because Samsung or LG isn't "화교" company like South East Asia Company.

@stonecold2050 I thought she was a better person.  Korean Proverb:  Look at the woman skin deep.
@JChengWSJ I never trusted and believe this coach.  Coach makes a Team win.
@TheKoreaHerald Same old shit.  Except for 2002 World Cup.  I stop watching South Korea soccer.   South Korea final four World Cup.  It will never happen again in my lifetime.  Korea Football Association has Fundamental serious problems.  Need Fundamental serious fixing.  KFA pulling down soccer
@your_moonchild @JAYBUMAOM You mean " Chicken Head"  style.   South Korea made themselves Kentucky Fried Chicken.
@eunapark Wasting time they scored the goal.  World Cup has never been a passive sport.  Mexico-South Korea match going to be far worse.  It is going to be " Cardio Survival Fitness" game.  Referees are paid underneath.  Soccer is a power of control.
@insight_co_kr 그 병신대문내 1-0 패배.
@insight_co_kr 감독, 선수, 대한축구협회 ( World Cup 준비가 없어).  대한민국 World Cup 역사 는 ( You always had one or three South Korean players screw up the game like today) 이것은 대한민국 축구애 정신이다.한국인 감독축구 보는 시각이 없어.  축구 상식, 시각, 인지가 잛어. 그리고 기본 준비가 없어
@YonhapNews Time and money wasted.  Fundamentally Korea Football Association always had problems.  Too lazy to fix.
저는 대한민국 ( World Cup) 축구 역사애 ( Hiddink 2002년) 배눌고 한국인 뛰는 축구선수 가 불수없다.
@insight_co_kr South Korea lost:  Coach, Players, Fouls, Unprepared,  Low self-esteem,  Take a look at numbers of the foul.  It was a foul that gave a penalty kick.  How South Korea lost.  How stupid can you really get.  Unprepared to Win the battle of War.
@TheKoreaHerald I never had high expectation.  Coach Sucked,  Players Sucked,  Look at foul numbers it says it all.  South Korea made foul.  Gave Penalty kick.  How game ended.  How stupid.  If you go to War unprepared to Win!! South Korea soccer World Cup self repeating History.  Never prepared
@BBCLBicker I never trusted and liked South Korea coach.  Players follow the coach.  So many inconsistent, low self-esteem,  unprofessional players in South Korea team.  I really do not care about what Pro-Team they had experienced.  The national level they all SUCK. Foul numbers says it all
@nydia_han Nice picture.
@chadocl Simple:  Rape, Hidden Camera,  Prostitution,  Bar Girls,  all part of North Korea Death camp.
@freekorea_us Do not be surprised if North Koreans take passage to the United States that now waned by South Korea.
@GTDRP @annafifield North Korea is protected by Mountains.  Pyongyang has lots of flatlands.  Only Megacity ( City size) doe does not have Mountains like Seoul.
@BBCWorld Osaka turned into water.  What happened???? Tsunami????????????????????
@long_legliteskn New pussy or not.  I love pussy.
@guentheralex @nktpnd What changed?  Trump-Kim Summit.  My expectation was not High or Low. Both leaders Trump and Kim wanted Middle Ground expectation.  Smart and Fair enough.
@sportalkorea 현재 골문을= 0
@nydia_han @6abc Another day in USA.
@TheKoreaHerald It already happened 7 years ago.  Nothing new.
@duyeonkim @BBCLBicker @BBCWorld President Trump means modify.   Do you think Kim Jung Un can understand what modify means.  Cancel is just simple and direct for him to understand.  North Korea isn't U.S. Ally to understand it anyway.
@TheKoreaHerald Yup, that will do it.
@YonhapNews Marriage and Education cost.  It is South Korea Economic System that makes Korean family debt.
@JChengWSJ @DubstepInDPRK North Korea cultural heritage is Korguryo-Balhae Policy.
CNN Travel says there is Japan ( Website) " Tattoo friendly Onsen"The Japanese word for Sauna/ Bath House.  Common sense tells those websites are own by Japanese Yakuza.  Be aware.
@JChengWSJ @andreilankov North Korea ( Kim Jung Un) probably never surrender because it was all long Russian made Missile.  Reality is like always China and Russia never knew what time period North Korea is in like President Trump that's a fundamental difference.
@WebMD Choose anti peroxide.  Keep your wound clean.  Let the weather dry it out.  Ocean salt water helps.
@MissMiaKang Mia,  woman, and man are same.  We all need to have good sex.  Release the hormone.  The gym is not enough.  Please, whatever you do use a condom.
@ColinZwirko @chadocl The problem here is only Government chosen people inside Pyongyang can watch it. Rest of North Korea citizens cannot watch it.  The fundamental reason why I do not trust or believe North Korea media.  It is all bullshit but Capitalism/ Black Market/ Hard currency trade is happens
@Newsweek No Nose means No Penis.
@JChengWSJ What is KCNA:  Keep Crap National Archive.  Past 70 years majority of Koreans learn to keep the crap out of Korea.
@willripleyCNN Reality:  North Korea already turning into Capitalism.   Just China, Russia, Syria, Iran, do not want North Korea to be a buffer zone.  CNN should always keep in mind.  North Korea does not have " News" media.   North Korea has no choice to go Capitalism.
@LynnKawano Lava trace miles away.
@freekorea_us Meaning ( North Korea) connection with Assad/Syria and Iran.  That is about it.  I seriously think Kim Jung Un is pulling out of Middle East.   It will not help Future of North Korea.
@MissMiaKang Not a boy.  It is called a " Pimp".   Very big difference between the two.
@oinkorea Only difference.  Trump and KIM, not a movie.
@EdwardHBOh Kim Jung Un signed the contract with President Trump.   The world saw it.  Kim Jung Un is in perfect scenario getting himself killed.
@allyjung Do not be surprised if Japanese Porno Company planted them in Korea like cherry blossom tree.
@DailyMail Ape Man.

@tokyoreporter Flying Bullet hit a human.
@insight_co_kr He will learn the Korean language really fast.
@tokyoreporter AKB48 are you serious??? do University students in Japan still watch them????? Bunch of losers.!!!!!
@freekorea_us Keep in mind:  There are many North Korea defectors that are spies.  There are many North Korea defectors do not want Korean Unification like to Keep North Korea as it is like how Southern Americans want to preserve and keep " Confederate Flag".
@KasulisK Every nation has had " Glory" days.  I really think the majority of White Americans messed it.  My favorite was late 1970's those were America Glory Hole days.
@SungYoonLee1 North Korea is Mafia State.  Not Yakuza. Yakuza is in Japan.
@MissMiaKang Vaseline is the best way for Mia.  Do not use the plastic toy.
@tokyoreporter Typical Japanese Pervert at work.  He also probably planted his Cherry Tree plant in South Korea too.
@TheJihyeLee Poetry kills people.
@samkimasia @realDonaldTrump @yoolimleenews @chosonexchange Army of Business men.
@Dest_Pyongyang @chadocl @TheEconomist Summit has no Win or Lose.  You need to think in the very big picture. President Trump signed a Business contract to legally attack North Korea if Kim Jung Un does pursue his business bargain ( President Trump Won). If anything goes wrong President Trump can now show contract.
@freekorea_us Reality majority of Koreans think President Trump did very well. The reason is expectation wasn't High or Low.  It was the middle expectation.
@DailyMail Love Gun.  ( Perfect location).
@GeographyNow Tough but I wish South Korea team well.
@BBCSteveR @annafifield Communist World sticks together.  So talking about Human Right Issue.  What did North Korea learn from China and Russia on Human Right Issues for past 70 years? If both nations have terrible Human Rights track records?  Probably nothing.
@MailOnline Paved the Dog.
@DailyMail Sex Offender looks like a Box.  No Nose means No Penis.
@JChengWSJ Money Issue.
@ianbremmer Is it FIFA arcade game????? I wish and hope.  This year many Korean think and hope not high.  Group together in Power House teams.
@MailOnline Fucking Robbie.
@MissMiaKang Love Box.
@MissMiaKang Nice Front Kick sweetie.
@annafifield Singapore Marina Hotel was constructed by South Korea company.  I hope and wish Kim Jung Un know the reality.
@martyn_williams Showing respect.
@TheKoreaHerald South Korea not being prepared.  No big news.
@james_acton32 @JChengWSJ Small Fat guy
@MissMiaKang You're just too hot.  Final conclusion.
@annafifield They no longer can play " Brain Washing" game.  Brain Washing has limitation.  President Trump and Kim Summit show it all.
@willripleyCNN President Trump knows when to be " Level Headed".   Trust and Respect do not cause enemy.
@nktpnd Respect.  President Trump is Businessman.  He knows when to be Level Headed.
@willripleyCNN He seriously needs to change North Korea system.  All-time very big Homework.
@chadocl Do you think " suspending" is the correct word?   I would say more like Time will Tell delay.
@MailOnline Paved the dog. Disgusting.
@sunjun_kim @agathe_lhomme Sick and tired of seeing Seoul Mayor.  That idiot looking, Charlie Brown, has no future for Seoul.
@mpsbell @AndreaRBerger @JNilssonWright @Sokeel @nktpnd I wasn't shouting.  Just making " Capital Letter"  point.  So many War Mongers wanted to invade North Korea or kill Kim Jung Un to make themselves look like Hero.  Single strike or War cost Millions of lives.  Trust and Respect do not cause enemy.
@SBS8news 홍 병신!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@mpsbell @AndreaRBerger @JNilssonWright @Sokeel @nktpnd BOTH LEADERS DID NOT WANT HIGH OR LOW EXPECTATION.  BOTH LEADERS WANTED " MIDDLE EXPECTATION"  FIRST TIME NORTH AND US. PRESIDENT MET FOR PAST 70 YEARS.  IT WAS VERY BIG ACCOMPLISHMENT.  TRUST AND RESPECT DOES NOT MAKE ENEMY'S.  KEEP THAT IN MIND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@TIME YOU NEED GOOD ROLE MODEL NATION TO TALK ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS.  NORTH KOREA ALLIES ( CHINA AND RUSSIA) BOTH HAD TERRIBLE DISGUSTING HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES.  PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS SMART to STAY AWAY AND DISCUSS MUCH MORE SERIOUS ISSUES.  THIS IS WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP MEANT.
@NoonInKorea Blue Peninsula.
@MarcoMilani05 @mpsbell Another 4 years of this Idiot looking Charlie Brown Seoul Mayor.
@tokyoreporter Online Forest Killer.  So typical in Japan.
@chadocl It wasn't a High or Low expectation.   Kim and Trump wanted Middle expectation.  Both won equally that is what both leaders wanted.
@KingstonAReif North Korea Nuclear Missile reaching U.S. Mainland is always has been " Hollywood Movie".   Reality it always has been Pro-Isreal Lobby in the State of Texas ( Pro Judeo-Christian) lobbying to stop North Korea Nuclear Missile reaching Iran, Syria. A direct threat to Isreal not US
@martfack The reason why " War" is a terrible idea.
@willripleyCNN People inside North Korea cannot ask why.  Plus it hurts pride but North Korea denuclearization has happened within 2 months ago.  Average people inside North Korea do not care.  All up to Kim Jung Un!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@CBSNews Police doing his job.   If you disrespect Police officer by raising your voice or getting close with a video camera.  Common sense it can irritate Police officer use force or raise his voice.  All about Law and Order.   Just prove your innocents and walk away. Blacks stupid too!
@johnsifton You can only discuss ( Human Right Issues) if Nation had a good role model.  Meaning North Korea political and economic allies(  Russia and China) all had terrible Human Right records.  President Trump was very smart not to waste time on it.  Talk bigger important issues with KJU
@wikitree Smart choice.  She is moving on.
@PHancocksCNN @willripleyCNN Will Ripley twitter has been very quiet.  Good to see him again.
@JChengWSJ Kim Jung, Unlike Roller Coaster ride.  He better put a seat belt.   A lot of changes are going to happen inside North Korea.  Forget China or Russia.   Pyongyang aka Flat land is going to change.  Do not be surprised if North Korea is coming out of rat hole quick and fast.
@TheJihyeLee Communication plus English is International Language.  Sends a stronger message to China, North Korea, and Russia.   Like it or not.  The English language itself has a more direct understanding then Korean or Japanese.
@KasulisK A thousand miles away from North Korea,  in front of President Trump.  Charm can be a very smart thing.
@MissMiaKang Yeah,  beware of " Innocent/ Virgin" type of guys.  All want to act like Angel or God Moral but underneath they all want to get under your pants.  Guys know that is total bullshit based approaching woman.  Guys need to be real.
@jljzen President Trump gave the trust to Kim Jung Un.   Now it is all up to Kim Jung Un seriously DeNuke.  Get North Korea rolling.  Even though it is hard or takes years.  That is the final destiny of Kim Jung Un.   This is what President Trump is saying directly or Indirectly. Serious
@CeFaanKim @ABC7NY Spock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Planet Mars Professor.
@TheJihyeLee @JChengWSJ @dennisrodman Dennis Rodman,  good to see you.  Brother.
@JacobBogle @BuckTurgidson79 Kim Jung Un probably got the very big hint.   His lifestyle will get him killed.  He seriously needs rapid change ( forward).   North Korea does not blend well with 21st century pace.  I think Kim Jung Un got the clue.
@BuckTurgidson79 I never trusted Russian or Chinese ( Communist World).   I really do not know why???? You tell me.
@rpcward89 Red Party ( Fucked themselves badly) this is what it all means.  Plus Ex President Park did not help a bit.
@willripleyCNN 1) Denuke ( Process) has begun 2 Month ago.  2) North Korea people do not really care about Nuke or Denuke.  Kim Jung Un has to do.  Not the people.  3) North Korea people do not watch News.  They watch South Korea TV shows legally or Illegally.  4) Directly/ Indirectly NK is say
@TheKoreaHerald His outdated.
@Robert_E_Kelly Like Canada and UK do not right?!
@realDonaldTrump Love and Peace.
@KasulisK President Trump showed two reality.
@chadocl Not exactly sure what you mean but the expectation wasn't High or Low.  It was in middle expectation for both leaders.  Both leaders won equally.
@NRO @pwrhungry Have you heard NightVision?  You cannot hide.  Kim Jung Un learned 101 CIA lesson in Singapore.  You cannot hide.  No Ninja Weaponised Electricity. You just cannot hide.  Kim knows it very well now.
@annafifield About time.  Kim is thinking.
@annafifield President Trump gave us a very big hint.  What might be brighter future for North Korea.  It is a chess game.  Now it is all up to Kim Jung Un make his future brighter.  President Trump gave 101 business lesson for 90 minutes with Kim. If Kim is smart he will take the right path.
@NarangVipin I never watched Karate Kid remake. A new era for North and USA.  Do not be surprised if North Korea comes out of Rat Hole.
@rpcward89 Past.  A new era has begun for North and USA.
@willripleyCNN Will Ripley,  downplay denuclearization because it is all gone.  Smart not even bring it up in North Korea media.   Can people ask why??? in North Korea?????? all part of common sense.
@MissMiaKang Does he have erection???? Be careful.
@willripleyCNN Thank You.  Mr. President.
@koreanforeigner President Trump short documentary that Kim Jung Un saw was called " Real Estate Economy Uche".   Direction and Path President Trump and Western World want North Korea to lead.
@elisewho You cannot really blame him.  All consequence getting close to China for past 70 years.
@andreilankov Again I disagree.
@JChengWSJ @WarIntelNEWS Reality:  Who is holding " Death Grip" is President Trump.  Here " completely out-negotiated" does not play out.  Reason is expectation wasn't High or Low but Kim-Trump both wanted in the Middle expectation.
@JuddLegum President Trump will have along sleep in Air Force 1
@Independent Believe it or not.  The answer is Yes.
@TheKoreaHerald No such thing as NK expert.  99.9 percent of the time all fundamentally wrong.  If they were right.  Korean Unification would have happened along time ago.
@BuckTurgidson79 North Korea ( No such thing as News).   If Kim-Trump Summit is seen by North Korea people  riot will happen.  Common sense.  70 years isolated state knows better .  Just wait for slow rapid change coming soon.
@DrMarkPBarry Angle came from Kim Jung Un/ North Korea.   North Korea wanted it for past 70 years.
@CatKillough She is living Bible.
@BuckTurgidson79 Hope and wish.  Smell coffee and wake up.   North Korea is 70 years behind.  Develope economy.   President Trump gave a very big hint to Kim Jung Un.   Make real estate economy to develop North Korea!!!! Big or Small all up to Kim Jung Un/ North Korea. Kim Jung Un better wake up!
@KasulisK Meaning " Twilight Zone".
@RealMuckmaker Thank You.
@motokorich Meaning:  Stop making and shooting missiles.  Stop threating neighbor allies with a Nuclear weapon.
@allyjung No High expectation or No Low expectation.   Keep it a Middle expectation.   Past 70 years enemy state meeting with the U.S. President.  You want to talk about Human Right Issues even China and Russia has poor record.   Kim Jung Un never had a good role model to learn Human Right
@motokorich Military exercises can happen without North Korea knowing.   In Hawaii, Thailand, Okinawa,  Australia,  Pacific Ocean.   Plus nowadays it is all computerized military exercises.
@willripleyCNN Kim Jung Un/ North Korea ( seriously need to act smarter than before) meaning stop making the same mistake over and over again.   Keep the promise and move on to a better life.  President Trump and South Korea only want to help North Korea to get better.  Sooner it is better KJU!
@samkimasia @business You need to say it.
@willripleyCNN Kinda surprise twitter was calm.
@annafifield Time has changed in North Korea.  This is what it all means.  Simply it is no joke for North Korea.  70 years of self-isolation got them nowhere.  I think it is now they are waking up.  Crossing my fingures and hope for the best.  Thousand miles to Singapore ( Common sense).
@freekorea_us Keep in mind:  Stealing is a crime in South Korea, USA, rest of the world.  Just North takes much stronger stance.   Coma is wrong.  You need a report with straight facts.
@aidnmclaughlin Your my Brother.
@samkimasia @realDonaldTrump A misunderstanding causes a temper to stir.   Korean Journalist and Korean News Media should always fundamentally understand.
@eosnos @BarbaraDemick About time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 70 years of China and Russia buffer zone.  Kim Jung Un please smell Americano coffee and wake up.  North Korea and Kim Jung Un future seriously need it.
@annafifield South Korea, USA always there if North open there mind wider.
@KasulisK Be aware and Keep the n mind.  There are many North Korea defectors that want to keep old regime alive.  Funny but it is the truth.  How Southern part of America wants to keep and preserve " Confederate Flag".
@freekorea_us @DrTaraO You are getting information in wrong source.  Be mentally aware there are Pro-North Korea newspaper in South Korea and USA. There are current day North Korea people wanting to cling to old Kim Family regime like current day North Korea. That will change soon.  KJU smelling coffee
@willripleyCNN So true.  I agree.  But Kim Jung Un did not make himself easier for outside world to trust him.  I only wish this time.  Kim Jung Un smells Americano Coffee ( President Trump leadership) wake up and move forward toward and fast economic development.  It is about time for North.!!
@willripleyCNN It's real.  All in.  I wish only for the best.
@chadocl It's real.  I wish only for the best between North and USA.
@motokorich Nice.
@BuckTurgidson79 Keep in mind.  Singapore Marina Hotel was built by South Korea construction company.
@chadocl Denuclearization has begun.  Kim Jung Un made thousand miles trip for nothing.
@themichellewie @omegawatches Love Box.
@willripleyCNN Lucky we have Def Sec Mattis.
@Newsweek Nobody is beating.  Both need each other.  Including South Korea.  Final conclusion this is what it all means.
@themichellewie Nice shot.  Posture is strong.
@rpcward89 Much better than Current Seoul Mayor Charlie Brown.
@sarahblakemedia Does Kim Jung Un have any idea that hotel was constructed by South Korea company!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@annafifield Please tell Kim Jung Un Marina Bay Hotel was built by South Korea construction company.  If everything goes well it will be within 5 or 10 years South Korea company can transform North Korea like Israel or Singapore.  Just matter of time.
@W7VOA Nice Picture.  I wish North Korea going forward.  Be next Israel ( North East Asia).  If North Korea Kim Jung Un and people put there head straight.  They can do it.
@willripleyCNN @camanpour Now we finally see your news.  Good to see you Will.
@Phae_bae_is_bae @BTS_twt Taste good.   The idea probably came from Hawaii.  Produce in Hawaii and California.
@TheKoreaHerald Finding the " Middle Ground".   Not having a High or Low expectation.
@JChengWSJ Do not be surprised if the idea and Made in Hawaii.
@AndreaRBerger Security reason is #1,  No Nation put two leaders ( Kim Jung Un, Kim Jung Un sister) in same Airplane #2,   Kim Jung Un airplane route avoided ( U.S.  Pacific route) instead took China/ South East Asia route #3.   Singapore/Isreal/ Mossad connection #4.  Playing smart #5
@EdwardHBOh Kim Jung Un went to Singapore to defeat President Trump????? very stupid hindsight.  Typical " Narrow Hindsight"  Journalism.   I clearly see Kim Jung Un not playing.  Some serious shit is going down in Singapore.  Both sides are serious.
@JChengWSJ Is it the weather?????????????
@chadocl Very few Yellow Cabs.  You will find plenty in Tokyo.
@JamesTurnbull Sexual violence.  1980's Pimps.
@TheKoreaHerald South Korea ( not surprising).   Lack of awareness is South Korea fundamental problem.
@tictoc Very Narrow Hindsight like saying the cost of Korean Unification will pull back South Korea/ Korean future development.
@charles_finny @annafifield My analysis 50-50.
@TheKoreaHerald Neck stabber.
@elisewho @BBCLBicker Kim Jung Un ( Getting smart).
@daveckang @Robert_E_Kelly Security reason.  Common Sense:  No Nation flys two leaders in one airplane.  Meaning Kim Jung Un,  Kim Jung Un ( sister).Plus take a look flight route ( stayed close to China/ South East China route) instead of Pacific ( USA International Route).  Keep in mind Singapore /Isreal
@JChengWSJ Kimchi Ice Cream is very tasty.
@YonhapNews Idiots it is called " National Security Purpose" no nation put two leaders into one airplane!!!!!!!!!!! Plus Singapore having close ties with Isreal.  Assad Syria wanting to visit North Korea on the line.  Use your Fcking Common sense!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@BuckTurgidson79 @NoonInKorea I hope so.
@tokyoreporter Japan has highest percentage HTLV-1 ( HIV/ AIDS cousin genes) 10% of the Japanese population is infected by it.  That guy clearly shows it.
@JChengWSJ You can find it in Hawaii and California too.  Taste great.
@JChengWSJ I have my doubts.
@JChengWSJ @rpcward89 Call it ( Security) reason.  Plus North Korea knows Singapore has close ties with Israel.
@chadocl No Nation sends two leaders in one aircraft.  Security reason.  Plus North Korea knows Singapore has close ties with Isreal.  The common sense of National Security.
@thehill TSA search needs one serious common sense.  If passengers do not have criminal record let them pass freely.
@Robert_E_Kelly I cannot say it is a bad idea.  First time in 50 years Kim member in the family made the first visit outside of North Korea.  It means something.   Not having high expectations or low expectation.  The best answer is to look for a middle solution.  This is what Trump and Kim want
@allyjung In Dark Web sites.  Mostly 99.9 percent are Japanese made.  If Japanese planted them like Cherry Trees in Korean Peninsula.  I would not be surprised.
@chadocl Safety reason.
@JChengWSJ @deweysim China Airline takes off Singapore or Kim Jung Un timetable??? Do not be surprised if the extra date is added.
@TheKoreaHerald President Trump " God Bless You".

Be Aware:  Japan has the highest percentage per population more than 10% are infected with HTLV-1 Virus.  HIV AIDS ancestors.  Nobody talks about.  Other nations have high percentage HTLV-1 Virus ( Taiwan, Iran, Australia).
@oinkorea Just shows how South Korea Government officials who work in Airport and in Journalism are just plain stupid.
@koreatimescokr Yubin you made a very smart choice.  There is life beyond Wonder Girls.
@oinkorea WTF are you saying??? Ilsan is in South Korea.   Common sense tells me holding on South Korea flag represents you are Democratic/ Capitalist Person!!!!!!!!!!!!!

@willripleyCNN Officially ending Korean War, a Diplomatic relationship between the USA and North Korea,  Build Economic and Political trust between two nation will only help the world.  Not harm the world.

@EdwardHBOh @BuckTurgidson79 I wish you well.
@MayorHarryKim Power of Nature.
@stonecold2050 I disagree.
@EdwardHBOh Diplomacy.
@chadocl Hope and wish smarter people who want to modernize North Korea economically and politically.   No more military parade, No more dance, No more Missiles.   Let's all make " Money".
@Robert_E_Kelly @nybooks John Bolton will only cause the eyebrow stir.  All about diplomacy not being weird.

@hankyungmedia Do not censor sex.  Only Nipples.  Who cares.
@junghpak1 @BuckTurgidson79 Can North Korea the afford it??? Going back to Missile threat????  I seriously think North Korea watchers do not really know how serious North Korea is in right now.  North Korea collapse or USA killing off Kim Jung Un/ Meaning WW.III.   The world needs serious factual reporting.
@willripleyCNN North Korea needs Burger King and Starbucks.
@JChengWSJ The U.S. Military base in South Korea will stay for a very long time even after Korean Unification.
@MailOnline In North Korea, it is " Coma".
@VictorDCha South Korea needs to move fast.  The problem has been for past 60 years South Korea has not move fast to make peace with North Korea.  If War ever to happen it will be WW.III not next Korean War.  Making Peace is an obligation for South Korea fast or not.  Only solution.
@nypost Peter North is one of them.
@koreanforeigner Seoul Mayor ( Probably fits that stereotype).
@chadocl Smart.  Not to have John Bolton.
@nydia_han @aliciavitarelli @6abcadamjoseph @duciswild @SesamePlace @C2CPhiladelphia @RedCross Nice.
@LynnKawano @USGSVolcanoes Huge Hole.
@willripleyCNN North Korea seriously need to move away from China and Russia.  Past 70 years no improvement for North Korea ( citizens 25-30 Million of them).
@MissMiaKang Mia, now you are thinking.  Please use a condom.
@annafifield @washingtonpost Meaning of U.S. Allie now has no meaning.  Just America First.
@OliveTV Jason Limpeh Ng 야비한 중국인.  한국인 민족 차별하면서 대한민국 방송애 나운다?! 대한국민 으로서 반대합니다.  Singapore 음식 유리사 도 안니고.  양아지 건달 놈이 한국인 척 하면서 Youtube ( 대한민국 옥 하면서).  중국인 건달 양아치 증말 성격 뜨럽고, 야비한 중국 놈!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@chadocl North Korea ( Life Line) serious.  It is time North Korea ( Kim Jung Un) have serious peaceful diplomatic relations with the United States.   Kim Jung Un seriously do not know who is a real enemy who screwed North Korea for past 70 years.  It is China and Russia.
@allyjung @AFP It is called brainwashed plus unlike South Korea.  North Korea never changes staff members in Government.  So not surprised.
@Robert_E_Kelly 50-50 cheezy.
@YonhapNews Girls need to wear Mini-Skirt weather is going to be hot and humid.
@BuckTurgidson79 Like, go drink West Sea Piss water. LMAO.
@chadocl Perfect " Pink Floyd" album cover.
@chadocl Yes,  Kim Jung Un needs guidance from South Korea and USA.  Not behave and think stupid.  Past leaders in the Middle East were thought and act stupid.  The only thing that saves Kim Jung Un he might be crazy but not stupid.
@Robert_E_Kelly I would like to warn the experts.  Avoidance and Ignorance will make North Korea take 15 years.  More North Korea leader interact with outside World he will realize.  The path his taking will become a total disaster.
On Youtube:  Controversial Video:  ID name:  Singapore in Korea: Do you think Koreans are racist?! :  Hypocrite Singaporean goes crazy racist rampage toward Koreans.   Racist Singaporean in Korea.!!!!!!!!!!! Crazy son of the bitch.
@annafifield China " Illegal" activity starts from China Town World Wide.  Drugs, Sex, Tax invasion,  here you go the fundamental rule of Chinese break.  Yes, in Japan, USA, Europe,  except for Korea and Russia.  Overseas Chinese were kicked out.
@LynnKawano My God.  Power of Nature.
@chadocl The reality that needs South Korea help.  This is what it all means.
@JChengWSJ All Koreans are against Libya, Iraq,  John Bolton, VP Mike Pence,  policy on North Korea.  Let's report and provide fair-minded reporting.  Sick and tired of bias report on North Korea.
@EdwardHBOh 70 years ( Self Isolated) state.  Can you honestly want rapid change or have Libya/ Iraq plan???.   You need to set a realistic goal.   A quick change to North Korea is very unrealistic.  Even South Korea/ Koreans needed 100 years to change if you include 36 years plus 70 years.
@freekorea_us Like Yankee and Rebels have different beliefs on freeing slaves. Differences between North and South will exist but the outcome will be much better for both.
@YonhapNews If North Korea leader ( Kim Jung Un)  people of North Korea think straight.  North Korea will have very very big potential.  President Trump is correct.
@chadocl Screw Chongryon News Agency.   All bunch South Koreans mind trap in Japan ( North Korea School System) not knowing who they are people.  I have never trusted or believed those groups of people.  Bunch Superficial groups of people.
@freekorea_us Same Shit depends on Four Nations ( China, Russia, USA, Korean Peninsula).  Unlike the Middle East and Europe.
@BuckTurgidson79 Will Ripley ( CNN).  Good to see him.  Now in Hong Kong.
@MissMiaKang Mia, that is great.  You should get nice 2 hour Thai Massage.  Like me today.
@chadocl Just as much CIA, Mossad, British Intelligence know about North Korea vice-versa Kim Jung Un/ North Korea knows about them equally.   Everything goes both ways like how the river flows.
@JohnDelury I'm surprised you made a comparison like un-Professor like.  First, there is no China and Russia as neighbors meaning North Korea is surrounded by two big communist nations.  Common sense.
@MailOnline Simply she backstabs Anne Frank and her Jewish family.   Just terrible.
@choonsikyoo urges constitutional revision to peace or war???????
@koreatimescokr This ball game in North and South.   The discussion is the only solution.
@BuckTurgidson79 of course.  Mike Pence, John Bolton mouthing off on Libya toward North Korea.  That ticked off Kim Jung Un.
@mariyamaguchi @hyungjin1972 @AP @kmorit Age of 100 years.  He clearly will have " Mixed" emotions on Japan!!!!!!
@rpcward89 The only threat is North Korea economic competition ( if they open and modernize).  Japan, China, Russia, USA, and Israel clearly knows the potential competition in Science, Technology, Business, and Trade.
@JohnDelury Did she ask right question???? That is the big question.
@rpcward89 Do not worry North East Asia and Russia are keenly aware.  Only people who are not aware is Jewish American Lobby,  State of Texas Christian Judeo-Christian conservatives,  John Bolton and Mike Pence.
@MissMiaKang Like a woman can find sperm smell miles away.
@MissMiaKang Mia, please do not become 40 years old Virgin.  You are too good to be.
@chadocl The big gap always existed.  Nothing new.  Even China and USA has a very big gap.  Also, Russia and USA have a very very big gap.  The gap between North Korea and USA we can handle it.  25 Million or roughly 40 Million ( Overseas) can handle no biggy.
@willripleyCNN Good question.  The reason why President Moon visited North Korea Kim Jung Un.  This is what South Koreans want to know too.
@OhMyGOFF Looks creepy.
@EdwardHBOh Pace and Speed between North and South is " Turbo" engine.
@allyjung Going Turbo.
@chadocl 2.0 front page
@CobraBall3 @AncientSubHunt Reason War should never happen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! John Bolton should see this picture thousand times.  John Bolton never served Military and John Bolton never fought in the major war for his country.  He sits in office to preach War over Diplomacy.
@themichellewie Hello, Sexy Queen.
@annafifield It was destiny.
@motokorich It simply had too.  Much better than War or Military Parade.
@rpcward89 Please fucking discuss and have peace!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@chadocl Discuss, Discuss, Discuss, much better than War or Military Parade.  Looks like next door neighbor.  Technically it is.  But Fuck.!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@JChengWSJ WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! walking into the neighbor Korean BBQ Party!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

@LynnKawano @USGSVolcanoes Looks like a massive bomb exploded.  I wish all Big Island residence well.   Oahu Island is blessed with the weather, geography, ocean, people, just everything.  I wish Hawaii well.  Aloha and Mahalo.
@annafifield @nyphil @SecDef19 This year around.  North Korea is in the much much tougher situation.  Clearly shows Money is power.  Not Missiles!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@MissMiaKang Plastic Cock Island.
@willripleyCNN Will, do not be surprised if you do a personal interview with Kim Jung Un next time.  Do not be surprised.
@trustrestored Like we never knew..................... Black screwing black.
@KasulisK @businessinsider the latest picture was taken in Seoul, Korea.  President Moon looked like he woke up in a very bad dream.
@SubinBKim Nobody wins in Political Science arena. That is what Korean War history says.......
@Newsweek Another day in America.
@ChuBailiang Smoking again????????????????? Kim Jung Un.
@thehill Total Bull Shit angle.
@BBCLBicker President Trump wants to cover all angles.  I think Kim Jung Un/ North Korea same.  What worries me is John Bolton.  If he makes another wisecrack.  Another delay.
@DrMarkPBarry Comparing North Korea with Libya or Iraq.
@VictorDCha Channel open for talk.  Do not be surprised if President Trump meets Kim Jung Un.
@JChengWSJ @ByChunHan Not over for President Trump.  Do not be surprised.
@KasulisK Yup. It might all go down.
@BBCLBicker I agree.
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington Nice cup.
@ABC Did he lose weight?????????????????????
@yunsukCNA Not inviting probably smarter idea because those areas are Nuclear effected for next 100 years.
@soulofseoulblog Orange color Taxi has to go.  It does not blend well with the city.
@News_Y 미행 도 범쥐다.   대한민국 경찰.   그리고 날날이 ( 남 과 여) 주회하라!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@willripleyCNN Are you in Hong Kong now????
@annafifield President Trump probably made a smarter choice. Like how during WW.II  Douglas MacArthur saved Japan falling apart by not dethroning Japanese Emperor into War Criminal status.North Korea regime possibly fall apart/ South Korea not being ready probably could have the main obstacle
@GIKorea In Busan.  Yes, that does happen.
@SkyNews @chesh Love and Peace.
@JChengWSJ More like delayed.
@chadocl @YonhapNews honestly, think South Korea and North Korea news media are weird.  The similar character between two both has Narrow Hind Sight journalist.  Plus South Korea does not have other news media outlet to get left, right, third, fourth, fifth political view.   lazy ass news!!!!
@politiCOHEN_ @willripleyCNN Shocked!!!!!!!!!!!!! No, they all wanted to sing and dance with Military Parade.  Off course they were SHOCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@alistaircoleman @JChengWSJ Shows North Korea had no high expectation toward President Trump,  John Bolton, and Mike Pence.
@TIME If you have John Bolton,  Mike Pence,  on your team.  It is good to delay or cancel.  Kim Jung Un wanted " North Korea Style" to solve this mess.  Not Libya, or Iraq.
@EastAsiaGroup @Reuters Chinese bombers fly around Taiwan????? are you serious????
@wikitree Are you surprise in South Korea. When was last time South Korea actually planned things......................
@motokorich You sure reaction will come quick????
@AndreaRBerger Andrea,  North Korea probably blew it up because of Nuclear Termination.  Those areas not effected for next 100 years.  Thanks to Kim Jung Un ( Classic World Class Idiot).
@AndreaRBerger Do not undermine if this letter " Angle" came from John Bolton.
@willripleyCNN Do not worry.  You are not in the Middle East.  Plus do not trust Chinese reporters like they surely help North Korea for past 70 years.
@rpcward89 At least Moon showed his Ass.
@AlexJensenNews Mike Pence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! President Donald Trump to rescue.  Final Conclusion.  No Peace!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@chosonexchange Kim Jung Un could have been much wiser.  Which state loses more common sense tells me North Korea.
@thehill Dr. Frankenstein.
@motokorich He never sleeps 24 hours.
@GlobalAsianista Kim Jung Un is so retarded.
@koreatimescokr The U.S. government is getting really really stupid.  They simply have no idea who is Allie or enemy.
@annafifield Kim Jung Un smart move.
@ABC He also attacked another guy.  Typical Psychopath at work.
@Ian56789 Do not go back to Russia sweetie.
@YonhapNews Kim Jung Un is afraid same goes all upper elites who supported old outdated Kim family regime for past 70 years.  If Kim Jung Un meets President Donald Trump all those old timers must flee to Russia or die.   True reality.
@JChengWSJ North Korea isn't Libya.  But John Bolton sure thinks so................
@MissMiaKang you look nice. sweetie.
@willripleyCNN Thank You.  Have a safe trip.

@BuckTurgidson79 Reality " Kim Jung Un" has no choice.   His 25 Million to 1.
@TheKoreaHerald Just hearing and partying to Van Halen?????
@MailOnline Instead of brainwashing them back to the civilized world.  They simply kill or execute them.  Worse than North Korea.
@jackiebensen Love Rain.

@annafifield I see one female companion.  Looks nice.
@willripleyCNN Will, your back in North.  South Journalist arrives.  Good.  Hope the outcome is nice.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Better not to rush.  Reality Kim Jung Un ( North Korea) is not ready.
@BuckTurgidson79 looks like a toy.
@jennargibson Only peaceful Korean Unification can happen.
@RLHeinrichs I realize China, Russia, Japan, USA ( Depending on Conservative, Radical, Liberal, War Mongers, Fascist) Americans do not want Korean Unification to happen.  Only people who do not know all of this is Koreans.
@willripleyCNN I see Chinese reporter sleeping already on the plane.
@TheKoreaHerald Reality burning movie sucks bad.  Steven Yeun better takes Hollywood. WE SUCKING SERIOUSLY NEED ANOTHER ZOMBIE MOVIE WITH STEVEN YEUN . DAWN OF THE DEAD REMAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ABOUT TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

@Robert_E_Kelly @voxdotcom Looks cool.
@chadocl True or not.  China, Russia, North Korea,  Money Hungry Media angle is working up again.  Anyway, I wish them all the best.  They sure need it.  I mean North Korea denuclearization.  It is seriously not a joke.
@diabetesdaily Isn't the actor???? Dead Pool 2?????
@chadocl Will you pay U.S. $10,000 Dollars for showcase????? Coming off from my personal pocket money???? I do not think so.
@BuckTurgidson79 @ISNJH @KBSWorldRadio Just say North Korea did not decline.  South Korea Journalist not going to pay US 10,000 Dollars for the showcase.
@YonhapNews Why do you give 10,000 U.S. Dollars for the complete showcase?
@oinkorea North Korea " Money Hungry" fuckers in the act.
@annafifield Penis the Measurement.   Erection size or Non-erection size????  Anyway, you cannot imagine it measuring in front of the courtroom.  Just say not the same in bed.

I am listening too " My Sweet Lord" by Geroge Harrison.  Such a fucking good song.  I love this song.
@annafifield @YKimNBCBoston My Honest opinion: Among All USA President.  President Trump trying his fucking best to solve fucking Korean Peninsula North Korea Problems.  It is about fucking time give fucking respect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@NoonInKorea Not really.  Vietnam simply has become a Communist state since Vietnam War.
@JChengWSJ BTS with Taylor Swift.  ^^

@LynnKawano I can feel the heat.
@LynnKawano Like Bomb exploded.
@DrMarkPBarry Lava is creeping up and spewing all over big island Hawaii.  It can happen to North Korea with Nuclear radiation leaking.
@thisthatamy Fair to say South Korea is one big mega city population of 56-60 Million people.
@motokorich Japanese Imperial family did DNA check or Japanese Imperial family permits archeological research Japanese Imperial family tomb your news report could have a completely different outcome.  Plus Koryo, Nara was called Kudara, Nara Japan capital city.  Kudara/Kansai hear and see.
@annafifield 50-50 Percent Sherlock.  North Korea isn't stupid with all this Libya Plan by John Bolton bullshit.
@NYTNational I see German Hitler is the U.S.A.
@PMCroninCNAS @chosonexchange Amb Sung Kim person needed indeed ASAP.

@business The company that needs drastic new ideas and direction.
@OhMyGOFF Love Green.
@motokorich We call it " Half Ass" show.
@BuckTurgidson79 Media always gets wrong toward North Korea.
@AlastairGale Reality Koreans did not welcome " Fascist Foreigners".  It Hirobumi ( Japanese Fascist leader who masterminded Korea) got shot and assassinated by Korean Nationalist Mr. Ahn.
@MissMiaKang liking the spice.
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington No father.  Is she last Jedi????
@koreanforeigner Kim Jung Un angle is really fucked up.  Final conclusion.  Did Moon Jae Inn know about this??????????????? was whole thing.  Mickey and Minnie Mouse parade??? WTF is happening.
@GIKorea What is she doing to save her second generation???
@MissMiaKang Mia,  spreading your cheek.  All fuck ups will follow.  End of story.
@YonhapNews Kim Jung Un is total fuck up.  Fuck you asshole.  Moon Jae Inn if you agree on this. Fuck you too.
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington @AnthonyMague @David_Culver @MeghansMirror @royalmusing @Broembach @hodakotb @givenchy I wish you both all the best.  I honestly think Prince Harry very strong person.  Personally and mentally.
@Newsweek lmao.
@JChengWSJ @annafifield @Min_Joo_Kim_ The Hawk but not Eagle.
@eosnos @VictorDCha Fair to say.  Kim Jung Un is confused.
@chloekimsnow You need to drink beer.  Beautiful day in Korea.  So hot and warm.
@LynnKawano The pool of Lava eating away big Island Hawaii.
@YonhapNews Going to return back to North Korea????? Say some crazy ass shit.  They have been deducted by South Korea Government!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@TIME Honestly.  I did watch.  Older brother royal marriage.  Not going to watch.  Harry and Meghan wedding.  Something isn't right.
@thehill Do you believe his Jewish lawyer????? His racist.
@nypost His a Jew.  Do you believe it????
@annafifield @AlastairGale @TomWrightAsia His eyes have changed.
@Daily_Express Marriage is all wrong.  Bride family has no respect.
@MissMiaKang Why do you use the uber driver?  Do you know how many rapists work as uber driver?????
@ChaseMit Reminds me of Israel.
@Newsweek lmao.
@Broembach @OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington Love Green.
@DrMarkPBarry North Korea itself is a lie.  No such thing is North Korea.  Majority of Koreans did not vote for North Korea to exist.  It is the superficial state with a superficial leader in the North.
@DrMarkPBarry Be careful what you wish for.  Majority of Koreans do not think and act like you do. Mr. Chung!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@agathe_lhomme We have to be careful what we wish for.  That is my self-opinion and final conclusion. Korean Proverb:  Once the words come out of your mouth you cannot pull it back in.  or Do not bite your own tongue.  Only you will bleed.
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington @Broembach @katemeas @David_Culver @AnthonyMague Love the Green.
@choonsikyoo @JChengWSJ Fuck Kim Jung Un.  Fat little idiot.
@STForeignDesk South Korea:  Koreans will not be watching it.
@MetroUK Stupidity at best.
@Robert_E_Kelly President Trump is mentally unstable.  John Bolton is a worse candidate.  CNN News report says  North Korea is trying to get John Bolton fired.  It is wise to say John Bolton Character, Policy, Personality will get himself fired.  Not North Korea!!!!!
@AskAKorean the hill article.  Korean GOAT.  So typical.
@GlobalAsianista I always get the impression they are all like North Korea brainwashed spies.  South Korea government should let them leave.  It is time we let North Koreans stand up bye there own feet.   Stop giving them money and media attention!!!! let them work for a living.
@Robert_E_Kelly Past 70 years a lot of shit came out from North Korea.  If North Korea does not say crazy ass slogans it is not North Korea.  We all have become immune to North Korea bye now.  At least in South Korea.
@JChengWSJ Fat vs Thin.  Who always wins?????? You tell me.
@insight_co_kr Expect for 2002.   South Korea World Cup ride is finished. Honest truth it is going to be 3 loss.  All goals first half.    South Korea teams are weak in " Cardio and Creative" soccer game plan.  100 percent Coach and Players fault.  Plus very weak goalkeeper makes matter worse.
@martyn_williams That is North Korea for past 70 years.  Do you honestly expect a drastic change like Kim Jung Un handpicked citizens singing and dancing to South Korea KPOP????? The process has been very slow for North Korea.  Like it or not.  Kim Jung Un knows he has to change. Not drastically.
@nypost Canada Poop woman.   We see it everytime in Canada.  At first, we thought it was weather and forest land.  Now we know it is all drug related.
@nydia_han @ABC Spanish is second widely spoken language in the U.S.  in NYC with no exception.  Customer spoke Spanish why can't rest of us speak English back to them.  Not so sure what made him so uptight toward them.  I understand Spanish speakers can get loud and obnoxious.  Threat is wrong
@annafifield @danielleinjapan Japan " Sardine Can" Subway.
@freekorea_us North Korea is known to be Mafia State.  No high expectation.  Mr. Bolton not highly educated on North Korea makes matter worse.
Korean Peninsula is having heavy Rainfall.  Plus North Korea lacks pavement road.  Why did North Korea cancel the meeting with South Korea??? Take a wild guess.
@Robert_E_Kelly Kim Jung Un has no choice to end his Nuclear Program.  Money has more power than Missiles.  Final Conclusion.  Economy rules.
@BuckTurgidson79 I disagree 100 percent.  You cannot end it one-way approach.  Nobody is stupid.
@JChengWSJ @hj257 Wrong card to play for Kim Jung Un.
@MailOnline Crazy Ass Paki in the act.
@JChengWSJ Bolton will never work on North Korea. The reason why South Korea keeping it cool. Plus Old North Korea late Kim Dynasty followers are too scared to give up power for Capitalism. The reason they will all lose job or defect to a foreign land.  Many of them will defect to Russia
@freekorea_us 31-year-old Punk the Lawmaker.

@chadocl North Korea Old timers who supported late Kim's not ( Kim Jung Un).  Do not want to give up their power.   A power struggle is happening within North Korea.
@JohnDelury @Michael_NKLW @Sierra_NKLW Kim Kye Gwan ( Oldtimer)  Old G.   Old conservative background follower who served late Kim Dynasty.   There is a good chance slip of his tongue can lead himself in North Korea death sentence.
@NoonInKorea Reform like Vietnam or China ( Both Communist) both have red flags.
@Robert_E_Kelly @WonkVJ Keep in mind there are many " Chairman Kim" in South Korea too also to be boot-licking is necessary for these gangsters.
@annafifield @ArmsControlWonk If Bolton knows where is North Korea is located.....................
@JChengWSJ @Robert_E_Kelly North Korea Bolt.
@annafifield Keep in mind:  comment is from old conservative Kim Dynasty follower Kim Kye Gwan.  We should worry if Kim Jung Un or Kim Jung Un sister said it.  If not take everybody else comment in North Korea with a grain of salt.
@nktpnd @BuckTurgidson79 This time comment is from old conservative group person. Name Kim Kye Gwan.  He was old Kim Dynasty follower.   Who has a real voice in this is Kim Jung Un himself or Kim Jung Un blood sister.
@BuckTurgidson79 Are you really serious Kim Jung Un will touch with US presence in ROK angle????? so is Kim Jung Un drunk???????
@minseon_ku Can the idiot be Bolton???
@motokorich @choesanghun @MarkLandler The difference is North Korea unpredictable country time is running out.  Current day North Korea is can Kim Jung Un family stay alive for next century like old conservative timer like Kim Kye Gwan has no idea or does not care Kim Jung Un family lives or not.  That's a difference
@mgerrydoyle Do not believe or trust  Past Kim Dynasty old conservative timers.  Who holds real power next to Kim Jung Un is her sister.   If she said it.  We should worry if not take it as Grain of Salt.
@McFaul @JChengWSJ The question that I always had.  Is John Bolton going to be helpful to the US and North Korea dialogue?  Clearly shows he isn't..................
@motokorich Kim Kwe-Kw an is an old conservative follower of late Kim family:  Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il. I would just take with " Grain of Salt".  The reason is Kim Kwe Kwan is not part of Kim Jung Un team. He has become conservative group outsider. Who holds real power is Kim Jung Un sister
@annafifield Keep in Mind:  North Korea foreign minister is not under Kim Jung Un team.  He is conservative old Kim family ( Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il) follower.  I would take it with " Grain of Salt".
@willripleyCNN Kim Jung Un had no idea right?!  I think there are groups of people in North Korea upper elites who are afraid Kim Jung Un giving up power.  This is what it all means.
@annafifield not exactly sure who is this Kim Kye Gwan guy.  But if Kim Jung Un finds out what he have done.  He would probably receive an execution in North Korea style.
@AlastairGale Angle is coming from Russia................. Don't you think???????????????????????
@willripleyCNN Not exactly sure what Kim Kye Gwan North Korea is talking about but Weather wise it is Raining in Korea.  If the weather clears up.  We would have a better understanding of North Korea Foreign Affairs is saying........
@ReutersUS If it Rains today the sun will be out tomorrow.
@jackiebensen @nbcwashington Rain??? or Natural cause???
@Daily_Express Far too many stabbers in London.  Why?????
@RichardHaass The Middle East is like Volcano.  Lava is ready to come out.  Like Big Island Hawaii.
@annafifield @MichaelTCucek Rest In Peace.  My freedom friend.
@EdwardHBOh You should always remember South Korea has it too.  Not only North Korea.  Fundamentally it is " Korean" problems.
@tokyoreporter Japanese woman stabbing Japanese guy.  It has a very long history.  The fundamental reason why Japanese birthrates are very low.  Sex battle has a long history. Korean Comfort Woman issue and having sex with 15 old.  Japanese men are mentally sick people Japanese woman knows it!!
@JChengWSJ It means.  Fundamentally Kim Jung Un is not ready.  He is a scared person.  Do not be a surprise if his drunk at the moment.
@willripleyCNN Will.  1 month period.  We will see and hear Korean Soap Drama play out.  We will see many episodes of Drama.  Coming out from North Korea News Media.  Not really fundamentally high expectation drama.  Past 70 years same Drama.
@BuckTurgidson79 Smart move. But Kim Jung Un fundamental big mistake was using Nuclear Weapon threat the USA and Neighbor nations.   No Nuclear power use threat tactics including USA, Russia, China, India, Isreal,  only North Korea that was a fundamental big mistake.
@joshrogin Her smile says worrisome.
@BuckTurgidson79 Yes, I agree.  Not Korean Soap Drama.  Within next 1 month.  We will have plenty of episodes.
@MailOnline Fellow Arab killing Arab.  Perfect example for Arab.
@Robert_E_Kelly Probably low-level KCNA news.  I agree with you 100 percent.
@OlenaHeu Not in Big Island Hawaii.
@MissMiaKang Love that picture.
@willripleyCNN Max Thunder.  It's real Thunder!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@LynnKawano Lava and Volcano aren't over.  Forget North Korea Missile Threat.  The real threat to the State of Hawaii is Natural making Lava and Volcano.  Hawaii Local Source.
@JChengWSJ Probably all-time smart investment from Kim Jung Un.
@oinkorea Side effect.  Wrong investment.
@martyn_williams No High Expectation.  1 month Korean Soap Opera Drama will exist.....................
@BuckTurgidson79 No high expectations.  We all should fundamentally know when Kim Jung Un thinks straight,  Kim Jung Un is scared,  Kim Jung Un is drunk,  Kim Jung Un is not thinking straight from KCNA North Korea News Media.  Just if that is real News Media.
@EdwardHBOh @_ARuggiero Common sense tells me.  If Koreans want to deal with North Korea or Koreans want to think and act toward Korean Unification.  Just take a look at South Korea has mirror flection case dealing with North Korea.  Fundamentally both Koreans just with fundamental ideology differences
@DailyMail Never gets old.  No High Expectation coming from North Korea News Media.  If North Korea ever had news media.
@EdwardHBOh 1) North Korea 1 month drama will exist and happen until President Trump meets Kim Jung Un.  2) KCNA ( North Korea News Media) is clear example when Kim Jung Un thinks straight or Kim Jung Un does not think straight.  3) South Korea and USA alliance are not under North Korea term
@MetroUK Looks like a total bum.
@YonhapNews @ELINTNews Who is not keeping up with the bargain is it South Korea or North Korea?????
@MissMiaKang Type of body I like.
@oinkorea Name game reminds me KIA.   Americans said KIA will never sell well in the USA because reminds them Military slang Killed in Action actually it means Korean Pronunciation word Gear.  Now KIA cars selling and doing well in U.S. Market and around the World.
@oinkorea How would South Koreans react to North Korea pop???? if they have one and plus the majority of Koreans live and work in where??????????
@annafifield I cannot trust or believe negative mind thinkers.
@michikokakutani Japanese History Book is a perfect example.
@MailOnline @DailyMail Typical Thai " BangCock" in action.
@koreatimescokr Reason 1) Not many Koreans getting married with the International couple.  Reason 2) South Korea/ Marriage court still practice outdated system.  They get a divorce from the host country, not in South Korea.
@NME Was the actress a smoker????
@AlastairGale South Korea/ Korean comfort woman issue.  15 year old abducted to sex slavery during Japan Fascist WW.II.  Not very smart angle USA!!!!!!!!!!! Not smart.
@YonhapNews Hope for the good.
@MetroUK Do you think this is " Cause and Effect" reaction??? Is there hidden story Israel and Arabs not telling us.????? You tell me.
@insight_co_kr Psychopath at work.
@JohnDelury USA and Israel will play a big part of it.
@FD_SignsOfWar Reality Iran is weak and scared to attack Israel.
@koreatimescokr RIP.  My friend.
@JChengWSJ 70 years isolation. Having two political and economical allies that has worse human rights record ( China and Russia). Bringing up Human Rights would really help.
@tokyoreporter We call it " Time Bomb" personality trait.  It is called Asian Psychopath trait.
@koreatimescokr It all depends on " Political" angle.  It is sad that Arab people cannot unite and help fellow Arab people.   Koreans are not all that behind in sadness on helping and uniting fellow Koreans.
@JohnDelury China is saying they can rule the world or surpass the United States any day or night.  In reality, I do not think so................
@yonhaptweet My Personal Opinion.  He is very " inconsistent" soccer player.   Any team player has an inconsistent player.  Play flip-flops left and right.   Simply in Company environment, he was fired from the team.   It is time Korean News Media report information straight.
@BuckTurgidson79 Do you know Korean Peninsula ( North, South) and Israel all three Nations are 70 years old?
@businessinsider I really do not like to hear " Aftermath" comments.  Why could he not say it when Steve Jobs was alive????
@wikitree If only Koreans from both sides can travel freely.  Like North and South Ireland.   Only Koreans are wishing for before Unification begins.
@YonhapNews Great phone.  Love LG too.
@annafifield North Korea was isolated for 70 years.  If President Trump can open and crack North Korea isolation open North Korea to Modern World.  That will help South Korea and United States rest of the World.  North Korea people need food and infrastructure to survive next century not War
@nypost Young Punk end his life.  Playing with guns.  This is what happens.
@Ian56789 What is your point?????
@SouthKoreanew South Korea is a clear example.  What happens to a team if Korean players do not step up and execute the play to make goal but instead depend on and rely on foreign players.
@nydia_han RIP.
@EdwardHBOh Like KCNA represents the majority of Koreans.  Get real.
@JChengWSJ He is not wearing it.  Why the fuss???????????????
@KasulisK Reality woman takes a big role in Korean Culture and Korean history.  All wars are fought for a woman.  Keep that in mind.
@BuckTurgidson79 Psychopath.
@themichellewie @nikesportswear Sexy bootie.  Nice.
@CNETNews He sang so well.  Koreans went crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@oinkorea Please choose a better location in South Korea.  South Korea has many areas that Marvel Movies can choose.
@Robert_E_Kelly Coming from John Bolton angle.  A person who hasn't served Military or Major War.  Promotes War over Diplomatic Peace.  I only keep my fingers crossed.  But who knows President Trump and Kim Jung Un can end up holding hands together.
@JoeTerwilliger @dennisrodman Dude.
@OhMyGOFF lmao
@annafifield North Korea as a nation is broken 70 years ago.  You should always consider it.
@annafifield How about WW.II South Korea Comfort Woman 15 year old kidnapped by Japanese troops?????? Fascist Japan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

@vicenews @HBO Try China.
@mbnlive His old.  He needs to go.  He reminds me of John Bolton.
@ThisWeekABC @JChengWSJ @MarthaRaddatz He will size him up??????????? You as clearly see John Bolton angle.  John Bolton never served as Military.  Yeah, Size him up.  John Bolton Size Kim Jung Un up.

@freekorea_us You have good point.   South Korea two face policy toward Law and Order.  This is one I agree.  I personally have many experiences in South Korea.  Not with North Korea just local domestic issues.
@EW Carrie Fisher RIP.
@freekorea_us Told you so.  Minority group does not represent the Majority of Koreans.  Including North and South.  You should worry more about Okinawa, Japan more so than South Korea.  My Honest truth.
@JChengWSJ Pyeongtaek.  Largest U.S. Base outside of USA territory.  President Trump administration is complaining.  You know what US 150 years old Allie Japan want U.S. base in Okinawa to leave!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@oinkorea I really miss that dude in Walking Dead.  Afterward he left the show.  The show has been really Walking Dead!!!!!! If you know what I mean.............................

@KasulisK @PRI North Korea and Iran are two different Nation in World Geo Political Arena.  North East Asia has World Powerful Nations surrounding Korean Peninsula ( Russia, USA, China, and Japan).  5,000 Years Koreans survived.  More than Jews.
@DailyMail Eyes say it all.  Final Conclusion:  Perverts come in all shapes and sizes.
@JohnDelury Do not be surprised if Airforce, Navy, Marine, Brigades,  becomes major players.
@BuckTurgidson79 @UPI A gift to " Statue of Liberty".
@ananavarro @kellysadler45 Kelly, very low comment.  John McCain served major War,  John McCain served in U.S. Navy.   What you said and your comment was very inhuman and very low.  Not like you.  The comment was very low.
@AndreaRBerger Very smart idea.  John Bolton never served or fought a major war.  Plus he has no idea of Korean Peninsula.  Simply No idea. The U.S. Military Base in South Korea is 70 years grass root. Even Koreans,  President Moon,  North Korea Kim Jung Un had no saying! Fundamental Grassroot!
@MichaelAvenatti Making Promo Movie for the current day situation.
@BuckTurgidson79 Why is Fascist Abe in this picture?  Is there Kim Jung Un and Fascist Abe meeting happening soon???????
@JohnDelury North Korea needs plenty of it " Economy".
@jbulley1 @JChengWSJ Sexy Girls.
@Robert_E_Kelly The angle here is Kim Jung Un and President Trump meeting isn't " Mind Trip".
@JChengWSJ @hj257 South Korea Navy and Airforce will play a much bigger role.  Plus Marines and Brigades.
@annafifield Last Time I saw crow ripping food from Grocery Store.  No big news. If Crow sexually harasses a girl in Tokyo or Rape a Woman in Tokyo.  It will be big news.
Instagram service so lousy and bad.  What the fuck is happening with customer service.  Always asking fucking verification numbers through email or cell phone numbers.   Is Instagram Spy service or What!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Instagram SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@insight_co_kr 마약 투쟁!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@nypost She-Male voted for President Trump.
@chadocl So now they want to return to North Korea???? Let them return.
@oinkorea You mean the Workers.
@TheKoreaHerald Singapore is feeling " World Cup in Politics".
@EdwardHBOh Just strawberries remind me Japanese flag.  But Edward Oh you can see and feel it differently.  I seriously do not mind.
@Robert_E_Kelly Old News from last two years.
@NoonInKorea Now I think DMZ meeting can bring old wounds mindset back.  I think Singapore small enough for good security and neutral place for serious talk. So Singapore it is.
@oinkorea Long flight.  Weather Hot and Humid.  Singapore role model for North Korea.  Very smart idea.
@freekorea_us Only thing I worry about his Singapore Air flight distance plus Hot and Humid weather.  President Trump will be drinking plenty of Ice Tea.  DMZ would probably have been much better placed.  Probably President wants to show Kim Jung Un Singapore has a role model.
@martfack President Trump going further Geographically than Korean Peninsula.  Hope his not tired.  Weather gets hot and humid.  I preferred DMZ my honest truth.
@willripleyCNN Will,  interview with Kim Jung Un????
@KathyHSMoon @chosonexchange @NCNKorea @newsjean @motokorich @duyeonkim @DrJaySong @keepark So far so good.  Keep my fingers cross.
@TheKoreaHerald So much better quality Korean food.  This is not one of them.
@willripleyCNN It was a tragedy but reason why Three Korean American stayed alive even though in harsh jail cell environment because they did not steal.  Stealing is a serious crime in North and South Korea.  Especially at North Korea.
@willripleyCNN All three of them.  Including Tony Kim.
@oinkorea Hope it works but " I Seoul U"  Seoul slogan need to go ASAP.  Reason does not make sense.
@oinkorea South Korea " Me Too" movement needs simplification.   Some of victim CCTV caught video look like murder victim rather than sexually related rape.
@NoonInKorea Let him go back get deported back to North Korea.  I realize it is their destiny.
@NoonInKorea All three better change location fast.  If all three gets kidnap again.  The USA will not help again if not need to wait a long time.  Plus I think 1 year or 2 years they cannot travel because North Korea and the USA does not have diplomatic ties.
@Mhowell003 @fox5dc Gang-related.
@NoonInKorea Smarter Choice.
@NoonInKorea Airforce 1.
@annafifield Time North Korea/ Move forward join the World ( Business, Economic, Trade).  Afterward Human Rights, Rest will fall into place.
@MissMiaKang If you able to share very honest truthful communication is a key point in the relationship. If you are setting up a standard that is very superficial.
@JChengWSJ Tony Kim,  North Korea is not Disneyland.
@MailOnline Girls.  Thong is much better.
@jaketapper @willripleyCNN My God.  Kim Dong Chul Detained 2015!!!!! God has blessed all three them.
@chadocl About time.
@marklevinshow His occupation is a lawyer.  His client is Porno Star.  You must distinguish it clearly.  There are very big differences between the two.
@annafifield @CMorelloWP Would all three visit North Korea again???? just asking.
@Robert_E_Kelly Bolton again.  What would Bolton ask?????
@BBCNewsAsia Taiwan Sucks.
@freekorea_us Moon Chung wasn't born in Korean War.  He reminds me " Spoiled Child".
@tokyoreporter Honda becoming a pervert.
@boston25 The dog did not like no medical blood supplier.
@chadocl North Korea and Iran two different nations.
@annafifield @YonhapNews Good about time.
@BuckTurgidson79 She wore glasses before the meeting took place.  I would like to say.
@freekorea_us Never is the answer because South Korea democratic elected President Moon did not say U.S. Military withdraw South Korea. He said and the majority of Koreans think and feel U.S. Military should be stationed in South Korea signed a Peace agreement with North Korea or not. Answer!!
@freekorea_us South Korea President Moon,  North Korea Kim Jung Un,  Koreans never said anything about U.S. Withdraw from South Korea.  That angle came from John Bolton and President Trump.  Keep that in mind.  Koreans said nothing....... Who's making up this story!!!!!
@ambchrishill @realDonaldTrump I agree with you 100 percent.  The U.S. Troop reduction even South Korea President Moon denied Kim Jung Un North Korea said nothing.  Why is President Trump bringing that an issue even though South Korea government paying for U.S. Troops to be stationed in South Korea? 70 years!
@freekorea_us @ABC That North Korea guy works for DMZ Tour guide and South Korea celebrity.
@Robert_E_Kelly Holding hands with President Trump.
@annafifield No surprise.  Spies follow the money.
@JohnDelury Wall Album.

@wikitree 강수지 가 증말 아갑다!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@annafifield Both leaders faces are red.  What can that mean??? You tell me.
@Daily_Express @RealHughJackman He will be missed.  Why can't James Bond movies just introduce next Bond cleanly?  Just say or end the movie  James Bond contract is over and he introduces a new guy to the agent.  Simply fans would have an idea who is next to James Bond would be.
@AFP For Peace.
@guardian Isn't this " Atlanta TV show" guy.??????
@YonhapNews For Peace.  No Bullshit.
@OliverHotham @kylepopeza @XHNews Kim Jung Un you get really serious and denuclearize.  I mean seriously denuclearize.  No Joke!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No Ball rubbing, No Prostate Massage.
@freekorea_us Yes, you should know.  The U.S. Military in South Korea means business.  Never underestimate U.S. Military power in South Korea.
@MailOnline Updated Russian made aircraft.
@CNNNSdigital Top of Mountain???
@AlastairGale Creative but indirectly it can mean.  Your cleaning my shoes.   Politically it can mean this is payback not having Japan Embassy in Jerusalem
@ZNEWSNET It's called " Sardine Can".  Correct expression.
@freekorea_us Are you serious???? The U.S. in South Korea has Weapons.  Have you ever stationed in Osan?????
@STForeignDesk As long Japan ( Fascist Government) reminds Koreans " Excess baggage of history'.  I guess Koreans will respond according to Japan Fascist Government needs.
@KasulisK Hey, do not overdo it.   Chungmuro Pet stores do not sell sick pets but South Korea should stop or ban all pets.  If the owner cannot manage pets properly do not own it.
@OhMyGOFF @eunyangnbc @nbcaaron @nbcwashington hahahahahahaha.  Very cute.
@annafifield @reglash @washingtonpost If a Male person walks like that it means one thing.  A male person has prostate cancer.
@AlastairGale Kim Jung Un going to Singapore????? You tell me.
@HammerJer @HawaiiNewsNow Yes, I know.
@annafifield What is it???? outdated Coca-Cola????
@JChengWSJ If he knows all the answer to North Korea problems. If he knows all the angles to North Korea problems.  Why did he stop working for President Trump administration??? I find this guy a person awkwardly bias person. This is the type of person I simply cannot trust.
@DavidNakamura Like Kim Jung Un and sister relationship.
5/8/2018: Clarification is needed in Hata Clan Wikipedia section.  Hata Clan is Korean Clan not Chinese or Jewish.  Hata Clan came from Korean Peninsula ( Baekje and Shilla Kingdom) settled and established what is today Kyoto, Nara Japan.  That is Truth!! Do not trust in lies!!!!
@TIME How about Anti- North Korea Kim Jung Un Tweets?????? North Korea leader not saying anything about it.  Plus Hollywood Joke Movies on North Korea.  Why is it such one-way bias news reporting all the time in U.S. media!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@BuckTurgidson79 Hong Joon-Pyo is from planet Mars.
@BuckTurgidson79 Batman.
@KoreanUpdates She made a very smart choice.  South Korea Entertainment schedule is crazy and terrible.  They are not robots.
@cnni He died in the USA.   A nation that he served.  Road-rage stabbing.  Bad Karma.
@martfack Taro Aso.  Japan finance minister family surname can be translated in so many ways. Monstly not positive way.
@GIKorea The problem here is it does not help North Korea people.  It creates Kim Jung Un North Korea Government crackdown on his own people easily.  In many ways Human Right Activists giving death sentence to North Korea people if they find it in North Korea.
@CNN @StCollinson How long can it last???? That is a very big question.  Like North Korea Kim Jung Un.   People do not want to grill him too hard.  Then we have vacant World Power leadership can become very dangerous in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East around the World.
@tokyoreporter How about in Japan woman restroom.  Probably infested with a hidden camera.
@Newsweek Have you ever heard Spanish speaking population????  Like Texas, or California.
@oinkorea Probably not in Seoul.
@KasulisK You don't think Korea Starbucks is quiet????
@annafifield She has to pop up like South Koreans cannot forget Comfort Woman.  Japan Fascist Abe government gets pissed off if Child monument stares in front of Japan Embassy how bias as Fck is that!!!!!!!!
@RoostersDaddy @BetsyKling Creature from Black Lagoon.
@asiapress_nk 25 만명 고생 하는 색이들!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 지도 대문내.
@annafifield @AmySpiro It means Abe is Shoe wiper.
@annafifield It means do not forget " Holocaust" Fascist Abe Government.
@yunsukCNA Panmunjom probably is the best place.
@oinkorea Not from President Moon ( South Korea) or Kim Jung Un ( North Korea) suggestion. Angle is probably coming from John Bolton or President Trump.
@JamesTurnbull ChinaTown.  ( Drug and Sex).  Only Black money accepted.
@Newsweek Apple Pie????
@JChengWSJ @caspervdveen Organized Crime does exist in North Korea?  Who can be Godfather.  Please take a wild guess????
@motokorich Especially in President Trump administration.
@MailOnline Fat ass Frenchy woman.
@MissMiaKang Sexual Orgasm has no numbers, especially for Older Woman.  Keep in mind older woman crave for sex much more than older man.
@LynnKawano When Lava creeps into the neighborhood it is very scary.  I wish all the best Big Island.
@tokyoreporter Hammer Head.
@oinkorea Common sense:  Limit the side dish.  It will limit food waste.
@MissMiaKang Chyna ( Past) female wrestler was Porno star.  She let 18 year old gang bang her left and right.  Nobody said anything.
@JChengWSJ @hj257 Reality is far left or far left does not represent 80 Million South Koreans living in South Korea or Abroad. President Moon or Kim Jung Un ( North Korea) did not say anything about U.S. Troop withdraw or as a bargaining chip.Clearly, you can see as " John Bolton"angle not Koreans
@oinkorea One crazy ass religion.
@annafifield @ColinKahl @NarangVipin @washingtonpost President Trump has fundamental problem Korean Peninsula/ North East Asia isn't the Middle East.
@JChengWSJ @hj257 Coming from President Trump angle more than President Moon ( South Korea).  Peace struck does not mean withdraw U.S. Military forces in South Korea.  That is what China Communist Party ( Media and People) I do not trust.  Plus Russia Putin.  Has history doing crazy ass shit!!!!!!
@annafifield You mean " Taiwan" parade.   I realize many of them wore a yellow banana condom that said: " Suck my Cock".
@EdwardHBOh I know what you meant. Your analogy was very cheezy that was my point.
@annafifield He looks totally like typical " China Town Street Bum".
@oinkorea Crazy ass Shit.
@oinkorea You should try that Cheezy Date Online site called " Bagel Meets Coffee" that has a connection with South Korea Unification Church.
@motokorich Can it work in Japan??? Land of Japan Government that allows Yakuza to exist plus Japan Porno/ Adult Industry to thrive.   It is impossible " Me Too" movement take a foothold in Japan.  It is nearly impossible.
Avoid:  Dating site/ Dating application called " Bagel meets Coffee" very cheezy site that links to South Korea Unification Church.  DO NOT USE THE WEBSITE AND SERVICE.
@TIME There is a difference between Public space and the Private space.   If a child is loud in public space.  Not all people can handle it.   While the child is young.  Parents should teach respect public space.
@AuthorJCha @koryoinleiden It does not help North Korea people.  북한 주민들 눈치 만 주는것 금지 생각합니다.
@Robert_E_Kelly Do not tell me he got it wrong!!!!
@BuckTurgidson79 He looks like total street bum!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@JTBC_news She needs a stronger lawyer.  South Korea breeds criminals because the system allows them too.  I completely can understand her situation.  Like today there are many ignorant Koreans living in Apartment.  Making noises, shouting, spitting, smoking etc
@yonhaptweet Is he making a movie???
@SouthKoreanew If it helps North Korea people.  Reality it does not.
@BuckTurgidson79 You are saying.  His not dead.
@MissMiaKang Triple GGG KO's his opponent.  I care.  I am his fan.
@NHLonNBCSports Name it " Bonker Cup".
@HawaiiNewsNow Lava is creeping in.
@motokorich I want Maguro Sushi.
@NoonInKorea Not only for now.  For future for Kim Jung Un/ North Korea.
@JChengWSJ North Korea must join hands with South Korea and USA.   Japan later on.
@NHLonNBCSports My eyes hurt.
@NHLonNBCSports Take a look at those guys.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@allyjung Cho family ( Mother) was  Korean Air ( Urban Legend).   She was Anal Queen for using violence.
@NoonInKorea Whenever we listen North Korea defectors speak.  We always need to hear and listen to them with a grain of salt.  The reason is Tae Yong Ho never left his home his embassy or interacted with foreign Ambassador while he was North Korea ambassador in Great Britain.   No world idea!
Volcano Lava is creeping up State of Hawaii neighborhood.
@NoonInKorea Having War it isn't part of program buddy!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@NoonInKorea So is he returning back to North Korea?????
@BuckTurgidson79 What is world reality???? that is what you should report and why!!!!!
@HawaiiNewsNow Lava has invaded Hawaii.  God bless Oahu Island.
@JChengWSJ Save money??? Does President Trump has any idea South Korea Government are paying for 30,000 U.S. Troops stationed in South Korea??? plus South Korea defense is not given or one-way relationship.  Past 70 years it has worked both ways.  Clearly, President Trump is not thinking!!!
@EdwardHBOh Battered Spouse Syndrome???? the very childish cheezy line that your using.  Big differences between North and South Korea for past 70 years they have been politically and economically divorced.
@cnni President Park Chung Hee helped to build South Korea economy.  I get the impression President Moon is against Capitalism and Democracy.  I might be wrong. I hope and wish everything goes well.  Fundamental big test for Kim Jung Un.
@MailOnline All those girls seemed drugged.
@nypost STD.  He catches " Carpet" tongue.
@freekorea_us Kim Jung Un should be tired.  Just imagine all things he must do.  For once his using all his brain cells.
@nydia_han @6abc Nice.
@minseon_ku Is it bad???  What Japanese Fascist Abe Government hate the most is " United Korea" on everything.
@cnni Is he stupid or what????
@frankaum1 Far too many Fake News.  Is reading News becoming real.  That is a question.
@TheLeadCNN @willripleyCNN @jaketapper Witch Hunt.
@NoonInKorea Go make a movie.
@chadocl Isn't this an old news.
5/5/2018:  Los Angeles:  Korea Town is becoming " Homeless Shelter" center for Los Angeles City shelter center.  My question is why the fuck!!!!!!!! These Los Angeles homeless people going to piss, shit, not take shower, totally stink up Korea Town businesses.  Idea so fucked up!
@JChengWSJ Common sense tells me that too.  No Surprise.  The biggest surprise is President Trump reducing U.S. Military in South Korea angle. President Moon ( SK) or Kim Jung Un ( NK). Never mentioned it but President Trump has to say it the https://t.co/emzxkWh6ln big Stupid Surprise!
@oinkorea Los Angeles,  Korea Town is becoming center of Los Angeles Homeless Shelter center. FUCK YOU TOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@NHLonNBCSports Boston not going to take that.  I sure you.
@JedediahBila Filming Back into the future movie????
@ashleyfeinberg classic case not knowing arm space.
@josungkim @minseon_ku Yeah, 70 years if U.S. military increased it. Probably next Korean War would have happened. The U.S. military in South Korea always has been 30,000-50,000 troops. Keep in mind U.S. Military Weapon arsenal / U.S. intelligence has never been reduced for past 70 years in South Korea
@NarangVipin The problem here is why is President Trump exposing himself to Kim Jung Un target.  President Moon or Kim Jung Un never said about U.S. Military reduce in South Korea.  Why is President Trump bring it up to discussion with Kim Jung Un?? President Trump shooting himself own foot!!
@StormyDaniels She reminds me President Trump second wife.
What is wrong with President Trump?? Reducing U.S. forces in South Korea does not help U.S. National Security or Korean Peninsula aka North East Asia National Security. A political and Economic angle that I see from President Trump is he wants to dupe South Korea to pay money!!!!
@thisthatamy Not miscommunication.  It is called President Trump " Miscalculation".   He forgot West and East policy.   Directly it means Washington DC United States of America is directly screwed.
@nktpnd Clearly shows President Trump isn't thinking straight. Reducing U.S. Forces in South Korea only justifies Russia and China military expansion in North East Asia and South East Asia then directly threat U.S. National Interest.  Do not forget Hawaii, Alaska, and Guam is nearby.
@Robert_E_Kelly This Angle is coming from President Trump believe it or not.   Not even Korean side both North or South.   President Trump has no idea.  The real reason ( China and Russia) military expansion in North East Asia and South East Asia.  Directly threat to the USA!!!!
@nktpnd This angle is coming from President Trump not even South Korea President Moon or Noth Korea Kim Jung Un.  Who made the biggest mistake here.  You tell me.
@FinancialTimes Very hard and difficult for " Me Too" movement take place in Japan.   Japan system does not allow it.  Common Sense:  If Japan Government allows Yakuza,  Porno Business to exist.  Me Too Japanese woman movement will suffer.
@oinkorea Very smart idea for China.
@MetroUK He should ask for help.
@elisewho Are they alive??????????? Keep in mind.  Many years have passed.
@COLLEGEBADDlES 4,1,2,3,
@chadocl Do not be surprised if Kim Jung Un takes ( Ex-President Park Chung Hee) economic model.  That model fits current day North Korea well.
@annafifield In the end.  What did protesters accomplish?
@oinkorea Called " North Korea" dipshit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@DefenseNewsC Oatmeal.  Probably the best solution.
@SouthKoreanew No future.
@oinkorea Yeah, no problem.
@washingtonpost Master Lee.   Taekwondo Godfather.  RIP.  He officially introduces Taekwondo ( Korean Martial Art) to the USA.
@BuckTurgidson79 The year 2050 it will be China, Russia or even Japan that going to challenge North East Asia regional supremacy.  Trust me having U.S. Military stationed in Korean Peninsula going to help the World no matter what.
@MissMiaKang Mia, I went to the store behind you in Hong Kong called Nepal.
@annafifield Are you really stupid enough to believe and trust U.S. Military Base leaving South Korea??? It will never happen.  For past 70 years stationed in South Korea.  Fought Korean War,  Lost lives, bloodshed.  Thinking about Leaving??? The year 2050 it will be China, Russia, or Japan!!
@annafifield Now would they bail him out of Jail?????
@samkimasia Just bad timing.
@annafifield Basketball and President Trump Book delivery.
@willripleyCNN CNN: reporting the very short-sighted news.  Give time for North Korea to modernize. 70 years self-isolation screwed up people's mind inside North Korea.
@oinkorea Even Mongolia follows Korean traits.
@andreilankov I always knew you will write something negative or put cold water on everything.  Welcome to communist and socialist Russian Putin viewpoint.
@annafifield @washingtonpost Job Posting:  Media are controlled by China Communist Party.
@mbcnews Most people defend themselves or fight back.   They do not get punched and die.
@insight_co_kr No, duh.  Japan has never has been a safe place.
@EdwardHBOh Like South Korean woman had no clue she was cheating???? The whole story is missing. I mean accurate news.
@elisewho In what planet????
@BBCNewsAsia China is saying.  See this Taiwan.
@hankookilbo I think it is time for her to lead the party.  Party needs her leadership.  That guy is old and outdated.
@BBCLBicker @ProducerKathy Nice.
@willripleyCNN Do not be surprised if Kim Jung Un takes Libya model of Nuclear abandonment and take South Korea ex-President Park Chung Hee economic plan because that tragedy fits perfectly with current day North Korea.
@MailOnline Stupidity at best.  Fucking Gandhi's.
@MailOnline Teen??? She looks like Middle School Student.   Being rape in India.  Typical.
@allyjung @AFP She had no idea?????? Typical Korean Woman.
@JChengWSJ During that time  President Moon and Kim Jung Un were having a personal conversation for 30 minutes at the bench nearby DMZ.  China spyplane got nothing from DMZ breeze.
@EdwardHBOh Do you jump the stairways or walk the stairways????
@OhMyGOFF Hulk Hogan LMAO.
@gailkimITSME Good point.
@Newsweek Does comedian Michelle Wolf has any idea that White House spokeswoman is a very hard job.  When it gets too personal it becomes not funny.

@tokyoreporter All for the watch.  Sounds like Chinese of Vietnamese origin.
@danielrtudor Kim Jung Un follows ( South Korea Park Chung Hee) economic model.  Do not be surprised because economic model fits current day North Korea well.
@JChengWSJ @timothywmartin I use Samsung.  They need to fix and simplify Samsung customer service.
@nydia_han Car Ran off the road incident.  Terrible.
@oranckay In China!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@JChengWSJ KCNA should always keep in mind.  What makes people happy is not socialist, Fascist,  it is Democracy.
@jooheecho @ABC From Now.  His action ( Kim Jung Un) must show to build " World Trust".
@CBSNews Crazy ass news.
@KoreanUpdates She is such a sexy cuttie.
@hankookilbo Some International Airplanes have rats and snakes.  For example American and United Airlines.
@JohnDelury Xi sends China Airplane into South Korea Air Zone.   Not surprised.  Plus Xi is busy with Taiwan Straight.
North Korea does not need Nuclear Weapon to be a powerful nation.  Kim Jung Un can simply take ( South Korea Park Chung Hee) economic path in which it fits perfectly with current day North Korea.  Within 7-10 years North Korea can change drastically.
@tokyoreporter He supposed to be " Kamen Pervert Rider".
@DavidNakamura Meaning whom??? Donald or Kim???
@elisewho Setting South Korea time.  Smart choice.
@oinkorea Asian bowl for your Seoul.   Would have been a better slogan.
@willripleyCNN Setting South Korea time.  Smart choice.
@minseon_ku You'll realize after talking to Kim Jung Un. Kim Jung Un will take North Korea into ( Ex-President Park Chung Hee) economic path.
@JChengWSJ Koreas agreed to unify standard time.
@TheKoreaHerald About time.
@AskAKorean Do not be surprised if Kim Jung Un takes North Korea into ( Ex-President Park Chung Hee) Economic path.
@oinkorea Pyongyang Naengmyun.   All Koreans like even Half Korean.   Korean 02b DNA food.
@oinkorea America understands " Korean Pride" not America go away.
@OhMyGOFF @Robert_Ellis3 @ssjuk22 Nice.  You look simple and beautiful.
@rpcward89 @benjaminkatzeff Soon Kim Jung Un will be following Park Chung Hee economic plan.  Which fits well with North Korea.
@annafifield The U.S. military man cut off the tree from North Korea side.  ( You missed writing that).
@willripleyCNN @CNN @cnni The weather was nice for event coverage.
@nypost Need love.
@freekorea_us To be fair Assad is stupid enough to use it ( North Korea made poison gas or not).
@martyn_williams Reality how many North Korea average people watch TV???? so what is the use reporting it? Plus no such thing as News in North Korea.
@elisewho Kim Jung Un.  It goes both ways not one-way direction.
@oinkorea President Trump, we thank you.   You did 50 percent.
@oinkorea You mean John Lennon right?!
@willripleyCNN Only if  Koreans can travel North and South like Ireland.  Very big accomplish between two nations.
@annafifield Smart idea for Kim.  Only option probably smart idea.
@willripleyCNN No war in Korean Peninsula.   Korean Pride.
@allyjung It is https://t.co/g39CQWYWU5 Jung Un is listening. Which he hasn't done it for many years.  Plus if CIA, Mossad, British Intelligence Agency,  China Communist Party Spies, Russia Putin Spies are watching or listening from the sky above. Body language plays a very big role.
@samkimasia Body language.  Plays very big role in meeting like this because CIA, Mossad, British Agents, Chinese Communist Party Spies,  Russia Putin Spies, all watching or listening from the sky above.
@KasulisK His listening.  Kim Jung Un hasn't done it for many years.
@KasulisK Talk, Talk, and more Talk.  Much better than Missile Threat and War.
@allyjung Discussion, Discussion, more Discussion needed between two Nations.  Much better than Military Parade,  Missiles threats,  War,  and Self Isolation.
@JChengWSJ Discussion, Discussion, and more Discussion between the two needed ASAP.  Much better than War, Military Parade,  Missiles, Allie Threat.
@minseon_ku @JChengWSJ Food is Food.  Just eat it.
@annafifield Keep my finger cross for next 70 years.  Even for Korean Unification.
@willripleyCNN More than 11 years try 70 years.
@willripleyCNN We know.  The angle that we have to understand.  Otto Warmbier committed a crime stealing North Korea propaganda poster.  That is where he gets very weak.  It had cause and effect to his death.
@oinkorea 200 boyfriend???? not sure about boyfriend but her sex client is more like it.
@willripleyCNN @CNN @cnni Korean Peninsula is not " Walking Dead" that is for sure.

@Newsweek Natalie Portman ( Marvel Thor Side) not Star Wars.
@MissMiaKang So hot and sexy.
@TheKoreaHerald Do you want perfect solution???? It will never happen.  Best solution.  Be happy what you got then work from there.  North Korea is seriously hurt from all angles.  Time Kim Jung Un need and work forward.   Sooner he knows it.  Better for Korean Peninsula as a whole.
@MailOnline Real monkey job.

@MissMiaKang Sex.  Thousand words.
@AnnieYuFox5 Pouring Rain with Coffee.  Sounds good.
@annafifield Need it North Korea.  Not in the U.S.
@BuckTurgidson79 About time.
@willripleyCNN I wish and hope North Korea goes forward with change.   Nation and leadership sure need it.   70 years isolation is enough.  Time for North Korea go forward with postive mind set changes.
@hankookilbo Very few good men.  You need more than human patience to live and work in Korea.
@NoonInKorea @BuckTurgidson79 It was UN economic and World trade sanction that made Kim Jung Un think deep.  Economy vs Missiles.
@willripleyCNN @nknewsorg Chinese tourist in North Korea.   Reason bridge isn't being built.  I wonder why????
@oinkorea I have my doubt on that one.
@hankookilbo Yup,  Children tend to learn a lot from Mother. Even bad behavior.
@freekorea_us You should watch your mouth on that one.  Your walking on the very narrow path.
@samkimasia One thing I do give President Moon credit.  He did serve Vietnam War.  Unlike President Trump and John Bolton.
@EdwardHBOh Korean Proverb:  Daughter like Mother.  Family traits/ DNA are dangerous.  Regarding too Korean Air two female boss.  Her mother was " Urban Legend".
@willripleyCNN Broadcasting all angle.  Busy week in Korea.
@annafifield I guess she was Okinawan.  Not even Japanese.
@annafifield Probably next destination.   Psy concert in May.

@MailOnline Please save the cat.  How the cat got stuck in the concrete????
@Robert_E_Kelly To be very honest.  President Trump brings on a lot of American Culture into the World stage.
@MailOnline Russian mother boyfriend is typical " Russian" pimp.
@hankookilbo North Korea no food.  You will die.
@chadocl North Korea can move forward if 25 million people including Kim Jung Un set there mind into it.  They have very big potential to be second Israel in North East Asia.  They need to set there mind.
@chadocl Nice picture for once.
@DrMarkPBarry What does Kim Jung Un want??? He wants to move forward.  Past 70 years North Korea gained nothing from the World.  Just Isolation.  He seriously needs Trade and Economy before Military and Missile threat shooting that's for sure.
@OhMyGOFF @nbcwashington He was a good actor. RIP.
@AimeeCho4 @nbcwashington Typical Porno addicted guy.  He found himself in a hard way.
@KBSnews The goose head.
@Robert_E_Kelly Does average American children know where is North Korea is located??? For me honestly, it comes as no surprise.
@JChengWSJ Smarter path desperately needed for Kim Jung Un.   The economy is first mission.
@JChengWSJ @VictorDCha @DavidNakamura Better than War.  Not bad of an idea.
@BuckTurgidson79 National Defence isn't based on Russia or China.
@tokyoreporter His eyes say pervert.
@oinkorea Walking Dead " Jesus" Coffee.  There is also Glenn Coffee nearby Daehan Theater.
@elisewho I supported Park Guen Hye.  After her downfall.  I realize.  It is better to have and to be open mind toward Korean Politics instead taking sides.
@realDonaldTrump @JChengWSJ About time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@annafifield @washingtonpost Very smart idea for Kim Jung Un.
@NarangVipin @JChengWSJ North Korea can develope Economy and Trade they will do fine.
@samkimasia South Korea is one big " Mega City".
@samkimasia Both made in South Korea.  Does it make any big differences???
@tokyoreporter A taxi driver cannot get enough of her.  Need to stalk.
@MissMiaKang Sexuality is based on human Psychology.   Meaning Self Confidence plays a big role in Sex.
@willripleyCNN She must be tired.
@BuckTurgidson79 Assad Syria and U.N. Economic Sanction. How can Kim Jung Un play? His life is on the line.  Kim Jung Un is not playing. But China and Russia will interfere with Korean Peninsula making peace.  That is for sure. The reason why President Trump stronger sanction on China and Russia.
@STForeignDesk Thailand Disease.  Cured??? So directly or indirectly you are encouraging that British wanker to have more dangerous sex in Thailand.  Good job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@mental_floss Do not become like South Korea News media which they cover up criminal faces.  In the end, do not help reduce criminals.
@oranckay Very smart idea for Kim.  North Korea seriously needs to focus on  Economy and Trade.  Not on Military and Missiles.
@Crimson_Rei Fair to say all South Korea ex-presidents ignored North Korea Human right issue.  The reason is 25 Million people are so brainwashed.  No idea what Human Rights means.  Plus You and all Western media should focus.  China and Russia do not have World best HUMAN RIGHT RECORD!!!!!!!
@MissMiaKang Playing God like an angel in front, on back evil as hell people.  Plenty in Hollywood.  No surprise.  Welcome to California.
@GIKorea Yes, the Smart idea for Kim Jung Un shut it all down.

@Newsweek RIP dead in Oman.   Hot humid weather or Drugs.  Not money for sure.
@oinkorea Average Korean woman needs to walk more and build more thigh muscle.  Thin leg looks very disgusting.
@MissMiaKang very sexy.
@JChengWSJ About time.  Sick and tired hearing Chinese in Korea.
@DrMarkPBarry I agree.  The reason is North Korea needs U.S.A as much South Korea.
@annafifield @JohnDelury Getting out of 70 Years Rat Hole.  In which smart idea.
@JChengWSJ One man Show.
@MissMiaKang People still use N-Word?????  STOP USING THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@AskAKorean If Kim Jung Un is smart.  He will not play " US troop removal" angle because it will never happen.
@freekorea_us Maybe it is all about your " Attitude".
@EdwardHBOh Wow,  Fascist Abe, the cat said that??? 36 years Fascist Miltary rule over Korean Peninsula was the same idea.  Only differences resources and money is what Japan only wanted and treat Koreans have second-class citizens.  " Abe Fascist Wasabi the cat".
@chadocl Sex is Universal it always sells.  North Korea no exception.
@EdwardHBOh China, Russia, ( Probably wants No U.S. Military base in South Korea).   Stupid angle for Kim Jung Un to pursue this topic with President Trump.  Good chance he will leave the discussion.
@Rmanning4 @j3nnyt0wn North Korea needs trade economy by 2020.
@DRUDGE_REPORT Try Ghetto.  Starbucks fear???????????? that is really lame.

@BuckTurgidson79 Abe the Cat.
@EdwardHBOh North Korea does have a bad track record.  That also goes with all Koreans including Korea History from Chosun Dynasty to modern-day Korea and including you.  Trust and dialogue are needed to improve and develop or set the path for better future.
@freekorea_us I clearly see China Communist Party angle plus South Korea Government policy ( North Korea refugee in Thailand, Mongolia, and Vietnam)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@FoxNews Give job toward retired military officers.

@oinkorea Yellow Sand ( Mongolia and China).  #1 Air Pollution that is harming Korean Peninsula.
@motokorich Mostly Koreans in Japan to be accurate.  If your account naturalizes and not naturalized Koreans in Japan population it would make about 1 or 2 Million populations in Japan.
@rpcward89 It means Vietnamese sandwich not meaning Anti American.
@rpcward89 Korean children never fond of Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse and the Disney Cartoon.   All Mickey Mouse clubs.
@JChengWSJ Kim Jung Un must realize.  Past is over.   He must move forward for Economic Prosperity for North Korea People.
@rpcward89 Reason why Disneyland Cartoons never been popular among Koreans.
@oinkorea What a waste of life and beauty.
@TheKoreaHerald Korean Marriage custom ( Do couples marry for love in South Korea? Answer is No. They marry for Money.  70 % for Divorce,   Do couples in South Korea have conversation? 30% do not. Reason for Divorce.)  Do Koreans cheat answer is yes. Why??? Marriage life SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

@oranckay 여보새요.
@insight_co_kr Happy Birthday, 61-year-old.   Happy Birthday.
@mpsbell Can you compare Assad Syria with Kim Jung Un North Korea???? North Korea will denuclearise.  The reason is that is Kim Jung Un only choice.

@nypost Assad ( Syria)  is a very stupid person.  British born wife WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Assad ( Syria) is a very stupid man.
@W7VOA @ISNJH @POTUS HomeWork:  Putin respond will be War or Dignity and Peace in the region.  War will happen in Isreal.

@Kelly_Macnamara @mhanham I wish them well.  I always have said.  Major War will happen in the Middle East including Israel, Iran, Turkey, Russia, and the U.S.  not Korean Peninsula.
@chadocl Kim Jung Un ( Missile Shooting and Threat) is it all worth it??? Missile angle is all wrong and mistake.  Money is Power,  Missile is Self Defence,  Missile shooting is a threat.

@freekorea_us Typo Smart.
@TheKoreaHerald Fundamentally fucked up.
@freekorea_us China is getting the mart.  China has nothing to gain with Trade War with the USA.  Reality what President Trump is doing is working for China and North Korea.
@freekorea_us @oranckay Reality hits.  Kim Jung Un thinks.
@VarietyAsia Is that picture with Donny Osmond??? Wow, picture from way back.  Korean American actor.  He was a pioneer.   RIP.
@SamanthaJPower @nytopinion Keep in Mind.  John Bolton never served Vietnam War.  A person who never served in major Wars always talks about having War.   Human basic Psychology 101.   Person need put a hand on fire to know what fire burn means.
@EdwardHBOh Not Master.  North Korea has nothing to lose compared to South Korea.  But the reality is changing fast.   Kim Jung Un knows it too well.   Kim Jung Un family and second generation will lose the most in North Korea.
@sarahkendzior Crazy Ass Jew.
@TheKoreaHerald Simply South Korea does not have " Straight Thinking and Educated" leader.  They are all corrupt.  This is what it is saying about Korea History.
@BuckTurgidson79 Probably best solution for Kim Jung Un/ regime.   Give attention to China Communism vs Japan Fascism.  Meanwhile Korean Unification only solution.
@tokyoreporter Japan has a very weak draw.  They will do better than South Korea Draw.
@yonhaptweet 중국인 짱개!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@MissMiaKang @instagram Instagram needs many improvements.   Sick of tired login verification with that fucking number code.   Email or Phone number verfication.
@oinkorea Reality is there is more mental and physical gap within North Korea people.  People in South Korea can accept them.  North Korea people have a hard time accepting the world of reality.   That is a very big fundamental gap.

McMaster departs from President Trump Administration.   What is going on with White House?  More Staff members departed from President Trump Administration than last 8 years Ex-President Obama administration.   Fundamentally wrong with Trump

@NAR Red Carpet????
@freekorea_us As long you are keeping yourself busy that is nice.   I always have thought your home away from home was South Korea.  I never thought you were stationed in South Dakota.  I visted North Dak couple of times in the past.  Nice place.
@freekorea_us Conflicting viewpoint not trying to censor. President Moon administration is Anti-War whereas President Trump administration is Pro-War. Korean Peninsula not being like the Middle East. I really cannot blame  Moon Administration being Anti-War. Did John Bolton ever serve in War?
@Drumboy44DWS @DEFCONWSALERTS Communist China and Fascist Japan are both of our enemies.
@cnni For past 70 years.
@JihyunPark7 @mpsbell I realize if you compare the Middle East with Korean Peninsula it does not blend well.  That was even before 9/11 ever happened.
@freekorea_us Ice Hockey??? or is that North??? you tell me.
@Daily_Express Fine by me.
@BuckTurgidson79 @CNNPolitics Underneath the table talks existed for past 70 years.
@Daily_Express I have never trusted North Korea News because it isn't a News.
@CNBC Buy Samsung or LG phones.   Just reality.
@freekorea_us Clearly see.  Soju time for you.
@JChengWSJ China Communist Party at work.  Reality Samsung is still top World Player.  Do you honestly trust and believe China Communist Party News media???? Do you honestly know what " Communist" run " News Media" means?????????????????????? Do not be surprised if it is complete opposite!!
@BuckTurgidson79 @SCMP_News Koreans in Japan,  Japanese in North Korea.  ( Technically all the same).  One is Mafia State and other is Fascist state.
@JBWolfsthal If John Bolton served Vietnam War.  I would not say anything but reality is John Bolton did not serve Vietnam War or any Major War.  He preaches War before Diplomacy.  He thinks and acts like War is only solution.  Hitler and all fascist leaders thought same way!!! narrow mind!!!
@boston25 Terrible.
@OhMyGOFF @jodienbc4 @nbcwashington Give us Room for Self Privacy.   No more tracking,  No more intercepts,  People should have right to have privacy inside there own house and rooms.  Including Smartphone.  We bought them, We own them.  Not Government property!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Are you serious guy??? if not.  Goodbye.
@DubstepInDPRK @freekorea_us Not sure about Moon Government trying to influence.   Moon Government is Anti-War stance vs Trump Government is Pro-War.   That is a fundamental difference between two Nation Government.
I do not describe a Negative thinking personal account.  The world needs positive mind people.
@JChengWSJ John Boloton never fought in Vietnam War matter of fact any Wars.   He wants War over Diplomacy.  Who is Maniac Kim Jung Un or John Bolton???? You tell me.
@JChengWSJ @KoreaExpose 70 years isolation,  China Communist Party,  Russia Putin,  Juche ( Kim Il Sung) ideology.  All made North Korea not the same of rest of majority of Koreans.
@NoonInKorea Truth:  Is it all about money????
@NoonInKorea South Korea Government blames Korean Americans not doing enough to promote understanding between  USA and Korea.   When was last time South Korea Government fund anything or promote anything for Korea???? Japan Government funded for 150 years toward the U.S.A. History and Culture

@mpsbell Yeah,  I though the same thing.
@annafifield Disgraced??? How about President Trump????
@motokorich Clearly shows Ex-President Park made wrong choices in life.
@mpsbell 70 years later South Korea is G20.  That picture reminds me North Korea expense of shiny shoes at the expense of the minjok or not.
@LizzieParker @JChengWSJ Accept the fact.  She was not good President.  She had wrong friends and people.
@annafifield I supported Ex-President Park Chung Hee and Stronger and better Korea and USA alliance but Ex-President Park daughter is a completely different story.  Tell you the truth.
@oinkorea Now, what Seoul needs.  Better Mayor and Systematic system.   Like it or not.  Seoul expansion is needed.  The Seoul-Incheon expansion is needed.
@allyjung I admired ana  respected Ex-President Park Chung Hee.   Daughter Park is completely different story.  Her story.  She simply met wrong friends and family.
@EdwardHBOh Having Positive mind go far ways in life even debacle six-party talks.
@JuddLegum Keep in mind.  What everything comes out from President Trump mouth does make things worse.
@julibriskman @cbcasithappens May the force be with you.  Always...............................
@TheKoreaHerald If North Korea wake up to the World of true reality.  North Korea can be a powerhouse in many fields.   25-30 Million people need to use brain wisely.
@thehill I agree 100 percent.  President Trump does not have a clean record.  President Trump past history clearly shows.
@elisewho Being pretty is important but someone is lying on the ground and needs CPR treatment who cares if it is a woman.   Trying to save a life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

@YonhapNews Smart idea for Kim Jung Un shut it down completely.   For North Korea having Nuclear Weapon is a way to end North Korea for good.  Kim Jung Un is giving all 25-30 Million North Koreans nuclear radiation.  Kim Jung Un should keep that in mind. Keeping it equals stupidity.
There are many and unqualified Korean Christian groups around the world in South Korea and the USA no exception.Deleting all negative energy giving people.  Only add Positive mind people.Sick and tired fake Korean Christians with fake Korean pride they are all demeaning losers!!!

@EdwardHBOh If you look deeper the irony is North Korea exists because of 36 years Japan Fascist Military occupation of Korean Peninsula.  Technically not because of China.
@GeographyNow Love and Peace.
@EdwardHBOh Come on.  Who says, Comrade Kim.
@allyjung To be fair-minded.  Korean woman talks too much.  Korean woman spread false rumor too much.  Korean woman major set back.
@JChengWSJ Very dirty and outdated. Transportation sucks.   All scammers.  Stores are unqualified to sell electronics.  Simply Koreans have been knowing it for many years.  Only gullible foreigners have no idea about Korea shop there.   Like Myungdong areas. etc.  Myundong needs a facelift!
@oinkorea All three probably have history doing this back in stateside.  Not first time in South Korea.
Mentally unstable President Trump very big problem.
@TheKoreaHerald South Korea has own share " Nuts and Flakes".   Keep that in mind.  The only problem here is " Korean Law and Order"  South Korea breeds criminals.
@hankookilbo Shilla and Tang ( 한국인 역사) 공부하면 대답이 있다.   중국인 조선인/한국인 뒤통 때리기.  역사 공부 합시다!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@HuffPostKorea NASA.  Just common sense.
@Robert_E_Kelly South Korea, North Korea, U.S.  way to go.   Leave out China, Russia, Japan.  President Trump mentally unstable well-known fact.  Even Japanese Prime Minister Abe early dash to President Trump regrets it.
@TheKoreaHerald @BTS_twt Love Samsung Note.
@DailyMail Stupid.
@yonhaptweet Just pretty poster boy.
Korea Times ( English Edition)  News reporter/ writer ( Oh Young Jin) world class Idiot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! His political angle is fundamentally communist.  Enough said.
@SouthKoreanew Misses expectation is nothing new in Korean Peninsula.  South Korea is full of history missing expectations.
@realDonaldTrump Good Job.  Nice.
@seanhannity America was founded by Immigrants.  Like it or not.   Just bombing themselves.
@CNNPolitics Hand padding a Cat.
@GavinHuang @JChengWSJ Samsung and LG.  But I love Samsung Note.   No words needed.
@BuckTurgidson79 Kochi City is very backward and Japanese Red Neck City.   Keep that in mind.
@KialoHQ The problem always has been Past U.S. Government administration ignoring and disrespecting North Korea.   Frank and Honest diplomacy can be very useful waking up North Korea regime.  Promise Peace over nuclear disarmament.
@RT_com We need to be level-headed with Russians.   Let's not make Russians angry.   Diplomacy and Communication are seriously needed here.
@yonhaptweet 중국 색이!!!!!!!!!!!!
@YonhapNews One crazy person.
@business @BV Italian Job!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@koreanforeigner Okay.  He is 50-50 mindset man.   70 years isolation,  70 years brainwash,  what can you really expect from the guy??? 50 Percent ear pass,  50 Percent own judgment.  Best way to deal with North Korea regime.
@PRI The picture is making me hungry.
@EdwardHBOh Two thumbs UP with Samgyupsal.   No words needed.
@martfack @WilliamPesek LMAO.
@JChengWSJ @hj257 @jjkim091 I agree.  Problem is South Korea Government and Education System.  Problem with South Korea always has been lack of system.  Simply system is outdated and backward.  The reason is South Korea Government thinks everything backward.  Like it or not " Confucious" plays big role!!!!!
@GeographyNow Love and Peace.  Happy Easter.
@GeographyNow Great T-Shirt design.
@martfack Respect:  I agree.  Not sure President Trump mentally fit.
@tokyoreporter Christ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Korea weather today very nice and cool.
@BuckTurgidson79 I hope it is true.  Kim Jung Un better keeps his promise.  If Kim Jung Un is smart probably that will be the smartest choice he ever made.
@EdwardHBOh I do not pray before I eat either but I respect and appreciate Korean food.  Whenever I visit Korean restaurant overseas it is like a home away from home.   Probably South Koreans, North Koreans,  Koreans Overseas,  Half Koreans,  Korean descents,  feel the same way as I do.
@BuckTurgidson79 It is called Kim Jung Un is sandwiched. He cannot move forward or backward.  Stuck in the middle. The reason is 70 years of Juche Ideology now and will haunt him for life.  He knows it very well.  It is all part of North Korea self-made superficial disease.  Now spreading cancer!
@EdwardHBOh In South Korea is 24 hours straight.   USB and SIM cards ( North Korea Youth) angle.  Not South Korea.  We pass that stage along time ago.
@thehill Classic.  LMAO.
@oinkorea Party is also included in South Korea celebration.  Keep that in mind.
@EdwardHBOh Do you pray to God before you eat??? I'm having Korean Cold Noodle now.  Love it.  You know what I mean???
@EdwardHBOh Tropical Fruit represents Sex and Peace.
@hankookilbo 미친 자식!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@JChengWSJ Past 70 years what has China done to prevent any War escalation ( North Korea and the West)????????????????????????
@oinkorea That is probably worse than North Korea food.   Milk with Insect.  You must be insane.  The reason why American cereals doing so well in Korea.  It is eatable.  One more advice.  Dogmeat,  Catmeat, and Insects cause Leukemia Cancer.  Keep that in mind when you adventure out!!!!!!
@chadocl Snow.   Nice.   Whats happening to Seoul.  You should ask.
@EdwardHBOh You never had Korean Cold Noodle???  Food is Food.  If you are hungry.  You will eat it.
@ZororoMakamba @willripleyCNN The right place for you.  See you soon.
@JChengWSJ Hope and Learn.
@SBS8news 짱개 놈들!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@cnni Power of KPOP.  Enough said.
@tokyoreporter 40 year old has become " broiled squid".
@TheKoreaHerald Power of KPOP.  Enough said.   Much better than Movies and TV Drama.
@LPGA @Thejessicakorda @ANAinspiration Nice shot.
@samkimasia Power of KPOP says it all.  Much better than Drama and Movies.
@EdwardHBOh Korean Peninsula always had North and South border from Parhae and Shilla Dynasty.  Like the State of California is divided between Norte and Suenos.
@JChengWSJ Who is that guy clapping??? Do not tell me it is Korean Dennis Rodman.
@VICE Cat and Parrot depending on the pet owner.  Even pets look creepy.
@angryasianman Meaning he Sucks Shit or Good Shit???
@EdwardHBOh I know it was a joke.  Kim Jung Un looks like Sumo wrestler.  I really feel sorry for his wife in bed with him or after he used his bathroom.  I can imagine after he walks out of his room.  She would be squirting the perfume all over that dame place to smell better.
@jakeadelstein @Noahpinion @WilliamPesek Yakuza will love it.
@josungkim @bowden_jayden I never knew he actually works for North Korea people or has a work schedule.  If he honestly worked.  He won't be fat.
@martyn_williams They all can be Koreans living in China ( aka Pro-North Korea).
@cnni @CNNStyle Crazy.  Takes up way too many spaces.
@LPGA @TheJenniferSong @ANAinspiration Nice Job.
@insight_co_kr Creepy Stalking Movie.................
@EdwardHBOh You mean " Tree Nuclear Radiation Soup".   People living in North Korea have radiation.  So Kim Jung Un gave their own people death ticket wish.  Only saddest part people inside North Korea have no idea.
@EdwardHBOh Can you tell difference between malnourished with someone being overweight??? I guess not.
@eodgeek Crazy...............
@nktpnd That Dumpling Galaxy coming down about right now back to earth.  Be prepared.
@chloekimsnow Love your Positive mind attitude.  Life is too short to fight with Lunatics.
@motokorich @annafifield Love Mask.  Why????????????
@EdwardHBOh Only thing I can say is they sang " Bad Boy".  I think he liked it.
@SBS8news 짱개 놈.
@JChengWSJ Hyundai seriously needs fresh mind leadership.   A couple of years now.   Leadership has been lagging.
@willripleyCNN Will,  what happen to North Korea???  You switch from Tokyo to Hong Kong.  See you soon.
@EdwardHBOh Three Generation Punishment.  Only find it in Korean Culture or Korean Peninsula.  In the Real world.  We call it Law and Order.  In which Korea does not have.
@NAR New Balance or Nike.
@cnni @ELINTNews ChinaTown!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@tictoc ChinaTown!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@thehill Rambo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@yonhaptweet Young Pretty age.
@minseon_ku Is Yonhap News media accurate????  Not sure.  Korean News reporter uses Balance Perspective when they write news.   Often times I find the news very bias or one-sided.  Leaning it wrong ways.  Not Balance ways.
@djjkim are you from Alaska??? Come on. You can say it.
@yonhaptweet 곤대 문화 대문내 대한민국 사회 와 교육이 큰 문재다!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@STopinion @STcom Abe bending over.
@KBSnews 중국 색이 아닌지..............................
@planetlabs Landing on the U.S.   I wish you all the luck.
@djjkim New York Magazine has much more classic front page.  I laughed so hard.
@minseon_ku Kim Jong Il???? his late deceased father???? Red Velvet sang Bad Boy afterall.................. Good Job.
@FT HTC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! aka Hallow Taiwan Company!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@HuffPostKorea Power of KPOP.
@NYMag @jonathanchait LMAO.  CLASSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@TheJihyeLee @RVsmtown Clearly shows Music is Univeral for Love and Peace.
@JChengWSJ I guess Red Velvet sang Bad Boy after all.
@elisewho Red Velvet and Cho Young Pil in Front with the Man.
@EdwardHBOh @MintaroOba Youtube ( Social Blade) ranking it is C+.
@motokorich Red Velvet sang Bad Boy in front Kim Jung Un.  The reaction would be......... a cough from Kim Jung Un or Clap??? we have to wait and see.
@ForeignAffairs The Problem is with how he's going about it. ( Fundamental Problem) for President Trump on East Asia ( Inconsistent) Policy toward Korean Peninsula, China, and Japan. Giving mixed blackmail message to South Korea is biggest mistake and worry. Diplomacy simply do not make mistakes
@MetroUK Celebrating and Worshipping Korean Penis God.
@tokyoreporter Like Japanese Porno.
@EdwardHBOh Soju ( Rice Wine) it is cheapest and healthy drink for Koreans.  Great with Korean food.  Soju drink is great for Korean Winter Season.  All time best.  When the weather is hot and humid drinking Makgalli or Beer is great too.
@business It all comes down to Engine Power, Comfort, and Safety.
@TheKoreaHerald I thought Dog Meat, Snake, was bad.  Insect cereal with milk ( disgusting).  Eating Wild animals meats will get you killed including insects ( Leukemia Cancer).
@TIME Taco Bell is much better for you.
