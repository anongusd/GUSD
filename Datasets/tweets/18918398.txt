Why band? If banded ospreys are found again, we can track their migration, health and causes of mortality. Our osprey propagation program started in the late 1980s and now boasts 20 nesting platforms throughout the county.
Check out this short video documenting one of our annual summer rituals: osprey banding. @FPDCC Wildlife staff members measure and weigh the chicks, draw blood and check them for overall signs of health. Each chick gets an aluminum band with a unique identifier. https://t.co/ViXTHZRsc5

@pinkdorsey Coyotes may have several den sites and may move out of your property without you doing anything. They'll also move on once the pups are old enough.
@pinkdorsey If the coyotes are not acting aggressively, it's best to leave them alone. You can contact Cook County Animal and Rabies Control for advice. But if there is no conflict and you simply don't want them on the property you would need to hire a licensed wildlife trapper.
@pinkdorsey You can email fpdcc.info@cookcountyil.gov and we can pass it along to our biologists.
@pinkdorsey If it is in Cook County, you can contact us to potentially investigate the den as part of the Project.
@pinkdorsey The best approach is to leave it alone and make sure that pets are kept secure and out of the area. If the adult coyotes are acting aggressively you can reach out to your local animal control agency. Check the "When Should I be Concerned" section: https://t.co/yjwg8kXZWh

@stevevance @bingaman To clarify: "They" is multiple people over last 3yrs working on Google Maps product.
@stevevance @bingaman They told us Nature Preserves are intentionally grey (so we recategorized as parks). Over last year chunks disappear w/out change to data.

@windy_city_10 And if you missed it, there is an existing water fountain at the bathroom off the parking lot at Irene Hernandez where you took your photo.
@windy_city_10 We do install fountains when it makes sense -- example: at Harms Woods North we put in a new prefabricated bathroom &amp; included a fountain
@windy_city_10 Both are expensive (&amp; sometimes destructive). Once installed, repairing damage from vandalism, maintenance, winterizing, etc… adds up
@windy_city_10 Because our sites are mostly remote, installing a water fountain or pump involves either tapping into municipal water or digging a well.
