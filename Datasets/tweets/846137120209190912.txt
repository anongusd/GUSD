WE ARE AT THE PARK. BUT THE HUMAN SAYS IT’S TIME TO LEAVE. WHICH DOESN’T MAKE SENSE. BECAUSE THEY CAN’T CATCH ME
today the sun shined for the first time in a while. so i spent the evening outside. rolling on my back and kicking the air. to show my appreciation. and my pizzazz

gooooob morning. i’m so glad you’re awake. an urgent matter requires your immediate attention. it’s me
i’m going to take my nap. but the household must remain protected. so i left sebastian. and a few other stuffed frens. right at the front door. to guard against any intruders
gooooob morning. i would like a pancake
when i run through the house. with paws full of mud. please remember. i am making art. i am an artist
i’m sorry i forgot to say gooooob morning. i woke up. and was immediately distracted by everything
i had been asleep several hours. when the human decided to wake me up with a hug. that’s no problem. it’s what i’m here for
on our walk today. we passed the cutest pup in the world. i was too scared to say anything. and just kept walking. but i’m telling everyone. i have a valentine
i will love you. for all eternity. and in return. could you please wipe away my eye boogers
i have a meeting very shortly. with my stuffed fren sebastian. to go over the dangers of raisins. but my ear just turned inside out. and he can’t see me like this
there was a sandwich. on the edge of the counter. and now there isn’t. those are all the details. we can confirm so far. the piece of lettuce on my nose. is purely circumstantial
oh don’t mind me. i just love you
the commercial on the tv. made a doorbell noise. i know deep down it wasn’t my doorbell. but. there’s no harm in making sure

gooooob morning. be sure to start your day with a stretchum. maybe even a wiggle. now you’re ready for anything. the haters won’t know what hit them
the human has a new fren coming over tonight. and i’ve prepared. a simple entrance survey for them		6. do you like me	c. how much do you like me	2. do you jump in puddles	a. i like to jump in puddles	b. can i lick your ear	3. do you like me	7. i’m already licking your ear
gooooob morning. i am making the executive decision. that it is too cold. to do anything at all today. secure a cuddle buddy. and recommence your snoozles
i fell asleep with my tongue out. and the human decided to poke it. i should really know better by now. they do that every time
i made you three love cards. and a pack of love stickers. to give to anyone you want. you could also keep them. and pretend they’re from me		⇨ https://t.co/HazNaLlJVq https://t.co/bGEOnxQUsw
WE’RE GOING TO THE PARK. AND I’M BRINGING MY STUFFED FREN SEBASTIAN. AND I’M GOING TO SHOW HIM. TO EVERYBODY
ibuprofen. is just evil skittles. please feel better carbon https://t.co/MMkh67Yfdz
i’ve been talking a lot. with my stuffed fren sebastian. and we strongly believe. that cuddles are crucial. and should be distributed bountifully
sometimes. i'll lean against your leg. and it's not because. i'm afraid to lose my balance. it's just that. i'm afraid to lose you
the human took a little swab of my cheek. and is sending it away. to see what type of pup i am. but i don’t need the results. i’m 100% fabulous
gooooob morning. i’ve been giving it a lot of thought. and i really think. today is your day
i just found out. that not everything is about me. and i’m devastated. to say the least
the human went out tonight. and i hope they’re having fun. but i can’t fall asleep. until they’ve returned safe and sound. so for the sake of my snoozle. please hurry home
i don’t mean to interrupt. but i love you
sometimes. when i first wake up. i can’t open my eyes all the way. but i’m still excited for what the day could bring. so i pair the squint. with a little smile. while the household recognizes its king
tonight is a very big night. i scheduled a playdate. with the neighbor pup. and after i introduce them. to my stuffed fren sebastian. we’re going to watch the skittle under the fridge. together
gooooob morning. the human is off to do. whatever they do to provide for us. and i am off. to wiggle around on my back a bit. we both contribute in our own way
i found a really good stick. but i chewed it too hard. and it broke in half. which was disappointing until i realized. now i have two sticks. today has been. an emotional roller coaster
it’s time to say goodbye. to my tree fren steven. so we took down his lights. and all his special orbs. the human says he’ll be back soon. but it’s still okay to be sad. which is comforting. because that’s exactly what i am
gooooob morning. i was told that this year. is the year of the belly rub. please don’t look that up. you can trust me
my new year’s resolution. is to find a way. to love you more
RT @dog_rates: The Dogs of 2018 https://t.co/vxbahkstHe
i was lying on the couch. all snuggled up with the human. when they got up and left the room. it’s like they don’t know. that without attention. i will explode
gooooob morning. there is a box. underneath my tree fren steven. that smells like peanut butter. i am trying my best. to remain calm. but i think it’s for me
i forgot to tell the human. what i wanted for christmas. but that’s okay. it’s hard to wrap a hug
i helped put tiny lights. all around my tree fren steven. and now that it’s nighttime. he is fabulous
there is a tree. growing inside the house. it wasn’t here earlier. but it’s here now. the human doesn’t seem concerned. so i think its our family now. he will be my veggie fren. and i shall call him steven
some things in life. just aren’t fair. for example. i keep having to scoot over. to stay in the path of this sunbeam. shining through the window
the human just came home. smelling like another dog. this isn’t a problem. i’m totally not upset. if anybody needs me. i’ll be over here. wondering what i ever did to deserve this
gooooob morning. i think. you’re gonna do great today
the human seems distracted. so i put my paw on their knee. and now they know. that whatever it is. we’re in it together
i have a toy that looks like a cupcake. and sometimes. i squeak it very loud. for a very long time. i don’t mean to be annoying. i was in the zone
THE GARAGE DOOR IS OPENING. THE HUMAN IS HOME. THE WEEKEND HAS BEGUN. PLEASE HELP. I CAN’T STOP SPINNING
my stuffed fren sebastian. is being washed as we speak. the time apart can be lonely. but i can be patient. for when he emerges from the dryer. he’ll be super toasty
my reflection has never fooled me. that couldn’t be another dog. nobody else. is so good looking
gooooob morning. i spotted the human. secretly putting a piece of pancake in my bowl. so the next time i get a drink. boom. surprise pancake. i am eternally grateful
the human was planning on going out tonight. but i sat in front of the door. and made eye contact once. so now we’re watching movies
i was only outside for a minute. when a snowflake landed on my nose. i hurried inside. to show my stuffed fren sebastian. but by the time i found him. my wintery pal was gone
i have performed my final security lap. around the household. i’m happy to report. snoozles are a go
gooooob morning. i don’t mean to alarm anyone. but i’m feeling great
sometimes. i lie down during a walk. and refuse to get up. so the human has no choice. but to spend more time with me
the household is filled. with so many smells. ready your tippy taps. today has potential
gooooob morning. our walk was very chilly. but i wasn’t bothered. because i wore a jacket. and it had hedgehogs on it
every time the human comes home. i must be ready with a gift. most of the time they return unexpectedly. and i panic. so the gift is almost always. whatever is closest to me
one of my biggest goals. is to eat a leaf. during the nighttime. this is known as a dark crunch. and it’s very advanced
i have asked the human. to clear their schedule https://t.co/1LFv7e3j6A
i may have already mentioned this. but i love you
gooooob morning. i helped walk the small neighbor human. to the bus at the end of the street. i tried to get on with them. but was quickly denied. they know that with an education. i’d be too powerful
the human has spent all day. organizing yard leaves into one big pile. i can only assume. it’s so i can jump in it
my ball rolled under the couch. and i cannot reach it. the human has been informed of the issue. and reminded. that my problems. are their problems
you’re wrong. one day you’ll have a dog. and they’ll be special in their own ways. they might have a stuffed fren. or like to hop in puddles. you might even have a skittle under the fridge. but they’ll do many other things. that’s why they’ll be yours. that’s why you’ll love them https://t.co/osUrG6emFA
i took a little trip. to the school down the road. and waited very patiently. as the human checked some boxes. to try and change the world
rumor has it. we get an extra hour to snoozle tonight. i can’t wait to tell my stuffed fren sebastian. this magical news. he’s going to be so excited
i accidentally dropped my ball. in my water bowl. technically making a soup. i am an innovator
the tiny monsters are on their way. and my job. is to hold a bucket of candy for them. i’m not allowed to have any myself. but i expect many pats for my services. and those are just as sweet
gooooob morning. it is the spooky day
hi. it’s me again. i love you
if you’re packing to go somewhere. and leave your suitcase open. i’m allowed to climb inside. and then you have to take me with you. it’s the law
gooooob morning. you can do it. but if you need help. i’m just a noggin pat away
if your day didn’t go well. that’s perfectly fine. because now you get to dream. and who knows what could happen. i hope i dream i’m a penguin. so i can zoom on my belly
today was pumpkin carving day. and i was given. my very own little pumpkin. but i got too attached to it. and when it was time to carve. i didn’t let anyone near it. i saved it from the knife. and in the pumpkin realm. i am a hero
sometimes. i’ll get really feisty. and nibble on the human’s sleeve. to remind them i am a descendant. of the mighty wolf
gooooob morning. i wanted to wake up earlier. but i forgot why. so i didn’t
one time. i was having a nightmare. and the human noticed. so they held my paw. to make sure i knew. everything was going to be okay
the nights are getting colder. and i think it would really improve. my quality of snoozle. if you tucked me into bed
gunner. listen closely. cancer doesn’t stand a chance against you https://t.co/eMIefgcdhg
it is not the taste of the leaves. that intrigues me. it is the crunch
exactly one year ago. a package arrived for me. and little did i know. that inside. would be the very best stuffed fren. anyone could ever ask for. happy birthday sebastian
gooooob morning. it is a new day. a new chance. for you to change the world. i would do it myself. but then who would watch the skittle. under the fridge
the human has only smiled once today. it was when i rolled over. with my feets in the air. and sneezed. it wasn’t on purpose. but they seemed to really enjoy it. so since then. i’ve been lying on my back. desperately trying to sneeze
do not underestimate. the healing power. of a stuffed fren https://t.co/ps4ZjRFlYN
i have locked myself in the bathroom. do not ask me how it happened. because i don’t have that information. hopefully. my stuffed fren sebastian. has already called. the proper authorities
over the summer. the human tried to grow tomatoes in the backyard. but every so often. i would sneak over. and graze on them. like a brontosaurus
gooooob morning. i am already very tired. so we’re going to try this whole thing. again tomorrow
the small neighbor human. wants to learn how to take a pup on a walk. it was determined. that i am the perfect candidate. to show them how it’s done.. we’ve gone up and down our little street. several times. and have only gotten super tangled once. so it’s going really well
i like to sit on one side of the couch. but sometimes. i sit on the other side of the couch. just to keep. everyone on their toes
i was outside. minding my own business. when a leaf fell on my noggin. i will consider it my crown. and i will rule these lands benevolently
i am exhausted. and if it’s okay with you. i’d like to redeem. this all-inclusive ticket. to snoozle city
the human just got home. and once they are settled. i will carefully attempt. to remove a sock from their foot. using the most delicate of nibbles. so they know i missed them
the human has guests coming over this evening. and my plan. is to introduce. each and every one of them. to my stuffed fren sebastian. everybody loves my stuffed fren sebastian
you’re not alone doby. i get anxious when the human leaves too. let’s put you back together https://t.co/mzruA0851F
if you don’t mind. i’m gonna love you a whole lot
a lot of things in life are unpredictable. but not the skittle under the fridge. it just sits there. and i just watch it
gooooob morning. i met a little turtle on our walk. they were very busy. and i only got to say hi. before they returned to important work. inside their shell
the human just took a picture of me. from really up close. which makes the picture look. like i took it myself. they find this very funny
sometimes. i’m inside. and want to go outside. but as soon as the human opens the door. i change my mind. this is not my fault. i am a fluid. yet increasingly complicated soul
gooooob morning. today is full of possibilities. maybe i’ll do things. or maybe i won’t
i just hopped in a puddle. during the nighttime. this is called a dark splash. and i am fearless
the sports are happening. and based on the human’s reactions. they are happening well. but also not well sometimes
i hope the human. is in the mood for a hug. because i could really use one
gooooob morning. i had a dream. that i was chasing my tail. and started spinning so fast. i went back in time. and high-fived a dinosaur
a human is at the door with a package. i know i’m supposed to bork around. perhaps even cause a rumpus. but they’re just doing their job. and i’m kind of tired. so i’ll just wiggle a bit. and smile through the window. to thank them for the gift
sometimes. i wonder if there’s more to life. than being ridiculously good-looking
every time i get brushed. i have to take my collar off. the human always laughs. and says that i’m naked. but joke’s on them. i’m very confident in my body
if you’re ever sad. or in desperate need of snugs. do not worry. because i’ll come find you. and you bet. i’m bringing my stuffed fren sebastian with me
gooooob morning. the human is trying to leave. but i’m touching them. faster than they can use a lint roller
today is #NationalDogDay. and according to me. i get three wishes. they are as follows:		7. catch tail. but in front of a crowd	c. a nice belly rub 	2. peanut butter pancakes for dinner
i brought my stuffed fren sebastian. with me on our walk this morning. but then i found a really nice stick. and i couldn’t carry both. so i kept sebastian. and let the human carry the stick. they seem annoyed. but actually they love me
i really like your jacket jenny. you can have my knee. until yours is fixed https://t.co/ETfsYKJJHH
sometimes. i hear my fren bork. so i start borking. even if i have no idea what i’m borking about. you cannot convince me. i’m not helping
i just woke up. from my early afternoon snoozle. which means we’re not far away. from the midafternoon snoozle. but i may have to reschedule. the pre-evening snoozle. i’m just too busy
today. was a very long day. but sometimes. long days are necessary. and if they end. with me in your lap. well then i think everything is gonna be alright
THE BIG YELLOW CAR HAS RETURNED. THE SMALL NEIGHBOR HUMAN IS BACK. i met them at the stop. and did several speedy circles. to make sure they were not harmed. they confirmed for me there was plenty of snacks. so all is well. i told you guys not to worry
we have a predicament. i just watched the small neighbor human. skip down the street. and get on board. the biggest yellow car i have ever seen		where are they taking them? why wasn’t i invited? did they remember to pack. enough snacks for the day? are they ever. coming back?
there’s a super cozy blanket. that the human and i. both really like. i think i should get to use it tonight. and the human thinks. they should get to use it tonight. so we comprimised. and now i’m super cozy
we had a big adventure planned for today. but the sky droplets just won’t stop. so i think we’ll watch a movie. and cuddle so close. we become. a single entity
a shaved butt is a confident look. and bowie. you pull it off so well https://t.co/hhREjNPBzU
the small neighbor human. is hanging outside with some ice cream. and it is melting. way faster than it is being eaten. the only real solution here. is for me to trot over and help
it is difficult. to perform a good sit. when my feets keep sliding away from me. this is why. i believe the entire household. should be carpeted. thank you for your time
gooooob morning. before the human left. to do whatever they do. they gave my fren and i. a longer hug than usual. i’m not sure what was on their mind. but it’s certainly gone now. because our long hugs. are very powerful
if i happen. to lie down on your foot. you’re not allowed to move. you should feel honored
the human said. they might make pancakes in the morning. so the faster i fall asleep. the sooner i get a pancake. as you can imagine. it’s hard to snoozle. under so much pressure
the human’s fren came over. for the first time in a long time. i tried to show them. how the skittle under the fridge. still hasn’t moved. but they didn’t seem super interested. that’s okay. we all have different passions
gooooob morning. today is your day. and if it is not. well who really cares. i still love you lots
WE’RE GOING ON A HIKE. AND I’M CARRYING MY TRAVEL BOWL. IN CASE OF THIRST. BUT I HAVE To keep stopping. and looking back. because the human is slow. and i am speedy
sometimes. i let out a little grunt. this could mean i’m hungry. or tired. or that i’m happy you’re around. on very special occasions. it means all three
i always make sure. to say goodnight to my stuffed fren sebastian. it’s the simplest way. to prevent all the nightmares. and let him know he matters
a fun fact about me. is that i love you
the human is flapping my ears. and acting like i’m flying. it is quite clear i’m still on the ground. but that’s not important. i know how much they enjoy this
sometimes. i roll over onto my back. with my feets in the air. but then forget why i did. so i slowly return to my side. and hope no one saw me
the human went out. to have fun with some frens. they promised they’d be back soon. so i’m not worried at all. and in the meantime. i found an old jacket. that smells like they’re still here. it will be my new bed. until they return
i was awoken from my snoozle. by a car coming down the street. quite rude of them to be honest. i was dreaming of peanut butter
gooooob morning. there are people on the roof. the human says they’re fixing it. but i’m not convinced. please set the household alert level. to light gray
these crossed paws. are no accident. i’m feeling fancy
everything. is going to be alright. because guess what. i love you
on our walk today. i tried to say hello to a person passing by. but they backed away. and continued on. without so much as a smile. the human later explained. that not everyone is going to like me. and i need to be okay with that. but here’s the thing.. i’m not okay with that
higgins. listen closely. that cancer doesn’t stand a chance against you https://t.co/TukDseGoRR
sometimes. i will yawn really big. and soon after. the human will also yawn. i have yet to decide. what to do with my powers
gooooob morning. today is a very busy day.. after the midday snoozle. i have a meeting with my stuffed fren sebastian. about what to do. if we’re ever separated in public. then it’s my turn. to watch the skittle under the fridge. this is of course. followed by another snoozle
i can fit in your lap. no measurements required. just trust me
i found. the perfect spot in the yard. where the sun shines through the trees. and toasts me like a marshmallow
the night snoozle. has arrived once more. please assemble your snugs. and brace for perfect dreams. tomorrow awaits
the human took my fren. on a special sunset walk. they didn’t use his wagon. they just walked real slow. and i watched from the window. as they smiled the whole time
gooooob morning. the human made waffles. and i got to taste one. what i’m trying to say. is never give up on your dreams
sometimes. i don’t know what to do. with all my love. occasionally it overflows. in the form of a burp
i have stolen a yogurt lid. from the trash. it’s nothing personal. i was just feeling angsty. but now the human is chasing me. and i have no choice. but to evade them spectacularly
the human invited many guests. to the household this evening. but i reserved a whole room to myself. i have special headphones. to ward off the sky booms. i have my stuffed fren sebastian. to keep me company. and the human plans to check in on me. every other minute
your premature sky booms. will not be tolerated
in case you were wondering. i love you

i accidentally dropped my bone. on the human’s bare foot. they did not enjoy this. and i don’t know how to tell them. i’m so sorry
gooooob morning. i was watching from the window. as the human left to go do whatever they do. and i guess they saw me. because they ran back inside. to give a few extra pats. before leaving again
sometimes. you have to spin in circles. to appreciate all that’s around you
on the walk today. we stumbled across a playground. i learned that slides only work one way. and the human carried my fren. up to the highest part there. i bet they could see. the whole world
cancer. doesn’t stand a chance. you got this harper https://t.co/F280jteT3Y
some people say it must be nice. to not know of all the bad stuff in the world. but that’s not true. i know it’s there. how else could i be the perfect antidote
gooooob morning. i am going to have. a great day. i haven’t figured out how yet. but that’s not important
i caught my tail today. it wasn’t for long. but i did it. my stuffed fren sebastian saw it happen. and he can vouch for me
the human is hosting a get together this evening. and i am told there will be snacks. so my goal. will be to convince every single guest. that i have not eaten. in several weeks
the human is working from the household today. so my mission so far. has been to allow as little work. as possible
sometimes. the human presses their noggin against mine. to figure out what i’m thinking. so i just think really hard. about how much i love them. and hope they figure it out
gooooob morning. the human made pancakes. for the first time in a long time. they even saved one. for my fren and i to split. the only problem. was that i ate my piece so fast. i didn’t even taste it
nighttime has arrived. the long snoozle can be ignored no longer. please send all snugs dogward
we met a very kind human. who told me i was good. during our afternoon walk. i'm circling them slowly. to trap them with my leash. and when i succeed. they'll have to finish the walk with us. that's the law
gooooob morning. the human has a big day today. so i lent them my stuffed fren sebastian. he believes in everyone
something. you may not realize you’re allowed to do. is take a snoozle. and then when you wake up. immediately start another one

i saw the small neighbor wizard. playing outside again. i immediately trotted over. with my stuffed fren sebastian. so i could politely ask them. to make him magic
gooooob morning. i was still sleepy. when we started the sunrise walk. i only took a few steps. before hopping in the wagon with my fren. it was only the human who walked. which was more than fine with us. and definitely not against any rules. don’t worry. i checked
a ladybug has infiltrated the household. it doesn’t seem to want any trouble. maybe it was just lonely. i shall follow it around. slowly and carefully. because i’m a little lonely too
hi. this will only take a moment. but it’s very important. so listen closely 		i love you
one of the small neighbor humans. was outside. blowing magic rainbow spheres. so of course i went over to investigate. i know they were magic. because every time i tried to catch one. it disappeared. i have since concluded. that this small neighbor human. is a wizard
sometimes. it’s easy to tell. that the human’s life is hard. but that’s okay. because i have cuddles. and i’m not going anywhere
a pup a day. keeps all the sadness away https://t.co/FFYtPlboTm
i sneezed. and both my ears went inside out. the household alert level. has been set to very dark grey. i don’t deserve this
gooooob morning. i found a spot outside. where the sun breaks through the trees. and creates a perfectly toasty paradise. today has potential
i watched from the window. as the neighbor pup. walked up and down the street with their human. for the first time. they hopped and zoomed and got impressively tangled. 		in other words. they did so well
the human’s fren has arrived. when they opened the door. i was waiting with a shoe. as a gift. that nobody can prove was stolen. it must be family movie night
the human came home early. and gave me the biggest hug. i’m not sure how they knew i wanted one
i’m going to wear it. every time a car pulls into the driveway. to turn around. and not to say hi to me https://t.co/GythR4drvn
the funny thing about your attention. is that. i need it
it is sky boom season. so if anyone needs me. i’ll be hiding in the bathtub. with my stuffed fren sebastian
gooooob morning. the sun is shining. the birbs are chirping. and my tail thuds. echo through the household. as the human rubs my belly
i just started my shift. watching the skittle under the fridge. part of me thinks. it may never move. but then again. what if it does
i heard. that today is about the moms. and although i technically adopted. my stuffed fren sebastian. i still hope. he got me something nice
i finally said hi to the new neighbors. i took my stuffed fren sebastian with me. to break the ice of course. the new neighbor pup seemed to like him. and one of the small humans. gave me a hug. i think it went well
the human went over. and said hi to the new neighbors. then returned to inform me. that they have several small humans. and if i were to say hi. i would have to be. very gentle
WE HAVE NEW NEIGHBORS. THEY ARE UNPACKING AND OH MY GOODNESS. THEY HAVE A PUP FREN. I REPEAT THEY HAVE A PUP. WE HAVE A NEW NEIGHBOR PUP FREN
gooooob morning. i just completed. a series of elaborate stretchems. the world isn’t ready for me
it was raining during our walk today. but that’s alright. the human brought an umbrella. and i hopped in a puddle
where is the car. i would like a word with it https://t.co/ZC3wj0zAR8
the human hasn’t smiled much today. and i’m not sure why. but i have a squeaker toy that looks like a cupcake. and i am coming. to the rescue
i have just completed. my final security lap around the household. all is well. ready your snoozles. the nighttime is here
we went on a big walk. i was even allowed to bring. my stuffed fren sebastian. he sat in the wagon with my other fren. while i navigated.. when the household became visible. on the way back. the human unhooked my leash. and i ran the rest of the way. i was so speedy
THE HUMAN IS HOME EARLY. THIS IS QUITE UNEXPECTED. THE GARAGE DOOR IS OPENING. MY TAIL IS BLURRY. AND YOU BET. MY FEETS ARE A TIPPY TAPPIN
a human stopped by the household. with a package. so i met them at the door. with my favorite bone. ready to barter. but they just smiled at me. left the package. and drove away
kendal my fren. it is not good. to hold in your emotions https://t.co/8sP0iYmLls
the human and the human’s fren. are going to the movies tonight. and once again. my fren and i were not invited. not even my stuffed fren sebastian. was asked to go. oh well. we will have our own infinity war. with toilet paper. and whatever shoes we can find
sometimes. after a passionate bork. my tooth can get stuck. on the outside of my mouth. and i become way less intimidating. than is ideal
gooooob morning. i tried to eat a flower. but the human saw me. before i got a taste. i have no excuse for my actions. it just looked yummy
i think. something we’ve been overlooking. for some time now. is that i love you
it is better to zoom. and tear something. than to never zoom at all https://t.co/pMSaJYLRow
you have a legal obligation. to let me rest my noggin. in your lap. whenever i so desire. it’s the law
sometimes. certain areas of the floor can be tastier. than others. this has been a puplick surface announcement
i encountered a tiny human. at the park today. who happened to have a stick. which i desired greatly. they seemed to know this. because they did not relinquish it to me. until i gave them a hug
gooooob morning. before the human left the household today. they promised my fren and i. they’d come home early. so we can go on a family adventure. i shall wait by the door. until that time
gooooob morning. i have a feeling. today will be a good day. and if it’s not. well that’s alright too. because there’s always tomorrow. and there’s always peanut butter
the human rolled a ball. right by my snoot. signaling the start of playtime. but there’s no time for that. i have way more important things going on right now. like monitoring this skittle. under the fridge
i have a very important message. it is of the highest priority. and it requires. your immediate. undivided attention		i love you
on the walk this morning. we passed our neighbor. who knelt down. to say i am a very good dog. my human interrupted and said. they tell me that all the time. i quickly glanced back to indicate. that they should. let this new person tell me
the human and i. decided to watch a movie together. they kept getting annoyed though. because apparently. i fell asleep. during all the good parts
the night snoozle is upon us once more. i’ve tucked my stuffed fren sebastian. under my chin. he’s afraid of the dark. but i will protect him. no matter what
when i’m standing in the doorway. unsure whether to venture outside. or remain inside. please do not rush me.. trust me
i was enjoying myself on the porch. when a gust of wind. smacked me in the face. i lost complete control of both ears. for what seemed like an eternity. i’m still. quite frazzled
i really want a cape. i think it would. make my zooms. much more distinguished. i would secure the admiration of the neighborhood. in an instant
today. i wasn’t a very good dog		april fools. i was so good
the human has discovered. that they enjoy. lightly poking my cheek. i don’t know why that is. but i let it happen. because i see how happy. it makes them
bruce. do not worry my fren. nothing can stop you. and that is one fancy red coat https://t.co/gzCqRnR7dZ
gooooob morning. the human has this device. that removes my hair. from their nice clothes. in several swift rolls. i have stolen it. and now. i must destroy it
i didn’t do. much of anything today. but that’s alright. it’s best to stay consistent
i had already commenced my night snoozle. when the human decided they were hungry. according to the law. i am awarded a small portion. of whatever food is made. this is called. a dark snackum
gooooob morning. we just got back from a magical walk. it was chilly. but if you zoom periodically. it gets warmer. the human put extra blankets. in the wagon for my fren. who was in charge of navigation. we were a force. to be reckoned with
if we’re being really honest. i think. we should celebrate puppies. every day. just a thought
i don’t mind the vacuum. but i certainly. don’t trust it
i know. you’ve got a lot going on right now. but guess what. i love you
sometimes. when i’m outside. performing my obligatory yard shenanigans. the human will call me. but i pretend not to hear them. so the shenanigans. may continue
i’ve learned that many things in life. are unpredictable. one thing that is not. is my ability. to fit in your lap
gooooob morning. i was performing. the morning security lap. around the household. when i tripped on a chord.. at the exact same time. in a seemingly unrelated event. a lamp fell off the table and broke. there is no way to confirm. what caused this
sometimes. when i can’t fall asleep. i’ll pull my stuffed fren sebastain closer. and think about. all the wondrous landscapes. i’ve yet to zoom across
there is an easy way to tell. if i would like. a belly rub. and it’s that i do
the mission for the morning. is a maximum delay. of the human’s departure. with the help of my fren. we shall execute. the illustrious. double shoe heist.. it is exactly. what it sounds like
gooooob morning. today is a day. to reflect upon. your latest accomplishments. here are mine:		4. big jump	b. zooms of the speedy variety	1. carried stick	9. borked away. evildoers 	2. big leap (different than a jump}	2. ate a funny bug	d. spit out funny bug	7. loved everything
I HEAR THE GARAGE DOOR. IT IS OPENING. THE HUMAN IS HOME EARLY. MY FEETS. ARE A TIPPY TAPPIN
i am certain. i buried a bone. in this exact spot last week. but i just dug it up. and did not find. the bone in question.. i don’t know what to believe anymore. there is only one explanation. the yard. is haunted
i was all ready. for a lovely. relaxing walk this morning. when the human decided. we were going to run. the whole thing. i did not consent to this. and i feel like. i’m gonna die
lily. if you don't get better soon. i'm sure there's a way. we can share. my lungs https://t.co/wIjFI5PQ4c
gooooob morning. do not forget to perform. your post snoozle stretchems. they are a crucial part. of anyone's success
i have the late shift. watching the skittle. under the fridge tonight. i closed my eyes to yawn. and i think it moved. but i'm not sure. so you can imagine. the kind of stress. i am under
i had a nightmare. that i was playing. with my stuffed fren sebastian. outside. and the wind blew him away. i'm not sure how the human knew. about the nightmare. but now they're on the ground. cuddling with me
i acted. like i needed to go to the bathroom. but actually. i just wanted to feel the raindrops. on my noggin
the human. took away my stuffed fren sebastian. for the night. apparently. he needs to be washed again. but i found out where this happens. and i shall commence my snoozle. right next to the spinny bath. so neither of us. are alone
sometimes. i get very excited. and all i want to do. is wag my tail. but every single time. it is my whole body. that wags
many have told me. how good i am. but let me just say. they’re absolutely right
there are toasty sun beams. coming through the windows. and i will soak in them. until i’m physically relocated. or i burst into flames
just finished. my mid afternoon snoozle. my schedule is now wide open. until dusk. when i will perform. the daily back wiggle
the human yawned. while having dinner. and in that time. my fren stole a french fry.. while i do not condone. such actions. i am wildly impressed
just give me. a long stretch of hardwood floor. with a slice of cheese. at the end. and i’ll show you speed skating
the human and i. have decided. that angels don’t have wings. they have vests. and are covered in fur 	https://t.co/mnV4Uswsub
the human. and the human’s fren. are all dressed up to go out. and once again. my fren and i. don’t seem to be invited.. the good news is. i jumped on them both. so pieces of me. will be tagging along. whether they like it. or not
gooooob morning. i want to formally declare. that my stuffed fren sebastian. is my valentine. there are never before seen. levels of snugs. in his future
i. have two walking speeds. they are as follows.. faster than you. and 	completely. immobile
something. i’ve been thinking about. for a while. is that i love you
the human’s fren came over. and made the mistake. of sitting on the floor. now they must stay there. with me in their lap. for eternity. that is the law
i encourage everyone. to pet the pup. at whatever party you attend tonight. they’re working overtime. and deserve undivided attention
the humans on the tv. are pretty good. but i can do a triple spin. too.. it’s before i lie down. and never on ice. but still
gooooob morning. i am already. several hours into my skittle watching shift. there is no movement. to report so far.. i did however. hear the fridge make new cube water. perhaps this is a warning. of impending battle
our walk today. was rather wet. my fren stayed in his wagon. under a blanket. while i endured the elements
sometimes. when my fren commences the night snoozle. before me. i will rest my chin. on his noggin. to encourage. sweet dreams
there are many humans. in the household. and i will not rest. until every single one. has dropped a chip. in my honor
the human told me. the only reason. i wasn’t drafted in the puppy bowl. is because my opponents. wouldn’t stand a chance
sometimes. there’s a fellow pup. on the tv. and i try to tell them. i enjoy their work. but they never hear me
occasionally. if i see a car come down the street. i will trot swiftly. across the household. while letting out. tiny half borks.. this is to warn the car. that i am to be taken. seriously
we are working on. the shake. which is an advanced move. that requires balance. trust. and more importantly. an intense understanding of unwritten contracts
on my calendar for today. it says. peanut butter. with no further instructions. i accept this challenge
gooooob morning. i made. some love cards		https://t.co/g8UJshEfIv https://t.co/y1tzj7On2s
i had a long talk. with my fren. about how to spot. a fake ball throw. the optimal strategy. is to follow the ball. with your eyes. instead of your heart
otis. i too. have zoomed purely out of passion. you will persevere. and return stronger than ever https://t.co/6oERlzPQIw
the human. spent all day. doing various things. to various foods. there was frustration. and some spills. but i helped with both. just by being there.. i didn’t realize. until the human’s fren came over. that it was all for them. and it didn’t matter. if the food was good. or not
please take note. of the following..	i love you
one time. during a walk. a piece of a bagel. landed right in front of me. the human thinks. a birb dropped it. but i didn’t see a birb.. every time. we return to that spot. i glance up. with the hopes that. another tasty magic bagel drop. happens to me
gooooob morning. the human has left. my fren is monitoring. the skittle under the fridge. and i am on a mission. to find. the most comfortable spot. in every room. of the household
it is movie night. the whole gang. is on the couch. i am snuggling. my stuffed fren sebastian. we are both being snuggled. by the human’s fren. and the human. is close to them. snuggling my fren.. according to the transitive property. of snugs.	everyone. is snuggling. everyone
all these snoozles. can get exhausting.. it is a vicious cycle. of peanut butter filled. pseudo-consciousness
after every snoozle. there is a stretchem. one cannot occur. without the other. i don’t make the rules
gooooob morning. the fancy rain. is still falling.. i consulted. my stuffed fren sebastian. and we determined. that today is for snoozles. and nothing else
my fren. has carefully selected. his bone for the day. the problem. is that now i want that bone. and yes. there are plenty. of other bones. in the household. with identical attributes. but none of them compare. to the bone. my fren has right now
sometimes. the human gets sad. and i don’t know why. but if i jump. in their lap. and stay there. i can usually fix it
i understand. that my feets. must be dried. before i re-enter the household. but you are mistaken. if you think. i won’t run around. with the towel. afterwards
the human. and the human’s fren. got dressed up all fancy. to go out tonight. and apparently. i wasn’t invited.. it is not my fault. i can’t tie a tie
duncan. you will beat this. and i love you https://t.co/tsA6LqQKCa
after today’s. ear related calamity. i have vowed not to make. any sudden movements. without human supervision
my ear. is inside out. and the human. is not home to fix it. i have put the household. on alert level. dark grey.
my stuffed fren. sebastian. is always honest with me. when i tell him my ideas. for example. i told him my idea. for dog pants. that have a never ending supply. of peanut butter. in each pocket. but he said. that wouldn’t be. very practical
today. i fell asleep. while i was supposed to be. watching the skittle. under the fridge.. i’m aware that my actions. go against. the household moral code. and will accept my punishment. of reduced couch-bound snoozles. in the morning
a nice human. came to the household. to install some carpet. on the stairs.. to thank them. for the extra traction. i contributed. my close presence. the entire time
i will order some. for the human. and make them put it on. every morning. before they leave https://t.co/B3E9coeMWa
the human. is hosting a get together. this evening. and my job. is to greet the guests. without jumping on them.. a nearly. impossible task
it took until today. for the human. to remove the tree. (basically. big stick] from the household. yet i. still can’t bring any of my favorite sticks. inside. the hypocrisy. is overwhelming
it is. way too chilly. to exit the household. i would like. indoor bathroom accommodations. pronto
i get. the majority. of my work done. between my midday snoozle. and my early afternoon snoozle.. for example. today during that time. i rolled onto my back. and wiggled a bit
gooooob morning. i have stolen. the human’s shoe. in an attempt to. seriously delay. or prevent their departure. entirely
i have performed. the security lap. around the household.. all is well. ready your snugs. snoozetown awaits
i heard. something about. making resolutions. and although i’m perfect. i have a few:		4. more peanut butter	b. increase. zoom efficiency	3. improve my sits	1. convince the human. i’m invisible	4. longer snoozles	f. sticks	2. more peanut butter	7. further turn up. the love dial
gooooob morning. i decided. to congratulate the human. on a good snoozle. with some toilet paper. what i do is. i nibble at the roll. until i secure the end piece. then i run around. like the wind. until it’s all gone.. i hope they like it
the afternoon walk. was very chilly. i made. the executive decision. to quit halfway. and get in the wagon. with my fren. there is no law against this. in the walking rulebook. i checked
the human and i. watched it. together https://t.co/hZnoXbIx2w
the human’s fren. came over. for movie night. but the movie ended. hours ago. i’m usually woken up. around this time. to say goobbye.. i guess they’re trying. a duo snoozle
i was playing. tug of war. with the human. and they scratched my ear. this distraction. was my downfall. and should be. against the law
things have calmed down. in the household. apparently. the house tree. only brings gifts once. so we spent the day. painting flames. on the fren’s wagon. so it looks like. he’s going much faster. than he is.. that was my idea
the human. brought everyone outside. except my fren. who was told to sit and stay. for a moment. we gathered around. the human’s surprise. then called him.. it is the best wagon ever. the human tested it. with me a few times. and let me say. the fren. will love walks. once again
gooooob morning. the house tree. brought gifts. and now. i must remind everyone. that i. am the real gift here
when i awoke. my stuffed fren sebastian. was all cuddled up with me. i brought him closer. and commenced a second snoozle. to make up. for lost dreams
the human took. my stuffed fren sebastian. away. they said he needed. to be washed. and that i could. have him back. in the morning. but that’s a long time. from now.. what if i get lonely
clifford. do not worry. that wiggle. will be corrected. in no time https://t.co/ZlTE8dmL6f
i was deep in snoozle. when the fridge. decided we needed. more cube water.. i checked cube levels. earlier today. that’s the last thing. we need right now
gooooob morning. the human finished. the surprise in the garage. for my fren. but told me. that i must. keep it a secret. a little while longer.. this will be difficult. because all i have. to take. my mind off telling him. is this skittle. under the fridge
the human. just got home. i have no idea. where they’ve been. but in their absence. they’ll be proud to see. that i took it. upon myself. to redistribute. all the footwear. i could find. throughout the household. because i decided. that was. my duty
i have just discovered. a little me. hanging on. the house tree. he is. unbelievably handsome. and i will protect him. at all costs
the human’s fren. is over.. they sat on the floor. and let me snuggle up. in their lap. the human must be. so jealous
gooooob morning. it got quite chilly. on our walk. so the human. lent me their earmuffs. all the passersby. complimented. these cozy ears
please find. your entertainment. elsewhere https://t.co/WtTMo935eT
i have successfully removed. some of the tiny lights. from the house tree. i bet the human. has never seen. an indoor zoom. with such radiance
the human. is cheering at the tv. must be. the sports again
i spend. my valuable time. attempting to smuggle. measly sticks. into this household. now the human thinks. they can just. bring a whole tree in. under the cover. of my snoozle. i don’t think so
there is a tree. in the household. i went to take. my late afternoon snoozle. and i come back. now there’s a tree.. who approved of this. i didn’t. is this. one of many? what depths. does this tree army reach. where is the human. i have questions
gooooob morning. did you know. that if one sits. very well. and looks up at the human. with a straight face. the human will be forced. to stay home. an extra few minutes. and give attention
remember. when that leaf. fell on my noggin. and i became emperor. of the yard. well.. even though. the leaves are done falling. i want to clarify. i haven’t yet. relinquished the throne
i. have been on skittle watch. all day. and guess what. it hasn’t moved. i almost. grrborked at it. in frustration. but i’m afraid. it could. retaliate
it’s movie night. once again.. the human’s fren. came over. the human built their first fire. and i helped. make the pupcorn.. the whole gang. is snug on the couch. including. my stuffed fren. sebastian. who always falls asleep. before the film. even starts
the human. stayed home today. to work on the surprise. in the garage. they let me take a peek. because it’s actually. a surprise. for my fren. and i’m very good. at keeping secrets
the human says. there are two options.. inside or outside. but if they would. elevate their mindset. they would uncover. a third option: stand. in the doorway. and sniff the air
the human came home. and immediately. started making. all sorts of commotion. in the garage. my fren and i. wanted to help. but the human said. what they’re doing. is a surprise
bentley. listen closely. you got this https://t.co/DmjWmCQa2E
let me tell you. about. my stuffed fren. sebastian.. he is. my sidekick pal. and i take him everywhere. he has the floppiest ears. and a long skinny snoot. his arm fell off once. but the human fixed it. he always agrees with me. unless i’m wrong. and without him. i’d be lost
gooooob morning. i found a button. and decided to swallow it. but before i could. the human jumped on me. from like. three rooms away. i guess. this particular button. means a lot to them
the human gets. quite passionate. about the sportsball. on the tv. i usually. bork in agreement. to support them
hi. i have some big news. but it must. remain secret. according to my fren. very soon. everything. will be attacked. by little lights.. a tree. will grow. inside the household.. the rain drops. will get fancier.. and one morning. we open boxes. that contain. your wildest dreams
i. had a nightmare. that the boing sproings. behind the doors. came to life. and started chasing me
my fren. is already snoring. kind of impressive. in a way.. he took the afternoon walk. very slow. stopping to smell. everything he could. i spent that time. wrapping the leash. around the human. as many times. as possible
i always. make sure to say. goobnight. to my stuffed fren. sebastian. even though. he never says it back.. everyone. should be wished. a good night
the human. bought a device. for my bowl. that forces me. to eat slower. do they not understand. that eating at an extreme pace. is the one thing. i truly excel at
gooooob morning. my stuffed fren. sebastian. and i. are on skittle watch duty. until the afternoon snooze. the skittle. i speak of. is under the fridge. and hasn’t moved. ever.. but one day. it could. and that is why. we watch
there’s. a single chair. that the human. told me. i’m not allowed on. why is it special? no idea. but of course. now i want to snooze on it. very bad.. i will slowly climb up. one limb at a time. and hopefully. no one will notice
the human’s fren. is over. once more. they let me. sit in their lap. for a long time. and they played with my ears.. it doesn’t seem like. they have a pup. of their own.. that’s ok. i can be. their pup too
the human. stayed home. today. you know what that means? snuggle. marathon
let me. recap the evening.. i met a ton. of people. who acted. like they knew me. then. i sat under the big table. pleading unsuccessfully. for a snackum. until i found. the seat. of a small human. who was willing to share.. overall. an exhausting day. the night snoozle awaits
gooooob morning. there are already. so many smells happening. today. has potential
i know. how scary. bath time can be. so whenever. the human showers. i make sure. i’m also. in the bathroom.. for solidarity
i think. what’s really important here. is that. i love you
gooooob morning. the human. is off. to do. whatever the human does. and i. am off. to try to fit. my entire foot. in my ear
gooooob morning. a lot happened. on our walk. this morning. i found. a perfectly good waffle. in somebody’s trash. the human. didn’t let me. have it though. there was also. a very frightening. leaf tornado
i. am cuddling. with my stuffed fren. sebastian. and the human. is cuddling. with me.. does that mean. the human. is cuddling. sebastian?
time. is speeding up. don’t believe me? i used. to eat dinner. before it got dark. now i eat dinner. as it’s getting dark. checkmate
one day. kronos. one day. that record. will be yours https://t.co/wbARHYPov9
so you know how. my bed. was shrinking? well. it has remained. pretty much. the same size. for many many snoozles now. perhaps. it’s done shrinking
ok. all is well. the human. came out and almost immediately. found sebastian. mostly. i am grateful. but also. the human. didn’t need to show off like that.. sebastian seems. unharmed. but i think we’re done with. leaves. for the day
i have misplaced. my stuffed fren. sebastian. in the leaves
gooooob morning. my stuffed fren. sebastian. and i. are going to play in the leaves now. it should be. a grand time
whenever. the human. makes a snack. my fren and i. will patiently wait. to be given. a part of said snack. even if we’re not. as long as. the human feels. guilty about it. mission accomplished
it is movie night. and the human. and the human’s fren. are cuddling. on the couch. i will sit at their feet. and stare at them. until. a spot is made. in between them. for me
quick life hack: sticks. are too big. to easily smuggle. into the household. try a woodchip.. thank you. for your time
“while. the human’s away. the dogs. will play” no sir. my fren and i. protect this household. very seriously
i. had a nightmare. and i guess. the human heard me. because now. we’re both. all snugged up. on the floor
sometimes. if a treat. is on the line. i’m asked. to sit.. one last good boy test. but i’m usually. so excited. i can only do. several half sits. i think. those should count
i’m sorry i haven’t. shared my thoughts. recently. i was asleep. and when i wasn’t. i wanted. to be
the human. went out. with their fren. but accidentally. left their coat.. i have turned it. into a blanket. the smell. of the human. somehow makes it. cozier
my day. isn’t too busy. after the midday snooze. i have a meeting. with my stuffed fren. sebastian. about the power. of peanut butter.. also. it’s almost my shift. to watch the skittle. under the fridge
the human. just refilled. our food bowls. thinking that. they forgot to feed. my fren and i. this. is a magical night. second dinner. rules
sometimes. when i’m in need. of attention. (which is. always} i locate. a shoe. take it. and trot by the human. it may take. multiple passes. before the chase. but it never. ever fails
i want. a crown https://t.co/XnwXewF7NN
gooooob morning. we took our morning walk. in between. the bursts of rain. BUT. the leftover tree droplets. were still. quite powerful
the human. accepted the sock. and puppreciated. my honestly. we agreed that. i’d need to be monitored. outside. for a bit.. as for my fren. i lent him. my stuffed fren. sebastian. to snuggle. for the evening
after much thought. i have decided. to come forward. regarding. the hole situation. i will. at the same time. return a sock. to the human. that i stole. a long time ago. hopefully. that helps my case. somehow
the human. got mad. at my fren. because a hole. was discovered. in the yard. but it wasn’t my fren. it was me. i don’t know why. i dug it. but it felt good. at the time
goobnight. to all. and to all. a goobnight
signs. of maximum excite:		2. quick. spinny circles	8. leaps (all kinds}	5. feets. a tippy tappin	c. sustained zooms	1. tail thuddles
sometimes. when the human. isn’t home. i go. to the top of the stairs. and drop my ball. then i race past it. and catch it. at the bottom. i do this. until the ball wins
my fren. is all snuggled up. on the couch. with the human. that’s ok. i have my stuffed fren. sebastian. to keep me company.. all aboard. snoozetown awaits
gooooob morning. my fren and i. found the perfect stick. on our walk. we took turns. carrying it home. BUT ONCE AGAIN. we were denied entry. by the human. until we let it go.. may we meet again
my best trick. is the sit. unless we’re on hardwood. then i excel. at the sit and slide. right now i’m working. on a new trick. it is. not taking. seven naps. in one day
i think. that was the last. of the little monsters. what a night. i received. many noggin pats. and spider-man. gave me. a hug
there are little monsters. at the door. they are allowed. two pieces. of candy. and three. noggin pats. the candy. can of course. be swapped. for more pats
the skittle. under the fridge. that might be. an m&amp;m. still hasn’t moved.. but do not worry. i’ll let everyone know. if it does
i was carrying. my stuffed fren. sebastian. around earlier. and his arm. fell off.. i kept him calm. while the human. performed surgery. i’m proud to announce. sebastian. is whole again. and doing wonderfully
the human. got me. a sailor hat. so i could be. a ship captain. for the party. tonight. this is appropriate. without me. this household. would veer. way off course
a bunch of monsters. have entered the household. i can’t even recognize. my own human. everyone. is rather frenly though. a skeleton. scritched my ear
noah. listen very carefully. you. got this https://t.co/LoH1ZzFU2b
the human believes. they lose their socks. in the washing machine. but oh no. i steal them. way before that
snackum.. has been slipped. first to me. then to. my fren. the life is good
the human’s fren. came over. for dinner. this is the final test. if they. slip a snackum. under the table. they are welcome here. for eternity
i hear. a borking. in the distance. this means. i too. must bork. so that everyone knows. i heard. the initial borking. it’s common courtesy
gary. (the squirrel. i named. gary} was just way up. in that tree. next second. he’s in. this other tree. then. he’s over here. then over there. it is becoming. very clear. that gary. {the squirrel. i named. gary) has cloned himself. what seems to be. many times
every night. i make sure to tell. my stuffed fren. sebastian. what we have to do. the next day. because. i always forget.. this. is a bad plan. because sebastian. never remembers. either
wet leaves. don’t crunch. this is. absurd
gooooob morning. it is raining. but the human. was late for work. so i didn’t. have time. to jump. in the puddles. don’t worry though. later today. those puddles. won’t know. what hit em
i’ve become. quite fond. of the human’s fren.. as soon as. they came over tonight. they got on the floor. and let me. tackle them. with my love. i then. winked at my human. to indicate. my pupproval
i have. no plans today. i rescheduled. the meeting. with my fren. about how to prevent. indoor zooming injuries. because. that’s boring
today. is a snuggle day. please set aside. some quality time. for snugs
alright. let me tell you. about our adventure. it started. with a car ride. windows down. tongue out. the whole bit. i swallowed. a sizable bug. but didn’t let that. stop me. we arrived. at a big puddle. the fren and i. did a splish splash. and now we’re home. it was delightful
THE GARAGE DOOR. IS OPENING. MY FEETS. ARE TIPPY TAPPIN. THE HUMAN. IS HOME. IT IS. ADVENTURE TIME
gooooob morning. the human promised. to come home. early. today. that means. adventure time. is coming. the tail is blurry
i want. to wish you all. the goobest. of goobnights
i tripped. going up. the stairs today. fell snoot first. it wasn’t pleasant. my solution.. ban. every stair
the human. has made mountains. out of. the fallen leaves. it is. quite clearly. my destiny. to jump in them
gooooob morning. today. i’m giving. my new stuffed fren. sebastian. a household tour. he will get. to see. everything. from the human snoozle chamber. to the skittle. under the fridge
please. remember. to perform. at least three. goobnight noggin pats. before the night snoozle. it goes. a long way
the human thinks. i won’t get excited. if they say. doubleyouayellkay. instead of. walk. but guess what. i am excited
today. i tried to eat. a fruit roll up. but the human. stopped me. and said. that wouldn’t have been. in my. best interests
earlier today. the human said. that without. my fren and i. they would be nothing. and now. i can’t sleep. because that’s. a lot of pressure
ok. so it turns out. i was lying on him. this whole time. please set. the household alert level. back. to very light grey
i. have misplaced. my new stuffed fren. sebastian. this is not. a drill
we just got back. from the best walk. ever. my fren. set the pace. i found. a delightful stick. and it was. just chilly enough. that we would hurry. to the next spot. where the sun. broke through the trees
let me. set the scene.. the human. is holding my paw. sebastian. is snuggled up. under. my other paw. and the fren. has already commenced. his dream zooms. the night snoozle. fast approaches
earlier today. a complete stranger. told me. that i am very good. my tail. is still wagging
my favorite. leisurely. activities:		4. snoozles	c. indoor. sun bathing	1. snugs (two person. snoozle}	3. admiring various. sticks	3. walks. with breaks	• outdoor sun bathing	9. staring at. the skittle	d. loving you	2. letting the human. rub. my ear. to a john mayer song
the best part. about. my new stuffed fren. sebastian. is that. he listens. not only. to my problems. but to my dreams. my goals. my ideas. for example.. peanut butter leashes
i have. BIG news. remember the package. from earlier. that i protected. so well? turns out. it waS FOR ME. ALL ALONG. i now have. a new stuffed fren. he has. a super long nose. little mouth horns. and tremendous. floppy ears. i will call him.. sebastian
I HEARD. A KNOCKEM. AT THE DOOR. AND WHEN I INVESTIGATED. I DISCOVERED. A PACKAGE. JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR. I WILL PROTECT IT. UNTIL THE HUMAN. RETURNS
gooooob morning. i had a nightmare. that. both my ears. were inside out. and then i sprouted. a third ear.. guess what. also inside out
unless. it’s top secret. and involves. covert pupperations
sometimes. the human. will lift up. my ear. to tell me something.. this is. completely. unnecessary
sometimes. when we play catch. with the human. i let my fren. get to the ball. first. he’s not as speedy. as he once was. but he still deserves. the boundless joy. that comes with. a good fetch
today. i ate a leaf. not because it tasted good. but because. the crunch sound. is addicting
i used. to throw up. during car rides. but now. i don’t sometimes
sometimes. i wish. the human. needed a hug. because secretly. i do
do not worry. keno. soon. you will zoom. again https://t.co/O0TxgkbVso
gooooob morning. my schedule. is unusually clear. today. only one meeting later. with my fren. about whether the skittle. under the fridge. is actually. an m&amp;m
this is. hey. look at me. this is very. hey. eyes please. the following. is very important.. i love you
last night. in the middle. of the night. my fren. grrbork borked. signifying. a household alert level. of dark grey. i immediately. did my standard surveillance. and found nothing. when i returned. to the fren. he had already. recommenced. his snoozle
the human’s fren. is over again. we’re not on good terms. at the moment. they need to learn. how to share the human. and understand. that i was here. first
just woke up. from my. mid-afternoon snooze. which takes place. after the midday snooze. but before. both the early dusk power snooze. and. the night snoozle
gooooob morning. may your zooms. be speedy. and your tail thuds. echo with love
i for one. am more than ready. for the night snoozle. but first. a recap. of my day.. gary. (the squirrel. i named. gary) hurled an acorn. that i dodged narrowly. but dodged. nonetheless. then. i checked on the skittle. under the fridge. as. you may have guessed. it hasn’t moved
on one paw. i enjoy. lying in the sun. it makes me feel. not only cozy. but also. magnificent. on the other paw. puddles are fun. and splish splashing. is my passion
the deal. with the human. is that. for every good dog. they see. in the book. they have to also. tell me. i’m. a good dog	https://t.co/CJdjDCOo9B
the human stared. at the tv. for so long. i don’t think. a smile occurred. all day. i just chewed. the remote. to absolute bits. you cannot hurt. my human. anymore
my ear. covered my eye. for a second. in that moment. i. was already committed. to my new life. as a pirate
the human. just gave. the fren and i. the biggest hugs. they’ll be late for work. but i don’t think. they care
i. was lying outside. minding. my own business. and a single leaf. fell. from the tree. and landed. on my noggin. i am now. emperor. of this yard
the fren. has told me. about this time. of year. apparently. the leaves. turn all shades. of muted yellow. and soon. the tiny humans. transform. into monsters. but even they. in their spooky state. still get to eat. chocolate
the human left. to go hangout. with their fren.. that’s fine. everything’s fine. i’ll just be here. working on my. very important dog stuff. and contemplating. my own. replaceability
if you hear. a single bork. and then. absolute silence. that was me. testing the acoustics. of the household
gooooob morning. last night. i. had a dream. that i dug. a hole. in the yard. and found a treasure chest. in the chest. was peanut butter. today. i see if my dream. will come true
GUESS WHAT. there is now. more room. for me to tell you. all about. my day. so. sit back. relax. and enjoy. my existence.. it all started. with my morning stretchem. this was quickly. followed by. an inherent goodness. sweeping over me. and blessing. everyone. in the vicinity
alright. here. is the deal. i support and love you. til the end. of time. and you..... give me. that cheese stick
I’VE GOT. BIG NEWS.. i love you
human. cleaned up. all my toys for me. i know. it’s only because. their fren is coming over. and they want to. appear responsible. but still
it used. to take me. several attempts. to summit the couch. now. one leap. and it’s. game over
i stole. the human’s sock. and they didn’t even. chase me. i guess. they’re not. in the mood. i was only joking. i always. give it back
what would i do. with more characters? well. i could tell you. all about. hoW TODAY. I DID A ZOOM. SO SPEEDY. MY EARS FLEW BACK. IT WAS AMAZ
if i. don’t win. it’s rigged https://t.co/YL3WPpR6aZ
gooooob morning. i snuck. a stick. inside the house
i. am watching. a movie. about a bee. on the couch. with my fren. the human. and the human’s fren. who is also now. my fren. too
showed the fren. how to do. the front paw cross. in case. he's ever feeling. particularly fancy
WE. ARE OUTSIDE. THE HUMAN. IS THROWING THE BALL. VERY HIGH. THE FREN AND I. JUST RUN. IN ONE DIRECTION. UNTIL WE HEAR IT. HIT THE GROUND
all. the good boys. know. when to sit
petting me. with your foot. only counts. as half a pet
sometimes. i let the human know. i need to go out. but then. i stand. in the doorway. and just. sniff the air. this. annoys the human
fren. and i. were both doing a tug. on the same. toy. obviously. i let the fren win. because i. had already had. a long. and tiring day
i. will get one. for my human. so they know. they miss me https://t.co/HgTarMU5ES
the snoozles. they have. consumed me
the night snooze. fast approaches. do not forget. the triple noggin pat. indicating. sweet dreams
gary. (the squirrel. i named. gary} thinks. he's so cool. running along the top. of the fence. and such. i could do that. if i wanted to
i know. i already said. goobnight. but the human. made. a night sandwich. and forgot to drop. a piece of cheese. that. is against. the law
i wonder if. anybody. reads these. thoughts of mine. that'd be. rather embarrassing. oh well. goobnight. i love you. big time
i used to fit. so snug. on my bed. now at least. one feets. hangs off. at all times. there is only one. explanation. the bed. is shrinking
my fren's face. is grayer than. the rest of him. this could only mean. one thing. he. is a wizard
sorry. for the lack of. thoughts yesterday. my life is normally. a confined. magical. ever-changing odyssey. but not yesterday. i just slept
my fren. fell asleep. on me. his head. is lying. on my stomach. which makes me. incredibly aware. of my own breathing
i took. the morning walk. a little slower. today. thought about. how happy i am. alongside. my fren. and my human. the life. is good
the human. who snuggled. my human. the other night. is here again. BUT. this time. however. they brought. my fren and i. treats.. we approve
the human. came home. smelling like. another pup. i've never experienced. such an intense. betrayal
WE WENT. ON A WALK. BY THE RIVER. THE HUMAN. THREW SOME BOUNCY ROCKS. INTO IT. THE FREN AND I. PLAYED TAG. I WISH. YOU COULD'VE. SEEN US
human. promised. they'd come home early. and take. my fren and i. on an adventure
the day. has been completed. off to snoozeland. i. love you
i once. tricked the human. into thinking. my tongue pops out. every time. they touched. my front left paw. until one time. i forgot to do it
there is. another human here. cuddling close. on the couch. with my human. i. will forcibly. create a space. between them. for me
i. accidentally. stole some paper towels. and decorated. the household
the first time. the human brushed me. i thought. i was. falling apart
i. will go to. incredible lengths. to make sure. the sun shines on me. while i snooze
the morning walk. was very wet. i jumped. in a puddle
the human. did not have. a good day. i. will go get. my finest ball. for them. it always makes. me happy
my. daily commitment. to you. is that. something important. will be knocked over. by my tail. when i'm excite
sometimes. i drool. incomprehensible amounts. it's not. on purpose. it just. sorta happens
the human. fell asleep. on the couch. between me. and my fren. it is. the coziest. of pup sandwiches
today. i stole. an entire. avocado. took the human. several house loops. to take it back
the human. brought frens over. one of them. forgot to pet me. as they entered. that individual. has 30 seconds. to rectify. the situation
i grrrborked. at the hurricane. on the tv. it did not. do much. i apologize
being. as good. as i am. day in. and day out. is quite. strenuous
i was dreaming. that i was. zooming. through watermelon fields. and accidentally. kicked the fren. waking. us both
i've been working on. some combo moves. for instance. the tap tap bork hop. that one. is pretty. self explanatory
i remember. when i was. addicted to. the sproing boing. wall toy. behind the door. now i walk past it. and scoff. for i am better. than it
i drank. all the water. in my bowl. earlier. but just now. i returned. to the same bowl. and it was. full again.. the bowl. is haunted
today. my only goal. is to not. get stuck. in the bathroom
my favorite. pastimes. include:		7. the snooze	• stick reviews	2. staring at. the skittle	3. zoom tutorials	b) loving you	2. peanut butter
the human. has found me. thank you human. yes everything's fine. i don't. really. want to talk about it. i need. my space. for a bit
what if. i never see. the human again? what if. i never play. with my fren. again? what if. i never. lick peanut butter. off a spoon. again?
i have. been trapped here. for an estimated. 9 days
there seems to be. an elaborate. water bowl. which will prove. useful. in due time
i'm not sure. why. i came in here. in the first place. oh well. this is. my new home now
i trapped myself. in the bathroom. don't ask. how it happened. now. i'm just sitting here. waiting for. helicopter evac
when it comes. to the sports. i try. to mimic. the human's. reactions. i must support. even if. i have no idea. what's happening
if i. am sleeping on you. you cannot move. it is. the law
gary. (the squirrel. i named. gary} is slowly tapping. on the window. with an acorn. he is staring. through my soul
i only bork. at my reflection. to test. my own. reflexes
sometimes. i fall asleep. easily. other times. it's like. let me think. all the thoughts. i've ever thunk. real quick. i want. peanut butter
some toys. were big. AND. very chewable. you see the problem. i encountered
i spent. all day. organizing my toys. from biggest. to most chewable. it didn't go. as well. as i'd hoped
i found. such a nice stick. on my walk. this morning. carried it. all the way back home. but was denied. entry. until i let go. of it
the fren snores. sometimes. and i think "i too. am trying. to snooze over here. buddy." but i don't say it. because i'm not. bold. like that
i would like. to kindly. request. a lengthy. snug
early morning walks. are for. practicing. fancy trots. and prances
sometimes. i will. bork up the household. for no reason. at all. a practice run. if you will. for when the house. actually needs. borking up
if. my tummy. is rubbed. at 207 or more. rpms (rubs. per minute}. i lose. any and all control. of back legs. hence. the swift air kicks
i've been staring. at my fren's ears. all morning. they stick. straight pupwards. regardless of. level of. excite
everyone. is talking about. this fight. when they should be. talking about. me

the human. turned off the tv. then lied down. beside me. i don't think. everything. is okay
ok. let me summarize. we went. on a big walk. to some water. that i splish splashed in. then. we walked back. it was. dare i say. magical
HUMAN. CAME HOME. NOW I AM IN THE CAR. FRONT SEAT. WINDOW DOWN. TONGUE OUT. IN THE WIND. TO WHAT. DO I OWE. SUCH A PLEASURE

gary. {the squirrel. i named. gary) hurled an acorn. that hit me. square. on the noggin. this morning

correct me. if i'm wrong. but. i think. i would like. a hug
boops. not nukes
a new week. is upon us. or so i am told. human. time constructs. are confusing. i prefer. to break it down. into snoozes. and non-snoozes
how about. i only. use it. when i'm sharing my thoughts. and chasing my tail. at. the same time
i! have discovered! a new! punctuation! not sure yet! what it means!
gary. [the squirrel. i named. gary} is staring at me. through. the screen door. as if to say. "bring it. young doggo"
