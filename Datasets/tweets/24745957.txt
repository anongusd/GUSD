3) The proposed public charge rule will increase hunger. Decreased participation among Georgia immigrant families in food assistance could lead to higher levels of poverty &amp; food insecurity.
2) Simply put, this rule change will make our communities sicker because families will fear to participate in Medicaid could result in coverage losses throughout GA, decreased access to care, and worse health outcomes for the entire family, including U.S. citizen children.

Sadly, Trump voters who were deceived by the xenophobic dog whistle 'Make America Great Again' must now realize that a white nationalist U.S. president is selling out America to the international white nationalism movement led by Vladimir Putin. #TreasonSummit
If that is true, then President Trump has put his own interests above those of the nation that he is sworn to protect and serve. Such action is a betrayal of the trust and confidence of the American people, and could be called treasonous. #TreasonSummt

To avoid the appearance of impropriety, the Senate should not consider a Supreme Court appointment from a President who is under the kind of cloud that this President is under. #SCOTUSPick	#WhatsAtStake We must allow the American people to speak at the ballot box first.
Moreover, the Supreme Court may soon be called upon to consider whether President Trump can be subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury or whether a sitting President can be indicted. #SCOTUSPick #WhatsAtStake

The GOP House farm bill guts nearly $20B from #SNAP--our nation’s most important &amp; effective anti-hunger program. This could ultimately result in higher levels of hunger &amp; poverty, worse health &amp; other negative outcomes. We must #protectSNAP. https://t.co/GrayfYB0wT https://t.co/yhGozLoNSF
The #GOPTaxScam was not written for middle-class workers. In GA, the top 5% of earners get more than 66% of tax breaks under the GOP plan. Nationwide, the richest Americans get a $33,000 tax break under the #GOPTaxScam. The poorest get just $40. https://t.co/m7kM0W2qFr
... and now that @HouseGOP has blown a huge hole in the deficit, Trump &amp; Republicans in Congress are looking to force deep cuts to Medicare,Medicaid, Social Security &amp; education to pay for their giveaway to the rich. #smh https://t.co/yaIPbr9uMP
