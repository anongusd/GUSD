Thank you to everyone who joined us today, including our guest speakers from @schoolhouseconn and @savethechildren. Stay tuned for more information and resources as this month of Whole Health continues. #HealthyHeadStart
Whitney and Garvin have shared an impressive range of resources to help #HeadStart programs address this critical topic that impacts children and families in our communities every day.
"Even though the #HeadStart Performance Standards allow programs to fill up to 10% of their slots with over-income children... our commitment is to those children and families of greatest need first" - Garvin
#HeadStart currently serves more over-income children than children who are experiencing homelessness. We must prioritize homelessness as a selection criteria for enrollment.
Most families who are experiencing homeless qualify because they are ‚Äúdoubled up,‚Äù and living with another family because of economic hardship. It‚Äôs important we are reaching out to all of them.
Gavin is sharing actionable strategies for Head Start programs to better serve these children. He suggests methods to improve the identification of children and families experiencing homeless for enrollment.
Over the years, Head Start has increased the population of children they serve who are experiencing homelessness. Garvin shares that in 2008, only 1.7% of #HeadStart enrollment was comprised of children experiencing homelessness.  In 2017, that number increased to 4.8%.
92% of children who are experience homelessness are unserved by #HeadStart.
Whitney stresses the importance of reaching out and identifying families that are not familiar with the front door to #HeadStart, and making sure they can find it and that we are holding it open.
A new part of the #HeadStart program performance standards allow for programs to reserve up to 3% of funded slots for homeless and require them to establish collaborative relationships with local LEA liaison.
‚ÄúThe new face of homelessness is the face of a young child,‚Äù says Whitney, @SchoolHouseConn, who reports that those with the highest risk of being homelessness are under 1 year old.
LIVE: We have Grace Whitney, @schoolhouseconn‚Äôs Director of Early Childhood Initiatives, and Khari Garvin, @savethechildren‚Äôs Executive Director of Head Start Programs joining us for a #HealthyHeadStart webinar to help #HeadStart address this issue.
Head Start and Early Head Start can play a significant role in supporting children and families experiencing homelessness, yet this is an area that is often overlooked. #HealthyHeadStart
Children who experience homelessness need more support and attention. During this Whole Health month, we‚Äôre highlighting expert speakers and sharing resources related to this critical topic that impacts children and families in our communities every day. #HealthyHeadStart
Experiencing homelessness can also impact access to health services and lead to higher risks of physical and mental health problems. #HealthyHeadStart
Children who lack stable home environments can experience strong threats to healthy development like hunger, poverty, and traumatic events. This insecurity can impact their ability to attend and succeed in school. #HealthyHeadStart
Homelessness impacts millions of children every day. During the 2014-2015 school year, over 1.2 million children under 6 yrs old‚Äîthat‚Äôs 1 in 20‚Äîexperienced homelessness in the United States. https://t.co/EtB7HS1EOU #HealthyHeadStart #hhweek

They have been tracking the ACE scores of their children; the average being a 7. TIPs puts together multidisciplinary treatment plans. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just a mental health based program, it‚Äôs not just a school-based program,‚Äù Kate said.
The TIP program gets several no-shows, but once they get families involved, they see a 90% completion rate. They provide transportation for their children and complete home visiting.
‚ÄúAt TIPS, the majority of our children live in a constant state of change. While services are out there for them, the families do not get involved unless there is outside pressure getting them to enroll.‚Äù

They have also seen cities interested in educating women and providing free access to long-acting, reversible contraception to prevent Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome.
They have seen cities placing community health and social workers in schools to support students‚Äô health and behavioral health needs, as well as programming and mindfulness training.
Some of the trends they have been seeing is higher rates of NAS in the Child Welfare system.
We have Leah Ettman from @leagueofcities to speak about the findings and next steps established at the Mayors‚Äô Institute on Opioids.
Mothers who have opioid use disorder have a high percentage of trauma exposure. We need to make sure that we provide a nonjudgmental environment and they are recognized for their strength, then we can help them with any weaknesses that they might have.
A healthy mother-infant relationship, we know that it‚Äôs a common tenant for children that have not been exposed in utro, but we need to recognize the importance for these children as well.
We have Dr. Karol Kaltenbach on the line to speak about treatment for pregnant women with substance use disorder and neonatal abstinence syndrome.
Head Start can be an important part of a long-term solution. We've undertaken a mission to elevate the critical role that Head Start is already playing and its untapped potential.
We came up the following recommendations: 	1) Provide new resources to implement multi-tiered, proven models	2) Increase specialized personnel capacity	3) Provide trauma identification &amp; response training for staff 	4) Support analysis to evaluate the treatment's impact
After putting together a working group, we found that for some programs, it wasn‚Äôt a conversation about opioids. For some, it was about methamphetamine and for others it was about alcohol, but the needs were the same. #breaktheaddictioncycle
