Feeling kind of “meh” about Elizabeth Warren. Really looking for @KamalaHarris @amyklobuchar and @TulsiGabbard to announce their candidacies. Hoping they end up running together, or with someone like @SenJeffMerkley 		#uspol #Election2020 #Kamala2020	#Klobuchar2020 #Tulsi2020
@mikebinthesky @amyklobuchar I agree. He is an interesting candidate, for sure. I think that his charisma would be great for her campaign, but I don’t think (at this point, if I have to call it) that a Klobuchar/Beto ticket would be appealing enough for the progressive-independent spectrum.
@CrippledJerk @dillman_diana @jessied44 @amyklobuchar @thenation @BernieSanders Then we are allies, not enemies, so let’s treat each other with respect, eh? 		Who, if anyone, currently in politics do you follow? I don’t know Bernie personally, but I like what he has done for getting younger generations involved. I am more of an AOC activist.

@CrippledJerk @dillman_diana @jessied44 @amyklobuchar @thenation @BernieSanders Well, he has. He and other progressives have changed the party’s platform.

@toddwes04011384 @BartB75231815 @RepJayapal It’s the world we live in because of hate, not compassion. It’s not people seeking asylum or those defending them, it’s those in power tricking idiots into hating people because of where they are from. You are able to construct sentences, you should be smart enough to see it.
@toddwes04011384 @BartB75231815 @RepJayapal There shouldn’t need to be sides on Fascism. Anyone of measurable intelligence is able to tell that it is in no way good for society. Also, if you refer to this youth as “mental” and don’t cite any sources, I will just continue assuming that you are spewing unbacked rhetoric.

@ExposingLibsBS @KnorrMelvin @realDonaldTrump I study sociology and political sciences... trust me: Trump’s administration has a lot of red flags. And I am not a democrat, I disliked Hillary probably as much as you.
@ExposingLibsBS @KnorrMelvin @realDonaldTrump It’s not just “the left”, and it depends on the person. If we must put pending crimes aside, you’ve got to admit he just isn’t a likable person. For me, “not believing in” climate change is enough, but add divisive rhetoric, blatantly lying to the public, and racist scapegoating.
@ExposingLibsBS @KnorrMelvin @realDonaldTrump You’re not wrong. It’s just that 62M voted for him, and I know many people who did and now regret it, so I just doubt that that number has grown. But numbers won’t matter if he is indicted.

@USProgressives $75 a month is still a ridiculous amount for those of us who have no chronic health problems and already pay taxes. Universal Healthcare now!
@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump Literally no one wants to pay for your wall. Walls do not work. Stop dividing this country with racism and hate... Immigrants make America great, not your bullshit.

@chasestrangio @Ocasio2018 I feel you. @Ocasio2018 isn’t even technically my representative, but she represents me more than my elected officials. My mental health has improved knowing she is speaking for all of us.

@KamalaHarris @DianneFeinstein What is the plan for resources that new homes and buildings are to be built from? Is there a super-sustainable option other than lumber that is practical/possible to use?

@tristanbills @Walmart Walmart is the worst. Support a better company like Winco!
YES! Jenny or Shireen, we have a win-win! https://t.co/oLlXpdI3gq
@realDonaldTrump The American people are entirely sick of you constantly embarrassing us on the global scale. We all know that climate change is killing us, and you deny it as if it’s your syphilis. Stop lying and dividing! https://t.co/0YW93zl7aT
@utahsenate @UtahReps @GovHerbert @OrrinHatch @SenMikeLee The people of not only Utah, but the rest of the country, are watching you dismantle the will of the people. Defend democracy and leave Prop 2 as we voted for it! #Prop2 #MedicalCannabis
@Ocasio2018 @SenSanders You’re doing something right if all of the Nazi trolls are coming after you. The people have your back, and we are listening to your voice because it is ours ✊✊✊

As someone who grew up in the socioeconomic mess that his and Reagan’s administrations created, I will not remember him fondly. May this country’s dependency on fossil fuels die with him. https://t.co/kivVN4LrKD
@RashidaTlaib We see you as more than your identity, but as someone who is here to get shit done ✊✊✊
YES! Mayor Jenny Wilson has a great ring to it! https://t.co/rNnDcoCbfu
@JennyWilsonUT @BenMcAdams YES! You have my full support!
Love her or hate her, she is up for re-election next year, so if she isn’t representing us I have no doubt that California’s 12 district will vote her out. I am hopeful that she will listen to progressive voices in the House. https://t.co/jqQEktPSNg
Election integrity needs to be more of a focus than it is! https://t.co/fvCi2SH7Qi
@realDonaldTrump I’m sure we the people will see benefits from all of that money. What’s that, you say? More layoffs? I guess it will trickle down eventually...
@tristanbills YW 😘 Today? Let’s go with coffee ha
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump This was a stunt organized by your administration that cost us taxpayers $200M. Reports showed that the four soldiers hit by rocks were not harmed. Quit making a victim of the oppressors. No one is illegal.
@SenSanders @t1international I have been advocating for Universal Healthcare since I learned about it years ago, though I had no health issues. This November, just two months after going back to school, my cat (my baby) was diagnosed with diabetes. I struggle to afford his insulin, something needs to be done
@realDonaldTrump 600 (alleged) jobs after losing thousands in Ohio alone. Stop lying to and distracting the people that you were elected to represent. You are failing us worse than even your worst critics predicted.
