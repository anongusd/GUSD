There's this weird backlash that some folks have about Lou Reed. As though the idea that so many critics and smart people loved him, that they must all be in a conspiracy. Part of the reason for the skepticism is the perception that he was a bad singer. He was not. Just Listen.
In honor of Lou Reed's birthday, here's a ten song playlist for those of you who are either unsure where to start.. These are Lou songs that require very little effort by the listener. To me, he's one of the great writers of the 20th Century. Dig in. https://t.co/mCRTW2QDMr  c

5) So I continue to take the risks. Do the work. And I hope you'll join me and keep doing it yourself.
4) sometimes all you get from doing the work is doing the work, And whatever you learn during it. You might not know what you gained for years. But the traction, the momentum, the good feeling of finishing--in the end it matters more than the fear or disappointment.
3) I have never known whether anyone would care about anything I was working on when I was first working on it. All I have been able to measure is my own enthusiasm, commitment, intentions. And yes, this can set me up for disappointment. But that's part of being an artist.
2) how do I believe in myself? Here's the only answer I have found: by doing the work each day, I can build enough momentum to stop myself from asking the questions. Or at least to stop myself for the amount of time it takes to do the work,
1) I get this question fairly often: "how do I know if I am working on the right thing? How do I know if this idea is good enough? Will anyone care?" Here's what I think. You can never know. I can never know. So it goes to one of the central questions artist's face:

4) Dave and I were standing in Puerto Rico explaining all this. But all we got back was; Nah, the looks dope, he looks cool. And from there, each subsequent decision, to have him be cool, make the movie one more step further away from credible.
3) So he's in linen suits and Frank Sinatra hats. And looks like a model or a movie star, but not like a kid who left society to come work as a programmer and salesman for a poker site. The moment you meet him like that, you get the feeling that the world of the film is fake.
2) in sweat shirts, t-shirts, cargo shorts. We had done research, and found that to be true. May seem like a small thing. But the director and studio decided that since they had Justin Timberlake (who I like and who worked hard) they had to dress him like a star.
1) Folks often ask what we would have done differently on Runner Runner. Here's a simple example. And it goes right to why the film feels so phony and fraudulent in its depiction of the online gaming company in Costa Rica: wardrobe. We wrote that the characters dressed causally,
The reason I often mention/mock Runner Runner is that it represents a dividing line. The experience of making it was so painful--because I knew the film was going to be bad--that I promised myself that D and I would never cede creative control to a collaborator we didn't regard.

@jonathanmprince Yessir. You know I love you and vice. Tho I didn‚Äôt get the gift card so now I‚Äôm wondering.
@jonathanmprince oh, you know.
Gary Harris, Dennis Shields, Joe Hardy. Those are their names. Each was a remarkable person. Each was brilliant. And hilarious. And each one loved really hard. Gary died last January. Dennis 6 month ago. And Joe just died ten days ago. I miss em every single day.
4) To see or speak to them. Do it tonight. Now. Call or text someone you love, someone you have shared something memorable with. Even if it's been awhile.
3) I got to say goodbye to one of them, for which I am grateful. The other two went suddenly. Both knew I loved them, which gives some comfort. But, I swear, at 52 years old, I know this. Friends are valuable. And rare. And no matter how fast life gets, it is worth slowing down.
2) I haven't learned a ton from their deaths except this: there is never a wrong time to reach out to a friend, to say hello, to send a text, to check in. There is never a wrong time to tell a friend you love them.
1) In the last 13 months, I lost 3 real friends. Not people I was friendly with. Actual friends. These were guys I had spent real time with, had deep conversations with, laughed with, went through stuff with. There is a real hole where they used to be.
@sbz In fairness, the watch is right.

Writers are good at pointing out other writers' blind spots in a script.  Craig was reminded us that each scene needed to have a definite purpose, and to bring that purpose to the fore.

And I'll tell you, the single best notes I have ever gotten came from @clmazin, which is why I put up with his guff. He read the pilot of Billions and spent hours talking Dave and me through some crucial adjustments. No consultant could ever do that in the way he did. https://t.co/OStHXAdm3o
In 20+ years of writing professionally, the only notes that have made things truly better, platonically, have come from other professional screenwriters. And directors. Some network notes have been useful, too. But consultants and producers--rarely, rarely offer truly good notes.
I am in that very small band of people who hate the rat at the end of the Departed but LOVE the dancing sister at the end of Not Fade Away. 	(and love both movies)

@kylefandrews @ErikSchlittner @dbaerwald1 @scottmbeggs Kyle, the fact that you don't charge for your advice (if that's true) does make you seem more like an up and coming producer than a script consultant. That said, the evidence that you make scripts better will be in the movies that result. Not in you or anyone saying you did.

@kylefandrews dude, I was not here trying to make you, a human being, miserable. I spent a year making those vines which were all, basically, about getting voices out of writers' heads, so they could just fly. It's a passion of mine. And so you got a dose of it.
@kylefandrews @scottmbeggs again, man, it isn't personal. You decided to engage by bringing up the camera stuff. After I;d spent many posts on it. So I reacted. I wish you well, personally. I am good now.
@kylefandrews @scottmbeggs that's not a reason to trust your writing advice.
@kylefandrews @scottmbeggs read the blog post I just put up. This isn't personal. I don't believe in the idea of the kind of coverage you offer.
Look, @kylefandrews, I am not singling you out. You came here and told me I was wrong to say that writers shouldn't worry about rules. Here's what I wrote about your industry a while back.

@kylefandrews @scottmbeggs come on, dude. They may trust you. But the question is: should they?
@kylefandrews @shotbyfinnegan Kyle, you keep asking me why then you act upset that I post about your comments. The thing is: I don't believe you are an authority. There is nothing in your CV that tells me you are. I think the kind of coverage you are talking about is mostly harmful to writers.
@guilefreitas nope.
Not for disagreeing with me, Kyle. Folks disagree all the time on here. But I have a real problem with folks holding themselves out as experts about screenwriting tone, voice, rules. Especially when I've seen how dispiriting that sort of advice and critique can be. https://t.co/W8iukw7aBC

@Chrmdpoet They are not the real gatekeepers tho. Truly. An actual producer, an actual agent, an actual director is not gonna care. I know this because I have seen it.
let me go back in time and give up my career. https://t.co/RaLtNXN2Ll
So I just posted the Rounders screenplay to my blog. https://t.co/Epzy0ZPXcg. This is the script that Dave and I broke in with. We were much younger then, obv, but reading it, good or bad, I see why it stood out. happy to answer any questions about it.
@JohnMRinaldi Almost done. I use this like a walk around the block after writing a scene. PLUS, I just took an actual walk around the block.
And the Rounders¬†screenplay https://t.co/Wl0OsnB1S6
@EllenKilloran @JoannKBC @chrismcquarrie @mang0ld @rianjohnson Did you see my next tweet about how it's harder for women and poc? I understand and acknowledge it. That's why I mention Spike and Singleton and Callie Khoury. Because they wrote the truly undeniable. And so overcame the very real and impossible hurdles.
@JoannKBC @chrismcquarrie @mang0ld @rianjohnson This is a fair point. But I have read hundreds of scripts, More. The great ones do jump out. I don't imagine there is a She's Gotta Have it or Usual Suspects or Heavy just sitting there, unrecognized. Good scripts, sure. Ones that could be movies, yeah. Undeniable ones? Not many.
I won't put our first screenplay in the category with all these. But it did, by its language, its intensity, its level of detail, find a way to breath through. After it was rejected many times. None of this is easy. But it is doable if you work with crazy rigor and commitment. https://t.co/JbzS9Gn1vU
Yes. It is harder for people of color and women. But even so, Spike wrote She's Gotta Have It, Singleton wrote Boyz, Callie Khoury wrote Thelma. All were rejected, people tried to change em. But they were, essentially, undeniable. So the supposed rules didn't matter. https://t.co/RhK6aBWA7r
So I'm going to state one thing to screenwriters that needs to be said. And that is: if you write something truly undeniable, you will get past the gatekeepers. @chrismcquarrie wrote Usual Suspects. @mang0ld wrote Heavy. Nicole Holofcener wrote W&amp;T, @rianjohnson wrote Brick.
@Chrmdpoet Evaluations like that are basically useless tho. They have nothing to do w writing for the screen. Mostly scamsters and folks who know little.
@Glenn__Kenny @alrodz Better.
@alrodz @Glenn__Kenny Not that Suzanne, Al.
@Glenn__Kenny @paulsado I went paranoia and then to RnR Animal version of Rock and Roll, And I am so happy.
@Ebeckster @PhilGalfond @RunItOncePoker Gladly.
@paulsado @Glenn__Kenny Suzanne.
@paulsado @Glenn__Kenny yes. other folks could listen to I Love You, Susan. But nobody, not even you, Paul, is putting on Mistrial.
@paulsado @Glenn__Kenny quite so.
PKOE obv.
@Glenn__Kenny the real separator though is what's next? Tricky to complete this troika. One sec.
TFW you are writing on decide to put on Mistrial and I Love You Susan, and you know that it's entirely reasonable to imagine @Glenn__Kenny doing same. And no one else.
@WriteOrDieWifey we outline the whole season arc first, yes. Then we outline episode 1 and write episode 1.
outline takes much longer for sure. we write the draft in the span of a few days. https://t.co/eJCJaHQVt8

@GabbyDabbyDoo If you hear it, and think it'll translate, do it. I wouldn't put more than 2 or 3 at most in a script tho.
@AWorkmanWriter @zarqa yes. agreed. 100%. I always point to Michael Clayton which has a ton of stuff you can't film, but, somehow, it all got in the film.
I posted it in the same post. click the other link. https://t.co/SWdoFv1Mkn
@PodcastOTS yes
@FanFunDamian those are indications of revisions. It's the way we (and all shows and movies) track revisions. The first draft is the white draft. Then the next revisions are blue pages. They get inserted, unless more than 50% is changed. Then it becomes a full blue.
@PLenkov I will forever be in awe of people like you who can do 22 or more and more than one at a time.

@kashanacauley it really is!
@zarqa well, no, because that is in the outline, which is a summarizing document. Look at that scene in the script, to see what it because. 	BUT also yes. You can break that rule, sparingly. Like Gilroy does in Michael Clayton and I do in Solitary Man.
@GueuzeLambic that's a joke, right? I have always done this. Showrunner or not.
@AaronNagler @CoastalElite28 The supposed bullshit prohibition against it is not about licensing fees. It's about the idea that not everyone hears a song the same way or knows the song or something. But it's not a legit rule. Simply a style choice. Some GREAT writers never do it. Some do.
@SoulRebel365 Willie is the best guy on earth. Give him a hug for me, please.
You will note that the very first words of the script are "Tom Petty's Even The Losers plays, loudly." This--indicating music--is supposedly frowned upon by the gurus of screen and tv writing. https://t.co/7TR4wHACCG

@clmazin @AdamHorowitzLA @NickJAss @rianjohnson @chrismcquarrie @MCWCambridge @giveusthefunk @hankpena @TheJimBond @johnaugust @RealGDT It's so sick, Craig. Our first screenplay literally starts out with just voiceover on a black screen.
@BaileyCarlin we should make shirts !!!
@NickJAss @hankpena @rianjohnson @chrismcquarrie @MCWCambridge @clmazin @giveusthefunk @TheJimBond @johnaugust @RealGDT Sure thing. You've got this, man. The other folks in this thread, none of us know a thing. None of us are on the pulse of the business.
If your screenplay uses every convention that your teachers told you to avoid, but it creates an emotional response in the reader, keeps the reader engaged, pulls the reader through, makes the reader smile or cry, guess what? You'll be guest lecturing on why rules don't matter.
@NickJAss @hankpena @rianjohnson @chrismcquarrie @MCWCambridge @clmazin @giveusthefunk @TheJimBond @johnaugust @RealGDT this is wrong because the game is not to follow rules. it's to create an emotional response.
5) Not all authorities are bad. But don't grant someone that status because of mere position. Make sure they are actually an authority on what you want to do. Which is: to fly.
4) but without that fear, without that risk, how can their be success? All of us who have succeeded at this (at joining the circus) did it by taking risks, by making ourselves vulnerable, by jumping off the cliff.
3)I think part of the reason is: we want to cede responsibility. We want to cede fear. To some authority. To some permission giver. Because if there are no rules we are breaking, then our failure--to finish the pages, to succeed, is ours.
2)And all the screenwriters pretty much said: well, there are no rules. To which the aspirants responded: that's not what our teachers, coaches, guides, authority figures said. And it was clear the aspirants found much comfort in the idea of rules. And much fear in the other.
1)I think this has applications beyond screenwriting. There has been a long thread going about best practices in writing a screenplay. And some of the most successful screenwriters of the time responded. The premise of the question that started the convo was: which rules matter?
@NickJAss @rianjohnson @chrismcquarrie @MCWCambridge @clmazin @giveusthefunk @hankpena @TheJimBond @johnaugust @RealGDT we all wrote this way before.

once we started shooting Billions, and Anna was already in high school, there were some mornings I missed. But sometimes, I'd go to set at 6AM and then come back to walk her, and then go back to set. I considered it an honor and privilege. And now Im going to see her at college! https://t.co/2sRZODOAau
This one is easy. When Anna was 8, I made the decision that unless I was out of town, I would walk her to school every morning. And I did.

We wrote the pilot with Andrew. And created the show with him. He was an invaluable resource in that larval stage.

Love this question. 	The four of us love to sit on Sammy's bed, late at night if both kids happen to be staying at our house, and just make fun of each other and, like, eat cold cereal. Really late at night. https://t.co/eEuW7Xl0qK
Jocko will be on my podcast when we are next in the same place. Eager to do it. And I'd do his anytime if he asked. 	@jockowillink https://t.co/qzMLFWNFVg

I'm on a plane, heading westward, to see our daughter for her freshman year parents' weekend at college. Amy went out yesterday. So I'm here, a bit tired and bored. Therefore: Ask Me Anything. And I will do my best to answer. Ask about making Billions, about creativity, whatever.
@Lexialex @AndyAksen Yes. Thanks, Lexi.

@toadboy123 and I bet you're nicer, too.
The credulous reporting of the doctor's report is like the old Hollywood trades printing the press release. Come on, people. Eye ball it. Trump is 270LBS if he's a buck fifty. As a 6 foot, 237 pounder myself, I know. He's got 3 inches of height on me. And 40LBS.
In a strange twist, reading about Trump's blood pressure makes mine go up. 	If he's 120/70 at 243LBS, it's likely because the meds are doing their job.
@SammyKoppelman @BaileyCarlin ON THE SUBWAY! WITH HIS HANDS. BAILEY, look how they have massacred my boy.
@SammyKoppelman @BaileyCarlin I basically like every Sammy K tweet. But this one isn't getting that heart filled in.
@SammyKoppelman @BaileyCarlin Who has stolen my son's body and brain?
Yes. The Girlfriend Experience, which David and I wrote with Steven Soderbergh, who directed it, was ALMOST ENTIRELY IMPROVISED. That was the intent the whole time. We only wrote a very detailed outline. 	But that is the only one in my career. https://t.co/XXGS6nTfe5
@Doug_Duke Hah. I love the film!
@FerraroOnAir Ah, yes, people like to believe the actors are making it up. But that is almost never the case. Out of the 13 movies and countless hours of tv I've made, that has been the rare exception.
@BaileyCarlin you do. lean into it. this is humanity. know it. love them anyway. but be a little disgusted.
@BaileyCarlin Sammy will not be able to deal with this. It might break him. @SammyKoppelman
@BaileyCarlin my like is really me puking.
@FerraroOnAir Joe, this is reading like gibberish to me. Of course actors do tons of stuff we don't write, with their bodies and eyes and inflection. The questions were about dialog. Rounders has 5 lines of improvised dialog. All by Edward Norton. Some comedies have improv. Most don't.
@FerraroOnAir they don't want to do that, Joe. Not how it works. If John had an idea, we would ALWAYS hear it.
I know Hail Caesar is considered a minor work for the Coen Brothers. But moment to moment, scene to scene, it is a marvel.

@JohnSpavale Nope
Some actors are also good writers, are also good at improvising. But one has little to do with the other. https://t.co/byyNyhXnch
3 people have asked me a version of this: ‚Äúyour actors are so great. Why don‚Äôt you just have them improvise the dialog?‚Äù So, a thing that makes an actor great is being able to embody and be present in and with someone else‚Äôs words and creation. They SEEM to be making it up.

@MeetInTheLobby @theHobbyStudios that arrogance, that command climate that he gives Heydrich, his certainty and need for power. Chilling. Tucci totally chilling, too. And Firth.
This would be a very bad result for me, though. https://t.co/ARkpXZoYAK
And I'll go one further. A sure sign that we haven't yet solved a story or dialog problem is if we disagree about what it should be. Very often, what it means is: we haven't come up with the good enough idea yet. So we keep moving. https://t.co/zXfSkwrxgo
You would be shocked at how rarely that happens. It becomes clear, quickly, which idea works best. One aspect worth mentioning: David and I have been like brothers since we were about 15 years ago. We have long ago learned to keep ego out of these creative conversations. https://t.co/sXsPkIjkzj
@_MichaelGaston @grimmcommishsho I understand why that happens. But David and I love and respect actors WAY too much. The latest they have EVER gotten a script is a week out. We do change scenes sometimes, after table read, but we warn everyone if that is happening.
@grimmcommishsho It‚Äôs how we‚Äôve done every season. We write 6 ahead of time. Then outline the rest. And finish each 10 days before the episode shoots.
@DHannum8 @patrick_oshag Yeah, we plan to keep making the show for a while. That's why I stressed SEASON finale in my posts.
@jockowillink Yeah, I spent a couple days with Jocko a few weeks back, and have exercised almost every day since. Tonight, I really didn't want to go. Full day of work. Cold out. And then I was like, damnit. Jocko. And I went.

@Jandies1 The room helps break the season story.
Dave and I pick all the music. https://t.co/vfoGKSnhTU
@plinytheelder_t I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs close to true. The show got darker and darker in seasons 2/3. Especially for Wendy.
@PaulHaavardsrud We have written on different continents from one another. But time in same room to focus on story is useful.
@zarqa We don‚Äôt. We learned a long time ago how to talk through story in a way that doesn‚Äôt lead to us wanting different things.
@vailini1 Pretty random. If a run of scenes really go together, then maybe one of us will do all of it. But no real plan. We can both write any of it.
No spoilers. https://t.co/ZPUpGfLyW5
@Salted2 No actors are involved in the process at all. The writers' room is writers and writer's assistants who are also writers.
@MaryMarbach No. We don't have to think about it anymore. As you suspect, the rhythm of the stories just makes sense to us in that way, now, Mary. Also, I havent forgotten about the mug.
we had written between 5 and 6 episodes before the start of shooting. https://t.co/s9MZb1RErM
@alexanderbasek we have a lot before cards. We have already broken the season and so know a great deal about the big events.
@Salted2 Our writers and everyone in the writers' room.
The actors get the scripts about 10 days  before we start shooting each episode. We do a table read about 7 days out, and they always have it at least a night or two before that. They don't really get hints. But we do sit with Damian, Paul and Maggie at beginning of season. https://t.co/46vyFUY0eV
7) any questions about any of this? ask away.
6)And then we give it to our team to read and give us notes. We do those. Then give to network. So, today, we started the scene writing part of episode 12 of season 4. Within a week, the script will be done. The director of the episode will get it on his first day of prep.
5) When he finishes, the other guy does a pass rewriting, adding, cutting. And then we sit in a room and do a final pass, going through any rough spots or structural shifts that seemed tricky.
4)Once the scenes are drafted, and we have each gone through our own scenes a few times, so they basically work, one of us combines the work into one document. We rotate who does it. And that person does the first glue pass, rewriting the whole thing for flow.
3) Then we each go off and write our scenes. During that time, we are talking a lot--texting, emailing, about structural changes or specific runners that we might invent or add.
2) Once we have the outline done, which means it flows, feels like a story, has detailed versions of each scene, including some dialog, one of us goes through and puts our initials throughout, so we are each assigned half the scenes.
1)People often ask how David and I write together. So I'll tell you the way it works. First we outline. This happens in conversation, with index cards. Then we write the beats into a Final Draft document. From there, we send the document back and forth, adding, cutting, changing.
What a wonderful and strange feeling to be writing the script for the last episode of season 4 of #Billions. Dave and I finished the outline Monday. And are now writing the scenes. It's gonna be a good one. Can't wait for you to see this whole season.
The other day, I was talking about watching the first season of The Real World. And I said: I think I was a senior in college.	I was off by 4 years! 	Memory of certain cultural signifiers isn't always exactly accurate. Doesn't mean anyone is/was lying. https://t.co/Mv5LBT8ZSY

In news you will care about more: I think I know what songs are gonna start and finish the last episode of season 4 of Billions! And I am real excited about 'em.
5) Ok. Back to movies, tv, music and all the other fun bullshit.
4) When I hear the language about immigrants coming from this administration and its friends, to me it sounds the same as Juden. They are being other-ed. They are being lied about. And they are being destroyed. I hate talking about this stuff. But I hate the fact of it more.
3) And that's not hyperbole. Some "we" is next. Even if next is in 50 years. So when someone says, "Hitler's problem is that he tried to expand out of Germany," we can't just laugh it off. We have to say: no, his problem was racial, religious, sexual preference cleansing.
2) This has nothing to do with Israel, with zionism, with religion, even, really, What it has to do with is fascism, nationalism, the idea that the other is often, through history, herded together and destroyed. We must be vigilant for EVERY marginalized group. Because we're next
1)What American Jews know--even atheist American Jews like me--is that at almost any moment we could face an existential crises. My parents were both alive when Jews were being slaughtered in Europe. I was raised with an awareness that no matter how we looked, we were other.
In light of the Candace Owen's disaster of a statement on Hitler, may I recommend that all of us watch the movie Conspiracy this month? It's 2 hours of masterful acting (Tucci! Firth! Branagh!), great writing and the real horror of these men talking--just talking--final solution.

@DamenNorton Both great. For me, Tabloid tells The story of the times.
Needless to say to any of the producers who follow me: if you get this book and want to make the thing, let‚Äôs go. https://t.co/TrDVHOmSCv
American Tabloid by James Elroy is maybe THE novel about the last century. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve always wished we could make a miniseries from it. The book is about ALL of this blackmail, power, corruption stuff. And about the dark soul of the American male political animal.
Blackmail like this has long been used by powerful men (mostly always men).  Hoover used it. And loaned his resources to other powerful men. Willingness to be exposed, to be embarrassed, to be publicly frail, is the only thing that renders them ineffective.
But it is so scary that it takes the world‚Äôs richest person to be strong enough, to think he can weather the storm. Most of the rest of us‚Äîeven those w platforms‚Äîwould be hard pressed to make such a stand. That‚Äôs the evil of The Nat‚Äôl Enquirer. https://t.co/jr5fPXCimK
As a young man, the Howard Hughes stuff always seemed exaggerated. How could so many people bend to his will? How could he really blackmail such famous and powerful folks? Fact is, public shame, loss of job, works if we let it. And we usually let it. That‚Äôs why I applaud Bezos.

@JESnowden Been thinking about this possibility all week. Any real chance it happens ?
@djpaddyb1 @PatnaudeJude @WorkHardNapHard @SHO_Billions @DavidLevien @andrewrsorkin No, no, no. We are just having fun. Let's not gang up.
@PatnaudeJude All best, sir. I am just having fun on a Sunday!
I grew up watching David Mamet plays and movies. And Scorsese's movies. And in New York. 	We curse a ton. 	Now, Jude, this may mean that my ability to write dialog is blunted. I'll accept that. Someday, maybe I'll become proficient with words. Until then, I'll muddle along. https://t.co/q53AliRSb6
@JimmyRobertsNBC Same
Well this is about as fun as a Sunday ought to be. https://t.co/f9KLaJksLk
I‚Äôll fucking keep that in mind. https://t.co/5SRJ9MiUUX
You can just picture Trump standing there with his arms crossed as innocent woman after innocent woman in Salem was drowned. ‚ÄúGuess she wasn‚Äôt a witch. Okay, next witch into the water!‚Äù
The best part of Trump constantly saying ‚Äúwitch hunt‚Äù is that you just know that if he were in Salem, he‚Äôd have been the guy stoking the fires and yelling that these  women needed to be burned at the stake.
@akjakalope @realDonaldTrump Same. Truly same.
@BrianStack153 @jonwurster Is it streaming on Amazon? I will watch asap. I have more Dead stuff than either of you, love Jerry‚Äôs voice/writing/playing but not a deadhead.
@AlaskanTush @robertellis_ @JoshuaHedley Yes. I‚Äôd saved his last album after hearing one song and loving it. But hadn‚Äôt got around to listening. Getting in now. Mostly cuz he likes wrestling.
Ellis is not nearly as well known as he should be. He‚Äôs a great songwriter and singer. @robertellis_ https://t.co/SjEZ94La20

@reallisa Yes. The question was about the supporting cast !!
@brooke You are my friend and can text me. But yes, often it is 5AM. 	Like yesterday, I wanted to take a soul cycle led zeppelin class at 6AM because I had to be on set after that. So I did it. 	Today I slept until almost 6 tho.
I'm gonna go to sleep. Great doing the q/a with you all. I will look at the rest of the questions tomorrow and answer what I can. Thanks.
We basically wrote Wags for David Costabile and definitely created Mafee with Dan Soder in mind. The others happened though the course of casting and working with actors. https://t.co/Tl1q638DtJ

@jeremiahjw Dave and I did. Along with Adam Perlman.
I didn't stop meditating. I meditate every single day. https://t.co/OVwyvVtGpF
@nicolestockdale Thanks! 	I'll try to post a list on my blog. 	I love Murakami, Hemingway, Maugham, Auster's first bunch of books, Salinger, Pam Houston, so many more.
I love when geniuses ask me questions. 		The Morning Pages really helped me figure that out. So did trying other kinds of writing, like stand up and songs. 		Mostly, though, I just loved movies and tv and quoted them all the time. https://t.co/DFUo74O9d1
Sometimes, I can tell what will land. Other times I am surprised. The thing of it is, I have a great creative partner. And it's his reaction that matters to me the most. I am basically always trying to amuse Dave. As he amuses me. https://t.co/yCPLcYH5rl
You can have more than a pep talk. You have my empathy and sympathy. And my wishes for this uncertainty to pass and for you to find the next thing. 	I won't pretend to have an answer other than this: control what you can, that is, your own mindset. And exercise. Again, so sorry. https://t.co/5AUxKfFOeg
This one. https://t.co/eu9antwNhJ

I'll try to post an outline on my blog next week, so you can see. https://t.co/QvOg5awyNT
I wake up. Put on water for coffee. Meditate. Drink coffee. Do Morning Pages. If I have time, I go exercise (Soul Cycle lately) or take a walk. https://t.co/3d9f7FXuFq
@Theo_Dimarhos yes
Do Morning Pages like in Artist's Way. And read War Of Art by Pressfield. 		You are just scared to finish. So you have to start writing in a journal without thinking, you have to just produce pages without worrying about content. Get over the fear. Dive in. https://t.co/7V6wyOs9Wi
The real answer is: I don't consider anything I watch or read a guilty pleasure. Like: If I watch New Japan Pro Wrestling, why watch it through a jaundiced eye. I'd rather just take in the storytelling, see how it makes me feel. 	A straightforward thing I read is Tools Of Titans. https://t.co/WDaZFN9Kww
We were lucky enough to have Ethan Coen come to the editing room on Solitary Man. He said: You should cut this one paragraph, this ending to a scene. I said: but that's the scene that made me want to make it. He said: That's the ladder that got you to roof. Now your here. https://t.co/hd51CiompN
I know the answer to this. 	Dave and I referenced the event Art Basil. 	And a note came back: Why are you introducing this Art Basil guy so late in the script? https://t.co/iJ6Tklf6Na

Everything you see is something we (the writers, actors, directors, editors) have thought about, made the choice to show you. Your interpretation is entirely up to you. https://t.co/sSjMkj3zuO
David and I work really closely with Allison Estrin our casting director. And, on the pilot, with Avy Kaufman. And then we also talk to Showtime a ton. 	As for Axe and Chuck: David and I knew Paul from The Illusionist. And David Nevins at Showtime new Damian from Homeland. https://t.co/5bH6R8uIQ4
You have to just know that it makes you feel good to do it, that you are working with rigor and focus to get better at it, that you can track improvement. You can't control what you can't control. https://t.co/6rDvv1zYub
Yes. https://t.co/eHdHgJgwJU
Dave and I got to start a career. That's the payment that really mattered. https://t.co/JZAyy9wEth
How do we want to define metal tho? 	Like, is Motorhead metal? 	Is Guns N Roses metal? 	What about AC/DC? 	The least known great metal song is Swords And Tequila by Riot. https://t.co/ExnjvINZNu

It's not like New York metro is a big travel center. The President has to be among the dumbest individuals to hold high office--any high office-- in the history of our country. 	There are county commissioners who have Trump by like 40 IQ points. And 200 empathy points. https://t.co/My36JLf59p
We are literally turning into Yakov Smirnov's Russia. 	What a country. https://t.co/My36JLf59p

This is true: if you want to do risky work, creative work,  work that scares you, you have to learn to say no to all sorts of things. And the people you tell no might not understand. That‚Äôs ok. Later, when you‚Äôve done the work, they will not only understand, they‚Äôll applaud you.
Sometimes we think it‚Äôs selfish to pursue our art (or dream business or craft) because it pulls us away from family/friends/the usual. But I have found that doing the work makes us kinder, less selfish, less bitter.  Because we get closer to our best selves. And then share it.
@jeremiahjw @joshhhsays @DavidLevien Yah. That‚Äôs a good one. I remember when Dave and I wrote it. We knew it was gonna fuck folks up. Shooting it was kind of brutal. But our editor Marnee Mayer did a brilliant job of finding it.

I never thought of it that way. I don't think it's empowering to think of it that way. Because it adds stakes to the thing, loads it up.

It doesn‚Äôt always work quickly. You may go through many buyers. You may even have to abandon pitching it and just spec it. Like @HIGHzurrer did w Arrival. Listen to him talk about it on my podcast. You‚Äôll end up inspired. https://t.co/h2xUQmKPY0
Pitching is all about getting an emotional reaction, not an intellectual reaction. The goal is to share the feeling you have about the material. To make the buyer catch that feeling. https://t.co/h2xUQmKPY0
When I think of the pitches David and I sold, I‚Äôm certain we almost never mentioned genre. We just told the version of the story that excited US in a way that enlisted the listener. We always use humor. We always try to transfer our enthusiasm to the buyer. https://t.co/h2xUQmKPY0

Wonderful thread here about our process making moments on tv. What Rhea is describing on her show happens on ours, too. https://t.co/WlWlbVpzoz
@macwrites Chet tho!
8) the weekend is a great time to retrench. To remind ourselves why we want to do this work. So remind yourself. And then do the work. Do. The. Work.
7) then I made the conscious decision that they didn‚Äôt control how I felt. And that if I ended the day with more work done than I started it, that was success. As long as they didn‚Äôt stop me from writing, working, then they didn‚Äôt win.
6) at first, I, too, was laid low by rejection. I, too, believed that the gatekeeper‚Äôs reaction to the work was a final judgement. Meant that not only the work, but I, myself, had little worth in the creative world.
5) but more than that, this is the part where I tell you that you need to find the way you shake off the bad news. For me, it‚Äôs morning pages, meditation, family, walking.
4) this is the part where I tell you Rounders was rejected by every agent in town, and every buyer who saw it except one. That The Illusionist took 2 1/2 years to set up, that we were told it was uncommercial, wouldn‚Äôt get made. Wouldn‚Äôt sell. Then it did 96 million worldwide.
3) it doesn‚Äôt have to linger. Allow yourself to feel it. If you need a day, two, a week, fine. But then, remember this: you don‚Äôt need their permission to do the work. You didn‚Äôt need their permission to start. And: you don‚Äôt need their permission to keep going.
2)first: it hurts. Even if you tell yourself it‚Äôs not you, even if you know all the stories of people getting rejected finding a way to succeed. Getting told no, by those that are in positions to grant your dreams, sucks. But...
1)Let‚Äôs talk a little about rejection.

@Liv_Boeree No. How To Actually Change Your Mind is the one I am reading over and over. The maths, man, the maths.
17) (Iunderstand the ways in which it was easier for me than for most. I was raised with money. I was a white man at a time when that gave me a huge leg up. I had no college debt. I made money young. But none of that stops you from doing. It just made it easier for me).
16) And I want you to know that you are smart enough. That the teachers didn't know. That the echoes of their voices don't matter. And that if you show up each day to do the work, you won't need anyone else to tell you anything. You will just be, by virtue of doing, an artist.
15) Shortly thereafter, I stumbled into a poker club, called Levien, told him there was a movie we should write. And that became Rounders. I tell you this because I see from the questions/ comments you ask that many of you are as scared as I was.
14) They gave me a ritual, a beginning of the creative day, a way to get beyond perfectionism. They made me realize that no one can anoint you as an artist. You have to do the work, each day, and then, maybe, you just become one. By doing.
13) And so, finally, my best friend @Davidlevien gave me Julia Cameron's book, The Artist's Way, and I found myself in it. I found what to call my fear and inability to work. And I started doing morning pages, each day. These pages unlocked and unblocked me.
12) And I realized that being blocked led to something dying in me. And that like any other kind of death, this death would be toxic, and the toxicity, the bitterness would leach out of me onto those I loved. I didn't want that to happen.
11) Soon after that, our first child was born. Looking at him, I knew I didn't want to be the kind of father who would lie, who would tell him he could be anything he wanted as long as he tried, if I, myself, hadn't tried to live it, too.
10) And then, months later, would wake up in the middle of the night, try again, delete it, throw it out, wake up hating myself. But somewhere in there, my wife, Amy, told me she knew I was a writer. That I should try it. That I deserved to try it.
9) This inability to finish work, this giving up, this quitting, felt like suicide to me. Led to self hatred. Even as I found success professionally, in a related field, but not as an artist, I would sometimes try to write, and then quickly give up.
8) But I truly thought that I didn't have the stuff really creative people had. And I was, secretly, a perfectionist. So if I couldn't spin gold right away when I tried to write something, I wasn't able to finish it.
7) Now, I don't want to lie or be falsely humble: I knew I was a smart person, or smart enough, and I knew I had a way with words--that is, I could write an essay or paragraph and do it in a memorable, easy to read way.
6) And, although I always felt great kinship with artists, I didn't think I could be an artist either. I always thought artists were predetermined, special, picked out ahead of time, anointed.
5) I acted in high school plays and assistant directed, but again, not once did a teacher or fellow student suggest I should try and make a career as a performer or writer or creator in the arts.
4) Still, I struggled, badly, in school. If a subject was boring to me, I wouldn't do the work in the class. Couldn't, really, so, instead, I would read novels during class, hiding them behind the book I was supposed to be dealing with.
3) Eventually, I taught myself to read very quickly. I didn't develop some kind of technique, but I learned a kind of hyper focus--the entire world would disappear when I read which allowed me to read fast and comprehend a great deal.
2) I was also a late reader. I had a big verbal vocabulary. A gift for remembering/using words. But I didn't really become a reader until the summer after 4th grade. My mom gave me the book Tales Of A Fourth Grade Nothing. I stayed up all night to read it. Then read all summer.
1) No teacher ever singled me out and told me I should consider a career as a writer. Come to think of it, no fellow student ever did either.
@Liv_Boeree you got me reading Yudkowsky a while back. Now I am borderline obsessed with his ideas about rationality. I have so little math background that I have to constantly translate it all into words I can understand. But totally worth it. Thanks.

I have zero tolerance for it. Now, I may end up with some clinkers in there, but I never leave em on purpose. David and I grind and grind on that stuff. Not on the first draft. But before anyone else reads. And when we do table reads, we are listening super closely for that. https://t.co/bgi7S9pBMB

None. I wasn't on set for that one. Thrilled that Dave and I wrote the greenlight draft of the movie and got credit on it. 	But the director of that film had very little use for us after that. https://t.co/81qrcEXFLv

David and I outline together and then write the scenes separately. With a rewrite, once we've talked it out, one of us would go first, do a quick pass, then the other would rewrite that, then the first person would go again. And then a final day or two together. https://t.co/rcOy9rMd3C

City of Thieves. Billy Phelan's Greatest Game. 	I am reading Stegner's Angle Of Repose, and absolutely loving it. But it's slow, deep, requires me to put it down every 15 pages to think and feel. So I can't say it's a can't miss book for everyone. The above two are. https://t.co/57kCJmfTkw
@Ebeckster @SHO_Billions It's really hard to do that, I think. My wife, @AmyLKoppelman, pulled it off. She had a great writing partner in Paige Dylan, and spent years getting it right.
Writing all the idea down, all the time. And listening, closely, to my inner voice. https://t.co/j7S0NFSq5s
I try and leave myself open, as open as possible to following my curiosity and obsessions. I take note of them. Dave and I talk about all of each other's. And then, from a practical standpoint: I journal--Morning Pages--every day. And meditate twice a day. https://t.co/pjRbEfijpq
I'll never, ever give spoilers on here, folks. https://t.co/whq7eX3xTc
It's one of the least intellectualized part of the process. We watch closely. We allow ourselves to feel what the actor is bringing, how they hit off the part. Our casting director Allison Estrin really helps in conversation. I will say this: David and I agree  99.9% of the time. https://t.co/6J2VEN1WW7
If you want to ask me anything as we head into the new year, go ahead. Happy to answer as many as I get to. About creativity hacks or screenwriting or movies or making @SHO_Billions or essay writing or whatever you want.

11) I can't promise you that your results will be the same as mine. But I can promise this: I started feeling better while I was doing the work, not when the results came in. Long before Showtime bought the pilot, I had re-found my groove. You can, too. I just know it. Happy 2019
10) I wish I could communicate to you how sad I was in the fall of 2013. How lost I felt. And how angry I was at myself for feeling that way--I had a loving family, I had enough money that I didn't have to take a day job, I had already made many movies--but still, I did.
9) I decided to believe them. As you should believe me. Small steps. Consistent effort. Yes, the deck is stacked against you. Yes, they will think you are crazy. Yes, it's harder to get a fair shake if you are a woman or person of color. But all you can control is effort.
8) This is also when I started my podcast. So I could ask other artists how they stared down defeat, how they kept going when everyone told them they were done, crazy, not special. To a person, they said they just decided that the only thing they could control was effort.
7) That fall was the closest I had ever come to accepting defeat, to accepting my best days were behind me, to admitting that I might never get past the failures of the previous year. But something in me knew I had to press on.
6) I couldn't have known then that the thing we were working on (the Billions pilot script) would change my entire life. But I swear to you I did know, each time I flipped on the office lights, that small victories mattered, that small steps forward erased the backward steps.
5) From my apartment to the office. And that each physical step felt like hope. If I made it across, that meant I had gotten myself out of bed, that meant I was trying, that meant I hadn't yet been counted out.
4) 5 years ago, that was me. But I spent December in New York, at home, and at my office, alone, and I wrote a little bit each morning. And then a little more. And then I'd send it to Dave to work on at night.  I remember walking through Central Park in the freezing cold.
3) Every artist I know has felt lost, beaten, let down by the business or themselves or both at the same time. Every one has considered they might not be up to it, might not be good enough, smart enough, deep enough, tough enough.
2) There's a lot I don't know. A lot of answers I don't have. But one thing I am sure of: the smallest, consistent steps lead us forward. And if you take a few steps backward, take a few more forward. And then a few more.
1) If you're looking back at 2018 today and feeling bad about the things you failed at, the things that didn't go as well as you'd hoped they would, at the ways in which you let yourself, your dreams, your ideals down, know this: you are not alone. And you are not defeated.

@chrismcquarrie It's a minute 42 seconds.
@chrismcquarrie you get me dm with that clip, kid?
@Brandon__Boyce @WriterLe @chrismcquarrie can I give you a maybe. I think the multiple players involved, plus the true story, make it less open to Derrida-like interpretations. Themes yes. Of course. Ideas even. But the facts of it? What if he'd shot the guys in there talking about killer Karen, but cut for time?
@AD70144414 he was murdered by the Rosatto brothers.
@Brandon__Boyce @WriterLe @chrismcquarrie I understand the deconstructionist point of view about how the creator's vision doesn't matter. But it might be different with a film, since perhaps MS communicated this to the actors and DP, in order to create the effect. There might be an actual truth of the moment.
@birbigs There ya go! Nailed it.
@1970Bing 2nd Ave, original location, then Katz's, then, a long, long way down, a tie between Stage and Carnegie. 	Pastrami Queen is good and still open.
@jchou321 @amandamull No. We slice fruit and bread and other goodies for fondue.
@robfreeborn A reply to a question about fondue! Maybe the original poster deleted his question.
@amandamull And I know that‚Äôs not fancy. But it‚Äôs the dinner at home part I co-sign. (The burgers are always our version of White Castle).

@RickRaouwse I believe so, yes.
But Tommy wasn't gonna get made. That was a ruse to get him relaxed and easy to kill. https://t.co/UBQj7Xpe4d
There were people who saw the beef between Batts and Tommy. And Tommy's rep was such that it was no leap to figure out what happened. No way to tie the other two to the event. Plus, Jimmy really earned. Tommy is the easy sacrifice. https://t.co/u9bezby4wE
@StarleeKine yesterday, people threw a couple my way, about why Henry or Jimmy did what they did.
Jimmy was not a made man, though, because he had Irish blood. He needed Tommy to get made, so their crew would be protected. https://t.co/BmdgSqY1up

@CJKarch more questions than theories.
@MeetInTheLobby @AnnaKoppelman yes.
If you have any Godfather/Godfather 2 theories you wanna test out on me, I'm game. Same w Goodfellas.
And I am even more certain that Michael was basically convinced Fredo was the betrayer by the time the two of them finished at the cafe. Pacino definitely plays it that way, not wanting to believe it, but seeing clear his brother was lying to him. https://t.co/tYyOfGLbQN
after yesterday's discussion on here, I decided to watch Godfather 2 from beginning to end. So that's what @AnnaKoppelman and I just did. This time through, I was struck by how Coppola let that entire Hagen/5 Angels scene play in a two shot behind the gate. Perfect film. Best.
@RodPicott He‚Äôs top 5 for sure. 	But Joni was the best. Maybe ever, behind Dylan.

@jptaylorsg I never would have said the Farrar thing if I hadn‚Äôt written that Billions scene.
9) So read something. Will ya?	End.
8) A friend asked me today, if I wanted those novel recommendations to clear my head. To take my mind off my show, Billions. And yes, sure, that, too. But what I wanted and needed more was to dive deep. To risk being that unsettled. To remind myself of my brief place here. Now.
7) And it forces you to grapple with impermanence. With death. And its ramifications. And asks you this question: if we‚Äôre all gonna die, what is worth living for? Who is worth living for? What will you do with your time.
6) But now I know what he meant. And it goes to the heart of why fiction matters. Fiction stirs you up in a way nothing else can. It forces you inward, then forces your eyes to see the world around you, too, clearly, if for only a moment. Forces you to see who hurts and why.
5) somewhere in there, I happened to meet one of the world‚Äôs best novelists. He was 20 years older than me, about the age I am now, and he said: it gets harder to read fiction as you get older. I didn‚Äôt understand it. Couldn‚Äôt conceive of it.
4) About rare kindnesses. About meanness.
3) But being engaged w fiction all the time‚Äîserious books, less serious books‚Äîmeant that I was in a constant conversation w myself about what mattered. Not what mattered in the instant. But what mattered inside, over the long haul. About the consequences of actions.
2)At the time, I wasn‚Äôt thinking about its utility, the ways in which it shaped or influenced me, any more than I‚Äôd think about how playing basketball 4 days a week kept me in some semblance of shape.
1)Some thoughts on the value of reading fiction: When I was in my 20s/early 30s, I read 3 or 4 books a week. Mostly fiction. This sounds like a lot to non-writers. But it‚Äôs not. It never felt like work. Or if it did, I was on to the next book.

@PDHerrlinger @MISEGR I will read that book in January.
@ReligionTroll I watched it and really dug it.
We do none of that at all. We never even think in terms of acts. I mean that literally. David and I never, ever talk to each other about what act we are in. We are just trying to make the thing entertaining, and say the things we want to say. https://t.co/XlUpmTAPOf
Better answer: as show runners, Dave and I are responsible for all the content you see and hear on the show. We hire the amazing professionals/artists with whom we collaborate. And we empower them to do their thing. But ultimately, it's all our responsibility. https://t.co/avpJqnpcxf
Dave and I oversee casting (our amazing casting director Allison Estrin has impeccable taste). No one is cast without our approval. And we always include the network, too.  The showrunner (Dave and me) is also responsible for editing the show, with our editors. And for shooting. https://t.co/avpJqnpcxf

I started reading Angle Of Repose by Wallace Stegner. It's stunning. But it requires you to put it down every 10 pages or so to collect yourself. Helluva novel. https://t.co/xw0CPQwxUI
If you listen to David and me on The Writer's Podcast on nerdist network, we tell the whole story. But...I have to admit...Rounders was our first screenplay. https://t.co/gZauIwapgg

@Felicitykate That tells me you are trying. Which is great. The rewards are worth it.
@URwithCS I was never great. Played varsity tennis, but was not a star. But have always loved the sport. And I worked at US Open as a kid.
@Bryna1 The most recommended book is Station Eleven tho. By far.
Along with my creative partner, @Davidlevien, I pick all the songs. Spend an inordinate amount of time focused on it. I keep tens of playlists going for each season. And often play the music while I'm writing. https://t.co/3YtdlT97EN
It constantly evolves. I make a conscious effort to continue to dive in, to learn, to explore. 	One example : I always thought I hated opera. But lately, I've come to love a couple of operas (beginner operas, Tosca and Turandot). https://t.co/qwWc5Eu0t3
@ShawnDonnelly9 Maybe ! Check back after new year. Link me to a favorite episode.
We write in order. Though we outline the season ahead of time. And we never split up tasks in that way. We are all responsible for all of it. 	David and I are the final pen on all scripts. And often the first pens, too. https://t.co/qlO1dhnyYy

I was a blocked, frustrated writer, had just turned 30, was worried I'd be a bad dad and husband if I let the artistic impulse die--I feared that death of creativity would turn toxic, and leach out into those I loved. And then @DavidLevien gave me Artist's Way. https://t.co/arakgKFyPb

We researched it for about a year. Then outlined it. From the moment we started actually writing the script pages, it took us about 4 months. We loved the story we were telling, the world it was set in, the characters. So it wasn't hard to be patient. https://t.co/5Kdj0prTfR

@RogueNotary @brianduroche @HiggsMacro I loved that book, Stoner, but I did find it crushing. The distance between who he wished he was and who he could be, and the way it turned him, man, it killed me.
You have all been so helpful to me--and to each other--on the book recommendation thing. Thanks and keep em coming. 	And: I am on a plane now. Happy to answer any questions any of you have about anything. You can ask about creativity, #Billions, podcasting, screenwriting, whatev.

@tommytomlinson Maybe that's what I'll ask you on the pod.
@cjchilvers tho I was thinking earlier tonight about the difference in the relationship between Rush/their fans and VH/their fans. Something about Rush's earnestness made the bond somehow deeper. And about Rush's intention with the music. Even though Van Halen was my favorite band as a kid,
@cjchilvers Nah. I don't do the gossipy thing.
@Felicitykate I've listened to them for like 40 years.
if there's something about Geddy or Rush you wish had been asked before, let me know. I'm gonna do my show. And stay in the lane I stay in, but if someone suggests something I haven't thought of, about the why or how of it all, Ill ask it. https://t.co/pyqsmmMxYa
Ok, fuck it, I'll say this; I am interviewing Geddy Lee for the podcast tomorrow morning. And it's a little heavy to me. Was 14 the first Rush show I saw. Have seen em 7 times. Which, I know, doesn't even make me a Rush fan, to Rush fans. But I am a lifelong Rush fan.

@haarsteve Thanks, Steve. You know we feel same about you.
@infinitesimull @Eden_Eats It's a lifelong battle. But learning to take your own council, and that of the ones who love you well, and to tune out the bad voice echoes of those you don't respect but who somehow have sway--this is, to me, a worthy aim. It leads to real kindness to self and others. I think.

To me, the feeling of being comfortable in your own skin is the hardest to attain yet most worthwhile kind of success. And it doesn't come from following someone else's precepts or schedules or ideas about how you should be living your life.
I am an early riser. 	But I really don't like the use of the word "success" here. By whose definition? Is this financial success? Innovative success? Success at being kind? John Wooden's definition, about the feeling of satisfaction that comes from knowing you tried your best? https://t.co/WSNrQkp4NK
@scott_tobias Sure. I saw Tupelo once. On 1st ave in nyc. 50 people in the room. To me, the sadness, the weariness, in Farrar‚Äôs voice just wrecks me. So despite Tweedy‚Äôs genius, I land harder on Jay.

@dbaerwald1 @tftalbott But, like, for instance, David Koepp wrote out all the mission impossible sequences. And Tony Gilroy wrote out many of them in the first three Bourne movies.
@ErikaDieg yes
But here's the thing though: I think Jeff Tweedy absolutely GREAT! He is one of the best. I just like when he plays off other musicians, like Jay Farrar and Jay Bennett. And, for some reason, the particular sad sound of Farrar's voice pierces my heart more. https://t.co/JAw2pBfxVT
@RPBrat Totally asked about Rolling Stone thing. The end of the interview is him talking about his wife's reaction.
Would kavenagh have to recuse himself if the case did go to Supreme Court? He's been relentlessly and beautifully parodied on SNL.
To repeat: this statement by our sitting president is a DIRECT ATTACK ON FREE SPEECH. And is a clear bellwether of the way he wants his next two years to go. He wants to take the reins that control the press. He wants to rule without criticism. This is still an emergency. https://t.co/i2yWMlnstj
@bmtuck14 Merry New Year is what is said in that scene.
That Trump tweet about SNL violating the law by criticizing him should have us marching in the streets. There is something called a chilling effect on free speech. That is what he's doing. And that has to stop. Tolerating this is the road to fascism. It really is.

@BlackManUSA Yes. If Trump would be done. And that entire group out? Sure. It would be overwhelming and I'd be massively under qualified. But I would read like a motherfucker. And get tutored. And study. And hire geniuses. And Trumo would be gone.
@americanhodl have done both.
I'll answer more of these tomorrow when I take a writing break. Now, to Matt on the telly.
@NicZachary I do check out the Billions reddit a couple times a year. But I don't want to obsess over it. Which I would if I engaged more, I think. That said, I would do an AMA if the group wanted it.

I don't understand the first part. But yes, feel free to stray from three act structure, if that's the way you want or need to tell your story. Solitary Man, which I wrote and David and I directed, and which might be our best movie, has more of a two act structure, really. https://t.co/h8Egv8NNvb

Wait tho, the actual answer to @rachsyme's question about a favorite real New York movie that no one talks about as a New York movie, is Margin Call. I have watched it at least once a year since it came out. Gets right to the heart of a certain moment and attitude in this city.
No exaggeration, I have watched Trading Places 25 times. And I know it's a Philly movie. But the end, man, the end.

@Aworkman70212 Concord grape jelly! Made in house. And it will make you forget all about needing chocolate.
@EROHealthComms I wish I loved Carvel cakes as much as many of my favorite people do. But this: this is peanut butter ice cream, praline, picoso peanuts, peanut butter icing, and fresh made Concord grape jelly. It's absurdly delicious.
@DonZollo I recommend it all the time, Don. Pressfield is terrific. I've had a few meals with him. Smart, smart guy about this stuff.

@TheChuckHansen @ThisIsSethsBlog The Dip.
@dnvrsangel It's always hard. Breathe. Go back to the basics. Remember that you are in your position because you have proved you are capable.
The thing of it is: when I was a young person, I would let these doubts win. I would quit. I would tell myself I wasn't ever gonna be a real writer. I would then hate myself. Once I really decided to write every day, to endure those feelings but press on, everything changed.
To clarify. I'm good. I'm  letting you in on my own fears in order to show that you're not alone. As I said, I've trained myself to proceed. But it often seems to those on the outside that professionals can just smooth it out there without pain or doubt. I want to show the truth.
@hels Nah. Because once we are rewriting, we can use other tricks to move forward and finish.
5 then 1 then 6. Zoe, then Tim, then Chelcie and Saul. https://t.co/XUFr8GGbOL
If you're on the precipice of doing something that forces you to dig deep, and you feel afraid of it, want to run, quit, abando it, know that professionals feel that way too. All the time. We have just found a way to tolerate the doubt for a few hours at a time. You can too.
I have a hard writing thing to do today. I feel time pressure. I feel unsure I'm up to the task. I feel the weight of expectations. Of past successes and failures. I want to run from it. 	But I have trained myself, instead, to remember this: no one will see it until I'm done.

@Swag_Catholic Biggest advantage--having a really smart, caring, focused sounding board, advisor, counselor at the beginning of my professional life. But I don't read Douthat as being about any of that. I freely own how advantaged I was. Many don't own the structural advantages of class/race.
@Swag_Catholic He was. In the music business. (he's still alive and in good shape, thankfully). I'll tell you this: having a successful father was a huge leg up for me. Getting out of college without debt as a result, giant advantage. Learning how to talk to powerful people--giant advantage.
@NicZachary hahahahaha. I'm not Axe tho, so don't worry.

@DavidPoland Oh, yes. To me, the only leverage a writer has is NOT selling an undeniable piece.  So Stallone held out. Matt and Ben has it in the deal that they starred. Each took less money to take risk on themselves. Writing on spec is still the most powerful move a writer can make.

Someone challenged me: how many Stallone/Damon/Afflecks are there who delude themselves, get run over by the business, lose? The only answer I have is: right up until they succeeded, that's who Stallone and Ben/Matt where. Unrealistic dreamers. Who DID THE WORK DESPITE THE ODDS.
@JamieReidy I'm a writer, you know, my brother? So I think about the words. I wrote "see" first. Then "encounter." Then "apprehend." Because I wanted to get it right and clear. Good eye on your part, noticing.
Sometimes when I apprehend a truly great work--movie, painting, a perfect album, it seems it arrived fully formed from the artist's vision. But here's the truth: that artist had days it felt impossible to match the feeling in their head to work on the page. They just kept going.

@mrbeaks @Michael_Calia @tftalbott I'm quite familiar with rugelach. 	Meaning: I saw Krokus and bought their albums long before they were at all famous in the US. They were fun. Long Stick is hilarious. 	But they are the 100th best metal act of the era.
@mrbeaks @Michael_Calia @tftalbott yeah. well, I love Graham Bonnet Rainbow, too. JLT just happened to sing a couple of great tunes with them. 	But the Dio/Richie albums really live now. They are still worth listening to without the nostalgic attachment. (Krokus cannot be merely a / away from Maiden and Priest btw
@mrbeaks @Michael_Calia @tftalbott yes. but Dio Rainbow is, on balance, the best Rainbow.
@mrbeaks @tftalbott Yes. Yes you should.

I had this idea, growing up, that certain people were anointed as artists. Recognized for natural talent, how they looked, how they talked. And only they were allowed to try to do that kind of work. For years, it stopped me from even trying. Don't let it stop you. Do the work.
@emilylhauser And I totally respect the choice to not do it. I am really speaking to the fear of failure that stops people from even trying, or from getting back up.
@emilylhauser I understand this. And I'm not saying people should quit their jobs. In fact, I didn't quit when we wrote Rounders. I just woke up earlier and worked for a couple hours a day before my job. But I was lucky in a million ways. Had child care. Had some money. I know that.

To an artist, rejection, at first, feels like death. That‚Äôs how personal the work is. And that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre afraid to do the work. Because then we have to show it. And then they might reject it. But rejection is only a death if you let it stop you from doing the work the next day.

If you want to do work that makes you feel alive, but you‚Äôre not, it might be because you think the odds of success are stacked against you. You‚Äôre right. They are. But when you do the work anyway, something inside you changes, grows. And your definition of success does, too.

This week, I put up a repeat of a podcast episode I did w my wife @AmyLKoppelman. It‚Äôs perfect for this time of year because it‚Äôs about finding hope when hope seems to be hiding from you. Amy is a brilliant writer. Even more brilliant at this life thing. But it hasn‚Äôt come easy.
Happy Thanksgiving. I‚Äôm grateful every day for my family, friends, the work I get to do, the people I do it with, all of it. Take care of yourself emotionally these next few days. Reach out to someone if you need to talk. Thank you for engaging w me here. https://t.co/fWUOLL4YqD

Here‚Äôs one to remember: when you see writers, artists, anyone who has professional success, you are seeing the results of their work. So it seems easy for them. Like they were born to it. In truth: they had days, weeks, years where they wondered if the work would ever pay off.
I‚Äôll admit: I love the idea of me, writing while wearing a sport coat, Oxford shirt,  some grey wool slacks, standing at a desk and writing longhand, ripping pages and dropping em in a box to be typed up later. 	The reality is more like an Oscar Madison football Sunday. https://t.co/Elzi1HwjeO

@mrjeremydylan @ChrisHewitt Jeremy. I‚Äôm still reeling from that tweet @SammyKoppelman showed me. Reeling. It‚Äôs just so wrong. In so many ways. As Lennon himself would‚Äôve told you.
Also,@MikeLupica and Bill Goldman were friends, best friends, for 40 years. Mike loved Bill like a son loves his father. And took care of him the same way. All I want to hear is Mike talk about him. As he often did when Bill was alive.
There are many screenwriters like Tony Gilroy, Scott Frank, David Koepp, Richard LaGravenese who were family to Bill Goldman, and who were there with him, talking to him, this last year. I'm just someone who knew him a bit and was grateful for the time I did get to spend w him.
What an honor to talk about one of the greatest screenwriters who ever lived. And a truly great man who was so, so good to generations of screenwriters who followed him. I am so lucky to have known him a bit. And to have learned from him. https://t.co/EN9mAPpNNi
