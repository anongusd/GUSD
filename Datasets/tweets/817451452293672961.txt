@PattyMurray @SenateDems How do you suggest they investigate 30+ year old accusations where there is no credible forensic facts available.  If not, the accused has the presumption of innocence.  That‚Äôs basic in OUR country‚Äôs laws.
@RonWyden Easy.  They believe Judge Kavanaugh.  You might be surprised how many millions of people do.
@SenBlumenthal @SenateDems Are you voting for Kavanaugh?
@SenKamalaHarris So you‚Äôre saying that anyone can make an unsubstantiated allegation and you can not question them on it. What country do you live in?  It‚Äôs not America. No one has the right to ruin someone‚Äôs life and reputation without being asked for asked for proof.
@RealSaavedra @realDailyWire Then Schumer doesn‚Äôt belong in the Senate or deserve the title of Senator. When you take an oath to uphold the Constitution and then disregard it, you should resign.

@SenatorCantwell And how is it going to be credibly investigated?
@SenJeffMerkley Will Judge Kavanaugh receive the same dignity and respect?  In this country the accused has the presumption of innocence. There must be proof beyond a reasonable doubt. If the allegations can‚Äôt be proven, then he is innocent. How do you suggest she proves them.
@TaritaC @seungminkim @ChuckGrassley Sorry. Spell check. It allegation. And there still has been no charge yet by her under oath.
@TaritaC @seungminkim @ChuckGrassley First of all there has never been an allocation of rape. Second, she has not said anything under oath. In this country it‚Äôs innocent until PROVEN guilty.
@BFriedmanDC 2000 years ago there were facts.
@nytopinion And if it doesn‚Äôt support a criminal conviction or civil liability it isn‚Äôt credible. Then he is innocent.

I wish there was somewhere we could get the news, straight, after people have investigated and discovered all the facts. We don‚Äôt need stories to be interpreted, we just need to know what happened.  Remember the old who, what, when, where.  Then we can determine the why.
@grantstern @MarcACaputo And how many other companies in the world use it?
