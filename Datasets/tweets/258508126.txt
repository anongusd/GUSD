https://t.co/PamoxZVfCc		The CEO and a former board member at Alamerica Bank testified today. Here's a summary of their testimonies.
After Daryl's death, Clarissa signed an agreement that gave Donald Watkins Sr. control over her family's share of Masada.
Majority of company, therefore, owned by Johnson and Harms estates.
Watkins in his deposition claims that in 1998 he had a small piece of Masada -- "Pencor's piece of Masada which was 25% of a project in New York and 10% Class A of the other markets specified in the offering memorandum."
Harms says that when her husband died, his ownership was passed on into trust he established for his family. Harms says she cannot pinpoint the exact value of the company, but she remembers her late husband saying 40 million.
Article by CNN Money in 2003 profiling Daryl Harms: https://t.co/J0ftiJNuir
New witness: Clarissa Harms. Her husband was Daryl Harms who passed away in 2005. Daryl founded Masada with Terry Johnson.
Weaver says he is unaware of any Reg-O violations committed by Watkins Jr.
https://t.co/PamoxZVfCc		Two current and former top executives with Alamerica Bank have testified so far today.
We are back. Weaver says that Watkins Sr. never tried to suppress or conceal any information in regards to Arrington's loans.
We are adjourning for lunch.
Weaver says that Watkins was asked to leave the Alamerica Board of Directors for this reason.
Looking at the Audit Report Plan of Action: "Regulation O violations seem to have occurred related to Donald Watkins Sr's 100,000 line of credit that has been fully drawn most of the time since origination in 2000."
"It was deemed the be a Reg-O violation and once that happens there is no recourse except to follow the regulation procedures." That included an internal audit which Weaver says costed them about $35,000.
"We wouldn't have done it," says Weaver. Weaver explains that taking out this loan and passing the money to someone else would have "set off regulations."
Weaver says if he had known that the loan would ultimately be going to Donald Watkins Sr, it would have changed his decision making process.
Weaver says they were not aware that on the exact same day Arrington took out a loan for $101,000, Arrington wrote a check to Watkins Sr. for $100,000. "90-day loan" is written on the check.
Looking at the official commercial loan application for Arrington's first loan for $100,000.
Weaver served as a board member of Alamerica Bank.
Weaver was the insurance commissioner for the State of Alabama for 5 years.
New Witness: Mike Weaver
Watkins Jr's cross-examination questions establish that he was doing work as an insurance agent with State Farm at the time.
Right now we're looking at a letter addressed to Matt Rockett from Kimberly Perkins which talks about Nabirm and Charles Barkley's investments in the company. Perkins says Watkins wrote the letter and she merely signed it.
We're talking about how the Watkins Pencor offices are set up. Perkins says her, Watkins Sr, Watkins Jr and Arrington were all in the same suite.
Perkins started working for Donald Watkins Sr. as a receptionist in 2003.
Perkins says that she is an attorney
We just came out of a break. Government is calling Kimberly Perkins to the stand.
2/2 Prosecutor asks Tate if Watkins Sr. and Jr. ever gave the board an opportunity to turn them down by allegedly using Arrington as a straw man. Tate says they did not give him an opportunity.
1/2 "All loans to an executive officer must be promptly reported to the institution's board of directors. That means it must be reported at the next board meeting after the loan was made."
2/2 When Tate responded 7 days, Watkins replied, "7 days will not work. It has to be completed today. This is critical."
1/2 Texts submitted into evidence show Watkins Sr. texting Tate asking for Arrington Jr's loan to be processed more quickly. "Can you get Matt [Rockett] to finish Arrington‚Äôs transactions today? He has some thinks to take care of."
Watkins Jr. will now cross-examine Tate
Watkins: "Did you ever have an occasions where I asked you to fudge the riles?" Tate: "No."
Watkins: "Did Matt Rockett partake in any type of analysis to determine if I was an exception to the tangible benefits rule?" Tate says he does not know.
Tate agrees with Watkins' cross-examination question and says there is an exception: "when the proceeds are used to purchase goods or services from an insider of the institution in the normal course of commerce. "
We're talking about transfer regulations now: "If the institution make a loan and the proceeds of the loan are transferred to an insider or an insider receives tangible economic benefit from the loan then the loan is treats as if it were made directly to the insider."
Watkins Sr. is alleged of using Arrington to get loans from the bank in his place. Tate said had their board known the money was going to Watkins Sr, they would not have approved the loans for Arrington.
ICYMI: Here's my write-up on former Birmingham Mayor Richard Arrington Jr's testimony from yesterday. https://t.co/lCxHeiNtgo
Alamerica Bank CEO Larry Tate has taken the stand
Back inside the courtroom for day 6 of the Watkins fraud trial
Prosecution now re-directing.
Arrington Jr. Agrees that Watkins Jr. Has always been loyal, honest and trustworthy.
Donald Watkins Jr. is now cross-examining Arrington Jr.
Watkins Sr. has brought up the night his father died. He asked Arrington Jr. "And after that, you became a father figure to me, right?" Arrington agreed.
Arrington Jr. acknowledges that he has taken loans from Watkins Jr. in the past. When Watkins Sr. asked if the money exchange has been a two-way street, Arrington Jr. said "yes."
Arrington Jr. says that Watkins Jr. never asked him to falsify or conceal any information in his testimony.
bank*
Watkins Sr. will now cross-examine Arrington Jr.
Arrington Jr. says he got a promissory note saying Donald Watkins Sr would pay $415,000 (higher number due to interest) at an annual rate of 4.5%. Due date was September 5, 2014. Arrington Jr. says that this is the first promissory agreement made between the two parties.
On March 4, 2014, the back sent Arrington Jr. another letter saying that Arrington Jr. now owed $364k which included attorney fees and such.
Arrington Jr. received a letter on February 20, 2014 from Alamerica bank saying that the over 300k in outstanding loans was 71 days past due. Arrington Jr. went back to Donald Watkins Sr. who said he did not have the money to pay him back.
We're looking at a balance of one of Watkins Sr's accounts. Arrington Jr's $150,000 loan was deposited on November 20, 2012. On November 21, $53,000 in American Express payments were made.
2/2 "I knew Donald Watkins Sr. was not capable of acquiring those funds in the time frame that we needed them, and that he needed them, that I needed them, and so my next option on the list was Dr. Arrington."
1/2 Watkins Jr. Deposition: "[We] had some items that needed to be paid, and I believe we were looking for a short term solution to take care of those items. "
Arrington Jr. says he did not know that Watkins Sr. and Jr. intended to use his loans to pay off American Express obligations.
Document says the purpose of the loan is "equity injection to purchase additional ownership unit in a equity acquisition and provide working capital for Jennro, LLC"
A promissory note is being shown that says another loan was taken out November 20,2012 for $151,759.
JennRo wrote a 128k check to pay off Richard Arrington Jr's first two loans. With the check for 600k being used to pay off debt, Arrington Jr. now has just 150k outstanding.
On Oct 19, 2012, Richard Arrington Jr. wrote a check for $600,000 to Alamerica bank.
A check is being shown in court, written on Oct 10, 2012 that cleared Oct 18, 2012, to Richard Arrington Jr. for $600,000.
Now we're looking at bank statements that show an incoming wire to one of Watkins' account on Oct 15, 2012 for $750,000 from Charles Barkley.
We're taking a lunch recess and will be back at 1:30.
Also from Watkins Jr's deposition, he claims to have not given Arrington wiring instruction as he does not "know them by heart." Says that the "transaction was handled directly by JennRo, and directly by Dr. Arrington." Arrington says this is not true.
Deposition of Donald Watkins Jr: "I did not arrange for nay wires to be sent."
Arrington says that Donald Watkins Jr. handled the wire transfers, gave him instructions, told him what to sign etc.
2/2 The exact same day, $5,000 was paid out to Grant Aviation, $12,883 to Bank of Ozarks, $21,832 to Bloom Law Firm, and $488,408 to Varnum. By the end of the month, just about the entire $750,000 was transferred out.
1/2 Now we're looking at account balances. On September 21, 2012 Arrington's 750k was transferred to the account of Watkins Sr.
Arrington was throwing up about 260k in personal assets for the loan that was supposed to ultimately be repaid by Charles Barkley's investment, he says.
That letter to Rockett was dated September 18, 2012.
Arrington says he was put in touch with Matt Rockett, a loan officer at Alamerica Bank. Arrington wrote a letter to Rockett saying he would put up his personal assets for the loan.
Arrington received another request from Watkins for another loan, but this request was far larger than the previous: $750,000. Arrington said he didn't have the assets to make a loan of that size. Watkins Sr. suggested he use his life insurance policy.
To recap: Arrington already loaned out $126,000 to Watkins Sr. which had not been paid off. Watkins Sr. came back and asked for the added $750,000. Arrington claims that Watkins Sr. said he expected to receive a loan from Charles Barkley, and then would repay Arrington.
Email from Glenn Guthrie has been posted again. Emails show agreement struck between Charles Barkley's camp and Watkins in September of 2012.
Arrington says the loan was collateralized with his life insurance policies. Reads that should Arrington die, collectors are asked to go to Watkins Sr. for payment to avoid tapping the life insurance.
Arrington's affidavit from May 15, 2012 has been submitted as evidence. Arrington says he got an affidavit detailing his loans to Donald Watkins Sr. because he was growing more and more concerned that the loans would not be repaid.
Richard Arrington Jr. says he eventually became "concerned" that he might not get his money back from these loans.
Looking at a check now from Richard Arrington Jr. from 5/6/2011 for $20,000. This is another check labeled as a "loan" to Donald Watkins Sr.
Second loan Arrington took out was for $25,000
Watkins Sr. approached Arrington Jr. for a second loan in May of 2011.
Richard Arrington Jr. says he does not recall telling anyone that the loan he took out from Alamerica Bank would be going to Donald Watkins Sr.
The date for that 90 day loan is July 16th, 2010.
Richard Arrington Jr says he paid that 100k to Donald Watkins PC as a 90 day loan.
Richard Arrington Jr. says he took a loan of $100,000 from Alamerica Bank for Watkins Pencor.
Arrington Jr. says that the only compensation he has received is from some loan payments.
Arrington Jr. said that he played a very small role in the growth the company's interests across the country.
According to court documents, Watkins Sr. and Arrington Jr. signed an agreement in 2001 that conditionally granted him 10% of proceeds from Watkins Pencor.
Arrington Jr. says his office is just a couple doors down from Donald Watkins Sr's
Remember: Richard Arrington Jr. has been given immunity in this case to testify.
Arrington Jr. says he has known Donald Watkins Sr. for about two decades.
BREAKING: Former Birmingham Mayor Richard Arrington Jr. has taken the stand.
We are in recess until 11
Watkins Sr: "After you made your purchase, would you still deem that 'your money?'"
Taylor-Stoudamire says she only went to Donald Watkins Sr's data room only one time in 12 years. She says the one time she came in, she was "shuffled through real fast." "Why do I have to go through every piece of paper work if I trust you?"
Donald Watkins Sr. is back up for re-direct. Says that Taylor-Stoudamire had 3-4 weeks to read the purchase agreement and the agreement is only 2 pages long.
Judge Bowdre is telling Donald Watkins Jr. that his questions are too long and not tailored enough. Remember, both Donald Watkins Sr. and Jr are representing themselves and handling their own cross-examination.
Taylor-Stoudamire agrees that the majority of information she received came from Donald Watkins Sr. before signing. After signing the agreement, she can't remember which emails came from who because "both of your names were on everything."
@WarOnDumb Yeah it was all pointing back to the Eric Marcus testimony.
Donald Watkins Jr. continuing with his previously used strategy of distancing himself -- asking Taylor-Stoudamire if they ever discussed the investments together. Jr. says he wouldn't have been sending her emails if she had not already made agreements with Donald Watkins Sr.
Donald Watkins Sr. concludes cross-examination. Now Donald Watkins Jr. is up.
Taylor-Stoudamire: "With this investigation going on I just haven't talked to you because I just hope that this is a nightmare."
Taylor-Stoudamire: "I hope all of this goes away and it‚Äôs a nightmare I am not living. I trusted you as a friend of the family."
Taylor Stoudamire: "I trusted you and invested with you to invest in Masada, not to invest in Donald [Watkins Sr.]."
Taylor-Stoudamire admits there there is always a degree of risk when making investments.
Watkins Sr. "Did you request any changes in the language of the purchase agreement before or after you signed it?" Taylor-Stoudamire: "I didn't request any changes because I trusted you."
Taylor-Stoudamire says she went against the advice of her financial advisers and said "I thought you were a person of integrity."
2/2 ‚ÄúWhile the overwhelming majority of the sales proceeds have been used directly or indirectly to fund Masada's growth and expansion, there was no provision in the Watkins Pencor/Masada operating agreements that required the proceeds of the sale to be invested in Masada.‚Äù
1/2 Now we're looking at the purchasing agreement. Donald Watkins Sr. read the below portion:
Donald Watkins Sr. showing document that says "The Watkins Pencor economic participation agreements are irrevocable."
No further questions from prosecutor. Now Donald Watkins Sr. will cross-examine the witness.
"I believed that I was investing in a company," says Taylor-Stoudamire. She says that comes from what Donald Watkins Sr. and Jr. told her and emailed her.
Donald Watkins Sr. re-affirms in that video statement that investors were not investing in Masada, they were investing in Donald Watkins Sr. Taylor' Stoudamire shakes her head and says she was always under the impression she was investing in the company, Masada.
Deposition tape of Donald Watkins Sr. says that investors never asked where the money was going. Taylor-Stoudamire says "that is absolutely not true," and she asked several times where her money was going.
2/2 ....the only way that emails could not have crossed state lines is if all senders/recipients were in NJ at the exact same time. This is part of the prosecution's case to prove wire fraud.
1/2 Taylor-Stoudamire says she has never lived in New Jersey and never opened and of these emails in New Jersey. Eric Marcus' testimony last week said that since their east coast email server is in New Jersey...
Courtroom is being shown an email from Donald Watkins Sr. to Jr with an attached Masada Stakeholder Report. Taylor-Stoudamire says she and other investors were sent a couple of these and they made her feel secure with her investment.
Now we're looking at emails from Donald Watkins Jr. to Taylor-Stoudamire thanking her for investing and visiting Birmingham, and telling her there will be investor meetings in the coming future. Taylor-Stoudamire says no such investment meetings ever took place.
Prosecution claims that Taylor-Stoudamire's money went towards paying for Watkins Sr's girlfriends expenses which include Neiman Marcus charges and a hotel room at the NYC Palace Hotel.
Prosecutor: "Did you know that your money was going to be used to pay all the loans of the defendant and a credit card in the name of Marion Snell?" Taylor-Stoudamire: "Absolutely not." She adds she would have never invested if she knew this info.
Bank statement from June 30, 2007 shows a 100k payment to a Marion Snell, Donald Watkins Sr.'s girlfriend. The statement shows that the 100k was paid after Taylor-Stoudamire's $1 million wire transfer came in. Before the wire transfer, there were insufficient funds.
Taylor-Stoudamire says that Watkins Sr. never told her that her investment would be used to pay off personal debts.
The $1 million wire transfer from the Stoudamires to Watkins Pencor was received in June of 2007.
Donald Watkins Jr. sent a follow-up email saying they had not received the million dollar wire transfer about a week later.
An email displayed in court shows that Donald Watkins Jr. emailed Taylor-Stoudamire the purchasing agreement and wire transfer instructions after she and her husband invested in Masada.
Taylor-Stoudamire says Donald Watkins Sr. was well known in the community and was in pursuit of purchasing sports teams such as the Rams which is why she was interested in arresting.
Natasha Taylor-Stoudamire has taken the witness stand. Her husband is Damon Stoudamire, retired NBA player and current head coach at the University of Pacific.

Trial is in recess and is expected to resume Monday morning. I'll have a full recap of today on the @CBS_42 website this evening.
Daniel Meachum has been called to testify.
Watkins Jr's cross-examination has concluded. Re-direct from prosecution.
Judge Bowdre has been taking exception with some of Watkins Jr's questions, saying at one point he has moved far away from the "traditional question and answer format" and "you cannot testify yourself" during cross-examination.
Guthrie says that Barkley was his boss. If Barkley said to do something, he did it.
As a complete aside to the trial, attendance in this courtroom has grown. I'm counting 32 spectators here today. Yesterday there were no more than 15 (also by my count).
Watkins Sr. concludes cross-examinations. Watkins Jr. will now cross-examine Guthrie.
Watkins Sr. and Guthrie have been going back and forth. Guthrie says that he's tired of going over the same things "over and over" again with Watkins Sr. Judge Bowdre has been trying to keep Watkins Sr. on track and keep his arguments within the scope of the legal arguments made.
Guthrie makes an outburst to the Judge saying Watkins Sr. is insulting his integrity and "insinuating that I haven't done my job."
Guthrie to Watkins Sr. "You had a great persona of being an NFL owner, and Charles believed it. I did too."
Watkins Sr. shows through court submitted evidence that he sold 5% of his interest in Nabirn Energy Services. Says Barkley still owns that asset today.
Guthrie: "Wherever you son (Donald Jr.) told me to send the money, I sent it."
Guthrie: "All I remember is sending you [Watkins Sr.] $6.15 million over 7 years that Charles [Barkley] never received any return on."
Guthrie says to Watkins Sr. "You went around me and didn't consult me when you when did business." Guthrie says that Barkley would just tell him to wire the money.
Guthrie says he retired as Barkley's adviser in 2015
Watkins Sr. will now cross-examine Guthrie.
3/3 Guthrie says that none of those expenses were listed in the email sent to Barkley asking for $150,000.
2/3 "Pay 2k more on my Visa and pay a one month 2500 retainer for Jessica so that she can pay her personal bills. Leave rest in my account for payroll."
(1/3) An email from Donald Watkins Sr. to Donald Watkins Jr. on the same day reads: "If Charles [Barkley] comes through, please pay your AmEx (79k), Jessica‚Äôs AmEx (40,750.23) and my AmEx (10k).
Email submitted as evidence from May 24, 2013 from Donald Watkins Sr. says he has been traveling overseas to look after investments but incurred more expenses that he thought. Asked Barkley for 150k to cover expenses through June 1, 2013.
Trial is back in session
Currently in recess for lunch and will be back at 12:45
(3/3) Guthrie says that if Barkley knew his money was being used to pay off Watkins Sr's debts, he believes Barkley would have never invested.
(2/3) Watkins Jr. includes a list of expenses that he labeled as a ‚Äúpriority‚Äù including 40k for 2009 Georgia income taxes and 90k for past due bills, loan payments and alimony.
(1/3) An email from Donald Watkins Jr. to Donald Watkins Sr. with the subject line ‚ÄúIdea for Money‚Äù says that ‚ÄúYou need to consider going back to Barkley for $1 million loan/investment. I hate to go there but I don‚Äôt think we have any more options.‚Äù
We're now talking about Watkins Sr's credit ratings and debts. Guthrie says that if he had known about them, he would have stepped in and tried to convince Barkley not to invest because of his fiduciary responsibility.
Email sent from Watkins Sr. to Barkley on May 13, 2011 asks for another $1 million loan that will be repaid "when the Waste Management deal closes." Included would be a "friendship kicker" of 100k.
Also on May 14th, a Balance of Donald Watkins Sr's account shows that Watkins' held a debit of $750,000.
A letter sent by Donald Watkins Sr. on May 8th, 2010 mentions a potential opportunity to partner with business leaders like Mexico's Carlos Slim. Email says that he needs $1 million by May 14th -- 6 days later. Documents show that Barkley sent the money on May 14th.
@MitchNark @sixers Yes we are
Last wire transfer Barkley made to Donald Watkins Sr was May 28th, 2013 in the amount of $150,000
Documents show that when Barkley transferred $1 million to Watkins Sr's account in April of 2012, Watkins Sr. had a balance -2,100 dollars
Maturity date listen in the promissory note says that the maturity date of the deal was May 14th, 2011. Guthrie says that's when the money was due to be paid to Barkley Enterprises. "No funds were received from Donald Watkins."
Guthrie says that Barkley wanted him to "butt out" of the investment and not dive into Watkins Sr.'s financial paperwork.
Guthrie states in his testimony that, after making 8 separate investments totaling $6.15 million on behalf of Barkley, no returns have been received on any of those investments.
Document submitted into evidence shows that $6.15 million was invested by Barkley into Masada from 2007-2013. Some investments are listed as "loans," some are listed as "Economic Interest." All eight investments are described as "Wire" transfers.
Guthrie says he has not spent much time in NJ. His offices have always been in Birmingham.
Guthrie explains Barkley wired the money because Watkins Sr. was a friend. It was something he wanted to do, no questions asked.
Guthrie: "Charles called one morning and said 'hey I need you to do something." He proceeded to tell me that he wanted me [Guthrie] to wire Donald Watkins $1 million." Guthrie says money was wired to Watkins Sr., Watkins Jr. gave him the wiring instructions.
Now we're talking about Barkley Enterprises. Guthrie says Barkley is sole owner, and investments that when in there came from his work with TV. Nothing from his NBA days.
Guthrie: "I bought some stocks and bonds for Barkley. And when Charles puts trust in you...he wanted you to do it all. He expected you to do it all."
Guthrie: "I was not just his financial adviser. I oversaw both his personal and financial affairs."
Guthrie worked at the firm Raymond James
Glenn Guthrie, who was Charles Barkley's financial adviser, has now taken the stand.
Recess now until 10:35
No cross-examination from Watkins Jr.
Marcus re-affirms that every sender and recipient MUST have been in New Jersey for the emails to not cross state lines. Marcus says he cannot determine with absolute certainty if the senders were all in NJ, but he acknowledges that it is statistically unlikely that all were there
Prosecutor Kyle Hankey back up for redirect and questioning Marcus.
Watkins Sr.: "Is it your testimony that you cannot say for fact that you cannot say for certain that these emails traveled across state lines." Marcus says he is not certain these emails traveled across state lines.
Watkins Sr. Cross-examining. He's asking Marcus if he could tell for sure where the sender was at the time each email submitted to evidence was sent. Marcus is answering "no" to each.
Marcus says that with the server based in New Jersey there's only one way emails could not cross state lines: If all recipients and senders are in NJ at the time the email was sent, received, and read.
Marcus: "Absolutely not" when asked if they have any hosting servers in Georgia or Alabama.
https://t.co/ANZUO2cAEF was also hosted in New Jersey, according to Marcus.
Marcus: "That account was absolutely hosted in New Jersey."
Marcus: "The domain of https://t.co/5C7DyukNfJ was pointed towards our west coast server which is a proxy. Once it was received there, it would then travel to New Jersey where the data center for this mailbox resided.‚Äù
No major development with this new witness. Right now we're just going over how a cloud service works. Marcus says that he can see what emails pass through their server: "How they traversed, where they came from, where they went."
New Witness: Eric Marcus, Production Systems administrator at Intermedia -- a cloud service. Marcus says he manages the "health" of the system.
I‚Äôm back here at the Hugo L. Black United States Courthouse for day four of the #WatkinsFraudTrial https://t.co/DKzgRIMHrV
Trial is in recess, expected to resume tomorrow
Rush: "We were not moving forward with the Masada opportunity."
Rush: "We didn't care about anything outside our traditional business."
Rush says that he helped evaluate smaller companies.
Rush served as the Senior Vice President of Organic Growth at Waste Management.
Carl Rush worked at Waste Management from 2001-2012.
Cross-examination of Barnes has concluded. Carl Rush is the latest witness to take the stand.
Email from Watkins: "We expect the total value of the WM deal to be in the range of $2-$5 billion." Barnes says no deal was coming together to his knowledge, let alone one of this size.
Email sent by Watkins claims that the Waste Management deal would be proceeding forward on "three fronts." Barnes says that if a deal was proceeding forward, he would know about it, but he says this deal was not progressing to his knowledge.
Another email from Watkins Sr. says that "business alliance talks with Waste Management have begun in earnest." Barnes says that no such talks were under way.
Watkins sent an email stating that acquaintances working on behalf of Masada were in direct talks with the CEO and CFO of Waste Management. Barnes says he has no knowledge of this.
Barnes says there was a "hope" they could meet with Waste Management and other companies, but no deal was set in stone.
Watkins Sr. sent an email saying that Waste Management would try to acquire all of Masada's assets.
Charles Barkley has been mentioned in an email sent by Watkins Sr. Mentions Barkley Enterprises and Ben Barnes Group engaging in a joint venture. Barnes says he never entered into an agreement like this.
Barnes says that discussions with WM had not begun, they were not with the highest levels of the corporations, and there was no interest in buying IP rights. At that time in 2011, Barnes says he did not have a joint venture with Masada.
An email from April of 2011 sent from Watkins Sr. claims that Barnes has "already begun" his discussions with Waste Management at the highest levels, and believes that Waste Management will attempt to acquire Masada's IP rights.
Barnes says that in one of his early discussions with Watkins Sr, he thought that Waste Management could be a potential prospects in terms of companies to work with.
Barnes describes Tom Fatjo, with Waste Corporation of America, was brought into talk but was candid that he did not think his company was big enough to meet the demands of Masada.
Barnes is discussing Waste Corporation of America, a garbage company. He says it's similar to Waste Management in its purposes, but he estimates Waste Management is "significantly larger." Estimates 10 times larger that Waste Corporation of America.
Barnes testified that the purpose of his efforts were to connect Mr. Watkins to potential investors.
Barnes said he too went into talks with Masada about a partnership in some capacity.
New witness called by prosecution is Ben Barnes with Ben Barnes Group.
Early lunch recess at the Watkins trial today. Will be back at 12:40
Rodriguez says he has "never met, seen, or talked with Donald Watkins Jr."
Rodriguez says that "If you (Watkins) were for real, and your company were for real," he would have accepted a finder's fee or brokerage arrangement for helping set Masada up with foreign contacts.
Watkins asks Rodriguez if his company is in business still which he said no. Watkins then asked, "Do you know if Masada is still in business," to which Rodriguez quipped, "I don't know and I don't care."
"Do you consider a brokered arrangement a partnership?" asks Watkins. Rodriguez says no. Rodriguez adds that he never contacted his contacts overseas.
Rodriguez says that he and Rosenbloom stepped away from investing in Masada. "Once that obstacle was removed, you were interested in helping Masada?" asked Watkins Sr during cross-examination.
Rodriguez sent Watkins Sr. an email sharing "good news" with Watkins Sr. about waste management projects in Morocco.
Rodriguez in an email said to Watkins Sr: "Thank you for the opportunity of the lifetime." Rodriguez explains that he had never gotten into this industry before and wanted to feel out and see who Watkins was as a person.
Donald Watkins Sr. will now cross-examine Rodriguez.
Rodriguez says "He is trying to drop every name to get investors to invest." and "We made it very clear we were not interested in investing."
Email from Watkins, asking rhetorically: "Why is Chip Rosenbloom, after consulting with JP Morgan, trying to aggressively partner with Masada." Rodriguez calls these "lies" and says there is no basis to say Rosenbloom is trying to partner with Masada.
Rodriguez: "After all of this stuff, it seemed like it was all smoke and mirrors." That's why Rodriguez says he did not want to be involved.
Email from Rosenbloom to Watkins Sr. recommends a finders fee for Lupe -- introducing foreign contacts to Masada. Email also says that Lupe "has concerns about being a part of this joint venture."
In response to last last email, Rodriguez said in his testimony: "I don't know how he got this mixed up. When we said no, we meant no. Not close."
Email sent to investors by Donald Watkins Sr says "we should have Rodriguez/Rosenbloom agreement finalized soon." Email requests about $5 million extra to expand investments into other countries.
Email from Chip Rosenbloom says that he was so tied up with the Rams that he would be unable "to take on new projects with Masada," and suggested maybe Rodriguez could help introduce Watkins to some contacts in Mexico and Morocco. Rodriguez: "this was a long shot"
Rodriguez says there was no pressing need to fund anything. Email from Watkins asks for $1 million. Rodriguez says there was no urgent need for that email to be sent to investors.
Another email sent by Watkins says that Masada hoped to expand operations to a basket of different countries. Watkins Sr. sent an email to investors asking whether or not to commit funds in order to make this leap.
Prosecutor: "Did you ever tell Mr. Watkins that you could secure a partnership with Carlos Slim?"		Rodriguez: "I would never do that because I don't know the man. I have never met the man personally. Why would I put myself in a position to lie?"
Same email mentions Carlos Slim as someone they could potentially partner with. Rodriguez said he had a mutual friend of Slim, but never said anything about securing a partnership.
"He is using our family name and this is bogus," says Rodriguez.
Email from Donald Watkins Sr: "We have an immediate opportunity to partner with Chip Rosenbloom and his family (owners of the St. Louis Rams) who can secure long-term waste management contracts for Masada in Morocco." 		Rodriguez: "That is not a true statement."
Lupe Rodriguez says that he has never met Donald Watkins Jr.
Clarification: Rodriguez is the ex-brother in law of Chip Rosenbloom.
Rodriguez says that Watkins Sr. asked him to invest in and become a part of Masada. 2010 email submitted to the court as evidence shows he declined.
Lupe Rodriguez, whose brother-in-law is Chip Rosenbloom, has taken the stand now. He is discussing Watkins Sr's effort to pursue purchasing the then St. Louis Rams.

Watkins trial will resume tomorrow morning.
https://t.co/xrGo4LiikL		Three household names took the stand Wednesday to testify in the fraud trial of Donald Watkins Sr. and Donald Watkins Jr: former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former NFL linebacker and Auburn alum Takeo Spikes, and Martin Luther King III.
Email from Watkins says he needed MLK III to meet with President Obama on behalf of Masada at Camp David. MLK III never said he was against doing this, but he wanted more information.
King says that he does not recall ever agreeing to join Watkins' team or call President Obama directly (Who King is a friend/close acquaintance of) to convince the then President of the United States to work with Masada.
Judge Bowdre says to disregard this statement^
Martin Luther King III is the latest witness called to the stand.
Spikes slams Watkins: ‚ÄúDonald Watkins you are an embarrassment to your colleagues and your benefits. I think you are a menace to society. You are a detriment to your family. Not only are you a disgrace to America but you are a disgrace to Black America.‚Äù
Spikes asks to make a statement. Watkins objects. Prosecutor steps in and says ‚ÄúI have another question! Mr. Spikes, is there a question you wish I had asked?‚Äù Spikes responds ‚Äúwhat do I think of Mr. Watkins?‚Äù
Spikes says he was interested in Masada and growing the company, not paying over $200k in back taxes for Watkins.
Spikes says he's invested $1 million and received "nothing" in return.
Prosecutor: "Did your financial adviser tell you that Donald Watkins Sr. told him that he could spend the money on whatever he wanted?" Spikes: "No"
Spikes: "I invested because of what Donald Watkins St. told me."
Re-direct from prosecutors
Watkins concludes cross-examination. Watkins Jr. will now cross-examine Spikes.
Spikes: "I don't recall receiving anything from you that says I am a shareholder."
We have resumed
Another quick recess. Back at 2:30
Spikes claims that Watkins "always made an excuse" when he tried to coordinate a time to review financial records.
Spikes with a soft-spoken outburst: "You're trying to act like you've been transparent but you haven't."
Watkins is asking Spikes if he wired money to Masada or Watkins.
Watkins has brought up the St. Louis Rams. Spikes says that Watkins' interest in pursuing the purchase of the team was not a "huge" factor in his decision to invest more monies.
Spikes admits he never had issues getting in touch with Watkins and that information was not ever "off-limits."

Watkins: "Has somebody told you that you do not own what you bought from me in January of 2007?" Spikes: "No." Watkins: "Has any financial adviser told you what you bought from me in 2007 is worthless?" Spikes: "No."

Currently in a recess. Resuming at 1:15
Watkins will now cross-examine Spikes.
Spikes: "I thought Donald Watkins was a friend."	Prosecutor: "Did you trust him?"	Spikes: "I trusted him enough to give him my money."		No further questions from prosecutors.
Audio recording of Watkins says he claimed Masada was worth "a couple billion dollars." Spikes says that Watkins had claimed this several times.
Recording of Watkins says Charles Barkley is one if his investors and friends.
Spikes says that he was told in 2013 that, after investing, he DID NOT have any stock in Watkins' company. Spikes claims this is not what he was told when he first invested.
Video of Watkins shows him claiming investors were investing in and "riding with" him. "They would get a piece of whatever I got."
Spikes, upon watching the video, is lost for words. This is the first time that he has seen this video of Watkins. "It shows that he's been lying...it's disturbing."
Video shows Watkins saying investors were investing in him as an individual, not the company.
Prosecutor just played a clip where Watkins says investors money WOULD NOT be used for Masada purposes. Spikes says that he WAS told his money would be used for Masada purposes.
Spikes says that Watkins claimed he and other investors would be able to purchase St. Louis Rams. If Watkins had told Spikes that he had issues paying off credit card debt, "I would have known he was lying," says Spikes. "You can't spend what you don't have."
Prosecutor: "When you invested with Mr. Watkins in 2009, did you have any idea he had issues with paying credit cards?" Spikes: "Not at all."
Spikes says that he invested a total of $1 million and Rice's potential involvement with Masada played a large role in that.
Spikes says that Watkins never admitted to having back taxes. Spikes says that he would have never invested if he had known that. "I'm not investing into your personal needs."
Rice has concluded her testimony. Now it's former Auburn Football player Takeo Spikes.
From previous testimony: "Has Condoleezza Rice ever been affiliated or associated with Masada?" Watkins testimony: "yes...she was interested." Later, Watkins' testimony reads: "She agreed to work with us as an adviser."
We are currently in recess...trial expected to resume soon
Rice says that nobody ever mention Watkins Jr's name to her at any point.
Donald Watkins Jr. will now be cross-examining Rice.
"The decision [to not partner] was based on other opportunities [Regents for example]." In terms of the Rams, Rice said that she felt she had to consult with legal advisers and financial advisers which she had not done so. That's why she decided to go in a different direction.
Rice says she did not question whether Watkins had any relationship with Martin Luther King III at the time of their talks.
Rice says the "last straw" that broke any hope of her partnership was the Rams agreement -- she said that "Masada was linked to the Rams in a way that made me feel uncomfortable."
Rice: "In most of my engagements, I'm not into having somebody supervise me. I haven't had a boss in some time." Rice in response to Watkins asking if she understood that he would be her direct supervisor.
Rice says that during the recruiting process, Watkins was not soliciting money from her.
Rice: "A number of opportunities came along and it was becoming more unlikely that Masada would be one of them but I kept it in the running." She elaborates that at that moment, she did not outright say she was no longer interested.
Rice testified that after leaving her role with the State Dept, Watkins tried to recruit her to his team. Rice says she never issued a press release saying she would join his team, and never consented to a press release being sent out.
Condoleezza Rice is testifying now in the Donald Watkins trial. With Watkins representing himself, he's cross-examining Rice personally.

Robinson's report date will be 8 weeks from today -- 2pm on November 27th.
Robinson must also pay special assessment fee of $700 -- $100 for each count
Court ordering Robinson to pay $169,151 in restitution.
BREAKING: Judge Abdul Kallon sentences former Alabama Rep. Oliver Robinson to 33 months in prison.
Judge Kallon: Unfortuantely for Mr. Robinson, this court must factor in the circumstances of the crimes
Prosecutor affirms that he believes a fair sentence is 33 months.
Prosecutor says he wants to send a message that cooperation will be rewarded.
Prosecutor: "It was his co-conspirators that led him down this path. As the court witnessed, Oliver Robinson testified truthfully at trial compared to at least one of his co-conspirators who did not.‚Äù
Prosecutor: ‚ÄúEvery prosecutorial instinct I had said that I should really sock it to him with making my recommendation. But he is the only elected official who has humbly and truthfully accepted responsibility for his crimes."
Prosecutor is now addressing the court.
Oliver Robinson has concluded his statement
Oliver Robinson: "I look forward to continuing the path towards redemption with every step I take for the rest of my life."
"[Since 2016] there has not been one day, not one, that has not been difficult for me to get out of bed in the morning. Not one day that it hasn‚Äôt been difficult for me to eat. Not one day that it hasn‚Äôt been difficult for me to look myself in the mirror.‚Äù
Robinson: "My life has been about helping everyone. But in this case, I have failed."
Oliver Robinson: "Let me begin by apologizing to the court and to the government for causing this hearing today. Let me also apologize to my family, friends, church members, UAB family...and more importantly, the residents of North Birmingham."
Jaffe has concluded his statements. Oliver Robinson will now address the courtroom.
Jaffe: "What more can a man suffer than knowing he has betrayed the ones that he loves."
Jaffe read a quote that said: "[Robinson] has shone a light onto a very dark corner of Alabama politics."
Jaffe: "There is all types of cooperation and all types of cooperators. But I'm not sure if I have ever seen the quality and extent of this type of cooperation along with the deep sense of remorse and repentance [that Robinson provided]."
Jaffe: "Oliver realizes that his inexcusable betrayal is something that he will live with for the rest of his life."
Jaffe: "Oliver Robinson's credible testimony was a major factor and force in the way this trial went and the government achieved [victory in the Gilbert/Roberson trials].
Jaffe: "He got a little full of himself which allowed him to take a left turn, when he should have been on a straight path."
Jaffe says that Robinson was a model citizen before "he took the wrong turn." Says Robinson is ashamed and has a difficult time facing the public, but he has wholeheartedly cooperated to this point.
Jaffe: "We are here to achieve a defense that is sufficient but not more than necessary."
Dr. Sutton: "It is my firm conviction, with all of my heart, does not just have worldly remorse that he has been caught. He is broken and contrite with a sincerity that I can clearly read."
Dr. Sutton also hosts a weekly bible study. After hearing of what "sins" Robinson had committed, Sutton invited Robinson.
Defense has now called Dr. Frank Sutton, the UAB Basketball team's physician when Robinson was on the team.
Braden: "I believe Oliver to be remorseful. I don't have a lot of facts about his case. I'm just here because I believe him."
Braden: "I watched Oliver grow up from a high school senior to a man."
Defense has called Daryl Braden of Memphis, TN to the stand.
Attorney says that restitution in this case is over $169,000. Attorney says Robinson has brought a check made out to the clerk of this denomination today.
"It would have been easier to run from the allegations...it takes a special person to own his misconduct."
Attorney says Robinson helped root out the corruption he was a part of.
"Oliver did not run from the allegations or bury himself from denial. No, Oliver began to cry and decided he would face these allegations head on. Fully accepting responsibility for his actions head on."
"It takes a special person to be in the position that Oliver Robinson is in." Says that it takes a lot for a former athlete, politician, and business man to admit to wrongdoing and face the truth like he is now.
"Oliver captured the hearts of people in the state of Alabama."
"Oliver came back to Birmingham and became a businessman." Mentioned how he gave back to the community by teaching individuals financial literacy.
One of Robinson's Attorneys: "We are here today because of Oliver Robinson. Oliver Robinson has been a beloved public figure for over 30 years. He was able to accomplish what most could only dream of doing with a basketball."
Video is highlights of Robinson playing basketball at UAB. "We had the stuff in Birmingham that could make championships," Robinson says in the video.
Richard Jaffe is representing Robinson today. Robinson's defense team is playing a 45 second video in an effort to urge the court towards leniency.
Judge Kallon: "The court will likely grant the motion"
Prosecution is seeking 33 to 41 months of prison time for Robinson
Judge Kallon now reminding Robinson that the plea deal/recommendations from the prosecutor are not binding.
Sentencing hearing is now under way

@Benny_thejets that Lucroy trade veto hurts the most
@Benny_thejets That being said, if you were to sell the farm, better to sell for Catcher I agree
@Benny_thejets Don't disagree with that either. But with pitchers going 6+ and w/ Allen + Miller it takes burden off young lineup
@Benny_thejets I don't agree with holding back in 2016 for the thinking the team will be even better in 2017. Too much can happen in 1 year.
@Benny_thejets I don't disagree but I'm saying when you have the best record in the AL right now you make the best move for today and 2016
@Benny_thejets yeah but that's centered around winning in 2018. If you're talking winning in 2016 he was way down the depth chart
Really? Really, Lucroy?
