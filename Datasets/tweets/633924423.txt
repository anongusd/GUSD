The internet community must work together to protect the free and open internet. IA supports all efforts — including comprehensive bipartisan legislation — to restore strong, enforceable #netneutrality protections. https://t.co/pKHn7j9NL3
This all seems pretty reasonable, right? That’s why the majority of Americans across the country support #netneutrality - via @Mozilla https://t.co/mrkScfVUc1 https://t.co/4OiPa2eupm
Why is this such a big problem? According to the FCC, half of all Americans and 87 percent of rural Americans have no choice for broadband access. That means that half of all Americans will just be stuck if their ISP starts throttling content. #netneutrality https://t.co/8vXuMJqffb
What’s paid prioritization? Paid prioritization allows ISPs to create internet fast lanes that would make their preferred content faster than the rest of the internet. #netneutrality https://t.co/CPGMpKDHNG
What’s throttling? ISPs can also throttle content – intentionally slowing down access to content or sites. #NetNeutrality https://t.co/QMSU8gEncw
What’s blocking? Repealing #netneutrality rules allows ISPs to block a person’s access to certain types of services - like video streaming - or even block access to specific sites altogether. https://t.co/NO50sJDEjf
The internet industry believes that a thriving internet ecosystem depends on strong, enforceable #netneutrality protections. That means no blocking, throttling, or paid prioritization. https://t.co/2dt8P5gpbJ

Internet companies support federal privacy legislation that provides people with meaningful control over how the data they provide to companies. That includes the ability to access, correct, delete, &amp; download. #60Minutes https://t.co/iOwFBhQeHu
Internet companies believe Americans should be able to understand how the information they share is collected, used, &amp; protected. People should have meaningful controls &amp; the ability to access, correct, delete, &amp; download the personal information they have provided to a company.
.@Motherboard: “Even when consumers are aware of both the existence of data brokers and the extent of data collected, it's difficult to determine which data they can control.” #60Minutes	https://t.co/ZkpGomqXM2
.@Motherboard recently wrote a story on data brokers, defining them as “entities that collect information about consumers, and then sell that data… to other data brokers, companies, and/or individuals.” #60Minutes	https://t.co/ZkpGomqXM2
Context means that people have varying expectations for the data they provide to companies based on their relationship with the company, the sensitivity of the data, the level of engagement a company has with the data, &amp; the size &amp; complexity of the company. #60Minutes
Companies should meet people’s expectations of how data is used or shared with a third-party. Any new privacy framework should consider the context in which individuals share information with companies. #60Minutes
Every company collects data: grocery stores, airlines, retailers etc. Any national privacy framework must provide the same protections for people’s data regardless of whether it was gathered online or offline, across every sector of the economy #60Minutes
Legally required T&amp;C agreements are long &amp; complicated. Online platforms are constantly creating new tools &amp; services to help people understand &amp; control their privacy anytime once they’re ON the platform. You don’t get that opportunity once you sign a mortgage, for example.
People should have full transparency &amp; control over how the data they share with companies is used, seen, &amp; shared. This includes being able to access, correct, delete, &amp; download data provided to all companies. https://t.co/iOwFBhQeHu #60Minutes
For example, @Eater reported restaurants are collecting data from their customers: “restaurants… are creating individual customer profiles tracking everything from Frappuccino flavor preferences to what time of day someone typically comes into a store" https://t.co/Z420MkyuGO
Every company collects data: grocery stores, airlines, retailers etc. Any national privacy framework must provide the same protections for people’s data regardless of whether it was gathered online or offline, across every sector of the economy #60Minutes
All companies - both online &amp; offline - use data for a variety of business models. Any comprehensive privacy framework should consider and allow for existing and future business models so we don’t stifle innovation. #60Minutes
FACT: 1,300+ American companies—including news sites—can’t comply with GDPR because the rules are too difficult. It’s one thing if someone in Brussels can’t access the LA Times, but it’s problematic if it’s unavailable to LA residents. Full list is here: https://t.co/8xQNjoAGsN
Kleiner Perkins found that seven of the top 10 internet companies in the world were founded here in the U.S. An American privacy framework should be a model for the world in doing both: protecting /empowering consumers and enabling innovation. #60Minutes https://t.co/chj0SaFDz2
Our members are committed to ensuring our products &amp; services comply with GDPR. We need an American approach to protecting people’s privacy based on U.S. sensibilities &amp; expectations that considers regulatory interoperability with rules like GDPR. #60Minutes

In short, the commercial cloud cuts down operational costs, provides scaling flexibility, offers more instant cybersecurity solutions, and makes information sharing easier overall.
In recent years, roughly 75% of the federal government’s $80 billion IT budget has been used to maintain legacy IT systems. The time is now for government agencies to modernize by adopting commercial cloud solutions. https://t.co/TSlXyyiBPT
Commercial clouds have been used in the private sector for years, and it’s time for government agencies to have access to the same level of innovation provided by the commercial cloud. #CloudComputing
The ease of scaling with the commercial cloud helps companies become more nimble and, ultimately, helps lower operational costs. https://t.co/7Z2NYIdHah
Commercial clouds offer the flexibility to adapt to each project and reallocate resources depending on the amount of computing power that is needed. https://t.co/RWD1BpuEpZ

Internet Association Hires Director Of Diversity And Inclusion Policy And Counsel https://t.co/g92DQTeLRT https://t.co/3zLP0Wns1M
What’s paid prioritization? Paid prioritization would allow ISPs to create internet fast lanes that would make their preferred content faster than the rest of the internet. https://t.co/W3appT3xtr

With improved patent quality, the United States can remain the world's innovation capital, ensuring that companies are free to invest, grow, and create jobs for years to come.
Robust IPR procedures are as critical today as when Congress passed the #AmericaInventsAct, and any weakening of IPR will increase litigation, especially against small companies least able to fight back.
The IPR process allows Americans to challenge low quality patents issued by the @USPTO. Patents overturned by IPR should never have been issued in the first place. https://t.co/GFI1y9kQKv
