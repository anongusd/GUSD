Excuse typos 😬 moving fast. 😜🥰
The bottom line is this: we’ve heard case after case after case after case of all kinds survivors of violence: sexual, racial and more. if those people are ever to become whole again, it starts with believing them when they tell us what broke them. 		That is our work @MeTooMVMT
We cannot on the one hand say we believe survivors, then on the other turn around and use isolated incidents to prove an epidemic doesn’t actually exist. 		“Well there was a girl who lied on a guy once in HS so people don’t always tell the truth!” 		No, but the mostly do.
Im just wondering are we more invested in the ‘gotcha’ moment of catching someone in a falsehood then we are in avenging the suffering of silent survivors and those who came before? If so, what does that ultimately say about who we are and who we want to be?
But, be clear, when we say *believe* survivors be clear that it means START with the premise that folks aren’t lying and then handle the disclosure with the seriousness and gravity it deserves.
As we create a world where we believe survivors, its easy to get distracted by the rare case of false reporting (between 2-10%). And when it happens it is a clear violation of the trust of those closest to the person involved and the community. Full stop.
By saying *believe* survivors be clear that it means START with the premise that folks aren’t lying and then handle the disclosure with the seriousness and gravity it deserves until a satisfactory solution is reached.
While we, as a culture, can make policy gains or begin to change the conversation around sexual assault, shifting a core culture of disbelief and denial around sexual assault is essential to creating safe spaces for survivors to speak up and speak out when they are ready.
If you take the brave step to say that your bodily autonomy was violated, we choose to believe you because in doing so, we help folks claim the power over what happens with and to their bodies.
We say ‘believe survivors’ because it is the first step toward transformation and because it requires empathy but it also, often, expands our understanding of what bodily autonomy looks like.
There’s lots of reasons why people often choose not to believe survivors. Thinking they are making it up wholesale or not recognizing what happened to them as a violation (even though they are telling you it is)	are a couple of reasons.
The reality is that one of the biggest hurdles in speaking up is a central question: will anyone believe me?
I’ve always said this movement was about centering survivors and not about scandals, no matter what the headlines say. Before you ask, see my ted talk here in case you’re looking for how I talk about this work. 	https://t.co/EEbU8RrkFb

These stories are real. These people are real. See them, Hear them, Believe them. Let’s get to work.
Young Black girls are routinely made to feel complicit in the abuse they experience in their own relationships. Emily talks about her experience of being freed from that toxic idea through community and movement. https://t.co/FvhJR4GqYR
In a submission close to my heart, a Black gay man tells the story of speaking up, then letting go. Many of us experience violence in our own communities and don’t find justice or healing in traditional ways. He gives us a peek into his journey: https://t.co/BxqCX6Hhz1
My friend @terrycrews talks about his experience in choosing to speak out. In his words, survivors are often silenced because they are seen as problems that need to be eradicated. He talks about pushing past that and I’m grateful for his bravery. https://t.co/in0EFuPERX
We asked survivors to talk about their own journeys to healing. And they generously agreed. We’ve taken care to limit graphic depictions. We don't produce trauma for consumption. We’re proud of the work, but please don’t feel obligated to watch (or watch alone) if it’s too much
When you hear #metoo often people envision a powerful perpetrator ducking accountability. Instead, we should imagine a survivor on their path to healing and what we all must do to clear the way. If we are more invested in following scandals, we will never truly SEE survivors.
Today, I’m excited to launch our Survivor Stories on a number of digital platforms, a suite of powerful videos produced with @DeutschInc that feature the journeys of individual survivors. See the announcement on Refinery29 here: https://t.co/5Y63RvsUEy

@Mike_5150_ @MovieBuffChick1 @drboycewatkins1 No, it took a documentary for folks to LISTEN to us. Yes, Black women have been his biggest supporters and Black women have also been the LOUDEST voices condemning his actions. We come in different shapes and sizes you know.
@JamesJdcxc @LegisEmpress @drboycewatkins1 Much appreciated 💕🙏🏾
@rholley504 @drboycewatkins1 I did not say that - I said why is it my job to go after white men - meaning I’m accountable to my community first. CLEARLY white men have been called to task this past year. And now you’re saying get more of them forget about us!
@rholley504 @MillennialEdit1 @drboycewatkins1 Was R. Kelly? So far all he’s lost is his job.
@LegisEmpress @drboycewatkins1 I want to leave this argument alone but Im so stunned that it’s happening. I’m floored by the logic and the complete erasure or Black women from the narrative. That I am subject of vile attacks for uplifting Black women and centering our pain and stories for once.
@LegisEmpress @drboycewatkins1 You’re mad about the RK doc? Ask yourself why. It took 20 yrs, countless articles, investigations and law suits, a national movement and THREE documentaries to shed light on the violence these Black women experienced as girls. It took 2 articles to bring down Weinstein.
@LegisEmpress @drboycewatkins1 These #firstthem folks are attacking me like I haven’t spent the greater part of my life in service or Black folks. There is not a bone in my body that hates Black men OR that would intentionally target them for attack. But we have to have a REAL conversation.
@LegisEmpress @drboycewatkins1 For the sake of your own babies. In EVERY community crime is enacted upon those in closest proximity which means if we know Black women experience sexual violence then it is happening largely at the hands of Black men so when do we get accountability?
@LegisEmpress @drboycewatkins1 I have said OVER AND OVER again - there is no special depravity in our community. Black men have been subjected to a long, painful history or false accusations at the hands of mostly white women. That is undeniable. But @drboycewatkins1 do the research please brother.
@LegisEmpress @drboycewatkins1 You’re telling me, even as a father of 2 BLACK daughters, that you agree with the stance that Black men *who are predators* shouldn’t be held accountable until white men are? If your child said ‘daddy this man did this to me’ your response would be ‘yes baby...but white men’🤔
@LegisEmpress @drboycewatkins1 This argument is SO invalid for a number of reasons: 	1. There is no evidence of Black men being taken down or destroyed. 	2. This movement isn’t about the perpetrators. It’s about the survivors. 	3. ***what about BLACK WOMEN??*** 		No one answers that question ever.
@LegisEmpress @drboycewatkins1 Explain why when Black women have come forward with allegations of harassment or abuse at the hands of prominent Black men the white media, white celebs, and white feminists have largely ignored them. Name the prominent Black men who #MeToo has destroyed.
@LegisEmpress @drboycewatkins1 ...and also if these white women want to use #MeToo to *destroy* Black men — why hasn’t it happened? Why have there been over 200 cases of men losing status, jobs, positions, etc... and the only Black men folks can point to are RK and Cosby whose case predates the viral hashtag.
@LegisEmpress @drboycewatkins1 How? How is it that watching Black women talk about abuse at the hands of ONE Black man - whose life does not mirror that of 99% of Black men in America - cast suspicion on ALL Black men? There was no mention of his race as a factor, there was no mention of Black men as a whole.
@kathygriffin Thank you 🙏🏾 💕

I’m exhausted and frustrated watching Black folks accuse me of being a traitor for wanting to protect Black girls. I just wish some of y’all would admit that when you say Black ppl you mean Black men. 😔		“...because I love you I get the least of you.” - Nikki Giovanni 💕
@SirbobbyX @ogunspirit Brother - they ALL should go to jail. But by your logic Black men should not be accountable until white men are. How does that make sense? If there is a predator i. Your community you don’t want them out?
@SirbobbyX @ogunspirit Again, most of those white men you listed have *already* lost jobs, status etc...what exactly do you want me to do? Meanwhile WEINSTEIN is the face of sexual violence and most of his victims are white. Calling out RK is standing up for Black girls. How is that wrong.
@SirbobbyX @ogunspirit Who was skipped over? Look at all of these white men who were ‘taken down’ this year. I’m so confused - honestly - at how they were skipped by us? Or me? The ONLY Black man you all have seen me mention on here is RK and now I protect white men? How??
@PhallyScott @MiikyoT @ogunspirit Y’all are SO crazy. 😳
@TuneZanotti_206 @MiikyoT @ogunspirit What money?!  Can you call them and let them know they are behind in some payments please? Thanks!
@SirbobbyX @ogunspirit Russell Simmons, AJ Calloway, Anthony Anderson, Morgan Freeman - all had #metoo news stories about them this year that largely went unnoticed. RK has been a predator for years. Why does it *hurt* to see him held accountable?
@SirbobbyX @ogunspirit I don’t work at the behest of white folks and never have. Yes, my work supports all survivors, but my life has been dedicated to Black folks and esp Black girls. Who besides RK do you see me talking about? The truth is if white folks were targeting a Black men they’d be done.
@SirbobbyX @ogunspirit For over a year Black women and other WOC have had very little discussion of the sexual violence we face regularly. Our stories have been over shadowed mostly. So getting RK in the forefront was an effort to get the stories of Black girl trauma seen for once.
@dj16600775 @SirbobbyX @ogunspirit Is RK in handcuffs or just in the news?
@SirbobbyX @ogunspirit These white men who had assaulted and harassed white women were the only topic of discussion for a year. Bill Cosby’s case happened to fall in the last year but had been underway so he wasn’t a result of #MeToo. But outside of him most was about white men.
@SirbobbyX @ogunspirit Ok, you seem to be rational so let’s rap a taste. 	With full acknowledgment that every thing you said is TRUE (adding that   Black WOMEN are also targeted by those things). From the moment #MeToo went viral our news cycles,	magazines, newspapers, etc have been filled w/ white men
@SirbobbyX @ogunspirit Tell me what I’m missing? You’re saying first white men should be dealt with before Black men are - is that right? If not, please enlighten me.
@ByrdsongKellie @ogunspirit I said where were YOU ALL. Meaning those coming in my page with this BS now. As long as I’m talking about white men you’re ok, but bring up a Black man and I’m against the whole race/re: Black men. 	Answer me this: do you think Black men don’t rape?
@Ayiti12 @ogunspirit Yes. And I stand against them too. Again, where was this brigade when we were fighting Daniel Holtzclaw. Or better yet where were y’all when white police were brutalizing Black women. Then it was ...but what about Black men. When is it ever about Black women??
@JamilahLemieux Thank you. This is sooooo ridiculous. Why is so hard to accept that some - not ALL - Black men can be predators? In particular against Black women.
@MiikyoT @ogunspirit And what should Black women who have been victims of Black men do in the meantime?
@ogunspirit So where were all of y’all #FIRSTTHEM folks when I was calling out Tony Robbins or Henry Canvill? In fact where were y’all when we were seeking justice for Daniel Holtzclaw’s BLACK victims. Why are you willing to die on this hill for ONE Black man vs. dozens of Black girls?
@Ricky_Francis @ogunspirit Your argument is ridiculous on so many levels but mainly bc it took 20 years, countless articles, lawsuits and court cases, a national movement, a book and THREE documentaries to get folks to hold RK accountable. It took 2 articles for Weinstein and those other white men. Two.
@Ricky_Francis @ogunspirit What you’re saying is as long as there are white men who go ‘unpunished’ for sexual violence Black men shouldn’t be held accountable for their sexual violence. Does that *honestly* make sense? 	Also, all of this talking you #FirstThem folks are doing do you follow me?
@Ricky_Francis @ogunspirit And I’ll ask you the same question I always ask and have yet to get a sensible answer. When you say Black people do you mean Black men? Bc I’m curious as to what Black women should be doing while we are FIRST making sure white men get their due? Why not Both/And?
@Ricky_Francis @ogunspirit You said *my relevance comes from White society* and me too didn’t get relevance to the main steam, yes, but ask the young girls and women whose lives have been affected over the last 12 yrs. how relevant the work is. Again - MY relevance doesn’t come from what white folks think.
🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️ https://t.co/E84nFlQujm
@Ricky_Francis @ogunspirit You are so deeply ignorant brother. Unlike YOU my relevance is not rooted in white folks seeing me or recognizing my work. MY relevance doesn’t come from anything white. It comes from the WORK I’ve done in my community and beyond. I don’t need white folks - or your validation.
@ogunspirit You can keep your #firstthem BS on your timeline and chop it up with all 9 of your followers.	On this page it’s #survivorsfirst and #BlackwomenALWAYS		Now carry on with your foolishness elsewhere. I got tjme today and a long leash. You can all catch this smoke.
@ogunspirit Let me run through your time line and see if you were up in arms protesting against Daniel Holtzclaw? Huh, before y’all knew me or MeToo were you so passionate about making sure white men who harmed Black girls were accountable? Huh?
@ogunspirit And again - answer me this. WHEN SHOULD BLACK MEN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR PREDATORY BEHAVIOR?! And why is it MY job to ‘go after’ white men? Since when is standing up for Black women and girls anti-Black?
@ogunspirit So let me get this straight. There were more than 200 white men who lost jobs and status this year as a result of #MeToo. There are lawsuits and court cases and news specials and documentaries about a number of them but ***I’m*** letting them off the hook bc what now?

@TheInfluence14 Not to mention that a number of these white men who you listed have had consequences to their actions: Weinstein, Lauer, Rose, and others have lost their jobs. NOTHING more has happened to R. Kelly. He lost his job. So there’s you’re equality. It happened to #THEMFIRST 🙃
@TheInfluence14 So tell me...what should Black women and girls do while we are FIRST dealing with white male predators? By this logic we should sit on our hands and wait until ALL the problematic white men are ‘dealt with’ before we lift a finger or raise our voices about Black male predators.

Tonight is the final night of #SurvivingRKelly and I hope you all are tuning in. I know the last two nights have been a lot and I know those of us who are committed to this work and those of us who have survived sexual violence have had a tough time but I’m glad you stayed.

@Leisha578950321 What are you saying? I know you’re not blaming her.
@naima No doubt.
@brownblaze LOL, yeah, same with Beyonce. Remember when it was floating around that she was born in 76 at one point which would make her 44 now not 37.
@brownblaze I was thinking the same thing, lol
@daniecal not that this is anymore reliable than wiki but this says '73. I feel like I remember that me, her, and Faith were the same age. 		https://t.co/Qzsw6ylULf
@daniecal Im almost sure me and Misa are the same age (45). We were coming up in NY around the same time. Let me do some checking though...lawd.
@Jusur_Type Being RAPED or MOLESTED as a child is not the same as losing your virginity. Are you serious?
@TerriLLloyd @FLLWMELIKEJESUS This is awful. She was FOURTEEN. She didn't *prey* on him. She sought him out like teenage fans do. HE is the one who saw and manipulated her vulnerability. HE is the one who engaged in sex with a MINOR. She is blameless. She was a child. Have we NO compassion for black girls.
@InejAlina Yes, @lifetimetv has set up counseling services for the survivors during and after and they are on call for them now.
T.H.I.S. https://t.co/t4M2ZudnxX
Please keep these survivors in your hearts and minds as you watch the #SurivingRKelly doc series. It took a LOT to come forward and tell these stories and now that they have they are out there and have to deal with folks sitting in judgement of their lives.

Let me say this to Black folks who are saying foolishness like this. 		Shut up. 		It has taken 20 YEARS to get the mainstream media to shine light on his depravity. He is not FACE of sexual assault. He is the subject of a doc that allows his survivors to be heard...finally. https://t.co/9jMAUdxlwG

@J45Elissa Like my ex who bought my first cell phone and would rage when I didn’t answer the phone - even if I was at work or in class.
Also, can we just let this women deal in her own way at her own pace? 🙄		#LETCARDIB
Some little girl with an ex bringing carnations up to the check out line and screaming “take me back!!” is going to get his feelings hurt and it won’t end well for HER!
Few things are more scary than a rejected man with a bruised ego. 		We are literally watching this slow moving train and regardless of how Cardi responds moving forward we can’t let this kind of behavior go unchecked.
Point is - we could flood the timelines with these ‘crazy supposed to be *love* stories and folks will still find reasons why what Offset did wasn’t “that bad” or was a grand gesture of love. Question I have is: what happens when he’s tired of apologizing and being rejected.
In college a guy chased an ex down with his car and ended up ‘accidentally’ running her car off the road became be wanted to talk and she wouldn’t listen. She broke two ribs. He came to the hospital with mad flowers and apologies and her mom convinced her to take him back.
In another incident, also in high school, my homegirl’s man pulled a gun on us bc he thought she was cheating and made a whole scene in the subway. We dismissed it like “he’s so crazy girl - you can’t EVER leave him! He’s so in LOVE with you!
I had an ex who once asked me to meet on the roof of his building to talk (common in old NY) and when I got there he pulled out a gun and threatened to shoot me and then jump if I didn’t agree to get back together. 	I was 16. The high drama and attention felt like love.
All up and down my timeline there are debates and opinions about Offset’s shenanigans at the Cardi snow yesterday. The thing that stands out the most is how many women have been there. So many of us have ‘crazy ex’ stories that were a ‘little scary’ but ended up ok - kinda.
Basically. 🐒 https://t.co/n6kUmeVaaF

@natashaapple_ What?!?
@melindagates The @MeTooMVMT is not about the accused. And it’s not just for women. Articles like this consistently leave survivors out of the conversation,	both in numbers and needs. Our work is all about action - to support the people who actually said #metoo

@Alyssa_Milano Thank you. 💕
I am so excited to show you all what we've been up to for the last year!! This week we will be rolling out some of those things to share with you. I hope you are excited too!! #MeToomvmt
Thank you to everyone who has shown me so much love and support this year. I hope that I represent and stand for survivors of sexual violence in a way that makes you proud. Please know that our work is never ending. In fact its just beginning. +
I have wondered a lot this year why God chose to give me this platform and why I was trusted to shoulder this responsibility and every time I ask the question the answer shows up in a different way. I am not questioning anymore I am just grateful.
The whole time I was fretting about saving my work and I didn't realize that 'my work' was happening right in front of me.
My work has always centered Black and Brown women and girls. And it always will - but at the heart of it all it supports ALL survivors of sexual violence. And I committed to that work a long time ago so watching people open up with what felt like no covering online was hard. +
On the other hand - I was watching thousands of survivors pour their hearts out across social media with no container to process, no support and no one really helping to walk them through disclosure or uplift the power of community for survivors. +
One story in particular hit me hard. It was a woman's story or being assaulted on her college campus and it resonated so deeply with me. I was on the one hand fielding calls from my girls like "whatchu wanna do??" they were ready for a fight to make sure I wasn't erased. +
The short answer, No. But I was definitely in danger of being erased if YOU ALL Black women and our allies and friends, didn't speak up. But something else happened too. I watched for hours that first day as more and more stories poured out across social media from survivors. +
The most interesting thing happened over the next 24 hours. I posted a video of me giving a speech about #metoo from 2014 and that went viral. And then people began to get confused - had "white hollywood" tried to steal this from a Black woman?!?
I didn't know that @Alyssa_Milano sent out the first tweet until the following day. And that is when she found out about @MeTooMVMT and reached out to me. She tweeted an apology and posted our website and asked how she could amplify our work. +
Enter - the Sisters. Black women who knew my work and supported me over the years raised up in arms - namely @bevysmith @BritniDWrites @Luvvie @KWestSavali @MyBrownBaby @fiyawata @afrobella and many more! They activated a network and the support came from everywhere.
I remember calling my friends frantic and trying to figure out what to do. I didn't know whether to go online and say - THIS ALREADY EXISTS! Or to just let it go, but then I realized letting it go wasn't an option in this moment.
A year ago today I thought my world was falling apart. I woke up to find out that the hashtag #metoo had gone viral and I didn't see any of the work I laid out over the previous decade attached to it. I thought for sure I would be erased from a thing I worked so hard to build. + https://t.co/VmfwTxhcIo

@MsPackyetti @peshkac Such bullshit.
And so whether he is confirmed or not the scars she has are still there. in fact, she walks away with w me MORE wounds. This isn’t her burden to bear. She is the one who should be protected and if the government won’t do it then we will. We will stand up for her and stand by her.
I want to continuously scream this from the rooftops: THIS IS A SURVIVORS MOVEMENT!!! We will not let Dr. Blasey Ford’s experiences be invalidated by partisan nonsense. We are survivors not just bc we lived through what happened but bc we are in a constant state of SURVIVAL!
The danger in this narrative that they are pushing is it makes it look like these are unrelated issues when in fact SO MANY folks who used #metoo where talking about experiences from their youth they never spoke about until now.
The Right is attempting to separate Dr. Blasey Ford’s story from @MeTooMVMT which is ridiculous. They want you to believe it’s just about powerful men being called out - when it fact there would be no MOVEMENT if EVERYDAY people didn’t speak up and out. https://t.co/MM3dwUd6xN

@CM07588872 Oh I’m so sure. This ain’t racial by any means. There are predators and predatory behavior everywhere!
Anyway, I won’t go on and on. I’m glad folks called it out and there is discussion about ALL of the misogyny we witnessed yesterday. I’m just gonna add...this is why we have to dig into sexual violence in our community openly and honestly from all sides. #therearelayers
When I lived in Selma I met many elders from the Movement. They almost *always* found a way to hold me close or squeeze me in some way. I started calling it the Civil Rights hug. 	Some of y’all know just what I mean.
What we witnessed yesterday in this moment was immediately recognized by women everywhere. It’s in your face but subtle, it’s demeaning but ‘a joke’, it’s love from an elder but it’s an abuse of power. So many of us are so conditioned that we saw it, cringed and moved on. #metoo https://t.co/nX2SPSGEr6

@CorgisforLove What everyone else said. I hope you find some solace in the chorus of diverse voices. There is no one kind of survivor. 💕
@jimlucas1963 @TomArnold The point of a movement is for ALL of the people in it to have a voice. I speak out on a lot of issues and some I miss or let others speak out on. It should be clear that anybody who is working to end sexual violence feels strongly about these issues.
@PhotoandGrime @jojofudge I will - we definitely have to address grooming in society in general.
People will use these recent news stories to try and discredit this movement - don’t let that happen. This is what Movement is about. It’s not a spectator sport. It is people generated. We get to say “this is/isn’t what this movement is about!”
...and there is no model survivor. 	We are imperfectly human and we all have to be accountable for our individual behavior.
A shift can happen. This movement is making space for possibility. But, it can only happen after we crack open the whole can of worms and get really comfortable with the uncomfortable reality that there is no one way to be a perpetrator.
My hope is that as more folks come forward, particularly men, that we prepare ourselves for some hard conversations about power and humanity and privilege and harm. This issue is less about crime &amp; punishment and more about harm and harm reduction.
...and begin to talk about power. Sexual violence is about power and privilege. That doesn’t change if the perpetrator is your favorite actress, activist or professor of any gender. 	And we won’t shift the culture unless we get serious about shifting these false narratives.
I’ve said repeatedly that the  #metooMVMT is for all of us, including these brave young men who are now coming forward. It will continue to be jarring when we hear the names of some of our faves connected to sexual violence unless we shift from talking about individuals [+]
@HKhodai @ReignOfApril That ‘grinding nemo’ literally took me out. https://t.co/Tb5osAVsz4
@iSmashFizzle Yes, girl! We rapped for about an *hour* and had a wonderfully nuanced conversation about everything from sexual violence in the Black community to police violence to hip-hop to abstinence! He’s pretty brilliant/wise at just 25 y.o. and committed to evolving. I really dug him!

For those who don’t know Lopate is a long time radio host fired from WNYC last year after an investigation into YEARS of sexual misconduct towards women. @WBAI decided they were ok with that and gave him another show. 😡

Our work is about supporting survivors by providing resources for healing and action. If in the course of that process a perpetrator is held accountable for their actions - so be it. But our goal is not to ‘take down’ individuals it’s to dismantle systems that give them cover.
And be clear there are still MILLIONS of people around the world who are still silent. Who STILL don’t feel safe enough to share their experiences and the mischaracterization in the media is a DISSERVICE to them.
Women have been speaking up for years about harassment and abuse.  #metoo has just created cover for those who didn’t feel safe enough to speak up. The movement didn’t *create* the concept of speaking out. it just allowed people to hear us better as a chorus and not a solo.
The fact is these people brought THEMSELVES down with their own behavior. The movement is about people owning their truth and releasing the shame associated with sexual violence. That is not a NEW concept. What’s new is that there is some accountability now.
@BdIdeaFairy HUGE. And exhausting is an understatement 🤦🏾‍♀️
The #1 complaint I hear is that #metooMVMT is a witch hunt like there is some master hit list we are checking off as we ‘take out’ man after man. It’s so FALSE! But people believe what they READ! So if they are reading about ‘take downs’ and ‘snares’ that becomes the narrative
These headlines and quotes are just a few. I’m sure if there was actual research done there are hundreds more like this. I wish I could really make mainstream media understand how dangerous this language and posturing is for survivors of sexual violence and harassment. #metooMVMT

Thank you #AndreaConstand and the dozens of women who stood up - together to tell their truth about #BillCosby. 		You are what this movement is all about. 💕 		#metooMVMT
@YoloAkili @chaninicholas Adore her! 💕
This is ...a lot. 		So many folks have similar stories. Most don’t even involve drugs just precarious situations and split second decisions. 		This woman is brave to do this on national TV. @tvkatesnow is doing a good job. #AndreaConstand #metoo #supportsurvivors
@naima We don’t call Teddy’s name enough!
@maryconquest Why thank you Mary Conquest. 😊
Maybe I’ll live tweet it... 🤔
If you are a survivor struggling in this moment, maybe skip this one and take care of yourself. 		If you are looking for ways to be an ally, watch and practice listening and connecting with what you hear. 		💕
3. There were more than just white women who he sexually assaulted. 		And hold on to your hats...		4. HE ADMITTED HIS GUILT		In a deposition from 2005 he admitted to drugging and raping her. 		Anyway, please watch tonight.
People need to be clear about a few things: 		1. His case was about a rape he committed in THIS MILLENIUM, not 20/30/40 yrs ago. It happened in 2004. 		2. The women who came forward from years past established a pattern of abuse but they weren’t the reason why she was on trial.
Survivors please note: 	IT COULD BE TRIGGERING TO WATCH		I was taken off guard and I only saw moments of it. 		But it’s so necessary to hear her voice. Listen to her story in her own words. There is still SO MUCH false information going around about Cosby. Maybe this will help.
This is the clip from yesterday: 	*trigger warning*		https://t.co/qLVoYYNXVr
Tonight at 10PM folks need to watch @DatelineNBC for this exclusive with @tvkatesnow interviewing the women ACTUALLY in the center of the Cosby trial #AndreaConstand. I saw clips yesterday. It is gut wrenching. #metoomvmt #supportsurvivors
“Lack of power”. This isn’t just about power outages. It’s about power structures like racism, colonialism based on total lack of regard for Black &amp; Brown lives. https://t.co/Nm8bCqOoIc
Can we talk about this though...	Almost 5,000 DEAD!? 		I remember @rosaclemente telling me back in Jan. that the numbers were skewed bc she saw more death with her own two eyes than what was being reported. 		...and folks are still suffering in PR. 	#dontforgetPR #signalboost https://t.co/up45RmbHde

Update: 		https://t.co/xCpgkEKKVi
Update: 		https://t.co/xCpgkEKKVi
I also don’t regret supporting this sister’s claims. Unfortunately, they didn’t seem far fetched. There is a lesson here in pacing ourselves perhaps but I will continue to show up for survivors of sexual violence and definitely Black women.
Human behavior is a mystery. I don’t know why people make the decisions that they do, but individual behavior doesn’t define the race.
It is my sincere hope that we can be nuanced enough to see this woman’s lie as her INDIVIDUAL ACT and not weaponize it to use against all Black women or similar claims from women of color.
The other truth here is Black women are often left out of the national narrative on police brutality. We’ve seen case after case that price that. Like #ChikesiaClemons and the case at Waffle House. That is why #Sayhername was necessary.
It is still true that sexual misconduct is the second most reported complaint behind excessive force in this country. Daniel Holzclaw showed us the horror of police using their power to sexually assault Black women in particular.
I want to say a few things before the onslaught of “SEE THEY ALL LIE!!” starts pouring in. Yes, this is awful and the officer deserves and apology. I am definitely sorry for harm it’s caused him and his family. 	But also, we’re not just proactive based on nothing.
Before you all ask here is the footage: 		https://t.co/qxx2qoRj1B
Ok, so here we are. 		The body cam footage clears #OfficerHubbard of all wrong doing in this case. Based on what we see in the video #SheritaColeDixon was not telling the truth about her arrest. 		Her attorney has issued a statement. 	But we have to talk... https://t.co/YYukqwpCwZ
According to an 07 report prepared for the U. N.  Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, “rape and sexual abuse by police [in the United States] are primarily reported by women of color.” 		Thank you @KWestSavali always on the job. 		#sayhername #SheritaDixonCole https://t.co/1kBWdrNJ2H
@KWestSavali Thank you, sis. Folks always asking questions before just :30 of research.
Literally just found out about this story. It made me physically ill. This is why we can’t leave Black women out of the police brutality narrative. The second highest complaint against police officers is sexual violence. #metooMVMT #metoo https://t.co/bDHEH5t7hL
🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️🙅🏾‍♀️ #shehasmysupport #bx https://t.co/Fkg9Pb7ovj
@plumwats OMG, Paige. That makes me want to cry. I hate that this is so many of our realities and not just unemployed or poor people, but the working poor most especially. Folks with no living wages...anyway. I’m preaching to the choir I know.
@janieeden @TheRomanceCo I got a bill for $725 for an ambulance ride for my daughter when they were 8 - so 12 years ago. I know that’s at least double now. I have never called an ambulance since. And I have seen folks doubled over in pain, barely breathing who demand that you DON’T call one. 😐
@bevysmith And I mean he’s just singing. Like he’s not curing cancer, or eradicating violence in the hood, even Cosby at least donated millions to the betterment of Black life and provided us with positivity for decades so I get mourning him - but this clown ain’t even Luther. #muteRkelly

@MsPackyetti I know! I felt that. It randomly came across my mind today and really warmed my heart. Sisters *consistently* hold me down. Wouldn’t be here without us. 💕
More random: I love Black women. It’s just so false to think we don’t love/support each other. I met @MsPackyetti for the first time and that sister gave me a hug and said “We’re praying for you. If you need anything...” That same scenario has happened so many times. ❤️🖤💚
@chernlikechurn Oh really?? I didn't know the did that! Interesting.
Random: Thinking about how many folks in the hood (especially down south) who won't call an ambulance - even in an emergency - because it's too expensive. *sigh* inhumane.

@ReignOfApril @EBONYMag I'm so confused by women, Black women especially who take this posture. Like, what?? Just say you like him and don't care what he's done. Or that Black girls actually *don't* matter. But this "...but, but, but what about Dewhyte Man!!" argument is so lame.
@tferg3 @TwitterMoments @ReignOfApril @TIMESUPNOW I don't understand. So no injustice should be stopped unless they all stop simultaneously. What do you suggest happens here sis? Leave R. Kelly alone until all white men come to justice? I'm so curious about this position. Especially from a Black woman.
@HaroldPerrineau @TIMESUPNOW Appreciate that brother. Our community is so split when it comes to sexual violence and we have to stand in solidarity to move the needle and change the narrative in this moment. Sincerely grateful for your support. 🤲🏾

@IAmSophiaNelson @SybilWilkes ...and what's happening to young Black girls and women in this country just the same as our white counterparts.' 		@SybilWilkes : I agree.

@IAmSophiaNelson Yes, I know about all of that sis...but it’s all in the last six months. We don’t have to keep bashing this out online. I’ll await your DM. We can talk whenever.
@sofiaquintero Thank you Sophia. It’s exhausting. But it’s why I’m all over the country trying to set the record straight and recruit people for the work we are doing NOW.
I am not above reproach or criticism but it’s not helpful to just criticize. It’s literally going to take all of us to put an end to sexual violence and oust people like R. Kelly from the protection of fame.
This work started for us and by us and will always center Black women and WOC along with all of the groups whose voices we don’t hear enough from including Trans/GNC folk, disabled folk, folks from low wealth communities, etc...
You know the last thing I want to do is have a public beef with another sister but I could NOT let that go without speaking up. It pains me when people acknowledge me as founder of #metooMVMT but say Black women aren’t included. 🤷🏾‍♀️
I applaud you and your life’s work for Black women. And I don’t mean to disturb you while you’re in mourning but if you are serious about doing something about R. Kelly calling out your ALLIES isn’t the way to start. Have the day of your choosing. 💁🏾‍♀️ https://t.co/Ehqb0Hmzpf
That’s nice. I know about your book. But I ain’t heard head or tale from you sis - SPECIFICALLY- about this. My point is don’t go on a national program asking me to ‘step it up’ if you’re not doing the work. Or don’t know the work being done. https://t.co/VlkxPI7o1t
Ma’am. I have been trying to TAKE THIS MAN DOWN FOR A DECADE. Where have you BEEN??? https://t.co/5Nb9jjZn4e
Telling me *I* need to step up isn’t a call out? What are you calling the #metooMVMT? If the work I do daily isn’t the MVMT what is? You have allowed mainstream media to define the movement for you - that is why you’re lost. https://t.co/WfCxbDQ2XP
@IAmSophiaNelson I am glad you have decided to get on board - hopefully that means you will use your national platform to speak out about the pervasiveness of sexual violence against Black Women &amp; Girls and WOC. I can’t wait to see what you come up with, sis! 🙇🏾‍♀️
I’m not going to make this a long rant but I will not let you disparage my reputation for standing up for and with Black women and girls because YOU just decided to join US. @LegisEmpress @DeeshaDyer @BlackWomensBP @JamilahLemieux to name a few have BEEN at this @IAmSophiaNelson
I don’t want to have to pull out a decade of receipts but I will gladly do that since you couldn’t be bothered to do your homework. Not only have I been talking about, writing about, organizing about ousting R. Kelly in the last six months but for over a DECADE. @IAmSophiaNelson
My question to you, sis @IAmSophiaNelson - we’ll I have two: 	1. Where have you been? 	2. What have you done? 		#metooMVMT
She said being on magazine covers and all was nice but myself and other Black women in the #metooMVMT weren’t doing enough for Black women and girls particularly around R. Kelly 👩🏾‍💻
So, yesterday on @TJMShow @jacquereid had @IAmSophiaNelson on about R. Kelly’s latest charges and Ms. Nelson saw fit to call me out saying *I* need to ‘step it up’ and START giving voice to Black women and young Black women’s issues around sexual violence in this country.
@DebraMessing 😍😍😍
@TessaThompson_x Thank you, sis!! Same here 😍

@justypooxx20 No, I will remember how generous you all were as an audience and how a sweet elder bought me cough drops and a HS Jr said I inspire her to be an activist. Those crazies won’t ruin my memories of Akron. I promise! 💕
I’m just sharing 1) to have a public record I guess 2) so if some weird chopped up video comes out you have my side 3) to say I am VERY human. I am trying my best to navigate this newfound visibility with grace and integrity. But I won’t ever respond well to foolishness. #ImsoBX
He runs up to the car and I jump in the passenger seat and pull off, but I have to say I was unnerved. Folks are CRAZY out here and although I have had some awful threats, I have had few upclose situations like this.
Well...I stay about 30-40 mins taking pics and talking to folks and then I leave the building. The woman and her husband are WAITING BY RIDE IN THE PARKING LOT! He runs up to me with a camera and starts yelling “why did you allow my wife to get assaulted!” +
She yells some more stuff and I tell the moderator to take her mic and let’s move on. Security escorts her out. I apologize to the audience who then starts clapping for me, but I really feel bad...i hate to lose my cool like that.
I regret saying shut up. I really do...but she was ON ONE. And so I say, “don’t come in here asking about Bill Clinton’s accusers being the original silence breakers if you don’t mention Anita Hill! I don’t want to hear it. We’re both yelling now. 😐
I say...well I guess I know who you voted for...and then I attempt to answer her question but she starts screaming. So I’m saying “be quiet and let me answer your question if you really want an answer...” but she’s still yelling. So I say ‘lady shut up!’ 😒
She starts screaming out the names Bill Clinton’s accusers and says am I afraid that the #metoo movement has become too partisan and why these women weren’t names as Silence Breakers in Time magazine. By now she’s screaming. +
So...I had a little ‘incident’ tonight and I’m gonna his ahead and share it myself. 	I spoke at the U of Akron tonight to a wonderful, generous crowd who put up with my hacking cough bc I’m sick. 	During Q&amp;A a woman gets up holding a camera phone on me while asking a question +

@terrycrews 🙏🏾💕
@jsmooth995 @technologypoet And I didn’t leave out any context. I didn’t talk to them. I said they TRIED. My eyes and ears provide all of the context I need. 	Appreciate you trying though. You clearly got something out of it. So there’s that! 🙂
@jsmooth995 @technologypoet You said yourself he was wrong. That’s it. That’s the extent of it. No one is taking anything from him but he’s gon’ get these critiques. You’re focused on the most negative - but most are saying he’s wrong and hurtful to survivors and that’s true.
@jsmooth995 @technologypoet You expect folks to believe it was just ‘poor communication’ and ‘wrong choice of words’ on his part but not indicative of his character after watching that longer clip. Nothing you said here makes what we witnessed make sense.
@jsmooth995 @technologypoet He talked about using the @MeTooMVMT to gain significance. What needs to be interrogated is why THAT example when it immediately puts scrutiny on survivors of sexual violence. And why THAT story that is clearly sexist and wrongheaded.
@jsmooth995 @technologypoet Thank you Jay. So I was on a flight and am just seeing this...but this ‘context’ doesn’t change anything. You’re essentially saying he started off making a credible point and then he went off the rails by trying to illustrate that point using probably the worst possible example
@technologypoet @QuatrainGleam Where’s the context thread?
@darrenmcmullen @julsfoley @louern @AkemiLook But you’re right that either interpretation is wrong.
@darrenmcmullen @julsfoley @louern @AkemiLook That could be it too, but him qualifying the woman as ‘very attractive’ adds another layer of complexity I think.

@brendatracy24 @Alyssa_Milano @chrissyteigen @GretchenCarlson @womensmediacntr @womensmarch @JessicaValenti Oh sis, I posted about this! Look at my page. The longer video is disgusting!
@Issa_AbuKhalifa There are a whole spectrum of things that fall under sexual violence. Maybe you need to listen to survivors actual #metoo stories and not what the media has elevated and deem d important. Even many of the Weinstein accusers were talking about violent sexual assault.
@thDigitalReader I posted the longer version on my page.
@juhlsjulie @NanineMcCool @MeTooMVMT @TheButterscotch Bravo to you @NanineMcCool and @TheButterscotch 🙌🏾
@technologypoet Ma’am. He stood in a *convention center* with God knows how many thousands of people and publicly criticized this movement. His livelihood will be fine - but he’s playing with folk’s lives.
@technologypoet YOU said there is six hours of context...I’m responding to you and you’re comment. This is your moment...share. I’d love to hear a few points that give this moment a different meaning. I mean that without sarcasm.
@DebraMessing ...and gross.
@technologypoet And if there is something in those six hours that explains why he is wrongly saying #metooMVMT Is about victimization, that survivors use the movement for significance or NOT excoriating his sexist businessman friend - please share. Give us the missing pieces.
@technologypoet He isn’t being ‘crucified’ he’s being ‘criticized’ - there is a different. He is, like all folks are, entitled to his opinion. But when millions of people are influenced by his  ‘opinion’ he has to be more responsible.
@BuhRayUhh @iMDRW I posted it.
@mochamomma Girl. That made my blood boil. And it was a dumb point!
Great point! https://t.co/LnyRymoE4B
@rolandsmartin @TonyRobbins @rolandsmartin 👀	https://t.co/lgrfY5BU06
@annabell_dec @matthewjdowd First, you have a right to have to whoever you want in your HOME that is not what we’re dealing with here. Tony Robbins wasn’t calling for a discussion he was blaming the movement. Tell me how the conversation is being shut down?
In case you’re interested. Here’s the longer 11 min video of Tony Robbins talking about the @MeTooMVMT: 😐	https://t.co/69MnzK7lHh
@mrsmaris Yeah, she’s amazing. And he’s legit like 7 feet tall. Just the height differential alone was uncomfortable to watch.
@Karnythia  https://t.co/rWslKWhnC7
@TonyRobbins If you talk to more SURVIVORS and less sexist businessmen maybe you’ll understand what we want. We want safety. We want healing. We want accountability. We want closure. We want to live a life free from shame. That’s the reality of the @MeTooMVMT sir, do better.
5. This movement is about making sure survivors have the resources to heal AFTER they’ve said #metoo, it’s about galvanizing a global community or survivors and advocates to do the work of interrupting sexual violence. It’s about protecting folks’ human dignity at all cost.
3. Survivors are not complicit in their own abuse. Speaking our truth is part of healing not a ploy to gain ‘significance’ - bc when does that even HAPPEN?! 		4. Physical intimidation can be a form or harassment. Rewatch that video and then watch your step homie.
Crash course @TonyRobbins: 	1. @MeTooMVMT is NOT about victimization it’s about SURVIVORS		2. Women are not to blame for the deep seeded misogyny that you and men like your ‘friend’ are mired in. 		#metoo
This moment is so damaging especially with how influential @TonyRobbins is. We have a hard enough time trying to shift the narrative about what this movement really is and he stands in front of thousands of his followers and completely misrepresents the @MeTooMVMT
You try to make it seem like it’s ‘just your opinion of SOME people’ saying ‘me too.’ but my question is WHO? Who have you seen using their story of sexual violence for ‘significance’? Name five prominent examples @TonyRobbins - please. I’ll wait.
And he is clear that he won’t apologize so it is what it is. If you choose to keep supporting him it’s with full knowledge of his views on women and survivors.
Oh the video is MUCH worse. His misogyny runs deep. To even repeat that story of his ‘friend’ who wouldn’t hire the ‘pretty woman’ as if it’s the MOVEMENT’s fault and not the sexist man’s fault is all you need to hear. It’s deplorable. But SO many folks misunderstand this work.
I was made aware of this video BEFORE I ever saw it because Tony Robbins people reached out to do damage control within 24 hours. They wanted to “give me context” apparently. I don’t need any. I have eyes. The full video is 11 mins. And it’s gross. Bravo to this woman. https://t.co/gjbm9GF1Mz

@DeeshaDyer That’s all I’m saying sis! We know the problem exists. We can create our own media if that’s what we need to feel validated - but the work of healing ourselves and our communities still has to happen so let’s get to work. 💕
@mzwrightnow @iamcardib @MeTooMVMT THIS. &lt;3
@danibostick But that is my point, sis. Left behind according to WHO? The same energy being used to say they are left out only perpetuates them BEING left out. If you are an advocate with a platform and you are talking about CSA then they are NOT left out. What does being in look like?
Let them know where you stand. NYS Stand Up for children. #metooCSA https://t.co/rm7UY6Z4xd
While I am in a ranting mood...NYS Stand up!! #metooCSA 	(CSA=child sexual abuse) https://t.co/UYhSGw0n3e
We also want to ensure that both survivors and advocates are equipped to do the work of interrupting sexual violence. That is how we are building this movement so that long after the hashtag is out of the news cycle we have a mechanism to continue our work. #metooMVMT
We are building something that has never existed and we will need your help. The work of the #metooMVMT will happen on and off line. We want to make sure survivors have the tools they need to craft their own healing journey...
I have no expectation of mainstream media to tell the stories of marginalized people unless it serves them. But when these groups speak out are our communities ready to stand in the gap? That is how this movement grows. #metooMVMT
I love @iamcardib and I am glad she told her truth - but can we handle it? What WILL we say when Black and Brown women start coming forth with their stories from in the industry and in the hood. Will WE believe them? Will WE support them? #metooMVMT
There is no need to talk about who is 'left out' because nobody has to be left out. This is OUR MOVEMENT! Are we only validated when CNN and MSNBC tells or stories? #metooMVMT
We need #metooMilitary, #metooK12, #metooCSA, #metooONCampus, #metooTGNC, #metooQueer, #metooChurch, #metooBlKChurch, #metooMosque, #metooDisabled, #metooTrafficking, #metooSports, #metooSexWorkers, #metooAroundtheWay, #metooVixens, #metooDateRape, #metooAtWork and so forth...
I fully expect for there to be a thousand spin off hashtags to #metoo but maybe I need to just set it off. WE have to power to tell our own stories and let the media catch up - or not. But us raising our voices has to be enough. #MeTooMVMT
This is a movement for and about survivors. If you let the mainstream media define who the 'survivors' are then we will always only hear about famous, white, cis-gendered women. But they don't own this movement - we do. YOU DO. Survivors need to take ownership. #MeTooMVMT
My thoughts on @iamcardib #MeToo  comments: SHE IS RIGHT. Period.	But also, when it is said that certain groups are 'being left out' it means we are allowing the MEDIA to define the movement. The freedom that these words give mean that anyone can be included. (+) https://t.co/wDmqLjycac

So apparently the footage of Katy Perry kissing the boy was EDITED to look like it was w/o permission - which provides some clarity on why she hasn’t apologized - but what I don’t understand is why American Idol producers would want to make it seem like a creepy, forced kiss? https://t.co/yrSpcd2vsi
@ankurtyagi99 Thank you! This just makes American Idol producers problematic to me then. But thanks for the clarity.
@sofiaquintero Richard Dawson made *me* uncomfortable as a kid too! This was cringe-y to watch. And that flippant ‘sorry!’ At the end irritated me. Folks are right. If this were a man we’d call for his head. It’s gross.

@cdoughertyx2 Thank you. I’m not discouraged just acutely aware. 😊
I’m talking about all of these ‘what’s next’ events that don’t take in to account that the thing that already exists can show you what’s next. I’m talking about becoming a walking BHM fact while others are being brought into spaces to strategize about how to move forward.
Ok, last point bc I see folks misunderstanding me already. This is not about acknowledgment. I have received tons of accolades and I appreciate the opportunities to expand the conversation about supporting survivors. I’m talking about who is setting the agenda for the #metooMVMT
@baileyinbloom Thank you love. 💕
@NicoleCCarlton @Alyssa_Milano I see you sis. The work *I* do sees you and acknowledges you. Don’t get caught up in what the media says this movement is - it is about ALL survivors finding resources to heal and working to interrupt sexual violence.
*deferred 😬
And please don’t make this about @Alyssa_Milano. She has been an ally and friend from the moment she found out. She both acknowledges me as founder and has often differed to my vision and leadership. #metooMVMT #metoo
I’m not trying to ignite debate. I meant it when I said I want to be in service and not conflict, but I have to say it is very posaible to be acknowledged and erased. #watchforthehook #metooMVMT
This is part of my point. If you follow the narrative the media and others have created you won’t see yourself but that is NOT the #metooMVMT 	If you acknowledge the work I put in building this over the last decade than you can’t help but see yourself. #metoo https://t.co/tkcwWdnVTv
Founder is acknowledgment. But watch carefully who are called “leaders” of the movement. It’s as if 25+ years of on the ground movement building work is not enough or maybe spending most of that time being invested in the lives of Black and brown Girls isn’t enough. #metooMVMT
While it’s true that I have been widely recognized as the ‘founder’ of the movement - there is virtually no mention of my leadership. Like I just discovered something 12 years ago and in 2017 it suddenly gained value. #metooMVMT #metoo
I don’t say much online about what is going on with the #metooMVMT because honestly there is so much wrongheaded chatter all of the time I don’t have time to chase it all down. But I’m particularly challenged by this framing in the media #metoo
@JessLivMo @Alyssa_Milano I don’t disagree with that which is why we are building on and offline work to give greater access to people. But I maintain it’s not digital organizing no matter how much people “adopt and remix” it.
@JessLivMo @Alyssa_Milano Not some - lots. That’s why it’s one tool. But I’m not here to debate your understanding vs. mine. Theme too movement only lived online briefly on MySpace out of necessity. Couching under ‘digital organizing’ erases the history.
@JessLivMo @Alyssa_Milano What is your definition?
@JessLivMo @Alyssa_Milano If you are recalling history it is not under digital organizing. It was started on the ground - community organizing. Because it’s been popularized online the interwebs will always be a *tool* but it’s not solely digital organizing campaign.
@JessLivMo @Alyssa_Milano Me too does not fall under digital organizing.

@chilltowntv It really is going to take local, state, national and global action but EVERYone can be active in some way / even if it’s just not tolerating rape jokes! #BlerdDating
@chilltowntv If folks want to make a difference they can continue to talk about this issue from a lens that centers survivors and their needs. #Blerddating
@chilltowntv The me too Movement is not JUST about sexual harassment in the work place and it’s NOT just for women - or more clearly: famous, white, cisgender women. And the ones I know would agree with that. #Blerddating
@chilltowntv The big thing folks can do for us now is help us change the narrative about what the ‘me too.’ Movement actually is. It’s not about taking down powerful men or leading a witch hunt. #BlerdDating
@chilltowntv Volunteer and/or donate at a Rape Crisis Center.
@chilltowntv The RAINN website has a tool that allows you to go online, submit your zip code and find local legislation in your state. Use that tool and then find legislation to get behind. #BlerdDating
@chilltowntv I often tell folks that action starts in your back yard and it’s not all the same but it all counts. Do you know the policy for vetting paraprofessionals at your child’s school? Maybe an action is finding out #BlerdDating
@chilltowntv Here’s my FAVORITE question. The work of the me too MVMT is in part helping people become active in the fight to end sexual violence. It’s not about the things the media says it is... so if people want to do this work we  want to provide action steps #BlerdDating
@chilltowntv I would imagine. There used to be stats around domestic violence and the Super Bowl for the same reason. There is a whole lot of ‘macho’ happening in one night. #Blerddating
@chilltowntv So here’s the thing about that...I posted it bc I have seen several stories about it over the years but I was informed that it actually isn’t substantiated by statistics. I would imagine that a lot of sexual misconduct happens though #BlerdDating
@chilltowntv Eventually that something was starting ‘me too.’ as a means of providing these girls a pathway to healing. It just grew from there. #BlerdDating
@chilltowntv We started off creating an organization called Just Be Inc to work with young Black and Brown girls and those girls had so many experiences with sexual violence that we knew we had to do something #BlerdDating
@chilltowntv Me too was originally founded in response to an issue my friends and I saw tearing our community up - sexual violence. But no one was talking about it #BlerdDating

@AmyKremer @cliff_notes @momsamango @CNN Lady, don't come on this thread talking to my folk crazy. Keep it on television. We don't agree - obviously - just move along.
@ShaniaS2019 @reggie_cat @WendyWilliams I mean I don't know what else to say to you at this point. If you think we are 'picking' on a documented sexual predator who preys on young Black girls - I am literally out of things to say.
Went on @CNN to talk about why I turned down Cong. Speier's invitation to attend the SOTU and the State of OUR Union event that a powerful group of orgs are hosting this Tues 1/30. Was on with Amy Kremer, chair of Women Vote Trump. 'Twas interesting. 	https://t.co/wgYztopgWe
@ShaniaS2019 @reggie_cat @WendyWilliams Ok, sis.
@ShaniaS2019 @ramatoulai @WendyWilliams That's one case. You think ALL of the accusers lied to him? This isn't about just one case - he has dozens and dozens over the years.	Look it up.
@ShaniaS2019 @reggie_cat @WendyWilliams Sis, you can do the research. The article I posted is from a reputable media outlet. It is well researched and documented. We aren't randomly picking on this man. Google it yourself. Look up Jim Deregotis, look up Jerhonda Pace. You can formulate your own opinion.
@LeslieMac @brownblaze Ashe.
@ShaniaS2019 @reggie_cat @WendyWilliams We also know that young girls are impressionable and more vulnerable to manipulation. Who knows what he said to get her in that house.
@ShaniaS2019 @reggie_cat @WendyWilliams She went voluntarily bought by a 17 year old girl apparently- and that’s why Wendy is saying she can’t say #metoo bc she ‘willingly’ had sex with him. But she is ignoring the fact that a minor can’t consent to sex with an adult. It’s rape.
@VirgoJ24 I THREW MY DAMN SHOE AT THE SCREEN LAWD GEEZUS!!!
@ShaniaS2019 @WendyWilliams Sis, check my timeline and please read every word or the article I posted about this and other incidents involving him. My issue with WW is her saying 1. We’re 10 yes too late and 2. His victims can’t say ‘me too.’
@DeeshaDyer This is it, sis. I feel it. ❤️🖤💚
@KordaWards @LegisEmpress @WendyWilliams Exactly! Great point and I bet she would NEVER say that!
@Skurinski @WendyWilliams There is plenty of blame to spread around for not protecting the children. But the focus of the conversation is the PREDATOR and saying the children are complicit bc they chose to sleep with a grown man is WRONG period.
@JamilahLemieux OMG! I didn't even know this was HER! &lt;3
@lindaoverman That quote.
@travledbohemian @WendyWilliams Wow. I don’t watch her show so I had no idea. 😕
@nicksmithnews @WendyWilliams Listen. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I’ll post this yet again for those who are unfamiliar with the life and crimes of Robert ‘R’ Kelly: 		https://t.co/E9nIH11DIz
@askrosej @WendyWilliams Exactly! And it’s those myths and stereotypes that are killing us.
@smille5884 @WendyWilliams @metoo Could be. It wouldn’t surprise me.
@lvrandafighter @WendyWilliams FLOORED!!’ Like, where have you been since the civil rights movement?! Blacks people aren’t good at protest??
I will take my last dying breath fighting against sexual violence and standing for survivors. WE ARE NOT COMPLICIT IN OUR OWN ABUSE!! To anyone who has survivors sexual assault or abuse - please hear that and know that with all your heart. It’s not your fault. 💕
I am going to stop this rant bc I’m hot, fire, burning mad. But sis, @WendyWilliams you are part of the problem in our community. Those folks who clapped in your audience are too. You need an education about sexual violence - STAT.
...but the CHILD in that video just finished EIGHTH GRADE! And you maintain it was her CHOICE to sleep with this adult man? Regardless to what Aaliyah’s folks allowed - R. Kelly still MARRIED an underage girl. Keep the focus on HIM!
You are doing the very same thing that white folks do to our girls which is forget that they are CHILDREN!! 	R. Kelly PREYS ON CHILDREN! Stay right there for a second. You @WendyWilliams said you WATCHED the video and was disgusted but she’s not a #metoo
When I started this work I was working with 7th/8th grade Black girls who were ‘dating’ grown ass men who preyed on them bc they were poor and naive. They were being manipulated into sexual relationships. Do you not remember being 13?! @WendyWilliams
It is disgraceful that as wide as your audience is and as many young girls, many Black girls watch your show that you would openly victim blame like you did yesterday. You are the reason why we can’t make headway in our community around sexual violence. @WendyWilliams
@WendyWilliams I urge you to talk to Jerhonda Pace. Look in her face and tell her it was HER FAULT at 14 for allowing a rich, famous man to lure her into his web. She was a CHILD manipulated by an adult man! #muteRkelly
These are GIRLS! They are children. Why does that have to be explained to you! This man URINATED ON AN 8th GRADER and you have the nerve to say it’s HER FAULT!?! @WendyWilliams Have you ever talked to one of his victims?! #muteRKelly @metoo
@WendyWilliams I tried to hold my tongue, but I can’t. Yes, Wendy said he was sick but pivoted to blaming the parents. FOCUS - HE IS THE PREDATOR - period. How dare you get on National TV and say his victims can’t say #metoo you should be ashamed @WendyWilliams
I heard what Wendy said yesterday and was disgusted by it. This is why Black women/girls are hesitant about coming forward with their #metoo stories bc of Black women like @WendyWilliams who blame the victim. You really think a 13 y.o. girl is to BLAME for sex w/ a 30+ y.o. man?? https://t.co/0mCmAnd0at

@renegademom @Aly_Raisman Not someday - NOW. It’s not solely about women being harassed in the workplace that is a gross misconception. It is about PEOPLE who have survived sexual trauma. It’s not about taking down powerful men or equal pay or any other misconceptions. It’s about us. Survivors.
Woke up with the brave Olympic gymnast and all the girls who testified against LN on my heart. They are the embodiment of the #metoo MOVEMENT. It’s about survivors drawing strength from other survivors.  @Aly_Raisman is a hero and so are all of the others. 💕

Black girls know sexual harassment and abuse all too well. Watch this powerful video that makes it clear. #MeTooK12 #HerToo https://t.co/7cysXpF0M9
The sexual harassment black girls face in schools often takes the form of catcalling, touching, ogling and name calling and echo our specific history of institutionalized rape and dehumanization in the U.S. #MeTooK12 #HerToo https://t.co/pPcssiLVhj
@ssais “National studies show a glaring discrepancy between the small number of schools reporting incidents of sexual harassment and the large number of students saying they experience it,” writes @SSAIS, citing this report. #MeTooK12 https://t.co/JgQNitj0kd
The 'me too.' MVMT started with Black and Brown girls in the south and I know first hand how students face and perpetrate sexual assault and harassment in schools. #MeTooK12 demands that we all pay attention.  Thank you @SSAIS. On #MeTooK12: https://t.co/kyp7k2c9vc

There is very little conversation about queer and trans folks in this moment. No conversation about folks with disabilities. Anywhere you find vulnerable people you will find rampant sexual violence. https://t.co/pafv6QtwkX
There has been little conversation about young people either. Not just college students. HS and MS students who are being sexually harassed and assaulted by fellow students, teachers and paraprofessional. #metoo https://t.co/pafv6QtwkX
So many people and industries are left out. I’m looking at what is happening in Sweden. They have a #metoo hashtag for every industry. We need to expose the harassment and violence folks face everywhere. https://t.co/pafv6QtwkX

@804StreetMedia @AneMenik You can use it however you please brother. I gave you feedback to help you. You framed your original post as if I was simply trying to criticize your efforts when you know full well I was not. But it’s fine. I’m glad it motivated you. Be well.
@AneMenik @804StreetMedia But the bottom line is YOU reached out to me and I took time out to sit and give you feedback so that you can find some success. You are now trying to characterize that in a different way. That’s fine. My conscious is clear. Wish you well, brother.
@AneMenik @804StreetMedia I also told you that asking survivors to come forward and tell their stories from a man who hadn’t been through it and no other survivors attached can be seen as patriarchal - even if we’ll intentioned.
@AneMenik @804StreetMedia You should share the *entire* conversation. I started by telling you that folks reached out to me to validate you bc they questions like I did when you first reached out.
@DominaWillow @804StreetMedia This comment he posted is taking my comments out of context. I honestly don't appreciate it.
@804StreetMedia I have been nothing but supportive since you came asking me to help you. My comments to you were an effort to SUPPORT YOUR WORK. This hashtag is not responsible for what happened today with Russell Simmons. Be clear. It was the courage of a SURVIVOR.
@804StreetMedia That is NOT what I said, brother. This is a gross mischaracterization of what I said. I was trying to give you feedback based on what you ASKED me. I was talking about the fact that you are saying HerRapStory and you don't have any actual stories attached.

A12: Part of what ‘me too.’ is and will continue to be is an entry point. #ConsentCulture https://t.co/jrsRCeE5bS
A12: In my experience once folks know that they control the power to feel different it changes everything. I don’t believe in being completely 'healed' I believe healing is a lifelong journey and the hardest part is starting. #ConsentCulture https://t.co/jrsRCeE5bS
A12: The responses run the gamut from empowered to weary. I don’t even try to define what healing looks like for survivors bc we all need such very different things. Instead I try to help people see that healing is possible and find pathways to it. #ConsentCulture https://t.co/jrsRCeE5bS
A11: I constantly advise folks to log off. Don’t feel an obligation to engage in this moment, be gentle with yourself and don’t feel an ounce of shame for it. #ConsentCulture https://t.co/VCU1sNMBUE
A11: We are living through unprecedented times. As beautiful as this global movement is to watch unfold, I am also alarmed when I think of the numbers of survivors forced to engage with stories of sexual violence daily for over a month straight. #ConsentCulture https://t.co/VCU1sNMBUE
A10: Organizations need to find ways to provide resources to support the work that is already happening in the communities they serve. #ConsentCulture https://t.co/FE5Fs5rkYb
A10: I believe empathy is a pathway to healing. There has always been peer to peer support. The Me Too Movement is an example of that and there are so many others across the country. This is one of the ways institutions can amplify the strengths in a community. #ConsentCulture https://t.co/FE5Fs5rkYb
A9: Ultimately the laws determine punishment but we each have to define what justice looks like for us. #ConsentCulture https://t.co/kPAC7AcwH8
A9: Ideas like restorative or transformative justice are being introduced more widely. #ConsentCulture https://t.co/kPAC7AcwH8
A9: That’s not for me to answer. In many ways justice is a personal decision for each survivor. I will say that bc of our history with the justice system many SOC are thinking out of the box. #ConsentCulture https://t.co/kPAC7AcwH8
A8: We can’t shift the culture without reshaping the way young people think about consent and boundaries. #ConsentCulture https://t.co/iAATvKui1W
A8: We had PSAs and school programs and advertisements that all reinforced the same message. #ConsentCulture https://t.co/iAATvKui1W
A8: It should be always listed as a strategy for interrupting sexual violence. We need to elevate the consent conversation in the same way the anti-drug use was done in the 80s and 90s. #ConsentCulture https://t.co/iAATvKui1W
A7: Cultural competency is not just hiring POC its being intentional about understanding the communities you serve, embracing and amplifying the healing that is already present and bringing resources to the most underserved people. It takes courage and resilience #ConsentCulture https://t.co/yFVUQ3tRJu
@DCRapeCrisis A7: 3) bring the resources you do have TO the community. Outreach programs that happen in the same places or at times when working class folks can’t attend or that aren’t promoted in places where POC frequent aren’t effective. #ConsentCulture
A7: 2) expand understanding of what healing or support look like – and again trust that folks know what they need even if its contrary to your understanding, and #ConsentCulture https://t.co/yFVUQ3tRJu
A7: Communities of color are crippled by well warranted distrust of systems – even ones that are in place to serve some of our needs. That’s why advocates we have to - 1) trust that survivors of color often know what they need but lack the resources, #ConsentCulture https://t.co/yFVUQ3tRJu
A6: Knowing the potential triggers it’s also important to get outside support. #ConsentCulture https://t.co/Rs3Kq8YKET
A6: My daughter and I are both survivors and as hard as it was, I had to resist the urge to try and fix her as opposed to listening to her needs. It’s important to be honest with our children and ourselves. #ConsentCulture https://t.co/Rs3Kq8YKET
A5: They also need to understand that intersectionality is not a gift. It’s earned. One of the ways is through accountability. It’s not about shaming folks or dredging up the past it’s about truth and reconciliation. No more or less than what other folks want. #ConsentCulture https://t.co/IrFAy8Xcn8
A5: Intentionality and strategy. We get a lot of ‘commitment’ to racial justice but not a lot of action. White advocates have to go to the next step and strategize about how to actionize that commitment. #ConsentCulture https://t.co/IrFAy8Xcn8
A4: Schools are hypervigilant about their behavior and fail to identify what could be indicators of trauma. #ConsentCulture https://t.co/PIJP8amuSw
A4: It’s used to characterize a phenomenon where scores of girls of color are pushed out of school and into the prison industry. It’s the result of GOC being seen as automatically problematic. #ConsentCulture https://t.co/PIJP8amuSw
A3: WOC have been largely left out of this conversation. Many don’t feel like it’s about us. In order to elevate voices of #WOC – white woman have to be intentional about how they engage and when necessary take a step back or create space where WOC are centered. #ConsentCulture https://t.co/H4ICMjJS9S

In the meantime...one way or another I hope Dick Wolf @wolffilms and the whole cast of @nbcsvu knows how much me and thousands of other survivors appreciate them!! #THANKUSVU
I’m secretly hoping for a #metoo episode of @nbcsvu 😬 (yes, I’m shameless) but I would be outdone!! 	#ThankUSVU
I love all of the cast (and I’ve even forgiven @CNconnienielsen for that one season 😑) but I have a special place in my heart for @Mariska 💕💕 and I’m so grateful for the work she’s done in and off screen. #THANKUSVU
And then @Mariska started @TheJHF Joyful Heart and I couldn’t believe it!! I wondered how all of those stories effected her and the cast. She didn’t just do a PSA or write a check she got proactive! #THANKUSVU
There is something comforting and affirming about watching sexual predators get caught &amp; survivors get some form of justice. And that’s not to say they haven’t made missteps or mucked up some issues. But overall, they are so good! #THANKUSVU
I have always wondered if other survivors felt like I did. I mean, I know the show has all kinds of fans, but it has to hold a special place in the heart of survivors of sexual violence. #THANKUSVU
Clearly I was DEVASTATED, like any true @nbcsvu fan, when #ChristipherMeloni left. I thought I couldn’t keep watching. But alas, my love for @Mariska Hargitay knows no bounds. #THANKUSVU
I watched the first few episodes and I was hooked. Benson and Stabler played so well off of each other and then Munch was perfectly awkward. I loved them. I was sad that @MichelleHurd7 (Det. Jeffries) only had one season but @icetsvu Fin was so good!
@nbcsvu As a lover of the original @lawandorder I was intrigued but as a survivor of sexual violence I just imagined being triggered week after week watching sad and horrifying stories unfold that were like any one of my own. #THANKUSVU
This meme has inspired me to write a tribute to @nbcsvu - my absolute, all time favorite television show. 	I remember when it debuted (yes, I’m that old) and I was leery about a whole show dedicated to sex crimes. Really, I was kinda horrified. #THANKUSVU https://t.co/ZZSzsHQ2Oy

@Karnythia @Karnythia Thank you for this 💕
@TuffyMichelle @Karnythia @rhymeswithvery @chinacatrider The power in having a global community of survivors who are unified in their determination not to have their trauma define or undermine them is remarkable, but we still have to contend with how power and privilege operate within that community. #metooMVMT
@TuffyMichelle @Karnythia @rhymeswithvery @chinacatrider I've said repeatedly that this work and movement has to center Black and Brown folks and those most marginalized bc if not they will be pushed to the fringes and further marginalized. Case in point Lupita and Aurora.
@TuffyMichelle @Karnythia @rhymeswithvery @chinacatrider 'me too.' was founded because the only way to get resources where I lived was to report your sexual assault to the police. It was founded bc the Black &amp; Brown girls didn't have support or information and we aimed to fill that void.
@TuffyMichelle @rhymeswithvery @chinacatrider @Karnythia Once we started we found out quickly how powerful the words - and our philosophy of 'empowerment through empathy' were and have always been about the work of supporting all survivors. However, I'm clear that our communities needs are often the last to be met.
@TuffyMichelle @Karnythia @rhymeswithvery @chinacatrider I am the founder and I started 'me too.' not to exclude anyone but rather because the women and girls I served were not *included*. The services in the community I was in were limited and those offered weren't culturally competent. It was out of necessity.

@RepSpeier @SenGillibrand @JacksonLeeTX18 So in summary. Congrats to these lawmakers on their swift action to protect their own. I only hope we have equally swift action for some policies that will benefit the people whom they serve, many of who are survivors of sexual violence. Fin.
@RepSpeier @SenGillibrand 4. I spoke today at the invitation of @JacksonLeeTX18 (Rep. Shelia Jackson Lee) about work to end violence against women and girls across the country and the world - it had nothing to do with this announcement. (See point 1)
@RepSpeier @SenGillibrand 3. I think it's wonderful that these two lawmakers were swift to take action to protect the folks that work on Capitol Hill but be clear this is NOT a bill about supporting survivors of Sexual Violence.
@RepSpeier @SenGillibrand 1. I had nothing to do with the bill. No one contacted me and I had no input in it whatsoever. 	2. The bill is NOT for survivors of sexual violence. It is to ensure that folks who work on Capitol Hill have sexual harassment training. #metooBill

@PunishmentHurts @Jewell40289493 @TDeLynne I am talking about the empathy shared between survivors. The thread is about that.
@PunishmentHurts @Jewell40289493 @TDeLynne I appreciate the apology, but in the context of what I was talking about in that thread I meant *empathy*. Read the entire thread.
@TammyRyanSpBT I have a friend who writes about this! @Afrodoula
@PunishmentHurts @TDeLynne I know the difference. I said what I said. 🙂
There is enough empathy and healing for everyone. I promise. #metoo 💕💕
My point is there is too much trauma and suffering in the world for us to try and take things away from folk that help heal them. #metoo
I hope your answer is you would give it away and encourage folks to plant in their own yards and grow more! #metoo
Think of it this way. If a tree grew in your yard &amp; the fruit of that tree had a balm to heal wounds. Would you hoard it or share it? #metoo
Who are we to take that from them. Who are we to put a limit on someone’s healing? @metoo
If a queer or trans person or a cis man who is a survivor finds refuge in these words and in the community being built from these words..
Nobody owns #metoo. Not me. Not you. Not @Alyssa_Milano nor should we want to.
Survivors who have found healing, or community, or empowerment in these two words should revel in that fact. #metoo
But since #metoo became popularized it has become a tool for healing across the spectrum of survivors around the world. And I’m glad.
My work has always been and will always be committed to the most marginalized: POC, queer folk, differently abled, etc... #metoo
Yes, it is absolutely true that I started this work to support young women of color and later adult women of color #metoo
A lot of folks have questions but the question I get the most is “who is me too for?” #metoo
I have talked to survivors from around the world and all walks of life in the last 4 days and there is so much generosity of spirit #metoo
I have had an overwhelmingly great response from folks in regard to the #metoomvmnt so far and it has been a blessing to experience #metoo
So, I haven’t said much this time week because this movement speaks for itself in a lot of ways. But I need to say something tonight. #metoo

It’s beyond a hashtag. It’s the start of a larger conversation and a movement for radical community healing. Join us. 	#metoo
particularly young women of color know that they are not alone - it’s a movement. 	#metoo
The point of the work we’ve done over the last decade with the ‘me too movement’ is to let women, 	#metoo
to not only show the world how widespread and pervasive sexual violence is, but also to let other survivors know they are not alone.	#metoo
It made my heart swell to see women using this idea - one that we call ‘empowerment through empathy’ #metoo
....in particular, today I have watched women on social media disclose their stories using the hashtag #metoo.

@carolynedgar Yup. I know. But he's still bordering on pathetic to me. My issue isn't just with him though. The whole thing was a sham.
@carolynedgar Yeah, it was. You should read @jelani9 assessment of it in the NYer. Let me find the link.
@carolynedgar Who would do that today?
@carolynedgar Right! I think that's the point I'm making. He was moving to a place that wasn't largely accepted, but he moved there anyway.
@carolynedgar There was a ton of activity in the streets that I think would qualify as movement work, but not a ton from the podium.
@carolynedgar advantage in advancing an overall agenda. I don't see many leaders or politicians or "activist" doing the same.

@carolynedgar there is nothing radical about Barack Obama. And other "activist" and "leaders" in our community are so PC they won't go to
@carolynedgar ...based on the person he was in '63 and especially who he evolved to in '68 that statement rings true on its own.
@carolynedgar I try never to romanticize King, bc I think his persona overshadow contributions of the entire movement, however I do think...
@carolynedgar Now, I definitely agree with that! Look at Mobile Mayoral race. SMH.
@carolynedgar I think that imagery drives the point home of just how *much* both sides, particularly the left, have let the legacy down.
@carolynedgar I don't think if King was still living he would be disinvited, but I do think MLK of '63 would not be welcomed with open arms.
@DrCamikaRoyal sidenote. Are you able to get on Facebook? I haven't been able for the last hour.
@jelani9 I thought your critique was dead on. Thank you!

@DrCamikaRoyal @imaniperry It's exactly why. This whitewash is horrid. MLK would have no place to present his platform in this charade.

@JadoreJustine When you come we have to work out. I'll juice for you for a few days and you'll see what a difference it makes for you.
@JadoreJustine Me and Kaia have to come visit then. She's dying to visit England!

@JadoreJustine Yeah, she has a company called Onion. Google Whitney Mero. I hosted a few trunk shows for her. She makes gorgeous dresses.

I'm 38-32-44. Trying to get this first two numbers down an the last up, lol. I need hips! I'm getting closer and closer.
Anowais  36-28-45 and fit as hell. I don't know @serenawilliams bc you can't get accurate info online but it has to be close. Similar build.
She has officially joined @serenawilliams as my body idols. They are both 3-4 inches taller than me but our measurements are similar.
She is so dope!! Her body is sickening like @serenawilliams she's 5'10/200lbs and she trains women to be "fit and curvy" and love themselves
Oh! Speaking of @serenawilliams has anybody ever heard of "The Nigerian Powerhouse" Anowa? She's a fitness coach and trainer.
Wow! @serenawilliams' profile picture is Gorg! Geez.

BCBG takes clothes from Mandee's, steams them and puts them under spotlights and then charges.

I mean they got why too short was wrong and why we must push to #fireVanessSatten but it really #itsbiggerthan2short is an understatement
This work is getting harder and harder ya'll. #itsbiggerthan2short
dang. I keep forgetting the hashtag.
She was so serious. She went on to tell me how her friends are jealous and just want to make him look bad but he doesn't mean it.

She said, "you know how she had everyone believing he was all bad even AFTER he apologized." She tried to make him look bad.

Hold your mules. She actually SAID, I'm not going to be like Rihanna. To which I replied, what does that mean? #itsbiggerthan2short
I had to take her to the side to talk to her personally and she tried to explain to me that he doesn't mean it. #itsbiggerthan2short
He smacks her on the butt when he sees her in the hall, but also invites his friends to do it too. #itsbiggerthan2short
also made me crazy to hear them make excuses for these boys! had a 7th grdr whose "boyfriend" basically loans her out. #itsbiggerthan2short
It made my heart heavy to hear 12/13 yr old girls who have already given in to the idea that men will always treat them like objects.
They talked about the various ways in which they protect themselves to get through the day. Including violence. #itsbiggerthan2short
The trip is how most of them were dismissive like "thats just how boys are Ms. Tarana" itsbiggerthan2short
Then when I asked how many of you have had a boy try and smack you on the butt or touch your breast. All hands raised. #itsbiggerthan2short
@fiyawata try it now. I think I took it off, even though I see the little lock.
@fiyawata Oh! Sorry, let me take that off.
The other thing they scream out to the girls as they pass? "Girl I wanna see you strip!" a Chris Brown joint. #itsbiggerthan2short
The boys have taken to chanting "ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass ,ass..." as the girls walk down the hall. #itsbiggerthan2short
they got quiet then. nobody wanted to read. I asked them have boys ever shouted any of these lyrics at them - Yes. #itsbiggerthan2short
I then distributed lyrics from songs by each of those artists and asked them to read them aloud. Uncut versions. #itsbiggerthan2short
I said okay, well what about Tyga, Chris Brown, J. Cole, Lil Wayne and Big Sean? You all like them right ad they agreed. #itbiggerthan2short
They also said that they didn't know too short and why he was talking to their age group anyway #itsbiggerthan2short
They said they felt disgusted and angry and violated and things of that nature...but that was how all boys were so they understood.
I explained to my group of 7th and 8th grade girls what happend in this Too Short situation and asked how they felt. #itsbiggerthan2short
today was one of the hardest days I have had since we started doing work with girls in Philly. #itsbiggerthan2short
@fiyawata I'm HERE! Just got in. So now what do I do...
@fiyawata I'll let you know how it goes.
@fiyawata I gotcha. I'll put on my smartyart hat. :) In other news, I'm discussing this with my middle school girls group today. So nervous.

@BasseyworldLive Take that BACK! Take it back RIGHT NOW!
So this is more tweeting than i've done in months! I'm beat! Happy New Year's to all and to all a Good Night!! #2011
That includes more blogging (and shameless plugs, look out for that) and working on Just Be Inc. (www.justbeinc.org)
The biggest change for me this year will be getting back to the things i love AND that will carry me forward in my walk.
My bestest friend, or rather my sister @Naturaleflower is everything. #thatisall
I know i've missed some folk. If you know me at all you know it isn't on purpose, but im tired so i need to get to my last shout out.
@Nothinbuttreble i need to send you a shout, bc you love the Lord and you love to Laugh! And know it's NOT a contradiction! #praiseHim ;)
Who have i forgotten? Ya'll know i dont be on these internets...let me check my list...keep partying, i'll be right back.
Bigger shout to the funniest negros on my twitters:@femme_menace, @NzingaJenkins, @feminista09, @writeli, @helena_andrews, @msnyreeemory

@famouschamous you'll probably read this tweet NEXT new years o_O, but i'm so grateful that you're an insomniac AND the queen of snark ;)
@carolynedgar is kind of a kindred spirit, so glad that we got to hang out so much this year, you my homie for real :)
Likewise @imaniperry is one of the most serene and calming spirits i've ever met, spent more time w/ you this year and im the better for it.
@BasseyworldLive always gives me shoutouts for being a good friend but honey she carried a LOT of weight for me this year & im so grateful.
Like i said, the phrase, "I get by with a lil help from my friends" has NEVER been truer than 2010. This has been a year of great connection
I'm not sad at all, just makes me more introspective. What a year. 12 months ago i envisioned this night being so different than it is now.
To top it off, this Black bride from the BRONX is actually wearing my dress! Or what would have been my dress...has to mean something.
I'm sitting here watching the first wedding show that I've been able to watch since canceling my wedding almost a year ago. #cathartictweet

In case you were wondering where my commode went...it's downstairs, next to the stove:  http://twitpic.com/3113pi
I need this house and go to my office. There is no peace here. And also no toilet. http://twitpic.com/3112nm

It's one thing to have construction workers in your house as early as 7AM, it's a whole other story to listen to them rant about their wives

Oh, what a WORD I received today. #blessGod #EnonTab
@blackgirlproj I love the work you're doing! Check out our site: www.justbeinc.org
@blackgirlproj Ha! You know I read your tweet wrong! But totally agree. We should talk about collaboration. I run a girl's org.

@flygirlblog Yeah, she was hit or miss to me. There were a few good, but mostly bad. I agree about Mike C.
@flygirlblog Yup. She's tragic and really shouldn't have made it that far. Mike C's stuff was GORG!!
Ditto. RT @flygirlblog i felt really bad for Michael C on Project Runway and Gretchen's mini-collection looked very vintage-Etsy-shop-like
Yeah. That. RT @BasseyworldLive um...if by corrupted you mean made more awesome.
@BasseyworldLive has forever corrupted my kid. She won't wear this hat bc it doesn't "fit just like Ms. Bassey's!!" #ibetyouwill

@shesocalilily It aired on Wed I think. It was about his physical and sexual abuse as a child. Very, moving. He talked briefly about FCG.
@msnyreeemory Order the breakfast Anna May. Your adventures in babeland are making me sick, FYI. #westcoastenvytweet
@shesocalilily Either way. We'll find out in two weeks. O_O (the promotion doesn't seem as heavy as other movies though - is that just me?)
@shesocalilily I'm glad he got rid of the worst of the worst actresses like Mariah and Alicia K. Maybe the actresses strenghts will help.
@shesocalilily In my opinion it's the equivalent of adding the "white saviour" to black movies. He doesn't get it. I wouldn't expect him to.
@shesocalilily I think he was the wrong person to do it for so many reasons and that "good black man" comment is one.
@shesocalilily You are absolutely right. It was clear from Oprah that he didn't know what he was getting into when he took it on.

@imaniperry Maybe, but that's a bad reason, bc awful is an UNDERSTATEMENT. In other news though I'll see you tomorrow right?
@amaditalks Oh I missed this tweet. Mike C is out and Gretchen is in. Unreal.
@BasseyworldLive see you gonna make me DM you. *sigh* here we go.
@BasseyworldLive If you always do what you've always done, you always get what you've always got. #grandmamatweet #calmyoazzdown
@amaditalks Do you REALLY want to know??
I don't even WANT to see the final show! #thisissomebullshitgeraldo
WHAT??? What JUST HAPPENED!!!
NO WAY!!!!!!!!!!!
@amaditalks Well I won't spoil it for you...but she is a trainwreck #asusual
You know you do ;) RT @BasseyworldLive: I think I come up to Philly every other day just to hang out with @Taranorama.
RT @NzingaJenkins: Adulthood is not for the faint of heart. (you ain't never lie homie)
Gretchen looks like she designs for Speigel clearance. #projectrunway
Why doesn't Gretchen evoke sympathy from me? I still can't with her #projectrunway
I always love this part of Project Runway when they visit the kids and you find these open, supportive, honest families. #pride #PR
Mondo!
So...your parents knew nothing Mike C? #denial
Oh Michael is coming for you heauxs!!! Do you see these pieces?? #projectrunway
@MartiniPink So I step out during a boring ass mtg pretending to make a call & read this now I can't stop laughing. Thanks! #cantgobackinyet

Philly is working my nerves today.
The devil is busy.
I mean he also works in the pizza shop, which is cool, he's very attractive...w/ his mouth closed.
Should I feel guilty that every time I see this man in the mall and he flirts w/me I think "if you only had teeth brother, I'd date you."
@theferocity Yes Lawd! That part and then the "...come back...come back baby" takes me through each and every time.
@TONISMALLS Hey did you get my email? Sent it Monday I think.
@Lumumbabandele Scream that from the rooftops! Change in regime in AL brought down all of our institutions :(
