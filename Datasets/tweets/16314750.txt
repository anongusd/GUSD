@JMolinaFlynnEsq @JonPincince It's online only on the front-end and good luck finding out how to fill it out on paper.  That will be one of the many, many challenges.
well-positioned to succeed.  But, significant challenges remain (like winning the lawsuit against the addition of the Citizenship question) &amp; dealing with the lack of funding.  And, oh yeah, this is the 1st Census to completely rely on online submissions (w/ untested technology)
Co-chaired by Mayor @JamesDiossa &amp; @RIHEALTH's Dr. Nicole Alexander Scott &amp; catalyzed by Sen. @SANDRISCANO &amp; @JohnMarionjr &amp; staffed by Statewide Planning &amp; consultant Chris Harley, with generous support from @JDinRI &amp; the @RIFoundation, the Complete Count cmte is https://t.co/UIvbzEKJ61
issued an executive order creating a RI Complete Count Committee. More than 60 people met tonight at its first meeting. This group - no doubt - has the talent and the strategy to fill in all of the holes (negligently or intentionally) put in the Census by the Trump Administration
BILLIONS of dollars that we are rightfully owed, local taxpayers have to make up the difference and the political power of the state and the nation flows to the suburbs and rural areas and away from cities.  For this and many other reasons, I am thrilled that @GovRaimondo
But now, we have a Census that is under-funded, under-tested, behind-schedule and seeking to use a Steve Bannon inspired question that might scare immigrants from not responding to the Census.  What could this mean?  Cities all across Rhode Island are under-counted and we lose
Even during the best of times (say 2010, under President @BarackObama), properly counting every Rhode Islander is a difficult task (students, renters, immigrants, children, seniors).  And $3 BILLION a year in federal funding is at stake for RI schools, health care &amp; housing

@jefflevy @darlene_allen @HoldSher Yes, there are many outlets for you to release your corporate lawyer guilt for the bad things you have been privy to. Actions speak louder than tweets.
@jefflevy @RISpeaker Well you were top legal dog when your company met with Providence. How did that meeting get arranged?  And do you still support privatization of PVD‚Äôs water supply?
@jefflevy @darlene_allen @HoldSher Sued Jeff Sessions last week. Sued president Trump the month before that. Helped write DACA for RI b4 that. Last 10 years fought with the ACLU and progressive trial lawyers for real changes to the judicial system. I was never the corporate lawyer defending privatization like you?

Our job is to interpret the law Congress has enacted and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. PASPA is not. PASPA ‚Äúregulate[s] state governments‚Äô regulation‚Äù of their citizens... The Constitution gives Congress no such power.
The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make. Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each State is free to act on its own.
States may now legalize sports betting as the US Supreme Courts holds that the federal prohibition on state laws re: sports betting violates the anti-commandeering rule https://t.co/XRbe4vdvpg

@MarkJGray @jefflevy @SamuelWBell @JakeBissaillon @RIProgDems @RISpeaker @NickMattielloRI @tanzister @katecoynemccoy @RICAGV1 Last-minute Senate move would have caused chaos late into the night.  House committed to that stuff not happening this year.
@jefflevy @JakeBissaillon @RIProgDems @SamuelWBell @RISpeaker @NickMattielloRI @tanzister @katecoynemccoy @RICAGV1 "Sell to a friend" was an NRA requested change. Ultimately everyone agreed to get across finish line, but it's the truth.
@SamuelWBell @jefflevy @JakeBissaillon @RIProgDems @RISpeaker @NickMattielloRI @tanzister @katecoynemccoy @RICAGV1 Senate made unprecedented, last-minute move for unknown reason. House had passed, was ready to pass, great bills.
@SamuelWBell @jefflevy @JakeBissaillon @RIProgDems @RISpeaker @NickMattielloRI @tanzister @katecoynemccoy @RICAGV1 That is spin. My points are facts.
@jefflevy @JakeBissaillon @RIProgDems @SamuelWBell @RISpeaker @NickMattielloRI @tanzister @katecoynemccoy @RICAGV1 Yes, Jeff, House bill was stronger. If Senate had passed House version, it would be on Governors desk now.
@jefflevy @JakeBissaillon @RIProgDems @SamuelWBell @RISpeaker @NickMattielloRI Advocates specifically rejected the "sale to a friend" provision in the House -	 right @tanzister &amp; @katecoynemccoy ?

@phileil @Geoff_Ayoub We all know the difference b/w an Op-ed and 100 phone calls.  Nice tweeting.  Look forward to that beer.  Bye.
@cluxmoore @phileil I appreciate your input. Hopefully, you will dig beneath biased coverage &amp; see striking reforms made in just 2.5 years.
@phileil @Geoff_Ayoub That's not the definition of public pressure. Bottom line is that THIS Speaker gets reforms done. Every year.
@cluxmoore @phileil I believe your statements don't reflect the 2.5 years of this Speaker &amp; his record of reform. Agree to disagree.
@phileil @Geoff_Ayoub Relatively speaking, there was less public interest / pressure on lobby reform in hearings, etc.. than other bills.Yes
@Geoff_Ayoub @phileil There was pressure for campaign finance reforms? lobby reforms?  No, not accurate. Was done bc it was right thing 2 do
@cluxmoore @phileil That's a very inaccurate and unfair statement.  If "no choice," then why didnt these reforms get done by other people?
@phileil And this session started with its passage. But okay. After session, lets debrief over a üç∫!
@phileil finance reform, ethics reform, lobbying reform &amp; community service grants reform. Will that story of reform be told by the media?
@phileil My point is that after this session, it is likely that Speaker will have done - in 2.5 sessions - master lever reform, campaign
@phileil No, ethics bill hasnt passed. yet. still getting feedback and comments as part of our public hearing/vetting process
@phileil Reforms in last 2+ years have been real &amp; historic. Steady progress will never satisfy some. But honest analysis needs that context
@phileil Surprising comments from a former Phoenix editor! Fwiw, BIG reforms in last 2.5 years under this Speaker #MasterLever #Ethics etc
