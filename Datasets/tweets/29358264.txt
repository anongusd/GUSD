Health and Human Services Levy: County services cover a LOT that Medicaid doesn't, esp for addictions. http://t.co/hPhYxCaqwZ. #Levynight
Help support the port! Follow @ourport2013. #Levynight
Metroparks Levy will be for 10 years. Metroparks are operated debt free. #Levynight
Port generates $1.6 billion in Cleveland area economic area. #Levynight
Port Levy is NOT a tax increase. Issue 82. http://t.co/LGRHx9ArAf

By end of 5 years all Cleveland library branches will have homework help centers. Currently only some do. #Levynight
Cleveland Public Library Levy is a renewal, not a tax increase. CPL in top five libraries nationally in 5 of last 7 years. #Levynight
Metroparks Levy is vital to keep the level of excellence. Have lost state funds due to cuts over several years. Issue 80. #Levynight
Heroin addiction is now an epidemic in our county. Public services vital. Vote for issue 1 for health and human services. #Levynight
Issue 1 important for mental health care. Medicare only covers 7 conditions. County services cover the others.  #Levynight
Correction. The Port Levy is Issue 82. 80 is for Metroparks. #Levynight
