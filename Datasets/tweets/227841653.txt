-30- 		Can you imagine a more perfect way to spend the day before the midterms?
Out of the rack and ruin of our gangster death,	The rape and rot of graft, and stealth, and lies,	We, the people, must redeem	The land, the mines, the plants, the rivers.	The mountains and the endless plain‚Äî	All, all the stretch of these great green states‚Äî	And make America again
Sure, call me any ugly name you choose‚Äî	The steel of freedom does not stain.	From those who live like leeches on the people‚Äôs lives,	We must take back our land again,	America!		O, yes,	I say it plain,	America never was America to me,	And yet I swear this oath‚Äî	America will be!
The land that‚Äôs mine‚Äîthe poor man‚Äôs, Indian‚Äôs, Negro‚Äôs, ME‚Äî	Who made America,	Whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain,	Whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain,	Must bring back our mighty dream again.
O, let America be America again‚Äî	The land that never has been yet‚Äî	And yet must be‚Äîthe land where every man is free.
For all the dreams we‚Äôve dreamed	And all the songs we‚Äôve sung	And all the hopes we‚Äôve held	And all the flags we‚Äôve hung,	The millions who have nothing for our pay‚Äî	Except the dream that‚Äôs almost dead today.
Who said the free?  Not me?	Surely not me?  The millions on relief today?	The millions shot down when we strike?	The millions who have nothing for our pay?
O, I‚Äôm the man who sailed those early seas	In search of what I meant to be my home‚Äî	For I‚Äôm the one who left dark Ireland‚Äôs shore,	And Poland‚Äôs plain, and England‚Äôs grassy lea,	And torn from Black Africa‚Äôs strand I came	To build a ‚Äúhomeland of the free.‚Äù		The free?
Yet I‚Äôm the one who dreamt our basic dream	In the Old World while still a serf of kings,	Who dreamt a dream so strong, so brave, so true,	That even yet its mighty daring sings	In every brick and stone, in every furrow turned	That‚Äôs made America the land it has become.
I am the man who never got ahead,	The poorest worker bartered through the years.
I am the farmer, bondsman to the soil.	I am the worker sold to the machine.	I am the Negro, servant to you all.	I am the people, humble, hungry, mean‚Äî	Hungry yet today despite the dream.	Beaten yet today‚ÄîO, Pioneers!
I am the young man, full of strength and hope,	Tangled in that ancient endless chain	Of profit, power, gain, of grab the land!	Of grab the gold! Of grab the ways of satisfying need!	Of work the men! Of take the pay!	Of owning everything for one‚Äôs own greed!
I am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart,	I am the Negro bearing slavery‚Äôs scars.	I am the red man driven from the land,	I am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek‚Äî	And finding only the same old stupid plan	Of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak.
Say, who are you that mumbles in the dark? 	And who are you that draws your veil across the stars?
O, let my land be a land where Liberty	Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath,	But opportunity is real, and life is free,	Equality is in the air we breathe.		(There‚Äôs never been equality for me,	Nor freedom in this ‚Äúhomeland of the free.‚Äù)
Let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed‚Äî	Let it be that great strong land of love	Where never kings connive nor tyrants scheme	That any man be crushed by one above.		(It never was America to me.)
Let America be America again.	Let it be the dream it used to be.	Let it be the pioneer on the plain	Seeking a home where he himself is free.		(America never was America to me.)

Even if we end this today, we've done so much damage to these children, their families and our standing in the world that it takes my breath away. /7
What we're doing as a nation is barbaric and criminal, but it's impacts will be felt for decades into the future (mental and physical health of these children and parents, their emotional and psychological development, etc) /6
Managing my PTSD etc is part of my life. It always has been. Children's development is specific--to pull them away from parents and family is destabilizing enough that it can and will shake their development. /5
Our journey was harrowing, but we all survived. Still is was traumatic for each of us if different ways. In the years since our escape, I've been diagnosed with PTSD, depression, and anxiety, signs of which showed with in a few months of our arrival in the states /4
I believe this made us bad/villainous people. We were running for our lives. Regardless, we were detained near the border, but we stayed together. My cousin was 5 months, I was almost 3 /3
As I've written about my family escaped from Iran in a rather dramatic fashion. Because it was an escape and we were smuggled, it is fair to say we illegally entered Turkey in 1982 /2

Namazi listened to so many people and supported innovation in civil society in Iran. He was constantly the most energetic and idealistic person in the room. Focused on creating connections between Iran and the West.
