Let’s make [MI, WI, OH] allies in protecting the aquatic gems we have inherited.” We’re watching closely as new Governors take the helm in many Great Lakes states. #stopasiancarp #greatlakes https://t.co/vHsThmwEum

Does anyone give charitable donations as a holiday present? Donations to protect the #GreatLakes make a great gift. Just sayin’! https://t.co/7u2XI7jlG3 https://t.co/ezOJhDMRh2
You can help! The @USACEHQ need to hear from you. They released a final plan to stop Asian carp, &amp; are currently taking public comment. Tell the Corps to act fast to stop #Asiancarp &amp; protect the Great Lakes!		https://t.co/4SPerQmuQa
So - tying this back to the #carpcowboys: fishing #AsianCarp out of the Des Plaines River in Illinois is a necessary but not sufficient to stop the advance of these invasive fish. Structural measures, as proposed by the @USACEHQ for  Brandon Road Lock &amp; Dam are also needed.
Big thanks to Govs-elect @JBPritzker @gretchenwhitmer @MikeDeWine for coming together &amp; sharing the urgent concerns #GreatLakes residents have about #asiancarp with the President.
And yesterday Govs-elect @JBPritzker @gretchenwhitmer @MikeDeWine met with Pres Trump in DC. #Asiancarp was a key part of the discussion: https://t.co/cwk0C37qdz
Earlier this week, MI Gov Snyder @onetoughnerd called on @GovRauner to rethink his position. Snyder has joined w/ other #GreatLakes Govs, putting up $ for the Asian carp project @ Brandon Road Lock &amp; Dam, a key choke point in the rivers leading to Chicago https://t.co/en88CYVs50
On the flip side, our Policy VP notes: "Gov.-elect Pritzker and his administration will have a chance to establish Illinois as a leader in efforts to block Asian carp. He can really take Illinois from obstacle to champion.”
Our Policy VP notes @GovRauner's lack of action on the issue: They've "largely been an obstacle to progress at Brandon Road, downplaying the risks of Asian carp getting into the Great Lakes and questioning the need for additional protection beyond nonstructural measures”
ICYMI last week's story from @_TonyBriscoe @chicagotribune on the fight against #AsianCarp in #Illinois, you should read it. It's a great look at what is - and is not - being done to keep these invasive fish out of the #GreatLakes		https://t.co/kDkwTeh5VS

Removing protections for small waterways hurts all waters says @JoelBrammeier "Keeping those small streams and wetlands healthy and clean is an excellent way to keep water clean generally in the Great Lakes. This is going to make it harder to protect water in the Midwest states.”
We are very concerned about the Trump Administration’s #CleanWaterRule. The government needs to step up its efforts to protect our #drinkingwater, not scale back the rules for polluters. Read more from the @Suntimes Editorial Board &amp; @joelbrammeier https://t.co/Lz0N0hqcGo
Action Alert! Tell the @USACEHQ to stop #Asiancarp. The U.S. Army Corps put out a final draft plan to add more protections downriver from Chicago and #LakeMichigan. The new plan is critical to hold back these invasive fish. But they need to move quickly!	https://t.co/4SPerQmuQa
Did you know that part of #LakeMichigan’s #GreenBay is so low in oxygen, it can’t support life. The cause? Algae fueled by #runoff #pollution.

Thanks for tuning in to our #plasticfree webinar! Want to get active? Check out our toolkit! https://t.co/6NG7SaH7bx #greatlakes #plasticpollution
Q: What can I do as "just" a student?		A: There's lots you can do! Writing a letter to the editor, use social media to engage your community, or meet with your local, state or federal official to share your story. Your voice matters no matter where you share it.
Q: Is there a need for more education on this issue?		A: This is a personal issue that resonates with many. It is critically important to provide science-based information that is easily understood and gives the public tools to take action and make an impact.
Q: What's being done to address microplastics?		A: There are many kinds of microplastics and all require different approaches. Products with microbeads require one solution, while microfiber solutions vary. We can and should encourage business to come up with innovative solutions
Q: Where can I find more data on this issue?		A: There is a lot of data out there done by universities, but we should also be thinking about working with partners in government and elsewhere to standardize our data collection and analysis practices to help us respond accordingly.
Q: Why not just use paper or compostable straws instead of plastic?		A: Needs of the disability vary widely. Some materials may work for some but not all. Any kind of reusable straw can be difficult for someone with issues with dexterity, for example.
Time for our Q&amp;A! What's on your mind about #plasticpollution?
Our #plasticfree toolkit provides examples for how to enact policy change in your community https://t.co/6NG7SaH7bx

In case you don’t have it check out Peter Annin’s book: https://t.co/vOQULKAwdt
Annin notes that #Wisconsin let the Pleasant Prairie diversion increase w/out much discussion/input fr other #GreatLakes states. More to come in this issue... Lots of questions.
Here’s @scribeguy’s story: https://t.co/5x5NyguH62
As @scribeguy notes: Annin uncovered a #bombshell in Pleasant Prairie’s under the radar diversion. What’s the deal?
Compact clauses re communities &amp; counties that straddle the #greatlakes basin (Waukesha) were a compromise to get the Compact enacted. This allowed the #Waukesha proposal to move forward, ultimately approved after years of debate.
Peter @NCBurkeCenter shares his experience visiting the Arab Sea, once the size of #lakehuron and is now almost empty b/c it was mismanaged/diverted. Can the #greatlakes go away? It’s not impossible. It’s happened in other parts of the world.
Western states are longer thinking about ways to divert water fr the #GreatLakes to arid western states. And that’s due to the Great Lakes Compact, which prohibits them, says Peter Annin @NCBurkeCenter
*story, not *sorry! Amateur live tweeter tonight!)
It’s kind of a long sorry.... Reversal of the #ChicagoRiver, audacious plan as it was in the late 1800s, reversed the river to send sewage away fr #lakemichigan. Current diversion led to several #supremecourt rulings that keep the diversion....for now.
Jumping right in, @scribeguy asks why #Chicago gets to have a major water diversion (billions of gallons) w/out giving it back to the Lakes but other communities can’t get the same? https://t.co/1NkUBHYrHG

@lymancwelch Thanks, Lyman! Happy (belated) birthday.
Thanks to everyone who attended the #ProtectingTheGreatLakesWebinar! Visit https://t.co/iXSxwRmtpb for more and to download the toolkit.
Question: Is there anything in the toolkit on water diversion? 		Answer: It is not in the toolkit. Water diversion issues are a hot topic, especially in Southeast Wisconsin. It's top of mind for people in the area, and should be for candidates.
Question: How do I register to vote? 		Answer: your local country board of elections office or website is a good place to start. There's also information on your secretary of state website.
Question: Sometimes it's hard to get a letter to the editor published. Is it better to write to smaller publications? 		Answer: I think it's best to write to both! You don't have to choose one over the other.
Question: Will the Alliance be hosting any candidate forums? 		Answer: No, but we encourage you to attend forums relevant to your district.
Question: Do we work directly with Congress? 		Answer: The Alliance works directly with Congress in a bi-partisan fashion. We also do a lot of work with our supporters, like you!
Question: Would we publish a scorecard on elected officials and candidates? 		Answer: We are a non-partisan organization. That means we don't take positions on candidates. So, we will not provide scorecards for candidates.
Question: Do you recommend emailing candidates and do you include that method in the toolkit? 		Answer: Direct email is great, and we encourage everyone who uses that method to reach out to all of the campaigns. The toolkit includes issues so that you can tailor your message.
Question: What is a good strategy to ensure that candidates are sincere and sharing their direct opinion? 		Answer: Personalizing your questions and making it clear why an issue is important. Ask specific questions and push for specific answers.
Question: Does the toolkit provide a template letter to the editor? 		Answer: We do not provide templates for letters, but we do include a summary of the briefing Molly just gave you.
We'll now take questions from Twitter and from viewers of the #ProtectingTheGreatLakesWebinar. Let us know your questions!
We want to hear how you protected the Great Lakes this election season! Report back and tell us how you used the toolkit. #ProtectingTheGreatLakesWebinar https://t.co/BgsHYNDuyL

Follow outlets, informally engage with candidates, and discuss #GreatLakes issues on social media. #ProtectingTheGreatLakesWebinar https://t.co/uSFhxClpMA
You can also write a letter to the editor of a local publication, or write an #OpEd. Candidates and staff keep tabs on these opinion pages. #ProtectingTheGreatLakesWebinar https://t.co/osAGhZ3430
A great way to make your voice is heard is to attend a candidate forum. You can ask a candidate where they stand on Great Lakes and water issues. #ProtectingTheGreatLakesWebinar https://t.co/5QBb4tmbQ6

"I’m asking all of us to examine our expectations of Great Lakes leadership. To celebrate progress, to seek to unify, but not to settle." 		-@JoelBrammeier, @A4GL President &amp; CEO, on political courage for a clean water future. 		https://t.co/JhniSwsKXR
Today, @NOAA released its official forecast: they’re predicting another huge algal bloom in #LakeErie this year. 		We took some time to break down what’s being done to solve this man-made problem, and what it means for the people of Lake Erie.		https://t.co/kVYysmhBlk
RT @OhioEnviro: @A4GL @OhioEnviro supports the executive order, it's the first step in finding the best process and funding for this issue…
Thank you again to our panelists and partners, @FreshwaterFutur, @MichiganLCV, @OhioEnviro, &amp; Junction Coalition for putting the #LakeErieWebinar together with us. #LakeErieWebinar
You can help Lake Erie right now by making your voice heard. Tell Michigan Gov. Snyder, Ohio Gov. Kasich and Premier Ford of Ontario to act now for a clean Lake Erie: https://t.co/6cdTd6jQmM
Lake Erie – and every Great Lake – ought to be clean and safe for all people, not so polluted that it is a threat to our health and our regional economy. #LakeErieWebinar
#LakeErieWebinar Question 9: How much does residential fertilizer contribute to the problem? 		A: Res. fertilizer is not a big driver of harmful algal blooms in Western Lake Erie.
#LakeErieWebinar Question 8: Are there any resources for teaching students about the issue? 		A: @ohioseagrant has a number of great resources for the public, and you can submit questions for experts. Additionally, @HeidelbergU has a great website surrounding the issue.
#LakeErieWebinar Question 7: Are there any federal policies surrounding nutrient reduction? 		A: One of the most significant programs to reduce agricultural runoff is the Farm Bill. It earmarks funds to help farmers reduce polluted runoff. It is important but voluntary.
#LakeErieWebinar Question 6: Is there any info regarding Lake Michigan's algal blooms? 		A: Lake Michigan experiences algal blooms frequently in Green Bay, also from agricultural runoff. They occur in shallower and warmer areas. Storm water runoff is also a contributing factor.
#LakeErieWebinar Question 5: What criteria was used to identify the 8 watersheds in Gov. Kasich's EO? 		A: Ohio EPA identified them because they exceeded by 2 or 3 times the phosphorous loading index. They will require very specified effort to bring the phosphorous level down.
#LakeErieWebinar Question 4: What can I do in my every day life to help the Great Lakes? 		A: You can use a footprint calculator to understand how much water you're using.
#LakeErieWebinar Question 3: Who would enforce a ban on spreading manure on frozen ground? And how? 		A: a citizen would have to initiate a complaint, and the Ohio Dept. of Agriculture would investigate.
#LakeErieWebinar Question 2: Why is monitoring important to this effort? 		A: monitoring is critical. It is going on, but more is needed. It's needed further up in the watershed so we can understand what the water quality is like in smaller streams that feed into larger rivers.
.@A4GL is supportive of the executive order. We believe that it is a step in the right direction, but as a stand-alone action it will not solve the problem.
We'll now be taking questions! #LakeErieWebinar		Question 1: Could your groups touch on whether they support or oppose Governor Kasichs executive order?
One thing that's missing from the action plans is the need to meet specific deadlines for implementing actions.
Additionally, we want to expand wetland restoration across all of the jurisdictions. Wetlands act like kidneys, and can filter out harmful pollutants to Lake Erie.
Molly Flanagan of @A4GL: We want all of the jurisdictions to ban the spreading of nutrients. We want comprehensive nutrient reduction plans. We want improved water quality monitoring so that we understand where the biggest problems are and what is working. #LakeErieWebinar
We believe that this DAP is a good starting point, but it is difficult to pick out actionable items. #LakeErieWebinar
There is a focus on 3 subwater sheds: Mouth of the Detroit River, Michigan's portion of the Maumee River, and the Raisin River.
Now an update from @MichiganLCV about the Michigan DAP. #LakeErieWebinar
Just yesterday, @JohnKasich "signed an executive order Wednesday to reduce agricultural runoff that contributes to toxic algae in Lake Erie by tightening state oversight in eight Northwest Ohio watersheds."		 Read more on that here: https://t.co/oD6zcMu6hB
The Ohio DAP relies heavily on voluntary practices. Likely, incentives will be required to meet the reduction.
.@OhioEnviro will update us on changes in Ohio, like the Ohio EPA designating western Lake Erie as impaired. #LakeErieWebinar
The new government elected in Ontario promised to continue to protect our water ways. But, it's important to make sure the new elected officials understand the importance of the work being done in Lake Erie.
We still have some concern that voluntary programs may not be enough. So, monitoring is key.
Where does it stand right now in Ontario? The main development is the release of the plan. The Canadian Domestic Action Plan includes over 125 commitments, including further restrictions on winter spreading of nutrients. #LakeErieWebinar
The Domestic Action Plan is a plan laid out between Canada and the U.S. to meet the commitment of reducing phosphorous flow into Lake Erie by 40%.
.@FreshwaterFutur is going to give an update on the domestic action plan and the work in Ontario. #LakeErieWebinar
People are stocking up on palettes of bottled water and worrying about being able to water their crops and gardens. #LakeErieWebinar
Junction Coalition will share an on-the-ground perspective: 		"The traumatic experience of not having access to clean water is long-lasting."
The bloom this year is projected to be smaller than in 2017, but still significant. #LakeErieWebinar https://t.co/mieys1c59I
Algal blooms are caused by agricultural runoff. Today the @NOAA issued it's annual algal bloom forecast for Lake Erie -- we can expect an algal bloom in Western Lake Erie. The question is: how bad will it be?
We'll start off today's #LakeErieWebinar by hearing from Crystal MC Davis of @A4GL

Tell the U.S. Department of Justice to hold U.S. Steel accountable and protect public health and #LakeMichigan: https://t.co/cPBGTwV895
Sadly, U.S. Steel has a track record of #CleanWaterAct violations - more than 50 in the past 5 years.
Right now, the U.S. Department of Justice is accepting comments on a settlement that sets penalties for U.S. Steel. It also details the changes the facility must make to be sure this doesn’t happen again.
The spill is unacceptable. This toxic chemical has no place near our drinking water.
The chemical spill closed public beaches, closed public drinking water intakes, and prompted the City of Chicago to perform emergency testing for its own nearby water supply.
In April 2017, U.S. Steel spilled hundreds of pounds of hexavalent chromium, a toxic chemical, into a waterway that flows into Lake Michigan.

This is urgent. Senate offices need to hear NOW that people oppose this harmful bill. Tell Senators, don't weaken rules on aquatic #InvasiveSpecies: https://t.co/hHtKm0zzsa
The vote is on the Coast Guard Authorization Act. Unfortunately, #VIDA has been added as a bad amendment. Legislation to support our nation's critical maritime and security needs should not be a place to weaken basic protections of the Great Lakes.
Aquatic #InvasiveSpecies, like zebra mussels and round gobies, have already caused serious harm to the #GreatLakes. They cost Great Lakes communities more than $200 million per year in damages.
#VIDA, an amendment to the bill the U.S. Senate is voting on, would roll back rules that protect the Great Lakes from invasive species.

.@JoelBrammeier: Thank you to everyone who joined us today. Your voice is needed now more than ever. Enviro protection is not at odds with the economy, public health, or opportunity. We're pleased to have you as part of that conversation. #GreatLakesPolicy
What are some other sources of plastic pollution? #GreatLakesPolicy		@JoelBrammeier: A lot of plastic pollution is coming in from rivers that flow into the GL, and fibers from laundry. Two very different sources that require different solutions.
The effects are only going to get worse, and cities need to invest in resilient infrastructure. #GreatLakesPolicy
@JoelBrammeier: Again, mayors see the most of the impact. It's concerning to hear a federal leader question climate change protection. We can already see the effects of climate change in the Great Lakes. Flooding, evaporation, water quality, etc.
Question: What does Scott Pruitt's position on climate change have to say about preparing the Great Lakes for the negative impact of climate change?
How much influence does Canada have on #GreatLakesPolicy? 		@JoelBrammeier: CA plays a vital role in protecting the lakes. I can not stress enough the importance of Canadian leaders leading by example. @IJCsharedwaters ensures integrity of future GL plans.
RT @ecorangerfairmo: water, water, water https://t.co/D2jUsxhScX
Molly Flanagan: The state of IL needs to be a leader on #GreatLakes issues. One way to do that is to work to keep #AsianCarp out of the lakes. #GreatLakesPolicy
#GreatLakesPolicy question: What is the best way to approach a mayor to join the Great Lakes Cities Initiative? 		@JoelBrammeier: This is critical! Draw connections b/w fed gov't and what cities can accomplish as a result. Check out @healthylakes examples of local accomplishments
#GreatLakesPolicy question: How can we get involved? 		.@JoelBrammeier: A few ways! Look into your local orgs. With the Alliance, you can be a volunteer advocate at https://t.co/NcgkKqgizC or volunteer to clean a beach at https://t.co/5feKl1Od1J
#GreatLakesPolicy question: What is AGL's stance on Line 5? 		.@JoelBrammeier: Line 5 is the pipeline under straits of Mackinac. Our position is that that line should be decommissioned and that any oil transport alternatives should not put the lakes at risk.
Question from #GreatLakesPolicy audience member: You mentioned senate and governor races. What are your concerns for house members? 		Molly: All reps are up for election. Remember that the lakes are a bipartisan issue. Get candidates on the record supporting GL issues.
Question from #GreatLakesPolicy audience: What is the role of great lakes mayors? 		@JoelBrammeier: There is a coalition of mayors across the GL states and Canada. We strongly support the role of mayors who advocate for the lakes. They are key decision makers.
Question from #GreatLakesPolicy audience member: Are the D+ ratings national or just for the Great Lakes region? 		Molly: that is for the nation, but it's worth noting that our region has some of the oldest water infrastructure in the country.
Time for #GreatLakesPolicy questions from the audience! Question 1:	Who else are we partnering with? 	Molly: National Wildlife Federation, Michigan EC, @MichiganLCV, @FreshwaterFutur, and many many more who we rely on and work closely with.
.@JoelBrammeier tells us what to expect in 2018: 	-It's a midterm election year. 8 senate seats and 7 gov seats up for election in Great Lakes region.		#GreatLakesPolicy
Our next federal priority is plastic pollution. The majority of the plastic in the Great Lakes are fragments that had broken down from bottles or bags. #GreatLakesPolicy https://t.co/9lEWvJYev9
AGL supports clear, measurable plans to reduce nutrient pollution into Lake Erie, and keeping the promise to reduce nutrient pollution by 40% by 2020. #GreatLakesPolicy
Our next federal priority for 2018 is curbing nutrient pollution that cause toxic algal blooms. https://t.co/EYNyKVi5Rc
AGL supports tripling the amount of money available for the drinking water state revolving fund. We also support establishing a program that helps low income households afford clean drinking water. #GreatLakesPolicy
Molly Flanagan: Another federal priority for 2018 is clean drinking water. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave our drinking water infrastructure poor grades. #GreatLakesPolicy https://t.co/Uco8kz4JWU
AGL wants the @USACEHQ to complete it's Brandon Road study on time #GreatLakesPolicy
Last summer, an Asian Carp was found just 9 miles from Lake Michigan. #GreatLakesPolicy https://t.co/rU0mRVsq9I
AGL opposes any effort to weaken ballast water protections, despite pushback from the shipping industry. #GreatLakesPolicy
That means maintaining existing ballast water protection AND stopping #AsianCarp from entering the lakes. #GreatLakesPolicy
Molly Flanagan: Another one of our federal priorities for 2018 is to keep invasive species out of the Great Lakes. #GreatLakesPolicy https://t.co/vLIpAdpSKy
The @BrookingsInst found that for every $1 invested in the Great Lakes, the region sees a $2 return. #GreatLakesPolicy

The Healing Our Waters Coalition is an important ally in this work #GreatLakesPolicy https://t.co/oLdwCp54Wq

All of the states and the province have taken steps to #RescueLakeErie, but they all need to do more.
One thing everyone can do right now is call their gov or premier and ask them to keep their 40% reduction promise: https://t.co/KKHeInHxG9
@JustinTrudeau @POTUS @JustinTrudeau and his governing party can look to the GLRI &amp; consider a similar initiative with yr after yr funding
@JustinTrudeau @POTUS @POTUS can support the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.
What can @JustinTrudeau and @POTUS do to help this effort? #RescueLakeErie
There is wide understanding among farmers that spreading on frozen ground is not a good soil management practice / is wasteful.
Right now, there are not enough people on the ground to inspect / audit / enforce. Right now it is a complaint-driven system.
Q: How implementable is a ban on manure application on frozen ground?
They did not commit to the 40% reduction by 2025. We hope they will in the future. #RescueLakeErie
Short answer: they're not doing much. They are a contributor to pollution but don't have any Lake Erie shoreline. Have ducked responsibility
Q: What about Indiana? Indiana is part of the Lake Erie watershed. What are they doing? #RescueLakeErie
Unfortunately not. The clean water act provides some protection on the US side. Up to individual jurisdictions to work with federal govt.
Q: Do any entities control or govern the Great Lakes as a whole?
We will now take questions #RescueLakeErie
View the report at https://t.co/k9qfOgwu8n #RescueLakeErie
This report is a baseline assessment, in that this is our 1st comprehensive look. But not our last. Will revisit regularly. #RescueLakeErie
We need to be driving action at the policy level. #RescueLakeErie
None of the jurisdictions have the policies in place to meet reduction goal right now. Immediate and sustained action is needed.
Progress has been mixed / lackluster #RescueLakeErie
Key takeaways from report as a whole #RescueLakeErie
What we need to get to as we further improve frameworks is more investment and more accountability. #RescueLakeErie
Only 3% of farms that need to adhere to nutrient management act were inspected as of 2013. Significant gap. #RescueLakeErie #Accountability
Field cropping operations are exempt from the policy, but that's the majority of farmland. #RescueLakeErie
You can't apply manure to frozen ground, but can apply to saturated ground. #RescueLakeErie
Assessment of Ontario's progress #RescueLakeErie https://t.co/uQbcQfdZNT
Domestic Action Plan was developed by local gov't in Ontario and with gov't of Canada. Robust, but lack of timeline and clear responsibility

Assessment of Michigan's progress #RescueLakeErie https://t.co/1nGQsI0rpj
State of MI is the only state that doesn't have a septic code.
Michigan does not have policies in place to reduce algal blooms right now. #RescueLakeErie
What's going on in Michigan? #RescueLakeErie
Finally, needs to practice water quality monitoring -- especially on some of the smaller watersheds. #RescueLakeErie
Ohio also needs to utilize green infrastructure to lessen the impact of stormwater runoff. #RescueLakeErie
Additionally, need to develop nutrient management plans.
Ohio needs to completely ban the spreading of fertilizer on frozen ground. #RescueLakeErie
Ohio is the main contributor of phosphorous pollution, and bears a lot of the repercussions. #RescueLakeErie https://t.co/rUW10C9NQI
What's happening in Ohio? #RescueLakeErie
40% phosphorous reduction goal will never be met if OH, MI, and ON don't act urgently. #RescueLakeErie
Overall, progress has been slow. All of the jurisdictions are lacking policies that fully address the critical issues. #RescueLakeErie
We use a 3 tier approach to progress: 		1.) non-existent, 	2.) incomplete, or 	3.) complete. 		#RescueLakeErie
Reviews state and provincial legislation and regulations to reduce nutrient pollution, as well as their accountability. #RescueLakeErie
The purpose of the report is to assess progress towards the 40% phosphorous reduction goal.  #RescueLakeErie
Let's get into the report. What does it show? #RescueLakeErie
Next week the lake Erie governors and Premier are meeting. They should update you on progress to #RescueLakeErie
In 2015 governors agreed to a 40% reduction of phosphorous into Lake Erie. #RescueLakeErie
Find that report here: https://t.co/k9qfOgwu8n https://t.co/2uLiL3KetV
The report that we're releasing today is an assessment of progress to clean up lake Erie from Ontario, Ohio, and Michigan #RescueLakeErie

Thank you to everyone who attended and tuned into #thinkndrink! We'll be posting a link to the talk shortly.
@danpatrickegan its a good intermediate step to stop an immediate invasion of asian carp.
Q: do you have a position on the army corps most recent study?		#thinkndrink
That's what knocked out drinking water in toledo
Now its microcystis algae, which muscles don't eat.
Theres not more phosphorus going into the lake, its the form of it. Dissolved and reactive. Increased rain and increased lake temps.
Q: can you comment on agricultural runoff problems? #thinkndrink
@danpatrickegan fisherman say yes, im not so sure. They still taste good though.
Q: do the whitefish and the trout that eat gobies taste as good as the old ones? #thinkndrink
@danpatrickegan I like the idea of a lake with a natural balance, but i also like the role salmon have played culturally and economically
@danpatrickegan we are headed for a new regime, and thats any species that can make a meal out of a goby. Salmon having a rough time.
Q: are we overdue for another fisheries upgrade? #thinkndrink
@danpatrickegan Killing two regulations for every one regulation introduced is not a good idea
@danpatrickegan weve gone a long way from the 1970s. Clean water act was designed to ratchet down pollution and its working.

@danpatrickegan new admin proposed gutting GLRI, they were surprised by bipartisan backlash by states. Not a R or D issue at all.
Can you talk about the political landscape around fixing the great lakes?
#thinkndrink time for audience questions!
.@danpatrickegan the lakes aren't worried about us. #thinkndrink
@monicaeng @danpatrickegan @danpatrickegan alternatively, polar vortex held in water and caused lake levels to rise.
@monicaeng @danpatrickegan things are changing, especially with ice coverage. Lakes start heating up &amp; evaporating.
.@monicaeng what can we expect about rising or lowering lake levels due to climate change? #thinkndrink

Was the st.lawrence seaway a mistake in the end? #thinkndrink
@danpatrickegan zebra mussels have taken plankton down to 10% their original population #thinkndrink
@danpatrickegan asian carp are large and charismatic, it makes sense they are drawing peoples attention. #thinkndrink
#thinkndrink https://t.co/22Y8YwpNyM
@danpatrickegan in terms of invasive species, hard to say where attention should be. Ppl are most concerned about asian carp, appropriately.
@danpatrickegan the front door of the lakes are the canals and the backdoor is right here in Chicago
#thinkndrink no need to be fatalistic. There is work to be done but there is a growing consciousness and care for the lakes. https://t.co/sjjKVA6FC0

NY &amp; PA are not responsible for western lake Erie basin issues, but are submitting their plans for pollution reduction. https://t.co/7yrpPe3IVz
There are dead zones in the central basin of lake Erie, and nuisance algae in eastern lake Erie. https://t.co/7yrpPe3IVz
Last question: What are the roles of PA and NY in pollution reduction? #ErieWebinar
Lake St. Clair algae water issues are from infrastructure and sewer overflows. https://t.co/60toNWVx0t
Algal blooms in lakes and rivers in Michigan happen every summer. https://t.co/60toNWVx0t
Question: How are parts of Michigan impacted by this issue? #ErieWebinar
To give less money to the agencies working to improve the situation is backwards progress.
It is very important that the Environmental Protection Agency have the funding needed to protect our clean air and water. #ErieWebinar
In Ontario, the local conservation authority does a huge amount of work on water quality and report cards. #ErieWebinar https://t.co/kQwClOx28B
@ohioseagrant has a number of research articles on the implications of the blooms https://t.co/kQwClOx28B
.@NOAA_GLERL puts out a weekly forecast with helpful information about blooms in western lake Erie. #ErieWebinar https://t.co/kQwClOx28B
Question: What are some of the best internet resources for Great Lakes water quality? #ErieWebinar
3 actions identified are not enough to achieve it, but they are important first steps.
Total elimination in blooms almost impossible, but we can reduce them most of the time.
Scientific consensus from many sources is that 40% will not eliminate algal blooms but will reduce their occurrence. https://t.co/CGnx3xC2Wb
How was the 40% goal arrived at? #ErieWebinar
Farm bureau is encouraging members to get on board to develop nutrient management plan. #ErieWebinar
No one is ACTIVELY opposed to a clean Lake Erie. There is opposition to regulations. https://t.co/OQYcW9w6Qs
Question: Who is organized to oppose actions taken to reduce 40%?
Staff and resources allotted to do random audits. Ability to dispatch someone quickly to document issue. Educate farmers on the issue. https://t.co/UrnvVi4zsB
Question: How would bans be enforced? #ErieWebinar
Sometimes farmers do not have appropriate storage and need to dispose of manure. Should not be spread as a disposal technique. https://t.co/qBOg8spVzp
Question: Why do farmers insist on applying manure on frozen ground? #ErieWebinar
Ultimately, agricultural community are the primary contributors and that is where the most change needs to come from. #ErieWebinar https://t.co/Nsy2wOpSrr
Don't apply phosphorous fertilizer to your lawn, don't shower/do laundry during big rain storms https://t.co/Nsy2wOpSrr
Question: What can individuals do in their daily lives to reduce nutrient pollution? #ErieWebinar
Thank you to Freshwater Future, The Ohio Environmental Council, and Michigan League of Conservation Voters for collaborating on #ErieWebinar
Money needs to be spent strategically to enforce 40% reduction in Ontario. #ErieWebinar
BUT most of the Erie land in Ontario is used for field crops. #ErieWebinar
Ontario does require a nutrient management plan, but only for livestock operations above a certain size. #ErieWebinar
There are rules in place in Ontario, but the actual enforcement falters. #ErieWebinar
Manure may not be spread on frozen ground, but can be spread on saturated ground. #ErieWebinar
Ontario: 	1.) Incomplete	2.) Incomplete	3.) Incomplete
Ohio has seen good baby steps, but more needs to be done. #ErieWebinar
We need common sense regulation to curb the pollution damaging the water. #ErieWebinar
Plans to expand water monitoring stations in Lake Erie from Ohio #ErieWebinar
There ARE restrictions on manure spreading, but they are filled with loopholes and unenforceable. #ErieWebinar
Ohio: 	1.) Incomplete	2.) Incomplete	3.) Incomplete
Michigan does water quality monitoring, but funding is running out &amp; plans for future monitoring have not been formulated or discussed.
Michigan: 	1.) Non-existent	2.) Non-existent	3.) Incomplete
Progress on these 3 actions varies by area. Let's look at each. #ErieWebinar
1.) Ban manure spreading on frozen ground	2.) Comprehensive nutrient reduction plan	3.) water quality monitoring https://t.co/I4Osga1tz2
What needs to happen to meet the 40% goal? #ErieWebinar
So far, action plans are unenforceable and vague -- may not help meet 40% reduction target. #ErieWebinar
Unfortunately, progress towards that commitment has been very slow. https://t.co/eFKlBJe5S9
2 yrs ago gov's of Ohio and Michigan and premier of Ontario committed to reducing flow of nutrient pollution by 40% #ErieWebinar
Cities have made moves and spent billions to keep sewage out of the Great Lakes, but agriculture industry is mostly unregulated #ErieWebinar
Also comes from cities and sewage systems. https://t.co/02CSe5TRGn
Where is extra nutrient pollution coming from? Main source is farms; manure runoff and fertilizer. #ErieWebinar
The answer is nutrient pollution. It collects in the water and causes the blooms. Makes water toxic. https://t.co/UxShiyvHfb
Molly Flanagan asks, what causes the toxic algal blooms? #ErieWebinar
It could grow to be the largest in recent years. https://t.co/G2qV7rqdA1
This year, a significant algal bloom is predicted for Lake Erie. #ErieWebinar

We will be sending an email with key takeaways, recording, and resources for contacting legislators later today. #AGLwebinar
@JoelBrammeier: Report on risks due out this year. At AGL we are looking at alternative oil transport risks. Reports out in coming months. https://t.co/hwFd1uY60d
#AGLwebinar audience question: update on Line 5? (Oil pipeline under straits of mackinac in MI)
Would also eliminate region 5 organizational office, which oversees implementation. https://t.co/HmoUWg128C
@JoelBrammeier: GLRI cuts would eliminate funding to communities and on-the-ground work. https://t.co/HmoUWg128C
#AGLwebinar audience question: what will be the impact on region 5 ongoing projects with epa budget cuts?
MF: it's not as though there are businesses that *want* unclean water. https://t.co/E5olUI7Xyl
MF: lots of businesses rely on clean water. Breweries rely on clean water and are active and vocal in GL protection. https://t.co/E5olUI7Xyl
#AGLwebinar audience question: what are the business/industry impacts of reduced clean water protections?
@JoelBrammeier: there is a GL task force caucus. The GL congressional caucus is bipartisan. Organized by NE MW institute. https://t.co/RSPSsHVBMz
#AGLwebinar audience question: is there any org structure among GL congressional delegation? Or is it seperated by individual members?
RT @CleCityCouncil: Lake Erie events in and around #CLE. https://t.co/ihozPu7zde
MF: there is a balance of power in place. Bolster your member of congress. https://t.co/iFlOQZbWC2
MF: depends on exec order. The president can sign an exec order to set intentions but still requires act of congress or agency to implement. https://t.co/wTKr1C1dOW
#AGLwebinar Audience member question: role executive orders play in policy? Are there emerging issues that will be effected?
MF: like to see work their communities are doing. Invite members of congress to come out and see projects. Share stories. Get msg across. https://t.co/gqjaXPvGwc

Crystal Davis: this is an issue that isn't just pertinent to wealthy folks. Transcends race and socioeconomic lines. https://t.co/vWVNRfr61w
.@JoelBrammeier: we have to make sure that the protections we depend on are available to everyone in the region. https://t.co/vWVNRfr61w
#AGLwebinar audience questions: is conservation an elitist activity?
Additionally, you can ask them what *more* you can do to help. https://t.co/SnqOfIzaxb
Also, share your stories with members of your congress. It helps them and the cause. https://t.co/SnqOfIzaxb
Definitely. Call, email, write, tweet your thank you's to legislators on the side of the Great Lakes. https://t.co/SnqOfIzaxb
#AGLwebinar Audience member question: is it still important to contact elected officials who have already voiced GL support?
Ideological component to budget: assumes work should be done by states, not fed gov't. @JoelBrammeier does not believe that is possible. https://t.co/SaoUBF5pmZ

@chadjfoo Thanks for being interested in and advocating for GL health! We need more concerned citizens like you, Chad!
@chadjfoo The Chicago diversion was a wholly separate thing. Compact allows for communities straddling the basin to apply. Not other states.
@chadjfoo Which list are you referring to? Waukesha is 1st city to request GL water using the GL Compact: https://t.co/OdXqMuNJjN
@kristinH2O Yikes.
@chadjfoo Hey Chad, any city that wants a diversion of Great Lakes water has to go through the rigorous application process, like Waukesha.

Questions? #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
Migratory fishes connect a number of different #GreatLakes systems! #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
How quickly do migratory fishes use a restored habitat? #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
Male bowfin get a bright green belly during spawning! #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
An artificial construct can change the landscape of an area, creating obstacles for migratory fish. #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
@DrFishSG @SolomonRDavid Perfect material for a LUNCH and learn.
Dams are being removed in order to open up habitats from migratory fishes. Interesting! #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
It's clearly difficult to not include #StarWars references in his presentation. #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
It takes a lot of energy to spawn upstream, but the eggs are better protected than they would be in a lake. #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
If you've reduced pollution but aren't producing young fish have you reduced pollution enough? Maybes not. #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
Some Lake Whitefish eat invasives like round gobies! He has a picture of their digestive tract. Kinda gross. #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
River migration may be a result of habitat restoration. #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
Oops. Powerpoint has encountered an unexpected error. Stay tuned. #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
Still can't get over how cool otoliths are. #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
#DidYouKnow about otoliths? It's a stone that grows in the skull of a fish. It's rings allows scientists to determine age. Like a tree!
Reemergence of Lake Whitefish migration has been seen the past 5-10 years. Why? #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
So many fish may be using the North #LakeMichigan habitat that they may be spilling over into other habitats. #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
Lake Whitefish is the most economically important commercial fish in Lake Michigan. #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
#GreenBay sees a high richness of migrant species. #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
At what temperature do most species spawn? 11-15 degrees. (celcius, duh.) #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
When are the most species spawning throughout the year in the #GreatLakes? Peak from April-June. #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
He created a list of Great Lakes migratory fishes. Whoa! The sections were "naughty" &amp; "nice." Just kidding. #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
His favorite is the Gar (for its ease of use in puns.) #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
The #GreatLakes are made up of several different landscapes: marshes, inland lakes, rivers, streams. #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
Spawning behavior of #asianCarp is destructive to vegetation and disruptive to sediment. #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
Invasive species are another huge threat to biodiversity. #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
Top two threats to biodiversity: habitat loss &amp; #climatechange. #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
40% of fish are freshwater. Huge biodiversity in freshwater systems. #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
29k species of fish known in the world today. #LunchAndLearn @SolomonRDavid
It's raining at our Chicago office. It's like we're underwater with the fish @SolomonRDavid is talking about. Right? #LunchAndLearn

We're seeing increases of phosphorous coming from sources off land - a lot of them are agricultural. @JoelBrammeier
Don't we need nutrients? They're a good thing - too much of a good thing overwhelms the system. Leads to toxic algal blooms. @JoelBrammeier

Has water quality awareness among landowners changed since 2007? #phosphorus #how15
It is not always the case that the root of poor water quality is urban sources. #phosphorus #how15
In 2007 a survey concluded that water quality awareness is low. #phosphorus #how15

Bottom line: it's important to study migration patterns so that we can be informed while developing wind energy and not disrupt nature.
Stop over habitat is where birds stop to chill out during migration. They hope to eat and not be eaten. #birdmigration #how15
Why is the shoreline special? The great lakes are an obstacle to #birdmigration. Birds are likely to use it as stop over habitat.
Work with wind energy companies to reduce the development of wind energy development in high migration traffic zones. #birdmigration #how15
.@IndianaDunesNPS #greatmarsh in #INDunes restoration helped by #GLRI &amp; ingenuity. Staff used snowshoes to avoid sinking into peat!
How do we use this to inform policy in the Great Lakes region? #birdmigration #how15
Bats are very active when there is low wind speed 	#birdmigration #how15
Bat activity decreases in October - most of the bugs have died. They either hibernate or head south. #birdmigration #how15
There is more bat activity in the Great Lakes region (especially northern Wisconsin) than in the rest of the country

Acoustic monitoring tools CAN differentiate between birds and bats (and species!) #birdmigration #how15
Each species of bats has a different ultrasonic call #birdmigration #how15 #EEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Acoustic monitors have bat mics and bird mics to listen for ultrasonic calls #birdmigration #how15
The zone of danger for birds is called the rotor swept zone (where the rotors sweep through!) #birdmigration #how15
This technology can be used to assess the risk of placing wind turbines in particular areas. #birdmigration #how15
Aviation radar allows us to trace where birds are coming from #birdmigration #how15
There are yearly variations between the migration patterns. #birdmigration #how15
Migration doesn't occur every single night. It's a pulse nature. #birdmigration #how15
Migration starts around the first of September and ends around late October. #birdmigration #how15
The objects they pick up on the radar are called targets #birdmigration #how15
Radar can not tell the difference between birds and bats. #birdmigration #how15
Horizontal radar provides a birds eye view. Vertical radar allows for high altitude tracking. #birdmigration #how15

@ElenaMDove @stopthenukedump hi Elena! What is this petition about? We'd love to learn more.
@badgertopspin ❤💧🐮
@scootlez any time Adam
@justCennet exactly
@badgertopspin yes, it's an issue. Agriculture needs to be treated more like the industry it is - including how they manage waste.
@mkumbalek we don't believe there is a thorough enough safety net in place for cleanups.
Sea lampreys are blood sucking varmints. Literally - parasites that suck the blood out of fish. Decimated some game fish populations.
@scootlez great question. there are so many wonderful local watershed groups. Here in Chicago we recommend friends of the Chicago river.
@cbrooks816 good question. In 2008 and 2012 candidates had GL platform points. We hope future candidates will echo that commitment.
@mkumbalek good question. Moving large volumes of heavy crude across the Great Lakes kinda seems like a bad call.
It's a law that any water you take from the #GreatLakes has to eventually be put back.
The Great Lakes Compact states that we will never allow the diversion of #GreatLakes water.
In the US states have a lot of power over their own water. #EarthDay
Question from the audience: are there things being done to prevent people in drought areas from coming for #GreatLakes water?
A cow produces 18x more waste than a human. Trust me, it's relevant. #TheMoreYouKnow #EarthDay
Great Rivers Chicago is an excellent initiative for a healthier Chicago river. #GreatLakes #EarthDay
