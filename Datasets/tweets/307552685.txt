Education is the best way to reduce vulnerability of communities and increase competitiveness.
US companies are seeking a business environment where contracts, intellectual property rights, trademarks and rule of law are respected.
To take full advantage of these opportunities and attract additional foreign investment a favorable investment climate is critical.
There are still many untapped opportunities.  The DR has characteristics and competitive advantages that bode well for continued growth:
