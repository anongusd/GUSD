@LibertyConv @GMann_19 @jaketapper Thanks for asking. The power grid for almost all Texas, a huge state, is over 17% electric and growing, thanks in part to support from then-Gov. Rick Perry: https://t.co/q8Ew9vwgbh Smaller states like Kansas are far over 20%, also growing.
And if you doubt the stats, @daveJay, have a look for yourself. https://t.co/JaDabmMq7l
Thanks for asking. A moment’s search shows that ERCOT, which manages almost all Texas electricity, so far gets over 17% from wind, enough to power an entire smaller state. More than nuclear: https://t.co/q8Ew9vwgbh Note the last sentence of the tweet to which you replied. https://t.co/BDOjXUTtR1
There is a real question about wind energy storage: how to save it for when the wind doesn’t blow? Experts like Steven Chu have proposed solutions. But wind already does a lot. There’s nothing so revealing as a person exposing his ignorance while calling other people stupid.
This was an understandable joke in, say, 1987. Today, states that voted for the president (Texas, Kansas and the Dakotas come to mind) draw much electricity from wind farms, which bring profits to local land owners, to whom TV is available 24/7, regardless of who they voted for. https://t.co/wNO8G1uvtK

What is the actual criticism by specialists? That diplomacy takes more time. Same as @RepDanCrenshaw is saying:		ROBERT GALLUCCI: That doesn't mean it has to take four years. But it, you know, may well take more than four weeks.
Also:		DAN DREZNER: This is a good outcome in the sense that Donald Trump did not get completely swindled. He went to the poker table, and he left the poker table with some of his chips.
Q. Did he make the right move in walking away?		SUSAN RICE: Yes, he did. For the United States to have agreed to lift all sanctions in the absence of real and complete denuclearization would have been a tremendous mistake.
This by @RepDanCrenshaw is misleading. Many mainstream critics gave Trump credit, said he was right to walk away from a bad deal - like Susan Rice here: https://t.co/NF6yyF7GZW and several experts here: https://t.co/fnI2RIj0Ls Some did call the summit risky or ill-planned. https://t.co/pwXHWPSyF5

Equally interesting, from video:	Trump: “You’re supposed to be able to rely on your attorney.”	Hannity: “Attorney-client privilege.”	Trump, apparently grasping that’s not really what attorney-client privilege means: “Well, but it’s also called ‘reliance.’”
Wait. Hannity, who says he’s not a journalist, says that Cohen, whom he has dismissed as a liar, repeatedly told him that Trump is innocent. So we should believe what Cohen is said to have said to Hannity, not the checks the president wrote. Is that it? https://t.co/BusCQsUTb0

This is similar to the view of @AmbassadorRice on @MorningEdition today: The summit was a big risk, which gave Kim benefits. But, she says, it was the right move to walk. https://t.co/vfSXUk44ZR
@_toriwhitley Thank you.
@hey_hashbrown Am inclined to agree with @TheAmaraReport that this is all absurd. The one defense of it, however, is that Congressional rules are among the few remaining limits on sharp and personal attacks anywhere in our public discourse.
@hey_hashbrown In the specific situation, the rules and traditions of Congress allow criticism of acts but not impugning character. This called for Tlaib to restate her accusation in a way Jordan could not go adage her. It’s like what happened to Warren, who would not adjust (“she persisted”).
@hey_hashbrown There’s a lot in here. Presumably people think a “racist act” can be described as a mistake, while being called “a racist” suggests your entire belief system is warped. It’s like the distinction Cohen tried to draw between “lying” and being “a liar.”
In 1974, during the final months of Watergate, Richard Nixon held a summit in Moscow with Soviet leader Leonod Brezhnev. Woodward and Bernstein’s “Final Days” describes anxiety that Nixon would make a bad deal in hopes of saving his political fortunes. Nixon made no major deals.

@hughhewitt Thanks, that’s fair also. The border security agreement did as you suggest, with $1.375b In barrier money alongside money for other border security methods, and all in line with what relevant committees authorized. Seems many stakeholders were heard and their priorities weighed.
@BMoore4WVU @hughhewitt Thanks, you mistake me for “the left,” but let’s look at “will curtail.” The question is: Will 200 miles of extra barrier on a 1,900 mile border save a specific number of lives, more than other methods? If yes, what evidence shows it? Why were many GOP’s in Congress unpersuaded?
@hughhewitt This is not to say that drug interdiction is useless or that barriers are irrelevant. But it seems a challenge to demonstrate that X miles of a wall will save X lives, or any lives. Might a wall best be weighed against other techniques in, say, an appropriations process?
@hughhewitt No idea if that’s lowball, but let’s stipulate there must be some number. What evidence shows a wall will cause a single person with an untreated addiction not to find drugs brought in other ways? Can we reasonably predict one addict saying, “Guess there’s a wall now, I quit”?

There's a contrast between "Skin" and, say, "12 Years a Slave." Granted that's a feature film, thus not a fully fair comparison with a short. But "12 Years" has multiple, compelling black and white characters, who respond to a horrible system in different and very human ways. END
In fairness, race in America is in large measure a story of white people, whose struggles with race deserve examination in film. But it's also a story of people of color, who can be depicted as characters with lives, rather than props around whom white people enact their dramas.
Some are victims and others seek vengeance. That's all we learn. It brings to mind the 1980's film "Mississippi Burning," a well-acted Gene Hackman/Willem Dafoe film about a 1960's civil rights episode that neglected to have any meaningful black characters.
... the film dwells on the white racist in a way that makes him sympathetic. He's an attentive father, a respectful husband, a man with  a home. He is, in short, a character; the story is about him. By contrast, the black characters aren't developed and say only a few words.
One short film, "Skin," was notable in a different way, besides a child in peril. The film centers on a white racist father. He's made to fit every stereotype: white trash, alcoholic, with tattoos, American flags, and firearms, guilty of a horrendous racist act. And yet...
One of the five, "Marguerite," was a poignant exception. All others depicted pointless or unexplained cruelty and death involving children. Granted, such things happen - one dramatizes a true story - and granted, those scenes I was able to watch were well acted and shot.
Like any number of journalists, I’ve covered wars, walked through hospitals, seen aerial bombardments and bodies in streets, visited Baghdad morgues. I could not bear to watch many of the scenes in the short films and spent much time studying the floor.
At the close of the final film, in which (spoiler alert) an 8-year-old shoots his father, a web address appeared on screen with a message to “Vote for the winner”! People loudly booed. In many years of moviegoing, including many Oscar shorts, I’ve never seen anything like this.
Watched the Oscar-nominated short films in a DC theater. In 5 live-action films, 2 children are killed; 1 disappears; three children kill people. The crowd grew audibly restive. As it became clear the final film featured heavily armed racists, one person shouted, “Kill me now!”

"I don't know," Moran continues, "whether Ralph Northam is pictured in that horrifically racist photo," and "I don't know if enabling Ralph Northam to have a second chance" to pursue racial justice would be bad. Our full talk: https://t.co/zywjKuJQjG @MorningEdition 2/2
A rare defense of @RalphNortham from former Cong. Jim Moran: "Commentators" are "unanimous" that Northam must go, but "They all tend to be young, attractive, bright and very sure of themselves. I'm none of those things... but I... know what I don't know." 1/2 @MorningEdition
Should the president declare a state of emergency to build a wall? @marcorubio: Border security is an "urgent problem," but "congress should do it... I do not believe a state of emergency is the best way to do it" because "it lets Congress off the hook." @MorningEdition
Overthrowing Venezuela's Maduro would deprive Cuba of an ally. Is the US targeting Venezuela to get at Cuba? @marcorubio: "It's certainly a by-product of our engagement," though it's "not the central rationale." The crisis "is destabilizing the entire region." @MorningEdition
Should the US intervene if Venezuelan forces arrest the opposition? @marcorubio tells @MorningEdition there may be a "legal rationale" to use force, but "I don't think about military force the way others do, because I don't think that's the best way to reach the best result."
.@marcorubio is hoping Venezuelan security forces will abandon President Nicolas Maduro. "I don't think they want to see a bloodbath. I don't think these military leaders, frankly, will listen to orders to fire on their own people."

There’s a case that Trump is, indeed, tough under “game-day” pressure when he can draw energy from an audience of fans; he’s kept going even when news is very bad. But it’s harder to argue this after, say, the game day with Putin in Helsinki, or all the game days of the shutdown. https://t.co/va7toTdceN

On @MorningEdition, @KellyannePolls argues for a “physical barrier” you can’t “climb over” or “crawl under.” Fair enough, but underlines the president’s focus on individual migrants, often asylum seekers; many lawmakers worry about drugs shopped through legal ports of entry.

... In the past decade public media have invested substantially in stronger journalism. And have been leaders in podcasts, news apps, radio news magazines and other means of delivering serious, lengthy, sustained examinations of our world.

Fair question. The trends @JillAbramson cites are the opposite of public media. Public media added staff as others slashed. Local @npr stations hired more reporters as local papers declined.

It’s true that officials who duck questions sometimes get worse coverage - but not for the petty reason Trump feared. Reporters who are shut out have to go find facts from the outside. They may end up with true stories that don’t fit the preferred narrative of insiders.
This may well be how the president thinks about reporters. In January 2016, Trump agreed to an NPR interview but didn’t schedule it for months. At last a close adviser said Trump might do it, but for one problem: Trump had strung us along so much that we must be biased by now.
First is the president’s confession that if someone didn’t return his call he would be inclined to treat them unfairly. Next is the not-quite-fully expressed fear that reporters think like him, and that he will get bad press from reporters if he fails to get back to them.
This is revealing on so many levels. https://t.co/lu4dOdjKCx

The 1800’s Western explorer John C. Fremont navigated by taking readings of the sun and stars: but it wasn’t useful unless he had also made meticulous readings in places he had previously been. Comparing the readings let him make a map. That’s what @throughlineNPR will do.
A bit of history: Lincoln said, “If we could first know where we are, and whither we are tending, we could better judge what to do.” History is how we find out where we are. @throughlineNPR aims to do as Lincoln said, although it seems unlikely they will say the word “whither.”
There’s never been a moment in my lifetime when people have felt more disoriented and out of place. History is how we recover our bearings, and grasp what is really happening around us. Which is what my colleagues at @throughlineNPR propose to do when the series starts soon.

The 37-year-old @PeteButtigieg also offered an phrase for 2020: "inter-generational justice." Doesn't want his generation to fall behind economically. He's asking "what kind of world this is going to be in 2054, which is when I'll reach the current age of the current president."
Thinking more about what @RepPeteAguilar said, he seemed to be saying to Republicans: Prove what’s needed with facts. There’s a provable need for tech at border crossings; and provable that DHS already has unspent barrier money. Want a wall? Prove the need for that too.

House committees are preparing investigations that will build an independent public record of the administration, and also preparing legislation the president will dislike. He will be dependent on McConnell to shield him; and it will be significant whenever McConnell does not.
McConnell, of course, can not get far ahead of his caucus - hard to say if he’d get 20 Republicans in a crisis. But he is potentially in an immensely powerful position. Trump faces a House speaker who’s shown her strength and has openly questioned his ties to Russia.
Knowing, as he does, that up to 47 Democrats could oppose the president in a confrontation, McConnell would need only 20 of 53 Republicans to stick with him to make 67 for a veto override. That is also the number required for conviction after impeachment.
McConnell insisted there was no point in passing legislation the president would veto; but of course he was understating the Senate’s full power. The Senate can pass a bill the president finds too painful to veto. The Senate can also override a veto.
It’s true that the executive is very powerful, and true that Congress has delegated or ceded vast powers to the executive for generations. In the shutdown, McConnell deferred entirely to the president for a month. Yet a word from McConnell and the president was finished.
The end of the shutdown is a reminder of where ultimate power lies under the Constitution. It lies with Congress. The president persisted in the shutdown only until McConnell warned him that Senate Republicans would not sustain him much longer.

This was also Lindsey Graham’s analysis weeks ago, that giving in would be “the end of his presidency.”		Doesn’t mean it will prove true; he’s still president, with all the powers of office. What failed was a particular approach to the presidency that sounded good on talk radio. https://t.co/K8mSfZ1di6
The president’s basic themes include: 		1) He’s smart	2) Others are stupid	3) He’ll use leverage others are too weak to use	4) Leverage means threatening or inflicting harm		It’s how he approached NATO, NAFTA, China, GM, etc. On the shutdown, none of these precepts was borne out.

@jessemeichner I’m just making observations here on the evidence at hand.
@jessemeichner Thanks - I don’t take issue with you liking the observation. My point is: to know what he (may be) saying, you have to already know beforehand what he was (maybe) trying to say; and you have to leave out the inaccurate parts. He didn’t express the idea so much as gesture to it.
There is real history here; Soviets invaded Afghanistan (actually supporting allies), and the war helped crack their empire. Not bad at all to learn from this. The president’s unfocused, inaccurate description suggests he was told this history, but hasn’t really internalized it. https://t.co/i1dat18mHn

Some are replying to this suggesting we lose words like “ripped” and “slammed,” too. I generally agree (without banning any word, they may be proper at times, just usually not). I assume news writers feel these words are more dramatic; they’re actually just less specific.
This is right. True for all politicos. Better to properly characterize each side’s argument rather than language suggesting both are the same (“feud,” “political back and forth,” etc). May be a few more words. May even force reporters to study the arguments! But more informative. https://t.co/DpqivpJbnt

@drjewest You can say: We need bread. To bake it we need flour. We need security. We need clothes. You can say: I want to put up paneling in my house. And also, We need a certain amount of wall along part of the border. In that context “we need wall” would be clear.
Doesn’t this clarify Kirstjen Nielsen’s much-mocked “We need wall”? Seems like perfectly plain English. It’s not A wall or THE wall. The administration wants some wall. Here and there. Also some steel fence, according to Trump tweets. And some other stuff. https://t.co/EqEDeOHfKv
What the president says he wants, in his own words and Kelly’s, is a mix of concrete, fence, technology and people: more of what is already there. He says he modified his idea after learning more. Just as you’d want a president to do! Except he also suggests he modified nothing.
And the president long ago abandoned the coast to coast wall idea, as you can read in this article from 2016: https://t.co/0RxxSnEJMl
Today the president tweets he “never abandoned” an “all concrete wall,” but then says why he abandoned an all concrete wall. He wants a wall that is “all concrete in some places” (!) plus non-concrete fence. There’s already some concrete, plus fence. https://t.co/y4Xe8RsciM
On his way out, Kelly says WH abandoned a concrete wall long ago. Trump has been describing “steel slat” fence, similar to some existing fence. Isn’t it false and misleading to keep saying he wants a wall? Obscures real debate over how to secure border.	 https://t.co/eWGsXjaYlv

Q. A second summit [with North Korea's Kim Jong Un] is going to happen?	@SecPompeo: "Counting on it."	We'll have a full transcript out later today, and you'll hear Secretary Pompeo on @npratc today and @MorningEdition tomorrow. @npr
.@secPompeo also broadly defended the administration's engagement: "You report that America is withdrawing from the world, when in fact just the opposite is taking place.... We stare at things that don't work anymore and demand that they begin to work." @NPR
GOP Sen. Lindsay Graham said US withdrawal leaves Kurdish allies open to attack, so we asked:	Q. What obligations does the US have to its Kurdish allies?	@SecPompeo: "We've been working for a long time... to get a political outcome in Syria that takes down the threat." @npr
Q. Is ISIS defeated?	@SecPompeo. "We've made the caliphate in Syria go away...We now have a battle, that is a long-time battle, which is a counter-terrorism battle, not only against ISIS... President Trump remains just as committed today as he was yesterday and the day before."

"That's not what we're aiming at," Bolton adds, meaning the US is not explicitly trying to make China open its political system. "But if the theory is correct, we'll see what flows from it." Web story shortly; hear him on @npratc today; more on @MorningEdition Friday.
What is the long-term US approach to China? Bolton says he hopes the economic changes the US is demanding during a 90-day negotiation will force some opening of their system. It could "have potentially profound impact on their political structure as well." @NPR @MorningEdition
In the @npr talk, @AmbJohnBolton says he doesn't know if Trump was aware in advance. Bolton declined to name the specific alleged crime by Meng Wonzhou of Huawei, but "Huawei is one company we've been concerned about" regarding intellectual property theft and dealing with Iran.
News: @AmbJohnBolton tells @NPR of the arrest of a Chinese tech exec: "I knew in advance. That is something we get from the Justice Department." This means Bolton knew, at least in general terms, of the pending action as he joined Trump and Xi for dinner at G20. @MorningEdition

The cloaked identity of Individual 1 becomes somewhat comical: Michael Cohen's boss... in a Manhattan-based real estate company... a man who apparently had some sort of "campaign" in 2016... whose aide talked of Russia travel "once he becomes the nominee after the convention.”
More about Individual 1: Despite claims to the contrary, "COHEN asked Individual 1 about the possibility of Individual 1 traveling to Russia in connection with the Moscow Project, and asked a senior campaign official about potential business travel to Russia."
In truth, the doc says, "COHEN discussed the status and progress of the Moscow	Project with Individual 1 on more than the three occasions COHEN claimed to the Committee, and he briefed family members of Individual 1 within the Company about the project."
"I never considered asking [Individual 1] to travel to Russia in connection with this proposal.” Another Cohen statement described as a lie in the federal document, which identifies Individual 1 as "the owner" of the "Manhattan-based real estate company" where Cohen was VP.
Cohen worked for "Individual 1," the "owner of the Company." Said "[individual 1] was never in contact with anyone about this project other than me on three occasions." The document says Cohen lied about such things "to minimize links between the Moscow Project and Individual 1."
Cohen also lied, the document says, when he claimed he “did not recall any Russian government response or contact about the Moscow Project.”
“The Moscow Project ended in January 2016 and was not discussed extensively with others in the company.” One of the lies by Michael Cohen described in the court filing: https://t.co/oDmrECv3p7

The long-term US bet on the Saudis might force any administration to limit its response. The main effects of Trump’s statement, then, are to re-center the story on him, and drop “Muslim Brotherhood” and “enemy of the state” on a US resident killed for saying inconvenient things.
Saudi Arabia, says the president, “would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance” to Yemen if only Iran left. Curiously, the Saudis claimed they already were providing assistance.
CIA findings about MBS - not deemed worth passing on. Saudi claims that a journalist was an “enemy of the state” - fine to pass on.
Among other things, the president insists “we may never know” about the Saudi killing of a journalist, then says the US must set aside the crime and collaborate with Saudi Arabia “to eliminate the threat of terrorism throughout the world!” https://t.co/oR4yPnwVSZ

Some who support Abrams’ side aren’t liking the Jackson analogy, presumably because there are so many reasons to dislike Jackson. The point is not that they are the same people but that Abrams act, depending on how she does it, is arguably within the bounds of tradition.
@JeffMcGeorge Thanks - mainly that Jackson also maintained the system was rigged, that the game was unjust, and that he would fight by other means.
It’s also a little in the spirit of Al Gore, who accepted defeat in 2000 but never said it was fair (four years later Gore said: “Let’s make sure that the Supreme Court does not pick the next president, and that this president is not the one who picks the next Supreme Court.”)

Can't add enough about this. In 2000, the partisans were partisan but the president held his fire. As did key Republicans. William Safire wrote that he believed Bush won, but added that once the process played out, Al Gore was a patriot who would honorably concede. It was true.
In 2000, there was no doubt that then-president Bill Clinton was pulling for Al Gore in the Florida recount against George W. Bush. But in public statements he made sure to stay calm, urging Americans not to worry because there was time before the inauguration to reach a result. https://t.co/meiGTVkgiv

Really interesting thread by @AlecMacGillis on Ohio, its politics, and the rural vote. https://t.co/xH3Fddhqs7
Very important thread on the national dish of Indiana https://t.co/iQDfAb12xw
And I will add, @seanmdav, that I should have waited awhile to be more certain it was not on Fox, as many critiques about what the media supposedly are not covering are wrong.
Update: An additional search at 10:34am shows a Fox report on the caravan that is listed as published “1 hour ago” and a Laura Ingraham episode. The point about the Faithful Patriot name change stands. h/t @seanmdav
@seanmdav Thanks, Sean - Another Fox search just now, at 10:34am, shows a story published “1 hour ago,” and also a Laura Ingraham episode titled “Trump’s Midterm Victory,” which presumably includes the caravan. Appreciate your observation.

RT @maggieNYT: Trump is not in control the way he was yesterday. And knows it.
The president is asked about a rise in anti-Semitic attacks in the US: "Why do you think that is? And what do you intend to do?" Changes the subject to his support for Israel. Asked again, he says the US is wealthier than China. Third time: "I think I am a great moral leader."
"If President Obama had this economy...." begins the president who inherited that economy.
“The lesson I’ve learned” from the election, said the president, is “I think people like me.”
Remarkable combination and threats and appeals by the president, urging Democrats to work with him rather than investigate his finances, taxes, and administration. Can't do both, he insists. Talks of using the Senate to investigate anyone who conducts oversight of him.
"I give her a great deal of credit," says the president of Nancy Pelosi. "Hopefully we can all work together."
As he re-imagines the election, saying Republicans won but were treated unfairly and had excuses for their defeat, the president seems somewhat surprisingly lethargic, eyes often downcast as he seems to look at a piece of paper.

“They’ll impose socialism on the state of Florida,” the president warns of Democrats, “and they’ll erase our borders.” (resending with typo corrected.)
Trump calls Florida “a state that I live in, I’m here all the time.” He has spent many days of his presidency at Trump resorts in South Florida.
The president claims without evidence that if “Cryin’ Chuck Schumer” and “the legendary genius Maxine Waters” take change of Congress, they will “double and triple and quadruple your taxes.”
Looking forward to 2020 debates against a Democrat, the president predicts they will be “easy,” but a bit harder because he will face a second opponent, “the media.”
Trump, in Pensacola, promotes last year’s tax cut and says “we will soon follow it up” with the 10% middle class tax cut he abruptly promised in October and previously said would be passed by now.

Listening to many sources and bringing forth many narratives is like a check and balance. Hopefully all the narratives are true, but the variety reduces the danger of a politician pushing a false one. Letting one person set all the narratives is the media equivalent of monarchy.
What the media can do:	-keep a story in perspective	-make sure facts are delivered and false claims wrapped in fact checks 	-Don’t let any one official constantly determine the narrative	-Don’t let any one official constantly lead off the story	-Listen to many sources.
Officials may gain a news benefit with false or extreme claims. Even if they're shown to be dishonest, they get coverage of their chosen topic with a conflict-rich story centered on them. Media can't necessarily just ignore it. Ultimately voters decide if they think this is okay.

@Fisher_DanaR @NatureClimate @PLOSONE @familyunequal @LorienJasny Thanks. With respect, you do not have a critique of sampling.

You made this false statement without any evidence, and told me to find it for you, which I cannot, as it is false.
Yes, this was an interesting and revealing moment, where the voter said he related to the way Trump failed and failed before succeeding. It is true that the president often failed, but first, according to a NYT investigation, he was handed over $400 million in 2018 dollars. https://t.co/MCKVclO7OH
@Fisher_DanaR @NatureClimate @PLOSONE @familyunequal Thanks, agree it's good to reflect. Days ago I was in KY; the voters we aired included Democrats and people left of them. Still, some in your echo chamber repeatedly asked, why only Trump voters? You study echo chambers; you've learned your echo is false. Will you stick with it?
@Fisher_DanaR @NatureClimate @PLOSONE Thanks - Agreed that echo chambers are important; glad you study them. I must add there's an echo chamber of people who repeat the same unsupported comment you made. By asking me to find evidence to support your opinion, you're saying you picked up that opinion without evidence.
@MichaelPWrites Thanks. It's false to say NPR has a "both sides model." We do make an effort to put real questions to everyone and bring you facts. A news organization is your personal intelligence agency: whatever your views, you need it to track those you disagree with, not just your friends.

Hoskin's answer: " It does. I don't begrudge anybody for having family stories or being curious about their DNA, but you have to take Senator Warren's statement in the larger context. She has told stories about being a Cherokee, hearing those stories growing up...." 2/3
Thanks. Nobody? From the interview:		Q. "Let's talk about what Warren said. She specifically said 'I am not enrolled in a tribe.' She says, 'I have native ancestry.'...

There is a generations-old list of Cherokees and you must prove descent from it through birth certificates, etc. if you prove it you can be 1/1000 Cherokee and qualify. They’ve added many in recent years. Other tribes (even  another Cherokee band) have different rules btw. https://t.co/TlGztZZ6w2

One common response, as we talked with voters last week in KY, was that people had opinions on various issues, but many didn’t know much about their congressman or his challenger. Some had met them!

There’s some history to this idea: some 1800’s Americans felt the USA had a mission to spread the word of God to “the heathens.” But the idea wasn’t universal.

@LabChamp Understood. Yet you don’t know anything of the motives of multiple people except that you would have worded a headline differently. When accusing people of misinterpreting facts, it will strengthen your case to stay within the facts yourself, and weaken it not to.
Thanks. Think your interpretation is valid, but differ on the word “intentionally.” No need to assume bad motives of fellow citizens you don’t know. POTUS once praised white supremacists who supported a Lee statue. Naturally some will raise eyebrows when he mentions Lee again. https://t.co/8wLA4XgkPT

Thanks - we should be clear - the KY gentleman who voiced his fear of civil war did not say he was in any mood to start one. He voted for Trump, now feels the US has pulled “up from the bootstraps,” and he’s troubled that so many people disagree so strongly with his view. https://t.co/ra41OeC4Ox
Thanks for asking. Depends on the person. In rural white areas of Kentucky, some residents are irked at white neighbors on disability, Medicaid, or suffering from addiction. But some white voters also bring up people of color, suggest they protest too much. https://t.co/7aO3nMsqUT
But there’s this: in our unscientific talks, we found some conservative voters who back Trump, but also prefer divided government, checks and balances. That implies a plausible, George Will-style vote for Democrats. But only if they override the trends of a polarizing time. END

In 2016 Trump celebrated support from the downscale, “poorly educated.” Now there’s a clearer picture of Trump support in poor rural areas. The poorest people are often D’s or don’t vote. Those a bit better off go for Trump, feeling the poorest take advantage of the system. 3/

@AllenTburgh Thank you. What is the one way that it “always” goes? If it’s against Kavanaugh, why have I linked to defenses? If it’s for, why have I linked to criticisms? And where specifically have I expressed a view? Is it possible the bias is yours?
@AllenTburgh Thanks for following. What, specifically, do you feel the bias is, and where specifically is it expressed? You're responding to a link to an article that is much more about elite school culture than Kavanaugh.

This isn’t an editorial on press freedom, just a fact: I’m a citizen. It’s my right to speak, write, inform, and learn. This right gives citizens power, which I use as best I can, and which I decline to give up. Officials who lash out at our power only show how much they fear it.

@czarped Thanks, what do you feel I am justifying with this book research?
@katekoza Thanks, I didn’t even do the story and have respectfully answered concerns all day. Have acknowledged real criticism and debate. Also called out false accusations. NPR’s media correspondent even criticized the story on NPR. All these things are true. Why do you say the opposite?
More Frederick Douglass: Before the Civil War his newspaper regularly reprinted pro-slavery resolutions from Southern lawmakers, in full. He believed each statement fired up righteous resistance in the North. He introduced one with the words, "Here is another rabid specimen."
The notes on an 1848 anti-slavery meeting including Frederick Douglass end this way: “Three cheers for liberty were proposed and heartily given... We trust each member resolved to do what in him lay for the downfall of tyranny in this otherwise happy republic.”

This was @davidfolkenflik’s case today. That while he had criticisms of the approach, a journalist does interview people, no matter how awful. The ones you think are awful may be the ones you most need to keep track of. https://t.co/2p9jSIky6g
2/2 You feel there should be an expert on to counter Murray. Okay... Unless, of course, that "legitimizes" Murray by going on at length about him with on-the-one-hand-on-the-other-hand stuff. It's a valid debate how to handle this. Why not join that debate using facts? Allbest
Thanks. You're right, saying Murray's name wouldn't be enough. In the transcript, @noelking says he's known for "The Bell Curve," which "questioned the IQ and genetics" of non-whites and is "debunked by scientists and sociologists... any scientist that is not Charles Murray." 1/2 https://t.co/Ky7m5D20Cu
Thanks for this suggestion— it’s often a useful approach that is used at NPR, including in the interview at issue here, which, among other things, stopped playing at one point while @NoelKing added an explanation of discredited science. https://t.co/GjNmxH6wYg
@lesliemolson Thanks. What I know is that he was constantly questioned refuted, that context was added, that the necessary information was in the interview. I’ve heard no one say, “Wow, he sounded truthful.” People say they heard a racist. Was he persuasive to you?
Thanks, I’ve had that thought. But race, racism and identity are vast themes in politics. Of thousands of people we interview, some will spout racism and non-facts. The question becomes how best to accurately report on them. Nobody who heard this interview could doubt who he is. https://t.co/HXEO67tOhX
Nearly simultaneous tweets: the interview was too short and too long.  Doesn’t mean either is wrong! Both wrestle with the challenge of how to report on racists; both are more useful than the original false claims about this interview. (“No pushback, white people did it,” etc). https://t.co/nSF6hiYk4m
@Frymanl Thanks. Agree with this approach 100%. So let's examine what listeners say they heard. They say they heard a racist. Few could have any doubt of his fact-free views. He was fairly, rigorously presented with lots of context for those who needed it. Did you feel he was persuasive?
@toner564 Thanks. The transcript of the interview shows your claim to be false. He was refuted on all relevant points. The "science" he quoted shown to be debunked. The pre-recorded interview was even stopped for a section on this by the host. The re-examination shows this too.
@LinniMay @davidfolkenflik Thanks. You have before you the interview and Folkenflik's examination, which show your claims to be false. "No researched push back." False. "Given a platform." No, he was rigorously interviewed.  Etc. If your argument is strong, you should be able to to make it with facts.
It's legitimate to question bias in structures and systems, even when they're diverse. But many people didn't do that. They falsely assumed white people did this interview, and pontificated on their vile motives. If your argument is good, you should be able to make it with facts.
Thanks. Agreed, a diverse staff's decisions aren't automatically right. But people made a much-publicized false claim that oblivious white people did this interview. @davidfolkenflik fact-checked: the host, key execs were people of color. Didn't "use the fact." He told the truth. https://t.co/FaPToEixYj

There were titanic fights over race and national identity. Immigrants were targeted. Nativists rose to power. Slave interests vowed to wreck the country rather than risk defeat. Yet antislavery activists—many women—saw opportunity in the chaos to stand for the right, and did. 6/x
These acts of “manifest destiny” literally shaped the United States, and triggered immense debates: should slavery be allowed in the new lands? Faced with this great moral question, politicians opted for extreme tactics, and a divided nation began to slide toward civil war. 5/x
In 1845 John Frémont rode into Mexican-controlled California with 60 gunmen. Had no permission to be there, was an illegal border-crosser. He began the process of seizing it, part of the 1840’s conquest that created the southwestern border that the United States guards now. 4/x
The book is the story of the Western explorer John C. Frémont and his wife, Jessie Benton Frémont. He made maps of the American West – then became extraordinarily famous by penning best-selling accounts of his adventures, which she helped him to write. 3/x
It is hard, hard, hard to turn away from the news even for a moment, but gives priceless perspective. The story takes place in the 1840’s and 1850’s. In the Library of Congress and elsewhere, I’m finding earlier versions of many of the debates we face today. 2/x

The governing detailed @byJoeHernandez contrasts with the Brexit report. Who knows, bail abolition may fail. But it seems lawmakers saw a real issue and tried a practical solution. It's been going since Jan. 2017, almost as long as Britain has debated Brexit with no result. END
Overall, the report says, New Jersey's prison population is dropping. Nationwide, there's a widespread bipartisan view that too many people are in prison, at too much cost and with ill effects on society; abolition of bail seems to address that. 4/x

An added note. US officials have been aware how vague NK’s commitments have been, and view this period as a test: is NK serious?  Pompeo’s statement maintains hope the answer can be Yes. NK’s statement expresses surprise that the US is even posing the question.
Pompeo, however, again says NK went farther than NK says. "We talked about...achieving what Chairman Kim and President Trump both agreed to, which is the complete denuclearization of North Korea.” Again, NK didn’t commit to this: not to denuclearization, nor to NK alone. END
NK insists they expected different demands - “measures conducive to building trust.” NK offers a totally different picture of the talks than the US does. The US wants swift, total denuclearization. NK wants a process of gradual steps, which in the past have led nowhere. 5/x
The North Koreans expressed shock and dismay at Pompeo’s “robber-like” demands, even though Pompeo may have asked no more than what he said NK already agreed to at the summit. Of course the communique shows they hadn’t quite agreed to that at the summit. 4/x
At this latest meeting, according to NK, Pompeo really did make demands along the lines of verifiable denuclearization. It’s reasonable to think this is true. Pompeo thinks the talks were productive. Yet NK said absolutely the opposite. 3/x
The summit communique promised to “work toward” denuclearization of “the Korean Peninsula.” No commitment to denuclearize, no verification. Yet Pompeo insisted to reporters verification was in there. Surely he meant it’s implied. But just as surely, NK didn’t want it in. 2/x

Having defeated the No. 4 House Republican, does @Ocasio2018 hope to keep or replace the top House Democrat, Nancy Pelosi? "It depends on our options... I think it would be inappropriate to commit to any one individual before we've even won the House in November." @MorningEdition
Do Democrats run a risk by seeming too extreme in opposition to Trump, such as calling for impeachment or shunning public officials? @Ocasio2018  "No. I don't think so. You look at the extremity of this current administration," fierce opposition is "not extreme, it is clarity."
Asked if R's can take advantage of her call to abolish ICE by saying Democrats favor "open borders," @Ocasio2018: "I refuse to answer to these false characterizations," says she wants to "re-imagine" border security that's been  "militarized" and "criminalized." @MorningEdition
On her call to "abolish ICE," @Ocasio2018 says: "ICE was established in 2003," the era of the Patriot Act, and was "built on a scaffolding of questionable civil liberties infringement and abuse. What we’re talking about is re-imagining immigration to be humane." @MorningEdition

That's an implication of Roberts' opinion, as I read him: If Congress doesn't want one person to have such power they shouldn't give it to him. Sotomayor reads the opposite: that the president's national security claim was obvious fiction and he violated other legal prohibitions. https://t.co/jjFmJ69Op9
@jmwilkins365 @UpFirst @RepBillJohnson Also, as a native of neighboring Indiana, I am a big fan of all things Ohio except for wanting Ohio State to lose to Indiana teams in all sports at all times.
@jmwilkins365 @UpFirst @RepBillJohnson Thanks, I understand why you say this but respectfully disagree. The ruling had just been announced; @repbilljohnson graciously took our questions before anyone could have read it all; it was still good to hear him because he was familiar with issues debated the past 1 1/2 years.
Where Congress specifically delegated him such authority, Roberts says yes. On p. 12 he cites a Bill Clinton order barring Sudanese officials; it was a single sentence. He says Trump, after 2 failed attempts, did a bit more than the minimum with the 3rd, ordering a gov't review. https://t.co/6j5cHr9MFz

“Breyer thought it essential to ask: Are exemptions and waivers being given to people who do not pose a national security threat?... People requiring medical treatment, academic visitors, students, family members, children, haven’t been getting waivers.”	 https://t.co/u3zU9N62ce
Distinguishing “what the president said” from “what the president did” - our special ⁦@UpFirst⁩ on the Supreme Court travel ban ruling with colleagues ⁦@NoelKing⁩ and ⁦@HorsleyScott⁩: https://t.co/0OXvqZmou8
Still thinking of Roberts p. 28-29, quoting presidents from Washington (US gives "bigotry no sanction") to Eisenhower ("America will fight with her whole strength" for Muslim right to worship) to GW Bush (telling Muslims "we share the same values.")
Roberts also takes the precaution of declaring the Court ruling that upheld Japanese-American internment "gravely wrong" and unconstitutional. As if to preempt the possibility that some president who favors the 1944 ruling might use it to justify his next national security moves.
Accused of ruling as the Court infamously did in 1944, Justice Roberts says the cases are different. Japanese-American internment was different than denying "certain foreign nationals the privilege of admission."
Sotomayor notes that President Trump himself, as a candidate, compared his Muslim travel ban to Japanese internment, saying on TV that Franklin D. Roosevelt "did the same thing."
Sotomayor notes that, just as the court upheld Japanese internment in World War Two, the court allowed the government to invoke "an ill-defined "national security	threat to justify an exclusionary policy of sweeping proportion."
In dissent, Sotomayor says Roberts' opinion "does not even tell half the story...The full record paints a far more harrowing picture, from which a reasonable observer would readily conclude that the Proclamation was motivated by hostility	and animus toward the Muslim faith."
In a remarkable passage, Roberts notes POTUS has "extraordinary	power" to speak on America's behalf. He lists past presidents who spoke up for American "principles of religious freedom and tolerance." But then he notes that many presidents have followed these words "unevenly."
Roberts notes the plaintiffs say the policy "does little to serve national security interests. But we cannot substitute our own assessment for the Executive’s predictive judgments on such matters." We circle back to the president's authority to decide national security matters.
Roberts writes (p.33) the court might overturn an act if it lacks "any purpose other than a 'bare . . .desire to harm a politically unpopular group.'" Does the travel ban have any other purpose? Roberts notes the president said it was for national security.
Challenges to the law said the president's national security power was limited by a different law, stating "no person shall . . . be discriminated against" for a visa due to "race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.” Roberts writes that doesn't apply here.
This is important to note, and it's true of many laws: Congress, especially from the Cold War onward, has given the president broad authority to decide a variety of national security matters, up to and including the destruction of the planet.
Justice Roberts, on p. 13 of his decision, says the president is not required to prove that his travel ban is a useful security measure or that it makes any sense. The law gave the president broad authority to do what he says is best for national security. https://t.co/EgAWkXqqMq

“Dad! Wait up!” a kid says, and I say, “Don’t worry, I’ll never leave you behind,” and then suddenly, without warning, I’m all choked up.
@oligopistos @BrianKarem You’re right, wasn’t necessarily conciliatory - pummeled his enemies (“I welcome their hatred”!!) But also picked majority positions and held off on key moves for years; delayed big things believing they needed support to work at all.
@Wallacewriter That is described as the dark side of the same trait. He admitted as many Jews as he thought he could get away with politically, but turned aside appeals to save more.
FDR bio by Robert Dallek shows FDR working to gain majority public support for his acts. He might wait years to act until he had it. Of course he also waged bitter battles - but knew in the 1930’s democracy itself was being tested. So he played to the majority, not just his base.

@open_mix @DougSaunders Thanks for the counter-argument, appreciate seeing.
A big theme of American thought is the dignity of the individual. Migrants and asylum seekers challenge us: Do we see them as a mass of non-citizens who aren't in our group? Or individuals with varying stories, varying claims to enter the US legally, and a basic right to decency?
Here @DougSaunders marshals stats to argue the migration "crisis" doesn't exist. Migration from Mexico is "a small fraction" of the past; the only real rise is in asylum seekers from violence-torn Central America, who "are not illegal and...not dangerous." https://t.co/j3dThNmxgx
