Factory audio systems in cars were once, at best, an AM-FM radio with a cassette player and a couple of speakers crammed into leftover dashboard space. Today, solid midpriced car audio systems pack a dozen speakers. https://t.co/4Ow4WpKsKG

Facebook is promoting its suicide screening program as a good news story. But some doctors say the company is essentially practicing medicine without a license. https://t.co/6Z0dNaF77S
When entertainment executives of the late 1940s and early '50s went in search of programming, they found it in radio shows like “The Lone Ranger.”  Netflix, Amazon and Apple are doing the same. As @jackiepeiser writes, these days, that means podcasts. https://t.co/DRF6rEJRtq
Our @ronlieber writes that Wells Fargo is not alone among big banks in its lack of specificity in its relief offers to unpaid federal workers. But it should be doing so much more, given its stated desire to make amends for bad behavior. Here's why: https://t.co/lWl6KBp2dx

The automaker said it was cutting prices of all models by $2,000, in part to absorb the reduction of a federal tax credit for Tesla buyers. But it could also signal that Tesla is trying to insulate itself against softer demand. https://t.co/72HuRUXzLB

CNBC  calculated in 2016 that bear markets since World War II began on average about eight months before a recession. That means that if a bear market did begin after major indexes peaked last fall, a recession might not start until June or even later. https://t.co/OlUMFyE0PH
The cost difference is notable: In China, an iPhone XR starts at around $950, while Huawei’s top-end handsets start at about $600, and Xiaomi’s comparable models start at even less. The iPhone XS starts at around $1,250, our @zhonggg notes. https://t.co/AwBW40h8BI
So why wasn’t it obvious to Wells Fargo that it should be first and most generous in this extremely public showdown, which has caught about 800,000 blameless federal workers in the middle? Credit unions managed to figure it out quite quickly. https://t.co/OnxkYtwP0F

Banks are rarely cuddly, but there is no close reading of the government shutdown assistance page on Wells Fargo’s site that doesn’t feel conditional, lawyered and a wee bit stingy given its recent history, our columnist writes https://t.co/gyncQu4tHh
“We have this false, preconceived idea that Chinese brands are not as good, that their products are of cheap quality,” a banker in northern France said. “But the price gap leavens the fears. For 150 euros” — around $170 — “what do you risk anyway?” https://t.co/sDUSWMkEMI

Even the most luxurious car cabin is a torture chamber for sound systems. While the carmakers and the audio teams must battle over environment, budget, weight and space, owners simply want their vehicle to sound as if Ariana Grande were riding shotgun. https://t.co/o4B1od1d34
