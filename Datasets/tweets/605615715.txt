Beautiful evening and awesome dinner with Amie Spano and our son, Isaiah, back home in Florida. There’s no place like home. https://t.co/TnmBje5hSI
Had an opportunity to meet with a dynamic group of military veterans this morning.  Planning ways we can help and support veterans and active duty military personnel.  Love and appreciate these guys! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 #Veterans #FL15 https://t.co/9lJSIeKeYd
Thank you for visiting my campaign Twitter page. If your intention was to visit my official House of Representatives page, please visit &gt;&gt;&gt; @RepRossSpano.

@MattMcKeithan Happy you’re on the team! 🇺🇸
@IrreverentView @MarcACaputo @DavidJollyFL Enjoyed it Chris! Thanks for having me.
@Thelightsareon1 This is an absolute fraud piece. It’s an intentional and inaccurate misrepresentation of my position on these issues. These folks never even reached out to me to ask my position.
It’s “crunch time,” and we’re “running through the tape.”  Working hard to deliver strong, conservative, effective leadership to Congressional District 15! Join us if you can. #PeopleOverPolitics #FreedomPlease #FL15 #FlaPol 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 https://t.co/KFSQHevPOi

@HvinAMorganMomt @CivilGunOwner It certainly seems your (of course not mine) opinion means something to you, or you wouldn’t have waisted all this time trying to convince me you’re right.
@HvinAMorganMomt State lawmakers can, have, and will continue to chip away at the 2nd A if allowed. Our point of contention was not whether it exists (for now), but the extent to which freedom loving Americans will permit their rights to be eroded by those who do not think it should exists.
@HvinAMorganMomt No, the initial conversation was about my unashamed support of the 2nd A.  You responded by saying I was acting like the 2nd A is under attack, which it surely is.  You then asserted there’s nothing lawmakers can do to threaten it, and I called BS.  They certainly can.
@HvinAMorganMomt @JViscoNJ That’s absolutely wrong.  State lawmakers can pass laws significantly limiting the 2nd Amendment, see NY, CA, IL, MD, MA.
@HvinAMorganMomt @JViscoNJ I currently serve in the Florida House of Representatives.  During this year’s Session, during a long debate on a gun bill, two elected Democrats argued that the 2nd Amendment is past its time and no longer necessary.
It’s hard to imagine what it’s like for police officers and their families who face the constant realization of danger that exists when they go on the beat each day. My thoughts and prayers are with the Ft Myers officer who was shot last night.  https://t.co/wnDCc5arzI
Great group of fine Americans learning how to responsibly handle and carry firearms to defend themselves and their families. #2A ##Selfdefense #BillofRights https://t.co/6PgXfpuarQ
@HvinAMorganMomt The SCOTUS has held that the 2nd Amendment includes the right to self defense. Sadly, killers strike most often where guns aren’t permitted.
Unashamed to support the 2nd Amendment and the right to self defense.  By the way, nearly 60% of the RSVPs are women.  https://t.co/lqkc6stUKP
