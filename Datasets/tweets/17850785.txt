@stefanpalios @PulseBlueprint @ManageFlitter well then you would expect to see a similar number of large thumb incidents on links in emails, too. yet chat is 10x higher CTR than email. #socialROI
RT @ManageFlitter: Thank you to our guest @larrykim for sharing excellent insights in today's #SocialROI chat! ^Madalyn https://t.co/SwsbpH…
@charumisra @ManageFlitter A7 #socialROI - check out our guide to chat marketing: https://t.co/eJQb2GfuIf
@ManageFlitter #socialROI oops that was supposed to be A7
@ManageFlitter #SocialROI a6 -- you can build chatbots, facebook messenger ads, drip campaigns and more using my product, MobileMonkey - Free!! https://t.co/LvFgxKWhqG
@SmartestNk @ManageFlitter #socialROI A6. I'm not a stock analyst but i believe the future of FB is strong.
@ManageFlitter #SocialROI A6. messaging it's the future of facebook. increasingly fewer and fewer fb users are interesting in posting crap on a wall for all to see. Stories and private Messaging is the future!
@PulseBlueprint @ManageFlitter A4: #socialroi if messaging is so annoying, why are the click rates so damn high? sure you could maybe trick someone into reading a message via push notification... but then why would they click on the link in the message? (hint: People LOVE messaging!)
@ManageFlitter A5. #socialROI "wechat" equivalent doesn't exist in west due to Messenger fragmentation (google, apple, messenger, whatsapp, instagram, etc) which is being fixed now thanks to #InstaWhatEnger !
@ManageFlitter A5. #socialROI since everyone uses wechat in china (100% market share) they can build all sorts of business services, like ordering lunch, or calling an uber, directly via chat. There is no "news feed"! (1/2)
@aiaddysonzhang @ManageFlitter #socialROI i think maybe the next 5 years, 30-40% of companies will be using messaging like how they use email today (currently around 1% of companies use messaging..)
@ManageFlitter A4: #socialROI Comparing email vs. Chat basically like comparing Donkey vs. Unicorn... https://t.co/CZ5R2IQRCj
@ManageFlitter A4: #socialROI - check out my Messaging blast campaigns vs. email blast campaigns (for the same blog content). Messaging &gt;&gt; Email.. https://t.co/zQqDuBP2zl
@ManageFlitter A4: #socialROI YES. Messaging &gt; Email. (email is the enemy... so awful). see exhibit A here: https://t.co/bUDLPWjmu9
@aiaddysonzhang @ManageFlitter A2: in messaging (unlike email) there is an expectation of a more immediate response #socialROI
@ManageFlitter A3: #socialROI i think the channel will become 10x more valuable as you can reach +3x the number of people, with 1/3rd the effort (build one chatbot for all of facebook users, instead of 3 - one for each messaging platform)
@YoursTrulyCaro @ManageFlitter #a2 yes - targeting ads/messaging based on "converstional criteria" not just inferred interests based on browsing or whatever. #socialROI
@ManageFlitter a2 #socialROI  comparing old and new way to do lead generation (capturing emails vs. messaging permissions) https://t.co/ZrjZKBZRCd
@ManageFlitter A2: #socialROI - also need to invest in chat-based lead generation strategies, like Click to Messenger Ads, and these other ways to generate opt-ins, like these ways: https://t.co/JSaBPNJa7X
@ManageFlitter A2: #socialROI - Companies will need to take messaging seriously as a new marketing channel. They'll need to adapt by building messaging infrastructure (chatbots - essentially like chat-based web pages).
@ManageFlitter A1: #socialroi - nobody on instagram ever wanted to message someone on whatsapp. #InstaWhatEnger is totally for the benefits of businesses seeking to market to that enormous user community (and for the benefit of FB profits!)
@PulseBlueprint @GenePetrovLMC @ManageFlitter #socialROI i think that chat will be encrypted for user-to-user communications but not for user-to-business communications #A1 (since many customer service people at a company can respond to those messages)
@ManageFlitter A1: #SocialROI Reason #3 is WECHAT. People in China use messaging much like how we use "browsers" in the west. A unified messaging platform would allow companies to build out ecommerce experiences, via messaging - $$$ for FB https://t.co/893K9f0a1j
@ManageFlitter A1: #SocialROI Reason #2 is SCALE. Integrating #InstaWhatEnger = over 3 billion daily active users. That is a dream for marketers! better than email! https://t.co/893K9f0a1j
@ManageFlitter A1: #SocialROI Reason #1 is chatbots. to make it so businesses can connect with these 3 billion users regardless of what messaging app is being used! https://t.co/893K9f0a1j

🤔How much time do you spend on social media? 	Research says 142 minutes per day https://t.co/F9ccmZ4RbS
@elizavetaka Oh that was one huge change. Last week we moved into a new place and baby got a separate room. I think we were waking him up half the time!
@cfus89 First full night sleep since May 2018. 😅
@Mflower555 My 4 year old makes us read books forever as a way to avoid bed time 😂
@eneskartall Couple of ideas: we bought a really soft fuzzy blanket that he seems to love. The other thing that may have helped is transitioning from milk/formula to solid food (Gerber baby food, etc), which I think helps him not get as hungry at night. Good luck with your little one!!
@ArtursW Sleep deprivation causes memory issues. Scientists theorize that the purpose of sleep is to rest your brain, transferring short term memory into long term memories. So a lack of sleep could explain why you don’t remember stuff from that time.
@elizavetaka My 4 year old had big sleep issues until age 3. Everyone has their own schedule ☺️
