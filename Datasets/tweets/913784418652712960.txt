After almost 30 years of fighting depression I am with you front and center.  I'm well today at 60 but lost 30 years because of it,  it being stigma with issues &amp; questions never asked by professionals that I found answers to by doing a little research on myself. https://t.co/PQL6KSugZy

NO.. It is absolutely not because it's still social media and could lead to more isolating which always comes with depression.

People who have an illness get very good at hiding it because still in 2018 most are ashamed to admit their heart hurts. However, if you have physical heart pain you fly to a cardiologist or ER.

@Fawcett_Matt Social skills, less social media. 	Self-control &amp; self discipline.
This was the only place to sit anywhere. Sat and watched an all white seagull fly in front of me as I stared at the ocean and sky. I looked down and saw a white stone in all the grey and picked it up. For 16 years my dads death has haunted me. We found him on his kitchen floor.
I read it twice. Thing is reading is hard because of ADHD that I can't treat. I then heard the song He Saw Jesus. One day I was walking on the beach in Hull, MA. Listening and singing the song, very beautiful song..	I stopped and sat on a huge piece of driftwood.
Maria Stephanos from WCVB in Boston posted a photo of a stone on a beach in the shape of a heart. Quote said "always look down" Earlier this year I watched KLG talk about her trip to Jeruselem with Frank. He found a stone and it all changed his spiritual life. I bought the book.

The problem being this presidential mormon has no morals...clearly. https://t.co/DjwJMwesUd
Trump knows everything so I bet he thinks he knows where all these children are, these tiny human beings. This is almost barbaric.😢 https://t.co/EPjU3XTr0Z
This is so not ok...as much as that moron says they're being fed and cared for, my life that they are not..Who's feeding their heart and soul and caring for their emotional well being. Truly heartbreaking 💔 https://t.co/RoVF72Ryef
Isn't that called blackmail. https://t.co/H1g1jABvsV
Of course it does, who could possibly think otherwise. This administration doesn't give a damn...Claiming these poor kids are being treated well....they get meals, able to speak with parent. Sure, we can't even keep our children all fed in this country. https://t.co/Zb2z9qOT7I
This is one problem...I'm 60 &amp; diagnosed with ADHD at 40. Hospital at 15  3 months.	Recently got all mental health records...Chances are not depressed. Why medications didn't work, 40+ of them.

@KathieLGifford At that moment I knew my dad Saw Jesus that night in 2004. Not only that but I know that my father was standing beside Jesus following me on the beach that day. God Bless You⚘
@KathieLGifford I sat on the only spot there, a large piece of driftwood. Put head phones on to listen to hymns on my playlist. The very 1st song was yours, the next was Eagles Wings which was sung at my father's funeral. A lone white seagull flew in circles in front of me over the water.
@KathieLGifford In your book you speak of the stone in Jerusalem and how it changed Frank's life. I live on a rocky beach, the stones all grey/ slate color. 2 miles into the walk I looked down and saw a stone that is beige marble amongst all the grey. I needed to sit down because of crying.
@KathieLGifford Since hearing your song everything shifted in my life. I sing it to myself all the time. Every word just fills me with an incredible love. Because of you &amp; a little 5 year old friend of mine, not only have I returned to my faith.
@KathieLGifford You sang He Saw Jesus on Today and I felt my soul come out of the darkness and fill with a beautiful light. The song is one that I could sing verbatim today remembering the night I found my father on my kitchen floor. Since that night in 2004 the memory has haunted.
@KathieLGifford At night before bed I read bible quotes from little books that are simple to understand. I love that you tweet you're own⚘	I felt and saw Jesus in you so clearly after Frank passed away it's almost chilling. I began going to Mass again after a forty year absence.Thankyou💞

This is absolutely true. However we all need to fight today for the generation of children now in kindergarten because the world, this country is for sure going to let them down.

Totally agree!!! But, what is government doing to stop the guns getting into schools. Every time I here a debate on news shows about Rosanne I want to throw a shoe through the TV. There has never been this kind of debate about any school shooting. I am so angry.😡 https://t.co/pAxQxDQo5t
