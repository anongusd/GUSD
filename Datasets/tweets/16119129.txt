Senate GOP plan to fund #ExecutiveAmnesty is a mistake. Senators swore an oath to defend Constitution.
There's nothing ‚Äúclean" about a bill that funds Obama's illegal #ExecutiveAmnesty
As expected, @McConnellPress has joined @SenatorReid in supporting funding for Obama's illegal #ExecutiveAmnesty program.
Last year‚Äôs ‚Äúcromnibus" plan was designed to fail. @McConnellPress always planned to cave on #ExecutiveAmnesty
.@McConnellPress never pressured Democrats on amnesty. No united message, no weekend sessions, and a long relaxing recess.
Senate GOP leaders surrender again ‚Ä¶ plan to fund Obama's amnesty for the rest of the fiscal year.
.@JohnCornyn, court rulings get overturned every day. It is that simple. No more excuses. Keep your word. #DefundAmnesty
The Texas court decision isn‚Äôt a reason for Senate Republicans to cave on amnesty; it‚Äôs a reason for them to hold strong.
.@McConnellPress will try to muddy the waters with a drive-by vote against executive amnesty before he surrenders.
The upcoming vote on executive amnesty is a cover vote designed to let Senate Rs oppose the policy before they fund it.

Remember, @SpeakerBoehner told the president to "do what you gotta do" on amnesty. http://t.co/hor7iqA5V6
.@SpeakerBoehner does not really support the House DHS anti-amnesty bill. He‚Äôs rooting for it to fail.
Instead of undermining @SenatorSessions &amp; @SenTedCruz, @SpeakerBoehner should make it clear that the House won‚Äôt fund amnesty.
Democrats know GOP leadership will cave on amnesty funding. That has to change before Democrats will support the DHS bill.
Before Democrats will support a DHS bill that stops amnesty, GOP leaders have to convince them that they won't surrender.
.@SenatorReid Wrong. You should pass a DHS bill that supports and defends the Constitution. That‚Äôs the oath you swore.
.@clairecmc isn‚Äôt worried about DHS's anti-terrorism funding; she just wants to fund Obama‚Äôs amnesty.
.@clairecmc says she's worried about DHS's ability to stop terrorists, but she didn't mind tying TSA's hands with collective bargaining.
Democrats say they want a ‚Äúclean‚Äù DHS bill, but there‚Äôs nothing clean about letting Obama use taxpayer money to break the law.
Senate Democrats should be forced to do a real, talking filibuster if they want to fund the president‚Äôs unlawful amnesty.
Democrats don‚Äôt care if spending bills are clean; they just want them to fund their liberal priorities.
Democrats supported a policy rider to stop OCS oil and gas drilling, but they won‚Äôt support one that stops unlawful amnesty.
Democrats are fine with using spending bills to pass liberal riders; they just don‚Äôt want to use them to pass conservative riders.

GOP senators who don‚Äôt want a vote to defund amnesty: McConnell, Hatch, Blunt, Collins, Hoeven, Isakson, Shelby, Flake
Senate RINOs have a simple end game strategy on every debate: surrender.

Q. What is @Team_Mitch's strategy to defund amnesty? A. He doesn‚Äôt have one.
If the Democrats wanted to avoid a weekend session, they should have allowed a simple vote to defund amnesty.
Why isn't @Team_Mitch fighting for a vote to defund amnesty? Too busy trying to score another win for President Obama? #DefundObamasAmnesty
