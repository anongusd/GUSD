@libbycwatson Then we agree, but on different premises. Journalists all lament the shrink of local news, but nothing's that simple. It's taken a decade for owners to figure (still figuring) out how to generate and sustain digital-era revenue, and the public's needs are so different. Hopeful!
@Mrele11 @libbycwatson Of course there is. And it would be wonderful to have reporters covering all of those things in Florida - so, where did I say I didn't want that? I didn't.
@libbycwatson Where did I advocate for media concentration?
@libbycwatson Just disagree it's inherently bad that "media" has so many jobs to offer in Washington, where newsrooms are expanding greatly and thankfully after years of decline. I would think we'd want more of all kinds, big markets and small. But that requires revenue and readers.
I hate hearing about media layoffs, too, but also regret seeing journos react with such a sense that professional journalism is an American entitlement. It's necessary. But it's still a business. And it's not easy. Something I learned to appreciate much more as executive editor.
It's "media"'s fault the US gov is headquartered in Washington?

Brilliant observation by @jrezaian, who says he realizes he writes for one of the biggest papers in the country, the paper of record of the national capital, with the full knowledge and blessing of the government. That means something. @washingtonpost @PostBaron
Jason says last night an Iranian couple approached him at NY event to say they haven't been back to Tehran since Feb 10, 1979. "I'm also hopeful that, at some point, I will go back to Iran" - @jrezaian, but not til a lot of people leave power. "I'm not going anywhere."
"Ultimately it's the regime that has the guns and tanks and control over the infrastructure"...and the infrastructure actually works, breaking that up and taking control by new forces "is not going to be an easy task." @jrezaian
Ignatius asks if Iran really is in some pre-revolutionary state, as leaders warn. @jrezaian says prolonged protests are real, and what's new is that it's about economic issues, not just rights, population very educated, women, etc..
"I think it was a little bit irresponsible for us to leave (the Iran deal) at the time that we did" because people wont believe US worth their ink. "It was not designed" for all these other things, just to stop nuke progress "and we stopped that" could've built on it - @jrezaian
"We just hear what we want to hear" - @jrezaian says news audiences too polarized, answering audience q.
.@IgnatiusPost asks about "Iranian moderates" ..are there moderates in the leadership?	@jrezaian: We should "start tossing aside" notions of hard line and moderates...describes more complex picture, "you can't lead a completely shut off...state, in 2019. It's not possible."
The IRGC did not want nuke talks, they opposed Rouhani gov't. "My arrest was one of many attempts by the IRGC to scuttle that deal." - @jrezaian #Iran
Iranian interrogators accused @jrezaian, he says, of being tied to everything from CIA to Mi6 to "the international feminist movement" - crowd laughs - "I mean, seriously!"

Jason: Our view of #Iran was trapped in 1979 "my goal was to get you to imagine a world beyond what you thought you could imagine" or what the authorities said "...and I thought I did that" which is sad irony.
"I wanted to go there and write about a place that I thought I could make more accessible to readers of the Washington Post." - @jrezaian #Iran
David: Why go to places like this?	Jason: "Don't you want to read the newspaper everyday? ...Don't you want to know what's going on in the world? If we don't put ourselves in those places" you won't know.

Presidents, PMs, and cabinet members have global influence and can move markets and spread ideas with one good speech and serious meetings. It's a pretty venue but so what, it's still work. Global media broadcasting live. And it happens with or without American leaders' voices.
Personally, I hate boring cheap shots at world leaders for their world travel. I'd prefer American leaders that are global leaders. Cynical cheap shots at #Davos as a time-waste boondoggle sound to me exactly like the shots at the Pelosi codel for going to a war zone.
So Trump, May, and Macron stayed home from Davos to fix/attend/pay lip service to domestic political moments. But isn't there an argument for world leaders to do.... both? Isn't leading the world stage also leading for one's country? 60 other world leaders are scheduled.

Arguably hurts US security, US partner security, trust, and betrays every fighter sent there over the last five years to do the job Trump now says wasn‚Äôt worth it and isn‚Äôt worth finishing. What exactly will Trump‚Äôs #Syria withdrawal look like, Secretary Mattis and Gen Dunford?
Right when the US has found strong, democratic partners who need everything the world asked of them and need civilian help and a little security. Trump is cutting and running for no political benefit there, or here.
But here‚Äôs what Trump does not understand, or is lying about: Locals did fight for themselves, proudly and through enormous casualties, with US help, on the cheap. ‚ÄúBy with through‚Äù was finally working, commanders argue.
Trump‚Äôs tweets betray him. First he told us ISIS was defeated, that‚Äôs why US troops should leave. Now he says it‚Äôs not worth the money, or the fight. And he says Washington‚Äôs enemies will fight for us. He is abandoning Mideast partners, and whatever leverage US has left.

"It's the dog that doesn't bark." -- Amb. Jeffrey says, of ... actually i'm not sure what he was talking about but its a funny saying.
Q on China's global expansions &amp; Syria. Jeffrey: all China's global expansion is "real and worrisome...but it is also prudent and cautious," says Jeffrey. The Chinese often diverge from the Russians, on UNSC Syria votes, for various reasons. "I don't quite know what it is."
"Nobody knows how to do this" Jeffrey says of Syria post-fight "stabilization ops" of any name, anywhere. "Only partially successful" in Iraq, w constitution, voting. Trump "has decided it's somebody else's job to provide stabilization funding...we could always use more money."
US Ambassador Jeffrey says Iran forces needs to leave #Syria: "We see no reason to tolerate this." Their military presence so near Israel is an "extremely dangerous situation that they introduce... it's our position that they need to go."
What's the future for US support of the SDF? Jeffrey says historically "we don't have permanent relationships with sub-state entities...it's simply not something we do." Says solution is reform of the Syrian gov and a permanent ceasefire. #Syria
Jeffrey diplomatically walks the line, says US is there for Turkey's security but also to get the job done in #Syria, I missed the exact quote.
First question thankfully to a reporter, @DionNissenbaum, who asks what's being down to stop Turkey from invading #Syria. "We'll have to wait and see. I believe the situation has calmed somewhat...we're willing to work on the ground."
How complicated is Syria? In Geneva, Assad's opposition is presenting a list of potential ministers to De Mistura be approved that it meets UN criteria for a legit oppo group. "not there yet" https://t.co/NJHP1LxYuq
"It is relatively peaceful" in #Syria, right now, Jeffrey says (again). US hopes this is a window for peace. US wants: de-escalation of violence, humanitarian access, convene to write a new constitution and new elections.
When Amb. Jeffrey speaks any Arabic, does the Boston accent still shine through? Hope so.
US Ambassador Jim Jeffrey is on a string of recent public appearances trying to education the public on #Syria. To catch up, start with his excellent interview with @CNN's @EliseLabott at the @DefenseOne Summit, in November.  https://t.co/o43aRq2R3p

The war -- and US-Saudi performance in it -- deserves every word of scrutiny. But as much as #KhashoggiMurder has drawn a wave of Tuesday morning quarterbacks to Yemen, those same pundits often are just letting Iran off the hook. Starving babies? Where's the outrage at Tehran?
Yemen is a complex, years-old regional war w clear US interests. US operators have saved lives there, too. US leaders need to explain and own it - especially at the WH. But American pundits dipping in for short-term, shallow takes often reveal no clue abt security or human rghts.

Gen. Milley is close to the ground wars on terrorism, he understands politics and public appetites, but has patience for today's long-term wars (much written about that), consumes war history and knows the Army's limits. Will be interesting.
With Milley, expect a continuation of the Mattis-Dunford method of executing the president's commands (like em or not) and little big changes for things like Afghanistan, GWOT, force sizes.
The conversation is off the record at social events, of course, but we'll have more on what to expect from a Chairman Milley.

@NickKristof My hope is one day all of our publications will make business and editorial decisions that value and invest in field reporting on America‚Äôs global leadership as much as they do inexpensive commentary on it.
@NickKristof The Yemen story is not a partisan or policy academic debate. It began years before #Khashoggi and Trump. It‚Äôs truth lies somewhere between the Oval Office‚Äôs cold Hard geopolitics, Riyadh‚Äôs brutal frenemy regime, and Kristof‚Äôs stunning grounds-eye view of human suffering.

Iran "created the situation that we have now in Yemen" - says LTG McKenzie to @SenTomCotton, teeing up the general to say out loud that Yemen is Iran's fault and it's Iran's ballistic missiles that keep hitting Saudi and sea lanes.
Here comes @SenTomCotton with the first question on Iran, nearly 1 hour into the Centcom &amp; Socom commanders' confirmation hearing.
LTG Clarke says there are five special operations truths.		Hey @JeffSchogol, what's the first truth of special operations?
On Afghanistan war frustration, LTG McKenzie to @SenGaryPeters: "I understand your frustration. I've been there twice. My son's been there twice." Says Afghans are doing the fighting now, if "imperfectly," and diplomatic effort/talks is new, it's not the same war.
Direct question, from @SenGaryPeters: How far are Afghan forces from being able to secure selves w/o US forces?	LTG McKenzie: "If we left precipitously right now I don't believe they would be able to successfully defend their country...I don't know how long it's going to take."
JUST IN: Afghan military "losses are not going to be sustainable unless we correct this problem," of continued heavy casualties and help Afghan forces more with recruiting and training, says incoming Centcom commander LTG McKenzie.
On Syria post-liberation area stability ops: Gen. Votel pounded the table in January for more help from the int'l community. Last month in this exclusive podcast interview with @DefenseOne he said it's better but more needed: https://t.co/cMdQMyoMe9
McKenzie easily takes @SenatorShaheen softball on #Syria's non-military stabilization $$$ needs: "We are doing to have to adequately fund" it, he tells the Senate.
McKenzie, asked what he says to families of 13 American KIAs this year: "We are protecting the American homeland from attack"... "Afghans and Americans who have died in Afghanistan have all been pursuing an honorable and reasonable objective."
McKenzie: "I feel the Afghan people are weary of war"...and don't care for US occupation but Taliban polling very low. "Afghans don't all want us to leave...a lot of afghans dont' want the Taliban to come back"

LTG McKenzie notes to top SASC Democrat @SenatorJackReed the slowness in filling vacancies of policy positions at @DeptofDefense do not represent any cultural change at Pentagon. (Ahem, White House...)
Inhofe says Russia and China developing weapons/tech that's a new advantage for them. Asks incoming SOCOM commander what he thinks of their advantages.	LTG Clarke (not taking bait): I'd talk about advantages we have that Russia and China don't have...(namely) special operations.
New SASC Chairman Sen. @JimInhofe's first question is not bout the wars, not about https://t.co/DfXtTMOnlD strategy, not about GWOT or the continued over-reliance on military for US presence and foreign policy pressure....it's on the budget.
