We need to make investments in #5G, secure these networks, and make sure they are resilient against #cyberattacks. Our 21st century innovation economy depends on it.
Many underserved rural and Tribal areas in Washington still lack quality wireless and wireline #broadband service. We cannot leave these areas out of the economic opportunities provided by connectivity.
I believe the U.S. will continue to dominate the innovation economy. One of the best examples of this innovative spirit is the work going on in #SmartCities, and one of the best proving grounds for this technology can be found in Spokane.
If we roll up our sleeves and get serious about #cyber, I believe the United States will continue to dominate the innovation economy and win the race to #5G.
I‚Äôm calling on the @FCC to use its existing authority to help make sure #5G communications networks are safe and secure. Congress is watching.
I am calling on the Trump administration to finally get serious about #cybersecurity. It should provide all of us with a real, quantifiable #5G security threat assessment.
#5G promises interconnectivity on an unprecedented scale. These networks will be part of the bedrock of our innovation economy.

The failure to reopen the government puts lives at risk by undermining the ability to respond to #wildfires and will only serve to delay critical forest restoration &amp; safety projects. Every day the shutdown continues, the more the fire risk for the 2019 season grows.

Because of the #TrumpShutdown, an estimated 2.2 million low-income households are among those at risk of eviction from their homes. For the sake of the families whose homes are at stake, I've urged President Trump to end the shutdown and protect the American people.

Dr. Ford showed great strength and courage in painting for the nation the long-lasting impacts of sexual assault.
The Senate should not move forward on the Kavanaugh nomination. Dr. Ford's strong testimony should be enough to stop any further votes before a complete nonpartisan investigation takes place.
The U.S. Senate should move in a serious but deliberate and cautious path tomorrow. It should not spend time prosecuting a woman, but rather listening to the facts and information that she gives.
My Republican colleagues don't think they're doing damage, they think they're sticking up for a nominee. But the desire today has to be that we don't make the same mistakes as other institutions. We must pay attention to these allegations and we must take them seriously.

We in Washington state have witnessed firsthand the disaster of #wildfires and what the aftermath means for people living in affected communities. Our heroic #firefighters do everything they can to be ready for the fire season, and we need to do the same.
Almost half of Washington state renters are cost burdened, spending over 30% of their income on rent. There are only 29 affordable &amp; available homes for every 100 extremely low income families. More needs to be done to get to the root causes of the #affordablehousing crisis.
If protections for pre-existing conditions are rolled back, more than 3 million Washingtonians could be at risk. That means 3 million Washingtonians could not have #health insurance either because it‚Äôs too costly or because they‚Äôre denied coverage.
Deterring foreign enemies from attacking our #election systems and other critical infrastructure is just the first step we must take to protect our national security and democratic institutions. #DETERact https://t.co/lB48nJ2nhg
In 42 days, we face the deadline of the #LWCF, a key tool that allows us to continue to recreate, hunt, fish, and hike. I hope we can work together in a bipartisan fashion to get the Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund reauthorized. #SaveLWCF https://t.co/ODM6uu0kRV
This #wildfire season, making sure that those on the fire line have the best possible information is critical. https://t.co/j8wQWLO2dl
The affordable housing crisis is very real in Washington state. Since 2010, median rents have risen by 19.7% ‚Äì almost 7% higher than those nationwide. I'm prioritizing #affordablehousing in my work in the Senate because so much more needs to be done.
We're fighting for the inclusion of people, not prejudice against those with pre-existing conditions. Someone's medical history should not be used to discriminate against them. https://t.co/vI1EZUxt4H
The administration needs to take stronger action to prioritize #cybersecurity of energy networks and fight cyber aggression. There is a need for additional cybersecurity resources to address our fundamental concerns.
In the foothills of the Cascades and in the shadows of Mt. Rainier, the Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund has helped us continue to preserve great resources and great assets. #SaveLWCF https://t.co/nW1SNe0bqk
I want to make sure that firefighters have every tool available to help fight these #wildfires. We need to make sure they are as safe and efficient as possible.
Community health centers are a lean and efficient #healthcare delivery model, focusing on primary care, prevention, case management, and social services for their patients. They are an indispensable part of our #healthcare delivery system. #NHCW18
For millions of Americans, a lack of affordable housing has profound, negative &amp; lasting consequences. More still needs to be done to get to the root causes of the #affordablehousing crisis and show that the Low Income Housing Tax Credit is cost-effective &amp; creates jobs. #LIHTC
Washington‚Äôs 27 community health centers serve more than 1 million patients each year. They are an indispensable part of our #healthcare delivery system, supporting more than 9,000 state jobs and $1 billion in annual economic output. #NHCW18
The Affordable Care Act made a number of improvements to #health insurance, including protecting people with pre-existing conditions from being denied insurance or charged more on the basis of their health status. We must defend this provision of the law.
The conclusion of American intelligence agencies is crystal clear: Russian interference in our elections is a fact. We must take immediate action to protect and secure our elections from future meddling by Russia or anyone else. #DETERact https://t.co/7Gl2HPmQob
For the economy, sportsmen, veterans, wildlife, and our kids, we must permanently reauthorize #LWCF. In Washington state alone, the outdoor recreation economy contributes over $26 billion in consumer spending and supports more than 201,000 direct jobs.		https://t.co/kN0jHMygzY

In Washington, more than 13,000 internet companies provide more than 250,000 jobs. We want to keep this American success story going, which is why it's so important for children throughout the United States to be able to learn to code in school.
Computer jobs are the #1 source of new jobs in the country. There are currently more than 500,000 computer job openings in the U.S. We have to close this skills gap if we want to continue to develop these new products &amp; services.
In keeping with longstanding legal, ethical, and medical standards of #healthcare, Title X providers can offer patients medically-accurate counseling on and referrals for all pregnancy options, including parenting, adoption, and abortion. I oppose efforts to undermine #TitleX.
Every student in America should be taught the tools they need to enter our 21st century economy. In Washington state, we're making progress in this area because 31% of our high schools offer coding classes, but more still needs to be done.
53 years after the signing of the #VotingRightsAct, we must continue our work to strengthen this legislation and oppose judges who would roll back voting rights for any American. Every citizen should receive an equal say in their government.
Hats off to Spokane for building what is the most innovative building, I think, in America. I guarantee you, you will be the envy of the nation.		https://t.co/yuwDOrv0Hg
The Trump administration has taken regulatory actions to tilt #TitleX away from evidence-based #familyplanning. I believe federal health policy should be evidence-based &amp; produced with the best interests of patients in mind.

#DidYouKnow: Each year, roughly 4,000,000 people rely on #TitleX-funded health centers for basic preventive health care, including cancer screenings, birth control, STI screenings, pregnancy testing, and well-woman exams.
Legislation I introduced to help high schools advance #computerscience and #coding skills was recently signed into law. These skills are critical to the jobs of the future, national security, and the economic competitiveness of the United States.
#Medicare &amp; #Medicaid are lifelines to affordable #healthcare for millions of Washingtonians. We need to protect these vital programs and promote health care innovation to improve them ‚Äì not cut, cap, or block grant them.
As we celebrate the 53rd anniversary of the #VotingRightsAct, let‚Äôs remember our responsibility to guard against inequality and injustice at the polls. Every citizen should receive an equal say in their government. #VRA
The Trump administration‚Äôs push to allow junk health insurance plans will make it harder for families to pay the bills &amp; access care.
In Washington state, #TitleX‚Äífunded sites delivered contraceptive care to 82,520 women in 2015. Title X‚Äísupported #PlannedParenthood health centers served 80% of these women. https://t.co/00oLdnHZyY
Learning to write and read #code is critical to creating and innovating in cyberspace. In high schools, fewer AP exams are taken in #computerscience than any other STEM subject area. While 58% of new STEM jobs are in computing, only 8% of #STEM graduates are in computer science.
This month, we celebrate #Medicaid‚Äôs 53rd anniversary as a successful and innovative state and federal #healthcare partnership. Plans to cut, cap, or block grant Medicaid are not innovative ‚Äì they are a budget mechanism to cut people off of health care.
Since 1965, the #VotingRightsAct has prohibited measures that once disenfranchised many minority voters and has helped new citizens make their voices heard. We have a responsibility to guard against inequality and injustice at the polls. #VRA https://t.co/6xSwTMwKcr

In the GOP tax law, oil companies got a $4 billion dollar tax break (on top of a lower corporate tax rate). And yet here we are, months later, paying higher gas prices. What did Washingtonians get out of those tax breaks? I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs fair use of taxpayer money.
Aside from the fact that we‚Äôre continuing to put unsustainable levels of carbon into the atmosphere, America‚Äôs increase in #fossilfuel production seems only to be padding the bloated oil economy profits rather than helping the household budgets of many consumers.

If people don‚Äôt have #healthcare insurance or can‚Äôt pay for it, they don‚Äôt just disappear. They end up needing emergency care at a very high cost. We can't go backwards, as President Trump wants, by striking down protections for pre-existing conditions. We must go forward.
When primary care is successfully managed, costs on the entire #healthcare system are reduced.
Make no mistake: If the provision of the #ACA that protects Americans with pre-existing conditions is struck down, it would lead to more chaos. Millions of people would be at risk of discrimination or denial of #healthcare coverage.

The American people deserve a Senate hearing on one of the most pressing issues facing our country. @SenJudiciary has a duty to conduct proper oversight of how the Trump Administration is going to fix the crisis it created &amp; reunify separated children with their parents.
In Clark County, 188,400 people under 65 have a pre-existing condition. If President Trump gets his way, they too could be faced with the unfortunate situation of having an insurer discriminate against them‚Äîdenying them access to #healthcare or making it more expensive.
Denying #healthcare to those with pre-existing conditions actually costs everyone more in the end. Emergency rooms would be flooded with people waiting to get care, and those costs would be astronomical. Health care rates for all of us could increase.

We need to defend the provision of the #ACA that protects coverage for pre-existing conditions. It should continue to be the law of the land. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sending another letter to President Trump, asking him to protect coverage of pre-existing conditions.
Many different groups are asking to defend coverage for pre-existing conditions. @AmerMedicalAssn, @AmerAcadPeds, @AmericanCancer, @AmDiabetesAssn, @American_Heart, @ahahospitals, and @AAMCtoday are all speaking loudly &amp; clearly because they know exactly what we‚Äôre fighting for.
I sent a letter to President Trump, asking him to tell @TheJusticeDept we need to fight to cover pre-existing conditions, not stand on the sidelines or allow other attorneys general to fight against them.
We want patients in Washington state to be protected. America‚Äôs patients, hospitals, doctors, and nurses are all weighing in: Denying people insurance is a bad idea.
If protections for pre-existing conditions are rolled back, more than 3 million Washingtonians could be at risk. That means 3 million Washingtonians could either not have #health insurance because it‚Äôs too costly or just be denied coverage.
On June 7th, the Trump Administration‚Äôs @TheJusticeDept refused to defend the Affordable Care Act's pre-existing conditions provision in court. Even though these protections are the law of the land and should be enforced &amp; upheld by any administration, they aren‚Äôt doing that.
President Trump and his team are basically saying they want to undo the very protections that allow patients get access to #healthcare even if they have a pre-existing condition. This leaves 3 over million Washingtonians at risk.
Just a few years ago, people were commonly denied #health insurance for pre-existing conditions. If they didn‚Äôt get a denial, they got some exorbitant rate. That could mean the difference between getting care and not getting care.
We want to make sure patients are not denied access to #healthcare just because of diabetes or asthma or some other pre-existing condition.

The stakes were raised in the fight to protect #healthcare with the recent retirement on the U.S. Supreme Court. President Trump now has the opportunity to provide a lifetime appointment to a justice who could undermine health care access &amp; protections for millions of Americans.
#DidYouKnow: More than 3 million Washingtonians under the age of 65 have a pre-existing condition, which can include conditions ranging from allergies, asthma &amp; high blood pressure to cancer &amp; diabetes.
Earlier this month, the Trump Administration escalated its deliberate attempts to take away Americans‚Äô #healthcare &amp; insurance protections when @TheJusticeDept announced it would not defend the Affordable Care Act's pre-existing condition protections.
This morning, I‚Äôm joining patient advocates &amp; health providers at @VirginiaMason in Seattle to call on the Trump Administration &amp; Congress to protect coverage for the millions of Washingtonians who have a pre-existing condition or will need this critical coverage in the future.

Learning to write and read #code is critical to creating and innovating in cyberspace. In high schools, fewer AP exams are taken in #computerscience than any other STEM subject area. While 58% of new STEM jobs are in computing, only 8% of STEM graduates are in computer science.
By reducing the costs of establishing #compsci curriculum, the main barrier to entry for high schools to provide quality #coding classes, my legislation will help prepare the next generation of computer scientists to meet the demands of the #hightech workforce.
Our #agriculture industry is facing unprecedented barriers as American farmers seek to export their products. Increased funding for well-established export programs is what our #farmers need.
In Washington state, only 1,212 students graduated from college with #compsci degrees in 2015, leaving more than 16,200 computing jobs unfilled today. We need to prepare the next generation to meet the demands of the #hightech workforce.
Increased foreign competition, along with trade policies that directly harm U.S. agricultural products, puts our #farmers at a disadvantage and at serious risk of losing out in the foreign #agricultural marketplace.
Today‚Äôs students should be exposed to the computer skills of the 21st Century. By ensuring high school students can access #computerscience and #coding education, we can close the skills gap and boost our country‚Äôs competitive position globally.
As federal support for @USDA's export programs remains stagnant, foreign competitors are increasing funding for #agricultural export programs to grow their international presence. Increased funding for well-established export programs is what our #farmers desperately need.
FACT: The family separation &amp; detention policy adopted by the Trump Administration is not required by U.S. law. Under Section 212 of the Immigration &amp; Nationality Act, @DHSgov is legally allowed to provide #humanitarian parole to asylum seekers awaiting immigration proceedings.
In our state &amp; across the nation, our tech industry is booming &amp; creating jobs every day, but curriculum isn't keeping up. By ensuring high school students can access #compsci and #coding education, we can close the skills gap &amp; boost our country‚Äôs competitive position globally.
As American #agricultural products face increasing competition &amp; barriers to entry in markets around the world, funding for effective agricultural export programs is an important tool for American agriculture to remain competitive &amp; continue its role as a driver of the economy.

What is the process for reuniting children separated from their parents at the border? Is it different from the process for other unaccompanied children?
What is the administration doing to proactively find the parents of detained children and help them make contact with their children?
Does the administration have a system to ensure parents in federal custody can speak with their children on a daily basis? Does this system extend to parents who have already been deported from the United States?
Does the administration ensure parents and relatives who are non-English speaking are provided with materials and instructions in their native language, or are translation services provided?
Does the administration have a system to ensure parents or their attorneys can locate their children?
How many children are in the custody of @HHSGov who were separated from their parents at the border and have not yet been reunified with their parents or released to local family members?
While we are encouraged that President Trump has signed an executive order to stop the unnecessary and cruel separation of children from their families, by no means is this crisis over. Here are some of the outstanding questions I still have for the Trump Administration:
Individual businesses that fight every day to get access to Asian markets, to India, to Canada, to Mexico ‚Äîbelieve in a #trade policy that keeps moving forward. Why? Because they gain access to a middle class around the globe.		https://t.co/SZMebo0R86

I am concerned about President Trump's trade policies. 50% of our #airplanes are sold into overseas markets. When you start putting tariffs on steel &amp; aluminum, there's an impact. We don‚Äôt want to see a trade war erupt &amp; make the U.S. less competitive in the #aviation market.
Now that the Senate has taken the critical step of passing a resolution to overturn the @FCC's repeal of #netneutrality, it is incumbent on the House of Representatives to listen to the voices of consumers and keep the internet free and open for all.
I joined @PattyMurray and 38 of my Senate colleagues to demanding the Trump Administration stop further traumatizing children. It should end its inhumane policy of separating innocent boys and girls from families who cross the Southwest border seeking asylum in the United States.

I am concerned about President Trump's trade policies. Take a look at #aviation, which employs over 100,000 people in the Northwest in manufacturing jobs of good middle class wages. We don‚Äôt want to lose that competition.
As we approach formal implementation of the @FCC‚Äôs #netneutrality repeal on June 11, I've called on House @SpeakerRyan to schedule a vote on the Senate CRA resolution that overturns the FCC's disastrous decision to repeal net neutrality rules.
Our government has a humanitarian duty to the children and families seeking asylum in the United States. President Trump should immediately end his cruel policy of separating children from their parents at the border.

Our Democratic colleagues in the House are taking up the fight for an open and free internet. But now it‚Äôs time for House Republicans to decide: will they stand with big cable or will they stand with consumers, entrepreneurs, and small businesses? #NetNeutrality
Senate Republicans voted today to give big cable the keys to the internet so they can block, slow down, or manipulate consumer access. They'll give every excuse possible about why they sided with big cable, but 1 thing is clear: Protecting #NetNeutrality is an economic necessity.
Getting exorbitant internet fees from cable providers is not the direction the American people want to go. Entrepreneurs, innovators, and consumers cannot afford to take that hit. What they want to see is an #openinternet that continues to allow the internet economy to flourish.
Whether you‚Äôre a tech entrepreneur creating the next killer app or a small business owner that sells online, or you work from home or shop online ‚Äì #NetNeutrality is critical to our economy and everyday lives.

Large quantities of #opioids are flooding our communities. In @EverettCity, 1 physician wrote over 10K prescriptions of the highly-addictive Oxycontin‚Äî26 times the city's average. Drug companies that fail to report suspicious distribution practices should face federal penalties.
I've introduced legislation to increase federal funding for #opioid education, treatment, and recovery programs and to hold opioid manufacturers accountable for negligent distribution and misleading advertising. This epidemic has afflicted every area of society.
I visited @SeaTacAirport with @TSA_Pekoske this morning to discuss new automated screening lanes, passenger screening canines, and efforts to address increasing passenger traffic at the airport. As our economy continues to grow, so does traffic at #SeaTac.	https://t.co/eCj8B3PGYF
I fought to secure $3.3 billion in the recent spending deal to combat the #opioid &amp; mental health epidemics. This funding provides critical investments in medication-assisted treatment, #naloxone for first responders, &amp; funds for additional treatment and recovery services.
Snohomish County was an early adopter of using #naloxone to help prevent #opioid overdoses &amp; the county has already used it to save 185 lives. By bringing down the cost of naloxone, we can get this life-saving drug in the hands of more people. Doing so will save lives.

Our legislation to #HonorGleason with the #CongressionalGoldMedal is now cosponsored by 34 senators‚Äîhalfway to the support needed to move forward. Steve Gleason is an inspiration to all of us. Spokane and Washington state couldn‚Äôt be more proud to call him one of our own.
In @SnoCounty, 90 people died from #opioid and #heroin overdoses in 2016‚Äîthat's roughly 18 percent of all Washington state heroin-related deaths. Nearly 700 Washingtonians &amp; 42,000 Americans died of an opioid overdose in 2016 alone. It‚Äôs time we fight back.

Since 2015, @EximBankUS has not had a fully operational board able to review &amp; approve the types of deals that would expand U.S. exports. Foreign export credit agencies are filling the void, meaning more U.S. jobs will be sent overseas and U.S. workers &amp; companies disadvantaged.

The weather is drier &amp; we‚Äôre seeing more #wildfires &amp; homes destroyed. Now is not the time to cut Forest Service research. To get ahead of the problem, we need robust science. @ForestService‚Äôs Pacific Wildland Fire Sciences Lab in Seattle is an example of that kind of research.

Our #wildfire funding fix reauthorized @ForestService's Secure Rural Schools program for 2 more years. This is so important for the #PacificNorthwest because it ensures communities aren‚Äôt left without funding while we look to create permanent solutions.
We need to invest in our #NationalParks. It‚Äôs not only good for the outdoor economy and for our citizens, but it‚Äôs part of what helps fund our U.S. economy. #NationalParkWeek #FindYourPark
Thanks to our #wildfire funding fix, the @ForestService will no longer have to borrow funding from other programs to get firefighters to the fire line, and it won‚Äôt need to transfer money from land management accounts to pay for funding.

President Trump‚Äôs nominee to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has tried to take away reproductive rights for women, he‚Äôs defended restrictive voting laws, and he‚Äôs argued against same-sex marriage. I opposed his confirmation and urged my colleagues to do the same.
We are committed to making health insurance premiums more affordable for all consumers &amp; expanding the number of options. Creating a new class of health insurance plans that lack basic patient protections &amp; could lead to higher prices does not achieve this goal.

Our energy infrastructure is under attack. It‚Äôs under cyber attack, and we need to do much more to protect it as a national critical asset. Russia has proven its ability to disrupt the grid.

We do not believe the 23 announced ‚Äúopen house‚Äù meetings are adequate in duration, location, nor format needed to meet the public input requirements. Formal oral testimony, as opposed to open house format, would better ensure that people‚Äôs concerns are heard &amp; recorded publicly.
These public hearings are a critical opportunity for citizens to learn about and comment on the @Interior Department's five year #offshoredrilling plan, and due to the geographic extent of the proposed leasing program, it is imperative to provide adequate access for each region.
We believe a 60-day extension of the deadline for comments is necessary to allow for more public hearings in coastal areas and to give the public sufficient time to submit comments on offshore drilling.
Today I led 22 of my Senate colleagues in demanding a 60-day extension of the public comment period for the Department of the @Interior‚Äôs offshore drilling plan.

The Trump Administration‚Äôs proposal to allow drilling off the coast in the Pacific region represents an outrageous attack on our coastal economies, culture, and environment.
