@dbongino @Adri64307529 I answered every question...
@SethAbramson Q15: The FBI has already outed themselves for spying directly on Trump. This question is pointless, and intentionally misleading.		Side Note: And again, Israel pops up out of nowhere.
@SethAbramson Q14: The only good question you've asked so far. This needs an answer.
@SethAbramson Q13: This makes no sense. Anyone that has even had a real job knows that if you want to keep a door open for coming back, you give notice, work out the companies notice time policy, and must wait for your new opportunity to open up. Your research is severely lacking on this one.
@SethAbramson Q12: Pap was being nice. Elizabeth Vaughn has already proven Roh, and the FBI, lied about these very things. In their defense, the FBI had to lie to protect their still as yet unknown true asset. More than likely, "Putin's Niece" is the asset, and also a British agent.
@SethAbramson Q11: Because the peace efforts with Russia were a secret. Most of these staff members weren't privy to information about it. For good reason. Look what's happened AFTER it became known.
@SethAbramson Q10: Irrelevant. The speech writing was a time filler for a short period when Pap had nothing to physically do. Also, a false statement. Pap was given a position on Trump's Russia Peace Initiative as a "reward."
@SethAbramson Q9: Again, again. Provide a basis, and a question. This many fishing expeditions would prompt a judge to find you in contempt.		Side note: What does Israel have to do with the oil production within the UAE? Why have you repeatedly found a way to shoehorn Israel into this?
@SethAbramson Q8: #RuleOfThumb - Excerpts are never within context. For example: Why hasn't this come up within the prosecution? Because the prosecutors have the intact emails.
@SethAbramson Q7: A LOT of people that do outstanding work for the campaigns get positions within administrations. This question is utterly ridiculous. What "service" did Jeff Sessions perform for which AG was recompense? What "service" did Pence perform for which VP was recompense?
@SethAbramson Q6: This has no basis in reality. If Pap had a meeting with Putin, "Putin's niece" never would have been involved dangling that carrot in front of him.
@SethAbramson Q5: Again, no basis and no question. Describe what you are fishing for, so this sounds a lot less anti-Semitic.
@SethAbramson Q4: This is a declaration, and demand. Not a question. Spell out the basis for it with a question. The justice system frowns on fishing expeditions.
@SethAbramson Q3: Who cares? After it was revealed that Mifsud was a British agent, it's obvious they simply wanted to keep him close so that he couldn't blow the entire setup against Trump before it could take root.
@SethAbramson Q2: No, he didn't. He said he had 1 call, and 1 meeting, with the Greek Foreign Minister, where he revealed that he had been told Russia had dirt on Hillary. He never mentioned "email" in these conversations.
@SethAbramson Q1: If that email existed, wouldn't it have been produced as evidence, and like everything else leaked to the #MSM? But alas, no such email has ever been entered into evidence.

@TelainaE Yes indeed. However, there are hand stamps for those situations. It has already been stated the packages were caught at screening at their destinations. So they made it all the way through the mail system... That isn't even remotely likely.
8) Notice a theme yet? What is the one constant in #Magic...		#Misdirection. https://t.co/88XejDlUmv
7) His #Facebook had #ProLiberal posts. Including #TurnFloridaBlue. Then, a few minutes after being discovered, his page was GONE like #Magic!
6) His #PartyAffiliation was changed from #Democrat to #Republican on the day of his #Arrest. Since he was already in #Custody, he changed it using #Magic! https://t.co/ghhZjsR1ZF
5) The #Clocks used have no #AlarmFunction. There is no way for them to set off anything. I guess they were to be set off by #Magic! https://t.co/mGmuBC930e
4) NONE of the #SuspiciousPackages has #PostOfficeMarks on the stamps. They were NEVER in the mail system. Must have been sent by owl using #Magic! https://t.co/x8ajLbZBaZ
3) The #TrumpStickers on his #Van were placed there the same day he was #Arrested. If they were there for a while they would have faded in the #FloridaSun unless protected by #Magic! https://t.co/R612xiiyV2
2) His #Twitter account ONLY follows #Democrats. I suppose he was keeping up with #Trump through #Magic!

7) Mark my words. If this continues down the inevitable #CollisionCourse that it currently is, #Mexico and the #Democrats are going to be responsible for a #MigrantMassacre.
6) The #DrugCartels WILL open fire on this #InvasionForce of #Migrants to stop the #USBorders from being shut down by the #USMilitary. It will be a horrible #Bloodbath if these idiots keep marching toward our #Borders just because they were paid to.
5) #Soros and the #Democrats are so #IndustrialStrengthStupid that they think this is going to be an unrecoverable nightmare for @realDonaldTrump , but they are murderously wrong.
4) The #DrugCartels.		The #DrugCartelLeaders are NOT stupid. They know a #Military controlled border means HUGE lose of profits. Unimaginable lose of profits. And lose of access to #MoneyLaundering in the #USA.

5) ALL of the nationwide races show much the same thing, with #Republicans holding an average 6.5% lead on #Democrat rivals. All while #CNN, #MSNBC, etc. all tell you that the races are leaning the other way...		Exactly as it happened in 2016.
4) After the numbers are adjusted correctly, by removing bias through probability averages, as correctly predicted the Presidential race in 2016, #Feinstein only has a 2.5 point lead over #Leon. WAY too close for comfort.
3) The current polling numbers for the #FeinsteinVsLeon race show #Feinstein with an incredibly comfortable 15.5% lead over #Leon. Enough to make anyone of sound mind comfortable.		However...
2) They get FAR too comfortable in the "leads" that #CNN and #InternalPolls tell them they have. Leads that are delusions of grandeur at best. For example...
1) Any of my old followers know that I correctly call races using poll numbers, and I just want to say, these falsely adjusted poll numbers are why #Democrats keep loosing.
@LarrySchweikart Having said that, my overall numbers for the midterms are nearly identical to your conclusions. At this moment in time I have Republicans, again overall, showing a 6.5% lead nation wide.
@LarrySchweikart First, I find your work very stimulating. Good job in your analysis. However, I correctly called the Primaries using polls. You shouldn't discount them out of hand. I took the sampling numbers and applied probabilities to them. The law of averages. I was correct to within 0.5%.
