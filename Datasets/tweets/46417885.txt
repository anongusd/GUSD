Oh my. Graham is going off on Democrats. "This is the most unethical sham since I've been in politics." Accuses them of wanting to hold out until 2020 to help control the seat.
Kavanaugh tells Mitchell that Chris Garrett -- invoked in Whelan's disastrous mistaken identity theory -- is the "Squi" cited in a calendar entry that refers to "skis" with Judge, PJ [Smyth], &amp; others.		Judge and Smyth were two people Ford has said she believes were at the party.
‚ÄúI know what kind of a person he is,‚Äù Hatch says of Kavanaugh during the break, adding that he‚Äôs ready to vote in committee tomorrow.
But for my money, *Mitchell* actually got the most compelling response from Kavanaugh so far.		https://t.co/dgw5fkjB1X
The tonal contrast between Kavanaugh and Feinstein right now is notable. He comes off as aggravated (regardless of the merits of his reasons for that). She comes off as calm.
Now that we are back, Kavanaugh is out with proverbial guns blazing. He cites the RI allegation, which only came out last night and has been debunked, in saying his name has been "destroyed."		These claims, he says, are "a calculated and orchestrated political hit."
Before we came back from break, Rachel Mitchell met with this good dog https://t.co/LslyzN6NqR
And Ford is done, after Harris and Booker largely used their time to laud her for coming forward to testify.		Kavanaugh is next, after a 45-min break.
We are back from lunch, and Mitchell is pursuing a more prosecutorially delivered line of questioning about who, if anyone, may have reached out on Ford's behalf.		This feels designed to elicit her awareness, or not, of what others (Dems?) were doing.
RT @burgessev: News: Hatch says Republicans will likely allow Mitchell to question Kavanaugh. ‚ÄúThe more we stay out of it the better‚Äù https‚Ä¶

The science of polygraphs has come under big, legit scrutiny. 		But as the WH circulates this, it's worth noting that in a 2016 opinion, Kavanaugh wrote the gov't "has satisfactorily explained how polygraph examinations serve law enforcement purposes." https://t.co/NzsLhK2DEH
Grassley is reiterating his request for supporting data behind Ford's polygraph exam. We first reported this yesterday -- her legal team said they weren't prepared to comply on about an hour's notice. https://t.co/kadTiWRu6L
Now Mitchell is asking about Ford's taking a plane to DC. This is based on press reports about Ford's fear of flying as connected to her alleged trauma, which some Rs have suggested is hyperbolic.		Ford describes flights as "anxiety-provoking" but makes clear she's taken them.
Rachel Mitchell‚Äôs questions to Ford so far have been notably evenhanded. She‚Äôs back up now.

Harris asks a very important question for her party: Can Dems have a look at the maps Mitchell is using to question Ford? 		OK, Grassley says. (No copies available here at the press table.)

Rachel Mitchell asked Ford about the number of people she alleges attended the party where the assault occurred. Ford clarifies that her description wasn't necessarily meant to be definitive as to how many other kids were there. 		More on this issue: https://t.co/kadTiWRu6L
As Ford testifies that "it is not my responsibility" to decide if Kavanaugh gets confirmed and that the reality of stepping forward has been "far worse than I expected," a logistical note -- her husband is not here today. He has stayed behind to be with their kids.
One aspect of Ford's raw, emotional reading of her statement that struck me -- she relays telling herself after the fact that she "should just move on" because she was not raped.

Grassley opens by apologizing to both Kavanaugh and Ford. 		He then strongly defends the way Republicans have handled Ford's allegations, citing an Anita Hill-era Biden quote dismissing the value of an FBI probe that the GOP has repeatedly touted this week.

Remember those fireworks from Booker about releasing committee-confidential documents? Turns out the docs were *already cleared for release* last night, per a GOP Judiciary spokesman -- before Booker made his camera-ready play.

Oh, yes, good -- Hatch is asking the Kasowitz question again. "I don't recall any conversations of that kind with anyone at that law firm ... haven't had any inappropriate conversations about that investigation with anyone."

Pretty sure Kavanaugh just told Coons he's never taken a position on whether a sitting president can be indicted. Here's an instance in which he certainly seemed to weigh in on that question. https://t.co/h2tAFQUyez
For my money, Coons has been the most effective Dem questioner so far today. Kavanaugh is shrugging off much of Coons' work to get clear answers, but it's the first sweat he's shown in a while.

My question: Do the optics of this -- Kyl boosting Kavanaugh from the outside, then voting for him -- change Dems' willingness to engage in a procedural blockade of further votes, beyond today's hearing fireworks? https://t.co/1P1ZFdugMD
Looks like Kyl could soon be in position to vote for Kavanaugh -- whose nomination he was sherpa-ing through the confirmation process.

‚ÄúWe oughta have this loudmouth removed,‚Äù Hatch muses as another protester interrupts his opening statement and is escorted out.
The view from the Dem base, which had been frustrated over the lack of fight from Schumer's caucus: https://t.co/j297Llvx4x
Protester disruptions are resuming now, even after Dems' interruptions reach a lull. Grassley is, so far, talking through them.
RT @kaitlancollins: The White House is highlighting how many times Democrats have interrupted during the Kavanaugh hearing. https://t.co/ob‚Ä¶
Note that all of this is theoretical -- Rs could vote by proxy if it comes to that. Worth noting that Grassley already has vowed to go into the weekend if necessary in order to finish the hearing.
One reason why Dems are pressing for a vote now on adjourning the hearing: The committee is narrowly divided and at least one R (Crapo) is nowhere to be seen on the dais, so they could theoretically win.
Tillis is now challenging Dems on their advance planning of this morning's Kavanaugh hearing disruption. Schumer participated in a coordination call on this strategy, per source familiar. Follow our running, UPDATED SCOTUS story here. https://t.co/lwyE20qi7E
"Senator Kennedy!" Grassley says, recognizing only the second Republican attempting to speak during the Dem protest like he's just been thrown a life preserver.		Kennedy asks for more info on the ground rules. "Are we going to be allowed to interrupt each other?"
@ec_schneider @mattsgorman Thank you my politico twinsie!
Two more protester interruptions as Booker and Hirono join the mass disruption effort. One appears to be from Code Pink. https://t.co/mpyda3h2q3
Protesters are now erupting and getting removed from the room by police. Blumenthal is moving for a roll-call vote. This is, needless to say, NOT how Republicans wanted to start this hearing.
HARRIS is seizing control right from the start -- pressuring Grassley to address the late-night release of documents. He's not getting time to deliver his opening statement. Klobuchar follows Harris. Now Blumenthal is moving to adjourn.
And here comes Kavanaugh, accompanied by his daughters. https://t.co/Nnw4CwVqct
