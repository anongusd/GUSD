The 4R system isn‚Äôt just a conservation system. It‚Äôs an economic system. It‚Äôs going to save you money, says Strom. #Classic18
Idea of picking back up on tpp is inherently flawed, but if we aren‚Äôt willing to redevelop our trade agreements so we can effectively deal with challenges, we‚Äôre in a much worse place, says Larew. #Classic18
I think the only way we pass a farm bill is to have agriculture, nutrition and conservation work together, says Mary Kay Thatcher, Syngenta. #Classic18
If a farm bill is rolled out that looks for reform in SNAP, you could see additional pressure in the crop insurance space, says Rob Larew, National Farmers Union. #Classic18
We should be smart in agriculture and think about how to create and build demand rather than build a law that will expire. I think some people have confused RIN prices with demand, says Perdue.

Rahe says adapt, assess, analyze and Act. They are four A's to making data work for you. #agdata16
Aaron Rahe giving tips on making your agronomic data work for you. #agdata16
Value creation depends on the perspective: -- easy to create apples to oranges comparisons. #agdata16
Frieberg: Lesson- turning the plant deeper green does not equal yield. #agdata16
Frieberg: For immobile nutrients--uptake is driven by root length. #agdata16
ABC's of management zones: A  zone: highest productivity; zone b: field average; Zone c- worst productivity usually needs drainage #agdata16
Frieberg: Understanding data uses and limitations; examples of disciplines that rely on observational or evidence-based data. #agdata16
Frieberg: In building "big data" we treat each 60'by 60' as an observation. #agdata16
Frieberg: Real world agronomy is integrated and projected. #agdata16
Dan Frieberg @#agdata16: We like to say maps are great way to visualize data but the data is key to decision making.
Climate FieldView: Iowa and Minnesota farmers say it's quick and easy and gets the prescriptions done accurately. #agdata16
Farmers can now use the levers: hybrid, target yield, seed cost and grain price to decide how to manage their risk vs reward. #agdata16
Next up at #agdata16: Climate Corporation breakout session-- Using data 2manage field variability and improve input efficiency.
Data contracts: "Think in terms of loss not cause." Producers need data restoration/destruction insurance. #agdata16
Farm data: It's not enough to own the data collected on farm. Instead ownership with control! #agdata16
Next up @ #agdata16: Farm data contracts: Bigest threat is cyber crimininals trying to get you to wire $$ to hackers/threats. #agdata16
Fulton: Biggest take away: Store and maintain backup copy of farm data-- organized by year! #agdata16
Choose conservation practices based on what problems you need to solve, says @StanBuman. #agdata16
Fulton: Label data.  Include year, farm/field, crop and type in folder names. #agdata16
Very sound advice from @StanBuman at #agdata16. https://t.co/9CyxuCPl7a
White spots in field=low organic matter, probably due to erosion, says @StanBuman. #agdata16 https://t.co/OYXBqpOowm

what if...EPA/anti-farming env. group gains access to fertilizer/soil test data? Uses to build campaign to restrict nutrient apps? #agdata16
what if.... you knew corn yields were 10% below trend line yields 10 days before USDA reports were released? Marketing? #agdata16
Data aggregation: Not all labs use the same testing procedures, therefore accurate analysis may be difficult. #agdata16
Data aggregations: Not all labs report nutrients the same way.. PPM vs. Lbs/ac #agdata16
Data sharing: Integrated Ag Services analyzes 70,000 soils tests/ yr. Those soils tests are owned by clients and can't be shared. #agdata16
Challenges of data aggregation: because there is no standardization yet, each service provider standardizes for their own needs. #agdata16
Challenges of data aggregation:	Some farmers don't see benefit from cloud services. THe velocity of data adds value. #agdata16
Tools are getting better: Powerful smart phones/tablets, cloud storage, data standardization slowly improving.... internet connections?
Standard operating procedures: Calibrations, electornic recrd keeping, data transfer and backup plan. #agdata16
Standard Operating procedures:	-- have written and communicate orally your operating procedures on data mgmt. Way to avoid gap in data.
Dave Scheiderer: Gaps in the data. Have to find ways to avoid it. #agdata16
Fulton: Work with trusted data partner. Evlauate data service options.  #agdata16
Not collecting and archiving data will limit farmer participation in data services. Data QUALITY has to be the focus.
Cons to data aggregation: farm exposure, benchmarking establishes vlaue and risks for other to understand, who owns aggregated data sets.
Another pro to data aggregations: Benchmark your farm	Agronomic, enterprise and marketing. #agdata16
Fulton: Pros 2 data aggregation: accelerated learning! Provides comparisons across regions/growing conditions, insights into practices
Fulton: Data quality: unlikely to improve. It's about collection-- right from the beginning. #agdata16
Data storage: Storing data day to day is cheap. Costs $300 a year for 5,000 ac farm with 10 years of data. #agdata16
Types of data:	Agronomic, machine, production, remote sensed imagery, public data and business. #agdata16
Fulton: Sensors are everywhere, machine to machine relationships (M2M), and sustainability-- #agdata16

Farmers Edge: Producers own the data collected. No one else. #agdata16
Landon Friesen: Big data from yields makes life easier-- no more climing in bins to calculate it. #agdata16
Reilly Vaughan: Big data is his ability to prove what he is doing on his family farm is best for farm and environment. #agdata16

Landon Friesen: Weather stations help with knowing whether it's suitable for spraying and crop insurance due to wet conditions. #agdata16
Trevor Scherman: Using data to analyze &amp; show what went wrong in  field. Said dad went 5 mph inst of 4.2 in planting. Showed dad $ lost .
Farmers Edge: Being able to articulate what is happening in your operation can be a task. Data in one place helps that. #agdata16
Farmer uses #big data with attorneys, bankers and financial providers. #agdata16
(2/2) The potential for improvement over the MRTN comes from this variability. #agdata16
Relationship to MRTN method: There is large variability in the yield response curves across seasons. (1/2) #agdata16
Why is N management hard? Optical sensors measure-- they don't predict. #agdata16
N management is science, not art. There is a right answer. #agdata16-- UAV providing data to help make decisions.
Goal of N Management: Maximize profit	If we know the yield response curve exactly we can maximize pfofit. #agdata16
#agdata16 https://t.co/x1aDaZmixD
#agdata16: Airborne sensors in UAV's result in much larger sample sizes (optical sensors) and increased confidence in conclusions.
Crops with enough N are darker and taller than crops that are N deficient. #agdata16
Craig Poling: Nitrogen management using optical sensros do what producers know from experience. #agdata16
Examples of what UAV's can sense: Nitrogen deficiencies and crop damage.  #agdata16
Data-- helping 2 answer critical  questions: Priority, focus &amp; interpret. 	Which fields 1st, where in the field &amp; what happening? #agdata16
Customized insights for decision making: Manage nitrogen apps; create seeding precriptions. #agdata16
Wilson: Phosphorus testing: One single flat  rate P application will not maximize profits and minimize environmental impact. #agdata16
Wilson: Have to optimize the fertilizer dollars budgeted for this crop season. #agdata16
#agdata is important because.water quality issues will require us 2 rethink N&amp;P applications. #agdata16  Ag has social responsibility.
Wilson: You only get one chance to collect data accurately!! #agdata16
Wilson: Verify calibration when we see "out of the ordinary" data on the monitor #agdata16
Calibration, calibration, calibration	Mike Wilson says calibration is most crucial part of data collection Verify it @ the start of season.
Mike Wilson: The ways he uses data on our farm today:	Grid soil sample every four years	Yield data for upcoming fertilizer appls	(1/2)	)
McGraw: Not all software is created equal.  #agdata16
Mobile nutrients, sample by zone made from EC/EM maps. #agdata16
More benefits from manure than commercial fertilizer. Worth having 2 pay for hauling, data gleamed from soil samples. . #agdata16
McGraw: You have got 2 have the numbers to manage soil &amp; fertilizer! You have got 2 have  numbers! That's why data is important. #agdata16
You can't believe the diversity of  soils we have 2 work w/ in this country.  Can vary just feet away from each other or states. #agdata16
Tom McGraw says Water management is the most critical part of agriculture. #agdata16
McGraw says no substitute for boots in the field. The soil map tells you what but not necessarily why some thing is happening. #agdata16

Most people don't know how hungry a 100-bushel soybean crop really is, says Arkels. #Classic16
Seed treatments are essential to high yield: biologicals, inoculants, fungicide, insecticide, says Arkels. #Classic16
Fertility is probably the limiting factor on a lot of soybean yields, says Arkels. #Classic16

If you set planter correctly, plants should emerge within 12 hrs. Anything that comes up after 24 hrs is a weed, says Albracht. #classic16
In 2016 I'm going to fine tune plans. Be more efficient. Not cutting back on anything though, says Steve Albracht, Texas farmer. #classic16
Future of corn has to be narrow rows. You can increase plant pop that with narrow rows so roots aren't crowded, says Below. #classic16
Anything we can to do improve fertilizer uptake goes a long way to getting yield out of that nutrient, says Fred Below, U of IL. #Classic16
We don't need to make nutrient placement complicated. It has to be effective, efficient and sustainable, says Kevin Sagehorn, Monsanto.
