@jogacolinho @TeamMilanAC I am afraid if he talks cutrone into leaving club to have more playing time (as his case) even by the cost of leaving His own glourious hme
@SiavoushF Now that they have added morrata (another contraversial face) who starts with messing with the captain! their future get even more hazy
@SiavoushF Even when Milan lose they stay as a team! when was last time you heard of an icardi or cesar alike situation happen at milan? This milan has only some technical issues whereas at inter some player's heart  beat for elsewhere while some other hate one another! not they
@SiavoushF Agree+/- Inter had better players and better results! But I cant't rememer when was the last time I see them having a better team than milan since 2010.A bunch of runner and killer players can give a some + result but not a solid team. Milan was always a better team spiritually.

@ACMilanSydney @MilanNewsit These positive changes, despite being due to having a killer striker, is also due to the amazing performances of both bakayoko and kessie! these two dudes keep the ball in the midfield so that wingers have more time to design attacks!
@WhatGattusoMad When frank and bakayoko play well, more chance is given to flanks and strikers to play
@milanmelbourne not only rest, but also to fight for a  fixed position! with a dose of competetive spirit among players to reach fixed VI, this team can ho for scudetto next ear! Agree?

@ACMilanSydney Milan has had this problem since years ago! Never accurate enough to turn it into goal. By the way when calabria is playing we see no crosses but conti made 2 assists by crosses. kessie is not himself.

@milanmelbourne I noticed after costa was subed he had more ⚽ on 🎯 than before. he is smart, moving and fast and sharp. belve me we never had such a player in football before. but if they consider him unsubst.ble then they will have problem in chnging tactics. as u said he'll make diff. in CL

@milanmelbourne We have spent about 400 m on stupid players last few years! when we could easily build a stadium! just like what juve did for a cause! milan's brand is dying and going from adidas to puma is a proof! all I am saying is that with people who talk like mirabeli we will nowhere

@milanmelbourne He can not treat their psychology by his karisma, karisma only is useful in implementng solutions for broken tactic department ...then results and wins will help team's psychology. rino is my love and I support him but he must become a problem solver quickly. or ciao my love
@milanmelbourne Well written!👏Rino got a champion midset and a leaderbkarisma. not enough experiences though which with a team lke real madrid wouldnt be so obvious (like zizo or pep at barsa) but in milan the team need experienced https://t.co/4JoRjfQWai who can solve team's tactical issues
@milanmelbourne I think milan owners should settle the matter down temporarily right know so newspapers dont put more pressure on him. w/out a rat's ass doubt he got talent and a bright future ahead of him, but as long as his our keeper ultras should support him.
@jogacolinho @MilanEye I sd he shd be replcd just to speed up our goal of going back wr w used to be, otherwise i am not against idea of giving him a second chance, but for suso who had kes and calab behind him and bona who had roma and biglia behind him,they shld be replcd.sorry for my stupid language
@jogacolinho @MilanEye I am cheering for a milan that with better players than hakan(best of worst thouhg) could be were lazio is now! if you are happy with our current failure then fuck off and chher for atalanta or fiorentina... coz u dont know what milan means to its fans

@milanmelbourne @AleMorenoESPN They lost to atletico,and thanks to qarabaq got 6 pts to reach next stage. shakhtar? even sassulo would've beaten them! chelsea,barsa would always be ashamed oof loosing to such a team and juve will never be ashamed for losing to real! they have great players but not a great team

@ASRomaEN @footballitalia By the way liverpool was not so above roma, he u believed it and made less errors from first second u could easily beat them! obviously its a big acheivement for roma and italia already! good luck in next season UCL
@ASRomaEN @footballitalia he is so right, the only reason roma made it to here is because valverdi fucked up so hard. liverpool with only 3 players destroyed your 5 defense line everytime. false passing and alot of other errors! bust still proud of what u did as a serie fan!forza milan

@ACMilanSydney just added it to my wach list. thanks
@ACMilanSydney EVERY TIME I watch Cinema paradiso I cant stop some tears in two scene, one when alfredo tells toto" technology always come late" since he had lost his eyes. secnd when toto knows alfredo s dead
@ACMilanSydney I had watched that one first! I had the same discusion with my bros about toto meetng his old time fiance after he met her daughter they laughed and said I've mixed movies. I searched weeks to prove I WAS RIGHT😀😀That made me watch it fr 5th or more time

@milanmelbourne I CAN EVEN GUES NAME OF THE MAN WALKING BEHIND THEM(left side of pic)
@TheSunFootball @LMatthaeus10 He was right about marcelo's weakness. but he forgets that marcelo has kroos and ramos as a backup most of the times who have casamero and modric as a back up. the only way bayern wins is if they play wide, compressive and deep and keep balance in midfield. real will win anyway
@CasaAcmilan Good point bro forza milan
@IFTVofficial Hope so but its not the same team and coach...liverpool is above barsa and klop is...no need to say...but lets hope
@HusseinY22 He has the character that will continue be great
@RossoneriBlog their main problems are wings (less after peroti come  in) and too many ball loss. they cant hold the fucking ball. but all n all I am proud of them as a serie a fan

@milanmelbourne that's right.but what happens to 6 7 8 th in serie a ? coz in that case italy will have 8 teams in euros? right ? 8th will go to play offs?
@milanmelbourne By the way I saw this on eufa site "If the UEFA Champions League holders have qualified for the group stage via their domestic championship, the vacancy will be filled by the champions of the association ranked 11th (Czech Republic)who otherwise compete in the champions path"
@milanmelbourne Did u cheer for napoli win as I did?  I bet 30$ on last corner on kulibaly. I am having a decent lunch tomorrow
@milanmelbourne I hoped u will say coppa wnners qualifies to cl not euro league!  or does it? rules are changing constantly
@milanmelbourne at least he's always said things that we see and feel(chronice milan fans and football understanding fans) I know he wont say samethng he said here in training to lads politely!but he makes mistakes too.either lad's iq is below average or they dont train attack tactics @ all
@milanmelbourne is it possible? how?
@milanmelbourne guys if napoli wins the title and milan win the final. i would give 8/10 to this season. Milan will go to Euroleague stronger and in CL italy will have 4 strong team which is lovely for me as a italian footbal fan...imagine, Napolk, Juve ,Roma and Inter in CL DRAWS...😝
@vwdr13 @RossoneriBlog This may seem crazy but i would swich hakan and bona's position. since the later seems to be better in blocking balls and bona loves himself more in as a winger
@TheCalcioGuy Milik seems like doesnt fit sari's plan...he is so lazy and still
@vwdr13 @RossoneriBlog Oh right says so Mirabelli out
@TheMilanBible I strongly suggest to benevento to make "forzamilan" their slogan

@vwdr13 @RossoneriBlog He is not a super star but given his age and first year at milan he is doing much better than other midfields
@vwdr13 @RossoneriBlog yup

@milanmelbourne I was trolling indeed hhh who else do we have? help me out here man! what is wrong with mighty jack? why he isnt same bona we saw last season?
@ACMilanSydney @MilanNewsit I dont think sosu has more to present. he is been good but not even close to enough. he cant help milan and must be replaced to help playing system. we need an eagle to see forwards well. but if new comer iant good then we will miss him again.the way kalinic made us to miss bacca
@milanmelbourne well apparently 20 years old kessie is doing much better. kessie plays opp.defenders and deposition them to creat space. he runs and pass. bonaventura has been a disaster this season and I am so sad to say it. but I would give monti ro loca his position.
@Sazan_Mandalawi This nation is getting more and more stupid in all aspect. you forgot to mention nargila cafee. on every corner.
@milanmelbourne Guys! please. NO one among this squad isworth watching. they cant play with opponent defence, they dont find each other. they xan shoot or even pass correctly. specially jack and suso + biglia.
@RossoneriBlog You know they should realize in the midfield and forward we need at least one star for each. we dont want 11players. they keep looking for players that come for free or withought headache like rodriguez or hakan. only kessie, bonucci have prooved to be srar.all others are shit
@ACMilanSydney Rodriguez has been his worse, and his shape is one of the reason why we cant score or keep clean sheet.
@ACMilanSydney Biglia has made me to miss montolivio... bona is a disaster. suso full of crap. silva not really a star not even a candle. thing is bona and suso are not playing good enough to be sold for a good price. They will go for free save this tweet.

@milanmelbourne Honestly I try my best but I dont think we can win!
@milanmelbourne And the way we handled aggressive napoli was another + point.
@milanmelbourne I strongly believe we can do that! Even if we dont get CL spot (which is not what this team deserve after losing point vs sassulo) beating juve will bring milan few level closer to where we belong.
@milanmelbourne They will have to sell one of neymar and mpaye... man united already have de gea, barsa ter stegen, man city satified... chelsea courto and juve can kiss dona's ass for some what they can offer.

@ACMilanSydney No! no no no
@milanmelbourne i hate to say this but next season we should hire sari
@ACMilanSydney Exactly. Bonaventura, SUSO, Hakan will not take us anywhere...for kessie I would rather wait more. cutrone as well he is good for sassulo system of 352 not our 433. his style is expired specially now that we dont have pirlo. But silva and kalinic are better. even rodriguez 👎
@milanmelbourne watchkng gattuso for years as a player, I am sure he is stoneheaded coach. 2 days after renewal he let abate play and not borini. he doesnt believe in loca,mussachi(who fucked up the offside plan in sassulo's goal). i am afraid as usual he sometime doesnt think twise
@milanmelbourne He has a mongolian mentality...killing and destroying...that's good in football but come on even carlos or alonso didnt shoot this much😃
@milanmelbourne They are tired. 100% Agree!
@milanmelbourne Hakan shoots too much...
@ACMilanSydney I love milan STRANGELY TOO much to see this shitty players disrespecting its shirt. thouhh not all of them but suprisingly some of their key players.
@ACMilanSydney ❤ of Milan could not be there w/out ❤of Football.Wn I see milan players 40% of times,I see no https://t.co/6TIr4DfHvv I enjoy Rino's shadow over Milan and only bcz its nostalgic. Milan is in healing process but who enjoys wtching a bloody open wound?contin.
@ACMilanSydney @DSportiva Honestly, Rino made two fatal mistakes:playing Abate and NOT PLAYING KALINIC from start!we dont have time to give cutrone to grew up. antoneli could start or borini. WATCHNG ABATE IS SO PAINFUL though i always hope he prove me wrong. bona is cold, hakan shoot alot.kessie low IQ

https://t.co/MkDklIPS9e
@milanmelbourne not just them, but a bit more than others.
@ACMilanSydney Very very bad idea
@milanmelbourne since rino's arrival everyone has improved.Only kessie and bona sometimes disappear. in derby i locked my eyes on kessie and bona as if they havent been fed or paid. not ambitious enough. i'd say same abt sosu but he is currenty all we have as hope. anyway forza milan
@milanmelbourne Coz i am discussing with u, right.
@milanmelbourne Are u kidding right...bonucci, roma,dona,david,biglia and cutrone are from best serie players
@milanmelbourne And i made it clear not out milan but out serie a players...
@milanmelbourne Now u became biased.i am talking about pure and notbiased stats. look at all football, simple stats. no need for philosophy. shots,assist,shots on goal, key passess,successful passes. he is simply below average
@milanmelbourne I dont know what stats u are looking at. but in my stats he is not top20 in assist, shots, shots on rargets, key passes...not even posses and so on! now you tell me,playing for milan in serie a, fighting for CL.does this sounds even good? if so, then go cheer for chievo not milan
@milanmelbourne Same stats sy just opposite! just like u i hope i am wrong
@milanmelbourne Are u kidding me, u like him just as much as i do, but honestly, did he do a great job this season? i eyespot him, he is not the real jack! i know this for fact. even gattuso mentioned it reluctantly. i understand gattuso defending him but I can deny what i see
@ACMilanSydney As long as calabria is ok we wont miss him knwing that borini does fine in his position. wish him quick recovery
@milanmelbourne i cant deny the pressure they had but they had 10 days off! this is football! i imagined jack to be professional not another mesbah. anyway wish to be wrong in next maches
@milanmelbourne are u just an optimist fan or I dont see well?last time i checked my eyes are 6/6. bona is lazy and not creative. we need perotti we need someone who does the job to rush forward. who can be smart and play the whole 90 minutes. bona and kessie and hakan need to be more serious
@Inter_en u will lose to turino save the tweet https://t.co/sB7aALR7OH
@milanmelbourne Milan should have started with gattuso! but no worries. world doesnt end now! although milan finances are more at risk now! if milan can manage to bring some good free agents and make some purchases we can start next year for a a secured CL spot

@ACMilanSydney I think the guy is young and its better not to risk his whole career and give him enough time... we have borini and sadly abate by next year...and he is not our one and only missed character anyway
@ACMilanSydney So apparently he's our next season signing
@MilanEye I hope he starts kalinic or silva and not young cutrone
@MilanEye honestly what we look at is what we see...jack hasnt been himself in midfield for so long. i hope he wakes up

@ACMilanSydney I totally agree with u on that! Sometimes i wonder was it a shoot or a pass! But he is our best now! Every time he gain the ball i gain hope!
@milanmelbourne Believe me, gattuse did see we saw and beyond! ...just wait!
@milanmelbourne Well each match is a new page in history... lads should go there withouth memories. They should make less mistakes and grab any piece of chance.
@hakanc10 @SerieA_TIM @acmilan You did great👏👏👏just pass more
@ACMilanSydney I dont know who has told kessie that he's good in penalty kicks. Today, despite the assist he was shit. But honestly they are tired. No rotations. I hope they rest well kn these 10 days

@ACMilanLBN @EuropaLeague @TeamMilanAC now i get Berlusconi's point about summer spending.bonucci, rodriguez and conti+kessie on loan were only necessary purchases.some could add borini too.

@szamanzadeh بیشتر از اینا باید ببینیم ازش
@ACMilanSydney It must be great to start ur day with 3 points
@milanmelbourne Hakan, monti must be replaced! Bona and kessie need more focus! Locateli should be given more tme! We generally suck at scoring, and not only coz our attackers suck but because midfielders dont make so many lethal chances
@milanmelbourne Come on now! Hakan was not helping...he is not a world class. Bona is one sometimes..kessie needs tme...biglia is a world class. But suso is way better
@milanmelbourne He is the only one with quality in our midfield
@BdairAhmed Well honestly he is the only one with quality.. bona sometimes is shity..hakan is a misunderstanding...kessie is still young

@ACMilanSydney I dont bet at all, a friend of mine does, he asked do u think milan will win?i told him no! He listened to me and won 80$. He said but its ur team and thy're good now. I said they are good but LOGICS come first. I told same guy milan will beat roma, he didnt listen and lost money
@ACMilanSydney This is a fact indeed! But as u said in one of ur twts "love for this team" keeps us hoping and watching.
@ACMilanSydney Well we milanista were addicted to perfection... i hope we go back to that again soon
@ACMilanSydney What do we want? Another sheva? Well no sheva in italia anymore! Not even is england or germany! We need to learn to be a great team, which for numerus reason we are on the right path now. Some players should give it more and some should just pack and leave. Lets have hope
@ACMilanSydney important thing is milan is growing. Arsenal is arsenal. I just saw last 30 mins&amp; I was happy with performance. Players Read the game much BETTER. They have improved. Some dont deserve milan shirt, thise is a fact. But bright side is so telling, that milan is in healing process.
@milanmelbourne @RYOmoha I just want to add one thing, no one actually expects milan to win derbies, classicos and cups and ect in half season! The team has grown technically, menally and tacticly.We also see some individual improvements as wl. A loss with arsenal is not taking aways hopes rino brought

@ACMilanSydney well fassone said, if milan dont go to cl, two top players will leave! now i am asking you, by these result are we going to cl? if yes then something extraordinary should happen for that to happen! if not, why not let coach go and try to keep those top players by changing coach!

@JimCarli I believe it will postpone and hide issues rather than solvining the! The author has no idea why in hell kurds have reached this decision after all! Iraq is gone and belongs to IRAN! At least keeep KRG
@Mikeknightsiraq @WashInstitute Your opinion are stupid, and keep it to yourself! You have never known why we are at this point after all? Dint KRG tried for so long, so many tactics but none worked? So why not let kurds' dreams come to true after all sufferings and bleeding? Shut up or stand for humanity
@HiwaAfandi @Mikeknightsiraq It all talks about what usa has to do for usa's interest! This so called human author doesnt hint kurdish right whatsoever! He accuses barzani to have done the referendum for Politic constituencies at home! He seeks to satisfy ordogan and promise kurds what is no longer vital
@HiwaAfandi @Mikeknightsiraq HOW COULD THEY ASK A NATION TO TAKE BACK THEIR VOTES AND ASK THEIR LEADERS WORK ON SOMETHING THAT WE AIM NOT WHAT YOUR FOLKS HAVE VOTED FOR!
@HiwaAfandi @Mikeknightsiraq Thing is, as as a Kurd and they as politicians havent understoon that we tried! We actually tried, all the ways! But it didnt work! We have been pt enough! And we will move forward for next step and world must have know this by now! A tie pic doesnt make you politican
@HiwaAfandi @Mikeknightsiraq Youknow sir, its is a supid article,read it twice! And I KNOW fo sure this author has no clue why we reach this point at all! All his recomm. Could be helpfull 10 years ago, not now! As our president says, going back to those past stupid negot. is not happening!

@MilanEye @DiMarzio how much we are getting for him?
@MilanEye @DiMarzio sure he is asking petrachi:" how much was milan's offer again?"
@milanmania well at the end of the day any of Morata, aumba, belloti arrive I will be more than happy each for a reason in specific
@milanmania well this is what they should say first
@milanmania no this morning reports said they will only consider a deal more than 100 m
@milanmania according to same reports that say beloti is 100 m. after all that clause is for non italians
@milanmania well morata is 90$, aumbeyang is 100m... if we can get these players cheaper then we can get belotti cheaper too.. if not we get kalinic
@milanmania and believe me, morata may be concrete but aumba talk was only to make cairo ask for less for beloti!at least it was
@milanmania come on, real bought a 16 y player for 45 m cash with no experience at all! all i am saying this is football you never know what will happen
@milanmania that can be applied to aumba case as well! right?
@milanmania coz its 50/50 situation, aumba can arrive and break his leg, beloti can arrive and never shine again! this is what ur saying about beloti
@milanmania what we both agree is that one of them will arrive and will be gr8 any way
@milanmania well since as you said its a "might and might not" situation for beloti, then no one can give a comment.
@milanmania i agree its too much, but all other 2 players are same. unless we pick kalinic for 30-40 m which is another robbery even worse
@milanmania we are going to pay 6 m to a goalie that has had one good season,(50m/4y) why not same for a astriker? this is football. u invest and wait.
@milanmania after all torino may take niang and zapata away from us as part of the deal isnt this a gift itself? hhhh
@milanmania well he has 26goals in 34 apps, with no kaka or kroos or xavi behind him, isnt this enough? and yet hell get 4-5m a year while aumb ask 10
@milanmania well this is my theory... 😎
@milanmania well i agree we should buy experienced ones.
@milanmania I already said any of 3 players arrive will be a win for us.but i love italian strikers and having more than 5 top italians means alot in cl
@milanmania well you right, i am just talking about the bright side, if we fail aumba but sign belotti, we still win... i love aumba myself
@milanmania anfd someone who has already considered a move to china is not ambitious
@milanmania come on he is 28... beloti is 23... well the latter has only one successfull season, i agree with you on this.
@milanmania aumbeyang going to be 29 and only played in bundesliga and liga 1, with very little play in serei a that doesnt count
@milanmania we paid a lot money for bonucci and biglia to get bk on track asap, bt a striker must stay for more than 4 years in top
@milanmania his price...he is going to be. 29 years old who have only played in bundesliga
@milanmania beloti is as expensive as he is, but way younger, better and more importantly italian... they can have their monalisa. next year he is 20 m

@ACMilanSydney congratulationsss💜💜🌷🌷🌻
@ACMilanSydney Mino should learn from his agent and donna should learn from conti...
@MilanEye what a fantastic news
@MilanEye Hurry up please lets clear donna polution
https://t.co/hvBUpEzPTX
https://t.co/ukrx8dHBXG
@MilanEye How is he really?can he compensate that dumbass?
@milanobsession and to try to convince me, Mino all of a sudden thought mabe milan get broken like parma
@milanobsession they also said Mino wanted a cheap clause up to 30 m to release him in case milan fail to qualify to CL. its not even arguable for big Milan
@milanobsession All i am saying is a 18 y. o boy can not question a club. maybe messi could, or ronaldo but not milan academic player
@milanobsession am i talking to mino?
@milanobsession Or belloti for god sake...he has 100 m clause. in a club like torino
@milanobsession all clubs either dont put clauses or set crazy numbers in those clauses...look at neymar contract or asensione next contract
@milanobsession even if they buy bonera shirt it will be more than messi shirt sold all over europe
@milanobsession first person who must have questioned Milan, is Li. and he did and he put everything he has in it. and its china, more than 1 b people
@milanobsession yes they ask for clause, but not for less than 30m, or in case failed to go to cl. its player who tries to take us to cl not club
@milanobsession why wld he even ask? they've given 800 m€, bought 4 players...  for 100m€. wt he wanted to see more? a pic of dona lifting CL cup in future?
@ACMilanSydney FassBeli did what they had to do, give him best possible salary, captain band... rest is mino's crazy game
@milanobsession He asked for irrelevant things...what was he worried of? in worst case senario donna could force milan to sell him when he was 22
@milanobsession its mino who screwed up... when he ask to see list of investors! or to meet the big brother...who asked to meet berlusconi in personal?
@milanobsession Mino took the story to a corner that only one side could win! just be realistic how can a single player 18 y.o doubt Ac milan...
@ACMilanSydney I hope ths relax u. If he decide to go, he is goin to be our objective to deft whereever he go.we los dona he los milan!who should be upset?
@gigiodonna1 if you sack @MinoRaiola you will get our love back and more, if you dont,simply you wont be welcome back in @sansiroofficial.
@milanobsession Fuck you and that fat bastard and his stupid agent.go on and block me. Wehad nothing but pride and love for donna until after announcement
@Pure_Milanista He should do laundry in milanelo for 1 year
@TheMilanBible Thats because they wouldnt offer him bigger than 5 m, you dickhead fat pimp.
@MilanEye what that supposed to mean? not knowing him? mino hypnotised him? his brother is a junk? high? never reads news?
