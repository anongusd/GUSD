How a person spends their time tells you what their priorities are. Trump and his administration spends their time making America safe, secure and economically strong. Democrats spend their time attacking Trump and fighting border security while supporting illegals.
The democratic party supports criminals by giving them sanctuary. They support  cartel through their open borders policy. They support human trafficking rather than ICE by pushing to abolish ICE. Why would any American support democrats.

We need to get rid of all politicians and replace them with real American Patriots with term limits
Blatant racism still lives with in the Democratic Party
After today only lazy, ignorant, greedy, dishonest people would still support the Democratic Party
While Donald Trump is trying to make America great again Democrats are trying to destroy this country
No true American Patriot whatever support the Democratic party after what they saw today during the Michael Cohen hearing
It is a sad day for a veteran such as myself to witness such vulgarity some Democrats who have never served this country a day in their life. They've only served themselves
It is repulsive for an American Patriot such as myself to watch such a Vulgar Display by democrats clearly intense on taking down Donald Trump. They do not care about truth they only care about taking down Donald Trump.
It takes the average intelligent human being about 5 Seconds I'm watching the Democrats hearing before they see the ridiculous biased from Democrats
Some Democrats show clear bias when they use Michael Cohen's first name when addressing him while everyone else uses the formal Mr Cohen.
Today's hearings by the Democrats is a black mark on this country
Would anyone want Michael Cohen as their attorney
With the minimum income bill, Democrats appeal to people who don't want to get of the couch. I believe most Americans want to work so democrats are speaking to a small minority of voters, proving they are out of touch with most Americans.

What Pelosi's Democrats want at the southern border is "virtual" walls. Would anyone want a "virtual" front door on your house?
Trump has very skillfully put Pelosi's Democrats in a corner. Its time to put up or shut up. Either Pelosi was lying to the American public when she said she would invite Trump to the House for the State of the Union or she invites him.
Pelosi's Democrats have voted FOR border walls and funded them in the past so what's changed? Democrats are apparently afraid of Pelosi therefore they refuse to think for themselves. I thought they were elected to act on behalf of the American people not on behave of Nancy Pelosi
Pelosi said she wouldn't invite Trump to the House to deliver a State of the Union until the shutdown was over. Shutdown is over so where is her invitation? She lied!
If we are finally able to get Pelosi's Democrats to negotiate a border wall agreement then its going to beg the question, if now why not before and avoid the shutdown unless that was Pelosi's agenda regardless of how many Americans she hurt.

Mueller's raid on Roger Stone's home was massive. SWAT wearing bullet proof vests swarmed the home as if he was a drug lord. Making matters worst, Mueller's team called CNN to alert them so they could be on site during the raid. Talk about collusion!
Conservative Republicans didn't approve euthanizing unborn babies, liberal democrats did that.
Disgusting politicians in NY say it's ok to kill innocent babies by euthanizing them but it's not ok to euthanize convicted killers. https://t.co/iYqoCwnn3c
Anyone who claims to be for open borders needs to decide which family member you are willing to sacrifice for illegal immigrants. Illegal immigrants kill thousands of Americans every year. The next American to be killed by an illegal immigrant could be your family.
According to democrats, a teenage girl who gets raped is at fault because she wore a provocative dress just as they stated the teens at Covington High School are victims of their own actions by wearing MAGA hats.
@TheJuanWilliams is ridiculously trying to blame the teenagers of Covington High School for being victims of their own actions. He is disgusting and should be fired from @FoxNews .
Liberal media does not care about the facts only their own opinions.
The liberal media has become a joke. When I grew up the media reported the news and allowed the public to make their own opinions. Today the liberal media forces their opinions on the public and ridicules the public who do not agree with them. No facts involved just opinions.
Liberals state that Convington High School students are victims of their own actions because they chose to wear MAGA hats. So banks are victims of bank robbers because of their own actions to open their doors as a bank. Its not the bank robbers fault. That's democrats for you.
Trump and Republicans put forth a resolution to end the shutdown that gives democrats everything they want and more but Pelosi refuses to vote on it to hurt Trump. She is willing to hurt Americans in order to hurt Trump. Schumer is simply Pelosi's puppet.
Venezula is on the brink of a civil war. That is what socialism does. It destroys countries. And that's what democrats want. They ruly want to destroy the America we know today. Obama stated exactly that. And he delivered on that vision. America is not the America I grew up in.
Pelosi and the democrats can end the shutdown in a minute by approving funding for the wall. She is putting illegal immigrants ahead of this country. She wants to continue to allow illegal immigrants to easily pour into this country instead of paying 800,000 federal employees.
Pelosi proves she is not serious about ending the shutdown when she disapproved a bill without even reading it.
Those of you who support the democrats socialist agenda can look to what's going on in Venezula. That's our future if democrats get their way and destroy the free market in America.
After lying about the concern over security for the State of the Union, Pelosi officially uninvites the President from delivering the State of the Union in the House.
Republicans approve a bill that allows all federal employees to be paid during the shutdown but democrats opposed the bill so it did not pass. So don't tell me Pelosi and the democrats care about the 800,000 federal employees who aren't getting paid during the shutdown.

Maybe Pelosi can answer why she and the democrats are fighting so hard to make it easier for illegal immigrants to cross the southern border while 800,000 Americans are laid off as part of the shutdown.
Only two types of people believe Nancy Pelosi's motives are pure, morons and those who have the same far left agenda. If Pelosi's lips are moving she is lying. She is sensing the end of her career.
Republicans want to secure the border and democrats wants a pores border. Republicans want photo ID to prevent voter fraud. Democrats want to allow illegal immigrants to vote. These issues go hand in hand. Democrats are trying to give our country away. Republicans are patriots.
Democrats including freshman congresswoman Ortiz went looking for Senator Mitch McConnell but went to the wrong office. Accused him of being MIA but you have to go to the right office moron. This is the type of idiot the left elects.
Before William Barr is even confirmed Schumer wants him to recuse himself from the witch hunt camouflaged as the Mueller Investigation.
Whether in the Senate, Congress or White House, their first priority is the safety and security of all Americans. Congress is refusing to protect Americans. Pelosi and Schumer refused to meet with Angel Mom's. If they are not going to do their jobs they should resign.
Democrats are not going to work although they expect many government workers to go to work. Americans go to everyday while democrats refuse to go to work.
Nancy Pelosi tries to silence Trump by not inviting him to give the State of the Union from the House. She refuses to negotiate with Trump over the Wall because she knows her agenda will loose. This is about hating Trump not about the securing the border.

@TeamCavuto the difference between Trump's campaign promise to have Mexico pay for the wall and democrats statements in the past in favor of the wall and their position now is Trump never said how he was going to get Mexico to pay for the wall. Democrats no longer want a wall.

@barefootboomer What in the hell does that have to do with anything. More people have been killed by the illegal flow of drugs than wildfires in California. Let that sink in.
Democrats who are against border security are as unpatriotic as I have seen in my life time. You put a front door on your house for security. Why don't you want to secure our borders? Walls work. Support America by calling your congressman and telling them to support the wall.
In 2006, 2009, 2014 and 2018 Democrats voted to build walls at our southern border so what's changed. They hate Trump more than they love America. All of you who voted democrat brought this on America. All of you voted for GOP are responsible for the greatest economy in history.
If Pelosi is saying walls are immoral then she is saying Obama is immoral because he just built a big wall around his home. I guess Israel is immoral with their walls. I guess our embassies around the world are immoral because they all have walls around them. Pelosi is an idiot.

The avg cost of each illegal immigrant is $74K. For every 100,000 illegal immigrants it cost us $7.5B. Where there is a wall, illegal immigration drops by over 90%. The wall would cost less than 5% of what illegal immigrants cost the U.S. Why don't democrats want the wall?

Gilliam is reading straight from the democrats playbook. Lie, slander without facts and accuse, accuse, accuse.
Gilliam's true character is coming through the longer the debate goes on.
All Gilliam seems to be able to do is lie.
Trump has created the greatest economy in over 50 years but Gilliam tries to lie about that fact. We need Trump's economic policies and their success here in Florida. Gilliam slams Trump while Desantis wants to leverage that relationship.
Why would anyone vote for Gilliam. He is going to destroy jobs because he doesn't understand economics or business. Tax cuts create jobs while raising taxes kills jobs and that is what Gilliam has promised he is going to do.
Gilliam is against the 2nd amendment. That is why his city has one of the highest crime rates in the state. Higher than Miami and Orlando. He thinks the NRA is responsible. #VoteRed2018
Gilliam is a socialist who refuses to denounce Bernie Sanders and his socialist policies.
Gilliam refuses to work with law enforcement. Wants to abolish ICE.
Gilliam is a broken record as he lies about the pictures of illegal immigrants and their children that was debunked as pictures from the Obama administration.
Gilliam actually thinks that obstructing the efforts of law enforcement is doing their job.
Gilliam lied about the FBI investigation while the facts were running across the bottom of the screen. #VoteDeSantis

@CChristineFair is representative of the stereotypical left wing democratic party. The bible says avoid evil associations. That is why I'm a Republican.
Democrats say it is not about whether Kavanaugh is guilty, its about being accused. Simply being accused means someone's life should be destroyed. Democrats are horrible ppl. Their platform doesn't even protect the sanctity of life.
Democrats believe due process only applies to people applying for certain jobs. Ford didn't answer one question definitively but democrats say she wad credible. Even a simple question, who drove you home. Ford's answer, I don't know. She was pitiful.

Lie detector was conducted on August 7th. Report was given to Democrats on August 10th. Democrats waited until yesterday, September 26th, to give it to Republicans. #ConfirmKavanaughNow
Ford has been lying about her fear of flying. The reason this hearing was postponed to today was to allow Ford to drive from CA to Washington. Mitchell has uncovered that Ford doesn't have any fear of flying. If she lied about something so simple what else is she lying about.
If the Democrats truly wanted an investigation they would have brought these accusations to light back in July instead of at the eleventh hour before Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing. #ConfirmKavanaughNow
Ford has disputed she told her therapists there were 4 attackers not 2. Although her therapists confirms Ford told her there were 4 attackers. Just another contradiction between her stories. #ConfirmKavanaughNow

Grassley is going over the facts from July to now. Feinstein never asked Kavanaugh about the allegation either privately or during the hearing. Ford was treated shamelessly by Democrats. #ConfirmKavanaughNow

If Feinstein wanted people to take this letter seriously, she should have handled it responsibly. Now she has made a mockery of the confirmation process and even Christine Ford's allegations. Every reasonable American voter sees through this charade. #voterepublican2018
Feinstein is perhaps one of the most dishonest women in politics. She held on to a letter over 2 months that she now wants the FBI to investigate as a credible allegation. Disgusting tactic if she thinks a letter accusing an honorable man is going to be taken seriously. #votegop https://t.co/PQNcJtgmgW
The FBI does not have the manpower to open an investigation on every letter they receive were a woman is alleging sexual assault 30 something years ago. Especially when the accuser can't recall basic details like what year it happened our even where it happened. #voterepublican
If Christine Ford wanted to remain anonymous and she only sent a letter to Feinstein then she forwarded the letter to the FBI so one of them leaked the letter. #voterepublican2018

Obama is back to his old rhetoric apologizing for America. Name calling. And patting himself on the back for someone else's accomplishments. No former president has ever behaved this way. Now he is Deplorable.
Americans need to ask themselves a "what if". What if Republicans had treated Obama the way Democrats are treating Trump. What if conservatives behaved like liberals. Imagine it.
Obama proves why I never voted for him. He is still complaing that Bush caused Obama's failures but takes credit for all of Trump's successes. Pitiful display of someone trying to be relevant. Shows desperation of democrats.

@RedbeardDave84 @HayleyWelsh Slavery became a talking point but it was not the seed that the Civil War grew from. The KKK then preverted the Confederate flag in to their symbol. I realize hate can turn any symbol in to something divisive. Civil rights movement in the 60s reignited the debate over the flag.
@HayleyWelsh @RedbeardDave84 Based upon your responses I'm trying to read between the lines. Instead, I'd rather know straight from you what your position is and how you came to your opinions.
@RedbeardDave84 @HayleyWelsh I agree. I still have my opinion but ultimately it is a woman's decision. Although I  may not agree with abortion, my compassion for her is first and foremost. If a man robs a bank to feed his family, I don't agree with robbing banks but I do have compassion for why he did.
@HayleyWelsh @RedbeardDave84 Check again. I already responded. My mom was faced with the tough decision you described and it was before Roe vs Wade. I believe it becomes a medical decision when survival is at question.
@RedbeardDave84 @HayleyWelsh Check your history books. Southerners sought to succeed from the United States for the same reason the Colonies succeeded from British rule. Northerners were using our taxes to build their cities not southern cities.
@HayleyWelsh This is the more adopted and widespread definition... https://t.co/ET74m8nEl3
@RedbeardDave84 @HayleyWelsh Serving in the military is exactly why I have such strong feelings about killing. Life is precious. This world no longer seems to value human life and that to me is sad. Life begins at conception.  Period! God doesn't deal in technicalities.
@RedbeardDave84 @HayleyWelsh I would certainly hope those who care for her would counsel her on how to turn something good out of something so horrific. Adoption is better than abortion. Although I don't believe in abortion, I certainly have compassion and understand how she could choose abortion.
@HayleyWelsh Ditto
@RedbeardDave84 @HayleyWelsh Listening to you makes me even prouder to be an American. We have our issues but we are still the greatest country on the planet. BTW, check your liberal fake news on school shootings before quoting them as fact.
@HayleyWelsh You labeled me a redneck simply because I'm from the south. That's putting me in a group because of where I live. Redneck is not a term of endearment. Talking with you does shine a light on why this country is so divided.
@RedbeardDave84 @HayleyWelsh Marriage between a man and woman is my belief because God commanded it but if someone wants to marry a tree then go for it. Its not for me to judge. As for the bible covering abortion. How about "Thou shall not kill".
@RedbeardDave84 @HayleyWelsh Seriously. I'm a proud southerner. Check your history books. Civil war  began about taxation. Confederate flag represents those opposing taxation without representation. Racists made it about race.
@HayleyWelsh I'm not intolerant of your views, I simply disagree. However, it seems you lean towards intolerance and you like to put ppl in groups based upon where they live or their opinions. You might want to check your discrimination and bigotry at the door.
@HayleyWelsh According to you, I'm a bigot because I believe marriage is between a man &amp; woman and I'm a Christian. You believe all southerners are rednecks. Bigot is defined as intolerant of another person's opinion. Discrimination is making a distinction against me because I'm a southerner.

@HayleyWelsh I'm curious what prompted the nasty racist and bigoted redneck comment. If you leaped to that because I'm proud to be a southerner then your narrow minded view makes you racist. Your intolerance makes you a bigot. I take the gun toting and bible thumping as a compliment.
@HayleyWelsh @chughes1964ch @JohnCleese Anyone who refers to a beautiful creation like that of an unborn child as a parasite tells me a lot about the person making the reference. It's a disgusting comparison. I  sorry you have such a sad view of life.

@HayleyWelsh Now I understand who I am talking with. According to you if I don't support abortion I'm a gun toatin, bible bashing, racist, bigoted redneck. Liberals always seem to insult those who don't agree with them. And the discussion was not about childbirth. üá∫üá∏üìñ‚úå
@HayleyWelsh @chughes1964ch @JohnCleese Absolutely not! My mom had to make that exact decision before Roe vs Wade. It was a medical decision not a decision of convenience as many are.
@EaronnScot @ryangreenaway @DragonflySon @JohnCleese I demand nothing of others. I do wish ppl would believe in something greater than themselves and choose life over death. A medical decision to save the life of the mother or the child is not the cause of the majority of abortions. The right decision isn't always the easiest.
@EaronnScot @ryangreenaway @DragonflySon @JohnCleese Mentally ill! If you are insinuating the friends you've buried was due to suicide because of the "great event" in their life of an unwanted pregnancy that was a choice they made. A horrible choice just as abortion is.  America has lost its way.
@HayleyWelsh @chughes1964ch @JohnCleese It's a living being at conception. Heart beat after 18 days. Obama signed a bill that children who survived a botched abortion shouldn't receive medical care so they will die because that's the mother's wish. It's insane and inhumane!
@EaronnScot @ryangreenaway @DragonflySon @JohnCleese I am an organ donor. You throw out numbers with no facts. Typical liberal. You'd have to track how many ppl could have been saved with either a blood transfusion or organ donation versus how many babies are slaughtered every year.
@EaronnScot @ryangreenaway @DragonflySon @JohnCleese I'm not forcing anyone not to get an abortion but if you want me to say is ok that's not going to happen. I've seen first hand what has happened to women who had abortions. Mentally they are never the same. I'd rather women choose life over death.
@sjmc1974 @chughes1964ch @JohnCleese That is one of the most ridiculous things I've heard from the left in a long time. So what you are saying is that being a blue collar worker could kill you.

@Data_Jack I think you are misinformed. Conservatives are for preventing unwanted pregnancies. We want to prevent rape and incest. We want to educate people on abstanance as well as contraceptives. It's liberals who want to avoid the subject of abstanance.
@EaronnScot @ryangreenaway @DragonflySon @JohnCleese Is it ok for someone to rob a bank as long as it's to feed their family? Having a child that was conceived as a result of rape is a choice. Two wrongs don't make a right. Why not give the child up for adoption? If killing the baby is not punishing the unborn baby then what is it?
@Go_Robot_Go @DragonflySon @JohnCleese The majority of Americans elected Obama which was a disaster. If you go with the masses your destiny is left up to them. How about be a free thinker.
@TConabike @DragonflySon @JohnCleese You apparently missed his point.
@S_Casteran @DragonflySon @JohnCleese You completely missed Ronald Reagan's point! It's easy to be for something that doesn't affect you directly! There are people on death row who support the death penalty.
@AKA_Porlek @DragonflySon @JohnCleese People who choose to have abortions in unsafe conditions made that choice. It's called suffering the consequences of your actions. I realize Obama's legacy is that we aren't responsible for our actions but  that's not how life works. Choices have consequences!
@ryangreenaway @DragonflySon @JohnCleese Seriously, that's your comeback. Why is a child who was conceived due to horrific circumstances any less deserving to live than a child that was conceived through love? You are punishing the unborn child for something he/she had no control over.
