I don’t like people creepily taking pictures of congresscritters and staff eating burgers, etc. I also don’t like progressive activists yelling and chasing people out of restaurants. A lot of people upset at the former are ok with the latter.  That’s the real problem.
@jpodhoretz They are very unpleasant.  But for a nation that now loves watching train wrecks, it fits the bill.
Congressional hearings make for great TV, but no one is going to change their mind on any of this based on Michael Cohen.  Congress would actually serve the nation better by getting rid of TV cameras and actually doing their jobs.
