@ckuck The reason enforcement has minimal to no impact on undocumented immigrant effects on outcomes (crime, jobs, etc) is because undocumented immigrants pump more into the economy then they take, not eligible for social benefits (except some for DACA), and do not increase crime rates

@OPlz @technokrat233 @LeonHWolf I dont expect everyone to agree with a reasonable, humanistic, kind, logical, feasible, and data-based approach to immigration. It is okay for you and I to disagree. I‚Äôm not an angry person. I will always message positively on my platform. Let‚Äôs have civil conversations. D and R
@OPlz @technokrat233 @LeonHWolf This has been good productive discussion Alex. But I have to rest. Have a good night. Remember, always, always- choose kind first. God takes care of the rest.
@OPlz @technokrat233 @LeonHWolf I have asked for funding from the audacious project by TED. 45 MM over 5 years. privately funded. If not, I‚Äôll do it for cheaper, but slower.
@OPlz @technokrat233 @LeonHWolf Alex. I haven‚Äôt called you names. Name calling is not for you. Stay calm. No country has open borders. We can work with other countries to defer others to other countries. You have not proposed a plan yet. Yet, I have.
@OPlz @technokrat233 @LeonHWolf Well. it‚Äôs not my claim. it‚Äôs data based. it‚Äôs not mine, I dont run meta-analyses of longitudinal socioeconomic data. Pew Research and others do. They publish it. it‚Äôs publicly available.
@OPlz @technokrat233 @LeonHWolf I agree. we do need a process. Violating human rights and traumatizing children shouldn‚Äôt be a part of it.
@OPlz @technokrat233 @LeonHWolf I am all for strict borders. I‚Äôm not sure how that will be accomplished. People flee poverty. It‚Äôs not right to turn them ALL away. It‚Äôs akin to the sinking boat scene in the titanic. I‚Äôm for a vetted process. 1986 amnesty was absolutely vetted. I was there.
@OPlz @technokrat233 @LeonHWolf No nation is taking on 7 billion people worldwide. We‚Äôre talking about 11 MM max. That‚Äôs 3.4% of the 315 MM Americans or so. it‚Äôs minute. I‚Äôm not for open borders, just vetted and kind ones.
@OPlz @technokrat233 @LeonHWolf Then. I plan on collecting longitudinal data on immigrants to show ‚Äúwhat are they up to‚Äù on many variables: jobs, crime, paying taxes, etc. Then we can have data-based discussions and develop policy based on objective measures and not subjective emotion and fear.
@OPlz @technokrat233 @LeonHWolf Not at all. you‚Äôll see when my documentary comes out. It‚Äôs data driven. undocumented immigrants do not negatively impact jobs, economy, crime. Pew research, Cato Institute, Migration Policy Institute data.
@OPlz @technokrat233 @LeonHWolf Actually not everyone. People don‚Äôt want to leave their homes. My half brother is there now, he‚Äôll be a physician next year. No interest in coming here. We only left because my mother was fighting for equal pay and rights for women. Not all Salvadorans we‚Äôre doing that.
@OPlz @technokrat233 @LeonHWolf Fair enough. What do you propose? Propose something that‚Äôs feasible, reasonable, and fiscally attainable.
@OPlz @technokrat233 @LeonHWolf Alex. These folks are taking huge risks. It is not to get a job to buy a car. It is because they‚Äôre fleeing violence for one reason or another. Also, we are supposed to be the beacon of light. God protects the righteous. This country used to be a role model in many ways.
@OPlz @technokrat233 @LeonHWolf Well. this would require a longer convo. Our economy is strong and wouldn‚Äôt become 3rd world, that is economy driven. You‚Äôd have to show me economic data to support that it‚Äôs costing the EU. I only engage in data-based discussions, not emotional ones based on what media shows.
@OPlz @technokrat233 @LeonHWolf Civil war in our country didn‚Äôt qualify. In other words, they didn‚Äôt want more central americans in the US.
@OPlz @technokrat233 @LeonHWolf Not at all. Have you read what I propose? vetted amnesty for productive immigrants. See my website mission statement.
@OPlz @technokrat233 @LeonHWolf I understand about practical. However, it‚Äôs not christian to not help the ‚Äòforeigner‚Äô or ‚Äòalien‚Äô. We didn‚Äôt stay in Mexico because it was not safe at the time. See my story at https://t.co/WYijQcGNmg No one has more of a human right to an affluent part of the world over another.
@OPlz @technokrat233 @LeonHWolf Don‚Äôt assume Alex. We were denied political asylum in 1981. Even though my mother and sibling and I received death notices from the Salvadoran government.
@OPlz @technokrat233 @LeonHWolf I understand about it being ‚Äòlegal‚Äô but not all that is legal is kind or just. I always try to choose kind. stern but kind.
@RealJamesWoods @OPlz I bet if we chatted and you got to know me, you‚Äôd not think I was ‚Äúillegal‚Äù or an ‚Äúalien‚Äù. I ran across the border at 7 years old, running from death threats in El Salvador. For your review and education Mr. Woods: https://t.co/3aphVtTmwv
