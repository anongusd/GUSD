Join us for our next event Thursday January 24th at 6:00pm at Lordstown High School.  Help us fight for the future of Lordstown!
If you haven't written a letter to GM already - now is the time.  Please visit https://t.co/1THuOIHc2B and the International UAW will be printing and personally hand delivering your message to our "friends" at GM headquarters.
"We have been part of the GM family for 53 years and we are ready for the next 53. We are optimistic that the meeting between you and Gov. Mike DeWine will demonstrate the state's commitment to a partnership that works for General Motors and keeps everyone working."
“We want everybody to see that we’re united together to fight this decision, and we want them to build their vehicles in the United States. Not China, not Mexico.”
Congressman Tim Ryan invited UAW 1112's President Dave Green to be his guest at the State of the Union address. #driveithomeohio #savegmlordstown #gmlordstown #savelordstown 	https://t.co/W3caZRvraF

General Motors is reporting record profits, yet CEO Mary Barra can't use a small fraction of those profits to invest in Lordstown, invest in good manufacturing jobs, and invest in American workers? Shame. https://t.co/ETu9eKBtAa
General Motors CEO Mary Barra should read every single last letter that we sent to her from students in Mahoning and Trumbull county school districts. https://t.co/xASBxIhKlT
“You guys can count on me, through thick and thin, as long as I’m breathing. ... I’m always going to fight for Lordstown," said Rich Rankin, the UAW Region 2-B director. https://t.co/kJ5QHQeBA5
"The parties will provide eligible seniority laid-off and active seniority employees an opportunity to relocate to UAW-GM facilities outside of their area, with particular emphasis on placing employees from closed or idled facilities" https://t.co/BoQ5pDh8Hc
"Alleging breach of contract, the UAW is asking the court to order GM to stop using the temps in Fort Wayne and transfer union members to the plant." https://t.co/0b5IGOOPIY
Support for the workers in Lordstown and our efforts to save the Lordstown GM plant is pouring in from all over. https://t.co/6f3OeaJ4We
The Lordstown plant closing will have a ripple effect all across the valley. https://t.co/GgEw1nXRfV
“We should be building the next-generation car here,” Allein said. “We should be building the crossovers here, not in Mexico.” https://t.co/CSyBXDGNXp
Read the letter sent to General Motors CEO Mary Barra by Senators Sherrod Brown and Rob Portman. https://t.co/8uhyYifnuF
If the Lordstown complex closes the ripple effect will affect thousands of workers and families across the Valley. https://t.co/fuUkhLthbR
"Mary Barra ought to take the time to read these letters and really think about how her decisions will affect thousands of workers and their families in the Valley," said Dave Green, President of UAW Local 1112. https://t.co/qAQWwt0Plh
The letters and drawings are in! Over 5,000 students in Mahoning and Trumbull county participated and told GM CEO Mary Barra their holiday wish: for GM Lordstown to stay open. https://t.co/YzmP1X3X6c
"General Motors loves to put out numbers, these many jobs, these many people but behind every number is a face and in this case, it's the faces of children," said UAW 1112 Vice-President Tim O'Hara. https://t.co/PL73Xnb2fO
"Council President Jim Graham, a former president of UAW Local 1112, told the standing-room-only crowd, 'We just want to let you know we are behind you 150 percent, every municipality in the area, because we know the importance of this plant to the area.'" https://t.co/vi4akI95Jg
When the first Chevrolet Impala sedan rolled off the line at General Motors' plant in Lordstown, Ohio, on April 28, 1966, Lyndon Johnson was president.	Sixteen million vehicles later, the Lordstown plant could be deserted. https://t.co/XrMaNCwXHY
"There are between 580 and 1,100 companies in Ohio that are in one way or another considered part of the automotive supply chain" and all their workers will be affected. https://t.co/wl1LE5v5dO
“We love this community; we love this area,” said Andrew Villers, pointing out his Chevy Cruze in the parking lot. The pay is good — most workers make more than $30 an hour — and the region benefited. “This area has stayed alive because of us.” https://t.co/aaXQIKlDPf
"Just as the workforce has stood with General Motors over the years, we expect GM to stand with these workers — and give them a chance," Portman told reporters after the meeting. https://t.co/yzoo2syAK8
Watch this video of Senator Sherrod Brown commenting on the situation in Lordstown and providing solutions to bring manufacturing jobs back to  the States and back to Ohio. https://t.co/HIMsPv2yq8
Mary Barra is the 4th most powerful woman in the world. She has the power to #SaveLordstown and keep manufacturing jobs in America. Will she support the families in the Valley, Ohio and the U.S. that have supported her and GM when she needed them? https://t.co/L1BLF9lvzF
Please join us as we fight to keep the GM Lordstown complex up and running. We need to increase manufacturing in the U.S., not outsource jobs and hurt American workers. #SaveLordstown https://t.co/QhaVjK7bpn
Progress. Hopefully Senators Portman and Brown can have a productive conversation with GM CEO Mary Barra and convince her that keeping the Lordstown plant up and running is the right choice for her company and the right choice for the Valley. https://t.co/8QRDtzgg3Z
“It’s so cold. But there’s nothing to block us — rain or cold,” said Ms. Walker, 58, who said she’s worked at the plant for 12 years and was laid off a few months ago — a tough situation for the mother of two children in college. https://t.co/3O1njZoch9
UAW Region 2B Director Rich Rankin talks about how to get involved in our effort to convince General Motors to invest in us. We have invested for years in General Motors. https://t.co/LhVTA3JZTZ

The Drive It Home Ohio campaign is alive and kicking. We will work to convince GM to grow jobs in the Mahoning Valley, protect manufacturing in Ohio and make sure American-made cars and trucks are Made in America.
@mattdebord Drive It Home Ohio would like to send you a statement for your story about the GM announcement. Where should we send it? If you want to private message, follow us.
Vindicator: The “Drive It Home” campaign is designed to show (GM CEO Mary) Barra and members of her inner circle that assigning a new product to Lordstown to replace the Cruze makes good business sense.		It would be foolhardy for GM to mothball the plant. https://t.co/ebiQz5QmxW
