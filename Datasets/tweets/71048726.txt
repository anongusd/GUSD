All of Russia is on vacation until the 11th, but when they return, expect Paul Whelan's arrest video to surface on Russian state TV as a juicy spy, America-sucks expose.
The weirdest thing about the Paul Whelan detention is still the muted response from the U.S. government, including Pompeo's statement that "if the detention is not appropriate, we will demand his immediate return." https://t.co/uJ5rBUzCFi
(Doesn't mean that Whelan is not a spy, but just something to keep in mind.)
About Paul Whelan and the thumb drive: the Russian police and secret services are notorious for planting evidence on suspects. Drugs, explosive materials, etc.
@KevinRothrock @NatVasilyevaAP Well, no. They're kind of the opposite, I'd say. Petrov &amp; Boshirov were "gay," therefore they could not be spies bc spies aren't gay. Whelan doesn't like the ladies, which means he's a spy because any normal man would be hitting up the ladies‚Äîunless he's a spy.
Reader, it gets better: ‚ÄúWhat stood out,‚Äù Rosbalt says, ‚Äúwas that Whelan wasn‚Äôt at all interested in pretty Russian girls, and preferred to spend his time drinking with male friends from the Internet.‚Äù

Again, this is how Russian journalists tend to die: they get in the way of someone's business interests (Wagner has an oil deal in Syria). As this case shows, the most dangerous business interests, though, are the ones that overlap with Putin's geopolitical objections.
In April, another Russian journalist who had been investigating Wagner fell from his window a day after he saw men in special forces uniforms casing his apartment. Today's killings bring the tally to 4 dead journalists.
Wagner's mercenaries also staged a daring attack on U.S. special forces in Syria a couple months ago, and were obliterated. Moscow quickly brushed this under the rug.
Wagner, which has sent Russian mercenaries to Ukraine, Syria, Sudan, and CAR, is owned by Putin "chef," Evgeny Prigozhin. He also owns the Internet Research Agency, aka the Troll Factory. He was sanctioned by US Treasury in March 2018.
I knew Orhan Dzhemal. He was a fearless, thorough reporter who knew his subject matter‚Äîthe insurgencies of the North Caucasus‚Äîinside out. He was a consummate professional, and a generous colleague. What a loss.

The point is, the Manafort-Kilimnik bond smelled to high heaven, in part because of their shady connections to Deripaska and god knows who else in Moscow‚Äîas I have reported. But let‚Äôs stick to the facts and not trample all nuance. Not all dots connect.
Moreover, this was just two years after the US toppled Saddam Hussein over Putin‚Äôs objections. By 2005, it was natural for Putin to assume that Bush, who loved Reaganesque democracy promotion, was coming for him next. And he didn‚Äôt Kilimnik to leak him this either.
Moreover, Patrushev‚Äôs 2005 speech came after three pro-democratic revolutions had swept pro-Moscow leaders from power in three former Soviet republics. They correctly suspected that US government-backed organizations had provided support to these movements.
It is literally on their website. https://t.co/9UqXYzC0HL
As @maddow herself pointed out, Reagan announced ~in 1982~ that this is what the US government would be doing: countering Moscow by promoting democracy through organizations like NED, NDI, and IRI. This was IRI‚Äôs mission from day 1. The FSB didn‚Äôt need Kilimnik to leak it to them
One thing I didn‚Äôt get to say on air: even if Konstantin Kilimnik was a plant in the IRI meeting in Slovakia, this piece really does not prove that this is how the FSB found out that IRI was promoting democracy. Why? Because that is literally all IRI has ever done.

Allow me to clarify: Aaron Schlossberg is a vicious racist who deserves to be pilloried as such. As a refugee from a totalitarian country, and a student of its authoritarian heir, I find the mob unsettling even if it‚Äôs a mob whose motives I agree with.
@fivefifths He‚Äôs an asshole. A hateful, racist asshole who verbally harassed people. On this we agree.
@CTowersCBS I do not. And I don‚Äôt know what that‚Äôs like. I myself am an immigrant and a refugee, though, and found what he said disgusting and horrifying.
Aaron Schlossberg doesn‚Äôt seem like a very nice person, but does that merit harassing him in the street, kicking him out of his work space, having people trying to revoke his legal license? Imagine this happening to someone you agree with and see how you feel.

In other words, there are no oligarchs who are not "close" to Putin. They do't exist. All wealthy people in Russia have to pay some level of fealty to the Kremlin or they don't keep their money.
Oligarchs who do *not* play by Putin's rules are either no longer oligarchs or live outside Russia. But playing by Putin's rules does not indicate proximity to or affection for him. He's their black jack dealer.
A friend who worked with Vekselberg called him "ruthless, like all the other oligarchs."
PSA: Friends in the American media, please stop using the phrase "an oligarch close to Vladimir Putin." It's a meaningless phrase. There are oligarchs who were Putin's childhood friends and old KGB guys, and then there are oligarchs who play by the rules to keep their money.
And then there was that partnership with the Alfa Bank guys and BP, in which Vekselberg was rumored to have worked with the FSB to push BP out of Russia.
Vekselberg also ran Skolkovo, a Russian government-run Silicon Valley-type project, which was widely seen a massive boondoggle.
And then there was the time that Vekselberg tried to buy Gawker, which struck everyone as super weird at the time. https://t.co/9vI2mm9svg

The other question: is this a slow drawing of a new iron curtain? This is something liberal Russians have been fearing since the beginning of Putin‚Äôs revanche in 2012, that their country would close itself off from the West and they would get stuck, unable to travel.
In some ways, this is like Putin‚Äôs counter-sanctions: the loss of imported cheese and prosciutto affected those who could afford them, and those people are often not Putin supporters.
One of the main casualties of the diplomatic tit-for-tat is Russians trying to get American visas. American consulates in the region are swamped and Russians are having to cancel their plans. These are the most pro-American Russians. Coincidence?

Unfortunately, the president's attacks on the transatlantic order have only fed into liberals' fetishization of Europe as the more civilized place. As a Jew, this has always made me uncomfortable. Europe has been able to be at peace after being successfully ethnically cleansed.
Just discussing what's happening in France and Britain with a friend, who said "It's not a good time to be a Jew in Europe right now." But really, when was it ever a good time to be a Jew on the continent that invented ethno-nationalism and systematized ethnic cleansing?

Humanity aside, let's say an immigrant family needs some help getting on their feet when they first get here. Then they get on their feet, get good jobs and start paying into the system, far more than they ever took from it. We're willing to forgo that money just to make a point?
