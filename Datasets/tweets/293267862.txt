#ClowardPivenStrategy This overwhelmed the systems the US had in place to deal with migrant children, to the point where Border Patrol had to keep children in temporary facilities on military bases.
also 10/2013-9/2014 saw a rapid increase in number of parents arriving with young children. In fact, nearly as many family units (68,445) were apprehended at the border as unaccompanied children ‚Äî  over 3Xs as many families as were apprehended the previous year
After 2011, the US saw a rapid increase in unaccompanied children crossing into the US illegally  most from Central America.Between October 2013-September 2014, 68,541 unaccompanied children were apprehended at the US/Mexico border‚Äî a 77% increase over the previous year.

some parents and doctors say #CDC is not doing enough to address the malady. Many doctors believe the paralysis is caused by a summer virus and that the CDC‚Äôs decision to continue to call AFM a ‚Äúmystery‚Äù illness is wrongly stoking fears among parents, coverup?
‚ÄúI think people like me continue to believe that the majority ‚Ä¶ of these cases are linked to enterovirus D-68 infection,‚Äù said Dr. Kenneth Tyler, a neurologist at the University of Colorado who led the mouse study. ‚ÄúThe CDC has been, I think, exceedingly cautious.‚Äù coverup?

These children were housed for long periods of time under crowded conditions before they were relocated. The possibility certainly exists that some of these children if not infected by EV-D68 before they came here, could have acquired the infection while being sheltered.
cases of EV-D68 originally occurred, at least on a county basis (as the relocation of the children has only been disclosed on state/county level) in accordance to where these children were relocated
