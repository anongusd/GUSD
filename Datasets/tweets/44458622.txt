Union leaders are calling on MNA to stop its raid on SEIU nurses at Mercy, because it violates union values, wastes resources &amp; could endanger the labor movement. See this letter from Pres of Teamsters Local 332 &amp; Director of the Healthcare Division to @minurses. #SEIUNurseStrong https://t.co/sSfZoLeiXo
SEIU members just won a major victory to protect Mercy Health employees‚Äô health care discount benefit! Once again, we‚Äôve proven that SEIU members have a superior contract and the strongest enforcement. Here‚Äôs the official email from Mercy to SEIU. #SEIUNurseStrong https://t.co/jUhwhZuXmD
Mercy RNs have been able to win our superior contract because of the strength of the 80,000 member SEIU Nurse Alliance, 1 million healthcare professionals nationally in SEIU and 1,000 technical and service colleagues throughout our hospital! #SEIUNurseStrong https://t.co/xubmVrfwKN
"I worked at Hackley for 7 years and just transferred to the Mercy Campus, so I know the clear difference between MNA and SEIU firsthand, and it's like night and day. SEIU nurses have a superior contract and we enforce it much more strongly.‚Äù -Amber Rupe, RN, BSN #SEIUNurseStrong https://t.co/e5NKPqxv6Q

‚ÄúThe SEIU Nurse Alliance is of, by and for nurses. We banned mandatory overtime in CA and won safe needles nationally. I‚Äôve been an RN for 35 years and SEIU is the most effective voice for nurses."	-Dian Palmer, RN, BSN	@SEIU73 President &amp; former Nurse Alliance Executive Director https://t.co/IWLzYvGUTT
"There's strength in numbers and when we're all united we have much more leverage with management because they can't run the hospital without the entire team. Let's protect our strong, united voice in SEIU!"-Sherrie Samp, Medical Technologist, Mercy Health, 26 years of service https://t.co/LLWyhUTESw

Know what #momsdontneed this #MothersDay? Pregnancy discrimination, which is	a harsh reality for too many. Congress, pass the #PWFA!
#Momsdontneed the uncertainty that unpredictable scheduling practices create.	We all need more control and stability. #SchedulesThatWork
Congress, #momsdontneed lip service. They need the #PaycheckFairness Act to	combat harmful pay discrimination: https://t.co/mqaemNCV9P
#Momsdontneed a punishing #wagegap. Moms need #fairpay and a	#minimumwage increase. #MothersDay #FightFor15
Instead of helping workers, H.R. 1180 would allow employers to delay paying	overtime. That‚Äôs what #momsdontneed. #lesstimelesspay #comptime
#Momsdontneed false promises like the Working Families Flexibility Act. We need	#paidsickdays and #paidleave! #comptime #lesstimelesspay
Choosing between a child‚Äôs health and a paycheck is exactly what	#momsdontneed. This #MothersDay and beyond, moms need #paidsickdays.
Moms are key breadwinners and caregivers, and yet most are not guaranteed	#paidleave. https://t.co/OSK9hkuyzA #MomsDontNeed
#Momsdontneed a system that forces them to choose between their health or	families and a job. We need national #paidleave. #FAMILYAct now!
