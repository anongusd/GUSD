Everybody plays dirty but the dirtier doesn't always win. There is somebody up there, guiding, controlling destinies.
Have havens ever fallen because of a shutdown drama in Washington? Life goes on. https://t.co/ipCMiGuKZP

@Ram_Guha @RaisinaSeries Where is the threat? Are you saying nobody should criticise you at all?
@chrisinsilico @BBCPolitics Probably some are able to impact opinions in dubious manners. But the basic willingness to be moulded has to be there. People's opinion must be respected. Always.

@DebbieOConnor4 @djrothkopf @MaxBoot You not bothered about the poor people in the US? You are more concerned about those in other countries? Strange.
It seems India better than US. There every journalist seems to be either a Democrat or Republican. In India we still have some who at least try to remain objective. Bharat Mata ki Jai.
@djrothkopf @MaxBoot People all over the world are beginning to realise globalisation has only ended up corporatising everything. So they are expressing anger where they can. In US they elected Trump. In France it has started. Merkel ...
@MollyJongFast Even weather can't suppress or lift one's mood always. It is He who decides every moment of your life. Doesn't mean you don't work or try.
@AshaRangappa_ Why do all US TV channels align with either Dems or Reps? Why can't they be objective. Scenario less bad in India.

RT @AMike4761: Angela Merkel: Trump Has Almost Destroyed The 'New World Order' -  Hey, that’s why we hired him you horrible globalist cow!…
TV channels are treating exit polls as final results. Wait. Some surprises may be there in store.
@PiyushGoyal @SureshNakhua Just wondering if spending power of target audience has ever received attn when deciding on these CIRCUITS.
@James_KSA Not at all. I still support him. I feel anguished about his refusal to ignore US educated economists who are total illiterates, far as Indian economy is concerned. Latest appt of CEA is the same. Booth School ...
Real inflation adjusted income of the bottom quintile in US has remained unchanged since 1970, In India it has gone down.

@DrKumarVishwas You are a very competent man who generally thinks objectively. Salute.
Can BJP still make it in LS2019? Depends. But certainly not on Ram Mandir or illegal immigrants. Shuffling of economic priorities is the key.

Saying people are short-sighted is the most foolish statement anyone can make at this juncture.
Outcome in MP, Chattisgarh will also be quite decisive. Unless priorities are reshuffled, little hope for LS2019.
France needs to tax fuel guzzling heavy cars and not fuel to finance renewables. Applies to India also.

@suchetadalal Bank A in France sends USD money to Bank B in New York for remittance to Bank C in India for an individual beneficiary. Can Bank B bring USD money to India, pay it to Bank D and ask it to convert it, send INRs to Bank C for the individual beneficiary? Do RBI rules allow that?

What the hell is wrong with simple monetised deficit, i.e. expanding money supply. What matters is what you spend it on. India needs monetised deficit of 10 lakh cr for three years in a row.
@Raghav_Bahl Monetised deficit doesn't mean printing currency. Why are you twisting the whole thing?

BJP needs to understand one simple fact to get the economy right: India is made more of sane savings than insane earnings and this isn't about to change. @arunjaitley @PMOIndia
@rij79 The MD spoke almost exclusively to the Swiss, ignoring the Indian GM. That Swiss was actually not clear about even tech features of the loom. I have personally had similar experiences.
@rij79 The complex I am talking about goes far beyond wearing dhoti. Let me give you an example. Sulzer had a sales office in Mumbai. Its GM went to a mill to negotiate sale of looms. He had with him a Swiss tech asstt to explain new features. contd....
@hvgoenka And don't we all know which private bank needs cleansing?
That about sums up most of the problems India faces. Never understood what is wrong with a dhoti. Indian elite continue to suffer a huge inferiority complex vis-à-vis the developed world. https://t.co/epfuP7zIyV
Priorities need to be discussed, debated and reset. Until govt suspends harping upon regional air connectivity agriculture cannot take off. Jai Shri Ram. https://t.co/fMqV3ZuKXx
Perhaps Shastriji was the only PM who really understood the Indian economy. https://t.co/n9cR6ToaSi

Much of what Gandhi's critics say is logical but equally logical is the fact that Indians wanted ways of contributing to freedom struggle that did not inconvenience or endanger them. Gandhi fulfilled this need. https://t.co/uitDFaCYiP
Shouldn't we wait until the whole thing becomes clearer. Maybe the police officer is guilty but maybe he is not guilty. https://t.co/HSn1JxJ2ua
Nothing accelerates economic growth like stability in consumer prices, commodities, currencies, bourses and … yes, politics. @arunjaitley
Kumar Vishwas has put a video on YouTube. The small and selected audience refused to support his attempts to ridicule @narendramodi . Amazing charisma.

LS2019 will have only two major contenders. What @narendramodi offered in LS2014 and what people think @narendramodi will deliver after LS2019. All others shall be fringe players. https://t.co/HHGdUmvFRx
Please focus on what people need and want and identify what can be delivered in a jiffy. What has been given is substantial by any standards but repeating it too many times is hurting BJP's prospects. https://t.co/HHGdUmvFRx
