The 5th Circuit Court has overstepped its bounds, costing working Americans billions in lost retirement savings.		It's crystal clear that the @GOP &amp; its justices will continue to give special interests every break imaginable, while doing nothing for Main Street Americans.
The Fiduciary Rule protects consumers, plain &amp; simple. It gives hardworking Americans the dignity of a secure retirement.		Requiring financial advisers to act in their client's best interest, not for their own bottom line, shouldn't be a matter of debate. https://t.co/Gh0haQygVX
I'm inconsolable over the loss of my dear friend, Rep. Louise Slaughter. When I came to DC, Louise took me under her wing &amp; showed me how to be a fierce legislator. She was my #shero, mentor &amp; friend. Her trailblazing spirit will live on in my heart &amp; in the halls of Congress.
So much for #DrainTheSwamp: 83% of the benefits from the #GOPTaxScam go to the wealthiest 1% of Americans. 		Even more damning, 86 MILLION middle class families will actually see their taxes go up. 		@SpeakerRyan's policies are nothing short of shameful.
#HappyBirthdayRBG, you're a shining star of justice &amp; integrity, paving the way for many more courageous, brilliant #sheroes like you. Preach 🙏🏾 💫 https://t.co/XOzl0KEgiC
Looking into the fierce, young eyes at today's student rally, I was filled w/ sadness at the reality that @GOP leadership refuse to prioritize their innocent lives. I revisited my #GunControl poem to express this frustration. Now, I want to share it w/ you #NationalStudentWalkout https://t.co/zJHjckUQjT
I stand behind these young Wisconsinites in solidarity of spirit. Know that I hear you &amp; know that I won't stop fighting for you until Congress passes reforms &amp; every student across the country is safe from gun violence 💪🏾#NeverAgain #NationalWalkoutDay https://t.co/SbyCDnvAkE
We depend on courts to protect our civil rights, but US Court of Appeals nominee, Kyle Duncan, has a nasty record when it comes to the rights of my Black brothers &amp; sisters		That's why I'm calling on the Senate to #StopDuncan's confirmation to a lifetime appointment #CourtsMatter https://t.co/LlexvKMXwI
It's time the @GOP listen up, because these students aren't going anywhere. They've sparked a movement that has captured national attention &amp; changed public opinion. Now, they need action. They need #GunControlNOW. 	#EnoughIsEnough  #NeverAgain #NationalSchoolWalkout https://t.co/ZTNXtKNvi8

It's no coincidence @realDonaldTrump's #TaxScam adds $1.5 trillion to the deficit, while the #TrumpBudget cuts $1.8 trillion from Social Security, Medicare &amp; Medicaid. Once again, we see the @GOP forcing American families to sacrifice so the wealthiest can become even wealthier.
S/o to these #Milwaukee teens for letting everyone know that clean water is a human right, not a privilege determined by zip code or resources. 👏🏾keep on, keeping on👏🏾 @TRUESKOOL414 #MilwaukeeWaterCommons https://t.co/ti5WpbNHGe
The fact that &gt;5,300 US communities, including #Milwaukee have water systems in violation of "acceptable" levels of lead &amp; copper is outrageous. It shouldn't be a matter of debate that the lead service lines we know are poisoning our children be replaced. https://t.co/aN6GTcf3cj
A decision like @realDonaldTrump's #steel tariff plan requires careful &amp; strategic consideration, not an off the cuff roll-out more worthy of reality TV than the presidency. Family-supporting jobs at @MillerCoors &amp; @harleydavidson shouldn't be pawns in Trump's twitter trade war.
My mother didn't have much money, but she made sure to fill each of her 9 babies w/ strength &amp; love. Her example taught us to rise up &amp; resist.

#SCOTUS justices should set the standard for integrity, not diminish the Court's reputation by pandering to right-wing billionaires.		#JanusvAFSCME is just one example of the dangers of dark money. This time workers &amp; unions are on the line. I hate to think what could be next.
Even more damning, the very morning #SCOTUS announced they'd hear #JanusvAFSCME, Justice Gorsuch was at the Trump International Hotel giving a speech for The Fund for American Studies (TFAS).		Which billionaires are behind TFAS? The #KochBrothers. 		https://t.co/6K74l6GFAL

The @USCBO &amp; @JCTGov estimate that growth from @realDonaldTrump's #TaxScam will be less than 1%.		Today, I asked Chairman Powell if the #FederalReserve agrees with these estimates.

@Amusedrice @MarkWarner @GOP @elizabethforma @senchuckschumer @JoyAnnReid Respectfully, I think you've read an article that misrepresents the bill I'm supporting. I hope this explainer clears things up for you:		https://t.co/evknJK1jt5 		My staff is standing by if you'd like to talk this through: (202) 225-4572
@boneallergy @HouseGOP I am in no way trying to deregulate payday lenders. Here's an explainer that I think will help: 		https://t.co/evknJK1jt5 		My staff is standing by if you'd like to talk this through: (202) 225-4572
Under #GOPTaxScam Child Tax Credit:		💰💰 A couple making $200,000 a year with 2 kids would get $3,200	❌ A single mom with 2 kids, working full time for min wage would see NO benefit		@HouseGOP, why are you leaving working families behind?
@dendria Again, in no way does this bill water down regulations on payday lenders or the @CFPB payday rule (which I've proudly supported since day 1). It's a complex issue but my staff is always here to address any concerns my constituents have about my legislative efforts: (202) 225-4572
@dendria For those with access to bank loans, we want to ensure absolute certainty around the agreed upon terms, including the interest rate. We don’t want banks to sell that loan to a 3rd party where terms/rates change. That’s why we need uniformity. And that’s what this bill guarantees.
@dendria We don’t want them to turn to payday lenders where they’ll have to agree to interest rates they can't possibly afford. We don't them thrown into a cycle of poverty that's impossible to escape. We want to make sure low-income people have a sensible place to turn for a fair loan.
@dendria That’s where a bank loan becomes a lifesaver. That is, of course, if you have access to such loans.	 	But if we allow unsafe and unsound practices and products to harm the banking industry, our constituents will have fewer places to turn when they desperately need that money.
I'd be happy to, @dendria. Thread: Too many Americans don’t have access to loans. Why is this a problem? For those who earn hourly wages, a broken-down car can potentially be a life-altering event. If you don’t have money to quickly fix it, chances are your job is on the line. https://t.co/l3W78t1eDj
Sadly this article got it wrong, @rotowiremario. This bill only ensures banks, NOT payday lenders, will continue to operate in a safe and sound manner so they can continue to provide loans to low-income people. My staff is standing by to talk this through with you: (202) 225-4572 https://t.co/YDF96OKbD5
I appreciate your concern, @YDSMarquette. Despite what this article says, in no way does the Access to Credit Act water down regulations on payday lenders. My staff is more than happy to go over this with you &amp; address any of your questions. Feel free to call us: (202) 225-4572 https://t.co/ukQ1hxwPv8

On @TheLastWord tonight @ 10:30pm ET to discuss why I'll be attending @realDonaldTrump @Inaug2017 as symbol of opposition not normalization.
You know what @taylorswift13 would say about that: #HatersGonnaHate but it's on us to take the highroad/stay on course. Thanks @sarah_reddin https://t.co/cn8Efer0YF
