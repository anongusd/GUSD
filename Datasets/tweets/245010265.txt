@bessbell Bess, please do some reading on an organization called Christians United for Israel (CUFI - https://t.co/6xaLOQotLt). They are the largest "pro-Israel" PAC in the US, 40 times the size of AIPAC. Evangelical politicians are much more likely to be owned by CUFI.
@JuliaDavisNews I didn't see anything that indicated how long this test would last. It would seem obvious that things like air traffic control systems, and scada applications for infrastructure that runs to other countries, require constant internet connection. Things could get ugly.
@NickRiccardi Yep, look at the group Christians United for Israel. CUFI is huge (much larger than AIPAC, J Street, et. al. combined), and is much more aligned from a religious perspective with republican Congressional members.

@Goblin_Seimen2 @ryanbundygov @BundyRanch As always Gob, thanks for sharing these when you come across them. The broader perspective you provide definitely helps contextualize the crap we see from the poots.
@sparxx @Deemoney521 @amjoyshow @JoyceWhiteVance IANAL,  but Mueller probably has thought about this. Maybe the state can file charges because the crime occured in its jurisdiction?

@Goblin_Seimen2 @ryanbundygov @BundyRanch My guess is that he sticks her with driving the big pig, while he zips around in the middle aged crisis machine.
@Goblin_Seimen2 @ryanbundygov @BundyRanch I presume there's more to the story, I guess the police reports and the sworn statements by the Walmart employees will fill in the gaps.
@TrevHotch Hadn't thought of that. If that's the case, then she's probably Manafort's golden ticket to a pardon. Doubt Trump would allow them both to sit in prison.
@TrevHotch Wait until you see his tears the moment he realizes that he is totally dependent on her for his commissary. What do you think she'll choose: a manicure or Mike and Ikes for Manafort?
@Goblin_Seimen2 Quite honestly what you're talking about is endemic to the poots. KK, Gavin, Lambo, the Bundys, they all share that same trait.
@Goblin_Seimen2 Yeah, something triggered Walmart to call the cops, and it wasn't a (federal) copyright violation. That comment the cops made to her about needing help, probably wasn't made sarcastically. Let's hope that the net result of that whole episode is that she gets some help.
@TrevHotch @Goblin_Seimen2 OMG! A Baio and Barr buddy picture! HA!
@Goblin_Seimen2 That was the worst version of Alice's Restaurant I've ever heard!		Honestly, thanks for sharing that. I knew it was going to be stupid, but that was beyond stupid.
@Goblin_Seimen2 Dollars to donuts she still does her weekly shopping at da' Mart. AND... if she won her suit, she'd probably use the money to decorate her house in the latest Chinese made Walmart chic (while gladly paying the Trump 25% tariff, cuz she's a patriot).

@mojgan_haji @lrozen I found myself thinking the exact same thing during the speech.
@nahaltoosi All I got out of his speech was that he was a terrible advice giver. When asked for advice to students who wanted a career at State (presumably intended for some of the Iranian students in the room), Pompeo's response was basically "travel" and "be an American". Hardly inspiring.

@robinandriver @TAPSTRIMEDIA @MalcolmNance @amjoyshow @McFaul I was wondering the same thing. FWIW, I agree with your comments.
@robinandriver @TAPSTRIMEDIA @MalcolmNance @amjoyshow @McFaul Totally agree. Last night on Maddow, Joy had an expert on about the people being kicked out of the military despite being promised citizenship for service. They didn't even take a commercial break before moving on to the next topic. We need quality reporting, not quantity.
@robinandriver @TAPSTRIMEDIA @MalcolmNance @amjoyshow @McFaul This exposes the problem of the cable networks siloing the experts. Allowing people like Nance to appear on other networks allows for ideas and information to be spread (and debated/refuted/supported). Expertise should not be contractually limited.
@cranky_david @CTRNewsFeed @Leah_Sottile @ryanjhaas Agreed. She's posted some things which have made me uncomfortable, but that post was breathtaking in all of the wrong ways. Thanks to Cheri for bringing it to our attention. For her own sake I hope Melissa takes it down and apologizes.

@TheRickyDavila Nauert is doing her thing over at State today at 2:30 Eastern. Could be very interesting today.
@RichardKoski @normwilner @JuddApatow I'd guess it was Jared. Making signs in the White House basement is the only thing Jared's security clearance qualifies him for.
@r_common_sense @normwilner @JuddApatow I know, it did the same thing to me!!
@normwilner @JuddApatow It looks terrible, but I bet that Trump insisted on that font so that it matched the one he uses on his buildings.
@normwilner @JuddApatow I hadn't noticed that until you mentioned it. The word Israel at the bottom of the stone has the same space. It looks like it's related to the font they used, the R and the A each have bottom serifs (I think that's what they're called), so they appear to be further apart.
@CjCollingwood11 @Karoli Thanks for your service! I agree that the VA shouldn't be privatized.
@CjCollingwood11 @Karoli I hope that means that the patient recovered.
@ddale8 .@ddale8 You had to laugh to yourself when you reported:	"So it eventually will come down to every comma, every semicolon..."		Your team is expecting our government to use proper grammar when it can't even capitalize properly?!? We're doomed.
@goblin_seimen Point taken... but, they'll be checking under his mattress, or wherever his grifted proceeds wind up.
@goblin_seimen Nah, this is about money. His grift is now much more difficult because the hospitals and lawyers are going to be looking at every penny that enters his bank account.
@CjCollingwood11 @Karoli Fascinating. Thank you!
@TomWlost @LawDavF I don't think Trump, Ross, or Mnuchin are subject to embarrassment. Ross and Mnuchin will probably request military transport to deliver the paperwork removing the sanctions for Xi's approval. All three of them probably shorted ZTE.
@Karoli Any idea what that pin represents? He was wearing one that was very similar in the cigar pics a couple of weeks ago. I though it was a ketchup stain.
@BFriedmanDC Just wondering aloud: Since republicans think corporations are people, can Trump pardon ZTE?

@Carma_2012 @KDbyProxy @samstein @annalecta They paid their lobbying firm 12K a month. Then they decided to pay Cohen 100K a month. That's 112K/month. The difference (or relative value) between 100K and 12K (88K) is meaningless. Respectfully, I'm not trying to be snarky. They were buying influence.
@didahous @connie_rodeconn @TheRickWilson Well said, that is some "through the looking glass" stuff.

@hitmeister1 @badwolf303 @TIKdOffPinsNTh1 @renato_mariotti I've been thinking about that too, and agree with you. BUT, HIPAA pretty much makes the entire president's health press conference a sham. The doc can't say or release anything the president won't allow him to say or release. If the doc lied, that's a different matter.
@badwolf303 @TIKdOffPinsNTh1 @hitmeister1 @renato_mariotti The cynic in me would argue that a person doesn't get the White House physician job without being a political player. That doesn't mean that Jackson is a bad doc, it just means that he knows how to play the game.
@badwolf303 @TIKdOffPinsNTh1 @hitmeister1 @renato_mariotti I'm afraid that Dr. Jackson is not done making a fool of himself. Maybe Jackson will see the light after he breaks the VA medical system.
@hitmeister1 @TIKdOffPinsNTh1 @renato_mariotti I agree. Trump would have no second thoughts taking the US into war without the backing of our allies. Trump doesn't understand that the us v. them dynamic loses its luster when "them" is the entire rest of the planet.

@RubberD01 @HighPlainsGirl1 @TIKdOffPinsNTh1 @renato_mariotti @realDonaldTrump Right, and each of those elements exposes Putin and his kleptocrats to even more sanctions from the US and the world, possibly even the loss of access to the SWIFT (money transfer) system. That's a tough pill to swallow for the Russians. In exchange for that, they get Mike Pence?
@RubberD01 @HighPlainsGirl1 @TIKdOffPinsNTh1 @renato_mariotti @realDonaldTrump The goods will have to be more than a "pee tape". I don't think that the base and the Republicans would drop him over yet another sex scandal. Russia would basically have to admit to collusion at this point to move Congress.

@TIKdOffPinsNTh1 @renato_mariotti I was thinking along the same lines. Bashar al Assad should be very nervous, Trump is reckless enough to think about decapitating Syria's leadership. I wouldn't put it past Trump to throw the Middle East and the world into chaos to divert attention from this stuff.

@DarthKrayt9 @TravelerGrad @MollyJongFast @SpeakerRyan There's a shitload of crazy in that part of the bracket. Beating Cruz, Rohrabacher, and Nunes, may be too much to ask for an old Kentucky Turtle.
@TravelerGrad @MollyJongFast @SpeakerRyan I think the 1 seeds are good, with the exception of Nunes. Ryan is Nunes' boss (so to speak). If they make the elite 8, Ryan can terminate Nunes for the rare quarter final bye. With the stakes so high, and Ryan having no sense of fair play, I think Ryan cans Nunes to advance.
@cranky_david My guess is that they'll put him at the kids table. Nothing worse than the kids table at Passover (don't ask it's complicated).
@cranky_david Javanka are Orthodox, which means they are very observant. The good news for Trump is that ketchup is kosher. The bad news for Trump is that he won't be allowed in Javanka's house with food from any fast food joint.
@cranky_david Something tells me that the Passover Seder is going to be very awkward for the Trump/Kushner family later this month.
@benjaminwittes @Yascha_Mounk Awesome conversation. Fascinating stuff!
@EricPeterson602 @mattyglesias If the NCAA tourney teaches us anything, it's beware of the underdog. If the temperance movement plays tough defense (and can make free throws in crunch time), strange things can happen. Looks like a fun and cool exercise!!
@EricPeterson602 @mattyglesias That's a tough draw. Maybe Civil Rights should be the number 1 seed? Women's Suffrage and Temperance movement should be in the same part of the bracket? This was published so we could all criticize it, right? üòÅ
@cranky_david Say it in Russian! That seems to be the secret!
@cranky_david Once you figure it out, you can open a school. No, wait, a university! Cranky University has a great ring to it.
@cranky_david Not sure if this link will work, but here's Engel's portion of the same story:	https://t.co/MSgjBrk3D0
@cranky_david I'd say the odds are 100% that Trump is aware of what's happening. The odds of him doing something stupid regarding this issue are also 100%. By 2020 the entire Spanish/Portuguese speaking world will hate us.
@cranky_david IIRC this was one of the first projects that Ivanka lead for the Trump Org.
@cranky_david Yep, the Trump organization really wants to keep control of that hotel for some reason. That's the same facility that Richard Engle reported on for NBC, which pointed to Russians buying lots of units from the Trumps. This will only get more interesting.
@RVAwonk That area around Tallahassee, FL doing all of those searches on gun control is very intriguing.
@cranky_david @nycsouthpaw @MikeIsaac Fascinating article and thread. VERY educational. Thanks for sharing!
@ZekeJMiller JFC, she's giving out presidential challenge coins to the athletes???
@CjCollingwood11 @wpjenna Yes, this is how Trump's staff manipulates him. Remember, he bombed Syria after being shown pictures of children gassed by Assad. For Parkland his staff only provided him with talking points. I agree, releasing some of the pictures will allow for a more sober discussion of guns.
@RWwatchMA @RightWingWatch I agree. My point was that as a government official he's not supposed to accept gifts as they relate to the execution of his job. As I understand it, if he takes the gun home, he's basically accepted a bribe.
@CTRNewsFeed @chaos_view Mazel Tov!!!
@RWwatchMA @RightWingWatch He's a member of government, can he actually accept the award? Doesn't he have to hand it over to the Library of Congress?
@cranky_david Part and parcel of supply side economics. Someone needs to consume the stuff they build. No better way to increase consumption of bombs, bombers, and bullets than a war.
@cranky_david Horribly handled by the Broward County Sheriff. This should have been handled internally. Tomorrow morning the school resource officer is going to be pilloried by Trump, and is going to be turned into a scapegoat.

@MrKizmo @JonLemire @mharvey816 More likely Trump, Melania, and their lawyers, are having a romantic dinner at Trump International re-re-renegotiating Melania's post-nuptial agreement. Wonder if it's to the point where that building in NYC will be renamed Knavs Tower.

@JoeOutdoor1 @cranky_david @goblin_seimen He's always waxing poetic about the new crap he buys. He did a few on the van IIRC.
@JoeOutdoor1 @cranky_david @goblin_seimen I'm not sure about the new home. I recall he recently bought a new van and spent a shitload of money to modify it.

@GottaLaff Notice that there isn't a single mention of Melania or Baron. I find that incredibly telling.
@goblin_seimen Ha, the state is going to add a couple of charges for bail jumping! Thanks for posting this Gob!
@jmartNYT Not a single mention of Melania or Baron. The priorities of this president are out of whack. President Obama always made time for his family.
@msbellows Thanks for sharing this story. It's both inspirational and sad. First I'd heard of him too.

@TrevHotch @goblin_seimen If the car was "fixed", it's not going to get that kind of gas mileage. IIRC, the fix was to add something to the car which would decrease fuel mileage and performance. If the car wasn't fixed it's spewing CO2 (and isn't allowed in CA).
@cranky_david @tonydphotog @goblin_seimen HA, he did have that encounter with the police that he recorded.
@TrevHotch @goblin_seimen Thanks! I wasn't aware of that recall. I was thinking of the global recall due to VW cheating on the emission tests. IIRC VW wrote code which resulted in fake CO2 results for their diesels if they were hooked up to emission testing machines. It cost them A LOT of money.
@goblin_seimen I'm too lazy to look it up, but please Gawd, let that be one of the models VW recalled last year. If it is, it ain't gonna get 42 mpg.

@SarahAStarkey @anthonyLfisher They claimed it was a church service. They even sang a song, had an organ accompanied "recessional", and served brownies in the "Fellowship Hall".	By claiming it was a church service, they could have hecklers arrested. It's against the law to interrupt a church service in AL.
@etherealspirits I know. He is a republican and was trying to make us sound like the bastion of vote integrity. Never mind the disenfranchisement activities he engages in. He even defended Kobach's voter integrity scam. Eventually the rethugs on the panel stopped asking him questions.
@AnneMorter @anthonyLfisher I watched it. Of course they cheered. They shouted down a heckler and threatened to arrest the next person who interrupted Moore. Believe it or not, this was considered a church service and not a political rally. It's against the law to interrupt a church service in AL.

@koreycabra Trump never accepts blame for anything. He won't for this either (assuming #NetNuetrality is overturned, and ATT can close the TW deal while keeping CNN). If they stay true to form, Trumpers will believe him and blame Hillary.
@goblin_seimen Is it time for us to start airing grievances already? I thought Festivus came after Thanksgiving.
@cato218 Very cool, thanks for sharing that.
@HorseShort @dcpetterson @billprady @sunlightwarden I'm not defending ATT in any way. My point is that what Trump likes about reversing #NetNeutrality will hurt the propagandists he likes. ATT will put CNN in its "fast lane", ComCast will do the same with NBC/MSNBC. Fox and Sinclair will have to pay for speed.
@dcpetterson @billprady @sunlightwarden IMO, you've touched on the exact reason the Trump/Justice Dept. is fighting the ATT/TW merger. They are terrified that ATT would promote CNN on its platforms and slow down access to Fox/Sinclair/Drudge etc. ATT has millions of broadband and cell subscribers.
@taywiles Sorry, but Ammon has NO understanding of political, historical and constitutional theory.
@EdKrassen Now we know why DJT has had it in for the ATT merger. W/out net neutrality ATT can give preference to CNN on all its broadband services, relegating Fox and Sinclair to "slow lane". He's using Justice to defend his preferred propagandists.

@HGTomato I guess if NoScript isn't fixed in the next few days, I'll torment myself with uMatrix. This isn't a recommendation, I haven't used it (only read about it). I need a haircut anyway, so pulling my hair out learning a new tool may come in handy.
@HGTomato I hope Mozilla is helping the NoScript team resolve the issue. Feels very vulnerable to have NoScript disabled. I haven't seen an equivalent replacement that I'm willing to take a chance with.

@voltron6666666 @cranky_david @egavactip From his interview, my guess is the "shall not be infringed" part of the 2A is going to be his downfall.
@cranky_david @egavactip That's exactly how it sounded from Moe's description. Sentence 27 months, then time for good behavior factored in.
@voltron6666666 @cranky_david @egavactip It sounded like the sentencing was an agreed upon issue between the judge, plaintiff, and defense. It was agreed upon by court time.
@cranky_david @egavactip There may have been reductions because he "took responsibility" as well. Moe described it poorly, and it made me sleepy.
@voltron6666666 @cranky_david @egavactip That was my hope too. Especially after listening to his jail interview. He sounds like he's ready to get out and go back to "work".
@cranky_david @egavactip The original release date would be March, 2018. But with time reductions for good behavior, it moves to around Christmas of this year.
@cranky_david @egavactip According to the article Mark linked to he was arrested in Dec. 2015. She said something about 50 days/year for good behavior.
@cranky_david @egavactip It sounds like that time frame came from Barbeau's attorney. She has all of the sentencing factors on her livestream.
@egavactip According to Moe, based on time served and good behavior, he should be out by Christmas.

@cranky_david @notpotus34 I hope, in retrospect, that you can forget about buzz-kill barbie and focus on the cool stuff. 75% was pretty cool, totality had to be great
@notpotus34 @cranky_david You've got 7 years to get ready for the next one. Hopefully you'll be up for the adventure.
@cranky_david @notpotus34 From what we could see on TV, folks in totality seemed euphoric/awed by the experience. Hope you got to feel some of that.
@notpotus34 @cranky_david Hope everything is OK and that you still had a chance to enjoy the eclipse.
@cranky_david Yes, we got 75%. The temp felt like it dropped about 3 or 4 degrees. That was likely due to the beer, but we'll say it was the eclipse, ok?

@woodruffbets So we paid for her to see the eclipse? I'm sure she's angry that we only paid to send her to a place with 96% totality.

@amzieaa @NewMexlefty @goblin_seimen @gavinseim It's hard to track the "evolution" of Gav. He seems to be dedicated to pissing cops off by calling them corrupt to their faces. Then he runs
@NewMexlefty @goblin_seimen @gavinseim Gavin also helps the cops in the video he released by admitting to obstructing the officer in his narrative. Later he calls it intervening üëç
@NewMexlefty @goblin_seimen @gavinseim His bond was $2000 cash. That doesn't sound, to me, like they are playing around. He puts officers at risk. I think they'll build a case.
@goblin_seimen @gavinseim I bet he's in real trouble this time. They'll get a warrant for the phone. Take the videos and his contacts. Then the fun starts.
@markknoller Trump is making him walk home?
@NewMexlefty @goblin_seimen I'll bet he didn't shut up the entire time. Hope they at least got a promise from him to leave that cop alone.
@goblin_seimen According to Gav's FB page - he's been released. üò° Now we get to look forward to him defending himself in court. üòÇ
@cranky_david @NewMexlefty @goblin_seimen Do you think Gav would obstruct without it being on video? Wonder if the vid is usable with the camera shaking and all...
@NewMexlefty @cranky_david @goblin_seimen Pretty damn sure that Trump is thinking, "FU Gav, hold my beer". It seems to be a constant with Trump.
@EviIisaArtForm @goblin_seimen Sounds like the arresting officer is the guy Gav filmed a couple of weeks ago. My guess is that the cop has seen it, and is saying something

@NetworkJunkyz @kylegriffin1 Seeing Newt's recent comments on Mueller are eye opening. Newt seems frightened about what a real investigation will find. Maybe about him?
@phac3ti0us @KeithOlbermann Yep, but by his own admission he struck out. The Pee tape infers that there was more than pee involved. I can't believe I just wrote that.
@KeithOlbermann Dollars to donuts there's a clause in his prenup which grants his soon to be ex-wife a shit ton of money if he's proven unfaithful.

@cranky_david @CraigSh49850532 @CTRNewsFeed @JamesBuchal @egavactip @BillPostOregon Wasn't there some issue related to Rhodes and a weapon during the Bundy Ranch episode?
@CTRNewsFeed @JamesBuchal Jimmie actually responded to me in a thread @egavactip posted on this same topic. A guy named Bill Post liked Jimmie's posts.
@researcherwolf1 Gavin probably deleted it.
@cranky_david @JamesBuchal @egavactip Isn't everyone's security enhanced when it's done by the lowest bidder? Maybe Jimmie will try it. Seriously, what could go wrong?
@JamesBuchal @egavactip Both groups have the same authority under the law. That would make the analogy apt.
@egavactip @JamesBuchal Maybe Jimmie should ask the Rolling Stones how ideas like this work out. What could go wrong?
@Ardhen723 That's true to a degree. On the other hand there's a larger market because that $1.20 burger represents less of a person's total income.

@wdmichael3 That's just a stupid tweet. Holy shit
@wdmichael3 How do you know that it's not being done?
@wdmichael3 He's right. As a military office of the US, I'd expect you to agree that an attack on the US by a foreign power is an act of war
@wdmichael3 You first. If Russia hacked the DNC and RNC, what will you say?
@wdmichael3 LOL, take Donald's word for it then, fine. But here's a question for you: What if the CIA is right? You OK with RU hacks?
@wdmichael3 Yep, I'm sure you did.
@DJW_Retired @wdmichael3 Ahh, fake news for the win! Back to Breitbart for you.
@nazani14 Ha!
@wdmichael3 @DJW_Retired Thought you were the deep IT specialist.
@wdmichael3 Yep, buying into Donald's IT prowess is much easier.
@wdmichael3 @DJW_Retired Or a sophisticated hack capable of getting behind the malware detection servers. See Russian hack of Germany
@DJW_Retired @wdmichael3 CIA and other intelligence sources say otherwise.
@wdmichael3 So you knew that malware was left on both networks, right?
@wdmichael3 You know there was malware left on the DNC and RNC servers, right? That's how hacks work.
@wdmichael3 k, we're back to where we started. Have a nice evening.
@JohnEhmet See ya!
@wdmichael3 They assessed "no evidence" to create a consensus view. Got it. https://t.co/bDxUiZDAVv https://t.co/tzXg0bkaSf
@JohnEhmet @wdmichael3 @FBI @ladykayaker @JoyAnnReid Link?
@wdmichael3 Wait. So part of their justification is that the Russians are too good to be caught unless they want to be? Really?
@wdmichael3 "Strong suspicion but Russians are too good..." your words. How many FBI and CIA analysts are "politicians"?
@wdmichael3 Does an engineer use "strong suspicion" based on "no evidence"?
@wdmichael3 So how many is that? 2.8 million is the current PV difference.
@wdmichael3 How many illegals voted?
@wdmichael3 This has to do with whether the federal government will honor its treaty with the Native Americans in North Dakota.
@wdmichael3 @FBI @ladykayaker @JoyAnnReid From "no evidence" to "strong suspicion" in a few tweets. OK
@wdmichael3 @FBI @ladykayaker @JoyAnnReid Yep, cuz that's exactly what the CIA, NSA and 14 other intelligence agencies do - guess. ROTFLMAO.
@wdmichael3 @FBI @ladykayaker @JoyAnnReid Yes, they do:	https://t.co/37iLG6Yd1G https://t.co/FRSy6NlSyh
@wdmichael3 @FBI @ladykayaker @JoyAnnReid Which analysts are those? The CIA analysts disagree with your statement.
@wdmichael3 @FBI @ladykayaker @JoyAnnReid So your in the "CIA's assessment of Russian interference was politically motivated" camp?
@Karoli Maybe add testimony and tax returns from Trump to the list? Trump and Bannon emails may clarify some issues as well.
@KeithOlbermann Sorry Keith, Joe Walsh is still a con man. He's pulling a Trump on anyone who believes him. Expect others to do the same.
@ChelaW4315 @nytimes @TeenVogue Dayum! Well done. Following @laurenduca now. Thanks for sharing this.
@ezlusztig Remember Obama the night b4 Bin Laden killed? At the Correspondent's Dinner, cool as a cucumber. Doubt he'd give Trump a pass.
@richm31 @SopanDeb @JoyAnnReid LOL, wonder if he sends Barron out there to read the "blind trust" statement and run away!
@richm31 @SopanDeb @JoyAnnReid Friday night news dump. Give it the weekend to percolate. Trump's presser next week will be "interesting".
@DavidCornDC I wish you'd ask this question of Tribe and Lessig. Is the oath "implied" if you run for office? Didn't Trump sign something?
@j_salvo @digby56 He also knew that the Dems knew everything. He projected his response on them and thought they'd leak info to press.
@ladykayaker @JoyAnnReid Russia has 1 aircraft carrier. Russians lose planes trying to land on it. RU troops will fly United. Bag charges!
@stevel3000 @davidfrum His job is @POTUS. The information was top secret, he can't just leak it. He was and is in a crappy position.
@ladykayaker @JoyAnnReid They live in a fantasy. Agenda 21, chemtrails, UN invading TX. They've prepped 2 cans of SPAM &amp; a bottle of Pepto.
@Tedards @AnillaManrique @johnnysgrrl @FranklinFoer @POTUS Obama is in a shitty position. As a Constitutional expert he knows it.
@Ssimms777 @MalcolmNance @Lawrence Unfortunately, my guess is that McConnell and Paul Ryan decide who's on the committees on the (R) side.
@Ssimms777 @MalcolmNance @Lawrence That will be a report, which will lead to hearings. Question is if govt is too partisan to trust?
@Tedards @johnnysgrrl @FranklinFoer Remember the pics of Trump w/ @POTUS after election? No eye contact. Pretty sure something was said.
@Tedards @johnnysgrrl @FranklinFoer @POTUS After election POTUS role is clear, smooth transition. Doesn't mean he isn't orchestrating this.
@johnnysgrrl @Tedards @FranklinFoer Don't forget Lynch sent a memo 60 days b4 election reminding govt not to interfere. That includes @POTUS
@MalcolmNance To your point on @Lawrence, can the fed gov investigate election interference or must an independent organization look into it
Holy shit! Comey was party to a CIA briefing to Congress about Russian hacking 4 Trump. https://t.co/ZZZxQKrs7G
@wtfmain78 Yep, I agree. With Trump naming Rmoney's niece as head of RNC that debt is paid off. Trump to Mitt: Sorry, not sorry, sucker.
@CraigSh49850532 Listened to the debate. Sounds like CR will pass. Dems pissed that coal benes not extened, but won't shut down gov't.
#christmasin3words Chinese food, movie!
@cranky_david Great read, thanks for sharing another nightmare. üò±
@GoFishLynn @sarahkendzior Also, CNN article is about the House of Representatives - McCain and Graham are Senators.
@nktpnd Trump should know about this! China should name their new bomber "Trump" and insult him on twitter so he'll have a clue!
@Oregonian WOW! Spectacular. Wonder how much of it will look like that in 4 years.

@Karoli Been there. Dog smugly trotted off wagging his tail like he'd discovered penicillin or something.
@Karoli It could always be worse. You could have just brought him/her in, and he/she looked you square in the eye while peeing on the floor.

Keep an eye on Trump's nominee for head of the Interior Department. That's the person over the Bureau of Indian Affairs. https://t.co/59pDxbQgZ4
@JoyAnnReid No crosstabs? Is this a poll of Politico "experts" or the general population? I think it's the former, which is misleading. üò°
@cranky_david They know we won't believe the shit. All that matters is that they believe it themselves.
@cranky_david Conway shorter: We can weaponize Pizzagate for Donald's every whim and fantasy.
@cranky_david @TrevHotch Looks like Laurence Tribe and Lisa Bloom will assist Pro Bono too.
@cranky_david I'd prefer he went with Hillary, but it's better than Trump. What do you think that guy's in box looks like? Bet it's ugly!!!
@StevilleJanae I live in a red state. I think things here are going to get ugly. But please remember, there are blue cities in red states
@ezlusztig @jansheetspigg That would make the Electoral College even more powerful. More progressives in fewer states = less power/voter

@penultimatepen @evenbev @IMPL0RABLE @Reuters Difference is Putin craves "Greater Russia". Trump craves being at the top of the Forbes list.
@evenbev @IMPL0RABLE @Reuters Honestly I can't imagine how they feel. Let's hope the recount succeeds or the Electoral College has some guts
@Juan_Abbe @evenbev @IMPL0RABLE The show sounds interesting. Thanks for sharing the article, interesting perspective on the NOR/RUS issue.
@evenbev @IMPL0RABLE @Reuters I just can't imagine what our allies are thinking right now. They didn't deserve this.
I'm sure that Donald is having a wonderful time at his costume party. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is waiting for him to grow up. https://t.co/WXA4cTArk8
@NastierWoman @IMPL0RABLE @Reuters Thinking the same thing. 	Donnie's going to take the appeasement route. It worked so well the last time.
@chrislhayes  Are there other sources than the FT article? I really hope this isn't true, if it is we're in deep trouble.
@cranky_david My guess is both. He seems to enjoy making us as miserable as possible.

@Zelda23Pinwheel @Nord_Eh Ha, you're right, how could I forget?
@Zelda23Pinwheel @Nord_Eh Maybe, but the color of the people taking over the property will play a part too. I'd guess white males get a pass

@cadria04 @The_Jesus_Mural @hannahudomlee Right! And watch for tariffs when Cubans try to move their companies. Trump has no heart.
@MargaretKipp @BraddJaffy Guantanamo is suddenly looking more valuable by the day. What's a kleptocrat to do? Trump National at Guantanamo?

@Ed_d_ie I'm willing to bet that next Thanksgiving we will see pictures of the Obama family doing this again. PBO &amp; family are a class act.
@CheriSpeak Happy Thanksgiving, hope you're feeling better!
@cranky_david @AnneMorter @Nord_Eh Cheney at least ran a global company. Pence got booed throwing first pitch @ a minor league BB game.
@cranky_david @AnneMorter @Nord_Eh Pence is going to make Cheney look good in comparison. Pence will try to "fix" Cheney's gay daughter.

@Karoli Any way to determine how many national security briefings Trump received before this meeting? From news reports it looks like two.
@now_justice @egavactip @jjmacnab @WEWS The family was home at the time, the stuff was prolly stolen by someone who knew it was there.

@JoelNihlean @Spritely2315 Great set of tweets, hope you don't mind a new follower.

@egavactip @psiphyr Please be right. The acceptance of Sessions, Bannon, and Flynn has me reevaluating where I thought we were as a country.
Great read, well worth the time. https://t.co/4SfZfGdzB4
@IdahoSpork @cranky_david Swung is an understatement. More like leaving earth's gravitational pull.
@etherealspirits @pirateannie16 Personally, I don't think so. The roots of that idea began before the general election. We split ourselves
@jhiattsteele @kurteichenwald But having the NY Bar sanction him will help prevent further similar acts and hit him in the wallet.
@Leah_Sottile He'll withdraw this. If OR had a law like this on the books the Bundys would have been easily convicted.
@pirateannie16 I think your assessment is correct. This was my biggest fear if Bernie had won the nomination.
@kurteichenwald Isn't she a lawyer too? Can't she file a complaint to the Bar? Even Fox's lawyer heard it. She needs to do her part to help.
@Nord_Eh It's marketing. Trying to make people believe that Skousenism is to the left of DJT, broadening his audience. Beck is Beck.
@Nord_Eh Watched the interview. Glen is using DJT to promote the Skousen interpretation of the Constitution. Same as it ever was.
@psiphyr @realDonaldTrump @SecretService Thankfully Don is as subtle as Ya'll Quaida: HE. MUST. FILM. HIS. ACTIONS.
@Chakeenah It will take more than one cycle. Gerrymandering makes it almost impossible to flip Congress. It will take multiple elections.
@RozierCarol Fry considers himself a "Messianic Jew". Much like "Jews for Jesus" groups, they have no relation to mainstream Judaism.
@JuddLegum Without the well defined blind trust, does an attack on a Trump property abroad constitute an attack on Trump? They are "his".
@gunslinger59 Fuck muting her, I blocked her. She kind of looked like Olive Oyl though...

@Nord_Eh @madler9000 Thought you'd like that!
@madler9000 @Nord_Eh
@wtfmain78 POTUS was brilliant today. He pushed some of DJT's buttons and put him on notice. It's a shame we've come to this.
@wtfmain78 POTUS is painting DJT into a corner. Same with the comments on climate agreement, PPACA, and Iran. Daring DJT to break agreements
@evenbev I still think that Obama's first words to Trump were "Hi Donnie! Did you know that the NSA and the CIA work for me until January?"
@kurteichenwald Agree with most of what you write, but "normalizing" low information voters is too dangerous. They have salted the earth
@Nord_Eh How about Josh?
@cranky_david @Nord_Eh @sarahkendzior Not necessarily "pleasant" reading. But what I've read so far has been very enlightening.
@cranky_david,@Nord_Eh You may enjoy reading a few articles by @sarahkendzior, interesting stuff. Had a bead Trump way in advance.
@dystopiarus Great point!
@cranky_david @mamaria33 @dystopiarus LOL!

@CheriSpeak How can they take the land they need for Deseret if someone else absconds with the land to create a new country!?!?
@Scout_Finch Maybe to keep people from leaving?
@TrevHotch Won't be long before Christie says he needs "more time with his family".
@PaganInGeorgia If Donald has his way...
@PaganInGeorgia The look I saw was, "One day you will be cheering for me. It WILL be my turn."
@PaganInGeorgia What sticks out to me is the look on Baron's face on election night. He looks like Damien from the Omen.

@GLBRBR @mrJackCalvert @jbierm02 @nwjerseyliz My guess is that they kill the filibuster for this Congress. They need to "move" quickly.
@CraigSh49850532 @egavactip @jdforward Yeah you right! Back to the ballot box, STAT! I wish. Thanks for the chuckle.

@cranky_david @amzieaa @psiphyr HA! I always thought 538 was the gold standard. Seeing the model over the last week has been "interesting".
@cranky_david @amzieaa @psiphyr Link to NYT Senate Projection:	https://t.co/E8sa1nQ9Ju
@cranky_david @amzieaa @psiphyr Dkos projects a 66% chance of a 50-50 Senate. NYT shows a 56% chance of a D Senate.	https://t.co/Ck2Pi7crfy
@cranky_david @amzieaa @psiphyr I just saw that. But the odds of her getting a D senate have tanked since Comey's announcement. No honeymoon
@amzieaa @psiphyr Hope you're right. Two weeks ago I would have agreed without reservation. Thanks to Comey, I am nervous.

@chrisgeidner Anything from KellyAnne Conway?
@egavactip When you're ready to crawl up the wall let us know.
@Ardhen723 @egavactip IMO, Trump winning. He can do irreparable harm to the country in 4 years.
@egavactip Will you tell us how you voted? Curious about how an expert sees it. I'm pretty worried.
@NewMexlefty @slopringly @scottevansmusic You're absolutely right. And they'll blame the government for the situation instead of themselves.
@slopringly @scottevansmusic Yep, I've read her blog posts. She's in for a rude awakening, and it may mean 2-3 jobs. Ryan truly is an idiot.
@scottevansmusic RB's wife will need to get her resume polished up. She's going to be the bread winner for that family for a long time.
@2ndfor1st Briels should take on Ward if he wants to make a statement. I'm sure much more money would be made. What's he afraid of?

@NewMexlefty @TRKessler55 @flyaway47 Had a flashback of the sound the mimeo machine used to make. Ka-CHUNK, Ka-CHUNK, ... Smelled great too
@kmdenmark According to his timeline his campaign "retweeted" it. Regardless, that word perfectly describes Sid Miller.
@NewMexlefty @evenbev @skaterdood76 There you go getting all "bound by the constraints of reality" again! They might pay, aliens may be real
@evenbev @skaterdood76 IIRC those that took the plea deals have to pay. Those convicted in Feb. will have to pay too. Bundys won't care.

@RoseMerrideth My guess is that freedom of movement is gone. Freedom of communications gone. Bring a weapon and it's at your own risk.
@hakujin Try Ryan's quote on the "current culture" being more important than Native American claims to the land around Burns.
@DemocracyYes Part of their MO. Wait until you see how they defend themselves in NV. Will claim they are Civil Rights defenders like MLK Jr.
#OregonWasRobbed Nite all, rough day :-(
#oregonwasrobbed I hope there is truth to this statement. It could explain everything. https://t.co/HNNrSK4icM
@cadria04 Just saw on OLive that Shawna added her two cents. "This is a mob, it's mob rule and we need to stop it". I so wanted her in jail.
#Oregonwasrobbed Jill Stein weighs in. https://t.co/oL6fNvFPEw
@mccogan @Shady_Mitt @Oregonian already has a story up about this:	https://t.co/WW9ILB0VNR
@Shady_Mitt @maddow @andersoncooper @megynkelly They were covering Pence's plane sliding off the runway in NYC. No one hurt.
@Juan_Abbe @voltron6666666 @CraigSh49850532 @MandyM2S @cranky_david @really_imean IIRC The Brooks Brothers Rebellion.
#OregonWasRobbed Disappointed that none of the cable news outlets covered this at all. @maddow, @andersoncooper, and @megynkelly Big miss.
@voltron6666666 @CraigSh49850532 @MandyM2S @cranky_david @really_imean Excellent analogy.
@MandyM2S @cranky_david @CraigSh49850532 @voltron6666666 @really_imean Of course it wouldn't be his fault if a LEO got killed.
@Nord_Eh @really_imean They were freaked out by a fucking Cessna.
@RozierCarol @AnneMorter @cadria04 I also wonder if the poot racket going on outside was intimidating to the jurors.
@TammeyGirl Take care, thanks for the follow.
@Nord_Eh @really_imean One round from the Ma Deuce brings in the National Guard.
@cranky_david @CraigSh49850532 @voltron6666666 @really_imean COWS folks will see this as a godsend for their cause.
@cranky_david @CraigSh49850532 @voltron6666666 @really_imean Gotta vote straight ticket dem. R's will not fund Fed LE as they cut taxes.
@NewMexlefty @cranky_david @really_imean Great point. And the @jjmacnab's and @egavactip's who have a whole new paradigm to digest - quickly
@cranky_david @really_imean Absolutely. Doubt there will be any more waiting it out. But who knows what would have happened in Burns?
@Nord_Eh @really_imean Might, is the only way the poots seem to learn. Dude in the watchtower fires on the MRAP, game over.
@cranky_david @really_imean Think you want to be the guy in the watchtower with a gun the next time the poots grab at MNWR?
@cadria04 That's what I was thinking. They deliberate for days with no result. Change the juror and 5 hours later... Presto.
#OregonWasRobbed https://t.co/0rrjk2sno7
@ElaineSoCal Take care!
@really_imean This is was REALLY scares me. This changes the calculus for LEO's and Fed employees in these situations. #Oregonwasrobbed
@Zelda23Pinwheel @amzieaa @ElaineSoCal @PandaEmergency Nothing on #OregonWasRobbed since 2013?
@Zelda23Pinwheel @ElaineSoCal @PandaEmergency I know. Don't know what to say but "On to Nevada" and keep the faith.
@Zelda23Pinwheel @ElaineSoCal @PandaEmergency Thank you.
@egavactip Please take care. These guys will feel more entitled.
@egavactip You are going to be very busy for the next few years. We are going to need you and your teams more than ever now.
@cranky_david @trailblazers A shot for every dribble.
@progresvforever Bet these guys have no memory of these events. It's probably something they do all the time because they're "entitled".
@springchikun U2!
@springchikun Glad it worked out for you. I've been involved in a sitch that gained national exposure. Hard to deal with, even as an adult.
@springchikun @thedougycenter Very glad you accepted help, that can be difficult for some.
@springchikun That's terrible, very sorry.
@MaddowBlog Re: Republican voter intimidation, check out the "Other Help" section. https://t.co/68DMnLt1b7
@brandonlancast2 I've made it about 1/2 way through. Fascinating information. Interesting arc through OAS, Bunkerville, and MNWR.
@cadria04 Poor Sandy, maybe this will help her:	https://t.co/wKNBeHgPRY
@goblin_seimen No mention of Gawd, or eagles, or gunz!? Ammon wouldn't accept it!
@maxoregonian I hope you get paid by the word! Great article, thanks as always for the great reporting.
@Nord_Eh Wondering that too. Seems like a natural, human response even if the court said not to.
@BlueGoose2016 Ha, this is 'Murica, he'll be "singing" from his car on the drive home. No way he stays quiet unless the court orders him to.
@BlueGoose2016 What if his statement was something like: As an ex-BLM firefighter I am biased against folks releasing convicted arsonists?
@CheriSpeak Wouldn't want to be juror #4. He loses "the group" by forcing a restart of the process. There's no such thing as a free lunch.
@goblin_seimen Very clever.
@cranky_david @voltron6666666 @Zelda23Pinwheel @lilsliceofcraze I'd give them pet names. SRB's would be Biased, KK would be Moot, JL = Next
@cranky_david @voltron6666666 @Zelda23Pinwheel @lilsliceofcraze Maybe the lawyers suck. Behind the scenes they are saying "bias" and "mute".
@Yikbug @megynkelly Prompted by Newt Gingrich's misogynistic rant, which the alt-right thinks he used to "school" her. Rethugs built that
@Nord_Eh @goblin_seimen Nah, methinks I won't be consuming any raw milk. But thank you!
@Patience_Miles @Zelda23Pinwheel @slopringly @goblin_seimen Come 2 Jazz Fest in NOLA. The Gospel Tent is awesome. Always packed &amp; alive.
@goblin_seimen @Patience_Miles @Zelda23Pinwheel @YouTube LOL!
@Nord_Eh @goblin_seimen Thanks! I feel complete now!
@WinkerMike @lilsliceofcraze Does G-d use football, basketball, or soccer overtime rules. Is it sudden death overtime? That would suck!
@Nord_Eh @goblin_seimen Where's the advice? Dammit, the heading says Symptoms AND Advice! This is half a tweet, it's a twe or an eet!!
@lilsliceofcraze Hmm, "G-d is working overtime". Many philosophical issues raised by that statement. Or, SRB could just be an idiot.
@Zelda23Pinwheel @dsstella @BullishBeauty @SneakerMeaker ROTFLMAO
@goblin_seimen Dayum, KK sounds like she's about ready to blow a gasket. Too many nitrates? Maybe she ate a Bundy apple?
@ToniTagliarino If he writes a book wouldn't the proceeds go towards paying restitution? Isn't that the way it works with felons?
@Nord_Eh @CallmeChass @lilsliceofcraze @Paulmd199 	Mieux vaut avoir essay√© et √©chou√© ...
@Nord_Eh @CallmeChass @lilsliceofcraze @Paulmd199 	Et une augmentation?
@Nord_Eh @CallmeChass @lilsliceofcraze @Paulmd199 	Je suis d√©sol√© pour l'insulte insensible. Puis-je avoir un croissant?
@CallmeChass @Nord_Eh @lilsliceofcraze @Paulmd199 Thanks. I like the way Paul lays out the charges. Mine takes a different approach.
@Nord_Eh @CallmeChass @lilsliceofcraze @Paulmd199 Ha! Did you know that "oops" in French is "oops"? The things you learn from Google!
@Nord_Eh @CallmeChass @lilsliceofcraze @Paulmd199 ooops
@CallmeChass @Nord_Eh @lilsliceofcraze @Paulmd199 This is an older version of my chart: https://t.co/VIq2Ut19Ae
@CallmeChass @Nord_Eh @lilsliceofcraze Yep, one for each. I'll tag you.
@Nord_Eh @CallmeChass @lilsliceofcraze @Paulmd199 Ha! Jason doing his best Rick Perry!	https://t.co/HwmjhS0nsX
@CallmeChass @Nord_Eh @lilsliceofcraze That is fantastic, and it's done by @Paulmd199. All credit where it's due!
@etherealspirits @tonydphotog @DymburtNews Right. I've said elsewhere that this is Mumpoots fault. They knew the Hammonds would b an issue.
@Nord_Eh @lilsliceofcraze @CallmeChass Ahh, I need to update it. Hopefully with a bunch of guilty verdicts.
@Nord_Eh @lilsliceofcraze @CallmeChass What did I do finely?
@tonydphotog @DymburtNews Prolly wasn't biased until some evidence was presented. Like telling an ex-firefighter you want arsonists freed.
@Zelda23Pinwheel @OPB &lt;blush&gt; Awww shucks ma'am.&lt;/blush&gt;
@morphonios Ammon picked TWO morons to defend him. Ya' think claiming you're trying to free two ARSONISTS might piss off a firefighter? Derp
@Zelda23Pinwheel Here ya' go! Hope he can read :-)	https://t.co/R2EIy9XpX8
@Nord_Eh @jazzy_cabella Ex-BLM dude prolly didn't know about charges to Hammonds. Mumpoot did, and knew it would be part of Ammon's case.
@Nord_Eh @TwoRiversTX @jazzy_cabella I'd guess an ex-BLM fire fighter would be biased against folks trying to free ARSONISTS. Might b pissed
@aweiss @LoriLeeSH Bet that bias came up when the BLM juror heard that Bundys wanted the Hammonds freed - after they plead guilty to arson
@Bill_Ludlow @conradjwilson @ameliaOPB I'd read that to be at least three found guilty. Looks like it was worded so as not to tip their hand
@hecktow @dystopiarus Cool, thanks Scott.
@aweiss Everyone knew there was an ex-BLM employee on the jury. It was discussed in vior dire.	https://t.co/R2EIy9XpX8
@dystopiarus @hecktow Only those 2 questions, or were there more? How did the jury look?
@Nord_Eh @blu109 HA!
@Nord_Eh @blu109 It wouldn't, and you'd smell like goat.
@Nord_Eh @blu109 Sour grapes. Shorter KK: "They hit on Dory! Why won't anyone hit on me?!"
@CTRNewsFeed It's from the very long, very excellent, Mother Jones article found here (search Switzerland for cite):	https://t.co/Dfj7nRQcRl
@goblin_seimen Cain't wait!
PS, @CTRNewsFeed, think it's the same guy? https://t.co/u3lmjJvrMg
@scottevansmusic @progresvforever What are the odds it's someone else? How many Swiss Army Poots could there be? https://t.co/kt6E6PPJxN
@Zelda23Pinwheel @Nord_Eh @SneakerMeaker They prolly want him out of OR. Kept him apart from other poots. Now you're not paying for him.
@scottevansmusic @progresvforever Very interesting article. Found this section fascinating, is "Destroyer" our CHS from MNWR (Fabio)? https://t.co/pLSgliqgSW
@SneakerMeaker @CTRNewsFeed Plead guilty on theft charge. Arrested on DUI charges, doesn't say what the outcome was.
@amandapeacher Thank you for the replies and the awesome reporting.
@SneakerMeaker @CTRNewsFeed Yep, DUI's with one "extreme DUI" and a theft charge in 2014:	https://t.co/4WD6QOJ13T
@CTRNewsFeed @SneakerMeaker IIRC he has some alcohol related charges.
@SwidSeor @SphynxCatsRule Willing to bet that AB and RB ignore Fry. They probably see Fry as weak, and think he added to their problems.
@CraigSh49850532 @cranky_david @jazzy_cabella Looking at this page it's easy to see why he wasn't intimidated by Ammon. Ward's the real deal
@amandapeacher Amanda, did Gary Hunt say anything on the call, or did he just listen? Also, how much did the call cost? #oregonstandoff
@goblin_seimen @TVTEDDY @capeannsky HA! Thanks, I hadn't made the connection.
@TammeyGirl @davidkrugfilm Can't let that happen or they win. The US Flag is a prop to them, same as the Constitution. They don't get it.
@goblin_seimen @TVTEDDY @capeannsky I think it is. Google sez Portland, Maine Art Museum is on Congress street. Both Portlands are wierd?
@goblin_seimen @TVTEDDY @capeannsky This is Portland, ME - right?
@Karimala1 @egavactip Great read, scary info. Thanks for sharing it. Wonder if this guy is militia too:	https://t.co/OJp2187BsS
@goblin_seimen @traecrowder As a resident on NOLA, I heartily second this message. Can't wait for their post election show here.
@Nord_Eh @TrevHotch Judge Jones would be interested in that 2. Poots love using federal services (judge's salaries) w/o paying 4 them.
@gunslinger59 @researcherwolf1 No G-String jokes??
@Rocketjc @PaganInGeorgia @researcherwolf1 Very true. Excellent point.
@PaganInGeorgia @researcherwolf1 Read an article on threats the deplorables made to RW journalists - very scary. Afraid poots will act in OR
@researcherwolf1 There will be threats. I worry about JAB, the prosecutors, jury, Grasty, and Ward (not necessarily in that order).
@conradjwilson @NPR @npratc Gratuitous plug for hometown station @WWNO, best station in NOLA.
Link to @conradjwilson's spot on @NPR's @npratc "All things Considered", for those who missed it: 	https://t.co/jj2Awfmu9y	#Oregonstandoff
@conradjwilson Nice job on @NPR's @npratc "All Things Considered" today! Good to hear the case getting national attention during drive time.
@paidprovocateur This ranks up there with KK telling everyone to dress nice, like MLK Jr.
@amzieaa @CTRNewsFeed I think the judge gave the gov until the end of the month to respond.
@CTRNewsFeed My fave:	https://t.co/K86dGuHdpJ
@drk_brd Didn't he walk in front of the FBI holding a firearm before he surrendered?
@CTRNewsFeed Reporters. Supporters will either be trashing the courthouse or experiencing the rapture - depending on which way it goes.
@Nord_Eh Doubt that Mein Fifth Wheel mit einem Cappucino-Hersteller will generate many fans.
@CTRNewsFeed For me, it's how little they respect American ideals and the rule of law. They want a theocracy.
@goblin_seimen 	First 3 minutes - hmm	Next 20 minutes - flat out nuts	Last few minutes - Holy shit WTF did I just listen to?	Just like Trump
@amandapeacher It ain't over until the fat lady sings. Shofar blowers don't count.
@Chewie525 Sorry, Chewie.
@Juan_Abbe @pirateannie16 That should be the motto of the Oregon Standoff. Brilliant.
@skaterdood76 @amandapeacher I'm pretty sure that @KieranSuckling and @publiccarbon can tell us how "welcomed" they were by the poots.
@Juan_Abbe @pirateannie16 That was worth Googling!
@SphynxCatsRule I noticed the bald tires in the pic and figured it was a grift. Happened at night, but not mentioned till late in the AM.
@cranky_david @mccogan Of course. IIRC the speech also highlighted the groundbreaking work done b/t Harney County residents and MNWR.
@mccogan I listened to the speech recently. There was nuance 2 it. He explicitly told them to leave the refuge. Decent speech, bad messenger
@scottevansmusic @CTRNewsFeed Brilliant song / amazing lyrics.
@scottevansmusic @CTRNewsFeed Sang it 2 the "trouble making women" of the Oregon Standoff. He wanted them 2 shut up. WAY WORSE than Blaine
@scottevansmusic @CTRNewsFeed Here's a Jazz/Gospel version of Hallelujah by John Boutte (he wrote/sang Treme theme):	https://t.co/Z2b96gaTNg
@scottevansmusic @CTRNewsFeed Nu guy, named Brand Thornton ;-) . It was worse than terrible. Karaoke style - you didn't miss anything.
@scottevansmusic @CTRNewsFeed What about the version that Brand dedicated to SRB?
@itsmikebivins From KATU, it appears that the explosion is due to a gas leak:	https://t.co/A5mYmUfwFk
@conradjwilson I hope the prosecution addresses this point in their closing. This is an insult to MLK and the civil rights movement.
@SwidSeor @publiclandlvr @NPR Very interesting website. Great info, thanks for sharing it! Take away: Utah is a weird place.
@BixJacks Point of order!! "I Feel Pretty" is from West Side Story, not The Sound of Music.
@Nord_Eh That moment when your testicles hit the side of a boat, &amp; you realize your going to be wearing wet clothes with sore balls all day.
@chris_zinda @karinapdx I had to learn quick when arguing with an anarchist on Daily Kos. Got ugly fast. I was "schooled" to put it politely
@chris_zinda @karinapdx Excellent article. Theo-cons r exactly what they r. But don't piss off the anarchists they have a belief system too.
@chris_zinda @karinapdx Bundy and Co. are not anarchists. They are theocrats, they require a governmental structure to achieve their goals.
@TikiJayne @Calivettech @goblin_seimen I think tomorrow will b Ryan's star turn. If he testified he could b crossed. Close can't be crossed.
@etherealspirits Bundys should just give up on grocery stores. The damn takeover started in a grocery store parking lot &amp; they forgot snacks
@etherealspirits Or that you can't buy a pack of ground beef, some chili powder, and seasonings, and make better chili than that canned crap
@skaterdood76 Dayum, Trump really does "win" all of the online polls! ;-)
@evenbev Not a chance I'm clicking on that. I'm having too good a day to ruin it.
@goblin_seimen Gavin is never bothered by facts. Knowing anything about anything would impede his ability to generate word salad.
@CTRNewsFeed @nancyann1968 @pirateannie16 @ElaineSoCal @CraigSh49850532 Not surprised, every revelation pushes back your "What I knew" show.
@CTRNewsFeed @nancyann1968 @pirateannie16 @ElaineSoCal @CraigSh49850532 Right, I am sure that there are ongoing investigations. #OpPootScoop
@Zelda23Pinwheel @progresvforever Yep, thank you!
@progresvforever The only thing that helps at this point is making sure that the vote turns out and the message to deplorables is understood
@progresvforever Polls aren't votes. Let's not get complacent. Trump is far too dangerous, and a message needs to be sent to his followers.
@Hellboy_OR @CapitalismHQ Woah Hellboy, gotta hit the hay. Nite nite time in NOLA.
@Hellboy_OR @CapitalismHQ Probably. With Paine or Cooper leading the training. No way to know. IIRC Payne let similar training.
@Hellboy_OR @CapitalismHQ If they were charged, they're not Gov. agents.
@Hellboy_OR @CapitalismHQ Apparently. They were leveraging Fabio's experience - 20 years in Swiss Army. Ammon thought Fabio was heaven sent.
@Hellboy_OR @CapitalismHQ Not really. If the leaders said, do this, and the CI's did it, then it's not complicated.
@Hellboy_OR @CapitalismHQ Same with McConnell, do you think he walked in and said he's Ammon's driver? Ammon trusted MM for security.
@Hellboy_OR @CapitalismHQ Would Fabio walk into MNWR and say grab your guns boys lets shoot the lake? Fabio was told to train the gunmen.
@Hellboy_OR @CapitalismHQ By Ammon or Ryan. Part of that log that Ammon kept about who was responsible for what.
@Hellboy_OR @CapitalismHQ  Mark was told to be AB's driver. Momma Bear was told to work the kitchen. Fabio was told to do weapons training.
@goblin_seimen Gawdam that was a waste of time. 3000 hours of time wasted by that vid, that's around 1.5 person years of work down the drain
@BixJacks Sounds like he wasn't scoring points, just settling scores.
@SeymoreBallz @etherealspirits @BixJacks What a slacker, only three counts. He's not a true pootriot until he hits double digits.
@AmonRaMCL @SphynxCatsRule Tellingly, yesterday he was hanging out in PDX, in the rain, with a bunch of seditionists not from OR. Vote 4 me!
@sagedrummer @SphynxCatsRule Nah, she's a future Seim. Like Gavin she'll never do anything illegal, just incite others &amp; make shit up.
@Juan_Abbe Can't be funny, no profanity.
@SphynxCatsRule For perspective: This is the guy that thought that Laz' rant yesterday made sense. 538 has Wyden +21 over this loser.
@Juan_Abbe That was a great show.
@NewMexlefty KK says it's an alias. He's talking to a PD prior to testifying.
@NewMexlefty I haven't seen any comment from Feds or prosecution. This looks like a poot paranoid freak out.
@leSCarGo2 @Shady_Mitt @SwidSeor @TheRealWaitWhat They wore their plumage hats &amp; body armor to better fit in. Invisible on high desert. https://t.co/jmdGlHdPg5
@NewMexlefty Nothing is evah SRB's fault! She would figured this out if Blaine Cooper hadn't been so adorbs. It's Facebook's fault too.
@etherealspirits @ElaineSoCal Pure conceit on their part. They assumed that the OK's, Threepers &amp; Militias provided vetting. Grifters grift.
@MandyM2S @NewMexlefty PS Shawna's filing courtesy of @jkryn . Thanks Jack, as always.
@MandyM2S @NewMexlefty Link to Shawna's filing:	https://t.co/RwtDAnPMJS https://t.co/T2ISFPhe0i
@NewMexlefty Until Linnell they assumed that Mark was the only informant. Now everyone is one. Kind of amusing. OK's &amp; Threepers will freak
@NewMexlefty That wasn't in the filing. I would assume not, it appears that he is enrolled in that class in AZ.
@mexicology @SphynxCatsRule I wonder if she was "naming names" of CHI's and someone took offense after being stalked. SRB's an idiot.
@NewMexlefty Last I read, in Shawna's filing, is that he is in PDX. He wants to leave for AZ soon so he can complete LE training.
@NewMexlefty @PaganInGeorgia Thanks NML, I wasn't sure if she stayed on the "farm" all of the time.
@PaganInGeorgia Has Momma Bundy gone anywhere since Bunkerville? Could she be dealt the same fate as Cliven in PDX?
@conradjwilson They wait until the last week of trial to begin cost/benefit analysis of witnesses? The "Ready, Fire, Aim" defense strategy.
@CandyHenderso19 @terrastomp @SphynxCatsRule Yep, just wait until fracking chems from OK and KS show up in the Ogallala Aquifer. Ugliness.
@NewMexlefty @TRKessler55 @BixJacks Cajun Mercs!	https://t.co/nVNIgmYMgz
@etherealspirits @amandapeacher  This vid, start around 23 minutes in and listen for a few minutes. Laz challenges Grasty, JAB, and Maxine https://t.co/hjADOh0jb9
@amandapeacher @conradjwilson @maxoregonian Poots seem to be predicting "an exciting day" tomorrow. Asking for everyone to come and join.
@amandapeacher @conradjwilson Keep your eyes open, Lazaro seems to think he going to confront JAB, Steve Grasty, and @maxoregonian tomorrow.
@Yikbug Pretty sure he spent more time designing the label than he did cleaning the kitchen before he started cooking.
@Nord_Eh @SphynxCatsRule I thought that was cute, they make a great couple. And she reminded him about Benghazi. They complete each other.
@Shady_Mitt @SphynxCatsRule Hers would be in crayon, a dead give away.
@SphynxCatsRule That is one hell of a rant. For those looking for Laz's threats, go to 23 mins from the end and listen for about 4 minutes.
@researcherwolf1 Carlie, do you think that SRB is hinting that Barb Berg is a CI too? Am I misreading the post?
@gunslinger59 Wow Tucker Carlson &amp; James O'Keefe in the same article. Thanks for the nightmares! I'll stick with the scary clowns thank you.
@progresvforever My guess is that this earns Clinton a 3 day honeymoon before they start back with their false equivalences and "scandals".
@goblin_seimen Cool music, who dat?
@cjcmichel IIRC a couple of their pages "liked" the Citizens for Constitutional Freedom (Ammon Bundy's group) page.
@kocisue9 Gavin's is one of the few pages on all three terrorists like list.
@SphynxCatsRule He forgot: And help me get rid of all of these apples!
@paidprovocateur BJ definitely went to the Ammon Bundy School of Business and Sedition. Ready! Fire! Aim!
@dsstella @ToniTagliarino @PaganInGeorgia @tonydphotog @ElaineSoCal @goblin_seimen Gavin heads east when any of consequence happens in PDX.
@cjmoose @HappyinaMini @kneice @UglyPortland 2 separate links in my post. One for Vanilla Isis, one for Ballad of The Oregon Standoff
@cjmoose @HappyinaMini @kneice @UglyPortland They are on YouTube:	https://t.co/CGVcvaM6iZ	https://t.co/VQtTmRD3sL
@tonydphotog @ElaineSoCal My money is on Brand Nu Thornton.
@HappyinaMini @cjmoose @kneice @UglyPortland That IS UglyPortland. On one of those vids you can hear his heartbeat. 180 bpm sitting. BadDude
