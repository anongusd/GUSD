I have one question, why the Congress of the US do not have the balls to impeach Obozo they have more than enough proof?
The amount of money that has been wasted on the Federal &amp; state level for Obama care could have provided healthcare for the uninsured
Congress need to do the job they where elected to do by the American people not heir own agenda
The American people need to wake up and stand up to the thugs that are protesting before they have the facts.
