Wow! Talk about being complicated and subjective to what interpretation which courts &amp; Congress decide 2 take. It's no wonder trump is doing his best 2 stack appointments &amp; official seats that will favor his line if thinking.     https://t.co/ZM0SylqvTa
If I understand this right, trump was facing at least 75 charges/lawsuits in Oct 2016 b4 he ran 4 office. First thing that poped in my head was, did he run 4 potus 2 avoid these 75 charges?       https://t.co/mBHFjreSt0

That is one of the weapons that the medical community issues 2 get women 2 terminate early. The other one is lack of social &amp; community acceptance.
@aanalyst50 @SenateGOP True that. Back in the early '70s we studied it in school and as compelling as it was then, no one took it seriously. Now we must take drastic measures. If they would have started earlier, it wouldn't cost so much now
@SenateGOP Sure we can and actually we don't have a choice in that if we want to live on this planet!

@reginambr @maleka_s @RafaelTman @realDonaldTrump So, miss smarty pants, there are many many reasons that terminations are needed. I had a pregnant friend in the early '90s that slipped on ice and wasn't visibility hurt, as I went down with her and she fell on top of me. She was checked out by her OB &amp; he said all was fine. .

@reginambr @maleka_s @RafaelTman @realDonaldTrump They had absolutely NO evidence at all, that anything could be otherwise not be "typical" (aka abnormal). They had gone as far 2 schedule me for the process w/o my consent. When I refused 2 sign consent, they dropped me as a patient like a hot potato in my 32 week of gestation
@reginambr @maleka_s @RafaelTman @realDonaldTrump If the Drs &amp; councilors had their way, my last child would have been aborted. Tho all screening tests were normal, they insisted that I abort due 2 my "advanced" maternal age ALONE! The genetic councilor &amp; Dr painted every possible &amp; horrific scenario possibly if I had this child
@reginambr @maleka_s @RafaelTman @realDonaldTrump Yeah, you hit a nerve alright! And you've got no idea what some women go thru &amp; the hard decisions that sometimes need 2 be made. I've had 13 pregnancies w/only 3 living children. Miscarriages that required D&amp;Cs, medically necessary terminations &amp; my last living child who has DS. https://t.co/UrYIlRTmTA

@QuakeDawg @Alyssa_Milano I don't. He's not eligible 2 get a reduced sentence 4 what he's already been sentenced 4. Plus, Cohen voluntary brought all documents he could 2 back up what he has said in court.Some he couldn't bring bc the Southern District of NY has them 4 their investigation trump.

@Gaz_70 @Alyssa_Milano Plus, Cohen has much incentive 2 tell the truth &amp; cooperate &amp; it's not 4 a reduced prison sentence as trump &amp; his Republicans are trying 2 make us believe.

@BeckiBintBob @Alyssa_Milano The best defense they could do 4 Trump was 2 make Cohen look uncrediable bc there is no GOOD defense 4 Trump. Cohen had documents 2 back up what he said in court. Republicans can't dispute documents.

Since Cohen is cooperating in all investigations, giving all documents he has etc..I believe that the country should provide security for them right now.

@electrikmonk @tkinso @NathanLerner @jimmcquiggin I understand that more than I ever have b4.. I think if there's any silver lining in this disaster we're facing, is that it has gotten ppl 2 get more understanding of our gov't &amp; political system. Great point you made!
@sar_marantoinet @RonaldKlain I also agree that any Dem's/Ind's (3rd parties) that have committed crimes,done questionable/obvious/shady bending of our rules &amp; regs, also need 2 be brought in2 the open,investigated,charged if guilty &amp; sentenced. I'd like us 2 really work on cleaning up our entire system.
@LeroyCrawford20 @RainJellyBeans @mattzap Or, Google Dr. John Gartner and see what he has 2 say on these types of ppl.  There's also a great clip on You Tube https://t.co/LUTq1FOGqR where you'll get a clearer perspective, if you're inclined to be a little more informed. Your choice tho. Isn't it nice 2 have a choice?

@reginambr @RafaelTman @maleka_s @realDonaldTrump IDK where you get your statistics from. .but abortions in the USA have been on a steady decline since Roe vs Wade became law.
@AntonioMarino58 @RafaelTman @maleka_s @realDonaldTrump And there are particular diagnostic tests that cannot be done in the early trimester. Do some research. Better yet, speak with a geneticist
@AntonioMarino58 @RafaelTman @maleka_s @realDonaldTrump The PLAN B pill is available to ALL young &amp; adult women. It's $50.00 &amp; requires no prescription or parents permission. Why would anyone chose an abortion, which costs a whole lot more financially &amp; emotionally &amp; has very definite health risks as a back up birth control?

@KipColvin @ShephardErika @JAAB78831732 @realDonaldTrump If you are a MEDICAL PHYSICIAN (MD), then you should know under which horrific circumstances such a late termination might be decided &amp; you would know how heart- retching it is if a patent (s) is complicating termination. I doubt your claim of being a physician
@JFincher70 @realDonaldTrump Being a man &amp; probably not a father who has ever had 2 face a devastating,unforseen circumstance,or medical personnel explaining the devastating future a child born w/rare, serious or fatal defects,you just need 2 hold your judgements or get more informed.

@realDonaldTrump @VP @GOP @NRA the blood of these children, the suffering of these families ARE ON YOU 4 not listening 2 OUR PROTESTS 4 GUN REFORM. INSTEAD YOU'VE IGNORED US, CAUSED AN UPROAR &amp; FALSE NARRATIVE OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS BEING TAKEN AWAY. IT'S ALL ABOUT THE $$ 4 YOU https://t.co/9C3XjguBeE
@jcvolt He's been confessing &amp; telling on himself since his campaign. It's all going 2 catch up 2 him PLUS he'll have the state of NY 2 deal with. Trump is so freak'in stupid, he doesn't realize what he's in for. The whole family is going down.
@AgarTron @vividjohn1 @riotwomennn @NorahODonnell @ScottPelley @60Minutes Proven Russian $ was involved in campaign; violations,$ laundering via trump, violated emoluments clause, high crimes, corruption,giving aid &amp; comfort 2 our enemies,misdemeanors, ethic violations, broken oath of office on so many counts.. There's going 2 be SO much more
@latearrival1973 @NorahODonnell @ScottPelley @60Minutes Lol, both fit!! I believe that Pence is guilty of smaller issues. Being complicit, enabling &amp; probably some violations concerning campaign $$ from NRA (has Russian $$ in that, maybe Saudi $$) Super Pac's.
@Allern @bar94boss @EvaChanda @MusgroveAndrew @NorahODonnell @ScottPelley @60Minutes Otherwise there wouldn't be so much evidence to the contrary. Almost Trump's entire inner circle have admitted corruption, been found guilty &amp;been charged. The best ones are yet to happen, and they will happen. Everything will come to light, it always does.
@Allern @bar94boss @EvaChanda @MusgroveAndrew @NorahODonnell @ScottPelley @60Minutes Those thorough investigations etc that you're speaking of were done by "New" Republicans,not bipartisan, due 2 top Gop's being blackmailed &amp; others pressured 2 agree by those that are compromised.

@EMAC1030 @EvaChanda @MusgroveAndrew @NorahODonnell @ScottPelley @60Minutes Yes, this is far worse than Watergate was. That was the only fact in your tweet. It's worse bc trump is not loyal to the United States. His loyalties are elsewhere and that's what makes this worse than Watergate
@bar94boss @EvaChanda @MusgroveAndrew @NorahODonnell @ScottPelley @60Minutes And how will you feel when you find out that it's not a hoax or a witch hunt? Are you going to deny the facts in continued ignorance?
@EvaChanda @MusgroveAndrew @NorahODonnell @ScottPelley @60Minutes Exactly
@EvaChanda @MusgroveAndrew @NorahODonnell @ScottPelley @60Minutes Indeed...not a coup.
@MusgroveAndrew @NorahODonnell @ScottPelley @60Minutes He was not elected by the American Ppl. Putin, Kremlin &amp; other Russian agents &amp; probably Saudi prince got trump elected. Not elected by Americans!

@KevinWhisnant01 @NorahODonnell @ScottPelley @60Minutes I believe you probably meant mutiny.Treason is what @realDonaldTrump, the #Trump Crime Family,  top @GOP &amp; others in trump's campaign &amp; inner circle have committed. FYI, the Ppl of the USA did not elect trump, Putin got him elected via $$ &amp; infiltrating our election system.
@AgarTron @vividjohn1 @riotwomennn @NorahODonnell @ScottPelley @60Minutes That shouldn't evolve them being allowed to infiltrate our gov't, our country &amp; elect our presidents via breaking our laws, using our system against us &amp; other criminal activities. The Russians will not RESPECT THE USA IF THAT'S ALLOWED &amp; SO FAR, THAT'S EXACTLY THE CASE!

@ABC @TheView The NRA(&amp; Rusdian $ via the NRA)is deeply in trump's pocket, he needs that $ 4 his 2020 campaign which is exactly why he won't address gun reform (which is NOT abt taking our constitutional right 2 own guns away).This letter from @realDonaldTrump &amp; @FLOTUS is a slap in the face

@TheView This is an insult 2 Americans everywhere. A slap in the face, a stab 2 the hearts of every family member who's lost a child/adult from school &amp;mass shootings. The NRA is in @realDonaldTrump 's pockets politically &amp; he will not support gun reform bc he's counting on them in 2020

@CrAzYhAwK121 @ananavarro I think if Justin Fairfax did do what he's accused of, then he definitely has 2 go. But, he's entitled to due process, just as we all are. It doesn't look good tho, with 2 credible accusers.
@CrAzYhAwK121 @ananavarro While I agree,however,Dr.N didn't commit a crime,nor was any1 hurt. He made a poor choice 30+yrs ago &amp; has been an upstanding,caring &amp; empathic person since. He's done so much good &amp; that should count &amp; mean something. Recent past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior
@Mysteri759 @ananavarro @graceslick77 Dr.N has been very good 4 Virginia. Definitely a bad/poor choice he made 30+ yrs ago, but he's not like that, he's really not a racist.  A very kind &amp; caring man w/much empathy. All parents, of all shades, of his patients love him &amp; speak highly of the caring Dr &amp; man that he is.
@ananavarro Justin Fairfax, has serious &amp; creditable allegations against him. He has a right 2 due process per law. Trump, his family &amp; inner circle have done a whole lot worse &amp; they're still in our WH! Now that's a real concern!
@ananavarro Thing abt Dr.N,many Virginian's got 2 know him pre-politics.He's treated many of our children,of all shades, religions &amp; backgrounds.He's cared compassionately 4 them all.Those who know him, know he's not a racist.He committed no crime,no 1 was hurt &amp;gave a public&amp;sincere apology

Just a min! @USoversight Has @FairfaxJustin been convicted of the crime yet? Did I miss the trial &amp; conviction?There's CREDIBLE testimony, granted. We also have MUCH CREDIBLE EVIDENCE 4 IMPEACHING @realDonaldTrump YET HE'S STILL IN OUR OVAL. Just say'in.   https://t.co/p8JwSEobv2
It's NOW OBVIOUS that @BrettKavanaugh lied, as most ppl knew he was &amp; that he is definitely part of the "stocking" of the courts via the Putin-trump regime.The political TERMITES are growing by leaps &amp; bounds,chewing away &amp; undermining our entire system.   https://t.co/l4SjsrN79m
I hope that Mueller has locked away indictments concerning this issue. I hope that the NY district is investigating trump's involvement in money  laundering &amp; I definitely support the @HouseDemocrats @USoversight in any investigations necessary 2 the truth https://t.co/UxxoptYv0L
Again,more avoiding answers by trump's picks 4 court seats.The courts are being stocked by those who will yield 2 the destruction &amp; take over of OUR GOV'T,OUR COUNTRY &amp; OUR DEMOCRACY.RESTRUCTURING 4 A DITATORSSHIP HAS COMMENCED VIA POLITICAL TERMITES  https://t.co/kHqZ6y7xdY
@LindseyGrahamSC @ChuckGrassley @SpeakerPelosi @chuckschumer It's plainly obvious, what is happening.The courts are being "stocked".Nominees &amp;confirmations 4 those who will yield the Putin-trump regime's goals in the destruction of our Gov't &amp; democracy.  https://t.co/Sj0ArCr4sZ
Because the words "BE BEST" DO SOUND/ARE ILLITERATE @FLOTUS. They are not in line with proper English &amp; Grammer structure. For a person who's contractual partner claims that you speak several languages fluently, "BE BEST" is a big TELL that says otherwise  https://t.co/c1xUAfRXqu
@LizCheney YOU DID NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION &amp; I'D LIKE 2 KNOW YOUR ANSWER. DO YOU SUPPORT A POTUS THAT BULLIES OTHERS &amp; MAKES REFERENCES TO GENOCIDES IN A JOKING TONE? THE FACT THAT YOU REPRESENT MANY NATIVES &amp; DID NOT CONDEMN trump's SNIDE TWEET IS CONCERN https://t.co/EiSZbxQx9A
WHY is it that Republicans DON'T GIVE DIRECT ANSWERS to DIRECT QUESTIINS? It's been a MORE PROGRESSIVE &amp; PROMINENT PATTERN via REPUBLICANS these last 2 yrs of trump's presidency. Why is that? THAT'S MORE OF MY CONCERN, THAT THEY DON'T ANSWER.  https://t.co/EiSZbxQx9A
If the Dems who want 2 wait 4 Mueller's report are concerned abt wanting 2 be sure that the American citizens R behind an impeachment process 4 trump, WHY DON'T ALL OF US WRITE 2 ALL OUR REPS w/OUR VOTES 2 PROCEED or NOT ON IMPEACHMENT -@SpeakerPelosi    https://t.co/TVKfW609oS
Does it work different in politics? Isn't a licensed,practicing,medical physician supposed 2 point out &amp; recommend 2 said patient if they see/find/suspect that the patient has something else that brings up a serious medical concern? Quack or negligence?   https://t.co/fSNBAzNcCp
@CrittersofAveB I think there's plenty that will stick but I believe that will be in the private sector. Politically, he's got too much help via Putin helping him to get away with murder.
@latearrival1973 @mehdirhasan I so very much agree, at least as far as the ones that have changed from the original Republican party to the "New Republican Party" that Trump likes to call them. They seem to be compromised. I really think we need 2 know if any signed NDA's w/trump
@ThomasDMalle @heather28df You need to have a certain% just to claim that you have Native ancestors?
@Brendan_Noble Bullies don't have any class
@thor_benson Warren's Family Ancestry DNA test showed she did have native ancestors. She never made the claim that she was 100% or half or any specific amount. As far as I'm concerned, she had no need to apologize bc I don't believe she ever claimed to be solely Native.That's just my opinion
@SaltyLilOjibwe Very well said!
@heather28df And that so called artist isn't much better than a POS
@heather28df I agree that Trump is being insulting, rude &amp; hurtful. Not to mention insensitive. His racism &amp; discrimination is deeply rooted in his insecurities.
@heather28df She may not be 100% Native but few of us are, in fact most don't come close 2 any % that would actually count.Yet, I've always heard per a different race of the one drop rule. Wouldn't this apply 2 ancestry? Idk. Looking 4 clarification. Does one need a certain% or what?

@ChrisJZullo @realDonaldTrump I don't think he (@realDonaldTrump) cares. He's got no respect for his own wife or young son. It's why her "Be Best" campaign is a complete failure/farce. Not sure she ( @FLOTUS) even cares.
@chris_klosowski @realDonaldTrump Wouldn't it?? Couldn't agree more.
@DLoesch Guess you don't exactly agree w/ @FLOTUS 's " BE BEST" campaign or setting a good example for the younger generation. Poor example of an adult &amp; definitely no role model 4 appropriate behavior. Do you have children of your own? Do you encourage children 2 mock others?Just asking
Bullying.  Wouldn't you say so @FLOTUS ?? Where does the "BE BEST" campaign of yours fit into this? Shouldn't adults set the example for our children 2 follow? How does Barron interpret his father's behavior?  And, NO, I'm not bullying you by asking these questions. https://t.co/cSA3BnDsG4
@CrittersofAveB I understand that. It's even harder 2 do when dealing w/a person that has NPD. Their so good at creating intricate webs, not being present when the actual crime or deed is done, that w/o professional (medical)help, it'll be hard 2 rope him in &amp; make it stick.
This is so sickening so appalling and I HATE FEELING HELPLESS. THE HYPOCRISY OF @FLOTUS &amp; @IvankaTrump who claim, FALSELY, to care about children. Neither of them will we allow off the hook.They will both be held as co-conspiraters for these crimes against humanity. https://t.co/Yp1AfVqIPM

@bostondg @CryoguyNort @PoliticsWolf @elwasson Ppl's principles, views &amp; priorities change as they age (w/very few exceptions,trump being 1 of those exceptions) &amp; gain wisdom. Wouldn't you agree? Shouldn't 1 be judged from their most current past behavior? Society's views &amp; acceptable behavior also change, wouldn't you agree?
@CryoguyNort @bostondg @PoliticsWolf @elwasson Except that the "offended party" HAVE BEEN FAIRLY REPRESENTED under Gov.Northam from the start &amp; he's not done or said anything to undermine that confidence since being elected to Governor. THAT'S WHAT THEY SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON, not a poor decision he made 30 yrs ago.
@bostondg @CryoguyNort @PoliticsWolf @elwasson What Northam &amp; Herring did was not a crime &amp; it did not physically harm anyone. Neither of them have done anything that could be considered racist in the past 3+ decades. In fact, they've represented ALL ppl in the Commonwealth of VA very fairly &amp; equally. That should count!!!
@CryoguyNort @bostondg @PoliticsWolf @elwasson If a Republican gets into the top office of Virginia, then it would be another notch in putin's belt &amp; the minorities in our state can kiss any progress we've made towards equality over the last century!  They're biting their nose off despite their face. .as they say.
@CryoguyNort @bostondg @PoliticsWolf @elwasson I think that Fairfax's accuation needs investigating. If it's proven that he is guilty of a crime that actually hurt some, then that would be worthy of asking 4 his resignation, naturally. Northam &amp; Herring committed NO CRIME &amp; THEY HURT NO ONE!
@LouRovegno @PoliticsWolf Lol... I've been feeling like that too. I bet many ppl have.
@pcpablow @PoliticsWolf That's what I'd like to see. I don't believe they'd fair well under the same scrutiny.
@TurkanaDK @PoliticsWolf They sure do!
@kazoo10s @PoliticsWolf They should be very weary of just that.  I would love 2 see their pasts looked into &amp; reported on..Publicly
@JacobKlainberg @PoliticsWolf Northam &amp; Herring have given public apologies. Neither of them have behaved in any racist way for decades. All they're guilty of is making a poor decision decades ago, which was not a crime &amp; hurt no one. Both have proven via their official service that they are not racists.
@johnlk_80 @PoliticsWolf Definitely that's what's at play here.
@kn_iden @VA_GOP There are so many Republicans that are racists, it's mind blowing. The Trump crime family is at the VERY TOP of that list &amp; it's so very easy to find documentation of ALL OF IT, yet they say nothing about it, not one single word!!  Is that not the very definition of HYPOCRISY?
@pollyollydoodle @VA_GOP Another GREAT EXAMPLE of the long standing hypocrisy of the GOP.
@Saintsfan5348 @VA_GOP I AGREE. THERE IS  CONSTANT &amp;  RAMPANT ( AND A LONG HISTORY OF) HYPOCRISY WITH IN THE GOP. It's not just that a few have made past or curent poor decisions or made a bad choices in their pasts. IT'S BEEN FOREVER THEIR HISTORY.
@VA_GOP NO, I DO NOT AGREE WITH THAT.		 YOU ARE NOT SPEAKING FOR ALL VIRGINIANS.		 I HAVE NOT LOST ANY TRUST IN/ OR OF/ THEIR MORAL AUTHORITY -- IN EITHER NORTHAM'S OR HERRING'S, TO GOVERN. 		MANY PPL IN VA FEEL THE WAY THAT I DO.
@Saintsfan5348 @VA_GOP This is so true.Trump has a long &amp; documented  history of racism, yet I hear nothing about that from the GOP. In fact, the very opposite is so. They are perfectly fine with trump's history, both his past &amp; current behavior. I do not understand that at all. Pence isn't much better
@VA_GOP Herring, may have committed a crime that, if proven so,would have caused physical &amp; mental harm 2 another. That deserves attention &amp; investigation of, per our laws.
@VA_GOP I personally know that Northam cares about ALL ppl.He has shown that in his medical practice. Every parent of his patients can affirm that w/out any reservation whatsoever. It's time 2 forgive &amp; let it go. Except the apologies given. That is what we're supposed 2 do per God.
@VA_GOP ...participating, need 2 put this matter into perspective. Neither Northam or Herring committed a crime, they did not physically hurt anyone. They're only guilty of making a poor choice decades ago &amp; neither have any recent behavior that indicates that they are racists.
@VA_GOP I have no doubt that this was done on purpose 2 sow more division &amp; chaos.The political termites of the putin-trump regime are so busy at chewing away at our republic democracy from within, bite by bite, they are accomplishing their goal &amp; those in the GOP that are ...
@VA_GOP Sincere public apologies have been made &amp; WE need to forgive them &amp; move forward. Persecution should be reserved 4 those ppl who have not not changed in their behavior of racism &amp; continue to perpetuate, practice &amp; encourage it, presently. Trump &amp; Pence would be 2 of those ppl.
@VA_GOP I hope that they are given the opportunity to make amends, to those who feel betrayed. I have not lost confidence in their ability to lead in their official capacities, as they have both shown/proven that they are highly capable of representing ALL ppl of Virginia.
@VA_GOP I believe that Northam's &amp; Herring's recent past 3 decades of behavior &amp; integrity should speak volumes 2 their characters today. I have no doubt that if you were 2 look into EVERYONE'S PAST, you'd find some sort of skeleton that they'd be ashamed of. Human beings are not perfect
@VA_GOP Both Northam &amp; Herring committed NO CRIME &amp;SHOULD NOT RESIGN! What they did decades ago was offensive &amp; I'm sure they regret doing what they did.

@sam_granny @ThisWeekABC @NAACP @GStephanopoulos @DerrickNAACP @delegatebagby Thank you! !! I'm saying the same thing. This is ridiculous. We need 2 stay focused on getting trump &amp; pence out. Political termites are at play here. Wondering if minorities think they're going to fair better under a VERY RACIAL REGIME. I can't stand fake victims either.
@delegatebagby Not good enough 4 me to put my child in school in VA.
@delegatebagby I swear I'm so sick of this.Northam is a Great Gov.Plz read my comments on @VaBlackCaucus . We've got 2 stop falling 4 the putin-trump termites...seriously, we have 2 stay focused on trump &amp; 2020. Think black ppl/or any other minority is going to fair well under trump/pence?
@CNN @delegatebagby That's bs.We can definitely heal,come on now.Seems 2 me that our black representatives in VA want Trump re-elected in 2020.They're playing the game&amp; allowing the Putin trump regime's termites 2 eat away at our  state, Why? Are they going 2 fair better under a racial dictatorship
@delegatebagby No..I do not think he should resign. Please see my posts as to why @VaBlackCaucus
@ThisWeekABC @delegatebagby @GStephanopoulos @DerrickNAACP I do not feel Gov. Northam should resign. Please read my comments as to why @VaBlackCaucus
@delegatebagby please read my comments that I posted on @VaBlackCaucus Thank you.
@VaBlackCaucus Guess I should state that I live in Virginia. .and I am a voter.
@doug_laydon @VaBlackCaucus @SenateDems And ..until proven otherwise. .it's an accusation of sexual assault. She has stated that the allegation is of forced oral sex...she did not say rape
@VaBlackCaucus Typo. . Should have been...The progress we've made since the midterms.
@doug_laydon @VaBlackCaucus @SenateDems I'm not OK with that. I didn't say I was OK with that. I said it needs to be investigated. Don't put words in my mouth. Read what I said and don't insert your words. There's no hidden meaning.
@VaBlackCaucus ..about racism, inequality &amp; injustice. ..WE CANNOT HAVE TRUMP RE-ELECTED...ALL OF US NEED TO KEEP OUR FOCUS THERE.  Thanks 4 letting me have my say.
@VaBlackCaucus ..not the Republicans of the old party. Trump has told us that himself. It's the NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY.While our Republican reps in our cities &amp; local levels may be of the OLD Republican party, the TOP ONES ARE NOT. They are aligned w/trump &amp; therefore Putin. If we're concerned. .
@VaBlackCaucus ..back &amp; out of their control. We won't be able to do that if we allow them to destroy the process we've made since the midterms. I can't imagine the USA in a dictatorship, with Putin calling the shots for decades to come. We have to keep in mind that the top Republicans are...
@VaBlackCaucus ..who feel betrayed. Give him that chance. Don't let it throw our state into chaos. Don't we have enough of that to deal with in our nation's capitol? This is exactly what the Putin-trump regime wants to happen. Please don't allow them to do it. We have to get our country. .
@VaBlackCaucus .. Isn't any better than trump, and I'd venture to say that if his past &amp; his family's past were looked into, I'd bet we'd find a lot to be worried about. I'd like to suggest that we Virginiaian's FORGIVE Gov. Northam &amp; allow him the opportunity to gain the trust back of those. .
@VaBlackCaucus I'd just like us all to keep in mind, that trump himself is a TRUE RACIST. He didn't just make one poor choice. He &amp; his family have a very long documented history of so much racism, it isn't even funny. Not only of black Americans but of many races &amp; religions. Pence isn't any..
@VaBlackCaucus Their goal is to sow discourse, to cause separation, invoke doubt &amp; mistrust AND WE'RE FALLING FOR IT. THEY'RE USING WHATEVER MEANS THEY CAN 2 ACCOMPLISH THEIR GOAL. I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN.
@VaBlackCaucus ...this any other way, or make it any clearer...The Putin-trump regime are political termites.After the midterms, when our country sent a definite msg to the illegitimate potus, they deployed MANY MORE "working termites" to undermine ALL DEMOCRATS in offices, in ALL STATES. ..
@VaBlackCaucus Doesn't anyone else find it VERY SUSPICIOUS that all 3 of these DEMOCRATIC representatives had dirt pulled up on them within the same time frame? Who's left in the succession if all 3 were to resign or otherwise leave office? A REPUBLICAN representative? I  can't say. ..
@VaBlackCaucus Whatever happened between Justin Fairfax &amp; Dr. Vanessa Tyson does require looking in2, bc that could very well be a serious crime. Not saying he's guilty of it, just saying bc of the accusation, that justifies further looking into.
@VaBlackCaucus ..expense of another's character assignation. Up until this happened, I liked him, a lot, as part of Virgina's representatives. This is his current behavior that I'm basing my thoughts on, not of his behavior 30+ years ago.
@VaBlackCaucus ..Governor's position. He didn't stay neutral or reserve his snap judgment until he could speak/discuss things w/ Northam. Didn't give me any feelings that he was a team player within our state representatives. I got the distinct thought that he was out to get promoted at the. .
@VaBlackCaucus As far as Fairfax, I'm concerned that he was so fast 2 not have Northam's back. He works w/Northam &amp; should have spoken out to Northam's current character &amp; integrity. It appeared 2 me that he threw him under the bus at 1st opportunity in hopes of getting promoted 2 the....
@VaBlackCaucus ..so much good 4 Virginia? The past is in the past. We can't live in the past and expect to move forward. It doesn't work that way. Same 4 Herring. No crime, no one hurt. His current character should also count 4 something. .
@VaBlackCaucus ...ppl in this state..not just one race, but ALL PPL in Virginia. He did not commit a crime, no one was hurt &amp; he sincerely apologized for a poor &amp; offensive decision of 30 yrs ago. He is an advocate for ALL ppl, why would we want 2  throw him under the bus when he can do so..
@VaBlackCaucus ..character? Ppl grow, not just physically but in all other aspects as well. Why does that not count? Should we all be judged solely on a past mistake, forever? What more could he possibly do that he hasn't already? He's a really good Governor 4 Virginia. He's represented ALL...
@VaBlackCaucus ..As a physician, he cared 4 children of all shades &amp; all his patients &amp; their parents loved &amp; spoke highly of him. As a Governor, has he done or said anything that is racial 2 anyone? Why can we not form our opinions of him based on the last several decades of his outstanding..
@VaBlackCaucus ...1st &amp; foremost. Gov.Ralph Northam sincerely &amp; publicly apologized.Has ANY of his behavior or deeds over the past 3+ decades indicated any racism in his character? Not that I've seen or heard of. In fact, I've only seen &amp; heard of the kind &amp; caring person he is 2day...
@VaBlackCaucus ..that. My point here is this. While posing in a photo in black face or a KKK robe/hood or applying black/white face 4 costumes/arts  is very offensive today, it isn't a crime &amp; no one was physically hurt. Those in this week's "headlines" (Northam/Herring /Fairfax) are ppl...
@VaBlackCaucus ..aren't we supposed 2 forgive? That is what I was taught. Forgiving isn't always easy, I admit, sometimes it's very hard 2 do, especially if someone's actions, poor choices &amp; bad decisions hurt or took a loved one's life. But I've seen it happen even under circumstances like...
@VaBlackCaucus ..of us be judged solely on a mistake, a poor decision made or a bad choice from our past? I would hope not, ESPECIALLY if our behavior, attitude, actions &amp; deeds have changed. Don't we all learn from making those mistakes? Most ppl do, IMO....
@VaBlackCaucus Our society has come a long way, in the right direction, even if it has been slow going. We still have a lot more to go towards equality. All of us has something in our past that we have to be sorry for, to make amends 4. We're human beings &amp; none of us are perfect. Should all..
@VaBlackCaucus ..the facts. It was done. The past is the past. No one can go back in time &amp; undo an action or un-say words.

@VaBlackCaucus I think if you were to look in2 just about anyone's past (who is caucasian), who grew up in the '20s- '80s, you'd be able 2 find something like this.Racism was taught via parents. It's part of our nation's history. During the '60s-'80s most caucasian parents started 2 change....

@JaneJone11 @laura575 @SethAbramson He really is a kind &amp; caring man TO ALL PPL. If you've ever met him you'd know he is not a racist. He truly cares about everyone.

@laura575 @SethAbramson I believe Dr. N's current &amp; last couple+ of decades of integrity &amp; values should prevail over a (possible) poor choice from the '80s. I've NEVER experienced or HEARD from other parents (of ALL shades &amp; backgrounds) of any behavior that would support the claim of him being racist

@ReneeHoagenson He's actually a very kind man &amp; respectful to all ppl. I was shocked to see the picture bc it does not reflect the Dr that I've known &amp; taken my child to. He made a bad choice back then, but it's not reflective of the man he is now. I don't believe he's a racist.

@LVozzella @RalphNortham Those large religious donors need to be taxed as any other business since they want to act as such in our politics.
@LVozzella @RalphNortham @GOP doesn't care about this issue. They only care about the large religious donors money coming into their campaigns. Take that possibility out of the equation &amp; the @GOP would NEVER BRING THE SUBJECT UP. If they really cared, they'd provide services for those babies lives.

@LVozzella @FirstLadyVA @GovernorVA There isn't a racial bone in his body. A GREAT Dr &amp; Gov. Plz DO NOT RESIGN. You're doing a great job as our Governor. Everyone has made mistakes, we're human. This poor decision you made back then, does NOT DEFINE WHO YOU ARE TODAY, NOR SHOULD IT.
@VickerySec Well that's scary as hell!
@InsideEdition He's a good man. Imo, he is not a racist. I've never witnessed or heard anyone speak bad of him.  His patients were a rich diversity of ppl. All those that I've ever spoke to, spoke highly of him, and so do I.
@CNN Dr. Northam is a good man. Ppl of all shades speak highly of him. Ppl should be more concerned about trump, pence, kavanaugh and many other's behaviors in offices.
@justinjm1 He didn't deny it. He owned it &amp; sincerely apologized 4 it. He really is a very kind man who cares about ALL ppl, of all shades. Ppl should be more concerned about trump, pence &amp; kavanaugh..all EXTREMELY racist. Dig into their pasts &amp; see what you find.
@MarkKeam @RalphNortham Dr Northam has treated all ppl, of all shades, with kindness &amp; respect. Yes, that was a very bad decision he made to pose 4 that photo. But who hasn't made a mistake in their past. I'm sure that if someone wanted 2 dig in2 another's past, we'd all have a skeleton or 2.
@geoff__morris @NSaneMotivation He made a very bad decision 2 pose 4 that photo back in the '80s--true. However, Dr. Northam's character is not at all racist. He's always treated his patients, of all shades, w/kindness &amp; respect.

@Phillyfann No, it won't. It won't stop criminals &amp; won't stop drugs.

@The_Trump_Train It's also legal in the US, for horses &amp; dogs 2 be slaughtered 4 human consumption. It's legal 2 leave homeless billions of wildlife 4 deforestation ($$). Should we go into puppy mills, or taking away a calf from their mother right after birth as they bellow out 4 their babies
@The_Trump_Train In the US it's also legal 2 buy dolphins &amp; whales from poachers 4 human entertainment, perpetuating the slaughter of thousands of family pods. It's legal 4 Co's 2 do cruel animal testing &amp; medical experimentation. It's legal 2 break the necks of animals 4 fur coats.

Trump has already back talked that bc he has been informed of the consequences. He caved in just an hr or so ago. Gov't will be reopened &amp; negotiations will commence. He won't be getting a wall.
@jamron44 @1Kingsley @incognito51 @Bwalkercox @joshdavisss @GaleB0420 @senatemajldr Trump can claim what he wants, proving it is a different story. Congress would step in bc an emergency is something that needs action immediately &amp; trump has already said, he's thinking about doing that. If there's time 2 think about taking action, then it's not an emergency....
@jamron44 @1Kingsley @incognito51 @Bwalkercox @joshdavisss @GaleB0420 @senatemajldr IT'S BEEN ON THE DECLINE ACROSS THE ENTIRE SOUTHERN BORDER

Now the wall is a ...
@jamron44 @1Kingsley @incognito51 @Bwalkercox @joshdavisss @GaleB0420 @senatemajldr Trump is the one in the corner &amp; he's not liking it much. No, it's not "whatever" I want 2 call it.There won't be any NEW  physical wall of any kind. You'll see. No need 2 argue over it.Trump &amp; the Republicans had control over ALL branches of our gov't 4 two yrs. Why didn't. .
@warloc1212 @DisavowTrump20 @TeamPelosi I don't understand the 2nd part of your comment. How trump was able 2 steal the office of potus has many factors 2 it &amp; if you're not aware of them, then it's too long 2 go into. But over 2/3 of the country did not vote 4 him. Maybe you could research all that on your own.
@jamron44 @1Kingsley @incognito51 @Bwalkercox @joshdavisss @GaleB0420 @senatemajldr Trump isn't getting a wall. ..
@jamron44 @1Kingsley @incognito51 @Bwalkercox @joshdavisss @GaleB0420 @senatemajldr Plus the gov't, per the law, has 2 pay 2 property owners a fair value of any land taken in a imminent domain claim. Many along the river use that water for their cattle's livelihood.That money or the court costs of doing so, have not been figured into the cost of the wall.
@jamron44 @1Kingsley @incognito51 @Bwalkercox @joshdavisss @GaleB0420 @senatemajldr ..and 2 add 2 that, there are properly owners that don't want their land taken &amp; they have said they will fight in courts over imminent domain claims. Can't take property away claiming imminent domain unless gov't can prove it's for the common good &amp; the gov't will lose that...
@jamron44 @1Kingsley @incognito51 @Bwalkercox @joshdavisss @GaleB0420 @senatemajldr And it would violate 20 some agreements that we've had  between us &amp; Mexico. It's actually illegal 4 the USA 2 put up physical barriers in a large section of the proposed area.The law suits alone would be expensive &amp; long drawn out.Then there's the environmental/wildlife issues..
@jamron44 @1Kingsley @incognito51 @Bwalkercox @joshdavisss @GaleB0420 @senatemajldr Potus will not get a wall. The majority of the United States citizens do not want a wall. And everyone, but trump, knows a wall will be ineffective.There's newer, better, less expensive technology that will provide security 4 our country &amp; no one will be scammed out of their land
@jamron44 @1Kingsley @incognito51 @Bwalkercox @joshdavisss @GaleB0420 @senatemajldr The proof that she was here in 1996 is a rental agreement, a roomate's account of the fact, along w/his knowledge of her photo shoots. Also the photographer, himself, has verified all that info. There's also the dated photo shoots via the magazines &amp; the model agency contracts.
@jamron44 @1Kingsley @incognito51 @Bwalkercox @joshdavisss @GaleB0420 @senatemajldr ..have been those who have come here on visas,&amp; stayed after they expired.Melania, herself was in NYC in 1996, w/expired visa &amp; doing model shoots.There is solid proof of that, but both Melania &amp; Donald have covered that up &amp;deny it. They both claim she came here in 1997 w/a visa
@jamron44 @1Kingsley @incognito51 @Bwalkercox @joshdavisss @GaleB0420 @senatemajldr That's not a false statement, #'s of illegalls have declined over the last decade.Dem's have never, ever said they wanted a border WALL. They've always maintained that they wanted better border security &amp; fair, comprehensive immigration reform. The biggest issue with illegals. ..
@jamron44 @1Kingsley @incognito51 @Bwalkercox @joshdavisss @GaleB0420 @senatemajldr No, it doesn't. Illegal crossings have been on a decline 4 over a decade now, same w/drugs. Trump has been provided those facts &amp; dismissed them, bc that doesn't serve his goal. He has no concern about those issues. The proof of that is via him leaving our country vulnerable.
@jamron44 @Bwalkercox @joshdavisss @GaleB0420 @senatemajldr By leaving our fed workers out/unpaid/furloughed 4 this long, what does that tell you about trump's so called "concern" for our national security? It tells us that this is NOT REALLY HIS CONCERN AT ALL. PLUS, HE'S HALTED THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION ON HIMSELF. KREMLIM IS HAPPY
@jamron44 @Bwalkercox @joshdavisss @GaleB0420 @senatemajldr Yes. Some drugs can be liquidated &amp; cross over w/no detection at legal points of entry. They can come by sea, by air, by underground &amp; across from our Northern borders. A wall is not going 2 stop/deter anything that isn't already happening. They just find a different way.
@warloc1212 @DisavowTrump20 @TeamPelosi I differ w/your statement. I believe that MOST ppl DO THINK b4 reacting, at least mature ppl do. Ppl, like trump,however,don't, they're incapable of thinking past their own interests &amp; they react out of compulsion rather than a rational place. Trump has a serious disorder, NPD
@NightShade10 @DisavowTrump20 @PamCollier2 @TeamPelosi In democracy,a potus doesnt get 2 give demands &amp; ultimatums.Taking hostages is what terrorists do, so that right there speaks volumes! If @realDonaldTrump really cared about our national security,he wouldn't have kept our fed workers down this long,leaving our country vulnerable
@paf_2 @DisavowTrump20 @TeamPelosi She did via letters,twitter &amp; at the mic.He just doesn't listen &amp; he's not willing 2 open the gov't unless he 100% gets the entire amount ($5.7) for his wall from the get-go. The fact that our fed gov't has been down this long, proves he really doesn't care about our security
@MrBill_Slugo @DisavowTrump20 @TeamPelosi Trump doesn't like hearing "NO" &amp; Nancy has told him NO re: his SOTU address. He's forced 2 abide, which he loathes &amp; 2 be told NO by a woman is just icing on the cake!
@aepotter @DisavowTrump20 @CherylKlich @TeamPelosi Lol..He should be shouldn't he!! Hehe!! Yes, new &amp; newer technology is less expensive, better protection, quicker 2 implement &amp; it wouldn't involve taking ppl's land away. That $5.7 doesn't include paying ppl 4 their land via imminent domain or the court costs in doing so.
@Zjeff2 @DisavowTrump20 @TeamPelosi I know, right! Maybe the Dems could say that we'll temporarily give trump the 5.7$$? Think he'd except that?
@warloc1212 @DisavowTrump20 @TeamPelosi It's a lot more than that.This border wall BS is 2 keep the public distracted while they try 2 restructure our gov't 4 authoritarianism. It's also designed to halt the Mueller investigation from advancing.The courts can't subpoena witnesses. It also keeps us venerable 2 attacks
@Gman349 @GADCMS @DisavowTrump20 @TeamPelosi Actually an agreement was made in both the House &amp; Senate &amp; trump said he was going 2 sign it- remember?. then Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity &amp; Laura (?) from Fox news told trump not 2 sign it &amp; he listened to them. Fox news must have somehow donated a large amount of $ 2 his campaign
@KNassre @bannerite @DisavowTrump20 @TeamPelosi That's not a bad idea at all,by 2020, he'll be out.That money could possibly go in2 a trust specified broadly 4 "border security".There's no way he can have a project that large &amp; all encompassing done by 2020.The amount he wants doesn't include property taken via imminent domain

I had bought a purse at a garage sale in Chula Vista one Fri, &amp; I went w/ friends that eve 2 eat dinner in TJ. Got thru in2 Mexico just fine. Coming home, in2 the US was a different thing
@BenFrankB @RepRickLarsen @USDA They also use Dogs 2 sniff out drugs &amp; other things,whether you're driving/walking across the border, you are checked, your vehicle is checked, if you have any items you bought/bags of merchandise are checked, your IDs are checked, you're asked questions.They're pretty thorough
@BenFrankB @RepRickLarsen @USDA Actually they do check all vehicles,  &amp; ppl going in or out at the border toll in San Diego.

@hellokitty11277 @krassenstein Lol..I was thinking that too
@ashleyb8255 @krassenstein I know, right! I'm surprised trump hasn't moved a McDonald's into the WH
@lifesafeast @krassenstein @JohnBlecka Lmbo... Now that I'd love to see! The last thing most would expect to be served (for a meal ) at the WH, is fast food!  Insulting IMO
@krassenstein I can't tell if those are lights on the walls in the background or oil/candle lamps. Was the electric shut off ?
@krassenstein He's so long winded the food (for a lack of a better word) was probably cold &amp; mushy. Yuck! And fast food by candlelight?? Was that to make it more special somehow?  Lol,  I don't get it. Seems insulting to me.
