Passing small-donor public financing would send a message to the nation that even in the age of #CitizensUnited, transformative change to take back democracy for everyday people is still possible. Read our full report for more! https://t.co/6SG5OZhObR
This is the year to enact small donor public financing. By taking this step, New York would lead the nation. It would be the first to enact a robust small donor matching program statewide.
The total cost of small donor public financing, including the matching funds and administering the program, would be less than a penny per day per New York State resident.
It would free legislators to better represent their constituents. It would curb corruption. It would respond to the explosion of civic engagement seen in the 2018 election and boost it further. And it would enhance public confidence. https://t.co/Ddb3XX8ok1
Small-donor public financing would not only amplify the voice of the people, it would also bolster the diversity of donors, officeholders, and candidates.
In 2018, small donations of $175 and below made up less than 5% of the total donations to New York State candidates in 2018. If New York had small-donor public financing and it was used by all candidates in 2018, the small donations would have made up 30%.
How does small donor public financing work? Constituents who give $175 or less to participating candidates will see their contributions matched by public money. @NYGovCuomo's current proposal would provide a $6-to-$1 match on each private contribution for qualifying candidates.
Countering big money in elections would help transform New York politics. Now, New York State has a chance to take a bold step to strengthen democracy: enacting small donor public financing.
In 2018 alone, the top 100 individual donors to New York State candidates gave more than all of the roughly 137,000 small donors combined — drowning out the voice of the people.

Trump no doubt thinks he looks more reasonable because he gave Congress plenty of time to act before declaring an emergency. The truth is the exact opposite, as Brennan Center expert @LizaGoitein explains: https://t.co/3PgjnxtWLL https://t.co/tnHdBITBCb

.@WendyRWeiser: The @BrennanCenter has been working on the issues in #HR1 for more than two decades. We innovated a lot of these reforms, which we've been working on advancing at both state and federal levels. #ForThePeopleAct
"The message is clear: The best way to respond to attacks on our democracy is to strengthen our democracy. 		That is what #HR1 does. It includes the key reforms needed to revitalize American democracy." -Brennan Center expert, @WendyRWeiser on the #ForThePeopleAct https://t.co/RpmX8spHLq
Renewing the Voting Rights Act is critical to address race discrimination. There’s a whole range of voting rights provisions in #HR1 that set minimum federal standards that prevent the kind of shenanigans that have been used in a discriminatory way to restrict access to voting.
.@WendyRWeiser: #HR1 is not about giving money to politicians, it’s about boosting the voices of the ordinary Americans who are giving the political contributions, and that is actually a strength of the system, not a weakness. #ForThePeople https://t.co/oH6cLRaAqE https://t.co/1IAcsyBCg2

These claims would almost be funny if they weren’t being used to deprive eligible citizens of their right to vote. Texas has a history of using faulty claims of fraud to justify onerous voter ID laws.
2. Large-scale database matching has been proven to be notoriously unreliable.	3. Similar claims made by states in the past — including Texas — have been debunked.		In fact, nearly every instance of such claims is thoroughly disproven.
We’ve seen this game before. Here’s why it doesn’t pass the smell test:		1. It is very likely that many if not most of these people became naturalized citizens since the last time they renewed their driver’s license.
This latest (and likely erroneous) claim from Texas is part of a larger pattern of vote suppressors making outlandish claims of voter fraud – only to have them thoroughly and exhaustively debunked. https://t.co/viH3Dw7W6f

Today's signing marks a big step for New York toward a modern election system. But it should be just the beginning. Cuomo has signaled his support for even farther-reaching democracy reforms like automatic voter registration and small donor public financing in 2019.
The legislation marked the first measures to be introduced in the 2019 legislative session and passed in the New York State Senate last Monday. The Brennan Center has long supported early voting and long advocated for closing the LLC loophole — both in court and in Albany.
