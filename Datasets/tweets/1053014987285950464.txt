Julian Castro - The Democrats Critical Choice for POTUS 2020
@RobertBona That sounds like a great idea we will share with this who can get it done. Cc: @JulianCastro
To be honest we don’t want you to #BoycottTrumpPrimeTime - We want you to truly listen with minds and hearts and hear through the words that mean nothing to find the truth and find the context if there is any. @realDonaldTrump come clean.
Julian Castro “ In part, he said it’s his Democrat values — like his support for universal health care, affordable housing and rebuilding infrastructure — but also because his track record in elected positions shows he’s a good fit for the job”	.	.	.	https://t.co/ThPbZuGKTP
#Castro2020 "I think it says something, that if a candidate doesn't take that money, they're going to work for you," he said. "If I'm elected, that's what I'm going to do." 	.	.	.	https://t.co/t6tpVXlziL
@janus_ExPat @_waleedshahid @AOC That escalated rapidly - Julian Castro as I am sure every voters wants EQUAL CONTRIBUTION to be paid
@TwerkTwigler That definitely makes sense and will be relayed - equitable should be fair and reciprocal but we know it’s all in perspectives of how the current administration has twisted words - we now all dissect meaning! Will share
@AirForceColone1 @SenWarren @OcasioCortez @TeamCavuto Colonel, thank you for your service. You as a tactician should know better than to fall for IO campaign played to sound bites. Castro is definitely stating equality he did not use the words you claim. Also, Castro did much to help keep San Antonio key for Heavies to keep flying

OK @SATairport to key cities internationally, &amp; his staff built international relationships with sister city development &amp; diplomacy #castro2020 @ThisWeekABC @GStephanopoulos #nato #apac #emea
@JulianCastro has the experience to be Commander In Chief! As Mayor of San Antonio, he &amp; his administration were critical to supporting the @USArmy @usairforce , growing @BrookeArmyMed - Castro worked with military leaders in #Texas to make SA a Key #Military Cyber Center #POTUS
@edgray1906 @Bdsteptoe @BudKennedy @rossramsey Julian Castro - brings the National Insight to the Local Level and his future can ignite the people! It is time for 2020 decisions to be made today! #Castro2020

@Vetivera24 Castro, will and should be the front runner for POTUS, and @realDonaldTrump knows this.
@VladDavidiuk You would be surprised how many moderates and even some Republicans feel when they actually read his responses and actions taken is lost roles.. Castro is the only candidate ready to take on the challenges left by this administration #castro2020
@SierraMcAliney @PodSaveAmerica @jonlovett @JulianCastro Julian Castro has led the 7th largest city to great economic development. He understands YOUR/ OUR challenges #castro2020
@JaneHWBB @InspiringU2 Castro by far the most experienced even at the International Diplomat Level. He and his staff were critical to setting then foundation for international business moving to Texas and crucial to making the city a major International travel &amp; business destination #economy #trumpout
Castro may not be the Fresh Face but he is the candidate with the experience that counts at all levels of government while still maintaining the integrity of the people first! #castro2020 https://t.co/A6onFxRQl1

Many candidates will hit the Democrat field with relatability when it comes to experience ~ But you won’t find the breadth and depth that arrives with JULIAN CASTRO for POTUS.  #potus #castro2020 #SundayBrunch
EXPERIENCED:	2 Term City Council in 7th largest city in US	Elected Mayor - worked with Republicans &amp; Democrats to boost the economy 	National Level - HUD Secretary Led homeowner increase across entire US &amp; decreased homelessness in Veterans &amp; key issues to return housing market
EXPERIENCE THAT MATTERS:Julian Castro was the Mayor who led efforts for investments in mass transit to stimulate job creation and clean up the environment	#greenenergy #masstransit #via #castro2020
Julian Castro was the leader getting San Antonio to become Military and Cyber-security center of excellence ~ The economy boomed and unemployment was at an all time low #leadership #Entrepreneur #POTUS #mayor
