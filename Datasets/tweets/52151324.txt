@SonrisaCooper Agreed, this is an urgent issue that needs to be part of the larger conversations on issues like access to #loans, #housing, #education and basic needs like food. #TechEquity
-@ACLU_NorCal shares we need consumer protections and awareness on #ai 	-@hackthehood shares we need young people at the table to lead this  work! #GenZ will be most impacted by #AlgorithmicRacism and need to be at the forefront of #TechEquity.
Some twakeaways from our #TechEquity meeting:	-@LeaderSpring shares we need to connect this to the larger issue of #discrimination. 	-@ai4allorg we need reparations and #justice! 	-@VinhcentLe #AlgorithmicRacism is replicating our history of #racism in a new way.
@HaleemaTheB @VinhcentLe An #algorithm is a set of steps or a recipe that are plugged into a formula to result in a certain outcome. Algorithms are usually created to solve a problem. #TechEquity
@karmannyc Georgia State University used predictive #algorithms to find students at risk of not graduating and invited those students to meet with advisers. They closed the graduation gap for low-income, first-generation and PoC students and boosted STEM graduation rates!
@karmannyc Creations like Bloc help students of color create resumes using algorithmic resume software. The software notes keywords and other factors that the  #algorithms look for at big companies, making their resumes more likely to be selected for next steps.
@NYJACL @amazon Where are the #reparations? 		@ai4allorg and @LeaderSpring thank you for making this demand. We need #resources in our community.
@hackthehood @VinhcentLe Research shows that this software tends to score language typically used by white men higher than the language used by other applicants.  Accordingly, a disproportionate number of applications by white men are given high scores and moved to the next step in the hiring process.
@hackthehood @VinhcentLe Many large companies use #algorithims that review application materials and gives those materials a score based on factors like education and work history, but also on what kind of language the applicant used.
@karmannyc @HaleemaTheB Part of the issue stems from the lack of #diversity in #tech. We need more coders of color - who are in high level positions. 		But that‚Äôs just one piece of #AlgorithmicRacism.
@NYJACL @amazon We need #Justice now! The impacts of the #TechIndustry are worsening  #gentrification and widening the #wealthgap.

@NYJACL @NYCComptroller Lack of internet access limits #economic opportunity for people. We need #internet service providers to make sure all the communities are being served #equally.
@NYJACL @NYCComptroller The #DigitalDivide impacts communities of color disproportionately. We advocate to increase internet access in vulnerable communities, esp in #redlined neighborhoods. 		#Internet access should be a human right in this #digital age! We need it for pretty much everything.
@NYJACL Thank you for uplifting this. Hashtag activism matters! 		We need to make sure issues impacting our community are trending and at the forefront. 		Our #online voices impact our lives offline!
@BruceMirken @VinhcentLe That‚Äôs the scary thing about #algorithms! There‚Äôs no transparency about this and it‚Äôs hard to know how. It‚Äôs kind of like #Bandersnach. 		That‚Äôs why we need transparency in how algorithms actually work. We recommend pushing for an algorithm #audit as one way to address this.

S/o to @ArtemisMedSoc for working with us on a report on women physicians of color last year: https://t.co/WBbK08PyCX
The medical field can and should serve as a role model for a broader movement toward equity throughout our economy. To accomplish this, we must start by listening to the voices of women physicians of color.
The entire medical field must address financial and structural barriers that now	create obstacles, including gender pay inequity and unfair maternity leave policies.
Medical schools and residency programs must also strengthen anti-discrimination and reporting policies, to assure that those who suffer discrimination will feel safe in reporting it, and that such reporting will actually make a difference.
Medical schools need to act aggressively to increase diversity in both student	admissions and faculty. The present severe lack of faculty diversity influences	decisions at medical schools across the country.
Health sector employers must increase their support for health career pipeline and training programs that recruit young people of color, especially young women of color.
The shortage of women of color among U.S. physicians means that millions of Americans of color lack access to culturally competent care from a provider with whom they feel comfortable.
#MinorityHealthMonth fact: Women of color are severely underrepresented among U.S. physicians, and they face serious barriers to entering medicine and succeeding in it.

When board diversity so badly fails to align with the labor force, companies can more easily make mistakes that alienate groups of customers and miss chances to make their corporate environments welcoming to diverse employees.
Corporate boards play a crucial role, from hiring and firing CEOs to setting corporate culture. The ‚Äòglass ceiling‚Äô or ‚Äògood old boys' club‚Äô -- still very much exists for women and people of color.
