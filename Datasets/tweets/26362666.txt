At this point, it really doesn't matter as Palestinians have no faith in America and no faith in the "peace process" which has been a fraud ever since Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated for "betraying the state".
And people who say "You can talk about this w/o dabbling in stereotypes", the problem is that criticism of Israel itself is seen as Antisemitic. You could try, but you'll be accused of rejecting its right to exist and therefore be called antisemitic anyhow.
It's tough and difficult to go against that b/c if you do, the "antisemitic" tag will be slapped on you.	You can't criticize Israeli Gov't actions against Palestinians b/c otherwise you'll be accused of being anti-Israel and antisemitic.
The fact is this:	AIPAC is a Political Action Committee that works to defend and support the Israeli Gov't in Washington.	As the Israeli Gov't has become more Right Wing and UltraNationalist over time, so too has AIPAC's policy pushes.
This is not a good look.	At all.	What Ilhan's said about AIPAC isn't wrong although she's probably dabbled in the "foreign allegiance" stereotype too much.	If we can't note AIPAC's use of Donations, how are we to criticize them? https://t.co/m5cdW3IXTS

Now, over 38 years later, the "Detroit's Wheels" brand re-emerges on the frequency that the original "Wheels" drove out of the Rock industry.	Radio can be funny like that...
The "Wheels" burnt rubber over the other Rockers in town, but none moreso than W4.	Come January '81, Shamrock Broadcasting decided to ride the "Urban Cowboy' move and flip W4 to Country.
You see, 106.7 was once WWWW-FM, aka W4, which was Detroit's pioneering Album Rocker when it launched in 1971.	In 1980, Doubleday bought religious 98.7 WBFG and in August that year flipped it to Rock-based CHR WLLZ as "98.7 Detroit's Wheels".
The "Wheels" spin again in Detroit.	And there's a whole lot of irony of it being resurrected on 106.7. https://t.co/KuU4EUY5I4

I admittedly wanted Biden to run in '16 b/c I wasn't truly on board with Hillary via those '08 scars.	When Joe dropped out, I gave Hillary a chance b/c I wanted nothing to do with Bernie.	Hillary won me over to the point I gladly cast my vote for her.
He worked with Jesse Helms to kill Integration to please Northern racists.	He cheerleaded the War on Drugs and wrote the Laws that led to Mass Incarcaration in America.	He threw Dr. Anita Hill under the bus for Clarence Thomas.	I don't care Barack made him VP, I'm #NeverBiden.
So Biden will indeed join because an old white man's ego must be fed.	For the record, I'm as strongly #NeverBiden as I am #NeverBernie.	I'll write-in Kamala and vote downballot if Joe's the nominee.	Other than Sherrod Brown, I'm done with Old White Men. https://t.co/392vzz9U2C

And hell, it even could be Brian May and Roger Taylor's vanity project which exposes their deep seeded jealousy for Freddie Mercury and was Directed by a man who turned out to be a creep.	You want me to get excited for one of those 3 films? Gimmie a break!
For Best Pic: It's "Green Book"-a film that Dr. Don Shirley's family has bashed and is a movie about a black figure made by an all-white production corps-vs "Roma"-a black-and-white subtitled film Directed by a man who cut a PSA for Autism Speaks.
"Are you ready?"	For an #Oscars where either a whitewashed film made to prevent Spike Lee &amp; Black Panther from winning or film by someone who believes Autism is a illness akin to cancer will win Best Pic?	NOPE!

@KAMALAMODE Absolutely, he needs to make a call quickly too.
Biden needs to stop making phone calls and either declare with an exploratory committee or say he ain't running.	Others are out in the field and doing work, Joe is letting them and that's not a smart move.
However, I think Biden taking his sweet time here is a miscalculation.	Other candidates are staffing up and aggressively courting endorsements.	Biden SHOULD be doing a Sherrod Brown-style listening tour right now getting views from potential voters instead of donors &amp; friends.
I can understand Beto taking his time because he actually has 2 options to choose from in the 2020 cycle.	He could go Presidential or Senatorial, and both are going to be pretty hard campaigns with no real guarantee of success.

Now, of course, FDR and his "New Deal" racially excluded Black People.	But the fact was that once the Black electorate no longer was attached to the GOP, there was no turning back.	Dems were aggressive in courting the Black vote and that was it...
THAT was the point Black Americans broke from GOP, and FDR was the first Democratic Pres. to court the Black electorate.	When he did that, it was the beginning of the end.	25 years later, the GOP embraced the Dixiecrats and the party officially stopped being the Party of Lincoln.
If that happened, it'd make Black People landowners. It's where the "40 Acres and a Mule" line came about and it got Black people at the time excited and eager to back Hoover.	When he became President, guess what happened? Hoover never even approached the idea.
When Hoover ran for Pres., to head off the potential scandal, he promised a fake commission to "investigate" the abuses, but more importantly promised Blacks he'd break up large plantations into small farms &amp; allow sharecropping Flood victims the opportunity to be farm owners.
It's 1927, and the Mississippi River and its tributaries flooded causing massive devastation and death.	Hebert Hoover became Sec. of Commerce and oversaw the effort to combat the flooding while at the same time imposing virtual slavery on blacks in refugee camps.
People like to think African-Americans flipping from R to D happened in the 60s, but you'd be wrong.	Rs were actually still openly courting them until the 60s.	It was the '30s that the flip began.
@reesetheone1 Carter fell apart b/c of '79/'80.	If you take out those two years, Carter isn't that bad of a President.
RT @VoteNewDems: Economic prosperity strongest under Clinton and Obama according to the data. Not a coincidence. Both perused pro-growth, #‚Ä¶
@reesetheone1 In fact, we know the specific reason why the flip happened.	It was because Hebert Hoover promised Blacks he'd break up large plantations into small farms and allow sharecroppers to become owners of said farms.	After becoming President, he broke those promises.	That was it!

@mrscorie @fawfulfan Me too.	Mostly b/c Senate bid would have stronger downballot effects in terms of House, State, and Local races than a Presidential bid IMO.
It's a choice that no other in the field has.	He has a ton of support right now that he could go either way.	The problem is that he doesn't triumph in any scenario.	It's all about what bid gives him the max, I'd say a Sen bid will do that.
If Beto gets in with the DSCC endorsement, the field will clear.	For Beto, the question right now is this: What option does he think will deliver the maximum result for him?	Presidential bid or Senate bid?	The choice is, ultimately, his. https://t.co/8i8nsiYm8x
@BarackDaVote Beto MAY have had Presidential feelings, but I think see the mood of the National electorate and he doesn't fit in it.
@BarackDaVote I think, at this point, Beto isn't going to triumph either way although it'll be a better move to face-off with Cornyn than Trump. 	Main goal is to continue to close the gap &amp; to get the maximum result politically.	Beto running for Senate achieves that, running for POTUS doesn't.
There's a shitton of Dem energy right now.	The goal is to how best feed off it and the best ballot construction.	Electric POTUS candidate + Electric Senate candidate = Max Energy consumption.
For Texas and other Red states, it's all about continuing to close the gap and build things up.	If the goal is to get Texas Purple by 2030, Beto running for Senate is the better play than Beto running for President.
A strong Dem Presidential candidate up top followed by an electric Senate candidate is the way you can help ensure the House majority is protected (and maybe expanded?) AND also help in state races as well.	And in Arizona and Georgia, it could put them in position to flip Blue.
How would Beto running for Senate EVEN in a losing effort be the smarter play?	He'll chip away further at the gap between Rs and Ds ESPECIALLY in Dallas and Houston suburbs.	It'll also do wonders for the House side of things.
This is the MUCH SMARTER move.	Keep chipping away at it and win in the Senate. https://t.co/5hpSh7e0O0
