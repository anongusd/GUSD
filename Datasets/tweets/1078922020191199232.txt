Abena McAllister: We were told by CNN that she is just an ‚Äúactive Democrat‚Äù. However, this is much less of a description compared to finding out she is actually the Charles County Democratic Central Committee‚Äôs Chair according to her being described by the committee.

A copy of Merkley‚Äôs full Blueprint for Our ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù Democracy can be found here: https://t.co/BGlatY1RjF
- Ensuring Equal Representation:	Abolish the Electoral College and elect Presidents by a national popular vote.		- Provide a pathway for voting representation in Congress for American citizens in D.C., Puerto Rico, and the territories.
- Require all states to allow early voting for at least two weeks before Election Day.		- Stop voter list purges. #Crosscheck		- Restore voting rights for those who served time for felony offenses.		- Nationwide automatic voter registration and same-day registration.
Protecting and Expanding the Rights of Voters:		- Reinstate the Voting Rights Act.		- Ensure equal access to polling locations and provisions to prevent long lines to vote.		- Institute national vote-by-mail.	Enhance election security.
Eliminating Gerrymandering:		- End partisan gerrymandering by requiring independent redistricting commissions to draw lines for all congressional districts, based on clear criteria to ensure representatives are responsive to their constituents.
-Give public citizens legal standing to sue corporations if the FEC fails to enforce election laws.		-Promote small donor engagement in elections.
Ending Dark Money:	- Pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United.	Ensure transparency in political donations.		-Give shareholders a voice in corporate political spending.
Merkley‚Äôs blueprint proposes passage of existing legislation‚Äîsuch as the DISCLOSE Act and the Voting Rights Advancement Act‚Äîand also proposes new bills to fill the gaps necessary to restore our democracy, which Merkley will introduce in the 116th Congress.
‚ÄúRight now, the privileged and powerful are running the show. It‚Äôs time to make sure every American has a truly equal voice in the direction of our nation, and that we have a government that responds to the hopes and needs of working Americans.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòWe the People‚Äô vision of our Constitution is being corrupted by dark, anti-democratic forces,‚Äù said Merkley. ‚ÄúWe need to restore our democracy.‚Äú
Oregon‚Äôs Senator Jeff Merkley today unveiled a sweeping blueprint to restore American democracy, outlining a series of proposals to take on voter suppression, gerrymandering, dark money, and unequal representation in our democracy.

@ColorfulAsylum1 One right now which means they will not vote for either
I would like to point out the dogwhistling @Liz_Cheney enacted with her #BuildTheWall comment. I bet Mary Cheney wouldn‚Äôt mind building one around her house.
So what‚Äôs happening now is the house is voting on Speaker of the House. @RepJeffries nominated @NancyPelosi on the Democratic side and @Liz_Cheney nominated @KevinMcCartyCA on the Republican side.

@VictorLicata1 @bobbiellen @AlbieBoyWonder @kanyewest Can confirm.

@DoctorCiocio @Buoy_Spinner @_ReaalAmerican_ Thanks. All I have is self promotion and I self funded most of that assignment myself.
@EarthmanJames @code_name_v @jordanbpeterson @DonaldJTrumpJr @BreitbartNews I‚Äôm not to keen on the Christian part and while I don‚Äôt agree with any political ideology 100 percent of the time I try not smite someone just for their beliefs. That‚Äôs just me though.

@Hope_Resists @lister_lester I just talked to a fellow American whose mother used to work there and there is a concern for pensions. It‚Äôs a bad deal for everyone but worse for those who lost it all.
@ColorfulAsylum1 @mentalobstacle Sounds about right
@AvatarBizarre Darn. I wish the best for your mom.
@AvatarBizarre I agree. They have transformers that they know are faulty and they refuse to do anything about it.
@Hope_Resists @lister_lester Sad isn‚Äôt it. They even have some old timey murder on their hands related to framing a person for a bombing üí£
@grmommaTam522 He is most certainly the worst of what we represent for the last 70 years. It‚Äôs sickening to think what it will take to clean up his mess.
@grmommaTam522 It‚Äôs all about ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs in it for me?‚Äù This is what the meeting between black community leadership and the White House was about : he was buying support. Thankfully there are a ton of people that are smarter than that.

@lpprdlvr @CollinsDesta I‚Äôm not sure if you know this but he‚Äôs kind of an idiot. What scumbag gets away with the biggest tax fraud in human history and then decides he will take a job that scrutinizes HIS WHOLE LIFE. And then CONTINUES TO GIVE THE FINGER TO EVERYONE WHO HATES HIM.

@BlueTsuni Correct üíØ. Now things have changed in the US but not all around the world. How do we approach this?
@RobertJMorriso9 Well yes Bob, üòÇ, that is true as well. If we were to have 4.3 million years left some say men would be extinct and women would be asexual. 		My thoughts are we will be lucky to survive the next 100 if all the science is correct.
@Nick_C_C 10 percent of the country is migrants and they are having 25 percent of new births. 		I‚Äôm for a better evolution all the way around. That means molding with ALL the amazing traits humanity has to offer. If that means more DNA outside of the my Neanderthal bloodline, I‚Äôm cool üòé
@dawsonfmuniv @jordanbpeterson @DonaldJTrumpJr It‚Äôs tough for me because I listen to him with @joerogan and he‚Äôs great. I listen to some of his YouTube stuff and he doesn‚Äôt seem that way and yet just like Joe‚Äôs fans, I find his fans very Right Wing Toxic. He also hangs with a concerning bunch. It‚Äôs such a conundrum.

..specifics but I think it‚Äôs very dangerous to use the words ‚ÄúBad choices‚Äù when we discuss female pregnancies, unwanted or not. Let me know what you think ü§î? I know this is an ‚ÄúEmotionally Charged‚Äù subject and I am fully aware of my status as a European male descendent. Thanks.
...ills for lack of a better word. We have a HUGE Re education of male society to deal with that constitutes men being more accountable to and for men. Those are not ‚Äúchoices‚Äù in my book. Now we can go back and forth about what lead to what and with each instance we can discuss..
....buy all this stuff. But hey those are choices and most of those choices can be worked with education. 		What are not ‚ÄúBad choices‚Äù are women who historically have to deal with more sexual harassment, rape, forced marriage to older men, pedophilia and many more of humanities..
...still having 25% of the new births in this country. The United States has a huge overconsumption problem that needs to be discussed but also has nothing to do with the poor. When you judge your countries strength on GDP you will always be producing too much. Someone has to...
Women have had to have more children historically because babies were dying at a much younger age, some as old as infant. In order to beat the odds you had to produce more. We have medical üè• advances that make that less likely and yet the less educated in our society are ....
...to read the book Drawdown I believe it‚Äôs number 6 that states that in order to save the human species from extinction we need to educate women more. I believe that üíØ as well as the men. Sexually active at the age of 14 and I didn‚Äôt know who I was personally till much older.
He lost me when discussing the #Abortion issue in that he said something to the effect that by the time the left and the right were in talks about women‚Äôs choice there had ‚Äúalready been a bunch wrong decisions being made.‚Äù Now I know what he means by the this and if you were....
So the conversation may have changed after as I haven‚Äôt seen the full clip. Also Jordan understands his audience so he may have been placating to them backstage when he used this verbiage. I am in no way trying to make his social media life more hell so please keep it respectful.
First of all, I believe it‚Äôs a Womens right to choose. Her body her choice. Men should be invited to table to give their input. At the end of the day women have the last say. They have the Veto power. Where he lost me is his choice of wording. And understand this was back stage.
Now follow me here: He is right and wrong when he discussed this and I do applaud him for at least starting a much needed conversation. This is not an attack on anyone per say. More of a conversation starter. First of all: I believe in a women‚Äôs right to choose.
Thread: I‚Äôm conflicted: @jordanbpeterson says a lot of great things. I believe in most of his message when I listen to him. He was speaking to @DonaldJTrumpJr and two other people backstage for @BreitbartNews the other day and I caught the clip.
