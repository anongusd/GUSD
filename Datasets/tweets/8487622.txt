Like a curtain, the fog lifted. "Very slowly, the lady appeared." Susan said she still gets goose bumps remembering her first sight of the Statute of Liberty. Seeing it, she knew they were free. In New York, Susan and Joseph are reunited with their family.
They went by train over the Pyrenees Mountains to Spain and sailed to Lisbon, Portugal. With about 50 other children they sail on the SS Serpa Pinto. This is Susi's tag that she wore on the voyage. As they arrive in New York Harbor, there is a heavy fog and they can't see. https://t.co/PfUuCz9L4g
After many months with no word from her parents, Susi is called to the office of the children's home where she and Joseph moved after Versailles. She was told "Your parents have been looking for you all over." They are in America and want Susi and her brother to join them.
Susi was summoned. "I was really very frightened," she said. After translating the conversation the officer asked "Little girl, how come you know how to speak German so good? I (thought) 'My God if he only knew I was Jewish.' "
The German army came to Versailles. "We heard the marching, the boots. It was very loud." A German officer wanted to speak to the mayor of Versailles but knew no French. Someone said: "There's a little girl up in the palace. She knows how to speak German. "
Susan and Joseph were not safe for long in Paris. The Nazis invaded, and the children escaped with other Parisians. They stayed a night in the magnificent Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles, sleeping on burlap bags filled with hay. https://t.co/cz4aM3WWfp
Susan's parents gave their life savings to smugglers who took Susi and Joseph to France. The baby stayed with her parents. "Can you imagine what it was like to send your children away and maybe never see them again?" https://t.co/ImB0ZIzvaJ
Susan's father was arrested on Kristallnacht but later released. The rest of the family hid for days in the attic. After that night, Susan's parents knew they could not keep their children safe. https://t.co/ZEurOVMDIT
Also that night, called Kristallnacht, her neighbors pulled down a telephone pole and rammed it through the front door. Susan remembers the blue, green and purple glass from the decorative door, shattered on the floor.
One evening in 1938, Susi and her brother were asleep in their bedroom. Rocks started coming through the window. She cowered under her blankets, but her brother, Joe, ran to the window. He said: "It is our neighbors that are throwing the bricks and the rocks through the window." https://t.co/nwANCwkE3H
When Susi was a young girl, new laws prohibited Jews from using many parks, including one in her neighborhood. She went into the park anyway and the gatekeeper began throwing bricks at her.
Here (far right) is Susan Warsinger with her family. They lived in Bad Kreuznach, Germany. In first grade, her teacher read an antisemitic book, "The Poisonous Mushroom," which depicted Jews as poisonous.  The children knew Susan was Jewish.

Ralph Berets closed his First Person program: "If you understand what happened and how it happened and if you understand you can do something about it, you only need to help one person. And that person can help one person. And if it‚Äôs a stranger, that‚Äôs even better." https://t.co/qLmRPd579m
Ralph‚Äôs parents came to America. He went to six different schools the first year because they didn‚Äôt have a permanent place to live. Later Ralph began to feel like an American. ‚ÄúI dressed like an American. I got a crew cut.‚Äù  He played baseball in high school.
After the war, Ralph's parents felt truly liberated.  "My sister and I felt abandoned. After the war, we barely saw them. They were out with friends; they were out rebuilding their lives."
Canadian soldiers liberated the farm and came to the chicken coop. They brought Hershey‚Äôs chocolate and gum. ‚ÄúI thought chocolate was the greatest thing in the world,‚Äù Ralph said. He‚Äôd never had gum and swallowed it.
Ralph‚Äôs family moved to a chicken coop on the property of a farmer. At one time, 14 people crammed inside. ‚ÄúSix people got to sleep and then six more people got to sleep,‚Äù Ralph said. They ate the food scraps the farmer meant to feed the pigs. Ralph and his sister got very sick.
Ralph and his sister were later placed with another family for safety. Their mother visited at times. Once, the Germans came. Ralph, his sister and mother hid in the rafters. The Germans heard a noise and began looking. They found a cat and thought it was the source of the noise. https://t.co/c9FiMqJOOE
The next day, Ralph‚Äôs family went to thank the farmer. They found one of the farmer‚Äôs son hanging from a meat hook in a barn. The farmer discovered his son had reported Ralph‚Äôs family, so he and two other sons killed him.
Ralph was then not yet four years old. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my first real memory,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI remember the storm, how noisy it was, how wet I got. I remember the Germans screaming and yelling.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere was a terrible storm with thunder and lightning and the Germans couldn‚Äôt find us,‚Äù Ralph remembers. So they burned down the cottage.
Ralph‚Äôs family moved to a cottage on the land of a Christian farmer. One day, after 10 months in the cottage, one of the farmer‚Äôs sons came running and screaming: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to get out. You‚Äôve got to get out. The Germans are coming.‚Äù Ralph‚Äôs family ran and hid in a nearby ditch. https://t.co/Sj1aeZMaqF
Ralph was born in 1939, five months before the Germans invaded the Netherlands. His parents began collecting food and putting it away in a cottage in case they had to go into hiding. They got false papers and new identities.
In Germany, Ralph‚Äôs father was falsely accused of rape and his storefront was covered with swastikas. He realized he had to leave Germany. The family tried to come to America, but couldn‚Äôt get visas. So they moved to the Netherlands. https://t.co/RFo1OnIkrR

@LiNKTexas From Erbelding: Humanitarian organizations were the loudest voices during the Holocaust, and still the loudest voices against atrocities now.
@LiNKTexas Thank you for the question. Dallek answers: I'm not convinced we're seen the end of horrors and atrocities, they seem to take place every day. What's so important is that people remember history‚Äîto keep people asking why.
@lizzymcbooboo29 Thank you for the question! Has the discussion addressed it?
Dallek: Can anybody think of another first lady who had her chutzpah and influence on the international scene? She was later our first ambassador to the United Nations.
Audience question: Why do you think Eleanor Roosevelt was the greatest first lady of all time? Why and who else vies for that title?
Our perspective has changed with the use of the atomic bomb, with the Holocaust‚Äînow the question is, how could they get away with this? Using their industrial strength to slaughter people?‚ÄîDallek
@stevenbaumann Thanks for your question. Has the discussion answered it?
What is the role of military intervention in a humanitarian crisis?‚ÄîErbelding
Proposal to bomb Auschwitz never reaches FDR‚Äôs desk. ... We struggle with this question because we want so much that there would be something the US could have done.‚ÄîErbelding
Please post your questions for Robert Dallek at #AskWhy.
These reports of systematic annihilation were in '43 just after invasion of N Africa. American troops were thousands of miles away. They issued a statement ... couldn't think of anything that could be done.‚ÄîErbelding
Dallek: As early as ‚Äò43 he had reports of systematic annihilation. He did say some things in public about war criminals and that there would be a reckoning with these people after the war. ... They were volatile times and they were sensitive about alienating the American public.
Audience question: When did #FDR have information that mass murders were occurring and did he not do anything about it because he wanted to avoid the impression the war was to help the Jews?
American propaganda recognized the war as a fight for democracy.‚ÄîErbelding
He avoided the impression of favoring any particular religious camp.‚ÄîDallek
The last thing #FDR wanted people in the US to assume is that we were going to war to rescue the Jews. ‚Ä¶ Pearl Harbor was a godsend.‚ÄîDallek
#FDR will never live down the moral failing, in a sense, of not being outspoken about the Holocaust. ‚Ä¶ This will haunt his reputation.‚ÄîDallek
I‚Äôm 83 years old and I wanted to get done with the book.‚ÄîDallek
#FDR lives for the vast majority of your book. Did you know from the beginning that you would end with his death a page and a half before the end?‚ÄîErbelding
His attitude was that so many millions of people had perished in this conflict, this was his sacrifice.‚ÄîDallek
He would lie on the floor, writhing from angina attacks. Congestive heart failure. When he ran for that fourth term, there was no question he was dying‚Ä¶. If the war was over, I don‚Äôt think #FDR would have run again.‚ÄîDallek
You argue in the book that #FDR‚Äôs was far sicker for far longer than historians have realized. How did that manifest in his presidency?‚ÄîErbdeling
Hitler was obsessed with keeping up the killing, despite Nazi losses. It is incredible to think about how this nation descended into barbarism. ... The Museum reminds us that we must never forget.‚ÄîDallek
It didn't matter, because Stalin had spies in the Manhattan Project and already knew.‚ÄîDallek
#FDR played up idealism but was a realist. Talked about our great Soviet allies, but hid from Stalin the creation of the atomic bomb.‚ÄîDallek
But he was always very cautious...not to move ahead of political consensus.‚ÄîDallek
Privately, he was more interested in helping. Invoked the Neutrality Act when Italy invaded Ethiopia ‚Ä¶ to punish Italy for its aggression.‚ÄîDallek
#FDR believe you need a stable political commitment if you‚Äôre going to expend blood and treasure. He wouldn‚Äôt boldly run counter to public opinion.‚ÄîDallek
Could you talk about how #FDR moved an isolationist nation to war?‚ÄîErbelding
Even a push to bring in refugee children doesn‚Äôt make it out of committee because people say these children are going to grow up and need jobs.‚ÄîErbelding
And antisemitism was widespread at the time.‚ÄîDallek
People thought that when troops came home from the war it would create a surge in unemployment. They were worried country would fall into another depression. Didn‚Äôt want to take in people who would need to live off a public dole.‚ÄîDallek
Waiting lists to immigrate to US. #FDR didn‚Äôt push to increase quotas, but let people who were here to stay. What political constraints did he face?‚ÄîErbelding https://t.co/UTft8A9luz
He said privately after Kristallnacht, this man Hitler is a maniac.‚ÄîDallek
#FDR at the end of the day was a careful politician. ‚Ä¶ He didn‚Äôt want to have a public face about immigration, rescue of the Jews. Eleanor came to him privately to ask for his intervention to let in a group of Jews ‚Ä¶ pushed him to speak out, and he didn‚Äôt.‚ÄîDallek
FDR‚Äôs ambassador to Germany, Dodd, would write to Roosevelt about the threats of Nazism. State Department wanted Dodd out, but Roosevelt kept him, took him seriously.‚ÄîDallek
Turning to Americans and the Nazi threat. He and Hitler are interesting contemporaries. They came to power in 1933, both faced economic insecurity. When did #FDR start to see Nazism as a threat?‚ÄîErbelding https://t.co/Z2D8xi4Amv
#FDR was never an open, public advocate of the advancement of African Americans. He wouldn‚Äôt support an anti-lynching bill. ‚Ä¶ But by the end of his presidency, black voters had moved from the Republican party to the Democratic party.‚ÄîDallek
#FDR‚Äôs mother told him not to get divorced because divorced people couldn‚Äôt rise in public office. They came to an agreement. They had public lives. They‚Äôre private lives didn‚Äôt animate them. ‚ÄîDallek
One of the very important people in FDR‚Äôs life was Eleanor. They had an interesting relationship. Can you talk about that?‚ÄîErbelding
#FDR was very difficult to read and that was on purpose on his part.‚ÄîDallek
There are no surviving photographs of #FDR‚Äôs disability. Off-camera, he would have to be carried, for example onto ships.‚ÄîDallek
#FDR had an extraordinary relationship with the press. He would hold two press conferences a week. Would conduct off-the-record conversations.‚ÄîDallek
#FDR uses this self-confidence in his relationship to the press. Can you speak about that?‚ÄîErbelding
He was a patrician who came to the  presidency with the sense that he deserved to be there ‚Ä¶ but we cannot forget his debilitating polio attack, which served to humanize him. ‚Ä¶ He wanted to overcome that disability.‚ÄîDallek
How did #FDR change over the course of his life?‚ÄîErbelding
The country has gone through difficulties and we have managed to surmount them.‚ÄîDallek
Young people have lost track of the events of the 1930s. ‚Ä¶ I aimed this book at young people. ‚ÄîDr. Robert Dallek
#FDR looms large in the story of what Americans knew about Nazi persecution and how they responded.‚ÄîDr. Rebecca Erbelding.

Visit our website to learn about upcoming #USHMM events here in DC and in your community. #AskWhy #USHMM https://t.co/BCusym2UUh
The lecture is now over. Dr. Wachsmann will take questions from audience. We will post video of this lecture later. #AskWhy #USHMM
Readers must be left to imagine the camps themselves with help of voices of those who were there. #AskWhy #USHMM
To speak about the camps, we must appeal to the mind but also the senses. Must be careful not to force emotions onto readers. #AskWhy #USHMM
The first to struggle with the limits of language were the survivors themselves. #AskWhy #USHMM
How often can we use words "unbearable" and "heartbreaking" before they lose their power? #AskWhy #USHMM
In conclusion, Wachsmann turns to one final question: How do we write about this? What tone? What language? #AskWhy #USHMM
Even when memories of events align, the meanings of the events can be elusive. #AskWhy #USHMM
Witnesses own beliefs and passage of time can shape memories of events. #AskWhy #USHMM
Individual memories sometimes superimposed with collective ones, &amp; witnesses sometimes describe same event differently. #AskWhy #USHMM
Memory poses additional challenges. Survivor testimonies essential, but subject to source criticism. #AskWhy #USHMM
However, even when we can reconstruct a former prisoner's path, many blanks remain. Didn't or couldn't share some experiences. #AskWhy
Some of these gaps will remain, but others will be filled with determination and luck. #AskWhy #USHMM
Few records form German "social outsiders." #AskWhy #USHMM
Others survived but had no voice after the war. Few records from surviving Soviet POWs who were suspected of being traitors. #AskWhy #USHMM
Some could never leave behind a record of their experiences--those who were murdered or died after arrival. #AskWhy #USHMM
In his own book, Wachsmann only covered some prisoners. Cannot cover entire prisoner experience. #AskWhy #USHMM
Even a representative sample (education, nationality, etc.) cannot cover entire range of experience. #AskWhy #USHMM
Material from postwar period raises new questions: Which testimonies should historians consult? #AskWhy #USHMM
Thousands of written testimonies given in 1945 and 1946 alone. Many more given later. #AskWhy #USHMM
Individuals might have remained silence, but there was no collective silence. #AskWhy #USHMM
To fill the gaps, we have to look at postwar survivor testimony. #AskWhy #USHMM
Sources like these valuable but rare. Once victims disappeared into the camps, their voices disappeared with them. #AskWhy #USHMM
Some of these writings are still being discovered and read now. #AskWhy #USHMM
Jews who worked in Sonderkommando in Birkenau who ran crematoria recorded &amp; buried their experiences. #AskWhy #USHMM
Others sent secret letters to the outside, including to family members. #AskWhy #USHMM
Still, some prisoners tried. Some more privileged prisoners kept diaries (eg. Edgar Kupfer). #AskWhy #USHMM
These sources are crucial but also extremely rare. Camp conditions made writing in secret almost impossible. #AskWhy #USHMM
Victims who wrote without knowledge of what would become of them or the regime recorded experiences in the moment. #AskWhy#USHMM
Wachsmann turns to the role of prisoners in recording their own fate. #AskWhy #USHMM
We would know even less about SS policies if not for prisoners who took administrative positions and copied/hid documents. #AskWhy #USHMM
RT @jgpetruna: @HolocaustMuseum a) "Ordinary Men" is very hard to read.		b) Everyone should read "Ordinary Men" (also "The Good Old Days").
RT @PWGrasmehr: @HolocaustMuseum @BirkbeckHCA @YouTube Excellent references! In my job @pritzkerlibrary I use my copies to answer public in‚Ä¶
Documents were often misleading. In addition, key orders never written. Transmitted in meetings and by telephone calls. #AskWhy #USHMM
Evidence that remains is fragmented and scattered. #AskWhy #USHMM
The SS left a gigantic paper trail, but as the war ended, SS officials destroyed much of this as war ended. #AskWhy #USHMM
Each camp had an "elaborate bureaucracy of repression." There was order behind the terror. #AskWhy #USHMM
In popular memory, camps associated with extreme violence. But this obscures everyday operation of terror. #AskWhy #USHMM
Ideological obsessions also played a role. #AskWhy #USHMM
Since publication of Christopher Browning's Ordinary Men, historians have used social psychology to understand them. #AskWhy #USHMM
Documents written by perpetrators helps to understand their behavior &amp; complicate view of perpetrators. #AskWhy #USHMM
However, information can be gleaned from their writings as well as those of more junior members of the SS. #AskWhy #USHMM
Other defendants denied most basic truths, eg. gassings at Auschwitz. #AskWhy #USHMM
Right until his execution, Pohl insisted that he had only been a professional soldier and had done nothing wrong. #AskWhy #USHMM
Few high-ranking perpetrators in camp system gave testimony after war. Most senior was Oswald Pohl, but he was unreliable. #AskWhy #USHMM
Cannot understand camp system without perpetrator documents and perpetrator testimony. #AskWhy #USHMM
Tonight's lecture focuses on perpetrators and victims. #AskWhy #USHMM
Third decision: Tell the history from multiple perspective: Perpetrators, prisoners, and "onlookers." #AskWhy #USHMM
Faced very hard decision to leave out stories that he had read but couldn't fit into the narrative. #AskWhy #USHMM
Chose to cover the entire period of the Third Reich, from 1933 to 1945. How to keep the study from becoming to big? #AskWhy #USHMM
Chose to write about how system evolved and how life and death in the camps changed. This created the next problem: #AskWhy #USHMM
Not possible to cover every single camp in detail. Two-dozen main camps, 1,100+ satellite camps. #AskWhy #USHMM
Could not include all camps, though. Chose to focus on SS Camp System under Himmler. Other sites (ghettos, death camps, etc.) left out.
Wachsmann made three decisions about scope &amp; about scale: 1) Wanted to write a history of campy system as a whole. #AskWhy #USHMM
What are the practical problems facing historians writing about the Holocaust and the camps? #AskWhy #USHMM
This research is not uniquely difficult.  Wachsmann is not the first historian of the Holocaust to address this question. #AskWhy #USHMM
He wants to show where the limits are to what historians can do. #AskWhy #USHMM
Wachsmann will explain how he went about writing his book KL: A History of the Nazi Concentration Camps. #AskWhy #USHMM
Historians must write about the camps, but there no clear way to write about crimes that "defeat language and defy reason." #AskWhy #USHMM
Historians have wrestled with question of representation ever since liberation of Auschwitz and other camps. #AskWhy #USHMM
life in Auschwitz to those who had not been there.
Wachsmann begins with an anecdote about women who were prisoners at Auschwitz in 1944 who were trying to decide how to explain . . .
