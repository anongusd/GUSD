@cocoaudie @GOP While tearing up the Constitution? That would be treasonous.
@NSWUfrogman @vdavids @RepAdamSchiff They do when it's a matter of national security, which it is. 		Don't you want to know how much money Trump has laundered for Russian oligarchs, &amp; how much of his debt they own?		Or how badly he still wants to build Trump Tower Moscow? Badly enough to sell out America?
@RepAdamSchiff @realDonaldTrump's conflicts of interest know no boundaries. 		Compromised is the polite term.
@GOP Or we could talk about republicans restoring pre-existing conditions &amp; insurance caps.	Not to mention the return of medical bankruptcy.
@GOP If you want to talk about taking away health care, let's talk about the @GOP taking health care away from the most vulnerable women with an unconstitutional Bill of Attainder punishing Planned Parenthood, and their clients, without cover of due process. 	#TheResistance
@IlhanMN I've long been shocked at the Israeli war &amp; civil rights crimes that repubs are willing to ignore/support, knowing that they're committed by secular Israel &amp; not Judaism. 		It's a perverted view of anti-Semitism, which is consistent with their perverted view of religious liberty.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Empty words from a world-class demagogue. 		America has never seen a cult-of-personality as large and strong as #Cult45 	Enough with the echo chamber BS, @GOP		#TheResistance
@Morris_Pacific @lauferlaw @FOR_PETEYS_SAKE @MollyJongFast Ask, and I shall attempt to explain. üôÇü§îüñí	We're all in this together.
@MollyJongFast All the religious fanatics gravitate towards the @GOP . Or ISIS. 	Extremism is bad, no matter the label.
@lauferlaw @FOR_PETEYS_SAKE @MollyJongFast Dominionism got a boost after Roe v Wade, when republicans were looking for new ways to game elections. Bringing unscientific, undemocratic religion into the democratic process was their first volley in their war on democracy.	It also brought politics into religion. Bad combo.
@GeorgeTakei From the moments I peered in on CPAC, it seemed more than a little like a Bund meeting. The extremism was flowing freely. 		Can we start coming up with alternative meanings for CPAC?	Crazy Punk-Ass Conservatives, for example. 	Creepy Pseudo American Confederacy?
@realDonaldTrump Who releases manuscripts? 	I smell some pretty strong üêÇüí©,  and it's coming from your direction. 		Or should I say, *at* your direction?
@SandyBottom11 @tucuwe @Alyssa_Milano Sure you do.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump 1) Trick question. #Trump has no such policy. That policy *goal* belongs to his nannies.		Kim would no more give up his nukes than Trump would give up his wall or his tax returns.
@gina3743 @4everNeverTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You're referring to the wrong meeting.		Trump came out of the meeting with no NEW accomplishments. At least he didn't give away anything more than military readiness.
@mwhatsnext @tucuwe @Alyssa_Milano 3rd term abortions are very rare &amp; done for medical reasons. Should we have politicians with no stake in medical outcomes practice medicine without a license, to the detriment of those directly involved?		(I draw the line at viability for elective abortions, as does Roe v Wade.)
@tucuwe @Alyssa_Milano Are you suggesting that the lies of the extreme right be legitimized? 	They will certainly never examine facts &amp; views that challenge their own, or there would be no hostile controversy.
@CarolMillerWV is also drowning in the kool-aid. 	OMG! 		#CohenTestimony

Will @MarkMeadows be as hard on the members of Trump's inner circle who lied/left out contacts on their security forms?		#CohenTestimony
The "gentleman" asked a loaded question. Considering that Cohen is testifying voluntarily, no answer seems appropriate for a biased question. 		#CohenTestimony
Just out of curiosity, did anyone notice if a republican asked a question that was not an attack on the witness? 		Do they think that abetting a cover-up gives them some moral high ground? 		#CohenTestimony

Mark Green only wants to hear from "honest" witnesses.		@realDonaldTrump doesn't hire or confide in honest people. I don't think there are any honest republicans left.		#CohenTestimony
Would this be a good time to remember that @Jim_Jordan lied about not knowing of sexual misconduct that happened on his watch?		#CohenTestimony
@Jim_Jordan complains about not following the rules, then yielded his time, then demanded an exception to the rules because he got overheated &amp; made a mistake. 		What a putz. 		#CohenTestimony

@language_arts @realDonaldTrump I think he has coastal resort property in mind. 		Not kidding.
@lisabinger3 @JaneenWFarmer @SpeakerPelosi The payments were not treason, they were campaign law violations. Corruption. Election fraud. 		You do not present yourself as someone familiar with the facts. You are what you accuse others of being. It's called projection.
@lisabinger3 @JaneenWFarmer @SpeakerPelosi By "call girl", do you mean the porn star, or the Playboy model? Neither of which took money for sex.		Treason would be along the lines of "aid &amp; comfort to the enemy, like ending sanctions prematurely or refusing to impose legally mandated additional sanctions.
@realDonaldTrump You're salivating at the possibility of personal profits from deals you might make in N. Korea. 		You can't help it, you're just an opportunistic hustler with no real compression of America's interests. 		Try not to give away the Korean peninsula.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @VP Has he already forgotten the dead silence he got last time he announced that he was representing #Trump ?	He has gravelly undermined our ability to lead on the world stage, and #Pence is proud of that? 		Nothing @VP says has meaning. He's Trump's right-hand gaslighter.
@Shortdo75823357 @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump When he ordered changing military policy toward serving LGBT, taking the Pentagon by surprise in spite of claiming he consulted with 'his generals'.		When he claimed a fake emergency so he could ignore Congress.		When he pulled out of the Paris deal &amp; the Iran agreement.	...
@ChrisepinkChris @GOP @PressSec @realDonaldTrump 1. He fell nearly 3 million votes short of a majority of voter support, it was the electoral college where he got a majority.		2. Until he discloses his communications with other leaders, he is literally going it alone.		3. He lies, in easily demonstrable ways, on a daily basis.
@realDonaldTrump Your deep insecurity is like a powerful gravity well, pulling your every thought back to protecting your public image no matter how far off point it drags you.		You are taking credit for things you signed for but don't understand. And you won't be around when the bill comes due.
@Jim_Jordan .@realDonaldTrump throws "Rule of Law" under the bus every time he rules by fiat, with the support of radical hardliners like you.		You have helped him throw honesty, honor, &amp; ethics out the window.
@GOP @PressSec Until @realDonaldTrump fully briefs our intelligence agencies &amp; Congress on his previous discussions w/our enemies, he's acting as a rogue agent - Air Force One notwithstanding.		He shouldn't be having further meetings with Kim, Putin,or anyone else. He doesn't represent America.
Least American @POTUS ever!		Save the Date, save the Constitution, save the Country, from the King of Fake emergencies, fake facts, and fake #MAGA https://t.co/HZrefoJH7R
@ChrisMurphyCT I was very surprised at the convoy of humanitarian aid. It is SO out of character for Trump. Which gives credibility to suspicions of ulterior motives.
@GobAbiertoBOL @realDonaldTrump No, it's not. But you know that already.		You might also note that unfettered capitalism doesn't work. Ever. Which is why it's not practiced anywhere. Properly regulated capitalism is the best &amp; most common system in the world.		Republicans are out to break that in the USA.
@realDonaldTrump As a Putin insider, can you (@realDonaldTrump) tell us if he (#Putin) plans to hold to his economic and military pacts with Venezuela? 		What am I saying? Trump doesn't disclose what he discuses with Putin, even when allegedly representing the United States.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump #ICYMI, Capitalism - when taken beyond its natural limitations - has the same result.		It's called Feudalism. The @GOP dream for America.		Also, Dems aren't talking about the type of socialism as republicans speak of. They're talking about the kind suggested in the Constitution.
@cuteniblett It's a start. Now identify how many of those bills represented actual progressive policy, and how many served other purposes. Are you including resolutions? How many were altered by amendment?
@MENA_Conflict @farrellbruce2 Doesn't. Matter. 	The problem is in perceptions. 		This wasn't the first weapon to get the bedazzle treatment, and it won't be the last. 		This gun is an example of a trend of blurring the visible difference b/t real &amp; toy weapons. Ditto for printed guns.
@amyzahnMSNBC @PrincessBravato @MSNBC @kendisgibson Do you mind if I assume that 2pm-4pm is for the eastern time zone? 		Not being in the ET, these little details make a difference.
@farrellbruce2 Even worse, it looks like a toy. 		1. It will not be commonly recognized as a real threat until fired.		2. Once it becomes a recognizably threat, all toy guns, no matter how obviously a toy, will be presumed to be a live weapon.		Shootings &amp; wrongful deaths ensue.	#MAGA /snark
@MobilityAgent @GOP @PressSec @realDonaldTrump By what measure is he the best?	Endless corruption?	Profuse liar? 	Consorting with our enemies while keeping those conversations secret from US intelligence? 	Betraying &amp; alienating our allies?	Attacking the press, the courts, &amp; political targets.	Encouraging division &amp; violence?
@SafetyPinDaily Doesn't that run counter to the principle behind sanctuary cities? 		All things considered, maybe they should start with investigating the priests.
@susansternberg @SchoofsFeed @PGourevitch @facebook @WSJ @samschech Thanks. You are correct. 		This is what threw me at first. https://t.co/8sspxhVGzR
@TolyNicole Tell me how #Trump can keep his one-on-one conversations with #Putin &amp; Kim Jong Un secret from even his own security advisors, as well as the US intelligence organizations, and not be considered a national security risk. He offers no proof that he works in the US interest.

@GOP @PressSec .@realDonaldTrump is so far off the rails as a "president" that he invites disrespect. At a Minimum. America won't survive with him in the White House. It's already well down the slippery slope.
@thecjpearson @SebGorka @RealCandaceO Your message is downright perverse. The @GOP actively opposes civil rights. 		Just check their legislative agenda, modern history, &amp; their lack of diversity. 		Though they are making a push to collect more non-white pawns like yourself.
@thehill Say pollinators instead of bees. The clueless &amp; the infantile will mock "bees" w/o understanding their importance in the food chain.		Or worse, they care more about attacking you than they care about survival.
@WhiteHouse With the White House pushing the country towards fascism, and the @GOP protecting and supporting it; and given that nobody is actually pushing for the socialism you speak of, you are probably correct - for once.
@TrickFreee @mccvic The legal construction philosophy of the Federalist Society also needs public review.		As far as I can tell so far, it's just a license to interpret the Constitution as desired.

@GaleTStrong From the state that retaliated against a unanimous state supreme court decision by trying to oust the entire court through political means. 		The rule of law is losing to religious extremism masked as religious liberty.
@peaceandlovelu @Makah758 @RBReich That depends on how effectively the @GOP can rig elections, the courts, &amp; public opinion in their favor.		In a judiciary hearing, ranking member Collins (R-GA) claimed that rigged elections can be unrigged through the election process.		How many RWNJs will take thatüí© as Gospel?
@PernillaLaila @thehill He called an emergency in an effort to build his wall before the 2020 election.		According to @realDonaldTrump himself. On the record. 		Mexico isn't going to pay for the wall, but he has got them abusing the refugees before they even get near our border.		3 moral v 1 immoral. ‚úî

@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Considering that you're re-tweeting far-right subversives, your understanding of the Constitution remains unproven &amp; uniquely absent.

So now they're starting to trickle in - and mill around like an after-service coffee hour. 		Seems backwards to me.

@kim89Da @greg_doucette I suspect that he used to be a good man, but his political hackery has gotten out of control.
@regan11218lane @RepJerryNadler has to be careful. If he cracks down too much, the republicans will take it as proof that Nadler has turned the hearing into a circus or he can't manage it or something. Collins will make sure that if Dems show strength, it'll look abusive.
@greg_doucette I don't know about his intelligence, but his credibility is plummeting.	#IMHO
@greg_doucette He was given considerable time to prepare for this, and it looks like he spent the time preparing to non-answer questions.		I find it particularly appalling that Whitaker tried to take control of the questioning.		It doesn't help that Doug Collins is out to poison this hearing.
@greg_doucette https://t.co/rJXAp3bHdH
Collins brought a big bag of monkey wrenches, and his arm is fully warmed up. 		This is like watching a 3-way cage march.

@riesquer @aabramson Arguments were made diminishing the importance of questioning (short-term) Whitaker instead of a confirmed AG.		Having a subpoena in the hopper could save 2+ weeks of haggling before finishing the questioning.
@aabramson @Jim_Jordan He refused to acknowledge that the Ds weren't going to issue the subpoena unless Whitaker wasn't cooperative. 		Jordan was a real attack dog, stuck in his partisan mindset.
@aabramson I watched a good portion of the hearing today. I missed the end, but what I saw was fascinating. The Ds want to authorize (but not issue). The Rs mostly deferred to @Jim_Jordan, who doggedly stuck to the idea that Whitaker would show up &amp; testify, &amp; Ds shouldn't issue a subpoena.

@plhuff1 @GOP The "damn Dems" finally have some authority to stop it.		It was the repubs that suspended the debt limit, maxed out the deficit they could add thru reconciliation, cut revenue to the bone. No fiscal responsibility.		Bankrupting the govt has been a core #GOP mission for decades.
@GOP The reviews are in: the @GOP has taken another step toward fascism. 		Did #Trump mention the National Debt in his #SOTU or his campaign promise to eliminate it in 10 years, or how he's on track to double it instead? No?		Deficit alone approaching 10% of GDP! #GOP fiscal suicide.

@OldDominionPost @ABC Registration is at the COUNTY level.	Registering via DMV is commonplace.	"Specific location" would only apply to same-day registration.

DHS Secretary didn't come off very well there.		At least you have all the right-wing talking points down, including the obligatory personal insults.	#tRumpShutdown
@D_B_Paralegal @Warwick31 @SteveScalise @FoxNews It's not so great if you don't speak Spanish, it would seem.		The Right has been tearing families apart, separating &amp; mistreating children. Some have even died in their hands. They are literally trafficking in children. 		The Left is trying to expose &amp; stop that. 	#TheResistance
@Kent_Vaughn @trishwalker163 @SteveScalise Building &amp; maintaining The Great Wall encompassed centuries, thousands of lives, &amp; multiple dynasties. It was built to stop hostile invaders, not refugees. 		It's actually a series of walls, with gaps. The invaders eventually just went around them.
@SteveScalise Do you have any credible sources for your assertions?	@FoxNews doesn't qualify as credible.
@FreedomWorks So-called "price controls" would be imposed on corporations, not Americans. Still-living Americans would benefit.
@FreedomWorks Affordability vs high cost monopolies? I'll take affordable. 		The Pharmaceutical industry is not subject to free-market forces to any meaningful degree. 	It's a matter of tilting toward patients or profiteers. 	Freedomworks sides with the predators of health care.
@MicheleNixNCGOP @NCGOP Define "duly-elected", and how it applies to an election based on such blatant procedural corruption.		I'll wait.

@realDonaldTrump @RT_Erdogan Erdogan is more interested in suppressing the Kurds, our allies in fighting ISIS in Syria, than in upping their game against ISIS.

@mkraju Naw, that's not tyranny. It's a sign of an emotionally crippled @POTUS, with no understanding of how to govern, being easily influenced by baskets of deplorables &amp; unfriendly foreign powers.		It also shows the dangerously unamerican merging of govt and privately owned press.
@RobMajor4 @politico I don't think that the possibility of a veto override would ever take up space in @SpeakerRyan's mind.		Just as @realDonaldTrump would never consider the negative consequences of tanking the stock market just before the world economic summit.	#ThursdayThoughts	#TheResistance
@realDonaldTrump You lack the empathy to understand anyone's feelings.		Nor do you have the military acumen of even an armchair general, let alone a true Commander in Chief.

@realDonaldTrump Translation: 	"I need to declare a victory to distract from my legal problems."		"I learned nothing from Iraq. I didn't even study."		"The damage won't be obvious until after I leave office."		"I can finally meet the troops in (fresh from) the field. Isn't that great of me?"
@Ragnar51498547 @ClaraSorrenti Securing from hostile forces, yes. 	Securing control over the locals as a matter of conquest is imperialism, not liberation.
@stofsk @annie_bear95 @Ragnar51498547 @ClaraSorrenti Hitler was Austrian, not German. What's your point?
@ClaraSorrenti Under Stalin, the Red Army slowed its advance on Germany to secure control of the countries they liberated from the Nazis, turning them into "satellite" countries.		Then fell the Iron Curtain &amp; the USSR was born.		Was Stalin anti-fascist, or simply opposed to the competition? ü§î
@RevJJackson @thinkprogress @SantitaJ That means they have no downside to killing innocent people. 		I'd call that a classic police state.

@mygrandmacanout @LindseyGrahamSC "acknowledges that a (singular) charge his sources made about a tech company CEO and Democratic Party hacking is unverified."	Unverified does not = disproven.	*A* charge does not cover the whole dossier.	You see what you want to see, and see it in sources with right-wing spin.
@mygrandmacanout @LindseyGrahamSC So, no citation. No supporting evidence. Typical RW BS. Dive into your rabbit hole without me.
@Gmt49Thomas @LindseyGrahamSC ...you added that on your own, assumed a different debate. Obstruction &amp; collusion are 2 different things.	It's no wonder you don't understand what I'm saying.

@mygrandmacanout @LindseyGrahamSC Where did you get that?
@mygrandmacanout @LindseyGrahamSC "Evidence" of a made-up dossier is indeed uncorroborated. 		Nothing in the Steele dossier has been disproven, and some have been proven accurate.
@LindseyGrahamSC Spoken like a committed co-conspirator.		I would like to get to the bottom of how a republican attacking the rule of law in defense of political corruption could hope to land on the judiciary committee. 		Our forefathers rebelled against people like you.
@LindseyGrahamSC Discussion? 		Will you also be defending your assertion that there was something wrong with the application of the FISA process? You could start with identifying a valid basis for your assertion.
@dcexaminer .@realDonaldTrump doesn't respect the significance of debt because he's always had someone to bail him out.

@ericgeller @EACgov I've seen too many republican voice votes to trust the outcome. For that matter, I've seen too many empty chamber unanimous consent votes by McConnell.

@senrobportman @GM Instead of rationalizing the republican tax law, why not consider why the layoffs &amp; closings?		Supply siders so often forget or ignore the other sides of the equation.		Consider that low gas prices encourage SUV sales over high efficiency models. People like their vroom.

@slimjimtuc @dante2_ @AP_Politics @realDonaldTrump @GOP Republicans have neutralized the Constitutionally defined checks on power by what James Madison described as "the very definition of tyranny" - Federalist 47	They're packing the courts with RW activists under the banner of "Constitutionalist", by violating the Constitution.
@slimjimtuc @dante2_ @AP_Politics @realDonaldTrump @GOP Republicans are aggressively sabotaging the democratic process via:	Voter roll manipulation 	Voting poll manipulation 	Tactical gerrymandering 	Clinging to unsecured voting equipment 	Giving a pass to foreign interference 	Voter disinformation 	Illegal voter purges 	And more

@jennybethm @thehill By withholding documents, blocking witnesses, and attacking all critical questioning, it was the Republicans who suppressed due process. They made a mockery of Advise and Consent by turning it into a rubber stamp.

.@JohnCornyn is on the Senate floor spinning all the @GOP talking points in a divisive appeal to emotion.		It's ridiculous to claim that only the Dems had made up their minds in advance.	Isn't there a Senate rule against questioning the motives of other members?
@tribelaw The conservatives are packing &amp; restructuring the courts to enforce their ideology, which why it's so dangerous to the Constitution.	They are politicizing the one branch of government that absolutely must be non-political.

@Silverwilllow @AngrierWHStaff @GOP When they gerrymandered restraint out of democracy?	When they abused the filibuster? 	When they denied their Constitutional duties? 	When they exploited foreign interference to win the White House? 	When they got their hands on all the levers of power, and refuse to check power?
@Silverwilllow @AngrierWHStaff I think there are several Constitutional Crises going on at the same time.	Did it begin with Big Donors? 	When @GOP seduced religious zealots into politics, indirectly violating the religious Test ban?	When they chose to thwart Obama44?	1/
@JerryFalwellJr @JeffFlake They weren't Dems, they ARE sex abuse survivors. The amount of pressure to get even a @JeffFlake to see beyond the @GOP agenda to see the harm it does to the country shows what's wrong with the Republican Party. 		Just as your tweet shows what's wrong with "Evangelicals".
@eight0nine809 @b_fung 1) They have a Utopian vision for America that comes from a yearning for the days of white domination, coverture, and a plantation mentality.

@Shareblue It. Will. Make. No. Difference.		It took a stunning amount of pressure to get @JeffFlake within arm's reach of his better angels, then he intervened w/little more than thoughts &amp; prayers. His intentions were easily minimized.		He need only have not returned to the room. Stalmate.
@MittRomney It's a nice sentiment, but that ship sank two years ago.
Not returning would have postponed the vote without making a commitment one way or the other.
.@JeffFlake should have simply not returned to the hearing. As it is, he has toppled the first domino hoping that someone else will stop them before it's too late.
@MichaelAvenatti @KellyO If he's going to be a write-in witness, with a squiggly signature, shouldn't it be a notarized piece of paper with signatures on it?

@lsolum @NancySinatra @NAACP_LDF You put your finger on the hypocrisy of originalists.
@lsolum @NancySinatra @NAACP_LDF That is why I consider "originalism" to be a tactical fraud.
@lsolum @NancySinatra @NAACP_LDF True originalism would render the 2nd amendment meaningless in today's environment. A true originalist would want 2A updated to cover modern weapons. But that would undermine their political agenda. So they hype a populist but non-originalist interpretation instead.
@lsolum @NancySinatra @NAACP_LDF The point of originalism is that the word in the written law means what it meant to the authors of the law, and not what it means over time (living document). Those who wrote the 2nd amendment saw "arms" as what was available at the time (ie muskets). That is core to originalism.

@krassenstein I don't know anything about secret hand signals, but that's not a natural or comfortable hand position. It looks like she's either pinching herself, or she just ‚õèÔ∏è her üëÉ.
@lsolum @NancySinatra @NAACP_LDF Nothing remotely resembling modern guns. And then there is the first part of the 2nd amendment, which "Originalists" seem to completely ignore.	So how does Originalism even apply to modern "gun rights"?	A semi-auto gun w/large mag is more devistating than an exploding cannonball.
@lsolum @NancySinatra @NAACP_LDF For example, 2nd amendment-	Original meaning in the culture of the time was that "arms" meant muzzleloaders &amp; swords. Weapons with, by their nature, had limited lethality. Unrifled lead balls &amp; guns that a really good shooter might be able to fire maybe 3 times/minute.
@lsolum @NancySinatra @NAACP_LDF Now that I've been able to read most of it, I'd have to say no. The author makes a point of discussing Originalism both in theory &amp; in practice. My criticism is that in practice, "Originalists" don't follow the theory with any fidelity.

The founders were concerned about the possibility of the federal government waging war on one or more states. That's why the states, not the federal govt, maintain the militias. @realDonaldTrump doesn't know this, and is testing the boundaries of personal presidential power.
Nothing in the Constitution authorizes the creation of a federal militia.	Blackwater &amp; Erik Prince got us kicked out of Iraq w/their killing spree against innocent Iraqi citizens. They also blocked rape charges from some of their women against their men.	https://t.co/zNNqd3eUDP

@realDonaldTrump Except for the part where you made it evil. 		The economy you inherited is still on track in spite of your wild debtor policies. The debt will have to be delt with eventually, if you don't completely bankrupt the government before you &amp; your party can be pried out of power.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @ACLU But Democrats make the truly hard choices when they clean up Republican messes. And Republicans make sure that those hard choices don't go unpunished. 		It is the swing of the political pendulum, and it gets more violent with every cycle. Eventually, the country will fly apart.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @ACLU Republicans don't take responsibility for the consequences of their actions because it would require admitting they were wrong (and fallible), and that would be politically damaging.		When they do something incredibly unpopular or partisan, they call it "making the hard choice".

@GOP Conservatives claim that "liberal" judges"find new rights" in the Constitution because they actually do interpret as written.	@GOP cries "living document", changing meaning!	The meaning isn't being changed, it's being applied to new problems. Problems the #GOP don't want to hear.
@GOP The text of the 14th Amendment just doesn't include such limitations.		Nevertheless, conservative judges who claim to interpret the law "as written", don't. They look for ways to reimagine the law to suit their purposes. Exactly what they accuse "liberals" of.
@GOP If @GOP truly believed in original intent, Citizens United, and many other pro-business rulings would have ended very differently.	Corporate "personhood" was never envisioned or authorized.	Equal protection was not written to apply only to what was debated at its inception.
@GOP The problem with conservative philosophy of Constitutional 'construction' is: it assumes that the Constitution &amp; Amendments were written for the moment, w/o intending to set a principal for the future.	It provides an excuse to raid the past for excuses to rule ideologically.

@Copernicus2013 @mattyglesias @realDonaldTrump @GOP So that's a "no" to honor &amp; patriotism, and a "yes" to authoritarianism.		The laws distancing the White House from @TheJusticeDept were put in place because Nixon did what #Trump is doing - manipulate the course of justice in his favor.

@perlmutations Republicans have been honorless opportunists ever since they seduced selected religious leaders into the political sphere. They've played on fear, prejudice, pride - just about every vice of human nature - for political power.	Nor do they measure up to the Ten Commandments.
@DarrellP1953 Or you weren't, and aren't. And don't want to know the details.
@kylegriffin1 .@FoxNews is the only place you can spew that üí© and go unchallenged. And even that's not such a sure thing at the moment.
@ungerbn103 @kylegriffin1 No. They're not unhinged. They know exactly what they're doing. And they're succeeding at it. 		They are remaking America according to their theoretical utopia. One based on the early 19th century. It cannot work in modern times, but it's their goal nonetheless.
@DarrellP1953 @FoxNews @jasonsehorn @WattersWorld The point is that it wasn't divisive until someone decided to rebrand it as hostile to the flag &amp; the military. It was never about the military, nor did they ever do violence to the flag. 	The point is that parts of America aren't living up to the ideals that the flag represents.
@DarrellP1953 @FoxNews @jasonsehorn @WattersWorld Would you care to guess how long the protest went on before Trump blew it up?		Pop quiz: how did he protest before he started kneeling?
@stevefox247 @ghelguy23 You want the Soviet Union back? Trump's your guy. Especially if you want to be in the Soviet Bloc.	I'll be defending America and our Constitution, and opposing Putin &amp; his puppet @POTUS .
@stevefox247 @ghelguy23 @SenJohnMcCain You're confusing the court-ordered return of property with actively damaging the alliance of the free world. 		#Trump is sabotaging our place in the free world, just as #Putin wants it.
@Lrihendry That's what your take-away is?üôÑ
@realDonaldTrump You're projecting again, fool.
@mitchellreports #Trump almost never faces the press alone, unless it's unplanned.
@ghelguy23 @SenJohnMcCain Find a copy of the Constitution and check the definition of "treason". 		#Trump is giving aid and comfort to our greatest enemy, and is helping him fracture the western alliance - which we built after WWII.		Its not the only part of the Constitution he violates routinely.
@SafetyPinDaily A little side-eye? üòí	üòé
@FoxNews @jasonsehorn @WattersWorld Their message is getting drowned out by the nationalist counter-protest. Kneeling was a compromise recommended by a veteran. It wasn't a problem until #Trump decided he wanted to make it one.
@mike_pence Eight years ago, Republicans chose obstruction over hope. As the @GOP dismantles everything that makes America great, as they continue to defy the Constitution &amp; undermine Democracy for the sake of power over we the people, it's time to choose between liberty &amp; far right tyranny.

@michaeljknowles 1. When someone shows you who they are, believe them.		2. Hysterical? That can also be said of the Right. The Left has contempt for the #SwampCreatures , especially those introduced to power by @realDonaldTrump .		Left &amp; Right disagree on just what the swamp is.
@georgesoros The EU is seeing multiple crises.	For 1, its open border (between members) wasn't designed for mass migration from so many failed states, especially Syria.		It also has not faired well against Putin's psyops against the west. White nationalism has grown, thanks to him.

@rjb1818 @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle I'm not "anti America", but do have a sense of honor instead of white nationalist "pride".	The @GOP pro-pollution agenda is literally destroying the world.

@rjb1818 @FoxNews @IngrahamAngle Half of them *did* seek asylum in Mexico, even though Mexico has problems of their own.	As long as the violence they flee is fueled by the drugs we take in, we have a moral obligation to take in those who suffer from the consequences of our sins.

@KassandraSeven @iamJxWoods @dinablue Privilege is an advantage over others. How much can one truly spread it around? Like butter, the further you spread it the thinner it gets. (To borrow from Bilbo's description of his extended life.)
@KassandraSeven @iamJxWoods @dinablue When people who have been oppressed gain their due rights, those who did the oppressing feel a loss of privilege - which they interpret as a loss of rights.

@realDonaldTrump After you sign the #GOPtaxbill, there won't be any money for infrastructure or anything else we need. Why would Democrats want to give you political cover now?
@chrislhayes The viscous cycle. 	Republicans do the damage, get voted out. 	Democrats make the hard choices needed to repair the damage, get voted out. 	Government becomes more unpopular.
@mfore0142 @JazzShaw @chrislhayes It's not that republicans used stimulus (other than tax cuts, they didn't), it's that they borrow &amp; spend.	Their goal isn't to fund the government, but to bankrupt it.
@IngrahamAngle Decent people tend to be repelled by such a blatant orgy of political brown-nosing. It brings the enforcement of separation of powers and checks on the power of the president into serious doubt. At least from republicans.

@em1692 @mrf505 @laz @KaivanShroff @Millennial_Dems @GOP Republicans have a large and well-organized &amp; funded bench of candidates. Democrats have nothing like it. They haven't run candidates in a disturbing number of elections in years. 		Strong advantage to republicans.	But unprecedented Dem candidate recruiting this year gives hope.
@em1692 @mrf505 @laz @KaivanShroff @Millennial_Dems @GOP I assume some transfer of knowledge, but no level of mentoring could be enough to fully transfer accumulated knowledge &amp; experience. Loss is unavoidable. 	Nor is there any realistic possibility that lobbying reform can happen in the current political environment.
@SaarioBrandon @tedlieu The deficit Obama inherited from Bush43 was enormous, and the economy was falling into the worst recession since the Great Depression. Obama44 stopped the collapse &amp; created historic job growth, and cut the deficit by half.
@em1692 @mrf505 @laz @KaivanShroff @Millennial_Dems @GOP Term limits would actually shift all the accumulation of expertise to lobbyists, giving them the certainty of influence (and more) beyond what they already have - and they already write many bills for republicans, and edit bills regardless of origin.

@mrf505 @em1692 @laz @KaivanShroff @Millennial_Dems @GOP 1) it's unconstitutional 	2) test bias has long been a problem in education. 	3) I guarantee the tests would either BE biased, or be ACCUSED of bias. Either way, it would undermine confidence in the democratic process.
@mrf505 @em1692 @laz @KaivanShroff @Millennial_Dems @GOP Yea, but that goes back to Jim Crow &amp; voter suppression. 	It has to be voluntary, self-motivated. Not long ago, #GOP tried to cut NEA funding for political science education, and could now succeed.

@mrf505 @em1692 @laz @KaivanShroff @Millennial_Dems Now look where the money comes from. Democrats get much, if not most, of their donations from many small donors.

The #GOPtaxbill bets the farm on flying pig futures.
@likle_wiked @realDonaldTrump He would have defaulted on the debt.
@realDonaldTrump It's funny to see repubs so passionate about adding trillions to the debt after slowing the recovery w/austerity push. 		It costs dearly to recover from republican policy failures. I have every confidence that you &amp; the @gop will create the most expensive failure in our history.
@JohnJHarwood I'd rather he served under the Constitution. They both should.
@senrobportman 137 right-wing economists. Do you have anything unbiased? From what I've seen, only hardcore republicans support the #GOPtaxbill , even those who don't believe it would work. 		Republicans are desperate for a 2017 participation trophy.
@FreedomWorks @realDonaldTrump If by "successful", you mean voting the #GOPtaxbill down, then yes. 		Otherwise, the #GopTaxScam would be the poisoning of Flint writ national.
@ThomasonDk @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump You could make America a dictatorship, kingdom, or oligarchy. All you have to do is throw out the Constitution. Until then; if you don't like them, don't vote for them.

@lynn_weiser @ZemanLynnZ @SenTedCruz @MattMackowiak @SenatorTimScott @SenSanders @SenatorCantwell @CNN @tedcruz The #GOPTaxPlan is based on political philosophy &amp;donor interests, not practical necessities. No good can come of it. 	Every time @GOP policies have failed, recovery has doubled the debt. We must break the cycle now!
@lynn_weiser @ZemanLynnZ @SenTedCruz @MattMackowiak @SenatorTimScott @SenSanders @SenatorCantwell @CNN @tedcruz How does dramatically increasing the national debt while interest rates are rising back to normal levels make dramatic tax cuts a good idea? Or even sustainable. 	With the unemployment rate at statistical "full employment" levels, why would someone expect a huge job increase?
@lynn_weiser @ZemanLynnZ @SenTedCruz @MattMackowiak @SenatorTimScott @SenSanders @SenatorCantwell @CNN @tedcruz Wage increases have been flat since the Reagan Revolution, despite productivity gains. Increasing the concentration of wealth would do nothing to improve this. 	How do we compete on labor with countries that have affordable health care for all?
@lynn_weiser @ZemanLynnZ @SenTedCruz @MattMackowiak @SenatorTimScott @SenSanders @SenatorCantwell @CNN @tedcruz The effective corporate tax rate is both low &amp; competitive. Strong profits illustrate this. The #GOPtaxbill retains incentives for taking jobs offshore. Their immigration plan focuses on people who would compete for middle class jobs, not low-wage jobs.
@JamieVullo Fallacy of over-broad generalization? 	Strawman fallacy? 	What happened to your fact-based reality? 	Forget the Great Recession? Obama keeping the Bush middle class tax cuts? 		Would you take a cut in income as a first step in balancing the family budget &amp; paying off your debt?

@SAdemocrat @KassandraSeven @TheRynheart @naretevduorp @HeideggerFan @TeaPainUSA @Rosie @JoyAnnReid @TomSteyer Articles of impeachment would have to get past Ryan to get a vote, &amp; need other republicans to pass. 	The Senate requires 2/3 to convict, &amp; Chief Justice Roberts would preside. 		He wouldn't be impeached/convicted now, &amp; there would be no second chance. Catastrophic backlash...
@SAdemocrat @KassandraSeven @TheRynheart @naretevduorp @HeideggerFan @TeaPainUSA @Rosie @JoyAnnReid @TomSteyer At a guess?	The republican base thinks that the Mueller investigation is a baseless witch hunt. It will take overwhelming evidence to make a dent in the prejudice &amp; gaslighting on the right. Rs are working up to accepting a Mueller firing. Moving now could cause a fatal backlash.
On #ThisWeek , @SenatorTimScott was asked how those who don't make enough to owe taxes would benefit from #GOPtaxbill. 		He said they would get a bigger refund. 		A bigger refund of taxes they already don't pay. 		How is that anything but a deceitful talking point?

@AlisaaGail @thehill Manafort was paid thru Ukraine. (that's why the raid) Jr. &amp; co met with several Russian agents w/The Donald's knowledge. U can start w/that.
@AlisaaGail @thehill They also came close to hacking voting machines. They planted fake stories &amp; social media bots, accounts, etc. Flynn was paid thru Turkey.
@AlisaaGail @thehill To recap: Putin had his people hack the DNC, &amp; they at least attempted to hack the RNC. He gave Wikileaks DNC docs, genuine fake &amp; modified.
@AlisaaGail @thehill For 1 thing, he was a paid unregistered foreign agent while running the #TrumpTrain. He was also involved in pro-Putin Ukrainian efforts.
