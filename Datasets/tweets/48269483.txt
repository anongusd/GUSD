@bleaning I try to name what I notice, ask questions and listen to the experiences of people around me.
@EverydaySexism Name it. I've been more haunted by what I didn't say. Better to say it even if it doesn't work in the moment.
@a_kere try replacing #Everydaysexism with everyday religious bias or racism &amp; see if it helps them understand the seriousness of all bias
@critoe @EverydaySexism I agree!
@EverydaySexism @RachelSimmet We're usually most effective when we focus on what we know best.No shortage of issues-just support each other!
@NoMorePage3 @EverydaySexism everything from boycotting ads and owners supporting incomplete media, to starting your own.
@SorshaRoberts For e.g., would we generalize about Jews or Puerto Ricans as we find ourselves generalizing ab/ women &amp; men? #EverydaySexism
@SorshaRoberts It helps to put the name of races or religions (instead of men and women), then we may see the unfairness more clearly.
@jahanarasaeed @EverydaySexism In the long term racism and sexism are intertwined and can only be uprooted together.
@jahanarasaeed @EverydaySexism Everyone experiencing a problem needs a voice in its solution.
@CarmelOfford Everyone w the power to create change, from saying what happened to enforcing rules &amp; creating a respectful atmosphere

@EverydaySexism [2/2] Be sure you have a group - which is what movements are all about.
@EverydaySexism [1/2] the deeper it is, the more important to combat it, but you can‚Äôt do it by yourself for long.
@SaskiaRombach I respond 2 a friend the way I would want them 2 respond 2 me if I said something hurtful.Not in a hostile, but an honest way
