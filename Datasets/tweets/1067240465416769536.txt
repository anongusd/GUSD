Iron Maiden - Fear of The Dark (HQ) &lt;Hereinafter Tweet&gt;	42,386,775 views		Iron Maiden	Fear of The Dark	1992		Lyrics:	I am a man who walks alone	And when I'm walking a dark road	At night or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change	I sometimes feel a little strange	A little anxious when it's dark		Fear of the dark, fear of the dark	I have a constant fear that something's	Always near	Fear of the dark, fear of the dark	I have a phobia that someone's	Always there
Have you run your fingers down	The wall	And have you felt your neck skin crawl	When you're searching for the light?	Sometimes when you're scared	To take a look	At the corner of the room	You've sensed that something's	Watching you
Thought you heard footsteps behind	And turned around and no one's there?	And as you quicken up your pace	You find it hard to look again	Because you're sure there's	Someone there
Watching horror films the night before	Debating witches and folklore	The unknown troubles on your mind	Maybe your mind is playing tricks	You sense, and suddenly eyes fix	On dancing shadows from behind
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark	I have constant fear that something's	Always near	Fear of the dark, fear of the dark	I have a phobia that someone's	Always there		When I'm walking a dark road	I am a man who walks alone	__________________

Iron Maiden - The Trooper &lt;Hereinafter Tweet&gt;	74,131,438 views		You'll take my life but I'll take yours too	You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through	So when you're waiting for the next attack	You'd better stand there's no turning back.
The Bugle sounds and the charge begins	But on this battlefield no one wins	The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath	As I plunge on into certain death.		The horse he sweats with fear we break to run	The mighty roar of the Russian guns	And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall.		We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground	And the Russians fire another round	We get so near yet so far away	We won't live to fight another day.		We get so close near enough to fight	When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow	A burst of rounds take my horse below.		And as I lay there gazing at the sky	My body's numb and my throat is dry	And as I lay forgotten and alone	Without a tear I draw my parting groan.		Category	Music		Music in this video		Learn more

Falcon 9 will launch the Crew version of their Dragon spacecraft (Dragon 2) to the International Space Station as part of the first demonstration flights of NASA's Commercial Crew Program.
The mission, called Demo-1, is currently set to launch at 2:49 a.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, from Launch Complex 39A at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. 		As part of Demo-1,...
...Demo-1, Crew Dragon will dock to the space station on March 3 (around 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time) and deliver roughly 400 pounds of supplies, including a test dummy strapped with sensors that will help let SpaceX and NASA know whether the flight is safe enough for human travelers.
On March 8, Crew Dragon will leave the ISS and splashdown into the Atlantic Ocean.		The Crew Dragon (also called Dragon 2) is SpaceX’s flagship human exploration vehicle. The company has spent nearly all of this past decade working on its development.
Since the Space Shuttle Program ended in 2011, NASA has been without a working human spaceflight system, and has instead relied on Russian Soyuz missions to get its astronauts to the ISS and back.		Liftoff window begins at 02:49 2.m. EST (07:49 GMT).

Falco - Der Kommissar (Piano Tutorial Synthesia) &lt;Hereinafter Tweet&gt;	1,860 views		"Der Kommissar" is a song first recorded by Falco in Austria in 1981, covered a year later by After the Fire.
Originally written by Robert Ponger and Falco, the Falco version reached the top of the charts in many countries.		Two, three, four	Eins, zwei drei	Na, es is nix dabei	Na, wenn ich euch erzähl' die G'schicht'	Nichts desto trotz,	Ich bin es schon gewohnt
Im TV-Funk da läuft es nicht -	Jah, sie war jung,	Das Herz so rein und weiß	Und jede Nacht hat ihren Preis,	Sie sagt: „Sugar Sweet,	Jah' got me rappin to the heat!“	Ich verstehe, sie ist heiß,	Sie sagt: „Baby, look,	I miss my funky friends“	Sie meint Jack und Joe und Jill
Mein Funkverständnis,	Ja, das reicht zur Not,	Ich überreiss', was sie jetzt will -	Ich überleg' bei mir,	Ihr' Nasen spricht dafür,	Währenddessen ich noch rauch',	Die Special Places sind ihr wohlbekannt,	Ich mein', sie führt ja U-Bahn auch	Dort singen's:	„Drah' di net um, oh oh oh
Schau, schau, der Kommissar geht um! Oh oh oh	Er wird dich anschauen	Und du weißt warum	Die Lebenslust bringt di um“	Alles klar, Herr Kommissar?	Hey man, wanna buy some stuff, man?	Did you ever rap that thing Jack?	So rap it to the beat!	Wir treffen Jill and Joe
Und dessen Bruder hip	Und auch den Rest der coolen Gang	Sie rappen hin, sie rappen her	Dazwischen Kratzen's ab die Wänd' -	Dieser Fall ist klar,	Lieber Herr Kommissar,	Auch wenn Sie and'rer Meinung sind:	Den Schnee auf dem wir alle	Talwärts fahr'n,	Kennt heute jedes Kind

Lyrics: 		Please allow me to introduce myself	I'm a man of wealth and taste	I've been around for a long, long year	Stole many a man's soul and faith		I was 'round when Jesus Christ	Had his moment of doubt and pain	Made damn sure that Pilate	Washed his hands and sealed his fate
Pleased to meet you	Hope you guess my name	But what's puzzling you	Is the nature of my game		I stuck around St. Petersberg	When I saw it was a time for a change	Killed the Czar and his ministers	Anastasia screamed in vain	I rode a tank	Held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged	And the bodies stank		Pleased to meet you	Hope you guess my name, oh yeah	What's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah
I watched with glee as your kings and queens	Fought for ten decades	For the Gods they made	I shouted out	"Who killed the Kennedys?"	When after all	It was you and me
Let me please introduce myself	I'm a man of wealth and taste	And I lay traps for troubadours	Who get killed before they reach Bombay		Pleased to meet you	Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah	But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game, oh yeah	Well, get down, hit it
Pleased to meet you	Hope you guess my name, oh yeah	But what's confusin’ you is just the nature of my game		Just as every cop is a criminal	And all the sinners saints	As heads is tails just call me Lucifer	'Cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me	Have some courtesy	Have some sympathy, and some taste	Use all your well-learned politesse	Or I'll lay your soul to waste, mmm yeah	Pleased to meet you	Hope you guess my name, mmm yeah	But what's puzzling you is the nature of my game

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:	Henry VII (Welsh: Harri Tudur; 28 January 1457 – 21 April 1509) was King of England and Lord of Ireland from seizing the crown on 22 August 1485 until his death on 21 April 1509, and the first monarch of the House of Tudor.
Henry won the throne when his forces defeated King Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field, the culmination of the Wars of the Roses. Henry was the last king of England to win his throne on the field of battle. He cemented his claim by...
...claim by marrying Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV and niece of Richard III. Henry was successful in restoring the power and stability of the English monarchy after the civil war, and after a reign of nearly 24 years, he was peacefully succeeded by his son, Henry VIII.
Henry can also be credited with a number of administrative, economic and diplomatic initiatives. He paid very close attention to detail, and instead of spending lavishly he concentrated on raising new revenues.
His new taxes were unpopular and when Henry VIII succeeded him he executed his two most hated tax collectors.		His supportive stance of the islands' wool industry and stand off with the Low Countries had long lasting benefits to all the British Isles economy.
However, the capriciousness and lack of due process that indebted many would tarnish his legacy and were soon ended upon Henry VII's death, after a commission revealed widespread abuses.
According to the contemporary historian Polydore Vergil, simple "greed" underscored the means by which royal control was over-asserted in Henry's final years.		Category	Education

You'd rather not be here at all	Alcohol 	How do you do it? 	Please don't do it to me 	You give some people a real good time 	But you cause some untold misery	Alcohol 	Why do you do it? 	You ain't gonna do it to me 	You give some people a real good time

And catch 22 says if I sing the truth	They won't make me an overnight star	Don't offer us legal protection	They use the law to commit crime	I dread to think what the future will bring	When we're living in gangster time	Bernie Rhodes knows don't argue		Category	Music

The New York Times 		SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 2019		What to Cook This Week	Sam Sifton SAM SIFTON		Good morning. I write from an airport as I often seem to do these days, en route to Las Vegas for reasons of commerce not games.
It seems a very long way from the pleasures of the kitchen and though I will seek the delicious, I know vile food will find me, and I will consider it fine. That is the way of the traveler.
Today I’m living through you, for you, in the hopes that you’ll cook something perfect for people you love this week and in doing so instill in them the understanding that eating well is something that’s much more than sustenance,...
...that it’s central to our experience as humans who care for one another, that it actually makes life better than it is when you’re housing wings at a bar near the Delta gate.	Like, if I could?...
...I’d make a big batch of chicken curry today, a recipe I learned from Meera Sodha, and accompany it with a stack of her aunt Harsha’s naan. I’d serve it to the family with raita and a bowl of mango chutney. I can’t, though, so will you? Watch the Oscars afterward!
For Monday’s meal, I’d cook Melissa Clark’s baked skillet pasta with Cheddar and spiced onions (above), a meatless dinner of uncommon goodness beside a lemony green salad.
Tuesday might be a sheet-pan dinner of sausage parm with garlicky broccoli and sesame bread from the bakery near the police precinct. Maybe make that loaf, whatever loaf you can find, into garlic bread? This sounds like a wonderful night.
Wednesdays are hard. Midweek is when the wheels come off whatever plans for cooking you set in motion today. But this dinner of fish with shiitakes is so simple it might give you a win, even if the commute home’s a disaster after a meetings-filled day.
Thursday you can reach again, and make this nice lamb and white bean chili. But don’t eat it! Sometimes be radical in your cooking life. Order in a pizza instead, or whatever delivery meal brings you the most joy.
This action will allow the chili to cure overnight in the refrigerator, so you can reheat it on Friday evening and taste it at its matured best. Tip well, please. Good behavior comes around, every time.
Thousands and thousands and thousands of other recipes to cook this week are on NYT Cooking. Yes, you do need a subscription to access them. Subscriptions keep us in groceries and health insurance, same as money exchanged for lobsters allows fishermen to pay their mortgages.
You can get further inspiration for free, though, at our new NYT Cooking Facebook group, where you can connect with other home cooks. It’s a place where you can share tips, tricks and talk to experts — even me! Join now. Or follow us on our Instagram, Twitter and Facebook feeds.
And if you run into trouble with the paperwork, you can always ask us for help: cookingcare@nytimes.com.	Now, it’s hardly a recipe, I know, but I liked India Mandelkern on Alison Pearlman’s book about restaurant menus, “May We Suggest,” in the Los Angeles Review of Books.
Ranging farther afield, here are two articles in The Times you shouldn’t miss: Michael Shaw on the story behind an iconic photograph of the Vietnam War; and Dan Bilefsky on French immigrants to Montreal.	The Cut has a good travel riff: “Who Killed Tulum?”
And, finally, because I’ve been puzzling over it for two weeks now, see what you think of the Dolly Parton tribute at the Grammys. See you tomorrow!
