That provider should know when or if a gold-standard treatment needs to be modified within the context of pregnancy. #NIMHchats
Treatment of any psychiatric disorder during pregnancy needs to be viewed under a treatment lens that takes the pregnancy into account. We are not able to provide specific medical advice, but what we can say is seeking treatment from a reputable provider is critical. #NIMHchats https://t.co/7a6zNh73ID
You may also have to look outside of your university to try to work with clinicians or researchers working with eating disorders. #NIMHchats
One way to prepare is to find out what research and/or clinical training is currently going on in your university. Make contact with those people providing that research or clinical training. #NIMHchats https://t.co/3UhMpqqVt3
Behavioral analysis could certainly be one means of trying to understand an eating disorder. The treatment of eating disorders is very complicated. Different health care professionals working as a team are often required to adequately address these disorders. #NIMHchats https://t.co/wcqkBenMlL
@samhsagov also has a Behavioral Health Treatment Locator on its website (https://t.co/9yxqQJAShs). #NIMHchats
It is critical to seek treatment from a reputable health care provider. For general info on mental health and to locate treatment services, call the @samhsagov Treatment Referral Helpline at 1–800–662–HELP (4357). #NIMHchats https://t.co/YtXSB5fZwR
Treatments for the different disorders can vary or may be similar with slight modifications. For example, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is often used to treat certain eating disorders but may be slightly modified depending on the disorder. #NIMHchats https://t.co/oFxUDsoowF
Eating disorders often appear during the teen years or young adulthood, and may also develop during childhood or later in life. Anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder are distinct, but there can be overlapping features across these disorders. #NIMHchats https://t.co/HT1GgJivCz
Focus on health rather than weight, and be willing to offer support with contacting health care providers and sticking to treatment. Caring isn't being nosy! #NIMHchats
Creating a safe space is a good idea. It's important to be there for your friends or family who may be struggling. Listen carefully and learn what the individual is thinking and feeling. #NIMHchats https://t.co/RguhjqS1Yr
A critical thing is to identify and treat eating disorders as early as possible because research shows that the earlier they're treated, the better the outcome. #NIMHchats
If these are not recognized early on, they can lead to a more serious eating disorder. Even people who have recovered from eating disorder still have to be vigilant about not falling back into patterns that could cause a relapse. #NIMHchats
There are different phases of eating disorders which reflect different levels of severity. At the early stages, there may be sub-threshold symptoms that don't manifest as a full-blown eating disorder. #NIMHchats https://t.co/UOAaXyXLj2
Treatment teams may also include a nutritionist. Different treatments may work better for different people. What is important is working with a well-trained treatment provider who is aware of various options. #NIMHchats
For example, a physician may be looking at medical issues, and a psychologist or psychiatrist may be looking at behavioral and psychological factors associated with these disorders. #NIMHchats
Completely agree! The treatment of eating disorders is very complicated. Different health care professionals working as a team are often required to adequately address these disorders. #NIMHchats https://t.co/X5FFKW7A2h
Individual eating disorders are very serious medical and psychiatric conditions and if you think you're suffering from an eating disorder or a combination of eating disorders, the critical thing is to seek help. Tools and resources available at https://t.co/7F5VOf3w7w. #NIMHchats
Quite often, people with one disorder can cross over to another disorder. That can happen with a relatively high frequency, for example, crossing over from anorexia nervosa to bulimia nervosa. #NIMHchats https://t.co/KkFLmmP1LU
More information about the warning signs of eating disorders is available at https://t.co/OHTxJOnb5g #NIMHchats
There is not a simple yes or no answer–it depends on the context and circumstances of a given individual. What is critical is understanding the maladaptive behaviors that may contribute to an eating disorder vs. other eating behaviors that may be beneficial or benign. #NIMHchats https://t.co/zlRQuwRQnX

What are your questions about the common types of eating disorders? #NIMHchats
A2: OSFED pertains to those individuals who have a clinically significant disturbance in eating behavior, such as Loss of Control (LOC), which is the subjective experience of an inability to stop eating, regardless of the amount of food consumed. (2/2) #NIMHchats #NEDAwareness
A2: Eating Disorders Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS) was renamed Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED) in the DSM-5. (1/2) #NIMHchats #NEDAwareness
A2: People with ARFID are not able to meet their nutritional or energy needs because of their food avoidance and restriction, and typically experience significant weight loss and nutritional deficiency. ARFID was introduced as a new disorder in the DSM-5. (3/3) #NIMHchats
A2: For some, food restriction may be based on intolerance of the sensory characteristics of some foods (such as smell, taste or texture) or because of a negative response associated with the food, such as choking or repeated vomiting after eating a certain food. (2/3) #NIMHchats
A2: Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is an eating/feeding disturbance in which people avoid certain foods or restrict food intake. Unlike anorexia, people with this disorder do not restrict or avoid food intake b/c of fear of gaining weight. (1/3) #NIMHchats
A2: There are two other categories that include eating disorders that do not meet the criteria for anorexia, bulimia, or binge-eating. #NIMHchats #NEDAwareness
A2: People with binge-eating disorder lose control over their eating. Unlike bulimia, periods of binge-eating are not followed by purging, excessive exercise, or fasting. As a result, people with binge-eating disorder are often overweight or obese. #NIMHchats #NEDAwareness
A2: Remember, people with eating disorders may appear healthy, yet be extremely ill. #NIMHchats #NEDAwareness
A2: Unlike anorexia, people with bulimia may maintain a normal weight. But like people with anorexia, they often have an intense fear of gaining weight, want desperately to lose weight, and are intensely unhappy with their body size and shape. #NIMHchats #NEDAwareness
A2: Bulimia nervosa is characterized by binge eating (eating a large amount of food in a short time and feeling a lack of control over the eating) followed by behaviors that compensate for the overeating, such as forced vomiting, fasting, and/or excessive exercise. #NIMHchats
A2: If you think someone is at risk for self-harm, call 911 immediately, contact the toll-free National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at @800273TALK or text the @CrisisTextLine (text “HOME” to 741741). These resources are free and confidential 24/7. #NIMHchats
A2: Anorexia nervosa has the highest mortality (death) rate of *any* mental disorder. People with anorexia may die from medical conditions and complications associated with starvation; people with some eating disorders can be at higher risk for suicide. #NIMHchats #NEDAwareness
A2: There are 2 subtypes of anorexia nervosa: a restrictive subtype (severe restrictions on the amount and type of food consumed) and binge-purge subtype (severe restrictions on the amount and type of food they consume with possible binge eating and purging behaviors). #NIMHchats
A2: People with anorexia nervosa avoid food, severely restrict food, or eat very small quantities of only certain foods, leading to significantly low body weight. They may have an intense fear of gaining weight even when they are dangerously underweight. #NIMHchats #NEDAwareness

A3: Current research suggests that depression is caused by a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. #NIMHchats https://t.co/XYMimqRAL5
Q3: What are some of the risk factors for teens with depression? #NIMHchats https://t.co/HO6eBddXcI
Let’s move on to the risk factors and treatment options for depression in teenagers. #NIMHchats
It’s a two-way street. Children with depression are at higher risk for abusing substances and children who abuse substances are at higher risk for becoming depressed. #NIMHchats https://t.co/uHDw15milc
We’ve received a lot of good questions! If we didn’t get to your question yet, please be patient. We’ll have more time at the end and we’ll try to answer as many as we can. #NIMHchats
Yes please! https://t.co/kiYpjIdDpm
People can have low mood for a very long duration. It’s important to make the distinction between low mood and the full syndrome of depression. A mental health professional is in the best position to assess. Use these resources to find help: https://t.co/ZbEkTEzswi #NIMHchats https://t.co/HLyQATSDy2
What are your questions about the signs and symptoms of depression in teenagers? #NIMHchats
A2: Remember, not everyone who is depressed experiences every symptom. Some people experience only a few symptoms while others may experience many. https://t.co/dDd0rxQC2F #NIMHchats https://t.co/fOBdcnLdJF
A2: The @CrisisTextLine is another free and confidential resource available 24/7 when you’re in crisis, which is any painful emotion for which you need support. Text “HOME” to 741741 in the United States to be connected to a Crisis Counselor over text message. #NIMHchats https://t.co/p4ZAgq7yRl
A2: Another possible symptom of depression is thinking about harming yourself, dying, or suicide. If you’re in a crisis and need help, call this toll-free number available 24/7: 1-800-273-TALK (8255). All calls are confidential. #NIMHchats @800273TALK https://t.co/fOBdcnLdJF
A2: People may find they are spending more time alone, withdrawing from friends and family, and having trouble with school and work. They also may think things won’t get any better and they think about death or wish they were never born. #NIMHchats https://t.co/fOBdcnLdJF
A2: If you’re always feeling tired or restless; have trouble concentrating, remembering information, or making decisions; or have aches, pains, or stomach problems without a clear cause, these could also be signs of depression. #NIMHchats (4/4) https://t.co/Iigj5GxBeN
A2: There also are physical changes such as too much or too little eating, too much or too little sleeping, and having less energy. (3/4) #NIMHchats https://t.co/nkCe1DcdEc
A2: Along with these mood features and loss of pleasure there are changes in thinking—seeing things as more hopeless, thinking you’re worthless or helpless, and feeling guilty about things. #NIMHchats (2/4) https://t.co/tFPLZHKmI3
A2: Symptoms of depression may include feeling sad or more irritable than usual on most days. This mood change goes along with not feeling much pleasure in activities you used to enjoy. #NIMHchats (1/4) https://t.co/fOBdcnLdJF
A2: It’s normal to feel sad after a loss or setback. Feeling sad at times is something everyone experiences–but it usually passes after a short time. Depression is different. #NIMHchats https://t.co/fOBdcnLdJF
Q2: What are some of the signs and symptoms of depression in teens? #NIMHchats https://t.co/hi49S7gD6f
A1: Depression impacts how a person thinks about his or her abilities and future. For some people, depression can result in severe impairments that interfere with or limit one’s ability to carry out major life activities. https://t.co/dDd0rxQC2F #NIMHchats (2/2)
A1: Depression (major depressive disorder) is a medical illness that can cause symptoms that interfere with one’s daily activities—such as sleeping, eating, or concentrating on school work. #NIMHchats (1/2) https://t.co/IVP2gYTPGr
A1: But if you’ve been overwhelmingly sad for a long time (a couple of weeks to months) and the things you usually enjoy no longer bring you much satisfaction, you may want to talk to a trusted adult. It could be you’re having an episode of depression. #NIMHchats (2/2)
A1: During your teenage years, changes are taking place in your body and brain that can affect how you learn, think, and behave. And if you’re facing tough or stressful situations, it’s normal to have emotional ups and downs. #NIMHchats (1/2)
Let's get started! Q1: What is depression? #NIMHchats https://t.co/TjF3sGWiO8

A6: Side effects from light therapy are relatively few and minor. Some cases of eye irritation, headache, nausea or jitteriness usually respond to sitting further from light or gradual dosing #NIMHchats https://t.co/zwhkxczCpa
A6: Light treatment not only compensates for the reduced daylight hours of winter, but its ability to suppress melatonin production may help advance the circadian rhythms often delayed in SAD. #NIMHchats https://t.co/zwhkxczCpa
A6: Sitting about two feet from the light box (positioned at eye level or higher), a person can multitask, e.g. read, eat, or just relax, glancing at the light every minute or so. #NIMHchats (2/2) https://t.co/M4rs4Gf3LT
A6: Light therapy is best done first thing in the morning, typically for 30 – 60 minutes (starting with 10 – 15 min).  #NIMHchats (1/2) https://t.co/zwhkxczCpa
A6: Light treatment or “phototherapy” uses a special lamp with a very bright light (with an intensity of 10,000 lux) that mimics light from the sun. Light boxes typically use rows of full-spectrum fluorescent bulbs, filtering out ultraviolet rays. #NIMHchats https://t.co/zwhkxczCpa

A4: People with SAD also may produce less vitamin D. Vitamin D is believed to play a role in serotonin activity. Vitamin D insufficiency may be associated with clinically significant depressive symptoms. #NIMHchats https://t.co/auJzEM8dCL
A4: Less available light in winter may cause a “phase delay” in circadian rhythms in people with SAD. Oftentimes, there may be multiple factors converging to create dysregulation of otherwise normal biological functioning. #NIMHchats https://t.co/auJzEM8dCL
A4: People with SAD may overproduce the hormone melatonin. Darkness increases production of melatonin, which regulates sleep. The fewer hours of sunlight in the fall and winter can disrupt the body's melatonin levels and daily rhythm. #NIMHchats https://t.co/auJzEM8dCL
A4: Preliminary evidence from PET brain scans has shown that the usually low levels of the transporter protein for serotonin are elevated during the winter in some people with SAD, reducing the availability of serotonin. #NIMHchats (2/2) https://t.co/6dyl2ZD94t

A8: “Never hesitate to ask for help. Talk to a family member, friends, teacher, or health care provider.” – Dr. David Sommers, @NIMHgov #NIHhealthy2018 https://t.co/QOazrJpPWt
A7: Scientific studies support the positive impact of mindfulness practices on several markers of biological and physiological well-being. -Dr. David Sommers, @NIMHgov #NIHhealthy2018 https://t.co/ZW5Q1jSSQR
Learn more about these techniques on the @NIH_NCCIH website: https://t.co/9GidnsQ7fM #NIHhealthy2018
"There's accumulating evidence that these types of practices, which have been around for thousands of years, help reduce stress. Consistent practice and use of these techniques is an important element of having them help over the long term." - Dr. David Sommers, @NIMHgov https://t.co/16lccwgmxP
A5: Currently, the NIMH is funding several research studies related to mindfulness, stress &amp; how mindfulness may play a role in treatment for depression, schizophrenia, and other mood disorders. Check out RePORT: https://t.co/Fr03ccZHBP #NIHhealthy2018
A5: For more tips on managing stress, read our publication, 5 Things to Know About Stress: https://t.co/cIZnIcLb0T #NIHhealthy2018
A5: The effects of stress tend to build up over time. Taking practical steps to manage stress can reduce or prevent these effects. There are many ways to cope with stress if you recognize the signs. Be sure to talk to your doctor and get regular exercise to start! #NIHhealthy2018
A5: Anyone experiencing long-term, unrelenting stress can become overwhelmed. If you or a loved one is having thoughts of suicide, call the toll-free National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at @800273TALK available 24/7 days a week: https://t.co/AoFW9lwqcI #NIHhealthy2018 https://t.co/M2l88W7EMd
A3: For information on taking the first step and tips on what to consider when looking for a therapist, visit our webpage on psychotherapies: https://t.co/Nrw0euFQS8 #NIHhealthy2018
A3: Psychotherapy is a term for a variety of treatment techniques that aim to help a person identify and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behavior. Most psychotherapy takes place with a licensed and trained mental health care professional #NIHhealthy2018
A3: If you’ve been dealing with severe or long-term stress, it’s a good idea to talk to your primary care practitioner about treatment like psychotherapy, otherwise known as “talk therapy.” #NIHhealthy2018 https://t.co/Gwu1Q6oF7K
Emotional health is a broad concept to measure in a scientific way. We might look at things like depression, anxiety, and suicide rates which are signals of overall emotional health. There are epidemiological surveys on these topics, but "emotional health" is a bit too broad. https://t.co/YJq8MmxnZc
Second, it depends on the severity of the maladaptive coping mechanisms. If you're talking about something like drinking too much, use of illicit drugs, etc., you probably need to talk to a professional to begin to get some help. - Dr. David Sommers, @NIMHgov https://t.co/uverIo36o2
First thing you need is a specific concrete plan. You should put the plan in writing because there's evidence that writing your goals down helps people stick to forming new habits. - Dr. David Sommers, @NIMHgov https://t.co/uverIo36o2
A2: However not all stress is bad! Stress can motivate people to prepare or perform, and can even be life-saving in some situations. There are also ways to manage stress: https://t.co/w5ya4IVKcU #NIHhealthy2018 https://t.co/0VGtzkLmK5

Learn more about this study and others at https://t.co/biXjXAaseb. Search for “clozapine” AND “BEN” #NIMHchats
The NIMH-funded study is also aiming to understand the genetic underpinnings of this condition #NIMHchats
The study, which has sites in the U.S. &amp; Nigeria, is looking at the safety of clozapine in Africans &amp; African Americans w/BEN  #NIMHchats
BEN makes many people of African background ineligible to receive clozapine, which is used for treatment-resistant schizophrenia  #NIMHchats
Many patients of African background have a genetically-based low white blood cell count, aka Benign Ethnic Neutropenia (BEN)  #NIMHchats
One current NIMH-funded study is looking at the safety of clozapine in Africans &amp; African Americans w/ Benign Ethnic Neutropenia  #NIMHchats
Some clinical research studies aim to understand whether meds work differently in different racial/ethnic groups #NIMHchats
For many people, a combination of meds and psychotherapy is most effective. #NIMHchats
Therapy can also help men understand &amp; work through difficult situations or relationships that may be causing their #depression #NIMHchats
Therapy teaches new ways of thinking and behaving, and changing habits that may be contributing to the #depression #NIMHchats
Several types of therapy can help treat #depression. Some are just as effective as medications for certain types of depression #NIMHchats
Treatment for mental disorders should be personalized. There's no one size fits all treatment. #NIMHchats
Medications called antidepressants can work well to treat #depression #NIMHchats
The earlier that treatment can begin, the more effective it is #NIMHchats
A common belief among the African American community is that getting help is the same as telling your business to a stranger #NIMHchats

Sometimes, meds taken for these illnesses may cause side effects that cause #depression #NIMHchats
#Depression can make these conditions worse, &amp; vice versa #NIMHchats
#Depression can co-occur with other serious medical illnesses such as #diabetes, #cancer, heart disease, &amp; #Parkinson’s disease #NIMHchats
Men with a family history of #depression may be more likely to develop it than those whose family members do not #NIMHchats
Other factors may also cause depression such as genetic and biological factors #NIMHchats
These factors increase African Americans’ chances of developing depression or other mental illnesses #NIMHchats
African Americans are more likely to experience economic distress, racism, and other social circumstances #NIMHchats
.@HarrismckoyMFT We agree! #NIMHchats
. @ManUpManDownMSU Yes, check out this brochure: https://t.co/SvINySQaT9 #NIMHchats
. @slygote True for older white men, but not across the lifespan. Rates are rising among younger African American men. #NIMHchats
. @MJASpeakers Historically, African Americans have relied on religious and social communities for emotional support  #NIMHchats
. @MJASpeakers Cultural mistrust of mental health professionals &amp; health care professionals is common  #NIMHchats
. @embpd because men are less likely to seek treatment for BPD #NIMHchats
.@Reach4MoJOYRN great point! #NIMHchats
To learn more about the signs and symptoms of #depression and men, visit: https://t.co/vg7fxd44fk.  #NIMHchats
Men also may be more likely to have difficulty sleeping than women who have #depression. #NIMHchats
Men may be more likely to feel very tired and irritable, and lose interest in their work, family, or hobbies.  #NIMHchats
Beyond sadness, men who are depressed often experience anger, aggression, substance abuse, &amp; risky behavior.  #NIMHchats
Both men and women get #depression, but men can experience it differently than women. #NIMHchats
Although depression is common, it is a serious mood disorder that can affect how you feel, think, &amp; handle your daily life. #NIMHchats
A common belief among the African American community is that being depressed is normal and talking about it is weak #NIMHchats
In what ways does depression affect African American men differently than other races and genders? #NIMHchats
. @MJASpeakers Support a friend by reaching out and keeping in touch. More ways to support: https://t.co/sTyHHr3nFU #NIMHchats
. @MJASpeakers Remind your loved one that with time and treatment, he will feel better. #NIMHchats
. @MJASpeakers first help him find a doctor or mental health professional and make an appointment #NIMHchats
. @caretothepeople The best place to start is a man's main concern, which is often physical symptoms and then go from there #NIMHchats
Untreated mental disorders can make African American men vulnerable to substance abuse, homelessness, incarceration &amp; homicide #NIMHchats
African American men are four times more likely to die by suicide than African American women.  #NIMHchats
Suicide is the third leading cause of death among African Americans 15 to 23 years old.  #NIMHchats
Men are less likely to get help, especially African American men.  #NIMHchats

. @Hkkeller1 Bipolar I includes distinct manic episodes. DMDD is no episodes, just chronic persistent irritability.	#NIMHchats
. @nned_net Irritability runs in families to the same extent as depressionn and anxiety do. 	#NIMHchats
. @Troybpink no regarding genetic testing #NIMHchats
. @nani17adrit Irritability in bipolar occurs during episodes of mania or depression. In DMDD, it is chronic, not in episodes. #NIMHchats
. @nned_net DMDD is a fairly new diagnosis, appearing for the first time in the DSM-5 published in 2013. https://t.co/XZx2W7UC3U #NIMHchats
Parent training also focuses on being predictable and consistent with children, and rewarding positive behavior. #NIMHchats
Parent training teaches ways to foresee events that might lead to a temper outburst &amp; how to work ahead to prevent the outburst. #NIMHchats
. @changematrix Parent training may give parents ways to help a child to reduce aggression and irritable behavior #NIMHchats
. @changematrix It is very difficult to parent an irritable child. #NIMHchats
. @algcolvin We don't exactly know, but it's possible that psychological treatments are being underused. #NIMHchats
. @TheBRAINBeat Psychologists can also provide psychological treatment. #NIMHchats
. @NevadaPEP A good start is: https://t.co/UVazrkU4U5 #NIMHchats
. @ALoysiuschOW Some evidence for CBT in aggressive kids. Testing it in DMDD now. #NIMHchats
. @ALoysiuschOW What we are testing now is mostly behavioral therapies and computer-based training: https://t.co/ke2vaQ3P0S #NIMHchats
. @ALoysiuschOW Computer-based training that addresses this problem may help youth w/DMDD or severe irritability #NIMHchats
. @ALoysiuschOW Irritable youth may misread subtle facial expressions as angry. https://t.co/IdzpOEFvMa #NIMHchats
. @ALoysiuschOW New techniques might help teach children coping skills for handling anger. Learn more: https://t.co/UiZA18hw50 #NIMHchats
. @ALoysiuschOW CBT used to teach children how to deal with thoughts &amp; feelings that contribute to feeling depressed or anxious. #NIMHchats
. @ALoysiuschOW Psychological treatments should be considered first, with medication added later if necessary  #NIMHchats
. @Troybpink We are not sure. Children with language problems may be at increased risk. #NIMHchats
However, it’s common for youth with ADHD to also be very irritable, so a child may have both diagnoses #NIMHchats
DMDD is characterized by irritability. ADHD is characterized by hyperactivity and inattention. #NIMHchats
We received this question in advance: What is the difference between ADD/HD and DMDD? #NIMHchats
. @reetpoudel Irritability is very common in kids with ADHD. We're trying to understand why  #NIMHchats
. @PLMathews In kids with irritability and lots of aggression, atypical antipsychotic meds may help.  #NIMHchats
. @PLMathews In kids who also have ADHD, stimulants probably help with irritability too. We are testing antidepressants now. #NIMHchats
. @ResearchAmerica Genetics and environment both play a role. Definitely more research is needed. #NIMHchats
. @infobookcom We are trying to understand the brain mechanisms #NIMHchats
. @washparentmag Also, at risk for less income and for not getting as much education #NIMHchats
. @washparentmag Irritable kids are at increased risk for depression and anxiety as they grown up. #NIMHchats
. @Troybpink Irritability is moderately heritable. That means it's about as genetic as depression or anxiety. #NIMHchats
. @changematrix Not as far as we know at this point. #NIMHchats
To be diagnosed with DMDD, a child must have these symptoms steadily for 12 or more months. #NIMHchahts
A child with DMDD also experiences trouble functioning due to irritability in more than one place (e.g., home, school, w/peers) #NIMHchats
Also, severe temper outbursts about 3 or more times a week that are out of keeping w/the situation &amp; child’s developmental level #NIMHchats
A child with DMDD experiences irritable or angry mood most of the day, nearly every day. #NIMHchats
DMDD symptoms typically begin before the age of 10, but the diagnosis is not given to children under 6 or adolescents over 18. #NIMHchats
. @washparentmag Trouble making and keeping friends because of their outbursts and because they are generally cranky. #NIMHchats
. @washparentmag lots of outbursts at home and school when frustrated or when ppl ask them to do things they don't want to. #NIMHchats
According to the DSM criteria, adults cannot be diagnosed with DMDD. There hasn't been enough research on adult irritability.  #NIMHchats
According to the DSM criteria, adults cannot be diagnosed with DMDD. There hasn't been enough research on adults irritability. #NIMHchats
DMDD is a fairly new diagnosis, appearing for the first time in the DSM-5 published in 2013. https://t.co/XZx2W8cdsu #NIMHchats
DMDD symptoms go beyond being a “moody” child. Children with DMDD experience severe impairment that requires clinical attention. #NIMHchats

Watch NIMH expert Dr. Rezvan Ameli discuss practicing mindfulness at work: https://t.co/A5ZqgcCBSY #ChatStress
Mindfulness has brought about a paradigm shift in promoting physical, psychological, and even spiritual health and development. #ChatStress
Scientific studies support the impact of mindfulness at cellular, circuitry, physiological, behavioral, &amp; self-report levels. #ChatStress
The Nun study, Shamatha project , New England family study, happiness research at Harvard,  have all provided important insights #ChatStress
Most mindfulness teachers recommend regular even daily practice for 20 min-1 hour #ChatStress
A recent study supports that MBCT and medications have similar effects in relapse prevention for depression. #ChatStress
In addition to MBSR, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is another widely used program #ChatStress
Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has provided the framework for developing several other programs. #ChatStress
Brain function, structure, and activity are affected by meditative and mindfulness practice #ChatStress
Other conditions include: addictions, eating disorders, chronic pain, autoimmune disorders, heart disease, and blood pressure #ChatStress
Mindfulness has been successfully used as an adjunct treatment for depression, anxiety, sleep disorders &amp; other conditions #ChatStress
Mindfulness has been successfully used for all age groups and in settings like schools, hospitals, military, clinics &amp; busines #ChatStress
Currently, the NIMH is funding several research studies related to mindfulness. Check out RePORT: https://t.co/Fr03ccZHBP #ChatStress
With Mindfulness, we also practice: patience, acceptance, letting go, trust, non-judgement, non-striving &amp; a beginners mind #ChatStress
Mindfulness requires a compassionate and friendly attitude towards self and others. #ChatStress
Mindfulness is a conscious act – you need to choose into it. No one can make you mindful. That's why intention is so important. #ChatStress
Mindfulness essentials are intention, attention, and attitude. #ChatStress
Mindfulness is a secular approach within clinical medicine and psychology. #ChatStress

By doing brain imaging studies in former athletes, we can learn more about CTE and how to better diagnose it in future patients. #NIMHchats
CTE symptoms: impaired memory &amp; cognition, impulsivity, aggression, depression, suicidality &amp; diminished motor control #NIMHchats
Symptoms of CTE may not become evident until years after the brain injuries occurred #NIMHchats
A “subconcussive injury” is a brain injury that does not result in concussion symptoms. #NIMHchats
CTE may be caused by repetitive exposure to subconcussive hits to the head, even w/no history of a clinically evident head injury #NIMHchats
Athletes such as boxers, football players, and hockey players have often had many mild brain injuries #NIMHchats
CTE has been diagnosed at autopsy in former athletes #NIMHchats
There is no current diagnostic test for CTE. CTE can only be diagnosed by examining brain tissue under a microscope at autopsy #NIMHchats
NIMH researchers are testing a new compound to detect abnormal brain proteins as a method to diagnose CTE in living patients #NIMHchats
Brain imaging tests like CT scan and MRI usually look normal after a concussion, even though the brain has been injured. #NIMHchats
The @NFL donated $30 million to @FNIH_Org for research studies on injuries affecting athletes, which focus on brain trauma #NIMHchats
Moderate to severe TBI requires rehab, such as physical speech &amp; occupational therapy, counseling &amp; social services support #NIMHchats
Medical personnel stabilize the person’s condition by ensuring an adequate supply of blood &amp; oxygen to  brain &amp; rest of the body #NIMHchats
RT @NINDSnews Welcome Dr. Walter Koroshetz @NINDSDirector to the chat! #NIMHchats

How is TBI treated? #NIMHchats
Concussions can occur when wearing a helmet #NIMHchats
Unfortunately, no helmet or other protective equipment provides 100% protection against concussions #NIMHchats
Also, neck conditioning, strict rule enforcement, stiffer penalties, increased player respect &amp; improved coaching techniques #NIMHchats
Equipment like helmets/head gear, mouth guards and face shields are common concussion prevention strategies #NIMHchats
How can you prevent sports-related head injury? #NIMHchats
Don’t forget to tweet us your questions by 3 pm ET! #NIMHchats
. @NFLObjectors Many symptoms of concussion are subjective. Many athletes aren't aware that they have a concussion. #NIMHchats
. @NFLObjectors Determining if certain sx are related to concussion or signal a serious head injury is a major challenge #NIMHchats
Most people recover fully after a concussion, but it can take some time. Rest is very important. #NIMHchats
Doctors use a neurologic exam, cognitive tests, and sometimes imaging tests to diagnose a concussion #NIMHchats
In most people, post-concussion syndrome symptoms occur within the first seven to 10 days and go away within three months #NIMHchats
. @NFLObjectors There are a lot of reasons why an athlete may be more prone to another concussion if they return to play too soon #NIMHchats
. @NFLObjectors We are looking into the long-term consequences of concussion. #NIMHchats
Symptoms like headaches and dizziness can last for weeks and sometimes months after the injury that caused the concussion #NIMHchats
Post-concussion syndrome can occur after a concussion #NIMHchats
Deficits in cognitive, behavioral and motor control normally persist from 24 h to 10 days after injury #NIMHchats
Common symptoms include headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion, memory impairment, imbalance, and behavioral changes #NIMHchats
. @SammyKatta Guidelines include: resting and not returning to play until the patient is without symptoms.  #NIMHchats
Symptoms of a concussion may not start right away. They may start days or weeks after the injury #NIMHchats
Mild TBI, like concussion, can cause long-term cognitive problems that affect a person's ability to perform daily activities #NIMHchats
Rates of concussion are higher in sports like football, rugby, hockey, boxing, wrestling in males, soccer &amp; basketball in females #NIMHchats
The estimated incidence of sports concussions is between 1.6 to 3.8 million annually in the U.S. #NIMHchats
A concussion is caused by a bump, blow, or hit to the head or the body that causes the head &amp; brain to move rapidly back &amp; forth #NIMHchats
Concussion can occur with or without loss of consciousness #NIMHchats
A concussion is a mild brain injury, which results in a short loss of normal brain function. #NIMHchats

What questions do you have so far for our experts? #NIMHchats
Most recover fully from TBI or at least recover enough to continue to function independently throughout most of their life #NIMHchats
Little is known of the impact of TBI on outcomes decades later when the effects of the injury interact with the aging brain #NIMHchats
People with TBI are more likely to report binge drinking, develop epilepsy &amp; have an increased risk of depression and Alzheimer's #NIMHchats
In addition to disability, TBI can lead to increased risk for other health conditions #NIMHchats
. @SafeBeeTweets However, there is no way to completely guarantee avoiding concussion in a contact sport #NIMHchats
. @SafeBeeTweets limiting tackling in practice will reduce the chance of concussion occurring. #NIMHchats

You should work closely with a doctor to learn what works best for a child with DMDD or bipolar disorder    #NIMHchats
Stimulant medication, antidepressant medication like SSRIs, and psychotherapy have all been used to treat DMDD  #NIMHchats
Because the DMDD is a new diagnosis, clinicians are still researching which treatments work best #NIMHchats
Children with DMDD should be treated differently than those with bipolar disorder  #NIMHchats
Combining medication treatment and psychotherapies may help children and adolescents with early-onset bipolar disorder #NIMHchats
There are effective treatments available to help people recover from their episodes and also help prevent future ones #NIMHchats
. @NitaRoha Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) #NIMHchats
. @ALoysiuschOW We think about DMDD as a combo of brain function and enviornment #NIMHchats
. @ALoysiuschOW Mood sx are dramatically different from the indivdual's usual functioning &amp; other syptoms are dramatically worse #NIMHchats
. @Brosvenor Big topic, but the purpose of @NIMH_RDoC is to bring biomarkers and neuroscience to diagnosis. We aren't there yet. #NIMHchats
. @Brosvenor A manic episode defines bipolar disorder. #NIMHchats
. @Brosvenor Depression probably is more common first, but one can't tell unipolar from bipolar based on that. #NIMHchats
Symptoms of DMDD must be present for at least a year  #NIMHchats
Children with DMDD must be at least six years old and symptoms begin before age ten  #NIMHchats
The child's mood between outbursts may be consistently and observably angry or irritable  #NIMHchats
Symptoms of DMDD include sad, irritable or angry moods most of the day, almost every day #NIMHchats
Children with DMDD have severe outbursts at least 3 times a week that interfere with their functioning in more than one setting #NIMHchats
Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) is a new diagnosis that addresses the severe, chronic irritability of these kids #NIMHchats
Kids w/severe irritability differ from those w/BD in how their brains process emotion information &amp; manage attention #NIMHchats
Children with a parent or sibling who has bipolar disorder are up to six times more likely to develop the illness  #NIMHchats
Bipolar disorder tends to run in families, but severe irritability does not  #NIMHchats
Children with severe irritability do not tend to develop manic episodes as they age, while children with bipolar disorder do  #NIMHchats
Severely irritable children differ from those with bipolar disorder in their outcomes, family history, &amp; brain mechanisms #NIMHchats
Research now shows that severe chronic irritability and bipolar disorder are not the same  #NIMHchats
Some children with severe irritability may be diagnosed with bipolar disorder #NIMHchats
. @John_Downey No, the severity of the presentation in childhood does not predict the prognosis. #NIMHchats
. @NitaRoha There isn't any medical tests to make the diagnosis #NIMHchats
. @mentalhealth222 Knowing the symptoms and intervening early can reduce the greatest risks. #NIMHchats
. @mentalhealth222 The greatest risk is from suicide. Generally kids w/BD will go on to have future manic &amp; depressive episodes  #NIMHchats
. @NitaRoha That's always heart breaking. Perhaps reassuring the parent that this may help their child can sometimes work.  #NIMHchats
. @unsuicide There are apps for tracking mood #NIMHchats
. @unsuicide Great point. Kids go to school and when they have bipolar disorder involving the school is helpful to support them. #NIMHchats
. @AzaniaMaitland It's always hard to estimate rates of misdiagnosis or erroneous diagnosis. #NIMHchats
. @Brosvenor There isn't any evidence that the rate of bipolar disorder in kids w/ASD is greater than in the general population #NIMHchats
. @BOBORadioSalish People age 62 can have an episode of mania or depression.  #NIMHchats
. @IntlBipolar Teenage angst is not accompanied by dramatic changes in energy, thinking, or sleep. #NIMHchats
. @IntlBipolar Mania and depression are serious mood disorders with a dramatic change in mood. Angst is not as pervasive #NIMHchats
. @Brosvenor But DMDD is a like a disruptive disorder called oppositional defiant disorder that is more common in boys #NIMHchats
. @Brosvenor Great question bc the rates of bipolar disorder for boys and girls are the same #NIMHchats
. @tinyshahow86 Medication treatments are probably similar, but w/ children &amp; youth, involving the family is usually helpful.  #NIMHchats
. @NitaRoha Someone with a manic episode looks dramatically different from their usual functioning. #NIMHchats
. @NitaRoha Normal ups &amp; downs have a pattern across kids of a certain age &amp; look similar. Symptoms of mania are quite different #NIMHchats

A doctor or health care provider will conduct a careful medical exam to determine whether it is bipolar disorder #NIMHchats
No blood tests or brain scans can diagnose bipolar disorder #NIMHchats
Youth with bipolar disorder have the same symptoms but may present in a different way than adults with mania #NIMHchats
Mania lasts for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 1 week #NIMHchats
Sometimes, a mood episode includes symptoms of both mania and depression #NIMHchats
An extremely sad or irritable time when nothing is really enjoyable for a couple of weeks or more is called a depressive episode #NIMHchats
An overly joyful, elated or irritable state that goes on most of the day, most days is called a manic episode   #NIMHchats
The extreme mood during mania or depression are accompanied by equally changes in energy, activity, sleep, and behavior  #NIMHchats
Each mood episode represents a drastic change from a child’s usual mood and behavior #NIMHchats
Youth with bipolar disorder experience unusually intense emotional states that occur in distinct periods called mood episodes #NIMHchats
Bipolar disorder symptoms develop in teens or early adult years, but abt 50% of ppl w/ it have their first symptoms before age 18 #NIMHchats
. @bacon_r Onset of bipolar II generally is later than bipolar I, but either can onset during late childhood or adolescence #NIMHchats
During an episode of bipolar disorder, day-to-day tasks like going to school or hanging out w/ friends are affected &amp; can be hard #NIMHchats
Symptoms of bipolar disorder can be severe and are different from the normal ups and downs kids experience growing up #NIMHchats
As parents, it may be hard to tell if your child is just going through a “phase” or if they are showing signs of bipolar disorder #NIMHchats
Bipolar disorder is a brain disorder that causes episodes with changes in mood, energy, and activity level #NIMHchats

Therefore, doctors may be less likely to recognize that their patient has depression. #NEIChat
Older adults may have other, less obvious symptoms of depression or they may not be willing to talk about their feelings #NEIChat
