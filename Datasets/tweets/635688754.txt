@paogle @pope_charles6 @bbobllison @stonecold2050 While he is a columnist, I thoroughly enjoy him... I heard him speak ages ago and met him after... he was as darn nice a guy as he appears on tv... and he is a columnist who I think is fair.... I always like to read or hear his opinion...
@paogle @pope_charles6 @bbobllison @stonecold2050 People want entertainment as you noted and like to see the ridiculous... it’s sad...
@paogle @pope_charles6 @bbobllison @stonecold2050 Granted we need to stay informed on what us happening politically, but it is one sided, filled with many opinions and commentaries... the only news they cover anymore are school shootings and hurricanes... the news needs restructuring but it won’t happen...
@paogle @pope_charles6 @bbobllison @stonecold2050 I hate that there is no actual news anymore...,
@paogle @pope_charles6 @bbobllison @stonecold2050 It is very valuable... we have to stay informed to know what we are up against... people do take opinion piece as they truth... and so called news shows that are actually opinion shows... we live in an alternative facts world now... well, some do... I don’t!
@pope_charles6 @paogle @bbobllison @stonecold2050 If there is one good thing about social media, it allows for print media pieces and radio to be shared... tv media is out of control and in my book played a huge role in our current President becoming President with giving him so much free advertising
@audasgrant @elizabethforma @hanksinatra712 I’m watching a show now about an Australian vet... the baby kangaroos are adorable!!
@paogle @pope_charles6 @bbobllison @stonecold2050 Yes... definite difference... I wish more Americans stayed informed... but I don’t think my dream will come true...
@pope_charles6 @paogle @bbobllison @stonecold2050 American news is just politics now... it’s gotten to be too much... unless you put effort into staying informed, the average American has no clue what’s going on around the world...
@realDonaldTrump Instead of posting this, shouldn’t you actually be being President?  I’m sure you’ve got to have work to do...
