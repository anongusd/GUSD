Considering the state of our country and our times, you sir are by far the greatest President we’ve seen in a long while, we are proud to stand next to you. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS 🇺🇸
President @realDonaldTrump made a great move in nominating William Barr to serve as the next #AttorneyGeneral. 🇺🇸
This one to @NewsmaxTV @newsmax 👍 https://t.co/Uw5bb2jzap
The biggest Chinese deal is about to happen under our @POTUS, very exciting.
There is no leadership here in California for the @GOP none, period. We have voter fraud corruption and so much more, and no one is doing anything about it.

It’s so obvious what Twitter is doing by censoring all conservatives and certainly Trump supporters.
The only Russian investigation we should consider looking into is the one with these two individuals in it  @BarackObama @HillaryClinton 👌.
It is so sad to see politically correctness destroying our nation internally, slowly each and everyday.
Big congratulations to our next U.N Ambassador @statedeptspox . 🇺🇸
Merry Christmas month everyone, let’s keep “Making America Great Again!” 🇺🇸
The fake media attacks our @POTUS 24/7 on all fronts for the last two years non stop with malice and only creating false narrative to make sure the people buy it and ultimately change the future of our nation. They are a disgrace to journalism and really to our country.

Mr. @POTUS close the border  and throw away the key.
Never forget that Hillary Clinton left our people to die in Benghazi and never forget that President Obama gave billions to a regime that wants to wipeout &amp; destroy Israel for good.
Why is it so hard for the Democrat party to understand the difference between illegal immigration and legal immigration!!
All Democrats want an open border with no laws or regulations but they live behind walls with security and lots of regulations. 		Why would anyone ever want to vote for the Democratic Party now days? #Insanity
“As Secretary Nielsen said, we will enforce the immigration laws as set forth by Congress and encourage all individuals seeking to enter the U.S. that they do so lawfully. If you break our nation’s immigration laws, we will refer you for prosecution. 	Close the border @POTUS!

For the first time in our country, we have a President that cares more about you, me and our Country than any predecessors before him. All they want to do is sabotage and try to destroy all, for what exactly? Fight like your life is depended on it, because, frankly it is. 🇺🇸
Great Job Champ!! @LewisHamilton
To Liberals &amp; Dems, this must feel like your worst nightmare. Trump keeps attacking and conquering in Mega Ways. And each time he makes them look sillier, stupider and crazier than ever before.

Detroit last elected a Republican mayor in 1957. It is now the model of urban failure -- it’s recognized more for its poverty, crime, rot and bankruptcy than the great cars that it turned out into the early 1970s. It is the poorest big city in the nation. Run by democrats🙃
Chicago hasn't had a Republican mayor in 86 years. The Windy City's current mayor is President Obama's former Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel. Last year was the deadliest year to live in Chicago since 1996. Murders jumped 58% over the previous year to 762. 4,331 shooting victims.

Democrats cry for illegal alien children – encouraged to cross the border by their own parents – but what about the American children who’ve been killed by illegal aliens and permanently separated from their parents?
According to @DHSgo, the number of people attempting to cross the southern border illegally has increased to more than 50,000 people per month. In June, there has been a 325 percent increase in unaccompanied children coming to the border since the previous year.

Clearly,extreme liberal socialist policies have failed in California.	However, i am optimistic, because more and more Californians, regardless of political party or background,are starting to realize how some of these policies actually effect them,......
California’s budget is $137 billion this year,@JerryBrownGov is touting a $9 billion surplus,and yet the state has $200 billion in debt and liabilities-so my question is why are we raising taxes on the working people of this state if we have a $9 billion surplus?
Last year, @JerryBrownGov signed into law a Democrat-backed $52billion,12 cent-per-gallon increase in the state’s excise tax on gasoline, bringing the tax to 41.7 cents per gallon, or a 40% jump.	#VoteRed
