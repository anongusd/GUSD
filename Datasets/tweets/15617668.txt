There are four still photogs getting settled in the Judiciary Cmte room. Usually for these kinds of hearing we'd see about four dozen.
Also of note: there are police stationed at *every single* door and elevator on the second floor of Dirksen. Appears only those with credentials to be here are here.
Worth noting: I've seen none of the usual protest groups in or around Dirksen this morning.
