If this is no longer the Land of the free and home of the brave then let me know. It’s turned into the home of the supremacy and land of the racist. I don’t want part of the “Trump America”. I want the land we promised to be 200 years ago. When we fought for independent living.
It’s “sad, very sad” when EVERYTHING I predicted and said over a year ago are just NOW making it to mainstream news!?!? Am I psychic? A Messiah? Or just an absolute case of America’s intellectual conversation that gets ignored day after day? It’s past time my people... #Enough
New to this in a sense but sometimes #love #faith #honor #truth #transparency #life and just trying to be honest and human are all that we possess. These can be tools for prosperity and a new way of life or hate and be an apostle of the war. Just be the best you that you can be😇
