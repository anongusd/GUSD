TX is #1! For the first time ever, TX is now exporting more oil out of our state than it imports. It should surprise no one that our state continues to top all the right lists. There's no place like TX, and no people as hard working! https://t.co/VHiZnLkVx9
ICE plays a critical role in stopping drug smugglers from delivering their poison to our communities. In the past year, ICE has taken over 2.8M pounds off the streets. Saving lives and stopping drug smugglers. Democrats want to abolish this critical agency. https://t.co/2nvJcbd5Ta

I'm proud to have cosponsored and voted in favor of the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, which lets states hold websites that promote human trafficking accountable for their despicable actions.  https://t.co/u6fMJ9CAbA
Too many American lives have been lost due to the criminal illegal immigrants who commit acts of violence in our communities. I’m pleased to see that ICE under the Trump administration is keeping our cities safe. We must end chain migration. https://t.co/cbRB75zXCj
Rev. Billy Graham impacted millions around the world by spreading the message of Jesus Christ. It was an easy decision to honor this man, who guided so many to Christianity, with a public viewing in the Capitol. https://t.co/nR1izlRpYz

Extremely pleased a federal court has cleared the way for building the border wall that @POTUS has promised. A critical step forward to secure our border, and keep our nation — and our citizens — safe. https://t.co/5RavYZquoW
I’ve joined with my Texas colleagues to demand an investigation as to why the Army Corps of Engineers failed to notify the public about its forecasts that suggested Harvey could cause the Barker and Addicks Reservoirs to flood. https://t.co/x6rWA0nhJw
Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt is a hero who stepped up for our city in its time of need. He raised more than $37 million for Harvey victims, and this honor from the Baylor College of Medicine is much-deserved.  https://t.co/j2OvAACiXo
Due to Obama’s lax immigration policies, our country has been flooded with illegal MS-13 criminals, who are murdering innocents. It is urgent that we protect the U.S. from this gang and work with @POTUS to secure the border. https://t.co/1okT2Fof2M
I recently had a fun chat w/ @TexasTribAbby on a deeply pressing issue: Who gets to claim Alvin, TX' own Nolan Ryan, the Texas @Rangers or the Houston @Astros? (Obviously the Astros, who actually won the World Series!) What do you think?
I’m humbled to receive this support from the National Right to Life in the race for Texas’ 22nd Congressional District. I will always protect and defend the unborn, and my 100% pro-life voting record is clear evidence. https://t.co/isa3tibY8d
ICE has revealed that more than 90% of the illegal immigrants they’ve rounded up have criminal charges. The U.S. must be protected from those who seek to threaten our communities, and I’m glad to see that our laws are being enforced. https://t.co/MyJ2IiTw8h
It was my pleasure to call Eagle Scout Ryan Shaw and inform him of his appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy. As a former Navy pilot, I know such an accomplished young man will excel in our military. Congratulations, Ryan! https://t.co/lnR7SUOmo1
.@bucees opened its doors &amp; provided food and shelter   for the hardworking first responders who saved lives and risked it all during Harvey. This amazing company truly deserves this honor from Katy. Thank you for taking care of our emergency workers!  https://t.co/t9zNX6UX8K
Ending chain migration &amp; the diversity lottery are ways we can reform our immigration system now. These programs have been exploited by terrorists who want to kill Americans. We want citizens who love freedom, not those who actively fight against it. https://t.co/dMLCxaBPb5
Obama's failure to secure our border &amp; crack down on criminal illegal alien gangs like MS-13 was an abject failure. Pleased @POTUS is dedicated to working with local leaders instead of doing nothing to remove these dangerous criminal illegal aliens. https://t.co/L6CggAGb9K
I will always defend and protect life, which is why I proudly voted for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act and the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. It is shocking that so few Democrats supported these bills. https://t.co/O3jYM1ghFs
In Dec, the House sent the Senate an $81 billion disaster package for aid for #Harvey victims. Many Texans still desperately need help &amp; the Senate still has not acted. That’s why I led an effort w/my TX House colleagues to push the Senate to do their job. https://t.co/e6F9jMDOzH
Thanks to GOP efforts in the House and @POTUS leadership, under the #TaxCutsandJobsAct we have a booming U.S. economy for the first time in years. Our priorities are w/our economy, our people, our safety, &amp; our security! https://t.co/0bLEPWs2Xf
My entire life, I’ve been pro-life, which is why I’ve introduced the Taxpayer Conscience Protection Act. This legislation requires children born alive during abortion to be treated like any other birth, with the intent of protecting its life. https://t.co/ArhKNsxWpf
It was great seeing @POTUS recognize Jon Bridgers, the founder of the Cajun Navy which saved so many lives during Harvey, during his State of the Union last night. With his remarks in mind, we must continue the focus on our nation’s economic growth.  https://t.co/MxWo3cUKn8
I'm thankful for so many escaping injury in today's accident. My thoughts and prayers are with those who were injured and for the family of the person who lost their life.
Less regulation, lower taxes, a stronger economy -- and we're just getting started! I'm looking forward to @POTUS’s #SOTU address tonight, and putting together a plan for another strong year to come. https://t.co/ie7cBjeD1c
Rather than help victims of Harvey, Schumer and his coterie of leftists are coming to Houston this weekend to fundraise, a deep insult to our city. The GOP is fighting to get funds to help those who need it! https://t.co/cwhM90DSD6
I’m looking forward to hosting Gulf War veteran Curtis Brown at the National Prayer Breakfast next month. Curtis is not only helping our veterans deal with PTSD, but he’s also assisting service members with opioid addiction. He’s a true American hero. https://t.co/Jmi3H9KfaM
I’ve invited Needville resident Katie Vacek to attend @POTUS’s State of the Union speech with me next week. Katie was paralyzed after a tree climbing accident, but she has shown all of us what is possible when you have courage, resilience, and faith. https://t.co/jiD6eihbNZ
After the Democrats’ pointless #SchumerShutdown, even leftists think Chuck is a sellout. @SenSchumer's attempt to save face won't prevent a wall from being built. My colleagues and I are proud to stand with @POTUS in securing our border.  https://t.co/LeWmrTzDYG
Pleased Sen Dems finally saw reason and agreed to reopen our government, end the #SchumerShutdown &amp; provide CHIP for kids who need it. It’s past time to serve our military &amp; kids before illegal immigrants! https://t.co/p1jCQBanOl
The House has done our job, Dems in the Senate must step up! https://t.co/l15PCvmb9k
Yesterday, the House acted to keep the govt open, &amp; extend the CHIP kids health program for 6 years! Yet Sen Dems are prepared to block military pay &amp; healthcare for kids by voting to shut down our govt! Tell them to stop the #SchumerShutdown
Congratulations to Catherine Engelbrecht &amp; @truethevote for receiving a @TheJusticeDept settlement for the harassment and targeting they endured under Obama's IRS. They stood their ground, and fought against the "weaponization" of Obama's bureaucracy. https://t.co/T46mkZaeHp

In September, I called for a better emergency alert system for when disasters like #Harvey affect us. The @FCC is now considering upgrades to improve geo-targeting, which should save lives. https://t.co/doqwQz79UV
Construction companies are bidding on options for @POTUS’s border wall, to protect our communities from criminal illegal immigrants. We must defend our border &amp; enforce our immigration laws to protect our families and loved ones. https://t.co/jkgRXeIZVI
As a veteran, I recognize the impact PTSD has on our Veterans. Veterans account for 18% of suicides. Often, the first year home is the most difficult. @POTUS's EO ensuring our veterans get the access to potentially life saving care is the reform we need. https://t.co/WkwiFNCgQl

Obama’s open border policies brought crime &amp; violence to our nation. While we work w/@POTUS to capture &amp; deport criminal aliens, CA insists on being a Sanctuary State.  Like these signs say, if you’re a criminal alien, feel free to move to CA &amp; leave TX! https://t.co/9E94iUt6am
On this day in 1845 TX officially joined the USA and our nation has been stronger ever since.  Celebrate the history of our Lone Star heritage and learn a little bit more about what continues to make Texas the greatest state in the union. https://t.co/eALdXceZt0

Democrats complained that #taxreform wouldn’t work, and that it would harm individuals and families. Once again, they are proven wrong. Bigger paychecks and lower taxes are on their way! https://t.co/zeSKYGBySN
The time is now! Today, the House passed tax reform for the middle class. At last, Texans will have a simplified tax code that will result in economic strength, a country that can compete internationally, and a larger paycheck! https://t.co/BjtBZLpEWq
Not only did the Obama Admin put guns into the hands of drug cartels, they ignored a DEA investigation showing Hezbollah &amp; Iran were trafficking drugs into America. Undermining our nation’s security in favor of political expedience. https://t.co/Gh8jemTI9F
