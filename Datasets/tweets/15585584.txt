My #RareDiseaseDay request is for you is to consider people like me and my daughter when you vote. Don't vote for Republicans who are trying to make healthcare less accessible for people with rare diseases and more expensive for people with pre-existing conditions.
My daughter and I are currently treated with very expensive drugs, administered by painful injections 3x a week. If our pre-existing conditions were to no longer be covered by insurance, we would simply not be able to afford to pay for the (only) medication that treats HPP.
It's #RareDiseaseDay I have a very painful ultra-rare genetic disorder. I'm thankful for @RareDiseases for their support for me and my daughter, who also has hypophosphatasia. We have also received wonderful care from @UMNHealth https://t.co/Cw3dCK0KUA

@williamfleitch when did the Cubs retaliate today after Rizzo was plunked? Was it the 1st time or the 2nd time?
@williamfleitch FWIW Rizzo's been plunked 10+ more times than anyone else. I can't think of a single retaliation this year.
@williamfleitch I'd say certain teams/managers/pitchers are far more likely than others which is what I hate about it.
@williamfleitch do you think all teams do it with equal frequency? All are equally prone to retaliate in every situation?
