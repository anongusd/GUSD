@FOIAFile @MuckRock Federal. I don't think it's a technological issue as much as it is a disagreement over what is "reasonably segregable." They seem to be arguing that the records won't be understandable without the redacted info. I'd like to be the judge of that. (I can still aggregate.)
@dataeditor If you were to call the agency's press office and asked if the same agency was using CSVs to manipulate records, they would think you were a kook.
Oh, and I think I might have buried the lede: This is data that Congress has required the agency to post publicly on its web site.
@resentfultweet The underlying issue is (b)(4), that some fields in the database could identify a specific company. Perhaps anticipating my argument that they could simply redact those fields, agency argues that the raw, redacted data would then be "misconstrued."
I'm also flabbergasted by the idea that releasing the exact records I sought would "not accurately capture what the requester is seeking."
Hey fellow #FOIA requesters: Anyone have any thoughts on how to appeal a denial because the records "can be misconstrued?" It seems so ridiculous I don't know that it's ever been litigated. https://t.co/ZtkkQBJxXL
3/ Agency 3 released a database (in PDF form), redacted it (mostly exemption (b)(4)), and the last entry in the database is from February 13, 2018.
2/ Agency 2 says raw data can't be released because "it can be misconstrued and not accurately capture what the requester is seeking."
1/ I'm catching up on some FOIA appeals today for #FOIAFriday, Here's some of what I'm dealing with:		Agency 1 says comments from the public are "inter- and intra-agency memos" and releasing them "may bias the input received" in the future.

@PessimisticPhD @michaelkruse It doesn't, which is part of the problem.

9/ Epilogue: In 2016, President Obama pardoned a bunch of Iranians accused of similar crimes as a "side deal" to the Iran nuclear agreement. Nazemzadeh wasn't one of them. But the Justice Department dismissed the charges months later without explanation.
@140xLangame @fuglydug Correct. National emergencies have to be renewed every year, but presidents have done so routinely. That's why there are 31 national emergencies currently in effect. (And once President Trump sends his border wall emergency to Congress, it will be 32.)
8/ "If you look at the history ... it was to give the president extra powers in times of emergency. It wasn't intended to permanently expand the powers of the executive branch. It's all on fairly shaky ground," Clif Burns, a Washington sanctions lawyer, told me then.
7/ I wrote about the Nazemzadeh case in 2014. Even then, people were questioning whether the National Emergencies Act was giving the president too much unchecked power for too long. https://t.co/V6aETTjM9A
6/ The judge disagreed. Judge James Lorenz (a Clinton nominee) ruled that Congress's action "complemented" the president's emergency powers, but didn't take them away. https://t.co/umcldQMYh7
5/ Nazemzadeh's lawyer moved to dismiss the charges. She argued that the president can't use emergency powers to enforce a law where Congress has explicitly provided an exception.
4/ But the year before, Congress passed the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability and Divestment Act of 2010. Among other things, that law explicitly excluded medical devices from Iran sanctions. https://t.co/chHchfD5U9
3/ He shipped a refurbished MRI coil to a hospital in Iran. He didn't have a license. There was no argument that the MRI coil was dual-use technology that could have military applications -- just that he didn't have a license.
2/ Nazemzadeh was accused of violating Executive Order 12957, which imposed sanctions on Iran under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. That executive order required a license to ship medical equipment to Iran.

@digiphile @opengov @Weichert45 @TheJusticeDept @OMBPress @FOIAPost @MuckRock That's ... disappointing.
@digiphile @opengov @Weichert45 @TheJusticeDept @OMBPress @FOIAPost I've been hostile to the use of FOIA portals from the beginning, for a variety of reasons. So I only file by U.S. mail if an agency doesn't allow email requests. But if I can use the API to manage my requests and keep my own records, that could be a game changer.
@baseballot This is my goal, too, but I have some catching up to do. I've been to maybe three presidential gravesites and eight current/five defunct ballparks.
@opengov @Weichert45 @TheJusticeDept @OMBPress How did I not know that https://t.co/sHm27YCiV1 had a publicly available API? I might have to change my opinion on this whole enterprise.

9/ So the post-hurricane Bush proclamations *were* national emergencies, meaning there have been 60 since 1976, not 58. 		Thanks to eagle-eyed @svdate for raising the question. Here's his story explaining the implications for the power of the purse: https://t.co/beMFrbePOx
8/ Here's my story on the OLC opinion from 2016. (It raised a lot of eyebrows because the Obama Justice Department decided to release it just a month before Trump took office.) https://t.co/ReReNbS0Il
7/ Second, the Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion on this in 2016. It's a bit dense, but the bottom line is that the National Emergencies Act applies whether the president formally declares it or not. (And OLC explicitly cited Davis-Bacon as an example.) https://t.co/jmiJ0xhQLh
6/ He followed that up with a presidential memorandum directing Secretary of Labor @SecElaineChao to comply with the reporting requirements of the National Emergencies Act. https://t.co/5I1SPRxYYJ
5/ So did he declare a national emergency, or just observe that one existed? I think they're the same thing, and here's why. 		First, Bush himself acknowledged that the National Emergencies Act applied to the Katrina emergency when he terminated it: https://t.co/QzDTElPysf
4/ This is the emergency I wrote about in my story. In his proclamation, Bush said, "I find that the conditions caused by Hurricane Katrina constitute a ‘national emergency’ within the meaning of section 3147 of title 40, United States Code.” That's Davis-Bacon, not the NEA.
3/ But there are at least two times the president recognized a national emergency without citing the NEA. One was George H.W. Bush after Hurricane Andrew. The second was George W. Bush, who suspended Davis-Bacon by proclamation in 2005. https://t.co/SumK9Lamnp
2/ The difference is in our definition of what counts as an "officially declared" national emergency. The Brennan Center only counted executive orders and proclamations in which the president explicitly cited the National Emergencies Act. Their list: https://t.co/0uj7EqhnW6
1/ My story last week about the one time Congress threatened to revoke a presidential emergency noted that there have been 60 emergencies since 1976. 		The @BrennanCenter says there were 58. We're both right, but I thought I'd explain and show my receipts. https://t.co/VDB4skoOxB

@mtdukes This is exactly what they were trying to do. I was bored and decided to play along up until the point where I got into unfamiliar territory. I asked him to explain what we were doing, he got impatient, and I asked if I should call my corporate IT department. Then he hung up.

Like VA, 23 states and territories have attorney general in line of succession, and 36 have speaker of the House. If it goes to the speaker in VA, the governor would flip parties. 		Most states allow that, but CO allows legislative leaders to rise only if they're in same party.
In five states and the District of Columbia, the constitutional line of succession is only two deep: Just a Gov and Lt. Gov. (Or in D.C., Council President).		In two states, the line is 12 people long -- down to the Commissioner of Insurance in N.Y. and Secretary of State in N.C.

@JessicaHuseman It's also unconstitutional.		"The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected...."

@aweiss I've filed many a FOIA request on a weekend or holiday, and it was deemed received the next business day or whenever they opened the mail. That seemed fair, and the time delta was insignificant. But now the shutdown, that's an issue.
@aweiss I agree, but this whole exercise has caused me to reconsider what "filing" a FOIA request even means, and when that moment happens. Is it when it's sent? Postmarked? Received? Accepted? Acknowledged?

@pnrodenbush I think there’s good reason to be skeptical. I’m not convinced it’s completely untrue, but now the burden is on BuzzFeed to prove it.

@tom_steely I don’t have a parsing machine and I’m not trying to sell you one. All I have is instincts honed over two decades of experience, and they’re telling me I don’t have enough information to make heads or tails. Your mileage may vary.
But I’ve also seen instances where the subject of the story just doesn’t like the story. They’re mad it got out. Or they’re quibbling over word choices. To me, Mueller’s protest of the “description” or “characterization” of evidence makes me wonder if that’s what’s going on here.
BuzzFeed has an obligation to get the story right. Not partly right. Not mostly right. Completely right. Their use of anonymous sources only heightens that obligation.
It would be wise to withhold judgment on both the BuzzFeed story and Mueller’s denial of it. The story relies on anonymous sources and can’t be confirmed by other outlets. But also, the vague denial makes it impossible to know whether Mueller is disputing all of it or just part.

@jfritze But if the emergency is the "humanitarian crisis" he outlined yesterday, he'd need a new emergency declaration, because the emergency powers are limited to the purpose of the emergency he declares.
@jfritze So if the purpose of the emergency power is to prevent terrorist threats -- a case the president seems to be trying to make -- he would not need to declare a new emergency.
@jfritze That executive order expanded the powers of Proclamation 7463, which declared an emergency "by reason of the terrorist attacks at the World Trade Center, New York, New York, and the Pentagon, and the continuing	and immediate threat of further attacks on the United States."
There is, of course, a constitutional mechanism for the president to send laws back to Congress if he thinks they're unconstitutional, unworkable, or unwise.		It's called the veto.
He concluded the signing statement by saying he thought cold cases were important. He just didn't want to follow this particular law -- nor does he want to spend money on it. https://t.co/hACUScFYqW
Here's an example yesterday: Trump signed the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Collection Act of 2018, sponsored by @SenDougJones. He then challenged:		Section 3(f)	Section 4 	Section 5(b)	Section 5(f)	Section 5(i)		(Section 1 was the title and Section 2 was definitions.)
And he's doing this even after having elaborate bill-signing ceremonies in which he praises the bills -- even as he says he has no intention of carrying out certain provisions the way Congress intended.
I commend @MiamiUProf's entire thread to your attention, but the takeaway here is that Trump is packing more constitutional challenges into his signing statements than his predecessors -- a practice that received widespread condemnation during the Bush years.
DATA: President Trump has used signing statements to make more challenges to laws he signed than any other modern president -- even more than President George W. Bush in his first two years, according to @MiamiUProf, who tracks these.		And this doesn't count six more on Tuesday. https://t.co/1E1Jax1ybM

@ChrisEdelson I re-read some of the legislative history of the National Emergencies Act over the weekend, and what struck me is that Congress explicitly refused to recognize the concept of emergency power inherent in the executive. If it's inherent, he doesn't need an emergency.

Short version: It's a trap.
Trump's original statements on Syria:		"We have defeated ISIS in Syria."	"Time to come home and rebuild."	"It's time to get our soldiers out, and it's time to get our young people out." https://t.co/hXBeIYsD1T
Trump signs this bill in a heartbeat, then issues a signing statement citing unitary executive power under Article II, and puts his big, beautiful wall wherever he wants. https://t.co/mvaneg7mgL
@stompk This is only one of about 30 different national emergencies currently in effect. A border emergency would require a new proclamation or executive, because each declaration of emergency must specifically cite the emergency powers to be used -- and these are new powers.
More than two months later, what came wasn't a presidential declaration of a national emergency, but a much narrower public health emergency. 		So there's a difference between Trump's sweeping emergency rhetoric and the actual powers he'll invoke, which may be more limited. (3/3)
In 2017, I asked Trump whether opioids were an emergency. "The opioid crisis is an emergency, and I’m saying officially right now:  It is an emergency.  It's a national emergency." (2/3) https://t.co/86C1ahTuh9
As Trump considers invoking emergency powers to build a wall, it's worth remembering how he made similar promises of a national emergency for the opioid crisis. (1/3)
@brendono Maybe he should finish Johnson first.
So the question will be: Which current military construction projects does Trump believe are "not essential to the national defense?" How much money can he scrimp from them, and which congressional districts are they in? And why are they paying for the wall instead of Mexico?
This statute, which @LizaGoitein alerted me to, might be the most on point. It allows the Defense Secretary to cancel or defer other military construction projects and move the money to a new project during a national emergency. https://t.co/8kFyJhjLiO
@MagentaRocks @BradMossEsq @bradheath (2) An emergency is anything the president says it is. By their nature, emergencies are events you can't always define or plan for until they happen. But emergency powers are very specific, and they're defined by Congress.
@MagentaRocks @BradMossEsq @bradheath (1) He can declare it on his own unilaterally -- that's the nature of an emergency. There's supposed to be oversight, but Congress has hasn't done any meaningful check on emergency powers in four decades. It's supposed to review each emergency every six months, but never has.
@BradMossEsq @bradheath The National Emergencies Act is my jam.
@bradheath You should thank @LizaGoitein, who's cataloged every single presidential emergency power here: https://t.co/6E34hXCJEi
And here's another provision that allows the Defense Department to take control of lands during a national emergency. But it applies only to *public* lands, so it's not really eminent domain: https://t.co/BBnBAxHBPp
@bradheath And here's one that waives certain procedural requirements for the Defense Department to acquire land during a national emergency without consulting Congress: https://t.co/pJhqF9ssWG
@bradheath He may be referring to a couple of different provisions. Here's one that allows the Defense Department to take control of other *public* lands during a national emergency: https://t.co/BBnBAxHBPp
But one thing a national emergency can't do is spend money that hasn't been appropriated by Congress. So all Trump can do is speed up the planning for a wall he still doesn't have the money to build.
Trump appears to be talking about this provision, which waives certain procedural requirements for the Defense Department to acquire land during a national emergency: https://t.co/pJhqF9ssWG

@BennettJohnT Need I remind you of the carnage caused by the last shutdown?https://t.co/lkbVRK2auh
@MarkSZaidEsq The question posed there was how the shutdown affected FOIA for reporting purposes: i.e., compiling response time statistics in the annual report. But it’s a good reminder that FOIA is not suspended during a shutdown.
@aggrizzly The FOIA provides for an administrative appeal -- in this case, to Interior's Office of the Solicitor (who is exempt from shutdown).
Email from a House Democratic staffer, after recounting a flurry of legislative activity: 		"I’m here if you have any questions! It’s good to be in the majority."
(4) While I didn't request expedited processing here, the law does allow it where there's a "compelling need" as defined by statute. That compelling need could trigger an exception to the Anti-Deficiency Act.	(5) It's the law. They're public records. I don't need a reason.
(1) Just because they're not working doesn't mean I'm not. I often make requests far in advance of when I plan to write.	(2) Not all of the agency is furloughed. Some are on continuing appropriations.	(3) Submitting it now reserves my place for first-in, first-out processing. https://t.co/tLUrjni57F
@juliehdavis Oh, absolutely. I see this as more a statement about how the House and Senate are two distinct cities. You can't get there from here.
In other words, the FOIA clock does not stop during a shutdown. To be fair, an agency can certainly claim extenuating circumstances for an extension beyond 20 days. But there are very real rights they're depriving by not even *accepting* a request.
Memo from DOJ, 2013: "As a matter of policy ... and consistent with the spirit of openness in administering the FOIA, agencies should count as part of their response times for FOIA requests and appeals the eleven days when the government was closed." https://t.co/ulvvwpBlvk

Which celebrity obituary deserves top billing today?
Bush 41: "U.S. support for the Afghan people and the subsequent Soviet military withdrawal from Afghanistan constitute a powerful example of what we Americans can accomplish when Executive and Congress, Republican and Democrat, stand together."
Reagan: "The United States, along with the vast majority of nations, has condemned and remains opposed to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.... We will react strongly to acts of aggression wherever they take place. There will never be a weakening of this resolve."
Carter: "Such gross interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan is in blatant violation of accepted international rules of behavior.... The Soviet action is a major matter of concern to the entire international community."
Truman: "In Asia, in a vast area stretching from Afghanistan to Korea, free countries are struggling to meet communist aggression... Some of these countries are battling the communist armies of Soviet satellites... all of them face the immediate danger of communist subversion." https://t.co/0iSCnbNPjT

... Sean was a bit sheepish, saying it was his first week and the room was crowded and he didn't see her and no insult was intended but he would try to call on her from then on. April noted that she was in the third row center, right in his line of sight....
... but April had already cornered him in the hallway to Upper Press. I watched her buttonhole him for at least 10 minutes about how she had been in the press corps a long time, represented a sizable audience, and expected to get her questions answered....

Another sign that the White House is prepared for a constitutional challenge: The proclamation has a 1,300-word preamble explaining why Trump is suspending asylum. The White House started writing those long justifications after the first two travel bans were overturned.
Here's my story from last year about how severability clauses work in executive orders and what Trump's legal strategy is:  https://t.co/Kz0gAwnwad
Severability clauses are routine in contracts and legislation but relatively new in presidential orders. Trump has now used them 11 times, by my count -- more than Obama did his entire presidency.
President Trump's proclamation on asylum contains a severability clause -- two clauses, in fact. It's a sign that White House lawyers expect it to be challenged in court and don't want the whole proclamation struck down if one part is ruled unconstitutional. https://t.co/3gPwU04ie8

So does @acosta have constitutional grounds to challenge the revocation of credentials? We’re in uncharted territory.
There are Secret Service regulations that allow for an appeal of any “hard pass” denial or revocation. But those regs are for credentials denied for security reasons. It appears these were revoked by the press office.
This is unacceptable. https://t.co/4sq47RapEz

So the follow-up questions to the president should be: "What is the last year for which your returns are not under audit, and will you release those returns? What effective tax rate did you pay? How many charitable contibutions did you make,m and to whom? Do you pay the AMT?"
President Trump just said (again) that he won't voluntarily release his tax returns because they're still under audit. But if that's the standard, no president would ever release his returns because the president's taxes are *automatically* audited. https://t.co/CGVyEbW3Wa
@rlocker12 Minnesota had a special election, so it's also effectively double-counted. And of course a third of the states had no Senate race at all.

@jeffreynye I was in the middle of writing this story for the Cincinnati Enquirer when I moved to USA TODAY. I wanted to write it for the 100th anniversary but then I got busy.
@JaredRizzi @jeffreynye They didn't need to. Vote-buying was so accepted and flagrant that there would be representatives from each campaign in the polling place. You'd just show them your ballot and they would pay you.
@jeffreynye It’s the legacy of the Adams County vote buying scandal of 1911. The technology is different but the principle is the same: if you can prove who you voted for, it’s easier to sell your vote.

Osler and @RachelBarkow began the 90-minute meeting by talking about what's broken with the current clemency system: It's bureaucratic, opaque, and has a built in conflict of interest with the Justice Department making recommendations on cases it prosecuted.
Also, she wasn't on the list of participants released by the White House, but @IvankaTrump attended the entire meeting. In keeping with her focus on workforce development, she steered the discussion to what happens to clemency recipients after they're released from prison.
Senior White House official: “I would not be surprised if Kim finds her way back to the White House in the not-too-distant future."
“It was a serious, engaged discussion of the clemency process involving people from very different perspectives. I am encouraged about real work being done to fix something that is broken and important," says @Oslerguy.

@prowag @jenningsjt @shannimcg @LawrenceRegina I think that's right. Here's a visualization we did at @USATODAY last year showing how President Trump was so often "off message:" https://t.co/ti98JfFWzw
@jenningsjt @prowag @shannimcg @LawrenceRegina One difference: President Obama's tweets were "written in the president's voice." President Trump's are, we're told, written by the president himself. Obama's tweets were also more likely to simply be restatements of things he'd already said.

@waltshaub @ovp That's why I thought it was fair to say he "works for" the VP's office, even if I can't be sure about the exact details of the employment arrangement.

@pencilskirt @emptywheel The pardon power is in the absolute discretion of the president, so he can pardon – or not pardon – anyone he wants. There's no legal argument about unequal protection of the law. Take the case of two co-conspirator brothers: https://t.co/ChobLIXUJG
@jbenton Oh, gotcha. Also, if I recall correctly, the indictment said that it was a congressional candidate – and did not say whether that candidate was elected. (Which would be a threshold issue for the ethics committee but not the broader oversight role.)
@jbenton Did I miss something?
Anyway, that's the epilogue. For background on the case and why Trump granted the pardons (and commutations), here's the story I wrote at the time last month: https://t.co/utH71VlLDf
Also, the Hammonds' lawyer suggested to me that because it's unheard of for someone in prison to receive a pardon, the warden wouldn't know what to do with a pardon warrant. A commutation warrant would ensure no confusion by the Bureau of Prisons about what to do.
But here are two guesses: (1) The Hammonds applied only for a commutation, because DOJ regulations ( 28 C.F.R. §§ 1.1) say you have to be out of prison for five years to apply for a pardon. Trump wanted to pardon them to make a statement, but also commuted to close out the case.
So far as I can tell, this is the first time in history that this has happened. So why did Trump do it this way? The Justice Department won't say.
There's no reason to give a pardon and commutation simultaneously, because a pardon is the highest form of presidential clemency and automatically commutes any sentence.
It's possible to get both a pardon and a commutation, but they usually happen years apart. Patty Hearst is one famous example: President Carter commuted her sentence for bank robbery, and President Clinton later gave her a full pardon.
I went back and looked at the clemency that President Trump granted to Dwight and Steven Hammond last month and discovered something really unusual: They were given both pardons and commutations on the same day. https://t.co/Eg3v2Z7SSK

@jadler1969 And it’s preposterous to argue that Trump has levied war against the U.S., so now we’re back to aid and comfort. So is Russia an enemy? There’s no declared war. And Trump is the c-in-c.
@jadler1969 @slainte39 That’s why I’m excluding the impeachment question, because I agree with Gerald Ford’s definition of “high crimes and misdemeanors.”
@slainte39 @jadler1969 Yeah, I thought if anything my tone would be interpreted as skeptical of Brennan’s use of the term.
@jadler1969 Why not? Certainly a press conference is an overt act, and there were at least two witnesses to it. So what is the definition of “aid and comfort,” and who decides who an “enemy” is?

Small footnote to Kennedy retirement: Like other justices before him, he's retiring from the Supreme Court but not from the bench. He has elected to take "senior status," which requires him to hear a small number of appeals cases and allow him to keep his $251,800 salary.

@guan @bradheath @big_cases The government just recaptioned it Flores v. Sessions. https://t.co/iu8Jp8aENq
Hey, @big_cases, are you following Flores v. Reno, 2:1985cv04544, in the Central District of California? If not, you should ask @bradheath.
@jaytbones @rudalev Yes, but it also makes it unclear what the practical effect of this EO is — and allows the president to sign EOs for rhetorical value that may or may not have any tangible effect.
@alahav @jacklgoldsmith @AJosephOConnell @steve_vladeck This language originally appeared in EO 12291, which was the Reagan order requiring a cost-benefit analysis on regulations. It came out of a growing concern in the executive branch that litigants were using their own internal guidance against them in court. Now it's boilerplate.
Here's a clue that the executive order was slapped together and posted on short notice: The White House misspelled "seperation" in the heading. https://t.co/R00q5wMUii https://t.co/JABvXeJ9ha
And as presidential scholar @rudalev points out, this order also contains the weasel words "to the extent permitted by law" in three different places. That's a clue to keep an eye on how the order is actually enforced, because it gives DHS an out. https://t.co/l0NagtWMv8
This part of Trump's executive order is boilerplate, but it's important: Basically, you can't sue the administration for failing to enforce the executive order. If families are separated in the future, this order does not create a private right of action in and of itself. https://t.co/2ezLa44o1Q
But Trump's executive order explicitly does not overturn Attorney General Sessions' "zero tolerance policy." Immigrant families seeking asylum will continue to be criminally prosecuted unless they request asylum at times and places designated by the government. https://t.co/NfhWOjaEC2
Trump is also asking for a court to sign off on his new policy, changing a 20-year-old consent decree to allow children to be imprisoned with their parents. https://t.co/KWjPxcnNYs
Trump's executive order on family separations instructs the Defense Department to make military bases available to house immigrant families — or to build more facilities to house them if necessary. https://t.co/RXAcn1p4J7
Here's one thing we've learned from the 126 executive orders and presidential memoranda that President Trump has signed so far: It's dangerous to characterize what the order says until we see the actual text.
Previous presidents used the goodwill created by the bipartisan picnic as a way get momentum toward compromise legislation. Trump thinks it's somehow better to dis-invite members and their families — many of whom have already traveled to Washington at their expense to attend.
President Trump says he's postponing tomorrow's congressional picnic at the White House because of family immigration crisis. 		"It doesn’t feel right to have a picnic for Congress, when we’re working on doing something very important," he says.
President Trump says he will sign an order — unclear what form, content, or scope — to keep families crossing the border together. 		"I’ll be doing something that’s somewhat preemptive and ultimately will be matched by legislation I’m sure," he says.
@SteveKoff @jcarrsmyth It’s not inconceivable that Suarez could receive a pardon. He did essentially the same thing Dinesh D’Souza did.
@LucRiesbeck @joshledermanAP It seems to have been fixed in the story, so it’s just a matter of re-caching the Twitter metadata.
@joshledermanAP Seems to be a problem with the Twitter headline.
@liebermans @CharterCommitte @ChrisCinciBiz Should the charter then also align with state rules on competitive bidding, campaign finance and inside millage? I just think the argument that statutory cities do it is a weak — and un-Charterite — sort of argument.
@liebermans @CharterCommitte @ChrisCinciBiz No, the charter never allowed executive sessions. "The proceedings of council shall be public." The fact that City Council routinely violated the charter didn't nullify its provisions.
@liebermans @CharterCommitte @ChrisCinciBiz But the whole purpose of the charter is to allow the citizens of Cincinnati to decide these issues for themselves — as they did in 1925 — and not have Columbus decide for them. If you want to align city government with the Ohio revised code, why not be a statutory city?
@CharterCommitte @ChrisCinciBiz This is an odd stance for the Charter Committee to take, seeing as executive sessions explicitly violate the city charter.
DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defends policy of separating parents and children in a White House briefing: "We will enforce every law on the books to protect the sovereignty and security of the United States."

@MiamiUProf Hey, if it were up to me it would still be "Gerrymander" with a hard capital "G."
@MiamiUProf It's interesting that even today's SCOTUS decision adopts that terminology: 39 references to "partisan gerrymander" and — in Kagan concurrence — an "extreme partisan gerrymanders."
@BenFischerSBJ Yeah, I can see how it's viewed as an ethnocentric rooting interest, but for those of us whose primary exposure to soccer is the Premier League it's a logical choice. For me, there are three Spurs players in the England starting IX.
@MiamiUProf For "extreme partisan gerrymandering," the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette quoted a report from the Republican state committee in 1883, claiming that the GOP legislature's redistricting bill was "the most liberal ever presented" to the minority party: https://t.co/WC4NPZbxt5
@MiamiUProf First reference I could find to "partizan gerrymandering" was in an 1850 Detroit Free Press editorial advocating changes to the state constitution: https://t.co/ZkBIP1TVPE
@GrantWahl @JohnStrong My German friend didn’t get the reference and still thought it was a brilliant call. Then I explained the reference and he laughed even harder.

@alexkasprak It’s not a committee, which again suggests he doesn’t know how the clemency process has worked.
@mwaresh1 @maggieNYT I don't know. That's why I'm asking.
@johnbycz Sentence commuted by Carter, pardoned by Clinton. There are a number of those kinds of cases. But you don't need two pardons if the first was full and unconditional.
DOJ spokeswoman confirms to me that there is no such "committee" at the Department of Justice, so if it exists it's in the Executive Office of the President. Maybe Trump misspoke or was using inexact language to refer to the process — or else he doesn't know what that process is.
@CrisAlvaradoMD @USATODAY @POTUS @krauthammer I knew the story. https://t.co/bxAQSp5sLB
I missed this initially in President Trump's remarks on pardons this morning. He says requests for pardons and commutations will go to "my committee" to decide. There is no such existing committee. Did he just create one? https://t.co/wR26HOidiT
@CrisAlvaradoMD @USATODAY @POTUS I wrote four stories about the Jack Johnson pardon. I get the symbolism of correcting a historic wrong, and the use of presidential soft power to do that. But it's worth pointing out that Ali would be in an entirely separate category even from Johnson.
@CleMetroBar Uh, oh. I guess I better start cramming.
@CrisAlvaradoMD @USATODAY @POTUS I don't see anything divisive about this. But to use your analogy, a pardon for Ali would be more like curing smallpox than curing cancer. It was already cured.
@djaccity @USATODAY (1) There's nothing to pardon. Ali's conviction was null and void. (2) President Carter pardoned all Vietnam-era draft evaders in 1977, so Ali would have gotten a pardon then if he needed it, and (3) All of this is in the story.
It's possible that someone could have been pardoned specifically and then generally, but never the other way around. There have also been pardons with multiple warrants issued, and of course a less-than-full pardon (i.e., a commutation) can later turn into a full pardon. https://t.co/Z0YPemOfla
A pardon for Ali would be purely symbolic, even for a posthumous pardon. His conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1971, and President Carter already pardoned draft evaders in 1977. https://t.co/RqkUDFbjKh via @usatoday
President Trump is now considering redundant pardons. Muhammad Ali would already have been pardoned under President Carter's general amnesty for draft dodgers under Proclamation 4483. https://t.co/krpRqOFyIy

Sources tell me the White House reached out to clemency advocates last week to get names of others who may be deserving of clemency like Alice Marie Johnson. Trump is now considering shortening the sentences for as many as 50 prisoners, mostly drug offenders.
Kim Kardashian West was the one to tell Alice Marie Johnson that President Trump had commuted her sentence, her lawyer @theshawnholley says. It was "a wonderful, emotional and amazing phone call," she said.
We haven't seen the clemency warrant yet, so we don't know the terms of Alice Marie Johnson's release. Trump's only previous commutation, for Sholom Rubashkin, ordered his immediate release (a departure from Obama's practice) but kept five years of court supervision.

@JimmyMcSavage It’s the exact same problem. The Crossland banner was the flag of pro-Confederate Marylanders during the Civil War. During Reconstruction it was incorporated back into the Calvert banner, giving us the modern design.
Besides the fact that it’s set to the tune of “O! Tannenbaum” — which is criminal enough — Maryland’s state song is a Confederate battle cry that advocates the assassination of President Lincoln. And they still sing it every year at the Preakness Stakes.

Office of Government Ethics note: "OGE has concluded that the information related to the payment made by Mr. Cohen is required to be reported and that the	information provided meets the disclosure requirement for a reportable liability."
"... Mr. Cohen sought reimbursement of those expenses and Mr. Trump fully reimbursed Mr. Cohen in 2017. The category of value would be $100,001 - $250,000 and the interest rate would be zero."
Footnote reads: "In the interest of transparency, while not required to be disclosed as 'reportable liabilities' on Part 8, in 2016 expenses were incurred by one of Donald J. Trump's attorneys, Michael Cohen. ...
In footnote to new financial disclosure filing, President Trump says he reimbursed his attorney Michael Cohen $100,001 to $250,000 for expenses in 2016. These would presumably include the payment to Stormy Daniels as part of the non-disclosure agreement.

@AndyMcCanse @emptywheel @wrdcsc Which is why these kinds of debates are often more about posturing than the law, because neither side actually wants to force a constitutional crisis. Except for maybe Nixon and Clinton. And Trump.
@AndyMcCanse @emptywheel @wrdcsc Did I miss (4)? Also, Eric Posner made the same point to me recently — that courts are more likely to overturn presidents when they're politically unpopular. I wonder if there's empirical evidence for that.

@wrdcsc @emptywheel But the president-elect holds no constitutional office — certainly not before the Electoral College meets. Any powers or rights he has have been extended either by statute (Presidential Transition Act) or by courtesy of the outgoing president.

Funny story from historian Jon Meacham's eulogy for Barbara Bush. When he told her that he was mistaken at an airport bookstore for novelist John Grisham, she replied, "How do you think poor John Grisham would feel? He's a very handsome man."
Second reading at Bush funeral, read by grandchildren, comes from Proverbs: 		"A capable wife who can find?	She is far more precious than jewels.	The heart of her husband trusts in her,	and he will have no lack of gain.	She does him good, and not harm,	all the days of her life."
First lesson at Barbara Bush's funeral is from Ecclesiastes: 		"For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven: a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted; a time to kill, and a time to heal."

@derekwillis @ClatisC As I noted before, I have qualms about the government spending taxpayer money to do content analysis of specific journalist’s reporting. But a agree with Derek that it’s not illegal and definitely not unconstitutional.
@derekwillis That's actually what I'm worried about. I don't know what "sentiment" they'll be measuring, but let's say the algorithm concludes the reporter mostly quotes left-leaning sources — without considering the reporter spent the last year covering the Dem primaries.
@derekwillis So it's OK as long as they don't look under the hood?
@derekwillis Why does that make a difference? They're spending my tax money.
@derekwillis And when I say I'm not sure how I feel about that, I mean that I'm sure I don't like it.
@derekwillis I'm not freaked out. But I'm not sure how I feel about a government agency algorithmically determining whether the "sentiment" of a reporter's coverage is positive or negative, and determining whether to respond to my questions based on that algorithm.

@underthematrix @USATODAY I referred to him as “President Obama” on first reference. There are two presidents named Bush, so the first name and initial are important to differentiate.
@ColbyTNelson @FOIA_Ombuds @USNatArchives But I certainly appreciate your open-mindedness. I see this as an institutional failure, not a personal one. I'm sure @BarackObama has moved on and doesn't need to worry about his visitor logs any more.
@ColbyTNelson @FOIA_Ombuds @USNatArchives I want to be careful what I say, but I've had a number of conversations that have not borne fruit. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt, which is why I haven't said anything until now.
@elizabeth_joh 10 hours might as well be a week which might as well be a year. Are you all caught up on who hasn't been fired yet?
@ColbyTNelson I have asked the @FOIA_Ombuds help, but they haven't responded. (Granted, they're part of the @USNatArchives, so they're in an awkward position.) And yes, I'm unaware of any situation quite like this.
@ColbyTNelson I certainly interpreted "in a timely manner" to mean a manner similar to how they were released before -- allowing for maybe a few understandably delays because of the transition.
That's the law, and I accept that. But it's a disappointing epilogue to a presidency that promised a presumption of transparency above and beyond what was required by law. &lt;end&gt;
At this point, I can only circle Jan. 20, 2022 on my calendar. That's the date that the @USNatArchives will begin to release Obama's presidential records.
I asked the @USNatArchives for the data. No response.	I submitted a #FOIA for the data. They said the records were subject to the Presidential Records Act and could not be released under FOIA.	I called the Obama Presidential Library and Office of the Former President. No help.
So eight days before Trump's inauguration, I asked the White House how those logs would be handled and when they would be released. Here was the answer (emphasis mine): https://t.co/SmkWXG1IHs
But what that means is that the Obama White House never released the logs for November and December of 2016, or January 2017. That's an important time frame, because it was when a whole lot of Trump transition officials were traipsing through.
That's partially by design. The Obama policy was to release all visitor logs three months after the fact, ostensibly to give time for sensitive meetings (like Supreme Court nominees) to either resolve themselves or be scrubbed from the data.
Yes, President Trump's reversal of Obama's practice of releasing the logs is a problem. But in all the attention being paid to Trump, no one seems to have noticed that the last three months of Obama's visitor logs are missing.
To close out #SunshineWeek, I thought I'd post a quick thread about a lack of transparency about White House visitor's logs. 		Not President Trump's. President Obama's.

@TweetWhaley No, you're right. I'm just having trouble processing the undeniably good work he did with his final act -- especially since preserving his work by sending it to me (and a handful of others) is inexorably entwined with his last moments.
@Oslerguy Yeah, I saw you on the emails. We should talk. I'll try to call tomorrow.

@LouiseSchiavone Thanks. I'm a little unsettled, but it's nothing compared to the unfathomable grief his family must feel.
I'm not sure what I'll do with the data. He did important work, which now seems tainted. I do pray that God has mercy on his soul, and especially on the souls of his innocent sons. 		Thank you for listening.
I also got the impression that his passion for the subject of pardons was rooted in fundamental Christian values of redemption and forgiveness. Tonight I'm struggling to reconcile those ideals with such an unpardonable act.
I never met him in person, and can't presume to know what went so terribly wrong. I do know he was proud of his sons. Last year, he sent me a Youtube video of his 7th grader playing the National Anthem on guitar at a high school basketball game.

I called the Winnebago County Sheriff, in case the emails help to establish his intent, or the timeline. Obviously, there are a lot of questions left unanswered, and the investigation continues.
According to this @rrstar story, police found his body -- and that of his two boys, aged 12 and 14 -- at his home on Saturday, three days after the emails. The boys hadn't been in school since Wednesday. https://t.co/soTP31zF0v
I emailed him back right away, saying I was on deadline but would call him later. When he didn't call me back by Monday, I got worried. I checked his web site and Twitter feed. Then I googled him.
Still, I was a little surprised last Wednesday, when he emailed me the entire database -- in separate spreadsheets for each presidential administration, more than 30,000 records in all. "Would want you to have this and use freely," he wrote.
i kept in touch from time to time. Last year, when President Trump pardoned Joe Arpaio and people argued that it was unprecedented to pardon someone for contempt of court, Ruckman sent me a list of dozens of people pardoned for contempt back to President John Adams.
It was a great data set, and many times I asked if he wouldn't mind sharing it. But he said he was working on a book about the history of pardons and didn't want to release the data until that project was complete.
That data helped give me historical context for a number of stories I wrote about President Obama's use of his clemency power, for which I received the @PresGeraldRFord Foundation Award for Distinguished Reporting on the Presidency last year.
One of the things that made him such an authority was that he had painstakingly assembled, through countless hours of work at the National Archives, a comprehensive database of every pardon, commutation, respite and reprieve ever granted back to George Washington.
P.S. Ruckman Jr., who went by the twitter handle @pardonpower, was a leading expert on the presidential pardon power and clemency in general.
Six days ago, a source of mine unexpectedly emailed me a treasure trove of data. So far as I know, it was the last thing he did before committing murder-suicide.

(5) There's no set deadline: "I would ask that you keep me regularly apprised of your progress."
(4) There are no separate sections for the statement of policy and implementation. Also no general provisions, no severability clause, no "public right or benefit" clause -- or any of the other boilerplate regularly found in presidential orders.
(3) It contains some vague language outlining very basic principles: "I desire swift and decisive action," and "I remain committed to the rule of law."
(2) It blames Obama: "Although the Obama Administration repeatedly concluded that particular bump stock type devices were lawful to purchase and possess, I sought further clarification of the law restricting fully automatic machineguns."
This presidential memorandum on bump stocks looks like it was written in haste:		(1) It's largely written in the first person. I count seven first-person pronouns in six paragraphs.

Trump blasts 'treasonous' Democrats for not applauding at his State of the Union address https://t.co/FXrD4YxXll via @usatoday
President Trump says Democrats are anti-America for not applauding more often at his State of the Union address: "Someone said 'treasonous.' I guess, why not? Can you call that treason? Why not. They certainly didn’t seem to love our country very much."
This was billed as an official speech, but President Trump is off on an extended soliloquy on Pelosi, Schumer and the mid-term elections, with repeated shout-outs for GOP Senate candidate Jim Renacci.
White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah, aboard Air Force One: “Well, this isn’t a political event. The president’s there to talk about the tax cut bill that Congressman Renacci and many other Republicans in the House and Senate voted for.” https://t.co/tcsJEDgxgb
Accompanying President Trump on Air Force One for his official trip to Cincinnati today is Rep. Jim Renacci, whose district is nowhere near Cincinnati but who is running for the U.S. Senate against Sherrod Brown.

"The name is #resist. That's the name of their movement. That's all they do: resist. I don’t know if they’re good at it. They can't be too good at it. We’re passing a lot of things." -- @realDonaldTrump at the Republican National Committee winter meeting.

President Trump tells Republicans that hey may have to compromise with Democrats on immigration. But he ignored the elephant in the room, which is that he elephants in the room will also have to compromise with each other.
So far Trump's remarks to the Republican retreat sounds like a more insider-y version of his recent stump speeches -- but with much more name-checking of GOP members.

The White House appears to be disavowing the "Washington Monument" strategy of making a shutdown as painful and visible as possible. It could be a signal that Trump is content to let the clock run.

On the eve of final tax cut vote that will add $1.5 trillion to the national debt, here's what Trump's national security strategy says about debt: https://t.co/53Vb4l4lkN
Looking at the transcript of the speech, the context might have been more about the use of communication tools by the Islamic State.
In national security speech, Trump makes only oblique reference to Russian election interference, saying U.S. must "combat those who use the new domains of cyber and social media" to undermine U.S. society.
We're 15 minutes into the speech, and Trump has just now gotten around to mentioning the national security strategy the speech is ostensibly about.
The first part of President Trump's national security speech sounds a lot like an campaign speech — but delivered by teleprompter in a much more low-key, somber tone.
Trump begins national security speech "expressing deepest sympathies and most heartfelt prayers" for victims of train derailment in Washington state, says it emphasizes need for infrastructure spending.
References in Trump's national security policy to business climate: 3. References to weather climate: 1. https://t.co/c0m7KWZYZj

@howardwilkinson Who did Smitherman list on his successor designation certificate? That's the key test.
Trump says he would sign a tax bill with a 21% corporate rate, 1 point higher than previous proposal. "It’s at 35 right now, so if it got down to 21 I'd be thrilled."
Trump pushes for vote next week on tax reform: "Not because we lost a seat. As the leader of the party, I would have preferred to keep the seat."
@RobWAnderson @EricSchultz @nedprice It's your right as a news consumer to be skeptical of any information whose provenance isn't fully disclosed. I just don't want you to labor under the misconception that this method of reporting is new in any way.
@EricSchultz @nedprice I'm going to hold my tongue here, except to say I look forward to having this discussion again — privately — when you guys return to power.
@nedprice Do you think the coordinated leaking of information to multiple news outlets is somehow a new phenomenon, unheard of before the Trump administration?
@nedprice I'm really having trouble understanding the objection to this. Would you rather have the DOJ leak all the texts, or wait for Congress to leak just the ones that suit their purposes?
@MiamiUProf I counted 44, but some of those were different challenges to the same provision. I don't know how you keep it all straight.
People (and by people I mean losing candidates) tend to underestimate how daunting the math is in a recount. For every vote you gain, you’re just as likely to lose another. And provisionals and overseas generally break the same way.

@Shawna @jamespmanley Not necessarily. The Senate seats its members and can — and has —waived the rule by unanimous consent.
Elections belong to politicians, not the press. It’s their names on the ballot, not ours. And voters make the decisions, not newspapers. 		Still, I think we can take solace that a cynical campaign to discredit solid and credible reporting ultimately didn’t work. https://t.co/Uzmcl7jIkK

This one is interesting. Seven months ago, Trump objected to Guantanamo Bay provision because it did not include an exception for the transfer to a foreign country. Now, he's also concerned that there's no exemption for habeus corpus — i.e., a transfer to civilian courts. https://t.co/tlkiXUGblE
But Trump is also objecting to provisions like this one, which requires the administration to develop a strategy to combat Russia's "malign influence" and report to Congress. That's the kind of thing Congress does all the time. https://t.co/qWhKC6hns9
Presidents of both parties have zealously protected their power to recognize other nations, including the borders of those nations. The Supreme Court upheld that power in 2015 in the Jerusalem passport case.

@armadillosports @lshafran @JerryPodcast @jerryspringer Alas, he was born in England and so is constitutionally ineligible.

@DaveS_00 I mean Trump's executive order, which referenced Obama's EO 13692 in Section 5 by piggybacking on its national emergency declaration.
@tpodoll1 @SenKamalaHarris It looks like you're including commutations in this number. Actual number of Obama pardons was 212.
@realDonaldTrump @FedRegister (hat tip @ColbyTNelson for the excellent question.) https://t.co/2HJDSWLjo7
If @realDonaldTrump tweets are presidential statements, should they be included in Public Papers of the Presidents? I asked @FedRegister: https://t.co/zuaVJS1ows
New from the White House: President Trump is planning a trip to Texas early next week to survey damage from Hurricane Harvey.
RT @POTUSPressPool: 3 ET - @GregoryKorte joins @juliemason on SXM 124 to share an update on what President #Trump is up to today &amp; more. ht…
I thought this guy resigned from Sputnik.
@JonathanCookNC @POTUS @VP I can't see any reason why not. A tweet, it seems to me, is a written instrument. The only issue is delivery.
Resignation as @POTUS or @VP must be made in writing and delivered to Sec'y of State. (3 U.S.C §20) 		Alas, Rex Tillerson is not on Twitter. https://t.co/k1nOx8N7b1
@BradMossEsq Attn: @Buzzfeed.
@JesseFFerguson @Shareblue Far be it for me to defend Kellyanne, but it's not at all clear to me that that's what she's saying.
Periodic reminder that presidents can use emergency powers to seize your property without notice. (From Trump's Venezuelan sanctions EO.) https://t.co/MzpRTDZsCu
@TargTarger Sure. But if it's a quid pro quo, and Congress believes it's a conspiracy to obstruct justice, it could be an impeachable offense for Pence.
@codyjfoster I tend to focus on the institutional presidency, but there's vast interest in what I call the "personal" presidency. No detail is too small.
ICYMI, here's the story explaining how that 1929 solicitor general opinion allows for Twitter pardons: https://t.co/mLIKbncvoc
That process is run by the DOJ, but none of that is constitutionally necessary for president to grant pardons — by tweet or otherwise. (end)
But if by "paperwork" you mean the application, FBI background check, letters of support, recommendations, etc. — that's another matter. 9/
Trump could direct the pardon attorney — by phone, through the White House counsel, or by tweet — to pardon Arpaio and it would be done. 8/
Cartwright pardon is similar to Arpaio case in that he was convicted but not yet sentenced. So Trump could do it this way. 7/
In some cases, the president never touches the pardon warrant. Here's one Obama gave to Gen. Cartwright, signed by pardon attorney only. 6/ https://t.co/iYFuqHWwlX
The president then directs pardon attorney to sign each individual warrant and then forwarding each one to the recipient and the courts. 5/ https://t.co/EUf80yrU6n
Here's an example from President Obama, who pardoned 78 people in one fell swoop last year: https://t.co/BgboW2HfMH  4/
So beginning in the Eisenhower administration, the president began the practice of signing "master" warrants listing the people pardoned, 3/
A 1929 legal opinion says it's "wholly unnecessary (to) burden the president with the labor of signing the warrants" https://t.co/k50ol4JGLb
So I pulled examples of presidential pardon paperwork after people had questions about my story suggesting Trump could do it via Twitter. 1/
@codyjfoster I honestly don't know. I would presume there would be makeup at least for TV events. Not something I've spent a lot of time pondering.
@codyjfoster NP. White House isn't subject to FOIA, so I don't think there's a way to get more detail. Plus I think reimbursement is on his own warrant.
@codyjfoster Anything related to discharge of official duties. Statute seems to suggest that typical IRS business expense rules don't apply.
@codyjfoster In addition to his $400K salary, POTUS gets a $50K expense account. I presume it would pay for such expenses, but he doesn't have to itemize
RT @USATODAY: No need for paperwork: All it takes for Trump to pardon Sheriff Joe Arpaio is one tweet. https://t.co/8ehT2RH1E8
White House: Trump will follow "standard process" for Arpaio pardon — and that would likely mean FBI investigation. https://t.co/xcBO3K7qCw
Unusually ominous-sounding report from a U.S. counterintelligence agency: Our entire existence depends on enforcing patent laws. https://t.co/WWutdoSyOD
@ryanjreilly @ProfBrianKalt @s Or what if he simply retweets Arpaio pardoning himself?
@joshgerstein @ryanjreilly I read that! Do you know when Eisenhower policy was abandoned? I wonder if it's part of a perverse decrease in transparency because of #FOIA
@ryanjreilly "Pursuant to my authority as President I fully pardon @ProfBrianKalt for any federal offenses he has committed since 1/20/2017." (2/2)
@ryanjreilly A law prof at Michigan State gave me a 140-character format that he says could work: (1/2)
@ryanjreilly Not even entirely clear how public it has to be. Truman often pardoned people with no public notice. You could only find out at courthouse.
.@PressSec suggests Trump will ask for FBI investigation before deciding Arpaio pardon: "He'll go through a thorough and standard process,"
