@AJEnglish There was a guy who was interviewed who said he was in the USA n commited a crime so y don't u report that.... The dhs reports shows that almost 300 people among the people are gang members... USA is not done combatting ms13 n we don't need more crimes any more so they must .....
@AJEnglish President trump is protecting USA which is a core duty of a president n saying that they should come in legally... Do u know that we HV tapes showing that some democrats aspiring senators are supporting the illegal migrants... Listen to project veritas n report real news...
@AJEnglish Further disrespected their country's presidents n went further to throw rocks at the Mexican soldiers n police yet u are saying  they are poor angels and trump is being inhuman... Why are u so fake
@AJEnglish Now u are joining CNN to call the caravan of illegal migrants as poor people seeking asylum.... Question is there any war in el Salvador, Guatemala or Ecuador?there is no none so what asylum... They disrespected the instructions of the president when they set off.....
@AJEnglish U bring in pundits on ur news station who are just anti trump n not pro Americans.... They only love to bash a president who has done so much for us.what the hell are u trying to achieve by preaching falsehood to the middle east huh
