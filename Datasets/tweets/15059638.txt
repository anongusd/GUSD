@JWCDeuce @Acosta Trump claimed annual cost of illegal drugs is 500 billion so wall would pay for itself very quickly but current estimate of illicit drugs is 193 billion again the wall is unlikely to stop heroin coming in at legal entry points or the growing problem of fentanyl coming from China.
@JWCDeuce @Acosta The wall will be paid for indirectly by new trade deal. Nope. That is not how trade deals work. There will be lower tariffs but those are paid by consumers.
@JWCDeuce @Acosta Heroin smuggled by illegal immigrants into US. Most heroin is not smuggled in by illegal immigrants. Most is coming in through legal border entry points and a wall will do nothing to stem the tide of illegal drugs.
@JWCDeuce @Acosta Illegal immigrants drive down jobs and real wages. Economists, including Kevin Hassett, the top White House economist, believe that immigration spurs economic growth.
@JWCDeuce @Acosta He exaggerated the number of people attempting to cross the southern border daily. Customs and Border Protection, the agency responsible reports much lower numbers.
@JWCDeuce @Acosta He said the shutdown is for one reason only, the Democrats will not fund border security. Democrats have offered 1.3 billion in funding border security measures. Trump claimed responsibility for the shutdown in December when the GOP controlled House, Senate and presidency.
