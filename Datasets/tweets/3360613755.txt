@LeaderHoyer YOU WOULD GET YOUR MONEY BACK IF THEY WERN'T ON MEDICAID AND FOODSTAMPS WHEN THEY ARE NOT LEGAL.
@LeaderHoyer THE GOV WAS ALREADY OPENED AND NO ONE COULDN'T EVEN MAKE A DEAL.
@SenSchumer TIMES ARE CHANGING!
@SenSchumer oh makes since you are in New York no wonder the wall doesn't effect you. come live in cali.
@funder IT GOES BOTH WAYS, IF THE DEM WOULD COME TOGETHER THEN WE WOULD BE OPEN. YOU MUST NOT  WANT A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE @SpeakerPelosi.
@realDonaldTrump I see that the dem are killing ppl in mexico and if the wall is built they would get there money back in the long run for the wall 1 u would save on Medicaid, food stamps. @SpeakerPelosi we are at war with the ppl here in the us there is more crime.
RT @almostjingo: THEY HAD TWO KIDS?! What the actual hell is going on here both Muslim women in Congress married their relatives? This shit…
I am not a dem or a rep, I am indep person. @SpeakerPelosi I see @realDonaldTrump that he wants to comp with you and the way see is that you are the one keeping the gov shut down. U said that we cant do nothing in less the gov open. U still didn't comp with trump when it was open

@NBCNews Not doing the wall, Why even waist MONEY in the FIRST PLACE STARTING THE WALL?
@NBCNews HELLO you have the guy that is the drug guy from mexico there is the money for the WALL. I am sure you have his money..
I woke up so ANGRY trying to figure out to SAVE MYSELF and MY HEALTH. I went to drop off my Rx and got told that it expired? WHAT? @GovSandoval after 2 weeks in Nevada your Rx expires. Are kidding first if you drop off early u r a drug secure and so much more. U R CAUSING ME HARM
@USATODAY At that time ppl DID NOT REALLY KNOW YOU!
@LoriSwansonMN have you thought all meds are going up due to the opiod crises??
@GovSandoval how can there be a rainy day fund when there are bills that need to be paid???? ppl living on the streets, homes not being built.. it is like saving money when the bills need to be paid.. new governor please
@GovSandoval do you know that they are making pills on the street? you not only caused harm to chronic pain ppl, you are now making ppl get pills off the street. oh wait they get Narcan witch you wouldn't know what they are taking.
@LeoBeletsky @CDCInjury as ppl with chronic pain suffer for there bad behavior.
GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!
@CDCDirector  you have a problem.. you rather give to people that do drugs, instead of helping people with real chronic pain people. NOT RIGHT that we get to feel that we are the ones with the bad behavior. WE NEED A NEW DIRECTOR.
@POTUS @NancyPelosi  Why not go after the DRUG LORDS MONEY? When you arrested him am sure you got a lot of money.. And then MEXICO WILL PAY FOR IT..
@ThomasKlineMD Attorney needs to call about Do No HARM!!
IT IS TIME TO GO AFTER DOCTORS!THEY TOOK A OTH TO DO NO HARM! I HAVE MAJOR NERVE PROBLEMS WITCH CAUSES PAIN. @CDCDirector
My Religion denies any refusing medical and medicine. @CDCDirector @POTUS!! Is there someone that can help?
@CDCDirector I think you need to take a step back and look at the opiate crisis it is so unfair that you give people needles safe place to shoot up and also meds to keep them alive give to them and screw the people that have medical issues time to Sue you. please any attorney hlp
Since @POTUS came into office he has made it feel that not everyone is equal especially when it comes to our health I would love to go after trump for that.. It must be nice that he is so perfect he doesn't have medical issues and he doesn't have a learning disability.

@cynthiabydesign @CDCDirector @DebHouryCDC @CDCgov We need to start suing the people that are getting drugs off the street. Need to show that  we hv medical issues to the government so that we can fight getting our meds I think the people that need to go after are the ones that don't have no medical issues and that are drug acts
If I see somebody on drugs It makes me mad that they are allowed to when I have medical issues and I need my meds.  If you don't have medical issues then you need to be sued for doing drugs.
I was born with a learning disability which is caused me that problems with school and work.. I am now 40 and I have physical issues.. I'm not RICH but I'm feeling DISCRIMINATED for being on MEDICAID.. Since TRUMP came to office. Can I SUE YOU? @POTUS @FLOTUS

@AngelaKennecke @GayleKing @CBSThisMorning I'm sorry I wouldn't know what to do if my child passed on before me.. Please DO NOT make real CHRONIC PAIN people suffer.
@AngelaKennecke @CBSThisMorning See what happened 4 months ago which you've been trying to fight for 10 years never changed but people with chronic pain or suffering cuz the way you're putting it. It's drugs on the streets not meds from the pharmacies.
@AngelaKennecke @CBSThisMorning Please don't let other people suffer with real chronic pain in fact it should be drugs on the street not opiate.
@AngelaKennecke it's not fair that she chose that for her addiction but it's not fair for people that have real chronic pain.

@NBCNightlyNews @CynthiaMcFadden Try going to mental health and they said you are bipolar and puts you on meds and it makes you flip out. 2010 2011. I took myself off of those meds and had a study done in 2012 showing ADD/ADHD.. when I first went to mental health I told her that ADHD runs in my family.

@CynthiaMcFadden People that are hurting there self should be in mental health getting help. I was born with my problems and now I have to suffer cause of there bad behavior, when I do what is proscribed. And look at the suicide happening now. I don't hear no words for them. Hmmm!
@CynthiaMcFadden Go through my medical records. Don't judge me.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/AKxg7XSWi9
@NBCNightlyNews @CynthiaMcFadden We need to stop getting punished for someone else's bad behavior.. I am not afraid to have then go through my medical records, drug test ect. Until then DON'T JUDGE ME!
I think that the way Donald Trump speaks about the opiates problem is not coming from his heart. I think he just agrees with the gov, sen and that is his bargain powers over them. They get what they want and he gets his.

@RepMcKinley @POTUS Be nice if I could work, but no I am strapped to the couch from chronic pain. Cause no doctor want to help.

@ThomasKlineMD True that!
@ThomasKlineMD Thank you and God bless you, The patients you have are very happy.

@realDonaldTrump Ya if you don't let the chronic pain people suffer.
