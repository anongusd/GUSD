@PressSec @trumps_feed @realDonaldTrump Wasn’t this a Bill that Democrats tried to get passed for 6 years but the GOP refused?		Donald doesn’t even know what this Bill is about and you’re trying to give him credit.
@cgtillis @BeachDude80s @RepMattGaetz @Ocasio2018 Seems like you’re trying to deflect.	That’s understandable : Republicans don’t have a plan for solving our healthcare challenges... they’ve never had one.
@Esteban_20k @realDonaldTrump I agree this is a solid piece of bipartisan legislation and the Administration deserves credit for supporting it.		But don’t get too excited: Donald didn’t write this tweet, he doesn’t care about criminal justice reform and he has no idea what’s in the Bill.

@RepMattGaetz Matt understands less about healthcare economics than he does about how to perform congressional oversight.		That he was elected at all is utterly baffling.
@RepMarkMeadows A question that needs answering:		WTF value do you bring to the people of #NC11?
@piersmorgan @trumps_feed Why restrict yourself to a list of terrible options?		“No Brexit” is not a terrible option.
@JohnCornyn @WSJopinion A Bill that learns from the GOP’s experience committing crimes at the state level?	Cool.
@KatrinaPierson @trumps_feed He did need the Russians though.
@piersmorgan @trumps_feed I don’t understand people who are offended when the EU defends its own interests. Brexiteers have been very clear that the EU is the “other” and should be vehemently opposed.		Also, I don’t recall “We’ll survive” being one of the Leave campaign’s slogans.

@SenJoniErnst Where is your plan?	You’re rejoicing taking away healthcare from millions of Americans and yet in 9 years of criticizing ACA, you have never offered a better solution.	Not. Even. Once.
@chiproytx The person who writes this kind of tweet has no clue how the ACA works and has no clue about healthcare economics in general.		There are no ideas to the right of ACA that will address the problems we face. None.

@AdamSerwer Which is, incidentally, why we shouldn’t talk about « saving the planet » because the planet will be just fine (albeit more like Venus); it’s our species that needs saving.
@AdamSerwer The only explanation I can come up with is that he’s being ridiculously facetious.	He’s taking issue with the claim « existential threat to the planet ».	What DeFazio should have said is « existential threat to humanity ».
@realDonaldTrump This tweet was threaded and, therefore, obviously not written by Donald... who is, let’s face it, probably sulking in his room.
@RepAbraham According to Individual 1, Mexico is already paying for the wall, so you shouldn’t need any « wall money ».

@Think51783608 @TassajaraRd @thephilosotroll @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump @CatoInstitute @immcouncil Everyone is in favor of securing the border - we just disagree that a wall is an effective way to do that. 	Every other country, with the exception of Israel and the seven kingdoms of Westeros, manages just fine without one.

@Think51783608 @TassajaraRd @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump A. That number is from a FAIR report that has been dubunked on both right &amp; left.	B. Its (inaccurate) estimate is for total current unauthorized immigrants. A wall can only deter future immigrants.	C. Your president was very clear Mexico would pay for it.
@weartv @RepMattGaetz @DanielleApoNews It might take a while: Matt’s day job - carrying water for #Individual1 - is keeping him kinda busy right now.
@neal_katyal A. Trump doesn’t have « decent counsel ».		B. Trump is a narcissist and will do absolutely anything to avoid shame: he won’t resign.
@realWyattGurp @j_b_cline @NotNotBill @porter14159 @AnnCoulter Sooo...to recap: studies show that in-person voter fraud is virtually non-existent; you have *no* data to support your position but expect people to believe literally millions are committing felonies for no perceptible personal gain.	I think we’re done here, buttercup.
@realWyattGurp @j_b_cline @NotNotBill @porter14159 @AnnCoulter Yet, in spite of the data and in spite of simple logic &amp; common sense, numbskulls continue to believe that they do it by the hundreds of thousands.	#FTFY
@j_b_cline @NotNotBill @porter14159 @AnnCoulter Yes, because when you’re an illegal immigrant, committing a felony that carries a $5,000 fine and a 5 year sentence in federal prison just so some politician you’ve never met can have one extra vote seems like a worthwhile risk.
@MollyJongFast To be clear, he will blame the Democrats and he will deny that he said he wouldn’t and his base will believe him.
@Rightstuffer @DavidLammy @Nigel_Farage Farage’s « success » was getting enough people to fall for his lies and then letting someone else take the heat for not being able to deliver on them.

@piersmorgan @trumps_feed Remainers are all 100% clear on what we should do.	It’s the multitude of Leave factions who can’t agree on WTF to do.	Which is why it’s facile to the point of being dishonest to argue that “Leave” won a referendum.	#PeoplesVote

@HoarseWisperer It’s interesting to see the angle he takes. To keep his viewers, the « distancing » has to include a rationalization that will give them permission to dump him too.	Carlson seems to be going with: « It’s not us, Donald: it’s you.».
@itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump The « buyers » in this case were the Russians and, in their defense, Trump’s lack of dignity was a feature not a bug.
@realDonaldTrump When asked for comment, former Fox News host and current UN Ambassador, Heather Nauert said, “We have a very strong relationship with the government of Japan; today is the 76th anniversary of Pearl Harbor”	https://t.co/NjQl0C6By9
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump She’s the one who said D-Day was an example of the strong relationship the US has with Germany.		What could possibly go wrong?
@SheGotNoStyle @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I dunno - Fox &amp; Friends has been dictating government policy for the last 2 years and only a few people have died so far.
@realDonaldTrump Yeah - we should never elect a conman who conspires with a foreign power again.

@SuperElitee @Lomandra @drawandstrike The more a defendant helps, the better the sentence recommendation. It’s not rocket science.	Your pal, Mikey, gave 19 interviews and the recommendation is for *no* incarceration. 	The Donald is fucked.
@SuperElitee @Lomandra @drawandstrike Fun fact: the probability that you have to “lose it” is inversely proportional to the probability that Trump is completely &amp; utterly screwed.
@RepMattGaetz @seanhannity @FoxNews Plenty of lawlessness in the Administration - you could’ve held them accountable; instead you spent your time propping them up. 	Which is why you’re now in the minority and have to resort to going on Fox News*.	Sad.
@danpfeiffer But I think we can all agree that, as he paid his respects to GHWB, today was the day Trump became president.
@tomwatson He planned to but he ended up wandering towards the Washington Monument and the Secret Service had to go fetch him.	https://t.co/Zfo6DYMcOE
@TelePolitics @Nigel_Farage He needs some time to get his affairs in order.		#MuellerIsComing
@danpfeiffer His only frame of reference is the Russian mob. 		He think “tariffs” are semantically equivalent to protection money.
@BillOReilly @trumps_feed So what you’re saying is: “Reality has a well-known liberal bias.”
@JohnZilli @GoodwinMJ @Nigel_Farage @Telegraph Someone sounds like they’re afraid they’ll lose.
@Nigel_Farage @trumps_feed @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Yeah, Donald is cowering in a closet somewhere in the WH residence so Fox News* needs a substitute blustering cockwomble who colludes with Russians.
@davidcicilline @realDonaldTrump I’m sure @KrisKobach1787 is beside himself with outrage.		Someone should check.

@CharlesPPierce This seems so obvious.		Of course Mueller knows (and can prove) the answers to *all* of the questions he asked. That’s the whole point of the exercise.		Lawyering 101: never ask a question to which you don’t already know the answer.

@RepMattGaetz Malfeasance? That’s quite an allegation, buttercup.		Given Rick Scott is the current governor, incompetence seems a more plausible explanation.		Add it to the reasons he ought to lose.
@daniel_hervig @RepMarkMeadows https://t.co/pX58xsoDiY
@marcorubio 	This is all you, dumbass.	Maybe you could look into Obama’s birth certificate next? https://t.co/xAhVC51bGB
@NateSilver538 @jonfavs Personally, I’m not passing judgment on Bret’s argument before I’ve heard what Tom Friedman’s taxi driver in Mumbai has to say.
@RepByrne Could you use a different phrase than “thoughts &amp; prayers”, which is well-known congressional speak for “I’m going to do absolutely nothing about gun violence”?		This man’s death is indeed tragic and I believe you care about his family’s loss.
@ConserValidity @mikiebarb @Acosta @PressSec It's a Presidential Press Conference, not a Jim Acosta Press Conference.  Rather than impeding free speech and denying citizens their right to information, the intern should let the press ask their questions and the President should bloody well answer them.		Fixed it for you.
@mikiebarb @PressSec @Acosta And while *she* is trying to grab the mic from him, *he* says “Pardon me, ma’am”.		Not sure how he could’ve been more polite about it.
@Jayhawker88 @pax527 @mtaibbi Came here to offer the same quote. Thanks for covering, fam!		Also, credit where it’s due:  @jonrog1
@seanhannity @trumps_feed Maybe Tucker could ask Dr. Ford for some tips in dealing with this sort of thing. I’m sure she would take his call.		https://t.co/Ifm1fq9Uao
@AnnCoulter @trumps_feed Yeah, making sure people who have been drinking have access to firearms sounds like an awesome idea.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/WJASBCdQR5
@RepMattGaetz So... “conservative principles” means “blowing a $1.5T hole in the budget to benefit my wealthy donors”.		And “fighting for you” means “voting to take away your healthcare”.		Got it.
@BillOReilly @trumps_feed If someone were actually proposing an “open border” policy, then your question might have some merit.		Since no one is proposing that, it does not.		Let’s talk instead about how destructive straw man arguments are.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed @PressSec His ultimate need is to be adored.		And if he can rake in a ton of money for the Trump Organization while you’re adoring him, that would be awesome.
@jonathanchait Which is not to say that, in the meantime, Mueller’s team is just sitting around eating bonbons:	https://t.co/ID7c6LD80P
@redsteeze Republicans have no idea how to fix the problems of our healthcare system: they had 7 years and failed miserably.		And now they’re making things worse.		The country wants Medicare For All. 		That’s what Democrats are running on.
@clubodaddy @RepLeeZeldin @ICEgov So you agree the policy is inhumane.		That’s progress.
@RepMattGaetz @HouseGOP @POTUS You voted to take healthcare away from 23 million Americans, to blow a $1.5T hole in the deficit, and you’ve done nothing about #climatechange.		You are failing the people of #FL01.	Which is why they’re voting for @DrZ4Congress
@RepLeeZeldin @ICEgov Agency X performs valuable function A and inhumane act B... but they have your “full support”?		Cool.
@senorrinhatch Very unfortunate that the Senate decided to forego the tradition of rejecting nominees who are unfit to serve on the bench.		#RubberStampRepublicans
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @BillHemmer @AmericaNewsroom You could save everyone a lot of time &amp; effort if you just wrote:		“I fully support @realDonaldTrump “		And pinned it.
@piersmorgan @trumps_feed @realDonaldTrump To wit:	https://t.co/krtk2LiWjU
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Other things you also applaud:	- blowing a $1.5T hole in the budget to benefit the wealthy	- taking healthcare away from 23M people	- doing nothing about climate change.		Which is why the people of #AZ05 are applauding @joangreeneaz all the way to the ballot box.
@piersmorgan @trumps_feed @realDonaldTrump Because he’s a narcissist.		He has only two drivers:	- He needs to be adored;	- He needs to avoid shame.
@SteveScalise Every part of this is a lie.	You blew a $1.5T hole in the budget, you allowed Trump to put children in cages, and despite 297 mass shootings &amp; your own horrific experience, you’ve done nothing about gun violence.		Which is why #LA01 is voting for @tammyforla
@bob666667 @carolecadwalla @andywigmore @campbellclaret @Arron_banks “We will have to wait and see.”		Bob the bot has a flair for Trumpisms.
@Scotttaylorva “I didn’t say the Country Club could refuse your membership; I just agreed they could discriminate against you &amp; charge you a bajillion dollars to join.”
@SteveKingIA “attacks”		We need more grammar nazis and fewer actual nazis.
@RepSteveChabot We should all be disgusted at your abject failure to actually do anything about gun violence.		Which is one of the many reasons the people of #OH01 are voting for @AftabPureval on November 6th.
@MarshaBlackburn “I am praying” https://t.co/pwd7LL5k8o
@Scotttaylorva Hope is not a strategy.		The people of #VA02 need a representative who will act.		Vote for @ElaineLuriaVA on November 6th.
@RepJeffDuncan Oh no, we’re not doing this again. 		The people of #SC03 need a legislator who will *act* on this issue.		Vote for @MaryGeren on November 6th.
@RepDLamborn Why have you done nothing about enacting sensible gun control laws so that people don’t get shot while practicing their religion on International Religious Freedom Day?		#CO05 deserves someone who will act.		Vote for @StephanyForCO on November 6th.
@RepDLamborn “The ability to freely practice any religion is a God-given right.” https://t.co/fWHemJQllW
@RepAndyBiggsAZ You also supported taking healthcare away from 23 million Americans and blowing a $1.5 Trillion hole in the deficit to benefit corporations and wealthy donors.		Which is why #AZ05 is voting for @joangreeneaz on November 6th.
@SteveScalise And yet just last week your President glorified the violence of a Republican candidate who body slammed a reporter and you shrugged it off as a joke.
@ClaraJeffery Sadly, if that were the actual slogan for the Republican Party it wouldn’t matter.		Nothing matters.		That’s where we are.
@MikeTokes This is the art work of @WinstonTseng - also famous for the “Your Train Is Delayed” subway parody poster.		Thanks for not freaking out about it.
@Scotttaylorva Totally agree that “violence &amp; terrorism [have] no place in our society”.		Not convinced I have to “respect [the] political position” of someone who voted to take healthcare away from 23M Americans.
@GOPChairwoman @trumps_feed Republicans have managed all on their own to screw Americans out of their healthcare, blow up the deficit while giving $1.5TN to the wealthy, dismantle treaties and destroy the environment.		What was your point about Nancy again?
@erie11111 @SteveScalise @tammyforla There are two possibilities:	1. You live in LA-01 and you’re an idiot.	2. You don’t live in LA-01 and have no clue just how environmentally fcked the district is.		Either way, you probably ought to go crawl back under your rock.
@WalshFreedom As a candidate, don’t you need to ensure you have made your argument before voting begins?
@Jordanfabian Does Donald think he’s a fcking judge on “Nailed It!” ??
@marcorubio @POTUS Every candidate should be asked what they’re going to do about healthcare, stagnant wages, protecting Medicare &amp; Social Security, and about tackling Climate Change.		These are all real problems affecting Americans *today*.
@danpfeiffer The positive takeaway is that non-conservative media aren’t being suckered into parroting the #GOP narrative.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed @larry_kudlow I’m 100% certain Larry is better off. https://t.co/wvGgQqP7Ug
@piersmorgan @trumps_feed Donald would fail.		He’d fail the same way he’s failed to deliver cheaper healthcare; the same way he’s failed to build a wall; the same way he’s failed to bring back mining jobs.		We’d crash out of the EU and he’d blame someone else.
@seanmdav A lie, for which he apologized.		Compared to a President who lies at a rate of 7.6 times PER DAY...		...but, hey, nice try.	https://t.co/ADKJZ2VtDy

@johnpfreem @nahmias @joshtpm @Newsday Underrated tweet.
@IngrahamAngle @trumps_feed Unsurprised to hear that you think Americans suffering from skyrocketing healthcare costs and stagnant wages is “hilarious”.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed @RichardGrenell I didn’t see the context of the original remark but, at the current rate of change, the climate is on track to end human civilization so....
@jonfavs This seems so obvious.		Don’t be distracted - whenever &amp; wherever you see this narrative being pushed, pivot back to what the GOP *doesn’t* want to talk about.	i.e. the issues that voters actually care about.
@seanhannity @trumps_feed It’s certainly a Republican emergency.		The #GOP wants voters to focus on this issue instead of the 23M people whose healthcare they cut or the $1.5TN they added to the deficit &amp; gave to the rich or their plans to gut Medicare &amp; Social Sec.		The #GOP thinks voters are idiots.
@TomCottonAR I can’t believe the Mexican government isn’t throwing these refugees into cages.		I’m sure Republicans will agree.
@FoxBusiness @RepChuck Chuck wants you to focus on this rather than the fact that he voted to give $1.5 TN to corporations &amp; to take healthcare away from 23M people. And that he intends to dismantle Medicare &amp; Social Sec., which we all paid into.		We can stop him.		VOTE FOR	@DMMD4TNCongress 	#TN03
@DaveBratVA7th On healthcare, voters have a clear choice.	On Medicare &amp; Social Security, voters have a clear choice.	On decent wages, voters have a clear choice.	On climate change, voters have a clear choice.		That’s why #VA07 is voting for @SpanbergerVA07
@IngrahamAngle @trumps_feed What we need to take a stand against is Republicans who blew a $1.5TN hole in the deficit in order to benefit corporations and who now intend to pay for it by taking away our hard earned Medicare &amp; Social Security benefits.	#voteblue
@SteveScalise Yes,	VOTE for the candidate who didn’t blow a $1.5TN hole in the deficit; 		who didn’t take away healthcare from 23 million Americans; 		and who isn’t sitting around eating bonbons while Climate Change is threatening our very existence.		VOTE for Tammy Savoie	#LA01	@tammyforla
@FoxNews @RepRatcliffe It’s called “oversight”.		Your failure to understand that is one of the many* reasons #TX04 is voting for @Krantz4Congress 		*Lest anyone should forget you voted to blow a $1.5TN hole in the deficit, take healthcare away from 23M people and do nothing about climate change.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ You’re believing a guy who lies about as often as he breathes?
@FoxBusiness @Jim_Jordan Are you hoping to distract voters from the the fact that you: 	 	- voted to take healthcare away from millions of Americans.		- voted to give $1.5TN to wealthy donors &amp; special interests.		- have done nothing about climate change.		#OH04 Vote for @Janet4OH
@CasiGmail @GDVF @JoeVajgert @SteveKingIA @LindsayGrahamSC Err...I was talking to @GDVF.
@cathymcmorris To the intern running this account: you should quit and do something more rewarding.		Repeating the same lie day in and day out in the vain hope some sucker will fall for it must be soul crushing for you. 		And it’s frightfully dull for the rest of us.

@RepKevinBrady Republicans excluded Democrats from the conference committee, removed provisions that allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices and to import cheaper drugs from Canada. 		Thanks for reminding us just how long the #GOP has been screwing American taxpayers on healthcare.
@GOPChairwoman @trumps_feed The #GOP has done nothing for hard working Americans.	You’ve saddled them with debt and ripped them off to pay wealthy donors.	You’ve taken away their healthcare and you’re destroying their environment.	You have literally nothing to run on.	This is all you’ve got.
@realDonaldTrump You mean like the story where you committed millions of dollars of tax fraud and how your entire origin story is a lie?		https://t.co/ZdacYMFHel
@TheRynoMiller @DennisPCrawford @DonJBacon Incidentally, one of the reasons we know there isn’t a solely private solution is because ACA was itself based on a Heritage Foundation idea. If there were a better market-based solution, Republicans would’ve suggested it years ago.
@TheRynoMiller @DennisPCrawford @DonJBacon That’s less of a premise and more of a conclusion.	We have plenty of evidence that private entities can’t solve this problem alone and we understand pretty well - from both domestic &amp; international examples - what works and why.
@tomwatson Because, if there’s one thing Americans are tired of it’s all the Executive Branch oversight Congress is conducting.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump You have no plan to address climate change.	You have no plan to address rising healthcare costs.	You have no plan to address stagnant wages.		The people of #LA01 deserve a representative who has a plan and who will *act*.		@tammyforla
@MarioDB @HouseAppropsGOP Our planet faces an imminent threat from Climate Change.		Your record on this issue is abysmal.		The people of #FL25 don’t need your thoughts. They need someone who will *act*.		@MBFforCongress
@TheRynoMiller @DennisPCrawford @DonJBacon Well, no, because your “premium” is levied through a tax, and IRS costs don’t vary based on the amount you’re taxed.		If someone proposed a *new* tax then, yes, I’d agree. But that seems unnecessary - you’re just adding to the number of enrollees of existing services.
@TheRynoMiller @DennisPCrawford @DonJBacon Depending on your insurer, ~20% of your premium goes to admin costs.	Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services’ costs are consistently around 3%.		Pro-tip: it helps when you have the infrastructure of the IRS to collect your premiums. ;)
@sendavidperdue Climate change represents an imminent threat to human civilization. Your president doesn’t care.	What’s your plan? 	Because Tweets telling people to batten down the hatches are not going to cut it.
@TheRynoMiller @DennisPCrawford @DonJBacon *And* you get to cover everyone.	*And* you lower costs for the whole system.	*And* you don’t have to stay in a job you hate just for the health benefits.
@TheRynoMiller @DennisPCrawford @DonJBacon At the risk of butting in to what is so far a civilized discussion, I don’t see a way of funding it without increasing taxes. *But* Medicare has more bargaining power *and* much lower admin costs than private insurance. So the tax increase is less than your current premium.
@GovMikeHuckabee @taylorswift13 Is this the “no impact” you had in mind? https://t.co/ujEUcHCRrq

@senorrinhatch The credibility and integrity of Congress has already been flushed down the toilet.		Looks like you’re a about to do the same to the SCOTUS.
@senorrinhatch Notice you still failed to release 95% of Kavaugh’s records.
@DRUDGE_REPORT @trumps_feed Keep going with the climate change denial and soon enough every “tribe” will be fighting for survival...	...and they’ll all lose.
@RepKevinBrady I’m sure Donald will be OK with it.	He had said he would realease returns once the audit was over.	I’m sure he just forgot.
@Brock_Harris @Principalaz @nick_field90 @Redistrict Cool.	Can you let me know when the checking &amp; balancing is supposed to start?
@girknicks @GeraldoRivera @trumps_feed What is she going to gain?
@GeraldoRivera @trumps_feed Reminder: she knows more than she’s telling but she’s discussing only the facts about which she is 100% certain.	She has nothing to gain from this and everything to lose.	Meanwhile, Kavanaugh’s “choir boy” narrative is simply not credible given the evidence.
@JohnCornyn You already know she’s telling the truth.		If you boys thought she were lying, you’d all be lining up to drag her over hot coals.		Instead, you’ve delegated your job to a “female assistant”.
@JohnCornyn At its most basic level, you need to determine whether he’s a liar.		Spoiler alert: He is. 		His first words were a lie: “No president has ever consulted more widely, or talked with more people from more backgrounds, to seek input about a Supreme Court nomination.”
@Vanila_Flav @freddyjet2016 @RepMarkMeadows Kavanaugh’s records are an order of magnitude more voluminous than previous nominees.	Burck, a private lawyer &amp; friend, is helpfully deciding which ones we get to see.	https://t.co/PwWTIWRa25
@Vanila_Flav @freddyjet2016 @RepMarkMeadows Withholding 95% of the nominee’s records doesn’t sound very transparent to me.

@JohnCornyn Still missing 95% of Kavanaugh’s records.
@CaptainMinear @janmaxwell @mj_lee Alternatively, you could start from the good faith position that she’s telling the truth. #BelieveWomen
@DictoSermo @bmedina__ @SteveScalise One more try and then I think I’m done here.	The problem is not “Einar doesn’t have a job”.	The problem is “70 million Americans have no or inadequate health insurance”.
@DictoSermo @bmedina__ @SteveScalise Alternatively, you could do no research, misstate the problem and continue to look like an idiot.
@DictoSermo @bmedina__ @SteveScalise Or you could spend more than 3 minutes thinking about the problem. 	You’ll realize pretty quickly why “get a job” doesn’t cut it as an argument and you won’t sound like an idiot.	Win/win!
@DictoSermo @bmedina__ @SteveScalise Wait.	Your rule was you need a job to have healthcare.	The Walmart employee has a job.	It seems like you’re now saying you need to have a *good* job?
@DictoSermo @bmedina__ @SteveScalise I need a job to have healthcare?		So if I’m a Walmart employee making minimum wage, I can have healthcare?		But if I’m a trust fund baby who sits around all day eating bonbons, I can’t have healthcare?
@cnsnews @SteveScalise Steve is trying to distract you from the fact that he’s failing the hard working people of #LA01. He has:	- failed to generate decent paying jobs for them;	- failed to protect their healthcare;	- failed to tackle climate change.	#LA01 deserves much better.	@tammyforla
@damnlib @DonJBacon Can’t like this enough. https://t.co/idOm2s8kQI
@SteveScalise Maybe, instead of Thoughts &amp; Prayers, you could use the time to propose legislation to tackle climate change so these events aren’t so severe. 	Also, return the money you took from FEMA: they’re going to need it.
@Against_Klep @realDonaldTrump Unfortunately, it’s *always* about his ego.		Narcissist gonna narcissism.
@RepMattGaetz The people of #FL01 want jobs that pay decent wages; they want affordable healthcare; they want Medicare &amp; Social Security protected.		All you can do is drone on about this nonsense like a broken record.		But November is coming.		@DrZ4Congress
@senorrinhatch Nope.	Kavanagh has the lowest approval rating of any SCOTUS nominee since Bork.		You’re on the wrong side of this issue and you know it.
@DarrellIssa @realDonaldTrump Maybe read the article.	Or find someone who can read to explain it to you.

@derekahunter @Scotttaylorva @Apple @facebook @YouTube @Spotify These private companies are realizing that they’re media outlets. They don’t know yet how to handle that role but they know they have a fiduciary responsibility to protect their brands.	Alex Jones can go create his own platform.
@DesJarlaisTN04 The idea that every American would have health insurance and that no one would go bankrupt from medical expenses really scares the crap out of you, doesn’t it.
@RepJasonLewis You have no solutions on healthcare - the last 9 years of a #GOP Congress whining about repeal &amp; replace prove that.		And now you’re afraid because #MedicareForAll threatens a cornerstone of your ideology.		Too bad.
@SteveKingIA It might seem that way because your Republican colleagues aren’t calling you out for being a white nationalist....	...but every decent American (left &amp; right) find your views abhorrent.		Don’t pretend you haven’t heard their arguments.
@SteveKopack No bank worth its salt is going to fall for this: they do want to embed transaction processing capabilities where the User is but they know protecting the privacy of their customers’ data is paramount. Giving that up would be suicidal.

@RepMarkMeadows Your incessant attempts to undermine our democratic institutions have become such a bore.		November can’t come soon enough, you insufferable toad.
@realDonaldTrump BREAKING: Ivanka Trump revises remarks: “I’ve checked the transcript and I would like to clarify. In a key sentence in my remarks I said ‘don’t’ instead of ‘do’. The sentence should’ve been: ‘I do believe the press is the enemy of the people’”
@JohnCornyn @WSJopinion Which is less than we pay today.	It’s almost as if you didn’t read the report. https://t.co/WumWGBuN6j
@SenTedCruz An increasing number of Americans want #MedicareForAll so... good job going on record as a supporter of crappy private insurance plans.	#BetoForTexas
@Petes2001 @jonfavs Speaking of which, how’s Phil Ehr doing? 	Definitely interested in drop kicking Gaetz into obscurity - a contemptible fraction of a human being if ever I saw one.
@RepJasonLewis Trump appointed someone who doesn’t believe in the mission of the agency they were asked to lead?	I’m shocked.	#CMS	#EPA	#HUD	#OGE	...etc.
@RepKevinYoder And that cost is less than if we keep the current system 	And we get to cover 30 million more people 	And we do away with co-pays &amp; employer cost sharing 	And you don’t have to stay in a job just for the health benefits.		What was your point again?
@RepMarkMeadows The report says #MedicareForAll SAVES $303B over 10yrs.	Private ins. admin costs are 13% M4A’s would be 6%.		Bonus: co-pays/cost-sharing disappear and 30M more people are covered.		Maybe take a break from licking Donald’s jackboots &amp; read the report.
@piersmorgan @trumps_feed Every Leaver will tell you they know what Brexit meant when they voted but the chaos we have now is because there was no shared understanding of what it meant.		That’s a fault in the construction of the original referendum that needs to be fixed. https://t.co/hxKitv87l4
@Astros290 @JohnCornyn @ABC Came here to make this comment. Thanks for taking care of it!
@jasonlschwartz Charging extra for a behavioral choice that has a material risk of placing a higher cost on the overall system seems reasonable.	Employers already use this “stick” for employees who choose not to give up smoking.

@charliekirk11 Also, Chicago is built on an island only accessible via a drawbridge so there’s zero chance anyone brought guns in from, say, Indiana where there are virtually no gun controls.

@foxandfriends @trumps_feed Why would they?	Isn’t Mexico paying for it?
@AngieEVanScyoc @ARmastrangelo @PattyArquette Underrated comment.
@BruceC76 @ByronYork No, I’m talking about the financial crisis of 2008-9 that happened on this planet.		Remember Boehner: “It’s time for government to tighten their belts”?
@BruceC76 @ByronYork Krugman’s Nobel prize was for his work on trade theory - a topic Trump could use some help with.	His macro views, based on a Keynes-Fisher-Minsky model, were completely vindicated during the financial crisis while he comprehensively debunked conservatives’ austerity theories.

@RepJerryNadler @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Ready the pitchforks.
@piersmorgan @trumps_feed Yes, because there are people who don’t care for Donald’s misogyny, his racism, his kleptocracy, or his debasement of our country in front of a foreign adversary but who draw the line at defacing an award on a sidewalk.
@ScottAdamsSays @RepMattGaetz Gaetz et al were targeted by an algorithm that filters out “troll-like behaviors”.		The simple fix: less douchebaggery/water carrying for a corrupt president; more focus on the issues facing the people of #FL01

@RealityCheckout @Jaget1345 @realDonaldTrump @addicted2newz The UK is a constitutional monarchy, not a constitutional democracy.		I’m not sure I should be surprised that a Leaver, who was conned by a fairy tale about reclaimed sovereignty, doesn’t even know what system of government they have.
@RealityCheckout @Jaget1345 @realDonaldTrump @addicted2newz Listen to yourself. One minute you’re trotting out the facile “leave means leave” BS. The next minute it’s “complex AF”.	Which is it? 	You know who told you it was “complex AF” from day one?	Remainers.
@RealityCheckout @Jaget1345 @realDonaldTrump @addicted2newz Brexit was the lie.	Those who voted for it were played but they’re going to march the country off a cliff anyway because they’re all too embarrassed to admit it.
@RealityCheckout @Jaget1345 @realDonaldTrump @addicted2newz You, along with the rest of the UK, are already being shafted by a Conservative party that couldn’t organize a piss-up in a brewery let alone a Brexit agreement with the EU.		Your reticence towards any additional sexual violation is entirely understandable.
@mike_pence @BrianKempGA @realDonaldTrump Ooh! I do hope you are fully behind him.	That always helps.
@ErinGaetz Yeah, probably 23 bots!		Also, I’m not sure an asteism was the right way to go here. It’s witty but by attacking me instead of addressing the premise of my comment (i.e. Matt is a Trump lapdog) you sort of concede the point...	...which I’m sure you didn’t intend to do.

@13leatherhesnik @torrymeade @to_consider @MattWolking The details in the indictments are very specific.

@twright55 @RepDonBeyer Please don’t presume to speak for the rest of us, Tatiana.
@GOPChairwoman @trumps_feed The reason voters didn’t punish #GOP for #MerrickGarland is because they didn’t grasp the consequences.		If you nominate a judge who wants to take away a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body, I can’t promise you the same level of indifference.

@rowdyrr9 @RealFurgas @SenatorCantwell Democrats tried to play nice with Republicans and got screwed by them.	We won’t make that mistake again.	We’re going to demand Single Payer - the #GOP can either propose something better or get TF out of the way.	#MedicareForAll
@rowdyrr9 @RealFurgas @SenatorCantwell And so they criticize it and slowly dismantle it but they’re unable to solve the problems Americans are facing with rising healthcare costs.	The answer is there in front of them but ideology prevents them proposing it.
@rowdyrr9 @RealFurgas @SenatorCantwell And therein lies the problem: Republicans are trapped in an ideological cul-de-sac - they could never “repeal &amp; replace” because there are no answers to the right of ACA. There are only answers to the left.
@rowdyrr9 @RealFurgas @SenatorCantwell And that’s the painful thing about ACA: Obama bent over backwards to get Republican support for it. It’s a Heritage Foundation proposal and includes a heap of GOP amendments and still. It one of them voted for it.
@rowdyrr9 @RealFurgas @SenatorCantwell Sorry, I don’t see that - can you be more specific?	To be clear I am *not* a fan of free market healthcare.	ACA is as free market a solution as you can get but it lacks (as others have pointed out) adequate cost control mechanisms.
@CattledogMeg @SenatorCantwell Here’s a perfect example of the waste in our system: $10 for a Hall’s cough drop. I kid you not.	https://t.co/zfgAgTsdja
@RealFurgas @rowdyrr9 @SenatorCantwell Yes - the IRS is your premium collection system. But that’s the point: you’re paying for that anyway! In effect it’s a “competitive advantage” of the single payer model - that’s a feature not a bug. :)
@CattledogMeg @SenatorCantwell It costs everyone too much: it consumes ~18% of GDP. I think I’m France it’s ~10% - and they cover everyone and have better outcomes than we do. Part of that is private systems cost more to run + adverse incentives in insurance, provider &amp; delivery systems.
@joeyinthewoods @rowdyrr9 @SenatorCantwell I don’t know what you mean by “you people”?	I have a good job &amp; my plan is through my employer but it’s still expensive.	And the problem is not the very poor - it’s the “donut hole” of middle class Americans who don’t qualify for Medicaid but can’t afford private insurance.
@rowdyrr9 @jgjolmesli @SenatorCantwell But the numbers don’t lie: single payer systems cover more people at much lower cost and with better overall outcomes.	We can stick our heads in the sand and pretend it isn’t so but it’s cutting off our noses to spite our faces.
@rowdyrr9 @jgjolmesli @SenatorCantwell I didn’t say it sucked: I’m saying it’s imperfect.	Other countries solve this problem by having a single payer system. We don’t do that purely because one side of the aisle has an ideological opposition to it.
@jgjolmesli @rowdyrr9 @SenatorCantwell You need a trifecta of components: plans that meet a minimum coverage standard, an individual mandate to avoid free riding, and you need a subsidy system to support those who can’t afford it.
@jgjolmesli @rowdyrr9 @SenatorCantwell I’m not arguing that some people’s costs haven’t gone up. The ACA is filled with compromises, many of which Liberals dislike. The plan itself was a conservative model to keep healthcare based solely on free market principles.
@rowdyrr9 @SenatorCantwell Any way you want to slice it, you are getting royally screwed by the healthcare system.
@rowdyrr9 @SenatorCantwell 18% uninsured is not “fine” and costs per capita are more than double the OECD average and we don’t live any longer on average.	ACA halved the number of uninsured.	As for costs: ~20% of private insurance premiums go to Admin.	Admin costs for Medicare/Medicaid are ~3%.
@joeyinthewoods @rowdyrr9 @SenatorCantwell Umm...I think you missed the point. You’re *not* paying for just your family: your premiums include the cost of subsidizing the uninsured person who uses an ER and that cost is massive.
@rowdyrr9 @SenatorCantwell It is literally cheaper for the insured to pay the insurance premiums of the uninsured.	#MedicareForAll
@rowdyrr9 @SenatorCantwell This is basic healthcare economics: when people don’t have insurance, they don’t have preventive care. An ER can’t turn an uninsured patient away and it is *the most expensive* delivery component in our healthcare system. The insured pay for that. 1/

@RepMattGaetz After but not because of.
@MajestyMagazine @PatriciaTreble Upon his arrival, HM remarked “You’ll have had yer tea, then.”		But he didn’t take the hint.
@SteveScalise I’m looking for your tweet condemning Russian interference in our election process and your continuing support for Mueller and the great work he is doing to bring those responsible to justice.
@markiepinter @parscale @trumps_feed I came here to make this observation. Thanks. :)
@DevinNunes How come your report didn’t result in 12 Russians being indicted?
@CoryBooker “Presidential malpractice” sounds kind of serious.		But if we’ve learned anything from 45 it’s that norms don’t matter. If it’s not written down somewhere, neither he nor the Republicans give a damn.	#VOTE
@piersmorgan @trumps_feed Access journalism at its finest.
@IngrahamAngle @trumps_feed Wait. One minute you’re yelling at Mueller to hurry the hell up and wrap this thing up and now you want to slow it down?	Make your fucking minds up.
@OldSchoolSaul @trumps_feed Yeah, that’s definitely what you should take away from that experience.
@DoraDoubleDD @Pug_life_4_Blue @keithmac273 @FoxNews That reminds me, I haven’t seen an update on #pizzagate in a while.
@SteveScalise Did he ask what you’re doing to stop the Trump administration from making the planet uninhabitable for human life?
@RepMattGaetz Mueller is up to 35 indictments - he is getting it done.	You could make yourself useful by reuniting 3000 children with their parents.	But no: you’re talking about Hillary’s emails.	Resign, you #fecklesscцnt
@RepMarkMeadows And again the FBI racks up more indictments showing that the Russians interfered in our election.	And again you sit there stroking your chin over Hillary’s emails.	What an embarrassment.
@Pug_life_4_Blue @DoraDoubleDD @keithmac273 @FoxNews Bro, if you criticize someone for doing something and then do it yourself in spades, you’re going to get called on it.		Just own the fact your president is a gaslighting hypocrite and move on.
@NydiaVelazquez @realDonaldTrump I’m sure Vlad will say he didn’t do it.	That ought to settle it, right?
@GOPChairwoman @trumps_feed Kavanaugh’s actions speak louder than his words.		Are you just kvetching because you have a president who doesn’t read?
@keithmac273 @FoxNews This Administration is filled with the most egregious grifters in the history of our Republic but, sure, let’s criticize a man, who has spent his life serving his country, for investigating the criminals who undermined our democracy.
@Pug_life_4_Blue @DoraDoubleDD @keithmac273 @FoxNews In Dora’s defense, I believe it was the Republicans who made such a big deal about Obama’s golfing and who are now strangely silent.
@davidcicilline @realDonaldTrump There are very fine people on both sides.
@SpeakerRyan Ryan passed the #GOPTaxScam, collected large checks from his wealthiest donors and then decided to retire.		This tweet makes more sense when you realize Ryan is talking about himself.
@RepMattGaetz Nope.	We think women should be able to make decisions about their own bodies. thankyewverymuch..
@SenJohnMcCain @washingtonpost Did Donald take credit for this yet?
@RepJeffries @HouseDemocrats #CoverupCaucus - that’s a perfect description for these clowns.
@RepMattGaetz You’re in no position to tell anyone how to do their job.	Are you helping reunite 3000 children with their parents?	No, you clowns are still obsessed with Hillary’s emails.
@DarrellIssa @realDonaldTrump Can you point to a single piece of evidence that Strzok’s personal political views affected his professional responsibilities?	No, you can’t.	So STFU and focus on something that matters: 3000 children still not reunited with their parents.
@amyklobuchar I guess he didn’t get the #NationalDayOfCivility memo.
@Jim_Jordan Did he say that while you were interrogating him? I was too busy rolling my eyes at your deeply embarrassing performance.		Also: resign already.
@FoxNews @RepMattGaetz Translation: “How can we stop Mueller nailing Donald’s ass to the wall when Sessions won’t do what we tell him to do?”
@PoliticalShort @michellemalkin It’s easy to be self-righteous when your opponents are a bunch of stooges trying desperately to help Donald Trump obstruct justice but still failing at it. https://t.co/251gb9bAIF
@KimStrassel @michellemalkin No, the question every American should be asking is the one Ted Lieu asked: if he wanted to blow up the Trump campaign, why didn’t he just leak that Trump was being investigated?
@SenatorCantwell @senjudiciary Wait, are you saying there’s something *more important* than Hillary’s emails? https://t.co/0AEiNFyogW
@tedlieu @SecretaryRoss @realDonaldTrump @FBI @TheJusticeDept @SEC_Enforcement Wait, we still have an Office of Government Ethics? That’s so last presidency. @waltshaub would be proud.
@paulsperry_ 3000 children are still not reunited with their parents but this committee can’t stop talking about Hillary’s fucking emails.	These Republicans are an embarrassment to their constituents.
@cariwalt @paulsperry_ @Hopes119 I presume you also apply this flawless logic to Donald Trump who lied to his wife while he was banging a porn star?
@jholmesak @2centsanacre @SenDanSullivan You like a man who will make decisions about what you can or cannot do with your body?	That’s cool, I guess.
@KenCalvert We need to quickly dispel any notion that the #AbolishICE movement is about open borders.	#deliberatelyobtuse
@RepMikeJohnson Anyone want to give me odds of Donald Trump managing to be civil on “National Can’t We All Just Get Along While We Dismantle Your Democracy Day”?
@RepMarkMeadows But Cadet Bone Spurs totally deserves one, amirite? https://t.co/MU86vVowmS
@SteveScalise What’s outrageous is that 3000 children are still separated from their parents, Trump is insulting our allies and cozying up to our enemies while you still obsess over Hillary’s emails.	#fecklesscцnt
@SenateMajLdr In utterly unsurprising news we learned that Mitch McConnell enjoys putting children in cages, taking healthcare from Americans and giving large tax breaks to corporations and wealthy donors.
@GrabAmericaBack He’s used to the Fox News* method where you give the interviewer the list of questions you want to be asked.
@SBGC2C @RepMattGaetz @weartv Whoops, my mistake - looks like you’re able to attack women’s rights *and* obstruct justice in the same day. Well done.	https://t.co/ejhbdfD0TQ
@DorothyHesp @piersmorgan And how, exactly, do those bureaucrats “rule” you?
@SBGC2C @RepMattGaetz @weartv Does Donald know you’re taking a day off obstructing justice for him in order to virtue signal your pro-fetus position?
@DorothyHesp @piersmorgan Which foreigners rule the UK?	Are you talking about the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha currently occupying Buckingham Palace?
@SteveKingIA Every decent human being has a moral revulsion against Nazis.
@RepMattGaetz @RepDianeBlack So your argument is:	Since there are already some stupid laws, why not create another one?
@DailyCaller Yeah, no. https://t.co/GUhEhxd9Wu
@RepDanDonovan Won’t right wing racists also be affected by this bill? 	Oh no, wait: those are your peeps and they no longer have to wear masks in public.	#GOP #RacistScum https://t.co/ug9GaLv6dJ
@Scotttaylorva As always, the story is more complicated than it seems.	The Conservative gov’t cut NHS funding; hence longer wait times.	Also, this family now has a $330,000 medical bill (in the UK, it would be $0)	For reference, the NHS internal cost for a transplant is ~$65,000.
@SteveScalise There are two possibilities here:	You know you’re lying or you don’t know you’re lying.	Regardless, whether you’re a liar or a fool, you’re a disgrace to the people of #LA01.
@thehill "Experience tells us it will be heavily edited, not pretty, and intended to humiliate," Palin said. 		Right. Because it’s the heavy editing that makes Word Salad Lady sound dumber than a bag of hammers.
@Scotttaylorva Also amazing: 3,000 children detained in the US still not reunited with their parents (no Navy SEALs required).
@DesJarlaisTN04 ACA was not “federalized” at all.	While it’s disappointing that you don’t understand how ACA works, it’s your 750,000 constituents who suffer because of your ineptitude. #TN04 deserves better.	#MedicareForAll
@sendavidperdue Oh sure - *now* is the time to put politics aside.	#MerrickGarland
@JohnCornyn Does seem like a season finale or just a regular Apprentice episode?
@GuidoFawkes Government of the sensible &amp; nutjobs, by the incompetent, for the nutjobs.		The nutjobs are just figuring out that the government is incompetent and are losing their s**t because it turns out the sensible were right all along.
@ArthurSchwartz Remember: he wasn’t talking about the countries - he was talking about the people fleeing those countries.
@RealJamesWoods @trumps_feed Why is it a crazy comparison? 	In both cases, the children are trapped and, in both cases, the government is doing its best to reunite...	...Oh no, wait, you’re right: it’s a bad analogy.
@andrewccleary @AnnCoulter @anntensity All the Ann Coulter books were on sale?	Huh. https://t.co/oBR6L6RR8W
@charliekirk11 [citation needed]
@greta @trumps_feed Spoiler alert: Fox has not “moved on”.	It’s still the same red meat quasi-entertainment channel it’s always been.
@FinancialTimes “raising doubts”??	No one who has spent more than 3 minutes studying NK history thought NK was serious about denuclearization.	Literally no one.
@realDonaldTrump Since you have no clue how to reunite children in cages with their parents, I highly doubt the Thai government came to you for help to reunite children in caves with their parents.
@SteveKingIA Men get plenty of “plugs”.	If you’re not getting many it’s either because you’re not a man... or because you’re a Nazi.
@parscale @trumps_feed Good for business != good for people.
@RepLeeZeldin Zeldin insults his opponents to distract constituents from the fact he &amp; his party are planning to steal from Medicare &amp; Social Security to pay for the #GOPTaxScam.
@DonJBacon You’re letting ideology cloud your judgment.	After 8 years of trying to “repeal &amp; replace” ACA, it’s clear Republicans have no solutions for our healthcare system.	None.	Your constituents can’t wait any longer. 	#MedicareForAll
@RepLeeZeldin Zeldin has to attack his opponents to deflect from the fact that his president is trying to take away his constituents’ health care and he’s doing nothing about it.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed Should we put the Nobel on ice?
@SidsBooks @Elitism @simon_schama I always thought of him bring more “Baron Harkonnen” than that.
@man_emergency @foxandfriends “Immature” is changing your itinerary because your ego’s too fragile to behold such criticism.
@Scotttaylorva Dude, you seem to be deflecting.
@SenSchumer Does Donald need another minute?	https://t.co/XoV1pWqp3d
@dokdobluebird1 @SenSchumer Nope, nope, &amp; nope.
@IngrahamAngle @trumps_feed @thehill @realDonaldTrump To be fair, conservatism led the exodus from the #GOP.
@andrewklavan @trumps_feed I don’t know what’s more ridiculous: that we’re upset about a change to a story that never had any evidence to support it or that we believe omnipotent deities have penises.
@McConnellPress If “conservative causes” include “undermining our democracy” then, yes, he’s a rock star.
@Jacob_Rees_Mogg “The Leavers expect rainbows &amp; ponies. The future of the Conservative Party depends on our delivering rainbows &amp; ponies.”		Fixed it for you.
@Nick_Hoadley @Gingineer @GregClarkMP Congratulations: you’ve reached the same logical conclusion that every Remainer reached when they voted in the referendum.	Now we’re all agreed in that, let’s drop the whole silly idea and get on with our lives. KTHXBAI
@BillOReilly @trumps_feed Do you think we’ve all forgotten that you used to peddle this same hate...	...before your sexual harassment lawsuits caught up with you.
@joshtpm Notice he didn’t tweet this from his main @RepMattGaetz account - because he doesn’t want it to distract his followers from his daily attempts to obstruct justice on Donald Trump’s behalf.
@mattgaetz “Your honor, given the mountain of evidence against my client, how can he possibly prove he’s not guilty?”
@Jim_Jordan You’ll have to speak up. We’re being buried under an avalanche of evidence against you.	https://t.co/9JIt7VvxwO
@RepGoodlatte @HouseJudiciary @GOPoversight Children - separated from their parents and put in cages - have still not been reunited...	...but sure let’s talk some more about Hillary’s emails.		Good to know what your values are.
@seanhannity @trumps_feed A “Dem” who supported George Bush, John McCain &amp; Mitt Romney and who is not seeking re-election.	Is that the best you can do?
@FoxNewsers @trumps_feed @JesseBWatters Sorry, I can’t hear you over the sound of your glass house shattering.
@WhiteHouse @trumps_feed Has *anyone* suggested that?	No.	So STFU.
@cvpayne @trumps_feed @foxandfriends @FoxNews That’s pretty ballsy: using quote marks around “news” while going into a Fox News* studio.
@piersmorgan @trumps_feed Right - the best tactic for dealing with a bully is to be nice to him and hope he doesn’t hurt you too much.
@loriamontgomery The trip was a really bad idea but I can’t help feeling some schadenfreude seeing Republicans on the receiving end of the same tactic that US state television uses against Dems.
@Amy_Siskind To recap: MS-13 members want to come here to sell drugs...but that doesn’t pay well so they’ll need a job too...but that doesn’t pay well either so they’ll need some benefits too.

@GOPChairwoman @trumps_feed @realDonaldTrump @MattForMontana There are still 3000 children who haven’t been reunited with their parents.	What’s Donald Trump’s plan to fix that?
@megynkelly WH needs to keep its misogyny quotient as high as possible.		Shine is an excellent replacement for Rob Porter.
@kilmeade @trumps_feed @foxandfriends Normal decent people are outraged that ICE is putting children in cages...but you think calls for ICE to be reorganized is the problem?
@RepJimRenacci “will be greatly appreciated” by every American who doesn’t breathe air or drink water and who doesn’t mind the planet being made uninhabitable for humans...	...everyone else thinks he’s a climate denying shill who should never have been hired.
@kylegriffin1 Presumably he’s hiring them from Norway and not - you know - shithole countries.
@TuckerCarlson @trumps_feed Where is your evidence that they don’t still stand for these things?
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed @CharlotteReed Fox &amp; Friends’ pet is in the Oval Office so presumably they just have the WH staff crank up the AC.
@stefanlinge @_GenXChick77_ @DesireeResists @marcorubio In Karla’s defense, if your State’s general election result has to be decided by SCOTUS, you’re probably doing it wrong.
@AnnCoulter @trumps_feed Did he try asking in Muskogee?
@repdinatitus Just a reminder: he was corrupt AND dismantled regulations that protect the air we breathe and the water we drink.		His replacement will still be doing the latter so we cannot rest on our laurels for one second.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed @davidwebbshow @davidburstein I hope you have an answer to this question because Donald will need his talking points from you in the morning.
@MarshaBlackburn Congratulations: you win the Manufactured Outrage Of The Day award.		However, it’s not enough to distract us from your support for the #GOPTaxScam, your support for taking away people’s healthcare and your support for a corrupt President who puts children in cages.
@RepThomasMassie @LibertyCliff The only way an entrepreneur can run a startup with $0 income is by burning through capital.		You know a lot of poor people sitting on piles of cash?
@RealJamesWoods What’s the point of this post?	Are you virtue signaling?
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed What’s Korean for “never”?		Also, Donald comes to you for answers not questions.
@ToddPiro @trumps_feed @foxandfriends @FoxFriendsFirst You are truly the “MSM”.

@AnnCoulter @trumps_feed And of the 90% how many brag about being great writers?
@ericbolling On the contrary, it’s unpatriotic of you to think we can’t do any better than we are.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed @TomiLahren @ToddPiro promised me wall-to-wall patriotism today.	It’s not even 8AM and already you’re hating on the libs and trying to divide us.	Fail.
@TreyMcMillan83 @BeardOfRiker @JunkScience @trumps_feed This man is supposed to work for you; instead he is taking your money and using it in myriad corrupt ways.	And nobody is holding him to account for it...	...except this woman	You should be thanking her.
@JunkScience @trumps_feed Technically you’re correct:	Pruitt has no shame, ergo: he was not shamed.		That fact notwithstanding, your hyperbole is laughable.
@AnnCoulter @trumps_feed Maybe... but, to be fair, football is much more important than politics.
@SteveScalise That’s the average.	What’s the mean?
@MikeTokes @RepJeffDuncan @DevinNunes @TGowdySC @USRepLong @RepGosar @RepDaveBrat @RepMattGaetz Jim Jordan can’t even stand up to a sports doctor let alone a corrupt president.	https://t.co/mGPcz7F6NG

@FoxBusiness @DonJBacon @GroverNorquist And the top 1% of Americans have more wealth than the bottom 90%.	Something we exacerbated with our $1.2 Trillion giveaway.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed @Judgenap Trump: What’s your position on presidential self-parsons?	Judge: It’s one of my core values.
@Jim_Jordan Spinelessness seems to be a defining trait in the #GOP.	Whether it’s sexual abuse, child detention camps, a corrupt administration, or taking away people’s healthcare, he &amp; his party lack the basic moral clarity to do what’s right.	https://t.co/mGPcz7F6NG

@kelseyjharkness @ICEgov All of these things were being done by government agencies before ICE was created.		What value specifically is ICE adding?
@DonJBacon “There is nothing radical about moral clarity.” - @Ocasio2018 		Idk, bro: I’m willing to bet that plays in Peoria (or Omaha) as well as it does in Queens.
@Christo36000471 @Ocasio2018 Not against any of those things... but snatching toddlers at borders and throwing them into for-profit prisons?	Definitely.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed @Judgenap Donald has outsourced everything that involves actual reading, thinking, &amp; understanding.
@DineshDSouza @KevinMKruse It’s always fun when D’Souza runs into an actual historian. The inevitable smack down leaves him sputtering &amp; his loyal followers, embarrassed for him, don’t know quite where to look.
@mitchellreports Ahh, yes...USC31 §1352(a).	That was a good one...	...back in the day when laws... ya know... mattered.
@thehill This is the kind of confrontation @RepMaxineWaters is talking about.	Any politician that would dare question the civility of this interaction needs to answer why this mother is doing a better job of government oversight than they are.
@charliekirk11 @trumps_feed This seems like a reasonable discussion. She seems stumped by your assertion that there’s no racism because Asians &amp; Indians are doing OK... and, tbh, that’s a pretty nonsensical rebuttal.
@anntensity @trumps_feed @JasonMattera @AnnCoulter That’s a very defensive posture you have there, Ann.
@RepMattGaetz Treasonous Toad Disappointed Justice Department Wouldn’t Disclose Details Of Ongoing Investigation.
@RepMattGaetz Donald hasn’t been convicted.	Shame on you for assuming he’s guilty.

@VP @trumps_feed @SecondLady @StateDept @usembassy_quito The American people are definitely grateful.	The administration, OTOH, seems somewhat ambivalent about whether we need a State Dept.
@SteveScalise I totally agree that no one should be threatening violence.	What I also need is for you to be consistent otherwise people will question your sincerity.	Did I miss your condemnation of the nutjob in Huntsville who pulled a gun on protestors?
@Grummz All the things you’re asking for the Dems already did in ‘16.		You made a bad choice. If you don’t own that and understand *why* you did it, you’ll do it again and we can’t help you with that.		It’s up to you.

@sobidey @rinsana @IngrahamAngle Thanks but I don’t think that answers the question: why was it a bad idea to spend money when the economy was crashing but it’s a good idea to do so when it’s booming?
RT @HouseBudgetDems: .@HouseGOP’s plan:	1. Cut taxes for millionaires &amp; corporations	2. Explode deficit	3. Demand spending cuts to health &amp;…
@sobidey @rinsana @IngrahamAngle I said the report was balanced. I didn’t say I was.		Of course, if you think there’s a non-idiotic theory that explains Republicans’ thought process, I’m all ears.
@RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan HAPPENING NOW: @RepMarkMeadows &amp; @Jim_Jordan want to formally compel the DOJ to violate an individual’s right to a fair trial; to violate people’s privacy; and to compromise DOJs ability to administer justice.		Fixed it for you.
@RaheemKassam @trumps_feed @LBC @theousherwood So that’s a “no”, then?
@RepJimRenacci @FoxNews If you can point to *any* trade war that resulted in “long term gain”, I should be pleased to read about it.
@sobidey @rinsana @IngrahamAngle Here’s a pretty balanced answer to your question. 		The only real obstacle was a Republican Congress that didn’t want to spend money on a stimulus (yes, the same idiots who want tax cuts when the economy is at full employment)	https://t.co/AbinqsKtau
@thefunnymuggle @trumps_feed I believe constitutionality was already decided.	But conservatives don’t like the answer so they want some new judges.
@JohnStossel Have the wealthy donors &amp; special interests give back the $1.2 Trillion first.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed @KellyannePolls A few problems here:	1. A Kellyanne “guarantee” is as valuable as my dog’s last turd.	2. Donald doesn’t understand what “fidelity” is.	3. Donald hasn’t read the constitution.	Other than that, your golden.
@piersmorgan @trumps_feed Lots of things were “impossible to explain”... until scientists explained them.		The number of things which have been explained by evidence of a deity is still, stubbornly, zero.
@DRUDGE_REPORT @trumps_feed “Secret access”???	It’s a federal investigation.	If the NRA is involved in Russian money laundering, Mueller would be negligent if he *didn’t* look at their returns.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed If Donald Trump hadn’t instructed ICE to go around throwing toddlers in cages, maybe they could focus on actual criminals.
@DevinNunes Having to endure your corrupt douchebaggery is the highest “tax” we have to pay.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ Is there a question in there about how much your wealthy donors and special interests made off this #GOPTaxScam?
@RepLeeZeldin They *would* be risking their lives if they were allowed to go after actual criminals. 	Instead, the president whom you adore has them taking toddlers from their parents. 	Not what they signed up for, I’m sure.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed @SundayFutures Hey, @MariaBartiromo 	Didn’t @larry_kudlow lie to your face last week about the deficit falling when it’s actually rising?	Have you taken any journalism courses since then?
@charliekirk11 Congratulations: you win the Dumbest Analogy Of The Day Award.	Have a seat.
@SteveScalise And there is no excuse for your continued support of Trump’s hateful agenda.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed @MariaBartiromo The people are already upset... about an administration that uses the constitution like a doormat.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @trumps_feed From the guy who actively worked with a foreign adversary to undermine our democracy.
@exjon @trumps_feed I love how the same people who think socialism is some radical movement that will destroy America are the same ones who fully embraced the straight-up fascism of Trump without batting an eyelid.
@WeMeantWell @trumps_feed So many Republican injustices, so little time.	Did *you* at least give her some money?	Or did you just give her some bootstraps to pull herself up with while she’s waiting for the magical trickle down from the #GOPTaxScam
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed @ICEgov A quick reminder that ICE Agents also think ICE should be disbanded &amp; reorganized.	https://t.co/6KubTNEAok
@DailyCaller @trumps_feed Hicks promised to stop the Trump campaign’s meeting with the Russians from “getting out”.		So, yeah, I can see why Donald is bummed that the press found out.
@Scotttaylorva ICE is executing a cruel nativist policy created by this Administration.	I suppose the foot soldiers can argue they’re just following orders.	Not sure what your excuse is.
@IngrahamAngle @trumps_feed Is “Trumpian” a language now?		Because Warren’s statement is clearly in English and requires no translation for any normal English speaker.
@Telegraph Not only are corporations allowed to take a political stance, Citizens United permits them to throw vast amounts of money at politicians to further those political goals.
@HuntsmanAbby @trumps_feed @RealDeanCain @edhenry @foxandfriends I can’t wait to find out what policies you’ll be instructing Donald to implement tomorrow.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed @MaElviraSalazar The GOP has abandoned its conservative values and has allowed itself to be devoured by a minority Trumpist cult.	Maybe you ought to worry about that instead.

@RepPeteKing @ICEgov “Show some guts”???		Did Pete “Donald, may I please lick your boots?” King just try to ask decent Americans who are horrified at this administration’s child separation policy to show some guts?
@Rep_Hunter @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews Did you discuss the nationwide protests over this administration’s failure to reunite children they separated from their parents?
@washingtonpost Donald’s such a cuck.
@jenniferm_q I hate to be the one to break it to you but people are already starving.		https://t.co/9sEkOX4YfW
@BillOReilly @trumps_feed Even after Trump signed an Executive Order ending child-adult separations nothing has changed and there are still children in cages, forcing decent Americans to protest.		Fixed it for you.
@MarshaBlackburn There are children in cages.	History will record that you didn’t stand up for them but spent the time disparaging those who did.
@Sandie882Sandie @GeraldoRivera He’s got his hands full with French fries and a TV remote.	Making America great does not involve putting children in cages.
@GeraldoRivera @trumps_feed Dude, that’s a nice idea.	But we’re no longer doing the “beacon of liberty” “leader of the free world” “compassion” thing.	We’re now a bunch of small-minded nativists who unnecessarily inflict cruelty on the young, poor, &amp; vulnerable.
@Gemini6614 @nytimes They’re all public schools.	The difference occurs because they’re all consistently underfunded so parents make up the difference. The wealthier the neighborhood, the better the outcomes.

@KatrinaPierson @trumps_feed The administration already admitted they’re a bunch of inhumane cunts.		The question is: have they fixed the problem they created?
@HoarseWisperer There were a number of times in the Obama years where I thought Ann Coulter had jumped the shark and she was rightly shunned.	Today, she’s positively mainstream and we have much bigger sharks.
@cathymcmorris Nobody (seriously, nobody) is buying this nonsense but you keep regurgitating it.		It’s almost as if there’s a quota of BS distribution you’re required to hit every day.		Frankly, it’s insulting to the people of #WA05 - they deserve better.
@ShuffWorld @CheleFarley @darthur111 @SenGillibrand Meanwhile @realDonaldTrump has devoured the #GOP and remade it in his own nativist image. So there’s that.

@aaronecarroll Well, I looked at the photo and read her profile, which says she was an Air Force Pilot &amp; flew A-10s, (which, yes, have 30mm cannons).	I honestly just don’t get the point she’s trying to make.
@realDonaldTrump You didn’t write this tweet, did you
@SRuhle I’m sure the FNB interviewer corrected him, though. https://t.co/mv8sXw8wGl
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed @ICEgov Pro-tip: blaming someone else is usually a bad PR strategy.		The only defense ICE really has is the “we were just following orders” argument...which will work here about as well as it did at Nuremberg.		This is not rocket science: just do the right thing.
@WhiteHouse Sorry, my eyesight’s not as good as it used to be. Can you point out for me on this chart the big increase in tax revenue? https://t.co/Dvg4xMi5F7
@WalshFreedom @seanhannity It doesn’t matter. @GeorgeLakoff will tell you it’s all about being first to “frame” the issue and control the narrative.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed The guy who spent *years* leading the Benghazi investigation is suddenly impatient to wrap this one up.
@RepGoodlatte @AmericaNewsroom @FoxNews @HouseJudiciary I “tuned in” to the CSPAN feed.	The whole thing was just a masturbatory exercise in political theatre for the @FoxNews conspiracy theorists.	Where’s your “emergency” hearing for the children who have not been returned to their parents?
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed Given @realDonaldTrump hasn’t read the Constitution I’m not clear on how he’s going to recognize a “Constitutionalist” when he meets one.	https://t.co/nLCA7OM3RW
@CNNJason @RepTedDeutch @Jim_Jordan &amp; @RepMattGaetz  were laughable.		Jordan (paraphrasing): “Who should we believe: the political hacks who work for us or the Deputy Attorney General of the United States who is under oath?”
@CNNJason @RepTedDeutch He was on fire:	Jordan: “It’s not personal”	[Jordan proceeds to attack Rosenstein personally]	Rosenstein: “Thank you for making it clear it’s not personal”
@WatchingWhatYou @RepJerryNadler @bjnyc @maddow Yeah, this. @RepMattGaetz and @Jim_Jordan hammed it up for the @FoxNews crowd but you &amp; @tedlieu made it clear the whole thing was a joke and that the majority has abrogated its constitutional responsibility to deal with the real issues we’re facing.	https://t.co/nY5ozSWOZE…
@martyturd @foxandfriends @LenaEpstein It’s a private business and Trumpkins aren’t a protected class.	So...good luck with that.
@FoxNews @RepMattGaetz I watched the @cspan coverage of your “emergency” hearing. @RepJerryNadler pointed out how ridiculous it was and that was before Gaetz and @Jim_Jordan embarrassed themselves with their clownish grandstanding.	What a disgrace.	#FL01 #OH04
@marcorubio “Reality has a well-known liberal bias”
@cspan @RepMattGaetz Not sure why you’re retweeting Rosenstein calling you out for lying about what the FISA is.
@deanfv @RepMattGaetz Trump wanted a biased immoral lackey that he could depend on. He actively recruited Gaetz.  Not an accident.		Fixed it for you.
@RepMarkWalker The lie is always what comes before the word “but”.
@RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump You pledged to do whatever it takes to stop the investigation into the Trump campaign’s criminality... even if that involves abrogating your constitutional responsibility as an equal branch of government, denigrating our democratic institutions and obstructing justice.
@RepTomRice Is it Infrastructure Week?
@LouiseJune18 @brithume The courts are where everyone goes because no one can legislate.
@brexit_sham I gather that, like Brexit, the Russians helped.
@SteveKingIA Unfortunately, you’ve not been giving #IA your best which is why we happily wish for your retirement.
@TeamPelosi @LacyClayMO1 Agreed.	And Democrats have got to stop bringing pillows to a gunfight.
@FoxNews @trumps_feed @IngrahamAngle @repjoecrowley @POTUS Ingraham’s angle seems particularly obtuse this evening.
@jenniferpherris @joshtpm Almost. The goal is to make him feel good about himself.	“We’re the elite” comes first.	“You’re the elite” is the afterthought.
@SShammas27 @shala_beads @VP @POTUS It has a history of separating church and state whether you like it or not.

@foxandfriends @trumps_feed @KellyannePolls Seems to make sense.	Most employees have an annual performance review with their boss.
@RepMarkMeadows Dude, did you read that article?	It basically says your party doesn’t know WTF it’s doing.		You didn’t need Democrats to put the children in cages; you don’t need Democrats to get them out.
@megynkelly A public official is forced to face the public?	Oh the incivility!	How will our Republic survive?
@therealMJFlorio @perrygershon If you don’t think having a stated policy of taking children from their parents and putting them in cages is inhumane, I’m not sure how we can help you.
@IngrahamAngle She’s a 28 year old woman who defeated an old white guy who’s been in office for nearly 20 years and who heavily outspent her.	But sure why not just stick some label on her that triggers your audience and move on.
@leezeldin @trumps_feed Someone sounds very nervous.		But please don’t let us distract you from your attempts to obstruct justice and protect a corrupt president. I’m sure those are issues the people of #NY01 care about.
@IngrahamAngle @trumps_feed You’re confusing “sore loser” with “there’s no such thing as a Republican who acts in good faith. And don’t you forget it.”
@charlesmaynar10 @SeanMcElwee @Ocasio2018 I’m pretty confident there’s a middle ground between “no border control” and “putting children in cages”.	Why don’t you have a seat and give it some thought?
@realDonaldTrump I don’t want to speak for @Ocasio2018 but I saw her campaign and it was built on fixing for her constituents all the things that you’re breaking.		No one cares about your ego, you narcissistic clown.
@RepMattGaetz Ha! Nice try, sunshine.		We are a nation of laws and no one is above them.		For a legislator to argue otherwise is disgraceful: it’s time for you to go.		The people of #Fl01 didn’t put you there to create a king.
@SteveKingIA @CNN DO NOT CONGRATULATE NAZIS
@RepMattGaetz Oppose away, buttercup.	The Muslim ban was supposed to be for 3 months while you “fixed the vetting process”. That was 17 months ago.	Instead of doing something about it, you spent every day on Fox trying to obstruct justice.	You’re an embarrassment to the people of #FL01
@Pumped_4_Trump @JStein_WaPo Indeed.	The Democratic Party on the other hand...
@Amy_Siskind I suppose “stop lying for the administration” wasn’t an option.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed @Scaramucci Narrator: he couldn’t.
@manda_windsorae @Gizmodo @RepDonBeyer His shame gene is missing.	(Which, if you’re in this administration, is a feature not a bug)
@RepMattGaetz @washingtonpost @AP GOP wants to distract voters from the fact that they blew $1.2 trillion hole in the budget in a corporate giveaway, that they want to cut Medicare &amp; Social security, that they want to take away our health care and that they put children in cages.	Good luck with that.
@SenRonJohnson Speaking of healthcare spending, Donald Trump promised that CMS would be allowed to negotiate drug prices, saving the American taxpayer a YUGE [sic] amount of money.	How’s that going?
@RepMattGaetz @RepMaxineWaters @RepAndyBiggsAZ It takes some big brass testicles and a complete lack of self-awareness for Republicans to come up with this kind of move.	You are f***ing clown of the first order, Gaetz.
@RepRichHudson They were being told to tell the truth.	Defending dishonesty explains a lot about the Republican Party.
@MarshaBlackburn We’re already vetting them.		What other baseless arguments do you have?
@niceDonaIdTrump @GOPChairwoman “others” in this context obviously includes Donald Trump himself.	https://t.co/z5a8Kbjr95
@HoarseWisperer A question and an observation:	Q: How does the ruling affect the converse scenario where States mandate that pregnant women get counseling before having an abortion?	O: If people are searching for “abortion services”, we need to ensure that’s actually what they find.
@RossDiAnn @repjoecrowley Sooo...national security is really important unless it impedes Donald’s ability to make money.	Cool, got it.
@LacyClayMO1 The original rationale was that they just needed it for 6 months while they fix the vetting process.		They’ve had 17 months so I’m sure they’ve wrapped that process up and put a bow on it, right?
@RossDiAnn @repjoecrowley Are they the ones where the Trump Org. has important business interests?
@KenCalvert You’ve had nearly 18 months to fix whatever issues you imagine there are with the current vetting process.		What improvements have you made?
@VernBuchanan The original ban was supposed to be just for 6 months while you “fix the vetting process”.		You’re coming on 18 months since then: so WTAF have you done about it?
@RepMattGaetz @BreitbartNews “Politically-biased Lawmakers Demand Mueller Unmask Confidential Sources In Order To Obstruct Justice On Behalf Of Corrupt President”		Fixed it for you.
@RepSpeier She was not discriminated against because of her sexual orientation or because of the color of her skin.	She was discriminated against because of the content of her character.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Americans are focused on 2000 children separated from their parents &amp; put in cages.		This administration is a dumpster fire.	Your party is morally bankrupt.

@RepAndyBiggsAZ @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @DesJarlaisTN04 @RepJeffDuncan @RepMattGaetz @RepGosar @RepAndyHarrisMD @CongressmanHice @RepRalphNorman @RepScottPerry Don’t look now, Biggs, but you’ve started a witch hunt.

@DesJarlaisTN04 That was because you had your heads up your own asses.
@RepMarkMeadows Can you clarify why you want the FBI/DOJ to join your cover up team?

@Amy_Siskind Does he know the country can’t just declare bankruptcy and start over?
@ASlavitt @repsandylevin @jrovner Joe Lieberman’s name should live on in ignominy for having single-handedly screwed the American public on one of the most critical public policy issues of our time.		We should move on and pass Medicare For All...		...but no one should forget what he did.
@Tonystone61 @piersmorgan Yeah - it doesn’t work the other way around unfortunately.	Spewing “right wing bile” helps Trump.
@GOPChairwoman @trumps_feed This entire presidency is absurd.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed Not that you guys care about ethics but both Sanders and now Trump violated 5 CFR 2635.702(a).		They can criticize the Red Hen all they like as private citizens but not as public officials.
@jnet911 @TJSeraphim @parscale Tara, the MAGAts have already departed this world.	They don’t want to stay; let them go.
@TimRunsHisMouth Where can I find these “diversity training” courses of which you speak?	Because I’m embarrassed to say that I too am completely intolerant of habitual liars.
@FoxNews @RepArrington “The president is doing what he can...”	...which is not much when you realize: 	a) he hates brown people; and	b) he doesn’t know anything about the Constitution or the legislative process.
@PressSec @POTUS You are disrespectful to the American public every time you open your mouth.
@JeffFlake If the people’s representatives won’t hold this administration accountable, then the people will do it themselves.
@marklevinshow The cover highlights yet again the moral bankruptcy of the Republican Party.	I get why you’d rather we not talk about that.
@dbongino @trumps_feed Yeah, it’s annoying when people remind you of your immorality and spinelessness.
@irinaslutsky @SunTzuTech @ewwaldo @PeteSouza @waltshaub @PressSec That wouldn’t happen to be a misdemeanor, would it?
@SteveScalise @foxandfriends Did you have time to mention the big payoff you gave to your wealthy donors &amp; special interests?
@SenDeanHeller @POTUS @southpointlv It’s a bummer when Donald tells your constituents he “gutted Obamacare” and the only thing you can talk about instead is your $1.5 trillion budget-busting corporate giveaway! 	Talk about a rock and a hard place.	@RosenforNevada
@miaculpepper2 @foxandfriends “The people that I know that voted for Trump are not racist, misogynistic, or hateful”		No, but they saw his racism, misogyny, and hate and decided those weren’t deal breakers.
@charliekirk11 @JohnCornyn I found that speech but I’m struggling to find the bit where he says we should prosecute them all and put the kids in cages...	https://t.co/PdsHz0NZq8
@Scotttaylorva Yeah,	Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado CRC wouldn’t apply here because habitual liars are not a protected class.
@GOPChairwoman @trumps_feed @CNN @TIME Yeah, let’s talk some more about a magazine cover and not about the disastrous policy for which you are responsible.
@ChristineRhyner @RepMattGaetz @ZiembaDenise Still thinking about it?
@lisasolis211 @RepGoodlatte @HouseJudiciary @GOPoversight It’s gone awfully quiet. Are you still looking?
@KatrinaPierson @trumps_feed I regret to say I did miss Biff trying to divert attention from the massive humanitarian disaster his administration caused.
@lisasolis211 @RepGoodlatte @HouseJudiciary @GOPoversight Link?
@RepGoodlatte @HouseJudiciary @GOPoversight He already say he would willingly come and testify.	Did you not know that or are you just being a theatrical dick?	Don’t answer that, we already know the answer.
@Amy_Siskind I’m willing to bet if I picked any one at random from “the bin”, they’d be a better president than this cockwomble.
@ChristineRhyner @RepMattGaetz @ZiembaDenise Can you give an example of a benefit they’re receiving?	If an employer has illegally hired them, then they’re paying taxes, which your representative is spending.	But they’re not entitled to any benefits that I’m aware of.
@_BenMonroe_ @MollyJongFast @fakedansavage Fox news*
@Liz_Wheeler Riiiight. Scott Pruitt is burning through taxpayer cash like it’s going out of fashion and you’re worried about this guy?
@SteveKingIA You and Donald are tweeting your way to irrelevance. The American public overwhelmingly disagrees with you.	https://t.co/LI5tfsTE6L
@StephenMilIer In fact, Trump doesn’t value any families except his own.		Not even yours, you gormless little Nazi.
@parscale @trumps_feed Did you read the article?	To recap:	“Biff told us denuclearization had already started. The SecDef (who was sitting next to Biff) told us yesterday there was no denuclearization.”	Do you believe the SecDef or Biff, who lies an average of 6.5 times per day?
@RepThomasMassie Also overdue: your resignation.
@RepMarkMeadows Thank you for reminding us that Donald lost the popular vote BIGLY and that, therefore, he has NO mandate for any part of his agenda.	None.

@foxandfriends @trumps_feed @SteveScalise @SteveDoocy So much justice to be obstructed.	So little time.
@JohnCornyn You’re always dividing, John.	You have nothing to say about how you’re solving problems for your constituents - you just whine about your political opponents.	The people of #Texas don’t have time for whiners.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed Is there a collective noun for MAGAts?	An “infestation”, perhaps?
@RepBrendanBoyle Agreed. As with most things, it’s usually more effective (&amp; cheaper!) to address the cause of a problem than to deal with its effects.
@realDonaldTrump @PeteStauber If your Twitter profile is anything to go by, the 10,000 were all bots.
@LouDobbs @RepMattGaetz Must they, though?	Seems like it would be cheaper &amp; easier for everyone if you just left the country, Lou.
@RepLeeZeldin It’s easier to negotiate with North Korea when you give them concessions and don’t ask for anything in return.
@RepMattGaetz If the FBI was in the tank for Hillary don’t you think someone would’ve leaked that Trump was being investigated?		I suggest you actually *read* the whole IG report or have someone who can read do it for you.
@Scotttaylorva Also overdue: your resignation.
@JohnCornyn How about you worry more about getting children out of cages and less about "playbooks”?	Do your job.
@RepMarkMeadows Did you guys do something in May to cause this problem? No, you didn’t. The Executive Branch did.	So the Executive Branch can UNDO it.	This is not rocket science.
@chrislhayes @giufuliafa Also, since the administration is suddenly all about “we’re just enforcing the law” “our hands are tied” - a quick reminder of things that *are* a felony: lying on your SF-86. 	https://t.co/sYNmvdj5t9

@MarshaBlackburn @realDonaldTrump No, it won’t.	And you’re deceiving your constituents if you suggest otherwise.	Go speak to a healthcare economist and then maybe you won’t sound like an idiot.

@JuddLegum I don’t think we can rule out the possibility that Ingraham does actually put her own children in a cage for the summer.
@michaelcburgess The Republican bills don’t address the problem.	You are literally taking hostages and handing out a list of demands.	Decent human beings in Congress are signing up to the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct	Why not be one of them?
@RepMattGaetz @FoxNews Are you demanding the names of the anti-Clinton FBI employees?	https://t.co/tW65EgSxno
@rachel_witkin @JoaquinCastrotx Reality has a well-known liberal bias.
@ddale8 I suppose there are 2 options:	1. She saw Trump’s tweet, Googled the answer and then lied at the briefing; or	2. She literally did nothing all day except workshop the separation BS answers with Nielsen.
@Scotttaylorva The House Republicans’ bill doesn’t even address the problem. So even if Democrats agree to your list of demands, there is no guarantee you will release the children you’ve taken hostage.	#FamilesBelongTogether 	#DontNegotiateWithTerrorists
@Logic1946 @LACaldwellDC @MeetThePress PS: the reason we know Republicans are immoral is because there is already a bill to address this problem - S.3036 - that has overwhelming Democratic support and exactly 0 (zero) Republicans have signed up to co-sponsor it.
@LACaldwellDC @RepGeneGreen Serious question: does the Republican proposed legislation even address this specific problem?
@Logic1946 @LACaldwellDC @MeetThePress You’re right: Democrats should’ve predicted that Republicans would behave like a bunch of immoral cûnts.	Our bad.
@RosLehtinen @MylanNews @CWSoftballGame Very nice.	How about you also be a proud sponsor of S.3036 and help undo the administration’s atrocious policy of separating families?	#FamiliesBelongTogther

@RepMattGaetz Can they help with connecting parents with their government-kidnapped children?
@FP_Nerd @sam_vinograd @realDonaldTrump @politico Additionally, he gave up the role of “leader of the free world” to her, which is also possibly why he has his tighty whities in a bunch.
@RepMattGaetz Matty,	Is it true that, if you were paid enough money, you’d consider working for your #FL01 constituents instead of shilling for Trump on Fox every day?	#Fecklesscûnt
@joshtpm Maybe they’re A/B testing to see what works best.
@judekels18 @RCamposDuffy @johnlegend Yeah, taking kids as hostage in order to force Congress to build a wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for is the first bad thing Donald Trump has done.	smh
@DesJarlaisTN04 @realDonaldTrump @Comey That’s not how it works, sunshine. He told us in a TV Interview that he fired Comey in order to obstruct justice.	Are you pretending that interview didn’t happen?
@DesJarlaisTN04 Is your adoration for Donald Trump the reason why you’re helping him obstruct justice?
@LilaGraceRose Still no correction for this tweet?	#FactsMatter
@JohnCornyn There’s a bill on the table right now; every Democrat has signed up for it. What’s stopping you?	Are you serious about solving this problem or are you just a feckless c*nt?

@JohnCornyn @GeaniewmW What does Geanie think about children being taken from their parents and thrown into detention camps? 	If she were in your position would she do something or would she sit on her hands like you?
@RepMattGaetz @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @seanhannity Are you apologizing to your #FL01 constituents because the IG’s report exposed your big lie?
@SenJoniErnst @realDonaldTrump The list of things this administration dismantles without having a replacement plan is neverending. 	WOTUS adds no new regulation; it clarifies the scope of the CWA. Undoing it will adversely affect the drinking water sources of 117 million Americans.
@RepJayapal @realDonaldTrump A minute ago he was telling us how he’s above the law; now he’s telling us he’s powerless to reverse a policy he himself put in place.
@RepMattGaetz Donald Trump never fought for us but you seem to be bending over backwards to fight for him.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ Fridays are for corrupt presidential campaign managers going to jail.
@DevinNunes @IngrahamAngle Every day *you* try to help Donald Trump obstruct justice.

@RepAndyHarrisMD @POTUS Looks like the New York Attorney General sent him a present.	https://t.co/PjxvMaz4EI
@BillCassidy Why waste time when you’re hell bent on dismantling the whole thing?	Far easier to boot you out of office and do what we should’ve done in the first place: Medicare for all.
@_MicheleRZ I wouldn’t beat yourself up about it: it’s a rarity on Twitter to find someone who knows WTF they’re talking about. Weirdly, your erroneous argument unearthed a gem and we all got educated - including the smug ones piling on. Embrace it &amp; move on.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows Of course you did.	Not a day goes by without you doing your bit to help Donald obstruct justice.	What are you doing for the people of #AZ05?
@cathymcmorris @sandyhook And your part is to legislate.		Are you going to stand up to the NRA or not?

@StruxMel @CJsRebellion @PressSec @CBSNews @POTUS I’m not clear on the message here. Because Donald Trump won an election, we shouldn’t criticize him or his Press Secretary for their habitual lying? Please explain.
@JohnnyPublic3 @donna_1004 @SBGC2C @RepMattGaetz @weartv @DevinNunes I’m afraid Donna is right.	Yer boy Matty is on the Trump train and he sees it heading towards the precipice. He can’t stop it and he can’t get off it.	He’s screwed and he knows it.

@sendavidperdue @POTUS Donald only worries about one “winner”: himself.
@sendavidperdue Define “working”.
@nytopinion @NickKristof It seems worse than the Iran deal and that was, apparently, “a horrible, one-sided deal”.
@RoyBlunt @SenateMajLdr Serving whom?
@SteveScalise Right. A bias against bigotry. That’s the problem.
@Obknoxus @SarahJoyAdams @JosephDalfonzo @lizcgoodwin This is simply untrue on all counts.	Stop making excuses.	The Administration has the power to put a stop to this today but CHOOSES not to.
@RepByrne @OfficialMissUS I trust she has more enlightened views on our society than you do. 	I realize that’s a low bar, given you’re the guy who endorsed Roy Moore.
@seanhannity @trumps_feed I presume you’ll be giving Donald tips in your evening call to him via his unsecured phone line that the North Koreans and Chinese are definitely not monitoring.
@RepMikeRogersAL @SteveScalise Why do you believe something with no evidence to support it, while denying climate change, which is supported by volumes of scientific evidence?
@GOPChairwoman @trumps_feed @realDonaldTrump A little late to clutch your pearls over some bad language, isn’t it?	Also, millions are benefiting from the Obama economy.
@DRUDGE_REPORT @trumps_feed Dinesh has to sing for his supper.
@SecPompeo @trumps_feed @StateDept Is there anyone left at State who knows a damn thing about the Korean Peninsula? Serious question.

@justmy_luck @Scotttaylorva More of an assertion than an observation.
@justmy_luck @Scotttaylorva Well, that’s not much of an answer. But if it helps you sleep at night, sure.
@justmy_luck @Scotttaylorva Nope, didn’t miss that fact; I’m not a fan of quantitative easing either; a government stimulus would’ve been way more effective but Republicans refused, because...ideology!

@foxandfriends @trumps_feed “prepares”?	Are you sure about that?
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed I believe both teams already said they wouldn’t go.	Saying he wouldn’t invite them seems irrelevant.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ Maybe you’d have more credibility on this topic if you hadn’t voted for a $1.5 TRILLION giveaway for your wealthy donors &amp; special interests.	#GOPTaxScam
@GOPChairwoman @trumps_feed You should get your own house in order first before you try to talk about “lying”.	Otherwise, everyone just thinks you’re an idiot.
@nowthisnews Does this mean we should have more dogs in schools, too?	I can definitely get on board with that idea.
@CoreyJacobson @tedlieu @RepRubenGallego @EPAScottPruitt Where does “Taking the ‘Environmental Protection’ out of ‘Environmental Protection Agency’” rank on the list?
@siessdav @SteveScalise You’re welcome to your beliefs. 	My only request is that you don’t assert something you can’t prove.
@mowokyboy @03K64CantStop @SamH70394985 @DudeAbides2017 @SpeakerRyan And the #GOPTaxScam cost $1.5 trillion. So, if the zombie-eyed granny starved is right, each of those new jobs only cost $1.5m to create!
@realDonaldTrump It depends what your definition of “success” is.	I mean if allowing Iran to build nukes was your plan then, yes, you’re definitely winning.
@SteveScalise How about you ask your wealthy donors &amp; special interests to return the $1.2 TRILLION you gave them?
@RepDLamborn You voted for the #GOPTaxScam	Republicans cannot claim to be  “fiscally responsible”.	Ever.
@SteveScalise No, it’s not.	Science is real.	Doctors are real.	Thank them.
@SenateMajLdr @FaithandFreedom “Conservative principles” is an oxymoron.
@justinamash @POTUS And your vote on the #GOPTaxScam ...could you show us that for context?
@Robert_Aderholt @POTUS What a joke.	Donald may have a short memory but we do not.	You voted for the #GOPTaxScam
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump We tried to play nice: we took a Republican plan and bent over backwards to get their votes. Not only did they not vote for it, they are actively dismantling it.		Come November, no more playing nice: Medicare for all.
@dylanlscott They’re criminals but they’re not criminal masterminds.
@AnnLaabs @dylanlscott Even weirder, I’m willing to bet your #Trump voter family member has already rationalized this u-turn and has moved on.
@JimPressOffice In order to write this nonsense, you are either very stupid or you think your constituents are.	#GOPTaxScam
@FoxNews @trumps_feed @pnjaban @IngrahamAngle Do you even know what a moral compass is?
@MikeKellyPA @POTUS Obama rescued the economy and lowered unemployment for every year of his presidency. Was that accidental?	#coattails
@MarshaBlackburn Didn’t you vote for the #GOPTaxScam?	How about you sit down until someone who’s fiscally responsible shows up to sort this mess out. @Kanew
@RepMattGaetz @FBI @TheJusticeDept Don’t talk to us about shame.	You don’t know the meaning of the word.	The people of #FL01 do, though, which is why you’re being replaced.
@DineshDSouza @leggyblonde007 You are a worthless fraction of a human being and you should be begging the pardon of everyone you meet every day of your life.

@realDonaldTrump I can’t believe I’m doing this but...		@JustinTrudeau @EmmanuelMacron 		Biff is trying to wreck the Obama economy with a trade war. 	Can you talk some sense into him, please?
@DrPhilRoe @POTUS Historic - yes	Progress - notsomuch
@RepMattGaetz @trumps_feed Even your analogies are based on myths.		Also, it’s Loch Ness.
@DesJarlaisTN04 @BarackObama You’re so disingenuous.
@DesJarlaisTN04 Is 2.8% higher or lower than the 4% Donald promised?	#lower

@RepMattGaetz “against those of us in Congress who are working to help Donald obstruct justice.”		Fixed it for you.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed You guys are just pathetic. https://t.co/CNZCer0Euh
@RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump That’s not it. It’s that if you’re one of Donald’s pals, you can get a pass...	...which, in turn, sends a signal to all those indicted by Mueller: be one of Donald’s pals.
@realDonaldTrump @fema Really? How’s Puerto Rico doing, Biff?
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed @MZHemingway How crazy are things at EPA that new scandals keep delaying Pruitt getting fired?
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed @charliekirk11 Yeah, it was definitely the Eagles who wanted to politicize it. https://t.co/c306CqiXG0
@AnnCoulter @trumps_feed And we know Biff lied about his health.	In a normal world that would be a big deal.	In our banana republic, it’s called “Tuesday”.
@RepMattGaetz @HARRISFAULKNER @FoxNews @OutnumberedOT Because we haven’t discussed “her emails” enough.		How about you call an investigation into why Biff is *still* having conversations on an unsecured phone?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @trumps_feed Your fucknozzle father, Biff, canceled the Iran deal.	This is the result.
@TheHalliCJShow @JohnCornyn And they’ll get us to pay for it.
@RepTimWalz @EPAScottPruitt @realDonaldTrump Rhetorical question.
@realDonaldTrump You seem anxious, Donald.
@RepLeeZeldin Nothing can deflect us from the realization that you are an abject failure:	You’re failing the people of #NY01.	You’re failing your country.		You. Will. Be. Replaced.
@RepJohnCurtis There are no fiscal conservatives.
@rep_stevewomack You misspelled #GOPTaxScam
@RepTrentKelly Please also explain why you robbed Medicare &amp; Social Security, which the people of #MS01 paid into, in order to give $1.2 TRILLION to your wealthy donors &amp; special interests.
@seanhannity @trumps_feed Yeah. Seriously: people expect politicians to answer journalists’ questions.	I realize, as a State TV employee, you might think otherwise.

@DonaldJTrumpJr @trumps_feed Err... when you say “our problems”, are you talking about your family’s  ”legal issues”, or are you talking about the 4600 dead in PR, the 1500 lost children, $1.5T hole in the deficit, etc?	Asking for a friend.
@Michael2014abc @CalliCapone @GettinPitted A short attention span would explain a lot.
@DineshDSouza @trumps_feed You misspelled “disgusted”.
@realDonaldTrump Yeah. Because when Obama personally advised you not to hire Flynn, you totally took that advice.
@DRUDGE_REPORT @trumps_feed Also warns Weather Channel that they will be held accountable for more storms occurring in red states than blue states.
@FoxNews @trumps_feed @Scaramucci Right, because everything is always about the Clintons.

@RoniSylvester @foxandfriends @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I’m not sure you understand what the effect of a tariff is...	...but thanks for taking the time to reply.
@RoniSylvester @foxandfriends @POTUS Err...Yes, someone in this story is prone to behaving like a brat...but it’s not the CA, EU, or MX. Those countries will have a very measured response and will pick very specific targets for tariffs - like companies in weak GOP Districts.
@balescat While I don’t care for the remark, 2 points come to mind:	1. Conservatives have forfeited any right to criticize people for using vulgar language;	2. You can’t be OK with nepotism in the WH *and* expect the family to be “left out of it.”
@gillhammelvin @ajdagres @xarmynsdq @KyleKashuv @lexforchange @benshapiro @SmithWessonCorp All rights are constrained. Even 1A.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed @GeraldoRivera Liberals can make this type of criticism but Conservatives cannot.	Unfortunately, they have forfeited that right.
@IngrahamAngle @trumps_feed Dammit. And I thought laying waste to entire countries so that their citizens would be forced to flee to our shores with nothing but the shirts on their backs was a win/win for everyone.
@SteveScalise In other words: “You should fork out more of your hard-earned to cash to mitigate the consequences of my refusal to tackle Climate Change.”
@RepSteveChabot It seems Donald managed to commit an SEC violation by tipping off the market before the numbers were released. I’m sure you’ll look into that.	https://t.co/FSMXIhHN7F

@Qtastic3 @A_Smart_Liberal @DonaldJTrumpJr @Google Not sure why this is so hard to grasp:	1. Insert Nazism on CAGOP Wiki page	2. Search Google for CAGOP.	3. Google fetches Wiki page info	4. Remove Nazism from Wiki page.
@Qtastic3 @A_Smart_Liberal @DonaldJTrumpJr @Google Bro, you didn’t comprehend the article. It’s not in Wikipedia now but it was.
@GOPChairwoman @trumps_feed Is there some mental defect in Republicans that prevents them understanding how Google or Wikipedia work?
@Surabees @trumps_feed @DonaldJTrumpJr I stopped reading after the first statement which is demonstrably false.
@seanhannity @trumps_feed When Sean gets up from the fainting couch and stops clutching his pearls, would someone explain to him how Wikipedia works?

@Kittens4milk @right4what @IreneBr97053646 @DineshDSouza @PPFA No, he’s really not.

He strings together some random words: PPFA &gt; Sanger &gt; Eugenics &gt; Nazis and lets you draw the incorrect conclusion.
@Debber66 @DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump @SenTedCruz I guess, when you’re a Trump loyalist, laws don’t apply.

@dbongino @trumps_feed Dude, every time Giuliani opens his mouth he incriminates his client. Democrats want him *on* the air as often as possible.

@realDonaldTrump Democrats want to repeal the tax cut for the top 1% to pay for a raise for teachers.		Go ahead: I dare you to veto it.
@foxandfriends @trumps_feed Fact.

@GOPChairwoman @trumps_feed @MonicaCrowley Fact: Trump’s campaign was staffed by criminals.	No amount of spin can undo that and every time you try to defend or deflect just makes you look more ridiculous.
@TuckerCarlson @trumps_feed Do you have a link for that interview?	Because I’m not aware of any serious assertion that Russia’s interference changed the outcome of the election. 	It may have but I agree that’s very difficult to prove.
@JohnCornyn So if I say there is no evidence you’re sleeping with a prostitute, is that just spin?
@FoxBusiness @RepSteveChabot @POTUS He hadn’t prepared for the meeting and he felt slighted by Kim Jong Un.	Let’s be honest he canceled because he’s narcissistic and lazy.
@ericbolling @trumps_feed @realDonaldTrump DACA, the wall, cheaper healthcare for all, trade with China, TPP, NAFTA...and now North Korea.	Trump hasn’t cut a single deal yet.	Not one.

@BravoLima78 @TensionFilter @ATexanDemocrat @LynnePatton @KatrinaPierson @FBI @realDonaldTrump @Cernovich @TheDemocrats @NancyPelosi @RepMaxineWaters @DiamondandSilk @SenSchumer @ChrisCuomo @jaketapper Either the FBI was actively trying to help the Democratic candidate or it wasn’t.

@BravoLima78 @TensionFilter @ATexanDemocrat @LynnePatton @KatrinaPierson @FBI @realDonaldTrump @Cernovich @TheDemocrats @NancyPelosi @RepMaxineWaters @DiamondandSilk @SenSchumer @ChrisCuomo @jaketapper Yeah, they really helped her win the election.

@jargonijagon @RepLeeZeldin Agreed. I’m merely noting that it was the *suspicion* of criminal activity that triggered the investigation. You’re correct that the investigation has since uncovered actual criminality.
@RepLeeZeldin The investigation was not launched because Donald was the GOP nominee.	It was launched because the GOP nominee’s campaign was allegedly committing crimes.

@RepLeeZeldin Wow. Such ignorance and flippancy.	Not the attributes the people of #NY01 expect from their Representative.
@washingtonpost As far as I can tell, this is the last time he referred to Melania as “my wife”: https://t.co/uWWBbktdTY
@SenTedCruz @KPRC2 So, to recap: Republicans think the Israelis are our friends and the Palestinians are our enemies?	Got it.
@danpfeiffer The “airbrushing” of the speech notwithstanding, I can’t help but notice that it’s the Trump Administration’s decision to move the embassy that has “provoked the violence”.
@LI_Conservative @BrockWolf6 @SeeMeESP @RepLeeZeldin @realDonaldTrump Do you have any evidence they are violating the deal?	From all the reports I’ve seen they are complying.
@Bls1022 @frstborn @RepMarkMeadows Mueller does not do anything “for show”.
@RepMarkMeadows You blew a trillion dollars on special interests &amp; wealthy donors, with no evidence that it would help average Americans.		I suggest you STFU and let the career professional investigators  do their jobs.
@cathymcmorris Try speaking to regular people instead of just your rich donors &amp; special interests.
@sendavidperdue You rubber-stamped the initial set of nominees and they all either a) wrecked the depts. they were appointed to lead; b) were corrupt AF; or c) quit.	Maybe you could exercise some actual due diligence this time?
@RepMarkMeadows DACA, ACA, Paris Agreement, TPP, Iran.	Donald breaks deals every day.	He fails miserably when it comes to making new ones.	He has no plan.	But we have a plan to replace you.
@OfficeOfMike @trumps_feed @JesseBWatters It’s clear you’re unfamiliar with the terms of the Iran deal.	Maybe you should read it first?
@RepMattGaetz You spent one TRILLION dollars on rich donors and special interests.	Is there some new definition of “curbing wasteful spending” that the rest of us are unaware of?
@SpeakerRyan Wait. You’re saying your tax cuts aren’t paying for themselves? What happened to trickle down?	#GOPTaxScam
@RepJasonSmith This tweet is a complete and utter lie.	Your inability to stand up to a fool who breaks a deal like this on a whim is an abrogation of your constitutional responsibility.	You will be replaced.
@KeithRothfus The goal was to give rich donors and special interests shedloads of money and give the plebs just enough in the hope they wouldn’t notice.	But we see you and we see through you.	Pack your bags.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @LouDobbs @FoxBusiness Everything about this tweet is laughable: Biggs, Dobbs, Fox Business, witch hunt.	When you get fired in November, you should definitely consider hitting the comedy circuit.
@RepMattGaetz If you ever decide *not* to “fully support the Trump administration”, let us know. Otherwise, you’re just wasting internet bandwidth.
@RepByrne He knows his scope is limited.	When the crimes he uncovers are beyond his remit, he refers them to the relevant authorities. (see: Cohen, Michael)
@SteveScalise @DevinNunes If the House Intel Cttee investigation is anything to go by, Nunes wouldn’t recognize a serious question if it knocked him down in the street and danced an Irish jig on his face.
@RepMattGaetz Simple, you are.	Fair, you are not.	Fired, you will be.
@RepLeeZeldin @jeffsessions He lied under oath about meeting the ambassador of a foreign adversary that interfered in our election.	That you didn’t demand his resignation on the spot is incredible and one of the many reasons the voters of #NY01 are going to replace you.
@wolfganggreen1 @ToddRokita @LouDobbs @FoxBusiness Of being WITCHES, of course.
@ToddRokita @LouDobbs @FoxBusiness In case you’ve not been keeping track, Mueller has so far found 19 WITCHES and 5 WITCHES have pleaded guilty.
@Scotttaylorva @USATODAY Are you saying that lots of gun owners can't be relied upon to be law abiding citizens?
@WeMeantWell Sure, they can choose whether they have moral standards or not.	But if they choose the latter, they’re done. That’s their “sine qua non”: there’s no coming back from that choice.	Ever.
@ToddRokita Mueller (so far): 19 indictments and 5 guilty pleas.	House Investigation: Nothing.	How about you STFU and leave this to the professionals?
@seanhannity @trumps_feed Criminal’s lawyer and criminal’s confidant want investigator to stop investigating crimes.	Got it.
@nrlc Why do you ask for prayers?	Wouldn’t praying for prayers be more effective?
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Spoiler alert: medical science saved your life.
@mkraju I believe, instead of investigating, the House and Senate *actually* went fishing.
@alexandertickle @RepMattGaetz And those ten are probably all bots. But fortunately I’m not here for the validation - the tweet was just for you, petal.
@alexandertickle @RepMattGaetz That works out for both of you... because your congressman loves being on TV.

@RepLeeZeldin If the Iranians were subcontractors on a Trump hotel project, your cute slogan might apply.	But we’re talking about nuclear weapons: “no deal” isn’t an option and the onus is on *you* to get a better deal than the one we have.
@ConMillenial1 @MarlaCaldwell @jscowdin And your point is...?
@RepMarkMeadows Wow, you guys are really just mailing it in these days.	You can’t be bothered to act as an equal branch of government and you have no appetite for oversight when it’s a member of your own tribe.	Pitiful.	Do you dislike Mueller because his work ethic puts you to shame?
@ConMillenial1 @MarlaCaldwell @jscowdin Yes: he’s considerably more diligent and conscientious than the House Intelligence Committee.
@LouDobbs @RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump “Liar &amp; Leaker- @realDonaldTrump”		Freudian slip?
@RepMarkMeadows Err...Comey was briefing the person who was the subject of the dossier. Surely Trump knows if its contents are real or not?
@RepLeeZeldin Yeah, you’re right. I’m sure voters don’t care if you rubber stamp every nut job Trump nominates.
@ConMillenial1 @MarlaCaldwell @jscowdin Patience, my young padawan. Nobody thinks this is a game.	Mueller is as diligent &amp; conscientious as they come.
@VOANews @trumps_feed To avoid extradition?
@RepMattGaetz Any chance you’re going to start working for the people of #FL01?	I don’t think they hired you to undermine our democratic institutions.
@RepLeeZeldin @LouDobbs @FoxBusiness @jeffsessions Sounds like you’ve joined the conspiracy to obstruct justice.	I certainly hope your constituents get the satisfaction of firing you before Mueller gets a hold of you.
@Auntdiggie12 @RepLeeZeldin @KurtSchlichter @RichardGrenell @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton Only if you can spell it correctly.
@ProgressOutlook @FoxNews @RepMattGaetz He may as well be in AZ. This clown is so busy carrying water for Donald and undermining our democratic institutions, he has no time for the people of #FL01.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ You should send Obama a thank you card.
@ZaushD @RepThomasMassie @realDonaldTrump I think you’re giving Trump too much credit. He doesn’t care about the details: he just regurgitates the last thing he heard.

@cathymcmorris How does it compare to the $1,300,000,000.00 you gave to your wealthy donors and special interests?
@AltheDentist @peersja @BillOReilly People who say a thing is impossible are invariably interrupted by someone doing it.
@Mellyitalia @realDonaldTrump @NRA Yeah, that was yesterday. Today he’s doing the NRA’s bidding.	Do try to keep up.
@realDonaldTrump @NRA You wouldn’t know what “the right thing” was if it knocked you over on the street and danced an Irish jig on your face.
@petecoen @davidaxelrod We don’t have more mental illness than other countries which tells us that tackling that alone won’t solve the problem. But it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do more to tackle mental illness.	https://t.co/07TwlsQ8LI
@RepMarkMeadows Your president said he would take care of the DREAMers. You seem to be doing a bang up job of dancing around that.
@SenatorLankford You should focus on the cleanest bill that protects the #DREAMers. Partisan debate about immigration can wait; the DREAMers cannot.	Get it done.
@AustinScottGA08 You might make a good preacher... but your job is to legislate. #guncontrol
@RepMikeRogersAL Your #thoughtsandprayers don’t work. They’ve never worked.	But the good news is we don’t need them: *you* have the power to fix this. You’re a legislator. Legislate.
@RepMoBrooks Didn’t you just vote to give your donors &amp; special interests $1.5T?
@WhiteHouse @trumps_feed @PressSec @USDOT He could contribute significantly more by paying some taxes.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ No. Republicans promised an open bipartisan process to pass legislation for DREAMers. The sanctuary city amendment is irrelevant and is the definition of a partisan political wedge.	Once again: Republicans acting in bad faith.
@SenatorEnzi @BudgetGOP @POTUS Given you just got done adding $1.5T to the debt, I find your sudden concern for fiscal responsibility unconvincing.
@RepMattGaetz If you were hoping for a fiscal responsibility award, I’m afraid that ship has already sailed, sunshine.		Now be a good chap, run and fetch Donald another Diet Coke.
@RepDLamborn @realDonaldTrump Public broadcasting is a tiny fraction of the federal budget but the value it delivers is enormous. It’s not clear what value you’re delivering, if any.	https://t.co/VVjkA07DcE
@seanhannity State media already reported it was non-hazardous an hour ago.	Do try to keep up.
@RepMarkMeadows The party of morality, of family values, of fiscal responsibility, of law &amp; order? You gave all that up. The Democrats are the only adults left in the room.
@RepMarkMeadows $23M for 28,000 workers is ~$800 each. One time. 	If you really wanted to help millions of workers, you could’ve just raised the minimum wage.
@MarshaBlackburn There isn’t one “queue”. There are different paths to citizenship and your job as a legislator is to create a path for the DREAMers.	Your apathy towards them is disturbing.	Change your attitude and do your job...or be replaced.
@RepMattGaetz ...and because you’re desperately trying to curry favor with a man who wants to cover up his crimes.
@RepMattGaetz Does your mother know you’re on the internet?
@SenateMajLdr Sad that you have to be explicit about that and that it’s not your default position on all legislation...	...the worst part is: we *still* won’t believe you until the ink is dry.
@chikkiepotpie @KathyKro722 @RepMattGaetz @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews For there to be a counter-argument, one must first make an argument.
@RepMattGaetz You couldn’t investigate your own belly button.
@chikkiepotpie @KathyKro722 @RepMattGaetz @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews It’s the Democratic Party.
@RepLeeZeldin @NancyPelosi What Republicans know about bipartisanship would fit on the back of a 5¢ stamp.
@realDonaldTrump SQUIRREL!! https://t.co/EtWoYJJ2Al
@dualisticmonist @mkraju Isn’t my popcorn going to get kind of soggy if I’m eating it in a storm?
@mkraju His answer makes a lot more sense when you realize he’s the one trying to kill our democracy in the darkness.
@PressSec Because you blew a $1.5T hole in the deficit and a public school secretary only got $1.50 extra a week.	Democrats would’ve written a more fiscally responsible &amp; equitable bill and you know it.
@SteveKingIA Shorter Steve King: all working women should get screwed more. Literally.
@MichaelCohen212 @RepAdamSchiff @RepSwalwell Err...that excerpt doesn’t say you never went to Prague, it says they don’t have evidence you did. 		Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
@RepMarkMeadows You could already have done that - as you did for the corporate tax cuts - but you *chose* not to.	Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to spend my extra $1.50 on a deposit for a new yacht I’ve picked out.
@RepLeeZeldin A lot of “rank &amp; file” employees at DOJ &amp; FBI are involved in preparing each FISA application. Your attempt to impugn just those leading the corruption investigation is a joke: you’re complicit AF in undermining these institutions.
@RepMcGovern @realDonaldTrump Pentagon should tell the White House it is busy defending the country and doesn’t have time for this shit.
@RepMattGaetz @thehill If you just said nothing at all, you’d be less of an embarrassment to the people of #FL01. For the love of all that is holy, sit down.
@MatthewPhillipe @RepGaramendi Maybe you forgot why we needed a stimulus?
@GigiBowman @KimAlex45630657 @RepLeeZeldin Sure. But while we’re waiting for that, you should at least consider the possibility that things are much simpler: the FISA warrants were issued because Carter Page was a Russian agent.
@MatthewPhillipe @RepGaramendi He voted against blowing a $1.5T hole in the deficit to benefit rich donors &amp; special interests. Middle class families need more help than they got and the 1% needed no help at all.
@GigiBowman @KimAlex45630657 @RepLeeZeldin And there are multiple layers of bureaucracy who have to collate &amp; vet that information before it goes before a judge. 	Yet more people, who all need to be in on it. Every time. For every application.
@KimAlex45630657 @RepLeeZeldin @GigiBowman The problem with being a conspiracy theorist is that it requires so many individually implausible things to be simultaneously true. 	Occam’s Razor tells us that’s not the way things work.
@CarolJo44 @JillayneMC @BechtelSr @joepabike @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @GetSpectrum @BrookingsInst Don’t bother, Jill. Even if you show her the data she will either a) call it “fake news”; or b) claim it’s because we have a President who puts ‘America First’.”	Let her stay in her bubble.
@KimAlex45630657 @RepLeeZeldin @GigiBowman All four of them?
@realDonaldTrump You seem anxious, Donald.
@RepLeeZeldin It is clear to everyone that this memo is a politically motivated canard. You are either complicit or a fool for promoting its publication. You owe @RepAdamSchiff &amp; your constituents an apology.
@Curmudgeon1836 @MetafauxLtd @rvbdrm @Marina_Sirtis Two things:	1. The technical name for this would be “argument from ignorance”.	2. To your point, Watergate took a couple of years so by that yardstick, Mueller may just be getting started.
@RepMattGaetz Hope is not a strategy.	Releasing factually misleading memos that undermine our nation’s law enforcement in order to rationalize Trump firing the people investigating him. 	*That* is a strategy.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Yeah, a little bit tired - we’ve now had 88 straight months of job growth. But we’re glad you’re so stoked about it - why don’t you send @BarackObama a thank you card? https://t.co/dk3ue00dXf
@mrsmpie @businessinsider Really? Because I hear he has impeccable credentials.	https://t.co/G1ODUu3aVb
@RealSheriffJoe The WaPo calls shenanigans on your ignorance plea, Joe.	https://t.co/12awoG3TGa
@RepTomGarrett What’s troubling is pols who are willing to impugn the integrity of career public servants in order to protect a President.		That doesn’t sound like a hill you want to die on.		Focus instead on your constituents’ needs... or be replaced.
@KKG2315 @nameredacted5 @Comfynumb15 @carl5480 @AP The statement “Donald was elected President” contains “no inaccuracies”. But not telling you he had help from a foreign adversary might be “a material omission that fundamentally impacts the accuracy” of the statement.
@SenWhitehouse @POTUS He loves the clapping. He needs the clapping. So much clapping.
@RepBrianMast Just curious: which God thinks it’s OK for a man who sexually assaults women to be President?
@RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump Partners in crime. Literally.
@Scavino45 “Among speech watchers”.		Some of us were unable to watch due to a prior engagement. 		I had to rearrange my sock drawer.
@RepMattGaetz @trish_regan @FoxBusiness I thought Donald was supposed to release your BS memo during the #SOTU?	I guess that means you just have to do more whoring for him on TV.	No rest for the wicked.
@SenRonJohnson @realDonaldTrump Tammy sat on her hands because that was what we all agreed at the secret society meeting.
@senrobportman You just added $1.5T to the national debt in order to pay your rich donors &amp; special interests.	And now you’re magically going to find $1.5T for infrastructure?
@briiianbear @DWStweets Yeah, he really sucked at handling the economy. https://t.co/TE1hHv5M7b
@ovrtaxdundrpaid @paulkrugman The umpteenth time someone who doesn’t understand Keynesian economics makes a fool of themselves.
@RepMattGaetz @LouDobbs @FoxBusiness Sorry, I didn’t catch what you said there. Would you mind repeating it without Donald’s penis in your mouth?
@seanmdav How close must the FBI be to nailing Trump’s ass to the wall that Republicans feel the need to force McCabe out only a month before his retirement?
@RepMattGaetz If you worked half as hard for the people of #FL01 as you do trying to undermine our nation’s law enforcement, you’d have no trouble getting re-elected.		But you don’t, which is why we’re replacing you. @PhilEhr https://t.co/J9pvSXPtM5
@FoxBusiness @RepMattGaetz Why don’t you have a seat: you must be exhausted carrying all that water for Donald.
@RepDaveJoyce @realDonaldTrump You forgot the air quotes around “information”.
@RepMarkMeadows I look forward to seeing your proposal for reasonable gun control laws.
@TomiLahren Is “American people” some nickname Trump has for his own wallet?
@seanhannity Will there be another awesome car chase?
@brandon_r_horan @cakehler @Comey You missed the bit about Nunes being on the transition team of the campaign that’s being investigated by the Agency he’s trying to undermine with a memo he wrote.
@JackPosobiec Yes, dumbass. Because Nunes, who has less integrity than one of my bowel movements after a dodgy curry, wrote a “memo” that makes claims based upon evidence that we are not allowed to see.
@RepMarkMeadows Are you also calling for the release of the underlying surveillance upon which this chicken scratch is based?
@RepMattGaetz The only person you’re fighting for is the moron in the Oval Office and the only things you’re exposing are your ignorance and willingness to put your party before your country.	https://t.co/J9pvSXPtM5
@mybadge @MaryAbrahams @FMoniteau @HillaryClinton “flawed human”. 		Wow.
@sendavidperdue @foxandfriends @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Pro-tip: People will know you’re lying if you use “brilliant” and @realDonaldTrump in the same sentence.
@piersmorgan Since everyone is already saying that, how will anyone know you actually popped yer clogs? 	(Other than the IQ of your viewers suddenly going up 20 points)
@EyedullMinds @Mandy_Rabble @AnnCoulter @trumps_feed Do we think it’s right that children should have to pay for the crimes of their parents?
@MarrShow @piersmorgan Alliances are built on shared values. The majority of Americans want to know that the majority of Britons share their values and not the minority views of the nativist kleptocrat who currently occupies the Oval Office.
@texasdad5 @gunderwood3 @jwdickerson @RepAdamSchiff @POTUS  https://t.co/J1u6QVEuYq
@FLYER995 @PetrouDino @RepMarkMeadows The memo is a nothingburger, which is why it’s never getting released. Trump could see the memo today.	But DoJ and Senate Intel Cttee have seen the intel it’s based on, so the second it’s out, the gig is up.
@JohnCornyn @WSJopinion Did the 1% need a “growth boost”?
@JohnCornyn @politico Like the rest of us, he wants a better solution than the sh*t sandwich Donald is offering.
@cl_meeker @mscherer0902 @SenateGOP @SpeakerRyan @NancyPelosi Serious question: will you get that every year? Asking because the corp tax cuts are permanent and I believe the individual ones are not.
@JohnCornyn “Generous” would be a clean DACA bill. How about you suggest that?
@AnnCoulter From the same Harvard poll you posted yesterday, 77% said they thought Dreamers should be given a path to citizenship. That doesn’t sound like a lot of hate to me. https://t.co/NBhuKBxvUJ
@RepMattGaetz @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Don’t forget your tinfoil hats.
@ltrickford @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Dear Lord, thank you for giving us a President who sexually assaults women, who bangs porn stars after his 3rd wife has given birth to his 5th child, who’s a flat out racist and a narcissistic kleptocrat. We are truly blessed.
@RepMattGaetz There’s plenty of sunlight and transparency between your ears.
@ChrisRBarron Agreed. Trying to cover up crimes is par for the course with this Administration.		A “bombshell” would be finding out Trump was really interested in the truth about Russian interference in our electoral process.
@andrew_amarone @JohnCornyn @GOP @realDonaldTrump Giving away the store?? Democrats will reject that deal right out of the gate.	Tying it to some nativist anti-immigrant agenda is a complete non-starter.	Also they’re not paying for some dumbass wall. Ever.
@greta There is a proven way to make it work... but it involves half the country getting over an ideological hurdle.
@ericbolling @FBI @realDonaldTrump Don’t you know the rule about using “but” in a sentence?
@InhofePress @JimInhofe @joshrogin If we’re peers does that mean we’re a shithole country too?
@TuckerCarlson Sorry I wasn’t able to watch. I had to attend a #SecretSociety meeting.		Also I had to use my tinfoil hat to cover last night’s dinner.
@BillOReilly Should I use a loofah?
@h_webber @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Because the 1% needed a hand up.
@AnnCoulter It’s hard because laws and campaign promises are often not well thought out and have unintended harmful consequences that only a miserable toad would choose to inflict on others, you despicable fraction of a human being.
@cathymcmorris Shame you had to be dragged kicking &amp; screaming to the table before you would agree to do the right thing.		We hope you learn from that embarrassing debacle and approach the #DACA problem wth some empathy &amp; common sense.
@RoyBlunt Wow! 200?! That’s, like, all the companies in America! And it only cost us $1.5 trillion!	Great work, guys!
@KevinMKruse And if he wants to be taken seriously, he’s also going to need a Gohmert Flowchart ™.
@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @FBI Meanwhile, viewers will be pleased to hear that the basic competency of Fox News* as a state media outlet shilling for a corrupt kleptocracy is not in question.
@FinleyRusch @WattersonVickie @Triton102 @dbongino When are you going to learn? You’re being played.	https://t.co/lQb0MqBujm
@RepMattGaetz Well, let’s see: it’s another Republican Administration covering up its crimes. This time, though, Congressional Republicans are trying to cover them up too.		So I guess you’re right: it’s worse.
Thank you, @SenSchumer https://t.co/p7Y7uNqROL
@RepMattGaetz Anti-American bias has infected your head.
@foxandfriends @TomiLahren And take it from Tomi: she knows all about looking silly.
@JohnCornyn @WSJ I don’t see any effort amongst House Republicans to unify their warring factions, though. If the Senate actually sends over a DACA bill for them to vote on, @SpeakerRyan is going to crap his pants.
@JohnCornyn @HoustonChron Why is it so hard to get Republicans to do the right thing, to do what they promised and what the majority of Americans support? 	Stop prevaricating and pointing the finger. 		Do. Your. Job.
@RepLeeZeldin @RepLeeZeldin OTOH is a partisan hack who is more than happy to put his party before his country.
@RepLeeZeldin Reminder: Mueller is a registered Republican and has worked under R &amp; D presidents. He is so well respected the Senate passed a law (100-0) to extend his 10yr term as FBI Director by 2yrs. https://t.co/kK0f7ZkPcY
@TechQn @SenateMajLdr There must be some new definition for #fiscallyresponsible that I’m not aware of because, AFAIK, adding $1.5T to the national debt doesn’t qualify.		This $31B tax cut? Also added to the debt.
@staggerlee69 @I_like_ur_idea @liberty_latino @RandPaul I’m sure you’re a “responsible gun owner”. But I want to hear what that means in practice because just falling back on a “shall not be infringed” clause and shrugging your shoulders every time there’s a mass shooting is not an appropriate response.
@I_like_ur_idea @staggerlee69 @liberty_latino @RandPaul Guns don’t have to be banned. There are legitimate uses for them but let’s have an honest discussion about what those are.		If the ability to overthrow a tyrannical government is one of them, then let’s hear how that’s supposed to work.
@staggerlee69 @liberty_latino @RandPaul Your government has Abrams A1 tanks and tactical thermonuclear weapons. 		So have fun storming the castle.
@liberty_latino @RandPaul We have laws and three equal branches of government to prevent genocides. So we don’t need guns for that.		What other specious arguments do you have?
@SenateMajLdr What are those “thoughts”, senator?		I think we’re all curious to know what they are.		Do any of them involve actually *doing* something?
@mrgfwilliams @RepJasonSmith @realDonaldTrump IDK, shutting the government down and then funding it for 3 weeks doesn’t *sound* like a “win” to me.		But maybe I’m setting the bar too high for this President?
@RepLeeZeldin Are the 4 indictments, 2 of which resulted in guilty pleas, “ridiculous”?
@realDonaldTrump Pro-tip: if you cause the shutdown, you can end it. #TrumpShutdown
@LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump Spoiler Alert: there are millions of us. All working against Trump. Seriously, you should look it up: we have protests &amp; marches and we call our Representatives on a regular basis.
@TomStratton11 @Tshirtbordello @johncardillo Oh, my apologies. Did they not cover that story on state-run TV?
@MichaelCohen212 @FBI @nypost I can’t believe you take the New York Post seriously.		Actually, I take that back: I can totally believe it.		#EssentialConsultants
@IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Just to recap the M.O., you:	1. make a lot of noise about a nothingburger story;	2. can’t find any evidence to support your claim; and then	3. claim the evidence has disappeared.		Genius!
@Tshirtbordello @TomStratton11 @johncardillo Donald pays people money to hide the truth not to uncover it. #StormyDaniels
@RepJasonSmith @realDonaldTrump You’re thankful for the “leadership” of the moron who caused the shutdown?		Next you’re going to tell us you think he’s a stable genius.
@RepDLamborn @POTUS Please do tell us about the inherent dignity of a man who sleeps with a porn star a few months after the birth of his 5th child to his 3rd wife and brags about assaulting women.
@dottybrug @RepAndyBarr @SenateDems Your empathy gene seems to be malfunctioning or missing.
@dgzipes @GOPChairwoman It’s a #TrumpShutdown. But, while I would love for you to remember that in November, I’m betting you won’t. People didn’t desert the GOP when they forced the last shutdown either.
@RepAndyBarr @SenateDems Republicans let CHIP expire in September and they keep promising to take care of Dreamers but never do and time is running out.		This whole mess could’ve been avoided had Republicans already “done the right thing”.
@JohnCornyn Go talk to Donald. You guys had a bipartisan proposal. He screwed it up; he can fix it. https://t.co/GM5katqxc6
@RepMattGaetz @BreitbartNews Why do you continue to put your party before your country in order to obfuscate and delay? You’re a shill for Donald Trump and an embarrassment to the good people of #FL01. 		Resign or be replaced.
@RepAndyHarrisMD Nobody likes a whiner who tries to blame other people as a means to cover up their own ineptitude.	A problem the people of #MD01 will fix this November. @AllisonforMD
@jpodhoretz Hmm... one was about protecting women’s rights and the other was about taking them away.		It’s almost as if Twitter thought one was more important than the other.		Judging by the attendance, it seems the American people thought so too.
@RepDavidRouzer Go talk to Donald. Democrats &amp; Republicans came to him with a bipartisan proposal that funds CHIP, protects DACA immigrants, funds the military &amp; border security. Trump could end the #TrumpShutDown in an instant.
@cathymcmorris What the American people are not buying is your attempt to frame it as the “SchumerShutdown” .		Everybody knows it’s the #TrumpShutdown.
@RepMattGaetz There has been a real attempt to undermine the nation’s law enforcement &amp; it comes from the dumbest of places. Why doesn’t Matt Gaetz want the American people to know the truth?
@SenateMajLdr Republicans control the Senate	Republicans control the House	Republicans control the Executive Branch.		Any failure to pass a bill is totally on Republicans.
@RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump If you believe in “America First” maybe you shouldn’t be on Fox every day trying to undermine the nation’s law enforcement officers.
@JohnCornyn He won’t read it. How about you *tell* him it includes the wall? He’ll sign it &amp; tweet his victory... he’ll be telling a lie but, hey, what’s new - no one will care and we’ll all move on. And you will have done the right thing for the country.
@TomCottonAR @trumps_feed Pro tip: “Of course” invariably means “I have no evidence to support this claim but just believe me when I tell you that...”
@foxandfriends TV network responsible for misleading viewers, blames former President for pointing out that their viewers have been mislead.
@jmchamb21 @krassenstein @Dainty_Dragon @realDonaldTrump I think you’ll find exactly zero people denied he made the remarks... until now.
@foxandfriends His pants are perpetually on fire as well.
@yunieldelgado @foxandfriends @nedryun Wow. This is wrong on so many levels. You need to go back and read the Constitution.
@RepJayapal Because they never stopped to draw a line in the sand.		How would they rationalize it?	“I’m OK with his sexually assaulting women and colluding with a hostile foreign power. I’m also OK with his racism... so long as he doesn’t use bad language.”
@realDonaldTrump I do believe you’re talking out of your #shithole again.
@TuckerCarlson But he’s not talking about the countries, is he? He’s talking about their people.		If he were talking about their countries, he ought to have done exactly as you imply in Option B: offer to help their people.
@RepMattGaetz Dianne Feinstein releasing the testimony of Glenn Simpson, really undermines my credibility and exposes me as a mendacious hack who has sold out his constituents.
@RepMattGaetz @seanhannity Is there a quota of “hours spent spewing BS on the air” that you need to hit every day?
@RepJimBanks Err... https://t.co/iKVUNeSuDy
@MarshaBlackburn So pass a law to protect them. This is not rocket science. You’re a legislator, Republicans committed to help them. Do your job and quit whining about what Obama did.
@glockthisway @GadflyQuebec @ConservativeGM @paulsperry_ Because in 1986 Congress provided authority under Title 18 USC §2331 for the FBI to investigate extraterritorial acts of terrorism where an American is killed or seriously injured.
@JPDcad123 @KGforTrump @seanhannity Of course not. He can’t help himself: even the tweet about the fake news poll was fake news.
@RepKristiNoem With loopholes for hedge fund managers, golf course owners, real estate moguls and private jet owners, the new tax code was clearly written with the über rich in mind. 	Your prevarication is brazenly transparent.
@RepMattGaetz Maybe a question about why you’ve abdicated your responsibility as an equal branch of government? Your constituents expect you to look out for their interests not the Executive Branch’s. @SRFLDEC @PhilEhr #FL01
@mstiman @Scotttaylorva Precisely. And this was - I believe - @wandac1974 ‘s point. That 1.8% is not going to save you in November.
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Err...	https://t.co/ZRUYKoY3pc
@LoveAgapeLove1 @Hava_Batia18 @CampaignPoli @washingtonpost @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama It’s possible @Hava_Batia18 ‘s god is Gozer the Gozerian.		In which case, I have to concede @realDonaldTrump is a much more effective Destructor than the #staypuftmarshmallowman.
@Hava_Batia18 @CampaignPoli @washingtonpost Since he served two full terms, we must conclude either a) prayers don’t work; or b) God did not agree with you.		I’ll let you pick.
@terrymurphy06 @FoxNews @mattgaetz Don’t blame the people of #FL01. Sure, they’re the ones who put him there but they’re also the ones who will replace him with someone who actually represents their interests. @PhilEhr
@RepMattGaetz @AmericaNewsroom @FoxNews Will you be “discussing” or just regurgitating the talking points that our dumpster fire of a president has given you?
@cathymcmorris Did you need to give away $269 billion to the wealthiest 5,500 families so the rest of the country could have a few bucks in their pockets?	How are you going to pay for it without cutting programs we’ve all paid into?
@scmcarp @ResistTrump17 @CNN Yes. But if you struggle with spelling, I can appreciate why you might not.
@RepThomasMassie 1. Represent the interests of your constituents.	2. Uphold your constitutional obligation as an equal branch of government.		You better get a move on because mine is:	1. Work night &amp; day to unseat every member of Congress who doesn’t.
@SenCapito @DM_opinion It’s clear the monstrosity of this law is proportional to the effort you’re having to expend to sell it.
@ChuckGrassley For people like me irritated because Fox News Channel is not a news channel, you can right now improve your IQ by 20 points by simply turning the television off.
@cathymcmorris Physician, heal thyself.
@RepKristiNoem A “quarter million” is a little bit more than the US economy needs to generate PER MONTH just to keep the unemployment rate steady; spending $1.5T to generate that many over 10yrs is a complete joke.
@Scotttaylorva @bright_kolleen Not everyone needs the same amount of help. If you were hoping we would all thank you for some crumbs, while you blow a giant hole in the deficit to give $1.4T to your wealthy donors &amp; special interests, you are gravely mistaken.
@RepKristiNoem Congrats to you, your wealthy donors and special interests who dearly wanted this $1.4T relief!
@ijindexjournal @RepJeffDuncan Contrary to the GOP spin, this bill is geared towards wealthy donors and special interests. To the extent there is any benefit for average American taxpayers, it is minuscule and temporary.
@realDonaldTrump Don’t worry, Trump. Your attempts to cripple the healthcare system that millions of people rely on and benefit from is not something we’re going to forget.
@cathymcmorris And wrongs a significantly larger number of rights.
@cathymcmorris MYTH: Republicans care about American working families.	FACT: The GOP threw some crumbs to the masses so they won’t notice the $1.4T giveaway for wealthy donors &amp; special interests, which have NOTHING to do with helping working families.
@SenBlumenthal Tell them 9 million former embryos are at risk and see if that gets their attention.
@my2gr8girls @BrookeH35150385 @starmlw @hartsigns @guypbenson Congressional Republicans want you to doubt the financial viability of government programs precisely so that when they take the money you paid into them and give it to the 1%, you will just shrug your shoulders.	Thanks for obliging, rubes.
@RepMattGaetz @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Does @realDonaldTrump have some #Kompromat on you and that’s why you spend every waking hour carrying water for him?	The people of #FL01 will not forget how quickly and how emphatically you chose your party over your country.
@RepMattGaetz Well, good job “staying on message” for a day to promote the #GOPTaxScam. I see you’re now back to trying to sell this canard. We’re not buying it.
RT @benwikler: Hi, I’d like to report a robbery https://t.co/qRh9sN2HyI
@DaphneLittle2 @MichaelDKarras @Brian_Riedl ...said the wealthiest 1% of Americans, adding, “fiscal responsibility is for losers.”
@MarshaBlackburn @FoxBusiness This bill costs $1.5T, throws peanuts to the people of #TN07 while giving massive kickbacks to wealthy donors. It’s clear you can’t (or won’t )stand up for your constituents’ interests...	...which is why @kanew will replace you.
@RepJimBanks “A good day for the future of the American Dream*”		*American Dream only available to richest 1% and large corporate donors. Other demographics need not apply.
@RepShimkus And this 1,079 page bill does that how exactly?
@cathymcmorris @TheDailyCaller “The Big Donor Relief Act”.		Fixed it for you. You’re welcome.
@PeteSessions It may have brought prosperity to corporations and the rich but not to hard working lower &amp; middle class Americans. Your #GOPTaxScam only exacerbates that iniquity. 	The people of #TX32 will not forget this.
@PRyan @dcexaminer When you say “we”, you’re evidently just referring to yourself and your fellow Republican scam artists. #GOPTaxScam
@RepAndyBarr And how about the 5,500 richest families who will get to keep $269 billion of their unearned money?
@RepMattGaetz @DailyCaller Sit down, you utter cockwomble.		Seriously, you’re embarrassing yourself and the people of #FL01 with your ridiculous rants.
@SenatorDurbin Stick to your position of not voting to fund the government unless this is included. Republicans can fund the government by themselves, they can force a shutdown by themselves or they can come to you for the votes.
@JohnCornyn Maybe this bill would be more popular if you fought for all Americans to get a #corkerkickback ?
@JohnCornyn Democrats are for tax reform; they’re against tax scams...	...as are your constituents.
@mark5A5 @taylen24 @AcademicAgent @SteveScalise I believe the kids today call that “whataboutism”. Nice try though.
@mark5A5 @taylen24 @AcademicAgent @SteveScalise My claim is based on basic economic theory. If you have an example of for-profit entities giving away their most expensive product en masse, that would be useful.
@mark5A5 @taylen24 @AcademicAgent @SteveScalise OK - so, no on the triage requirement, yes on the dystopia. Got it. 	More competition sounds great but, if you get hit by a bus, who’s supposed to check the Yelp reviews of the various 911 ambulance services while you’re lying unconscious in the street?
@mark5A5 @taylen24 @AcademicAgent @SteveScalise Lol. Your “swamp” wants to *add* $1.5T to the debt.
@mark5A5 @taylen24 @AcademicAgent @SteveScalise And, again, the ER is the only access point they have and it’s *the* most expensive part of the system. It’s actually cheaper for the entire system to *give* people insurance that includes preventive care so they don’t burden the rest of us by using the ER.
@mark5A5 @taylen24 @AcademicAgent @SteveScalise Of course, if you decide you want to keep that rule, we’re back to the situation where you force everyone else to pay higher premiums to cover the cost of the person who would not (or could not) buy their own insurance.
@mark5A5 @taylen24 @AcademicAgent @SteveScalise The dystopian scenario doesn’t exist because hospitals are today required to treat life threatening cases or women giving birth. You already implied we should get rid of that requirement (“it’s up to the hospital”).
@mark5A5 @taylen24 @AcademicAgent @SteveScalise OK, cool. So hospitals, to maximize profits, will obviously  just turn all those people away and - rightfully - focus on paying customers. 	And the poor can, presumably, just die on the street.
@mark5A5 @taylen24 @AcademicAgent @SteveScalise I’m confused: a moment ago you said basic triage will *always* be offered but now you’re saying it’s up to the hospital. Which is it?
@mark5A5 @taylen24 @AcademicAgent @SteveScalise No, that’s not how this works. We already established it’s a free market system. You can’t ask a corporation to start giving its most expensive product away for free.
@mark5A5 @taylen24 @AcademicAgent @SteveScalise OK, then. So, just for the avoidance of doubt, your position is that someone who shows up at an ER but is unable to pay should be turned away?
@mark5A5 @taylen24 @AcademicAgent @SteveScalise If your answer is “yes”, then we’re saying a “product” should be delivered regardless of the consumer’s ability to pay for it; if your answer is “no”, your saying rich people deserve to live longer and screw everyone else.
@mark5A5 @taylen24 @AcademicAgent @SteveScalise No, it’s not like any other product. If two children get the same disease and one belongs to a rich family and the other belongs to a poor family, should they be entitled to the same level of care?
@mark5A5 @taylen24 @AcademicAgent @SteveScalise This is on its face simply false and, again, shows a basic lack of understanding about how Obamacare works. Obamacare is a convoluted market-based compromise that exists specifically because conservatives won’t support a single payer system.
@mark5A5 @Magdalena0113 @SteveScalise ... 2) If not everyone buys insurance, you end up with risk pools that only have sick people in them, which then become increasingly unaffordable until they collapse.
@mark5A5 @Magdalena0113 @SteveScalise The problems are 1) if you don’t purchase insurance and can’t afford to pay for healthcare, that cost is transferred to the rest of us in higher premiums (ironically, your failure to take personal responsibility is “socialized”)...
@mark5A5 @SteveScalise S.1770 “Health Equity and Access Reform Today” 103rd Congress. Chafee (R-RI) + 20 co-sponsors. Included universal access, no discrimination for pre-existing conditions and, yes, an individual mandate. https://t.co/iypRw9T82e
@mark5A5 @SteveScalise And you’re correct. Democrats, took a Republican plan and bent over backwards to accommodate Republican ideas but got exactly zero GOP support for it.	So, next time, they will absolutely push for single payer. They have no incentive to do otherwise.
@mark5A5 @SteveScalise The reason why the GOP’s ACA repeal failed so miserably is because the ACA *is* a right-wing plan and there are no better ideas to the right of it... but there are plenty of ideas to the left.
@LouDobbs @RepMattGaetz @POTUS “Corrupt partisan hack, @RepMattGaetz “		There I fixed it for you. You’re welcome.
@mark5A5 @SteveScalise As for costs, ~20% of private insurance premiums go towards admin costs (aka figuring out ways to deny your claim). The admin costs for Medicare &amp; Medicaid is 3%.	But, by all means, stick some blue paint on your face and throw your money away.
@mark5A5 @SteveScalise Then you’ll be happy to hear there is no “socialist health care” involved in the ACA. The mandate is to buy private insurance. Maybe you missed that point.
@mark5A5 @SteveScalise You think you’re going to escape the shackles of the “medical industrial complex” by not buying insurance?		Not planning to interact with the healthcare system at all?		Good luck with that.
@darnskippy @SteveScalise @Surfernicole1 You’re benefiting from government-run healthcare (which Republicans plan to cut) and blaming Obama for a mandate to buy private insurance that Republicans forced him to include? I think your irony gene is missing.
@darnskippy @SteveScalise @Surfernicole1 You do realize you could’ve had access to Medicare as part of the Affordable Care Act? But the Republicans said “no” to that idea.
@SteveScalise It’s clear you have no clue about the economics of our healthcare system. Disgraceful.
@RepLynnJenkins Do the rich deserve to pay less?	Does the middle class deserve to pay more?	Do they deserve to lose their health insurance?	Do they deserve to be scammed? #GOPTaxScam
@JohnCornyn He does. And your failure to recognize that will be your undoing.
@cathymcmorris And right on cue... so where is this “stagnant economy” of which you speak? https://t.co/9mmroSDuJS
@ToddRokita Just a reminder: this tax scam polls @ 29%; the ACA polls @ 57%.		You should definitely push the former and destroy the latter. That won’t backfire on you at all. Now hold my beer: I have to go donate to @Shipley4Indiana
@cathymcmorris I keep on hearing from the Giant Toddler how the markets are roaring, unemployment is dropping and it’s rainbows &amp; ponies all round.		But you seem to be painting a much more dire picture. Are you lying or are you calling the President a liar? 🤔
@RepMattGaetz Do you keep deleting your tweet because of the typos or because you don’t like the responses? https://t.co/WnXop37Zxz
@RepMattGaetz Gaetz, who has less integrity than one of Mueller’s bowel movements, is an embarrassment to the people of #FL01 and his attempt to impugn Mueller’s character is utterly disgraceful. 2/2
@RepMattGaetz You will not find a more honorable public servant than Robert Mueller. How respected is he? As a reminder, as FBI Director he had a 10yr term limit but the Senate voted 100-0 to extend it by 2yrs. 1/2 https://t.co/kK0f7ZkPcY
@mattgaetz @RepBrianMast You might not want to be so quick to turn that down... given that you’re getting fired from your current job next year. @PhilEhr
@MsCharlieJohnso @RepShimkus Time to get behind @CarlSpoerer2018
RT @MackenzieAstin: Hey, @AjitPaiFCC, today my mom would have turned 71. But she didn't. Because she died in March of 2016. Can you please…
@spiked200 @RepErikPaulsen Republicans use statistics like a drunk uses a lamp post: for support rather than enlightenment.
@SenCapito @wvmanufacturers Please keep on lying: it’s good material for the ads we’re going to run against you.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ Trying to deflect your support for the #GOPTaxScam by attacking our nation’s law enforcement doesn’t sound like a winning strategy. 		The people of #AZ05 are running out of reasons to keep supporting you.
@SaraCarterDC @FoxNews BREAKING: The Trump Administration is now using the FoxNews App to fire employees.
@cathymcmorris @POTUS Just FYI, from now on every time you make a demonstrably false statement like this, I’m just going to chip in to @lisa4congress. Think of it as your personal #GOPSwearBox https://t.co/RUo0xsiMmH
@Sooriclover @CHRIS_P_LANGAN @MajSchroeder @SenSchumer Let’s also not forget that the @SenateMajLdr was so committed to respecting the will of the people that he held up a Supreme Court nomination for 10 months.
@RepMarkMeadows Were you hoping this ridiculous comment would distract the people of #NC11 so they wouldn’t notice you’re screwing them with your support for the #GOPTaxScam?		Good luck with that.

@senrobportman You do understand that just repeating this ad nauseam doesn’t make it true, right?
@USRepKCastor What’s new? Republicans repeatedly implement irresponsible policies based on magical math and, when it all falls apart, the Democrats are called in to clean up the mess.		Fiscal responsibility is a Democratic trait not a Republican one.
@RepThomasMassie Well, it seems the current goal is for us to become a Russian client state. Were you hoping for something more than that?
@RepBillShuster @POTUS @realDonaldTrump That must mean you’re against the #GOPTaxScam which is great to hear! ‘Cos if that monstrosity goes through, it’ll blow a giant hole in the deficit and leave exactly zero dollars available for an infrastructure bill.
@RepThomasMassie Your comment exposes your ignorance about what State does. We’re losing career professionals - people who speak multiple languages &amp; are experts on their field. They are very hard to replace. Much harder than, say, replacing the congressman for #KY04
@RepAndyBiggsAZ @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews Mueller is filing charges to which people are pleading guilty. His integrity, unlike yours, is beyond reproach.	But please keep slandering him: I’m sure the constituents of #AZ05 love politicians who put party before country.
@GuidoFawkes That’s a persuasive sales pitch. Perhaps you should put it on the side of a bus.
@realDonaldTrump “My orange turnip head has decided to royally screw up any chance at a Middle East peace solution.” There. Fixed it for you.
@W7VOA @WhiteHouse @DeutscheBank @realDonaldTrump i.e. There is no way Trump would know if the bank had received and/or responded to a subpoena for his bank records.
@W7VOA @WhiteHouse @DeutscheBank @realDonaldTrump It would be normal policy at a bank that employees are prohibited from informing clients that they are part of a government (or internal) investigation.
@StellaStanding @marcorubio @WSJ And as predicted, your boy’s amendment failed and he voted yes anyway.
@StellaStanding @marcorubio @WSJ I think that was your premise but there are myriad ways in which this bill is *designed* to reward big Republican donors rather than the lower/middle class. It is a heist, plain &amp; simple.
@SenateGOP @SenateMajLdr Alan Keck will be pleased to hear that the #GOPTaxscam *adds* to the complexity of the tax code.
@SenateMajLdr 925,000 jobs for $1.5 Trillion? That’s more than $1.5million to create one job. 	You guys are the best deal makers.
@StellaStanding @marcorubio @WSJ if the tax cuts were also extended. Which they did.
@StellaStanding @marcorubio @WSJ Obama’s situation was different because a) we were coming out of an economic collapse and the economy needed government stimulus (no such need today: we’re at full employment); b) Dems would’ve preferred spending over tax cuts but Reps would only agree to extend benefits 1/
@StellaStanding @marcorubio @WSJ If “pols” were doing a bunch of popular things that jacked up the deficit, I would agree with you. My point is that the plan in its totality is hugely *unpopular* *and* jacks up the deficit.
@StellaStanding @marcorubio @WSJ 3 points. 1. The deficit is one of *many* problems with this bill; 2. It is not popular; quite the opposite; 3. Obama’s situation was completely different and not a relevant analogy.
@StellaStanding @marcorubio @WSJ It blows a 1.5 trillion hole in the deficit. If you’re banking on the individual cuts being extended, that problem will be significantly worse. 		It’s also a fig leaf because Rubio &amp; Lee will vote “yes” even without their amendment.
@SenCapito Feel free to shout that from the mountain top. I’m not sure how many of the nation’s 1% follow you on Twitter but the rest of us are busy picking out primary candidates. #runforsomething
@StellaStanding @marcorubio @WSJ His amendment is a fig leaf. It doesn’t fix this. https://t.co/15c2xq6Th6
@marcorubio @WSJ WSJ:“Rubio’s robbing the rich to give to the poor.”	Rubio:”Giving to the poor is a good thing.”	Actual plan: rob the poor to give to the rich.		#TFW when you have to defend your lie to the very people you’re lying for.
@SenPatRoberts Wow! We *only* have to pay $1.5 trillion, mortgage our children’s future, help 13 million people lose their healthcare, take $5bn from the poorest and give it to the richest... and in return, Kansas gets 9,000 jobs! You. Are. Awesome.
@SenatorTimScott The invisible 1%? 	#TaxScamBill
@senorrinhatch @SenatorTimScott Are you quoting other people’s lies now because you’re getting tired of having to do all the lying by yourself?		Literally every serious tax policy analysis shop says you’re lying.	#TaxScamBill
@SenRonJohnson @AjitPaiFCC @620wtmj These are the problems net neutrality solves. What problem do you think you’re solving by getting rid of it? https://t.co/SHPgb3LVri
@CrazyHanSolo @ColinIsAce @SenCapito There are many reasons why some working class WV may have voted for Trump but “so I can be royally screwed by a tax scam” was probably not one of them.
@SteveLAdams @realCodyPorter @toddjmerr @tired_puppy @ayai9101 @demond_t @shamroxPat @IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Added to which, “tax reform” isn’t law so, again, 45 has done *nothing*. 		You can’t even argue consumer confidence - the majority of voters (rightly) think the bill stinks.
@JohnCornyn Why does any market regulation exist except to enforce a principle that the market has no incentive to implement on its own.		The bigger question is: what problem do you think you’re solving by getting rid of it?
@SteveDaines This tweet is 100% accurate... if you are a supporter of net neutrality. 		If that wasn’t your intention, then it’s clear you don’t understand how net neutrality works and you’re betraying the interests of your constituents.
@KrisKobach1787 When you say “meet”, do you mean “talk to via the handset that’s on the wall while we look at each other through the bulletproof glass”?
@SenatorEnzi Also. 1800 jobs? Seriously?	Given WY’s share of the civilian labor force and the $1.5Tn price tag for this bill, that works out to $1.5m per job created.		What a stellar achievement.
@SenatorEnzi “On average”?!! https://t.co/QwuaizDB8p
@JohnCornyn High Risk Pools 	Do. Not. Work.	Cutting the mandate *will* result in higher premiums for everyone and *will* result in millions of people losing coverage. Your ignorance and/or stupidity *will* hurt the people of #Texas
@senorrinhatch Either you don’t know that middle class families will be worse off under this Bill, or you do know but you don’t care. 		Regardless, you are utterly failing the people of #Utah.
@SenatorEnzi By “people’s pockets” he means millionaires’ pockets. And by “help create jobs” he means the thoroughly debunked “trickle down” theory.		All you need to do to take part in this pipe dream is pay some more taxes and give up your health coverage.
@SenatorEnzi Kick them off? No. Create high risk pools that cause premiums to spiral out of control which in turn kicks people off? Yes. Whether your ignorance is willful or not, the people of #Wyoming deserve better.
@JimInhofe do you want to have another crack at this question? Because it sounds like you’re recklessly gambling with the lives and livelihoods of the people of #Oklahoma. https://t.co/z4pByHLzaA
@realDonaldTrump Yes, may God be with them. Because this Administration certainly isn’t.
@ANTHONYBLOGAN Is there some new definition of the phrase “stay quiet” that doesn’t  involve... you know... staying quiet? 🤔
@Brent77A @ElvaF2009 @dandrezner And I’m saying these are professionals with years of expertise in their field who have served multiple administrations; they cannot easily be replaced.		https://t.co/TVDootoXoS
@Brent77A @ElvaF2009 @dandrezner I think you misunderstand how State is staffed. Some are political appointees but the vast majority are career civil servants. And they’re all gone.
@ARmastrangelo Almost without exception, every criticism of the ACA includes evidence that the critic doesn't actually understand how the ACA works.
@SenatorEnzi Here's a radical idea: you could work with Democrats to make the ACA better.
@LynnRN54 @thislifetoday @teyotyree @Lrihendry @yyc5777 @factcheckdotorg I'm afraid, my dear, until you do the research, an argument from authority won't cut any ice. Go and read. I'm happy to wait.
@LynnRN54 @thislifetoday @teyotyree @Lrihendry @yyc5777 @factcheckdotorg I know: learning is hard. But I promise, if you invest a little time researching this issue yourself, it'll pay off in spades.
@thislifetoday @teyotyree @Lrihendry @yyc5777 @factcheckdotorg But it's the only type that Voter ID laws address.
@gbillingsleyjr @thislifetoday @teyotyree @Lrihendry @yyc5777 @factcheckdotorg Unfortunately, choosing to ignore the data doesn't make it magically disappear.
@gbillingsleyjr @thislifetoday @teyotyree @Lrihendry @yyc5777 @factcheckdotorg Again, read the research. https://t.co/TqC7JxRZbH
@thislifetoday @teyotyree @Lrihendry @yyc5777 @factcheckdotorg I'm worried that you won't bother reading the existing research.
@thislifetoday @teyotyree @Lrihendry @yyc5777 @factcheckdotorg Money quote: "It is more likely that an individual will be struck by lightning than that he will impersonate another voter at the polls."
@thislifetoday @teyotyree @Lrihendry @yyc5777 @factcheckdotorg We actually do know how big the issue is. I suggest you start here: https://t.co/OAWxlKXY6c
@thislifetoday @teyotyree @Lrihendry @yyc5777 @factcheckdotorg Voter ID laws solve a minuscule voter fraud problem; but also prevent vast numbers of eligible citizens from voting. That's the connection.
@thislifetoday @teyotyree @Lrihendry @yyc5777 @factcheckdotorg We have laws already. The burden of proof lies with you to demonstrate those laws are inadequate.
@thislifetoday @teyotyree @Lrihendry @yyc5777 @factcheckdotorg For someone who a moment ago was demanding proof that illegal voting isn't a thing, you suddenly seem quite sure of yourself.
@thislifetoday @teyotyree @Lrihendry @yyc5777 @factcheckdotorg And I think we can all agree that suppressing millions of eligible votes in order to prevent a handful of illegal votes is fucking insane.
@TheBigDippur @realDonaldTrump Good of you to admit that it was just about pissing off liberals and not, you know, literally saving the planet.
@victoriathomsom @SenatorTester I hope you were equally vocal about 8 years of Republican obstruction under Obama.
Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump for having the lowest ever approval ratings on Inauguration Day of any President - public is smart! https://t.co/hy1PXbXEX4
