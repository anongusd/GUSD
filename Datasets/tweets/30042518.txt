@WCCOEL @wccoradio @HennepinSheriff @davehutch2018 Congratulations!  Being self-assigned, I won’t have to be on the public side of the yellow tape to pester you for answers.  But, the others...
@paulmagers Seems like Security is the mission.
@LindaIHiggins @irenekfernando @Hennepin You can call it, self-assigned.
@janashortal I thought the wake seemed warmer than usual.  Now, the reason...
@JohnCroman Chandelier.
@JeffPassoltFOX9 Fried.
@mlahammer @TimPawlenty Wonderful.
@paulmagers I use the app on my personal distraction device, which usually corresponds to conditions.  The quote is very accurate.
@BoydHuppert Good story!
@paulmagers I get the same feeling at the library.  Also, how much I don’t know.
@patricktcondon @StarTribune Have a fulfilling experience.
@paulmagers It’s not the former member of the Grass Roots who had a recurring part in “The Office.”
@mlahammer I voted today.  Oct.4 with an in person absentee ballot in Hudson, Wi.  There were two voting booth.  Three of us voted in the time I was there.
@paulmagers Glory days.
Working on processing some images in Lightroom of an Elvis Tribute Artist.  This one is, “Taking Care of Business-In a Flash.”  Has a nice ring to it. https://t.co/vs0Aa4YOAR
@soledadobrien Wouldn’t have been printed in the yearbook I worked on.
@DylanWohlenhaus Excellent.  Good message and the song is good.  Positive message.
@IAmMaggieRose @LandOLakesKtchn @NBCTheVoice Excellent.
@paulmagers This surpasses the famous three legged dog stories. And, the albino squirrel.
@griswoldkmtv Sometimes, from my experience, the people on television seem more real than the people in their own lives who they would never criticize. And, since you are a guest in their home or distraction device, there is a compulsion to be critical.
@paulmagers But, not always free.
@paulmagers Our man in Amsterdam-“Pulp Fiction.
@WCCORosen Healing.
@paulmagers That was a pretty big deal.  I was covering a St. Paul police retirement event in the basement of the Lexington Restaurant.  It was sunny in St. Paul.  The vo I fed back of the retirement was cut because the show was full.
@timnelson_mpr I’m curious about endorsement deals that our masked friend will be able to negotiate on the cat food brand.  Perhaps, the often mentioned law firm will offer pro bono help.  Great reporting, Tim!  Live images were excellent. A top shelf MPR membership should be offered.
@BillLunnKSTP Had he heard of George Jones.
@paulmagers Paint me a word picture.  And, for our sight impaired audience, describe how it sounded, from a freight train to a backyard water feature as your audio bookends.  We will be right back...
@paulmagers Every day can be Spam day with the right skillet.
Double cheesebow in Western Wisconsin. https://t.co/vtAc34gcUt
@paulmagers Cards have larger  hearts, diamonds, spades and clubs.  Like large print books.  Nothing wrong with wanting to see.  That shows we are alive.
