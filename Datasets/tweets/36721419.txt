@PsychTerpJune But if your a cavegiver....or family member...your life doesn't matter!!!  How many stories would you like to hear about this real truth!
@PsychTerpJune @KevinHinesStory None of us matter to the Dod or the VA?  They have hid all they have known for decades!
@PsychTerpJune This will only happen if the Military culture changes. Until you've seen how soldiers &amp; their families are treated on post-U don't know.

@POTUS Does anyone in Gov. or Dod actually Care? https://t.co/qi465hOQM1
@JohnCornyn Maybe they would consider this? As far as I can tell, No one in Gov or Dod Cares :(https://t.co/qi465hOQM1

Wondering what the state of our country will look like in five years?  I wish I could say I believe in our government officials.
Still trying to get the hang of this...spend much more time on facebook!!!  look me up there :)
Enjoying an overcast day, following a great 4th of July!  Hoping the rain will hold out and we can go fishing and canoing later :)
