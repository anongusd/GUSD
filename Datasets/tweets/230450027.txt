As Inslee would be the first to tell you, of course, he‚Äôs been talking about climate (and insisting it‚Äôs a winning political issue) for years and years and years and
Jay Inslee, the Washington governor, is now in the race for president.		He‚Äôs no front-runner, but his climate-first candidacy will be a telling test of how open Democrats are to that kind of message just as the Green New Deal debate settles in.

@micahcohen @prioritiesUSA yeah a Reynolds vs. Trump map would be different, too
@micahcohen ...in that sense it probably makes sense for them to focus on ~4 states that are *def* tossups while keeping medium presences in ~10 more for as long as possible, until hard decisions are necessary. Which is, of course, the plan, insofar as there is one.
@micahcohen actually, I'll give a less annoying answer.		Yes! And I think the huge range of potential D nominees actually makes it pretty hard for Ds to plan for the general, in a way that's not really broadly appreciated (yet)...
@micahcohen @prioritiesUSA definitely, maybe.
@micahcohen @prioritiesUSA I don't think anyone is realistically going to make too many enormous strategic decisions assuming this is the whole story, already.		But! It didn't go unnoticed that Priorities has put Ohio and Iowa in the same "maybe we'll go here...maybe" category as Texas.
To spell it out, for a sec: @kkondik has AZ and NH starting as basic toss-ups, while @guycecil and the priorities team have them as second-tier, while focusing on FL and MI @ first, instead.		(Tho: obv Kyle and Priorities are coming from very different places, here!)
Interesting to compare this map to the initial target list outlined by Dem super PAC @prioritiesUSA last week. The overlap in the top tier tossup category: WI/PA. But they disagree about how to handle AZ/NH/FL/MI.		An agreement, though: the map is extremely small entering '20. https://t.co/xrc9FqRlWY

When Sanders announced his campaign last week, he said he was looking for 1 million people to back him. His team just said he's hit that mark.		But the number that other campaigns will notice: "The sign ons include...324,186 new people who were not part of Sanders‚Äô 2016 campaign"
Quick clarification on Warren's announcement: she's not doing any *high-dollar* events with big donors ‚Äî¬†the kinds of receptions that traditionally take up a lot of candidates' time. She's not necessarily ruling out big events with people who chip in small amounts.
For example, many were surprised when Warren went to LA last week and didn't do any fundraising there. The expectation is that candidates spend a ton of time on this. Obviously it's very risky ‚Äî¬†campaigns are expensive. But Warren's also sitting on a lot of $ already.
Warren's move is noteworthy for the obvious reasons, and it puts a ton of pressure on her digital operation. But it's also interesting because campaigns often consider the candidate's time to be the most important resource they have. Choosing to allocate 0 of it to $ is telling.
Elizabeth Warren is announcing this AM that she'll hold zero in-person fundraisers, or parties, or whatever, with donors to her campaign, and no call time with them either.

This is interesting. Leahy endorsed Clinton in 2016, and Sanders only had one Senate backer: Jeff Merkley, who's now considering running himself. https://t.co/J7HpI8tRiz
@jchaltiwanger yes.
@JamesPindell of course. I'm old enough to remember when I wrote the 2015 version of "some people want Hillary to abandon NH, but she won't."
... (C) Some of the apparent complaints are that Harris didn't do enough to help NH Ds in '18. OK, that's a fair argument. But that angered local Dems so much that...her state director is the '18 NH gov candidate's campaign manager...?
The "why hasn't Kamala Harris spent more time in New Hampshire?!" stuff had been percolating for a while, especially among her opponents, but (A) it's hilariously early for this, (B) her path to the nomination was never going to run thru NH. And ...
hard to write a better ending to this particular chapter https://t.co/zBsHSeM6p4
Sanders' core team has been working thru what his path to the nomination might look like for well over a year now, drawing from both informal talks and official internal presentations. The short version &gt; https://t.co/SpL6TyF5D9
Over and over, Sanders has heard the argument‚Äîsometimes from allies‚Äîthat because Dems now embrace Medicare for All, $15 minimum wage + other central planks of his '16 pitch, he doesn't need to run again. His longtime private response is now public: he sees that as reason to run.
"Together, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution," Sanders wrote to supporters this morning. "Now, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for."
...But, he added, "If it turns out that I am the best candidate to beat Donald Trump, then I will probably run.‚Äù https://t.co/2WZ9o243k8		Two months later, here we are.
Sanders himself wasn't always sure he was going to run, but 2020 always loomed. Late last year, I asked him about his calculus.		"If there‚Äôs somebody else who appears who can, for whatever reason, do a better job than me, I‚Äôll work my ass off to elect him or her," he said...
No one doubts Sanders' challenge now will be dramatically different than last time, but he's been looking at 2020 since the moment he stepped aside in 2016. Watching his work in the Senate+his campaigning, many of those closest to him have always suspected this was coming.

@ShaneGoldmacher totally. And as we've seen, there's always a strategy to rolling these out. No need to do it all on Day One if you don't want to. Plus, Newsom has an obvious motivation for playing kingmaker for a bit ahead of CA's primary, if he wants.

@ShaneGoldmacher I'm just saying their situations aren't 100% comparable. Clearly Booker is out front on this. He's also the 1 with a state to himself, in terms of possible contenders. Not saying Cuomo or Schumer is going to endorse Bloomberg, or Newsom/Feinstein would back Swalwell, obviously.

Btw, getting some shades of Biden's 2015 announcement that he wasn't running. When the advisory went out that it would be in the WH Rose Garden, the immediate thought was: you can't announce your candidacy from there. Garcetti's gonna talk inside LA City Hall. Same deal.
For what it's worth, Team Garcetti was watching Harris' launch closely. He'd already been ramping down, and I'm not saying he decided because of Kamala. But there's no question the developments of this last week will have a lasting impact on the shape of the primary.
In addition to the money question, Harris will likely be especially cheered by Garcetti's exit because of the continued clearing of space in California, which now has a massively important primary...
@mollyhc tell that to bloomberg/booker/bernie/hickenlooper/castro/landrieu!

Harris' point today: "We must answer a fundamental question. Who are we? Who are we as Americans? So let's answer that Q...America, we are better than this."

Both Sanders and Biden have said they'll run if they think they're best positioned to beat Trump. Often, polls like these are presented to them by their allies/friends/supporters as evidence that they are.
Anyway...generally, these kinds of theoretical matchup polls are pretty meaningless, especially this far out. Duh!		However, there are two people who do pay attention to them, whose reads of them are pretty important right now: Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders.

@BenjySarlin of course. but i suspect to a lot of ‚Äî not all! ‚Äî voters, when they hear a politician say "i'm progressive" it means a version of "i'm liberal." so this is in large part, i think, about the labels carrying slightly different connotations for different audiences.
@BenjySarlin Rs have convinced Ds (at least the elected and elected-adjacent ones) that they've weaponized the latter; Ds think the former is still safe territory
And remember, Sanders has said he'll run if he's persuaded he's the best-positioned to beat Trump. He clearly believes he is, and his allies see their job as showing him/the rest of the party/world that there's (still) a movement out there waiting for him.
One point about these two Bernie draft groups: they're being run by some of his most loyal political allies/supporters, who have a direct line to him. So they look to be as much about convincing him as laying a public groundwork.

In general, the political media tends to overestimate the degree to which politicians are really entirely convinced they're going to run for president. They probably are! But sometimes it takes them a while to get there themselves.
‚Ä¶but the reality here is also that Biden/Bernie/Steyer are all known by their friends/associates etc to taaaake theeeeeir tiiiime with big decisions. It‚Äôs true they don‚Äôt have to hurry. But they were also never going to.
‚Ä¶the ‚Äúraise $ quickly‚Äù thing is also slightly off bc one of the lessons of the small-dollar digital $ age is that enormous amounts can be raised in spurts, around events. Candidates' drawn-out exploratory phases aren‚Äôt as much about $ as they were in previous cycles‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶for one, obviously Bloomberg and Steyer don‚Äôt need to worry about raising $ at all. People around Biden, meanwhile, don‚Äôt think he needs to raise as much as others do, because of his other structural advantages (name ID, etc.)‚Ä¶
There's a line of commentary going around that says Biden, Bloomberg, Bernie, Beto, Steyer, etc. can/will wait on announcing for 2020 bc they won't have issues raising $ quickly. That's true, but not exactly the point for them...
Since there's no way this week ends without more 2020 movement, some context: by the end of Jan 2007, 5 Dems and 6 Republicans were already running in (or, ahem, "exploring") the 2008 race.
Something you don‚Äôt see every day: on Warren‚Äôs campaign website, under the email sign-up (‚ÄúI‚Äôm all in‚Äù), there‚Äôs another option: ‚ÄúActually, I‚Äôm not in, and here‚Äôs why.‚Äù Links to, basically, a feedback page. https://t.co/QD94Twl8pK
@ShaneGoldmacher yes, assuming she's filing it electronically.
Of course, we can't see Warren's paperwork filing her 2020 exploratory committee today, because, well, the Federal Election Commission is shut down.
Expect to see a ton more movement from other 2020 Dems in the coming days/weeks, now. A lot were waiting for someone else to make some kind of move before they stepped in. Now the pressure is on to get in early, and to get in interestingly.
Here's Warren's announcement video. "If we organize together, if we fight together, if we persist together, we can win. We can, and we will." https://t.co/AMGORnWbUe

FWIW, in my own informal list of '20 contenders, I already have 14 leaning pretty heavily towards running, and another 12 as slightly less likely than that. 		So there are still questions about how big each debate stage would be. Is 13 each night still too many?
Dems' new debate plan is an exercise in trying to prove good faith + confident competence post-'16. The DNC‚Äôs implied bet: that its attempt to prove its finger is far from the scale will keep the focus on the candidates. The dozens + dozens of candidates. https://t.co/0baw9SLY1l
@jbarro would you also eliminate the "forums"?
If you're doing the whole "omg I can't believe it's already 2020!!!" thing, btw, it's worth considering that the first Democratic debate in the 2008 cycle was in **April** 2007.
The DNC is preparing for a 2020 free-for-all. Or, at least, preparing to be in position to try and manage it.		And it's clearly trying to avoid the mistakes of 2016 &gt; https://t.co/li1RlLLOcO
New: there will be 12 Dem primary debates, starting in June 2019, and running until April 2020, the DNC just announced.		And as long as there's a huge field, each debate will be divided over 2 consecutive nights, with each stage selected randomly.		More shortly...

The point is *not* that Biden is going to win! It may shock you to hear that I remember 2016, and 2008, and and and! Just that "don't write too much about the person who's leading early in the polls" is a weird takeaway.

Just to underscore this, because I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fully understood: I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all if, aside from Trump, DeVos was the single Republican named most often by Democratic candidates (stumping, in ads, in fundraising asks...). Anecdotally, that‚Äôs certainly the case.

It's just ahistorical to say that to disagree with "when they go low, we go high" is to subscribe to "the Avenatti way," like I've seen so often today. Negative, or tough, campaigning is not, like, a new or foreign idea to Democrats in 2018. Eric Holder knows that.

Jon Tester, Montana Democrat running for re-election, joins Donnelly voting no.
this is the former John McCain chief of staff and Republican AG of Arizona ‚Äî¬†who's said he may run for McCain's seat as a Dem in '20 ‚Äî¬†supporting the Democrat to replace Jeff Flake &gt; https://t.co/tnMEPRDbTa
Important context of Donnelly's vote: he's one of three Democrats who voted for Gorsuch. His re-election in November looks tighter than Manchin's, but safer than Heitkamp's.
Donnelly's political tightrope: "While I would gladly welcome the opportunity to work with Pres Trump on a new nominee for this critically important position, if Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination comes before the full Senate for a vote under these circumstances, I will oppose it"
Donnelly (Dem, up for reelection in Indiana) is a no on Kavanaugh.

"If you think elections don't matter, I hope the last two years have corrected that impression," says Obama. This feels like one of the lines we'll be hearing a lot from him.
the question is whether Democrats decide they *need* someone to try and replicate this. Or to try and come close. https://t.co/uNy1WP7pL1
"You cannot sit back and wait for a savior, you can‚Äôt opt out because you don't feel that inspired by this or that particular candidate," Obama says. "This is not a rock concert, this is not Coachella. We don't need a messiah."
@MattZeitlin somewhere, Antonio Weiss has a headache
"We're sure as heck supposed to stand up clearly and unequivocally to Nazi sympathizers," says Obama. "How hard can that be? Saying that Nazis are bad?"
"It should not be Democratic or Republican ‚Äî¬†it should not be a partisan issue ‚Äî¬†to say we should not use the Attorney General or the Justice Department as a cudgel to punish our political opponents," Obama says.
RT @aseitzwald: Obama calls Medicare for All a "good new idea."
Sure seemed like Obama was specifically shouting out Elizabeth Warren's anti-corruption legislation there, pointing to proposed bans on lobbyist contributions and foreign lobbying.
Obama's 2018 pitch, distilled: "We have the chance to restore some semblance of sanity to our politics."
"The claim that everything will be OK because there are people inside the White House who secretly are not following the president's orders? That is not a check ‚Äî¬†I'm being serious here ‚Äî that is not how our democracy is supposed to work." - Obama re NYT Op-Ed
"What happened to the Republican Party?," asks Obama. Their former organizing principle in foreign policy was anti-Communism, he says, "now they're cozying up to the former head of the KGB."
"Over the past few decades the politics of division and resentment and paranoia has unfortunately found a home in the Republican Party," Obama says.
"Appealing to tribe, appealing to fire, pitting one group against another, telling people that order and security will be restored if it weren‚Äôt for those who don‚Äôt look like us or don‚Äôt sound like us, or don‚Äôt pray like we do, that‚Äôs an old playbook. As old as time." - Obama
"When you hear how great the economy's doing right now, let's just remember, when this recovery started. I mean, I'm glad it's continued, but when you hear about this economic miracle that's been going on..." - Obama		(This might be the riff that annoys Rs most, from this speech)
@rickklein it is.
"It did not start with Donald Trump. He is a symptom, not the cause," says @BarackObama. "He's just capitalizing on resentments that politicians have been fanning for years."		(For those keeping track, that's the first time Obama's said "Trump" in public since leaving office.)
"Just a glance at recent headlines should tell you that this moment really is different, the stakes really are higher, the consequences of any of us sitting on the sidelines are more dire." - @BarackObama, returning to the political fray with a speech in Illinois happening now.

Barack Obama is hitting the campaign trail. Next week, he‚Äôll swing thru Cleveland for Ohio gubernatorial candidate @RichCordray and @SenSherrodBrown, Cordray‚Äôs campaign just announced
It‚Äôd be pretty hard to look at the last ~15 hours‚Äîstarting with the disrupted Kavanaugh hearings, to Rahm‚Äôs surprise decision not to run for re-election, ending with Pressley‚Äôs win over Capuano‚Äîand conclude that today‚Äôs Democratic Party is still anything like it was in Nov 2016.
And/but if you're looking for a '20 angle...Patrick's unlikely to feel much heat after Capuano's loss. Much of his political team lined up on the other side. The new pro-Patrick PAC treasurer, former party chair @JohnEWalsh14, became a *very* prominent Pressley backer/surrogate.
Tricky local Boston politics led to some interesting pre-2020 dynamics in this race, among some of Ds‚Äô biggest names...		Deval Patrick was w Capuano. So was Joe Kennedy III.		Elizabeth Warren + Seth Moulton stayed neutral.		Biggest local name behind Pressley was AG Maura Healey.
RT @Redistrict: The share of House Rs who are white men is 86% and rising. 		The share of House Dems who are white men is 41% and falling.‚Ä¶
One thing Pressley is *not*, in any way: a newcomer. National Dems have been waiting for/expecting her emergence one way or another ever since her 2015 acceptance speech in DC for @emilyslist's rising star award.		(The headliner that night was @HillaryClinton.)
Obviously all these races have enormously complicated local dynamics in play. BUT there's *clearly* a bigger national moment here. Neither Capuano (MA) nor Gwen Graham (FL, who was the front-runner, not an incumbent) were at all caught off guard like NY's Crowley.
Pressley's district is the only majority minority one in all of Massachusetts. The electorate has tended to be primarily white. She calls it the country‚Äôs most progressive and most unequal. https://t.co/bd255uHw37 https://t.co/kD7tiGC9L2
A huge part of Team Pressley's pitch all along:		"Voting right is a good place to start, but it‚Äôs not enough. ... In the room where the decisions are being made, is the congressperson from this district pushing the party to the left?" https://t.co/bd255uHw37
There it is. It may not get the Gillum or Ocasio-Cortez national treatment, but Pressley's primary win is a huge development. https://t.co/6YssN1y2K0

Warren is also proposing a permanent ban on lobbying for ex-members of Congress/presidents/heads of agencies.		She's calling it "the most ambitious anti-corruption legislation proposed in Congress since Watergate."

Anyway, here‚Äôs a quick snapshot of Kobach‚Äôs last few months. https://t.co/EqqAzuJaEd https://t.co/PtxODqYnmI
Kobach sees his campaign, along with Arpaio‚Äôs in AZ and Barletta‚Äôs in PA, as a sign that his/Trump‚Äôs immigration views are surging. But Kobach is the front-runner here anyway, so little downside for Trump in endorsing if he wants some credit if/when Kobach wins tomorrow.
Kobach is, in many ways, the beating heart of distilled proto-Trumpian policy. He‚Äôs been at the center of some of the country‚Äôs biggest illegal immigration fights for years, and was the source of Trump‚Äôs claim that he actually won the popular vote in ‚Äò16 https://t.co/EqqAzuJaEd
When I asked Kobach last week if this tweet was coming, he smiled. My dispatch from Topeka, where establishment Rs are terrified and Dems can‚Äôt believe their eyes &gt; https://t.co/EqqAzuJaEd https://t.co/7PmbNYdaL5
Hillary Clinton, whose midterm presence has mostly been behind-the-scenes this yr, is helping Michigan congressional candidate (and former aide) @HaleyLive with this robocall ahead of her primary tomorrow (Trump won the district by 4 in '16): https://t.co/uY3HbjwJT9
Ok yes, the biggest 2020 names aren't in Iowa yet. But! Some things don't change. The @DMRegister Soap Box @ the state fair in DSM is still bustling w potential (lesser known) Dem candidates this month: Bullock, Castro, Steyer, Delaney, Swalwell...
Kobach, clearly angling for a Trump tweet, called the Kemp endorsement "a brilliant move by the president." But is he going to get the nod in time for Tuesday's primary? "We shall see. I‚Äôll just leave it at that." https://t.co/EqqAzuJaEd
New, from Topeka: Don't look now, but Kris Kobach may be just steps away from becoming a governor, and one of Trump's most prominent allies on the national stage https://t.co/EqqAzuJaEd (@nymag)

@gabrielsherman For sure, that seems pretty clear. Just hard to imagine the DJT operation successfully ignoring a GOP challenger to focus on the D field unless the R primary is truly gadflyesque (which, again, is totally possible).
The problem with Bannon‚Äôs contention to @gabrielsherman that Trump is going to spend all of 2019 destroying the distracted Dem field (which, btw, they *are* worried about!) is how openly other Trump advisors acknowledge he may need to fight off a primary challenge first...

Also speaks volumes re shape of D power today that more+more of the left's nationally ambitious talent rises thru city leadership: if Kander runs for mayor, he's likely outta POTUS convo. But Garcetti (LA), Landrieu (NOrleans), Buttigieg (South Bend) remain, to varying degrees...
