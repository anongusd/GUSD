@Uncle_Sugar_ @ShelbyKStewart 2/2 One of the posts I made many times about #CovingtonCatholic was calling on the school &amp; church leaders to use the situation &amp; reaction to exemplify dialogue &amp; change about race relations for a country watching.  Instead they chose the path Dr. King describes. It disgusted me.
@Uncle_Sugar_ @ShelbyKStewart 1/1 Thank you for sharing Dr. King's wisdom.  I've been thinking a lot about him the past two years and our generation's need for leadership for civil rights. I must admit to you that while I don't see the that doxxing is successful, it isn't because I advocate quite moderation.
@Uncle_Sugar_ @ShelbyKStewart 2/2 Pls know @uncle_Sugar_ I am on your side and an advocate for human rights for all.  I just don't agree w/ the reaction on social media to enact the action of civility and equality in society we both want.
@Uncle_Sugar_ @ShelbyKStewart 1/1 Something has triggered anger from you towards me. While I started off denouncing racism in all its forms you seem to want to keep attacking me. I'm able to be civil &amp; concur that we disagree about doxxing people, for any reason, to be a successful form of enacting change.
@Uncle_Sugar_ @ShelbyKStewart You're entitled to your opinion but not to make assumptions or judge me. I've posted re: this a few times #BarabooHS #CovingtonCatholic when children were doxxed. Racism is a convo we all need to have to create change. I won't stop advocating for that change &amp; equality for all.
This is exactly where Trump should be exiled üëáüëáüëáüëá https://t.co/nEsQoXIv1h
@Uncle_Sugar_ @ShelbyKStewart Again, apologies for any misunderstanding. I just don't agree that doxxing is changing anything for the better &amp; we need societal leadership &amp; change. I'm not empathizing w/ this woman at all.  She threw up her phone to document which says more about her rooted depravity.
@Uncle_Sugar_ @ShelbyKStewart I'm sorry for your experience &amp; suffering. My intention in the post is to raise awareness &amp; question how we can change this mentality &amp; behavior not condone it, not give infamy or notoriety, not divide a society severely torn further. Simply, I'm asking what can we all do better?

@ShelbyKStewart 1/1 My experiences are similar yet reaction is different. Growing up in a low/middle class, predominantly white neighborhood where racism prevailed at times revealed to me more about fear, childish insecurity &amp; lack of empathy/education from fellow neighbors than anything else.

@mary_mnnng Dr. Maddow was brilliant &amp; deep as usual.  I fear this the most. Putting our justice &amp; defense system in a position that we get to martial law or they are weakened or forced to decide to act out against the President or do something he asks that is illegal.

@CJTS7006 @spider_ramone Yes... most of the posts I'm reading though are from adults internet doxxing these children. Yes, we must call out the behavior but be sensitive to how we invoke change. Stoning them, metaphorically, and giving all this attention isn't a solution to the problem.

@ChrisCuomo The President‚Äôs silence on Steve King‚Äôs continual racist overtures, on Karen Pence‚Äôs bigoted push to exacerbate homophobia indoctrinated children and admonishing educators who don‚Äôt subscribe is a scream of complicit agreement to those anti-American values.
@ChrisCuomo Karen Pence is exercising bigotry, hatred, prejudice &amp; trying to indoctrinate our children. That's neither constitutional nor Christian. Mrs. Pence, again, should practice that in silence as she is now on a public platform. As a Prof of Ed I'm more bothered by the school's policy
@ChrisCuomo She's wrong to advocate for her homophobic, evangelical agenda. As 1st Vice Lady she must represent separation from church in OUR systems. She's responsible to rep. the political values of OUR democracy or stay quietly in the kitchen w/ her bible until she's just Mrs. Pence again

@Taurean422 @Ban_Liberals @TheBreckWorsham The Bible, like the Torah, and the Qur‚Äôan (which are all more linked by Abrahamic tradition than different) are the essence of faith but are words interpreted by humans. It is meant as an interpretive text not a literal one. There are contradictions from various authors in them.

@Taurean422 @Ban_Liberals @TheBreckWorsham I have to disagree, my dear, religions are not toxic. Human beings using free will make ego driven choices at times. Some indoctrinated with falsehoods that are gross deformities of that ego (not a true higher power value) do very bad things 'in the name of'.
@Ban_Liberals @Taurean422 @TheBreckWorsham I'm a Catholic, educated from Jesuits. As a Christian believe God doesn't inform my decisions, my own free will does that for better or for worse. Choosing to honor &amp;  blindly follow anyone other than God is also blasphemy. Politicians are never higher powers nor should be.

@dankbros138 @MrsRabbitResist It is a deflection away from the crimes and POTUS in question. Obama isn't President, Hillary isn't President. The criminal Trump is &amp; should be #ImpeachTrump for high crimes &amp; misdemeanors now. That is fact. So is this, no President has committed crimes to this extent in history
@4mericanPsych0 @senatemajldr Geesh***
@4mericanPsych0 @senatemajldr I wish I knew how to educate the stupid.
@4mericanPsych0 What's a Q thread?
@dankbros138 @MrsRabbitResist Deflection and irrelevant.  All Presidents have had minor campaign violations found. A few thousand dollars from lack of oversight is not near millions.  None, none to this extent or this level or deplorable

@dankbros138 @MrsRabbitResist You're not worth arguing with, he is implicated in campaign finance laws, indicted by NYS for Trump Foundation fraud, and the list is continuing.  He will be impeached in the next couple months.
