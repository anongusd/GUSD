@AnthConey @joe_hinder @PatriotMarie @1MAGACarole @Keurig @dtcav @seanhannity Agree, plus the option to make so many other specialty coffee drinks too. Not to mention being able to make them using any coffee, no need for expensive specialty drink kcups. I love it. 😊
@joe_hinder @PatriotMarie @1MAGACarole @Keurig @dtcav @seanhannity I got sick of issues with Keurigs (went through 4 in 9 years due to pump issues etc). Bought one of the latest ninja coffee bars a few months ago and LOVE it!! Wouldn’t go back to Keurig for all of that and now due to pulling ads during hannity as well!
@catspadog Wanted to send pm but unable.Prefer to give info that way for various reasons.Will say that I am pro trump,pro law enforcement,pro military
