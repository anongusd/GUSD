‚ÄúWhat I want to do with my art is invite people into a conversation. Climate change is depressing! And for many it‚Äôs more like an abstract problem for the future... The purpose of my work is to remind us of nature, to appreciate it, and then to recognize it is disappearing now.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been an artist my entire life. My work ranges from playful cartoons to commercial illustration and oil painting. In the constant search for inspiration for my work, I am always asking myself what is important to me? And why?‚Äù

Martha McSally's support for the fossil fuel agenda is limiting Arizona's clean energy potential, contaminating the air we breathe, and exacerbating health disparities among Latinos, low-income families, and people of color.
McSally's long anti-environment voting record in the U.S. House earned her a spot on LCV Victory Fund's 2018 Dirty Dozen. She is the wrong choice to represent Arizona in the Senate.
Arizonans deserve a senator who will stand up for their health and communities, not a rubber stamp for corporate polluters and the Trump administration.
As a Congresswoman, Martha McSally has voted to make it easier to sell off public lands and to block safeguards against air pollution. Her anti-environment record has earned her an appalling lifetime score of 6% on LCV‚Äôs National Environmental Scorecard.

Climate change is an issue that demands immediate and bold action, and his votes as a U.S. senator have actually made the situation worse. Far from being part of the solution, he‚Äôs part of the problem.
Gardner has sought to block funding for climate science and even limit the Defense Department's ability to assess the impact climate change has on national security. And he has been silent on the dire warnings in the recent National Climate Assessment.
He also voted with the Koch brothers in opposition to the Clean Power Plan, repeatedly supported efforts to bar the EPA from reducing the pollution fueling climate change.
That‚Äôs just the beginning: Beyond ignoring climate science, Gardner has also consistently voted against solutions to the climate crisis. Notably, he voted to overturn commonsense limits on methane pollution ‚Äì a proposal that was modeled off of Colorado‚Äôs own leadership.
Gardner has repeatedly refused to accept climate science, even voting against an amendment recognizing the role humans play despite several other Republicans supporting the measure.
Make no mistake: Cory Gardner is no climate champion. Here are just some of the ways Gardner has worked against advancing climate progress. 	https://t.co/2ZSmEJ3Ruz

Alas, these greenwashers may very well be taking a cue from the Polluter-in-Chief, Trump himself. After questioning and downplaying the UN scientists‚Äô call for action, Trump had the nerve to say ‚ÄúI am truly an environmentalist.‚Äù ü§£ü§£ü§£
#IL06‚Äôs Peter Roskam thought that a photo-op hiking with an Illinois environmental group would counteract his efforts to dismantle actual environmental protections.
This list goes on! #CO06‚Äôs Mike Coffman initially pointed to his Climate Solutions Caucus membership when asked about his voting record, but has since given up attempting to defend his 250 anti-environment votes.
#MN03‚Äôs Erik Paulsen made protecting Minnesota‚Äôs Boundary Waters the theme of his first TV ad‚Ää -- yet he neglected to mention how he had just voted to cut $16 million from a program working to protect that very place.
#VA02‚Äôs Scott Taylor tried to portray himself as a champion for the Chesapeake Bay in a recent forum despite repeatedly voting against clean water and climate action.
And in Michigan, #MIGov candidate Bill Schuette acknowledged #climatechange yet *forgot* he just signed onto a legal brief denying climate science.
In Maine, warming waters are pushing lobsters farther north, jeopardizing the half-billion dollar lobster industry. So even #MEGov candidate Shawn Moody is now hedging his climate denial.
#FLSen candidate Rick Scott may be the worst offender, buying millions in airtime to convince voters he‚Äôll fight #redtide and the climate-fueled toxic algae crisis. But as governor, Scott banned the words #climatechange.
Or Mimi Walters in #CA45, who waited until the height of last summer‚Äôs wildfires to acknowledge that the disaster was ‚Äúfueled by climate change.‚Äù Too bad she‚Äôs voted against nearly every single attempt to address the climate crisis.
Take for example Dean Heller, who denied his own climate denial (while also ignoring his many votes against clean energy!) during the lone #NVSen debate.
