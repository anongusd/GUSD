As I approach the confirmation process, my main priority is to continue serving the people of Iowa with passion and energy #iagov
And I'm grateful for the prayers from Iowans that have encouraged me along the way #iagov
I'm also thankful for the friendships we have made in all 99 counties--friendships that we will always cherish #iagov
To my entire family, thank you for your sacrifice during my time in public service #iagov
And I'm extremely thankful for the most patient person in the state, my wife Chris, as she has served as First Lady with grace #iagov
I've been so blessed to serve as your Governor, leading the state that I love, for 22 years #iagov
By leading on water quality, we have an opp. to modernize our agriculture, create jobs, promote collaboration in urban and rural Iowa #iagov
I ask all Iowans to demand real change in the laws for distracted and impaired drivers #iagov
Modern technologies should come with new responsibilities #iagov
A troubling trend has begun to emerge that threatens Iowans' safety on our roads, deaths spiked from 315 in 2015 to 402 in 2016 #iagov
We all care deeply for the safety of our families, friends and our neighbors #iagov
That's why @IALtGov and I are calling for a comprehensive computer science initiative #iagov
The students here from #JacksonElementary, #Bondurant and #Waukee are counting on us to modernize our schools for the 21st century #iagov
Even with a tight budget, we should continue to prioritize initiatives that will grow our state's talent pipeline #iagov
We've set the #FutureReadyIA goal to better compete in an increasingly, knowledge-based, digital economy #iagov
More IA'ns have mental health access now; more IA'ns have health insurance; we've modernized our Medicaid system #iagov
My rec: $78.8 million for FY 18 and $63.5 million for FY 19 for schools--let's show we can meet the requirements in the first 30 days #iagov
Growing our state's talent pipeline needs to be a TOP priority #iagov
In IA, 90% of general fund is spent on K-12 education, Medicaid and employee wages and benefits #iagov
I'm asking the GA to take a comprehensive review of all boards and commissions and challenge the status quo!  #iagov #ialegis
We have made a commitment to examine every $ of revenue and expenditure #iagov
We can provide quality healthcare at a significantly lower cost and give local governments more flexibility to provide better wages #iagov
We have a smaller, smarter gov't, but while smaller and smarter, benefits for public employees have increased #iagov
It redirects family planning money to orgs that focus on health care for women and eliminates funding for orgs that perform abortions #iagov
For the coming biennium, I am presenting a complete 2-year budget that balances and meets our 5-year projections #iagov
I present my adjustments to you today:  no ATB cuts, no reduction in K-12, does not reduce property tax credits #iagov
But Iowa is a shining example of what hard work and smart, tough choices can do for growing businesses and nurturing families #iagov
This new GA brings new dynamics, new expectations and new opportunities to deliver positive results for Iowans #iagov
And while I'm pleased with this progress and optimistic, there is more work to be done.  We must seize the opportunities before us!  #iagov
We just set an all-time record for #Ethanol, #Biodiesel and lead the nation in % of electricity generated by wind (35%) #iagov
In total, IA has 6,100 manufacturers who contribute more than $31 BILLION to Iowa's economy #iagov
Today, at the COS, we have leaders from #Bloomfield, #Woodbine and #Waterloo--please join me in congratulating their success #iagov
The ability of Iowans to overcome challenges bolsters my optimism for our state's future #iagov
I'm proud to say that every public school system in Iowa is now enrolled in the Teacher Leadership System #iagov
Together, we've made progress toward our goal of restoring Iowa's schools to best in the nation #iagov
The state has helped attract $13.5 BILLION in private-sector capital investment #aigov
We've seen our unemployment rate drop from 6.2% to 3.8% since 2011 #iagov
We have provided significant tax relief for Iowans the past 5 years, especially for commercial property tax payers #iagov
We've made tough decisions to give Iowans a smaller and smarter government #iagov
As I look back on my years, I'm thankful for those Iowans who have served in the military, law enforcement or as first responders #iagov
I'm honored and humbled to address a joint session of the General Assembly delivering the COS for the final time as your Governor #iagov

This ruling creates trillions in new government spending and debt that we cannot afford. #FullRepeal
Health care costs continue to rise, despite the promises that were made w/new gov't rules and regs. #FullRepeal
Only #FullRepeal can end this damage and stop things from getting worse.
Our goal is to be the healthiest state. A massive tax increase forced on us by the Courts is not the answer. #FullRepeal
Americans must remain vigilant in the fight to repeal the federal takeover of health care #FullRepeal http://t.co/cDU64Bm6
