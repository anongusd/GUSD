@Steffi_Cole Perhaps, also Jefferson who was a big term limits stalwart wasnt present to advocate for them. But thank you, @AP4Liberty is a tried and true champion of term limits. What's your greatest reason for congressional term limits Austin?
@Steffi_Cole Thank you for asking :) üóΩüá∫üá∏‚ù§ #HappyNationalTermLimitsDay
@Steffi_Cole Or through the states. Article V of the Constitution defines how amendments can be made. Ironically the Articles of Confederation did in fact have term limits for Congress, but weren't adopted into our current Constitution.
@Steffi_Cole Precisely because if it doesn't apply to everyone it might not truly work. We see both sides of that argument though in that states should have the right to term limit their own rep/sen. Check out US Term Limits v Thornton. Other than that, by passing a con amendment via Congress
@AV52621424 @maziehirono https://t.co/UBrUJ6ZZ57

How much choice do voters get when they only have a choice of one? Term limits open up seats. It is a proven fact that open seat elections bring more choices in candidates and increase voter engagement. If the incumbent wins 95% of the time, there is no choice. https://t.co/cXcOz844Jq

@Dude3000 @craigcalcaterra That term limits create competitive open seat elections, there are hardly competitive open seat elections in places without term limits.

@jimmyshi03 Ok but that's another issue then, isn't it?
@Dude3000 @craigcalcaterra That has nothing to do with behavior "dude", he's been in office since the early 70's let alone Speaker. The man hasn't had a close election in decades.
@Digmyearth @craigcalcaterra üôÑ
@jimmyshi03 Sensible people don't run in elections they know they're going to lose Jim.
@craigcalcaterra 3. This is strictly opinion based. Not saying the Ohio legislature is necessarily good (check out our eight is enough campaign from 2014), but this is isn't an argument against term limits.
@craigcalcaterra 2. Wouldn't you rather a politician seek another job instead of having the same one for 30+ years? I.e. Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer
@craigcalcaterra 1. Anyone being elected to office for the first time is an amateur. However there are over 500k elected officials in the country, so there's experience, but it doesn't have to come from inside.
@Dude3000 @craigcalcaterra We never listed behavior patterns, you just said that yourself. Sound logic.
@jimmyshi03 Ok, but why would someone choose to run against an incumbent who has a 95% of winning automatically
@craigcalcaterra You don't need to sub tweet everything to get your point across unless your point of debating is just to make yourself feel good.
@craigcalcaterra You're fundamentally misunderstanding the purpose of TL, to create competitive open seat elections. Take Michigan for example, they have the shortest TL for a state leg its the ONLY state where EVERY election is contested. In states without TL dozens of elections never take place
@jimmyshi03 Are uncontested elections anti democratic? ü§î
@craigcalcaterra You must've missed our last tweet where we pointed you to the Illinois Legislature, try New York too while you're at it, where no statewide offices have term limits along with the legislature. Don't forget about Congress too!

@BrutusBeaber @MelissaAckison The only way to term limit Congress is through an amendment to the Constitution. The process for making amendments is through Article V of the U.S. Constitution.

@presentdayguard Exactly. That's what everyone is saying to do... just vote out the incumbent. We don't believe that works. You are making our point for us (we're on the same page). The only way to do this is with #termlimits.

@janenb @HeartlandInst This argument is based in the notion that incoming legislators will be entirely unqualified for their jobs and will be easily led astray. In reality those elected will have experience with policy making and dealing with staffers. Some may even bring their own staffers. #UnclogDC
@janenb @HeartlandInst With all due respect, the experience entrenched incumbents get cozying up to special interests is not exactly productive. Staffers already have strong input especially w/politicians in office well into their 70-80s. They occupy committee positions long after they have lost touch.

@rsamplecom A true #Statesman does not stop being such when he is no longer in elected office. The fact is...most statesmen will never have a chance to be elected to office due to status quo, establishment puppets occupying the same seat for half a century.

Want fairer elections? Take 1/3 of the money out of the race by removing the incumbent who spends on avg $1.5M. Challengers raise $250K. But in open seat elections, each candidate raises $600K on avg. More candidates. More accessibility. More equal fundraising = Fairer elections. https://t.co/rt3zQOczDw

RT @HouseTermLimits: 1 week left to RSVP to hear our Co-Chair @RepRodBlum discuss #TermLimits with @RandPaul @RepBetoORourke @KenCuccinelli‚Ä¶
@WaywardSteve @quitthedems @rhsibley So you support #TermLimits on the judicial branch...and the executive branch? Just not the legislative branch? ü§î
@quitthedems The enemy is already doing it...and we don't have to sit here like "frogs in the pot" while we watch tyranny continue to use fear to scare us into inaction. You can. We won't be.
@quitthedems @WaywardSteve @rhsibley The best way is to vote them out. However....how long will we sit back and allow a congressional approval rating of around 15% and an incumbent re-election rate of over 90%? Can't do the same thing and expect different results. WE THE PEOPLE are in control of THIS. Let's do it!

@donttreadonme53 We tested the possibility of a limited Term Limits only convention based on the fact that s balanced budget convention WOULD open the door for erosion of the Constitution in FL with success. This year we already have 4 more committed with the likelihood of 11 more this session.
@quitthedems @WaywardSteve @rhsibley We do know. It's our job to know. *SPOILER ALERT* It's NOT good. Their agenda is to expand Government intrusion into our economic and social freedoms in the name of security.
We are very protective of the U.S. Constitution at USTL and we do not advocate for an #ArticleV convention which would leave the door open to its destruction. Learn more about amendment convention myths here --&gt; https://t.co/GRKWXSkE30 https://t.co/tOWtzCf0Sm

@quitthedems @WaywardSteve @rhsibley I do know that a lot of that "BIG MONEY" the states have, is simply trickled down from the Fed's and it's used to bribe states to follow "Big Government's" agenda. Get Federal $$ out of the states and then MAYBE we can pretend we "DON'T KNOW".
@quitthedems @rhsibley Big money controls ALL politics.
We are being played folks. Time to end the gravy train and term limit Congress out of office. It's time to hit the reset button and start over. #TermLimits #ArticleV https://t.co/gZbdMlDlDq
@quitthedems @WaywardSteve @rhsibley Once the Term Limits Convention applications get to Congress, there is no wiggle room for legislators to insert agenda items. Their role of convention caller is ministerial, and they are only allowed to choose between two options for ratification.

@rights_state The executive does have #TermLimits. So, are you saying that makes that branch stronger? Sounds like it. In that case we most definitely need to balance power by setting term limits for every branch.

@rights_state @shakhill We realize there are many problems, most having their roots in 1912-1913. Before fighting for a repeal of the 17th we would want to ensure state legislatures are true citizen legislatures.
@RarefiedLevin @COSProject We do hang out with them. ;) We are friends with all defenders of Liberty.
@RarefiedLevin @COSProject Correct. There are many issues. None of which our current congress are addressing. So we are concentrating our resources into #TermLimits so we can replace congress. Brick by brick....
@rights_state @shakhill We agree. We just believe that having a strong leg. does not equate to allowing lobby sponsored politicians to remain in office for 20+ years. A fresh, young legislator is a stronger representative for the people. If it was working the approval rate of congress would be higher.
@RarefiedLevin @COSProject We are "with it at the State level" and we are advocating for an #ArticleV amendment convention which is what @COSProject is doing as well. We support them and all groups advocating for #TermLimits
@rights_state @shakhill It's somewhat hypocritical of your purpose to say you want something in "every state" when you are allegedly for "States Rights".
