Lack of coverage or representation allows misconceptions to sow, especially in parts of the country where Latinos are new neighbors. Without informed news coverage providing context, it creates vacuum &amp; an opportunity for a demagogue to rise who feeds on people‚Äôs fears.

Pew calculates total eligible voters 27m &amp; actual voters (12.7m). They miss the critical link: how many are REGISTERED &amp; vote.

14 yrs ago, @votolatino saw this future &amp; built towards this moment despite naysayers. Focused on tech, we registered 2,400 voters in 2004. Last week, we registered a record 202,339. Gracias mi gente! When outreach is done, you rise - proving how deeply we care for our country.
90% of Latinx under 18yrs are US born citizens. 1 million will become eligible to vote each yr for next 10yrs. Median age of fellow white American is 54. For a Latinx, it‚Äôs 18. President‚Äôs trumped up EO of revoking citizenship is aimed at us. He‚Äôs too late. We‚Äôre here. We vote.

I encourage news outlets to focus on what‚Äôs on the ballot: healthcare, healthcare, healthcare. GOP incumbents who ran on eliminating the AC√Å and now claim they care about pre-existing conditions. Or gun safety, choice, family separation. Focus on voter suppression. That‚Äôs helpful
Another sideshow: President peddling meddling w the Constitution which guarantees birthright citizenship. He can‚Äôt. 30 countries guarantee it too. Red meat for his base. Notion makes us less secure by creating a permanent underclass. Been there, done that. Stay focused - vote.

Detaining children escaping violence in detention tents in the middle of the desert away from public scrutiny to feed a $2 billion for-profit funded by tax dollars is a stain on us. Studies prove that longer held, depression rises. #MidtermElections register to vote.

Congress needs to pass immigration relief even knowing Trump won‚Äôt sign it. It needs to be on record for future generation that they weren‚Äôt complicit during this moment in our history.	The world is watching.
Oh, Border Patrol has separated over 700 children from parents seeking asylum, overbooked at detention centers kids will be housed on military bases.		@UN has declared we are in violation of human rights.
Banking, retail are down in immigrant communities who are afraid to spend, to walk outside. Target shared 11% drop in revenue along border states last year 		800,000 DACA recipients lives are in limbo.
Trump has revoked revoked documented status to over 100,000 and is on track to make close to half a million undocumented in the next two years		Universities, hospitals and other high tech industries are being denied visas for their talent
@ICEgov is racially profiling passengers on Grey Hound. At Motel 6. At 7-Elevens.		Sec DeVos encouraged schools to call ICE though it‚Äôs unconstitutional		A Tennessee factory raided, and 500 school kids were absent the next day	 Teachers report kids biting fingers until they bleed
16m Americans living in mixed status families are facing terror, anguish and trauma that they may not see their loved ones come this evening.		Border patrol is detaining US citizens for speaking Spanish - a language that 41m people speak in America.
Congress is complicit to Trump agenda by not passing some sort of reform to give millions relief who have lived here for decades.		#ICE in many parts of the country has gone rogue as described by veteran agents.	There are 16m Americans who live in mixed status families.
Let‚Äôs discuss it. 		Administration is violating civil liberties under the guise of immigration reform &amp; national security.		Trump, Miller, Sessions, Nielsen, Homan, &amp; Kelly are pursuing an extreme white nationalist agenda. Congress is complicit by not passing some sort of reform. https://t.co/ukosr94l7O

In 2016, we registered a record 39k, 77% who voted &amp; were disproportionately 1st time TX voters. This primary in El Paso we ran a pilot w 2 college chapters, registered over 700 new voters in 2 weeks &amp; contacted over 16k voters under 35. We worked our hearts out thx to you.
TX made us proud! @votolatino started work there since 2010 bc we saw record of young Latinos coming of age. We‚Äôve been there despite establishment consultants saying we were wasting our time &amp; telling donors not to fund us. Our small donors- you made this possible!
