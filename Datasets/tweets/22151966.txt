@vmorkevicius Agree that it's an interesting topic, but at least according to US intel agencies, the purported election interference wasn't hacktivism, but an intel operation ordered by Putin (Putin would beg to differ, of course)
This is all just extraordinary.
Putin says "final conclusion" on election interference can only be delivered by a trial, by a court, not by law enforcement
Putin was "extremely strong and powerful" in his denial - thinks Putin's offer to ask his own intel officers Qs an "incredible offer"
Trump says he has "confidence in both parties" - referring to the US intel community and RUSSIA over whether election meddling happened. What.
Asked a v direct q about Russian interference, called to condemn Russian actions, Trump immediately pivots to "where is the server" talk
And the President just tossed a soccer ball towards the First Lady.

"Our militaries do get a long" perhaps better than civilian leaders, Trump says of Russia and US in Syria
Putin invites Mueller's team to Russia to witness questioning of intel officers involved in meddling, but then says Russia gets to be there when US questions people in US who they think have done illegals things -- name drops Bill Browder (high-profile Kremlin critic)
Putin says US-Russia has specific legal procedures for extradition, says Mueller can send an official request to Russia - our enforcement "perfectly able to do this questioning" and send material to US
Putin says there's "no evidence" when it comes to "actual facts"; says he will "look into" the 12 intel officers who Mueller charged
Putin, standing next to Trump, asks reporter to name "a single fact that would definitively prove collusion," calls it "nonsense"
Trump: "There was no collusion, I didn't know the president, there was no one to collude with."
Trump says "it's ridiculous" what's going on with the probe
Trump calls Putin a "good competitor" and stops to make sure it's clear that's a "compliment"
that was last year, he said
Trump says US warned Russia about a terror plot in St. Petersburg, warning allowed Russian security forces to stop it "cold"
Trump: "spent a great deal of time" talking about Russian meddling in US elections, says Putin "has an interesting idea"
Trump says even during the Cold War the US and Russia maintained a "strong dialogue." ... That's one way to put it.
.@realDonaldTrump: "deeply productive dialogue, went very well."

POTUS actually gets into this a lot, saying “in my opinion” before stating something that is objectively true or false. Ex: when he says that “in my opinion” NYT or WaPo sources don’t exist. That’s not an opinion, that’s a claim of fact, which is a different thing.
Heart of this problem is the difference between objective &amp; subjective truth. 1+1=2 is objectively true.

For any other admin, the president would've made like four A1 headline quotes in this speech so far. But here it's just a Thursday.
"No matter where there's a problem, there's Iran right behind it. And we're not going to have that any longer."
And then re-affirms commitment to Article 5 (mutual defense), which he famously didn't do at NATO meeting in May 2017 (but then did in July)
Trump calling out Germany for not paying NATO obligation

Odd wrinkle in modern warfare/geopolitics - the US is going to sleep soon, so Syria/Iran/Russia get a head start on the information ops. Maybe that's why Mattis/Dunford were so relatively open at the briefing. First salvo in the info war
CNN reports that operation took ~70 minutes total
Sorry, that Fars news, not Tehran Times

Since I started tweeting about #SyriaStrikes... #creepytwitter https://t.co/1y22866Bdn
Mattis says US anticipates a robust disinformation campaign with those aligned with Assad
Mattis says targets were picked to degrade chemical weapons (in response to Q about whether any strikes targeted Assad personally)
Dunford: not aware of any Russian activity in response to strikes
Dunford says he's not aware if Syrians moved chem weapons over last few days
Mattis: "We used a little over double the number of weapons this year than we did last year." (you're welcome, headline writers, twice as big.)
Dunford: "We used the normal deconfliction channels to deconflict the airspace that we were using" but didn't say what US was doing; "They [the Russians] may not have found anything unusual" about it
Dunford says he's not aware if US targeted Syrian air defenses that responded during op
Mattis says that he saw evidence *yesterday* that Assad was responsible for chemical attack (Ed note: maybe it came from the French?)
Dunford confirms there were manned aircraft involved in the Syria strike
Dunford: "We chose these particular targets to mitigate the risk of civilian casualties" and bc they were associated with chemical program, also looked at collateral damage
Mattis: "Right now we have no additional attacks planned."
Dunford: US used deconfliction line prior to strike, but didn't tell Russians what they were doing in the air
Mattis says he is "absolutely confident" that Assad conducted the chem attack, says US has the intel to back-up the strike
"We specifically identified these targets to mitigate the risk of Russian forces being involved," Dunford says. but didn't do any coordination w Russians, didn't notify them
Dunford says US has already completed its part of the operation
"Right now we have no reports of [American] losses" in the operation, Mattis says
"Right now this is a one-time shot," says Mattis, but it depends on if Assad continues to use chem weapons
That last one was Dunford, not Mattis
US: target 1: scientific research center - used to research and develop chem weapons, target 2: chem weapons storage facility, 3rd: chem weapons storage and command post
"I want to emphasize that these strikes are directed at the Syrian regime" - says "we" have gone to "great lengths" to avoid civilian and foreign casualties (seems like that last part meant for Iran and esp Russia)
Mattis: "Clearly the Assad regime did not get the message last year. This time, [the US] and our allies have struck harder."
Mattis at the podium: "We and our allies find these atrocities inexcusable." Says Trump has Article 2 authorities to defend "important" US national interests
Sputnik: "By conducting strikes on Syria, the US violate all international norms, and #Russia views this as an act of aggression, says Alexander Sherin, chairman of the State Duma Defense Committee."

FWIW, it's 4:15am in Damascus and Moscow right now, 5:45 in Tehran. A lot of people being woken up I would guess #Syria

Immediately after announcing strikes in #Syria, #Trump already making a case for leaving Middle East - "It is a troubled place... the fate of the region lies in the hands of its own people."
"America does not seek an indefinite presence in #Syria" - Trump
Trump: "Hopefully someday we'll get along with #Russia, or maybe even #Iran... but maybe not."
"To Iran and to Russia, I ask: What kind of a nation wants to be associated w the mass murderer of men, women and children?"
"We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents"
"These are not the actions of a man, they are the crimes of a monster instead." - #Trump on Assad's chem attacks
#Trump announces strikes on chem weapons facilities in Syria, combined op w France and UK. "Now underway"

Well that's it for this brief tour of the letters sent to the judge ahead of #Libby's sentencing in 2007. Overall, most of the letters were from powerful people in support of Libby w a few "normal' people who wanted harsh sentence. Still, letters in support were pretty convincing
And former CIA director James Woolsey: https://t.co/I7lbWQ3bqo

If anyone's looking for a long list of Scooter Libby's pretty powerful friends, the letters in support of him ahead of sentencing in 2007 make a pretty good resource: https://t.co/qRJpz5pd5R
Bolton's letter references the challenges post-9/11 to say that "in the face of all these demands" no one can be expected to keep classified info straight. "If there is anyone who fully understands our 'system' for protecting classified information, I have yet to meet him." https://t.co/iKKlpGKl02
