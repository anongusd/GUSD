The challenge/reality: 		If I prayed as much as I complained, worried or planned on my own life would be much, much clearer and easier.		But I choose to typically avoid this reality.		It's something to work on! 		Can I get an amen?
No matter what you're facing, you are NOT alone. 		Stop, pray, seek, turn to God. He created you, loves you and is there for you.		"But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us." -Romans 5:8

@geoffdua I am not a Republican, so I won't sit around defending them. But are you arguing the right hasn't attempted to defend life? Because...that would be a weird argument.
Seems it's pretty clear one side of the debate is embracing a lie: that life isn't created by God, that the unborn (with beating hearts and monumental potential) don't matter, aren't important and should simply be disposed of at will.

So, brush it off, pray for wisdom and engage people based on logic and fact. Lead with faith and pray it pays off. People are free to think we're "clowns." Who cares? Our goal is to try and help others discover Christ/grace/redemption. Everything else is background noise.
We shouldn't be shocked or angry when people come out and say "you're a Christian, so close your mouth." We should expect this. Biblical morals don't always mesh well with modern culture, but our reaction matters. Rather than lash out, remember: Jesus said this would happen.
That kind of pushback is pretty lazy, though, and it should be called out. It was particularly intriguing that this took place on someone's post about the importance of speaking out against bigotry. Many, of course, failed to see the irony. But, while we note the silliness...
This past week, I had two people in 1 thread tell me my views don't matter because I "write for Jesus" and because "Christians who are pro-life are clowns." I'm not complaining. But it's a wake-up call: culture will get harder to speak truth into. We must get better at doing it.

@DrJenGunter Jennifer, I wasn‚Äôt trying to be rude. I actually reached out privately as well because I wanted to seek your expert opinion. I was validating what you said about maternal murder because it‚Äôs been quite an issue here in NY. Wasn‚Äôt trying to be rude.
@BrowofJustice @tnicholsmd @sheologian @NBL2006 @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres What I would want to know is why delivery would be entirely impossible and why abortion is the definitive and only option in those cases. From a medical perspective understanding that would be helpful.
@DrJenGunter @TheOtherParas @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Jennifer, this was actually one of the issues being debated surrounding the NY law.
@BrowofJustice @tnicholsmd @sheologian @NBL2006 @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Just so you understand the very specific issue I was addressing.
@BrowofJustice @tnicholsmd @sheologian @NBL2006 @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Again, the rare circumstances I was referencing were specific examples of women who had healthy viable fetuses and who themselves were so ill an abortion was the only option.
@TheOtherParas @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres @DrJenGunter Not at all looking to troll. There weren‚Äôt examples past 24 weeks where fetuses were healthy.
Thanks! https://t.co/m6yY0rUwp0
@sheologian @tnicholsmd @NBL2006 @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Hmm. Okay.
@BrowofJustice @tnicholsmd @sheologian @NBL2006 @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres I never required convincing. I questioned healthy babies being aborted due to maternal issues past 24 weeks.
@sheologian @tnicholsmd @NBL2006 @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres No one should harass women outside of a clinic. I don‚Äôt disagree. Also: no one asked you to defend your theological views. True tolerance doesn‚Äôt get one so riled...
@EyeEdinburgh @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres You seem tolerant.
@sheologian @tnicholsmd @NBL2006 @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Jesus would have been an abortion escort?
@DrKJStanley @ErinsVB @tnicholsmd You don‚Äôt know about Gosnell?
@tnicholsmd @ErinsVB That‚Äôs not really the point, no. I do worry they create loopholes that will be potentially exploited.
@tnicholsmd @sheologian @NBL2006 @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Huh? I wasn‚Äôt attacking anyone and I repeatedly expressed sympathy for those who struggle with fetal health scenarios.
@tnicholsmd @ErinsVB We do have at least one study with a small sample size no? You discussed it earlier.
@kohnemily @zandze @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres That‚Äôs an oversimplification. Consider a woman who was abused and her unborn baby died as a result. That death is no longer a homicide. That is another way of looking at it. It‚Äôs tragic.
@tnicholsmd @ErinsVB What‚Äôs the purpose of the induction?
@tnicholsmd @ErinsVB So do you deny that people have optional abortions in the third trimester?
@tnicholsmd @ErinsVB Again, I focused strictly (and I keep saying this) on cases where the mother has an issue and the fetus is healthy.
@MollyBrown28 @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Source?
@tnicholsmd @ErinsVB Which amounts to over 10,000 per year. That 1 percent looks quite different in that form.
@tnicholsmd @ErinsVB Trying to find them! The induction question: is the purpose of the induction to save the baby or attempt to? I really am not concerned with addressing pre-viable scenarios with my original question. But I wouldn‚Äôt necessary consider that an abortion (depends on goal).
@davequast @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres @DrJenGunter No problem! I am not looking to argue with anyone. Just dialogue.
@DrKJStanley @ErinsVB @tnicholsmd Kenneth, just so I can explain: my initial concern is the NY law and the vagueness of its language for post-viable abortions. That‚Äôs all I was speaking about.
@tnicholsmd @ErinsVB But this would indicate third trimester abortions happen for non medical reasons no?
@davequast @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres @DrJenGunter Her feed mostly focuses on fetal abnormalities. I didn‚Äôt see examples of healthy babies with sick moms past 24 weeks. Did I miss some?
@DrKJStanley @LeahNTorres @tnicholsmd @NBL2006 @sheologian @marrenefranich Again, you missed my earlier messages.
@DrKJStanley @LeahNTorres @tnicholsmd @NBL2006 @sheologian @marrenefranich I think you‚Äôre misunderstanding and mixing some messages together. No, I didn‚Äôt say I think you poison healthy babies.
@DrKJStanley @LeahNTorres @tnicholsmd @NBL2006 @sheologian @marrenefranich Not true.

@LeahNTorres @tnicholsmd @NBL2006 @sheologian @marrenefranich It does. I am still not convinced on the rare circumstances. Is there a source of reading you'd recommend on them? But I appreciate you engaging and sharing. Would love to do a podcast with you at some point and have a respectful conversation about all of this.
@tnicholsmd @NBL2006 @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Is it possible to deliver a healthy baby?
@tnicholsmd @NBL2006 @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Taylor, it's hard to discuss this via Twitter, but I think we all know there are truly tragic circumstances. My area of concern has been late-term viable babies.
@tnicholsmd @Honda753 @DrKJStanley @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres So...trying to save the baby?
@etcpolitics They can happen in the third trimester in New York. So, this is inaccurate. The new law says after 24 weeks if health or life of the mother is threatened.
@NBL2006 @tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Why, in that case, would it not be an emergency birth? I'm genuinely asking.
@Honda753 @DrKJStanley @tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres If there is a threat to the woman's health or life, the law says yes. Unless I'm misreading something?
@marrenefranich @NBL2006 @tnicholsmd @sheologian @LeahNTorres I never said that...
@NBL2006 @tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Just to clarify: I was always speaking of babies who are healthy. I totally understand the complexities and heartbreak. That's not what I was referring to.
@DrKJStanley @tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Not really.
@NBL2006 @tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Sure, but if it happens at 26 weeks, wouldn't you try and save the baby still?
@tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres I never said I specialize in the way abortions are performed. So, not sure why you'd assume that.
@LeahNTorres I think you and I would part on this front: I believe once the baby is viable it deserves some protections.
@tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres You're a little condescending on this front. I've actually asked doctors. I'm not a doctor. And I think it's silly to tell me to become one to receive an answer that you should be able to easily give. Isn't that why we have experts?
@LeahNTorres I guess because you're dealing with another fully, formed life. These situations are complex for sure, but I still think in most cases you'd attempt to save both lives if a child is viable. Especially that far along. But, Leah, I truly appreciate your engagement here.
@NBL2006 @tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres This is a bit different from what I was speaking on but so sad.
@tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Digoxin and a very graphic procedure that follows?
@tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Many babies born at 25 weeks are fine. Most women, I'd think, would take the chance at that point. I have numerous friends born at 24 weeks who are fine.
@LeahNTorres Well, it seems New York was concerned about it, because the state has said that there are instances that women need abortions past 24 weeks to save the life of the mother or protect her health.
@tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Why wouldn't you induce?
@DrDGrossman @DrWillieParker @SELFmagazine Have you had examples of women past 24 weeks who have completely healthy fetuses but who absolutely need an abortion (rather than delivery)?
@LeahNTorres @DrJenGunter @DrDGrossman I have. None of the examples were healthy babies from what I saw. Not trying to be difficult! Please correct me if I'm wrong.
@tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Right this isn't what I'm speaking about. Again, past viability. She was 17 weeks. So, doesn't meet the standard of the NY law issue I've raised incessantly for weeks.
@zandze @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Perfect! yes, sorry. That's what I've been saying. My concern has been that the NY law seems to believe there is a reason past 24 weeks to terminate based on the woman's life...I'm a little troubled by that based on this reality.
@tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres She was 17 weeks pregnant. That's not post-viable...
Again, which conditions? It's crazy that none of you have any examples to point to... https://t.co/iEnQewQHzY
@tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres You wouldn't need to if the baby was viable...
@zandze @baddgrl_ @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres It still doesn't address viability but sure.
@tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Well that's just bizarre. I wouldn't consider that an abortion as the baby had already died. I get that the medical procedure is an "abortion," but I'm speaking about a healthy fetus who allegedly must be terminated...this is quite different.
@tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres AGAIN, do you know specific examples. "Woman A had this condition and in her circumstance with a healthy fetus at 29 weeks she absolutely needed an abortion to save her life."
@tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres I don't think it's insane to ask if this is ever absolutely necessary. The fact that no one can address that is troubling, especially when there are laws on the books now saying that it might be necessary and that a woman's life is definitely threatened past viability.
Not trying to medicine. I'm asking what specific healthcare examples exist in which a woman who has a healthy and viable fetus would absolutely need an abortion. No need to be condescending. I'm asking. I have been for days. I assume I won't receive a list of real-life examples? https://t.co/fSCMo9WJzO
@zandze @baddgrl_ @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Apologies -- that was what I have been speaking about for two days (after viability). I was not trying to be difficult. I absolutely understand the conditions in that document. And there are some tragic scenarios.
@tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Of course. But why would you need to do that if a baby is viable? You'd simply deliver the healthy baby and treat the woman's condition, no?
@tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres That's fair. Though it's hard to come by actual examples. Most doctors speak in 30K foot level about this. What are the specific instances (disorders) that would absolutely necessitate an abortion that late when the fetus is otherwise healthy...
@baddgrl_ @zandze @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Well, we know about 10,000-12,000 late-term per year in the US. Not looking for a fight...
@tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Basically: is it life or death? Must it happen? I think you know what I mean.
@tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Thanks for this. But what about 27 weeks, 28? Isn't there a point where an abortion simply wouldn't be required?
@tnicholsmd @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Taylor, I'm not trying to be contentious. Do you know of examples of women who have healthy fetuses but are past 24 weeks and desperately need abortions as the only option? Genuinely curious.
@marrenefranich @pistrix @sheologian @LeahNTorres Not really all that confusing. It's called faith.
Wait, what? A fetus is not a colony might be a better example. This is unhelpful. https://t.co/fEgtyEcVjI
@OHFScratch This is my focus for sure.
@TheOtherParas @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres @DrJenGunter Yes, I've asked both for specifics and would love to chat with them.
@DrKJStanley @LeahNTorres I'm not trying to be contentious here. I'd like to DM you, in fact, if you'd allow it.
Not at all. I am more than open. Every time I've questioned the past 24 weeks mark no one has given an answer. One person said "bleeding out," but she's not a doctor. I'd love to honestly receive an explanation from a professional. https://t.co/C6rCr0P493
@jayrale @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Very insightful!
@FikeMartin @ameliabonow @Ashadahya Huh? You people keep walking in mid-conversation. I was not speaking about fetal abnormalities. Try reading back a bit. Also: try treating other humans like, you know, humans. Weird.
@LTock @ameliabonow @Ashadahya Again, I was saying I didn't know it happened to her, as I had no idea who she was until yesterday. This isn't complex. I was kind and explained that no one deserves that treatment. I've been covering these issues for years and I'm well aware of these stories.
@LTock @jaspar Are you confusing the fact that he had unlicensed staff? He was a licensed doctor, no? His license was suspended in 2010.
@FikeMartin @ameliabonow @Ashadahya Dude, I've been strictly speaking about late-term abortion, so...
@zandze @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres No, this addresses abortions later in pregnancy not specifically after viability, which is what I've been speaking about. If a baby is viable and healthy, why is abortion the answer?
@LTock @ameliabonow @Ashadahya NO, I was speaking about not knowing HER story. My goodness. You people jump from one conclusion to another.
Those publications offer conditions regarding a mother‚Äôs health after 24 weeks that would necessitate an abortion on an otherwise healthy and viable baby?‚Äô https://t.co/Q5SdcmNp0U

@kohnemily @sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres I understand that. But what is the danger? What specific condition requires a woman to have an abortion if her fetus is completely healthy at, say, 25 weeks?
@kohnemily @LeahNTorres I think we know it has happened in at least one clinic. The potential that it could happen under the law, alone, is enough for us to ask and explore.

@sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres C-section wouldn‚Äôt be possible?
@sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres So, you‚Äôre saying that without a doubt these women absolutely need an abortion past 24 weeks ‚Äî that there‚Äôs no other way to save the life of a healthy baby? And that doctors would back this claim (so far not one has). Abortions can also involve bleeding, no?
@sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres I‚Äôm still not getting why birth isn‚Äôt an option past 24 weeks. Bleeding is a factor either way, no?
@jourdak You‚Äôre also talking about a very, very small country. Coping with problems among a population the size of the greater NYC area is quite different from grappling with 300+ million people. Still, worth looking at!
@sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres I‚Äôve spent years looking it up and asking doctors. So, here we go again...no evidence outside of a random claim. If there is a case, share it. If not, it is hard to believe.
@jourdak Sure, people should look at what they are doing. Doesn‚Äôt really invalidate anything I‚Äôve said either way...
@sheologian @marrenefranich @LeahNTorres Links? This is the first time I‚Äôve heard this claim but I definitely want to know more. I‚Äôm genuinely curious.

@marrenefranich @LeahNTorres So it isn‚Äôt a matter of an acceptable condition...it‚Äôs a matter of me not being able to find one example where an abortion was needed past 24 weeks for a viable and healthy baby even if the mother is ill.
@marrenefranich @LeahNTorres I‚Äôm trying to understand why a healthy fetus that could simply be delivered would need to be aborted if it is viable. Most doctors have told me in this case the child would simply be born and the mother treated since it is past viability.
@LeahNTorres I guess what I‚Äôm asking is: what are these other conditions in the vastness of medicine? Not one doctor in the course of 10 years of covering this has named any. And I genuinely have sought the answer.
Nah, I‚Äôll keep defending life. I‚Äôm a fan of free speech. https://t.co/0h5ZMDm41m
No one should be threatened. https://t.co/jEUPggOMBi
@LeahNTorres Also, I very much appreciate your response. Truly. I know this is complicated. What other conditions would apply here? If a baby is healthy and viable wouldn‚Äôt the baby simply be delivered in some form if a woman is having a health issue past 24 weeks?
@LeahNTorres In this case, it would seem the fetus isn‚Äôt viable (ie smallness)? I understand that most of these pregnancies are wanted. I am just skeptical that there are cases of women 25 was plus who have a health issue that requires an abortion over a birth of some sort (pending viability)
I‚Äôm not grasping at any straws. I‚Äôm asking if you‚Äôre 100 percent sure there are no other Gosnells? I‚Äôm sure you would have denied his existence before 2013. I am not certain there are others, but I have to wonder... https://t.co/FFhIHHBxOv
@Echo4Resistance @AOC These all seem to be stories about baby abnormalities. Are there any late term stories about mothers who have issues past 24 weeks?
In fairness: Gosnell operated a clinic out in the open. The government didn‚Äôt do its job. Are you so sure there aren‚Äôt more Gosnell? PA doesn‚Äôt have the strictest abortion laws, so what is the point here exactly? https://t.co/k5w1oTdsjG

Right, do the math. We're still talking about 10,000-12,000 late-term abortions a year. Every life matters, no? https://t.co/Rl1ZZepqjV
I said laws don't always change hearts. Also, the left is taking this extreme example of 9 month abortions. The reality is: the issue is LATE-TERM abortion of viable babies. There's not much data on it, so neither side can claim they know the reasons why these abortions happen. https://t.co/MX1xMQDxMP

@NotRealLife1 @AOC Oh, I've spoken about health of the mother. None of these examples though deal with healthy babies. We don't know for sure it hasn't happened...and, in fact, we know for sure it actually has: Gosnell.

Just to clarify: My goal is to unite. Most of you know that I've pivoted to using social media to spread positivity. At the same time, I won't sit silently as people present these terrifying and heartbreaking laws calling for the devaluing of life. I'll be speaking out.
It's not about being a Democrat or a Republican, but if one of the major parties plans to become the party of "do not resuscitate" and "it's not really a life until it's been out of the womb for an hour," said party is on horrific grounds and must do immediate soul searching.
"For the grace of God has appeared that offers salvation to all people. It teaches us to say 'No' to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age, while we wait for the blessed hope." - Titus 2:11-13
@RSAtlas Okay, fine. It's a terrible joke!
We can spend all day screaming, yelling &amp; waving signs. But that's not what's going to change hearts. Only God can do that. The best way to meet horrific views &amp; damaging perspectives that have taken root due to culture's lies is to present people with the gospel. Truth matters.
Remember when the man bun was the biggest thing we had to worry about in culture? Times have changed.
No matter how chaotic culture gets.		No matter how intense calling right wrong and wrong right gets.		No matter how troubling the laws become.		No matter how low culture's standards devolve.		We know who wins in the end. Keep the faith. Keep praying. Work hard to reach people.

Quit ginning yourself up on outrage. If you're a liberal or a conservative THINK about what you're reading. THINK about what you're watching. Stop looking to have your views validated in a world of click-bait tailored to prey on your inner rage. Be discerning.
Every time you encounter someone who enrages you...		Every time you've overtaken with shock/grieved by something a celeb, politician or influencer says...		Every time your worried about someone's impact on culture...		Stop. Pray. Pray for clarity for that person. Pray for truth.
Whether you are pro-life or pro-choice, abortion should break you. There's nothing to triumphantly shout about, nothing to celebrate. Loss of life should grieve us all, regardless of where we fall on the abortion spectrum. Any other reaction is tragic.

@etcpolitics See my feed. I've addressed all of this lol. Yes, we should pay taxes, but the Bible doesn't back a specific tax code...
We can proof text all day. But this actually is a great verse about giving and helping others. It doesn't say "Open your wallet. I'm taking 70 percent of your denariuses if there are more than 10 denariuses in your satchel." https://t.co/2fPr4BNARJ
@KWnFX I tend to favor the idea of a flat tax with no exemptions. Everyone just purely pays (outside of the poor, of course). I understand the issues with that too. I just think the system is insanely complex.
Well, many of these people have begged for a simpler system. https://t.co/6W3MAKMpEJ
Disagreeing isn't lying... https://t.co/Pht5qsvfks
@_Orwell @OHFScratch @BillHallowell I understand and I was pretty clear.
So, the tax argument I'm hearing is "we had terribly high marginal rates decades ago, so that justifies doing it again." Spoiler alert: this isn't a good argument. A bad policy then is just that: a bad policy.

Right. There's nothing wrong with paying taxes. I simply think there's something wrong with anyone paying 70% of any part of their salary. I don't believe you'll find a Bible verse that mandates that.		Lastly: try kindness. https://t.co/pcBkQMskST
@dychejs My taxes are heavy enough here in NY! I don't believe they are too low. But this is another drinks convo.
First, I'm well aware of the tax history. I still think it's wrong. Doesn't change my stance. Second, the history on that is a bit murkier than you'd imagine: https://t.co/nudmEYLV7B.

It's remarkable to me that anyone, anywhere thinks that it's appropriate to take 70% of any portion of any person's income. I don't care how wealthy we're talking. I don't care when that cut-off starts (even if it's the "$10 millionth dollar"). https://t.co/9jeK5BQ94N

@HT4Real I'd consider 1,000 people an emergency, especially if they're entering without being tracked. This isn't complicated. Now "national emergency" is a different story. But an emergency nonetheless.
If your mantra is "walls don't work" and "walls are immoral," you need to explain why locks and fences are used, no? I think it's pretty much a common sense issue. Trump might be over the top in framing and the wall might not be the real solution, but let's have honest debate.
@HT4Real Um, there‚Äôs a crisis when scores of people are able to enter a nation. I don‚Äôt agree with all of Trump‚Äôs rhetoric, but claims that this isn‚Äôt an issue are absolutely nuts.

@HT4Real @KWnFX In fairness, this is one big reason many cons don't like Trump.
@etcpolitics It's best to plan pregnancy. Agreed. It is also best not to praise abortion. And it's even better to teach self-restraint and accountability.
@jeffmason1 @colincampbell Oh my.
@KWnFX Yes! And at the same time, we need to all step up to fill voids. I have never been convinced that taxes are the best way to provide services, but sometimes they are the only way (when people don't step up). I think smaller and more efficient government should be the goal :)
@JustinJBasch What?
Truth. Sadly, presidents have a profound impact on public perception/ideology. We need to stop worshipping politics. Sadly, too many of us have made it into a religion. And it's not quite delivering much goodness. As always, David is spot on. https://t.co/mxfIyxxCJw

@foxbarlad @D_R_Berry Waffling? I'm pointing out your failed premise.
The "you aren't educated" crowd bothers me for this reason: assuming people of faith are uneducated ignores reality that much of our real "education" unfolds outside a classroom. Many believers are quite "educated" in worldly sense. But who cares. W/o truth, education is limited.
@foxbarlad @D_R_Berry It's interesting. You assume others aren't "educated." I'd argue that education happens outside of the classroom more than in it, so your premise is, again, silly. I have an MS in social research, credits from Harvard, etc. Education is great, but it's nothing without truth.

If you're really concerned with "brainwashing," you'd have plenty to say about media, Hollywood and universities. But people are selective when it comes to what form of "brainwashing" they're bothered by.		And that's pretty troubling, especially when you consider the power flow.
ADMISSION: I'm so in denial over the end of Christmas that I'm blasting holiday music and pretending it's all still impending.
@foxbarlad @JK_Riki "With no two alike." You sure about that? Again, these memes are inaccurate and meaningless.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Happy bday!
@foxbarlad @JK_Riki You're saying there are no Christians born and brought up in the Middle East who say what I'm saying? Weird.
Fake news. https://t.co/nEWY1DWUsX https://t.co/lUB3yODKWr
@foxbarlad Around the world? Certainly it's beyond millions...
@foxbarlad Never claimed millions in the Middle East, but conversions happen all the time. Your point is silly.
Are you saying there are no Middle Easterners who discover the gospel and are transformed by it? Also, there are Christians in the Middle East regardless... https://t.co/Vc8xsFueXQ
I believe the Bible. I also know you're oversimplifying all of this to fit a narrative, and that's fine. Totally your right. But the Bible has been pretty clear and solid in translations since the start, so this is a silly argument. Have a nice New Year! https://t.co/1i0zbKH21x
Yup. And, again, Christianity in its purest form isn't about ritual etc. So being "born" into it isn't really how it works. Sure, influence matters. But people all over the world with NO influence of Christianity discover Jesus and He transforms them. Why? We know why. https://t.co/0iEuOldgRX
Not shocking. I wrote a book about this. Feed people secularism on steroids through media, universities and entertainment and, shock, they embrace secularism. Thousands of years of history show that the Bible is true and that the gospel reaches hearts. I'm not worried. https://t.co/Kz2CACO3Gi
Also, "cultural Christianity" is on the decline. Which is fine. A more authentic faith is generally built/takes form when that happens. The gospel isn't going anywhere. https://t.co/QET9CWIyVs

Politics this, politics that. Quit letting politics drive you. Don't be blind to other people's ideas. Listen. Don't feel like you need to change or water down your ideals, but if you don't understand why someone believes something, how can you be so sure of what you embrace?

And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her." -Luke 2:26-38
And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren. For with God nothing shall be impossible.
And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
And the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest.
And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women. And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.
"And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.

@FatimaAtelier @mboorstein @ebruenig Huh? Why would that matter. What‚Äôs in the book is what is needed. I don‚Äôt get why that proof text would be used in this case.
@FatimaAtelier ‚ÄúJesus was free from the stain of original sin, but it was not necessary for His mother to be‚Äîor His grandmother‚Äîor His great-grandmother, etc. How far back would we have to go to insure Jesus‚Äô perfection, if it were necessary for Mary to be sinless?‚Äù https://t.co/YJbJBoH0KD
@FatimaAtelier @mboorstein @ebruenig Where is this in the Bible?
@FatimaAtelier @mboorstein @ebruenig I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs quite that simple...
@FatimaAtelier @mboorstein @ebruenig Some would argue that praying only to God is obeying Christ. Again, a point of debate.
@FatimaAtelier @mboorstein @ebruenig I meant the churches I have attended...and I don‚Äôt believe any one denomination holds the reigns on the origins of Christianity.
@FatimaAtelier @mboorstein @ebruenig The better question: where in scripture is evidence she is sinless? There is certainly evidence she saw Jesus as her savior as well.
@FatimaAtelier @mboorstein @ebruenig I think one is hard pressed to find Bible verses that back praying to anyone but God. But, again, an area of theological debate.
@FatimaAtelier @mboorstein @ebruenig I don't feel obligated to do that. She has always been spoken about in my churches. I've never felt she was ignored. I simply disagree with your take on what paying attention to her should look like.
@FatimaAtelier @mboorstein @ebruenig I mean, she was a holy woman who obviously was chosen by God, but she wasn't sinless. What do you mean by "refusal to accept?"
@FatimaAtelier @mboorstein @ebruenig I would personally disagree with praying to anyone outside of the Lord. So, again, that‚Äôs a legitimate area of discussion and debate.
@FatimaAtelier @mboorstein @ebruenig I think the debate should be fairly framed. It‚Äôs not as though Mary is ignored in the evangelical tradition.
@FatimaAtelier @mboorstein @ebruenig Well, there are legitimate theological grounds on which to debate. But that op-ed wasn‚Äôt addressing that. Everyone believes Mary was holy. The level to which people take that is where the debate emerges. I don‚Äôt believe the Bible calls for the type of sainthood you‚Äôve mentioned.
@FatimaAtelier @mboorstein @ebruenig Define ‚Äúhonor Mary?‚Äù I don‚Äôt pray to her nor do I worship her, but obviously have a deep respect for her. She‚Äôs a central figure in the Christian Faith.

@etcpolitics Well, they had said an average costs $1k-$1,500. They do 300K a year, no?

@D_R_Berry I agree! I do think questioning her response is appropriate. Attacking her is not. I worry for her that the crossover appeal can lead to some issues, but that's between her and God.

Politics has become a religion of sorts.		Many of those who claim to deeply love Jesus are putting tribe before gospel. 		It's their politics -- and their love or hate for a candidate -- that appears to trump their gospel alignment. 		Spoiler alert: this isn't a good thing.
Actions and words should align.		When actions and words don't align, there's a disconnect that threatens to damage your witness.		I know I've fallen before in this area. Have you? 		Let's be better.

This is a rant, I know. But I figured I would just vent. At the end of the day, everyone assuming politics will solve all of our problems is sadly, sadly mistaken. We keep distancing ourselves from the only real solution.
There‚Äôs no need for us to all agree, but there is a need for common decency. We keep letting things get more and more out of hand, then we act surprised when society moves further and further into a chaotic realm of confusion.
Too many of us are cold and disconnected. Too many of us seek the worst in one another and then only focus on the negative. Too many of us aim to hurt and take down others rather than understand what they believe and why they believe it.
Who are we? That‚Äôs a question I keep asking again and again as the headlines worsen.		Perhaps the better question is: who are we allowing ourselves to become? Culture is sick and rather than administer an antibiotic, we seem most interested in simply letting it get sicker.

The term "common-sense gun reform" is really problematic. It oversimplifies the problem. Both sides must sit down to discuss the real issues and real solutions -- openly. That includes weighing gun control and culture control practices. No one should be afraid of good discussion.
The whole "us vs. them" drama is getting old. Both sides, wake up.
We don't see the full picture the way God does. We tell others where they should be and how to get there. That's fine, but we have to remember that God is working on us all -- He sees the full picture; our view is limited.		So, before we totally write others off, remember that.

To @RealDeanCain: thanks for your role in ‚ÄúGosnell.‚Äù Truly important story ‚Äî thanks for helping tell it.
The Gosnell case was widely ignored by some because it forces us to look deeply at the reality of abortion and what it entails. It is easy to ignore that reality and boil everything down to buzzwords like ‚Äúfetus‚Äù and ‚Äúabort.‚Äù Reality requires honesty, though.
Gosnell‚Äôs actions leave us with a few questions: when is it no longer a woman‚Äôs right to choose? If killing a baby outside the womb at six months gestation is murder in the eyes of the law, why is it considered okay inside the womb at the same time? Who are we as a people?
