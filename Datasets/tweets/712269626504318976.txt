@NYPDCommAffairs @ManhattanDA safe heroin injection sites discriminate against those who snort and smoke heroin. But for drug dealers, who will swarm to these areas, all are welcome to buy.
@NYPDnews @NYPD67Pct we never see the person who possessed the illegal gun.

@CommissBratton @ManhattanInst @CityJournal @voxcustodes NYC has10% +murders in the last 30 days over 30% + rapes. Compare crimes against persons (murder, rape, assault, robbery) to property crimes (grand larceny auto, burglary, grand larceny) to get an accurate picture.  Technology (home security, automobile
@NYPDChiefofDept @NYPD52Pct @NYPDPBBronx @NYPDnews @NYPDONeill @NYPDDetectives @NYPDChiefPatrol @NYPDCommAffairs @NYPDDCPI @NYPDSpecialops @NYPDTransit @NYCMayorsOffice You failed to mention the individual who illegally possessed the gun that made it a crime.  A gun is an object.  Murders are up but not as much as rapes
@NYPDCommAffairs @McGruffatNCPC @Nasdaq @Adweek FYI Murders and Rapes are up dramatically over the past month.  Give McGruff a bone and do police work.
@RepKathleenRice Maybe ask colleagues and media to stop using terms like drunk, black out alcoholic, and sloppy drunk.  So much for "stop stigma."  Unless it's for political purposes.
@RichLowry "Stepped over the line," only nutty liberal could use that phrase to describe leaving a human being to drown while you go for a power nap.
@JonathanTurley There are bacteria more popular than her.
@DLoesch Justice Hugo Black was a member of the Klan. Liberals loved him on the bench.  He never drank in college.
@SenSchumer Justice Hugo Black was Member of the Klan. But don't think he drank beer in college.
@JulietHuddyTV I wonder if Ted Kennedy ever blacked out?
@katcreag4NY Homicides and rapes continue to increase

@NYPDChiefofDept @800273TALK @TalkToMe More than 60% increase in homicides over last month.  Show more rookie pictures of you.  It might distract us from  Murder and rapes #s  They are  off the hook. Maybe a new dance video?  "Off the hook, so please don't look?"

@ChrisCuomo Is your brother going to name the George Washington Bridge after your mom?
@JAM_ASAM What about safe injection sites?  Will women who are pregnant be permitted to inject heroin?
@brithume I will side with the Generals.
@nypost DiBlasio will have him as next Grand Marshal.
@NYGovCuomo Will you name George Washington Bridge after mom?
@NYPDChiefofDept I applaud the effort of the men and women. But why does NYPD Leadership ignore dramatic increase in Rape and Misdemeanor sex crimes. It seems cowardly and deceptive.  You are better than that.  Especially since you never locked up Weinstein on a slam dunk collar.
@NYPDnews One of those few that Chief is talking about
@NYPDChiefofDept @NYPD77Pct more than 3 reported Rap victims every 24 hours in NYC... "very few" seems disingenuous

@SenGillibrand Next time you are in NYC please visit the Police Memorial.  Lots of names of men ( all colors)  who were killed fighting that war.
@Lulu_McFu @chuckwoolery @BreitbartNews I always loved him.  Mark,Donald and Rudy have one thing in common. When the country they claim to love needed them to fight, they backed down.  MCCain, like his father and his grandfather serve his country.  He gave much more that those theee combined.

@JulieBanderas NYC crime statistics show that 3 rapes are reported each day
@julieroginsky Please take time (if you dont already) to give compassions to the homeless who sleep on our streets and eating from our trash. I'm not suggestions we cant do both, I just know there are plenty right in front of us that we just don't see.
@CBSNewYork Maybe Gov Cuomo can sue Washington for this too.  However, I don't think it will get the trains running
@RobertGBeckel @Lulu_McFu see there they go
@JulieBanderas I strongly suggest taking a walk around NYC ( including the subways ) and talk to the people living on the street. They are not provided meals except if you count sifting through garbage dumpsters.  We have a crisis right in front of us and yet we look elsewhere ...
@LauraAJarrett He was ripped away.

@NYPDnews @NYCMayor @NYPDONeill Alcohol policy = $25 Civil fine. Marijuana = appear at court, if you fail to appear you have a warrant, next time stopped you get arrested. Who is running this place?
@PeiSzeCheng4NY @BRubinCNBC You are right it's not legal to board and then receive transportation without paying the appropriate fare.
@WashTimes Thanks Obama

@NYCMayor When the "Raise the Age" initiate is fully implemented would 16/17 year old be liable to a ticket?
@NYPDChiefPatrol ''Raise the Age" will prohibit 16/17 year olds from receiving criminal summonses.  Whats the strategy?

@BillHemmer I just assumed parents were paying.
@JulieBanderas Sounds silly but I'm not sure what the definition of child is anymore. Healthcare defined up to 26, right to vote is 18, some states you can marry at 17.
@RepJerryNadler @SecNielsen J NAD did you get a chance to visit any of the 17 victims of the shooting from Trenton while you were in Jersey. I know they are not in your District but they are from your country.
@MikeLupica @SRuhle @MSNBC Please visit Arlington and ask for forgiveness.
@CBSNewYork @DanaTylerTV 3x rapes per day, homeless everywhere, decriminalize marijuana, safe heroin injection sites, no changes in homicides.

@NYPDTimesSquare @NYPDBees @NYPDnews @NYPDSpecialops I see lots of homeless and people high on narcotics. And the Sponge Bob character smells like Johnny Walker.
@AielloTV I will be there Saturday
@Jill_Jorgensen NYPD has had a major decrease in narcotic/ marijuana arrests under this administration. The lose an effective enforcement tool. Smell of marijuana inside a car allows a search of vehicle.
@NYPDnews @nypost Sounds like fake news.
@AprilDRyan Did see the story about the 17 American citizens shot in Newark. So sad.
@NBCNews This woman just called IG Horowitz Director Comey. He was sitting about 15 feet from her.
@Alyssa_Milano No mention of 17 shot in NJ?
@NewDay The "Hitler" or "Nazi" response is always a game changer for me.  Want to criticize the presendient or their policy, sure that's fair game. Use good reason and logic to show why the policy troubles you. But once you pull out the "H" or "N" word, I decide to move on.
@Noahsyndergaard just when I was about to throw my slipper at the television, Mr. Nimmo saved the day. I still was angry at his previous at bat and then ... redemption. Not for him, but for me. These guys are family, dysfunctional and all. We are in this together ...

@jonathan4ny @NBCNewYork You crash a plan because you don't want to follow the flight plan not because you hate the passengers. "what difference does it make?"	If only Hiliary followed the flight plan and not have separate email she would be #45
@Surgeon_General @Lulu_McFu
@NYPDChiefPatrol @NYPDChiefofDept @NYPDDetectives Basically the same amount of people shot and same number of homicides.  35% increase in rapes.  Please stay safe and be transparent.
@CommissBratton @USArmy I am sorry.  I never knew your served.  I was aware of Commissioner Kelly's record. Thank You
@FoxNews When a man with a gun meets up with a man with pepper spray. They man with the gun wins 100% of the time.
@ABC @aurorany93
@NYPDnews More that 3 rapes per day.
@katcreag4NY @NBCNewYork Stage a homicide by making it look like arson, sex crime (Robert Chambers case), or a suicide.  Also any time you report on a stabbing (without robbery) think the perpetrator knowns the victim.  It's a crime of passion.
@metsblog The missing piece. Can he play RF?

@Lulu_McFu @Acosta Being a journalist requires responsibility, courtesy and professionalism. Two characteristics you appear to lack.

@JohnKingCNN  your story about your friend/ coworker was touching and I am very sorry. I notice the word "suicide" wasn't mentioned once by "journalist.". The  stigma soaked to suicide/mental illness will not subside by  ignoring. It is counterproductive @cnnbrk
@SenGillibrand Paid by whom?
@CNNPR Sadly, instead of opening a much need d discussion on suicide and mental health. CNN will sweep this under the rug of stigma and move on. Had this been a comedian, Fashion designer it would be lead story every 30 minutes.
@jaketapper First, my deepest condolences to Mr. Bourdain's family / friends. A suicide death, too often, is often associated with stigma - selfishness, weakness, madness. This is an oppirtunity for CNN to begin a conversation about suicide. Sadly, I suspect, they will not -instead move on.
@Lulu_McFu @realDenzelWash @Fuctupmind @StephenAtHome Real?
@NYPDONeill 1400 overdose death (illegal drugs) while dramatic reduction of narcotic enforcement. Homicide and rape increase. Police morale decreases due to poor leadership. Decriminalize pot/safe injection site/homelessness
@RepHastingsFL Keep your hands off women

@KatTheHammer1 @aurorany93
@thehill In NYC three women are raped each day, 260 people have been shot and close to 100 murdered - and it is celebrated as a safe big city.
@ABC It's even easier than that. Don't watch ABC
@dbongino I hope you are being sarcastic. Less than a year ago you referred to the Logan Act as jaywalking - I disagreed with you then. But you can't have it both ways. This is what troubles me
@JulietHuddyTV The British were responsible for the death and relocation of millions of Irish during the Great Famine. Easy for some to turn a blind eye
@AprilDRyan Sadly didn't mention the millions or Irish who were staved to death  or forced to migrate during the Great Famine. Easy for some to turn a blind eye to that
@ChrisCuomo Chris you ( I'm guessing but could be wrong) in a city where close to 100 people have keen killed this year, 260 or so shot, three women are raped each day.  Would love to see the outrage but suspect it won't get much ratings so why care

@NYPDnews @NYPDDetectives @MylesMill @NY1 This seems counterproductive to "safe heroin injection sites?" Users need to buy heroin from dealers to inject it at supervised locations. Reducing the supply will only increase the price and place unnecessary financial burden on those looking to purchase/possess/inject lawfully

@BaphometsMinion @SBANYPD I think their policy prohibits contact with previously convicted persons. As a captain, it would be impossible to not know that. Also, smoking marijuana is still illegal.
@Lulu_McFu @Scaramucci Excellent point. I love MCCain and find it hypocritical than many who are honoring his service today were questioning his mental health in 2000 and 08
@marthamaccallum There is no bigger supporter than me of Sen MCCain. He is a true American hero. I wish those who are now coming to his defense did so in 2000 and in 2008. What that woman said was "deplorable" and feeds the narrative of the left.

@CJ_freethinkr Most lawful gun owners choose to use them lawfully same is true with those prescribed opioids lawfully. A very small number of lawful gun owner commit crimes with firearms, a small number (8-10%) over entire population become addicted to drugs (alcohol included).
@ShatterproofHQ @TSchillerMD1 NYC will soon make a decision on whether to permit "safe injection sites" within city limits. I would be very interested in any comments in opposition or in favor. Thank You

@LilyMarin8 @YouTube I think it's a good idea to impound an uninsured vehicle on the public roads.
@LilyMarin8 @YouTube Interesting how you and I view this video completely different. Not sure why she flashed a badge or business card or why she preferred to be called commissioner. The driver had information regarding impounding uninsured vehicle
@kittybravofan Regardless of her political affiliation I think her behavior was wrong. She could have easily asked the driver what happened. She may have been embarrassed that her flashing a badge pulled no weight nor should it had. Uninsured cars should not be on the road
@CBSNewYork It's amazing to me how she can't look at that and admit she was wrong, apologize and we can all move on.
@AnthonyDiComo Defense looked tired
@GloriaGoogleInc @itsgabrielleu @OOOhTwit @HillaryClinton She has a right to ask a question but the cops have no obligation to answer. I hate all the money I spend on car insurance but I pay it because it's the law.

@shanekeester "No, no, no," is not a complete sentence. (subject + predicate + complete thought/idea)

@JLaytonTV @CBSNewYork I believe the lawful term was called sodomy but today is referred to as Criminal Sex Act. A 14-year-old can never have sexual "contact."
@CBSNews Auto insurance in NJ is extremely expensive, so why pay it? MIT students  really are intelligent.  (2 complete sentences!)
@NYPDTransit @NYCTSubway when you get a free moment can you board a train and stop a pitbull from eating a womans arm off
@thehill bring mace
@Sergeant_Jones those officers did a remarkable job
@realtruth60 @abluecanary I was unaware that students from MIT / Yale were exempt from having auto insurance
@nwwong I'm guessing probably all black students at MIT and Yale operate motor vehicles that are properly insured and properly registered
@MaryPatRyan unlike her three houses, the vehicle was uninsured. her daughter was a passenger in an uninsured/unregistered vehicle (she didn't seem concerned about) with unlawfully tinted windows.
@CBSNewYork According to the law A 14 year old adolescent  is incapable of  having sex with an adult.  Years ago the crime was called sodomy but had been changed to criminal sex act.
@MattFriedmanNJ That is a joke.
@petittonton @StephenAtHome your sister's friend is deplorable.
@STATter911 @katesdragon1 Wonder why she mentioned her 3 homes, Ivey league education, her status as a lawyer and commissioner ? Her actions were deplorable

@JonahNRO Please, whatever you do don't use plastic shopping bags. Our Gov just outlawed them
@NYGovCuomo We had free college in the 1970s but the the state almost went bankrupt. The president told us to drop dead. But then, thank God, we elected Ed Kock despite gay slurs by his opponent.

@realDonaldTrump @aurorany93
@CBSNewYork @NYPDnews we haven't seen this gun arrest. Please post it.  It's the one with defaced serial number.
@CBSNewYork @DLoesch @dbongino  a little bit ironic, don't you think. Another example of why we need more gun laws. Both her parents are judges and she works for Mayor
@NYPDFIRSTDEP Can you please post photos of defaced firearm removed from Mayor's Aid and her friends with prior arrests. It is perfect illustration of why need more gun laws.
@NYPDnews @NYPDPSA3 Any photos of defaced firearm recovered from vehicle with the Mayors Aid on Criminal Justice?
De Blasio aide busted with gun in car @DLoesch @NRATV @dbongino  https://t.co/BGoyZiseRv

@edhenry What with the jacket? Happy St Pat's Day or the Masters?
@1EdTooTallJones Maintain cover.  Look up while loading and easy trigger pull.
@Matt_Maisel @WJACTV How does reporters balance the trauma they may cause the victim against the importance of the story. It is an honest question.
#Paterno wondering if HBO will do a program of Weinstein, Spacey, or others. When someone molest a child, sexually assaults a woman ... u stop it, call cops, have them locked up
@CBSNewYork @DaveCarlinTV @aurorany93

@ASAMorg @NIDAnews @AmerMedicalAssn @FacingAddiction @NIAAAnews @AORecovery @AMSANational @NAATPMarv @FACESandVOICES @NACoA_USA @samhsagov There is an assumption that all people authorized addiction want treatment. It would be fantastic if that was true but this statistic is misleading.

@chicagotribune @ABC7NY see they didn't say unarmed
@EricLiptonNYT That was an exit interview
@nypost They were in uniform but failed to identify themselves.  Tomorrow I am going to ask the person in the postal uniform with packages and mailbexiting a USPS truck ... who are you?
@CeFaanKim @ABC7NY "Unarmed" might lead one to believe that his hands were empty ... poor description of event

@dcexaminer thats because...they went away. Why not focus on her future and spend time with family and not worry about the past. She is the Scott Norwood of politics, so what. Life is short enough - Clancy Boys sang "the longer we live, the sooner we bloody well die"

@NMalliotakis @nypmetro @NYPD75Pct  the building is still there on Liberty Avenue.
@NMalliotakis @NYPDONeill this was a slaughter... but I guess Parole Board thinks different.
@NMalliotakis @rosannascotto I'm sure you remember this case.  Parole board didn't
@NMalliotakis @DLoesch this was a blood bath where children were slaughtered.  NYC said they would never forget.  Well, looks like they forgot
@NMalliotakis @bernieandsid
@NMalliotakis @NYPDnews I guess "never forget" means ...
@NMalliotakis @nypmetro @AielloTV those who remember this story are probably scratching their head... but most people don't care
@NMalliotakis @nypmetro @SBANYPD
@NMalliotakis @nypmetro Sadly, "never forget" is becoming more and more meaning less.
@NMalliotakis @nypmetro @JulieBanderas the outrage only last so long.
@JulieBanderas @davidhogg111 I would hope that anytime innocent people Are slaughtered there would be outrage, shock and horror ... sadly it's not
@GainerTV Interesting why the woman wasn't charged with an attempt assault instead of the lesser charge reckless. In charging reckless, the police are saying the woman did not intent to push the victim.

@CBS I'm glad violence is not glorified in this film
@DLoesch in last 12 hours NYPD shot two perps, (libs count this as gun violence). One lunged with a knife, another displayed a gun, the first in Manhattan the last in Staten Island. Neither suspect identified as NRA member or lawful gun owner ... no march has been planned
@NYPDnews How did this person ever pass a background check.  Glad cops are safe
@ABC7NY what time is protest march?
@NYPDChiefofDept @NYPDChiefPatrol @NYPD120Pct Was suspect an NRA Member?
@FoxNews Republicans will take a beat down in 2018 House ... one simple reason 1 trillion dollars ... DT handed them the House
@NYPDnews @NYPDONeill @nytimes I think the guy your officers just shot (justified) was on his second, or more chance...
@NYPDnews @NYPD67Pct We need more gun laws !!!
@NYPDnews NRA Members?
@nytimes What % of gun violence is committed by lawful gun owners? Each % of gun violence is committed by NRA Members? Although, the answer to the second question is difficult for LEO to answer, the first is pretty simple, since LEO issue permits/licenses...

@lizdahlem @WholeFoods @NYPDnews What do u call a person with a knife who charges towards a person with a gun ... an ambulance
@NYPDChiefofDept @NYPDPBMN @NYPD28Pct Glad cops are ok.
@thehill I think that is the current law.
@CBSNews What do you call a person with a knife who lunges at a person with a gun? An ambulance
@ChrisGrollnek Late 1980s suicide bomber in NYC subway at 125/Lexington avenue and also plan to bomb city subways at Atlantic avenue was foiled 1998 maybe 1999. Book : Jihad in Brooklyn
@TheBeatWithAri @MSNBC Where those students  who at the time is the shooting used Kevlar mats to save the lives of others? I didn't see their speech.
@NYPDnews What do you call Someone with a knife who charges at someone with a gun?  Answer.  An ambulance
