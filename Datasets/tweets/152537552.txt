@noyb100 @RedBedlam_ No, any idea that handcuffs success is flawed.
@systemError2011 @RedBedlam_ You want it, go get it. Even with all our troubles, we still have that.
@systemError2011 @RedBedlam_ ...8.7 million people with at least a million dollars, through assets or cash, say otherwise.

@623Sis They sure as hell aren't looking for work, like, you know, NORMAL HUMANS
@RedBedlam_ #occupywallstreet They need to learn economics before trying to kill capitalism. I refuse to let that go down.
@RedBedlam_ Yes, I can agree. Problem is that the ones that want to kill capitalism got my attention, and it's not going to be pretty.
@systemError2011 To let you know, I am a Tim Tebow fan. Regardless of what anyone thinks of his religion, he's genuine, and gives so much.
@systemError2011 I just don't want people to think that wealth is nothing but a parasite, especially when you can do good with it.
@systemError2011 I was PROUD to see Madoff get caught, and Stanford, and any others that stole from people.
@systemError2011 Ok, now that you and I aren't trading barbs, that's all I'm trying to bring up here.
@RedBedlam_ Exactly. Anyone that tries to take my capitalist mindset is going to get swung on...HARD!
@systemError2011 Nice play on words. Eh, I can take or leave Rush. My guy is actually Jon Stewart. He pounds on both sides.
@systemError2011 ...the poor. Wealthy people that do it honestly? He's a criminal. Guess what. Majority of wealthy people do it honestly.

@systemError2011 Depends. Did he steal from criminals or the rich? They aren't hand in hand, no matter what you think.
@RedBedlam_ I agree, and that's why I get aggravated with all this. I want to destroy criminals, not the rich. Big difference.
The man to bring our country back to its roots is Herman Cain!
@proudamericans Herman Cain is that man.
@RedBedlam_ I'll respect if they respect me. I'm tired of the bullying the #occupywallstreet people are doing. Time someone swung back.
@systemError2011 ...think it's a disease to want to be successful. Oh, and by the way, the wealthy give more to charity, by far, than poor.
@systemError2011 No. Jackoffs in corporations too, just like there are jackoffs in the poor circles. Just saying that you liberal pansies...
@NatalieDuvalNY Why in the HELL would you quote that fat hypocrite? Haha
#OccupyWallStreet Conservative heroes = Herman Cain. Liberal heroes = Janeane Garafalo. That's why the liberals fail every time.
@RedBedlam_ It's like they think being independently wealthy and successful is a disease, and you need to be a failure in life.
@RedBedlam_ Red, let me be honest. I'm trying to inform most of these goofs that the majority of wealthy people are not crooks.
@systemError2011 Michael Moore. Try SUCCEEDING for yourself for once!
@systemError2011 Yeah yeah, and keep following the idea that you have no chance to make it in this country. Keep listening to that pansy lib
@Conclusionist Oh, and don't forget making men look like incompetent fools.
@RedBedlam_ Wealthy people do know how money works. They know how to get tax breaks. Don't bitch at them for what they know, and you don't.

@jjauthor @IAMPCBob Amazing how many people fall for that line without realizing how many liberals would screw up if you GAVE them money.
@jjauthor @IAMPCBob It's an attack on the successful, and it must stop.
@jjauthor @IAMPCBob Libs prefer excuses and whining about the rich.
@jjauthor @IAMPCBob Pansy liberals want to be dependent. It keeps them from the hard work and determination it takes to succeed.
@jjauthor I always say it this way...Don't climb the ladder...BE THE LADDER!
@American1st I always say liberal is a four letter word.
@IAMPCBob Wow, between Perry and Cain, we might have a chance for an actual MAN in the White House again.
@GarrettQuinn You mean we'd have an actual MAN running the country again? Very novel concept!
@IAMPCBob @theRealExTex By the way, I am not PC either. I'd never win any kind of election, haha.
@theRealExTex And tell me something. Is it wrong to say that Americans need to be like Tim Tebow? Bust their ass workers with no excuses?
@peytonjames His plan is to tell us the other plans he had in the first place...if he remembers them.
@theRealExTex I say you and I team up to squash some liberal pansies? What do you say?
@theRealExTex What in the hell is a beauty like you doing in such an ugly state?
@theRealExTex And let's squash those worthless pansy liberals, shall we?
@theRealExTex One day I want to move to Texas. Just love the state. Big dreams, big opportunities.
@CapitalistRock Obama's plan includes figuring out how many other plans he had before.
@capflowwatch TSA = Tickle Someone's Ass
@theRealExTex A Tough Texas girl. Love it. Keep up the fight!
@ChavezChavis Obama should like that news. His policies do nothing but lay people off.
@deadvoter @slingbrush The Hills Have Bacon sounds like something Barney Frank had a dream about last night.
@tamale102280 Are you really that surprised. A lot of union members look like idiots and sheeple.
@tamale102280 Union leaders are more criminal than the corporations they rail against.
@capflowwatch Only Obama would walk on water and complain his feet got wet.
@tamale102280 Just hide Dick Trumka's food cart. He'll leave in a huff.
@PolarCoug And Michelle's on the bus, doing a conference call to fast food restaurants about healthy eating while plowing into a big mac.
@ECDII Country's full of whiny, wimpy liberals...but the good thing is that there are more conservatives.
@PolarCoug Those unicorn farts were a sham. They only get 9 mpg.
@THEHermanCain Never quit in your fight. We as Americans are going to fight to get our country back, hell or high water!
@PolarCoug Barney Frank could plump cooled off in a freezer.
@ECDII You are right, but it's time for those same people to quit wanting to be handed everything, and start having an eye of the tiger.
@pinkelephantpun Sure, but at 17-16, it's a bit dangerous. There's a RINO in there somewhere. I'd like one more to kick Moore in the nuts.
@TeaPartyNJ Soon enough, he'll forgo the midwest tour and say "let's find that friendly state of Vermont and go there"
@GregWHoward @pir8gold I'm torn on if she has a brain CELL
@pinkelephantpun All the Repubs need is 1 more really. It feels so good to see Michael Moore defeated time and time again.
@ECDII @GregWHoward The more we as people start doing and stop bitching, the less government we need, and the more this country comes back.
@JanSimpson Nahhh, but I agree more Herman Cain than Rick Perry. I like Perry, but there's a couple things I disagree with.
@JohnIsner Del Rio's an awesome heel champ. I hope he keeps it for a bit.
@ECDII @GregWHoward Right now? No. Here's the thing though. I make my successes, and make my way. I'm not going to quit on this country.
@GregWHoward He's a smart guy, no doubt. Still, his whole existence depends on the economy sucking. We need to get the economy back.
@JanSimpson I like Herman Cain, but I don't think he has a chance now. I like Rick Perry also, even though I don't agree with all he says.
@commonpatriot I damned well hope so.
@GregWHoward Roubini wouldn't have a job if the economy recovered.
@GregWHoward Ok, I say it again...Krugman's an idiot
@peytonjames Paul Krugman's an idiot.
@politeracy That's what Obama's expectation for his fellow poor people are. The old Michael Moore idea that it's a 1 in a million chance..
@JanSimpson @IAmJulesTyles Hey Jules, aren't liberals supposed to be smarter than conservatives? How do you explain your bad language?
@informedblackmn Eh, just call him OBlahBlah. It rhymes.
@TPO_Hisself Naw, mischief's too strong of a word. New term is "Just had a really bad day"
@JanSimpson Hey you! Long time no see! Who is your GOP pick?
@JessicaNorthey Better with you on here.
@PolarCoug All honesty though, Cain is my pick. Been in the private sector far longer than anyone. And yes, anything beats numnuts.
@PolarCoug Guy raises an assload of money though. He'll be a threat. I kinda like the guy, even if I don't agree with all his views.
@davidwebbshow Or ordering at McDonalds while hitting on Monica the cashier...while smoking a cigar. Whatever comes first.
@PolarCoug What do you think of Rick Perry?
@PolarCoug Like Ron Paul's chances for president?
@PolarCoug @proudamericans What do you call Barack Obama with a good economic policy? A first time for everything.
@stephenkruiser Not exactly headline news there. They were born that way.
@TexasRV And the other 46% are idiots.
@TexSean #ObamaBusNames Michael Moore's moving refrigerator.
@conservagirl Don't forget, the progressives are the tolerant party.
@CenturyFinance They know Perry will beat their golden child, and beat him like a drum.
What do you call a liberal with sound economic ideas? A first time for everything.
@MMFlint It's going to be 18-15, AT LEAST, on August 16th. You liberals are losers and you might as well face the facts.
@FatFemPinUp I'd say that about you piece of shit liberals, but you never learn anyway.
@FatFemPinUp See, I know I'm going to be successful. You? You would rather listen to fat piece of shit Michael Moore and cry about things.
@FatFemPinUp A bunch of excuse making, crybaby, self absorbed wimps!
@FatFemPinUp And how about QUIT THINKING POOR! You panty waisted liberals think "oh woe is me, I'm poor" instead of GETTING OUT OF IT!
@FatFemPinUp It was the southern Dems who were for the KKK, you uninformed liberal. I feel sorry for you.
@FatFemPinUp Sack of shit panty waist asshole liberals. Destroy everything they touch.
@FatFemPinUp Your piece of shit liberal group sure as shit doesn't care about people. Liberal is a four letter word for a good reason.
@FatFemPinUp Give me a break. Oblahblah had a near supermajority and still got nothing done. He's a wimp of a president and needs to go.
@twittle_dee 31 million, or the equivalent of Dick Trumka's grocery bill.
@twittle_dee Unions waste their dollars every day of their lives. They are just as bad as government with their spending habits.
@GPSSR I wish. Ed Schultz is the boil on America's ass.
@anthonylaw Remember what Herman Cain said about how liberals follow the SIN tactics.
@nowordsforme I refuse to be scared off by all this. I just keep fighting.
@capflowwatch Obama looks at the stock market and goes "My debt plan is working...now I just need to know what it is myself."
@JasonBWhitman Arianna Huffington deserves this mightily.
@cmdorsey Obama looking at the stock market right now going "My debt plan is working! Now I wish I knew what it was!"
@tnfiredup Someone with guts who never backed down?
@tnfiredup I live in Atlanta now. By the way, wouldn't it be great to have a REAL man in the White House...like say, Reagan?
@CommMarine You mean PMSNBC isn't legit? I'M SHOCKED...SHOCKED I SAY!
@New_federalists Isn't "liberal" latin for perpetual loser?
@tnfiredup Where in Tennessee do you live? I went to Lee University in Tennessee.
@anthonylaw No, when they lose, they try recounts and accuse the other side of dirty tricks.
@Jarjarbug George W's laughing right now, knowing that by the end of all this, the American people will be blasting all over Obama now, haha
@SenRandPaul He has one plan...tax the rich. The Repubs are stopping this for sanity's sake.
@DanIsett Was 315.
@Jarjarbug 315 points down in 8 minutes on the stock market. Any doubt Oblahblah goes down as the worst president in history?
@Jarjarbug Van Jones. Sounds like a reject singer from the Woodstock era.
@ChavezChavis Hey, you are a liberal, so that proves my point.
@nowordsforme No surprise. The markets will see saw like this because of good deals, then go back to normal again.
@PolarCoug It's always a great day when a liberal loses. Then again, it's also pretty normal too.
@ChavezChavis And it's worthless libs like you who make it a race issue. He's an idiot no matter the color.
@ChavezChavis And liberal opinions suck something fierce. Always will.
@tnfiredup Thanks for the follow? By the way, aren't you too young to be a Reaganite? ;)
@BrianINC @Ssmfarley777 @goqivana @aussietorres @FoxieNews @River_City @travelingseas @RayLarsen @buttsplc05 Thank you.
@ChavezChavis Why would I want to deal with the guy who helped lower our credit rating? His policies are garbage like all liberal policies.
@BrianINC Don't forget me!
@ChavezChavis Hey, when you voted for OBlahBlah, you already voted for the destruction of our economy. Don't blame us.
@ChavezChavis Ahhh, i knew you had to be somewhere. Just wanted to say HAHAHHAHAH, loser liberals fail again!
@maggie82 And socialism makes porta potties. Same size, same shape, all corners even, and nowhere to move.
@KerryPicket Great column Kerry. Remember that there is one more recall election next week for the two Dems, so now they have the pressure.
@slone You can't say thugs when it comes to Dems. It's wimps, whiners, liberals, pansies, and hand out kings. Those are better terms.
@imsure And if the Repubs can at least take ONE Dem seat, then the Dems' fight will be castrated. Their recall Walker garbage is history.
@JessicaNorthey @korrytaylor @Bren_Keller Real men don't need coffee to wake up in the morning, haha.
@NatalieDuvalNY Haw haw haw! Nothing like when the Dems tried to recount a whole district's votes because they were losing, right?
@Lostmybeer Isn't it so great to see the Regressives lose time and time again...like last night for instance?
@imsure Doesn't it feel so good to say that?
@HulkHogan4Real Just wanted to say that Impact is incredible Tonight. Tons of wrestling. Keep that up! Wrestling is where it's at!
@slone Luck plays a big part, but the rich know how to capitalize on luck.
@HulkHogan4Real How surprised were you about Edge's retirement?
@EternalRiteWing He's egotistical and would be a terrible president.
@iheartresults Got it
@EternalRiteWing Guhhhh, I don't want Trump anywhere near the White House.
@conservagirl Sounds like you are speaking about Pelosi too.
@bmangh I don't watch FOX, you liberal pansy. Can't stand them. I just hate PMSNBC more. I can see they brainwash you.
@thorninaz I've been saying that for years.
@Lostmybeer They spend a lot of bucks too, and make none.
@bmangh Sorry, I'm not liberal, so stupid is out of the question. Quit being a pansy liberal and wake up!
I see Donald Trump is Pro-Life now. He definitely knows the political game.
Yup, reality hits hard. Obama's 2010 budget: deficit soars amid job spending | Reuters http://t.co/ueRFXJB via @reuters
@bmangh Oh go find a union person to hug and STFU!
@bmangh Liberals always believe they are bullied, and don't know how to fight back. They deserve to lose.
@JimPethokoukis It's just a matter of time till he's voted out of office. He doesn't have his base anymore, and we don't like him.....
@tinastullracing Good for you to wake up that early!
John Boehner closes the deal to avoid government shutdown - John Bresnahan and Jake Sherman - P.. http://politi.co/etsusN
@exposeliberals He did what he could. At least the liberals are pissed off about the bill.
@exposeliberals Hey man, I have to say this. Boehner, GOP or not, is still a politician. If the government shuts down, he gets blamed.
@bmangh Yeah, those would be the gimme gimme government jobs. Obama appeals to the people that have no fire to be successful.
I'm back!!!! AND BETTER THAN EVER! I'M HERE....TO PISS OFF LIBERALS!!!!!
@AHusseinChavis I should know. You are the biggest racist I've ever spoken to on here.
@bmangh You are a worthless liberal. You guys don't deserve happiness, or your way.
@AHusseinChavis Racist? You are a dumb piece of garbage liberal. You realize the tea party elected the most black members of any party?
@bmangh Your disappearence last night shows that you aren't ready for the bloodbath. Hope you sleep with a nightlight.
@AHusseinChavis Oh please shut up. The southern democrats used to finance the KKK. You are just O-Bots for a party that strengthened them.
@AHusseinChavis You are losers, proud to be losers, and always will be losers. Enjoy your night of wishing you were successful and important
@AHusseinChavis I know plenty about liberals, and even if I didn't, your anger, venom, and jealousy shows me all I need to know.
@MrsDaschofsky Obama would tax the slurpee.
@AHusseinChavis Like Obama did with you? You are the biggest O-Bot out there.
@AHusseinChavis That's what you liberals do. You make excuses, then blame it on the rich. You are worthless pansies.
@AHusseinChavis See, I'm not you though. You'd show up at the unemployment office at 11 AM, after sleeping in and Springer's show.
@bmangh Yeah, like Obama didn't campaign 19 times for a certain Ohio candidate, and the guy got beat anyway.
@AHusseinChavis Oh yeah, and liberals are such honest people. Get off your high horse, you pantywaists! Go ban more dodgeball or something.
@AHusseinChavis You panty waisted liberals have jealousy issues and you know it.
@AHusseinChavis Hey, liberals are always useless, whether they are black or white. No racism involved in the stupidity of a liberal.
@AHusseinChavis No, I feel great voting for Republicans. Panty waisted liberal democrats like to put a cap and tax on successful people.
@bmangh Ahhh, you are angry. You libs deserve it, as much distrust as your party has caused with this country.
@bmangh The GOP Tsunami that caused the Democratic bloodbath last night.
@bmangh Wow, a whole 24 hours and you expect change. I understand, the liberals couldn't do anything in two years.
@bmangh Ahhhh, you came back! Good to see you again. I see you were running from the utter bloodbath last night. Don't worry, most libs were

@MelissaTweets I Am A Real American by Rick Derringer
@mikepfs Obama's lost his base a LONG time ago. A little tough to bring "change" when the libs think you aren't liberal enough.
@bmangh No more backwards than the libs have brought it.
@bmangh Piece of shit, panty waist, kum by ya, wimpy liberals!
@bmangh Your pansies gave us no jobs, and very little growth. At least with Repubs, we'll have less government to interfere with everything.
@bmangh You panty waisted liberals haven't done a damned thing in two years. We might actually get something done.
@markross67 Mark, it's up to US to keep from being screwed. We're screwed the minute any of us relies on politicians to run our lives.
Check this video out -- Rick Derringer - I am a Real American http://t.co/YmHtP0v via @youtube

@BendOverDems Is there any irony to mentioning Barney Frank and having the name of Bend Over? Hmmmmm!
@GregWHoward Any wonder I always say liberal is a four letter word?

@markross67 Basically a RINO, but that's all you get in liberal states.
@markross67 Mark, none of us can agree with Scott Brown, but he's in a liberal state, and he's a politician that wants to keep his job.

@zuzupetals09 Jokes aside, Lindsay's problems are with scrips, not alcohol or drugs. One of the biggest reasons I hate big pharma.
@zuzupetals09 You forget that Progressives are incapable of living without help. It's like Lindsay Lohan going cold turkey off drugs.
@lizarddawg This country already has. Look at the amount of fight the citizens of this country show in favor of Capitalism.
@jd3240 Ignorant leftists at that.
@TheGenuineDavid And the liberal contingent thinks he's nowhere NEAR left enough, and are criticizing him too.
@TheGenuineDavid What do you think Obama's ineptness is doing?! We'd be in a hell of a lot more trouble if it weren't for that.
@hipEchik First off, to get true academia back, we need to reward teachers that have innovative educational ideas, and not the status quo.
@TheGenuineDavid At this point, I'd even take Carter over Obama. At least Carter shows love for this country.
@hipEchik Biggest difference between Academia and Hollywood is that Hollywood actually has conservatives that aren't IN the closet.
@blackbeltncrazy You said you played Risk ;-)
@STXherry Finally? The liberal press has, for the most part, destroyed Obama. They think he's not left ENOUGH! Funny, I know.

@TheGenuineDavid At this point, Kevin Kline's version of "Dave", when he played the president, would be better than Obama.
@zuzupetals09 Hey, just call him a Harry Reid supporter. That's a bigger insult than anything out there right now, other than a Pelosi one.

@Peschko Oh GIVE IT UP! The poor people are going to get hosed by this pitiful president. Rich people actually create jobs, liberal pansy!
@VileTweets Would you please find some other vile quotes I've said or been involved with? Seeing the same ones are getting boring!
@bmangh The whole Black Panthers overturned case?! Are you kidding?!
@bmangh Racism is racism, no matter the party. Disgusting no matter where you slice it. Difference is Holder's racism is way more dangerous!
All right Cubbies! Great start to the second half! Win this series and start a streak!
@FloridaJayhawk Florida, we're above 10,000, and it's a selloff. I am not panicking over wall street. It will be fine.
@bmangh If you truly want to be fair, how about bringing up the out and out racism by Eric Holder and the DOJ.
@JTTallman You realize even liberal Feingold thought the bill sucked,right?
@Trishcuit 95% of Americans would rather pay attention to Lindsay Lohan, then hide in a corner and panic during bad times.
@JTTallman I know it's about principles. This whole debate isn't about disagreement. I agree with you. I'm just giving the facts to this.
@Trishcuit Doesn't matter the party sometimes. Some people just don't have guts. I've had to learn that the hard way.
@JTTallman What I'm saying is that if Feingold didn't raise a ruckus, Brown doesn't become important, and damaging provisions stay
@Trishcuit Trish, Repub or Demo, he's a politician, and in liberal friendly Mass. Shitty as it is, he does what he does to keep his job.
@JTTallman Trust me man......we could be so much worse off. Doesn't mean we like this shitty bill, but we could've been in deep shit.
@JTTallman Not even close JT. Bankers are still going to profit heavily. It just burns the ones, the poor and middle class, it was to help.
@Conservative_76 I know that and you know that, but the left wing pansy professors want to see everyone make as little as them.
@Conservative_76 You kidding? Liberals have daily debates on how NOT left Obama is. Panty waists would rather see no competition whatsoever.
@mzagorski Very true about Brown, but Feingold is the one to thank. Causes Obama to concede the bank tax, which would destroy the consumer.
@mzagorski I know that. The rich won't be hurt, which pisses off liberals. It shows that when you aim at destroying one class, all get hit.
@MarcieDreyer clean television is taboo to a cynical public. It's about the money, and big 3 shows average 18 mos. HBO averages 5 years.
@Conservative_76 And no way in hell will anyone pull the trigger on taking over a company while public dissent is this ugly. Be the end.
@mzagorski Tell you this. Obama's self serving style is killing him. Conservatives say he's a socialist, liberals think he isn't left, etc..
@mzagorski That's every politician then. Everyone does what it takes to keep their job. Unfortunate circumstance but true.
@TxJogger12 Good job Perry!
@TxJogger12 Getting way too close to call! Widen that lead, damn it!
@Conservative_76 I caught it, but did you ever catch what Obama REALLY wants to do with financial reform? Trust me, we've dodged a bullet.
@MarcieDreyer Saw that coming 1000 miles away when they allowed GD on TV. Big networks are probably happy. They been losing shows to HBO.
@mikepfs Notice a story like this shows up during a down day in the markets? Where was it when we were up 260?
@mikepfs Dude, that bank bill is so cut off at the knees, I don't worry about it. Even most bankers are breathing better after reading it.
@mzagorski I'm GOP myself, but to say he's corrupt is wrong. Neutered, gutless, self serving, and a lemming yes....but I don't think corrupt
Check this video out -- Courtesy Of The Red, White And Blue (The Angry American) http://youtu.be/ruNrdmjcNTc - Toby Keith himself! Oh yeah!
@TexasRV As you say that, every liberal in America starts pulling hair out by the roots. Actually, that's cool. Keep saying that.
@TNADixie Does it ever bother you when phony news stories pop up about TNA's demise, or how bad Hogan supposedly is to your company?
@proudamericans I gotta keep making some insulting tweets about liberals. Getting tired of seeing the same ones from viletweets. Stay fresh.
@proudamericans I like you a lot, but you are way too damned worried. Obama's presidency is caving in, people are fighting, etc....
@TPO_Hisself Wait a minute? Wasn't there supposedly some kind of movement to limit things to one child per family? Haha!
@thebcast Scrawny little bastard, ain't he? Won't matter as he's letting his anger blind him. He'll do something stupid to get arrested.
@Tnamattmorgan Hey Matt, just wanted to say AWESOME MATCH at Victory Road. You are on your game!
@JosephAGallant Wanna know the difference between the US dollar and a liberal? The dollar still has worth.
@ladylibertas93 Why you afraid of him waging war on America? He'll lose that like he loses everything else.
@HeyTammyBruce Offend away. They deserve it.
@Conservativeind In that pic, Obama forgot where the teleprompter was.
@TimOwensby We do not have proper financial education in this country at all. Dave Ramsey and Larry Burkett can only do so much.
@CSteven Sean Penn in that role. "Get off my lawn...please? I'll invite you in for dinner if you do. Here's 10 bucks, please just go away."
@CSteven He's in trouble and he knows it.
@CSteven Just watch, Obama's changing. He played up this whole "I'm not anti-business" crap today. He never ever thought of that before.
@CSteven Imagine a liberal playing that role in Gran Torino....."GET OFF MY LAWN, OR I'LL CALL MY LAWYER AND SUE!!!!!"
@CSteven And Eastwood, and Eastwood's the ultimate BADASS! Remember Gran Torino?!
@CSteven Obama probably didn't see this backlash coming so fast. He has no idea what to do.
@CSteven Damn! Dick York was a liberal?!
@Tnamattmorgan Vince Carter needs to go to bad teams to boost ticket sales. Guy's not a winner, and never will be.
@CSteven 18 seats to take over, and Repubs lead in 20 so far....including Connecticut. That's a big ouch to libtards.
@exposeliberals Sawed off angry little runt. Probably used to get his ass kicked at school all the time.....by his sister.
@Turbothink YEEOOOUUUUCHHH! PMSNBC can't even cover that up. I love it!
@Tnamattmorgan Oops, my bad. Forgot that for a second. I'll reiterate. Wonder if Byron Scott will bail out. Mike Woodson's available, haha.
@CSteven This election's going to be ugly for them.
@elianabenador I could just see that. While you are sleeping, you go ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!! Haha.
@davidhanscom Don't climb the ladder, be the ladder - Me.
@Tnamattmorgan No doubt. Watch him hyping $1 concession nights on Saturdays to half full crowds.
@Conservativeind Oh I'd be the same way. My personality's way too fired up for a job like that.
@elianabenador God Bless. Have a good night.
@elianabenador Don't climb the ladder, be the ladder - Me, of course.
@elianabenador Eh, I can take or leave Palin. I'd rather have Chris Christie or Romney or Pawlenty myself. Guys who have balanced budgets!
@Tnamattmorgan What do you bet Tom Izzo's taking off now?
@Tnamattmorgan It's why you are my favorite.......I know all you think about is being the absolute best. That's all it ever should be.
@Tnamattmorgan Gilbert was concerned about the immediate cash flow, not really the ring. I think about the rings....all times.
@elianabenador And that we do not quit.
@elianabenador Teach them how to fight, and never ever give in, no matter the circumstances. This predicament we are in shows our guts.
@elianabenador And when people are producing something, and helping their families, they feel so accomplished and confident.
@elianabenador We need a leader that let's WE THE PEOPLE bring this country back, and not expect the govt to do all the work.
@elianabenador I still look at the gutsy people who did what it took to survive. They knew they had no choice, and acted like it.
@elianabenador Unfortunately, most people aren't prepared for life. They choose "stability", then cry when it's not there. They aren't ready
@elianabenador And those employees put their kids through school and college, paid off houses, etc...... That kind of economy always helps.
@elianabenador What we need is the GM economy back. I call it that because of all the manufacturing that kept workers employed for so long.
@elianabenador Nature of the beast forever. Michael Moore and his huggers will continue to throw furniture in disgust. They deserve failure.
@Tnamattmorgan Hey, can you blame Gilbert? He only lost his meal ticket, and never planned a team around him just in case. 15 wins next year
@elianabenador If not for them, we'd have caps on executive pay, and government would've taken over a lot more.
@elianabenador I've read up on this. We'd be more fragile without the banks, bad as they have been. Their lobbyists have blocked bad things.
@elianabenador Your son gets it, unlike liberals. I call liberal a four letter word for a reason.
@elianabenador A liberal's mind is about the average of 6 years old. Help everyone, no matter what, and they won't do anything wrong.
@elianabenador Irritates the liberals, but nothing else is strong right now, and that's their fault too. We need JOBS and INDUSTRY!
@elianabenador This economy shows why Capitalism will always stay around. Wall Street shows that it's the only strong deal right now.
@TexasRV PMSNBC = Well, PMSNBC
@PoliticalJules Problem is that five unicorns were killed out of spite.
@elianabenador Question. Why do you forgo the O in God?
@elianabenador Those people had to walk miles to find jobs. They had to do things like build things and grow food. Not ideal for a liberal.
@elianabenador Oh if government quit assisting them, most would probably die. They'd really suck if they lived in the Great Depression.
@elianabenador They must've been liberal.
@elianabenador I know. Someone breaks into a Liberal's home, and they have a campfire waiting, and are singing Kum By Ya.
@JackieParkey Unfortunately, but that won't last. He's lost so many independents and supporters, he'll be out. Then a real leader shows up.
@MortalDEElight Yeah, but Olbermann and Madcow would flog them on PMSNBC, and that's the libs' #1 sounding board.
@elianabenador Exactly. Expect everything handed to them. If government existence didn't exist, they'd fall apart.
@JackieParkey You are so passionate about humanitarian things, but your useless president presides over the worst oil spill ever. Sweet!
@MortalDEElight Libs are crazy, but they abhor violence of any kind.
@MortalDEElight And the Panthers must know that they have to tread very lightly. They kill a guy like Beck, even the libs will turn on them.
@RiverRoads Then the badass progressives like Carter, Clinton, Obama, etc..... Any questions?
@RiverRoads Think of the Conservatives in the past 25 years. Reagan, Bush, Bush + the ones now. All ready to handle themselves if needed.
@RightWingTalk What are they TEACHING in divinity school?!
@MortalDEElight Tell you this.....we'll find out a lot about Beck in that showdown. If he shows, he's got balls, and a new fanbase.
@RiverRoads Wanna know what's funny. If Palin was the President, she WOULD fight Putin. She's a spunky little chick. Not scared of anything.
@MortalDEElight What's sad about that.....he'll have to take White Supremacists help if he wants out in one piece, and he'll look bad for it
@CrabbyCon Yawn!!!! This will end ugly for that niche group.
@RiverRoads Putin's a badass. Wish we had George Bush around right now. Say what anyone will, he did not take shit like that from anyone.
@MortalDEElight Oh dear lord, it's like two groups of the least popular kids in school going at it. No one will root for either to win.
@Jihadihunter She didn't strap one on......they are actually his. They have been in her purse for years.
@pubrelationprof It's what I can't stand. Just are incapable of waiting for something good to happen. Bide your time.
This makes me so proud, even if it was late 2007. This is OUR COUNTRY! DO NOT FORGET IT! http://bit.ly/a2szZn
@PolarCoug Probably did sleep in his clothes......next to his Sugar Child "Lawrence".
@junerenner Oh I've been spreading this song around, trust me on that. Also been spreading God Bless The USA, and Real American.
@Conservativeind Saltines kick major ass.
Cool! Cubs-Dodgers game has a 7th inning God Bless America rendition. Didn't think I'd hear this in L.A.
@PolarCoug Ask Chris Farley.
Watching Cubs-Dodgers right now. Feels so good to hear a REAL baseball announcer like Vin Scully. He's the last of a breed.
@BarrySux The better thing to say is "They won't be questioned when he leaves office"
@BarrySux We still have them. FOX news doesn't exist if freedom of the press was taken away, and us tweeters would be in jail by now.
@BarrySux @barbiesnow Can't stand American exceptionalism. Probably because there's nothing exceptional about her, or even mediocre.
@LukeRomyn What about "Not to cut you off, but.....", or "Not to change the subject....". It's like "Well, both of us just did that, haha."
@Turbothink Hey, they lost the moratorium appeal, so what's to keep them from losing Arizona?
@TexasRV It's obvious this Barbie was named well. About as air headed as the doll of the same name.
@barbiesnow Whatever you wanna think, liberal. You libs have done more to ruin this country with your hypocrisy than anything.
@barbiesnow The one with low self esteem is you. That has to be the only explanation for blindly following such an inept liberal like Obama!
@gidgey Most people want to be given everything. It also shows that most people would rather bitch and moan than do anything about it.
@ProudoftheUSA Slim is better than the zero it started out at. Wait a couple weeks and the liberal networks will follow.
@GregWHoward All honesty, I think a 79 year old Soros is our saving grace. A younger one would be so damaging. Probably run for president.
@Streetglidin09 He's a sawed off runt, and most bullies are.I'd say it's a Napoleon complex, but Napoleon's exhumed body could kick his ass.
@gidgey White America hasn't given him nothing, and that includes things like tact, social grace, or proper grammar skills.
@uprightinusa If this country did everything that sea cow Garafalo wanted, she'd get pissed that there was nothing to get pissy about.
@RiverRoads you think that sawed off little runt Shabazz is going to cause a 60s like war? There are black people that think he's crazy.
@tjholthaus Naw, Pat Robertson has everyone beat in nuttiest evangelical status.
@formatted_dad Here's the funny thing. By rule, neither black or white are colors. Both are absence of color.
@Streetglidin09 depends on how many of those angry numbskulls there were around the human bullhorn. Plus it looked like he was mocking them.
@PollySigh1 Arianna Puffington sounds like Barbara Walters chewing with her mouth full. She's a big annoyance, like a peanut in the molars.
@pubrelationprof Man, it's so easy to kick something when down. I can't bet Philly makes the playoff, but they WILL make a run. Bet on it!
@Hargoosh I'd love to see Chris Christie give it a shot. He balanced a huge budget in New Jersey, and we need that help right now.
@andilinks What's left of them
@ShanPoe They look like an absolute joke. There's video of a black guy mocking them by putting his arm around his white girlfriend.
@Hargoosh Imagine when Brewer beats Obama? How would Obama even contest her in an election?
@Hargoosh Jan Brewer is going to beat Obama, and that's going to propel her so high. Better just forget facing her in November then.
@KLSouth Be a pretty unfair fight. What do they have? 10-12-15 members MAYBE?!
@Hargoosh HAHAHAHA! Come on now...REALLY?! The guy's already on cracked ice. You think he's going to pour more gas on the fire?!
@ElectaR2010 Stumping for Reid and Carnahan? That's two less liberals we'll have to worry about then.
@EternalRiteWing Oh election day is going to be so entertaining.
@KLSouth Problem is the band consists of a kazoo, a concertina, and two recorders.
@KLSouth I agree. I went GOP in my Dad's memory. I want to bring back his form of GOP.....ones that created jobs, wealth, and infrastructure
@KLSouth And he'll bust his ass to make sure we get to the single biggest day in U.S. history. A liberal's work is never done.
@glenasbury You ever get the feeling Keith has his bedroom wallpapered with pictures of Saul Alinsky, kinda in the vein of One Hour Photo?
@KLSouth That advantage is shrinking. Repubs lead in senate races in like 20 states right now. All they need is 18 to take over.
And don't forget this girl - Krista Branch - I Am America - http://bit.ly/a1Sscn
@mikepfs CENK UYGUR?! Sounds like a rejected pro wrestler name, or the worst set of letters you could get in Scrabble at one time.
@pubrelationprof What's to keep them from actually making a run at the end? 162-0 is impossible.
This goes without saying - God Bless The USA - Lee Greenwood - http://bit.ly/crAnrd
Another one not voting Kagan. Johnny Isakson from Georgia refuses to do it. That's four that have come out now.
@IndyEnigma NA NA NA NA......NA NA NA NA.......You finish the rest.
RT @FlemingandHayes: YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE THIS ONE... SERIOUSLY. READ IT AND SHARE.... http://fb.me/sBz2LVFd
@avchavis They sure as hell beat your "Punish the successful, give everything to the poor" crowd that you root for.
@USMCNamVet1968 Not going to happen. They've attempted, and will attempt, to make it happen, but it won't. We've had too much fight in us.
@iheartresults Just from the shortened version of links.
@SaraJoAnthony I'm guessing 15.
@KLSouth Pay raises for what? Unemployment?
@AmatoTalk Rick, it's OUR fight. WE THE PEOPLE! Free markets will get us out of this mess over time!
@KLSouth Ummmm paging Quincy...paging Quincy! The rest of Illinois needs to follow your example. Teach them stat!
@ARMVIN DAMN! I hadn't heard his name before other than a couple years ago. Was he a career minor leaguer?
@hipEchik Let Amato know this. If we're in a depression, WE THE PEOPLE have to get out of it. It has to be our fight.
@ARMVIN Damn! How old is he?! He can't be that old!
@ARMVIN 1984......thank Mr. Irsay for that one.
@proudamericans There is no hope......only guarantees.
@ARMVIN Yeah.
@MrsDaschofsky You are pretty, that's why. She's afraid you might rile George up, haha.
@ARMVIN WHEN my Cubbies when it all, it'll have been worth it. Till then, just keep watching.
@ARMVIN You gotta be kidding.
@MrsDaschofsky Oh, I KNOW! He does the work by himself, so he doesn't hire anyone, which causes the unemployment to rise! That's the ticket!
@ARMVIN I'm a Cubbie through and through, but I want Yankee success.....PERIOD! I will not hate anyone with lots of money.
@ARMVIN Most fans are hypocritical wimps anyway. They hate the Yanks for dominating, and yet they would want their team to do the same.
@PolitixGal Hell, that's our society right now. Excellence is an evil word, especially to liberals.
@Lostmybeer Eh, it's pro wrestling at times. Beat each other up, then have a beer in a bar afterwards.
@MrsDaschofsky Hey, he's caused all those lost jobs just clearing brush off his property. That takes talent.
@ARMVIN One of my best buddies is a Yanks fan, and since I'm full blown capitalist, I do have a soft spot for the Yanks.
@Lostmybeer There's a hilarious story I read once about the Grand Wizard of the KKK, and the head of the black church of NC being chummy.
@ARMVIN Like a toothache, but I hate the White Sox more. Eh, I love my Cubbies, but I feel good that other Cubs fans feel pain. Not kidding.
@Lostmybeer Eh, least Byrd learned the error of his ways. Thurmond on the other hand.......
@Lostmybeer Hey, to be the grand wizard, you have to be southern democrat, remember?!
@Lostmybeer Trust me, even the only thing good about Progressive Insurance is that the spokesperson's easy on the eyes.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN67KJdd6Mw&feature=youtu.be Anyone get the feeling this guy wasn't hugged very much as a child?
@mornic1 You see that whole Black Panthers thing today?
@mornic1 And when you get big, you gotta let me act in one of your movies.
@Lostmybeer Uh Oh, you can't admit ethnic people can be stupid too. You might be a racist.....or something.
@mornic1 Give it time......keep working on it. It will happen.
@mornic1 Hit the New York Times #1 best seller yet?
@Lostmybeer I have zero problem with his race. I have plenty with his incompetency.
@Lostmybeer Absolutely
@mornic1 Hey, I'm not rich or successful yet......but give it time. So how long you been writing?
@alexashrugged Someone wasn't hugged as a child.
@Lostmybeer Depends on their jobless benefits.
@mornic1 I've written 5-6 screenplays, and am doing a 7th now. Will be shooting it also in a couple months.
@futureicon That's what he wants to do anyway. When he's out of office, that'll be his position.
@mornic1 Never mind.....erotic romance writer. Nothing wrong with that, haha. I'm actually working on an acting career, believe it or not.
@mornic1 Upcoming release? What do you do?
@PolarCoug Remember Cliff Clavin and Dr. Crane attempting to fight on Cheers, and they have rules? That's Obama in a fight.
@ARMVIN The way other Cubs fans treated that man and his family.....they don't deserve a title.
@ARMVIN Cubs fan here. In this bad season, I have to have something to cheer about, heh. I am rooting for Dusty to slap Cubs fans around.
@mornic1 What's up sexy conservative?!
@BarackProblema You know what's sad. There will be young intelligent black political figures that will stand no chance because of this admin
@kaylaanderson Hell, the MANSON family is more functional.
@RiverRoads This will always survive. There will be riots when he's out of office too.
@CobaltBlue2009 Heh, remember when the space program was supposed to be the liberal strength?
@ARMVIN KICK ASS!
@TexasRV The way most of our country's eating, they'd have to install junk food vending machines in those divots.
@gidgey The Panthers are just like any other bullies. They'll cut and run when they find out they can't intimidate the masses.
@EternalRiteWing You have a DM
@KLSouth No way.
@gidgey I hear the new panthers have less of a budget than the old guard. They only have two clubs to beat people with, and have to share.
@WildMan021 Ever see the scene in Swingers where they play par 3 golf, and they count how many strokes from the green? That's Obama's game.
@Jihadihunter Eh, it had a couple chicks.....but it might as well been a background player.
@WildMan021 Hell, he does that at Pebble Beach.
@Jihadihunter Not talking the shitty movie. I'm talking George Peppard.....you know, a REAL actor?
@Jihadihunter We need Hannibal from the A-Team to say "I love it when a plan comes together"
@proudamericans He's really not a threat anymore. When he was popular, the ideas he wanted got squashed. We fought back, and he's finished.
@GabbyTheLizard No threats......just promises. We aren't enslaved, and we never will be. Remember, it's WE THE PEOPLE!
@ianessling You know liberals. They have lots of time to think up that intelligent rhetoric. They make just enough from welfare to stay home
@ConservativeGal We've had those multitude of fools for generations. It doesn't matter. They will still always be the minority.
@billyhallowell Hey Billy, what happened to rockdemocracy? You stopped updating it.
@theGOPalliance He can't. It's just the idea that stopping drug lords is the most racist thing to do.
@pubrelationprof Awful? You Philly fans need to lighten up. They are always contending, and has even won. Don't go there with the bitching.
@jesusucsb You have this idea that us conservatives are racists. Some of the biggest southern hick redneck KKKers WERE DEMOCRATS!
@GregWHoward Oh they are going to smack him around so bad, it's going to make Ray Romano look badass by comparison.
@GabbyTheLizard One nation, UNDER GOD, indivisible, with liberty and justice FOR ALL!
@proudamericans You have a DM
@GabbyTheLizard I'm not a candle, I'm a blowtorch. I need you, and whoever you know, to be also.
@GregWHoward Pennsylvania? Connecticut? Ok, Dems are in a LOT of trouble. May only be GOP by name, but those three letters burn libs asses.
@GabbyTheLizard It's up to WE THE PEOPLE! I will bust my ass, but will you help me? Will anyone else help me? I'm not afraid of the fight.
@proudamericans No hoping....just doing. That's why we're Americans, and liberals would rather be hiking in Europe and not making money.
@jesusucsb Would you please shut up, liberal! Every poll says they are for the Arizona law! EVERY SINGLE ONE!
@dncfail Levi was a kid. Kids do dumb things. He also got his ass kicked by the Palins and he knows it. He's learning.
@theGOPalliance Oh PLEASE! Way more than 57%! PMSNBC even admitted that like 90 or so percent favored this law.
@proudamericans I wake up every day with a positive attitude. I know that, in the end, our country will be as exceptional as ever.
@Jihadihunter Doesn't matter party affiliation with Illinois. They just need to do a reset button on the video game of life.
@GabbyTheLizard O's first year in the White House. The stuff he WANTED...oh lordy. We can thank lobbyists and bankers for stuffing him.
@proudamericans I'd be more worried if Obama's presidency wasn't falling apart every single second of the day.
@GabbyTheLizard And win....don't forget win.
@tjholthaus Kagan is to moderates like Mr. Drysdale was to charitable giving.
@liv4lyfe2 Thanks sweetie. You are a doll.
@GabbyTheLizard We all have our problems with Obama, but after reading this one book today, I can say this..we could be much worse off.
@exposeliberals NASA = North American Sharia Alliance.
@GabbyTheLizard More like minions.
@elemonader And he said it in Racine, Wisconsin......king of the 14% unemployment.
@TxJogger12 She's going to win this too, I can just feel it.
@GovBrewer Fight Governor Brewer! Fight like hell! You WILL win this!
@TheAtleeAppeal From one Atlantan, and one conservative, to another.....good to meet you man. Way to keep up the fight!
@DesertCactus WAY too late for that. He's way too chummy with Muslims.
@KatMcKinley You live, you learn.
@elianabenador Easy solution. Just vote for people like us, haha.
@elianabenador To me, PC means piece of crap. Always will.
@elianabenador To me, it's not IF we survive, it's WHEN. Look at the amount of people turning their back on Obama.
@BarackProblema Either way, it affects his presidency. I think he thought he'd have the same blind followers, and he could run roughshod.
@elianabenador Eliana, love you, you are a sweetie, but the thing we need is leadership that knows WE THE PEOPLE must get this country back.
@chucktodd Fighting the President at that.
@retiredfirecapt Watch him announce a run for president. I bet you anything.
@LiliaEP It'll come back to haunt him.
@elianabenador Well, Obama's getting into a pissing match with Roberts, who just might make a certain decision on Obamacare.
@elianabenador Where in my language am I defending Barack Obama?
@elianabenador The answer is easy, not the outcome. Too close to call for me, but until things change, any radical idea is going down 5-4.
@avchavis See, if it was actually deficit reduction, I might care. But you limpdick liberals love weakness and everyone being equal.
@elianabenador Easy. Supreme Court cannot be vetoed, and Obama is picking a fight he cannot win. Plus there's the little Obamacare thing.
@junerenner June, America's long woke up by now. Obama is falling apart. Liberals are turning their back on him, and even Pelosi has also.
@lesliecarbone Leslie, a Repub has a double digit lead in a senate race IN CONNECTICUT! Dems also can't get fund raising. It's over.
@lesliecarbone Obama is not only finished as a president, but the dems will have to completely change strategy to gain favor again
@1ststarfighter Does Obama really want to pick this fight? He can't veto the guy, or run him. Plus the repeal of Obamacare runs through him.
@lesliecarbone Hell, libs are turning their back on Obama. Don't think he's LEFT enough.
@Jarjarbug The 26 percent that strongly approve of Obama.
@reimagin Ash Soular is her name. Friend her, she's on Twitter.
@Jarjarbug You really need an answer to that?
@lesliecarbone Compared to Obama, he's Goldwater

@dentay85 Stay as sexy as they want to be! Just because libs are incapable of sexiness doesn't mean conservatives have to follow suit!
@KLSouth Not if his problems continue to mount like they are.
@free_US_Citizen Puffington Post? You surprised?
RT @FoxNewsMom: If comments are smoking gun everyone's been talking abt from the beginning, Obama has serious problems on his hands: htt ...
@FoxNewsMom HOOOOO boy! First report outside of the conservative blogs. This could get really ugly.
@petxpert We'll keep fighting the good fight.....and win like all Americans do.
@residenttroll It's actually a one page pamphlet. It says "What Women Want.......Men to bow down and worship them....and lose rights to vote
@reimagin Part of my workout routine every single. Line them up, swing hard, watch them drop. Wish they'd fight back, I'd like a challenge!
@Jihadihunter Yeah, he dropped a quarter. Apology totally necessary.
@Mary_Burgess You do look pretty tough, so no surprise ;)
@reimagin That's every single day ending in Y for me.
@residenttroll Eh, it's like the uglier older sister who is jealous of the younger beautiful one who could get dates.
RT @petxpert: "FOXNews.com - Should the American Flag Be Banned -- in America?" ( http://bit.ly/ak0YsK ) VOTE NO!  Are these people NUTS ...
@petxpert What the HELL?!
@ConservativFeed Friend Ash Soular. She's on Twitter. I just gave her a congrats, and keep fighting tweet.
@Mary_Burgess Haw! Sounds like the formula for most of those muscle drinks.
@residenttroll Figures.
@ashsoular Ash, keep making that music! Don't let those libs scare you! Speak the truth and we're going to win!
@MissSnarky Like all liberals, they are dibblers and dabblers, but they  don't have any jobs, or ways of making money. They hate money!
@residenttroll Speaking of liberal organizations, do you think Patricia Ireland, bigwig of NOW, is Kathy Ireland's uglier older sister?
@SaraJoAnthony As long as it isn't Code Pink.
@Jihadihunter The check bounced.
@Vicky_Nissen Ahhh, the CPUSA. Formed from a bunch of kids picked last in kickball every single time!
@rsmccain That explains the stupidity of this country right now.
@Wanpeirui All government ones of course.
@mikepfs Or TRY to win people over. Won't work.
@mikepfs I just said this a few minutes ago. Watch Obama get more "patriotic", and do things he hated before to win people over. Inevitable!

@residenttroll I call them the ACL-Puke for a good reason.
@ccoalition That's like saying you are twice as likely to get dehydrated in the desert.
@CFHeather Love America or leave it! Unless you can't afford it! Haha!
@GregWHoward It's going to get interesting these next few months.
@CobaltBlue2009 Don't panic, or even worry. It's all falling in on the MSM, and Obama. Just keep watching, and let's all keep fighting.
@residenttroll More like a $5 donation will get you a free passport out of the States.
@GregWHoward Probably explains why Obama's golfing partners keep telling him the wrong golf courses to go to.
@Kasons4 Yeah, a less embarassing name....like Harry Dix.
@blackbeltncrazy I mean it doesn't matter if it's people on the show or viewers. Six of one, half dozen of the other.
@blackbeltncrazy Pick and choose.
@WildMan021 Finally, someone other than me speaks the truth!
@blackbeltncrazy Actually, they are all feminazis, so they hate men anyway.
@GregWHoward Last night, Obama tried looking like a patriot to win people over. You will be seeing this more as the weeks go by. It's over!
@JENin140 Thank you nutcase. Now go to your room, eat some milk and cookies, and we'll call you for dinner.
@blackbeltncrazy I think liberals watch the show for pointers on picking up dates.
@Kasons4 Harry Reid's kid is going to get embarassed too.
@notalemming I thought Hulk Hogan ushered in the New World Order...BROTHER!
@hipEchik Krugman's like a poor man's Michael Moore, only without the right wing sensibilities.
@TPO_Hisself HUH! I GET NO RESPECT!
@blackbeltncrazy It's called your IQ is dropping 100 points every time you turn that dreck on! Turn on Kardashians for an IQ boost!
@futureicon Amazing people still think this way after all these years.
@Jihadihunter That might be entertaining for about two seconds.
@Hargoosh I know he's gone, and I'm proud of that. I'm saying the NRA refuses to take a chance to support Angle.
@Hargoosh No, they KNOW Schumer and Durbin would really clamp down, where Reid would be "easier", if you will.
@Jihadihunter But if you touch a hair of their beard.....the 72 vestal virgins are no more.
@GregWHoward This presidency's going to make Bush look like a hero, and it hasn't taken long to get there either.
@mikepfs Unless it gets repealed.
@Jenevalynne Probably more now that the country is fighting like hell.
@GregWHoward I heard something about Justice Roberts having a say. What's that about?
@Jenevalynne Rick Monday was awesome for that. Now Obama would probably tell him to apologize to the flag burners for impeding their rights!
@IAmJacksBot No one is exceptional in liberal fight club, but everyone is special.
@GregWHoward Liberals don't work out.....muscles are too masculine. The machetes would be too heavy.
@avchavis You are so naive. You cannot regulate or legislate morality. Socializing everything just turns us into Venezuela!
@First_Patriots Janeane Garafalo's so left, she drives on the wrong side of the road.
@hipEchik I read a chapter of that 1st year in office Obama book. There were a ton of socialist ideas that lobbyists squashed!
@GregWHoward What is a liberal death threat? They hold a replica of the constitution at knifepoint and hope you fall for it.
@GregWHoward I said it earlier. Tea partiers need to learn how to protect themselves. No way should a liberal win ANY fights!
@Ericatwitts You tease!
@hipEchik HAW! Google lobbyists will shut this sucker down so fast!
@Jihadihunter Imagine a liberal Fight Club? "The first rule of liberal fight club is no hitting". "The second rules is we'll sue if you do!"
@Hargoosh I think it's NRA getting a case of the cowardice. They are just afraid if Repubs don't win majority, Durbin or Schumer lead dems.
@Hargoosh Funny about the NRA supporting Reid because they don't think Repubs can get majority. They think it's better the devil they know.
@avchavis NOT GOVERNMENT! Too much government's just going to break us! I am GOP conservative to try to bring my Dad's brand of GOP back!
@avchavis I'm going to be honest with you. I am not thrilled with this current crop of GOP. I want US AS CITIZENS to lead this country back!
@Jihadihunter If they can stay there, I have no problem with that.
@MissSnarky Unemployment ran out for most people, haha. At this point, I think they moved into Mom's basement.
@futureicon The UN is what he wants to preside over when this term's over anyway, so are you surprised?
@avchavis Liberalism is not only a mental illness, but a four letter word. How does it feel to want everything handed to you?
@Jihadihunter I'm from Quincy, IL originally. 6.3% unemployment there. Doing everything right.
@JennyErikson You know, as goofy as Walker, Texas Ranger could be, we REALLY could use someone like him now on the borders.
@avchavis Liberals have their usual lies, no jobs, and a bad economy to offer.
@MissSnarky Helen Thomas has age for an excuse, and Pelosi sold her soul to the devil for those looks. Kagen's just ugly as hell.
@Hargoosh Carnahan's finished.
@avchavis You realize Repubs need 18 states to do it. They are leading in 20 so far. Dems can't even get fund raisers. They are done.
@VisedMonk We're exceptional, and always will be.
@GregWHoward Anything beats liberals, but let me tell you this. What I pin my hopes on is US DOING THE JOB!!!!!! Greg, PM me, let's talk.
@avchavis And Repubs will take over in November. Dems have had the majority, and are too limpdicked to do anything with it.
@erikrush Uncle Phil from fresh prince
@GregWHoward Don't worry......only a few months away.
@avchavis You say it plenty, but as usual, your limpdick liberals are doing nothing to help. They deserve to fail the way they are now.
GAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! Now I'm going to have nightmares!!!! Not a good pic to go to when you hit a website! http://www.politico.com/
@LilMissSocial Don't even go there. Limpdick liberals have the majority(not for long, of course), so they are blocking it too.
@SillyLiberals Well liberals and dead dogs are one in the same. They just fall over and die.
@PMgeezer And with PELOSI turning her back on him, his presidency is falling apart day by day.
@TJ_Hancock All this will do is make the next president destroy the Muslim hope that much more, and for popularity purposes.
@Jihadihunter She's an actress? I thought that was horrible mugging to the camera.
@ConservativFeed He's losing his whole staff one day at a time. Losing complete control.
@CobaltBlue2009 My friend, it's up to us. There will be more of those, but that's just a start.
@TxJogger12 Then we just might have to fight fire with fire.
@James_E_Gordon And he'll lose for it. First in November, then 2012. Even liberals are turning from him, and for not being left enough, haha
@CobaltBlue2009 Nah nah nah nah!!! Nah nah nah nah! HEY HEY HEY!!!!! GOODBYE!!!!
@Jihadihunter Appreciate the tweet on my video man. We have to get the word out.
@GregWHoward Greg, we'll see. It very well could happen, but we HAVE to just realize that success is up to us, and not them! Stay patient.
@erikrush I love what you do man, but you look like a merger between Common and Uncle Phil, haha.
@NatalieDuvalNY Just imagining Obama going....OH PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASEEEEEEEE treat Muslims right! They'll be good this time, promise!
@FloridaJayhawk With Obama going "Better not be that green tea shit! That stuff's nasty!"
@GregWHoward Appreciate your RT yesterday man. The clip's getting around, that's for sure. It's only been up about 12 hours though, haha.
@PollySigh1 It's time for some of these teabaggers to learn how to fight. Liberals should not be beating ANYONE up.
@grammy620 Probably Michelle using it to get the mail, laundry, etc....
@grammy620 I know. Anytime I drive by any golf course, I am looking for him.
@NatalieDuvalNY Obama's REALLY desperate right now. He's trying anything to gain an approval rating, so he wants no more negative press.
@USMCNamVet1968 Because it would mean actually trying to piss someone off. Can't do that in this administration.
@EdMorrissey About as shocking as water making you wet when you jump in. Wall Street goes with what's popular....and Dems are not popular.
@pauline_ma More like Dem platform.....pick the year.
@KurtSchlichter And in the case of Kagan.......walruses.
@maggie82 Just wait. Libs are turning on him left and right. Enviros are the last to go. If he doesn't pass cap and tax, it's over.
@PMgeezer It's not credit, it's just the truth. He has charisma, but no guts. If he had guts, he'd vote against liberals in a liberal state.
@bmangh It'll be the Knicks or Nets. King James Inc, his company, is in New York. He wants to be the first billionaire.
@tnlawgirl Adversity introduces a man to himself. This is a time not to cower, but to stand up. I'm ready.
@PMgeezer More like took the bank tax out. Remember that he's a politician, Repub or Democrat. In Mass, if he's too Right wing, he loses.
@tnlawgirl Who knew we were going to be fighting this again, huh? I'm ready though.
@JamesGRickards Point I've been making since I've been here. We HAVE to get this country back on our own! We can't cower in a corner.
@KurtSchlichter Repubs are getting killed by this limpdick liberal media over trying NOT to spend. Funny, isn't it?

@SaraJoAnthony Muscle Milk has a SHITLOAD of sugar in it.....horrendous for you once you get a bit older. I always do whey protein myself.
@SaraJoAnthony I want to put on muscle weight though. I think it's real tough for vegans to do that. I do respect them though.

@nikkibama I posted Rick Derringer's "Real American" a few minutes ago. It applies more than ever now.
@KLSouth It's the NRA chickening out, that's all. Don't think Repubs can get majority, so making sure Durbin or Schumer don't get majority.

@Sami_Shamieh Actually 13000 jobs overall, but funny thing is......6700 were from Wall Street, haha.
@proudamericans Oh yeah, I notice. Liberals are turning on Obama at a record rate. Enviros won't be far behind.
@NatalieDuvalNY Repubs have had to change their strategy to look like they are fiscally conservative. Dems will have to eventually also.
@proudamericans Plus they are waiting for that cap and trade thing. If that fails, you'll hear a TON from them against Obama.
@proudamericans They know Obama's wrong. They hate looking bad, so they stay quiet.
@mikepfs Reid's bad for them, but in the way of "I hate guns". Durbin and Schumer are plain bad for business in general.
@mikepfs You realize the only reason is that they are gutless. They don't think Repubs will win majority, and they want the devil they know.
@RiverRoads Obama's congress are afraid to piss off the bankers because their money comes from them.

@RiverRoads Hulk Kagan.....funny. Also insults the boy band looks of Hulk Hogan, haha.

@avchavis Facts according to the liberals.....who really aren't known for facts whatsoever.
@avchavis Don't pretend it's not true.
@avchavis Yeah, like the Dems helped Bush. Bush had to go into business for himself because they were pulling the same shit.
@avchavis No, they vote no on everything because DEMOCRATS WANT TO SPEND MONEY WE DON'T HAVE!!!!!!
@avchavis Always Repubs Repubs Repubs are evil this.....and Conservatives suck that with you! You are no different! I'm just mocking you!
@avchavis Same as you libs not knowing a damned thing either. Far more to the story about Repubs than you wish to know, or care to know.
@avchavis Most of you liberals have had chemical help to find your alternate universe.
@avchavis You haven't even nicked me yet, and never will.
@RiverRoads All she, and the rest of us, have to do is keep fighting. Will have to do it all our lives, but just keep it up. No complacency.
@avchavis Well I'll be damned. First liberal that admits it. Progress! Ok, Obama's my president, but not proud of it.....have a good night.
@RiverRoads All honesty, I think she's going to win this one.
@avchavis If Obama's my president, Bush was yours. Since you won't accept the latter, I'm not accepting the former.
@avchavis Keep being naive. If not now, in November when Repubs take over and start doing investigations.
@avchavis Your president got in bed with that $2 ho. It's going to bite him in the ass.
@avchavis Ask Blago......the whole trial's turning into Obama central, and his part in the scandal.
@avchavis Your president is a bigger thug than any Repub.....and trust me, this latest batch of Repubs have had some thugs of their own.
@Conservativeind Makes you sexier when you do it too.
@Turbothink Very good school.......and continues to grow.
@avchavis You know, it's funny. I'm not going to be harsh for once, haha. You are a Yankees fan, and they are the equivalent of Repubs, haha
@TnSouthernPride I asked because I live in GA now, but I went to Lee.
@TnSouthernPride Just a proud conservative as always. Where in Tennessee are you?
@avchavis Naw, rather see you liberals pissed off. You deserve it.

@Proliberty4ever Oh he's a liberal of the highest sense.
@TnSouthernPride HELLO!
@imsure I'm ready to see a takeover so they can scream. They don't deserve to be happy.
@avchavis Oh no, we both work. Difference is that us Conservatives would rather have infrastructure jobs. Libs want government jobs.
@RiverRoads By far
@Proliberty4ever Dude, he's a liberal lawyer! That's like saying Elena Kagan would prefer to be better looking!
@RiverRoads HA! PC Police were around with Bush too! We just are in a wimpier world.
@avchavis But it might as well be, since most libs want to play Robin Hood without working for anything.
@avchavis Oh yeah, lots of facts......which I never see whatsoever. Funny thing is, I could say all libs want handouts, which isn't all true
@avchavis Yup......same blah blah, as I said.
@avchavis Oh yeah, and you don't? Same blah blah......the rich hold us down....blah blah......help us please!
@PMgeezer Panty waists afraid of PC police. That's got to change.
@RiverRoads More like wimps who are so afraid of the PC police bashing them.
@avchavis Quit being a lying liberal.
@avchavis Feel sorry for them.
@Conservative_76 Obama's health care bill, without a fight, would've been REAL ugly. This bill now....terrible, but at least money is made.
@Conservative_76 Wanna know how much of a disaster the health care and bank tax COULD be if we didn't fight so hard? This could be so worse.
@Turbothink Gotta be real though, Bill Clinton SCHOOLS Obama in all aspects of politics, and life. It'd be a laugher if Obama tried him.
@Conservative_76 Saw the same story. Also saw a story where he said he still doesn't know. I'd bet he'd sign, but there's still unknowns.
@Turbothink HAW! Clinton's probably got thugs waiting for those thugs. You think that guy comes unprepared?
@Conservative_76 Hold the phone. First off, I saw it coming with him being from Massachusetts. Second, he hasn't decided yet.
@TexasRV Boy, Al Bundy would be laughing right now.

@elianabenador That's what I work on every day.
@elianabenador If you ever saw my old posts here, I say it's up to us all the time.
@elianabenador But I trust we will continue to fight and get through this. There is no choice.
@elianabenador Actually, I know this. I said to people the reason of Obama being in is George Bush's policies.
@elianabenador Been a fun debate. Let's win this thing! Have a great day.
@elianabenador Yeah, but the liberals are at an all time low in good standing.
@elianabenador Put it this way. You know those post apocalyptic movies everyone rolled out in the 80s? We'd be closer to that at this point.
@elianabenador Just wait till November, my friend. It'll be a great victory.
@SavannahGuthrie Hell, you usually see Chuck Todd tweet "ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ" while he's sleeping.
@elianabenador Oh I understand that. I just meant that America CAN be saved. Obama's policies, in the forms he wanted, would've ruined us.
@elianabenador That's why they will get there. I'm one of many that will not quit believing, and quit fighting.
@elianabenador What worries me is if Repubs win this one, Obama will just get another heavily liberal choice, and then another.....
@elianabenador And that's exactly what I'm doing. I just know, from the past few months that, oh lord, things could be a hell of a lot worse
@elianabenador When I say "when it's all over", I mean the tough times. We'll see good times again. It'll take a while, but they'll come.
@elianabenador And that judge was heavily liberal. An old one at that. I don't want her at all, do not get me wrong.
@Conservativeind My family had a vacation home in Hot Springs. Loved it. Great state.
@elianabenador Look, I'm talking about recovering as a nation. What did you think I was talking about?
@elianabenador We just have to keep fighting as a nation. When it's all over, it'll show our resiliency and strength.
@Conservativeind I guess that's why libs exist, haha.
@elianabenador Heh, you are forgetting she's replacing another liberal. She's very bad news, but it'd be worse if it turned 5-4 for libs.
@Conservativeind It's why Clinton tried working with Repubs in the White House. Arkansas is a pretty working class, conservative state.
@Conservativeind Remember that Scott Brown's from Massachusetts. He is trying to make liberals happy to win votes. Unfortunate but true.
@pauline_ma That leaves the other two doubters.
@Conservativeind So he'll support a knees cut version? It's not a good idea by any stretch, but it's not the danger it was, I'll say that

@TxJogger12 You know what it will do, to be honest? Show why we're the best after surviving this disaster of a presidency.
@DesertCactus Good question. We'll probably have a couple days where it goes up, and might even out. Investors like good deals.
@avchavis #thingsliberalswillneversay USA! USA! USA! USA!
@avchavis No, we want the unemployed to GET JOBS! Right now, there aren't any, but that would be because of your government giddy president.

@Steve_yerp Oh yeah. Just get to know me more. You'll see it.
@kansasauthor Kagan is more like if John Wayne Gacy and Janet Reno had a kid together.
@avchavis Oh I can. Just watch PMSNBC and watch the lies spew out. Obama's whole administration is broken promises and lies.
@avchavis We were talking about Bush's incessant spending from 2005! Quit lying, liberal!
@avchavis Libs are born liars.......some are even convicted.
@avchavis Plus the only jobs Obama has brought us are government jobs. Infrastructure, building, and manufacturing are NIL! His bill sucks!
@avchavis The jobs bill has way too much pork in it. We cannot spend more and more without going bankrupt!
@kansasauthor Oh trust me, I know this. But also watch for tea partiers blocking the fraud too. They'll be ready.
@avchavis It's called QUIT SPENDING!!!!!!!!! Bush started it, Obama's spreading it worse! And he's bringing NO JOBS IN!
@avchavis You've NEVER had facts, liberal! You blather a bunch of lies about Repubs, and come up with no solutions!
@Steve_yerp PC means piece of crap. As I said, crude as possible right now.
@avchavis Yeah, there are TARP deadbeats, but Citi, Goldman, and big banks paid.....and it amounted to billions. None went to debt.
@PMgeezer I get your meaning man, and I agree, but she's replacing another liberal, not a conservative. It's still 5-4 us for now.
@OxyConservative And the left want to befriend him and invite him to dinner.
@kansasauthor She's going in anyway, I can tell. But it's hard for her or Sotomayor to make any difference when they get blocked every time.
@avchavis Hell, Obama's a failure without us wishing it on him. Besides, you liberals wished Bush would fail. Hypocrites through and through
@NatalieDuvalNY Just wait till November. It will come before you know it.
@Steve_yerp No, be crude. As crude as it gets.
@kansasauthor It is a sad state, but it still passed with mostly liberals around. Good sign when the conservatives take over in November!
@avchavis Democrats: Dear unemployed. The rich people and banks paid their TARP back, and we didn't use that money to pay off the debt!
@avchavis HAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA! Yeah, the current Repubs have had their problems, but Obama's a trainwreck of epic proportions!
@kansasauthor Who is replacing an older, more senile, left wing nut in the supreme court. Doesn't change the numbers for now.
@kansasauthor Give it a few months. It won't last long. Till then, stay strong.
@FloridaJayhawk Yes we can, and will. We're a resilient country. I have no doubt we'll be back.
@avchavis No, you just need to make excuses for the lazy and unmotivated. I've seen plenty of unemployed that changed their lives. Had guts!
@kansasauthor The judge isn't the huge part. It's a liberal replacing a liberal. Problem is when it's not 5-4 us anymore. Gotta get help.
@avchavis Liberals - IT'S ALL ABOUT ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S ONLY ABOUT YOU IF YOU AGREE WITH ME!!!!!!!
@bmangh Naw, that'd be the liberals......especially ones that terrorize a certain 11 year old boy in California.

@avchavis Problem is......MOST HAVE BOOTS! They are just too lazy to put them on.

@vermontaigne Couldn't be worse. Kennedy's death forced them to cut the knees off the health care bill because of Brown. Now Byrd.
@bmangh More spending we can't afford for more non government jobs that don't exist.
@avchavis And deserves every last bit of it. Also deserves to be one term.
@bmangh Barack Obama's an absolute menace to the banks. They aren't lending because they have no trust that the economy is coming back.
@bmangh Hate the rich all you want, but the current attack on them causes their businesses to leave....thus, no jobs.

@bmangh Obama is putting us in debt we've never seen before, and will be hard to pay back. Quit being a sheep!
@bmangh Losing freedoms would be a good one.
@slingbrush I'm a mean bastard to them, and I don't even drink, haha.
Give a liberal a fish, and he'll eat for a day. Teach a liberal to fish, and he'll just ask you to give him another fish every day.
@Conservativeind What's he masturbate with? Tweezers?
@Dr_Rose Ahhhh, the "Well it's legal in this state" argument? Met people like that before. Absolutely nuts.
@Dr_Rose How the hell you know he's screwing with underage girls?
@Dr_Rose Understandable. It's vile enough that he's a liberal piece of shit that roots for Iran too.
@rightinillinois And just wait till it all fails.
@Dr_Rose Why the hell are you giving that liberal piece of shit danielspengies any time at all?
@rightinillinois Try me. I've been everywhere.
Just want to bring up how proud I am of Team USA today. I wish we would've won, but we're still in this thing. WE'RE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU!!!

@proudamericans Oh we will. Be on the look out for my columns at rockdemocracy.com
@TexasRV And we will
@TexasRV Naw, it smells pretty danged nice. He has the nose up to get a real nice whiff.
@proudamericans I say the same thing. The more we speak out about it, the less it will happen in the future.
@proudamericans Go get the popularity then. Followers and sheep say "What if", leaders say "How can I"
@proudamericans I don't mind that you are a little worried, but if you overly worry, it takes up too much time that you'd have solving this.
@proudamericans We need the leaders, and at the same time, we HAVE to be the leaders.
@proudamericans We've had sheep since forever. It's always the strong that have to lead them. It's why we're leaders and they are sheep.
@Jenevalynne And don't forget that our troops are around that area.
@proudamericans Oh that goes without saying. I think most of our country's a bunch of wimps, including liberals. But it starts with us.
@proudamericans Completely agree, but it has to be up to us. We MUST start the process.
@Americanwoman00 And just think....Obama could've put us in this same predicament.

@bmangh Because we're way too busy trying to save BP from the liberals. They have their faults, but I'm not going to wish their death.
@Soldierjohn I think it's time we really turned up the heat on the libs. Do all the things that made this country great!
@Soldierjohn Just to let you know....I support BP too!
@EternalRiteWing Oh it created jobs all right.....just government ones. Ones that don't count.
@sheriffjim And we refuse to let it totally collapse also.
@bmangh Typical liberal, changing subject when you get an argument beat down. Ok, I'll bite. BP have their faults, but Obama is doing zero.
@DavidOnTap Oh well, we'll have to piss them off more when we beat them in soccer.
@bmangh No, but under Obama, building material purchases are at an all time low, so it sure isn't important labor jobs.

@GregWHoward Boy is Obama ever finished if he pulls something like that.
@EternalRiteWing Dignity and class may have left, but so did liberal spending by a Repub. Now it's worse. Time to get Repubs back on track.
@GregWHoward Yeah, and say what we will, but Bush would've probably sounded a hell of a lot cooler, and more credible, saying it.

@hipEchik That's the only woman that deserves to be barefoot, pregnant, and in the kitchen. Well, her and Whoopi Goldberg.
@mikepfs But of course you know he's drinking Perrier.
@PolitixGal Fiorina vs Boxer is like Cancer vs AIDS. Both will hurt you, one kills less.
@PolitixGal What did she say to them
@tinastullracing Adversity introduces a person to themselves
@hipEchik Carly Fiorina doesn't believe in free speech till she gets her feminazis on the prowl.
@hipEchik Palin could endorse Hulk Hogan, and he'd turn into Mini Me in a snap.
@tinastullracing I just DMed you.
@hipEchik Probably attack him for being a good guy. It's like "Come on, he's a married guy who is loyal to his wife and kids! PANSY!"
@hipEchik I have no doublt DeVore's going to slice her up.
@tinastullracing Hmmmmm.....I'm trying to figure out good possibilities for sponsors. I might have a couple ideas.
@JasonBWhitman What do you think of Pawlenty or Perry?
OBAMA = One Big Ass Mistake America
@EternalRiteWing You realize I can't DM you back if you don't friend me, right? Haha.
@tinastullracing I always say don't climb the ladder...be the ladder. Do what makes you happy, and the money will eventually come.
@tinastullracing Friend me, maybe we can brainstorm.
@tinastullracing Hmmmm, why the trouble finding sponsors?
@Jenevalynne Night
@exposeliberals Perfectly good explanation. Some of them didn't know what no was in Spanish the first time around.
@Jenevalynne Busier than hell, are ya? You must be conservative, haha.
@EternalRiteWing Oh, friend me by the way. I can't answer you back, haha. By the way, I'm from Quincy originally! WB6ers unite!
@mikepfs Remember that inaguration day when Obama supporters went "he's gonna pay my bills". Well, there you go!
Saw Chuck DeVore's opponent and only have one question. Since when did Susan Powter get into politics?
@PolarCoug An Obama action figure would be Obama rolled up in a ball while secret service fights for him.
@tinastullracing Your time will come Tina. Just enjoy life and let it ride. We only get one life. Oh yeah, and kick ass on the circuit too.
@lheal Come on lheal, Libs want everything so far to the left, you could be driving in England. You know that.
#PeopleThatCouldKickObamasAss The CEO of BP
#PeopleThatCouldKickObamasAss Michael Landon
@velvethammer With every Helen Thomas interview, the interviewee, by contractual agreement, must bring colostomy bag.
#PeopleThatCouldKickObamasAss Elmo
#PeopleThatCouldKickObamasAss Joy Behar
@PolarCoug That's not saying much. Woody Allen in a wheelchair could kick Obama's ass.
@PolarCoug Thomas could kick Obama's ass, no doubt. Just make sure there's a puppeteer to move the arms around.
@BoycottBP All of them...even your precious president, liberals. Obama partied with Getty Oil. Quit being sheep and find a solution.
@AntiLib007 Hey, any ass kicking of limp dicks = a real fun night.
@velvethammer If the bag had four holes cut out on each side.
@CrabbyCon He was probably watching DVDs of 2008 with wifey and saw that, then said "I got an idea honey, let's prove I can handle it!"
@velvethammer Oh, what did you think of Obama "kicking some ass" today? Doesn't he just look physically intimidating or what?
@AntiLib007 Hello my friend. Another liberal ass kicker tonight. Can't have enough of those.
@DebbieSchlussel Course she does, she's a lib. If Thomas had killed someone, Whoopi would say that she's old, and deserved to have fun.
@velvethammer Course he did. He probably wanted to say something about it, but it reminded him of Michelle's yawn every time they get it on.
@airpowerspin They are already figuring it out. Obama is not popular right now.
@velvethammer He didn't have a teleprompter telling him to WAKE UP!
@AlinskyDefeater Chicago.
@EternalRiteWing Where in Illinois you from?
@AlinskyDefeater Well, I guess I'm a racist seditionist. Oh well, pass the beer.
@EternalRiteWing Barry's going to kick some ass.....but the CEO doesn't know it yet.
@bmangh Bharat, I agree, and I said that it has to be up to us to get this country back. Are you with us? We could use all the help possible
#AssesMichelleKicked Barack's.....every day
#ObamaToughGuyLines Go ahead, make my decade.
#AssesBarryKicked Mary Smith, this one 1st grader that was bullying Obama. She finally got her comeuppance last week.
@laghid She did get half of the sentence right. She is an old dog. That's about it.
@CrabbyCon Obama kicking ass would consist of him asking Michelle to get his balls out of her purse.
@dasharpshooters Yeah, but Otunga could break his ankles eating cheerios.
Anyone seen the cheers episode where Cliff and Frasier fight, but they have to write out rules before they fight? That's Obama kicking ass.
@laghid Oh absolutely! They are making sure those "capitalist scum" don't show up in Lexuses! Gotta have Prius or nothing at all!
@bmangh Nope, I'm a capitalist. I refuse to see capitalism go down. Obviously, from the looks of it, a lot of others agree with me.
RT @CFHeather: RT @CLAWBACK1: ShoreBank – The Preferred Bank of the Obama Pirates http://ow.ly/1VmbD #crimeinc
Here's a juicy tidbit I bet you didn't know. Wanna know who Obama partied with a few nights ago in his endless party hopping? Getty Oil.
@RatedRepublican More like "I wanna kick some ass.....but I've really never been capable. I'll find someone that can kick ass for me"
@bmangh And I am one of those conservatives. Don't forget that your liberal president gave BP a safety award last year. This is on him.
@BP_America BP, I am writing you to let you know you are not alone in this. I refuse to boycott you, and I want to see a solution to this.
@TxJogger12 Remember buddy, this is our fight. Let's find the solution. We can't trust Obama, so we have to lead the fight.
RT @BoycottBP I added you to say that I am not boycotting BP. Absolutely refuse! Those are independent stations you hurt. I will help them
@BoycottBP I added you to say that I am not boycotting BP. Absolutely refuse! Those are independent stations you hurt. I will work with them
@Jihadihunter Then we either earn more or spend more. As I keep saying, it's got to be our fight, or we're dead, and I'm not ready for dying
@Jihadihunter All I know is that adversity introduces a man to himself. Are we going to cry like a liberal, or do something about it?!
@Jihadihunter And if it does get that low, they'll come back. Those are some sweet deals in the market then
@Jihadihunter Stocks will be back, no question. Always a few with balls to make deals.
@glennbeck To get this country back, we need all of us. Let's remember the guts our ancestors had and make the USA the best again!
@seanhannity To get this country back, we need all of us. Let's remember the guts our ancestors had and make the USA the best again!
@chucktodd wonder if the kid will have a three year shelf life like his dad did.
@MarcieDreyer Libs will spin it that unemployment dropped in that time. It started at 33%
@Jihadihunter Pelosi being out ends the Dems as we know it. Dems will start campaigning on fiscal responsibility after that, you watch.
@Jihadihunter It's amazing how fast this administration is falling apart.
@Jihadihunter Immigrants will win too, that's what is sad
@TxJogger12 Took a year to do that. That's an accomplishment.
@Jihadihunter You expect a Dem to do that? That's like asking Obama to go to church on Sundays.
@TxJogger12 And this time, Billy Crystal will just say "What the hell, pitch her off. I need my peace".
@TxJogger12 I said to someone that she has more time to star in Throw Momma From The Train 2. She'll play Momma.
@capflowwatch Now she'll have more time to work on Throw Momma From The Train 2. She's playing Momma.

@ramseyshow It also weighs about one pound, and has sharp edges. Probably could use it as a weapon of mass destruction, in more than one way
@TxJogger12 Unfortunately, we did, just not at this amount, or this level.
@andylevy Kind of ironic, since she does resemble those old muppets in the balcony that make fun of everything.
@TxJogger12 Remember to call his supporters Ozombies, haha.
@ReaganStyle It's never OK man, but some prefer to put the head in the sand. You are young and ready to speak out, and that's a huge start.
@ReaganStyle Things must change though, before it gets REALLY bad.
@ReaganStyle Out of 25 countries with GDP to debt ratio, we're 25th. Doesn't make it good, but we could be so much worse.
@ReaganStyle I understand you are 17, and I'm proud that you are taking an interest in this, but we're nowhere near close to the worst.
@ReaganStyle Not necessarily. Even when it does, England's at 425% of GDP....Ireland at 1200%
@theRealExTex Good to meet you ExTex. Keep riling up the libs out there in the east!
@capflowwatch Libs not only want their cake and eat it too....but they also want the recipe to go with it.
Good night everyone.

@michellemalkin Ever seen a presidency so sloppy in its execution?
@Kelsey_Grammer Kelsey, we are all proud of you in your quest to bring this country back. We will all help you to the best of our ability.
@PolitixGal And about 20% out of that 25% were at my mall the other day wearing those retarded Obama shirts. I call those people Ozombies.

@PolitixGal Oh come on, you know how tough Carter was on the Ayatollah. I mean the guy had sleepless seconds worrying about Carter!
@JTTallman Nope. I'm 31, and never belonged to one of those, but once you email me, I'm going to email you my idea.
@James_E_Gordon My pops wouldn't belong in Hollywood. He was tough, badass, honest, hard working, and a take charge guy. That scares libs.
@neighhay Shaves it off with a weedwacker every morning.
@JTTallman CRs?
@JTTallman Email me....jw.christner@gmail.com Let's talk
@James_E_Gordon I'm ready to bring MAN back to the forefront. No more of this effeminate male being cool garbage, or idiot male. Just MAN!
@JTTallman Time to get the Conservative mindset back on track......the way it should be. Family, success, wealth, work ethic, and guts.
@JTTallman And to aim for the absolute top! No questions asked! JT, I think you and I are going to be working together on this someday.
@JTTallman The liberal psyche = Trophies for everyone. Competition may hurt everyone's feelings.
@James_E_Gordon Hollywood's too busy emasculating men, and making them look like pansies. Piss too many liberals off if we made them strong.
@JTTallman Well, we made history with the first black president. After this failure, we won't see another one for a VERY long time.
@neighhay Is it just me, or does Maddow look a ton like Adam Morrison without the mustache, and shorter hair?
@JTTallman If he's going to use an oil spill to get cap and trade, he's going to find himself in a war. People are seeing this guy's colors.
@PolitixGal This presidency is so sloppy right now. There's no way he has a second term in him.
@JTTallman You know something.....for such a smart guy, Obama's been SLOPPY AS HELL with his presidency.
@JTTallman He's too busy partying with the competition.....Getty Oil. Look it up, it's true.
@JTTallman YEAH YEAH, NOTHING TO SEE HERE! IT'S JUST THE USA! We have to apologize to Lesotho next, then the Ukraine!
@dpleasant It says you don't tolerate hypocrisy, but you libs reek of hypocrisy with the whole Helen Thomas deal.
@JTTallman I'm just surprised he actually attended a 4th of July party. Thought he'd find an independence celebration in Peru somewhere.
@neighhay Rachel Maddow.
@DavidAHale Pal, you libs would want government regulations on the kind of underwear you choose to wear.

@KeepOutKagan I never thought I'd see the day that Martin Short would be up for supreme court justice till I saw Elena Kagan.
@Jihadihunter Come on man, reading the huffington post is like waterboarding without the pleasure.
@TxJogger12 It's easy to do that. Vast majority of people that have less don't have the gumption to try for more.
@TxJogger12 I don't see near as many, but I still see a couple of Ozombies with his t-shirt.
@velvethammer Love your name by the way, haha
@MarcieDreyer I grew up with that type of Dad. He had that cast iron frying pan to the head honesty. It's time to get that back in the USA
@velvethammer that's the thing about liberals. They are jealous of the terrorists because the blow up dolls took them instead

@pauline_ma Just imagine how bad Obamacare would be if he didn't get cut off at the knees as bad as he did.
@Herfarm Funny you mention this. Obama was supposed to be so anti wall street, and yet they fund him.
@SnarkyBasterd No, Nancy Pelosi's face with Helen Thomas' body.
Folks! With all of this spending by the government, it's time for us to set an example. We start spending cash and setting a standard!

@Ericatwitts Good to meet you Erica. You just proved a point. Conservative women are sexier too. Have a good day.
