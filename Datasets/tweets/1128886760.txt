@thomasqjones “No, really. I need my phone.”
@Smitty74allday @Ky1eLong Usually gonna happen right in the back when you get that tackles inside shoulder turned w the long arm, and then some fat smelly guard is gonna run full speed at your back and knock you and the tackle over and then lay on you and post it on his instagram 🤣
@coach_culler You’re confused.
@Daniel_Penrod11 No one said Tropic Thunder didn’t age well because of RDJs character. You’re just projecting your biases onto my statement. The movie is no longer funny to me in general, which is a subjective assessment. Therefore, you are a fucking moron and maybe assume less.
@Smitty74allday @Ky1eLong Nah I’m not talking about guard help on an inside move, I mean running start, scumbag clean out on a guy who’s standing still pushing on the tackle... plus, yeah... I don’t like running the pick ears bc selfishly I don’t wanna waste a rush I can win. Only to get even.
@Smitty74allday @Ky1eLong Think he’s mad when we run pick Ears and clean out the guard... so I say... stop cleaning out the pocket inside out... until then... here’s the worlds tiniest violin!!
@Smitty74allday @Ky1eLong He’s complaining about the ears stunt, not me. I love it personally...
@coach_culler Man what???
@Ky1eLong Oh Kyle.... The equivalent of a violent ears stunt is y’all cleaning out the pocket from inside out... which isn’t included in this discussion.. we’re all still even https://t.co/QN9dyrmCTk

@DragonflyJonez Twitter wants to turn everything into something big. Kid got excited, learned a lesson. You’ve got bros mad @ Russ bc they don’t like him or think athletes aren’t allowed to have boundaries bc they’re rich.  Twitter sociologists mad at the kid bc he got excited and has good seats
@BarstoolBigCat @PardonMyTake “That stuff”
@EyeAmB Whew I’m glad you don’t think so
@EyeAmB If that’s what you took
He made some good larger points about boundaries and fans postgame. Seats are tight on in the NBA. Not something we deal with in the NFL.
My TL appears to be either “there goes Russ being an asshole again” or “that kid sucks and his parents suck because he’s sitting courtside which costs money so I hate him.” I think Russ did awesome and the kid is a kid that got too excited.
If anything, Russ is cool here to spend a moment with the kid even after initially being surprised. Watch the replay here (26 secs). The kid is standing cheering and Russ is falling out of bounds. Kid gets too excited (I think) and pats Russ too hard, which he can’t do. https://t.co/Q5Ytobsg0H

@PFTCommenter Most AWLs don’t know the difference between Veterans and Memorial Day anyway
The point of this tweet was to illustrate how much V-day sucks. The list 1-5 isn’t binding and omitted a few. Memorial Day and Cinco de Mayo make the top 5 for sure. Halloween gets less cool as you get older until you have kids who can enjoy it.

@ellesager @SageRosenfels18 I just don’t think discussing a hypothetical wishfully on twitter disqualifies anyone from being able to take a single action in 2020.
@MCouture87 Are you against people longingly discussing the hypothetical of more choice? Do you think doing so disqualifies those people from being able to take a single action in 2020?
@ellesager @SageRosenfels18 Here we go... can’t even talk about maybe one day having more than two without this lecturing....
@financejonE @SageRosenfels18 Why does this even need to be said?
@SageRosenfels18 I’d be ecstatic if we added another one. Anything but this. But get ready for angry dems telling you to FOCUS.

@CoombesMa @BigDuke50 @geoffschwartz Thanks a lot! We will see! Hope so. Why I have an issue with the culture being created... It’s misrepresentative of reality. And twitter can really perpetuate that.
@CoombesMa @BigDuke50 @geoffschwartz If that video wows a college coach, he shouldn’t be doing it.
@CoombesMa @BigDuke50 @geoffschwartz It has everything to do with these camps in underwear and the need for shit to go viral. If it’s a no bull rush drill, don’t misrepresent it for RTs. Lots of other ways for the kid to get his shine. If he’s as good as you say, he will. Do you not understand the issue?

Man on fire bros are always the most vocal. We get it. You think Man on Fire is a cult classic. It is not. It is a very well known movie. Some people like Flight (as well as other Denzel movies) better. In fact, there are a lot of possible answers. That’s what makes Denzel grt
What a great take. What an amazing movie. I mean... who would’ve thought that cold hearted, violent, loner of a man (with demons) would unexpectedly have a soft spot for that little girl and do whatever it took to exact revenge...
Hahahahaha man on fire hahaha lol lmao
Flight is my favorite Denzel flick
Hit the mini bar like Denzel in flight

@jemelehill DID U SEE THE MIKE CLIP ON GURLEY AND THE REFS 🤣🤣
@jemelehill I never think of it from a media perspective. I usually think of it from a timeline perspective. I think SAS is far enough on the “I actually take this guy seriously” spectrum (also more relevant nationally) that ppl are just more incredulous when he whiffs bad.
@jemelehill And btw CONGRATS on the engagement 🤟🏻
@jemelehill Maybe I’m unaware but I don’t feel like Mike is well liked on this site... I actually like SAS a lot.... Aside from the comp you make, I think maybe the mistake was innocuous (I think he’s stretched thin to watch a lot of 🏈?). If I’m Haskins I’d be like “are we doing this?”

Threatening violence against kids is wrong!! The left is not a monolith, so if you don’t like someone’s take (and there are some shitty ones), talk to that person. There ya go. No whataboutisms. Ppl who think the kids acted just fine will never be satisfied, but there ya go.
My takeaway remains that if you find yourself at the tail end of an indigenous people’s march in a hat that has come to symbolize something (this is a reality. Argue that you think it shouldn’t, but it’s a reality), you may want to keep a low profile.
The kids still behaved like ignorant, disrespectful, mocking children. The Israelites spewed some pretty hateful words, including homophobic slurs. Nathan Phillips approached the students. All these facts are not mutually exclusive. I don’t know why we struggle w this so much...
So yeah, here you go. My initial take was that these kids behaved like ignorant, disrespectful, mocking children. I was upset. I watched the two hour video on YouTube, and the longer clip...and here’s what I think now...
I’m getting a number of “what about the Covington thing now???” tweets. I get it, because I’m ABSOLUTELY guilty of sharing one of the first videos I saw that were available. Longer ones emerged over the next 48. more info still coming out. Watched the YouTube and longer clips..
@Mr_Bos1988 @ashyuille @PDeSant29Chiefs @geoffschwartz I’m saying that I think you’re absolutely wrong about how my pro career has gone, and it’s a bad comparison.
@Mr_Bos1988 @ashyuille @PDeSant29Chiefs @geoffschwartz This is a wild comparison. Have a good day!
@JakeBequette91 I tweeted 7 paragraphs at you and asked you what we disagree on. Let’s start there.
@phillyfirm @brookied820 Oh great stat just came out since you asked!! https://t.co/sPZfQjMYsI
@Alsboringtweets @M_Nichs I love drinking beer, but you’re missing the point intentionally it seems. I’d argue with you but it seems like the folks in your mentions explained it.
@phillyfirm @brookied820 I’m 34 in March. I’m third on your team in sacks, I’m top 5 in the league in QB hits. They gave me a raise last year. Allow me to humbly tell you to go away.
@phillyfirm @brookied820 Production says a hell of a lot better than 22nd, bud... but it pairs nicely with that with your “what about a shrine for Carson” take.
@geoffschwartz @Bcarp3 Very true
@geoffschwartz I’ve never been a big line up offsides guy, but you usually get warned once.
@Mr_Bos1988 @PDeSant29Chiefs @geoffschwartz Average player? You seem mad dude. Your team is doing great, just enjoy the Super Bowl.
@PDeSant29Chiefs @geoffschwartz I think it had to be reallly egregious to call without a warning, and I haven’t seen a straight sideline view. Most edge guys get more of a benefit of the doubt than interior guys.
@geoffschwartz You wonder if they warned him. That’s very rarely called. We always scream on the sideline when a dude has his head all the way offsides and refs kinda just look at you.
@JakeBequette91 Oh yeah, and Nathan Phillips approached those kids... not the other way around. I think there were definitely efforts to shorten the clip for maximum impact and that the kids still acted like pricks. The two conclusions are not mutually exclusive. How far off are we?
@JakeBequette91 Luckily, I never called for denying their college admission, for violence against them or for their identities to even be released. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. I am absolutely guilty of sharing one of the first videos I saw, and it definitely made me upset.
@JakeBequette91 Turns out the Israelite dudes were being assholes too. The kids remain ignorant and immature for mocking that dude. If ya find yourself in that hat (which whether you like it or not, has become symbolic) at the tail end of an indigenous ppls march, may wanna keep a low profile.
@JakeBequette91 Yeah bro. Watched the entire YouTube and the larger clip....

Haven’t gotten off the field on third and long in forever.
When is the third game
I know some people like the sound of silence in between their play by play, but come on @BarstoolBigCat everyone’s football IQ is skyrocketing.
Mahomes is smart as hell. Free play, took a shot, and pointed to the flag bc of the clock!
39 seconds is low key too much time nowadays.
Nightmare.
And btw, the tape was elite as always this year. 🤟🏻
Thanks bro. I have ADHD and a fully charged iPhone. https://t.co/qkCLSjxZKT
And they’re so afraid to be definitive in the booth for fear that the officials won’t agree.
He didn’t catch that ball. Wow.
I play aggressive if I’m KC.
Watching this game is bad for my health... and I thought I was safe on the couch.
Hill did a good job there.
@rd32_era Not enough to overturn. But close.
Wowww they blew that call!!!! Lmao!!!
@MFlowers59 https://t.co/LRMevSqCpR
Man that angle is way different.
What if the refs are in the booth checking twitter to see what would be the most agreeable call?
The league right now https://t.co/AYC5J1fy7p
@sod1102 And he was a pretty damn good player.
Wow. Game saving stop.
Tony Romo is awesome at this
@BKNetsNation51 As long as you agree that mocking that man was wrong. We seem to agree on that. Thanks for the convo.
@BKNetsNation51 I didn’t see it. It’s bullshit, and those kids are wrong. So now what?
@chad_rice Not sure. Hold up better inside, Pat has to know that the Pats will rush to his upfield shoulder at all times.
@geoffschwartz Are people this dumb?
@chad_rice Sacks like that?
Mahomes is bailing out the back of the pocket a lot.
@TheReal_RLS It happens to the best of us
@TheReal_RLS Sarcastic takes exposed !
Greg can hit from 65
Fowler just got paid.
@JimStill93 I thought the first down pass was a bad bad call.
@BrandonfrmNJ Haha no doubt
@Raphael1879 Nah I enjoy the site.
They’re 30th in the league in 4th down conversions FWIW. And that’s w a healthy #30. Not sure what I’d have done. https://t.co/quwLfPlgfH

Big play by Cam. Complete mismatch. No horse collar in the pocket if you’re screaming.
@AmyTrask @MGolicJR57 Hi!
@BIGN98 Very very true
@Micahochocinco @edsbs You seem weird
@kbizzle18 I actually think joe and Troy do a nice job, but they have to follow the ball.
One of my biggest pet peeves is people that watch games and only see someone making a difference if the announcers circle it or there’s a stat for it. It’s so common with pass rush.
Less than 2.5 seconds, beats a double team to a 9 yard drop target. Quick game will make ppl say “where’s the rush” “Where’s AD?” and this is what’s going on. https://t.co/IwsYwsrJGA

@Nbell3 @emh434 There are plenty of dishonest celebrities, media members and activists alike. No disagreement here (other than probably most of our politics). You sought out the wrong guy, I think. Have a good day.
@Nbell3 @emh434 Nah bro. I shared something without the proper context. I said that plainly. I never contended that they confronted him, or surrounded him. I never contended that they should be expelled, or denied college admission. The kids still mocked this man. It still makes me sick to see.
@emh434 I hope that they learn that those hats have grown to symbolize something, as well. I dislike intellectual dishonesty on my side of the fence as much as anyone. People can be guilty of that and these kids can still need to grow TF up. That’s as honest as I can be.
@emh434 I’m sharing the entire video in a bit. Definitely some deception going on, as usual. The context should be made available by anyone who shared the shorter clip. However, I maintain that they plainly mock him. I also maintain that if you play stupid games, you win stupid prizes.

@bbrooks_79 ✊🏻
@klzdad3 @realOCsports @geoffschwartz It was a gutsy gamble and it worked. The concept that fletch has to give zero movement on 3 dudes and make the play is interesting.
@realOCsports @geoffschwartz Lazy... ehhhh... defense stay is generally a deterrent on anything but 4th and &lt;1. And you have to worry about incurring a penalty (offsides, holding if you’re too physical w the guard transitioning to punt coverage.) Saints had THREE blockers on fletch. Ballsy call. Worked out.

@JustinTuck Clemson pounds the rock and wins the turnover battle. Clemson pass rush forces a costly turnover late. They win by 4. Man I’m good. I’ll delete this later probably.

@nosleeptilbed Am I related to the subject?
@nosleeptilbed Hahaha not endearingly either, I’m sure.
@nosleeptilbed I also saw it was trending today that Ed Sheeran was being ripped for wearing jeans and a t shirt to a concert. I remembered why I took a sabbatical from this app.
@nosleeptilbed I saw PETA say the eradication of these phrases was part of social justice and now I’m totally offended to be called an SJW

@MatanovicLaw I agree
Agreed. Once the conferences get tired of being left out (this year would’ve been a perfect storm), the pressure heightens. https://t.co/MIWKj7sP43
The quality of the game is superior in the NFL. But CFB can/should play to its strengths. CBB quality of play is far inferior to the NBA, and although I love the NBA playoffs, March Madness is my favorite thing in sports. https://t.co/sPjAjXxXZL
I like CFB&gt;NFL. It’s about volume/atmosphere/chaos to me. Expanding the playoff (to a point) would be cool. 1st round home field advantage, less inexact science. Power 5+3 or +1. As for OU/UGA, Vegas gives them a similar chance vs Bama. If UGA got in, you’d have 2/5 conf repped.

Focusing on mental health, root causes of violence in our inner cities, mass shootings in the suburbs and common sense gun reform are not mutually exclusive tasks. It’s all fucking relevant. Let’s stop leading the all universe team in this barbaric category.
Mass shooting today. Somewhere else next week probably. Audio made my stomach turn. If you’re callous or desensitized, bet you won’t be if you hear it. Over 9k people killed by guns in our country this yr. American exceptionalism... when it comes to this, absolutely. Depressing.

the #ThaiCaveRescue kids + their heroes should be honored on field @ halftime of the WC final, but I’m not sure they’d feel up to it. Bc this is twitter, I’m fully expecting a lecture on what the kids want and don’t want. I’ll imagine it being a really inspiring moment anyway.
Since solely eating chicken tenders at @applebees my physique has improved, the game is slowing down and my love life has improved. Every now and then I’ll mix in a vegetable, but I primarily live off of chicken tenders, just like our hunter gatherer ancestors. #teamtenders
Now it’s important to note that as a “method actor,” completing that @Applebees ad was arduous. I spent 36 days living in an Applebee’s, eating only chicken tenders. Every morning I’d emerge from the kitchen in a cloud of smoke and flex on the patrons. The tenders got me through.

Evidently some dude went and destroyed the Lebron mural for 300 dollars and I’m guessing he didn’t counter at all, which makes sense because he’d be just the type of guy that I’d imagine would do it.
@Sean_Lyric Evidently some dude went and did it 🤭
@DJFleming10 @Beau_Allen You don’t know who supports trump.
@McSantaClaus1 @Beau_Allen I can only do cash. If you have venmo, that’s great. Do you have a good visible location?
I might pay someone to put up a mural of @Beau_Allen in Philly.
@Justin_Kretch We can walk and chew gum. Right?
Incidentals like uber, lodging, mural destroying supplies/clothing + possibly airfare add up. Not to mention the legal risk assessment. The compensation package is just as bad as the concept of hating that the best athlete on the planet just showed up in town. Lakers fans wyd? https://t.co/JDIst9LIHD
@Justin_Kretch Which nullifies the gentleman’s cliche Chicago take, and reinforces the need for reexamining our gun laws all over the country. Thanks.
@dropnBos @4evrnyt @RussellOkung You missed the pretty obvious tone of the tweet. But no surprise.

@geoffschwartz Indeed
@zacharybest @4evrnyt @RussellOkung In fact, I’m not complaining at all. I’ve been one of the ones who’ve been extremely lucky. I don’t want any more money. Good play, largely good health and good luck have afforded me a decade long career of earnings at a high valued position. Not every player has that career.

I didn’t wake up wanting to argue about gun laws today. Just watch the video and be informed.
Nice goalpost move. “Law enforcement officials say 60 percent of the guns confiscated on the streets of Chicago come from Indiana, Wisconsin and Mississippi. The other 40 percent come from suburban Cook County and nearby suburbs” Unless... you don’t believe law enforcement. https://t.co/TVmrAuBPAE

@6Reichert I’ve always stood, and thank you for your perspective and service!! Enjoy the day.
@OffField_Mascot Love ya man- thank you!! Enjoy the day.
@JNigelRuhl Appreciate you!!!
@RealSlippy03 @4evrnyt @RussellOkung And someone had to negotiate those perks somewhere along the line. And that’s a good thing.
@nyg_will @4evrnyt @RussellOkung Yeah, someone would pay to see you play.
@2laneb @4evrnyt @RussellOkung Again, you’ve missed the point. Me saying “don’t ever complain about 30 dollars an hour because someone is making a dollar a day somewhere” is SARCASM, exhibiting how that line of thinking is dumb.
@Josethrac @4evrnyt @RussellOkung You’ve missed the entire point. Not shocking.
@SACowboyFan @4evrnyt @RussellOkung Negotiating a better CBA isn’t saying we don’t like our jobs or want to do something else. Believe me, if we wanted to, we could. You’ve missed the point.
@apmoser18 @4evrnyt @RussellOkung The point is... if you tried to negotiate a more favorable union situation and someone told you to stop complaining because someone somewhere is making less than you, it’d be dumb.
@apmoser18 @4evrnyt @RussellOkung Who said you don’t?
@ChadBommer @Diggs1414 @4evrnyt @RussellOkung @WaterboysORG I’m sorry, sir. I’m rich from playing football. Take your “economic anxiety” elsewhere.
@Diggs1414 @4evrnyt @RussellOkung Ha funny you mention that... check out @WaterboysORG ... As for attention- the Super Bowl sure helps!
@Diggs1414 @4evrnyt @RussellOkung And I’m not a carpenter! Keep it relevant, dork!
@S_Dub8 @4evrnyt @RussellOkung So stay out of it?

@Katie_marie02 When’s it’s done- y’all will know 👍🏻
@sandersism @4evrnyt @RussellOkung You too boss!
@sandersism @4evrnyt @RussellOkung Sure. Seems evident to me, though.
@sandersism @4evrnyt @RussellOkung And I’ll acknowledge I live better than 99% of the world and it is awesome, and I like my job and what it’s afforded me. I also know that as a labor force, we can push to improve it. Not everyone plays ten years in the league, walks away healthy or makes millions.
@TiltedSports @4evrnyt @RussellOkung You sound like the “if you don’t like America, leave” crowd.
@sandersism @4evrnyt @RussellOkung Long as he can acknowledge his siding w “white collar billionaires” further removed from middle USA, over guys who work a physical job for a handsome (capped, non guaranteed) salary. And he’s got to concede that literally most of the planet lives worse than the American carpenter
@4evrnyt @darmstrong17 @RussellOkung I wanna hear you say it, because you have to for your argument to be consistent... “middle America shouldn’t ever complain.”
@sandersism @4evrnyt @RussellOkung I definitely could see death rates being high. I’d still like to see TBI rates comparatively, but just because we’re here. Thanks for the measured convo.
@sandersism @4evrnyt @RussellOkung I don’t doubt it. And yeah, exponentially more dangerous + less fruitful in third world countries. I just will never understand “Everyman” proponents siding with the very people they resent (white collar billionaires) to spite (sometimes) millionaire players. I think I know why.
@4evrnyt @darmstrong17 @RussellOkung So should carpenters and middle America ever be able to complain?
@MontoyaAnigo @4evrnyt @RussellOkung Lol ok, champ. Refer to your own profile.
@4evrnyt @RussellOkung That’s certainly your right. Hope you keep it consistent and remind the complaining carpenter making 50k a year that the average worker in Sierra Leone making a dollar a day. I, for the record, think founded complaints are perfectly fine. Sorry you’re pro billionaire owner!
@MontoyaAnigo @4evrnyt @RussellOkung “And don’t even complain...” is sarcasm, inferred in context. But that’s difficult, I know.
@darmstrong17 @4evrnyt @RussellOkung And you make more in one year being a carpenter than a worker in the third world makes in a lifetime. The gross national income in Malawi (just a google click away) is $250. “Stop complaining” doesn’t sound so good.
@4evrnyt @RussellOkung The more concise point is that if a bunch of carpenters got online and complained and complained about some detail of their labor agreement, they’d have the right. Because someone is making exponentially less to do much more somewhere doesn’t nullify the discussion.
@4evrnyt @RussellOkung only illustrating that the “hey my life sucks compared to yours, so only I’m allowed to complain” crowd would be dealing with the same ppl IF THEY HAD THE INTERNET. Also, show me incidence of TBI for carpentry compared to FB...
@hbryant42 I know this is slightly off topic... but why is it always the deregulation, free market crowd that protects amateurism in college sports so vehemently?
@4evrnyt @RussellOkung The demand for football is why we don’t make 30 dollars an hour. And don’t ever complain about banging nails because some guy in the third world is working much harder for a dollar a day. (Additionally, I missed the CTE aspect of carpentry.)
