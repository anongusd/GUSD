I just voted AGAIN to pay @DHSgov employees during the shutdown. That includes our brave border patrol agents keeping us safe and protecting our border while going without pay. 214 Democrats voted no -- keeping them from getting a paycheck TODAY.
Today I voted to immediately pay federal government workers who have been impacted by the shutdown. 215 Democrats DID NOT vote to pay federal workers today. This is the second time Republicans have tried to pay federal employees, but Democrats did not and so the bills failed.
More caravans heading to our southern border because our laws incentivize people to traipse thousands of miles to illegally cross our border because of all the loopholes in our immigration system. We need to #SecureOurBorder. https://t.co/4Hz7elQwEi
