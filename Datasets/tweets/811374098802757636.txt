@SaysHummingbird I know this was not the answer you were looking for. Indirectly it is the motivation behind the President actions.
There are so many fixes; hence the conundrum (cracks, lopholes) to exploit. 		Sorry, I do not like endless tweets either. So much in this issue
When something not working chg the dynamics. A wall has not worked for 40 yrs, it won't work now. 	Take the power out of Washington &amp; give the authority to states could be the first step. Let the people have a say. What works for their State.
It would seem take away the lur( attraction ). Crack down on illegal activities ( support ) would be a great wall of defense. Its not the migrants fault! Its the situation that allows all side to exploit the tragedy. The complexity that makes it a great tool for POLITICIAN.
The complaint. They seem to have access to funds that citizen do not.	Finance, food subsidies, housing and medical support. Most done through false documents. Now there are companies financing some of this migration(Had an employee of one co. Admit it)
