I have two tickets to #SheWantsRevenge tonight at Rock and Roll hotel. Who wants them. First to ping me gets them.

Speaking of LinkedIn, I'd love to connect with everyone at #EUDAS2017. Here's my profile: https://t.co/WPc3GxY2qi
As we discuss digital advocacy at #EUDAS2017 there are thousands of Catalans outside the door doing old school advocacy. https://t.co/o0t7kKjyra
@HaroldTor Thanks for the reply. Did "pro-roaming" interests try to frame the debate with different language and phrases than those opposed to it?
@ktowens Exactly right @ktowens - which makes outreach to other "real" people outside the bubbles so important.
A question I would have liked to ask @HaroldTor: Did you look at language, not just French v English, but what words and phrases were used in different nodes of the network? Depending on how you feel about an issue usually defines how you talk about it.
I'm here representing the class of '93. ü¶Ö Once an eagle.... #EUDAS2017 @AmericanU @aubrussels https://t.co/E4wflhdzrX
Here's a funny example for people at #EUDAS2017 of an "influencer" in the home environment on the issue of about sugar in beverages:  https://t.co/u5S2njii5p
Lots of discussion of influencers at #EUDAS2017. In my experience it‚Äôs all about context. Working mothers usually have more influence than elected officials or insiders. You have to know your audience and the ‚Äúask‚Äù.

Going to start Tivo'ing Letterman as I need some fresh shows.
CNN says Obama wins.
At the DC Ward 4 Democrats meeting. Even with focus on Iowa all politics is still local.
I'm still sticking by my call of Edwards coming in 2nd. Hillary's people won't go with Obama as a back-up, and Obama's won't back Hillary.
I think Edwards will come in 2nd in Iowa tomorrow...as for first place, it's too close.
I'm booking a flight for New Hampshire
It's coooold today. Maybe not Iowa cold, but plenty cold enough.
