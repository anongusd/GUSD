.@NRLC State of Abortion states: “Abortion stops a beating heart more than 2,500 times a day.”  H.R. 490, the Heartbeat Protection Act, states that “if the Heartbeat is detected, the baby is protected.”  Let’s work together! https://t.co/iZwwLSagtN
The American People have a Right to enforcement of our laws &amp; a Right to a sealed border. Illegals have No Right to be here &amp; have ALL violated our laws. This #Amnesty deal negotiates away American Sovereignty.

Hang in there Mr. President @realDonaldTrump. If those countries aren’t as you described, Democrats should be happy to deport criminal aliens back to them. &amp;End #AnchorBabies, too.
America is in the middle of a DACA Amnesty debate today exactly because of the Amnesty Act of 1986. Amnesty begets amnesty. Rewearing law breakers begets more law breakers. It only ends when we say, “No amnesty, ever.”
On @FoxNews just now Juan Williams said, “There are lots of ‘white guys’ you know I’m thinking of Ann Coulter, Mark Levin, people...” @AnnCoulter, try as I might, I can’t see you as a white guy but maybe you have identified yourself and I missed the memo.
A most succinct #DACA analysis. https://t.co/50lYQ64uJw
A DACA Amnesty in exchange for a wall and enforcement would be the LAST deal of a Trump administration. Unless a second amnesty is served up to trade for more enforcement.  No civilized nation should be held hostage to amnesty as a requirement to secure its border.
National Right to Life @NRLC why are you NOT in full throated support of HR 490, the Heartbeat Protection Act?
HR 490, the Heartbeat Protection Act, has 170 cosponsors &amp; is ready for a floor vote on March for Life Day. Why are @NRLC &amp; @GOPLeader blocking it?
A baby with a heartbeat has a 95% chance of successful birth. That’s why, “If a heartbeat can be detected, the baby must be protected.” H.R. 490 The Heartbeat Protection Act of 2017.
Congress and President Trump cannot legalize DACAs without sacrificing the Rule of Law and broadcasting a call to come to America to be here for the next amnesty. No matter the “deal” the Rule of Law would fall!

@adamvanho Pre. ICE union testified under oath that he is prohibited by Obama from enforcing immig law even if in jail for other reasons.
@adamvanho RPI's are exempted from felony charges of document fraud in the #Gof8 bill. Citizens are not. That's true and now you know it.
#Immigration: Corker Amend is legalization now, border security never. Strategy only to "commence" b4 perpetual amnesty begins. Swiss cheese
#Gof8 You promise border security. How, when we can't secure Congress from Obama amnesty? Schumer, McCain, come guard my door.
20 brazen self professed illegal aliens have just invaded my DC office. Obama's lawless order gives them de facto immunity from U.S. law.
#Immigration: Senate votes cloture on amnesty act by #Gof8. Political inertia trumped common sense. Can the House salvage the Rule of Law?

Obama voters chose dependency over Liberty. Now establishment R's want citizenship for illegals. You can't beat Santa Claus with amnesty.
Romney just said, "We'll phase out subsidies once an industry's on it's feet." Wind PTC has a path to a soft landing.
Now that Hillary has fallen on her sword over Benghazi, who falls next after tonight's foreign policy debate, as a sacrifice to save Obama?
Romney had to debate Obama &amp; the moderator last night. Debate prep now requires new dimension. Moderators, leave misstatements to candidates
Biden telling the world that Iran doesn't have the nuclear material or a weapon to deliver it. If true, it's likely classified information.
Obama Administration's Benghazi after action report even to Congress was intentionally misleading. Will Obama push Hillary under the bus?

Declaration of Health Care Independence rolled out after Obama 	http://steveking.house.gov/_files/DeclarationofHealthCareIndependence.pdf
President Obama just told us that most of Healthcare negotiations took place on CSPAN and that he's a centrist and not an idealog.
Liberty is freedom bridaled by morality. A coyote has freedom.  Our Founding Fathers knew the difference.
After blaming Bush repeatedly, Obama then just said,"I'm not interested in litigating the past."
I'm on floor of the House ready for the state of the union speech. Probably hardest speech to write in memory. Nowhere to go.
2:30 PM today Press conf. The Declaration of Health Care Independence. What we, the People, are repelled by and what we will do. New rules.

My comments last night on the House floor on health care and Scott Brown: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1LtT17cihM #tcot #hcr
Scott Brown's acceptance speech is just over. Every minute in Mass well spent. No socialized medicine for America. Push the reset button.
I'm at the Coakley for Senate HQTRS in Andover, MA.  Not much activity for a U.S. Senate race.  Only one sign out front.
I'm here in Massachusetts with dozens of young volunteers who are now deploying to watch polls. Ready for "the Scott heard round the world!"
Hundreds of bright committed young people here in Boston for Brown. Here b\c White House & Congress will stick them with the healthcare bill
Brown Campaign here in Massachusetts has the feel of a last push presidential caucus run in Iowa.  Hundreds of people at Brown rallies.
Just spoke at Brown call center. 6000 calls from there. Coakley's callers are shut down. Meltdown
Even more pervasive than Brown supporters here in Boston is the snow. The worse the weather the better for the side with momentum - Brown.
On way to Mass to help Brown turn it red  .
