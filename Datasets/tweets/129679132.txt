@pitts_dave They will have to go through the same process as everyone else. 12 states including states like Utah have already passed this policy. It is not that controversial at all, and makes all states much safer.

Not in the weeds of this, but a quick google search implies 21 Savage is 26 yrs old, which if ICE is correct (which never take that to be fact) he would have entered US at around 13/14 years old. He‚Äôs a Dreamer. Raised in America. Shouldn‚Äôt be deported.	https://t.co/PIy7YKhgjZ

We have to push past the comfy. What's uncomfortable is actually solving things.That requires costs on both sides &amp; I don't believe in banking on the day Congress will magically solve this after injunctions fall apart. Make them fight to solve this, every day &amp; every opportunity.
People should negotiate. And people should negotiate from a place of actually accomplishing something - i.e. none of the poison pills &amp; a need to compromise. You can always walk away from the negotiations. But the concept of closing the door before having a conversation is sad.
It makes me quite sad that we've now entered a world where parsing through nearly 6 BILLION dollars of border security &amp; the perfect combo of provisions that allows everyone to exit with their rhetorical wins is where we're at as a country &amp; a Congress.
And act like a grown up independent branch of govt that actually cares about their constituents. Senate Republicans should try to actually govern &amp; put forth a compromise that keeps out legal immigration cuts, asylum cuts, &amp; ramp ups in interior enforcement...
Anyone who has tracked this for the last 2 years is fully aware, that if there were to be a deal, it needs to be something that actually gets 60 votes in the Senate &amp; 218 in the House. That's not rocket science &amp; that means Congress would have to stop being bullied by the WH.
Leaving behind over 1 million people whose lives have been disrupted greatly. Shouldn't fixing an actual crisis for them and their millions of US Citizen family members, employers, &amp; friends be prioritized? I get why "now's not the time" - But seriously, when will it ever be? 4/
It's particularly sad when it's so obvious that a majority of Americans are actually for a narrow bipartisan compromise on increasing security &amp; providing PERMANENT protections to #DACA recipients &amp; #TPS Holders. &amp; yet we find ourselves in an enforcement-only conversation 3/
Part of the challenge in these convos is that both sides are in rhetorical political battles not real policy ones &amp; so because each word could mean 29035 things depending on who is saying it the result is a bunch of fake conversations that result in nothing. And that is sad 2/

@CharlesJIsaacs I assume they‚Äôre doing the math of a fall hearing + a negative decision thereafter, but that‚Äôs not really accurate because DACA renewal apps take months to process and so if someone applies to renew a day before that decision it‚Äôs not a guarantee they‚Äôll ever see their renewal.
But the urgency and the threat to the program is still very live. And so to the hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients who have EAD expirations coming up over the next few months time is still very much so of the essence to get those apps in! Renew! Renew! Renew! /5
Have a concrete decision date backstop.	- Could come a couple/few months after.	- so basically today‚Äôs big win is we have a few more months to process renewals that could actually get approved on time. Things were going to be pretty tight 4 many if they‚Äôd taken the case today 4/
For DOJ to seek the court‚Äôs review. 	- however - and with the caveat that the SCOTUS can basically do as they please- it seems that all of these options IF the court granted cert would result in a Fall hearing (Octoberish)	- Decisions from fall hearings don‚Äôt exactly 3/
Become potential ‚Äútake the case‚Äù dates. 	- Those dates hit a culmination point in June when they make decisions on things before summer break.	- other intervening timeline elements include other DACA cases in other circuits, those rulings could give other procedural options 2/
Okay so here is some more procedural color:	- the next SCOTUS conference is 2/15 (this is the earliest next date a decision to take #DACA case could@come)	- Court could also relist it for another conference they have about 3 of those a month apparently, so basically all those 1/
RT @joseiswriting: If you have DACA, make sure to renew it! üëáüèΩ https://t.co/ZfnR7Nl15f
And just to be super particular the fall portion of this would be the hearing - they could still make the decision to take it up as soon as Feb 1/15
+ I *think* thousands of ICE agents and a 20% expansion of ICE detention beds.	https://t.co/sbjgT0vONK
@SituationCoach Yes that would just be a decision to take the case not to disrupt the current injunctions. Either way encourage folks to renew sooner rather than later to be safe!
I will say the 1 thing procedurally I‚Äôm not sure of yet is if the 4th or 5th circuits ruled and there was a conflict with the 9th what sort of expedited routes would exist but it seems that even in that world we‚Äôre still in October-ish land on #DACA &amp; SCOTUS.
Working understanding is that if the next time #SCOTUS reviews the Trump #DACA petition is not until 2/15, that even if they decide to take the case then there isn‚Äôt enough time for it to be briefed/heard this term, &amp; would move to fall. For #DACA recipients, every month matters.
I‚Äôm so happy right now.
News on #SCOTUS &amp; #DACA - petition was NOT GRANTED TODAY - this is not a denial of the petition but this at a min means that if the Court takes up the case it will not be until the fall. Huge victory to slow down the Admin‚Äôs plans to end what limited #DACA protections remain!

@Goose_Se7en @loondale This case is not on the constitutionality of DACA. Plenty of courts have already declared the program itself as constitutional.
Anyway I‚Äôll shut up now cuz I don‚Äôt even know if this makes sense anymore. Fin.
Me as someone who would normally embrace bipartisanship want folks to be eyes wide open that ‚ÄúDACA/Border‚Äù means 3846473 different things depending on whose saying it. I wish it were that simple and direct to fine tune on the edges, but it‚Äôs not. And it‚Äôs depressing lol. 9/
Hide behind the veneer of trying to be constitutional but not seem like the bad guys who harmed Dreamers. And then use the urgency once the court does their dirty work to get back to legal immigration cuts and asylum changes. That‚Äôs why... 8/
All the policies you see in Nielsen‚Äôs powerpoints, Trump‚Äôs letters to Congress, etc. it‚Äôs never actually about DACA. It‚Äôs about their dark desires to close off all elements of immigrating to the US. They want the Supreme Court to say their move on DACA was right so they can 7/
All of those efforts went no where (WH bills voted down) (WH kills bipartisan deals) - so then they went on an asylum enforcement rampage to manufacture a border crisis - family separation, caravan, remain in Mexico, tear gas etc. This has been to create an issue landscape for 6/
At every congressional negotiation over the last 2 yrs they‚Äôve acted like it‚Äôs the wall they want, but it‚Äôs not. As Dems called that bluff on multiple occasions w/ various forms of border security $. What they wanted was to change asylum, cut legal immigration 40% &amp; jail kids 5/
This Fri the Supreme Court meets in the morning to decide if they‚Äôll grant the Trump admin‚Äôs petition on the DACA case(s). Moral of the story is this admin likes to say they want to solve DACA but they‚Äôve been aggressively trying to HARM DACA recipients in the courts 4 16 mos 5/
That effort to bypass circuits failed as the 5th circuit case is still at the district court level. So then they decided to jump over the 9th &amp; petitioned to SCOTUS anyway (the 9th has since ruled, but there is no circuit court conflict) 3/
The Pres ended DACA in Sep of 2017, he did it in a passive way cuz DACA is remarkably successful &amp; popular. And then hid behind injunctions of multiple circuit courts that kept some pieces of the program in tact. But in reality his DOJ tried to hop over that in the 5th circuit 2/
I truly appreciate the non-political folks calling for a #DACA deal as a route out of the shutdown. It‚Äôs VITAL to understand that this admin actually wants that cover in a public convo to mask what they‚Äôre actually pushing which is gutting asylum &amp; putting migrant kids in jail 1/

Trump keeps saying the 9th Circ ruling interfered in #DACA negotiations. As a reminder, he killed the compromise bill &amp; had DHS essentially say it would cause a 2nd 9/11 the morning of the vote. HIS DOJ worked w/ TX to take down DACA in courts, HIS DOJ Petitioned the SCOTUS.
In the #RoseGarden right now Trump is essentially saying he is waiting for the SCOTUS to do his dirty work to throw 800,000 lives into disarray so that he can have a legal immigration cuts deal for DACA. How this is not challenged directly by these reporters is crazy.

@sneakerspg I think Stephen Miller "negotiates" in bad faith but rather transparently if you pay attention to it. If they fired him, there'd be a chance.
The audacity of this WH throwing a 5Billion dollar tantrum for two weeks to then spend time creating powerpoints for Dems to also give them the ability to jail children 2 weeks after kids died in their custody about sums up immigration negotiations of the last 2 years.

This letter from the President to Congress is not about #DACA, it's about saying they want indefinite detention of children 1-2 weeks after two small children died in their custody.	https://t.co/YKIrIpNyXm
Should add everything I said about WH &amp; DACA is from someone who works at an org that supported the USA Act &amp; Rounds King Amendment - both which had security $, &amp; took heat from the left for it. This isn‚Äôt about being an ideologue I want my friends &amp; staff protected.
RT @maggieNYT: Worth noting in the shutdown discussion - the administration continues to want to make changes to legal immigration/asylum.‚Ä¶
I'm not trying to be a downer, But the WH wants to get out of a hole to blame Ds. They're in a partisan, political gamesmanship fight, not an immigration negotiation. Staff comments are meaningless. I wish it was an immigration negotiation, but it's not. /4
People grossly underestimate how much Miller lives for this policy. He can talk in circles around everyone on it. It's *WHY* he's in the White House. &amp; why he's killed every good faith attempt at a compromise thus far. Just look at Nielsen's tweets of the last wk as well 3/
Not all staff in the White House are immigration literate. You could very well have someone on background *think* they're talking DACA/border, &amp; what's really happening is detention expansion for children. Reporters also feed into this because they also aren't in the weeds. 2/

Who Owns the Supreme Court? #DACA #ProtectDreamers https://t.co/VwqTWNz5ka
@EmawNation12 DOJ already moved to the Supreme Court to fast track things a few days ago just on the district court injunctions, so if anything this at least gives us a higher court's affirmation of the program when the Supreme Court looks things over.
@tonyherrera @AmericasVoice It does not. But it strengthens justification for the injunctions that have kept DACA renewals in place.
3 MORE judges rule in favor of #DACA. 	There's really no need to have this taken to SCOTUS. 	DACA is an incredibly successful program and disrupting the lives of hundreds of thousands of young people by removing their protections is unnecessary harm.	https://t.co/pxmfz9po33

@chasingchavez Potentially end of renewals being open by the injunctions, but I don't think we have a clear understanding of the disruption at that point. Ideally it would not impact the length of work authorization of those currently w/ it, but that those would be unable to renew once expires.
RT @jorgebaron: In case you needed a reminder of what's at stake tomorrow, here's what the @TheJusticeDept and @SecNielsen were busy doing‚Ä¶
Fin. As always happy to answer questions. Keep up to date at https://t.co/EI3g2BoNd3 &lt;3 /13
still an option that everyone who can does. And for those who know DACA recipients and love them to reach out and see if they need financial help to get their renewal applications in. Oh and also US Citizens: VOTE FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO WILL #PROTECTDREAMERS TOMORROW. 12/
So a way of thinking about today is that it starts the Supreme Court countdown clock. But as we know, DACA renewals take time to process, and there are tens of thousands of DACA recipients set to expire in the coming months so it is mission critical that while renewals are 11/
Then there's a hearing - you can expect that to happen sometime in the March-April time of 2019. And then they go into hiding and make decisions in mid/late June. It will be important for everyone to be loud about the consequences of repeal during this time. 10/
There is extensive briefing on both sides. This is an opportunity for influential stakeholders who can speak to the devastating impact removing protections from DACA recipients would have to put in legal paperwork before the court for them to consider. 9/
There's no telling if they'd grant it after that conference sometimes they table things, SCOTUS is a bit of a black box. But this just means whenever SCOTUS meets you can assume I'll be refreshing SCOTUSBlog for updates on their orders. Once they grant the case then... 8/
Grant or deny the petition. Becuz there is a conservative majority in the SCOTUS &amp; you only need 4 votes to grant cert, we are anticipating that this petition would be granted (although still hold out hope for a denial). We think the first date they'd have this conference is Jan4
They want SCOTUS to take this case *as soon as possible* and so this procedural move is an attempt to have these petitions reviewed in the very first opportunity SCOTUS has in 2019 - their first "conference" which is where they look over all the petitions submitted to them &amp; 6/
Well technically not 1 case, but one effort, where the legal questions are the same. It helps them expedite their timeline a bit as well. Why are they doing this now? Well for one, they're mean. But two, their meanness is driven by how the timing for SCOTUS to take cases works 5/
The Trump admin has essentially petitioned for all three of the cases that currently have injunctions keeping DACA renewals in tact. Those cases are in the 9th Circuit (pending decision), and the NY and DC District Courts. So this effort is to make it all one case. 4/
So what happened today is essentially the administration's follow through on their original threat letter to the 9th Circuit. During that period of time the 9th Circuit never ruled. What was a bit different that happened today that wasn't mentioned in their letter is that 3/
As you recall a couple weeks ago I was highlighting that DOJ issued a letter to the 9th circuit essentially saying "rule or we'll go to SCOTUS without your ruling on the 31st" - so we've been in wait n see mode since Halloween awaiting their filing. 2/

@chasingchavez No one's written about it yet - unfortunately election coverage is taking all the oxygen. This will result in the Supreme Court reviewing their petition probably around January 4th, and deciding to take the case (they only need 4 to agree to take it) and then a hearing in Mar/Apr
@Marco_OrneMend They will likely choose to take the case in early January (they'll meet on this likely Jan 4th) then they'd hear the case in the spring like March/April, decide in June. (at least this is first look analysis).
Today President Trump literally leap frogged over 3 federal circuit courts to go out of his way to disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands of #DACA recipients. They want the SCOTUS to be able to take status away from Dreamers sooner. Such a dark move a day before election day.

Things that are coming on immigration that Miller is using the caravan for that aren‚Äôt about the election:		- eradicating asylum	- family separation 2.0	- DACA takedown 	- shutdown over border wall		And a race for him to do this before his old boss is out of a job at DOJ.
It‚Äôs impossible trying to be a rational fact-based immigration person in a partisan fight where your issue is just the vehicle for partisan elites punching each other for points‚ÄîNone of who will show up to actually try to solve these things. It‚Äôs really annoying &amp; reckless.

@ZackBergerMDPhD Here's to November 7th....
Either way whatever CBP Says, &amp; however the #s are refuted. We know 5 year old Helen exists. We know it is common for parents of babies to come work in the US &amp; leave their children w/ grandparents. Quite possible there are more Helen's &amp; I sure hope someone figures it out. /10
So perhaps the math that Congress should be trying to figure out is: 6000 individuals - (Total individuals + their children in Ms. L class) the potential universe of children who *may* still be in UAC custody w/ either a released, deported, detained family member (like Helen) 9/
@DLind Helpful - so then is the math, 6000 individuals - (Total individuals + their children in Ms. L class) the potential universe of children who *may* still be in UAC custody with either a released, deported, detained family member and/or waiting on sponsorship approvals? (sorry lol)
Lifting up smartypants @DLind's feedback - that only confuses me more but perhaps makes me moderately less hysterical #FamiliesBelongTogether:	https://t.co/wJrxp4KhBY
@DLind individuals with a child? or literally individuals?
Here are some questions I have:	- Of the 6,000 family units separated during Zero Tolerance (which is probably way more children than 6,000 because some people arrive with more than 1 child), how many of those children remain in HHS Custody? #FamiliesBelongTogether 7/
So when this report says there are 136 kids still in custody and not reunited ---- that is SOLELY those children separated whose parents are within the lawsuit class. That does NOT include babies like Helen who were separated from their grandmas. #FamiliesBelongTogether 6/
Every week or so we get updates from the lawsuit - usually @jacobsoboroff tweets those in an easy to interpret example - here is where we last were on kids still separated vs. reunited vs. parents deported, etc. 5/ https://t.co/XsSt1jGNiw
Well yesterday, u may have seen this @stillsarita report in the @NewYorker about 5 yr old Helen who was told to sign away her rights and was separated from her Grandma (pls read to get human context) - Helen &amp; her grandma were NOT covered by the lawsuit 4/ https://t.co/iFGPqhXTvj
As we all know - the ONLY PRESSURED REUNIFICATIONS that have happened since zero-tolerance have been driven by the @ACLU's lawsuit against the government, but the "class" (as in the individuals eligible for relief from that lawsuit pressure) is limited to parents. 3/
Basically what this report tells us is that Amnesty got some numbers from Border Patrol that state that in the heightened period of family separation/zero tolerance 6 THOUSAND family units were separated. Why this # is significant &amp; scary follow below #FamiliesBelongTogether 2/ https://t.co/j8xXP0Db6v

Another way you can get loud #ForBlackMauritanians is to call your US Senators, and all of the house members in Ohio. Ohio is home to a large population of these individuals at risk.
Also we‚Äôve heard that all of the deportation flights are going through Morocco on @RAM_Maroc flights. Ask them to stop being complicit in deporting black Mauritanians into slavery!
So what can we do? My friends at @UndocuBlack &amp; @AmericasVoice tell me that 40 Mauritanians are currently detained in ICE detention centers and 100s have final orders of removal at risk of being detained soon. We need to help them! Pls help raise awareness #ForBlackMauritanians!
This makes them incredibly vulnerable and under risk of arrest and SLAVERY upon their return! Estimates are that 20% of Mauritanians are enslaved! We are literally deporting people into slavery or worse!  #ForBlackMauritanians
..living in the US, cuz they did not consider them to be Mauritanian citizens! Now cuz they‚Äôre scared of Trump they‚Äôre issuing a temporary thing but it still results in the black Mauritanians being undocumented when they‚Äôre back in their country of birth!
So this is where it reall gets messed up: An immigrant cannot be deported unless he has a legal travel document from the country he is being deported to. Under prior U.S. Admins, the Mauritanian govt refused to issue travel documents to Black Mauritanians
Because things are so bad for black Mauritanians and it would be dangerous to send them back, ICE put those without status under orders of supervision to stay here but check in with the govt regularly. Well, now we have a new ICE with new rules 3/
Mauritanians fled to the United States in the 90‚Äôs 00‚Äôs seeking asylum. Many were granted the ability to lawfully stay here due to the live-endangering risk of return, but many others missed the 1 year deadline due to not understanding our legal system, getting bad advice, etc 2/

Their game has been to shop the Texas lawsuit, create a conflict, and use the conflict to get up to SCOTUS as quickly as possible to try to end DACA renewals. And they will play off all the cases involved to try to create that...cuz they‚Äôre really mean. Happy to answer Qs. Renew.
So a couple weeks ago when the good news from this case came out and I said hold tight it‚Äôs gonna be a bumpy ride over the next few weeks this is one of the bumps. We anticipate another bump soon from TX, and God willing something positive from CA. No matter what just remember...
So they ask for a complete stay, but if they can‚Äôt get that they ask for it on the piece that would start the processing for the new applications. And then they say if you don‚Äôt do that give us 30 days. (I.e. after the current deadline they were under to start new apps Aug 23)...
Biggest takeaway is that the same person (Sessions) who spent Early summer trying to rip as many children from their parents is now spending the rest of his summer trying to harm DACA recipients and high schoolers raised in US aspiring to the DACA program. üò°
So what they want is a ‚Äústay‚Äù which is legalese for pause on implementation cuz they plan to appeal to the DC Court of Appeals (As in they‚Äôd like to move more quickly to try to deport Dreamers as quickly as they can and they don‚Äôt want to be bothered with helping high schoolers)
living without the fear of being deported, or accessing a driver's license or getting a job or going to college is more so against the public interest. In fact it's against 86% of the public's interest, but I'm just a layperson human.....anyway, the relief DOJ is asking for 4/

We have DACA protections in place from MULTIPLE courts &amp; reading the transcript of Judge Hanen last wk it's clear that they're trying to use the DC case to get the TX Judge to undermine the existing protections. They're pretty gross how mean it is at every step #ProtectDreamers
And a double reminder - the same people who crafted the family separation policy are the same people proactively trying to end DACA. Including the next R candidate for Gov in Kansas. Scary times: https://t.co/dkhphKnZzH
Reminder Judge Hanen held a hearing in the Gov's illegitimate suit w/ TX to proactively try to end #DACA last wk. Hanen asked 4 more briefings due today. Meaning anytime after today we can expect a bad decision. We can expect it becuz this was totally forum shopped 4 this result.
