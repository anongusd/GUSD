Fraction out of the media or 4x8/parade candy fund to get everything you need rather than going blind.
Polling or the magical digital spend, you can‚Äôt tell the difference anyway. The moral of my story is, research, good research is always worth paying a premium for. Early. There‚Äôs places to cut corners in campaign budgets, and we have all been there, but I‚Äôd rather take a little..
And by the time you get in the thick of media spending and narrative arc, everyone has forgotton you went for package B instead of package A from oppo firm. You just wrongly assume that you have the best hits against you and your opponent on your top lines sheet. Because like...
So these things get overlooked, because is it worth tens of thousands of dollars at the start? (Answer: Yes). Which leads me to the best irony. Campaigns will spend millions, sometimes tens of millions on direct voter contact (tv, digital, mail etc) pushing messages from these...
Go for a scaled down approach because early on in a campaign money is tight. And they think to themselves, so we really need to send someone to get the medical school yearbook. That‚Äôs if the oppo firm was even through to think of it.
Usually because the price is right.	Ask any real oppo digger, real research is tough, it‚Äôs time consuming and expensive. Very expensive. Often times requiring sending humans to courthouse, colleges, libraries, archives, hometowns etc. Candidates, consultants and managers often...
In my experience on campaigns, specifically major campaigns (think multi-million dollar efforts) where accomplished people (both your team and the others) are running candidates and old school general consultants hire a friend vs the best of the best to do vulnerability and oppo.

At the end of the day, better campaigns and better candidates win elections. #PA18 (6/6)
Congressional Republicans in addition to running better candidates and serious campaigns need to put their heads together and put real points on the board this year to prove that beyond just Tax Reform, there are reasons that Republican government is worth coming to vote. (5/6)
National Democrats won't allow many more Connor Lambs (Pro-Life, Pro-Gun, Anti-Pelosi) to their own detriment. (4/6)
Obviously, the house is in play this cycle. That being said, there are NOT many Democrats like Lamb. He ran a unique campaign that almost no Democrat on the ballot this fall can replicate. (3/6)
This is a very challenging environment for Republicans. We need serious candidates to run serious campaigns in order to be successful this November. (2/6)

@collinpace @clintbetts @mrice801 @Curtisut Correct away my friend! I figured you'd have some insight since you were on staff with the last guy who tried to buy #UT03.
@clintbetts @collinpace @mrice801 @Curtisut I'd send you some, but really you just need to go to https://t.co/zLwfS8e3lX to see that Tanner's father is trying to buy #UT03.

@bkostrzewski perhaps. Lets pick this thread up November 9th :)
@bkostrzewski true, fair, but the wrong question. Trump needs to drastically increase the vote share Romney got in 2012 to win. Possible?
@bkostrzewski just don't know how one can think he had an upward trajectory prior to the debate based on the (GOP) voters I've heard from.
@bkostrzewski you talked to actual voters recently?
@cwshevlin they came with an instructional VHS.
@cwshevlin I suspect phones/electronics were not allowed by secret service so thats probably the actual reason, but it did look like '96.
Why is everyone taking pictures with disposable cameras?
@bkostrzewski perhaps, but knowing Trump, he'll step on that in the next 12 hours rendering it useless.
Don't think this #debate changes the trajectory of the race.
