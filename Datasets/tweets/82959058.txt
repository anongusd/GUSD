Jane thanks the American Bar Association and President Bass for supporting the Law Library of Congress and its mission. Thank you for joining us for #LawDay.
Hilarie also says that with regard to the practice of law, technology will make us much more efficient and clients will demand that efficiency. Hilarie mentions outsourcing in document review as an example. #LawDay
Hilarie says that free online forms and other commercial providers are the tip of the iceberg for how law will change over the next 10 years to meet the demand of those who cannot afford a lawyer #LawDay
Jane asks Hilarie what the practice of law might look like in 10 years. Hilarie says it will look very different. First,  Hilarie says there is a huge justice gap, that 80% of Americans cannot afford a lawyer. #LawDay
Hilarie mentions ABA Legal Fact Check. She says they take a legal issue that has been in the news and provide non-partisan facts about that issue. #LawDay
Hilarie says she is focused on making the profession hospitable to diverse lawyers and transforming legal education to align it with what legal employers expect students to know when they graduate. #LawDay
Jane asks about Hilarie's time serving as the ABA President and asks her what she hopes her legacy will be.
Jane asks, what does separation of powers mean to the legal profession? Hilarie responds that the most important thing is supporting the independence of the judiciary by speaking out on its behalf. #LawDay
Hilarie says she is encouraged by the recent increase in engagement of younger people in American politics and their desire to participate in our democracy. #LawDay
Hilarie asks - how can you expect to maintain a democracy when 74% of citizens cannot identify the three branches of government? She says this issue underscores the importance of civics education. #LawDay
Jane asks Hilarie about the theme for #LawDay this year, “Separation of Powers: Framework for Freedom.” Hilarie emphasizes the need for civics education in making Americans aware of the importance of the separation of powers and the importance of an independent judiciary.
Hilarie says she is very passionate about studying how to make a legal career more attractive for women and minorities. With regard to women in the profession, she mentions that we start out with law school classes that are 50% female, but many leave the profession later on.
Hilarie says she enjoyed political science and enjoyed political philosophy during college. After college she pursued her passion as an actress, acting in a soap opera. After the show ended, she decided to  attend law school. #LawDay
Jane asks Hilarie how she became a lawyer. #LawDay
Jane recognizes Elissa Lichtenstein of the American Bar Association for her work in making today’s event happen and for her many years of service to the ABA Standing Committee on the Law Library. #LawDay
Law Librarian of Congress Jane Sánchez is welcoming everyone to the program. #LawDay
Law Librarian of Congress Jane Sánchez will interview Hilarie Bass about the separation of powers in the United States Constitution. #LawDay
Hilarie Bass is a Co-President of international law firm Greenberg Traurig and a prolific trial attorney with a highly successful 30-plus year career. #LawDay
We are pleased to have with us today Hilarie Bass, the president of the American Bar Association.
#LawDay is a national day to celebrate the rule of law and its contributions to the freedoms Americans enjoy.

Dean Schneider and Prof. Ravid will now take questions from the audience. #VeniceGhetto500
Roberta thanks Nathan Dorn, the Law Library's Rare Books Curator, for his work on this program. #VeniceGhetto500
Dean Schneider - An enduring mystery is that Shakespeare never mentions the Jewish Ghetto of Venice in the Merchant of Venice.
Dean Schneider is now discussing ways to vindicate Shylock and attack the judgment of the court in the Merchant of Venice. #VeniceGhetto500
Dean Schneider - Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice could be seen as a disguised criticism of English legal culture. #VeniceGhetto500
Dean Schneider - The Merchant of Venice has been rewritten many times, often to give Shylock a second chance. #VeniceGhetto500
Dean Schneider will discuss the Merchant of Venice. #VeniceGhetto500
Roberta is welcoming Dean Schneider to the podium. #VeniceGhetto500

Prof. Ravid - The ghetto determined the housing arrangements of the Jews in Venice, but it did not determine their culture. #VeniceGhetto500
Prof. Ravid - The ghetto was porous. During the day, Jews could leave the ghetto and Christians could enter. #VeniceGhetto500
Prof. Ravid - every Italian city, save one, had a ghetto. #VeniceGhetto500
Prof. Ravid- The Venetian Ghetto had three defining characteristics. It was compulsory, segregated, and enclosed. #VeniceGhetto500
Prof. Ravid is discussing the origin of the word "ghetto", which first appeared in Venice. #VeniceGhetto500
Prof. Ravid started researching the ghetto 40 years ago when he worked on his thesis on the Jewish merchants of Venice. #VeniceGhetto500
Roberta welcomes Prof. Ravid to the podium. #VeniceGhetto500
Ambassador Varricchio is discussing the Venetian Ghetto's place of importance as a center of arts and culture. #VeniceGhetto500

The Special Adviser to the Law Librarian of Congress, Roberta Shaffer is welcoming everyone. #VeniceGhetto500
The Ghetto is also the site where many early Hebrew books were first printed, including the Hebrew Bible and the Babylonian Talmud.
Today, the Jewish Ghetto of Venice is remembered as an important Italian center of Jewish life. #VeniceGhetto500
It ended when the French army conquered Venice and dissolved the Republic. #VeniceGhetto500
The legal requirement for Jews to live in this confined space was in existence until 1797. #VeniceGhetto500
The word is believed to derive from the Italian word, “gheto,” a term used for a walled quarter that had been the site of a metal works.
The site chosen for this segregated area came to be known as the “Ghetto”. #VeniceGhetto50
The wall separated them from the surrounding Catholic population. #VeniceGhetto500
On March 29, 1516, the Venetian Republic required Jews in Venice to reside within a walled area within the city. #VeniceGhetto500
In 2016, Dean Schneider arranged The Merchant of Venice as a mock trial that featured Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
Dick Schneider, associate dean for International Affairs and professor of Law at Wake Forest, will discuss The Merchant of Venice.
Prof. Ravid will discuss the European legal context that surrounded the walled district. #VeniceGhetto500
Benjamin Ravid, professor emeritus of Near Eastern &amp; Judaic Studies at Brandeis University will also be presenting. #VeniceGhetto500
His Excellency Armando Varricchio, Ambassador of Italy to the US, will provide introductory remarks on the history of the Venetian Ghetto.
We will offer a third commemorative program on the Venetian Ghetto in June. #VeniceGhetto500
It also discussed the experience of other non-Catholics in Italy in early modern Italy. #VeniceGhetto500
Our first program highlighted the work of Italian writer and chemist Primo Levi and Venetian Jews’ contributions to the arts and economy.

Thank you for joining us for Mr. Signer's book talk on Becoming Madison. #JamesMadison
Mr. Signer - Madison referred to the people as the ultimate authority. #JamesMadison
Mr. Signer - Madison's optimism &amp; belief in statesmanship carried the day, defeating the anti-federalist opposition to the constitution.
Mr. Signer - Madison pushed back against some measure of nihilism on the part of the anti-federalists. #JamesMadison
Mr. Signer - The climax of the book is the ratifying convention and the rivalry between Patrick Henry and #JamesMadison
Mr. Signer - Madison's opponents found his methods infuriating, inevitably dragging them to conclusions they did not want to make.
Mr. Signer - Madison's method of political advocacy employed many different arguments, rather than on focusing on finding a silver bullet.
Mr. Signer - One of Madison's methods of political advocacy focused on challenging ideas, not on attacking personalities.
Mr. Signer - Madison, contrary to popular perception, was not cold, calculating, and passionless. #JamesMadison
Mr. Signer is troubled by the lack of discussion about the importance of statesmanship in the modern day. #JamesMadison
Mr. Signer - Becoming Madison is an intellectual and psychological biography of a young #JamesMadison
Mr. Signer - The Federalist Papers explicitly addressed the challenge of the demagogue to democracy. #JamesMadison
Mr. Signer - the idea that demagogues will convert democracy into tyranny is grounded in the human condition itself. #JamesMadison
Mr. Signer is discussing the challenge of the demagogue to democracy. #JamesMadison
Mr. Signer - This view of statesmanship is relevant to the modern day where our democratic institutions and practices are facing challenges.
Mr. Signer - leaders should seek to educate and challenge the public to embrace longterm, complex policies. #JamesMadison
Mr. Signer - James Madison had many obstacles to his political success, not the least of which was he was shy. #JamesMadison
Mr. Signer is discussing Madison as an architect of statesmanship and his rivalry with Patrick Henry. #JamesMadison
