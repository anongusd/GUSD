An important point is being missed in the debate over the wall. The $5.7 billion that Trump wants for the wall would only build a small percentage of the wall, at most only about 20%, probably a lot less. A lot of the $5.7 billion goes for other border security items./1

@kausmickey Trump is incompetent, and he will never build the wall. Call for his resignation. Pence is competent, and will build the wall.
@maggieNYT If a wall/fences/ barriers are to be built, Trump will have to resign. He is incompetent, undisciplined, and is incapable of sticking to a strategy to do anything. Mike Pence is competent, and can build a wall/fences/barriers.
@ChrisCuomo Obama's EO got some coverage, but not the massive, ongoing coverage that Trump's scandals got. It was and is a huge threat to our Constitution. Obama should have been impeached for it.
@ChrisCuomo CNN &amp; and other media are right to go after Trump for his corruption, Russia, etc. But where were you when Congress wouldn't pass Obama's "Dreamers Act", &amp; he "passed it himself" by Executive Order (decree)? This was blatantly unconstitutional, a major scandal.

@realDonaldTrump Please resign! Mike Pence is way more competent than you are, and  can advance your agenda far better than you can anyway!
@ChrisCuomo Rex Tillerson, Reince Priebus, or others would do the country a great service if they publicly talked about how incompetent the President is. Most Repubs are unaware of this. 		The Pres should resign, and let the very competent Mike Pence (12 years in Congress) take his place.

@realDonaldTrump Trump is a part-time President. Won't learn the issues. Watches several hours of television a day.
@reasonedvoices @Evan_McMullin Having a competent President is by far the most important thing.
@reasonedvoices @Evan_McMullin Pence is competent. 12 years in Congress, including being in the Congressional leadership. Four years as Governor. That is the most important thing that we need, a competent President.
@Evan_McMullin Tillerson and McMaster owe it to the country to let the people know the truth. Could you help persuade any former WH staffers or Cabinet Secretaries to speak publicly?
@Evan_McMullin Tillerson and McMaster owe it to the country to let the public know the truth.
@Evan_McMullin Patriotic former White House staffers &amp; Cabinet members need to let the people know about the President's dangerous incompetence. Then the Republicans who still support him will know the truth. Then hopefully VP Mike Pence, who is competent, can be President.

@MMFlint Wrong. Fact check: The Vietnam War ended in a peace treaty in January 1973. The Democratic Congress lost the war by refusing to fund necessary bombing raids to stop treaty violations by North Vietnam in 1975.
