@gabewildau @FT There’s so much innuendo and insult. You don’t know me so don’t make assumptions. It’s sloppy and unfair and unprofessional. I write about concerns over Huawei because they are newsworthy and real. Why you defend them I don’t know.

@Sophiecat_luo @bluppfisk @DavidNakamura It's not a question of bribing me. It's about a conflict of interest. It's unethical to travel on the money of the organization you are writing about. 		And because Huawei is susceptible to the control of the CCP, America can't accept Huawei products and must protect itself.
@Sophiecat_luo @bluppfisk @DavidNakamura Don't you want a China that allows free speech without censorship and punishment? Don't you want the same freedoms that I have? I think you deserve that. I hope the CCP will give you that freedom someday or that the CCP will go away and Chinese people can be free of repression.
@DavidNakamura @Sophiecat_luo @bluppfisk More of a troll than a bot. But still trying to figure that out.
@Sophiecat_luo @bluppfisk @DavidNakamura Are you saying the Chinese Communist Party is like Voldemort, the most evil wizard? That's interesting. Why do you think the Chinese Communist Party is evil?

@Sophiecat_luo @bluppfisk @DavidNakamura I am not a China hater. I hope for freedom and democracy and human rights for the Chinese people, which is their universal right. My concerns are about the Chinese Communist Party and the companies that do its bidding.

@mtracey It's just that I think my sincere efforts to have substantive debate with you based on mutual respect are not being reciprocated, like you did the other day. So I'm going to disengage now and let's try again another time. Namaste.
@mtracey Now you are just making stuff up. Who said "cult lover" or "bigot." I don't care what religion she likes. I just care that she supports Assad, who committed and is committing the worst mass atrocities since the Holocaust. "Genocide denier" is largely accurate.
@mtracey That's a really unfair and disingenuous characterization of my argument, which we are debating in the other thread. I thought we were trying to have a respectful debate, but you veer from that to this.
@art_bax @mtracey @TulsiGabbard No, I was against it from before the invasion and to this day believe it was a strategic blunder and horrible human tragedy with long term consequences. Thanks for asking.
@biwah @JustinTLogan @TulsiGabbard That's just not how I feel. There's a middle ground between invasion and turning away in the face of mass atrocities. That's what I'm for. What are you for?
@mtracey @TulsiGabbard You are deflecting again. Straw man: Only "enemies" deserve our attention, action, etc. He is an enemy of humanity. In the Holocaust, for years we concluded Hitler was not "our" enemy, while he slaughtered innocents. We should have done more then. We should do more now.
@biwah @JustinTLogan @TulsiGabbard I hear you. I don't think humanitarianism is false. I think it is the essential element of being, well, human. I also think its an essential part of being American. But mostly its about being human.
@mtracey @TulsiGabbard Maybe it's more accurate to say you are both-sides-ing this and hard. Focus. If someone looks at systematic mass atrocities and concludes the perpetrator is on balance the best option, that's wrong. Morally wrong. Also, terrible policy (which is maybe where you and I disagree)
@biwah @JustinTLogan @TulsiGabbard Here you go sir. https://t.co/EwbipWgkSl
@mtracey @TulsiGabbard That’s a straw man argument, which is by definition a fallacy of logic. Tulsi can be morally bankrupt and some of those on the other side can be morally bankrupt too. But I tend to look to the Syrian people who have been tortured by the Assad regime for perspective.
@JustinTLogan @TulsiGabbard Perhaps you missed her regime led tour of Aleppo after Assad-Russian war crimes there, her public praise for those war crimes, her repeated efforts to cast doubt on chemical weapons attacks by the regime, her voting against legislation pushing accountability for war crimes, etc
Being Hindu, Hawaiian or a veteran is no excuse for whitewashing the worst systematic mass atrocities since the Holocaust, which are still ongoing now in Assad’s dungeons. It’s not about labels. It’s about @TulsiGabbard lacking the moral clarity to represent America. https://t.co/crDP1AwrVs

@mtracey @YossiGestetner OK, I'm happy to call this exchange constructive and I appreciate your thoughtful engagement. I take your point that we can't know the IC's true motivations and in fact they may be varied. I'll definitely think about that more when I talk about this next time.
@mtracey @YossiGestetner Take me at my word I am engaged in an honest effort to seek information and do informed analysis (and yes opinion), that I'm not motivated by a desire to promote any bureaucracy (certainly not the IC) &amp; then we can have a real debate that's worthy of our reader's time &amp; attention
@mtracey @YossiGestetner But me pointing out that (based on reporting, evidence, data) the IC is correct that ISIS is not defeated and Little Kim will likely not going to give up his nukes doesn't mean I'm spinning for them. There are many things I have criticized the IC for, including torture. 2/3
@mtracey @YossiGestetner You are so caught up in smearing me and defending your smear, it obscures your otherwise intellectually interesting arguments. If you believe Trump more than the IC on ISIS and North Korea, go for it! I disagree with you, and that's OK. 1/2
@YossiGestetner @mtracey Hey Yossi, here's the tape. Feel free to make your own judgment. I'm confident you will see @mtracey did me dirty. But it's not a big deal. He's passionate in his beliefs. I respect that. I just wish he would be more intellectually honest. https://t.co/Hnntwlx2nZ

@mtracey @YossiGestetner "Josh Rogin of WashPost is on CNN expressing thanks." Come on brother, own your mistake since you always tell others to own theirs. Anyway, it doesn't matter, if you really wanted to know what I think you would have asked, not speculated incorrectly.
@YossiGestetner @mtracey Yeah, more like he went out of his way to attribute a motivation to me to attack me, which is totally unnecessary, because I'm happy to debate the points on their merit with him, just wish he didn't have to misrepresent my views to do it.
@mtracey Jeez man, you don't have to mischaracterize my points to criticize me, just criticize my points. THANKS for admitting I never said "thanks." cc: @YossiGestetner
@YossiGestetner @mtracey I didn't "thank" anyone. But sometimes people quote tweet trolls and regurgitate their inaccuracies. I forgive you. Namaste.

@EliLake @ChuckRossDC The treatment of Podesta and Mercury is totally consistent. Manafort is a completely different situation. Are you saying those who cooperate and those who lie to the FBI should be treated the same? That’s seems nonsensical. Chuck said it was political.
@EliLake @ChuckRossDC Your implication that the law is not being applied consistently still fails to address that Podesta and Mercury are likely cooperating. Their treatment is obviously non-political because the Mercury guys are Republican and they got the same treatment. So your allegation is false.
@ChuckRossDC @EliLake I agree 100% all unregistered foreign agents should get what’s coming to them. And, I think the ones who commit more crimes and also lie to the FBI should get worse. By the way, do you think Corey L is an unregistered foreign agent right now?
@ChuckRossDC @EliLake Also, to buy into the false equivalence you and Eli are suggesting, one would have to ignore that Manafort’s involvement with Yanokovich was way more than the others, including embezzlement and tax fraud allegedly. Again if is purely political how do you explain Mercury?
@ChuckRossDC @EliLake There was an investigation before the election into Russian interference &amp; links to the Trump campaign, so the premise of your question is misleading. Nobody thinks John Podesta worked with Moscow. But (Tony) Podesta and Mercury might still cooperate and Manafort might still lie.
@EliLake I guess some of them are cooperating with law enforcement and some of them are lying to the FBI and working with the campaign to try to undermine the investigation.

@ericviola_ The Jesus-Hilter analogy is the textbook example of false equivalence because it is the most extreme example. It's the way they teach you how to understand false equivalence. It's understood not all examples are that clear cut. But I see what you did there.
@ericviola_ I was giving one more example of a false equivalency to illustrate my point.
@marcsingertweet @ggreenwald My original tweet addressed it. I don't think American billionaires fit the definition. "Elements of oligarchy" perhaps. Russian billionaires must pledge corrupt fealty to Putin (or suffer) and perpetrate a conspiracy to commit crimes against Russians and us. That's an Oligarchy.
@ggreenwald 2/2 It's a fallacy of logic. Jesus Christ and Adolf Hitler both have mustaches, but they are not the same. The value judgments are a separate issue. I'm not offended by your logical error, or even by your ad hominem attack. I engage you in the spirit of mutual respect.
@ggreenwald The study you point to doesn't say the U.S. in an oligarchy, just a headline on a BBC article. It says data supports theories of "Economic-Elite Domination" or "Biased Pluralism." But my actual point is that you are drawing a false equivalence. 1/2 https://t.co/LcYu2ied5b

@TonyCartalucci @Navsteva @604yousuf @jrezaian Hey Tony, I'm trying to say you made a fair point, that we can''t know 100 percent what happened, but Jason did not make a mistake. He has good sources and is not peddling "propaganda" He also made clear that we need the regime to tell us more.
@TonyCartalucci @Navsteva @604yousuf @jrezaian 2/2 I take and credit your point (honestly) that we don't know the specifics of Layla's death. I'd like to know much more. We should not jump to conclusions. Thank you for that caution. But the regime is responsible for her death, in their custody.
@TonyCartalucci @Navsteva @604yousuf @jrezaian I disagree with you on your assertion the FBI can't verify the photos unless they examine the scene. There's also the corroborating evidence of witnesses, etc. Assad is a mass murderer.  1/2
@TonyCartalucci @Navsteva @604yousuf @jrezaian It's not correct to say the FBI can't evaluate evidence (especially so much evidence) without actually stepping into the torture chambers Assad's regime used. It's a straw man argument.		As for the circumstances of her death, it's simply not plausible she died of natural causes.
@TonyCartalucci @Navsteva @604yousuf @jrezaian The FBI did extensive analysis of the Caesar photos are publicly declared their verification. https://t.co/rkzKZ7irR1 		Again, please don't ascribe motives to me. It's not fair. It's not nice. You will feel better when you alleviate your suffering by releasing your anger.
@TonyCartalucci @Navsteva @604yousuf @jrezaian And I sincerely am not being condescending. I truly believe in the need for more kindness, tolerance, mutual respect and compassion in our politics and our debates. It's not a tactic. It's a healthier and happier way of being.
@TonyCartalucci @Navsteva @604yousuf @jrezaian There is overwhelming amounts of verified evidence that the Assad regime has tortured and murdered thousands of civilians in custody. https://t.co/OpjaPI2utj These are only some of the Assad regime's mass atrocities and crimes against humanity.
@TonyCartalucci @Navsteva @604yousuf @jrezaian I disagree strongly with Nav, but he is not making ad hominem attacks or accusing me of things that aren't true. I seek online interactions based on mutual respect and kindness. If you agree, we can try to tamp down some of the anger on the internet together.
@TonyCartalucci @Navsteva @604yousuf @jrezaian That's not a constructive comment. I encourage you to follow the path of kindness and mutual respect. I wish you the best.
@Navsteva @604yousuf @jrezaian I know Jason. He's not a spy. He's a journalist. Wrongly imprisoning him was a crime. Sovereign governments are capable of and often commit crimes. It's hurtful &amp; wrong to hold up that sham process as having any credibility. In a world where that is the standard we are all lost.
@Navsteva @604yousuf @jrezaian How about a first name? It's odd debating someone who insists on being anonymous. They arrested her.  They admitted she died in their custody (two years later). They are responsible for her death. Jason was falsely accused by the Iranian regime and "convicted" after a sham trial.
@Navsteva @604yousuf @jrezaian Not at all. I engage you in the spirit of mutual respect, compassion, tolerance and the essential oneness of humanity. I just like to know who I am talking to. What's your name?
It's intellectually dishonest or lazy to argue Flynn should skate due to FBI interview details because we can't know the other parameters of his deal.

More Bolton: "The United States looks forward to watching each corner of the triangle fall: in Havana, in Caracas, in Managua... Look to the North; look to our flag; look to your own. The Troika will crumble."
“... This Troika of Tyranny, this triangle of terror stretching from Havana to Caracas to Managua, is the cause of immense human suffering, the impetus of enormous regional instability, and the genesis of a sordid cradle of communism in the Western Hemisphere.”
“In Venezuela and Nicaragua, desperate autocratic leaders, hell-bent on maintaining their grip on power, have joined their Cuban counterparts in the same oppressive behavior of unjust imprisonment, torture, and murder...”
“Under this administration, we will no longer appease dictators and despots near our shores in this Hemisphere,” Bolton will say.
Today in Miami, John Bolton will announce a new policy toward Latin America to confront the governments of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, calling them the “Troika of Tyranny.”

@dick_bray @KellyannePolls @MeetThePress Ah, now we are having a serious discussion. If we can agree that the Syrian people should not be submitted to mass atrocities, then we can have a real talk about what we can or should do about it. It's a tough problem, but we have a lot of options.
@jimsciutto @KellyannePolls @MeetThePress %100 agree. That's why its so sinister to use them to make people here feel good while actually implementing policies that enable so much human suffering over there.
@jimsciutto @KellyannePolls @MeetThePress My view is that the airstrikes were pinprick alibis so people like Conway can claim we have a strong Syria policy when the president has been withdrawing and cutting off resources this whole time.
@dick_bray @KellyannePolls @MeetThePress I am advocating for the people of Syria being treated with dignity and granted the basic universal human rights that you and I enjoy. It's as simple as that.
Watching @KellyannePolls brag about Trump's airstrikes in Syria while this administration stands by and watches the coming slaughter in Idlib is surreal and so depressing. @MeetThePress

@PhilippeReines I am not writing a column on this. I am not demanding responses from anyone. Also, I am not irresponsibly speculating in a way that could harm people's reputations &amp; careers. I hope you decide to refrain from that as well. I'm ending this interaction but I wish you only the best.
@PhilippeReines And you know it's not about tone. Be as tonal as you feel. The issue is you floating names of people you know the vast majority of didn't do it. You are better than that, or at least you used to be. It's not a partisan criticism, it's a human one.
@PhilippeReines When I covered Secretary Clinton, I was a news reporter. Now, 9 years later, I'm an opinion columnist. I know you know the difference. But to answer your question, I didn't publicly accuse anyone of betraying her without evidence. You would have freaked out. Be consistent.
@PhilippeReines I'm an opinion columnist. Calling out public figures (like you) for bad behavior is precisely my job. 		Now when you go to an ad hominem attack, that's the Philippe I recognize for sure. #BeBest I think we still do get along well.
@PhilippeReines I’m 100% sure at least all but one of the people you are naming didn’t do it. You’ve let your partisanship cloud your judgment. The government is full of patriotic Americans serving their country. They don’t deserve your targeting.
@PhilippeReines LOL. Even you didn’t speculate about Jofi publicly before you were sure. Also, that story had some important flaws and omissions. Seriously, try not to draw suspicion to innocent people. It’s not cool.

Gen. Dunford says he doesn't have "high confidence" in reports there are 30,000 to 40,000 ISIS fighters in Iraq &amp; Syria but doesn't give a different number.

"Facts are stubborn things, my friends."
Quoting Mao (usually without credit): "It's always darkest before it goes completely black."
“Udall ran for president from Arizona and lost. Goldwater ran for president from Arizona and lost. I ran for president from Arizona and lost. Arizona is the only state in the union where parents don’t tell their children they can grow up one day to be president."
Quoting Mo Udall: “What’s the difference between a caucus and a cactus? With a cactus, the pricks are on the outside.”
“What’s the difference between a catfish and a lawyer? One is a scum sucking bottom feeder… and the other one is a catfish.”
“It’s so dry in Arizona, the trees chase the dogs.”
Here are my favorite John McCain sayings:		“After I lost the 2008 presidential election, I slept like a baby… sleep for two hours, wake up and cry, sleep for two hours, wake up and cry.”		1/?

.@SenatorMenendez gets mad when Pompeo accuses him of playing politics. "If President Obama did what President Trump did in Helsinki, I'd be peeling you off the ceiling." Corker asks Pompeo for a response. Pompeo says, "Not a word."
Pompeo endorses new sanctions on Russia, to raise the cost on Putin, says they should "impact the Russian economy." Important.
Portman jokes to Pompeo: "I think they (the WH) wait until you are gone before they make these decisions." heh
Pompeo just confirmed that Trump and Putin discussed Israeli security in relation to Syria. Here are all the details of that: https://t.co/3NF550AG9W
Pompeo accused Menendez of playing a game by asking basic questions about what happened in the Trump-Putin meeting. Menendez clapped back.
Pompeo says, “We are engaged in patient diplomacy” with North Korea. That’s a change from the push to make sure Kim doesn’t drag it out to exert concessions and wiggle out of sanctions.
Turkey has released American Pastor Andrew Brunson from jail, Pompeo says, but is still under “house arrest” in Turkey.
.@TomCottonAR calls the Chinese Communist Party’s effort to force airlines to pretend Taiwan doesn’t exist “pathetic” and the cave of U.S. airlines disappointing. “These demands are the mark of insecure, impotent leaders who know the future will not belong to them.”

@ScottAdamsSays Also your point on the Trump statement is also wrong. I didn’t speculate on Trump’s motives (sure, perhaps he was joking). I simply pointed out the Russians acted on his statement and probed Hilllarys server the same day.
@ScottAdamsSays You didn’t ever bother to do your research before publicly attacking me. How is that fair? For that, I’m owed an apology.
@ScottAdamsSays Don’t back away from it now. You started by saying my tweets shows that anti-Trumpers are backing away from the collusion accusation. But I’m not anti-Trump and I’ve never written one word accusing him of collusion, ever. 1/2
Scott Adams says on his podcast I'm moving goal posts by saying Trump promoting Russian attacks on democracy is bad. No. Trump promoted the Russian attack and his allies communicated with the attackers and spread the stolen material. That's a permanent goalpost. It's always bad. https://t.co/324ebnKZsC

@DanielLMcAdams You are missing or ignoring my entire point. Collusion is not the issue. Team Trump encouraged and promoted an ongoing attack on our country. They don’t need to have colluded to have acted terribly.
@aafmuller @polidominum It’s in the indictment. Read it. Learn.
@Bershidsky I apologize. I disagree with you but don’t wish to be disagreeable.
@bradynichols85 You are blocked. Goodbye forever.
@Bershidsky I was being polite.
@polidominum @aafmuller Russians didn’t take it as a joke. They acted on his suggestion.
@aafmuller There is a ton of evidence Trump encouraged the attacks and promoted the stolen material. Denying that is absurd.
