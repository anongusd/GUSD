@StaceyLovesWeed @jdewitt70 @dwaynejcrawford @crybaby_studio @anylaurie16 LOL SHE HAS BEEN A MEMBER OF SAG FOR 15 YEARS. Comics threatened by Stormy doing stand up are sadsacks grasping for any way to explain to themselves why they are failures. Getting gigs isn't a reward for time spent doing stand up or being a "female comic" either. Try being funny.
@jdewitt70 @dwaynejcrawford @crybaby_studio @StaceyLovesWeed @anylaurie16 Also Stormy IS an actual writer and comedian working to make it. This whole line of thinking is bullshit. People are allowed explore new creative endeavors. Forget Laurie Whoeverthefuck. Now I can go back to having never heard of her.
@anylaurie16 Stormy IS an actual female comic, dumbass. Instead of tearing other comics, at whatever stage in their comedy careers, down, why don't you try being funny for once. It'll do a lot more for your fledgling career than demanding gigs you can't get on your own merits.

@LorenaSGonzalez @mcpholder @StormyDaniels @sdut @LorenaAD80 @MichaelSmolens Your tweets to Stormy Daniels and attacks on her op ed betray astounding ignorance. Yeah, I'm angry. It's maddening that you are moving forward with so little actual understanding of how your bill will impact normal people.
@LorenaSGonzalez @mcpholder @StormyDaniels @sdut @LorenaAD80 @MichaelSmolens I don't doubt that your intent is to help working people. But clearly all you've done is listen to the professional activist community rather than seek out info from regular people. Abandon your ego. Ask and listen with an open mind. Think creatively. There's a better way.
@LorenaSGonzalez @mcpholder @StormyDaniels @sdut @LorenaAD80 @MichaelSmolens Call the Author's Guild, Lorena. https://t.co/rdROeCEDP0.		Yes the ABC test is law regardless. But the court doesn't exist to make law, you do. You could sponsor a bill that looks out for all workers, decouple benefits like health insurance from employment, etc.
@LorenaSGonzalez @mcpholder @StormyDaniels @sdut @LorenaAD80 @MichaelSmolens Wait are you disavowing your own bill? That's HILARIOUS. The fact that you havent heard complaint from a single journalist is evidence that you haven't sought feedback with open ears, didn't do your homework, and your skin is too thin to admit now that you screwed up.
@LorenaSGonzalez @StormyDaniels @sdut @LorenaAD80 @MichaelSmolens Your bill will hurt whole industries. But your ego is too invested for you to step back and ask if maybe there's a better way. If you actually cared about workers you would improve conditions for all, including contractors. But you're just another sad sack politician. Screw you.
@mcpholder @LorenaSGonzalez @StormyDaniels @sdut @LorenaAD80 @MichaelSmolens She's "just trying to help" and ignorantly hurting entire industries while lacking the humility to ask how she might mitigate harm, and question if maybe there's a different way to get to the same result.
@StormyDaniels @sdut @LorenaAD80 @MichaelSmolens Reuters no longer hires freelance writers in CA because of #Dynamex. Gonzalez's bill is an unimaginative, ham-fisted attempt to regulate a 21st century economy with 20th century policy. We don't need an entire economy of employees we need a better deal for ALL contractors.
@bayofarizona @StormyDaniels @sdut @LorenaAD80 @MichaelSmolens Dynamex is screwing over freelance writers as well. Hairdressers in Washington are getting screwed over similar policy change. We don't need an entire economy of employees, we need a better deal for freelancers.
All journalists reporting on the #Dynamex ruling in CA‚Äîit's not just strippers. Freelancers (increasingly the backbone of YOUR industry) are hurt by the ruling as well. We don't need employee status, we need a better deal for contractors. https://t.co/rdROeCEDP0

@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump I don't even know what zing means lol. Nothing personal. Just saying no one is going to jail for saying they are wealthier than they are in a campaign (not clear what felony you're talking about....). Why not focus on the many crimes of the Trump family that are actual crimes?
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump Well yes, that is true. But you're talking about him lying about how rich he was. Something like that is just never going to stick. It's newsworthy. But it's silly to suggest he committed fraud by lying about his wealth. He is guilty of plenty else.
@PalmerReport @realDonaldTrump There zero chance any politician's campaign lies would qualify as actionable fraud. That is insane. It's.stupid.
@MichaelAvenatti I'm all in favor of a lifetime ban on anyone who serves in the senate ever running for president (except, I guess, the VP). Would elevate the chamber and restrain the executive, and Warren could continue her admirable service without even thinking about running. She'll lose. Bad.

@grumpy_grum @StormyDaniels Copy that. Maybe I expected too much. I was just floored by the willingness of this alleged journalist to completely make shit up. Will try just looking away.
@davidbyatt @StormyDaniels @channel5_tv @bbuk It'll come out in due course. Hind's account is completely fabricated though. I get making mistakes. I've certainly gotten it wrong myself before. But this story is the work of a fabulist and its author should be laughed out of the profession.

Either way, @katiehind, you're a disgrace to our industry. I've been sitting back watching nearly the entire UK press get the Stormy story horribly wrong for days. But you and your colleagues at your trash bag tabloid have taken the cake.
I, @katiehind, was there for the entire #CBB row with @StormyDaniels, and I can tell you with 100 percent certainty that your "coverage" of the situation is beyond flawed. You've either simply made shit up out of whole cloth or quoted unreputable sources and reprinted their lies
Hi @KatieHind. What kind of trash bag person can sleep at night after spending their days writing for The Daily Mail? You're a fabulist and a shit one at that.
I'm a journalist who has been traveling with @StormyDaniels reporting on her life, witnessed the whole Celebrity Big Brother thing, and I have to say that the mendacity of @channel5_tv and @bbuk is quite something. What staggering cowardice. #CBB
