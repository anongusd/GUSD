Patrick Swayze dies of cancer at age 57.
Looks like Scott Brown is going to be the only Republican that will be running for Senate in Massachusetts.  Where are the other candidates?
Ok, Curt Schilling running for Senator would be an interesting choice, but since he's unenrolled, who will the GOP actually find to run?
Thank God for three day weekends!  Dying to see if the MassGOP can come up with a Senate contender for seat left open by Ted Kennedy.
Now that we have an open Senate seat, will our legislature change the law to benefit their party?  You betcha.
Waiting to see if MassGOP can actually find someone to groom to run for the U.S. Senate.  I wouldn't bet on them based on their track record
I wasn't a fan of Ted Kennedy, but unlike some people I know, I'm not reveling in his death.  That's just wrong/stupid. I don't get people.
When is the GOP going to start doing something in this state? MassGOP gets excited now when someone protests outside. big damn deal.

Being a Republican in MA sucks w/ our "leadership" at MassGOP...they hire a bunch of idiot kids to run it. A Republican for common sense!
