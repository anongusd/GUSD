Shutdown. The word this tweet was looking for at the end was "shutdown". You can point and laugh now.
Stacey Abrams, the party's pick to rebut President Donald Trump's State of the Union speech, slammed the commander-in-chief for causing the partial government. #sotu  https://t.co/NzfyCidDFJ
Abrams said President Barack Obama understood the need to show "compassionate treatment" to immigrants, yet his record-setting deportations earned him the moniker of "deporter-in-chief".	https://t.co/RT2urEhUY7
Stacey Abrams said Americans "owe more" to certain workers including "truck drivers forced to buy their own rigs." A 2017 USA TODAY investigation revealed how port trucking companies leave the drivers broke. https://t.co/F6EqboCfRy
Trump's #sotu was among the longest ever spoken. Former President Bill Clinton spent the longest previous to speak at nearly an hour and 29 minutes in 2000. Trump spoke for nearly an hour and 23 minutes.
President Donald Trump used his second State of the Union address on Tuesday to push the familiar themes of his administration. https://t.co/QXXMl7ntxn

Trump introduced Timothy Matson, who was one of the Pittsburgh Police Department officers who responded to the mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue that claimed 11 lives. #SOTU https://t.co/6urlOuxyL7
Trump said his decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement would ensure “this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons.” But Iran’s compliance with that agreement, despite the U.S. withdrawal, is what’s keeping Iran pursuing a nuclear weapon - for now.
Trump said ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria when he took office and that virtually all that territory has now been liberated. The extremist group still commands thousands of fighters and has a broad network of supporters around the world.
Trump said the U.S. has spent more than $7 trillion in fighting wars in the Middle East. He did not say what time period that figure covers. A 2018 Politifact analysis concluded the U.S. had spent closer to $2 trillion on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  https://t.co/rDyYQwwV3E
Trump said he wants to commit to eliminating HIV in the U.S. within 10 years. But critics say his stance doesn't square with his previous efforts to roll back health care and cut AIDS research. https://t.co/vNcHUaKLpt
Miles of Vietnam-era landing mats were erected in the 1990s. That, along with beefed-up enforcement, reduced the flow of undocumented migrants. Border Patrol data for the area showed 26,086 apprehensions last year, compared with 628,000 in 1986. #SOTU 2/
The president said San Diego once had the most illegal immigration on the border, but crossings “almost completely ended” after a “strong security wall was put in place.” No wall, as Trump defined it as a candidate, has been built on the border in San Diego County. #SOTU 1/
Trump said North Korea has stopped nuclear tests and has not launched a missile in 15 months. Some experts say the regime no longer needs to conduct such tests because of advances in its nuclear weapons program. https://t.co/59OF0hXjnJ
Trump took credit for getting NATO allies "to pay their fair share" and said his administration had secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies. The pressure on NATO members began before Trump took office. #SOTU
Trump said the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, replacing NAFTA, will bring back manufacturing jobs and ensure more cars are made in America. The Peterson Institute for International Economics says the deal will likely raise costs and car prices. https://t.co/PfNtFY2E2T
Trump mentioned controversy surrounding Virginia governor Ralph Northam whose comments on a radio show 'described a hypothetical situation in which an infant who is severely deformed or unable to survive after birth could be left to die.' https://t.co/huRPBUK49A
President Trump introduced Grace Eline, who battled brain cancer. 	"Her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read 'last day of chemo'." Trump said. https://t.co/vSyU8ggs03
Trump called for "a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry." Federal officials said in December the funding would cover 115 miles of replacement fence and 100 miles of new fence. (The border is 2,000 miles.) https://t.co/cdKC91wyAQ
Trump said the U.S. Treasury is taking in billions in tariffs from China. But much of those $250 billion in tariffs are being absorbed by American companies or passed to American consumers. #SOTU
However, a Government Accountability Office report in 2017 noted that Customs and Border Protection has never evaluated the effectiveness of fences because they have no system of measurement. #SOTU 2/
President Trump said Border Patrol agents say “where walls go up, illegal crossings go down.” There is no dispute that barriers can be key to an effective border security system, especially in urban areas. #SOTU /1
President Trump said the nation has more women serving in the Congress than ever before. The surge was driven largely by Democrats as the party took over House control.  #SOTU https://t.co/zQln8jbsTA
President Trump said he's sending 3,750 additional troops to the border. Military members do not take part in immigrant apprehensions but will install 150 miles of concertina wire and provide other support. The total number of active military on the border is 4,350. #SOTU
Trump said lawmakers passed a tax cut for working families. It did generally cut taxes for lower- and middle-classes households but the Tax Policy Center said the vast majority of benefits will go to the top 1%. #SOTU
Trump said a border wall “immediately” changed El Paso, Texas, from one of the most dangerous in the country to one of the safest. The city’s crime rate actually plummeted before the wall was built. #sotu https://t.co/zVgOjZ5fhj
Migrants in caravans often hitch rides on trucks and in cars. And the governments of some Mexican states have provided buses to haul groups to other states, in part because they don't want to deal with providing shelter, food and other assistance to them. #SOTU /6
President Trump has made building a wall a major rallying cry of his presidency. Here is a look at how his messaging on the wall has changed over time. #SOTU	https://t.co/PpKQ5hhL5H
Trump said Congress approved a border wall, but claimed it “never got built.” The Secure Fence Act of 2006 called for 700 miles of fencing and more than 650 miles of that was erected, according to the Government Accountability Office. #SOTU	https://t.co/bhArUuT9Rh
For context, the caravans are isolated groups but part of a wave of migrants. They travel in groups to guard against criminals and corrupt police that extort money from them. Many are women, children, and families fleeing poverty and violence in Central America. #SOTU /5
Trump said more people are working than at any time in history -- 157 million. True, but the share of Americans in the labor force is at 63.2%, down from about 67% in 2000. #SOTU
President Trump introduced the family members of Gerald and Sharon David, who police in Nevada said were killed by an illegal immigrant. Read more about the case: https://t.co/f4HALZY9ON
Trump said unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. It did for most of the second half of last year, hitting 3.7%, though it ticked up to 4% in January, largely as a result of the government shutdown. #SOTU
Trump said the “lawless state” of our southern border is a threat to the safety of Americans, but all data indicates that immigrants (legal and undocumented) commit crimes at a lower rate than native-born Americans.	https://t.co/lDcQq06T8P
According to media reports, part of the caravan reached Piedras Negras, a border city in Mexico, across from Eagle Pass, Texas on Tuesday. Eagle Pass is a small city of about 29,000 people.  #SOTU 4/
Trump is correct that the majority of drugs that enter the U.S. cross the southern border. But he left out the fact that most of those drugs enter through ports of entry, not the vast stretches in between where he wants to build a border wall. #SOTU	https://t.co/LKoP2toSf2
On Jan. 29, U.S. Defense Under Secretary for Policy John Rood told lawmakers during a House Congressional hearing that the government was tracking three caravans, one with more than 12,000 people. /3
Trump said he wants immigrants to come to the country "in the largest numbers ever" so long as they do so legally, but his administration has tried to cut off many avenues of legal immigration and reduce the overall number of immigrants the US accepts.	https://t.co/hBPO3D6tSa
On Jan. 15, a group of several hundred migrants from Central America left San Pedro Sula, a city in Honduras, traveling through Mexico toward the U.S. border in hopes of asking for asylum . /2
Trump said the U.S. economy is the hottest anywhere in the world. Last year, it did grow faster than other advanced economies, such as Europe and Japan. But emerging markets grew faster. China grew 6.5% last year, compared to an estimated 3 percent for the U.S. #SOTU
Trump said immigration is a threat to the “financial well-being of all Americans.” A landmark study from the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine found immigrants, their children and grandchildren create a net benefit to U.S. economy. https://t.co/jrSONpyrYC

President Trump references "large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States." There are several caravans currently on the move toward the U.S. #SOTU Here's what we know:
The bipartisan criminal justice reform bill freed Matthew Charles, will help others like him and will give judges more discretion in sentencing. https://t.co/wBDai4WIvt
Matthew Charles is the first prisoner to be released because of the First Step Act. He was released on January 3 after being sentenced to 35 years in prison for drug-related offenses. He attended #SOTU as Trump's guest. https://t.co/wBDai4WIvt
Trump said the economy is growing almost twice as fast as when he took office. It's expected to grow about 3% this year compared to 1.6% in 2016. So he's roughly correct. But he spearheaded big tax cuts and spending increases to get there.
President Trump is talking about Alice Marie Johnson, a mother and grandmother, who was convicted as part of cocaine operation in 1994. Read her story: https://t.co/2auLwbg43I
Trump said he signed a law allowing the VA to terminate employees who mistreat veterans. He signed a law in 2017 making it easier to fire VA employees. GAO found that VA previously had “not consistently ensured” that senior officials were held accountable. https://t.co/52qWYqak56
Trump said wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades. The 3.1% annual average wage increase in January is the fastest since 2009. #SOTU
Trump said 600,000 new manufacturing jobs have been created under his watch. Since January 2017, 454,000 additional manufacturing jobs have been created.
Trump said he has created 5.3 million new jobs. Since January 2017, 4.9 million jobs non-farm have been created. #SOTU
Trump said he's brought about an unprecedented economic boom. The economy is estimated to have grown about 3 percent this year. That's the most only since 2005. And it was generated by a tax cut and government spending that's swelling the deficit. #sotu
President Trump recognized three World War II veterans attending the State of the Union. A majority of veterans approve of the job Trump is doing and 62% approve of his handling of border security, an AP poll in December found. #SOTU
