@Maro_Virino @laurenduca Sure, he probably is an absolute pig and probably used his wealth for sex.  But surely plenty of women have used sex for a piece of his wealth.  To deny that and to only blame one side is completely moronic.
@Maro_Virino @laurenduca The point is that his words were pretty clear. If they are so awful, why do they have to be misrepresented at all?  They shouldn't have to be if that argument is true.  But no, over and over people lie about what is said.  Women flat out sleep with high status males.
@Maro_Virino @laurenduca I think he left out that he only grabbed them or kissed them after 5 democrats did so first without permission. I mean, if we are going to just make up whatever narrative then perhaps that is the most accurate.
@laurenduca In the clip you are referring to, he has their consent.  He boasts about how easily they give consent to a man with money/power.   You are being disingenuous.

@UrbSocialiteSTL @Aladdin_Saddam @tariqnasheed Someone can't understand a point. Is there someone literate nearby or perhaps a child?
@Aladdin_Saddam @tariqnasheed But justified or not, it is still assault and frankly slapping someone  that had two hand occupied is pretty much chickensh*t.  Maybe next time he can hit a women while he is at it.
@Aladdin_Saddam @tariqnasheed Striking someone is assault.  It's sure not self defense and considering there is not yet any evidence posted that the kid said anything, it isn't even cosmic justice/karma.  It's just one kid slapping a kid that is holding food. Perhaps it is justified.
@tariqnasheed I'm glad to see that we have the assault on video.
@Steigerworld It stinks having to give money to that family. But it also created a national highlight where the fans booed the home team for a player they love.  Some players you just don't trade.  This was one. They can have 3 nice paydays for 78 lackluster ones.

@ShaunKing They tried to bring alcohol into an establishment where they don't have a liquor license. There are countless issues with this. Also, it is quite illegal to suggest that you are going to come back and shoot a place up.
@Super_Bro78 @tariqnasheed also, you may be able to call rap black, but it isn't even an american thing. it had it's start in jamaica. so feel free to thank the jamaican folk you meet for the product that your culture took from them.
@Super_Bro78 @tariqnasheed I won't ever dismiss blacks for their contribution. But your statement is not all that accurate. Much of the R&amp;B and soul of the 60s came out of studios that either had all white musicians or a mixture of musicians with black singers. Stax Volt, FAME, Muscle Shoals, and even Sun.

@tariqnasheed Drugging and raping dozens of women also increases the odds that someone is going to go to the law and that your days will be numbered. Even if 90 percent of these women are after money, that still leaves 5 women or more that insist he raped them. Racism has little to do here.
@tariqnasheed You shouldn't have found any.  The #metoo movement didn't really gain steam til Mid October last year. The Cosby trial was years in the making. It's pure ignorance to think that things would have moved far enough for court dates to be set.
@tariqnasheed Nonsense.  Kaepernick was never silenced as you suggest.  He is unemployed because he is a distraction and his play has slipped.  He'd have a job all last season if his gf didn't insult Steve Bisciotti. Your point holds very little water.
@KWintie If today's white man has to atone for the sins of the past then white women should have to do the same.  So, in the famous lynching of Emett Till, Carolyn Bryant Donham gave false testimony which led to his death. Tell us Kristi how you are going to atone for this.
@KWintie Be careful? I went to last years event and the people attending were nothing like you make them out to be.  Nothing matches your description of things.  Most of the people were quite lovely to be honest about it.
@brokehomietony @tariqnasheed If that were true then it's amazing how many black men have safely made their way to prison.  Somehow they all made it with no or little incident.  Plus it is hard to run in the woods while naked.. That tends to get in the way.

@Tellall2012 @tariqnasheed I rest my case.
@BarryGoldmon You sir are out of touch.  Nothing in that video has anything to do with religion or Christianity.  It has to do with wealthy people not wanting the status quo changing.  There were 8 years with Obama as president and that certainly didn't create busing to this school.

@BarryGoldmon I'm sure if there were another president that these parents would welcome change with open arms.  That would be 3 days after the sky rains pickles.

@realShreyasR @tariqnasheed This is because Tariq  is an opportunistic race baiter.   He is a faucet of idiocy.
@tariqnasheed You have no idea if it was racially motivated.  The guy was naked outside of a jacket and you are suggesting that you can divine what he was thinking and what motivated him.  It's just as likely that he hated clothed people or he was a fan of ihop as anything racially motivated.
