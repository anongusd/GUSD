A6. Over half of maternal and under-five deaths take place in fragile settings. Investments in maternal and child health in in crisis needs to be prioritized, particularly family planning and obstetric care. #SaveMomsAndKids https://t.co/oFBG6xEFXw
Follow this year’s Technical Expert Meeting on Adaptation (TEMA) via live broadcast https://t.co/UFHFhzT6w6 #TEMA #SB48Bonn @UNFCCC https://t.co/w4nOTRXKmd
3. Ensure women's participation in public planning &amp; decision-making: Unequal power relations often mean vulnerable groups and women are excluded from top down decision-making. So decisions do not take all local community needs into account.
In a social cost-benefit analysis, participants in @CARE’s Pathway’s program valued the program’s benefits at $31 for every $1 invested. Nearly 40% of that return was due to the gender equality benefits. #TEMA @UNFCCC
- Tripled women’s access to extension and information. 	- Increased yields as much as 200% on some fields and crops; increased agricultural production by nearly 540K metric tons. 	- Generated $7.3M in revenue for female farmers and businesses.
Through Pathways, @CARE worked with communities to enable women to secure 11K acres of land – that’s half the size of Manhattan. #TEMA @UNFCCC
2. Give access to &amp; control over resources including climate info, land, education, extension services, technology, inputs, credit and finance. A @CARE example, Pathways. #TEMA @UNFCCC
1. Ensure programs are mindful of the dual labor burden women have (unpaid farmers + domestic care work). Support women's roles as decision makers in the household and the community. #TEMA @UNFCCC
Women need to be seen as agents of change. How we address women’s role in food security and their individual food security? We must take into account the underlying factors and barriers (political, financial, social, etc.) that stand in the way of empowering women. #TEMA @UNFCCC
Yet, despite their central roles and there are often disproportionate labor burden. Women experience unequal access to resources for sustainable productive resilient livelihoods. And women are last to eat when food is scarce in the family.  #TEMA @UNFCCC
But food security is more than production – women are also responsible for overall wellbeing of family. #TEMA @UNFCCC
Women are chiefly responsible for family’s food security – often in charge of growing or buying food for home consumption. #TEMA @UNFCCC

If you want true women's empowerment, you must address the power structure, women’s skills and social norms. #WomenOnTheMove #MyanmarRefugee
“CARE has set up women-only spaces where we can engage with women, talk about life skills and reproductive health. But it’s also important to talk with the power holders, the men in camps.” - Stav Zotalis of CARE Myanmar #WomenOnTheMove #MyanmarRefugee
Monsoon season will exacerbate the lack of women and girls' access to resources &amp; existing protection risks, like sending young girls and boys outside the camp for work, domestic violence, and reliance on men to access fuel. #WomenOnTheMove #MyanmarRefugee https://t.co/KHN2ZGbAeq
Why is it so important to talk about #Myanmar now? With the onset of monsoon season, hundreds of thousands of refugees face the risk of extensive loss of life, destruction of homes and services, and injury. #WomenOnTheMove #MyanmarRefugee https://t.co/orUF1eUBsP
WATCH: Zia Choudhury of CARE Bangladesh gives a glimpse of what daily life is like for #women in refugee camps. #WomenOnTheMove #MyanmarRefugee https://t.co/IbfEHnfOZQ
“We could ask our govt’s to push the idea that, let’s create the platform so women can get organized and speak up. If you haven’t had the ability to speak up for decades, it’s a hard thing to do!” – Zia Choudhury, CARE Bangladesh https://t.co/CmKayeFStv
“We must make sure a million people in Bangladesh are looked after, not just food and water, but opportunities for women who have suffered discrimination to be offered livelihood training and education.” - Stav Zotalis of CARE Myanmar #WomenOnTheMove #MyanmarRefugee
“Another barrier to people going back home is local communities may not welcome them back.” - Stav Zotalis of CARE Myanmar #WomenOnTheMove #MyanmarRefugee
.@CARE has been working in the refugee camps since the beginning of the crisis providing emergency shelter, medical support, clean water, sanitation, gender-based violence support &amp; more. #WomenOnTheMove #MyanmarRefugee https://t.co/gsblY1uShj
“Most people say the same thing, ‘I want to go home, but when it’s safe.’ But women &amp; children may never go back because they’ve lost male members of their family and have been so brutalized.” – Zia Choudhury, CARE Bangladesh #WomenOnTheMove #MyanmarRefugee
Zia Choudhury explains why the govermment of Bangladesh won't register more refugees: “You have 1,000% increased the density of the area, &amp; the govt. is worried for their environment, economy and other impacts of having this many people in a small area.” #WomenOnTheMove
Cox's Bazar, #Bangladesh is the largest and most dense refugee settlement in the world. Threats of violence, coercion and deprivation are high. #WomenOnTheMove #MyanmarRefugee https://t.co/IwHaMT5ENn
“Women are without their normal social networks and lack sufficient services… In this year alone, we expect 40K women to give birth with limited services.” – Zia Choudhury, CARE Bangladesh #WomenOnTheMove #MyanmarRefugee
Main concern in refugee camps is spread of disease, flooding and other hazards, along with the sheer number of people, including the disproportionate number of women. #WomenOnTheMove #MyanmarRefugee
“If you go to the camps now and walk up the first hill you will just see endless plastic shacks and they are packed so tightly... a sea of plastic shacks.” – Zia Choudhury, CARE Bangladesh #WomenOnTheMove #MyanmarRefugee
Zia Choudhury recalls the most surprising things he noticed in Cox’s Bazar: “The sheer number of people, the number of women and children and that people were totally lost and confused.” #WomenOnTheMove #MyanmarRefugee
“In Cox’s Bazar, we drove to where the refugees were gathering and in those first hours when we got there, for me who has worked w/ refugees for 20 years, it was one of the most shocking things I’d ever seen.” – Zia Choudhury, CARE Bangladesh #WomenOnTheMove #MyanmarRefugee https://t.co/A9M852X7XV
