@jslez @drvox @MikeDrewWhat It's not the last 20 years. It's all of human history. I won't be quiet while people like you pretty much guarantee no progress. Sorry for the bluntness. I really don't mean to be insulting. But the stakes are too high.
@ijkijKevin @drvox @MikeDrewWhat I'm all in favor. I'm in favor of practically anything that can actually be passed. However, adaptation will not help the ~3 billion people in the global south.
@drvox @jslez @MikeDrewWhat Sure. I'm in favor of that too. Also puppies and apple pie. As for why I write what I do, it's because the longer we keep kidding ourselves about these grandiose plans, the more likely planetary suicide is.
@JohnO109 @drvox @MikeDrewWhat No. Check my blog for more. https://t.co/kEOcryYj1V		I'm actually in favor of everything. I just think we should proritize things that are politically feasible.
@jslez @drvox @MikeDrewWhat "Massive political momentum." Come on. Can we be serious about this?
@drvox @MikeDrewWhat 10:1 is a longshot. I'd put the odds of a big, comprehensive climate plan at 1000:1. Continuing to put our energy behind this is suicidal.
@jslez @drvox @MikeDrewWhat You act as if this is the very first climate plan ever introduced.
@drvox @MikeDrewWhat Because the longer we put up with this stuff, the worse off we are. The GND was very carefully put together to offend no one. Same old, same old.
@jslez @drvox @MikeDrewWhat Once again: it's not a plan. It's a restatement of goals that have been around for 20 years. Why am I supposed to be impressed by that?
@drvox @MikeDrewWhat OK, serious question: do you expect them to release a plan in the next month or two? Do you expect it to be anything close to what's needed? Will we all hold them accountable for that?
@drvox Come on, David. Goals are a dime a dozen. They're meaningless unless the folks involved provide at least a bit of a sense of how they're suggesting we get there. Otherwise it's the equivalent of "the tax cut will be balanced by spending cuts which we'll leave up to Congress."

@gibletsMoon @drvox https://t.co/Mazo02Of7S		Though tbh this isn't nearly a complete plan either. Like GND, it affects the US only, and thus does very little to reduce global carbon emissions.

@twainus @mcclure111 @orzelc Because we're in early days. Google (and many others) are trying to go beyond what we're really capable of yet.
@soncharm The reason you didn't put "initially" in quotes is because I didn't say it! He believed ACA unconstitutional based on commerce clause, and continued to believe that. But he later came to believe it was OK as a tax. But wasn't willing to say so without a payoff.

@rdsathene @MotherJones That piece provides no evidence at all that ATCs were the main reason Trump caved. OTOH, I provided plenty to suggest they weren't. I *wish* a union action had been what brought down Trump, but the timeline just doesn't fit very well.

@enviroenforcer That said, thanks for pointing out that I didn't even mention how the EPA measures lead levels in this article. I've revised it to add that.
@enviroenforcer I appreciate that you (seem) to want everything written to the standards of peer-reviewed science journals, but that's not appropriate for laymen. I've explained where everything comes from and expressed my opinions, and I don't believe any of it has been misleading.
@enviroenforcer It's not wrong, it's just a different method of measurement, using the data that was publicly available at the time. I said nothing about "compliance" in any official sense.
@enviroenforcer I'm using a monthly measurement, not the official federal measurement. I was doing this in real time, and six months is too long to wait between data points. But you're probably right that I should make this a little clearer.
@enviroenforcer @ChadLivengood @MotherJones You keep changing the subject whenever I answer a question. I think you need to find someone else to play games with.

CORRECTED: How much attention is Beto O'Rourke getting right now? https://t.co/4IqrOeYWSd via @MotherJones https://t.co/PxFzQEt224
@nbeaudrot Well, as it turns out, I've corrected the chart and it turns out Beto is getting a little more attention than I thought. But point taken.
@TimothyODonnel2 I am comparing attention paid to people in the news recently. They don't have to be running for president.
This has nothing to do with Twitter. It's Google Trends, which covers searches over the entire internet. https://t.co/UeuRK0SgMM
@NateSilver538 That's only (partly) true of Kamala Harris. The others have common names that produce bad results unless you use the full name.
That said, I wouldn't put a ton of faith into a Google Trends comparison. However, when I used full names, I get Beto at the bottom. I'm not sure what we're doing differently.
I originally did this search using just "beto," and I got pretty much the same results. For comparisons, though, the only way to do it is with full names. Obviously "beto" and "elizabeth" aren't comparable. My comparison chart (the third one) uses full names. https://t.co/WL7huQU8Gb

@haroldpollack @sltax @MotherJones Although keep in mind that the meh 55-200 zoom is probably better than the best 55-200 on the planet in 1982. Also, worth looking into non-35mm cameras these days.
@haroldpollack @MotherJones Ironically, what I want these days isn't really all that expensive. Modern technology is unbelievable for someone whose first camera was a 35 mm rangefinder with literally zero built-in tech. I'm just stunned by what modern cameras can do.
@haroldpollack @MotherJones I ran out of room to mention this in my first tweet, but I have to admit that photography as a hobby is a lot more fun now that I'm older and can afford (almost) anything I want pretty easily.
@haroldpollack @MotherJones Thanks! I'm sure this is just a coincidence, but shortly after Donald Trump took office I felt like I really needed a hobby. Since I've dabbled in photography off and on since I was a teenager, that was an obvious choice. It's been great.

@salonium @MotherJones Why on earth should it be? This isn't a journal article, it's a blog post for laymen.
@salonium @MotherJones How else would you do it? These numbers are the best we have and have been for many years. Also, they fit the sales data we have.
@salonium @MotherJones I did clarify that, but maybe not enough. The problem is that if you want to see the *trend* in vaping, you really have no choice but to use the "all vaping" category.
@RenoCow @MotherJones Sure it makes sense. But SecDef is a policy position. You just can't leave him there after a public resignation letter like that.

Something worth keeping in mind: If you favor less US intervention abroad in general, you have to accept the consequences of less intervention in specific cases. It's not cost free.
So how long will it be before Trump realizes just how insulting Mattis's letter was and starts a whole tweet tantrum about how Mattis was a terrible SecDef all along?
@fakesarahjeong @MotherJones Fair point. OTOH, Pentagon says we were 20% done after four years. At that rate, how do you ever finish?
@Sebasti01463369 @hilzoy Yeah, I'm in this camp too. Obviously a well-planned withdawal over a period of time agreed in advance would be better. Still, even from Dems a lot of the criticism seems to be about withdrawal per se, even if done prudently.

@bendreyfuss This has always been the big question: does vaping mostly help smokers switch to something better, or does it mostly attract whole new customers? A couple of years ago I was on the fence, but now the evidence is clear: it mostly attracts new customers.
@bendreyfuss Agreed re: tar and lung cancer. Which are pretty bad! But I have a real loathing of anything addictive being deliberately marketed to kids, and that's the main similarity. It's truly contemptible.

@willwilkinson I wonder if that's right. I think plenty of Democrats prefer, or would at least tolerate, big dumb rules. I'm one. The problem is that it's just too hard to fight all the interest groups, so in the end you have to decide if you'll take half a loaf. /1

@paulzakalwe @MalcolmNance @MotherJones "Informing" means choosing to display data in way that best shows what's important. If you need to show a 4% change, you have to choose a y-axis that actually shows it. Should I have made a slightly different choice? That's arguable of course. But certainly nothing big.
@paulzakalwe @MalcolmNance @MotherJones Sorry, but if you believe zero is always the right starting point for the y-axis, then you're presenting data wrong.
@paulzakalwe @MalcolmNance @MotherJones No. It's. Not. Stop trying to sound smart by idiotically pretending that all charts should start at zero.

@xpostfactoid I'm not sure if this is because I just don't care enough, or because I'm getting old.
@xpostfactoid Yeah, I have to refresh myself every damn time this comes up.
@orzelc You would say that, wouldn't you? Oh wait. I just read the post. That Nobel metric is ridiculous.
@xpostfactoid Biggest issue is that you only get one reconciliation per year. So ACA bill would have to be good enough to be your best reconciliation candidate. If it were a choice between a pretty good ACA bill and, say, a pretty good minimum wage bill, which should get the nod? Decisions....

@hiltzikm FWIW, the real thing you want to look at is acceleration. Real wages *have* been positive for a while, but they aren't accelerating. Just the opposite.
@hiltzikm It's 3.0% and 2.6%. Real increase is 0.4%. You need to calculate CPI quarterly to match ECI.
@Wertwhile I think that's slightly off, but it doesn't matter. The point is that you have to account for it. https://t.co/DpehUJv5WM

Democrats do not advocate open borders. Democrats have placed a number of immigration proposals on the table over the past decade or so, and they’re all easy to find and read.
Democrats will not destroy Medicare or Social Security.
US Steel is not opening eight new plants. Or seven. Or six. Or even one.
The Veterans Choice Act was signed into law by President Obama in 2014, not by Trump. In 2017 Trump signed a bill approving a new version of the act that he likes better, but without bothering to fund it.
Trump’s various health care plans did not protect people with pre-existing conditions.
Trump has not started building his wall. Nor is Mexico paying for his nonexistent wall.
Crime is not increasing.
There’s no evidence that the caravan of migrants walking north from Guatemala includes any Middle Eastern terrorists.
Selling arms to Saudi Arabia, in whatever quantities, will not generate 500,000 jobs. Or 600,000 jobs. Or 1 million jobs. The entire defense industry only employs about 300,000 people in the first place, and Saudi Arabia is not that big a customer.
We do not have a $110 billion deal to supply arms to Saudi Arabia. We don’t really have any kind of deal at all, let alone one of that size.
Illegal immigration is not increasing.
Republicans do not have any kind of plan to lower middle-class taxes after the election.
Democrats do not want to give Cadillacs to undocumented immigrants.
There are no riots here in California.

@LarryGlickman @rickperlstein Also worth noting that aside from Gingrich, you also have Drudge, Limbaugh, and Fox all at about the same time (1990-96). Gingrich provided the leadership, but the others provided him with a very wide reach.
@LarryGlickman @rickperlstein Everything always goes back further. You can take this back to the John Birch Society. Or the American League. And Nixon certainly planted many of the seeds for this. But if you want to start with the time in which conservative victimization really bloomed, it's Gingrich. /1

@foswi @ThorntonHall1 This is a super simplistic gloss, but it's the basic shape of things. There were really no heroes on either side. No visionaries or customer advocates, either.
@foswi @ThorntonHall1 The upshot was that European banks supported chips because they needed something. American banks didn't want to bother because their losses from fraud were already under control. /3
@foswi @ThorntonHall1 European banks generally didn't have these legal requirements (though this depends on time/place/etc.). So they never developed the algorithms. As a result, when ID theft went big time, they needed a solution. Making customers eat every bad debt just wouldn't work forever. /2
@foswi @ThorntonHall1 Very roughly speaking: US banks were forced by law to eat bad charges, so they worked hard to develop sophisticated algorithms that detected suspicious activity. They did a good job! That's why we all get so many calls asking "Did you just charge something in Minot, ND"? /1
@maxpinton That's also true, though it wasn't true back in 1968. It evolved later as the banks gained leverage (merchants *had* to accept credit cards if they wanted to stay in business).
The really amazing thing about this is that 1968 was almost literally the last moment such a law could have been passed. Within a decade, we couldn't have passed a bill requiring banks to pick up the phone, let alone automatically delete a charge.
Yes, this is basically true. US banks *had* to suck up credit card losses because of the 1968 Consumer Credit Protection Act, passed back when credit cards were new and amazing. /1 https://t.co/N9Yv9N5bHH

@joftius This is about all police killings, not killings of unarmed black children, which is the subject of Kessler's column and mine. I agree with you about the general effect of police killings, but we should still be willing to be honest about killings of unarmed kids.
@joftius Your stats class must be a blast! But statistical significance doesn't even play into this. There's one incident in four years. That's it. No t-test, no nothing. As for other comparable countries, how could they possibly have very many killings of unarmed black children?
@joftius You might be the only person on the planet to characterize it this way, but OK. Do you disagree that 0-1 over four years suggests a phenomenom that's not really happening?
@joftius That is nothing close to my argument. My argument is that Kessler is correct to say that 0-1 shootings of unarmed black children over four years is a very small number indeed. Ditto for teens. Maybe also for adults depending on how seriously you take knives.
@bmaz @MotherJones Maybe ... as journalistic work product, it's possible a judge would be reluctant to issue a warrant.

@DLROhlms No, you were not "required" to say anything. And none of it offended me, so no worries on that score.
Just a quick reminder: our cultural agreement not to speak ill of the dead isn't some new Twitter-era thing. The idea is to give the family a decent period to mourn before the attacks begin. It's only a few days or a week at most. You can do it if you try.
@jdpink @felixsalmon @ProfSchleich There's a limit to that. An area that's, say, 90% Democratic is very hard to redistrict. You'll end up with districts that are 60-70-80% D no matter how hard you try.
@felixsalmon @ProfSchleich I'd suggest that causation goes in the other direction. Plus, cities pack all the progressives into tiny districts. It's basically self-gerrymandering.
@Unabogie @ftrodriguez @SewertownNews (6) All those things together suggest that it's an ill-conceived protest. It does more damage to the cause than good. Conversely, the bus boycott was very thoroughly thought out before it was started. It generated sympathy outside the South, not outrage. /end
@Unabogie @ftrodriguez @SewertownNews (4) The protesters have spent two years explaining that they're *really* protesting police injustice, and that message still hasn't gotten through. Like it or not, this suggests it will never get through. (5) There's no end point. What could happen to cause the protest to end? /3
@Unabogie @ftrodriguez @SewertownNews therefore, any deliberate refusal to stand for the national anthem is a sign of deliberate disrespect for the country. (3) These things are true regardless of whether you or I personally agree with them. /2
@Unabogie @ftrodriguez @SewertownNews I'm fine. But honestly, Twitter is the worst possible place for a conversation like this. Briefly, though, a couple of points. (1) Nobody has a patriotic attachment to a bus. Lots of people have patriotic attachments to the national anthem. (2) To lots of people, /1
@ftrodriguez @SewertownNews @Unabogie I've been asleep all day. Plus I generally don't tweet much anyway.

Raw Data: Rental prices in Orange County https://t.co/K06O6XnrQB via @MotherJones https://t.co/dcxfvlGsri
@PoulChapman One thing to keep in mind is that in most places this is less related to skyrocketing housing prices than it is to stagnating wages ever since 2000. That's the core problem, and it's an example of something I think is much more important for progressives to address nationally.

@ProfSchleich @jenny_schuetz @albouy Oh, I wasn't referring to you. But most people who respond to me start out by calling me a clueless boomer idiot who just wants to lock millennials out of the paradise I live in. Actually, many of them end there too.
@ProfSchleich @jenny_schuetz @albouy And no motives will be attacked! I'm in a good mood today. But I wonder if the folks who disagree with me will ever extend the same courtesy?
@ProfSchleich @jenny_schuetz @albouy Hmmm. "Near consensus among scholars" needs some serious breakdown. But maybe later.
@pushtheneedle @GustavSachse @bruteforceblog I dunno. Could be. But honestly, that's a helluva mental calculation to be making for most people. The effect on home prices is pretty small, which of course is one of my points in the first place. But I could be wrong.
@GustavSachse @pushtheneedle @bruteforceblog That's a transit issue. It's related to urbanization, of course, but it's only one smallish part.
@ProfSchleich @jenny_schuetz @albouy Maybe we're thinking of something different. The kind of "comparison of everything" I'm talking about is something I haven't seen. However, before this goes further, I owe you a clear explanation of what my real #1 issue is. Better as a blog post, though. Give me a few hours.
Friday dachshund blogging – 24 August 2018 https://t.co/7ZOLIqnJvL via @MotherJones https://t.co/w4xzUgpQCr
@ProfSchleich That's because it's an almost impossible comparison to make. I'm not aware of anyone who's done it in a rigorous way. In any case, my main concern is public opinion, not the land law that ends up as the result. Until you deal with public opinion, the laws will never change.
@LizrdBreath This is obviously no longer a good faith conversation. You read the post. You know what I said.
@ProfSchleich I'm sure we've both read the same papers, but apparently we've come to different conclusions.
@NoahJSnyder Nope. The analogy would be that millennials just want cheap housing that other people pay the price for. Would you call that a fair statement?
@LizrdBreath What? I know that lots of people want to *live* in dense neighborhoods. Isn't that the whole point of this entire discussion?
@ProfSchleich No. I just believe the per capita incremental gains would be very small.
No credit? No problem! Buy a house anyway. https://t.co/uYdlsiveb7 via @MotherJones
@StruMatt Why not focus instead on adding density in medium size cities, where it's less opposed? It's probably even better for the environment, better for renters, and better for economic growth. Returns to scale diminish even for urbanization.
@EoboOboe Right.
@LizrdBreath There's other research on this that shows only minuscule differences between renters and homeowners. Renters generally don't want buildings across the street from them either. They want them somewhere else.

@huzzahmpls Oh, I know. Same thing happens here in SoCal. It happens everywhere. Thus my headline.
@huzzahmpls This could use a ton of unpacking, but I don't doubt your description. Still, it's only one neighborhood. Others are different (but with mostly the same result).
@LizrdBreath Why do you think I'm ignoring renters?
Everyone is selfish, no matter their age. And they always have plenty of altruistic justifications to hide it. https://t.co/iof8Q4wOWR
But if you respect me, perhaps you should give my take more respect even if you disagree with it. I've written about this considerably. https://t.co/LN1ElEIpaX
@huzzahmpls That's kind of my point. Lots of people *say* they support more housing, but when an actual development in an actual neighborhood is on the agenda, that support vanishes. Not always, but mostly. There's a reason all these laws exist, after all, and they mostly predate boomers.

@shapiro_stuart Is that your final answer, or will it be something else if I waste my time responding? The co-benefits are particulates and ozone. The carbon costs can be removed completely and there's still a net benefit.
@shapiro_stuart The Obama plan includes a 7% scenario and shows net positive benefits even if you eliminate climate benefits completely.

@StambaughRyan @MotherJones FactSet, according to the WSJ.

@StambaughRyan @MotherJones You can keep going back and forth on this forever, but even if you cherry pick stats, you're just not going to find that wages are up a lot. Sure, maybe in North Dakota for truckers working on shale oil fields during the winter, or something, but overall wages just aren't up.

@StambaughRyan @MotherJones Wages for retail employees up 2.3% in past year. That's less than inflation rate, so there's zero real wage pressure. And yes, real is what matters unless you think retailers don't raise prices in line with inflation.
ZOMG! From Trey Gowdy?!? https://t.co/mhP49IT8CF
@StambaughRyan @MotherJones No, that's not at all what I said. Maybe best to skip this. I'm obviously not going to change your mind.
@StambaughRyan @MotherJones If you have any particular industry in mind, we can probably look at wages just for that industry.
@StambaughRyan @MotherJones Sure, some industries are facing pressure. That's always the case. But overall, nope. And nominal wages are only really relevant during a recession, not when the economy is expanding and inflation is positive.

@DavidL206 I've listened endlessly! But I really don't think the densification folks do. They simply refuse to believe that opposition to their ideas can ever be motivated by reasonable differences. It's always "mindless NIMBYism" or racism or something similar.

@orteleus @MotherJones Carbon capture just isn't technically feasible yet. Ditto for geoengineering, but it also strikes most people as a last-ditch solution since it would almost certainly have big and unknown side effects.
@wataruen @MotherJones The document wasn't an afterthought. It was the best they could do after several weeks of working-level talks. As for Kim, I don't think anyone knows what he really thinks. But I certainly agree that everything hinges on him.
@wataruen @MotherJones I don't have the same sense. That said, I agree (and said) that we'll have to wait to see how things go. But do you seriously think no one should bother speaking the obvious truth about what's happened so far?

Not sure I get it. "Justify" is meant to say that Peterson is being used as additional evidence to support a view already held. Just as slaveholders used the Bible to justify black slavery (though with far *less* textual evidence.) Seems like a legit use of the word. https://t.co/t0OhIfT2PX
@ojdunford @conor64 They've already made the case for zoning rules, many years ago, and a large majority of the public likes them. You just happen to disagree.

ffs, new California law requires urban water districts to develop plans by 2022 to cut water use 20%. That's really about it. The 55-gallon thing is a daily *average* and is just one possible way to figure out the required target.

@VoxTechnologie @doofusdan @MotherJones I guess that's true if you ignore the dual axes. Not sure how you can show this and still get enough detail to make the chart useful. With one axes, there's barely any change visible over time. If you just show % change, you get no sense of the scale at all.
@VoxTechnologie @doofusdan @MotherJones Why? Are you confused by it? Or do you just not like dual-axis charts in general?
@VoxTechnologie @doofusdan @MotherJones Or I could index the lines to a common starting point. But then you lose the absolute values, which are valuable in this case. The dual axis gives both, and color makes it easy to read. I think the prejudice against dual-axis charts is misguided. It's sometimes the best choice.
@doofusdan @MotherJones This is a perfect use of a dual-axis chart! With only one axis, the blue line is a few millimeters from the base and practically horizontal. It's effectively useless, as I found out when I tried it.
@davidgaliel @MotherJones Take a look at this for starters: https://t.co/st2B0lySpD
@DuaneHere @MotherJones No it's not. Look at the data.
@davidgaliel @MotherJones This is just net worth. It's *in addition* to whatever income they have (Social Security, Medicare, pensions, 401(k)s, etc.).
@rowing_bee @MotherJones No, I went to college for free, more or less.
@fachapman @MotherJones The charts don't show income at all. And senior income above the bottom third isn't especially low.
@ASankin @ClaraJeffery Yes, and my wife now folds all our kitchen towels the KonMarie way. They look great, but I have no idea how to put a towel away anymore.
@ATree87571299 @dandolfa @MotherJones True. However I still think the much bigger problem is the non-college young. We college types still get the good jobs and eventually make money. And of course we write a lot, so we get heard. The rest get royally screwed and their voices are never heard.

@EN_parker BTW, one thing to keep in mind is that these stats are always for Metropolitan Statistical Areas, which includes some areas surrounding each city. The New York MSA includes Newark, for example. If you're thinking only of Manhattan, my guess is that rents have gone up more.
@EN_parker The "income" in this ratio is for the whole US, not just for those cities.
@MarketUrbanism There are things that rent relative to income doesn't tell you. But one thing it *does* tell you is how affordable rent is. Keep in mind that "income" here is average for the whole US, not just for those cities.

@bradplumer It would actually be nice if someone did a rigorous study of *net* green-ness of cities taking into account everything. I haven't been able to find one, which is why I hedged in my paragraph about that.
@bradplumer Here's the study: https://t.co/VVyaPpS0gV Maybe I misread it. But it comes from a city-friendly group....
@bradplumer There's more to it than that, but yes. However, moving to a city to get a higher paying job increases your absolute consumption.
@steventberry This is not what I said. I said that adding density in a city increases congestion *in the city.* It does. Nor did I say that it helps the environment. I said that density isn't *as green* as people think. It's not.
@ADowling34 @bradplumer Yes they do. But not as much as you think.
@bradplumer I said density doesn't increase productivity very much. But cities are unquestionably richer than rural areas.

@catlin201 @MotherJones @HeerJeet There's no question that Williamson suggested women who get abortions should be executed. I'm not saying otherwise. However, his reason for suggesting *hanging* was related solely to his views on capital punishment. That's really pretty clear if you read the podcast transcript.
@GregAnrig @MotherJones That's not what I thought your objection would be! But are illustrations of hanging all verboten because of lynching? The Williamson affair was all about hanging, so I wanted to use an applicable illustration.

@mhoeft @drvox @mattyglesias @karlbykarlsmith Of course. Those are the arguments you need to address. They're the ones preventing you from doing what you want.
@DPsocialism I haven't blocked anything. I'm just trying to explain the realities of the situation on the ground. You need to understand this if you hope to make a change.
@DPsocialism It's just an analogy. Basic point is that it would take a ton of new housing to make a real dent in prices.
@applarson Personally, I don't care. But if you ask city dwellers, the answer is traffic. The answer is always traffic. And the answer is always ignored.
@morganbird @mattyglesias @karlbykarlsmith Yes, I've read it. I don't believe that most of it truly engages with the strongest arguments, both political and technical, on the other side.
@TommSciortino I'm always surprised by the long list of things that people think never occur to me.
@ScottLucas86 That was an analogy. But when demand for a resource is already far greater than supply, adding more of the resource will mostly attract people willing to pay a high price first. Takes a very long time to have a serious downward effect.
@drvox @mattyglesias @karlbykarlsmith Traffic is still the problem, no matter what kind of housing you build.
@mattyglesias @karlbykarlsmith I don't think you've ever seriously engaged with your critics on this subject. You really should. Treating this as an Econ 101 problem just isn't enough.
@karlbykarlsmith @mattyglesias No no no! The scarce resource is not "land," it's a very particular type of land: streets. The solution is...I'm not sure. Mass transit is the conventional answer. But that's the resource you need to think about. Maybe congestion pricing everywhere is the answer.
@mattyglesias I don't get it. Doesn't literally everybody understand that land prices are the key to housing prices? Location, location, location.

@nbeaudrot Oh...I dunno. They both tell pretty similar stories. I could make a case for either one. Anyway, I'm too lazy to do this chart yet again.

@jchasbeck It's also worth noting that most of the worst aspects of the crime bill were GOP provisions needed to get the votes to pass. They're still there, so Clinton gets some responsibility for them, but it's still Republicans who had primary responsibility.
@jchasbeck Everything plays a role. But the 1994 act's role in mass incarceration was almost certainly quite small.
@jchasbeck The first claim is simply fact. You can't possibly read the history of the 70s and 80s and deny this.
@jchasbeck That's mostly at the state level.
