USACE Task Force Power Restoration Commander Col. John Lloyd: This is the greatest challenge outside of combat I have ever faced.
"I'm confident that the majority of Puerto Rico, probably 95%, I'm talking customers or clients will have restored power by the middle of march, certainly by the end of march. The problem is that last 5%," said USACE Col. John Lloyd, Task Force Power Restoration Commander.
BY MID MARCH, CERTAINLY BY END OF MARCH - That's when USACE believes the MAJORITY (95% of clients) of Puerto Rico will have power restored.
"900,000 clients are energized (in Puerto Rico), so right above 60%," said Col. John Lloyd, USACE Task Force Power Restoration Commander
