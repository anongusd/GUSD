Amidst a generally historic disaster of a presidency, let‚Äôs not lose sight of the extraordinarily historic thing that happened today: 		The President of the United States of America‚Äôs personal lawyer testified to Congress accusing the President of multiple of crimes.
I‚Äôd like to nominate Elijah Cummings to be our nation‚Äôs official conscience.
I‚Äòm inspired by Rep. Cummings‚Äô powerful optimism and I deeply hope that everyone supporting Trump now comes to see clearly and regret it someday, hopefully soon. Not sure I believe it but I really really really hope for it.
Wow, if Michael Cohen was biting his tongue not only about Trump‚Äôs crimes but his policies ‚Äî he just UNLEASHED.
Anyway there's something sickly convenient in even asking the question now that it's a black gay man now accused of falsifying a crime -- as though, to @claycane's point, it's cover for continuing to discount and dismiss the credibility of black people and queer people
* Also note that the fact that she so flagrantly falsely concocted a story accusing a black man of the crime didn't make anyone back then go, "Huh, maybe we should do address the broader phenomenon of black people being falsely accused..."
And lastly... I said on set:		In 1994, when Susan Smith -- a white woman -- killed her two children and then falsely accused a black man of the crime, NO ONE suggested there was a danger that white women would be less believed as victims in the future.*
Also: 		Hate crimes in America are on the rise against Muslims, against Jews, against people of color, against queer people.		Our compassion shouldn't be subject to who the victims are or which political side we're trying to advance.
Thanks to @TheDrPhilShow for having me BUT let me say here what wasn't in edited clip		* 99.7% of reported hate crimes are verified		* Upwards of 97% of hate crimes are never reported		* We don't know what happened to Jussie. We do know too many victims are ignored. Or worse. https://t.co/x2WZy7cneD
In fairness, Republicans can walk and chew gum at the same time, too. 	They‚Äôre trying to cover Trump‚Äôs ass at the same time they‚Äôre voting against common sense gun control and basic health care access for women. https://t.co/MVaai5uf4W
Republican‚Äôs desperate strategy seems to be smearing Michael Cohen as a scumbag ‚Äî as though that doesn‚Äôt suggest the man who hired him as his personal attorney for 10 years is also a scumbag
Seems to me that a lot of these GOP member‚Äôs comments and questions trying to cover for President Trump are gonna make amazing clips in the ads of Democrats running against them in 2020 ‚Äî especially if/when Trump is indicted or impeached
Republican Congressman: Michael Cohen is giving pointless testimony that no one cares about and is wasting our time which is why I‚Äôm now going to make a lengthy showy statement
Just FYI, y'all: 	https://t.co/6zwsRsNGGA https://t.co/JJo9Hl9kiM
All these Republicans in the committee are notably grandstanding while accusing Cohen of grandstanding.
Why haven't you turned over to authorities boxes of information that the authorities already seized, went through, and returned?!!
I'm so sorry for what your family is going through and now I'm going to bash you and shame you more.
The story Michael Cohen is telling right now about how he came to work for Trump is incomplete.  In the version he once told me personally in 2016, he "overturned" the board by literally throwing an elderly gentleman off a stage.  And *THAT* impressed Trump.
Republicans: 	WHY THE HELL WOULD ATTENTION MAGNET LANNY DAVIS REPRESENT MICHAEL COHEN *FOR FREE*?!?!?		Also Republicans:  	God bless Paul Manafort, Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump himself for not taking a salary!  Those heroic, honorable men, them...
If we should judge Michael Cohen for hiring a lawyer like Lanny Davis, shouldn't we judge Donald Trump for hiring a lawyer like Michael Cohen!??!?!  That's how that works, right?

@thekellymantle Bwaaaaaah!
People are comparing Chuck and Nancy to American Gothic but I think they‚Äôre more mid-century modern.
And if Trump actually gets what he *says* he wants, and it doesn‚Äôt make a damn difference (which the wall won‚Äôt ‚Äî in fact, it could make things for migrants and citizens worse!) his base might finally catch onto the scam Trump‚Äôs been running on him.
But I increasingly think Trump doesn‚Äôt want to make a deal because he understands that his political ‚Äúgift‚Äù lies with exacerbating and exploiting problems rather than actually solving them. He‚Äôs not a leader, he‚Äôs a huckster.
Bear in mind, Democrats have already passed legislation for $1.3 billion in add‚Äôl border security. Trump could nudge that up a bit and call it a win. And clearly some Dems, including Schumer, have supported some kind of partial wall before. Trump could make a deal.
... or whether at this point he‚Äôs decided, temperamentally or politically, he‚Äôd rather just stand firm with his base and get nothing than actually make a deal and compromise with Democrats.
Trump had control of both houses of Congress for two years and couldn‚Äôt get his wall funded. Which begs the question whether he‚Äôs throwing down *now* to cover up for his own failure to deliver when it was infinitely easier...
I keep thinking about a point @JohnKingCNN made last night ‚Äî that Trump largely won on border security promises and, if he was such a great deal maker and indeed *wanted* to make a deal, he could have barnstormed the country, made the case and gotten *something* passed

Praying for the sanity of the majority of the American people, that they will continue to understand how pointless and reckless Trump's wall is -- and how absolutely offensively childish it is for him to shutdown our government and stop paying 800,000 people to try to get his way

Bipartisan proposals have put forward MUCH of the OTHER BORDER SECURITY Trump is describing here.  Most everyone agrees in better medical care, clearing judicial clogs, more surveillance tech.  It's the WALL that he's throwing his shutdown tantrum over. #TrumpAddress
A LOT of the children Trump's talking about, trying to pull at our heartstrings, are NOT undocumented immigrants -- but kids coming seeking LAWFUL ASYLUM.  Again, he's mixing things up to confuse people and make a case he can't make honestly.  #TrumpAddress
When Trump talks about heroin and illegal drugs coming over the border, he's being misleading.  Vast majority of those drugs come hidden in legal cargo driving across at official checkpoints.  His border wall won't make a damn difference.   #TrumpAddress
Trump just said Border Patrol encounter thousands of undocumented immigrants every year.  That's correct.  Those are the migrants they DEPORT!   In other words, his numbers are based on a SYSTEM THAT WORKS.   #TrumpAddress

Simple fact is EVEN IF you believe Trump‚Äôs anti-immigrant fear mongering, our border is NO LESS SAFE today than for LAST TWO YEARS in which GOP had total control of Congress &amp; didn‚Äôt pass funding for #borderwall. Because sensible Republicans know it‚Äôs a pointless waste of money.

The #ForThePeopleAct put forward by Democrats in the House today would limit the capacity for Republicans *or Democrats* to gerrymander federal Congressional districts!  That‚Äôs what real leadership ‚Äî and accountability ‚Äî looks like!
FYI, House Democrats are yet again putting forward bipartisan solutions to the shutdown that Senate Republicans ALREADY PASSED and Trump supported before he changed his mind. Now Republicans are refusing to even hold a vote		Democrats want solutions. Republicans want a shutdown.

Important to note, as Pelosi did, that proposals for LGBT equality, immigrants rights and more are BIPARTISAN PROPOSALS THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE SUPPORTED.
Prediction: The full magnitude of Trump‚Äôs disastrous lack of leadership wasn‚Äôt visible in last 2 years because GOP Congress was following his mess. Pelosi &amp; Democrats will now be an example of effective leadership ‚Äî for all American people ‚Äî and contrast with Trump will be stark!
Democrats know climate change is real and want to make the planet and its people healthier.		While Trump is literally rolling back regulations to make it easier for big business to pollute our water and air. 		Really. Just sayin.
Pelosi reminding the American people who the Democrats, at their best, stand for ‚Äî the ordinary working people of this country. All of them! 		The more Democrats live up to that core priority, the better our political prospects for the future.

Pelosi saying that each side must stand its ground but all the people who elected them ‚Äî Democrats and Republicans ‚Äî deserve leaders who work to find common ground.
Congratulations Speaker Pelosi ‚Äî not only one of the most effective women leaders in American political history but one of the most effective leaders, period. üí•
Trump‚Äôs shutdown is basically a temper tantrum. 		Except instead of throwing toys, he‚Äôs throwing around 800,000 working folks‚Äô livelihoods. 		And as the grownups in Washington, Pelosi and Schumer should know better than to give into tantrums.
In flush times (as in Clinton presidency) there‚Äôs an argument to be made for #paygo. But esp in an fragile economy that still may need stimulating, silly for Dems to hamstring themselves ‚Äî and voluntarily embrace neo-liberal economics amidst universal cry for populism

Talk about the difference public schools or food stamps made in your life and why you worry about steep tax cuts to public services.

So yes you need to be part of the response to that strategy, standing up for and defending the communities they attack.  And, if you choose, you can also help unravel that strategy, one person at a time. Starting with your own family. ‚Å£	‚Å£
The people who vote out of fear and resentment and hate aren‚Äôt inherently that way.  They‚Äôre the products of that strategy. ‚Å£‚Å£
... including being shaped by, for instance, a right-wing political party in this country that for the last 60+ years has systematically stoked fear and resentment and hate as an explicit political strategy.

Fox just ran an add from America First Policies about Trump's NAFTA replacement, which I suspect is going to have a tough time getting through GOP controlled Senate -- and, prediction, will be first Trump "deal" he gets through Democrat-controlled House
Okay, okay.... @IngrahamAngle just made point that basically, sure, we should be worried about white nationalists and hate which is problem for Republicans BUT "Democrats are overplaying their hands" and to prove her point, Ingraham plays clip of @NicolleDWallace, ahem REPUBLICAN
Is there a drinking game about watching Fox News and taking a drink each time an anchor or commentator boasts how early on they predicted Trump would become president?  Cuz there should be....
@CNNJason Imagine when I worked there...
Just sitting here stress eating all the food in a 10 mile radius.
Fox.  News.  Anchors.  Are.  Complaining.  THAT DEMOCRATS ARE DE-LEGITIMIZING TRUMP!?!?!?!?!?!?!
The hypocrisy and contradictions are maddening.  And the fact that people are flocking to the cult of Trump not just to fall for his lies, but because of them!?!  That just hurts my heart.
Anyone else remember when Hannity and Limbaugh and others condemned Obama's messiah complex!??!?!?!?!
Ingraham just cut to Rush Limbaugh...  who just mocked the media and Democrats for saying Trump and the right is divisive and says "Democrats still haven't accepted that they lost the election."		THEN, on cue, Limbaugh bashes Hillary... so who still thinks it's 2016?
Ingraham gives Trump a report card.  Mostly As and Bs... she's obviously grading on a curve.
Ingraham is running through a list of things that Trump has "accomplished" -- and, for good measure, blaming Democrats for there not being an immigration solution and accusing DEMOCRATS wanting to keep the issue alive!
And now I'm still watching @FoxNews because I'm a glutton.  Hey @IngrahamAngle
Ingraham: The American people are desperate for calm and unity... What message do you have for them?		Hannity translated the question to Trump.		Trump answered something about how economic success will lead to unity but I didn't follow because my head was exploding.
Hannity: You missed my opening monologue.		Trump: No I didn't, I saw it on the plane... I never miss your monologue.		This is actually happening.
Trump just said that the polls had him loosing "because of the fake news"
Hannity says he was signing #MAGA hats around #MAGArally during his supposed "news" coverage of Trump....
Almost too much to respond to but... the Trump line just now, "You cannot let this guy be governor" about Gillum in Florida, as opposed to DeSantis who is "hard worker" and a "good guy"
Now @realDonaldTrump and @seanhannity citing biased data talking about supposed cost of undocumented immigrants, data that DOES NOT include the economic benefits and growth:  https://t.co/jrKCNZcvzI
"We have a barbed wire wall." -- @realDonaldTrump on @seanhannity on @FoxNews saying the military is in effect now building the wall
Trump now flagrantly lying that the economy was headed south when he took over.
Both @seanhannity and @JudgeJeanine keep saying that the people in Missouri, esp the people at the #MAGArally, are good people, hardworking people... plainly implying the people everywhere else, and esp the people voting Democrat, are not.  COME ON!
Hey @seanhannity while we're talking... I thought @nbcsnl sketch mocking Dan Crenshaw was OFFENSIVE AND WRONG.  There.  	Also, I thought @realDonaldTrump mocking disabled reporter Serge Kovaleski was offensive and wrong, too.  Care to comment?
Also, I know it's been said before, but this is really it -- @seanhannity broadcasting from @realDonaldTrump's #MAGArally, not just covering it but HYPING IT, pumping up the crowd, etc... Fox News really now is operating as the TV arm of Trump's government.
It's just FASCINATING to watch @seanhannity say on the one hand how much of a victim Trump is of the media, how his supporters are the "invisible" and "forgotten" people and THEN TURN AROUND and say how Democrats are the ones who play victim.
I'm watching @seanhannity on @FoxNews right now because apparently I want to punish myself.
Duuuuuuuuuude. It‚Äôs a video game. And it was a joke. Wow. https://t.co/a6dnC5MjhG
Since Trump so brazenly lying about what Democrats want, here are some lies about Republicans:		- They want to take away your health care	- They want to privatize and cut your Social Security	- They want to let big business polite your air and water		Oh wait, those are all true!
Feels like one of the more noteworthy trends of this election cycle is how pretty much every analyst or commentator in the media noting that polls are sometimes wrong. Welcome change! Polls don‚Äôt vote. People do!

There are practical reasons for civility and radical kindnesses and respect ‚Äî because I‚Äôve never met anyone who changed their mind because they were hated into it. I‚Äôm talking here esp about ‚Äúleaders‚Äù but followers.  When they feel personally attacked, their minds close more.
Your principles are your principles no matter what. And I‚Äôm a progressive because I believe in the equality and dignity of all people, INCLUDING those who deny my equality or humanity. I don‚Äôt do that because it‚Äôs easy but because it‚Äôs right.
Yesterday @EricHolder said the Dem‚Äôs saying should be ‚ÄúWhen they go low, we kick them.‚Äù		The day before @HillaryClinton said ‚Äúyou cannot be civil‚Äù with the Republican Party today. 		I respect both of them but respectfully disagree. We cannot let our opposition define our values!

[Spoiler: If you think a qualified Supreme Court justice lies under oath, hides 93% of his record, believes in unlimited &amp; unaccountable presidential power, *and* is an extremist right wing ideologue who may have committed sexual assault, then Kavanaugh is your guy I guess.] https://t.co/hgsmnOpjTo
This is not a trial, it‚Äôs a JOB INTERVIEW!		The issue isn‚Äôt whether Kavanaugh is innocent or guilty, but WHETHER HE‚ÄôS QUALIFIED OR NOT!  		And the BURDEN IS ON HIM to show he is technically and ethically qualified.
RT @falisha95672850: @twopiece55 @sallykohn It‚Äôs a job interview not a trial.
@RealKiraDavis 7 years in prison when falsely accused is definitively different than one week of questioning when you‚Äôre up for a lifetime Supreme Court post, no?
All men do NOT commit sexual assault, ffs, and suggesting otherwise is what contributes to a climate of excusing and minimizing assault in general! #TrumpPressconference
Trump just	used	the word	TRAUMA	to describe what KAVANAUGH has been through?!??  		I cannot even begin with how warped and WRONG this is, whatever you believe.
‚ÄúThe women of our country want security‚Äù says Trump.		My congratulations to all the late night writers whose jobs just got easier tonight
On #NewNafta to be clear, this has always been Trump‚Äôs real danger ‚Äî a hint of the actual economic populism our country needs and the people want, but paired with ugly and dangerous hate mongering and exclusionary social policies. #nafta
RT @NewYorker: ‚ÄúI thought it was going to be an investigation,‚Äù a Yale classmate of Brett Kavanaugh and Deborah Ramirez said, of the F.B.I.‚Ä¶
Again you can read Lori Wallach / @PCGTW full statement here: https://t.co/Z1Ud3tBsrJ		And they‚Äôll be posting even more detailed analysis soon. #nafta #NewNafta
‚ÄúFailed U.S. trade policies that have dramatically boosted corporate power and harmed workers, consumers and the environment require a complete transformation.‚Äù
‚ÄúNew monopoly privileges for pharmaceutical firms added to the deal could undermine reforms needed to make medicine more affordable here and increase prices in Mexico and Canada, limiting access to lifesaving medicines.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut despite Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúBuy American/Hire American‚Äù rhetoric, the new deal maintains NAFTA‚Äôs waiver of Buy American rules that require the U.S. government to procure U.S.-made goods, which would mean more outsourced U.S. tax dollars and jobs.‚Äù
‚ÄúRules of origin that allowed goods with significant Chinese and others non-North American value were tightened.‚Äù
‚ÄúTerms that forced countries to continue to export natural resources that they seek to conserve are eliminated. Longstanding safety and environmental problems relating to Mexican-domiciled trucks‚Äô access to U.S. roads are addressed.‚Äù
‚ÄúAreas of progress include a first-time-ever innovation of conditioning trade benefits for a percentage of autos and auto parts on the workers producing them being paid $16 per hour or more.‚Äù
‚ÄúImportant progress has been made with the removal of investment terms that help outsource jobs and a dramatic reining-in of NAFTA‚Äôs outrageous corporate Investor State Dispute Settlement tribunals under which corporations have grabbed hundreds of millions from taxpayers...‚Äù
‚ÄúMore work remains to be done. Unless there are strong labor and environmental standards that are subject to swift and certain enforcement, U.S. firms will continue to outsource jobs to pay Mexican workers poverty wages, dump toxins and bring their products back here for sale.‚Äù
Just gonna quote trade guru Lori Wallach of @PCGTW statement on #NewNafta because it‚Äôs helpful analysis and most folks won‚Äôt click thru #Nafta #thread
I‚Äôve always said if Trump does something worth praising, I‚Äôll praise him. #NAFTA was horrible for workers in all 3 countries and a boon to global corporations.

AND perhaps even worse, in their handling of these allegations and flagrant dismissal and condescension toward Kavanaugh‚Äôs accusers, have sent a clear signal to American women that if they speak out about sexual assault, they will be disrespected, attacked and smeared.
Grassley, Hatch, Graham and others have made clear that they don‚Äôt care, they‚Äôre going to push to confirm him anyway ‚Äî even going so far as to say EVEN IF Kavanaugh did these things he‚Äôs a ‚Äúgood guy‚Äù now
4. What‚Äôs at issue here is whether Republicans continue to support Kavanaugh even with these allegations and whether they will give any consideration to facts surfaced in an investigation....
3. @RichLowry is right. I opposed Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination before any allegations came out. And no FBI investigation or other information will change that. I think he‚Äôs a dangerous ideologue, hid his full record from the Senste &amp; made mult inconsistent statements in his testimony.
2.  Affidavits presumably produced at the request of Kavanaugh‚Äôs legal team saying you don‚Äôt remember an event are NOT the same as saying it didn‚Äôt happen ‚Äî and do not replace an actual investigations, incl those persons being asked questions.
Now let‚Äôs address the substance of what @RichLowry alleged... 		1. What we can all be certain of is that we don‚Äôt have all the facts re Ford‚Äôs allegations or others. That‚Äôs why an investigation is important. https://t.co/kCRpxVJoBM

That's all I've got for #adviceforgoodmen -- hope it was vaguely helpful.  And a chance to say THANK YOU to the men who support survivors and stand against shaming and blaming women.  Meanwhile, I'll try to follow the hashtag and post some of the other responses!
Final #adviceforgoodmen esp re Kavanaugh, is say something like this: "I don't know what actually happened and who to believe, we need to investigate and listen, but I do know what Ford and Ramirez are alleging is serious and awful and happens way to often to too many women."
#adviceforgoodmen 6: Try to take your identity off the table.  If you're a guy &amp; some guy is being accused of sexual assault, you don't have to defend him because you're a guy. BUT if you automatically defend him, THAT'S where the "all men" perception comes from ‚Äî ur fanning it.
#adviceforgoodmen 5: Err on the side of support, not skepticism.  We know that only 2% of rape and sexual assault claims are found to be false (the same rates as for other reported crimes) and the pressures against accusers, especially women, speaking out publicly are tremendous
#adviceforgoodmen 4: Focus on the accused and what he/she did or did not do, not the character, behavior, past, etc., of the accuser.  Don't shame or blame the accuser.  Make accusers feel safe and supported ‚Äî and heroic for speaking up, because they are.
#adviceforgoodmen 3: If noting they're just allegations, you can also point out that the alleged behavior is HORRIFIC AND UNACCEPTABLE. Even if want to minimize the veracity of the allegations, don't minimize the severity of what's being alleged. "If this is true, it's awful"
Cites for last tweet https://t.co/e1vNzFBGj0 and https://t.co/43PEwlrxlj
#adviceforgoodmen 2: When talking about allegations of sexual assault or harassment,  acknowledge the broader context ‚Äî the reality that 1 in 6 American women will be subject to rape or attempted rape in their lifetimes, 81% of women have experienced sexual harassment
#adviceforgoodmen 1:  GOOD FOR ASKING FOR HELP!  Part of misogynistic culture is that men intuitively learn how to be part of the problem but don't learn how to be part of the solution.  Earnestly asking questions and wanting to help is an important place to start.
"... You don't owe me any advice on this but I just thought I'd drop the hint that men may not deserve guidance but we do need it...."		And so... I have a few thoughts on #adviceforgoodmen but would love others to weigh in too.
"... The question for me which I wish someone could write extensively about is exactly how a man deals with a situation in which he does not believe a claim without subsequently harming the many women quietly keeping abuse to themselves who may see his public doubts...."
He wrote:	"Struggling with all of this. I have to say that I have serious doubts about these accusers but I've limited my criticisms because I don't want to dissuade women from coming forward by publicly blasting someone who did (even if I am struggling to believe them)...."
So I got a private message from a prominent conservative man asking for advice -- which I'm sharing here, with his permission but without attribution... and then I want to offer some thoughts but invite others to do so too!  Let's call it #adviceforgoodmen

The key question is who will Puerto Rico‚Äôs recovery benefit: Big business disaster capitalists? Or the Puerto Rican people! #OurPowerPRnyc
Indeed the government of Puerto Rico has already started pushing charter schools post Hurricane Maria. #OurPowerPRnyc
Many Puerto Rican‚Äôs fear that the delay in reopening schools is also part of a broader agenda to privatize the school system, as happened in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina #OurPowerPRnyc
@rosaclemente Wish. You. Were!
Just one example: Under guise of fighting poverty in 1940s, Puerto Rican‚Äôs were pushed out of small scale sustainable agriculture and into mass mono-culture farming like coffee plantations to serve the United States. #OurPowerPRnyc
Hurricane Maria is a moment for a bold just transition and sustainable economy for Puerto Rico ‚Äî or more of the worst of the past and then some. #OurPowerPRnyc
Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States. Is it now also going to be a territory of disaster capitalism? Or INDEPENDENT! #OurPowerPRnyc
The federal government, along with starved local government, stalling basic recovery in Puerto Rico paves the way for privatization ... intentionally? #OurPowerPRnyc
Puerto Rico has for generations taken out of the hands of Puerto Ricans.  #OurPowerPRnyc envisions disaster recovery that doesn‚Äôt further this abuse but turns it around ‚Äî giving power IN EVERY SENSE to the people of Puerto Rico.

And when I decided to write a book, even though I had left Fox, Ailes contributed a blurb for my book proposal.  Haven't shared it before publicly, but here's what he wrote.  Fitting, for a book about how we can all be kind and we can all be hateful. https://t.co/vHtipIbSKx
Last but not least, as I suggest in my book, people are endlessly complicated.  And Roger Ailes was, to me personally, encouraging and helpful.  He saw my potential, got me on air, and gave me invaluable feedback.
At the same time, I'm mad at myself that I didn't see my brief exchanges with Roger as hints of some broader &amp; far more disturbing behavior. I wish that I had. And, though I was on the fringes during my time at Fox (literally &amp; figuratively) I wish I had known more and done more.
Also, as I told @apalmerdc, I was WAY more thrown and creeped out by all the OTHER THINGS Ailes said... about how Muslims were out to get him, about Obama being a closet anti-American socialist, that sort of thing.
Also though I know what Ailes said to me, and the way he said it, is technically sexual harassment, I think it falls at the pretty low end of the spectrum.  And I never felt threatened nor that my job (contract) was hinging on my response.
Okay so a few more points about this... for the record I DID NOT talk about any of this when @GretchenCarlson @megynkelly and others were speaking out because I didn't want to in any way distract from their infinitely more HARROWING STORIES https://t.co/SHum5FU63s

@BenHowe @chadfelixg Yes. Of course! But as a country one would hope we could do better by our kids, rather than treating the symptoms of rampant gun violence, to instead seriously try to address the problem.
@chadfelixg Speaking for myself, the idea that the only way to keep my kid safe at school is for there to be armed guards and metal detectors is deeply defeatist and deeply sad.
We can honor the Second Amendment and still put the safety of our nation‚Äôs children FIRST.

@JustinTHaskins Boarding a plane but... I see gray area in what you wrote, but certainly appreciate clarification. And apologies for offending you.
@JustinTHaskins Jewish Israelis and Palestinians in West Bank equally support non-violent strategies ... I mean, want me to keep going? Point is, you‚Äôre making an assisting about all/most Palestinians that is not only not true but fuels blanket discrimination and violence.
@JustinTHaskins Higher percent of Palestinians also support two-state solution. And majorities of BOTH sides do... so, again, counters your point.
‚ÄúSupport for the peace process runs a bit deeper among Palestinians than among Jewish Israelis, with a third or more of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip saying they strongly support it, compared with 20% of Jewish Israelis.‚Äù - Gallup, 2013 https://t.co/PA0lYEgh5E https://t.co/PRMDxYsjxh
@chadfelixg Wow. Thanks Chad.
@JustinTHaskins Read my timeline. And talk to my ancestors. 	But the person I was responding to suggested historical rights, thus my analogy.
Last I checked, Trump won a higher percentage of the American vote than Hamas won of the Palestinian vote. And we don‚Äôt think Trump speaks for nor has the support of all Americans, right?

In fact, I am confident that a free and just and safe Palestine is in the best interest of a free and just and safe Israel ‚Äî because apart from the fringe extremes, most everyone on both sides just desperately wants peace.
Look, I understand the history that led my Jewish ancestors to want a safe homeland of their own, but I also believe that it‚Äôs possible to create a Jewish homeland without turning Palestinian homes and homeland into a living hell.
Here, he‚Äôs showing a photograph of a once-vibrant market Hebron that is now an abandoned lot because, due to the occupation, Palestinians are literally barred from this part of their own city.

Though I don‚Äôt think love is the opposite of hate ... you‚Äôll have to read my book to find out why. But still, this quote and this man inspires me and so much in all of us to this day. And reminds us all, in the face of darkness, to be the light. #MLK50 #TheOppositeOfHate
My favorite King quote of all time, which I cite over and over again, is ‚ÄúDarkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.‚Äù  In the rest of the quote, King said, ‚ÄúHate cannot drive out hate;only love can do that.‚Äù #MLK50

Really, @NellSco book #JustTheFunnyParts is hysterical &amp; dishy &amp; also SO SUPREMELY USEFUL in learning about Hollywood &amp; comedy &amp; writing in general buuuuuuuut duh, if you've read Ozzy Ozbourne's genius "I Am Ozzy" you'll realize Nell's book is the 2nd best Hollywood memoir ever
.@NellSco 's line, which really sums it all up ‚Äî "Most Hollywood memoirs dish about celebs doing drugs. I'm going in a different direction." ‚Äî is also only the second funniest line I've ever read.  And, let's be honest, a humor almost too subtle for this moment in history.
Also, look at this list of writing credits on @NellSco ‚Äòs cover. She‚Äôs definitely only the second most accomplished TV comedy writer in history https://t.co/Xl6cNdSBSX

Denver airport really coming alive at this hour...
Also, update, now the crying girl is not crying and she and the one stranger who comforted her are now talking about Colonipin and Xanex.
Now the nice Australian lady is a hit woman?!?? WHAT IS HAPPENING? People, I am NOT going to be able to sleep on the plane.
Ohmigash everyone in this story is bananas!!!!  Sheela is gonna kill Hasia isn‚Äôt she?!?
Okay back to #WildWildCountry ... THEY POISONED THE WHOLE TOWN? why didn‚Äôt anyone explain where The Dalles is but anyway... my compassion for the cult is dwindling. Also the crying girl telling strangers how the boyfriend treated her like crap. So much happening.
Meanwhile a whole other human drama is unfolding real time as a young woman in the airport is in tears because her boyfriend just broke up with her and strangers are comforting her and people are really wonderful
WAIT THEN THEY POISONED ALL THE HOMELESS PEOPLE?!??? This is bonkers.
And so many fascinating through lines but I especially watch community attack on sexual lib cult in context of Oregon‚Äôs eventual anti-gay ballot measure in 1992
Also when you google why the Rajneesh wear maroon, and why they changed to maroon in Oregon from orange in India, you get this https://t.co/CRp1l6A1Gn
Okay... I‚Äôm gonna just watch #WildWildCountry for two hours while I wait for my flight. I‚Äôm obsessed (thanks @SophiaBush ) and 2.5 episodes in, I‚Äôm 60% rooting for the cult, but feel conflicted about how they gave homes to homeless (good) to commit election fraud basically (bad)
@BradWollack There‚Äôs that. üòòüòòüòò
@2babyroses Best idea yet
@BradWollack Ooooooh you missed the whole effing saga. Flight home (direct) delayed like 6 hrs so I changed flights... and now get home at 5:00am... an hour later than the delayed flight. Yay me

Of. Course. There. Is. 	I did not mean they‚Äôre the same and didn‚Äôt mean to suggest that. And apologize to @ParkerMolloy and others. https://t.co/haQzpNr0A0
I‚Äôm a progressive because I believe in redemption ‚Äî and progress!
Geez internet. I just said that someone I called out for bad behavior apologized and I forgive her. That‚Äôs that. I‚Äôll do me. You do you.
@mnolt87 @gaybonez @ParkerMolloy Good point. Not saying it was a perfect apology.
@ParkerMolloy No. I do not believe they are the same. And you know that. 	I do believe, however, that we can all choose whether we take others at their word OR believe those on ‚Äúour side‚Äù are the only well-intentioned people
I hear YOU! But I‚Äôve seen neo-Nazis become fighters for equality and terrorists become pacifists so I believe in change. And I want to encourage people to do the right thing, even in small ways, not treat them as endemically hopeless https://t.co/vuLV1DKKCZ
@BenHowe Good luck!
@gaybonez @ParkerMolloy Totally agree. But again, you would have preferred no apology?
So once evil, always evil? You write her off permanently? She can never do anything decent in your mind ever? https://t.co/GHruLkR0lS
@ParkerMolloy Sheesh ok. I wasn‚Äôt quite tweeting you to be aggressive or anything just because I thought you made an interesting point and wanted everyone to see it
@RachelLarris Explain
Also, when I‚Äôm criticizing someone for being cruel, I make a point of trying to be extra kind ‚Äî not even more cruel than the person I‚Äôm criticizing.
I work for social change. And social change isn‚Äôt possible if people don‚Äôt change. And I want to create the conditions and allow for the possibility for people to change. And praise them when they change. Even just in small ways.
Reminds me of when someone says something homophobic or such... but then later changes and apologizes. But some people won‚Äôt let them change and keep bringing it up. So what you‚Äôre signaling is you‚Äôd rather them *stay* homophobic?!?
What an extraordinary thing to assert. 	Curious, were you critical of people who attacked @davidhogg111 as ‚Äúacting‚Äù? But now you‚Äôre accusing @IngrahamAngle ‚Äôs apology of being fake? https://t.co/F0g1DSQBSC

Good one to end with https://t.co/B7zkUy4J4A
Perhaps, but in the political sense in which you‚Äôre using it, the way we define who is ‚Äúabusing‚Äù us is shaped by partisan bias https://t.co/Ig60SSJrym
All of which shows the double standard we ALL apply, giving *our own people* a pass while holding the *other side* to higher scrutiny. We all do it. And it‚Äôs always wrong.
Another point: This is all sickly clouded by partisanship. The same people who want to take Trump at his word that he‚Äôs not an anti-Semite don‚Äôt want to believe a progressive activist that she‚Äôs not an anti-Semite
I think hate is a problem for **all of us** AND we need to learn how to engage hate in all forms and degrees in a way that shows people kindness and compassion and an alternative ‚Äî versus just using the hate of others to perpetuate more hate
It‚Äôs worth noting that many white conservatives feel alienated by progressives for what they see as a holier-than-thou attitude about certain kinds of hate ‚Äî either you‚Äôre with us or you‚Äôre a monster and I‚Äôm not even engaging with you
We can‚Äôt say we want people to have compassion for us and not HATE US and then at the same time HATE THEM because of their views. That‚Äôs counterproductive. And hypocritical.
No free passes being given. At all. Hold people accountable AND still strive to be loving and compassionate https://t.co/hK7NmK0usS
@george_revutsky @HLNTV @CarolHLN @PopChassid As I said, I and others did criticize her for it. So that‚Äôs what you want, right? But then she releases a statement clarifying she doesn‚Äôt support those hateful views and you want HIS words to speak for Tamika vs HER OWN WORDS?!?
@Halfpintmonkey @kamanda_shetani @BarthLago @jamesavis1988 @RealChalamet Oh wow fascinating really?
@JohnDoe5071991 @TamikaDMallory I‚Äôm wearing a Malcolm X hat at this very moment. I thought he was a great leader. DOES NOT mean I agree with or support 100% of what he said/did. Maybe you should take my word for my beliefs?
This is a good moment to note that I‚Äôm at the airport early and so scrolling through some of my mentions and might be needing some of these https://t.co/B8OuVqlpLy
@zebrandoz @HLNTV @CarolHLN @PopChassid What on God‚Äôs green Earth are you talking about?!???
@jblarson @TamikaDMallory Do you agree 100% with every single thing all your friends do?!	I said I wish she hadn‚Äôt done the photo, tweet etc. AND she released a clear statement about HER beliefs.  End of discussion.

Just wanna day that whole I understand the cultural pressure that makes women get plastic surgery, as long as women ‚Äî especially women in Hollywood ‚Äî keep getting plastic surgery, those pressures will never go away. They set the standards for all of us.
I suspect all the straight white dudes in my feed criticizing the importance of inclusive representation might feel very differently if they hadn‚Äôt grown up almost entirely watching straight white male role models represented all around them
