Trump‚Äôs nominee to lead the EPA - Andrew Wheeler - faces a Senate Environment committee confirmation vote Tuesday. @SenatorCarper @SenDuckworth please ask about the installation of industry shills like Dunlap. This deregulation is going to kill people.
The administration has been taking a ‚Äúhands-off approach to the chemicals, which are appearing in drinking water supplies across the country to rising public alarm. Known as polyfluoroalkyl substances, the chemicals have been linked with kidney and testicular cancer.‚Äù
Dunlap has been ‚Äúoverseeing a central part of EPA's work that could impose cleanup costs on companies that have used the chemicals, including major Koch subsidiary Georgia-Pacific.‚Äù
The Trump Admin is poisoning our water from inside the EPA.		Trump installed David Dunlap - an 8-yr Koch Industry official - into a key role that decides how to protect people from industrial pollution. 	https://t.co/RpKqREwJGD

@LJBreedlove @Nanowiz05 @joncoopertweets @taradublinrocks Because the point is to not have to do it. An economic walkout would have economic effects on small &amp; large businesses alike.

@KikiAdine @SpeakerPelosi I wasn‚Äôt disputing the BuzzFeed story. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs ultimately accurate. But American media doesn‚Äôt do nuance very well - and this would have been a messaging gift to the GOP, fitting right into the media/Dem witch hunt narrative. (See Trump‚Äôs tweet this morning.)
@PauletteParis1 @SpeakerPelosi THAT is the million dollar question.
@TrumpsareNazis @PauletteParis1 @SpeakerPelosi Just wait...we're only getting started. :)
@PauletteParis1 @SpeakerPelosi It's expected in the next month or two.
@PauletteParis1 @SpeakerPelosi I have ZERO confidence in the GOP to stand up for America. We need as much ammo as possible, and the Mueller report will be the best tool for applying pressure to Senators. Just think - they have stood by him this whole time. They don't care he's a crook. They. Don't. Care.
@PauletteParis1 @SpeakerPelosi It's really important to understand that we get one shot at impeaching Trump. We have to be sure of a conviction. Impeachment is not a criminal proceeding. We need 67% of the Senate to convict based on what amounts to "gut" about whether Trump has committed high crimes.
@PauletteParis1 @SpeakerPelosi I hear you. It's challenging to wait. But with Cohen and Whitaker testimony upcoming, and the Mueller report coming out all within the next few weeks, there is a lot on the horizon to bring hope.
@TimForgot @PauletteParis1 @SpeakerPelosi word.
@TimForgot @PauletteParis1 @SpeakerPelosi I hear you and agree. I'm not a cultist and concur. My point was that Democratic leadership is privy to way more information than we are.

@ProudResister @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump It's time when there is enough pressure on the corrupt Senate GOP to actually vote to remove him. There was enough evidence in 2017.

Not just unity against something. Unity with a purpose: racial, social &amp; economic justice. We can and must aim higher.
Trump is lying to the public about the ‚Äúdanger‚Äù at our border, demanding that taxpayer money pay for a wall they don‚Äôt want, and depriving thousands families of paychecks they need to get by. 		All for politics. It‚Äôs an abuse of power. 		That‚Äôs an impeachable offense.

@TomPaine1737 They are the same branch. By I get what you mean. I do believe in having a bicameral legislature, I just think that flat apportionment by state with no consideration of population size is an antiquated idea. Meaning of a vote should not vary by an 80:1 ratio between states.
@TomPaine1737 I'm not suggesting that we abolish the Senate.
@TomPaine1737 So California should divide up into 40 states. Got it.
@TomPaine1737 If this were the case, we would have governance that reflects he will of the people.
@TomPaine1737 I understand. But it's dumb, and it has our country by the balls. We should have un-gerrymandered House Districts and proportional representation in the Senate (where the Senate has a lower ratio of Senators-per-capita vs the House and election is statewide vs. by-district).

@B52Malmet @realDonaldTrump @GOP I follow labor market trends very closely (that‚Äôs my field) and the economic trends too. My sense is that when economists finally look back and identify the start of the recession, they will point to Q4 2018.
When the recession hits, @realDonaldTrump will argue that it was destined...that we‚Äôre due for a correction. There‚Äôs some truth to that.
