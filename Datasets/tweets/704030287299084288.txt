@excalibur61 @Evan_McMullin Be careful what you ask for. I just hope you realize that in such a situation, quite a lot of the Republicans would join the Democrats and most of the remaining Republicans would join the new Conservative party, which will likely be MORE nationalist than the GOP ever was.
@thinkB4toolate @IncredulousCiti @Evan_McMullin The Whigs --- and Whig policies --- didn't disappear like the party label did; they split (over slavery) and joined the Democrats and the Republicans.
@ThoseShavers @Evan_McMullin @GOP So what should be done then?
@ryan_trollip @Evan_McMullin Powerful political parties don't ever just disappear into thin air without their ideas being transferred somewhere else. Seriously, be careful what you wish for.
@MuellerTruth @Evan_McMullin Unfortunately for people who believe as you do, political parties don't simply dissolve. They split after internal conflict or merge with another party.
@mlblacy @Evan_McMullin "Mortal enemy"?
@vonchambers @Evan_McMullin Seriously? There have been many literal terrorist organizations that have reformed and become politically powerful. If you think that the GOP (or any U.S. party, frankly) is irreparably corrupt, then you have a very innocent perception of corruption.
