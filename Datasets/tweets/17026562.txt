@yarbro The BOE here where I live is doing quite well.  I think we should be putting the money into further developing and helping public schools to succeed. Leave my County alone! Even the homeschool program is doing great.
@realDonaldTrump All because they won't kiss your arse and actually do their jobs unlike Fox.
Will this also include:	Will you also teach them how to think for one's self, while your teaching these Civics classes or is it going to be all one sided?  I think teaching critical thinking can go along way along with researching for ones self as well as teaching Ethics! https://t.co/F2UlxjZUnO

@JuddLegum So he can murder someone or assault someone and not be indicted?

@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP I thought he was "all about saving American Jobs and Putting American Jobs".  Last time I look we are not China?

@realDonaldTrump Why don't you explain all the taxpayer money that you are spending at your golf clubs and hotels. I believe you are spending over your yearly donated income. While your businesses are making a big profit.  Stealing from Taxpayers you are!!
@SenSchumer @SenateMajLdr @realDonaldTrump Protect Mueller, Protect Rosenstein, Protect the Investigation. There is either something there or not.  I believe it all comes down to the Money and @realDonaldTrump  is hiding it by obstruction and @SenateMajLdr  is protecting @DevinNunes  and Trump and others. SHAME ON YOU.
@realDonaldTrump Tell that to the @GM employee's that are losing their jobs.
@realDonaldTrump Did you really have to spend more TAXPAYER Money to go to FL your golf club to have this meeting?  Ummm NO.  Tired of you spending our dollar's for your business.
@SenateMajLdr @TeamCavuto @FoxNews WE are seeing you and your lies.  Tell the employee's of @GM how this tax cut/reform is helping them.

@realDonaldTrump Talk about being a liar, a lowlife ( p*ssy grabbing ) Unethical, dirtbag.. Look in the mirror. You are at the top of the list of being the TOP LIAR of our Nation.  Obstructionist is what you are.  BIG FAT LIAR.

@DianeBlackTN You do NOTE have my vote. IF all you care about is party line and can't buck party line when an issue would be good for Tennessee then don't deserve to be Governor. I want someone for all Tennesseans. NOT JUST PARTY OR  @realDonaldTrump MOUTHPIECE.
@RepDianeBlack @StateDept @TGowdySC Can't wait to NOT VOTE FOR YOU. If your all about party line politics then you are not a good choice for Tennessee. We need leaders that can see both sides of an issue and sometimes buck their own party.. THAT IS NOT YOU.

@SenateMajLdr @POTUS @USDOL You and the GOP are just as guilty. So tired of the obstruction all due to party lines.  The Americn People deserve better from our lawmakers and soon you all will hear us loud and clear.
@SenAlexander Americans deserve for their Lawmakers to stand up for the RULE OF LAW.  What are you doing to protect the investigation into what happened during the last election.  Protect Mueller and Rosenstein.
@randyboyd I sought you out to see what you had to say as I make up my mind for who I want to vote for and then I saw this.  Now your on the bottom along with @DianeBlackTN and @VoteMarsha . NEVER EVER. Will you earn my vote Randy?
@VoteMarsha Never @MarshaBlackburn for Senate! As a Tennessean, I don't want someone who is all about Party Lines.
@realDonaldTrump This has nothing to do with Dem's  it's all about you and your campaigne. If you didn't know you sure surrounded yourself with corrupt people that hurts you.  It wasn't the dems.
@MoveOn Just registered in my little town in TN.  Where I will not vote for @DianeBlackTN or @VoteMarsha this election.. They are about @realDonaldTrump and not for the American People.  They are about being a mouth piece and not for Tennessean's. We all aren't about party Lines.

@HathawayHeidi @RonWyden @realDonaldTrump Our lawmakers need to speak up to Trump.  What he did was manipulate the stock market.  He is the leader of this country and HE should never attack an American Country.  Where is the SEC? Mr. @RonWyden ?
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS For you to say that You have been tougher on Russia then anyone is absurd! For you to call people stupid that don't believe that is just idiotic. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU AND I am FAR from being stupid.  I just know you are a liar!
@RonWyden @realDonaldTrump How much did someone with a 401K lose yesterday?  Several 1,000 if you have over 100,000 in your account.  I think @realDonaldTrump needs to pay that back to people.
@CNN Evidence, @realDonaldTrump show me evidence. ANYTHING you say needs to be backed up with cold straight facts.  Oh and not from your Fox N Friends. Pure black and white on paper fully vetted Evidence!!
@CNN In truth he is messing with 100's of thousands of jobs, for the Postal Service, for Amazon and all the support inbetween. I know alot of people who work for both.  Not to mention all those who invest in the stock market, 401k's.  He really is an idiot.

@SenatorDurbin If this happens then I see no reason that the Time Warner and ATT merger shouldn't happen either.   Trump doesn't want that to happen because he wants to see the sell of CNN.  Why because he can't handle truth, only he can handle being stroked by those who boosts his ego.

@AC360 The have not done due diligence, they have cowered. They sit at the throne of @realDonaldTrump waiting for him to thrown them a bone.  They serve the American People not their party but @DevinNunes  WE SEE YOU ALL.
@RepAdamSchiff Thanks for keeping up Mr. Schiff. The American People are not stupid. The GOP forget they work for us.  They haven't done their job. They have just sucked to @realDonaldTrump so he'll do their bidding as they sold their souls to them @DevinNunes I really mean you. WE SEE YOU.

@SpeakerRyan No one can live even at 40hrs on 7something an hr. Where is the raise in min wage.  They say in my state of Tn that a person needs to make at least 14.86 an hour to afford 2 bed.  Everything goes up and up and living wage never rises. You and Congress as a whole is a joke!
@DianeBlackTN @realDonaldTrump Everytime I see this ad, I mute you N say a few colorful words. I don't want a mouthpiece for trump being governor of this state and neither does my conservative father. I'll listen to the rest of the canidates but not You. #NeverDianeBlackforTNGovernor

@RepSwalwell And if @POTUS44 had done anything, just think how loud and disruptive things would have been coming out of @realDonaldTrump mouth. Oh wait he did that his whole campaigne. The buck stops with Trump now!
