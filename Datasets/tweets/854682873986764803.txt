@kojoshow sports bars are more than just identify w/sports teams or cities, it’s also about communities coming together, such as @NelliesDC and @PitchersDC both LGBTQ sports bars. I love watching everything from the World Cup to the State of the Union with my community.
@allinsea @colonialpanic Perfect, I posted a Kojo link for you to listen when you have some time.
@allinsea @colonialpanic @kojoshow https://t.co/LEpWPcLuNY take a listen to Kojo’s Politics hour from last week. Very informative.
@allinsea @colonialpanic Honestly, I’m just at lunch and just happened to notice something, and made a comments no fighting. I’m bowing out of this conversation. Have a great day everyone!
@colonialpanic @allinsea I’m not looking to argue about anything. It’s just a false statement to show the success of something when many are getting paid to be there.
@allinsea @colonialpanic And that’s great, but we need to acknowledge that it’s easy to mobilize people when there is a dollar incentive. It’s $3 per valid signature.
@colonialpanic @allinsea And also, I listened to the @kojoshow and most of the money spent is on petition collectors. Also, every petitioner I’ve met on the street (4 in total) have not been DC residents.
@colonialpanic @allinsea “I’ve never seen anything like the outreach mustered around this. It’s astonishingly impressive quick-turnaround mobilization.” Implies that its a grassroots movement
@colonialpanic @allinsea I am aware of petitioning in DC. I’m just saying that you can’t say “look at all these people who are out doing things for what they believe” when it’s their job. Not residents. 	I’m not saying it’s wrong, but it’s misleading to measure its success based on how many collectors
@colonialpanic @allinsea My point is that if people are going to use the number of signature collectors as a measurement of how much momentum there for this, then it’s a false &amp; misleading statement. It just proves to how much money they have to pay ppl to collect signatures. Most of them aren’t from DC
@allinsea Aren’t most of these people paid?

@AmplyHigh @JasonAndrean @CallieKozlak School safety is a top priority. 		since Congress has sidelined DC’s efforts to curb gun violence, it’s important to reach out to our parents about the importance of gun safety and children. 		Community engagement and education is key to reducing this kind of incident.

@BeltwayGreg @saveourtips @NO2DC77 @councilofdc One can argue that 77 never should have been on the ballot. 		I’m not a legal expert either, so I cannot decided if 77 is constitutional.

@BryanWeaverDC @maustermuhle @peterkrupa @NoCongressRep One of the biggest issues we need to tackle  here in #Ward1 is green spaces and making DC a truly livable city from birth to old age. Green spaces &amp; places for children are critical for a thriving community.
Workers have a right to earn a livable wage, paid family leave, etc., but this initiative does not address the largest issues facing the restaurant industry like wage theft and harassment.
To be clear, I am not against the spirit of this initiative. What I want, is to bring all parties together, to come up with legislation that will leave all involved happier and safer than they were before.

@nathanluecking @BrianneKNadeau I believe any good legislation should have a mark-up process and public debates to bring in the most diverse opinions on the issue to come up with the most well-rounded legislation possible that is agreeable to as many as possible.
@nathanluecking @BrianneKNadeau I was a NO voter on 77. However, I do believe in honoring the voters. 	I would support a full repeal, bring all stakeholders to the table, and come up with legislation that would benefit the most amount of people and mitigate any negative repercussions from this initiative...

@LEM413 @AmplyHigh @TheMidlandsDC I think what @AmplyHigh is saying is if the light changes on either side of this intersection because cars tend to gun it once the light turns and don’t acknowledge the crosswalk. Doesn’t matter who is in it, they come full speed ahead.

@plutonomic @JackEvansWard2 We have much larger issues when it comes to disability than the inconvenience of disposable straws.
@plutonomic @JackEvansWard2 I think many people with disabilities would like to have access to buildings in general. DC does a terrible job at equal access for those with wheelchairs, walkers and other assistive devices. If they cannot access the building, then the straw issue is mute...
@plutonomic @JackEvansWard2 And I stand by this quote. 	Reasonable accommodation is an open concept. I am not saying we must take away straws in general, the access is still there. but we must have a more eco friendly option.	But if we are talking about accommodations... (1/2)
@plutonomic @JackEvansWard2 I totally agree. I have friends who need straws in order to consume their drinks. 		There are so many positives to paper straws. They do decompose quickly. I’m not saying it’s a perfect solution, but it is a step in the right direction, and I think this gives room for innovation
@plutonomic @JackEvansWard2 Well, there is no obligation to buy straws. Without this added cost, there would be an instant savings. I honestly don’t think there are really any negative impacts, maybe just a cultural adjustment.
@mindymoretti @plutonomic @Vote4DC It also needs to be witnessed by the candidate. We sign an affidavit to affirm it

@plutonomic @saveourtips @BrianneKNadeau @councilofdc The thing is, tipped workers already make $15/Hour. 	This is an enforcement issue, not a legislative issue. You can’t “stop the will of the people” when it’s already enshrined into law.

@kcivey @cmdgrosso @charlesallen And just to be clear, I’m not against this. 	I just feel we need to realign our priorities.
@kcivey @cmdgrosso @charlesallen Driving is not an impulsive act. We need to have courses, trainings, mentorship hours, permits, fees, licensing. 		And we should ask anyone who voted for 45 if voting is an impulsive act. Many people had a “we’ll see what happens” attitude.
@CMCharlesAllen @kcivey @cmdgrosso @charlesallen I wish I could be there myself today
@kcivey @cmdgrosso @charlesallen My connection is that voting is a huge responsibility. If we are charging 16y/os with this very adult responsibility, wouldn’t it make sense for them to be treated as adults across the spectrum of adult responsibilities?
@kcivey @cmdgrosso @charlesallen ...or the general elections. Disseminating information is critical, and we need to do a better job of doing so, particularly when it coming to housing, health, jobs and voting.
@kcivey @cmdgrosso @charlesallen I was thinking also more broadly when it comes to housing discrination and jobs. 	Also, it’s about disseminating information. Many people are unaware of their right to vote in DC Elections. I met people just this week who thought they could only vote in either the Primary...
While I respect @cmdgrosso &amp; @charlesallen for their enthusiasm, will youths also be tried as adults? Pay taxes like adults? What about our returning citizens &amp; restoring their rights?

@MrDevMyers @councilofdc @cmdgrosso @trayonwhite @BrianneKNadeau However, it is the law that teachers must be licensed. Like it or hate it, it’s the law. If we feel that the law needs to be changed, then lobby for that. But lack of oversight just because you don’t like something is not an excuse.
@plutonomic @KentBoeseDC Oh, I agree. I’m not anti-development at all. I am pro smart development. @BrianneKNadeau has her campaign account lined with developers who’s names now cover the DC Sky lines. Explaining the lack of oversight. It’s a conflict. Hence why I don’t accept corporate contributions.
@kojoshow @ChmnMendelson Let’s be the change we wish to see.
@kojoshow @ChmnMendelson If the DC Dems are as strong as they believe to be, they should have nothing to worry about. Open primaries have, in the long run benefited the left. It’s time we start fighting. For voting rights not just on the Fed level, but for equal representation on the local level as well
@kojoshow @ChmnMendelson I am less concerned about Repubs. and more concerned about Indep. voters who increasingly want to remain neutral at their job. We are disenfranchising a large group of progressives who now have no say in who leads the @councilofdc or any of their local leadership....
@kojoshow @tomsherwood @ChmnMendelson I am running 4 @councilofdc #Ward1 as a Progressive-Indep, and once elected, I will lead the charge to open primaries to ALL residents of DC. In the age of Trump, we shouldn’t be hearing “my vote doesn’t matter”. Will you support me in this?

@plutonomic @SafeSpacesDC @BrianneKNadeau @JessicaLSmith07 @DCPoliceDept So, when facing violence in public, it’s important to remember that there is no “one size fits all” solution to preventing the crime. Singing an unusual song or phrase is used to get people’s attention to the situation.

@AT4DC Perhaps if we opened up primaries to ALL residents of DC, and not just the Democrats, perhaps residents would feel empowered enough to come out and voice their support.
@joeflood What’s Phillips?
@BuildingDC @councilofdc @trayonwhite @tweetelissa 👌🏽
@BuildingDC @councilofdc @trayonwhite @tweetelissa Alright, I am bowing out of this conversation, as you are resorting to name calling, and trolling for a fight. 	Enjoy the rest of your day.
@BuildingDC @councilofdc @trayonwhite @tweetelissa  https://t.co/5ZuM4kMmlT
@BuildingDC @councilofdc @trayonwhite @tweetelissa And if I’m lying (which I’m not), I am at least able to show my face, and not hide behind a twitter handle.
@BuildingDC @councilofdc @trayonwhite @tweetelissa Don’t remember a whole rally outside the Wilson Building? A member of the Mayor’s staff resigned because of it. 	The rally was held to support CM White. And after the comments were made about @tweetelissa, White was silent on the issue.
@BuildingDC @councilofdc @trayonwhite @tweetelissa So even worse! He’s calling women, in particular women of color animals?? Your argument is weak my friend.
@BuildingDC @councilofdc @trayonwhite @tweetelissa At time :48 he says: “because they are partly animals”

@BillOReilly Yup! I sure would!
@BuildingDC @councilofdc @trayonwhite @tweetelissa Please note: I said @trayonwhite is pushing #Farrakahn ‘s comments. I never said he made those comments. #contextmatters
@timkrepp Oh no, I didn’t mean to imply that at all. I was just saying that I’m happy to discuss my views on it
@timkrepp As a fellow Independent voter, YES there is reason to vote! 		77 is an incredibly important issue.	I will be voting NO on 77, and I’m happy to chat with you as to why I am doing so.

@riotpedestrian @samknight_one @Pashovski Nope, never said that.
@riotpedestrian @samknight_one @Pashovski Haha! Logic? Opinion.
@samknight_one @Pashovski @riotpedestrian Mmhumm... okay.
@riotpedestrian @samknight_one @Pashovski I don’t. I’ve already admitted that. So now I’m asking evidence to the contrary. I want to be well informed, but apparently your friend wants to leave me in the dark and not share his wealth of knowledge.
@samknight_one @Pashovski @riotpedestrian Nope, you asked for evidence for LGBTQ People who are servers, bartenders, and other industry workers who will be voting NO. I said I don’t have the evidence. Clearly you do, please, I would like to be more educated.
@samknight_one @riotpedestrian I said I don’t. Tag! You’re it to share your wealth of knowledge!
@Pashovski @samknight_one @riotpedestrian Ah, name calling is mature and only used when there is nothing more intelligent to say. It’s cute.
@samknight_one @riotpedestrian I am also asking for your help in my understanding. If there is data on this issue with LGBTQ people, I’m happy to read it. I already said I have the data and since you’re the numbers person, I would love to see what you have to back your claim that VOTE NO is “lies”.
@samknight_one @riotpedestrian Also, you must have some kind of information that I do not. Mind sharing your empirical data with me? Maybe you can change my mind?
@samknight_one @riotpedestrian Their thoughts on the issue whenever I go out, and overwhelmingly they are opposed to it. I even ask if this was THEIR answer or their bosses’, and they all say it’s their own.
@samknight_one @riotpedestrian As far as the demographic of LGBTQ servers, no. there is no data that I know of that suggests this. However, I know my community, I know my Ward, and I too have worked as a server and bartender the majority of my life. I have asked most servers and bartenders...(1/2)
@samknight_one @riotpedestrian I’m not, but apparently you are? 		The vote YES people are coming in, and are not from here, giving a misleading initiative that no one here wants. 		Vote NO people are grassroots service industry workers, who came together quickly to launch a campaign. I stand with them.

I have guided my clients through DC Agencies, and dockless is a huge issue for many of my clients. I am ensuring that everyone is safe. The passion behind this is due to the concern of the community...
@JCrawford60 @MrTinDC @riotpedestrian @tuckerhimself @DDOTDC @311DCgov We have many areas of common ground, but I won’t support dockless. 	I have said my peace, I wish you all a great day.
@JCrawford60 @MrTinDC @riotpedestrian @tuckerhimself @DDOTDC @311DCgov Please read previous comments. It’s not that I don’t care about infrastructure and innovative transportation, but this issue in particular concerns me. 	Everyone here is ignoring the fact that I do care about transit deeply but there is ONE issue that I have that I cannot support
@councilofdc @BrianneKNadeau Ah, then we know it’s an election year.
I am not a Rep, but as some1 running for @councilofdc the lack of action from @BrianneKNadeau and CMs is disturbing. @JackEvansWard2 @tweetelissa @RobertWhite_DC @VoteAnitaBonds @ChmnMendelson @marycheh @CMBrandonTodd @KenyanForWard5 @charlesallen @trayonwhite @VinceGrayWard7 https://t.co/ddHwVsImss

@riotpedestrian @MrTinDC @tuckerhimself @DDOTDC @311DCgov Alright, I’m bowing out of this conversation. Enjoy your day.
@MrTinDC @riotpedestrian @tuckerhimself @DDOTDC @311DCgov How many times do I need to say this? I’m not talking about cars or anything else. Please stay focused on the topic at hand
@MrTinDC @riotpedestrian @tuckerhimself @DDOTDC @311DCgov As I’ve mentioned before, numerous times, it’s all people I know personally. It’s not my responsibility to report these types of issues. Not to mention they happened within the past couple months, so even if these stats were out there, probably not publicly available.
@riotpedestrian @MrTinDC @tuckerhimself @DDOTDC @311DCgov So how many more people need to get hurt in order to measure success?
@MrTinDC @riotpedestrian @tuckerhimself @DDOTDC @311DCgov It’s terrible that the people who this really impacts rarely have access to Twitter and are not able to properly advocate for themselves. This is the largest reason that I am running for office; to ensure every resident has a voice. That not only the squeaky wheels get the oil.
@riotpedestrian @MrTinDC @tuckerhimself @DDOTDC @311DCgov So, you think that will stop people from being careless?
@riotpedestrian @MrTinDC @tuckerhimself @DDOTDC @311DCgov What’s the solution? Please remind me again, because I don’t recall a solution being proposed. I have offered one; I’ve asked for these bikes and scooters to be docked so they are safe and out of the way of people who have the right to an accessible side walk.
RT @jilevin: Please…just pull yourself together! https://t.co/zIzHs6rB8l
@riotpedestrian @MrTinDC @tuckerhimself @DDOTDC @311DCgov I have to disagree. The Deaf-Blind, Blind, Elderly, those with walkers, wheel chairs, severe weakness, mothers, cannot move these bikes carelessly left by careless users. While there are many obstacles in their way, having these thrown around only makes matters worse for them.
@riotpedestrian @MrTinDC @tuckerhimself @DDOTDC @311DCgov No, totally missing the point.	I can’t and won’t support dockless. I’m sorry, but it’s the right thing to do. 	Alright, have a good night, and I hope you all can look at the broader picture and see those who are most vulnerable.
@MrTinDC @riotpedestrian @tuckerhimself @DDOTDC @311DCgov Yet again, I’m not talking about Cars, trucks or anything of that kind. This is not a competition as to what is more dangerous. I’m speaking to **ONE** aspect of travel in this thread.
@tuckerhimself @riotpedestrian @DDOTDC @311DCgov Also, this is NOT about cars. I am talking about dockless devices only. Cars are a whole other issue
@tuckerhimself @riotpedestrian @DDOTDC @311DCgov Just because someone hasn’t been killed yet, doesn’t mean it’s not dangerous. Think about this logic and apply it to other situations. When they are misplaced, they are very dangerous for many demographics of people. Again, I am PRO ridesharing, I’m anti-dockless

@riotpedestrian @DDOTDC @311DCgov I never said cars aren’t an issue. I am making a small statement on a small part of our larger infrastructure, which happens to be dockless transit, which I hope is just a fad. I support the bike and scooter sharing, but they need to be docked.
@riotpedestrian @DDOTDC @311DCgov I sometimes scratch my head over all your posts talking about safety, yet when I bring up dockless bikes and how I have document cases of clients being hurt by them, you disagree with me.

@MyTakeOnThis61 @PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump @KatrinaPierson Woah, that’s not a cool statement.
@PARISDENNARD @realDonaldTrump @KatrinaPierson Paris, you’re smart and I listen to you often, but you honestly believe half the things you say? You know this is a corrupt presidency and you know so much of what is going on is wrong. Why do you continue to discredit yourself in the eyes of the public?

@riotpedestrian I never said they weren’t. This isn’t a pie, and I’m not saying that one issue is more important than the other. What I’m saying is that I want all forms of transit to be safe and accessible to everyone.
@riotpedestrian That’s true, because I have Deaf/Blind clients who are consistently getting hurt by careless people. As someone who talks about bike lanes being blocked and things not being accessible, I feel like that would also be a priority. To find a way to make sure that all ppl are safe.

@p8riot @Conservamator @ScottWalker @johnestrada Yup, meddling that soon will show how deeply intrenched the GOP is with collusion with the Russians. Also, I am running to become a law maker here in the District of Columbia, so yes, my interest lies with the people of my jurisdiction.
@Conservamator @ScottWalker @johnestrada Conservatives want to delegitimize  my marriage, deport my friends and family and to tell women how to treat their bodies. Dems are providing access to healthcare, providing religious and personal liberty and ensuring equal protection under the law.
@Conservamator @p8riot @ScottWalker @johnestrada Not at all, read my whole statement. Don’t pick@and choose what you want to read
@p8riot @Conservamator @ScottWalker @johnestrada #historicalcontext #TheMoreYouKnow
@p8riot @Conservamator @ScottWalker @johnestrada Note; that the republicans in Lincoln’s day would be classified as liberal and democratic policies by today’s standards. It was around FDR’s time when the modern day Dems and Reps started to swap their views. You share the similarities with Lincoln by name only.
@Conservamator @ScottWalker @johnestrada Except that it’s the 6th largest economy in the world due to democratic policies... #BlueWave2018
@Conservamator @ScottWalker @johnestrada What I’m against is your oppression of YOUR views on ME!
@Conservamator @ScottWalker @johnestrada Who said I was against any of that?
@Conservamator @ScottWalker @johnestrada Either way, you’re in California, a wonderful place to live and raise a family, sharing the values of the District of Columbia. Your voice will be smashed.
@Conservamator @ScottWalker @johnestrada Then don’t force my children for your obsession to hold a gun. You know what they say about men with big cars and guns...
@Conservamator @ScottWalker @johnestrada If you’re talking about freedom, then stay out of my gay marriage, stay out of a woman’s body, let me have my right to healthcare, let my foreign family come into my country, don’t force your religion down my throat and let black lives live. THAT is what freedom looks like.
@councilofdc @BrianneKNadeau @mayorvincegray Oh never mind, I just reread this! Ha!
@councilofdc @BrianneKNadeau @mayorvincegray Any way to stream it?
@Conservamator @ScottWalker @johnestrada This is incoherent, but what I can gather: 1. Wisconsin was built by Democrats which were the first to unionize. 2. No one ias asking for a handout (stay on topic son) 3. This whole country was built on the back of immigrants and slaves. Read a history book.

@BeltwayGreg @kcivey @keshinil @BrianneKNadeau @KentBoeseDC @ElectLoriParker @SheikaReid @dc4d So, why run for @councilofdc if you’re unwilling to work with others, or figure out solutions to problems? This requires you to collaborate, not work in silos. If you are blasting @BrianneKNadeau for constituent services (many of us are), what makes you think you can do better?

@CM_Silverman @BrianneKNadeau @Partnershipdc @tweetelissa @MayorBowser Yet the @councilofdc passes laws to raise the barrier of entry into services for the homeless, and refuse to redefine affordable housing and rent control. The Health and Human services committee refuse to listen to homelessness experts, All lead by @BrianneKNadeau #Sycamore4dc
With Congress in chaos &amp; mixed messages from the White House, your reps in the @councilofdc are more important than ever. We need a constant, stable voice to fight for you and the most vulnerable here in DC. The world has changed a lot in 4 years #ward1dc #Sycamore4DC #vote

@drcupp82 That wasn’t me, was it?
I am so happy to see @edlazere , a homeless advocate here in DC, challenge @ChmnMendelson for the Chair of the @councilofdc. Many in our communities are being left behind, with ineffective policies. Mr. Lazere would be an amazing voice to the Council.
@maustermuhle Happens all the time to those with disabilities, and all I keep hearing is “they’re collateral damage”... that is, until it happens to them. (Not implying that this is the case here), but I think you get my point.
@DCPSChancellor and @DC_PSC, how has DCPS and Charter schools prepared for school shootings, and not face the same tragedy that has happened in KY today with two students dying?
How is it that two 15 year-old kids just died in a school shooting, and it’s BARELY in the news!?	Is this what America has come to accept!?

@bowserpay2play @AndrewGiambrone @MayorBowser Now let me be clear on one thing, I never claimed to know everything, and I want to continue to learn from everyone, but you don’t get to tell me my worthiness as a candidate. At least I have the guts to put my name and my face to my options, while you hide behind a facade.
@bowserpay2play @AndrewGiambrone @MayorBowser And for those in the Ward who will become homeless in the future, we will be able to cause a smaller disruption in their lives, by keeping them in their neighborhoods, keeping them in their schools, and keeping them in their community...
@bowserpay2play @AndrewGiambrone @MayorBowser So, you’re telling me that those who were in DC General don’t hail from Ward 1? They have been sent there because there was no other place in the District to go. I would hope, and assume that this new shelter in the Wards are sending people back to their home neighborhoods...
@RepLoudermilk Stop misinforming your constituents. The military is still running at full throttle. And you all could have had a clean funding bill to continue CHIP. Instead you use it as a bargaining piece. Don’t piss on my leg and tell me it’s raining congressman.
@bowserpay2play @AndrewGiambrone @MayorBowser I never posed a question to be answered. I struggle to follow your logic with your off topic comments.

@bowserpay2play @AndrewGiambrone @MayorBowser And for context, I live across the street from the 10/V location and I was stoked when this property was going to be used for good.
@bowserpay2play @AndrewGiambrone @MayorBowser The great thing is that your guess is as good as mine, as we both have access to the same information. I believe that is a benefit to the community, and I am happy that residents of Ward 1 can access these services, although not exclusively Ward 1 residents.
@bowserpay2play @AndrewGiambrone @MayorBowser Just simply ship them off, out of their homes and communities. I think it’s very nearsighted and a stereotype that you think that it ONLY happens in these communities, and just shipping them off is the best thing to do.
@bowserpay2play @AndrewGiambrone @MayorBowser I am finding you passion commendable, but your anger misplaced.

@RobertWhite_DC @councilofdc @wmata @MayorBowser @BrianneKNadeau @JackEvansWard2 @marycheh @CMBrandonTodd @tweetelissa @cmdgrosso @charlesallen And as a council member At-Large, I wouldn’t expect this kind of hostile response from you.

@MrTinDC @peterkrupa @ranpuba @DCBAC @DDOTDC It does, however give you the right to park in the Ward.
@peterkrupa @MrTinDC @ranpuba @DCBAC @DDOTDC That’s actually a great idea!
@peterkrupa @MrTinDC @ranpuba @DCBAC @DDOTDC I agree.
@peterkrupa @MrTinDC @ranpuba @DCBAC @DDOTDC I wish there were less cars on the road, and I want to work hard to alleviate that, but I’m also taking a balanced approach to ensure everyone’s interests are being met.
@peterkrupa @MrTinDC @ranpuba @DCBAC @DDOTDC And I don’t disagree. However, residents do struggle with parking in the Ward. I have yet to go to an ANC, or any zoning meeting where parking was not the hottest issue on the docket. And yes, when you pay for a zoned parking permit, that is your right to park.
@peterkrupa @MrTinDC @ranpuba @DCBAC @DDOTDC Yes. A right to park their legally purchased, legally registered and zoned cars. they have that right. Again, I am carless myself, and I bike, walk or take transit everywhere, and I would love to have less cars on the road, and but it’s an important reality to balance
@MrTinDC @ranpuba @peterkrupa @DCBAC @DDOTDC So, in the spirit of being open and willing to learn, how do we balance 1. Experienced bikers, 2. New bikers, 3. Public safety, 4. the needs of tax paying residents with cars- who have a right to park and the needs of struggling businesses due to lack existing available parking?

@ranpuba @MrTinDC @peterkrupa @DCBAC @DDOTDC No no, not what I am saying. I am saying that careless bike users leave their bikes in places that can be dangerous for others to use the side walk. If they were placed properly, then we would be able to all share the sidewalk safely.
@ranpuba @MrTinDC @peterkrupa @DCBAC @DDOTDC I have been to almost every ANC Meeting in Ward 1 since March of 2017, and parking is the 3rd rail of DC politics. It’s not that I’m afraid of it, it’s just an incredibly touchy issue for many people.
@MrTinDC @ranpuba @peterkrupa @DCBAC @DDOTDC And I don’t disagree. As I have stated numerous times, I like and support this idea, however, it’s the way we implement this is the issue. I want to be sure all state holders are safe and everyone is being thought of through this process.
@MrTinDC @ranpuba @peterkrupa @DCBAC @DDOTDC Under your logic, we should rid the city of escalators, elevators, cars and buses. They don’t promote health and well-being and also are bad for the environment. Yet, we still have them, and I bet you don’t think twice about using them.
@MrTinDC @ranpuba @peterkrupa @DCBAC @DDOTDC ... just because they are not as vocal, doesn’t give anyone the right to dismiss an important group of people. They are equally as important.
@MrTinDC @ranpuba @peterkrupa @DCBAC @DDOTDC I’m sorry, but I will disagree with half of your statement. While I believe that biking and the access to bikes is important, I think it’s imperative to remember those who are often silenced. Housing, transportation, recreation, education, and voting rights...
@Alyssa_Milano if you’re in DC, I would love to show you around our Washington that we know and love... the one not controlled by Republicans. Let me know! #resist #DCValues #DCPride #Statehoodnow
@ranpuba @peterkrupa @DCBAC @DDOTDC Unfortunately, it does, and often. You may not see it, but I have clients that have been hurt. You asked for an opinion poll, and that is what I am giving. I love this idea, but it needs to be fleshed out more.
@peterkrupa @ranpuba @DCBAC @DDOTDC For example, curb cuts... when they were first introduced, people where furious about it with cost and temporary inconvenience, but once cyclists, mothers with strollers, and the elderly realized its utility, people embraced it with open arms. That’s that kind of solution we need
@peterkrupa @ranpuba @DCBAC @DDOTDC Most certainly. I have spent a large part of my career in disability and accessibility. The thing that most people don’t understand is the concept of universal design, ensuring the safety of people with disabilities, but at the same time, something everyone can benefit from...
And Virginia’s House of Delegates staying in Republican hands... barely... and by chance.
@ranpuba @DCBAC @DDOTDC That being said, I have seen an improvement
@ranpuba @DCBAC @DDOTDC I’ve said it once, I’ll say it again, I’m just concerned about people who abuse the bikes and leave them in the way of walk ways that inhibits the safe passage of those with disabilities, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups who simply cannot just move a bike in their way.

@ranpuba @MrTinDC @maustermuhle Not at all. Again, this isn’t a zero-sum game here. These are all important for everyone’s safety. But I am trying to address the issue at hand, which is dockless bikes.
@ranpuba @MrTinDC @maustermuhle The latter
@MrTinDC @maustermuhle A post from a month or so ago from a friend of mine. I also have photos of multiple bikes blocking sidewalks https://t.co/3a3WLmqorU
@20002ist @kcivey @MrTinDC @maustermuhle I don’t think this is a zero-sum issue here. I think they are both highly important issues that need to be discussed. This conversation happens to be around dockless bikes, so that is the topic we are addressing. But I agree that driver habits are also a serious issue.
@MrTinDC @maustermuhle Also, I would like to point out that I am an avid biker, and I love this idea of getting more people on bikes, I just want to make sure that we are considering the safety of all people.
@20002ist @kcivey @MrTinDC @maustermuhle I agree and that is amazing, and thank you for doing that, but not everyone has that ability to just move the bike. one person’s step is another person’s mountain, especially as it pertains to disability, mobility and elderly issues.
@MrTinDC @maustermuhle I am basing my statement on my experiences with my clients. I have had two of my clients now (two blind individuals with other disabilities as well) fall over these bikes after they have been carelessly left. They weren’t seriously hurt, but it’s a very real danger for many.
@maustermuhle While I agree with these dockless bikes in theory, we do need to keep the safety of all District residents in mind. The blind, elderly, people with disabilities, mobility issues, children, parents with strollers, walkers, etc. can and have all suffered more than an inconvenience

@starmlw @DonnaMartinNeth @guypbenson @SebGorka And I am unclear as to how I am being a misogynist, as I am having a discussion with someone who cannot answer simple question. It doesn’t matter if you’re male or female, if you can’t back up your claim 🤷🏽‍♀️ I am fighting for the rights of women to access healthcare.
@starmlw @DonnaMartinNeth @guypbenson @SebGorka This isn’t off topic. You are claiming that the law forces her to do something, and I am asking what that something is. If you cannot answer that, then it’s not my fault, and perhaps you all should look into the meanings and impacts these laws actually have.
@starmlw @DonnaMartinNeth @guypbenson @SebGorka So what exactly is this it “forcing” her to do?  It seems if you cared so much about other people you would push for common sense gun legislation. Since I am “forced” to live in a society that is so trigger happy. We all have to live with laws we’re not happy with. Chill.
@mikhail1973 @KC7PDY @guypbenson How did they legislate? It was passed in both houses of Congress and they removed the parts they felt were unconstitutional. This is EXACTLY what they are suppose to do. They didn’t add anything, they subtracted. What part of this do you not understand?

@DustinCanter4DC @GDouglasJones If we had statehood then we wouldn’t need the plate.
@DustinCanter4DC @GDouglasJones And DC statehood impacts all residents in all Wards, therefore falling to the responsibility of the council members as well.
@DustinCanter4DC @GDouglasJones I believe it is the responsibility of all elected officials to promote the injustices experienced by the residents of DC. I’m not saying that it’s going to happen while the council is in session, but while the council is in recess, we should all be doing what’s best for our Ward.
@pambesteder @MooreSenate So sorry to hear that. I’ll pray for you.
@DustinCanter4DC @GDouglasJones I agree, the plan we have now is NOT working, our goal should stay the same, but our approach must change.
@DustinCanter4DC @GDouglasJones look at my platform, I address this issue with bringing the lack of representation on the road. The argument must go beyond the beltway, and bring it to the most rural parts of the country fully inform voters and representatives of the most fundamental American right, a vote.
