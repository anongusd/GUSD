Video of Romney's comments on Trump: https://t.co/7eHawNM6BN #utsen #utpol
"Now I'm not always with the president on what he might say or do, and if that happens, I'll call them like I see them, the way I have in the past.But we can certainly work together, and our agenda will be for the best interest of the people of Utah and the people of our country"
Romney on Trump: "His policies are very similar to those I campaigned for. I wanted to bring the corporate rate down to 25 and he got it down to 21. So on policies, we're pretty much in the same place. By the way, I'm probably more of a deficit hawk than a lot of Republicans."
Romney won 88.3% in Utah County (Provo) in 2012 general election -- his highest percentage in the nation among counties that cast at least 15,000 votes #utsen #utpol

Both Cramer and Sen. John Hoeven (R-ND), speaking next, note 51R-49D Senate. 	"So the control of the Senate is in the balance," Hoeven said. "Every vote matters."	(Hoeven defeated Heitkamp for governor 2000) #NDSen
