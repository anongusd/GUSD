@TashaRedPilled @HunterReyWhite The VATICAN president  trump asked him about 10 questions  or more and about 8 of them were mine given to trump in 2006 the other 2 or more were his questions  to the pope Francis one of president trumps questions  was about the nephelin  giants and why the cover up to the people
@TashaRedPilled @HunterReyWhite Vatican he asked the pope that question of mine what does the VATICAN know about  STARGATE  opening up on this earth and why are you covering it all up that is just one of my questions given to trump in 2006 to ask the pope  Francis about the star gate and why the cover ups by
@TashaRedPilled @HunterReyWhite And the VATICAN  is finished they know this because it is one big fat money machine and they would  not be able to raise  a penny after this video footage  is shown to the world they would be finished some as that the pope knows everything and president trump when he went to the

@TashaRedPilled @HunterReyWhite Was of this earth what's so ever it is impossible  to build a real Stargate I am not having any of it its just impossible  in such a short time of only  the past 100 years gone by that the Americans and the British  could build such a device and use it what i saw with my own eyes
@TashaRedPilled @HunterReyWhite Was intelligently  controlled it started to close up and this tunnel effect was sucked back in to the STARGATE and when that happened there was three doors that closed  up into a single  larity into a single  point and disappeared  like magic out of thin air there is no way that
@TashaRedPilled @HunterReyWhite Then it started  to close up the real Stargate this tunnel that was made up of what i can only discibed as dust clouds and stars is the best way to discibed it it was like looking back at a early star formation of an early galaxy is the best way to discibed  it all this stargate

@TashaRedPilled @HunterReyWhite I want the whole world to know the truth what happened  that day in 2006 that would change everything I believe  in and more it happened  in a very secured place in Cheshire called darebury laboratory just out  side the famous  concrete tower you can all see built in the  1960s https://t.co/AJZyoKhm1x
@TashaRedPilled @HunterReyWhite And will shock you all to the core and especially  if you are religious  like trump is and you have your faith that  you all believe  in from 4 to 5 years if age from school its very hard to cope
@TashaRedPilled @HunterReyWhite It's all been covered up and classified as top secret by the labour party government  and the very Tory government  I voted for for years they have silenced me from going on any news media from telling the truth what happened in 2006 will change all our lives for ever

@Golfinggary5222 They changed the name to the European union parlament bureaucrats the commissioners  then took over each country one by one called the German  Belgium Franco agreement  were those three  country's would take over Europe  with forced  sighed  agreements of treats that country's
@Golfinggary5222 Of mass imagration of asylums seekers and refugees imagrants this is not the Europe my mum and dad signed  up to 43 years ago they sighed up to a single common  market and to trade only with Europe  the 43 years later they changed the game the changed the name and the rules

@LBC @Nigel_Farage Mark  I would live you all to see it fly but a word of warning if you go to the airshow it kills it for me it's now become boreing am to used to seeing that new technology electromagnetic propulsion systems antigravity wave riders technology the best in the world you are looking
@LBC @Nigel_Farage Ground level would be more impressive  than space and the atmossphere how would people  react  in seeing it fly over their city's and cover the whole city of london mark or the whole Heathrow airport  all of it thats what just what would there reaction realy be for all of you
@LBC @Nigel_Farage The world for ever mark so for all those journalist  who have been waffling  to me and the world on climate change stop what you are doing and talk  About  this picture it speaks a billion words i have only seen it fly in our atmosphere and space  but to see it take off at ground
@LBC @Nigel_Farage And in that picture there fhat is so powerfull that if every one was to start talking about it then may be the goverments  will be forced to let us use this new technology  that real does nargel faragde  change our lives for ever and our climate for ever with clean air all around
@LBC @Nigel_Farage https://t.co/766cPcLn9R
@LBC @Nigel_Farage https://t.co/pQZTpUDZte
@LBC @Nigel_Farage But at the end of the Fay the only person thst can change our lives for ever is to get every one talking about my picture and force goverments around the world to tell the truth about the advanced spacecraft technology that we have to day and use this new technology  to clean our https://t.co/7V49y7tsMw

@LBC head aikes  even drink in lots of water made no difference  I was to hot as my body was perminatley  over heating dissyness and felt sick all the time and very very week with no strength  in me what's so ever i fhought I was dieing thsts how bad it was out breath as well
@LBC nargel climate change does bother me i could not breath propley when we had that heat wave for three months it felt like a elefant on my  chest pining me down every breath was painfully slow I had nausier noise blocked my head was light headed for months I head perminatley
@SandraKayWard5 it slopes down from the front to the back of space craft telling me the air in our atmossphere pushes out down to the back end some how mark
@SandraKayWard5 millions of portals windows  all over   the space craft more lights than  famous  black pool eliminations if you look carefully it is hollow in the middle as if you could fly smaller space craft and land on the giant space craft
@SandraKayWard5 there's your answer to climate change mr president trump  look at that beutifull picture of that  giant space craft called alternative space craft that can fly in our atmosphere and space no wings 10s of millions of Tonnes up in the air flying a whole city flying
https://t.co/12sRRhFnqu
@SandraKayWard5 finger licking  chicken little when your msnm stop  talking bullshit I might one day believe  them but climate change is just another tax on the working class and the poor  for all goverments  to bleed you dry of your last penny or cent you have mark
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump God speed but mr president trump  why dont you be different from the rest of all the other presidents and fly in style  with my giant space craft that can fly in our atmosphere and space her this is for you https://t.co/j9X8DK2nUK
@ch_coulon the 7777 aircraft and he was asking me if it would fly when it is built and I said yes off course it will  fly I said in the future if the sproose goose of Howard  Hughes if that  can fly any thing can that big masive as a plain mark and it does it actually  flys to
@ch_coulon to show the giant space craft called alternative space craft that can fly in our atmosphere and space it can do both this is for the engineer that was told at Boeing company in america in 2005 and 2006 when he was telling me about this new plane they were going build
@ch_coulon this is about 6 km is 3.9 miles and this space craft that has been built is about 8 miles long and 4 miles wide  7 sided space craft  no wheels of couse 10s of millions of Tonnes up in the air flying a whole city  flying mark that 3.9 miles is 6 km I think so it goes
@ch_coulon never ever and till our goverments  tell the truth about this new technology  called electomagnectic propulsion systems antigravity wave riders that repel gravity  at a fornominal speeds  and the are of levitation  has been achieved  in the most amazing way ever this https://t.co/mEBPDGTYYl
@ch_coulon I my country all over the news networks the journalist are all waffling  on about climate change but China  and Russia  India pakystan want the west to pay for their mistakes of burning fousile fuels they want Europe  and America  to pay carbon footprint tax then
@LBC this is all lies and proper  gander bullshit for Teresa may priminister https://t.co/CW7YWuAnqC
@LBC https://t.co/7mogcTYRld
@LBC going to stop it then you lot of smart arss bastards that are preaching  to me and the rest of the world then even  with 3 trillion dollers of carbon footprint tax  then tell me I am very interested  you bunch of comeplete idiots stop preaching your climate change bullshit
@LBC these 2 pare of clowns are talking crapp and show me your proof then because you have none what's so ever climate change you can not stop when it starts simple as that  when it does start for instance you won't  be able to stop it thats what like a mini ice age how are you
@LBC nargel faragde  its time Teresa may priminister  cut out the bull shit about climate change  and stop these journalists  giving  me the most undeliverable bullshit story on climate change ever  i am not buying any of this propergander  bullshit ever full stop mark https://t.co/UpTXWXnRpB

@SandraKayWard5 you all bullshiting  bastards and don't ever preach to me and the  people of great Britain  and amerca again  on climate change when we have built alternative  space craft that fly in  our atmosphere and space  you journalist  bullshiting bastards  of the BBC and
@SandraKayWard5 fucking  corupted  bastards that are all on the news around the world today fuck right of with your climate change bullshit if you realy mean ehat you lot want to achieve clean air polution free around the world then tske the time  and fucking luck at my picture
@SandraKayWard5 once america was able to master the art of levitation of spacecraft  then space and behond is no longer limited they have  the lieing bastards achieved it all and more mark my picture speaks a million words around the world and I am telling all these fucking corru
@SandraKayWard5 that's clean air for ever when that acheived by the way we need to be using this new technology now  thats what we have laid trillions of dollers for this new technology called electomagnectic propulsion systems antigravity technology
@SandraKayWard5 climate change  you will see dramatically  change in our atmosphere strait  away you will have clean air all around the world in only 10 to 15 years after scrapping all plains mark
@SandraKayWard5 in only 10vor 20 years from now i have forced the goverments to change to all electric cars by 2030 and they are going to do it but that does not go far enough I want all passenger planes  scrapped in only 10 or 15 years from now then  all that bullshit about clim
@SandraKayWard5 again  what's so ever  the implications  are massive because there wont be any roads any more they won't  be any cars any more they won't be any planes  any more there wont be any more fighter jets anymore they won't be any more aircrafts carrier's  anymore in onl
@SandraKayWard5 and they will take him out if he was to tell the TRUTH  ehat I have 23rd you all that's why he and mike pence  have done it that way  by breaking you all in slowly very slowly with this new technology  that will change our lives for ever it will never be same aga
@SandraKayWard5 he and mike pence have gone down that road of introducing  you all to a new space program  they have all ready got for the past 50 years or more mark its very very difficult for you truely  wonderfull  president trump  but this is very  dangerous  times and
@SandraKayWard5 with Mike pence  that they are going to start a new military space program and have space cadets flying new space craft but you all ready have all that if president trump  was to tell america what i am telling all Americans they will assassinate him  thats why
@SandraKayWard5 these space craft that have been built trump as he was called at the time when i met him will get to see them all and will know about them for real how's that he president now that puts him I avery aukwaard  position and what he has done is tell you all with mike
@SandraKayWard5 12coclock above the plaines coming into land at manchester airport  by the way that space craft was a bout 40 to 50 miles up in our atmosphere thats giveing you all a true size of what i actually saw in size and distance
@SandraKayWard5 the space craft is to near the airplane  coming  in to land in only 4 to 6 seconds to land and if you look carefully  you will see a jumbo takeing of in the back ground scenery comeing up from the tree line thats 1 cm or 12mileters in length the space craft  was a
@SandraKayWard5 its been many years late but he does get to see the real deal tell him from mark mr real brexit all the presidents men  hope  you all like them pictures but the one how i actually  saw it is slightly wrong
@SandraKayWard5 its still not quite right if if was it would be for better than that what you all are seeing in them pictures i sent you all please keep them and share them with every american PATRIOTS people  right across america infact the world mark ps show president trump
@SandraKayWard5 impression  is what i saw in 1995 the machester near air miss at MACHESTER airport involved a British airways jet from Milan to Manchester airport involed me and 2 British air ways pilots  it was all covered up that picture took many years to all most complete
@SandraKayWard5 to you all and had no intentions  of telling the truth  what so ever just how advanced your space programs  was for 50 long years you have had a military space program so advanced that you would never believe  me  what so ever and that computer graphic artist
@SandraKayWard5 in that interview  with Bob glass tv NETWORK  documentary  mark NASA  the very people i followed  all my childhood life and watched all those Apollo astronauts  and mission was one big lie they were  lieing to all the American people  for 50 years they were lieing
@SandraKayWard5 what i am talking about Edgar  Mitchell talked on glass  tv NETWORK  in 1996 he gave it all away to you Americans
@SandraKayWard5 that were  sacked many years ago were  telling the truth  that i do know  I do not do conspiracy theories i tell you all as I see it and how it happened in graphic detail from start to finish mark true  story your space Apollo  astronauts hold all your answers to
@SandraKayWard5 up in space in 2008 from ground level on a start lit night in November 2008 thats about 150miles up out of our atmossphere to possibly  250 miles away from me in space thats giving you all the shear size of what i am talking about mark those to 2 Japanese pilots
@SandraKayWard5 ready got you space force fleet  of spacecraft you have 60.000 space cadets that fly all of these space craft I have seen 4 of them the mother  ships 2 giant flying saucers and the space craft in that picture you can clearly see together all three of them
@SandraKayWard5 this is atrue  story that happened  mark show america  what america has achieved but stolen you tax dollers to build it and private sector money the banksters and big corperatations that have been involved  for over 50 years trump was told in 2006 you have all
@SandraKayWard5 men that space craft you can see is 8 miles long and 4 miles wide about 20 to 30 times bigger that uss intrepid the aircraft carriers  that i walked up and down its deck in 1998 in new york 42 street East
@SandraKayWard5 true story and yes donald trump beleived  me in 2006 when I told him he new more then he was saying that I do know he mixed with presidents all his life and his father to he told me so in 2006 at the lowry hotel in machester uk england mark all the real presidents
@SandraKayWard5 propulsion systems  any more they have been back to the moon many over times with that space craft you can see in that picture that only takes 2 to 3 minutes to get  there thats all you are looking at the greatest  technology ever built in america and great Britai
@SandraKayWard5 bullshit I have ever heard in my life when the astronauts  told us from the Apollo  missions that we have this new wonderfull technology that is safe for our astronauts its virtually  polution free  noise  polution free and dosnt involved  rocket and jet propulsio
@SandraKayWard5 america to Australia  in 20 t0 30 seconds  that all when arrives it just levitates in mid air like magic  no wheels needed you carnt land it like a airowplains  you do not need run ways  anymore  or airports anymore so do tell me the BBC with your propergander
@SandraKayWard5 I am so fucking angry that our goverments  can tell me that I should pay fucking climate change tax for these bastards to fly around in giant space craft that is virtually  polution free silence no noise  what so ever can reach fornominal speeds  can fly from
@SandraKayWard5 america has achieved you should all be so proud but all so fucking angry  they have no chance of stareing this new technology  called electomagnectic propulsion systems antigravity wave riders that repel gravity
@SandraKayWard5 you future president trump  was told in 2006 i didn't have acopy  on me at the time but i told ghis true story about giant space craft that  have been built in america and great Britain  costing 100s of trillions of dollers on grey and black projects that is what
@SandraKayWard5 next time you fly out of any airport in any where in America that space craft you can clearly see in that picture will cover the whole fucking airport thats all the buildings all the runways and the whole perimeter of the fencing around fhat airport  you fly from
@SandraKayWard5 america and great Britain  is part of the space alliance  the american government  and the British  government  have had for 50 years or more mark
@SandraKayWard5 this is what i witnessed in 1995 and was covered up by all goverments world wide its a alternative  space craft that can fly in our atmosphere and space  no wings 10s of millions of Tonnes  flying in our atmosphere and space this space craft that has been built by
@SandraKayWard5 anwser on climate change I have been saying it for nearly 18 years we need to ban all stupid fly aluminium flying tin cans called passenger  planes that belch out 350 billion Tonnes of carbon around the world and scrap every plane in the next 10 years and use this https://t.co/jCATFlNHF4
@SandraKayWard5 ever been from 50 years ago so it tells me that if you can very quickly  change the air polution  in one  week of grounding all planes in america and our air cleans up rapidly  to 50 years ago when our lives were hardly affected with polution  then theres your
@SandraKayWard5 over america  cleaned up and over the Atlantic ocean  towards great Britain uk England and over Ireland scotland so we had the cleanest  air in our atmossphere  ever going back 50 years ago when there was hardly any planes and cars the air was cleaner that it had
@SandraKayWard5 so the grounded all air craft in Europe going to america and they grounded every flight from america going to Europe  and so internal flights as well this is my proof that the goverments lied when the flight ban took place right across america the air polution
@SandraKayWard5 so here is my proof if the goverments were so serious about climate change then here is your anwsers when  911 happened  now just think very carefully  every single  american what i am saying  is the truth behind reasonable doubt so they grounded all aircraft r
@SandraKayWard5 all the BBC is now saying that climate change  has to be √† priority  but i say it's the biggest scandle and pack of lies going around the world and you can sod of to your climate change bullshit and carbon tax on the working class and the poor while the rich dont
@SebGorka @SandraKayWard5 @algore Here is albore who made 100s of millions of dollers with the climate change bullshit video that was turned out to be a pack of lies so my message to the  European union parlament  and goverments around the world where's you proof on climate change you have none what so ever https://t.co/BxZvMwXezp
