I voted NO on Andrew Wheeler to lead the EPA. Americans need a leader at the EPA who will act on climate change &amp; work to protect our land, air &amp; water. Unfortunately, I lack confidence that Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist turned Acting EPA Administrator, is up for the task.
President Trump must reaffirm our alliances in the region, and remain committed to strong sanctions so long as North Korea maintains its nuclear facilities and dismal human rights record, including the detaining, torturing, and killing of a U.S. citizen.
I always welcome diplomacy to lower tensions on the Korean Peninsula, but going in without a plan continues to give the notoriously untrustworthy North Korean dictator the international legitimacy he has always craved.

We need to address the soaring cost of prescription drugs in our country. Proud to cosponsor legislation to ensure prescription drugs are safe and more affordable. https://t.co/SBH077Nmrl
New Mexicans deserve better than this. President Trump must reopen the government immediately. #TrumpShutdown
These are the people President Trump and Senate Republicans are hurting by refusing to support the bipartisan bills to reopen the government that Republicans helped craft.
WATCH LIVE: I'm joining @SenateDems to highlight the severe impact Trump's shutdown is having on hardworking New Mexicans like Sam. Sam is one of the thousands of contractors in New Mexico who's furloughed without pay. https://t.co/0q5UE57a4k
Until President Trump ends his reckless shutdown, close to a million households in New Mexico are waiting to receive their tax refund. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/iOIF9w4D0T
New Mexicans are eager to move our state in a direction that finally invests in our children, our people, and our communities. Looking forward to the opportunities that are possible for our state with @GovMLG's administration and the new legislative session. #nnmleg #nmpol
The @NMVoices KIDS COUNT report makes clear we must take urgent action &amp; invest in a stronger future for our kids. It's time to change the status quo &amp; I'm optimistic @GovMLG &amp; the new @NMLegislature will finally make investing in our children a priority. https://t.co/lEj1rwWWhd

Mel is a federal employee in Albuquerque, New Mexico who is currently working without pay. He's worried about being able to pay his bills if the shutdown continues #ShutdownStories https://t.co/NXTcnVjH3u
Sam is a federal employee working at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). He has been furloughed during the shutdown and has been forced to search for unemployment and food stamps to stay afloat financially. #ShutdownStories https://t.co/93bsrWHkHI
Pres. Trump has dragged us into the longest shutdown in American history &amp; it’s NM families that have to pay the price. I will keep fighting alongside @SenatorTomUdall to reopen the government &amp; protect federal workers impacted by this reckless shutdown. https://t.co/ZO1XhekYmA
As a woman with disabilities, Danielle is scared that a prolonged shutdown may threaten her low-income housing subsidy and her food stamps. #ShutdownStories https://t.co/kq6zTAumF1
Robert works as a therapist for mental health &amp; substance abuse in Native communities. He wrote to me &amp; sent me a video about how the shutdown is impacting New Mexico’s tribes &amp; pueblos &amp; how lack of funding will leave these communities without critical services. #ShutdownStories https://t.co/JOpPRgteS7
I'm doing everything I can to alleviate financial stress and protect federal employees in New Mexico who've been impacted by President Trump's irresponsible and reckless shutdown. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/sCfuKs9UxB
The #TrumpShutdown is taking a toll on our local economy. Our communities deserve better than this. https://t.co/44v8FrWdn4
President Trump’s narrative about border communities like Columbus, New Mexico couldn’t be further from the truth. These communities don't want or need a wall – they need investments in health care, education, and their economy. https://t.co/4OuIJ3bjcm
I encourage you to share how the shutdown is impacting you or your family using @MartinHeinrich and #ShutdownStory.
I’ve heard from many New Mexicans affected by the #TrumpShutdown, including Wendy from Alamogordo, who depends on food stamps to feed her daughter and granddaughter. She said she's terrified for the coming months. https://t.co/dDVryXQXp6
There’s too much on the line for our federal workers and their families. We need to reopen the government immediately. Proud to join @SenateDems to demand a vote on the bipartisan House bills to end the #TrumpShutdown. https://t.co/N0DnV42Bzv
Proud to join @brianschatz in introducing this bill to help alleviate financial stress and protect federal workers in New Mexico impacted by Pres. Trump's reckless shutdown. https://t.co/yAHlmRyOGR
The U.S. should be leading the effort to reduce carbon emissions. Instead, the Trump administration is dragging us backwards. https://t.co/EoLY63hOPx
Congress came up with a bipartisan solution to reopen the government. President Trump refused to cooperate. New Mexicans shouldn’t have to pay for the president’s reckless decision to keep the government closed. https://t.co/UoCJT8Qyne
Manufactured crisis for political gain. https://t.co/PXAWa87skX
In case you need a reminder, President Trump’s views about our southern border are untethered from reality. https://t.co/TepZFnSwD3
But the solution to President Trump’s self-created crisis is not a wall. Americans want and deserve smart border security policies to help us create a safer border and build a more prosperous nation.
The only crisis on our southern border is the one manufactured by Pres. Trump. His admin’s inhumane immigration policies have ripped families apart &amp; put the lives of children &amp; refugees in danger with their intentional chaos, disregard for human life, and utter incompetence.
WATCH LIVE: I’m on the Senate Floor calling on President Trump to end the #TrumpShutdown immediately. https://t.co/0q5UE57a4k
I'm headed to the Senate Floor to call on President Trump to end his unnecessary and irresponsible shutdown and reopen the government immediately.
The #TrumpShutdown is disproportionately hurting our tribal communities, leaving them distressed to meet many basic needs. https://t.co/JafJZJNKyp
500,000 New Mexicans could be left struggling to afford their next meal because of the #TrumpShutdown. People's livelihoods are in jeopardy. President Trump needs to reopen the government immediately. https://t.co/iQSsIcgJju
This is another case of President Trump attempting to cover up the damage of a self-created crisis. He should reopen the government before things continue to deteriorate. https://t.co/s7p4Kl1gSy
Keeping national parks partially open, but not staffed is reckless and it’s putting public lands, wildlife, and human lives at risk. https://t.co/k8HXUdvebk
In 17 days, President Trump's shutdown has created a crisis for our national parks. https://t.co/byUmR5k0om
President Trump either doesn't understand the detrimental impact this is having on American families and our economy – or he simply doesn't care.	https://t.co/8u78fdZnFv
Happy Birthday, #NM! On this day in 1912, #NewMexico became the 47th state of the United States. Anyone who’s visited or calls New Mexico home knows the remarkable spirit of our state is rooted in our history and culture. What’s your favorite thing about the Land of Enchantment? https://t.co/2shSU3XPKC
Trump’s shutdown is literally costing lives – is he still “proud”? This is disgraceful. https://t.co/wndTdVHntQ
Congratulations to @RepDebHaaland and @RepTorresSmall on being sworn in yesterday – making history for New Mexico and our country. I’m proud of the delegation we have fighting for #NewMexico in Congress and look forward to working together. https://t.co/iTMHQTzjo4
This decision sends the wrong message – it undermines U.S. sanctions and allows Russia to use NASA’s headquarters as a public platform for an extremist Putin ally.  https://t.co/Li9EE6TCNd
The House passed bipartisan legislation that would give us time to resolve disagreements on border security AND reopen the government immediately. There is a responsible path forward, Pres. Trump must do the right thing and end this shutdown.
The #TrumpShutdown is hurting our workers and harming the economy. The reality is, we could have a discussion about border security but we don’t need to hold our workers and economy hostage for Trump’s border wall. https://t.co/oIWCDjnHg0

On day 12 of the #TrumpShutdown, our national parks are at risk of permanent damage, undoing years of hard work and dedication by @NatlParkService and volunteers. https://t.co/UV11csT3SV
The #TrumpShutdown is disproportionately hurting Native American tribes in New Mexico and across the nation. People's livelihoods are at stake. Pres. Trump – accept the deal to fund the government and put an end to the shutdown. https://t.co/L1w8cBjW6r
The story of 2019 will also be climate change. We must demand real solutions to address this crisis and #ActOnClimate now. https://t.co/ns6WqbwO4A
This is refreshing leadership and long overdue. https://t.co/jzPR88Yjru
We’re demanding an investigation into the tragic death of Felipe Alonzo-Gomez. We need answers from DHS &amp; CBP on how they will ensure the health &amp; safety of children at our borders, adequately train CBP agents, allocate resources, &amp; prevent such tragedies from happening again. https://t.co/wreSozuPf3
CPB and other agencies must ensure the safety and health of all migrants -- adults and children -- in their custody.
One thing is clear: before any more consideration is given to wasting billions of dollars on a border wall, we need to ensure CBP and agencies on the frontlines of this crisis have the resources they need to conduct medical evaluations and provide necessary care.
The Trump administration’s policies have created the worst immigration crisis on our southern border in modern times.
Heartbroken and sickened by this news. I am urgently demanding more details, but the Trump administration must be held accountable for this child’s death and all the lives they have put in danger with their intentional chaos and disregard for human life. https://t.co/kx3RtPAlLJ
Secretary Mattis has been a voice of stability in an otherwise chaotic administration. My statement on his resignation below. https://t.co/GmBc4UpKFL

The fight is not over. McConnell made a commitment to bring this to the floor in January and I will do everything I can to hold him accountable. https://t.co/sA3iikILic
The Senate missed an opportunity to pass an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill that would have permanently reauthorized #LWCF and delivered big wins for everyone who cares about our public lands.
This isn’t a reality TV show. A shutdown has real consequences. Thousands of federal employees in New Mexico and across the nation shouldn't be held hostage for President Trump's wasteful border wall.
By passing this legislation, we can redirect resources to crime prevention and drug treatment efforts. I’ll continue fighting to advance policies that ensure the integrity of our justice system and make our communities safer.
What we've been doing in federal prisons hasn't been working. The bipartisan #FirstStepAct, backed by civil liberties groups &amp; law enforcement agencies, is a great step forward in building safer communities &amp; improving our criminal justice system. https://t.co/S9JwauXQdW
And this obstruction yet again prevented the reauthorization of LWCF, a successful program that enjoys support from both sides of the aisle
Mike Lee sunk the Sportsmen’s Act tonight
We're demanding oversight hearings on the death of 7-year-old Jakelin Caal Maquin. This tragedy, and the circumstances that led to it, shows the urgent need for effective Congressional oversight over DHS and CBP leadership. https://t.co/iTG7p1RtXM
If the recent ACA ruling is upheld, 17 million Americans could lose their health insurance, pre-existing conditions wouldn't be covered &amp; rural hospitals could be at risk of closing. We MUST protect the #ACA

That the United States of America would allow such a gross human rights violation to go unanswered is appalling and an affront to what we stand for as the leaders of the free world.

I voted against confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh based not only on the substance of his views and the broken process being used to rush his nomination through the Senate on a partisan basis, but also because I have serious doubts about his credibility and truthfulness. #SCOTUS
We cannot—and we should not—rush to confirm a man to a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land under such a dark cloud of credible allegations. https://t.co/lviUGjeRNj
Judge Kavanaugh should not be confirmed. The integrity of the highest court in the land is at stake. #SCOTUS
Dozens of people sought to bring evidence forward and felt they were not heard. Key witnesses—including Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey Ford—were not even interviewed.
Despite the fact that the White House tried to limit the scope of the FBI’s work—so drastically that I wouldn’t even characterize it as an investigation—the report still manages to raise very serious questions about the truthfulness of the nominee.
I will keep fighting for the funding, resources, and policies we need to ensure every New Mexican who needs it can find treatment and lifesaving care so they can get on the road to recovery.
I voted earlier this week to pass legislation to help NM battle the opioid crisis, including changes to Medicare &amp; Medicaid that will help more receive treatment, grants to aid prevention, and changes that will help providers treat more patients and increase access to telehealth.
I’m proud to announce more than $15 million in new federal funding to combat the opioid crisis in New Mexico.
When a victim of sexual assault comes forward to make a harrowing allegation, it takes tremendous courage &amp; needs to be taken seriously. Pres. Trump’s jeering of Dr. Blasey Ford is despicable and sends a chilling message to women &amp; girls who have been victims of sexual violence.
Equipping ICE and CBP agents with body-worn cameras will increase accountability and help build the community’s trust in law enforcement.

Congress has an opportunity to not only reauthorize VAWA before it expires, but also build on its success. Read my statement here: https://t.co/zHtTBaHMqp
If #VAWA lapses, 24 years of progress in recognizing and addressing the chronic violence experienced by women in the United States will be lost. We cannot continue to allow the needs of victims of domestic and sexual abuse to be secondary to political whims.
All people, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, or ethnic background should have the same right to live free from domestic and sexual violence. But Republicans have chosen not to make reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act a priority.
Many survivors of sexual assault are reliving their trauma today. If you need support, know that you are not alone. You can call the National Sexual Assault Hotline 800-656-HOPE to reach a confidential, 24/7 helpline.
I've been watching today's hearing closely. I believe Dr. Blasey Ford.
Given the seriousness of these sexual assault allegations, I call on Senate Republicans to halt the proceedings until we’ve had time to fully investigate and seek the truth.  The integrity of the highest court in the land hangs in the balance.
Despite multiple allegations, President Trump has refused to order the FBI to reopen Judge Kavanaugh's background check investigation and continues to demean the victims on a seemingly daily basis.

The sexual assault allegation made against Judge Kavanaugh deserves a thorough, professional investigation by the FBI before proceeding with any vote on his nomination to the highest court in the land. None of that can happen in a matter of just a few days.
The FBI is the appropriate investigatory agency to look at this through the lens of facts, witnesses, and evidence. This is an extension of the background process, and it is common practice for them to reopen a background check after receiving new, relevant information.
When a victim of sexual assault comes forward to make a harrowing allegation like this, it takes tremendous courage and needs to be taken seriously. Dr. Blasey must be treated with respect, and the matter must be investigated thoroughly by the appropriate law enforcement agency.
Once again, the Trump administration is showing its true colors through a short-sighted policy decision that willfully ignores accepted science. We have a moral obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate our contributions to climate change. https://t.co/bkaaqlfq3C

The American people still have a lot of concerns and unanswered questions about Gina Haspel's record, including any potential role she might have played in helping run the CIA's torture program and advocating for the destruction of evidence.
No Senator can consider Gina Haspel’s nomination to be CIA Director in good conscience without first reviewing the Durham report – regarding the destruction of videotapes by the CIA. #UnlockDurhamReport https://t.co/3RBHT6oxNh

Tune into Health Para Todos on @KSWVradio this morning to hear how I’m working to fight the #OpioidEpidemic in NM. https://t.co/gsSym5Dgd6
Far too many New Mexico families continue to lose loved ones to the #opioid epidemic. I will keep holding the Trump Administration accountable for half measures that are hurting our ability to confront this crisis effectively.
Over the last three years, New Mexico had an average of 516 #opioid related deaths per year, or 1.4 deaths per day.  It has been 119 days since President Trump announced the emergency declaration. So that would mean over 160 deaths in our state.
Every day, 142 Americans die as a result of opioid misuse. That means approximately 17,000 Americans have died since President Trump made his public health emergency declaration without providing the resources to actually address this crisis.
I was proud to secure $6 billion of additional funding to address the #opioid crisis in the two-year bipartisan budget agreement, but there is still so much more we need to do.
It's been four months since President Trump declared the #opioid epidemic a public health emergency without providing the necessary funding or policies to help New Mexicans find the treatment and recovery resources they need.
Today, I joined Attorney General @HectorBalderas and northern New Mexico community leaders to discuss our desperate need for more resources on the ground to treat the #opioid epidemic. https://t.co/BkwCJ8MY9K

This is about using scientific information as our guiding light to combat the gun violence epidemic. Lifting this ban will finally allow scientists to research solutions and give lawmakers the tools to make fact-based decisions on how to prevent the next tragedy.
After every mass shooting, we are cautioned to wait for the facts before we act. Because of the Dickey Amendment, we don't have the facts. Repealing the Dickey Amendment should be a no-brainer.
I am calling for the repeal of the Dickey Amendment, which restricts the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from researching gun violence and its effects on public health.

We must be absolutely certain that partisan, personal opinions won’t get in the way of the finding the truth in the Russia investigation.
The #TortureReport proved these torture techniques were a totally ineffective means of gathering credible intelligence.
We can’t hide the truth from the American people. #TortureReport
Disappointed in the Chairman’s move to erase history. It undercuts bipartisan credibility of our committee at a critical time #TortureReport

Last year 1 in 50 jobs created in U.S. were in solar industry. Our country needs to stay on a clean energy path and stay in #ParisAgreement
