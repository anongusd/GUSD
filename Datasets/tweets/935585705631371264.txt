@Education4Libs It’s all about a lack of accountability, which has been plaguing the recent generation. We know what causes pregnancy. There are ways to safely have sex. If you still end up pregnant it’s your own fault. Don’t give me the rape/incest line cause that literally happens in 1%&lt; cases

@Everytown Explain how you're supposed to walk away when you're getting your head beaten against concrete and screaming for help?
@KamalaHarris A former AG is describing the act of self defense as tragic and unjust?  Further proof that all you're doing is attempting to politically pander towards a specific group of people.  Black people all across America should be insulted and disgusted!

@1776Stonewall It's the major cities, where poor people feel oppressed and want more govt handouts.  Decisions are made based off individual selfishness, rather than morals in what's best for the country.  Growing economy helps, but as long as Dems offer free money, there will always be divide

@DiamondandSilk The only people who believe racism is prevalent are the ones who make money from it and the people they lie to!

@PattyMurray The primary responsibility of the govt is to protect its citizens from internal and external threats.  Every crime against an American citizen is an assault to the foundation this country was built upon.  The message should be very clear; you protect us or we'll protect ourselves
If illegal immigrants were self sustaining and voted Republican, the Democrats would build a wall so high it would touch the sky!
@HempStaff The argument for legalization should begin and end with; it's not the responsibility of the government to determine what is appropriate for you to consume!
@BrianFrosh I can't believe this needs to be said aloud, but he was obviously pointing to the fact that he has other routes to obtain funding.  Declaring it an emergency was the fastest.  Do something to HELP address illegal immigration, instead of promoting your own bias and ambitions!

@TheLastCLEFan @secretbetteryou @CNNPolitics Like everything else they report, part of the story may be true but it’s embellished and twisted in an effort to reflect poorly on Trump. More likely, he pointed out that he attacks them because they attack him. But that doesn’t interest the left base so this is the story we get

@ChelseaClinton Why does this need to be said? The current narrative is that republicans are bashing her for drinking but every single tweet from those I’m following echo your sentiments. Can anyone provide proof she’s being bashed by conservatives???
@JennMJack @lynnv378 So identity politics. The most obvious way of pandering there is..
@DavidMastio @EWErickson How is Trump wrong? Propagandists are masquerading as journalists and presenting their biased agenda as factual news, in an effort to intentionally misguide citizens who rely on them for information. Enemy of the people is a nice way of putting it!
@dbongino No they won’t because no one will be held accountable. The GOP needs to grow a backbone and come down hard on those responsible!
@marklutchman Omg please yes!
@htheike77 @SaysHummingbird I understand not agreeing with conservative causes or liking Trump. But if you cant see the goal of the MSM is to undermine him and his entire administration, then you’re not dealing with reality. You’re giving them a pass cause they appeal to your values. Not being objective.
@MaryChenevert @SaysHummingbird Use your own common sense. Take in every piece of information from as many possible different sources and come to your own conclusion. Wait for evidence. The mainstream media is leading you down a path. Stop following!
@jimmarlin1 @SaysHummingbird 🙄 👆
I’m so old, I can remember when it was illegal to enter the country illegally.
@SaysHummingbird The mainstream media has decided that it's more important to defend their agenda than report the truth.  They have intentionally misled millions of their viewers who rely on them for news.  They are a disgrace to their profession and to the country!
@SerendipityDizl @grgbkr37 @JussieSmollett @realDonaldTrump I shake my head every time I see someone hatefully call someone else hateful. Clueless!
@KamalaHarris Like mandatory ID for all voters?
@samswey Says the person who believes all the lies the mainstream media tells. Like sheep being led..
So Smollett created a hoax to further the lie that Trump supporters hate gays and minorities. Since, 100 people have been shot in Chicago. The officers who could have made a difference in preventing/investigating, were distracted with this fake celebrity case. Wheres the outrage?

@FightWrongs @pollyollydoodle @waltshaub @RepDougCollins Not a great example, considering he never had an opportunity to meet with the heads of agencies. Schiff and Simpson did meet. Which seems more relevant since he was the owner of the company that Clinton paid to have Steele hired and create the dossier.
@charliekirk11 Didn’t @AOC just give a speech about people like this recently!? 🤔
@TheBeatWithAri @MSNBC @RepKarenBass It was probably challenging for him to think of a different way each time to say that he can’t talk about the Mueller investigation. He was only asked the same question a thousand times..
@FightWrongs @pollyollydoodle @waltshaub @RepDougCollins Right. Wacko conspiracy theorist. It’s not like the chair of the House Intelligence Committee secretly met with the individual who created the (fake) Trump dossier. 		Wait, did that happen? 🤔
@FightWrongs @pollyollydoodle @waltshaub @RepDougCollins Nothing has turned up with Trump and Russian collusion. Individuals made bad decisions and were indicted. The target is the President and, as Van Jones said, it’s a big nothing🍔
@FightWrongs @pollyollydoodle @waltshaub @RepDougCollins And you’re assuming the investigation is genuine. I don’t believe it is. I think the DOJ has been weaponized and is being used by Democrats in an effort to seize back the Presidency
@FightWrongs @pollyollydoodle @waltshaub @RepDougCollins It’s a waste of money and being used to divide and polarize the country. He’s the most investigated man in the entire world and nothing has shown up for 24 months. Over it!		And talk about buzz words; I’ve been hearing ‘Russia’ from Democratic leadership for the past 2 years!
@RepDavidEPrice These individuals are criminals and need to be dealt with, accordingly. Start representing the constituents who voted for you instead of citizens from other countries!
@FightWrongs @pollyollydoodle @waltshaub @RepDougCollins Him for political gain. It’s partisan harassment against a sitting President and it’s outrageous. They have spent multiple years and tens of millions of dollars while finding no collusion. Enough is enough!
@FightWrongs @pollyollydoodle @waltshaub @RepDougCollins You misunderstand. Trump should have been charged with a specific crime and the investigation should consist of that limited scope. Now that it’s proving to be false, the scope is expanding to include income and tax records and anything else they can find to twist people against
@FightWrongs @pollyollydoodle @waltshaub @RepDougCollins Fair enough. But this isn’t a genuine inquiry for a specific crime. It’s a fishing expedition in an effort to discredit and cast shade for political gain. Since they’ve finally come public with no collusion, they decided to expand it to business and personal. Abuse of power!
The new Democratic strategy seems to be trotting out AOC and her unrealistically extreme ideas so, in comparison, their progressive agenda doesn’t seem so bad
@charliekirk11 @shoutgracegrace Planned Parenthood is a disgrace. Every election, they donate millions of taxpayer money into endorsing democrats. They’re nothing more than baby-killing money-launderers for the Left!

@secupp Save apologies, please learn from your mistakes and be better next time. It’s not fair to ruin people’s lives cause media sources rush to be the first to report, without corroboration. As hard as it is to believe, there are still people who rely on CNN as a primary news source..
@ChrisVanHollen Conversation first! You’re complicit in the shutdown due to you and your party’s political aspirations. Trump will be there around 4yrs. Do your job and pass common sense legislation or Maryland will find someone who will!
https://t.co/Lhu94nWiOI
@Bud_Doggin @HouseDemocrats Following all. Always looking for new Democrats to follow. The only ones that I can find are complete trolls..
@KathyCullitonGZ @ChrisVanHollen You should consider reaching out to @ChrisVanHollen, @LeaderHoyer, and other democrats to stop putting their never-Trump agenda ahead of American policy
@ChrisVanHollen Does this proposal include funding for the wall? If not, I have a great suggestion on where you can put it..
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Majority of Americans elected Nancy Pelosi? 🤦‍♂️		‘Nancy Pelosi will also be the one to decide on your impeachment.		You might want to lay off the attacks a bit.’	👆	Thanks for reminding everyone that this has nothing to do with actual substance..		Dumbest tweet ever
@KimDotcom @McbroomRobbie https://t.co/d53XbRK0nX
@donailin @ChrisVanHollen Fake border crisis? Is that why every president since I’ve been alive has campaigned for stronger imm policies? 🤔 And I like brown ones just fine, I married one..		Probably a good rule for you not to engage, all you have shared is biased, misguided opinion
@AsheSchow He shouldn’t apologize for anything. This transition towards censoring comedy will eventually lead to all stand up acts consisting entirely of knock knock jokes..
@donailin @ChrisVanHollen Referring to being a Russian asset dismantling the govt day by day		Dems like Van Hollen complain and fake outrage, meanwhile they have no reason not to work with him, other than cause he’s Trump. The wall helps America. Anyone who argues against that is not dealing with facts
@ChrisVanHollen Build the wall!
@donailin @ChrisVanHollen Speaking of someone who believes everything they hear..
@AOC You’re an idiot if you believe that the GOP is against women dancing. That goes for AOC and every one of her sheep followers. Stop being so easily manipulated

@FungeonMaster1 @Haunted2022 @chadfelixg Only a few of those instances specifically point towards an obvious hate crime. The rest could have been anything ranging from robbery to domestic. But point well taken, it’s slightly more of an issue than I originally realized..
@GallagherBarker @chadfelixg You’re Jim. You’re a great friend. You’re an inspiration. A loving husband. A talented chef or teacher or engineer. Why do you limit your identity to being a gay man? If you viewed that part of you as the 20th thing that makes you special, you wouldn’t care that some don’t agree
@GallagherBarker @mikey_bk @chadfelixg That’s a prejudice. While it’s true that a lot of gay marriage opposers list religion as a primary reason, the fact remains that many simply don’t want their tax dollars to be given toward something they don’t agree with. Whether that’s a legitimate reason is up for debate..
@Haunted2022 @FungeonMaster1 @chadfelixg What attacks?! How many members of this community have been lynched over the past 5 years?
@ForestPlum1 @DemmyIII @chadfelixg Very true.  But most would still choose that over rudeness and hate
@GallagherBarker @chadfelixg You don’t need a piece of paper to make you become committed to someone
@sunnyright Mexico will pay for it, indirectly. Their drugs, guns, and citizens won’t be illegally pouring into the US anymore..
@GallagherBarker @chadfelixg Where is that 90% stat from? Just an arbitrary number? 		My point is that you can disagree with gay marriage without hating people who are gay. The truth is that most conservatives couldn’t care less who you or anyone else is sleeping with. They’ll still speak and shake your hand
@GallagherBarker @chadfelixg That’s the issue. The spectrum. Not everyone who isn’t for gay marriage is against people being gay. That’s a manipulation. You’re following argument will be ‘if you’re against gay marriage, you’re against gays’. And it’s incorrect..
@DemmyIII @chadfelixg They are in the sense that they’re both completely subjective. Why is your good more right than someone else’s?
@bakeshakenbake @KIR_bigg50 @chadfelixg @drmistercody Thanks for contributing absolutely nothing to the discussion, Captain Dickbump..

@EdKrassen The entire reason Trump feels justified in his tweets is because of the manufactured / bias mainstream media. They lie to everyone in order to make $ and push an agenda ($). The only way he can get his truths out are to tweet them directly. The problem isn’t trump, it’s the news!

@GeorgePapa19 Now you’re able to obtain special privileges based off those things. 		Sensible people understand there’s no difference between any of us. But as long as the perks are available (affirmative action), there will be those who seek to take advantage of it.
@GeorgePapa19 It was designed to reach those in society who blame everyone else for their misfortunes. They didn’t get a job or opportunity because of their race, gender, orientation, not because they weren’t qualified.		The country then tried to correct that but, as usual, went too far.

@PD3598 @gaypolitico @mychopper_1999 @realDonaldTrump @maggieNYT What is it, specifically, you think Trump is guilty of on his tax returns?

The MSM is going to twist and manipulate anything they
@PD3598 @gaypolitico @mychopper_1999 @realDonaldTrump @maggieNYT Sure, losing the House is something of a setback, but the avg President loses 37 seats in his first midterm		Obama lost 63, Clinton lost 53, Trump lost 26		Advancing in the Senate by 5 seats is historic
@PD3598 @gaypolitico @mychopper_1999 @realDonaldTrump @maggieNYT Here's a little relevant context;	-Clinton lost 52 seats in the House	-Bush lost 30 seats in the House 	-Obama lost 70 seats in the House (more than any president since Truman) AND lost 13 senate seats 		It was EXPECTED.  I can explain it to you but I can't understand it for you
@PD3598 @gaypolitico @mychopper_1999 @realDonaldTrump @maggieNYT All of Obama's endorsed candidates lost.  O'Rourke, Gillum, Abrams, all them were hailed the new leaders of the Democratic party.  All of them sitting on their couch this morning.. 😳🤫🤭
@PD3598 @mychopper_1999 @gaypolitico @realDonaldTrump @maggieNYT Hilary's actions caused the deaths of American citizens because she was too worried about the political backlash ruining her chance to become president.  Not comparable.  Keep drinking the koolaid.  The MSM has you gullible followers believing anything to make you hate Trump more

@PD3598 @mychopper_1999 @gaypolitico @realDonaldTrump @maggieNYT You can't compare Hilary to anything that's going on with Trump, they're not close.  The point is that the Dems should focus their energy on serving the people, not their agenda.  Trumps tax returns are just like Obamas birth certificate, a smoke screen.  Nothing there..
@PD3598 @mychopper_1999 @gaypolitico @realDonaldTrump @maggieNYT The race card?  That's weird that a liberal would try to play that...  🤔		People cared about the deficit so much back then because it was a shock.  It was new.  There was no plan in sight.  Now there's light at the end of the tunnel
@krassenstein This tweet signals either your blind complete bias or you’re a moron. Winning the House was inevitable but you got your ass kicked in the Senate, which matters most. The ‘future of the Democratic party’ all lost. Abrams, Gillum, O’Rourke. Endorsed by Obama and celebrities. Gone👋

@funder Even if it were true that Republicans don’t care if people die in a ditch or want to repeal Obamacare, how does that make them pathological liars!?
@torresr25 @KamalaHarris Interesting question.  In a truly tolerant and free society, if a person chooses to sit at home and hate someone for looking different, that's their right.  However, if they decide to act on it in any capacity, it should be punished severely.
@torresr25 @KamalaHarris or vise versa?  Everyone is so ridiculously sensitive now that every slight with a hint of racial undertone is completely blown out of proportion.  Society is forcing people too far away from logic
@torresr25 @KamalaHarris Racial disparity isn't racism.  Racial profiling isn't racism.  Racial bias isn't racism.  Racial stereotyping isn't racism.

@JPFinlayNBCS Osemele!
@Acosta Then start reporting correct, UNBIASED news!!!  Misleading and misinforming the public in an effort to spread propaganda is wrong.  You will be forever considered Fake News and an Enemy until those wrongs have been righted.
@torresr25 @KamalaHarris Look at children.  They notice they look different than some people but they don't care.  Racism is taught.  It's like separating people based off eye color or height or gender.  It's ridiculous..
@torresr25 @KamalaHarris The Left look at the stats and see 500k black people currently incarcerated.  The Right look at it and see 500k people who made mistakes and are being held accountable.  The color tone of their skin is irrelevant..
@torresr25 @KamalaHarris It acknowledges PEOPLE for their accomplishments.  Skin color should factor in zero.  Whichever black people were heroes should be celebrated tho, absolutely. But a great way to unify would be to stop identifying everyone by their race.  We're not separate, we're equal.
@funder It’s a reflection of a large amount of opinions from the American people. What the left doesn’t realize is that citizens came to this conclusion on their own years ago. Trump is just the loudest voice. He doesn’t brainwash his followers, he speaks up for them!
@torresr25 @KamalaHarris Is he wrong?  Black history IS American history!  The fact remains that the term 'racism' is used today in an effort to bully, manipulate, and profit.  Society, at large, isn't racist.  Neither is the criminal justice system.  Anyone whos saying different is selling you something
@WillFitzpatric9 @funder He's a nationalist, who happens to be white.  Something I hope he has in common with millions of people in the country.  Black nationalist, white nationalist, asian, etc.  America First!!!

@EdKrassen No, it’s because there are a ton of poor people in large cities that the govt gives money/ housing to in an effort to buy their vote
@KamalaHarris It exists because people like you say it does
@funder I can’t believe there are people stupid enough to believe the trash you write. How can anyone think this is logical!?
@TheVictor69 @funder If there weren’t Trump trolls, a lot of people would be out of a job..
@_WritingIsLife_ @MoralsRepw @funder The difference is the media. There was censorship and bias long before Trump. Democrats trust everything their news source tells them, Republicans see the propaganda
@MoralsRepw @_WritingIsLife_ @funder That was before Clinton and partial birth abortion. That’s enough to challenge any rational persons views
@funder He was a Democrat in the 90s so no one cared

The real shame is that we've been arguing about left/right and haven't said a word about issues that separate the two.  Ideas over groups
@DonteStallworth so move there and vote against it
@granthpaulsen We constantly hear about Allen and Payne on the D line.  When do we start talking about Ioannidis's contributions?
@trigger077 @RealSaavedra Oh. We’re taking things literally now.
@krassenstein Farrakhan
@trigger077 @RealSaavedra Anybody know where Farrakhan was at the time of the shooting?
@trigger077 @RealSaavedra Moot since she was never elected President. An unbiased person would consider that a call for protesting and pandering for votes. Not calling for her to be murdered..
@trigger077 @RealSaavedra When Trump gives a speech that says ‘sometimes I think about blowing up synagogues’, you’ll have a point. But I’m sure you’ll find a way to indirectly blame him for it..
@maralagosinkhol @krassenstein @DavidCovucci 1. All are far left leaning biased news articles	2. No mention of Rep. You hear we are racist, white supremacists and believe it cause youre gullible and susceptible to bs trash propaganda	3. None are politically motivated. Its like saying every murder in Chicago’s left terrorism
@trigger077 @RealSaavedra Good point. We should wait until something like that happens before getting upset..
@EdKrassen Smartest thing you’ve ever said 👏👏👏		It’s too bad that the majority of your left leaning followers don’t share your opinion on this..
@maralagosinkhol @krassenstein @DavidCovucci As far as I’m aware, there haven’t been any murders committed by right wing extremists. Some people would argue that violent racism and bullying those who are different is wrong. Those people are hypocritical democrats		Know what youre not good at? Knowing anything about anything
@trigger077 @RealSaavedra We should. We should also understand that fighting back against violence and intimidation is much much much much different than murdering people and blowing things up.
@maralagosinkhol @krassenstein @DavidCovucci What about people who can’t even eat at restaurants because of their political beliefs? Trump and the right condemned these actions. Idiots like Maxine Waters invites her follows to scream in people’s faces. But the right is the problem? GTFOutta here...
@maralagosinkhol @krassenstein @DavidCovucci Yea and can you believe that every school shooting is committed by a right wing nut job? Me either cause it’s really the left.

@maralagosinkhol @krassenstein @DavidCovucci You're too ugly to be that dumb..
@maralagosinkhol @krassenstein @DavidCovucci By that logic, all Democrats could be sued by all Republicans.  If you think about it for 5 seconds, the guy may be trying to make a point...
@MorabitoRae @EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Brian kinda tried, Ed ruined it.  Neither realize that by constantly demonizing, they lose credibility with everyone who doesn't think like them.  Their message gets balled up and thrown in the trash, where it belongs..

@GOPChairwoman Those 'protestors' are bought and paid for by the left.  They act like idiots on purpose in an attempt to bully conservatives into silence..
@mikebwonder Lost to Hillary in the Democratic Primary, thus exposing how corrupt the DNC is?
@nataliejohnsonn said every person ever...
@DaveLeeC3 @kareljaros @honoraryamerica @CNN Truth and lies depend on which news source you follow.  Don't pretend like you're the only one who knows..
@MichaelAlan__XD @Breadmobile @BLM5280 republicans arent blind to the shortcomings of YOUR President Trump.  but someone with his personality is necessary to get us away from the lies and corruption of the former regime.  the democratic party is becoming more a violent hate group everyday, whether you admit it or not
@MichaelAlan__XD @Breadmobile @BLM5280 thats the disconnect; you think that everyone who disagrees with you does so out of hate.  that's the bully narrative; 'agree with me or ill use trigger words and call you mean names'.  same happens with race.  nobody cares who you choose to have sex with.  get over yourself 🙄🤚
@kareljaros @honoraryamerica @CNN other countries take advantage of their low wage workers, then jack the price up on the US.  stop letting other countries get rich off of us!  building them here will create more jobs and feed into US economy.  its not a difficult concept to understand..
@DaveLeeC3 @kareljaros @honoraryamerica @CNN nice narrative.  everyone who disagrees is a bot.. https://t.co/ZBFVeOIZxK
@r_rigatony @kareljaros @honoraryamerica @CNN not everyone who disagrees with you is a russian bot.  dont let the mainstream media brainwash you into that..  🙄🤚

Does anyone have suggestions on Liberals that I can follow?  I continuously have to unfollow due to their disgusting + hateful rhetoric.  Looking for Democrats that argue their points respectfully (and have points).  Not ones who yell and scream and cuss at the Pres		Suggestions?
@irishrygirl @realDonaldTrump So you created a hateful tweet to complain about the President creating hate?  🤔
@kareljaros @honoraryamerica @CNN While more steel mills continue to open across the country.  We were only getting a small percentage of our steel overseas anyway.  VICTORY!
@larryelder @ThomasSowell 👏 Now do homophobes.
@Breadmobile @MichaelAlan__XD @BLM5280 who are you quoting!?		there were people who used to beat and publicly belittle people for their personal decisions.  those are actual homophobes.  disagreeing with something doesnt equal hate.  save your trigger words..  🙄🤚
@MichaelAlan__XD @Breadmobile @BLM5280 i have the ability to agree and disagree with whichever portion of life I choose, as do you.  same as someone would for alcoholics or drug addicts.  you can love the person and disagree with their lifestyle.  doesn't mean that you're a hateful homophobe.  its a ridiculous concept
@LawrenceBJones3 @KingJames He should.  Being good at basketball doesn't make you an expert in politics.  When you use your platform as an athlete to publicly criticize the POTUS, there's consequences.  He could have focused on the good he wanted to do, without mentioning Trump.  That was his choice..
@ananavarro If posting critical tweets of someone you don't care for makes you crazy, by that same logic, shouldn't you be locked up for your criticisms of @realDonaldTrump?  🤔		#LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
@Breadmobile @BLM5280 You can be against same sex marriage without hating gay people.  If that's not a point you're willing to concede, we're just not going to agree..
@TalbertSwan @KingJames It's ok for two people of different races to not like each other without the white guy being the racist
@timjacobwise Make sure to use all of the trigger words!
@CHSommers So she posts hateful rhetoric targeting white males and everyone who disagrees are 'fragile racist misogynists'? 🤔		Perfect example as to why I left the democratic party!
@CBSThisMorning Good on Trump.  No special considerations.  You break the law, you pay the penalty.  Illegally entering the country comes with a price.	😎👍
@hunterw @realDonaldTrump I like people too until they're a dick to me..
@BLM5280 Exactly!  How dare that bigoted owner practice and maintain his religious values!?  What a monster! 		🙄👎

@OriolesFanProbz So we traded Machado, Britton, Schoop, Gausman.  4 of our main pieces coming into this year.  We got exactly 1 prospect back who's ranked in the top 100...		Duquette sucks and so does Angelos
@OriolesFanProbz See?
@OriolesFanProbz Recent history.  Machado is a legit top 10 player in the league.  He's 26.  The top prospect we got back was the Dodgers 4th or 5th best guy, ranked 49th overall in baseball.  That sounds like good value?
@OriolesFanProbz It would be one thing if we were actually getting good value back... 👎
@RealKyleMorris Shameful and embarrassing.. https://t.co/Rct5GPWrDX
