RT @HelsinkiComm: Now hearing from Michael Johnson @RANDCorporation https://t.co/6xhdwiozIN
During June 2016 Warsaw summit NATO allies agreed to rotate 3 battalions to match U.S. commitment in Baltics region
rotate armored brigade and use pre-positioned equipment for second armor brigade in Europe 2/2
4th option (ERI) that has been adopted by administration and Congress 1/2
3) Move existing units and existing active component equipment -  startup cost $.7b and annual cost $.2b
2) New units and existing National Guard equipment – statrtup cost $4b and annual cost $2.7b
1) New units and new equipment – startup cost $13b and annual cost $2.7b
So what is needed for deterrence in Europe and how much would it cost?  RAND study examined 3 options to get 3 armored brigades

Thanks to @MicheleDDunne of @AtlanticCouncil and @stevenacook of @CFR_org for a great discussion on #Egypt aid!  Video online in couple days
Jeff Martini: Cut off assistance? Change the nature of the aid? There's a lot of choices in front of Hill policymakers on this issue.
.@MicheleDDunne: I would not support cutting off training. US seemed to have regretted a previous training cutoff in Pakistan after a coup
.@stevenacook: The Israelis have handled this responsibly-- since Egypt is the crown jewel diplomatic achievement of all time for them.
.@MicheleDDunne response contn'd: The Gulf aid to #Egypt is symbolic, and is symptom relief-- not a long term solution for their economy.
.@MicheleDDunne response: #Egypt govt will burn through the Gulf aid in no time. What their economy needs is stability, return of tourism.
Response from @stevenacook: it makes it difficult when we're offering a tenth of what they are.  It certainly doesn't help.
Audiene Question: What do the other GCC pledges of aid to #Egypt mean for US aid leverage?
.@stevenacook: ...I mean this was 4 airplanes and the Egyptians already have 220.
.@stevenacook: by suspending the F-16s, I think the Admin was trying to nudge the Egyptians in a certain direction and it's not working...
Question from audience: if we don't reset the #Egypt aid/relationship now, then when? @MicheleDDunne response : "Yes."  Points for brevity!
.@stevenacook: If you do conditionality for #egypt aid, then conditions should be broad first principles of democracy.
.@stevenacook: The idea of tranches of conditional aid (see Senate Foreign Ops bill marked up yesterday) puts the cart b4 the horse.
.@MicheleDDunne: ...then we maintain relationship w #egypt mil based on their delivery of democratic promises they've made.
.@MicheleDDunne: I think we need to suspend aid to #egypt b/c it's our law. But I don't want to cut off our relationship w Egypt, in fact...
.@MicheleDDunne : US policy towards #Egypt has been on autopilot. It badly needs a rethink and a renovation. http://t.co/6hGbkOqskH
.@stevenacook: Our leverage over #Egypt has been overblown &amp; half-baked. It's been in place for decades and US has never tested it.

Portillo on Leadership's relevance to his recent nature documentary in the Kalahari: Meerkats are dictatorial little bastards. #PA2012
Sinek, contn'd: It's about stable transitions of power, and having a system that reflects your nation's values
Lightning round on alternative forms of leadership to democracy: Sinek: It's not a question of better or worse, but different.  #PA2012
Hormats: A: Leaders need to do a better job to educate/inform the public about the need for any reforms. Not downplaying them. #PA2012
Q from aud: Are we waiting for a hero on horseback to save us? Or should work to raise public awareness of need for reforms first? #PA2012
Sinek: Money and media are related. After Iranian hostage crisis, networks monetized news b/c they realized they could make $ #PA2012
Ken Feinberg comment from audience: Do not underestimate the enormous power of money to affect the message. #PA2012
Portillo responding: ADM Nelson had child out of wedlock with a married woman, but with no popular press, went on to win Trafalgar #PA2012
ADM Loy: Talk is cheap but behavior counts.  What you DO counts as your makeup.
Sinek:  So the party system is irrelevant: if a leader were to come along with a base following them, then they would be a leader.  #PA2012
Sinek: People are choosing someone else's vision because they come with a base that they have earned over years.  #PA2012
Loy: e.g, USCG rescued 33k after Katrina b/c petty officers and LtJGs responded to the ethos that had been instilled in them #PA2012
ADM James Loy:  Restoring leadership is about going back to fundamentals. #PA2012
Hormats: We blew the last two: going to war on the cheap after 9/11. And not developing alt energy after oil crisis of 1973-74 #PA2012 2/2
Hormats:  We've had 4 leadership moments in the last 75 years: winning WWII, responding to Sputnik were the victories. #PA2012 1/2
Hormats: And leaders have to adjust to changing world and educate others about that need for adjustment. We're lacking that element. #PA2012
Robert Hormats:  Leaders give people hope and a sense of how to achieve it.  And they have authenticity. #PA2012
Simon Sinek: Leaders are those who, like Steve Jobs, give us something to believe in-- something above the corporation itself #PA2012
Kresa:  The leaders who've been successful in business say "are you kidding?" when asked if they would run the gauntlet for Pres. #PA2012

BROWN: I don't believe that Japan is going the way of Greece. If it was, the political balance in Asia would be more adverse to US #PA2012
BROWN on loose nukes: Need to develop ability to isotopically ID whose (NKorea? Pakistan? Iran?) bomb it was if one were to go off #PA2012
BROWN:  Unfortunately, the worst ideas never die.  #PA2012
BROWN:  Re: procurement, better system would be to say firmly what DoD will pay and make contractor figure out tradeoffs.  #PA2012
Brown:  Layers are even more costly in procurement area.  The system was better when judgment was involved.  #PA2012
Brown:  Each of these extra layers in the new ODNI carried additional layers which slows things down.  #PA2012
Kresa: Eliminate the Service Secretaries?  Eliminate extra layers?  Talk about your points on this in your book, Harold. #PA2012
BROWN on posture 2/2: And a few divs able to operate for few months.  And be limited in our expectations of being able to do more than that.
BROWN:  On future US mil posture, I'd recommend light hand on interventions.  Concentrate on naval and air forces.  1/2  #PA2012

BROWN: We also need no more than 2-3 division ground forces to commit for a few months at a time.
BROWN: US is an offshore balancer, so we need naval and air.  Need special ops forces. #PA2012
Brown: US has to to find leaders to inflict the necessary fiscal pain, accept that people won't like it, and be voted out of office. #PA2012
Brown: In the long run, US needs to do the opposite (of stimulus spend). But that transition will be easier to envision than execute #PA202
Brown:  Not enough stimulus was provided back in 2009.  If we'd done more infrastructure investment then, there'd be more jobs now.  #PA2012
Brown:  Both China and US should realize a conflict benefits neither, but there are also those with strong passions on both sides.  #PA2012
Brown: As China begins to project power farther off the coast, our forward bases will come increasingly under potential threat. #PA2012
Brown: China has 1 used aircraft carrier.  We have 10.  So they have capabilities designed at our vulnerabilities.  #PA2012
Brown: Can we avoid confrontation with China? Possibly, but it won't come easily. #PA2012
Brown: So when I visited China in 1980, Chinese were still worried that the Soviets might take mil action against them. #PA2012
Brown: In late 1960s/early 1970's, Russia officials suggested US join with them to de-nuclearize China.  #PA2012
Brown: The period of the late 1970's was not a happy economic time, but compared with present it was very good times indeed.  #PA2012

#PA2012 What keeps you up at night? Bair: We're still looking in the rearview mirror at 2008 and not looking forward at how to fix the next
Cox: What keeps you up at night? Feinberg: Lack of political consensus-- has a direct bearing on how marketplace functions.  #PA2012
Bair: You can't just regulate one sector of the industry and think risks won't pop up elsewhere. #PA2012 http://t.co/s0sAGcD
Feinberg: Banking shouldn't break down along Dem and GOP lines.  Oh for the days of Bob Dole and Ted Kennedy! (laughter) #PA2012

Bair on Dodd-Frank:  Back off and let them finish the rules.  Feinberg: Yes, there is political paralysis. #PA2012 http://t.co/s0sAGcD
Rob Cox, laughing: I just saw a bumper sticker that said "Sheila Bair for Secretary Treasury." #PA2012
Feinberg: Pay czar was an unfortunate term: my grandmother would be very confused by that.  http://t.co/s0sAGcD
Wilmers: It's too simplistic to say break up the banks. It's in the trading where the insidious stuff comes along.  http://t.co/s0sAGcD
Sheila Bair: People need to stand up and support the regulators.  Genl public needs to start focusing on finance reform http://t.co/s0sAGcD
Feinberg: More political leadership is needed to prevent the next "too big to fail" crisis.  http://t.co/s0sAGcD
Feinberg: If there isn't a political understanding of what there is to be accomplished, you aren't going to get anywhere. 1/2
