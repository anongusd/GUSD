Now, I will say that it may be inappropriate, but again, she went to HR &amp; got him fired. He also apologized, sincerely. She later saw him working on The R Kelly doc &amp; decided to tell the world about how he tried to holla at her &amp; asked her a few sexual questions. 🤦🏽‍♂️
We were watching a doc about R Kelly abusing under age black girls &amp; black women! Toure making sexual comments towards a grown ass white woman, after listening to her have sexual convos w other in the room, is totally different.
I watched Toure’s interview about R. Jelly &amp; the interview w the white woman who accused him of sexual harassment. If he was fired, apologized 4 saying inappropriate things to her, &amp; has been actively engaged in doing the work, what was the point of her telling the world?

They know our history. We don’t.
Many AA’s are descended from West Africa. Our matrilineal and in some cases, patrilineal dna traces directly back to west african countries. The museum had A/A artefacts, prior to the Atlantic slave trade &amp; colonization, on display.
Watching Black Panther. I just realized that the art museum scene was set in the halls of the West African exhibit. The 1st art piece that the “expert” described to Killmonger was from present day Ghana. The 2nd was from Benin. The 3rd was found in Benin, but from Wakanda.
Seeing @ImAngelaBassett in Black Panther still gets me excited

@W33zMarley Thank u
U have a culture &amp; a history that was surviving &amp; thriving long before the arrival of the 1st Europeans.
@W33zMarley Wow. I’ll have to do some research on that.
@W33zMarley Which part?
In addition to the nearly 50% of the total number of Africans in The U.S. coming from these two regions, a considerable # of slaves had their origins on the Gold Coast, which is now the West African nation of Ghana, as well as parts of the Windward Coast, now, The Ivory Coast.
The Gambia River, running from the Atlantic into Africa, was a key waterway for the slave trade; at its height, about 1 out of 6 West African slaves came from this area.
Nearly half came from two regions: Senegambia, the area comprising The Senegal &amp; Gambia Rivers, &amp; the land between them-today’s Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau Mali, as wel as west-central Africa, including Angola, Congo,The Democratic Republic of Congo, &amp; Gabon.
Slaves brought to the U.S. represented about 3.6 % of the total number of Africans transported to the New World, around 388,000-considerably less than the number transported to The Caribbean-including more than 1.2 million to Jamaica &amp; 4.8 million to Brazil.

To re-investigate the African cultural structure is to reawaken and strengthen the African conceptual consciousness. In respect to religion, concepts are philosophical and transcendental aspects of developmental sciences. They are the fundamental ethos &amp; world-views of a people.
Yoruba is a religion.
Yoruba is a divine journey to the inner self and to God-consciousness.
Yoruba is not a cult nor is it occult.

@holy_wvter Maybe u wouldn't describe ur emotions that way. That doesn't mean that what I said is untrue.
@holy_wvter My pt is that ppl tell 🔥 &amp; water signs they're being dramatic bc they have a tendency 2 be destructive &amp; delusional. I wasn't projecting. I gave textbook desriptions. No shade 2 ppl w Sun in those signs. We all have them in our houses &amp; deal w them in the planetary transits.

The officers leave immediately &amp; I'm left wondering, "What was the point in calling the police in the 1st place?🤔" They arrived so late, went 2 the wrong address &amp; approached/suspected me, then they left w/o doing anything.
The officers walk away from me, jump back into their car, pull up next to the correct house, exit &amp; walk up to a white man w/o flashing the lights in his face &amp; say "Everything ok? We got a call." A white woman standing next to him replies "Everything's fine. It's just the tv."
They look at me disbelievingly &amp; say "We were told that it was the house across the street from ___." 		I'm so floored that I have 2 pause 4 a sec.		"No. I told the dispatcher it's the house on the left of __. On the corner", I reply, indicating w/ my eyes which 1.
The officers walk away w/o apologizing 4 the misunderstanding, jump back into their car, pull next 2 the home, walk up 2 someone standing outside &amp; say "Is everything ok here? We got a call." I overhear a woman say "Yeah, It's just the tv. Everything's fine." The officers leave.
Update:2 officers pull up, park in front of my house, shine their lights in my face, exit their car, walk up 2 me &amp; say "We got a call about this address." 		"I'm the 1 who called u. I told the dispatcher that it was the house on the left of ___", I reply.
I just heard a man physically assaulting a woman in one of the homes across the street from mine, she was crying &amp; screaming so loud, I had to call the police.

I smile &amp; reply "I get that a lot. I'm from Saint Louis &amp; my family has a mixed background, Are you from Ethiopia?" "Yes", she says then she tells me about her sons who live in Atlanta &amp; her daughter who lives in Saint Louis with her.
My spirit was pulling me towards this older woman, I sat down next to her, instantly I felt the energy of her children, male &amp; female &amp; just as I was about to say something to her, she looked at me, smiled &amp; asked "Where are you from? Ethiopia?"

2017 showed u the shadow side of the people u thought u knew. Including you.
Most ppl are completely unaware of the fact that New Year's Eve is an ASTROLOGICAL celebration of when the 🌟 system "Sirius/Isis/Aset"-the brightest 🌟 in the sky-is the highest she will ever be, at MIDNIGHT, + can be seen from virtually all parts of the Earth.
Us celebrating New Year's Eve is the perfect example of how the masses are conditioned 2 celebrate things we know absolutely nothing about 4 generations w/o anyone stopping + questioning where it came from + why we celebrate it.
Interesting that 2017 ends with 2 waxing gibbous moons in Gemini on the 30th + 31st (New Years Eve), influencing us to ponder + process before we step into the new year.

@ShunsuiSozosuke No problem bro
@cosmick_witch @netflix Yassssss!
@ShunsuiSozosuke Typo. Capricorn is associated with Saturn/Contraction/Constriction. 	Aquarius is associated with Uranus/freedom/un-restriction.
@ShunsuiSozosuke It was really challenging dating Sun in Capricorn people + initially, I had some misconceptions about what the Saturn return is. Now I'm officially in my Saturn return + I feel like Saturn is working 4 my benefit by blocking me from people + things that no longer serve my truth.
@ShunsuiSozosuke Capricorn is all up + down my natal chart too. I'm starting to really love it's energies.
RT @DaddyShiva: Saturn in Capricorn, who dis?
@ShunsuiSozosuke When Venus or Mars is in Capricorn, their sexuality is deep + powerful. They usually attract experienced, sometimes older partners who are able to maintain a sense of privacy/discretion, especially concerning things that pertain to the bedroom + they like consistency.
@ShunsuiSozosuke Mars in Capricorn like to be "on top of things", + aren't afraid of hard work..Anger, drive, competition, sensuality, + sexuality are all expressed in a "cool", disciplined,+ level-headed way.
@ShunsuiSozosuke Venus in Capricorn are attracted to serious, goal oriented romantic partners but they can be extremely shy + conservative. Marriage, family, + security are important 2 them. Living up 2 others expectations can be a problem for some.
@ShunsuiSozosuke Venus in Capricorn try 2 win ur heart by displaying caution, self-control, + responsibility. They sometimes come off as "too cool", lacking warmth + spontaneity but they can be very romantic, long 4 a real life partner + are willing 2 commit.
@ShunsuiSozosuke Mercury in Aquarius are also very attracted to scientific and metaphysical matters. Especially things that have to do with forward progress + the advancement of man-kind.
@ShunsuiSozosuke Mercury in Aquarius have a very unconventional form of self-expression which usually involves breaking the rules, being different. + exposing biases in others way of thinking. They enjoy intellectual debates + usually win.
@ShunsuiSozosuke Yup. 😊 The fixed signs aren't as interested in manipulating their environment as the cardinal signs + they resist others attempts at trying to change them + their lives. They also tend to hang on to the past, which can be their greatest strength + their greatest weakness.
@ShunsuiSozosuke Moon in Capricorn are also very attracted to the world of the senses + put a lot of value over all things tangible / real.
@ShunsuiSozosuke Moon in Capricorn are known 4 keeping our emotions in control, despite how rocky they may be below the surface. Displaying our emotions + dealing with emotionally leaky people can feel very weird + uncomfortable 2 us.
@ShunsuiSozosuke Sun in Aquarius also have a habit of being really stubborn in their opinions + resistant to change. 		Aquarius is an air sign. Air signs are known for being fair-minded + full of ideas.
@ShunsuiSozosuke Sun in Aquarius are known 4 their intellect + dislike 4 "the beaten track", desiring "progress + advancement over the "old + outdated." Equality + fairness are very important 2 them. Prejudice, bias, + societal conditioning are all very big turn-off's. Ex: Bob Marley.
@ShunsuiSozosuke Capricorn is ruled by the planet Saturn as well as the XV/The Devil tarot card. 	Keywords: Tenacious, conservative, resourceful, disciplined, wise, ambitious, prudent, constant.
@ShunsuiSozosuke Aquarius is ruled by the planet Uranus as well as the XVII/ Star tarot card. Keywords: individualistic, assertive, independent, humanitarian, inventive, original, eccentric, opinionated, intellectual, idealistic, cool, friendly, detached
@ShunsuiSozosuke Capricorn stellium, your inner planets are made up of fixed-air (Aquarius) + cardinal-earth (Capricorn).
