@TuckerCarlson The only two things Gaia Online has to do with FB are fb video games ( but not everyone uses fb for that) and to post your avatar onto FB but it's mostly by itself and sponsors lots of products people use everyday
@TuckerCarlson I said before Gaia Online is republican and tea party and they promise they don't read your gaia email Gaia isn't the same as fb and it believes in free speech and doesn't convict you
@TuckerCarlson I don't work with FB I work with Gaia Online it's different
@TuckerCarlson That is absurd to say the video game companies (that work with the boy scouts) are out to get everyone and are working with Russia is ridiculous
@TuckerCarlson I just like Trump I am a simple business women and I have done a lot for Christian churches and jews in Israel
@TuckerCarlson I have never lied about anything online I've been truthful since I've met Glenn Beck
@TuckerCarlson Now CNN is saying a toy company that makes comic book toys for children because we voted for Trump are terrorist what BS and oh I'm half black and half Asian too so I must be how degrading towards women!

@glennbeck My friends I hired to work for major movie companies may be democrat but they have like me given to the tea party and the republican party so they know what principles and values are and liberty is and faith is and what love is to their own kids
@glennbeck Does that mean people from Fox have something against Italy and Asia and Texans because that's what my family mostly is a bunch of Texas farmers who came to CA to make a better living for their grandchildren and married Japanese and Philippine people
@glennbeck Tomi L. has called me a Socialist ever since she learned I existed I have been on Fox longer then she has and longer then you Glenn I was with reily since I was 5 years old and my Dad worked for Fox and Disney then and you can trust me my Dad Mom Cousins are not racist

@glennbeck I know I'm Israeli and I'm not a Nazi just because I found out a year ago I was a Muslim and because I have gay friends that makes me gay and my family is half black and so many other things why does it matter? Why can't MLK be remembered?
@glennbeck I said great things about you and Fox at church for Fox and Disney and Warner Bros giving me a job all these years and yet when I look at my twitter your "Tomi girl' calls me a gay black Muslim Nazi that won an Oscar last year shouldn't be allowed to work for fox

@greggutfeld I am allowed to make movies with Tim Allen in them you can't stop me

@greggutfeld I and my whole big family and cousin in Hollywood go out of our way to work with FX AND fox news because my family are the founders of the people who originally made comic books and because of Stan Lee we have a job ask me why we should help you anymore?
@greggutfeld Sorry I do not appreciate the disrespect
@greggutfeld Gaia Online works with FX movies and Fandango so in other words I pay your salary and you dislike me and call me Claire?
@greggutfeld I've given most of my wealth to charity and you think that's funny? Well most celebrities only care about themselves it's called being self-fish like Obama is and Clinton is I'd like see people like you donate to mercury one to help people in slavery bet you won't

@glennbeck https://t.co/QdmxdvnmKm
@glennbeck I took birth control when I was a virgin because I don't believe in abortion and my sister was raped so she adopted three kids and now she is a grandma
@glennbeck I always give you my info first because fox has always accused me of being with the left and I always prove them wrong and I am tired of looking bad just because I have 'different' friends but I have pro life friends too
@glennbeck I know you remember that I told you months ago I don't know Harvey w. just Derek Powers he's Gaia's founder and I funded his tea party and they voted for Trump (they call themselves the lobster party)
@glennbeck These republicans can bash me all they want but I know what I believe and I believed it since I was 10 and they can't stop my joy because I get to drive and I get to live in a better state where I can have freedom and I am buying a better car
@glennbeck Don't these news people know I'm from Seattle? Yes I am from Hollywood but I do it in seattle and so do the Disney cousins and I want to move to Idaho to get away from the socialist (we shot all these 10 movies in Everett, Wa  and Disneyland) mysisterin cais amaid boss
@FoxNews there is a big reason why I trust the blaze over fox because Glenn Beck doesn't ignore me he cares about what I post and I know he saw that I was a virgin recently and I don't know Harvey weirdo I gave mine to Ivan from Twitch everyone knows this stop trashing me
@TuckerCarlson I just told Glenn Beck all about my last time being a virgin with the twitch billionaire people so pay attention to what I say before accusing me of lies and often republicans attack me and I am Republican
@TuckerCarlson I said recently I was a playboy bunny when I was skinny and younger and a model and an actress and now a director but I was a Christian and I was a virgin and I just dated the guy that created Twitch and with him I lost my virginity not Harvey and I'm 31
@TuckerCarlson you lied again I said I and my Disney family never knew Harvey Weirdo we work with Stan Lee not him
@TuckerCarlson I had a huge connection with Oreily so it's been hard to move on
@TuckerCarlson I'm sorry for calling you a bigit I take it back
@TuckerCarlson I'm not a fool Glenn Beck has made me wise
@TuckerCarlson I use to work at Fuji tv Japanese news network
@TuckerCarlson Gaia online has tons of sponsors to keep the site running for adults and Glenn Beck has many of their sponsors gaia has given him and the republican party tons of donations and so has starbucks and Victoria secret
@TuckerCarlson Gaia online runs banana republic and they are conservative
@VisitGreaterPS great place

@glennbeck I found cartoon network and discovery are owned by warner bros which I work for by working for gaia online and other kids networks though Kaiser
@glennbeck I said way back I said I was an actress, an director and a talent scout but charmed girl said I was lying and that my raped a boy and now I've proven that she lied because Disney has been with me since I was 10 and so has Warner Bros
@glennbeck a bunch of my cousins from Disney are making 11 movies
@glennbeck one of my Disney friends just met Ellen DEgenerous
@glennbeck my uncle isn't from Hollywood he just has a chemical plant
@glennbeck even oprah just made a movie about the wizard of oz with demi l. about a white and black family having a smart daughter saving her white dad
@glennbeck all I am doing is sharing my family tree which has so many cousins and that makes Whoopie Goldberg racist towards me because my family is just mixed and it's 'normal' this is isn't MLK anymore whites and blacks get married all the time newsflash
@glennbeck we have given to the heritage
@glennbeck I haven't been to texas since I started in Hollywood when I was 10 and I love the river walk
@glennbeck in ben 10 he has a cousin sunny and there is a rainbow sunny girl on the show sunny about a girl who is an artist from nick
@glennbeck Sunny is my nickname because my parents were married under a double rainbow and I see ultra violet light and sun bleeds rainbows and my eyes glow so I have to wear shades
@glennbeck W. Goldberg said 'who does this Sunny think she is?!'
@glennbeck Whoopie Goldberg has already said I'm stupid but I don't care what she thinks I was never a fan of the view I only like people in Hollywood that sing country music
@glennbeck I have my grandma's gold jewelry
@glennbeck your one of the most normal friends I have
@glennbeck scary men and women who are violent and break things out of anger
@glennbeck a lot of them have mental issues and don't get the care they need
@glennbeck believe me I've met every weirdo you can think of even white and black

@seanhannity I VOTED FOR TRUMP I WANT A RED WAVE
@WorldOfStu Ivan and Andrew are monsters not Brett K
@WorldOfStu And I do work for a Japanese company and Disney and Warner Bros and I have never been to Washington DC
@WorldOfStu the reason I would never date Brett K is because he's old enough to be my father and Trump is old enough to be my father

@realDonaldTrump I have been with the Republicans and tea party since I was a kid

@realDonaldTrump I voted you with Jim Baker and we are praying for you (and we want a red wave)
@TuckerCarlson Ivan and Andrew hurt us and they should go to prison it has nothing to do with Brett
@TuckerCarlson I never wanted to hurt Brett and I voted for Trump and Trump likes Brett K so I love Brett and I stand with Brett because I said those women are lying and I wasn't born when this happened and he was a  'virgin'
@TuckerCarlson I never ever never ever said Brett K hurt me that's a huge lie and I wasn't born and I voted for Trump so people should not be bashing me for voting for Trump and being with the tea party
@TuckerCarlson my tweet wasn't removed for saying men were pigs , it was removed for saying Oreily should still be here
@TuckerCarlson I have been a virgin myself recently and I have never heard of Dr. Ford

@TuckerCarlson I am only 31 years old and this happened almost 40 years ago so I wasn't  born I am not guilty Ivan is guilty this has nothing to do with Brett and this is about Ivan and Andrew
@TuckerCarlson Remember this was 34 years ago I wasn't born but I have a right to say he is innocent because he was a vigin and those women are liars
@TuckerCarlson Brett K is innocent he was a virgin and I don't know him I wasn't born when this happened to him what happened to me has nothing to do with him Ivan is not Brett K Ivan assaulted me and he hurt other woman and Andrew

@glennbeck For some reason Cartoon Network is on Ivan's side says he deserves 'black rights' but he isn't Black
@glennbeck Ivan is not Black he is Chinese and English and he abused me he would starve me death because he thought I should lose weight and said I had to dress up all the time and had to pay for my own meals and said his family was embarrassed by me and was a communist

@glennbeck I don't even know Charmed girls you can't accuse me of it just because I watched the original tv show
@glennbeck I was a virgin recently which means I still have principles and merit now you remember me saying that next time you dare accuse me of raping a 17 year old boy whom just wanted attention making me look bad because I watched Charmed

@glennbeck The point I was making by my friends being attacked is the guy was attacking my co-workers of Gaia Online and he thinks he can get away with it and I won't let him you don't hit women never ever even if they own a tech company
@glennbeck My best friend lady got assaulted by a guy that was friend's with her girlfriend he punched my friend 10 times and now she limps so she filed for an attorney and he hit her friend too I told he deserves to go to jail

@TuckerCarlson Trump has nothing to do with my dating life it's a stupid accusation
@TuckerCarlson My website is Japan not China
@TuckerCarlson Trump is innocent just because I dated a guy that went to Russia on vacation does not mean he's a soviet lots of people go to Russia on vacation and I dumped the guy because he's a criminal

@PatUnleashed Gaia online does comic books so Derek already told me the news of those batman movies because we are part of that

@PatUnleashed If people want to know how I really feel why don't they interview me on their shows because I will always support Trump and I have worked with Gaiaonline/Fandango since 2003 and with the tea party since I was 14 the year before I sang for the Queen
@realDonaldTrump I will do what ever it takes with Jim Baker to have you not impreached because America need you and would be lost without you
@PatUnleashed This is not funny! I am not gay! Just because I have gay friends doesn't mean everyone has to make fun of me! Republicans can have gay friends too!
@glennbeck I'm sure you heard about the 4 gamers being shot as a fellow gamer that games for a living please pray for their grieving families and that nothing happens in Seattle for the @PA_Megacorp Penny Arcade and everyone stays safe and has fun
@glennbeck I've always loved helping people and I'm glad I've been able for 14 years to help you with Mercury One You've worked so hard for years to make a difference in people's life's you deserve the money I know you'll use it to save more people
@glennbeck I really wish I could see my sister Heather now that she has her life back together but my parents won't let me see her because they don't trust her in 2008 when she almost wrecked our Dog business when I was in the Navy but they won't give her a second chance
@PatUnleashed I don't want Trump impeached
@DocThompsonShow I may work in Hollywood but I will never ever be a feminist just because I live the CA family doesn't mean I have think like them
@TuckerCarlson It will be a very very cold day in Hell when I'm ever a feminist
@TuckerCarlson I have a right to be an conservative and Trump shouldn't be bashing his own people
@TuckerCarlson Glenn Beck knows me you don't and I have always been a conservative republican and my mom has been to cuba she knows what communism is and it is like socialism
@TuckerCarlson I have been with Oreily and the tea party since I was 14 and yes I live in Seattle but I want to move to Idaho someday and buy my own house because I am tired of the socialism here and you have no right to say I'm a socialist because you haven't been on fox long
@TuckerCarlson If you want to put me in prison that means you want to hurt the republican party that voted for him because fund Glenn Beck because I'm with Disney and he's my cousin and was with the evangelical movement and I give money to the 700 club and Jim Bakker
@TuckerCarlson I will always be honest in what I say and do because I am a Christian jew and I was taught not to have sex until your ready and you can ask my parents I was recently a virgin
@TuckerCarlson Gaia Online that I work for is conservative and these kids voted for Trump with me
@TuckerCarlson I have been in the hospital most of my life so there is no way I could of met him it's not possible I love Trump and so does Jim B. and I know the people that pray with the president
@TuckerCarlson I couldn't of met that guy because I was in the hospital I can show you my medical records
@TuckerCarlson Hollywood is trying to make me look bad because I'm a republican that's why they are doing this lie I've only been with 7 guys my whole life  but when I was in Hollywood as a playboy bunny and an actress I was in the Hospital too because people abused me
@TuckerCarlson I work for kids networks and I'm an aunt and babysitter I am honest this guy is making this up I took online courses
@TuckerCarlson I don't hate people and I was a virgin as of recently
@TuckerCarlson I took online courses
@TuckerCarlson I never met him
@TuckerCarlson I am only 31
@TuckerCarlson The left is setting me up I don't know who this 17 year old boy is
@TuckerCarlson They can't put me in prison for giving money to Glenn Beck
@glennbeck Today is my grandma's 94th birthday and I know she loves you and your show https://t.co/aJrbAy1ro7
@glennbeck Johnathan is the name of the Disney director wondered if you ever heard of him? He and Alex are doing all of Saenea's Disney movies with Derek Powers from Gaia Online and I
@glennbeck I am looking forward to spending the coming holidays with the Blaze but I love when you recite Edgar Allen Poe and I love your Christmas sweaters because I grew up wearing Christmas sweaters too
@glennbeck Gaiaonline celebrates Jack from nightmare before Christmas for Halloween for their website just like they celebrate every imaginary holiday and every holiday that is religious usually the Easter bunny attacks Jack every year
@glennbeck I'm proud of my niece for doing 7 Disney movies so far I really hope you like her as an actress
@WorldOfStu I work for kids networks for a living how dare you say I would hurt a 17 year old boy I'm an Aunt of 100 plus kids and use to be a babysitter and I would never ever think of doing such a thing
@WorldOfStu In the past for my crimes I never went to Prison I just had to pay $300 for hitting a car
@WorldOfStu I can't wait till next month I donate to Mercury one and Operation Blessing and I get my groceries and video games yay
@WorldOfStu we are not a slave to the government that's like what dictator would say 'like in cuba give me all your livestock'
@WorldOfStu you can all take vacations why can't we? It's our money we earned it 	when people give to the tea party it's their right because they do it out of kindness of our own heart
@WorldOfStu I don't understand what your talking about because it's my own money and yes I gave to wounded warriors and we still do when my parents go on trips it's because of the dog business money it's not your money we are allowed to go on vacation it's called having a job
@WorldOfStu your lucky you don't have to eat veggies my parents make me eat veggies
@WorldOfStu and Amc and Regal movies
@WorldOfStu I only work for Fox because of doing Fx movies with my niece and Gaia online and Steam
@WorldOfStu Fred has a glue plant and a chemical plant and a country club with a golf course
@WorldOfStu My uncle Fred has a ranch on Texas and he is so lucky I want to live there and he hunts all the deer he wants and wild boar and daughter went to Texas Aand M and was a cheerleader
@WorldOfStu when I was in school high school and younger they forced kids to help the  environment they force you to join the green party
@WorldOfStu I want to move this place is run by progressives we have a gay mayor and a Pakistan council
@WorldOfStu I have always been conservative that why I gave to mercury one duh
@WorldOfStu The reason I have always dated democrats is be cause I live in Seattle duh there are rarely democrats here I hate Seattle that's why I told Glenn and he just said on air I am moving to Idaho weren't you listening?
@WorldOfStu I am a conservative and I always have hated Bernie Sanders and CNN  because Gaia online and Disney work with Fandango and AMC and FX movies (I am not my ex Ivan I have my own opinion you know I love TRUMP and voted for Trump )
@WorldOfStu Michael Dymond works for Disney, Gaia online and Steam like I do	and he knows how to code and make apps and video games and make movies
@WorldOfStu Ivan works for Twitch and Disney and Amazon
@WorldOfStu Michael Dymond I have only been with a few months but I have been friends him 5 years and he loves Trump, Ivan has always hated Trump with a passion and loves Russia and loves NPR and Loves socialism and is addicted to porn
@WorldOfStu When Ivan told me he went to prison for several times harassing police that should of been a red flag for me to brake up with him and I shouldn't of been so nice
@WorldOfStu I'm so glad my new boyfriend is Michael Dymond , Ivan Grantham is a dirt bag and went to prison before
@KennedyNation Glenn Beck is not going to give you his money sorry
@KennedyNation Four I have never met Cohen or manafort and never been to the white house and it's my Hollywood money I never ran for office it's my money I can do what I want with it
@KennedyNation Three the money is Glenn Beck's money Trump can't have it
@KennedyNation I never ran for congress
@KennedyNation one I'm not married
@HarryAndMeghan I happy you got married I'm royal too I am a Princess of Scotland and I hope you have many happy years together
@FoxNews We have two big businesses but our small business is local and takes care of small dogs and we love staying at home all day watching the dogs sleep
@FoxNews The only reason I wore a swim suit was because I use to be on the varsity swim team and I beat the top school that had it's own pool
@realDonaldTrump I am so proud of you and I would love to meet you someday
@glennbeck Ivan made me pay for everthing I never got any money and he was a billionare and he was just fired from Twitch and now Disney owns it
@glennbeck and I only watched Anthony Bordain on tv I never met him
@glennbeck sorry I never received any money
@glennbeck It was recently on last Thanksgiving my uncle John told me to Google Leith Castle as proof for me to see my family on my grandma's side is royal I had no clue I was royal it's still shocking
@FoxNews Well when everyone says your a liar you freak out like I did and I am sorry
@FoxNews I give to the tea party not to Trump it's a different thing it's Glenn Beck's money
@FoxNews Just google Leith Castle that's proof I am connected to the crown
@PatUnleashed it use to be worse that bad neighbor had a daycare and she treated me and the other kids like we were her slaves and the kids would have nightmares about his daycare I'm glad I lived through it
@PatUnleashed We also have a very close neighborhood park everyone goes to and a hill to climb for exercise and lots of green plants and flowers to look at
@PatUnleashed Our neighborhood kids are very little and are always on their bikes or walking their dogs with no parents and this a neighborhood everyone young and old uses to walk it's very safe
@glennbeck I know he did it so he could take out a life ensurance policy on his wife just like my Dad knows his neighbor killed her husband
@glennbeck Cynthia's Dad killed his wife so he could become gay but why haven't they arrested him yet? Why haven't the police done anything for years? They just let him get away with it
@glennbeck I'm Irish and Spanish but then again I'm a lot of things
@glennbeck I'm sorry for freaking out but you really scared me when you said those false things about me and I can't believe you would ever believe or even consider that I would hurt anyone ever most of all a kid you should know me by now
@glennbeck I do not hurt kids I work with kids and I'm an aunt to 3000 plus and I would never hurt a fly I was drugged almost to death at time and my parents knew I was in Seattle
@glennbeck You can't arrest me you are not the police I have rights I am innocent who is this 17 year old? Everything about this a just to get attention and is fake and I have been in the hospital and at home and I have people that can show you my medical records
@glennbeck The smoke is clearing with rain and now there is fresh air
@glennbeck Kids were kidnapped in Olympia where I use to live I hope they get out alive
@glennbeck I see I have to sign up for membership first I'll work on that
@glennbeck I was about to call you but I don't know yet how your phone works even though we have never met I care about you and show very much and still believe in what your doing and yes over the years you have changed and I like this new side of you
@glennbeck How could I have had sex with a guy I've never met  and that's not my real picture and those aren't my cell numbers I have no idea who that guy is he just wants 15 mins of fame I never had sex till 31 and only 5 boyfriends but they were bad boyfriends
@DocThompsonShow I think it's stupid to think that you guys wouldn't trust me when you know I just watching tv and watching dogs and Glenn knew I was in the hospital because he said'this is a girl that couldn't tie her own shoes or feed herself' I'm an aunt I don't hurt kids
@DocThompsonShow I am not working with the president on complains I just have a dog business and a Japanese movie company and all my money went to mercury one since it started long ago I've only given my money to Glenn not Trump
@DocThompsonShow And Ivan was my first real sex I didn't use to know what sex was and I was a virgin as of recent because I'm old fashioned and I believed in waiting
@DocThompsonShow Also I took veterinary and that's in Seattle and in Seattle I took a nursing class and my ex happened to be there and that's where I've met Ivan and now Ivan and my ex are friends I have only had 5 boyfriends my whole life and been raped most of time
@DocThompsonShow I took online classes at Princeton till I got my doctr.
@DocThompsonShow Ivan is Russian not me and he tried to kill me so I dumped him and I do not know Trump nor have I ever been to the white house and I never have run for governor nor mayor
@DocThompsonShow Glenn even said he knew at the time I was at the Hospital because you guys can hear me though the tv, all I do is watch dogs and watch tv I haven't been in ca since 2010 but that was for my sister's wedding so I haven't had vacation in years, no days off
@DocThompsonShow I don't know anyone that's 17 only the people I babysit on my block and my nephews I am a Hollywood star but to  be honest I haven't been to Hollywood much because most of life I've been in the hospital my parents had to pay expensive medical bills
@TuckerCarlson He is listening to the left fake news and to say I don't care about kids to hear him say that it really hurt I don't know who Glenn Beck is anymore because before he says he remembers I was in the Hospital before now he's changed his mind because of some boy
@TuckerCarlson Glenn Beck accused me of raping a 17 year old boy but I was still a virgin at the time and I was in the hospital where I couldn't take care of myself at the time so there is no way we could of met I think this 17 guy just wants fame Glenn shouldn't believe him
@FoxNews Yes my parents took me to Italy when I was kid and Canada and I went with the youth choir and sang for the queen but it was because my Dad had a propane job and my mom sold plants we are not elected officials and yes I went to Disney land and Israel but it's propane job
@FoxNews We are not in politics so how could we have used Tea Party money? And the money went to Glenn he used it not me ask him what he did with it, all the money went to Glenn not on vacations
@FoxNews I never gave any money to Trump I've been giving to Mercury one since they were 9/12 tea party 2002
@glennbeck I swear on Christ I was a virgin and then Ivan took that away against my will how can you be on Ivan's side? I have the right to be in Me Too and I thought you cared about me but I guess you don't tell who this kid is because I was in the Hospital and for years
@glennbeck Why are you making up a wild story? You knew I was in the hospital for years 5 years on and off and I recall you put me in the Hospital but I forgave you for it and now you are saying I'm a Whore? You hate Republican women don't you?
@glennbeck You said and I quote years ago that you knew that I was in a comma and on drugs so I couldn't of had any relationships "she can't feed herself she can't bath herself she can't dress herself she can't feed herself" Don't make me sue you for making up this story
@glennbeck Yes I'm rich but it's genuine that I want to help Glenn because I see him as a close friend even though we have never met but I hope we do one day because he has really changed my life for the better and made me a better person
@glennbeck and Ivan raped me I didn't want the sex and he is old enough to be as old as Glenn my Dad's age I don't want to date my dad and he lied that he tried to commit suicide to get Hollywood's attention
@glennbeck and I never have had kids
@glennbeck I don't know any 17 year old boy
@glennbeck I am telling the truth I don't know Cohen or Harvey W. or Manafort and none of my family(and it's freaky huge we could be our own nation) has never heard of these people or ever been near them in their life
@glennbeck But all my billions of dollars went to charity and to Christian ones and now the IRS tells me I can't do that anymore? They have no right
@glennbeck You know who Westgate Chapel is you have had Nick on your show from there the guy with no arms and no feet and it's the birth place of Amy Grant and Natalie Grant and they and I run a ministry that changes Muslim's minds and they become Christian merciful
@glennbeck You know that movie Amazing Spider-Man? Well they did it wrong because according to the comic book Gwen never died but she does become Spider Gwen female spider super hero so it's time she got a remake
@FoxNews Yes I am Chinese but I don't work with Chinese imports, I work with Japan toys and Japan movies and regular fantasy movies like comic books and others and Japan is allies with USA the network is in CA Fandango and Netflix, and FX and AMC
@glennbeck This is why my family is royal please see the movie when it comes out and support Gaia Online https://t.co/wjEr0f2e8e
@PatUnleashed Ivan said he committed suicide after he heard I left him but he did that just to scare me he is too old for be don't be on the rapist side
@PatUnleashed Ivan isn't dead he lied about his death to make me feel bad
@PatUnleashed I was spoiled when I was a kid because of my lonely grandma Theresa I had every toy ever made and all my friends got toys too because she was generous it was her husband's war money

@PatUnleashed I didn't know what sex was until now yes I posed nude like I said I was a virgin and I'm an Aunt I've taken care of kids all my life put I would never hurt a kid it's not in my nature
@PatUnleashed My Hollywood family never worked with Harvey W. and that's the truth I and my sister and cousins never heard of him or any of these guilty people
@PatUnleashed That David Hogg shouldn't even be famous it's a waste of his talent all he said was 'those evil guns should be taken away' like Obama said 'whoopdido, ' like we haven't heard that before and he calls me becky barns because I'm a stupid farm animal girl
@FoxNews we have been Republicans since the 1940's we are not going to changed our minds we would never impeach Trump we voted for him and so did tons of other Christians all I do is make businesses and write movies and I pay my taxes

@glennbeck Gaia online funds all super hero movies like wonder woman and batman and super man and marvel, big hero 6 and so many others that Stan Lee has done and other big hits movies by major stars most of my Hollywood money has gone to charity
@glennbeck I wouldn't be surprised if she was payed off by someone like Cohen when I didn't have sex I just did nude photos and nude anime drawings and we both walked on the red carpet in different fashion but I don't think it was Cohen just people like him
@glennbeck I was still a virgin til recently but Heather didn't understand what the world 'stop' was

@glennbeck I got the job  because Warner Bros knew my Wallace and Beck family already because I was a cousin that's why when I was 10 years old I was on radio Disney and in movies with my sister Heather I and Derek Powers my nephew hired me because I'm family
@glennbeck I have nothing against tesla
@glennbeck I tired to see my sister today but my Dad doesn't forgive her just like he doesn't forgive you for Goldline being a jerk to him over the phone or you not reading his book but my Dad doesn't forgive anyone

@TomiLahren So your cheering on how 10 years ago we went bankrupt? Did you know the reason we went bankrupt is a KKK burn down Hollywood businesses? So your cheering for the KKK? Bravo you actually have class, not
@TomiLahren So then you have always had a cushy news job and never known what's it's like to be through hard times or given homes all paid for to the homeless or helped food banks? You have never suffered you like me with being a foster kid you have always had it easy
@TomiLahren Yes my mom was homeless and doc freemans was bankrupt but that was mean of you to say people rise up from travesty haven't you heard the Glenn Beck Muse song? that was 10 years ago now we are billionares

@TommyBeer @BrianStack153 I didn't start out rich I worked for my money and my family was in all the American wars helping America we killed hitler's people and Japanese Nazis
@TommyBeer @BrianStack153 my Mom started as homeless so we made Gaia online and I was a foster kid because my parents couldn't take care of me but without gaia online we still today would be living the street so we started capitalism not socialism

@glennbeck I use to go to my house and they actually knew I was famous when I came in and recognized me where as three other churches said I was lying and wanted to put me in an intuition so I felt comfortable in the Mormon church instead of luthern or penacost
@glennbeck Shawna and Brian claimed I was mentally ill and I was making my Hollywood life up and other churches thought I was doing the same but the proof is on the internet when you google my fashion lines and products and the pics I sent to you and doc and Pat
@glennbeck Cody and Mike Warfield and David Benner and Gavin afford served two years in prison for what they did to me and my family but Brian and Shawna got away with theirs because a church protected them when they stole my identity
@glennbeck I am not Russian and Chinese but Ivan is and he's in prison now
@glennbeck Remember it was you that called me your Russian and Chinese bride when I told you I am S. Korea and Japanese and Romanian and Slovenia and press called me a communist because of what you said
@DocThompsonShow I use my gaia paycheck to donate to mercury one all the time
@DocThompsonShow CBS owns most of gaia and so does Disney
@DocThompsonShow gaia works with Fox Network and other kids networks and CNN to make series and movies and fashion and make up and food and jewelry and vitamins' etc
@DocThompsonShow gaia donates to the teaparty and it's sponsors are the same as gaia online and they pay me to be site monitor
@DocThompsonShow gaia protects the constitution forums and freedom of religion and freedom of NRA and doesn't believe in abortion and believes you should adopt kids but believes you can marry straight or gay and you can't promote dictators and hate jews
@glennbeck I'm seeing the story about my gaia online family one of novels we published besides lotr and harry potter and Narnia and mission impossible and borne identity and the lego movie and shrek and Thor and alice in wonderland and toy story and snitch https://t.co/xqv2N13836

@glennbeck Now I'm with the creator of Steam Mike Dymond and I've never been married and now I am engaged and he is 29 and I am 31 but that's closer in age then Grantham who rapes kids for a living and Mike saved me from Ivan
@glennbeck the real story is like I said before Ivan invented Twitch I invented Gaia online and we are 20 years apart but he cheated on me with another girl with a daughter and he raped the daughter and woman so I dumped my boyfriend
@FoxNews I am Japanese and my grandma fought against Japanese and she was Japanese our loyality is to America

@glennbeck Wehrenberg Theatres and Carmike Cinemas and Goodrich Quality Theatres, Harkins Theatres and Bartlett Cinemas, Brenden Theatres and  Edwards Theatres, Regal Cinemas and are owned by the Wallace's and Becks in my family I just figured that out
@glennbeck we are also doctors and lawyers and dentists and firefighters and airforce and Hollywood stars and royalty so we own a lot of companies but a lot of it is thanks to you because you stood up for us and we are grateful for that and as thanks I will help mercury

@glennbeck Gaia online and other sites are conservative libertinism you have to use trade and capitalism to win and right now we are not a socialist system and I don't think that will work I think it will make us go bankrupt
@glennbeck Gaia online and Steam was invented by the Japanese they are honorable people and want to best for America it's not a dictator driven video game to make slaves out of people it's for Capitalism and it bans anyone that talks about bulling Jews
@realDonaldTrump I don't care what they say you a great President and no one should ever call you Hitler because you deserve honor and respect and so does your beautiful wife and smart kids
@michelleisawolf Now Fox is accusing me of being you we are not the same person you don't know what honor is love and life and you think Trump my cousin is the devil and you think no one should be a mother anymore like I said before you need to grow up and give birth
@glennbeck I thought we were friends why do you keep naming me after my socialist cousins whom want you dead because you are white and want Trump impeached I am not Ms. Nisbet or am I Cynthia Tharp who love Hilary and Berney Sanders stop you and Fox need to stop

@FoxNews Gaia online had billions of users all over the world and they all like Trump you'd be surprised all the people that love Trump it's not just America and they want their countries to be like Trump's America and we are Japan not Russia none of my family friend employees
@FoxNews Tucker Carlson has stood up for me like Oreily did and believes I am a true Republican why does everyone doubt my loyality to Trump? I don't understand it
@FoxNews Trump is my cousin so I will always stand by him what ever he says he is making everything better and I have never ever doubted him even Gaia Online Japan loves him and that's my company Japan loves Trump Japan would do anything for Trump even Tucker Carlson knows
@FoxNews I will say this one last time and don't ask me again, I voted for Trump and so did the rest of my huge family and we were with Jim baker's people that predicted Trump would win 6 years ago and I have always been by Trump's side because he is my cousin

@glennbeck Founders. JAFRA was started by Jan and Frank Day in 1956 in Malibu, California. The Days studied the ancient beauty secrets of the Egyptians and created JAFRA's signature skin care product: Royal Jelly Milk Balm.

@glennbeck And the reason I have never had sex is because I don't believe in abortion and like you said I think it's a holocaust like they did to the jews, my parents went to Israel and loved it and my mom wears a jewish star necklace
@glennbeck The reason I have never had sex and am still a virgin is because I believe in waiting for the right person, even the guy I was just with we never had sex and it wasn't real love he just wanted me for my looks and money even though he had money
