Congress has not allocated funding for SNAP beyond January, the program’s emergency reserves would not cover even 2/3 of February’s payments, according to past disbursements. Last September, the most recent month for which data is available, SNAP disbursed $4.7 BM in benefits.

@ABCPolitics Countries do not “lose” money on trade deficits, so there is no money to earn; the size of a trade deficit or surplus can be determined by other factors besides trade. Congress must still appropriate the money, and the trade agreement has not been ratified.
No, Trump has not started building the wall. Congress only appropriated money for bollard, replacement or secondary fencing. Trump often refers to a wall that was started in California, but that is a bollard fence which was planned in 2009. This is a Bottomless Pinocchio claim.

And they’ve heard from some members struggling between buying food and paying for prescription medicine, and that some are contemplating rationing or sharing medications, like insulin.
@RushLimbaughEIB @TrumpNewsz @JoelOsteen @business @Franklin_Graham @SenateGOP @JerryFalwellJr  Unions like Unite Here and 32BJ SEIU said that they’ve heard from members who are concerned about rent and utilities.
The House of Representatives passed legislation to fully fund the government Thursday, but the Senate won’t consider the bill, and Trump has said he’ll refuse to sign the House package because it doesn’t include funding for the border wall.
Gov’t employees usually receive back pay once shutdowns have concluded, but workers who are paid by companies that have contracts with the government don’t receive pay for services that can’t be billed to the government while facilities are shut down.
When the gov’t does reopen, an estimated 1,500 workers — according to two unions that represent some of the janitors, security guards, cafeteria workers, and hospitality workers who staff federal facilities — likely won’t receive any back pay from the duration of the shutdown.
On Day 14 of the partial government shutdown, Donna Kelly, a 63-year-old federally subcontracted security officer for the Smithsonian, is wondering if her high blood pressure medication will last through the end of the month — let alone the entire shutdown.

On 10/23/10: two years into President Obama’s first term &amp; 2 weeks before the 1st midterm elections of his presidency.  Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made a now-infamous statement: “The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.”

of that investigation, including being held accountable for legal violations that carry the risk of serious jail time and removal from office. One can imagine no reason for Trump’s appointment of Whitaker other than the hope of such illegitimate protection. Huff Post
Over months of using cable television appearances to audition for the role, Whitaker has nurtured the president’s expectation that he can and will refuse to recuse himself from oversight of Mueller’s investigation, and will indeed shield Trump and his family from any consequence
Trump has been told repeatedly, by members of his own party, that sacking Sessions and otherwise threatening Mueller could cost him his presidency. Yet he has done just that. Huff Post
