@tyronefoto @APAH_org @BAJCDC "Let's call a spade a spade. It is gentrification." - @LaColectiVA703 organizer Danny Cendejas #KojoAmazon		https://t.co/X6pbE9FbkI
@tyronefoto @APAH_org "What they have heard is that the jobs that are coming in aren't jobs that will work for them.?" That's @BAJCDC's Cicely Whitfield on low-income residents' perspectives. #KojoAmazon		https://t.co/X6pbE9FbkI
@tyronefoto @APAH_org "We're 26 square miles in Arlington. We're not making more land." - @APAH_org VP Carmen Romero 		#KojoAmazon	https://t.co/X6pbE9FbkI
@tyronefoto "We've lost 85-95% of our market-rate affordable housing. That's housing affordable to someone making 65% of area median income," says @APAH_org VP Carmen Romero. #KojoAmazon		https://t.co/X6pbE9FbkI

Marie Serrano, a local building trades union representative, suggests that Amazon-related development should be subject to a project-labor agreement. #KojoAmazon		https://t.co/X6pbE9FbkI
@kcristol Alex Iams with Arlington Economic Development gives us the numbers: the county has lost 34,000 federally-related jobs in all of Arlington since 2001, including 17,000 in Base Realignment and Closure. #KojoAmazon 		https://t.co/X6pbE9FbkI
@kcristol A local business owner in the audience comments: "Small businesses are the ones who really create long-lasting jobs." #KojoAmazon 		https://t.co/X6pbE9FbkI https://t.co/IS66krhgCy
@kcristol Arlington transportation director Dennis Cristeal says the county has unused transit capacity: "I had to go back to 1986 to find ridership at the Crystal City metro station [comparable] to where we are today." #KojoAmazon		https://t.co/X6pbE9FbkI
"How do you get Amazon to do stuff?" Kojo asks @kcristol. She responds: "Arlington has not offered tax breaks to Amazon. What we're looking at is restoring our tax base," by filling open office space. "That's the community benefit." #KojoAmazon 		https://t.co/X6pbE9FbkI https://t.co/X1pI0xvNjb

@A_Silberberg @kcristol Alexandria mayor-elect @justindotnet responds to concerns about Amazon's transportation and housing impacts: "These are issues that we have been dealing with for a long time," before Amazon's arrival. #KojoAmazon 		https://t.co/X6pbE9FbkI https://t.co/2VifRjQHqk
@A_Silberberg "I'm looking for skeptics here," Kojo says to Arlington Board Chair @kcristol. "The County Board was not interested in being the biggest bidder for this...we weren't interested in huge tax breaks," she replies. #KojoAmazon		https://t.co/X6pbE9FbkI
"The whole announcement is a game-changer for the region." That's Alexandria mayor @A_Silberberg, kicking the town hall off. #KojoAmazon 		https://t.co/X6pbE9FbkI https://t.co/HRI8vw8V3X

@AdieTomer @JWPascale @JWPascale says, "We think of the Metro as the main system, so even if there are late night buses, you have to think of the transit system as Metrorail centric."
@AdieTomer @JWPascale A caller says, the Metro is so inconsistent, that's why people don't use it. It's ridiculous that we have such an inept Metro system.
@AdieTomer @JWPascale "Only about 11% of people actually live in the District, so we have to think about how to get riders from one low density area to another," says @AdieTomer
@AdieTomer @JWPascale "We really saw our Uber pilot program as an extra amenity, and not a core part of our service at this point," says Erik Johanson of @SEPTA
@AdieTomer @JWPascale How to handle the digital disconnect and public transit? "Public transit works in the analog and digital environment. So when this service launches, how can Metro make sure that they can serve people after hours that also don't have smartphones," says @AdieTomer
@AdieTomer @JWPascale "What will inform this debate is the push and pull between what's the best service that helps our economy move and how do we operate a system that might become more of a mobility agency rather than a transit agency," says @AdieTomer
@AdieTomer @JWPascale A caller asks, should Metro have their own ride hailing app so that Uber and Lyft don't have too many drivers on the road and thus reduce driver fares?
@AdieTomer @JWPascale "The suburbs are the battleground for these innovations," says @AdieTomer on where public transit and ride hailing company partnerships will work best.
@AdieTomer @JWPascale Erik Johanson, of @SEPTA says, "Uber partnership was particularly helpful in the suburbs."
@AdieTomer @JWPascale "A ton of experimentation is happening with transit partnerships," says @AdieTomer
@AdieTomer @JWPascale "No one size fits all for public transit partnerships with ride hailing companies," says @AdieTomer
@AdieTomer @JWPascale "Transportation is about habits and human behavior," says @JWPascale

@anitamreyes @Lara_Schwartz Thanks for listening to today's show! What questions are you mulling?
@h36150906_jo Thankful for you, dear listener!
For some, "civility" is not primarily about finding common humanity, but about being an active citizen and calling out injustice.		A thread by @Lara_Schwartz: 	https://t.co/liwrgZp2VU
"One aspect of civil discourse is not telling people who they are." - @Lara_Schwartz. 	https://t.co/WBfUFRDOHD
"We love a silver bullet. But there's no one answer to this problem. Getting people to sit down together, if you're focused more on questions than persuading, allows us to recognize the humanity of the other side." - @HowardJRoss	https://t.co/WBfUFRDOHD
@PinkLineProject organizes dinner parties for people of different political beliefs. 		She's "not there to persuade anybody" and yet, human nature takes over, and her guests wind up debating each other. 	https://t.co/WBfUFRDOHD
When entering a debate with someone you disagree with, @Lara_Schwartz says to ask yourself: What is it we actually want to accomplish? 		"You can't agree with people when you don't want to accomplish the same things." https://t.co/WBfUFRDOHD
"It's gone from 'I disagree with you' to 'You're one of those kind of people.'" says @HowardJRoss	on divisiveness in society.	https://t.co/WBfUFRDOHD
Civility is ___________ ?		"A set of rules," says @PinkLineProject.		"It's a purpose-driven idea," says @Lara_Schwartz.		"We each have a set of ideas of what civility is," says @HowardJRoss.	https://t.co/WBfUFRDOHD
