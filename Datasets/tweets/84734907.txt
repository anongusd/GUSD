13/ Civil rights lawyers are fighting back right now against 11th hour attempts to suppress voting rights in #Midterms2018. Voters should feel empowered and continue exercising the most sacred right in our democracy. 		Report #votersuppression to @866OURVOTE. @lawyerscomm
12/ Vote fraud is a myth and a LIE. One study by Justin Levitt found just 31 incidents of voter impersonation fraud out of over 1 billion votes cast in 14 years. Meanwhile, voter suppression is rampant (GA, KS, TX, NC, FL, etc..) and this DOJ has done nothing. Not a SINGLE case.
11/ There are also state laws that specifically prohibit Trump-style law enforcement intimidation of voters. Cal. Elec. Code ¬ß 18544 imposes criminal penalties on cops posted at a polling place and laws in Pennsylvania and Tennessee impose restrictions on cop activity as well.
10/ Section 11(b) of the Voting Rights Act bars conduct deemed intimidating, threatening or coercive to voters. If Trump's conduct leads to law enforcement intimidation of voters, we have federal laws that can be used to stop them. @866OURVOTE @LawyersComm
9/ There are federal laws that prohibit the kind of voter suppression that Trump seeks to inspire like Sct 1971 (b) of the Civil Rights Act of 1957 which says no person "shall intimidate, threaten or coerce ... any other person" to interfere with their right to vote. @866OURVOTE
8/  In 2016, radical, fringe groups like the Oath Keepers appealed to its members, mostly former military and police, to go undercover at polling sites and collect intelligence about possible fraud. These are the types who Trump seeks to appeal to now. https://t.co/wyk8lp1xyl
7/ Trump resorted to similar tactics back in 2016 when he called for ‚Äòelection watchers‚Äô to go out and look for 'suspicious' things. This is all about polarizing our country and keeping communities of color home on Election Day. We see right through it. https://t.co/N6auoQGhRN
6/ In  2000, cops in N. Florida set up a driver‚Äôs license check point near a polling site with a large Black population. After being exposed, the check point was shut down		I personally saw similar law enforcement activity at the polls in Louisiana while serving as a DOJ monitor
5/ Trump's statements seeks to inspire ugly conduct like what we saw in Arizona in 2006 when anti-immigrant activists w/ guns on their side and badge like emblems tried to intimidate Latino voters. Voters should report bullies at the polls to 866-OUR-VOTE. https://t.co/x4jFVTCKC8
4/ Jeff Sessions tried this voter intimidation scheme as a prosecutor back in Alabama. He pursued baseless prosecutions of Black activists for simply registering people to vote. They were quickly acquitted but the chilling effect was undeniable. https://t.co/tuvj06jNSO
3/ In 1963, Bull Connor ordered police to use force to halt more than I000 African American students marching in Birmingham for the right to vote. Demonstrators were blasted by high-pressure fire hoses, clubbed by cops, and attacked by dogs.
2/ James Clark used his police force to intimidate Black people who tried to register to vote at the courthouse in Selma, Alabama. In 1965, only 300 of the city's 15K potential black voters were registered. Clark ordered the arrests of activists. https://t.co/tge3VqCdTz
1/ Trump's statement dangling the threat of law enforcement prosecution of voters is an old and dirty trick right out of the Jim Crow playbook. It's shameful that in 2018, we have a President resorting to Bull Connor-type tactics to keep people of color away from the polls. https://t.co/0ZUS4TSXRN
