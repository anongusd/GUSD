@HerMaitre @lshirky @RiggsyDiggsy @WarrenDavidson How exactly does ICE keep track of those who entered illegally if they don't know they entered?
@HerMaitre @lshirky @RiggsyDiggsy @WarrenDavidson How can you say that when we don't know how many "undocumented" aliens are here? Hence the "undocumented" portion of their description. Even minimal estimates don't support your claim. The best estimates put Visa overstays at roughly half the number of illegals currently here.
@jazz_inmypants @BenShapQuotes @benshapiro That's the best news I've heard all day.
@drnifkin @SarahPalinUSA Maybe you should read on past the headline.

@SpeakerPelosi Yes @SpeakerPelosi #EndTheShutdown and fund the damn wall.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump We want a wall. Not because we hate anyone. Because we must protect our own first. Maybe use some of the money we're pouring into federal aide to countries that hate us and chant death to America while we build their infrastructure.

@conservmillen She said to turn on the tv. I asked which channel. She said it doesn't matter. I did. I cried all day.
@conservmillen I was a 21y/o single mom. I had worked night shift and had just gotten my 1 y/o son back down for a nap so I could take one. I had just closed my eyes and the phone rang. I ignored it the first time. When it started ringing a second time, I got up. My sister was crying.

@BreitbartNews The man has the right to paint whatever he wants to under freedom of speech. We're free to think he's a jackass trying to stay relevant under that same freedom of speech.
@benshapiro This makes me sad
@DeplorableChoir @jack Well, would you look at that?
