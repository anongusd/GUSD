@erik_inman46 It will help the immigration problem people continue to have an issue with. How do you stop people from coming to your country? You make their country worth living in.
@erik_inman46 We will have to do something about the cartels within the government. But again, what they do about it is beyond me at this point.
@erik_inman46 I think the US and Latin American governments can do better together to combat the cartels, though, yes. Overthrowing their government seems like an unnecessary step.
@erik_inman46 Haha I don‚Äôt think either of us know the answers to those country‚Äôs problems but I get the feeling war and colonialism wont solve it.
RT @ZerlinaMaxwell: Maybe they will show Melania where the girls and babies are
@erik_inman46 It became our MO when we colonialized half the world and took powerful stances in all international organizations I guess. If you don‚Äôt like responsibility go to Finland or something.
@erik_inman46 All I‚Äôm saying is that if you don‚Äôt want to help create a better world for those people to live in then you have no right to have a problem with them coming to the US. If you want people to stop knocking on your door, give them their own.
@erik_inman46 And I understand people don‚Äôt want to do that, but at least it may fix the problem rather than wasting money annually trying to combat it.
@erik_inman46 However all of these issues would be irrelevant if we just fixed their countries so they want to stay. I believe that is the only way to ‚Äúfix‚Äù immigration in our country.
@erik_inman46 And for the people that aren‚Äôt going to the checkpoints, at this point they are either scared of having to go back to where they came from or being separated from their family. They are desperate and if I were in their shoes I would do the same thing.
@erik_inman46 The issue is some of these people are going to a designated point, being put in these centers until their paperwork is processed, which can take years. And within these centers have been reports of inhumane treatment.
@erik_inman46 I think you are incorrectly generalizing Latin American refugees as drug cartels at this point. Or else I‚Äôm just not understanding the connection. Still not sure your information on the EU is entirely accurate, the 6 mos thing was a part of the temp legislature.
@erik_inman46 Also, their borders have absolutely nothing at them now. I didn‚Äôt even realize when I changed countries half the time here.  So I think they are an entirely different level than the US to begin with.
@erik_inman46 I see two problems with that article.  1. It was a temporary fix to have a long term discussion that expired in May this year. From what I know nothing further was implemented. 	2. The purpose was to combat terrorism, not Latin American‚Äôs seeking refuge.
RT @laurenduca: Today Kirstjen Nielsen drafted executive action to end the policy of family separation that she said did not exist less tha‚Ä¶
@erik_inman46 Not saying that because I‚Äôm an expert in borders now that I‚Äôve officially done it myself, but I talked with several students over here I studied with about their open borders and they said they aren‚Äôt considering making t stricter and crime isn‚Äôt a problem.
@erik_inman46 If we reallocate That money I‚Äôm not sure what you are suggesting happens to individuals that cross the border, which is why I said that. I‚Äôve crossed four borders in the matter of a day here in Europe and no one here is trying to make it stricter. Crime is at an all-time low.
The people bitching about tax money going into housing undocumented immigrants are the same people that want to waste tax money on a wall and that‚Äôs pretty confusing if you ask me
@erik_inman46 I think the only way that is possible is to create a national education system, but that would involve raising taxes which most of America is not for. I‚Äôd pay more taxes to ensure the generations of the future were more educated, though.
@erik_inman46 If you don‚Äôt think money should go towards our immigration system then you are all for open borders. We maintain border security through government tax dollars. I just think it would be wiser to put our money into the real problem, rather than a wall or detention centers.
@erik_inman46 They are already paying billions of dollars to the private prisons of your tax money I see no reason why it can‚Äôt be reallocated and you not have to pay any more in taxes
@erik_inman46 Or we can spend the billions of dollars we are giving to private prisons to detain them on rehabilitating their countries so they don‚Äôt have to flee in the first place
@erik_inman46 We could also put them in school if the other option wasn‚Äôt protectionist enough for you
@erik_inman46 If you‚Äôve known about this since the day you were born idk why you‚Äôve waited until now to bitch about it tbh
@erik_inman46 I have never once said that any of our immigration policies are glistening. I‚Äôve voiced outrage about the same problem with kids being displaced in sex trafficking as well. Can‚Äôt be mad about it til you know about it, unfortunately.
@erik_inman46 Well 1. I wasn‚Äôt alive and 2. These child camps and separation started happening this year from the zero tolerance legislation. There may be fake photos out there but there are also lots of real ones that you should go check out
@erik_inman46 LOL Donald Trump is waving the whole situation over Democrats heads saying if they don‚Äôt step aside and let the republicans make partisan legislation then it will continue, you have no reason to be sippin your tea bud that‚Äôs fucked

@eubanks_dane Girls not feeling confident in their bodies because there is an unrealistic beauty standard is fucked and a huge problem in the United States that I‚Äôm truly not sure why you‚Äôre advocating against it?
@eubanks_dane If you think beauty is being a size two and in a swim suit you‚Äôre the problem. If you think values of an organization are gender specific you are also the problem. If you think being progressive to change social norms is bad then you‚Äôre old fashioned and closed minded.

@jeremyaparicio You can sell pyramid schemes all you want
@jeremyaparicio This isn‚Äôt about you it‚Äôs about a principle
@eubanks_dane I‚Äôll send you an update everytime bud
@eubanks_dane I don‚Äôt need you to work hard so I don‚Äôt sell pyramid schemes, because I will work hard so I dont have to tell pyramid schemes. ALL I ASK IS THAT MEN QUIT THE PATRONIZING ACT THAT WE NEED HELP BC WE DONT
@eubanks_dane LIKE WHEN DOUCHEBAGS SAY THEY ARE GONNA WORK SO HARD SO THEIR WIFE DOESNT HAVE TO SELL PYRAMID SCHEMES
@eubanks_dane I never once mentioned a law so there‚Äôs a bad argument. But there is a thing called systematic oppression and considering women just got the right to vote in the past century there is no doubt that remnants of sexism are still alive. I see it every day.
@eubanks_dane I don‚Äôt understand why I have to be a man to not get treated like I cannot fend for myself
@eubanks_dane And I don‚Äôt want to be a man, I want to be a woman that is treated equally as a man - and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs too fucking much to ask
@eubanks_dane I think that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre confused. No one debates he science behind sex. People have differentiated sex and gender. Gender being a social construct, and sex being the anatomy you are born with. So no ones arguing with you there.
@eubanks_dane But if you want to talk about science we can talk plenty of science that doesn‚Äôt align with your beliefs... I got ALL day
@erik_inman46 You‚Äôre right, guess I shouldn‚Äôt have been so extreme. I was clearly triggered lol
@eubanks_dane Science has nothing to do with being sexist. I open the door for plenty of people because I like to think I‚Äôm a decent human being. My point was don‚Äôt belittle women to say that they cannot make their own living without the support of a man. Give me the algorithm to that.
@eubanks_dane Plz
@erik_inman46 Yes I realize women are predominantly in pyramid schemes. This was a preemptive attack on the inevitable comment that only women sell pyramid schemes
So just know that next time you think tweeting something about providing for your woman is a good idea... Remember she can provide for her damn self she‚Äôs grown.
Bc I remember all the guys who sold knives in high school and I do NOT wanna hear JACK SHIT about pyramid schemes. EVER.
Do NOT @ me about this until you @ all the men who think women are purely incapable of making money for themselves to the point they don‚Äôt have to sell pyramid schemes.
I‚Äôm gonna work my ass off so my man never has to sell pyramid schemes
I‚Äôm like fluffy in Harry Potter. Music puts me to sleep so quick and I‚Äôm nice and peaceful, but if you wake me up I WILL rip your head off and that‚Äôs just a fact.

@erik_inman46 I agree with you, but it‚Äôs not all news outlets. It‚Äôs unfortunate that any are like that, but it‚Äôs up to the consumers to know what‚Äôs true, and to hold the subjective ones accountable
@erik_inman46 Minded people to write opinion pieces, so even our opinion section has a diverse range of viewpoints.
@erik_inman46 We stray away from allowing subjectivity in any article we publish. We have an opinion section for that, as do many papers. In that opinion section we allow columnists to express right- and left- pieces. In fact I have asked more conservative...
@erik_inman46 So when you say the media has an agenda, I do disagree. Because although CNN and Fox and other news sites seems to have a collapsed objecivity, doesn‚Äôt mean every news outlet does.
@erik_inman46 I think ‚Äúthe media‚Äù encompasses much more than CNN and Fox News.   And I think that majority of people have a mind of their own, and they need to use that mind of their own to be intelligent consumers when processing news from ‚Äúthe media.‚Äù

@emilyforby @Eubankles @cmead9494 Reggie and I have a very similar opinion on the matter, actually, and had an outside conversation about it.
@emilyforby @Eubankles @cmead9494 Reggie tagged me to clearly learn about the topic and have a debate. Clearly you needed to learn a little something about it too.
@emilyforby @Eubankles @cmead9494 I‚Äôve already written to my representstives, you should do the same.
@emilyforby @Eubankles @cmead9494 If we are going to listen to anyone about whether or not we should push this into a political argument, I say listen to the ones that faced the tragedy firsthand and not hide behind the falsehood that they don‚Äôt want to discuss it.
@emilyforby @Eubankles @cmead9494 And, if you look at the students who were in the high school, the ones with the true trauma from what occurred, they are the main leaders behind the push for change.  They have appeared on the news, have been active on social media, and are organizing to talk to Trump.
@emilyforby @Eubankles @cmead9494 If we as a country don‚Äôt act on it now, while we can still feel the impact of what happened, it‚Äôs going to be pushed to the back again.  Another school shooting about happened today in centralia, mo. Idk how long you want to wait, but it will keep happening until change is made.
@emilyforby @Eubankles @cmead9494 I really don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúyou people‚Äù means, but I think everyone is seeking a change in trends away from school shootings. No one actually wants them to happen, some people are seeking that change through policy.  Because SOME PEOPLE don‚Äôt want to just wait for the next one.

@ckmarshall10 @jake_miller96 I can respect that, I appreciate the conversation.
@ckmarshall10 @jake_miller96 And yes, I realize those three do not represent the entire body of DACA recipients.
@ckmarshall10 @jake_miller96 DACA is a program that revolves around the fact they were brought here when they were minors.  SEVERAL, not all, but several - and I would dare say a majority - were brought to the United States under the age of 10. The three DACA recipients I know all came when they were 1 &amp; 2.
@jake_miller96 @ckmarshall10 These children literally came over when they were 4.  They hardly had time to create themselves a criminal record in their home countries.
@jake_miller96 @ckmarshall10 AGAIN WITH THE GENERALIZATIONS THAT THEY ARE CRIMINALS. THEY ARE NOT.
@ckmarshall10 @jake_miller96 They are escaping the political unrest in their countries that, in large part, has been started by the United States. The political unrest that is so violent that they risk their lives and futures to come to America to live as lower class citizens just to survive.
@ckmarshall10 @jake_miller96 Recipients of DACA were brought over when they were children. They virtually would have no record or recollection of their home country.
@ckmarshall10 @jake_miller96 I‚Äôm talking about DACA in which case their criminal record is from the US.
@jake_miller96 @ckmarshall10 I‚Äôm not avoiding questions.  I‚Äôm simply stating the fact that generalizing undocumented immigrants to be murderers in innately wrong, and something Donald Trump did tonight. I don‚Äôt advocate for any death, but are you advocating to end immigration entirely?
@ckmarshall10 @jake_miller96 Sounds oddly similar to what happened in the very beginning of the establishment of this country.
@ckmarshall10 @jake_miller96 The DACA program requires no criminal record, as does becoming a citizen to those not within the program.  There are honest citizens working hard and paying income taxes they see no benefit from just to escape oppression of their home country
@ckmarshall10 @jake_miller96 Even those percentages are entirely too high, the risk you stand on being physically attacked by any undocumented immigrant is much lower percentage-wise than being attacked by any citizen to begin with.  There are several criminals that are United States citizens, too.
@jake_miller96 40 percent of undocumented immigrants are not in gangs or are convicted murderers, unlike popular belief. So let‚Äôs stop generalizing them to be.
I would like to address the fact that not all undocumented immigrants are part of dangerous gangs, nor are convicted murderers/terrorists, unlike popular belief. So can we please stop generalizing them to be? #SOTU

@jake_miller96 not saying it does, but that's an example.
@jake_miller96 I am a female, but I should be able to join Boy Scouts as a female because that organization fits my interests more
@jake_miller96 this is not what this is about at all.
@jake_miller96 crazy how that works
@jake_miller96 BC HISTORICALLY IT IS FOR THOSE GENDERS BUT IT DOESNT NEED TO CONTINUE ON THAT WAY
@jake_miller96 keep your misogynistic views of gender roles out of people's lives, how bout that ü§î
@jake_miller96 no issues there.  Didn't grow a dick or anything!!!!!
@jake_miller96 I took a rockets class when I was younger that was "suggested for boys" and was the only girl
@jake_miller96 that makes absolutely no sense.  There are girls that like Girl Scouts the way it is
@jake_miller96 why change an organization to meet the needs of one human when there is already and organization that does that
@jake_miller96 my girls can join the org if they want, just like boys can if they want.
@jake_miller96 yeah Girl Scouts is probably saying the same thing.
@jake_miller96 there's not a need to join Boy Scouts in general..... to anyone.... regardless of gender....
@jake_miller96 or maybe it's just you who needs to make the change?
@jake_miller96 That's a little extreme.  As soon as you have a Tom-boy daughter are you going to ostracize her and tell her to grow a penis?
@jake_miller96 I can't change Girl Scouts, it's not up to me.  There's an over reigning organization.
@jake_miller96 why would I join an all black organization?  To learn about the culture and develop new skills.
@jake_miller96 if my daughter wanted to join Boy Scouts because of their activities and mission I would allow her 100%
@jake_miller96 it's based on its history and mission.  Historically, it does more "boy" activities.  Doesn't mean girls can't participate.
@jake_miller96 yeah and I'm in an organization called national association for black journalists... doesn't mean I can't be in it.
@jake_miller96 I don't see why a boy can't join Girl Scouts?  No point changing an organization's values and mission to be exclusive

@erik_inman46 @Tzbuck71 @realDonaldTrump we shouldn't need check and balances to protect us from our president.

@jake_miller96 if trump says it's all corrupt why is he so against a recount in states to ensure the election was correct?

I'm not condoning violence but the fact that he ostracizes groups of people for using their rights (with peaceful protests) is unreal
