Today, on #InternationalWomensDay2018, we recognize the many achievements of women around the world &amp; the sacrifices of those who have come before us.

President Trump’s budget would close Rochester’s Laboratory for Laser Energetics (LLE). LLE is an essential component of the @DOE, @NNSA, and the @ICF ‘s High Yield Campaign. We can’t afford to lose it! https://t.co/cuMD1A8YkT
Today, March 5th, was President Trump's deadline for #DACA. Six months later nothing's changed. As Ranking Member of the Rules Committee, I’ve tried to force a vote on this issue more than 20 times, but the Majority has not allowed a single vote. We can't afford to wait! https://t.co/JzOjfSE6PV
What do Oscar-winning movies Dunkirk, Call Me By Your Name, Phantom Thread, and I, Tonya all have in common? They were made with Kodak film produced in Rochester! Kodak is just one example of the role our local companies play nationally. https://t.co/cSYXhl2b6r

Due to our efforts and the success I’ve had in creating this opportunity and bringing it to Rochester, our community is now at the very center of world-wide efforts to harness the power of photonics, which will drive technology, daily life, and our economy for decades to come.
Let there be light! I was proud to see the progress being made at the Test, Assembly and Packaging facility today. We are doing something that is challenging: we’re working together to build a manufacturing institute that is both transformational and built to last.
The winter storm is continuing across our region, canceling many activities and making travel difficult. More than a foot of snow has already fallen but the number of power outages in the county appear to have stabilized. Please stay safe out there! #ROC
This situation endangers our national security. It’s time for Jared Kushner to go. https://t.co/GcclqPrkft
No individual with such extensive, previously undisclosed foreign contacts and dealings should be allowed anywhere near top-secret information.
According to news reports, a number of nations have sought to use their business relationship with him to assert leverage over White House decision-making.
Jared Kushner’s complex foreign business entanglements and relationship with the president is making him a target for countries abroad, including China and the United Arab Emirates.
Voila! The moment you’ve all been waiting for: here’s the restored clock from #Rochester’s 1914 New York Central Station—remembering the old and rejoicing in the new! https://t.co/h8NAW5fpIO
I’ll be visiting our new train station this afternoon to unveil it, displayed for all visitors to see. It will be a testament to our past as we look to the future with our new state-of-the-art train station!
One lead would lead to another after conversations with archivists, historical societies, antique dealers, and railway officials. Now, this clock from the early 1900’s has been fully restored and is back in working order.
Back in August, I announced that my office had located the Master Clock from Rochester’s 1914 New York Central Station. It was a remarkable discovery. https://t.co/ObnlMx4hl1 #ROC

@YWCA_Rochester We’re seeing a true cultural shift that’s forcing many institutions, from the U.S. Military to the NFL, to address domestic violence. That’s why we need to reauthorize this landmark legislation before it expires in September to continue giving survivors the services they need.
@YWCA_Rochester It has reduced cases of domestic violence by 67 percent since 1994 and helped change the conversation surrounding domestic violence. No longer is this issue solely a private matter that goes undiscussed in the media or the halls of Congress.
This afternoon, I’ll be touring @YWCA_Rochester and discussing the importance of Congress and President Trump quickly reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Co-authoring this law is one of the most important accomplishments of my career.
There is so much more that must be done but the Majority in Congress won’t even allow an open debate on commonsense proposals that could keep our kids and family members safe.
As I said then, thoughts and prayers alone are not enough – we need action to combat the gun violence epidemic. While I’m pleased to see President Trump direct Attorney General Sessions to ban bump stocks administratively, I’m left to wonder what took so long.
I’ve been a cosponsor of H.R. 3947, the Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act, to ban bump stocks since October. That’s when a shooter used a bump stock to target concert goers in Las Vegas in what became the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.
Did you know that New York State ranks third highest in the nation for the number of African American-owned firms? I will continue to support businesses that strengthen our local economy and make #ROC a great place to work &amp; live. #celebratingBlackHistory https://t.co/6jnA2PV4uc

Our simplest job in Congress is to keep American families safe. A long-term budget deal must consider what kind of world we are leaving behind for our kids and grandkids. I urge Republicans in Congress to reject the extreme #DirtyBudget. We must defend people, not polluters.

It’s unconscionable that #POTUS continues to drag his feet &amp; it begs the question: how far will he go to protect #Putin?

Thankfully, the #TrumpBudget request stands little to no chance of being enacted.
#POTUS campaigned on protecting hardworking &amp; middle-class Americans but his actual proposal flies in the face of that pledge while further indebting our nation by $7 trillion &amp; cutting key programs like student aid, #Medicare, #Medicaid &amp; transportation by billions of dollars.
What’s worse, it does nothing to balance the $1.5 trillion hole the #GOPTaxScam created &amp; fails to comply with the bipartisan budget agreement Congress passed last week.
The #TrumpBudget is one of the most ill-conceived I’ve seen and his proposed cuts would devastate countless domestic priorities that so many families count on.
Just finished a press event in my #ROC office! Thank you to the leaders from our Community Health Centers and Dr. Bidlack from URMC for coming in to talk about your important work. https://t.co/BiNvR1uTTe
Thanks to their efforts we haven’t seen a single regional crash since. Our skies are safer today because of them.
They continue to turn their grief into powerful action by traveling to and from Washington, D.C., often at their personal expense, to protect the safeguards they secured. I’m proud to stand with them now and always.
9 years ago, our nation experienced a devastating plane accident that impacted so many families across WNY. Through unspeakable tragedy, the #Flight3407 families pushed Congress &amp; the @FAANews to learn from their loss &amp; create reforms that better protect travelers.
.@HouseGOP has tried repeatedly to limit the #CFPB’s ability to protect consumers &amp; now they’re getting their wish. It's unconscionable that Director Mulvaney, appointed by #POTUS, is preparing to defang this institution &amp; eviscerate consumer protections. https://t.co/JgZ8Rrt6lz
There are 44 million people in the U.S. who owe a combined $1.3 trillion in student debt. In fact, the bill’s sponsor called students’ debt a “luxurious hammock.” Our young people are our future and we should be making it easier for them to attain degrees, not harder.

In this country, we hold parades to honor our veterans, not our political leaders. Rather than waste taxpayer money for his own personal amusement the president should invest in our veterans and their families.
If #PresidentTrump wanted to see our nation’s military might up-close, maybe he shouldn’t have sought five deferments during the Vietnam War, a time when he was busy playing sports like football and tennis.

Just like stock trades or financial assets, members of Congress must report #bitcoins &amp; #cryptocurrencies on their financial disclosure forms under the STOCK Act. That’s why I’m calling on the House Ethics Cmte to issue formal instructions on this matter. https://t.co/ihTFBpt3pO

Only during WWII was our debt a higher percentage of gross domestic product than it is right now. I hope this puts to rest once and for all the myth that the Majority is the party of fiscal discipline.
#POTUS has called himself the King of Debt. Well, his administration is on track to borrow nearly $1 trillion this year. That’s nearly twice as much as the previous year and due to the #GOPTaxScam for the wealthy and large corporations. https://t.co/L9CkspBz38
The buying &amp; selling of #bitcoins &amp; other cryptocurrencies are no different, which is why the cmte should issue formal instructions on this matter. The public deserves to know whether federal officials are upholding the public trust &amp; adhering to the highest ethical standards.
I wrote this law to protect against insider trading and ensure that federal officials weren’t using their positions of power to pad their own pockets.
Today I’m calling on the House Ethics Committee to make it crystal clear that members of Congress are required to report #cryptocurrency assets on their financial disclosure forms under the STOCK Act. https://t.co/3RWQ7fXjvV
I’m proud to have supported the CAA Reform Act, which passed the House today. For too long, members of Congress have been allowed to use taxpayer resources to pay settlements resulting from their awful exploitations of power. This bill is a big step in the right direction.
I’m at the Rules Cmte calling out @HouseGOP’s 5th short term solution for funding the government since September. Failing to develop a long-term &amp; bipartisan solution that tackles our country’s priorities is shameful and it speaks volumes about the #GOP's inability to govern. https://t.co/Etyta70FMd

The entire country better hope this does not lead to the firing of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, which is the intent of releasing this memo, along with trying to stop Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation.
The Democratic memo should be immediately released with appropriate redactions to protect national security so the public can get the full picture.
The security agencies have been working to figure out what Carter Page was up to long before the 2016 campaign or any dossier was ever compiled.

The American people deserve to know whether federal officials are upholding the public trust and adhering to the highest ethical standards, or using their powerful positions to enrich themselves.
This latest development is just one of many examples of the #Trumpadministration’s deep ties to big corporations and significant financial conflicts of interest.
As a result of the STOCK Act and the work of a strong press, we know that #BrendaFitzgerald made several questionable stock trades that posed serious conflicts of interests given her position leading the @CDCgov. https://t.co/teBsQgygn2

Decisions like this by #POTUS continue to make one wonder - how far is President Trump willing to go to protect Putin?
Just over a year ago, 17 federal intelligence agencies unanimously confirmed that Russia meddled in the #2016election. Yet, #POTUS still refuses to admit that and instead attacks these very agencies.
This move by #POTUS disregards bipartisan legislation that overwhelmingly passed the House &amp; Senate last summer and was signed into law by #POTUS. The president’s ties to Russia are troubling to say the least and are the subject of multiple investigations. https://t.co/m4acnbSyBh
Tonight the president will give his #SOTU. Here’s my statement on #whyiwearblack: https://t.co/DNUweAPxDj

When #POTUS looks into the gallery during the speech, I want him to see Dustin – a proud Army Reservist – and the impacts of his broken promises.
Companies are continuing to lay off workers with some even using #taxcuts on stock buybacks that help their wealthy executives rather than creating jobs. It’s proof that this #TaxScam was designed to help the wealthy and not our workers.
I’m pleased to host Dustin Newman as my guest for #POTUS’ #SOTU. Despite the promises made by #POTUS and the #GOP that the #TaxScam would help companies create jobs, Dustin’s story is just one example of the reality that we’re seeing across the country.

There were no winners here. But I’m proud to cast this vote to end the #GOPshutdown so the country can get back to work.
I’ve said before that there were no Democratic fingerprints anywhere to be found on the prior #ContinuingResolution that failed in the Senate last week. Now that Democrats were finally offered a seat at the table, cooler heads have prevailed.
There have now been five Republican #governmentshutdowns in less than 30 years. This shutdown was a direct result of the Republicans being unable to run the government. It caused great disruption and pain for no reason.
No one wanted to see the great government of the United States closed for business. The last #GOPshutdown in 2013 cost our economy an estimated $24 billion and brought everything from federal research to reducing the backlog of veterans’ disability claims to a standstill.
It’s been 45 years since #roevwade protected a woman’s constitutional right to have an abortion. Although #POTUS and the #GOP are dead set of rolling back #reprorights, I am committed to continue fighting against every anti-choice policy they send our way. #7in10forRoe https://t.co/jHV3JJAsO5
.@wapo reported that #POTUS spent the weekend asking aides if he should try to end the #shutdown. I find that both remarkable and sad. In the midst of a true crisis, the President of the United States wonders aloud if he should lead or keep watching TV. https://t.co/WO188LToth
To my #Republican colleagues: there is too much at stake for the people that we serve. This high-stakes game of chicken must end.
Tomorrow is Monday and it will mark a new and dangerous turn in the #TrumpShutdown, with hundreds of thousands of Americans unable to return to work. The 2013 #GOPshutdown stopped 850,000 employees from getting their paychecks and cost our economy $24 billion in just 16 days.
I’m on the floor right now demanding @HouseGOP &amp; @SenateGOP step up, do their jobs, &amp; create a comprehensive plan to tackle our nation’s most urgent priorities. The American people cannot &amp; should not have to watch while the #GOP continues to govern irresponsibly. #TrumpShutdown https://t.co/4czK5bJoV2

Like my Democratic colleagues, I am still in Washington, D.C. ready to craft a comprehensive, bipartisan plan for addressing the needs of the American people. Time is up. Republicans must get to work.
Our great government is closed for business. This is the first time in history that the government has shut down when a single party controls the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives.
It’s time for my #Republican colleagues to stop this high-risk game of chicken and work together with Democrats on addressing the needs of the American people. https://t.co/s40etFxkTa
#GOP leaders have had more than 100 days to meet Dems at the negotiating table and create a comprehensive plan to tackle our nation’s most urgent priorities.

In a few minutes, the House will vote on #HR4712, @HouseGOP’s latest assault on women’s #reprorights. We are just hours away from a #governmentshutdown and what does the Majority choose to focus on? Undermining women’s constitutionally-protected #righttochoose. https://t.co/eDTdILjWQf
The #GOP controls Washington, and yet they fail to tackle major legislative issues while lurching from crisis to crisis. As yet another #governmentshutdown creeps closer, the #GOP must finally decide if they will do their jobs and govern responsibly. https://t.co/rYUlCjRJJR
#HR4712 is the latest bill in @HouseGOP’s never-ending attack on women’s #reprorights. With the litany of legislative priorities before us, it amazes me that attacking a woman’s #righttochoose is at the top of the #GOP’s to-do list. https://t.co/FU58uKNUAx

Today marks 8 years since an earthquake rocked #Haiti, causing an estimated 200,000 deaths and forever impacting millions more. The devastation was so great that rebuilding continues to this day. The perseverance #Haitians have shown in the face of such tragedy is an inspiration.
#POTUS is once again preventing an immigrant woman from accessing her constitutionally-protected #reprorights. To be clear: the law provides her this right. It’s yet another example of #POTUS forcing a woman to continue her pregnancy against her will. #JusticeforJane https://t.co/1MrWW9fRrP
It’s disappointing to see #POTUS hold nearly 700,000 #DREAMers hostage while continuing to demand millions in funding for his ill-conceived #BorderWall. Deporting these hard-working young people to fulfill a political talking point is awful &amp; runs counter to American values. https://t.co/Lm23fuRcH0
Keep sending in your #survey responses! Already, I've received thousands of replies about your thoughts on the most important issues facing #ROC and our nation. More information here: https://t.co/4p6wkRXBmq
I’m disappointed to see #POTUS use these hard-working young people as bargaining chips for his expensive &amp; offensive border wall. These are real people contributing in real ways to this country and it’s time their government do what they promised and protect them #ProtectDREAMAct https://t.co/Bk8acKIp0B
Yesterday's ruling gives hope to the more than 100 #DREAMers who were losing their protective status every day thanks to #POTUS’ proposed elimination of this program. Nationwide, nearly 700,000 DREAMers will be forced to leave if Congress fails to codify this program into law.
Pleased that the transcript from the @SenJudiciary interview with the founder of #FusionGPS is finally seeing the light of day thanks to @SenFeinstein. The public has the right to know what was said as the investigation into the 2016 campaign continues https://t.co/THAohO4guE
It’s a #NewYear at the Rules Cmte, but @HouseGOP are up to the same old procedural ploys. Last night, I opened our first meeting by calling out their record-breaking pace of closed rules and slamming @SpeakerRyan for his refusal to allow open and honest debate. More here: https://t.co/1TRLrSqSip
Proud to share the cover of the @wpmagazine with Anita Hill &amp; other trailblazing women. Sadly this conversation on #sexualharassment is as relevant as ever. I’m going to keep leading the fight in Congress and standing with all women as this reckoning  continues. https://t.co/LZVg4qoCls
Last year @HouseGOP broke their own record for closed rules, issuing 58 in just 12 months. It’s outrageous that despite the New Year, @SpeakerRyan is up to the same old misguided procedural maneuvers.
Heading to the Rules Cmte to consider the first bill of the #NewYear. No surprise, the bill will be considered under a closed rule, which block amendments from Dems &amp; Republicans, abuse the legislative process &amp; silence the voices of reps sent here to represent their communities.
This troubling report on the effect the #OpioidEpidemic is having on #ROC is just further proof that Congress must come together and pass my bills, the Pharmaceutical Stewardship Act &amp; the Overprescribing for Pain Act. https://t.co/GRT3lWChF3
#ICYMI, last night’s @60minutes highlighted what I’ve been saying for years: blast overpressure is a serious and sustained public health issue for our #veterans and we must take immediate action to combat it. https://t.co/lZnd1oTNcw
#Congress heads back to D.C. today to address looming deadlines and tackle the litany of legislative priorities the #GOP left unfinished in 2017. It’s a new year and already they're overdue on their promise to take on and fix critical national priorities. https://t.co/lxBkDMEZVb
Earlier this year I met Gregg and William -reps from the @buffalobills- and showed off my office’s signed Jim Kelly helmet! It’s been 17 years since the Bills made it to @NFL playoffs and I know I speak for (most of!) #ROC when I say I’ll be cheering them on this weekend! https://t.co/Hs13uRe4LN
The upcoming winter storm is expected to bring ice, snow, and bone-chilling temps. Make sure you’re prepared &amp; stay safe out there, #ROC! https://t.co/8oFpX9eNlV
(4/4) #POTUS’ worse impulses should not come before keeping American families safe.
(3/4) I’ve co-sponsored the Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act, which would enhance global stability and prohibit President Trump or any #POTUS from conducting a first-use nuclear weapon strike without a Congressional Declaration of War.
(2/4) As President Reagan said in his 1984 State of the Union address, “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.”
(1/4) Taunting hostile foreign powers over Twitter is a disgraceful and dangerous way to govern. The situation in #NorthKorea is a serious one and should not be treated with reality show bluster. https://t.co/Nn1mdjnqNQ
(3/3) As a result, we haven't seen another fatal regional airline crash since. Ironically, these are the same standards that #POTUS and some Republicans in Congress are now trying to roll back. We cannot and will not let that happen.
(2/3) But they turned their grief into powerful action. Because of their tireless work – often traveling to D.C. at their own expense – Congress passed bipartisan airline safety standards mandating that every pilot, whether regional or commercial, is well-trained and well-rested.
(1/3) #POTUS should thank the #Flight3407 families. They faced immeasurable grief and loss that none of us can fully understand. https://t.co/NZP2zDYwrC

Proud to lead the @ProChoiceCaucus today in calling on @HouseJudiciary to further investigate recent moves by #POTUS to deny immigrant women access to their constitutional #righttochoose. https://t.co/130Tcqf7Pn
The #GOPTaxScam is set to wreak havoc for millions of people across the country while further enriching the super wealthy &amp; big corporations. I was proud to vote against it &amp; will continue to lead the fight in Congress for a tax code that actually benefits hard-working families. https://t.co/cxnK0TUaPe
Lucky for you, there’s no shortage of important debates these days in Congress! https://t.co/4uD0DpfQ1u
After squandering the last several weeks on a #taxscam to enrich the wealthy and corporate America, @HouseGOP is bringing forward a half-baked, short-term solution today to fund the government. Lurching from crisis to crisis is a shameful way to govern. https://t.co/PdU0ii5NMx
Today I offered @HouseGOP the chance to save the #ACA’s individual mandate and #SALT. Sadly, they refused and continued to barrel ahead with a #taxscam that will increase the deficit, hurt homeowners, and force 13 million to go without insurance. More here 🔽 https://t.co/YZ1bX3M72T
This morning I spoke on the floor about @HouseGOP’s failure to slow down and properly vet their deficit-exploding #TaxScam. Watch me here: https://t.co/xF7zrwapBX
RT @ProChoiceCaucus: This caucus condemns @HouseGOP efforts to insert divisive, anti-choice policies into the continuing resolution to fund…
.@HouseGOP was in such a rush to make the rich &amp; big corporations even richer with their deficit-exploding #taxbill that they made major mistakes and now the bill must come before the House for a second vote today. This is a shameful way to govern. https://t.co/4RRcO3TMJ8
I just voted against the #GOPTaxScam and I was proud to do it. Here’s why: https://t.co/K0irpTuLMt
.@HouseGOP says their bill helps the middle class, but instead it takes away deductions middle class families claim in order to give the wealthiest Americans and corporations permanent tax cuts.
Republicans in the House and Senate spent days rewriting their #GOPTaxScam behind closed doors. The result? A bill that gives 83% of the tax cuts to the top 1% of Americans. https://t.co/16ZIbs92Gt
I’m voting against the #GOPTaxScam conference report because it hikes taxes on 86 million middle-class families, takes away health coverage from 13 million Americans, and increases the deficit by $1.5 trillion. This is a bad deal for American families. https://t.co/tfYaOH0NZ8
Republicans are voting on the #GOPTaxScam conference report so they can sign it into law before Christmas. I’m voting no on raising taxes on 86 million middle-class families ahead of the holidays. RT if you agree.
Proud to take to the House Floor to defend the tens of millions of middle-class &amp; low-income families that will bear the brunt of the #GOP’s #TaxScam. https://t.co/u809byrskg
#GOPTaxScam raises taxes on 86 million middle class families, hands 83 percent of tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent.
This latest data from @iteptweets shows the #GOP #TaxScam for what it really is: a massive tax cut for the wealthy that leaves the poor &amp; middle-class to foot the bill. https://t.co/Gnl3CqgcmL
Thank you, @RBJdaily, for this tremendous honor! I’m sorry I can’t be there in person to accept the award. I am so grateful that you thought of me and for your great service to #ROC. https://t.co/xxPmmZzcWh
What lengths will #POTUS go to protect his public image? https://t.co/4AV1udihMu
Transgender. Fetus. Diversity. Vulnerable. Evidence-based. Science-based. Entitlement. 		The researchers at the @CDCgov have the right to feel incredulous. Allowing extreme ideologies to infect public health research is simply outrageous. https://t.co/GR7zR3XkNq
The #GOP #TaxScam goes out of its way to harm #NY by putting a cap on #SALT deductions. I will not stand for a bill that takes money out of the pockets of hard-working Americans and further enriches the wealthiest in our nation. https://t.co/AeM6jQJhr0
Who wins under the #GOP #TaxScam? We already know the answer: the wealthiest one percent &amp; big corporations that have been shipping good-paying jobs overseas for years. It’s past time the #GOP abandon their tax plan tunnel-vision. https://t.co/XB7TLmtJzz
When you sit down to watch the #LastJedi, you’ll be experiencing the work of one of #ROC’s most iconic companies—the movie was shot on @Kodak film made at @followEBP! https://t.co/DRPBiGuOqn

#GOP-appointed members of the @FCC just voted to abandon #netneutrality. It is a disgrace to our free &amp; open internet. The fight is not over, and you can count on me to do everything I can to make it right. https://t.co/K5qoHCql6I
Five years ago today, our nation witnessed a horrific act of violence at #SandyHook. Today we reflect on the 26 lives lost that day and recommit ourselves to working in every way possible to finally end the #gunviolence epidemic. #HonorWithAction https://t.co/XCEY2Ol1g4
RT @NancyPelosi: Republicans should think twice before voting for the #GOPTaxScam. Trickle down didn’t work before. It won’t work now. And…
Republican-appointed members of the @FCC should not get to restrict access to your content, slow down connection speeds, and have final say over what you see and say online. I’m opposed to this dangerous rollback of #NetNeutrality https://t.co/ieK4WMTveu
Drilling in the #ArcticRefuge has no place in the tax bill. The #GOPTaxScam would destroy a natural treasure that we have defended for decades. We must #ProtectTheArctic!
What’s clear is that this bill would raise taxes on tens of millions of middle-class households, hurt economic growth nationwide, and cut taxes for the wealthiest one percent even further.
We are still uncovering information about the last-minute additions to the Senate #taxbill, their dangerous consequences, and the hollowness of the #GOP snake oil sales pitch.
Today, #GOP will hold their first public meeting to work out differences between the 2 versions of their deficit-exploding tax scam. But it is little more than window dressing because they already announced a deal before the first meeting even took place: https://t.co/qfjdDvHe0G
#ThisIsNotaDrill. The only thing more unpopular than this #GOPTaxScam is drilling in the #ArticRefuge. 70% of Americans want to #ProtectTheArctic. https://t.co/zKps3lJaIw

@EdWorkforce This bill only continues the #GOP and Secretary #DeVos’ attack on education &amp; forces students and non-profit institutions to pay for corporate giveaways. Our students deserve better.
(1/2) Today, @EdWorkforce is considering H.R. 4508, a partisan bill that would make college more expensive for students and give for-profit corporations—like #TrumpUniversity—unprecedented access to federal student aid dollars.
Proud to join @GovCuomo and the #NY congressional delegation in calling for a much-needed federal aid package for #PuertoRico. We have an obligation to help our fellow citizens during what will be a longer-than-anticipated period of rebuilding: https://t.co/Ab2H3dpkGj

.@HouseGOP is kicking the can down the road with a short term plan that only funds the government for another 2 weeks. Why should the American people believe that the #GOP will turn their attention to national priorities when they’ve been MIA for months? https://t.co/vJl4J5gjhJ
Government #shutdowns come with very real consequences for millions of people across this country. Today I took to the floor to remind @HouseGOP of just what happened during their last self-inflicted shutdown in 2013 🔽 https://t.co/Z9C3ifmGzw
Yesterday @HouseGOP passed their first "gun control" legislation since #LasVegas &amp; #SutherlandSprings. The bill would weaken gun laws across the country and make it easier for criminals to carry concealed, loaded weapons across state lines. Disgraceful. #StopCCR
#TBT to being on the House floor for the start of the last, self-inflicted gov. shutdown by the #GOP in 2013. If the #GOP continues to prioritize their #TaxScam &amp; ignore domestic priorities, they might find themselves right back where they were less than 5 years ago. Shameful. https://t.co/wxfGfxa6Yq
New Yorkers should not have their economic futures turned upside down by a deficit-exploding, campaign donor-appeasing #GOPTaxScam. I will continue to lead the fight against this dangerous bill: https://t.co/irNB7wX0MJ

As Republicans vote to go to conference on the #GOPTaxScam, I continue to oppose this bill that raises taxes on 82 million Americans, kicks 13 million Americans off health care, &amp; adds $1.7 trillion dollars to the debt. RT if you agree. https://t.co/f7ztf3CEL7
Right now, #POTUS is removing protections from more than 2 million acres of public lands and waters. It is just another shameful giveaway to oil and gas, who will make an even bigger profit off of the destruction of our nation’s most precious landscapes. #MonumentsForAll https://t.co/GkLSaPyLY4
@SenateGOP @SenateDems (3/3) At the end of the day, this is one of the largest transfers of wealth from working families to the wealthy that we have ever seen. This is anything but responsible governance.
@SenateGOP @SenateDems (2/3) Here’s what we know: the #TaxScam repeals #ACA’s individual mandate, hurts scholarship opportunities for students hoping to attend college, and opens the floodgates for drilling in pristine natural wildlife refuges.
(1/3) @SenateGOP passed their dangerous, deficit-exploding tax scam. At the very last minute, they included illegible, handwritten additions to the bill and lobbyists got the details before many @SenateDems and the public.
The calls keep coming in from people who oppose the @FCC’s plan to do away with #netneutrality. This fight is far from over, and I will keep working to ensure your voices are being heard! https://t.co/I1PrT3NHDW

Funding for Community Health Centers, which provide more than 27 million people  with access to #healthcare, has now been expired for 2 months. It’s time for Republican leaders in Congress to step up and reauthorize this critical program: https://t.co/FQPlLAp6h9
@SenateGOP @jctgov Washington Republicans should start listening to the experts and stop pushing a #TaxScam that would only benefit their wealthy donors.
@SenateGOP @jctgov This #TaxPlan is a reckless move that would hurt hard-working families, put our nation further in debt, and harm economic growth.
@SenateGOP @jctgov More than 35 renowned economists from the University of Chicago claim this #taxscam would only add to the long-term federal debt burden.
@SenateGOP The @CBOgov and @jctgov have said that, by 2027, people making $40,000 to $50,000 would pay a combined $5.3 billion more in taxes, while those earning $1 million or more would get a $5.8 billion cut.
.@SenateGOP is rushing ahead this week with a tax plan that has been roundly criticized by several independent analyses: https://t.co/Otgy3DWn0k
(4/4) It is time for congressional Republicans to stop the delays and reauthorize this important program.
(3/4) Right now, nearly a dozen states are preparing to notify families that this critical program is running out of money for the first time since its creation two decades ago.
(2/4) Funding for #CHIP, which nine million children rely on for their healthcare and well-being, has now been expired for 60 days.
(1/4) There are 10 days left until the gov. runs out funding and will be forced to shut its doors. If that wasn't bad enough, Republicans in Congress continue to ignore major legislative priorities: https://t.co/qufuDfWx8J
(4/4) It is past time for publicly available data on how #antibiotics are being used on farms. I will not stop sounding the alarm until it happens.
(3/4) There is no reason our nation should be falling behind the curve while countries like Denmark and the Netherlands lead the way in preserving these life-saving drugs.
(2/4) 80% of antibiotics in this country are sold for use in animals with most being fed to healthy farm animals to compensate for crowded and unsanitary living conditions or to promote growth. The American people are paying the price, with an estimated 23,000 deaths each year.

#POTUS overstepped the line of succession at the #CFPB and put a member of his own cabinet in charge. The legal &amp; ethical implications are murky, but one thing is for sure: this move shows an utter lack of concern for American consumers. https://t.co/F41luwNpti
@FCC (3/3) The fight to save #netneutrality is not over, and your voices remain crucial to this debate.
@FCC (2/2) Simply put, it is just another massive giveaway from the Trump administration to large corporations that want to charge consumers more money.
(1/2) The phones have been ringing off the hook from people who share my opposition to the @FCC’s plan to abandon #netneutrality safeguards. This roll back would endanger the principles of a free and open internet and turn a deaf ear to tens of millions of consumers.
As of today, 10,008 #Dreamers have lost #DACA since #POTUS ended the program. Approx. 122 #Dreamers lose their #DACA protection every day that Congress delays acting on the #DREAMAct. Dreamers cannot afford another day of inaction. We need the #DreamActNow https://t.co/cDQUcCivTb

The FCC’s proposal turns a deaf ear to millions of consumers and instead represents yet another corporate giveaway from the Trump administration. While I am dismayed at this plan, the fight is not over to save #NetNeutrality and protect the free and open internet.
This proposed rollback would cut the legal legs out from under the principles of a free and open internet that are so vital to our economy and democracy. Repealing these safeguards will only stack the field in favor of large corporations who want to charge customers more money.
We must save #NetNeutrality. I’ve heard from hundreds of constituents in just the last 24 hours who share my opposition to the FCC’s proposal to abandon net neutrality protections. Net neutrality helps create competition and grow innovation...

While there's no bipartisan support for the GOP #taxscam bill, I think it's safe to say there is bipartisan opposition. https://t.co/qBJJ9JPSv8
@HouseGOP They're hoping no one is watching as they work to hand out giveaways to the wealthy and corporations at the expense of 36 million middle-class households.

The @Amtrak sign has been installed at the new #ROC train station! I’m counting down the days until we cut that ribbon! https://t.co/IGsMpc1BW4
In celebration, I toured one of our community’s most impressive companies, SiMPore, who has grown from a start-up to a successful business! https://t.co/DLt5vfAUg2
Happy #StartupDay! Startups are at the forefront of innovation, create jobs in our communities, and help drive our economy forward.
With his advocacy &amp; leadership in this role, the photonics industry in ROC &amp; across the country will continue to thrive for years to come!
Ed has worked side-by-side with me as we launch the photonics institute and position #ROC to lead the world in this revolutionary research
Congratulations to Ed White on being named chair of the National Photonics Initiative (NPI) Steering Committee! https://t.co/0EBQRvDoHw

I will work with anyone—Democrat or Republican—in defending hard-won health care benefits for the American people.
I recently signed onto a letter with more than 80 of my colleagues that lists bipartisan solutions to improving the #ACA.
Congress has the obligation to work together to strengthen &amp; improve this landmark law, which has helped provide coverage for so many.
Carole is right. The benefits and protections afforded by the #ACA must be protected. https://t.co/V7VGbRRJK2
I was proud to introduce some of my summer interns last week in the Rules Cmte! Learn more on how to apply here, https://t.co/VT0LyKFC69 https://t.co/GsxROI0ync
One would think that this amendment would have been adopted if their intention was to use this authority to go to conference.
That amendment was rejected, leaving House Republicans the option to fast-track passage of the Senate bill completely bypassing conference.
In light of that news, Rules Committee Democrats made a motion to limit fast-track authority to motions to go to conference.
Leader McConnell is reportedly telling Senators that the Senate bill will not become law, but will only allow them to go to conference.
Take my survey here: https://t.co/iWsNrW6qtA
I’ve said it before, but it bears repeating: your voice remains an essential part of this debate.
Every minute, news continues to break regarding Senate Republicans’ efforts to repeal the #ACA
Proud to announce a $7 million grant for @abccaa to continue their important working helping kids in our community! https://t.co/FjNSXAHqjm
Today and every day, I stand with all of our service members. Retweet if you agree. https://t.co/WF6QmQmBF5
Anyone brave enough to wear the United States' uniform &amp; risk their life is nothing less than a patriot, regardless of their gender identity
This is immoral and it makes our nation less safe.
If what #POTUS laid out in his tweets is implemented, the DoD could begin discharging transgender service members at any moment.
POTUS' ban on transgender service members undermines our military’s effectiveness &amp; is an insult to the approx. 15,000 transgender soldiers.
We owe these brave men and women nothing but the best and that’s exactly what this bipartisan bill will do.
The greater #ROC area is home to approximately 60,000 veterans.
Benefits are also restored for veterans whose school unexpectedly closes.
With this #ForeverGIBill, Purple heart beneficiaries would also become eligible, regardless of the amount of time served.
It's being called the #ForeverGIBill because it allows veterans to use their education benefit at any point in their lifetime.
It's the largest update to the #GIBill since the Post 9/11 GI Bill. I'm proud to be a cosponsor and to have voted for its passage.
Last night, the House passed H.R. 3218, the Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017, by a vote of 405-0.
Like so many of you, I am frustrated and outraged. Now, I want your thoughts. Take my survey here: https://t.co/iWsNrW6qtA https://t.co/xq62voeQv7
This is no way to consider legislation that could impact millions of families and one-sixth of our economy. It’s absolutely unprecedented.
Yet, Senate Republicans are expected to cast their votes tomorrow on a bill no one has even seen yet.
One minute it’s ‘repeal and replace’ and the next it’s ‘repeal it now and replace it later.’
What seems like every hour, news breaks about the Republican #healthcare repeal bill.
Proud to announce new funding for the firefighters of the Hilton-Parma Fire District! More here: https://t.co/cmkDRZNxDI

This week is no different. @HouseGOP reported out their dangerous government  funding bills for consideration on the House Floor. https://t.co/yorB6IPm5D
Already in 2017, #POTUS and the Republican-led Congress have launched an unprecedented attack on women's health and #reprorights.
What seems like every day, women are waking up to news that their rights &amp; access to comprehensive care are being eliminated #ProtectOurCare

@HouseAppropsGOP We refuse to give back the laws our mothers won and we will not stop working to #ProtectOurCare.
@HouseAppropsGOP The women of America are watching &amp; we will not sit silently as Republicans in Washington take dangerous steps to dismantle hard-won rights
@HouseAppropsGOP Today's #approps bill will take the GOP's anti-woman agenda to new heights by including riders that go beyond anything we’ve ever seen.
@HouseAppropsGOP This includes reducing access to affordable contraception, undermining #TitleX, expanding the dangerous #GlobalGagRule, and much, much more.
@HouseAppropsGOP Already in 2017, #POTUS and the Republican-led Congress have launched an unprecedented attack on women's health and #reprorights.

I’ve always said that listening to the people I serve is the most important part of my job. That’s especially true today.
The Republican health care repeal bill is on life support, but that doesn’t mean our fight is over.
@hickeyfreeman (4/4) Because we all know that American manufacturing should be more than a political talking point.
@hickeyfreeman (3/4) Year after year, I am proud to stand with local businesses like Hickey Freeman in protecting good-paying jobs in our region.
(2/4) If #POTUS is serious about rebuilding American manufacturing he should start looking at examples like #ROC’s @HickeyFreeman.
(1/4) Yesterday, #POTUS launched #MadeInAmericaWeek and released his #NAFTA renegotiation objectives.
@ROCPride2017 Thank you, @ROCPride2017 for hosting another tremendous parade in support of full equality. I can’t wait for next year!

(7/7) It’s even more shameful that Republicans are moving quickly and quietly to help make it a reality.
(6/7) It is shameful that #POTUS has turned this wall from a dangerous political talking point into proposed policy.
(5/7) It could clear the way for DoD to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on the #borderwall w/out even an 🔼or 🔽vote on the House floor.
(4/7) This move takes Republican leadership’s complete disregard for standard Congressional procedure to a whole new level.
(3/7) The bipartisan language they removed had been debated, amended, and accepted by the Armed Services Committee by a voice vote.
(2/7) ..would pay for #POTUS’ wasteful and absurd border wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.
(1/7) Last night at Rules Cmte., Republicans voted to eliminate a provision from the #NDAA that ensured no funding authorized in the bill..
I’ve long supported an open net, which is the foundation of free speech. We cannot let #POTUS’ @FCC get rid of #NetNeutrality.
Without #NetNeutrality, big companies could have an unfair advantage over small businesses online.
#NetNeutrality means consumers—not big corporations—choose what websites and applications we see online.
Don’t believe the spin—taking away strong #NetNeutrality rules won’t put consumers first.

I'm committed to ensuring that all entrepreneurs have the tools they need to start a company, create good-paying jobs, &amp; bolster our economy
These businesses are a part of the foundation of our country.
Including everything from the food service industry to agriculture, manufacturing, arts and entertainment, and construction
These businesses encompass every corner of our working economy.
Currently, there are more than 3.2 million immigrant-owned businesses in the United States: https://t.co/ViHAXJpFcW
Not only do they start businesses, they create new jobs for American workers and invest in their communities.
Immigrants help drive America’s growth and prosperity.

@SenateGOP .@SenateGOP’s #Trumpcare looks a lot like the House version:	-Slashes Medicaid 	-Higher costs	-Lower coverage	-Protections gutted

I was proud to #holdthefloor 1 year ago today &amp; I will continue trying to finally end the #gunviolence epidemic that is plaguing our country
Whether it’s an elementary school, a college, a hospital, a place of worship, or any place in the world, #gunviolence is there among us.
On average, 93 people a day are killed by a gun in America. Acts of violence have become all too common in communities across our country.
Just last week we were all shocked by the senseless attack at the GOP baseball practice.
In the years since, we said the same after the violence at #Pulse, in Aurora, Dallas, South Carolina and other communities.
After #SandyHook we said “never again.”
#TBT to one year ago when I held the floor w/my colleagues in support of commonsense legislation to combat gun violence. #NoBillNoBreak https://t.co/VCtK1Jordw
@ngadc The arts are invaluable and I will do everything in my power to continue to defend them.
@ngadc I am not known for remaining quiet on this issue and I refuse to sit silently now.
@ngadc Despite that fact, the arts are being attacked under the current administration—w/major slashes to federal arts funding in the #TrumpBudget.
@ngadc The arts are our universal language and help bring all communities—from students to veterans—together.
@ngadc I’m proud to have led my colleagues in requesting full funding for the @ngadc this year.
Today I had the chance to meet Rusty Powell, director of @ngadc, to discuss the effect the arts have on so many across our country. https://t.co/bbv6cdxASR

Securing the funding for the new #ROC train station is a part of my larger infrastructure agenda.
Since we all know that good jobs &amp; new companies come to communities that invest in local infrastructure.
Reliable transportation like the new #ROC station are so important for growing our regional economy.
The new train station will be a major improvement for travelers like Lyndsi, who use the trains when visiting #ROC: https://t.co/Dn9MZIUKUy
I’m counting down the days until we cut that ribbon!
More parking spaces, more seating, and less regional delays are all soon to come with the new station.
This 12,000 square foot, state-of-the-art facility  will play a major role in growing our economy and bringing new businesses &amp; jobs to #ROC
I worked tirelessly to secure funding for the new #ROC train station and I’m so excited that soon it will open its doors to all of you.

I'm glad to see this decision has apparently been reversed. I would strongly object to implementing such a thing in the House.
I've spoken to reporters in hallways for years. Maybe Republicans are trying to hide now because their ideas are so indefensible.
This is the United States of America. Reporters have a right and responsibility to question public officials.
..and reconnecting neighborhoods in downtown #ROC by filling in the Inner Loop.
This includes dredging our harbors, fixing our highways and bridges, improving our airport, building a new train station..
That’s why I’ve continued working for years to improve our region’s transportation infrastructure
Infrastructure projects like these are felt across our entire region, driving job creation &amp; construction projects throughout Monroe County
I fight to secure the funding to dredge our port in order to maximize its potential since it imports $10M worth of goods annually.

@HouseGOP @SEC_News @SDNYnews @CongressEthics We must uphold the trust of the people and that’s exactly why I’m holding my colleagues accountable.
@HouseGOP I just called on the @SEC_News, @SDNYnews, House Committee on Ethics, and @CongressEthics to investigate this major stock trading scandal.
@HouseGOP Rep. Collins is the largest shareholder of this small Australian biotech company.
@HouseGOP At least eight current and former Republican members, in addition to spouses, children, and staff have now invested in Innate.
@HouseGOP Also troubling, the report indicates Rep. Collins was in the Capitol building when having some of these conversations.
@HouseGOP The report documents Collins offering a “stock tip” &amp; suggesting colleagues “get in early” and invest.
A new report strengthens allegations that Rep. Collins &amp; a growing number of @HouseGOP abused taxpayer-funded positions for personal profit.
Explosive new report from @thehill spells out major stock trading scandal among House Republicans: https://t.co/1GYN3eg41f

@HouseGOP Wall Street’s games led to 11M losing their homes in the financial crisis. #WrongChoiceAct would bring us back to those days.
@HouseGOP #WrongChoiceAct is another sign of @HouseGOP’s commitment to helping Wall Street at the expense of hardworking families.
Tonight, the Rules Cmte. will consider #WrongChoiceAct, @HouseGOP's bill that would dismantle financial reform &amp; put the economy at risk.
It's a testament to the work being done in our community that Lumisyn is one of just 13 small businesses nationwide to receive this funding.

With this new legislation, international trade will finally benefit American workers, businesses, and manufacturers.
This new legislation I’m introducing will transform how our nation approaches international trade: https://t.co/KAoAyyaDkW

Our nation has engaged in decades of misguided trade deals that have been anything but fair to workers and manufacturers.

It's past time @HouseGOP give the American people the honest and transparent government they expect and deserve.
It’s clear something has to be done, and it begins with passing my bill, the End Congressional Stock Market Abuse Act.
It's been one scandal after another for members of the majority—from Tom Price, to Chris Collins, to the Rep. mentioned in this new report.
Members of Congress should recuse themselves from voting on legislation that impacts their own financial interest.
This investigation raises concerns that dozens of Republicans voted for the #ACA repeal bill while having a financial stake in the outcome.

The #TrumpBudget is as heartless as it is harmful. My statement here ⬇ https://t.co/KikCmv7eNN
My heart broke watching reports out of the #ManchesterArena last night. Keep everyone affected by this tragedy in your thoughts.
I’ve said it so much I sound like a broken record—the public deserves a transparent gov, not one that hides the truth at every possible turn
I strongly support the Office of Government Ethics’ decision to demand copies of the waivers provided by the Trump Administration.
W/out access to these waivers, the American public has no idea which special interests are working behind closed doors to influence #POTUS
This is a dramatic departure from the norm, since the prior administration automatically made all ethics waivers public.
New reports indicate admin blocked efforts to disclose the names of former lobbyists granted waivers to work in White House &amp; fed agencies
It’s another day in Washington and the Trump Administration is once again working to keep the public in the dark.
@RepWalterJones Workers dedicate their careers to serving companies &amp; my legislation will help ensure they get the pensions and health benefits they deserve
@RepWalterJones Benefits that were once guaranteed have been increasingly eroded as companies use corporate restructurings to avoid paying retirees.
That’s why I’m proud to stand with my Republican colleague, @RepWalterJones, in introducing the Employee Benefits Protection Act of 2017.
Retirees should not be forced to live in fear that the benefits promised to them in exchange for decades of work could be ripped away.
Thank you, @UofR, @RITNEWS, @NazarethCollege, @Brockport, @MonroeCC &amp; @FisherNews for your continued support on this important issue!
W/no additional funding from the federal gov, Perkins loans help students attain an education &amp; allow them to break the cycle of poverty.

I’ve always fought for affordable education and my new bill, the Perkins Loans Extension Act of 2017, is no different.

If we are ever going to get the truth we need an independent commission. Now.
The news surrounding the former FBI director is just the latest sign that we cannot trust President Trump.
… in what I believe is a gross abuse of power meant to prevent them from doing their jobs and getting to the truth.
That’s not all they have in common. Each was reportedly investigating this administration’s actions before being fired by the president…
#JamesComey? Fired by President Trump. Sally Yates? Fired by President Trump. Preet Bharara? Fired by President Trump.
The American people have heard and seen enough. It is beyond time for answers.
We need an independent, 9/11 style investigation to look into Russia's meddling in our elections &amp; Putin's hold over this administration.

RT if you agree that it’s time for @HouseGOP to abandon #TrumpCare &amp; work with @HouseDemocrats to improve the #ACA https://t.co/1ZNS4veUuv
#TrumpCare would kick 14 million Americans off of Medicaid – harming children, seniors &amp; people with disabilities. https://t.co/N87C40LYLf

I'm calling on #POTUS to honor his promises to the  #LGBTQ community. @POTUS: don’t issue a #LicenseToDiscriminate
Last call! High school artists from #ROC have 2 more days to submit their artowrk to the #CAC2017. More here: https://t.co/VT0LyKFC69
Our #LGBTQ community is long overdue for full protection under the law &amp; that’s why I will fight today &amp; every day for the #EqualityAct
The bill would amend the Civil Rights Act to include nondiscrimination protections on the basis of sex, sexual orientation &amp; gender identity
That’s why I’m proud to stand with #LGBTQ Americans in co-sponsoring the #EqualityAct. Now is the time for #EqualityforAll
No one should be fired, evicted, or kicked out of a restaurant or hotel simply for being who they are. #EqualityforAll
Mr. President, the women of America are watching. We will not give back the #reprorights our mothers won. #Resist
It’s been just over #100days since the historic #MarchOnWashington and POTUS has done nothing but attack hard-won women’s health rights.
I'm proud today to join more than 140 of my colleagues in condemning POTUS’ unrelenting #100day attack on women &amp; families. https://t.co/u8AKUbOpHq
Tomorrow marks #Trump100Days. Here’s a look at how troubling it’s been: https://t.co/EztFFvYCIB
.@HouseGOP @PPFA The women of America have had enough.
.@HouseGOP @PPFA .@HouseGOP must open their eyes to the fact that their fellow Members of Congress and the American public oppose these extremist efforts.
.@HouseGOP @PPFA Now, they risk the same result over more restrictions on women's health.
.@HouseGOP The @HouseGOP recklessly forced a showdown in 2013 when they shut down the government over a scheme to defund @PPFA.
.@HouseGOP Once again, we may be faced with a power play in Congress pitting the federal budget against women's control over their own bodies.
I'm outraged by recent @HouseGOP efforts to attach anti-choice riders on their bill to fund the government.
.@HouseGOP the rest of America, but not quite good enough for them.
.@HouseGOP By protecting themselves from their latest proposal, the Republicans who wrote the bill are saying #TrumpCare is good enough for..
.@HouseGOP .. exempts Members of Congress and their staff from the worst impacts of their harmful proposal. #Trumpcare
The hypocrisy keeps growing. @HouseGOP's newest backroom deal would slip a provision into their disastrous health care repeal bill that..
The @HouseGOP has not allowed a single open rule this Congress or last Congress. Why is @SpeakerRyan afraid of a debate?
We haven’t had a single open rule under @SpeakerRyan. This lack of transparency prevents the public from getting the debates they deserve.
#Trump100days produced nothing but disasters, backroom deals, and an unprecedented closed process – and that’s how Republicans describe it!
Under @SpeakerRyan, we’ve hit a record-setting pace of closed rules, w/ @HouseGOP on their way to breaking the all-time high. https://t.co/Kf5rEB1THl
Republican leadership in Washington has been a disaster. But don’t take my word for it. Here’s what Republicans are saying: https://t.co/EFaBD6EhpJ
.@HouseGOP's failed #ACA repeal, rollback of privacy protections &amp; a record-breaking pace of closed rules = historically ↓ approval ratings.
We’re nearing #Trump100Days &amp; here’s what @POTUS &amp; @HouseGOP have to show for it. https://t.co/cOAsNuXTsO
#HandsOffMyBC because we deserve to have the freedom to live and plan our lives with dignity.

.@UNFPA Eliminating this funding would be a disaster and I will continue to do all I can to see it restored. #FundUNFPA
.@UNFPA Beyond the life-saving impact of this program, UNFPA also helps ensure that the US remains a global leader in humanitarian assistance.
.@UNFPA I’ve been a proud supporter of @UNFPA’s work for years, including advocating for its increased funding. #FundUNFPA
.@UNFPA The @UNFPA also delivers life-saving services to women and girls in war zones and refugee camps.
.@UNFPA supports a range of critical programs in more than 150 countries. #FundUNFPA
I'm proud to stand with my colleagues in urging Sec. Tillerson to reverse @POTUS' decision to eliminate funding for @UNFPA. #FundUNFPA
.@HouseGOP .@HouseGOP should stop this dangerous proposal and finally come to the table ready to improve the #ACA!
.@HouseGOP ..of not being able to obtain health care coverage because of a pre-existing condition.
.@HouseGOP We must not allow @HouseGOP leaders to take our country back to the days when millions were forced to live in fear....
.@HouseGOP It's hard to imagine what @HouseGOP would need to do to make a bill w/ a 17% approval rating even less popular, but this would do the trick.
.@HouseGOP ..including a deal that would undermine coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.
.@HouseGOP According to reports, they are now discussing changes to this bill that would make it even more disastrous...
.@HouseGOP leaders are desperately trying to revive their failed health care repeal bill.
His removal from the NSC is a positive development, but it does not go far enough. He shouldn’t be anywhere near the White House.
Elevating him to a position that is usually reserved for military generals and experienced security professionals was outrageous.
..that promote anti-Semitism, xenophobia, and racism.
Bannon has disturbing ties to the White Nationalist Movement and a history of repeatedly and aggressively pushing stories...
Like so many of you, I was outraged when POTUS signed an executive order giving his Chief Strategist, Steve Bannon, a seat on the #NSC
Happy #EqualPayDay! When a woman is paid less it cheats her entire family &amp; that’s why I'll continue to fight for equal pay for equal work.
We cannot let politics prevent an investigation from uncovering the facts, and I hope Acting U.S. Attorney Kim continues any investigation.
..an investigation before it damaged the Trump Administration.
It is time for AG Sessions to address the very serious evidence that Mr. Bharara’s firing was a politically motivated attempt to stop...
..into the secretary’s questionable stock trades only adds to this controversy.
The abrupt firing of former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara while he was reportedly conducting an investigation...
The questions surrounding Secretary Price have only grown since he joined the Trump cabinet.
Here’s how the @HouseGOP wasted your time &amp; taxpayer money this week: https://t.co/291xNmKSBk
Enjoyed reading today’s @DandC! I'll always be a proud advocate for arts programs across the country &amp; in #ROC! https://t.co/bTSbhgGV5z
I’m proud to #StandWithPP, which services 2.5 million people—men &amp; women—each year. Thanks, @PPFA for all that you do!
..the very real issues facing our country, @HouseGOP is working to eliminate privacy protections for the American people.
Now more than ever, our personal data is vulnerable and it is deeply troubling that instead of addressing…
I would never support this kind of giveaway to internet service providers at the expense of your privacy.
.@HouseGOP are moving quickly and quietly under the CRA in the hopes the American people won’t notice.
Every single American who uses the internet would be impacted.
.. collected through your internet use &amp; sell it without your consent.
This would allow internet service providers to access your private browsing history including SSN, personal finances &amp; health data...
Today, @HouseGOP will use the #CRA to roll back an @FCC safeguard designed to keep your internet browsing history private.
Today's @nytimes article highlights what I've been saying for years: we must protect federally-funded arts programs. https://t.co/b20nPW2UUd
This bill deserves not only to be pulled from the floor today - it should be scrapped once and for all.
A bad process begets a bad product – and both this process, and this product could not have been worse.
by bringing this bill to the floor just hours after releasing the final text late last night.
.@HouseGOP tried to jam this bill through the House without holding a single hearing, w/out waiting for a nonpartisan @USCBO analysis, and..
All the while, it would steal from Medicare, shorten the life of the Medicare Trust Fund &amp; ransack the funds that seniors depend on for care
emergency services, maternity care, and prescription drugs.
This legislation would've also killed the requirement for insurance companies to offer Essential Health Benefits, including...
and those aged 50 to 64 would have faced a crushing age tax, paying five times more for premiums.
24 million people would have been pushed off their health insurance, families would have had to pay higher premiums and deductibles..
This decision is a win for the American people, who would have been devastated by this bill.
It turns out that the president who wrote the book on deal making couldn’t close this deal.
The vote on #AHCA shouldn’t just be delayed, it should be scrapped indefinitely. The bill is a disaster.
RT @RepSpeier: .@AliceOllstein @SenPatRoberts I don't want to lose my prostate cancer screenings either. #AHCA #Trumpcare
I'm outraged by @HouseGOP's decision to decimate &amp; replace the #ACA w/ a far-worse, half-baked option &amp; will continue to voice my opposition
Instead of working to strengthen this landmark law, @HouseGOP could bring their repeal bill to the floor for a vote as early as today.
in providing high-quality, affordable coverage to more than 20 million people nationwide.
I was proud to bring the #ACA to the floor in 2009 as Chairwoman of the Rules Committee &amp; have been impressed by the strides we have made..
Today marks the 7th anniversary of the signing of the #ACA.
The Republican bill cuts care for families to give out a tax cut to the wealthy, which is why I’m fighting against it.
This bill is scheduled to be voted on tomorrow. I hope the speaker reads what you have to say before this vote.
Today I delivered those stories to @SpeakerRyan so he could hear directly from you what’s at stake with #TrumpCare.
The past several months, I’ve asked #ROC families to submit stories about how the #ACA has helped them.
I will continue to advance this bill, so that the American public can rest assured knowing #SCOTUS is held to the highest ethical standards.
My bill, the Supreme Court Ethics Act, would require justices adopt the same code of conduct required by every other fed. Judge in the USA.
For years SCOTUS justices have undermined public confidence—attending political events &amp; failing to disclose potential conflicts of interest
I wrote to the @senjudiciary &amp; asked that they question #Gorsuch on requiring #SCOTUS to adopt a binding code of ethics for justices.
As a Member of the House I don’t vote on #SCOTUS nominees, but I strongly believe #Gorsuch is the wrong choice.
If Rep. Collins thinks that’s a good deal, he’s not a very good businessman or representative for our state.
With this amendment, they would be sending our state a $4.7 billion bill.
Either way, the @HouseGOP is proposing New Yorkers pay for their terrible plan.
if Republicans steal billions from NY to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy it doesn’t matter if taxpayers have to cover the cost.
Shifting the local cost share to the state is a political sleight of hand..
The overall Medicaid plan would cost New Yorkers billions of dollars of lost federal funds and jeopardize hospital stability.
.. devastate our state, especially upstate rural areas.
It's a gimmick, &amp; nothing more than pure political cover for wavering NY Republicans that know the @HouseGOP healthcare plan would...
I strongly oppose the backroom deal announced late last night by Chris Collins that was added to the @HouseGOP health care repeal bill.
POTUS’ elimination of #GLRI is outrageous &amp; I'll continue to fight to ensure that his budget proposal does not become a reality.
26 million in our region depend on the #GreatLakes for commerce, transportation &amp; recreation each year.
As Co-Chair of the bipartisan Great Lakes Task Force, defending our lakes has been one of my top priorities.
POTUS’ dangerous budget proposal would eliminate #GLRI, which fights invasive species, reduces pollution &amp; protects our lakes.
We must break the stranglehold the pharmaceutical industry &amp; corporate agriculture have on our public health policy &amp; finally pass this bill
It's beyond time for meaningful action to protect the public health &amp; stop this in its tracks.
All the while, the consequences have continued to grow, with the discovery last year of an antibiotic-resistant superbug in the US
Although I have been sounding the alarm for years, many leaders have failed to take this threat seriously.
This is 40th year since @US_FDA acknowledged the threat of antibiotic-resistance &amp; called for reduction in the use of antibiotics in animals
PAMTA would prevent a nightmarish post-antibiotic future &amp; preserve the use of antibiotics for sick humans &amp; animals https://t.co/sejrg9nSMT
As the only microbiologist in Congress, I'm so proud today to introduce the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act (PAMTA).
Proud to receive a perfect rating from @Defenders &amp; @LCVoters—I have, &amp; will always be, a proud advocate for our environment. https://t.co/F7KNU1QDOx
For a full report of the disastrous impacts an #ACA repeal would have on #ROC, please visit my site: https://t.co/8pEFEkZcWZ
Under @HouseGOP's health care plan, employer-based coverage would be eroded &amp; 177 million would lose their protections. Shameful.
We should be improving the #ACA instead of rushing this bill through just to try and fulfill a political talking point.
.. that the @HouseGOP repeal bill would give a tax break to the wealthy and leave families struggling to afford coverage.
.@USCBO confirmed what many experts and those in the industry have said from the beginning...
Although the Republicans are claiming otherwise, the Congressional Budget Office is non-partisan, objective, and unbiased.
That number doesn’t even reflect the millions more would be left with worse coverage and fewer benefits at a higher cost.
This analysis has found that the @HouseGOP plan would cause 24 million people to lose their health insurance over the next ten years alone.
.@USCBO analysis makes clear why Republicans were skipping the hearing process and rushing this bill through.
I hope @HouseGOP follows through w/ @WhiteHouse's promise of an open rule for #TrumpCare!
There hasn’t been an open rule under @SpeakerRyan's leadership, w/ @HouseGOP already on pace to break the all-time record for closed rules.
That’s why it's even more important that all Members are able to offer amendments on the floor though an open rule
We haven’t even received a budget score from @USCBO making clear how much the plan would cost &amp; how it would impact our insurance markets
The @HouseGOP is pushing this bill through, skipping the hearing process &amp; failing to hear from experts, doctors, &amp; those battling illnesses
I welcome Congressman Jim Jordan’s request for an open rule on the @HouseGOP’s health care repeal bill.
.@USCBO How will #TrumpCare affect the growth rate of health care prices? #NoScoreNoVote
.@USCBO #TrumpCare defunds @PPFA. How will this affect women’s access to family planning? #NoScoreNoVote
.@USCBO How many fewer people will receive treatment for mental health under #TrumpCare? #noscorenovote
.@USCBO How much do you expect deductibles to increase under #TrumpCare? #noscorenovote
.@HouseGOP is rushing #TrumpCare through without a @USCBO cost estimate, a dangerous move that leaves many questions unanswered.

.@HouseGOP's efforts will turn back the clock, undermine GINA &amp; make it easy for employers to access employee’s personal information.
GINA allows people to take advantage of the potential of genetic research w/out worrying  this info will cost them their job &amp; health care.
None of us were born with perfect genes, it affects us all.
I fought for 14 years to pass GINA so Americans no longer had to fear their genetic info would be used against them. https://t.co/J8oP9ZopB7

This is an immoral attempt to fulfill a campaign talking point, not about keeping our country safe.
No immigrant from any of the countries included in this ban has ever killed an American in a U.S. terrorist attack.
This order still bans travel from several Muslim nations, suspends our refugee program, &amp; makes our country less safe.
POTUS just signed his latest executive order, a dangerous attempt to get his de facto Muslim ban through the courts.

Whether it's the scandals surrounding the #AG or former Security Advisor Flynn or the fact POTUS still refuses to release his taxes..
Simply recusing himself from a possible investigation into this administration’s troubling ties to Russia is not enough.
AG #Sessions lied under oath during his confirmation hearing. He lacks credibility &amp; the public's trust. He must resign immediately.

I am dismayed by the @HouseGOP’s refusal to look into this, but I will keep pushing to get the American people the answers they deserve.
I believe a bipartisan, 9/11-style commission must be formed to investigate Russia’s influence on the Trump Admin. and the 2016 election.
Recent reports that the president’s top adviser directed FBI agents to rebut news reports about Trump allies’ ties to Russia is outrageous.
The constant drip, drip, drip of information regarding POTUS' ties to Russia remains deeply concerning.
Republicans failed to rise to the occasion &amp; enabled President Trump's unprecedented secrecy by voting down this resolution. It is shameful.
No president in modern times has refused to show his tax returns to the American people.
Last night’s vote on H Res 111 that I cosponsored was the House's first chance to go on record in support of POTUS releasing his tax returns
#rocstation will reduce regional delays &amp; help move goods &amp; people more efficiently. I look forward to cutting the ribbon later this year!

The @POTUS should nominate someone to lead the Labor Department who actually believes in supporting our workforce.
Like the majority of @POTUS's other nominees, Puzder’s record raised doubts about his ability to address the issues facing average Americans
From the moment he was first nominated, it was glaringly obvious that #Puzder was not the right person to lead the Department of Labor.
Last night at the Rules Committee, I voiced my opposition to the @HouseGOP's plans to attack #TitleX, the national family planning program: https://t.co/A9PYzK9YVO
Enough. It's now past time the @HouseGOP end their ruthless assault on women's health care &amp; focus on the real issues facing our country.
Women across the country are fed up with @HouseGOP's attack on access to contraception and basic repro health services. #ProtectOurCare
This attack includes limiting millions of women's access to vital care, contraception, &amp; family planning services. #ProtectOurCare
Now, the @HouseGOP has proven they'll stop at nothing by using the #CRA to attack #TitleX, the national family planning program.
At the same time, the @POTUS demanded a #SCOTUS nominee litmus test, requiring that his nominee promise to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Next the @HouseGOP advanced HR 7, effectively banning private insurance companies from providing comprehensive reproductive health services.
First, @HouseGOP threatened women's care by attempts to dismantle #ACA with nothing to take its place.
Despite promises to focus on jobs &amp; economy, @HouseGOP started 115th Congress w/ a total assault on women's access to care #TitleX
My statement on General #Flynn's resignation: https://t.co/snUABru1AI
General Flynn’s conduct – a clear violation of the law – is as outrageous as it is inexcusable &amp; he should be fired immediately. #FlynnLied
I have serious concerns that sanctions weren’t the only inappropriate thing General #Flynn has discussed with the Russian ambassador.
His relationship with Putin has compromised his ability to represent American interests.
At best, #Flynn lacks the judgement necessary to serve as National Security Advisor.
General #Flynn should never have been appointed National Security Advisor in the first place.
I've co-sponsored HR 804, a bill that would prevent people like Bannon, who have primarily political roles, from being assigned to the #NSC.
The #NSC should be comprised of national security professionals, and we cannot let partisan politics interfere with its important work.
Steve Bannon has a history of spreading racism, xenophobia, and white nationalism. He doesn't belong anywhere near the #NSC.
Despite his promise to protect American workers, @POTUS continues to fill his cabinet with billionaires, big business leaders, &amp; CEOs. https://t.co/eXwREukbda

As a member of the House of Representatives, I don't vote on cabinet nominations but I feel strongly that the Senate should #StopSessions!
Sessions #LGBT record is also horrific. The next AG shouldn’t be someone who has voted against hate crime protections. #StopSessions
Sessions has consistently opposed women's reproductive rights &amp; voted 3 times against a law I authored, the Violence Against Women Act.
This morning the Senate Judiciary Committee will vote on AG nominee Jeff Sessions, whose voting history suggests he is not up for the job.
It is very reminiscent of President Nixon’s Saturday Night Massacre. This is another troubling day for our country.
The president’s decision to fire Acting AG Sally Yates is a blatant politicization of the agency charged with upholding our constitution.
This is not who we are. I will continue using all possible means to prevent the executive order on immigration from being implemented!
This order is unconstitutional, immoral, &amp; makes the USA less safe. Our compassion for those who are suffering is a source of our strength.
The bill also states that no federal funding or fees will be used to implement @POTUS’s offensive order.
This bill states that @POTUS’s executive order prohibiting Muslims from entering the USA will have no effect or force of law.
Today, I will stand with @HouseDemocrats in filing the Statute of Liberty Values Act to tackle Trump's troubling exec. order on immigration.

RT if you oppose GOP vote to repeal the #ACA without a replacement!
GOP is voting to add $9.5 trillion to the national debt according to OMB https://t.co/GSwMrs57TF
House GOP is voting to repeal #ACA without a replacement and take health care away from millions of American families.
I hope the American people are watching what's happening here today. Instead of solving problems, the @HouseGOP is creating new ones.
With this proposal, the @HouseGOP is effectively ripping the rug out from under millions of Americans who count on the #ACA
Took to the House floor to discuss @HouseGOP’s troubling budget, which will put the wheels in motion to repeal the #ACA
At our third Rules Committee meeting this week to discuss S. Con. Res. 3, the Republicans' troubling budget proposal. #MakeAmericaSickAgain
At 1 PM ET, I will be joining with constituents and healthcare providers to highlight the importance of the #ACA! #ProtectOurCare
If you're as outraged as I am by efforts to repeal the #ACA, join me for an event this Sunday in #ROC to #ProtectOurCare! https://t.co/Pq2HnblJi1
40% of homeless youth are #LGBT, but Ben Carson thinks they don’t deserve legal protections. He’s #BadforHUD. Senate MUST reject.
1 in 3 #trans people experience homelessness. Ben Carson believes trans people are “height of absurdity.” He’s #BadforLGBT and #BadforHUD
The Republican budget would add $9.5 trillion to the debt over ten years. That is all.
Sen #Sessions #LGBT record is horrific, AGs should promote justice &amp; equality for all. #stopsessions
Sessions won’t say if he would hire special prosecutor if Trump family violates federal insider trading laws. #stopsessions https://t.co/9wYmOwhuZU
AG supposed to protect rights of ALL Americans. Sen #Sessions voted against LGBT rights. He’s #BadforLGBT, and Senate must #StopSessions!

Will women get a fair shake from AG Jeff Sessions? His confused defense of @realDonaldTrump's sexual assault says no https://t.co/Cl9H2OblJw
As an original author of the Violence Against Women Act, I’m especially concerned Sessions voted to oppose it three times. #StopSessions
Sessions is a dangerous AG candidate, threatening the Constitutional rights and protections for women + minorities. #StopSessions
How can Sessions protect the rights of women when he doesn't support the right to choose? #StopSessions

Heading to a press conference to talk about protecting women's healthcare under @realDonaldTrump &amp; Republican Congress. #ProtectOurCare
