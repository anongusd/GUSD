Borrowing a line from @SenAlexander, DeVos says "we need to recognize that the federal government‚Äôs appropriate role is not to be the nation‚Äôs school board." #BushObamaSchoolReform
DeVos: When we try the same thing over and over again, yet expect different results, that‚Äôs not reform ‚Äì that‚Äôs insanity. #BushObamaSchoolReform
DeVos says both Bush and Obama education reforms resulted in a "further damaged classroom dynamic between teacher and student, as the focus shifted from comprehension to test-passing." #BushObamaSchoolReform
.@BetsyDeVosED: both the Bush and Obama administrations "had the same Washington 'experts' telling educators how to behave" and students aren't better for it #BushObamaSchoolReform
Common Core mention, obvi. DeVos says, "I agree ‚Äì and have always agreed ‚Äì with President Trump on this: 'Common Core is a disaster.' And at the U.S. Department of Education, Common Core is dead." #BushObamaSchoolReform
DeVos speaking at @AEIeducation. She previously served on AEI‚Äôs board and her family foundation has donated to the think tank‚Äôs general fund https://t.co/w4b37rfsBt
DeVos: The bottom line is simple: federal education reform efforts have not worked as hoped.	 	That‚Äôs not a point I make lightly or joyfully. #BushObamaSchoolReform

The bill would maintain a $250 deduction for teachers who spend their own money on classroom supplies. The House wanted to scrap that and the Senate wanted to double it.
The bill would expand 529s to cover K-12 expenses at public, private and religious schools. It would cover expenses up to $10,000 per year, including those incurred by homeschooling.
