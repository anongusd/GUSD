3/3: But if the person with HIV is taking their HIV medicine as prescribed and gets and keeps an undetectable viral load, there is effectively no risk of transmitting HIV through sex, including kissing.
2/3: In extremely rare cases, HIV has been transmitted by deep, open-mouth kissing if both partners have sores or bleeding gums and blood from the HIV-positive partner gets into the bloodstream of the HIV-negative partner.
1/3: There is little to no risk of getting HIV from any type of kissing.
