Lightfoot continued: And President Preckwinkle, along with a host of other people, did a yeoman‚Äôs job to make sure that we were providing affordable, good health care for people in this county who are most in need.
What do you admire about each other?		Lightfoot: When the Affordable Care Act was implemented, it was incredibly important that we made sure that the county health system was fully on board in implementing it, so that people most in need of those services got access to them (con)

RT @allenlinton2: On homelessness:		Preckwinkle: Raise taxes and invest corporate dollars and federal/state grants		Lightfoot: Progressive‚Ä¶
Lightfoot: "We can actually solve this problem ourselves. In our housing plan, we propose a progressive tax on the real estate transfer tax that would give relief to homeowners whose homes are less than $500,000 but tax more homes of higher assessed value."
How will you address city's homeless issue?		Preckwinkle: Enact what's been proposed by @ChiHomeless: an extra real estate tax "on properties of more than $1M so that we have a fund dedicated to supporting the homeless. We have to kick in more of our city resources into housing."
Lightfoot: "People are sick and tired of being nickel-and-dimed . . . we need to think about the ways we could be better fiscal stewards. That starts, frankly, with making sure that we're not essentially collecting tax dollars, putting them in a pile and lighting them on fire."
Lightfoot on taxes: "I'm not going to promise that I won't raise a tax, and then turn my back on that promise and raise a tax, as President Preckwinkle has done . . . we need to make sure that we are running government efficiently."
Preckwinkle: ...it not only provides us advice on how we can use our own resources internally to support the business community, but it‚Äôs also given us advice on how we should conduct ourselves in the larger arena.

Lightfoot asked about Preckwinkle's campaign attacking her with the "insider" label:		"I think it‚Äôs interesting and frankly disappointing that Toni Preckwinkle and her people would criticize me for being successful . . . I am a black success story."
How do you respond to critiques that you are a political insider?		Preckwinkle on progressive record: "I got elected to alderman on my third try. I beat the machine . . . I sponsored and supported strongly every affordable housing and living wage ordinance that came (before me)."
