@jonfavs @AOC Here is what the green new deal (which FDR would never support if he were living today) will cost according to economist, more than the entire WORLDS GDP.
@AOC AOC is the very definition of a bigot, intolerant of all viewpoints but her own.
@AOC Yet Christians get bashed and demonized by your party DAILY and you say NOTHING. Christianphobe !
@AOC Aw look the manatee thinks employing minorities and supporting them is "tokenism"...but only when Republicans do it she hasnt said a word about Old Bernie who paraded around his black campaign worker... 		"You're all racist sexist bigots!!! Now vote for us!!!" -democrats 2019
President Trump....GO TO BED!!!
I'm American I dont have to understand anything....
You're afraid of needles? That is insane you're a goth... lol
American intervention/regime change in the middle east has understandably pushed Americans away from taking that Avenue, but we cannot let it stop us from doing what's right to save lives, Maduro is a tyrant, who must be deal with swiftly. #SocialismKills https://t.co/ZSJAFJZ7Ys
@AOC  Spoken like a true socialist authoritarian dictator...Mao, Stalin and Castro would be so proud.... BTW you were elected to represent NOT rule. You'll be unseated soon dont worry. https://t.co/c64JhZDXrY
@AOC To support or encourage illegal immigration is immoral and evil, it is to support a system of exploitation, evading taxes, and labor laws. In addition it causes migrants to make a dangerous and deadly journey. Supporting illegal immigration KILLS.
Corporations should NOT be allowed to dictate what is free speech in this country!!!
@realDonaldTrump Good
China is beyond the shadow of a doubt our number one geopolitical threat, and in every sense. They are waging a aggressive campaign to usurp our place as the world's largest economy and superpower. Russia is just an inferior adversary playing catchup
Ignorance is the nature of youth
Amy Klobuchar and Tulsi Gabbard are the only two senseable candidates in the already crowded democratic presidential field. BUT sadly they will lose out to Harris Booker or Sanders because of this far left furor going on. It will be who can out "left" the rest
The overwhelming majority of legal and illegal immigrants arriving in the US are very very conservative in views and values, many Catholics. The left is importing the death of liberalism. But they are blind to it.
@ChrisJZullo @SenSanders The American people are the most heavily armed people in the world, let the government try to come for their guns and you'll have no government left when all is said and done !
@ChrisJZullo @SenSanders Tell me If a democrat ripped up the 2nd amendment and banned guns what do you leftist plan to do about all the illegal firearms that will pour over that wide open southern border you also want. NOT very smart are you illegal firearms are smuggled in every single day.
@ChrisJZullo @SenSanders The sworn duty of the Commander in chief is to protect the AMERICAN people. He is actully NOT breaking any laws of the United states constitution. I know I have it memorized. And the supreme court will agree once it makes it to the court, and it will. Just watch
@SenSanders @AOC Every single legislator who signed and supported the patriot act is guilty of the largest power overreach in modern history. That includes Robert Mueller!!! See any of them facing consequences for trampling over the 4th amendment? Dont think so
@SenSanders @AOC Trump has tons of flaws, but fighting to secure our borders is NOT one of them. It is his sworn duty as commander in cheif. To protect from all enemies foreign and domestic. What harm would come from a secure border? Dems are just afraid it will work!!!
@SenSanders @AOC Before Trump turned DACA over to Congress it was headed for the supreme court, and anyone who knows the laws of this nation knows for a fact it was going to be shot down and ruled unconstitutional, but that executive overreach was fine and dandy right?
@SenSanders @AOC Funny how all of a sudden the left is worried about giving the executive branch more power, but it was totally fine under democratic administrations for them to expand their power and overreach. Obama said he couldnt act on DACA/illegal migration 11 times!!! 11!!! And did anyways
@SenSanders @AOC America is not an authoritarian nation? These lands were conquered and settled by FORCE, by violence, that is as authoritarian as you can get.
@SenSanders @AOC Supporting illegal immigration/opposing a secure border is immoral. It is all to meet the demands of the 1% for cheap labor, they hire illegals to bypass minimum wage, labor laws, and employee taxes. They are exploiting them. And thousands have died making the dangerous journey
@SenSanders @AOC Our immigration system is built on lies, it isnt about diversity, not when 47 of 50 states have taken in the majority of their immigrants from ONE place, Mexico. Why not take a equal percentage of everyone, would that be real diversity...not just replacement.
@SenSanders @AOC What is the worst thing that would come from a wall? That it may work? Let's be HONEST if migrants in these large caravans were praising trump and the GOP Democrats would have built a wall by now you could see from space. That is the damn truth
@SenSanders Tell me how those of you who support banning firearms plan to deal with all of the illegal firearms that will pour into our nation if you get your ban...even if only semi automatic weapons are banned they will still be smuggled across the border, they are at this very moment...
@SenSanders https://t.co/tbEWnW2Q8R
The left wants no border, no wall, no barrier...and yet they want to ban guns...tell me leftist...how do you expect to stop the flow of illegal firearms across the southern border the second you get a ban...hell it is happening right now...

@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump And what will you do if Muellers investigation doesnt go the way you want it to? Assuming it will is STUPID.
@AOC Hey how about you redistribute all the millions you will soon have??? Dont want to be one of those evil 1%ers you hate so much. Tax yourself 90%
@HillaryClinton Where is your southern accent, Mrs.Clinton? Still back in the 90s?
I believe social media is and will cause a civil war in the United states. It is disturbing and saddening because it has so much potential to bring out the good in people, but it has gone dark and is bringing out their worse. It is dividing us and suppressing us.

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @USDA If this issue is not solved by the time I become eligible to run for President, I will run. And I may just run as a Democrat and return the party to sanity, true liberalism, and reject the far left madness moving into the mainstream. And fight to secure our borders.And I will win
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @USDA I have love for my fellow Americans and fellow humans from all lands, which is why I OPPOSE our failed status quo system, a system that exploits illegal migrants for cheap labor, to evade taxes and labor laws. And a system that has killed both Americans and migrants. Stop now!!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @USDA By not securing our southern border more and more migrants will believe they can cross into America unlawfully and will make the dangerous journey...And many have and will DIE along the way. That blood is on the hands of everyone who refuses to secure our borders entirely. Shame!
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @USDA This open borders and encouragement of unlawful immigration postion yourself and todays democratic party hold KILLS thousands of illegal migrants. By encouraging the dangerous deadly journey it cost lives. A trail of blood you have created by leaving our border open.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @USDA Mr.Schumer if you want to help Americans stop blocking common sense border security and own up to the position you had on illegal immigration in 2009 which was the postion 80% of Americans have on the issue, then the Gov can reopen. You've never been a fiscal hawk..why now...
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @USDA Anyone with any real education on the matter knows the reasons why you and other Democrats went from demanding secure borders and opposing illegal immigration in 2009 to fully supporting it and open borders is due to the demands of your donors for cheap labor, and future voters.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @USDA Money spent on protecting and securing The United States borders is never never never money wasted. If it saves even one American life it is worth it. If it saves even one illegal immigrants life It is worth it. Stop holding our nations very sovereignty hostage.
The cure for loneliness is not being around more people, it is to connect with someone, even just one person...

There is no such thing as a #LGBT "community" anymore, there are LGBT people and they shouldnt be lumped together. Most have nothing in common with each other. Being a gay man is a sexuality that is nothing like being #Transgendered
@codedivagames You're not even making a real attempt to live as a woman but you call yourself trans...really....People need to quit blindly buying into this it is insulting to real trans people. Stop hijacking their plight because it is "trendy" youre a dude who wears makeup that's fine be that
@codedivagames Guess what....Biology (science) is real. You're not trans if you dont have dysphoria. Putting on makeup doesnt make one trans. Being a biological gay man who is feminine doesnt make you trans. And it is insulting to real trans people.
Not long ago me and some friends met a lady on a night out, we started talking politics, she told us how she is black and trans and voted for....wait for it....#TRUMP 		#TransLooksLikeThis #trans
America is the gift that never stops giving, yet we are hated, even by those with fixed open hands who take and take and never give to us. Our generosity is taken advantage of. It is time to cut off the leeches...America FIRST, America NOW, America ALWAYS.
We have been programmed to fully accept and admire democracy, through propaganda in the media, culture, and our schools. And monarchy is demonized. Yet it is the oldest form of government in history and under monarchies we made our greatest strides.
Globalist are playing a long term game, they will use democracy to take total control. It will start with major wars (WWIII they start) then they will offer up ending nation states as a solution to end war forever, the ignorant will vote them into power...Then its game over
Democracy could be the end of our species, it allows dogma to rise to the highest positions of power, it can be used as a weapon of mass destruction. 		Democracy protects noone from authoritarianism, it empowers it.
The threat to nation states exposes the flaws and weakness of democracy
Democracy is a never ending ladder of opportunity for tyranny. 		Democracy offers no protection for minorities from majority rule when majority rule is not fair or just. 		Democracy is used by parasites to obtain power and dictate, sucking the life blood of society.
@realDonaldTrump Sorry it isnt good enough, this is the United States of America we can do better than a glorified fence.
@realDonaldTrump If I ever become President of the USA, I will fight nonstop to end ALL illegal immigrants and reform our legal immigration system. We have been taking around 1 million a year since the 90s, NOT sustainable, has to stop. Reduce it to no more than 20k annually.
@realDonaldTrump Until all 700,000 american children who are homeless are helped and every veteran and homeless American adults we should allow a single person in or help any country other than our own. Stop all foreign aide
@realDonaldTrump If not for President Trumps hardline stance on illegal immigration the thousands of Trump voters I've met would not have voted for him. That is the #1 issue that got him elected. Never forget it
@realDonaldTrump Mr.President you were elected on this issue above ALL others, and If you're reelected it will be because of this issue again. It is on your shoulders to succeed. Secure our borders, so we can move on to tackling the real beast, our legal immigration status quo system.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump The truth is people, Democrats dont want to give President Trump the funding for the wall because it will look bad for them politically, it will look like a win for him. Any intelligent individual knows this is the truth. Knowing this is the truth should boil our blood.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump And all 450k federal workers would be working and with pay if Democrats could put pride aside and fund a border wall. What is the worst that could happen...it might work. Or waste 5 billion, you politicians have never cared about being wasteful before.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump President Trump has many flaws but his  immigration policies arent one of them, in fact I wish he would take it further. It was the issue that won him the presidency and will again.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump A few weeks without pay is NOTHING compared to the suffering of the families who have losted loved ones at the hands of illegal aliens, all preventable deaths if our politicians did their duty to serve and PROTECT the AMERICAN people.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump 700,000 American children are homeless, and yet Senator Schumer rather fight for an open border and foreign aide while they suffer and die
@SenSchumer I met a girl in college who was.viciously gang raped, beaten to a pulp and left for dead by a group or ILLEGAL aliens. Her life was never the same All of them we later found out had been deported multiple times Her suffering is on the hands of all who support illegal immigration
@SenSchumer Sorry not sorry, those who believe that Democrats total flip on illegal immigration is due to them being good and moral is an utter fool. It is about meeting their donors demands for cheap labor (exploiting illegals) and building a future voting block (opposing voter ID laws)
@SenSchumer These two dont give a single damn about the American families who lost loved ones at the hands of illegal aliens, all whom would be ALIVE today if our so called leaders simply respected and enforced our sovereignty and laws. Their blood is on their hands.
@SenSchumer Over 700,000 AMERICAN CHILDREN are HOMELESS right now in 2019. Thousands of VETERANS sleep on the streets and stave. We have NO business helping a single NON American soul UNTIL EVERY American is off the streets. All who dont agree are treasonous monsters and must be opposed NOW
@SenSchumer @TheNickAdams @realDonaldTrump The blood of every American who has died at the hands of illegal aliens who's unlawful entry into this country could have been prevented is on the hands of every Democrat &amp; Republican who supports the status quo immigration system/illegal immigration, Preventable American Deaths
@SenSchumer @TheNickAdams @realDonaldTrump Americans really need to ask themselves why in a few short years have Democrats flipped on the issue of illegal immigration. Simple, to meet the demands of cheap labor for their donors. And to create a major future voting block, which is why they oppose voter ID laws. #Facts
@SenSchumer @TheNickAdams @realDonaldTrump President Obama accumulated MORE DEBT then that of ALL US Presidents before him, that is an absolute proven and irrefutable FACT. And Schumer and Pelosi ALLOWED it, now they want to act like fiscal conservatives. Bullshit, this is all about wanting to not give the pres. a win!
@SenSchumer @TheNickAdams @realDonaldTrump Democrats have no problem promising (false) "FREE" health care and education which will cost TRILLIONS, but cant muster up 5 billion for our border, what are they so afraid of...that it may work!? Because yall have had no issue wasting money in the past and present.
@SenSchumer @TheNickAdams @realDonaldTrump I truly feel for my fellow Americans who are going without pay during this shut down, But they will return to work and get back payment, meanwhile the families across this nation who lost loved ones at the hands of illegal aliens, will NEVER see their loved ones again...
@SenSchumer @TheNickAdams @realDonaldTrump 88% of Americans want a secure border and oppose UNLAWFUL immigration. Unfortunately we have a President who poorly represents needed and crucial policies an the issues of immigration. If he cant get this system fixed we will simply elect someone else who will. Mark my words
@SenSchumer @TheNickAdams @realDonaldTrump Until every American has a roof over their head, food in their stomachs, clothing and medical care YOU Senator Schumer and ALL of Congress are committing high treason against the American children. Every dollar spent on non Americans is tainted with treason
@SenSchumer @TheNickAdams @realDonaldTrump Americans first! I dont give a single damn If you're Democrat or Republican your duty is to protect and serve the AMERICAN people, not the people of Mexico, Guatemala, or anywhere else! We have 700k homeless children + countless homeless veterans SUFFERING because of our leaders
@SenSchumer @TheNickAdams @realDonaldTrump What I'll never never never in my life forget is that there are over 700,000 CHILDREN who are homeless in America RIGHT NOW in 2019, and yet our "leaders" send billions to nations who's general population hates us like Pakistan, and they give billion to helping illegal aliens.
@SenSchumer @TheNickAdams @realDonaldTrump Guess what I havent forgotten Senator Schumer the votes of Obama. H.Clinton, and YOU and many other Democrats in favor of a border barrier and your many speeches AGAINST illegal immigration!!! Neither has other informed Americans
Lets be REAL if thousands of illegal migrants marched in caravans to our southern border praising @realDonaldTrump and the GOP, Democrats would have built a wall by now that you could see from space!!! #DemocraticResponse #democrats #immigration #wall
Myself and the overwhelming majority of American citizens, do not hate #immigrants. We simply ask that our laws and sovereignty be upheld, respected and enforced. There are over 700k HOMELESS children in America, NOONE should EVER come before helping them. NOONE!!! #AmericanFirst

Democrats always say "the wall wont work" so what are they so afraid of? Wasting money? No,  What they are afraid of is it actually  working, otherwise they wouldnt care. If migrants started chanting pro trump sentiment they would have built a wall by now you could see from space
@thePoWer_RangeR @GovernorDeal @BrianKempGA @gdecd Just because you dont like him doesn't make him illegitimate. The votes were counted and counted, the people of Georgia made their choice and it should be respected. I'd say the same had Abrams won fairly. Stop blindly believing what the media tells you to believe, facts matter.
@GovernorDeal Thank you Gov Deal for making Georgia great again! The state has thrived under your leadership/policies. Just viewed the job numbers, Georgia now has the 9th largest economy (and growing) in the country, very impressive! 		Thanks again from this Savannahian. CJF
The problem with #immigration and it has been going on for decades, is that our politicans and the wealthy have dictated immigration policies and have given we average American citzens NO say over it, and the policies in many ways harm Americans. They dont care about you, or me.
In recent years the United States has seen record numbers of new immigrants (typically 1mil. legal immigrants annually &amp; growing) this floods the market with cheap labor which drives down American wages, &amp; drives up competition for jobs, making them harder for natives to obtain.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump will you please inform the American people of any plans you may have on fixing the issues of legal immigration (chain migration/diversity lotto) and how long will the US take 1 MILLION in legally each year, its unsustainable sir. 	Thank you! -CJF
There is a large and ever growing movement in the USA to form a new nation, to do so they demonize and put down Americas identity and founding. They attack the constitution and our history (monuments, symbols and more) as racist and therefore invalid. We have to fight back
In the western world (USA and Europe most of all) we have two types of citizens those who have forgotten or lost their identities, and those who are fighting to retain and maintain theirs from those who do not have them. And it couldnt come at a worse time.... #USA #Europe
All across #Europe we see falling birthrates, unassimilated #immigrants (tension between natives and immigrants), stagnant unstable economies, the failing of the European project, healthcare crisis &amp; more. They have failed future generations beyond imagination. Civil wars to come
@MittRomney If you had an ounce of the passion for attacking President Obama that you have attacking President Trump you would have been the 45th President of the United States, not him. 		Are you really a Republican?	Be a Republican 		Stop the far left/far right's madness
@realDonaldTrump You should have had it funded and built the first year of your presidency sir. 		And we didnt vote for you for a fence, or partial border wall. 		Make it happen! You said, "I alone can fix it" so fix it, the people have given you the most powerful postion on earth. 		Be a dragon
The Truth about #Romney 's #Oped : Pres.Trump dishes out personal attacks to other Republicans, often unprovoked and personal ones, it is unproductive, sometimes does more harm than good. Same can be said for Romney now, his criticism is unproductive, accomplishes nothing.
Psychopaths are born	Sociopaths are made
@MaryLuca70 Ending ANY heart beat deliberately is MURDER. Dont be delusional it isnt even cute

@MaryLuca70 By your own logic people in comas and vegetative states, arent people so they can be terminated and it isnt murder right... I mean they have heart beats just like babies in the womb but they arent really "there" now are they....be consistent!!!

The government should NOT punish women for having abortions most do not know of the scientific recent discoveries on abortion, like the fact that we now know the babies feel/respond to the pain/death But the doctors know and what should be done about that  #prolife #prochoice
Are there any Democrats who are #prochoice but believe having multiple abortions should be strongly discouraged and prevented by whatever the most effective means are, including legal consequences.
@realDonaldTrump Lets be real and speak the truth for a moment...if these illegal immigrants marching to our border were singing Trumps praises Democrats would have built a wall by now that you could see from space!!
@Kymmie10 Please laugh...I love it :-) yall laughed when I said Trump would win to. Please keep it up! I get a kick out of it :-)
If Rand Paul runs for President again mark my words, he will win by a landslide

@NoMoreMrNiceGa1 I know plenty of people who would be hurt and offended over your Twitter handle, not myself I couldnt care less, but using "gay" which is the identity of millions of people in a humorous like it is a joke is very offensive to them, homophobic even, how do you answer to them...
@NoMoreMrNiceGa1 The narratives you push are only going to cause more homophobic people to NOT evolve their views and values.
@NoMoreMrNiceGa1 There are "homophobic" people by the ton who have evolved and are no longer homophobic should they be judged for the rest of their lives for it? NO. Would you like to be judged for the rest of your life over a part of your past? You're not innocent.
@HockeyTarheel @NoMoreMrNiceGa1 To lump all white evangelicals together and then slam them with labels is ignorant and bigoted, and racist considering you singled out "white" evangelicals.
@marcorubio Please run for President again Senator Rubio, we NEED YOU!
One thing I know to be an absolute truth is that our #media relies on sensationalism, Whatever headline or soundbite will enrage you the most is always always first pick. Dont fall into this trap we live in reactionary times THINK before you react, Ignore headlines,READ substance
Whatever gets repeated is remembered, whatever is remembered gets done. This is how Trump works over the media. As long as he remains the story at all times he lives in your mind and noone else comes through.
Presidents should not be publically commenting on pending and open cases involving private citzens of the United States, Or on justice department employees of any level who are on active cases. I'd say this no matter who the president is. It is an abuse of power.
@NoMoreMrNiceGa1 Dr.King was a preacher who would likely oppose the anti Christian and anti semitism on the modern left. That is far more likely than him supporting gay marriage.
@NoMoreMrNiceGa1 It is Democrats who are judging the past by the ethical and moral standards of TODAY not us independents/libertarians/Republicans. The problem is they selectively do it, they pick targets to direct it act. Kevin Hart happens to be in their eyesight.
@EdKrassen @BarackObama Healthcare is a service NOT a "right" of any kind, we are NOT born entitled to healthcare or to anyones service. If that is what you want move to the nearest socialist/communist gov. (Sweden Norway Finland are capitalist free markets with social democracy/welfare, FACTS)
@EdKrassen @BarackObama The government FORCING citizens to buy any product or service (including healthcare) is wrong and disgusting,  then issuing fines to those who cant afford it is just plain evil. Why dont you educate yourself on the facts, talk to the 11 MILLION uninsured Americans who got screwed
@EdKrassen @BarackObama So first of all the individual mandate did NOT play a factor in the ruling. It made no difference on the outcome. Second the Federal Judge knows more about the law then you ever will. Lastly, the gov forcing citizens to buy/participate in ANYTHING is DISGUSTING Have a lovely day!
@BarackObama Cant afford it, oh the irony...disappointed
@Alig_Aligula photo of you on Elle magazines YouTube page from a short doc. https://t.co/McQGiNotX2
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Wrong, it was found to be unconstitutional even WITHOUT the individual mandate!
@realDonaldTrump Hey people left and right, you cant just support and believe judges when things go "your way" so all of you who have praised the judges (9th circuit) that have challenged Trumps policies but now are bashing this federal judge on Obamacare, you look like major hypocrites
#CNN #MSNBC Watching these networks the last couple of years has become worse than getting ones fingernails peeled off with pliers. It is bash Pres.Trump 24/7 fest and it is so unbearable Their world revolves around this one man, meanwhile people are left in the dark to real news
Incredible things happen every day there is so much love, courage and hope in the world but you'll never hear about it if you turn on #CNN or #MSNBC In fact, every single American knows the ONLY thing they ever talk about now is #TRUMP so they ONLY tune in to see what he is up to
Messages of love, hope, passion, inspiration, courage, and peace are NOT popular...Those stories get NO air time on #CNN #MSNBC the whole lot of them. Hate and Fear sells and #Trump is their greatest gift, their Boogeyman in the flesh!! Ratings!!!
@RosieTylerGreig @ShiriEisner Hos about stop creating more labels to throw at people, it solves NO problems, it only creates more. And when you use labels like "sexist, racist, bigot ext." Out of context and unjustly you strip the very power away from them rendering them useless and that hurts everyone
@RosieTylerGreig @ShiriEisner Ridiculous
Sorry not sorry it disgust me when Americans who live like bloody Royalty whine about being #Oppressed and #victims while there are millions ENSLAVED at this very moment in parts of Africa, Asia and the middle east....makes me SICK to my stomach thinking about it
Millions are enslaved in the world TODAY in 2018 in parts of Africa, Asia, and the middle east...Yet we hear nothing about them from the media, the obsess over Pres.Trump and ignore evils and injustices to fester around the world. Shame on you all #CNN #ABC #NBC #Foxnews #MSNBC
More than 18 million slaves were taken and sold by muslims and other fellow Africans to the middle east and Asia. But we almost never hear about them, why? Brazil took in the largest amount of slaves during the Atlantic slave trade, we never hear about them, why?
Dems are bashing/demonizing #KevinHeart over old comments they say are "homophobic" Do they not know #MLK was anti gay, and a letter he sent in reply to a young gay boy is public record, and would be called homophobic by todays standards (that is how they demand we are to judge)
Democrats demand that we judge the past by the moral and ethical standards of today, remove all confederate monuments and sysmbols, they say. Since The democratic party was the party of slavery/jim crow when are their statues and symbols coming down..I want to know!!!! #democrats
Democrats want us to judge the past by the ethical and moral standards of TODAY (Dangerous ideology) yet when you bring up the irrefutable fact that the Democratic party was the party of slavery and Jim Crow suddenly that ideology goes out the window....

@realDonaldTrump Why is Trumps team allowing this? President Trump do you not realize the implications of publically speaking on this investigation over and over...they will use your own words against you and twist them to back up their arguments....
We have been fed this lie that race and gender determine everything, that causes so many people to fail and to not work hard for opportunities and to doubt themselves and distrust and judge everyone. It is toxic and dangerous
@realDonaldTrump 1,000 years from now the history books wont remember all of the fake media scandals that have raged Trumps Presidency. They will however remember the President and his policies and how he forever left his mark on American politics and history.
@realDonaldTrump President Trumps policies and actions prove one thing for certain, He is the toughest Pres. on Russia that we have had since the cold war, period. His polices are the opposite of what Russia wants and his policies strength our postion above theirs #CNN #MSNBC
Trumps biggest flaws are his mouth and his ego... he isnt a polished well spoken career poltican who tells you what you want to hear and stays on script, but many of his policies have been very successful. Example, the US will meet its carbon goals without the Paris accord!
@realDonaldTrump The media always focuses in on Pres Trumps words (not his strong suit) to distract from his wildly successful ACTIONS  Pres Trump is more than a President he is a rare historical figure that comes along once in a generation 1000yrs still remembered #Trump #CNN
@realDonaldTrump Why doesn't anyone give Pres.Trump credit when he does things right? Actions/Issues/Policies will always trump words. The media covers up his great successes no matter how positive like the #RighttotryBill + more. Shame on the #Media #CNN #msnbc #NewYorkTimes
@EmmanuelMacron Tyrant
When the left speaks of diversity they literally mean RACIAL diversity (LESS white people), they do NOT mean diversity of thought and opinion. If every migrant started voting Republican they would flip the script in a millisecond.
@run4urmny @realDonaldTrump Funny how leftist say the Christian missionary who was killed entering an isolated tribe "had it coming" and "it's their land" but when we simply deter people without lethal force it's a "crime against humanity"
@run4urmny @realDonaldTrump There is evidence that these migrants use children as a shield, because they know nations dont want to hurt them, bad PR, and it's horrible in general. Their PARENTS hold responsibility KNOWINGLY involving their children in criminal activity, we have sovereignty!
From strong leadership comes unity, from unity comes power
When you're fat it's time for a nap! lol
The 4th industrial revolution is on the horizon, it will change every thing we are and know as human beings. After much thought I truly hope this can be prevented but it has already begun...our technology is surpassing our humanity...everything of nature will die....
#Liberals are not stupid and #conservatives are not nazis 		This fighting is exactly what our evil oligarchs want they want us to demonize/demoralize each other so we will not hesitate to KILL each other in the war they seek As long as we fight each other we aren't fighting them
When you do not vote, you forfeit your voice, betray yourself, and allow others to speak for you and dictate who will represent YOU and policies that will directly effect YOUR life. Not voting is a right, but it doesn't make it right #vote
@EmmanuelMacron	Le président Macron est un tyran ... Traître au peuple français, la France a besoin d'un roi, et son nom ne sera pas Macron! #France #Macron #EU
@sissylynn55 @Acosta His poll numbers are HIGHER now than when he was elected, Fact. His approval ratings are HIGHER than President Obama's were at this point in his presidency. And Democrats failed to retake the Senate and 3 of their "stars" (beto, Abrams, and Gillum) FAILED. Wake up
Believe in your own achievements before national achievements.
@MariahCarey	"Feelin my self like I'm Norma Jean"	#CautionMariahCarey This album is FIRE!!!
@whatyoudontwan1 @Acosta @dianahcloer Amen amen amen you're 100% correct
@ArtisticTrend73 @Acosta What questions?? You mean arguing. Journalist dont ask questions then interrupt before the person can answer and try to shout over them and deliberately provoke them.
@Acosta Everyone who has studied journalism/communications in college like myself knows you're only doing what you're told to do by the higher ups at CNNs parent company. You may have the ignorant fooled, but not all of us.
@Acosta I DARE YOU to PUBLICALLY apologize to The over 60 million American citizens who voted for Trump AND tell them you love and respect them. Haha BUT WE ALL KNOW YOU WONT. You dont have the courage to and you know youd be risking your job
@Acosta "We are on the same team" says the guy who was unknown until repeatedly attacking this administration out of line for fame and attention. Who regularly demonizes a President half the bloody country voted for.
@Acosta You have repeatedly trashed over 60 million Americans who voted for this President, and now you have the nerve to lecture them on how you're not their enemy, well if you truly arent then act like it!!!!! Cause you sure in the hell arent right now
@Acosta You're seeking fame and to further your career, it is painfully obvious to anyone who knows the game. You may have some on the left fooled, but this liberal isnt !
@Acosta Because of YOU and people like YOU myself and thousands of other people who are on the path to journalism are changing fields, you should be ashamed, but you dont give a single damn.
@Acosta History will NOT remember your name, But it will remember President Trumps for a thousand years.
@cspan @CNN @Acosta This was never a first amendment issue, the judge made that clear, this was a 5th amendment issue over due process. But if it goes to the supreme court they will rule in Trumps favor, and they should love him or hate him he is right about this.
@cspan @CNN @Acosta Just watch, I can promise you Trump will never call on him again, and acosta only has himself to blame. And If he keeps up his antics Pres.Trump will walk off he has stated, and Then acosta is going to have to face the real journalists in the room who he screws over
@cspan @CNN @Acosta History will NOT remember his name, but President Trump will be remembered for a thousand years.
@cspan @CNN @Acosta People like Acosta are the very reason why I and countless others have turned away from work in the media, he should be ashamed, but he doesn't care that he is disgracing the good name of journalism. He is a egotistical little man seeking fame.
@cspan @CNN @Acosta I dont care if you're right or left, what Acosta is doing is NOT Noble in any way shape or form, only a true fool would believe it is.
@cspan @CNN @Acosta Freedom of the press doesn't give you the right to act like a selfish beast, it also doesn't give you the right to disrupt others freedom. Jim Acosta is out for fame, he is hungry for it and has shown he will go to great lengths to get it. He is pathetic
Everyday people call suicide victims cowards, weak, and selfish. It boils my blood, first of all most suicides do it because they see themselves as the problem and a burden on loved ones, they feel like it is selfless and will help the ones they love.
I posted a few post on YouTube rasing awareness on the suicide epidemic and the fact that white men account for the majority. So far I've been getting replies like this," I hope every white man in America kills themselves it will be a better place" the left says that isnt racist
Heart broken hearing the news about our fellow citizens who have passed and those who are suffering due to the California wildfires. I know action is needed, but all I have to offer is my thoughts and prayers, I love you, the country loves you, God bless you. #CaliforniaFires
Indigenous Americans have extremely high suicide rates, my heart bleeds for them, If any of you read this I want you to know I love you, I'm here for you anytime, I will talk to anyone in need, you're not alone... #SuicidePrevention #NativeAmerican #indigenous
Everyone should be asking what is making 45,000 Americans take their lives each year, their desperation and hopelessness should cause us to act, but so many suffer in silence, stop stigmatization and demonizing suicide people, we must do everything we can to help them
Every year 45,000 people in the USA commit suicide, that is almost double the homicide rate The majority are white + male, that is why the media is ignoring this heartbreaking epidemic..I will fight till the day I die to raise awareness, my brothers you wont be forgotten #Suicide
The USA has been taking around 1 million lawful immigrants in per year. They arent the ones who need it most they are doctors, lawyers, business owners and such. And we take them away from countries that need them and its destabilizing the world over time.
Immigration is fine but it should be sensible and good for the native people. Citizens of ALL nations should have the right to say when enough is enough. Many euro nations in a century are likely to have more foreign than native born citizens. That is called replacement.
The United States is a nation of immigrants, that is true. But most European nations are not. If native Europeans lose their nations, that is it there is no going back. No other true homeland. Even the Dali Lama said Europe is for Europeans. 	Just like Japan is for the Japanese
Sjws love to bring up the fact that Native Americans were on this land first therefore whites have no right to an opinion on immigration. But then they turn around and defend Palestine even though Jews inhabited the land thousands of years before Mohammed was even born. Hypocrisy
Want to expose the madness that is #SJWs ideologies? Make a joke about Christians, step back and watch their response, then make a joke about muslims and step back and watch the outrage that ensues... I dare you
One of the worst ideologies the modern left has fully embraced is this notion that we must judge the past by the moral and ethical standards of today. It is extremely dangerous, in fact it is there MOST dangerous agenda. #democrats #leftist
Anyone, most of all politicians who says that you "shouldnt think this way, you shouldnt say that, you shouldnt do this, you shouldnt post this" should be avoided like the plague. Fight for your independence of thought and speech.
I oppose our status quo immigration system because it literally kills immigrants and citizens, and it is destabilizing the world and has serious long term destructive effects on the United States
One thing I'll never forget from my college years is giving a speech on immigration, in my open I made sure to state "this has NOTHING to do with race, everything to do with facts" despite that, one individual walked out on my speech and cried.
Maiores autem cotidie viam meam

America is in the midst of a dangerous storm, tribalism, the question is, can we survive it, can we whether this storm and one day return to clear skies, Nothing empowers our oligarchy more than division, They fear a United American people, only then can we reclaim the power
The right believes it is fighting for capitalism and patriotism meanwhile it is their leaders who have them fooled into fighting for corrperatism not capitalism. And fighting to preserve imperialism and the rule of our oligarchs.
The left believes it is fighting against oppression they dont understand that their leaders have them doing their dirty work to push an agenda playing on their mortalities to oppress opposition to the leaders powers..Our entire nation is In great danger...
The political left and right in this country have become cults, small groups that hold power are advancing agendas and pushing them through subversion. And the followers buy into false narratives and sinister ideologies unknowingly, believing they are virtuous and righteous.
The values that glue our country together such as #Freespeech Presumption of innocence, Individualsim,.patriotism and more have been under total assault across college campuses and the private sector. That is why we are divided. If we dont push back we may lose everything
What is happening on college campuses across America is about power and control, dictation of speech and the suppression of speech is a tool of control to force opposition to this far left Marxist movement into total submission. It is a symptom of a larger disease. #college
Because of the long term effects of Nazi Germany Europeans have lost their identity and christendom. Yet foolish neo nazis are so stupid they dont realize that. The nazis did more to hurt Europeans than anyone in all of modern history.
Neo Nazis claim to hate communism so much yet it is because of Hitler that half of Germany was ruled by communist for decades. Hitler did more to destroy germans and Germany herself than anyone else. Fuck Hitler
One major example of how stupid nazis are is that they believe That Hitler and the Nazis were for the German people. In reality noone has killed more germans and destroyed Germany herself than Hitler and the nazis. They are responsible for over 8 million German deaths
Communism and Nazism should both be fought against. As they are the ideoglies that have killed more human beings than ANY others.
@DoqxaScott Yes but I dont think that would be the right course
Denial is the root of every mental illness. Delusion is the active side effect.
The United States will never become a monarchy at least no time soon. And I'm NOT advocating for that, I'm advocating for the return of monarchy (with reforms and conditions) to nations like #France #Iran and #Russia
Would you rather have a monarch who is raised and groomed/trained and educated every single day to govern and lead, one who sees all citzens as equal and as family OR a career politican who is owned by corporate intrest? And be ruled by oligarchy #monarchy vs #democracy #republic
Never confuse corporatism with capitalism
The left moralizes food (veganism)	The right moralizes the body (sex/tattoos)
Economic nationalism is NOTHING like ethnic nationalism #Nationalism
Americans have been lied to an taught a alternative, scripted, crafted, prepackaged version of American and world history. Those of us who have come to realize this have so because we made the choice to educate ourselves and seek the real truth. Now it's time to educate others...
America actually has three branches of government: Executive,Legislative,Judicial AND the "administrative state/massive government bureaucracy/unaccountable non democratic agencies" which are all intertwined. BOTH parties contributed, and we must clean up their mess....
Today I heard a white Democrat ask a conservative black man if he "identifies as black". Apparently dems like her believe that even if you have black skin you're not truly black unless you conform to their way of thinking. This is true #RACISM #BlackLivesMatter #democrats #dems
Since 1973 over 17 MILLION BLACK BABIES have been aborted by #PlannedParenthood what happened to the left wanting diversity and helping the black community...what happened to #BlackLivesMatter ? Do those black babies lives not matter? This is GENOCIDE!!!!! #democrats #Abortion
@WBeggins And no I dont get butthurt that is reserved for you left wing/right wing basket cases
@WBeggins Trump is still your President, you mad?
Humanity regresses, progresses, regresses, progresses....then resets
Masculine order, Hierarchy and human nature, the case for monarchy in the modern world, illusion of equality, the truth behind diversity, the fall of Christiandom, female on male abuse, fundamentalism and Islamism, dictation and control of speech and thought.
The effects of lacking reason, revisionist history taught in schools and long term consequences, anti white racism/revenge racism, virtueism self obsession, the absence of community in America, ancestral pride and burden, psychological/political slavery.
More areas of research: the effect of religion on the human psyche, Superficalism/Materialism traits found in narrccastist/sociopaths, the effects of addiction mimicking sociopathic traits, isolation and loneliness, national pride, and anti patriotism in individuals.
My areas of research include: The effects of social media and technology on child development, The effects of technology and social media on adult relationships, the death of monogamy and chivalry, The power of human thought on physical reality, Obsessive political disorder.
I was born a leader, and I dont seek followers...I seek to inspire the leaders in others...
Choice is not the only thing that determines fate or outcomes while it is a major factor things like  luck/circumstance and even genetics do as well. Alot of American conservatives dont understand this nor do most of the wealthy. And it is a problem.

RT @cvpayne: Honestly if a Fox reporter pushed away a young intern and spoke to President Obama the way Jim Acosta did yesterday what would…
@katinthehat212 @Acosta He has lost his white house press pass and rightfully so. And I dont care if it was Hillary Clinton I would be saying the same damn thing. I'm not a biased blinded political hack like you
@katinthehat212 @Acosta One can ask any question they want but there is a right and wrong way. He didnt have to be a total douchebag about it but he was
@katinthehat212 @Acosta And it's not about the questions he asked it is the fact that he always ask questions intended to cause a negative reaction, loaded questions. And he believes his opinions equal fact and they dont!
@katinthehat212 @Acosta He never said it was an accident he totally denied it even though its ON VIDEO!!! And she had every right to take back that mic
@katinthehat212 @Acosta Ah the leftist spin has arrived! You're just as bad as the right wing crazies. You're ONLY defending him because he is "on your team" you're blinded to the fact that he acted unprofessional and without class and dignity.
@Acosta You also assulted a female staffer you put your hands on her IT IS ON VIDEO so everyone with vision can see it and knows you're lying. You should issue her a public apology you sexist bigot.
@Acosta Journalism has no place for sociopaths like you. We need journalists who dont act like teenage bullies, it gives you NO right to call Pres.Trump one when you do the exact same
@Acosta You're too blinded by your ego to take even an once of self responsibility. Which reflects on your poor character. You dont have to like Pres.Trump, you can be a decent person and journalist and not like a Pres. But the fact that everyone knows it shows how horrible you are
@Acosta I was a communications major (emphasis tv journalism and electronic media) people like you pushed me and countless others away from this path. And you should be ashamed. Ashamed that you have disgraced the good name of journalism and put an ugly stain on it forever.
@Acosta You don't deserve to ever set foot in the White house again, not just under the Trump administration but all future administrations as well.
@Acosta No, just YOU and the few others like YOU
@Acosta.@realDonaldTrump Not only are you a disgrace to the company you represent, you dishonor and disgrace the American people. I think you're upset that history won't even remember your name... but It will remember Pres.Donald Trumps for 1,000years. Shame #CNN
I wonder how risky it would be to do my thesis on the power of human thought on physical reality.....
Our lives are stories that we write as we go along
@realDonaldTrump BAN Jim Acosta from ever stepping foot inside or even near the white house again!! You have the authority and if CNN doesn't like it ban them ALL! Revoke their press passes/clearance

Public Judgement is all we need, we dont NEED the media, nothing is wrong with it continuing, but we dont NEED them as they claim. #media
The left #democrats believe that in order to fight racism you must obsessively talk about it, and look for it everywhere, in doing so they actually fuel racism. Racism will only die the day noone talks about it anymore
The left #democrats believe racism and white privilege are rampant in America, they think they have never had it worse. Their audacity and ignorance is astonishing...#racism
The #democrats fully support many forms of racism, from anti white racism to their racist ideology that demands ALL minorities conform to their views and agree with them. When they dont they resort to calling names like uncle tom and coon and house ni**er. #racism
Real racism is a matter of the heart, if you're white or black or any other race and you hate either your own race or others or believe in any form of racial superiority/inferiority you're a racist. #racism
#Racism by definition is the belief that a race or certain races are superior or inferior to another or others. ANYONE of ANY race can be racist. The left wants to write the definition so that only whites can be racist because they hold power. They diminish the effect of the term

@xjhannon @realDonaldTrump 64 million people left their jobs and homes to vote for Donald Trump, if you actually think that he needs to pay people to come or make small venues pack then you're an absolute fool. I dare you to go to a Trump rally, at an major arena, he does it alot. Ask the people
@xjhannon @realDonaldTrump Nothing about your statement has any truth to it, I've been to multiple rallies (massive venues), I've met him, and I've look into the claims of paid actors and they are FALSE however there are paid actors mainly at protest on the left and there is a paper trail to prove it,SOROS
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo Pres.Trump is not an intellectual he is not articulate, but he is simply doing what he promised his voters he would do. For once a president is keeping his promises. Why the shock? Not used to it....
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo I believe "climate change" is real in a sense, depending on how one defines it. But it wont bring drastic change this century. If it was you'd see no investments being made in coastal regions prone to future changes in coastline. Most of all from the banks.
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo The two big problems with climate change are 	#1 The name, climate change, the climate always changes has since it's very formation and always will change. There needs to be a new term. 	#2 hysteria over climate change pushes people alway from truth, always will, education is key
@CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo John Trump also worked with Nikola Telsa which is revolutionizing the electric automobile industry, which helps the environment.

@doris23x @realDonaldTrump Stacy Abrams the democratic nominee owed hundreds of thousands in back taxes yet has given over that amount to her campaign. She also OPENLY said that "undocumented" immigrants will be voting in the upcoming election. That is HIGHLY ILLEGAL.
@doris23x @realDonaldTrump You have no idea what you're talking about, Those registrations had errors on them, some belong to people who registered multiple times under different names, some dead, some moved out of state. I didnt vote for Kemp I supported Tippens, but what Kemp did is NOT unlawful.
Americans protection from government is provided by our constitution, it also provides us protection by the government, which is it's intended function.
Government has always been mankinds greatest enemy. Over 100 MILLION human beings in the last century alone have been killed by their own governments. Our constitution has been designed to not to trust government, to keep it in check and in control of the people by the people
Charity is NOT a function of government, it is a function of the individual. Welfare shouldnt act as a charity, it was intended to be security for when those citizens who have paid into it should so need it....
The war on drugs has been lost, drugs won
The constitution is against majority rule. Examples: the President is not elected via popular vote, the veto giving the president the power to override 500+ people in the house.
The United States is NOT a Democracy we are a Constitutional Republic with elected representation. Democracy leads to tyranny, mob majority rule (and the majorty isnt always right), and discourse.

Those who have made false accusations of #rape #sexualassualt destroy the lives of the accused and hurt real victims who need to be heard and beleived. Knowingly making false accusations should be a mandatory 10 years or more behind bars. That would help true victims tremendously https://t.co/yt574d70zM
Shame on #CNN #MSNBC and ALL of these so called journalist who beleive they are judge and jury....they are NOT!!!
Is due process dead? When crimes are ALLEGED the WORST thing anyone can do is rush to assumptions and judgements. All sides involved should be heard and evidence provided. We are innocent until PROVEN guilty. Lives have been ruined.
@MeanOlLiberal @realDonaldTrump You do realize that the FBI historically does not look into these such matters, the white house can.
I think it is so incredibly irresponsible/reckless for #media figures to be encouraging sexual crime victims to wait to come forward. No, it is important to encourage victims to come forward immediately so crucial evidence can be collected, the media is helping offenders #MeToo

@realDonaldTrump Alot of Americans in November 2016 did not vote for Pres.Trump because they didn't believe he could win...They looked at the polls...but now they know he can win and many will turn out In 2020 because of that factor. He very well could win the popular vote this time....
@billmaher here are two #socialists	entities you should have mentioned:	USSR=Union of Soviet SOCIALIST republics 	NAZI= National SOCIALIST German workers party
@billmaher Learn the differences between socialism and social democracy within capitalist market based economies. I thought you were the last real liberal left, I expect better. #Socialism
@billmaher Just listened to #BillMaher 's rant on what socialism is...Here is what socialism really is: Control over the means of production, theft via mass taxation, responsible for millions of deaths around the world, and the 20th century's greatest failure.
@amyallantdf Happy Birthday:-)
@amyallantdf  hi amy! It's my best friend Steven's birthday he is a medium, loves your show, says you have taught him alot https://t.co/zRaI1ika7C
I'd double the education budget by ending several tax loopholes, and through tax incentives and credits. I'd also fight the rich on offshore accounts. Other state level taxes would also factor in.
If I was President I would double the education budget. And send far more Grants. I'd also try to help create competitive pay for teachers people should look into it. Lastly I would want to reform school schedules and work with many to help reform our entire approach. #education

@HillaryClinton @KamalaHarris The government can decide if a male body goes to war oh and suffers and dies....tell me one law that does the same to women...cause last I checked they cant be drafted
@HillaryClinton @KamalaHarris Hey Hillary Clinton so does this mean we can expect you to support drafting women?
@HillaryClinton @KamalaHarris Ever heard of this thing called the draft...I'm sure you have which means you're deliberately pushing a lie. And shame on Kavanaugh for not mentioning the draft, but hey if he did theyd call it sexist...

@Kaepernick7 Funny I never expected so many socialist to love a capitalist product so much and praise a massive for profit major international corporation....(that has a past with exploiting slave labor). How interesting.....
@Kaepernick7 More people are enslaved right now in 2018 than anytime before in documented history. Some estimates say up to 46 million are enslaved including slave labor which #NIKE exploited for PROFIT...why are Kaepernick and all who claim to be social justice warriors silent? Complicit...
@Kaepernick7 Thanks to the Clinton's inaction, 500,000–2,000,000 Rowandans were killed in a mass genocide. How much did Nike help with donations?? Oh that's right they were exploiting slave labor at that time...
@Kaepernick7 This amazes me...people are willing to condemn Roseanne (who is a Jewish woman) for making a racist joke and apologizing for the rest of her life but Nike which exploited SLAVE LABOR in third world countries get forgiven and a privileged ball player gets a deal..social justice?NO
@Kaepernick7 Ah Kaepernick the hypocrisy is really astonishing...Claiming to be a advocate for "social justice" doing a deal with a major brand like Nike which exploits SLAVE LABOR in third world countries....

There is nothing noble about stealing the earnings of the labor of others in the name of social "justice"...#Socialism #SocialistSunday #Socialismsucks #socialjustice theft isnt just...#TaxationIsTheft

@HillaryClinton If todays democratic party was the party of JFK or even Bill Clinton I wouldn't mind voting blue, but it just isnt anymore it's the party of Marxist like Sanders, Cortez, and Warren. People will swallow the rights morality flaws rather than vote in the far left!
@HillaryClinton I will never vote Democrat again unless they reject this far left lunacy and return to real liberal values and return to supporting not hating this country and those who serve it.

Although I disagreed with most of  President #Obama policies, I think he is a great father and husband. And he is a excellent speaker.
If I was POTUS I would make it very clear, publicly, that I will NOT recognize Iran's Murderous Islamic radical regime as a legitimate government. Id fully support the Iranian people rejecting the murderous regime. And I would support Reza Pahlavi 100% #ShahofIran

Almost all religions today incorporated paganism to gain converts
#Islam #christianity #judaism owe their existences to Zoroastrianism.
Any nation that gives its people NO say over immigration is condemning itself to a premature death.
Americas immigration today and for many years has overwhelmingly been unbalanced. In 1950 3 to 4 states took in majorty of their immigrants from Mexico today 36 states take majorty from Mexico. That is NOT diversity that is replacement #Immigration #Mexico 	#diversity
The rights of sexual and religious minorities are in danger in any nation with mass immigration from religiously conservative nations
Those supporting #multiculturalism  	need to realize the more cultures you bring in the more views you bring in. Central and Southern American Catholics and Muslims from nations in Africa, Asia and the middle east are EXTREMELY conservative. Get ready #liberals #progressives

@MichaelRapaport @realDonaldTrump You hate Trump because of his character then turn around and show your character flaw by spewing vulgarity and nastiness. Try making your point with some class and civility next time or you have no room to criticize!
@MichaelRapaport @realDonaldTrump Wow how classy
@realDonaldTrump Anyone else notice those who turn on Trump or already hate him always seek a reaction out of him, they know he will respond and they take advantage, the media LOVES it, I say ignore them all!
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President DJT, The American people want you to return your focus and work back on the MAGA agenda. They see your policy wins left and right. Midterms are close, dont let Omarosa be a distraction...That is what the Democrats want!!! They want focus on scandals not your success
@realDonaldTrump Omarosa was a opportunist... hiring her Mr.President simply because you believed she was loyal because she spoke highly of you was bad judgement sir. Leave it at that it isnt worth wasting another millisecond of your presidency on, The American people have never trusted her

Since Facebook is acting as a publisher they should be subjected to libel laws. 	#Facebook #Facebookban
@HumanistReport Democrats and Republicans come out in droves to support the banning or silencing of people on the other side, then whine when it happens to theirs. It is sickening yall disgust me. Either you support ALL free speech or you cant claim to support free speech.

@RGanley I bet you everything had the RNC hack happened and emails were leaked showing their corruption and rigging of an election the Democrats would love it. They would be singing a entirely different tune now. And had Hillary won we would hear very little about Russian interference
@RGanley By the way The leaked emails from the hack are all factual. The emails were not fake. They exposed deep seeded corruption. The only negative thing about it is the media should have did that NOT foreign officials.
@RGanley Russia didnt hack the DNC to help elect Trump they never thought he could win. Their aim was to weaken the next president who they believed would be Hillary Clinton like everyone else
@RGanley Every president of the United states has and must maintain peace with the Russian federation. Do you expect Trump to insult and bash Putin to his face? Trump is soft on Putin with his words but his polcies are harsher on Russia than the last admin. BY FAR
@RGanley very little,and noone can deny that they went easy on the Obama administration and that the level of scrutiny we see now towards the new administration is off the charts. All these networks are biased and have agendas, CNN Fox NBC the whole lot of them. I was communications major
@vincentkaprat Obama was a great father and husband, a excellent speaker, and deep down I think he truly beleived he was doing the right thing. But his policies were harmful. Trump is the exact opposite horrible character flaws but great policy successes
@vincentkaprat Obama's aim was to destroy the secular syrian state. He allied armed and trained rebel groups that turned out to be Islamist not moderates. Many were former Al Qaeda members and many joined ISIS.
@vincentkaprat The department of defense in 2015 stated that Pres.Obama/his administration LIED about progress being made in regards to the fight against Isis-Isil
@vincentkaprat They should have, I'm critical of the bias on right and left wing networks. Their narrative on immigration was false to an extent, sanctuary cities coverage was accurate though and other point. Terrorism I could write a book on. Obama also destabilized Syria and Libya.

@SenSanders I know that some people in the US associate the Nordic model with some sort of socialism. Therefore I would like to make one thing clear. Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.-PM of Denmark
social democracy, is a system in which the government aims to promote the public welfare through heavy taxation and spending, within the framework of a capitalist economy. That is not #socialism
While it is true that the #Scandinavian countries provide things like a generous social safety net and universal healthcare, an extensive welfare state is not the same thing as #socialism. What #Sanders and his supporters confuse as socialism is actually social #democracy
Social Democracy is NOT democratic socialism. 		FYI The United States is a constitutional republic with democratically elected representation not a democracy.
Democratic socialism purports to combine majority rule with state control of the means of production. 	#Socialism #DemocraticSocialist
#Socialism has been put to the ultimate test and has failed...what was that test? The 20th century. And NO people Scandinavian nations arent socialist nations.

He speaks from profound ignorance and insecurity and his deep seeded lack of courage for his convictions is easy to identify. Coward
@mshafiquk @MaajidNawaz MOHAMMED your jewaphobia and Christianphobia is on full display
@mshafiquk @MaajidNawaz Islamaphobia is NOT real. Any intelligent wise human being knows it.
@mshafiquk @MaajidNawaz Douglas Murray is without a doubt the one of the greatest minds this world has ever seen. Who always speaks truth, facts, and logic NEVER hate as some shady figures claim.
@mshafiquk @MaajidNawaz Kings of liberty!!!! Love it!! All my favorite intellectuals in one photo. Hope to join you lot one day, I'm working on it.

@darlingjules @MyTeresadampier @realDonaldTrump Speaking of facts winning the popular vote doesnt make one popular, millions who voted for Clinton didn't vote for her, they only voted to vote against trump. Oh lets not forget libertarians and all other votes, so actually more people voted for anyone but Hillary than for her
@realDonaldTrump He is an incredible Supreme Court Justice and human being, a true patriotic American to his very core, and a man who fought for liberties and freedoms for decades in our sometimes unjust justice system. He is a true inspiration, and we are blessed as a nation to have him
Vive le Roi!!!
Pt.7 want to end trade wars and unfair trade practices.. End ALL tariffs for good, have free and open trade between all nations and promote a free market system. Let capitalism thrive. Corporatism is the issue not capitalism.
Pt 5. Want to see Americas education system thrive again and become the best in the world? Redirect the tens of billions in unneeded defense spending to education. How can you defend a nation anyways if everyone is poorly educated, education comes first, before all else.
Our nations military budget is around 750 BILLION. We added a increase in the tens of billions this year so large we could have paid for every single citzens healthcare and ended homelessness, and just used the increase wouldnt need to cut the current amount at all #healthcare
I love my #Democrat friends and their compassion, but they fail to understand that the very cultures they are importing which will one day be majorities due to birthrates are extremely religious and conservative. #Liberalism will DIE, and It will be their fault. #immigration
Supporting illegal immigration is a slap in the face to people like my good friend Adarvan a Zoroastrian from Iran who's family was slaughtered for their faith, who worked and waited for years to lawfully come to the US. #Illegalimmigration #immigration
If we reach a point in this country where there is no consequences for #Illegalimmigration our nation as we know it will die. If you forfeit sovereignty you're no longer a nation at all. A borderless world is a unrealistic fantasy/delusion and a  dangerous one. #openborders
#democrats and #republicans in DC support illegal immigration because of #1 Cheap labor (can pay below minimum wage, bypass labor laws, evade taxes) and #2 Building a future voting block. This is why they oppose common sense voter ID laws.
According to the #WashingtonPost the #Obama administration placed immigrant children with traffickers (including sex traffickers) and child laborers. Where is the outrage #democrats #buzzfeed #occupydemocrats #Cnn #Abcnews #foxnews #MSNBC #Progressive #ChildrenInCages
Thanks to #President #Clinton countless thousands if not millions of children have grown up WITHOUT one or more of their parents, the three strike law has ripped children away from their parents, heartless, and many non violent drug offenders or tax evaders, victimless crimes!!
When American parents make bad decisions their children are taken from them and subjected to horrors In our broken foster care system. Think politicans/the media/celebrities care about them? A tiny few but most dont give a damn!! So they have NO right lecturing anyone!!
I have a heart full of sympathy for these children brought here illegally by their parents, it is NOT their fault. The fault is with #1 THE PARENTS #2 Polticans,Celebs,Public figures who encourage illegal immigration #3 US immigration policy that strips away middle classes abroad
Someone tell me do Illegal immigrants men in the US have to pay child support if they abandon their children? NO? So they risk no fines or jail time for failure to pay child support? And noone talks about this... #childsupport #IllegalImmigration
I predict in the next 10-20 years we will see a real tyranny arise in the United states, and it will use our liberties and freedoms to rise and work against us. And whomever they may be will likely use war, terrorism, or a recession to rise up. We must protect ourselves #Tyranny
All words all symbols and all flags hold only the power and stigma we allow them. If we become a society that is so weak we get emotional over statues and flags then we are doomed. We can take back the power without banning things. Change the stigma reclaim power!!
I was raised to see people as Individuals and not groups, to judge the content of character and not skin or gender or class or sexuality. This is one of many reasons why I fight political tribalism, we should never be judged by those factors.
One of my many goals in life is to fight against tribalism and group think in America. And fight identity politics. In many areas of California political elections have come down to voting based on race..latino/Hispanic and Asain. We see this In other nations it is a true danger
Racism/Racist these once were powerful words, and they need that power so they can be used to fight racism..but too many have abused these words and that strips the power away and while they think they are helping the cause, truth is they are making it worse #racism #racist
There is no anti war political party in America, only complicity #Republicans #democrats
@PrisonPlanet #Trump full titles and style https://t.co/k6ZLEK3XiX
@Rambobiggs 7 or 8?
@billmaher I used to have a lot of respect for you, you’re one of the only liberals left, but you made it obvious that you would see this country burn to the ground just to get Trump out of office, all because he sued you and you have a personal vendetta...#Trump #billmaher shame
I try my best to get my #democrat and #republican friends to step back once in a while and look at themselves, a lot of times they look like bickering children, they always feel the need to attack the other and get a rush doing it. It is ridiculous
I predict in the next 5-10 years we will see civil war break out in France and Germany. Possibly other euro nations as well. And what is so sad is it could be prevented...
The German government says it is "discriminatory" to report on the ethnicity/race/religion of RAPIST and other sex criminals. But they only do something about it if the sex offender is not a German native or white, they dont care if its reported then. Isn't that #discrimination
The #German government is more authoritarian today then it has been since the days of the national socialist German workers party aka nazis. They regularly censor speech to cover for themselves, they have punished media that reports ethnicity and other facts about sex criminals.
Life gains its meaning by being finite, it is the urgency that fuels us...if we were immortal there would be no point no reason to get out of bed and life wouldn't be precious..it is precious because we aren't promised another breath of it. #life #wisdom
I do fear that Americans have forgotten that freedom OF and FROM religion are equally and absolutely essential
@sxy60 @CNN You're a bigot
@CNN Good
@siddie_style @CNN What do you know about his background...nothing
@siddie_style @CNN Try cutting the word "privilege" out of your vocabulary it is so overused by progressives it is burnt out and has losted meaning and power
@NoahHerschberg @foxandfriends Now have a wonderful life, I wont continue a discussion with someone who gets their account suspended for joking about someone dying, that is sick. Goodbye and good luck
@NoahHerschberg @foxandfriends Clearly you're a Marxist. Am I right? Because it is pretty obvious
@NoahHerschberg @foxandfriends Oh I took more than 4 years, 6 actually
@Flygirl69691 @CNN Try telling my latin and black exes (6 of them) how I'm a racist, see how far that gets you.
@Flygirl69691 @CNN Try educating yourself, maybe then you'd know the difference between someone BEING a racist and someone saying something racist and apologizing which is 99% of the population at some point in their lifetimes, and that includes every race, even YOU. I'd bet you have.. go ahead lie
@Flygirl69691 @CNN And unlike you I dont hide my face:-)
@Flygirl69691 @CNN P.S. vulgarity is no substitute for wit
@Flygirl69691 @CNN My career is doing wonderfully thank you. And Roseanne isn't a racist she is a Jewish woman who has colored family members who happened to make one tasteless offensive joke that does NOT make her a racist, racist have hateful intent and believe in racial superiority/inferiority
@Flygirl69691 @CNN Still upset? Still talking?  I dont care, get a life
@HaleighNiece @CNN For example Ted Bundy once saved a drowning girl
@HaleighNiece @CNN And since you like to make assumptions I'm not implying that this man in particular could be a rapist or murderer who has helped people I was making a point to prove that one act doesnt always define ones character
@HaleighNiece @CNN And in my first comment I said what he did was brave and heroic. I've never said it wasnt. But I'll never support passing out citizenship based on character alone. Character should be one of many factors.
@HaleighNiece @CNN No you assumed. And I dont agree, a country shouldn't select citzens soely based on character. Why? Because we never peoples true character, definitely not based on one act. There have been killers and rapist that have ironically saved lives, fact check it. It's TRUE
@flinky478 @akrasimykee @CNN Yes how dare I have opinions or views or a massive amount of education and experience in media and politics. You'll never shut me up, so you are the one who needs to move on. Have a wonderful day
@MiddleClazzMom @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump I dont think he is that pessimistic
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Amen to that, Gowdy would make an excellent AG. Should have been Trumps first choice
Lesson for all, No matter our opinions or how much we oppose our elected officials, we should admit when they do good. #RightToTry  #Trump https://t.co/km8q8eGHlJ
#republicans I'm not letting you off the hook..you have played the same game and attacked free speech, I can name examples..Kathy Griffin, NFL players, Madonna and  others. Truly supporting freespeech doesnt mean you support the content of speech you support the RIGHT to it!!
So Jimmy Kimmel can make xenophobic remarks about the first lady, keeps show. Bill Maher can call himself "house n*gga" keeps show. Whoopie Golberg can compare The president to Al Qaeda and Joy Behar makes bigoted remarks towards Christian's, they keep their show. #Roseanne NOPE
If there were no creator, the universe wouldn't have an age it would be infinite
It takes more faith to beleive there is no God, than to believe there is one
@NoahHerschberg @foxandfriends Clearly you havent taken economics
@flinky478 @akrasimykee @CNN I said it was only because he was a migrant because that is true. Brave people save others and risk their lives all the time. But they dont get awards of this magnitude nor are they reported on. CNN is reporting on it because it.suits their agenda. It sends a message
@flinky478 @akrasimykee @CNN Yes I do believe noone should expect to be rewarded, I'm NOT saying he expected it, but now others will and if they dont get it that wouldn't be fair. The only other issue I have is the motives of the Gov and media.
@siddie_style @CNN Fire fighting takes courage but also  experience and education. I'm fine with him accepting the rewards, my only issue is with the true motives of the gov and media. And going forward will everyone who does similar be rewarded the same.
@AirCoker @CNN I would have, I have saved lives before even risked my own in doing so. And if offered a reward I wouldnt want it but it is fine if he accepts. My issue is with the motives of the Gov and media and what precedent they set
@HaleighNiece @CNN I NEVER said he expected it. And the nation should value acts of courage, I just dont agree that all acts of courage should immediately be rewarded with citizenship and jobs, because it wouldn't be fair to others
@aM_tomiDe @CNN I called what he did brave and heroic from the get go. My first comment. Yet you're acting like I'm insulting him and I'm not
@johnjoelakers @CNN Nope not racist once so ever, try saying I'm racist to all my black and latino exes and friends and family members, see how well it works out. And I honestly dont care what you call me when there is NO truth to it
@Flygirl69691 @CNN You're a racist I dont want your support and attacking my looks also shows that you're immature, childish, and lowlife
@CNN I have NO issue with this man. Ive called what he did brave and heroic.  Im questioning the motives of the French Gov. And the media in covering this story. I dont think their motives are pure, I suspect an agenda. 	There is NOTHING wrong with asking questions + having an opinion
@flinky478 @akrasimykee @CNN I'm not mad at this man once so ever, I've never spoken badly of him. I'm questioning the motives of the French government and the media. And I see absolutely nothing wrong with that once so ever. And I shouldn't be attacked for it.
@flinky478 @akrasimykee @CNN I know migrants personally I dated one. One who was subjected to horrific violence in Syria, they once jumped into water and saved a child. Should that warrant free citizenship and a job, my ? Is will this be a regular thing
@flinky478 @akrasimykee @CNN I'm saying CNN is only covering it because he is migrant and that is true. And French citzens aren't rewarded this way either.
@flinky478 @akrasimykee @CNN I'm also part French and I know why they did this and it wasnt out of kindness they have an agenda a message to send and that is the wrong reason
@flinky478 @akrasimykee @CNN Yes and noone should expect an award for helping but I never once said that he did, I'm saying others may after this. I said what he did was brave and heroic. But I will never agree that handing out free citizenship is a good idea no matter the cause
@NoahHerschberg @foxandfriends I'm not going to debate this on Twitter where characters are limited. Feel free to add me on Facebook and we can do a split screen live debate. If not fine, have a wonderful life.
@ElQuesos1 @CNN I never once said that all terror attacks are by muslims, never never never. Can you not read? There are many non muslims who have committed terror atrocities but the majority of attacks have been carried out by muslims. That is FACT not opinion
"In the matter of monogamy, do you go against nature for the sake of love...or go with nature for the sake of pleasure..."-Christopher Foster
@THR Funny how TV shows can make anti semitic jokes, anti white jokes with impunity. Clearly they aren't against ALL racism.
@THR Leftist dont know the difference between a racist (very small % of the pop.) And people who say racist things in their life but who dont harbor hate or a belief in racial superiority/inferiority, which is 99% of the population.
@THR Channing Dungey just created a massive number of new trump voters, securing his reelection
@THR Oh let's be REAL here the joke was ugly but a JOKE, and had she said the exact same thing about someone is the Trump administration the left would be singing her praises. That is the damned truth
@ABCNetwork  Shame on you
There exist major differences between normal muslims who dont seek to harm or force their faith on anyone and Islamist who are muslims who beleive in and push for the spread of political and legal Islam. #islam #islamist vs #muslims make the distinction
@ElQuesos1 @CNN There have been thousands of Islamic terror attacks world wide since 911
@flinky478 @akrasimykee @CNN Yes in my opinion, and my opinion is correct
@NoahHerschberg @foxandfriends Generational wealth should exist, tell me would you forfeit your home, possessions, and all forms of wealth to the government or are you going to pass it to family/loved ones
@NoahHerschberg @foxandfriends And secondly, according to many economists and historians the generational wealth amassed from slavery is gone In most cases
@NoahHerschberg @foxandfriends For one Twitter doesn't allow me enough characters to FULLY address the entire issue
@flinky478 @akrasimykee @CNN The media is using this to push a narrative
@flinky478 @akrasimykee @CNN It just isn't fair to hand out citizenship to one heroic person but not others who have done the same, and it sends a message
@flinky478 @akrasimykee @CNN You're making loaded ignorant assumptions as if you know what I'm thinking or my full opinion on the matter. You have missed my entire point. And I said to start with that what he did was brave and heroic
@aM_tomiDe @CNN Never said it makes him less heroic, what is with the ignorant assumptions? My point is In exposing the fact that the media covers postive stories about migrants to push an agenda and ignores negative stories to protect that agenda. If they had no agenda they'd cover both sides
@aM_tomiDe @CNN A friend of mine was raped by 3 migrants and severely beaten, the media didn't give it a min of coverage...I wonder why... And because they were illegal migrants and hard to trace they will likely never face justice. Do you even care?
@aM_tomiDe @CNN It is propaganda if he wasnt a migrant this wouldnt be reported on and there would be no rewards that's the damn truth.
@aM_tomiDe @CNN No he doesn't. Why should he get it but not others who have saved lives?
@akrasimykee @CNN And by reporting on this alot of migrants are going to expect the same, why wouldnt they
@akrasimykee @CNN When French citizens risk their lives to save others there is often NO media coverage. That is a fact, he is only getting coverage because he is a migrant
@akrasimykee @CNN No I never said that, you're missing the whole point. People save lives all the time do they get handed jobs and citizenships for it? And how is it fair to other migrants who have helped save people for him to get a free pass but not them.. hmmm
@CNN CNN is a political entity, they aren't posting this story as news, but because it promotes democratic party views on migrants, it's a positive story. They havent reported anything on recent migrant crimes, from rape to acid attacks.
@CNN What he did was brave and heroic, but awarding a migrant with free citizenship and a public service job is overboard. We should expect nothing for helping others
@washingtonpost We need far harsher punishments and sentences for sex crimes. We should consider castration and the death penalty. And we need far harsher punishments for those who knowingly lie about being victims of sex crimes for attention or to destroy a person or whatever their motive.
@YoungDems4Trump The MSM rather Trump fail and Americans get hurt than him succeeding
@2AFightA He knows damn well that is a lie
@RitaPanahi @StevePriceMedia @2GB873 @3AW693 @NewsTalk4BC We need far harsher sentences for rapist, and consider castration
@foxandfriends I was very close to a 85 year old black American woman from Mississippi, she passed not long ago. She lived through Jim Crow and was raped and beaten and lost loved ones, she thought the idea of reparations was wrong for many reasons. Why does this young generation feel entitled?
@foxandfriends I will pay reparations when every decentant of African on African slavery pays, every Islamic slave trade decendant, every native American who belonged to the few tribes who owned slaves pays, and when east asian slavery decendants pay..
@foxandfriends I always ask believers in reparations how would they feel if we did pay reparations but only to black citizens who lived through the Jim Crow era, noone born after 64 gets them. That's the one condition, this always sends them into a frenzy and exposes their true feelings. Try it
@foxandfriends I've come to learn through extensive research and experience that almost everyone who believes In reparations tends to be historically ignorant/uneducated or they harbor hate and racism themself.
Always listen more than you talk #wisdom
One major reason behind Americas division and discourse is that people are taking politics TOO personally. If you a oppose a view they hold they take it as a personal attack even when it isn't at all. Opposition to your viewpoints isn't opposition to your identity. #Politics #USA
#Republicans are becoming far too jaded, Pres. #Trump supporters often refuse to admit his flaws, get triggered when other Republicans call them out, and are so blinded by personal bias. It is a true cult of personality, and that is in part due to Trumps celebrity. OpenyourEYES!

@johnlegend Victimhood is not passed down in our blood neither is guilt
@johnlegend Slavery is one of humanities most evil acts. It should never be weaponized and used to attack people yet that is exactly what you're doing
@johnlegend Funny considering Trumps family didn't immigrate to America until the 19th and 20th centuries...LONG after slavery in America ended
We are at a dangerous point in America because the #democrats &amp; #republicans expect conformity. If you're a repub who is pro Choice they bash you and push you away if you're a dem who is against illegal immigration they bash you and push you away. Conformity is sick and dangerous
Diversity of thought and opinion is the most important form of diversity of all. Yet so many on the left who claim to love diversity will bash you and try and destroy you if you do not agree with them on every issue...So how do we fix this..where do we start...#diversity
I dont care if you're a #Democrat or #Republican , if you're a good person I will respect you. It doesn't matter how different your views are from mine I'm not going to see you as a bad person for holding different views, my life has been enriched with people of all views.
@soonerZed370 @HumanistReport It is an accurate statement, it isn't my job to educate you and do your research for you
Millions upon millions of Americans don't really know who they are. Most of their thoughts and values aren't their own, they are the product of years of media, cultural &amp; societal ideas+ values pumped into peoples consciousness. Unplug people find yourself #slaves #technology
@soonerZed370 @HumanistReport DNC 2016 FULL length detailed party platform
@soonerZed370 @HumanistReport Ask Hillary
@soonerZed370 @HumanistReport And the modern leftist logic around abortions ignores advancements in Medicine that have proved human fetuses (Latin word for baby) are far more than a lump of cells, they can feel and respond to pain at 21 weeks. Roe V wade would have ruled very differently today
@soonerZed370 @HumanistReport The actual Democratic platform since 2016 has supported late term abortions.
@HumanistReport Actually Humanist report (by that name you clearly dont understand irony) it is your logic and ignorant assumptions that are twisted. I suggest reading up on modern science and medical research on abortions.

@solomonraymusic @mathewrodriguez @TheVixensworld Oh I have the chops and then some. But keep on judging me based on my extieror keep ignorantly assuming. Just like you assume I'm 100% white right. I have vitiligo jackass
@solomonraymusic @mathewrodriguez @TheVixensworld Yes let the convo die typical leftist tactic "only my voice matters" shut everyone else down. Hopefully the hate your heart harbors and the ignorance will one day die, good luck have a wonderful life. You need it clearly.
@solomonraymusic @mathewrodriguez @TheVixensworld And I never said having a black president negates racism, it negates the lie that black people in America hold no power and that power is exculsely in white hands
@solomonraymusic @mathewrodriguez @TheVixensworld You dont know a damn thing about my ancestors. My ancestors never owned slaves. For all you know yours may have.
@solomonraymusic @mathewrodriguez @TheVixensworld Racism is the belief that a race is supieor or Inferior to another. To demonize one race only for a crime all have committed is racist.
@solomonraymusic @mathewrodriguez @TheVixensworld An estimated 46 million people are enslaved in the world today, in parts of Africa, Asia and the middle east. But you chose to point fingers at a past that's already written the ink is dry. Are you prepared to condemn Africans who own slaves? Let's hear it
@solomonraymusic @mathewrodriguez @TheVixensworld Thanks for displaying your massive historical ignorance. Racism and slavery pre date white Europeans by thousands of years. You piss on the memory of all those enslaved throughout time with your ignorance of their existence
True leaders dont seek followers...they seek to bring out the leaders in others
All races are equal none are superior or inferior to another. All cultures However are not equal. And conversely the belief that they are is dangerous. Some cultures thrive together others die together #culture #race #truth
Claiming victimhood for crimes done to one's ancestors and feeling self righteousness for it is to dishonor and demean their memory. No one is a victim of crimes or atrocities they never went through, period. #victim #victimculture #slavery #racism
@PahlaviReza The people of Iran need leadership that has their best interest. That will protect and serve them, the people of Iran need Reza Pahlavi, #SHAH !!!
Thankfully the Iranian deal was crushed, now it is time to encourage the brave people of #Iran to revolt against their oppressive murderous Islamic regime #irandeal
@BarackObama Pres.Obama why make a deal that would Intrust Iran to inspect themselves...? And give several weeks notice for other inspections? Iran is an enemy, not the Iranian people, Iran's Islamic murderous regime is... #iran #IranDeal #obama #trump
@BarackObama Pres.Obama if you cared so much for the Iran deal why did you not submit it to Congress as a binding treaty, we know you know the laws of this nation, so why?
@BarackObama If the Iranian nuclear deal benefits the US and not Iran why are they so upset over the repel...?? If it truly prevented them from getting a nuke they would be pleased now not furious. The Islamist regime shall fall long live Reza Shah
@solomonraymusic @mathewrodriguez @TheVixensworld I guess you have forgotten America had a black president for 8 years...yup no power at all right?
@solomonraymusic @mathewrodriguez @TheVixensworld Clearly you don't understand what racism is, you probably believe POC can't be racist, if that is the case you're ignorant. Educate yourself
Without shared values mass migration leads to segregation, discrimination, division and blood soaked streets...This is already happening in Europe and America, the US takes in 1 MILLION immigrants annually, and we destabilize the world in doing so and people suffer..#IMMIGRATION
Whether you love #Trump or hate him you have to admit that he is a madman lol
#Politicalcorrectness is authoritarian in nature, and is essentially the intolerance of thoughts and opinions, it should never be mistaken for manners or kindness even when being paraded as such
The swiftest course towards destroying any great nation is to destroy the peoples sense of history. Americans are sadly extremely uneducated in regards to American and world history, we need to inject a sense of interest and pride in historical knowledge
@Randybarbato Trumps used to drag queens just ask Rudy Gulliani
@Randybarbato Trump has attended Same sex weddings (Elton John's and others) I doubt he will get all bothered by a crowd of drag queens...maybe HOT and bothered lol
@thelittleidiot @Randybarbato @realDonaldTrump Many of the Trump indictments are not even related to Russian collusion, and The FBI has cleared general Flynn. Pesky facts I know
@thelittleidiot @Randybarbato @realDonaldTrump Dear Mr.Delusional, The Republican party will always be the party of Lincoln, Eisenhower, Reagan and T.Roosevelt. It predates Trump and it will live on long after him. The Democratic party supported slavery and Jim crow should we judge our parties by their darkest hours or finest
@MichaelAvenatti The public isn't stupid we know stormy and trump had sexual relations, but we also know stormy has contradicted her own story and did not take proper action when allegedly threatened years ago, and she broke a contract that she accepted and accepted payment for. Case closed
@MichaelAvenatti Why would anyone going forward hire or work with you Mr.Avenatti when you have proven over and over that you dont give a damn about attorney client privilege
@MichaelAvenatti LOL this is so pathetic. Of all the things that could bring PRESIDENT Trump down this stormy daniels fiasco is damn sure not one of them, but by all means keep dreaming just hurry and cash in the 15mins is nearly over the media is moving on !!!
@mathewrodriguez @TheVixensworld Way to generalize and demonize an entire race for a collective "crime" millions of them dont commit. You're the real racist. Lecturing and or demonizing any race including whites will get you nowhere and makes YOU complicit in our divisions
Our society's number one issue is conformity
If you're able to control language you're able to control the people. That is the main reason why I oppose political correctness. I'm a free speech fundamentalist

@TwitterMoments Slavery is still alive and well in parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Why no outrage over that?? Hmm I wonder...It is a sad day when a few words spoken by a rapper outrage people more than modern day slavery.
@VanLathan @cthagod TMZ has damaged and hurt many black artist over the years, including Michael Jackson. They have NO room to stand on a cold moral high ground
@VanLathan @cthagod Tell me Van, are POC who’s ancestors owned slaves equally as guilty as whites who’s ancestors did...Because demonizing one race for a evil all races have committed (some still do FYI) is truly racist. I’ve never heard you once adress the Islamic slave trade or African slave trade
@VanLathan @cthagod Van clearly opposes diversity of thought and opinion, he clearly believes all POC must think alike.
@Chloe_Hilliard @VanLathan What is so extremely racist is that you leftist think all POC must conform to your views and opinions, they second they step out of line you bash them and spew hate. It is sickening and you’re going to be exposed for it.
@Chloe_Hilliard @VanLathan Chloe, what diversity?? Clearly TMZs entire Staff is full of leftist. Diversity of thought and opinion is the most important form of diversity of all, and clearly Van and you oppose that diversity.
@ShaunKing @TMZ TMZ has exploited and hurt many black artist, they have NO right to claim any sort of moral high ground
@ShaunKing @TMZ Kanye’s right to hold his own views and opinions are being met with reckless hate by leftist, they absolutely HATE when POC don’t conform and fall in line. Their hate must be fought against and challenged to the uttermost
@ShaunKing @TMZ Shaun King and people with his mindset Believe that all POC should conform to their views and ideologies, and bash those who don’t. They oppose the most important form of diversity..diversity of thought and opinion.
@ShaunKing @TMZ I would absolutely LOVE to debate Van on history, because I’m extremely educated in that field and I can always spot someone who is not, and he clearly isn’t. I can also spot ignorant racism a mile away.
@ShaunKing @TMZ I dare Shaun to answer one question, are people of color who’s ancestors owned slaves equally as guilty as whites who’s ancestors owned slaves? But I bet he is too cowardly to answer
@ShaunKing @TMZ Here is the real truth, NOONE is a victim of crimes committed against their ancestors and NOONE is guilty for crimes committed by their ancestors. We are INDIVIDUALS, and shall be judged as such. Shaun and BLM want to judge everyone based on color not character,which is dangerous
@ShaunKing @TMZ BLM/Shaun hold the view that we are to judge people on the basis of skin color &amp; ignore historical facts, their view is simple, if youre born white your born guilty of all crimes committed by any whites but if youre not born white your innocent even if your ancestors owned slaves
@ShaunKing @TMZ Shaun King is a racist, why? Because he chooses to demonize 1  race collectively for crimes (like slavery, oppression) ALL races have done at one point or another in history, some still do. ALL slavery/oppression/genocide is evil, but you won’t hear King place blame on it all
@ShaunKing @TMZ I dare and challenge Shaun King to speak up about the irrefutable historical fact that both Native American and African tribes kept and owned slaves, And to address the 1,000+ year long Islamic slave trade. And lastly, address the fact that slavery still exist in parts of Africa
@Alig_Aligula HaPpY BirThDaY!!!
We are all beautiful individuals we can’t let  #politicians and #celebs and #media divide us into groups, tribal politics are evil and dangerous. Love each other as unique individuals and stop labeling. We are a beautiful diverse species, but the mind and heart are everything!!
@kanyewest political correctness is America’s newest form of intolerance, it is particularly dangerous because it parades itself around as tolerance..PC is the silencing of thought and opinion for the sake of comfort for others,it is manifestation of evil authority and dictation
@kanyewest the way to defeat evil ideologies is by allowing them to be in the open, that way love can be injected...love can cure all hate and crush all evil
@kanyewest the greatest thing that divides us is the shackles and chains of conformity, conformity enslaves independent and free thought. We have to break free by allowing all thoughts and opinions to manifest and be in the open...
@kanyewest Diversity of thought and opinion are the greatest forms of diversity there is, because it effects us all...It is the very foundation of WHO WE ARE...when rallied against people are unknowingly preventing people from being their true selfs..they cage our beings
@kanyewest Hate is a reflection of a persons lack of love for ones self, Deep down those who direct hate outwards are doing so out of that lack of love inside, learning to love yourself is the greatest gift of all-Whitney Houston was right...If you cant love yourself how can you love others
@kanyewest  art is always the question...art is never an answer
My cat was once a stray, while I once thought I was making her life better by taking her in I now realize she has made mine better. I love my #cat

Americans need to embrace the most important diversity of all..diversity of thought and opinion. I can’t think of a more dull world than one where we all think alike We don’t have to agree with each other to respect, love and listen to one another. #Americans #Diversity #politics
President #Trump has an amazing opportunity to change and really reach out to communities who feel pushed away, he doesn’t need to be PC he needs to be compassionate, and remember he has to represent ALL Americans. We make peace with enemies not friends.
I support classical liberalism, I was a staunch #Democrat the majority of my life..The party left me + millions of others we didn’t leave it. By betraying real liberal values, like individualism, free speech, free thought, and more. And the embracing of #Marxism is most atrocious
@RichardGrenell  Congrats, now please use your position to bring positive changes to our complicated relationship with #Deutschland #SaveGermany
It is time we the sane half of this country hold these #democrats and #republicans feet to the fire and remind them who their real boss is...US...The PEOPLE...remind them we can UNSEAT them as easily as we seat them!

TONS of republicans who are in the party R trying to bring change on issues like #LGBTrights and bring the party up to speed, yet they get so much hate from the #LGBTcommunity shouldn’t we want BOTH parties to support LGBT rights? Or are we that stupid that we would hate on that
@Rupaul I love #LGBT Americans, but I will NEVER understand how a people who know what it is like to be thrown aside for being themselves and rejected by loved ones, can turn around and do the same to LGBT republicans/libertarians. Shame on all who push hate in ANY direction!!
Our Constitution gives we the people of these United States the power to replace our government when it becomes tyrannical and corrupt, let’s remind them #Senators #President #Cnn #Foxnews #Democrats #Republicans

@LES_Shipper78 @FetShibe @Weezers_Revenge @kanyewest Do you realize how ridiculous you sound?
@kanyewest  watching Democrats/The media demonize Kanye has their true racist colors exposed. They OPPOSE the most important form of diversity, diversity of thought...They expect black Americans to think their way and their way only, to conform, it is sick. #Kanyewest #cnn #msnbc
@kanyewest Never an answer, always a question
I believe in the country America used to be...the country America is and the country America will become..Because even in our darkest hours countless citizens will always stand for righteousness and justice and hope...I love you #America #USA #USAPROUD #Americanpride
One thing that eats at me is the feeling of knowing that no one truly knows me, and feeling like I can’t truly tell anyone around me, family or friends...I feel like they don’t even want to know and maybe it is because they think they already do...
If you are willing to stand in my light but not in my shadow you can’t have a place in my life..in our darkest hours we must look around us to see who is left standing, those are the people who really love and care for you. Let everyone else go...
One of the most true and profound things I’ve learned in life is that we all want to be seen...to be noticed...we want to know that others know we are here...And that is why I’ll never intentionally ignore anyone, I will not use it as a weapon to cause pain.

If you believe critics of your faith need to be silenced or fought against or criminalized then that shows how little faith in your faith you truly have
People who believe that critics of religion, culture, political policies, and so on should be silenced/criminalized aren’t strong, they are as WEAK as can be. Strong people welcome criticism and don’t cower away, period. #FreeSpeech #islam
NO, Free speech no longer exist in the UK. Which sadly will be their downfall if things don’t change. Free speech is the very foundation of western civilization. NO nation that will LOCK you up for criticizing Islam (religion NOT a race) can claim to have free speech. #freespeech

@JenNongel @Hoosiers1986 I wouldn’t give him all the credit but his tough stance has helped
@Real_Gaz @Hoosiers1986 I think people shouldn’t go after these kids but the adults who are behind them USING them as both sword and shield. However Hogg said he wants Cruz to get the death penalty so the media will continue to talk. That made me sick to hear
@_ROB_29 @Hoosiers1986 @FBI The reason why she isn’t is clear, the democrats and neocons worked for years to gain political control over institutions that could hold them accountable. They don’t need to cover up crimes when they fill top positions with establishment loyalist
@Nigel_Farage True leaders don’t seek followers but seek to inspire the leaders inside of every day people and that is exactly what Nigel Farage has done. Keep up the good work chap, salute!
@MarkDice It is disgraceful for a former director of the FBI to act the way he is...It degrades the institution. He LOVES the media spotlight and he seems to be obsessed with Trump. It is really creepy when you think about it

@NoraMulready Pictures speak louder than words
@NoraMulready If you’ve condemned Islamist governments and norms then tell me what is wrong with Katie doing the same? ?
@NoraMulready Talking isn’t enough, but it is a start good for you. And Katie was NOT mocking anyone personally she was making a political statement, a needed one, you just are so stuck in your view that you can’t see what it truly is.
@pinkk9lover @Hoosiers1986 @junogsp5 @RuthieRedSox @ROCKONOHIO @AppSame @John_KissMyBot2 @LVNancy @buzzman888 @Jamierodr10 @gr8tjude Notice they want to lower ONLY the voting age but not the drinking age or anything else. That speaks volumes because if they believe 16/17 year olds are responsible enough to vote than aren’t they responsible enough for everything else. Hypocrites
RT @Lauren_Southern: While @realDonaldTrump strikes Syria he also strikes off non-intervention from his campaign promises. 😒
@NoraMulready I challenge you to call out the Islamic based legal systems ran by MEN in nations like Saudi Arabia and Iran...bet you won’t...But I hope you would chose to stand with women against oppressive clothing instead of bashing a fellow woman for doing so
@NoraMulready If you’re more offended by Katie’s post than you are the fact that an oppressive religious system in the 21st century FORCES millions of women to hide themselves and cover all that is NATURAL and beautiful then you need to take a long look in the mirror and rethink everything!
@NoraMulready Maybe if more people were brave enough to show the world that burqas are oppressive and ridiculous like Katie has, then women wouldn’t be FORCED to wear them anymore
@NoraMulready The ONLY vile thing is people like U who R more offended by someone making a political point about burqas than you are the FACT that millions of women are FORCED to wear them, U need a injection of reality/real morals So far you’re opposing her free speech+supporting oppression
@NoraMulready Keywords “women who are FORCED to wear the burqa” doesn’t sound pro woman or liberal to me once so ever. Traitor

@loondale I agree with you on that, but I also don't think American tax payers should have to pay to deport them.
@loondale @mscallihan1 Yes Michael there was, which actually put the kids who came in danger but the media was hush hush about that. Some even died because of it
@mscallihan1 @loondale I oppose them voting while illegal, but once legalized they have every right to vote. I think we need to restrict immigration # but not stop
@loondale I say we give them a time limit to legalize or leave. And make it clear the help only goes to those who have been here long term
@loondale I had the same stance but my view changed, we can't punish children for the actions of their parents Imagine doing that with any other crime

@mscallihan1 @loondale Yes which is why any legalization must only be provided to those who can prove they have been here long term and no new unlawful immigration
@loondale That is why we should secure our borders first fast track legalization of dreamers here for number of years,NO more unlawful imm. Afterwards
@UniteAlbertans That is true, most trump supporters just want them to gain citizenship/legalize while having security and order, not deport them.
We can have both compassion and help others while also having law and order and security. We need immigration reformed to do both. #DACA
Secure border legalize ALL #dreamers via fast track program, all new immigration must be lawful We need real reform and restored order #DACA
Saving money is not always wise, you must invest and take risk to climb the ladder of wealth and opportunity...Save only for security
The key to true wealth is, GENERATING money, the best way to generate is to accept help while being your own boss at the same time...
I will always dare to be different..I will color outside of the lines..and I will never allow my mind to be placed in the box of conformity
"Normal" is just another word for lifeless...I embrace my weirdness...my strange ways...That makes me unique and I stand out from the pack.
My heart is in a constant state of conflict, with itself.

@JedediahBila I'm not a big fan a of the president, and I can't stand this shit. They also don't realize when they do this they create more trump voters
@washingtonpost  https://t.co/0N1ulZpnsl
@washingtonpost The media is complicit in the empowerment of the ever growing far left and far right
@washingtonpost While Antifa terrorist claim to not be democrats, make NO mistake they are embraced by democrats. And Dems won't condemn their violence
@washingtonpost The fascist of the future will call themselves the anti fascist
@OLAASM @beth_project8 @washingtonpost LIE
@washingtonpost We are coming for you Antifa, you will be labeled a domestic terrorist organization (exactly what you are) VERY SOON
@washingtonpost Finally admitting reality WP? These attacks have been going on for YEARS, but they can no longer be ignored.
@BernieSanders Why won't you say a word about the 46 million enslaved TODAY in parts of Africa Asia and the Middle East ?
@BernieSanders The left and right and media are empowering hate groups by giving them the attention they want and all the publicity
@BernieSanders I agree with you sanders, but I bet you'll never ever say the same about Islamic supremacist/terrorist, no matter how many bodies pile up
@BernieSanders These same white supremacist were active during the obama years, why didn't the left say anything then!? They ignored it!
@BernieSanders Why didn't you condemn them during obamas terms? They were just as active then , only the media didn't report on it the same.
@BernieSanders Hitler was a socialist
@BernieSanders Communist states never call themselves communist, they use the cloak of socialism. Like Vietnam, china, and former USSR (1 S 4 socialism)
@BernieSanders communist movement is massive in comparison to hate groups, 100 mIllion have died from communism, more than nazism. Condemn both I dare you
@BernieSanders There is an estimated 6,000 of them. They can be beaten easily, we should fear the the politicians left and right who have killed millions
We cannot continue to allow #Democrats &amp; #republicans to rip this country apart. We need to fix the parties and empower other parties
One day I'm running for president, and it will be the first #democrat #republican ticket to win. We need to bring everyone together.
@RoseMarieoolala @chattykathykb1 @nickiknowsnada @Inspire_Us @realDonaldTrump This is why there is so much hate for him, the absolute lies people have bought into the the media/politicians told them to believe
@RoseMarieoolala @chattykathykb1 @nickiknowsnada @Inspire_Us @realDonaldTrump He NEVER said that, he never said "all people coming from Mexico" go educate yourself stop believing lies, listen to the FULL speech
@mjschumaker @TalbertSwan @Inspire_Us @realDonaldTrump Exactly!!!!!
@ClassicFillmore @TalbertSwan @Inspire_Us @realDonaldTrump Your ignorance make me sick, but Forgiven, it is "Bishop" swan taking funds from despots. But I bet you praise him.
@Shut_the_fridge @TalbertSwan @Inspire_Us @realDonaldTrump You must have her Mistaken for Bishop Swan, he is the one with his hand out lining the pockets of his expensive suits
@TalbertSwan @Inspire_Us @realDonaldTrump The "Bishop" has DEMONIZED 63 MILLION Americans while also having his hand out. God sees all Bishop. He knows what you've done as well
@TalbertSwan @Inspire_Us @realDonaldTrump That is a nice suit you got on Bishop, wonder how many donations that cost your followers
@TalbertSwan @Inspire_Us @realDonaldTrump "bishop" Swan is too cowardly to reply to our messages. He can dish it out but can't take it
@TalbertSwan @Inspire_Us @realDonaldTrump I have many issues with the president, but I would never lie and spew the kind of hate that you do, Period. I'm going to pray for you sir
@TalbertSwan @Inspire_Us @realDonaldTrump Your hate and your sins are hidden, but they won't be for long Mr.Swan. What is done in the dark always comes to light
@TalbertSwan @Inspire_Us @realDonaldTrump You're making FALSE claims, he has never said he hates any of those groups, and he does NOT support Nazis or KKK
@TalbertSwan @Inspire_Us @realDonaldTrump True Christians wouldn't harbor the hate and disgust that you have in your heart. You're showing that you're unforgiving and willing to lie
@TalbertSwan @Inspire_Us @realDonaldTrump I often disagree with the president, but you're flat out lying NOT very Christ like if you ask me.
@TalbertSwan @Inspire_Us @realDonaldTrump Let he who is without sin cast the 1st stone sir you're not without sin. The only difference is yours haven't been exposed to the public yet
@TalbertSwan @Inspire_Us @realDonaldTrump The one dishonoring her is you Swan, by believing she would be so unforgiving and judgmental as to take issue with trump sharing her message
@TalbertSwan @Inspire_Us @realDonaldTrump I think Mother Theresa would know we ALL sin and would be forgiving. Which is Christ like, which is the exact opposite of what you're doing
@TalbertSwan @Inspire_Us @realDonaldTrump Mother Theresa would have been forgiving of his comments, that is the Christ like thing to do, instead of being hateful as you are
@TalbertSwan @Inspire_Us @realDonaldTrump Your comments are astonishingly hateful, shouldn't you hope he learns from her wisdom? Why bash him for it? And you call yourself bishop?
@Inspire_Us @realDonaldTrump Shouldn't every American hope the POTUS learns from the wisdom of people like mother Teresa? Wouldn't you call that progress? Why the hate?
@Inspire_Us @realDonaldTrump The comments on here are astonishing, I never thought I'd see so much hate coming from the left, and to bash Mother Teresa? So sad

@NihadAwad @lsarsour She is direct violation of Division 80 of the Criminal Code Act 1995, and has been reported to the FBI and secret service
@NihadAwad @lsarsour If you stand with Linda you also stand with the Islamic state and Hamas and all other Islamic terror groups
@NihadAwad @lsarsour She is a cancer upon the world not a hero
@NihadAwad @lsarsour She is NO hero you absolute fool, she is a enemy, and I'm no right wing extremist, she is the extremist and she is the authoritarian
@lsarsour the #FBI should be investigating Linda Sarsour, for her ties to Islamic terror groups and the #secretservice for her threats

Those who look for love with their eyes shall never experience real love. And they don't deserve to. They can lie to themselves won't work
Real love is loving someone more than you've ever loved yourself &amp; getting the same in return. You'd die for that person and give everything
I refuse to be in any relationship with someone who is controlling/abusive/selfish/untrustworthy/unfaithful. Love&amp; those qualities dont mix

We came down from the Stars time to be reminded of who we are...What animates...stimulates...then we return that is our fate we set the date
