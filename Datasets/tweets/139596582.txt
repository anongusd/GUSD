Thank you to @jamie_daw for writing this piece - and making the case for a US multi-payer system more succinctly and persuasively than I have been able to.
"The diversity of health financing arrangements globally demonstrates that there are many possible paths to achieving universal health care at an affordable cost...Advocates and policymakers should pick carefully among these paths, choosing one that strikes a balance..."
"Americans have long valued choice and competition in their health care. The German model offers both: Patients choose private insurers that compete for enrollees, in the process driving innovation and improving quality."
"Under a German-style plan, states could still be given flexibility in regulating nonprofit insurers to reflect regional priorities, similar to the flexibility offered to states in managing Medicaid and the A.C.A. exchanges."
"Compared with the mostly fee-for-service, single-payer arrangements in Canada or Medicare, enrolling Americans in managed care plans paid on a per-patient basis would offer greater incentives to increase efficiency, improve quality of care and promote coordination of care."
"This model ensures that all citizens have access to affordable health care, but it also incorporates age-old American values of choice and private competition in health insurance."
"Germany offers a health insurance model that, like Canada‚Äôs, results in far less spending than in the US, while achieving universal, comprehensive coverage. The difference is that Germany‚Äôs is a multipayer model, which builds more naturally on the US insurance system."
A must-read: The U.S. should be looking to the German multi-payer healthcare system, not the Canadian single-payer system, as an example for reform. 	https://t.co/BY4u4AibCe

@LianaPatricia_ I just don‚Äôt think this is how you do that without hurting the neediest.
@LianaPatricia_ Eliminating the social safety net system we have today in order to provide lump sums to everyone I think doesn‚Äôt actually serve the neediest. That‚Äôs my overall point. I think targeted in better. 		Ik that creating a valuation system for non-traditional labor is important...
@LianaPatricia_ Right but UBI eliminates the transfers we have now. It would be giving middle and higher income people a raise and taking away benefits and the kind of hands on support that the current system offers from the neediest. 		Low income women would be getting less.
@LianaPatricia_ @ne0liberal @AndrewYangVFA And I think the role of social workers &amp; the more hands on safety net we have now is really important in connecting people with programs/job training/etc. And that needs to be part of the discussion.		Overall, I think giving someone a lump sum isn‚Äôt always the best answer
@LianaPatricia_ @ne0liberal @AndrewYangVFA But overall I think talking about transfers to non-traditional labor is vastly different because of the scale alone. 		Part of the argument is that although there are various programs in the social safety net today, having them all may actually add up to more $ for the neediest..
@LianaPatricia_ @ne0liberal @AndrewYangVFA I think this makes sense, &amp; the discussion of putting a value on other forms of labor is important but i think it‚Äôs also fairly different than what a UBI is.

@dafoe_jake @shannongkane @MelPruett_ That‚Äôs exactly why we have cost-controls. Come into my work and see the people who struggle with cost. They don‚Äôt need to be moved off of their insurance - they need actual prices to be lower. Which all payer rate setting would fix
‚ÄúCourage isn‚Äôt just standing by yourself on the senate floor giving a speech. Courage is whether you‚Äôll stand next to someone you don‚Äôt always agree with for the betterment of this country.‚Äù -@amyklobuchar
@dafoe_jake @shannongkane @MelPruett_ You should really check out all-payer rate setting as well. That's where the real cost controls come in. And you don't have to eliminate private insurance for that to happen. I think you'd be a fan.
@dafoe_jake @shannongkane @MelPruett_ And went to a hybrid
@dafoe_jake @shannongkane @MelPruett_ You have it reversed. "Go through all that" is what you have to do to get rid of an entire industry and uproot 150 million people. Public-private hybrids allow for options that people want while also providing for everyone. Which is why the Netherlands left strict single payer
@dafoe_jake @shannongkane @MelPruett_ You never get something for nothing. Resource constraints exist and money has to come from somewhere. Working and middle class people also would be paying higher taxes to finance M4A. Would it be less than the premiums they pay now? Maybe. But so could a public option.
@dafoe_jake @shannongkane @MelPruett_ "competing" here is wrong. It's a public plan so the rates could be set. It would compete by being a lower cost plan - which brings down prices for everyone as well. The CBO covered this in 2009 when the public option was floated for Obamacare
@dafoe_jake @shannongkane @MelPruett_ Whatever you think of this argument - its a big cost to move everyone off of the employer insurance they like and then eliminate an entire industry. Which is exactly why no other countries do it. Again ex: Germany, Canada (which has single payer)
@dafoe_jake @shannongkane @MelPruett_ So there's a few things here that are misleading. First, it would start on the exchanges but wouldn't end there. It could also be an opt-out public insurance that would cover anyone unless they chose otherwise. It would cover everyone.
@ne0liberal https://t.co/yiHzWu01bV
@MelPruett_ @dafoe_jake @shannongkane That‚Äôs not actually how it works. I want everyone to have a public option. I don‚Äôt want people to be forced off of their employer insurance if they want to keep it. 		Where did I ever say everyone shouldn‚Äôt have insurance?
@dafoe_jake @shannongkane @MelPruett_ So you can provide a public option to people who can‚Äôt afford private insurance. You claimed you have to eliminate private options - and that‚Äôs just wrong. Even Canadians use private supplements.

But if you want to come at her for this - be my guest. Her last far left opponent went all in on this smear and she beat him 57% - 34%.		She went on to win the general election by a larger margin than anyone who‚Äôs run for R.I. Gov in 26 years.
Raimondo took her reforms to the people through a series of town halls and ultimately persuaded 90% the state legislature to pass the reforms. Everyone understood the crisis. That‚Äôs why a poll in 2011 found 60% of people endorsed the changes she laid out: https://t.co/SoVZPUi3bG
Before Raimondo, state spending on pensions was going through the roof while the funding ratio declined. Now the growth has slowed significantly and the funding ratio has improved by several percentage points. RI is now on track for an 80% ratio by 2031. In ‚Äò10 it was 47%.
Not that I expected otherwise - but this is a trash take from Sirota. 		Pensions were broken in RI before Raimondo (cities were going bankrupt), and her fixes have freed up the fiscal space for investments in universal pre-k, free community college, and more. https://t.co/lJsanhcBgD

‚ÄúThe question we should be asking is not ‚Äúwhy did elites normalize trade with China in the 90s?‚Äù but rather ‚Äúwhat did many US towns, companies and workers do right in the face of intense import competition, and how can local, state and fed policies encourage that improvement?‚Äù
‚ÄúThe stark differences between these thriving US towns and those still reeling from a trade shock that likely ended a decade ago strongly indicates that the problem the shock revealed wasn‚Äôt import competition but‚Äîas the China Shock authors themselves assert‚Äîa failure to adjust.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis includes towns like Greenville‚ÄìSpartanburg, S.C.; Pittsburgh; Hickory, N.C.; Warsaw, Ind.; and others‚Äîtowns full of companies that succeeded by adapting to the market, importing industrial inputs, courting foreign investment and/or selling their goods abroad.‚Äù
‚ÄúMany places, big and small, that were once known for low-skill manufacturing and were hit hard by import competition have since then adapted and thrived.‚Äù
Potentially the most important point: ‚ÄúA final flaw in the PNTR thesis is that the longer-term effects of the import competition vary dramatically from place to place, even in states or regions that faced similarly intense competition from Chinese imports.‚Äù
Read @scottlincicome's piece on PNTR w/ China.		A few of the main points: the many positives of increased trade w/ China are ignored, China's own internal reforms increased export competitiveness, PNTR gave us rules (used and not used) to check China. https://t.co/6lG0dgjm9h

‚ÄúA new future is ours to write. It must be one of economic growth that‚Äôs not only sustainable but shared. To achieve it America must stay committed to working with all nations to build stronger and more prosperous economies for all our citizens for generations to come.‚Äù
‚Äú...while health-care costs grow at the slowest rate in 50 years; annual deficits cut by nearly three-quarters; and declining carbon emissions.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe results are clear: a more durable, growing economy; 15m new private-sector jobs since early 2010; rising wages, falling poverty, and the beginnings of a reversal in inequality; 20m more Americans with health insurance...‚Äù
‚ÄùI enacted a larger and more front-loaded fiscal stimulus than even President Roosevelt‚Äôs New Deal and oversaw the most comprehensive rewriting of the rules of the financial system since the 1930s, as well as reforming health care and introducing new rules cutting emissions.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe progress of the past eight years should also give the world some measure of hope. Despite all manner of division and discord, a second Great Depression was prevented. The financial system was stabilised without costing taxpayers a dime and the auto industry rescued.‚Äù
‚ÄúSustainable economic growth requires addressing climate change. Over the past five years, the notion of a trade-off between increasing growth and reducing emissions has been put to rest. America has cut energy-sector emissions by 6%, even as our economy has grown by 11%.‚Äù
‚ÄùCurbs to entitlement growth that build on the Affordable Care Act‚Äôs progress in reducing health-care costs and limiting tax breaks for the most fortunate can address long-term fiscal challenges without sacrificing investments in growth and opportunity.‚Äù
‚ÄúMaintaining fiscal discipline in good times to expand support for the economy when needed and to meet our long-term obligations to our citizens is vital.‚Äù
‚ÄúAmericans should debate how best to build on these rules, but denying that progress leaves us more vulnerable, not less so.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut even with all the progress, segments of the shadow banking system still present vulnerabilities and the housing-finance system has not been reformed.‚Äù
‚ÄúPost-crisis reforms to Wall Street have made our financial system more stable and supportive of long-term growth, including more capital for American banks, less reliance on short-term funding, and better oversight for a range of institutions and markets.‚Äù
‚ÄúReforms to our criminal-justice system and improvements to re-entry into the workforce that have won bipartisan support would also improve participation, if enacted.‚Äù
‚ÄúPaid leave and guaranteed sick days, as well as greater access to high-quality child care and early learning, would add flexibility for employees and employers.‚Äù
‚ÄùIncreasing access to high-quality community colleges, proven job-training models and help finding new jobs would assist. So would making unemployment insurance available to more workers.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere are many ways to keep more Americans in the labour market when they fall on hard times. These include providing wage insurance for workers who cannot get a new job that pays as much as their old one.‚Äù
‚ÄùRaising the min wage, expanding the EITC for workers without dependent children, limiting tax breaks for high-income households, preventing colleges from pricing out hardworking students, and ensuring men and women get equal pay would help to move us in the right direction too.‚Äù
‚ÄúIn the future, we need to be even more aggressive in enacting measures to reverse the decades-long rise in inequality. Unions should play a critical role. They help workers get a bigger slice of the pie but they need to be flexible enough to adapt to global competition.‚Äù
‚ÄúUnder my administration, we will have boosted incomes for families in the bottom fifth of the income distribution by 18% by 2017, while raising the average tax rates on households projected to earn over $8m per year‚Äîthe top 0.1%‚Äîby nearly 7 percentage points.‚Äù
‚ÄúEconomies are more successful when we close the gap between rich and poor and growth is broadly based. This is not just a moral argument. Research shows that growth is more fragile and recessions more frequent in countries with greater inequality.‚Äú
‚ÄúAs Abraham Lincoln said, ‚Äúwhile we do not propose any war upon capital, we do wish to allow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else.‚Äù That‚Äôs the problem with increased inequality‚Äîit diminishes upward mobility.‚Äù
‚ÄùSo, I will keep pushing for Congress to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership and to conclude a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the EU. These agreements, and stepped-up trade enforcement, will level the playing field for workers and businesses alike.‚Äù
‚ÄúExports helped lead us out of the recession. American firms that export pay their workers up to 18% more on average than companies that do not, according to a report by my Council of Economic Advisers.‚Äù
‚ÄúLifting productivity and wages also depends on creating a global race to the top in rules for trade. While some communities have suffered from foreign competition, trade has helped our economy much more than it has hurt.‚Äù
‚ÄúThese include everything from boosting funding for early childhood education to improving high schools, making college more affordable and expanding high-quality job training.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe could also help private investment and innovation with business-tax reform that lowers statutory rates and closes loopholes, and with public investments in basic research and development.‚Äù
‚ÄúFully restoring faith in the American economy requires addressing four major structural challenges: boosting productivity growth, combating rising inequality, ensuring that everyone who wants a job can get one and building a resilient economy that‚Äôs primed for future growth.‚Äù
‚ÄúAs appealing as some more radical reforms can sound in the abstract‚Äîbreaking up the biggest banks or erecting steep tariffs on imports‚Äîthe economy isn‚Äôt an abstraction. It can‚Äôt simply be redesigned wholesale and put back together again without real consequences for real people‚Äù
‚ÄúWithout trust, capitalism and markets cannot continue to deliver the gains they have delivered in the past centuries.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut, by itself, this will not lead to broadly shared prosperity and growth. Economists have long recognised that markets, left to their own devices, can fail. This can happen through the tendency towards monopoly and rent-seeking that this newspaper has documented...‚Äù
‚ÄúThe profit motive can be a powerful force for the common good, driving businesses to create products that consumers rave about or motivating banks to lend to growing businesses.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo we have a choice‚Äîretreat into old, closed-off economies or press forward, acknowledging the inequality that can come with globalisation while committing ourselves to making the global economy work better for all people, not just those at the top.‚Äù
‚ÄúWages have risen faster in real terms during this business cycle than in any since the 1970s. These gains would have been impossible without the globalisation and technological transformation that drives some of the anxiety behind our current political debate.‚Äù
‚ÄúOver the past 25 years, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has fallen from nearly 40% to under 10%. Last year, American households enjoyed the largest income gains on record and the poverty rate fell faster than at any point since the 1960s.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut amid this understandable frustration, much of it fanned by politicians who would actually make the problem worse rather than better, it is important to remember that capitalism has been the greatest driver of prosperity and opportunity the world has ever known.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not new, nor is it dissimilar to a discontent spreading throughout the world, often manifested in scepticism towards international institutions, trade agreements and immigration.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that a certain anxiety over the forces of globalisation, immigration, technology, even change itself, has taken hold in America.‚Äù
One of my favorite pieces about the world we live in today. @BarackObama in @TheEconomist: ‚ÄúFor all the work that remains, a new foundation is laid. A new future is ours to write. It must be one of economic growth that‚Äôs not only sustainable but shared.‚Äù https://t.co/sxM5efvlSJ

Thank you to @gsoh31 for making this argument better than I ever have been able to.
@timothyrennis Why‚Äôre you looking at coverage of my life from 2014?
@timothyrennis ‚ÄúMark O‚ÄôConnell‚Äù is a clever pen name, right?
‚Äù...One reason is that it is engaged in a war against its own history: if it took a more nuanced and more truthful view of Labour‚Äôs recent record, it would have a much better chance of success.‚Äù
‚ÄùLabour in its present shape appears to be struggling to convert the extra voters it needs to be sure of victory next time...‚Äù
‚Äú‚ÄòNeoliberalism‚Äô is a useful boo word, but its use in this context is both crude and unhelpful. No gov that rebuilt the public sphere, radically improved the state healthcare system, improved maintained schools and took on homelessness can possibly be painted only in those terms‚Äù
‚ÄúIts kaleidoscopic array of responses was therefore Rooseveltian in its ‚Äúdo what works‚Äù experimentation. It deserves a rather more sensitive characterisation than just repeating the one word ‚Äúneoliberalism‚Äù.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt has become a commonplace of leftwing thought that the New Labour governments were ‚Äúneoliberal‚Äù. But not only has the word itself now become so widely used as to have become almost meaningless, that analysis of Labour‚Äôs recent past doesn‚Äôt even make sense in its own terms.‚Äù
‚ÄúNew Labour in power was a party with a powerful analysis of state and society: that globalisation was inevitable, and the British people had to be educated enough, healthy enough and informed enough to stand up to it.‚Äù	https://t.co/m2bPgVmvHK

"We can be true to our long-held beliefs while truthfully connecting these issues to the bread and butter concerns constant in people‚Äôs lives." -@timkaine
"Let‚Äôs make immigration reform as much about the strength of our workforce as a civil rights issue. Let‚Äôs make climate change a national security imperative as much as a question of environmental stewardship."
"On the economy, we should stress our long track record of being better for the country on job and wage growth. And as we work to resolve internal differences on regulatory and tax policy, we should stress our unity on job training, higher wages and infrastructure investments."
"We are curiously absent on national security messaging...We should speak up and speak out on behalf of strengthening security, supporting our troops and veterans and restoring robust diplomacy and alliances to keep us safe."
"There are many other reasons for our successes‚Äîhard work, a concerted effort to appeal to Virginia‚Äôs changing demography, a willingness to run and govern as practical progressives, the state GOP penchant for nominating ideological culture warriors, the unpopularity of Trump."
"Our winning congressional candidates each had strong security backgrounds ‚Äì Jennifer Wexton was a successful prosecutor, Elaine Luria a Navy commander, Abigail Spanberger a CIA analyst. We spoke clearly and plainly to voters‚Äô safety concerns."
"I emphasized my work on the Armed Services Committee and strong record as a pro-economic growth mayor and governor to ultimately outperform my Republican opponent on [national security and the economy] by double digits."
"First, when asked which party more reliably can keep America safe, even the Democratic-leaning Virginia electorate gives Republicans a seven-point edge. Second, when asked which party is a greater risk on the economy, Virginians said Democrats by that same seven-point margin."
"But these successes [on Nov. 6th] can obscure an important warning for Democrats in Virginia and nationally: our party is struggling with voters on national security and the economy."
