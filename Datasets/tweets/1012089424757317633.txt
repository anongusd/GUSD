@MBEmpower @Trident__ @SonnieJohnson @MehrsaBaradaran A #BlackAgenda should address these issues #AmericanDOS face in America. #Reparations2020 is necessary to give redress to the RacialWealthGap that persists in our economy and is widening at an alarming rate. @marwilliamson @SandyDarity @DarrickHamilton @StephanieKelton my choice.
@MBEmpower @Trident__ @SonnieJohnson @MehrsaBaradaran Black banks would fare better in these emerging markets and better serve their customers in a more cost effective manner. The $66 Billion Dollar merger of BB&amp;T and SunTrust Bank has made Black Banks vulnerable to consolidation.
@MBEmpower @Trident__ @SonnieJohnson @MehrsaBaradaran I thought the inability of Black banks to aquire credit aside from buying US backed securities makes investing in emerging economies a viable alternative to security bonds that have no real value of growth. International markets are cutting interest rates while growing GDP.
@MBEmpower @ThomasSowell @cvpayne is now parroting the same tropes and @davidwebbshow is co-signing the empty rhetoric that has left #AmericanDOS in no better condition than in 1968 when unemployment was 6.7%. #Reparations2020 #LineageMatters #NoBlackAgendaNoVote

@vanz1965 @TheWayWithAnoa Race is a con, but the label "black" puts a certain group at the bottom. The data points directly to the fact that "class" is specific to race in America. Progressives and Dems can no longer run candidates who ignore this group.

@OfficialCBC The Bureau of Labor and Statistics has data to support the economic disparities between the races and is good metric to measure racial wealth gap in America. Black voters will demand these issues be met in the upcoming elections. https://t.co/noPEWYvaSp
@OfficialCBC The migrant crisis is literally "taking the air out of the room". The media coverage is nonstop. Meanwhile,  Americans still do not make a living wage. The Middle Black family is worth $1700 in wealth after depreciation. The bottom 50% of Black households are worth less than $1.
@OfficialCBC this is an ongoing problem within our criminal justice system. Where is the outrage when one of our fellow Americans dies in police custody? Why is there no political motivation to stop senseless killings of Blacks at the hands of Police, or to end street violence?
While I advocate for Police Unions, and as a fellow Mississippian, Mississippi has a long history of covering up senseless deaths of Black women and men at the hands of Law enforcement. https://t.co/pAVtq0iJgG

@ashtonpittman @jerameyanderson Those 20% are the ones like myself who are disenchanted with the Democratic and Republican parties and their reluctance to solve immigration and economic issues that impact Americans. Specifically,  #AmericanDOS and poor white families who are living pay check to pay check.
@jerameyanderson These programs helped stabilize our communities. Globalization of markets and deindustrialization have left Blacks at the bottom of wealth accumulation in the country. Unregulated immigration counterproductive to Americans who have built this country. #CitizenshipMatters
@jerameyanderson The Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 provided gov funding to help train #AmericanDOS and poor white families for skilled jobs and created stable middle class. Democrats and Republicans cut funding for JTPA and Workforce Opportunity Act of 1982 and 1998 respectively.
@jerameyanderson Specifically, immigration as it effects the African American community. Blacks are experiencing wealth calcification and joblessness, while corporations devalue labor for cheaper, less skilled immigrants.
@jerameyanderson I attended the rally for you in Biloxi and canvased on you and Mike Espy's behalf. As an Independent voter I am in disagreement with the Democratic Party's foreign, and domestic policies. I think if Democrats want to win the Ms State Senate in 2020 these issues must be solved
@jerameyanderson I bet if you did a poll of the state of Mississippi those percentages would be way higher. African Americans are becoming increasingly concerned with immigration, wealth inequality  and mass incarceration. These are the issues that affect African Americans and all citizens of USA
The percentage would be higher if poor and working class Americans were on board with an open boarders policy. Democrats and Progressives need to focus on everyday Americans. Specifically, #AmericanDOS who have fallen through the cracks. https://t.co/4zG8IyGWlq

Unfortunately, #AmericanDOS have not had the opportunity to experience wealth in America.  The argument for reparations faces this very dilima.

@TheWayWithAnoa We campaigned our butts off for Mike Espy here in Ms only to be outdone by Phil Bryant and the purging of thousands of voters. Race played a big part in the outcome as well. The Southern Strategy was to make Mike look dangerous to white conservative voters
