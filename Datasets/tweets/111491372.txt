Have no respect for people who change parties for either convenience or a piece of ass. Their reasoning is  essentially the same.
Love her or hate her, there is only one Democrat in this presidential race: @HillaryClinton. #Democrats2016 #PartyFaithful
As a decades-long Democrat I cannot and will not support a candidate for president who registered with the Party for campaign convenience.
I am a Democrat. A decades-long Democrat. I will VOTE Democrat.
I have organized candidate forums and have shown up to support my party on the ground and in the trenches...
I have campaigned in Vegas going into Super Tuesday...
For elections, I've co-hosted fundraisers, walked precincts... hell, I've even gone door-to-door going into the New Hampshire primary....
I also committed. I've registered voters, answered phones, stuffed envelopes... And those were in the NON-election years!
It took work. I didn't base my choice on sound bytes or how rich a candidate was or even a perfect winning streak. I studied; I reflected.
I changed parties once. I was in my early 20s and learned enough about their differences AND examined my own beliefs to find the best fit.

Once upon a time, Tom Hanks was starting out too. Love him dearly but still saw @IamDonCheadle as the lead when reading DaVinci Code.
But I desperately implore casting directors to play the "takeaway" game and cast actors according to talent so they can rise.
I want to see SPOTLIGHT be feted and garner the attention it so richly deserves... (A perfect movie, IMHO) #Oscars
I won't be boycotting the #Oscars because, dammit, I want to see Brie Larson have her moment for her fabulous performance in ROOM...
I don't always know their names but from this exercise I know there are many roles that can be diversely cast. The talent is there.
Sometimes,  I can see many actors cast for a particular role.
Sometimes I'm spot on. I've seen films cast EXACTLY the way I cast them in reading the book.
In my mind's eye, I take out actors, replace them with others, alter scripts, even locations. If that changes the film, then I judge.
I am white, with WASP-ish tendencies.  That said, as a movie-goer, all too often I judge a film or performance by playing "takeaway"...
My taste has favored those films that tend to get nominated and feted as being among the best, not necessarily the most successful.
I'm a movie-goer and have been since I was little. I have always adored the well-told story, from the actors to the writers to the crew...

Highly recommend THE MARTIAN with for paws up.
It had a lot of humor despite the seriousness. Damon delivered a few lines w/an unmistakable Boston accent/attitude which made it funnier.
THE MARTIAN was most excellent storytelling. It maintained a nice balance between Mission Control and surviving on Mars...
Think the phrase "How do you like THEM apples" is due for a comeback.  I prefer Galas and Fujis.

Of course, abuse is how Big Pharma makes its profits. But do we see any candidate calling out Big Pharma? Uh. No.
Personally, I support medical marijuana but not legalizing recreational use. With use, comes abuse.
That's like saying, "Yes, the freeways are collapsing but let me tell you about the time my roof collapsed. We need to govern contractors."
Fiorina diverted the conversation to share her, albeit sad, story of losing a child to drugs. So, she wants to focus on drug treatment.
Medical marijuana is not the same as recreational marijuana. The former is used as a medicine; the latter is used to get high...

Fact is, ALL of us were touched by events that day. We won't forget. We shouldn't forget...
Learning the hijackers had actually been on one of our island's beaches watching the airport...
Having friends check in, the dead silence over the island with Logan shut down, learning neighbors were on the flight crew...
A patchwork of memories from that day: watching the WTC fall, watching the Pentagon burn, cousins missing, Aunts being consoled...
8:20 am that morning, on my way to the T, traffic locked up suddenly when Logan learned a plane had been hijacked. https://t.co/azVWho5l7y

People make themselves crazy trying to come up with ideas on repurposing and upcycling into things they really don't need or want.
Clothing donation bins accept all fabric items. Some clothes are bulk-sold. Others are merely sent to fabric recyclers.  Sheets are fabric.

Glad I got that out of my system.
Now a simplicity person or a frugal one may score the freebie and donate to a shelter or rescue. Frugal one would also tak tax deduction.
It's not simple because you've just complicated your storage. It's not frugal because sitting unused on a shelf is pure waste.
Having 150 flea collars for cats in your stockpile when you don't have a cat just because you got it free, is neither simple nor frugal.
One should NEVER assume the extreme couponer is either, however.  There is such a thing as a cheapskate shopaholic.
Or similarly if the pet owner always uses the same brand but also always seeks to find the best deal on it from the choices of usual stores.
Now where the concepts may overlap is if the banking person chooses the one with the overall best rate and has all accounts there.
Another example: someone keeping it simple may buy the same pet food each time, whereas the frugal person buys what's on sale.
Someone may choose to use a single bank to keep it simple. Someone frugal may use more than one b/c the banks offer different rates.
"Simplicity" means to uncomplicate. "Frugality" means to not be wasteful.  Sometimes the two concepts intersect but they are distinct.

Well here's one of the green snugglies. :) http://t.co/XZEfORSrfA
In meditation, the random thoughts can be sorted, examined and enjoyed. Now... about those green snugglies...
My brain. 24/7. THIS is why I meditate.
But I've heard it's very green. Green is a great color. I should knit more green snugglies for Rescue. What goes well with green?
Ah! The Cat with Jade Eyes. Wonder if it's available on amazon. I ‚ô• amazon! Though I've no interest in going TO the amazon.
Should the file be yellow? What's the *meaning* of yellow? My cat has yellow eyes. What was the name of the book I read as a kid?
And my meditation can get pretty darn random: the cat needs to be brushed, I should organize this file that way, I love yellow...
We absorb everything around us, and meditation - like sleep - is when our minds reboot. So all those thoughts are like random bytes &amp; bits.
What I've since learned is that it takes work to relax. And that's fairly "normal". Our minds are set on "GO".
A couple years later, in an Easter series at church, led by a progressive priest we had, I finally reached a nice, meditative state again.
Years later, after I finished law school, I thought I'd try it for realz, but I.Just.Couldn't.Quite.Get.There.
My first real experience with it was in an art class - Color Theory, which I ‚ô• (ah, but I digress) - and I relaxed in a way I hadn't before.
Meditation is kind of a new thing for me. It was considered weird when I was growing up...
Can't say it would enhance my ESP but if I feel drawn to any numbers that actually win the lottery, I'll let you know.

But I've always understood one thing: Leonard Nimoy as Spock. It was most logical. RIP, Sir. And thank you.
Am not a Trekkie and can count episodes I've ever seen on one hand...
"Reflection" is your self-examination.  Looking at another and seeing yourself is the definition of narcissism.
Anytime someone agrees with me 100% all the time, I step away. If I wanted a lap-dog, I'd adopt one.
If we didn't have different opinions,  we wouldn't grow as people or progress as a culture.
You all know that the real takeaway of that dress's color is that we can all see things differently and that's OK.
Good morning,  Everyone!  Much love,  peace and reflection. ..oxx
Here's the best cleanse there is: plain ol' water.  Every cell in our bodies want it and need it. Get it in!
Love soup. Have always loved soup. Either I've been ahead of the trend or... I just love soup. lol

Good morning,  Friends! Much love, peace and critical thinking...oxx

@Noellegi Awesomeness!  Congrats! (((HUGS)))
Back to my ginger ale.
Caught him and parked him on some grass.
Really hope no one steps on him while I finish.
After I finish my ginger ale.
It's not a roach. It's a cricket. Think I'll repatriate it to the great outdoors.
Am a kind soul. Let bees, roaches &amp;  spiders live so long as they don't try to move in w/me. Wait.  I gave Spinner a corner in the bathroom.
RT @jonnythumper: @Meezer_Mom what? My beanie baby collection is worthless? How will I retire?

A thing's value is determined by what someone else is willing to pay for it at that point in time &amp; not one cent more. Ex. A: Beanie Babies
All I see is junk, really. A $200 coupon on something I'd never use is worthless.
As I went down the list, like I said, I'd be in for the wine - and maaayyybe the fluffy balls to give to the cat - but otherwise,  NO.
A friend noted that the only way to get free stuff is not to need it. There is truth in that. But do we WANT this stuff?
