@AnaCabrera Ana, I told @TiffanyDCross about a month ago that I was going to do everything I could to get her on @CNN more. EXCELLENT response on Delaney Tiffany!! You look Great on the CNN Channel!!! Two Great Women at the same time!!! 👍❤️❤️
@JustJoeyLopez @jamie_ehrlich @JoeyJacksonEsq @AnaCabrera 😰... yup... Let’s wait for the facts... 👍
@JustJoeyLopez @jamie_ehrlich @JoeyJacksonEsq @AnaCabrera We just have to wait and see what Jussie’s next interview will tell us next, and go from there... 😕
@JustJoeyLopez @jamie_ehrlich @JoeyJacksonEsq @AnaCabrera UNFORTUNATELY... 🥶
@JustJoeyLopez @jamie_ehrlich @JoeyJacksonEsq @AnaCabrera It is something to think about. Law Enforcement sometimes offer immunity “IF” the two brothers can provide “significant” evidence about the case; in particular, if Jussie actually ASKED them to make those purchases (rope and other items,) and “assault” him. It is Probable... 😞

@JustJoeyLopez @jamie_ehrlich @JoeyJacksonEsq IMMUNITY- Joey, you hit the nail on the head, Brother!! @AnaCabrera More than likely they offered immunity to the brothers, if in fact, they received the receipts to purchase items, to corroborate Jussie’s “fake/ orchestrated” story. Lord please don’t let this be the case... 🥶😰
@JustJoeyLopez @jamie_ehrlich @JoeyJacksonEsq You’re Absolutely Right...
@jamie_ehrlich @JoeyJacksonEsq I really hope he didn’t make it up... #FactsFirst

@AnaCabrera Replay that last part in a tweet please! I missed it!!! 😞
@IreneLovesPR REMOVE THE WEAPONS. If he won’t allow you to, notify Law Enforcement, ask to speak to a supervisor, and let him/ her know what’s going on. (Your Safety, His Safety, and the safety of others is Imperative.) Keep police/ sheriff advised of what’s going on. (Law Enforcement Safety.)
@Lilyflowerbug @AnaCabrera What would he gain by this?
@Lilyflowerbug @AnaCabrera What’s his motive?
@AnaCabrera What’s his motive??
@IreneLovesPR If he’s willing to go to the hospital, prayfully the hospital can give him some type of evaluation for all of you to go on. It will let you know his mental and physical health. If he’s willing to go, that’s 90% of getting where he needs to be. Patience is priceless... ❤️
@IreneLovesPR It takes a while to sink in sometimes.. Just be patient with him. Don’t rush him. He just has to process it... You guys are in my thought and prayers... ❤️
@AnaCabrera I just don’t believe that... 😕
