Longevity. It's a huge aspect to successful campaigning. Are you in it for the long haul? Has your campaign game been as strong as it was since day 1? Are you out there knocking on doors til the very last hour? #uspol #campaigns #longevity #politics https://t.co/fKHNXFK8UH
Just like candidates don't have to be wealthy to run, people don't have to be wealthy to donate. Philanthropy is not just for millionaires. So don't be afraid to ask for campaign donations, even if it's only $5, it will go a long way. #uspoli #campaigns #2018elections https://t.co/zzw3jvYaPb
During campaigns, when you ask potential donors for money, remember one thing: This is not selfish. You run for office because you want to make a difference and represent your people. Remember that the money you raise is going to help you get into office, you are the cause #uspol https://t.co/vtDFsNeczy

Do you know what SEO is? Search Engine Optimization. And although there is a certain science to it, it's not that difficult to figure out how to get your social media posts to the top of the search list to gain traction. Use key words in your post that target your public! #seo https://t.co/cWjut11Bg5
A solid social media campaign can make a huge difference in your success. They say the best things in life are free. The best thing about social media, is that it is one of the most useful tools - &amp; it's free to use. #SoMe #campaigns #uspoli #2018elections #politics https://t.co/RdmxrW4o0J
If you are running for office, USE SOCIAL MEDIA! There has never been an easier way to stay in immediate and direct contact with thousands and thousands of supporters. Social media lets you reach out to every single one of your supporters with jut a few keystrokes. #uspol #SoMe https://t.co/IWWnTZmKwm
If you haven't announced you're running yet, it wont hurt to initiate a preliminary campaign, getting public about issues you care about, why things need to change, &amp; hinting at a potential run. Then, after you've built suspense, announce an official run. Your public will love it https://t.co/ztHyRqhROL
Create an email schedule and stick to it! Set dates to send a first email announcing your candidacy, a second email asking for donations, &amp; update emails throughout your campaign. You have to get a solid line of communication toward your constituents to secure the win! #campaigns https://t.co/hycns9Xd77
Is your election date far off?	If so, here's our message to you:		Don't wait to fund-raise!	Never ever think that you can put off strengthening your campaign.	Take this time to make potential voters love you.	It's never too early to raise money for your campaign!	#USPOL #Campaign https://t.co/xXawzsY32V
11 days until Arizona's CD-8 Special Election primary! When you're at the home stretch, your campaign needs to mobilize. Knock on doors. Call everyone you know.

Have “big ticket” and “small ticket” events. Plenty of donors can't contribute $500 for your black tie gala, but would be happy to attend a $25 barbecue. Similarly, a plenty of donors who would not come to a $10 coffee, but would gladly attend a $450 candidate’s night. #uspol https://t.co/yBQXnUIYLC
Candidates don't need a boatload of money in their bank account to win an election. What they do need is a financially healthy campaign. If the right people believe in your plans for office, they will donate enough to sustain a campaign until election day. Share your plan. #uspol https://t.co/M90jwnAnib
Looking to run for office? Have you secured stable funding? Check your state's ethics website to see if there are any local PACs that would endorse you and donate to your campaign. Get your major political party's blessing. Get connected with organizations that will help. 	#Uspol https://t.co/7M99DADJO8
Unless local custom prevents it, the candidate should have a “kick-of” fundraiser on or shortly after the day she announces her candidacy.  Such an event not only injects needed funds to the new campaign, it also tests the fundraising apparatus and gives the campaign momentum.#us https://t.co/FvGJ6Hu2Ox
On this day in 1879 - U.S. President Hayes signed a bill that allowed female attorneys to argue cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. #USC #uspol #aba https://t.co/wPU3p0nvGp
When seeking major donors, many people who cant write you a check for $10,000 right now can write you a check for $500 each month until election day.  Focus major fundraising on raising scheduled gifts, This makes it easy for people w/ much to give, but not at the moment. #uspoli https://t.co/qfgaJC5l2N
Good way to find more donors? Likely, your current campaign volunteers &amp; donors have friends with similiar interests. Get you current campaign volunteers to invite THEIR friends to your next campaign event! Then, start cultivating them as potential donors. #Benevon #Politics https://t.co/4AiGd3SeIU
When you want to increase donors, try to cultivate potential donors by connecting your campaign to their deep interests. After several meetings, make the ask. Some will be ready to be asked for donations immediately, others need relationship building. https://t.co/P1ig2i9c1M
Every campaign, no matter how small, must have a fundraising plan in place that spells out how much money is to be raised, when that money is needed, what it is needed for and how it is going to be raised.  #campaign #plan #leveltheplayingfield https://t.co/Azmsqh4LvS
Before asking potential donors or PACs to contribute, the campaign should decide how much it thinks each person could give. The candidate should then ask the donor to contribute 20% more than that amount. The donor will usually offer to give an amount somewhere in between. https://t.co/LMecfSxnBS
When seeking major donations, seek leadership gifts first. Small donations elevate campaigns, but major gifts keep them afloat. Before publicly announcing your campaign's end goal, approach major donors first. Try to raise 25-50% of your end goal, then roll out your campaign. https://t.co/kqQwCOPimP
When meeting potential donors on the campaign trail, follow up! Those who aren't interested in learning more about your campaign, should be let off the hook completely. This will pleasantly disarm people &amp; allow them to suggest others who would be interested in your campaign. https://t.co/zj43yiU7Hr
Happy Valentines day from @DonorDex !!!!This is a good day to show appreciation for your campaign staff &amp; donors. Plus, free chocolate never hurt a campaign! #2018elections #campaigns #happyvalentinesday https://t.co/iXO0dT0bCZ
After you've cultivated your guests over several weeks or months, invite them to attend an inspiring, mission-focused, one-hour free campaign luncheon fundraising event. At the end of the event, ask them to join your "Golden Team", by donating $100 a month until election day. https://t.co/Krf8HqM6jH
There are 2 ways to get a donor to contribute to your campaign: you can ask her to donate money herself, or you can ask her to get her contacts to contribute. Do both. Campaigns should encourage donors to set up fundraising networks. Get your friends' friends to help. #campaigns https://t.co/ozlAS4rU1b
The federal government, all states and even most counties and towns have individual campaign finance laws that spell out who can contribute, how much they may give, what contributions may be spent on, what needs to be reported, etc. Always familiarize yourself with the law! #FEC https://t.co/w2a7eVSRd5
When approaching donors, you want to have a professionally designed prospectus that explains your campaign, why you're running, what are donations going toward, and what level gifts you are seeking.  Major donors respond to well thought plans. #uspolitics #uspol #campaigns https://t.co/6jVWM6mOPZ
After a campaign event, have your team make follow up calls to solicit feedback &amp; see if they want to be involved, ideally by volunteering. Let guests who are interested in you campaign get involved however they prefer. This will expand your campaign, &amp; cultivate future donors. https://t.co/DrFALIHmn8

Major donors expect personal contact with the candidate, and will be far less likely to give if anyone but the candidate is the one who contacts them. It is usually O.K. to have staff make follow up calls to big donors who have already given to the campaign. https://t.co/IMImphA26V
Unless your local custom provides otherwise, steer clear of Friday night fundraisers. Fridays are when your potential donors are the most tired, most likely to be traveling out of town, and most likely to want to get home as quickly as possible. Choose Saturday. #uspol #uspoli https://t.co/Z0GFcrMIjx
Campaigns should have an "end goal" for funding. This funding should be budgeted toward media exposure, events, office rent and paid staff. Some campaigns can easily raise 1 million, and some, $5k. Whatever it is, keep the end goal reasonable, &amp; visionary. https://t.co/ZaQxBxQDEu
Want to gain more potential donors? Have your campaign staff invite their friends to a succinct, one-hour introductory event that educates and inspires guests with the facts and stories about your work. #Benevon #Campaign #Fundraising #politics #501c3 https://t.co/VLxyVUud3V

Do you have traditional fundraising down pat? Mailers, donation envelopes, etc? Older generations respond well to traditional fundraising. But utilizing the digital sphere means an instant phone call to potential donors, &amp;they're  more likely to answer the phone than your mailer. https://t.co/XppgWpuVzW
#BeHumble. It's an important concept in campaigning. The biggest names have to ask for money to compete. So, if you're not a big-name, take note: Everyone has to do it. And the more you ask, the bigger your name gets. #Leveltheplayingfield https://t.co/aNfTvnsaiU
@DonorDex is not just for politicians! Our app targets county, state, city, or senate/house districts all across the nation. If your 501(C)3, 501(C)4 or PAC needs funding or to get a message across to your constituents, this app is a useful platform for you! https://t.co/zcUXseSbpb
Don't have enough time to fund-raise? Create a schedule! Make your first round of calls. Then, follow up with them. Always give a 'last call.' The more you stay on schedule, the more donors you're bound to reach. https://t.co/PPDPdKigI2

Remember when you first decided that you were going to make a difference? Were you big? Did you have it all? Did it all come in one day? Ofcourse not! Take the same approach w/ fundraising. The earlier you start, the better. Start off small, and start early, it will pay off later https://t.co/fmQpgiaWu3
Ever catch yourself with the fundraising bug one week, but not feeling it the next? KEEP MOMENTUM! There is ZERO downtime in fundraising! If you're having an off day, commit to contacting at least 50 donors as the bottom line standard! #uspol #501c3 #c4 #campaign https://t.co/7LfXzPKQqT
FUNDRAISING FEARS: Would you rather ask someone you don't know for donations than someone you do? Why - is it because it's too  personal? Well, it's time to get over those fears. When fundraising, call everyone you know! You'll be surprised at who's willing to give! https://t.co/QQ9tbS49ez
When fundraising, be personal! When talking to donors,this is an opportunity  to ask what issues donors care about. Get personal with potential donors, it relieves the awkwardness of asking for money. https://t.co/klrDHJp3ae

Tip #1: LISTEN to the people you call. Yes, they are interested in what you have to say and what your plan is once you get in office. However, people want their voices to be heard and feel that you truly care about what is best for THEM and not just for yourself. #vote2018
Over the next 5 days we will be releasing our #top10fundraisingtips! Keep your eyes peeled 👀 Follow us along the way as we continue to help candidates work through the challenges of fundraising and winning their election #vote2018 #2018election
Primaries for many states are creeping up quickly. Ask yourself, are you doing all you can for your campaign? If you answered no, it's not too late! If you answered yes, you can ALWAYS do more. We know what it takes to win... being relentless. Start calling more donors/voters!
Whether it's a Federal race or a run for City Council, fundraising and connecting personally with individual voters/donors sits at the top of the list of campaign priorities. Get on the phone! #vote2018 #donate2018 #campaign #2018election
Remember, even if a person can't donate at this time, they are still likely to vote in the election. If you can't secure a donation make sure you still secure their vote before you get off the phone! #vote2018 #campaign #fundraising #2018election
The candidate making calls directly to donors adds a unique personal touch and is highly effective. However, we strongly recommend you also have a team of people making calls in order to increase volume. Total number of calls is very important!
The key to successful campaign fundraising is ensuring as many people as possible know about it. You may be missing out on important donations if you aren't properly utilizing all of your communication channels. Make your campaigns fundraising efforts impossible to miss.
Donations from your family and friends will only get you so far... It is imperative that you find a way to get on the phone with the citizens in your district. They are the ones who will drive you to victory.
@electjohnmoser Hi John!		For your records, our address is 8191 College Parkway, Suite 300 Fort Myers, FL 33919
Remember, when calling people in your district, the personal connection you make with someone could be the tipping point in the voting booth come election time, even if they didn't donate at the time you spoke with them #2018election #campaigntips
How many citizens in your district/state do you plan to call during your campaign run?
A well practiced pitch is important but make sure you spend some time just listening to the people you call as well. People want to be heard and to feel incorporated in your plan for the place you both call home #2018election
Large donors are important, but the smaller consistent donations are what will keep the campaign on it's feet in the long run. In order to win, you must be able to connect with donors of all levels. #campaignfundraisingtips #2018election
Fundraising for your campaign begins with giving people sound reasons to donate. When calling donors, always ensure your stance and message are clear and be prepared to outline the major things you want to accomplish in office #campaignfundraisingtips #2018election
All eyes on #AlabamaSenateElection for what has been possibly the most high profile Senate race in modern history.
Did you know campaigns that started fundraising at least 1 year before their elections accounted for 64% of winning candidates in 2016? That means if you haven't started yet, now may be a good time to get going! Adequate fundraising is essential to winning your seat.
Has your campaign started fundraising for the 2018 election yet?
