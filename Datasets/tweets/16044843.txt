We really need to implement instant runoff voting at all levels of selections, federal to local, general to primary. It‚Äôs the only way to make sure that every elected official has the support of at least .the majority of their constituents.
So #Trump is going to repeat Obama‚Äôs biggest mistake by pulling troops out of a war zone too early. He is essentially surrendering to #ISIS, and, 18 years after 9/11, we are surrendering to the Taliban. What else would you expect from Cadet Bone Spurs?
Our president is publicly insulting our nation‚Äôs intelligence chiefs. And he gave security clearances to 30 people of his staff who couldn‚Äôt pass the background check, including his own son-in-law. This is so frightening. #Trump
In my opinion, the government should NEVER be shut down for any reason.

@afodge President and Senate have equal say in who gets on Supreme Court, so why should it matter if it‚Äôs a presidential or election year? Also, Scalia died 9 months before election, 11 months before inauguration. Unacceptable under any moral standard.
@afodge It was 14 months between Scalia‚Äôs death and his replacement being sworn in. Unacceptable. But by your logic, this is also an election year, should we not wait until after. New Congress is seated to even consider filling Kennedy‚Äôs seat?
@afodge Waiting for over a year to fill a Supreme Court seat is outrageous. They used the Election Year as a one excuse. If there was a Republican president they would have confirmed no questions asked. It‚Äôs a stolen seat.
@afodge Keeping a seat open for over a year for political reasons is completely irresponsible. They were basically refusing to do their job and failed the American people.
@afodge Well honestly Obama had the right to nominate a full fledged liberal but chose a moderate liberal like Garland to appease the Republicans. So in a way, you‚Äôre right, the seat probably should have been filled by someone even more liberal than Garland.
Honestly, with the way that Merrick Garland‚Äôs Seat was stolen, justice will not be done until Trump nominates a moderate liberal to replace a hard right conservative to balance the scales. #SCOTUSNomination #StopKavanaugh
I believe that the Constitution should be amended so that all Presidential nominations must be confirmed by both the House and Senate. And on any vote on any issue, a 2/3 vote of the House should be able to override a Senate vote.
@David_Gergen Trump is more likely to go on a Twitter tantrum about how much he hates the FBI and it's all a conspiracy to take him down. Since when has Trump shown respect to women?
@MSNBC If by ‚Äúriveting‚Äù you mean damning, then sure.

Worth noting that McCain, who lost in 2008 in a landslide (not really his fault, he was running against hugely popular Obama in a very anti-R year), got less than 0.5% less votes than Trump, who "won" his election.
