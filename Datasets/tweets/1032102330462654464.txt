@JudicialWatch @realDonaldTrump Good on you. Poor guy, his life is ruined.  I hope Killary doesn't suicide him.
If I were Trump, I'd order Rosenstein to order Mueller to provide a report in 60 days. If they don't, I'd fire them both on November 9.
That's why we are patiently waiting for Lady Justice to level the scales. https://t.co/DsEYCOpp0N
