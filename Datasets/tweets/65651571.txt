Big early funding mechanism identified was as series of fees that now go to general revenue being directed to a transportation trust fund. Many of those fees were raised in 2009, so there will be a fight over whether to use that $ to fund project or lower them to pre-09 levels
Client on this issue is RV trade group. Their concern is fee increases that that industry faced in 2009 when the great recession hit. Those fees would now be used to fund Galvano's priority, but some trade groups want the fees lowered to pre-recession levels

Florida insurance regulators have had to turn records over as part of that probe		Background-plus		https://t.co/3k9BnPnAvz
Oh, yeah, and Lindberg and his companies are under federal investigation. The bill was likely signed by @SenRickScott while the feds combed through company records.		Background		https://t.co/vvIAKZNZT9
Nov. '17 is important for all of this. That month...		‚úîÔ∏èState regulators flagged a Lindberg company for being in non-compliance w/ an order imposed by insurance regulators		‚úîÔ∏èDughi proposed the language that helped with the problem		‚úîÔ∏èLindberg became huge GOP donor out of nowhere
Sponsors of the insurance bill @JeffreyBrandes and @dsantiago457 said they were aware of the policy issue, but Lindberg or his issues w/ the state did not come up as part of this. they didn't know it was for a specific company. The language was small part of a 51-page ins bill
That is the issue that caused trouble for one of Lindberg's insurers.Regulators said the company overstated its assets. The reason was because it counted subsidiary investments above the levels allowed by state law. 	The language Dughi got in the insurance bill fixed that issue
Language was sent into Senate staff by @GT_Law's Leslie Dughi, a member of Lindberg's contract lobbying team. The language aimed to allow out of state insurers, like those owned by Lindberg, to include additional investments in their subsidiaries when doing solvency reviews https://t.co/qe217ybl9y
Language in Florida's 2018 omnibus insurance package changed a state law that was at the heart of a regulatory fight between Florida officials and companies owned by Greg Lindberg, a North Carolina businessman and out-of-nowhere huge Florida GOP donor

RT @politicofl: A year after sexual misconduct investigations took down former state Sen. Jack Latvala, the Florida Senate quietly overhaul‚Ä¶
Oh boy https://t.co/ovdmCCfk9M
This should be senate rules *complaint* process
@sdbfo Yep. Presiding officers (House Speaker or Senate President) has the ability to change rules in their chamber for the two years they are in charge. These rules are approved by the chamber in a vote. All 40-senators approved these new rules during quick vote last week
That is kind of normal. Rules votes are often seen as very procedural, and often times there is little substantive change. Just so happened there were pretty big changes to the new version of Senate rules passed last week.
Whatever you think of these changes, it's no longer a partisan issue. The new Senate Rules were approved last week unanimously by the Senate's 40 person chamber. There was no discussion or public push back, just a quick floor vote during chamber's organization session
@sdbfo The explanation is that one committee is to determine probable cause, while the other can do continued investigation and determine what action, if any, should be taken. So, two committees for two different layers of action
New Senate rules also create a process for Senator to fix violations and face an informal penalty or reprimand. Galvano said this section was created to be used when there were minor rules violations. Nothing in language, though, limits the type of complaint it can be applied to https://t.co/UWsOULaAZH
Additional changes discourage Senators from speaking publicly about any rules complaint. During the Latvala saga, many Senators chimed in, including calling for him to resign early in the process. https://t.co/3N3VPI1rPf
Senate President Galvano says the potential 2 layers of special committees he appoints ads clarity to the process. Each layer, if two committees are used, has its own defined job and goal. Some experts, though, think the plan sets up big hurdles for those filing rules complaints https://t.co/NtvSiURs9Z
Under new rules, if complaint is not tossed it heads to a second select committee appointed by the Senate president. That committee can toss it, or make its own recommendations after a review. Old rules required this step to be Sen Rules Comttee https://t.co/SvXhItPOIh
@sirensoIiIoquy No. This is overhaul to the Senate rules complaint process. Internal process used by Senate to deal with this stuff.
Take, for instance, this change. The red are is new additions/removal of language done by Senate staff. Change adds an option to send complaints to a select committee appointed by the Sen president rather than do an outside special master investigation, which is still an option. https://t.co/oChdgEsiPc
But there are portions that concern sexual harassment experts. These are changes to the Senate rules committee process, which played a big role in the downfall of Sen. Latvala
The rules do now include provisions to close meetings to allow alleged victims to testify anonymously, a 30 day timeline to take action so complaints are not buried, and a requirement that the Sen general counsel get complaints. This is designed to be a check on chamber leaders
Incoming Senate president said the overhaul was to remove ambiguity and make the process more efficient, while some outside experts said some changes could have "devastating" impact 	 https://t.co/2hx6q4bzLv

@CHeathWFTV @anthonypedicini @FlaDems When I first saw the documents, it looked to me as though Democrats were telling their people that they could fix ballots after they could actually fix ballots, which would ensure their vote might not count
Names were given of voters and volunteers. Identifying information is given, which is why we are not posting audio
@anthonypedicini @FlaDems Not sure what to think. Feels a bit like some volunteer groups who didn't know dates. I mean, on those docs they were telling people to fix something after the deadline. Would seem to be bad for their side.
Same general theme as documents turned over to federal prosecutors. Encouraging people to fix mail ballots after deadline.

Which is why I think they'd have wanted it out there sooner, but who knows. We are way past silly season on all fronts at this point
Odd thing is @FLGovScott, and other Republicans had been looking for some law enforcement hook to hang fraud allegations on. This is not as big as what they wanted, but allows them to stay "we have turned over evidence to federal prosecutors"		Nuance has no place in messaging
@Pcola_eddiet @foswi I don't know. Four examples from four different counties were sent out fed prosecutors.
@foswi I mention at bottom of the story. An FDP email is on the docs.
@foswi They forwarded me an email with FDP's general vote email on it. Does seem there is direct link, but none of this rises remotely to level that many have been alleging on TV and in other media.
Thank you for smoking https://t.co/oVmLPLK08Y
And, to be clear, I'm not at all media blaming. We have all been asking for days about fraud and if there are examples to match what has been alleged by many on the networks		DOS decided not to say this stuff was turned over to the feds until Tuesday. Why remains a mystery to me
So, while media across the country has been using the Department of State as example of an official entity saying nothing has been flagged related to Florida election, turns out DOS did flag some stuff, it just looks nothing like what has been described in public rhetoric
The docs were sent to Democratic voters. If they followed the instructions and turned in the fix for their VBM ballots by the date listed, their vote would not have counted. 		So, if it is what the documents imply, it's Democrats screwing up voter fraud (this last line is a joke)
DOS says the documents are tied to @FlaDems based on emails and other documents they released yesterday (again, three days after this stuff was sent to federal prosecutors). But, it's an odd bit of intentional election malfeasance, if that's what it is.
Department of State says documents used to fix screwed up mail ballots had wrong date on them. They were due by the Monday before election day, but some had dates changed to say that the deadline was the 8th, or after the election
It's first thing that has been flagged as far a law enforcement issue in Florida.		But it's not fraud/ballot stuffing/staff secretly filing out ballots, or any other thing that has been alleged public.
Without telling anyone publicly, last Friday Florida election officials sent examples of election documents with altered dates on them to federal prosecutors. They are asking them to investigate		https://t.co/c9Ig9qLmgn

@foswi I understand that. 		But both at the moment are not legal. If suing to ensure every vote is counted, should you sue to invalidate 150 laws already cast? In eyes of law currently, both methods not allowed.
