RT @vtg2: @TaiDecker @TaliaBuford @ProPublica @iarnsdorf @lenagroeger Article points to nuances in jobs created/saved/maintained over time/…
@TaiDecker @vtg2 @ProPublica @iarnsdorf @lenagroeger 3) the budget is not related to this story. This is an accounting of Trump's words and claims, and squaring that with what the companies themselves say is happening.
@TaiDecker @vtg2 @ProPublica @iarnsdorf @lenagroeger 1) To be clear, I didn't write the story. 2) Usually, people authorized to speak on behalf of the company's business answer calls from reporters. Same as I'm not authorized to speak on my company's biz matters, I'm sure a pipe fitter or welder would be similarly constrained.
@TaiDecker @vtg2 @ProPublica @iarnsdorf @lenagroeger Please continue. I am a former labor reporter and I covered pipelines in my previous jobs. The industry model for predicting jobs is imperfect -- induced, indirect, direct jobs are often conflated, as I'm sure you know. But I'm honestly interested to hear more of your analysis.
@TaiDecker @vtg2 @ProPublica @iarnsdorf @lenagroeger It's not narrow to use Trump's own words, official White House statements, interviews with each individual company, as well as union and state and local officials. Also not narrow to asking the White House to comment on the findings.

My dad: did you see all the people they’re getting rid of at the EPA? 	Me: yeah, like 700 people have left. We wrote that story. (Shoutout @ProPublica @marina_affo @derekkravitz @LFFriedman)	Dad: did you? I heard it on msnbc	Me: thanks dad 🙄
But shoutout to those workers. He really brightened up my day.
I don’t know. We still brush our teeth with bottled water at my house. And my mom refuses to cook with tap water. I expect that won’t change anytime soon.
I don’t know the answer. And haven’t talked to any official sources. My gut? Maybe this is what has to happen to build trust slowly? Ween people off of the bottles until you eventually get a city drinking out of the tap again?
As an outsider, I’m like, if the water is clean, why are there still giveaways? It doesn’t help instill confidence for me. Because my first thought is why would you give me water if my tap is good?
It was super easy, but also weird. I’ve been home a few days watching more local tv than is healthy. And I keep seeing these ads talking about how the water is clean. They have a fancy bar graphic and everything.
People at the water giveaway in Flint were so nice. I pulled up, gave them our address, they asked how many cases we wanted. Loaded 8 into my trunk and guy told me to have a marvelous day.
Mom gave me a new nightshirt with elephants balancing on balls and I couldn’t be happier right now. We enjoy outrageous animals in this household. https://t.co/MD3nS4XocE

@kenpaulman Dunno if they’ll have them or not - story didn’t explicitly say so though. Which was a concern.
@kenpaulman Yeah DC had cards. What was confusing is the story mentions debit, credit and Apple Pay. Not hard metro cards. That’s why I raised issue
RT @weact4ej: Thread from @TaliaBuford on why @SenBooker's introduction of an environmental justice bill matters. 👇🏾 https://t.co/8Jvwhhw3oR
@yourpalborno mmm. DC has a hard metro pass - which works - it's a permanent card and same sort of waveless technology. Doesn't work with apple pay tho.
Unclear if NYC will switch to metro cards like DC, but if it's only tied to phones &amp; debit/credit cards, that doesn't feel like a good idea https://t.co/hKkNUxbirZ
@yourpalborno the story, from my reading, didn't mention the switch to a card like WMATA or CTA etc. It did mention credit/debit and apple pay https://t.co/gziiLeixOp
@yourpalborno I'm unclear - that's what I was asking. It seemed they were using smartphones &amp; enhanced debit/credit. If there's another card, great.

@realDonaldTrump @SenBooker TLDR: Here why protections for vulnerable communities weren't written into law, which is why we're here today: https://t.co/auDQJ8qpVX
@realDonaldTrump @SenBooker Right now, it's still a Dem-led effort -- no GOP cosponsors are supporting the bill yet in the Senate or House, though it's still early
@realDonaldTrump @SenBooker It’s a big ask: Less ambitious bills in friendlier Congressional climates didn’t pass. So I'll be 👀 how this one fares with interest
@realDonaldTrump @SenBooker Title VI at EPA has had it's problems: https://t.co/vzdpIggFuW
@realDonaldTrump 2day, @SenBooker announced a bill to codify that EJ EO, protect NEJAC &amp; EJ grant programs &amp; allow citizens to sue under Title VI
@realDonaldTrump One big part of that was that environmental justice is largely a suggestion (via Exec Order 12898), rather than a mandate (by law)

@Dragonfly194 @LOLGOP @AJStream No. And that's been a point of contention among many people watching/dealing with the crisis.
@AJStream So yeah. Lots of things unprecedented about the water crisis. Including the involuntary manslaughter charges.
@AJStream MI is also nearly doubling its defense budget for officials/lawsuits from water crisis - from $4.5mil to $8.5mil: https://t.co/6WmQM9ZJiu
@AJStream Invol. mansl. charges aren't for the water contamination Flint residents were subjected to. There are other charges, but not these.
@AJStream ALSO: the invol mansl. charges are for Robert Skidmore, who died from Legionnaires disease during outbreak officials didn't tell public of
@AJStream The AG hasn't filed any charges against Gov. Snyder, and many think it's unlikely (though some residents say that's what is necessary)
@AJStream Experts: 1. jury may not be sympathetic to state officials, 2. company to take the fall would have to be Gov, 3. Charges may be negotiated
@AJStream Libby, BP, Chicago all had particular reasons that convictions didn't stick. Experts say there are reasons why Flint could break those molds
@AJStream After a 3 month trial, all were acquitted. (Fun fact: Libby has an ACA carve out that provides residents care: https://t.co/by64UJliNe)
@AJStream Allegations that W.R. Grace Co. knew vermiculite mines in town were contaminated with asbestos. Co. &amp; 7 execs indicted for knowing endang.
@AJStream In  Libby, MT., charge was not invol. mansl., but "knowing endangerment" = someone knows they're placing another in imminent deathly danger
@AJStream But! Conviction was thrown out on appeal. Why? A prior civil trial had failed to prove the captain was at fault. So again: no conviction
@AJStream Another case we examined was a 2005 explosion of a petroleum barge in the Chicago canal. The captain/owner was convicted of negligent mansl
@AJStream Who did take the invol manslaughter punishment? BP -- which paid $4bil in fines/penalties. But there was no indiv. convicted
@AJStream One supervisor plead to a misdemeanor Clean Water Act violation. The other took his chance in court and was cleared of any wrongdoing.
@AJStream But as the case wore on, DOJ said "circumstances had changed" and it couldn't prove the invol. manslaughter charges.
@AJStream DOJ initially charged two supervisors with numerous manslaughter charges for not telling anyone  initial tests showed the well was insecure
@AJStream And in cases where you do see charges, they're often dismissed. Take the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster for example.
@AJStream For enviro cases, it was similarly rare. The lawyers, academics and former gov't officials we talked to couldn't think of parallel cases.
@AJStream It's happened more often internationally than in the US. The @freep did a great piece on the novelty of US charges: https://t.co/oQlmcudosx
@AJStream Then we looked for  gov't officials charged w/manslaughter for not disclosing to the public something that caused them harm.
@AJStream So we tried to find the answer. We looked at a subset of cases -- environmental disasters to start.
First thing I thought when I heard of the Flint Water Crisis involuntary manslaughter charges: "will anyone actually go to jail?" @ajstream
RT @TaliaBuford: @AJStream @ProPublica After the Flint involuntary manslaughter charges, the first thing I thought was, "this is great, but…

What you go in looking for is what you will find @wvufoodjustice. Can sometimes reinforce bad narratives. Hold govt more accountable.
We don't report enough on these issues, says @wvufoodjustice. Reporting on snap and food aid can be judgmental bs about soda and nutrition.

What people want re: food security is under reported. The people are your best resources @KISRAwv
Engaging an audience doesn't mean you just take things from them.
Walk with me @HeberBrown
And guess what? The community you're reporting on has deadlines as well. Work around their schedules: their wk is important too @HeberBrown
.@HeberBrown honor my time. Do your research - not stuff that's on the FAQ page. I want to engage. That's more fun for everyone.
.@MDfoodmap: bring in other voices - don't just make academia the story. Everyone learns and you make better connections.
Be clear and honest in the angle you're pursuing with the community you're speaking with. Give them chance to honestly weigh in on biases

People want to talk. Just provide them with an avenue. @terryparrisjr
Things to remember when engaging with community @terryparrisjr https://t.co/e1brpMvQHb
Don't ignore people who participate! Your ask shouldn't be a transaction. This shouldn't be hard - make it warm and safe. @terryparrisjr
So, where do we start engaging communities? @terryparrisjr https://t.co/fxs8WZLvke
Is there an info gap you can fill:Sourcing? Data? Docs? Can community help? Is community harmed or ignored? Give them avenue @terryparrisjr
Newsletters create habit. Doesn't need to be daily or weekly. Think about 1 around beats. Curate monthly &amp; include callouts. @terryparrisjr
Use your voicemail to report and engage with community! WaPo project on being pulled over great example @terryparrisjr
Find things that are already highly engaged. Join them. And find what ppl are talking about. @terryparrisjr
You can also create your own community! Facebook groups you make - or existing ones you join - can allow you to engage w/ppl @terryparrisjr
Oh and after you fact check the letters? Reach back out to volunteers to share what you found. Use google docs to allow people to fill gaps.
Another way to engage? Ask community to help us with a task @terryparrisjr See: @ProPublica fact checking congress members on the ACA
Post your stories, answer questions in those groups.
How do you get 7k ppl to fill out a 40Q survey about agent orange? FB groups/pages are one way - find those communities; take survey to them
First @ProPublica call-out on Agent Orange wasn't a story - it was request to help us report this story by sharing experiences https://t.co/cv2UmQxDNo
Call outs on twitter - like this one -- work too https://t.co/UrIJyiWGUL
How do we engage communities? One way is to add email call outs at end of stories. Give ppl avenue to participate.
Ball::life as Engagement::Journalism.

.@JuliaJRH bring audience in early so you know you're serving them what you want - and the info they need in their lives.
.@JuliaJRH "questions are the atomic unit of all journalism" -- ask ppl what questions they have - not 4 story ideas. Qs are actionable

Who will I get to be my neighbors in the best house in all of DC if I don't live here?
Whose house will I stop over for quesadillas and champs if @ncindc doesn't live down the street?
Because as much as I love DC, it's my people I'm gonna miss the most.
Instead, I spent time smoking hookah with friends, eating delivery pizza with friends, catching up with friends, happy houring with friends
When I found I was leaving dc, I made plans to do stuff I'd miss. Touristy things. Those plans went to pot.
This city. The row houses. The traffic circles. The city grid. The memories. I did a lot of growing here.
DCA the GOAT
Grits and Biscuits. Eating actual biscuits at brunch with my faves.
Wine in grocery stores
Crunch at Metro Center and the yogis/fellow slackers there with me
Volunteering at SOME.
Snow Days! Thank you, federal govt, for shutting down at the first flurry so I can work in my pjs while Netflix keeps me company
Seeing legislators and agency officials at Costco. Realizing they are just regular people too.
Motorcades. Which while irritating, were also great reminders that we lived here
Being at inauguration or the Christmas Tree lighting or some other iconic American event but it feeling like a normal Tuesday b/c DC
All of the buskers and performers at Metro stations. I may not always donate, but I appreciate you.
I don't know their name, but the band that plays Sometimes in Farragut sq: their rendition of "love in top" always slays.
Threads, which kept my eyebrows on fleek
My hairstylist who kept my fro moisturized and sculpted.
Howard theater, 9:30 club, black cat, arena stage, Kennedy center, all the places I got my music and theater fixes here
Go-go (yes, fight me.)
Being able to ignore the crosswalk b/c I know it takes 15 seconds to walk across N.Capitol during rush hour &amp; I can make this light.
The circulator!
Knowing which side streets and alleys to take to avoid traffic.
Being @SorayaMcDonald 's plus one and reality check at movie screenings. And her bougie snacks.
My friends. My friends. My friends. My friends. My friends. My friends. My friends. My friends. My friends. My friends. My friends.
Cherry Blossoms. Random festivals on the Mall. Trips to the ends of the earth (aka Maryland and Virginia suburbs)
Also, RIP to Patty Boom Boom. 😢
Red toque. DUCCINI'S. Aroi Thai. All of my spots.
These views. The Mall. The Capitol in moonlight. SCOTUS. The House (penn ave, not GA ave)
The Post Hunt (rip), THE FREE MUSEUMS, Malcolm X drum circle, sneaking sangria into Malcolm X park, making elaborate snacks for friends
Summertime shenanigans with @JenifaTaughtMe.
Drinking in @ncindc's backyard/house. Trolling her with burgers with ketchup on them.
My backyard. Sunset Liquors (come thru w/Malbec and an inspirational quote). Drinking in my backyard.
DCity Smokehouse, Union Market, Bloomingdale farmers market, Marvin, Liv (rip), Tabaq (rip), Vinoteca, the 80 &amp; P6 buses, the Red Line (yes)
I've loved calling DC home. I'm gonna miss, in no particular order:
I picked these paint colors!
Since I've got a little time. I'm gonna miss my apartment so much. I've lived here for 7 years. Thrown parties here. Cried/Laughed here.

@marcowill emergency mail before the sunshine? Wtf are y'all all rushing to the mail for? It ain't snowing in La
But I did it. Y'all stay safe. It's starting to snow out there and you know DC loses its mind at the 1st flurry.
@kelseylh forget bread and milk. TP and wine is all you need apparently to ride out any storm
Also, I'm not fighting you over spinach. Just to be clear. Not today. Not ever.
I hate grocery stores before the snow. I like grocery shopping for things I want - not potentially fighting over the last bag of spinach.
But with the pending move and (successful) apartment hunting in NYC this weekend, my stockpiles were running low.
Which is why I'm disappointed in myself. My fridge is/was completely bare. I'm down to my last roll of toilet paper and my emergency roll
I'm usually phenomenally prepared. My freezer stays stocked with meats, sauces and chili. Come to my house and you will always be fed.
Ok. That was pain of my own making. Should have just explored. I'm done and out with my groceries. I'm making jambalaya.
Go up to self checkout. People, it's a regular line. Lesson learned. Question is, once I check out do I go tell everyone else?
Wait. The line I was in was for one register. We thought someone was directing it from there. No. Me &amp; the girl next to me decide to be bold
Let me tell you why I'm particularly disappointed in myself for being in the grocery store on snow eve:
Other popular item: wine.
Just gonna tweet through it.
You can't tell. I need to be up to the pharmacy sign to even get to a register. Meanwhile, line stretches at least 30 ppl behind me. https://t.co/07vK2HvdBz
Looking at people's baskets. There's a lot of pasta going on.
Miscalculation costs too great. Go investigate, come back to find your place ain't saved. End up at the back of line near the dairy. #Nope
This is when I need a boyfriend/husband/roommate shopping with me. I need someone to investigate but can't lose my place. 😩
The line at Harris Teeter is off the chain. We don't even know where we are going. Just hopped in line and praying we make it to a register

@dariusss because NYers carry that in their wallets instead of their glove compartments? Wtf. I had to get my insurance co to fax it in.
@dariusss they asked me for my registration and proof insurance. When my car was already impounded.
@dariusss is it just once a week? That's like D.C. Irritating. But doable. I thought it was every other day. I got towed once. To BK Navy Yd

I'm not built for the suburbs. (Though, I do miss a good store parking lot on occasion)
Anyway, that's what my gut was telling me as I expanded my apartment search to Harlem, and then restricted it back to Brooklyn.
@Brittany_Geneva I'm positive it is! It's. Just. So. Far. Away.
@sarahcnyt I never understood why my sister hated the thought of Harlem. It's because it's a solid hour on the train. Not worth it to her.
I wonder if the Bronx has silly things like ABC stores.
ABC stores were the nusiance of my college experience. And Virginia just has them. I want to buy my liquor whenever I want it.
The suburbs were just far for no reason. And not near trains. And requires expensive Ubers. And have you been to VA? They have ABC stores.
ask any of my friends and they will tell you the fits I've pitched over the suburbs. I existed in DC. I embraced it.
I've been in DC for 7 years. I HAVE A CAR. I'm from Michigan. And yet....
And in my crude NY map, Harlem is Baltimore/Maryland; and the Bronx/Queens are Virginia.
I'm allergic to suburbs.
...A friend. Explain how Harlem being an hour from my sis is like her living in Baltimore while I'm in DC. And then it all clicks.
