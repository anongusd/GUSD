#AHSApocalpyse Don't the writers know that the people want more @billyeichner ??
#AHSApocalpyse live stream Don't the writers know that viewers want more @billyeichner ???
#AHSApocalpyse WE finally did it ???? Hummmmmm.....
#AHSApocalpyse pls live @billyeichner Why did you run so slow!
@realDonaldTrump You are the worst human being.
@KathrynDennis Support you and thank you.
@AsaSoltan Oh, I CAN'T Stop watching, but your absence confirms your grounding and soulful peace. You are too much zen for drama.
@NeNeLekes @KenyaMoore @EvaMarcille @PhaedraParks What NeNe says goes. Period Bitches.
#RHOC you don't dress in a gown and huge jewels for a place that serves fish tacos and ribs.
#realhousewivesoforangecounty something isn't right when u go 2 dinner wearing a beautiful dress and huge jewels, then order fish tacos\salmon bowl and your husband orders ribs.
@RHOGossip Yes!
@timnelson_mpr Are we sure that's the same raccoon??? I smell a conspiracy.
@SophRossss @JLJeffLewis She got paid and was hired through a service. It wasn't a favor.
@JLJeffLewis There's no problem with the word "use".The "job" should hv no emotional connection + weren't the comments used in the interview portion, not during delivery? &amp; her face &amp; vaja were never in camera during the birthing. She wants money. She sure loved camera time during pregnancy!
#mprraccoon please save! Window washers!!! What do we need to do to save him???
@NBCNews @realDonaldTrump proves to be a horrible soul. Another teachable moment he has given me to explain to my two 2 young boys that people in power are not always role models. You @realDonaldTrump are destruction, narcissistic, and a predator.
@Bethenny Universal, no doubt. It is the new level of fun, excitement for an 8 yr old. Disney is too tame.
@DarrenCriss @MrRPMurphy @ACSFX @DarrenCriss I got so lost in the episodes that I just came to realize that YOU aren't dead. You absolutely deserve an Emmy.
@stitchfix I never got anything that cute!
@RHOGossip @Bravotv please fire @vgunvalson!
@LoveAndyC @bravotvobsessed I'm so over @vgunvalson.
@DorindaMedley I wish there was an @DORlNDAMEDLEY show. I could watch her for an hour going about her day. Totally entertaining, the best.
@RHOGossip Yes, please be true! Love, love @KimZBiermann. Beautiful and real.

@TeddiMellencamp Boring-anything but.  You are the best and the "Real" of housewives.
@bravotvobsessed No.
@Variety Love.
@ramonaaaaxo @grantswilson @Jchawes @stevegonsalves1 @davetango Wednesday was the best day of the week. Miss #Ghosthunters
@MarkWarner @united2026 Really, this is your focus? Embarrassed for you all.
@RHOGossip Please, please , I hope this isn't fake news.
@etnow Because her job is to have a 24" waste. She doesn't have a normal life.
@NBCThisisUs I don't want this amazing season to end, but I'm emotionally drained and I'm running out of anxiety medication. These writers, actors and crew=MAGIC #THISISUS
@ConanOBrien @ConanOBrien of course, it's her right shark.
@Realitytea Please NO.
@amybruni Went there to explore bc of your GH episode.	Guides there say they don't really experience anything. Why are u going? Your amazing talents are needed in homes where lives are affected.
@Bravotv Actually I never thought there was an option to not renew. My world seems darker and uncertain knowing that Andy may not always be with me.
@robkardashian You are taking the high road. Good Dad and you should be proud.
@KyleRichards I'm the OG of the BH &amp; I don't deal with anyone's BS.
@Bethenny can you please share a simple, clean salad dressing recipe that a 6 yr. old would eat?
@Bethenny Prayers and strength
@jimmykimmel I truly believe that you helped save health care for me and my 2 boys. Thank you.
RT @SenJohnMcCain: I cannot in good conscience vote for Graham-Cassidy. A bill impacting so many lives deserves a bipartisan approach. httpâ€¦

@realDonaldTrump #shutyourmouthTrump you are playing with my childrens' lives. N. Korea and Health Care, killing us.	#MommaBearsAgainstTrump
@jimmykimmel @SenJohnMcCain Both @jimmykimmel and @SenJohnMcCain Thank you for fighting for me and my two boys.
@RobLowe couldn't wait for Wood Ape episode, but found the Outsider moment INCREDIBLE.

@BravoWWHL @SethMacFarlane @MarthaStewart What does Martha think of her cooking show being used as prime evidence &amp; included in  Scott's alibi testimony in the Laci Peterson case?
@BravoWWHL What does Martha think of her cooking show being used as evidence &amp; Scott's alibi  in the timeline of Laci Peterson's death?
@KrisJenner yet you can't make that comment for him on the interview?  #only wife w no comment.
@BruceJennerFans You are a champion for so many souls and you have again become an American hero. Live your life in happiness.
