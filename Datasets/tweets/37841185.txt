@JakeSherman @sahilkapur Can we at least all agree that there's nothing quite as exciting as a ::drum roll:: conference committee?!
@JakeSherman I disagree. I would argue the ~30 Democrats who won in Trump districts (who are Pelosi's "majority makers") matter.
If you think for a minute this means the President is giving up on securing our border, you are sorely mistaken. This is giving Congress a shot to solve this thru the legislative process once &amp; for all.
The conference committee has a real chance to work out a long-term solution. When rank-and-file Members of Congress get together behind closed doors &amp; work towards a bipartisan policy end that’s based on the needs of the nation, not winning the cable news war, real results come.
President Trump absolutely did the right thing today. Leadership requires willingness to compromise. He gave Congress one more shot to solve the real crisis at our border in a bipartisan manner.

Never thought I’d say this, but good for DWS. 🇺🇸 https://t.co/MbPpimR98Z
My new fav: “we don’t need a wall because they’re building tunnels” so u concede there’s a sophisticated criminal effort to exploit our border but your answer is we shouldn’t make it any harder to come above ground &amp; u haven’t proposed any $ to destroy tunnels? We shd do nothing?
It also only logically follows that if cartels are attempting to smuggle drugs through ports of entry, they’re also trying (we know they are) to bring them thru vast, unmanned, parts of the border w/ no wall/physical barrier
That’s making republicans point for them. Physical barriers &amp; stronger personnel enforcement works. That’s also precisely why Pres. Trump’s budget request asks for more funding for technology, infrastructure, &amp; personnel at ports of entry &amp; beyond
Some observations on Dems border talking pts: they claim we don’t need a wall because the majority of drugs are caught at ports of entry. Yes - the majority of drugs that WE CATCH coming across border are caught at a physical, manned barrier, which ports of entry are

Make no mistake, DPRK’s Director of Propaganda -  Kim Yo-Jong - will return to a nation as oppressive as it was when she left it for the Olympics.
The bizarre implication of these pieces is that the mere act of standing for the unified Korean Olympic teams would have somehow reversed decades of oppression, corruption, &amp; tyranny in North Korea.

Republicans need to be wary of not falling into the trap of no longer caring about debts &amp; deficits when there's an R in the WH
Under Obama, Repubs fought for Cut, Cap, &amp; Balance &amp; No Budget No Pay -- most wouldn't have ever support a clean debt ceiling increase
HFC &amp; RSC offered more than 1/2 a dozen spending reforms ranging from minor regulatory tweaks to mandatory $ cuts to get to yes on debt hike
The Freedom Caucus came out in May against debt hike w/out spending cuts or reforms. We also called for working thru recess to find deal
Few thoughts: The Trump-Pelosi-Schumer deal isn't a good deal 4 GOP. But neither was clean debt hike thru 2018 the Hill was going to pass
@NoahCRothman The group never called for immediate offsets for disaster relief. There wasn't enough time. All but 2 members supported Harvey aid w/out
@NoahCRothman Senate was going to vote by week's end on clean debt hike tied to Harvey. So yeah more time as in like 36 hours... ?
@JoeNBC @WSJ WSJ Ed board &amp; you claimed Freedom Caucus rejected a better deal. Deal was clean debt hike with 0 conservative wins. We offered 5+ options
@NoahCRothman The legislature shouldn't wait on POTUS to legislate. Also deal was cooked with Senate to add clean debt hike  prior to yesterday's WH mtg
*wonders what went wrong in her life that she's rage tweeting at Joe Scarborough* 🙋🏻🇺🇸

@MEPFuller better. You raise fair points. A lot more Q's have to be answered before final passage.
@dougstafford @MEPFuller agreed. Most of HFC would happily admit the process stunk.
@MEPFuller My pt: u know Sanford well enough to know he doesn't blindly support policy he hasn't read, analyzed &amp; understood. Plenty MOCs do, he doesnt
@MEPFuller 1) It will be scored be4 he ever votes on final passage  2) He has a Milliman study on its impact, 3) that cd literally be said for any bill

Massie is right. (as usual!) It's not a full repeal of Obamacare, as stated in HFC's statement on position. https://t.co/tJbba0FEUC
Wrong. States can only be granted waiver by HHS if they establish high risk pools to cover preexisting conditions https://t.co/j7FsCgD1mv
NEWS: Freedom Caucus announces official position of support for AHCA with MacArthur amendment included
@EricBanta it allows states to opt out of the cost-driving insurance regulations
