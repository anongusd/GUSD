Have fun scrambling around to pick apart Cohen's testimony and digging into Trumps taxes and running through statements made on the campaign and such. I'm over that. You do that and I'll wait ahead for you. I'm on that Mueller Mindset level. No, I don't care what you have to say.
Cohen warns Republicans Trump will bring them down with him if they keep following him blindly like he had been for 10+ years.
Nuclear talks break-down in Vietnam and no deal is reached. There was never a "deal" in the first place so pretty much Trump had a nice vacation to beautiful Vietnam. He also seems to have had a nice dinner with Jong Un. Isn't that nice.
Trump responds in Vietnam to Cohen testimony: said he watched it but not much because he "was busy"...says Cohen "lied a lot" but likes how he said there was "no collusion"...
I made it to the other side.

This whole thread started because twitter trolls were trolling the first Somali-American in Congress who happens to be a Muslim woman. I was like: "Fine. Let me take a look at what she said and what this whole "controversy" is about"...I feel for @IlhanMN, she's being targeted.

Republicans are now bringing politics into this matter.

Whitaker is clearly dodging yes or no questions from Nadler on if he shared any info with Trump or any other WH official.
asked about being briefed on SCO or other criminal matters Whitaker replies, "Yes, I have" but is noticeably anxious. Says disclosing how many times he has been briefed is something he doesn't wanna disclose during an "ongoing investigation"

"Patel circulated an internal memo last November urging Nunes to hold top officials at the Justice Department and the FBI in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over documents related to the Obama administration’s alleged use of the dossier to surveil Trump associates."
"Kash Patel read the highly classified intelligence it’s based on (something the Justice Department indicates Nunes has not done), drafted the memo, and then dealt with FBI and Justice Department efforts to keep it from being released to the public."

I think its stupid to paint your face in any circumstance. lol
its not good look for anyone to paint their face black or brown actually.
FYI: its not a good look to paint your face black or brown if you're white. other colors such as orange, green, or blue are acceptable. But not black. Unless you're going to a Steelers game, I guess. I dunno.
The question remains: Where is the footage of Ralph Northam winning a dance contest dressed up as Michael Jackson in blackface doing the moonwalk.
Northam says if you go through the yearbook there are "multiple photos of people in blackface." He said that.
Northam says the nickname "coonman" was a name referred to him by a couple of people and doesn't know why it ended up in the yearbook and what their "intent" was.
Northam also says it "could have been a mistake" that the photo ended up on a page with him in it. I repeat, he dressed up as "Michael Jackson" in a talent show and he won.
To clarify Northam was in a "talent show" and didn't think it was offensive at the time. I repeat, he won the competition because he "did the moonwalk" well.
Northam says, he dressed up as, after asking his wife to recall the name, "Michael Jackson"and put "polish on his face" for a dance competition. He "won the dance concert" he says because he was able to "do the moonwalk" well.
Northam is confident that he is not in the photo and says it was the "first time he saw the photo" because he didn't "buy the yearbook".
RT @maggieNYT: Northam now appears to be trying to get ahead of other damaging stories, says he once "darkened his face" as Michael Jackson…

Oh, castles	Some people so lonely, what good is a castle	Surrounded by people?	But ain't got a friend that's not on the payroll	Oh, and I don't care what they bring	They can have everything	They can't afford what we've got	Not even the king	https://t.co/roHDZBpd7o
