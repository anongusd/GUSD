The Judiciary Committee has started acting like a body of senators. Thank you, @JeffFlake for pushing compromise.
@senorrinhatch The Democrats are not responsible for #Kavanaugh ‚Äòs belligerence, paranoia about a Clinton-connected conspiracy theory, or his treatment of the women on the committee. Before yesterday, I believed the nominee had the temperament of a judge, respected women, &amp; could rule fairly.
@thehill I get @LindseyGrahamSC used to be a trial lawyer, and the strategy is to blame the victim. But is it necessary to spew venom on everyone who disagrees? If I were on the committee, my vote would be based solely on the temperament,  hostility &amp; partisanship exhibited yesterday.
@mkraju I wish the committee would base their votes on current temperament, ability to represent ‚Äúboth tribes,‚Äù &amp; an attitude toward women, rather than what happened in 1982.
I don‚Äôt believe @JeffFlake has fully rolled over. If he ponders #Kavanaugh‚Äôs comments on a conspiracy &amp; how the judge acted at yesterday‚Äôs hearing especially toward female senators, Sen. Flake might rethink his vote. Issues are integrity &amp; temperament ‚Äî not behavior 35 years ago.
@LindseyGrahamSC If @SenFeinstein @amyklobuchar @KamalaHarris  or @maziehirono had acted yesterday like you &amp; Judge #Kavanagh, GOP senators would consider them unhinged, hysterical &amp; unfit for their posts. To hell with what Dems did or didn‚Äôt do, your &amp; his temperament are grounds to vote ‚Äúno.‚Äù

@SenatorCollins Thanks to you &amp; other senators who stood up. I prefer for the hearing to be private - to avoid another Anita Hill situation. Based on older senators convicting the woman before hearing her story, I fully expect she will be smeared, which is why most women never come forward.
@USAGSessions @Comey Have you gone senile? The timing of Comey‚Äôs announcement that the email probe was reopened was a primary reason she lost. Yes, @Comey really wanted to help HRC ‚Äî Not.
This seems like a bogus - planted? - story. Why is it a bombshell that Page says the FBI found no collusion before Mueller was appointed? Wasn‚Äôt the point of the probe for an objective actor to find out? What does that have to do with what‚Äôs known now? https://t.co/tdvJCHKQGH

@rushlimbaugh You can make your  conservative points without sexual and racial slurs. There is no excuse. You go too far with hate talk.
@IngrahamAngle You're grown and a public person -- not a young, impressionable law student. Ed was suspended and apologized. No parallel.
@plove360  BTW, Both Ed & Imus showed remorse and apologized. I'm not sure about Maher. I wasn't watching him at the time.
@plove360 No one campaigned Ed's sponsors because MSNBC took action. On HBO, Maher doesn't have sponsors. MSNBC fired Imus due to an uproar
@plove360 Actually, there was an uproar. MSNBC suspended Ed & considered firing him. There's no excuse for either side to use that term.

John McCain may be toast but the GOP isn't above stealing elections. Think Florida and Ohio. Obama's win must be a landslide to hold.
More scary than ACORN: Machine in WV county appears fixed for McCain. http://wvgazette.com/News/200810170676
@treesearcher: I'm a mainstream Christian and support the 2nd Amendment. I'm liberal. Don't stereotype me, and I won't stereotype you.
Appointing Gov. Palin is a slap to the faces of women. Sen. Biden is more of a feminist than the winking moose-hunter....
Neither McCain nor Palin is a racist, but both are lying and will do anything to win including smearing a great statesman.
I've already made reservations in Arlington for the inauguration.
If McCain had put "Country First" he wouldn't have chosen Palin. She makes W look like a genious.
I've got news for neocons: Liberal is no longer a four-letter word! Liberal's can't do any worse than the Bush administration.
Rep. Bachmann thinks news media investigate whether members of Congress are pro- or anti-American. Does anyone remember Joe McCarthy?
@saveourcountry: John McCain hangs around with G. Gordon Liddy. How's that for guilt by association. Can we blame McCain for Watergate?
Watching Rep. Bachmann on TV. She thinks liberals have anti-America views. I think of the Kennedys and how they gave 3 sons to America.
Is the voter fraud controversy actually the GOP preparing to contest new voters to reduce Obama's lead?
My 80-year-old aunt got a McCain robo call. She was leaning toward McCain, now plans to support Obama.
Has it occurred to any of you McCaniacs that there's nothing else Obama can tell? If he'd been hiding his past, why admit to cocaine use?
McCain complains Obama will spread the wealth around. Go Obama!
Joe isn't a plumber, would benefit from Obama's tax plan. http://tinyurl.com/6c5zcx
Joe the Plumber is really a contractor. Why am I not surprised?
Ayers. So what? ACORN. So what? Joe the Plumber? So what? My losing thousands from 401k. That's what!
CNN & MSNBC need to coordinate Palin speech coverage. Showing her on both channels simultaneously is cruel & unusual punishment to viewers.
John McCain at the Roast is the one I remember before he sold his soul to Karl Rove's cronies. He was charming and genuinely funny.
WV welcomes Barack's campaign. Mountain Mamas love Obama!
@donlemoncnn: Obama in a heartbeat, although McCain performed better than he did in the last two debates. McCain's just so condescending.
@JosephBiden: If you come to WV or send President Clinton a couple of times  you can turn our state blue too. Come down and see us!
Bob Schieffer did the best job of moderating. He kept them on task and got them to talk face to face.
@ozten: McCain's health care plan was criticized because it sucks!
Obama is the next FDR. Hoover leaves office Jan. 20, 2009.
Why would anyone even consider voting for someone who wants to tax health care benefits?
Silliest moment: McCain defending Palin as better than Biden. God help us all!
McCain did the best he's done in a debate. Too bad for him it's too little too late. The big Mo is for Obama. Barack is just way to cool!
McCain just seems to have so much contempt for Obama. I think, "How can he create bipartisanship that will get America back on track?"
I hope Joe the Plumber is on Saturday night live.
@dpeterson329: It's the GOP that's taken over the banks.
The Maverick Code of Conduct: It's OK to yell fire in a crowded movie theater.
Maverick Code of Conduct: It's OK to ursurp your authority as governor and say you were exonerated.
Obama will take WV, Biden predicts: http://wvgazette.com/News/200810140658
@sockrebel: Congrats. Tell Barack to send Biden and The Clintons to WV.
Charles Barkley should run for office!
The paranoia about Obama is bizarre. None of the charges is substantiated except Rev. Wright but Palin lives in a glass house on that one.
West Virginia is now considered a toss-up by USA today and Real Politics. Obama signs are popping up.
If Obama and Ayers are friends, so what?
Both of the candidates meet Constitutional requirements to run for office. Can't we just move on?
Palin stopped in West Virginia today for 24 minutes, got booed by protesters.
Obama can't be the anti-Christ. He's leaving office Jan. 20, 2009.
@NObama4thisMama: We recognize GOP talking points. We don't need a review.
@donlemoncnn: I'm as white as snow and John Lewis is right as rain. Wallace's campaign and MLK's assassination occurred in the same year.
@NObama4thisMama. People give you answers on Obama but your mind is closed tight. Good night and good luck....
@NObama4thisMama. Maybe we should rehash Keating Five for awhile? He's running. Or Palin's abuse of power?
@NObama4thisMama: He gives us hope that tomorrow will be better!
@NObama4thisMama: Are you reading McCain-Palin talking points off a sheet of paper?
Get the facts on ACORN: http://tinyurl.com/4nz2ou
@Nobama4thismama: Do you make more than $250,000? No. Well Obama's tax plan won't hurt a bit....
I'm voting for Obama Oct. 15 -- first day I can in my state.
I served on a Board with someone who got arrested for drug possession. Does that make the rest of us guilty?
@Obamawho: Comparing Obama and Powell shows race is an issue.
MomJones51@mytowntalks: When someone incites people to scream "terrorist" and "kill him," that's inciting hate!
McCain defended Obama but his campaign continues to incite hate. If he can't control his campaign, how can he lead America?
I call Obama a man of great courage since he's risking his life for change!
I'm more scare of the hate being incited by McCain-Palin than I ever could be of Obama.

No coincidence.
McCain-Palin are scarier than a hornet's nest!
McCain's campaign has crossed the line. http://tinyurl.com/5y8lke
You guys trashing Obama: I hope you are held to the same standard in which you are judged by all the folks you ever associated with.
I love Obama. I'm going to bed. Good nite!
In all seriousness, if McCain has an ounce of decency he will stop the hate mongering and control his campaign!
Obama has eloquent speech. He must be a terrorist!
Obama has a grin. He must be up to something!
Obama gives us hope. He must be flawed!
The ghost of Mayor Daily supports Obama!
Obama hung out with Ho Chi Minh when he was 5!
