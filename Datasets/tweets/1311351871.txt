It’s 1 thing to have watched the dirty-play all through 2016 and pro-R changes to party platform, but it’s obvious now that it’s not just our POTUS who’s been compromised, but a significant portion of the political party in power. What now? https://t.co/k30VzNcHm6
@RandPaul Since 2016; many of us watched with eyes wide open
@MSNBC I can’t believe what I’m listening to.  These so-called conservative “talking points “ or”narratives” are obvious cover-ups.  Trump HAD to follow through, begrudgingly, with sanctions; BS he’s tougher than any on Russia when he continuously acts on Putin’s behalf.
