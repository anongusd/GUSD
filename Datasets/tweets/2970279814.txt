It‚Äôs disrespectful to the service and time federal employees devote to our country. Time has come for us reopen the government and leave debate  for border security to regular order.
Using hundreds of thousands of federal workers ‚Äì including members of the @USCG working on the Great Lakes, and @TSA  &amp; @CBP agents keeping  airports, borders safe ‚Äì as pawns is no way to run the government.
Every single Democrat agrees keeping our nation secure is our number one  priority. Let‚Äôs debate in Congress, on the floor and in committee, the best ways to keep our borders secure.
As this unnecessary shutdown continues, the President needs to show leadership by reopening the government.
Merry Christmas and happy holidays to everyone celebrating! John and I send best wishes for a joyful day spent with loved ones.
The American people expect their government to work for them and listen.  It‚Äôs the holiday season, we should be showing America our better selves not driving the nation into a pointless shutdown.
A government shutdown is unacceptable. It‚Äôs a lack of leadership from President Trump and Republican Congressional Leaders.

Today‚Äôs MDEQ report highlights the need for EPA to set one national protective standard for the entire class of PFAS chemicals.
Many in our community have questions about PFAS and its presence in our waters. Michigan has been hit hard, and this chemical is a threat to human health and our environment wherever it is found, whether in drinking water, air, food, or consumer products.
Action on #climatechange can't wait and the Trump Administration has set us back decades. We need bold ideas. Excited to discuss a Green New Deal and looking forward to working on @EnergyCommerce to pass meaningful climate legislation.

Congress has taken a small step to give employees on Capitol Hill a transparent and fair process for reporting sexual harassment claims. This is just the first of many much-needed reforms to ensure that workplaces across the country are safe and inclusive for all workers.

For the third time, the House has shut down debate by quietly sneaking it into a procedural vote. Today, House members received an update from military and diplomatic officials. Families in my hometown are telling me about horrific conditions.
The ongoing war in Yemen has caused endless suffering and is a serious humanitarian crisis. The decision to send the military to war is perhaps one of Congress‚Äô greatest responsibilities. The Senate is having the debate the House should also be having.

To ask God to bring them safely to the place where they long to be, and to always show kindness to strangers and those in need. To support and help the work of those seeking to bring them relief.
They taught me to look with mercy on those who are fleeing from danger. To watch over migrants, refugees and asylum seekers, those separated from their loved ones, those who are lost and those who have been exiled from their homes.

There is a trend developing. Mr. Zuckerberg needs to either address this issue publicly or Congress needs to invite him back to address this in person. We need to hold more hearings on these issues and should pass legislation to improve trust between platforms and users.
The fact that this practice was allowed to continue for years shows that the value companies place on our privacy is monetary - not moral. Facebook has a massive reach and an even larger responsibility to do what is right by their customers.
In his testimony before Congress Mr. Zuckerberg didn‚Äôt use the word transparency once ‚Äì now we know why.  We didn‚Äôt sign up for Facebook to let outside companies collect our and our friends' relationship status and private messages. https://t.co/O7X36uAm3p
