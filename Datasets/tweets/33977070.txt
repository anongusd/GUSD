The political bias clearly shown during the investigation &amp; double standard of justice was rampant &amp; deliberate. This is the same crooked group at FBI that started the investigation of President Trump that led to the appointment of Special Counsel Mueller  https://t.co/81rjlbIUzY

GET THIS--We don’t actually know how long #SNAP recipients are on the program. We believe these benefits are temporary, but we have no comprehensive data to prove that. The #2018FarmBill will begin collecting #SNAP data to better inform future policy. #AL03 #Ag
#SNAP asset tests haven’t been updated since the 1970s. The #2018FarmBill modernizes and enforces these asset tests to incentivize employment.  #Ag #AL03

The #2018FarmBill makes investments in rural broadband and authorizes USDA to help address the opioid crisis and establishes a U.S.-only animal vaccine bank to help strengthen #ruralAmerica. #Ag #AL03
We enjoy the safest, most affordable &amp; most abundant food supply in world largely due to sustained public investment in #agresearch. #2018FarmBill maintains funding for research, extension &amp; land grant universities, specialty crops &amp; organic research. #AL03 #Auburn #Tuskegee

Brock and she has even said so herself.  President Trump has long warned about how the liberal media uses FAKE NEWS. Now we are seeing in Alabama.  #AL03
around lies that just foment hatred and further divide our country.  I am also disappointed in any reporter who has taken the bait and tries to make a story out of something that never happened.   Even Congresswoman Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon (R-PR) knew it was a joke directed at
without an accent.”  It is crystal clear that it was a joke directed at Brock because he and I both have similar accents from the South.  A joke that we are the ones that don’t have an accent and everyone else does.  It is disgusting that these radical liberal groups are pushing
in the State of Alabama.  I have known Brock a long time in Alabama and actually had breakfast with him and my colleagues before the Homeland Security Full Committee hearing last week.  My opening remarks directed at Brock Long were, “Mr. Long, it is refreshing to have a witness
FAKE NEWS is what this all boils down to.  Extremist liberal groups like Latino Rebels, who claim to ‘cause trouble’, take an innocent conversation and try turn it into something it was not.
