@Chucktowndoc Onlinemeded has an excellent lecture series over medical stats
@ErinGarrettMD I didn’t know what to expect, but I actually really enjoyed it! I liked how there was so much going on at once. Everyone dissecting, weighing, measuring, grossing, etc... definitely sensory overload!
Saw my first (and second) autopsy this week! ~(˘▾˘~)  (~˘▾˘)~
@pathologistmag (I’m sorry that this is all out of order)
@pathologistmag awesome things about path that physicians &amp; med students just don’t know about. I personally think that path should be a required, 2 week course at q med school. There’s no telling how many people would go into the field if they just had a chance to see what it’s all about. 6/6
@pathologistmag To yell to the entire world how important pathology is! Every pathologist I’ve worked with lights up when talking about how much they actually LOVE pathology as a field of medicine. Non-path physicians and medical students need to know that’s what you think!! There are so many 5/
@pathologistmag personal relationship with the physician I would ask what they thought pathologists did all day, and more often than not the response was “autopsies”. That just isn’t the case. I think the biggest issue for path, as a medical student, is never coming out from behind the scenes 4/
@pathologistmag of going into it because I’m “too outgoing.” I found that to be incredibly discouraging. I was never questioned by non-pedi physicians when I said I wanted to be a pediatrician, so it was kind of shocking that all of a sudden my personal choice was being challenged. If I had a 3/
@pathologistmag to the field. I had no idea what it was or what pathologists even did before that elective. I switched from pedi to path and finished up my clerkships having to explain and defend myself to other physicians. Sadly, more than a handful of non-path docs have tried to talk me out 2/
@pathologistmag I was 100% convinced that I would become a pediatrician from as far back as elementary school... I liked pedi during clerkships and enjoyed my electives in it. If I had not been randomly placed in a 2 week elective so early my 3 year, I would have NEVER even been exposed to 1/
I knew path was right for me after someone (very politely generalizing an entire field) told me that pathologists were all.... *long pause*.... a little off. 		Pathologist of Twitter, would you agree?? 		#path #pathology #medschool #pathologist

@health_advising @sacjai That’s what I was thinking!! My FIVE year old niece learned breathing techniques and yoga in her PE class in KINDERGARTEN!! (In a small town near Waco, Texas.)

@business and other local places. It just seemed off, especially in comparison to google reviews. Now I have found myself using Yelp much less and I think this may be why. 3/3
@business bars, stores, gyms, dry cleaning, things to do, realtors, apartments, literally EVERYTHING. I noticed something was off in 2018 when it kept recommending taco trucks and places like Chili’s when I searched for “tex mex restaurants” when it used to list Chuy’s and El Tiempo 2/
@business As a huuuge user (but not reviewer) of Yelp in large metro areas in Texas (mostly Austin and Houston), I have definitely noticed something being “off” with Yelp over the past year. I used to use Yelp reviews 5-10 times a week for dog groomers, restaurants, hair salons, parks, 1/
