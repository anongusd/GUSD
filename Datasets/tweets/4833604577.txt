Federal taxes do wonderful things including defends our country, provides healthcare to seniors,	 and low income Americans, reduce student loan debt, rebuilds infrastructure, and can reduce the one trillion dollar per year federal deficit. https://t.co/XHBHWHGy5s

The Republican Party is  Now Working to Gut Your Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid &amp; Other Programs by Using the Recent 1.7 Trillion Dollar Tax Cut to Do It (Mitch McConnel Oct 19, 2018 / 11:40 AM)!
@JoshConstine @SpinDr Take all the air on the planet it's 20  mile thin skin of air Put it in a giant balloon and it would be about the size of Australia. Do the math yourself  - Lots of Earth but really not much air to pollute.

@BillGates @RayDalio To Bill Gates and the other 560 American billionaires i suggest you join the other billionaires in fighting the Koch brothers and the  Mercer's or are you going to lose all your billions through a peaceful revolution in this country. End your silence now!
@Thom_Hartmann After 34 years of work as a political activist I conclude that the only way to get substantial improvements for the working class is direct against the robber baron billionaires. Billionaires now own most Republicans some Democrats and all mainstream media plus the Supreme Court!
In reference to Robert Mercer. On Long Island New York they want to rename the Stony Brook University School of Medicine the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook. I think it would be better to rename a landfill after the Mercers rather than a hospital.
@EdRomaine Brookhaven T own Supervisor Ed Romaine needs to fix his Law Department NOW!  Most are needlessly dragged to court unnecessarily and treated like cattle to be milked and bled for money and devoured with a plea bargain threat of a criminal record please!  Ed fix it NOW!

@SpeakerRyan The tax reform plan is historic 4 hard-working American families alright historically bad!!!
It's been said that  absolute power and absolute money corrupts absolutely!
American people and the people of the world for that matter need to create a consciousness that billionaires are not Heroes but robber barons!
I view Trump supporters like I view Bernie Madoff investors. It sounded real nice but in reality it was fraud, lies, snake oil and a real very artful con job.
It's not easy to do, but I work to be kind to Trump supporters because we may need their vote for a progressive in the next presidential election.
