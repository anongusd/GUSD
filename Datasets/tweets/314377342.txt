@JuneSummer1 @johncusack Amen sister! Anybody who thinks African Americans are too weak to stand on their own two feet isn't a friend. They're a wolf in sheep's clothing and want one thing from you, you're being. It's a form of modern-day slavery. That's why I'll never vote democrat, on principle.
@jean_yoon @TheView I love that even as Republicans and Democrats still hate each other, can all basically come together and denounce socialism and Bernie. It's great.
RT @Llorac11: Best thing this morning is #NeverBernie is trending.
Watching Democrats and Republicans basically all agree that Bernie Sanders is a POS is great. Finally, something we can agree on. #NeverBernie
Bernie, attacking President Trump will not allow you to win in 2020. Do not be mistaken, he will eat you alive no matter what happens. Don't play the same game as him, because I can bet almost none of you will win. I very much hope so, anyway. #NeverBernie

Just like Hillary Clinton. @BernieSanders, we don't want your socialized world view at the executive stage. Hell no, fuck no, just no in general. Keep your old white man hands to yourself. No thanks, rich white man who wants socialism because it wouldn't hurt himself. https://t.co/YcGJ0NXJMU

@J_A_Moulton @chescaleigh So basically, this is just common sense type stuff. With a fancy title? I feel like most people would get behind it this kind of thing if it were pushed as common sense and not "checking privilege." Maybe I'm wrong. Some of the things we've seen in videos seems crazy out there.
If this occurred, he should not have placed his hands on the media person. This just further carries their narrative that Trump Supporters are potentially violent. This is indeed not the truth because I know a lot of us aren't. It just takes one example though. Be careful, y'all. https://t.co/QXSAhv3rdI

@cynthia_spinney @Burghgirl69 @fr4ctals @jiveDurkey @NBCNews I disagree. I believe he's brought back politics the way they used to be. That's a good thing. We should debate politics harshly but calmly and carefully. He has demonized illegal immigrants, especially criminals who have harmed others.
@J_A_Moulton We're both good people. I'm sure we can both find common ground on some things. You'll be surprised how many people can get along with each other despite political differences. We just have to be open to it. And remember the extremes aren't what matter. The people matter.
@cynthia_spinney @Burghgirl69 @fr4ctals @jiveDurkey @NBCNews Incorrect. I'm not hateful or ignorant. I understand the facts very well. And as I understand it, there's still no proof of Donald J. Trump colluding with Russia. Also, that being said I do support him. But guess what? I didn't at first. I was a Bernie supporter first.
@J_A_Moulton Exactly. Now I gotta tone down my rhetoric too, because obviously being an asshole doesn't get my points across. But hey, I'm learning with you ❤️
@Burghgirl69 @cynthia_spinney @fr4ctals @jiveDurkey @NBCNews Don't say that.. That's just mean. We live in America, we may switch lanes if we need to or want to.
@J_A_Moulton Now I will follow you because I think you're a cool person who I can debate with.
@J_A_Moulton Sorry for going off on you. I was kinda being a dick. I'm just vocal about that kind of thing. We're individuals. Not the same exact person.
@J_A_Moulton Pointing out one race and not fixing our own race.. How the hell does that work? Let me tell this entire race to learn empathy.. meanwhile I'm just going to sit here and let my race kill ourselves since no one cares.
@J_A_Moulton Empathy is learned. You're correct. And you're well aware that it's not a race thing right? You understand that blacks and mexican's can be just as cruel? You don't have blinders on, do you? The world is a whole lot more gray then you would like to believe.

@J_A_Moulton I wouldn't go that far. But they did use fear as a tactic. And you would be no different. You would use the same tactic for "hopefully a different result." But in the end it would just end up being the same thing, just reskined and made pretty. "You can control us, just be nice."
@J_A_Moulton No. I'm not saying I would. Fortunately, I was raised by kind white people who taught me right from wrong. The empathy is knowing when I'm wrong and knowing that not all white people are how you would categorize them. All on the notion that some of them are bad or privileged.
@juliacraven @RaquelWillis_ Yes. Let's preach this non-sense so we can tell our kids how stupid they are. It certainly won't hurt to tell our kids that they should fear everything. Typical left-wing, silver spoon fed crazy telling us normal minorities to be offended by everything. #NoThanks

@J_A_Moulton So, you believe we should go down the road of suppressing voices for fear of being offended? You sound a whole lot like a Nazi, my friend. Controlling by fear. It's a great mentality to have. I just hope you can live with whatever consequences come about from such a stupid idea.

@gailnott @JenPercy @esquire Literally no one cares beside SJW's trying to get attention and likes.
Esquire's cover garnering all this outrage from white liberals is just another way for democrats and the media to try and remove all the shit they've been getting this past week for really really stupid things like black face. We won't forget even though you might try to.
Literally a bunch of white liberals crying about the Esquire's cover. Take your fake ass outrage and shove it. I don't need you to pretend to be outraged for my race or any other minority race for that matter. Get the hell outta here, kindly.
Literally no one wants your fake outrage, liberals. No one. Go sit down in the corner somewhere and pretend to cry so you "friends" can call you a hero somewhere else. Because honestly, you're all quite pathetic. Esquire, keep doing you and stop trying to justify yourself.
Meanwhile all the blue checked marked liberal elites who have.. what importance exactly? Who gave these idiots more powerful voice then the average american? Back the fuck down, cowards. Scared over a white male from no where. Fake outrage idiots.

@SalenaZito My reaction to this at first was "Wow, okay. I'm not sure how I feel yet." but I kept reading other peoples tweets and gained more perspective. We already know democrats won't accept this deal, they're basically saying "F---- You and your deal." Shooting themselves. 🤔

You're right. Simply saying that "I would not get in someone's face like that as a matter of personal space issues." is where I think most people are coming from. But yes, we do need to hear the rest of the story. https://t.co/pAXyCWDjJa
I think you're right. Realistically, it's one of his few moves left. After this he only has one more thing he can do. And I'm sure that can be challenged in the courts. https://t.co/Qae6xwknPB
I hope you're right, @mitchellvii. Don't you have to consider though, that a "national emergency" can be thrown out by the courts, however? Then what? https://t.co/7T9wsdyLLX
Looks like Democrats didn't care about DACA after all. Sounds about right. They turned their backs on African Americans too, why wouldn't they also do that for DACA. #ImpeachPelosi #KAG #MAGA

Not gonna lie to ya. I'm glad he's willing to negotiate unlike the Democrats. However, I do feel like this is a loss. We'll see, I guess. Kinda disappointed, y'all. Don't hate me, alright, I'm human. I think I would have rather he fought for the wall tooth and nail. https://t.co/yXQkWd6aNi

@KEEMSTAR I kind of agree, but I wouldn't be in front of the dudes face like that. I am a MAGA supporter. But still, would never be in someone's face like that. Personal Space, man. Wouldn't want someone to do it to me, either. Common sense, tbh.
True MAGA loyalists do not behave this way. This isn't what the movement is about. We vote AGAINST people like this for a reason. The left has gotten in our faces for far too long. However, that doesn't mean we should stoop to their levels. #KAG #MAGA #Trump2020 #realtalk
