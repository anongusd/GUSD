On #terrorism: The siege of Marawi in the #Philippines was symbolic of the larger struggle against the violent extremism we saw in Iraq, Syria, and Africa - and now in South and Southeast Asia.
Russian ops &amp; engagements throughout the #IndoPacific continue to rise, both to advance their own strategic interests &amp; to undermine USA's. #Russia has more bases north of the Arctic Circle than all other countries combined, &amp; is building more w/ distinctly military capabilities.
Adm. Harris’ goal: “to convince #China that its best future comes from peaceful cooperation &amp; meaningful participation in the current free &amp; open int'l order and honoring its international commitments.” After all, the Chinese economic miracle could not have happened without it.
“China’s aggression in the #SouthChinaSea moves along unabated, despite the Permanent Court of Arbitration’s tribunal ruling that invalidated China’s 9-dash line claim and unprecedented land reclamation in 2016.”
“#PACOM will continue to fully support the President’s maximum pressure campaign and be ready to respond with our allies and partners to the full range of contingency scenarios.”
“While I am encouraged by recent developments on the Korean Peninsula and the possibility of a summit between President @realDonaldTrump and #KimJongUn, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea remains our most urgent security threat in the region.”
“As the PACOM Commander I have the tremendous honor of leading approximately 375,000 Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, Airmen, Coast Guardsman, and @DeptOfDefense civilians standing watch for the largest and most diverse geographic command.”

"Our ironclad alliance is both defined by its storied past and invigorated by its boundless future." #KatchiKapshida #WeGoTogether
"In good times and bad, in moments of great hardship and great success, our two nations can always count on the close bonds and deep friendship we share as free, proud, and independent people."
"Together, we show the world what our countries can accomplish when they serve the interests of their people, respect the sovereignty of their neighbors, and uphold the rule of law."
"We know that this is no longer just a military alliance forged in blood, but one that symbolizes democracy and freedom to the world, growing stronger with each passing year."
"Today, we are vigilant together – day in and day out – against the tyranny and despair north of the 38th parallel."
"Global security challenges require multilateral solutions. Our nations all benefit from a region that preserves security, stability, and the freedom necessary for enduring prosperity -- a region where each nation gains security in concert with others."
"While diplomats make every effort to resolve this global threat through peaceful means, the armed forces of the United States and the Republic of Korea provide credible combat power to back up our diplomatic efforts. "
"The international community also stands with us in sending a clear message to the DPRK regime that the only path to survival is to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs."
"Diplomacy is the main battery, and our governments are working together to exert diplomatic and economic pressure on North Korea to work toward that goal."
"The U.S. and Republic of Korea share the same goal – to maximize pressure and sanctions on North Korea until it gives up its nuclear weapons program in a peaceful manner."
"Any attack on our two nations will be defeated. And any use of nuclear weapons by the North will be met with a massive military response that is both effective and overwhelming."
"Our commitment to this alliance – in the face of these threats – remains absolute. We’re prepared to defend ourselves and the Republic of Korea using all of the capabilities at our disposal."
"U.S. and Republic of Korea forces have responded to North Korea's aggressive actions by executing a variety of response operations to showcase the unwavering strength and resolve of our alliance."
#SECDEF Mattis expressed great concern over the technological advances on display in the 53-minute flight that went higher than any previous launch, stating that Pyongyang threatens “everywhere in the world.”
"As the world witnessed last week, #NorthKorea has made significant advancements in their ballistic missile program with the launch of its most powerful missile to date."
"Throughout its history, our alliance has shown remarkable resiliency in meeting regional challenges; however, today it faces a very serious threat."
"The #KoreanWar would be the opening struggle in the long and difficult campaign of the Cold War… a struggle that culminated in the victory of democracy over communism, of freedom over oppression, of thoroughfares and gateways over blockades and barricades."
"For over six decades, it’s been the privilege of the American armed forces to serve side-by-side with our Korean allies in this pursuit of freedom… because freedom is an idea worth fighting for – and, if need be, an idea worth dying for."
"In war and during an uneasy peace, the armed forces of our two nations have reinforced this partnership – a special bond built on mutual trust and shared values of freedom, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law."
"Throughout my long career, I’ve been privileged to serve with the fine servicemen and women of the [ROK] Armed Forces. As warriors on the front lines of freedom, you, our South Korean allies, serve with courage and honor to deliver peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula."
