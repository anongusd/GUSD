Morning world
Got me medicine from the doctor today, under the weather lately... then tomorrow going to check on my wisdom tooth at the dentist.... smh
Mr president you need to stop walking away from.a deal when you know the Democrats can make something right to have border security, and a wall to protect the United states, and not having refugees coming and killing our people. @realDonaldTrump
All the Democrats need to have wake up call. And stop being on vacation,  and start doing what is right for the American people. @chuckschumer @SpeakerPelosi
@realDonaldTrump @SebGorka Your disgrace stop being a big baby!
Choosing the Patriots to beat the chiefs, and choosing the rams beat the saints!!!

@realDonaldTrump It's not your way or if it is the high way
Shutting down the government does not solve problems or settle to make deals with Democrats,  just only makes it worse @realDonaldTrump
President says that the economic  is stable but he only does the good for his own deed not for the people! @realDonaldTrump

@realDonaldTrump only if his prediction was true of what the past happen, only who thinks like that is a god,  he is just man that needs to be removed from the oval office.
@realDonaldTrump government shut down does not solve a thing to settle deals with Democrats. Like I said ignorance a president that we have! Blames media but should blame his bad work ethics.
@realDonaldTrump president claims his way or the high way that's not how you make deals and ignorant of listening with others
If you can read this, you’ve helped me reach 10 followers. Thank you!
Of course the law enforcement is corrupted its because the politicians only care for themselves! @realDonaldTrump
Who cares of the pass on what Hillary or Obama did anymore worry about the future of our economy and about the American people mr president @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump @JesseBWatters You only worry about it greed and getting popular
It turns out that trump can talk all this shit on Twitter and only worried about his greed and getting popular @realDonaldTrump
Media well love to get info from the president so they will think he is doing bad job.
President says he blames the Democrats for 2 deaths at the border when it's the border patrol and security too blame Not the Democrats or Republicans at fault it's you threatening shutting down the government for not going your way on making deals @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer
All politicians lie dont believe a damn thing what the government is saying to you. That's wat so great about this country, you can either believe or disbelieve. Personally I disbelieve in all what the government does or tries to do.
President says hes doing good for the country, but he is not doing it for the American people, he is only in office for himself to look good. Dont believe politicians. Or the media! All fake.
Having good Christmas. Had good time with family this wknd, and friends. Be safe eveyone.
@realDonaldTrump Trump ur lame ass and a boring ass president
