@EmilyTsuda Love it! A lot of companies are now using social media to hire both employees and interns.
RT @DarrinSNHU: A6) Search for virtual opportunities! These are becoming more prevalent in many industries!  #snhucareerchat
A6:  Virtual internships are also a great option.  #snhucareerchat
A6: Call up a local business and ask if you can be their first intern. #snhucareerchat
A5: Also, don't forget to search #internships on social media. 	 #snhucareerchat
A5: Visit your career center. It is a great resource. #snhucareerchat
A5: https://t.co/uFBbkljYW8, https://t.co/2cyL4Y04SQ, Wayup,  your career center and Indeed.   #snhucareerchat
A4: Focus on being helpful and the different ways that you can add value to the people around you.  #snhucareerchat
A4: Internships help you get from where you are to where you want to be. BOOM! #snhucareerchat
@KAKraft I think you can do both.
A3: Feel free to tweet me your dream job and I’ll be happy to help as best as I can.  #snhucareerchat
A3: Use your resources on campus. #snhucareerchat
A3) Going to the career center is the #1 stop on the internship train.  #snhucareerchat
@sya1989 I can help :) Email me: Ambassador@internqueen.com
@ZeporiaW Yes! Remember rejection doesn't mean NEVER it just means not right now :) Welcome :)
@Doriiumm Also, give yourself a goal of how many people you want to connect with. I know networking events can be intimidating.
@Doriiumm In terms of asking questions after the panel I would see how you can relate to the panelist and how you think their experience can help you.
@Doriiumm Hi Doriam! Thanks for joining me. I filmed a video a while back with networking tips. Watch it here: https://t.co/PjeLGAkXmG
A2) Make you planner your best friend. Design your schedule, write it out and then bring it to life.  #snhucareerchat
A2) Keep in mind the majority of these internships are paid. #snhucareerchat
A2: Some internships require between 12 and 20 hours per week and other require a full time commitment.  #snhucareerchat

@KAKraft Freelancing is also a great option.
@KAKraft I would definitely look into paid internships in the area.  A lot of companies now offer those which are perfect if you still want to have income coming in.
@KAKraft Hi- Yes, I would definitely recommend pursuing an internship. Are you already working in the creative writing industry?

@SNHUCareer A4:  Here are some ways to show them you're a great intern! https://t.co/XBtsr7JEm9 #snhucareerchat
@SNHUCareer A4: Always go above and beyond. This will help you make an impact at your #internship #snhucareerchat
@SNHUCareer A4: It's a resume builder and it will help you figure out what you want and don't want to do.  #snhucareerchat
@SNHUCareer A3: After you apply follow up with us. We are here to help. #snhucareerchat
@SNHUCareer A3: Identify the opportunities. On https://t.co/uFBbkljYW8 we still have several opportunities available #snhucareerchat
@SNHUCareer A3: The first thing to note is that it is not too late  #snhucareerchat
A2: We're asking you to use two of those to intern (promise you'll learn a lot and have a lot of fun too) #snhucareerchat
A2: Most students are in school for at least 8 semesters (11 semesters if you include summer) #snhucareerchat
A2: I find that once my schedule makes sense on paper I can work on bringing it to life.  #snhucareerchat
A2: Decide what tool you are going to use to manage your time. For me it's google calendar.  #snhucareerchat
@SNHUCareer A2: Most internships are only going to require 12-15 hours per week. Some will be FT but those will be paid #snhucareerchat
