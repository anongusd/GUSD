Wrote about this when Trump was elected. Obama era logically led to the Trump era. Trump era logically leads to an era where @AOC leads the counter movement. Prediction: if Trump wins in 2020, she will be his successor in 2024..   https://t.co/HbfsFnSQSF ‚Ä¶
We haven't seen a progressive star on the rise like @AOC since Obama. She is taking the new innovation in politics (DTV) and applying it the same way as Trump. She already has more Twitter followers than anyone in Congress. She will be 36 in 2024.
Rise of @AOC reveals that this is how the American politics works. As a pendulum. Trump was the "anti-Obama". @AOC is the "anti-Trump" - and America's logical reaction as an avatar. She is going direct to voter, just like Trump did - but w/ opposite policies &amp; identity politics.

@BlakleyConnor @matthewjdowd @abcnews @RashidaTlaib Also from the article: "McCarthy shrugged off questions about Trump's own long history of incendiary language, saying 'That action should not stand.'" @kevinomccarthy . It strikes me as interesting that he calls her out, but on Trump's language shrugs it off?

I can't think of a single opinion piece I've seen on POTUS demanding he apologize for daily &amp; countless infringements on public decency. I'm sure they're out there. Something just struck me as off about this.
@CarlEppolito I guess I don‚Äôt see it as an eye for an eye. Sexual assault bragging versus a swear word.
@BlakleyConnor @matthewjdowd @abcnews @RashidaTlaib That‚Äôs true. That said, there is moral relativism to consider here. Askinh Rashida, a woman of  color, to apologize for one f-word grates on me.

Dear @matthewjdowd and @abcnews - I disagree with you vociferously. Asking @RashidaTlaib to apologize for using profanity is to hold her account for something men do all the time. The individual who she is referring to bragged about sexual assault. Cussing might be merited? https://t.co/zAR4K0Cwwq

The bad news is that's a lot to take on. The good news is with that sense of agency there is nothing you can't fix! ‚ú®
When it comes to your team's professional problems you will come to realize: it's all your fault. Every problem is the ceo's fault.
What I learned from my mom is that a leader also takes on the personal problems (those they are invited into). So you know the whole person.
Then one day it dawns on you if you are a half decent ceo that other people's problems are your problems. At least the professional ones.
I love being ceo. You spend all day worrying about other people's problems so that you can forget your own.

@jacksongates @brianspaly me too
@jacksongates EXACTLY
A great founder can evolve a mediocre product into a great product, but a great company will never evolve from a founder who can't evolve.
It's your job as the investor to bet on which founders will be great at evolving their product. You can't outsource that. It's in your gut.
A big mistake investors make is assuming the product at launch should be as good as the product at scale. It never is. It can't possibly be.

@ChipConley are you still involved in Joie de vivre?
@blastchatbleez @BryanWolff01 BW didn't you show me some amazing economist article on Messi as outlier even from CR7?
@blastchatbleez @BryanWolff01 someone needs to analyze soccer player VORP though to help with this
@blastchatbleez @BryanWolff01 I agree on Mj and CR7 sort of except you forget Mj assists, boards, defense &gt;&gt; more like LM
@blastchatbleez @BryanWolff01 because ultimately CR7 is for himself. Like MJ pre 1988. I think LM goes down as greatest ever?
@blastchatbleez @BryanWolff01 I think LM needs World Cup to bolster. At least ARG competes. Portugal? Awful
@blastchatbleez @BryanWolff01 I see Xavi like magic or Nash. But LM closer to MJ. Cr7 like Kobe. MJ and LM game both so complete.
@blastchatbleez I might be wrong but Messi has the full game like Jordan did ; and the championships to prove it - if ARG had only won...
@blastchatbleez I feel like CR7 is more like the best wide receiver of all time - Who? - doesn't make his teammates better

@FrankDenbow weekend getWays has been done. This is a new idea. I may be wrong
@FrankDenbow plenty of margin. Think about the big booking companies. Huge companies
@FrankDenbow  exactly! And the whole world gets "closer". In fact closer is probably a better name for it
@tylertringas sounds like a cool two sided marketplace to me? I may be wrong. Think of it like @ebay for flights in real time
@tylertringas yes. That is the issue. But if someone built a SAAs company that made THEM more money too
@FrankDenbow it is what peter thiel night call a secret
@FrankDenbow sure. But why does it have to be that way? It doesn't. It's a hidden market opportunity
@FrankDenbow so you can fly anytime and not worry about booking for the airport
@FrankDenbow should be weekdays too
@fazz it was in manhattan.
@fazz @susantran @lyft yes. The first ride I took was with a woman. She was so nice.

RT @jjsimonCNN: @dunn You can finally afford a car?

I am so proud of you @GIRLBOSS

@tangentstyle YES! Here we agree
@tangentstyle maybe global utility was the wrong word. I did say utility not monopoly, right? :-)
@tangentstyle totally agree. No trust bust. How many users do you think twitter will have in 2050, and what % of world pop?
@tangentstyle so why can't it be global utility? Presence of regional monopolies doesn't preclude poss of global monopoly
@BryceWeiner ha. I would say it is good or evil as a car
@tangentstyle say more
Twitter will be a global utility one day like the telephone.

@dillchen @lyft @HotelTonight @1WayFlight just flights.
Startup idea: @lyft or @hoteltonight for flights. It would (necessarily) only be one-way flights. @1WayFlight you already figured it out!

@jasonillian @500Startups @Bonobos it is of course highly admirable! It is entirely their choice (like abortion)
A country built on the idea of freedom should pursue initiatives which make the world more free.
@500Startups @Bonobos what I meant  to say is companies *and* countries ! Companies it seems we believe can happen faster
