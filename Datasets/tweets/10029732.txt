@Hyken Thank you!  Hour felt like 10 min! #cxo
@IBMVivisimo Many thanks to you for hosting!!!  This has been amazing and very very INTENSE!  ;-) #cxo
MANY THANKS EVERYONE!!!  What an amazing hour! #cxo
@IBMVivisimo Yes, and leverage the right data sources - including external data! #cxo
@AccentureSocial Nice! #cxo
@AccentureSocial Tiny data! #cxo
RT @StacyLeidwinger: A8: Identify the biz driver 1st &amp; build solution around that - dont start building technology 4 technology sake #cxo
A8: We have biz owners, biz analysts, data scientists, and data management working (seamlessly) together. #cxo
A8: Big Data and Data Science are a team sport.  #cxo
a8: Team asking the questions matter.  and making sure methodologies are as unbiased as possible. #cxo
A8: Again, big data and big science is very nascent.  so very much a case by case basis. #cxo
@RutterNet Agreed!  Can't beat a human touch. #cxo
@jeanniecw Customer Experience/Insight team can reside with the product or marketing.  It's the synergy between that's necessary. #cxo
@AccentureSocial Depends on what we mean by "own".   #cxo
@tmustacchio A7: Business owners - who actually owns and is accountable for.   Certainly many teams need to collab, but necesssary. #cxo
@Hyken exactly! #cxo
@IBMVivisimo Ownership of big data should resides with biz owners, who have great understanding for the biz. Not the other way around. #cxo
@IBMVivisimo Privacy and security go hand in hand.  No eggs broken. #cxo
@stevemassi RT!  Great point. #cxo
NLP = natural language processing.  This can help better understand unstructured data - email, blogs, tweets, social media, etc. #cxo
A6:  We're investing in better understanding unstructured data.  NLP is one research field that can be well leveraged. #cxo
@TPDashboard There are many more affordable systems as well.  E.g Hadoop. #cxo
@VOCMountaineer Yes, definitely.   #cxo
@stevemassi But we don't know what we don't know (and we're not as smart.. ;-)  test-learn, lean, agile methods do well.  #cxo
@IBMVivisimo A6: Competitive advantages, at a high level, include being scalable, real time, and having predictive powers #cxo
@stevemassi Depends on what you need to solve, unfortunately.  Def simplify first.  we started with trxn data first and added more. #cxo
@jeanniecw Yes, cultural change certainly was one of the challenges at PayPal.  But we embraced it! #cxo
A5: Many great tools out there now to help analysts better sift through data.  Many still missing too. That's where data science is use #cxo
@VOCMountaineer That's right.  But from commitment, then comes looking into potential solutions.  #cxo
In "big data," we address both the infrastructure challenges as well as how-to-solve challenges.   But diff teams. #cxo
A5: One of the biggest steps is the understanding that customer experience data is gold. #cxo
A5: Common challenges include not doing anything about it. #cxo
RT @GregOrtbach: Agree with ability to scale 100% but dont get hung up waiting on process when listening can start now. @jeanniecw  #cxo
@IBMVivisimo You didn't tell me this was this intense!  I now need a weekend.  ;-) #cxo
@StacyLeidwinger Great call.  Yes, making sure their past experiences are stored and accessible for human touch is personalization!  #cxo
@stevemassi Absolutely.  Better understanding the "data gap", better solutions to understanding of the customer can be found. #cxo
In big data, we not only look for internal data but also any external data from partners as well. #cxo
A4: Also, both behavioral+transactional data can help better understand the customer's next intensions. #cxo
A4: Things like collaborative filtering - e.g. who bought this, also bought that.  Need big data to better increase/improve predictions #cxo
@IBMVivisimo A4: In many many awesome ways! #cxo
A3: There is no one answer...  Need to keep on looking! #cxo
@GregOrtbach Absolutely.  In our case, we try to listen to 113MM active users.  We need a way to listen scalably. #cxo
@IBMVivisimo That's right.  That's what i call "data gap."  What data don't we have?  Hypothesize then test and learn. #cxo
Before, "instrumentation" was an after thought.  Now/future, we gather data for more precise understanding of customers. #cxo
@IBMVivisimo That is correct - for now.  Way we design products now should be more to better understand the customer! #cxo
A3: We look for strong signals for a use case.  But there are thousands of use cases!  So, there is no "one size fits all" #cxo
@GregOrtbach In general, cultivating "intelligent interactions" is more an art than science right now. #cxo
@jeanniecw With that said, much of the data science methodologies may be similar. #cxo
@jeanniecw Yes.  Very different types of data.  Value and use cases we provide for each are very different. #cxo
This is really intense!!  ;-) #cxo
But behavioral data has never been stronger than transactional.  "Intention guessing" vs."what i spent money on" #cxo
@Marcio_Saito Can you expound? #cxo
For example, if we are predicting some lifecycle - customer engagement - behavioral data does have good predictive powers. #cxo
A2: It really depends on the use case. #cxo
Q2: Very carefully...  ;-) #cxo
@IBMVivisimo Difficult to have access to that type of data that isn't ours.  (if i understand your question correctly..) #cxo
@StacyLeidwinger In our context, there are merchants and consumers as customers.  Def use cases and value we provide are diff. #cxo
@Marcio_Saito Yes, predictive at an individual level.   #cxo
Certainly other types of data - e.g. feedback, behavioral, etc. - have commerce signals as well.  Need to leverage all! #cxo
Transactional data is the strongest signal in commerce use cases. #cxo
Another example is to determine if customers will, for example, churn or decline in usage. #cxo
For example, just with transactional data, we can predict what people will have high propensity to buy looking at historical trxns. #cxo
We can predict and score much of what the customer will/won't do with high probability. #cxo
Turns out that transactional data has a lot of predictive powers.  #cxo
Transactional data closes the loop, and "puts the money where the mouth is," so to speak. #cxo
@IBMVivisimo Definitely transactional data (to begin with). #cxo
i'm ready.  Pls ask away! #cxo
Hello!  Really excited to be here. #cxo
