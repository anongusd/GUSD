Socialism is Marxism is Communism is Tyranny. Hence the 2nd Amendment which protects us from a tyrannical gov't which is also why Socialists/Globalists want to confiscate our guns.
A "path to citizenship" already exists and is called "legally immigrating".
Coming to America and assimilating does not mean turning us into the country you left.
It should be who is the best for the position not what the color of their skin is.
Per current TV and movies, whites only marry minorities and blacks make up 30 to 50% of America.
