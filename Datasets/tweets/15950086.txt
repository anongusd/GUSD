@HilaryHoynes True true true. Was more making the point that those approximate a child allowance through in-kind benefits.
Given that nothing will happen for the next two years at least nationally, I'm pretty disappointed at how modest Dem triumvirate agendas are.
But I don't see why a subsidized public option open to employers is impossible in New York or New Jersey, or why a child allowance is impossible, or fully debt-free college, or a mini-Green New Deal, or free child care, etc. etc. etc.
There are some places where I have sympathy for the arg. California and Washington have weird tax increase limitations. Full single-payer is hard without a Medicare waiver.
In fact it probably makes more sense for local service provision like universal child care centers, universal pre-K, debt-free public college, etc. to be done by states rather than Congress, though Congress can subsidize.
"They don't control their currency?" Neither do Eurozone members and it hasn't stopped Finland from offering a big welfare state. Balanced budget requirements? Well yeah, raise taxes. "Tax flight"? Not huge, as @cristobalyoung5 has found based on past state millionaire taxes.
There are a million excuses liberals like to offer as to why X, Y, or Z huge policy idea can't be tried by Dem triumvirate states like California or New York, and most of them aren't very good.

@hill_charlotte @robreich My question is about how to apply that ideal theory standard in practice. I don't think the Warren/AOC/Sanders tax plans threaten good giving, but if 1-2 billionaires are vastly more willing to fund effective global health than Congress (cf Reich's discovery arg), what do we do?
@hill_charlotte Definitely, I agree with basically all of this, and would note that Gates has intervened in politics (particularly on US ed) in a troubling, plutocratic way. I talked about this with @robreich a bit: https://t.co/gCPhOBcLkO

@econwonk also worth asking (and I don't know the labor econ literature well enough to say) whether monopsony occurs at the city or metro-wide level. Presumably Amazon would still compete for workers with NYC tech firms, hedge funds in LI/CT, etc.
@econwonk Oh I don’t think it would be entirely good by any means but there would be some Moretti-style benefits for non-Amazon employees
I joke but it really would be huge in a place like Newark. The downtown has ~60,000 jobs; if Amazon adds 50,000 and maybe another 50,000 in associated service jobs, and it’s basically a company town overnight https://t.co/cSW0Q8D9YS

Ok, that's it from me. Thanks so so so much to @christinamta for all the beautiful graphs, and @CpspPoverty for doing all the hard work of estimating effects on poverty.
That gets close to @arindube's EBITC: you subsidize wages but also provide a real floor for folks who can't find work. https://t.co/ghBWI0PVAu
My ideal would combine a small ($2,000-3,000) cash benefit for childless adults, a large ($4,000-5,000) per-child benefit, and a per-earner credit that replaces EITC and the standard deduction (worth, say, 30 percent of your earnings up to the poverty line), all paid out biweekly
The result is kind of a hodge-podge, but ideally you'd want a more artful combination, like what @ElaineMaag and Jim Nunns attempt here, that separates child benefits from work benefits in a clean, clear way: https://t.co/kzvzmweLw0
One last thing: think about how all these bills combine together. Warren, Klobuchar, Gillibrand, Booker, and Harris all support the Bennet-Brown child allowance. Merkley and Gillibrand support the Rent Relief Act.
LIFT/GAIN are tied to work. Bennet-Brown (which I *LOVE*, don't get me wrong) is tied to kids. But HOME and Rent Relief offer a basic benefit even to childless adults who can't find work, or are disabled but denied SSDI/SSI, or are elderly and are poor despite Social Security.
All that said, the rent bills do something important: they establish a cash benefit for EVERYONE that's not tied to work or having kids.
That's a good way to push more people to live in high-cost cities, but we should ask if that's a policy goal we want to achieve when those cities show no indication that they want to build houses for people to live in.
Finally, there's a horizontal equity question. The HOME Act and Rent Relief Act both give WAY MORE to poor people living in high-cost cities like New York and SF than to people living in, say, Houston or Arizona.
But … that's a bad policy design! It should pay out monthly to make life easier for beneficiaries.
The other arg that rents wouldn't rise is that Harris and Booker both give the rent subsidy in an annual lump sum, not monthly allowances that could easily translate into rent checks. So the money wouldn't be spent on rent, and landlords couldn't capture it.
That might be right, but I suspect labeling it as "money for rent" matters in terms of how folks spend it — and how landlords respond.
The arg that the subsidies wouldn't jack up rent is basically that rent boosts aren't different from *any* substantial cash payment to poor people, as rent is such a huge part of most poor households' budgets.
Basically: would landlords see the big rent bill pass and jack up rents in response to capture much or all of the subsidy? In cities where it's hard to build more, they couldn't try to benefit by actually constructing new units. So instead they might just try to bilk tenants.
That said, there are reasons for skepticism, as @JoshTMcCabe explains in this thread. The metric we're using weights housing costs heavily, which makes rent bills look good. And we need to consider the dynamic effects subsidies would have on rent overall. https://t.co/XukEwmbCin
By far the biggest takeaway for me was that I have been sleeping on the rental subsidy bills from @KamalaHarris and @CoryBooker. Both appear to be quite well targeted at poor people, and deserve to be in the mix with bills explicitly framed around poverty like Bennet-Brown.

I genuinely don't think there's a great policy reason to prefer full M4A to employer buy-in + auto-enroll for uninsured, and a lot of political reasons to prefer the latter, but one of the political reasons is the CBO, and if they don't play ball, it's a problem.
I'd be curious what @PaulNVandeWater, who worked on that CBO report, thinks would happen with a generous employer-accessible public option, esp. if accompanied with a revived individual mandate. https://t.co/zBEWrI5bVx
