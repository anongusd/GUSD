Once again all the unAmerican groups rear their ugly head, like the Hispanic caucus who would rather see no borders and the Mexican flag flying over Washington.
@HispanicCaucus @realDonaldTrump you call providing a secure border and knowing who comes and goes in our country harmful?  I guess you've forgotten about innocent citizens who were victims of low lifes that have invaded our country.

@SenGillibrand It is unconscionable that your so concern with the welfare of those who break our laws and ignore our borders.   You may want to read the oath you swore to.  And if you have time, apologize to the families here that lost loved ones due to illegals. https://t.co/KQPjoUqgTu
