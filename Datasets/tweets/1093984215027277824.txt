Climbing turns can cause spin stalls. Steady climbs. Avoid spins. Avoid stalls.

@Cmdr_Hadfield Thought you might like this. It's an old on but it's a good one. https://t.co/vJ9QjofN8H Basic is always a good starting place.
@Cmdr_Hadfield I'm in fair condition but I'm still working on learning to fly and the advanced technical degree. Good work on making the Master Class for future Astros, Taikos and Cosmos.
Every couple of day I have a few moments of frustration that seem to be unavoidable. I started taking medication. It helps.

@GrantCardone I'll never have enough money to save them all. How do you help people without just giving them moeny that won't help them in the first place?
Motivation doesn't mean anything if everyone says no to your ideas. Change your questions so that you want people to say no to them. You might be surprised.
Sadly money alone isn't enough to improve the life of future generations.
@WarrenBuffett @BernieSanders Both agree that the ultra rich could spare a little bit of change to the peasents. A healthy economy is a wealthy economy.

I keep forgetting that half of twitter is automated garbage. https://t.co/ZPIhIHpD8A Let's talk about is here on my twitch stream.
Almost everyone sounds stupid on the internet. It's all just a bunch of talking down to others while claiming to be something special. https://t.co/ZPIhIHpD8A
@Lean4Lifetime Intelligence without money is just a stupid homeless person. These kinds of quotes are are stupid but you have money so you must be smart. Right?

@royalmusing @vowales @royalwatch3 @TeaCambridges @victoriaarbiter @Ginalichi1 @9HoneyAU @THERoyalCrabbit @CepeSmith @RoyalCentral That makes sense.
@royalwatch3 @royalmusing @vowales @TeaCambridges @victoriaarbiter @Ginalichi1 @9HoneyAU @THERoyalCrabbit @CepeSmith @RoyalCentral I'm not sure either. It's ok though. We all add a little bit to each other's knowledge. I'm not exactly sure what I was referencing either. Have a wonderful day.
@royalmusing @vowales @royalwatch3 @TeaCambridges @victoriaarbiter @Ginalichi1 @9HoneyAU @THERoyalCrabbit @CepeSmith @RoyalCentral Thanks for the correction Marlene. I wasn't sure.
Etherium is useful as toekns for sharing value. Instead of likes and shares it adds valuation to content and creators.
Good news about Bitcoin. IT might become worthless. Other good news. Etherium has an actual functional use. Emercoin might be similar also but don't invest more than what you can afford to lose.
@vowales @royalwatch3 @TeaCambridges @victoriaarbiter @Ginalichi1 @9HoneyAU @THERoyalCrabbit @royalmusing @CepeSmith @RoyalCentral I think that the official title of consorts of the crown would be titled Duke or Dutchess. I could be wrong however. It's a great question.

I realize that I've been streaming for 24 hours.  I feel tired and I think one of my neighbors has demons inside of them. They keep making strange noises and banging something.
Reddit is helpful is some ways that Twitter isn't but I would never want one to be the other.

@paszaBiceps ?
@elonmusk Good morning Elon. How are you today. I'm getting better at the violin so that's kind of nice. 	I'm still working towards a grand unified field theory but it's slow going.
Happy not Valentine's Day. I'm not saying Valentine's day is bad. I'm saying that not everyone has a good one. You're not alone. To those in relationships. Enjoy the time you have. Take care everyone.
