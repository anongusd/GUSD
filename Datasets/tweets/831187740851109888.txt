@RidgeKnapp @RobSandIA IMO the best reason to hold the office is to increase our bench of candidates to run in more important races like the senate. Maybe it makes sense for Sand to hold off if Grassley is gonna retire in 22, but if we win the WH next year we won’t have a chance at winning in a midterm
@RidgeKnapp I’m a fan of @RobSandIA to run against Ernst but Scholten is good too

@jackcurran49 This seems cool until you realize it's because we had a period where Rs had won 5 of the last 6 presidential elections
HW was the last of the good ones. I vehemently disagree with almost everything he pushed on a policy level, but I have no doubt that he was a good man with a good heart, and our country is worse off without him. May he rest in peace.

@PaulKimCT @SenhorRaposa The Republican Revolution knocked out moderate/conservative Dems from the south and rural areas; I think Kennedy being the face of liberalism after 94 has more to do with the fact that the party was just not very liberal then. Kennedy was fairly lonely on the left even before 94.

@DanRosenheck @RalstonReports @Redistrict @SeanTrende @PatrickRuffini @kkondik I think the argument is that the Reid machine will consistently produce small but solid margins for Ds, making Nevada close in terms of vote share but so inelastic that Rs will never break through. Similar to how in MS Ds can easily break 40% but never win. Not sure I agree tho.

Of course, it seems obvious now that Trump didn’t drain the swamp, and in fact only made it swampier, but back in ‘16, if you were an undecided voter, drain the swamp was probably pretty appealing and persuasive. Luckily, Trump can’t reuse it in 2020.
“Drain the swamp” as an idea plays well across the political spectrum, and it fits well with Trump’s “outsider” persona. Plus, there’s no real way for Clinton to prove that Trump wouldn’t drain the swamp, because he’d never been in gov’t.
I think people really underestimate the extent to which “drain the swamp” affected the 2016 election. Trump first used the slogan (that I can remember) less than a month before e-day, and it was a compelling message that isn’t easily countered by dems.

@jonfavs Jon, I thought we learned our lesson about premature celebration in 2016. There are still over 13 hours for a nuclear war!
@asgvisalaw @julissaarce I think that would give him more cover to vote with Republicans. Right now Schumer and the rest of the Dems have some leverage over him, but if he were an independent then Dems would sacrifice any sway they have.
@asgvisalaw @julissaarce I think it's also worth noting that no one voted against the DREAM Act tonight, they voted against shutting down the gov't over the DREAM Act. Many of these Ds would probably vote for a DREAM Act, even if they didn't vote how we'd ideally prefer tonight.
@asgvisalaw @julissaarce He does cross the aisle to vote with Dems, we just don't hear about it because Dems voting with Dems isn't news. I wish we could put a Sherrod Brown or Kamala Harris in that seat, but in WV the choice isn't between Manchin and a Harris, it's between Manchin and a Mike Lee-type.
@asgvisalaw @julissaarce Obamacare only exists today because we had Joe Manchin back in June/July. I don't agree with his politics on a lot of issues, including this vote, but we should recognize the value of holding seats like his all the same.
@julissaarce In West Virginia? I disagree with the way these Senators voted, but there's no scenario in which we elect a super progressive candidate from WV. The VA and DE delegations have no excuse, but with Manchin, we should be glad we ever have his vote on anything in the first place
@julissaarce Is it productive to brand some of the D's most vulnerable next year as the "deportation caucus?" Surely there's room for sensible criticism without risking a situation where progressives cut off their noses to spite their faces.
