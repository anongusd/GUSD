@KydarnDeborah @GOP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @BarackObama Yes, Putin. The one who is attacking us. 		Trump's not "mean". Trump is a draft dodging, wife cheating, women abusing, shell of a man. He's a morally bankrupt piece of human garbage

@AskedEtAnswered @BradMossEsq At best this is basic indifference to tact and professionalism by the highest in office.. At worst it's the work of a vindictive narcissist motivated by politics. 	Trump is single handedly destroying the GOP and emboldening Dems in a way no Dem could have ever done
@WhiskeyMD247365 @FoxNews The adults in the room are gone. He's imploding. His supporters wouldn't dare question a person who holds any power so they won't see it. Everyone else can't believe what they're witnessing lol
@AskedEtAnswered @BradMossEsq Yes, Sessions referenced it. In what you linked the allegation was "unauthorized disclosure to the news media". Well that is vague. The FBI DD chooses what he'd like to disclose to the media. What is the specified reason for his firing?
@AskedEtAnswered The OIG report on allegations of misconduct by MCCabe is what I'm referring to.
@WhiskeyMD247365 @FoxNews It's already backfiring.	Trump is scared shtless by Mueller.	POTUS can't even look people in the eye when he fires them. Corrupt coward.

@AsongweMaga @akm__76m @NRO Polish army to fight Russia, when he could literally just abide by the law and implement existing sanctions and crush them from the inside out? That makes sense to you Asongwe?

@akm__76m @AsongweMaga @NRO Again simplified but they were clobbered and we had other threats to focus on. Once word they started to get up and start their mafia state bs again. Obama snatched oligarch properties, expelled ~30+ Russian reps and had to avoid optics of trying to effct DJT electn. Wiki it
@BreakoffBetty @littleboblu @PeterAlexander @NBCNews Seems peculiar is all, considering Trump was and is a well known morally bankrupt womanizing dbag
@akm__76m @AsongweMaga @NRO Relationship is complex but as simplified as possible HRC called Putin's election a fraud (96% voted for him LOL), in went sanctions again. Ruble crumbles, Putin blames HRC for economic collapse.
@BreakoffBetty @littleboblu @PeterAlexander @NBCNews Seems relevant to discussion and that response adds to believability that "Women for Trump" is a thing ü§¢
@akm__76m @AsongweMaga @NRO Do you know the timeline of Russia's PREVIOUS sanctions? The ones that caused their economy to collapse. It was in defense of democracy IN RUSSIA. So every American should question why Trump ignored deadlines to slap Russia for F'ing with OUR elections. Or even one word from DJT
@akm__76m @AsongweMaga @NRO He also signed the sanctions bill. Then deadline day came and Putin made it clear to his people Trump was his btch.		 SANCTIONS DAY-He arrested political opponent violently (previous elections called bs incited last sanctns), did a fly by 5 ft. from a Navy plane

@AsongweMaga @NRO Your point? Rogers has a strategy on Russia as well, it's his job, called defense. So the argument is because Trump didn't appoint him he shouldn't be given a strategy to counter?
@AsongweMaga @NRO Slow down, one thing at a time. First, you'll see what I meant regarding *despite of, if you read the article I linked.	Russia attacked a US outfit on the ground, NSA says no orders to counter ongoing cyber war, can you provide one statement from Trump on the ongoing attacks?
@AsongweMaga @NRO Pentagon decision despite Trump* would be more accurate IMO		Russian merc group Wagner attacked a US outfit in Syria last week and Trump did nothing. By nothing I mean, tweeted more attacks on the DOJ regarding a FISA issued on a Russian spy.
@AsongweMaga @NRO https://t.co/G8Ob53gYdE
@AsongweMaga @NRO No this is likely why H.R. is being rumored at being pushed out. 		He could easily send Russia in to an economic collapse (remember previous sanctions?). Trump fought against the verbiage of this agreement last year to allow arming them. I'd have to look for the article

@TruthisnotT @TheJuanWilliams Yes, of course it didn't and no one is saying any different LOL. Remember the first post. It's a standard RICO case build. Have to show the crime FIRST. That's what these indictments are about. Try to follow along
@TruthisnotT @TheJuanWilliams So the answer is you don't know what he lied about this week.
@TruthisnotT @TheJuanWilliams If you ever have a thought of your own and can rationalize any of the questions about Flynn, Page, sanctions or anything Russia related, please let me know. Until then have fun with your head up your ass.

@TruthisnotT @TheJuanWilliams Why did Trump hire Page?? He had ZERO experience. Why did Trump hire Flynn after BEING TOLD HE WAS COMPROMISED?? Why did Trump lie OVER and OVER and OVER about Russian meetings? Why do we know about discussions he has had with Putin AFTER RUSSIAN MEDIA REPORTS IT.
@TruthisnotT @TheJuanWilliams YES and we had repercussions in place ffs. So why no sanctions? Why is Trump only concerned about himself today and not the gd dm USA
@TruthisnotT @TheJuanWilliams The verbage was clear. NOT IMPLICATED IN THIS INDICTMENT. Has nothing to do with upcoming indictments, c'mon man.

@RabieAlsaeed @BarinNelyse @BMW Yea, sounds right Rabie. They started this "ghost" emblem nonsense that is popular in the EU which is essentially a fancy way of saying no numerical badges on trunk lid. Makes figuring out wth you just bought even more fun
@BarinNelyse @BMW All good, BMW makes too many variants to keep up with than top that with different country specs and it's near impossible to keep up with
@BarinNelyse @BMW G12 must be the face lift 2019 model	G11 is 2018-2016 but the "L" model was never available in Vegas as far as I know. This is post is by BMW not BMWUSA as a side note.
@thehill Classic RICO case build structure		Article missed the mark
@BarinNelyse @BMW *Same line comment was in reference to the wheel base	F02 still seemed to be much more spacious in the rear due to general cabin design.	G11 is to drive, F02 felt more suited to be driven in. At least with a bit more modesty than a ‚Äúhand made‚Äù aka overpriced vehicle anyway

@KBabbs_Miller If Hillary did then investigate! 		That's how your rationalizing not implementing sanctions? They're F'ing LAW
@KBabbs_Miller Russia is a big place, I'm sure there are plenty of stories.This discussion was about Trump being a Putin stooge and not defending our dmn voting process and what ties he has with those that attacked our voting process. Republicans just dont give a F
@KBabbs_Miller What in gods name does Hillary have to do with this discussion and why would I care about Hillary? Fox makes people think anyone is thinking about her other than them.
@KBabbs_Miller No one can show anything! We need to see the entire FISA to make ANY conclusions. We've seen 3.5 pages of GARBAGE of a 50 FIFTY age FISA RENEWAL. That's enough to throw out crap like "corrupt FBI" ??
@KBabbs_Miller "Didn't vindicate Trump". TRUMP SAID THAT WAS ITS PURPOSE. He's such a dmn fool, how the F do smart people like you fall for this sht?
@KBabbs_Miller Right, Gowdy's compassion for...Kremlin puppet Page...was the memo's concern. Bullsht memo as if the spying WASNT JUSTIFIED. It absolutely was. Ridiculous
@KBabbs_Miller Trump tucks his tail and cowers. He's a disgrace to the flag		https://t.co/MfcYMjcCFi
@KBabbs_Miller Means nothing equates to debunked in my reference. Russia hysteria? Yea, I'd say I'm not a big fan of an adversary to the US launching a cyber attack, us placing sanctions for that attempt, Trump being afraid to implement (wtf?), while they are confirmed as prepping mdtrm attack.
@KBabbs_Miller That was debunked approx. 30 seconds after its release, by a republican
@KBabbs_Miller I appreciate a good debate regardless and appreciate being able to have a discussion without nonsense pictures and insults. We'll both be watching closely and you have yourself a nice rest of the evening. :)
@KBabbs_Miller Now all of the intel majority clowns are under investigation. Did Fox mention that?
@KBabbs_Miller Nunes could have read it Babbs, he chose Gowdy. Who then debunked its purpose, then decided to retire from a POWERFUL position. Coincidence? Possibly, but the entire thing was done wrong and had a single motive.
@KBabbs_Miller Trey Gowdy then came out and neutered the memo. Nunes's staff members, including Patel also read it. Nunes was part of the transition team and his website was exposed as using a phishing virus to pull info, whch was being sent to a Russia based ips! Yea, here's ALL docs, no way
@KBabbs_Miller And if it wasn't, why not take the course of action in place to make sure? Like the IG or speaking to the FISA judge, or actually reading the FISA docs? It was a clear as day effort to undermine the investigation. A criminal investigation in to a politician.
@KBabbs_Miller We have no evidence the FISA RENEWAL (3rd, 4th?) signed by multiple conservative judges wasn't on the up and up. Didn't stop Mr. "unmasking" who didn't even read the FISA docs to pull his side show. This article is basically showing you, that's a nice thought but it has effects.
@KBabbs_Miller Agreed!	The IG, and the FISA judges, exactly the people who the intel committee majority stooges DID NOT bring their concerns to. Instead a memo was drafted that now has every field agent wondering if what they write now will be used as ammo in a political clown show.

@FoxNews @JuddBerger Salacious and unverified referred to the seedy sexual portion of the dossier. Why don't you guys try being honest rather then do your best to walk your viewers to bs conclusions. Show us info that is factual. Show us what in the dossier has been proven false.
@FoxNews More policing of opinions Fox? Let's keep acting like showing text messages showing bias is the same as evidence of their work being bias due to their opinions. Sad you guys purposely mislead Americans daily.

@NPR Nothing says we are ready to defend against a cyber attack like a tank down Pennsylvania ave.
@hollywoodhillsv @NRO @DavidAFrench No, Trump put the FBI in a bind by trying to discredit them to avoid prosecution. You do realize Hannity is required to classify himself as an entertainer and not a real journalist? He just does so conspicuously enough that some may miss it. Hyperbolic and factless shit spewer
@dulces_exuviae @NRO @DavidAFrench You sound like you're angry. A natural response to being fed fear mongering garbage used to indoctrinate. Shame. Nothing in the article falls in to the "seething hate" category, your response does. You may have misheard Trump, but he said he'd like a parade LIKE FRANCE. Hooray
@NRO @KevinNR Yes, nothing says lack of regard for taxpayer money like a f'ng parade. Trump said "like France"....
@Matt_Bo4 @NRO @DavidAFrench The fact is, there is a road the intel committee could have walked if they had REAL concern about the FISA, ie the judges and the IG. They don't give a f about "abuses" otherwise they would have spoken to either. Plain as day political stunt in an attempt to discredit investigatn
@Matt_Bo4 @NRO @DavidAFrench The FISA was signed off by multiple conservative judges. The idea that it was partisan and that wasn't disclosed we now know was bull. The idea it was fake because it is partisan is without logic if no evidence shown. So what exactly about the memo proved corruption?
@Matt_Bo4 @NRO @DavidAFrench Well, let's talk about that. #1 Zero corruption shown. The claim is it was obtained by using the dossier as evidence. The dossier being assumed "fake". Well, so far, what in the dossier has been proven to be fake? What other FISA docs were used to obtain warrant 4 times?
@NRO @DavidAFrench They were removed by Mueller when he found out they were using biz phones only for the reason that exists now. Optics. Yet right wings have held fooking text messages up as if they're proof of anything directly. Is there ANY evidence that shows "corruption"?I'd love to hear it
@NRO @DavidAFrench The issue with the Strzok talking point that is the most frustrating is WE ARE NOT in the business of policing opinions. There has been zero evidence that their regeritated opinions of Trump, shared by millions btw, had ANY effect on their investigation. Zero logic

@BigMRboston @Anotherfaze @DevinNunes That's a great hate speech. Please let me know if you have any facts you'd like to debate. 	FOX needs to REQUIRE Hannity to disclose he is an entertainer not a journalist in a less inconspicuous way. Brett Baire is ok
@2Scoops12Cokes @FoxNews @FBI @TheJusticeDept FISA docs signed off by FOUR judges, NOT based on dossier. Courts MADE AWARE of possible political bias. Showing 5% of evidence provided for FISA approval and calling it abuse is LYING
@FoxNews @RepMattGaetz @YahooNews Claims loosely based on facts ARE LIES. Fox must be held accountable since there is no line of integrity lacking reporting they won't cross.
@FoxNews Fox news must require Hannity make CLEAR to his viewers that he is an ENTERTAINER and NOT a journalist.
@FoxNews @FBI @TheJusticeDept FACTS MATTER. Fox complicit in treason
@PRyan You allow members to undermine an ongoing investigation as well as the top agencies of our country with a veiled motive of transparency. You've disgraced your position and the people you've sworn to serve demand your resignation sir.

@agueros_henry Except facts matter and policing feelings or opinions as if they equate to corruption is anti American	Understand that Hannity IS NOT NEWS, the disclaimers are so small maybe you don‚Äôt know that

@DevinNunes Thanks for undermining the FBI and a ongoing investigation with your bullshit memo you twit. Hooray...		GOP went full Nunes
@NRO @RichLowry @DevinNunes Phase 2!!!	traitor pos @DevinNunes
@NRO @RichLowry Oh and dumbfuck @DevinNunes basically said he‚Äôs investigating which we see means scheming on the DOJ as the cherry on top. GOP got Nunes‚Äôd
@NRO @RichLowry Are you guys misleading or ignorant? You think an effort to undermining the FBI and completely discrediting the intel committee is not a threat?
@ObligedFriend @MyDogNose @thehill Prove it? Prove that the memo is trash? It‚Äôs 3.5 pages and the last page discredits the first 3. Try reading it
@ObligedFriend @MyDogNose @thehill I‚Äôd love to see the IG report when available	The memo is and should be a damn embarrassment to the GOP	They undermine our FBI for that piece of trash?
@DevinNunes I don‚Äôt think the people liking my post understand what the meaning of -you got Nunes‚Äôd means	#yomemojoke
@ObligedFriend @MyDogNose @thehill *The memo is toilet paper, controversial would be playing it up
@ObligedFriend @MyDogNose @thehill After reading 3.5 Page memo and 37X Page Fusion testimony. I can confirm absolutely that is true
@DevinNunes You Nunes‚Äôd the GOP good brah

@Rystalship @washingtonpost No danger in the effort to undermine the FBI and the DOJ in obvious attempt to stop investigation? Does nothing to those agents in the field who put info together in these investigations, is that your claim?

@SkipGlitch @Reuters @ReutersTV and we can very, very generally quantify the evidence provided by the memo. The FISA docs this memo represents have been confirmed as being 50 pages. While the memo has already been SHOWN not stated as being misleading, that's ~7%. If I showed you 7% of a photo, guess whats in it
@SkipGlitch @Reuters @ReutersTV Well, your statement would have been more accurate with "What *I think* happened.		Agree on judgement, and it's refreshing to have made it this far without name calling and talking point hyperbole that usually make it in by response number 1
