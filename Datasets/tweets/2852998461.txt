I hoped it wouldn’t get to a point where the president contemplated declaring a national emergency. This is a failure of Congress. We must return to regular order and pass clean, timely appropriations bills. Anything less is political gamesmanship and harmful to Americans.
Democratic leadership has also waited three weeks to act on border funding, and in the eleventh hour -- as the government is on the brink of needlessly shutting down for the second time this year -- they negotiate a bill and attempt to force it through the legislative process.
This is déjà vu all over again: another massive spending bill with limited time to read it. Conference members had just one hour to review the provisions, the bill was filed after 1 am, and members are expected to digest almost 1,200 pages of text in time for a vote at 9 pm.

96% of women who enter Planned Parenthood's doors are sold an abortion, as opposed to receiving prenatal care or adoption referral. In contrast, the pro-life movement supports over 2,600 pregnancy centers, and provided 2 million people with free services in 2017 alone.
Annual reports from @PPFA show that their doctors have performed over 7.6 million abortions -- that's over twice the amount of American deaths than in the Revolutionary War, Civil War, World Wars I and II, Korean War, and Vietnam War combined.

It was my honor to defend the right to life today on the House floor. I will continue working to ensure that our taxpayer dollars do not fund a procedure that contradicts the core founding principles of our freedom and nation.
Abortion is not a human right. Abortion is death, and it is the exact opposite of the fundamental right to life. As freedom-loving Americans, we cannot back down from the fight to protect life and to protect those who can't protect themselves.
Unfortunately, @PPFA has a logic problem. CEO @CecileRichards tweeted last week that Planned Parenthood's mission is “providing, protecting and expanding access to abortion and reproductive health care,” calling an abortion procedure a “fundamental human right.”
Our Founding Fathers articulated that all are created equal, and that we are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights: LIFE, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These are the human rights that encompass the American way and are the logical foundation for freedom.

3) Treacherous conditions and corruption add to the severity of the situation. @MSF_USA estimates that 31% of women and 17% of men are sexually assaulted on their journeys north, and border patrol agents rescue at least 4,300 people in distress each year.
2) Criminals and gang members are taking advantage of a weak border. DHS reported arresting 17,000 adults at the border with existing criminal records, and 6,000 gang members, including MS-13. Each year, criminal organizations gain $2.5 billion in profit from migrant smuggling.
1) Illegal drugs are streaming across the southern border. DHS Secretary @SecNielsen reports that in 2018, agents seized 282,000 lbs of cocaine, 248,000 lbs of meth, 6,500 lbs of heroin, and 2,400 lbs of fentanyl. That amount of fentanyl alone is over 500 million lethal doses.

@freeusa6042 @NatResources We have to do more than blame climate change for the fires. Active management is key. If we reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires, we put less CO2 into the air and the forest can do its job - sequestering CO2. That's a huge win for the environment. (2/2)
@freeusa6042 @NatResources I am a Yale-educated forester. I am not denying science. I am trying to use science to reduce the risk of future catastrophic fires. If we reduce the fuel load using targeted, scientifically-sound thinning, fewer acres burn and it will be easier to contain fires. (1/2)

@SaggSyndicate @NatResources It is called silviculture, the practice of forestry. As an educated and licensed forester, I can tell you that simply blaming it on climate change doesn't fix the problem. Forests need active management to stay healthy and resilient. #FactsMatter
@freeusa6042 @NatResources We can't just blame global warming and do nothing to fix this problem of overgrown, diseased forests. As a forester by education and trade, I have seen active management of the forests work. Not managing the forests is what created the current situation.

RT @myARDOT: Advisory: Arkansas is at high risk of wildfires due to lack of rainfall and low humidity. Use caution. https://t.co/GqtP2jdjio
The threat of wildfires continues to grow. Listen to your local officials and do not burn if your county is under a burn ban. More info: https://t.co/akhdgFWWuc https://t.co/cfABp9jpnY
@StevenO420 Yes, it is federal law. All American males must register when they turn 18.
@StevenO420 I held an event in April 2017 in HSV and another in HS in October 2016. I'm sorry you were unable to attend. You can find a list of events on my website: https://t.co/JDNZFUCdR0		But please understand I can't do everything in Hot Springs. #ar4 is a large district.
@StevenO420 The following video is a prime example of supporters and non-supporters participating in a "Coffee with your Congressman." This is exactly what you've been asking me to do. https://t.co/snbFqordDe
@StevenO420 I have held a variety of events across #ar4. Some have high attendance, others do not. I take questions from my constituents and engage with them, just like I am doing with you right now. Not everyone agrees with me, just like you don't. Why do you think only supporters show up?
@StevenO420 I have held many events with constituents and have heard their stories about how their premiums have increased to unaffordable levels and how they can't use their coverage because of sky-high deductibles. What good is insurance if you can't afford to use it?
@StevenO420 Everyone says that, but they speak without knowing the truth: I am on Obamacare. I know how bad it is because I have it, as does my family and staff. I don't use talking points, I speak from experience. Thanks for reaching out, but I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.
The wildfire threat is increasing across Ark. Watch this report from @KNWAnews's @CChambersNWA​ on why you should take the threat seriously. https://t.co/BkV0dfpm3R
@StevenO420 You can't honestly say the ACA has been successful. In many states &amp; counties, there is only one insurer &amp; premiums are through the roof. This is not working for the American people &amp; not working for Arkansans. We have to find a solution for providing coverage &amp; the ACA isn't it.
