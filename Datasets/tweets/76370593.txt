@realDonaldTrump 3. You said "they're pretty tough people... women don't want them in our country. Women want security. Men don't want them. But women don't want them in our country, they want security." Is this based on polling data? If so - source?
@realDonaldTrump 2. You when you mentioned "rocks = firearms," were you authorizing the US military to fire on unarmed people? Only those throwing rocks or also those holding rocks? Only rocks or throwing anything? Throwing or appearing to throw? This needs clarification.
@realDonaldTrump Could you clarify a couple of things:	1. You said "we're not releasing them anymore" but ICE has been releasing loads of detainees over the past few days, overwhelming churches and other non-profits. Can you reconcile those two facts?
RT @keanothedog: @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/p0d2wCH6sv
@realDonaldTrump (re: family separation): Obama separated families... All I did was take the same law and soften the law.
Trump: Anybody throwing rocks - we will consider that a firearm.
Trump (re: caravan): all we know is they're pretty tough people. I don't want them in our country. And women don't want them in our country. Women want security. Men don't want them in our country. But women don't want them because women want security.
