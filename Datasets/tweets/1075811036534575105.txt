@413LifeOf @lizzwinstead Abortion data is quite hard to come by for some reason, but here is a quick bibliography.		I tried to pick (only) sites you'd approve of‚Ä¶ these are the most recent estimates from each.		Although I admit, *one is of ill-repute* and has a habit of fudging numbers... (@PPFA)
@413LifeOf @lizzwinstead Sorry for delay, baby needed to rest. 		The number I quoted before was actually from 2014 (the most recent yr available), so I apologize. Also, the number is 926,200. 		The number is from Guttmacher Institute, named for the former president of Planned Parenthood.

@413LifeOf @lizzwinstead 900k babies snuffed our last year (US only)
@DJPaulV @lizzwinstead This is how humans respond to children in need of nurture and care.
@demimondatron @lizzwinstead What is the difference exactly?
@dorkdorkdork2 @lizzwinstead Does it have it‚Äôs own DNA or the parents?
@lizzwinstead No, just a human. Just like that ‚Äúmedical waste‚Äù, in fact.
@lizzwinstead I‚Äôm not trying to change your mind, just provide you a mirror.
@lizzwinstead How could you call babies ‚Äúmedical waste‚Äù. I‚Äôm holding my newborn as I type this. Children are to be prized and esteemed and respected and cherished.
@code_slinger @laurenarankin This economic theory is devoid of any sense of morality.

@CecileRichards as we head into a presidential election?
@CecileRichards When you say ‚Äúall people‚Äù, do you include or exclude babies?
@CecileRichards This poll is 6 months old. Also, there was a 1% change in opinion over 5 years.
