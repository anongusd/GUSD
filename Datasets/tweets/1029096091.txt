Since the shooting in Parkland, Florida last year, Senate Democrats have put forth 13 gun violence prevention bills. Senate Republicans struck all 13 bills down in committee, preventing them from reaching the Senate floor for a vote. Our children deserve better. #NeverAgain
In Virginia alone, more than 950 people lose their lives as a result of gun violence each year. In 2017, 45 children (ages 0-17) died by firearms, a 150% increase from 2013, and the most since 1982.
Since the shooting took place on February 14, 2018, there has been no meaningful gun violence prevention legislation to pass the Virginia Senate.
Today, Senate Dems are honoring the 17 students and staff members of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who were killed as a result of a senseless act of gun violence one year ago.
#ICYMI Senate Democrats fought to block a ban on Virginia's ability to participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gad Initiative but Senate Republicans forced the anti-climate change measure through.
