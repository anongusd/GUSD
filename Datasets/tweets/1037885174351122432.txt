@realDonaldTrump You will get your iron curtain soon.
@realDonaldTrump 30+ indictments.  Some pleas.  More crime than at any border. Obviously the wall will not stop criminals in this administration. How about a firewall and not opening a back channel or lifting sanctions on Russia.
@michellemalkin So if you are against immigration how did you and Jeanine's ancestors get here? Weren't they mistreated?  I know you decided that to get out of it you would sleep with your oppressors.  Others choose other ways to deal with it.
@catoletters @wjappe @rezaaslan @robbysoave They just didn't expect an old man not to run from their mob.
@swirler @jtkola @BeanfromPa @rezaaslan Uhhhhh, yeah.  Because it was white people who faced slavery and genocide and have all the nation's resources while doing the least work.
@michellemalkin I guess because you sleep with a White man every White man has to be right when contending with Nonwhite people
@JudgeJeanine @michellemalkin You two alleyways need to fact check President Pinocchio.
@JudgeJeanine @charliekirk11 Neither you nor the doofus is in the white house challenged Brian Kemp's voter purge of Black and Native Americans.
@JudgeJeanine @charliekirk11 Thought you said you were champion of the underdog.  Seems like you are #addictedtoKoch brothers, Mercers, detention center prison industrial complex profiteers among others.  The wall will lead to confiscation of private land from the underdog you claim to defend.
Republicans don't disagree with Steve King and Donald Trump on white supremacy, gender bias, and classism. They agree on robbing people of rights and resources for rich lobbyists. But like most good thieves they hate travelling with a noisy thief.		https://t.co/aSrcLpaEsv

@realDonaldTrump Confession: If you were looking for a reason to impeach me, the #shutdown is it. I bleed federal security &amp; investigative agencies&amp;  vital services to erect a monument to white supremacy. I work with the Russian and Italian mafias and crooked world govt but demonize immigrants.
@JxhnBinder Aren't you the illegal alien who took over this country from the people who had it before? This shows that you are the actual danger to the country.	https://t.co/JRMXyex1ZM	https://t.co/spvGCdtRSP	https://t.co/DPij5XuWYC
@realDonaldTrump #borderinsecurity Care so much about security?  I guess that is why the agencies responsible for security and policing are being squeezed by the shutdown.  https://t.co/W8MJ1wgC2G
@realDonaldTrump If your parents had protected their southern borders, you and your hatchlings would not have invaded our world.
@realDonaldTrump @wef I wish your mom and dad protected their Southern borders.  We wouldn't be having this problem now.
@TomiLahren In favor of security, but ignores Russian breaches? In favor of security, but won't open government so TSA can secure planes, where crime involving other countries actually happens. Dropped white supremacists from terrorist watchlist though most terrorism is domestic &amp; white.
@JxhnBinder The wall is greed.  Religion and morals for Republicans is only a PR stunt. All Republicans agree on 2 things.  Greed and racism.  That is the only thing that excites the deplorables, right wing clergy, and oligarchs.	 https://t.co/C2UoKR65gm
@cindyhydesmith Slow down with the dictator talk.  I will be one someday and I will need the same support received by tyrants I admire like Andrew Jackson, MBS, Vladimir Putin, and Rocketman.
@cindyhydesmith Yes.  Paying off his tax debt was dumb.  I don't pay taxes.  I let the poor people do that for me.
I was thinking orange skin would look good with an orange jumpsuit.
@StormyDaniels Same here.
@cindyhydesmith My endorsement to Jeckyll Hyde for helping rebuild the wall...between the North and South in America.  She obviously loves lynching and the confed flag, says she loves jefferson davis, supported segregated schools, and is all about voter suppression.		https://t.co/HjWyQna0fp

@realDonaldTrump Guess Obama had his foot on the pedal.  I jumped in the car, it was already accelerating.  Don't even have to put my foot on pedal. Can even shift to reverse.  By the time the car stops and starts accelerating in reverse, a Democrat will have to clean up for me like at home.
@realDonaldTrump My wife is a paid professional, so I know one when I see one.
@realDonaldTrump I think during plantation rape, the white women used to ignore the screams of the enslaved being raped, and used to stand next to their husbands in support of them in order to avoid being locked in attics as spinsters.  I believe this is what they want to conserve #MAGA
@KurtRussellLA @realDonaldTrump I'm the noisiest burglar in history, stealing in plain sight.  Kushners &amp; Trumps have been lawbreakers, conmen, racists, &amp; jailbirds long time.  The system enables/worships mediocre white men who fumble 2 steps from 3rd base, coats them with teflon, and calls them miracles. #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump The Mercers, Kochs, criminal Kushners and Trumps, the Russian and Italian mobs, the KKK, Breitbart and the Nazis are the dignified professionals that I have elevated to the highest positions in the land.
@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo We had a meeting experienced dictator to new dictator.
@realDonaldTrump The cross burning second amendment Nazi mob and terrorists are the exception of course.
Democrats thought Bush was different from me, but Bush was a drunken white frat boy too from Yale too. The Republican party appeals to the drunken white frat boy in everyone.
@MalcolmNance I want to impeach myself, but I seem to have gotten stuck to my white house throne, uh chair.  I was thinking an extraction team or forklift to get me out.  Any ideas?
@joncoopertweets It reminds me of the frog prince. I thought they would all get sick of kissing this toad, but they looked past the warts and saw my castle.
They criticize me for wearing orange makeup.  I wear makeup because if you saw my real face, you would run for your life.
They say the FBI didn't interview anyone.  Well they didn't because I gave them all of the outcomes I wanted to see.
@realDonaldTrump I will put you to work, not saying I am going to pay you.  In fact you will go hungry.  But you will work.
My base expects commitment.I just wanted to spend the night.
@newtgingrich Big win for drunken white frat boys in America!
@realDonaldTrump ...yet no one can top the carnival barkers in my employ, and the sluggers were a hit!
@SenBobCorker Ahh. Corner.  My favorite lapdog.
Lindsay Graham with and without makeup.  Which one do you like better? I think the drunken rich white frat boys network prefer him without makeup.		https://t.co/llbZS9iIkq
@realDonaldTrump GOP, party of actor Reagan needs to take a makeup break. Brett Kavanaugh wants to be a Supreme Court justice, but doesn't trust FBI/due process.  He changed his view on lie detectors, &amp; is afraid to take one. Dr Ford took one.  His accusers run to the FBI, he runs away.
@realDonaldTrump ...so bad the way Kavanaugh has been treated.  They bring out woman after woman, just like I did to Hillary at our debates.
The reason we need the populist movement is that rich people always need a guard dog and a bouncer.  While we party, he stands outside with a mean face and keep people out and then we throw him some scraps when the party is over.  		https://t.co/ltVssj8juq
