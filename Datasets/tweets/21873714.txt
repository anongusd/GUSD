During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation #GOPResponse
South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley pledged that Republican leaders will repeal the president's "disastrous health care program,  #GOPResponse
That‚Äôs why I stand here confident that the State of our Union is strong. #SOTU
That‚Äôs what makes me so hopeful about our future.  Because of you.  I believe in you.  #SOTU
Optimistic that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.  #SOTU
That‚Äôs the America I know.  That‚Äôs the country we love.   Clear-eyed.  Big-hearted.  #SOTU
I see it in the soldier who gives almost everything to save his brothers, the nurse who tends to him ‚Äòtil he can run a marathon #SOTU
obligations as a citizen.  To vote.  To speak out.  To stand up for others #SOTU
whatever you may believe, one party or no party, our collective future depends on your willingness to uphold your obligations #SOTU
Chang in our political process in not just who gets elected but how they get elected #SOTU
reduce the influence of money in our politics, so that a handful of families and hidden interests can‚Äôt bankroll our elections #SOTU
We have to end the practice of drawing our congressional districts so that politicians can pick their voters, #SOTU
And if we want a better politics, it‚Äôs not enough to just change a Congressman or a Senator or even a President; #SOTU
Our public life withers when only the most extreme voices get attention #SOTU
Democracy grinds to a halt without a willingness to compromise; #SOTU
But democracy does require basic bonds of trust between its citizens #SOTU
This is a big country, with different regions and attitudes and interests.  That‚Äôs one of our strengths, too.  #SOTU
A better politics doesn‚Äôt mean we have to agree on everything. #SOTU
It will only happen if we fix our politics. #SOTU
But it will only happen if we work together.  It will only happen if we can have rational, constructive debates. #SOTU
The future we want ‚Äì opportunity and security for our families; #SOTU
‚ÄúWe the People.‚Äù  Our Constitution begins with those three simple words, words we‚Äôve come to recognize mean all people, not just some #SOTU
we have the capacity to accomplish the same thing with malaria ‚Äì something I‚Äôll be pushing this Congress to fund this year. #SOTU
Right now, we are on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS #SOTU
Doctors (and NURSES don't forget @POTUS ) set up the platform that allowed other countries to join us in stamping out that epidemic. #SOTU
we stopped the spread of Ebola in West Africa.  #SOTU
if anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change, have at it. #SOTU
Medical research is critical.  We need the same level of commitment when it comes to developing clean energy sources. #SOTU
Last month, the VP worked with Congress to give scientists at the NIH the strongest resources they‚Äôve had in over a decade.#SOTU
Last year, Vice President Biden said that with a new moonshot, America can cure cancer. #SOTU
That spirit of discovery is in our DNA.  We‚Äôre Thomas Edison and the Wright Brothers and George Washington Carver.  #SOTU
In this new economy, workers and start-ups and small businesses need more of a voice, not less. #SOTU
Immigrants aren‚Äôt the reason wages haven‚Äôt gone up enough; those decisions are made in the boardrooms #SOTU
Food Stamp recipients didn‚Äôt cause the financial crisis; recklessness on Wall Street did.#SOTU
Say a hardworking American loses his job ‚Äì we shouldn‚Äôt just make sure he can get unemployment insurance #SOTU
Now, I‚Äôm guessing we won‚Äôt agree on health care anytime soon...both parties can improve economic security.  #SOTU
Nearly eighteen million have gained coverage so far.  Health care inflation has slowed #SOTU
when we lose a job, or go back to school, or start that new business, we‚Äôll still have coverage #SOTU
That‚Äôs what the Affordable Care Act is all about.  It‚Äôs about filling the gaps in employer-based care #SOTU
And for Americans short of retirement, basic benefits should be just as mobile as everything else is today. #SOTU
That‚Äôs why Social Security and Medicare are more important than ever #SOTU
"And finally, how can we make our politics reflect what‚Äôs best in us, and not what‚Äôs worst?" #SOTU
"Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?" #SOTU
"Second, how do we make technology work for us, and not against us ‚Äì especially when solving urgent challenges like climate change?" #SOTU
"First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy?" #SOTU
"four big questions that we as a country have to answer regardless of who the next President is, or who controls the next Congress." #SOTU
"What was true then can be true now.  Our unique strengths as a nation ‚Äì our optimism" #SOTU
" We made change work for us, always extending America‚Äôs promise outward, to the next frontier, to more and more people" #SOTU
"It‚Äôs change that promises amazing medical breakthroughs, but also economic disruptions that strain working families." #SOTU
"I want to focus on the next five years, ten years, and beyond. I want to focus on our future." #SOTU
Ensuring equal pay for equal work, paid leave, raising the minimum wage. #SOTU
The Presidents list of proposals for the year ahead include personalizing medical treatments for patients #SOTU
"...helping people who are battling prescription drug abuse." #SOTU
"I hope we can work together this year on bipartisan priorities" #SOTU

Live demos of safe patient handling and mobility equipment happening at the #SPHMBriefing15!
Lift equipment can help ensure better care from caregivers. How can we help our patients better by using equipment.  #SPHMBriefing15
With proper lift equipment physical therapists can focus on the therapy instead of the lifting. #SPHMBriefing15
Patients are looking for ways to be helped so they can eventually help themselves. #SPHMBriefing15
Safe patient handling and mobility equipment can also be used in a therapeutic way! #SPHMBriefing15
Safe patient handling and mobility is patient centered and focused. #SPHMBriefing15
The benefit of better safe patient handling and mobility benefits the patients nurses and the healthcare arena in general. #SPHMBriefing15
The return on the investment for lift equipment is about three years. #SPHMBriefing15
"Nurses primary goal is to provide high quality care." #SPHMBriefing15
Now hearing testimony on patient injuries and how the right equipment can help provide comfort and prevent injury. #SPHMBriefing15
New Jersey has passed state legislation on Safe Patient Handling &amp; Mobility law but this needs raised to the federal level. #SPHMBriefing15

RT @usnews: What do the Republicans think of #SOTU? Here's what @JoniErnst will say: http://t.co/YTqhImXZyz
That's the end of the #SOTU. What did you think?
A brighter future is ours to write. Let‚Äôs begin this new chapter together and let‚Äôs start the work right now. #SOTU
Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America #SOTU
"we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the United States of America." @BarackObama #SOTU
"start rebuilding trust.  That‚Äôs how we move this country forward.  That‚Äôs what the American people want.  That‚Äôs what they deserve." #SOTU
"every woman should have access to the health care she needs." @BarackObama  #SOTU
"A better politics is one where we appeal to each other‚Äôs basic decency instead of our basest fears." @BarackObama #SOTU
" I believe this because over and over in my six years in office, I have seen America at its best." @BarackObama #SOTU
"I still believe that we are one people.  I still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long." @BarackObama
"That‚Äôs why we defend free speech," @BarackObama #SOTU
"As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we‚Äôre threatened, which is why I‚Äôve prohibited torture" #SOTU
"the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics" @BarackObama #SOTU
"I couldn‚Äôt be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts.  But the job is not yet done" #SOTU
In West Africa, our troops, scientists, doctors, NURSES and healthcare workers are saving lives and stopping the spread of Ebola. #SOTU
My first duty as Commander-in-Chief is to defend the USA -- the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how. #SOTU
"and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier." @BarackObama #SOTU
"I‚Äôm launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes" @BarackObama #SOTU
"In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable" @BarackObama #SOTU
"I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine" @BarackObama #SOTU
New era of medicine right treatment at the right time. #SOTU
Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work.  @BarackObama #SOTU
"We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice." #SOTU
Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave.  It‚Äôs the right thing to do. #SOTU
And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let‚Äôs put it to a vote right here in Washington.  #SOTU
Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave.  Forty-three million. #SOTU
"Today, we‚Äôre the only advanced country on Earth that doesn‚Äôt guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers." #SOTU
"That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand my budget will address" @BarackObama #SOTU
"First‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämiddle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change." @BarackObama #SOTU
We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. @BarackObama #SOTU
" a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years." @BarackObama #SOTU
"And in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage." @BarackObama #SOTU
"And over the past five years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs." @BarackObama #SOTU
"Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?" @BarackObama #SOTU
" It‚Äôs now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next fifteen years, and for decades to come." @BarackObama #SOTU
"The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong."@BarackObama #SOTU
"more of our people are insured than ever before; " @BarackObama #SOTU
"our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999" @BarackObama #SOTU

Dr Frieden of the CDC answering questions at the hearing http://t.co/QaGy5O8G9U
@CDCgov we really do know a lot about ebola we have a division that focuses solely on ebola and we have prevented outbreaks in the past.
@CDCgov it's important for the media to provide information this is a new situation in the us and the media helps keep people informed.
Yarmuth - has the media coverage been unhelpful or harmful in having the public have an appropriate concern.
@RepJohnYarmuth questioning witnesses now. Asking about the media and their role in spreading info about Ebola.

Cong Welch is pushing answer on what we are doing about travel and international flights

Is it practical for hospitals to contact you when they think they have an ebola case? @cdc responds we will send teams anywhere to evaluate
@DHSgov "94% of passengers traveling from West Africa are being screened."
@NIH "A vaccine will be needed it if there's an endemic."
@NIH "vaccines had originally been tested on healthcare workers who had been exposed to the virus."
@NIH first we need to know the vaccine works. I can't predict when that will be. If you have more people in the vaccine trail - less time.
Why is government support so important for developing vaccines? And a timeline for a vaccine.

Nina was following CDC PPE.  Do the CDC guidelines on the use of PPE mirror international standards and those being used in West Africa?

@CDCgov issued guidelines that if patients has been to West Africa providers should wear protective gear but this did not happen in Dallas.
@janschakowsky "I still done have a good answer has to how nurse 1&amp;2 got the virus. How will make sure to protect in the future"
Question: Are there new protocols in place in light what happens in Texas. Answer: yes, @CDCgov is updating guidelines daily.
The conversation has been redirected to disposing of medical waste and properly disposing of #ebola medical waste.
The discussion briefly turned to immigration and monitoring the southern is boarder
Wax men - If we had a travel ban wouldn't we force people to hide their origin and where they're coming from?
Frieden - first and foremost we most care for the patients who have ebola and monitor care givers who are exposed to the virus.
Waxman - @CDCgov has a difficult job. you can't tell the states to follow your @CDCgov guidelines you can only advise them.
There seems to be some discrepancies form the @CDCgov regarding travel for people who have been exposed to #Ebola
DeGette now asking questions of Texas health. "Was there training given to personnel about #ebola when advisory came out in July?" Answer:No

How do we transition #homehealth from post acute to pre acute -- preventive care. #FutureofHH
1 in 5 primary care providers are NPs but NPs aren't allowed to certify home health. Congress needs to pass H.R. 2504/ S. 1332 #FutureofHH
#homehealth has more face time 6-15hours a day then any other provider.   #FutureofHH
As more States introduce legislation allowing EMTs to provide care how does community paramedics play a role in the #FutureofHH
The key to the #FutureofHH is breaking down silos re. approvals and programs.
Douglas Holtz-Eakin former CBO director discusses trends in public policy. #FutureofHH
As the population ages the demand for community based care will grow. #FutureofHH
