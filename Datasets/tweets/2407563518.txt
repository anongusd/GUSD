@miz_helen @ClintEastwoodLA @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats @POTUS We the people, did not legislate Gov. Workers not being paid during a shutdown. I feel for them. I think the House and the Senate should not be paid during a shutdown.
@MightyGopher1 @miz_helen @189thghostrider @JayPoole36 @ClintEastwoodLA @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC True, they go there when they are lacking in facts or logic.
@miz_helen @MightyGopher1 @189thghostrider @JayPoole36 @ClintEastwoodLA @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats @POTUS @LindseyGrahamSC Weighing the benefit to the country by keeping out illegals outweighs the inconvenience to gov workers not getting paid temporarily. The dems wanted the wall previously, and are now posturing because they hate Trump. We see it as resistance, therefore blame shutdown on the dems.
