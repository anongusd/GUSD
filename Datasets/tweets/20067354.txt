#Comey: if the president taped me iit does not hurt my feelings. Release the tapes!
Comey: the Russian attack on election was real. "as unfake" as it gets. "No fuzz" on that.
Comey: "Lordy I hope there are tapes."
Comey, sharing devastating personal hunches about Trump's character. Practically EXPECTED he'd be slimed by White House.
Comey: Trump himself NOT under investigation
"those were lies"  Comey says it.

lesson for future moderators: if they ask you to do the "town meeting", tale a pass, and ask for the double-podium job. #debate2016
good bit of oppo research...the anti-Reagan ad. is it factchecked? #debate2016
Wallace still doing a pretty darn good job making this work as a debate. #debate2016  He watched and learned.
HRC...nuanced answer on ISIS.
Oh jeez, that got really ugly. who remembers the question (put troops on the ground?) #debate2016
Chris was right to stop her.
now she's going ad hominem. the question is not, did DT support Iraq invasion, It's: do we put troops in now. #debate2016
the question: "will you put US troops" into the fight. Hillary answers. Now your turn, Mr Trump. And he answers with an attack on HRC.
she's nailed him on the "rigged" thing. #debate2016
was that a UFO??
just....dangerous.
@madhulikasikka pay for play issue
moderator IS biased. In the direction of getting his questions answered. #debate2016
she's again avoiding a question that she should answer. #debate2016
HRC blew it. She's facing a moderator who rejected the pivot, and she lost the mic to Trump. BIG mistake! #debate2016
Yes, Chris! insist on getting the question answered! #debate2016
Being proud of the foundation is a pivot. The ques is not about its achievements, It's about pay for play, #debate2016
this is so freakin' sleazy.
there is a part 2 to this "fitness to be president question". where is part 2?
he is going to say that "nobod respects women more than I do"
Rip Van Winkle, waking up tonight, watching this, might guess DT was out front.
waiting for the "Moderator-is-biased" whine. Just not sure yet which side will argue it. guesses? #debate2016 (I think CW is doing v well).
"You can't." And Alec Baldwin scribbles the words down in his notebook. #debate2016
okay he brought it back to the questoin. he's have been better off starting there,
okay. so it's Donald who blew off the question first. He's talking about Japan and Germany. Ques was: how will you plan create jobs?
let's remember the question: why will your plan create jobs. how soon before one of them pivots to Access Hollywood, emails etc #debate2016
"she's been proven to be a liar".   hearing these two put each other down is, once again, just sad and disheartening. #debate2016
again, endorsements are not evidence. #debate2016
this is now debate #1 redux. #debate2016
Donald totally took the bait on Putin.  Here he goes. #debate2016
why has Chris relinquished? #debate2016
ah damn...this has started to unravel. after such a good start. #debate2016
Now Trump is moderating. it's not his call to move onto Putin. Chris??? #debate2016
#antipivot #debate2016
Trump is right, It was a pivot.
she is changing the subject! Wallace needs to call her on it #debate2016 This is aobut the content, not where it came from.
Wallace interruption of HRC also entirely justified. #debate2016
Hillary going ad hominem again. It's not terribly impressive giving what Wallace is aiming for. #debate2016
Wallace: that was a justified interruption. #debate2016
"He choked." Ad hominem and irrelevant. And oh no he's taking the bait now! #debate2016
"why are you right and Mr Trump is wrong"  That is Wallace asking for  true case to me made, proof offered. #debate2016
political endorsements ("ICE endorsed me") are not evidence. #debate2016
phew! real clash of visions, values, their bottom lines. effective, telling. #debate2016
Wallace doing a superb job: pushing these candidates to establish what they stand for and...here's the biggie...WHY! #debate2016
Wallace!! great job! nail these questions down! #debate2016 So, he showed Trump not willing to ask question by giving him three chances.
wait! what's happening here?? SUBTANCE!! what are these strange lights going off in my voter's brain?!?! #debate2016
Trump's done some real studying, it seems? DC gun case a valid move.
both right now looking more at ease than in debates 1 and 2 #debate2016
Wallace...going deeper on the SCOTUS question. Like his instinct on this. #debate2016
neither going much past campaign ad depth in their answers. sigh.
"how should the constitution be interpreted?"  Trump makes it about himself already.
Hillary laying down a pretty clear and liberal SCOTUS line #debate2016 what about deeper part of question??
Chris Wallace asks a damn fine opening and quite DEBATABLE question!! Let's see what they do with it. #debate2016

@shermanmj check us out: https://t.co/9upRof3tkA
@shermanmj then it sounds like we're in complete agreement!
Now Kaine is lawyer for the Clinton Foundation
@shermanmj my view, is that that is not true in a real debate. Which this is not. Real debate is building an argument.
Sometimes feels like Pence is addressing a jury on behalf of his client in a trial
Well said. https://t.co/cjNVHc9Gbv
Kane should know that repeating the same phrase over and over again is not debating
This Iran deal part actually constitutes the first moment of legitimate debate in this evening so far. And it is worth debating.
By the way, moderating well is hard.
How would those safe zones work? Yes. That's moderating in the moment.
Sorry, but these guys are dissing the moderator.
Elaine needs to stop this thing and explicitly lay down the law. Rather than put herself in the position of  butting  into their butting in.
Ugh this framing is maddening, with Kaine addressing outside edge of screen almost constantly. @VPDebate
Yes!! Elaine needs to keep pushing back like she just did, insisting on her questions being answered. Use the force!
Kaine quoting gospel of Trump. Pence doesn't have much to come back with.
Moderating well means listening hard to what's going on. And playing off of that.
RT @CarolLangston: @UnoOne @JohnDonvan This debate format is so bad, I had to take a snack break. #VPDebate
Kaine winning this "insult driven" point. Pence miscalculated by relitigating it.
Ahhh. Pence takes the dare. He WANTS to debate the insult charge. @vpdebate
Ugh. That Kaine litany of Trump insults DEMANDED a turn to Pence for response. Not a new subject.
Elaine would do well to depart from using solely her scripted questions. Get into the moment. @vpdebate
Sortakindanonotreally... https://t.co/eddGuccHjb
First half hour goes to Pence.
Kaine's interruptions risk sounding petty, not strong. @vpdebate

Question is about tax returns, Governor
Trillions?
Pence so much better at this than the guy he's carrying water for @vpdebate

Okay this tax thing is not a debate. It's an interview.

Well, if she set out to rattle him, that part of the plan is working.
