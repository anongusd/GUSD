@DrJamesMercer What would be a way for someone to help if they live all the way in Wichita Falls TX, are waiting to finish their Masters before fostering/adopting, and already gave Toys for Tots their money? Lol seriously tho
@matthewisabitch @KamWestcott @dandrasimmons @LeeAnneLocken @CaryDeuber All I know is as soon as I get the chance I gotta go back and watch again to reassess! Lol But u make THE strongest argument I’ve heard!
@_TamraJudge_ @BrandiRedmond 😵 oh no you didn’t!!!! Dude @stephhollman contacted @BrandiRedmond about the baby! She didn’t just go hunting around for red headed babies! So let’s not go 🦍 💩 right off the bat!!!!! https://t.co/YqCnnDidSm
@CaryDeuber @LeeAnneLocken LOVE that you’re being real but imma little concerned that @LeeAnneLocken is going to betray you again! Let’s not go ALL the way back to episode 1, but maybe just watch her like a hawk jic!
@ckgoes @rangelmelissa1 @dandrasimmons @ATT Alright my husband has confirmed that a subpoena is required for AT&amp;T to lawfully release the texts!!!
@ScrappiZ @KamWestcott @LeeAnneLocken @dandrasimmons @stephhollman @CaryDeuber @BrandiRedmond What about the time Russell committed suicide #RHBH? Or the first 5 #RHOA reunions? https://t.co/8C6MH75ANv
@CaryDeuber @brittany_aclark @ATT @Andy I know it’s crazy but I STILL hope @dandrasimmons didn’t say this because it’s awful seeing @CaryDeuber hurt and @KamWestcott acting like she just served Hitler! I’m like U2 could’ve worked TOGETHER on a skincare product! And now it’s all 💩! 🤦‍♀️🥺
@BrittanyClutter @KamWestcott @dandrasimmons @stephhollman @CaryDeuber @BrandiRedmond @LeeAnneLocken SHOW THE PROOF! Lol
@KamWestcott @drewhatch @PeacockFlemingO @LeeAnneLocken @dandrasimmons @stephhollman @CaryDeuber @BrandiRedmond DO IT!!!!!!!
@CaryDeuber Girl! U are SO gorgeous you could tell everyone it’s because all you eat is sardines and everyone would stop tweeting videos of them in their charcoal masks and start tweeting themselves eating sardines! Lol Then companies would start calling it sardine oil instead of fish oil 😂
@KamWestcott Let me get this straight because I just now actually saw the video! It play before and I thought it was just a pic! Lol So when @Andy checked @dandrasimmons phone ONLY the one text was missing? #RHOD
@matthewisabitch @KamWestcott @dandrasimmons However I question @KamWestcott and @LeeAnneLocken for waiting until the reunion to suddenly reveal these texts from APRIL! Its like they don’t care if it hurts @CaryDeuber as long as it puts her on their side! Smh
@matthewisabitch @KamWestcott @dandrasimmons I see it now! Lol I still just can’t believe @dandrasimmons would really say that! I mean @LeeAnneLocken is DEF crazy enough to someone set her up! 😂
@CaryDeuber @SusanM29 @PinkGStephen WE ❤️ U HONEST!!!! I was worried you might’ve been holding back at the beginning of the season! But it’s clear you’re a mom, a business woman, and too smart to get lost up in the drama like some others! Lol
@matthewisabitch @KamWestcott @dandrasimmons OH! Now can you explain how anything @dandrasimmons alleged texted proves she was talking bad about @CaryDeuber? Because all I read directed towards production staff
@JohnKDelaney He should just be satisfied he wasn’t banned like the last funeral!
@JoelBurns @TexasGOP @tedcruz 🙄 like did you really wake up this morning and suddenly decided to put on a Cruz hat, shirt, sign, AND declare your support of white nationalism? 😂😂 It’s like a senior citizen Bieber fan who’s gone senile!
@rangelmelissa1 @ckgoes @dandrasimmons @ATT He works nights and he goes into work at 6P tonight so it won’t be until then 😭 lol #backtheblue
@KamWestcott @CaryDeuber Well DUH! I’m pretty sure people who work in plastic surgery for a living don’t succeed by fat shaming! But why aren’t we focusing on where this lie ORIGINATED???
@KamWestcott @dandrasimmons Omg @KamWestcott, replying to every single person who tweets and acting like you won the Super Bowl over an alleged lie makes you PETTY AF! The audio isn’t even playing! 😂 #RHOD
@sassygaylawyer @ckgoes @dandrasimmons @KamWestcott No. What we’re saying is that @LeeAnneLocken is cray cray and it is COMPLETELY reasonable to suspect she somehow set @dandrasimmons up! #RHOD
@ckgoes @rangelmelissa1 @dandrasimmons @ATT I mean my husband is a police officer in the state of Texas and I’m definitely going to ask him when he wakes up! 😂 But I can say that my bestie got divorced last year and she had to print off screenshots of their texts because the DA said they couldn’t get them so...
@rangelmelissa1 @ckgoes @dandrasimmons Also did ANYONE notice that this “alleged” screenshot was taken when there’s the loading symbol by the alleged time stamp? So does that mean @KamWestcott just so happens to ONLY have texts messages from that time on? Because that would be convenient
@rangelmelissa1 @ckgoes @dandrasimmons Also it’s SUPER easy to post a fake image of fake tweets. Did nobody see the movie Searching this weekend? Lol
@rangelmelissa1 @ckgoes @dandrasimmons can someone explain why @KamWestcott has been on Twitter ALL DAY saying how they’ve caught @dandrasimmons in a lie? Because I really don’t get it. 1. The “audio” won’t even play 😂😂😂
@nomentmum @LeeAnneLocken @BrandiRedmond @Andy And THEN the preview showed Teresa telling Danielle about it and I can already see that they are going to team up against that poor HW and sweet Melissa will get dragged in! 😂😂😂
@nomentmum @LeeAnneLocken @BrandiRedmond @Andy 😂😂😂 oh I know!!!! 😂😂😂 Even tho she was SOOOO wrong when the new HW said something, I was like 😏 WHO R U??! Lol I loved how on #WWHL @Andy gave props to the new HW because you KNOW Teresa will not let that go! 😂😂
@stephhollman super cool to hear your honesty! I just kinda assumed you had a perfect life but hearing your truth just reminds me that everyone has issues just like me!
@stephhollman Literally I got this for my husband for Christmas 😂😂😂 And we don’t have kids! Lol https://t.co/lsyNJ5nP06
@nomentmum @LeeAnneLocken @BrandiRedmond @Andy 😂😂😂 I just ALWAYS take Teresa’s side! Lol Even when it’s wrong lol and I’m just like EVEN MILANIA VOUCHED FOR HER! 😂😂😂
@stephhollman When we feel alone we have to remind ourselves to think logically. When I heard Russell Armstrong from #RHBH committed suicide, I cried! So if u think ur alone, just remember to follow ur brain &amp; not ur emotions ❤️
When we feel alone we have to remind ourselves to think logically. When I heard Russell Armstrong from #RHBH committed suicide, I cried! So if u think ur alone, just remember to follow ur brain &amp; not ur emotions ❤️
@nomentmum @LeeAnneLocken @BrandiRedmond @Andy I mean I can believe they employ her just because like Teresa’s legal issues and remember everything that came out about Danielle? And she’s just like actually psycho! Lol
@stephhollman AWWW! I have to tell you @ the beginning of the season I was SOOOO worried that @LeeAnneLocken was going to end up hurting you! Now I see she’s just SO manipulative that she knows EVERYONE, even the viewers @ home, would turn on her if she did!!! Lol
@dandrasimmons omg I love you but watching your reaction to @KamWestcott mention your nipple was HILARIOUS! 😂😂😂 I don’t think a single person watching didn’t feel the EXACT same way towards her! 😂😂
FINALLY @Andy starts to question @LeeAnneLocken at THE END of the episode for lying! He’s been giving her a pass all day and I know I’m not the only one waiting for him to call her out! 😂😂😂
@nomentmum @LeeAnneLocken @BrandiRedmond @Andy She responded to one of my tweets to her one time and I do have to be honest and say that she was really nice to me even though I was saying horrible things about her! Lol But I’m pretty sure she just didn’t read what I said! Lol
I’m like WHO told @Andy that @LeeAnneLocken records conversations! 😂😂😂 I wonder if LeeAnne had asked who it was if he would have said 🤔
😂😂😂 I like how @Andy just looked at @KamWestcott for bringing up @BrandiRedmond having 2 beer bongs! 😂😂😂 You could tell he REALLY was thinking she should shut up! 😂😂😂
When @KamWestcott tries to call out @BrandiRedmond for having 2 beer bongs, I think I speak for EVERYONE when I say BE QUIET BECAUSE THE ADULTS ARE SPEAKING! Lol
@nomentmum @Andy @LeeAnneLocken I mean as I was hearing it, I thought this has to be another @Andy #ShadyBootMoment but then he just went overboard! I couldn’t believe it!!!
@BrandiRedmond, EWWW I just HATE the tone @LeeAnneLocken has when she’s “apologizing” for calling you an alcoholic! It just confirms how meaningless the apology is!
@Andy did you REALLY just tell @LeeAnneLocken that out of ALL the real housewives her dress is by far the best???!!!! It is MOST CERTAINLY BY FAR, THE WORST!!!! 😂😂😂😂
@LeeAnneLocken are you really trying to act like you don’t remember HISSING @ @BrandiRedmond?? 😂😂😂 I saw you on #WWHL THIS WEEK and you remembered it when @Andy brought it up! 😂😂😂
Omg! It is just SOOOOO absurd to hear @LeeAnneLocken keep saying she doesn’t trust @BrandiRedmond! 😂😂😂 She’s SUCH a genuine psychopath trying to continue this act she’s putting on like she actually has real emotions! 😂😂😂
I think @KamWestcott would TOTALLY make something up! How many times has she LIED and said @LeeAnneLocken NEVER said alcoholic???!!! #GirlLies
I don’t think @dandrasimmons wanted to hurt @CaryDeuber but she definitely hurt her feelings a lot! 🥺
Aww I’m disappointed to hear @dandrasimmons was talking bad about @CaryDeuber’s business! That’s SO not cool! I understand why Cary is so mad but I feel like @LeeAnneLocken and @KamWestcott completely spun it for their advantage!
@CaryDeuber I’m just dying to know why the florist got so upset! 😂😂😂 WOW! They obviously have issues! 😏
OMG @stephhollman! You are SOOOO sweet and precious!!!! I just want to tell you that as a viewer I can see what a GENUINE sweetheart you are! And I’m glad you shared your story and I think it will allow others to be more sensitive to your feelings! ❤️
🤮@LeeAnneLocken’s completely fake comment to @stephhollman! I can see right through you!
@KamWestcott is SOOOOO evil!!!! @stephhollman is crying about her history with depression and she’s ROLLING her eyes!!!!
@CaryDeuber said for @dandrasimmons to not flip it???? How bout @KamWestcott stops saying IDIOTIC things??!!! Someone shut her stupid mouth in the first place! She’s the one trying to deflect off herself by trying to throw shade!!!!
EWWWWW!!!! SOOOOO disgusting to see @KamWestcott @CaryDeuber AND @LeeAnneLocken team up against @dandrasimmons!!!!! I SUPPORT U D’ANDRA!!!! #TEAMD!!! Lol
OMG! @KamWestcott STILL won’t apologize to @stephhollman???!!!! What a #meangirl!!!! That’s SOOOOO rude! I’m SO hoping @KamWestcott is kicked off the show!
😵 REALLY @KamWestcott??? Get off @stephhollman’s back and freaking drop it already!!!! You sound like such an @$$hole!!!! Geez @BrandiRedmond should be sure to not even invite you to her family events from now on!!!!
WOW! I guess @KamWestcott has to KEEP on about @BrandiRedmond’s adoption because otherwise she’s completely irrelevant on the show aside from when she sticks her nose where it doesn’t belong! 🙄
Ok @KamWestcott never wears eyeshadow that dark and I honestly was like WHO IS THAT until she said Bull and ball exactly the same way! 😂😂😂😂
@CaryDeuber btw you look so much better than everyone else and I usually always think @stephhollman is always prettiest! Lol
@CaryDeuber you’re like GOING OFF on @dandrasimmons a WAY worse than you ever did on @LeeAnneLocken!!!! 😵🤯 And I just don’t get it, did something else happen that wasn’t aired?? I get why you’re mad but you let @LeeAnneLocken off EASY for doing something MUCH more horrible!
Dude I felt like Voldemort was coming out of @LeeAnneLocken when @BrandiRedmond was going off on her!!!! 😂😂😂 #HP
BWAHAHAHAHA @CaryDeuber saying ‘u aren’t alone I’m sitting here’ salty AF!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
Also @CaryDeuber’s contouring is on POINT when she’s telling @LeeAnneLocken to STOP IT!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Watching @CaryDeuber tell @LeeAnneLocken to STOP IT repeatedly is definitely the most gratifying scene of THE season!!!!! 🤗🤗🙌🏻🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻
@BrandiRedmond WTG TELLING OFF @LeeAnneLocken 🙌🏻👏🏻🤗
😂😂😂 @KamWestcott saying the 175 dress will go down in fashion history!!!! 😂😂😂😂 #Ridiculous
@BrandiRedmond omg even if you did steal her phone I totally don’t even blame you! 😂😂😂 Because THAT’S how in the wrong @LeeAnneLocken is!!!! #TeamBrandi
@BrandiRedmond I just hope Bravo kicks @KamWestcott off the show and replaces her with someone who will 100% have your back!
@dandrasimmons True friends don’t put true friends on “friend probation”. F that! Drop her instantly! I can’t believe she’s saying that AFTER u apologized to her when she didn’t even deserve it! Plus she’s still walking around saying you “attacked” her! #Delusional
Has anyone else noticed that @KamWestcott doesn’t even feed her own dogs sparkle dog??? Wtf
@LeeAnneLocken how is accusing @BrandiRedmond of stealing your phone any different from her accusing you of videoing her topless for nefarious reasons?
@dandrasimmons omg SO stupid of @LeeAnneLocken to say she’s done with you because you went to meet @BrandiRedmond 🙄
@CaryDeuber Omg I’m dying of laughter @ your facial response to @LeeAnneLocken saying she cuts people at the ankles to watch them crawl away bleeding to death! 😂😂😂 #ShePsycho #KeepYoEyesOpen
@stephhollman I am SO happy to hear you say that by not speaking you are encouraging @LeeAnneLocken because you had me concerned for a minute! I always say silence is tolerance! Stay sweet and true to yourself! ❤️❤️❤️
@BrandiRedmond OMG LOVING how you called everyone out and LOVING how @stephhollman admitted your statement was true in her confessional!!!! #RHOD
@KamWestcott I initially thought you were beautiful but now after seeing your behavior on the show all I can see now is a superficial, pot stirring, busybody with double standards, fake person who should listen to their fake voice and take their own advice!
Listening to @KamWestcott claiming to be hungry is even more painful than listening to @SarahHuckabee give a press briefing because at least Sarah doesn’t speak like she’s auditioning for the movie Clueless in slow motion!
@KamWestcott has to spend her confessionals complaining about @CaryDeuber’s “fancy” food because she has absolutely no storyline and is faker than the nonexistent feelings @LeeAnneLocken claims have been hurt 🙄 #GirlBye
@LeeAnneLocken is going to get cancer from all the hate and anger she keeps fueling against @BrandiRedmond and @dandrasimmons! All of her confessionals are NOTHING but negativity and hate! #pityful #KeepWorkingOnThatAnger
@BrandiRedmond LOVING you telling @LeeAnneLocken how she will NOT get an apology from you! 😂😂😂 However what was even more surprising was that @KamWestcott didn’t butt in like she does when @dandrasimmons is speaking!
@dandrasimmons reading @LeeAnneLocken’s blog shows how much she really appreciated your apology! #NOT
@dandrasimmons I love how you give @KamWestcott a heartfelt apology she didn’t even deserve and immediately afterwards she uses it as an opportunity to stir the pot with @LeeAnneLocken 🤦‍♀️ #NotClassy #Fake #MeanGirl
@BrandiRedmond if I have to listen to ONE more person say @LeeAnneLocken didn’t have bad intentions, I’m going to go 🦍 💩 right here at home on my couch! She’s a total psychopath! Why can’t anyone see her hurt “feelings” are FAKE?! #WTFU
@BrandiRedmond Is it wrong that I fully support you stealing @LeeAnneLocken’s cell because 1. She totally filmed you with nefarious intentions and 2. The potential info it could reveal! Lol #OhThePossibilities #ReleaseTheCellphoneRecords #WeWantTheTruth
@KamWestcott is making me sick with her disgusting exaggerations that enable @LeeAnneLocken’s awful behavior! Both of you need to grow up!
So nice to see @CaryDeuber &amp; @stephhollman doing their best to be good friends but it’s SO irritating to see @LeeAnneLocken &amp; @KamWestcott use it as a license to gang up on @BrandiRedmond &amp; @dandrasimmons 😡🤦‍♀️😭
@stephhollman &amp; @CaryDeuber are clearly trying to do the right thing but unfortunately it enables @LeeAnneLocken &amp; @KamWestcott to continue being #MeanGirls
Until @CaryDeuber &amp; @stephhollman stick up for @dandrasimmons &amp; @BrandiRedmond against @LeeAnneLocken &amp; @KamWestcott, LeeAnne &amp; Kam will keep causing drama because they can! #UGH #MeanGirls #ANNOYING
I just wish @CaryDeuber and @stephhollman would help @BrandiRedmond &amp; @dandrasimmons hold @LeeAnneLocken &amp; @KamWestcott accountable! 😡
@stephhollman U have THE biggest ❤️! I just wish I could see U stick up for @BrandiRedmond &amp; @dandrasimmons a little! @LeeAnneLocken has @KamWestcott I know you’re just trying 2 be a good person! The drama won’t end until LeeAnne &amp;Kam’s behavior is no longer tolerated!
@CaryDeuber you’re a completely different person this season! Idk if you’re trying to get along with everyone to make Twitter happy or what but it’s made you the fake friend who playcates whoever is in front of her! Speak your truth, stand up for your friends, call a B out!
@BrandiRedmond I’m DYING to see next episode and what @LeeAnneLocken videoed and why @stephhollman said MF! Lmao Hoping @stephhollman sees the real @LeeAnneLocken but her blog from tonight shows she’s still blind 😭
@BrandiRedmond,  @LeeAnneLocken’s apology was meaningless! Disappointed NO ONE called her and @KamWestcott out! Can I get some ACCOUNTABILITY??!!! @CaryDeuber @stephhollman can you PLEASE help @BrandiRedmond and @dandrasimmons hold them accountable??!!! #JustWow #TrumpLies
@stephhollman and @CaryDeuber, how could you let @KamWestcott get away with her behavior??!!! I want to go OFF on @KamWestcott and I’m not even there!!!! #meangirl #DramaQueen #Manipulator #TrumpLies
@dandrasimmons everyones tweeting #JusticeForStephanieAndBrandi but watching has me appalled there’s no #JusticeForDandra after @KamWestcott’s DISGUSTING behavior towards you! #WhoSheCallingPsycho #GetAMirror #GirlBye  #FixYourVoice #SheThinkSheBossTryin2SellDogFood #JealousOfYou
@dandrasimmons why is NO ONE calling out @KamWestcott for being 100% wrong???!! You said you’re feelings were hurt and she’s saying it was an ATTACK! @KamWestcott is the PSYCHO because she has ZERO morals when it comes to manipulating everyone to her advantage! #TrumpLies
@dandrasimmons if anyone really thinks you “attacked” @KamWestcott then they think Trump has never lied! #FakeNews #TrumpLiesEverytimeHeSpeaks
@dandrasimmons is @KamWestcott REALLY accusing you of attacking her???!!!! THEN says YOU’RE psycho??!!!! She’s completely DELUSIONAL and I’M getting mad watching because NO ONE else is telling her how COMPLETELY ridiculous she’s acting! #TrumpLies
@dandrasimmons watching tonight’s episode makes me want to go OFF on @KamWestcott because she purposefully baited you and started drama by asking why you didn’t call @LeeAnneLocken at dinner! #meangirl #DramaQueen
