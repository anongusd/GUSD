@bitcoin_is_hoax @satoshisatria Gold can be confiscated and outlawed by governments.		#Bitcoin can not be confiscated. 		Governments can not stop merchants and individuals from using cryptocurrency as a means of permissionless exchange.		Where there‚Äôs a will, there‚Äôs a way.
@bitcoin_is_hoax @satoshisatria I‚Äôll agree with you on one point. Speculation is priced in to the current price of #BTC and other overvalued coins. 		That‚Äôs not to say the universal consensus will put the price of #BTC slightly above gold. Digital gold in a digital age is a more useful solution.		#InternetMoney
@bitcoin_is_hoax @satoshisatria #Bitcoin came about because of the stock market crash of 2008.

@cryptolili @thebryman530 Interesting perspective.		I‚Äôd encourage you to read #EverydayMillionaires		There‚Äôs some enlightening data there you‚Äôve got to check out.
@cryptolili @thebryman530 You might want to zoom out a bit. How did 401ks do over a 30 year period?		#Bitcoin is high risk/high reward.		Someone has to have an extremely high risk tolerance level in order to invest.		#Bitcoin has a very short track record.		Last year it didn‚Äôt lose 16%. It lost 90%.
@OldLtc @TheCryptoLark It‚Äôs a bit premature to do that since businesses using #Crypto still use some type of fiat conversation for a stable transaction.		Price volatility has to be addressed before the current solution (Example: USD) is called fake.

@CryptoStache The chart being passed around is misleading.
@CryptoStache Overall, I agree with you however this isn‚Äôt the first time the U.S. dollar has had a gloom &amp; doom forecast. It‚Äôs been around since 1785.		#Cryptocurrency has captured less than .03 percent of the global economy with USD facilitating it.		#Crypto has a long way to go.
@CryptoStache I‚Äôm a fan of #Crypto but misleading information is misleading information.
@CryptoStache Ever wonder why no one shows a chart of the dollar‚Äôs progress after 2013?		The dollar‚Äôs value ie buying power actually rose between 2014 to 2016.
@CryptoStache Meanwhile....		https://t.co/hTAB7xtBIE

@NITV He‚Äôs an actor and dancer and he couldn‚Äôt be bothered to pay a $1,700 fine since 2013?		That‚Äôs 6 years.		How could a poor choice like that not have consequences?		It‚Äôs $250 per day until he pays the fine. That can be waived if he‚Äôs found to be insolvent. I doubt that‚Äôs the case.
@NITV Is he just being held until he‚Äôs tried and sentenced?		If he can‚Äôt afford a lawyer one will have to be appointed for him.		He‚Äôs an actor well known enough that a number of people are appalled by what happened and he couldn‚Äôt afford his fine?		Something is not adding up.

@Eljaboom Price stability is the major issue.		Right now the bulk of #Crypto exists on exchanges with competing trader bot software determining price rather than everyday costumer to merchant commerce.		The Mt. Gox debacle set mass adoption of #Bitcoin back decades.
