@DaniAndi4 @slooterman Jenny McCarthy without Oprah is just another crank celebrity with bad ideas. Jenny McCarthy being on Oprah (and Larry King for that matter) gave her legitimacy.
Inbox: While @HawleyMo gets raked over the coals by McConnell and groups like JCN for questioning Neomi Rao, @AFPhq praises him in a press release, for "taking his 'advise and consent' role seriously"
This is a smart line of questioning by @AOC. I get that there was a lot of theatrics with Cohen's comments on Trump's racism and hush money payments but surprised more Democrats didn't ask about Trump's business dealings or his tax returns. https://t.co/RjBSkQomwr

Which is of course to say @mattgertz's mentions will always be a handful.
Then again, Gaetz is in the House and Comstock lost her seat. Her district was always swing-y so makes sense in a wave year. Gaetz can probably keep that seat forever if he wants. https://t.co/muFJeO2HtV

@saba_h @creynoldsnc Seconded on Bad Blood. It reads like a thriller. Also read Night of the Gun in the past year. Same deal. Phenomenal reporting and narrative and that opening paragraph is one of the best I've read.

Also, I want to like Holly Robinson Pete because there aren’t many black families with autistic people in the public eye but her spreading misinformation about autism and families hurts a lot.
It’s beside the point but @slooterman’s piece does show how Oprah has done a lot to propagate trash ideas about autism that are still in the mainstream.  https://t.co/cIG8sOtYfG
My parents divorced when I was 11 and while my mom made it a point to make sure I knew it wasn’t my fault, I will admit there were times I wondered. This mindset screws with so many autistic people’s heads https://t.co/p2uHeMKPEH
My parents divorced when I was 11 but it had nothing to do with my autism. Important piece by @slooterman, whom you should all follow.  https://t.co/cIG8sOtYfG

@GrahamVyse @elainejgodfrey Oh agreed that women are absolutely expected to be more collegial than men. That being said, like Graham said, she supported Pelosi against her challengers and praised her for complimenting her mother. I think AOC thinks she has a better chance affecting change as a Pelosi ally.
Well Clarification, she said he isn't a racist but said the action was racist.
Holy Crap! Did @RashidaTlaib call @MarkMeadows a racist?

What ties them together, though, is Whitney and Jimi both aspired to mainstream success, which meant white audiences. But both of them offer their unique perspectives of America in their versions. Whitney is the sultry and bluesy. Jimi is the Chaos. 	https://t.co/lMbq4QMtco
Similarly, Hendrix's piece is viewed largely as a protest but he served as a paratrooper in the 101st Airborne and he is more reserved here. While he disliked the Vietnam War, he didn't burn his draft card. 	https://t.co/3RrPgnxyAx
Hendrix's on the other hand is done impromptu. He had gone on late at Woodstock and most people had left by that time. It's done in between arguably his two most famous songs, "Voodoo Child" and "Purple Haze."	https://t.co/oxi9dMU3PV
Whitney's, of course is the best vocal performance of all time, and was done right at the start of the Persian Gulf War. It's a hyper-patriotic exercise of pomp and circumstance done by a singer at the top of her game who was about to do even more.	https://t.co/boFasqU17G
Random thought: the two best versions of the Star Spangled Banner are Hendrix's and Whitney Houston's despite the fact their contexts are entirely different.
@pinkproletariat @SonnyBunch Just take it for what it is: a hell of a good time. That way you won't be disappointed. The dialogue is so bad and I got mad at how under used Mahershala Ali was but other than that, I liked it. 3/5
One of my favorite things about interviewing #ActuallyAutistic people is there is never need for any small talk to warm them up before talking. We can just get straight to it. It's one thing I love about interviewing my cohort. @JHMarble pointed this out to me.
@melwedde Fair point. Like I said, you were more in tune with it. But I can see how he would need to keep hammering that point of eminent Domain because it was Texas. I genuinely want to know who were the Abbott-O'Rourke voters.
At some point or another, the roles reverse from parents embarrassing their kids to kids embarrassing their parents in public. https://t.co/IcapEjEMKN
@melwedde You followed him more closely than I did but I don't remember his really calling out Trump throughout his Senate run (probably because it's Texas) but this is a roaring speech.

@SethAMandel @cjane87 This is basically the crux of the book I am writing. The really demeaning thing about this whole thing is it basically says you would rather have a potentially dead child than having a live autistic one. Think what anti-vaxx ideology does to Autistic people's mindsets
Haven't seen the Favourite but as usual, @ralstonreports is right. Vice as an attempt to re-contextualize the Bush years does a good job but is a cinematic failure. Green Book has great acting but terrible plot and dialogue. Rami Malek thrives despite a bad script. https://t.co/aTa4gTzZLg

@slooterman I smell a freelance piece.
@slooterman Same on my end. I don’t own guns because I have depression and fear it would put me at higher risk. But the idea of using someone’s disability to bar them from owning guns seems pretty arbitrary.

@ron_fournier @MrWalterShapiro @JohnDingell Fournier was a bit tied up on the other end of Pennsylvania Ave., back in the day, Walt. (By the way, miss calling both of y'all my colleagues).
This came despite the fact Dingell liked to tout how he was the last author of the original Clean Water Act.	https://t.co/jflDMGM0GW
Similarly, as we noted here, Dingell's ties to the Auto Industry in Michigan, led him to lose the Energy and Commerce gavel to Henry Waxman, who was more robust on climate legislation.	https://t.co/WUf2r5SgYF
After the Newtown shooting, Dingell wrote this op-ed with James Baker III, Reagan's former chief of staff, and talked about how to approach guns in a way he could support. 	https://t.co/I2YG13qiG8
One example of the divide was that Dingell once sat on the board of the NRA while his wife, Debbie, his successor, is a vocal advocate for gun control. John Dingell retired in 2015, three years after Sandy Hook.	https://t.co/UKGCcLnDdy

I've always said the mark of a great writer is if you can make me care about something about which I know nothing (football, science, women's fashion, pop music, tattoos). Great writers can make you care and I always try to do that.

@flowerqueers If it is, then I am definitely someone with poor form.
@samtayrey Oh I absolutely did. Usually they were plays on song lyrics or something, thinking I was clever.
@stevemlieberman That is kind of what I was trying to say (albeit inartfully). Warren seems to do a better job of integrating race into her brand of populism. Sherrod Brown seems better at getting labor support, I could go on. There are definitely true blue Sanders but he was mostly a surrogate.
Flagging for later book research. https://t.co/3ZM7lzugCM
Either way, I did talk with Mama Garcia and she is firmly on board with Kamala Harris. She liked Joe Biden before and she says Warren seems too preachy/yells a lot. Stepdad seems to like Biden and Beto.
One thing I don't think Sanders gets re: his SOTU response/potential run is he was seen as a Clinton alternative/got a lot of support from people who wanted Warren to run. Now that there are multiple Dem candidates including Warren, not sure he would get the same level of support

@kreissdaniel The most insufferable and obnoxious fans who drape themselves in a poncho of perceived persecution.
Again, could be nothing but Harris has had a banner two weeks since her roll out (Even Trump says so). And she comes off as very personable. So it'll be interesting to see if that helps. 5/
Booker and Gillibrand had prime real estate behind or around Sanders (likely to show they supported single payer legislation from the get go). But when Harris showed up, she immediately started playing with the kid. Put it down in my notes 4/
Anyway, the woman was on the right of the stage and all the senators were pretty pleasant up until then. Harris showed up late (I think she was tied up with another hearing but can't remember). 3/
As a result I went to the rollout of Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All bill, which had a jubilant feeling. Naturally, they had the senators sponsoring it but also people who had been affected by the health care system, including a woman and I want to say her infant daughter.
Now that Booker, Harris, Gillibrand and Warren are all in, I figure it's safe to share this one observation (Don't go run away with it because it's only one anecdote I have). A year and a half ago I was writing a piece on Booker moving leftward 1/
Much is being made of Booker saying he doesn't want to get rid of private insurance, compared with Harris' statement earlier this week. But he's moved leftward in the last two years. He also wants the Fed to focus on full employment.	https://t.co/4omn6eTDii

@mtmarch MT!
On top of that, Booker got his 2020 competitors Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris as well as potential competitor Bernie Sanders to sign on to his legislation.	https://t.co/ojDec6BI4W
Booker's proposal was pretty sweeping. Not only does it legalize marijuana. It would also target communities that disproportionately hurt people of color with drug charges. It would also expunge marijuana use and possession crimes.	https://t.co/quF26UbvO7
Last year I wrote about Booker's marijuana plan and why he was still one of the few Democrats who openly discussed it.	https://t.co/wBpEAuMP93
I'd say that's the case with Harris. A few Republicans, including the President, seem to think she had a good rollout. https://t.co/klQsYzcYxo

One interesting aspect of the Dem primary will be the faith angle. Booker is open about his faith, Warren is a former Sunday School teacher and Gillibrand is Catholic and frequently quotes Ephesians' "The armor of God" verses.

@JustinPerpich That is a good point. McCain getting a strong third in 2008 basically kept his campaign afloat until he won NH later. As of right now I honestly don't know who the frontrunner is. You'd have a better barometer on what plays in the midwest.

@MarkPuente Precisely. My grandparents on both sides were first generation and became enthusiastic Americans, which was passed down to their children and grandchildren. My parents migrated to Chicago when they got married and I was born there.
People more intelligent than me like @nhannahjones have spoken about how Latino identity as it relates to being labeled "white" is more ambiguous but that ambiguousness leads to Latinos always being unsure about whether they are considered fully American.
@pinkproletariat What's sad is guys like Tom Brokaw and the late Tim Russert made me want to be a political reporter. They seemed to be all-knowing and having so much fun because they were at the center of the action.
Oh and when I first got into journalism, I specifically tried not to cover immigration or crime because they were considered "Latino topics" and didn't want to be pigeonholed. I wanted to be taken seriously as a normal journalist.
@pinkproletariat I am ok with the Hispanic and Latinx thing because a lot of people use it interchangeably (it's bad but not a common mistake). But the assimilation thing is ridiculous. If anything, Latinos, like Jewish, Italians and Polish immigrants, have always teetered on white identity.
@jabarilink It's not just trash. It's also just antithetical to what the data says. As reporters we should seek truth. This goes against what the data are.
What is also particularly asinine about Brokaw's comment is over time, more Latinos identify as white as generations progress. Tom's words are not only offensive, they are not rooted in fact.	https://t.co/PAbR2xvHLE
Hey Tom, my grandfather was part of that “Greatest Generation” you describe in your book. He was a Paratrooper in the Pacific. My mom raised us in the suburbs of the Midwest and I barely speak Spanish. My sister is a special ed teacher. What other ways can we assimilate? https://t.co/kUslUilfMk

@ktullymcmanus @NPR @autistichoya @autselfadvocacy I appreciate that. I figure if I am in the media, why not actually try and get some more voices in the public square. If any media outlet needs autistic voices, I have a ton of them.
@HawaiiDelilah Si pero no. Gardner is by far the MOST vulnerable. But many of the other "vulnerable" Republicans are still in a strong position. Tillis needs a strong challenger. Ernst is in a strongly pro-Trump state. McSally is probably the next most vulnerable.
@ktullymcmanus @NPR @autistichoya @autselfadvocacy Because if they are verbal like they are automatically dismissed by parents who say "you aren't like my child who can't speak." And if they are nonverbal or considered "low-functioning," the response is "how can you know what's best for you?"
@ktullymcmanus @NPR @autistichoya @autselfadvocacy Autistic self-advocates have been fighting for YEARS against JRC and shock treatment and they are not hard to find, particularly in Mass. But autistic advocates are always in a Catch 22 with this stuff. 1/2
I should note, I am a fan of @NPR. I have friends who work there and it produces quality work. This isn't isolated solely to NPR. Many orgs don't actively have seek out autistic people with this stuff.

@Les_Worse That is true. A lot of it is just histrionics. And Sanders never really screwed Harry Reid or anyone in a way that would blow up a deal. He's a bomb thrower, yes. But he still gets plum committee assignments.
@Les_Worse I think this also differentiates her from Bernie. Bernie is proud of his outsider status and not being a Democrat. AOC challenged a 10-term incumbent on his turf and beat him. Same end goals. Different strategy.
@Les_Worse You know in the past I have compared AOC to Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows but where I think I get it wrong is the Freedom Caucus is in perpetual combat mode. AOC has challenged Pelosi at times but has also stood by her at times. See below https://t.co/Yo7EYG0B8I

@dick_nixon O’Rourke doesn’t get to claim Bobby’s mantle because the kid could never make Johnson squirm. Bobby was the coldest man you ever met.
@LA_Res_Tourist @HeerJeet I appreciate that. As someone who grew up in SoCal
@LA_Res_Tourist @HeerJeet I try to assume the best in people and knowing SHS’ Christian background, it kind of made sense to me. Death, sacrifice and martyrdom are vital parts to Christianity as it makes dying a noble thing. King’s death at 39 allows people to square the tragedy.
@dick_nixon If I recall, sir. You said Caro made Johnson look like a “goddamn animal.” https://t.co/t5VmrBRtlu
Anyway, that is enough of me trying to explain SHS’ rationale for tweeting that about #MLKDay and impersonating @HeerJeet. Carry on.
King’s death on the other hand, wasn’t a part of his message. Rather it cut short his efforts, as @fivefifths writes here https://t.co/qQzI2d5tDe
The problem with the analogy and where the similarities end is that Christ’s death covers a multitude of future sins in Christianity. It is why Jesus says “it is finished.”
In the same way, many people see King’s murder as necessary to his goals of racial equality as his message and actions in life. His death shows his willingness to die for his sins and atone America’s collective sin of racism and bigotry
Romans 6:23 famously notes “for the Wages of Sin is Death but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ our Lord.” For Christians, Jesus’ death pays our debt of sin and cleanses us of the things that make us unholy.
As many already know, SHS’ dad Mike was a preacher before he was a politician. And in modern American Christianity, death and sacrifice are an important part of theology
A lot of people are dragging this tweet (understandably) for noting that King “gave his life” for equality but I think it is indicative of how many Christians view religion, sin and race in America. 1/ https://t.co/umaIriqGCg
Rereading @fivefifths’ essay on MLK’s assassination, I was reminded how often, primary and high school textbooks go straight from 1965 to 1968 with King but we forget those interim three years of his activism (Though now we include his anti Vietnam stuff) https://t.co/qQzI2d5tDe

@cam_joseph @KevinMaddenDC @matt_barlowe I think most people acknowledge Clarence was a big figure in the E Street band. Now Roy Bittan or Danny Federici were overlooked. As was Nils Lofgren because he replaced Little Steven.
@SenhorRaposa Jim Renacci!
@slooterman @apoorva_nyc @craftingmystyle I have seen this elsewhere. Might be good as a teaser as long as you adequately compensate
@ibflorea @davidmackau I tend to think that if someone admits they were doing some messed up stuff and tries to genuinely do better, we should allow them the chance to grow.
I actually like Emma Stone and her self-awareness/ability to laugh at herself. https://t.co/htbQScY37Z
@ibflorea @davidmackau I love that she had the self awareness to apologize.
The overwhelming verdict is yes. So I'll start this week.
@natalieegrim I actually thought I'd hate it but I really liked it.
Ok, I am kind of tempted to start watching "The Americans." Worth it?

Bring it back @WarnerBrosEnt! https://t.co/JUUyhNZgKf
@Hilary_W This is the most accurate description of the show since I started watching it last year.
@VWHORUSHD @KevinMaddenDC @matt_barlowe I think he gets overlooked because he didn't have an outsize persona and he didn't sing like Brian or Roger did. But his contributions to Queen were extremely worthwhile. Need I mention the bassline for "Under Pressure?"
@WhatsaTararrel I am a total WHO stan so I totally appreciate this. I agree Townshend is more seen as a songwriter than a rhythm guitarist but he influenced so many of them. If you listen to any AC/DC album, you know the Young brothers were massive Who fans.
@SeanTrende @KevinMaddenDC @matt_barlowe This is the correct answer. But his solos especially in Moving Pictures are some of my favorite. Because Geddy plays a lot of melodies on his bass, he holds down awesome riffs.
@VWHORUSHD @KevinMaddenDC @matt_barlowe Also the Bohemian Rhapsody movie had a lot of good and bad parts but one good thing was it showed how integral John Deacon was to the band. He wrote “I want to Break Free,” “Another One Bites the Dust” AND “You’re my best friend.”
@VWHORUSHD @KevinMaddenDC @matt_barlowe Robby Krieger absolutely. He has such a great groove and is an awesome slide player
@Zomgitsbrian @KevinMaddenDC @matt_barlowe See I think Metallica diehards and those who know the band know that. I would actually say Hetfield is underrated as a guitar player. He is plenty popular as a singer but his right hand is killer on those early records and is an amazing down picker.

@EsotericCD I’d also put in a good word for Charlie Watts of the Stones
@Keith_Gordon @KevinMaddenDC @matt_barlowe It's kind of like how in genres like thrash metal and metal in general, rhythm guitar players get more credit than in traditional rock and roll, where the idea of the guitar god is a guy who can play blistering solos along with killer riffs.
@Keith_Gordon @KevinMaddenDC @matt_barlowe Basically. Also rhythm guitar players, though I think in genres like funk and R&amp;B bassists get a lot more credit (see James Jamerson and Bootsy Collins). Also Jazz lends itself to bassists getting credit like Stanley Clarke and Jaco Pastorius.
@saba_h @MariahCBlake And yes, I should be tweeting when I should be writing.
@saba_h @MariahCBlake It's supposed to be that way. But it helps later when writing the actual book because you already did the leg work. I can send you my proposal if you'd like.
@Keith_Gordon @KevinMaddenDC @matt_barlowe @qotsa Also gotta include JohnPaul Jones in Led Zeppelin for adding the small flourishes we kind of take for granted in songs like the mandolins. Timmy C from RATM. Bill Ward from Black Sabbath.
@saba_h @MariahCBlake Oh and if I can give you advice, be as thorough in the book proposal as possible. The more it kicks your ass, the more receptive publishers will be. Assume your agent is always right. But also, it saves your bacon later when you are writing the actual thing.

@KevinMaddenDC Gotta also put a word in for my man Michael Anthony of Van Halen. When Eddie plays leads, he has to hold down the groove and on top of that, he was a much more musical singer than Dave and perfectly complemented Sammy Hagar's voice.
I remember when I had my first job and was making good money and went to pay my taxes, I kind of felt a bit of a relief that I was contributing back to the society that allowed me to live. Like I was no longer a ward of the state.
Many disabled people, myself included, have used government services before we ever earned a paycheck (and many disabled people will likely not ever really earn taxable income but for arguments sake, I'm referring to working disabled people). And we're told we're a drain.
One thing I have considered as a disabled person in light of the @AOC 70 percent marginal tax rate debate: how many other disabled people who work have a different relationship with taxes than able-bodied people?
@dcbigjohn @sarayasin Was that also part of Whitaker's business?
Yeah @annehelen's piece is as good as everyone says. I don't agree with everything (getting diagnosed with ADD/ADHD is a net positive) but for the most part it touches on so many things I have felt.  https://t.co/YcaqEhJ3CZ
@fodderfigure Oh man, just the other day because I felt so guilty about it, I started scrubbing my sink just as I got out of the shower, just to make myself feel somewhat productive and useful.
@fodderfigure Also, I think because (and you have written about this eloquently), disabled people know our lifespan is relatively shorter, we feel like we need to "maximize" our time to be productive.
@fodderfigure It's the absolute worst. It has been probably the most stressful thing about writing a book is that any free time I use that isn't spent on the book feels like it is wasted and I am a "bad person" for not using it the right way.
@pinkproletariat @annehelen Oh I can imagine it is 10X worse. Hell, I am burnt out after a few simple chores. I had to go grocery shopping and pick up dry cleaning before work yesterday and by the time I started work, I was worn out.
@fodderfigure Oh absolutely. For disabled people I think we have long been driven by a fear that if we don't work, we are a drag on other people, so we overwork ourselves, often at the expense of EF.

Keeping up the trend @KevinMaddenDC and @matt_barlowe started yesterday: Who is the most underrated member of your favorite band. For me, it's gotta be Alex Lifeson of Rush, Malcolm Young of AC/DC, John McVie of Fleetwood Mac.
I say this a lot but McConnell and Pelosi are perhaps the two most skilled politicians in my lifetime, alongside Bill Clinton and Dick Cheney. McConnell was an effective minority leader but I am curious how he will navigate as a Majority leader with a Democratic House.
But McConnell did significantly hamstring Obama's agenda, help block a number of judges and now Cocaine Mitch has helped fill those judicial vacancies under Trump, which will be his most enduring legacy that will last long after him. https://t.co/62eLJBKHkb
This is important about why journalists use these words. https://t.co/K1iLNaZQmG
@ChinoLatinoSJC @annehelen Oh I totally get that. Also there is a big feeling of shame I think as a disabled person that we can't do both because for so long we are told "don't be a burden on your parents or be government-dependent" but are also told horror stories of isolated living.
Fascinating. Interesting that even his supporters are skeptical of it. https://t.co/abnWLSzPmm

@matt_barlowe Sabbath Bloody Sabbath has so many influential riffs. That's basically all of Sludge metal and Stoner Metal right there. Metallica's "the Memory Remains" is basically the title song in a different key.

@ScotBertram You know I am a Highway to Hell partisan but since doing the show I have listened to Powerage a number of times and I like it better than Back in Black nowadays. I forgot how many great riffs are there.
You can also make a case for the first five Black Sabbath albums. I'm a fan of the first one, Paranoid and Master of Reality.	-Marvin Gaye's What's Going On, Trouble Man and Let's Get it On	-Iron Maiden's Killers, Number of the Beast and Piece of Mind https://t.co/Se5WBgXBis
And I am sure @scotbertram appreciates me including Powerage since it's his favorite album of AC/DC's.
@Jduckham Trust me, I was extremely torn about this but this is also a good answer (and probably the correct one since "Creeping Death" is my favorite Metallica song).
@DavidKlion This is the correct take. My personal favorites are Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town (my favorite album of his) and the River.

What I think needs to happen, (and this is why coming out as #ActuallyAutistic matters) is helping parents see real-life examples of the potential for autistic people to live fulfilling lives, even if it isn't the one they planned.
I know a lot of people who have done Autism Speaks runs, fundraisers, etc and don't see them as bad people because society has said for so long autism is a death sentence. If I were a new parent, friend of a family, I'd probably want to do the same.
This goes to a point I make about parents. Many times, and others because they are the biggest one and when kids first get diagnosed, they find Autism Speaks on Google.

@NathanKok33 @cd_hooks The trouble is with Beto is that most Democrats already support comprehensive immigration reform and he was cagey about "#AbolishICE," which you the base moving toward. As far as Biden, he obviously has name recognition, but I don't see what will make him stand apart.
@NathanKok33 As @cd_hooks has said, Beto was good for Texas because he was vague enough for people to project their ideas to him. Since he's lost, it seems he's zeroed in on making immigration and the Wall a big part of his message (which makes sense since he's from El Paso).
@NathanKok33 Warren still sees herself as a capitalist but her mantra is always "the game is rigged" so she says she wants to un-rig it. As a socialist, Bernie thinks the entire system is unfair at the root and it's why he calls for "revolution."

@bradexample @fivefifths DUANE ALLMAN PLAYS GUITAR ON THAT!!! It's Eric Clapton's favorite guitar solo.
@fivefifths Marvin Gaye's cover of Yesterday is perfection, Stevie's cover of We Can Work it Out. Aretha's "Let it Be." Also, Wilson Pickett's version of "Hey Jude" has Duane Effin ALLMAN on guitar and is Eric Clapton's favorite guitar solo.	https://t.co/IeliM97TSr

Also, and I have said this before, Bernie was always her understudy. People flocked to Bernie because they wanted a real left wing challenge to Hillary and when Warren didn’t run, they chose Bernie.
Warren May have missed her chance to run in 2016 but I will say this: every time I have covered a speech of hers, the entire crowd went ballistic. She is not particularly charismatic but she can light up a crowd.

@AgainstCures @daveweigel @AlecMacGillis @jimtankersley @PeterBeinart What an utterly asinine tweet. The fact is that journalism is such a brutal business that I thrived off that early support. It's sustenance and nothing gives you more satisfaction than mentorship.
Similarly, @daveweigel introduced me to @alecmacgillis and both of them picked my brain about North Carolina's senate race. Both became big boosters of mine, as did @jimtankersley. @peterbeinart was a big booster too. To this day, I always respond to J Schools student emails.

@hidinginalabama @Nicole_Cliffe One of the understated parts of the Hobbit is the traditional "heroes" and main characters aren't the ones who initiate the major actions. Gollum destroys the Ring and Frodo fails. Eowyn and Merry kill the big baddie, not Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas or Gandalf.
@meanderer85 @chgunns @Nicole_Cliffe Fair point. I stand corrected. You are right, Boromir was the Golden boy and his father's favorite. He is seen as a hero and the protector of Gondor and he is a pragmatist at heart. It's why he probably resents Aragorn at first because he's been protecting Gondor for years.
@hidinginalabama @Nicole_Cliffe EXACTLY! For a Hobbit, particularly one with no inkling for adventure like Merry, this was a big deal and you can trace it back to Boromir giving him that training. Gandalf, Frodo and Sam see Merry and Pippin as Nuisances. Boromir see them as his surrogate trainees.
@chgunns @Nicole_Cliffe This is exactly true. He sees the Ring as his chance to do right by his people. He makes a bad choice to be sure and he causes some big problems. But he is a provincial man who is doing what he sees as in the best interest for Gondor (even though it's a terrible idea).
@Nicole_Cliffe Here's the clip. I always liked it because Boromir both has fun but he also takes them seriously, unlike Gandalf, who is wise but can be kind of a jerk. Boromir treats them like legitimate members of the Fellowship (Same with Aragorn to an extent).	https://t.co/4J4xNcmlRL
@Nicole_Cliffe Also, one thing that is forgotten is that at one point, Boromir teaches Merry and Pippin how to fight with swords. It's a brief moment but I think about it when Merry eventually heads into Battle and Pippin saves Faramir's life.
@BudrykZack @Nicole_Cliffe Aragorn is basically the ideal man and is good throughout the books. He even recognizes his own vulnerability with the Ring. I love him to death but Boromir and Faramir are more interesting and I love Legolas/Gimli's friendship.
@Nicole_Cliffe Aragorn is a total prick at that moment and Boromir is kind enough to say "Give them a moment for pity's sake." I mean I get why Aragorn did it but still. Their hearts are broken.
