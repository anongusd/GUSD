Due to the fact that Michigan employers can still deny work due to a failed marijuana screen, it forced me to work for myself if I wish to work at all. Well yesterday,  I made my first $$$ Consulting and it felt amazing.
Lemons out of lemonade? Pretty much. 4 years ago  I was told I would never work again. Enter #cannabis and bang, doctor clears me to work! However...
@Sissyrie1 We're pretty chill in life, why would we go haunting after?
So is ESPN+ offering @SuperRugby this season or not? One day it's on the schedule,  the next, it disappears. I'm sure @ESPNFANSUPPORT will be of no help so I'm asking #rugby fans. @ESPN @espnscrum

@EBischoff listening to the Q/A episode of @83Weeks reminded me of the time I poured a whole bottle of dip juice on the seat of a guy who would stand at inappropriate times during "November to Remember" 2000. Looked like he souped himself. More entertaining than the actual card.
I was listening to the news this AM before I took Sinoia to the bus stop. The anchor described the mass shooting as the "deadliest mass shooting in the last 12 days"		WTF? I looked at Cilla and said "Did he just say in the last 12 days?"		Not a year. Not several months. 12 Days!
The road trip episode of @WHWMonday has me rolling! Funniest episode from start to finish. @HeyHeyItsConrad and @tonyschiavone24 have great chemistry.

@langilleski Sorry to hear that. I'm being completely honest when I say weed has saved my life. But, I also know that just like any medicine, it's not for everyone. I do know of so many lives it has changed for the better though..
@langilleski I have a mystery neurological disorder that's causing extreme pain, mostly in my feet and legs. The pain can feel different from day to day.
In bed already and I'm not sick.

15s :) They don't play rugby league in college here. ND rugby games are free btw.
@philWSJMsports Davenport has a beast rugby program! ND is 5-1 this fall and their only loss was a 40+ point loss to Davenport.
@philWSJMsports if you Google a rugby union pitch vs a rugby league pitch, you'll notice the league pitch is lined exactly like a football field.
@philWSJMsports Tell Scott that if he wants to watch rugby, subscribe to ESPN+ for $4.99 per month.  They have the most 15s rugby, hands down. NBC has the 7s rugby and the 2019 Rugby World Cup (15s).

Since @ElevenSportsUSA feel that DARTS is more appealing to Americans than #rugbyleague, I'm watching @TOwolfpack live but I won't say how. COME ON YOU WOLFPACK! https://t.co/rSrXNPT2L7
Well, according to my guide, @ElevenSportsUSA is not broadcasting the @TOwolfpack game this morning.  Looks like I will need to pull some shady skills in order to watch this morning.  Try to stop me. #runwiththepack
The @TOwolfpack look to bounce back following a rough outing last Sunday. They take on @Swinton_Lions at 10 am. Watch via @ElevenSportsUSA and @igolOTT #rugbyleague #RunWithThePack
@EdgeRatedR I'm sure his 20+ followers are impressed with his vast wrestling knowledge
@EandCPod @EdgeRatedR @Christian4Peeps You guys should book @GregoryIron for a future pod. His career has been amazing and inspiring.
What a fantastic win, @USARugby. Semifinal bound! #USA7s #HSBCSEVENS #rugby
Houston are on pace to score like 413 goals tonight. #MLSisBack
Forced retirement at 40 has me bored. I need a job, preferably in sports.

Switched from Sling TV to @directvnow this morning.  So far, so good. Keeping @igolOTT in order to watch beIN, GolTV and Eleven Sports. Still a great deal compared to my old satellite and cable bills.

Great second half by the @TOwolfpack. This is going to be a fun season. #runwiththepack
@MrTuktoyaktuk @TOwolfpack Haha, Kappa shirts don't agree with my physique. But, it's pretty sweet. I liked their Canada Day red kit last season.

@Pokegnek A portion of Chairman Warren's blessing from a week ago was featured on the new video board at the @NDFootball game. Cool to see.
@StevenCHunt @WMU_Football Much classier than most reactions I'm seeing.

Great effort, @WMU_Football #LetsRide #WeWillReign

@TOwolfpack @USARL I've advocated for several years that NA needs a Challenge Cup between USARL Champs and Canada's best club. Nobody listens, haha.

What in the hell did I just watch? Props to @YorkKnightsRLFC on doing something my @TOwolfpack didn't do, play disciplined for 80+
Just got home from my mini vacation and about to watch @TOwolfpack vs @YorkKnightsRLFC. I as able to avoid spoilers! #runwiththepack
@steveswanson510 @beINSPORTSUSA Fulham's match anyways
@steveswanson510 @beINSPORTSUSA Thanks for the heads up. According to my guide, ESPN3 will be live &amp; beIN will be delayed.
Fulham vs Norwich will be LIVE on ESPN3/Watch ESPN App at 10:00 am ET on the 5th. It will also air DELAYED via beIN Sports. #FFC #COYW

@WhiteNoise1879 Like selling the club to a competent owner? We were good last season in spite of the Khan empire, not because of it.
@steveswanson510 @beINSPORTSUSA I saw a story on Twitter but now can't remember where. Maybe @thegaffer can shed some ilght.
Anyone know who has Scottish Premiership rights in the U.S this season? Fox didn't renew.

@JohnJohnstath @TOwolfpack @RyanBrierley I just hope he is rated properly in Rugby League Live 4. I dont have to rely on a user created team.
@JohnJohnstath @TOwolfpack @RyanBrierley And he is better than a 60!
Playing Rugby League Live 3 &amp; I downloaded a user created @TOwolfpack team but this crackhead only rated @RyanBrierley a 60. WTF?
@TMIQueen I'm bummed that I missed it.
@TOwolfpack @wolfinaroundto edge of your seat stuff right there!
@kimwheetley @TOwolfpack They didn't play this week.
I think I'm experiencing @TOwolfpack withdrawals. #runwiththepack
@JoeFaint @TOwolfpack @RyanBrierley @RLliveuk @airtransat Yeah, but for US fans, "in store" and "online" are two different things. My non existent Wolfpack baseball cap agrees.
@TOwolfpack @RyanBrierley @RLliveuk @airtransat By the way, you guys should totally consider adding white shorts to the mix. Would look good with any of your jerseys.
@TOwolfpack @RyanBrierley @RLliveuk @airtransat I hope they make it available in North America. Importing Rugby League Live 3 was a pain in my ass.
@RLliveuk so, considering the Wolfpack's growing popularity in North America, please tell me it will be made available here.

@Dovganlinho @TOwolfpack @RLliveuk With the Wolfpack proving to be popular, I could see it sold here eventually but not initially.
@Dovganlinho @TOwolfpack @RLliveuk Playstation- no. XBox &amp; other - yes. PS games are multi region.
@Dovganlinho @TOwolfpack @RLliveuk Last version went all the way down to league 1, so I assume so. It was not made available in NA. I bought via Amazon UK.

Ok, finish strong. We like to brain fart often in second halves.

Both teams exchange possession. @TOwolfpack moved it well. #runwiththepack
Oh, one more thing, this isn't going to be all professional. I don't know or care to know the @BarrowRaiders players. It's about the Pack.

@SpeedStick11 just burned Norton! #USA7s #rugby
Congrats to @USARugby on winning the Aemricas Rugby Championship following their draw vs Argentina XV. #Champions #USAEagles
I can now exhale and put my fantasy hat on for the rest of @MLS opening weekend. Niko didn't help my fantasy team, that's for sure #cf97
We looked so poor in the first half, I'll take the draw. Let's get a W next week. #cf97
That was a huge missed opportunity. Fire playing so much better. #cf97
I thought our defense would be better but so far, not the case #cf97
Game time! #cf97
Another big win for Fulham. Two big matches coming up next week. Now I can catch my breath before my first love takes to the pitch. #cf97
3-1 COME ON YOU WHITES!!! KEBANO YOU BEAUTY!!!
2-0 Fulham.#COYW
Final: In a sign of things to come, @TOwolfpack beat @LondonSkolarsRL 76-0. Very professional effort. Proud of my northern neighbors üá®üá¶üá∫üá∏üèâ
Well my luck finally ran out. Lost my illegal @TOwolfpack stream. Luckily, they are up by 50+, so I shouldn't miss much. #COYWP
Make that 58-0. I'm starting to feel bad for Skolars at this point. #COYWP
@TOwolfpack up 52-0 in the second.
Fulham up 1-0. My morning is going very well.
Halftime. Props to the shady character who put this illegal stream up. @TOwolfpack up 34-0. #rugbyleague
@TOwolfpack scored another for good measure just before the half. @LondonSkolarsRL 0-34 @TOwolfpack #rugbyleague
@TOwolfpack are rolling! Try #5 in the first half. 28-0 with about 7 minutes to go in the first half. #rugbyleague
Nice shoulder charge. Too bad that's no longer legal.
Listening to @FulhamFC and watching @TOwolfpack . Only doing one of those legally :) Pack up 18-0 #COYW #COYWP
@allangorman I have a link I could give you in private but keep in mind, its full of ads, one of which you can't get rid of in the middle
Wolfpack up 16-0 #rugbyleague
Being a huge Fulham fan, the @TOwolfpack are looking good in their white &amp; black kits.
@TOwolfpack up 12-0. Beautiful try a minute ago. #COYWP
I'm watching @TOwolfpack online. I won't say how. Just imagining how many bugs I'm picking up, haha.
@allangorman there was supposed to be but there isn't.
Super Rugby = Better than nothing when I have no #rugbyleague to watch.
The new @ESPN app for @DIRECTV is sick. Watching @LionsRugbyUnion on TV rather than https://t.co/tByDSbIwre or my phone. #SuperRugby
Still trying to figure out a way to work for a sports franchise. It will happen at some point, I know it. I'm too smart not to.
Shopping it is, haha.
This was beyond awesome. Timbers Army unveil tifo at 2017 MLS opener: 'Happy Little Trees' https://t.co/33g5mq1Jy5 via @YouTube
Hoping @TOwolfpack announce the supposed online info soon. I got about a half hour to decide if I'm going to put off shopping for 2 hours.
Good luck to @FulhamFC, @distilleryworld and @ChicagoFire today. #SoccerSaturday #COYW #cf97

My wife doesn't know it  but I'm trying to organize a trip to Toronto between June 30 - July 3. Hmm, what would we do though? @TOwolfpack
So much rugby league &amp; soccer this weekend, its easily the most excited I've been for a weekend in a while. #cf97 #COYWP #FFC #COYW
Follow @Distilleryworld &amp; @TOwolfpack. One I invested in, the other plays their first league match tomorrow. Both could use your support

@PremierSportsTV good. At the minimum, you can point me to someone else to bitch at, haha.
@PremierSportsTV unless it's going on Pursuit Network, which I highly doubt. Anthem Networks are mostly Canada only.
@PremierSportsTV Fox only currently has Super League and NRL. That's the exact statement I got from them
This morning, I announced my intentions to run for Pokagon Band Tribal Council this summer. 2 minutes later, my website took a dump. Typical
haha, I briefly had 3 new followers with different names but the same female profile picture. The bots are working OT this morning.
I get it if a broadcaster has U.S.rights. But, when there are no rights in place, doesn't make sense, especially with $$$ up for grabs
Not really an issue with the Wolfpack, as they are dealt the cards they're dealt. But, you all know how I feel regarding geo-blocking.
To those who keep asking, I scrapped the Toronto Wolfpack blog idea. It would have been big as past blogs have been, but this won't work.
@TOwolfpack @_danmcc @LondonSkolarsRL great news...if I were Canadian. Come On Jacksonville organizers.
Just noticed Cas vs Leeds will be LIVE in the U.S. tomorrow afternoon on @FOXSoccerPlus. #COYF #rugbyleague
I hoped to follow @TOwolfpack this season but I've lost interest. No TV/Live Stream, no sense wasting my time. Hoping for a US franchise now
@PremierSportsTV You are really missing out on potential money by not making Toronto Wolfpack games available in the United States.

@jimwaterson I apologize  (even though I didn't vote for the goon)
Luckily my daughter will soon switch to shots every two weeks for her allergies rather than weekly. We've been at this for almost 2 years.
I know for a fact I'm the only person watching the Europa League in this patient waiting room. My daughter doesn't even have a phone!
You know you are a supporter when you buy a @SSFCRABBITOHS baseball cap &amp; shipping to the U.S. is more than the cost of the hat.
@MMFlint is another liberal who doesn't understand the constitution. I don't like Trump but I'm not willing to ignore the constitution.
That feeling you get when you have $9.5 million left in your @MLS fantasy budget and @JozyAltidore costs $9.5 million :)
@sallykohn @seanhannity nice try Sally. Just admit you don't know the constitution. Before you accuse me of bias, I'm libertarian.
I missed the first half, but so happy to be able to listen to Fulham win today. I don't mind own goals. #FFC #COYW

@cinematicsoul The US/Canada or US/Mexico will get it. The U.S. could easily host it on their own. They will never spread it out like that.
If the U.S. gets the 2026 FIFA World Cup, we will host major World Cups back to back (@2025RLWC). Could be a fun 2 year stretch.
I'm also in favor of the RLWC expanding to 16, which I believe is the plan after this year's cup. Canada not qualifying remains a crime.
But the 32 team knockout is goofy as hell. Should be the 16 group winners and that's it.
Keep in mind, every time this tournament expanded I'm guessing there were many who were against expanding. The WC remained special.
@madnutter0102 The 32 team knock out stage is goofy. It should be the 16 winners move on.
I'm ok with an expanded FIFA World Cup as long as we're hosting it.

@LeahRemini your show is outstanding. Keep fighting.
@Russ_Goldman hopefully, you guys  keep Floyd beyond this season. I used to see blocks like that at ND. Just needs structure &amp; discipline

Merry Christmas to all @FulhamFC &amp; @WaspsRugby supporters living in the UK! #COYW #WeAreWasps
Nice! I just looked at my TV guide and @NBCSports has @WaspsRugby vs Bath on Saturday. I won't need to use "alternative means" #WeAreWasps
@andrewperloff Ask @Coach_Fleck &amp; @WMU_Football if the @CottonBowlGame "means nothing." Stick with what you know, bad wardrobe choices #RTB
@IAmMackWilliams It's a good signing but doesn't address our real problem...ownership.
@IAmMackWilliams Which is why my statement started with "In rare exciting Chicago Fire news"
In rare exciting @ChicagoFire news, looks like we got Nemanja Nikoliƒá. I watched him play in the CL and I'm pretty excited right now.

Navy getting worked by Temple so far #RTB
I've said this a few weeks ago, but I have a raging boner right now. #COYW
This has been a joy to listen to! @FulhamFC #COYW
@NavyAthletics campaigning for the Cotton Bowl is bordering on middle school antics. The focus better be on Temple &amp; Army. #RTB
I never wish ill will on @NavyAthletics ... until today. GO @Temple_FB #RTB #cottonbowl
Man I wish I were at the Cottage. Sounds exciting so far. #COYW #FFC
@TOwolfpack Will there be a way to watch the matches in the US? I hope there will be some sort of online option. Hard to "support" otherwise

@WMU_Football remain #14 in the AP Poll and move up to #18 in the Amway Coaches Poll. #RTB
@dancrawford85 It's a goofy move. We are nowhere near ready to host a League World Cup. Union, yes. League. No.
@MyWMU @CollegeGameDay @WMU_Football I think they should go against the grain a bit. I'd pick Elliot Uzelac. #CelebrityPicker #RTBGameDay

@CNN this is like the third time this week that @davidgregory has uttered this term.  It's unacceptable.  Learn the origin of it.
@cnn @davidgregory for the love of god,  tell your talking heads to stop using "off the reservation" It's very offensive to Native Americans
@NavyAthletics we didn't play FORDAM.  Just facts.

@Hutch_James It's already a crazy weekend in Chicago. Hope it gets crazier.
@CMPunk great job so far on @CSNChicago. They should bring you on as a full time studio analyst next season.
@Hutch_James I'll give you 21, but no way USA lose by 43. I think you are severely under estimating the team which was selected.
@HiMyNameIsSeton @dpshow Guys I'm scared.  When Trump announced his run,  I said on FB "Yeah right, &amp; the Cubs will win the World Series"
Time for some Tuesday Night #MACtion. #23 WMU vs Ball State (ESPN2) &amp; Bowling Green vs Northern Illinois (ESPNU). GO BRONCOS!

My medical condition has caused me to become an old ass man at 41. Asleep by 10, up by 4:30 am.
@StuartgregoryW6 my only complaint is that the audio only worked half the time on my phone before.  Now I expect it to work all the time.

My "Letter To The Editor" appeared in today's @HeraldPalladium. Looking back, I wish I had edited it a bit. Wrote it around 3:30 am.
@HoosIrish just so I'm clear.  Thanks.
So at what point are we allowed to be critical of Abby Wambach without being accused of something more sinister?
