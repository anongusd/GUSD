This special report was produced with support from @soljourno. 		Journalists @NewsbySmiley, @ceostroff, @jiglesias56 and @TallBrighty poured through thousands of pages of emails, court transcripts, election records and interviewed dozens of experts and candidates for this project
As a result, we got accusations of voter fraud, protests and conspiracy theories. But there are steps the state could take to avoid all that. It starts with transparency.		After all, what's at stake? Just voters' trust in the basic foundation of democracy. https://t.co/NjNjVDEK53
Things were particularly bad in Broward County. Protesters called for Brenda Snipes' resignation after a mix-up with provisional ballots, a missed deadline to transmit recount results, and an admission that the county had misplaced 2,000 votes. https://t.co/5pbQebpFVd
This confused voters, and even caused Gov. Rick Scott to flip out after 60,000 additional votes were counted in left-leaning South Florida after election night.
4. Lack of transparency: Days after the election, the state couldn't explain how many votes had been rejected or even how many votes remained to be counted.
3. Old technology: Election officials have shied away from high-tech voting methods. It's almost taboo in an era of Russian hacking fears. 		But new hardware, software and databases exist that could make supervisors' lives easier. We look at some here: https://t.co/qP1Niedws3
But bad ballot design is not a problem unique to Florida. There are really simple fixes we could learn from other states, like strengthening standards and implementing ballot-design review.
JetBlue and Air Canada cut back on Haiti flights, citing February protests https://t.co/reZRHyZ4Oh https://t.co/LHoAlcsFuS
2. A flawed ballot design: In Broward County, some races were displayed below the printed instructions on the ballot. That design may have cost Bill Nelson the Senate race.  https://t.co/1uKCb1O4gR
Some argue that shifting to a completely mail-based system would save Florida money and avoid future chaos as voting by mail inevitably becomes more popular.
Voting by mail is incredibly popular. But experts say Florida will reach a tipping point where the time and effort to process those mail ballots will grow, and officials won't have enough time to count them all within the state's extremely tight deadlines. https://t.co/3RfDyaTndu
1. A ton of absentee ballots: One in three ballots in 2018 were cast by mail, and that really complicated things for Florida. But what if the answer is… more mail-in voting? https://t.co/u3aJevVkKV
We looked at all the problems of the 2018 midterms to try and figure out what went wrong and how to avoid another national embarrassment in the Sunshine State. 		Among the issues:
And the good news: The state has an opportunity to fix Florida's election woes before 2020. But lawmakers have to act.		Yes, Florida's voting problems are very real, but they're hardly insurmountable.
So here's the bad news: The 2020 presidential election will almost certainly be close. Maybe close enough to trigger another recount in Florida.
Ah, the 2018 Florida election recount. Remember that?		Accusations of voter fraud, blown deadlines, lawsuits, conspiracy theories. 		We can't believe we're saying this, but what if that fiasco was a good thing? (Thread!) https://t.co/uFFh6ENMWQ

A team of @McClatchy journalists from across the country contributed to #SinceParkland, including: @caseyfrank1 @ceostroff @Tallbrighty @eddiemalvarez @VirginiaBridges @TimChitwoodLE @lexicortes @DriscollAmy @liz_lines @glenngarvin @jessicapgilbert @KevinGHall (continued)
In order to track 365 days of gun-related deaths #SinceParkland, @McClatchy and @teamtrace pulled data from @GunDeaths and compiled a database of law enforcement media and records contacts to request reports from more than 600 agencies. https://t.co/LT1mpwzDRD
Although Parkland seemed certain to change the parameters of the gun debate in America, 2018 looked a lot like 1929, when Americans were shocked and appalled by the St. Valentine’s Day Massacre, yet did little to alter their country’s gun law. https://t.co/kjkPONzqpT
But no city, relative to its size, has been so scarred by gun violence as Delaware’s biggest city, Wilmington. It was dubbed “The Most Dangerous Place in America for Youth.” https://t.co/OCm47CXssr
In Florida alone, there have been about 80 gun deaths — including the Parkland students — of youths 18 and under in the year #SinceParkland https://t.co/B9NtUpzgTD
#SinceParkland, more than 130 children were shot and killed in domestic situations — the vast majority being murder-suicides. https://t.co/2HSGwcTckc
#SinceParkland, at least 150 children have died in accidental shootings. But do careless gun owners go to jail when their kids shoot themselves? Not always. https://t.co/lF2gDIddFz
Most of these young people were not shot at school, but at home, on the street, with friends, or while riding bicycles. For example…
On the week of the anniversary of the #Parkland massacre, @teamtrace is publishing those portraits and @MiamiHerald and @McClatchy are presenting a series of stories on the year in gun violence against children. https://t.co/g0Zupnewa7 #SinceParkland
.@teamtrace wanted to acknowledge those lost lives. It assembled a team of more than 200 journalists — kids themselves — to research and write short portraits of every victim, 18 and under, for that 365-day period. https://t.co/Qpqhwaqs31 #SinceParkland
That means that #SinceParkland, the United States have had enough young gun victims to fill three ultra-wide Boeing 777s, and the true number is certainly higher because no government agency keeps a real-time tally. https://t.co/DOaAx647Ju
After the shooting of 14 students and three adults at a Florida high school by a former student, parents and students rallied to say: Never again. But #SinceParkland, nearly 1,200 young lives have been taken by gunfire in the U.S. https://t.co/DOaAx647Ju https://t.co/XjvqMf4Cc9

“That time was revealing for me. I got squeezed,” Winslow said of that two-year period. “You squeeze a fruit or food or anything, you’re going to see what it’s made out of. I think the good times, the bad times that filled those years, they revealed the kind of person I am." https://t.co/acQtprqEE0
Winslow returned to Miami for his fourth NBA season as a happier and more confident person. His improvement has been one of the most encouraging developments of a season that has the Heat in eighth place in the East. https://t.co/99qmkQLPKW
For Winslow, it was his peers who inspired him to open up about his mental struggles. Mental health issues have been a topic of conversation around the NBA after stars like DeMar DeRozan and Kevin Love revealed stories about their own mental health battle. https://t.co/s7H28aDfsa
“He doesn’t want to tell us because he doesn’t want us to worry,” his mom said. “But we can tell. You’re the baby of the family. We know when there’s something bothering you. We know what’s going on. It was a really dark time, especially when he had that surgery on his shoulder."
As the youngest of four, it was obvious to those around Winslow there was something weighing him down. Even when he remained quiet about the issues he was facing, they knew.
There was plenty of empathy from Winslow’s family and friends, though. But there was no intervention. There was only an open line of communication they made sure Winslow knew was there whenever he needed to talk about things. https://t.co/vyICgiOloK
"There were times where it would be 3, 4 in the morning and I would just stay up until we went to breakfast the next morning and made sure he got to practice,” Rhodes said.
Derek Rhodes, who met and became close friends with Winslow while both attended Duke, lived with him during this two-year period. From quiet postgame dinners to sleepless nights to emotional conversations, it didn’t take long for Derek to realize something was off with Winslow. https://t.co/YJYkL164Zb
“There were times when I didn’t know my place in this league or if I had a place or if I should go to the G League,” Winslow said.
This period in Winslow’s life began in the middle of 2016-17 when he suffered a shoulder injury that required surgery and cut his second NBA season short after just 18 games. And it continued in 2017-18 when his third NBA season didn’t live up to outside expectations. https://t.co/0Wo00j1czC
His oldest brother described the previous two seasons as a “storm” and his mother called it “a really dark time” in Winslow’s life.
